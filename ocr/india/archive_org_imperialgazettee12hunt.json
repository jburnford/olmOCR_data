Area, 729 square miles. Population (1881) 87,314, namely, 45,779 males and 41,535 females, occupying 18,040 houses, in 1 town and 162 villages. Persons per square mile, 120; houses per square mile, 24.7; persons per house, 4.8. Hindus number 154,034; Muhammadans, 9913; Jains, 6038; Christians, 19; Parsis, 13; and non-Hindu aborigines, 17,297. The aborigines include\u2014Bhils, 16,810; Moghias, 417; Mhairs, 48; and Minas, 22. The revenue from all sources is estimated at \u00a3130,000, of which more than half is alienated in jagirs and other grants. The M\u00e1lw\u00e1 branch of the R\u00e1jput\u00e1na-M\u00e1lw\u00e1 State Railway passes by Ratl\u00e1m town.\n\nThe R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Ratl\u00e1m, who is descended from a younger branch of the Jodhpur family, ranks as the first R\u00e1jput chief in Western M\u00e1lw\u00e1. One of his ancestors, Ratan Singh, having displayed conspicuous courage in Delhi, received a grant of territory in M\u00e1lw\u00e1 from the Emperor Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n. The State is held as tributary to Sindhia; but in 1819 an arrangement was made by which the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Ratl\u00e1m agreed to pay an annual tribute of Sal\u00edm Shahi Rs. 84,000 (or about \u00a36600), while Sindhia engaged never to send any troops into the country or interfere with the internal administration. This tribute was assigned, by the treaty of 1844 between the British Government and Sindhia, in part payment for the Gwalior Contingent; and it is now paid to the British Government. The present R\u00e1j\u00e1, Jaswant Singh, a Rahtor R\u00e1jput, was born about 1860. He was placed on the gadi when only three years old. During his minority, the State has been managed by Mir Sh\u00e1hamat Al\u00ed, C.S.I., as Superintendent. Education has much\nadvanced of late years; there were in 1882, 24 schools, including three for girls and a central college at Ratl\u00e1m town. Jail; good roads. In 1883, 12,149 patients were treated at the Ratl\u00e1m Dispensary. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Ratl\u00e1m has a personal salute of 13 guns. His military establishment consisted in 1882 of 5 field guns, 12 artillerymen, 136 cavalry, and 198 infantry. Police, 461 men.\n\n**Ratl\u00e1m.**\u2014Chief town of Ratl\u00e1m State, M\u00e1lw\u00e1, Central India. Lat. 23\u00b0 21' N., long. 75\u00b0 7' E.; 1577 feet above sea-level. Population (1881) 31,066, namely, 16,544 males and 14,522 females. Hindus numbered 18,676; Muhammadans, 7357; and 'others,' 5033. Ratl\u00e1m city is a great centre for transactions in opium and grain, to which it owes much of its prosperity. Good b\u00e1z\u00e1rs. One of the principal seats of the opium trade of M\u00e1lw\u00e1. In 1883-84, opium exports\u2014to China, 1394\u00bd chests, duty secured, \u00a390,643; to Bombay, 80 chests (of which 26 chests were free), duty secured, \u00a34480. Newly built palace; well-kept garden; dispensary; post-office; central college. A station on the M\u00e1lw\u00e1 branch of the R\u00e1jput\u00e1na-M\u00e1lw\u00e1 State Railway.\n\n**Ratn\u00e1giri.**\u2014British District in the Konkan or Southern Division of the Bombay Presidency, lying between lat. 15\u00b0 43' and 18\u00b0 5' N., and between long. 73\u00b0 3' 30\" and 74\u00b0 2' E. Area, 3922 square miles. Population (1881) 997,090. Bounded on the north by the Native State of Janjira and Kol\u00e1ba District; on the east by S\u00e1t\u00e1ra District and the Native State of Kolh\u00e1pur; on the south by the S\u00e1wantw\u00e1ri Native State and Portuguese possessions of Goa; and on the west by the Arabian Sea.\n\n**Physical Aspects.**\u2014The District may be described generally as rocky and rugged. Near the coast, it consists of bare elevated plateaux, intersected by numerous creeks and navigable rivers, flowing between steep and lofty hills. These rivers have along their banks the chief seaports, and almost all the fertile land of the District. Ten miles or so inland, the country becomes more open; but advancing a little farther, it is occupied by spurs of the Sahy\u00e1dri hills. This range itself forms the continuous eastern boundary, running parallel to the coast, at distances varying from 30 to 45 miles. It varies in height from 2000 to 3000 feet, though some of the peaks attain an altitude of 4000 feet. While the banks of the rivers produce fine crops of rice in the rains, and of pulse in the cold weather, and some of the inland valleys exhibit the utmost fertility, the soil is, as a rule, poor and barren, and supports with difficulty its dense population.\n\nThe seaboard, about 160 miles in length, from B\u00e1nkot or Fort Victoria to a point two miles south of Redi Fort, is almost uniformly rocky and dangerous. It consists of a series of small bays and coves shut in between jutting headlands, and edged with sand of dazzling whiteness. At places the hills recede a little, leaving at their base a\nrich tract of rice-fields, with generally a strip of cocoa-nut gardens between them and the beach. At intervals of about 10 miles, a river or bay opens, sufficiently large to form a secure harbour for native craft; and the promontories at the river mouths are almost invariably crowned with the ruins of an old fort. At Suvarndrug and Malwan rocky islands stand out from the mainland, still preserving the remains of strong Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 fortifications. The larger rivers and creeks have deep water for 20 or 30 miles from the coast; and many of the most important towns are situated at their farthest navigable point, for in so rough a country the rivers form the best highways of trade. The wells of the coast villages supply a brackish but not unwholesome water.\n\nForests.\u2014In the early days of British occupation, the region round B\u00e1nkot creek was clothed with fine teak wood. Curved teak logs, known as B\u00e1nkot knees, were largely exported to Bombay; and from B\u00e1nkot came most of the stout ribs and frameworks of the old Indian navy. The Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s had shipbuilding yards at M\u00e1lw\u00e1n and Vijiadrag; and showed a prudent regard to forest preservation. After the transfer of the District from the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 Peshw\u00e1 in 1818, cultivation greatly increased, and the larger part of the District was laid bare. In 1829 the forests were left to the people for unrestricted use; and in consequence enormous quantities of timber were felled, unchecked, and despatched to the Bombay market. The effect of this treatment has left Ratn\u00e1giri denuded of forest to the present day, and in 1879 only 4 per cent. of the area was returned as tree-covered. The village groves along the coast are dense and well supplied with mango, oil-nut (Calophyllum inophyllum), and jack trees. The denudation so far has not affected the rainfall. Active measures, of late years, have been adopted to preserve and extend the forest area. The area reserved on 31st March 1881 in Ratn\u00e1giri District was 20 square miles, or 12,800 acres; and a further area of 146 square miles is now (1884) in process of reservation. The receipts in 1881 from the sale of teak and firewood in Ratn\u00e1giri District was \u00a3397.\n\nThe chief trees of the District are teak, ain (Terminalia tomentosa), kingal (Terminalia paniculata), catechu, shisham (Dalbergia latifolia), mana (Lagerstroemia lanceolata), taman (Lagerstroemia Regin\u00e6), and bamboos. Casuarina has been found to thrive in D\u00e1poli Sub-division, and it is supposed that the sandhills along the seaboard would make excellent sites for casuarina plantations.\n\nFrom an economic point of view, the cocoa-nut palm is the most important tree in the District. As a rule, cocoa-nut palms owned by Br\u00e1hmans and Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s are cultivated for their fruit only; while those held or rented from Br\u00e1hmans by Bhand\u00e1r\u00eds are tapped for their juice or toddy. Under Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 rule, the owner paid a cess of about\n2s. 6d. to Government for each tree tapped. Under the British system, the owner obtains a special licence at a fixed rate (from 2s. to 6s.) for each tree annually; under which the owner may sell the toddy at the foot of the tree, but may not distil it. An average tree yields about from 35 to 64 imperial gallons of juice each year. Number of toddy-yielding palms in the District (approximately), 800,000. A cocoa-nut tree does not bear fruit or yield juice until its eighth or tenth year. It lives for 70 or 80 years; and it bears fruit up to its sixtieth. If tapped, it ceases to be productive much earlier.\n\nWild Animals.\u2014Game is scarce in Ratn\u00e1giri District. Tigers, s\u00e1mbhar deer, and bears are few, and have their haunts in the most inaccessible localities. Leopards are not uncommon; wild hog are plentiful, but owing to the nature of the ground hunting them on horseback is impossible. Deer, antelope, hares, jackals, and foxes abound. Monkeys of the langur species are usually to be seen about all towns and villages. The flying-fox (or fruit bat) and musk-rat are common everywhere. The bears are the usual Indian black or sloth species; they inhabit the upper slopes of the Sahy\u00e1dris, living mostly on their favourite food, the fruit of the wild fig-tree. Wolves are unknown, but packs of wild dogs have been met with.\n\nSnakes are abundant, of both venomous and harmless kinds. The python is stated to measure 10 to 20 feet, but the species is only occasionally met. The Rock snake, dhaman (Ptyas mucosus), and the common brown tree snake are general. The cobra (n\u00e1g) (Naja tripudians) is often killed in human habitations. Owing to its nocturnal habits, it is not often seen by daylight. The fursa (Echis carinata), identical with the kapar of Sind, is by far the most common of the venomous snakes found in the District. The fursa is most dangerous owing to its small length (12 to 18 inches).\n\nAs regards its game birds, Ratn\u00e1giri is an indifferent sporting country; partridges, grouse, and bustard are wanting, while quail is scarce. Duck, snipe, and plover are plentiful. Among birds of prey, the vulture, the falcon, the eagle, and the osprey are found. Owls are common, as also swallows, king-fishers, and parakeets. The Indian oriole or mango bird is rare.\n\nRatn\u00e1giri is well supplied with sea-water fish, and in a less degree with fresh-water fish. Sharks are numerous, and whales are sometimes seen off the seaboard. Sardines swarm on the coast at certain seasons in such abundance as to be used for manure. The fishermen often stay for days at sea, but the usual custom is to start in the afternoon about four, and to return next morning about ten. Women and old men carry fish to market, or hawk them from door to door. The fish are often bartered for grain and firewood; and are largely purchased by wholesale dealers for the purpose of being salted and cured. A con-\nsiderable quantity of cured fish is exported through the passes of the Sahy\u00e1dri range into the Deccan. Small fish are cured by being simply dried in the sun.\n\n**Geology.**\u2014The rocks of Ratn\u00e1giri belong to five groups. These, arranged in their true or descending order, are:\n\nI. Post-tertiary or recent  \nII. Upper tertiary . . .  \nIII. Middle or lower tertiary  \nIV. Upper secondary . .  \nV. Azoic . . . . .\n\n7. Subaerial formations and soils.  \n6. Alluvial deposits.  \n5. Konkan laterite.  \n4. Ratn\u00e1giri plant beds.  \n3. Deccan trap and iron-clay (laterite) series.  \n2. Kal\u00e1dgi quartzites and shales.  \n1. Gneissic (metamorphic) series with trap and granite intrusions.\n\nHot springs are found in various parts of the District. The line of springs runs half-way between the Sahy\u00e1dri Hills and the sea, and seems to stretch both north and south of the District. Three villages, two in D\u00e1poli Sub-division and one in R\u00e1j\u00e1pur, have been named Unh\u00e1la from their hot springs. There are similar springs near the towns of Khed and Sangameshwar, and at the villages of Arvali and Tural. The water of all these springs seems strongly impregnated with sulphur.\n\nOn the top of a hill, two miles from R\u00e1j\u00e1pur, close above the Unh\u00e1la hot spring, a curious phenomenon is from time to time observed. Certain springs, at irregular intervals, but almost always during the fair season, bubble up, and suddenly, without any warning, overflow the rocky soil, covering a considerable area of ground. This apparent freak of nature can only be accounted for on the hypothesis of an underground syphon forcing the water through a permeable stratum. The natives regard the water as a true stream of the sacred Ganges. According to local tradition, the springs were first observed about 300 years ago, and up to the year 1821 continued to flow regularly every year for six weeks in January\u2013February. From that date to the present time, the phenomenon has been manifested only once in every two or three years. The area covered by the springs is about 3150 square yards.\n\n**History.**\u2014The Chiplun and Kol caves show that between B.C. 200 and A.D. 50, North Ratn\u00e1giri had Buddhist settlements of some importance. The District passed under several Hindu dynasties, of whom the Chalukyas were the most powerful. In 1312, Ratn\u00e1giri was overrun by the Muhammadans who established themselves at D\u00e1bhol, but the rest of the country was practically unsubdued till 1470, when the Bahmani kings gained a complete ascendency by the capture of Vishalgarh and Goa. About 1500, the whole of the Konkan south of the S\u00e1vitra came under Bij\u00e1pur rule, when war with the Portuguese wrought grievous loss\nto D\u00e1bhol and other coast towns. The decline of the Portuguese power was accompanied by the rise of that of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, who under Sivaj\u00ed established themselves in Ratn\u00e1giri (1658\u20131680), defeating the Bij\u00e1pur armies, repelling the Mughals, and overcoming the Sid\u00eds and Portuguese. For some years after this the Sid\u00eds held possession of part of the District.\n\nThe successes of the pirate Kanhoj\u00ed Angria led to his being appointed admiral of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 fleet, and obtaining part of Ratn\u00e1giri as his principality. In 1745, Tul\u00e1ji Angria, one of his illegitimate sons, succeeded to the lands between B\u00e1nkot and S\u00e1wantw\u00e1ri, disavowed the Peshw\u00e1\u2019s authority, and seized and plundered all the ships he could master. The English, in conjunction with the Peshw\u00e1, in 1755 destroyed the piratical forts at Suvarndrug. The following year, after the destruction of the whole of Angria\u2019s fleet, Vijiadruq was taken. For these services, B\u00e1nkot with nine villages was ceded to the British. In 1765, M\u00e1lw\u00e1n and Redi were reduced. The former was restored to the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Kolh\u00e1pur, and Redi was given to the chief of S\u00e1wantw\u00e1ri. The wars between Kolh\u00e1pur and S\u00e1wantw\u00e1ri, carried on for 23 years with varying success, threw the country into great disorder, as each party in turn became supreme. They finally entered into agreements with the British Government, and ceded M\u00e1lw\u00e1n and Vengurla, and arrangements were made for the cession of the Peshw\u00e1\u2019s dominions in Ratn\u00e1giri. But war breaking out in 1817, the country was occupied by a military force, and the forts were speedily reduced.\n\n**Population.**\u2014The Census returns of 1872 disclosed a total population of 1,019,136 persons, and that of 1881, 997,090; so that a decrease of 22,046, or 2 per cent., occurred within the decade. This decrease is attributed\u2014(1) to the enumeration in this District being placed in the hands of men picked up for the few days required for the Census, who had little interest in work which, however defective, would not be tested in any detail till long after they had been paid; (2) to emigration, due to the increased demand for labour in the mills and docks of Bombay city; and (3) to a movement from the District, indicated by a careful consideration of the returns of the Census, in which families as well as working men were included.\n\nThe population of 1881 was resident in 5 towns and 1292 villages with 177,844 houses; unoccupied houses numbered 16,910. Density of population, 254\u00b72 persons per square mile; houses per square mile, 49\u00b76; persons per village, 768; persons per house, 5\u00b758. Classified according to sex, there were 473,053 males and 524,037 females; proportion of males, 47\u00b74 per cent. Classified according to age, there were\u2014under 15 years, boys 208,636, and girls 198,463; total children, 407,099, or 40\u00b79 per cent. of the population: 15 years and upwards\u2014males 264,417, and females 325,574; total adults, 589,991, or 59\u00b71 per cent.\nClassified according to religion, Hindus numbered 921,046; Musalm\u00e1ns, 71,051; P\u00e1rsis, 16; Christians, 3275; Jains, 1699; Jew, 1; and Buddhists, 2.\n\nThe Hindus were sub-divided according to caste into\u2014Br\u00e1hmans, 68,178; R\u00e1jputs, 86; and other artisan and guild castes\u2014Bhand\u00e1r\u00eds (toddy-drawers), 68,039; Cham\u00e1rs, 10,624; Darj\u00eds (tailors), 2116; Dhob\u00eds (washer-men), 3601; Dh\u00e1ngars, 4538; N\u00e1pits (barbers), 8814; Kunb\u00eds (cultivators), 486,784; Kol\u00eds (cultivators), 2875; Kumbh\u00e1rs (potters), 10,906; Ling\u00e1yats (traders), 2165; Loh\u00e1rs (blacksmiths), 1777; M\u00e1l\u00eds (gardeners), 670; M\u00e1ngs and Mh\u00e1rs (inferior and degraded castes), 84,194; Son\u00e1rs (goldsmiths), 12,542; S\u00fat\u00e1rs (carpenters), 15,108; Tel\u00eds (oilmen), 16,638; the rest being made up of minor castes. The Muhammadan population consisted of\u2014Path\u00e1ns, 1681; Shaikhs, 67,699; Sayyids, 975; and \u2018others,\u2019 696. According to sect, the Muhammadans were thus returned\u2014Sunn\u00eds 70,788, and Shi\u00e1s 263. The Christian population included\u2014Europeans, 94; Eurasians, 27; and native converts, 3154. Adopting another principle of classification, there were\u2014Roman Catholics, 3117; adherents of the Church of England, 116; and followers of other Christian creeds, 42.\n\nThe sailors and fishermen, who are either Muhammadans or Hindus of the Bhand\u00e1ri, Kol\u00ed, and Gabit castes, are distinguished by independence of mind and manner, and are also in much better circumstances than the agricultural population. The agricultural castes are Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, Kunb\u00eds, and Mh\u00e1rs, who, except for their great poverty, do not differ materially from those of the Deccan. They are a quiet and inoffensive race, crimes of violence being almost unknown among them. Of the Muhammadans, the most noticeable are those known in Bombay under the general name of Konkani Muhammadans, whose head-quarters are at B\u00e1nkot. They hold a few rich villages on the S\u00e1vitri river, and say that they are descended from Arab settlers at D\u00e1bhol, Chaul, and other towns in the Konkan. Some of them can give particulars of the immigration of their forefathers, and the features of many have a distinctly Arab cast. Many native Christians are to be found at Harnai, M\u00e1lw\u00e1n, Vengurla, and other coast towns, with names strangely combined from European and native elements.\n\nFrom the time that the British Government began to raise Sepoy regiments, the Southern Konkan has always been the great recruiting ground of the Bombay Presidency. In Ratn\u00e1giri alone, there were, according to the returns furnished for the first edition of this work, not less than 12,000 pensioners, Mh\u00e1rs mustering very strongly. The people of this District also flock to Bombay in great numbers, supplying the spinning and weaving mills, and generally its labour market. But the majority, who are occasional workmen, return to their villages for the rainy season. To Ratn\u00e1giri\u2019s clever, pushing upper classes, to its\nfrugal, teachable middle classes, and to its sober, sturdy, and orderly lower classes, Bombay city owes many of its ablest officials and lawyers, its earliest and cleverest factory workers, its most useful soldiers and constables, and its cheapest and most trusty supply of unskilled labour. The Census of 1872 disclosed in Bombay city 70,947 persons born in Ratn\u00e1giri District, while that of 1881 showed that the number had increased to 126,190, or by nearly 78 per cent. About the year 1864, before Bombay offered so large a market for labour, numbers went from Ratn\u00e1giri to the Mauritius, but of late years this emigration has almost entirely ceased.\n\nThe Census of 1881 divided the male population into six main groups as regards occupation:\u2014(1) Professional class, including State officials of every kind and members of the learned professions, 9147; (2) domestic servants, inn and lodging keepers, 3634; (3) commercial class, including bankers, merchants, and carriers, 9197; (4) agricultural and pastoral class, including gardeners, 203,334; (5) industrial class, including all manufacturers and artisans, 32,240; and (6) indefinite and non-productive class, comprising general labourers, male children, and persons of unspecified occupation, 215,501.\n\nOf the 1297 towns and villages in Ratn\u00e1giri District in 1881, 138 contained less than two hundred inhabitants; 454 from two to five hundred; 436 from five hundred to one thousand; 205 from one to two thousand; 40 from two to three thousand; 18 from three to five thousand; 3 from five to ten thousand; 2 from ten to fifteen thousand; and 1 from fifteen to twenty thousand. The principal towns are\u2014M\u00e1lw\u00e1n (15,565); Ratn\u00e1giri (12,616); Chiplun (12,065); Vengurla (8947); R\u00e1j\u00e1pur (7448); and D\u00e1poli (2652). The last five named towns are municipalities.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014In 1881, agriculture supported 689,837 persons, or 69\u00b72 per cent. of the total population; the number of 'workers' being 379,979, and of 'dependants' 309,858. In the same year, the total area of revenue-paying land was, approximately, 2439 square miles, out of a District area of 3922 square miles. On this 2439 square miles, the assessment, quit-rent, and local cess amounted to \u00a394,150. The average incidence of State charge, including local cess, per acre of cultivated land, was 1s. 2\u00bdd. Average number of cultivable and cultivated land per agricultural 'worker,' 4\u00b71 acres. As Ratn\u00e1giri District has not been entirely brought under the operations of the Survey, the exact area of Government cultivable land is not known. Up to the end of 1883\u201384, six out of the nine Sub-divisions of the District had been surveyed and settled. Of 1,078,821 acres under actual cultivation in 1883\u201384, of which 36,865 acres were twice cropped, grains occupied over 1,020,583 acres; pulses, 41,773; oil-seeds, 25,222; fibres, 7723; garden produce, 11,827; sugar-cane, 6629; and miscellaneous crops, 3929 acres.\nThe fertile land is found along the banks of the rivers or salt-water creeks in the neighbourhood of the sea; but the soil is generally poor, consisting in great measure of a stiff ferruginous clay, often mixed with gravel. Neither wheat nor cotton is grown. There are several coconut plantations in the District, and hemp is grown by the fishermen for net-making. In 1876-77, rice occupied 143,636 acres, and in 1883-84, 166,904 acres. The better kinds of rice land produce also second crops of some description of pulse or vegetable. By far the greater proportion of the food crops consist of inferior grains, as harik (Paspalum scrobiculatum), 369,011 acres in 1883-84; ragi (Eleusine corocana), 292,464 acres; and war\u00ed (Panicum miliaceum). These coarse grains are grown on warkas soil in the uplands, light and poor. The warkas lands may be divided into the more level parts, mil, where the plough can be used; and the steeper slopes, dongri, admitting only of cultivation by manual labour. The best of the poorer soils bear crops for five or six successive years, and then require a fallow of from three to twelve years.\n\nThe land tenures of Ratn\u00e1giri differ from that of Bombay generally, in that there is a class of large landholders, called khots, in the position of middle-men between Government and the actual cultivators. Nearly one-half of the whole number of villages in the District are held on the khoti tenure, under which the khot makes himself responsible for the payment of the assessment. Some of the khoti grants date back to the time of the Bij\u00e1pur kings, and were made to Muhammadans, Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, and Hindus alike. In 1829 the khots were well off, and many of them were men of capital, who laid out money in bringing new land under tillage. On the other hand, the tenants were deep in the khot\u2019s debt, and wholly at his mercy, and the first efforts of Government were directed to ascertain the extent of the relative rights of the khots and their tenants. In 1851 it was found that the tenants were extremely impoverished, having no motive to improve their lands for the benefit not of themselves, but of the khots, and that a labour tax was exacted from them. It was decided to take a survey which would record the rights of occupancy tenants, and would obtain information upon which legislation could be based. The terms of the settlement were embodied in the Survey Act of 1865. The District was settled under its provisions against the strenuous opposition of the khots; and as money rates had been substituted for payments in kind, the change was also disliked by the people. In 1874, the discontent was so pronounced that a Commission was appointed to reinvestigate the subject, and to endeavour to effect a compromise. A settlement was carried out between 1877 and 1880, by personal inquiries before the whole of the assembled villagers. All extra cesses were abolished; and the relations between khot and tenant were placed upon a satisfactory footing. The\nKhot Act I. of 1880 legalized the settlements. Considerable areas on the coast and along the banks of the larger creeks have been granted on reclamation leases.\n\nIn 1883-84, the prices current of produce per maund of 80 lbs. were \u2014rice, forming the food of the better class, 9s. 4\u00bdd. to 5s. 8\u00bdd., according to quality; harik, food of the poorest class, 1s. 10\u00bed.; nagli or ragi, 5s.; wari, 4s. 1\u00bdd.; dal (split-peas), 7s.; salt, 5s. 10\u00bed.; gh\u00ee, \u00a33, 3s. The average wages per day of skilled labour were 1s. 2\u00bdd.; of unskilled labour, 5\u00bcd. The day's hire for a cart was 1s. 2d. The agricultural stock and implements were\u2014cows, bullocks, and buffaloes, 363,847; horses, 295; donkeys, 2; sheep and goats, 38,230; ploughs, 88,743; carts\u2014riding, 175, and carrying, 1,277.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014Since the beginning of British rule there has been no year of distress so severe and general as to amount to famine. Of only two of the older famines, those of 1790 and 1802-03, does any information remain. Both of these seem to have been felt all over the District. In 1824, a very light rainfall was followed by a complete failure of crops in high grounds, and a partial failure in low rice lands. In 1876, an insufficient rainfall caused a serious loss of crops and local distress, but not actual famine. Public health was bad, and there was considerable distress. A total of \u00a37736 was spent on relief works. An unusual demand for labour sprang up in and near Bombay city; and it was estimated that at least 150,000 (double the usual number) of the poor workers moved to Bombay for part of the fair season, and returned with savings enough to last them till the next harvest.\n\nTrade, etc.\u2014From beyond the line of the Sahy\u00e2dr\u00ees, grain, cotton, and sugar are brought down to the sea-coast for exportation, and the carts and bullocks thus engaged generally take back cocoa-nuts, salt, and dried fish. Steamers from Bombay call regularly at the ports in the fair season, bringing piece-goods and stores, and taking back cotton from Vengurla and Ratn\u00e1giri. The local shipping traffic has suffered through the competition of steamers; but a large traffic is still carried on by this means with the Malabar coast, Cutch, K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, and Kar\u00e1ch\u00ed. In 1883-84, the number of vessels which entered and cleared the ports of the District was 33,328, of 959,737 tonnage; of these, 444 were steamers, of 579,194 tonnage.\n\nThe Ratn\u00e1giri seaboard contains 29 ports and harbours. They are of two classes\u2014coast ports on sheltered bays and river mouths; and inland ports up tidal creeks, generally at the point where navigation ceases. Of the whole, nine, B\u00e1nkot, Harnai, Chiplun, Sangameshwar, Ratn\u00e1giri, R\u00e1j\u00e1pur, Kh\u00e1rep\u00e1tan, M\u00e1lw\u00e1n, and Vengurla, are places of some trade and consequence; the rest are insignificant. The ports are grouped for customs purposes into six divisions\u2014Anjanwel, M\u00e1lw\u00e1n, Ratn\u00e1giri, Suvarndrug, Vengurla, and Vijiadrug. The total value of\nthe sea-borne trade of the ports in the District amounted in 1876 to \u00a32,410,611, of which \u00a31,004,547 represented the exports, and \u00a31,406,064 the imports; and in 1883-84 to \u00a32,601,301\u2014exports \u00a31,467,390, and imports \u00a31,133,911. The manufactures of the District are unimportant; but the School of Industry at Ratn\u00e1giri town possesses steam sawmills, and undertakes wood and iron work of all descriptions.\n\nIn 1852, Captain (now Sir George) Wingate wrote: 'There are not even bullock-paths from many villages to the nearest market towns, and the whole of the produce sent there for sale is taken upon men's heads. Carts are unknown. Of late years, however, many improvements have been made. Three good cart-roads now cross the Sahy\u00e1dri Hills, and also a trunk road, with branches from one end of the District to the other. During the famine of 1876-77, nearly 90,000 tons of grain passed inland from the coast. There are at present 763 miles of road in the District.\n\nAdministration.\u2014In 1819, the South Konkan was formed into a separate District, with B\u00e1nkot as its head-quarters, which in the next year were removed to Ratn\u00e1giri, a more central and convenient place. In 1830, the three t\u00e1luks north of B\u00e1nkot were transferred to the North Konkan, and Ratn\u00e1giri reduced to the rank of a Sub-collectorate. But in 1832 it was again made a District. The total revenue in 1883-84 under all heads, imperial, local, and municipal, amounted to \u00a3135,088; the incidence of taxation per head being 2s. 7\u00bdd. The land-tax forms the principal source of income, yielding \u00a391,429. The local funds, created since 1863, yielded a total of \u00a35306. There are five municipalities, containing an aggregate population of 43,728 persons. The municipalities are Ratn\u00e1giri, Chiplun, Vengurla, R\u00e1j\u00e1pur, and D\u00e1poli. The native members of the committees numbered in all 72, and the European members 15. The receipts of the municipalities were returned at \u00a38431, and the incidence of taxation varied from 5\u00bdd. (D\u00e1poli) to 3s. 5\u00bdd. (Vengurla) per head of population. The form of taxation known as octroi, levied upon commodities brought within municipal limits, furnished an income of \u00a32275. The District is administered by a Collector and 6 Assistants. It is provided with a District Judge's court, and 8 civil courts. The total strength of the regular police in 1883-84 consisted of 737 officers and men, giving 1 policeman to every 1354 of the population and to every 5 square miles of the area. The total cost was \u00a310,514, equal to \u00a32, 13s. 7\u00bdd. per square mile and 2\u00bdd. per head of population. The District contains one jail; daily average number of prisoners in 1880, 312, of whom 16 were women.\n\nEducation has widely spread of late years. In 1855-56 there were only 20 schools, attended by 2403 pupils. In 1876-77 there were 147 schools, with 8776 pupils. In 1883-84 the number of schools was 155, and the number of scholars 12,014, the average being 1\nschool to every 8 villages. The Census of 1881 returned 14,104 boys and 215 girls as under instruction, besides 29,889 males and 224 females able to read and write, but not under instruction. Four newspapers were published in 1876\u201377, and six in 1883\u201384.\n\nClimate.\u2014The climate of the District, though moist and relaxing, is on the whole healthy. The rainfall is abundant and comparatively regular. The annual rainfall during the five years ending 1876 averaged 105 inches; and for about twenty years ending 1881, 107.3 inches. Maximum heat at Ratn\u00e1giri in 1883, 99.9\u00b0 F.; minimum, 58.6\u00b0 F. The prevailing diseases are intermittent fevers and leprosy. There are 4 dispensaries in the District, and a hospital for lepers; in-door patients (1883), 799; out-door, 21,135. Registered birth-rate, 20 per thousand; registered death-rate, 16.7 per thousand. The deaths from cholera in 1883 numbered 91; from small-pox, 904; from fevers, 8235. Total number of persons vaccinated, 25,349.\n\nRatn\u00e1giri.\u2014Sub-division of Ratn\u00e1giri District, Bombay Presidency. Situated in the centre of the District, bounded on the west by the sea. Area, 432 square miles. Population (1881) 126,227, namely, 59,311 males and 66,916 females, occupying 22,504 houses, in 1 town and 149 villages. Hindus numbered 111,056; Muhammadans, 14,939; and \u2018others,\u2019 232. The coast-line is bold, and indented with numerous creeks. Climate moist and relaxing. Alluvial deposits on the banks and at the estuaries of the creeks. The plateaux and hills consist entirely of laterite. In 1877\u201378, 150,538 acres were under tillage. Grain crops occupied 146,285 acres; pulses, 1500 acres; fibres, 125 acres; oil-seeds, 1050 acres; and miscellaneous crops, 1578 acres. In 1883\u201384 the Sub-division contained 1 civil and 2 criminal courts; police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), 5; regular police, 68 men. Land revenue, \u00a35,10,578.\n\nRatn\u00e1giri.\u2014Chief town of Ratn\u00e1giri District, Bombay Presidency; situated in lat. 16\u00b0 59' 37\" N., and long. 73\u00b0 19' 50\" E., 136 miles south by east of Bombay. Population (1872) 10,614; (1881) 12,616, namely, 6418 males and 6198 females. Hindus number 9343; Muhammadans, 3076; Christians, 192; and Jains, 5. The town is open, and faces the sea; the fort stands on a rock between two small bays, but these afford neither shelter nor good anchorage, as they are completely exposed and have a rocky bottom. With any breeze from the west, a heavy surf breaks on the bar, and boats can only enter at high tide. The water-supply is entirely derived from wells, which are for the most part never-failing. One object of interest connected with Ratn\u00e1giri is the t\u00e1rli or sardine fishery, which usually takes place in the months of January and February, when fleets of canoes may be seen engaged in this occupation. A single net-caster will fill his canoe in the course of a morning. The fishing ground is just outside the breakers. The industry can be carried on only when the water is clear enough to\nadmit of the fish being readily seen. The salt-water creek to the south of the fort is only practicable for country craft of under 20 tons burden.\n\nThe chief ports in the Ratn\u00e1giri customs division are Jaigarh, Ratn\u00e1giri, and Purangarh. The average annual value of the trade of the Ratn\u00e1giri customs division for the five years ending 1883-84 is returned at \u00a3128,763, viz. imports \u00a391,029, and exports \u00a337,734. In 1883-84 the value was \u00a3141,824\u2014imports \u00a397,358, and exports \u00a344,466. The chief imports are salt, timber, catechu, and grain; the exports\u2014fuel, fish, and bamboos.\n\nBesides being the head-quarters of the District, Ratn\u00e1giri has a sub-judge\u2019s court, civil and leper hospitals, and four schools. In 1878 it was constituted a municipality. The income is chiefly derived from a house-tax. The streets and the landing-place are lighted; and a travellers\u2019 or staging bungalow is kept up. From a perennial stream two and a half miles east of the town, water has been conducted, and pipes have been laid through all the chief quarters. In 1883-84 the municipal committee was composed of 6 European and 22 native members. The income was \u00a3649; incidence of municipal taxation, 10\u00bdd. per head. The lighthouse was erected in 1867. The elevation of the lantern above high water is 250 feet, and the height of the building, from base to vane, 22 feet. It exhibits a single red, fixed dioptric light, of order 6, which is visible at 8 to 10 miles\u2019 distance.\n\n**Rato Dero.**\u2014T\u00e1luk of L\u00e1rkh\u00e1na Sub-division, Shik\u00e1rpur District, Sind, Bombay Presidency. Area, 228 square miles. Population (1872) 35,896; (1881) 41,588, namely, 22,480 males and 19,108 females, occupying 6023 houses, in 1 town and 86 villages. Hindus number 3379; Muhammadans, 34,517; Sikhs, 3604; and aboriginal tribes, 88. Gross revenue (1882-83), \u00a314,388. Area assessed to land revenue, 43,329 acres; area of actual cultivation, 41,328 acres. The Sub-division contained\u2014criminal courts, 2; police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), 4; regular police, 26 men.\n\n**Rato Dero.**\u2014Chief town of Rato Dero t\u00e1luk, in L\u00e1rkh\u00e1na Sub-division, Shik\u00e1rpur District, Sind, Bombay Presidency; 18 miles northeast by north from L\u00e1rkh\u00e1na. Head-quarters of a mukhtiy\u00e1rk\u00e1r, and tappad\u00e1r, and contains the usual public buildings. Population (1881) 3170. Local trade in grain. Rato Dero was formerly the encampment of a chief of the Jalb\u00e1ni tribe called Rato. Municipal revenue in 1883-84, \u00a3370; incidence of taxation, 1s. 11\u00bdd. per head of population.\n\n**Ratsar** (or **Ratsar Kal\u00e1n**).\u2014Village in Ballia tahsil, Ballia District, North-Western Provinces; situated in lat. 25\u00b0 54' 02\" N., and long. 84\u00b0 05' 07\" E., on the Garw\u00e1r-Sikandarpur road. Population (1881) 4911. The principal village of the Ratsar t\u00e1luk or estate, which was per-\nmanently settled with Karcholi\u00e1 R\u00e1jputs, and is still in the possession of the descendants of the original proprietors. The village contains two sugar factories, and a primary school. A large b\u00e1z\u00e1r is held twice a week.\n\n**Rattihalli.**\u2014Village in the Kod Sub-division of Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r District, Bombay Presidency; situated about 10 miles south-east of Kod. Population (1881) 2332. Till 1864, Rattihalli was the head-quarters of the Sub-division. In 1764, in the war between Haidar Al\u00ed and the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, Rattihalli was the scene of a signal rout of Haidar\u2019s army. A temple in Jakhan\u00e1ch\u00e1rya style, built of sculptured slabs, and with three domes supported on 36 pillars. Seven inscriptions varying in date from 1174 to 1550 A.D. Weekly market on Friday. Ruined fort.\n\n**Rau Karna.**\u2014Town in Unao District, Oudh; situated 7 miles from Unao town, on the road to Safipur. Population (1881) 2200, of whom 46 are Muhammadans. Small market, twice a week.\n\n**Rauk-thwa** (or more correctly Yauk-thwa).\u2014Stream which rises in the Paung-laung range in Taung-g\u00fa District, Tenasserim Division, Lower Burma.\u2014See Yauk-thwa.\n\n**R\u00e1ver.**\u2014Town in the Savda Sub-division of Kh\u00e1ndesh District, Bombay Presidency. Lat. 21\u00b0 15' N., long. 76\u00b0 4' 30\" E. Population (1881) 7482, namely, Hindus, 5698; Muhammadans, 1510; Jains, 189; and \u2018others,\u2019 85. A good road, two miles long and carefully bridged, connects the town with R\u00e1ver station on the north-east line of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, 297 miles north-east of Bombay. R\u00e1ver has a local reputation for its manufactures of gold thread and articles of native apparel. In the main street, leading from the market-place to the fort, the houses are nearly all three-storied, and tiled with richly-carved wooden fronts. R\u00e1ver was ceded by the Niz\u00e1m to the Peshw\u00e1 in 1763, and by the latter bestowed on Holkar\u2019s family. Post-office. Small rest-house at the railway station.\n\n**R\u00e1ver.**\u2014Village in Nim\u00e1r District, Central Provinces; on the Narbad\u00e1 (Nerbudda) river, 40 miles from Khandw\u00e1. Contains the cenotaph of the Peshw\u00e1 B\u00e1j\u00ed R\u00e1o, who died at R\u00e1ver in 1740, when about to invade Northern India for the second time. The monument is built of variegated sandstone, enclosed in a spacious dhaims\u00e1la of strong masonry. A handsome gh\u00e1t, opposite the platform in the centre of the river, where the funeral rites were performed, has been much injured by floods. R\u00e1ver lies a short distance from the Barw\u00e1i or Dhang\u00e1on travellers\u2019 bungalow, and is also accessible from Barw\u00e1i by boat.\n\n**R\u00e1vi.**\u2014River in the Punjab (Panj\u00e1b); one of the five great streams from which the Province derives its name. The *Hydraotes* of Arrian, and the *Iravati* of Sanskrit authors. It rises in the K\u00falu Sub-division of K\u00e1ngra District, and immediately passes into Chamba State,\nafter which it strikes upon British territory again on the borders of Gurdaspur District, opposite Bas\u00e1oli in Jamu, and forms the boundary for 25 miles, with a general south-westerly course. It leaves the hills on the southern bank at Sh\u00e1hpur, but still flows between high cliffs, while on the Jamu side the mountains descend to its very brink. At Madhupur, the head-works of the Bari Doab Canal draw off a large portion of its waters. Thence-forward the banks sink in height, and the river assumes the usual character of the Punjab streams, flowing in the centre of an alluvial valley, with outer banks at some distance from the present bed. In 1810 it carried away the Tali Sahib shrine near Dera N\u00e1nak, a place of great sanctity with the Sikhs, and still threatens the town. The R\u00e1vi next passes between Si\u00e1lkot and Amritsar Districts, preserving the general south-westerly direction which it has taken since leaving the mountains. The depth is here not more than a foot in March and April, swelling in June and September to 18 or 20 feet. Entering the District of Lahore, it runs within 1 mile of Lahore city, and throws out several branches, which soon, however, rejoin the parent stream. A bridge of boats conveys across the Lahore and Peshawar road. After entering Montgomery District it receives its chief tributary, the Degh, on its north-western bank, and then passes into M\u00falt\u00e1n (Mooltan) District. Finally, it falls into the Chen\u00e1b (Chin\u00e1b) in lat. $30^\\circ 31'$ N., long. $71^\\circ 51' 20''$ E., after a total length of about 450 miles.\n\nThroughout its course in the plains, the R\u00e1vi flows everywhere in a comparatively narrow valley, often only a couple of miles in width, with generally a very tortuous channel. In one part, however, the river runs a perfectly straight course for 12 miles from Kuchlumba to Sar\u00e1i Sidhu in M\u00falt\u00e1n District, between high wooded banks, forming a beautiful reach. Few islands are formed, but the bed shifts occasionally from place to place. The floods of the R\u00e1vi only fertilize a fringe of 1 or 2 miles on either side; and it is little employed for direct irrigation, although it supplies water both to the Bari Doab and H\u00e1sli Canals. Navigation is difficult, but grain is shipped from Lahore in considerable quantities. Deod\u00e1r timber, floated down in rafts from the Chamba forests, only finds its way to Lahore in seasons of heavy flood. In former times the R\u00e1vi did not join the Chen\u00e1b until a point below M\u00falt\u00e1n city, and its ancient bed may still be traced. Even now, at times of high flood, the water finds its way to M\u00falt\u00e1n by the old channel.\n\nR\u00e1wal Pindi.\u2014Division or Commissionership under the jurisdiction of the Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab, lying between $31^\\circ 32'$ and $34^\\circ$ N. lat., and between $71^\\circ 37'$ and $74^\\circ 31'$ E. long. The Division, which includes an area of 15,435 square miles, comprises the four\nDistricts of Rawal Pindi, Jehlam (Jhelum), Gujrat, and Shahpur, all of which see separately. Bounded on the north by Haz\u00e1ra and Pesh\u00e1war Districts; on the east by the Native State of Kashmir; on the south by Jhang, Gujr\u00e1nw\u00e1la, and Si\u00e1lkot Districts; and on the west by Koh\u00e1t, Bannu, and Dera Ism\u00e1il Kh\u00e1n Districts.\n\nThe population of Rawal Pindi Division was returned by the Census of 1868 at 2,197,041. The last enumeration in 1881 disclosed a population of 2,520,508, showing an increase of 323,467 in thirteen years. The results of the Census of 1881 may be summarized as follows:\u2014Area of the Division, 15,435 square miles, with 24 towns and 4570 villages; number of houses, 329,573; number of families, 541,822. Total population, 2,520,508, namely, males 1,346,573, and females 1,173,935; proportion of males, 53\u00b74 per cent. Average density of population, 163 persons per square mile, varying from 349 per square mile in Gujr\u00e1t to 90 per square mile in Sh\u00e1hpur. Average number of persons per town or village, 549; inmates per house, 7\u00b765. Classified according to sex and age, the Census shows\u2014under 15 years of age, males 544,743, and females 475,962; total children, 1,020,705, or 40\u00b75 per cent. of the population: 15 years and upwards, males 801,830, and females 697,973; total adults, 1,499,803, or 59\u00b75 per cent.\n\nReligion.\u2014As regards religious distinctions, Muhammadans form the great majority of the population, numbering 2,193,558, or 87 per cent. Hindus are returned at 278,587, or 11\u00b70 per cent.; Sikhs, 42,555, or 1\u00b76 per cent.; Christians, 4522; Jains, 1100; and Parsis and \u2018others,\u2019 186. Among the ethnical divisions, the J\u00e1ts come first, numbering 352,914. Of these, only 7769, or 2\u00b72 per cent., still retain the ancestral creed of their Hindu or Sikh forefathers; the remainder are the descendants of converts who embraced Isl\u00e1m during the earlier Muhammadan invasions. R\u00e1jputs number 303,131, of whom all except 2563 are returned as Muhammadans by religion. The Muhammadan population by race, as distinguished from descendants of converts, consists of\u2014Sayyids, 60,138; Shaikhs, 49,341; Path\u00e1ns, 46,192; Mughals, 44,016; Kashmiris, 66,937; and Bal\u00fach\u00eds, 13,497.

The other principal castes and tribes, almost all Muhammadans by religion, with a sprinkling of Hindus and Sikhs, include\u2014Aw\u00e1ns, 279,204; G\u00fajars, 138,655; Chuhras, 113,601; Jul\u00e1has, 111,963; Moch\u00eds, 90,004; Tar-kh\u00e1ns, 69,372; Moniars, 53,115; Kumbh\u00e1rs, 52,869; Arains, 44,432; N\u00e1is, 43,659; Loh\u00e1rs, 40,214; Machh\u00eds, 32,347; Tel\u00eds, 31,360; Mir\u00e1s\u00eds, 30,077; Charho\u00e1s, 29,053; Dhob\u00eds, 25,735; Son\u00e1rs, 21,372 (including 18,143 Hindus); Ghakkars, 20,776; Jhinw\u00e1rs, 17,363;\nKhokhars, 12,841; Darz\u00eds, 10,244; and Khoj\u00e1s, 7658. The Christian population consists of Europeans, 4128; Eurasiens, 214; and natives of India, 180.\n\nTown and Rural Population.\u2014R\u00e1wal Pindi Division contains six towns with a population exceeding ten thousand inhabitants, namely, RAWAL PINDI, 52,975; JEHLM, 21,107; GUJRAT, 18,743; PIND DADAN KHAN, 16,724; BHERA, 15,165; and JALALPUR, 12,839. Besides the foregoing, there are 18 minor towns, with an aggregate of 102,910 inhabitants, bringing up the total urban population to 240,463, or 9.6 per cent. of the population of the Division. There are 20 municipalities, with an aggregate population of 213,403; total municipal income (1883-84), \u00a328,414, or an average of 2s. 8d. per head. Of the 4594 towns and villages in the Division, 1496 are returned as containing less than two hundred inhabitants; 1604 between two and five hundred; 922 from five hundred to a thousand; 423 from one to two thousand; 98 from two to three thousand; 33 from three to five thousand; 12 from five to ten thousand; and 6 upwards of ten thousand inhabitants. As regards occupation, the male population over 15 years of age are thus returned:\u2014(1) Professional class, including civil and military, 39,293; (2) domestic class, 25,423; (3) commercial class, including bankers, merchants, traders, and carriers, 28,437; (4) agricultural and pastoral class, including gardeners, 420,369; (5) industrial and manufacturing class, including gardeners, 184,705; (6) indefinite and non-productive class, including general labourers, 67,195; and (7) unspecified class, 36,408.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014According to the Punjab Administration Report for 1883-84, out of a total assessed area of 15,308 square miles, or 9,796,992 acres, 3,518,493 acres were under cultivation in that year; 1,246,287 acres were returned as grazing land; 2,011,847 acres were cultivable, but not under tillage; and 3,020,366 acres were uncultivable waste. Of the cultivated area, 660,086 acres were artificially irrigated, namely, 62,407 acres from Government works, and 597,679 acres by private individuals from wells, etc. The great crop of the Division is wheat, which is grown on 1,362,339 acres; followed by bajra, 792,889 acres; jo\u00e1r, 175,823 acres; barley, 136,617 acres; gram, 95,347 acres; Indian corn, 79,948 acres; and pulses, 190,331 acres. Rice is grown on only 8309 acres. Cotton occupies 82,045 acres; sugar-cane, 9737 acres; and tobacco, 6474 acres.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The administrative staff of the R\u00e1wal Pindi Division consists of a Commissioner of Division, who is directly responsible to the Lieutenant-Governor of the Province, with an additional Judicial Commissioner; 4 Deputy Commissioners, each with a Judicial Assistant; a Cantonment Magistrate, and ordinarily 10 Assistant and extra-Assistant Commissioners, 17 tahsild\u00e1rs, 12 muns\u00edfs, and\n9 honorary magistrates, besides a staff of subordinate village officials, and the usual police, medical, and public works officials. The gross revenue of the Division in 1883-84 amounted to \u00a3329,160, of which \u00a3238,070 was derived from the land. Protection to person and property is afforded by 53 civil and revenue courts, and 41 criminal courts, with a regular police force of 2370 officers and men, stationed at 62 police circles, besides a village watch or rural police of 2682 chaukidirs. There are altogether 8 jails and Sub-divisional lock-ups, with an average daily prison population in 1883 of 1505, of whom 1395 were labouring convicts. Means of communication are afforded by 301 miles of the Punjab Northern State Railway, with its branches to Kushalgurh, and to the Salt Mines; by 224 miles of metalled and 3752 miles of unmetalled roads; and by 407 miles of navigable rivers.\n\nThere are 247 Government and aided schools in the Division, attended by 20,952 pupils in 1883-84. This is exclusive of uninspected indigenous village schools; and the Census of 1881 returned 22,853 boys and 875 girls as under instruction, besides 59,734 males and 1160 females able to read and write, but not under instruction.\n\nMedical relief is furnished by 36 hospitals and dispensaries, attended in 1883-84 by 4540 in-door and 284,189 out-door patients. Total number of deaths registered in the Division in 1883-84, 64,701, showing a death-rate of 25\u00b76 per thousand.\n\nR\u00e1wal Pindi.\u2014District in the Lieutenant-Governorship of the Punjab, lying between 33\u00b0 3' and 34\u00b0 4' N. lat., and between 71\u00b0 46' and 73\u00b0 41' E. long.; with an area of 4861 square miles, and a population in 1881 of 820,512 souls. It forms the most northern of the four Districts of the R\u00e1wal Pindi Division, and occupies the table-land between the Salt Range, the outer Him\u00e1layas, and the Indus. Bounded on the north by Haz\u00e1ra District; on the east by the river Jehlam (Jhelum); on the south by Jehlam (Jhelum) District; and on the west by the river Indus, which separates it from Pesh\u00e1war and Koh\u00e1t Districts. R\u00e1wal Pindi stands sixth in order of area, and seventh in order of population, among the 32 Districts of the Punjab, comprising 4\u00b756 per cent. of the total area, and 4\u00b736 per cent. of the total population of the Province. It is divided into seven tahr\u00eds, of which Pindi Gheb lies in the south-west; Attock in the north-west; Fatehjang in the south centre; G\u00fajar Kh\u00e1n in the south-east; and R\u00e1wal Pindi in the north-east; with Kah\u00fata tahsil in the extreme east, and the small tahsil of Marri (Murree) in the extreme north-eastern corner. The administrative head-quarters of the District and Division are at the town of RAWAL PINDI.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The District of R\u00e1wal Pindi forms a portion of the rugged and broken Him\u00e1layan spur which projects irregularly into the northern angle of the Sind S\u00e1g\u00e1r Do\u00e1b. Its surface is cut up in\nevery direction by mountain ranges entering it from either side, while\nthe intermediate valleys are intersected by minor heights, whose con-\nfused and irregular masses crop out in picturesque diversity, to the\ndespair of the systematic geographer. So far as these fantastic bosses\ncan be reduced to any order, they naturally divide themselves into two\ncharacteristic regions, on the east and west of an imaginary central line.\nThe eastern range, running along the side of the Jehlam (Jhelum) river,\nis known by the name of the Murree (Marri) Hills, from the sanitarium\nperched upon its northern extremity. It is composed of sandstone slopes,\nthe direct outliers of the Him\u00e1layas, and is clothed with magnificent forest\ntrees and a rich undergrowth of brushwood. Near the summer station\nof Murree (Marri), the spur attains a height of 8000 feet, and stretching\nthence into the District of Haz\u00e1ra, loses itself at last in the snowy\nranges of Kashmir. The view from the sanitarium embraces the white\ncloud-like summits of the Kashmir Mountains, with a rich and varied\nforeground of mingled forest and cultivation clothing the hill-sides.\nSouthward, the hills decrease in height, growing more diversified and\nangular, but gaining in picturesqueness what they lose in sublimity.\nCottages appear on every jutting ledge, half hidden amid the foliage,\novertopped by a graceful mosque, and threatened from above by some\nfrowning fortress of Sikh or Ghakkar chieftain. At length, on the\nsouthern frontier, the hills slowly subside into a comparatively level\ncountry, only divided from the valley of the Jehlam by a narrow barrier\nof sandstone.\n\nThe western half of the District presents a very different appearance.\nIts mountains belong to the trans-Indus system, which is here severed\nby the deeply cut channel of the great river, so as to give off a series\nof isolated ridges, cutting up the opposite bank into wild mazes or\nlimestone hills. The soil here is dry and barren; the vegetation is\nscanty and stunted; the valleys are mere water-worn ravines or beds of\nflooded torrents; and the population is crowded into large villages,\nwhich lie scattered at great distances among the inhospitable rocks.\nThe chief range of these western mountains is known as the Chitta\nPah\u00e1r, from the whiteness of its exposed nummulitic beds. To the\nnorth lies the fertile valley of Chach, one of the rare oases which\nrelieve the wildness of this savage waste. A minor range ends in the\nblack cliffs of Attock, an important ferry and fortress on the Indus.\nSmaller lines of hills cover the remainder of the area, in too great\nnumbers for special description.\n\nOf the rivers of R\u00e1wal Pindi, the Indus claims first rank. It\nbounds the District along its whole western edge. After entering in a\nnarrow channel from Haz\u00e1ra, it suddenly expands to a breadth of more\nthan a mile, dividing the fertile plains of Chach and Yusafzai, and\nembracing many wooded islets in its placid stream. At Attock it\ncontracts once more, as it rushes under the dark rocks of Jal\u00e1l\u00eda and Kam\u00e1l\u00eda; while below, it again becomes a broad lake at B\u00e1gh N\u00edl\u00e1b, and yet again narrows to pass through the beetling gorge of the Mokhad Hills. At Mokhad it becomes navigable for steamers, and immediately passes beyond the borders of R\u00e1wal Pindi. In 1884, an iron-girder railway bridge across the Indus, with a sub-way for ordinary traffic, was completed at a point about three miles south of Attock fort. The Indus does not at present afford any facilities for irrigation, but were a canal cut through the Chach plain, it is believed that a considerable area might be thus watered. The average depth of the Indus at Attock is 17 feet in the winter and 50 feet in the summer. Its average fall between Attock and K\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1gh (in Bannu) is 20 inches per mile.\n\nThe Jehlam (Jhelum) on the eastern frontier (the Hydaspes of Greek and Roman writers) is equally picturesque, though less important for navigation. It rises in Kashm\u00edr, and passing through the Bara M\u00fal\u00e1 Pass, skirts R\u00e1wal Pindi District from its northernmost point to its southern boundary, a distance of about 70 miles. It flows, throughout, between lofty mountains and precipitous rocks, with a clear and swift stream, but interrupted by numerous rapids, which render it incapable of navigation above Dangalli. Timber, however, is floated down in large quantities from Kashm\u00edr. Below Dangalli, 40 miles east of R\u00e1wal Pindi town, the river becomes navigable. A good mule road has been recently made along the right bank of the Jehlam at an average elevation of 100 feet above the river, bringing the town of Jehlam into direct communication with the new suspension bridge on the Murree and Kashm\u00edr road at Koh\u00e1la. The Jehlam forms no islands in R\u00e1wal Pindi District, nor is it used for irrigation, its steep and rocky sides forming an insurmountable obstacle even to the smallest cuts.\n\nThe next river in importance is the Soh\u00e1n, which receives the drainage of the central portion of the District. Taking its rise within a few miles of Murree, it flows down deep valleys for the first 10 miles of its course, till it reaches the plains near the old ruined fortress of the Ghakkars at Pharw\u00e1la, whence it takes a south-westerly course throughout the entire length of the District. It is crossed by a fine bridge 3 miles to the east of R\u00e1wal Pindi town, and finally joins the Indus 10 miles below Mokhad. The bed of the river is for the most part sandy, with an occasional mixture of stiff clay, except in the upper portion, where it is composed of large boulders and rocks. Quicksands are numerous, and often dangerous, in the lower parts. No ferries are maintained on the Soh\u00e1n, and the river is fordable at all seasons, except after heavy floods. Its waters are diverted to a small extent for mills, and to irrigate low-lying lands; but its violent\nfloods are an insuperable obstacle to the erection of any works of a permanent character.\n\nThe only other river requiring notice is the Haroh, which flows in the same direction as the Soh\u00e1n, but more to the westward. Debouching from the Haz\u00e1ra hills near Kh\u00e1npur, it takes a westerly course towards the Gandgarh hills, passing 9 miles north of Hasan Abd\u00e1l, and eventually falls into the Indus, 12 miles below Attock. Numerous small cuts afford irrigation to a large tract of country in the neighbourhood of Usm\u00e1n Khatar and Hasan Abd\u00e1l. The stream also affords motive power to several flour mills.\n\nForests.\u2014The forests of R\u00e1wal Pindi consist of two divisions, namely, the hill forests of Murree and Kah\u00fata tahsil, and the rakhs or Government reserves which were found to be without owners at the time of settlement, and were accordingly marked out as Government wastes. These rakhs are situated in the plains portion of the District, in tahsils R\u00e1wal Pindi, Fatehjang, Attock, and Pindi Gheb.\n\nThe hill forests are characterized by pine and oak as the chief products. In the extreme north of Murree tahsil, Pinus excelsa, Quercus dilatata and incana, together with Populus alba and ciliata, Cedrela Toona, Ulmus Wallichiana, Celtis australis, Acer villosum and pictum, \u00c6sculus indica, are found in the higher forests; while south of Murree grow Pinus longifolia and Quercus incana with some Annulata, Pyrus foliolosa, Cornus macrophylla, Acacia Catechu; and descending lower, Acacia modesta, Pistacia integerrima, Zizyphus Jujuba, Eugenia Jambolana, Dalbergia Sissoo, Olea cuspidata, etc. The lower Kah\u00fata forests present the curious mixture of Pinus longifolia and Dodonea viscosa, with hardly any other tree or bush. The pine forests (longifolia) are very liable to destructive fires, often lit by villagers with the intent of burning off the thick layers of pine needles which destroy the grass. The chief brushwood plants are Indigofera heterantha, Berberis aristata, Carissa diffusa. The pine (chil) is largely used for building, while the oak, acacia, olive, and other hard woods are utilised in large quantities for fuel. Hitherto the Government and villagers have had a kind of partnership, the former claiming all trees of spontaneous growth, while the latter have liberty to graze their cattle everywhere they please, and to cut wood for domestic purposes without restriction. Trees for building are granted free on application to tahsild\u00e1rs. The sale only is prohibited.\n\nThe reserves on the plains (rakhs), nine in number, with a total area of 66,971 acres, consist, with one exception, of hills standing out from the surrounding country. The largest of these, Margalla, with an area of 24,362 acres, is the south side of the range where the Haz\u00e1ra Hills come abruptly to an end. Its highest point is 5200 feet; from 3500 feet upwards pine occurs, but below this the vegetation is the same as\nelsewhere in the plains' reserves, namely, Acacia modesta, Acacia Catechu, and Olea ferruginea. Peculiar to Margalla are Mallotus philippinensis, which forms occasionally dense thickets; also Buxus sempervirens or the boxwood tree. Of brushwood, there are Dodon\u00e6a, Justicia adhatoda, Prinsepia utilis, Celastrus spinosus, Carissa diffusa, etc. Dodon\u00e6a burns well when green, and is a good roofing material, as white ants do not eat it.\n\nOf a total area of 649 square miles in R\u00e1wal Pindi District under the Forest Department in 1882, 104 square miles were 'reserved' forest (rakhs), and 171 square miles 'protected' hill forest, while 374 square miles were unreserved. A few wild products are obtained in the forests, but in such small quantities as hardly to deserve the name of market articles: flower buds of the kachn\u00e1r, used as food and for pickles; wild pomegranate seeds for medicinal purposes; fir oil (from the trees); gum, honey, and wax; and various small fruits, such as blackberries, raspberries, sloes, cranberries, and wild pears. The only people who live by pasturing cattle in the forests are G\u00fajars, who, to the number of about 200, bring down large flocks of goats and sheep from K\u00e1g\u00e1n and the distant mountains to graze during the winter months in the more genial climate of Murree and the adjacent hills. With the approach of summer they retire to the higher ranges.\n\nMinerals.\u2014R\u00e1wal Pindi is not rich in minerals. A beautiful veined marble (abri) is found in Kawagarh hill, and can be worked into cups; but the cost is high, owing to the hardness of the stone and the scarcity of skilled labour. A sulphur mine, formerly worked by the Sikhs, exists at Zohra village, north-east of R\u00e1wal Pindi town. Petroleum is found in small quantities at Ratta Hotar, near the same locality, 13 miles from R\u00e1wal Pindi town, and also at Sadkal on the road from Fatehjang to Campbellpur. In 1882, two wells and seven borings yielded 5000 gallons of oil. Gypsum is found in considerable quantities along the southern part of the hills, but is not utilized. Lignite is occasionally met with in small quantities in the hills, and an inferior description of anthracite is found in small quantities in Pindi Gheb tahsil, near the banks of the Indus. Quite recently, true coal has been discovered in several villages, and has been worked by the Punjab Northern State Railway. It has only been found in or near the surface, in wedge-shaped pockets which gradually taper out and disappear in shale. Gold-washing is carried on in the sands of the Indus and several of its tributaries. The gold-washers earn but a precarious livelihood, estimated to average about the wages of a common day-labourer.\n\nWild Animals.\u2014Tigers, which were numerous thirty years ago, are now almost extinct. Leopards are, however, still common in the hills, and wolves, hyenas, jackals, and foxes are found all over the District.\nBarking deer, ravine deer, and urial are found in the more secluded and inaccessible tracts. Small game are scanty. Hares are found in all the low hills and in most ravines and sparsely cultivated tracts; four kinds of partridges are met with, but not plentifully. There are a few pheasants and jungle fowl near Murree. Among migratory birds are ob\u00e1ra, sand-grouse, duck, snipe, geese, coulon, and quail. Good mahasir fish are to be caught in the Indus, and in the Soh\u00e1n, Haro, and Kurang streams. Fishing as a sole means of livelihood is nowhere practised except on the Indus. The poisonous varieties of serpents are scarce, and deaths from snake-bite are rare. Hawking is a favourite pastime with natives. Several leading chiefs and native gentlemen keep a large number of hawks, and an establishment of trained falconers.\n\nHistory.\u2014Few Districts in India can claim so long a period of authentic history as R\u00e1wal Pindi; for although it does not share in the mythical glories of the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata, it contains many of the towns connected with the great events of Alexander\u2019s Punjab campaign, and is accordingly enshrined in the pages of Arrian and Pliny. Its earliest inhabitants appear to have been the Takkas, a Turanian race who held the greater part of the Sind S\u00e1g\u00e1r Do\u00e1b, and gave their name to the town of Taksh\u00e1sila (the Tax\u00edla of Greek geographers). Alexander found it \u2018a rich and populous city, the largest between the Indus and Hydaspes;\u2019 and its site has been identified in the ruins of Deri Shah\u00e1n or Shah Deri, which lie to the north of the Margala Pass in this District. Fifty years after Alexander\u2019s invasion, the people of Taxila were subject to the King of Magadha; and a rebellion on their part was put down by Prince Asoka, afterwards the famous Buddhist Emperor of Upper India. The notes of the two great Buddhist pilgrims from China during the middle ages show us that Taxila remained a place of peculiar sanctity until the period of Muhammadan conquest. Many relics of ancient temples are still to be found in the District, and legend connects their sites in several cases with important events in the life of Buddha.\n\nWhen the Musalm\u00e1n invasions first draw the veil which hangs over Indian history from the era of Alexander down to the 11th century, we find the country around Taxila in possession of the Ghakkars, a tribe who are described by Ferishta as mere savages, addicted to the grossest forms of polyandry and infanticide. In 1008, Mahm\u00fad of Ghazn\u00ed was met on the plains of Chach by the forces of the R\u00e1jput confederacy under Prithwi R\u00e1j\u00e1, and his victory was almost averted through the impetuous attack of 30,000 Ghakkars. But the battle ended in the total defeat of the R\u00e1jputs, and all Upper India lay helpless at the feet of the Musalm\u00e1n conqueror. Mahm\u00fad, however, appears to have left the Ghakkars in quiet possession of their mountain home,\nand to have pressed on to the occupation of more fertile regions. The Ghakkars are next heard of in 1205, when the reverses of Shah\u00e1b-ud-d\u00edn Ghori in Kharizm encouraged them to rise in revolt against their Muhammadan suzerain, and to ravage the Punjab up to the very gates of Lahore. But the Sult\u00e1n returned unexpectedly to India, defeated the rebellious Ghakkars with great slaughter, and compelled them to embrace the faith of Isl\u00e1m. Shah\u00e1b-ud-d\u00edn did not live to profit by their conversion; for on his way home to his western dominions he was surprised on the farther bank of the Indus by a Ghakkar detachment, who swam the river and murdered him at night in his tent. Under subsequent rulers, the country maintained its character for turbulence, being always ready for revolt whenever the misfortunes of the reigning prince afforded a favourable opportunity.\n\nB\u00e1bar attacked the Ghakkar capital of Pharw\u00e1l\u00e1, and he gives an interesting account of its capture in his autobiography. It was strongly situated in the hills, and was defended with great bravery by its chief H\u00e1ti Kh\u00e1n, who escaped from one gate as the Mughal army marched in at the other. H\u00e1ti Kh\u00e1n died by poison in 1525; and his cousin and murderer, Sult\u00e1n S\u00e1rang, made submission to B\u00e1bar, who conferred upon him in return the Putw\u00e1r country. Thenceforth the Ghakkar chieftains became firm allies of the Mughal dynasty, whom they were able to aid efficiently in their struggle with the house of Sher Sh\u00e1h. During the flourishing period of the Delhi Empire, the family of S\u00e1rang retained their territorial possessions and high social status in the Punjab; but with the decay of the central power they fell a prey, like so many of their neighbours, to the aggressive rule of the Sikh confederacy.\n\nIn 1765, during the total paralysis of the Mughal government, Sard\u00e1r G\u00fajar Singh Bhangi, a powerful Sikh chieftain, marched from Lahore against the last independent Ghakkar prince, Mukarrab Kh\u00e1n, whom he defeated outside the walls of Gujr\u00e1t. Mukarrab retired beyond the Jehlam, where he was soon treacherously murdered by his own tribesmen; but the traitors forthwith quarrelled over their spoil, and fell one by one before Sard\u00e1r G\u00fajar Singh. The Sikhs ruled R\u00e1wal Pindi with their usual rapacity, exacting as revenue the last coin that could be wrung from the proprietors, who were often glad to admit their tenants as joint-sharers, in order to lighten the incidence of the revenue. G\u00fajar Singh held the District throughout his life, and left it on his death to his son, S\u00e1hib Singh, who fell in 1810 before the power of the great Ranj\u00edt Singh. Another Sikh Sard\u00e1r, Milka Singh, fixed upon the site of R\u00e1wal Pindi town, then occupied by an insignificant village, for his headquarters. In spite of Afgh\u00e1n inroads, and the resistance of the Ghakkars, he soon conquered on his own account a tract of country round R\u00e1wal Pindi worth three l\u00e1khs of\nrupees (\u00a330,000). He died in 1804, and his estates were confirmed to his son, Jiun Singh, by Ranjit Singh, until 1814, when, upon Jiun Singh's death, they were annexed to the general territory of Lahore. The Murree (Marri) and other hills long retained their independence under their Ghakkar chieftains; but in 1830 the Sikhs succeeded in reducing them after a bloody struggle, by which the population was almost decimated, and the country reduced to a desert.\n\nIn 1849, Rawal Pindi passed with the rest of the Sikh dominions under British rule; and though tranquillity was disturbed by an insurrection four years later, its administration was generally peaceful until the outbreak of the Mutiny in 1857. The long anarchy and internecine strife of Sikh and Ghakkar could not be forgotten, especially in a wild and lonely region, where British organization extends with difficulty to the remote gorges and scattered hamlets of a rocky labyrinth. The events of 1857 offered an outlet for the smouldering passions of ancestral feud, and the Murree (Marri) Hills became the scene of an attempted insurrection. The authorities received information from a faithful native of a projected attack upon the station, in time to concert measures for defence. The ladies, who were present in large numbers, were placed in safety; the Europeans and police were drawn up in a cordon around the station; and when the enemy arrived, expecting no resistance, they met with a hot reception, which caused them to withdraw in disorder, and shortly after to disband themselves. The District has since experienced no serious commotion; but crimes of violence are frequent.\n\nPopulation.\u2014In a District so extensive and so rugged as Rawal Pindi, it is naturally difficult to conduct an enumeration of the people with minute accuracy, and there are grounds for doubting the correctness of all statistics prior to the Census of 1868. An enumeration in 1855 returned the total population as 553,750. In 1868, the total number was ascertained to be 711,256, showing an increase for the thirteen years of 157,506 persons, or 28 per cent. Though the long period of peace and prosperity which Rawal Pindi has enjoyed since the British occupation would suffice to account for a large augmentation of numbers, a considerable part of this apparent increase must be set down to under-enumeration in 1855. The last enumeration in 1881 returned the population at 820,512, showing a still further increase of 109,256, or 15.3 per cent., in the thirteen years since 1868. This increase, although largely due to the natural excess of births over deaths, is also in great part owing to immigration caused by the extraordinary demand for labour in connection with the Punjab Northern State Railway, and transport arrangements for the Kabul campaign.\n\nThe general results of the Census of 1881 may be summarized\nas follows:\u2014Area of District, 4861 square miles; towns 8, and villages 1639; number of houses, 124,896, namely, occupied 102,283, and unoccupied 22,613; number of families, 162,052. Total population, 820,512, namely, males 449,287, and females 371,225. The high proportion of males, 54.7 per cent., is due to the large immigration of labourers from other Districts, leaving their wives and families at home, and also to the considerable military element. Average density of population, 169 persons per square mile, varying from 68 per square mile in Pindi Gheb, to 275 per square mile in R\u00e1wal Pindi tahsil. Number of towns or villages per square mile, 0.34; persons per town or village, 498; houses per square mile, 26; persons per house, 8.02. Classified according to sex and age, the Census thus returns the population\u2014under 15 years, males 176,126, and females 150,820; total children, 326,946, or 39.8 per cent. of the population: 15 years and upwards, males 273,161, and females 220,405; total adults, 493,566, or 60.2 per cent.\n\nReligion.\u2014In religion, R\u00e1wal Pindi is a stronghold of Muhammadanism, as many as 711,546, or 86.96 per cent. of the inhabitants, being returned as adherents of Isl\u00e1m. The Hindus are scantily represented by 86,162 persons, or 10.50 per cent. of the inhabitants; while the once dominant Sikhs number no more than 17,780 persons, or 2.16 per cent. The remainder consist of\u2014Christians, 3822; Jains, 1033; and P\u00e1rs\u00eds, 169. As regards the ethnical divisions of the people, the Br\u00e1hmans of R\u00e1wal Pindi number 18,523 persons; but in this extreme northern corner, surrounded by an overwhelming Musalm\u00e1n element, and engaged in commerce or agriculture, the Br\u00e1hmans find little scope for their priestly character, and indulge in many practices which would scandalize their stricter brethren in the south. Yet they are quite as minutely sub-divided as elsewhere into minor clans, each of which has its acknowledged rank in the social scale, and refuses to eat or intermarry with the inferior classes. The R\u00e1jputs are the strongest body numerically, having a total of 145,536 souls: their customs, however, require no special notice, and they are almost exclusively Muhammadans in creed. The principal trading classes are the Khattris (41,135) and the Aror\u00e1s (12,181), both retaining the old Hindu faith, and, with their co-religionists the Br\u00e1hmans, monopolizing the commerce of the District. They replace the Baniy\u00e1s of Hindust\u00e1n proper, and are considered quite their equals in rapacity and cunning. The J\u00e1ts number 47,935, almost all Muhammadans, and keep up their usual reputation as careful and industrious agriculturists. In the eastern half of the District they form the principal labouring population. The Ghakkars, whose history has been already detailed, now amount to only 10,667 persons. They are a fine and spirited race, gentlemen in ancestry and bearing, and clinging under all reverses to the traditions\nof noble blood. Though reduced to poverty in many cases by the Sikhs, they are still respected in the District as a native aristocracy, and would come to the front, for good or for evil, in any period of general disturbance.\n\nThe Muhammadan population by race, as distinguished from descendants of converts, consists of\u2014Path\u00e1ns, 36,465; Shaikhs, 25,524; Mughals, 25,169; and Sayyids, 20,422. The other tribes and classes are mainly descendants of Hindu converts, but are now almost exclusively Muhammadans by religion, with a slight Hindu or Sikh element. The principal of these tribes are\u2014Aw\u00e1ns, 124,834 in number; Maniars, 41,701; Jul\u00e1has, 37,001; G\u00fajars, 25,403; Kashm\u00edris, 23,803; Tarkhans, 22,450; Chuhras, 22,046; Much\u00eds, 20,385; Kumbh\u00e1rs, 14,668; Tel\u00eds, 12,384; Loh\u00e1rs, 12,236; Nais, 11,996; Jhinwars, 8632; Son\u00e1rs, 6523; Mir\u00e1s\u00eds, 6205; Darz\u00eds, 6109; and Dhob\u00eds, 5751.\n\nTown and Rural Population.\u2014The population of R\u00e1wal Pindi District is almost entirely rural, and the great bulk of the inhabitants are scattered in tiny hamlets over the face of the country. The Census Report returns eight towns, as being civil stations, municipalities, or cantonments. These are\u2014R\u00e1wal Pindi town, population (1881) 52,975; Pindi Gheb, 8583; Hazro, 6533; Fatehjang, 4875; Attock, 4210; Mokhad, 4195; Murree, 2489; and Campbellpur, 1467. The population of Murree during the height of the summer season rises as high as eight thousand. Of the 1647 towns and villages in the District, 621 contain less than two hundred inhabitants; 584 between two hundred and five hundred; 279 between five hundred and a thousand; 121 between one and two thousand; 26 between two and three thousand; 13 between three and five thousand; and 3 upwards of five thousand inhabitants.\n\nMaterial Condition of the People.\u2014The people, as a rule, are well off; the assessment of the land revenue is light, and the profits of the farmer are large. A holding of 15 acres of average land will enable a man to support his family in tolerable comfort. The number of large incomes, however, is not great. The ordinary expenditure of a well-to-do cultivator is estimated as varying from 18s. per month in the western portion of the District to \u00a31, 4s. in the east. For this sum an ordinary family of, say, five persons can live comfortably. A shopkeeper, who has to buy what a cultivator supplies from his own garden-plot, will spend from \u00a31, 4s. per month in the west to \u00a31, 10s. in the east of the District. The lowest sum upon which an adult can support life is 4s. per month in the west, and 5s. per month in the east of the District. The most ordinary social distinction among the people is that of sahu or gentleman, and zam\u00ednd\u00e1r or cultivator: the Ghakkars, R\u00e1jputs, and Sayyids are considered as belonging to the former class; while the J\u00e1ts and Aw\u00e1ns may be looked upon as typifying the latter.\nThe dwellings of the people, even of the better sort, are mostly constructed of unburnt bricks, single-storied, and generally not more than 8 or 10 feet high. Except in the case of some of the Ghakkar gentry, and a few notabilities, a house constructed of burnt brick, and cemented with lime and mortar, is unknown. In the Mokhad hills and other localities, stone cemented with mud and unplastered is much used. In general, however, the houses are plastered with mud and cow-dung, having flat roofs. Across the rafters, the roof is covered with branches and leaves, upon which mud is beaten, well plastered with earth mixed with chopped straw, and above all a cow-dung coating. Glass windows and hinges are unknown; even in the best dwellings the doors revolve in wooden sockets, and are closed with a chain and rough padlock. The interior of the dwelling presents, even among the ordinary class of peasantry, an appearance of great comfort. Although the walls and floors are rough and uneven, they have a light-coloured appearance, from constant hand-rubbing with a mixture of light clay and cow-dung. The furniture ordinarily consists of a few pallets (ch\u00e1rp\u00e1i), some stools, spindles, a grain receptacle, and a box or trunk for clothing, etc. An adjoining shed shelters the cattle and horses, and another the store of fooder. An enclosure, called sahn or vehra, forms a kind of compound; and this, with an adjacent higher one for sheep and goats, built of strong prickly thorns so as to keep out wolves, completes the habitation of one family. In each village are one or more h\u00fajr\u00e1s, or general assembly rooms, where travellers are entertained, and all questions relating to the village or section of the village are discussed. A number of the foregoing clumps of dwellings, massed together, without the slightest regard for symmetry, so as to leave narrow lanes, scarcely wide enough to allow a laden donkey to pass; one or more h\u00fajr\u00e1s; one or two neat mosques, and a clump of trees\u2014the whole planted on a slightly elevated site above the level of the surrounding country\u2014make up a rural village in R\u00e1wal Pindi.\n\nThe ordinary food of the people consists chiefly of b\u00e1jra (spiked millet) during the winter months, and of wheat mixed with barley in the summer. In bad years, the poorer classes content themselves with a kind of pulse, called bhakra, which grows as a trailing creeper in great profusion. Meat, gh\u00ed (clarified butter), d\u00e1l, spices, and vegetables are eaten, when they can be afforded. Ten per cent. of the population drink spirits; charas (an intoxicating preparation of hemp) is largely smoked. Kashmiris and Path\u00e1ns drink tea.\n\nThe almost universal dress is white cotton of a coarse description, with an occasional blue turban and waistband, loose white trousers (paij\u00e1ma), and leather shoes. In Chach and Mokhad, where the population is almost entirely Afgh\u00e1n, the dress of the lower orders is\nindigo blue, which tints the hands and faces of the wearers, giving them a wild and forbidding appearance. In these tracts, and generally in the western part of the District, the turbans worn are of vast dimensions, and look very imposing. In Khatar, and generally in the hilly tracts bordering on the Indus, sandals, called *kheri*, are worn instead of leather shoes. The women wear the same kind of costume as the men, with the exception of their trousers, which are generally of cotton, dyed blue, with red or yellow lines from top to bottom.\n\nAs regards occupation, the Census Report of 1881 returned the adult male population under the following seven classes\u2014(1) Professional class, including all Government officials, civil and military, 17,209; (2) domestic and menial class, 7995; (3) commercial class, including bankers, merchants, traders, carriers, etc., 10,091; (4) agricultural and pastoral class, including gardeners, 145,611; (5) industrial and manufacturing class, including all artisans, 62,560; (6) indefinite and non-productive class, including general labourers, 27,151; (7) unspecified, 2544.\n\n*Agriculture.*\u2014According to the Punjab Administration Report for 1883\u201384, out of a total District area of 4937\u00bd square miles, or 3,160,116 acres, 1,220,916 acres were under cultivation, 316,800 acres were cultivable, and 1,622,400 acres were uncultivable waste. The staple spring crop of the District is wheat, while *bajra* (spiked millet) forms the mainstay of the autumn harvest. The other crops are\u2014gram, barley, and mustard-seed in the spring; and *jo\u00e1r* (great millet), Indian corn, cotton, and the common pulses in the autumn harvest. Rice is grown to a small extent in the Murree hills, but is of an inferior quality. The cotton too, though improved of late years, is still inferior, being grown only on unirrigated land. Wheat, gram, and rice are increasing in importance as staple products, while the inferior crops of *bajra*, *jo\u00e1r*, and Indian corn, on the other hand, are less cultivated than they used to be. The potato was introduced in the Murree hills shortly after annexation. Some years elapsed before its cultivation became general, but it is now recognised as a lucrative crop, and almost every hill village has its patch of potato cultivation. The people themselves consume the produce to a certain extent; but the greater part is sold in Murree or exported to the plains. Experiments have been made with tea, but in spite of great care and solicitude, every attempt to naturalize the shrub has failed. The area under the principal crops in 1883\u201384 is returned as follows:\u2014Wheat, 436,262 acres; *bajra*, 326,330 acres; Indian corn, 55,277 acres; gram, 36,959 acres; *jo\u00e1r*, 24,169 acres; pulses and other food-grains, 67,237 acres; oil-seeds, 108,314 acres; cotton, 16,936 acres; vegetables, 3160. Sugar-cane, tobacco, drugs, spices, etc., are grown over small areas.\n\nAs almost every field in the District is more or less on an incline, the rain-water rapidly drains away, without benefiting the soil; and it has\nbeen necessary in most cases to retard its escape by a rude system of terraces, embanked at their lower extremity. A more ambitious work, requiring the co-operation of villages and expenditure of capital, is the embankment of ravines, which is practised to some extent both here and in the neighbouring District of Jehlam. Irrigation by any other mode is little employed, and the total irrigated area in 1883-84 was returned at only 34,421 acres. The manured lands yield two crops a year, or are sometimes sown for three consecutive harvests with wheat and bajra alternately, and lie fallow for the fourth; inferior soils are made to bear two crops in the same year (wheat, followed by bajra), and then recruit during the following twelve months. Rotation of crops in any higher form is unknown. The average produce per acre is given in the Government returns for 1883-84 as follows:\u2014Rice, 654 lbs.; wheat, 680 lbs.; inferior grains, 658 lbs.; oil-seeds, 330 lbs.; and cotton, 98 lbs.\n\nThe peasantry are in comfortable circumstances; their houses are neatly furnished and fairly clean, and they are gradually extricating themselves from the village money-lender. Under Sikh rule, it is calculated that 50 per cent. of the cultivators were in debt; at present, only 10 per cent. are believed to be so involved. The tenures of the District are very varied, from the ancestral zamindari, or undivided holding with division of profits, to the modern occupancy right of tenants. Rents vary according to the nature of the soil and the caste and social status of the tenant. A tenant with occupancy rights pays a rent of 4s. 6d. an acre for average land; while a tenant-at-will pays 5s. 9d. for the same land. The ordinary range of rent may be put down at from 5s. to 6s. an acre for the higher class of tenants, and from 4s. to 8s. for the lower class. In many parts of the District, however, especially near Gujjar Khan, all tenants alike pay their rent in kind, at rates varying from one-fourth to one-half of the produce. Both cash and grain rates for tenants-at-will are steadily rising; and many who at the time of the last Land Settlement paid only a one-fourth or a two-fifths share of the produce, are now glad to pay a one-half share. The Government land revenue assessment in 1883-84 amounted to \u00a373,005, being at the rate of 1s. 2d. per cultivated acre.\n\nWages have increased from 50 to 75 per cent. since the Sikh rule. In towns they are paid in cash, unskilled labourers receiving from 3d. to 6d., and skilled labourers from 6d. to 1s. 3d. a day. The agricultural labourer generally receives his wages in kind. The zamindar requiring extra labour obtains it from his neighbours who have no work of their own to do, and in return supplies them with food once daily. This system is called lehtri; and recourse is had to it for carrying on the operations of ploughing, sowing, and reaping. The other plan goes\nby the name of lehar; under it the kamins or village menials, or hill-men, or poor people from other estates, are employed to reap the harvest, and are paid in kind at the rate of one-twentieth part of what they gather during the day. Prices were returned as follows in January 1884:\u2014Wheat, 27 sers per rupee, or 4s. 2d. per cwt.; barley and jowar, 40 sers per rupee, or 2s. 10d. per cwt.; bajra, 45 sers per rupee, or 2s. 6d. per cwt.; Indian corn, 38 sers per rupee, or 2s. 11\u00bdd. per cwt.; rice, 6\u00bd sers per rupee, or 17s. 4d. per cwt.\n\nR\u00e1wal Pindi is a considerable stock-breeding District. The best horses are found in Fatehjang and Pindi Gheb tahsils, where the large size of the holdings in the hands of comparatively wealthy landholders gives greater facility for breeding. The horses are somewhat slight and small, but are well-bred and fiery. Great difficulty, however, is experienced in inducing breeders to bestow sufficient care upon the young colts. They tie them up in close dark quarters, and put them to work while still too young. Most breeders find it too expensive to keep their colts for more than a year, and they sell them at this age to merchants from beyond the Indus. The breed, however, has much improved since the institution of the R\u00e1wal Pindi annual horse fair, at which large numbers are sold as remounts for the Native cavalry, though few are as yet found suitable for British cavalry regiments. Very fine mules are also bred in considerable numbers; and owing to the greater ease with which these animals are reared, and the earlier age at which they can be put to work, this is said to act detrimentally to horse-rearing as being more profitable. In 1884, there were in the District 3228 branded brood mares\u20141090 for horse-breeding and 2138 for mule-breeding. Twenty-five horse stallions and 52 donkey stallions are stationed by Government throughout the District, at places where they are most in request. At the annual horse and mule fair in 1883, out of 1394 animals exhibited, 819 were sold. Prizes were awarded to the amount of \u00a3200. Camels of a fine breed are reared in several parts of the District. R\u00e1wal Pindi was formerly noted for its camels; and although the stock is said to have fallen off since the time of the Mutiny, it still contains a larger number of camels than any other District in the Punjab. Goats and sheep are reared, not so much for sale, as for the wants of the people themselves, and for the sale of the goats' hair and sheep wool, which is exported. The agricultural stock in the District in 1883-84 is returned as follows:\u2014Cows and bullocks, 300,871; horses, 9296; donkeys, 33,258; sheep and goats, 417,144; and camels, 24,149.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014In 1843-44, during the Sikh supremacy, R\u00e1wal Pindi was devastated by an incursion of locusts, which overran the whole country in enormous swarms, and for a while almost succeeded in depopulating the District. They appeared just in time to devour\nthe whole autumn crop of 1843; they remained for the succeeding spring crops; and at last they took their departure after utterly destroying the autumn harvest of 1844. R\u00e1wal Pindi is still suffering from the remote effects of this terrible visitation. The Sikh authorities insisted upon realizing the utmost farthing of their revenue from the starving cultivators, who were obliged to have recourse to the trading classes, and so commenced a system of chronic indebtedness, which has not even yet entirely passed away. The tenures of land were completely revolutionized, to the great disadvantage of the proprietary class, as the Sikhs admitted tenants to share the burdens and privileges of the landowners, in order the more readily to collect their exorbitant imposts. The British courts were for long flooded with litigation, arising from the disorganization of this unhappy period.\n\nCommerce and Trade, etc.\u2014So rugged a District as R\u00e1wal Pindi has naturally but little commerce, and that little is concentrated at the head-quarters town and at H\u00e1zro. The only productions that give rise to any large export trade are food-grains and oil-seeds; but this only happens in years of good harvests. During 1880, 1881, and 1882, grain was imported. In 1883 the export of grain was abnormally large. Among the imports are piece-goods from Amritsar and Calcutta, sugar and g\u00far from J\u00e1l\u00e9ndhar, hardware from Amritsar and Lahore, cotton from Districts south of Jehlam, salt from Pind D\u00e1dan Kh\u00e1n, indigo from M\u00falt\u00e1n, rice from Pesh\u00e1war and Sw\u00e1t. Trade with Kashm\u00edr is registered at two posts, Lakshman ferry and Murree. In 1882\u201383, the imports into R\u00e1wal Pindi from Kashm\u00edr amounted to \u00a3116,959 in value, consisting principally of charas, gh\u00ed, rice, raw silk, shawls, timber, fruit, and dyes; the exports from R\u00e1wal Pindi into Kashm\u00edr were valued at \u00a355,577, principally piece-goods, metals, salt, and sugar.\n\nSnuff of excellent quality is manufactured at H\u00e1zro, and is exported to Kashm\u00edr and Amritsar. Cotton spinners and weavers of country cloth are found in almost every village; and in Fatehjang and Pindi Gheb coarse woollen blankets are manufactured, which find a market at R\u00e1wal Pindi and Pesh\u00e1war towns. Soap is made at R\u00e1wal Pindi, Pindi Gheb, and Fatehjang. Leather manufactures are of considerable extent, and there is also a large manufacture of oil. European industry is represented by a brewery at Murree, established in 1860. The beer is of excellent quality, and commands a ready sale. A gas-work has been recently established at R\u00e1wal Pindi town. The gas is extracted from locally obtained petroleum; but owing to the limited supply of the material, the gas produced has been hitherto barely sufficient to light the barracks and hospital of one European regiment. The wealth resulting from long and settled peace finds its way into the hands of the cultivating classes, and is chiefly hoarded in the form of jewellery. A great horse fair is held annually at R\u00e1wal Pindi town, at\nwhich Government prizes are distributed, and animals from all parts of the Punjab are exhibited and sold.\n\nMeans of Communication.\u2014The Grand Trunk Road was till recently the principal means of communication; its section within the District amounts to 100 miles. The other main lines of road are\u2014R\u00e1wal Pindi to Murree, 39 miles; the Kashmir road from Murree to Kohala, 20 miles; and the R\u00e1wal Pindi and Koh\u00e1t road, 66 miles. There are also unmetalled roads from Hassan Abd\u00e1l to Abbott\u00e1b\u00e1d, Campbellpur to Lawrencepur, 9 miles; Pindi Gheb to Pind Sult\u00e1ni, 20 miles; R\u00e1wal Pindi to Kah\u00fat\u00e1 via Kotli, 49 miles; Fatehjang to K\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1gh, 23 miles; to Tal\u00e1gang, 17\u00bd miles; and to Chakw\u00e1l, 13\u00bc miles; and from Murree via Kotli and Karor to R\u00e1wal Pindi, 54 miles. Total length of metalled roads in 1883\u201384, 135 miles; unmetalled roads, 1123 miles. The Punjab Northern State Railway from Lahore to Pesh\u00e1war now enters the District from the Jehlam border, and runs a course parallel with the Grand Trunk Road to Attock, where the magnificent bridge over the Indus, completed in 1883, carries both the railway and road across the river. A branch line of railway runs from R\u00e1wal Pindi station to Kushalgarh. Total length of railways (1883\u201384), 166 miles. The Indus is navigable throughout its whole course of 96 miles through R\u00e1wal Pindi District by native craft, and becomes practicable for steamers below Mokhad. The Jehlam is not navigable in any portion of its course in R\u00e1wal Pindi. Three telegraph lines traverse the District, namely, the main wire from Lahore to Pesh\u00e1war, a branch from R\u00e1wal Pindi to the hill station at Murree (Marri), and a line to Koh\u00e1t via Kushalgarh.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The ordinary administrative staff of this extensive District comprises a Deputy Commissioner, a Judicial Assistant, 3 Assistant and 2 extra-Assistant Commissioners, 1 Cantonment Magistrate, 7 tahsild\u00e1rs, 4 muns\u00edfs, and 9 honorary magistrates, besides the ordinary medical and constabulary officers. There are garrisons at R\u00e1wal Pindi, Murree (Marri), Attock, and Campbellpur. The total revenue in 1872\u201373 amounted to \u00a389,226, of which \u00a368,659, or more than three-fourths of the whole, was derived from the land-tax. By 1883\u201384, the revenue had increased to \u00a3108,109, while the land-tax remained stationary at \u00a368,878. The other principal items of revenue are stamps, local rates, excise, and opium. In 1883 the District contained 18 first-class and 10 second-class police stations, and the regular police numbered 1022 men of all ranks, being 1 constable to every 803 inhabitants and to every 4\u00b77 square miles. Crimes of violence are still unhappily common; human life is lightly regarded by the wild tribes of the western gorges, and the ancestral blood-feuds are only lulled for a while by the severity of English law. Murders prompted by conjugal jealousy are also of frequent occurrence. The District jail at R\u00e1wal Pindi and lock-ups at Murree and Attock contained a\ntotal of 790 prisoners in 1883. The Salt Revenue Department has a preventive establishment maintained at 15 guard posts along 77 miles of the Indus, with the object of preventing the transit of cheap Koh\u00e1t salt from the right to the left bank of that river.\n\nEducation is making satisfactory progress. In 1883-84, the Government aided and inspected schools under the Education Department numbered 133, with 8933 pupils. There are also 874 indigenous village schools in the District. In 1881, the Census Report returned 8899 boys and 516 girls as under instruction, besides 24,873 males and 763 females able to read and write, but not under instruction. Female education, especially, has made rapid strides of late years, through the benevolent exertions of Bedi Khem Singh, a native gentleman of Kall\u00e1r, who has established 25 girls' schools in this District, besides others in Jehlam (Jhelum); they are chiefly attended by Hindu children, though there is also a fair sprinkling of Muhammadans. The Lawrence Memorial Asylum at Murree is devoted to the education of the children of European soldiers. There is a school for the benefit of the children of European residents at Murree in the hot season, which is transferred to R\u00e1wal Pindi during the winter. There is also a Church of England and a Roman Catholic school for girls at Murree. Since 1882, schools for European boys and girls have been established in R\u00e1wal Pindi town, where there is also a normal school for training teachers.\n\nThere are municipalities at R\u00e1wal Pindi, Murree, Attock, H\u00e1vro, Pindigheb, and Mokhad. The total revenue of these 6 municipalities in 1883-84 amounted to \u00a316,477, being at the rate of 4s. 2\u00bdd. per head of their population.\n\nCantonments and Troops.\u2014The principal military station in the District is the cantonment of R\u00e1wal Pindi, situated within a mile of the city, on the opposite bank of the river Leh. At Murree there is a convalescent depot, and within a four miles' radius of the sanitarium are camps Kuldanah, Thoba, Ghari\u00e1l, and the Cliffden depot. There is also a small cantonment at Campbellpur; and the bridge of boats and ferry over the Indus are guarded by Fort Attock. The ordinary garrison of R\u00e1wal Pindi during the cold weather consists of one battery of horse and one of field artillery, and three mountain batteries; one regiment of British and one of Native cavalry, two regiments of British and two of Native infantry, and a company of sappers and miners. Of these the mountain batteries are quartered in the gullies of Haz\u00e1ra District, and one British infantry regiment in the Murree Hills, with headquarters at camp Kuldanah during the hot season, while detachments of the artillery and cavalry, and of the other British infantry regiments, are quartered at camp Ghari\u00e1l; so that all the British troops of the garrison pass a portion at least of the hot weather in the hills. Murree is garrisoned during the season by convalescents detached\nfrom the R\u00e1wal Pindi and Pesh\u00e1war Divisions, and the married women and children are stationed at Cliffden. Campbellpur is garrisoned by two batteries of artillery, and Fort Attock by detachments from the British infantry regiment quartered at Naushahra in the Pesh\u00e1war Division, one of the Native infantry regiments at R\u00e1wal Pindi, and the battery at Campbellpur. The cantonments and military posts of the District belong to the R\u00e1wal Pindi Division, and the troops are under the command of the general officer commanding that Division. The R\u00e1wal Pindi fort, which has five faces, with a bastion at each corner on which heavy guns are mounted, contains an arsenal and barracks for two companies of infantry or a heavy battery. There are good positions for defence on the east and west of the station. The south-west side is covered by a network of nala, which render approach from that direction very difficult. The head-quarters of two companies of the 1st Punjab Volunteer Corps are at R\u00e1wal Pindi. A cadet company is composed of the boys of the Murree Lawrence Asylum.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014R\u00e1wal Pindi has two rainy seasons, the first from January to March, and the second from July to August. During the winter, the weather is cold and even severe, but in summer the heat cannot be exceeded in any part of India. Notwithstanding the excessive heat of May, June, and part of July, the climate of R\u00e1wal Pindi is noted for its salubrity, and the District is one of the healthiest for European troops in the Province. The climate of the Murree Hills is said to be peculiarly adapted to the English constitution. The average annual mean temperature in the shade at R\u00e1wal Pindi is returned at $69^\\circ 4$ F., and at Murree, $56^\\circ 1$ F. In 1883, the maximum, minimum, and mean temperatures of the two stations were returned as follows:\u2014R\u00e1wal Pindi\u2014May\u2014max. $107^\\circ 5$, min. $59^\\circ 1$, mean $82^\\circ 1$; July\u2014max. $108^\\circ$, min. $68^\\circ 7$, mean $87^\\circ 8$; December\u2014max. $69^\\circ 9$, min. $30^\\circ 5$, mean $50^\\circ 8$. Murree\u2014May\u2014max. $84^\\circ 9$, min. $43^\\circ 8$, mean $66^\\circ 8$; July\u2014max. $85^\\circ$, min. $57^\\circ 4$, mean $70^\\circ 4$; December\u2014max. $58^\\circ 8$, min. $29^\\circ 9$, mean $44^\\circ 4$. The average annual rainfall for a period of seventeen years ending 1882\u201383 is returned at $30^\\circ 7$ inches at R\u00e1wal Pindi, and $47^\\circ 1$ inches at Murree. In 1883, $27^\\circ 6$ inches of rain were registered at R\u00e1wal Pindi, and $37^\\circ 5$ inches at Murree. The principal disease of the District is fever, which exists in an endemic form. The total number of reported deaths from all causes in 1883 was $21,477$, or at the rate of $26$ per thousand. Of these deaths, as many as $16,738$, or $20^\\circ 40$ per thousand, were assigned to fever alone. Nine charitable dispensaries afforded medical relief to $2291$ in-door and $92,337$ out-door patients in 1883. Cattle diseases are very prevalent, and carry off a large number of the live-stock.\n\nR\u00e1wal Pindi.\u2014Tahsil in the north-east of R\u00e1wal Pindi District, Punjab, lying along the foot of the Murree (Marri) Hills. Area, 769\nsquare miles, with 1 town and 442 villages; number of houses, 24,107, of which 18,024 are occupied and 6083 unoccupied; number of families, 27,089. Total population (1881) 211,275, namely, males 122,467, and females 88,808; proportion of males, 57.9 per cent. The high proportion of males is owing to the large military population of the R\u00e1wal Pindi cantonment. Classified according to religion, the population consists of\u2014Muhammadans, 165,734; Hindus, 35,502; Sikhs, 5886; Jains, 940; Christians, 3052; and P\u00e1rs\u00eds, 161. Of a total area of 769 square miles, the average area under crops for the five years 1877-78 to 1881-82 was returned at 317 square miles, or 202,909 acres; the area under the principal crops being\u2014wheat, 81,686 acres; b\u00e1jra, 46,743 acres; Indian corn, 11,389 acres; barley, 11,224 acres; moth, 11,044 acres; jo\u00e1r, 7263 acres; cotton, 7657 acres. Revenue of the tahsil, \u00a314,789. The administrative staff (including all the head-quarter officers of the Division and District) consisted in 1884 of the Commissioner of the R\u00e1wal Pindi Division, the Deputy Commissioner of the District, a Judicial Assistant Commissioner, 3 Assistant and extra-Assistant Commissioners, Judge of the Small Cause Court, tahsild\u00e1r, 2 muns\u00edfs, and 3 honorary magistrates. These officers preside over 11 civil and 11 criminal courts. Number of police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), 4; strength of regular police, 164 men; village watch or rural police (chaukid\u00e1rs), 223.\n\nR\u00e1wal Pindi.\u2014Town, municipality, large military cantonment, and administrative head-quarters of R\u00e1wal Pindi Division and District, Punjab; situated in 33\u00b0 37' N. lat., and 73\u00b0 6' E. long., on the north bank of the river Leh, a muddy, sluggish stream, flowing between lofty and precipitous banks, and separating the town from the cantonments.\n\nThe present town is of quite modern origin; but General Cunningham has identified certain ruins on the site of the cantonments with the ancient city of Gajipur or Gajnipur, the capital of the Bhatti tribe in the ages preceding the Christian era. Greek and other early coins, together with ancient bricks, occur over an area of two square miles. Known within historial times as Fatehpur Baori, R\u00e1wal Pindi fell into decay during one of the Mughal invasions in the 14th century. Jhanda Kh\u00e1n, a Ghakkar chief, restored the town, and gave it its present name. Sard\u00e1r Milka Singh, a Sikh adventurer, occupied it in 1765, and invited traders from the neighbouring commercial centres of Jehlam (Jhelum) and Sh\u00e1hpur to settle in his territory. In the beginning of the present century, R\u00e1wal Pindi became for a time the refuge of Sh\u00e1h Shuj\u00e1, the exiled Am\u00edr of K\u00e1b\u00fal, and of his brother Sh\u00e1h Zam\u00e1n. The present native infantry lines mark the site of a battle fought by the Ghakkars under their famous chief Sult\u00e1n Mukar\u00e1b Kh\u00e1n in the middle of the last century. It was at R\u00e1wal Pindi, on the 14th March 1849, that the Sikh army under Chattar Singh\nand Sher Singh finally laid down their arms after the battle of Gujrat. On the introduction of British rule, R\u00e1wal Pindi became the site of a British cantonment, and shortly afterwards the head-quarters of a Division; while its recent connection with the main railway system by the extension of the Punjab Northern State Railway to Peshawar has immensely developed both its size and commercial importance.\n\nThe population of R\u00e1wal Pindi town, civil station, and cantonment has almost doubled within the thirteen years between 1868 and 1881. In 1868, the total population was returned at 28,586, and in 1881 at 52,975, namely, males 35,985, and females 16,990. The population of the city proper, including the civil lines, increased from 19,228 in 1868 to 26,785 in 1881. Classified according to religion, the population of the town and cantonment in 1881 consisted of\u2014Muhammadans, 23,664; Hindus, 23,419; Sikhs, 1919; Jains, 904; and \u2018others\u2019 (nearly all Christians, with a few Parsis), 3069. Number of houses, 8029. The municipal revenue, which in 1875-76 amounted to \u00a35,129, had increased by 1883-84 to \u00a311,984. It is mainly derived from octroi duties levied on articles of food brought within the city or cantonments.\n\nThe cantonments are separated from the native town by the little river Leh, and occupy the site of an ancient Hindu city (vide supra). The buildings cover an area of three miles in length by two in breadth. In 1868, the cantonments contained a total population of 9358, including English and native troops. Since the last Afgh\u00e1n campaign, R\u00e1wal Pindi has much increased in importance as a military station, and in 1881 the cantonments contained a total population of 26,190, or nearly three times the population of 1868. The garrison usually consists of one regiment of European cavalry, two regiments of European infantry, one regiment of Native cavalry, and two regiments of Native infantry, with two batteries of artillery (horse and field), increased in the cold weather by three mountain batteries, which in the summer occupy the hills north of Murree. An arsenal was established at R\u00e1wal Pindi in 1883. The cantonment contains several European shops.\n\nThe principal buildings of R\u00e1wal Pindi station are the courts of the Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner, Cantonment Magistrate\u2019s court, Brigade Commissariat Transport offices, and office of the Paymaster, Punjab circle, all within the civil lines. The native town contains the tahsil building, police station, municipal hall, and city hospital, all situated at the point where the road from the cantonments, an extension of the sadr b\u00e1z\u00e1r, enters the city. At the same point are the large sardi or native inn, the Presbyterian Mission Church, and the Mission School. A large and handsome public garden is maintained by the municipality; and an extensive park, thickly planted with trees and shrubs, and intersected with winding paths and drives, has been\nlaid out by the District authorities near the jail. The park is a favourite evening and morning resort of the Europeans of the station. The garrison church, a large but unpicturesque building, contains a window in memory of the late Bishop Milman of Calcutta, who died and was buried at R\u00e1wal Pindi in 1876.\n\nThe railway station, telegraph office, and post-office are all fine massive buildings. There are also the station club, three good European hotels, several European shops, and a branch of the Alliance Bank of Simla. The main b\u00e1z\u00e1r contains numerous good P\u00e1rsi and other shops, and the office of the Punjab Times. At the entrance to the b\u00e1z\u00e1r, a fine archway has been erected in remembrance of Brigadier-General Massy; and a handsome and spacious market, built by Sard\u00e1r Sujan Singh at a cost of \u00a320,000, perpetuates the memory of the same officer. The barracks and church are lit with gas manufactured from petroleum found in the District. The educational and charitable institutions at R\u00e1wal Pindi include a normal school for training teachers, schools for European boys and girls, a civil hospital, and leper asylum. R\u00e1wal Pindi is also the head-quarters of the Manager and other heads of Departments of the Punjab Northern State Railway. The fort, which also contains the arsenal, has five faces, with a bastion at each corner on which heavy guns are mounted.\n\nThe oldest portion of the town is its north-eastern corner, where the b\u00e1z\u00e1rs are narrow and crooked, after the fashion of most native cities of small size. But elsewhere the streets are broad, straight, handsome, and regular; and as a result of this, and of the excellent drainage and sanitary arrangements, R\u00e1wal Pindi is said to present a cleaner appearance than probably any other town in Northern India. Trees have been freely planted, and give the station a very pleasing appearance.\n\nA considerable portion of the trade of the Punjab with Kashmir passes through R\u00e1wal Pindi, in 1882 amounting to as much as 31 per cent. of the import and 16 per cent. of the export trade of the Province with Kashmir. Wheat and other grains are largely collected at R\u00e1wal Pindi and exported to other parts of the Punjab. Some of the commercial houses have very extensive dealings; and there are several native banking houses of high standing. There are no manufactures or industries of importance. The chief articles manufactured are s\u00fasi, a coarse kind of cloth, dyed blue and red and used for women's attire; cotton cloth, shoes, blankets, combs, and snuff. Oil, soap, and untanned leather jars (kup\u00e1s) are also made. The great majority of the town population consists of Ghakkars, Bhattis, Aw\u00e1ns, Kashmiris, Khattris, and Br\u00e1hmans, the last two having a monopoly of the trade.\n\nR\u00e1ya.\u2014South-eastern tahsil of Si\u00e1lkot District, Punjab, extending along the bank of the river R\u00e1vi. Area, 476 square miles; towns\nand villages, 461; number of houses, 26,936, namely, occupied 23,907, and unoccupied 3029; number of families, 40,775. Total population (1881) 194,205, namely, males 104,472, and females 89,733; proportion of males, 53.8 per cent. Classified according to religion, the population consists of\u2014Muhammadans, 129,796; Hindus, 53,214; Sikhs, 11,084; Jains, 24; and Christians, 87. Average density of population, 408 persons per square mile. Of the 461 towns and villages, 333 contain less than five hundred inhabitants; 97 from five hundred to a thousand; and 31 from one to five thousand inhabitants. Of a total area of 476 square miles, the average annual area under crops for the five years 1877-78 to 1881-82 was returned at 268 square miles, or 171,279 acres; the principal crops being\u2014wheat, 85,272 acres; barley, 17,749 acres; rice, 12,684 acres; Indian corn, 8353 acres; jo\u00e1r, 6712 acres; other food-grains, 3173 acres; sugar-cane, 8016 acres; cotton, 4910 acres; tobacco, 1182 acres; and vegetables, 1255 acres. Revenue of the tahsil, \u00a324,120. The administrative staff consists of a tahsild\u00e1r, a munsif, and an honorary magistrate. These officers preside over 2 civil and 2 criminal courts. Number of police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), 3; strength of regular police, 58 men; village watch or rural police (chauk\u00edd\u00e1rs), 497.\n\nRayachoti.\u2014T\u00e1luk or Sub-division of Cuddapah (Kadap\u00e1) District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 13\u00b0 51' to 14\u00b0 20' N., long. 78\u00b0 28' to 79\u00b0 10' E. Area, 998 square miles. Population (1871) 128,162; (1881) 92,541, namely, 47,376 males and 45,165 females, occupying 21,734 houses, in 1 town and 92 villages. Hindus number 82,295; Muhammadans, 10,178; Christians, 63; and 'others,' 5. The t\u00e1luk is the most central in the District. The general appearance is that of a level with here and there some scattered granite rocks, and with a horizontal line of unbroken hills closing in the horizon to the north and east. The soils are of different kinds, the red predominating. The t\u00e1luk is well provided with roads, all of which centre in the chief town, Rayachoti, where seven roads meet. Rice and sujja (Holcus spicatus) are the principal products. Manufactures are few, and are confined to indigo, common cloth, coarse blankets, and gunny-bags. Good pasture-grounds abound all over the t\u00e1luk, and except in very bad years there is no want of grazing. A large portion of the t\u00e1luk lies waste, owing to the cultivators having no capital with which to bring it under cultivation, and no market to which to take the produce when grown. The cattle are small but hardy. The t\u00e1luk contained in 1883\u2014criminal courts, 2; police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), 11; regular police, 87 men. Land revenue, \u00a311,534.\n\nRayachoti.\u2014Head-quarters of Rayachoti t\u00e1luk, Cuddapah (Kadap\u00e1) District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 14\u00b0 4' N., long. 78\u00b0 50' E. Situated on the banks of the Mand\u00e1vi river, with seven roads converging on it. Population (1881) 4367, dwelling in 912 houses. Hindus numbered\n2634; Muhammadans, 1729; and Christians, 4. The town has little trade; weekly market and old temple. The annual car festival is attended by about 6000 persons.\n\n**R\u00e1yadrug.**\u2014T\u00e1luk and town in Bellary District, Madras Presidency. \u2014See RAIDRUG.\n\n**R\u00e1yagudda** (or R\u00e1j\u00e1gudda).\u2014Kandh village in Jaipur zamind\u00e1ri, Vizagapatam District, Madras Presidency.

Sub-magistrate's station, with thriving trade.\n\n**R\u00e1yak.**\u2014Village and police outpost in the Garo Hills District, Assam; on the Someswari river. Considerable population engaged in fishing.\n\n**R\u00e1yakottai.**\u2014Village in Krishnagiri t\u00e1luk, Salem District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 12\u00b0 31' N., long. 78\u00b0 5' E. Population (1871) 1881; (1881) 1087, dwelling in 214 houses. Hindus number 976; Muhammadans, 102; and Christians, 9. R\u00e1yakottai was formerly a favourite place of residence for military pensioners, who have, especially since the famine of 1876\u201378, abandoned it in large numbers. North of the town stands the durgam (hill fort) R\u00e1yakottai, one of the B\u00e1ramah\u00e1l fortresses, until recently occupied by troops. It commanded one of the most important passes, and its capture by Major Gowdie in 1791 was the first exploit in Lord Cornwallis' great march. The fort was ceded to the English by the treaty of 1792; and it was under its walls that the army of General Harris encamped in 1799, before entering Mysore territory on the way to Seringapatam. The remains of the fort (2449 feet above sea-level) still exist, as does also the European cemetery at the foot of the hill.\n\n**R\u00e1yalcheruvu** (R\u00edyal's tank).\u2014Village in Nar\u00e1invaram t\u00e1luk of Karwaitnagar zamind\u00e1ri, North Arcot District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 13\u00b0 30' 5\" N., long. 79\u00b0 27' 30\" E. Population (1881) 257, dwelling in 52 houses. The village is noteworthy on account of its large tank, built, it is said, by Krishnadeva R\u00e1yalu of Vijianagar. The bund (embankment), resting on two hills, is half a mile long, 70 feet high, and 120 feet broad. The village was once of some importance, being on the road from Tirupati to Conjevaram (K\u00e1nchivaram), but pilgrims now use the north-west line of Madras Railway.\n\n**R\u00e1yan.**\u2014Town in Jodhpur State, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. Lat. 26\u00b0 32' N., long. 74\u00b0 17' E.; 27 miles north-west of Jodhpur city. A fort, situated on a rock about 200 feet above the plain, commands the whole town.

Chief manufacture, g\u00far or coarse sugar; which, with wheat, is largely exported. Markets are held twice a week, and skilled labour is readily procurable. The early Gond rulers were succeeded by a race of shepherds called Baladeo, who first settled at Kham\u00e1ria, a mile off, but afterwards removed to Rehl\u00ed, where they built a fort. The place next passed to the Bundel\u00e1 chief of Panna, R\u00e1j\u00e1 Chhatar S\u00e1l, who granted it with other territory to B\u00e1j\u00ed R\u00e1o Peshw\u00e1, in return for his assistance against Muhammad Kh\u00e1n Bangash, the Governor of Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d. The present fort was built by the Peshw\u00e1. It stands opposite the junction of the Sun\u00e1r and Deh\u00e1r rivers, on a height commanding the town, and encloses nearly 2 acres, once covered by Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 buildings. In 1817, Rehl\u00ed, with S\u00e1gar, was ceded to the British. The town has a handsome school-house, attended by 140 boys; a female school, attended by 32 girls; dispensary, and post-office.\n\nRekapalli.\u2014Petty t\u00e1luk of God\u00e1vari District, Madras Presidency. Rekapalli t\u00e1luk, with Bhadr\u00e1chalam, was transferred from the Central Provinces in 1884, and now forms a part of the Agency tract of God\u00e1vari District. Area in Rekapalli t\u00e1luk, together with Bhadr\u00e1chalam, 911 square miles; population (1881) 35,656, namely, males 18,220, and females 17,436, occupying 6973 houses in 261 villages.

Celebrated for a religious fair held annually in February in honour of Ksh\u00edr\u00edchor\u00e1 Gopi-\nn\u00e1th, a form of Krishna; it lasts about 13 days, and is attended by from 10,000 to 12,000 persons. About \u00a3600 worth of goods are sold, consisting chiefly of toys, sweetmeats, fruits, vegetables, country cloth, etc. The temple of the god is an unsightly stone edifice defaced by indecent sculptures. It is much frequented during the months of February, April, and November.\n\n**Rengan.**\u2014Petty State in Rewa K\u00e1ntha, Bombay Presidency. Area, 4 square miles. There are 8 chiefs. Estimated revenue, \u00a3104; tribute of \u00a346, 2s. is paid to the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda.\n\n**Rengm\u00e1.**\u2014Mountain group in the N\u00e1g\u00e1 Hills, Assam, forming a portion of the range known as the Mikir Hills, lying between the Jamuna and Kali\u00e1n\u00ed rivers. Lat. 26\u00b0 15' to 26\u00b0 30' N., and long. 93\u00b0 24' to 93\u00b0 40' E.; height, between 2000 and 3000 feet above sea-level. The slopes are steep, and clothed with dense jungle and underwood. The Rengm\u00e1 N\u00e1g\u00e1s, by whom this tract is now inhabited, are by far the least savage of the N\u00e1g\u00e1 tribes, being scarcely distinguishable from the Mikirs, who occupy the tract to the north. They are immigrants from the more remote tracts of the N\u00e1g\u00e1 Hills, lying to the east of the Dhaneswar\u00ed (Dhansiri) river, where some villages of the tribe still survive.\n\n**Rengtipah\u00e1r.**\u2014Mountain range in the south of Cachar District, Assam; running northwards from the Lush\u00e1i Hills, and forming the watershed between the Son\u00e1i and Dh\u00e1leswar\u00ed rivers.\n\n**Ren\u00ed.**\u2014Town in Bikaner (Bickaneer) State, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. Population (1881) 5198, namely, Hindus, 3673; Muhammadans, 984; and 'others,' 541.\n\n**Reot\u00ed.**\u2014Town in B\u00e1nsdih tahsil, Ballia District, North-Western Provinces; situated in lat. 25\u00b0 51' N., and long. 84\u00b0 25' 13\" E., 12 miles from B\u00e1nsdih town. Population (1881) 9933, namely, Hindus 8897, and Muhammadans 1036. Reot\u00ed is the head-quarters of the Nikumbh R\u00e1jputs, and presents a dirty and overcrowded appearance. The principal proprietors are non-resident, and the resident R\u00e1jput zam\u00ednd\u00e1rs have lost their hereditary influence, as seven-eighths of the town are now owned by strangers. The main street runs east and west, and is in fact a part of the Bairi\u00e1-Sahatw\u00e1r road. A little manufacture of country cloth, shoes, and palanquins is carried on; but with this exception, Reoti is a mere agricultural centre, with little or no trade. Police station, middle school, and post-office. A small house-tax is levied for police and conservancy purposes.\n\n**Reot\u00edpur.**\u2014Town in Zam\u00e1ni\u00e1 tahsil, Gh\u00e1zipur District, North-Western Provinces, situated in lat. 25\u00b0 32' 16\" N., and long. 83\u00b0 45' 19\" E., 8 miles south-east of Gh\u00e1zipur town, and 12 miles north-east of Zam\u00e1ni\u00e1. Population (1881) 10,297, namely, Hindus 9720, and Muhammadans 577. Reot\u00edpur is a purely agricultural village of\nmud huts, remarkable solely for its population. It belongs to the powerful clan of Sakarw\u00e1r-Bh\u00fainh\u00e1rs, the owners of the large Sherpur-Reotipur taluk or estate. Anglo-vernacular school.\n\nRepalli.\u2014Taluk or Sub-division of Kistna District, Madras Presidency. The taluk lies on the right bank of the Kistna river, extending from the sea to the Mangalagiri hills. Area, 644 square miles. Population (1881) 184,340, namely, 93,093 males and 91,247 females, occupying 31,415 houses, in 1 town and 147 villages. Hindus number 175,833; Muhammadans, 7014; Christians, 1467; and \u2018others,\u2019 26. The surface of Repalli taluk is almost wholly composed of river alluvium, and some portions resemble Holland in lying below sea-level. It is well irrigated by anicut channels. In Repalli taluk are the ruins of Tsandavolu, a place of great antiquity, with a temple and Buddhist mound. Gold coins are frequently found here, and in 1874 some workmen came upon several masses of molten gold as large as bricks. In searching for concealed treasure, trenches have been dug in the village laying bare the solid masonry foundations of very extensive buildings. In 1883 the taluk contained \u2014criminal courts, 2; police circles (th\u00e1nds), 9; regular police, 74 men. Land revenue, \u00a373,058.\n\nRepalli.\u2014Head-quarters town of Repalli taluk, Kistna District, Madras Presidency.

Estimated area, 10,000 square miles. Population (1881) 1,305,124. Bounded on the north by the British Districts of Banda, Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d, and M\u00edrz\u00e1pur, in the North-Western Provinces; on the east by part of M\u00edrz\u00e1pur District and by Native States in Chuti\u00e1 (Chota) N\u00e1gpur; on the south by the British Districts of Chhat\u00edsgarh, Mandla, and Jabalpur (Jubbulpore), in the Central Provinces; and on the west by Maihar, Nagode, Soh\u00e1wal, and Kothi States in Baghelkhand.\n\nThe western and north-western portions of the State are occupied by\nmountains, rising in three successive plateaux, or vast terraces, from the valley of the Ganges. Of these, the one lying to the north-east, and styled by Franklin the \"Bindhachal,\" or First Range, is the lowest, having an average elevation of only 500 feet above the sea; it is formed of horizontal strata of sandstone, the upper surface presenting an expanse of very great sterility. Little of this plateau, however, is included within the limits of Rew\u00e1, the boundary of which on this side coincides nearly with the base of the second range, or Panna Hills. The elevation of these mountains is from 900 to 1200 feet above the sea. They consist of sandstone intermixed with schist and quartz, and, to the west, overlaid with limestone. Above this plateau, nearly parallel to the brow, but more to the south-east, rises the K\u00e1imur range. The Tons (south-eastern) and its tributaries, which drain the second plateau, descend to the lower levels in cascades, varying in height from that of Bilohi with 400 feet to that of Chach\u00e1i with 200. About a third of the country lying south-east of the K\u00e1imur Hills constitutes part of the basin of the S\u00f3n, a tract as yet almost unexplored. That great river, rising in the extreme south of Rew\u00e1, flows through the State in a north and north-easterly direction, crossing the north-eastern frontier into the District of M\u00edrz\u00e1pur. Its principal tributary is the Mah\u00e1nadi, joining it on the left side, in lat. 24\u00b0 5' N., and long. 81\u00b0 6' E. The Tons, running north-east from Maihar, first touches the State in lat. 24\u00b0 25' N., and long. 80\u00b0 55' E., and draining the highlands, receives the Beher, the Biland, and several minor torrents. It holds a course generally north-easterly, and passes in lat. 25\u00b0 1' N., and long. 81\u00b0 51' E., into the British District of Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d, its length in Rew\u00e1 being 80 miles. None of the rivers are navigable.'\u2014Condensed from Thornton.\n\nThe State is rich in minerals and forest produce. A seam of coal of good quality has lately (1882-83) been discovered by the Geological Survey Department at Um\u00e1ria, a village in the pargan\u00e1 of R\u00e1mnagar, in the north-western extremity of Rew\u00e1 State, 37 miles from Katni station on the Jabalpur extension of the East Indian Railway. The coal has been tested and found to be a valuable fuel. The Katni-Um\u00e1ria section of the Bil\u00e1spur-Et\u00e1wah Railway, to bring the coal-fields in connection with the East Indian Railway system, has been sanctioned. Coal of even better quality has been found also in the valley of the Johilla river and at Soh\u00e1gpur.\n\nThe prevailing classes of soil are mair, sengawan, domat, and bhata. Mair is a black soil, which retains water and moisture well, and needs no irrigation. It produces valuable crops of wheat and other grain. Sengawan is a whitish clay, suitable for crops of any kind. Domat (literally two soils) is mair and sengawan mixed, and it produces the crops of both varieties. Bhata, red dry soil, is the worst class, pro-\nducing only inferior crops. Tanks are seldom constructed for irrigation. Owing to the want of embankments, many miles of undulating and cultivable land lie untilled.\n\nThe forests of Rew\u00e1, which formerly contained large stores of excellent timber\u2014teak, s\u00e1l (Shorea robusta), khair (Acacia Catechu), saj (Terminalia tomentosa), tendu (Diospyros melanxylon) \u2014 suffered greatly from indiscriminate felling by sleeper contractors during the rule of the late Mahar\u00e1j\u00e1. At present there is but little good timber in the State. A system of forest conservancy has been established, and considerable areas are now marked off as reserve forests. In 1883\u201384, 136 square miles were demarcated. There is a fair trade in lac (Coccus Lacca), and quantities of mahua (flower of the Bassia latifolia), burra (Quercus infectoria), resin, and gums are yearly exported. The revenue derived from lac is estimated at \u00a36000.\n\nThe Jabalpur extension of the East Indian Railway crosses the western boundary of the State, the stations of Satna and Dabhaura being in Rew\u00e1 territory. The Great Deccan road passes through the State.\n\nAccording to the family history kept in the Court Records, it appears that the original founder of this principality was Bilagar Deo or Biag Deo (hence the name Baghel), who, leaving his own country in Gujar\u00e1t in 580 A.D., ostensibly on a religious pilgrimage, but in reality to seize whatever undefended territory he could, first made himself master of the fort of Murpha, and eventually of most of the country from K\u00e1lpi to Chandalgarh, and married the daughter of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Pirhaw\u00e1n. Bilagar Deo was succeeded by his son, Kurun Deo, in 615, who added to his possessions a large portion of what at present constitutes Rew\u00e1, and called it Baghelkhand. He married the daughter of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Mandla, and obtained in dower the famous fort of Bandogarh, to which he removed his court. The chiefship descended from father to son for many generations, with varying fortunes. In the time of Birbhan R\u00e1o, the 19th R\u00e1j\u00e1, who succeeded in 1601, the family of Hum\u00e1y\u00fan Sh\u00e1h, Emperor of Delhi, being forced by Sher Sh\u00e1h to flee from Delhi, found shelter in Rew\u00e1 territory.\n\nIn 1618, Vikram\u00e1ditya succeeded and made Rew\u00e1 his capital, building the fort and town. Abd\u00fat Singh, the 27th R\u00e1j\u00e1, was only six months old when his father died; and Hardi Sah, the Bundel\u00e1 chief of Panna, taking advantage of his infancy, invaded Rew\u00e1, and took possession of the capital. The young chief and his mother fled to Part\u00e1bgarh, and after a time, with the assistance of the Emperor of Delhi, expelled Hardi Sah. Abd\u00fat Singh was succeeded by Aj\u00edt Singh, and he in turn by Jai Singh Deo, in 1809. It was during his rule that British influence was established in Baghelkhand, and the first formal treaty between the British Government and Rew\u00e1 was made with Jai Singh Deo in 1812.\nIn 1812, a body of Pind\u00e1ri marauders invaded M\u00edrz\u00e1pur through Rew\u00e1 State. The R\u00e1j\u00e1, who was believed to have abetted this enterprise, was required to accede to a treaty by which he was acknowledged as ruler of his dominions, and was brought under the protection of the British Government, to whose arbitration he bound himself to refer all disputes with neighbouring chiefs, and engaged to allow British troops to march through, or be stationed in, his territories. The R\u00e1j\u00e1, however, failed to fulfil his obligations, and when a military post was established in his territory, he attempted to starve out the detachment. Troops were sent to enforce the execution of the engagements; and in June 1813 a second treaty was made confirming the first, and defining more clearly the relations of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 with the British Government.\n\nJai Singh Deo abdicated in favour of his son, Bishn\u00e1th Singh, who was succeeded in 1834 by his son, Raghir\u00e1j Singh. In 1847 the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 abolished sati throughout his dominions. For his services during the Mutiny of 1857, the tracts of Soh\u00e1gpur and Amarkantak were granted to Raghir\u00e1j Singh, who also received the distinction of Knight Grand Commander of the Star of India. The Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 was also granted a sanad of adoption and a personal salute of 19 guns. Raghir\u00e1j Singh died in 1880, and has been succeeded by his son, Bankatesh Raman Singh, during whose minority the State is under the management of the Political Agent and Superintendent of Rew\u00e1, who is assisted by a Council of 10 Sard\u00e1rs, members of the ruling family.\n\nThe population of Rew\u00e1 State, according to the Census of 1881, was returned at 1,305,124, namely, 654,182 males and 650,942 females. Hindus numbered 971,788; Muhammadans, 31,107; Jains, 86; Christians, 28; Sikhs, 8; aboriginal tribes, 302,107. Hindus were classed\u2014Br\u00e1hmans, 206,173; R\u00e1jputs, 43,609; Ah\u00edrs, 61,586; Baniy\u00e1s, 29,365; Kurm\u00eds, 78,764; and \u2018others,\u2019 552,291. The aboriginal tribes were\u2014Gonds, 139,626, and Kols, 162,481. The principal landholders are Br\u00e1hmans, R\u00e1jputs, Kurm\u00eds, and Gonds; the two latter are cultivators as well as proprietors. Rent is generally paid in kind, and varies from one-sixth to one-tenth of the gross produce. The revenue of the State in 1883\u201384 from all sources amounted to \u00a3111,258, of which \u00a370,609 was derived from the land. The State maintained in 1883\u201384 a force of 371 cavalry, 564 infantry, 6 field guns, and 77 artillerymen.\n\nThe average annual rainfall at Rew\u00e1 for the three years ending 1875\u201376 was 59 inches; the rainfall in 1883 was 29'85 inches.\n\nRew\u00e1.\u2014Chief town of the State of Rew\u00e1 in Baghelkhand, Central India. Lat. 24\u00b0 31' 30\" N., long. 81\u00b0 20' E.; 131 miles south-west of All\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d, and 182 north-east of S\u00e1gar. Population (1881) 22,016,\nnamely, 11,010 males and 11,006 females. Hindus number 17,413; Muhammadans, 4581; and 'others,' 22. Thornton states that the town is surrounded by 3 ramparts, of which the innermost encloses the palace of the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1.\n\nRewadanda.\u2014Town and port in the Al\u00edb\u00e1gh Sub-division of Kol\u00e1ba District, Bombay Presidency; situated 6 miles south by east of Al\u00edb\u00e1gh, in lat. 18\u00b0 3' 50\" N., and long. 72\u00b0 58' E. Population (1881) 6908, namely, Hindus, 6072; Muhammadans, 493; Jains, 23; Christians, 28; P\u00e1rs\u00eds, 2; and 'others,' 290. The town has many interesting remains of the Portuguese, whose last possession in the Konkan it was, especially the walls and fort of Korle surmounted by a tower. The harbour formed by the mouth of Kondalika river is small, but safe and deep (7 fathoms). The bar has 2 fathoms at low water of spring tides; the channel is sinuous. During the fine season steamers call almost daily, and large boats pass up to Robe, 18 miles distant. No road communication. Average annual value of trade for the five years ending 1881\u201382, \u00a330,670 of imports, and \u00a347,897 of exports. In 1881\u201382, the value of imports was \u00a327,033, and of exports \u00a337,833. Rewadanda is one of the five ports of the Al\u00edb\u00e1gh Customs Division. Post-office; school.\n\nRew\u00e1 K\u00e1ntha (The banks of Rew\u00e1 or Narbad\u00e1).\u2014Political Agency subordinate to the Government of Bombay, established 1821\u201326, having under its control 61 separate States, great and small. Of the 61 States, 3 pay no tribute, 5 are tributary to the British Government (3 of these pay also tribute to the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda), 1 to Chhota Udaipur, and the rest to the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda. The States lie between 21\u00b0 23' and 23\u00b0 33' N. lat., and 73\u00b0 3' and 74\u00b0 18' E. long. Besides lands stretching about 50 miles along the south bank of the Narbad\u00e1, Rew\u00e1 K\u00e1ntha includes an irregular band of territory from 10 to 50 miles broad, passing north of the Narbad\u00e1 to about 12 miles beyond the Mah\u00ed, and an isolated strip on the west lying chiefly along the left bank of the Mah\u00ed. Bounded on the north by the Mew\u00e1r States of Dungarpur and B\u00e1nsw\u00e1da; on the east by the Sub-divisions of Jh\u00e1lod and Dohad of Panch Mah\u00e1ls District, Al\u00ed R\u00e1jpur, and other petty States of Bhop\u00e1war Agency, and part of Kh\u00e1ndesh District; on the south by Baroda territory and Surat District; and on the west by Broach District, Baroda State, Panch Mah\u00e1ls, Kaira, and Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d Districts. Extreme length from north to south, about 140 miles; breadth from east to west varying from 10 to 50 miles; area, 4792 square miles. Population (1881) 543,452. Revenue, about \u00a316c,000.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014In the outlying villages to the west along the Mah\u00ed, and in the north and south where Rew\u00e1 K\u00e1ntha stretches into the plains of Gujar\u00e1t, the country is open and flat; but generally the Agency is hilly. Its two principal ranges are\u2014(1) in the south, the\nR\u00e1jpipla hills, the westmost spurs of the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1s, forming the water-parting between the Narbad\u00e1 and T\u00e1pti valleys; and (2) across the centre of the Agency, the spurs of the Vindhya range running west from the sandstone-crowned table-land of Ratanm\u00e1l, and forming the water-parting between the Narbad\u00e1 and the Mah\u00ed. In the 120 miles of the course of the Mah\u00ed through Rew\u00e1 K\u00e1ntha, the country changes from wild forest-clad hills in the east to a flat bare plain in the west. Its deep banks make the Mah\u00ed of little use for irrigation. Its stream is too shallow and its bed too rocky to allow of navigation. The Narbad\u00e1 enters the Agency through a country of hill and forest with wooded or steep craggy banks. For the last 40 miles of its course, the country grows rich and open, the banks lower, the bed widens, and the stream is deep and slow enough for water-carriage. For 8 miles it is tidal.\n\n**Geology.**\u2014The Rew\u00e1 K\u00e1ntha rocks belong to five classes\u2014metamorphic, quartzite sandstone, cretaceous, trap, and nummulite. The Agency has a considerable store of mineral wealth. The chief precious stones are agate and carnelians; among ornamental stones are good specimens of white, yellow, and grey marble, and red, white, grey, and nearly black granite; and among paving stones, whitish sandstone found in large slabs.\n\n**Forests.**\u2014A great part of Rew\u00e1 K\u00e1ntha is covered with forest. The chief trees are mahu\u00e1 (Bassia latifolia), teak, blackwood (Dalbergia Sissoo), tamarind, mango, r\u00e1yan (Mimusops indica), s\u00e1dado (Terminalia Arjuna), beheda (Terminalia belerica), timbarrun (Carissa carandas), bili (\u00c6gle Marmelos), kher (Acacia Catechu), etc. The forest reserves are of two kinds\u2014State reserves, or tracts in the large forests where the State only can cut; and sacred village groves, where the finest timber is found. Most of the villages have two kinds of groves\u2014one never cut except on emergencies, and the other less sacred and generally felled at intervals of 30 years. Except for wants of the State, or when the villagers are forced to make good losses caused by some general fire or flood, the fear of the guardian spirit keeps the people from cutting in their village groves. The forests were once famous for their large stores of high-class timber. But of late years, from the stricter conservancy in the neighbouring Panch Mah\u00e1ls District, they have been greatly cut down, and few large trees are now left.\n\n**Fauna.**\u2014Tigers and leopards, though yearly becoming fewer, are still found in considerable number. Bears and wild hog are common. S\u00e1mbhar, spotted deer, and nil-gai are found over great part of the Agency; bison (Bos gav\u00e6us) in the extreme south-east. The painted and common sand-grouse, red spur-fowl, the pea-fowl, the painted and grey partridge, and quail are common. Common, jack, and\npainted snipe, black goose, cotton, whistling, common, and blue-winged teal are some of the water-fowls. The stores of fish in the larger rivers are made little use of. So great is the influence of the higher class of Hindus, that professional fishermen can practise their calling only by stealth.\n\n**History.**\u2014Under the first Anhilw\u00e1ra dynasty (746\u2013942), almost all the Rew\u00e1 K\u00e1ntha lands were under the government of the B\u00e1rias, that is, Koli and Bhil chiefs. In the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries, driven south and east by the pressure of Muhammadan invasion, chiefs of R\u00e1jput or part R\u00e1jput blood took the place of the Kol\u00ed and Bh\u00edl leaders. The first established was the house of the R\u00e1ja of R\u00e1jpipla. In the 16th century, the Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d Sult\u00e1ns brought under submission almost the whole of Rew\u00e1 K\u00e1ntha. In the 17th century, although a member of the B\u00e1bi family founded the State of B\u00e1l\u00e1sinor, the power of the Gujar\u00e1t (Guzer\u00e1t) viceroys began to decline. The Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s soon spread their authority over the plains, and collected tribute with the help of military force.\n\nThe younger branches of the chiefs\u2019 families had from time to time been forced to leave their homes and win for themselves new States; and these, with the descendants of a few of the original chiefs, form the present landholders of the small estates of the Agency. Under the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, they plundered the country; and as the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r failed to keep order, the British had to undertake the task. In 1821, an agreement was concluded with the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r, under which the control of all the Baroda tributaries was vested in the Company. In 1825, the petty chiefs of P\u00e1ndu Mew\u00e1s came under British control. At the same time, the political control of Sindhia\u2019s Panch Mah\u00e1ls was made over to the Company, and B\u00e1riya State was transferred from the Bhop\u00e1war Agency, Central India. The Political Agency of Rew\u00e1 K\u00e1ntha was established in 1826, to take charge of these territories. The States of Lun\u00e1w\u00e1ra and Sunth, which had been under British control since 1819, were afterwards transferred from the Mahi K\u00e1ntha Agency. In 1829, the appointment of Political Agent was abolished, and the chiefs were left very much to themselves.\n\nIn 1842, the Political Agency at Rew\u00e1 K\u00e1ntha was re-established, and the criminal powers of the chiefs were classified. In 1853, the State of B\u00e1l\u00e1sinor was transferred from the Kaira Collector; and Sindhia handed over for a period of ten years the administration of the Godra Panch Mah\u00e1ls. In 1862, the Panch Mah\u00e1ls were exchanged by Sindhia for country near Gwalior, and became British territory. Two years later, the Panch Mah\u00e1ls were removed from the control of the Agent, and formed into a separate charge. In 1876, the Panch Mah\u00e1ls were raised to the rank of a District, the officer in charge of it having control of the Rew\u00e1 K\u00e1ntha States.\nOf the 61 States of Rew\u00e1 K\u00e1ntha, one, R\u00e1jpipla, is of the first class and is the most important and the largest of all. Its chief has been granted power of life and death, and can try British subjects, but all the other chiefs are required to remit cases against such persons to the Political Agent. Five chiefs, Chhota Udaipur, B\u00e1riya, Sunth, Lun\u00e1w\u00e1ra, and B\u00e1l\u00e1sinor, are of the second class, and have independent control within their own States. The 55 small States include Kad\u00e1na and Sanjeli (both of whom pay no tribute), and three groups of Mew\u00e1s States. Sankheda Mew\u00e1s consists of 26 States; area, 311 square miles; population (1881) 53,214; revenue, \u00a319,200. P\u00e1ndu Mew\u00e1s consists of 22 States; area, 138 square miles; population (1881) 20,312; revenue, \u00a34700. Dorka Mew\u00e1s consists of 3 States; area, 9 square miles; population (1881) 4576; revenue, \u00a31100. Of the 61 States at the close of 1883-84, 16 were under the direct management of the Agency; the chiefs of three of these were minors.\n\nPopulation.\u2014Until 1872, the Rew\u00e1 K\u00e1ntha people had never been enumerated. The Census of 1872 showed a total population of 505,732; and the Census of 1881, 543,452, namely, 280,208 males and 263,244 females, occupying 109,730 houses, in 3 towns and 1101 villages. Average density of population, 113\u00b74 persons per square mile; number of houses per square mile, 24\u00b79; number of villages and towns per square mile, 0\u00b723; number of inhabitants per house, 4\u00b795. Hindus number 368,069; Muhammadans, 21,401; aboriginal tribes, 152,720; Jains, 1040; P\u00e1rs\u00eds, 220; and Christians, 2.\n\nThe Hindus are sub-divided according to caste into Br\u00e1hmans, 19,537; R\u00e1jputs, 20,478; Cham\u00e1rs, 4622; Darz\u00eds, 1460; N\u00e1pits, 3193; Kunb\u00eds, 30,251; Kumbh\u00e1rs, 3750; Loh\u00e1rs, 3121; Mh\u00e1rs, 15,102; Sut\u00e1rs, 2396; other Hindus, 264,159. According to sect, the Muhammadans are returned as follows:\u2014Sunn\u00eds 19,882, and Shi\u00e1s 1519.\n\nOf the total population, persons following agricultural occupations or having interest in land number 240,058; and artisans, 24,680. Of the remaining 278,714 inhabitants, 12,623 carry on other miscellaneous callings, and 266,091 are returned as without occupation; this number represented children under age and females who perform no regular work other than household.\n\nThe Bhils are found in large numbers, especially in the south-east of Rew\u00e1 K\u00e1ntha. The Rew\u00e1 K\u00e1ntha Bhil is generally of middle size, strong-limbed, muscular, and wonderfully active and dirty. As regards dress, the Bhils and Kolis are divided into two classes\u2014potadi\u00e1s or waist-cloth wearers, and langot\u00ed\u00e1s or loin-cloth wearers. The former, besides a waist-cloth, wear a short coat, and a turban generally white, but sometimes red. A few, instead of the waist-cloth, wear short drawers reaching to their knees. A Bhil woman usually wears a coarse\nsari, a large petticoat, and a cheap bodice. Most of the Bhils are cultivators, but their scanty crops do not suffice to support them for more than three or four months. During the rest of the year they depend on the sale of forest produce, timber, mahua flower, honey, wax, and lac. The Bhils are truthful, thriftless, superstitious, and fond of drink. They are wanting in forethought. As a rule, they live from hand to mouth, and are deeply indebted to the village trader, seldom receiving the full value of their labour and produce. Such is the Bhil's love of spirits, that their religious and social rites almost always end in a great debauch.\n\nA Bhil's religion consists largely of a belief in charms. They worship female deities, known as matis, represented by symbols, rather than images, by wooden posts, toy horses, earthen pots, wicker baskets, and winnowing fans. They believe in witches and in the evil eye. They have their wise men called barwas, exorcists, whose office is hereditary, and who are in special request during an epidemic.\n\nThe Bhils have peculiar marriage customs. Sometimes the young couple arrange matters unknown to their parents. They disappear, and after hiding for some days in the forest, come back and declare themselves man and wife. The parents, as a rule, accept the situation; and after arranging the expenses (\u00a36 to \u00a38), the marriage is celebrated with the usual forms. If the matter is not quietly settled, a feud runs on between the families. Sometimes a woman boldly walks into the house of the man she wishes to marry, and declares that he is her husband. Should he be willing, she sends for the father, and giving \u00a36 to \u00a38, asks his consent. If the man is unwilling, he is in no way forced to make the woman his wife. If a Bhil wishes to marry, and is unable to pay the wedding expenses, he contracts to serve his future father-in-law as a serf for a certain number of years, at the end of which he is entitled to the girl's hand, and to have all marriage expenses paid for him. During this period of servitude, he and the girl live as man and wife. Polygamy is allowed. Divorce is, as a rule, easily granted.\n\nThe Kolis are divided into 21 tribes, belonging to two great subdivisions, Talabda and Khant, so distinct that marriages between them are forbidden. The R\u00e1thwa Kol\u00eds, originally settlers from R\u00e1th in Al\u00ed R\u00e1jpur of Bhop\u00e1war Agency, Central India, are found chiefly in the States of B\u00e1riya and Chhota Udaipur. They live in the forests and do not settle long in one place, moving from one tract to another, growing crops on clearing in the jungle. In their habits and ways of living they resemble the Bhils. The Talabda Kol\u00eds, who think themselves superior to the other class, do not eat beef nor the flesh of any animal that has died a natural death. Most of the Kol\u00eds are cultivators, but idle and unskilful. Nearly as thriftless as the Bhils, they are deeply indebted to the village trader, who, leaving them grain\nenough for food, seed, and rent, takes the rest. They are cleanly in their habits, and not so simple as the Bhils. Both tribes are inveterate thieves; but the Kol\u00eds lay their plans with much more method, boldness, and cunning than the Bhils. They lie freely. The Kol\u00eds are less superstitious, and pay more respect to ceremonial observances. They worship all the Hindu gods, but chiefly Indra and H\u00e1mal. They respect Br\u00e1hmans, and employ them to conduct their religious ceremonies.\n\nPolygamy is allowed among the Kol\u00eds. When a Kol\u00ed wishes to get his son married, he generally, although the marriage may have been arranged long before, goes through the form of starting off to find a bride. After he has chosen a bride, and made all the preliminary arrangements, he is asked to dine with her father. During the dinner, the women of the bride's family strew grains of corn on the threshold, and as the boy's father is leaving the house, they rush at him as if to beat him, and he, making for the door, slips and falls. The boy's father's fall on the threshold of the girl's house is so important an omen that without it no marriage could prosper. Among Kol\u00eds, when a man dies leaving a widow, it is usual for his younger brother to marry her. But if she wishes to marry some one else, she can do so if her future husband pays back to the younger brother her deceased husband's marriage expenses. The Kol\u00eds burn their dead.\n\nTrade.\u2014The trade of Rew\u00e1 K\u00e1ntha resembles in many respects that of the Panch Mah\u00e1ls. Both have a through traffic between Gujar\u00e1t and Central India, and a local trade west with Gujar\u00e1t and east with R\u00e1jput\u00e1na, Central India, and Kh\u00e1ndesh. While the opening of the railway through Gujar\u00e1t has increased the local trade westwards, the through trade has dwindled, the old direct routes with their rough roads and heavy dues failing to compete with the easy railway journey by Bombay and Kh\u00e1ndesh to Central India.\n\nAdministration.\u2014Civil courts have only lately been introduced into Rew\u00e1 K\u00e1ntha. Disputes were formerly settled by arbitration, and money-lenders were allowed to recover their outstanding debts as they best could. As regards criminal justice, the Rew\u00e1 K\u00e1ntha authorities consist of th\u00e1n\u00e1d\u00edrs, with second and third class magisterial powers in the estates of the petty Mew\u00e1s chiefs; the chiefs of Kad\u00e1na, Sanjeli, Bh\u00e1darwa, Um\u00e9ta, B\u00e1ria, B\u00e1lasinor, and R\u00e1jpipla; the Assistant Political Agent, and the Political Agent. No regular police is provided for the Mew\u00e1s States, and the work is performed by the troopers of the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r's Contingent, who are stationed at the principal places. They carry the post, convey prisoners, and do miscellaneous work. The larger States maintain a police force of their own. Advantage was taken of several of the States being under management during the minority of their chiefs, to establish a system of federal police. But\nthe system had to be given up as each chief succeeded to his inheritance. In 1883-84, the strength of the police employed by the large States was 1023, of whom 116 were mounted. In the 27 prisons, 1999 prisoners were confined. The number of schools in 1883-84 was 71 for boys, with 5278 pupils; and 5 for girls, with 222 scholars. There are four libraries in the States of the Agency, and a printing press at N\u00e1ndod for State purposes only. The average daily attendance at the 7 dispensaries was 387 in 1883-84.\n\nRew\u00e1ri.\u2014North-western tahsil of Gurg\u00e1on District, Punjab; consisting of an outlying hilly tract, almost separated from the remainder of the District by native territory. The soil is naturally sandy; but the industry of the Ah\u00edr inhabitants, and the copious well-irrigation, have turned it into a singularly prosperous country. Numerous streams flow through it from the Jaipur hills, the principal of which are the S\u00e1h\u00edbi and the H\u00e1nsaot\u00ed. Area, 426 square miles; towns and villages, 285; number of houses, 23,558, namely, occupied 16,211, and unoccupied 7347. Total population (1881) 142,555, namely, males 75,092, and females 67,463; average density, 334 persons per square mile. Classified according to religion, the population consists of\u2014Hindus, 123,525; Muhammadans, 18,007; Jains, 985; Sikhs, 18; and Christians, 20. Of the 285 towns and villages, 215 contain less than five hundred inhabitants; 44 from five hundred to a thousand; and 25 from one to five thousand inhabitants. The only place with a population exceeding five thousand is Rew\u00e1ri town (23,972). The average annual area under crops for the five years 1877-78 to 1881-82 is returned at 234\u00bd square miles, or 149,958 acres, the principal crops being\u2014b\u00e1jra, 69,394 acres; moth, 53,429 acres; barley, 31,058 acres; jo\u00e1r, 12,817 acres; wheat, 7622 acres; and vegetables, 3813 acres. Revenue of the tahsil, \u00a326,182. The administrative staff consists of a tahsild\u00e1r, a munsif, and an honorary magistrate, who preside over 2 civil and 2 revenue courts. Number of police circles (th\u00e1nds), 3; strength of regular police, 127 men; village watch or rural police (chaukid\u00e1rs), 306.\n\nRew\u00e1ri.\u2014Town and municipality in Gurg\u00e1on District, Punjab, and head-quarters of Rew\u00e1ri tahsil; situated in lat. 28\u00b0 12' N., long. 70\u00b0 40' E., on the Delhi and Jaipur road, 32 miles south-east of Gurg\u00e1on town, at the junction of the Rew\u00e1ri-Firozpur and R\u00e1jput\u00e1na-M\u00e1lw\u00e1 lines of railway. Rew\u00e1ri is an ancient town, but owes its present commercial importance to British rule. The d\u00e9bris of an earlier city cover a site known as Budhi Rew\u00e1ri, east of the modern walls. Local tradition attributes its foundation to R\u00e1j\u00e1 Karm P\u00e1l, of unknown date. Even the present town has considerable antiquity, having been founded about 1000 A.D. by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Reo, who named it after his daughter Rew\u00e1ti. The native R\u00e1j\u00e1s seem to have maintained a partial independence under the\nMughal Empire, renting their *pargan\u00e1* at a fixed revenue. They also built the fort of Gokalgarh, near the town, now in ruins, but exhibiting marks of great strength. They coined their own money, one of the most cherished prerogatives of independent sovereignty in India, and their currency bore the name of Gokal Sikka.\n\nOn the collapse of the Mughal Empire, Rew\u00e1ri fell first to the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s and afterwards to the J\u00e1t R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Bhartpur, who retained it till the cession of the Delhi territory in 1803. In 1805, the *pargan\u00e1* was brought under direct British rule, and the town became for some time the head-quarters of a District. A military cantonment was established at Bhar\u00e1was near the civil station till 1816, when the troops were transferred to Nas\u00edr\u00e1b\u00e1d, and the civil head-quarters removed to Gurg\u00e1on town. The security of British rule attracted large numbers of traders from the neighbouring Native States, for which Rew\u00e1ri formed a central emporium. The Rew\u00e1ri estate was taken from the chief of Bhartpur in 1805, and made over in farm to Tej Singh, whose descendants held this position till the Mutiny, although much impoverished by family quarrels, litigation, and extravagance. In 1857, R\u00e1o Tula R\u00e1m, grandson of Tej Singh, represented the family; and he, on the outbreak of the disturbances, assumed the government of Rew\u00e1ri, collected revenue, cast guns, and raised a force with which he kept the turbulent Meos in check, without, however, casting in his lot with the British or actually joining the rebels. Finally, on the advance of a British force from Delhi, he and his cousin Gop\u00e1l Deo fled on receiving a summons to the camp. Both died as fugitives, and the estate was confiscated.\n\nRew\u00e1ri town lies low, and in 1873 was partially inundated by an overflow from the S\u00e1hibi river, whose ordinary course is seven miles from the town; but it is well drained, and secure from all but very unusual floods. Population (1881) 23,972, namely, males 11,824, and females 12,148. Hindus number 14,687; Muhammadans, 8499; Jains, 763; Sikhs, 10; and Christians, 13. Number of houses, 2806. Municipal income (1883-84), \u00a33764, or an average of 3s. 2d. per head. The town is traversed from east to west by a broad and handsome street of shops constructed in 1864; and from north to south by several good roads, terminating on each side with a fine gateway. The houses and shops along the main streets are all of stone or brick, and many of them large, substantial, and of some architectural pretensions; outside the main streets, the thoroughfares are narrow and crooked, and the houses for the most part mud hovels. The chief streets and roads are well paved, lighted, and flanked with good surface drains; but the sanitary and conservancy arrangements in the bye-streets and lanes is still defective, although improvements are being rapidly carried on out of surplus municipal income. A circular drive, well\nmetalled, and shaded with an avenue of trees, surrounds the town. To the south-west is a handsome tank built by Rao Tej Singh, surrounded by temples, and bathing-places for both men and women, with stone staircases. Adjoining the tank, a large garden has been laid out as a public recreation ground. Another picturesque tank, surrounded by handsome mausoleums, is situated near the railway station. The principal buildings are the Government courts and offices, a handsome town hall, police station, post-office, large Government school, sar\u00e1\u00ed or native inn, and a dispensary.\n\nThe brass and pewter vessels of Rew\u00e1ri are celebrated. Together with fine turbans, they form the principal manufacture of the town. Rew\u00e1ri, indeed, was formerly a d\u00e9p\u00f4t for supplying a great part of R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. Since the opening of through communication by rail, Rew\u00e1ri no longer forms a regular halting-place between Delhi and the Native States, and the demand for its brass-ware has somewhat fallen off; but, on the other hand, an enormous trade in grain has from the same cause sprung up with distant parts of India. Situated as the town is, at the junction of two lines of railway, it cannot fail to increase steadily in commercial importance. Sugar is brought from Rohtak, the Do\u00e1b, and parts of Oudh, and exported westwards; while wheat, barley, and gram are collected from all the neighbouring country, and exported to Calcutta, Bombay, and Gujr\u00e1t, and much barley is purchased for the breweries of Masuri and Naini T\u00e1l. Iron is imported in large quantities from Alwar for use in the manufactures of the town; and iron, with salt, forms the return trade to the North-Western Provinces. There are several banking and commercial firms of considerable importance, whose dealings extend to Bombay, Calcutta, the Central Provinces, and the north and west Punjab.\n\nRew\u00e1s.\u2014Port in the Al\u00edb\u00e1gh Sub-division of Kol\u00e1ba District, Bombay Presidency. Lat. $18^\\circ 47' 20''$ N., long. $72^\\circ 58' 30''$ E.; 10 miles north-east of Al\u00edb\u00e1gh. Population (1881) 919, occupying 149 houses. Chiefly fishermen, who live in low dirty huts. The houses of the cultivators are better built and clean. Average annual value of trade for the four years ending 1881-82, \u00a38488\u2014namely, imports, \u00a32660, and exports, \u00a35828. In 1881-82 the value of imports was \u00a32060, and of exports, \u00a3412. Rew\u00e1s is one of the five ports of the Al\u00edb\u00e1gh Customs Division. Steamers from Bombay call daily at all states of the tide. Road communication with Alib\u00e1gh.\n\nRiah.\u2014Tahsil in Si\u00e1lkot District, Punjab.\u2014See Ray\u00e1.\n\nRian.\u2014Town in Jodhpur State, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na.\u2014See Rayan.\n\nRi\u00e1si.\u2014Fort and town in the Jamu Division of Kashm\u00edr State, Northern India. Lat. $33^\\circ 5' N.$, long. $74^\\circ 52' E.$; lies on the left bank of the Chen\u00e1b (Chin\u00e1b), on the last slopes of the southernmost Him\u00e1layan\nrange. Thornton states that the fort crowns a conical rock, south of the town, and consists of a rectangular enclosure, whose lofty stone walls rose sheer from the steeply escarped sides of the hills, with a bomb-proof tower at each angle. Two large tanks supply the garrison with water. A deep ravine separates the fort from a sandstone eminence of equal height, about a mile distant.\n\n**Ridhpur.**\u2014Town in Amraoti District, Berar.\u2014See RITPUR.\n\n**Rikheswar.**\u2014Cantonment in Kum\u00e1un District, North-Western Provinces.\u2014See LOHAGHAT.\n\n**Rintimbur.**\u2014Fort in Jaipur (Jeypore) State, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na.\u2014See RANTHAMBHOR.\n\n**Rioti.**\u2014Town in B\u00e1nsdih tahsil, Ballia District, North-Western Provinces.\u2014See REOTI.\n\n**Riot\u00edpur.**\u2014Town in Zam\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1 tahsil, Gh\u00e1z\u00edpur District, North-Western Provinces.\u2014See REOTIPUR.\n\n**Ripu.**\u2014One of the Dw\u00e1rs or submontane tracts forming the Eastern Dw\u00e1rs of Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1 District, Assam. Area, 242 square miles. Population (1881) 3040; forest area (reserved), 65\u00b705 square miles; area under cultivation, 4\u00b762 square miles. In 1870 the land was settled with the cultivators direct for a term of seven years. Since 1877 the settlement has been made on yearly leases, as in the rest of Assam.\n\n**Rishikund.**\u2014Hot spring in Monghyr District, Bengal. It has been made a place of worship; and a reservoir has been built to collect the water into one pool, which is about 140 feet square, and on the side most remote from the sources, overgrown with aquatic plants. The bottom of the pool is partly sandy, partly rocky; and the air-bubbles rise from the surface over a space of about 30 feet wide and 140 feet long. Where the air-bubbles issue from among sand, they form a small cavity like a crater. When Dr. Buchanan-Hamilton visited this spring he found, in the month of April, that the thermometer in the air stood at 72\u00b0 F.; in the water where it issued from the crevice of a rock, it rose to 110\u00b0; and in one of the craters, to 114\u00b0. A fair is held at Rishikund once in three years. It is of no great importance, there being seldom more than 2000 people present.\n\n**Risod.**\u2014Chief town of a pargan\u00e1 in Bas\u00edm t\u00e1luk, Bas\u00edm District, Berar; originally known as *Rishi-wud-kshetr*, or \u2018The place of all the Rishis.\u2019 Lat. 19\u00b0 58' 30\" N., long. 76\u00b0 51' E. Population (1867) 4716; not returned separately in the Census of 1881. Place of some commercial activity. In 1858\u201359, a plundering party of Rohill\u00e1s, being brought to bay by a detachment of the Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d (Hyder\u00e1b\u00e1d) Contingent at the walled village of Chichamba, near Risod, resisted an infantry attack. This was the last fight of the kind in Ber\u00e1r. Charitable dispensary; first class vernacular school; police station. Large irrigation tank.\nRitpur.\u2014Town in Morsi taluk, Amraoti District, Ber\u00e1r; 26 miles north of Amraoti town. Lat. $21^\\circ 14' N.$, long. $77^\\circ 52' E.$ Population (1881) 2538. Once a place of importance, having been the tankha j\u00e1gir of Sal\u00e1bat Kh\u00e1n. The stone wall which surrounded the town fifty years ago has almost entirely disappeared. It is said to have then had 12,000 inhabitants, many of whom deserted it owing to the oppression of Bisenchand, talukd\u00e1r in the time of N\u00e1md\u00e1r Kh\u00e1n. The principal buildings of interest are R\u00e1mchandra\u2019s temple, the M\u00e1nbh\u00e1u building called R\u00e1j Math, and the Government school. Good water is scarce at Ritpur, the people obtaining their drinking supply from L\u00e1l\u00e1\u2019s well.\n\nRitpur is the chief seat of the sect known as M\u00e1nbh\u00e1u, founded by Kishen Bh\u00e1t at Paithan (Niz\u00e1m\u2019s Dominions). Kishen Bh\u00e1t, the spiritual adviser of a R\u00e1j\u00e1 who ruled at Paithan about the middle of the fourteenth century, was made an outcaste on account of his marriage with a low-born woman (a Mh\u00e1ng). The name of Mh\u00e1ng-bh\u00e1u, which has been corrupted to the present M\u00e1nbh\u00e1u, and which he gave to his children, is derived from their mixed parentage. He promulgated a religious system which he disseminated far and wide by means of his sons. His doctrines repudiated a multiplicity of gods; and it appears probable that the hatred and contempt he endured arose from his endeavours to restore the monotheistic principle of Br\u00e1hmanism as taught in the Vedas. He inculcated the exclusive worship of Krishna, and taught his disciples to eat with none but the initiated, and to break off all former ties of caste and religion. The head of the sect is a Mahant, and with him are associated a number of priests. Its members are professed celibates, but this rule is by no means rigidly observed. Both men and women shave all hair from the head, and wear a black waistcloth, forming a kind of skirt, to show that, having devoted themselves to religion, they in their worldly conduct no longer recognise any distinction as to sex. They bury their dead. Kishen Bh\u00e1t, the founder of this sect, is said to have obtained a magic cap, by wearing which he assumed the likeness of Krishna. This cap was at last forcibly taken from him and burnt.\n\nThe Census Report of 1881 returned 4111 M\u00e1nbh\u00e1us in Berar, namely, 2193 males and 1918 females. Of the males 451 were of no occupation, and 1251 were beggars. Of the females 44\u00b76 per cent. followed no specified occupation, and 38\u00b79 per cent. were beggars. More than one-fifth of the male sex, and less than one-sixth of the female sex, were productively employed. Of these the great majority were engaged in agriculture. Eleven men and three women were sahukars; six men were carpenters; and 32 women were cotton-spinners, ginners, and thread-makers.\n\nRiwari.\u2014Tahsil and town in Gurg\u00e1on District, Punjab.\u2014See Rewari.\nRobertsganj.\u2014Southern tahsil of Mirzapur District, North-Western Provinces; consisting of the plateau north of the Kaimur range, the Son (Soane) valley, the belt of hilly jungle which bounds the Son valley to the south, together with the Singrauli plain beyond. This tract comprises the most varied and picturesque scenery in the District. Area, 2632 square miles, of which 435 square miles are cultivated. Population (1872) 173,540; (1881) 226,318, namely, males 113,975, and females 112,343. Increase of population since 1872, 52,778, or 30.4 per cent. in nine years. Classified according to religion, the population consists of\u2014Hindus, 217,892; Muhammadans, 8323; Christians, 88; and 'others,' 15.

Population (1881) 1161. The village and tahsil are named after Mr. W. Roberts, Collector of Mirzapur in 1846, and settlement officer of the District. The place is increasing in importance; and the improvement of the road connecting it with Ahaura station on the East Indian Railway is likely to benefit Robertsganj at the expense of other local trade centres farther north.\n\nRoha.\u2014Sub-division of Kolaba District, Bombay Presidency. Area, 200 square miles. Population (1872) 41,997; (1881) 44,835, namely, 22,525 males and 22,310 females, occupying 8300 houses, in 1 town and 132 villages. Hindus number 42,302; Muhammadans, 1869; and 'others,' 664. Roha is for the most part hilly; and contains the rich valley of the Kundalika river. The rice lands are well watered during the rainy season, but in the cold and hot months the supply of drinking water is defective. In the hill slopes and uplands, the soil is a mixture of earth and broken trap. In the level parts the soil varies from reddish to yellow or black. During the 22 years ending 1881 the rainfall averaged 115.8 inches. The Sub-division contains altogether 61,666 acres of cultivable land, 12,007 acres of uncultivable land, 29,469 acres of forest reserves, and 402 acres under grass. Of the Government cultivable land (60,943 acres), 41,771 acres were\nin 1881\u201382 under actual cultivation, of which 955 acres were twice cropped.

The village of Ashtami, on the opposite bank of the river, is included within the municipal limits of Roha. In 1673, Oxenden called it Esthemy.\n\n**Rohar.**\u2014Chief seaport of Anj\u00e1r division, Cutch, Bombay Presidency. Situated about 12 miles east of Anj\u00e1r town. In 1818 the port was able to receive vessels of 70 tons, and had a hard sandy beach over which carts could pass close to the sea. Now only small boats do an insignificant coasting trade. A petty fort falling into decay. The water-supply has been improved by building a new reservoir.\n\n**Rohilkhand.**\u2014Division or Commissionership under the jurisdiction of the Lieutenant-Governor of the North-Western Provinces, lying between 27\u00b0 35' and 29\u00b0 58' N. lat., and between 78\u00b0 2' and 80\u00b0 28' E. long.

The last enumeration in 1881 disclosed a total of 5,122,557, showing a decrease of 129,768, or 2\u00bd per cent., in nine years. This decrease is attributable to the famine caused by drought in 1877\u201378, and to severe outbreaks of epidemic fever in 1878\u201379. The results of the Census of 1881 may be summarized as follows:\u2014Area of Division, 10,883 square miles, with 46 towns and 11,281 villages; number of houses, 639,604.

Head-quarters at M\u00edrpur.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The Sub-division consists mainly of a desert known as the Reg\u00edst\u00e1n, constituting a portion of the vast plain of Shik\u00e1rpur. It is broken by sandhills, which are often bold in outline, and fairly wooded. A small limestone range in the south-west of the Sub-division runs from near Rohri town due north and south into Khairpur. The Indus is supposed to have once flowed past these hills near the ancient town of Aror, and to have been diverted into its present channel through the Bakhar Hills by some great natural convulsion. The Ren, said to be a former bed of the main stream of the Indus, is in the Reg\u00edst\u00e1n. The principal canals in Rohri are\u2014the new supply channel for the Eastern N\u00e1ra, 13 miles long and 156 feet wide at its mouth, with strong sluice-gates; the Eastern N\u00e1ra in its course towards the south is cut up into numerous small streams, and abounds in quagmires and quicksands: the L\u00fandi, 16 miles long; Aror, 16 miles; Dahr, 26 miles; Mas\u00fa, 32 miles; Korai, 23 miles; Mah\u00e1ro, 37 miles; Dengro, 16 miles.

The forests of Rohri cover an area of 137 square miles; the most important trees are the pipal (Ficus religiosa), nim (Melia Azadirachta), ber (Zizyphus jujuba), siras (Dalbergia latifolia), tali (Dalbergia Sissoo), bahan (Populus euphratica), and kandi (Prosopis spicigera). The bush jungle consists for the most part of tamarisk. Game is abundant.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The total population of Rohri Sub-division in 1872 was returned at 217,515, of whom 176,789 were Muhammadans, 37,917 Hindus, 1853 Bhils, 134 Sikhs, and 822 \u2018others.\u2019 In 1881 it was returned, including a part of Kohist\u00e1n, at 209,114, namely, 111,799 males and 97,315 females; occupying 41,167 houses, in 3 towns and 344 villages. Hindus numbered 27,499; Muhammadans, 167,915; Sikhs, 8888; Christians, 109; P\u00e1rs\u00eds, 1; and aboriginal tribes, 4792. Average density of population, 38\u00b76 persons per square mile. The inhabitants of the Reg\u00edst\u00e1n are a strong, active, and temperate race. The chief towns are Rohri, Ghotki, and M\u00edrpur. Eight fairs are held in the Sub-division, 5 in the Rohri, and 3 in the Ghotki t\u00e1luk, with an attendance varying from 1000 to 3000 people. The towns of Rohri, Ghotki, M\u00edrpur, Ubauro, and Pano Akil contain travellers\u2019 bungalows. The principal antiquities are the ruined town and fort of Aror, and the old stronghold of Mathelo, which is situated on rising ground about 45 miles north-east of Rohri town, and is said to have been founded by a R\u00e1jput about 1400 years ago. About 2\u00bd miles from Rohri are the ruins of an ancient town called Hakrah, built on the extremity of a\nrocky hill, which appears to have been gradually covered by the mud from the flood-waters of the Indus, that even now flow over the spot. During the construction of the Sind, Punjab, and Delhi Railway, the ruins of the old Hindu city of Veujnot were discovered. The ruins are about 2 miles from the village and railway station of Reti, on the banks of the Ren, which is supposed to have been formerly the main channel of the Indus.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Two crops are raised in Rohri, viz.\u2014the kharif, sown between March and July, and reaped between July and December, which includes cotton, jo\u00e1r (Sorghum vulgare), b\u00e1jra (Pennisetum typhoideum), indigo, rice, oil-seeds, vegetables, etc.; and the rabi, sown between November and March, and reaped in March and April, comprising wheat, gram, dhaniya (coriander), tobacco, wheat, rice, and barley. Jo\u00e1r and b\u00e1jra form the staple articles of food. Of the total area, only 144,832 acres are under cultivation. Fruits and vegetables are extensively grown. Irrigation is carried on by means of canals, which have already been enumerated. The floods of the Indus, or l\u00e9tis, as they are called, are also a source of fertility; but when excessive, they cause great destruction to land and crops. Protective embankments have been erected in several villages. The fiscal settlement of the Sub-division was begun in 1856\u201357, but not completed till 1871\u201372. The revised settlement was introduced into the Rohri t\u00e1luk in 1881\u201382 for ten years, while the original settlement is still current in the other t\u00e1luks of the Sub-division. The average rate per acre assessed on cultivable land is Rs. 3. 10. (7s. 3d.) in Rohri t\u00e1luk; Rs. 1. 12. (3s. 6d.) in M\u00edrpur t\u00e1luk; Rs. 2. 10. (5s. 3d.) in Ghotki t\u00e1luk; and Rs. 2. 4. (4s. 6d.) in Ubauro. The principal tenure is the maur\u00edsi, under which the tenants possess a right of occupancy. The zamind\u00e1ri system also prevails to some extent. Land is held in j\u00e1gir in every t\u00e1luk, but the largest area is found in that of Rohri, viz. 31,000 acres. In connection with the j\u00e1girs must be mentioned the Sayyids of Bakhar and Rohri, who have held lands in gift in this Sub-division from about 1290 A.D. Additional grants were made to them in 1712, by Jah\u00e1ndar Sh\u00e1h. The conditions on which the Sayyids held their territory seem to have been, (1) to pray for their imperial masters, and (2) to guard the country from marauders. The privileges of the Sayyids were confirmed by the Kalhora sovereigns, but Mir Sohr\u00e1b Kh\u00e1n Talpur commuted their land assessments and remissions for a fourth share of the revenue alienated to the grantees.\n\nManufactures, etc.\u2014Pottery, coarse cloth, and lime are the chief manufactures of the Sub-division. The annual quantity of lime made is estimated at 25,000 maunds, or about 900 tons. The towns of Ghotki and Khairpur Dharki are noted for their manufacture of pipe-bowls, snuff-boxes, scissors, and cooking-pots. The most important exports\nfrom Rohri are grain, fuller's earth, lime, oil, wool, fruits, silk cloth, and indigo. The imports are wheat, sugar, tobacco, ghi, metals, cotton cloth, salt, and shoes. The Sub-division also carries on a considerable transit trade in grain, sugar, molasses, wool, wine, iron bars and pots, and cotton. The total length of roads is 400 miles. The main trunk road is that which connects Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d with M\u00falt\u00e1n. There are 25 ferries in Rohri Sub-division, of which 22 are on the Indus and 3 on the N\u00e1r\u00e1. The Sind, Punjab, and Delhi (now the North-Western State) Railway traverses the Sub-division, with nine stations\u2014Rohri, Sangi, Pano Akil, Mahaser, Ghotki, Sirhad, M\u00edrpur, Khairpur Dharki, and Rehti.\n\nRevenue.\u2014The imperial revenue in 1873\u201374 amounted to \u00a337,966; and in 1881\u201382 to \u00a335,864, of which \u00a333,250 was derived from the land-tax, \u00a31171 from excise, \u00a31443 from stamps, and \u00a359 from fines and fees. The local revenue was \u00a33710, derived from cesses on land and sayer revenue, fisheries, cattle pound, and ferry funds. The gross revenue was therefore \u00a339,574. There is a special civil officer for the Sub-division, and a subordinate judge, who holds his court at Ghotki. The administration is carried on by an Assistant Collector with full magisterial powers. The total number of police is 248 men, or 1 to every 843 of the population. In 1881\u201382 there were 22 Government schools, with 1147 pupils, including one school for girls at Rohri town. The Sub-division contains three municipalities, Rohri, Ubauro, and Ghotki; their aggregate receipts in 1883\u201384 amounted to \u00a31828; the incidence of taxation per head of population varied from 8d. to 2s. 6d.\n\nClimate.\u2014The transition from the hot to the cold season is very sudden in Rohri. The average rainfall registered during twenty years ending 1881 was 5'6 inches. The prevalent diseases are fevers, ague, rheumatism, and dysentery.\n\nRohri.\u2014T\u00e1luk of Rohri Sub-division, Shik\u00e1rpur District, Sind, Bombay Presidency. Area, 1550 square miles. Including a portion (1135 square miles) of Kohist\u00e1n, the Census Report of 1881 returned the population at 68,582, namely, 36,331 males and 32,251 females; occupying 14,623 houses, in 1 town and 66 villages. Hindus number 9753; Muhammadans, 51,643; Sikhs, 6393; aboriginal tribes, 723; Christians, 69; and P\u00e1rs\u00ed, 1. The t\u00e1luk contained in 1882\u201383\u2014criminal courts, 2; police circles (th\u00e1nd\u00e1s), 11; regular police, 63 men. Revenue (1882\u201383), \u00a311,691. In 1882\u201383 the area assessed to land revenue was 35,362 acres; the area actually cultivated, 32,897 acres.\n\nRohri.\u2014Town in Shik\u00e1rpur District, Sind, Bombay Presidency; situated in lat. 27\u00b0 42' N., and long. 68\u00b0 56' E., upon the right or west bank of the Indus, on a rocky eminence of limestone interspersed with flints. Population (1881) 10,224, namely, 5361 males and 4863 females. Hindus number 3097; Muhammadans, 4882; Christians, 69;\nP\u00e1rs\u00ed, 1; and aboriginal tribes, 2175. The Hindus, who are mostly of\nthe Baniy\u00e1 caste, are engaged in trade, banking, and money-lending,\nwhile the Muhammadans are chiefly of the K\u00e1zi, Sayyid, Bhuta, Kori,\nPatoli, Muh\u00e1na, Khati, Memon, Shaik, and Shik\u00e1ri tribes.\n\nRohri is said to have been founded by Sayyid Rukand\u00edn Sh\u00e1h in\n1297. The rocky site terminates abruptly on the west in a precipice 40\nfeet high, rising from the bank of the river, which during the inunda-\ntion season attains a height of about 16 feet above its lowest level. On\nthe northern side is the mouth of the new supply channel for the N\u00e1ra\n(EASTERN) (q.v.), 156 feet wide, which is provided with powerful sluice-\ngates to regulate the supply of water, as required.\n\nRohri, when seen from a little distance, has a striking and pleasing\nappearance, the houses being lofty, frequently four and five storeys\nhigh, with flat roofs surrounded by balustrades; some are of burnt\nbrick, erected many years ago by wealthy merchants belonging to the\nplace. But the streets are in several parts very narrow, and the air\nclose and unwholesome. Rohri has road communication with M\u00edrpur,\nKand\u00e1r, and Sangr\u00e1r, and the main trunk road from Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d to\nM\u00falt\u00e1n also passes through it. The town has derived a new importance\nas the station where the North-Western State Railway (formerly the\nSind, Punjab, and Delhi) crosses the Indus. The passage is at present\neffected by steam ferries; but the magnificent iron bridge now under\nconstruction (1886) will complete the line between Kar\u00e1chi and\nCalcutta, via Lahore and Delhi. The chief public buildings are the\nm\u00edkhti\u00e1rk\u00e1r's court, municipal commissioners' office, dispensary, police\nstation, travellers' rest-house, Government schools, post-office, and cattle\npound. The police force for the protection of the town numbers 10\nmen.\n\nRohri has a large number of Muhammadan places of worship. One,\nknown as the Jam\u00e1 Masjid, was built in 1564 by Fateh Kh\u00e1n, a lieu-\ntenant of the Emperor Akbar; it is a massive but gloomy pile of red\nbrick, covered with three domes, and coated with glazed porcelain tiles.\nThe other, the Idgah Masjid, was erected in 1593 by M\u00edr Musan Sh\u00e1h.\nThe War Mub\u00e1rak, a building about 25 feet square, situated to the\nnorth of the town, was erected about 1545 by M\u00edr Muhammad, the\nreigning Kalhora prince, for the reception of a hair from the beard of\nMuhammad. This hair, to which miraculous properties are ascribed\nby the faithful, is set in amber, which again is enclosed in a gold case\nstudded with rubies and emeralds, the gift of M\u00edr Al\u00ed Mur\u00e1d of\nKhairpur. The relic is exposed to view every March, when the hair is\nmade by some mechanical process to rise and fall, a fact which the\ndevotees are led to believe proceeds from supernatural agency.\n\nRohri possesses a municipality, established in 1855, and the town\nhas, in consequence, been greatly improved both as regards health and\nappearance. The municipal income in 1883-84 amounted to \u00a31,487; the incidence of taxation per head of population, 2s. 6d. The trade is principally in grain, oil, gh\u00ed, salt, fuller's earth, lime, and fruits. Tasar silk is manufactured, as well as gold and silver bracelets, and other ornaments. Paper of an indifferent quality is also made; but, as a whole, the manufactures are unimportant. Opposite to Rohri on the Indus is the small island of Khw\u00e1ja Khizr, containing the shrine of a saint who is revered alike by Muhammadans and Hindus.\n\nRohtak.\u2014District in the Lieutenant-Governorship of the Punjab, lying between 28\u00b0 19' and 29\u00b0 17' N. lat., and between 76\u00b0 17' and 77\u00b0 30' E. long. Area, 1811 square miles. Population (1881) 553,609. Rohtak forms the south-eastern District of the Hiss\u00e1r Division, and is situated on the confines of R\u00e1jput\u00e1na, beyond the southern boundary of the Punjab proper. It is bounded on the north by J\u00ednd (Jhind) State and Karn\u00e1l District; on the east by Delhi and Gurg\u00e1on Districts; on the south by Gurg\u00e1on District, Pataudi and Duj\u00e1na States; and on the west by Hiss\u00e1r District and J\u00ednd State. Rohtak stands twenty-seventh in order of area, and nineteenth in order of population among the 32 Districts of the Punjab. It comprises 170 per cent. of the total area, and 294 per cent. of the total population of the Province. It contains little more than half the average area of a Punjab District; but in extent of cultivation it ranks eighth, and in amount of revenue sixth, among the Districts of the Province. It is divided into four tahsils, of which Goh\u00e1na comprises the northern, Jhajjar the southern, Sampl\u00e1 the east central, and Rohtak the west central portion of the District. At the point of junction of Jhajjar, Sampl\u00e1, and Rohtak tahsils are situated the two estates of Duj\u00e1na and Mahrana, comprising an area of 11\u00bd square miles, which form a portion of the territory of Duj\u00e1na State, although completely surrounded by Rohtak villages. The administrative head-quarters of the District are at the town of ROHTAK, on the main road from Delhi to Hiss\u00e1r.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The District of Rohtak lies in the midst of the level table-land separating the Jumna (Jamun\u00e1) and Sutlej (Satlaj) valleys, and is one of the few Punjab Districts which nowhere abuts on any one of the great rivers. Its surface is one unbroken plain, consisting of a hard clay, interspersed with light yellow sand, and covered in its wild state by a jungle of scrubby brushwood. Towards the south-west, the proportion of sand increases as the plain approaches the confines of the desert; but in the remainder of the District, cultivation has probably reached its utmost limit. Eastward, the land falls gradually towards the Delhi frontier, becoming low and swampy in the neighbourhood of the Najafgarh j\u00edil, a marshy lake which forms the only natural reservoir for the drainage of the District. This j\u00edil\nitself lies within the boundaries of Delhi; but the Sahibi, a little n\u00edla flowing from the Ajmere (Ajmir) Hills, traverses a corner of Rohtak, and is the solitary stream of which the District can boast. During the rainy season it throws off numerous smaller watercourses, which irrigate and occasionally flood the surrounding country. The Rohtak and But\u00e1na branches of the Western Jumna Canal supply water to the northern parg\u00e1n\u00e1s, but the greater portion of the central plain is entirely dependent upon the uncertain rainfall. So absolutely level is the surface, that rain sinks in as it falls; and it is only by artificial means that the water can be enticed into the tanks which have been rudely excavated in the neighbourhood of every village. Their origin is of immemorial antiquity, and their pleasant fringe of trees and brushwood forms a characteristic feature in the otherwise monotonous landscape. The only exception to the general flatness is to be found on a part of the Gurg\u00e1on boundary, where a few low rocky hills crop up above the barren and sandy levels of the south-eastern angle. Game is plentiful, including wild hog, deer, and hare. Peafowl, partridge, and small birds are to be met with throughout the year; and during the cold season, wild geese, bustards, and flamingoes swell the list. Wolves are still common, and a stray leopard is occasionally killed.\n\nHistory.\u2014Rohtak was formerly included within the undefined boundaries of the region which bore the name of Hari\u00e1na. The town of Mahim appears to have been its most important centre in early years, and is said to have been destroyed by Shah\u00e1b-ud-d\u00edn Ghori, but restored in 1266. Little can be ascertained, however, with reference to its annals before the year 1718, when the whole of Hari\u00e1na was granted by the Emperor Farukhsiyy\u00e1r to his minister, Rukhan-ud-daul\u00e1. The courtier made over his title in turn to a Bal\u00fach noble, Faujd\u00e1r Kh\u00e1n, who was created Naw\u00e1b of Farukhnagar in 1732. The Naw\u00e1b\u2019s dominions embraced the present Districts of Hiss\u00e1r and Rohtak, besides part of Gurg\u00e1on and a considerable region since annexed by the Sikh chieftains of J\u00ednd and Pati\u00e1la. Faujd\u00e1r Kh\u00e1n handed down his possessions to his son, who held them with varying fortunes till his death in 1760. That date coincides with the final collapse of the decaying empire, being the year in which Alamg\u00edr was murdered, and the titular Emperor Sh\u00e1h Alam ascended the throne of Delhi. His rule hardly extended beyond the city walls, and a period of anarchy set in. The next year saw the crushing defeat of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s at P\u00e1n\u00edpat, after which the Sikh adventurers began to change their policy from mere predatory incursions to conquest and settlement. The new Naw\u00e1b of Farukhnagar found his title from the first purely nominal; and in 1762 he was driven from his capital by the J\u00e1t leader, Jaw\u00e1har Singh of Bhartpur (Bhurtpore).\nFor the next twenty years, Hari\u00e1na passed through the usual vicissitudes of Upper India in this anarchic time: now the Naw\u00e1b recovered for a time his hereditary dominions; now Najaf Kh\u00e1n bestowed them on one of his followers; and now again the husband of Begam Sumru of Sardh\u00e1na (Walter Reinhardt) held part of them in fief. The Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s in 1785 put a stop for a while to these disorders; but even Sindhia was not able to repel the Sikh invasions, and in the end he was compelled to settle large portions of Hari\u00e1na on the Sikh rulers of Kaithal and Jind. Meanwhile the military adventurer George Thomas had carved out a principality for himself from the remainder, and fortified his position in two strongholds at Georgegarh near Jhajjar, and H\u00e1nsi in the District of Hiss\u00e1r. In 1802, the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, under their French generals, succeeded in ousting Thomas; but the conquests of Lord Lake, a year later, laid the whole country, up to the Sutlej and the Siw\u00e1liks, at the feet of the British Government. In fact, however, the supremacy of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s west of the Jumna, in its upper course, had been little more than nominal; and some time elapsed before any practical measures were taken in the cis-Sutlej and Hari\u00e1na regions.\n\nThe northern pargan\u00e1s of Rohtak were held by the Sikh chiefs of J\u00ednd and Kaithal, while the south was granted to the Naw\u00e1b of Jhajjar, the west to his brother the Naw\u00e1b of D\u00e1dri and Bah\u00e1durgarh, and the central tract to the Naw\u00e1b of Duj\u00e1na. The latter, however, was unable to maintain order in his portion of the territories thus assigned; and the frequent incursions of Sikh and Bhatti marauders compelled the despatch of an English officer in 1810, to bring the region into better organization. The few pargan\u00e1s thus subjected to British rule formed the nucleus of the present District. Other fringes of territory escheated on the deaths of the Kaithal R\u00e1j\u00e1 in 1818, and the chieftain of J\u00ednd in 1820. In the last-named year, Hiss\u00e1r and Sirsa were separated from Rohtak; and in 1824, the District of P\u00e1nipat (now Karn\u00e1l) was erected into a separate charge.\n\nUp to the year 1832, Rohtak was administered by a Political Agent under the Resident at Delhi; but it was then brought under the General Regulations, and annexed to the North-Western Provinces. On the outbreak of the Mutiny in 1857, Rohtak was for a time completely lost to the British Government. The Muhammadan tribes united with their brethren in Gurg\u00e1on and Hiss\u00e1r, and began a general predatory movement under the Naw\u00e1bs of Farukhnagar, Jhajjar, and Bah\u00e1durgarh, and the Bhatti chieftains of Sirsa and Hiss\u00e1r. They attacked and plundered the civil station at Rohtak, destroying every record of administration. But before the fall of Delhi, a force of Punjab levies was brought across the Sutlej, and order was restored with little difficulty. The rebel Naw\u00e1bs of Jhajjar and Bah\u00e1durgarh were captured and tried. The former was executed at Delhi, while his\nneighbour and relative escaped with a sentence of exile to Lahore. Their estates were confiscated, part of them being temporarily erected into a new District of Jhajjar, while other portions were assigned to the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of J\u00ednd, Pati\u00e1la, and N\u00e1bha, as rewards for their services during the Mutiny. Rohtak District was transferred to the Punjab Government; and in 1860, Jhajjar was broken up, part of it being added to the territory of the loyal R\u00e1j\u00e1s, and the remainder united with Rohtak.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The territorial changes which followed so fast during the middle of the present century make it impossible to give any accurate comparative statement of the population at different periods; but by adding and subtracting the official returns for the various fluctuating pargan\u00e1s at either date, an increase is found on the constant portion, between 1846 and 1868, amounting to 61 per cent. So great an advance in little more than twenty years is scarcely credible; yet we must allow a very rapid rate of growth, as the more accurate figures of the enumerations taken in 1853 and 1868 show an increase of 20 per cent. in fifteen years, which may be accepted as approximately correct. The Census of 1868 disclosed a total of 531,118. The last enumeration in 1881 returned the population of Rohtak District at 553,609, showing an increase of 22,491, or 4\u00b72 per cent., in thirteen years.\n\nThe general results of the Census of 1881 may be summarized as follows:\u2014Area of District, 1811 square miles; towns and villages, 486; number of houses, 118,330, namely, occupied 74,813, and unoccupied 43,517; number of families, 553,609. Total population, 553,609, namely, males 296,224, and females 215,792. Average density of population, 306 persons per square mile, varying from 240 per square mile in Jhajjar tahsil, to 378 per square mile in Goh\u00e1na. Number of villages per square mile, 27; persons per town or village, 1139; houses per square mile, 65; persons per house, 7\u00b74. Classified according to sex and age, the population comprises\u2014under 15 years, males 107,211, and females 91,944; total children, 199,155, or 35\u00b79 per cent. of the population: 15 years and upwards, males 189,013, and females 165,441; total adults, 354,454, or 64\u00b71 per cent.\n\nReligion.\u2014As regards religious distinctions, Rohtak is essentially a Hindu District, as many as 468,905 persons, or 84\u00b76 per cent., being adherents of the ancestral faith. The Muhammadans here sink to 79,510 persons, or 14\u00b73 per cent. Only 159 Sikhs are recorded, belonging chiefly to the ruling families. Jains number 5000; Christians and others, 35.\n\nAs regards ethnical distinctions, the Br\u00e1hmans number 58,211 persons, most of whom are engaged in agriculture, an occupation which they follow with much indolence and thriftlessness. The R\u00e1jputs amount to 7354 Hindus and 22,620 Musalm\u00e1ns. Like their neigh-\nbours, the Bhattis of Hiss\u00e1r and Sirsa, they still retain somewhat of the cattle-lifting reputation which they earned during the long anarchy of the Sikh and Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 struggle. The trading classes are represented by 41,470 Baniy\u00e1s, a large number of whom profess the Jain creed. The majority of the people belong to the inferior castes, amongst which the J\u00e1ts rank by far the first, forming more than one-third of the whole population. They are returned at 180,778 Hindus, and 1998 converted to Isl\u00e1m. The J\u00e1ts keep up their usual reputation for painstaking agriculture; they are divided into two principal clans, which entertain towards one another a singular animosity. There is also a considerable sprinkling of G\u00fajars (3032), Path\u00e1ns (5155), and Bal\u00fach\u00eds (1986).\n\nTown and Rural Population.\u2014The District is noticeable for the very small number of minor villages, and the large proportion of towns with a population exceeding 4000. In 1881 there were 13 so returned\u2014namely, Rohtak, 15,699; Jhajjar, 11,650; Butana, 7656; Gohana, 7444; Kalanaur, 7371; Mahim, 7315; Beri, 6605; Bahadurgarh, 6674; Baroda, 5900; Mandlana, 5469; Kanhaur, 5251; Sanghi, 5194; and Kharkhanda, 4144. These figures show a total of 96,462, or 17.4 per cent. of the District population; but they cannot be considered to represent the real urban population, since many of the above-named places are rather overgrown villages than towns strictly so called. As there were also 169 villages containing a population of more than 1000, out of a total of 486 for the whole District, the tendency for the agricultural body to aggregate in considerable clusters is very marked, and may perhaps be set down to the general insecurity of the country during the century which preceded the British occupation. Only 54 villages contained less than two hundred inhabitants; 134 contained from two to five hundred; and 129 from five hundred to a thousand.\n\nAs regards occupation, the Census Report of 1881 returned the adult male population under the following seven classes:\u2014(1) Professional class, including all Government officials, civil and military, 7827; (2) domestic and menial class, 7803; (3) commercial class, including bankers, merchants, traders, carriers, etc., 5440; (4) agricultural and pastoral class, including gardeners, 100,216; (5) industrial and manufacturing class, including artisans, 48,721; (6) indefinite and non-productive class, including general labourers, 11,481; (7) unspecified, 7525. Urdu and Hind\u00ed are the languages in common use.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Almost all the available land in the District is already under tillage, the returns for 1883\u201384 showing a total of 906,334 acres cultivated, with a narrow margin of 166,790 acres of cultivable waste, the balance consisting of 5198 acres of grazing ground, and 68,671 acres of uncultivable waste. In the central and southern\nparganas, where the peasant is entirely dependent upon the rainfall for his water-supply, barley and gram form the staple spring crops, while jowar, bajra, and cotton are the mainstays of the autumn harvest; but in the canal-irrigated villages to the north and east, wheat is added to the list in spring, and rice or sugar-cane in autumn. The area under the principal crops in 1883\u201384 is returned as follows\u2014jowar, 291,021 acres; bajra, 171,251 acres; gram, 166,701 acres; wheat, 61,311 acres; barley, 30,384 acres; moth, 24,833 acres; rice, 4452 acres; oil-seeds, 2483 acres; cotton, 45,052 acres; sugar-cane, 11,781 acres; and indigo, 4011 acres. Irrigation is chiefly confined to the canal system, the depth of water below the surface, except on the low-lying eastern border, being generally too great to permit the profitable working of wells. The total area irrigated in 1883\u201384 amounted to 119,408 acres, of which 110,991 acres were supplied from Government works and 8417 acres from private sources. The use of manure is on the increase, and the villagers are beginning to appreciate the value of a rotation of crops. Yet the District authorities are of opinion that cultivation has almost reached its highest point, and the land is reported to be in a condition of gradual impoverishment. The growth of cotton and hemp is increasing. The average out-turn per acre in 1883\u201384 was returned as follows:\u2014Wheat, 960 lbs.; rice, 787 lbs.; barley, 522 lbs.; gram, 308 lbs.; indigo, 590 lbs.; oil-seeds, 192 lbs.; and cotton, 236 lbs. per acre. The agricultural stock of the District in 1883 comprised\u2014cows and bullocks, 204,293; horses, 1218; ponies, 1644; donkeys, 10,889; sheep and goats, 59,731; pigs, 10,727; and camels, 2332.\n\nThe mode of tenure known as bhayachura, or brotherhood, is the most common. Throughout the District, the villages are banded together by custom into an organized cluster (or tappa), which formerly owned the supremacy of one chief (or tappadari) village. The tappa includes all the communities immediately surrounding the central and supreme village without distinction of race or caste; and the league is thus in all probability a relic of some defensive arrangement, concerted during the period of Sikh and Bhatti incursions. In many villages, local custom subjects the non-cultivating classes to a tax (called kamini) in favour of the proprietors. By far the greater part of the soil is cultivated by tenants-at-will. Rents rule as follows, according to the nature of the crop which the soil is fitted to produce:\u2014Cotton lands, from 1s. 6d. to \u00a31 per acre; sugar-cane lands, from 2s. to \u00a31, 4s. per acre; wheat lands, irrigated, from 3s. to \u00a31; dry, from 2s. to 9s. per acre; other grains, dry land, from 6d. to 8s. per acre. The Government land revenue assessment in 1883\u201384 amounted to \u00a394,834, or an average of 2s. 0\u00bed. per cultivated acre.\n\nWages have risen of late years, the change being attributed to the\nemigration of labourers (principally Cham\u00e1rs), to find employment on the railway and the Sirhind Canal. Skilled workmen in towns are paid at the rate of from 6d. to 1s. per diem, and unskilled workmen receive from 3d. to 4\u00bdd. Agricultural labourers are generally paid in cash; as much as 4\u00bdd. per diem, with food, is sometimes given at harvest-time. In canal villages, labourers take their wages in kind, receiving one-third of the crop. Prices of food-grains ruled as follows on the 1st January 1884:\u2014Wheat, 19 sers per rupee, or 5s. 1\u00bdd. per cwt.; gram and barley, 26 sers per rupee, or 4s. 4d. per cwt.; jo\u00e1r, 24 sers per rupee, or 4s. 8d. per cwt.; b\u00e1jra, 20 sers per rupee, or 5s. 7d. per cwt.; and rice, 8 sers per rupee, or 14s. per cwt.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014Rohtak, like its neighbour Hiss\u00e1r, suffers greatly from drought. Nine-tenths of its area is entirely dependent on the rainfall, and scarcity from this cause pressed upon the District in 1824, 1830, 1832, and 1837. The severe famine of 1860\u201361 taxed the people to their utmost endurance; and the season of 1868\u201369 was a most disastrous one. Two successive crops, both of grain and fodder, had failed in the dry southern plain, and distress began to show itself early in 1868. Relief measures were at once adopted, and the total number of persons who received gratuitous assistance during the month of January 1869 amounted to 150,102. Famine works were also undertaken, and continued until August. Fears were at one time entertained for the succeeding autumn and spring harvests, but rain happily fell in time to save the District from such an aggravation of its misfortunes. The loss of cattle added to the misfortunes of the cultivating classes. Out of 350,100 head in the District, as many as 88,300, or more than 25 per cent., perished from starvation or disease.\n\nPerhaps, however, the last famine in 1877\u201378, also caused by drought, was as disastrous, and certainly as ruinous as regards the loss of cattle. There was but little rain in June 1877, none in July or August, and only two inches in September, when it was too late to sow anything. Grass withered away from the face of the soil, the cattle began to die in large numbers in the autumn, and famine prices were soon reached. Highway robberies grew common, grain carts were plundered, and finally the b\u00e1z\u00e1r at Badli was attacked and plundered by the J\u00e1ts of the place. The winter rains again failed, and the mortality among cattle became terrible; but no actual relief measures were set on foot. Fortunately, good rain fell at last in July and August 1878, and though the later rains were scanty, an abundant crop of fodder was obtained and a fair crop of grain. During the cold weather of 1877\u201378, the aspect of the country was desolate beyond description. There was literally no crop in the rain-land villages; in a ride of 20 miles not even two or three plots were to be seen. The grass had wholly disappeared, and nothing but thorns and weeds met the eye\nin the fields. The loss of cattle of agriculturists amounted to 176,000 in one way or another\u2014by sale, deaths, or transfers; and it will take the District many years to recover from this. Ultimately, \u00a38000 of the collections due in the spring of 1879 was suspended, which perhaps gave a little relief. Of this drought the people quote the following lines:\u2014\u2018An ox sold for a piece of bread, and a camel for a farthing; the year has destroyed the stock (root) of oxen and buffaloes. The year has killed thirty-four tribes (out of thirty-six); two only, the trader and butcher, have survived, the one by use of his scales and the other by use of his knife.\u2019\n\nThe people declare that the loss of cattle from famines is now much greater than it used to be; and, in so far as there are now no large grazing grounds in the District and the number of cattle has greatly increased, this is true. But fodder is perhaps more carefully preserved than in former days, and famines from actual scarcity of food causing general starvation cannot occur. But again the traders, though they keep by them larger stores of grain than formerly, speculate more freely, and export largely, where they had in old days to confine themselves to the local markets; their relations also with the people are more strained than they used to be. The recurrence of famines is the most important historical feature in the revenue administration of the District, of whose area only 13 per cent. is artificially protected against drought; and it affects the agriculturists to some degree in their social relations. The people of rain-land villages strive to get a few acres of canal land to cultivate in years of drought; and so great is the burden of this to the dwellers in canal estates, that they will not marry their daughters into rain-land villages, if they can help it.\n\nCommerce and Trade, etc.\u2014Rohtak is a purely agricultural District, whose produce hardly more than suffices for its home consumption. A small surplus of grain, cotton, and other raw materials is exported to Delhi, Meerut, and Saharanpur; while piece-goods, spices, iron, sugar, salt, and timber are imported in exchange. Trade is carried on both at permanent markets and religious fairs. There are no manufactures of more than local importance, with the exception of ornamental turbans at Rohtak and saddlery at Kalanaur. Pretty pottery is made at Jhajjar, and cotton cloth for home use is woven in large quantities. A branch of the new Firozpur-Rewari Railway passes through Rohtak District for a distance of 12 miles. The District had 66 miles of metalled and 493 miles of unmetalled road in 1884; the Western Jumna Canal is not navigable in this part of its course.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The imperial revenue of Rohtak District amounted in 1872\u201373 to \u00a393,310, of which \u00a389,184, or 95 per cent., was derived from the land-tax. There was also a local revenue of \u00a37438, besides certain provincial dues which are not collected by separate Districts.\nBy 1883-84, the total revenue had fallen to \u00a378,346, and the land-tax to \u00a365,440. The administrative staff consists of a Deputy Commissioner, 2 extra-Assistant Commissioners, 4 tahsildars, and their subordinates. There were 9 civil and revenue and 23 criminal courts in Rohtak in 1883. The imperial and municipal police numbered 455 men of all ranks. The special village watch is supplemented in this District by a local custom, in accordance with which all able-bodied men of each community take their turn by lot as watchmen. The total number of persons brought to trial upon all charges in 1883 amounted to 1116. There is only one jail in the District, the average daily number of prisoners in which amounted to 236 in 1883.\n\nEducation is slowly progressing in Rohtak. In 1872-73 there were 2852 children receiving instruction. In 1883-84, there were in all (exclusive of indigenous village schools) 49 Government and aided schools under inspection by the Education Department, attended by 2914 pupils. The Census Report of 1881 returned 2864 boys and 33 girls as under instruction; and 13,814 males and 70 females as able to read and write, but not under instruction.\n\nThere are 6 municipalities, namely, Rohtak, Beri, Jhajjar, Khar-khanda, Bahadurgarh, and Gohana. The aggregate revenue of these towns amounted in 1883 to \u00a33018, being at the rate of 1s. 1\u00bdd. per head of their population.\n\nSanitary Aspects.\u2014The climate of Rohtak is considered healthy, except in the northern portions, where percolation from the canal produces malaria, and generates the same fevers and spleen complaints that are so common under similar circumstances in the adjoining District of Karnal. Small-pox also exists in an endemic form. The total number of deaths from all causes reported in 1883 was 14,171, or 25 per thousand of the population; but these figures are probably considerably below the truth. Four charitable dispensaries afforded medical relief to 812 in-door and 19,115 out-door patients in 1883. The average annual rainfall at Rohtak town for seventeen years ending 1882-83 was 18\u00b78 inches. In 1883-84, only 14\u00b74 inches were measured. No thermometrical returns are available.

Situated in lat. 28\u00b0 54' N., and long. 76\u00b0 38' E., 42 miles north-west of Delhi, on the Hiss\u00e1r road. Rohtak town dates from a remote antiquity, though little can now be recovered of its early history. The ancient site, known as Khokra-kot, lies a small distance north of the modern town. Rebuilt, according to one tradition, in the time of Prithwi R\u00e1j (1160 A.D.); according to another, as early as the middle of the 4th century. During the stormy period which succeeded the decay of the Mughal Empire, Rohtak fell into the hands of one chieftain after another. It became in 1824 the head-quarters of a British District, a position which it has since retained. Population (1881) 15,699, namely, males 8155, and females 7544. Hindus number 8180; Muhammadans, 6928; Jains, 501; Sikhs, 62; and Christians, 28. Number of houses, 2622. Municipal income (1883-84), \u00a3756, or 1s. per head. The town is the centre of a local grain trade, but is of small commercial importance outside its own neighbourhood. Manufacture of cotton turbans. Court-house, police station, tahsil\u00ed, church, d\u00e1k bungalow, post-office, school-house, dispensary, public garden. An annual horse show is held at Rohtak in October, which, though only recently established, promises to become very popular.\n\nRohtang.\u2014Pass in K\u00e1ngra District, Punjab, over the Him\u00e1layan ranges. Lat. 32\u00b0 22' 20\" N., long. 77\u00b0 17' 20\" E. The pass lies between Koks\u00e1r in L\u00e1hul and Palch\u00e1n in K\u00falu. A made road runs over it, practicable for laden mules and ponies. The crest has an elevation\nof only 13,000 feet above the sea\u2014very much lower than that of most neighbouring passes. The range on either side rises to a height of 16,000 feet, while several peaks within 12 miles exceed 20,000 feet. The main road from Sult\u00e1npur and K\u00e1ngra to Leh and Y\u00e1rkand crosses this pass, and then proceeds by the valleys of the Chandra and Bh\u00e1ga to the B\u00e1ra L\u00e1cha, whence it descends into Lad\u00e1kh. The Rohtang pass is generally open fairly well until the end of December. The Beas (Bi\u00e1s) takes its rise at the summit of the pass from a spring called Bi\u00e1skund, which is regarded with a certain amount of veneration by Hindus.\n\nRoht\u00e1s.\u2014See post, Rotas.\n\nRoht\u00e1sgarh.\u2014Hill fort in Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Bengal, about 30 miles south of Sasseram town, overlooking the junction of the Koel with the Son (Soane) river. Lat. 24\u00b0 37' 30\" N., long. 83\u00b0 55' 50\" E. The principal place of interest in the District from an antiquarian point of view. It derives its name from Rohit\u00e1swa, son of Harischandra, a Hindu king of the Solar dynasty, whose image was worshipped on this spot till destroyed by Aurangzeb. Little is known concerning the persons who held the fort from Harischandra's time until 1539, the year of its capture by Sher Sh\u00e1h, who immediately began to strengthen the works, but soon after selected a more favourable site at Shergarh. M\u00e1n Singh, Akbar's Viceroy of Bengal, at the end of the 16th century, chose Roht\u00e1s as his stronghold; and two inscriptions in Sanskrit and Persian attribute to him all the buildings now existing. The remains of the fortress occupy a part of the table-land of Roht\u00e1sgarh, about 4 miles from east to west and 5 miles from north to south, with a circumference of nearly 28 miles. In 1848, Dr. Hooker ascertained its precise elevation to be 1490 feet. Much of the area is bare rock, but there is also a large quantity of red soil. The hill is accessible by 83 paths, of which four are called the great gh\u00e1ts, and the rest gh\u00e1dtis. The principal antiquities of Roht\u00e1sgarh are\u2014two temples, said to have been built by M\u00e1n Singh, one of which is covered by a dome surpassing in lightness all the Hindu works that Dr. Buchanan-Hamilton had ever seen; a small mosque, ascribed to Aurangzeb; the palace or mah\u00e1l sar\u00e1i, with the building known as the bar\u00e1 dw\u00e1ri or twelve gates, where business was transacted. All these edifices are fully described in the Statistical Account of Bengal, vol. xii. pp. 209\u2013212. (There is another famous Roht\u00e1s fort on the skirts of the Salt Range, in the Punjab. See under Rotas, the spelling fixed by the Punjab Government.)\n\nRojhan.\u2014Town in R\u00e1janpur tahsil, Dera Gh\u00e1z\u00ed Kh\u00e1n District, Punjab; situated in lat. 28\u00b0 17' N., long. 68\u00b0 19' E., on the west bank of the Indus, below Dera Gh\u00e1z\u00ed Kh\u00e1n town.

It is completely excavated, and has apertures at the top, where Bhim used to place his cooking utensils. The temple is small, and stands by the water's edge. Elevation above sea-level, 2200 feet.\n\n**Rudrapur (Rudarpur).**\u2014Town in Gorakhpur District, North-Western Provinces. Situated in lat. $26^\\circ 26' 40''$ N., and long. $83^\\circ 39' 35''$ E.; on the Bathu\u00e1 n\u00e1la, upon the Gorakhpur and Barhaj road, 23 miles south-east of Gorakhpur town. Population (1881) 9843, namely, Hindus 8840, and Muhammadans 1003. The gola or grain market, in the business part of the town, is the entrep\u00f4t whence the grain and g\u00far (syrup) of the neighbourhood are exported by river. Except by river, the trade is purely local; and it is prevented from developing by a cordon of quagmires created by the rains, which for several months of the year prevents any wheeled communication with the rest of the District. A small house-tax is levied for police and conservancy purposes. Within the limits of the town are the remains of an enormous fort, said to have been erected by the early R\u00e1jput settlers when threatened by the aboriginal Bhars, before the recovery of the country by the latter. (See Gorakhpur District.) Fair in February attracts about 1500 persons.\n\n**Rudrapur.**\u2014Small village in the Tar\u00e1i District, North-Western Provinces.

Total population (1881) 154,303, namely, males 88,046, and females 66,257. Average density, 557 persons per square mile. Classified according to religion, the population consists of\u2014Hindus, 85,439; Muhammadans, 49,276; Sikhs, 19,341; Jains, 127; and Christians, 120. Of the 361 towns and villages, 271 contain less than five hundred inhabitants; 65 from five hundred to a thousand; and 24 from one to two thousand inhabitants. The only place with a population exceeding two thousand inhabitants is R\u00fapar Town (10,326).

The town is of considerable antiquity, formerly known as R\u00fapnagar. It was occupied about 1763 by Hari Singh, a Sikh chieftain, who seized upon a wide tract south of the Sutlej, stretching along the foot of the Him\u00e1layas. In 1792 he divided his estates\nbetween his two sons, Charrat Singh and Dewa Singh, the former of whom obtained R\u00fapar. The estates were confiscated in 1846, in consequence of the part taken by the family during the Sikh war of the preceding year. R\u00fapar is important as being the site of the head-works of the Sirhind Canal, and till recently the residence of a numerous staff of European officers, superintending the construction of the works. Population (1881) 10,326, namely, males 6171, and females 4155. Muhammadans number 5110; Hindus, 4708; Sikhs, 388; Jains, 109; and Christians, 11. Number of houses, 1673. Municipal income (1883\u201384), \u00a3665, or an average of 1s. 3\u00bdd. per head. Two important religious fairs\u2014one Muhammadan, at the tomb of Sh\u00e1h Khalid, in the month of Jaishtha, attracting 50,000 persons; the other, a Hindu bathing festival on the banks of the Sutlej, in April, attended by an equal number of persons. R\u00fapar is an important mart of exchange between the hills and plains, and carries on a considerable trade in grain, sugar, and indigo. Imports of salt from the Salt Range, re-exported to the hills in return for iron, ginger, potatoes, turmeric, opium, and hemp. Manufacture of cotton cloth, iron hooks, and other hardware. Assistant Commissioner's court, tahs\u00edl, police office, staging bungalow.\n\nR\u00fapb\u00e1s.\u2014Town in Bhartpur State, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. The town was founded by R\u00fap Singh, a descendant of the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Chittorgarh, who became a Muhammadan, and was a constant attendant at the court of the Emperor Akbar. He built a palace in the Mughal style of architecture, with a large tank attached, both of which are still in existence. There are in the vicinity three colossal images of Baldeoji, his wife, and Yudhisthira; two enormous monolith columns or obelisks, the inscriptions on which are illegible; and another colossal image, supposed to represent a Buddhist or Jain divinity. Dispensary and post-office.\n\nR\u00fapgarh.\u2014Fort in the Songarh Sub-division of Nosari (Navasari) Division, Baroda State, Bombay Presidency. Situated about 15 miles south of the town of Songarh, and about 35 miles east of Nosari station on the Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway, in a salient angle of the Baroda frontier. At one time the fort was useful for keeping the Bhils in check. A tank in the fort is supplied by a perennial spring; Lieutenant J. E. Gibbs, R.E., who visited it in 1875, attributes the presence of the constant supply of cold water with no motion or overflow to the condensation of the vapour of the daily sea-breezes, as in the case of ponds on the South Downs of England.\n\nR\u00fapnagar.\u2014Town in Udaipur State, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. Situated on the summit of the Aravall\u00eds, between the Desuri and Someshwar passes. Steep and precipitous hill-sides render the village unapproachable from the north and east. Defended by outworks overlooking the plains and\nthe Desuri pass on the west and south. Founded about 1772, when the Solanki Rajputs of Desuri were finally driven out of that place by Marwar troops. The site seems to have been chosen solely for defence; there is no cultivation belonging to the town, nor is any revenue derived from it.\n\nRupnagarh.\u2014Town in Kishangarh State, Rajputana. Population (1881) 5665, namely, Hindus, 4053; Muhammadans, 857; and 'others,' 755.\n\nRupnarayan.\u2014River of Bengal. The name given to the Dhal-kisor after the confluence of the Silai, which flows into it from Midnapur District. The course of the Rupnarayan, from where it first touches upon Hugli District to where it falls into the Hugli river opposite Hugli Point, in lat. 22\u00b0 12' 30\" N., long. 88\u00b0 3' E., is generally south-easterly. Two miles south of Kaila gh\u00e1t, its principal ferry, the Rupnarayan is crossed by the Midnapur High-Level Canal from Ulubaria. It is tidal throughout its entire course; and a heavy bore ascends as high as the mouth of the Bakshshi kh\u00e1l, the chief tributary of the Rupnarayan within Hugli District. The river is protected on its right bank, within Midnapur District, by a continuous embankment 29 miles 2373 feet in length; and it is also embanked all along its left bank, within Hugli District, from its junction with the Bakshshi kh\u00e1l to its union with the Hugli river. The bordering lands are more or less inundated by the spring tides in April and May, which leave behind destructive impregnations of salt, rendering them unfit for cultivation unless small defensive works are thrown up round the fields every year to keep the water out. Grass and h\u00f3gl\u00e1 reeds are the ordinary produce, except in years when the rains set in and close early, when a late rice crop can be planted in September. The Rupnarayan is navigable throughout the year by native boats of 4 tons burden as far as Gh\u00e1t\u00e1l village, in Midnapur District. The river is not fordable at any season of the year within the limits of Hugli District.\n\nRupnarayan and Rasulpur Canal.\u2014Tidal canal in Midnapur, Bengal, extending from the Rupnarayan to the Rasulpur river, in the Hijili portion of the District; divided into two reaches. The first reach is called the Bank\u00e1 Canal, and runs from near the mouth of the Rupnarayan river to the Haldi river, a distance of 8 miles: top width, 72 feet; bottom width, 62 feet; depth, 8 feet. The second section is called the Tiropki\u00e1 Canal, and runs from the Haldi to the Rasulpur river, a length of 18 miles: top width, 92 feet; bottom width, 64 feet; depth, 8 feet. These canals were completed and opened throughout on the 1st September 1873. They are intended for navigation only; and the tolls taken during the year 1873-74 amounted to \u00a32797, 16s., while the miscellaneous revenue was \u00a363, 18s. The deficiency for\nthe year, exclusive of interest, was estimated at \u00a3999, 6s. In 1881-82 the tolls amounted to \u00a34653, and the miscellaneous revenue to \u00a3120.\n\n**R\u00fapn\u00e1th.**\u2014Village in the *pargan\u00e1* of Amw\u00ed, in the Jaintia Hills, Assam, with a Hindu temple greatly frequented by pilgrims from the plains of Sylhet. In the neighbourhood are several caverns in the limestone formation, extending for a great distance beneath the earth. Out of one of these a Chinese army is fabled to have marched to the invasion of India. In another, the hanging stalactites have been carved to represent the gods of the Hindu pantheon.\n\n**R\u00farkha Kal\u00e1n.**\u2014Town in Phillaur *tahsil*, Jalandhar (Jullundur) District, Punjab. Lat. 31\u00b0 7' 12\" N., long. 76\u00b0 45' 30\" E. Population (1881) 5492; consisting of Hindus, 3362; Muhammadans, 1189; and Sikhs 941. Number of houses, 950. R\u00farkha Kal\u00e1n is a mere agricultural village, or collection of hamlets, with an insignificant trade in sugar, but otherwise unimportant. Primary school.\n\n**R\u00farki.**\u2014Eastern *tahsil* of Sah\u00e1ranpur District, North-Western Provinces; lying at the foot of the Siw\u00e1lik Hills, along the western bank of the Ganges, and watered by the Ganges Canal, comprising the *parganas* of R\u00farki, Jaw\u00e1l\u00e1pur, Manglaur, and Bhagw\u00e1npur. Area, 789 square miles, of which 356 square miles are cultivated. Population (1872) 242,696; (1881) 274,571, namely, males 151,524, and females 123,047. Increase of population since 1872, 31,875, or 13\u00b71 per cent. in nine years. Classified according to religion, the population consists of\u2014Hindus, 189,734; Muhammadans, 82,989; Jains, 480; and \u2018others,\u2019 1368. Of 433 villages, 271 contain a population of less than five hundred inhabitants; 99 between five hundred and a thousand; 58 between one and five thousand; and 5 upwards of five thousand. Total Government land revenue, \u00a327,987, or including local rates and cesses levied on land, \u00a331,362. Total rental paid by cultivators, including cesses, \u00a357,921. In 1884 the *tahsil* contained 1 civil and 5 criminal courts; number of police circles (*th\u00e1n\u00e1s*), 7; strength of regular police, 104 men; village watch or rural police (*chaukid\u00e1rs*), 491.\n\n**R\u00farki.**\u2014Modern manufacturing town, municipality, and cantonment in Sah\u00e1ranpur District, North-Western Provinces, and headquarters of R\u00farki *tahsil*; situated in lat. 29\u00b0 52' 25\" N., long. 77\u00b0 55' 40\" E.; on an elevated ridge overlooking the bed of the Sol\u00e1ni river, 22 miles east of Sah\u00e1ranpur city. Population (1872) 10,778; (1881) 15,953, namely, males 9829, and females 6124. Classified according to religion, the population consists of\u2014Hindus, 9574; Muhammadans, 4963; Jains, 121; Christians, 1159; and \u2018others,\u2019 136. Municipal income (1883-84), \u00a31462, of which \u00a3787 was derived from taxation; average incidence of taxation, rs. 2\u00bdd. per head of the population (12,818) within municipal limits.\nBefore the commencement of the Ganges Canal works, R\u00farki was a mere mud-built village on the banks of the Sol\u00e1ni; it is now a flourishing town with broad metalled roadways, meeting at right angles, and lined with excellent shops. In the centre of the town is a large open chawk or market-place. The Ganges Canal passes close to R\u00farki, between high embankments. At a short distance above the town, it is carried over a lofty viaduct. R\u00farki owes its chief importance to being the head-quarters of the Ganges Canal workshops and iron foundry, established in 1845-46, much extended and improved in 1852, and employing 850 hands in 1882. The Thomason Civil Engineering College, founded in 1847, for instructing natives and others in practical engineering, with a view to employment upon public works, had a total of 99 regular students in 1882. This institution is the largest and most important engineering college in India; and during its forty years of teaching may be said to have created an indigenous engineering profession. The men trained by its professors have supplied the working staff by which most of the great public works of British India have been executed. The building is spacious and handsome; and its staff is maintained at the highest point of efficiency. The students are partly English youths born in the country, partly Eurasians and natives; with special classes for soldiers, picked for their ability from the British regiments in India. The sappers and miners of the native army have been cantoned at R\u00farki since 1853, and it has formed a station for British troops since 1860. The garrison numbers about 1000 men of all ranks. Church, dispensary, police station, post-office, tahsili, mission school of Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. The low ground surrounding the town, together with the percolation from the canal, gives rise to fever and other malarious diseases; much, however, has been done to remedy this evil. Excellent meteorological observatory.\n\nRusera (Roshra).\u2014Town and municipality in Darbhangah District, Bengal; situated on the east bank of the Little Gandak, just below the confluence of that river with the B\u00e1ghmat\u00ed, in lat. 25\u00b0 45' 8\" N., and long. 86\u00b0 4' 8\" E. Population (1881) 11,578, namely, males 5534, and females 6044. Hindus number 11,196, and Muhammadans 382. Municipal income (1883-84), \u00a3519, of which \u00a3456 was derived from taxation; average incidence of taxation, 9\u00bdd. per head. Rusera town contains a police station, distillery, and perhaps the largest b\u00e1z\u00e1r in the District; seat of a large trade in grain, oil-seeds, saltpetre, gh\u00ed, cloth, and other articles. An aided English school was established here in 1870. Roads run from Rusera to Dalsinhsar\u00e1i, N\u00e1garbasti, T\u00e1jpur, Baher\u00e1 via H\u00e1ti, and to Darbhangah via Hathauri, and to R\u00e1jgh\u00e1t on the Tilj\u00faga. Before the change in the course of the B\u00e1ghmat\u00ed, direct water communication was open to Darbhangah all the year round. In\n1876\u201377, the total registered traffic of Rusera was valued at \u00a3197,000. The principal exports were\u2014oil-seeds, \u00a3100,000; tobacco, \u00a315,000; and ghi, \u00a312,000: the imports comprised food-grain, \u00a39000; salt, \u00a349,000. Owing to an alteration in the system of registration, no later statistics of trade are available.\n\n**Rushikulya.**\u2014River in Ganj\u00e1m District, Madras Presidency. Rises in the Chinna Kimidi M\u00e1liyas, in lat. 19\u00b0 55' 20\" N., and long. 84\u00b0 20' E., and runs south-east to Aska, where it is joined by the Mah\u00e1nadi; thence south-east and east till it enters the sea at Ganj\u00e1m town, in lat. 19\u00b0 22' N., and long. 85\u00b0 7' E. Its length is about 115 miles, the principal towns on its banks being Surad\u00e1, Aska, Purushottapur, and Ganj\u00e1m. It is spanned at Aska by a fine masonry bridge of 19 arches.\n\n**Russellkonda** (called after Mr. Russell, who was Commissioner here in 1835).\u2014Town in Gumsar taluk, Ganj\u00e1m District, Madras Presidency.

Bi-weekly markets on Tuesdays and Saturdays.\n\n**Sabari** (*Seberi*, *Severi*, *Savari*).\u2014River, rising in the Eastern Gh\u00e1ts, in the Native State of Jaipur (Jeypore), Madras; rushes through a rocky channel in a succession of rapids till it enters the Upper God\u00e1vari District, Central Provinces, within which its course for 25 miles is free from obstructions. It falls into the God\u00e1vari in lat. $17^\\circ 35'$ N., and long. $81^\\circ 18'$ E.\n\n**Sab\u00e1thu**.\u2014Cantonment in Simla District, Punjab.\u2014See **Sub\u00e1thu**.\n\n**Sabay-yon** (*Tsam-bay-run* or *Tsa bay-yun*).\u2014Township in Bassein District, Irawadi Division, Lower Burma. Area, 661 square miles. Population (1881) 60,508. Gross revenue, \u00a323,330. In the southwest the country is undulating. In the north and east the land is in places swampy, and rice cultivation is carried on; in other places it is covered with tree and grass jungle, passing, near the junction of the Dag\u00e1 and Shwe-nyaung rivers, into good rice land again. In the northeast corner of the township, a large area has been rendered available for rice by an embankment. This township comprises 7 revenue circles. Head-quarters at Ky\u00fan-pyaw town.\n\n**S\u00e1bh\u00e1r**.\u2014Village and ruins in Dacca District, Bengal; situated on the north bank of the Bur\u00edgang\u00e1, a tributary of the Dhaleswar\u00ed, in lat. $23^\\circ 50' 55''$ N., and long. $90^\\circ 17' 10''$ E. Formerly the capital of the Bhuiy\u00e1 R\u00e1j\u00e1 Harischandra. In 1839, the only trace that remained of his residence was a heap of bricks and earth overgrown with jungle. Small trade in cloth and ironware.\n\n**Sabi**.\u2014River in Gurg\u00e1on District, Punjab.\u2014See **Sahibi**.\n\n**Sach\u00edn**.\u2014Native State within the British Political Agency of Surat, in Gujar\u00e1t, Bombay Presidency. The villages constituting the State are much separated, some of them being surrounded by British territory, and others by portions of Baroda State. Sach\u00edn may, however, roughly speaking, be said to lie within the limits of the British District of Surat. It occupies an area of about 42 square miles, with a population (1881) of 15,721, namely, males 7371, and females 8350. Hindus number 13,214; Muhammadans, 2307; and Christians, 200. Number of houses, 3729; villages, 19. Irrigation is carried on from tanks and wells. The climate is healthy, and the usual cereals are cultivated, as well as cotton and sugar-cane. Yarn and coarse cloth are manufactured. A recently built breakwater at Dumas, and a causeway at Bh\u00edmpur, by keeping back sea-water, have contributed towards the reclamation of a considerable area of hitherto uncultivable salt land.\n\nThe Naw\u00e1b of Sach\u00edn is by descent a Habshi or Abyssinian. When his ancestors first came to India is doubtful; but they were long known on the western coast as the Sid\u00eds of Danda-R\u00e1j\u00e1pur and Janjir\u00e1. They\nwere also the admirals of the fleets of the kings of Ahmadnagar and Bij\u00e1pur, in the Deccan, whilst those dynasties lasted, and subsequently of the Mughal Emperors, being appointed to that office by Aurangzeb about 1660, with an annual assignment of \u00a330,000 on the Surat revenues for their maintenance. On the decline of the Mughal Empire the Sidis became notorious pirates, plundering the ships of all nations, except the English, whose friendship they appear to have early cultivated. The branch of the family who had their head-quarters at the island of Janjir\u00e1 remained chiefs of that place during the wars between Sivaji and the Mughals, also during the war between the Peshw\u00e1 and the British Government.\n\nDuring these wars different members of the family were alternately supported by either party as best suited its own interests. Towards the end of the last century, B\u00e1lu Mi\u00e1 Sidi, the heir to the throne of Janjir\u00e1 and to the other possessions of the Sid\u00eds, was expelled from his dominions by a younger branch of the family (1784-91). He appealed for aid to the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s and the British. The Peshw\u00e1 being desirous of obtaining Janjir\u00e1, an arrangement was come to in 1791, by which B\u00e1lu Mi\u00e1 ceded to the Peshw\u00e1 Janjir\u00e1 in return for Sach\u00edn. B\u00e1lu Mi\u00e1 duly got possession of his new State of Sach\u00edn; but when the Peshw\u00e1 claimed Janjir\u00e1 the Sid\u00eds who held it refused to give it up, and succeeded in maintaining their independence. Sach\u00edn remained in the hands of B\u00e1lu Mi\u00e1 and his descendants; while Janjir\u00e1 is still held by the younger branch of the family who had ousted B\u00e1lu Mi\u00e1, the Peshw\u00e1 never having been able to establish his influence. Janjir\u00e1 is reckoned a maiden fortress to this day. A full account of the transactions between the British, the Peshw\u00e1, and the rival sides of Janjir\u00e1 and Sach\u00edn, will be found in Aitchison's Treaties, vol. iv. pp. 324 et seq., ed. 1876.\n\nThe present (1883-84) chief of Sach\u00edn is Naw\u00e1b Sidi Abdul\u00b7K\u00e1dar Muhammad Y\u00e1kut Kh\u00e1n, a Sunn\u00ed Musalm\u00e1n, who is now a student at the R\u00e1jkum\u00e1r College. During his minority the affairs of the State are administered by a British officer. The chief is entitled to a salute of 9 guns, and has power to try for capital offences, without the express permission of the Political Agent, his own subjects only. The family hold a title authorizing adoption, and succession follows the rule of primogeniture.\n\nThe survey and land settlement of the State were completed in 1882-83. On the whole, the rates are higher than in neighbouring British villages, but much lower than the r\u00e1yats had hitherto paid. The gross revenue in 1883-84 amounted to \u00a317,986, of which \u00a312,051 was derived from the land-tax. The usual village establishments of p\u00e1tels, havild\u00e1rs, vettias are kept up, with a faujd\u00e1r to inquire into offences. In 1883-84 the State contained 15 schools\nwith 944 pupils; only five villages were without schools. The average annual rainfall of the five years ending 1882\u201383 was 47.2 inches. The rainfall of 1883\u201384 was 35.7 inches.\n\n**Sach\u00edn.**\u2014Capital of Sachin State, Bombay Presidency; situated in lat. 21\u00b0 3' 40\" N., and long. 72\u00b0 59' E., 9 miles south of Surat city. Population (1872) 722; not returned separately in the Census of 1881. Good roads connect it with Surat, with Lachpur, on the Mindhola, the former residence of the Naw\u00e1bs, and with Sach\u00edn station on the Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway. The town contains the palace of the Naw\u00e1b, a small fort, court-house, jail, post-office, dispensary, dharm\u00e1s\u00e1la, etc. The roads are lighted and watered.\n\n**S\u00e1d\u00e1b\u00e1d.**\u2014Easternmost tahsil of Muttra (Mathur\u00e1) District, North-Western Provinces; conterminous with S\u00e1d\u00e1b\u00e1d pargan\u00e1. The tahsil just touches on the Jumna in its south-western corner, but is intersected through its centre by the Jhirna or Kharon river, an important stream in the rains, but dry or almost so at other seasons. It drains a valley about two or three miles wide on each side, the boundary line of which is marked by denuded sandy slopes. Excepting the Jhirna valley, and the small area of Jumna ravines and khadar land, the tahsil is extremely level and uniform. There are no other streams of any size, and jhils and marshes are few. The prevailing soil is piliya, interspersed with tracts of bh\u00edr or sand, but the total area of the latter is insignificant. There is a little \u00fasar in the west of the tahsil, and the patches of waste that still remain are often covered with scrub jungle, and sometimes with dh\u00e1k trees. There is no canal irrigation, and the area irrigated from jhils and ponds is insignificant, but that commanded by wells is exceptionally large. Cotton, owing to the suitability of the piliya soil for its growth, and the vicinity of Hathr\u00e1s, the largest cotton mart in Northern India, is the crop most extensively grown. Barley, jo\u00e1r, and arhar are the other principal crops, and a considerable amount of hemp and indigo are also raised.\n\nThe total area of S\u00e1d\u00e1b\u00e1d tahsil in 1881\u201382 was 180 square miles, of which 148 square miles were under cultivation, 19 square miles cultivable, and only 13 square miles uncultivable waste. Population (1881) 89,217, namely, males 49,110, and females 40,107; average density of population, 495 persons per square mile. Classified according to religion, there were in 1881\u2014Hindus, 82,289; Muhammadans, 6598; and Jains, 330. Of the 127 towns and villages comprising the tahsil, 70 contained less than five hundred inhabitants; 37 between five hundred and a thousand; and 19 between one and five thousand. The only place with upwards of five thousand inhabitants was Kursanda (6018). Of the total cultivated area at the time of the recent land settlement, 25,679 acres were cultivated by proprietors themselves as sir or homestead lands, 27,544 acres by\ntenants with occupancy rights, 45,173 acres by tenants-at-will, while 749 acres were rent-free land granted by z\u0101m\u012bnd\u0101rs, and 898 acres were cultivated gardens. J\u00e1ts, Br\u00e1hmans, R\u00e1jputs, and Ah\u00edrs cultivate nearly the whole of the s\u012br area; and from the same castes, with the addition of Cham\u00e1rs and Gadari\u00e1s, the tenantry is almost entirely recruited. Total Government land revenue (1881-82), \u00a331,596, or, including local rates and cesses levied on land, \u00a335,391. Total rental, including local rates and cesses, paid by cultivators, \u00a346,173. The rates of rent paid by tenants-at-will are considerably higher than those paid by occupancy tenants, although the latter generally cultivate lands of a better quality; the difference in the rates being 11 per cent. in the west of the tahsil, and as much as 15 per cent. in the east. S\u00e1d\u00e1b\u00e1d tahsil contained in 1883, 1 criminal court, 2 police stations (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), a regular police force of 40 men, and a village watch or rural police of 236 chaukid\u00e1rs.\n\nS\u00e1d\u00e1b\u00e1d.\u2014Town in Muttra (Mathur\u00e1) District, North-Western Provinces, and head-quarters of S\u00e1d\u00e1b\u00e1d tahsil; situated in lat. 27\u00b0 26' 13\" N., and long. 73\u00b0 4' 42\" E., on the Jhirna stream, at the junction of four important metalled roads connecting with it Muttra town, with Jalesar road station on the East Indian Railway, and with Agra and Al\u00edgarh towns. Population (1881) 3295. S\u00e1d\u00e1b\u00e1d was founded by W\u00e1z\u00edr S\u00e1dull\u00e1 Kh\u00e1n, the minister of the Emperor Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n, in the first half of the 17th century. On the British annexation in 1803, the town became the capital of a District, and continued so till the formation of the present District of Muttra in 1832. The tahsil building, which occupies the site of a fort of Himmat Bah\u00e1dur, is a small but substantial building, with a deep fosse, and pierced and battlemented walls. It occupies a commanding position; and, as it is supplied with a good masonry well in the courtyard, it is probably capable of standing a siege in an emergency. S\u00e1d\u00e1b\u00e1d was attacked by the J\u00e1t rebels during the Mutiny, and seven lives were lost in the defence before they were repulsed. The Hindu R\u00e1jput who led the defence was rewarded by a grant of a village in Al\u00edgarh District; and two of the J\u00e1t ringleaders belonging to Kursanda were hanged. The town contains a large Hindu temple with an architectural fa\u00e7ade, and a handsome white mosque recently erected by the leading Muhammadan landholder. A bi-weekly market is held on Tuesdays and Saturdays. Rest-house, police station, post-office, and Anglo-vernacular school. A small house-tax raised for police and conservancy purposes realized \u00a372 in 1881-82.\n\nSadalg\u00ed.\u2014Town in Belg\u00e1um District, Bombay Presidency; situated 51 miles north of Belg\u00e1um town, and 25 south-east of Kolh\u00e1pur, in lat. 16\u00b0 33' N., and long. 74\u00b0 33' E. Population (1881) 7240. Coarse waistcloths, blankets, and women's robes are woven; but the chief\nindustry in the town and neighbourhood is sugar-making. A large area is cultivated with sugar-cane, and a considerable quantity of molasses is prepared here. Weekly market on Tuesdays. Government vernacular school.\n\n**Sad\u00e1shivgarh (Sad\u00e1shivgad).** \u2014 Fort in North K\u00e1nara District, Bombay Presidency; situated in lat. $14^\\circ 50' 25''$ N., and long. $74^\\circ 10' 55''$ E., on the north side of the entrance to the K\u00e1l\u00ed or K\u00e1l\u00e1 river. Sad\u00e1shivgarh fort is built on a flat-topped hill 220 feet high, with a steep and inaccessible face on the river side. The fortifications consist of a granite and mortar wall 20 feet high and 6 feet thick, enclosing a space of 10 acres. The wall has towers and openings for guns, and is surrounded by a moat. Except the battlements and part of the wall on the south, the whole is in fair repair. The fort has three outworks. One at the base of the south face, with its foundations under water; the second parallel to the verge of the east slope; and the third opposite the main fort, with a moat and battlements. At the southern corner of the hill are two Government bungalows.\n\nSad\u00e1shivgarh fort was built by a Sonda chief between 1674 and 1715. In 1752 the Portuguese declared war against the Sonda chief, and after a slight conflict carried the fort, which they greatly strengthened. In 1754 the Portuguese restored the fort to the Sonda chief. In 1763, Sad\u00e1shivgarh was taken by Haidar \u00c1lf's general, Fazl Ull\u00e1 Kh\u00e1n. In 1783 a detachment of General Mathew's force was sent to occupy Sad\u00e1shivgarh. In 1799 it was garrisoned by Tip\u00fa's troops.\n\nThe village and port of Chit\u00e1kul are situated at the foot of the hill occupied by Sad\u00e1shivgarh fort. Population (1881) 3939. Though now confined to the village itself, the name Chit\u00e1kul originally included a considerable tract of land. Under the forms Sindabur, Chintabor, Cintabor, Cintapor, Cintacola, Cintacora, Chittakula, and Chitekula, the place appears in the writings of many authors, from the Arab traveller Masudi (about 900 A.D.) to the English geographer Ogilvy (about 1600). Custom-house, market, Roman Catholic church, vernacular school, old military guard-room and hospital, now used as rest-house and police station. Sad\u00e1shivgarh or Chit\u00e1kul is one of the three ports of the K\u00e1rw\u00e1r Customs Division. Average annual value of trade for the five years ending 1881\u201382\u2014imports \u00a31182, exports \u00a38711; total, \u00a39893. Value in 1881\u201382\u2014imports \u00a31585, exports \u00a38772; total, \u00a310,357.\n\n**S\u00e1d\u00e1t Masonda.** \u2014 Village in Jaunpur tahsil, Jaunpur District, 5\u00bd miles north-east of Jaunpur town, with which it is connected by an unmetalled road. Population (1881) 2707, chiefly well-to-do Sayyid Muhammadans. Small b\u00e1z\u00e1r; tri-weekly markets on Sundays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.\n\n**S\u00e1dhaur\u00e1.** \u2014 Town and municipality in N\u00e1r\u00e1ingarh tahsil, Amb\u00e1la\n(Umballa) District, Punjab; situated in lat. $30^\\circ 23'$ N., and long. $77^\\circ 16'$ E., near the hills, 26 miles east of Ambala city. Population (1881) 10,794, namely, males 5,532, and females 5,262. Muhammadans number 5,847; Hindus, 4,415; Sikhs, 408; and Jains, 124. Number of houses, 1,756. Municipal income (1883\u201384), \u00a3560, or an average of 1s. 6\u00bdd. per head. A town of great antiquity, dating back to the time of Mahmud of Ghazni, but now of no political importance. Yearly fair at the shrine of Shah Kumais, a Muhammadan saint, lasting five days, and attended by about 20,000 persons. Manufacture of coarse cloth; local trade in country produce. Middle school.\n\nSadiy\u00e1.\u2014The name formerly given to a tract of country stretching along the north bank of the Brahmaputra, on the extreme north-east frontier of Assam. The present th\u00e1na or police circle of Sadiy\u00e1, forming part of the Sub-division of Dibrugarh, in Lakhimpur District, has an area of 178 square miles. Population (1881) 9,415, dwelling in 74 villages and 1,479 houses.\n\nSadiy\u00e1.\u2014Village in Lakhimpur District, Assam; situated in lat. $27^\\circ 49' 45''$ N., and long. $95^\\circ 41' 35''$ E., on the right or north bank of the main stream of the Brahmaputra, about 70 miles above Dibrugarh. Sadiy\u00e1 is the extreme north-east frontier outpost of British India, and has always possessed much political importance. It is supposed to have been one of the first places occupied by the Ahams, when they invaded Assam from the direction of Burma. In later times, the government of the surrounding country was administered by a viceroy of the Aham kings, with the title of Sadiy\u00e1 Kho\u00e1. When the Burmese occupied Assam, this title was conferred on a chief of the aboriginal tribe of Kh\u00e1mt\u00eds, whose office was confirmed on the annexation of Assam by the British in 1826. The Sadiy\u00e1 Kho\u00e1 furnished a military contingent of 100 men, and supported himself by forced contributions. At the same time a British garrison was stationed at Sadiy\u00e1; and subsequently, in 1835, when the exactions of the Kh\u00e1mt\u00ed chief became intolerable, the civil administration was placed in the hands of the officer commanding the troops. In 1839 the Kh\u00e1mt\u00eds rose in rebellion. They cut off the outpost at Sadiy\u00e1, and killed Major White, the commandant and Political Agent, together with the detachment of Sepoys. At this time, Sadiy\u00e1 was described as an important place, with a population of 4,000 souls. It dwindled gradually into a very insignificant village, but is now becoming again a flourishing seat of trade. The garrison generally consists of 1 European officer and about 150 men of one of the Assam regiments.\n\nIn order to promote friendly relations with the neighbouring hill tribes of Kh\u00e1mt\u00eds, Mishm\u00eds, and Singphos, a fair is held annually at the time of full moon in the end of January or beginning of February.\nThe hillmen bring down caoutchouc, wax, musk, cloth, mats, d\u0101os or hill-knives, and ivory, which they exchange for cotton cloth, salt, metal utensils, silver ear-rings, beads, brass wire, and opium. In 1876, the attendance of hillmen was estimated at 3000; the value of the articles they sold at \u00a34910, and the value of those they bought at \u00a34447. Latterly, the number of visitors to the fair has fallen off considerably. This is partly due to the ill-feeling existing between the Abar and Mishm\u00ed tribes, and partly, no doubt, to the novelty of the fair having worn off. The Deputy Commissioner of Lakhimpur is generally present at this fair, and advantage is taken of the occasion to distribute presents among the chiefs.\n\nDuring the rainy season, steamers can proceed up the Brahmaputra as far as Sadiy\u00e1, and it is hoped that this place may at some future day become the starting-point of a through trade with China. It is almost certain that such a trade existed in the beginning of the last century. An Assistant Political Officer has recently been stationed at Sadiy\u00e1, to conduct political relations with the frontier tribes, especially the Abars and Mishmis.\n\n**Sadras** (correctly Satranja-patana).\u2014Town in Chengalpat taluk, Chengalpat (Chingleput) District, Madras Presidency. Situated in lat. 12\u00b0 31' 25\" N., and long. 80\u00b0 12' E., about 43 miles south of Madras, and connected with it by the Buckingham Canal. Population (1881) 1107, inhabiting 177 houses. Sadras first became a trading settlement of the Dutch in 1647, and was long famous for the fineness of the muslin produced by its looms. The Dutch erected, close to the shore, a brick fort of considerable extent and pretensions to strength, of which the ruins still remain. There are also the remains of the houses of the officials. The old Dutch cemetery is within the fort, and is still maintained in decent order under treaty. The tombstones are curious specimens of the sculptor's art. The date of the oldest is 1679. There is a German Lutheran Mission church on the esplanade opposite the fort, and the Wesleyan Mission have also a small settlement here. The once bustling importance of the place has long departed. There are still a few looms, but the cunning which produced the once famous fabrics is lost. The English captured Sadras in 1795; and although it was temporarily restored to the Dutch, it has been an English possession since 1824. The P\u00e1l\u00e1r river, which falls into the sea a few miles to the south, has silted up, and its bar cannot be crossed by seagoing ships. Sadras is now a petty place on the coast, with the open sea outside, and has long ceased to be a resort of maritime commerce.\n\n**Sadri (Large).**\u2014Town in the State of Udaipur, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na; situated 51 miles east-south-east of Udaipur city, and 23 miles south-west of N\u00edmach. Surrounded by a stone wall much out of repair, and defended\nby a small fort on the hill above, now almost in ruins. A first-class noble of the State resides here; and the town gives its name to his estate of 80 villages.\n\n**Sadri (Small).**\u2014Town in the State of Udaipur, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na; situated about 62 miles east-south-east of Udaipur city, and 13 miles south-west of Nimach. The town is walled, and great quantities of bamboos and timber from the jungles to the south are brought here or sale.\n\n**Sadrpur.**\u2014Pargan\u00e1 in S\u00edt\u00e1pur District, Oudh; bounded on the north by Bisw\u00e1n tahsil, on the east by South Kundri pargan\u00e1, on the south by Bara Banki District, and on the west by Mahm\u00fad\u00e1b\u00e1d pargan\u00e1. Area, 108 square miles, or 69,086 acres, of which 48,410 acres are cultivated, 11,600 acres cultivable, 133 acres rent-free, and 8943 uncultivable waste. The incidence of the land revenue demand is at the rate of 2s. 6\u00bdd. per acre of cultivation, 2s. 0\u00bdd. per acre of assessed area, and 1s. 10\u00bdd. per acre of total area. Population (1881) 50,233, namely, males 26,729, and females 23,504. The 160 villages comprising the pargan\u00e1 have been constituted into 114 demarcated mauz\u00e1s, of which 81 are held under t\u00e1lukd\u00e1r\u00ed and 33 under zam\u00ednd\u00e1r\u00ed tenure. Muhammadans form the principal proprietary body, owning 119 villages, Raikw\u00e1rs hold 11, Seths 5, Janw\u00e1r R\u00e1jputs 4, Panw\u00e1rs 4, Kashm\u00edr Brahmans 4. The remaining 23 are chiefly held by K\u00e1yasths. The pargan\u00e1 is a poor one, with only 2 villages containing upwards of 2000 inhabitants. No roads, no large b\u00e1z\u00e1rs, and no fairs.\n\n**Sadrpur.**\u2014Town in S\u00edt\u00e1pur District, Oudh, and head-quarters of Sadrpur pargan\u00e1; situated 30 miles south-east of S\u00edt\u00e1pur town, but with no road or river communication with any other place. An insignificant town of (1881) 1622 inhabitants. Village school; market twice a week.\n\n**Sadull\u00e1nagar.**\u2014Pargan\u00e1 in Gonda District, Oudh. Bounded on the north by Utraula pargan\u00e1, from which it is separated by the Kuw\u00e1na river; on the east by Burh\u00e1p\u00e1r\u00e1 pargan\u00e1; on the south by Manik\u00e1pur pargan\u00e1, the Bisuhi river marking the boundary line; and on the west by Gonda pargan\u00e1. The boundary rivers are fordable every few miles, except during the rains, by men and cattle, and the more important tracks are furnished with rough bridges. Along the banks of both rivers runs a fringe of forest, varying from 3 miles to a few hundred yards in breadth, but containing little good timber. The s\u00e1l trees, stunted by excessive crowding, never attain sufficient size to make them of any great value; and, except the j\u00e1mun, which is plentiful and attains a fair growth, and is of use both for building and burning, the only other tree of consequence is the mahu\u00e1, whose flowers and fruit are leased out for the manufacture of spirits and oil, and the wood\nof which is largely employed in roofing the huts of the neighbouring villages. Game is not particularly plentiful. The centre of the pargan\u00e1 is a flat ugly plain, underwooded and covered with fair cultivation, alternating with tracts of the long khar grass. The soil is of a light dry loam. Water may be found almost anywhere at a depth of from 15 to 20 feet from the surface, and irrigation is very common both from wells and small tanks. Area, 103 square miles; cultivated area, 38,943 acres, or 59 per cent. of the whole. Of this, 29,640 acres are under kharif, 22,136 acres under rabi, and 12,833 under both crops, the balance being fallow. Owing to the extent of jungle, the population is, for Oudh, sparse, numbering (1881) 40,894, or 393 persons per square mile. Hindus number 30,961, and Musalm\u00e1ns 9933.\n\nUntil quite lately, the greater part of the pargan\u00e1 was covered with dense jungle, the home of predatory bands; and most of the present tillage commenced with the purchase of parcels of land in birt from the later R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Utraula. Some idea of the scantiness of the agricultural population at the commencement of the present century, when the practice of selling birt rights became for the first time common, may be gathered from the fact that in 1815 the Government revenue was only \u00a369. From that time the advance becomes rapid and steady. In 1819 the demand had risen to \u00a31331, and ten years later it reached \u00a32406. With a few trifling variations, it remained at this amount till R\u00e1j\u00e1 Darsh\u00e1n Singh in 1838 raised it to \u00a33512, a figure which was never again attained under the Native Government. Shortly before annexation, it had fallen to little over \u00a32000; and when we took over the District, Sadull\u00e1nagar was assessed on the principle of half-profits at \u00a32408. The progress of population and agriculture since that period has been exceedingly rapid; and in 1872, by a revised assessment, the Government land revenue was raised to \u00a35607, with \u00a3152 on account of cesses. In consideration of the largeness of the enhancement, and in view of the fact that much of the land recently brought under cultivation was held on long leases at progressive rents, the increase was distributed over a period of ten years, and it was not proposed to take the full demand till 1883. Of the 112 villages in the pargan\u00e1, 51 are held by tilukd\u00e1rs, paying a revenue of \u00a32924; while 61 villages, assessed at \u00a32835, are held by zam\u00ednd\u00e1rs.\n\nSadull\u00e1nagar.\u2014Village in Gonda District, Oudh, and head-quarters of Sadull\u00e1nagar pargan\u00e1; situated 28 miles north-east of Gonda town. Lat. 27\u00b0 5' 45\" N., long. 82\u00b0 24' 51\" E. Population (1881) 781. Founded in 1786 by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Sadull\u00e1 Kh\u00e1n of the Utraula family.\n\nSadull\u00e1pur.\u2014Village in Maldah District, Bengal. The chief descent or gh\u00e1t to the holy stream of the Bhagirathi is at this place, to which the dead bodies of Hindus are brought from great distances\nto be burned. A weekly market is held here, and a large annual religious-trading fair in March, as well as on occasions of bathing festivals throughout the year. During the Muhammadan rule at Gaur, this was the only burning gh\u00e1t allowed for the Hindus in Maldah District. It is held in great veneration by the Hindus on account of its antiquity as a burning gh\u00e1t and bathing place.\n\n**Sadull\u00e1pur.**\u2014Village on the right bank of the Chen\u00e1b, in the Punjab, the scene of an indecisive action between our troops, under Sir John Thackwell, and the Sikh general Sher Singh, in January 1849.\n\n**Safed Koh (S\u00faf\u00e9d Koh, Safaid Koh).**\u2014Range of mountains in Afgh\u00e1n\u00edst\u00e1n, thus described by General Sir Charles MacGregor:\n\n\u2018The range commences to the east of the Allah-koh ridge, between K\u00e1bul and Ghazn\u00ed, and then follows $34^\\circ$ of latitude for about 75 miles to longitude $70^\\circ 35'$, when it splits into two main ridges, one going north-east to the Khaibar and the K\u00e1bul river; the other, after a short turn to the east, continuing due east to the junction of the K\u00e1bul river with the Indus. During the first portion of its course, this range drains on the north into the K\u00e1bul river and on the south into the Kuram; and it continues to do this after its separation into two branches, though not with the same regularity, some of the easternmost drainage going direct into the Indus.\n\n\u2018It is often of course quite arbitrary to say where one range commences and another ends, but I think in this case it will be best to say the Safed Koh commences from a few miles west of the Shutargardan Pass, between Kuram and Logar. This being the case, the first spur which it throws out to the north is that which forms the east watershed of the Logar river, and, dividing it from the Kh\u00fard K\u00e1bul river, ends at Bh\u00fatkhak.\n\n\u2018The next spur is that between the Kh\u00fard K\u00e1bul and the Tez\u00edn rivers, over which are the Haft Kot\u00e1l and Lataband Passes. This Wood calls the Karkacha range, or rather he confounds two distinct spurs in one under this name; but it may be doubted whether it would not more aptly be termed the Haft Kot\u00e1l spur. Wood says that the ridge he calls the Karkacha drains west into the Logar and east into the S\u00farkhab; but from Garden\u2019s surveys we now know this to be a mistake, there being two rivers\u2014the Kh\u00fard K\u00e1bul and Tez\u00edn\u2014between the Logar and S\u00farkhab, which drain into the K\u00e1bul river, and which rise in the Safed Koh. Consequently it is an error to consider the mass of mountains between the Logar and S\u00farkhab one spur. After the spur between the Kh\u00fard K\u00e1bul river and Tezin, another spur comes out from the main range, and after running north for about 30 miles to the north of Jagdalak, then turns to the east, and, running parallel with the K\u00e1bul river, ends at the junction of the S\u00farkhab with that river. This spur drains into the Tez\u00edn on the west and the S\u00farkhab on the\neast, and, after its eastward bend, into the K\u00e1b\u00fal river on the north and the S\u00farkh\u00e1b on the south.\n\n'The other northern spurs of the Safed Koh to the east are not of so marked a character, but they run between the streams which, flowing down from it, join the S\u00farkh\u00e1b or the K\u00e1b\u00fal river. Of these the principal are, commencing from the west, the Gandamak, K\u00e1r\u00e1s\u00fa, Chiprial, His\u00e1r\u00e1k, Kote, and Mohmand.\n\n'The spurs on the south of this range are not of such importance as those on the north. The first is the one which runs out from the Shutargardan Pass, and drains on the north and east into the Haz\u00e1rdarakht and Hari\u00e1b streams; on the south, into another source of the Kuram. The second is the Paiw\u00e1r ridge, which comes out from the S\u00edt\u00e1r\u00e1m Peak and ends at the Kuram, draining into the Keria and Hari\u00e1b rivers on the west and the Paiw\u00e1r on the east. Then again, to the east there are numerous short spurs, which shoot down to the south but do not reach the river, save in the form of detritus. These need not be mentioned further; and the only other spur requiring notice is the one which, coming out somewhat to the east of longitude 70\u00b0 30', runs between the Kirm\u00e1n D\u00e1ra and the Kirm\u00e1n stream.\n\n'Wood places the western limit of the Safed Koh at long. 69\u00b0 36' E., thus regarding its commencement as at very nearly the same point as I do\u2014viz. just east of the Altim\u00far Pass over the Allah-koh range, in long. 69\u00b0 30' E.\n\n'Judging from the accounts of Wood, Bellew, and Walker, the scenery would seem to be equal in grandeur and beauty on both sides of the range; and Wood in his description of the northern side falls into an error, when he says that looking towards the summit there are successive ranges, for the main range runs east and west, and throws its spurs to the north and south. Wood says the farthest peaks are bare and irregular, the nearest covered with pine-trees; and this tallies with the graphic description given by Bellew of its south aspect.\n\n'Col. Walker says of the range\u2014\"Its highest point is the S\u00edt\u00e1r\u00e1m Mountain, 15,622 feet above the sea, whence the range preserves a tolerably uniform level, perhaps nowhere less than 12,500 feet, until it again culminates in a double-peak mountain, whose summits average 14,800 feet. I have been unable to learn the local names of these peaks, or whether, like the S\u00edt\u00e1r\u00e1m Mountain, they tell of a remote antiquity, when the country was ruled by Hindus long anterior to the origin of Muhammadanism. The offshoots of this range (i.e. the branches east of long. 70\u00b0 30' E.) have usually an east and west direction, and are remarkable for their parallelism with each other and with the parent range. The most important, though not the highest, of these stretches away to Attock, and is the southern boundary of the Pesh\u00e1war valley, dividing it from the system of valleys of which Koh\u00e1t District is composed.\nBefore entering British territory, it forms the southern barrier of the T\u00edrah valley.\"\n\nAccording to Sir C. MacGregor, the low hills of Jalal\u00e1b\u00e1d (ends of the north spurs of the Safed Koh) are barren, but the lofty ranges of Kund, Karkacha, and Safed Koh are richly clad with pine, almond, and other trees. The appearance, he continues, of the valleys of the Safed Koh is a mixture of orchard, field, and garden. They abound in mulberry, pomegranate, and other fruit-trees; while the banks of their streams are edged with a fine sward, enamelled with a profusion of wild-flowers, and fringed by rows of weeping willows.\n\n\"It is worthy of note that the Safed Koh presents in its south aspect the same glacis slopes of shingle which were observed by Griffiths on the south slopes of the spurs of the Hindu Kush, and which may also be noticed on parts of the hills north of the Pesh\u00e1war valley. No mention is made by any authority of this peculiarity existing on the north of this range, or, I believe, of any other range.\"\n\n**Saffr\u00e1i.**\u2014River in Assam, rising in the N\u00e1g\u00e1 Hills, and falling into the Disang river in Sibs\u00e1g\u00e1r District, after a course of about 8\u00bd miles. Coal deposits exist near the source of the river, but the difficulties in the way of procuring labour and transport have, up to the present, prevented their being worked. Several tea-gardens are situated on the banks or in the vicinity of the river, which is navigable for boats of 50 maunds, or about two tons burthen, during the rainy season as far as the Dhodar Ali road.\n\n**Safipur.**\u2014Tahsil or Sub-division of Unao District, Oudh, lying between 26\u00b0 37' and 27\u00b0 2' N. lat., and between 80\u00b0 6' and 80\u00b0 30' E. long. Bounded on the north by Bilgr\u00e1m and Sand\u00edla tahsils of Hardoi District, on the east by Mohan tahsil of Unao, on the south by Unao tahsil, and on the west by Cawnpur District in the North-Western Provinces. Area, 395 square miles, of which 231 are cultivated. Population, according to the Census of 1881, 194,001, of whom 169,733 are Hindus, and 24,254 Muhammadans. Number of males, 102,889; of females, 91,112; number of villages or towns, 373; average density of population, 491 persons per square mile. This tahsil comprises the three pargan\u00e1s of Safipur, Fatehpur Chaur\u00e1si, and B\u00e1ngarmau. In 1883 it contained 1 criminal and 2 civil courts; number of police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), 2; strength of regular police, 47 men; rural police or village watchmen (chaukidd\u00e1rs), 634.\n\n**Safipur.**\u2014Pargan\u00e1 of Unao District, Oudh. Bounded on the north by Sand\u00edla pargan\u00e1 of Hardoi District, from which it is separated by the S\u00e1i river; on the east by As\u00edw\u00e1n Ras\u00fal\u00e1b\u00e1d; on the south by Pariar; and on the east by Fatehpur Chaur\u00e1si. Area, 132 square miles, or 84,530 acres, divided into 137 townships. A well-wooded country. Soil chiefly loam and clay; staple crop, barley. Government revenue\n\u00a310,567, at an average rate of 2s. 6d. per acre. Population (1881) 68,258, namely, males 35,811, and females 32,447. Hindus number 59,151; Muhammadans, 9093; and 'others,' 14. The extent of land held under the different varieties of tenure is as follows:\u2014Tilukdari, 4249 acres; Pukhtadari, 240 acres; Patidari, 37,168 acres; Zamindari, 36,181 acres; Bhayachara, 5531 acres; and Government villages, 1158 acres. Four large annual fairs, at one of which 15,000 persons assemble.\n\nSafipur (or S\u00e1ipur).\u2014Town in Unao District, Oudh, and headquarters of Safipur tahsil and pargan\u00e1; situated in lat. 26\u00b0 44' 10\" N., and long. 80\u00b0 23' 15\" E., 17 miles north-west of Unao town, on the road leading thence to Hardoi. A flourishing, well-built town, containing 89 masonry houses, 14 mosques, and 6 Hindu temples. Population (1881) 7031, namely, Hindus, 4137; Musalmans, 2880; and 'others,' 14. Daily market, with sales averaging \u00a35500 a year. Flourishing school; police station. The town is said to have been originally founded by S\u00e1i Sukal, a Br\u00e1hman, and is generally called after him, S\u00e1ipur. A religious mendicant subsequently came to the town, and was buried there, and the name was changed to Safipur in commemoration of the holy man. S\u00e1i Sukal is said to have been defeated and killed in 1389 by Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm of Jaunpur, who put his lieutenants in charge of the town, and whose descendants are the principal proprietors at the present day.\n\nS\u00e1gar (Saugor).\u2014District in the Chief Commissionership of the Central Provinces, lying between 23\u00b0 4' and 24\u00b0 27' N. lat., and between 78\u00b0 6' and 79\u00b0 12' E. long. Area, 4005 square miles. Population in 1881, 564,950 souls. S\u00e1gar is a District of the Jabalpur Division, lying in the extreme north-west of the Central Provinces. It is bounded on the north by L\u00e1litpur District of the North-Western Provinces and the Native States of Bij\u00e1war, Pann\u00e1, and Charkh\u00e1r\u00ed; on the east by Pann\u00e1 and Damoh District; on the south by Narsinghpur District and the Native States of Bhop\u00e1l; and on the west by Bhop\u00e1l and Gwalior States. The administrative head-quarters are at S\u00c1GAR TOWN.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The District of S\u00e1gar occupies, with that of Damoh, the high Vindhyan table-land which stretches out in the north-west corner of the Central Provinces. The scarp of the Bh\u00e1nrer range, rising abruptly from the valley of the Narbad\u00e1 (Nerbudda), forms a natural boundary line, from which the District extends northwards in a vast plain broken here and there by hills, with a general slope towards the north-east. So, too, east of S\u00e1gar town the boundary is marked by a clear escarpment, but to the north and west no salient physical feature indicates the limits of the District.\n\nThe country is for the most part covered with trap; but on the\nnorth, the Vindhyan sandstone runs down, broadening out opposite Kur\u00e1i and gradually disappearing southwards; and on the east, the sandstone occupies a tract about 20 miles long and 5 broad, reaching from Garh\u00e1kota to beyond Surkhi. Garh\u00e1kota itself and a narrow strip of country as far south as Rehl\u00ed rest on limestone. The form of the trap hills distinguishes them at once from the inlying hills of sandstone; their vegetation is also distinct, and the teak saplings which flourish on the trap rarely grow on the sandstone. The soil in the north and east of the District is a reddish-brown alluvium. The south and centre are covered with black soil, on which wheat is grown in large quantities. But the cultivated plains are broken up by hills, rising singly or in groups, and by small ranges and plateaux, some of them covered with jungle, others stony and barren.\n\nThe principal streams are the Sun\u00e1r, Beas (Bi\u00e1s), Dh\u00fap\u00e1n, and B\u00edn\u00e1, all flowing in a northerly direction towards the valley of the Ganges. S\u00e1g\u00e1r, however, contains no river of importance. Though several densely wooded tracts exist in the District, they yield no great quantity of the finer sorts of timber. The largest forest, the Ramn\u00e1, a preserve to the north-east of Garh\u00e1kota, covering 8 square miles, produces teak and s\u00e1j. Smaller forests to the south of the District, as Mohl\u00ed near Rehl\u00ed, and Tarh\u00e1 K\u00eds\u00edl\u00ed near Deor\u00ed, supply teak, s\u00e1j, and bamboos. Towards the north, in Sh\u00e1hgarh, lie large tracts of wooded country, comprising mahu\u00e1 and s\u00e1j, with some teak, and bamboos in abundance. About 2 square miles of this region form the Tigor\u00e1 reserve. The mineral wealth of the District is insignificant; but iron-ore, of excellent quality, found near H\u00edr\u00e1pur, a small village in the extreme north-east, affords occupation to a few smelting furnaces of the rudest character. In many parts, also, sandstone, well suited for building purposes, abounds.\n\nHistory.\u2014The formation of S\u00e1g\u00e1r into a District rests on no historical considerations. Until quite recent times, semi-independent rulers of small tracts have co-existed at various places; and while the southern half was governed from Rehl\u00ed, the northern half was subject to Dh\u00e1mon\u00ed or Sh\u00e1hgarh. Rehl\u00ed, a village situated on elevated ground about 26 miles south-east of S\u00e1g\u00e1r town, appears to have been originally held by the Gonds, to whom succeeded a race of shepherds, known as Baladeos. The Baladeos first settled at Khamaria, a village a mile off, but in time they removed to Rehl\u00ed, where they built a fort. The place next passed into the hands of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Chhatar S\u00e1l, the Bundel\u00e1 chief of Pann\u00e1, who made it over to B\u00e1ji R\u00e1o Peshw\u00e1, in return for assistance in a war with the Sub\u00e1h of Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d. The Peshw\u00e1 built the fort which now exists. The town of S\u00e1g\u00e1r, after a similar history, at this time formed part of the dominions of Chhatar S\u00e1l. That chieftain died in 1735; and in addition to his previous gift to the Peshw\u00e1, left him\none-third of his kingdom, including S\u00e1gar town and a considerable portion of the present District. The territory thus acquired continued to be managed by agents of the Peshw\u00e1 until 1818, when, on the downfall of the Peshw\u00e1's government, the southern part of S\u00e1gar District came under British rule.\n\nThe country to the north appears to have belonged to the great Gond kingdom of Mandla; and Dh\u00e1mon\u00ed, 28 miles north of S\u00e1gar town, owes its origin to a scion of that line, named Surat S\u00e1. About the end of the 16th century, R\u00e1j\u00e1 Barsingh Deva, the Bundel\u00e1 chief of the neighbouring State of Orchh\u00e1, defeated Surat S\u00e1; and made Dh\u00e1mon\u00ed the capital, from which he ruled the northern part of the District. His son Pah\u00e1r Singh continued in power till 1619, when the country became a portion of the Delhi Empire. During the eighty years of Muhammadan rule which followed, Garola, Kur\u00e1i, and Khiml\u00e1sa rose to be places of importance. A succession of five governors from Delhi administered Northern S\u00e1gar, until about 1700, at the time of the decline of the Mughal Empire, the last of them, Naw\u00e1b Gh\u00e1irat Kh\u00e1n, was defeated by Chhatar S\u00e1l, who thus for a short time united nearly the whole of the District under one rule. Dh\u00e1mon\u00ed remained under his descendants until 1802, when Umr\u00e1o Singh, R\u00e1j\u00e1 of the neighbouring village of Patan, gained the fort by treachery. Six months, however, had not passed when he was himself defeated by the army of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of N\u00e1gpur, who annexed the country. In 1818, after the flight of Ap\u00e1 S\u00e1hib, Dh\u00e1mon\u00ed was taken by a British force under General Marshall.\n\nThough Sh\u00e1hgarh, 40 miles north-east of S\u00e1gar, came under British rule at a later period, its history is similar to that of Dh\u00e1mon\u00ed. Originally part of the Gond kingdom of Mandl\u00e1, Sh\u00e1hgarh also was seized by a Bundel\u00e1 chieftain, Sh\u00e1hman, who about 1650 killed Chint\u00e1man, the last Gond ruler. The line of Sh\u00e1hman ended in 1798, when his descendant Kh\u00e1nj\u00fa was defeated by Mardan Singh, R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Garh\u00e1kota. In 1842, the son of Mardan Singh was succeeded by a nephew named Bakht Bal\u00ed. This year was signalized by the outbreak known as the Bundel\u00e1 insurrection. Jaw\u00e1hir Singh of Chandrapur, being sued on account of decrees of the Civil Court, broke into open rebellion, and burned and plundered the towns of Khiml\u00e1sa, Kur\u00e1i, Naraol\u00ed, Dh\u00e1mon\u00ed, and Bin\u00e1ik\u00e1. On hearing this, Delan S\u00e1, a Gond chief living in the south of the District, also rose, and plundered Deor\u00ed and the surrounding country. The insurrection was quelled in the following year, chiefly through the efforts of Captain Hamilton; and Lord Ellenborough broke up the administration of the S\u00e1gar and Narbad\u00e1 territories, and reorganized it on an entirely new footing.\n\nIn 1857 occurred the great rebellion, which led to the downfall of the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Sh\u00e1hgarh. In June, when the Mutiny began, the regiments\nstationed at S\u00e1gar were the 31st Native Infantry, commanded by Major Hampden, and the 42nd, commanded by Colonel Dalzell, with the 3rd Irregular Cavalry, and a few European gunners. The entire force was under the command of Brigadier Sage. On the 27th June, the officers, with the European artillery and residents of the station, by order of the Brigadier moved into the fort, taking all the arms they could collect, and the treasure from the District office. Shortly afterwards, the 42nd and the cavalry mutinied, and burned a good many houses, besides seizing all the treasure that had been left. The 31st, however, remained loyal, and made a demonstration against the mutineers, many of whom made off towards Sh\u00e1hgarh. When the news of the rising got abroad, Mardan Singh, R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Bh\u00e1npur, took possession of the present Subdivision of Kur\u00e1i; Bakht Bali, the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Sh\u00e1hgarh, seized Band\u00ed, Rehl\u00ed, and Garh\u00e1kota; and Adil Muhammad, Naw\u00e1b of Garhi Am\u00e1pan\u00ed, occupied R\u00e1hatgarh. In fact, these three divided the whole District between them. For eight months, affairs remained in this state; and while the fort and town of S\u00e1gar were held by the Europeans, the whole surrounding country was in possession of the rebels. The latter never attacked the fort, and three engagements with the English forces at S\u00e1gar proved indecisive. At length, in February 1858, Sir Hugh Rose arrived with the Central India Field Force at R\u00e1hatgarh, where, after totally defeating Adil Muhammad, he took and partially destroyed the fort. He next defeated the troops of Mardan Singh at Barodi\u00e1 Naunagar, and having cleared the country round R\u00e1hatgarh and Kur\u00e1i, marched to S\u00e1gar. Sir Hugh Rose then advanced to Garh\u00e1kota, where he routed the followers of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Sh\u00e1hgarh, and seized the fort, in which the rebels had left a large quantity of treasure. Soon after, he met the remainder of Bakht Bali\u2019s forces at Madanpur, and defeated them with great slaughter. By the beginning of March 1858, order was re-established throughout the District. The dominions of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Sh\u00e1hgarh were confiscated, and a portion of them added to the District of S\u00e1gar. Bakht Bali gave himself up, under the amnesty, at Maraur\u00e1, and was sent as a State prisoner to Lahore.\n\nPopulation.\u2014A rough enumeration in 1866 returned the population of S\u00e1gar at 498,642. The Census of 1872 returned a total population of 527,725; while the last enumeration in 1881 returned 564,950, showing an increase of 37,225, or 7\u00b05 per cent., in nine years, of which 2\u00b083 per cent. represents the excess of registered births over deaths, while the remainder may be assigned to immigration. The results arrived at by the Census of 1881 may be summarized as follows:\u2014Area of District, 4005 square miles; towns 5, and villages 1837; number of houses, 155,711, namely, occupied 130,409, and unoccupied 25,302. Total population, 564,950, namely, males 294,795, and females 270,155; proportion of males, 52\u00b02 per cent. Average density of\npopulation, 141 persons per square mile; towns or villages per square mile, .46; persons per town or village, 307; houses per square mile, 32.56; persons per occupied house, 4.33. Classified according to sex and age, there are\u2014under 15 years of age, males 114,422, and females 102,481; total children, 216,903, or 38.5 per cent. of the District population: 15 years and upwards, males 180,373, and females 167,674; total adults, 348,047, or 61.5 per cent.\n\nReligion.\u2014Classified according to religion, the population of S\u00e1gar District consists of\u2014Hindus, 498,071, or 88.2 per cent.; Muhammadans, 25,396, or 4.5 per cent.; Jains, 16,432, or 2.9 per cent.; Kab\u00edranth\u00eds, 4606; Satn\u00e1m\u00eds, 245; Christians, 1034; P\u00e1rs\u00eds, 15; Sikhs, 5; Buddhists 2; and tribes professing aboriginal religions, 19,144, or 3.4 per cent. of the population. The total aboriginal population by race, as apart from religion, however, is returned at 45,699, or 8.1 per cent., consisting almost entirely of Gonds (29,407) and Saur\u00e1s (16,109).\n\nAmong the recognised Hindu castes, Br\u00e1hmans number 45,408; R\u00e1jputs, 18,417; Bh\u00e1ts, 1983; K\u00e1yasths, 5453; and Baniy\u00e1s, 6301. The lower-class Hindus, who comprise the great mass of the population, include the following castes\u2014Cham\u00e1r, 66,637; Lodh\u00ed, 45,053; Kachh\u00ed, 42,888; Ah\u00edr, 30,197; Kurm\u00ed, 25,921; Chand\u00e1l, 14,757; Teli, 14,299; N\u00e1\u00ed, 13,580; Kor\u00ed, 12,545; Dhim\u00e1r, 12,203; Loh\u00e1r, 9470; Basor, 9249; Kumbh\u00e1r, 8514; Dhab\u00ed, 7844; Barh\u00e1i, 6018; Son\u00e1r, 5233; Gad\u00e1ri\u00e1, 3807; Kall\u00e1r, 3626; Darzi, 3696; M\u00e1l\u00ed, 1464; and Kosht\u00ed, 1147. The Muhammadan population, classified according to sect, comprise\u2014Sunnis, 23,960; Shi\u00e1s, 503; Wah\u00e1b\u00eds, 14; and unspecified, 919. Of 1034 Christians, Europeans number 530; Eurasians, 56; Natives of India, 410; and unspecified, 38. By sect, Roman Catholics number 469; Church of England, 427; Presbyterians, 85; Lutherans, 13; Wesleyans, 4; others and unspecified, 36. A station of the Lutheran Mission was established at S\u00e1gar in 1878.\n\nThe best cultivators are the Kurm\u00eds, who immigrated from the Do\u00e1b about the beginning of the 17th century; and the Lodh\u00eds, who made their way to the Vindhyan table-land during the time of Aurangzeb. Though not tall, the inhabitants of S\u00e1gar are for the most part a sturdy race. The simple white cloth made in the country forms the dress in the hot season of the poorer classes. In the cold weather, they wear a thick cotton-padded coat, reaching below the knees. The favourite colour is the green mahu\u00e1, more particularly in the north of the District bordering on Bundelkhand, where green is regarded as the national colour. Cloth dyed with \u00e1l or madder is also much worn, especially by females. In the south, the population are peaceful and tractable. But towards the north, their character undergoes a change for the worse; and the Kor\u00eds, a small caste dwelling on the borders near Native States, where they find protection if pressed by the police,\nshare with another caste called Khangars a notoriety for crime. No explanation can be given of the fact that S\u00e1gar contains more than one-third of the total number of the Jains in the Central Provinces. The prevailing language is Hindi, but Urdu is also spoken.\n\nTown and Rural Population.\u2014S\u00e1gar District contains five towns with a population exceeding five thousand inhabitants, namely, S\u00e1gar, population (1881) 44,416; Garhakota, 11,414; Deori, 7414; Khurai, 5370; and Rehli, 5230. The urban population thus disclosed amounts to 73,844, or 13.1 per cent. of the District total. The foregoing towns are municipalities, with a total income in 1882-83 of \u00a37491, of which \u00a35872 was derived from taxation, mainly octroi duties; average incidence of taxation, 1s. 7d. per head of the population within municipal limits. The 1837 villages below five thousand inhabitants are thus classified\u20141024 contain less than two hundred inhabitants; 575 between two and five hundred; 174 between five hundred and a thousand; 53 between one and two thousand; 10 between two and three thousand; and 1 between three and five thousand inhabitants.\n\nAs regards occupation, the Census Report divides the male population into the following six classes:\u2014(1) Professional, military, and official class, 7850; (2) domestic class, including inn and lodging-house keepers, etc., 3686; (3) commercial class, including bankers, merchants, traders, carriers, etc., 6861; (4) agricultural and pastoral class, including gardeners, 98,488; (5) manufacturing and industrial class, including all artisans, 46,590; and (6) indefinite, non-productive, and unspecified class, comprising general labourers and male children, 28,314.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Of the total area of 4005 square miles, only 1396 square miles were cultivated in 1883-84, while of the portion lying waste, 1220 square miles were returned as cultivable and 1389 square miles as uncultivable; 4519 acres were irrigated, entirely by private enterprise. Of the total area, however, 1007 square miles are held revenue-free, leaving 2998 square miles liable to Government assessment, of which 1412 square miles were cultivated in 1883-84; 940 square miles were available for cultivation, and 646 square miles uncultivable. Wheat forms the staple crop of the District, grown in 1883 on 527,424 acres. Rice was grown on only 11,084 acres, while other food-grains were grown on 236,414 acres. Oil-seeds occupied 69,524 acres; cotton, 32,705 acres; and sugar-cane, 3784 acres. The agricultural stock in 1883-84 consisted of\u2014Cows, bullocks, and buffaloes, 289,379; horses, 4635; ponies, 14,024; donkeys, 3086; sheep and goats, 29,897; and pigs, 5502; while carts numbered 20,037, and ploughs 56,049. Cattle and buffaloes are bred to a large extent in the District, both for draught and carriage, and also for dairy purposes, especially the manufacture of ghi; and lately some bulls have been imported from Hiss\u00e1r and Mysore,\nto improve the indigenous breed. The stock of sheep is small, and insufficient even for home consumption. The Cham\u00e1rs and Gonds eat flesh when they get it, and are not particular about its condition. Wheat, barley, and d\u00e1l form the food of the richer inhabitants; the poorer classes content themselves with b\u00e1jra, kodo, kutki, and often in seasons of scarcity subsist on the mahu\u00e1 and other jungle fruits.\n\nOf the adult male and female agricultural population in 1881 (namely 149,732), 7749 were returned as landed proprietors, 29,456 as tenants possessing rights of occupancy, 41,526 as tenants-at-will, 15,638 as assistants in home cultivation, 5991 as agricultural labourers, while the remainder is made up of graziers, tenants of unspecified status, estate agents, etc. Area of cultivated and cultivable land available for each adult agriculturist, 11'3 acres. The rent rates per acre for the different qualities of land in 1883 are returned as follows:\u2014Land suited for wheat, 3s. 10\u00bdd.; inferior grains, 2s. 1\u00bdd.; oil-seeds, 2s. 7\u00bdd.; cotton, 2s. 7d.; rice, 4s. 9d.; sugar-cane, 5s. 9d. Total amount of Government assessment, including local rates and cesses levied on land, \u00a347,339, or an average of 1s. 0\u00bdd. per cultivated acre. Total rental paid by cultivators, \u00a3116,000, or an average of 2s. 5\u00bdd. per cultivated acre. The ordinary prices of produce per cwt. were as follows:\u2014Wheat, 4s. 2d.; linseed, 9s. 9d.; cotton, 30s. 9d.; rice, 9s. 6d.; sugar (g\u00far), 12s. 3d. The wages per diem for skilled labour averaged 9d.; for unskilled labour, 3\u00bed.\n\nCommerce and Trade.\u2014S\u00e1g\u00e1r is not the seat of any important manufacture. Large cattle fairs are held weekly at Kur\u00e1i, and once a year at Garh\u00e1kota. The other principal fairs take place at Bh\u00e1pel, Pandalpur, and Rang\u00edr. The iron-ore, smelted near Hir\u00e1pur, goes principally to Cawnpur; but the chief export of the District consists of grain sent to Karel\u00ed and other stations on the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, for conveyance to Bombay. Principal imports\u2014sugar and kir\u00e1na, or grocery, from M\u00edrz\u00e1pur; and English cloth and piece-goods from M\u00edrz\u00e1pur, and from Bombay by way of Karel\u00ed. The town of S\u00e1g\u00e1r was formerly the entrep\u00f4t of the salt trade with R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. In 1883, 50 miles of made roads within the District were returned as of the \u2018first\u2019 class, 63 of the \u2018second,\u2019 and 21 of the \u2018third\u2019 class. The main lines of communication are\u2014the road from Jabalpur via Damoh to S\u00e1g\u00e1r, and thence via R\u00e1hatgarh towards Indore, with travellers\u2019 bungalows at S\u00e1g\u00e1r and R\u00e1hatgarh; the road from Gwalior via Jh\u00e1ns\u00ed and L\u00e1l\u00edtpur to S\u00e1g\u00e1r, and thence towards Narsinghpur; the road from S\u00e1g\u00e1r in a north-easterly direction towards Cawnpur, with a travellers\u2019 bungalow at Sh\u00e1hgarh; and the road from S\u00e1g\u00e1r in a north-westerly direction to Sironj in Sindhia\u2019s territory, and Mhow via Kur\u00e1i. None of these roads is bridged and metalled throughout. A road connecting S\u00e1g\u00e1r with the Great Indian Peninsula Railway at Karel\u00ed, and crossing\nthe Narbad\u00e1 (Nerbudda) at the Birm\u00e1n Gh\u00e1t, has been recently opened for traffic, and now forms the chief line of communication in the District. The District has no means of communication by water or rail.\n\nAdministration.\u2014In 1861, S\u00e1g\u00e1r was formed into a separate District of the British Government of the Central Provinces. It is administered by a Deputy Commissioner, with Assistants and tahsild\u00e1rs. Total revenue in 1883\u201384, \u00a368,376, of which the land yielded \u00a344,429. Total cost of District officials and police of all kinds, \u00a37586: number of civil and revenue judges of all sorts within the District, 12; magistrates, 10: maximum distance from any village to the nearest court, 28 miles; average distance, 26 miles: number of police, District and town, 715, being 1 policeman to every 5\u00b76 square miles and every 785 inhabitants. The daily average number of convicts in jail in 1883 was 127, of whom 13 were females. The number of Government or aided schools in the District under Government inspection in 1883\u201384 was 92, attended by 6145 pupils. The Census Report of 1881 returned 5625 boys and 592 girls as under instruction; besides 14,199 males and 416 females able to read and write, but not under instruction.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014Through the greater part of the District the climate is considered moderate. Temperature in the shade in 1883 at the civil station\u2014May, highest reading 111\u00b75\u00b0 F., lowest 67\u00b0 F.; July, highest 91\u00b75\u00b0 F., lowest 71\u00b0 F.; December, highest 79\u00b0 F., lowest 44\u00b0 F. The average annual rainfall is 45\u00b77 inches, but in 1883 only 32\u00b766 inches fell. Storms are rarely of such severity as to injure the crops. The prevalent disease of the District is an intermittent fever, which comes on after the rains, especially during the month of October. Bowel complaints also cause many deaths. In 1883, eight charitable dispensaries afforded medical relief to 57,402 in-door and out-door patients. The reported death-rate in the same year amounted to 36\u00b768 per thousand of the population, as against an average of 40\u00b780 per thousand for the previous five years.

N. H. Maclean (published 1867); the Census Report of the Central Provinces for 1881; and the several annual Administration and Departmental Reports of the Central Provinces Government.]\n\nS\u00e1g\u00e1r (Saugor).\u2014The central tahsil or Sub-division of S\u00e1g\u00e1r (Saugor) District, Central Provinces, lying between 23\u00b0 5' and 23\u00b0 56' N. lat., and between 78\u00b0 37' and 79\u00b0 21' E. long. Area, 1067 square miles, with 1 town and 497 villages, and 46,640 houses. Population (1881) 196,980, namely, males 102,017, and females 94,963;\naverage density of population, 184.6 persons per square mile. The total adult agricultural population (male and female) numbers 36,490, with an average area of 13 acres of cultivated and cultivable land to each. Of the total area of the tahsil (1067 square miles), 158 square miles are held revenue-free, while 909 square miles are assessed for Government revenue, of which 433 square miles are cultivated, 242 square miles available for cultivation, and 234 square miles uncultivated waste. Total amount of Government land revenue, including local rates and cesses, \u00a316,363, or an average of 1s. 2\u00bdd. per cultivated acre; amount of rental paid by cultivators, including rates and cesses, \u00a334,592, or an average of 2s. 4\u00bed. per cultivated acre. S\u00e1gar tahsil contained in 1883, 6 civil and 9 criminal courts (including the District head-quarter courts), with 4 police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), and 9 outpost stations (chauk\u00eds), a regular police force numbering 118 men, and a village watch or rural police of 452 chaukid\u00e1rs.\n\nS\u00e1gar (Saugor). \u2014 Principal town and head-quarters of S\u00e1gar (Saugor) District, Central Provinces. Lat. 23\u00b0 49' 50\" N., long. 78\u00b0 48' 45\" E. S\u00e1gar stands 1940 feet above sea-level, on the borders of a fine lake nearly a mile broad, from which it derives its name. The lake is said to be an ancient Banj\u00e1ra work; but the present city is only about two centuries old, and owes its rise to a Bundel\u00e1 R\u00e1j\u00e1, who built a small fort on the site of the present structure in 1660, and founded a village called Parkot\u00e1, now a quarter of the modern town. S\u00e1gar was next held by Chhatar S\u00e1l, and formed part of the territory left by him on his death to his ally the Peshwa. Govind Pandit was appointed by the Peshw\u00e1 to administer the country; and his descendants continued to manage it till shortly before it was ceded to the British Government by Peshw\u00e1 B\u00e1j\u00ed R\u00e1o in 1818. During this period the town was twice plundered by Am\u00edr Kh\u00e1n and his army, and again by Sindhia in 1804. During the Mutiny of 1857, the town and fort were held by the English for eight months, during which time the whole of the surrounding country was in possession of the rebels, until the arrival of Sir Hugh Rose.\n\nS\u00e1gar town is well built, with wide streets; and the large bathing gh\u00e1ts on the banks of the lake, for the most part surrounded with Hindu temples, add much to its appearance. S\u00e1gar was formerly the entrep\u00f4t of the salt trade with R\u00e1jput\u00e1na, and still carries on a large trade with M\u00edrz\u00e1pur, importing sugar and kir\u00e1na, or grocery, besides English cloth. Population (1881) 44,416, namely, males 22,556, and females 21,860. Classified according to religion, Hindus number 32,490; Muhammadans, 8992; Jains, 1144; Kab\u00edranth\u00eds, 699; Satn\u00e1m\u00eds, 88; Christians, 975; P\u00e1rs\u00eds, 15; Sikhs, 4; and non-Hindu aborigines, 9. Municipal income (1882-83), \u00a34377, of which \u00a33892 was derived from octroi; average incidence of taxation, 1s. 9d. per head.\nThe existing fort at S\u00e1gar was completed by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s about a century ago, on an older site. It stands on a height north-west of the lake, commanding the whole of the city and surrounding country, and consists of 20 round towers, varying from 20 to 40 feet in height, connected by thick curtain walls. It encloses a space of 6 acres, for the most part covered with old Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 buildings two storeys high. The British Government have constructed a magazine, a large building now used for medical stores, and a barrack for the European guard. The only entrance is on the east side. In 1829, a large building was erected for a mint, about a mile east of the lake, where 400 men were employed in coining; but after ten or twelve years, the business was transferred to Calcutta. The building is now used as the tahs\u00edli, and as the office of the Executive Engineer. Other edifices of importance are a large castellated jail, capable of containing 500 prisoners, situated about half a mile east of the lake, and built in 1846 at a cost of \u00a35000; the Deputy Commissioner's Court, on a hill overlooking the city and lake, built about 1820; the Sessions Court-house, a little to the north, built in 1863 at a cost of \u00a3500; and the city kotw\u00e1l\u00ed or station-house, under the western walls of the fort, built in 1856. S\u00e1gar had formerly a high school, affiliated to the Calcutta University, established about 1828 by Captain James Paton, of the Bengal Artillery, with the assistance of R\u00e1o Krishna R\u00e1o, a Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 gentleman. The high school has since been removed to Jabalpur, and has been replaced by a zil\u00e1 school. The town also contains a vernacular middle-class school, several indigenous schools, and 5 girls' schools. In 1862, an unhealthy swamp lying north-east of the lake, which cut off the quarter called Gop\u00e1lganj from the rest of the city, was converted into a large garden, with numerous drives and a piece of ornamental water, at a cost of \u00a33000. The civil station begins with the mint, about a mile east of the lake, and extends northwards for a mile, till joined by the military cantonments, which extend in a north-easterly direction for 2\u00bd miles, with the church in the centre. Before the Mutiny, the cantonments were exclusively garrisoned by Native troops, with a detail of European artillery. Since then, however, a European regiment and two batteries of European artillery, with a Native regiment of cavalry and one of infantry, have been stationed at S\u00e1gar. The fort contains a large magazine, and depot of medical stores.\n\nS\u00e1gar (Saugor).\u2014Island at the mouth of the H\u00fagl\u00ed river, Bengal. Lat. 21\u00b0 35' 30\" to 21\u00b0 56' 30\" N., long. 88\u00b0 4' 30\" to 88\u00b0 14' E. A great fair is held on the island about the middle of January, to which a large gathering of pilgrims, mostly women, from all parts of Bengal, with some from other parts of India, resort to wash away their sins in the waters of the holy stream. The religious ceremonies last for three\ndays, but the fair is continued for a longer period; a considerable trade is carried on in articles brought from Calcutta, mats from Eastern Bengal, and stoneware platters and cups principally from Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur. At other times the island is very sparsely inhabited, though it is said to have been once well peopled. A writer in the *Calcutta Review* even asserts that 'two years before the foundation of Calcutta it contained a population of 200,000 persons, who in one night, in 1688, were swept away by an inundation.' S\u00e1gar Island has now been partially reclaimed, but the greater part is still covered with dense jungle, and infested by tigers and other wild beasts. Many attempts have been made to cultivate it, but until recently with small success. The Board of Revenue tried in 1813 to lease it to natives, but the attempt failed, and the island was subsequently taken over by an association, composed of Europeans and natives, rent-free for thirty years, and at a quit-rent of 1s. 6d. per acre thereafter. Previous to this, the island had been surveyed (1812) and found to contain 143,265 acres of dry land. Sub-leases were afterwards granted to several persons, but their efforts to clear the land were ineffectual.\n\nDuring the years 1875\u201377, six allotments in the island were leased out by Government for a period of years free of revenue, on condition that special protective works against inundation, to be approved by Government, should be constructed and maintained by the grantees. The works have been carried out, and cultivation is once more spreading over these lands, which still form the subject of an annual inquiry.\n\nSalt manufacture was conducted on the island for some time, but has been almost discontinued.\n\nThe only buildings of any importance in S\u00e1gar Island are the lighthouse, which was commenced as long ago as 1808, and the telegraph office at the north of the island. The Meteorological Department has an observatory on the south-west extremity of the island. The telegraph station lies below high-water mark, and is protected by a strong dyke. The average rainfall for the fifteen years ending 1881 was 73\u00b785 inches. The cyclone of 1864 caused enormous destruction and loss of life on S\u00e1gar Island. The storm-wave, 11 feet above the level of the land, swept over the island with resistless force. At first it was reported that 90 per cent. of the population had perished; but it was afterwards ascertained that 1,488 persons survived on the island out of a population, before the cyclone, of 5,625.\n\n**S\u00e1gar.**\u2014T\u00e1luk in Shimoga District, Mysore State. Area, 663 square miles, of which 83, including in\u00e1ms, are cultivated. Population (1871) 60,231; (1881) 59,210, namely, males 32,237, and females 26,973. Hindus number 54,277; Muhammadans, 1,621; Jains, 3,190; and Christians, 122. Land revenue (1881), excluding local cesses, \u00a321,196; assessment per cultivated acre, 7s. 10\u00bdd. S\u00e1gar t\u00e1luk\noccupies the most westerly portion of Mysore, broken by the spurs of the Gh\u00e1ts, and in parts only 8 miles distant from the sea. A great part of the area is overgrown with heavy timber-trees, interspersed with grassy glades, amid which wander herds of bison and wild elephant. Products\u2014areca-nut, rice, pepper, and cardamoms.\n\nS\u00e1g\u00e1r.\u2014Municipal town in Shimoga District, Mysore State; situated in lat. 14\u00b0 9' 50\" N., and long. 75\u00b0 4' 20\" E., on the left bank of the Varada river, 40 miles west-north-west of Shimoga town. Headquarters of S\u00e1g\u00e1r t\u00e1luk. Population (1881) 2284; municipal revenue (1881-82), \u00a3223; rate of taxation, rs. 11\u00bdd. per head. A centre of the areca-nut trade, and the residence of some wealthy merchants. Areca-nut, pepper, sandal-wood, and products of the highlands are exchanged for cotton cloth and other articles from the seaboard.\n\nS\u00e1gargarh (S\u00e1gargad or the 'Sea Fort').\u2014Fortified hill and health resort in Kol\u00e1ba District, Bombay Presidency. Situated 19 miles south of Bombay city, and 6 east of Al\u00edb\u00e1gh, 1357 feet above sea-level. The spur on which S\u00e1gargarh fort is built holds a somewhat central position in the range of hills that forms the backbone of Al\u00edb\u00e1gh Sub-division. On the east, south, and north it rises steeply from the forests and rice lands below. To the north-west and west, beyond a narrow neck, it stretches a bare waving hill-top about two miles long and half a mile to a mile broad. Its height and nearness to the sea make it pleasantly cool during the latter part of the hot weather. There are two main roads to S\u00e1gargarh from the east and from the west. From the citadel the chief view is the sea to the north-west, west, and south-west. To the south is a rice plain; and beyond the plain rise the bare Cheul hills. To the north stretches the Bombay harbour, the Prongs lighthouse, and Kol\u00e1ba. The chief buildings on the hill are two European bungalows.\n\nSagr\u00ed.\u2014North-eastern tahsil of Azamgarh District, North-Western Provinces, lying along the south bank of the river Gogra, and comprising the four pargan\u00e1s of Sagr\u00ed, Gop\u00e1lpur, Ghosi, and Nath\u00fapur. The greater part of the country consists of good b\u00e1ngar land; but the kachh\u00e1r country, inundated by the Gogra and the Little Sarju or Tons, constitutes a considerable portion of its area, chiefly in the centre and the north-east. Gop\u00e1lpur and Sagr\u00ed pargan\u00e1s in the west are watered by the Little Sarju; and in the eastern half of the tahsil there are a few streams which feed several large lakes or marshes, of which the principal are the Pakri Pew\u00e1 T\u00e1l in Ghosi, and the Ratoi T\u00e1l in Nath\u00fapur pargan\u00e1. Only about one-fourth of the cultivated area in Gop\u00e1lpur and Sagr\u00ed pargan\u00e1s is rice land. In the b\u00e1ngar country, all kinds of spring crops can be raised. In the saturated kachh\u00e1r tracts, a peculiar crop is a variety of rice known as sokan, which seems unable to grow elsewhere. Peas, vetches, and other rabi crops are grown after\nthe rice crop has been harvested. In the tracts nearest the rivers, barley and peas, and in places sugar-cane, are grown; but the other khar\u00edf crops, owing to the liability to injury from floods, rarely turn out well. Throughout the kachh\u00e1r, the swamps and old beds of the Gogra and Little Sarju are filled with tinni or wild rice. In the b\u00e1ngar the usual rab\u00ed crops are grown along with sugar-cane, which is not, however, so profitable a crop here as elsewhere. A little poppy is grown in favourable places throughout the tahs\u00edl. The chief markets are the Nainijor and Chapri b\u00e1z\u00e1srs on the Gogra, which, during the rainy season, are moved, the former to B\u00e1b\u00e1-ka-b\u00e1z\u00e1r, and the latter to Aus\u00e1npur, both on the south bank of the Little Sarju. Considering the nature of the tract, and the difficulties it presents, the tahs\u00edl is fairly supplied with communications. The Azamgarh-Gorakhpur and Gh\u00e1z\u00edpur-Gorakhpur first-class roads pass through the centre of the tahs\u00edl, meeting at Doharigh\u00e1t on the Gogra. The Azamgarh-Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d second-class road skirts the west of the tahs\u00edl, through Sagr\u00ed and Gop\u00e1lpur pargan\u00e1. There are numerous third-class roads which join the above, and connect the larger towns and villages.\n\nThe total area of Sagr\u00ed tahs\u00edl in 1881\u201382 was 592 square miles, of which 362 square miles were cultivated, 97 square miles cultivable, and 123 square miles uncultivable waste. Population (1881) 447,455, namely, males 226,037, and females 221,418; average density of population, 769 persons per square mile. Hindus number 395,737, and Muhammadans 51,718. Of the 1312 towns and villages in the tahs\u00edl, 1072 contain less than five hundred inhabitants; 162 between five hundred and a thousand; 63 between one and two thousand; and 14 between two and five thousand. The only place with upwards of five thousand inhabitants is D\u00fab\u00e1ri (7502). Of the total cultivated area, about 49 per cent. in Sagr\u00ed and Gop\u00e1lpur, and 38 per cent. in Ghos\u00ed and Nath\u00fapur, is cultivated by the proprietors as sir or homestead land. The tenant population is chiefly low caste, nearly all the high-caste landholders having retained their proprietary rights. In Sagr\u00ed and Gop\u00e1lpur the average area of holdings held by tenants with occupancy rights is $2\\frac{1}{2}$ acres, and of tenants-at-will $1\\frac{1}{2}$ acres. In Ghos\u00ed and Nath\u00fapur the average holdings are $3\\frac{1}{2}$ acres by tenants with occupancy rights, and less than 2 acres by tenants-at-will. Total Government land revenue (1881\u201382), \u00a342,293, or including local rates and cesses levied on the land, \u00a350,259. Amount of rental paid for cultivators, including rates and cesses, \u00a391,719. Sagr\u00ed tahs\u00edl contained in 1883, 1 criminal court, 7 police stations (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), a regular police force of 84 men, and a village watch or rural police of 694 chaukid\u00e1rs.\n\nS\u00e1h.\u2014Large village in Gh\u00e1z\u00edpur tahs\u00edl, Fatehpur District, North-Western Provinces; situated in lat. $25\u00b0 52' 55''$ N., and long. $80\u00b0 45' 46''$ E., 7 miles from Fatehpur town, and 5 miles from Gh\u00e1z\u00edpur.\nPopulation (1881) 3385, principally Ahirs. Old fort, said to have been built by a Bais Rajput; post-office, school, and bi-weekly market.\n\n**Sahar.**\u2014Town in Chhata tahsil, Muttra (Mathura) District, North-Western Provinces; situated in lat. $20^\\circ 37' 45''$ N., and long. $27^\\circ 37' 45''$ E., on the left bank of the Agra Canal, 7 miles south of Chhata town. Population (1881) 2776. Sahar was the seat of Thakur Badan Singh, the father of Suraj Mall, the first of the Bhartpur Rajas, who built for himself a handsome residence here, now to a great extent in ruins. The town contains several old houses with carved stone gateways, of some architectural pretensions. A number of handsomely carved pillars, the remains of an ancient temple, have been dug up, and are now in the Muttra Museum. A weekly market is held on Wednesdays, and the town contains a police station, post-office, and a good school. A small house-tax is raised for police and conservancy purposes.\n\n**Saharanpur.**\u2014District in the Lieutenant-Governorship of the North-Western Provinces, lying between $29^\\circ 34' 45''$ and $30^\\circ 21' 20''$ N. lat., and between $77^\\circ 9'$ and $78^\\circ 14' 45''$ E. long. Area, 2221 square miles. Population in 1881, 979,544 souls. Saharanpur is a District in the Meerut (Merath) Division. It is bounded on the north by the Siwalik Hills, which separate it from Dehra Dun District; on the east by the Ganges, separating it from Bijnaur District; on the south by Muzaffarnagar District; and on the west by the river Jumna (Jamuna), separating it from the Punjab Districts of Karnal and Ambala. The administrative head-quarters are at Saharanpur City.\n\n**Physical Aspects.**\u2014Saharanpur forms the most northerly portion of the Doab or alluvial table-land which stretches between the channels of the Ganges and the Jumna. The Siwalik Hills rise above it on the northern frontier. Their slopes are rugged and abrupt, pierced by numerous passes, and crowned by jagged summits which often assume the most fantastic shapes. At their base stretches a wild submontane tract, overgrown with forest or jungle, and intersected by innumerable mountain torrents, which leap foaming down from the hills on their way to join the waters of the Jumna and the Ganges. These two main arterial streams themselves descend into the plain through magnificent ravines, which rapidly give way to high banks of clay, as the rivers pass from the mountain region into the level table-land below.\n\nSouth of the intermediate forest belt lies the general plain of the Doab, an elevated upland tract, in whose friable soil the great rivers have cut themselves wide and shifting courses, at a depth of about 60 feet below the general surface. The broad valleys thus excavated are naturally well watered and fertile; but the great central plateau lies high and dry, with a general elevation of 900 feet above the sea, while\nnumberless small ravines drain off its scanty moisture towards the low land on either side.\n\nThe highest cultivation has, nevertheless, been rendered possible throughout the District by two splendid engineering achievements, the Ganges and the Eastern Jumna Canals (qq.v.), both of which take their origin within the boundaries of Saharanpur. The latter work was originally planned and in part executed by Al\u00ed Mardan Kh\u00e1n, the celebrated minister of Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n, but it was not finally completed till the year 1830. The difficulties attending the upper part seem to have been beyond the resources of Musalm\u00e1n engineering, and the canal is believed to have never flowed beyond one season until its reconstruction by the British under Sir P. Cautley, R.E. Colonel Colvin believes that 'the task of maintaining the passage across the mountain torrents at its head was found to be so great, that the canal was abandoned (by its native projectors) almost as soon as formed, and that the repeated attempts at reparation afterwards were only efficient for a season, and were overcome by the increasing difficulties.' The Eastern Jumna Canal, as it now exists, is entirely a work of British engineering. The Ganges Canal was opened in 1855. Both these canals run through the whole length of the District, from north to south, and have converted large portions of its central plateau into stretches of unbroken cultivation.\n\nThe District is everywhere thickly studded with flourishing villages and populous towns. The waste lands are small in amount, except in the hilly northern region; and cultivation is spreading on every side, under the fostering influence of peaceful government, and the successful issue of the irrigation schemes. The general aspect of the country is indicative of steady progress and comparative wealth, though the land is still capable of bearing a considerable increase of population without undue pressure on its resources.\n\nBesides the two great boundary rivers, Saharanpur is intersected by the Hindan, West K\u00e1li Nadi, and Sol\u00e1ni rivers, which, with a number of minor tributary streams and hill torrents, ultimately fall into the Ganges or Jumna. The surface of the country has a general slope from north to south, with a fall from 1489 above sea-level at the Trigonometrical Survey Station at Mohand, at the foot of the Siw\u00e1lik Hills, to 832 feet at Deoband in the south.\n\nThe mineral products are insignificant. In the middle and southern portions, kankar, or impure carbonate of lime, occurs in spongy nodules in the subsoil; limestone tufa, too, is occasionally found. To the north, the substratum consists of shingle and boulders, gradually giving place to sandstone, which at Mohand appears on the surface. Stone, hard enough to be used for building, is scarce. Pieces of sufficiently strong consistency for this purpose may be picked out of\nthe Siw\u00e1lik standstone. But although most of the houses at Hardw\u00e1r and Kankhal are constructed of materials so procured, the quantity obtained is not large enough to defray the expense of carriage to a long distance; and building stone is generally obtained from Agra.\n\nWild Animals.\u2014Tigers are still numerous in the forest belt along the foot of the Siw\u00e1lik Hills, and in the kh\u00e1dar of the Ganges. Leopards abound, and three varieties are distinguished in the District. Wild cats, lynxes, hy\u00e6nas, and wolves are common. During the rains wild elephants frequently descend from the Siw\u00e1l\u00edks to feed, and they often come as far as the Ganges valley, ten miles south of the hills, where they cause much destruction to the crops. Several varieties of deer, and the antelope and nilg\u00e1i, are also found. Poisonous serpents are not numerous; and the Siw\u00e1lik python, which grows to an immense size, appears to be harmless, and confines its depredations to the lower animals. The most valuable of the edible fish are the rohu, mah\u00e1sir, anw\u00e1ri, sol, and chilw\u00e1. Fish are tolerably abundant in the larger rivers, but measures are said to be needed to prevent their wholesale destruction near the canal heads.\n\nHistory.\u2014The portion of the Do\u00e1b in which Sah\u00e1ranpur is situated was probably one of the first regions of Upper India occupied by the Aryan colonists, as they spread eastward from their original settlement in the Punjab. But the legends of the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata centre around the city of Hast\u00ednapur, in the neighbouring District of Meerut; and it is not till the 14th century of our era that we learn any historical details with regard to Sah\u00e1ranpur itself. The town was founded in the reign of Mu\u1e25ammad Tughlak, about the year 1340, and derived its name from a Musalm\u00e1n saint, Sh\u00e1h Haran Chishti, whose shrine is still an object of attraction to Mu\u1e25ammadan devotees.\n\nAt the close of the century, the surrounding country was exposed to the ravages of Tim\u00far, who passed through Sah\u00e1ranpur on his return from the sack of Delhi, and subjected the Hindu inhabitants to all the usual horrors of a Mughal invasion. In the year 1414, the tract was conferred by Sult\u00e1n Sayyid Khizr Kh\u00e1n on Sayyid Sal\u00edm; and in 1526, B\u00e1bar marched across it on his way to P\u00e1nipat. A few Mughal colonies still trace their origin to his followers. A year later, the town of Gangoh was founded by the zealous missionary Abdul Kadd\u00fas, whose efforts were the means of converting to the faith of Isl\u00e1m many of his R\u00e1jput and G\u00fajar neighbours. His descendants ruled the District until the reign of Akbar, and were very influential in strengthening the Musalm\u00e1n element by their constant zeal in proselytizing.\n\nDuring the Augustan age of the Mughal Empire, Sah\u00e1ranpur was a favourite summer resort of the court and the nobles, who were attracted alike by the coolness of its climate and the facilities which it offered\nfor sport. The famous empress N\u00far Mah\u00e1l, the consort of Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr, had a palace in the village which still perpetuates her memory by its name of N\u00farnagar; and under Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n, the royal hunting seat of B\u00e1dsh\u00e1h Mah\u00e1l was erected by Al\u00ed Mardan Kh\u00e1n, the projector of the Eastern Jumna Canal. Unhappily, the canal was permitted to fall into disuse during the long and disastrous decline of the Mughal power, and it was never of much practical utility until the establishment of British rule.\n\nAfter the death of Aurangzeb, this region suffered, like the rest of Upper India, from the constant inroads of warlike tribes and the domestic feuds of its own princes. The first incursion of the Sikhs took place in 1709, under the weakened hold of Bah\u00e1dur Sh\u00e1h; and for eight successive years their wild hordes kept pouring ceaselessly into the Do\u00e1b, repulsed time after time, yet ever returning in greater numbers, to massacre the hated Muhammadans and turn their territory into a wilderness. The Sikhs did not even confine their barbarities to their Musalm\u00e1n foes, but murdered and pillaged the Hindu community with equal violence. In 1716, however, the Mughal court mustered strength enough to repel the invaders for a time; and it was not until the utter decay of all authority that the Sikhs once more appeared upon the scene.\n\nMeanwhile the Upper Do\u00e1b passed into the hands of the Sayyid brothers of B\u00e1rha, whose rule was more intimately connected with the neighbouring District of Muzaffarnagar. On their fall in 1721, their possessions were conferred upon various favourites in turn, until in 1754 they were granted by Ahmad Sh\u00e1h Dur\u00e1ni to Naj\u00edb Kh\u00e1n, a Rohill\u00e1 leader, as a reward for his services at the battle of Kotila. This energetic ruler made the best of his advantages, and before his death (1770) had extended his dominions to the north of the Siw\u00e1l\u00edks on one side, and as far south as Meerut on the other. But the end of his rule was disturbed by incursions of the two great aggressive races from opposite quarters, the Sikhs and the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. Naj\u00edb Kh\u00e1n handed down his authority to his son, Z\u00e1bita Kh\u00e1n, who at first revolted from the feeble court of Delhi; but on being conquered by Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 aid, was glad to receive back his fief through the kind offices of his former enemies, then supreme in the councils of the Empire. During the remainder of his life, Z\u00e1bita Kh\u00e1n was continually engaged in repelling the attacks of the Sikhs, who could never forgive him for his reconciliation with the imperial party. Under his son, Ghul\u00e1m K\u00e1dir (1785), the District enjoyed comparative tranquillity. The Sikhs were firmly held in check, and a strong government was established over the native chieftains.\n\nBut upon the death of its last Rohill\u00e1 prince, who was mutilated and killed by Sindhia in 1788, the country fell into the hands of the\nMar\u00e1th\u00e1s, and remained in their possession until the British conquest. Their rule was very precarious, owing to the perpetual raids made by the Sikhs; and they were at one time compelled to call in the aid of George Thomas, the daring military adventurer who afterwards established an independent government in Hari\u00e1na. Indeed, the internal quarrels of this confused period are too complicated for brief narration; and it must suffice to say that the country remained practically in the hands of the Sikhs, who levied black-mail under the pretence of collecting revenue.\n\nAfter the fall of Al\u00edgarh and the capture of Delhi (1803), a British force was despatched to reduce Sah\u00e1ranpur. Here, for a time, a double warfare was kept up against the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s on one side and the Sikhs on the other. The latter were defeated in the indecisive battle of Char\u00e1on (24th November 1804), but still continued their irregular raids for some years. Organization, however, was quietly pushed forward; and the District enjoyed a short season of comparative tranquillity, until the death of the largest landowner, R\u00e1m D\u00e1yal Singh, in 1813. The resumption of his immense estates gave rise to a G\u00fajar revolt, which was put down before it had assumed very serious dimensions. A more dangerous disturbance took place in 1824; a confederacy on a large scale was planned among the native chiefs, and a rising of the whole Do\u00e1b might have occurred had not the premature eagerness of the rebels disclosed their design. As it was, the revolt was only suppressed by a sanguinary battle, which ended in the total defeat of the insurgents and the fall of their ringleaders.\n\nFrom that period till the Mutiny, no events of importance disturbed the quiet course of civil administration in Sah\u00e1ranpur. News of the rising at Meerut was received early in May 1857, and the European women and children were immediately despatched to the hills. Measures were taken for the defence of the city, and a garrison of European civil servants established themselves in the Magistrate\u2019s house. The District soon broke out into irregular rebellion; but the turbulent spirit showed itself rather in the form of internecine quarrels amongst the native leaders than of any settled opposition to British government. Old feuds sprang up anew; villages returned to their ancient enmities; bankers were robbed, and money-lenders pillaged; yet the local officers continued to exercise many of their functions, and to punish the chief offenders by ordinary legal process. On the 2nd of June, a portion of the Native infantry at Sah\u00e1ranpur mutinied and fired upon their officers, but without effect. Shortly afterwards, a small body of G\u00farkhas arrived, by whose assistance order was partially restored. As early as December 1857, it was found practicable to proceed with the regular assessment of the District, and the population appeared to be civil and respectful. In fact, the mutiny in Sah\u00e1ranpur was merely\nan outbreak of the old predatory anarchy, which had not yet been extirpated by our industrial r\u00e9gime, and there was little indication of any popular aversion to British rule.\n\n**Population.**\u2014The earliest Census, which gives the population of the District with its present area, was that of 1853; the number of inhabitants then amounted to 801,325. By 1865 the population had increased to 869,176, or 389 to the square mile. In 1872 the enumeration disclosed a further increase to 884,017 persons. The last Census in 1881 returned the total population at 979,544, showing an increase of 178,219, or 22.1 per cent., in the 28 years since 1853. The increase since 1872 was 95,527, or 10.8 per cent. in 9 years.\n\nThe results of the Census of 1881 may be summarized as follows:\u2014Area, 2221.4 square miles; towns 10, and villages 1595; number of houses, 91,977. Total population, 979,544, namely, males 530,427, and females 449,117; proportion of males, 54.1 per cent. Average density of population, 441 persons per square mile; number of towns and villages, .72 per square mile; persons per town or village, 610; houses per square mile, 41.4; inmates per house, 10.6, a larger number than in any other District of the Province. Classified according to sex and age, there were in 1881\u2014under 15 years of age, boys 197,979, and girls 165,806; total children, 363,785, or 37.1 per cent. of the District population: 15 years and upwards, males 332,448, and females 283,311; total adults, 615,759, or 62.9 per cent. The preponderance of males is chiefly due to the former prevalence of infanticide, a practice which all the vigilance of the Government has not yet been able entirely to check. In 1881, out of a total of 122,464 of the suspected castes (R\u00e1jputs, G\u00fajars, T\u00e1g\u00e1s, J\u00e1ts, Ah\u00edrs, and Ah\u00e1rs), the females numbered only 48,752, or 39.8 per cent.\n\n**Religion.**\u2014As regards the religious classification in 1881, Hindus are returned at 653,272, or 66.7 per cent.; Muhammadans, 317,535, or 32.3 per cent.; Jains, 6673; Christians, 1793; Sikhs, 269; and P\u00e1rs\u00eds, 2. Of the higher Hindu castes, Br\u00e1hmans numbered 47,288. R\u00e1jputs numbered 28,798, of whom only 11,540, or 40 per cent., were females. They are one of the castes suspected of infanticide, and in many villages the provisions of the Infanticide Act are strictly enforced. In physique, the R\u00e1jputs are a fine hardy race, but their lawless spirit has given much trouble. The Baniy\u00e1s or trading castes were returned at 32,622, amongst whom the Agarw\u00e1las form by far the largest sub-division. Bh\u00e1ts numbered 2067, and K\u00e1yasths 1587. The other or S\u00fadra Hindu castes numbered 540,910, comprising the great mass of the population. The most numerous of them were the Cham\u00e1rs, reckoned at 174,956. Next in number come the G\u00fajars, a race of supposed Tartar origin, almost peculiar to the northern Do\u00e1b, who are returned at 57,376. They are\na turbulent race, addicted to cattle-lifting, and are also among the clans suspected of female infanticide, the proportion of females among them being under 40 per cent. Kah\u00e1rs number 42,915; Kachh\u00eds, 28,807; Bhang\u00eds, 28,740; M\u00e1l\u00eds, 25,108; T\u00e1g\u00e1s, 16,345; Kumbh\u00e1rs, 15,511; Barh\u00e1is, 13,450; J\u00e1ts, 13,998; Gad\u00e1ri\u00e1s, 10,837; Loh\u00e1rs, 8549; N\u00e1is, 8516; Koris, 6647; Ah\u00edrs, 5904; Son\u00e1rs, 5449; Dhob\u00eds, 4078; and Lodhs, 2982.\n\nThe Musalm\u00e1ns are partly descendants of the various early invaders, partly native converts from Hinduism. Amongst the former, the Sayyids, Mughals, and Path\u00e1ns are the most numerous. Those of Hindu origin still retain many of their old practices and prejudices, while their trade classes are assuming the rigid character of castes. The religious opinions of the people have been much shaken by the influences of civilisation, but Christianity has made little progress amongst them, nor does the faith of Isl\u00e1m now gain many converts. There were in 1881, 28,070 Muhammadans returned in the District as of respectable Hindu descent, namely, R\u00e1jputs, 12,843; G\u00fajars, 14,207; T\u00e1g\u00e1s, 893; J\u00e1ts, 90; and Mew\u00e1t\u00eds, 37. By sect the Muhammadans of Sah\u00e1ranpur consist of Sunnis, 314,855; and Shi\u00e1s, 2680.\n\nThe Christian population comprises\u2014Europeans, 1291; Eurasians, 166; and natives of India, 336. The American Presbyterian body has a missionary station at Sah\u00e1ranpur, established in 1836; and another at R\u00fark\u00ed, established in 1856.\n\nTown and Rural Population.\u2014Sah\u00e1ranpur contains a considerable urban population. In 1881, ten towns were returned as containing upwards of five thousand inhabitants, namely, Sah\u00e1ranpur, 51,194; Deoband, 22,116; R\u00fark\u00ed, 15,953; Jawalapur, 15,196; Gangoh, 12,089; Manglaur, 9990; Rampur, 7951; Ambehta, 6392; Kankhal, 5838; and Landhaura, 5764. These ten towns contain an aggregate of 160,483 inhabitants, or 16\u00b77 per cent. of the total population of the District. The four municipal towns of Sah\u00e1ranpur, Hardwar Union, Deoband, and R\u00fark\u00ed contain an aggregate population of 122,234. Municipal income (1883\u201384), \u00a39553, of which \u00a37588 was derived from taxation; average incidence of taxation, 1s. 1\u00bdd. per head. The 1605 towns and villages are thus classified according to size\u2014467 are mere hamlets with less than two hundred inhabitants; 558 contain between two hundred and five hundred; 385 between five hundred and a thousand; 146 between one and two thousand; 24 between two and three thousand; 15 between three and five thousand; 5 between five and ten thousand; 3 between ten and twenty thousand; and 2 upwards of twenty thousand inhabitants.\n\nAs regards occupation, the Census divides the male population into the following six classes:\u2014(1) Professional, military, and official class,\n16,502; (2) domestic class, including inn and lodging-house keepers, 3999; (3) commercial class, including bankers, merchants, traders, carriers, etc., 13,624; (4) agricultural and pastoral class, including gardeners, 180,709; (5) manufacturing and industrial class, including artisans, 94,838; and (6) indefinite, non-productive, and unspecified class, comprising general labourers and male children, 220,755.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014In 1883\u201384, out of a total area of 1832\u00bd square miles, or 1,172,692 acres, assessed for Government revenue, 848,924 acres, or 72\u00b74 per cent., were under cultivation, of which 97,314 acres were irrigated from Government canals, and 54,607 acres from wells and tanks, while 697,003 acres were unirrigated. Of the uncultivated area, 186,907 acres were returned as grazing lands or available for cultivation, while 136,861 acres were uncultivable waste. The rabi or spring harvest is sown in October, and reaped in March; and the kharif or rain harvest is sown in June, and gathered in October. The chief spring products are wheat and barley (415,949 acres in 1883\u201384), pulses (65,858 acres), sugar-cane (40,062 acres), and oil-seeds (2792 acres). The staples of the rain harvest are rice (96,929 acres), jo\u00e1r and b\u00e1jra (81,974 acres), and vegetables. The cultivation of cotton was carried on very largely during the prevalence of high prices caused by the American war; but in 1883, the area under cotton had shrunk to 47,352 acres. Indigo, on the contrary, has been grown in greater quantities since the introduction of canal irrigation has rendered its out-turn less precarious than formerly. Cereals are, however, the principal products of the total cultivated area. A Government botanical garden was established in the town of Saharanpur in 1817, and has proved eminently successful, both from a scientific point of view, and in the practical work of naturalizing useful plants, trees, and fruits.\n\nThe condition of the peasantry is comfortable; but many of the Musalm\u00e1n proprietors, in their disdain of personal toil, have carried sub-division of shares to such an excess that they have sunk into a position more impecunious than that of the labouring class. Until lately, the non-proprietary cultivators held their lands by customary tenure, at low fixed rates, which were not liable to enhancement; but the zamind\u00e1rs have now begun to exercise their legal right of raising the rent, and the labourers are fast losing their customary privileges. Many estates have been transferred to new proprietors since the Mutiny; and, unfortunately, in a large number of cases they have fallen into the hands of money-lenders, who are usually absentee, and make very indifferent landlords.\n\nThe landed estates of Saharanpur District are all held under zam\u00edn-d\u00e1ri, pattid\u00e1ri, or bh\u00e1yach\u00e1ra tenures. Zamind\u00e1ri tenures are those in which the whole land is held and managed in common, and the\nrents and profits of the estate are thrown into one common stock and divided among the several proprietors, whose rights are estimated according to fractional shares. Perfect pattidari is that tenure wherein the whole lands are held in severalty by the different proprietors, all of whom are jointly responsible for the Government revenue, though each is theoretically responsible only for the quota represented by the proportion of the land he holds. Bhuyach\u00e1ra or imperfect pattidari is where portions of the land are held in severalty, and portions in common, with a joint responsibility for the Government demand. In this case, the revenue is primarily made up from the rents of the common lands, and the remainder by a cess proportioned to the holdings in severalty, and calculated either by custom or on a fixed scale.\n\nOf the total male adult agricultural population (176,194) of Saharanpur, 51,651 are returned as landholders, 901 as estate servants, 79,929 as cultivators, and 43,713 as agricultural labourers. Average area cultivated by each male adult agriculturist, 4.68 acres. The total population, however, dependent on the soil numbers 477,847, or 48.78 per cent. of the District population. The total Government land revenue assessment, including local rates and cesses levied on the land, amounted in 1881 to \u00a3139,100, or an average of 3s. 5\u00bed. per cultivated acre. Rental paid by cultivators, \u00a3197,524, or an average of 4s. 9\u00bed. per cultivated acre. Rents are still to a great extent paid in kind, and in 1882 only 57 per cent. of the tenants paid in cash. The best lands rent at from 10s. 6d. to 12s. an acre, and the poorest from 3s. 9d. to 4s. 6d.; average rates, from 7s. 6d. to 9s. Wages have risen about 60 per cent. during the past ten years, owing to the large demand for labour on the canals and railways and at the R\u00fark\u00ed workshops. In 1884, bricklayers and carpenters received from 7\u00bdd. to 9d. per diem; blacksmiths, 7\u00bdd.; common labourers, 3d. The ordinary prices of food-grains in 1884 were as follows:\u2014Wheat, 20 sers the rupee, or 5s. 7d. per cwt.; barley, 24\u00be sers the rupee, or 4s. 6\u00bcd. per cwt.; jo\u00e1r, 27 sers the rupee, or 4s. 2d. per cwt.; gram, 27 sers the rupee, or 4s. 2d. per cwt.; best rice, 8\u00bd sers the rupee, or 13s. 3d. per cwt.; and common rice, 11\u00be sers the rupee, or 9s. 6d. per cwt.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014The capricious rainfall in the mountain tract to the north often causes sudden floods on the Ganges and the Jumna, yet inundations of importance seldom occur. Villages, however, are sometimes transferred from one bank to the other by shifting of the channel, as many as 330 being liable to fluvial action in some one or other of its forms. Drought visits the District with great severity; famines due to this cause having occurred in 1837, in 1860, and in 1868\u201369. On the last occasion, almost all the autumn crops were lost, except in the irrigated region, the area of which exceptionally in-\nincreased by 40,995 acres. In July and August 1869, the price of jo\u00e1r and b\u00e1jra rose as high as 8 sers the rupee, or 14s. per cwt. Relief measures were undertaken early in that year, and for 77 days an average of 2948 persons were employed upon famine works, while 161 persons received gratuitous aid at poorhouses. These figures show that the distress was not nearly so severe as in neighbouring Districts. The opening of the Sind Punjab and Delhi Railway, during the scarcity, contributed to allay the danger of starvation. The spread of irrigation has done much to secure Sah\u00e1ranpur from the extremity of famine in future years; while, as regards communications, it compares favourably with any District in the North-Western Provinces.\n\nCommerce and Trade, etc.\u2014The commerce of Sah\u00e1ranpur is chiefly confined to its raw materials, and especially to food-grains, in which it possesses a thriving and increasing trade. Its manufactures consist of coarse cloth, jewellery, sweetmeats, wood-carving, and leather-working. There are several cotton-pressing mills. The R\u00fark\u00ed workshops, recently transferred by the Government to a private company, employ over 1000 workmen. Among the articles produced are steam-engines, pumps, printing presses, lathes, and mathematical instruments. Besides its direct value as a source of income, this establishment is of great importance as a training school for native artisans. The Thomason Civil Engineering College, also situated at R\u00fark\u00ed, is a most useful institution; in 1871, no fewer than 112 students qualified for the public service. A large horse fair is held here every year, in connection with which an agricultural exhibition was established in 1881. A large annual horse fair is also held at Hardw\u00e1r. The District is well supplied with means of communication. The Grand Trunk line of the Delhi and Punjab Railway runs for a distance of 42 miles within its boundaries, with stations at Deoband, Sah\u00e1ranpur, and Sars\u00e1wa. A branch of the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway now also forms a junction with the Punjab line at Sah\u00e1ranpur. There are also several excellent metalled roads, one of which leads by a tunnelled passage to Dehra. Total length of roads in 1883\u201384, 417 miles. Much traffic passes by the Ganges Canal. The Thomason College contains an English printing press, and there are three native presses in the District.\n\nAdministration.\u2014In 1866, the land revenue amounted to \u00a333,522; by 1850, it had risen to \u00a3105,844; and in 1883, it reached the sum of \u00a3118,066. The increase is due in great part to the benefits derived from canal irrigation. The other principal items of revenue in 1883\u201384 were\u2014Stamps, \u00a317,432; excise, \u00a311,876; provincial rates, \u00a314,568; assessed taxes, \u00a34071; and registration, \u00a31552. The District is under the civil jurisdiction of the munsifs of Sah\u00e1ranpur and Deoband, from both of whom appeals lie to the Judge of Sah\u00e1ran-\npur. In 1883, there were 14 civil and revenue and 20 magisterial courts open. The regular and town police in 1883 numbered 861 officers and men, or 1 policeman to every 2.57 square miles and every 1135 inhabitants. The cost was \u00a38043, of which \u00a35539 was defrayed from provincial revenue. The regular force was supplemented by 1727 village watchmen (chaukidars), or 1 to every 567 inhabitants. In the same year, 1046 persons were convicted for all offences, being 1 person in every 936 of the population. Saharanpur contains 1 District and 2 subsidiary jails, the average daily number of prisoners in which was 312 in 1883, of whom 6 were females.\n\nEducation has been spreading slowly of late years. In 1860 there were 399 schools, with 5639 pupils, taught at a cost of \u00a31559. In 1871 the number of schools had fallen to 381; but these had a total roll of 7934 children, while the sum expended on education had risen to \u00a33674. In 1883\u201384 there were altogether 166 schools under inspection by the Education Department, attended by 5133 pupils. This is exclusive of private and uninspected schools, for which no materials exist. But the Census Report of 1881 returned 8176 boys and 252 girls as under instruction, besides 24,928 males and 524 females able to read and write, but not under instruction. There is an excellent school in connection with the American Presbyterian Mission, and the towns of Deoband and Saharanpur are noted for their superior Arabic and Persian schools. The District is divided into 4 tahsils and 15 parganas, which contained 2066 estates in 1883\u201384, each paying an average Government revenue of \u00a357 per annum.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate of Saharanpur is the same as that of the Doab generally, modified by its northern position and the cool breezes from the neighbouring hill country. The cold weather arrives earlier and lasts longer than in the lower Districts, but the summer months are tropical in their excessive heat. The mean monthly temperature at Rurki in the north of the District, near the Siwalik Hills, for a period of 19 years ending 1881 was as follows:\u2014January, 56.3\u00b0 F.; February, 60.8\u00b0 F.; March, 70.2\u00b0 F.; April, 81.5\u00b0 F.; May, 87.6\u00b0 F.; June, 90.5\u00b0 F.; July, 84.9\u00b0 F.; August, 83.8\u00b0 F.; September, 82.7\u00b0 F.; October, 75.1\u00b0 F.; November, 64.3\u00b0 F.; December, 57.0\u00b0 F.: average for the year, 74.6\u00b0. The average rainfall at Saharanpur town for a period of about 35 years is returned as follows:\u2014January, 1.32 inch; February, 1.49 inch; March, 1.19 inch; April, 0.42 inch; May, 0.78 inch; June, 4.46 inches; July, 12.45 inches; August, 9.46 inches; September, 3.87 inches; October, 0.47 inch; November, 0.17 inch; December, 0.50 inch: total, 36.58 inches. Rurki, from its nearer proximity to the hills, has a rainfall averaging about 5 inches heavier than that of Saharanpur town. Fever and small-pox are the principal\ndiseases of the District. The total number of deaths registered in 1883-84 was 29,946, or at the rate of 29\u00b762 per thousand, as against an average of 38\u00b703 per thousand for the previous five years. Seven dispensaries in 1883-84 afforded medical relief to 981 in-door and 54,710 out-door patients.

Area, 618 square miles, of which 441 square miles are assessed for Government revenue, and 353 square miles are cultivated. Population (1872) 253,606; (1881) 292,293, namely, males 155,318, and females 136,975. Increase between 1872 and 1881, 38,687, or 15\u00b72 per cent. in nine years. Classified according to religion, there were in 1881\u2014Hindus, 176,269; Muhammadans, 113,563; Jains, 1829; and \u2018others,\u2019 632. Of the 472 towns and villages in the pargan\u00e1, 300 contain less than five hundred inhabitants; 128 between five hundred and a thousand; and 43 between one and five thousand. The only place with upwards of five thousand inhabitants is Sah\u00e1ranpur town (59,194). Government land revenue, \u00a333,315, or including local rates and cesses levied on land, \u00a337,418. Rental paid by cultivators, including rates and cesses, \u00a367,244. In 1883, Sah\u00e1ranpur tahsil contained (including head-quarter courts) 3 civil and 10 criminal courts, 5 police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), a regular police force of 203 men, and a rural police or village watch of 459 chaukid\u00e1rs.\n\nSah\u00e1ranpur.\u2014City, municipality, and administrative head-quarters of Sah\u00e1ranpur District, North-Western Provinces; situated in lat. 29\u00b0 58' 15\" N., and long. 77\u00b0 35' 15\" E., on a low site on both sides of the Damaula Nad\u00ed. Population (1872) 43,844; (1881) 59,194, namely, males 31,506, and females 27,688. The Muhammadans, although they form only 32\u00b73 per cent. of the District population, predominate largely in Sah\u00e1ranpur town, where they number 32,449, or 3\u00b73 per cent. of the total District population. Hindus number 24,854; Jains, 1277; Christians, 562; and \u2018others,\u2019 52. Municipal income (1883-84), \u00a34299, of which \u00a33786 was derived from taxation, mainly octroi.\n\nThe city lies in a low and moist situation, and until recent\ndrainage reclamations were effected, was exposed to the malarious influences from an unwholesome marsh on the west. About one-half the houses are built of brick or masonry, and the number of substantially built dwellings and shops is annually increasing. The principal market-place is a scene of busy trade. The station of the Sind Punjab and Delhi Railway, opened to Sah\u00e1ranpur in 1869, is the place of departure from the railway for travellers to the hill sanitarium of Mussoorie (Mas\u00fari). A branch of the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway from Morad\u00e1b\u00e1d to Sah\u00e1ranpur was opened throughout early in 1886. Besides the District head-quarters courts and offices, the principal official buildings consist of the tahs\u00edl, an old Rohill\u00e1 fort now used as an office, police station, post-office, dispensary, telegraph office, and jail. St. Thomas' Church was consecrated in 1858. Two or three hotels and a travellers' bungalow are situated near the railway station. A handsome new mosque, on the plan of the Jam\u00e1 Masjid at Delhi, has been erected within the last few years by the Muhammadan community, who, besides being the most numerous, form the most influential body. Sah\u00e1ranpur is the head-quarters of the Jumna Canal Establishment, the site of a mission of the American Presbyterian Church, and a station of the Great Trigonometrical Survey. The trade of the town, which is considerable, consists chiefly in grain, sugar, molasses, and country cloth. The Government botanical gardens, established in 1817, cover an area 3000 feet long by 2000 feet broad, and are laid out with many fine walks and carriage drives. A large horse fair and an agricultural exhibition, steadily increasing in importance, is held every spring. Sah\u00e1ranpur was long notorious for malarious diseases, but the drainage operations and other sanitary works have effected a very marked improvement in this respect.\n\n**Sah\u00e1spur** *(Sahispur).*\u2014Town in Dhampur tahs\u00edl, Bijnaur (Bijnor) District, North-Western Provinces; situated in lat. 29\u00b0 7\u2032 40\u2033 N., and long. 78\u00b0 40\u2032 15\u2033 E., on the Morad\u00e1b\u00e1d and Hardw\u00e1r road, 28 miles south-east of Bijnaur town. Population (1881) 6338, namely, Muhammadans 5134, and Hindus 1204. Bi-weekly market. A speciality of the town is the weaving of a superior quality of cotton cloth, in pieces 5 yards long by 1 yard wide, which sell for 10s. Station on the northern extension of the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway.\n\n**Sah\u00e1sw\u00e1n.**\u2014Tahsil and town in Bud\u00e1un District, North-Western Provinces.\u2014See SAHISWAN.\n\n**Sahatw\u00e1r.**\u2014Town in B\u00e1nsdih tahs\u00edl, Ballia District, North-Western Provinces.\u2014See MAHATWAR.\n\n**Sah\u00e1war.**\u2014Town in K\u00e1sganj tahs\u00edl, Etah District, North-Western Provinces, 24 miles north-east of Etah town. Population (1881) 4065, namely, 1793 Hindus and 2272 Muhammadans. Police station, school, post-office. Founded by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Naurang Deb, a Chauh\u00e1n.\nR\u00e1jput, who called it Naurang\u00e1b\u00e1d after his own name. On being attacked by the Musalm\u00e1ns, the R\u00e1j\u00e1 fled to Sirhpura, and the inhabitants who remained were forcibly converted to Isl\u00e1m. Shortly afterwards, Naurang, assisted by the R\u00e1j\u00e1 and the people of Sirhpura, expelled the Musalm\u00e1ns, and changed the name of the town to Sah\u00e1war. The place is now far from flourishing; small local b\u00e1z\u00e1r, bad communications. Tomb of Faiz-ud-d\u00edn, a fakir, forms the only object of interest. Police station, post-office, and village school. A small house-tax is raised for police and conservancy purposes.\n\n**Sahet Mahet** (or Sr\u00e1vasti).\u2014A vast collection of ruins in Gonda District, Oudh; situated in lat. $27\u00b0\\ 31'N.$, and long. $82\u00b0\\ 5'E.$, on the south bank of the R\u00e1pti river, 10 miles from Balr\u00e1mpur, and 6 from Ikauna. These ruins have been identified by General Cunningham as the remains of the ancient city of Sr\u00e1vasti, whose site had been conjecturally fixed by Lassen within a few miles of the spot, but on the opposite bank of the river. The following account has been prepared by Mr. W. Hoey for the present edition of *The Imperial Gazetteer*.\n\nThe name Sr\u00e1vasti is said to have been given to the city by an eponymous founder, a mythical king Sr\u00e1vasta of the Solar race. A connection has been suggested between the name of the city and that of the river, but without good grounds. We have the Sanskrit names Sr\u00e1vasti for the city and Airavati for the river, standing side by side with the Pali names Sawatthi and Aciravati respectively. The latter appears softened in the form Ahiravati which the R\u00e1pti bears in its course through the hills. The same name appears as Irawadi in Burma. Airavati was the name of Indra's female elephant.\n\nNothing is known of Sr\u00e1vasti till the time of Buddha, when it appears as an important city, the capital of Uttara Kosala. The king was then Parasen\u00e1ditya, son of Aranemi Brahmadatta. This king had a son named Jeta by his Kshattriya wife Varshika; but he married a second time a Br\u00e1hman slave girl, Mallika, of Kapilavastu, by whom he had a son, Virudh\u00e1ka, who succeeded him. It is probable that she also bore him another son, Seger Sandalitu, who eventually became king in Tibet. Parasen\u00e1ditya's treasurer was Sudatta, surnamed Anathapindika because of his charitable care for fatherless children. He, during a visit to R\u00e1j\u00e1griha, met Buddha and was converted to the new faith, returned to Sr\u00e1vasti, purchased a garden from prince Jeta, prepared to build a vih\u00e1ra for the master's reception, procured the deputation of Sariputta to superintend the erection, completed it, and finally induced Buddha to come and receive the gift for the Order. Jeta had meanwhile declared for the new creed and added to the building, so that when Buddha came he named the monastery Jetavana An\u00e1thapind-K\u00e1r\u00e1ma, 'Jeta's garden Sudatta's pleasure ground.' The coupling of the two names has continued to this day in all Buddhist writings.\nSudatta is known in the Pali books as 'Mahasetthi,' the great treasurer (setthi) par excellence. Now, if we insert this name, we read, 'Jetavana Mahasetthi-\u00e1rama,' or, dropping the superfluous words, as we drop 'church' or 'chapel' when speaking of St. Paul's, St. Margaret's, and so on, we have the place named Jeta Mahasetthi. It is not hard to see how this eventually shortened into Set Mahet. This was the ancient name, and people still speak of the ruins of the Jetavana as Set. It was this name which was recorded in the settlement maps after annexation, and it is so written in the village records.\n\nThe Jetavana was one of the most famous, as well as one of the most sacred, places in Buddhist eyes, because Buddha here spent many of the periods of retreat in his long career. The two chief tenements within the garden enclosure were the Gaudhakuti and the Kosamba Kuti, both of which seem to have been identified by General Cunningham with propriety. Recent excavations have exposed many other undoubtedly ancient buildings, and show that there is a large field which would amply repay research. Near the place where probably stood the eastern gate, there has been opened a stupa which contained the begging pot and alms-bowl, and also the ashes of a monk. The last were found in a porcelain bowl enclosed in a casket. These seem to be the ashes of Sariputta, the great apostle and the architect of the Jetavana. We learn from Tibetan sources that he died at Nalanda in Lower Bengal. He was cremated. The disciples brought his ashes, pot, and bowl to Buddha, who carried them to Sravasti, and gave them to Sudatta, whom he instructed to build a stupa over them.\n\nBuddha found many teachers of rival faiths and philosophies already established at Sravasti. Their names and something of their tenets are known, but the most important was Nirgrantha Ju\u00e1taputta, the Mahavira of the Jains. It is not exactly clear that he ever met the last named in the course of controversy, but he met the others and worsted them. One of the distinguished teachers, Purna Katyapa, committed suicide. Jainism lingered on in Sravasti after Buddhism had vanished; and, as the Jains allege that their third patriarch Sobhn\u00e1th or Somn\u00e1th was born here, and they have a clinging veneration for a mound called after him, they still make pilgrimages occasionally to the spot. During recent excavations, this mound was opened, the walls of certain old buildings exposed, and many images were found. Other Jain temples were found not far off. All these Jain remains are within the city. The famous Jetavana lies wholly without the city; and it is not unlikely that it was the existence of other faiths already dominating the popular mind which placed Sudatta under the necessity of buying a garden outside the city for which he had to pay gold coins sufficient to cover the area he needed. It is clear that Sravasti was not only the capital of a kingdom, but the centre of free thought and philosophic speculation.\nIt was at Sr\u00e1vasti that Visakha M\u00e1twi, the standing type of the noble Buddhist matron, lived. She built a vih\u00e1ra for Buddha here. It was also here that Devadatta died during an attempt he made on the master's life; and here two remarkable attempts were made to blast Buddha's reputation by charges of incontinency. And it was also here that he made his most remarkable conversion, that of Angulim\u00e1la.\n\nAny one reading the Buddhist scriptures cannot fail to be struck with the number of discourses, rulings, and precepts delivered at Sr\u00e1vasti, nearly all at the Jetavana. The Jatakas, or birth-stories, told by Buddha are in all 498, and of these 416 were told at Sr\u00e1vasti, and of these 416 not less than 410 in the Jetavana.\n\nParasen\u00e1dyita was a staunch friend of Buddha; but his son Virudh\u00e1ka usurped the throne, and combined with Ambharisha, the prime minister's son, to persecute the Buddhists. To this they were led by a desire to gratify private resentment against the Sakyas of Kapilavastu. Virudh\u00e1ka marched out with an army to wreak his wrath, but Buddha succeeded in inducing him to retreat. A second time he went unopposed to the Sakya town, effected an entry by fraud, massacred the people, and brought away 500 youths and 500 virgins. He slew the former and tried to force the latter to enter his harem, but they would not: so them too he slew near the walls of Sr\u00e1vasti.\n\nBuddha now foretold that within a week Virudh\u00e1ka and Ambharisha would be burned up. Virudh\u00e1ka signalized his return to Sr\u00e1vasti by murdering Jeta. He then built himself a pleasure house in the waters of a tank and stayed there with Ambharisha and his women, for as he thought long enough. On the last day the women had left, and the king and his companion were about to leave, when the rays of the sun, acting through a magnifying glass, which was lying on a cushion, set fire to it and to the pavilion. In the conflagration the king and his evil adviser perished. Thus closed this line of sovereigns.\n\nIn the second century B.C., the Buddhist patriarch Rahulata died at Sr\u00e1vasti, and the Jetavana is said to have supplied a sect of doctors to the Fourth Buddhist Synod; but we know nothing of the history of the city until Fa-Hian visited it in 410 A.D. It is true that between 275 and 319 A.D. a king of Sr\u00e1vasti is mentioned named Khiradhar, and his nephew is said to have succeeded him, but they cannot have had any power. Fa-Hian found about 200 families living in the city. Huen Tsiang, who visited the place in the beginning of the seventh century, found it completely reduced to ruin, and only a few monks lingering at the deserted monasteries.\n\nFrom this period all knowledge ceases. Local tradition connects Suhar Deo, who successfully opposed S\u00e1l\u00e1r Mas\u00e1\u00fad at Bahr\u00e1\u00edch, with Sahet Mahet; but tradition is here very lame. The Saulat-i-Mas\u00e1\u00fadi, which gives the only account we have of this campaign, clearly describes\nSuhar Deo as belonging to Siujh\u00e1uli, and the same book mentions Rai Saet as a separate individual. Besides this, a stone bearing a long Sanskrit inscription, which was discovered in the course of recent excavations, gives a line of nine kings ending with Suhirdah (of which Suhar Deo is clearly a corruption); and their capital, though not yet clearly read, is certainly not Sahet Mahet, but will probably be found to be Guw\u00e1r\u00edch.\n\nThe following more ornate account is quoted from Mr. W. C. Benett, C.S., in the Oudh Gazetteer, pp. 281-286. It is not necessary to agree with all Mr. Benett's dates and statements, in order to appreciate his work. See also General Cunningham's Geography of Ancient India, pp. 407-414 (ed. 1871).\n\n'The foundation of the city is attributed to Sr\u00e1vasta, an old king of the Solar race, the ninth in descent from Manu, at a time beside which the most ancient myths are comparatively modern. From him was derived the name Sr\u00e1vasti, which appears in the Pr\u00e1krit forms S\u00e1wattha, S\u00e1wanta, and Shr\u00e1vanta, and has since been corrupted into Sahet. Though the words do not at first look alike, it is probable that the names of the river and the town, Sahet Mahet and R\u00e1pti, were once the same, viz. Shar\u00e1vati, and derived from Savitri, the sun-god. At the mythical era of the R\u00e1m\u00e1yana, Sr\u00e1vasti was the capital of Uttar Kus\u00e1la, the northern province of R\u00e1ma's empire, which, on the division of the kingdom at the death of that hero, fell to the share of his son Lava. At the commencement of the historical age, in the 6th century before Christ, we find it still one of the six principal kingdoms of Madhyadesha or Central Hindust\u00e1n. It was then bounded on the south by Saketa, or Ajodhya, and on the east by Vaishali, the modern Behar and Benares; so it probably contained at least the present Districts of Bahrach, Gonda, Basti, and Gorakhpur. The king, Paras\u00e9n\u00e1ditya, who is given in the Vishnu Pur\u00e1na as great-grandson of Buddha, and who was very probably connected in race with the princely prophet, was an early convert to the new faith, and invited its founder to the Kalandaka Vih\u00e1ra in the Venuvana at Sr\u00e1vasti. Here, or in Ajodhya, Buddha spent the greater number of the rainy seasons, during which he used to rest from his missionary labours; nor did he finally leave the place till he started on that journey to Bengal which ended in his attainment of nirv\u00e1na. During his lifetime, Sudatta, the prime minister, built the Jetavana, a magnificent monastery, whose ruins lie to the south-west of the capital. On the death of Paras\u00e9n\u00e1ditya, his son Virudh\u00e1ka succeeded, and showed himself a bitter enemy to the faith; he crowned many acts of oppression by including 500 Buddhist virgins in his harem. For this it was predicted that on the seventh day he should be consumed by fire. To falsify the prophecy, he and his court spent the day in boats on the pond to the south of the city; but\nthe waters fled back, the earth yawned, and the guilty monarch disappeared in a supernatural flame.\n\n'From this time, Sr\u00e1vasti remained one of the principal seats of Buddhist learning; and 12 centuries afterwards, the Chinese pilgrim collected with reverence the traditions of his faith which lingered round the sacred city. At the end of the 2nd century B.C., Rahulata, the sixteenth of the Buddhist patriarchs, died here after having imparted his secret lore to the king's son, Sanghananadi; and at the Fourth Buddhist Synod, convened by the so-called Emperor Kanishka, the Jetavana furnished one of the three principal sects of Sthaviras or Buddhist doctors.\n\n'The greatest political importance ever reached by this State was in the reign of Vikram\u00e1ditya, who, in the middle of the 2nd century A.D., overthrew the mightiest king in India, the Ghav\u00e1hana of Kashmir; and as ruler of a vast dominion stretching from Pesh\u00e1war to M\u00e1lw\u00e1, and from M\u00e1lw\u00e1 to Bengal, assumed with some show of right the title of Emperor of Jambudirpa or the Indian continent. Contrary to the traditions of his capital, he was a bigoted adherent of the Br\u00e1hmanical religion; and the legends connected with his rebuilding of the sacred places at Ajodhya and Debi P\u00e1tan show how low the fortunes of that creed had fallen in these parts when he lent it his powerful support. Both were a complete jungle, and he restored the localities of the birth of R\u00e1ma and of his passage to heaven by measurements from the R\u00e1m\u00e1yana. His identifications probably are the base of the topography of the present day. The remains of this monarch's tank and temple still exist at Debi P\u00e1tan. His death appears to have been followed by open disputes between the rival faiths; and the story that a distinguished Buddhist, Vasubandhu, worsted the Br\u00e1hmans in argument, may refer to a more material victory, especially as we find that his still more distinguished predecessor, Man or Nita, had been worsted in argument by the Br\u00e1hmans under Vikram\u00e1ditya.\n\n'The Ajodhya tradition,' says Mr. Benett, 'preserves the correct story of the fall of this dynasty. It relates that after a glorious reign of eighty years, Vikram\u00e1ditya was visited by a Jogi, Samudra P\u00e1l, who, after exhibiting several remarkable miracles, induced the monarch to allow his spirit to be temporarily transferred to a corpse. The royal body was no sooner vacant than Samudra P\u00e1l projected his own spirit into it, and refused to evacuate. By this disreputable trick, he obtained the throne of Ajodhya and Sr\u00e1vasti, which he and his descendants retained for 17 generations. The fact contained in this singular legend is that Samudra Gupta, who reigned for the first forty years of the 3rd century A.D., overthrew the local dynasty and himself reigned in their stead. The period of eighty years, as the duration of the rule of Vikram\u00e1ditya and his descendants, is exceedingly probable; and it is\nsingular, though much weight cannot be attached to the coincidence, that from Samudra Gupta to Gay\u00e1ditya, the last of the Aditya monarchs of Kanauj, there are exactly seventeen names of the great Vaisya Emperors who governed Northern India.\n\n'The Chinese pilgrims did not, of course, omit to visit so sacred a city. Fa-Hian in the commencement of the 5th century found it inhabited by 200 poor families, and the grand building in decay; and 150 years later, when Hiuen Tsiang arrived, the desolation was complete, and only a few monks haunted the ruins.\n\n'It was destined, however, to recover for a while before it finally disappeared from history; and it is here that I must refer to its connection with the origin of a third religion, that of the Jains. The third of their Tirthank\u00e1ras, Shambh\u00fa N\u00e1th, was born at S\u00e1watthi; both his immediate predecessors and both successors were born at the neighbouring city of Ajodhya. There is still a small Jain temple dedicated to Sobh\u00e1 N\u00e1th. I have no doubt that Sobh\u00e1 N\u00e1th and Shambh\u00fa N\u00e1th, S\u00e1watthi and Sr\u00e1vasti, are the same, and that this was the birthplace of the third Tirthank\u00e1ra. The eighth of these supernatural beings was born at Chandripur; and this place is always identified in local tradition with Sahet Mahet, as I shall have occasion to remark when I come to the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata legend. Since the best authorities differ by about 1500 years as to the probable date of these patriarchs, and their very existence is a fair subject for doubt, I shall not venture to conjecture on their connection with the rise of a strong Jain kingdom in the 9th and 10th centuries. Of this dynasty little more is known than of that of Vikram\u00e1-ditya; one great victory throws them into the full light of history, and an interesting legend accounts for their downfall. Local tradition gives the following list of names:\u2014(1) M\u00e1yura Dhw\u00e1ja; (2) Hansa Dhw\u00e1ja; (3) Makara Dhw\u00e1ja; (4) Sudhanya Dhw\u00e1ja; (5) Suhiral or Suhel Deo or Dal. These are diversely reputed to have been either Th\u00e1rus, or of some R\u00e1jput house. Considering the almost certain origin of the modern R\u00e1jputs, the two accounts may both be true; but, as they were Jains, some confusion about their caste is easily intelligible. What is utterly baffling is that the second and fourth are the heroes of one of the episodes of the Drigvij\u00e1ya section of the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata. The only monarch who is really historical is the last, whose capital was at Sr\u00e1vasti, and who had a fort at Asokpur or Hat\u00edla or Raza, about half-way on the road between Gonda and Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d. The tradition connecting him with Dumhria Dih is clearly transferred from the recollections of the subsequent Dom dynasty. When S\u00e1l\u00e1r Mas\u00e1\u00fad crossed the Gogra, he met Suhel Dal at Hat\u00edla, and the Jains were apparently defeated, though the place is still reverenced as the scene of the martyrdom of a distinguished Muhammadan officer. The invaders pushed to the north, and, if tradition is to be believed, fought another great battle under the walls\nof Sahet Mahet, which contains the tomb of another martyr. Finally, after a long occupation of the country, the decisive battle was fought at Bahraich, where the Musalm\u00e1ns were completely exterminated. In the indecisive conflicts and prolonged encampment in a hostile country, in all, in fact, but its denouement, the story bears a strong resemblance to that of the Path\u00e1n conquest of Utraula in the time of Sult\u00e1n Sher Sh\u00e1h S\u00far.\n\n'It is related that only about forty years after this victory the Jain house fell. The last king, whose name is not given, was passionately devoted to the chase, and returned one evening just as the sun was setting. It would have been a sin to eat after sunset, and the queen, in order to secure the royal supper, sent up to the roof the exceedingly beautiful wife of his younger brother. The experiment succeeded, and the sun stayed to enjoy the sight as long as she stood there. When the feast was over, she descended, and the sun at once disappeared. The astonished king inquired the cause, and was determined to see with his own eyes the wonder-working beauty. His incestuous passion was punished by the ruin of his State, and amidst a terrific storm the whole city was turned bottom upwards. The modern name Sahet Mahet, says the legend, is descriptive of this inversion. This story is valuable as putting beyond reasonable doubt the first religion to which these kings belonged\u2014the inability to eat after sunset, which is the point on which the whole turns, being derived from the Jain reluctance to sacrifice insect life.\n\n'The chronology is also not without its value, and I have no doubt points to the conquest of the country by the first of the great Rahtor kings of Kanauj, Sr\u00ed Chandradeva. In the last half of the 11th century, he made a pilgrimage to Ajodhya and Kus\u00e1la (i.e. Gonda); and with a Kshattriya prince, pilgrimage is often another word for military expedition\u2014\"na Kshattriya ka bhagat na m\u00fasal ka dhanuk\"\u2014\"You cannot make a saint of a Kshattriya, or a bow of a rice pestle.\" An inscription of his descendant, the ill-starred J\u00e1i Chandra, has been found at Ajodhya.\n\n'With the Ghori conquest of India, the history of Sahet Mahet comes absolutely to an end, and it only remains for me to notice one more local legend. Everywhere in the neighbourhood, it is told that the real name of the city before its overthrow was Chandrik\u00e1puri or Chandripur; and that it was here that Hansa Dhw\u00e1ja reigned, and Arjuna gained his very unheroic victory over the brave and beautiful Sudhania.\n\n'All that now remains of this once famous city is the great fortress on the banks of the R\u00e1pti, with a smaller ruin to the south-west, a lofty mound due south on the Balr\u00e1mpur and Bahraich road, and numerous small piles of bricks, probably the remains of ancient stupas,\nscattered here and there within a distance of 2 miles of the main city. The fortress is in shape a semicircular crescent, with the concave side facing the river, and is completely surrounded by solid brick walls, the highest remains being to the west, where the ruins of the river bastion are still 50 feet in height. The ordinary walls vary from a greatest elevation of 40 feet on the western front to a lowest of 20 feet along the east and south-east. The interior is covered with jungle, so dense in parts as hardly to admit of the passage of an elephant, and broken into undulations by the remains of temples and palaces underneath. All the principal buildings were in the western half, and it is there that the undergrowth is the thickest, only ceasing along two or three broad streets which have been left bare, and indicate the chief features of the old city. The main street runs right through the centre, and is built so as to command a view of the great mound Or\u00e1 Jh\u00e1r from one end to the other. To the south it debouches by one of the principal gateways; and at the north it ends in a small square, containing among other lofty remains the two principal mounds, which may be identified with the Sudatt\u00e1s house and the Angulimati, a stupa mentioned by Hiuen Tsiang. The dense brushwood, and the possibility that the city which he saw may have been considerably altered by the later Jain dynasty, renders the application of that traveller's descriptions a difficult and hazardous task; but I am inclined to conjecture that his palace of Parasen\u00e1ditya was situated among the mounds of the south-eastern corner, where now stands the small Jain temple.\n\n'The next principal building mentioned by him, both in his Life and in the Si-yu-ki, is the Hall of the Law built by that monarch for Buddha, which would have been situated between the palace and the main street, while Prajapati's Vih\u00e1ra would have formed the whole or part of the long and even line of buildings which face the west of the street. The north-west corner of the ruin contains a large open space with a small pond in its centre, and a nearly straight road running from it to another southern gateway, and converging with the main street on the Or\u00e1 Jh\u00e1r. The eastern half has no very important remains, though the surface is broken everywhere with the d\u00e9bris of houses, and it was here probably that the common people had their quarters. The walls are pierced with numerous gateways, the principal being at either end of the main street and the north-eastern bastion, and in the middle and southern corner of the west wall.\n\n'At the distance of half a mile from the south-west gate, and separated from the main town by swamps, which probably mark the course of the old moat, is another considerable ruin, identified by Hiuen Tsiang with the old Jetavana, one of the most famous monasteries in India. It is a singular fact that this feature is exactly repro-\nduced in the remains of R\u00e1ngi in R\u00e1i Bareli, where a similar oblong ruin lies at the same distance and direction from the main town. The remainder of the Chinese pilgrim\u2019s measurements seem to have been taken from this point; but it is difficult to select among the numerous mounds the remains of the great Vih\u00e1ra and its rival the idol temple. Nearly a mile to the east of the Jetavana is the high congeries of bricks known, as is the Mani Parbat at Ajodhya, by the name Or\u00e1 Jh\u00e1r or \u201cbasket shakings,\u201d and supposed to be the place where R\u00e1ma\u2019s labourers emptied out their baskets of earth. This is identified with some probability by General Cunningham with the Purvavar\u00e1ma built by the lady Vais\u00e1kha in honour of Buddha. The top is protected by the tombs of two Muhammadan saints, but General Cunningham cleared one of the sides, and found four pilasters of an exceedingly ancient style of architecture. From the fact that two of the chief thoroughfares of the city so converge as to command a view of this mound, I should conjecture that it was more ancient than the plan of the present remains, and consequently one of the oldest monuments left in the neighbourhood. As yet very little is known of this very interesting ruin, which must contain relics that would do much to elucidate some of the darkest and most interesting periods of Indian history. I was once able to spend a few days in excavating, and dug more than 20 feet deep into the crown of the Angulimati\u00e1 st\u00fapa; but beyond disclosing a square building of 24 feet each way, with a partition wall down the centre, and a second wall running all round the building at a distance of 4 feet, I discovered nothing of interest. It is somewhat difficult to get labourers, as the neighbouring villagers have a superstitious dread of interfering with the old city, and will not even enter it after sunset. A storm of thunder and lightning, which came on when I encamped there on a second occasion, was interpreted as a manifest token of the demons\u2019 displeasure with the man who had violated their haunts.\n\nS\u00e1hibganj.\u2014Town in the D\u00e1man-i-koh tract of the Sant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s District, Bengal; situated in lat. 25\u00b0 14' 30\" N., and long. 87\u00b0 40' 3\" E., on the deep channel of the Ganges, which at all seasons runs close under the town, and contiguous to the station on the loop-line of the East Indian Railway. Owing to its favourable position, S\u00e1hibganj, although only founded so recently as 1862, has become of late years a great d\u00e9p\u00f4t for the exchange of traffic between the river and the rail, and has attracted to itself trade before localized at Bh\u00e1galpur, Pirpaint\u00ed, R\u00e1jmah\u00e1l, and other marts of less note. Population (1881) 6512, namely, Hindus, 4776; Muhammadans, 1424; and \u2018others,\u2019 312. Municipal income (1883-84), \u00a3685; incidence of taxation, 1s. 6\u00bdd. per head. In 1876-77, the total registered trade of S\u00e1hibganj was valued at more than \u00a3450,000, including exports, imports, and in many\ncases re-exportations. Local produce is received by river from the trans-Gangetic tracts of North Maldah, Purniah, and Bh\u00e1galpur; while European goods come up by rail from Calcutta, to be distributed in the same Districts. In 1876-77, the principal items under the former head were\u2014indigo, \u00a386,000; oil-seeds, \u00a338,000; rice, \u00a328,000; hides and stone, \u00a327,000 each; wheat, \u00a317,000: and under the latter head\u2014cotton piece-goods, \u00a338,000; salt, \u00a312,000.\n\nA registration station was first established at S\u00e1hibganj in 1872, to ascertain the amount of river traffic passing along the Ganges between Lower Bengal on the one hand, and Behar and the Upper Provinces on the other. During the three years 1872-74, the average number of laden cargo boats passing S\u00e1hibganj both ways was about 33,000; the total weight of the cargoes amounted to about 10 million maunds, or say 360,000 tons a year. The down-stream traffic is by far the larger of the two, especially during the latter half of the year, when the river is in flood. Nearly half the down-stream traffic consisted of the single item of oil-seeds, which amounted to nearly 100,000 tons a year, sent chiefly from the Behar marts of Revelganj and Patn\u00e1. Next came wheat, pulses and gram, sugar and saltpetre; but none of these exceeded 20,000 tons a year. The up-stream traffic predominates during the first half of the year, the boats being often towed up by rope from the bank, assisted by sails. The chief cargoes were rice, about 100,000 tons a year; and salt, 40,000 tons. In 1876-77, the total number of boats that passed the registration station was 43,020, thus classified\u2014upstream, 12,379 laden and 9179 empty; down-stream, 18,419 laden and 3043 empty.\n\nS\u00e1hibganj.\u2014Civil station of Gay\u00e1 District, Bengal.

Exports of rice, molasses, and sundri wood; imports of salt, oil, tobacco, cloth, and pulses.\nS\u00e1hibi (Sabi).\u2014Hill stream in Gurg\u00e1on District, Punjab; rises in R\u00e1jput\u00e1na near the S\u00e1mbhar Lake, flows through the Riw\u00e1ri tract, and empties itself into the Najafgarh jhil or lake on the borders of Delhi District. It frequently submerges the land near the foot of the hills, which thus becomes extremely rich and fertile. The water is utilized by means of numerous dams, which force it to spread over the face of the country, and check the violence of its course near the hills.\n\nSahispur.\u2014Town in Bijnaur (Bijnor) District, North-Western Provinces.\u2014See SAHASPUR.\n\nSahisw\u00e1n.\u2014Tahsil of Bud\u00e1un District, North-Western Provinces, stretching inward from the north bank of the Ganges, and comprising the pargan\u00e1s of Sahisw\u00e1n and Kot. Area, 473 square miles, of which 328 square miles are returned as cultivated. Population (1881) 192,131, namely, males 103,861, and females 88,270; average density of population, 406 persons per square mile. Classified according to religion, Hindus number 163,018; Muhammadans, 28,962; Jains, 107; and \u2018others,\u2019 44. Of the 441 towns and villages in the tahsil, 333 contain less than five hundred inhabitants; 75 from five hundred to a thousand; 31 from one to five thousand; and 2 upwards of five thousand inhabitants. Land revenue (1881-82), \u00a321,364, or including local rates and cesses levied on land, \u00a323,980. In 1884, Sahisw\u00e1n tahsil contained 1 civil and 1 criminal court; number of police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), 3; strength of regular police, 50 men.\n\nSahisw\u00e1n.\u2014Town and municipality in Bud\u00e1un District, North-Western Provinces, and head-quarters of Sahisw\u00e1n tahsil; situated in lat. 28\u00b0 4' 20\" N., and long. 78\u00b0 47' 20\" E., about a mile from the left bank of the Mah\u00e1wa river, 20 miles from Bud\u00e1un town. Population (1872) 17,063; (1881) 14,605, namely, males 7375, and females 7230. Classified according to religion, there were in 1881\u2014Muhammadans, 7715; Hindus, 6855; Christians, 30; and \u2018others,\u2019 5. Municipal income (1883-84), \u00a3708, of which \u00a3584 was derived from taxation; average incidence of taxation, 9\u00bdd. per head. Tri-weekly markets are held on Mondays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. Good unmetalled roads connect the town with Gunnaur, Bisaul\u00ed, Bilsi, and Ujh\u00e1ni; but the trade of the place is inconsiderable, and there is no manufacture. The keora or screw-pine is largely cultivated in the neighbourhood for the sake of the scent that is extracted from its flower. The public buildings include a masonry bungalow, used as a residence and court-house by District officers on tour; a tahsil office, munstif's court, distillery, good sar\u00e1i, Government charitable dispensary, school-house. A large mound marks the site of an ancient fort, said to have been built by one R\u00e1j\u00e1 Sahasra-B\u00e1hu.\n\nS\u00e1hiwal.\u2014Town and municipality in Sh\u00e1hpur tahsil, Sh\u00e1hpur\nDistrict, Punjab, and former capital of a native chief. Situated in lat. $31^\\circ 58' N.$, and long. $72^\\circ 22' E.$, on the left bank of the Jehlam (Jhelum), 20 miles south of Sh\u00e1hpur town. Founded, according to tradition, by G\u00fal Bahlak, one of the ancestors of the Baluch chiefs who held the neighbouring country until the time of Ranj\u00edt Singh. Population (1881) 8880, namely, Hindus, 4813; Muhammadans, 3881; and Sikhs, 186. Number of houses, 2130. Municipal income (1883-84), \u00a3784, or an average of 1s. 9\u00bdd. per head of the population. The town is badly built, and surrounded by a stagnant marsh, which gives rise to much malaria; but strenuous efforts have been taken to abate this evil. S\u00e1hiw\u00e1l carries on a brisk trade in cotton, grain, and gh\u00ed with M\u00falt\u00e1n (Mooltan) and Sukkur (Sakkar), and is one of the chief commercial towns in Sh\u00e1hpur District. The merchants act as bankers and money-lenders for the cultivating classes, while many of them farm estates on their own account. Manufactures of hardware, of turnery in wood and ivory, and lacquered ware. Town hall, dispensary, police station, school-house, s\u00e1rdi.\n\n**Sahpau.**\u2014Town in S\u00e1d\u00e1b\u00e1d tahsil, Muttra (Mathura) District, North-Western Provinces; situated in lat. $27^\\circ 26' 13'' N.$, and long. $78^\\circ 10' 49'' E.$, 7 miles west of S\u00e1d\u00e1b\u00e1d town, and close to Jalesar road station on the East Indian Railway. Population (1881) 3635. Police station and post-office. Bi-weekly markets on Sundays and Wednesdays. A small house-tax is raised for police and conservancy purposes.\n\n**S\u00e1h\u00faka.**\u2014Petty State in the Jh\u00e1law\u00e1r division of K\u00e1thiaw\u00e1r, Bombay Presidency; consisting of 1 village, with 1 tribute-payer. Area, 6 square miles. Population (1881) 920. Estimated revenue, \u00a3265, of which \u00a351, 18s. is paid as tribute to the British Government, and \u00a36, 10s. to the Naw\u00e1b of Jun\u00e1garh.\n\n**Sahy\u00e1dri.**\u2014Mountain range in Bombay Presidency. The term Sahy\u00e1dri is applied to the entire system of the Western Ghats (q.v.) from the T\u00e1pti river to Cape Comorin, but more especially to the ranges in the coast Districts of the Deccan. The Sahy\u00e1dri hills in this sense commence in Kh\u00e1ndesh District, and run south and southwest, as far as Goa, with scattered continuations to the P\u00e1l Gh\u00e1t. Ratn\u00e1giri may be taken as an example of the coast Districts. The range here forms the continuous eastern boundary, running parallel to the sea. It varies in height from 2000 to 3000 feet, though some of the peaks attain an altitude of 5000 feet. The summits of the Sahy\u00e1dri hills, both above and below the main range, are often crowned or girded by large massive basaltic rocks. These, with little aid from art, can be made fortresses most difficult to reach, and to look at, almost impregnable. Many of them have springs of the finest water; and in all a supply can be secured in cisterns and reservoirs. The Sahy\u00e1dris are\ncrossed by numerous passes, and by a few made roads constructed by\nthe British Government. On the crest of these passes, the scenery is\ngrand. Mountains rise behind mountains three or four thousand feet\nhigh, covered with trees, except where the black rock is too solid\neven for the hardiest shrub to take root. Both at the opening and the\nclose of the south-west monsoon, tempests and thunder-storms are\ncommon. West of the Sahy\u00e1dri hills, which on that side rise precipitously\nfrom base to crest, the country is comparatively low, and the plateaux\nare seldom more than 500 feet above the sea-level. The lower hills\nare for the most part bare and treeless. The east face of the Sahy\u00e1dris\ngradually slopes down to the table-land of the central plateau of the\nMadras Presidency, from 1000 to 3000 feet above sea-level.\n\nThe Sahy\u00e1dri hills in their geological relations have a wider applica-\ntion, and include, as stated above, the whole Western Gh\u00e1ts from the\nT\u00e1pti to Cape Comorin in the extreme south of the peninsula. The\nauthors of the official Geology of India (Messrs. Medlicott and Blanford)\nhave described the Sahy\u00e1dri hills in this sense as follows:\u2014'The\nSahy\u00e1dri range consists to the northward of horizontal or nearly\nhorizontal strata of basalt and similar rocks, cut into a steep scarp on\nthe western side by denudation, and similarly eroded, though less\nabruptly, to the eastward. The highest summits, such as Mah\u00e1balesh-\nwar (4717 feet), are perfectly flat-topped, and are clearly undenuded\nremnants of a great elevated plain. South of about 16\u00b0 N. lat., the\nhorizontal igneous rocks disappear, and the range is composed of\nancient metamorphic strata. Here there is in some places a distinct\nconnection between the strike of the foliation and the direction of the\nhills; but still the connection is only local, and the dividing range\nconsists either of the western scarp of the Mysore plateau, or of isolated\nhill groups, owing their form apparently to denudation. Where the\nrocks are so ancient as those are that form all the southern portion of\nthe Sahy\u00e1dri, it is almost impossible to say how far the original direction\nof the range is due to axes of disturbance; but the fact that all the\nprincipal elevations, such as the Nilgiris, Palnis, etc., some peaks of\nwhich rise to over 8000 feet, are plateaux and not ridges, tends to show\nthat denudation has played the principal share in determining their\ncontour. The southern portion of the Sahy\u00e1dri range is entirely\nseparated by a broad gap (the Palghat, q.v.), through which the\nrailway from Madras to Beypur passes.' See also the article GHATS\n(Western).\n\nSai.\u2014River of Oudh, rising in Hardoi District in lat. 27\u00b0 10' N., and\nlong. 80\u00b0 32' E. (Thornton), between the G\u00famti and the Ganges. It\nflows in a tortuous south-easterly direction through Oudh, passing\nR\u00e1i Bareli and Part\u00e1bgarh towns, enters the North-West Provinces in\nJaunpur District, and falls into the G\u00famti on its right or south bank a\nfew miles below Jaunpur town. Navigable in the rains for country boats of 10 tons burden as far as R\u00e1\u00ed Bareli town. Captain Wilford mentioned that this river 'is called Sambu and Sukti, and in the spoken dialects, Sye, because it abounds with small shells. This is really the case, as I have repeatedly observed while surveying or travelling along its banks. They are all fossil, small, and embedded in its banks, and appear here and there when laid bare by the encroachments of the river; they consist chiefly of cockles and periwinkles.' Wilford identifies the Sai with 'the Sambus of Megasthenes;' but the Sambus is mentioned by Arrian as a tributary of the Jumna. Arrowsmith's old map of India, '50 kos to the degree,' compiled chiefly from military sources, showed a cross communication between the Sai and the G\u00famti some distance above Lucknow. This does not appear in later maps.\n\n**Said\u00e1b\u00e1d.\u2014Tahsil in Muttra District, North-Western Provinces.**\n\n*See SAVYIDABAD.*\n\n**Said\u00e1pet.** \u2014 *T\u00e1luk* or Sub-division of Chengalpat (Chingleput) District, Madras Presidency. Area, 342 square miles. Population (1881) 204,580, namely, males 102,676, and females 101,904; occupying 29,558 houses, in 3 towns and 271 villages. Hindus number 189,475; Muhammadans, 9266; Christians, 5723; and 'others,' 116.\n\nThe general appearance of the country is flat and uninteresting, with here and there ridged or conical hills of no great elevation. The soil is of various qualities, being, as a rule, better in proportion to its distance from the sea. Sandy, red, ferruginous, and alluvial soils represent the degrees of progressive fertility. Weaving is carried on in several villages. In one or two villages red handkerchiefs and Muhammadan cloth are manufactured for export, chiefly to Penang and Singapur. Surrounding, as it does, Madras city, the Said\u00e1pet *t\u00e1luk* is well supplied with roads. The chief are the Great Southern Trunk Road, the High Western Trunk Road, and the Great Northern Trunk Road. The Madras and South Indian Railways also traverse the *t\u00e1luk*. Water carriage is not wanting through the low-lying sandy tract on the coast; the Buckingham Canal runs along the whole length of the coast.\n\nIn Said\u00e1pet *t\u00e1luk* are situated the Red Hills and Chembramb\u00e1kam tanks.\u2014*See MADRAS CITY.* The Red Hills tank or reservoir, which affords the main water-supply to Madras city, is distant 8 miles from Madras. The tank itself derives its supply from the Cholavaram tank, which in its turn is fed by an embankment across the Cortelli\u00e1r river, 22 miles from Madras. The Chembramb\u00e1kam tank is a large irrigation reservoir about 14 miles from Madras, formed by an embankment 7100 yards in length, connecting high ground on one side with a rocky spur on the other. It is provided with 8 irrigation sluices, and with 3 masonry\nweirs aggregating 1192 feet in length, while its capacity is 2799 million cubic feet, and the area of its water-spread 8\u00b795 square miles. The tank is an old native work, and the improvements consist of the extension of its capacity, and the increase of its water-supply. The chief sources of its supply are from anicuts across the Cortelliar and Cooum rivers. In 1883-84, the area irrigated and revenue derived was\u2014first crop, 12,868 acres; revenue, \u00a33982: second crop, 5652 acres; revenue, \u00a31511: total revenue, \u00a35493. The surplus revenue of the year was \u00a32454.\n\nIn 1883-84, the Said\u00e1pet taluk contained 1 civil and 4 criminal courts; police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), 10; regular police, 223 men. Land revenue, \u00a325,892.\n\nSaid\u00e1pet (Sydapet).\u2014Chief town and administrative head-quarters of Chengalpat (Chingleput) District, Madras Presidency, and a station on the South Indian Railway; situated in lat. 13\u00b0 1' 32\" N., and long. 80\u00b0 15' 40\" E., 5 miles from Madras city. Population (1881) 4917, inhabiting 568 houses. Hindus numbered 4655; Muhammadans, 199; and Christians, 63.\n\nThe well-known Government model farm at Said\u00e1pet was established in 1865, under the Governorship of Sir William Denison. From the beginning it was fortunate in the appointment of Mr. Robertson as its first superintendent. Many important agricultural experiments have been made, and some have produced encouraging results, indicating the general direction in which improvements can be effected in the agriculture of the Madras Presidency. Attention has been given to subsoil drainage, improved tillage, the restoration of exhausted soils, and the proper utilization of irrigation water; the fertilization of arable soils by the use of lime, saltpetre, oil-cake, poudrette, and other manures available in Southern India, but now unused by the r\u0101yats; the introduction of new crops, suited to the climate of India and adapted for cultivation under an improving agricultural practice, such as maize, Sorghum saccharatum, Carolina rice, Guinea grass and other grasses, New Orleans cotton and other superior varieties of cotton, tobacco, etc.; the production of live fences, in view of affording protection, shelter, and fuel; the introduction of water-lifts, barn machines, carts, ploughs, cultivators, cattle hoes, reaping knives, etc., of improved construction; and the improvement of similar kinds of machines and implements now in use in this country; improvement of the live-stock of the country by careful breeding and feeding, and by acclimatizing new breeds, etc.\n\nIn order to extend the practical utility of these experiments, a school of agriculture was opened in connection with the farm in 1876. A class of 30 pupils joined in the first year, of whom 9 came from the Bombay Presidency. A handsome building, used\nas an agricultural college and museum, has been erected. A chemical laboratory is attached to it, and a veterinary hospital has been opened. Income from the Said\u00e1pet farm (1883-84), \u00a34546; expenditure, \u00a39221, showing a loss to Government of \u00a34675. The farming operations at Said\u00e1pet have now been given up by Government, except so far as required for the practical instruction of the pupils in the agricultural school.\n\n**Saidnagar.**\u2014Town in Jal\u00e1un District, North-Western Provinces.\u2014See SAVYDNAGAR.\n\n**Saidpur.**\u2014T\u00e1luk in Shik\u00e1rpur District, Sind, Bombay Presidency.\u2014See SAVYIDPUR.\n\n**Saidpur.**\u2014Town in Far\u00eddpur District, Bengal.\u2014See SAVYIDPUR.\n\n**Saidpur.**\u2014Tahsil and village in Gh\u00e1z\u00edpur District, North-Western Provinces.\u2014See SAVYIDPUR.\n\n**Saidw\u00e1l\u00e1.**\u2014Town in Montgomery District, Punjab.\u2014See SAVYIDWALA.\n\n**S\u00e1ifganj.**\u2014Town in Purniah District, Bengal; situated in lat. 25\u00b0 32' N., and long. 87\u00b0 37' 36\" E., 20 miles distant from Purniah town. The population of S\u00e1ifganj itself is under 2000; but it is closely surrounded by suburban villages, which bring up the total number of inhabitants to about 10,000. The town contains a vernacular school, and a police outpost; there are also 3 Muhammadan mosques, a Hindu math or temple built in 1822, and two old tanks excavated in 1807 and 1822 respectively. The value of rice annually exported from S\u00e1ifganj is estimated at \u00a325,000, and that of mustard at \u00a35000; the number of blankets annually manufactured is valued at \u00a3600. S\u00e1ifganj was founded about 150 years ago by the Naw\u00e1b S\u00e1if Kh\u00e1n, and is now one of the most populous places in Purniah. It is the head-quarters of the sheep-breeding trade of the District.\n\n**S\u00e1ifganj Pirwaha.**\u2014Village in Purniah District, Bengal.

Area, 114 square miles. Population (1881) 29,723, namely, males 15,579, and females 14,144; occupying 6128 houses, in 69 villages. Hindus number 19,910; Muhammadans, 1508; Jains, 901; Sikhs, 15; Bhils, 7169; Moghi\u00e1s, 212; and Min\u00e1s, 8. Estimated revenue of the chief, \u00a314,800; j\u00e1girs, \u00a311,640; lands held for charitable purposes, \u00a313,920. This State originally formed a part of Ratlam. On the death of Kesari Singh, R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Ratlam, in 1709, his eldest son, M\u00e1n Singh, succeeded to the lands forming the present State of Ratlam, and J\u00e1i Singh, his second son, to Sail\u00e1na. An annual tribute of \u00a34200 was formerly paid to Sindhia, but is now assigned to the British Government in part payment of the Gwalior Contingent, under\nthe same conditions as the tribute of Ratlam. The present R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Sail\u00e1na, D\u00fali Singh, is a Rahtor R\u00e1jput, and was born about 1838. He receives a salute of 11 guns. The military force of the State consisted, in 1881-82, of 3 field guns, 15 artillerymen, 40 horse, and 225 foot. In 1881-82, 1207 maunds of opium and 199 maunds of cotton were produced.\n\n**Sail\u00e1na (Sill\u00e1na).**\u2014Chief town of Sail\u00e1na State, Western M\u00e1lw\u00e1 Agency, Central India.

Lat. 13\u00b0 0' 18\" N., long. 80\u00b0 14' 11\" E. Population (1881) 15,013, namely, 7404 males and 7609 females. Hindus number 10,645; Muhammadans, 1902; Christians, 2416; and \u2018others,\u2019 50. Number of houses, 2264. The town possesses a fine church, several chapels, numerous military buildings, including a handsome artillery mess-house, post-office, and cantonment magistrate\u2019s court. It is a pretty place, and well kept. The b\u00e1z\u00e1r and native huts are hidden away to the eastward, which adds to the favourable impression made on the visitor who sees it for the first time. The church, standing at the southern end of the parade-ground, is one of the best-looking edifices of its kind in the country. It is seated for 500 men and 80 officers and their families. There are, besides, a Wesleyan chapel at the foot of the Mount steps, a Roman Catholic chapel for the European troops, and another small Roman Catholic church, 74 feet long by 25 wide, built in 1764 by the boatmen of Madras, and dedicated to the \u2018Presentation of the Blessed Virgin.\u2019 The soil is gravelly, and the health of the station is exceptionally good, epidemic cholera being of rare occurrence. The garrison consists of 2 field\nbatteries, with a half battery of garrison artillery, and a detachment of Native infantry.\n\nThe 'Mount' itself is a granite and syenite rock, about 220 feet above sea-level, overlooking the cantonment. The ascent is made by a flight of some 200 steps. On its summit stands the curious old Portuguese church of 'The Expectation of the Blessed Virgin.' This is built over the spot where the Portuguese in 1547 discovered the celebrated Mount Cross, attributed to the legendary evangelism of Saint Thomas. Lucena gives the following account of the finding of the Cross:\u2014'It was met with on digging for the foundations of a hermitage amid the ruins which marked the spot of the martyrdom of the Apostle Saint Thomas. On one face of the slab was a cross in relief, with a bird like a dove over it, with its wings expanded as the Holy Ghost is usually represented when descending on our Lord at His baptism, or on our Lady at her Annunciation. This cross was erected over the altar at the chapel which was built on the new sanctuary.' Dr. Burnell (Indian Antiquary, 1874, p. 313) says: 'This account is, no doubt, accurate, for the Portuguese on first visiting the mount found the Christian church in ruins, and occupied by a native fakir. The description of the slab is also accurate. It does not appear what cause had destroyed the Christian community here, but it probably was owing to the political disturbances attending the war between the Muhammadans of the north and the Hindu kingdom of Vijayanagar.'\n\nReferring to an Italian account (in the 17th century) of the Cross and the Mount festival, Dr. Burnell continues: 'The cross is built into the wall behind the altar in a church on the Great Mount, which is served by a native priest under the Goa jurisdiction. An annual festival is held here, which brings a large assemblage of native Christians to the spot, and causes an amount of disorder which the European Catholic clergy of Madras have in vain tried to put down.'\n\nIn Anglo-Indian history, and notably in the wars of the Karn\u00e1tik, Saint Thomas' Mount was a place of great importance. The battle fought here on the 7th February 1759 was one of the fiercest struggles of the Franco-British wars in India. It is thus described by Mr. Crole:\u2014'Colonel Calliaud had been summoned from the south to assist in raising the siege of Madras. He took post at the Mount, with his right at a deserted little temple at the north-east of the present parade-ground, and his left supported by a house called Carvalho's garden, where he posted four pieces of cannon. His troops included the contingent brought by the Company's partisan Muhammad Isaf, and consisted of 2200 horse, 2500 foot, and 6 cannons. Of these, however, only 1500 natives, 80 Europeans, and 12 artillerymen were possessed of the slightest discipline. Lally's forces aggregated 2600, half of whom were Europeans, and all disciplined. He had, besides, 8 guns,\npossessing a great superiority in weight of metal. The fight lasted from early morning till five p.m., when the enemy, to Colonel Calliaud's intense relief, retreated. The latter had ammunition sufficient to have lasted for about a couple of minutes more.' 'On the 20th March 1769, Haidar Al\u00ed, who had marched within 5 miles of Madras, met Mr. Dupr\u00e9, the senior Member of Council, and here the disgraceful treaty of the 2nd April was signed. In 1774, at the suggestion of Colonel James, the Mount was established as the headquarters of the artillery. The garrison of the Mount formed the major part of the force (under Sir Hector Munro) that ought to have saved Baillie in 1780. During its absence, only five companies of Sepoys and 4 guns had been left for the protection of the Mount, and a temporary earthwork was raised to strengthen the place against attack. This has long been levelled, but a slight depression crossing the plain midway between Palavaram and the Mount indicates the position of what went by the name of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 Ditch.'\u2014Chengalpat District Manual, p. 73.\n\nAccording to Dr. Burnell, the date of the cross tablet and its Pehlevi inscription is probably about the 8th century.\n\n**Saint Thome (Mal\u00e1ipur, Mylapore).**\u2014Suburb of Madras City (q.v.).

A fine well-wooded hill, forming the terminal point in which two divergent spurs of the range re-unite. Upon its summit stands the sanitarium for Sh\u00e1hpur and Mi\u00e1nw\u00e1li, at an elevation of 5010 feet above sea-level, with plenty of excellent building space available. Wild olive trees are abundant, and the oak thrives well. According to daily meteorological observations made by the Civil Surgeon of Sh\u00e1hpur between the middle of June and the middle of October 1866, the average temperature of Sakeswar was 75\u00b0 F., or one degree less than summer heat in England. The climate of Sakeswar, and indeed of the whole of the higher parts of the Salt Range, is believed to be well adapted for Europeans, and very favourable in cases of dysentery and phthisis, which, as a rule, do not derive any benefit in the Him\u00e1layan sanitaria. The great drawback to Sakeswar is the scarcity of good drinking water. There are, however, many places in the neighbourhood where excellent water is procurable; and by having recourse to tanks, a sufficiency of water could be stored for a considerable number of people.\n\n**Sakhar.**\u2014Sub-division, t\u00e1luk, and town in Shik\u00e1rpur District, Sind, Bombay Presidency.\u2014See Sukkur.\n\n**Sakhera** (or Sankheda).\u2014Town in Baroda State, Bombay Presidency. Population (1881) 4661. The only object of interest is an old fort which surrendered to a small force of British troops in 1802. Customs house, Gujar\u00e1th\u00ed school, and two dharms\u00e1l\u00e1s. The calico-printing and dyeing of Sakhera have a local celebrity; and considerable taste is shown in wood-carving.\n\n**Sakhi-Sarw\u00e1r.**\u2014Famous Muhammadan shrine in Der\u00e1 Gh\u00e1z\u00ed Kh\u00e1n tahsil and District, Punjab. Lat. 30\u00b0 N., long. 70\u00b0 10' 30\" E. The shrine crowns the high bank of a hill stream, at the foot of the Sulaim\u00e1n range, in the midst of arid desert scenery, 'well adapted for the residence of those who desire to mortify the flesh.' Founded in honour of Saidi Ahmad, afterwards known as Sakhi Sarw\u00e1r, the son of an immigrant from B\u00e1ghd\u00e1d, who settled at Sialkot, 12 miles east of M\u00falt\u00e1n, in the year 1220. Saidi Ahmad became a devotee, and having performed a\nvery remarkable series of miracles, was presented by the Delhi Emperor with four mule-loads of money, with which the Sakhi-Sarw\u00e1r shrine was erected. A handsome flight of steps leads from the bed of the stream to the building, constructed at the expense of two Hindu merchants of Lahore. The buildings include\u2014the mausoleum of Sakhi Sarw\u00e1r himself; a monument of B\u00e1ba N\u00e1nak; the tomb of Massam\u00e1t B\u00edb\u00ed Bh\u00e1i, wife of Sakhi Sarw\u00e1r; and a th\u00e1k\u00fardw\u00e1ra. They thus comprise a curious mixture of Hindu and Muhammadan architecture, and are frequented by devotees of all religions. The guardians of the shrine are the descendants of Sakhi Sarw\u00e1r's three servants, among whom the revenues accruing from the offerings are divided in 1650 shares, the descendants of one servant receiving 750 shares, of another 600 shares, and of the third 300 shares. Throughout the year, the shrine forms the resort of numerous mendicants, Hindu and Muhammadan.\n\n**Sakit.**\u2014Ancient and decaying town in Etah District, North-Western Provinces. Lat. 27\u00b0 26' 10\" N., long. 78\u00b0 49' 15\" E. Population (1881) 5435, consisting of 3809 Hindus and 1626 Muhammadans. Sakit stands on an isolated site, 12 miles south-east of Etah town. Its hill was once crowned by a fort; but now only the remains of a large mosque, erected in the 13th century, testify to the former supremacy of the Muhammadan element. On the highest part of the existing town rises a half-finished modern temple, remarkable for its Saracenic arches, supported on slender pillars of richly carved Agra stone\u2014an ambitious work commenced by a commissariat servant (who enriched himself during the Sikh war), but died before its completion. The town clusters around this temple, which, from its conspicuous position, forms a landmark for many miles around. The principal road enters Sakit over a ravine by a fine new bridge, constructed out of the foundations of the old fort. Handsome b\u00e1z\u00e1r, lined by good shops with flat and pointed ornamental fronts. Trees line the roadway and afford a pleasant shade. The sar\u00e1i is now in ruins; the roof of the old mosque is broken down; and the water of the handsome well has become brackish. New brick-built police station on the site of the old fort; post-office; Anglo-vernacular school. Small trade in cotton, grain, and indigo seed. Numerous inscriptions on mosques. Bahlol Lodi died at Sakit in 1488; and Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Lodi planted a colony of Kont Musalm\u00e1ns here in 1520.\n\n**Sakkampatt\u00fa.**\u2014Town in Tenk\u00e1si t\u00e1luk, Tinnevelli District, Madras Presidency. Population (1881) 5945. Hindus number 5559; Muhammadans, 289; and Christians, 97. Number of houses, 1327.\n\n**Sakkaraikottai.**\u2014Town in R\u00e1mn\u00e1d t\u00e1luk, Madura District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 9\u00b0 21' N., long. 78\u00b0 55' E. Population (1881) 3464, dwelling in 501 houses.\nSakleshpur (lit. 'town of the fragmentary Ishwara').\u2014Municipal village in Hassan District, Mysore State; situated in lat. $12^\\circ 57' 20''$ N., and long. $75^\\circ 50' 31''$ E., on the right bank of the Hemavati river, 23 miles west of Hassan town. Population (1881) 1354. Head-quarters of the Manjar\u00e1b\u00e1d t\u00e1luk, and the centre of the coffee trade. The Hemavati is here crossed by an iron girder bridge, carrying the road by which the coffee of the highlands is borne to the seaport of Mangalore.\n\nS\u00e1kol\u00ed.\u2014Eastern tahsil or Sub-division of Bhand\u00e1r\u00e1 District, Central Provinces. Area, 2033 square miles, with 2 towns and 823 villages, and 54,363 houses. Population (1881) 272,481, namely, males 135,362, and females 137,119. Deducting an area of 697 square miles, comprising 17 zamind\u00e1ris or petty chiefships, with a population of 41,731, the area of the British portion of the Sub-division amounts to 1336 square miles, with 2 towns and 608 villages, and 46,444 houses. Population 230,750, namely, males 114,177, and females 116,573; average density, 172.7 persons per square mile. The total adult agricultural population (male and female) in 1881 numbered 77,414 in the Government lands, the average area of available cultivated and cultivable land being 6 acres for each adult agriculturist. Of the total Government area of 1336 square miles, 384 square miles are held revenue-free, while 952 square miles are assessed for Government revenue, of which 420 square miles are cultivated, 179 square miles are cultivable, and 353 square miles are uncultivable waste. Total amount of Government land revenue in 1883, including local rates and cesses levied on land, \u00a316,952, or an average of 1s. 2\u00bdd. per cultivated acre. Total rental paid by cultivators, including rates and cesses, \u00a327,163, or an average of 1s. 11\u00bdd. per cultivated acre. S\u00e1kol\u00ed tahsil contained in 1883, 2 civil and 1 criminal courts, with 3 police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s) and 7 outpost stations, a regular police force numbering 108 men, and a village watch or rural police (chaukid\u00e1rs) numbering 794 men. S\u00e1kol\u00ed village is situated in lat. $21^\\circ 15'$ N., and long. $80^\\circ$ E.\n\nSakrand.\u2014T\u00e1luk of the Naushahro Sub-division, Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d, (Hyder\u00e1b\u00e1d) District, Sind, Bombay Presidency. Area, 1390 square miles. Population (1872) 53,566; (1881) 52,075, namely, males 27,947, and females 24,128. Hindus number 3950; Muhammadans, 45,694; Sikhs, 2406; Christians, 2; and aboriginal tribes, 23. Number of houses, 9216, in 111 villages. Much of the land in the eastern portion is covered with sandhills. Revenue, \u00a31624. The t\u00e1luk in 1882\u201383 contained\u2014criminal courts, 2; police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), 5; regular police, 32 men. Area assessed for land revenue, 42,305 acres; under actual cultivation, 38,847 acres.\n\nSakr\u00e1ypatna (or Sakrep\u00e1t\u00f1a).\u2014Village in Kad\u00far District, Mysore State; situated in lat. $13^\\circ 26'$ N., and long. $75^\\circ 58' 5''$ E., 15 miles by\nroad north-east of Chikmagalur. Population (1871) 1866; not separately returned in the Census Report of 1881. The site of an ancient city locally identified with the capital of Rukmangada, a king mentioned in the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata. The objects now extant include\u2014a monument to Honbilla, a watchman whose life was sacrificed in order to preserve the neighbouring Ayyankere Tank; a huge gun; and an immense slab of stone, 12 feet square and several inches thick, supported on four pillars. In historical times, Sakr\u00e1ypatna passed through the hands of several families of local chiefs, until annexed to the Hindu kingdom of Mysore in 1690. A large fair is held weekly on Fridays. At the annual car festival of Rangan\u00e1th 3000 rams are sacrificed in honour of the god.\n\n**Sakri.**\u2014River of Bengal, rising in Haz\u00e1rib\u00e1gh District, and flowing in a generally northerly direction through Gay\u00e1 and Patn\u00e1 Districts. In Haz\u00e1rib\u00e1gh it has a drainage basin of 810 square miles; and being the central stream in a low well-cultivated valley, it receives from all sides numerous feeders. It has a distinct water system, and preserves its own name while it passes through Gay\u00e1 and Patn\u00e1 Districts on its way to join the Ganges in Monghyr. Throughout its course it is much used for irrigation.\n\n**Sakse.**\u2014Fort and Customs Division, Koi\u00e1ba District, Bombay Presidency.\u2014See SANKSHI.\n\n**Sakt\u00ed.**\u2014Native State, at the eastern limit of Bil\u00e1spur District, Central Provinces, to which it is now attached. Population (1881) 22,819, chiefly Hindus, residing in 117 villages and 3955 houses; area, 115 square miles, of which 41 are cultivated and 47 returned as cultivable waste. Density of population, 198 persons per square mile. Sakt\u00ed was originally one of the Garhj\u00e1t States attached to Sambalpur District. It consists of a curved strip of level country, partly open, partly covered with forest, skirting the base of a range known as the Gunji Hills. Chief products\u2014rice, wheat, oil-seeds, and cotton, besides a small quantity of forest produce, consisting of lac, resin, gum, and mahu\u00e1 fruit. The chief is a R\u00e1j-Gond, and pays a tribute of \u00a335. At present, however (1884), the State is under direct British administration. Total revenue for 1883\u201384, \u00a31680, of which about \u00a31000 was derived from land revenue; expenditure, \u00a31718. In 1872, only 22 persons were returned as able to read and write, or as being under instruction; but since the State has been taken under Government management, a considerable impetus has been given to education, and there are several flourishing village schools. Several good roads connecting the State with neighbouring zam\u00edn\u00e9d\u00e1ris have been constructed, and are reported to be the best fair-weather roads in Bil\u00e1spur. Good dispensary. Sakt\u00ed town lies in lat. 22\u00b0 0' 30\" N., and long. 83\u00b0 E.\n\n**Sal\u00e1mbha.**\u2014Village in Nu\u00f1 tahsil, Gurg\u00e1on District, Punjab; situated\nin the midst of a large saline tract, known as the N\u00fah mah\u00e1ls, near the foot of the Mew\u00e1t Hills, north of Sonah. The salt formerly manufactured here bore the general name of Sal\u00e1mbha salt, but was produced in ten separate places within this region. It was made by the evaporation of brine drawn from wells, together with the washings of saline earth, and was of very inferior quality, containing large amounts of magnesia and other ingredients besides the pure chloride. The total quantity manufactured in 1871-72 was 203,182 maunds. The manufacture, however, has now entirely ceased in this tract, the local product having been driven out of the market by the superior and cheaper S\u00e1mbhar lake salt.\n\nS\u00e1landi (properly S\u00e1lnad\u00ed).\u2014River of Orissa, Bengal, so called from the s\u00e1l forests which it traverses. It rises in the southern slope of the Megh\u00e1sani Mountain in Morbhanj State, and in its upper course is a black-water river with high banks and a bottom of muddy sand. For miles the S\u00e1landi flows through one continuous grove of palms and bamboos; it is navigable for country boats as high as 6 miles from its junction with the Baitaran\u00ed. Its lower course bifurcates into a network of streams interlaced with those of the Mat\u00e1i, a river bringing down the drainage of the country between the K\u00e1nsb\u00e1ns and the S\u00e1landi, and after a tortuous course falling into the Dh\u00e1mr\u00e1 near its mouth. The area of the catchment basin of the S\u00e1landi is 250 square miles; the maximum discharge in flood-time, 60,000 cubic feet; and the average cold-weather discharge, 260 cubic feet.\n\nSal\u00e1ya.\u2014Port in Naw\u00e1nagar State, K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay Presidency. Sal\u00e1ya is the port of Khambh\u00e1l\u00eda, from which town it lies about 9 miles north. Population (1881) 2773. It is probably the best port (with the exception of Bombay and Kar\u00e1chi) on the west coast of India. Owing to the excellence of the harbour, it would make a good terminus for any further extension of the railway. The trade of the country inland would be attracted hither, and shipments might be made direct to and from Europe. The port has two entrances, one between K\u00e1rumbh\u00e1r island and the mainland, narrow and deep; and the other between K\u00e1rumbh\u00e1r and Dh\u00e1ni Bet, about a mile broad. The harbour is perfectly sheltered on the east and north-east by N\u00e1rera Bet and K\u00e1rumbh\u00e1r, and to the west and north-west by the Dh\u00e1ni Bet. On the north-west corner of K\u00e1rumbh\u00e1r island, a lighthouse built of coral, 30 feet high, with an ordinary fixed white light, has recently (1884) been erected by the Naw\u00e1nagar State. The shores of both the mainland and the island are fringed with large coral reefs. The chief exports are gh\u00ed, which is usually sent to Cutch, and cotton to Bombay. The imports are cotton seed from Gujar\u00e1t ports, dates from Basra and Maskat, and timber from the Malabar coast. The port of Sal\u00e1ya was classed among the regular harbours by the Mughal government, and\nappears in the list of ports in the *Mirat-i-Ahmadi* as belonging to Isl\u0101mnagar (Naw\u0101nagar). Post-office and vernacular school.\n\n**Salb\u00e1i** (*Salbye*).\u2014Village in Gwalior State, Central India; situated 32 miles south-east of the fort of Gwalior, in lat. $25^\\circ 51'$ N., long. $78^\\circ 19'$ E. Celebrated for the treaty concluded here in 1782 between the British Government and the Mar\u0101th\u0101 Confederacy, at the close of the struggle for the Peshw\u0101ship which took place after the death of Madhu R\u00e1o Ballal. That treaty provided for the surrender to the Peshw\u0101 of Bassein and other territory captured by the British during the war; and the cession to the British of Salsette, Elephanta, Karanj, and Hog islands off Bombay. Under the third article of the treaty, the right of the British to the town and *pargan\u00e1* of Broach was fully recognised, but these were conferred by Government upon Sindhia in consideration of his services, upon the condition that British trade should be free and unmolested. *(See Aitchison's Treaties and Engagements, vols. iii. and iv., ed. 1876.)*\n\n**S\u00e1lbaldi.**\u2014Village and hill on the M\u00e1r\u00fa river; situated in lat. $21^\\circ 26'$ N., and long. $77^\\circ 59'$ E., 5 miles north of Morsi, partly in Ellichpur District, Berar, and partly in Bet\u00fal District, Central Provinces. Celebrated on account of two springs, one very cold, the other warm. When Sit\u00e1 was deserted by R\u00e1ma, she is said by local tradition to have come to S\u00e1lbaldi, and to have given birth here to two sons, Kusa and Lava. This tradition would identify S\u00e1lbaldi as the scene of the hermitage of Valmiki, whither Sit\u00e1, when pregnant, was banished by R\u00e1ma.\n\n**S\u00e1lbet** (*Shialbet, Searbet, Shalbet*).\u2014Island situated about 2 miles from the coast of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay, in lat. (centre) $20^\\circ 54' 30''$ N., and long. $71^\\circ 33' 30''$ E., 8 miles east-north-east of Jafar\u00e1b\u00e1d and 17 miles from Mowah Point. The island is in an impoverished state. Population (1881) 289. It is about three-quarters of a mile long on its sea-face, and a little more than half a mile broad. Old fortifications stand on its north-west and south points, the latter being strongly constructed. The island is of sandstone, and is included within the State of JAFARABAD. A well in the centre supplies good water. S\u00e1lbet was formerly a famous piratical stronghold, and might, according to Taylor (*Sailing Directory*, p. 360), be made a safe harbour. Such a refuge is much wanted along the south coast of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r. After the island of Diu was acquired by the Portuguese, they seem to have established themselves at S\u00e1lbet and elsewhere on the coast. When, however, the Portuguese power in the northern part of their dominions was curtailed by the fall of Bassein (1739), they were obliged to withdraw from outlying posts like S\u00e1lbet and concentrate their efforts on the defence of Diu.\n\n**Salem** (*Selam*, properly *Shelam*, which is perhaps a corruption of Chera, the name of the ancient monarchy in which the District was\nembraced).\u2014British District in the Madras Presidency, lying between 11\u00b0 2' and 12\u00b0 54' N. lat., and between 77\u00b0 33' and 79\u00b0 6' E. long. Area, 7653 square miles. Population, according to the Census of 1881, 1,599,595 persons. Salem District is bounded on the north by Mysore (Mais\u00far) and North Arcot; on the east by Trichinopoli, and by South and North Arcot; on the south by portions of Coimbatore and Trichinopoli; and on the west by Coimbatore and Mysore. The administrative head-quarters are at Salem Town.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014Except towards the south, the District is hilly, with large plains lying between the several ranges. The chief of these ranges are the Shevaroys (highest point, 5410), the Kalr\u00e1yans (about 4000), the Melagiris (4580), the Kollimalais (4663), the Pachamalais (about 4000), the Yelagiris (4441), the Jev\u00e1dis (3840), the Vatthalama-lais (about 4000), the Erlv\u00e1nis and Valasaimalais (about 3800), the Bodamalais (4019), the Thop\u00far hills, the Thalaimalais. There are also innumerable detached peaks and smaller ranges.\n\nThe District has been described as comprising \u2018three distinct tracts of country, known as the Tal\u00e1gh\u00e1t, the B\u00e1ramah\u00e1l, and the B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t. The Tal\u00e1gh\u00e1t division, as its name implies, is situated below the Eastern Gh\u00e1ts on the level of the Karn\u00e1tik generally, and in soil and climate differs but little from the neighbouring Districts of Trichinopoli and South Arcot. The B\u00e1ramah\u00e1l division includes the whole Salem face of the Gh\u00e1ts and a wide tract of country at their base; and the B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t is situated above the Gh\u00e1ts, on the table-land of Mysore.\u2019 Of the Hos\u00far t\u00e1luk, only one-half to the north is really B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t, the southern half lying considerably below the level of the Mysore plateau. Hos\u00far itself is about 3000 feet above the sea. Dharmapuri is about 1500 feet, and Krishnagiri from 1500 to 2000 feet above sea-level. Tirupat\u00far and Uttankarai lie in one basin, and average slightly over 1350 feet above sea-level. At Salem there is a considerable drop, the town of that name being only 947 feet above the sea. The climate is generally dry, and in the northern portions cooler than in the south, the climate of Hos\u00far being as temperate as that of Bangalore.\n\nThe chief river of the District is the Ka-veri (Cauvery), from the left bank of which a large area in N\u00e1makal is irrigated. The Palar only flows through a few miles of the northern corner of the Tirupat\u00far t\u00e1luk, where it does nearly as much harm as good, as little use is made of the water, and the town of V\u00e1n\u00edambadi lies at the mercy of its floods. In 1874, a considerable portion of this town was washed away, and it is only a question of time when the remainder, hitherto preserved at considerable cost, will follow. The Penner, rising in Mysore territory, flows through Hos\u00far and Krishnagiri to Uttankarai, where, near the South Arcot frontier, it is joined from north and south by the P\u00e1mb\u00e1r and V\u00e1ni\u00e1r, minor streams. The Sanathkumaranadi traverses\nHos\u00far and Dharmapuri, in the latter t\u00e1luk, near Marandahalli, being tapped with profit to r\u00e1yats and Government. The fertility of the At\u00far t\u00e1luk is chiefly due to the Vasishtanadi and Swethanadi, which flow eastward into South Arcot. There are, besides these, numerous tributaries of the K\u00e1veri. A small traffic is carried on the K\u00e1veri in basket boats, and timber is occasionally floated down. The water of these rivers is utilized either by anicuts thrown across their beds, or by channels which tap the banks. The channel system is very extensively worked in the Paramathi division of the N\u00e1makal t\u00e1luk. The fisheries of the District, although they make a considerable total, are individually insignificant, consisting of the right of fishing in the different Government tanks, which is purchased for sums varying from 10s. to more than \u00a320.\n\nThe District forests are of considerable value, but there is some reason to fear that they have been overworked, with a view to immediate profit rather than ultimate revenue. The forests, situated for the most part on the hills or in the valleys formed by them, cover an area of more than 2000 square miles. There is a considerable amount of evergreen forest on the summit of the higher ranges; and on the outer slopes of most of the hills there is a fair amount of deciduous forest, with many valuable varieties of trees. The Jev\u00e1di and Yelagiri hills contain some valuable timber, and a large portion of the Shevaroys is clothed with middling-sized jungle. Sandal-wood is found. The most valuable forest is the belt of vengai (Pterocarpus Marsupium) on the hilly tracts which fringe the K\u00e1veri in the south of the Hos\u00far t\u00e1luk and towards Pennagaram. Reserves and plantations have been formed for the supply of fuel to the railway, but at the present stage the experiment is not sufficiently advanced to admit of an accurate estimate being formed of its utility. Jungle produce, such as honey, beeswax, bark for tanning and dyeing, soap-nut, fibres, medicinal roots, etc., are collected by the Malay\u00e1lis and other jungle tribes; in some cases this right is rented out. Lac is found in the Hos\u00far jungles, and both in the hills and on the plains the tamarind is a considerable source of revenue.\n\nWild animals are daily diminishing in numbers, as each hillman carries a gun and shoots for food everything that comes in his way, regardless of sex, age, or season of the year. Bison and even elephants are occasionally seen on the Jev\u00e1dis. Leopards and bears are to be found in most of the hilly tracts. S\u00e1mbhar deer may be found towards Pennagaram, and in a few places in the Hos\u00far t\u00e1luk. Hy\u00e6nas, antelope, deer of several kinds, wild hog, a species of armadillo, and a few wolves complete the catalogue. Pea and jungle fowl, duck, teal, snipe, florican, etc., can be had in season.\n\nThe geology has been only partially examined. The formation is\nmostly gneissic, granite and trap dikes cropping up occasionally. The principal varieties of rock belonging to the gneiss which occur in the eastern part are, in the order of their importance and extent of development\u2014(1) Hornblendic schists and rocks; (2) Quartzo-felspathic gneiss, massive or schistose; (3) Talcose and chloritic rocks (generally schistose, rarely massive); (4) Magnetic iron beds; (5) Crystalline limestones. Magnesite veins occur chiefly at the Chalk hills (so miscalled) near the foot of the Shevaroys. Pot-stone is found in several places. *(Vide Vol. iv., Part 2, Mem. Geo. Surv. of India.)* Magnetic iron occurs in practically inexhaustible quantities. Corundum and chromate of iron are also obtainable. The washings of some rivers yield gold, notably the Penner (more correctly Ponni\u00e1r, so named on account of its golden sands). It is probable that gold may exist in the Hos\u00far taluk, where it borders on Mysore. There is no coal. Lime is available in sufficient quantities to serve as a flux in iron-smelting.\n\n**History.**\u2014The ancient history of the northern and southern parts of Salem District must be treated separately, as they formed parts of different kingdoms. The northern part was included in the kingdom of the Pallavas, who flourished in the fifth century A.D., and apparently long before, at their capital Conjevaram. When the Pallavas were finally overthrown by the Chola kings of Tanjore, in the ninth century A.D., this part of the country was the only portion remaining to them of their once extensive kingdom. The Pallavas were the excavators of the monolithic \u2018Rathas\u2019 at the Seven Pagodas, which fact points to the early supremacy of the dynasty. The Buddhist tope at Amravati may also be attributed to this dynasty. The boundaries of their kingdom, when at its zenith, probably extended from the Narbad\u00e1 and the borders of Orissa on the north to the southern Penner on the south; and on the west from the northern extremity of the Western Gh\u00e1ts to the Bay of Bengal on the east.\n\nThe southern portions of Salem originally formed part of the ancient kingdom of Conga. This kingdom was confined within the limits of the present Districts of Salem and Coimbatore. A Tamil manuscript with the title of *Conga-desha R\u00e1j\u00e1kkal*, or the \u2018Chronicle of the Kings of the Conga Country,\u2019 professes to give their history from about the commencement of the Christian era down to the beginning of the seventeenth century. The kings enumerated belong to two dynasties, the earlier line being of the Solar, and the later line of the Gang\u00e1 race. The Solar race began with seven kings of the Ratha tribe, the name of the first being V\u00edra Raya Chakravarti. The capital during this period was Skand\u00e1pura. Conga, including the south of the modern District of Salem, was a seat of the manufacture of the finest steel from a very early age. It has been conjectured that the\nancient Egyptians used Indian steel for the tools with which they carved their hieroglyphs on obelisks and temples. It is recorded that when Alexander the Great was in India, Porus made a present of steel to him.\n\nUnder the second or Gang\u00e1 dynasty the limits of the kingdom were greatly extended towards the north-west. The list of these kings given in the chronicles agrees, with very few variations, with the pedigree compiled from their published land-grants. The cause of the extinction of the earlier dynasty is not recorded; but probably the last Solar king lost his life in an attack on the Gang\u00e1 chieftain of southern Mysore, who followed up his advantage by seizing the vacant throne of Conga. The third king of the Gang\u00e1 dynasty, Hari Varm\u00e1, removed the capital from Skandapura to Talk\u00e1d about 290 A.D.\n\nThe second period of the ancient history of Salem extends from the conquest of Conga by the Cholas, down to the rise of the Ball\u00e1la kings of Karnata, a period of about two centuries. The Ball\u00e1la kings may be regarded as the rulers of the kingdom from about 1069 A.D. Eight kings of this line ruled over Karnata, which included Salem. The latter District then became tributary to the kings of Vijayanagar about 1350, and continued to form part of their empire till their overthrow in 1565. Even after this downfall, all the southern portion of Vijayanagar was left in the hands of the old kings, forming still a very extensive dominion.\n\nAbout the beginning of the seventeenth century Salem became a dependency of Madura. It was visited and mentioned by Robert de Nobilis in 1623. During the next century, Salem comes into prominence in connection with Haidar Al\u00ed\u2019s wars, many of the operations being conducted within the present District. In 1760, Haidar seized the B\u00e1ramah\u00e1l, and made it a rallying point for his troops on their way to the war in Arcot. In 1767, the English, Niz\u00e1m Al\u00ed, and the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, jointly attacked Haidar, and an English force attempted the reduction of the B\u00e1ramah\u00e1l, but without success. Niz\u00e1m Al\u00ed then deserted the English and went over to Haidar. After a period of desultory warfare, confined chiefly to the B\u00e1ramah\u00e1l, Niz\u00e1m Al\u00ed made overtures of peace to the English, and by a treaty in 1768 joined them, again abandoning Haidar. During this period the English captured in rapid succession most of the fortified places of Salem and Coimbatore Districts. Subsequently, Colonel Wood, who was in command of the English force, met with a series of reverses; and was superseded by Colonel Lang. This, however, did not prevent Haidar from retaking all the places previously captured by the English, and finally peace was concluded in 1769.\n\nWar broke out again with Haidar in 1780, and continued after his\ndeath in 1782. Peace was concluded with his son Tip\u00fa in 1784. This only lasted till 1790, when war again broke out, chiefly owing to Tip\u00fa's attack on Travancore. An English force under Colonel Kelly invaded the B\u00e1ramah\u00e1l, which by the next year was almost completely in the hands of the English. The remaining operations, which were not connected with this part of the country, terminated in the treaty of 1792, by which, among other cessions, the whole of the present District of Salem (except the Hos\u00far taluk) comprising what was known as the Tal\u00e1gh\u00e1t and B\u00e1ramah\u00e1l, fell to the English. After the final defeat and death of Tip\u00fa in 1799, the Hos\u00far taluk, known as the B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t, also came into the possession of the English under the provisions of the Partition Treaty of Mysore.\n\nThe District of Salem, as at present composed, contains 9 taluks; of which two are directly under the Collector, three under the Sub-Collector, two form the Head Assistant's charge, and two the charge of the general Deputy Collector. Its limits are now identical with those of 1799, except that the Kangundi zamind\u00e1ri, north of the P\u00e1l\u00e1r, was finally transferred to North Arcot in 1808.\n\nAdministrative History. \u2014 Immediately on the acquisition of the Tal\u00e1gh\u00e1t and B\u00e1ramah\u00e1l, Colonel (then Captain) Read was placed in charge, with Captains Graham, MacLeod, and Munro (afterwards Governor of Madras) as his assistants. He at once addressed himself to the survey of the District, and to the introduction of a uniform revenue system, which was fairly launched throughout this portion of the District in 1796, as a r\u00e1yatw\u00e1ri system to be confirmed for ever. This, however, met with no favour at head-quarters, where the idea of leases on the zamind\u00e1ri system had been resolved on. The zamind\u00e1ri system was formerly unknown in Salem, but the Government ordered it to be introduced. In 1799, Read, with Munro as his secretary, followed the tide of war into Mysore, and never returned to the District. A new administrator succeeded them, and so faithfully carried out orders, that by 1805 the zamind\u00e1ri system was in full force everywhere, except in the B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t, which escaped owing to its being a recent acquisition, and, after being leased out for two years to two natives, was finally surveyed in 1804, since which time it has prospered. Great losses followed on the overthrow of Read's settlement. The 205 estates paying 16 l\u00e1khs of rupees (say \u00a3160,000) in 1805 had by 1821 been so reduced in value that they only paid 8 l\u00e1khs, which in 1836 fell to 5 l\u00e1khs, and in 1850 to 4\u00bd l\u00e1khs, or say \u00a345,000.\n\nVarious causes, into which it is needless to enter here, were at work to bring about this result; and a series of remedies, unsuccessful because they did not go to the root of the mischief, were tried. Of one thing, however, there can be no doubt, viz. that notwith-\nstanding all Read\u2019s care and zeal, he had in many cases over-assessed the soil. The zamindars had, before 1813, to some extent given satisfactory evidence that this was so, by reducing rates on \u2018wet\u2019 lands throughout by one-sixth, and on \u2018dry\u2019 land from one-eighth to one-fifth. The end soon came. Before the zamindari system had been in existence for five years, those in authority began to hesitate. Their first step in retreat from the false position which had been taken up was made in 1809, when, failing bidders for estates sold for arrears, the Collector was empowered to bring them under his own management, a policy extended in 1813 by permission to buy in such estates at auction on behalf of Government. This politic step was afterwards modified by a restriction of the bid to the amount of the arrears.\n\nOn such estates coming under Government management, the District officers had opportunities for more closely studying the causes which led their owners into bankruptcy, consequent on which the conviction became fixed that, to insure stability of revenue, a reduction in the demand was needed. This, however, was only done in a hesitating and partial manner. Thus, in 1816, the assessment in the southern part of the District was reduced generally by 10 per cent.; and in 1818, the Collector was empowered to make a discretional reduction not exceeding 30 per cent. These benefits touched the r\u0101yatw\u0101r\u012b lands only, and rightly so; for, apart from the fact that a reversion to the State as the direct landlord is the most important factor in securing prosperity to the tenantry of the District, the zamindars were even on equitable, much less on legal, grounds entitled to no consideration whatever, as, in fixing the peshkash (revenue) payable by them, the cultivated land alone had been taken into account, all the waste being made over free and for ever. In the present day it is hard, with telegraphic communication, and Salem within half a night\u2019s journey from Madras, to realize the darkness in which the authorities formerly were as to the state of the District. Even Munro, when Governor of Madras, than whom no one then living took more interest in the District, was ignorant of important changes which had been introduced into the revenue system.\n\nThe one thing plainly perceptible to the Madras authorities was that the revenue was diminishing and uncertain; the causes were unknown, or if known, wrong deductions were drawn from the facts. To stimulate the extension of cultivation, the suicidal panacea of the kaul tenure was resorted to in 1822. Kaul, ordinarily signifying an agreement of any kind, in the sense in which it is here used, indicates a tenancy under which the r\u0101yat, on taking up fresh lands, pays no assessment for the first year, half rates for the second, and full rates for the third year. The terms of the tenancy may vary from this, but the principle is the same. The result was a foregone conclusion.\nR\u00e1yats already holding over-assessed or fully-assessed lands snapped greedily at the bait, and for the first two years or more, as the case might be, all went on prosperously; but in the year when Government should have reaped the full benefit of their concession, the riyats turned round and relinquished their new holdings. Many were the recipes devised to avert the necessary consequence of the measure. The kaul tenure was prohibited unless the patt\u00e1 land was retained; the riyats should only resign good and bad lands in equal proportions, and might not cling to the one and despise the other. The system was doomed from its birth, and received its death-blow in 1850. As regards the over-assessed lands, the percentage reductions of 1816 to 1818, above referred to, affected the whole tract rateably, but had no operation towards effecting a reduction in cases where individual fields or holdings were over-taxed. Further reductions, but still only in the nature of a percentage reduction, were made in 1858 and 1859, and in respect of garden lands in 1864. But it was not until 1869 to 1874, when the new settlement now in force was introduced, that the Government demand was universally fixed on equitable and scientific principles. Under this revision, the area under cultivation has risen from 1,050,000 acres, assessed at \u00a3173,000, to 1,667,459 acres, assessed at \u00a3219,629.\n\nTenures.\u2014The District contains three p\u00e1laiyams or zamind\u00e1r\u00eds of importance,\u2014Sulagiri, B\u00e1gal\u00far, and Berik\u00e1i, all in the Hos\u00far t\u00e1luk. There are also 148 mitt\u00e1s and a few j\u00e1girs. But the predominant tenure is r\u00e1yatw\u00e1ri, the tenant being liable to ejectment by the Government only in case of failure to pay his revenue. Every year he has the option of throwing up his holding or any field in it, and his assessment is fixed for thirty years. A mitt\u00e1d\u00e1r has the right of collecting the paim\u00e1ish tirvai or settled rent, a share of which he pays to Government as peshkash. The tenure cannot be reconverted into r\u00e1yatw\u00e1ri. If the mitt\u00e1d\u00e1r is in arrears, his right to collect the tirvai can be sold by Government, which does not itself enter the market as a buyer. The mitt\u00e1d\u00e1rs are addicted to leasing their villages, often selling them in shares, and the lessees again sub-letting; the Hindu system of undivided families multiplies the mitt\u00e1d\u00e1rs, their middlemen, etc.; the latter and the sub-lessees often get into debt, their rights in the villages being sold by the civil courts; Musalm\u00e1n inheritance so works in a couple of generations as to produce, instead of one original mitt\u00e1d\u00e1r, twenty or thirty such, all owning different shares in the village, according to sex and relationship;\u2014these and other causes all combined often render the r\u00e1yat uncertain as to who his landlord is. Perhaps two or three persons will at one and the same time, under colourable rights, distrain or attempt to distrain his property. For these reasons, the position of the r\u00e1yat in mitt\u00e1 villages is unenviable.\nAdded to this, he neither shares in the equitable revision of assessment which takes place in Government lands each thirty years, nor in the annual jam\u00e1bandi remissions, granted by Government when drought, flood, excess of rain, blight, or other accidents impoverish their tenants. If the decision of the civil courts is rightly interpreted to mean that r\u00e1yats in mitt\u00eds are liable to ejectment from year to year, this is not known to the landlords, or if they know it, they do not act on it.\n\n**Population.**\u2014In 1800, the population was returned at 612,871; in 1835, at 905,190; in 1850, at 1,195,367. Since that time, quinquennial Censuses have been taken; and in 1871, the first regular Census showed a population of 1,966,995, or an average of 5 persons to each house. The last Census, taken on the 17th February 1881, disclosed a total population of 1,599,595; so that in the decade since 1871 there was a decrease of 367,400, or nearly 19 per cent., due to the famine of 1876\u201378, when Salem was one of the Districts in which the distress was most severely felt. The pressure was felt in every t\u00e1luk, but the centre of distress was in the B\u00e1lagh\u00e1t, Hos\u00far t\u00e1luk alone losing 31.74 per cent. of its inhabitants. Krishnagiri, Dharmapuri, and Uttankarai t\u00e1luks lost between 28 and 29 per cent.\n\nThe results of the Census of 1881 may be summarized as follows:\u2014Area of District, 7653 square miles, distributed into 9 t\u00e1luks or Sub-divisions. Classified according to sex, there were \u2014 males 778,483, and females 821,112. Classified according to age\u2014under 15 years, boys 301,383, and girls 306,138; total children, 607,521, or 37.9 per cent. of the population: 15 years and upwards, males 477,025, and females 514,897; total adults, 991,922, or 62.1 per cent. of the population: persons of unstated age, 152.\n\nThe density of population was 209 persons per square mile, as compared with 257 in 1871. In point of density, Salem ranks as the fourteenth District in Madras Presidency. Number of towns, 14; of villages, 3958; occupied houses, 311,393; unoccupied houses, 33,009. Towns and villages per square mile, 0.519; occupied houses per square mile, 41; persons per occupied house, 5.1.\n\nAccording to religion, Hindus numbered 1,531,855, or 95.77 per cent. of the total population; Muhammadans, 51,092, or 3.19 per cent.; Christians, 16,567, or 1.04 per cent.; Buddhists, 18; Jains, 46; and \u2018others,\u2019 17. The majority of the Hindus, in the proportion of 2 to 1, professed the Sivaite as opposed to the Vishnuite faith; the other sects are only fractionally represented. The Sivaites numbered 998,853, and the Vishnuites 506,945. The Hindus were sub-divided according to caste as follows:\u2014Br\u00e1hmans (priests), 28,393; Kshattriyas (warrior caste), 3175; Shetties (traders), 22,512; Vell\u00e1lars (agriculturists), 376,221; Idaiy\u00e1rs (shepherds), 57,530; Kamm\u00e1lars (artisans),\n43,343; Kanakkans (writers), 2529; Kaikalars (weavers), 77,994; Vanni\u00e1ns (labourers), 391,287; Kushavans (potters), 11,949; Sat\u00e1nis (mixed castes), 40,335; Shembadavans (fishermen), 14,950; Shanans (toddy-drawers), 45,157; Ambattans (barbers), 17,086; Vanans (washerwomen), 20,142; Pariahs (out-castes), 211,856; and \u2018others,\u2019 167,396.\n\nThe Muhammadan population by race, as distinguished from descendants of converts, consisted of\u2014Labbays, 5409; Arabs, 9; Mughals, 27; Mappilas, 5; Path\u00e1ns, 945; Sayyids, 1187; Shaikhs, 4532; and \u2018others,\u2019 38,978. According to sect, the Muhammadans were returned\u2014Sunnis, 41,916; Shi\u00e1s, 879; W\u00e1hab\u00eds, 8; and \u2018others,\u2019 8289.\n\nThe Christian population included\u2014British born subjects, 80; other British subjects (not British born), 74; and other Europeans or Americans, 26. Eurasians numbered 445; native Christians, 15,782; and \u2018others,\u2019 160. Adopting another method of classification, there were\u2014Roman Catholics, 14,172, of whom 13,856 were native converts; Protestants, 707; and \u2018other Christian sects,\u2019 1688. Since 1871, the Christian population has increased by 214 per cent.\n\nAs regards occupation, the Census distributed the male population into six main groups:\u2014(1) Professional class, including State officials of every kind, 15,187; (2) domestic servants, inn and lodging keepers, 4492; (3) commercial class, including bankers, merchants, carriers, etc., 9611; (4) agricultural and pastoral class, 390,430; (5) industrial class, including all manufacturers and artisans, 99,858; and (6) indefinite and non-productive class, comprising general labourers, male children, and persons of unspecified occupation, 258,905.\n\nEmigration is not considerable, but a few coolies go to Ceylon, the French colonies, and Burma. Large numbers seek work in the neighbouring Districts. Those who go beyond the adjoining Districts do not take their women. The balance of emigrants and immigrants, according to the Census returns, leaves a gain to Salem of about 6000.\n\nOf the 3972 towns and villages in 1881, 1957 contained less than two hundred inhabitants; 1180 from two to five hundred; 512 from five hundred to one thousand; 225 from one to two thousand; 63 from two to three thousand; 22 from three to five thousand; 9 from five to ten thousand; 2 from ten to fifteen thousand; 1 from fifteen to twenty thousand; and 1 more than fifty thousand.\n\nSalem, the chief town, is situated on the Tirumanimutt\u00e1r, about 6 miles from the foot of the Shevaroys. It is a municipality, with a population (1881) of 50,667, and a revenue of \u00a33592 in 1883\u201384. The following are the other towns:\u2014Vaniyambadi (15,426); Tirupatur (14,278); Shendamangalam (12,575); Krishnagiri (8856); Atur (8334); Rasipur (7969); Dharmapuri (7090); Ammapet (7003);\nTiruchengod (5889); Hosur (5869); Namakal (5147); Thatha-\nyangarpet (4591); Edapadi (3942).\n\nReading-rooms or literary associations have been established at\nSalem, Yercaud (Yerk\u00e1d), Hos\u00far, and Tirupat\u00far, and all other principal\ntowns. The chief source of charity is the Thopur Chatram Fund,\nfrom which sar\u00e1sis (native inns), etc. are being provided all over the\nDistrict. Those at Salem, Thopur, Jollarp\u00e9t, At\u00far, and Tirupat\u00far are\namong the best. Besides the hospital and dispensary at head-\nquarters, there are 11 dispensaries scattered over the District, and\nscarcely a large village is without its own cleaning and sanitary staff.\nSalem contains no shrine to compare in magnificence with those of\nMadura, Tanjore, or Sr\u00edrangam; but pilgrims crowd to the sacred\nsprings on the T\u00edrthamalai, to Hanumat\u00edrtham on the Penner, to\nthe pagoda at Hos\u00far, to the Adipadinettu at the falls of the K\u00e1veri\n(Cauvery), and to the festivals at Dharmapuri, Mecheri, Tiruchengod,\nNamakal, and other places. The chief shrines where the Malay\u00e1lis\nworship are on the Shevaroys and the Chitterimalai hills near Har\u00far.\nThere are printing presses in the Collector\u2019s office and in the central\njail. A private press, called the Patriot Press, publishes a local news-\npaper in vernacular bi-monthly.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Of the total area of the District, about 4,020,377 acres\nare occupied by Government villages, inclusive of in\u00e1ms, the remainder\nbeing in mitt\u00e1 or p\u00e1layam villages. The total number of villages in the\nDistrict is 3958, with 4722 hamlets, excluding those uninhabited, which\nnumber 745 and 623 respectively. According to the last quinquennial\nreturn, the cultivable area belonging to Government, exclusive of land\nreserved for public purposes, was 1,667,459 acres, assessed at \u00a3219,629.\nHoldings occupied 1,014,316 acres, assessed at \u00a3159,801. The number\nof registered r\u00e1yats was 245,484, with 47,477 sub-tenants, making a\ntotal of 292,961. The pattas numbered 161,870, of which 102,116\nwere single and 59,754 joint.\n\nThe staple crops are rice and rag\u00ed (Eleusine corocana), the latter\nbeing almost exclusively the food of the labouring class. The yield is\nassumed, for purposes of assessment, to be 641 Madras measures of\npaddy or unhusked rice, and 347 Madras measures of the other three\nstaples for the Tal\u00e1gh\u00e1t t\u00e1luk, the out-turn in the B\u00e1ramah\u00e1l and\nB\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t t\u00e1luk being the same for paddy, but somewhat less on the\naverage for dry grains. Rag\u00ed grows to perfection in the B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t, and\nabove the average in the B\u00e1ramah\u00e1l. Kambu or spiked millet (Pennisetum typhoideum) is about the same as in the Tal\u00e1gh\u00e1t; but gram,\nthough remarkably fine, is an uncertain crop, and yields little more\nthan half as much as the other staple grains. In 1883\u201384, cereals and\nmillets occupied 935,795 acres; pulses, 218,299 acres; orchard and\ngarden produce, 8225 acres; drugs and narcotics, 8639 acres; condi-\nments and spices, 11,182 acres; starches, 426 acres; sugars, 2864 acres; oil-seeds, 74,553 acres; indigo, 2538 acres; fibres, 20,669, of which 18,692 were under cotton: total, 1,283,190 acres.\n\nThe greater portion (82 per cent.) of the classified area of the District consists of red soil, the regar or black cotton-soil occupying 16 per cent. (in the northern taluks, 20 per cent.), and exceptional or permanently improved land, 2 per cent. A pair of oxen could manage a farm of 3 acres of 'dry,' but not more than an acre of 'wet' land. 'Wet' land is almost invariably ploughed by four, five, or six pairs of oxen working together in the field. If the owner has not enough of cattle of his own, he must hire or borrow them. On a holding of 2 acres of 'wet' and 3 acres of 'dry' land, the net profit in a fair year would not probably exceed \u00a36 per annum, or about 10s. a month. The position of the poorer cultivators may be gauged from the fact that they will desert their farms in numbers if a wage of 8s. a month is not assured them. The majority of the peasantry are in debt. The habit of indebtedness is so ingrained in their nature, that if they all started fair to-morrow, 50 per cent. would be in debt again in a year.\n\nOne man is held to be sufficient for the ordinary daily labour on a farm of 3 acres of 'wet,' or 6 acres of 'dry' land, if assisted in the heavy work of planting, weeding, reaping, and threshing. His wages would be 480 measures of grain per annum = \u00a31, 5s., plus an annual money payment of 6s. (the wages in the northern being lower than in the southern taluks). Twenty-seven measures of seed are required for an acre of 'wet,' and 6 measures for an acre of 'dry' land. Irrigated crops are weeded twice if sown broadcast, but once only if transplanted, 'Dry' crops are weeded only once. Manuring is applied, as a rule, by treading in leaves on 'wet,' and penning out sheep on 'dry' land. For 'wet' lands, the average is 120 bundles of wild indigo or other leaves per acre, and this is supplied annually to all fields thought worth manuring. Eight pens of 200 sheep each, at a cost of 4 measures of grain per diem, is the usual allowance per acre for 'dry' lands. The implements said to be required for a farm of 3 acres of irrigated or 6 acres of 'dry' land are a plough, a mamuty, an axe and chopper, three small weeding hoes, and three sickles. The highest Government 'wet' rate in the District is \u00a31, 8s. per acre, and the lowest is \u00a31, 3s. 1\u00bdd., exclusive of local cesses, the highest for 'dry' lands being 10s., and the lowest 6d. The cost of cultivating an acre of good black loam is about 18s. on irrigated, and 7s. 6d. on unirrigated lands in the northern taluks, the rates in the Tal\u00e1gh\u00e1t being somewhat higher, or 18s. 6d. and 9s. 6d. respectively.\n\nThe normal rates of wages for unskilled labour are\u2014for men, 3\u00bdd.; for women, 2\u00bcd.; for children (male or female), 1\u00bcd. The Wadder\nor navvy caste get twice as much, but they generally do taskwork, by which they gain more than by daily wages. The wages of a working goldsmith vary with the value of the materials, but may be taken on an average at 1s. per diem. A blacksmith gets 1s.; a carpenter from 1s. to 1s. 3d.; bricklayers from 9d. to 1s. 3d. The rates of wages of unskilled labour in 1883-84 varied from 3\u00bdd. in towns to 2\u00bdd. per diem in villages; and of skilled labour from 1s. 1\u00bdd. in towns to 9d. a day in villages.\n\nDuring the ten years ending 1874, the prices at Salem town per garce of 9360 lbs. avoirdupois, in February and March, when the r\u0101yats sell, averaged \u00a310, 6s. for rice, and \u00a311, 10s. for cholam or great millet (Sorghum vulgare). The price of produce at the end of 1883-84, per maund of 80 lbs., was\u2014rice, 5s. 0\u00bdd.; ragi (Eleusine corocana), 2s. 1d.; cholam, 2s. 5\u00bdd.; kambu, 2s. 2\u00bdd.; varagu (Panicum miliaceum), 2s.; wheat, 6s. 6\u00bed.; gram, 4s. 0\u00bed.; salt, 6s. 0\u00bdd.; sugar, 7s. 1d.; cotton, 16s. In 1883-84, the live stock and implements of agriculture were\u2014buffaloes, 43,674; bullocks, 191,541; cows, 273,137; asses, 4770; goats, 293,895; sheep, 412,692; horses, 450; mules, 13; ponies, 1868; pigs, 15,904; carts, 8893; and ploughs, 108,653.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014In May 1872, and again in May 1874, the District suffered from cyclones which, though they did not, owing to absence of cultivation in those months, do much damage to crops, caused terrible mortality among cattle, and breached several tanks. In the autumn of 1874, heavy floods occurred, notably in the P\u00e1l\u00e1r and the basin between the P\u00e1l\u00e1r and the Yelagiri hills. Many tanks were breached, and much property was damaged. The railway line was destroyed in several places, and a considerable portion of the town of V\u00e1n\u00edamb\u00e1di was swept away. The excessive north-west monsoon of 1877 drowned the crops. In 1878, another great fall of rain fell east of the Mukan\u00e1rmalai, and washed away the railway embankment. The cyclone of November 1880 played havoc in the At\u00far t\u00e1luk. Every anicut was washed away, as also the large bridge on the trunk road near Thalaiv\u00e1sal; some 20 tanks were breached and many houses destroyed. The flood came in the day-time, and only six lives were lost. The damage done was estimated at \u00a35000.\n\nBlightes are not uncommon in Salem, and locusts, caterpillars, and other insects devour the crops. The P\u00e1l\u00e1r, when in flood, occasionally causes loss to the river-side landholders; and breached tanks, especially when a chain of tanks gives way together, cause damage, but more generally to property than to life.\n\nThe severest famine of early years was that of 1833, when prices rose 71 per cent.; 1845-46 was a year of high prices, as also was 1857-58. In the famine of 1866, the following prices were reached between September and December:\u2014Rice, 15s. to 17s. 6d. per cwt.;\ncholam, 8s. 6d. to 12s. per cwt. Works and relief houses were provided by Government for the needy.\n\nBut this and all previous famines on record are dwarfed by the terrible calamity of 1876-78. There had been signs and warnings by which this might have been foreseen. The north-east monsoon failed both in 1873 and 1874. In 1875, the north-east monsoon was almost a total failure, especially the latter part of it; and in 1876, the southwest and north-east monsoons, on both of which the District depends for its water-supply, failed almost completely. The pinch began to be felt in October 1876, but people still hoped. By November, the failure of the monsoon became an established fact; grain dealers took alarm, and prices rose at a bound. In August 1877, inferior rice had risen to a rupee (2s.) for 11 lbs., and other grains when procurable were nearly the same price: as in ordinary years the price is from 20 lbs. to 30 lbs. for a rupee, the keen distress may be realized. During the first thirteen months of famine the mortality was 180,000, the average death-rate in other years being 50,000. It is estimated that altogether the District lost 10 per cent. of its population. Distress may be said to set in when normal prices are doubled, any rise beyond that rate involving famine.\n\nOne result of the late famine was to call attention to the neglected means of storing water. The P\u00e1l\u00e1r and K\u00e1veri (Cauvery) might be utilized to a far greater extent than at present, and the Penner (Ponniy\u00e1r) carries untold wealth into the Bay of Bengal. In so far as the increased wealth of the population gives them more reserve to draw upon in time of scarcity, improved irrigation might do much for the District; but it cannot render certain a capricious rainfall, on which the majority of the tanks depend, and it cannot secure grass for cattle. The neglect of forestry is probably responsible for much. In the middle of the 16th century, the whole District was more or less a forest; it is not now easy in many places to find shade for a noon-day halt. Were it not for the railway, this last famine would probably have carried off a half of the population, instead of the 204,590 who perished from insufficient food, and the subsequent diseases consequent thereon.\n\nIndustries and Trade.\u2014The chief industry of the District is weaving, which is carried on in almost every large town or village. The weavers of Salem and R\u00e1zipur are especially noted. Carpets of great beauty and superior workmanship are made in the Salem jail. Good iron and steel are made, but only on a small scale; an attempt to utilize the mineral wealth of the District by European capital having failed owing to the cost of charcoal. In Salem town there are several cutlers whose wares are famed for temper and finish throughout India. Sugar, cotton, hides, indigo, saltpetre, salt, grains, areca-nut, coir,\njungle produce, coffee, clothes, etc., pass freely in and out of the District, but there is no trustworthy information regarding the value of imports and exports.\n\nCommunications.\u2014There are about 1633 miles of road in the District, on which the expenditure in 1883\u201384 was \u00a313,656; but the state of the roads is not good. The south-west line of the Madras Railway runs for a distance of 131 miles within the District. The principal hill passes are\u2014the Chengama Pass, by which South Arcot is reached from Sing\u00e1rapet; the Mor\u00farpatti gh\u00e1t, which lies between the Shevaroys and the Thopur Hills; the Thopur and Mukan\u00far gh\u00e1t, through which traffic reaches Dharmapuri from the south-east and east; the R\u00e1yakottai Pass, which gives access from Krishnagiri to the B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t; the Manjanadi and Kott\u00e1ipatti Passes, by which Uttankarai is accessible from Salem and At\u00far respectively, on the south; the Anchittai gh\u00e1t, almost impracticable, by which the B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t portion of the Hos\u00far t\u00e1luk communicates with the valley of the K\u00e1veri.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The imperial revenue of the District for 1883\u201384 was \u00a3261,292, of which land revenue contributed \u00a3212,051. Excise came next with \u00a330,388; and stamps, \u00a316,271. The other items of receipt are small, the forests being credited with only \u00a39880. The total revenue in 1805\u201306 is returned at \u00a3191,786, of which the land yielded \u00a3182,348; in 1850\u201351 the total revenue was \u00a3196,693, and the land revenue \u00a3177,535; in 1870\u201371 the total revenue was \u00a3302,091, and the land revenue \u00a3232,191.\n\nThere are at present 36 magistrates\u2019 courts and 10 civil courts, including those of the revenue officers, covenanted and uncovenanted, empowered to hear rent suits. The number of covenanted officers is 5, including the Assistant Collector, who has no separate charge. Exclusive of village watchmen, the District police in 1883\u201384 consisted of 2 officers, 18 inspectors, and 1032 constables, or 1 policeman to every 7'24 square miles and every 1549 of the population. A special police, raised to control the spirit of outrage which was evidenced by the Salem riots, consisted of 1 inspector and 202 constables. It is not likely to be permanently retained. The District has 1 central and 17 subsidiary jails, containing (in 1883\u201384) 5113 prisoners, and costing \u00a34266.\n\nThe education of the masses is chiefly got at the payal schools, where elementary teaching is given after a time-honoured but unscientific fashion. In 1871, according to Census returns, there were only 190 schools in the District; but this cannot be supposed to include the payal schools. The Local Fund Act, passed in 1871, gave a stimulus to popular education by providing the funds for its extension; and in 1883\u201384 there were 511 schools, either belonging to Government or aided, which were attended by 9368 pupils. In the returns furnished\nfor the first edition of this work, it was estimated that about 7200 children receive elementary education from unaided payal schools. The Census Report of 1881 returned 18,032 boys and 1091 girls as under instruction, besides 50,349 males and 2857 females able to read and write, but not under instruction. Regarding missionary effort, the field is divided between the London Mission, the French priests under the Vicar-Apostolic of Pondicherri, and, to a small extent, the Lutheran Evangelistic Mission. The Roman Catholics outnumber the rest.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The average monthly rainfall for 22 years ending 1881, as registered at Salem town, was as follows:\u2014January, 0\u00b736 inch; February 0\u00b709 inch; March, 0\u00b785 inch; April, 2\u00b717 inches; May, 4\u00b734 inches; June, 3\u00b715 inches; July, 3\u00b789 inches; August, 5\u00b726 inches; September, 6\u00b715 inches; October, 6\u00b794 inches; November, 2\u00b726 inches; and December, 0\u00b762 inch: yearly average, 36\u00b708 inches. The average mean temperature for 12 years ending 1881 was 80\u00b76\u00b0 F., ranging from 75\u00b73\u00b0 F. in December to 86\u00b78\u00b0 F. in April. On the lower hill ranges, fever prevails for a great part of the year. Strangers, especially if they drink the water, are most liable to attack, though the anaemic faces and enlarged spleens of the acclimatized population show that they have by no means an immunity from the scourge. In the plains, during the rainy season, large tracts are liable to a peculiarly weakening sort of fever, which in some years causes considerable mortality. The cause of this is not exactly known, as the fever does not always appear under given conditions; and occasionally one particular locality, noted for fever, may be free, while another, reputed for healthiness, may become the scene of an epidemic. Cholera rages through the District at times. The virulence of the disease may be estimated from one example. In 1875, in the village of Kanakampatti, in three days 52 died out of a population of 200. The deaths from cholera, in 1875\u201376, were 15,487; in 1876\u201377, 45,162; and in 1877, from July to November, 8002. The last outbreak in 1883 was attended with a loss of 5015 lives. Small-pox has to a great extent been stamped out, though during the famine, when the population was peculiarly predisposed to disease, exceptional mortality occurred. Dengue was prevalent in the latter part of 1872. Leprosy is not common. Cattle disease is rarely absent, rinderpest and foot-and-mouth disease being the most common forms.

Area, 1072 square miles. Population (1881) 327,178, namely, males 159,902, and females 167,276; occupying 61,612 houses, in 3 towns and 488 villages. Hindus number 314,101; Muhammadans, 7313; Christians, 5739; and 'others,' 25. The taluk is very diversified in aspect, containing hill and dale, untilled tracts and prosperous cultivation. Among the products of the taluk, mention should be made of coffee, tea, and indigo. The great mass of the agricultural classes are poor. The trading classes are somewhat better off. Weaving is carried on to a great extent; but the weaver class suffered cruelly in the famine of 1876-78. Jewellers, cloth merchants, and grain merchants drive a good trade. The south-west line of Madras Railway traverses the taluk. In 1883 the taluk contained 2 civil and 4 criminal courts; police circles (thaniis), 19; regular police, 355. Land revenue, \u00a340,347.\n\nSalem (Selam).\u2014Chief town of Salem District, Madras, and a municipality, with the courts of the District Judge, Magistrate, and munsif, a central jail, 2 churches, memorial hall, schools, hospital, etc. Lat. $11^\\circ 39' 16''$ N., long. $78^\\circ 11' 47''$ E. Population (1881) 50,667, namely, males 24,584, and females 26,083. Hindus number 44,614; Muhammadans, 4669; Christians, 1382; and 'others,' 2. Nearly 90 per cent. of the population are Hindus. The town is straggling and extensive, being about three miles long and two broad. The river Tirumani-mutar divides the native town into two quarters. The Europeans live in a suburb named Hastampatti. The railway station lies in another suburb, Suramangalam, 3\u00bd miles distant. On the eastern side is Salem proper, where most of the merchants and officials live; on the south is Gugai, the weaving quarter. The western side comprises the fort (now no longer existing) and Shevapett, the latter named from a fair held there on Thursdays. Adjacent to the fort are most of the public buildings. The mahal in the fort was originally the palace or residence of one of the tributary chiefs of Salem. Salem is a busy trading place, with a considerable weaving industry. The town is clean, and well cared for. Its old notoriety for endemic fever and cholera has disappeared before the sanitary improvements of the municipality. The town is prettily situated, 900 feet above sea-level, in a long valley with the Shevaroy Hills towering above. These hills are only 6 miles distant, and the ascent to the plateau is only 7 miles. Though never a place of any military strength, its position in a much contested District has made it the scene of frequent fighting. It was first captured by Captain Wood in 1768. The municipal income of Salem in 1883-84 was \u00a33592; incidence of taxation, 1s. 5d. per head of population within municipal limits.\n\nSalem (Chinna Salem, or Little Salem).\u2014Village in Kallakurchi\nS\u0101letekri.\u2014Zam\u012bnd\u0101r\u012b or revenue-free estate in B\u0101l\u0101gh\u0101t District, Central Provinces; comprising 38 villages; area, 284 square miles, chiefly hilly. Population (1881) 5809. By far the greater part of the zam\u012bnd\u0101r\u012b is uncultivable hill and jungle. At the time of settlement, only 7 villages, with an area of 12\u00bd square miles, entered into engagements for the full period of settlement, the remainder being included in jungle lands, the assessment on which is revised about every three years. With the exception of a few villages lying along the banks of the Son (Soane), the whole estate lies from 1800 to 2000 feet above sea-level. The chief is a descendant of one of the old Gond families, whose principal wealth used to be derived from periodical forays upon the villages in the plains. The country produces timber and bamboos of all descriptions. This chiefship was probably one of the grants made for guarding the passes of the hill country, and has remained in the same family for many generations. The principal village is 50 miles south-east of B\u016brha.\n\nSalimpur.\u2014Town in Lucknow District, Oudh; situated 20 miles from Lucknow city, on the road to Sultanpur. Population (1881) 2078, including some adjacent hamlets. Picturesquely situated on broken and high ground overlooking the Gumti river, the approach to it lying across a ravine spanned by a long bridge built since British annexation. Small Government school.\n\nSalimpur.\u2014Village in Amroha tahsil, Moradabad District, North-Western Provinces; situated in lat. 29\u00b0 5' 45\" N., and long. 78\u00b0 41' E. Population (1881) 2685. Weekly market on Thursdays. Numerous ruins of temples and tombs exist in the neighbourhood.\n\nSalimpur - Majhauli.\u2014Two adjacent villages in Deoria tahsil, Gorakhpur District, North-Western Provinces. \u2014 See MAJHAULI-SALIMPUR.\n\nSalkhi\u00e1.\u2014Northern suburb of Howrah, the chief town of Hugli District, Bengal. The inhabitants are largely engaged in river traffic, and as labourers in the docks, mills, and East Indian Railway. Salkhi\u00e1 also contains a large number of shopkeepers and a permanent market. Along the river-side are several dockyards. A ferry steamer plies daily between Salkhi\u00e1 and Calcutta.\n\nS\u0101lnad\u012b.\u2014River of Bengal.\u2014See SALANDI.\n\nSalon.\u2014Tahsil or Sub-division of R\u00e1i Bareli District, Oudh, lying between 25\u00b0 49' and 26\u00b0 19' N. lat., and between 81\u00b0 16' and 81\u00b0 39' E. long., and comprising the three pargan\u00e1s of Salon, Parsh\u0101depur, and Rokha Jais. Bounded on the north by Digbij\u0101ganj tahsil, on the east by R\u0101ipur and Part\u00e1bgarh tahsils, on the south by Fatehpur District in the North-Western Provinces, and on the west by the R\u00e1i\nBareli tahsil. Area, 433 square miles, or 277,101 acres, of which 143,294 acres are under cultivation. Population (1881) 245,232, namely, males 121,151, and females 124,081. Hindus number 215,969; Muhammadans, 29,240; Jains, 13; and 'others,' 10. Average density of population, 566 persons per square mile. Number of towns and villages, 457, of which 125 are talukdari, 139 zamindari, and 193 pattidari. Land revenue, \u00a328,678. In 1885, Salon tahsil contained 1 criminal court; number of police circles (thanas), 4; strength of regular police, 31 men; village watch or rural police (chaukidars), 781.\n\nSalon.\u2014Pargana in Rai Bareli District, Oudh; recently transferred from Partabgarh District. A picturesque and interesting tract, bounded on the south by the Ganges and on the north by Parshadepur pargana. It is also watered by the Sai river, and is covered with jungle, in which the Na'in talukdars and other freebooters in the time of native rule built their forts. Wild cattle were formerly found in large numbers. The banks of the river are steep and covered with brushwood. Area, 225 square miles, or 144,193 acres, of which 89,224 acres are under cultivation. Land revenue, \u00a314,790. Population (1881) 127,122, namely, males 63,225, and females 63,897. The Kanhpuria clan of Rajputs are the principal landholders, owning 98 out of the 287 villages comprising the pargana. Of the 287 villages, 47 are talukdari, 109 zamindari, and 131 pattidari.\n\nSalon.\u2014Town in Rai Bareli District, Oudh, and head-quarters of Salon tahsil and pargana; situated on the road from Partabgarh to Rai Bareli town, in lat. 26\u00b0 1' 40\" N., and long. 81\u00b0 29' 50\" E. Pleasantly situated amid groves of mango and palm trees. Formerly a flourishing place, but now much reduced. Population (1881) 4777, namely, 2492 Muhammadans and 2285 Hindus, residing in 1026 mud-built and 85 masonry houses. Ten mosques; one Hindu temple. Government school. Average annual bazar sales, \u00a31000. Salon was in ancient times a famous stronghold of the Bhars, the aboriginal rulers of the country. Attached to the town is a revenue-free estate worth \u00a32500 a year, granted as an endowment by the Emperor Aurangzeb, and confirmed by the British Government. The present holder of the estate is Shah Muhammad Mehndi Ata.\n\nSalar Hirapur.\u2014Village in Wardha tahsil, Wardha District, Central Provinces. Population (1881) 2431, namely, Hindus, 2251; Muhammadans, 89; Jains, 57; and non-Hindu aborigines, 34.\n\nSalsette.\u2014Large island to the north of Bombay, forming the Salsette Sub-division of Thana District, Bombay Presidency; extending 16 miles from Bhandara northwards to the Bassein inlet, and connected with Bombay Island by bridge and causeway. Lat. 19\u00b0 2' 30\" to 19\u00b0 18' 30\" N., and long. 72\u00b0 51' 30\" to 73\u00b0 3' E. Area, 241 square miles. Population (1872) 93,324; (1881) 108,149, namely, males 58,540,\nand females 49,609; occupying 16,869 houses, in 3 towns and 110 villages. Hindus number 74,736; Muhammadans, 7036; and 'others,' 26,377. Along the centre of the island, from north to south, runs a broad range of hills, which after subsiding into the plain near Kurla, crops up again in the southernmost point of the island at Trombay. The central and highest, Th\u00e1na peak, is 1530 feet above sea-level; on the north is a detached, sharp peak, 1500 feet high. Spurs from the main range run west towards the sea, while the low lands are much intersected by tidal creeks, which especially on the north-west split the sea-face of the Sub-division into small islands. There are no large fresh-water streams; but the supply of water from wells is of fair quality, and pretty constant. The staple crop is rice; and most of the uplands are reserved for grass for the Bombay market. The coast abounds in cocoa-nut groves, and the palmyra palm grows plentifully over most of the island. This beautiful island is rich in rice-fields, diversified by jungles and studded with hills. The ruins of Portuguese churches, convents, and villas attest its former importance, and its antiquities at Keneri still form a subject of interest. Eighteen estates, consisting of 53 villages, were granted in Salsette by the East India Company; some freehold, and others on payment of rent, and liable to assessment. The lines of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, and of the Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway, traverse the Sub-division.\n\nSeized by the Portuguese early in the 16th century, Salsette should have passed to the English, together with Bombay Island, as part of the marriage portion of the queen of Charles II. The Portuguese in 1662, however, contested its alleged transfer under the marriage treaty, and it was not till more than a century afterwards that possession was obtained. The Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s took it from the declining Portuguese in 1739. The English captured it from the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s in December 1774, and it was formally annexed to the East India Company's dominions in 1782 by the treaty of Salb\u00e1i.\n\nSalsette affords a deeply interesting field for the geologist and natural historian, and it occupies several paragraphs in the official Manual of the Geology of India. It will ever be associated with the name of Victor Jacquemont, as it formed the scene of his last labours; and from its jungles the brilliant Frenchman carried away the fever of which he shortly afterwards died at Bombay.\n\nThe cave architecture of Salsette deserves notice. The great chaitya at Keneri, however, is pronounced by Fergusson to be merely a bad copy of the Karli cave. It belongs to the beginning of the 5th century, but nine of its vih\u00e1ras seem to be of earlier date. Salsette had, however, a sanctity of its own early in the 4th century as containing a tooth of Buddha; at the period, says Fergusson, 'when these relics were revolu-\ntionizing the Buddhist world\u2014at least at two diametrically opposite points of the coast of India, at Puri, and in this island. It may have been in consequence of the visit of this relic that the island became holy; and it may have been because it was an island that it remained undisturbed by the troubles of the mainland, and that the practice of excavating caves lasted longer here than in any series above described. Be this as it may, the caves here go straggling on till they fade by almost imperceptible degrees into those of the Hindu religion. The Hindu caves of Montpezir, Kanduti, and Amboli are so like them, and the change takes place so gradually, that it is sometimes difficult to draw the line between the two religions.\n\nOf the total area of 241 square miles, 37 square miles are occupied by lands of alienated villages. In 1879-80, the holdings numbered 8808, with an average area of $6\\frac{1}{2}$ acres, paying an average Government assessment of \u00a31, 12s. 3d. In 1880-81, 23,243 acres were under actual cultivation, of which 234 acres were twice cropped. Cereals and millets occupied 22,094 acres, of which 21,952 acres were under rice. In 1884, the Sub-division contained 4 civil and 9 criminal courts; police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), 2; regular police, 197 men, inclusive of police at head-quarters. Land revenue (1883), \u00a314,723. The average annual rainfall for the thirteen years ending 1881 was 97'6 inches. Head-quarters at Thana.\n\nSalt Range.\u2014Hill system in Jehlam (Jhelum), Sh\u00e1hpur, and Bannu (Bunnoo) Districts, Punjab, deriving its name from its extensive deposits of rock-salt. Lat. $32^\\circ 41'$ to $32^\\circ 56'$ N., and long. $71^\\circ 42'$ to $73^\\circ$ E. The main chain commences in the lofty hill of Chel, 3701 feet above the sea, which is formed by the convergence of three spurs cropping up from the Jehlam river, and divided from the Himalayan outliers only by the intervening river valley. The most northern of these spurs rises abruptly from the river bank at Sult\u00e1npur, and runs nearly parallel with the Jehlam at a distance of 25 miles, till it joins the main chain after a course of 40 miles. It bears the local name of the N\u00edli Hills. The second spur, known as the Rot\u00e1s range, runs half-way between the N\u00edli Hills and the river, parallel with both. It contains the famous fort of Rot\u00e1s, and the hill of Tilla, the sanitarium of Jehlam District, with an elevation of 3242 feet above sea-level. The third or Pabbi spur rises south of the Jehlam river, dips for a while on approaching the river valley, and rises once more on the northern bank, till it finally unites with the two other chains in the central peak of Chel. Thence the united range runs westward in two parallel ridges, till it culminates in the mountain of Sakeswar, in Sh\u00e1hpur District, which has an elevation of 5010 feet above sea-level. Between these lines of hills, and topped by their highest summits, lies an elevated and fertile table-land, picturesquely intersected by ravines and peaks. In\nits midst nestles the beautiful lake of Kallar Kah\u00e1r. The streams which take their rise in the table-land, however, become brackish before reaching the lowlands.\n\nThe beds of salt, from which the range derives its name, occur in the shape of solid rock on the slopes of this table-land, and form the largest known deposits in the world. The mineral is quarried at the Mayo Mines, in the neighbourhood of the village of Kheura, a few miles north-east of Pind D\u00e1dan Kh\u00e1n, in Jehlam District; at Warcha in Sh\u00e1hpur, and at Kalabagh in Bannu District. The great bulk of the salt is excavated from the Mayo Mines, which, during the 35 years ending 1883\u201384, have yielded a total out-turn of 40,712,943 maunds, or about 18,750 tons, paying a Government revenue in the shape of duty of \u00a38,103,984. The supply is practically inexhaustible. In 1883\u201384, of an entire out-turn of 1,605,671 maunds, or 57,886 tons, from the Salt Range, 1,332,064 maunds, or 48,763 tons, were from the Mayo Mines. The total receipts in the shape of duty in 1883\u201384, from the Mayo, W\u00e1rcha, and K\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1gh mines, amounted to \u00a3330,832, and the charges to \u00a327,879, leaving a net revenue of \u00a3302,953. The construction of a permanent bridge across the Jehlam river at or near Pind D\u00e1dan Kh\u00e1n, in place of the present bridge of boats, now under the consideration of Government, will bring the Mayo Mines into direct railway communication with the rest of India, and avoid the delay and loss at present caused by transhipment.\n\nCoal also occurs in the Salt Range both in oolitic and tertiary strata; the former at K\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1gh, employed as a fuel for the Indus steamers, and the latter between Jal\u00e1lpur and Pind D\u00e1dan Kh\u00e1n. It is of inferior quality, however, consisting of a brown lignite, difficult to set on fire, and yielding a very large proportion of ash.\n\nFrom Jehlam District, the Salt Range stretches into Sh\u00e1hpur and Bannu. The long spur which projects into Sh\u00e1hpur terminates in the hill of Sakeswar, and comprises a number of separate rock-bound alluvial basins, the largest of which, the S\u00fan and Khabbakki valleys, occupy the northern half, while the south consists of a broken country, cut up into tiny glens and ravines by a network of limestone ridges and connecting spurs. In the northern portion of the range, the drainage gathers into small lakes, and trees stud the face of the country; but southward, the streams flow through barren and stony gorges, interspersed with detached masses of rock, and covered with the stunted alkaline plants which grow on soil impregnated with salt. The Bannu portion of the range runs north-westward towards the Indus, which it meets at M\u00e1ri, opposite Kalabagh, and rising again on the western side, is continued in the Khattak-Maidani Hills. The scenery throughout the Range is rugged and often sublime, but wanting in softness and beauty. In many parts it becomes simply barren and\nuninviting. Besides salt and coal, many other valuable minerals occur in these hills.\n\n**Salt-Water Lake** (or Dh\u00e1p\u00e1).\u2014Lake in the District of the Twenty-four Pargan\u00e1s, Bengal; situated about 5 miles east of Calcutta, between the H\u00fagl\u00ed and Bidy\u00e1dhari rivers, and covering an area of about 30 square miles. Lat. $22^\\circ 28'$ to $22^\\circ 36'$ N., and long. $88^\\circ 25' 30\"$ to $88^\\circ 30' 30\"$ E. It contains a section of the Inner Sundarbans Passage for boats bound to Calcutta via B\u00e1li\u00e1gh\u00e1ta. The neighbourhood of the Salt-Water Lake is intersected by innumerable watercourses and rivers, which flood the country at spring-tides. A part of the lake is now in course of reclamation, by the sewage of Calcutta being deposited in it.\n\n**Salumbar.**\u2014Town in the State of Udaipur (Oodeypore), R\u00e1jput\u00e1na; situated 30 miles south of Udaipur town. Population (1881) 5574, namely, Hindus 4831, and Muhammadans 743. The residence of the most powerful of the feudatories of the State, the head of the Chand\u00e1wat clan of R\u00e1jputs. Salumbar gives its name to an estate comprising 109 villages. A masonry wall surrounds the town, which is protected on the north by lofty and picturesque hills, one of which, immediately overlooking it, is surmounted by a fort and outworks still in good repair. An artificial lake, overlooked by the chief's palace, lies to the west of the town.\n\n**S\u00e1l\u00far.**\u2014T\u00e1luk or Sub-division and zam\u00edn\u00e9d\u00e1ri, Vizagapatam District, Madras Presidency. Area, 64 square miles. Population (1881) 80,466, namely, males 39,756, and females 40,710. Hindus number 79,701; Muhammadans, 727; Christians, 3; and 'others,' 35. Number of houses, 17,255; villages, 155. The zam\u00edn\u00e9d\u00e1r was originally feudatory to Jaipur (Jeypore), and afterwards to Vizianagram. The last-named confiscated the zam\u00edn\u00e9d\u00e1ri in 1774, but the Company restored it to the old family twenty years later. The zam\u00edn\u00e9d\u00e1r pays a peshkash or fixed revenue of \u00a33599; total rental, \u00a311,588.\n\n**S\u00e1l\u00far.**\u2014Chief town of S\u00e1l\u00far t\u00e1luk and zam\u00edn\u00e9d\u00e1ri, Vizagapatam District, Madras Presidency. Lat. $18^\\circ 30' 40\"$ N., long. $83^\\circ 14' 50\"$ E. Population (1881) 11,856, namely, males 5746, and females 6110. Hindus number 11,426; Muhammadans, 425; Christians, 3; and 'others,' 2. Number of houses, 2564. S\u00e1l\u00far is the residence of the zam\u00edn\u00e9d\u00e1r. Sub-magistrate's court, post-office, dispensary, and good school.\n\n**Salw\u00edn** (Salween).\u2014River of Burma, with a general north and south course. The source of this river has never been explored; but the best authorities agree in stating that it is in proximity to the source of the Irawadi (Irrawaddy), far up in the snowy range which lies eastward of Assam in lat. $28^\\circ$ N., and forms part of the Him\u00e1layan system of mountains. After traversing Yunan,\na Chinese Province, and the Shan and Karen-n\u00ed States lying south of it, the Salwin enters Lower Burma at its extreme north-eastern corner, and for some distance, as far as the Thaung-yin river, marks the eastern limits of the Province. In this part of its course, the Salwin is a broad, swift stream, navigable by boats, and flowing between high, densely wooded mountains. Farther south, these gorges become narrower; and near the mouth of the Thaung-yin, the breadth of the stream contracts so much that at places its bed does not occupy more than 30 yards.\n\nA few miles lower down, and about 100 miles from the sea, are the great rapids, formed by a bar of rocks stretching completely across the river, and impassable even by canoes during the dry season. In the rains, when the Salwin is swollen by the vast volume of water brought down from the extensive tract of country which it and its tributaries drain, the current is so strong, and the violence of its efforts to pass the rocky ledge so great, that even massive logs of timber are dashed to pieces. Farther south are other but less formidable rapids, impassable in the rains. Below, there are numerous islands and shoals covered during the floods, when the water rises 30 feet. A few miles lower down, after the Salwin has received the Yun-za-lin from the west, the hills on the eastern bank recede, and those on the western diminish considerably in altitude; and the river traverses a more open and level country, with outcrops of limestone on both banks, rising abruptly out of the plain into lofty serrated ridges.\n\nAt Maulmain, the Salwin receives from the eastward the Gyaing, formed by the junction of the Hlaing-bwe and the Haung-tharaw, and the Attaran, which joins the Gyaing at its mouth. Here the Salwin splits into two mouths\u2014the northern, flowing between B\u00ed-l\u00fa-gyw\u00fan and the old town of Martaban, is unnavigable now by reason of sandbanks, but some centuries ago was the principal entrance. The southern branch flows past Maulmain, and falls into the sea at Amherst by a mouth 7 miles wide. By this channel vessels of the largest size can reach Maulmain, but navigation is rendered difficult by the shifting of the sands.\n\nVast quantities of teak from British and foreign forests are annually floated down the Salwin, and shipped at Maulmain for export. The timber is dragged into the forest streams by elephants, marked, and then washed in the rains into the Salwin, by which it is carried down in whirling masses until checked by a rope stretched across the river at Kyo-dan, about 56 miles above Maulmain. Large numbers of salvors assemble here in the season, and raft as many logs as they can, to be claimed by the owners, who pay salvage.\n\nThe area of the Salwin basin is 62,700 square miles; it is 800 miles in length, but seldom more than 100 miles in breadth. The upper part\nis conterminous on the east with that of the Me-kong or Cambodia river; lower down, it is bounded by the Meinam river, which belongs to Siam. The length of the main stream of the Salwin is estimated at 750 miles.\n\n**Salwin Hill Tracts.**\u2014British District in Tenasserim Division, Lower Burma; extending from the northern frontier southwards to Kaw-ka-rit on the Salwin river, and occupying the whole of the country between that river on the east and the Paung-laung Mountains on the west. On the north it is bounded by Karen-n\u00ed (Kareng-nee), on the east by Zin-me, on the south by Amherst and Shwe-gyin, and on the west by Shwe-gyin and Taung-ng\u00fa (Toung-ngoo). Estimated area, 4646 square miles. Population (1881) 30,009 souls. From the annexation of Pegu until 1872, the Hill Tracts formed a Sub-division of Shwe-gyin District, but in that year they were erected into a separate jurisdiction. The administrative head-quarters are at Pa-pun.\n\n**Physical Aspects.**\u2014The whole country is a wilderness of mountains. Even the valley of the Yun-za-lin, the principal river after the Salwin, is, strictly speaking, only a long winding gorge. The direction of the mountains, of which there are three principal ranges, is generally north-north-west and south-south-east, but the spurs from the main system appear to be thrown in bewildering eccentric masses. The slopes are so precipitous, and so densely wooded, that the passage by laden animals is in many places impossible, and that of travellers on foot difficult and fatiguing in the extreme. It is through these hills that Shan caravans come down annually to Rangoon and Maulmain; and with the exception of the routes used by them, there are no roads over which laden bullocks can pass, baggage being carried on men's shoulders.\n\nThe country is drained by three principal rivers\u2014the Salwin, the Yun-za-lin, and the Bi-lin\u2014fed by numerous mountain torrents rushing down narrow ravines, over rocks and boulders, on their way to the larger streams, which partake of the nature of their impetuous tributaries, and dash themselves in foam over masses of rock, or whirl in wild eddies through ravines shut in by beetling crags and gigantic forest trees, covered with brilliant flowers or creepers. When these rivers emerge into the low country they entirely lose their picturesque-ness, and sink into muddy streams, with no trace left of their former state but the rapidity of their currents. The Yun-za-lin is navigable in the dry season as far as Pa-pun. Within the limits of this District, the Bi-lin is impracticable, except for rafts and small boats. The Salwin is impeded by impassable rapids.\n\nIn the mountainous region the soil is reddish clay. Outcrops of gneist shale are met with in places, also indurated sandstone. Limestone occurs in isolated cavernous hills and along the Livehlok range,\nwhere it contains large quantities of rich galena. A lead mine has been opened on the Livehlok, the working of which had not, up to 1882-83, been regularly commenced. The valley of Yun-za-lin is extensive, and contains vast quantities of valuable timber. The soil is rich loam in parts, and nearer the river it appears to be alluvial clay and very fertile. Great facilities exist for irrigating the land in this valley, as perennial streams flow down at right angles to the river at short intervals.\n\nThe population in 1872 was returned at 26,117; in 1877, at 26,649; and in 1881, at 30,009, namely, males 15,509, and females 14,500. Number of villages, 209; occupied houses, 6387; unoccupied houses, 57. Average density of population, 6.46 persons per square mile. Classified according to age, there were\u2014under 15 years, boys 6497, and girls 6007; total children, 12,504, or 41.7 per cent. of the population: 15 years and upwards, males 9012, and females 8493; total adults, 17,505, or 58.3 per cent.\n\nAccording to religion, the population was thus distributed in 1881\u2014Buddhists, 5100; Nat-worshippers, or persons of indigenous religion, 24,738; Hindus, 35; Muhammadans, 105; and Christians, 31. By race, the inhabitants are almost entirely Karens; a few Shans are settled in the neighbourhood of Pa-pun. The eastern portion of the Hill Tracts was formerly inhabited by Yun Shans, whence the name Yun-za-lin; but the majority of these were carried away by Alaungpaya to what is now the Syriam township of Pegu.\n\nSalwin District contains no town. The head-quarters station, Pa-pun, contains less than a thousand inhabitants. The remaining villages, 208 in number, are small, and of no importance; 158, or 75.6 per cent., contain less than two hundred inhabitants; 46 between two and five hundred; and 4 between five hundred and one thousand.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Of the total area of 4646 square miles, only 21 square miles were returned in 1883-84 as under cultivation, and 3116 as cultivable waste. The chief crops are rice and areca-nuts. In 1883-84, 437 acres were under rice (excluding the taungyas), 1524 acres under areca-nuts, and 34 acres under mixed fruit-trees. The cultivation is almost entirely carried on in taungyas or nomadic clearings in the hills, except near Pa-pun, and in the areca-nut groves, which are permanent. Area (1883-84) under taungya cultivation, 11,270 acres; total area under actual cultivation, 13,265 acres.\n\nThe revenue is raised almost entirely from the land and capitation taxes, and amounted in 1883-84 to \u00a31,964, of which \u00a3940 was land revenue. Area of reserved forests, 70 square miles. The education of the District is carried on by the Buddhist priests. Dispensary at the head-quarters station Pa-pun; number of patients treated (1883-84), 2814. Rainfall (1883), 127.19 inches.\nAdministration.\u2014The District is administered by a Commissioner, stationed at Pa-pun, on the Yun-za-lin. Under him are an extra-Assistant Commissioner and the th\u00fagy\u00ed of the six circles of Pa-pun, Kaw-l\u00fa-do, Kaw-ka-rit, Ka-daing-t\u00ed, Me-waing, and Win-pyaing. The District in 1883\u201384 contained 2 civil and 2 criminal courts. The average distance of each village from the nearest court is 25 miles. For some years after the country became British territory, it was in a very unsettled state, but the risings were speedily quelled. In 1867, fresh and more serious disturbances broke out. A chief named D\u00edpa attacked and plundered the villages, and threatened Pa-pun; and from that time dacoities or gang robberies became frequent. This District forms the basis of operations of those who have purchased the right to fell timber in the vast teak tracts beyond the Salw\u00edn river. These foresters come up with large sums in cash, which they require for the payment of their workmen, or for dues to the various chiefs; and in consequence, the whole of the neighbouring country beyond the borders has become the haunt of men who acknowledge no fixed authority, but collect in bodies under some daring leader, fall upon the foresters, and attack the villages of the District. In order to remedy this, the Salwin Hill Tracts were separated from Shwe-gyin in 1872, and formed into a distinct administration, and the police were considerably strengthened. The Commissioner of the District is ex officio Superintendent of Police, and in 1883\u201384 had a force under him of 19 subordinate officers and 232 men, of whom 12 were river police; of these, 156 were Karens, who work well but will not serve for long. The constabulary is quartered at Kaw-l\u00fa-do, at Kyauk-nyat, and Da-kwin on the Salw\u00edn, with a strong reserve at Pa-pun. [For further information regarding the Salw\u00edn Hill Tracts, see the British Burma Gazetteer, 2 vols., compiled by authority (Rangoon Government Press, 1879 and 1880); the British Burma Census Report for 1881; and the several annual Administration and Departmental Reports of the Government of Burma.]\n\nSamadhi\u00e1la.\u2014Petty State in the Gohelw\u00e1r division of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay Presidency; consisting of 1 village with 2 separate tribute-payers or shareholders. Area, 1 square mile. Population (1881) 957. Estimated revenue, \u00a3800; \u00a351 is paid as tribute to the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda, and 16s. to the Naw\u00e1b of Jun\u00e1garh.\n\nSamadhi\u00e1la Chabh\u00e1ria.\u2014Petty State in the Gohelw\u00e1r division of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay Presidency; consisting of 2 villages, with 5 separate tribute-payers or shareholders. Area, 62 square miles. Population (1881) of the State, 1414; and of Samadhi\u00e1la Chabh\u00e1ria village, 689. Estimated revenue, \u00a3650; \u00a3189, 2s. is paid as tribute to the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda, and \u00a338, 18s. to the Naw\u00e1b of Jun\u00e1garh.\n\nSamadhi\u00e1la Char\u00e1n.\u2014Petty State in the Gohelw\u00e1r division of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay Presidency; consisting of 1 village, with\n2 separate tribute-payers or shareholders. Area, 6 square miles. Population (1881) 135. Estimated revenue, \u00a380; no tribute is paid.\n\n**Samadhpur.**\u2014Village in Khut\u00e1han tahsil, Jaunpur District, North-Western Provinces; situated in lat. 26\u00b0 3' 55\" N., long. 82\u00b0 31' 3\" E. Population (1881) 2020, chiefly Muhammadans. The village was originally called B\u00e1nspurwa, owing to its site being covered with bamboos; subsequently named Samadhpur from Samadh P\u00e1ik, the ancestor of the present zamind\u00e1r, by whom the village was peopled. Bi-weekly markets on Tuesdays and Fridays.\n\n**S\u00e1maguting.**\u2014Frontier outpost station and former head-quarters of the N\u00e1g\u00e1 Hills District, Assam; situated in lat. 25\u00b0 45' 30\" N., and long. 93\u00b0 46' E., on a tributary of the Dhaneswari (Dhansiri) river, 2477 feet above sea-level, about 67 miles south of Gol\u00e1gh\u00e1t in Sibs\u00e1gar District. S\u00e1maguting was chosen as a British station in 1867, but abandoned in favour of Kohima in 1878, as being better situated for the supervision of the N\u00e1g\u00e1s; the site more healthy; the water-supply secured by an aqueduct; and the garrison strongly stockaded. The country round S\u00e1maguting is inhabited by the K\u00e1ch\u00e1 tribe of N\u00e1g\u00e1s. Rainfall, 63 inches.\n\n**S\u00e1malkot.**\u2014Town in Cocan\u00e1da t\u00e1luk, God\u00e1var\u00ed District, Madras Presidency.\u2014See CHAMARLAKOTA.\n\n**S\u00e1markha.**\u2014Town in Kaira District, Bombay Presidency. Lat. 22\u00b0 36' N., long. 73\u00b0 2' E. Population, including numerous hamlets (1872), 5231; not separately returned in the Census Report of 1881.\n\n**Sambalpur.**\u2014British District in the Chief Commissionership of the Central Provinces, lying between 21\u00b0 2' and 21\u00b0 57' N. lat., and between 83\u00b0 16' and 84\u00b0 21' E. long. Area (exclusive of the petty Native States attached to the District), 4521 square miles. Population in 1881, 693,499 souls. The seven attached Native States of Karond or Kalahandi, Raigarh, Surangarh, Patna, Sonpur, Rairakhol, and Bamra (all of which see separately) have a total area of 11,897 square miles, and a population of 960,461 souls. Total area of British District and Feudatory States, 16,418 square miles; total population, 1,653,960 souls. Inclusive of the attached States, Sambalpur is bounded on the north by Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur; on the east and south by Cuttack District, Bengal; and on the west by Bil\u00e1spur and Ra\u00edpur Districts. It is the easternmost District of the Chhat\u00edsgarh Division. The administrative head-quarters are at Sambalpur Town.\n\n**Physical Aspects.**\u2014Though included in the Chhat\u00edsgarh Division, Sambalpur forms no part of Chhat\u00edsgarh proper, either geographically or historically. The kh\u00e1lsa or Government portion of the District lies along the valley of the Mah\u00e1nadi, and constitutes a centre round which are clustered the feudatory States and chiefships of Bamra, Karond,\nPATNA, RAIGARH, RAIRAKHOL, SARANGARH, and SONPUR, which are noticed in their respective alphabetical places. This tract spreads out in an undulating plain, with ranges of rugged hills rising in every direction. The largest of these is the Bar\u00e1 Pah\u00e1r, a mountain chain which covers 350 square miles, and attains at Debrigarh a height of 2267 feet above the plain. The main portion of this network of hills is situated in a bend of the Mah\u00e1nadi, by which river it is almost surrounded on three sides; but to the south-west an outlying ridge projects about 30 miles, as far as Singhora gh\u00e1t or Pass, where the road from R\u00e1ipur to Sambalpur winds through it. From this point the hills continue in a southerly direction through Phuljhar, when they turn off abruptly to the westward. Singhora Pass has been the scene of many an action between the predatory Gonds of Phuljhar and their more civilised assailants from the Chhat\u00edsgarh country; and in 1857, our troops under Captain Wood, under Major Shakespear, and under Lieut. Rybot, had successively to fight their way through, when marching to the relief of Sambalpur. Another important range is that of Jargh\u00e1t\u00ed, which crosses the Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur road 20 miles north of Sambalpur town. This also afforded a stronghold to the rebels. Its highest point is 1693 feet above the plain. To the southward a succession of broken ranges run parallel with the Mah\u00e1nadi for about 30 miles, the highest points being Mandhar, 1563 feet, and Bod\u00e1p\u00e1li, 2331 feet. Of the isolated hills and small ranges scattered over the District, the loftiest are\u2014Sun\u00e1ri, 1549 feet; Chel\u00e1, 1450 feet; and Rosor\u00e1, 1646 feet.\n\nThe only important river is the MAHANADI, which rises in R\u00e1ipur District, and, after entering Sambalpur, flows east and south-east for about 65 miles, passing Chandrapur and Padmapur, till it reaches the town of Sambalpur. It then rolls on towards the south for 45 miles, as far as Sonpur, where it bends to the east, finally falling into the sea in Orissa. As far as Chandrapur, its bed is fairly free from obstructions, but from that point to beyond Bod, boulders, jh\u00e1i\u00fa jungle, and even trees impede its current. The principal affluents in Sambalpur are the Ib, Kel\u00fa, and Jhir\u00e1.\n\nSambalpur District is well cultivated, especially west of the Mah\u00e1nadi, where, with the exception of the Bar\u00e1 Pah\u00e1r tract, the jungle and forest have been completely cleared, nothing being left but mango, mahu\u00e1, and other fruit-trees, and here and there a small patch of s\u00e1l. Nearly every village has its tank, often large and deep, but nowhere faced with stone. The Bar\u00e1 Pah\u00e1r Hills are covered with dense jungle; but scattered here and there, small villages, with a fringe of cultivation, nestle in the valleys. The kh\u00e1l\u015ba or State lands, however, yield but little valuable timber. The zamind\u00e1ris contain tracts of s\u00e1l, s\u00e1j, dh\u00e1ur\u00e1, bije-s\u00e1l, and ebony; and in the Garhj\u00e1t States of Phuljhar and R\u00e1irakhol spread vast forests of s\u00e1l.\nIn Sambalpur, the soil is generally light and sandy. Crystalline metamorphic rocks occupy the greater part of the District; but part of the north-west corner is composed of the sandstone, limestone, and shale, which cover so large an area in Chhat\u00edsgarh. In the north occur outlying patches of soft sandstone. Iron-ore is found in most of the zamind\u00e1ris and in the Garhj\u00e1t or Feudatory States, the finest quality being supplied by R\u00e1irakh\u00f3l. Sambalpur has excellent sandstone for building purposes. Limestone also abounds; and the Mah\u00e1nadi, near Padmapur, contains large masses of this rock of a purity resembling marble. Gold dust is yielded by the Mah\u00e1nadi and the Ib; and diamonds are occasionally found at the junction of these rivers, near an island called Hirakhud\u00e1 or the Diamond Isle. In neither case, however, is the supply such as to make the business of collecting remunerative.\n\nHistory.\u2014According to tradition, the first R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Sambalpur was Balr\u00e1n Deva, a brother of Narsingh Deva, the 12th Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 of Patn\u00e1, then the head of the Garhj\u00e1t States. (See PATNA STATE.) Balr\u00e1n Deva obtained from his brother a grant of the jungle country lying beyond the Ung, a tributary of the Mah\u00e1nadi, and gradually acquired a considerable territory by conquest from the neighbouring chiefs of Sarguj\u00e1, G\u00e1ngpur, Bonai, and B\u00e1mr\u00e1. His eldest son, Har\u00ed N\u00e1r\u00e1yan Deva, who followed in 1493, settled the country now called Sonpur on his second son, Madan Gop\u00e1l, whose descendants still hold it. During the next two centuries the power of Sambalpur steadily increased, while that of Patn\u00e1 continued to decline. When Ubhaya Singh succeeded in 1732, these aggressive chiefs first came in contact with the spreading power of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. Some guns of large calibre were passing from Cuttack up the Mah\u00e1nadi, in order to be transported to N\u00e1gpur. Akbar R\u00e1ya, the minister, caused the boatmen to scuttle the boats in deep water, and many Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 artillerymen were drowned. Akbar R\u00e1ya subsequently recovered the guns, and had them mounted on the Sambalpur fort. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 of N\u00e1gpur sent a strong detachment to avenge the insult and regain the guns, but it was repulsed with slaughter.\n\nAbout 1797, in the reign of Jeth Singh, successor to Ubhaya Singh, another quarrel with the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s arose. N\u00e1n\u00e1 Sahib, a relation of the N\u00e1gpur R\u00e1j\u00e1, with a large party, was making a pilgrimage to Jagann\u00e1th, when he was treacherously attacked by the people of S\u00e1ran-garh and Sambalpur, as well as of Sonpur and Bod. He pushed on, however, to Cuttack, where he found some Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 troops. Returning with these, after some severe fighting, he took prisoner the Bod chief and Prithv\u00ed Singh, the chief of Sonpur. As soon as the rains were over, he appeared before Sambalpur, and regularly invested the town. Jeth Singh, however, had meantime strengthened the fort, and it was only after a five months' siege that the N\u00e1n\u00e1 succeeded\nin crossing the moat and forcing the Samkai gate. After a fierce contest, the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s captured the fort, and carried off Jeth Singh and his son Mahar\u00e1j S\u00e1 as prisoners to N\u00e1gpur. Bh\u00fap Singh, a Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 jam\u00e1dd\u00e1r, was left to administer Sambalpur on behalf of the N\u00e1gpur Government. Soon, however, he assumed an independent position; and when a large force was sent from N\u00e1gpur to compel his obedience, he called in the aid of the R\u00e1igarh and S\u00e1rangarh people, and routed the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s at the Singhora Pass. A second force was sent from N\u00e1gpur, and assisted by Chamr\u00e1 G\u00e1onthiy\u00e1, whose enmity Bh\u00fap Singh had provoked by plundering his village, seized the pass, and almost annihilated Bh\u00fap Singh\u2019s army. The conquered chief fled to Sambalpur, and, taking with him the R\u00e1n\u00eds of Jeth Singh, made his way to Kol\u00e1bir\u00e1. While there, he implored the help of the British on behalf of the R\u00e1n\u00eds; and Captain Roughsedge, with a portion of the R\u00e1mgarh local battalion, was sent to Sambalpur in 1804. Raghu\u00ed Bhonsla, the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of N\u00e1gpur, however, remonstrated with the British Government for thus interfering with a country he had fairly conquered, and the British restored Sambalpur to him.\n\nFor some years, the District continued under Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 rule, while Jeth Singh and his son remained in confinement at Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1; but Major Roughsedge pleaded their cause so energetically, that in 1817 Jeth Singh was restored to power. He died in the following year. After some months, during which the British Government held the country, Mahar\u00e1j S\u00e1, his son, was made R\u00e1j\u00e1, though without the feudal superiority of his predecessors over the other chiefships; while Major Roughsedge was established at Sambalpur as Assistant Agent. Mahar\u00e1j S\u00e1 died in 1827, and his widow, R\u00e1n\u00ed Mohan Kum\u00e1ri, succeeded. Disturbances immediately broke out, the most prominent of the rebels being Surendra S\u00e1 and Govind Singh, both Chauh\u00e1ns and pretenders to the chiefship. Villages were plundered to within a few miles of Sambalpur; and though Lieutenant Higgins drove off the rebels, it became necessary for the Agent, Captain Wilkinson, to proceed from Haz\u00e1rib\u00e1gh to Sambalpur. After hanging some of the insurgents, Captain Wilkinson deposed the R\u00e1ni, and set up in her place N\u00e1r\u00e1yan Singh, a descendant by a woman of inferior caste from Bali\u00e1r Singh, third R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Sambalpur. N\u00e1r\u00e1yan Singh accepted his elevation very unwillingly, foreseeing the difficulties which followed immediately on the withdrawal of the British troops. Balabhadra S\u00e1, the Gond chief of Lakhapur, was the first to rise, but at length he was killed at his refuge in the Bar\u00e1 Pah\u00e1r hills.\n\nIn 1839, Major Ouseley became Assistant Agent at Sambalpur; and in the same year great disturbances occurred, caused chiefly by Surendra S\u00e1, who claimed the throne as being descended from Madhukar S\u00e1, fourth R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Sambalpur. In 1840, he and two of his relations murdered\nthe son and father of Dary\u00e1o Singh, chief of R\u00e1mpur, and were sent as life prisoners to the jail of Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur. In 1849, N\u00e1r\u00e1yan Singh died without male issue, and Sambalpur lapsed to the British Government. The first acts of the new rulers were to raise the revenue assessments by one-fourth; and to resume the land grants, religious or otherwise. The Br\u00e1hmans, a powerful community in Sambalpur, went up in a body to R\u00e1nch\u00ed to appeal, but gained no redress. In 1854, a second land settlement again raised the assessments everywhere by one-fourth. Such a system of exaction and confiscation produced its natural results. When the Mutiny broke out three years later, the sepoys released Surendra S\u00e1 and his brother from jail, who immediately proceeded to Sambalpur. Nearly all the chiefs at once joined them, though Govind Singh, the rival pretender of 1827, held aloof.\n\nSurendra S\u00e1 established himself with a large force in the ruins of the old fort, but was induced to give himself up to Captain Leigh. Soon afterwards, however, he escaped, and joined the rebels in the hills. From that time to 1862, the British troops in vain endeavoured to hunt him down. The most daring atrocities were committed by his band: villages friendly to the Government were plundered and burnt; Dr. Moore, a European officer, was murdered; and Lieutenant Woodbridge was killed in a fight on the Bar\u00e1 Pah\u00e1r, and his head carried off. The proclamation of amnesty failed to win the submission of the rebels. In 1861, Major Impey was placed in charge at Sambalpur, and adopted a conciliatory policy. By lavish rewards to the chiefs who gave themselves up, he succeeded in dispersing the rebel band, and procuring the surrender in May 1862 of Surendra S\u00e1 himself. The next year, however, the disturbances recommenced. Sambalpur had recently been incorporated with the Central Provinces, and the opportunity was seized of the first visit of Mr. Temple, the Chief Commissioner, to present a petition praying for the restoration of native rule in the person of Surendra S\u00e1. This was followed by the rising of Kamal Singh, one of Surendra S\u00e1\u2019s captains during the rebellion, and by the recurrence of aggravated outrages. At length, on 23rd January 1864, Surendra S\u00e1 was finally arrested. No legal proof of his complicity with the rebels was forthcoming; but he was placed in confinement with some of his relations and adherents as a dangerous political offender, and since then profound peace has reigned throughout the District.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The Native States attached to Sambalpur District are elsewhere noticed in their respective places. (See Karond, Sonpur, Raiarakhol, Raigarh, Bamra, Patna, and Sarangarh.) The following statistics will therefore be confined to the kh\u00e1lsha country\u2014the British District. A rough enumeration of the population was taken in 1866, but its results cannot be relied on in this District. The Census of 1872 disclosed a population of 523,034 persons. The\nlast enumeration in 1881 returned a total population of 693,499, showing an apparent increase of 170,465 persons, or 32.6 per cent., in nine years. The increase of registered births over deaths accounts for 13.1 per cent. of the increase, the balance being attributed almost entirely to defective enumeration in 1872, especially in the zamindari tracts.\n\nThe results arrived at by the Census of 1881 may be summarized as follows:\u2014Area of District, 4521 square miles, with 1 town and 3256 villages; number of houses, 168,381, namely, occupied 160,359, and unoccupied 8022. Total population, 693,499, namely, males 346,549, and females 346,950. Average density of population, 153 persons per square mile; towns and villages per square mile, 0.72; persons per town or village, 213; houses per square mile, 35.5; persons per house, 4.3. Classified according to sex and age, there are\u2014under 15 years, boys 157,661, and girls 150,836; total children, 308,497, or 44.5 per cent. of the population; 15 years and upwards, males 188,888, and females 196,114; total adults, 385,002, or 55.5 per cent.\n\nReligion.\u2014Classified according to religion, the population of Sambalpur District consists of\u2014Hindus, 632,747, or 91.2 per cent.; Kabirpanthis, 10,120; Satnamis, 212; Kumbhipathias (only found in Sambalpur District), 692; Muhammadans, 2966; Christians, 110; and tribes professing aboriginal religions, 46,652. The total aboriginal population by race as apart from religion, however, is returned at 231,520, namely, Gonds, 57,327; Savars or Sauras, 65,845; Baigas, 40,696; Kur\u00e1s, 18,643; Kandhs, 16,672; Kols, 40,696; Kaw\u00e1rs, 2303; and Bhils, 421.\n\nAmong the recognised Hindu castes, Br\u00e1hmans number 21,828; R\u00e1jputs, 5644; and K\u00e1yasths, 2159. The lower-class Hindus, who comprise the great mass of the population, include the following castes:\u2014Gaur, 79,079; G\u00e1nd\u00e1, 78,622; Kolt\u00e1 or Kolit\u00e1, 67,102; Keut or Kew\u00e1t, 27,453; Tel\u00ed, 22,250; M\u00e1li, 10,824; Cham\u00e1r, 9523; Dum\u00e1l, 9006; Dhobi, 7387; Pank\u00e1, 6637; Ghasi\u00e1, 6543; Loh\u00e1r, 6557; Kumbh\u00e1r, 6148; Kall\u00e1r, 6061; N\u00e1i, 4828; Banj\u00e1ra, 4370; Kori, 3486; Mar\u00e1r, 2596; Kurm\u00ed, 2156; Kosht\u00ed, 1941; Son\u00e1r, 1895; and Mah\u00e1r, 1286.\n\nTown and Rural Population.\u2014The population is entirely rural, and Sambalpur town (population in 1881, 6658) is the only place which contains upwards of five thousand inhabitants. Of the 3256 villages, no less than 2064 are mere hamlets with less than two hundred inhabitants; 923 contain between two hundred and five hundred; 244 between five hundred and a thousand; 21 between one thousand and two thousand; 3 between two thousand and three thousand; and 1 between three thousand and five thousand inhabitants.\n\nAs regards occupation, the Census Report divides the male popula-\ntion into the following six classes:\u2014(1) Professional class, including civil and military, 5206; (2) domestic class, including inn and lodging-house keepers, 2597; (3) commercial class, including bankers, merchants, traders, carriers, etc., 3917; (4) agricultural and pastoral class, including gardeners, 166,420; (5) manufacturing and industrial class, including all artisans, 31,845; and (6) indefinite, non-productive, and unspecified class, comprising general labourers and male children, 3299.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Of the total area of 4521 square miles in the British District, only 1125 square miles were cultivated in 1883\u201384; and of the portion lying waste, 888 square miles were returned as cultivable, while 2508 square miles are uncultivable. Of the total area, however, 161 miles are held revenue-free, leaving 4360 square miles assessed for Government revenue, of which 1018 square miles were cultivated, 880 square miles available for cultivation, and 2462 square miles uncultivable waste. Even of this area, 2891 square miles are comprised within 20 estates or zamind\u00e1ri chiefships, paying a quit-rent or tribute of only \u00a31401, or an average of one penny per cultivated acre. The Government land revenue proper is derived from 1469 square miles, of which 498 square miles are cultivated, 37 square miles available for cultivation, and 934 square miles uncultivable waste. Total Government land revenue with local cesses, excluding the zamind\u00e1r\u00eds, \u00a310,196, or an average of 7\u00bed. per cultivated acre.\n\nIrrigation in 1883\u201384 was practised on 79,515 acres, entirely by private enterprise.\n\nRice forms the staple crop, and in 1883 occupied 579,991 acres. No wheat is grown, but \u2018other food-grains\u2019 were produced on 61,748 acres; while 31,563 acres were devoted to oil-seeds, 33,484 acres to cotton, and 9449 acres to sugar-cane. The agricultural stock in 1883\u201384 was thus returned\u2014cows, bullocks, and buffaloes, 222,053; horses, 684; ponies, 963; sheep and goats, 39,202; pigs, 1063; while carts numbered 12,138, and ploughs 51,177.\n\nOf the adult male and female agricultural population in 1881, namely, 252,419, landed proprietors were returned as numbering 4411; tenant cultivators, 147,745; assistants in home cultivation, 262; agricultural labourers, 33,651; the remainder being made up of graziers, tenants of unspecified status, estate agents, etc. Area of cultivated and cultivable land available for each adult agriculturist, 5 acres. The ordinary price of rice in 1883\u201384 was 3s. per cwt. Skilled labourers earn from 6d. to 8d. per day, and unskilled labourers 2\u00bdd. to 3d. per day.\n\nTrade and Commerce.\u2014The manufactures of Sambalpur are few and unimportant. The Kosht\u00eds, however, weave tasar silk cloth of an even texture and unfading lustre; and the K\u00e1nw\u00e1rs manufacture vessels of brass and bell metal. Nearly every village also contains weavers of\ncoarse cotton cloth, and the Son\u00e1rs make rude ornaments of gold and silver. The principal exports from the District are rice, oil-seeds, raw sugar, stick-lac, *tasar* silk, cotton, and iron. Principal imports\u2014salt, refined sugar, European piece-goods, cocoa-nuts, muslins, fine cloths of native make, and metals. The chief trade is with Cuttack and M\u00edrz\u00e1pur. In the Orissa famine of 1866-67, no less than 30,178 *maunds* (about 1100 tons) of rice, valued at \u00a310,171, were exported to Cuttack. None of the roads in Sambalpur are bridged or metalled. The chief lines of communication are the roads from Sambalpur town to R\u00e1ipur via S\u00e1nkra on the Jonk river; and to Cuttack via Rair\u00e1khol and Ang\u00fal. Tracts also lead from Sambalpur to the Bil\u00e1spur frontier, by Padmapur and Chandrapur, to B\u00ednka, and towards R\u00e1nch\u00ed. The Mah\u00e1nadi affords means of communication by water for 90 miles.\n\n**Administration.**\u2014In 1861, Sambalpur was formed into a separate District of the British Government of the Central Provinces. It is administered by a Deputy Commissioner, with Assistants and *tahsil-d\u00e1rs*. Total revenue in 1883-84, \u00a322,445, of which the land yielded \u00a311,387. Total cost of District officials and police of all kinds, \u00a39537; number of civil and revenue judges of all sorts within the District, 8; magistrates, 9. Maximum distance from any village to the nearest court, 66 miles; average distance, 25 miles. Number of regular and town police, 365, costing \u00a34721; being 1 policeman to about every 12\u00b74 miles and every 1900 inhabitants. The daily average number of convicts in jail in 1883 was 127, of whom 11 were females. The number of Government or aided schools in the District under Government inspection in 1883-84 was 136, attended by 7817 pupils. The Census Report of 1881 returned only 3434 boys and 171 girls as under instruction, besides 10,114 males and 298 females able to read and write, but not under instruction.\n\n**Medical Aspects.**\u2014The average temperature in the shade at the civil station during 1883 is returned as follows:\u2014May, highest reading 116\u00b72\u00b0 F., lowest 75\u00b73\u00b0 F.; July, highest 101\u00b73\u00b0 F., lowest 72\u00b73\u00b0 F.; December, highest 79\u00b77\u00b0 F., lowest 46\u00b78\u00b0 F. The rainfall for that year amounted to 78\u00b751 inches, the average being 57\u00b75 inches. The climate of Sambalpur is considered very unhealthy. The prevailing disease is fever, especially from September to November. It proves most fatal to new-comers, natives as well as Europeans. Bowel complaints are also common and deadly, and cholera appears nearly every hot season, owing to the gatherings at the temple of Jagann\u00e1th at Pur\u00ed. In 1883, two charitable dispensaries afforded medical relief to 21,035 in-door and out-door patients. The death-rate per thousand in 1883-84 was returned at 26\u00b719, the mean of the previous five years being 26\u00b707, but these figures cannot be trusted. [For further information regarding Sambalpur, see the *Central Provinces Gazetteer*, by Mr. (now Sir\nCharles) Grant (N\u00e1gpur, 1870). Also the Report of the Land Settlement of Sambalpur District, between 1872 and 1877, by Mr. A. M. Russell, published 1883; the Central Provinces Census Report for 1881; and the several annual Administration and Departmental Reports of the Central Provinces Government.\n\nSambalpur.\u2014Tahsil or Sub-division of Sambalpur District, Central Provinces. Area, 1500 square miles, with 1 town and 1499 villages, and 69,418 houses. Population (1881) 297,361, namely, males 147,973, and females 149,388; average density of the population, 169.1 persons per square mile. Of the total area of the tahsil, 893 square miles are comprised within nine zamind\u00e1ri estates or chiefships, which pay only a nominal tribute or quit-rent; while 135 square miles are held entirely revenue-free. The Government revenue-paying lands occupy an area of 730 square miles, of which 241 square miles are cultivated, 14 square miles are cultivable, and 475 square miles are uncultivable waste. Total adult agricultural population, 67,462, or 40.17 per cent. of the whole population in the kh\u00e1lisa or Government tract. Average area of cultivated and cultivable land available for each adult agriculturist, 3 acres. Total Government land revenue, including local rates and cesses levied on land, \u00a33960, or an average of 5d. per cultivated acre. Sambalpur tahsil contained in 1883, 5 civil and 7 criminal courts (including the District head-quarters courts); with 4 police stations (th\u00e1nds) and 11 outpost stations, a regular police force numbering 97 men, and a village watch or rural police of 715 chaukid\u00e1rs.\n\nSambalpur.\u2014Principal town and administrative head-quarters of Sambalpur District, Central Provinces. The town is situated in lat. 21\u00b0 27' 10\" N., and long. 84\u00b0 1' E., on the north bank of the Mah\u00e1nadi, which, during the rainy season, becomes nearly a mile broad, but at other times flows in a small stream 50 yards in width. Opposite the town and station, the river bed is a mass of rocks covered with thick jh\u00e1\u00fa jungle; on each side the banks are richly wooded with mango and other groves, while to the south rises a stately background of lofty hills. Population (1872) 11,020; (1881) 13,939, namely, males 6658, and females 7281. Hindus number 10,619; Muhammadans, 1298; Kumbhi\u00e1p\u00e1thi\u00e1s, 79; Kab\u00edranthi\u00e1s and Satn\u00e1m\u00eds, 6; Christians, 104; and tribes professing aboriginal religions, 1833. Municipal income in 1882-83, \u00a31808, of which \u00a31531 was derived from taxation; average incidence of taxation, 2s. 3\u00bdd.\n\nThe town proper has been much improved since 1864, when a cart could only with great difficulty pass through the main street. To the north-west lie the ruins of the fort\u2014a crumbling stone wall on the river face, and a few mouldering bastions. The moat can still be traced; but no gateway remains except that of Saml\u00e1\u00ed, near the temple of the goddess of that name, who was apparently the tutelary divinity of\nSambalpur. Within the fort stand several other temples, the principal of which are those of Padmeswari Devi, Bar\u00e1 Jagann\u00e1th, and Anant Sajj\u00e1, all built during the 16th century. They are of uniform design, and remarkable neither for elegance nor solidity. Beyond the fort extends the Bar\u00e1 B\u00e1z\u00e1r, originally a mere market-place, but now a populous suburb. Besides the Government court-house and the Subdivisional office on the river bank, the principal buildings are the Commissioner's circuit-house, post-office, a jail lately built on the standard plan, and 2 sar\u00e1sis, as well as a handsome terrace-roofed market-place. A native gentleman has lately built a dispensary with female wards, and a District schoolhouse. Till recently, cholera visited the town almost every year, owing chiefly to the influx of pilgrims returning from Pur\u00ed. Of late, however, sanitary precautions have done much to prevent the epidemic, and the increase of vaccination is gradually restraining the ravages of small-pox.\n\n**Sambhal.**\u2014Tahsil of Morad\u00e1b\u00e1d District, North-Western Provinces, lying in the plain country between the Sot and the Ganges, conterminous with Sambhal pargan\u00e1. It is about 32 miles long by 15 miles broad, and consists of two great natural divisions, the *katehr* or 'hard,' and the *bh\u00far* or sandy tracts. Their border-line runs north-east and south-west, down the centre of the tahsil, parallel to the course of the Sot. The low lands of that river form a belt of from two to three miles wide, right through the *katehr* tract. The soil of the *katehr* is described as of a dark colour, assimilating in appearance to *matiy\u00e1r*; and some villages in which it predominates are among the finest in the District. The *bh\u00far* or sandy tract consists of ridges of loose, soft sand, alternating with extensive flats of more cohesive soil, in which there is a very slight admixture of loam. All over the *bh\u00far* tract are large unploughed wastes, utilized in dry seasons as grazing grounds. Several important but unmetalled roads meet at Sambhal town.\n\nThe total area of Sambhal tahsil in 1881-82 was 468\u00b774 square miles, of which 443\u00b713 square miles were assessed for Government revenue, namely, 360\u00b734 square miles cultivated, 55\u00b769 square miles cultivable, and 27\u00b710 square miles uncultivable. Population (1881) 248,107, namely, males 130,441, and females 117,666; average density of population, 530 persons per square mile. Classified according to religion, Hindus numbered 173,850; Muhammadans, 73,808; Christians, 273; and Jains, 180. Of the 465 towns and villages comprising the tahsil, 323 had less than five hundred inhabitants; 111 between five hundred and a thousand; 28 between two and three thousand; and 3 upwards of five thousand inhabitants. Total Government land revenue (1881-82), \u00a335,291, or including local rates and cesses levied on land, \u00a339,832. Total rental paid by cultivators, including cesses, \u00a381,181.

The modern town covers the summit of an extensive mound, composed of remains and d\u00e9bris of the ancient city. Two heaps of ruins, known as Bhaleswar and Bikteswar, mark the old bastions of the city wall. The town formed the head-quarters of the local Government from the earliest period of Muhammadan supremacy, and was the capital of a sark\u00e1r under Akbar. Population (1881) 21,373, namely, males 10,659, and females 10,714; number of houses, 4710. Classified according to religion, Muhammadans number 13,965; Hindus, 7333; Jains, 38; and Christians, 37. Municipal income (1883\u201384), \u00a31588, of which \u00a31471 was derived from taxation; average incidence of taxation, 10d. per head of the population (35,196) within municipal limits.\n\nSambhal is a prettily situated town, with the houses mostly built of brick. Only in the town and suburbs are there any metalled roads; but unmetalled ones connect it with Morad\u00e1b\u00e1d, Bil\u00e1ri, Amroh\u00e1, Chandaus\u00ed, Bahjoi, and Hasanpur. The public buildings include the tahs\u00edli or sub-collectorate offices, muns\u00edfi or subordinate judges\u2019 court, police station, post-office, dispensary, American mission church and schools, several municipal schools, distillery, and a sar\u00e1\u00ed or native inn. Refined sugar is the chief manufacture, and also the principal article of trade. Wheat and other grains and gh\u00ed are also exported, and there is some export of hides. Cotton cloth is manufactured, but chiefly for local wants.\n\n**Sambhar.**\u2014Great salt lake in the States of Jaipur (Jeypore) and Jodhpur, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. The lake lies between $26\u00b0\\ 52'$ and $27\u00b0\\ 2'$ N. lat., and between $74\u00b0\\ 57'$ and $75\u00b0\\ 16'$ E. long., on the joint border of the States, 40 miles north-west of Ajmere, and within the line of hills which mark the general north-westward run of the Aravalli range as it begins to lose continuity and to subside. The land all round slopes towards the lake, which thus forms a great basin with no outlet, containing a shallow sheet of water. The surrounding country is arid and sterile, being composed of rocks abounding in limestone and salt, and belonging to the Permian system; and it is supposed that the salt of the lake is derived from the washings of these rocks. The bottom consists of a tenacious black mud, resting on loose sand. When full, the lake forms a sheet of water measuring about 20 miles in length, from 3 to 10 miles in breadth, and from 1 to 4 feet in depth.\nAfter the rains, in August and September, the waters of the lake begin to evaporate, and this process goes on almost uninterruptedly from October to June. In very hot and dry summers, the wet bed is little more than a mile in length and less than half a mile across. The lake's longest stretch is nearly east and west; and the deeper portion, which never dries up, and which is locally called 'the treasury,' is situated near the centre of the lake, almost opposite a bold rocky promontory (M\u00e1ta-ki-devi) which juts out from the southern shore.\n\nIn the dry season, the view of the lake is very striking. Standing on the low sandy ridges which confine the basin on the south, one may see what looks like a great sheet of snow, with pools of water here and there, and a network of narrow paths marking the near side of it. What appears to be frozen snow is a white crisp efflorescence of salt. The salt is both held in solution in the water of the lake, and also pervades in minute crystals the whole substance of black mud that forms so large a part of its bed.\n\nThis valuable property has often been fiercely contested. The lake was worked by the Imperial administration of Akbar and his successors up to the time of Ahmad Sh\u00e1h, when it fell back into the hands of the R\u00e1jput Chiefs of Jaipur and Jodhpur. The eastern shore, and part of the southern shore, are now the joint possession of Jaipur and Jodhpur; the rest belongs to Jaipur. During the ten years 1835 to 1844, the Government of India, in order to repay itself a portion of the expenses incurred in repelling the predatory incursions of the R\u00e1jputs into British territory, took the salt-making into its own hands; but with this exception, the lake has been owned and worked jointly by the Jaipur and Jodhpur Governments from the 17th century to 1870, when the British Government became lessees under separate treaties concluded with the two chiefs.\n\nAs soon as the salt is formed, native labourers of both sexes wade out to it through the mud, and placing their hands under the salt crust, lift it off in good-sized cakes into baskets. A man brings to shore in this way about half a ton of salt a day. The salt is also made in shallow pans, into which the brine is baled; and in walled enclosures, the beds of which are sunk below the level of the lake. Nearly the whole of the salt extracted is white or slightly discoloured. Some portions are blue and red, the varieties being said to be due to the presence of microscopic algae. The S\u00e1mbhar lake supplies nearly all the chief salt marts of the Punjab, the North-Western Provinces, and Central India. The town of S\u00e1mbhar within the joint jurisdiction of Jaipur and Jodhpur States, and Nawa and Gudha in Jodhpur State on the opposite side of the lake, have recently been connected by a branch line with the R\u00e1jput\u00e1na-M\u00e1lw\u00e1 Railway. According to travellers in the early part of this century, the dimensions of the lake were larger\nthan they are at present, and reached as much as 50 miles in length by 10 in breadth during periods of heavy rain.\n\nThe average yearly out-turn for the 15 years ending 1883-84, since the Government of India leased the lake, has been 2,800,000 maunds (about 100,000 tons). The average cost of storage and extraction, about 6 p\u00e9es (three farthings) a maund (82\u00bd lbs.). From the beginning of the lease to 1883-84, the quantity of salt manufactured was 42,039,480 maunds (about 1,500,000 tons); the total sales amounted to 31,998,365 maunds, yielding a revenue of \u00a31,393,739; total charges, including treaty payments, \u00a31,210,983; net credit balance, \u00a3182,756. In 1883-84, the total quantity of salt manufactured at Sambhar lake was 7,111,353 maunds. Gross realizations, including duty, \u00a3880,606; the direct charges amounted to \u00a358,395, and payments made under treaties, \u00a375,495; total, \u00a3133,890, leaving a surplus of \u00a3746,716. The labour employed in 1883-84 was\u2014labourers, 421,925; carts, 38,757; cattle, 33,987.\n\nSambhar.\u2014Town within the joint jurisdiction of Jaipur and Jodhpur States, on the bank of the Sambhar lake, Rajputana; situated 39 miles south-west of Jaipur city. Population (1881) 5574. Hindus number 4831, and Muhammadans 743. A station on the Sambhar branch of the Rajputana-Malwa Railway.

One of the busiest marts in the District for country produce of all kinds; large exports of jute. In 1876-77, the registered exports from Sambhuganj included 72,000 maunds of jute (mostly sent direct to Calcutta), 31,000 maunds of rice, and 9500 maunds of mustard seed. No later trade statistics are available.\n\nSameswari (Someswari, or Samsang).\u2014River in the Garo Hills, Assam. Rising near the station of Tur\u00e1, it flows first in an easterly direction along the north of the Tur\u00e1 range, and then turns south through a picturesque gorge and finds its way into the plains in the Bengal District of Maimansingh. It finally empties itself into the Kanks river in Pargan\u00e1 Susang. Both in size and utility, the Sameswari is the most important river in the Garo Hills. It is navigable up-stream as high as Siju, about 20 miles within the hills. Here its channel is interrupted by a bed of granite rocks and rapids. In several other portions of its course it again becomes navigable for canoes. Valuable outcrops of coal have been discovered and surveyed in the Sameswari valley, but none has yet been worked. Limestone of good quality abounds on the river banks, and there are some curious caverns in the limestone formation. The largest of these caves lies near Siju, and has been explored for a whole day without reaching the source of a small stream which issues from the cave. Above Siju, the Sameswari flows through\na tract of sandstone, in which extensive coal-beds have been discovered on both sides of the river; but up to 1884 they had not been worked otherwise than experimentally. In its upper course are several magnificent gorges, with rocky cliffs, clothed in tropical vegetation. The water swarms with fish, including the excellent m\u00e1hsir; and the G\u00e1ros are enthusiastic fishermen.\n\n**Sami.**\u2014Town in R\u00e1dhanpur State, Bombay Presidency.\u2014See Shami.\n\n**Samla.**\u2014Petty State in the Jh\u00e1l\u00e1w\u00e1r division of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay Presidency; consisting of 2 villages, with 4 separate tribute-payers or shareholders.

The buildings stand in lat. 30\u00b0 54' 35\" N., and long. 77\u00b0 2' 10\" E., on a wooded hill facing Kasauli, which is 3 miles distant. They consist of boys and girls' schools, and the residences of the Principal, with a staff of teachers, and a church. The institution, which is undenominational, accommodates from 400 to 500 children. In September 1883, there were 424 boys and girls on the rolls, including 64 in the orphanage.\n\nSanchi.\u2014Village in the Native State of Bhopal, Central India; situated on the left bank of the Betwa river, about 5\u00bd miles southwest of Bhilsa, and 20 miles north-east of Bhopal city. Sanchi is famous as the site of some of the most extensive and remarkable Buddhist remains in India, the centre of the great group described by General Cunningham under the name of 'The Bhilsa Topes.'\n\nThe present village of Sanchi is situated on a low ridge of sandstone, the general direction of which is from north to south, the whole summit of the hill being covered with ruins. The hill is flat-topped and isolated, with a steep cliff to the eastward, and to the westward an easy slope, covered with jungle at the foot, and near the top broken into steps by horizontal ledges of rock.\n\nThe principal buildings which now remain occupy only the middle part of the level summit, and a narrow belt leading down the hill to the westward. They consist of one great stupa or tope, with its railing and other adjuncts; about ten smaller stupas, some now showing nothing more than the foundations; a stone bowl, 4\u00bd feet in diameter and 2\u00bd feet deep, supposed to have once contained Buddha's holy nettle, and other objects of antiquarian interest. The summit of the hill, on which these remains are found, has a gentle slope in the same direction as the dip of the strata; and the level of the court of the great stupa is about 12 or 15 feet below that of a ruined vihara and temple on the eastern edge of the precipice. The hill, which is about 300 feet in height, is formed of a light red sandstone, hard and compact in texture, but subject to split. This stone has been used for all the stupas and other buildings where mere hardness and durability\nwere required; but for the colonnades and sculptured gateways, a fine-grained white sandstone was brought from the Udayagiri Hill, $3\\frac{1}{2}$ miles to the northward. The village is now very small; but the numerous ruins scattered over the hill between S\u00e1nchi and K\u00e1nakhera show that there once was a large town on this site. Plaster casts of the gateways, etc., of the topes have been sent to England.\n\nFergusson (History of Indian and Eastern Architecture, 1876, page 61) thus writes of this group of remains:\n\n'The principal of these, known as the Great Tope at S\u00e1nchi, has been frequently described, the smaller ones are known from General Cunningham's descriptions only; but altogether they have excited so much attention that they are perhaps better known than any group in India. We are not, however, perhaps justified in assuming, from the greater extent of this group as now existing, that it possessed the same pre-eminence in Buddhist times. If we could now see the topes that once adorned any of the great Buddhist sites in the Do\u00e1b or Behar, the Bhilsa group might sink into insignificance. It may only be that, situated in a remote and thinly peopled part of India, they have not been exposed to the destructive energy of opposing sects of the Hindu religion, and the bigoted Moslem has not wanted their materials for the erection of his mosques. They consequently remain to us, while it may be that nobler and more extensive groups of monuments have been swept from the face of the earth.\n\n'Notwithstanding all that has been written about them, we know very little that is certain regarding their object and their history. Our usual guides, the Chinese Pilgrims, fail us here. Fa-Hian never was within some hundreds of miles of the place; and if Hiuen Tsiang ever was there, it was after leaving Ballabhi (Valabhi), when his journal becomes so wild and curt that it is difficult, sometimes impossible, to follow him. He has, at all events, left no description by which we can now identify the place, and nothing to tell us for what purpose the Great Tope or any of the smaller ones were erected. The Mah\u00e1wanso, it is true, helps us a little in our difficulties. It is there narrated that Asoka when on his way to Ujjain, of which place he had been nominated governor, tarried some time at Ch\u00e9tyagiri, or, as it is elsewhere called, Wessanagara, the modern B\u00edsnagar, close to S\u00e1nchi. He there married Devi, the daughter of the chief, and by her had twin sons, Ujjenio and Mahindo, and afterwards a daughter, Sanghamitta. The two last-named entered the priesthood, and played a most important part in the introduction of Buddhism into Ceylon. Before setting out on this mission, Mahindo visited his royal mother at Ch\u00e9tyagiri, and was lodged in \"a superb vih\u00e1ra,\" which had been erected by herself. In all this there is no mention of the Great Tope, which may have existed before that time; but till some building is\nfound in India which can be proved to have existed before that age, it will be safe to assume that this is one of the 84,000 topes said to have been erected by Asoka. Had S\u00e1nchi been one of the eight cities which obtained relics of Buddha at the funeral pyre, the case might have been different; but it has been dug into, and found to be a stupa, and not a daghoba. It consequently was erected to mark some sacred spot or to commemorate some event, and we have no reason to believe that this was done anywhere before Asoka\u2019s time.\n\n\u2018On the other hand, two smaller topes on the same platform contained relics of an undoubted historical character. That called No. 2 Tope contained those of ten Buddhist teachers who took part in the third great convocation held under Asoka, and some of whom were sent on missions to foreign countries, to disseminate the doctrines then settled; and No. 3 Tope contained two caskets. One of these enclosed relics of Maha Moggalana, the other of Sariputra, friends and companions of Buddha himself, and usually called his right and left hand disciples. It does not of course follow that this daghoba is as old as the time of Buddha; on the contrary, some centuries must elapse before a bone or rag belonging to any mortal becomes so precious that a dome is erected to enshrine it. The great probability seems to be that these relics were deposited there by Asoka himself, in close proximity to the sacred spot which the Great Tope was erected to commemorate. The tope containing relics of his contemporaries must of course be much more modern, probably contemporary with the gateways, which are subsequent to the Christian era.\u2019\n\nSan-daw (Tshan-daw).\u2014A small pagoda situated amid the hills on the left bank of Sandoway town, Sandoway District, Arakan Division, Lower Burma. Built in 784 A.D. by King Nyo-kin, to enshrine a hair of Gautama. The inhabitants of Sandoway town spend one day at this temple in March, June, and October of each year, spending the other days during which their feasts last at the pagodas of An-daw and Nan-daw.\n\nS\u00e1ndi.\u2014Pargan\u00e1 in Bilgr\u00e1m tahsil, Hardoi District, Oudh. Bounded on the north and west by pargan\u00e1s B\u00e1wan, Barw\u00e1n, and Kati\u00e1ri; on the south-west and south by the Ganges and pargan\u00e1 Bilgr\u00e1m; and on the east by pargan\u00e1 Bangar. The pargan\u00e1 is intersected by the Garra river from north to south, and the R\u00e1mgang\u00e1 flows irregularly along or near its western and south-western border. It is divided into two distinct portions by an irregular sandy ridge, which, running from north to south immediately to the east of S\u00e1ndi town, marks the bank of an ancient channel of the Ganges, long since abandoned by the river in its gradual westward recession. All the villages on and to the east of this ridge are poor, uneven, and sandy. Irrigation is scanty and difficult. On the other hand, all the country to the west of the ridge, or about four-fifths of the\ntotal area of the pargan\u00e1, is a distinctly alluvial tract, levelled and enriched by the floods of three Him\u00e1layan rivers, the Garra, R\u00e1mgang\u00e1, and Ganges, and by minor streams such as the Sendha. All this tract is tar\u00fati, that is to say, it has been scooped by fluvial action out of the adjacent bangar or original plateau; and in it the water level is always so near the surface, that in the dry months percolation largely supplies the want of irrigation, while in the rainy season it is more or less completely flooded. It constitutes, in fact, the flood basin of the three rivers named above. In heavy floods such as those of 1871, a sea of waters spreads from S\u00e1ndi to Fatehgarh, 20 miles west. The rivers bring down a rich alluvial deposit locally called seo, which fertilizes the submerged fields and makes manuring unnecessary. The silt brought down by the R\u00e1mgang\u00e1 in heavy floods is sometimes spread 2 feet thick over the fields. Area, 168 square miles, of which 107 square miles are cultivated. Chief products \u2014 wheat, barley, rice, b\u00e1jra, gram, jo\u00e1r, and arhar. Population (1881) 72,830, namely, males 39,749, and females 33,081. Of the 141 villages in the pargan\u00e1, 80\u00bd are held by R\u00e1jputs, 26 by Muhammadans, 11\u00bd by Br\u00e1hmans, 5\u00bd by Lodhs, 4 by K\u00e1yasths, 1\u00bd by Ahirs, and 12 by Government. T\u00e1lukd\u00e1ri tenure prevails in 30\u00bd villages, zam\u00ednd\u00e1ri in 61\u00bd, and pattid\u00e1ri in 49. Government land revenue, \u00a312,056; equal to an average of 3s. 6d. per cultivated acre, or 2s. 3d. per acre of total area.\n\nS\u00e1ndi.\u2014Town and municipality in Hardoi District, Oudh, and headquarters of S\u00e1ndi pargan\u00e1; situated on the left bank of the Garra river, on the old route from Sh\u00e1jh\u00e1h\u00e1npur via Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d to Lucknow. Lat. 27\u00b0 17' 15\" N., long. 79\u00b0 59' 45\" E. A considerable town, with a population (1881) of 9810, namely, Hindus, 6780; Muhammadans, 3022; and Christians, 8. Municipal income (1883\u201384), \u00a3471, of which \u00a3366 was derived from taxation; average incidence of taxation, 9d. per head. S\u00e1ndi has a local reputation for the manufacture of a description of cotton carpets (kalin). Numerous handsome mosques and tombs of Muhammadan saints. A fine sar\u00e1i or travellers\u2019 rest-house is situated in the market in the Naw\u00e1bganj quarter of the town.\n\nSand\u00edla.\u2014Tahsil or Sub-division of Hardoi District, Oudh, lying between 26\u00b0 53' and 27\u00b0 21' N. lat., and between 80\u00b0 18' and 80\u00b0 52' E. long. Bounded on the north by Hardoi and Misr\u00edkh, on the east by Mahmud\u00e1b\u00e1d, on the south by Malih\u00e1b\u00e1d and Mohan, and on the west by B\u00edlgr\u00e1m tahs\u00edls. Area, 557 square miles, of which 317 are cultivated. Population (1881) 250,406, namely, Hindus 225,496, and Muhammadans 24,910. Number of males, 132,372; females, 118,034; number of villages, 415; average density, 449 persons per square mile. This tahsil comprises the four pargan\u00e1s of Sand\u00edla, Kaly\u00e1nmal, B\u00e1l\u00e1mau, and Gundwa. In 1883 it contained 4 civil and 6 criminal courts, including\na bench of Honorary Magistrates; number of police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), 4; strength of regular and town police, 110 men; village watch or rural police (chaukid\u00e1rs), 681.\n\n**Sandila.**\u2014Pargan\u00e1 of Hardoi District, Oudh. Bounded on the north by Gop\u00e1mau; on the east by Gundwa and Kaly\u00e1nmal; on the south and south-west by Mohan, Aur\u00e1s, Safipur, and Bangarmau; and on the west by B\u00e1lamau and Mallanw\u00e1n pargan\u00e1s. A poorly wooded tract, with a large area of barren and sandy soil. Area, 329 square miles, of which 170 square miles are cultivated. Chief products\u2014barley, wheat, b\u00e1jra, gram, arhar, mash, and jo\u00e1r. At the time of the survey, barley occupied a fourth of the cultivated area; wheat a fifth; b\u00e1jra and gram together, rather more than a fifth; while another fifth was under arhar, mash, jo\u00e1r, and rice. Other crops\u2014cotton, sugar-cane, poppy, tobacco, and indigo. Population (1881) 151,440, namely, Hindus 130,910, and Muhammadans 20,530. Of the 213 villages comprising the pargan\u00e1, 82 are held by R\u00e1jputs, 81 by Muhammadans, 41 by K\u00e1yasths, 5 by Br\u00e1hmans, 2 by Kurmis, and 1 each by Kalw\u00e1rs and Lodhs. T\u00e1lukd\u00e1ri tenure obtains in 114 villages, 70 are zamin\u00e9d\u00e1ri, 26 imperfect pattid\u00e1ri, and 3 bh\u00e1y\u00e1ch\u00e1ra. Government land revenue, \u00a318,299; equal to an average of 3s. 4d. per cultivated acre, or 1s. 9d. per acre of total area. The principal landholding families are Sayyid Musalm\u00e1ns.\n\n**Sandila.**\u2014Town and municipality in Hardoi District, Oudh, and head-quarters of Sandila tahsil and pargan\u00e1; situated 32 miles north-west of Lucknow, and 34 miles south-east of Hardoi town. Lat. 27\u00b0 4\u2032 15\u2033 N., long. 80\u00b0 33\u2032 20\u2033 E. The fourth largest town in Oudh, and the second largest in Hardoi District. Population (1881) 14,865, namely, males 7366, and females 7499. Muhammadans number 7487; Hindus, 7373; and Christians, 5. Municipal income (1883\u201384), \u00a3745, of which \u00a3724 was derived from taxation; average incidence of taxation, 11\u00bdd. per head of the population. The town contains the usual Sub-divisional civil and criminal courts, police station, dispensary, and Anglo-vernacular school. No buildings of special interest or antiquity. The b\u00e1ra kambha or hall of twelve pillars, a stone building, was erected about 150 years ago. Markets are held twice a week, at which p\u00e1n and gh\u00ed are sold for export in considerable quantities. Station on the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway. During the Mutiny, two severe actions were fought at Sandila on the 6th and 7th October 1858.\n\n**Sandoway (Than-dwai).**\u2014British District in the Arakan Division, Lower Burma. Area, 3667 square miles. Population (1881) 64,010 souls. Bounded on the north by the Ma-i river, separating it from Kyauk-pyu District; on the east by the Arakan Mountains; on the south by the Gwa river; and on the west by the Bay of Bengal. Its\nextreme length is 136 miles; its breadth in the north 48, and in the south 24 miles. The administrative head-quarters are at Sandoway Town.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014Sandoway District is a mountainous country, the Arakan range sending out spurs which reach to the coast. These in their turn give off numerous sub-spurs, running for the most part parallel to the main chain. The surface configuration of the District is so disrupted by the influence of igneous action that not more than one-eighteenth of the area can be called plain; and except in this plain, and on the hillsides, where clearings are made for taungya or nomadic cultivation, the District is covered with dense forest. From the mouth of the Sandoway river northwards, the coast is indented with navigable and intercommunicating tidal creeks, by means of which communication can be kept up without going out to sea. Southwards, it presents a rugged and rocky barrier to the ocean, and has few available harbours. The rivers draining the District are but mountain torrents to within a few miles of the coast. The principal of these are\u2014the Ma-\u00ed and the Tan-lwe, falling into the arm of the sea which divides Ramri island from the mainland; the Taung-gup (Toung-goop), which enters the Bay of Bengal by several mouths, between lat. $18^\\circ 44'$ and $18^\\circ 50'$ N.; the Sandoway, a tidal river, navigable by the largest boats as far as Sandoway town; the Gwa, which falls into the sea in about lat. $17^\\circ 36'$ N., forming a good anchorage for steamers and vessels drawing from 9 to 10 feet of water, though the entrance is rendered difficult by rocks and a sandy bar.\n\nThe main range of the Arakan Yomas has in the north a direction south-east by south, but it gradually curves towards the west, and, at the source of the Gwa, runs nearly due north and south. In the north, some of the peaks attain an elevation of little less than 5000 feet, which falls to 3200 feet at Shauk-bin, where the Taung-gup road crosses the range. South of lat. $18^\\circ 21' 26''$ N., the height rapidly diminishes, and at the sources of the Gwa is only about 890 feet. The chief pass is that from Taung-gup to Pa-daung on the Irawadi (Irrawaddy) in Prome District, a route followed by the main body of the Burmese in their invasion of Arakan in 1784, but found impracticable for troops or beasts of burden in 1825\u201326. Since then, the road has been considerably widened, and rendered fit for the passage of an armed force. It is now mostly used by traders from Pegu, and the telegraph line to Calcutta is carried along it. Another pass connects Gwa with Le-myet-hna in Bassein.\n\nThe three most important timber-trees found in the District are\u2014pyin-gado (Xylia dolabriformis), used in house-building and for railway sleepers; in (Dipterocarpus tuberculatus), and ka-gnyin (Dipterocarpus alatus), from which are extracted resin and oil respectively. Pyin-ma\n(Lagerstroemia Flos-Regin\u00e6), *thin-gan* (Hopea odorata), *ka-gnyaung* (Dipterocarpus turbinatus), and many other trees abound. The low ground within tidal limits is covered with dense mangrove jungle. The area of reserved forest in 1883\u201384 was 307 square miles.\n\nOwing to the wild and inaccessible character of the greater portion of Sandoway District, its geological structure has received very cursory examination. The existence of cretaceous rocks was first established in 1872. Mr. Theobald says that they extend down from Kyauk-pyu District, in lat. 29\u00b0 30' N., certainly as far as Kyein-ta-l\u00ed in Sandoway, a distance of 94 miles. Limestone occurs about 4 miles south-south-west of Ma-l\u00ed, where it is quarried and burned for local use. The rock is argillaceous, very homogeneous in grain, and occasionally seamed with calcite. Other outcrops, also belonging to the cretaceous age, are found in various parts of the District. It is very probable that on examination, the formations in the plains would give evidence of frequent alterations of marine with fresh-water sediments. They certainly indicate nothing of the consolidation of older systems. Limestone, intermixed with the tertiary clays and sands of the lower lands, is abundant and very pure; yielding on analysis carbonate of lime (with traces of iron), 93\u00b76 per cent.; insoluble clay, 6\u00b74. Veins of steatite and white fibrous quartz also occur in the District.\n\n**History.**\u2014According to the palm-leaf chronicles, there reigned in Baranathi (Benares), at a time when the duration of human life was 90 millions of years, a descendant of the first Buddha of the present epoch, who had sixteen sons; to the eldest of whom, Tha-m\u00fa-t\u00ed-de-wa, was allotted the country now forming Sandoway District. For him the spirits or Nats built a city, Dwa-ra-wad-d\u00ed, near the modern Sandoway. Many ages later, Sek-kya-wad-d\u00ed, the embryo Gautama Buddha, was King of Baranathi; and to his son, Kan-myin, he gave all the lands inhabited by the Burmese, Shan, and Malay races. Kan-myin came to Dwa-ra-wad-d\u00ed; dispossessed the descendant of Tha-m\u00fa-t\u00ed-de-wa; and was succeeded by kings of his own line, who ruled for a period represented by a unit followed by 140 ciphers. During the reign of Na-rein-da, the last of these monarchs, the country was attacked by the grandsons of a king who ruled in Mo-gaung.\n\nThe legend runs thus:\u2014Arriving at the mouth of the Than-dwe (Sandoway) river, they failed in their attempts to find the city, owing to the devices of its guardian Bi-l\u00fa-ma, or, as some say, to its miraculous power of soaring above the earth in times of danger. At length the guardian, being propitiated, withdrew her protection; and the ten brothers then bound the city to the earth with an iron chain, and divided their conquest in ten shares, making Than-dwe ('iron-bound') their capital. But the eight younger brothers were slain in combat with the people, who appear to have risen against them, and the two elder fled.\nHenceforth Sandoway appears only as a province of the Arakan kingdom, ravaged alternately by the Burmese and Talaings until the conquest of Arakan by the Burmese in 1784. It was then formed into a governorship, and its wun was one of the commanders of the Burmese army which invaded Bengal at the commencement of the first Anglo-Burmese war. The country was ceded to the British by the treaty of Yandabu in 1826; and on the withdrawal of General Morrison's army, one regiment of Native infantry was left at Sandoway. A few years later, the military head-quarters were transferred to Kyaukpyu, and subsequently the small detachment of two companies was also withdrawn.\n\nAntiquities.\u2014On the hills close to Sandoway are three small white-washed pagodas, the An-daw, Nan-daw, and San-daw. The An-daw is said to have been erected in 761 A.D. by King Min-tsek-kyup, to cover a tooth of Gautama. The building is 242 feet in circumference and 63 feet high. The Nan-daw stands on a hill 480 feet above the level of the plain, and is 38 feet high; it is said to have been built in 763 A.D. by Min-bra, to enshrine a rib of Gautama. The San-daw is assigned to Min-nyo-khin (784 A.D.), and covers a hair of Gautama brought from Ceylon. Three times a year pilgrims resort to these pagodas, remaining one day at each temple on each occasion. Two stones inscribed in Sanskrit of the 8th century have been found near the Sandoway river. Silver coins struck by ancient kings of Arakan are occasionally met with, some of which have the dates and names in Burmese characters, whilst others bear Persian or Nagari inscriptions. Celts or stone implements are abundant.\n\nPopulation.\u2014Mountainous and forest-clad, Sandoway District seems to have been always sparsely inhabited, but the increase of population since the British occupation has been proportionately larger than in other parts of Arakan. In 1828, the number of inhabitants was 19,538; by 1852, it had risen to 42,886; in 1872, to 54,725; and in 1881, to 64,010, namely, males 32,706, and females 31,304. Number of villages, 469; occupied houses, 11,639; unoccupied houses, 773; average density of population, 17.66 persons per square mile. Classified according to age, there were\u2014under 15 years, boys 14,058, and girls 13,486; total children, 27,544, or 43 per cent. of the population: 15 years and upwards, males 18,648, and females 17,818; total adults, 36,466, or 57 per cent. of the population.\n\nBuddhists number 56,458; Nat-worshippers, or persons of non-Buddhist indigenous religion, 4888; Muhammadans, 2509; Hindus, 124; and Christians, 31. Taken by language\u2014persons speaking Burmese (including Arakanese) numbered 58,061; Chin, 5045; Karen, 107; Shan, 59; Bengali, 399; Hindustani, 263; and a very few speaking English, Greek, Chinese, Tamil, Telugu, and Manipuri.\nThe Muhammadans are of two classes. The Me-du, who ascribe their origin to members of a colony from near Ava, who originally came as soldiers with the invading Burman army, and who, about 70 or more years ago, were joined by many of their co-religionists who left Burma during a famine. The Kaman, who claim to have come originally from Delhi, and to be descended from the followers of the unfortunate Sh\u00e1h Shuj\u00e1, who was put to death by the King of Arakan, with whom he had sought refuge from his brother Aurangzeb. Neither of these classes differ much from their Buddhist neighbours, except in religion and education, of which they have less. The Hindus are mainly convicts transported from India many years ago, when Sandoway was a convict station. Chin, a race of mountaineers, have long inhabited the north and east, and of late years have spread into the plains. See article Thayet-myo.\n\nThere is (1881) no town in the District with more than 2000 inhabitants, and by far the greater number of villages, namely, 381, have fewer than 200; 80 only having from 200 to 500; 6 from 500 to 1000; and 1 from 1000 to 2000 inhabitants. These are nearly all situated between the sea-coast and the slopes of the Arakan Yomas. The chief places in the District are\u2014Sandoway, the administrative head-quarters, situated on the Sandoway river, and containing the usual public buildings; population (1881) 1901: Taung-gup, on the Taung-gup river, and head-quarters of a township; population 1778: Gwa, a trading village, with a population of 1072; Kyein-ta-li, a small village at the mouth of the river of the same name.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Of the total area of the District, namely, 3667 square miles, only 60 square miles were returned in 1883-84 as cultivable, and about 75 as under actual cultivation. In 1881, the total agricultural population numbered 53,662, or 83.83 per cent. of the District population. Total amount of Government assessment, including local rates and cesses on land, \u00a36441, or an average of 2s. 9\u00bdd. per cultivated acre. The chief crops are rice, sesamum, tobacco, cotton, pepper, sugar-cane, dhani palms, and yams. In 1883-84, the area under the various crops was as follows:\u2014Rice, 36,754 acres; oil-seeds, 981; sugar-cane, 1044; cotton, 336; vegetables, 292; dhani palms, 2355; tobacco, 1874; plantains, 664; mixed fruit-trees, 606; chillies, 320; taungya, or hill gardens, 3986; miscellaneous crops, 896. Land suited for rice yields on an average 940 lbs. per acre; cotton, 480 lbs.; oil-seeds, 400 lbs.; sugar, 1040 lbs.; tobacco, 400 lbs.; and chillies, 240 lbs. Sesamum and cotton are grown principally with rice in taungya or hill gardens. The cultivation of tobacco is extending; the best is grown on the alluvial soil deposited during the south-west monsoon by the torrents of the Yoma range in their short course to the sea. The Cuba plant was introduced by Captain (now Sir A. P.) Phayre and Captain (now\nLieutenant-General) Fytche, and thrives well; but is considered by the natives inferior in flavour to their own tobacco, which is said to have been originally brought from China. Madder is produced near the Gwa, and the cultivation is very profitable; it is exported to Bassein.\n\nAs an almost universal rule, the land in the plains is held by small proprietors directly from the State; the average size of the holdings is 5 acres. In 1883-84, the average rent of land suited for rice was 7s. an acre; oil-seeds, sugar, cotton, tobacco, and chillies, 3s. 3d. Land is not often mortgaged, but very high interest is charged for loans. If a large amount is required, the land is generally made over to the mortgagee for several years on the payment of a lump sum, for which no other interest is charged. Labourers engaged for ploughing receive 2 rupees, or 4s., per acre and their food; and when hired for transplanting or reaping, a bushel of grain per diem. When land is leased the rent is almost invariably paid in kind, and averages one-third of the yield. In 1883-84, the average prices per maund of 80 lbs. were\u2014cotton, 12s.; rice, 5s.; sugar, 8s.; salt, 2s. 3d.; tobacco, \u00a31, 8s.; oil-seeds, 8s.; chillies, 24s.; plough bullocks, \u00a33, 10s. each; sheep and goats, \u00a31 each; buffaloes, \u00a34, 10s. The wages of skilled labour were from 1s. to 1s. 6d., and of unskilled labour, 9d. a day. In 1883-84, the agricultural stock and implements consisted of\u2014Cows and bullocks, 11,777; buffaloes, 25,147; pigs, 2355; sheep and goats, 484; horses and ponies, 32; elephants, 7; ploughs, 14,592; carts, 790; boats, 1692.\n\nManufactures, etc.\u2014The most important manufacture is thatch from the leaves of the dhani (Nipa) palm, which is in great demand in Akyab and Kyauk-pyu, as well as locally. Cotton cloth and silk dresses are woven by the women in almost every house. The silk used is obtained from the southern township, where silkworms are bred, and from the valley of the Irawadi. There is a large export trade with Akyab, Kyauk-pyu, and Bassein in rice, tobacco, sesamum, plantains, salt, salt-fish, ngat-pi or fish paste, and boats. The imports consist of piece-goods, cotton twist, betel-nuts, crockery, and hardware. In 1883-84, the total length of water communication in Sandoway District was 130 miles; of roads, 20\u00bd miles.\n\nAdministration.\u2014Under Burmese rule, the regular revenue was derived from transit dues, a poll tax, and a tax on land. Five baskets (each holding 40 lbs.) of rice in the husk were taken for each pair of buffaloes used, and half a basket was claimed by the keeper of the royal granary as 'wastage.' But there was no fixed rate, and the governors often exacted more. In 1828, it was calculated that every head of a family paid \u00a31, 15s. a year to the Government, whilst the annual cost of living for four persons was only \u00a34, 4s. In 1851, the revenue amounted to \u00a38362; in 1871, to \u00a311,744, including local funds. In 1877-78, the imperial revenue was \u00a314,423, of which \u00a35685 was land revenue;\nthe local revenue was \u00a3580. The incidence of taxation of all kinds was 3s. 0\u00bdd. per head. In 1883\u201384, the gross revenue was \u00a313,978, of which \u00a36749 was land revenue. In Burmese times, the country was administered by a wun or governor, under whom were the sit-ke, myo-uk thugyi, and other subordinates. It appears from the records at Sandoway that the thugyi generally levied their demands thus:\u2014 From married people, well off, with families, bond servants, cattle, etc., \u00a31, 14s.; married people not so well off, \u00a31, 10s.; married people dependent upon their own labour, or too old for work, and newly married people with means, 18s.; newly married people with little or no substance, 7s. Plungy\u00eds (priests), the maimed and infirm, Government servants, and bachelors, were exempt from taxation.\n\nFor some time after the British occupation, the country was in a disturbed state. It has now settled down into a peaceful District, administered by a Deputy Commissioner with extensive judicial powers, who is the chief revenue authority under the Commissioner of the Division. Under him are the extra-Assistant Commissioners. The regular police consisted in 1883\u201384 of 196 officers and men, or about 1 policeman to every 18 square miles or every 327 inhabitants. There is a jail at Sandoway town; the daily average of prisoners in 1883 was 15. The total cost was \u00a3419. The hospital and civil dispensary, also at the head-quarters town, gave relief in 1883 to 83 in-door and 5889 out-door patients. Little education has, till lately, been given except by the Buddhist monks. The Census of 1881 showed 2371 boys and 83 girls as under instruction, besides 9051 males and 105 females able to read and write, but not under instruction. The Muhammadans were still more backward; in towns the children are better instructed, and in some cases learn both Arabic and Hindust\u00e1ni. A middle-class school was opened in 1876, and had 44 pupils on the rolls at the end of the year, and 116 in 1883\u201384. Total number of schools in 1883\u201384 under public management, indigenous and private, 20; number of scholars, 683.\n\nClimate.\u2014From November to February the dews are exceedingly heavy, and the nights very chilly, the terrestrial radiation thermometer often recording only 38\u00b0 F. From February to May, dense fogs rise during the evenings, and the wind blows from the west. Towards the middle of May, storms of thunder and lightning are of frequent occurrence. The average rainfall registered for the twenty years ending 1881 was 212\u00b702 inches. Total rainfall in 1883, 223\u00b718 inches. The maximum temperature was 103\u00b0 F., and the minimum 61\u00b0 F. The town of Sandoway is considered by some to be the healthiest place in Arakan. The prevalent diseases of the District are agues and fevers. [For further information regarding Sandoway, see the British Burma Gazetteer, compiled by authority, vol. ii. pp. 606\u2013626; the British\nBurma Census Report for 1881; and the several Administration and Departmental Reports of the Government of Burma.]\n\nSandoway.\u2014Chief town and head-quarters of Sandoway District, Arakan Division, Lower Burma; situated in lat. $18^\\circ 27' 35''$ N., and long. $94^\\circ 24' 36''$ E., on the Sandoway river, about 15 miles from its mouth, but only $4\\frac{1}{2}$ miles from the sea in a direct line. The town lies in a basin about 12 miles long by 1 broad, which is cultivated with rice, and surrounded by hills, the only outlets being those through which the river flows. The larger portion of the town, which is laid out regularly, lies on the left bank of the river; whilst on the right side is a long straggling suburb, buried in trees, and presenting the appearance of an independent village. It contains the court-houses, police station, market, jail, hospital, dispensary, and circuit-house.\n\nSandoway is a very ancient town, and is often mentioned in Arakanese history as the capital of a kingdom, or more probably a petty chieftainship. Its original name was Dwa-ra-wad-d\u00ed; but according to a current legend it was called Than-dwe (by which appellation it is now known to the Burmese and Arakanese, Sandoway being an English corruption), from its having been miraculously fastened to the earth by iron chains.\n\nAfter the capture of Arakan town in 1824, a force was sent southwards to attack Ramri and Sandoway. General MacBean reached Sandoway on the 30th of April, and occupied the town without resistance. After the cessation of the war, it remained for some years the head-quarters of the troops garrisoning Arakan. The garrison has now been altogether withdrawn. When the British first took the town the number of inhabitants was found to be 4500. In 1877-78, the population was returned at 1617; and in 1881, 1901.\n\nSandoway carries on a small coasting trade in rice, vegetables, etc., and a land traffic in silk and other piece-goods with Prome and Bassein over the Arakan Mountains valued at \u00a32000 per annum. Owing to the numerous creeks intersecting the coast, boats can get as far as Akyab without entering the open sea. In the neighbourhood of Sandoway are the three pagodas of An-daw, Nan-daw, and San-daw, to which pilgrims resort three times a year, spending one day on each occasion at each shrine.\n\nSandoway.\u2014River in Sandoway District, Arakan Division, Lower Burma. It rises in the Arakan Hills, and, flowing west-north-west, falls into the sea in about lat. $18^\\circ 31' N$. About 15 miles up the river is Sandoway town, which can be reached by large boats. The anchorage inside the mouth is from 5 to 6 fathoms; the tide is felt for a short distance above Sandoway town. About 50 miles from the entrance is a sulphuretted hydrogen spring in the bed of the river, the water of which attains a heat of $110^\\circ F$.\nSandoway Myoma.\u2014Township in Sandoway District, Lower Burma, sometimes called the central township. Bounded on the west by the Bay of Bengal. It comprises 14 revenue circles; chief town, Sandoway, on the Sandoway river. In 1881, the cultivated area was 20,667 acres; products\u2014rice, tobacco, sesamum, cotton, pepper, sugar-cane, cocoa-nuts, hemp, and miscellaneous garden stuff. Exports\u2014agricultural produce; imports\u2014European cotton and woollen goods, silk goods from Prome and Bassein, and earth-oil and lacquered ware from the latter District. Good communication by boat.\n\nSandru.\u2014Pass in Bashahr (Bussahir) State, Punjab, across the Himalayan range in Kunawar. Lat. 31\u00b0 24' N., long. 78\u00b0 2' E. (Thornton). Said to be open during only two months of the year. Elevation above sea-level, about 16,000 feet.\n\nSandur (Sundoor, Sandhur?).\u2014Native State within the British District of Bellary, Madras Presidency, lying between 14\u00b0 58' and 15\u00b0 12' N. lat., and between 76\u00b0 28' and 76\u00b0 43' E. long. Area, 164 square miles, of which a large proportion is hill jungle. The State is bounded on the south by the Kudligi taluk, and on all other sides, save a small portion bordering on Mysore State, by the Hospet taluk of Bellary District. The tract is elliptical in shape, stretching from north-west to south-east, and is almost entirely shut in by hills, which isolate it from the neighbouring country. Population of the State (1881) 10,532. The annual revenue from all sources somewhat exceeds \u00a34500.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014One chain of hills on the western limits of the State is known as the Sandur or Ramandrug range (q.v.); and from the north, the Timmappa Hills run down to form its eastern boundary. These are crossed by three principal passes. On the east, the Yettinhatti or Bhimagandi gh\u00e1t connects the State with Bellary; on the south-west, through the Oblagandi gorge, runs an excellent cart-road for through traffic. The R\u00e1magandi valley between the two main converging ranges is the northern entrance, and has a good road to Hospet. The principal elevations are the R\u00e1mandrug, Kum\u00e1rasw\u00e1mi, and Kombaravu plateaux. All these attain an elevation of about 3000 feet. The sides of the hills are in most places forest-clad, but indiscriminate felling and charcoal-burning have done much to keep down the more valuable timbers.\n\nSeveral streams water the State. These, for the most part, find an outlet in the Sandur river or N\u00e1ri N\u00e1l\u00e1 through the Yettinhatti gorge, and feed the Daroji tank in Hospet. On the hills, tigers, leopards, hogs, porcupines, bears, sambhar deer, and jungle sheep are found. The prevailing rock is a chloritic slate, often highly impregnated with oxide of iron, and crested in many places with mural ridges of ferruginous quartz rock, tinted with a variety of colours, from a steel-grey to a deep\nliver-brown. This rock often forms whole hillocks, always, however, overlying the slate. On the hills generally, iron-ore is obtained. It is often of a rich quality, easily got at, and usually of a friable description. On R\u00e1mandrug, various coloured clays are procurable without difficulty. The prevailing soil in the valley is a rich heavy loam, interspersed here and there with patches of black cotton-soil. In various parts, lime is obtained near the surface, chiefly in nodular form. The ascent to the Kum\u00e1rasw\u00e1mi pagoda passes over an extensive bed of lava conglomerate; and the same feature characterizes part of the R\u00e1mandrug range.\n\nHistory. \u2014 The founder of the Sand\u00far family was a Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 named Malaj\u00ed R\u00e1o Ghorpae, an officer in the Bij\u00e1pur army, whose son Bir\u00e1j\u00ed entered the service of Sivaji the Great. The State had been previously held by a Bidar Polig\u00e1r, but Bir\u00e1j\u00ed\u2019s son Sidaj\u00ed took Sand\u00far from the Bedars, and his conquest was confirmed to him and his heirs by Sambhaji, the successor of Sivaji. Sidaj\u00ed died in 1715, and was succeeded in Sand\u00far by his second son, Gop\u00e1l R\u00e1o, whose fate is involved in obscurity. All that is known is, that Sand\u00far was taken by Haidar \u00c1l\u00ed some time after his capture of Gooty (Guti) in 1779; that Haidar began, and Tip\u00fa completed, the fort; and that Gop\u00e1l R\u00e1o\u2019s son, Siva R\u00e1o, was killed in battle in 1785, in a vain attempt to recover his patrimony.\n\nIn 1790, Siva R\u00e1o\u2019s brother, Venkat R\u00e1o, acting on behalf of his nephew Sidaj\u00ed, expelled Tip\u00fa\u2019s garrison, but did not attempt to occupy Sand\u00far till the fall of Seringapatam. The Peshw\u00e1 then claimed the State as his own, and presented it to Yaswant R\u00e1o Ghorpae, a distinguished officer of Sindhia\u2019s army, who belonged to the same family as the former holders. Yaswant R\u00e1o did not enter into possession; and the widow of Sidaj\u00ed, who died in 1796, adopted Siva R\u00e1o, a son of Khandi R\u00e1o, the younger brother of Yaswant R\u00e1o. The Peshw\u00e1 made an unsuccessful attempt upon Sand\u00far in 1815; and at his request in 1817, the British Government, in conformity with the provisions of the treaty of Bassein, sent a force under Sir Thomas Munro to reduce it. In October of that year, the fort and State were surrendered. On Sir Thomas Munro\u2019s recommendation, Siva R\u00e1o received as compensation a j\u00e1gir of \u00a31000.\n\nIn 1818, however, after the downfall of the Peshw\u00e1\u2019s Government, Siva R\u00e1o was restored to his State; and in 1826 he received a sanad from Government confirming the lands of Sand\u00far to him and his heirs free of any pecuniary demands. Siva R\u00e1o was succeeded in 1840 by a nephew named Venkat R\u00e1o, who died in 1861. His eldest son, Siva Shan Mukha R\u00e1o, being then a minor, did not receive the sanad till 1863. On the 24th January 1876, Lord Northbrook, then Governor-General, conferred on him the title of R\u00e1j\u00e1, as a hereditary distinction\nto be assumed by his successors on formal recognition of their succession. Siva Shan Mukha R\u00e1o died in May 1878, and was succeeded by his half-brother R\u00e1m Chendra Vittala R\u00e1o, the present R\u00e1j\u00e1, to whom the sanad was granted in February 1879. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 has the entire management of the revenue and police of his State, and the duty of administering civil justice. In the administration of criminal justice, he is required to refer all cases calling for capital punishment for the orders of the Madras Government. The Collector of Bellary acts as Government Agent. The chief holds a sanad conferring rights of adoption, granted by the British Government.\n\nIn the office of the Agent of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 at Sand\u00far is a copper-plate document evidencing the grant of land in in\u00e1m to village carpenters, and the building of villages by a \u2018Narpati\u2019 king.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The population of Sand\u00far State in 1865 was 12,962. At the Census of 1871 it was returned as 14,994; and the Madras Administration Report for 1877\u201378 gives the number as 14,999. It is probable that this estimate was considerably in excess of the actual population, as the Census was taken a few days previous to the Kum\u00e1rasw\u00e1mi festival, when there was a considerable influx of strangers. The Census of 1881 gives the population as 10,532. The decrease of nearly 30 per cent. since 1871 is due to the loss caused by death and emigration during the famine of 1876\u201378, and the subsequent removal of the military d\u00e9p\u00f4t from R\u00e1mandrug. According to the Census of 1881, males numbered 5298, and females 5234, occupying 2173 houses in 23 villages. Hindus numbered 9000; Muhammadans, 1521; and Christians, 11. In caste and race, the people are identical with those of the surrounding District of Bellary. On the plateaux there is a hill tribe of hunters, called Bedars, divided into two clans. They are a healthy and industrious people; and although possessing peculiar customs, they are probably Dravidian Hindus, and in no way connected with the aboriginal tribes, such as Malay\u00e1lis, etc.\n\nPlaces of Interest.\u2014The two places of most interest in the State are the important sanatorium of Ram\u00e1nmalai, situated 3150 feet above the sea, and used chiefly as a convalescent d\u00e9p\u00f4t for troops; and the temple of Kum\u00e1rasw\u00e1mi, of which Newbold gives the following description:\u2014\u2018It is situated near the basin of a ravine, not far from the summit of the south-west part of the range of hills that enclose the valley; and after an ascent of 4 miles. The temple is neither large nor magnificent, but has an air of antiquity, of which its whitewashed exterior and gilded cupola cannot entirely divest it. The gopuram faces the east; on the left of the entrance is the shrine of the goddess P\u00e1rvati, consort of Siva; to the west is the image of her son Kum\u00e1rasw\u00e1mi, the presiding genius of the place; and to the right stands the shrine of the destroyer Siva. In front is a square pool called \u201cAguste\nTirtha.' In front of the gopuram is a small octangular column of hewn stone, at the foot of which lie three trunkless stone heads. The largest is that of the giant Tarakasam, slain by Kum\u00e1rasw\u00e1mi. The great festival occurs triennially, and at this the number of pilgrims has latterly amounted to 25,000 or 30,000; the temple revenue averages from 15,000 to 20,000 rupees (say \u00a31500 to \u00a32000) annually. A Shasanam in old Kanarese is still preserved, which grants the endowment of the temple. It was given in S. 615 (713 A.D.) by a king of the Marala dynasty, named Bijala N\u00e1yak.' The climate of Kum\u00e1rasw\u00e1mi is described as very agreeable, although, owing to its easterly position, it is not so cool as that of R\u00e1mandrug.\n\nRevenue.\u2014The revenue of the State is at present about \u00a33700, of which \u00a31800 is derived from land. The land revenue includes grants of land to dependants and service lands; other lands to the annual value of \u00a31300 are alienated. It has been the policy of the present R\u00e1j\u00e1 to increase the security of the land tenures, and render them permanent. The peasants may cut wood for all agricultural purposes free of payment; nor are they liable to be charged for firewood which they themselves carry home. The poorer classes were formerly permitted to cut firewood and grass in the jungles, and to sell it in the b\u00e1z\u00e1r free of tax; but under recent regulations each head-load of firewood brought for sale is subject to a tax of 3 pies (or 3\u00bdd.). In 1882, an arrangement was entered into between the R\u00e1j\u00e1 and the Government, according to which 40,000 acres of forest land were leased to the latter for 25 years at 4 annas (6d.) per acre per annum, reserving to Government the option of renewing the lease on the same terms at the end of that period, and every succeeding period of 25 years.\n\nThe average annual rainfall of Sand\u00far is about 36 inches. The chief village is Sand\u00far; population (1881) 4096, occupying 793 houses.\n\nSand\u00far (Sundoor, or more properly R\u00e1mandrug).\u2014Hills in Bellary District, Madras. A range of hills about 15 miles long, running from south-east to north-west, ending abruptly near Hospet. This range forms the greater part of the western boundary of the Native State of Sandur, dividing it from the Hospet t\u00e1luk. R\u00e1mandrug, 3150 feet above the sea, is the principal peak, and was selected as far back as 1846 for the sanitarium of RAMANMALAI. The range consists of gneiss much weathered. The upper part of R\u00e1mandrug is clay ironstone, and the slopes consist of a variety of schistose rocks containing manganese and antimony. Tigers are found in these hills, and much useful wood comes from them.\n\nSandw\u00edp (Sundeep).\u2014Island in the Bay of Bengal; situated off the cost of Chittagong and No\u00e1kh\u00e1li, and forming part of the latter District. Lat. 22\u00b0 24' to 22\u00b0 37' N., long. 91\u00b0 22' to 91\u00b0 35' E. The largest of many chars formed by the Meghna as it enters the sea. For long, a process\nof diluvion went on in the south of Sandwip, but the soil re-formed and reappeared in 1865 as the Kali char, many miles long, lying parallel with the south face of the island, at a distance of 2 or 3 miles. This char already acts as a bar to protect Sandwip from further diluvion, and will eventually, in all probability, become attached to it by the silting up of the intermediate channel.\n\nSandwip early attracted the notice of travellers. C\u00e6sar Frederick, the Venetian (1565), described the inhabitants as 'Moors,' and stated that the island was one of the most fertile places in the country, densely populated, and well cultivated. He mentions the extraordinary cheapness of provisions; and adds that 200 ships were laden yearly with salt, and that such was the abundance of materials for shipbuilding, that the Sultan of Constantinople found it cheaper to have his vessels built here than at Alexandria. Purchas (circa 1620) states that most of the inhabitants near the shore were Muhammadans; and there are several mosques on Sandwip Island two hundred years old. Sir Thomas Herbert (circa 1625) bears testimony to the fertility of the island, which he describes as one of the fairest and most fruitful spots in all India. The cocoa-nut palm flourishes in Sandwip, and the nuts are exported to Chittagong and Akyab. Sugar-cane is also cultivated to a small extent.\n\nThe island of Sandwip figured conspicuously in the contests of the 17th century between the Arakanese, Muhammadans, and Portuguese (see Chittagong District), and during that period numerous forts were erected. In one of these, the Muhammadan troops took refuge in March 1609, when the Portuguese landed on the island. But the fort was besieged and captured, and the defenders put to the sword. In 1616, Sandwip was taken from the Portuguese by the Arakanese. In 1665, Shaista Khan, the Muhammadan Nawab of Bengal, determined to reconquer the island. An interesting account of his expedition, by the French traveller Bernier, was translated in the Calcutta Review for 1871, and is quoted in The Statistical Account of Bengal, vol. vi. pp. 243-246.\n\nUntil 1822, the island formed part of Chittagong, but in that year it was made over to the newly formed District of Noakhali. It had, from the time when it came under British administration (1760), formed a constant source of disquiet. It afforded an asylum for the refuse of the river Districts from Dacca southwards, and had a mixed population of Hindus, Muhammadans, and Maghs, who formed agricultural colonies, fishing settlements, piratical villages, and robber communities. The subordinate tenants kept up a bitter quarrel with the landholder-in-chief, and every class seemed to have a grudge against the rest, and some complaint to make to Government. But the firm administration of the British officials gradually produced its\neffect. A Commissioner was appointed to measure and partition the island. His appearance, however, was at first only the signal for new disorders. On the one hand, he complained of 'obstructions and difficulties' thrown in the way of executing his duty; on the other hand, the talukdars forwarded a bitter petition and lament. An enterprising native gentleman proposed, in May 1785, to relieve the officials of further difficulty by taking Sandwip in farm. But the Government was resolved to have the work thoroughly done, and rejected his offer. Accordingly, the troublesome island was placed under the direct management of the Collector, who was ordered to conduct a land settlement.\n\nThe administration of justice in Sandwip was formerly under the authority of an officer called a faujdar, resident in the island. But from a Report (dated September 1779) by Mr. Duncan, specially deputed to Sandwip, it appears that when Government ceased to maintain a fortress on the island, the faujdar was no longer retained, and justice was administered by an inferior officer with the title of darog\u00e1. This official had not, however, uncontrolled jurisdiction. From the year 1760, if not from an earlier date, he was entirely under the authority of the naib ahad-d\u00e1r. It was the duty of the darog\u00e1 and his assistants to prepare cases for hearing; and on fixed days in each week the naib ahad-d\u00e1r would sit in his court of justice, attended by the darog\u00e1s, k\u00e1n\u00edngos, and zamind\u00e1rs, to dispose of all cases brought before him. 'This court,' writes Mr. Duncan, 'took cognizance of all matters, civil and criminal\u2014its jurisdiction being only restrained as to matters of revenue, the cognizance of which rested with the ahad-d\u00e1r in his separate capacity. In matters of debt, the court retained the fourth part of the sum in litigation, and enacted discretionary fines for theft, gang-robbery (d\u00e1k\u00e1ti), fornication, assaults, and the like.'\n\nAmong the miscellaneous inquiries conducted by Mr. Duncan in 1779, was one relating to complaints of slaves, or persons reported to be slaves, against their masters. 'This unfortunate race of mankind,' says Mr. Duncan, 'bears in Sandwip a larger proportion to the other inhabitants than perhaps in any other District in the Province; there is hardly a householder, however indigent, who has not at least one slave, and the majority have many in their families. Their number also very soon increases by marriage, in which they are encouraged by their masters, the custom of the country being such that a free woman, on marrying a male slave, reduces herself and her family to be the perpetual slaves of her husband's master, who continues ever after to retain them in the same bondage.' One man alone was said to possess more than 1500 slaves. The principal cause assigned by Mr. Duncan for the great extent to which slavery prevailed in Sandwip, was 'the extreme cheapness and abundance of grain in\nthe island, so that as often as there is any scarcity in Dacca District, it attracts people to Sandwip, where it has been common for many of them to sell themselves and their posterity for maintenance.' Although Mr. Duncan in 1779 set at liberty only 15 slaves and their families, yet none of his proceedings created more general apprehension than his taking cognizance of this particular grievance, because all the principal people were immediately interested.\n\nFrom its low-lying position, Sandwip is peculiarly exposed to inundation from storm-waves, and suffered severely in loss of life and property by the cyclones of 1864 and 1876. The calamity of the latter year was the severest on record. The following account of the inundation is quoted from a report by Mr. Pellew, the Collector of No\u00e1kh\u00e1l\u00ed:\u2014'The people in the villages on the south-western coast stated that the inundation commenced with a wave at least 6 feet high, which burst over the land from the south-east. Very shortly afterwards, another wave, 6 feet higher, came from the south-west. These waves came suddenly, just like the bore, mounting up and curling over. The second wave is described as lifting the roofs of the houses, and whirling the contents\u2014human beings, furniture, etc.\u2014violently outside. The mat walls, with their wooden posts, were swept away, the latter being either broken off short or wrested out of the ground. All this was done suddenly; people described it as occurring in one second of time. Behind each wave the water did not fall again, but remained, so that after the second wave there was 12 feet of water over the land.\n\n'In the centre of the island the water came up less suddenly. The Government Pleader at Harishpur was taking refuge from the storm in his new office. Suddenly an alarm was raised that the water was coming. He got on the wooden dais, but the water immediately covered this. He then went up to his neck in water, along a raised path, to the bank of his tank, which is about 12 feet high. He told me that the rising of the water did not take longer than two minutes from first to last, and that he was only just in time. The bank of the tank was not more than 10 yards from his office.'\n\nIn many villages whole families were swept away, and in some of the chars the entire population was destroyed. 'In the village of Nay\u00e1masti,' writes Mr. Pellew, 'one man was the sole survivor of thirteen; four men were the survivors of a household of twenty-five. The women have perished in immense numbers. Most of the men who remain are wifeless. In Kang\u00e1li Char, the Sub-Inspector of Police found nothing but two wild buffaloes alive, and the corpses of men, cows, and buffaloes. In Char Maulavi, out of 177 people, 137 died.'\n\nFor the first few days after this cyclone of 1876, there were several\nattempts at plundering, and demoralization prevailed among the low Muhammadan population. Men, in gangs and singly, armed with cudgels, bills, and hatchets, were, the Collector reported, wandering about the inundated tracts, and breaking open and looting all they could lay their hands upon, whether under the care of owners or not. This lawlessness was, however, rapidly suppressed; and the people soon returned to the sites of their former houses, and busied themselves in drying their grain and in saving what they could of their property. Throughout the devastated tracts, 'the demeanour of those who really bore the brunt of the storm was,' Sir Richard Temple states, 'marked by that enduring fortitude under suffering which distinguishes the native character.'\n\nThe number of deaths was officially estimated at 40,000, out of a total population of 87,016. Cholera set in soon after the cyclone had passed over. Although a large medical staff was immediately despatched to the District, the epidemic continued to rage to such an extent, that when Mr. Pellew visited the Sandw\u00edp islands, the mortality from the plague threatened in some places to exceed that from the storm itself. The returns for thirty-three police-beats in South Sandw\u00edp, with a population of 10,855 souls, gave the deaths by drowning as 1063, whereas those from cholera in the same tract had by December 1876 amounted to 764. The pollution of the tanks and watercourses, both by the salt-water inundation and by the corpses of men and the carcasses of cattle, added to the other evils resulting from the cyclone; while the stench from the dead tainting the air throughout the inundated tract aggravated the plague of cholera. Nearly all the scavenger animals\u2014jackals, dogs, and even vultures\u2014perished by the storm and the wave; and for weeks after the inundation, the land was covered with the dead bodies of men and cattle, preserved by the salt-water from rapid decomposition. The total population of Sandw\u00edp Island in 1881 was returned at 72,467, showing a decrease since 1872 of 14,549, or 16\u00b772 per cent.\n\nS\u00e1ngakher\u00e1.\u2014Village in Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d tahsil, Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Central Provinces. Population (1881) 2957, namely, Hindus, 2592; Muhammadans, 118; and non-Hindu aborigines, 247.\n\nS\u00e1ngala.\u2014Ruins in Jhang District, Punjab; standing on a small rocky hill, upon the border of Gujr\u00e1nw\u00e1la District; now known as S\u00e1nglaw\u00e1la Tiba, and identified by General Cunningham with the S\u00e1kala of the Br\u00e1hmans, the S\u00e1g\u00e1l of Buddhism, and the S\u00e1ngala of Alexander's historians. The hill rises to a height of 215 feet above the surrounding plain on its north side, and slopes southward till it ends in an abrupt bank only 32 feet in height, crowned in early times by a brick wall, traces of which still exist. The whole intervening area is strewn with large antique bricks, great quantities of which have\nbeen removed during recent years. An extensive swamp covers the approach on the south and east, the least defensible quarters, with a general depth of 3 feet in the rains, but dry during the summer. This must have been a large lake in the days of Alexander, which has since silted up by detritus from the hill above. On the north-east side of the hill, General Cunningham found the remains of two considerable buildings, with bricks of enormous size. Close by, stands an old well, lately cleared out by wandering tribes. On the north-west side, about 1000 feet distant, rises a low ridge of rock, known as Munda-ka-pura, 30 feet in height, also covered by brick remains.\n\nThe earliest notice of the locality occurs in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, where S\u0101kala figures as the capital of the M\u00e1dras or J\u00e1takas, and the B\u0101hikas, situated upon the Apag\u00e1 rivulet, west of the Ir\u0101vati or R\u00e1vi, and approached from the east by pleasant paths through the Pilu forest. The neighbourhood bears the name of M\u00e1dra-des, or country of the M\u00e1dras, to the present day. The Apag\u00e1 rivulet has been identified by General Cunningham with the Ayak nadi, a small stream which has its rise in the J\u00e1mmu hills north-east of Si\u00e1lkot, but which is now quite dry in the neighbourhood of S\u00e1ngala.\n\nIn Buddhist legends, the city reappears as S\u00e1gal, whither seven kings made their way to carry off Prabh\u00e1vati, the wife of King Kusa. That monarch, however, met them outside the gates, mounted upon an elephant, and shouted with so loud a voice that his words were heard over the whole world, and the seven kings fled away in terror. Arrian, Curtius, and Diodorus all notice S\u00e1ngala, \u2018a great city, defended not only by a wall, but by a swamp,\u2019 which was deep enough to drown several of the inhabitants who attempted to swim across. Alexander seems to have turned out of his direct line of march to punish the Kath\u00e6ans of S\u00e1ngala, who had withheld their allegiance. He stormed the outpost of Munda-ka-pura, crowded with fugitives from other cities, and then, breaching the walls by means of a mine, captured the town by assault. Hiuen Tsiang, the Chinese Buddhist pilgrim, who visited S\u00e1kala in 630 A.D., found the fortifications in ruins, but traced their foundations for a circuit of $3\\frac{1}{2}$ miles. In the midst of the remains, a small portion of the ancient city, 1 mile in circuit, was still inhabited, and contained a Buddhist monastery with 100 monks, and two stupas, one of them founded by the famous Emperor Asoka. The accurate details of the Chinese traveller have been principally instrumental in settling the identity of S\u00e1nglaw\u00e1la Tiba with the historical site.\n\nSangam.\u2014Anicut and village in Nellore District, Madras Presidency; situated on the Penner river, 38 miles from the sea and 20 miles above the anicut at Nellore town. The object of the anicut is to extend irrigation along the northern bank of the Penner, commanding an area of 220 square miles. This tract of country already contains many\ntanks, and is partially irrigated by cuts from the Penner. The construction of the anicut will render certain the existing irrigation, and will largely increase it. Present irrigation, 44,053 acres; estimated increase, 49,947 acres; total, 94,000 acres. From the anicut, a main channel, leading from a head sluice on the north bank of the river, will supply two large existing reservoirs, namely the Kanigiri and Duvur tanks. From the former, the irrigation channels will be taken off.\n\nWhen finished, the anicut will be 4290 feet in length, or nearly three times the length of the Penner anicut at Nellore. Its crest will be 7 feet above the deep bed of the river, or 105 feet above mean sea-level. The head sluice (which was finished in 1884) has 21 vents of 6 feet span, and is designed to carry 4800 cubic feet of water per second (when the water in the river is flush with the anicut crest). The water will be distributed in the following proportion to the reservoirs:\u2014 Kanigiri tank, cubic feet per second, 4576\u00b75; Duvur tank, cubic feet per second, 223\u00b75. The present capacity of the Kanigiri tank is to be greatly enlarged. The total capacity of the two reservoirs will ultimately be \u2014 Kanigiri tank, 6419 millions of cubic feet; Duvur tank, 1043 millions of cubic feet; total, 7462 millions of cubic feet. When finished, the Kanigiri tank will be the largest reservoir in the Madras Presidency.\n\nIt is estimated that the works will be completed in 1889-90. The estimate of the work amounts to \u00a3356,905, and was sanctioned by the Secretary of State in February 1881. It is anticipated that, on completion of the works, the annual revenue will amount to \u00a323,800. The estimate of annual working expenses is \u00a35026, and the net revenue should therefore be \u00a318,774, or 5\u00b726 per cent. on the total capital.\n\nSangam village is situated on the north bank of the Penner river, 20 miles above Nellore town. Population (1881) 1212, occupying 250 houses.\n\n**Sangameshwar.** \u2014 Sub-division of Ratn\u00e1giri District, Bombay Presidency. Area, 557 square miles. Population (1881) 104,640, namely, males 50,379, and females 54,261, occupying 20,434 houses in 179 villages. Hindus number 99,249; Muhammadans, 4778; and \u2018others,\u2019 613. The chief river is the Sh\u00e1stri, which cuts the Sub-division nearly in half. Fair amount of alluvial soil in the river valleys, yielding average crops of rice and pulse. Almost all the rest of the Sub-division is crumbled trap. The area of actual cultivation in 1877-78 was 20,423 acres; cereals and millets occupied 19,136 acres; pulses, 736 acres; oil-seeds, 467 acres; fibres, 28 acres; and miscellaneous crops, 56 acres. In 1883 the Sub-division contained 1 civil and 2 criminal courts; police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), 7; regular police, 59 men. Land revenue (1878), \u00a312,620. Head-quarters, since 1878, at Deorukh.\n(Devrukh); population (1876) 2660; not separately returned in the Census Report of 1881.\n\n**Sangameshwar.**\u2014Old head-quarters of Sangameshwar taluk, Ratnagiri District, Bombay Presidency; situated on the Shastri river, about 20 miles from the coast. Lat. 17\u00b0 9' N., and long. 73\u00b0 36' E. Population (1877) 2475; not separately returned in the Census Report of 1881. The river, which 35 years ago was navigable for the largest vessels to the Sangameshwar quay, is now impassable six miles lower down. Trade in grain, piece-goods, and salt fish. During the famine of 1877\u201378, 1440 tons of grain were forwarded from Bombay through Sangameshwar to the Deccan. Early in 1878, 55 houses were burnt; and a few weeks later (March 16th) a disastrous conflagration completely destroyed the Sub-divisional offices and 75 private houses. On the destruction of the public offices, the head-quarters of Sangameshwar Sub-division were moved to the more central and convenient village of Deorukh (Devrukh).\n\n**Sangamner.**\u2014Sub-division of Ahmadnagar District, Bombay Presidency. Area, 708 square miles; greatest length, 40 miles; greatest breadth, 30 miles. Population (1872) 68,765; (1881) 68,357, namely, males 34,770, and females 33,587, occupying 11,767 houses, in 1 town and 151 villages. Hindus number 63,488; Muhammadans, 3728; and 'others,' 1141. The Sub-division is divided into three distinct portions by the two mountain ranges which traverse it in a parallel direction. The chief rivers are the Pravara and the Mula. The Pravara flows in the valley between the two mountain ranges. With the exception of irrigation from the Ojhar canal, garden cultivation is carried on chiefly by means of wells. A large dam of solid masonry, 830 feet long with a maximum height of 29 feet, was built in 1873 across the rocky bed of the Pravara close to the village of Ojhar-Khurd. Total cost of the dam, together with the head-works, about \u00a36000. The canal which leads the water from the work is on the north side of the river; total area irrigated from the 17 miles which lie in the Sangamner Sub-division, 2227 acres in 1881. Irrigation rates vary from 2s. to 16s. per acre. The area under actual cultivation in 1881\u201382 was 204,020 acres; cereals and millets occupied 197,190 acres, of which 157,823 acres were under spiked millet (Pennisetum typhoideum); pulses, 4764 acres; oil-seeds, 662 acres; fibres, 11 acres; and miscellaneous crops, 1393 acres. The manufactures are cotton and silk cloth, turbans, woollen blankets, bangles, and saltpetre. Of the 2100 looms in the Sub-division, 2000 are in the town of Sangamner. In 1883 the Sub-division contained 2 civil and 2 criminal courts; police circle (thanda), 1; regular police, 44 men; village watch (chaukidars), 189. Land revenue, \u00a37120.\n\n**Sangamner.**\u2014Chief town of the Sangamner Sub-division of\nAhmadnagar District, Bombay Presidency; situated 49 miles north-west of Ahmadnagar city, in lat. $19^\\circ 34' 30''$ N., and long. $74^\\circ 16' 10''$ E. Population (1881) 8796. Hindus numbered 7079; Muhammadans, 1603; Jains, 104; Christians, 7; and 'others,' 3. Besides the ordinary Sub-divisional revenue and police offices, Sangamner has an Assistant Collector's bungalow, post-office, dispensary, and four schools; markets on Wednesdays and Saturdays. Municipality, established in 1860, had in 1883\u201384 an income of \u00a3705; incidence of taxation per head of population, 1s. 4d. Brisk trade; number of looms, 2000.\n\n**Sanganer.**\u2014Town in Jaipur State, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na; situated on the bank of the Am\u00e1n-i-Sh\u00e1h river, 7 miles south-west of Jaipur city, and 3 miles from the Sanganer station on the R\u00e1jput\u00e1na-M\u00e1lw\u00e1 State Railway. Its principal features of interest are temples and Jain edifices, one of which is said to be over a thousand years old. Celebrated for dyeing and printing of cotton stuffs.\n\n**Sangarh.**\u2014Northern tahsil of Dera Gh\u00e1zi Kh\u00e1n District, Punjab; consisting of a narrow strip of land between the Sul\u00e1im\u00e1n mountains and the Indus. Area, 628 square miles; towns and villages, 136; houses, 8389. Population (1881) 51,779, namely, males 27,730, and females 24,049; average density of population, 82 persons per square mile. Muhammadans number 46,205; Hindus, 5452; and Sikhs, 122. Of the 136 towns and villages in the tahsil, 102 contain less than two hundred inhabitants; 20 from five hundred to a thousand; and 14 from one thousand to five thousand. There is no town of Sangarh, nor any place with a population exceeding five thousand inhabitants. The tahsil takes its name from a little mountain torrent, the Sangarh; and the head-quarters are at the village of Taunsa. Principal crops\u2014wheat, b\u00e1jra, jo\u00e1r, and cotton. Revenue of the tahsil, \u00a34977. The administrative staff consists of a t\u00e3hsild\u00e1r and an honorary magistrate, who preside over 2 civil and 2 criminal courts; strength of regular police, 28 men; village watch or rural police (chaukid\u00e1rs), 38.\n\n**S\u00e1ngarhi.**\u2014Town in Sakol\u00ed tahsil, Bhand\u00e1r\u00e1 District, Central Provinces; situated in lat. $20^\\circ 58'$ N., long. $80^\\circ$ E., 24 miles south-east of Bhand\u00e1r\u00e1 town, and 3 miles south of the Seoni Lake (vide Seoniband). Population (1881) 3172, namely, Hindus, 2637; Muhammadans, 178; Jains, 7; and non-Hindu aborigines, 350. Manufactures of cotton cloth, which is largely exported, and silk-spinning. S\u00e1ngarhi derives its name from the ruined Afgh\u00e1n fort which commands it. The town stands on a gravelly soil, but is unhealthy, owing to the brackishness of the water-supply from most of the wells. Flourishing Government school.\n\n**Sanghi.**\u2014Town in Rohtak tahsil, Rohtak District, Punjab; situated in lat. $29^\\circ 1'$ N., long. $76^\\circ 37'$ E., about 9 miles from Rohtak town, and\n1 mile from the right bank of the Rohtak branch of the Western Jumna Canal. Population (1881) 5194, namely, Hindus, 4621; Muhammadans, 545; Jains, 25; and 'others,' 3. Number of houses, 844. Rather an agricultural village than a town, with a school and post-office.\n\nS\u00e1ngli.\u2014Native State in the Political Agency of the Southern Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 Country, Bombay Presidency; consisting of six separate divisions\u2014a group of villages near the valley of the Kistna; a second group between the Kolh\u00e1pur territory on the west and J\u00e1mkh\u00e1ndi State; a third group in Shol\u00e1pur District, near the junction of the M\u00e1n and Bh\u00edma rivers; a fourth in Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r District; a fifth just north of the town of Belg\u00e1um; and the last to the south of the river Malprabha and to the north-east of Kitt\u00far in Belg\u00e1um. The State contains a total area of 896 square miles, of which about 91 square miles are under forest. Population (1872) 223,663; (1881) 196,832, namely, males 98,037, and females 98,795, occupying 31,183 houses, in 5 towns and 235 villages. Hindus number 172,257; Muhammadans, 13,082; and 'others,' 11,493.\n\nThe portion of the State of S\u00e1ngli watered by the Kistna is flat, and the soil particularly rich. The remaining divisions are plains surrounded by undulating lands, and occasionally intersected by ridges of hills. The prevailing soil is black. Irrigation is carried on from rivers, wells, and tanks. The climate is the same as that of the Deccan generally, the air being very dry, especially when east winds prevail. The most common diseases are cholera, small-pox, and fever. The chief products are millet, rice, wheat, gram, and cotton; and the manufactures coarse cotton cloth, and native articles of apparel.\n\nThe chief of S\u00e1ngli is a member of the Patwardhan family, whose founder Haribhat, a Konkan Br\u00e1hman, rose to military command under the first Peshw\u00e1, and received grants of land on condition of military service. In 1772, Miraj descended to Chint\u00e1man R\u00e1o, grandson of Govind R\u00e1o Hari, the original grantee. Chint\u00e1man R\u00e1o being a child of six years, the State was managed during his minority by his uncle, Gang\u00e1dhar R\u00e1o. When the minor came of age, he quarrelled with his uncle, who attempted to keep him out of his rights. Eventually the estate was divided between them, the uncle retaining Miraj, and Chint\u00e1man R\u00e1o taking S\u00e1ngli. The revenue of S\u00e1ngli was \u00a363,518, and of Miraj, \u00a347,980; the estates being respectively subject to a service of 1920 and 1219 horse. Chint\u00e1man R\u00e1o, the father of the present chief of S\u00e1ngli, became a feudatory of the British Government on the downfall of the Peshw\u00e1 in 1818-19. In 1846, the East India Company presented him with a sword in testimony of their respect for his high character, and in acknowledgment of his fidelity and attachment to the British Government. Chint\u00e1man R\u00e1o died in 1851. The\nchief of S\u00e1ngli does not now pay any contribution on account of military service, having ceded lands of the annual value of \u00a313,500 in lieu thereof. The family hold a title authorizing adoption.\n\nThe present chief is Dhundi R\u00e1o Chint\u00e1man, a Hindu of the Br\u00e1hman caste. He ranks as a \u2018first-class\u2019 Sard\u00e1r in the Southern Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 Country, and has power to try capital offences without the express permission of the Political Agent. This power, however, applies to his own subjects only. In consequence of misgovernment by the chief, an English officer was in 1873 appointed as Joint Administrator. The share of the chief in the administration consists in signing such papers as are placed before him. Every improvement has proceeded from the Joint Administrator. The chief enjoys an estimated gross revenue of \u00a398,135, and maintains a police force of 473 men; of these, 43 are mounted, 24 are employed in the State band, and 110 are armed. There were in 1883\u201384, 60 schools, of which 4 were girls\u2019 schools and 4 Anglo-veracular; number of pupils, 3611. Indigenous schools numbered 36. There are in the State 5 municipalities; the largest has an income of \u00a31238, and the smallest of \u00a3117. In the eight jails of the State, 732 persons were confined in 1883\u201384.\n\nS\u00e1ngli.\u2014Chief town of S\u00e1ngli State, Bombay Presidency; situated in lat. 16\u00b0 51\u2032 35\u2033 N., and long. 74\u00b0 36\u2032 20\u2033 E., on the river Kistna, a little north of the confluence of the W\u00e1rna, and north-east of Kolh\u00e1pur. Population (1872) 12,961; (1881) 13,272, namely, males 6755, and females 6517. Hindus numbered 10,786; Muhammadans, 1660; Jains, 820; and Christians, 6. The income of the municipality in 1883\u201384 was \u00a31238. The fort, in which is the chief\u2019s palace and most of the public offices, was built about 80 years ago. Dispensary and ten schools, including one for girls.\n\nSangod.\u2014Town in Kotah State, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. Population (1881) 5006, namely, Hindus, 4261; Muhammadans, 582; and \u2018others,\u2019 163.\n\nS\u00e1ngola.\u2014Sub-division of Shol\u00e1pur District, Bombay Presidency; situated in the south-west corner of the District. Lat. 17\u00b0 8\u2032 to 17\u00b0 40\u2032 N., and long. 74\u00b0 59\u2032 to 75\u00b0 32\u2032 E. Area, 649 square miles. Population (1872) 62,960; (1881) 62,849, namely, males 31,797, and females 31,052, occupying 8196 houses, in 1 town and 75 villages. Hindus number 60,540; Muhammadans, 2197; and \u2018others,\u2019 112. S\u00e1ngola is a level plain with a few treeless hillocks fringing its southern border. It is mostly bare of trees. Villages are three or four miles apart. The chief river is the M\u00e1n, which drains the Sub-division from west to north-east for about 35 miles. Most of the soil is stony and barren; and much of it fit only for grazing. In 1882\u201383, including alienated lands, the total number of holdings was 5259, with an average area of about 54 acres. In 1881\u201382, the area under actual cultivation was 215,894 acres, of which 8019 were twice cropped. Cereals and millets\noccupied 187,840 acres; pulses, 16,982; oil-seeds, 9801 acres; fibres, 5599 acres; and miscellaneous crops, 3691 acres. In 1883 the Sub-division contained 1 civil and 2 criminal courts; police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), 3; regular police, 37 men; village watch (chaukid\u00e1rs), 115. Land revenue, \u00a38454.\n\nS\u00e1ngola.\u2014Chief town of the S\u00e1ngola Sub-division of Shol\u00e1pur District, Bombay Presidency; situated 19 miles south-west of Pandharpur, in lat. 17\u00b0 26' 30\" N., and long. 75\u00b0 14' 15\" E. Population (1881) 4726, namely, Hindus, 4294; Muhammadans, 403; and Jains, 29. Besides the revenue and police officers of the Sub-division, S\u00e1ngola has a post-office, two schools, and a fort. The fort, which is now occupied by the Sub-divisional offices, is said to have been built by a Bij\u00e1pur king; and so prosperous was the town which grew up round it, that until it was plundered by Holkar's Path\u00e1ns in 1802, it was locally called the Golden S\u00e1ngola (Sony\u00e1che S\u00e1ngola). The town has never recovered the sack of 1802. Municipality, established in 1855, had an income in 1883-84 of \u00a3146; incidence of taxation per head of population, 7d.\n\nSangr\u00e1mpur.\u2014Town in Champ\u00e1ran District, Bengal; situated in lat. 26\u00b0 28' 38\" N., and long. 84\u00b0 44' E., on the river Gandak. Population (1872) 6181. Not separately returned in the Census Report of 1881.\n\nSangri.\u2014One of the Simla Hill States, Punjab. Area, 16 square miles. Sangri is situated south of the river Sutlej (Satlaj), and formerly belonged to the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of K\u00falu, whose main possessions lay north of that river. Population (1881) 2593, all Hindus, residing in 435 houses; number of families, 550. When the G\u00farkhas were expelled by the British in 1815, the estate was restored to the R\u00e1ja of K\u00falu. His territories north of the Sutlej were, however, conquered by the Sikhs, and the R\u00e1ja took refuge in Sangri, where he died childless in 1841. On the country falling under British power after the first Sikh war, his nephew was recognised, in 1847, as chief of Sangri. The present (1884) Tika of Sangri is Hira Singh, a Rajput. Estimated gross revenue, \u00a3100. The chief products are opium and grain.\n\nSangu.\u2014Sub-division of the Chittagong Hill Tracts, Bengal, formed in March 1867. It comprises the tract of country between the rivers Sangu and M\u00e1t\u00e1muri, along the north-eastern frontier of Bengal. Owing to the manner in which the Census of 1881 was taken in this backward District, no separate details of population, etc. are available. In 1883 the Sub-division contained 1 civil and 1 criminal court, with a regular police force of 32 men, and a semi-military frontier police numbering 135.\n\nSangu.\u2014River of Chittagong, Bengal; rises in the range of hills dividing Arakan from the Chittagong Hill Tracts, near the hill of Kud\u00e1ng. After a circuitous course of about 125 miles, generally\nnortherly, over a rocky bed, it reaches Band\u00e1rban, from which town it takes a tortuous westerly direction through Chittagong District, and finally empties itself into the Bay of Bengal, in lat. $22^\\circ 6' \\text{N}$., and long. $91^\\circ 53' \\text{E}$., about 10 miles south of the Karnaphul\u00ed. The Sangu is tidal as far as Band\u00e1rban; its bed here is sandy. Though shallow in ordinary times, during the rains this river becomes deep, dangerous, and rapid. In its upper reaches, the Sangu is called by the hillmen the Rigray Khyauing; midway, before entering the plains, it is known as the Sab\u00e1k Khyauing. It is navigable by large cargo boats for a distance of 30 miles throughout the year. The principal tributary is the Dolu.\n\nSanivarsante.\u2014Kasba or administrative head-quarters of Yelusa-virashime taluk, in the territory of Coorg. Lies on the Merk\u00e1ra-Kodlipet road. Distance from Merk\u00e1ra, 38 miles. Population (1881) 390. The name of the village is derived from a weekly fair held on Saturday. Manufacture of coarse cloth.\n\nSanj\u00e1n.\u2014Small village in Th\u00e1na (Tanna) District, Bombay Presidency, and a station on the Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway. Believed to have been formerly a large town, and the place where the P\u00e1rs\u00eds first landed in India. Known to the Portuguese, and long after their time, as \u2018St. John.\u2019\n\nSanjeli.\u2014Petty State of Rew\u00e1 K\u00e1ntha, Bombay Presidency. Area, $33\\frac{1}{2}$ square miles; contains 12 villages. Population (1881) 3751. Estimated revenue, \u00a3700. No tribute is paid. The chief is named Th\u00e1kur Part\u00e1b Sinhji. The land is fertile, but the people are Bh\u00edls and poor husbandmen.\n\nSankaridr\u00fag (Sanka-giri Durgam).\u2014Village in Trichengod taluk, Salem District, Madras. Lat. $11^\\circ 28' 52'' \\text{N}$., long. $77^\\circ 55' 40'' \\text{E}$. Population (1881) 1302, dwelling in 280 houses. Sub-magistrate\u2019s court, railway station, Roman Catholic chapel, and telegraph office.\n\nThe village is situated at the foot of the Durgam or Dr\u00fag, a square mass of gneiss rising 1000 feet above the plain, and 2345 feet above sea-level, completely terraced with fortifications, while half-way up, like a pearl set in emeralds, a white mosque nestles amongst the rich foliage which still covers part of the hill. On the summit is a small plateau, with a good supply of water stored in the rock. Viewed from below, the hill is a source of interest to the geologist, from the very fine specimens of granite veins piercing the gneiss, which have been exposed in the course of ages.\n\nThe Dr\u00fag was a place of great strength, and was not attempted by Colonel Wood in 1768, when he captured all the surrounding forts. The fortifications on the summit show traces of European engineering.\n\nSankarkati.\u2014Village in Kh\u00falna District, Bengal. Noted for its\nnumerously attended fair held during the Durg\u00e1-p\u00faj\u00e1, Dol, and Rath J\u00e1tr\u00e1 festivals. Bi-weekly market.\n\n**Sankarnain\u00e1rkoil.**\u2014T\u00e1luk or Sub-division of Tinneveli District, Madras Presidency. Area, 712 square miles. Population (1881) 181,064, namely, males 89,566, and females 91,498, occupying 37,817 houses, in 3 towns and 110 villages. Hindus number 172,633; Muhammadans, 2666; Christians, 5761; and \u2018others,\u2019 4. The t\u00e1luk lies at the foot of the gh\u00e1ts, and contains both red and black soils. The red-soil country is broken into valleys and ridges by numerous small torrents and streams descending from the mountains. Its principal wealth lies in its irrigated lands. Rice, plantain-gardens, and betel-vines are the products grown under irrigation. One-fourth of the whole area is black cotton soil, being a portion of the great cotton plain which occupies the north and north-east portion of Tinneveli District. The greater portion of the cotton soil of the t\u00e1luk is poor. In 1883 the t\u00e1luk contained 2 criminal courts; police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), 8; regular police, 52 men. Land revenue, \u00a326,464.\n\n**Sankarnain\u00e1rkoil.**\u2014Town in Tinneveli District, Madras Presidency; situated in lat. 9\u00b0 10' 10\" N., and long. 77\u00b0 34' 35\" E., 10 miles east of the road from Madura to Travancore. Population (1881) 8212, dwelling in 1542 houses. Hindus number 7679; Muhammadans, 455; and Christians, 78. A large, well-built town, with fine temples and tanks; and the head-quarters of Sankarnain\u00e1rkoil t\u00e1luk. Post-office.\n\n**Sankarpur.**\u2014Town in Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 District, Central Provinces; situated in lat. 20\u00b0 38' N., and long 79\u00b0 34' E., 16 miles north-north-east of Chim\u00e1r. Population (1881) 1758. Government school. Under the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, a cannon foundry was worked in Sankarpur, and some half-finished guns yet remain.\n\n**Sankeswar** (more correctly Shankheswar or \u2018the Shankh god\u2019).\u2014Town in Belg\u00e1um District, Bombay Presidency; situated in lat. 16\u00b0 15' N., and long. 74\u00b0 31' 30\" E., 27 miles north by west of Belg\u00e1um town. Population (1881) 8109. Sankeswar has a large traffic carried on by about 50 traders, who export cotton and import dry cocoa-nuts, dates, spices, and curry stuff. The ordinary industry is the weaving of waist-cloths, women\u2019s robes, and blankets. Post-office, three schools, two of them private, an old temple, and a monastery.\n\n**Sankh.**\u2014River of Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur, Bengal; rises in the west of Loh\u00e1rdag\u00e1 District, and after a tortuous course of 120 miles, first south-westerly and then south-easterly, joins the South Koel in Gangpur State. The united stream, under the name of the Br\u00e1hmani, enters the sea in the north of Orissa. The confluence of the South Koel and the Sankh is the most picturesque spot in Gangpur. Local tradition\nasserts it to be the scene of the amour of the Sage Par\u00e1surama with the fisherman's daughter Matsya Gandh\u00e1, the offspring of which was Vy\u00e1sa, the reputed compiler of the Veda and the Mah\u00e1bhdrata.\n\n**Sankh\u00e1.** \u2014 Village in Gh\u00e1z\u00edpur tahsil, Gh\u00e1z\u00edpur District, North-Western Provinces; situated in lat. 25\u00b0 47' N., long. 80\u00b0 44' 34\" E., 4 miles from Gh\u00e1z\u00edpur town. Population (1881) 2262, chiefly R\u00e1jputs. Bi-weekly market. Annual fair in September, lasting two days.\n\n**Sankhatra.** \u2014 Town and municipality in Zaffarw\u00e1l tahsil, Si\u00e1lkot (Sealkote) District, Punjab; situated in lat. 32\u00b0 13' N., long. 74\u00b0 58' E.; about 30 miles from Si\u00e1lkot town. Population (1881) 2381, namely, Muhammadans, 1242; Hindus, 1030; Jains, 82; and Sikhs, 27. Number of houses, 305. Municipal income (1883-84), \u00a3125, or an average of 1s. 1d. per head. Trade in sugar, the produce of neighbouring villages. School and post-office.\n\n**Sankheda.** \u2014 Town in Baroda State, Bombay Presidency. \u2014 See SAKHERA.\n\n**Sankheda Mew\u00e1s.** \u2014 Group of native estates in Rew\u00e1 K\u00e1ntha, Bombay Presidency. \u2014 See SINDKHER MEW\u00c1S.\n\n**S\u00e1nkhund.** \u2014 Spring in Bh\u00e1galpur District, Bengal; so called from the monster sankh or shell Panchajanya, mentioned in the Mah\u00e1bhdrata, the sound of which filled the breasts of the enemy with dismay. This shell is said to have rested beneath the waters of the spring, and its impression on the bank\u2014three feet in length by a foot and a half wide\u2014is still shown.\n\n**Sankisa.** \u2014 Village and ruins in Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d District, North-Western Provinces; identified by General Cunningham with the great city of the same name, which formed the capital of a considerable kingdom in the 5th century A.D. Situated on the K\u00e1l\u00ed-nadi river, 23 miles west of Fatehgarh town. Visited by Fa-Hian about 415 A.D., and by Hiuen Tsiang in 636 A.D., when it was a celebrated place of Buddhist pilgrimage, as being the reputed spot where Buddha, accompanied by Indra and Brahma, descended again upon earth by three staircases of gold, silver, and crystal or precious stones, after a residence of three months in the Triyastrinshas' heaven, spent in preaching the law to his mother, M\u00e1ya. The three staircases are believed to have sunk underground immediately after the descent, leaving only seven steps visible. King Asoka afterwards erected a pillar to commemorate the event, but no remains of it can now with certainty be discovered. Hiuen Tsiang mentions that the site and the memorial pillar were, in his time, enclosed within the walls of a great monastery.\n\nThe existing village is perched upon a mound of ruins, known as the kil\u00fa or fort, 41 feet in height, with a superficial extent of 1500 feet by 1000. A quarter of a mile southward is another mound, composed of solid brickwork, and surmounted by a temple to Bis\u00e1ri Devi. North\nof the temple mound, at a distance of 400 feet, lies the capital of an ancient pillar, bearing an erect figure of an elephant, wanting the trunk and tail. The capital is described by General Cunningham as being of the well-known bell-shape, reeded perpendicularly with a honeysuckle abacus, as in the pillar at Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d; and it evidently belongs to the same period, the 3rd century B.C. Hence General Cunningham considers it identical with Asoka\u2019s monument, mentioned by the Chinese Pilgrims, although the latter was said to be crowned by the figure of a lion\u2014a discrepancy which the learned archaeologist explains away by supposing that the trunk was already broken off in the 5th century A.D., and that the animal could no longer be distinguished at a height of 50 feet above the ground.\n\nSouth of the temple of Bis\u00e1ri Devi, again, at a distance of 200 feet, occurs a third small mound of ruins, apparently the remains of a stupa; while 600 feet due east is a fourth mound, 600 feet by 500, known as Nivi-ka-kot, which seems to contain the remains of some large enclosed building like a Buddhist monastery. The fort and the various mounds which surround the temple form a mass of ruins 3000 feet in length by 2000 in breadth, or nearly 2 miles in circuit; but this space appears only to enclose the citadel and the religious edifices which gathered round the three holy staircases by which Buddha descended upon the earth. The city itself, which surrounded the central holy enclosure, was girt by an earthen rampart upwards of 3\u00bd miles in circumference, and still distinctly traceable in the shape of an irregular dodecagon. Three openings which occur in the rampart are traditionally pointed out as the gates of the ancient city. South-east of the Sankisa ruins lies the tank of the N\u00e1ga, known as Karewar, and identified with a \u2018dragon tank\u2019 described by Fa-Hian. The city was probably destroyed during the wars between Prithwi R\u00e1j of Delhi and Jai Chand of Kanauj. Other interesting ruins occur in the neighbouring village of Sarai-Aghat, \u00be mile distant north-west.\n\n**Sankos** (or Suvarnakos; so called from its golden sands).\u2014River of North-Eastern Bengal, flowing through the low tract of country between the Him\u00e1layas and the Brahmaputra, where no river preserves its identity amid the frequent fluvial changes that take place year by year. It can only be affirmed that the name is given, in different parts of its course, to a river that flows southward from the Bh\u00fat\u00e1n Hills, and ultimately joins the Brahmaputra, in lat. 25\u00b0 52' N., and long. 89\u00b0 52' E. The main channel of this river forms the boundary between the Eastern and Western Dv\u00e1rs, thus separating Bengal from Assam. Its chief tributaries are the K\u00e1lj\u00e1n\u00ed and R\u00e1idhak on the right bank, and the Gad\u00e1dh\u00e1r on the left. The name of the Gad\u00e1dh\u00e1r is commonly applied to the united stream.\n\n**S\u00e1nkshi** (Sakse).\u2014Customs division in Kol\u00e1ba District, Bombay\nPresidency. Under S\u00e1nkshi are two ports\u2014Antora, the port of Pen on the Pen creek, and N\u00e1gothna at the head of the Rewas creek or Amba river. Average annual value of sea-borne trade for the five years ending 1883-84\u2014imports, \u00a342,690; exports, \u00a387,172; total, \u00a3129,862. In 1883-84 the trade amounted to\u2014imports, \u00a342,041; exports, \u00a387,498; total, \u00a3129,539.\n\nS\u00e1nkshi (also known as Badr-ud-din or Dargahcha Kila, from a tomb or dargah of the saint Badr-ud-din at its foot).\u2014Fort in the Pen Sub-division of Kol\u00e1ba District, Bombay Presidency; situated on a hill about five miles north-east of Pen town. The scene of repeated struggles between the Gujar\u00e1t and Ahmadnagar princes and the Portuguese, passing into the possession of either power more than once. In 1827, S\u00e1nkshi was the scene of an encounter between a detachment of the 4th Rifles and a band of fanatical d\u00e1k\u00faits, in which three European soldiers were killed. The place was the head-quarters of a Sub-division until 1866, when they were removed to Pen.\n\nSann.\u2014Town in the M\u00e1njhund t\u00e1luk of Sehw\u00e1n Sub-division, Kar\u00e1chi (Kurrachee) District, Sind, Bombay Presidency; situated in lat. 26\u00b0 N., and long. 68\u00b0 8' E., close to the western bank of the Indus, at the mouth of a torrent that issues from the Laki Hills; on the main road from Kotri to Sehw\u00e1n, being 11 miles north of M\u00e1njhund, and 11 south of Amri. Sann station, on the Sind, Punjab, and Delhi Railway, is a little more than two miles from the town. To the south-west of Sann is the ruined fort of R\u00e1n\u00ed-ka-kot, said to have been constructed by two of the Talpur Mirs early in the present century, at a cost of 12 l\u00edkhs of rupees (say \u00a3120,000). Originally the river flowed near the walls, but when its course changed, the fort was abandoned. Sann has no trade or manufactures of any consequence; but as it is situated on the trunk road, k\u00e1f\u00edlas (caravans), with various commodities from Kandah\u00e1r and Khel\u00e1t, pass through it. Sann is the head-quarters of a tappad\u00e1r; it also contains a post-office, school, dharms\u00e1la, and a small police post. Population (1872) 1798, namely, 1362 Muhammadans and 436 Hindus; not separately returned in the Census Report of 1881.\n\nSanosra.\u2014Petty State in the Jh\u00e1l\u00e1war division of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay Presidency; consisting of 3 villages, with 1 shareholder or tribute-payer. Area, 13 square miles. Population (1881) 1140. Estimated revenue, \u00a3403, of which \u00a318, 12s. is paid as tribute to the British Government, and \u00a35, os. 2d. to the Naw\u00e1b of Jun\u00e1garh.\n\nSansar Dh\u00e1ra.\u2014Grotto and place of pilgrimage in Dehra D\u00fan District, North-Western Provinces. Lat. 30\u00b0 21' N., long. 78\u00b0 6' E. A waterfall gushes from a cleft in the rock, with a grotto behind it, in which stalactites are formed. The Hindus consider it sacred to Mah\u00e1deva, and visit it in considerable numbers. Distant from Mussoree (Mas\u00fari) about 12 miles.\nSant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s, The.\u2014District in the Lieutenant-Governorship of Bengal, lying between 23\u00b0 48' and 25\u00b0 19' N. lat., and between 86\u00b0 30' and 87\u00b0 58' E. long. Area, 5456 square miles. Population, according to the Census of 1881, 1,568,093 souls. The Sant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s form the southern portion of the Bh\u00e1galpur Division. They are bounded on the north by the Districts of Bh\u00e1galpur and Purniah; on the east by Maldah, Murshid\u00e1b\u00e1d, and B\u00edrbh\u00fam; on the south by Bardw\u00e1n and M\u00e1nbh\u00fam; and on the west by Haz\u00e1rib\u00e1gh, Monghyr, and Bh\u00e1galpur. The administrative head-quarters are at Dumka.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014Three distinct types of country are represented in the Sant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s. In the east of the District, a belt of hills stretches with a semicircular curve for about a hundred miles from the Ganges to the N\u00fanbil river. West of this is a rolling tract of long ridges with intervening depressions, covering an area of about 2500 square miles. The third type is exemplified by a narrow, almost continuous, strip of alluvial land about 170 miles in length, lying for the most part along the loop-line of the East Indian Railway. The total area of this alluvial tract is about 650 square miles. The undulating upland tract, which includes the Sub-divisions of Deogarh and Jamt\u00e1ra and the southern portion of Godd\u00e1, is in many parts overgrown with jungle; and the gneiss, which forms the geological basis of the District generally, is here overlaid by the carboniferous shales and sandstones that form the Deogarh coal-field.\n\nThe Rajmahal Hills, which abruptly rise from the valley of the Ganges, were, until very recently, regarded as a continuation of the Vindhyan range of Central India. It has been found, however, that not only are they physically quite detached from the Vindhyan hill system, but geologically there is nothing in common between the two. The R\u00e1jmah\u00e1l Hills occupy an area of about 2000 square miles, of which 1366 square miles are in the Government estate of the D\u00e1man-i-koh; they nowhere rise higher than 2000 feet above the sea, their average elevation being considerably less. Among the highest ridges are Mori and Sendgarsa, each about 2000 feet above the sea. The principal ranges of the R\u00e1jmah\u00e1l Hills outside the D\u00e1man-i-koh are the N\u00fani, Sankara, R\u00e1mgarh, Kulanga, Sarbor, Sundardihi, Lakshmanp\u00far, and Sabchala. Singanm\u00e1t, a peak in the Sankara range, is well known as a landmark for all the country round. Most of these hills are covered almost to their summits with dense jungle, and are difficult of access. There are, however, numerous passes through the successive ranges, over which good roads might without difficulty be made.\n\nThe Ganges forms the northern and a large part of the eastern boundary of the Sant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s, and all the rivers of the District eventually flow either into it or into the Bh\u00e1girath\u00ed. The chief of these rivers are the Gum\u00e1n\u00ed, the Moral, the B\u00e1nsloi, the Br\u00e1hman\u00ed, the Mor or\nMor\u00e1khi with its tributary the Naubil, the Ajai, and the Bar\u00e1khar. None of them is navigable throughout the year.\n\nForests.\u2014Although the face of the country is to a large extent covered with jungle, there are no forests in the Sant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s which contain timber of much commercial value. Government obtains a small revenue by leasing out the right to cut timber for firewood in the D\u00e1man-i-koh; and trifling amounts are realized by the landholders in the form of royalties on every axe employed in cutting wood. The characteristic tree of the jungles of the District is the s\u00e1l, large numbers of which are floated down the Mor during the rains, while still more are exported during the dry season on sagars or block-wheeled carts.\n\nJungle Products.\u2014The principal jungle products of the Sant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s are the following:\u2014Lac, found on the pal\u00eds, ber, and p\u00edpal trees, and exported in small quantities from the Mahar\u00e1jpur station, but not locally manufactured. Tasar silk cocoons are gathered in large quantities by the Sant\u00e1ls and Pah\u00e1ri\u00e1s. Dhun\u00e1 or resin is obtained by girdling the s\u00e1l tree. Beeswax, catechu, honey, s\u00e1bui grass, k\u00f6nj\u00fa, and jomb\u00e1r, two creepers used for making rope, and also a variety of edible products, are collected in the jungles. The use of jungle products as a means of subsistence is confined, for the most part, to Pah\u00e1ri\u00e1s, Sant\u00e1ls, and Bhuiy\u00e1s. Patches of grazing ground are to be found in all the hills and jungles, but cattle are not brought from other Districts for grazing.\n\nMinerals.\u2014Coal and iron are found in almost all parts of the Sant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s. The various attempts that have been made to work coal-mines, and to quarry building-stone in the District, are noticed in a subsequent paragraph. In 1850, some copper and silver ores were dug up by Captain Sherwill in the Sub-District of Deoghar. Fourteen pounds of silver ore were treated in Calcutta by Mr. H. Piddington, Curator of the Museum of Economic Geology, and yielded 154 grains of pure silver, showing it to be \u2018far above an average ore.\u2019 The copper ore was found to be very poor. Picturesque waterfalls are formed near the villages of Kuskir\u00e1, Sinhpur, and Mahar\u00e1jpur, and there are several mineral springs in the District.\n\nFerae Naturae.\u2014Tigers, leopards, bears, hy\u00e6nas, deer, and wild hog, with a variety of small game, are common almost everywhere. Elephants and rhinoceros used to be seen, but have now almost died out. Wild ducks, pigeons, geese, snipe, partridges, and quail abound in the marshes of the alluvial part of the District.\n\nHistory.\u2014The administrative history of the Sant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s is the history of the gradual withdrawal of the territory now comprised in the District from the operation of the general Regulations; that withdrawal being throughout dictated by a regard for the peculiar national\ncharacter of the two races of Pah\u00e1ri\u00e1s and Sant\u00e1ls. The policy was in the first instance set on foot by Mr. Augustus Cleveland, Collector of Bh\u00e1galpur, in the rules which he proposed for the management of the Pah\u00e1ri\u00e1s between 1780 and 1784. These rules, which are referred to in the article on BHAGALPUR DISTRICT, were incorporated in Regulation I. of 1796, so that Cleveland has a fair claim to be considered the author of the Non-Regulation system. It followed, however, from confirming the Pah\u00e1ri\u00e1s in possession of the hills, that disputes arose between them and the Hindu zamind\u00e1rs of the plains as to the right of grazing cattle and cutting timber along the lower slopes. That the hills had really or nominally belonged to the zamind\u00e1rs, there can be no doubt; but the troubles following the British accession, and shortly afterwards the great famine of 1769\u201370, had weakened or destroyed their control. Cleveland practically assumed possession of the hills on behalf of Government; they were excluded from the Permanent Settlement in 1793; and finally in 1823, the Government by Resolution declared its proprietary right in the hills, and ordered that the tract covered by this declaration should be demarcated. Accordingly, in 1825, two Government officials were deputed to demarcate with solid masonry pillars the present area of the D\u00e1man-i-koh or \u2018skirts of the hills,\u2019 a work which was not completed till 1833. The great central valley still remained the property of the zamind\u00e1r of pargan\u00e1 Bh\u00e1galpur till 1839, when it too was resumed. The permission to Sant\u00e1ls to settle in the valleys and on the lower slopes of the D\u00e1man-i-koh stimulated Sant\u00e1l immigration to an enormous extent; and it might be supposed that the natural consequence of that immigration would have been the admission of the Sant\u00e1ls to the exceptional privileges which the Pah\u00e1ri\u00e1s already enjoyed. But this measure, although more than once proposed, was not approved by Government; and the next phase in the history of the District is the Sant\u00e1l rebellion of 1855\u201356.\n\nThe story of that rebellion, and the causes which led to it, would occupy more space than can here be given; but the reader will find an exhaustive account of it in Hunter\u2019s Annals of Rural Bengal, and a shorter sketch under article INDIA (ante, Vol. vi.). The Sant\u00e1ls, starting with the desire to revenge themselves on the Hindu money-lenders who had taken advantage of their simplicity and improvidence, found themselves arrayed in arms against the British Government. The insurrection was not repressed without bloodshed, but it led to the establishment of a form of administration congenial to the Sant\u00e1l immigrants; and a land settlement has recently been carried out on conditions favourable to the occupants of the soil.\n\nPopulation.\u2014No estimate of the population of the entire District exists previous to the Census of 1872. That enumeration disclosed a total of 1,259,287 persons; while the last Census in 1881 returned\na total of 1,586,093, or an apparent increase of 308,806, or 24\u00b752 per cent., in 9 years. This increase, however, is to a very large extent only nominal, and is mainly attributable to the much greater accuracy of the enumeration in 1881. The results of the Census of 1881 may be summarized as follows:\u2014Area of District, 5456 square miles; towns 4, and villages 11,250; number of houses, 252,486, namely, 246,746 occupied, and 5740 unoccupied. Total population, 1,568,093, namely, males 785,330, and females 782,763. Average density of population, 287\u00b74 persons per square mile; towns and villages per square mile, 2\u00b706; persons per town or village, 139; houses per square mile, 46\u00b728; persons per occupied house, 6\u00b736. Classified according to sex and age, there were\u2014under 15 years of age, boys 368,939, and girls 358,530; total children, 727,469, or 46\u00b74 per cent. of the population; 15 years and upwards, men 416,391, and women 424,233; total adults, 840,624, or 53\u00b76 per cent. The abnormally large proportion of children is due to the fact that the aboriginal Sant\u00e1ls are one of the most prolific races in Bengal.\n\nReligion.\u2014Classified according to religion, the Census of 1881 returned the population as follows:\u2014Hindus, 847,590, or 53\u00b74 per cent.; Muhammadans, 108,899, or 6\u00b78 per cent.; Christians, 3057; Buddhists, 132; Sikhs, 54; Jains, 2; Jews, 6; and tribes professing aboriginal religions, 608,353, or 38\u00b74 per cent., of whom 559,602 were Sant\u00e1ls and 11,995 Kols, the remainder being made up of other tribes.\n\nAmong the higher Hindu castes, Br\u00e1hmans number 36,075; R\u00e1jputs, 28,124; B\u00e1bhans or cultivating Br\u00e1hmans, 5406; K\u00e1yasths, 7820; and Baniy\u00e1s, 28,124. The lower or S\u00fadra castes of Hindus include the following:\u2014Gh\u00e1tw\u00e1l, not properly a caste, although returned as such in the Census Report, but a branch of the aboriginal race of Bhuiy\u00e1s. They, however, take the name of Gh\u00e1tw\u00e1l as a caste designation to denote their occupation as guardians of the hill passes. They keep fowls and pigs; but the well-to-do members of the tribe claim to be Kshattriyas. The number of Gh\u00e1tw\u00e1ls returned as such in the Census Report of 1881 was 38,032. Go\u00e1l\u00e1, the most numerous caste in the District, 88,544; Dom, 35,723; Cham\u00e1r, 33,546; Loh\u00e1r, 26,433; Teli, 24,986; N\u00e1pit, 21,714; Kumbh\u00e1r, 21,484; M\u00e1l, 20,533; Sunr\u00ed, 19,059; Musah\u00e1r, 18,588; Baur\u00ed, 18,515; Kah\u00e1rs, 16,608; Koer\u00ed, 13,589; Madak, 13,462; Kurn\u00ed, 13,177; Dhanuk, 12,162; Kalu, 10,929; Dos\u00e1dh, 10,801; Kaibartt\u00e1, 10,749; Hari, 8894; T\u00e1nt\u00ed, 8864; Dh\u00f3b\u00ed, 8052; R\u00e1jwar, 6215; Barh\u00e1i, 5841; B\u00e1gdi, 5104; Kalw\u00e1r, 4673; Son\u00e1r, 4156; M\u00e1l\u00ed, 3807; Tambuli, 3186; Mallah, 2799; Kandu, 2772; Ch\u00e1s\u00e1, 2626; Sadgop, 2471; P\u00e1s\u00ed, 2420; Tatw\u00e1, 2401; Tior, 2381; and Barui, 2218. Caste-rejecting Hindus were returned at 8193, of whom 6346 were Vaishnavs.\nThe Muhammadans in 1881 numbered 108,899, or 6\u00b733 per cent. of the population, classified according to sect into\u2014Sunnis, 96,736; Shi\u00e1s, 2607; and unspecified, 9556. The Musalm\u00e1n population of Deogarh Sub-division is said to have been introduced early in the 18th century by the Muhammadan R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Nagar in B\u00edrbh\u00fam District, of whose zamind\u00e1r\u00ed or principality it formed a part. In Dumk\u00e1 Sub-division, the Muhammadans mostly belong to the low weaving castes, whose adherence to the religion of Isl\u00e1m is little more than nominal. A few Wah\u00e1b\u00ed revivalists are found in R\u00e1jmah\u00e1l Sub-division, where the landholders are Muhammadans, and memories of Musalm\u00e1n domination still survive. Taking the Sant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s as a whole, the Muhammadans do not hold a high social position, and are a far less wealthy and less influential body than the Hindus.\n\nOf the aboriginal population, 608,353 are returned as still professing their primitive faiths. Of these, 559,602 are returned as Sant\u00e1ls, 11,995 as Kols, and 36,756 as belonging to other aboriginal tribes. Besides these, the Census returns show 108,355 aborigines among Hindus, consisting of\u2014Bhuiy\u00e1s, 61,640; Sant\u00e1ls, 9148; Bhumijs, 3880; Kh\u00e1r-w\u00e1rs, 2862; Kols, 2094; Gonds, 571; and other tribes, 28,160. The Pah\u00e1ri\u00e1s are not returned separately in the Census of 1881, and are probably included with the general body of Sant\u00e1ls. Total Hindu and non-Hindu aboriginal population, 716,708. This, however, does not include aborigines converted to the faith of Isl\u00e1m or to Christianity; and the list of Hindu castes includes several undoubted aboriginal and semi-aboriginal tribes; e.g. the Gh\u00e1tw\u00e1ls, Baur\u00eds, Binds, etc. An account of the Sant\u00e1ls forms the subject of the following article in this volume.\n\nThe Christian population of the Sant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s amounted at the time of the Census of 1881 to 3057 souls, namely, Europeans, Americans, and Africans, 182; Eurasians, 108; natives of India, 2718; and \u2018others,\u2019 49. Nearly all the converts belong to the aboriginal races who are engaged in agriculture; and Christianity has produced little effect upon the general Hindu population, or on the more civilised inhabitants of the towns. The Church Missionary Society has stations in the District at Hir\u00e1npur, T\u00e1ljhari, Godda, Bhagai\u00e1, and Bah\u00e1wa; as also has the Sant\u00e1l Home Mission, with its head-quarters at Dumk\u00e1. A private mission carries on work in Jamt\u00e1r\u00e1. Within the past few years, attempts have been made, through the Rev. L. O. Skrefsrud, the head of the Sant\u00e1l Home Mission, to improve the condition of the converts by establishing Christian colonies of Sant\u00e1l agriculturists in Assam, where unlimited spare land is available. Between 1880 and 1885, nine such villages, with a total population of between 600 and 700 men, women, and children, had been settled in the Gum\u00e1 dw\u00e1r tract of Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1 District. The Rev. H. P. Boerrensen, in charge of\nthe Settlement, reported in September 1885, that the colony had successfully passed the initial stage of experiment; that a considerable area of land had been reclaimed from jungle and brought under cultivation; that, free from the pressure of Bengali landlords and usurers, and with a splendid soil yielding rich crops, the colonists, with three or four individual exceptions, had all become well-to-do, and many of them rich according to Santal ideas. The whole of the debt due to Government, incurred in the shape of advances made to start the undertaking, has been paid off by the settlers.\n\nEthnical Division of the People.\u2014The distribution of the races in the Santal Parganas is traceable rather to the controlling action of Government, than to the geographical position or physical conformation of the District. The colony of Paharias which occupies the Rajmahal hills is like an advanced outpost, cut off from the main body of the aboriginal races farther west by the great Aryan line of communication between Bengal and Behar. Although the crests of the ranges are barren enough to deter any other race from contesting their possession with the Paharias, yet there is little doubt that but for the ring fence erected by Government between 1825 and 1833, all the lands of the lower levels would have been occupied by Bengali or Hindustani immigrants. Since the enclosure of the Daman-i-koh, however, a continual stream of Santal immigrants has been pouring into the District from Hazaribagh and Manbhum, and occupying the valleys and lower slopes of the hills which the Paharias do not cultivate. The remaining inhabitants of the District are either Bengali immigrants from the southeast, or Hindustanis from the north-west; but the Census returns afford no means of estimating the relative strength of the two nationalities in the Santal Parganas. With reference to the three tracts of hilly, undulating, and alluvial country into which the District is divided, it may be laid down with approximate correctness that the hilly country is inhabited mainly by Santals, Paharias, and other aboriginal tribes; the undulating region by semi-aboriginal races, with a smaller proportion of aborigines and a fair sprinkling of Aryan settlers; and the alluvial strip of country almost entirely by Aryans.\n\nTown and Rural Population.\u2014The population is almost entirely rural, and the only places with upwards of five thousand inhabitants are Deogarh, population (1881) 8005; and Sahibganj, the great commercial mart on the Ganges, population 6512. The only other places with any pretensions to be called towns are Dumka, the administrative head-quarters of the District, 2075; and Rajmahal, 3839. Of the 11,250 villages, as many as 8998 contain less than two hundred inhabitants; 1881 between two hundred and five hundred; 335 between five hundred and a thousand; 33 between one thousand and two thousand; and 3 between two thousand and three thousand inhabitants.\nAs regards occupation, the Census Report returns the male population under the following six classes:\u2014(1) Professional class, including civil and military, 7134; (2) domestic class, 14,625; (3) commercial class, including traders and carriers, 15,323; (4) agricultural and pastoral class, including gardeners, 325,718; (5) manufacturing and industrial class, including all artisans, 27,593; and (6) indefinite and unspecified class, comprising general labourers and male children, 394,937.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Rice forms the staple food-grain of the District. J\u00e1r\u00e1n or \u00e1man rice, the winter crop of the year, is of two kinds\u2014b\u00e1o, which is sown broadcast; and rop\u00e1 dh\u00e1m, which is transplanted; of these, forty varieties are named. In the alluvial strip of country which runs along the eastern boundary of the District, rice is largely cultivated; and the lower slopes of the ridges in the undulating tract, as well as the swampy ground between those ridges, are also sown with rice. Level terraces are cut out of the hillsides, which thus present the appearance of a series of steps varying from one to five feet in height. These rice terraces are flooded as soon as possible after the rains set in, small banks being left round the edge of each plot to hold the water. Among the other crops of the District are millets, wheat, barley, maize, various pulses and oil-seeds, jute, flax, sugar-cane (of which four varieties are distinguished), cotton, and indigo. There are two seasons for sowing indigo: the spring sowings are put into the ground in March, and reaped in June; and the autumn or October sowings are also cut in the following June.\n\nNo accurate statistics are available showing the area under different crops; and it is evident from what has been said regarding the physical aspects of the District, and the mode of rice cultivation in the undulating tract, that there would be considerable difficulty in estimating the aggregate area under rice. The food crops grown in the District are, (1) rice, (2) janir\u00e1 or maize, and (3) other grains, such as millet and pulses. Of this food supply locally produced, rice forms eleven-sixteenths; janir\u00e1 three-sixteenths. There are large stretches of spare land all over the District, and cultivation is being gradually extended to them.\n\nNo scientific system of rotation has as yet been developed, but a sort of rotation is followed on high lands only recently brought under cultivation, which are sown for three successive years with oil-seeds or pulses. On homestead lands around the cultivator's house, which can be thoroughly manured, it is a common practice to alternate Indian corn with mustard. Manure, consisting of cow-dung, wood-ashes, and mud from the bottom of tanks, is commonly used for sugar-cane, and for such high land crops as Indian corn, tobacco, and mustard, when they are in the neighbourhood of the house, and can conveniently be\nattended to. Rice is not manured at all. Irrigation is effected for the most part by bandhs or small embankments thrown across the upper and narrower ends of the trough-like hollows which make up the surface of the country. Each embankment thus holds up the natural drainage and forms a small reservoir at a high level. Land below the bandh growing a rice crop can be irrigated by leading the water round the edges of the embankment, or by cutting the embankment itself; while the wheat, barley, sugar-cane, and poppy crops of the adjacent high lands can be watered by a lift. Wells are not used for irrigation.\n\nThere is no tendency towards the formation of a distinct landless labouring class. Such a class formerly existed in the kami\u00e1s or bonds-men, the nature of whose servitude is described in the article on Haz\u00e1rib\u00e1gh District (vol. v. pp. 376, 377). This system, however, was put an end to in the Sant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s by the late Sir George Yule, when Commissioner of the Bh\u00e1galpur Division, who ordered the cancellation of all kami\u00e1 bonds, and sent the kami\u00e1s to work upon the railway then under construction. The agricultural day-labourers, while finding their regular employment in working for others, are not, as a class, absolutely landless, and generally have small patches of cultivation of their own. Of such labourers there are two kinds, known as krish\u00e1ns and bhagi\u00e1r. The krish\u00e1n either uses his own agricultural implements and takes one-half of the produce, or uses his employer's implements and gets only one-third. In any case, the employer pays the rent and provides the seed. The bhagi\u00e1r works on less advantageous terms, as he not only contributes his personal labour and the use of his own agricultural implements, but also finds the seed, and only receives one-half of the produce.\n\nIn consequence of the enhanced demand for labour on the railway and public works, wages have risen materially of late years. Prices of food-grains and of all agricultural produce have also risen. Common rice in 1883\u201384 sold at the rate of $19\\frac{2}{3}$ sers per rupee, or 5s. 9d. per cwt.; and wheat at $14\\frac{1}{2}$ sers per rupee, or 7s. 9d. per cwt. These prices are rather above the average, owing to the year being one of deficient rainfall.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014Blight of a serious kind is not known in the Sant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s. Owing to the completeness of the natural drainage, floods are almost impossible over a large area; on the rare occasions on which the crops in the alluvial tract have been injured by flood, the loss thus caused was more than compensated by the increased yield of the high lands. Drought caused considerable distress in the Sant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s in 1866, and again in 1874. In the former year the price of rice rose in July to $7\\frac{1}{2}$ sers, and in August to $6\\frac{1}{2}$ sers for the rupee; in the latter year the highest price was $10$ sers. The fact of rice rising to $10$ or $14$ sers, or paddy to $20$ or $25$ sers,\nwould indicate the approach of famine, and relief measures would become necessary. It has been remarked that abundant crops of wild fruit are usually concomitants of famine years; and this was the case both in 1866 and in 1874. The *mah\u00fa\u00e1* tree, which is very common in the Sant\u00e1l highlands, yielded in 1874 a bounteous crop of edible blossoms and seeds; and the mango was also plentiful, and formed a sensible addition to the food supply of the people, who live much on wild fruits and herbs. In 1866, the people in this District, as in other parts of Behar, were forced by want to eat the mangoes while still unripe, and thousands of deaths by cholera were the result. In 1874, relief was afforded on such a scale that the fruit was allowed to ripen before being plucked, and there was no outbreak of disease.\n\n**Commerce and Trade, etc.**\u2014The trade of the District is carried on by means of permanent markets. The chief exports are rice, Indian corn, oil-seeds, *tasar*-silk cocoons, lac, small-sized timber, hill bamboos, and stone. The imports include European piece-goods, salt, and brass or bell-metal utensils for household use. The principal mart, both for railway and river trade, is *S\u00e1hibganj*, on the Ganges. This place is most favourably situated on the deep channel of the river, which flows at all seasons close under the town; and the railway station is quite near. *Rajmahal*, on the loop-line of the East Indian Railway, is another important mart. Both S\u00e1hibganj and R\u00e1jmah\u00e1l mainly depend upon their through traffic. They are, in fact, d\u00e9p\u00f4ts, where the agricultural produce of the trans-Gangetic Districts of Maldah, Purniah, and Bh\u00e1galpur is collected for transmission by rail to Calcutta. The manufactures of the District are insignificant. Iron is roughly smelted; coarse cloth is woven, silk-spinning is carried on, a few bell-metal utensils are made, and indigo is manufactured on a small scale. There are altogether about 500 miles of road in the Sant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s; and the District is traversed on the east by the loop-line, and on the west by the chord-line of the East Indian Railway\u2014the total length of both lines, including a portion of the small branch connecting Madhupur with the Karharb\u00e1ri collieries, being about 130 miles. Coal is found in the District, but of such inferior quality that all attempts made to work it have failed. Stone is quarried by an English firm under leases from Government and the *zamind\u00e1rs*, and exported down the Ganges to Calcutta for use as road-metal.\n\n**Administration.**\u2014In 1860-61, the total revenue of the Sant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s amounted to \u00a322,680, and the expenditure to \u00a316,845. In 1870-71 the revenue was \u00a338,901, and the expenditure \u00a314,391. In 1883-84 the five main items of Government revenue aggregated \u00a345,437, made up as follows:\u2014Land revenue, \u00a322,556; excise, \u00a311,758; stamps, \u00a39662; registration, \u00a3740; municipal taxes, \u00a3721. Cost of civil administration, \u00a316,438. Number of criminal,\ncivil, and revenue courts in 1870, 10; in 1883, 17. The Deputy Commissioner is also the District Judge.\n\nThe police of the Sant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s was organized in 1856 under what was called the 'no police' system, according to which the village officials alone perform police duties. The regular police system was, however, partially introduced in 1863-64; and in 1881 extended to the rest of the District, except the D\u00e1man-i-koh, and Dumk\u00e1 and Jamt\u00e1r\u00e1 Sub-divisions, where the village system still exists unimpaired. The reserve police force of Western Bengal, 100 strong, is now stationed at Dumk\u00e1, which has also become the training ground for the police of the western part of the Province, the police of other Districts being sent there to be drilled in batches of 10 men from 10 Districts at a time. In 1883 the regular and municipal police force numbered 392 men of all ranks, maintained at a total cost of \u00a36724. The rural police or village watch, including the Gh\u00e1tw\u00e1ls and Pah\u00e1ri\u00e1s, numbered 3891, maintained at an estimated cost in money or rent-free service lands of \u00a34868. The total machinery, therefore, for the protection of person and property consisted of 4283 men of all ranks, giving 1 man to every 127 square miles of area or to every 336 of the population. The total estimated cost was \u00a311,592, equal to an average of \u00a32, 2s. 6d. per square mile and 1\u00bed. per head of population. In 1883 the police conducted 3062 cases of all kinds, the proportion of convictions to persons brought to trial being 40\u00b76 per cent.\n\nD\u00e1k\u00e1ti or gang-robbery is very uncommon, the explanation being that the people of the District are so poor that there is no inducement to this particular crime. There was 1 jail and 1 lock-up in the Sant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s in 1883. The average daily jail population in the Dumk\u00e1 and Godda jails was 20 prisoners.\n\nEducation has made rapid strides in the Sant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s during the last few years. In 1864, there was not a single Government school in the District; in 1870-71, there were only 47; and in 1871-72, 42 Government and aided schools, attended by 1169 pupils. In 1872-73, owing to the admission of village paths\u00e1l\u00e1s to the benefit of the grant-in-aid rules, the number of Government and aided schools had risen to 101, with 2206 pupils. In 1883, when Sir George Campbell's education reforms had received their full development, the number of primary schools in the Sant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s under inspection by the Education Department had increased to about 975, with about 17,000 pupils. Of these, 148 were under missionary management. The Census Report of 1881 returned only 8850 boys and 504 girls as under instruction; besides 17,310 males and 661 females able to read and write, but not under instruction.\n\nFor administrative purposes, the Sant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s are divided into 6 Sub-divisions, namely, (1) Dumk\u00e1, (2) R\u00e1jmah\u00e1l, (3) Deogarh, (4)\nP\u00e1kaur, (5) Jamt\u00e1r\u00e1, and (6) Godda. There are 32 fiscal divisions (parganas) in the District. The gross municipal income of Deogarh and S\u00e1hibganj (the only municipalities in the Sant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s) amounted in 1883 to \u00a31216, of which \u00a3721 was derived from taxation; average incidence of taxation, 1s. per head of the population (14,296) within municipal limits.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate of the Sant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s varies in the different tracts which have been referred to in describing the physical features of the District. The alluvial strip of land has the damp heat and moist soil characteristic of Bengal; while the undulating and hilly portions are swept by the hot westerly winds of Behar, and resemble in their rapid drainage and dry subsoil the lower plateau of Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur. In this undulating tract the winter months are very cool, but the hot season is correspondingly trying. The average annual rainfall is 60'23 inches. Rainfall in 1883-84, 47'84 inches, or 12'39 inches below the average. No thermometrical returns are available. The prevailing endemic diseases of the District are fevers of the ordinary type, bowel complaints, and skin diseases. The hill tracts of R\u00e1jmah\u00e1l are very malarious. Epidemics of cholera and small-pox break out from time to time, but have been for the most part confined to the town of Deogarh. There are 5 charitable dispensaries in the Sant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s, which afforded medical relief in 1883 to 7569 in-door and out-door patients. [For further information regarding the Sant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s, see The Statistical Account of Bengal, by W. W. Hunter, vol. xiv. pp. 265 to 384 (Tr\u00fcbner, 1877); also the Bengal Census Report for 1881; and the several Administration and Departmental Reports of the Government of Bengal.]\n\nSant\u00e1ls, The.\u2014An aboriginal Kolarian tribe, inhabiting a tract of country forming a strip of Bengal; about 350 miles in length, extending from the Ganges at Bh\u00e1galpur to the Baitaran\u00ed river in Orissa. The Imperial Census Report of 1881 does not return the number of Sant\u00e1ls to be found throughout India; but, with the exception of a small body of about 7000, who have emigrated to Assam as coolies on the tea estates, or as labourers, and a few isolated cases of individuals scattered elsewhere, the whole Sant\u00e1l population inhabits the strip of Bengal above cited. The Census Report of Bengal for 1881 returns the total Sant\u00e1l population of the Province, excluding Christian converts, or any who may have embraced the faith of Isl\u00e1m, at 1,087,202, comprising Hindus 203,264, and non-Hindus 883,938. A little more than one-half, namely, 546,694, or 50'3 per cent. (of whom only 9148 are Hindus), are found in the single District of the Sant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s, which, however, as explained below, and in the District article, is not the original home of the race, but that in which they have settled during the present century. The following table, compiled from the Bengal Census\nReport of 1881, shows the distribution of the Sant\u00e1ls in the different Bengal Districts in 1881, classified into Hindus and non-Hindus:\n\n| DISTRICTS                  | Non-Hindus | Hindus | TOTAL   |\n|----------------------------|------------|--------|---------|\n| Sant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s            | 537,546    | 9,148  | 546,694 |\n| M\u00e1nbh\u00fam                    | 42,700     | 86,403 | 129,103 |\n| Midnapur                   | 112,062    | 565    | 112,627 |\n| B\u00e1nkur\u00e1                    | 84,559     | 20,034 | 104,593 |\n| Haz\u00e1r\u00edb\u00e1gh                 | 56,598     |        | 56,598  |\n| Singhbh\u00fam                  | 648        | 51,954 | 52,602  |\n| Birbh\u00fam                    | 14,172     | 726    | 14,898  |\n| Bh\u00e1galpur                  | 13,384     | 42     | 13,426  |\n| Bardw\u00e1n                    | 6,418      | 5,806  | 12,224  |\n| Monghyr                    | 6,938      |        | 6,938   |\n| Balasor                    | 4,206      | 339    | 4,545   |\n| Orissa Tributary States    | 633        | 922    | 1,555   |\n| Other Bengal Districts     | 4,074      | 27,325 | 31,399  |\n| **Grand Total**            | **883,938**| **203,264**| **1,087,202**|\n\nThe following paragraphs, quoted in a slightly condensed form from Colonel E. T. Dalton\u2019s *Descriptive Ethnology of Bengal*, describe generally the history of the Sant\u00e1ls, so far as ascertained, their physical appearance, habits, and mode of life:\n\n**History.**\u2014\u2018The Sant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s or Sant\u00e1l\u00eda, said to contain upwards of 200,000 Sant\u00e1ls [546,694 in 1881], may now be regarded as the nucleus of the Sant\u00e1l race, though it does not appear to have been one of their original seats. Dr. Buchanan-Hamilton, in describing the hill tribes of Bh\u00e1galpur and its vicinity, makes no mention of Sant\u00e1ls. The aboriginal tribes he fell in with are called \u201cMalairs,\u201d the R\u00e1jmah\u00e1l hill-men proper and their kindred, who are a Dravidian people. It is singular that no old colonies of Sant\u00e1ls or other Kolarian tribes are found between the Him\u00e1layas and the Ganges. The Sant\u00e1l Settlements that now border on that river or skirt the R\u00e1jmah\u00e1l hills are readily traced back to more southern Districts; and their own traditions hardly support the theory of their northern origin. Indeed, when we find that the Kolarian races have left their trail in Assam; that it may be followed throughout the Siam States and Burma to the Pegu District, and is faintly discerned in the adjoining islands; that it may be taken up at Point Palmyras and clearly traced along both banks of the D\u00e1modar river till it reaches the hills and table-land of Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur, \u2014it is scarcely reasonable to assume that they have all come direct from the Him\u00e1layas. The D\u00e1modar, rising in Pal\u00e1mau, divides the Haz\u00e1r\u00edb\u00e1gh and Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur plateaux, and draining the northern face of the one, and the southern face of the other, discharges itself\ninto the H\u00fagl\u00ed near the mouth of the latter river. It is the terrestrial object most venerated by the Sant\u00e1ls; and the country that is most closely associated with their name, which they apparently regard as their fatherland, is between that river and the Kas\u00e1i. There is no doubt, however, that Sant\u00e1ls colonized parts of Haz\u00e1rib\u00e1gh District and of B\u00edrbh\u00fam at a very remote period, and it is chiefly by migrations from these colonies that the modern Sant\u00e1l\u00eda has been formed.\n\n\u2018In 1832, a considerable impetus was given to the northward movement, in the action taken by Government to secure to the R\u00e1jmah\u00e1l highlanders their possessions in the hills that form the turning-point of the Ganges at S\u00e1hibganj. To prevent the encroachments of the lowland zamind\u00e1rs of Bh\u00e1galpur, which were constantly exciting reprisals from the highlanders, a tract of country measuring nearly 300 miles in circumference was separated and marked off by large masonry pillars. Of the land within these pillars the Government was declared to be direct proprietor, and the hill people were informed that their rights in it would be respected so long as they conducted themselves peaceably. But the hill-men only cared for the highlands; and the tract included within the pillars, called the D\u00e1man-i-koh or skirts of the hills, and the valleys running into the hills, were available for other settlers, and were speedily taken up by Sant\u00e1ls. In a few years the Sant\u00e1l population had increased from 3000 to 83,000 souls, when the colony received a check by the Sant\u00e1l insurrection of 1854.\n\n\u2018For a history of this rebellion, and the causes that led to it, the reader may be referred to the Annals of Rural Bengal. The Sant\u00e1ls, starting with the desire to revenge themselves on the money-lenders who had taken advantage of their simplicity and improvidence, found themselves arrayed in arms against the British Government. It was not without bloodshed that the insurrection was suppressed; but it led to their being re-established under a more genial administration in what are now called the Sant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s. In the D\u00e1man-i-koh, their own form of self-government is to some extent restored to them. The villages are farmed to the head-men, called m\u00e1njh\u00eds, who are also the sole guardians of the peace, a system that had been already introduced with success into the Kolh\u00e1n of Singhbh\u00fam.\n\nMigratory Habits.\u2014\u2018In marked contrast to the Kolarians of the Munda and Ho Divisions, the Sant\u00e1ls, as a rule, care little for permanently locating themselves. A country denuded of the primeval forest which affords them the hunting-grounds they delight in and the virgin soil they prefer, does not attract them; and when, through their own labour, the spread of cultivation has affected this denudation, they select a new site, however prosperous they may have been on the old, and retire into the backwoods, where their harmonious flutes sound\nsweeter, their drums find deeper echoes, and their bows and arrows may once more be utilized. The traditions of their ancient migrations are rendered obscure by the succession of dissolving views to which this nomadic habit introduces us, but they nevertheless tenaciously cling to a wild and remote tradition of their origin. Though much scattered and intermingled with other races whose creeds and customs they have partially adopted, they are still characterized by many old practices; and they are one of the tribes which has preserved the form of speech that in all probability predominated in the Gangetic Provinces before the Aryan conquest.\n\n\u2018But though prone to change, the Sant\u00e1ls are not indifferent to their personal comfort, and are more careful in the construction of their homesteads and villages than their cognates. Their huts, with carefully formed mud walls and well-raised plinths and snug verandahs, have a neat and, owing to their love of colour, even a gay appearance. They paint their walls in alternate broad stripes of red, white, and black,\u2014native clays and charcoal furnishing the pigments; moreover, the houses are kept perfectly clean, and, by means of partitions, decent accommodation for the family is provided.\n\n\u2018For the sites of their villages they generally seek isolation, and would gladly, if they could, exclude all foreigners, especially Br\u00e1hmans. But as they clear lands that they do not care to retain and render habitable\u2014regions that would otherwise be given up solely to wild beasts\u2014they are soon followed into their retreat by the more crafty and enterprising Hindus; and the result often is they have to submit to or give way to the intruders. It frequently happens that the Hindu immigrant, improving on the Sant\u00e1l cultivation, and making more money by it, obtains from the landlord a lease of the village at a rent the Sant\u00e1l would not think of paying, and so the pioneers of civilisation are prematurely forced to move on.\n\nPhysiognomy.\u2014\u2018The Sant\u00e1ls, like the Kh\u00e1rw\u00e1rs, belong to, or have mixed much with, the dark races of India. The Cheros, Hos, and Mundas are on the whole fairer, and possess more distinct traces of the Tartar type. The Sant\u00e1ls are noticeable for a great vagueness in the chiselling of the features, a general tendency to roundness of outline where sharpness is more conducive to beauty, a blubbery style of face, and both in male and female a greater tendency to corpulency than we meet in their cognates. Their faces are almost round; cheek-bones moderately prominent; nose of somewhat a retrouss\u00e9 style, but generally broad and depressed; mouth large, and lips very full and projecting; hair straight, and coarse, and black. Mr. Mann remarks of them, and I concur in the remark, that their cast of countenance almost approaches the Negro type. \u201cThe females,\u201d he says, \u201chave small hands and feet, and are ox-eyed, and these are\ncharacteristics which the tribes linguistically allied to them do not possess.\"\n\n*Tribal Divisions.*\u2014'The Sant\u00e1ls, like the Israelites, are divided into twelve tribes:\u2014(1) S\u00e1ran; (2) Murma; (3) Marl\u00ed; (4) Kisku; (5) Besera; (6) Handsa; (7) T\u00fadi; (8) Baski; (9) Hemrow; (10) Karw\u00e1r; (11) Chorai; (12) . . . . Except No. 11, the above agree with the nomenclature of tribal divisions of Sant\u00e1l tribes in Mr. Mann's work; numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 11 with the names of the seven sons of the first parents as given in the *Annals of Rural Bengal*. Numbers 2, 3, 6, 9, and 11 are found in the list of the tribes of the Singhbh\u00fam Larka Kols or Hos. This is remarkable, as the legends of origin handed down among the Larkas have little in common with the traditions of the Sant\u00e1ls. Though the former also assign twelve sons to the first parents, these were the primogenitors, not of the various *kilis* or tribes of Hos, but of different families of mankind, including Hindus and Sant\u00e1ls, the latter being the offspring of the youngest pair, who, when told to separate from the family, selected pig as their staple food. The names given above include only one to which a meaning is attached, viz. Murma, which signifies the *nilg\u00e1i* (Portax vel Antelope pictus); and the Murmas may not kill the animal whose name they adopt, nor touch its flesh.\n\n*Village Polity, Festivals, and Religion.*\u2014'The polity of the Sant\u00e1ls is very patriarchal. In each village there is (1) a *jag-m\u00e1njh\u00ed*, whose most important duty is apparently to look after the morals of the boys and girls; (2) a *par\u00e1m\u00e1nik*, whose business it is to attend to the farming arrangements, and to apportion the lands. He disallows any monopoly of peculiarly fertile rice lands; all must take their share of good and bad. He has to look after the interest of new settlers, and to provide for guests, levying contributions for that purpose on the villagers. All the offices are hereditary; when a new settlement is formed, the office-bearers are elected, after that the next of kin succeeds. (3) There is a village priest who is called *naiy\u00e1* (*nayaka*, vulgo *lay\u00e1*). This is a word of Sanskrit derivation, and as the Sant\u00e1ls have no name in their own language for such an office, it is probably not an original institution. He has lands assigned to him; but out of the profits of his estate he has to feast the people twice in the year at the festival of the *Sarh\u00fal*, held towards the end of March, when the *s\u00e1l* tree blossoms, and at the *Moi Muri* festival, held in the month of Aswin (September\u2013October), for a blessing on the crops. At the *Sohrai* feast, the harvest home, in December, the *jag-m\u00e1njh\u00ed* entertains the people, and the cattle are anointed with oil and daubed with vermilion, and a share of rice-beer (*h\u00e1ndia*) is given to each animal. Every third year in most houses, but in some every fourth or fifth year, the head of the family offers a goat\nto the sun-god, Singh Bonga, for the prosperity of the family, especially of the children, \"that they may not be cut off by disease, or fall into sin.\" The sacrifice is offered at sunrise, on an open space cleaned and purified for the occasion. A very important distinction is observed by all the Kolarians in the motives of the sacrifices to the supreme deity, and of those by which the minor gods are propitiated. To Singh Bonga the sacrifice is to secure a continuance of his mercies, and for preservation. The other deities are resorted to when disease or misfortune visits the family, the sacrifice being to propitiate the spirit who is supposed to be afflicting or punishing them.\n\n'Ancestors are worshipped, or rather their memory is honoured, at the time of the Sohrai festival, and offerings are made at home by each head of a family. In the meantime the naiy\u00e1 propitiates the local devils or bhuts. In many villages the Sant\u00e1ls join with the Hindus in celebrating the Durg\u00e1 P\u00faja, the great festival in honour of Devi, and the Holi, in honour of Krishna. Their own priests take no part in the ceremonial observances at those Hindu feasts, which are left to the Br\u00e1hmans.\n\n'The person or persons who have to offer sacrifices at the Sant\u00e1l feasts prepare themselves for the duty by fasting and prayer, and by placing themselves for some time in a position of apparent mental absorption. The beating of drums appears at last to arouse them; and they commence violently shaking their heads and long hair, till they work themselves into a real or apparent state of involuntary or spasmodic action, which is the indication of their being possessed. They may then give oracular answers to interrogatories regarding the future, or declare the will of the spirit invoked or about to be propitiated. When the demoniacal possession appears to have reached its culminating point, the possessed men seize and decapitate the victims, and pour the blood into vessels ready placed for its reception. Among the Sant\u00e1ls in Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur, Singh Bonga, or the sun, is the supreme god, the creator and preserver. The other deities are J\u00e1hir Era, Monika, and Marang B\u00far\u00fa, who are all malignant and destructive. In the eastern Districts the tiger is worshipped, but in R\u00e1mgarh only those who have suffered loss through that animal's ferocity condescend to adore him. If a Sant\u00e1l is carried off by a tiger, the head of the family deems it necessary to propitiate the B\u00e1gh Bh\u00fat, the tiger; and to be sworn on a tiger skin is the most solemn of oaths.\n\n'Sant\u00e1ls who, under the example and precept of Bengali Hindus, have abjured some practices considered impure by the latter, are called Sat Sant\u00e1ls, that is, pure Sant\u00e1ls; but there is a national antagonism between the Sant\u00e1ls and the Hindus that prevents any close fraternization or communion between the races. The Sant\u00e1ls are not over\nparticular about food, but nothing will induce them to eat rice cooked by a Hindu, or even by a Br\u00e1hman. Unfortunately, during the famine of 1866 this was not known to us. The cooks who prepared the food distributed at the relief centres were all Br\u00e1hmans, and it was supposed that this would suit all classes; but the Sant\u00e1ls kept aloof, and died rather than eat from hands so hateful to them. They have no tradition to account for this bitter feeling. The animosity remains, though its cause is forgotten.\n\nSocial Customs.\u2014'The Sant\u00e1l parents have to undergo purification five days after child-birth; a kind of gruel is prepared, and after a libation to Singh Bonga or Marang B\u00far\u00fa, it is served out to the mother and the other members of the family. An eldest son is always named after his grandfather, other children after other relations. The Sant\u00e1ls have adopted as a rite the tonsure of children, and do not appear to recognise the necessity for any other ceremonial observance till their marriage when adult. Child marriage is not practised.\n\n'There is no separate dormitory for the boys and girls in a Sant\u00e1l village. Accommodation is decorously provided for them in the house of the parents, but the utmost liberty is given to the youth of both sexes. The old people, though affecting great regard for the honour of the girls, display great confidence in their virtue. Unrestrained, they resort to markets, to festivals, and village dances in groups; and if, late in the evening, they return under escort of the young men who have been their partners in the dance or have played to them, no harm is thought of it.\n\nMusic.\u2014'The peculiar emblem of the Sant\u00e1ls should be the flute; they are distinguished from all people in contact with them by their proficiency on that instrument. Made of bamboo, not less than one inch in diameter, and about 2 feet in length, their flutes are equal in size to the largest of our concert flutes, and have deep rich tones. This faculty of playing the flute and a general knowledge of singing and dancing were, they say, imparted to them by their first parents; and it was also by their first parents that they were taught the mysteries of brewing rice-beer, and they therefore consider there can be no great harm in freely indulging in it.\n\nDances.\u2014'There is always reserved an open space in front of the jag-m\u00e1njh\u00ed's house as a dancing place. To this the young men frequently resort after the evening meal. The sound of their flutes and drums soon attract the maidens, who smooth and adjust their long hair, and, adding to it a flower or two, blithely join them. It is singular that, in this national amusement of the Sant\u00e1ls, we have handed down to us a most vivid living representation of one prominent scene in the sports of Krishna in Braja and Brind\u00e1ban. There is\nnothing in modern Hinduism that at all illustrates the animated scenes so graphically delineated in the Pur\u0101\u1e47as; but the description of the R\u0101sa dance in chapter xiii., book v., of the Vishnu Pur\u0101\u1e47a might be taken literally as an account of the Sant\u00e1l Jumhir. We have in both the maidens decked with flowers and ornamented with tinkling bracelets, the young men with garlands of flowers and peacocks' feathers, holding their hands and closely compressed, so that the breast of the girl touches the back of the man next to her, going round in a great circle, limbs all moving as if they belonged to one creature, feet falling in perfect cadence, the dancers in the ring singing responsive to the musicians in the centre, who, fluting, drumming, and dancing too, are the motive power of the whole, and form an axis of the circular movement. Thus, as the pivot for the dances, sometimes sported Krishna and his favourite companions, \"making sweet melody with voices and flutes;\" but more frequently they took their places in the ring, \"each feeling the soft pressure of two maidens in the great circling dance.\" We are told that Krishna, when he thought the lovely light of autumn propitious for the R\u0101sa dance, commenced singing sweet low strains in various measures, such as the Gop\u00eds (milkmaids) loved, and they, as soon as they heard the melody, quitted their homes and joined him. Just so, on a moonlight night, the Sant\u00e1l youth invite the Sant\u00e1l maidens. Professor Wilson, in his note on the passages of the Vishnu Pur\u0101\u1e47a referred to above, observes that the R\u0101s j\u0101tra is celebrated in various parts of India in the month of K\u00e1rtik (October), but that a circular dance of men and women does not form any prominent feature at these entertainments, and he doubts if it ever is performed. In the late autumn months the Kols and Ur\u00e1ons have numerous j\u0101tras, at which these circular dances are performed by thousands.\n\nMarriage Ceremonies.\u2014'With such freedom of intercourse, it follows that marriages are generally love matches, and, on the whole, happy ones; but it is considered more respectable if the arrangements are made by the parents or guardians, without any acknowledged reference to the young people. The price to be paid for the girl, averaging five rupees, with presents of cloths to her parents, having been determined on, a day is fixed for a preliminary feast, and afterwards for the marriage itself; and a knotted string, which shows the number of days that intervene, is kept as a memorandum. Each morning one of these knots is removed by the impatient lover, and, when the last is loosened, the bridegroom and his friends, with noisy music, set out for the abode of the bride. As they approach the village, the jag-m\u00e1njhi comes out to meet them, attended by women with water to wash the feet of the guests, who are then escorted to the house of the bride, and the two mingling together merrily sing, dance, and feast\nin front of the bride's chamber. At the last quarter of the night, the bridegroom makes his appearance, riding on the hips of one of his comrades, and soon after the bride is brought out by a brother or brother-in-law in a basket. Then comes the inevitable sindra d\u00e1n. The groom daubs his lady-love on the crown and brow very copiously with vermilion (sindur), and the assembled guests applaud with cries of hari bol. The bride and bridegroom, having fasted all day, now eat together, and this is supposed to be the first time that the girl has sat with a man at her food. It is creditable to the Kolarians that this custom has been retained through ages, notwithstanding the derision with which it is viewed by all Hindus. On the following day, before the party breaks up, the young people are thus admonished by one of the sages:\u2014\"Oh boy! oh girl! you are from this day forth to comfort each other in sickness or sorrow. Hitherto you have only played and worked (as directed), now the responsibility of the household duties is upon you; practise hospitality, and when a kinsman arrives wash his feet and respectfully salute him.\" No priest officiates at a Sant\u00e1l marriage. The social meal that the boy and girl eat together is the most important part of the ceremony. By this act the girl ceases to belong to her father's tribe, and becomes a member of her husband's family. Sant\u00e1ls seldom have more than one wife, and she is treated with most exemplary kindness and consideration. Should the husband be for any reason, as her barrenness, induced to seek a second partner during her lifetime, the first wife is never deposed from her position as head of the household; the second wife must obey her and serve her.\n\nHunting Expeditions.\u2014'A Sant\u00e1l in prosperous seasons leads a pleasant life. He is either busy with his cultivation, or playing his flute, or dancing with the girls, or engaged in the chase. He throws himself with ardour into the latter pursuit, and in hunting down beasts of prey he evinces great skill and powers of endurance and indomitable pluck. The Sant\u00e1ls have every year a great hunting festival, in which thousands take part. These expeditions are organized with as much care and forethought as if the hosts engaged in them were about to undertake a military campaign. They take place in the hot season, when the beasts have least cover to conceal themselves in. When the array of hunters reaches the ground on which operations are to commence, they form a line of beaters several miles in length, every man armed with a bow and arrows and a battle-axe, and accompanied by dogs, who, though ugly creatures to look at, appear, like their masters, to be endowed with a true hunting instinct. When they emerge from the woods on open spaces, the game of all kinds that are driven before them suddenly appear. Birds take wing and are beaten down with sticks or shot with arrows; quadrupeds, great and\nsmall, are similarly treated, and in this way deer, pig, jungle-fowl, peafowl, hare, etc., are bagged; but tigers and bears on these occasions of open warfare are generally avoided. These hunting excursions last for four or five days, and at the end of each day the Sant\u00e1ls feast merrily on the contents of their bags, and thoroughly enjoy themselves. The rule in regard to possession of an animal killed is that it belongs to him who first wounded it, no matter by whom the coup de gr\u00e2ce may have been inflicted.\n\n'The Sant\u00e1ls employed in the police force are very highly spoken of by an officer who long commanded them. They may not be expert detectives in tortuous cases; but in following up d\u00e1k\u00e1its, and attacking them when found, they are far superior to the ordinary Bengali constables, and many instances of their activity and pluck have been related to me. Living as they generally do on the edges of forests, their constitutions are proof against malaria, and they may be employed on outpost duty in localities that are deadly to most people. They have been thus utilized on the Grand Trunk Road in places where the jungle comes down to the road.\n\nDress.\u2014'The Sant\u00e1ls dress better than most of their cognates. This also, it appears, is derived from the instruction of their first parents, who appointed the size of the garments that were to be worn respectively by male and female, but omitted to teach their offspring how they were to be made. They have no weavers among their own people. The women wear ample s\u00e1ris, a large thick cloth, not less than six yards in length, with a gay red border. One-half of this forms the lower garment, secured at the waist, but not so as to impede the free action of the limbs; the other half is passed over the left shoulder, leaving the right shoulder, arm, and part of the breast free, and allowed to hang down in front. It is not, as with Hindu maidens, used also as a veil. The heads of young girls are generally uncovered, displaying a mass of black, rather coarse, but sometimes wavy hair, gathered into a large knob at one side of the back of the head, ornamented with flowers or with tufts of coloured silk.\n\n\"'Their arms, ankles, and throats,\" writes Colonel Sherwill, \"are each laden with heavy brass or bell-metal ornaments. I had a quantity of these ornaments weighed, and found that the bracelets fluctuated from two to four pounds; and the entire weight sustained by one of these belles was ascertained to be no less than thirty-four pounds of brass or bell-metal. The average may be estimated at about twelve pounds.\"\n\n'In Funeral Ceremonies the Sant\u00e1l varies from the practice of the Ho and Munda tribes. The body is borne away on a ch\u00e1rpa\u00ed or cot by kinsmen; and when it reaches a cross-road, some parched rice and cotton-seed are scattered about, as a charm against the\nmalignant spirits that might throw obstacles in the way of the ceremony. It is then taken to a funeral pile near some reservoir or stream, and placed on it. The son or brother is the first to apply fire to the body, by placing a piece of burning wood on the face of the corpse; and soon all that is left are ashes and a few charred fragments of bones of the skull, which are carefully preserved. Towards evening, it is customary for a man to take his seat near the ashes with a winnowing fan, in which he tosses rice till a frenzy appears to seize him, and he becomes inspired and says wonderful things. After the incremation, the immediate relatives of the deceased have to undergo a quarantine, as impure, for five days. On the sixth they shave themselves and bathe, and sacrifice a cock. In due course, the bones that have been saved are taken by the nearest of kin to the D\u00e1modar. He enters the stream bearing the sacred relics on his head in a basket; and selecting a place where the current is strong, he dips, and commits the contents of his basket to the water, to be borne away to the great ocean as the resting-place of the race. All inquirers on the subject appear to have arrived at the conclusion that the Sant\u00e1ls have no belief in a future state. The pilgrimage to the D\u00e1modar with the remains is simply an act of reverence and affection, unconnected with any idea that there is a place where those who have left this world may meet again. It is to be observed that when the Sant\u00e1ls in disposing of their dead differ from the Mundas, they approximate to the Br\u00e1hmanical custom. It is, in fact, a rough outline of the Br\u00e1hman ritual, and only wants filling in. The halting at cross-roads and the scattering of rice, the application of fire first to the head by a relation, the collecting of the charred bones, especially those of the head, are all included in the ceremonies enjoined on Br\u00e1hmans and orthodox Hindus. The Br\u00e1hman, like the Sant\u00e1l, carefully preserves the bones in an earthen vessel; he is ordered to bury them in a safe place till a convenient season arrives for his journey to the sacred river\u2014in his case, the Ganges\u2014where he consigns the vessel with its contents to the waters.'\n\nS\u00e1ntalpur-with-Ch\u00e1dchat.\u2014Native State in the Political Superintendency of P\u00e1lanpur, Gujar\u00e1t, Bombay Presidency. The two Sub-divisions of S\u00e1ntalpur and Ch\u00e1dchat together form an estate ruled by a number of petty chieftains. Bounded on the north by the Morw\u00e1ra and Suig\u00e1m estates, on the east by the States of W\u00e1r\u00e1hi and R\u00e1dhanpur, and on the south and west by the Rann of Cutch. The two estates measure together about 37 miles in length, and 17 miles in breadth. Area, 440 square miles. Population (1881) 20,466; estimated yearly revenue, \u00a33,500.

There are no rivers, but\nmany ponds exist, which in normal seasons retain water till March, when the inhabitants have to depend upon wells for their supply. Fever is common. The holders of this State are J\u00e1reja R\u00e1jputs, kinsmen of the R\u00e1o of Cutch, by whom the country was conquered about 400 years ago. The ruling family hold no sanad authorizing adoption; in matters of succession they follow the rule of primogeniture.

Lat. 30\u00b0 35' 30\" N., long. 72\u00b0 1' E.\n\nSaran.\u2014District in the Lieutenant-Governorship of Bengal, lying between 25\u00b0 40' and 26\u00b0 38' N. lat., and between 83\u00b0 58' and 85\u00b0 14' E. long. Area, 2622 square miles. Population (1881) 2,280,382 souls. Saran forms one of the north-western Districts of the Patna Division. It is bounded on the north by the District of Gorakhpur in the North-Western Provinces; on the east by the Bengal Districts of Champaran and Muzaffarpur, the boundary line being formed by the river Gandak; on the south by the Ganges, which separates it from Shahabad and Patna Districts; on the south-west by the District of Azimgarh in the North-Western Provinces, the Gogra forming the boundary line; and on the west again by Gorakhpur District. The administrative head-quarters are at Chapra, which is also the most populous town of the District.\n\nJurisdiction.\u2014Saran formerly constituted one District with Champaran. The revenue areas of the two Districts were not finally separated until 1866; but the magisterial jurisdictions were first divided in 1837. The Judge of Saran still holds sessions at Motihari in Champaran. The Sub-division of Sewan was opened in 1848, and a second Sub-division at Gopalganj was sanctioned in 1875.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014Saran forms a vast alluvial plain, bounded on three sides by the great rivers Ganges, Gandak, and Gogra (Ghagra), and intersected by numerous nadis or water-channels, which flow in a south-easterly direction, and carry off the drainage of the District. The rivers run on a higher level than the adjacent country, which is therefore liable to inundation when they overtop their banks. Beneath these high banks lie the basins in which the surface drainage primarily collects, to be discharged into the running channels at a lower stage in their course. The District has the shape of an isosceles triangle. The base, which is very irregular, lies to the north-west; one of the sides is formed by the Gandak, and the other by the Gogra and the Ganges; while the apex is at the south-east corner, where the Gandak and the Ganges join at Sonpur. From this spot, the levels slope very gently up towards the western parts of the District. Kochai Kot, in the north-west corner, is 222 feet above mean sea-level, while Sonpur is only 168 feet. The whole District is beautifully wooded, and mango-groves are very numerous. The lower levels are but sparingly used for rice cultivation; high rice lands predominate, and on these indigo, opium, wheat, barley, and several kinds of pulse are also grown. The soil is in many places saliferous, and saltpetre is extracted by the Nuniyas, a poor and hardy caste. There are no hills in Saran.\n\nThe only rivers which are navigable all the year round are the three\ngreat streams already mentioned\u2014the Ganges, Gandak, and Gogra. Among the smaller nad\u00eds, many of which dry up altogether in the hot weather, are the Sund\u00ed or D\u00e1h\u00e1, the Jhar\u00e1h\u00ed, the Gandak\u00ed, the Gangr\u00ed, the Dhan\u00e1\u00ed, and the Khats\u00e1, all of which ultimately fall into the Gogra or Ganges. Alluvion and diluvion are constantly taking place along the banks of the large rivers. One bank of the river, on which the current strikes, is generally high and abrupt, while the other is shelving; but these characteristics may be reversed in a short space of time. The high bank is gradually eaten away, and the current then turns to the opposite side, where a similar process is repeated. Large sandbanks form in the bed of the river one year and are swept away the next, sometimes making changes in jurisdiction necessary. Thus, in 1872, an alteration in the deep stream of the Ganges transferred seven alluvial estates (di\u00e1r\u00e1s) from S\u00e1ran to Azimgarh District in the North-Western Provinces. The drainage of the District is from north-west to south-east, and is carried off by the many small nad\u00eds into the larger streams. When the rainfall is unusually heavy, these nad\u00eds are unable to contain all the water, and large tracts of cultivated ground are inundated. The consequences are specially disastrous when the mouths of the nad\u00eds are stopped by high floods in the great rivers into which they flow.\n\nThere is very little jungle in S\u00e1ran, and hardly any forest products. The lac insect is found on the pipal tree, and it is estimated that about 200 maunds of the dye are annually exported. Shells are largely gathered for burning into lime. The minerals found in S\u00e1ran District are Glauber's salt (gulbar sora); and nodular limestone of excellent quality, which is locally used for metalling the roads, and is exported in large quantities to Patn\u00e1. Large game is not met with, although both tigers and leopards are said to have been at one time very common in the District. Wolves and wild hog are still numerous. Among the game birds found are quail, wild duck, snipe, plover, partridge, ortolans, and green pigeons. Snakes are very numerous. Crocodiles are common in the large rivers, and the rivers and marshes abound in fish.\n\nPopulation.\u2014Several early estimates were made of the population of S\u00e1ran. In 1800, a calculation based on an enumeration of the houses gave 1,104,000 as the number of inhabitants; but this included the present District of Champ\u00e1ran, which was not separated from S\u00e1ran until 1837. Estimates based on similar enumerations were made in 1843, 1847, 1854, 1855, and 1860, the earliest giving a population of 1,376,215, and the latest 1,271,729. The first accurate Census was that taken in 1872, which disclosed a total population of 2,063,860. The last enumeration in 1881 returned the population of S\u00e1ran District at 2,280,382, showing an increase of 216,522, or 10'49 per cent., in the nine years since 1872.\n\nThe results arrived at by the Census of 1881 may be summarized as\nfollows:\u2014Area of District, 2622 square miles, with 7 towns and 4372 villages. Number of houses, 376,787, namely, occupied 326,699, and unoccupied 50,088. Total population, 2,280,382, namely, males 1,083,765, and females 1,196,817; proportion of males, 47.4 per cent. The slight excess of females is due to emigration of males from the more thickly populated tracts, to seek labour elsewhere. As regards density, S\u00e1ran is the most thickly populated District within the Lieutenant-Governorship of Bengal (except the suburban District of Howrah), with an average pressure on the soil of 870 persons per square mile; as against 860 per square mile in Muzaffarpur, and 845 per square mile in Patn\u00e1, both neighbouring Districts. S\u00e1ran is one of the most purely agricultural Districts in Bengal, with a very fertile soil; and in tracts like the police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s) of Mashrak, Digw\u00e1r\u00e1, and M\u00e1njh\u00ed, with no towns or large trade centres, the density reaches the enormous average of 1240, 1134, and 1047 per square mile respectively. The most sparsely populated th\u00e1n\u00e1 is Bar\u00e1g\u00e1on, with an average of 689 per square mile. The number of villages over the whole District area averages 167 per square mile; persons per town or village, 521; houses per square mile, 143.7; inmates per house, 6.9. Classified according to sex and age, the population consists of\u2014under 15 years of age, boys 461,553, and girls 442,538; total children, 904,091, or 40 per cent. of the District population: 15 years and upwards, males 622,012, and females 754,279; total adults, 1,376,291, or 60 per cent.\n\nReligion.\u2014Classified according to religion, the Census Report of 1881 returns the Hindus at 2,010,958, or 88.2 per cent. of the population; Muhammadans, 269,142, or 11.8 per cent.; and Christians, 282. High-caste Hindus are strongly represented, numbering 579,800, or 25.3 per cent. of the total Hindu population, namely, Br\u00e1hmans, 173,362; Rajputs, 243,972; B\u00e1bhans, or zamind\u00e1ri Br\u00e1hmans, 84,733; K\u00e1yasths, 51,067; and Baniy\u00e1s, 26,666. The S\u00fadra or lower Hindu castes include the following:\u2014Go\u00e1l\u00e1, the herdsman caste, and the most numerous in the District, 256,513; Ko\u00e9r\u00ed, 150,354; Kandu, 120,310; Kurmi, 112,570; Cham\u00e1r, 111,144; Dos\u00e1dh, 79,593; Nuniy\u00e1, 68,720; Teli, 63,087; Loh\u00e1r, 42,057; K\u00e1h\u00e1r, 35,537; N\u00e1pit, 31,844; Kumbh\u00e1r, 24,594; Kalw\u00e1r, 23,979; Mallah, 22,1599; Son\u00e1r, 21,472; Bind, 19,127; Dhanuk, 17,801; Dhobi, 17,103; Barh\u00e1i, 16,936; Tatw\u00e1, 10,826; Baru\u00ed, 10,386; Gareri, 9881; Dom, 9506; M\u00e1li, 6909; Musah\u00e1r, 6465; and P\u00e1s\u00ed, 5562. Caste-rejecting Hindus are returned at 3476, of whom 2320 are Vaishnavs. Aboriginal tribes number 20,953, including 11,428 Gonds (?); but all are returned as professing Hinduism. The Muhammadan population, classified according to sect, consists of\u2014Sunn\u00eds, 231,533; Shi\u00e1s, 4072; and unspecified, 33,537. Of the 282 Christians, 138 are Europeans by race, 10 Eurasians, and 134 Natives of India. By sect, 71 belong to the Church of England, 43 are Roman Catholics, 31 Protestants.\nwithout distinction of sect, and 34 are Lutherans; other sects and unstated, 103. A branch of the Lutheran Evangelical Mission has been stationed in Chapra town since 1840. The majority of the native Christians are very poor, nearly all being cultivators, domestic servants, or labourers.\n\nTown and Rural Population.\u2014The Census Report returns 7 towns as containing upwards of five thousand inhabitants, namely, Chapra, population (1881) 51,670; Sewan, 13,319; Revelganj, 12,493; Panapur Chagwan, 6425; R\u00e1n\u00edpur Tengrahi, 6197; M\u00e1njhi, 6068; and Parsa, 5735. The total urban population thus disclosed is 101,907, or 4\u00b74 per cent. of the District population. Only the three first-named places, however, are towns in any sense of the word, and they constitute the only municipalities within the District. The other places are merely large villages or collections of hamlets, in the midst of which are conducted all the operations of agricultural life. The income of the three municipalities in 1883\u201384 amounted to \u00a35302, of which \u00a33556 was derived from taxation; average incidence of taxation, 11d. per head of the population (76,942) within municipal limits.\n\nOf the 4372 villages, 1209 contain less than two hundred inhabitants; 1696 between two and five hundred; 989 between five hundred and a thousand; 392 between one and two thousand; 65 between two and three thousand; and 21 between three and five thousand inhabitants.\n\nAs regards occupation, the Census divides the male population into the following six classes:\u2014(1) Professional and official class, 14,915; (2) domestic servants, inn and lodging-house keepers, etc., 27,432; (3) commercial class, including merchants, traders, carriers, etc., 26,640; (4) agricultural and pastoral class, including gardeners, 479,076; (5) manufacturing and industrial class, including all artisans, 62,040; and (6) indefinite and non-productive class, comprising general labourers and all male children, 473,462.\n\nThe Material Condition of the People can hardly be good in a densely crowded agricultural District like S\u00e1ran. The District is unusually fertile, and almost every available acre highly cultivated. The larger husbandmen, and classes who hold at privileged rates of rent, are enabled to live in comfort in ordinary good seasons. But, considering the rise of rents in late years, it is doubtful whether the great body of cultivators, in spite of the general rise in prices of grain, are better off than formerly. In many parts of the District, too, the increasing number of indigo factories, and the demand for land on this account, are said to have further unfavourably affected their condition. The wealthier classes live in brick houses; the country shopkeepers and husbandmen in mud huts. The better class of houses in the town of Chapra have a verandah, often ornamented with carvings in wood. The house of an ordinary cultivator consists of three or four rooms,\nwith an outer and an inner verandah; and sometimes a covered place in the centre, where the family sit and receive visitors. The huts of the poorest classes are of a very primitive character, and consist merely of walls of common thatching grass, with a thin roof of the same materials, supported by a few bamboos. Gol\u00e1s or granaries for keeping rice are common. The estimated living expenses for a household of six members belonging to a well-to-do shopkeeper is estimated at about \u00a31, 7s. per month; and for a similar family of the ordinary cultivating class, at a little below \u00a31 a month, at the ordinary market prices. The husbandman, however, himself produces nearly all his food requirements; and he very seldom has to purchase anything beyond cloth and salt in the b\u00e1z\u00e1r.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Rice is, perhaps, the most important crop grown in S\u00e1ran; though the area under rice is largely exceeded by the collective area under such inferior grains as makai, kodo, and maru\u00e1. It consists of two great harvests\u2014the bhadai or autumn harvest, and the agh\u00e1n\u00ed or winter harvest, the latter being by far the larger of the two. The bhadai is generally sown broadcast on high ground in June, and reaped in September. Its chief varieties are, (1) sath\u00ed, (2) sarha, (3) katki or munga, and (4) karh\u00e1ni. Agh\u00e1n\u00ed rice is sown on low ground. In June, after rain has fallen, a nursery is selected, and ploughed three or four times before the seed is sown. It is afterwards transplanted, and is harvested in December or January. The 33 principal varieties of this rice are as follows:\u2014(1) Bhoinsloti, (2) kanug\u00e1, (3) kh\u00e1h\u00e1, (4) j\u00e1gar, (5) senegra, (6) jasari\u00e1, (7) thanom\u00ed, (8) s\u00e1ro, (9) ser\u00e1, (10) sall\u00e1, (11) shakhjir\u00e1, (12) kalunji, (13) s\u00e1tul, (14) sel\u00e1, (15) l\u00e1nji, (16) batar\u00e1n\u00ed, (17) k\u00e1jri, (18) l\u00e1ld\u00e1na, (19) umath, (20) rathgoli, (21) dachni, (22) bellaur, (23) baharni, (24) b\u00e1nsmati, (25) s\u00e1mjir\u00e1, (26) j\u00e1gar, (27) khera, (28) r\u00e1s, (29) pah\u00e1ri\u00e1, (30) singh\u00e1r, (31) sy\u00e1msundar, (32) karanga, and (33) gajpatta.\n\nThe other cereals cultivated are wheat, barley, and Indian corn. Green crops comprise matar or peas, khesari, gram, arhar, mug, urid, beans, sweet potatoes, mustard-seed, etc. Cotton, hemp, and flax are also grown. P\u00e1n or betel-leaf is generally cultivated on high land situated near a well or tank, in the vicinity of the homestead. Special crops comprise tobacco, sugar-cane, indigo, and opium; the latter being cultivated only under Government licence. The total area under indigo is (1884) estimated at 48,750 acres, yielding an average out-turn of 10,250 cwts., valued at \u00a3315,000. The total area under poppy is about 48,700 acres, with a yield of 733,360 lbs. Manure is used whenever it can be procured, and irrigation is largely practised for the cold-weather crops.\n\nThe poorer class of cultivators are, as a rule, deeply in debt. Rents are high, the following being returned as the average rates throughout\nthe District:\u2014Transplanted rice, 9s. 6\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\)d. per acre; broadcast rice, 6s. 9d.; Indian corn, wheat, maru\u00e1, arhar, and cotton, 11s. 3d.; kodo, barley, and pulse, 9s. 5\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)d.; poppy, 15s. 8d.; indigo, 10s. 4\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)d.; and sugar-cane, 9s. 11d. It is very common to find Br\u00e1hmans, B\u00e1bhans, R\u00e1jputs, and other high castes holding the best lands in a village at rates varying from 50 to 75 per cent. below what a low-caste man pays for inferior land. Rents are now almost invariably paid in money, instead of in kind, as was formerly common. As a general rule, the cultivators claim to hold under a right of occupancy, but such tenures are rarely transferable, except with permission of the landlord. Tenants holding their lands without liability to enhancement do not number more than 5 per cent. of the whole. Wages have increased about 30 per cent. of late years. The rates for ordinary day-labourers vary from 3d. to 4\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)d. per day, according as they are employed in the country or the town; women and boys receive from 2d. to 3d. per day. Bricklayers and blacksmiths get from 6d. to 7\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)d. a day; sawyers, 6d.; and carpenters, from 4\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)d. to 7\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)d. a day. Prices of food-grains have risen in like proportion. In 1882\u201383, which may be taken as an ordinary year, 40 lbs. of common rice could be obtained for the rupee; while in 1883\u201384, a year of deficient rainfall, the price rose to 31\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) lbs. for the rupee. In 1877\u201378, when scarcity prevailed owing to an ill-distributed rainfall and excessive exportation to Southern India, only 27 lbs. of rice were to be got for the same money. Old records show that in 1790 the price was 150 lbs. for the rupee.\n\n**Natural Calamities.**\u2014The District is subject to blight, flood, and drought. The most common kind of blight is called hind\u00e1, a mildew which attacks wheat and barley. Insects do considerable damage; and also hailstorms in the cold weather. S\u00e1ran District, being bounded on two sides by large rivers, which flow on ridges and carry enormous volumes of water, is peculiarly exposed to inundation. The northern side of the District is now, however, completely protected by the Gandak embankment. Towards the south, along the banks of the Ganges and Gogra, protective works are still required, as large tracts are inundated nearly every year. The old records are full of complaints about these inundations, which in many cases rendered a remission of revenue necessary. The most noteworthy floods of late years occurred in 1871 and 1874. Droughts have occurred several times, the worst known having taken place in 1866 and 1874, both of which were caused by the failure of the local rainfall. During the scarcity of 1874, relief works on an extensive scale were undertaken by Government, and in the first fortnight of June a daily average of 229,885 persons were employed in road-making. Advances of grain were made to the extent of 324,831 maunds. Prices were kept down, however, by Government importations, and the highest rate reached for common\nrice in 1874 was 12s. 1\u00bdd. per cwt., as against \u00a31, 1s. 10d. per cwt. in 1866. To remedy this liability to drought, a scheme of irrigation was commenced in 1878, by which the waters of the Gandak are now led through the centre of the District. The total cost amounted to \u00a370,000, on which sum a few planters and zamindars have guaranteed interest at the rate of 4 per cent. The total irrigated area is estimated at 163,800 acres.\n\nMeans of Communication, Trade, etc.\u2014The District possesses a total length of 926 miles of made road; and the Bengal North-Western Railway (opened in 1884) runs east and west through the District, with stations at Sonpur, Chapr\u00e1, Sew\u00e1n, and Mairwa. The principal manufactures are indigo, sugar, brass-work, pottery, saltpetre, and cloth. The chief exports from S\u00e1ran are oil-seeds, indigo, saltpetre, sugar, and grain of all sorts, except rice; the principal articles of import are rice, salt, and European piece-goods. The great trading mart of the District is Revelganj. In 1876\u201377, the total registered river traffic of S\u00e1ran District, including both imports and exports, amounted to just two millions sterling. A great portion of this total is merely through traffic, which comes down from Oudh and the North-Western Provinces, and changes boat at Revelganj and Semuria, on its way to Patn\u00e1 or Calcutta. Revelganj is perhaps the largest mart for oil-seeds (chiefly linseed) in all India. In 1876\u201377, the total registered import of oil-seeds into the District was valued at \u00a3265,000; the total export was \u00a3370,000, thus leaving a balance of more than \u00a3100,000 for the local produce. As regards food-grains, however, the figures show decisively that S\u00e1ran is unable to supply its own dense population. In 1876\u201377, the imports of food-grains of all kinds were valued at \u00a3326,000, as compared with exports valued at only \u00a3118,000. The other principal items of export were indigo (\u00a3179,000), and saltpetre and other saline substances (\u00a367,000). Salt was imported to the value of \u00a3143,000. Owing to an alteration in the system of collecting trade statistics, later figures than those for 1876\u201377 are not available.\n\nAdministration.\u2014In 1794, the net revenue of the District (which then included Champ\u00e1ran) amounted to \u00a3195,254, with a civil expenditure of \u00a327,496; in 1850\u201351, the revenue (still including Champ\u00e1ran) was \u00a3230,567, with an expenditure of \u00a324,131; in 1870\u201371 (after the separation of Champ\u00e1ran), the net revenue of S\u00e1ran alone was \u00a3185,072, with an expenditure of \u00a343,826. In 1883\u201384, the six main items of Government revenue aggregated \u00a3203,734, made up as follows:\u2014Land revenue, \u00a3122,612; excise, \u00a334,362; stamps, \u00a326,086; registration, \u00a32492; road cess, \u00a314,625; municipal taxes, \u00a33557. Cost of officials and police of all kinds, \u00a324,532. The total number of estates in S\u00e1ran District in 1883\u201384 was 4207, with 45,593 registered proprietors or coparceners; average\npayment from each estate, \u00a327, 2s. 10d., or from each individual proprietor, \u00a32, 13s. 9d.\n\nFor administrative, police, and fiscal purposes, S\u00e1ran District is divided into three Sub-divisions and ten police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), as follows:\u2014(1) Head-quarters Sub-division, with the five th\u00e1n\u00e1s of Chapr\u00e1, M\u00e1njh\u00ed, Parsa, Mashrak, and Dighwara; (2) Gop\u00e1lganj Sub-division, with the two th\u00e1n\u00e1s of Gop\u00e1lganj and Bar\u00e1g\u00e1o\u0144; and (3) Sew\u00e1n Sub-division, with the three th\u00e1n\u00e1s of Sew\u00e1n, Darauli, and Basantpur. Seven judges and 9 stipendiary magistrates. The regular and town police force in 1883 consisted of 539 officers and men, maintained at a cost of \u00a39443, being an average of 1 policeman to every 4'8 square miles and to every 4230 of the population. Besides, the village watch or rural police numbered 5327 men, maintained, either by the zam\u00edn\u00e9d\u00e1rs or by service lands held rent-free, at an estimated total cost of \u00a310,326 a year. Each village watchman has charge of 66 houses on an average, and receives an average pay in money or lands of \u00a31, 18s. a year. There are 2 jails in the District, at Chapr\u00e1 and Sew\u00e1n towns, with a daily average prison population in 1883 of 262; the total admissions being 2134. The principal criminal classes are the Dos\u00e1dhhs, Go\u00e1l\u00e1s or Ah\u00edrs, and Maghya Doms.\n\nEducation has rapidly progressed since the introduction of Sir George Campbell\u2019s educational reforms in 1872. In 1870\u201371 there were only 9 Government or aided schools in the District, attended by 585 pupils. At the close of the year 1873\u201374 the inspected schools numbered 326, with 7066 pupils. In 1883\u201384 there were upwards of 1525 inspected schools, attended by about 18,000 pupils. The zil\u00ed school at Chapr\u00e1 town had 388 pupils on the 31st March 1884. The Census Report of 1881 returned 19,452 boys and 631 girls as under instruction, besides 31,732 males and 1024 females able to read and write, but not under instruction.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The seasons in S\u00e1ran are very similar to those of Tirh\u00fat, but perhaps a little hotter. The hot weather begins about the end of March; and in a fortnight afterwards, hot westerly winds begin to blow during the day. At night, the wind comes generally from the east, and the temperature is comparatively cool, being lowered by occasional thunderstorms. The rains set in about the middle of June, and continue, with intermissions, till about the end of September or the middle of October. September is by far the most trying month of the year; the air is damp and steamy, while the sun\u2019s rays are extremely strong. The cold weather begins about the middle of October, and continues till the beginning of March. Average annual rainfall at Chapr\u00e1 town, 39'43 inches. No thermometrical returns are available. The prevailing diseases are cholera, small-pox, fever, and dysentery. The civil surgeon states that it is doubtful if cholera\nis ever really absent from the District; and it commits great ravages towards the end of the hot and beginning of the rainy season. Small-pox comes next in intensity, but the people are beginning to avail themselves of vaccination. Both these diseases are said to be now on the decrease, owing to the improved habits of the people and the high state of cultivation. The people who live in the neighbourhood of low rice lands suffer a good deal from fever. Dysentery, the result of bad water and insufficient clothing, is sometimes very severe. Six Government charitable dispensaries afforded medical relief in 1883 at Chapr\u00e1, Sew\u00e1n, Hatw\u00e1, Bhori, Gop\u00e1lganj, and Revelganj to 60,243 patients. Cattle disease exists in the form of guti or rinderpest, and kurh\u00e1 or foot-and-mouth disease. [For further information regarding S\u00e1ran, see *The Statistical Account of Bengal*, by W. W. Hunter, vol. xi. pp. 225-371 (London, Tr\u00fcbner & Co., 1877); the *Bengal Census Report* for 1881; and the several Administration and Departmental Reports of the Bengal Government.]\n\n**S\u00e1ran.** \u2014 Head-quarters Sub-division of S\u00e1ran District, Bengal. \u2014 See Chapra.\n\n**S\u00e1rand\u00e1.** \u2014 Hill range in the extreme south-west corner of Singhbh\u00fam District, bordering on Gangpur State, Bengal. Consists of a grand mass of mountains, rising to the height of 2738 feet, known as 'S\u00e1rand\u00e1 of the seven hundred hills.' The population inhabiting this region is scattered over a few poor hamlets nestling in deep valleys, and belongs for the most part to one of the least reclaimed tribes of Kols.\n\n**S\u00e1rand\u00e1.** \u2014 One of the p\u00edrs or groups of villages of the Kolh\u00e1n, in Singhbh\u00fam District, Bengal. According to the Census of 1881, the p\u00edr contains 88 villages, assessed at a Government revenue of \u00a358. Lat. 22\u00b0 1' 15\" to 22\u00b0 30' N., long. 85\u00b0 2' to 85\u00b0 28' E.\n\n**S\u00e1rangarh.** \u2014 Native State attached to Sambalpur District, Central Provinces, formerly one of the Ath\u00e1ra Garhj\u00e1t or 'Eighteen Forts;' lying between 21\u00b0 21' and 21\u00b0 45' N. lat., and between 82\u00b0 59' and 83\u00b0 31' E. long. Bounded on the north by the Chandrapur chiefship and R\u00e1igarh State, on the east by Sambalpur District, on the south by the Phuljhar chiefship, and on the west by Bil\u00e1spur District. Population (1881) 71,274 (of whom 63,231 were Hindus), residing in 442 villages and 25,406 houses. Area, 540 square miles, of which 320 were cultivated in 1877, while of the portion lying waste 80 square miles were returned as cultivable. Density of population, 132 persons per square mile.\n\nThe country is generally level, but in the south and east rise two considerable ranges of hills. The Mah\u00e1nadi flows through the north of the State and affords water communication for a length of 50 miles; the only other river worth mention is the L\u00e1th. Though no large\nforests remain, patches of s\u00e1j, dh\u00far\u00e1, tend\u00ed, etc. are met with here and there. Bison, formerly numerous, have now abandoned the State; but tigers, bears, and leopards still range the hills and jungle. The soil is for the most part light and friable, with a strong admixture of sand. Rice forms the staple crop; but pulses, oil-seeds, sugar-cane, cotton, and a little wheat are also produced. The only manufactures are tasar-silk and coarse cotton cloth; and though iron-ore abounds, no mines are worked.\n\nThe chief is a Gond, and traces his origin through 54 generations up to Jagdeva S\u00e1, a son of Narendra S\u00e1, R\u00e1j\u00e1 of L\u00e1nj\u00ed in Bhand\u00e1r\u00e1 about 91 A.D. In return for military assistance, Narsingh Deva, R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Ratanpur, presented Jagdeva S\u00e1 with a khilat or personal mark of distinction, and conferred on him the title of d\u00edw\u00e1n, together with 84 villages in the S\u00e1rangarh tract. Forty-two generations later, when Kaly\u00e1n S\u00e1 was d\u00edw\u00e1n, Raghuji Bhonsla of N\u00e1gpur was stopped on his way to Cuttack by the Phuljhar people, who held the Singhora Pass against him. Raghuji applied to Banoj\u00ed, R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Ratanpur, who directed Kaly\u00e1n S\u00e1 to clear the pass. For this service, Kaly\u00e1n S\u00e1 received the title of R\u00e1j\u00e1, with the right to carry a standard. The title was confirmed by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Chhatra S\u00e1 of Sambalpur, when S\u00e1rangarh became a dependency of his kingdom; and by their military assistance from time to time to the Sambalpur princes, succeeding R\u00e1j\u00e1s of S\u00e1rangarh gained further grants of villages and pargan\u00e1s, and gradually made S\u00e1rangarh a State of some importance. The only remarkable building in the State is the temple of Samleswar Deva, erected in 1748 by Aditya S\u00e1 D\u00edw\u00e1n. Sangr\u00e1m Singh, the late R\u00e1j\u00e1, established a good school at his chief town, and there are also indigenous schools in other parts. During the minority of the present R\u00e1j\u00e1, Bhaw\u00e1n\u00ed Prat\u00e1p Singh, the State has been under British management. The young chief, who was educated at the R\u00e1jkumar College at Jabalpur, attained his majority in 1885. The tribute is \u00a3135; revenue (1883\u201384), \u00a33850. The climate is unhealthy, and fever prevails widely from September to November.\n\nS\u00e1rangarh.\u2014Chief town of S\u00e1rangarh State, Central Provinces, and residence of the R\u00e1j\u00e1. Population (1881) 4220, namely, Hindus, 3638; Kab\u00edrpanth\u00eds, 35; Muhammadans, 230; and non-Hindu aborigines, 317.\n\nSarangpur.\u2014Town in Dew\u00e1s State, Central India Agency; situated on the right bank of the K\u00e1li Sind river, on the trunk road between G\u00fana and Indore, 92 miles from the former, and 80 miles from the latter. Population (1881) 13,543, namely, males 6610, and females 6933. Hindus number 8776; Muhammadans, 4737; and 'others,' 30.\n\nSaraspur (Sarishpur or Siddheswar).\u2014Hill range in the south of\nAssam, forming the boundary between Cachar District on the east and Sylhet on the west. The height varies from 600 feet to 2000 feet above sea-level. At Badarpur, at the northern extremity of the range, is an ancient temple dedicated to Siva, who is worshipped under the name of Siddheswar (Lord of the Pure). An annual fair takes place here, which is numerously attended.\n\nSaraswat\u00ed (Sarsut\u00ed).\u2014Sacred river of the Punjab, famous in the early Br\u00e1hmanical annals. Rises in lat. $30^\\circ 23'$ N., long. $77^\\circ 19'$ E., just beyond the British border, in the low hills of Sirmur (Sarmor) State; emerges upon the plain at Zadh Budri in Amb\u00e1la (Umballa), a place esteemed sacred by all Hindus; flows in a general south-westerly direction, and loses itself more than once in the sands, but reappears again with little diminished volume; passes by the holy town of Thanesar and the numerous shrines of the Kurukshetra, a tract celebrated as a centre of pilgrimages, and as the scene of the battle-fields of the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata; enters Karn\u00e1l District and Pati\u00e1la State, where it finally joins the Ghaggar (lat. $29^\\circ 51'$ N., long. $76^\\circ 5'$ E.).\n\nIn ancient times, the united stream below the point of junction appears to have borne the name of Sarsut\u00ed, and, undiminished by irrigation near the hills, to have flowed across the R\u00e1jput\u00e1na plains, debouching into the Indus below its confluence with the Punjab rivers. The deserted bed can still be traced as far as Mirgarh in Bah\u00e1walpur; but the water now penetrates no farther than Bhatner in R\u00e1jput\u00e1na, where its trickling streams finally disappear by evaporation. The numerous dams across the hill torrents at the foot of the mountains probably account for the drying up of the ancient channel.\n\nThe name of Saraswat\u00ed, \u2018the river of pools,\u2019 sufficiently describes the character of the stream in its upper portion, where it dries up partially in the early months of the year, becoming a mere succession of separate ponds. To each of these is attached a legend and a shrine, visited by thousands of pilgrims every year. According to Hindu legend, the disappearance of the Saraswat\u00ed in the sands is accounted for as follows:\u2014Saraswat\u00ed was the daughter of Mah\u00e1deo; but her father one day, in a drunken fit, approaching her with the intention of violating her modesty, the Hindu Arethusa fled, and dived underground whenever she saw her pursuer gaining upon her; and the river, which sprang up in her track, still disappears underground at the self-same spots. By devout Hindus the Saraswat\u00ed is supposed to flow in a subterranean course till it joins the Ganges and the Jumna (Jamun\u00e1) at Allahabad, where the moisture on the walls of the crypt in the temple of the Undying Banian tree forms a conclusive proof of its existence in the eyes of the faithful. The real direction of the Saraswat\u00ed basin, however, lies towards the Indus below Mith\u00e1nkot. Some of the earliest Aryan settlements in India were on the banks of the Saraswati, and the\nsurrounding country has from almost Vedic times been held in high veneration. The Hindus identify the river with Sarasvat\u00ed, the Sanskrit Goddess of Speech and Learning. [See Muir's Orig. Sanskrit Texts, vol. i., many passages (ed. 1868); General Cunningham's Anc. Geog. Ind. pp. 331-33 (ed. 1871); Prof. Dowson's Dict. Hindu Mythol. p. 284 (ed. 1879); and article INDIA, ante, Vol. vi.]\n\nSarasvat\u00ed.\u2014Silted up channel in H\u00fagl\u00ed District, Bengal. Formerly the main stream of the Ganges, and navigable by large vessels as far as SATGAON, the royal port of Bengal, from the earliest historical times up to the 16th century. At one time, this was a broad river flowing between high banks, at places 600 feet apart. It carried the main body of what is now the H\u00fagl\u00ed, and enjoyed religious honours as the true continuation of the Ganges. According to Sanskrit legend, the sanctifying waters of the Sarasvat\u00ed enter the Jumna at Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d, and leave the Ganges at Tribeni Gh\u00e1t, 36 miles above Calcutta, in lat. 22\u00b0 59' N., and long. 88\u00b0 26' 45\" E. By the beginning of the 16th century, the Sarasvat\u00ed mouth had so far silted up, that the Portuguese abandoned S\u00e1tg\u00e1on, and established a new port of their own a few miles lower down the H\u00fagl\u00ed at Gholgh\u00e1t, which grew up into H\u00fagl\u00ed town. At the present day, the Sarasvat\u00ed at Tribeni is a mere tidal ditch. The site of S\u00e1tg\u00e1on is left high and dry, but remains of old ships have been frequently discovered buried many feet in the ground. The course of the dead river can still be traced to the south-west of Tribeni by a series of pools and marshes, until after throwing off a branch into the Damod\u00e1r near Ampt\u00e1, the main stream regains its character of a navigable channel near S\u00e1nkrel in Howrah District, where it re-enters the H\u00fagl\u00ed a short distance below the Calcutta Botanical Gardens.\n\nSaraswat\u00ed.\u2014River of Western India, rising in Mount Abu, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. Flowing through the P\u00e1lanpur and R\u00e1dhanpur States of the Mahi K\u00e1ntha Agency, and through the Patan Sub-division of Baroda State, the Saraswat\u00ed, after a south-westerly course of over 100 miles, enters the Rann of Cutch to the east of the State of that name. In the vicinity of Sidhpur and Patan towns, by which the river passes, the Saraswat\u00ed is said to have a subterranean course of several miles, reappearing before it enters the R\u00e1dhanpur territory. The river is fordable almost everywhere; its banks and bed are generally sandy; it is nowhere navigable. The only importance of the Saraswat\u00ed consists in its sanctity. It is visited by Hindus, especially those who have lost their mothers; Sidhpur on this river being considered the appropriate place to perform rites in honour of a deceased mother, as Gay\u00e1 in Behar is assigned for ceremonies in honour of a deceased father.\n\nS\u00e1ra\u0301th\u00e1.\u2014Port on the S\u00e1ra\u0301th\u00e1 river, in Balasor District, Orissa. Lat. 21\u00b0 34' 45\" N., long. 87\u00b0 8' 16\" E. Frequented by native rice\nsloops, the river being navigable as far as Nalitagarh, 8 miles from the sea. The sister port of S\u00e1r\u00e1th\u00e1 is Chhanuya.\n\nSarath Deogarh.\u2014Sub-division and town in the Sant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s, Bengal.\u2014See Deogarh.\n\nSarauli.\u2014Village in Khakreru tahsil, Fatehpur District, North-Western Provinces; situated in lat. $25^\\circ 40' 21''$ N., long. $81^\\circ 0' 19''$ E., $4\\frac{1}{2}$ miles from Khakreru town, and 22 miles from Fatehpur. Population (1881) 3228; prevailing caste, Lodh\u00e1s.\n\nSar\u00e1yan.\u2014River of Oudh. Rising in Kheri District in lat. $27^\\circ 46'$ N., and long. $80^\\circ 32'$ E., after a course of 49 miles in a south-easterly direction it enters Sit\u00e1pur District, where it receives the Jamw\u00e1ri on its left bank, in lat. $27^\\circ 32'$ N., and long. $80^\\circ 47'$ E. Thence it flows for about 3 miles in a north-westerly course, and, resuming its previous direction, joins the Gumti in lat. $27^\\circ 9'$ N., and long. $80^\\circ 55'$ E. Total length, about 95 miles. It causes destructive floods in some years, as it drains a considerable area of country with its numerous affluents.\n\nS\u00e1rda.\u2014River of North-Western India and Oudh. Rising in the loftier ranges of the Him\u00e1layas, which separate Kum\u00e1un from Tibet, at an altitude of 18,000 feet, it debouches from the hills at Barmdeo, 148 miles from its source, in lat. $29^\\circ 6'$ N., and long. $80^\\circ 13'$ E., at an altitude of 847 feet above sea-level. The river is here 450 feet broad, with a minimum discharge of 5600 cubic feet per second. Shortly after leaving Barmdeo, it divides into several channels, which reunite 9 miles farther down at Banb\u00e1sa, but again separate, and finally join at Mundi\u00e1 Gh\u00e1t, 168 miles from its source, where the last rapids occur, and the stream becomes an ordinary river of the plains. Eleven miles lower down, it touches British territory in Khairigarh pargan\u00e1, Oudh; and 11 miles farther on, or 190 miles from its source, it joins the Chauka near Mothia Gh\u00e1t. From this point the united stream takes the name of the Chauk\u00e1, till it falls into the Gogra on its right bank, in lat. $27^\\circ 9'$ N., and long. $81^\\circ 30''$ E.\n\nSard\u00e1r Shahr (Sird\u00e1r Shir).\u2014Town in Bikaner (Bickaneer) State, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na; situated about 75 miles north-east of Bikaner town. Population (1881) 5841. Hindus number 2748; Muhammadans, 851; and 'others,' 2242.\n\nSardh\u00e1na.\u2014Tahsil of Meerut (Merath) District, North-Western Provinces, lying on either side of the Hindan river, and watered by the Ganges and Eastern Jumna Canals; comprising the pargan\u00e1s of Sardh\u00e1na and Barn\u00e1war. Area, 251 square miles, of which 184 square miles were cultivated. Population (1881) 159,422, namely, males 85,855, and females 73,567. Hindus number 117,803; Muhammadans, 33,770; Jains, 7267; and Christians, 582. Number of towns and villages, 123, of which 40 contain less than five hundred inhabitants; 29 from five hundred to a thousand; 51 from one to five thousand;\nand 3 upwards of five thousand inhabitants. Land revenue, \u00a330,043; total Government revenue, \u00a333,051; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a355,455. In 1883 the tahsil contained 1 criminal court, with 3 police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s); strength of regular police, 36 men; rural police or village watch (chaukidars), 276.\n\nSardh\u00e1na.\u2014Town in Meerut (Merath) District, North-Western Provinces, and former capital of the notorious Begam Samru; situated in lat. 29\u00b0 9' 6\" N., and long. 77\u00b0 39' 26\" E., on a low site near the Ganges Canal, 12 miles north-west of Meerut city. A station on the Sind, Punjab, and Delhi Railway. Population (1881) 13,313, namely, males 6858, and females 6455. Hindus number 5898; Muhammadans, 5764; Jains, 1070; and Christians, 581.\n\nThe town has a poor and decayed appearance, being in a decadent condition since the death of the Begam Samru. Northward lies Lashkarganj, founded by the Begam as a camp, and the old fort; next succeeds a wide parade-ground; and southward stands the town itself. Local tradition assigns the foundation of Sardh\u00e1na to one R\u00e1j\u00e1 Sarkat at a period anterior to the Muhammadan conquest. Its modern history is interesting from its connection with the two European adventurers Walter Reinhardt and George Thomas.\n\nThe following sketch is condensed from an account given in the official Gazetteer of Meerut. Walter Reinhardt, better known by the name of Samru or Sombre, was a butcher by profession, and a native of Luxemburg. He came to India as a soldier in the French army, and deserting that service, took employment with the British, where he attained to the rank of sergeant. Deserting again, he rejoined the French service at Chandarnagar, and on the surrender of that settlement accompanied M. Law in his wanderings throughout India from 1757 to 1760. In the latter year, Law's party joined the army of Sh\u00e1h Alam in Bengal, and remained with the emperor until his defeat in 1760 at Gay\u00e1 by Colonel Carnac, in his attempt to reconquer Bengal from the Naw\u00e1b. Samru next entered the service of M\u00edr K\u00e1sim, by whom he was employed to murder the English prisoners at Patna (PATNA DISTRICT, q.v.) in October 1763. He succeeded in escaping into Oudh, and afterwards entered the service of several native chiefs, until in 1777 he entered the service of M\u00edrza Naj\u00ed-Kh\u00e1n, the general and minister of Sh\u00e1h Alam II., and received the parsan\u00e1 of Sardh\u00e1na in fief, as an assignment for the support of his battalions. He died here in the following year, and was succeeded by his widow, the Begam Samru, who continued to maintain the military force. This remarkable woman, the illegitimate daughter of a Musalm\u00e1n of Arab descent, and the mistress of Reinhardt before becoming his wife, assumed the entire management of the estate, and the personal command of the troops, which numbered 5 battalions of\nsepoy, about 300 European officers and gunners, with 50 pieces of cannon, and a body of irregular horse.\n\nIn 1781 the Begam was baptized into the Roman Catholic Church, under the name of Johanna. Her troops rendered excellent service to the Delhi Emperor in the battle of Gokalgarh in 1788, where a charge of Sardh\u00e1na troops, personally led by the Begam and the celebrated adventurer George Thomas, saved the fortunes of the day at a critical moment. In 1792, the Begam married Levassoult, a Frenchman in command of artillery. In 1795, her European officers became disaffected, and an illegitimate son of Reinhardt, known as Zafary\u00e1b Kh\u00e1n, put himself at their head. The Begam and her husband were forced to fly. In the flight the Begam's palanquin was overtaken by the rebels, and she stabbed herself to prevent falling alive into their hands; whereupon Levassoult shot himself, in pursuance of a vow that if one of them was killed the other would commit suicide. The Begam's wound, however, was but a slight one, and she was brought back to Sardh\u00e1na. Another account is that the Begam had become tired of her husband, and that her self-inflicted wound was only a device to get rid of him. However, all her power passed temporarily into the hands of Zafary\u00e1b Kh\u00e1n, and she was treated with great personal indignity, till she was restored to power some months later by her old general George Thomas. Henceforth the Begam remained in undisturbed possession of her estates till her death in 1836.\n\nAfter the battle of Delhi, and the British conquest of the Upper Do\u00e1b in 1803, the Begam submitted to the new rulers, and ever after remained distinguished for her loyalty. Her possessions were numerous, and included several considerable towns, such as Sardh\u00e1na, Baraut, Barn\u00e1wa, and Dankaur, lying in the immediate neighbourhood of great marts like Meerut, Delhi, Kh\u00farja, and B\u00e1gp\u00e1t. Her income from her estates in Meerut District alone amounted to \u00a356,721 per annum. She kept up a considerable army, and had places of residence at Khirwa, Jal\u00e1lpur, Meerut, and Delhi, besides her palace at Sardh\u00e1na. She endowed with large sums the Catholic churches of Madras, Calcutta, Agra, and Bombay, the Sardh\u00e1na Cathedral, the Sardh\u00e1na poorhouse, St. John's Roman Catholic College, and the Meerut Catholic Chapel. She also made over a lakh of Sonat rupees to the Bishop of Calcutta for charitable purposes, and subscribed liberally to Hindu and Musalm\u00e1n institutions.\n\nZafary\u00e1b Kh\u00e1n, the son of Samru, died in 1802, and left one daughter, whom the Begam married to Mr. Dyce, an officer in her service. David Ouchterlony Dyce Sombre, the issue of this marriage, died in Paris, July 1851, and the Sardh\u00e1na estates passed to his widow, the Hon. Mary Anne Forester, daughter of Viscount St. Vincent.\n\nThe Begam's residence, on the east of the town, is a fine modern\nhouse, with a grand flight of steps at the entrance and extensive grounds. It is well furnished, and contains some good pictures. The Roman Catholic Cathedral, built in 1822, stands south of the town, and is an imposing building, surrounded by an ornamental wall. St. John's College, for training priests, occupies a low masonry house, once the Begam's private residence. Four Jain temples. Schools. Tahs\u00edl, police station, post-office. Old fort at Lashkarganj in ruins. Sardh\u00e1na is now essentially an agricultural town, with little trade and no manufactures.\n\nTwo excellent papers on the Sardh\u00e1na estate, and a biography of George Thomas, in the Calcutta Review for January and April 1880, by Mr. H. G. Keene, B.C.S., differ in some unimportant points from the history of the estate as given above.\n\nSaren\u00ed.\u2014Pargan\u00e1 in D\u00e1lmau tahsil, R\u00e1i Bareli District, Oudh; bounded on the north by Khiron, on the east by D\u00e1lmau, on the south by the Ganges, and on the west by Daundia Khera. Area, 114 square miles, or 72,968 acres, of which 41,679 acres are cultivated. Population (1881) 63,823, namely, Hindus 61,236, and Muhammadians 2587. Of the 169 villages in the pargan\u00e1, 143 are held under t\u00e1lukd\u00e1r\u00ed tenure, Bais R\u00e1jputs being the chief proprietary body; 23 villages are zamind\u00e1r\u00ed; and 3 are pattid\u00e1r\u00ed. Government land revenue, \u00a38924.\n\nSarg\u00faja.\u2014The largest of the Native States of Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur, Bengal; lies between 22\u00b0 37' 30\" and 24\u00b0 6' 30\" N. lat., and between 82\u00b0 32' 5\" and 84\u00b0 7' E. long. Area, 6055 square miles. Population (1881) 270,311 souls. Bounded on the north by M\u00edrz\u00e1pur, a District of the North-Western Provinces, and the State of Rew\u00e1; on the east by Loh\u00e1rdag\u00e1 District; on the south by Jashpur and Udaipur States, and the District of Bil\u00e1spur in the Central Provinces; and on the west by Kore\u00e1 State.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014Sarg\u00faja may be described in general terms as a secluded basin, walled in on the north-east and south by massive hill-barriers, and protected from approach on the west by the forest-clad tract of Kore\u00e1. The eastern portion of the State consists of an undulating table-land about 2500 feet above the sea, continuous with, but slightly higher than, the adjoining plateau of Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur proper. From this, again, isolated hill ranges, and p\u00e1ts or plateaux, capped with a horizontal stratum of trap rock, rise to an elevation of 3500 and 4000 feet, forming on the north the boundary of Pal\u00e1mau, and blending in the south with the northern Jashpur Hills. The two most prominent physical features of Sarg\u00faja are the M\u00e1inp\u00e1t, a magnificent table-land 18 miles long, from 6 to 8 miles broad, and 3781 feet above sea-level; and the Jam\u00edr\u00e1p\u00e1t, a long winding ridge about 2 miles wide. The M\u00e1inp\u00e1t is well wooded and watered throughout, and supplies extensive grazing fields during the summer months; the pasturage dues\nof this tract alone are estimated at \u00a3250 per annum. The chief peaks in the State are Mail\u00e1n, 4024 feet; J\u00e1m, 3827; and Partagharsa, 3804. The principal rivers are the Kanhar, Rehr, and M\u00e1h\u00e1n, which flow northwards into the Son (Soane); and the Sankh, a tributary of the Br\u00e1hman\u00ed. None of these streams is navigable. Coal is found in Central Sarg\u00faja, in the Bisr\u00e1mpur field. There is a group of hot springs at Tat\u00e1pani, in the north of the State; their maximum temperature is 184\u00b0 F. S\u00e1l timber abounds everywhere.\n\nHistory.\u2014The early history of Sarg\u00faja is extremely obscure. Authentic records date from 1758, when a Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 army in progress to the Ganges overran the State, and compelled its chief to acknowledge himself a tributary of the Berar Government. In consequence of the chief having aided a rebellion in Pal\u00e1mau against the British at the end of the last century, an expedition entered Sarg\u00faja under the command of Colonel Jones. Order was restored, and a treaty was concluded between the British Government and the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 of Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur, which, however, proved inoperative. As soon as the British force retired, fresh disputes broke out between the ruling chief and his relations; and in 1813, Major Roughsedge, the Political Agent, went to Sarg\u00faja and endeavoured to settle the affairs of the State. The young R\u00e1j\u00e1 being imbecile, a diw\u00e1n was appointed to carry on the government; but this officer was soon afterwards killed, and an attempt to seize the R\u00e1j\u00e1 and his two R\u00e1n\u00eds was only frustrated by the gallantry of a small guard of British Sepoys who had been left in Sarg\u00faja for their protection. Until 1818, the State continued to be the scene of constant lawlessness; but in that year it was ceded to the British Government under a provisional agreement concluded with Madhuj\u00ed Bhonsla (Ap\u00e1 S\u00e1hib), and order was soon restored. In 1826 the chief received the title of Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1. The present chief, Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 Raghu\u0144\u00e1th Saran Singh, attained his majority in July 1882, the State having previously been under the direct management of the Commissioner of Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur.\n\nPopulation in 1881 numbered 270,311, on an area of 6055 square miles, inhabiting 1286 villages and 51,122 houses. Males numbered 137,389, and females 132,922. Average density of population, 44\u00b764 persons per square mile; villages per square mile, 0\u00b721; persons per village, 210; houses per square mile, 8\u00b744; persons per house, 5\u00b729. Classified according to religion, Hindus numbered 268,027, and Muhammadans 2284. The bulk of the population are of aboriginal descent, but the Census of 1881 does not give any ethnical classification. In 1872, however, the Dravidian aborigines, consisting principally of Gonds and Ur\u00e1ons, were returned as forming 40\u00b71 per cent., and the Kolarian tribes 21\u00b75 per cent., of the total population. The residence of the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 is at Bisr\u00e1mpur; but Pratappur is\nvirtually the capital of the State. It contains a court-house, jail, and school. Only two villages in Sarg\u00faja have a population of from 1000 to 2000 souls. The chief objects of interest are Ramgarh Hill, the remains of several temples, the deserted fortress of J\u00fab\u00e1, and numerous images. [For a full account of these antiquities and of the aboriginal tribes of Sarg\u00faja, see Statistical Account of Bengal, vol. xvii. pp. 231\u2013240.]\n\nAgriculture, etc. \u2014 The staple crops are cereals, oil-seeds, and cotton. On an average, rents vary from 1s. 1\u00bdd. to 1s. 6d. per acre. Cesses, however, are levied, which equal, and sometimes exceed, the actual rent; and every cultivator is bound to work for his landlord fifteen days in the year, exclusive of the time spent in going to his work. This system of forced labour is at present the chief drawback to cultivation in Sarg\u00faja. The passes into the State are impracticable for wheeled traffic. The manufactures are pottery, coarse cloth, and rough ironwork. Weekly markets are held at Prat\u00e1ppur, Bisr\u00e1mpur, and Jhilm\u00edli. Exports \u2014 food-grains, oil-seeds, ghi, lac, resin, and cocoons of tasar silk; imports \u2014 brass and pewter vessels, ornaments, piece-goods, and salt.\n\nAdministration. \u2014 The finances of the State have much improved while under direct administration; and in 1881, the year before the Mahar\u00e1j\u00e1 attained his majority, the revenue amounted to \u00a34094, and the expenditure (including a tribute of \u00a3264) to \u00a32109. Police duties are performed by the feudal sub-proprietors, styled n\u00e1kad\u00e1rs, each being responsible for the public peace within his borders. Sarg\u00faja is divided into 11 police circles, three of which are kept up by the State.\n\nSarg\u00far.\u2014Town in Mysore District, Mysore State.\u2014See Saragur.\n\nSarh S\u00e1limpur (or Narwal).\u2014Easternmost tahsil of Cawnpur District, North-Western Provinces; consisting of a fertile plain, lying along the south bank of the Ganges, and traversed by the East Indian Railway.

On the division of his estates by Pah\u00e1r Singh, son of Jagatr\u00e1j, R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Jaitpur, M\u00e1n Singh, his second son, obtained Sarila. His successor, Tej Singh, was expelled by Al\u00ed Bah\u00e1dur, but eventually recovered a portion of his territories through the assistance of Himmat Bah\u00e1dur. At the time of the British occupation of Bundelkhand, he was found in possession of the fort and village of Sarila. In consideration of his voluntary submission and influence in the District, he was granted 11 villages by sanad in 1807. The military force of the State consists of 4 guns, 40 cavalry, and 200 infantry and police.\n\n**Sarishpur** (or Siddheswar).\u2014Hill range in the south of Assam, forming the boundary between Cachar District on the east and Sylhet on the west.\u2014See SARASPUR.\n\n**Sarjapur**.\u2014Municipal village in Bangalore District, Mysore State.

The remains form a mound of brick and stone d\u00e9bris about half a mile long by a quarter of a mile broad, out of which still emerge the remains of two great stupas, and a third is in the vicinity. The most remarkable, specially known as the Dhamek, is a solid dome 93 feet in diameter, and 110 feet above the\nplain. The plinth, 43 feet high, is of solid stone cramped with iron, and richly sculptured on the exterior. The upper part consists of dilapidated brickwork. The second stupa was excavated for bricks in 1794. The third, now called Chaukandi, is 800 yards south of Dhamek, and consists of a lofty ruined mound of brickwork, 74 feet in height, crowned by an octagonal building, commemorating the Emperor Humayun's visit in 1531. The remains of many other buildings have been excavated in the vicinity. The Dhamek tower probably stands on the site of, if it be not identical with, that erected by Asoka to mark the spot where Buddha first preached his doctrine. The name is a corrupt form of Dharma, 'The Law.' Both Dhamek and Chaukandi stupas appear to be mentioned by Hiuen Tsiang. See General Cunningham's Anc. Geog.

The country was originally occupied by Thatheras, who were driven out of many of their villages by Gaur Rajputs in the middle of the 12th century; and their total expulsion by the Sombansis occurred shortly afterwards. The pargan\u00e1 was first constituted in 1803 by Raj\u00e1 Bhaw\u00e1n\u00ed Parshad of Muhamdi, out of villages previously belonging to the neighbouring pargan\u00e1s of Pali and Sar\u00e1.\n\nSaromannagar.\u2014Town in Hardoi District, and head-quarters of Saromannagar pargan\u00e1; situated 6 miles south of Shahabad, and 15 miles north-west of Hardoi town.

Population (1881) 131,754, namely, males 65,395, and females 66,359, occupying 27,868 houses in 150 villages. Hindus number 129,018; Muhammadans, 2709; Christians, 19; and \u2018others,\u2019 8. The t\u00e1luk in olden times formed a zamind\u00e1ri, which was purchased by Government for \u00a375 in 1831. It is near the coast, and contains some of the best wet crop land in Vizagapatam District; but it is liable to sudden and injurious rains. In 1883 the t\u00e1luk contained\u2014criminal courts, 2; police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), 6; regular police, 54 men. Land revenue, \u00a314,375.

Its irrigation tank is one of the finest in the District, and is filled from the Penner (Ponnaiy\u00e1r) anicut.\n\nSarw\u00e1n.\u2014Village in Unao District, Oudh; situated in lat. 26\u00b0 36' N., and long. 80\u00b0 56' E., 6 miles north-east of Purw\u00e1, and 26 miles east\nof Unao town. Population (1881) 2014, namely, Hindus 1913, and Musalm\u00e1ns 101. A very ancient village, with a noted Sivaite temple. Concerning this temple, Mr. C. A. Elliott narrates the following tradition in his Chronicles of Unao, pp. 5, 6:\u2014'To worship at this temple, and to shoot and hunt in the wild forest country around, came R\u00e1j\u00e1 Dasaratha from Ajodhya, the father of R\u00e1mchandra, the 57th R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Ajodhya. He was encamped at Sarw\u00e1ra on the edge of a tank. By night came Sarw\u00e1n, a holy Rishi from Chaunsa (near Ajodhya), by caste a Baniy\u00e1. He was going on pilgrimage, and was carrying his blind father and mother in a pair of baskets, slung over his shoulders. Reaching the tank, he put his burden down and stopped to drink. R\u00e1j\u00e1 Dasaratha heard a rustling noise, and thinking it was some wild beast, took up his bow and shot an arrow, which struck Sarw\u00e1n, and he died. Then his blind parents in their misery lifted up their voices and cursed the man who had done the thing. They prayed that as he had slain the son who was the light of their hearts, so he might have trouble and sorrow from his own children, and might die of grief even as they were dying. Having so said, they gave up the ghost; and from that day to this no Kshattriya has lived in the town which is founded on the spot, and is called Sarw\u00e1n. Many have tried it, but evil has overtaken them in one way or another. The tank remains to this day, and by it lies under a tree the body of Sarw\u00e1n, a figure of stone; and as he died with his thirst unquenched, so if water is poured into the navel of the figure, the hole can never be filled up, but is inexhaustible in its demand.'\n\nSarw\u00e1r.\u2014Town in Kishangarh State, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na; situated about 25 miles south-east of Nasir\u00e1b\u00e1d. Population (1881) 5361, namely, Hindus, 4107; Muhammadans, 785; and 'others,' 469.\n\nSarya.\u2014Indigo factory in Muzaffarpur District, Bengal; situated 18 miles south-west of Muzaffarpur town, on the banks of the Bay\u00e1 river, which is here crossed by the Chapr\u00e1 road on a fine three-arched bridge. A short distance from Sary\u00e1 is a monolith called Bh\u00edm Singh's l\u00e1tth\u00ed or club, supporting a lion carved in stone. It consists of a plain cylinder about 24 feet high, on the top of which is a pedestal with the lion. The cylinder is in one piece, the height of the whole being about 30 feet. Its depth below ground is unknown, but it must be very great, as some persons once dug down several feet, and failed to reach the foundation. The stone is covered with names, many of them English, some of which date from 1793. It stands in the courtyard of a Br\u00e1hman's house, but no religious meetings take place here. Close at hand is a well or deep excavation; and the Br\u00e1hman who owns the land on which the monolith stands affirms that a large amount of treasure is believed to lie concealed beneath, and that this excavation was made to try and recover it. The indigo factory and attached lands\ncultivate about 4600 bigh\u00e1s, giving an average annual out-turn of about 530 maunds of dye.\n\n**S\u00e1sni (S\u00e1sani).**\u2014Town in Al\u00edgarh District, North-Western Provinces. Lat. 27\u00b0 42' 12\" N., long. 78\u00b0 8' 5\" E. Distant from Al\u00edgarh town 14 miles south on the Agra road, from H\u00e1thras 7 miles north. Population (1881) 4851.

Average density, 348 persons per square mile; villages per square mile, 1.33; persons per village, 261; houses per square mile, 57; persons per house, 6.7. This Sub-division consists of the 4 police circles of S\u00e1sser\u00e1m, Khargarh, Dhang\u00e1in, and Dehri. In 1870\u201371 it contained 1 civil and 2 criminal courts, a regular police force of 141, and a village watch of 1713 men.\n\n**S\u00e1sser\u00e1m.**\u2014Chief town of S\u00e1sser\u00e1m Sub-division, Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Bengal; situated on the Grand Trunk Road, 61 miles south of Arrah, in lat. 24\u00b0 56' 59\" N., and long. 84\u00b0 3' 7\" E. Population of S\u00e1sser\u00e1m village (1881) 2531; of the municipality, 22,000. Municipal income (1883\u201384), \u00a31499, of which \u00a3761 was derived from taxation; average incidence of taxation, 8\u00bdd. per head. The name S\u00e1sser\u00e1m or Sahsr\u00e1m signifies one thousand toys, because a certain Asur or infidel who lived here had a thousand arms, each holding a separate plaything. The town, now fast declining in importance, is noted as containing the tomb of the Afgh\u00e1n Sher Sh\u00e1h, who conquered Hum\u00e1y\u00fan, and subsequently became Emperor of Delhi. His mausoleum is at the west end of the town, within a large tank, the excavated earth of which has been thrown into unshapely banks some distance off. The tomb itself consists of an octagonal hall surrounded by an arcade, which forms a gallery; the roof is supported by four Gothic arches; the ornaments are in the very worst taste. It is now being repaired at Government expense. (For full details respecting this monument, see Statistical Account of Bengal, vol. xii. pp. 205\u2013208). The remarkable mosque of Chandan Shahid is situated on a lofty hill east of the town.\n\n**Sasu.**\u2014River in the south of Lakhimpur District, Assam.\u2014See Sesa.\n\nVOL. XII.\nS\u00e1swar (Sasar).\u2014Chief town of the Purandhar Sub-division of Poona (P\u00fana) District, Bombay Presidency; situated on the left bank of the river K\u00e1rha 16 miles south-east of Poona city, in lat. 18\u00b0 20' 20\" N., and long. 74\u00b0 4' 20\" E. Population within municipal limits (1881) 5684, namely, Hindus, 5411; Muhammadans, 249; and Jains, 24. S\u00e1swar was the original Deccan home of the Peshw\u00e1's family. Beyond the town, across the river K\u00e1rha, stands the palace of the old Peshw\u00e1, now used for the Collector's office. Near the junction of the K\u00e1rha and one of its minor tributaries is a walled building, the palace of the great Br\u00e1hman family Purandhare of Purandhar, whose fortunes for upwards of a century were closely connected with those of the Peshw\u00e1s. This latter palace was formerly strongly fortified, and in 1818 was garrisoned and held out for ten days against a detachment of British troops. About 1840 the M\u00edrs of Sind were confined in S\u00e1swar. Municipal income (1883-84), \u00a3336; incidence of taxation, 1s. 1\u00bdd. per head. Dispensary, post-office, and two schools.\n\nSata.\u2014Channel of the Indus in Sind, Bombay Presidency. The most important eastern branch of the river, that to the west being known as the Baghar. The Sata sends off, on the left or eastern side, two branches, the Mal and the Manti, both of which are now only shallow streams. Before the great earthquake that occurred in Cutch (Kachchh) in 1819, vessels from seaward entered the Richal mouth, the only accessible entrance, and passed into the Haj\u00e1mro through what was then the Khedew\u00e1ri creek, and thence into the Mal to Sh\u00e1hbandar, an important naval station under the Kalhora princes. This passage was closed by the earthquake, and a new mouth opened, viz. the Kukaiw\u00e1ri, which in 1867 was found to be completely choked by sand. The Khedew\u00e1ri was described by Lieutenant Carless in 1837 as having a depth of from 16 to 18 feet, but since 1845 the Haj\u00e1mro had taken its place as the main channel.\n\nS\u00e1t\u00e1na (or B\u00e1glan).\u2014Sub-division of N\u00e1sik District, Bombay Presidency. Area, 619 square miles. Population (1881) 64,875, namely, males 32,885, and females 31,990, occupying 9992 houses in 155 villages. Hindus number 48,972; Muhammadans, 1678; and 'others,' 14,225. The chief river is the Mosam. The route from the Deccan through S\u00e1t\u00e1na to the Gujar\u00e1t coast has been a line of traffic from remote times. Akbar, when he conquered Kh\u00e1ndesh in 1599, attempted to capture S\u00e1t\u00e1na, and besieged the chief Prat\u00e1psh\u00e1h for seven years unsuccessfully, and was in the end obliged to compound with him. In 1637, S\u00e1t\u00e1na was attacked by Aurangzeb. The chief submitted and was made commander of 3000 horse. S\u00e1t\u00e1na formed part of Kh\u00e1ndesh District till 1869, when it was transferred to N\u00e1sik. In 1875, S\u00e1t\u00e1na, with its two petty divisions of Jaikhedan and Abhona, was divided into two Sub-divisions, S\u00e1t\u00e1na (or B\u00e1glan) and\nKalwan. In 1880-81, 6658 holdings or khalas were recorded, with an average area of 26\u00bd acres, paying an average assessment of \u00a32, 2s. 6d. The area under cultivation in 1880 was 145,763 acres. Cereals and millets occupied 106,578 acres; pulses, 22,882; oil-seeds, 15,475; fibres, 500; and miscellaneous crops, 1756 acres. In 1883 the Sub-division contained 1 civil and 2 criminal courts; police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), 2; regular police, 63 men; village watch (chaukid\u00e1rs), 306.\n\nS\u00e1t\u00e1na.\u2014Town in S\u00e1t\u00e1na or B\u00e1glan Sub-division, N\u00e1sik District, Bombay Presidency; situated about 30 miles west of M\u00e1leg\u00e1on.

Area, 67 square miles. Population (1881) 411. Estimated revenue, \u00a395, of which \u00a310, os. 6d. is paid as tribute to the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda, and 12s. to the Naw\u00e1b of Jun\u00e1gahr.\n\nSatanw\u00e1ri.\u2014Fort in Bhop\u00e1l State, Central India Agency; situated in lat. 23\u00b0 36' N., and long. 77\u00b0 10' E., 30 miles north-west of Bhop\u00e1l town, close to the Gwalior frontier. Satanw\u00e1ri appears, says Thornton, to have been granted with other possessions in 1818 by the British Government to the Naw\u00e1b of Bhop\u00e1l, 'in order to mark its approbation of his conduct, and to enable him to maintain the stipulated contingent.'\n\nS\u00e1t\u00e1ra.\u2014British District in the Deccan or Central Division of the Bombay Presidency, lying between 16\u00b0 51' and 18\u00b0 10' 39\" N. lat., and between 73\u00b0 37' and 74\u00b0 58' E. long. Area, 4988 square miles. Population (1881) 1,062,350 souls. It is bounded on the north by the States of Bhor and Phaltan, and the N\u00edra river separating it from Poona; on the east by Shol\u00e1pur District and the estates of the Panth Pratinidhi and the chief of J\u00e1t; on the south by the river V\u00e1rna, separating it from Kolh\u00e1pur and S\u00e1ngli States, and by a few villages of Belg\u00e1um District; and on the west by the Sahy\u00e1dri range of hills, separating it from the Konkan or southern Districts of Kol\u00e1ba and Ratn\u00e1giri. The administrative head-quarters are at SATARA TOWN.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014From Mah\u00e1baleshwar in the north-west corner of the District, 4717 feet above the sea, start two hill ranges of equal height and nearly at right angles to each other\u2014one the main range of the Sahy\u00e1dr\u00eds, running towards the south and forming the western boundary of the District; and the other the Mah\u00e1deo range of hills, which, going first in an easterly and then in a south-easterly direction, extends towards the eastern boundary, where it sinks gradually into the plain. These hills throw out numerous spurs over the District, forming the valleys of the several streams which make up the head-waters of the Kistna, one of the largest rivers in Western India. Except near Mah\u00e1baleshwar, and in the valley of the Koina, the hills of the\nDistrict are very low, and have a strikingly bare and rugged aspect. The Mah\u00e1deo range, even in the rainy season, is but scantily covered with verdure. The hills are bold and abrupt, presenting in many cases bare scarps of black rock, and looking at a distance like so many hill fortresses. They consist of trap, intersected by strata of basalt and topped with laterite.\n\nOf the different soils on the plains, the commonest is the black loamy clay containing carbonate of lime. This is very fertile, and when well watered is capable of yielding heavy crops. Red clay is found near the foot of the hills. Besides many soils of a light and dark brown colour, white nodules of pure lime, and also light brown loam with a large proportion of lime, are often met with in the east.\n\nThe water-supply, especially in the west, is tolerably plentiful; but in the east, during the hot weather, there is great scarcity. The supply comes partly from rivers and partly from numerous ponds and wells. Almost all the rivers rising near Mah\u00e1baleshwar on the Sahy\u00e1dri range, or in the Mah\u00e1deo Hills, flow directly or indirectly into the Kistna. Except a small area in the north and north-east that drains into the Bh\u00edma, the District of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra is the head valley of the Kistna river. Down the centre, with a general slope to the south and south-west, along a valley which slowly opens into a plain, the Kistna flows first to the south and then to the east, passing across the whole District from its north-west to its south-east corner. From the central plain of the Kistna eight valleys branch to the hills. Some of the streams of these valleys hold water only for a short time after the rains; but by throwing temporary dams across them and leading their water into canals, they are much utilized for irrigation. During the hot season, most of the ponds and wells become dry.\n\nThe city of SATARA receives its supply through pipes from a reservoir on the Enteshwar Hill, built by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Prat\u00e1p Singh. Scarcity of water is, however, felt in the city during the hot season, and steps are being taken to increase the supply by improving some of the reservoirs. Irrigation works have been constructed on the Kistna near K\u00e1rad, on the Yerla at Khatg\u00e1on, on the Nira near M\u00e1lshiras, on the M\u00e1n, on the V\u00e1sna, on the V\u00e1ng, and on the N\u00e1ndni.\n\nThe whole of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra falls within the Deccan trap area. As in other parts of the West Deccan, the hills are layers of soft or amygdaloid trap, separated by flows of hard basalt and capped by laterite or iron clay.\n\nIron and copper ore, found in abundance on the Mah\u00e1baleshwar and Mah\u00e1deo Hills, were formerly worked by the Musalm\u00e1n tribe of Dh\u00e1vd\u00e1s. Owing, however, to the fall in the value of iron and the rise in the price of fuel, smelting is now no longer carried on.\n\nForests cover an area of 662 square miles, or 13\u00b73 per cent. of the total area. Almost the whole of the District is hilly. The forests\nare scattered over the District, and are much broken by private and cultivated land. In the west, the belt of evergreen forest along the line of the Sahy\u00e1dr\u00eds is divided into six forest ranges. These six ranges are fairly compact, with little cultivated land between. The seven eastern forest ranges are bare hills, with here and there a little scrub and teak. The forests of the western Sub-divisions have a large store of timber and firewood. J\u00e1mbul (Eugenia jambolana), gela (Vangueria spinosa), and pesha (Cylicodaphne wightiana) grow on the main ridge of the Sahy\u00e1dr\u00eds, and small teak on the eastern slopes. Sandal-wood is occasionally found, and the mango, jack, and guava are often grown for their fruit. Patches of bamboo sometimes occur. The cinchona plantation, established in Lingmala near Mah\u00e1baleshwar, has proved a failure.\n\nOf wild animals, tigers, bears, hy\u00e6nas, bison, wild boar, and s\u00e1mbhar deer are found only in the western hills, and hares and jackals throughout the District. The once famous breed of horses in the Nira valley has degenerated, and Government efforts to improve it have so far met with little success.\n\nHistory.\u2014It seems probable that, as in the rest of the Bombay Deccan and Konkan, the Andhrabhritya or Sh\u00e1takarni kings (B.C. 90\u2014A.D. 300), and probably their Kolh\u00e1pur branch, held S\u00e1t\u00e1ra till the third or fourth century after Christ. For the 900 years ending early in the fourteenth century with the Muhammadan overthrow of the Deogiri J\u00e1dhavs, no historical information regarding S\u00e1t\u00e1ra is available; and the Deon\u00e1gari and K\u00e1narese inscriptions which have been found on old temples have not yet (1885) been translated. Still, as inscribed stones and copperplates have been found in the neighbouring Districts of Ratn\u00e1giri and Belg\u00e1um and the State of Kolh\u00e1pur, it is probable that the Early and Western Ch\u00e1lukyas held S\u00e1t\u00e1ra District from about 550 to 760; the R\u00e1shtr\u00e1kutas to 973; the Western Ch\u00e1lukyas, and under them the Kolh\u00e1pur Sil\u00e1har\u00e1s, to 1220; and the Deogiri J\u00e1dhavs till the Muhammadan conquest of the Deccan about 1300.\n\nThe first Muhammadan invasion took place in 1294, and the J\u00e1dhav dynasty was overthrown in 1318. The Muhammadan power was then fairly established, and in 1345 the Bahmani dynasty rose to power. On the fall of the Bahman\u00eds towards the end of the 15th century, each chief set up for himself; the Bij\u00e1pur kings finally asserted themselves; and under the Bij\u00e1pur kings the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s arose. S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, with the adjacent Districts of Poona and Shol\u00e1pur, formed the centre of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 power. The history of that power belongs to the general annals of India. Its founder, Sivaji, commenced his career as a free-lance about the year 1644; and during the remainder of the century, his family rapidly aggrandized itself at the expense both of the Bij\u00e1pur King and of the Delhi Emperor.\nThe general decay of the Mughal Empire from 1700 to 1750 opened the way for the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 supremacy. The Peshw\u00e1s, or Mayors of the Palace, date their power from Balaj\u00ed, about 1718. In 1749, the sovereignty passed from the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra R\u00e1j\u00e1s to the Br\u00e1hman Peshw\u00e1s, with their head-quarters in the adjoining District of Poona. The descendants of Sivaj\u00ed became little more than pensioned prisoners, but they clung to the title of R\u00e1j\u00e1 of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. The battle of P\u00e1nipat in 1761 broke the power of the great Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 confederacy. But the Peshw\u00e1s still remained the most important native rulers in India till the rise of Haidar Ali.\n\nRepeated wars with the English ended in the final defeat of the Peshwa\u2019s army at Ashti in 1818. His territory was thereupon annexed; but the English, with a politic generosity, freed the titular Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 R\u00e1j\u00e1 (the descendant of Sivaji) from the Peshwa\u2019s control, and assigned to him the principality of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. Captain Grant Duff was appointed his tutor until he should gain some experience in rule. In April 1822, the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra territory was formally handed over to the R\u00e1j\u00e1, and thenceforward was managed by him entirely. After a time, he became impatient of the control exercised by the British Government; and as he persisted in intriguing and holding communications with other princes, in contravention of his treaty, he was deposed in 1839, and sent as a State prisoner to Benares, and his brother Sh\u00e1hj\u00ed was placed on the throne. This prince, who did much for the improvement of his people, died in 1848 without male heirs; and after long deliberation, it was decided that the State should be resumed by the British Government. Liberal pensions were granted to the R\u00e1j\u00e1\u2019s three widows, and they were allowed to live in the palace at S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. The survivor of these ladies died in 1874.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The Census returns of 1872 showed a total population of 1,116,050; that of 1881 a total of 1,062,350, residing in 14 towns and 1329 villages, and in 151,173 houses; unoccupied houses numbered 23,233. Area, 4988 square miles. Average density of population, 212'98 persons per square mile; villages per square mile, 0'27; houses per square mile, 34'9; persons per village, 791'03; and persons per house, 7'02. Classified according to sex, there were 532,525 males and 529,825 females; proportion of males, 50'1 per cent. Classified according to age, there were\u2014under 15 years, boys 220,901, and girls 199,697; total children, 420,598, or 39'6 per cent.: 15 years and upwards, males 311,624, and females 330,128; total adults, 641,752, or 60'4 per cent. of the population. Classified according to religion, Hindus numbered 1,008,918; Muhammadans, 36,712; Jains, 15,679; P\u00e1rsis, 99; Christians, 886; Jews, 21; Sikhs, 29; and Buddhists, 6.\n\nThe Hindus were divided into the following main castes and social distinctions:\u2014Br\u00e1hmans (priestly caste), 48,362; R\u00e1jputs (warrior caste),\n1328; Cham\u00e1rs, 16,105; Darj\u00eds (tailors), 9664; Dhangars, 41,547; Dhob\u00eds (washermen), 7640; N\u00e1pits (barbers), 14,251; Jangams, 3796; Kunb\u00eds (cultivators), 583,569; Kol\u00eds (cultivators), 4198; Kumbh\u00e1rs (potters), 12,321; Kosht\u00eds, 8632; Ling\u00e1yats (traders), 17,035; Loh\u00e1rs (blacksmiths), 5193; M\u00e1l\u00eds (gardeners), 24,784; M\u00e1ngs (depressed caste), 20,919; Mh\u00e1rs (depressed caste), 87,679; Son\u00e1rs (goldsmiths), 8231; Sut\u00e1rs (carpenters), 11,043; Tel\u00eds (oilmen), 9499; Banj\u00e1r\u00e1s, 2046; and \u2018others,\u2019 71,076. The Muhammadan population consisted of\u2014Path\u00e1n\u00eds, 3780; Sayyids, 4235; Shaikhs, 27,979; and \u2018others,\u2019 718. According to sect,\u2014Sunnis, 36,109; Shi\u00e1s, 546; and \u2018others,\u2019 57. The Christian population of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra District included\u2014Europeans, 407; Eurasians, 19; and natives, 460. Adopting another system of classification, there were\u2014Roman Catholics, 387; followers of the Church of England, 317; and followers of other Christian creeds, 182.\n\nOf the Hindus, who form the great majority of the population, more than a half consist of Kunb\u00eds, who during the period of Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 ascendency (1674\u20131817) furnished the bulk of the armies. The M\u00e1vl\u00e1s, Sivaji\u2019s best soldiers, were drawn from the gh\u00e1tm\u00e1tha (hill-top) portion of the District. During the last half-century they have become quiet and orderly, living almost entirely by agriculture. Dark-skinned and, as a rule, small, they are active and capable of enduring much fatigue. Br\u00e1hmans, employed as priests or Government servants, are found in large numbers in the towns of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and W\u00e1i. Besides these, V\u00e1n\u00ed, Dhangars, R\u00e1mosis, Mh\u00e1rs, and M\u00e1ngs are among the principal castes met with throughout the District.\n\nWith reference to occupation, the Census of 1881 divided the male population into the following six main groups:\u2014(1) Professional class, including State officials of every kind, and members of the learned professions, 18,118; (2) domestic servants, inn and lodging-house keepers, 4872; (3) commercial class, including bankers, merchants, and carriers, 4086; (4) agricultural and pastoral class, including gardeners, 241,526; (5) industrial class, including all manufacturers and artisans, 46,257; and (6) indefinite and non-productive classes, comprising general labourers, male children, and persons of unspecified occupation, 217,666.\n\nOf the 1343 towns and villages in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra in 1881, 289 contained less than two hundred inhabitants; 410 from two to five hundred; 331 from five hundred to one thousand; 224 from one to two thousand; 49 from two to three thousand; 28 from three to five thousand; 8 from five to ten thousand; 3 from ten to fifteen thousand; and 1 from twenty to fifty thousand. Municipal towns\u2014S\u00e1t\u00e1ra (1881), 28,601; W\u00e1i, 11,676; Kar\u00e1d, 10,778; T\u00e1sg\u00e1on, 10,206; Ashta, 9548; Isl\u00e1mpur, 8949; Rahimatpur, 6082; Mhaswad, 5581; Vita, 4477; Malcolmpt, 3248; Mayni, 2997; Pusesavli, 2569; Shingn\u00e1pur, 1167.\nAgriculture.\u2014Agriculture, the main occupation of the people, supported in 1881, 744,013 persons, or 70 per cent. of the population; 374,576 only were agricultural workers. Of the total area of the District (5378 square miles), 3385 square miles are cultivated, of which 73 square miles are non-revenue-paying. Total amount of Government assessment, including local rates and cesses on land, \u00a3166,323; average incidence of assessment, including local rates and cesses, 1s. 4\u00bdd. The average area of cultivable and uncultivated land per agricultural worker is 5'9 acres.\n\nThe bulk of the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra landholders are Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 Kunb\u00eds. But the best class of husbandmen are the Jains of the south and south-west of the District. In the east of the District, the landholders are said to be only moderately hard-working; and the richer soils in the west are said to suffer from being cropped several years in succession without fallow. At the same time, certain parts of the District show notable instances of skill and enterprise. S\u00e1t\u00e1ra suffered from the famine of 1876-78; and the indebtedness of the people to the money-lenders has demanded special steps to be taken to preserve their position as peasant proprietors, by the introduction of the Deccan Agriculturists Relief Act. The soils of the District belong to three main classes, red in the hills, and black and light coloured in the plains. The black soil, especially along the valley of the Kistna and its tributaries, is very fertile, yielding two crops a year.\n\nAccording to the Revenue Survey, of the total area of Government land (2,442,503 acres), 1,802,156 acres, or 73'8 per cent., are cultivable; 141,291 acres are uncultivable; 4956 acres are under grass; and 387,715 acres are forest. Of the whole cultivable area, 1,378,659 acres were held for tillage in 1882-83, namely, 43,462 acres garden land, 14,895 acres rice land, and 1,320,302 acres under dry crops. In 1882-83 the number of holdings was 120,158, with an average area of 14\u00bd acres.\n\nJo\u00e1r (Sorghum vulgare) and b\u00e1jra (Penicillaria spicata), the staple food of the people, occupy nearly half the cultivated area. Rice-fields are found only in the west, along river banks. In the south and east, cotton is grown, most of it of a local variety, but some brought from Hingangh\u00e1t. Near Mah\u00e1baleshwar, several European vegetables, especially potatoes, grow freely, and to a great extent supply the Bombay market. In some of the hill villages, which have a heavy rainfall, nachni (Eleusine corocana) and vari (Panicum miliare) are raised on the kumari system, that is, by cutting down and burning brushwood and sowing the seeds in the ashes. This practice, formerly general, has, on account of the damage it does to the forests, been to a large extent prohibited.\n\nIn 1882-83, 1,113,911 acres were under cultivation, of which 39,757 were twice cropped. Grain crops, consisting chiefly of jo\u00e1r and b\u00e1jra,\noccupied 898,206 acres; pulses, 159,211 acres; oil-seeds, 42,001 acres; fibres, 22,581 acres, of which 19,015 were under cotton; orchards, 3952 acres; drugs and narcotics, 8035 acres, of which 7523 acres were under tobacco; and miscellaneous crops, 19,682 acres.\n\nIn 1882-83, the prices of produce per maund of 80 lbs. were\u2014wheat, 6s. 8\u00bdd.; rice (common), 7s. 4d.; bajra, 3s. 8\u00bdd.; jo\u00e1r, 3s. 4\u00bdd.; d\u00e1l, 5s. 3d.; salt, 6s. 5d.; flour, 7s. 6\u00bcd.; ghi, \u00a33, 1s. 9\u00bed. The wages per diem of a skilled labourer were 6d. to 2s.; of an unskilled labourer, 1\u00bdd. to 9d.; the hire per diem of cart, 1s. to 1s. 6d.; of bullocks, 6d. to 1s.\n\nIn 1882-83, the agricultural stock consisted of\u2014bullocks, 243,424; cows, 141,139; buffaloes, 110,479; horses, 12,797; sheep and goats, 396,994; ploughs, 48,981; carts, 17,387.\n\nIrrigation.\u2014In 1883, S\u00e1t\u00e1ra District had six large irrigation works. These are the Rev\u00e1ri canal on the V\u00e1sna, the Yerla canal, the Gondoli canal on the M\u00e1n, the M\u00e1yni reservoir on the V\u00e1ng, the Chikhli canal on the N\u00e1ndni, and the Kistna canal. The Rev\u00e1ri canal is an old work restored, while the other five are new works. The Kistna canal, which has its source in the Sahy\u00e1dri hills, has an unfailing supply of water, while the others depend on the local rainfall. The total irrigable area is 47,145 acres; in 1882-83, 5550 acres were watered. Besides these works, the Mhaswad lake is being built as a separate irrigation work on the lower M\u00e1n. In an average year the water-supply from this lake would suffice for an area of 30,000 acres. The work may be said to protect an area of 90,000 acres, one-third of which may be watered every year. The country under command of this canal stands in great need of water, as its rainfall is very uncertain.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014The uncertain and scanty rainfall makes eastern S\u00e1t\u00e1ra one of the parts of the Bombay Presidency most liable to suffer from failure of crops. The earliest recorded is the famous famine known as Durg\u00e1 Dev\u00ed, which, beginning in 1396, is said to have lasted twelve years, and to have spread over all India south of the Narbad\u00e1 river. Whole Districts were emptied of their people; and for upwards of thirty years, a very scanty revenue was obtained from the territory between the God\u00e1vari and the Kistna rivers. In 1520, mainly owing to military disturbances, the crops in the Deccan were destroyed, and a famine followed. In 1629-30, severe famine raged throughout the Deccan. The rains failed for two years, causing a great loss of life. According to local tradition, the famine of 1791-92 was the severest ever known. It seems to have come after a series of bad years, when the evils of scanty rainfall were aggravated by disturbances and war. The native governments granted large remissions of revenue, the export of grain was forbidden, and a sale price was fixed. Rice was brought from Bengal to Bombay.\n\nThe famine of 1802-03 ranks next in severity to that of 1791-92.\nIt was most felt in Kh\u00e1ndesh, Ahmadnagar, Shol\u00e1pur, Bij\u00e1pur, and Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r; but it also pressed severely on Belg\u00e1um, S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, Poona, Surat, and Cutch. This scarcity was mainly due to the ravages of Jaswant R\u00e1o Holkar and his Pind\u00e1ris, who destroyed the early crops as they were coming to maturity, and prevented the late crops being sown. This scarcity was followed by the failure of the late rains in 1803. The pressure was greatest in July and August 1804, and was so grievous that, according to tradition, men lived on human flesh. Grain is said to have been sold at a shilling the pound. In 1824\u201325, a failure of the early rains caused considerable and widespread scarcity. In 1862, a scanty fall of rain caused another scarcity.\n\nThe scanty and badly distributed rainfall of 1876 led to a failure of crops, and to distress amounting to famine over about one-half of the District. The east and south-east suffered most. In addition to this failure of the early rains, September and October passed with only a few showers, and but a small area of late crops was sown. With high prices, millet at seventeen instead of thirty-five pounds per rupee, and no demand for field work, the poorer classes fell into distress. The need for Government help began about the beginning of October. The long period of dry weather in July and August 1877 forced prices still higher, and caused much distress and suffering; but the plentiful and timely rainfall of September and October 1877 removed all cause of anxiety. By the close of November, the demand for special Government help had ceased. A special Census taken on the 19th May 1877, when famine pressure was general and severe, showed that of 46,235 labourers, 44,344 were on public and 1891 on civil works. As regards their occupation, 3062 were manufacturers or craftsmen, 24,611 were holders or under-holders of land, and 18,562 were labourers. The total cost of the famine was estimated at \u00a3118,137. In the eastern Sub-divisions the number of cattle fell from 994,272 in 1876\u201377 to 775,393 in 1877\u201378. In 1878, the tillage area fell short of that in 1876 by about 18,400 acres.\n\nCommerce and Manufactures.\u2014Besides kamblis (blankets) and coarse cotton cloth, the chief exports of the District are grain, tobacco, oil-seeds, chillies, molasses, and a little raw cotton. The imports are\u2014European piece-goods, hardware, paper, dried fruits, refined sugar, and salt. Weekly or bi-weekly markets are held in large villages and towns. Of these, Mhaswad is famous for its blankets, and Belandi for its cattle. Cotton is spun by women of the Kunb\u00ed, Mh\u00e1r, and M\u00e1ng castes. The yarn thus prepared is made up by Hindu weavers of the S\u00e1l\u00ed or Kosht\u00ed caste, and by Muhammadans, into cloth, tape, and ropes. Blankets (kamblis), which command a large sale, are woven by men of the Sangar caste. S\u00e1t\u00e1ra brass dishes and Shirol lamps are well known throughout the Deccan. Notwithstanding the great number of carpenters, wheels\nand axles for cart-making have to be brought from Chipl\u00fan in Ratn\u00e1giri. Paper is still manufactured to some extent.\n\n**Means of Communication.**\u2014Of the several lines of road in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, extending over a total length of 956 miles, the Poona and Belg\u00e1um road, crossing the District from north to south and bridged and metalled throughout, is the most important. One branch of this line breaks off at Kar\u00e1d, and runs along the valley of the Koina to Chipl\u00fan; while two other branches from Sur\u00fal and S\u00e1t\u00e1ra town, passing by W\u00e1i, go in the direction of Mah\u00e1baleshwar and then towards Mah\u00e1d, a Konkan seaport. The old Poona road by the Salpa Pass is now almost abandoned. Of the other lines that cross the District from east to west, the chief are the Pandharpur road and the two T\u00e1sg\u00f3on lines, one from S\u00e1t\u00e1ra town and one from Kar\u00e1d. Along these and the Belg\u00e1um line, a large bullock-cart traffic passes. Within the limits of the District, the Sahy\u00e1dri hills are crossed by thirteen roads or bullock tracks, of which the principal are the Kamatgi, Pasarni, Kumbh\u00e1rli, Var\u00e1ndha, and Fitzgerald. Besides houses for the use of District officers when on tour, village offices, ch\u00e1ud\u00eds, and temples, there are 243 dharm\u00e1s\u00e1las or rest-houses for the accommodation of travellers. The West Deccan line of the Southern Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 Railway, now under construction, will pass south and south-east through the centre of the District.\n\n**Administration.**\u2014The total revenue raised in 1882\u201383 under all heads, imperial, local, and municipal, amounted to \u00a3227,403, showing on a population of 1,062,350 an incidence of 4s. 3d. per head. The land-tax forms the principal source of revenue, amounting to \u00a3154,790, or 72'6 per cent. of the total amount. The other chief items are stamps, excise, forest, and local funds. The District local funds, created since 1863 for works of public utility and rural education, yielded \u00a318,919. The 13 municipalities contain an aggregate population of 108,259 persons. Their aggregate receipts amounted in 1882\u201383 to \u00a320,372, and the average incidence of taxation varied from 3d. to 10s. 5d. per head of population.\n\nThe administration of the District in revenue matter is, exclusive of the Superintendent of Malcolmpet, entrusted to a Collector and 6 Assistant Collectors, four of whom are covenanted civilians. For the settlement of civil disputes there are 8 courts. Thirty-nine officers share the administration of criminal justice. The total strength of the regular police force consisted in 1882 of 177 officers and 776 constables, giving 1 policeman to every 1113 persons of the population. The total cost was \u00a315,120, equal to \u00a33, 3s. per square mile of area and 3\u00bdd. per head of population. Besides the lock-up at each m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r's office, there is a District jail at S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, and three subordinate jails at Kar\u00e1d, Khat\u00e1o, and T\u00e1sg\u00f3on. The number of convicts in the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra jail on the 31st December 1882 was 84, of whom 24 were\nfemales; the number of convicts admitted during the year being 297.\n\nCompared with 114 schools and 1168 pupils in 1865, there were in 1877, 219 schools with a roll-call of 10,435 names. By 1882-83, the number of schools had reached 248, with 14,498 names, and an average attendance of 10,875. The first girls' school was opened in the town of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra in 1865. In 1882-83, the number of girls' schools was 5, with an average attendance of 260. The Census Report of 1881 returned 13,719 boys and 182 girls as under instruction, besides 27,678 males and 209 females as able to read and write, but not under instruction. Three vernacular papers, two of which have occasional English contributions, were published in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra District in 1882-83.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014According to the height and distance from the sea, the climate varies in different parts of the District. In the east, especially in the months of April and May, the heat is considerable. But near the Gh\u00e1ts it is much more moderate, being tempered by the sea-breeze. Again, while few parts of Western India have a heavier and more continuous rainfall than the western slope of the Sahy\u00e1dri hills, in some of the eastern Sub-divisions the supply is very scanty. The average annual rainfall at Mah\u00e1baleshwar is more than 252.8 inches, while in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra town it is only 40 inches, and in some places farther east it is less than 12. The west of the District draws almost its whole rain supply from the south-west monsoon, between June and October. Some of the eastern Sub-divisions, however, have a share in the north-east monsoon, and rain falls there in November and December. The May or 'mango showers,' as they are called, also influence the cultivator's prospects.\n\nSeven dispensaries and 2 civil hospitals, one at S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and the other at Malcolmpet, afforded medical relief to 477 in-door and 41,499 out-door patients in 1882-83, and 32,422 persons were vaccinated. Vital statistics showed a death-rate of 22.6 per thousand in 1882-83. [For further information regarding S\u00e1t\u00e1ra District, see the Gazetteer of Bombay Presidency, published under Government orders, and compiled by Mr. J. M. Campbell, C.S., vol. xix., S\u00e1t\u00e1ra District (Government Central Press, Bombay, 1885). Also the Bombay Census Report for 1881; and the several Administration and Departmental Reports of the Bombay Government from 1880 to 1884.]\n\nS\u00e1t\u00e1ra.\u2014Chief town of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra District, Bombay Presidency; situated in lat. 17\u00b0 41' 25\" N., and long. 74\u00b0 2' 10\" E., 56 miles south of Poona, near the confluence of the Kistna and the Yena, in the highlands of the Deccan, where the country generally inclines towards the east. The strong fort of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, midway between the Kistna and the Tornagh\u00e1t, is perched on the summit of a small, steep, rocky hill. It takes its name from the seventeen (s\u00e1t\u00e1ra) walls,\ntowers, and gates which it possessed, or is supposed to have possessed. At the close of the war with the Peshw\u00e1, in 1818, it fell, after a short resistance, into the hands of the British, who restored it with the adjacent territory to the representative of Sivaji's line, who, during the Peshwa's ascendency, had lived there as a State prisoner under the title of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra. In 1848, on the death of the last R\u00e1j\u00e1, the principality reverted to the British. The town of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, lying at the foot of the hill fortress, consisted in 1820 of one long street of tiled houses, built partly of stone and partly of brick. After the breaking up of the R\u00e1j\u00e1's court, the population considerably decreased. But S\u00e1t\u00e1ra is still a large place, ranking as the twelfth city in the Bombay Presidency, with a population in 1881 of 28,601 in the town, and 427 in the military lines; total, 29,028, namely, males 14,892, and females 14,136. Hindus numbered 24,525; Muhammadans, 3596; Jains, 284; Christians, 527; Parsis, 48; and 'others,' 48. Besides the courts of the Sub-divisional and District revenue officers, it possesses a District Judge's Court and a High School. The R\u00e1j\u00e1's palace is plain and commonplace. S\u00e1t\u00e1ra has few large or ornamental buildings, but the town is clean and the streets broad. On account of its high position, 2320 feet above sea-level, and its exposure to the sea-breeze, the climate is unusually pleasant. The water-supply is drawn by pipes from a reservoir on the hill of Enteshwar, and from three masonry ponds in the valley of Krishneshwar.\n\nS\u00e1t\u00e1ra J\u00e1g\u00edrs, The.\u2014Group of Native States in the Bombay Presidency, under the Political Superintendence of the Collectors of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and Shol\u00e1pur, comprising\u2014Akalkot, Aundh, Bhor, Daphlapur, Jath, and Phaltan. Of these Bhor lies in the north-west of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra District, Phaltan in the north, Aundh in the east, Jath in the extreme south-east, Daphlapur also in the south-east, and Akalkot in the south-east of Shol\u00e1pur. Total area, 3821 square miles. Revenue, about \u00a3157,800. The S\u00e1t\u00e1ra j\u00e1g\u00edrs were feudatory to the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, and became tributaries to the British Government on the lapse of that State in 1849. The j\u00e1g\u00edrd\u00e1rs retained all their former rights and privileges, with the exception of the power of life and death, and of adjudicating upon serious criminal cases. Their administration is now conducted on the principles of British law. Criminal and civil justice is administered by the chiefs themselves, with the aid of subordinate courts. In civil suits, special appeals from the decisions of j\u00e1g\u00edrd\u00e1rs lie to the Political Agents. In criminal cases, heinous offences requiring capital punishment or transportation for life are tried by the Political Agents, each assisted by two assessors, the preliminary proceedings being conducted by the j\u00e1g\u00edrd\u00e1rs. Criminal appeals from their decisions also lie to the Political Agents. The Collector of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra is in charge of the four j\u00e1g\u00edrs\nof Aundh, Bhor, Jath, and Phaltan, and of the little cluster of six villages (rent-roll of \u00a31300; area, 40 square miles; population (1881) 6007; revenue, \u00a3900) belonging to the Bhai Sahab of Daphlapur, who exercises the powers of a magistrate of the first class, and in civil suits those of a subordinate judge. Akalkot is under the Collector of Sholapur. Population (1881) of the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra j\u00e1girs, 376,727, namely, males 190,497, and females 186,230, occupying 54,139 houses, in 3 towns and 838 villages. Hindus numbered 354,242; Muhammadans, 16,747; and 'others,' 5738.\n\nSat\u00e1sgarh (or 'Sixty Towers').\u2014Ruin in Panduah Town, Maldah District, Bengal.\u2014See Panduah.\n\nS\u00e1tg\u00e1on (or Saptagram, 'The Seven Villages,' so called from seven sages who gave their names to the same number of villages).\u2014Ruined town in H\u00fagl\u00ed District, Bengal. Lat. 22\u00b0 38' 20\" N., long. 88\u00b0 25' 10\" E. The mercantile capital of Bengal from the Pur\u00e1nic age until the foundation of Hugli by the Portuguese. The decay of this port dates from the silting up of the channel of the Saraswati, and nothing now remains to indicate its former grandeur except a ruined mosque; the modern village consists of a few miserable huts. S\u00e1tg\u00e1on is said to have been one of the resting-places of Bh\u00e1girath\u00ed. De Barros writes that it was 'less frequented than Chittagong, on account of the port not being so convenient for the entrance and departure of ships.' Purchas states it to be 'a fair citie for a citie of the Moores, and very plentiful, but sometimes subject to Patnaw.' In 1632, when H\u00fagl\u00ed was declared a royal port, all the public offices were withdrawn from S\u00e1tg\u00e1on, which rapidly fell into ruins. [For a full description of the ancient S\u00e1tg\u00e1on, see Statistical Account of Bengal, vol. iii. pp. 307\u2013310.]\n\nSathamba.\u2014Petty State in Mahi K\u00e1ntha, Bombay Presidency. Population (1881) 5360. Estimated revenue, \u00a3825, of which \u00a340, 2s. is paid as tribute to the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda, \u00a356, 2s. to B\u00e1las\u00ednor, and \u00a312, 14s. to Lun\u00e1w\u00e1ra. The chief, Th\u00e1kur Aj\u00e1b Singh, is a Baria Kol\u00ed. The family holds no deed allowing adoption; in matters of succession it follows the rule of primogeniture. Area under cultivation, about 5000 acres. Staple crops, rice and jod\u00e1r. One school, with 74 pupils.\n\nS\u00e1than.\u2014Town in Sult\u00e1npur District, Oudh; pleasantly situated on high ground overlooking the G\u00famti river, 40 miles north-west of Sult\u00e1npur town. Founded by S\u00e1than, a Bhar, and called after him. After the Mutiny of 1857, a certain Sh\u00e1h Abd\u00fal Lat\u00edf settled here as a 'missionary of pure religion,' and built a mosque, at which hundreds of the Sunni sect assemble every Friday. The 'idg\u00e1h of S\u00e1than is a place of considerable resort for the faithful at the 'Id festival. Population (1881) 1566, namely, Hindus 818, and Muhammadans 748, principally Sayyids and Shaikhs.\nS\u00e1tkhir\u00e1.\u2014Sub-division of Khuln\u00e1 District, Bengal, lying between 21\u00b0 38' and 22\u00b0 56' 45\" N. lat., and between 88\u00b0 56' 30\" and 89\u00b0 4' E. long. Area, 702 square miles; towns and villages, 1155; houses, 59,564. Population (1881) 434,766, namely, males 228,949, and females 205,817; proportion of males, 52.7 per cent. Average number of persons per square mile, 619; villages per square mile, 1.65; persons per village, 376; houses per square mile, 87; inmates per house, 7.3. This Sub-division consists of the 5 police circles of S\u00e1tkhir\u00e1, Kal\u00e1ro\u00e1, M\u00e1gur\u00e1, K\u00e1l\u00edganj, and As\u00e1sun\u00ed. In 1884 it contained 2 civil and 4 criminal courts, a regular police of 92 men, and a rural force 810 strong.\n\nS\u00e1tkhir\u00e1.\u2014Chief town of S\u00e1tkhir\u00e1 Sub-division, Twenty-four Parg\u00e1nas District, Bengal; situated on the Betn\u00e1 river, in lat. 22\u00b0 42' 35\" N., and long. 89\u00b0 7' 55\" E. Population (1881) 8738, namely, Muhammadans 4391, and Hindus 4347. Municipal income (1883\u201384), \u00a3406, of which \u00a3376 was derived from taxation; average incidence of taxation, 10\u00bdd. per head of the population. The town contains many Hindu temples; a large vernacular school or paths\u00e1la, entirely supported by the zamind\u00e1r; and a Government dispensary, in charge of a native sub-assistant surgeon. Once a rural village, S\u00e1tkhir\u00e1 is now an important town, a canal having been cut to the Ich\u00e1m\u00e1t\u00ed river; fair roads lead to the nearest marts of traffic, thus making it an emporium for the sale and shipment of the produce of the surrounding country. Large trade in sugar and rice.\n\nSatlaj.\u2014One of the five rivers of the Punjab.\u2014See Sutlej.\n\nSatl\u00e1sn\u00e1.\u2014Native State in the Political Agency of Mahi K\u00e1ntha, Bombay Presidency. Population (1881) 3281. The principal agricultural products are millet, wheat, Indian corn, and sugar-cane. The present (1882\u201383) chief is Th\u00e1kur Hari Singh, a Hindu of the Parm\u00e1r Kol\u00ed tribe. He is thirty-four years of age, and manages his estate in person. He enjoys an estimated gross revenue of \u00a3450; and pays a tribute of \u00a3168 to the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda, and \u00a373 to the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Edar. The family of the chief follow the rule of primogeniture in point of succession. There is 1 school in the State, with 43 pupils.\n\nSatodar W\u00e1ori.\u2014Petty State in the H\u00e1ll\u00e1r prant or division of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay Presidency; consisting of 4 villages, with 4 shareholders or tribute-payers. Area, 13 square miles. Population (1881) 2447. Estimated revenue, \u00a31200; of which \u00a3146, 12s. is paid as tribute to the British Government, and \u00a346, 2s. to the Naw\u00e1b of Jun\u00e1garh.\n\nSatp\u00e1ti.\u2014Port in Th\u00e1na (Tanna) District, Bombay Presidency; situated about 6 miles north of M\u00e1him. One of the ports of the T\u00e1r\u00e1pur Customs Division. Average annual value of trade for five years ending\n1881\u201382\u2014imports \u00a31831, and exports \u00a36155. The trade in 1881\u201382 was\u2014imports \u00a32950, and exports \u00a36882.\n\n**S\u00e1tpura.**\u2014Hill range or table-land, which begins at Amarkantak and extends westward across the Central Provinces, and beyond them nearly to the western coast. The name was formerly restricted to that portion of the range which divides the Narbad\u00e1 (Nerbudda) and T\u00e1pti valleys; while sometimes the term Vindhya has been extended to include the S\u00e1tpuras, together with the parallel range on the northern side of the Narbad\u00e1, in one general appellation for the great chain which stretches across Central India and separates Hindust\u00e1n proper from the Deccan. Geologically, however, the Vindhyan sandstones are entirely distinct from the Mah\u00e1deo and other groups which enter into the composition of the S\u00e1tpuras; and geographically, the line of demarcation between the two ranges is defined by the well-marked valley of a great river.\n\nTaking Amarkantak as the eastern boundary, the S\u00e1tpuras stretch from east to west for about 600 miles, while their greatest breadth from north to south exceeds 100 miles. The range forms a rough triangle. From Amarkantak, 3328 feet above sea-level, an outer ridge runs southwest for about 100 miles to the Saletekri Hills in Bhand\u00e1r\u00e1 District. This ridge, known as the Maikal range, constitutes the base of the triangle. Starting from this base, the S\u00e1tpura range shrinks, as it proceeds westward, from a broad table-land to two parallel dorsal ridges, bounding on either side the valley of the T\u00e1pti. Just east of Asirgarh occurs a break, through which the Great Indian Peninsula Railway from Bombay and Kh\u00e1ndesh to Jabalpur is carried; and Asirgarh marks the point where the S\u00e1tpuras leave the Central Provinces.\n\nFollowing the range from east to west, the main features which it presents may be thus described. In Mandl\u00e1 District, the slope is mainly northward towards the Narbad\u00e1. There are four principal upland valleys, each sending down a feeder to that river. The eastern valleys are higher than those to the west. Between the Kharmer and Burhner rivers, the country consists of a rugged mass of bare and lofty mountains hurled together by volcanic action. Their general formation is basaltic, intermixed with laterite, with which the higher peaks are capped. The Chaur\u00e1d\u00e1dar plateau, 3300 feet high, has an area of 6 square miles.\n\nIn Seoni District, the plateaux of Seoni and Lakhn\u00e1don are from 1800 to 2220 feet high. The slope of the country is from north to south; and in the lowest watershed, the Waingang\u00e1 river rises. In Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1, also, the country slopes southwards. The principal upland valleys are those of the Pench and Kolbir\u00e1. The general elevation is about 2200 feet, but the plateau of Mot\u00far attains a height of 3500 feet. In Bet\u00fal, the slope to the south continues; and the T\u00e1pti rises\nand flows in a deep and narrow gorge. In the south-west corner of the District, the hill of Kh\u00e1m\u00e1 rises 3700 feet high. To the north of Bet\u00fal, spurs from the S\u00e1tpuras occupy a considerable portion of Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d. Dh\u00fapgarh (4454 feet) is the highest point; and the picturesque plateau of Pachmarh\u00ed, 3481 feet above sea-level, covers an area of 12 square miles.\n\nSouth of Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d, sandstone and metamorphic rocks emerge, and form a great portion of the hills of the Bet\u00fal and Pachmarh\u00ed country. To the east, trap predominates. In Nim\u00e1r District, the wild and barren range which parts the valleys of the T\u00e1pti and the Narbad\u00e1 has an average width of 15 miles. On its highest point stands the fortress of As\u00edrgarh.\n\nWest of As\u00edrgarh, the S\u00e1tpura hills form a broad belt of mountain land, stretching in a wall-like line along the north bank of the T\u00e1pti. They rise from the first range of hills, ridge behind ridge, to the central crest about 2000 feet high, and then slope gently to the Narbad\u00e1. The Bombay-Agra trunk road crosses the S\u00e1tpuras farther west. Among the peaks that rise from 3000 to 3800 feet above sea-level, the grandest is Turanm\u00e1l, a long, rather narrow table-land 3300 feet above the sea, and about 16 square miles in area. West of Turanm\u00e1l, the mountain land presents, both towards the T\u00e1pti and the Narbad\u00e1, a wall-like appearance.\n\n**S\u00e1tpura.**\u2014State forest lying along the southern slopes of the S\u00e1tpura hills, in Seoni, Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 and N\u00e1gpur Districts, Central Provinces. Area, about 1000 square miles. S\u00e1j forms the chief growth in the eastern, and teak in the western portion. The proximity of K\u00e1mthi (Kamptee) and N\u00e1gpur has caused the exhaustion of all but young timber; but what remains is now strictly preserved, and plantation experiments have been conducted at Suk\u00e1ta and Sit\u00e1jhari.\n\n**Satrikh.**\u2014Pargan\u00e1 in Bara Banki District, Oudh; bounded on the north by Naw\u00e1bganj and Part\u00e1bgarh, on the east by Siddhaur, on the south by Haidargarh, and on the west by Dewa. Area, 46 square miles, or 29,404 acres, of which 19,318 acres are cultivated. Population (1881) 22,570, namely, males 11,492, and females 11,078. Number of houses, 4238. Of the 42 villages comprising the pargan\u00e1, 17 are held in t\u00e1lukd\u00e1ri, 20 in zamind\u00e1ri, and 5 in pattid\u00e1ri tenure. Government land revenue, \u00a34796.\n\n**Satrikh.**\u2014Town in Bara Banki District, Oudh, and head-quarters of Satrikh pargan\u00e1; situated 5 miles south-east of Bara Banki town, in lat. 26\u00b0 51' 30\" N., and long. 81\u00b0 14' 10\" E. Population (1881) 4090, namely, Hindus 2458, and Muhammadans 1632. Number of houses, 843. The town was originally founded by a Hindu R\u00e1j\u00e1 named Sabtrikh, but was captured by the Muhammadans under S\u00e1l\u00e1r Sahu, a brother-in-law of Mahm\u00fad of Ghazn\u00ed. S\u00e1l\u00e1r Sahu died here, and\nan annual fair is held at his shrine, attended by about 18,000 persons.\n\n**Satrunjaya (Shetrunjya).**\u2014Sacred hill near Palitana, in the Gohelwar prant or division of Kathiawar, Bombay Presidency.\u2014See Palitana Town.\n\n**Sattanapalli.**\u2014Taluk or Sub-division of Kistna District, Madras Presidency. Area, 714 square miles. Population (1881) 110,290, namely, males 55,695, and females 54,595, occupying 18,752 houses in 169 villages. Hindus number 94,862; Muhammadans, 9086; and Christians, 6342. A wide extent of black soil is found in the taluk, producing heavy crops of cotton. In the black soil, gneissic rock protrudes here and there. In this taluk are the fortresses of Bellamkonda and Dharanikota near Amravati town. Sattanapalli contained in 1883\u2014criminal courts, 2; police circles (thanas), 7; regular police, 53 men. Land revenue, \u00a336,790. Head-quarters at Krossur; population (1881) 1912, occupying 327 houses.\n\n**Sattankulam.**\u2014Town in Tenkarai taluk, Tinnevelly District, Madras Presidency. Population (1881) 5116, occupying 1261 houses. Hindus number 3697; Muhammadans, 392; Christians, 1019; and \u2018others\u2019, 8. Important agricultural town, with wealthy inhabitants engaged in money-lending.\n\n**Satur.**\u2014Taluk or Sub-division of Tinnevelly District, Madras Presidency. Area, 548 square miles. Population (1881) 150,886, namely, males 73,382, and females 77,504, occupying 31,945 houses, in 2 towns and 212 villages. Hindus number 145,425; Muhammadans, 3052; Christians, 2409. The northern and eastern villages are part of the black cotton plain of Tinnevelly District; the southern and south-western consist of red loam and sand. The latter or red soil portion is considerably larger in area than the former. Cotton is the staple produce; and kambu (Pennisetum typhoideum) and gram are also grown, as well as tobacco, chillies, and vegetables. About one-fifth of the taluk is inam, one-fourth zamindari, and the remainder Government. The South Indian Railway main line traverses the taluk. In 1883, Satur contained 2 criminal courts; police circles (thanas), 9; regular police, 76 men. Land revenue, \u00a321,773.\n\n**Satur.**\u2014Village in Satur taluk, Tinnevelly District, Madras Presidency; situated on the north bank of Vaipar river, and a station on the South Indian Railway main line, 55 miles north of Tinnevelly town.

Population (1881) 3210, inhabiting 634 houses. Hindus number 2899; Muhammadans, 253; Christians, 55; and 'others,' 3. The fort is situated on the Bhav\u00e1n\u00ed river, and was built by the Naiks of Madura. It was taken by the Mysore generals in 1657. Owing to its situation, Satyamangalam was of considerable strategic importance in our wars with Haidar Ali and Tip\u00fa. Colonel Wood took the place in 1768, but Haidar recaptured it the following year. In 1790, Colonel Floyd occupied Satyamangalam, and between the fort and Danayakkankottai fought a severe battle with Tip\u00fa in the same year, falling back upon Meadow's column, but effecting his retreat with such skill as almost to convert it into a victory. There are two gh\u00e1t roads to the uplands from Satyamangalam\u2014the Gazzalh\u00e1tti and the Hassan\u00far roads. The latter is the most frequented route into Mysore.\n\nSauda.\u2014Sub-division and town, Kh\u00e1ndesh District, Bombay Presidency.\u2014See SAVDA.\n\nSaugor.\u2014District, Sub-division, and Town, in the Central Provinces.\u2014See SAGAR.\n\nSaugor.\u2014Island at the mouth of the H\u00fagl\u00ed river, Bengal.\u2014See SAGAR.\n\nSaundatti.\u2014Chief town of the Parasgarh Sub-division of Belg\u00e1um District, Bombay Presidency; situated 41 miles east by south of Belg\u00e1um town, in lat. 15\u00b0 45' 50\" N., and long. 75\u00b0 9' 40\" E.

S\u00e1v\u00e1li is the trade centre of a wide circle of villages. In the immediate neighbourhood are wide tanks, shady trees, and fruitful fields; at no great distance is the wild Mehwasi country of ravines and jungles bordering the Mahi. At one of the corners of the beautiful S\u00e1v\u00e1li tank stand two temples which commemorate the names of Dam\u00e1ji and his father Pil\u00e1ji. The treacherous murder, the invasion of Abhi Singh, the hasty funeral of the founder of the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r house, mark a crisis in the history of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 conquest, and give something of historic dignity to the unpretending temple of Pil\u00e1ji. Custom-house, post and police offices, and dispensary.\n\nSavandrug.\u2014Hill fort in Bangalore District, Mysore State, locally known as the Magadi Hill, 4024 feet above sea-level. Lat. 12\u00b0 55' N., long. 77\u00b0 21' E. It consists of an enormous mass of granite, standing\non a base 8 miles in circumference. The summit is divided by a chasm into two peaks\u2014the Kari or black, and the Bili or white\u2014each of which is abundantly supplied with water. The earliest fortifications are said to have been erected in 1543, by S\u00e1mana R\u00e1ya, who gave the hill his own name of S\u00e1mana-durga. The present appellation dates from the end of the 16th century, when Immadi Kempe Gauda of Bangalore established his stronghold here, in which his family maintained themselves until 1728. The fort was captured in that year by the Hindu R\u00e1ja of Mysore, from whom it passed into the hands of Haidar \u00c1lf.\n\nIn 1791, Savandr\u00fag was stormed by a British army commanded by Lord Cornwallis. On December 10, a force under Colonel Stuart encamped within 3 miles of the place; and after great difficulties in bringing up the battering train, the bombardment was opened on the 20th, and in three days the breach was declared practicable. The assault was delivered on the following day under the eyes of Lord Cornwallis. The whole line of fortifications was carried within an hour, without the loss of a single life on the British side.\n\n**Savan\u00far (Sawan\u00far).**\u2014Native State, situated within Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r District, Bombay Presidency; lying between $14^\\circ 56' 45''$ and $15^\\circ 1' 45''$ N. lat., and between $75^\\circ 21' 45''$ and $75^\\circ 25'$ E. long. Area, 70 square miles. Population (1872) 17,288; (1881) 14,763, namely, males 7347, and females 7416, occupying 2646 houses, in 1 town and 23 villages. Hindus number 10,866; Muhammadans, 3859; and \u2018others,\u2019 38.\n\nThe principal products are cotton, jo\u00e1r (Sorghum vulgare), rice, kulthi (Dolichos biflorus), m\u00fang (Phaseolus Mungo), cocoa-nut, castor-oil, tur (Cajanus indicus), p\u00e1n (Piper Betle), wheat, gram, plantains, and sugar-cane. Of the total area of 44,660 acres, 40,055 are cultivable; area under actual cultivation in 1883\u201384, 31,707 acres. Coarse cloths, such as sar\u00eds, dholis, etc., are manufactured to a small extent; and one loom for weaving silk cloths (pitambar) is worked. Some trade in grain. The betel-leaf grown in the Savan\u00far gardens is celebrated for its superior quality. Within the State there is only one forest, at Mulakari.\n\nBefore Savan\u00far came under Tip\u00fa Sult\u00e1n (1785), there was a mint at which gold coins were struck called Savan\u00far Huns, bearing the name of the reigning Naw\u00e1b and valued at 6s. 8d.\n\nThe reigning family are Muhammadans of Afgh\u00e1n descent. Abd\u00fal Ra\u00faf Kh\u00e1n, the founder of the family, obtained in 1680 from the Emperor Aurangzeb the grant of the j\u00e1gir of Bank\u00e1pur, Torgal, and Az\u00ednnagar, with a command of 7000 horse. The family, though connected by marriage with Tip\u00fa Sult\u00e1n, was entirely stript of its possessions by him; and the Naw\u00e1b sought the protection of the Peshw\u00e1, from whom he received a pension of \u00a34800 per annum. This was subsequently converted into a grant of territory, yielding an equal amount of revenue, through the intervention of General Wellesley.\nThe management of the State, which had since 1868 been under the care of the Collector of Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r as Political Agent, was handed over in 1883 to Naw\u00e1b Abd\u00fal Dalil Kh\u00e1n, a young man of great promise, who had been carefully educated at R\u00e1j\u00e1r\u00e1m College, Kolh\u00e1pur. The young chief died in 1884. Strength of police, 66 men; cost of maintaining the force, \u00a3493. Criminal courts, 2; schools, 7. Average annual rainfall, 27\u00b73 inches.\n\n**Savan\u00far.**\u2014Chief town of Savan\u00far State, Bombay Presidency. Lat. 14\u00b0 58' N., long. 75\u00b0 23' 5\" E.; situated 40 miles south-east of Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r. Population (1881) 7640, namely, Hindus, 4582; Muhammadans, 3031; and Jains, 27. The town is nearly circular, and covers an area of three-quarters of a square mile. It is enclosed by a ditch with eight gates, three of which are ruined. Between 1868 and 1876 the town was greatly improved, the roads widened and metalled, and many old wells and ponds repaired. Income of municipality in 1883\u201384, \u00a3629. Three schools with 218 pupils, of whom 60 were girls. Annual fair.\n\n**Savari** *(Seberi, Severi).*\u2014River in Madras Presidency. \u2014 See SABARI.\n\n**S\u00e1vda.**\u2014Sub-division of Kh\u00e1ndesh District, Bombay Presidency. Area, 553 square miles. Population (1872) 124,519; (1881) 141,745, namely, males 71,720, and females 70,025, occupying 24,767 houses, in 4 towns and 178 villages. Hindus number 123,395; Muhammadans, 16,033; and \u2018others,\u2019 2317. S\u00e1vda lies in the north-east of Kh\u00e1ndesh District, and includes the petty divisions of Y\u00e1val and R\u00e1veri. The Sub-division is a well-wooded, unbroken plain, from which, along the north, the S\u00e1tpuras rise in a wall-like line. Though highly cultivated and thickly peopled, it is not on the whole well provided with water, excepting in the villages along the T\u00e1pti and the S\u00faki. Despite extreme heat from March to June, the climate is healthy. The prevailing soil is a black alluvial clay from four to five feet deep, resting on a subsoil of soft yellowish clay (*m\u00e1n*). This black soil is best in the centre, and grows poorer towards the river on the south and the hills on the north. In 1854\u201355, the year of settlement, 12,970 holdings or *kh\u00e1t\u00e1s* were recorded with an average area of 16\u00b73 acres, paying an average assessment of \u00a31, 9s. 6d. In 1878\u201379, the area under actual cultivation was 217,874 acres. Cereals and millets occupied 125,846 acres; pulses, 11,902 acres; oil-seeds, 18,925 acres; fibres, 54,421 acres; and miscellaneous crops, 6780 acres. In 1883 the Sub-division contained 1 civil and 5 criminal courts; police circles (*th\u00e1n\u00e1s*), 3; regular police, 119 men; village watch (*chaukiddirs*), 691. Land revenue, \u00a330,844.\n\n**S\u00e1vda.**\u2014Chief town of the S\u00e1vda Sub-division of Kh\u00e1ndesh District, Bombay Presidency, and a station on the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, 285 miles north-east of Bombay city; situated in lat. 21\u00b0 8' 30'' N., and long. 75\u00b0 56' E. Population (1881) 8642, namely, Hindus,\n7061; Muhammadans, 1324; Jains, 236; Christians, 6; P\u00e1rs\u00eds, 2; and 'others,' 13. S\u00e1vda was finally ceded by the Niz\u00e1m to the Peshw\u00e1 in 1763, and was shortly afterwards bestowed on Sard\u00e1r R\u00e1ste, whose daughter was given in marriage to the Peshw\u00e1. In 1852, in connection with the introduction of the revenue survey, a serious disturbance occurred at S\u00e1vda. From 10,000 to 15,000 malcontents gathered, and were not dispersed till a detachment of troops arrived and seized 59 of the ringleaders. A municipality has recently been established and had an income in 1883-84 of \u00a3233; incidence of taxation, 5\u00bdd. per head. Chief trade, cotton, gram, linseed, and wheat. Post-office; three schools. At the weekly market, valuable Nim\u00e1r and Berar cattle are offered for sale.\n\nS\u00e1vitri (Savatri). \u2014 River of Bombay Presidency, rising on the western declivity of the Mah\u00e1baleshwar range, S\u00e1t\u00e1ra District, in lat. 18\u00b0 28' N., and long. 73\u00b0 30' E. Descending the mountain side in a narrow rocky channel, it passes the towns of Mhar and D\u00e1sg\u00e1on through Southern Kol\u00e1ba, and reaches Ratn\u00e1giri District at Mah\u00e1pral. After a total course of about 50 miles, it falls into the Arabian Sea at B\u00e1nkot in lat. 17\u00b0 58' N., and long. 73\u00b0 3' E. The mouth of the S\u00e1vitri is formed by bluff hills, jutting out on either side of the creek into the sea. Fort Victoria or B\u00e1nkot crowns the southern headland. B\u00e1nkot is only a fair-weather port. The passage is marked by buoys and beacons, but a rather formidable sand-bar, with a depth of 2\u00bd fathoms at low water, lies across the entrance to the anchorage. The river is navigable, for native craft drawing 7 feet of water, 36 miles to the town of Mhar in Kol\u00e1ba District; for vessels of 16 feet, up to Mah\u00e1pral in Ratn\u00e1giri, about 24 miles from the mouth. Between B\u00e1nkot and Mah\u00e1pral there is no difficulty; large craft work up on a single tide. Between Mah\u00e1pral and Mhar the river narrows; shoals and rocky ledges and reefs are numerous; and even for small craft, navigation is both difficult and dangerous. Every year within these limits the creek is silting and becoming more difficult. After the first two or three miles, the scenery of the creek is particularly striking. The hills rising boldly from the water's edge to a considerable height are, especially on the northern bank, clad with thick forests, which on some of the reaches surround the water on all sides, giving the creek the appearance of a mountain lake. Farther inland, the hills draw back, giving place to broad belts of lowland, divided from the water by mangrove swamps. Before Mhar is reached, the banks have become flat and uninteresting.\n\nS\u00e1wantw\u00e1ri. \u2014 Native State in Bombay Presidency, under the charge of a Political Superintendent; situated about 200 miles south of Bombay city, between 15\u00b0 38' 30\" and 16\u00b0 14' N. lat., and between 73\u00b0 37' and 74\u00b0 23' E. long. Area, about 900 square miles. Population (1872) 190,814, and (1881) 174,433. The State is bounded on the\nnorth and west by the British District of Ratn\u00e1giri, on the east by the Sahy\u00e1dri Hills, and on the south by the Portuguese territory of Goa. The general aspect of the country is strikingly picturesque. From the sea-coast to the foot of the Sahy\u00e1dri hills, a distance varying from 20 to 25 miles, are densely wooded hills, and in the valleys, gardens and groves of cocoa-nut and areca-nut palms. The chief streams are the K\u00e1rli on the north, and the Terekhol on the south, which open out into creeks. Both are navigable for small native craft; the Terekhol for about 15, and the K\u00e1rli for about 14 miles. The climate is humid and relaxing, with a heavy rainfall, averaging for the 32 years ending 1879, 143 inches, varying from 222 inches in 1874 to 93 inches in 1855. April is the hottest month in the year; but in May (though the temperature is slightly higher) a strong sea-breeze, the precursor of the south-west monsoon, tempers the heat.\n\nThe State is rich in forests of teak, especially near the Sahy\u00e1dri Hills, blackwood, ain (Terminalia tomentosa), kher (Acacia Catechu), j\u00e1mba (Xylia dolabriformis). Nearer the sea, the more important trees are the jackwood, mango, and bhirand (Garcinia indica), whose fruit yields kokam oil. The principal fruits are mangoes and plantains, which are abundant and of excellent quality, citrons, limes, and jack fruit. Cocoanuts and cashew-nuts are very plentiful. The staple agricultural produce is rice; but the quantity grown is not sufficient for the wants of the people, and a good deal is imported. Excepting rice, none but the coarsest grains and pulses are raised. A species of oil-seed, til (Sesamum indicum), hemp, and black and red pepper, are also grown, but neither cotton nor tobacco. Both soil and climate are against the cultivation of wheat and other superior grains. For these, the people have to look to the country east of the Sahy\u00e1dri Hills, whence during the fair season, from October to June, large supplies come. Coffee has been grown with success, and it is believed that the spurs from the Sahy\u00e1dri range are suited to its cultivation on a large scale. Iron-ore of fair quality is found in the neighbourhood of the R\u00e1mgh\u00e1t, in the Sahy\u00e1dri range. The Akeri stone, a slate-coloured talc-schist, extremely hard, compact, and heavy, is unrivalled for building purposes. Laterite is quarried in many places. Talc of inferior quality is found at Kud\u00e1wal.\n\nThe forests and wooded slopes of Sahy\u00e1dri hills contain large numbers of tigers, leopards, bison, s\u00e1mbhar deer, etc. In 1883\u201384, locusts visited the State for the sixth successive year, but in smaller numbers than on previous occasions. About 12 millions of locusts were destroyed.\n\nPopulation.\u2014Population (1881) 174,433, namely, males 86,061, and females 88,372, occupying 30,444 houses, in 1 town and 225 villages. Hindus number 166,080; Muhammadans, 3970; Christians, 4213; and \u2018others,\u2019 170. The Christians are all Roman Catholics, and consist\nof Indo-Portuguese and natives who have embraced Christianity. The common language of the people is a dialect of Mar\u00e1th\u00ed, known as Kurauli. The sturdy and easily managed Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s and Mhars of this State are favourite recruits for the Bombay Native Infantry regiments. The inhabitants generally are poor, and are engaged chiefly in agriculture.\n\nManufactures.\u2014Salt of an inferior kind was formerly manufactured, but the salt pans have recently been abolished. The principal industries of the State consist of gold and silver embroidery work on both leather and cloth; fans, baskets, and boxes of khas-khas grass, ornamented with gold thread and beetles' wings; lacquered toys, and playing cards; and elegant drawing-room ornaments carved from the horn of the buffalo and bison. Recently a pottery establishment for the manufacture of tiles has been opened. The pottery is now becoming widely known, and it is expected that a ready sale will be found for the tiles not required by the State.\n\nMeans of Communication.\u2014There are no railways; but an excellent trunk road has recently been constructed from the seaport of Vengurla, which, passing through the State, leads by an easy gradient over the Sahy\u00e1dri Hills to Belg\u00e1um and the Southern Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 Country. The other chief lines of communication with the Deccan are the R\u00e1mgh\u00e1t, the Talkatgh\u00e1t, and the Phond\u00e1gh\u00e1t.\n\nTrade.\u2014Within the limits of the State there is not much local trade; but during the fair season, a considerable quantity of cotton, hemp, and grain from the rich Districts of the Southern Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 Country passes coastwards, especially to the port of Vengurla. Compared with the exports, the imports at Vengurla are small.\n\nHistory.\u2014Early inscriptions show that from the 6th to the 8th centuries the Ch\u00e1lukyas ruled over S\u00e1wantw\u00e1ri. In the 10th century, the rulers were Y\u00e1davs. In the 13th century (1261), the Ch\u00e1lukyas were again in power. At the close of the 14th century (1391), S\u00e1wantw\u00e1ri was under an officer of the Vijayanagar dynasty. About the middle of the 15th century it formed part of a powerful Br\u00e1hman dynasty. On the establishment of the Bij\u00e1pur power at the close of the 15th century, S\u00e1wantw\u00e1ri became part of the territory of these kings. About three hundred years ago (1554), one Mang S\u00e1want of the Bhonsla family revolted from Bij\u00e1pur, and making Hodw\u00e1ra, a small village 9 miles from W\u00e1ri, his head-quarters, defeated the troops sent against him, and maintained his independence during his lifetime. After his death, his successors again became feudatories of the Bij\u00e1pur kings.\n\nThe chief who finally freed his country from the Muhammadan yoke was Khem S\u00e1want Bhonsla, who ruled from 1627 to 1640. He was succeeded by his son, Som S\u00e1want, who, after ruling for\neighteen months, was succeeded by his brother Lakham S\u00e1want. When the power of Sivaji seemed in the ascendant (1650), Lakham S\u00e1want tendered him allegiance, and was confirmed as Sar Desai of the whole South Konkan. Dying in 1665, Lakham was succeeded by his brother Phond S\u00e1want, who, after ruling for ten years, was succeeded by his son, Khem S\u00e1want II. This chief was a contemporary of S\u00e1hu, the grandson and second successor of Sivaji, who assigned to him, conjointly with the chief of Kol\u00e1ba, half the revenue of the S\u00e1lsi Mahal. It was during the time of Khem\u2019s successor (1709\u20131737) that the S\u00e1wantw\u00e1ri State first entered into relations with the British Government. A treaty was concluded between them against the notorious piratical chieftain, Kanoj\u00ed Angria of Kol\u00e1ba.\n\nThe chief who ruled from 1755 to 1803, under the name of Khem S\u00e1want the Great, married in 1763 the daughter of Jaya\u00ed Sindhia; and consequently the title of R\u00e1i Bah\u00e1dur was conferred upon him by the Emperor of Delhi. The chieftain of Kolh\u00e1pur, envious of this honour, made a descent on W\u00e1ri, and captured several hill fortresses, which were, however, through Sindhia\u2019s influence, subsequently restored. The rule of Khem S\u00e1want, who, not content with wars on land, also took to piracy, was one long contest against Kolh\u00e1pur, the Peshw\u00e1, the Portuguese, and the British. Khem S\u00e1want died childless in 1803; and the contest for the succession was not decided till 1805, when Khem S\u00e1want\u2019s widow, Lakshmib\u00e1\u00ed, adopted a child, R\u00e1mchandra S\u00e1want alias Bh\u00e1u S\u00e1hib. This child lived for three years, and was then (1805) strangled in bed. Phond S\u00e1want, a minor, was chosen to fill his place. During these years of disorder the ports swarmed with pirates. So severely did British commerce suffer, that in 1812 Phond S\u00e1want was forced to enter into a treaty, ceding the port of Vengurla to the British, and engaging to give up all his vessels of war. Soon after the conclusion of this treaty, Phond S\u00e1want died, and was succeeded by his son, Khem S\u00e1want, a child of eight years. This chief, when he came of age, proved unable to manage his estate, and after several revolutions and much disturbance, at last in 1838 agreed to make over the administration to the British Government. After this, rebellion twice broke out (in 1839 and 1844), but the disturbances were soon suppressed, and the country has since remained quiet.\n\nThe present (1884\u201385) chief is Sar Des\u00e1i Raghun\u00e1th R\u00e1o S\u00e1want Bhonsla, who is not yet considered fit to be entrusted with the duties of government. He has been educated at the R\u00e1jkum\u00e1r College at R\u00e1jkot. He is entitled to a salute of 9 guns. He enjoys an estimated gross revenue of \u00a332,500, and maintains a military force of 436 men, styled the S\u00e1wantw\u00e1ri Local Corps. The family of the chief\nhold a title authorizing adoption, and in point of succession follow the rule of primogeniture. Strength of police, 155; cost in 1883\u201384, \u00a32479.

Dyeing is the only industry of consequence. The nearest port is Dholera. S\u00e1yla ranks officially as a 'third-class' State in K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r; and the ruler executed the usual engagements in 1807. The present chief (1882\u201383), Th\u00e1kur Wakhat Singhji, a Hindu of the Jhala R\u00e1jput caste, is thirty-eight years old, and administers his estate in person. He enjoys an estimated gross revenue of \u00a37500, and pays a tribute of \u00a31551, 2s. jointly to the British Government and the Naw\u00e1b of Jun\u00e1g\u00e1hr.

The town, which in 1876 contained an estimated population of 6324, mainly supported by river traffic, had in 1881 only 3269 inhabitants. There is still a considerable import trade in cotton, spices, iron, copper, brass, and bell-metal utensils; but the rising mart of Bo\u00e1lm\u00e1ri, $2\\frac{1}{2}$ miles to the south and on the river bank, has attracted most of the business formerly carried on at Sayyidpur, which is now a decaying town. Fine sitalp\u00e1ti mats are made in the neighbourhood. The town was formerly a municipality, now (1883) abolished.\n\nSayyidpur.\u2014Western tahs\u00edl of Gh\u00e1zipur District, North-Western Provinces; situated in the angle formed by the junction of the Gumti with the Ganges.

Population (1881) 74,124. Secunder\u00e1b\u00e1d cantonment, named after Niz\u00e1m Sikandar Jah, is the largest military station in India, and forms the head-quarters of the Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d Subsidiary Force, which constitutes a Division of the Madras army. The military force stationed here in September 1885 consisted of one regiment of European and another of Native Cavalry, one battery of Royal Horse Artillery, three batteries of Royal Artillery (field and garrison), two regiments of British and four of Native Infantry, with two companies of Sappers and Miners. An Ordnance Establishment has charge of the Arsenal, and there is also a large Commissariat Staff. This force is maintained by the British Government, under the terms of a treaty with the Niz\u00e1m dated 21st May 1853, in lieu of certain contingent and auxiliary forces which had been previously raised by the Niz\u00e1m to co-operate with the British army, but had proved inefficient. The cost of the force is\ndefrayed out of the revenues of certain Districts ceded by the Niz\u00e1m under the treaty of May 1853, revised by a second treaty in 1860. (See Haidarabad State.)\n\nUp to the year 1850, the cantonment of Secunder\u00e1b\u00e1d consisted of a line of barracks and huts, extending to a distance of 3 miles from east to west, with the artillery in the front and on the left flank, and the infantry on the right. Since that date, however, the cantonment boundaries have been extended as far as Bolaram, covering a total area of 19 square miles, including many interspersed villages. New double-storied barracks have been erected for the European soldiers; and the quarters for the Native troops, which are situated at some distance, are also comfortably built.\n\nThe country for miles around undulates into hummocks, with outcrops of underlying rock, crossed from east to west by greenstone dikes. East of the cantonment are two large outbursts of granite; in the north-east is a granite hill known as M\u00fal Al\u00ed, and near it another called Kadam Ras\u00fal, from a legend that it bears an impress of Muhammad's foot. Shady trees line the roads of the cantonment, and near the European barracks and Native lines are clusters of date and palmyra palms. Otherwise the face of the country is bare, with but little depth of soil in the elevated parts. Cultivation is carried on in the dips and valleys, in several of which tanks have been constructed. The water-supply from wells is not abundant. Immediately to the south-west of the cantonment is a large artificial reservoir or tank, known as the Husain S\u00e1g\u00e1r, about 3 miles in circumference.\n\nThe parade-ground is of great extent, upon which a force of seven or eight thousand troops can be manoeuvred with ease. To the right are the public rooms. Close by is the cemetery. A little to the left of the rooms is the mud fort or battery containing some heavy pieces of ordnance. A detachment of artillery is stationed in the fort. A short distance from Secunder\u00e1b\u00e1d is the cantonment of Trimalgiri, containing an entrenched camp capable of accommodating all the Europeans in the neighbourhood.\n\nThe Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d Subsidiary Force is not the sole military body in the neighbourhood. Adjoining the Secunder\u00e1b\u00e1d cantonment to the north is the Bol\u00e1ram cantonment, one of the stations of the H\u00e1idar\u00e1b\u00e1d Contingent under the immediate authority of the Niz\u00e1m. The force stationed here consists of one regiment of cavalry, one of infantry, and a battery of artillery. Again, about 5 miles south of Secunder\u00e1b\u00e1d cantonment, are the lines of the Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d Reformed Troops, also belonging to the Niz\u00e1m, comprising artillery, cavalry, and infantry, under the command of a European officer. Altogether, within a space of 10 miles from north to south, about 8000 disciplined soldiers are cantoned.\nBegampett and Bauenpilli are a short distance west of Secunder\u00e1b\u00e1d. The pioneers are stationed at the first place, and a Madras cavalry regiment at the latter. During the Mutiny of 1857, an unsuccessful attempt was made to tamper with the fidelity of the troops at Secunder\u00e1b\u00e1d. An attack on the British Residency was repulsed; and during the troubled times of 1857-58 much good service was rendered by both the Subsidiary Force and the Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d Contingent.\n\nIn the rainy season, especially towards its close, the climate of Secunder\u00e1b\u00e1d is unhealthy, both for Europeans and natives. The rainfall varies greatly; during the thirty-nine years ending 1881 it averaged 27.7 inches. The prevalent diseases are fevers, dysentery, and rheumatism.\n\n**Seebasaugor.** \u2014 District, Sub-division, and town in Assam. \u2014 See SIBSAGAR.\n\n**Segaul\u00ed.** \u2014 Town in Champ\u00e1ran District, Bengal; situated 15 miles from Mot\u00edh\u00e1ri, on the Betti\u00e1 road, in lat. 26\u00b0 46' 41\" N., and long. 84\u00b0 47' 51\" E. A military station, ordinarily occupied by a regiment of Native cavalry. An embankment protects the cantonment from inundation by the Sikhren\u00e1 river, which flows a little distance to the north. In 1857, the main body of the 12th Regiment of Irregular Horse stationed here broke into open mutiny, and murdered their commanding officer; though a detachment did good service during the subsequent operations in Oudh.\u2014(See Sir J. W. Kaye's History of the Sepoy War, vol. iii. pp. 102-107.)\n\n**Segh\u00far (S\u00edg\u00far) Gh\u00e1t.** \u2014 Mountain pass in the N\u00edlgiri Hills District, Madras Presidency, running down the north face of the hills from Mutin\u00e1d to near the village of Segh\u00far. Lat. 11\u00b0 29' to 11\u00b0 31' 40\" N., and long. 76\u00b0 43' 30\" to 76\u00b0 43' 35\" E. The head of the pass is distant from Utakamand nearly five miles. The descent from the crest is about seven miles in length, but a little more than eight miles to the old bungalow at Segh\u00far. About half-way down is the village of Kalhatti, with its picturesque waterfall (170 feet) not far below. The pass, being practicable for laden carts and other wheeled conveyances, was the most frequented of all the N\u00edlgiri gh\u00e1ts. At one time it was the favourite approach to the hills by the visitors from the northern parts of the Presidency and Madras. 'By this pass,' says Pharoah, 'communication is kept up with Bangalore, Madras, and all places to the northward; and the chief bulk of European supplies, heavy baggage, horse gram, rice, etc., comes to the settlement by it. It also affords the means of transit for the teak timber used on the hills in the form of rafters, planks, etc.; the road passes near the forests where the trees are cut.' The corrected spelling is S\u00edg\u00far.\n\n**Sehi.** \u2014 Village in Chh\u00e1ta tahsil, Muttra (Mathur\u00e1) District, North-Western Provinces; situated in lat. 27\u00b0 40' 2\" N., and long. 77\u00b0 41' 13\" E.,\n8 miles south-east of Chh\u00e1ta, and 16 miles north of Muttra city.

Sehore is the head-quarters of the Bhop\u00e1l Political Agency and of the Bhop\u00e1l Battalion, a local corps under the orders of the Government of India. Population (1881) of the town, 5206, namely, Hindus, 3000; Muhammadans, 2045; and 'others,' 161. Of the cantonment, 10,389, namely, males 5666, and females 4723. Hindus number 8055; Muhammadans, 2288; and 'others,' 46. Manufacture of printed muslins. Good b\u00e1z\u00e1r.\n\n**Sehw\u00e1n.** \u2014 Sub-division of Kar\u00e1chi (Kurrachee) District, Sind, Bombay Presidency; lying between 25\u00b0 13' and 26\u00b0 56' N. lat., and between 67\u00b0 10' and 68\u00b0 20' E. long. Area, 5759 square miles. Population (1872) 162,836; (1881) 176,917. Bounded north by Mehar, a Sub-division of Shik\u00e1pur; east by the Indus; south by the Jerruck (Jhirak) Sub-division of Kar\u00e1chi (Kurrachee) District; and west by the Khirthar and Pab Mountains. The administrative head-quarters are at KOTRI TOWN.\n\nThe Sub-division of Sehw\u00e1n differs from the rest of Sind in being more hilly. It contains the only large lake in the Province, viz. the MANCHHAR, which, when fed by the waters of the Indus during the months of flood, attains a length of 20 miles and a breadth of 10 miles, covering a total area estimated at 180 square miles. The chief hills are the LAKI range, an offshoot from the Kirthar mountains; and the Jatil Hills. There are 37 Government canals in Sehw\u00e1n, the principal being the WESTERN NARA, the ARAL, the PHITO, and the KARO. The Sub-division contains several hot springs. Game and fish of all kinds are abundant. The Government forests cover an area of 24,474 acres, and yielded in 1873-74 a revenue of \u00a33185. The population of Sehw\u00e1n in 1881 numbered 176,917, namely, males 96,426, and females 80,491, occupying 32,897 houses, in 6 towns and 210 villages.

The principal antiquities are the forts of SEHWAN and R\u00e1n\u00ed-ka-kot. (See SANN.)\nAgriculture.\u2014The D\u00e1d\u00fa and Sehw\u00e1n taluks contain perhaps the finest wheat lands in the whole of Sind. Much cultivation is carried on in the neighbourhood of the Manchhar Lake, after the subsidence of the annual inundation. The principal crops are wheat, jo\u00e1r (Sorghum vulgare), cotton, barley, pulse, oil-seeds, and vegetables. The prevailing tenure is zam\u00ednd\u00e1ri; about one-twelfth of the whole area is held in j\u00e1gir, or revenue-free. In 1882\u201383, the area assessed to land revenue was 205,392 acres; the area under actual cultivation being 189,200 acres. A large transit trade is carried on in wool, cotton, dried fruits, etc. (See Kar\u00e1chi Town.) The local traffic consists of fish, mats, cloths, oil, gh\u00ed, and grain. The principal manufactures comprise carpets, coarse cotton cloth, rugs, and mats. The aggregate length of roads in the Sub-division is about 450 miles; and the Sind, Punjab, and Delhi (Indus Valley State) Railway passes through its entire length. The number of ferries is 20, nearly all of which are on the Indus.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The total revenue of Sehw\u00e1n Sub-division in 1881\u201382 amounted to \u00a362,871, of which \u00a358,244 was derived from imperial and \u00a34627 from local sources. The land-tax, abk\u00e1ri (excise), and stamp duties formed the main items. Two subordinate civil courts, at Sehw\u00e1n and Kotri. Criminal courts, 12; police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), 39. Total number of police, 360, or 1 constable to every 491 of the population. Number of municipalities, 6, namely, Kotri, Sehw\u00e1n, Johi, Bubak, D\u00e1d\u00fa, and M\u00e1njhand. Aggregate municipal income (1883\u201384), \u00a33093; incidence of taxation varying from 1s. 0\u00bed. to 2s. 7\u00bdd. Subsidiary jails at Kohist\u00e1n and Kotri.

Revenue, \u00a312,232.\n\nSehw\u00e1n.\u2014Chief town of Sehw\u00e1n t\u00e1luk, Kar\u00e1chi (Kurrachee) District, Sind, Bombay Presidency; situated in lat. 26\u00b0 26' N., and long. 67\u00b0 54' E., on the main road from Kotri to Shik\u00e1rpur via L\u00e1rkh\u00e1na, 84 miles north-north-west of Kotri, and 95 miles south-south-west of\nL\u00e1rh\u00e1na; elevation above sea-level, 117 feet. The river Indus, which formerly flowed close to the town, has now quite deserted it. A few miles south of Sehw\u00e1n, the Laki Hills terminate abruptly, forming a characteristic feature of this portion of the Sub-division. Sehw\u00e1n is the head-quarters of a mukhti\u00e1rk\u00e1r and t\u00edpp\u00fad\u00e1r. A station on the Sind, Punjab, and Delhi (Indus Valley State) Railway, with a branch line from the station to the town. Population (1881) 4524. The Muhammadan inhabitants are for the most part engaged in fishing; the Hindus, in trade.\n\nA large section of the people are professional mendicants, supported by the offerings of pilgrims at the shrine of L\u00e1l Sh\u00e1hb\u00e1z. The tomb containing the remains of this saint is enclosed in a quadrangular edifice, covered with a dome and lantern, said to have been built in 1356 A.D., and having beautiful encaustic tiles with Arabic inscriptions. Mirz\u00e1 J\u00e1ni, of the Tarkhan dynasty, built a still larger tomb to this saint, which was completed in 1639 A.D. The gate and balustrade are said to have been of hammered silver, the gift of M\u00edr Karam Ali Kh\u00e1n Talpur, who also crowned the domes with silver spires. The chief object, however, of antiquarian interest in Sehw\u00e1n is the fort, ascribed to Alexander the Great. This is an artificial mound 80 or 90 yards high, measuring round the summit 1500 by 800 feet, and surrounded by a broken wall. The mound is evidently an artificial structure, and the remains of several towers are visible. The fortifications are now in disrepair. Sehw\u00e1n is undoubtedly a place of great antiquity. Tradition asserts that the town was in existence at the time of the first Muhammadan invasion of Sind by Muhammad K\u00e1sim Safiki, about 713 A.D.; and it is believed to be the same place which submitted to his arms after the conquest of Nerankot, the modern Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d.\n\nThe public buildings of Sehw\u00e1n are the Subordinate Civil Court, Government Anglo-veracular school, dispensary, post-office, lock-up, Deputy Collector\u2019s and travellers\u2019 bungalow, and dharm\u015b\u00e1la. Municipal income in 1883\u201384, \u00a3690; incidence of taxation, 2s. 7\u00bdd. per head. The transit trade is mainly in wheat and rice; and the local commerce, in cloth and grain. The manufactures comprise carpets, coarse cloth, and pottery. The art of seal-engraving, which was formerly much practised, is now almost extinct.\n\n**Sejakpur.**\u2014Petty State in the Jh\u00e1l\u00e1w\u00e1r prant or Division of K\u00e1thi\u00e1-w\u00e1r, Bombay Presidency; consisting of 4 villages, with 3 shareholders or tribute-payers.

Bounded on the north by Jabalpur, on the east by Mandl\u00e1 and B\u00e1lg\u00e1h\u00e1t, on the south by B\u00e1lg\u00e1h\u00e1t, N\u00e1gpur, and Bhand\u00e1r\u00e1, and on the west by Narsinghpur and Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1. Area, 3247 square miles. Population (1881) 334,733 souls. The administrative head-quarters are at Seoni Town.\n\n**Physical Aspects.** \u2014 The District of Seoni occupies a portion of the S\u00e1t-pura table-land, which separates the valley of the Narbad\u00e1 (Nerbudda), on the north, from the great plain of N\u00e1gpur, on the south. The greater part of the District consists of the plateaux of Lakhn\u00e1don and Seoni on the north and west, together with the valleys between; and of the watershed and elevated basin of the Waingang\u00e1 river on the east. Almost everywhere the scenery presents the varied aspect of an upland country. Geologically, northern Seoni constitutes a part of the wide field of overflowing trap which occupies the area between the Pachmarh\u00ed hills westward and the Maikal range beyond Mandl\u00e1 to the east. In the south, the formation consists of crystalline rock. Towards the western boundary, the metamorphic rocks, chiefly gneiss and micaceous schist, form the southern face of the hills which bound the Seoni plateau. Northwards, they are lost sight of in the bed of laterite which overlies this part of the plateau, and covers the trap to within a short distance of Seoni town. A few miles east of Seoni, the crystalline rocks again come to the surface; and from this point eastward, the valley of the S\u00e1gar constitutes the line of demarcation between the crystalline rocks and the trap.\n\nThe District is hilly throughout, but the physical features of the geological formations present a marked contrast. In the north the trap hills either take the shape of ridges with straight outlines and flattened tops, or, rising more gradually, expand into wide undulating plateaux. The valleys are wide and bare, and contain the rich black soil formed by disintegrated trap, spread over a deep deposit of calcareous clay; while the intersecting streams, as they cut through the clay, expose broad masses of bare black basalt, alternating with marshy and stagnant pools. In the southern portion of the District, the hills are more\npointed, the valleys more confined, and the soil, even where it is rich, contains a large admixture of sand. Seoni must at one time have abounded with timber. At present the northern hills have much teak, but of an inferior and stunted growth. Along the Waingang\u00e1 a few patches of young teak are found; the vast bamboo forest of Sonawani, in the south-east corner of the District, contains fine bije-s\u00e1l and tend\u00fa; while to the north some large s\u00e1j grows upon the hills. The reserved forests consist of the great firewood reserve for K\u00e1mthi and N\u00e1gpur, covering 315 square miles.\n\nThe chief river of the District is the Waingang\u00e1, which rises a few miles east of the N\u00e1gpur and Jabalpur road, near the Kur\u00e1i Gh\u00e1t; and soon afterwards, turning to the south, forms the boundary between Seoni and B\u00e1lg\u00e1gh\u00e1t Districts. Its affluents are the H\u00edr\u00ed and S\u00e1g\u00e1r on the right bank; the Th\u00e9l\u00ed, Bijn\u00e1, and Th\u00e1nwar on the left. Besides these streams, the Timar and the Sher flow northwards to the Narbad\u00e1; and on the west, the Pench for some distance separates Seoni from Chhindwar\u00e1. The N\u00e1gpur and Jabalpur road crosses the Sher at Son\u00e1i Dongr\u00ed, where a fine stone bridge spans the river. The general slope of the country is from east to west. The elevation of the Seoni and Lakhn\u00e1don plateaux varies from 1800 to 2200 feet above sea-level.\n\nIron is found at several places in Seoni District, but is only worked at J\u00fat\u00e1ma near Pip\u00e1w\u00e1n\u00ed, as since the introduction of the system of Forest Conservancy, charcoal cannot be obtained at a sufficiently low rate. Gold is found in many of the smaller streams and their affluents, and is occasionally washed for by an aboriginal tribe called Mundi\u00e1s, or locally in Seoni District, Songiri\u00e1s.\n\nHistory.\u2014About the 5th century of our era, a dynasty of conquerors appears to have reigned on the S\u00e1tpura table-land. Some grants of territory inscribed on copper plates found in Seoni, an inscription in the Zodiac cave at Ajant\u00e1, and a few passages in the Pur\u00e1nas, dimly disclose a line of princes sprung from one Vindhya-sakti. This mythical hero seems to be the eponymous monarch of the Vindhyan Hills, in which designation the Pur\u00e1nas include the S\u00e1tpura range. But the history proper of Seoni begins with the reign of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Sangr\u00e1m S\u00e1 of Garha-Mandl\u00e1, who, in 1530, extended his dominion over fifty-two chiefships, three of which\u2014Ghansor, Chaur\u00ed, and Dongart\u00e1l\u2014form the greater part of the present District. Nearly two centuries later, Narendra S\u00e1, the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Mandl\u00e1, conferred these tracts on Bakht Buland, the famous prince of Deogarh, in acknowledgment of his assistance in suppressing a revolt. Bakht Buland placed his kinsman R\u00e1j\u00e1 R\u00e1m Singh in possession of the Seoni country; and the latter built a fort at Chhapar\u00e1 and established his headquarters in that town. Soon afterwards, Bakht Buland made a progress through the District, and chanced to make the acquaintance of T\u00e1j\nKh\u00e1n, a Muhammadan adventurer. The bravery of T\u00e1j Kh\u00e1n in killing a bear single-handed first attracted the attention and won the favour of the Deogarh monarch; and it was at the instigation, and in the name of Bakht Buland, that T\u00e1j Kh\u00e1n attacked and took S\u00e1ngarh\u00ed in Bhand\u00e1ra District.\n\nIn 1743, Raghuji, the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 R\u00e1j\u00e1 of N\u00e1gpur, finally overthrew the dynasty of Deogarh; but Muhammad Kh\u00e1n, who had succeeded his father, T\u00e1j Kh\u00e1n, at S\u00e1ngarh\u00ed, refused to recognise the conqueror, and held out against the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s for three years. Admiring his conduct, Raghuji offered him Seoni District if he would give up S\u00e1ngarh\u00ed. Muhammad Kh\u00e1n consented; and repaired to Chhapar\u00e1, whence he governed Seoni, with the title of D\u00edw\u00e1n. One serious reverse chequered a fortunate and successful reign when, during the absence of Muhammad Kh\u00e1n at N\u00e1gpur, the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Mandl\u00e1 attacked and captured Chhapar\u00e1. The square tomb which still stands in the ruined fort covers the large pit in which all those slain in the assault were buried. The D\u00edw\u00e1n, however, speedily advanced from N\u00e1gpur with a large force, and recovered his capital; and the Th\u00e1nwar and Gang\u00e1 rivers were again declared to be the boundaries between Seoni and the Mandl\u00e1 kingdom.\n\nMaj\u00edd Kh\u00e1n, the eldest son of Muhammad Kh\u00e1n, succeeded in 1761; and was followed in 1774 by his son Muhammad Am\u00edn Kh\u00e1n, who removed his head-quarters to Seoni, where he built the present family residence. After a prosperous reign of twenty-four years, he was succeeded by his eldest son, Muhammad Zam\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n. The weakness of the new ruler proved disastrous both to the country and the dynasty. Chhapar\u00e1, which, though no longer the capital, was still a large and flourishing city, with a population, it is said, of 40,000, was sacked and utterly ruined by the Pind\u00e1r\u00eds; and soon afterwards, perceiving the incompetence of the D\u00edw\u00e1n, and anxious to compensate by fresh acquisitions for their cession of Berar to the British in 1804, the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s ejected Muhammad Zam\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n. Raghuji then sold the government of the District for \u00a330,000 per annum to Kharak Bh\u00e1rti, a Gos\u00e1in. Eventually, with the downfall of the N\u00e1gpur power, Seoni came under British rule, and since then has remained undisturbed. The District contains but few architectural remains. At Umargarh, Bhains\u00e1garh, Part\u00e1pgarh, and Kanh\u00e1garh, all situated on commanding spots along the southern margin of the S\u00e1tpuras, stand ruined forts attributed by tradition to the Bundel\u00e1 R\u00e1j\u00e1s. Of these, the Bhains\u00e1garh fort is in the least imperfect condition. Two old Gond forts also remain,\u2014one in the Sonw\u00e1r\u00e1 forest, near Ashta; the other near Ugl\u00ed, on a well-nigh inaccessible rock in the bed of the Hiri river. At Ghansor, 20 miles north-east of Seoni town, the ruins of about 40 temples seem to indicate the former existence of a large town. Some\nof the plinths are still in their place, and are attributed to a caste of Hindus from the Deccan called Hem\u00e1ranthis.\n\nPopulation.\u2014A rough enumeration in 1866 returned the population of Seoni at 421,750, but on a much larger area than the present District. The Census of 1872 disclosed a population, in the District as at present constituted, of 300,558. The last Census in 1881 returned a total of 334,733 inhabitants, showing an increase of 34,175, or 11.37 per cent., in nine years, of which 9.6 per cent. represents the natural increase of registered births over registered deaths, and the remainder the gain by immigration from neighbouring Districts.\n\nThe results of the Census of 1881 may be summarized as follows:\u2014\n\nArea of District, 3247 square miles, with 1 town and 1462 villages. Number of houses, 72,349, namely, 67,104 occupied, and 5245 unoccupied. Total population, 334,733, namely, males 167,925, and females 166,808.

Of the 1462 villages, 866 contain less than two hundred inhabitants; 495 between two and five hundred; 89 between five hundred and a thousand; and 12 between one thousand and three thousand. As regards occupation,\nthe Census divides the male population into the following six classes:\u2014\n(1) Professional class, including civil and military, 7320; (2) domestic\nclass, 1009; (3) commercial class, including merchants, traders,\ncarriers, etc., 1830; (4) agricultural and pastoral class, including\ngardeners, 83,536; (5) manufacturing and industrial class, including\nartisans, 17,378; (6) indefinite and non-productive class, comprising\ngeneral labourers and male children, 60,452.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Of the total area of 3247 square miles, only 1098\nsquare miles were cultivated in 1883\u201384; and of the portion lying waste,\n613 square miles were returned as cultivable, and 1536 square miles as\nuncultivable waste. The total area assessed for Government revenue is\n2276 square miles, of which 984 square miles are cultivated, 596\nsquare miles are cultivable, and 696 square miles are uncultivable\nwaste. Wheat forms the chief crop of the District, and is grown year\nafter year on the rich black soil of the plateaux in the north and west.\nIn 1883\u201384, it occupied 265,913 acres; while 388,217 acres were\ndevoted to other food-grains. The rice land of the District lies in the\nsouth. In 1883, rice was grown on 169,185 acres. Other products\nwere\u2014sugar-cane, 778 acres; cotton, 6594 acres; and other fibres,\n2214 acres. The k\u00e1sa grass, which yields an oil like the cajep\u00e1t, and\nthe baher\u00e1 (Terminalia bellerica), harr\u00e1 (Terminalia chebula), and\nmanjit (Rubia munjeesta), plants which supply valuable dyes, abound\nin the District.

The ordinary prices of produce per cwt. were as\nfollows:\u2014Wheat, 4s. 1d.; rice, 6s. 10d.; sugar (s\u00far), 12s. 3d.; cotton\n(cleaned), 45s. 6d. Wages averaged, for skilled labour, 1s.; for unskilled labour, 3\u00bdd. per diem.\n\nCommerce and Trade.\u2014The trade of the District is chiefly carried on by means of markets in the towns. The most important are those held at Burgh\u00e1t, Kor\u00e1i, and Piparw\u00e1ni, to which the grain of the rice-producing tract in the south is brought for export to N\u00e1gpur and K\u00e1mthi (Kamptee). Three annual fairs take place in the District\u2014namely, at Mund\u00e1ra, close to Seoni town at the source of the Waingang\u00e1, at Sur\u00e1ikha at the junction of the H\u00edr\u00ed and Waingang\u00e1, and at Chhap\u00e1r\u00e1. The first two are primarily religious gatherings, but a large business is done in general merchandise, by traders from Seoni, Mandl\u00e1, Jabalpur, and N\u00e1gpur. The last is a cattle fair, at which some 70,000 head of cattle change hands annually. The imports and exports are both insignificant, but the through traffic between N\u00e1gpur and Bhandar\u00e1 and the north causes some degree of business. The manufactures consist of coarse cloth, and some pottery of superior quality made at K\u00e1nh\u00edw\u00e1r\u00e1. At Khaw\u00e1sa, in the midst of the forest, leather is beautifully tanned. The chief line of communication is the high-road from N\u00e1gpur to Jabalpur, which enters the District near Khaw\u00e1sa, and, passing by Seoni town, crosses the border into Jabalpur District near Dh\u00fam\u00e1. It has travellers\u2019 bungalows at Kur\u00e1i, Chhap\u00e1r\u00e1, and Dh\u00fam\u00e1. A District road with American platform bridges runs from Seoni through Katangi, to join the Great Eastern Road. The other lines consist of mere bullock tracks, leading to various points in B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t and N\u00e1gpur Districts. Seoni has no means of communication by water or by rail.\n\nAdministration.\u2014In 1861, Seoni was formed into a separate District of the British Government of the Central Provinces. It is administered by a Deputy Commissioner, with Assistants and tahsild\u00e1rs. Total revenue in 1876\u201377, \u00a325,567; and in 1883\u201384, \u00a335,419, of which \u00a315,379 was derived from the land-tax. Total cost of District officials and police of all kinds (1883\u201384), \u00a37547. Number of civil and revenue judges of all sorts within the District, 6; magistrates, 5. Maximum distance from any village to the nearest court, 45 miles; average distance, 24 miles. Number of regular and town police, 317 men, costing \u00a34621, being 1 policeman to about every 10\u00b734 square miles and to every 1066 inhabitants. The daily average number of convicts in jail in 1883 was 72, of whom 6 were females. The total cost of the jails in that year was \u00a3473. The number of Government or aided schools in the District under Government inspection was 39, attended by 2255 pupils. The Census Report of 1881 returned 1896 boys and 218 girls as under instruction, besides 3247 males and 126 females able to read and write, but not under instruction.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The plateaux enjoy a moderate and healthy climate.\nThe average mean temperature at Seoni town for a period of ten years ending 1881 was returned at 74\u00b04' F., the average monthly means being as follows:\u2014January, 63\u00b06'; February, 68\u00b06'; March, 76\u00b09'; April, 84\u00b01'; May, 87\u00b06'; June, 82\u00b07'; July, 76\u00b03'; August, 75\u00b06'; September, 76\u00b00'; October, 72\u00b06'; November, 66\u00b03'; December, 62\u00b09'. In May 1883, the maximum temperature registered was 111\u00b02', and the minimum 67\u00b07'; July, maximum 88\u00b09', minimum 68\u00b00'; December, maximum 80\u00b08', minimum 41\u00b07'.

In 1883, 59\u00b09 inches of rain fell, or 10 inches beyond the average, the excess being solely in the monsoon months, June to September. The prevailing disease is fever, which proves most dangerous during the months succeeding the rains. In 1883, two charitable dispensaries, at Seoni and Lakhnadon, afforded medical relief to 17,865 in-door and out-door patients. The number of registered deaths in 1883 was 9183, equal to a death-rate of 28\u00b043 per thousand, of which 22\u00b062 per thousand were assigned to fever. The average death-rate for the previous five years is returned at 32\u00b013 per thousand.

A detachment of British troops from Hoshangabad took the fort in 1818. Seoni is perhaps the chief mercantile town in the whole Narbad\u00e1 (Nerbudda) valley, being the entrepot from which\nthe cotton of Bhop\u00e1l and Narsinghpur, as well as of Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d, is exported to Bombay. Grain is the other export. Imports\u2014English cotton fabrics, spices, and metals. The Great Indian Peninsula Railway has a station at Seoni, and a sard\u00ed (native inn) has been built.\n\n**Seoniband.**\u2014Artificial lake in Bhand\u00e1r\u00e1 District, Central Provinces; situated in lat. 21\u00b0 N., and long. 80\u00b0 2' E., 8 miles north-west of the Naweg\u00e1o tank; about 8 miles in circumference; average depth, 30 feet; length of embankment, 630 feet.

'In 1816, when garrisoned by Sindhia's general, Baptiste, with 200 men, it was surprised and taken by escalade by the celebrated R\u00e1jput chief Jai Singh, who had only 60 men. The captor seized a large amount of treasure, and made the family of Baptiste prisoners.'\n\n**Seor\u00e1j.**\u2014Tract of country in K\u00e1ngra District, Punjab; forming part of the K\u00falu Sub-division, and lying between 31\u00b0 20' 30\" and 31\u00b0 54' 30\" N. lat., and between 77\u00b0 14' and 77\u00b0 43' E. long.

The greater part of the surface is covered with forests of deodar and other trees; but the narrow river valleys present occasional patches of careful cultivation, interspersed with picturesque villages of wooden houses, often highly carved in a rough but effective style, and resembling Swiss ch\u00e2lets. Most of the cultivation, however, is conducted on the hill-sides. The custom of polyandry is prevalent.\n\n**Seorha.**\u2014Town in Datia State, Bundelkhand, Central India Agency; situated 36 miles east of Mor\u00e1r, and 40 miles north-east of Datia town.

The municipality includes several neighbouring hamlets; 41 metalled and 36 unmetalled roads run through the town. Serampur was formerly a Danish settlement, and remained so until 1845, when all the Danish possessions in India were ceded by treaty to the East India Company on payment of \u00a3125,000. Station on the East Indian Railway, 13 miles distant from Calcutta (Howrah station). Serampur is historically famous as the scene of the labours of the Baptist missionaries, Carey, Marshman, and Ward; the mission still flourishes, and its founders have established a church, school, college, and noble library in connection with it; there is also a dispensary here. The Friend of India, a weekly paper formerly published at Serampur, but now at Calcutta, once rendered this town conspicuous in the history of Indian journalism. Chief manufactures, paper and mats.\n\nSergada.\u2014Zam\u012bnd\u0101r\u012b estate in Ganj\u0101m District, Madras Presidency. Area, 25 square miles.

Since the rendition of Mysore State, later municipal statistics are not available.\n\nHistory.\u2014The name is derived from Sri Ranga, one of the forms of the god Vishnu, who is worshipped by the same title on two other islands lower down the K\u0101veri, Sivasamudram and Srirangam; but his temple here takes first rank of the three, as Adi Ranga. Local\nlegend relates that Gautama Buddha himself worshipped at this shrine. According to a Tamil ms., preserved in the Mackenzie collection, the site had become overgrown with jungle, and the temple was rebuilt in 894 A.D., during the reign of the last Gang\u00e1 sovereign. In 1133, the Vishnuite apostle R\u00e1m\u00e1nuja received a grant of the island, with the surrounding country, from a king of the Ball\u00e1l\u00e1 dynasty. The fort is said to have been founded in 1454 by a descendant of one of the local officers or hebbars appointed by R\u00e1m\u00e1nuja. Seringapatam first appears in authentic history as the capital of the viceroys of the distant Hindu emperors of Vijayanagar, who took the title of Sri-ranga-r\u00e1yal. Tirumala, the last of these viceroys, surrendered in 1610 to R\u00e1j\u00e1 Wodeyar, the representative of the rising house of Mysore. Henceforth Seringapatam remained the seat of Government until the downfall of Tip\u00fa Sult\u00e1n in 1799.\n\nThe existing fortifications were almost entirely constructed by Tip\u00fa, who thrice sustained a siege from British armies. In 1791, Lord Cornwallis, the Governor-General, commanding in person, advanced up to the walls, but was compelled to retire through want of provisions. In the following year he won a decisive victory in the field, and had invested the city on all sides, when Tip\u00fa purchased peace by the cession of half his dominions. Finally, in 1799, the fort was stormed by General Harris, and Tip\u00fa fell in the breach. The siege was begun in April of that year with a powerful battering train, and the assault was delivered after a bombardment of nearly one month's duration. The spot selected for breaching was in the wall facing the K\u00e1veri, for the defences were weakest on that side, and the river was at that season of the year easily fordable. After the capture, the island of Seringapatam was ceded to the British Government, who leased it to the State of Mysore for an annual rent of \u00a35000; at the rendition of Mysore State in 1881, it was made over free.\n\nWhen the residence of the restored R\u00e1j\u00e1 was removed to Mysore city in 1800, Seringapatam immediately fell into decay. Dr. Buchanan-Hamilton, who visited the place in 1800, returned the population at 31,895 souls, as compared with 150,000 when Tip\u00fa Sult\u00e1n was at the height of his power. An outbreak of epidemic fever accompanied this depopulation; and in 1811, the British military head-quarters were removed to Bangalore. At the present day, the ruins of Seringapatam are almost deserted; and the place bears such a bad name for malaria, that no European traveller dare sleep on the island. The natives attribute this change of climate to the destruction of the sweet flag, a plant to which they assign extraordinary virtue as a febrifuge. The suburb of Ganjam, said to have been colonized by Tip\u00fa with the deported inhabitants of Sira, is a fairly prosperous place, and crowded fairs are held three times in the year.\nGeneral Description.\u2014The island of Seringapatam is about 3 miles in length from east to west, and 1 mile in breadth. The fort stands at its upper or western end, immediately overhanging the river. The plan is that of an irregular pentagon, with an extreme diameter of 1\u00bd mile. The defences, which were laid out by Tip\u00fa himself, are imposing for their massiveness, though not constructed on scientific principles. They consist of wall piled upon wall, and cavalier behind cavalier, the chief characteristic being the deep ditches cut through the solid granite. The whole remains in almost precisely the same condition as it was left after the siege, even to the breaches, except that a luxuriant growth of trees has been allowed to spring up.\n\nThe spot where the English batteries were planted is now marked by two cannons stuck upright in the ground. Inside the fort are the ruins of Tip\u00fa\u2019s palace, now partly occupied as a storehouse for sandalwood; the old temple of R\u00e1nga-n\u00e1tha-sw\u00e1mi; the Jam\u00e1 Masjid, a tall mosque with two minarets, built by Tip\u00fa shortly before his death; and a few traces of the palace of the early Hindu rulers. Just outside the walls is the Dariya Daulat B\u00e1gh, or \u2018garden of the wealth of the sea,\u2019 a building (now falling to decay) of graceful proportions, handsomely decorated with arabesque work in rich colours. It was erected by Tip\u00fa for a summer retreat, and contains the celebrated pictures representing the defeat of Baillie at Conjevaram in 178c, which, after being twice defaced, were finally restored by the express orders of Lord Dalhousie when Governor-General.\n\nAt the eastern or lower end of the island, near the suburb of Ganj\u00e1m, is the L\u00e1l B\u00e1gh or \u2018red garden,\u2019 containing the mausoleum built by Tip\u00fa Sult\u00e1n for his father Haidar Al\u00ed, in which he himself lies, by his father\u2019s side. This is a square building, with dome and minarets, surrounded by a corridor which is supported by pillars of black hornblende. The double doors, inlaid with ivory, were the gift of Lord Dalhousie. The inscription on the tombstone of Tip\u00fa relates how he died a martyr to Isl\u00e1m, and at the same time indicates by the initial letters the date of his death. Each of the two tombs is covered with a crimson pall, and the expenses of the place are defrayed by Government. The island of Seringapatam yields valuable crops of rice and sugar-cane, which are watered from a canal originally constructed by Tip\u00fa, and brought across from the mainland by an aqueduct.\n\nSeringham.\u2014Town and famous temple in Trichinopoli District, Madras Presidency.\u2014See Srirangam.\n\nSesa.\u2014River in the south of Lakhimpur District, Assam, which rises in a marsh near the village of B\u00e1jaltali, and, flowing south-west in a very circuitous course, empties itself into the Buri Dihing near its junction with the Brahmaputra. During the rainy season, the Sesa is navigable by canoes for a considerable distance.\nSesh\u00e1chalam.\u2014Hill range in Cuddapah (Kadap\u00e1) District, Madras Presidency; an offshoot of the P\u00e1lkonda Hills, skirting the east and north-east of the District. Lat. $14^\\circ 12'$ to $14^\\circ 35'$ N., long. $78^\\circ 1' 30''$ to $78^\\circ 56'$ E. The hills are uniform in appearance, and rise from 1200 to 1800 feet above the level of the sea. There are no isolated peaks. The Sesh\u00e1chalam Hills strike off in a westerly direction from the P\u00e1lkonda range at a point about 15 miles south of the Penner (Ponnaiy\u00e1r) river. In some parts they are clothed with rich forests, and the scenery is very beautiful.\u2014See also PALKONDA.\n\nSettipattadai (or Tiruv\u00e1di, Triv\u00e1di).\u2014Town in Cuddalore t\u00e1luk, South Arcot District, Madras Presidency. Lat. $11^\\circ 46'$ N., long. $79^\\circ 36' 35''$ E., 15 miles west of Fort St. David. Population (1881) 4566, namely, Hindus, 4273; Muhammadans, 284; and Christians, 9. Number of houses, 569. Except as the seat of a sub-magistrate, Settipattadai is now of no importance; but it was the scene of frequent fighting during the Karn\u00e1tik wars of the last century. The French occupied it in 1850; Lawrence captured it in 1752. In the following year it was three times attacked by the French; the third time successfully. In 1760, it again fell into the hands of the English.\n\nSett\u00far.\u2014Town in Srivillipatur t\u00e1luk, Tinnevell\u00ed District, Madras Presidency. Lat. $9^\\circ 26'$ N., long. $77^\\circ 31' 20''$ E. Population (1881) 6443, occupying 1449 houses. Hindus number 6300; Muhammadans, 90; and Christians, 53. The zam\u00edn\u00e9d\u00e1r is of the Maravar caste, and is descended from an old p\u00e1leg\u00e1r family, who ruled Tinnevelli as feudal chiefs dependent on the Madura kingdom. The estate is situated at the south-west corner of Srivillipatur t\u00e1luk. It is well irrigated from the mountains, a portion of which, including fine forests, is claimed by the zam\u00edn\u00e9d\u00e1r. The area and population of the estate are not returned separately in the Census Report of 1881. The zam\u00edn\u00e9d\u00e1r pays annually a peshkash or fixed revenue of \u00a31254. The rental amounts to \u00a33624.\n\nSeven Pagod\u00e1s.\u2014Town in Chengalpat (Chingleput) District, Madras Presidency.\u2014See MAHABALIPUR.\n\nSeveri (Seberi).\u2014River in Madras Presidency.\u2014See SABARI.\n\nSew\u00e1n.\u2014Sub-division of S\u00e1ran District, Bengal. Area, 853 square miles, with 1 town and 1460 villages; number of houses, 121,204, of which 104,848 are occupied and 16,356 unoccupied. Total population (1881) 749,482, namely, males 359,734, and females 389,478; proportion of males, 48 per cent. Hindus number 642,927; Muhammadans, 106,438; and \u2018others,\u2019 117. Number of inhabitants per square mile, 878; villages per square mile, 171; persons per village, 513; houses per square mile, 142; inmates per house, 7. This Sub-division consists of the 3 police circles of Sew\u00e1n, Daraul\u00ed, and Basantpur. It contained in 1884, 1 civil and 2 criminal\ncourts, a regular police force of 92 men, and 1805 village watchmen.\n\n**Sew\u00e1n.**\u2014Town in S\u00e1ran District, Bengal.\u2014See Aliganj Sewan.\n\n**Sew\u00e1n (Siwan).**\u2014Town in Kaithal tahsil, Karn\u00e1l District, Punjab; situated in lat. 29\u00b0 42' N., and long. 76\u00b0 25' E., about 6 miles west of Kaithal town. Population (1881) 5717, namely, Hindus, 3252; Muhammadans, 2454; and Sikhs, 11. Number of houses, 287. The town itself is an unpretentious collection of native houses, without any building of importance. Its lands include an enormous hollow in which rice is extensively grown with the aid of the floodwaters of the Saraswat\u00ed. On the stream is an old Mughal bridge and an abandoned village site of great size, where ancient bricks and Indo-Scythian coins are found in considerable numbers. This site is locally known as Teh Polar.\n\n**Sew\u00e1n\u00ed.**\u2014Town in Hiss\u00e1r tahsil, Hiss\u00e1r District, Punjab; distant from Hiss\u00e1r town 21 miles south. Population (1881) 3694, chiefly Muhammadan R\u00e1jputs, many of whom enjoy the title of R\u00e1o. Thriving and prosperous town, said to have escaped unhurt from the periodical famines which ravage the dry surrounding tract.\n\n**Shabkadar (Shankargarh).**\u2014Town and fort in Do\u00e1b\u00e1-D\u00e1\u00fadzai tahsil, Pesh\u00e1war District, Punjab; situated in lat. 34\u00b0 10' 30\" N., and long. 71\u00b0 33' E., about 3 miles from the foot of the western hills, and 17 miles north-east of Pesh\u00e1war city. The village is the seat of one of the chief Gigi\u00e1ni families in the Do\u00e1b\u00e1, and contains a number of wealthy traders. The village sprung up around the fort of Shankargarh, built by the Sikhs on a mound about a mile north of the village. The fort is now strongly fortified, and garrisoned by a force under the command of a field officer. In the centre of the fort is a high bastion called the cavalier, which commands an extensive view of the surrounding country. The garrison consists of infantry and cavalry, who are relieved from Naushahra. The fort and village contains (1881) a total population of 1367, namely, Muhammadans, 667; Hindus, 663; Sikhs, 29; and Christians, 8. Municipal income (1881), \u00a3188. Dispensary and police station.\n\n**Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d.**\u2014British District in the Lieutenant-Governorship of Bengal, lying between 24\u00b0 31' and 25\u00b0 43' N. lat., and between 83\u00b0 23' and 84\u00b0 55' E. long. Area, 4365 square miles. Population, according to the Census of 1881, 1,964,909 souls. Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d forms the south-western portion of the Patn\u00e1 Division. It is bounded on the north by the District of Gh\u00e1z\u00edpur in the North-Western Provinces, and the Bengal District of S\u00e1ran; on the east by Patn\u00e1 and Gay\u00e1 Districts; on the south by Loh\u00e1rdag\u00e1; and on the west by the Districts of M\u00edrz\u00e1pur, Benares, and Gh\u00e1z\u00edpur, in the North-Western Provinces. On the north and east, the boundary is marked by the Ganges and Son (Soane)\nrivers, which unite in the north-eastern corner of the District. Similarly, the Karamn\u00e1sa forms the boundary with the North-Western Provinces on the west, from its source to its junction with the Ganges near Chaus\u00e1; and the Son is the boundary with Loh\u00e1rdag\u00e1 on the south. The administrative head-quarters are at the town of Arrah.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d naturally divides into two distinct regions, differing in climate, scenery, and productions. The northern portion, comprising about three-fourths of the whole area, presents the ordinary flat appearance common to the valley of the Ganges in the Province of Behar; but it has a barer aspect than the trans-Gangetic Districts of S\u00e1ran, Darbhanga, and Muzaffarpur. This tract is entirely under cultivation, and is dotted over with clumps of trees\u2014mangoes, mahu\u00e1, bamboos, palms, etc. The southern portion of the District is occupied by the K\u00e1imur hills, a branch of the great Vindhyan range. The area of these hills situated within Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d is 799 square miles. The boundaries of the hills, though well defined, are very irregular, and often indented by deep gorges scoured out by the hill streams. The edges are generally very precipitous, and huge masses of rocks which have fallen from the top obstruct in many places the river channels below. The summit of the hills consists of a series of saucer-shaped valleys, each a few miles in diameter, with a deposit of rich vegetable mould in the centre, on which the finest crops are produced. There are several gh\u00e1ts or ascents to the top, some of which are practicable for beasts of burden. Two of the most frequented of these passes are Sark\u00ed and Khariy\u00e1ri\u2014the first near the south-western boundary, the second in a deep gorge north of Roht\u00e1s. Two passes on the north side are more accessible,\u2014one, known as the Khul\u00e1 gh\u00e1t, is 2 miles south of S\u00e1sser\u00e1m; the other is at Chhanpathar, at the extreme west of the District, where the Karamn\u00e1sa forms a waterfall. The slopes to the south are covered with bamboo, while those on the north are overgrown with a mixed growth of stunted jungle. The general height of the plateau is 1500 feet above the level of the sea.\n\nThe Son and the Ganges may be called the chief rivers of Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d, although neither of them anywhere crosses the boundary. The District occupies the angle formed by the junction of these two rivers, and is watered by several minor streams, all of which rise among the K\u00e1imur hills and flow north towards the Ganges. The most noteworthy of these are the following:\u2014The Karamn\u00e1sa, the accursed stream of Hindu mythology, rises on the eastern ridge of the K\u00e1imur plateau, and flows north-west, crossing into M\u00edrz\u00e1pur District near Kulhu\u00e1. After a course of 15 miles in that District, it again touches Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d, which it separates from Benares; finally it falls into the Ganges near Chaus\u00e1. The Dhob\u00e1 or K\u00e1o rises on the plateau, and flowing north, forms a fine waterfall, and enters the plains at the Tarrach\u00e1nd\u00ed Pass, 2\nmiles south-east of S\u00e1sser\u00e1m. Here it bifurcates\u2014one branch, the Kudra, turning to the west, and ultimately joining the Karamn\u00e1sa; while the other, preserving the name of K\u00e1o, flows north and falls into the Ganges near G\u00e1igh\u00e1t. The Dargaut\u00e9 rises on the southern ridge of the plateau, and after flowing north for 9 miles, rushes over a precipice 300 feet high, into the deep glen of Kadhar Kho; eventually it joins the Karamn\u00e1sa, passing on its way the stalactite caves of Gupta and the hill-fortress of Shergarh. This river contains water all the year round; and during the rains, boats of 1\u00bd ton burthen can sail up stream 50 or 60 miles from its mouth. The chief tributaries of the Dargaut\u00e9 are the S\u00far\u00e1, Kor\u00e1, Gonhu\u00e1, and Kudra.\n\nNo system of forest conservancy prevails, and the forests have consequently been denuded of their best timber, more especially on the slopes of the hills. With the exception of the Government estate of B\u00e1nskati, these jungle tracts are the property of the hill zam\u00ednd\u00e1rs, who derive a revenue from them from the sale of wood, and a grazing tax. Large herds of cattle are annually driven up the hills in charge of Ahirs to graze on the upland pasturage. Each animal pays a tax of 4 \u00e1nn\u00e1s (6d.) for the season. Stick-lac is collected by the Kh\u00e1rw\u00e1rs in the jungles, worked up locally into bracelets, and is also used as a dye.\n\nMinerals.\u2014Kankar, or nodular limestone, is found in most parts of the plains, especially in the beds of rivers and along the banks of the Son. Where the nodules are large, it is used as a road metal; but where small, it is generally burnt for lime. The K\u00e1imur hills consist almost entirely of red sandstone, overlying fossiliferous limestone. The former is largely used in building, for which, on account of its durability, it is admirably adapted. As instances of this quality, it may be mentioned that the works erected of this stone by Sher Sh\u00e1h and his family, now more than three centuries old, show not the slightest traces of decay; and there are inscriptions nine hundred years old, equally unaffected. Sandstone is largely quarried by the Irrigation Department, and by private individuals for sugar-mills, millstones, curry-stones, and potters\u2019 wheels. Limestone is found in large quantities at the bottom of the precipices which surround the table-land and its detached ridges, in the deep glens behind Shergarh, and in the bed of the Karamn\u00e1sa. The lime-burners pay a royalty to the zam\u00ednd\u00e1rs of Rs. 2 for every 100 maunds quarried. Alum, slate, and martial pyrites are also found, producing an impure sulphate of iron, but the deposits are nowhere worked.\n\nWild Animals.\u2014In the hilly southern portion of the District, large game abounds. Tigers, bears, and leopards are common; five or six varieties of deer are found; and among the other animals met with are the wild boar, jackal, hy\u00e6na, and fox. The nilg\u00e1ti (blue cow), the Antelope picta of naturalists, is seen on the K\u00e1imur table-land. Of\ngame birds, the barred-headed goose (Anser indicus) is common. The black-backed goose (Sarkidornis melanotus) and the grey goose (A. cinereus) are also to be found. The former is very rare in Lower Bengal, and the latter is seldom seen south of Central India, though it is a common visitor in the north. The other game birds of the District include many varieties of wild duck (the most remarkable being the sheldrake), several kinds of teal, partridges, curlews, and pea-fowl, jungle-fowl, snipe, and golden and common plovers.\n\nThe Son Canals.\u2014The project of irrigating Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d District by a comprehensive scheme of canals, which should also be navigable, dates from 1855, when Colonel Dickens proposed the construction of canals from Patn\u00e1 westwards to Chan\u00e1r, a project subsequently extended to Monghyr in the one direction and to M\u00edrz\u00e1pur in the other. It was, however, finally decided in 1871 that the original scheme should not be extended, and it is still an open question whether the Main Western Canal shall be extended even as far as Chan\u00e1r. The work was commenced in 1869 by the construction of an anicut or weir at Dehr\u00ed-on-Son, about half a mile south of the causeway which carries the Grand Trunk Road from B\u00e1r\u00fan to Dehr\u00ed. This weir is 12,500 feet long by 120 broad, and 8 feet above the normal level of the river bed. It constitutes the head-work of the system. The Main Western Canal, starting from here, has to carry up to the fifth mile, where the Arrah Canal branches off in a north-westerly direction, 4511 cubic feet of water per second, to irrigate 1,200,000 acres, only 600,000 of which require simultaneous irrigation. The Arrah Canal takes off 1616 cubic feet of water per second, which leaves 2895 cubic feet up to the 12th mile, where the Bax\u00e1r and Chausa Canals branch off in a northerly direction, abstracting a further quantity of 1260 cubic feet per second. In aligning the Main Western Canal, the great object was to escape a heavy cutting 30 feet deep at Dehr\u00ed, and carry the water along the ridges of the country. It curves round in a northerly direction to the head-works of the Arrah Canal, then bends to the west, crossing the K\u00e1o by means of a siphon aqueduct at Bihiy\u00e1, and finally stops on the Grand Trunk Road 2 miles west of S\u00e1sser\u00e1m. The distance from Dehr\u00ed to this point is 21\u00bd miles. The length of the Arrah Canal is 60 miles from Dehr\u00ed to the point where it enters the Gang\u00ed nadi, by which it communicates (a farther distance of 10 miles) with the Ganges. With its two branches, the Bihiya and Dumraon Canals, the Arrah Canal commands an area of 441,500 acres. The Bihiy\u00e1 Canal, 30\u00bd miles long, has 7 distributaries; and the Dumr\u00e1on branch, 40\u00bd miles long, has 12. The Arrah Canal has, in addition to these two branches, 4 principal distributaries. The total length of the Bax\u00e1r and Chausa branches is 85 miles, and they command with their distributaries the country between the K\u00e1o and the Dun\u00e1\u00fat\u00ed on the west, a tract which\ngreatly needs irrigation. As a rule, the canals run in such a way that they do not cross the natural drainage channels of the country; but where this is not so, siphons have been provided which allow the water to pass under the canal unhindered. Many of the works being still incomplete, it is not possible to give at present a trustworthy estimate of the total cost of the work. There can be little doubt that these canals have conferred upon Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d entire immunity from future famines.\n\nAs far as the Son readings have gone, they show that a minimum supply of 3000 cubic feet of water per second can be depended upon up to the 15th of January; and this would suffice to irrigate 480,000 acres. But many of the cold-weather crops will have been completely irrigated before this date, so that the amount of water required decreases equally with the volume of the stream. Thus, peas, which occupy a very large area, generally receive their last watering about Christmas, when the supply is 3500 cubic feet per second. Generally speaking, three waterings are required for the cold-weather crops\u2014one early in November, one in December, and one in the middle of January. After February, the supply of water decreases very rapidly; and though in exceptional years of high flood, irrigation might be carried on up to March and April for sugar-cane and indigo, these crops can only be occasionally watered or drenched in an ordinary year.\n\nPopulation.\u2014Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d was one of the Districts statistically surveyed in the beginning of the present century by Dr. Buchanan-Hamilton, who made the area 4087 square miles, and the population 1,419,520. According to a later estimate, based upon the Survey of 1844\u201346, the area was returned at 4404 square miles, and the population at 1,602,274. The Census of 1872 disclosed a total population of 1,723,974 persons upon the area of the District as at present constituted. The last Census in 1881 returned the population at 1,964,909, showing an increase of 240,935, or 13\u00b797 per cent., between 1872 and 1881. This large increase in nine years is due entirely to natural causes, the District not having suffered from exceptional disease, and cultivation having been largely developed during these years, owing to the opening of irrigation canals.\n\nThe results of the Census of 1881 may be summarized as follows:\n\n\u2014Area of District, 4365 square miles; number of towns 10, and villages 5631; number of houses, 312,762, namely, occupied 274,934, and unoccupied 37,828. Population 1,964,909, namely, males 950,250, and females 1,014,659; proportion of males, 48\u00b74 per cent. Average density of population, 450 persons per square mile, ranging from 917 per square mile in Arrah th\u00e1n\u00e1, and 777 per square mile in Belauti in the thickly populated tracts in the neighbourhood of the Ganges, to 188 per square mile in Bhabu\u00e1, and 225 per square mile in S\u00e1sser\u00e1m in the west and south of the District, where there is much\nhilly and uncultivated land. Number of towns and villages throughout the District, 1'29 per square mile; persons per town or village, 348; houses per square mile, 71'65; inmates per occupied house, 7'15. Classified according to sex and age, the Census gives the following results\u2014under 15 years of age, boys 394,940, and girls 370,788; total children, 765,728, or 38'9 per cent. of the District population: 15 years and upwards, males 555,310, and females 643,871; total adults, 1,199,181, or 61'1 per cent.\n\nReligion.\u2014The great majority of the people are Hindus by religion, that faith being professed by 1,817,881 persons, or 92'5 per cent. of the total population; Muhammadans number 146,732, or 7'4 per cent.; Christians, 276; and 'others,' 20. Among the higher castes of Hindus, Br\u00e1hmans numbered 213,308; R\u00e1jputs, 207,195; B\u00e1bhans, 59,075; K\u00e1yasths, 46,994; and Baniy\u00e1s, 34,568. The lower or S\u00fadra castes included the following:\u2014Go\u00e1l\u00e1, cattle dealers, herdsmen, and dairy-men, who form the most numerous caste in the District, 242,721; Ko\u00e9ri, the principal agricultural caste, 152,846; Cham\u00e1rs, 119,010; Dos\u00e1dh, 90,155; Kandu, 68,427; K\u00farn\u00ed, 66,341; K\u00e1h\u00e1r, 62,812; Tel\u00ed, 47,836; Loh\u00e1r, 32,563; N\u00e1pit, 29,153; Bind, 24,582; Garer\u00ed, 23,817; Kum-bh\u00e1r, 23,814; Kalw\u00e1r, 20,126; Nuniy\u00e1, 18,666; Son\u00e1r, 18,139; Dhob\u00ed, 16,741; Mallah, 14,943; Barh\u00e1i, 14,741; Musah\u00e1r, 12,912; P\u00e1s\u00ed, 11,894; T\u00e1nt\u00ed, 7016; R\u00e1jwar, 6802; Dom, 5732; Tambuli, 5456; M\u00e1l\u00ed, 5100; Madak, 4836; Sunri, 4409; Keut or Kewat, 3389; Tatw\u00e1, 3372; Baru\u00ed, 2573; and Jugi, 2167. Caste-rejecting Hindus numbered 3033, of whom 1542 were Vaishnavs. Hinduized aboriginal tribes were returned at 31,401, including Gonds, 7089; Kh\u00e1rw\u00e1rs, 5959; Bhuiy\u00e1s, 301; and 'others,' 18,052. The Muhammadans were divided according to sect into\u2014Sunn\u00eds, 142,435; Shi\u00e1s, 3106; and unspecified, 1191. The Christian community consisted of\u2014Europeans, 166; Eurasians, 78; natives of India, 10; and 'others,' 22. By sect, 220 were Protestants or belonging to the Church of England; 40 were Roman Catholics; and 16 unspecified.\n\nUrban and Rural Population.\u2014Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d District contains eight towns with more than five thousand inhabitants, namely, Arrah, population (1881) 42,998; Dumraon, 17,429; Buxar, 16,498; Jag-dispur, 12,568; Bhojpur, 9278; Nasriganj, 6063; Bhabua, 5728; and Dhanganin, 5600. Two other towns are returned as municipalities, but with less than five thousand inhabitants, namely, Chenari, 3336; and Sasseram, 2531. The total urban population thus disclosed is 122,029, or 6'2 per cent. of the District population. There are altogether nine municipalities in the District, with a total population of 126,163; municipal income (1883\u201384), \u00a35464, of which \u00a33888 was derived from taxation; average incidence, 7'3d. per head of population within municipal limits. Of the 5631 villages, 2919 contain less\nthan two hundred inhabitants; 1611 between two and five hundred; 772 between five hundred and a thousand; 254 between one and two thousand; 53 between two and three thousand; and 21 between three and five thousand. As regards occupation, the Census Report divides the male population into the following six classes:\u2014(1) Professional class, including all Government servants, civil and military, 12,155; (2) domestic class, including inn and lodging-house keepers, 36,073; (3) commercial class, including merchants, bankers, traders, carriers, etc., 35,728; (4) agricultural and pastoral class, including gardeners, 307,604; (5) manufacturing and industrial class, including all artisans, 83,473; (6) indefinite and non-productive class, comprising general labourers and male children, 475,217.\n\nAntiquities.\u2014The principal place of interest in the District, from an antiquarian point of view, is the fort of Roht\u00e1s or Rohtasgarh, so called from Prince Rohit\u00e1swa, son of Harischandra, one of the kings of the Solar dynasty. The present buildings were erected by M\u00e1n Singh, soon after he was appointed Viceroy of Bengal and Behar in 1644. The remains of the fortress occupy a part of the K\u00e1imur table-land, measuring about 4 miles from east to west, and 5 miles from north to south. Other places of interest in Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d are the ruins of Shergarh fort, named after Sher Sh\u00e1h, its founder; Chainpur fort, with several interesting monuments and tombs; Darauti and Baidyan\u00e1th, with ruins attributed to the Suars or Sivir\u00e1s; Mas\u00e1r, the Mo-ho-so-lo of Hiuen Tsiang; Chaus\u00e1, the scene of the defeat of Hum\u00e1y\u00fan in 1539 by Sher Sh\u00e1h; Tilothu, near which are a fine waterfall and a very ancient Cheru image; and Patan\u00e1, once the capital of a Hindu R\u00e1j\u00e1 of the Suar tribe. A description of these places will be found under their respective names. The sacred cave of Guptasar lies in the centre of the K\u00e1imur plateau, 7 miles from Shergarh.\n\nThe town of Arrah is invested with a special historical interest, as being the scene of a stirring episode in the Mutiny of 1857. A body of rebels, consisting of about 2000 Sepoys from Din\u00e1pur and four times as many armed villagers, under Ku\u00e1r Singh, marched in the end of July on Arrah. They reached the town on the 27th of that month, and forthwith released all the prisoners in the jail, and plundered the treasury. The European women and children had already been sent away, but there remained in the town about a dozen Englishmen, official and non-official, and three or four other Christians of different races. The Commissioner of Patn\u00e1, Mr. Tayler, had supplied a garrison of 50 Sikhs. This small force held out for a long eight days, until rescued by Major Vincent Eyre. The centre of defence had been wisely chosen. At this time the East Indian Railway was in course of construction, under the local superintendence of Mr. Vicars Boyle, who, fortunately, had some knowledge of\nfortification. He occupied two houses, now known as the Judge's houses, the smaller of which, a two-storied building about 20 yards from the main house, was forthwith fortified and provisioned. The lower windows, etc. were built up, and sand-bags ranged on the roof.\n\nWhen the news came that the mutineers were advancing along the Arrah road, the Europeans and Sikhs retired to the smaller house. The rebels, after pillaging the town, made straight for Mr. Boyle's little fortress. A volley dispersed them, and forced them to seek the shelter of the larger house, only a few yards off, whence they carried on an almost continuous fire. They attempted to burn or smoke out the little garrison, and tried various other safe modes of attack, but they had no guns. Ku\u00e1r Singh, however, produced two small cannon which he had dug up, and artillery missiles were improvised out of the house furniture. In the small house there was no thought of surrender. Mr. Herwald Wake, the Magistrate, put himself in command of the Sikhs, who, though sorely tempted by their countrymen among the mutineers, remained faithful throughout the siege. A relieving party of 150 European troops, sent by water from Din\u00e1pur, fell into an ambuscade on landing in Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d; and as time passed away and no help arrived, provisions and water began to run short. A bold midnight sally resulted in the capture of 4 sheep, and water was obtained by digging a well 18 feet deep inside the house. A mine of the enemy was met by countermining.\n\nOn the 2nd August, the besieged party observed an unusual excitement in the neighbourhood. The fire of the enemy had slackened, and but few of them were visible. The sound of a distant cannonade was heard. Before sunset the siege was at an end, and on the following morning the gallant garrison welcomed their deliverers\u2014Major Vincent Eyre with 150 men of the 5th Fusiliers, a few mounted volunteers, and 3 guns with 34 artillerymen. Major Eyre had dispersed Ku\u00e1r Singh's forces on his way to Arrah, and they never rallied.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014The chief staple of Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d is rice, of which three principal crops are grown, namely\u2014the bhada\u00ed or early crop, which is sown in July or August, and ripens in about sixty days; the b\u00e1wag, sown broadcast in June or July, and reaped in November and December; and the rop\u00e1 or winter crop, which is also sown in June and July, and reaped in December and January. Besides these, a very limited area is planted with boro rice, sown in November and cut in April. Many varieties of each rice crop are named. The other crops of the District include\u2014wheat, barley, maize, and other cereals; gram, peas, lentils, and several other green crops; t\u012bl, linseed, castor-oil, and mustard; many kinds of vegetables; cotton, hemp and jute, poppy, sugar-cane, betel-leaf, tobacco, safflower, indigo, etc. Roughly speaking, it may be estimated that of the total area (2,808,400 acres) of the\nDistrict, 2,200,000 acres are under cultivation. The area usually covered by autumn (bhadai) and winter (aghani) food crops is about 1,500,000 acres; that occupied by spring or rabi food crops, 600,000 acres; and that under other than food staples, 100,000 acres. The area under poppy is about 22,000 acres (average out-turn, $27\\frac{1}{2}$ lbs. of opium per acre); that under tobacco, only 300 acres.\n\nShahabad has, on the whole, a much drier soil than the trans-Gangetic Districts of Saran, Muzaffarpur, and Darbhanga. Along the north of the District runs a fringe of low-lying khadir land, representing the bed of the Banas or old Ganges, which is inundated for about four months every year, when the main stream is in full flood. Cold-weather crops of the finest character are grown here, on a soil enriched by the silt brought down by every flood. Very little land has been rendered uncultivable owing to blown sand from the bed of the Son (Soane). The soil is light for a few miles west of that river during the greater part of its course, except at its mouth, where the influence of the Ganges makes itself felt. This light soil may be divided into two classes\u2014one consisting of fine sand mixed with a loose mould; the other a very tenacious clay, intermixed with a good deal of coarse sand. Both soils, so long as they are kept moist, produce good crops; but without irrigation they grow nothing, except a few pulses sown in the rains. Throughout the District, a free mould forms a large portion of the soil; when quite free, it is known as doras, pairu, and dhash; when mixed with a little clay, it is called sigat. This last soil is especially suited for rice. Clay or bangar lands are considered the best, on the whole, as they retain moisture very well, and produce cold-weather crops without irrigation. The soil in the saucer-shaped valleys on the Kaimur plateau is a rich and purely vegetable mould, swept down from the hills above.\n\nA holding of above 100 acres in extent is considered a very large farm, and anything below 3\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) acres a very small one. A fair-sized comfortable holding for a husbandman cultivating his own lands would be about 13 acres. A small-sized holding of 5 acres, which is as much as a single pair of bullocks can cultivate, would not make a peasant so well off as a respectable retail shopkeeper; but it would enable him to live as well as a man receiving 16s. a month in money wages.\n\nShahabad District contains a small but increasing class of day-labourers, called banihargs, who neither possess nor rent lands, but depend entirely on their wages. These men often hire themselves out as field-labourers, and are paid by a share (sometimes amounting to one-sixteenth) of the produce. In this case they are called lajhiis. They occasionally supply half the seed and half the number of cattle required. It is supposed that this class first sprang up when the railway was being constructed; and it has been largely fostered by the demand for labour on the Son Canal works.\nWages and prices are reported to have risen, but the figures for early years are not available. The Government irrigation scheme already described has considerably raised the price of labour; and masons, carpenters, and blacksmiths, who before the opening of the canal works earned from 4\u00bdd. to 6d. a day, now make from 6d. to 9d. The cultivators pay their rent either in kind (bh\u00e1oli) or in cash. The latter system prevails everywhere in the case of special crops, such as poppy, sugar-cane, cotton, and potatoes, and is universal for all crops in the north of the District. Under the bh\u00e1oli system, the proportion taken by the landlord varies according to the crop. Thus, for broadcast rice, the customary landlord\u2019s share is a little less than one-half; while for transplanted rice, and wheat, and generally where irrigation requires to be carried on from wells, the landlord\u2019s share is one-third. Where money rents prevail, the following are returned as the outside rates:\u2014For early rice land, on which an after-crop of pulses, vegetables, oil-seeds, etc. is grown, 1s. 7d. to 15s. 10d. an acre; for late rice land, generally a single crop, 3s. 2d. to 15s. 10d. an acre; other food-grains, such as wheat, peas, etc., and linseed, 2s. 4\u00bdd. to \u00a31, 11s. 8d. an acre.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d is subject to blight, flood, and drought. Blights, although they occasionally cause considerable damage, never occur on such a scale as to affect the general harvest. The Ganges annually overflows its banks; but the principal inundations result from the rising of the Son on the elevated plateau of Central India. Destructive floods have only occurred during the last few years, since a portion of the high land that formerly protected the District was washed away. About one-sixth of the total area is subject to inundation. Droughts arising from deficient rainfall, and the want of an extensive and complete system of irrigation, frequently caused distress previous to the opening of the canal works described above; and four times in the course of five years\u2014in 1865, 1866, 1867, and 1869\u2014drought seriously affected the harvest. The Son Canals have now, as has been stated, secured for the District immunity from future famine.\n\nCommerce and Trade, etc.\u2014The trade of the District is chiefly carried on by means of permanent markets in the towns, and at fairs. The most frequented of these fairs are held at Barhampur near Raghun\u00e1thpur railway station, Bax\u00e1r, Zakh\u00e1n\u00ed, Dhusariy\u00e1, Padaman\u00ed\u00e1n, Gadahn\u00ed, Kastar Danwar, Dham\u00e1r, Mas\u00e1rh, and Guptasar. The principal exports are\u2014rice, wheat, barley, pulses, gram, oats, linseed, carraway-seed, paper, and spices; the chief imports\u2014cleaned rice, betel-nut, tobacco, sugar, molasses, salt, pepper, cotton, iron, brass, zinc, copper, lead, tin, and betel-leaf or p\u00e1n. The two great highways of trade to and from the District are the Ganges and the East Indian Railway. The railway runs through the District for a distance of 60 miles, from\nKoelw\u00e1r station on the Son to Chaus\u00e1 on the Karamn\u00e1sa, the intermediate stations being Arrah, Bih\u00edy\u00e1, Raghun\u00e1thpur, Dumr\u00e1on, and Bax\u00e1r. The aggregate length of roads in the District, exclusive of village tracks, is about a thousand miles, maintained from the proceeds of a road cess of 1 per cent. on the land revenue of the District. The principal manufactures are sugar, paper, saltpetre, blankets, coarse cotton cloth, and brass utensils. The figures supplied for the first edition of this work returned 58 sugar refineries in the District in 1872-73 (of which 42 were at Nasr\u00edganj), and the amount manufactured at 965 tons, valued at \u00a328,350. Statistics for a later year are not available. Paper is made at S\u00e1h\u00e1r and Har\u00edharganj, both on the Son; and blankets and carpets in the S\u00e1sser\u00e1m and Bhabu\u00e1 Sub-divisions.\n\nAdministration.\u2014So far as can now be ascertained, it would appear that the net revenue of Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d increased from \u00a3101,851 in 1790-91 to \u00a3167,277 in 1849-50, to \u00a3233,978 in 1870-71, and to \u00a3253,554 in 1883-84; while the net expenditure, in like manner, increased from \u00a35627 in 1790-91 to \u00a325,046 in 1849-50, and to \u00a344,158 in 1870-71; while it fell to \u00a337,937 in 1883-84. The land-tax forms the principal item of revenue here, as elsewhere in Bengal; and the amount collected increased from \u00a397,508 in 1790 to \u00a3171,263 in 1883-84. The number of estates has more than doubled in the same time, being 2330 in 1790, and 5961 in 1883; while the number of proprietors has increased by nearly fifty-fold, namely, from 1289 in 1790 to 50,410 in 1883. In the former year, the average amount paid by each proprietor was \u00a380, 14s., and in the latter year, \u00a33, 8s.\n\nFor administrative purposes, the District is divided into 4 Sub-divisions, and 11 th\u00e1n\u00e1s or police circles, as follows:\u2014(1) Arrah or headquarters Sub-division, with the three police circles of Arrah, Belauti, and Piru; (2) Bax\u00e1r Sub-division, with the two police circles of Bax\u00e1r and Dumr\u00e1on; (3) S\u00e1sser\u00e1m Sub-division, with the four police circles of S\u00e1sser\u00e1m, Kharghar, Dhang\u00e1in, and Dehr\u00ed; and (4) Bhabu\u00e1 Sub-division, with the two police circles of Bhabu\u00e1 and Moh\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1. Number of civil judges (1883-84), 8; stipendiary magistrates, 12. In 1883 the regular and town police force numbered 611 officers and men of all ranks, maintained at a total cost of \u00a310,024. There was also a rural police or village watch of 4854 men, costing in money or lands an estimated sum of \u00a310,996. The total machinery, therefore, for the protection of person and property consisted of 5465 officers and men, giving 1 man to every 0.79 square mile of the area or to every 359 persons of the population. The estimated total cost was \u00a321,020, equal to an average of \u00a34, 16s. 4d. per square mile of area and nearly 2\u00bdd. per head of population. In 1883-84, 2562 persons were convicted of an offence of some sort, great or small. The District has 4 jails, which contained in 1883 an average daily number of 214 prisoners.\nThe number of Government and aided schools in Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d in 1856\u201357 was 8, with 354 pupils; in 1870\u201371 there were only 13 such schools, attended by 589 pupils. Since the latter year, however, owing to the encouragement of primary education by an extension of the grant-in-aid system, the number of Government and aided schools has largely increased. In 1871\u201372 there were 47 schools, with 1572 pupils; and in 1877\u201378 there were 282, attended by 7211 pupils. In 1883\u201384, by which time the grant-in-aid system had received full development, there were 1337 lower primary schools under Government inspection, attended by 20,883 pupils. The Arrah District school had 464 pupils in 1883\u201384. The Census of 1881 returned 13,960 boys and 385 girls as under instruction, besides 36,930 males and 1024 females able to read and write but not under instruction.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate of Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d is fairly healthy. The prevailing endemic diseases are intermittent and remittent fevers, bowel complaints, and skin diseases. Cholera and small-pox occur from time to time in an epidemic form. The total number of registered deaths in the District in 1883\u201384 was 36,930, showing a death-rate of 21\u00b728 per thousand. Seven charitable dispensaries afforded medical relief in 1883 to 690 in-door and 37,169 out-door patients. Average annual rainfall for 25 years ending 1881, 45\u00b724 inches, distributed as follows:\u2014January to May, 4\u00b708 inches; June to September, 38\u00b715 inches; and October to December, 3\u00b701 inches. In 1883\u201384 the rainfall was 32\u00b719 inches, or 13\u00b705 inches below the average, the deficiency being conspicuous in all three seasons.

Bounded on the north by Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur District in the North-Western Provinces, on the east by Muhamdi tahsil, on the south by Hardoi tahsil, and on the west by Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d District in the North-Western Provinces. Area, 539 square miles, of which 310 are cultivated. Population (1881) 216,825, namely, Hindus, 189,000; Muhammadans, 27,823; and 'others,' 2. Males 116,752, and females 100,073; average density of population, 402 persons per square mile. Of the 520 towns and villages in the tahsil, 397 contain less than five hundred inhabitants; 92 between five hundred and a thousand; 29 between one and five thousand; and 2 upwards of five thousand inhabitants.\nGovernment land revenue, \u00a38836. This Sub-division comprises the 8 parganas of Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d, Alamnagar, Pih\u00e1ni, Mansurnagar, S\u00e1r\u00e1 (North), Saromannagar, P\u00e1li, and Pachhoha. In 1884 it contained 1 civil and 3 criminal courts; police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), 3; regular and town police, 118 men; village watch or rural police (chaukid\u00e1rs), 595.\n\nSh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d.\u2014Pargan\u00e1 of Hardoi District, Oudh. Bounded on the north by Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur District in the North-Western Provinces; on the east by Alamnagar and S\u00e1r\u00e1, the Sukheta river forming the boundary line; on the south by Saromannagar; and on the west by Pachhoha and P\u00e1li, from which it is separated by the Garra river. Area, 131 square miles, of which 81 are cultivated. Chief products\u2014wheat, barley, b\u00e1jra, gram, jo\u00e1r, rice, arhar, and sugar-cane. At the time of the revenue survey, wheat occupied about one-third of the cultivated area; barley and b\u00e1jra each about a tenth; and gram, jo\u00e1r, and rice together about a fourth. Population (1881) 67,182, namely, Hindus 55,867, and Muhammadans 11,315. Of the 143 villages that make up the pargan\u00e1, 72 are held by Muhammadans, 25\u00bd by Br\u00e1hmans, 21\u00bd by R\u00e1jputs, 9 by K\u00e1yasths, 1 by Gos\u00e1ins, 1 by Europeans, and 13 by the Government. The varieties of tenure are\u2014t\u00e1lukd\u00e1ri, 26 villages; zamind\u00e1ri, 82; and pattid\u00e1ri, 35. Government land revenue, \u00a39342, equal to an average of 3s. 7\u00bdd. per cultivated acre, or 2s. 2\u00bed. per acre of total area. The Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway runs through the pargan\u00e1, with a station near Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d town.\n\nThe country was originally in the hands of the Thatheras, whose chief settlement seems to have been at and around Angni Khera, on the site of Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d town. They are said to have been dispossessed in the 8th century A.D. by a band of Br\u00e1hmans, who were on a pilgrimage from Benares to Hardw\u00e1r. The Br\u00e1hmans retained possession of Angni Khera and the surrounding country till the reign of Aurangzeb, when, having plundered a convoy of treasure on its way to Delhi, a retaliatory expedition was sent out under an Afgh\u00e1n chief, Diler Kh\u00e1n, who surprised the Br\u00e1hmans at a bathing festival, slew them, and took possession of their lands, which were confirmed to him by the Delhi Emperor. Diler Kh\u00e1n founded the town of Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d on the old site of Angni Khera, which he filled with his Afgh\u00e1n kinsmen and troops, assigning them jungle grants in the neighbourhood. Diler Kh\u00e1n\u2019s family gradually extended their possessions, acquiring either by purchase, mortgage, fraud, or force, every village in the pargan\u00e1, which they held as proprietors till some fifty or sixty years ago, when the family began to decay and the estate to fall to pieces. The old proprietors in some cases succeeded in recovering possession of their villages, mostly by purchase from the Naw\u00e1b\u2019s family. The descendants of Diler Kh\u00e1n, however, still hold possession of more than one-half of the pargan\u00e1.\nSh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d.\u2014Town and municipality in Hardoi District, and headquarters of Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d tahsil and pargan\u00e1; situated on the road from Lucknow to Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d, 15 miles from the latter town, in lat. $27^\\circ 38' 25''$ N., and long. $79^\\circ 59' 5''$ E. The most populous town in the District, and the fourth largest in Oudh. Population (1881) 18,510, namely, males 9,210, and females 9,300. Hindus number 10,784, and Muhammadans 7,726. Municipal income (1883-84), \u00a3383, of which \u00a3312 was derived from taxation; average incidence of taxation, 4d. per head.\n\nThe town is divided into wards or mahallas, named for the most part after the companions in arms of the founder, Diler Kh\u00e1n. It is connected with Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur, P\u00e1li, S\u00e1ndi, Hardoi, and Pih\u00e1n\u00ed by unmetalled roads; it is also a station on the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway. The Sub-divisional courts and police station are placed in the enclosure of the Jam\u00e1 Masjid, a mosque built by Diler Kh\u00e1n. Vernacular school, dispensary, and sar\u00e1i (travellers\u2019 rest-house). No trade or manufacture of importance. Several markets are held in the different wards.\n\nSh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d town has decreased in importance during the past hundred years, the inhabitants dating the decay from the decline of the Delhi Empire, and the rise of Oudh to independence. The present population is said to be only one-third of what it was formerly. Tieffenthaler describes Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d, about 1770 A.D., as \u2018of considerable circuit, and nearly in the middle is a palace of brick strengthened with towers like a fortress (the Bari Deorhi constructed by Diler Kh\u00e1n), with a vestibule and spacious covered colonnade. Most of the houses are of brick, and there is a fine mosque built of the same material, and enclosed by a wall. The town extends a mile from north to south, its breadth is something less, but of its flourishing state little remains.\u2019 When visited by Tennant in 1799, it was an expanse of ruins, \u2018that appeared in the form of hills, and broken, crumbling to dust.\u2019 Heber found it in 1824 \u2018a considerable town, or almost city, with the remains of fortifications and many large houses.\u2019\n\nThe following account of Shah\u00e1b\u00e1d in 1850 is quoted from Sir W. Sleeman\u2019s Tour through Oudh, vol. ii. pp. 46, 47. It is interesting as giving the origin of the chronic ill-feeling that exists between the Muhammadans and Hindus, which broke out into a riot at the Muharram festival of 1868:\u2014\u2018Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d is a very ancient and large town, occupied chiefly by Path\u00e1n Musalm\u00e1ns, who are a very turbulent and fanatical set of fellows. Subsukh R\u00e1i, a Hindu, and the most respectable merchant in the District, resided here, and for some time consented to officiate as the deputy of poor old H\u00e1fiz Abdull\u00e1 for the management of the town, where his influence was great. He had lent a good deal of money to the heads of some of the Path\u00e1n families of the town; but finding few of them disposed to repay, he was last year obliged to refuse\nfurther loans. They determined to take advantage of the coming Muharram festival to revenge the affront, as men commonly do who live among such a fanatical community. The tazias are commonly taken up and carried in procession ten days after the new moon is first seen at any place where they are made; but in Oudh, all go by the day in which the moon is seen from the capital of Lucknow. As soon as she is seen at Lucknow, the king issues an order throughout his dominions for the tazias to be taken in procession ten days after. The moon was this year (1850), in November, first seen on the 30th of the month at Lucknow; but at Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d, where the sky is generally clearer, she had been seen on the 29th. The men to whom Subsukh R\u00e1\u00ed had refused further loans determined to take advantage of this incident to wreak their vengeance; and when the deputy promulgated the king's order for the tazias to be taken in procession ten days after the 30th, they instigated all the Muhammadans of the town to insist upon taking them out ten days after the 29th, and persuaded them that the order had been fabricated or altered by the malice of their Hindu deputy to insult their religious feelings. The tazias were taken out accordingly; and having to pass the house of Subsukh R\u00e1\u00ed, when their excitement or spirit of religious fervour had reached the highest pitch, they there put them down, broke open the doors, entered in a crowd, and plundered it of all the property they could find, amounting to about 70,000 rupees. Subsukh R\u00e1\u00ed was obliged to get out with his family at a back door, and run for his life. He went to Sh\u00e1hj\u00e1hn\u00e1pur, in our territory, and put himself under the protection of the Magistrate. Not content with all this, the Muhammadans built a small miniature mosque at the door with some loose bricks, so that no one could go either out or in without the risk of knocking it down, or so injuring this mock mosque as to rouse, or enable the evil-minded to rouse, the whole Muhammadan population against the offender. Poor Subsukh R\u00e1\u00ed has been utterly ruined, and ever since seeking in vain for redress. The Government is neither disposed nor able to afford it, and the poor boy who has now succeeded his learned father in the contract is helpless. The little mock mosque of uncemented bricks still stands as a monument of the insolence of the Muhammadan population, and the weakness and apathy of the Oudh Government.\n\nSh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d.\u2014Town in Pipli tahsil, Amb\u00e1l\u00e1 (Umballa) District, Punjab; situated in lat. 30\u00b0 10' N., and long. 76\u00b0 55', on the Grand Trunk road, 16 miles south of Amb\u00e1l\u00e1 town.

Population (1881) less than 2000. Sh\u00e1hbandar stood formerly on the east bank of the Malir, one of the mouths of the Indus, but it is at present 10 miles distant from the nearest point of the river. The great salt waste commences about a mile to the southeast of the town, and on its westward side are extensive jungles of long bin grass. It was to Sh\u00e1hbandar that the English factory was removed from Aurang\u00e1b\u00e1d when the latter place was deserted by the Indus; and previous to the abandonment of the factory in 1775, it supported an establishment of 14 vessels for the navigation of the river. The disastrous flood which occurred about 1819 caused material changes in the lower part of the Indus, and hastened the decay of Sh\u00e1hbandar, which is now an insignificant village. Carless states that the native rulers of Sind had a fleet of 15 ships stationed here. Vessels entered by the Richal, the only accessible mouth, and passing into the Haj\u00e1mro through what is now the Khedew\u00e1ri creek, ascended that stream to about 10 miles above Ghoreb\u00e1ri, where it joined the Malir.

Mosque, 2 temples, and vernacular school.\n\n**Sh\u00e1hgarh.**\u2014Chief town of a tract bearing the same name in Band\u00e1 tahsil, S\u00e1g\u00e1r (Saugor) District, Central Provinces; situated in lat. 24\u00b0 19' N., and long. 79\u00b0 E., 40 miles north-east of S\u00e1g\u00e1r town. Originally part of the Gond kingdom of M\u00e1ndl\u00e1, it continued till 1857 to be the head-quarters of an independent chief of ancient lineage. Population (1881) 2155, namely, Hindus, 1747; Muhammadans, 241; Kab\u00edranth\u00eds, 43; Jains, 123; and 'other,' 1. Sh\u00e1hgarh stands at the foot of a lofty hill range, with jungle on nearly every side. The small fort, now in ruins, on the east of the village, contained the R\u00e1j\u00e1's palace. At the villages of B\u00e1ret\u00e1, Amarmau, H\u00edr\u00e1p\u00far, and Tigor\u00e1, all in the north of the tract, iron-ore is smelted and sent to Cawnpur. Markets are held every Tuesday and Saturday; Government boys' school, girls' school, and dispensary.\n\n**Sh\u00e1hi.**\u2014Canal in Gurd\u00e1spur, Amritsar, and Lahore Districts, Punjab.\u2014See Hasl\u00ed.\n\n**Shahiw\u00e1l.**\u2014Town in Sh\u00e1hpur tahsil, Sh\u00e1hpur District, Punjab.\u2014See Sah\u00edwal.\n\n**Sh\u00e1jh\u00e1h\u00e1npur.**\u2014A British District in the Lieutenant-Governorship of the North-Western Provinces, lying between 27\u00b0 35' and 28\u00b0 28' 15\" N. lat., and between 79\u00b0 23' and 80\u00b0 25' 45\" E. long. Area (1881), 1745 square miles. Population, 856,946 souls. Sh\u00e1jh\u00e1h\u00e1npur forms\nthe easternmost District of the Rohilkhand Division. It is bounded on the north-west and north by Pilibhit and Bareilly (Bareli) Districts; on the east by the Oudh District of Kheri; on the south by Hardoi District, and by the Ganges, which separates it from Farukhabad District; and on the west by Budaul and Bareilly Districts. The administrative head-quarters are at the city of Shahjahanpur.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The District of Shahjahanpur consists of a long narrow tract, running upward from the Ganges in the south-west towards the Himalayas, reaching to within 3 miles of the Sarda river on the north-east, nearly at right angles to the river system of the Rohilkhand plain. Hence its natural features depend almost entirely upon the various streams which have cut themselves deep channels through the alluvial soil of the Gangetic basin. The north-eastern corner, beyond the G\u00famti, presents an appearance not unlike that of the tar\u00e1\u00ed or damp submontane belt. A large area still remains under forest, or lies otherwise waste. A scanty population inhabits this malarious tract; but water rises close to the surface, and the natural fertility of the soil is only marred by the feverish exhalations.\n\nThe next section, between the G\u00famti and the Khanaut, passes from a rather wild and unhealthy northern region to a densely inhabited strip along the southern river, consisting of a productive loam, well cultivated with sugar-cane and other remunerative crops. The Khanaut falls into the Deoha or Garra just below Shahjahanpur city; and the triangle enclosed between the confluent streams, though fertile in the immediate neighbourhood of their valleys, consists of a thinly peopled country, overgrown with thorn and dh\u00e1k jungle.\n\nThe section between the Deoha and the Gar\u00e1i comprises much marshy land; but south of the latter river, the country rises in a sandy ridge, till it reaches the valley of the R\u00e1mgang\u00e1, through which the stream wanders in changing courses, destroying and re-forming its banks with great rapidity. Thence to the Ganges stretches a continuous lowland, consisting of marshy patches alternating with a stiff clay soil, and requiring irrigation in parts. This is supplied by the Sot and other streams, which are utilized by being dammed up at particular places, and the water thus stored is distributed in channels, often to great distances. Cultivation is here less easy and less remunerative. In the bed of the Ganges, at the extreme south of the District, are lowlands covered with high grass and brushwood.\n\nThe R\u00e1mgang\u00e1 and the Deoha or Garra change their channels in a most arbitrary manner; the R\u00e1mgang\u00e1 to an extent perhaps unparalleled in the case of any river of equal volume. Each rapidly replaces the land destroyed by fresh alluvial deposits; and there are thus two broad lines of rich soil crossing the District. These tracts of alluvial deposit, alternating with hard clay, occupy, with the great sandy ridge\nthat lies between the valleys of the R\u00e1mgang\u00e1 and Deoha, the whole southern and central parts of the District. The northern part may be roughly divided into two tracts\u2014(1) the moist tar\u00e1di-like tract comprising Kh\u00fat\u00e1r pargan\u00e1 and the northern part of Paw\u00e1yan; and (2) the rich sugar-producing country about Paw\u00e1yan and Bar\u00e1g\u00e1on. There are in each tract minor variations, narrow ridges of light soil above the smaller rivers and streams, or small tracts of hard soil in depressions near the larger jhils or lakes.\n\nThe R\u00e1mgang\u00e1 forms the main waterway of the District, being navigable as far as Kola Gh\u00e1t, near Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d, whence considerable quantities of cereals and pulses are shipped in country boats by Cawnpur traders for the Ganges ports. A few swampy lakes (jhils) in the lower portions of the District afford irrigation for the spring crops in their neighbourhood. No large pasture-grounds exist anywhere, but cattle are sent in large herds from the northern pargan\u00e1s to graze in Nep\u00e1l during the cold weather, returning at the commencement of the rains.\n\nKh\u00fat\u00e1r pargan\u00e1, in the north of the District, contains a wide area of still unreclaimed jungle, consisting chiefly of s\u00e1l, but not now containing any large trees. The jungles are, however, of great value, as furnishing large quantities of timber for house-building purposes. Two smaller tracts of the same description of jungle exist in Paw\u00e1yan pargan\u00e1\u2014one on the river G\u00famti, and one on the Khanaut; but in the rest of the District, the jungle consists simply of dwarf dh\u00e1k and thorn bushes, and is almost confined to the hardest and poorest soil in Nigohi, Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d, and Jamaur pargan\u00e1s. The total of this unreclaimed area, consisting of forest, dh\u00e1k jungle, open grass land, etc., amounted at the time of the land settlement to $226\\frac{1}{2}$ square miles, or 17 per cent. of the whole District area. The only mineral product of Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur is kankar, or nodular limestone, either burnt into lime, or used in its raw state for road metalling.\n\nFerae Naturae.\u2014Leopards are not uncommon in the jungle tracts in the north of the District; and a wandering tiger or lynx is occasionally shot. Spotted deer frequent the northern jungle, and nilg\u00e1i and wild hog are found in small numbers in the patches of dh\u00e1k scrub scattered about the District. The antelope is met with in small numbers almost everywhere, and in large herds on the highlands near the G\u00famti, and in the valley of the Ganges. Smaller game comprises floriken, hare, black and grey partridge, quail, sand-grouse, and peafowl, found almost everywhere. The large ponds and marshes abound in water-fowl of all sorts; and several kinds of geese, ducks, teal, and snipe afford excellent sport for about four months during the cold season.\n\nHistory.\u2014Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur possesses little separate history of its own\nbefore its annexation by the British in 1801. During the early Musalm\u00e1n times, it always formed part of Katheriya proper, or the country of the Katheriya Rajputs, nearly the whole of its parganas lying east of the Ramganga; and it was then included under the government of Budau\u1e47. Shahjah\u0101npur town was founded in the reign of Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n by Naw\u0101b Bah\u0101dur Kh\u0101n, a Path\u0101n, who named it in honour of the Emperor. About 1720, Al\u012b Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n, who had risen into power at the head of his Rohill\u0101 clansmen, defeated the Governors of Bareilly (Bareli) and Moradabad, and himself assumed the rule of those two Districts, together with Shahjah\u0101npur. On his death in 1751, H\u0101fiz Rahmat Kh\u0101n, the guardian of his sons, became leader of the Rohill\u0101s, and defeated the imperial troops sent against him. Shahjah\u0101npur remained under the Bareilly authorities till 1774, when the Naw\u0101b Waz\u012br of Oudh overran Rohilkhand with the aid of Warren Hastings. The Rohill\u0101s, however, had never gained complete control over the eastern portion of Shahjah\u0101npur District, though their power was firmly established in the west. The Gaur or Katheriya Th\u0101kurs also retained their independence among the wild wastes of the north. Shahjah\u0101npur, indeed, lying on the border between Oudh and Rohilkhand, formed a sort of debateable land between the two Provinces; but the sympathies and connections of the Shahjah\u0101npur Path\u0101ns lay always with Oudh rather than with the Rohill\u0101s. The Naw\u0101b Wazirs held Rohilkhand from 1774 till 1801, when it was ceded to the English by the treaty of Lucknow.\n\nThenceforward, our rule was never disturbed until the Mutiny, although the District bordered upon the most turbulent part of Oudh. In 1857, however, Shahjah\u0101npur became the scene of open rebellion. The news of the Meerut (Merath) outbreak arrived on the 15th of May; but all remained quiet till the 25th, when the sepoys informed their officers that the mob intended to plunder the treasury. Precautions were taken against such an attempt; but on the 31st, while most of the officers, civil and military, were at church, some of the sepoys forced their way into the building and attacked them. Three Europeans were shot down at once; the remainder closed the doors, and aided by their servants, together with a hundred faithful sepoys, held the church against the mutineers. The other officers then joined them, and the whole party escaped, first to Paw\u0101yan, and afterwards to Muhamdi. The mutineers burnt the station, plundered the treasury, and made their way to the centre of local disaffection at Bareilly.\n\nA rebel Government, under K\u0101dir Al\u012b Kh\u0101n, was proclaimed on the 1st of June. On the 18th, Ghul\u0101m K\u0101dir Kh\u0101n, the hereditary Naw\u0101b of Shahjah\u0101npur, passed through on his way to Bareilly, where he was appointed N\u0101zim of Shahjah\u0101npur by Kh\u0101n Bah\u0101dur Kh\u0101n. On the 23rd the Naw\u0101b returned to his titular post, and superseded K\u0101dir\nAli. He remained in power from June 1857 till January 1858, when our troops reoccupied Fatehgarh. The Naw\u00e1b of Fatehgarh and Firoz Sh\u00e1h then fled to Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur, and on to Bareilly. After the fall of Lucknow, the N\u00e1na S\u00e1hib also fled to Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur, but remained only ten days, and proceeded onward to Bareilly. In January, the Naw\u00e1b put to death H\u00e1mid Hassan Kh\u00e1n, Deputy Collector, and Muhammad Hassan, subordinate judge, for corresponding with the English. On the 30th of April 1858, the British force under Lord Clyde reached Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur. The rebels fled to Muhamdi, and the British went on to Bareilly on the 2nd of May, leaving only a small detachment to guard the station. The rebels then assembled once more, and besieged our troops for nine days; but Brigadier Jones\u2019 column relieved them on the 12th, and authority was then finally re-established.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The Census of 1853 returned the number of inhabitants at 986,096 persons. That of 1865 showed a total of 1,018,117, being an increase of 32,021 persons, or 3\u00b72 per cent. The Census of 1872 gave the population as 951,006, showing a further decrease of 67,111 persons, or 6\u00b76 per cent., since 1866; and of 35,090 persons, or 3\u00b75 per cent., in the whole nineteen years. These returns yield, however, fallacious inferences, if compared with the area, which increased by 20 square miles in the first twelve years, and decreased by 605 square miles, or 35\u00b71 per cent., in the seven years from 1865 to 1872, owing to the transfer of Puranpur pargan\u00e1 to Pilibhit District. The real rate of increase may best be seen from the figures representing the density of population, which amounted to 427 persons per square mile in 1853, 437 in 1865, and 549 in 1872. It must be borne in mind that the pargan\u00e1 transferred to Pilibhit between 1865 and 1872, lying close to the foot of the Him\u00e1layas in the pestilential tar\u00e1i, had a much sparser population than any other portion of the District.\n\nAt the last Census in 1881, the population was returned at 856,946, showing a real decrease of 94,060, or 9\u00b79 per cent., since 1872. This decrease is wholly due to the effects of the famine of 1877\u201378, in which Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur suffered terribly, the mortality from starvation, or diseases caused by privation, being estimated at not less than 150,000. For details of this famine, see the section of this article, post, on Natural Calamities.\n\nThe results of the Census of 1881 may be briefly summarized as follows:\u2014Area of District, 1745\u00b77 square miles; number of towns 6, and of villages 2020; houses, 123,640. Average density of population, 491 persons per square mile; towns or villages per square mile, 1\u00b716; persons per town or village, 423; houses per square mile, 70\u00b78; inmates per house, 6\u00b79. Total population 856,946, namely, males 460,064, and females 396,882; proportion of males, 53\u00b76 per\ncent. The excessive proportion of males is doubtless due to the former prevalence of female infanticide; but the Infanticide Act has been put in force in certain villages of the District, and is working well for the suppression of the practice. In 1881, in five clans of R\u00e1jputs, Ah\u00edrs, Ahars, G\u00fajars, and J\u00e1ts, suspected of infanticide and proclaimed as such to the number of 129,886, the proportion of females was as low as 43\u00b72 per cent. That the Act is working satisfactorily is proved by the fact that of 30,461 children under ten years of age belonging to the above tribes, females numbered 14,259, or 46\u00b77 per cent. Classified according to sex and age, Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur contained in 1881\u2014under 15 years of age, boys 173,119, and girls 143,393; total children, 316,512, or 36\u00b79 per cent. of the population: 15 years and upwards, males 286,945, and females 253,489; total adults, 540,434, or 63\u00b71 per cent.\n\nReligion.\u2014As regards religious distinctions, the population is classified as follows:\u2014Hindus, 735,244, or 85\u00b78 per cent. of the District population; Muhammadans, 120,214; Christians, 1408; Sikhs, 78; and P\u00e1rs\u00eds, 2. Of higher caste Hindus, Br\u00e1hmans number 59,366; R\u00e1jputs, 60,398; Gosains, 2616; Bh\u00e1ts, 1680; Baniy\u00e1s, 22,864; and K\u00e1yasths, 11,282. The lower or S\u00fadra castes, who form the bulk of the population, include the following:\u2014K\u00farm\u00ed, the principal agricultural class, and most numerous caste in the District, 103,958; Cham\u00e1r, 85,481; Kachh\u00ed, 59,058; Ah\u00edr, 65,216; Kah\u00e1r, 34,965; Kori, 22,771; Tel\u00ed, 21,943; Dhob\u00ed, 17,232; P\u00e1sl, 17,186; Gadari\u00e1, 16,662; Barh\u00e1i, 16,067; Bhurj\u00ed, 14,361; N\u00e1i, 14,334; Dhanuk, 11,633; Loh\u00e1r, 10,069; Kumbh\u00e1r, 8993; Bhang\u00ed, 7228; Kalw\u00e1r, 6915; Son\u00e1r, 5185; G\u00fajar, 3163; Loniy\u00e1, 2877; Lodh\u00ed, 2413; Kathik, 2221; Tambul\u00ed, 1940; and M\u00e1l\u00ed, 1845.\n\nOf the Muhammadans, only 181 are recorded as Shi\u00e1s by sect in the Census Report, the remainder being all Sunnis. Classified by race, as distinguished from religion, the Musalm\u00e1ns consist of three classes\u2014Milk\u00eds, so called because their ancestors were the class to whom principally milks or revenue-free grants of lands were given by the Muhammadan rulers of the country. They are sub-divided into Sayyids and Shaikhs, and are reputed to be the descendants of Arabs. The Path\u00e1ns or Afgh\u00e1ns, and the Mughals, are descended from immigrants into India from beyond the north-west. The Indian Muhammadans, or descendants of converts from Hinduism, include 677 R\u00e1jputs and Mewat\u00eds by descent. In the khadd\u00e1r of the Ganges, in Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d tahsil, a peculiar class of Musalm\u00e1ns called Pankhias are found in small isolated hamlets. These profess to be strict Muhammadans, but transgress the law of Isl\u00e1m by eating turtles, crocodiles, and other animals usually regarded as forbidden food. They appear to be a fairly well-to-do cultivating class, and their hamlets\nshow a stock of cattle, goats, and poultry much larger than that possessed by ordinary Hindu cultivators.\n\nThe Christian population consists of\u2014Europeans, 942; Eurasians, 6; and natives, 460. The different sects include the Churches of England and Rome, Presbyterians, Baptists, Methodists, and Wesleyans. The American Baptist Mission has had a station at Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur since 1859, with several schools for boys and girls in the city, one teaching up to the university entrance standard. There is also a Christian village at Pan\u00e1pur, 10 miles east of the city, connected with a boys' orphanage under charge of the Mission, comprising about 900 acres of land laid out in small farms and cultivated by about 300 native Christians. The children of the orphanage are fed, clothed, educated, and instructed in various trades by the Mission, which receives a Government grant-in-aid of \u00a325 a month. The Mission altogether maintains 26 day schools in the District, 18 for girls, and 8 for boys, attended in 1882 by 303 girls and 627 boys.\n\nUrban and Rural Population.\u2014Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur contains six towns with more than five thousand inhabitants, namely, SHAHJAHANPUR, population (1881) 74,830; TILHAR, 15,351; JALALABAD, 8025; KHUDAGANJ, 6925; MIRANPUR KATRA, 5949; and PAWAYAN, 5478. The urban population thus disclosed amounts to 116,558, or 13\u00b76 per cent. of the District population, leaving 740,388, or 86\u00b740 per cent., as forming the rural population. The only two municipal towns, however, are Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur and Tilh\u00e1r. Total municipal income (1883\u201384), \u00a37316, of which \u00a35818 was derived from taxation in the shape of octroi duties; average incidence of taxation, 1s. 3d. per head of the population (92,963) within municipal limits. The police and conservancy arrangements of the other towns is provided for by a small house-tax levied under the provisions of Act xx. of 1856. Of the 2020 minor villages, 829 contain less than two hundred inhabitants; 754 between two hundred and five hundred; 322 between five hundred and a thousand; 97 between one thousand and two thousand; 13 between two thousand and three thousand; and five between three thousand and five thousand.\n\nMaterial Condition of the People.\u2014In the central portion of the District, the people are well off, and inhabit a richly cultivated plain, scarcely inferior to that of the Do\u00e1b. In the extreme north, however, agriculture is backward, waste tracts are numerous, and the people are poor and miserable like their neighbours in the tar\u00e1i. In the south, also, where the swampy tract between the R\u00e1mgang\u00e1 and the Ganges alternates with stretches of stiff clay, the condition of the agricultural classes is much less prosperous. The best class of houses in towns rarely cost more than \u00a3200; the common huts of the peasantry, about \u00a31. The latter consist merely of mud walls roofed with thatch.\nAs regards occupation, the Census Report of 1881 distributes the total male population among six great classes. The first or professional class numbers 7803, including 4372 engaged in the general government, 1228 in military defence, and 2203 in the learned professions or in literature. The second or domestic class numbers 1931, and comprises all males employed as private servants, washermen, water-carriers, barbers, sweepers, innkeepers, etc. The third or commercial class numbers 7588, and includes all persons who buy or sell, or keep or lend money or goods, such as bankers, money-lenders, brokers, shopkeepers, etc., 2338; and persons engaged in the carriage of men or goods, such as pack-carriers, carters, etc., 5250. Of the fourth or agricultural class, besides the 225,509 males engaged in agriculture, the Census returns show 1270 persons engaged about animals, such as shepherds, etc., making a total of 226,779. The fifth or industrial class numbers 41,030, including all persons engaged in industrial arts and mechanics, such as dyers, masons, carpenters, perfumers, etc., 3016; those engaged in textile manufactures, such as weavers, tailors, cotton-cleaners, etc., 18,456; preparers of articles of food or drink, such as grain-parchers, confectioners, cooks, etc., 9840; and dealers in all animal, vegetable, or mineral substances, 9718. The sixth or indefinite class numbers 174,933, comprising all general labourers, 21,050; and persons of independent means, male children, and unspecified, 153,883.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014The course of tillage follows the ordinary rule of the North-Western Provinces, consisting of the kharif or autumn harvest\u2014chief staples, cotton, rice, b\u00e1jra, and jo\u00e1r; and the rab\u00ed or spring harvest, including wheat, barley, oats, vetch, and peas. Sugar-cane is grown in the low-lying lands, and Indian corn on ground capable of bearing two crops a year. Of the total District area of 1745\u00b77 square miles, 1089\u00b76 square miles were returned in 1883\u201384 as under cultivation, 463\u00b77 square miles were available for cultivation, 173\u00b75 square miles were uncultivable waste, while 18\u00b79 square miles were non-assessed or held revenue-free. The total crop area in 1883\u201384 (including lands bearing two harvests in the year) was returned at 730,819 acres, as follows:\u2014Rab\u00ed\u2014wheat and barley, 290,933 acres; pulses, 44,170 acres; oil-seeds, 516 acres; miscellaneous, 12,194 acres. Kharif\u2014rice, 96,241 acres; millets, 152,977 acres; cotton, 2665 acres; oil-seeds, 1582 acres; miscellaneous, 88,578 acres. The crops belonging to neither season were\u2014sugar-cane, 38,509 acres; and vegetables, 2454 acres.\n\nThere are no irrigation canals in Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur, nor does there appear any need for them, as the rainfall is copious, and the water level only from 12 to 15 feet below the surface. Irrigation is abundantly furnished by wells, tanks, ponds, and the damming up of the minor rivers and streams. In 1883\u201384, the area thus irrigated was\nreturned at 229,807 acres. Manure is employed where obtainable, but the poverty of the cultivators seldom permits them to let their land lie fallow. The land tenures belong to the standard types of the Province. The country, however, has been too recently occupied to have acquired such complicated holdings or undergone such minute sub-division as in the Lower Do\u00e1b. The horned cattle of the District are small and weak, and good draught oxen can only be obtained by importation from beyond the Ganges. Government has made several attempts to improve the breed, but the people show no disposition to avail themselves of the facilities offered to them.\n\n**Land Tenures, Rent, etc.**\u2014At the time of the settlement of the District, out of a total of 3063 revenue-paying estates in Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur, 2191 were held under zamind\u00e1ri, and 872 under pattid\u00e1ri tenure. The area alienated in perpetuity in rent-free grants of land, made by the zam\u00ednd\u00e1r proprietors, amounted to 11,712 acres, or a little over 1 per cent. of the total area. Cultivating tenures are divided into the two primary classes of proprietary and non-proprietary holdings. The fields cultivated by proprietors are called sir or homestead lands. The non-proprietary cultivators are either tenants with a right of occupancy, or tenants-at-will. Under the operation of the present rent-law, tenants-at-will are always on the way to acquiring the status of privileged tenants with rights of occupancy; the only qualification necessary being continuous cultivation of the same lands (other than sir lands) for twelve years. At the time of settlement, the proprietors held themselves 13\u00b742 per cent. of the cultivated area as sir land; occupancy tenants, 61\u00b731 per cent.; and tenants-at-will, 25\u00b727 per cent. One reason for the large proportion of occupancy tenants is said to be the universal prevalence of money rents all over the District, except in the worst parts of Paw\u00e1yan and Khut\u00e1r parg\u00e1ns.\n\nThe total male adult agricultural population in Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur District in 1881 was returned at 225,509, made up as follows:\u2014Landed proprietors, 8468; estate servants and agents, 1047; tenant cultivators, 178,352; and agricultural labourers, 37,642. The population entirely dependent on the soil, however, numbered 622,593, or 72\u00b765 per cent. of that of the whole District. Average area cultivated by each male adult agriculturist, 3\u00b713 acres. Total Government assessment, including local rates and cesses levied upon the land, \u00a3139,760, or an average of 4s. per cultivated acre. Rental paid by cultivators, including cesses, \u00a3219,868, or an average of 6s. 2\u00bdd. per cultivated acre. Custom, rather than competition, has regulated the rates of rent in this District, and the higher rates are still much the same as they were in 1818. The lower rates, however, were enhanced at the time of settlement by an average of 6\u00bd per cent. The following is a statement of the maximum and minimum rates prevailing for each of the six\nprincipal classes of land:\u2014Homestead (gauh\u00e1n\u00ed) land, from 7s. 6d. to 16s. an acre; first-class loam (domat), from 4s. 6d. to 10s. an acre; second-class loam, from 3s. to 7s. 6d. an acre; clay (matiy\u00e1r), 3s. 6d. to 8s. an acre; sand (bh\u00edr), from 2s. 3d. to 5s. an acre; and hard clay (dh\u00e1nkar and kh\u00e1pat), from 2s. 3d. to 5s. an acre. Rates of rent are determined quite as much by the respectability of the tenant as by the quality of the soil, the lowest rates being paid by Br\u00e1hmans, R\u00e1jputs, and high-class Muhammadans; and the highest by the lower castes of Hindus and inferior orders of Muhammadans.\n\nThe following statement of the prices per cwt. of agricultural produce for the three years 1861, 1871, and 1881, which may be regarded as normal years, shows the steady advance in prices which has been made of late years\u2014Wheat, 1861, 3s. 1\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\)d.; 1871, 4s.; and 1881, 5s. 4d. per cwt. Barley, 1861, 2s. 7d.; 1871, 3s. 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)d.; and 1881, 4s. 1d. per cwt. B\u00e1jra, 1861, 2s. 10\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)d.; 1871, 3s. 11\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)d.; and 1881, 4s. 7d. per cwt. Jo\u00e1r, 1861, 2s. 9d.; 1871, 3s. 11\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)d.; and 1881, 4s. 3d. per cwt. Common rice, 1861, 4s. 11d.; 1871, 5s. 11d.; and 1881, 7s. 2d. per cwt. Best rice, 1861, 8s. 5d.; 1871, 18s. 8d.; and 1881, 15s. per cwt. Wages have risen in proportion. Coolies and agricultural labourers who were paid from 2d. to 2\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\)d. a day in 1858, received from 3d. to 3\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)d. in 1882; while the wages of skilled labourers, such as smiths, carpenters, and masons, have risen from 4\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)d. to 6d. and upwards a day, in the same period.\n\n**Natural Calamities.**\u2014Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur suffers from drought and famine, though its proximity to the hills sometimes saves it from the worst extremities to which neighbouring Districts are exposed. The great famine of 1783\u201384, though severely felt in Roh\u00edlkhand, did not press so heavily upon this Division as upon Agra and the south-west. In 1803\u201304, two years after the cession, rain completely failed for the autumn crops. In 1825\u201326, drought again occurred, but did not bring about famine in the strictest sense. In 1837\u201338, the autumn rains failed, but a slight fall in February saved the harvest in part, though great dearth of grain ensued. The famine of 1860\u201361 was severely felt throughout Roh\u00edlkhand, and Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur suffered like its neighbours, though it escaped the extreme misery which fell upon the contiguous District of Bud\u00e1un. In the famine of 1868\u201369, Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur escaped lightly, although during the period of pressure, lasting for seven weeks, the suffering was extremely severe.\n\nPerhaps the District suffered more severely in the famine of 1877\u201379 than on any previous occasion in the present century. A series of bad harvests had followed the previous scarcity of 1868\u201369, and the heavy demands by the beginning of 1877 for the export of grain to Southern India caused such a depletion of stocks, as to convert what would otherwise have been a severe scarcity into actual\nfamine. On the 7th August 1877, the Collector reported 'roaring hot winds, and not a vestige of green anywhere.' Although a little rain fell towards the end of August, prices of grain had risen beyond the purchasing power of the poorest class early in September; and the kharif or autumn harvest was a total failure. A timely fall of rain, however, early in October enabled the sowings for the rabi or spring crops to be made, the requisite seed corn being provided by Government, while small money loans were arranged for from the mahidjans through the tahsildars in the interior of the District, on the security of the landholders. By December the spring sowings were over, and relief works were started, in the shape of earthwork and the collection of road materials for those able to labour, and a poorhouse for the helpless and infirm, while high-caste women who do not appear in public received assistance in their own homes. But the cultivating classes generally declined to submit to what they deemed the indignity of road-work, and preferred living as best they could on wild pot-herbs (s\u00e1g), which they could gather in the neighbourhood of their own homes, to earning the wages offered on the works. For artisans and labourers in the city, work was provided by the municipality. The consequence of this entire substitution of green food for the ordinary coarse grains consumed by the peasantry was that their strength failed, and they succumbed in large numbers to the cold at the end of December and beginning of January.\n\nThe rabi harvest in 1878 was generally fair, notwithstanding some partial loss from hailstorms and superabundance of moisture; and the high prices prevailing did much to recoup the cultivators. But the condition of the day-labourers still caused grave anxiety. The autumn rains, although delayed, fell in sufficient abundance to ensure the prospects of the ensuing kharif harvest; and relief works were closed by the middle of November, and the poorhouses by the end of December 1878. The mortality caused by the famine was very heavy; 60,659 deaths are reported to have occurred between November 1877 and October 1878. The after effects of famine, in the deterioration of the strength of the people, were terribly illustrated in the fever epidemic which raged during 1879 and part of 1880. The registered death-rate, which stood at 29\u00b737 per thousand in 1877, rose to 57\u00b704 per thousand in 1878, and to 53\u00b759 per thousand in 1879, falling again to 34\u00b730 per thousand in 1880.\n\nCommerce and Trade, etc.\u2014The Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway is the main channel for the commerce of Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur. It enters the District near Kaheli\u00e1, and leaves it near Fatehganj, after a course of 39 miles within its limits. There are stations at Kaheli\u00e1, Rosa Junction, Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur, Tilh\u00e1r, and Miranpur Katra. Four metalled roads also form great arteries of traffic, namely, the Rohilkhand Trunk\nRoad; the road from Paw\u00e1yan through Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur to Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d; from Lucknow to Bareilly via Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur and Tilh\u00e1r; and from Fatehgarh through Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d to Miranpur Katra. Total length of roads, 337 miles. Cereals and pulses are carried down the R\u00e1mgang\u00e1 by Cawnpur traders, who send their boats to Kolagh\u00e1t, near Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d. Grain and raw sugar are conveyed on the Deoha from Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur. Some through traffic exists from Pilibhit, where boats are built and despatched down stream, laden with produce. A considerable quantity of timber is also floated down from Pilibhit. Sugar is largely manufactured, and forms the chief export of the District. It formerly went by cart to Agra and other trans-Jumna marts, salt and cotton being imported in return; but most of this traffic now finds an outlet by the railway, which also conveys the cotton from Chandaus\u00ed, the chief market for that staple in Rohilkhand. European goods, metals, and salt form the main items of import trade. The principal manufacture under European superintendence is that of sugar, started thirty years ago at the Rosa factory, near Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur, by Messrs. Carew & Co. The factory was destroyed during the Mutiny, but was restored, and has been continued ever since. Rum is also distilled here, and largely sold to the Commissariat Department. The works are connected with the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway by a short branch line 3\u00bd miles long, and are capable of turning out 600,000 gallons of rum, and 120,000 maunds of sugar. The still-head duty due to Government on rum sold to the public (exclusive of that supplied to the Commissariat Department) amounts to nearly \u00a330,000 a year.\n\nAdministration.\u2014Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur is the seat of a Civil and Sessions Judge, whose civil jurisdiction extends also over the adjoining District of Bud\u00e1un. He holds criminal sessions at Bud\u00e1un town alternately with the Judge of Bareilly. The District staff comprises a Collector-Magistrate, Joint Magistrate, Assistant Magistrate, and uncovenanted Deputy Magistrate, besides a sub-deputy opium agent, and the usual fiscal, medical, and constabulary officials. The total amount of revenue\u2014imperial, municipal, and local\u2014raised in the District in 1876 amounted to \u00a3191,508, or 3s. 10\u00bdd. per head of the population. Of this sum, the land-tax contributed \u00a3118,442. In 1883\u201384, the total revenue of the District amounted to \u00a3186,162, of which the principal items were\u2014Land revenue, \u00a3118,637; stamps, \u00a313,786; excise, \u00a332,807; provincial rates, \u00a314,149; assessed taxes, \u00a32356; registration, \u00a3753. The total cost of civil administration, as represented by the pay of officials and police, in 1883\u201384, was \u00a331,821. Number of civil judges, 13; number of magistrates, 30. In 1883 the regular and town police force consisted of 648 officers and men, maintained at a total cost of \u00a36635. There is also a village watch or rural police (chaukid\u00e1rs) numbering 2081 in vol. xii.\n1883, maintained at a cost of \u00a37518. The total machinery, therefore, for the protection of person and property consisted of 2729 officers and men, giving one man to every '6 square mile of area, or to every 314 of the population. Total cost, \u00a314,153, equal to an average of \u00a38, 2s. 1\u00bdd. per square mile of area, or 3\u00bdd. per head of population. The District jail at Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur contained during the same year a daily average of 320 prisoners, of whom 15 were females. Postal communication is carried on by 9 imperial and 10 local post-offices; and the telegraph is in operation at all the stations on the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway.\n\nThe educational returns in 1883 showed a total of 140 Government aided and inspected schools, with a roll of 4563 pupils. This is exclusive of unaided and uninspected schools. The Census Report of 1881 returned 5922 boys and 136 girls as under instruction, besides 17,080 males and 317 females able to read and write but not under instruction. The schools conducted by the American Baptist Mission have been already alluded to in a previous section of this article.\n\nFor fiscal and administrative purposes, the District is sub-divided into 4 tahsils and 12 pargan\u00e1s.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate of Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur is much damper than that of the Upper Do\u00e1b, and somewhat more so than the other portions of the Rohilkhand plain. Six weeks seldom pass at any time of the year without a fall of rain; and the prevailing wind sets easterly from the cloudy summits of the Him\u00e1layas. The heat during the hot months does not equal that of the neighbouring Districts, and excessively hot winds seldom blow for more than five or six days in each year. Except in May and June, the country has a fresh and green aspect, very unlike the parched brown stretches of the Do\u00e1b. The average rainfall for 32 years ending 1881 amounted to 38\u00b741 inches, the maximum during that period being 54\u00b75 inches in 1867, and the minimum 18\u00b73 inches in 1868. From January to May, the average fall is 3\u00b738 inches; from June to September, 33\u00b741 inches; from October to December, 16\u00b72 inches. The mean annual temperature is said to be about 75\u00b0 F., but no accurate thermometrical returns are available. Except in the extreme north, near the tar\u00e1i, the climate generally is healthy; but fevers prevail in that portion of the District every spring and autumn. The valley of the Sot is also very malarious. The total number of deaths reported in 1883 was 28,126, or 32\u00b771 per thousand, as against an average of 46\u00b758 per thousand for the previous five years. The mortality caused by the epidemic fever of 1879 and 1880 following on the famine of 1878, has been already alluded to. The District contains six charitable dispensaries\u2014at Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur, Katra, Gularia, Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d, Tilh\u00e1r, and Paw\u00e1yan. In 1883 they afforded relief to\n32,205 persons, of whom 1167 were in-door patients.

Currie, Esq., C.S.; the Census Report of the North-Western Provinces for 1881; and the several annual Administration and Departmental Reports of the Provincial Government.]\n\nSh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur. \u2014 South-eastern tahsil of Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur District, North-Western Provinces, comprising the three pargan\u00e1s of Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur, Jamaur, and K\u00e1nt. The Garra river forms the boundary between Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur and Jamaur pargan\u00e1s, the latter lying between the Garra river and the Garai n\u00e1la, which last separates it from K\u00e1nt pargan\u00e1. Throughout Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur pargan\u00e1, the surface of the country is level, except where it is broken by the Khanaut river; and the soil is a good loam called dumat. Well irrigation is ordinarily needed, but the soil retains moisture well, and one watering is usually sufficient for wheat. Jamaur pargan\u00e1, with the exception of a narrow strip of dumat along the right bank of the Garra, lies low and is composed of a hard clay soil, requiring constant irrigation for the spring crops. K\u00e1nt pargan\u00e1, with the exception of the valley of the Garai, is composed of a light sandy soil, which, though not equal in productiveness to the dumat of Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur pargan\u00e1, nevertheless retains moisture well, and produces fair crops in ordinary years without the necessity of any extensive irrigation.\n\nArea, 401 square miles. Population (1881) 252,028, namely, males 133,206, and females 118,822. Average density of population, 628'5 persons per square mile. Hindus, 192,487; Muhammadans, 58,113; Christians, 1362; and 'others,' 66. Of the 467 towns and villages in the tahsil, 359 contain less than five hundred inhabitants; 80 between five hundred and a thousand; and 27 between one thousand and five thousand. The only place with upwards of five thousand is Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur city. Area assessed for Government revenue, 392 square miles, namely, 242 square miles cultivated, 108 square miles cultivable, and 42 square miles uncultivable waste. Total Government land revenue, \u00a329,062, or including local rates and cesses, \u00a332,602. Total rental paid by cultivators, including cesses, \u00a361,262. The chief tenure is zam\u00ednd\u00e1ri, but there is not a single large proprietor in the tahsil. In 1884, Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur tahsil contained (including the District head-quarter courts) 3 civil and 10 criminal courts, with a regular police force of 357 officers and men.\n\nSh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur. \u2014 Chief town, municipality, and administrative head-quarters of Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur District, North-Western Provinces; situated in lat. 27\u00b0 53' 41\" N., and long. 79\u00b0 57' 30\" E.; on the left\nbank of the river Deoha or Garra, crowning the high ground just above its junction with the Khanaut. An old fort overhangs the confluence; and a large masonry bridge, built by Hak\u00edm Mehnd\u00ed Al\u00ed, spans the smaller river. The city was founded in 1647, during the reign of the Emperor Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n, whose name it bears, by Naw\u00e1b Bah\u00e1dur Kh\u00e1n, a Path\u00e1n. There is nothing of any special note in the history of the city, apart from that of the District generally, during the 210 years which elapsed between its foundation and 1857, when it became the scene of open rebellion during the Mutiny. The incidents of 1857 and 1858 are described in sufficient detail in the historical section of the District article (q.v.).\n\nPopulation (1872) 72,140; (1881) 77,936, namely, males 39,293, and females 38,643. Hindus number 37,811; Muhammadans, 39,080; Christians, 979; and \u2018others,\u2019 66. Number of houses, 13,776. Municipal income (1883-84), \u00a36372, of which \u00a35184 was derived from taxation in the shape of octroi duties; average incidence of taxation, 1s. 4d. per head. Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur is a station on the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway, and is also connected by good roads with Lucknow, Bareilly, Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d, Pilibh\u00edt, Muhamdi, and Hardoi. The main street runs from near the old fort for a distance of about 1\u00be mile through the heart of the city to Bah\u00e1durganj market, near its northern limits. From Bah\u00e1durganj, the city extends outside the cantonments for fully a mile, crossing the road to Bareilly and stretching out along the Pilibh\u00edt road. In the opposite direction to the south-east, it extends across the Khanaut stream, near Hak\u00edm Mehnd\u00ed\u2019s bridge. From north to south, the extreme length of the city is upwards of four miles, while the breadth is seldom more than one mile, and generally less. The population is only dense in certain quarters, and patches of cultivated land and gardens of fruit-trees are found everywhere.\n\nThe tahs\u00edli courts, police station, and the dispensary are situated in the centre of the city, in the main street. The police lines, jail, and high school are on the edge of the city, overlooking the valley of the Khanaut. Farther north are the District, civil, criminal, and revenue courts. The civil lines consist of a small piece of land bounded on three sides by the cantonment, and on the fourth by the native city; but the house accommodation is said to be insufficient for the requirements of the civil residents. Before the Mutiny, native troops only were stationed at Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur. The military force now consists of a wing of a European and a wing of a native infantry regiment. The barracks, built after the Mutiny, are comfortable and well-constructed buildings. The station contains an English church, and three churches for native converts maintained by the American Methodist Mission, which also supports one large and several small schools for boys and\ngirls, an orphanage, and a dispensary. In addition to the high school and mission school, the town contains a Government tahsili school, and a municipal free school.\n\nSh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur, taking its population into consideration, is a city of comparatively little commercial importance. The only local manufacture is sugar, which, with cereals and pulses, forms the principal export. The Rosa sugar factory and rum distillery is situated on the Garra river, a few miles from the city, with which it is connected by a short branch of the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway. The three principal markets in the city are Bah\u00e1durganj, near the cantonment and civil station; Carewganj, at the other or southern end; and a new vegetable market in the centre of the town, constructed in 1878-79 by the municipality.\n\nSh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur.\u2014Town in Gwalior State, Central India; situated on the Bombay-Agra Trunk Road between Guna (Goona) and Indore, 106 miles from the former, and 60 miles from the latter town. Headquarters of the Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur District of Gwalior. Population (1881) 9247, namely, Hindus, 7168; Muhammadans, 2064; and 'others,' 15.\n\nShah-ki-dheri.\u2014Village and ruins in R\u00e1wal Pindi District, Punjab. \u2014See Deri Shahan.\n\nSh\u00e1hlimar.\u2014Gardens and pleasure-ground in Lahore District, Punjab, 4 miles east of Lahore city.\u2014See Shalamar.\n\nSh\u00e1hpur.\u2014A British District in the Punjab, lying between 31\u00b0 32' and 32\u00b0 42' N. lat., and between 71\u00b0 37' and 73\u00b0 24' E. long. Area, 4691 square miles. Population (1881) 421,508 souls. Sh\u00e1hpur forms the southernmost District of the R\u00e1wal Pindi Division. It is bounded on the north by the Pind D\u00e1dan Kh\u00e1n and Tal\u00e1gang tahsils of Jehlam (Jhelum) District; on the east by Gujr\u00e1t and Gujr\u00e1nw\u00e1la Districts, the Chen\u00e1b river marking the boundary for a portion of the distance; on the south by Jhang District; and on the west by Dera Ism\u00e1il Kh\u00e1n and Bannu Districts. Sh\u00e1hpur is divided into three tahsils\u2014Bher\u00e1 in the east and Sh\u00e1hpur in the west, forming the cis-Jehlam portion of the District; and Khush\u00e1b, the trans-Jehlam tract. The District stands seventh in order of area, and twenty-fourth in order of population, among the 32 Districts of the Punjab, and comprises 4\u00b740 per cent. of the total area, and 2\u00b723 per cent. of the total population, of the Province. The administrative head-quarters are at the small town of Sh\u00e1hpur on the Jehlam river, but Bher\u00e1 is the largest place in the District.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The District of Sh\u00e1hpur consists of an irregular block of country, artificially demarcated for administrative purposes, and stretching from the western bank of the Chen\u00e1b, across the valley of the Jehlam, far into the heart of the Sind S\u00e1g\u00e1r Do\u00e1b, and up to the centre of the Salt Range. On either side of the Jehlam, which\ndivides the District into two nearly equal portions, lie wide upland plains, utterly barren or covered only with coarse low brushwood. Much, however, of this area is composed of good soil only requiring irrigation to make it productive of fine crops; indeed, excepting the *thal* or barren sandy tract of the Sind S\u00e1gar Do\u00e1b, there is little land that would not repay the labour of the husbandman could he but procure water at a moderate cost. As it is, however, about 83 per cent. of the area still remains untouched by the hand of man; while in the southern half of the District, cultivation is for the most part confined to a strip of land varying from three to fifteen miles in width along the banks of the Jehlam and Chen\u00e1b rivers.\n\nBut although so large a portion of the surface consists of native prairie, considerable variety exists in the aspect of the country. Beginning from the south-eastern border, the first well-marked natural tract comprises the lowlands of the Chen\u00e1b, where percolation from the river spreads fertility over a long belt about 10 or 12 miles in width, along the whole of its course. Above these fruitful and well-watered levels, the *b\u00e1r* or central table-land of the Jetch Do\u00e1b stretches in a monotonous undulating waste of desert or jungle to the valley of the Jehlam. The soil of this upland is naturally good; but the impossibility of obtaining water precludes all hope of cultivation, except in a few hollow basins, where the crops depend upon the capricious rainfall for their whole supply. Population is scanty; villages are few, and separated from each other by great distances. Numerous herds of cattle, however, roam at will over the prairie jungles, and obtain abundant pasturage from the luxuriant carpet of grass which covers the surface after the rains.\n\nA second zone of cultivation fringes either bank of the Jehlam, though not extending so far inland as on the Chen\u00e1b. The lowland strips on both sides of the Jetch Do\u00e1b are popularly divided into the *hitar*, or alluvial tract immediately bordering the river, and the *nakka*, or slope just beyond the range of percolation. The former contains the most prosperous villages, and is covered throughout its entire length by one unbroken sheet of grain for the *rabi* or spring harvest, without the necessity for artificial irrigation; the latter depends upon the water-supply from wells, and has smaller and more straggling villages scattered at wide distances from one another.\n\nBeyond the Jehlam valley rises a second table-land, the *thal* of the Sind S\u00e1gar Do\u00e1b, a far more forbidding and desert expanse than the *b\u00e1r*. Northward, a hard level plain, impregnated in places with salt, and almost devoid of vegetation, stretches away monotonously to the foot of the Salt Range. To the east and south, a sandy plateau runs onward till it merges in the utter desert of Dera Ism\u00e1il Kh\u00e1n. The extreme southern portion resembles an angry sea of sand, tossed into\nwave-like hillocks, between which lie undulating troughs of short coarse grass.\n\nThe north of Sh\u00e1hpur District is occupied by a part of the Salt Range, which runs right across the Do\u00e1b, and rises to its greatest height in Mount Sakeswar, 5000 feet above sea-level. It consists of two divergent chains, which unite again at either end, and enclose a number of rock-bound alluvial basins, interspersed with picturesque lakes. Little patches of rich cultivation are found amid the nooks and valleys of the range, rendered fruitful by the fresh alluvial detritus from the surrounding peaks, and watered by the comparatively abundant rainfall of the hill tract. The southern face of the range presents a bold mass of broken and rugged cliffs, whose distorted strata and huge detached rocks give an air of sublimity to the scenery. Many torrents flow through the gorges on its side, and spread fertility over a narrow strip of lowland at the base, known as the moh\u00e1r. Thence an intermediate belt of pasture land, the danda, leads on imperceptibly to the wild sandy waste of the thal.\n\nThe Jehlam (Jhelum) river traverses the District throughout its entire length from north to south. In Sh\u00e1hpur it is a muddy river, with a current of about 4 miles an hour; average width of the stream in times of flood, about 800 yards, dwindling down in the winter months to less than half this width. A remarkable feature of this river is the sudden freshets to which it is subject. These occur after very heavy rain in the hills, when the swollen stream, overflowing its banks, inundates the country for miles on either side for a day or two, and then gradually subsides within its normal bounds, leaving the soil enriched with a valuable alluvial deposit. The Chen\u00e1b, which forms the boundary between Sh\u00e1hpur and Gujr\u00e1nw\u00e1la for 25 miles, has a greater volume of water than the Jehlam, but its current is more sluggish, and though impetuous in flood, the average velocity does not exceed 2\u00bd miles an hour. The flood deposits of the Chen\u00e1b are inferior in richness and in quantity to those of the Jehlam.\n\nA characteristic feature of Sh\u00e1hpur District is its system of inundation canals. The remains of ancient cuttings are met with along the edge of the b\u00e1r tract; but these had been allowed to fall into disuse, and have long since silted up. In 1860, one of the channels was experimentally cleared out by the District officer, and the success of the trial induced an enterprising native gentleman to excavate an entirely new canal to irrigate a grant of waste land of which he had obtained a lease. This work was completely successful; and since 1860, twenty-six inundation canals have been constructed for irrigation purposes, of which six are Government works, aggregating 115 miles in length, and irrigating 33,700 acres; and 20 are private canals, with a total length of 235\u00bd miles, and irrigating 43,628 acres.\nForest Conservancy.\u2014Although Sh\u00e1hpur District contains no large forest trees, it is scantily wooded in parts with ordinary timber and shrubs suitable for fuel and other purposes. In the Khush\u00e1b tahsil of the Salt Range tract, 31 rakhs with an area of 134,824 acres have been placed under the control of the Forest Department, besides 35 other rakhs with an area of 142,920 acres in Bher\u00e1 tahsil in the elevated b\u00e1r lands between the Jehlam and Chen\u00e1b rivers. The predominating trees and shrubs met with in the Salt Range rakhs are sanatha (Dodon\u00e6a viscosa), bahikar (Adhatoda Vasica), phataki (Celastrus spinosus), phulahi (Acacia modesta), kau or olive (Olea ferruginea), occasional specimens of shisham or sissu (Dalbergia Sissoo), kikar (Acacia arabica), and dh\u00e1k (Butea frondosa). In favourable localities, such as the summits of some of the higher peaks, many other species are found, such as kangar (Pistacia integerrima), kalar (Bauhinia variegata), kamlai (Odina Wodier), dhamman (Grewia oppositifolia), an\u00e1r or pomegranate (Punica Granatum), lah\u00fara (Tecoma undulata), papri or box (Buxus sempervirens), khaj\u00far or wild date-palm (Phoenix sylvestris), kil\u00fa (Cham\u00e6rops Ritchieana), b\u00e1ns or bamboo (Dendrocalamus strictus). As yet no forest settlement has been effected, and hitherto the work of the Department has been purely protective. A few village communities in the Salt Range enjoy the privilege of pasturing cattle and collecting dry wood in the rakhs, while the general proprietary right belongs to Government. The Government rights in the rakhs of the b\u00e1r tract in Bher\u00e1 tahsil are absolute. These rakhs produce pasture and wood fuel, consisting chiefly of jh\u00e1nd (Prosopis spicigera), karil (Capparis aphylla), mula (Spatholobus Roxburghii), and v\u00e1ni (Salvadora oleoides). As yet no wood has been felled, but the pasturage is annually leased to contractors, yielding a revenue of \u00a32250.\n\nMinerals.\u2014Salt is found throughout the hills which derive their name from this mineral, concealed in the red marl which gives to the range one of its most characteristic features. The salt is exceedingly pure, and as the average thickness of the beds is probably not less than 150 feet, the supply appears to be inexhaustible. The salt workings are mainly situated in Jehlam District, and only one mine is worked in Sh\u00e1hpur, at W\u00e1rcha. This mine is a large cave, supported by pillars at irregular intervals. The seam worked is 20 feet thick. The out-turn from the mine in 1883\u201384 was 190,987 maunds, or 6991 tons; average out-turn for the four years ending 1883\u201384, 146,914 maunds, or 5378 tons. The duty realized in 1883\u201384 amounted to \u00a337,066, against an average of \u00a332,334 for the four years. The miners are paid at the rate of 7s. 6d. per 100 maunds of salt excavated by them. The annual cost of the mine and guarding establishment amounts to about \u00a32100 a year.\nThe other mineral products of Sh\u00e1hpur are saltpetre, the manufacture of which received a great impulse at the time of the Crimean War, but has now almost dwindled away. Lignite, iron, and lead are found in the Salt Range, but in too small quantities to be practically useful. Gypsum and mica are also found in considerable quantities in the same hills.\n\n*Fera Natura.*\u2014Tigers, leopards, and wolves are found in the Salt Range; while in the b\u00e1r and flat country generally, are found quail, partridges, sand-grouse, hare, bustard, antelope, wild geese, and ducks. In the hilly tract, the *uri\u00e1l* or wild sheep, and the *chikor* or hill partridge, are found. The lakes of the Salt Range are the favourite abodes of the scarlet flamingo. Snakes are common in all parts of the District.\n\n*History.*\u2014Though little definite information can be recovered with regard to the annals of Sh\u00e1hpur District prior to the decline of the Mughal dynasty, the numerous remains studded about the b\u00e1r clearly prove that at some remote period the whole country between the Chen\u00e1b and the Jehlam consisted of a flourishing and well-watered agricultural plain. Mounds of earth, covered with fragments of brick or pottery, lie scattered over the whole table-land, marking the ancient sites of towns and villages in a tract now only inhabited by half-savage pastoral tribes. The historians of Alexander speak of the country as 'teeming with population;' and local tradition affirms that, so late as the time of Akbar, great prosperity extended over the entire b\u00e1r. The present desert condition of the plateau is no doubt attributable to a gradual subsidence of the water level. There are spots where the brickwork of old wells still existing does not extend more than 25 feet in depth; while now, in the same place, water cannot be obtained within 60 feet of the surface, and even when found is usually so brackish as to be unfit for the use of man or beast.\n\nThe dawn of authentic history in Sh\u00e1hpur extends no further back than the reign of Muhammad Sh\u00e1h, when R\u00e1j\u00e1 Sal\u00e1mat R\u00e1i, a R\u00e1jp\u00fat of the Anand tribe, administered Bhera and the surrounding country; while Khush\u00e1b was managed by Naw\u00e1b Ahmady\u00e1r Kh\u00e1n, and the south-eastern tract along the Chen\u00e1b formed part of the territories under the charge of Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 Kaura Mall, Governor of M\u00falt\u00e1n. At the same time, the *thal* was included among the dominions of the Bal\u00fach families of Dera Ghazi Kh\u00e1n and Dera Ism\u00e1il Kh\u00e1n.\n\nDuring the anarchic period which succeeded the disruption of the Mughal Empire, even this remote region became the scene of Sikh and Afgh\u00e1n incursions. In the year 1757, a force under N\u00far-ud-d\u00edn Bamizai, despatched by Ahmad Sh\u00e1h Dur\u00e1ni, to assist his son Tim\u00far in repelling the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, crossed the Jehlam at Khush\u00e1b, marched up the left bank of the river, and laid waste the three largest towns\nof the District. Bhera and Mi\u00e1ni (Meeanee) rose again from their ruins; but only the foundations of Chak S\u00e1nu now mark its former site. About the same time, by the death of Naw\u00e1b Ahmady\u00e1r Kh\u00e1n, Khush\u00e1b also passed into the hands of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Sal\u00e1mat R\u00e1i. Shortly afterwards, however, Abb\u00e1s Kh\u00e1n, a Khattak, who held Pind D\u00e1dan Kh\u00e1n and the Salt Range for Ahmad Sh\u00e1h, treacherously put the R\u00e1j\u00e1 to death, and seized upon Bhera. But Abb\u00e1s Kh\u00e1n was himself thrown into prison as a revenue defaulter; and Fateh Singh, nephew of Sal\u00e1mat R\u00e1i, then recovered his uncle's dominions.\n\nAfter the final success of the Sikhs against Ahmad Sh\u00e1h in 1763, Chattar Singh, of the Sukarchakia misl or confederacy, overran the whole Salt Range, while the Bhangi chieftains parcelled out among themselves the country between those hills and the Chen\u00e1b. Meanwhile, the Muhammadan rulers of Sahiw\u00e1l, Mitha Tiw\u00e1na, and Khush\u00e1b had assumed independence, and managed, though hard pressed, to resist the encroachments of the Sikhs. The succeeding period was one of constant anarchy, aggressive warfare, and territorial changes among the petty princes of the District, only checked by the gradual rise of Mah\u00e1 Singh, and his son, the great Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 Ranjit Singh. The former made himself master of Mi\u00e1ni in 1783; and the latter succeeded in annexing Bhera in 1803. Six years later, Ranjit Singh turned his arms against the Bal\u00fach chieftains of Sahiw\u00e1l and Khush\u00e1b, whom he overcame by combined force and treachery. At the same time, he swallowed up certain smaller domains in the same neighbourhood; and in 1810, effected the conquest of all the country subject to the Si\u00e1l chiefs of Jhang.\n\nIn 1816, the conqueror turned his attention to the M\u00e1liks of Mitha Tiw\u00e1na. The Muhammadan chief retired to N\u00farpur, in the heart of the thal, hoping that scarcity of water and of supplies might check the Sikh advance. But Ranjit Singh's general sank wells as he marched, so that the Tiw\u00e1nas fled in despair, and wandered about for a time as outcasts. The Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1, however, after annexing their territory, dreaded their energy and influence, and therefore endeavoured to conciliate them by inviting them to Lahore, where he made a liberal provision for their support. On the death of the famous Hari Singh\u2014to whom had been assigned the Tiw\u00e1na estates\u2014at Jamr\u00fad, in 1837, Fateh Kh\u00e1n, the representative of the Tiw\u00e1na family, obtained a grant of the ancestral domains from his patron at court, R\u00e1j\u00e1 Dhi\u00e1n Singh. Thenceforward, M\u00e1lik Fateh Kh\u00e1n took a prominent part in the turbulent politics of the Sikh realm, after the rapidly succeeding deaths of Ranjit Singh, his son, and grandson. Thrown into prison by the opposite faction, after the murder of Dhi\u00e1n Singh, he was released by Lieut. (afterwards Sir Herbert) Edwardes, who sent him to Bannu on the outbreak of the M\u00falt\u00e1n rebellion to relieve Lieut.\nTaylor. Shortly afterwards the Sikh troops mutinied, and Fateh Kh\u00e1n was shot down while boldly challenging the bravest champion of the Sikhs to meet him in single combat. His son and a cousin proved themselves actively loyal during the revolt, and were rewarded for their good service both at this period and after the Mutiny of 1857.\n\nSh\u00e1hpur District passed under direct British rule, with the rest of the Punjab, at the close of the second Sikh war. At the time of annexation, the greater part of the country was peopled only by wild pastoral tribes, without fixed abodes, but moving from place to place in search of grass and water. Under the influence of settled government, they have begun to establish themselves in permanent habitations, to cultivate the soil in all suitable places, and to acquire a feeling of attachment to their regular homes. The Mutiny of 1857 had little influence upon Sh\u00e1hpur. The District remained tranquil; and though the villages of the b\u00e1r gave cause for alarm, no outbreak of sepoys took place, and the wild tribes of the upland did not revolt even when their brethren in the M\u00falt\u00e1n Division took up arms. A body of Tiw\u00e1na horse, levied in the District, did excellent service, and earned for their M\u00e1liks the coveted title of Kh\u00e1n Bah\u00e1dur.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The Census of 1855 was taken over an area so greatly altered by subsequent territorial changes (as the trans-Jehlam tract then lay chiefly within the old District of Leiah) that detailed comparison with later statistics becomes impossible. A rough calculation, however, would appear to show that the general density of population increased 25 per cent. between that date and 1868; and although this increase may be regarded as high, there can be no doubt that the number of inhabitants has grown with great rapidity ever since the annexation. The enumeration of 1868 disclosed a population of 368,288, on an area corresponding to that of the present District. At the last Census in 1881, the population of Sh\u00e1hpur was returned at 421,508, showing an increase of 53,220, or 14\u00b74 per cent., in the thirteen years between 1868 and 1881. Much of the increase is due to immigration from Gujr\u00e1nw\u00e1la, Gujr\u00e1t, and Jhang, owing to the rapid extension of canal irrigation during late years.\n\nThe results of the Census of 1881 may be summarized as follows:\u2014Area of District, 4691 square miles; number of towns 6, and of villages 651; number of houses, 72,084; number of families, 98,905. Total population, 421,508, namely, males 221,676, and females 199,832; proportion of males, 52\u00b76 per cent. Average density of the population, 90 persons per square mile. But though the density of population is thus low, when the desert area is taken into account, the proportion of inhabitants to the cultivable surface is really very high, being upwards of 400 per square mile in the tilled portions of the Salt Range. The cultivable land, indeed, is very much sub-divided,\nand is barely sufficient for the support of its inhabitants. Villages per square mile, 14; persons per village, 642; houses per square mile, 19; persons per house, 5\u00b785. Classified according to sex and age, there were in 1881\u2014under 15 years of age, boys 89,567, and girls 81,194; total children, 170,761, or 40\u00b75 per cent. of the population: 15 years and upwards, males 132,109, and females 118,638; total adults, 250,747, or 59\u00b75 per cent.\n\nReligion.\u2014Classified according to religion, the Muhammadans form the great bulk of the population, being returned at 357,742, or 84\u00b79 per cent.; Hindus number 50,026; Sikhs, 4702; Christians, 29; and Jains, 9. The principal Muhammadan tribes include\u2014Bal\u00fach\u00eds, 8865; Sayyids, 8625; Shaikhs, 7499; Path\u00e1ns, 3076; and Mughals, 2335. These are Muhammadans by race descent. The following tribes are mainly Muhammadans by conversion of Hindus and aboriginal races in the time of the early Muhammadan invasions, and most of them still contain a proportion of Hindus\u2014R\u00e1jput, 82,290; Awan, 48,485; J\u00e1t, 34,508; Chuhr\u00e1, 28,297; Jul\u00e1ha, 22,472; Much\u00ed, 15,314; Kumbh\u00e1r, 11,769; Machh\u00ed, 11,156; Tarkh\u00e1n, 10,270; Khokhar, 10,265; Arain, 8574; Mir\u00e1si, 8344; Nai, 7541; Dhobi, 5624; Kass\u00e1b, 5202; Loh\u00e1r, 5074; Son\u00e1r, 3597; and Tel\u00ed, 2112. The castes which still remain almost entirely Hindus or Sikhs, are the Br\u00e1hman, 5462; Arora, 35,017; and Khattri, 15,015. The landowning classes and the great mass of the village servants are Muhammadans; the Hindus and Sikhs being almost confined to the mercantile and official classes and their priests. The proportion of Hindus is much greater in towns than in villages. The six towns contain two-fifths of the entire Hindu population of the District, and the remainder are absorbed in the larger villages, since in the smaller ones not a single Hindu is met with, except here and there a petty shopkeeper.\n\nTown and Rural Population.\u2014The following six towns are returned in the Census of 1881\u2014SHAHPUR, the civil head-quarters station of the District, population (1881) 7752; BHERA, 15,165; KHUSHAB, 8989; SHAHIWAL, 8880; MIANI, 8069; and GIROT, 2776. Total urban population, 51,631, or 12\u00b72 per cent. of that of the whole District. These towns are all municipalities, with a total municipal income in 1883\u201384 of \u00a33405, or an average of 1s. 4d. per head. Of the 651 villages or collections of hamlets comprising the rural population, 198 contain less than two hundred inhabitants; 210 between two and five hundred; 144 between five hundred and a thousand; 71 between one and two thousand; 20 between two and three thousand; and 8 between three and five thousand. As regards occupation, the Census of 1881 divided the adult male population of Sh\u00e1hpur into the following seven main classes:\u2014(1) Professional and official class, 4171; (2) domestic and menial class, 4619; (3) commercial class, including merchants, traders,\ncarriers, etc., 5197; (4) agricultural and pastoral class, including gardeners, 60,884; (5) industrial and manufacturing class, including all artisans, 30,635; (6) indefinite and non-productive class, comprising general labourers, 13,972; and (7) unspecified, 12,631.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014The total area under cultivation in 1883-84 amounted to 557,513 acres, of which 336,655 acres were artificially irrigated. Of the remaining area, 796,912 acres in the b\u0101r tract are utilized for grazing purposes; 1,156,890 acres would be cultivable with the assistance of irrigation; while 496,773 acres are uncultivable waste. The spring harvest forms the main crop of the District. Wheat, the spring staple, covers nearly half the cultivated area; while spiked millet and cotton make up the chief items of the autumn harvest. Among the more valuable commercial crops, sugar-cane is grown only in the valley of the Chen\u00e1b, and poppy in the Jehlam lowlands between Sh\u00e1hpur and Bhera. Wheat thrives best in the alluvial soils that fringe the two rivers, where it is the only crop grown, as after it is cut floods inundate the whole valley, and only subside in time for the next sowing. It also grows luxuriantly in the rich hollows and basins among the Salt Range, where the cool climate admirably suits it.\n\nThe area under the principal crops in 1883-84 is returned as follows:\u2014Wheat, 214,314 acres; b\u00e1jra, 80,860 acres; jo\u00e1r, 17,865 acres; gram, 13,100 acres; oil-seeds, 23,468 acres; and cotton, 22,901 acres. Rice was grown on only 383 acres. The use of manure and the rotation of crops are little understood. Land from which a spring crop has been taken is occasionally sown afresh for the autumn harvest. In the Salt Range, the richness of the soil admits of successive sowings without any repose; in the tract below the hills, the torrents bring down perpetual supplies of fresh detritus; in the alluvial fringe of the rivers, the floods fertilize the soil by their annual deposit of silt, and so render possible a constant succession of double crops; but elsewhere the land lies fallow every second year. The average out-turn per acre of the principal products was returned as follows in 1883-84:\u2014Wheat, 780 lbs.; inferior grains, 430 lbs.; oil-seeds, 350 lbs.; cotton, 140 lbs. The agricultural stock in the same year consisted of\u2014cows and bullocks, 199,740; horses, 2826; ponies, 1527; donkeys, 10,860; sheep and goats, 202,293; camels, 18,174; carts, 482; and ploughs, 51,015. An annual horse show is held every spring, at which prizes are given for the encouragement of horse-breeding. A cattle fair was held in connection with the horse show in 1882-83. The anarchy which followed the break-up of the Delhi Empire, and the grinding nature of the Sikh rule, have resulted in the disintegration of the village communities. Most of the tenures at present in existence belong to the type known as bh\u00e1y\u00e1ch\u00e1ra. Only 66 villages retain the ancient communal type. Agricultural labourers receive their wages entirely in kind, usually in the form of a\nproportion of the crops grown by their labour. Day-labourers receive from 3d. to 6d. per diem; skilled labourers, from 6d. to 1s. Prices of food-grains ruled as follows in 1883:\u2014Wheat, $29\\frac{1}{2}$ sers per rupee, or 3s. 9\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)d. per cwt.; barley, 42 sers per rupee, or 2s. 8d. per cwt.; jo\u00e1r, 42 sers per rupee, or 2s. 8d. per cwt.; bajra, 46 sers per rupee, or 2s. 5d. per cwt.; and best rice, 6 sers per rupee, or 18s. 8d. per cwt.\n\nCommerce and Trade, etc.\u2014The commercial importance of the District depends almost entirely upon its connection with the Salt Range, Mi\u00e1ni having been from time immemorial the centre for the salt of the Mayo Mines in Jehlam District. Opium and saji (carbonate of soda) are bought up by traders from R\u00e1wal Pindi, Si\u00e1lkot, and Kashm\u00edr (Cashmere); but most of the surplus produce of Sh\u00e1hpur finds its way down the river in country boats to M\u00falt\u00e1n and Sukkur (Sakhar). The chief exports are wheat, cotton, wool, gh\u00ed, and saltpetre; the principal imports \u2014 sugar, English piece-goods, and metals. The Povindah merchants from Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n bring down madder, dried fruits, gold coins, and spices in the winter, which they exchange for country cloth. Scarves of silk and cotton are manufactured at Khush\u00e1b; turned and lacquered toys at Sahiw\u00e1l; felt at Bhera; and blankets throughout the District. The Salt branch of the Punjab Northern State Railway from L\u00e1la M\u00fasa to Bhera runs through Sh\u00e1hpur District for a distance of 26 miles, with stations at Har\u00eda M\u00e1likw\u00e1l, Mi\u00e1ni, and Bhera. Good fair-weather roads intersect the District in several directions, the chief being that from Lahore to Bannu and Dera Ism\u00e1il Kh\u00e1n, which passes Sh\u00e1hpur and Khush\u00e1b, and that which runs along the left bank of the Jehlam from Pind D\u00e1dan Kh\u00e1n to M\u00falt\u00e1n. Tolerable roads also open up the Salt Range; and the two main rivers are navigable throughout their whole course within this District, affording water communication for 112 miles. Total length of roads, 1077 miles.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The District staff comprises a Deputy Commissioner, Assistant and extra-Assistant Commissioner, and the usual fiscal, medical, and constabulary officials. The total amount of revenue raised in the District in 1872\u201373 amounted to \u00a3469,955, of which sum the land-tax contributed only \u00a343,514. The largest item is that of salt and customs, amounting to as much as \u00a3418,579. The collection of the salt-tax makes Sh\u00e1hpur the most valuable District in point of revenue in the Punjab; but the mines from which the revenue is derived mostly lie within the neighbouring District of Jehlam. Excluding salt, which is merely a matter of account, the revenue of Sh\u00e1hpur District in 1883\u201384 amounted to \u00a355,290, of which \u00a339,019 was derived from the land-tax. Number of civil judges, 10; magistrates, 6. The total regular and town police force in 1883 amounted to 463 officers and men, being at the rate of 1 policeman to every 10\u00b71 square miles of area and every 908 of the population. The District jail, near\nthe civil station of Sh\u00e1hpur, contained in 1883 a daily average of 244 prisoners.\n\nEducation still remains at a very low ebb, except in the four larger towns, while the nomad peasantry of the b\u00e1r regard it with positive aversion. The District contained in 1883-84, 44 Government schools, with a total of 2778 pupils. The Census Report of 1881 returned 3562 boys and 97 girls as under instruction in 1881, besides 10,588 males and 130 females able to read and write but not under instruction. There is one printing press at Sh\u00e1hpur jail.\n\nFor administrative purposes, the District is sub-divided into 3 tahsils.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate of the plains is hot and dry, but in the Salt Range the temperature is cool and the rainfall more abundant. The annual rainfall at Sh\u00e1hpur civil station for 28 years ending 1881 averaged 14\u00b764 inches, the maximum during that period being 36 inches in 1868-69, and the minimum 11\u00b72 inches in 1866-67. No record of temperature is now kept, but the registers of 1868-70 give a mean temperature in the shade of 80\u00b765\u00b0 F. The principal endemic diseases are intermittent and remittent fevers, dysentery and diarrhoea. Goitre prevails on the right bank of the Chen\u00e1b, and guineaworm at the foot of the Salt Range. The total number of deaths reported in 1883 was 11,424, showing a death-rate of 27 per thousand; of these, 7549, or 17\u00b791 per thousand, were assigned to fevers. The District contains 11 charitable dispensaries, which afforded relief in 1883 to 82,226 persons, of whom 820 were in-patients.

Forms part of the watershed between Eastern and Western India. The scenery is wild and desolate, the only inhabitants being a few small colonies of Gonds and Baig\u00e1s. The Gejar and Garj\u00e1i stream down from the highlands in a series of waterfalls, the finest of which is 60 feet high; behind the falls yawn dark caverns, tenanted by wild beasts and by reputed evil spirits. Most of the range, however, is under the immediate protection of Mah\u00e1deva.\n\n**Sh\u00e1hpur.**\u2014Petty State of the Hall\u00e1r prant or division of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay Presidency; consisting of 4 villages, with 1 proprietor or tribute-payer.

Estimated area, 400 square miles. Population (1881) 51,750, namely, males 27,217, and females 24,533; dwelling in 1 town and 117 villages, and in 10,849 houses. Density of population, 129\u00b737 persons per square mile; villages per square mile, '29; houses per square mile, 27\u00b719; persons per house, 4\u00b777.

The country is flat and treeless, but fertile; much of it is pasture land.\n\nThe R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Sh\u00e1hpura also holds a fief under the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1n\u00e1 of Udaipur or Mew\u00e1r, consisting of 80 villages, with an estimated population of about 16,000 persons, and a revenue of \u00a33,500. Tribute of \u00a3300 is paid to the State of Udaipur. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 is thus a feudatory both of the British Government and of Udaipur. The ruling family is of the Sesodia R\u00e1jput clan, being descended from a former R\u00e1n\u00e1 of Udaipur. The founder of the house was Sur\u00e1j Mall, a younger son of the R\u00e1n\u00e1, from whom the late chief was tenth in lineal descent. Sur\u00e1j Mall received as his portion the pargan\u00e1 of Kherar in Udaipur; and his son also acquired from the Emperor Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n, in reward for his gallant services, a grant of the pargan\u00e1 of Phulia out of the crown lands of Ajmere, upon condition of furnishing certain horse and footmen for service. He abandoned the town of Phulia and founded the present town of SH\u00c1HPURA. In 1848, the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Sh\u00e1hpura received a sanad from the British Government fixing the amount of his tribute at \u00a31000 per annum, with the proviso that if the customs duties levied in Ajmere were abolished he should also cease\nto collect such duties, and in consideration of the loss of revenue his tribute should be reduced to \u00a3200. The chief also holds a sanad guaranteeing to him the right of adoption. The present R\u00e1j\u00e1, Dhir\u00e1j Nahar Singh, was born in 1855. A dispensary; vaccination is encouraged. Two schools. The military force of the State consists of 12 guns, 20 artillerymen, 160 cavalry, and 335 infantry.\n\n**Sh\u00e1hpura.**\u2014Capital of Sh\u00e1hpura State, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. Lat. 27\u00b0 23' 45\" N., long. 76\u00b0 1' E. School, in which Hindi and arithmetic are the chief subjects taught, attended in 1881 by 130 pupils. In 1875, a girls' school was established; but it was closed soon afterwards, though endeavours were being made in 1884 to resuscitate it. Population (1881) 10,652, namely, males 5453, and females 5199. Hindus number 8729; Muhammadans, 1920; and Christians, 3.\n\n**Sh\u00e1hpur\u00e1.**\u2014Town in R\u00e1mgarh tahsil, M\u00e1ndl\u00e1 District, Central Provinces. Population (1881) 2588, namely, Hindus, 2023; Muhammadans, 151; Jains, 5; Christians, 2; and non-Hindu aborigines, 407.\n\n**Sh\u00e1hpuri.**\u2014Small island, situated at the mouth of the N\u00e1af river in Chittagong District, Bengal; famous as having afforded the *casus belli* of the first Anglo-Burmese war. The Burmese claimed possession of the island, although it had for many years been in the undisputed occupation of the British. Tolls were levied upon boats belonging to Chittagong; and on one occasion, the demand being resisted, the Burmese fired upon the party and killed the steersman. This act of violence was followed by the assemblage of armed men on the eastern side of the N\u00e1af, and universal consternation pervaded the villages in this the most remote and unprotected portion of Chittagong District. On the night of the 24th September 1823, the Burmese proceeded to enforce their claim to the island of Sh\u00e1hpuri; a thousand men landed on the island, overpowered the guard, killed and wounded several of the party, and drove the rest off the island. As soon as this was known at Calcutta, a detachment of troops was sent to dislodge the Burmese, who, however, had previously retired. The occupation of Sh\u00e1hpuri by a military force had the effect of arresting for a time the hostile demonstrations of the Burmese on the Chittagong frontier. But not long afterwards the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Arakan was ordered to expel the English from Sh\u00e1hpuri, and officials from Ava proceeded to take possession of the island, which had been temporarily abandoned on account of its unhealthiness. This and other acts of hostility rendered war inevitable; and in a proclamation dated the 24th February 1824, the grounds on which the first Burmese war was declared were made known.\n\n**Shahr Sult\u00e1n.**\u2014Town and municipality in Al\u00edpur tahsil, Muzaffargarh District, Punjab; situated in lat. 29\u00b0 35' N., and long. 71\u00b0 2' E., 1\u00bd mile south of the Chen\u00e1b, on the road leading south from Muzaffargarh town. Population (1881) 2132, namely, Hindus, 1213; Muhammadans,\n913; and Sikhs, 6. Number of houses, 275. Municipal income (1883-84), \u00a3155, or an average of 1s. 5\u00bdd. per head. The town is favourably situated for trade; and as in all towns in this part of the country, beams are placed over the streets and covered with matting, so as to form a shady arcade. Police station, and primary school.\n\n**Sh\u00e1hz\u00e1dpur.**\u2014Town in Sir\u00e1thu tahsil, Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d District, North-Western Provinces; situated on the banks of the Ganges about a mile north of the Grand Trunk Road, and 6 miles east of Sir\u00e1thu town; lat. 25\u00b0 39' 55\" N., long. 81\u00b0 27' E. Population (1881) 3496. Formerly a flourishing town, and famous for its stamped cloth, and large trade in saltpetre; but now decayed and declining in population. Station of the Grand Trigonometrical Survey; post-office; ferry across the Ganges. A small house-tax is raised for police and conservancy purposes.\n\n**Shaikh\u00e1wati (Shekh\u00e1wati).**\u2014A Province of Jaipur State in R\u00e1jput\u00e1na; situated between lat. 27\u00b0 20' and 28\u00b0 33' N., and long. 74\u00b0 40' and 76\u00b0 5' E. It is bounded on the north-east by the Punjab States of Loh\u00e1ru and Pati\u00e1la, on the south-east by Jaipur proper, on the south by Jodhpur or M\u00e1rw\u00e1r, and on the west and north-west by Bikaner. The area is estimated at 5400 square miles; and the population, according to the Census of 1881, is 418,686 souls. In its physical aspects, the more fertile part of Shaikh\u00e1wati resembles Jaipur; but a large portion of the soil is sandy desert, like that of Bikaner. There are no perennial rivers; but a small stream, which rises in the northern part of Jaipur, flows northward for some distance through Shaikh\u00e1wati, ultimately losing itself in the sand. There is an important salt lake in the Province, called Kachor-Rewas; it is not worked by any means to its full capacity, but the yearly turn-out of salt is about 6000 tons. The minerals of Shaikh\u00e1wati are important; the copper-mines near Khetri being perhaps the most valuable in India. The ores are copper pyrites, mixed, it is said, with grey copper-ore (fahlerz or tetrahedrite); some carbonates also occur, and native copper has been found. Near the surface, also, in the shales, blue vitriol is produced by the decomposition of the pyrites. In the same mines cobalt is also obtained, the ore occurring in small veins. These mines have evidently been worked for a very long period. Some of the hills in the neighbourhood are honeycombed with old excavations; and the heaps of slag from the furnaces have accumulated in the course of time, until they now form a range of hillocks several hundred feet in length and from 30 to 40 feet high.\n\n**History, etc.**\u2014Shaikh\u00e1wati is politically a confederacy of petty R\u00e1jput chieftains, bound to each other and to their common overlord at Jaipur by the ties of clanship. The Shaikh\u00e1wats are a sept of that Kachw\u00e1ha clan whose head is the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 of Jaipur or Amber. They derive their name from Shaikhj\u00ed, the grandson of B\u00e1la\u00edj\u00ed, who was a\nyounger son of the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 of Jaipur in 1389 A.D., and received a portion of this territory in appanage. Shaikhj\u00ed was so called from a famous Musalm\u00e1n saint named Shaikh Burh\u00e1n, whose shrine near Achrol is still regarded with veneration, and whose prayers had been successfully invoked by Shaikhj\u00ed\u2019s father for the birth of a son and heir. In commemoration of this incident, every Shaikh\u00e1wat boy wears for two years from his birth the Musalm\u00e1n badi\u00e1 or threads, as well as the blue tunic and cap; and the Shaikh\u00e1wat sportsmen never hunt the wild hog or touch its flesh, although by other R\u00e1jputs it is commonly eaten once a year. Moreover, although the lands surrounding the saint\u2019s dargah belong now to the demesne of the Jaipur Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1, the dargah itself is a sanctuary, and rent-free lands are held by about a hundred families descended from Shaikh Burh\u00e1n. Shaikhj\u00ed\u2019s father and grandfather had paid as tribute to the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 all the colts reared on their land; but Shaikhj\u00ed so enlarged his power that for some generations the lords of Shaikh\u00e1wati became independent of the parent State.\n\nFrom Shaikhj\u00ed\u2019s great-grandson, R\u00e1\u00ed S\u00edl, are descended the chieftains of Southern Shaikh\u00e1wati, who hence have always been known as R\u00e1isilots; and from a younger son of R\u00e1\u00ed S\u00edl are descended the principal chieftains of Northern Shaikh\u00e1wati, called the S\u00e1dh\u00e1n\u00ed. The chief settlement of the R\u00e1isilots, and the most important principality of Shaikh\u00e1wati, was at Khandela; whilst the early seat of the S\u00e1dh\u00e1n\u00ed was at Udaipur, another town of this territory, not to be confounded with the capital of Mew\u00e1r. There have been, and still are, many other branches of the family, between whom feuds, conquests, and reconquests have been interminable. R\u00e1\u00ed S\u00edl himself became chief both of Khandela and of Udaipur by the help of the Delhi Emperor; and he is mentioned in the Ain-i-Akbar\u00ed as a mansabd\u00e1r of 1250 horse under Akbar. After the fatal battle of Merta, in 1754, had laid R\u00e1jput\u00e1na prostrate at the feet of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s under De Boigne, Shaikh\u00e1wati suffered severely from their ravages; most of the towns were sacked, the capital, Khandela, being saved from that fate only by heavy payment. Later on, it was the scene of some of the exploits of the famous adventurer George Thomas, who was called in by a chief of Khandela to aid him against Jaipur. Finally, however, the Shaikh\u00e1wat chieftains acknowledged the suzerainty of Jaipur, though the bond seems never to have been very close. The leading chiefships are those of Sikar and Khandela, Khetri, and Kotputli.\n\nThe custom of equal division on succession to land in Shaikh\u00e1wati is similar to that which prevails in Mal\u00e1ni, a dependency of Jodhpur that holds much the same kind of relation to its parent State that Shaikh\u00e1wati does to Jaipur; and therein the custom differs from that prevalent elsewhere throughout R\u00e1jput\u00e1na, where the eldest son suc-\nceeds. The custom, however, does not appear to extend to the larger estates and chiefships in Shaikhawati.\n\nShaikh Bud\u00edn (Shekh Bud\u00edn).\u2014Hill sanatorium (so called from the shrine of a famous Muhammadan saint, Shaikh Bah\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn, which crowns its summit) in Bannu (Bunnoo) and Dera Ism\u00e1il Kh\u00e1n Districts, Punjab, lying in lat. $32\u00b0\\ 17'\\ 48''\\ N.$, and long. $70\u00b0\\ 50'\\ 48''\\ E.$, on the border of the two Districts, and jointly administered by the Deputy Commissioners of both Districts. Elevation above sea-level, 4516 feet. Distant from Dera Ism\u00e1il Kh\u00e1n town 40 miles north, from Bannu town 64 miles south. The sanatorium crowns a bare limestone rock, which rises abruptly from the low range of Mohar, whose highest point it forms. A few stunted wild olives and acacias compose the only vegetation on the shadeless slope. The heat is frequently excessive, the thermometer ranging inside a bungalow from $88\u00b0$ to $94\u00b0\\ F.$, though mitigated from June to October by a cool south-western breeze. This drawback, combined with the want of sufficient water-supply and the paucity of building sites, renders Shaikh Bud\u00edn a very inadequate sanatorium. Persons who go up in good health are seldom attacked by illness; but the climate is not bracing enough for constitutions which require a radical change.\n\nShaikhpur\u00e1.\u2014Town in Monghyr District, Bengal. Lat. $25\u00b0\\ 8'\\ 30''\\ N.$, long. $85\u00b0\\ 53'\\ 11''\\ E.$ Population (1881) 12,517, namely, males 5945, and females 6572. Hindus number 8411, and Muhammadans 4106.\n\nShakargarh.\u2014Tahsil of Gurd\u00e1spur District, Punjab; comprising the whole trans-R\u00e1vi portion of the District, except Narot pargan\u00e1. Area, 501 square miles; towns and villages, 709; houses, 29,592; resident families, 47,508. Total population, 219,511, namely, males 114,617, and females 104,894. Classified according to religion, Hindus number 109,241; Muhammadans, 105,176; Sikhs, 5090; and Christians, 4. Average density of population, 438 persons per square mile. Of the 709 villages and towns, 594 contain less than five hundred inhabitants; 83 between five hundred and a thousand; and 32 between one thousand and five thousand. The average annual area under cultivation for the five years ending 1881\u201382 is returned at $32\\frac{1}{2}$ square miles, or 207,079 acres; the principal crops being\u2014wheat, 76,457 acres; barley, 48,198 acres; rice, 11,623 acres; Indian corn, 8523 acres; moth, 7009 acres; jo\u00e1r, 6899 acres; bajra, 2848 acres; gram, 2687 acres; sugar-cane, 9519 acres; cotton, 5783 acres; tobacco, 1151 acres; and vegetables, 1723 acres. Revenue of the tahsil, \u00a327,783. The administrative staff consists of a tahsild\u00e1r and a munsif, who preside over 1 criminal and 2 civil courts; number of police circles (th\u00e1n\u00eds), 3; regular police, 48 men; village watch or rural police (chauk\u00edd\u00e1rs), 673.\nShakargarh.\u2014Town and fort in Peshawar District, Punjab.\u2014See Shabkadar.\n\nShalamar (Sh\u00e1hlim\u00e1r).\u2014Gardens and pleasure-ground in Lahore District, situated 4 miles east of Lahore city. These gardens were laid out in 1667 by Al\u00ed Mard\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n, the celebrated engineer of Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n, in imitation of the garden planned by the Emperor Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr at the sources of the Jehlam (Jhelum) river in Kashmir (Cashmere). The garden consisted of seven divisions representing the seven degrees of the Paradise of Isl\u00e1m, of which only three are included in the present area of about 80 acres, the remainder having fallen into decay. In the centre is a reservoir bordered by an elaborately indented coping and studded with pipes for fountains. A cascade falls into it over a slope of marble corrugated in an ornamental carved diaper. During the troublous times of Ahmad Sh\u00e1h the gardens were neglected, and some of the decorative works were defaced and removed. Ranj\u00edt Singh restored them; but at the same time he laid ruthless hands upon the marble pavilions of the central reservoir, using them to adorn the R\u00e1mb\u00e1gh at Amritsar, and substituting structures of brick and whitewash in their stead. The Shal\u00e1m\u00e1r Gardens are a favourite resort for f\u00eates and picnics, and the luxuriant foliage of the mango and orange trees lends itself with admirable effect to illuminations.\n\nSh\u00e1l\u00ed.\u2014Hill in Bhajji State, Simla District, Punjab.

But it is as a place of historical interest that Sherpur is most deserving of notice. It is mentioned in the Ain-i-Akbari, 1595 A.D., as the site of a fort called Sal\u00edmnagar, in honour of Salim, the son of Akbar, afterwards famous as the Emperor Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr. It also figures in the writings of other Muhammadan historians as an important frontier post, previous to the conquest of South-Eastern Bengal, and the establishment of the Government at Dacca. These writers always refer to the place as Sherpur Murch\u00e1, to distinguish it from another Sherpur in Maimansingh; and it is marked on Van den Broucke's Map (1660) as 'Ceerpoor Mirts.' R\u00e1j\u00e1 M\u00e1n Singh, Akbar's Hindu general, is said to have built a palace at Sherpur; and it is very probable that he would make use of so convenient a centre, from which to dominate Southern Bengal, and particularly Jessor, which then included a large part of the present District of Pabn\u00e1, and was held by the rebel zam\u00edn\u00edd\u00e1r, R\u00e1j\u00e1 Prat\u00e1p\u00e1ditya, against whom M\u00e1n Singh specially directed his arms.\n\nSherpur.\u2014Town and municipality in Maimansingh District, Bengal. Lat. $25^\\circ 0' 58''$ N., long. $90^\\circ 3' 6''$ E.; lies between the rivers Shir\u00ed and Mirghi, about half a mile from the former and 1 mile from the latter, 9 miles north of Jamalpur. Population (1881) 8710, including the\nsuburbs of N\u00e1r\u00e1yanpur and Barukp\u00e1r\u00e1. Muhammadans number 4467; Hindus, 4161; and 'others,' 82. Municipal income (1883\u201384), \u00a3456, of which \u00a3383 was derived from taxation; average incidence of taxation, 10\u00bdd. per head. There is no water carriage to the town, and even water for drinking and household purposes is obtained solely from tanks. Sherpur contains a fine Hindu temple; its buildings in general are in bad repair, and the place has a decayed and neglected appearance. Police station, post-office, munsif's court, and a good school. Considerable river trade. In 1876\u201377, the registered exports comprised 27,100 maunds of jute (mostly sent to N\u00e1r\u00e1yanganj), 35,100 maunds of rice and paddy, and 30,600 maunds of mustard seed; the imports included European piece-goods, valued at \u00a35770, and 1200 maunds of betel-nuts. Owing to an alteration in the system of trade registration, no later statistics are available. A weekly newspaper, the Charu Bartta, is published at Sherpur, the proprietor being one of the leading Hindu zam\u00ednd\u00e1rs.\n\nSherpur.\u2014Sub-division and town of Kh\u00e1ndesh District, Bombay Presidency.\u2014See SHIRPUR.\n\nSher Sh\u00e1h.\u2014Large village in M\u00falt\u00e1n District, Punjab; situated in lat. 30\u00b0 6' 45\" N., and long. 71\u00b0 20' E., upon the Chen\u00e1b river. Until the opening of the Indus Valley State Railway in 1879, Sher Sh\u00e1h was the terminus of the line from M\u00falt\u00e1n, and the port of the steam flotilla that plied to Kar\u00e1chi (Kurrachee).\n\nShevar\u00e1yar Malai.\u2014Hills in Salem District, Madras Presidency.\u2014See SHEVAROY.\n\nShetrunja (Satrunjaya).\u2014Place of Jain pilgrimage in P\u00e1lit\u00e1na, Gujar\u00e1t, Bombay Presidency.\u2014See PALITANA TOWN.\n\nShevaroy.\u2014Hill range in Salem District, Madras; situated between 11\u00b0 43' and 11\u00b0 55' N. lat., and between 78\u00b0 13' and 78\u00b0 24' 30\" E. long. The hills occupy a total area of 151\u00b767 square miles, with a plateau of about 20 square miles; a high plateau (Yercaud) on the southern portion of the eastern block of about 10 square miles; and plateaux (P\u00faliy\u00far and Nagal\u00far) on the east and west sides of the Green Hills. The last-named form the western portion of the Shevaroys, and are separated from the eastern portion by the valley of the Vanniar. Average elevation, 4500 feet; highest point in the Green Hills, 5410 feet above the sea. The total population of the hills was returned in 1881 at 10,513.\n\nThree regular gh\u00e1ts or passes lead to the table-lands\u2014(1) the Salem gh\u00e1t, on the south, which commences at the fifth milestone from Salem, about 5\u00bd miles long, is the favourite gh\u00e1t pass, as coolies are more easily obtained; it is in some parts very steep: (2) the Aht\u00far gh\u00e1t commences at the Shevaroy Hills station on the Madras Railway southwest line; the distance by it to Yercaud is about 11 miles: (3) the\nMallapuram gh\u00e1t on the north; distance from Mallapuram station on the Madras Railway south-west line to Yercaud, about 19 miles. This gh\u00e1t is of easy gradient for the first 9 miles, but very steep in its ascent to the Nagalur plateau. Besides these well-known gh\u00e1ts, the hills are accessible by footpaths from many other points.\n\nThe native inhabitants of the plateau and slopes consist of Vell\u00e1lars or Malay\u00e1lis. (See Salem District.) Their former mode of cultivation was kum\u00e1ri or nomadic tillage, which consists in clearing and burning a piece of forest or jungle, after which the soil is turned up with a hoe and sown; the next year this land is abandoned for a fresh spot. This system, however, has been put a stop to by the Forest Department, as it was extremely destructive. The number of Malay\u00e1lis inhabiting the hills is not known, but they are supposed to be increasing, looking to the amount of revenue received from them.\n\nMonumental remains are common, and consist of cairns or cromlechs, much resembling those found on the Nilgiris. The present inhabitants have no traditions relating to them.\n\nThe vegetation does not differ materially from that of other hill ranges of Southern India. The base of the Shevaroy mountains is covered with the common forms of vegetation found in the adjoining low country. The middle region is clothed with a zone of bamboo jungle, which ascends to a height of about 3000 feet, where it abruptly terminates. Teak, blackwood, and sandal-wood are also found, in favourable situations, up to this elevation. The teak, in a stunted form, is met with on the mountain plateau at an elevation of 4500 feet. The soil and climate seem to be peculiarly adapted for gardening operations. Among imported plants which thrive readily may be mentioned the pear, loquat, peach, apple, guava, strawberry, plantain, citron, orange, lime, lemon, and Brazil cherry. The Australian acacias, eucalyptus, and the casuarina grow; the silk oak (Grevillea robusta) flourishes. Cinchona has been introduced, and is thriving. The coffee-plant was naturalized in these hills about forty years ago by Mr. Cockburn, late of the Madras Civil Service; and in 1883 the total area taken up by planters was about 10,000 acres, of which, however, only about one-half was cultivated. The number of coffee plantations is nearly 300. The tea-plant grows luxuriantly, though it has not yet (1883) been cultivated with a view to the manufacture of tea. Oranges are common, especially the Seville and sweet varieties. The lemon, lime, and shaddock succeed equally well.\n\nThe most common animals are the leopard, bear, wild hog, jungle-sheep, mouse-deer, hy\u00e6na, jackal, jungle-cat, hare, etc. Tigers are sometimes met with. A few bison exist on the neighbouring hills, but of late years have not been seen on the Shevaroys. Among birds may be mentioned the jungle and spur fowl, partridge, quail, wild pigeon,\nwoodcock, and snipe. Cobras, vipers, scorpions, and centipedes are seldom found.\n\nWhen the Shevaroys first began to attract notice forty years ago, the Government revenue derived from the whole of the hill villages was \u00a335 yearly, which by 1883 had increased to upwards of \u00a3800. The great present want is a cart road from Salem, and the improvement of the interior roads. The revenue from coffee land is about \u00a3500, and from land under native cultivation, \u00a3300. A small detachment of police from Salem District is stationed on the hills. A Deputy tahsildar resides at Yercaud, and the Salem munisif visits the place once every three months to decide suits. There are European residents at Yercaud, and visitors resort to the station for the hot weather and holidays; accommodation is scarce. Church, post-office, dispensary, reading-room, club, and hotel.\n\nThe principal localities on the Shevaroys are Yercaud, the Green Hills, Nagalur, Puliyur, Puttipadi, Maramangalam, and the Talasholay spur.\n\nYERCAUD (Verk\u00e1du) is the oldest and largest European settlement in the hills. It is situated on that portion of the plateau nearest to the town of Salem. The land in the valleys is undulating, and a great portion of it is already under coffee cultivation. The hill peaks are for the most part bare of soil, and the steep slopes are covered with low jungle.\n\nThe Green Hills are higher than any other portion of the range, and vary from 4500 to 5400 feet above sea-level. They differ much in appearance from any other portion of the Shevaroys. The tops of the hills are rounded, and covered only with grass and low stunted shrubs; the ravines are wooded, as on the Nilgiris (Neilgherries). The rounded and undulating appearance of this portion of the Shevaroys contrasts markedly with the rugged peaks and wooded slopes about Yercaud. This difference is due chiefly to the Green Hills being capped with laterite, in some places of considerable thickness. Several coffee plantations have been opened by Europeans and Eurasians upon the Green Hills; and there is a fine expanse of table-land, partly under cultivation by the hill tribes, which has been pointed out as a site well adapted for a sanitarium for European troops. This site occupies about 250 acres of land, and appears to be eminently suited for building.\n\nThe Shevaroy range possesses a very equable climate. Partaking as it does of both monsoons, the rainfall is considerable, being an annual average of from 65 to 70 inches, or double that of the rainfall on the surrounding plains. The moisture of the air is tolerably constant during the year. In a room without fire, and with open windows, the thermometer seldom stands below 65\u00b0 F., and rarely\nrises above 75\u00b0 F. in the hottest months. A malarious type of fever occasionally prevails, but it is chiefly confined to the planters and others who live in, or visit, the jungles at the lower elevations. It is not improbable that some forms of disease, which are aggravated by the climate of the Nilgiris, may be treated with benefit on the Shevaroys, such as rheumatism, affections of the liver, bowel complaints, etc.\n\n**Shi\u00e1r.**\u2014Mountain pass in Bashahr (Bussahir) State, Punjab, over a southward spur of the Himalayas, which bound Kunaw\u00e1r to the south.

Elevation above sea-level, 13,720 feet.\n\n**Shibi (Sibi).**\u2014Village in T\u00famk\u00far District, Mysore State; 15 miles north of T\u00famk\u00far town. Population (1881) 177. Celebrated for a temple of Vishnu, after his name of Nara-sinha, erected by three brothers in the beginning of this century. It is a plain structure, surrounded by a high stone wall. The annual festival, held for 15 days from the full moon in the month of M\u00e2gh, is attended by 10,000 people, and supplies the occasion for a great deal of trade.\n\n**Shidhpur.**\u2014Town in Baroda State.\u2014See SIDHPUR.\n\n**Shi-gun.**\u2014Village in the Ta-pun township of Henzada District, Pegu Division, Lower Burma.

Population (1878) 1789; not returned separately in the Census Report of 1881.\n\n**Shik\u00e1rpur.**\u2014British District in Sind, Bombay, lying between 27 and 29\u00b0 N. lat., and between 67\u00b0 and 70\u00b0 E. long. Bounded on the north by Bal\u00fachist\u00e1n, the Upper Sind Frontier District, and the river Indus; on the east by the Native States of Bah\u00e1walpur and Jaisalm\u00edr (Jeysulmere); on the south by Khairpur State and the Schw\u00e1n Sub-division of Kar\u00e1chi (Kurrachee) District; and on the west by the Khirthar Mountains. Area, 10,001 square miles. Population (1881) 852,986. The District comprises the 4 Sub-divisions of Rohri, Sukkur, Larkhana, and Mehar. The administrative head-quarters are at Shik\u00e1rpur Town, which is also the most populous place in the District; but their transfer to Sukkur has been approved by Government, and will shortly take place.\n\n**Physical Aspects.**\u2014The general aspect of Shik\u00e1rpur District is that of a vast alluvial plain, broken only at Sukkur (Sakkar) and Rohri by low limestone hills, which tend to preserve a permanent bank for the Indus at those places. Towards the west, in the Mehar and L\u00e1rkh\u00e1na Sub-divisions, rises the Khirthar range, with an extreme elevation of upwards of 7000 feet, forming a natural boundary between Shik\u00e1rpur and Bal\u00fachist\u00e1n. Large patches of salt land, known as kalar, occur frequently, especially in the upper part of the District; and towards the Jacob\u00e1b\u00e1d frontier, barren tracts of clay, and ridges of sandhills\ncovered with caper and thorn jungle, constitute a distinctive feature in the landscape. The desert portion of the Rohri Sub-division, known as the Registh\u00e1n, possesses extensive sandhills, bold in outline and often fairly wooded. The forests of Shik\u00e1rpur cover a total area of 207 square miles.\n\n**History.**\u2014The Districts of Upper Sind can hardly be said to have a history separate from that of the whole Province. Before the Muhammadan invasion, in 712 A.D., this portion of Sind was ruled by a Br\u00e1hman race, with their capital at Aror (or Alor), 5 miles distant from the modern town of Rohri. Shik\u00e1rpur continued for some time a dependency of the Ummayid dynasty, and subsequently of the Abassides. In conjunction with the rest of Sind, it was conquered by Mahm\u00fad of Ghazn\u00ed, about 1025 A.D.; but his rule was of short duration, being replaced, about 1032, by the S\u00famra dynasty. The latter was succeeded in its turn by the Samma family, and this again by the Argh\u00fans; for an account of all of which, see the article on Sind.\n\nUpper Sind does not come into any prominence till the accession to power of the Kalhora dynasty, in the early part of the 18th century. Previous to this, the country, which had been annexed in 1591\u201392 to the Delhi Empire by Akbar, was ruled by a succession of governors; and a powerful tribe, the D\u00e1\u00fadputras, had arisen and displaced the Mahars, an influential clan, whose chief town was then at Lakhi, 9 miles south-east of Shik\u00e1rpur town. These Mahars had themselves some time before driven out the Jatois, a race of Bal\u00fach\u00eds, in a manner thus described by Captain (now Major-General) Sir F. G. Goldsmid, in his historical memoir of Shik\u00e1rpur, written in 1854:\n\n\u2018There were seven brothers of the tribe (Mahars) in Ubauro, near the present Bah\u00e1walpur frontier, of whom one, by name Jaisar, not finding a residence with his near kindred to accord with his views of independence, turned his steps to Bukkur (Bakkar), then occupied by the noted Mahm\u00fad, governor, under Sh\u00e1h Beg Argh\u00fan, of the fort in 1541 A.D.\n\n\u2018The Jatois, a race of Bal\u00fach\u00eds, held the country on the west bank of the river between B\u00fardika and L\u00e1rkh\u00e1na. This included the town of Lakhi, then a flourishing place, so called from Lakhu, as Gosarji was from Gosar, and Adamji from Adam Jatoi. Jaisar crossed the river and took up his abode among the villages of this people. The Mahars and their new comrades disagreed; but the former had a friend at court, one M\u00fasa Kh\u00e1n Mehr, who was a man of influence with Mahm\u00fad, and obtained the assistance of some hundred men to quell the disturbance, by asserting the rights of his own side. The consequence was the subjection of the Jatois, and a partition of their country. Jaisar received the tract extending from Mehl\u00e1ni to L\u00e1rkh\u00e1na as a free gift (tindad and madad-mash), on the condition that, after the lapse of a generation, one-tenth of the produce would be claimed by the\nGovernment. The Jatois obtained the northern allotment, from Mehl\u00e1ni to B\u00fardika, on payment, however, of the customary land-tax. Jaisar Kh\u00e1n remained at Lakhi, which thus became, as it were, his property; and at his death, his son Akil, in conjunction with a brother, Bakkar, and a cousin, Wadera Sujan Kh\u00e1n, determined on building a new town to replace the old one. The fort which they erected may still be traced. Sujan also built a village called Mar\u00falo, after his son Mar\u00fa, now known as Wazir\u00e1b\u00e1d, from Sh\u00e1h Wali, the Waz\u00edr of Ahmad Sh\u00e1h Dur\u00e1ni, whose perquisite it in after years became.\n\nBut the Mahars had to contend with the D\u00e1\u00fadputras, who were by profession both warriors and weavers. The results of the contest, and consequent foundation of the city of Shik\u00e1rpur, are thus narrated by General Sir F. G. Goldsmid:\u2014\u2018The weavers (D\u00e1\u00fadputras) appealed to spiritual authority, as represented in the person of P\u00edr Sult\u00e1n Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Sh\u00e1h, whose tomb still bears testimony to the fact of his existence. He was a holy man of eminence, and numbered the Mahars, as well as their opponents, among his disciples, and he moreover himself resided at Lakhi. He took up the cause of the appellants, and eventually obtained permission for them to resume their hunting in the Shik\u00e1rgahs, from which they had been warned off by the Mahars. Again, however, they were stopped, and again did they seek the P\u00edr for redress. The Mahars were summoned a second time, and ordered to desist. They remonstrated, and finally informed their venerable mentor that they would never spare the intruders till they had exterminated the whole body, or at least driven them from the vicinity of the Shik\u00e1rgah, adding, \u201cIf you wish to be their comrade, good, be it so.\u201d\n\n\u2018Baffled and distressed, the P\u00edr bethought him of the final resource in such cases. He invoked curses on the rebelling Mahars, and blessings upon the oppressed D\u00e1\u00fadputras. He told his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s that they were as the iron sickle, and their enemies as grass or chaff, and promised them the victory in the event of an engagement. The plot prospered. The crisis drew on, and the battle became inevitable. According to the story of the sons of D\u00e1\u00fad, their ancestors on this occasion could only muster a force of 300 or 400 fighting men, while their opponents numbered 12,000. A sanguinary conflict ensued on the meeting of the hostile forces, which, after the most determined endeavours on either side, eventually terminated in favour of the D\u00e1\u00fadputras, who were left masters of the field. Strange to say, while some 3000 dead bodies of Mahars strewed the ground, but few were killed on the side of the victors. A vigorous pursuit succeeded this victory. It was known that the wealthy zamind\u00e1rs of Lakhi had l\u00e1khs of rupees concealed in that city. Thither went the D\u00e1\u00fadputras; and it is by no means unlikely that, on this particular occasion, they found\nmeans of improving the condition of their financial and commissariat departments.\n\n'The P\u00edr received his successful pupils with as much mundane satisfaction as could be expressed by so holy a man. He congratulated them, and, mounting his palfrey,' continues General Goldsmid, 'he led the weavers to the scene of their exploits. He halted at the ground on which now stands the commercial capital of Upper Sind. Muttering some mysterious words, which immediately instilled a dramatic awe into the hearts of the bystanders, he raised his hand high in the air, and gracefully dropped an iron nail, which had long been held there unnoticed. The nature of the movement brought the point well into the earth. It remained transfixed in an admirable position for the chief performer of the play. He pointed to the instrument upon which all eyes were drawn. \"Here,\" said the P\u00edr, \"let a city be built, and let it bear the distinguished name of Shik\u00e1rpur!\" The air rang with shouts, and the proceedings terminated in the usual manner on such occasions. The jungle was cut and cleared; neighbours were summoned, threatened, and cajoled; the work proceeded with vigour and rapidity, and by degrees a town appeared. The town in due course became a city, noted for the wealth and enterprise of its merchants, the size and business of its b\u00e1z\u00e1r, a hot-bed of intrigue, debauchery, bribery, oppression, evil-speaking, and many other kinds of corruption; and so passed away the years till the dawn of the 18th century.'\n\nThe Kalhoras had, during the 17th century, been gradually laying the foundation of their subsequent sovereignty in Sind, and the career of Y\u00e1r Muhammad, the first ruler of this line, is thus described by Goldsmid:\u2014'M\u00edrza Bakhtawar Kh\u00e1n, son of M\u00edrza Panni, was ruler of Siwi, and held a large tract on the west bank of the Indus, in the environs of Shik\u00e1rpur. Y\u00e1r Muhammad, associated with R\u00e1j\u00e1 Likki and Iltas Kh\u00e1n Brahui, recommenced aggressive measures by a movement in the country bordering on the Manchhar Lake. He possessed himself of Samt\u00e1ni, expelling the Panhwars and their head-man, Kaisar; and despatched his brother, M\u00edr Muhammad, to extend his acquisitions by a diversion in an opposite quarter. His objects were achieved with skill and rapidity. His career of conquest made Iltas leave him. \"You have no need of me; heaven is on your side; that suffices,\" said the rough Brahui. Kandi\u00e1ro and L\u00e1rkh\u00e1na were taken, among less important places. The latter had been held by M\u00e1lik Al\u00e1 Bakhsh, brother of Bakhtawar. The M\u00edrza, upon these reverses, appealed to the Sh\u00e1hz\u00e1da in M\u00falt\u00e1n, Moiz-ud-d\u00edn (afterwards Jah\u00e1ndar Sh\u00e1h), who no sooner heard the report than he turned to the scene of disturbance. Then Bakhtawar's heart misgave him, for he did not wish to see the country entrusted to his charge overrun by the troops of his master. He had probably private and particular reasons for the objection\nunknown to the historian. He prayed the prince to withhold his march, and on the refusal of his request, had actually the audacity to oppose the advancing hosts. He was slain, and Moiz-ud-d\u00edn repaired to Bukkur. Y\u00e1r Mu\u1e25ammad does not appear to have suffered severely for his offences; on the contrary, the Sh\u00e1hz\u00e1da came gradually round to favour his views of aggrandizement. One after another, new governors were appointed for Siwi, which Province in course of time was handed over to the Wakils of the Kalhoras. Y\u00e1r Mu\u1e25ammad received the imperial title of Kh\u00fada Y\u00e1r Kh\u00e1n.'\n\nThe reigns of the several Kalhora princes will be found described in some detail in the section treating of the history of the Province. During the Talpur rule, various parts of Upper Sind, such as B\u00fardika, R\u00fapar, the town of Sukkur, and other places, which were dependencies of the Dur\u00e1ni kingdom, had, between the years 1809 and 1824, been gradually annexed to the possessions of the Khairpur M\u00edrs, Sohr\u00e1b, R\u00fastam, and Mub\u00e1rak. Shik\u00e1rpur was the only spot that remained to Afgh\u00e1n\u00edst\u00e1n; and that town eventually came into the peaceable possession of the M\u00edrs in 1824, at a time when Abd\u00fal Mans\u00far Kh\u00e1n was governor of the place, and when the Sikhs were said to be contemplating an attack upon it. Goldsmid thus refers to this circumstance in his memoir:\u2014'Three or four months after the departure of Rah\u00edm Dil Kh\u00e1n, it began to be rumoured that the Sikhs were contemplating an attack upon Shik\u00e1rpur. At this time the Chevalier Ventura was with a force at Der\u00e1 Gh\u00e1z\u00ed Kh\u00e1n. The M\u00edrs of Sind\u2014Karam and Mur\u00e1d \u00c1li of Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d, and Sohr\u00e1b, R\u00fastam, and Mub\u00e1rak of Khairpur\u2014seeing that it would be of great advantage that they should at this juncture take the city into their own hands, deputed the Naw\u00e1b Wali Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u00e1n Lugh\u00e1ri to dispossess the Afgh\u00e1ns, and carry out the wishes of his masters. The Naw\u00e1b commenced by writing to Abd\u00fal Mans\u00far several letters to the following effect:\n\n\"'Undoubtedly the Sikhs did wish to take Shik\u00e1rpur, and were approaching for that particular purpose. Its proximity to the M\u00edrs' possessions in Sind made it very inconvenient for them that it should fall into the hands of this people; moreover, the capture of the place, under the circumstances, would be disgraceful, or at least discreditable, and it was the part of wise men to apply a remedy in time when available. The Afgh\u00e1ns were not in a position to oppose the coming enemy; their Sard\u00e1rs in Khor\u00e1s\u00e1n were in the habit of eating superior mutton, Pesh\u00e1war rice, luscious grapes, raisins, delicious cold melons, seedless pomegranates, and rich comfits, and of drinking iced water; it was on account of this application of cold to the body that a martial and lordly spirit possessed them, which it is not the property of heat to impart. It was, moreover, necessary to the well-\nbeing of their hardy constitution. While the army was coming from Khoras\u00e1n, the city would glide from their hands.\" A well-known Persian proverb was here judiciously interpolated, viz., On calling the closed fist to remembrance after the battle, it will be necessary to let the blow fall upon one's own head. \"In fine, taking all things into consideration, how much better would it be for the M\u00edrs to occupy Shik\u00e1rpur; they were Muhammadans as well as the Afgh\u00e1ns. Once having driven away the Sikhs, and deprived the infidels of their dominions, Shik\u00e1rpur was at no distance; let it then become the property of the Sard\u00e1rs. Now, in the way of kindness, let them (the Afgh\u00e1ns) return to Khoras\u00e1n, and join their comrades at table in discussing the pilaws and fruits, whereby cure is obtainable of this most destructive heat.\"\n\n'Abd\u00fal Mans\u00far Kh\u00e1n, upon receiving these communications, became greatly perplexed, and thought of returning to Khoras\u00e1n. The M\u00edrs, much as they desired to take possession of the town, were obliged to content themselves with assembling an army without its walls, on the plea of protection against a Sikh invasion. They encamped in the Sh\u00e1hi B\u00e1gh. The Naw\u00e1b sent for J\u00fama Kh\u00e1n Barakzai, and through him opened fresh communications with the governor, and tried every artifice to persuade the latter to quit his post. Finding a bold stroke of diplomacy necessary, he urged that he would hold him responsible for the town revenues accruing after the date of the original proposition for transfer to the M\u00edrs. This argument had the desired effect; Abd\u00fal Mans\u00far refused to refund, but agreed to abandon Shik\u00e1rpur. In this interval, Dil\u00e1war, Khitmatg\u00e1r to the Naw\u00e1b, entered the city, and coming to the house of Shauk\u00e1r Muya R\u00e1m, established his head-quarters there, and caused the change of Government to be notified throughout the b\u00e1z\u00e1r and streets. The M\u00edrs' followers came gradually in, and at length were regularly installed, and obtained the keys of the eight gates.\n\n'The next day, Abd\u00fal Mans\u00far Kh\u00e1n, at J\u00fama Kh\u00e1n's instigation, visited the Naw\u00e1b in the Sh\u00e1hi B\u00e1gh. The latter, after much flattery and compliment, gave him his dismissal. The ex-governor repaired with his effects to Garhi Y\u00e1sin, a town in the neighbourhood, and stayed there to execute some unfinished commissions. In a few days, the Naw\u00e1b ordered him to depart from thence, which he did, and was soon far on his way to Kandah\u00e1r. Wali Muhammad felt relieved, and applauded his own handiwork, in that he had won a bloodless victory. He had deprived the Afgh\u00e1ns of a much-loved settlement, and added it to the possessions of the M\u00edrs. The revenue was divided into seven shares; four became the property of the M\u00edrs of Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d, and three of their relatives of Khairpur. Kazim Sh\u00e1h was the new governor.'\nIn 1833, during the Talpur rule, Sh\u00e1h Sh\u00faja, the dethroned Afghan monarch, made an expedition into Upper Sind to recover his lost territory. He marched with a force via Bah\u00e1walpur towards Shik\u00e1rpur. He was met near Khairpur by Kazim Sh\u00e1h, the former governor of Shik\u00e1rpur, and escorted to the city with all honour, where he was to stay forty days and receive 40,000 rupees (\u00a34000). But though he took the money, he did not leave at the appointed time. Public feeling in Sind ran high. Those who declared for the Sh\u00e1h on the west bank were taken under his especial protection. He appointed local officials, and commenced legislating for his Sindian prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, treating them in the light of subjects. The climax was a burst of indignation from the offended M\u00edrs, and a rising of their Bal\u00fach retainers. A Bal\u00fach army, under M\u00edr Mub\u00e1rak and Zang\u00ed Kh\u00e1n, crossed the river at Rohri, and took up a position at Sukkur, while Sh\u00e1h Sh\u00faja despatched a force of 2000 men under his lieutenant, Samandhar Kh\u00e1n, to meet it. The M\u00edrs had been drawn up near the L\u00e1l\u00e1w\u00e1h Canal, which the Sh\u00e1h\u2019s general attacked, throwing the Bal\u00fach\u00eds into instant confusion, and ultimately defeating them. This victory resulted in the payment to the Sh\u00e1h by the M\u00edrs of 4 l\u00e1khs of rupees (say \u00a340,000), and 50,000 rupees (\u00a35000) for his officers of State, while 500 camels were made over for the king\u2019s use. The Sh\u00e1h subsequently marched on his expedition against Kandah\u00e1r, but being defeated by Dost Mu\u1e25ammad, he retreated to Sind and proceeded to Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d, where he obtained sufficient money from the M\u00edrs to enable him to return to Ludhi\u00e1na, in the Punjab.\n\nIn 1843, on the conquest of the Province by the British, all Northern Sind, with the exception of that portion held by the Khairpur M\u00edr, Al\u00ed Mur\u00e1d Talpur, was formed into the Shik\u00e1rpur Collectorate and the Frontier District. In the previous year (1842), the towns of Sukkur, Bukkur, and Rohri had by treaty been ceded to the British in perpetuity. In 1851, M\u00edr Al\u00ed Mur\u00e1d Talpur of Khairpur was, after a full and public inquiry, convicted of acts of forgery and fraud, in unlawfully retaining certain lands and territories which belonged of right to the British Government. The forgery consisted in his having destroyed a leaf of the Kur\u00e1n in which the Naun\u00e1har, concluded in 1842 between himself and his brothers, M\u00edrs Nasir and Mub\u00e1rak Kh\u00e1n, was written, and having substituted for it another leaf, in which the word \u2018village\u2019 was altered to \u2018district,\u2019 by which he fraudulently obtained possession of several large districts instead of villages of the same name. On 1st January 1852, the Governor-General of India (Marquis Dalhousie) issued a proclamation depriving the M\u00edr of the districts wrongfully retained, and degrading him from the rank of Rais (or Lord Paramount). Of the districts so confiscated, Ubauro, B\u00faldika, M\u00edrpur, Said\u00e1b\u00e1d, and other parts of Upper Sind on the left bank of the Indus,\nnow forming the greater part of the Rohri Sub-division, were added to the Shikarpur Collectorate.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The population of Shikarpur District, according to the Census of 1872, numbered 776,227; and according to that of 1881, 852,986, scattered over an area of 10,001 square miles, inhabiting 6 towns and 1367 villages, and dwelling in 137,702 houses. Total increase of population in the nine years, 76,759, or 9.88 per cent. The Census of 1881 gives the following results\u2014Persons per square mile, 85.2; villages per square mile, 0.13; persons per village, 621; and persons per house, 6.1. Classified according to sex\u2014males number 461,033, and females 391,953; proportion of males, 54.05 per cent. Classified according to age, there were\u2014under 15 years, boys 189,272, and girls 153,962; total children, 343,234, or 40 per cent.: 15 years and upwards, males 271,761, and females 237,990; total adults, 509,751, or 60 per cent. of the population.\n\nAs regards religious distinctions, Shikarpur is an essentially Muhammadan District, the Census showing a total of 684,275 Muhammadans, as against 93,341 Hindus. The Muhammadans include 679,132 Sunnis, 5142 Shi\u00e1s, and 1 Wah\u00e1b\u00ed. Divided into tribes, there were 132,301 Bal\u00fach\u00eds, 6539 Path\u00e1ns, 13,158 Sayyids, 17,313 Shaikhs, 492,733 Sindh\u00eds, 22,231 \u2018other\u2019 Muhammadans. The Hindus include 3336 Br\u00e1hmans, 271 R\u00e1jputs, 77,491 Loh\u00e1nas, and 12,243 \u2018other\u2019 Hindus; 5892 are returned as aboriginal tribes; while 736 Christians, 64 P\u00e1rs\u00eds, 9 Jews, 68,655 Sikhs, 6 Buddhists, and 8 Brahmos complete the total.\n\nAs regards occupation, the male population is divided by the Census into the following main groups:\u2014(1) Professional class, including civil and military, 7124; (2) domestic servants, inn and lodging-house keepers, 5305; (3) commercial class, including bankers, merchants, carriers, etc., 8866; (4) agricultural and pastoral class, including gardeners, 165,440; (5) industrial class, including all manufacturers and artisans, 55,174; (6) indefinite and non-productive class, comprising general labourers, male children, and persons of unspecified occupation, 219,124.\n\nOf the 1373 towns and villages in the District, 468 contain less than two hundred inhabitants; 431 between two and five hundred; 251 between five hundred and one thousand; 161 between one and two thousand; 43 between two and three thousand; 12 between three and five thousand; 3 between five and ten thousand; 2 between ten and fifteen thousand; and 2 between twenty and fifty thousand. The chief towns are\u2014Shikarpur, population (1881) 42,496; Sukkur, 27,389; Larkhana, 13,188; Rohri, 10,224; Kambar, 6133; and Garhi Yasin, 5541. The above-named six towns, together with Ghotki, population 3240; Rato-Dero, 3170; Ubauro, 2267; Mehar, 1944; and Khairpur Natheshah, are municipalities: total income (1883\u201384),\n\u00a328,488; incidence of taxation varied from 8\u00bdd. to 5s. 2\u00bdd. per head in different towns.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Agriculture supported (1881) 465,522 persons, or 54\u00b758 per cent. of the population; only 181,679 were agricultural workers. In 1883\u201384, in the Government villages of the District, 660,016 acres were cultivated land bearing assessment and in occupation; 336,354 acres were fallow; while 242,739 acres, though cultivable and assessed, were not in occupation. The area under actual cultivation was 579,527 acres, of which 113,715 acres were twice cropped. Cereals and millets occupied 512,570 acres, of which nearly half, or 234,617 acres, were under rice; pulses, 110,912 acres; orchards, 4235 acres; drugs and narcotics, 3460 acres, chiefly tobacco; sugar-cane, 726 acres; oil-seeds, 44,883 acres; indigo, 2780 acres; fibres, 7985 acres, nearly all under cotton; and \u2018other\u2019 products, 5691 acres. The prices of agricultural produce, per maund of 80 lbs., ruling during 1883\u201384, were as follows\u2014wheat, 5s. 7d.; barley, 3s.; best rice, 6s. 10\u00bcd.; common rice, 5s. 1d.; bajra (Pennisetum typhoideum), 3s. 3\u00bcd.; jo\u00e1r (Sorghum vulgare), 3s. 1\u00bed.; gram, 3s. 10d.; salt, 5s. 10d.; flour, 6s. 6\u00bcd.; d\u00e1l (split-peas), 6s. 4\u00bed.; ghi, \u00a32, 9s. 0\u00bcd. The wages of skilled labour were in the same period 2s. per day; of unskilled labour, 7\u00bdd. Cart hire, 2s. a day; camel hire, 5d. a day for baggage camels, and 1s. 0\u00bed. a day for riding camels.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014In 1874, the Indus inundated a large portion of the District, breaching the railway and other embankments. The flood waters reached their greatest height from the 14th to 16th August, but began steadily to subside about the 27th of that month. No less than 536 villages were flooded, and several Government buildings were washed away. The floods of 1874 were from 5 to 8 feet higher than those which occurred in 1872. The net loss to Government in Mehar Sub-division alone was estimated at \u00a315,000.\n\nCommerce and Trade, etc.\u2014The Sind, Punjab, and Delhi (now the North-Western State) Railway runs through the District, from S\u00edt\u00e1 to Reti, for about 170 miles, with 22 stations, the principal ones being Radhan, Ruk junction, Sukkur, where it crosses the Indus to Rohr\u00ed on the opposite bank, and Reti. The Sind-Pishin Railway, starting from Ruk junction, crosses the District boundary a little beyond Jacob\u00e1b\u00e1d, a distance of about 40 miles, with 4 stations. But the facilities for trade afforded by the railway have not materially affected the boat traffic on the Indus. The trade through the Bolan Pass passes through the District, and the value is estimated at from \u00a3250,000 to \u00a3300,000, large quantities of wheat being sent to Kar\u00e1chi. The principal manufactures are carpets and coarse cotton cloth.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The total revenue of Shik\u00e1rpur District in 1882\u201383 amounted to \u00a3234,792. The land revenue collected was \u00a3189,868; stamps, \u00a312,550; excise, \u00a312,120; and licence-tax, \u00a33800. The\nlocal fund revenue was \u00a313,920, while the 11 municipalities raised an income of \u00a323,050. Shik\u00e1rpur is administered by a Collector-Magistrate with assistants; the Civil and Sessions Judge has his head-quarters at Shik\u00e1rpur town. In 1882-83, there were 6 civil judges and 39 stipendiary magistrates in the District; maximum distance of a village from nearest court, 40 miles; average distance, 6 miles. The police force numbered in 1882-83, 1091 officers and men, showing 1 policeman to every 7\u00b75 square miles of area and to every 732 of the population. The police were maintained at a cost of \u00a320,097. Schools (1882-83), 116, with 8104 pupils.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate of Shik\u00e1rpur District is hot and dry, with a remarkable absence of air-currents during the inundation season; and it is, in consequence, very trying to a European constitution. The hot weather commences in April, and ends in October; it is generally ushered in by violent dust-storms; the cold season begins in November, and lasts till March. The maximum, minimum, and mean temperatures in the shade are on an average 100\u00b0, 61\u00b0, 81\u00b0 F. The average yearly rainfall, from the observations of 18 years ending 1881, is only 4\u00b793 inches. The diseases are principally malarious fevers and ulcers. Cholera occurs at times, chiefly in the months of June and July. In 1883-84, 15,865 births were registered, and 13,450 deaths, or 15\u00b777 per 1000. In the same year, 27,256 persons were vaccinated. [For further information regarding Shik\u00e1rpur District, see the Gazetteer of the Province of Sind, by Mr. A. W. Hughes (London, George Bell & Co., 1876, second edition).

Area, 487 square miles. Population (1872) 73,383; (1881) 75,112, namely, males 40,600, and females 34,512; occupying 11,187 houses, in 1 town and 66 villages. Hindus number 19,483; Muhammadans, 43,944; Sikhs, 10,816; non-Hindu aborigines, 766; Christians, 96; P\u00e1rsis, 6; Jew, 1. Area assessed for land revenue (1882-83), 37,409 acres, of which 31,007 acres were under cultivation. In 1883 the Sub-division contained 1 civil and 5 criminal courts; police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), 6; regular police, 367 men. Land revenue, \u00a39824.\n\nShik\u00e1rpur.\u2014Chief town of Shik\u00e1rpur District, Sind, Bombay Presidency. Lat. 27\u00b0 57' 14\" N., long. 68\u00b0 40' 26\" E.; connected by good roads and railway with Jacob\u00e1b\u00e1d, from which it is distant 26 miles south-east, with Sukkur (Sakkar) 23 miles north-west, and L\u00e1rkh\u00e1na 40 miles north-east. Situated in a tract of low-lying country, annually flooded by canals from the Indus, the nearest point of which\nriver is 18 miles west. The elevation of the town is only 194 feet above sea-level. Two branches of the Sind Canal\u2014the Chhota Beg\u00e1ri and the R\u00e1iswah\u2014flow on either side of the town, the former to the south, and the latter to the north. The soil in the immediate vicinity is very rich, and produces heavy crops of grain and fruit. Population (1881) 42,496, namely, males 22,889, and females 19,607. Hindus number 16,218; Muhammadans, 16,480; Christians, 70; P\u00e1rs\u00eds, 4; and \u2018others,\u2019 9724. Shik\u00e1rpur is the head-quarters of the principal Government officials of the District, and contains the usual public buildings, and is a station on the Sind-Pishin State Railway. The total number of police is 311. Municipal revenue (1883-84), \u00a36819; incidence of taxation, 2s. 9d. per head. The Municipal Act was brought into force in 1855, since which date great sanitary improvements have been effected. Before that time, Shik\u00e1rpur was notorious for its unsightly appearance. The Stewartganj Market (so called after a popular District officer) is a continuation of the old b\u00e1z\u00e1r, and is a commodious structure. To the east of the town are three large tanks, known as Sarwar Khan\u2019s, the Gillespie, and the Haz\u00e1ri tank.\n\nThe trade of Shik\u00e1rpur has long been famous, both under native and British rule. The town is situated on one of the great routes from Sind to Khoras\u00e1n via the Bol\u00e1n Pass, and its commerce in 1841 was thus described by Postans:\u2014\u2018Shik\u00e1rpur receives from Kar\u00e1chi, M\u00e1rw\u00e1r, M\u00falt\u00e1n (Mooltan), Bah\u00e1walpur, Khaipur, and Ludhi\u00e1na\u2014European piece-goods, raw silk, ivory, cochineal, spices of sorts, coarse cotton cloth, kinkhabs, manufactured silk, sugar-candy, cocoa-nuts, metals, kirami (groceries), drugs of sorts, indigo and other dyes, opium and saffron; from Kachhi, Khoras\u00e1n, and the north-west\u2014raw silk (Turkest\u00e1n), various kinds of fruit, madder, turquoises, antimony, medical herbs, sulphur, alum, saffron, assaf\u00e9tida, gums, cochineal, and horses. The exports from Shik\u00e1rpur are confined to the transmission of goods to Khoras\u00e1n through the Bol\u00e1n Pass, and a tolerable trade with Kachhi (B\u00e1gh, Gand\u00e1va, Kotri, and Dadar). They consist of indigo (the most important), henna, metals of all kinds, country coarse and fine cloths, European piece-goods (chintzes, etc.), M\u00falt\u00e1n\u00ed coarse cloth, silks (manufactured), groceries and spices, raw cotton, coarse sugar, opium, hemp-seed, shields, embroidered horse-cloths, and dry grains. The revenue of Shik\u00e1rpur derivable from trade amounted in 1840 to Rs. 54,736 (say \u00a35473), and other taxes and revenue from lands belonging to the town, Rs. 16,645 (say \u00a31664), making a total of Rs. 71,381 (say \u00a37138), which is divided among the Khaipur and Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d Talpur M\u00edrs in the proportion of three-sevenths and four-sevenths respectively.\u2019\n\nSince Postans wrote as above, Shik\u00e1rpur has lost much of its commercial importance owing to the opening of the Indus valley\nportion of the Sind, Punjab, and Delhi Railway. The returns furnished for the first edition of this work showed that in 1874 the imports of Shik\u00e1rpur were valued at \u00a3264,190; the exports, \u00a364,485. No later statistics are available. The principal manufactures are carpets and coarse cotton cloth. In the Government jail, postins or sheepskin coats, baskets, reed chairs covered with leather, carpets, tents, shoes, etc., are made by the prisoners. From Shik\u00e1rpur there are three postal routes, viz. to Jacob\u00e1b\u00e1d, to Sukkur, and southwards to L\u00e1rkh\u00e1na and Mehar. The town contains several vernacular schools, together with a high school.\n\n**Shik\u00e1rpur.**\u2014Flourishing town in Bulandshahr District, North-Western Provinces; situated in lat. 28\u00b0 17' N., and long. 78\u00b0 3' 15\" E., on the R\u00e1mgh\u00e1t road, 13 miles south-east of Bulandshahr town.

Founded about 1500 A.D. by Sikandar Lod\u00ed, as a hunting-lodge on a large scale, whence the town derives its name. An ancient mound, said to have been once known as T\u00e1lpat Nagari, is about 500 yards north of the town, with a remarkable building, called B\u00e1ra Khamba, or the Twelve Columns, containing 12 fine red-sandstone pillars, in the architectural style of the Emperor Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr. The earliest inscription records the name of Sayyid Fazl-ull\u00e1, son-in-law of the Emperor Farukhsiyy\u00e1r, with the date 1718. The town is surrounded by the ruins of an old fort. Residence of Chaudhri Lakshman Singh, an Honorary Magistrate, who was conspicuous for loyalty during the Mutiny in 1857. A small house-tax is raised for police and conservancy purposes.\n\n**Shik\u00e1rpur.\u2014T\u00e1luk** in Shimoga District, Mysore State.

Said to have been originally called Maliy\u00e1n-halli, and subsequently Mah\u00e1danpur.\nThe present name was given in the time of Haidar Ali, on account of the abundance of game found in the neighbourhood. The old fort is now in ruins. A festival held for three days in April is attended by 8000 persons. Weekly fair on Saturdays.\n\n**Shikoh\u00e1b\u00e1d.**\u2014South-western *tahsil* of M\u00e1inpuri District, North-Western Provinces. It is conterminous with Shikoh\u00e1b\u00e1d *pargan\u00e1*, and consists of an almost level plain, intersected by undulating sandhills, and much cut up by ravines along its southern border, where it abuts upon the river Jumna (Jamun\u00e1). The Sarsa river flows through the midst of the *tahsil*, and the East Indian Railway traverses it from end to end, with stations at Bhadan and Shikoh\u00e1b\u00e1d. It is also thoroughly opened by good roads in every direction. Canal irrigation is afforded by the Bhognipur branch of the Ganges Canal. Area, 293 square miles, or 187,588 acres, of which 200\u00bc square miles, or 128,172 acres, were returned as under cultivation at the time of the last land revenue settlement of the District in 1870; 8845 acres were cultivable, including 2629 acres under groves; 1288 acres were held free of revenue; and 49,283 acres were uncultivable waste. Population (1881) 144,882, namely, males 79,316, and females 65,566. Average density, 494\u00bd persons per square mile. Hindus number 132,434; Muhammadans, 11,374; Jains, 1065; and \u2018others,\u2019 9. Of the 284 towns and villages, 194 contain less than five hundred inhabitants; 63 between five hundred and a thousand; 26 between one and five thousand; and 1 between ten and fifteen thousand inhabitants. The principal crops are *b\u00e1jra*, *jo\u00e1r*, cotton, and sugar-cane for the *khar\u00edf*, and wheat, *bejh\u00e1r*, barley, and gram for the *r\u00e1b\u00ed* harvest. The former occupies about 60 and the latter 40 per cent. of the cultivated area. Land revenue (1882), \u00a327,625, or including local rates and cesses, \u00a330,958. In 1884, Shikoh\u00e1b\u00e1d *tahsil* contained 1 civil and 1 criminal court; number of police circles (*th\u00e1n\u00eds*), 2; regular police, 42 men; village watch or rural police (*chauk\u00edd\u00e1rs*), 370.\n\n**Shikoh\u00e1b\u00e1d.**\u2014Town in M\u00e1inpuri District, North-Western Provinces, and head-quarters of Shikoh\u00e1b\u00e1d *tahsil*; situated in lat. 27\u00b0 6' 5\" N., and long. 78\u00b0 38' 10\" E., on the Agra road, nearly 2 miles from Shikoh\u00e1b\u00e1d station on the East Indian Railway, and 34 miles west of M\u00e1inpuri town. Population (1881) 11,826, namely, males 6347, and females 5479. Hindus number 6741; Muhammadans, 4957; Jains, 122; and Christians, 6. The old town, a large straggling collection of houses, lies east and south of the main road; but the principal *b\u00e1z\u00e1r* lines the highway itself, and contains 9 *s\u00e1rd\u00eds* (native inns) for the accommodation of travellers. An ancient mound, once the site of the fort, is now covered by houses. The town contains numerous temples and mosques, and is the birthplace of several Hindu and Musalm\u00e1n saints. Handsome *tahsili*, police station, post-office, school; telegraph office at\nrailway station. Named after Prince D\u00e1ra Shikoh, traces of whose residence, garden, and wells still remain. The British obtained possession of Shikoh\u00e1b\u00e1d in 1801, and established a cantonment south of the town. In 1802, a Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 force under Fleury surprised the British detachment; after which the cantonment was removed to M\u00e1inpuri. Formerly a great emporium for raw cotton, but the trade has declined. Manufacture of sweetmeats and cotton cloth. A small house-tax is levied for police and conservancy purposes.\n\n**Shillong.**\u2014Chief town of the Kh\u00e1si and Jaintia Hills District, and administrative head-quarters of the Chief Commissioner of Assam; situated in lat. $25\u00b0\\ 32'39''$ N., and long. $91\u00b0\\ 55'32''$ E., on a table-land 4900 feet above sea-level, and 64 miles south by road from Gauh\u00e1t\u00ed (Gowhatty). Shillong first became the civil station of the Kh\u00e1si and Jaintia Hills in 1864, in substitution for Cherra Poonjee. In 1874, on the constitution of the Chief Commissionership of Assam, it was chosen as the head-quarters of the new administration, on account of its salubrity and its convenient position between the Brahmaputra and Surm\u00e1 valleys.\n\nThe Chief Commissioner permanently resides at Shillong, and also the heads of all the departments of Government. A considerable native population is already settled, which increases from year to year. Population (1872) 1363; (1881) 3640. Municipal taxation (1883\u201384), \u00a3374, or an average of 3s. 6d. per head of the population (2137) within municipal limits. Large sums of money have been expended on the erection of public buildings. A printing press has been established, from which issue all the official documents and reports of the Province. A church has been built, at which a chaplain officiates alternately with Gauh\u00e1t\u00ed. The nominal area of the station is 7 miles in length by $1\\frac{1}{2}$ mile broad. An excellent water-supply has been introduced through an aqueduct, which has its source in the neighbouring hill streams; the water is distributed by means of pipes to every house in the civil station, and by hydrants in the public b\u00e1z\u00e1rs and other convenient places. Sanitary measures are stringently enforced. The cart-road from Gauh\u00e1t\u00ed, the old capital of Assam on the Brahmaputra, was opened for traffic in 1877. The entire distance of 64 miles is now accomplished by tonga d\u00e1k in a single day; and the sanatorium is thus rendered easily accessible from the fever-stricken plains of the Brahmaputra valley. The gradients on this road are a model of engineering skill. In 1885, the cantonments at Shillong were occupied by the 42nd Regiment of Bengal Infantry, with 2 mountain guns. A large weekly market is held in the b\u00e1z\u00e1r. A model farm established in the neighbourhood in 1873 did not prove successful, either from a financial or an agricultural point of view, and has been abolished. (See *The Statistical Account of Assam*, vol. ii. p. 229.)\nThe climate of Shillong is singularly mild and equable. A temperature higher than 80\u00b0 F. is seldom recorded. Hoar-frost lies upon the ground almost every morning during the months of December, January, and February. Shallow water occasionally freezes over, but snow never falls. Fires are necessary from November to March or April, the fuel used being coal, obtained at great cost from the beds at M\u00e1o-beh-lyrkar. The price fluctuates much, depending on the cost of carriage; it has been known to reach as high as \u00a33 per ton. The rainfall registered during the fifteen years ending in 1881 averaged 87\u00b744 inches a year. The prevailing diseases are dysentery, bowel complaints, and disorders of the liver; but when once European residents have passed through a short period of acclimatizing indisposition, they generally enjoy excellent health.\n\n**Shillong.**\u2014Mountain range in the Kh\u00e1si and Jaintia Hills District, Assam, overlooking the station of the same name. The highest peak (lat. 25\u00b0 34' 18\" N., long. 91\u00b0 55' 43\" E.) attains a height of 6450 feet above the sea, being the most elevated point in the District. The crown of the ridge is covered with a sacred grove of large timber-trees. This peak is the site to which the name Shillong properly belongs; the neighbouring station is known to the natives as L\u00e1b\u00e1n, from a village of that name which adjoins it.\n\n**Shimoga.**\u2014District forming the north-western portion of the Nagar Division of Mysore, lying between 13\u00b0 30' and 14\u00b0 38' N. lat., and between 74\u00b0 44' and 76\u00b0 5' E. long. Area, 3797 square miles; population, according to the Census of 1881, 499,728 souls. Bounded along the north and west by the Districts of Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r and North K\u00e1nara, in the Bombay Presidency. The administrative head-quarters are at Shimoga Town, on the left bank of the Tunga river, just above its junction with the Bhadra.\n\n**Physical Aspects.**\u2014The District constitutes part of the principal watershed of Southern India. The river system is twofold\u2014the rivers in the east, the Tunga, the Bhadra, and the Varada uniting to form the Tungabhadra, which ultimately falls into the Kistna, and so into the Bay of Bengal; while in the west, a few minor streams break through the barrier of the Western Gh\u00e1ts and reach the K\u00e1nara coast. The whole region is covered with hills and valleys, but it naturally divides into two distinct portions. The larger half, towards the west, known as the Maln\u00e1d or hill country, gradually rises towards the Western Gh\u00e1ts, where isolated peaks attain a height of more than 4000 feet above sea-level. The general elevation of the District is about 2100 feet; and towards the east it opens out into the Maid\u00e1n or plain country, which forms part of the general plateau of Mysore. The Maln\u00e1d presents a wealth of picturesque scenery and wild life. A park of giant timber-trees, overgrown with brilliant creepers, extends continuously for miles,\nonly interrupted by glades of verdant grass; the towering mountains form a precipitous background; and wild animals of all kinds abound.\n\nNear the north-western frontier of the District, the Sharavat\u012b river bursts through the Western Gh\u00e1ts by the celebrated Falls of Gersoppa, which surpass any other waterfall in India, and, in the combined attributes of height, volume of water, and picturesque situation, have few rivals in the world. The river here is 250 yards wide, and throws itself over a chasm 960 feet in depth in four distinct falls, one of which has an unbroken descent of 830 feet.\n\nThe mineral products include iron-ore, and laterite for building. Magnetic stones, occasionally found on the summits of the Gh\u00e1ts, are highly prized. In the valleys of the Maln\u00e1d, the soil is a loose, sandy loam, very suitable for rice; in the north-east appears the black cotton-soil. The wealth of timber in the Maln\u00e1d remains as yet unproductive, owing to the inaccessible nature of the country. The more valuable trees include p\u00fan (Colophyllum tomentosum), wild jack, ebony, som (Prosopis spicigera), the large devad\u00e1ram (Erythroxylon monogynum), gamboge, and a species of cedar. In the centre of the District are found teak, sandal-wood, the areca, cocoa-nut, and sago palms, bamboo, cardamoms, and the pepper vine. Farther to the east, large trees altogether disappear. An area of about 35 square miles has been reserved by the Forest Department, including a teak plantation; and trees in avenues are planted along the public roads. Among wild animals, bison are especially numerous in the t\u00e1luk of S\u00e1gar, where wild elephants are also occasionally seen. Tigers, leopards, bears, wild hog, s\u00e1mbhar and chit\u00edl deer, and jungle sheep are common in the wooded tracts.\n\nHistory.\u2014The present area of Shimoga District has supplied more than one important city to Southern India. The oldest memorials are three copper plates, purporting to be land-grants of Janamej\u00e1ya, the monarch to whom the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata was recited. Considerable doubt has been thrown upon the genuineness of these inscriptions; and the dates to which they have been referred belong to legend rather than to history. Janamej\u00e1ya is assigned to 1300 B.C. One of the plates bears the date 89 of the Yudishthira era, which would be equivalent to 3012 B.C., according to Mr. Lewis Rice.\n\nLocal history commences with the Kadambas, whose capital was at Banavasi, on the north-western frontier of this District, and whose dominions extended over great part of K\u00e1nara and Mysore. Banavasi is identified as one of the spots visited by a Buddhist missionary in 245 B.C., and as mentioned by the Greek geographer Ptolemy in the 2nd century A.D. In the 6th century, the Kadambas were overthrown by the Chalukya kings, under whom they long continued to govern as feudatories; and at about the same time a petty Jain kingdom was established at Humcha. The Chalukyas were in their turn expelled by the\nKalachuryas, under whose protection the Ling\u00e1yat religion became predominant in K\u00e1nara.\n\nShimoga District subsequently was included within the dominions of the Hoysala Ball\u00e1las and the kings of Vijayanagar, who were successively suzerains over all Southern India. At the time of the decadence of the latter empire, many local chiefs or p\u00e1leg\u00e1rs succeeded in asserting their independence, among whom the Keladi and the Basvapatna families divided between them the area of this District. The Keladi family, who were Ling\u00e1yats, first established themselves at Ikkeri about 1560, and subsequently transferred their residence to Bedn\u00far, better known by the honorific appellation of Nagar. At one time they attained great power; but they were finally conquered by Haidar Al\u00ed in 1763, when their territory was annexed to Mysore. The Basvapatna chiefs were a less influential family, whose capital was at Tarikere, in the adjoining District at K\u00e1d\u00far. They also fell before the organized empire of Haidar Al\u00ed in 1761.\n\nAfter the death of Tip\u00fa, and the re-establishment of the old Hindu dynasty of Mysore in 1799, Shimoga District repeatedly became the scene of disturbances, caused by the mal-administration of the Deshasta Br\u00e1hmans, who had seized on the offices of government, and made themselves obnoxious to both the Ling\u00e1yats and the cultivators. These disturbances culminated in the rebellion of 1830, led by representatives of the old Keladi and Basvapatna families, which occasioned the direct assumption of the administration of the entire State by the British.\n\nPopulation.\u2014In 1838, a Report by Mr. Stokes estimated the population of the District to be 304,120 souls; and a kh\u00e1na sum\u00e1ri or house enumeration, in 1853\u201354, returned a total of 427,179. The regular Census of 1871 ascertained the number to be 498,976, showing an increase of 64 per cent. in the interval of thirty-three years, and nearly 17 per cent. in the later period of eighteen years, if the earlier estimates can be trusted. The last Census of 1881 returned the population at 499,728, namely, males 259,296, females 240,432; density of population, 132 persons per square mile; villages per square mile, 0\u00b752; houses per square mile, 24\u00b79; persons per house, 5\u00b785. The District contained 1973 towns and villages, consisting of 85,365 occupied and 9185 unoccupied houses. Classified according to sex and age, there were\u2014under 15 years of age, boys 94,781, and girls 93,123; total children, 187,904, or 37\u00b76 per cent. of the District population. The adults numbered, males 164,515, and females 147,309; total, 311,824, or 62\u00b74 per cent.\n\nThe religious division of the people shows\u2014Hindus, 470,678, or 94\u00b72 per cent.; Muhammadans, 27,574, or 5\u00b75 per cent.; and Christians, 1476. The Br\u00e1hmans number 25,584, of whom the great majority belong to the Smarta sect; those claiming the rank of Kshattriyas are\nreturned at 14,694, including 13,429 Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s and 1265 R\u00e1jputs; the Vaisyas are poorly represented by only 1106 persons, all Komatis. Of inferior castes, the most numerous are Wokligas (68,219), who are agricultural labourers; Idigas (58,252), whose caste occupation is that of toddy-drawers; and Vadd\u00e1rs (13,467), of whom many are also cultivators. The Ling\u00e1yats, who have always been influential in this part of the country, number 51,504; agricultural castes, 26,861; Kunchigars (brass and coppersmiths), 11,186; Kurub\u00e1s (shepherds), 21,792; Upp\u00e1rs (salt-makers), 8815; Tigl\u00e1rs (market gardeners), 236; Goll\u00e1rs (cowherds), 3009; Bed\u00e1rs (hunters), 21,010; Best\u00e1rs (fishermen), 13,331; Banaj\u00edg\u00e1rs (traders), 3282; Neyig\u00e1s (weavers), 21,866; Kumbh\u00e1rs (potters), 3604; Agas\u00e1s (washermen), 11,864; Darj\u00eds (tailors), 888; N\u00e1pits (barbers), 2777; Ganig\u00e1rs (oil-pressers), 825; Myad\u00e1rs, 3046. Out-castes are returned at 61,472; wandering tribes, 10,726.\n\nThe Musalm\u00e1ns, who muster strongest in the t\u00e1luk of Shimoga, are mostly all described as Deccani Musalm\u00e1ns of the Sunn\u00ed sect. Shi\u00e1s number 388; Wah\u00e1b\u00eds, 5; Daira or Mahadavi, 45; and \u2018others,\u2019 604. Out of the total of 1476 Christians, 34 were Europeans and 51 Eurasians (chiefly residing on the coffee plantations), leaving 1391 for the native converts. According to another principle of classification, 100 are Protestants and 1376 Roman Catholics.\n\nWith reference to occupation, the Census distributed the male population into the following six main groups:\u2014(1) Professional, civil, and military class, 8433; (2) domestic servants, inn and lodging keepers, 1535; (3) commercial class, including bankers, merchants, and carriers, 6523; (4) agricultural and pastoral class, including gardeners, 131,477; (5) industrial class, including all manufacturers and artisans, 10,693; and (6) indefinite and non-productive class, comprising general labourers, male children, and persons of unspecified occupation, 100,635.\n\nThe District contains 1973 populated towns and villages, with a few houses of the better class, or over \u00a350 in value. Of the total number of towns and villages, 1099 contain less than two hundred inhabitants; 626 from two to five hundred; 205 from five hundred to one thousand; 34 from one to two thousand; 7 from two to three thousand; 1 from three to five thousand; and 1 from ten to fifteen thousand. The only place in the District with more than 5000 inhabitants is SHIMOGA Town, the head-quarters of the District, on the Tunga river; population (1881) 12,040. Its prosperity dates from the introduction of British rule. There are many sites of ruined cities in the District, which have been already alluded to. The chief are\u2014Nagar or Bedn\u00far, Ikkeri, and Keladi, all associated with a family of Ling\u00e1yat p\u00e1leg\u00e1rs; Basvapatna, the early residence of the Tarikere chiefs; the Jain ruins of Humcha;\nand Banavasi, with its Buddhist memorials. The most important modern towns, after Shimoga itself, are Chennagiri and Sagar. There are altogether ten municipalities in the District, with an aggregate municipal income, in 1881-82, of \u00a32249.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014The staple food crop of the District is rice, which is especially cultivated in the terraced valleys of the Malnad or hill country. The names of 60 different varieties are enumerated. The crop is sown from April to July, and reaped from November to February. In some tracts, the cultivation of 'dry crops' predominates. Of these, ragi (Eleusine coracana) is preferred by the natives for their own food, while rice is largely exported. Next to rice, the most important crop is sugar-cane, which is largely grown in the taluk of Shikarpur. The canes are planted from January to June, and gathered after a full twelve months. The juice is for the most part converted into jaggery. The tract about Nagar produces the finest areca-nuts in Mysore. Miscellaneous crops include oil-seeds, a great variety of vegetables and fruits, pepper, and cardamoms. The coffee zone of the District is estimated to extend over 1000 square miles, but a considerable portion of this area is not of the most favourable character. There are altogether 250 plantations, of which 6 are owned by Europeans. In 1861, an unsuccessful attempt was made to improve the indigenous production of cotton, by the distribution of American seed.\n\nThe following agricultural statistics are merely approximate:\u2014Out of the total area of 3797 square miles, only 1110 were returned in 1880-81 as under cultivation, and 433 as cultivable. The area under rice is 209,217 acres, with an out-turn valued at more than \u00a3335,000; other food-grains, 303,908 acres; cotton, 921; cocoa-nut and areca-nut, 16,942; coffee, 4846; sugar-cane, 7245; oil-seeds, 6000; fibres, 1600; tobacco, 500; vegetables, 762; pepper, 532 acres: total area under actual cultivation, 552,473 acres. Average rent per acre for rice land, 9s.; wheat land, 6s.; land producing inferior grains, 9d.; cotton, 3s.; oil-seeds, 3s. 3d.; fibres, 3s. 6d.; sugar-cane, 4s.; and tobacco, 5s. Average produce of rice land per acre, 671 lbs.; wheat, 40 lbs.; inferior food-grains, 671 lbs.; cotton, 29 lbs.; oil-seeds, 170 lbs.; fibres, 500 lbs.; sugar, 360 lbs.; tobacco, 240 lbs.; and coffee, 34 lbs. Current prices per maund of 80 lbs.\u2014rice, 4s. 1\u00bdd.; wheat, 4s. 9d.; cotton, \u00a31, 17s. 7\u00bdd.; salt, 8s. 11\u00bdd.; gram, from 3s. 2\u00bdd. to 4s. 9\u00bdd.; ragi, 1s. 5\u00bdd.; dill, 5s. 10\u00bed.; tobacco, \u00a33, 7s. 6d.; unrefined sugar, 8s.; gh\u00ee, the Indian substitute for butter, lard, etc., \u00a32, 9s. 2\u00bdd. A plough bullock costs from \u00a32 to \u00a320; sheep, from 4s. to \u00a31. Iron sells at 12s. per 80 lbs. Skilled labour costs 1s. 3d. to 2s.; unskilled labour from 6d. to 1s. The hire of a cart per day is 1s. 6d. to 2s.; of a donkey, 7\u00bdd. to 1s.; of a boat, 1s. to 2s.\n\nIrrigation is carried on both from tanks and from channels artificially\ndrawn from the rivers by means of anicuts or weirs. The total number of tanks is 8313, including the great reservoir of Sulekere, in the t\u012bluk of Chennagiri, which is 40 miles in circumference, and ranks as the second largest in Southern India. In this same neighbourhood are to be found the best cattle in the District; and there are several grazing-grounds for the amrita mah\u0101l, or royal breed maintained by the State. Buffaloes are largely used for agricultural purposes, and pack-bullocks are bred to carry the through traffic across the Gh\u0101ts. The returns of 1880\u201381 showed a total of 401,153 cows and bullocks, and 47,643 sheep and goats; horses, 316; ponies, 2091; donkeys, 2317; and pigs, 2678.\n\nManufactures, etc.\u2014The chief industries in the District are the weaving of coarse cotton-cloth and rough country blankets or kamblis, and the making of iron implements, brass-ware, pottery, and jaggery from the sugar-cane. Oil is expressed from a great variety of vegetable products. At certain localities are special manufactures of striped carpets, chintz, coarse brown paper, stone jugs, and rope from various fibres. The carving of sandal-wood constitutes a speciality of the g\u016bd\u012b-g\u0101rs of Sor\u00e1b, whose delicate and elaborate workmanship is considered superior to that of either Bombay or Canton. The chief articles turned out are caskets and cabinets, ornamented either with leaves and figures from the Hindu pantheon, or with a copy of any design that may be ordered. Carving of inferior merit is also produced in other villages. The manufacturing stock of the District is returned at 1205 looms, and 63 oil-mills.\n\nThe trade of Shimoga is conducted with both the east and west coasts, and also with Bangalore. The chief exports are rice and other food-grains, jaggery from the sugar-cane, areca-nuts, coffee, pepper, and iron articles. The imports received in exchange are European piece-goods, copper vessels, oils of various kinds, tobacco, betel-leaf, and gold and silver ornaments. There are four passes across the Western Gh\u0101ts, of which the two most important leave the District near the Falls of Gersoppa and at the town of Agumbi. The local trade is mostly in the hands of the Ling\u0101yats, whose centres of operation are at S\u0101gar, Tirthahalli, and Nyampti. There are five weekly fairs, each attended by more than 1000 people; and several annual religious festivals, at which much buying and selling is done. There is no railway in the District. The returns furnished for the first edition of this work showed an aggregate length of State roads of 225 miles, maintained at an annual cost of \u00a33425; District roads, 171 miles, costing \u00a3971.\n\nAdministration.\u2014In 1881\u201382, the total revenue of Shimoga District, excluding education and public works, amounted to \u00a3190,941. The chief items were, land revenue, \u00a3120,467; s\u0101yar or customs, \u00a327,870;\nforests, \u00a3955. The District is now divided into 9 taluks or fiscal divisions, with 50 hoblis or minor fiscal units. In 1881-82, the total number of estates on the register was 96,557. The District in 1883 contained 3 civil and 6 criminal courts. During the year 1881, the average daily prison population of the District jail was 343\u00b782; and of the taluk lock-ups, 81\u00b785: total, 425\u00b767, of whom 18\u00b778 were women, showing 1 person in jail to every 1173 of the population. In the same year, the District police force numbered 18 officers and 458 men; and the municipal police, 1 officer and 34 men: total, 511 men of all ranks, maintained at a cost of \u00a34912. These figures show 1 policeman to every 8 square miles of area or to every 978 of the population; the cost being \u00a31, 5s. per square mile and 2d. per head of population.\n\nThe number of schools aided and inspected by Government in 1881 was 114, attended by 4462 pupils, being 1 school to every 33 square miles, and 9 pupils to every 1000 of the population. Of the schools, three were for girls, attended by 168 pupils. Besides these schools, there was a jail school attended by 148 scholars; and a college. The Census of 1881 returned 8674 boys and 327 girls as under instruction, together with 19,888 males and 274 females able to read and write. The returns furnished for the first edition of this work showed, in addition to the aided and inspected schools, 80 indigenous schools, with 1009 pupils.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014Shimoga District offers great varieties of climate. The Gh\u00e1ts on the western frontier are in some places only 8 miles distant from the sea; and here the south-west monsoon strikes with its full force, bringing a rainfall of more than 150 inches in the year. But the District stretches from the Gh\u00e1ts for about 100 miles towards the central table-land of Southern India; and the rainfall gradually diminishes, until it only amounts to about 25 inches at Chennagiri, most of which falls in October during the north-east monsoon. The sea-breeze from the west is distinctly felt as far as Shimoga town. During the two years 1873 and 1874, the maximum temperature registered was 92\u00b0 F. in the month of April, and the minimum 75\u00b0 F. in December. In 1881, the maximum in April was 99\u00b0 F.; the minimum in January, 70\u00b0 F. The average rainfall at Shimoga town, calculated over a period of forty-four years ending 1881, was 29\u00b726 inches; but as much as 170 inches has been known to fall within the year at Nagar.\n\nMalarious fever of a persistent type prevails in the Maln\u00e1d or hill country; and the natives appear to be even more exposed to its attacks than Europeans, when once the latter have become acclimatized. The vital statistics are far from trustworthy; but it may be mentioned that, out of the total of 10,843 deaths reported in 1881-82, 6061 were assigned to fevers, 1083 to bowel complaints, 204 to small-pox, 21 to snake-\nbite or wild beasts, and 21 to suicide, 6 to woundings, 54 to accidents, and 3407 to other causes. In 1874, the dispensary at Shimoga town was attended by 302 in-patients, and by 9963 out-patients.

The hill, crowned with a temple of Mah\u00e1deo, to which the village owes its celebrity, appears like the point of a very obtuse-angled cone. The great fair is held in March-April. The attendance sometimes reaches 50,000. Great pains are taken as to the\nsanitary arrangements during the fair. Government provides a hospital assistant at the expense of the municipality. Care is taken to prevent the water from pollution. The transactions are valued at \u00a35000. The Bhaw\u00e1ni Gh\u00e1t road which connects this town with Nate-Pute, a trade centre in Shol\u00e1pur District, is under construction. Municipal income (1883-84), \u00a3614; incidence of taxation, rs. 4\u00bdd. per head of population.\n\nShin-maw.\u2014Pagoda on Tavoy Point, Tenasserim Division, Lower Burma. Founded in 1204 A.D. by Nara-pad-di-si-thu, king of Burma, when he visited this part of his dominions. It is highly reverenced as containing a tooth of Gautama.\n\nShin-mut-ti.\u2014The most famous pagoda in Tavoy District, Tenasserim Division, Lower Burma, 58 feet high and 308 feet in circumference at the base.

Area, 651 square miles. Population (1872) 34,642; (1881) 43,321, namely, males 22,356, and females 20,965; occupying 6765 houses, in 1 town and 98 villages. Hindus number 34,817; Muhammadans, 2859; and 'others,' 5645. A broken range of the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1s, running from east to west, divides this Sub-division into two parts, each with distinct natural features. The northern part comprises a wild and hilly country sparsely peopled by Bhils. The southern is an unbroken plain,\nwith no trees except near village sites. The population is dense near the banks of the T\u00e1pti, but becomes scanty as the hills are approached. Although the Sub-division has three rivers that run throughout the year\u2014the T\u00e1pti, forming the southern boundary for 26 miles, and its tributaries the Anar and the Arun\u00e1vat\u00ed, and numerous other streams from the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1s\u2014the supply of surface water is on the whole scanty. The prevailing black soil is a rich loam resting on a yellowish subsoil.\n\nIn 1865\u201366, the year of settlement, 3500 holdings (kh\u00e1t\u00e1s) were recorded, with an average area of 20\u00b79 acres, and an average rental of \u00a33, 1s. 10\u00bdd. In 1878\u201379, the area under actual cultivation was 87,635 acres. Cereals and millets occupied 58,193 acres; pulses, 3386 acres; oil-seeds, 9539 acres; fibres, 15,583 acres; and miscellaneous crops, 934 acres. In 1883 the Sub-division contained 1 civil and 2 criminal courts; police circle (th\u00e1nd), 1; regular police, 42 men; village watch (chaukid\u00e1rs), 132. Land revenue, \u00a314,327.\n\nShirpur Sub-division was in 1370 granted in j\u00e1gir by Firoz Tughlak, the Emperor of Delhi, to Malik R\u00e1j\u00e1, founder of the Kh\u00e1ndesh kingdom. In 1785 it became part of Holk\u00e1r\u2019s possessions. In 1818 it was ceded to the British.\n\n**Shirpur.**\u2014Town in Kh\u00e1ndesh District, Bombay Presidency, and head-quarters of Shirpur Sub-division. Situated 30 miles north of Dhulia, in lat. 21\u00b0 21' N., and long. 74\u00b0 57' E. Population (1881) 7613, namely, Hindus, 6116; Muhammadans, 1024; Jains, 247; and \u2018others,\u2019 226. Shirpur suffered severely in the floods of 1875, when water stood in places six feet deep, destroying property to the value of \u00a33200. Municipal income (1883\u201384), \u00a3373; incidence of taxation, 9\u00bdd. per head of population. Sub-judge\u2019s court, post-office, school, dispensary, rest-house.\n\n**Shiur\u00e1jpur.**\u2014Tahsil in Cawnpur District, North-Western Provinces, conterminous with Shiur\u00e1jpur pargan\u00e1, lying along the south-west bank of the Ganges, and traversed by several distributaries of the Ganges Canal. Of the total cultivated area, 23 per cent. is watered from these channels, and a good deal of d\u00famat soil in the south of the tahsil has been improved by the substitution of canal for jh\u00edl or marsh irrigation. Notwithstanding the abundance of canal water, wells are extensively used. Excepting in the tract along the cliff of the Ganges, where, owing to the elevation of the surface, water lies at a great depth, the sub-strata are so sandy and treacherous as to render well-digging a perilous venture; while the unevenness of the ground prevents the spread of canal irrigation in this direction. The East Indian Railway passes through the southern corner of the tahsil, with a station at Bh\u00e1npur. Shiur\u00e1jpur is connected with Cawnpur by the Grand Trunk Road, and the tahsil is well provided with roads.\n\nArea, 264 square miles, of which 132 square miles are cultivated.\nThe chief autumn crops consist of cotton, jo\u00e1r, and indigo, and the spring crops of wheat and b\u00e1jra. Poppy, tobacco, and p\u00e1n are largely grown. Population (1881) 150,728, namely, males 79,485, and females 71,243. Average density of population, 570'9 persons per square mile. Classified according to religion, Hindus number 144,621, and Muhammadans 6107. Of the 320 towns and villages in the tahsil, 225 contain less than five hundred inhabitants; 61 between five hundred and a thousand; and 34 between one and five thousand. Land revenue, \u00a327,409; total Government revenue, including rates and cesses, \u00a330,698. Rental paid by cultivators, \u00a349,868. In 1885, Sh\u00edur\u00e1jpur tahsil contained 2 criminal courts, and 2 police stations (th\u00e1n\u00e1s); strength of regular police, 31 men; village watch or rural police (chank\u00edd\u00e1rs), 271.\n\nSh\u00edur\u00e1jpur.\u2014Town in Cawnpur District, North-Western Provinces, and head-quarters of Sh\u00edur\u00e1jpur tahsil; situated on the Grand Trunk Road, 21 miles north-west of Cawnpur city. Population (1872), including the neighbouring villages of R\u00e1jpur and Barr\u00e1jpur, 7883. Not returned separately in the Census of 1881. Besides the Sub-divisional courts and offices, the town contains a police station, post-office, and Government school. A fort, formerly the seat of a Chandela R\u00e1j\u00e1, was razed to the ground after the chief's rebellion in 1857-58.\n\nSh\u00edur\u00e1jpur.\u2014Small village and station on the East Indian Railway in Bara tahsil, All\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d District, North-Western Provinces. Population (1881) 477. Noted for its stone quarries. Rising market; post-office; police station.\n\nSh\u00edur\u00e1jpur.\u2014Village in Kali\u00e1npur tahsil, Fatehpur District, North-Western Provinces; situated in lat. 26\u00b0 10' 20\" N., and long. 80\u00b0 38' 30\" E., on the Ganges, 22 miles from Fatehpur town. Population (1881) 1425, chiefly Br\u00e1hmans. The village is the site of the largest fair in the District, which is held on the occasion of the Purnam\u00e1si festival in October-November.\n\nShivag\u00e1ng\u00e1.\u2014Zamind\u00e1ri and town in Madura District, Madras Presidency.\u2014See SIVAGANGA.\n\nShivag\u00e1ng\u00e1.\u2014Hill in Bangalore District, Mysore.\u2014See SIVAGANGA.\n\nSh\u00edvbara.\u2014Petty Bhil State in Kh\u00e1ndesh District, Bombay Presidency.\u2014See DANG STATES.\n\nShivg\u00e1on.\u2014Sub-division of Ahmadnagar District, Bombay Presidency. Area, 670 square miles. Population (1881) 87,113, namely, males 44,093, and females 43,020; occupying 16,100 houses, in 1 town and 179 villages. Hindus number 79,208; Muhammadans, 5776; and 'others,' 2129. Shivg\u00e1on is the most easterly Sub-division of the District. With one or two exceptions, the streams which drain the tract all rise in the hills on the south and south-east, and flow northward into the God\u00e1vari. The villages are for the most part\nwell supplied with water, which throughout the low grounds is always to be found at a moderate depth. Near the God\u00e1vari, the soil is deep and stiff, but near the hills it is of a lighter composition, and more easily worked. Early and late crops are grown in about equal proportions. In 1881\u201382, the actual area under cultivation was 222,759 acres. Cereal and millets occupied 177,102 acres; pulses, 17,612 acres; fibres, 19,531 acres; oil-seeds, 7001 acres; and miscellaneous crops, 1513 acres. About 3000 looms are worked in the Sub-division, of which about 2000 are in the town of P\u00e1thardi, and 200 in Tisg\u00e1on. The principal manufacture is of various kinds of cotton cloth, mostly coarse. In 1883 the Sub-division contained 2 civil and 2 criminal courts; police circle (th\u00e1n\u00e1), 1; regular police, 34 men; village watch (chauk\u00edd\u00e1rs), 272. Land revenue, \u00a319,914.\n\n**Shivg\u00e1on.**\u2014Town in Ahmadnagar District, Bombay Presidency, and head-quarters of Shivg\u00e1on Sub-division; situated 40 miles northeast of Ahmadnagar city, in lat. 19\u00b0 21' N., and long. 75\u00b0 18' E. Population (1881) 2948. Shivg\u00e1on is a ruined town on a wide plain; joined with Paithan and Ahmadnagar by a good road. It is surrounded by a wall. Sub-divisional offices, post-office, dispensary, school, temples, and weekly market on Sundays.\n\n**Shivner.**\u2014Hill fort of the town of Junnar, in Poona (P\u00fana) District, Bombay Presidency; situated not far from Harischandragarh, and about 50 miles north of Poona city. The hill of Shivner rises over a thousand feet, and stretches about a mile across the plain. It is triangular in shape, narrowing from a southern base of about 800 yards to a point of rock in the north. Near the south, the lower slopes of its eastern face are crossed by a belt of rock 40 or 50 feet high. The south-west of the hill is broken, and from about half-way up is strengthened by outworks and bastioned walls. Shivner is interesting as having been the birthplace of Sivaji the Great.\n\nDuring the first and second, and probably the third century after Christ, the hill seems to have been a great Buddhist centre. About 50 cells and chapels remain. They are found on three sides of the hill, but most of them are cut in its eastern face. Shivner was granted in 1599 to Sivaji\u2019s grandfather, M\u00e1loji Bhonsla; and here, in 1627, Sivaji was born. It was often taken and retaken; and once, in 1670, the forces of Sivaji himself were beaten back by its Mughal garrison. Besides its five gates and solid fortifications, it is celebrated for its deep springs. They rise in pillared tanks of great depth, supposed by Dr. Gibson to be coeval with the series of Buddhist caves which pierce the lower portion of the scarp. The fort commands the road leading to the N\u00e1negh\u00e1t and M\u00e1lsejgh\u00e1t, formerly the chief line of communication between this part of the Deccan and the coast. [For further information respecting Shivner fort and caves, see the *Gazetteer of the*\nShiyali (Siyali).\u2014T\u00e1luk or Sub-division of Tanjore District, Madras Presidency. Area, 159 square miles. Population (1881) 114,041, namely, 55,465 males and 58,576 females; occupying 19,647 houses, in 1 town and 190 villages. Hindus number 106,621; Muhammadans, 4614; and Christians, 2806. In 1883 the t\u00e1luk contained 1 civil and 2 criminal courts; police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), 5; regular police, 41 men.

Population (1881) 6079.\n\nSholangipuram.\u2014Town in North Arcot District, Madras Presidency.\u2014See SHOLINGHAR.\n\nShol\u00e1pur.\u2014British District in the Deccan, Bombay Presidency, lying between 17\u00b0 13' and 18\u00b0 35' N. lat., and between 74\u00b0 39' and 76\u00b0 11' E. long. Area, 4521 square miles. Population in 1881, 582,487 souls. Except B\u00e1rsi t\u00e1luk, which is surrounded by the Niz\u00e1m's territory, Shol\u00e1pur District is bounded on the north by Ahmadnagar District, on the east by the Niz\u00e1m's Dominions and Akalkot State, on the south by Bij\u00e1pur District and the Jath and Patwardh\u00e1n States, and on the west by S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, Poon\u00e1, and Ahmadnagar Districts and the States of Phaltan and Atp\u00e1di. On the west, in some places, Patwardh\u00e1n villages are included, and in others isolated Shol\u00e1pur villages lie beyond the District limits. The administrative head-quarters are at the city of SHOLAPUR.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014Except north of B\u00e1rsi, west of M\u00e1dha, southwest of M\u00e1lsiras and Karm\u00e1la, where there is a good deal of hilly ground, the District is generally flat or undulating. Most of the surface rolls in long low uplands separated by hollows, with an occasional level. The shallow-soiled uplands are suited for pasture, and the deep-soiled lowlands under careful tillage yield the richest crops. The uplands are gently rounded swellings of trap, overgrown with yellow stunted spear-grass. Shol\u00e1pur District is very bare of vegetation, and presents everywhere a bleak, treeless appearance. The chief rivers are the Bh\u00edma (Bheem\u00e1) and its tributaries, the M\u00e1n, the Nira, and the S\u00edna, all flowing towards the south-east. Besides these, there are several minor streams. Of the principal reservoirs, Ekr\u00fak and Siddheswar are near Shol\u00e1pur city, one is at Koreg\u00e1on, and one at Pandharpur. Wells also to some extent supply water for gardening and drinking purposes. The rainfall being very uncertain, a scarcity of water is\nannually felt during the hot weather. Stunted *b\u00e1buls* and mangoes, and a few *n\u00edms* (*Azadirachta indica*) and *p\u00edpals* (*Ficus religiosa*), are the only timber-trees found in the District. As these afford no cover, the District is without wild animals of the larger kinds, except the wild hog and wolf.\n\n**History.**\u2014Shol\u00e1pur is one of the Districts which formed the early home of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, and the birthplace of the dynasty. It is still a great centre of Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 population and mercantile activity. As full an account of the rise and progress of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 power as is consistent with the scope of this work will be found in the article on *India*, vol. vi. pp. 317-324, and further local details are given in the notice of the adjacent District of *Satara*. An excellent monograph has been written on Poona, S\u00e1t\u00e1ra, and Shol\u00e1pur Districts by W. W. Loch, Esq., of the Bombay Civil Service.\n\nShol\u00e1pur, in the early centuries of the Christian era (B.C. 90-A.D. 300?), probably formed part of the territories of the Shat\u00e1karni or Andhrabhritya dynasty, whose capital was Paithan on the God\u00e1vari, about 150 miles north-west of Shol\u00e1pur city. Probably also during the 900 years previous to the Muhaminadan overthrow of the Deogiri J\u00e1davs in the beginning of the 14th century, Shol\u00e1pur, like the neighbouring Districts of Bij\u00e1pur, Ahmadnagar, and Poona, was held by the Early Chalukyas from 550 to 760, by the R\u00e1shtakutas to 973, by the revived or Western Chalukyas to 1184, and by the Deogiri J\u00e1davs till the Muhammadan conquest of the Deccan about 1300.\n\nThe first Muhammadan invasion of the Deccan took place in 1294, but the power of the Deogiri J\u00e1davs was not crushed till 1318. From 1318, Mah\u00e1rashtra began to be ruled by governors appointed from Delhi, and stationed at Deogiri, which name was changed in 1338 by Muhammad Tughlak to Daulat\u00e1b\u00e1d, the 'Abode of Wealth.' In 1346 there was widespread disorder, and Delhi officers plundered and wasted the country. These cruelties led to the revolt of the Deccan nobles under the leadership of an Afgh\u00e1n soldier named Hasan Gangu. The nobles were successful, and freed the Deccan from dependence on Northern India. Hasan founded a dynasty, which, in honour of his patron, a Br\u00e1hman, he called Bahmani; and which held sway over the Deccan for nearly 150 years. In 1489, Yusaf Adil Sh\u00e1h, the Governor of Bij\u00e1pur, assumed independence, and overran all the country north of Bij\u00e1pur as far as the Bh\u00edma. For nearly 200 years, Shol\u00e1pur belonged either to the Bij\u00e1pur or to the Ahmadnagar kings as the one or the other succeeded in retaining it. In 1668, by the treaty concluded at Agra between Aurangzeb and Al\u00ed Adil Sh\u00e1h of Bij\u00e1pur, the fort of Shol\u00e1pur and territory yielding \u00a363,000 of annual revenue was ceded to the Mughals as the price of peace. The general\ndecay of the Mughal Empire from 1700 to 1750 opened the way for the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 supremacy.\n\nShol\u00e1pur formed part of the Peshw\u00e1's dominions, until the downfall of his dynasty in 1818, and the incorporation of his territories in the Bombay Presidency. It was at first included with the District of Poona, but was erected into a separate Collectorate in 1838. Since then its progress has been rapid. Roads have been constructed, and the country is now traversed by the Great Indian Peninsula Railway. From time to time its prosperity receives checks owing to drought, to which its situation and the treeless surface of the country expose it. It suffered especially in the famine of 1877, when it was the first District to manifest distress in the Bombay Presidency. Extensive relief works were at once opened, and every possible means were taken to avert the starvation of the people. Much has been done by the opening of canals and ponds, such as the Ekruk and Asht\u00ed tanks, to secure a better water-supply, and to protect the husbandmen from the cruel vicissitudes of the seasons; but the situation and physical characteristics of Shol\u00e1pur will always render it liable to the calamities arising from drought.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The Census of 1872 returned a total population of 719,375 persons. The Census taken on February 17th, 1881, disclosed a total population of 582,487 in Shol\u00e1pur, showing a decrease of 136,888, or 19\u00b702 per cent., since 1872, due entirely to mortality or emigration as the results of the famine of 1876-78.\n\nThe following are the main details shown by the Census of 1881:\n\nArea, 4521 square miles; towns, 6; villages, 706; occupied houses, 81,203; unoccupied houses, 16,679. Average density, 128\u00b784 persons per square mile; villages per square mile, 0\u00b715; houses per square mile, 21\u00b76; persons per village or town, 818; persons per house, 7\u00b717. Males numbered 294,814, and females 287,673; proportion of males, 50\u00b76 per cent. Classified according to sex and age, there were\u2014under 15 years of age, boys 111,468, and girls 104,304; total children, 215,772, or 37\u00b703 per cent.: 15 years and upwards, males 183,346, and females 183,369; total adults, 366,715, or 62\u00b797 per cent.\n\nClassified according to religion, Hindus number 530,121; Muhammadans, 43,967; Jains, 7514; Christians, 625; P\u00e1rs\u00eds, 157; Jews, 94; Sikhs, 8; Buddhist, 1. The Hindus were sub-divided into\u2014Br\u00e1hmans (priests and Government servants), 27,059; R\u00e1jputs, 2938; Cham\u00e1rs, 11,381; Darj\u00eds (tailors), 6222; Dh\u00e1ngars, 57,704; Dhobis (washer-men), 4085; N\u00e1pits (barbers), 5959; Kunb\u00eds (cultivators), 178,908; Kol\u00eds (cultivators), 7530; Kosht\u00eds, 10,658; Ling\u00e1yats (traders), 21,509; Loh\u00e1rs (blacksmiths), 2938; M\u00e1lis (gardeners), 23,898; Mangs (depressed caste), 19,233; Mh\u00e1rs, 44,001; Son\u00e1rs (goldsmiths), 5087; Tel\u00eds (oilmen), 6750; Ber\u00e1ds, 3404; Jangams, 3838; Kumbh\u00e1rs\n(potters), 3852; Sut\u00e1rs (carpenters), 4824; and Banj\u00e1r\u00e1s (carriers), 3397.\n\nThe Muhammadan population by race, as distinguished from descendants of converts, consisted of\u2014Path\u00e1ns, 4350; Sayyids, 3905; Shaikhs, 35,177; and \u2018others,\u2019 535. According to sect, the Muhammadans were returned\u2014Sunn\u00eds, 43,358; Shi\u00e1s, 391; Wah\u00e1b\u00eds, 3; and unspecified, 215. Among the Christians, 343 were Roman Catholics, 147 Protestants, and 135 of other Christian creeds. Adopting another principle of classification\u2014native Christians numbered 399; Eurasians, 68; and Europeans, 158.\n\nWith regard to occupation, the Census distributes the male population into the following six main groups:\u2014(1) Professional class, including all State, civil and military, officials, 11,314; (2) domestic servants, inn and lodging keepers, 3607; (3) commercial class, including bankers, merchants, carriers, etc., 5516; (4) agricultural and pastoral class, including gardeners, 135,064; (5) industrial class, including all manufacturers and artisans, 39,276; and (6) indefinite and non-productive class, comprising general labourers, male children, and persons of unspecified occupation, 100,037.\n\nOf the 712 towns and villages in Shol\u00e1pur District, 111 contain less than two hundred inhabitants; 243 from two to five hundred; 230 from five hundred to one thousand; 96 from one to two thousand; 16 from two to three thousand; 10 from three to five thousand; 3 from five to ten thousand; 2 from fifteen to twenty thousand; and 1 over fifty thousand. The most important towns are Shol\u00e1pur (city, 59,890; cantonment, 1391), Pandharpur (16,910), Barsi (16,126), Karkamb (6421), Karmala (5071), and Sangola (4726). All these, except Karkamb, are municipalities. Total municipal population (1881) 102,723; municipal income (1883-84), \u00a325,839; the incidence of taxation per head of population varied from 4\u00bdd. (Pandharpur) to 5s. 2\u00bdd. (Shol\u00e1pur).\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Agriculture supported (1881) 389,224 persons, or 66\u00b782 per cent. of the population; 210,292 were agricultural workers.\n\nThe soil of Shol\u00e1pur is of three kinds, k\u00e1l\u00ed or black, barad or coarse grey, and tambdi or reddish. Except in the B\u00e1rsi Sub-division, where black soil is the rule, and coarse grey is rare, most of the District is either grey or red. The black soil is almost confined to the banks of rivers and large streams.\n\nOf the total area of the District, 4521 square miles, 3413 square miles were cultivated in 1881, of which 188 square miles were revenue-free. Area assessed for revenue, 3800 square miles. Total amount of Government assessment, including local rates and cesses on land, \u00a3111,965; average incidence of assessment, including local rates and cesses, 11\u00bdd. per cultivated acre.\n\nThe total area of Government land is 2,646,136 acres, namely,\n2,400,243 acres, or 90.70 per cent., cultivable, of which 215,115 acres are alienated; 155,709 acres, or 5.88 per cent., uncultivable; 5449 acres, or 0.21 per cent., grass or kuran; 29,553 acres, or 1.12 per cent., forest; and 55,182 acres, or 2.09 per cent., village sites, roads, and river beds.\n\nIn 1883-84, 1,763,340 acres were under actual cultivation, of which 22,282 were twice cropped. Cereals and millets occupied 1,330,781 acres, of which 923,706 acres were under jodir (Sorghum vulgare); pulses, 185,528 acres; orchards, 3640 acres; drugs and narcotics, 2323 acres; condiments and spices, 7728 acres; sugar-cane, 5151 acres; oil-seeds, 189,235 acres; dyes, 468 acres; and fibres (cotton), 60,768 acres.\n\nIn 1883-84, the agricultural stock consisted of\u2014cows and bullocks, 340,258; buffaloes, 72,499; horses, 11,158; donkeys, 4191; sheep and goats, 420,616; ploughs, 21,014; and carts, 11,901. Prices of produce, per maund of 80 lbs.\u2014wheat, 5s. 5d.; rice, best, 7s. 5\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\)d.; rice, common, 6s. 10\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)d.; bajra (Pennisetum typhoideum), 3s. 5\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\)d.; jodir, 3s. 4d.; gram, 3s. 10\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\)d.; salt, 6s. 0\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)d.; flour, 6s. 7\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)d.; dal, split-peas, 4s. 3\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)d.; ghi, \u00a33, 12s. 6\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\)d. The wages of skilled labour are from 6d. to 1s. 9d. per day; and of unskilled labour, 3d. to 1s.\n\nOn garden land manure is always used, and also on dry crop land when available. The usual mode of manuring a field is by turning into it a flock of sheep and goats, for whose services their owner is paid according to the length of their stay. Scarcity of manure is the main reason why so little land is watered, compared with the area commanded by the Ekruk lake and other water-works. An industrious farmer ploughs his land several times before he sows it, and weeds it several times while the crop is growing. An irregular rotation of crops is observed, and about a fifth or sixth part of the holding is often left unsown. As a rule, the poorer landholders neither weed nor manure their land. They run a light plough over it, sow the seed broadcast, and leave it to itself. They expect to get from it at best merely a bare food-supply for the year; and while the crop is ripening, they have to supplement their field profits by the wages of labour. Much of the best land is in the hands of money-lenders who have either bought it or taken it on mortgage. The tendency seems to be for the petty landholders to diminish, and the land to fall into the hands of men of capital who employ the old holders as their tenants or labourers. It may be accepted that only about 10 per cent. of the agricultural classes are free from debt, and that the remaining 90 per cent. are involved, advances from time to time under some shape being a necessity to them. The Relief Act, by protecting their property from attachment and sale for debt, has rendered this necessity less urgent. In 1882-83, including alienated lands, the total number of holdings was 49,656, with an average area of about 48 acres.\n\nIrrigation.\u2014The irrigation works in Sholapur District are the\nKoreg\u00e1on, Ashti, and Ekruk lakes. The first-named is an old work improved, and the two last are new works. Koreg\u00e1on lake lies 13 miles north-east of B\u00e1rsi, and is formed by throwing two earthen dams across two separate valleys. The smaller of the dams was breached in 1870. It is proposed to restore it. The lake will then have a capacity of 81 millions of cubic feet. The Ashti lake lies in the M\u00e1dha Subdivision, 12 miles north-east of the town of Pandharpur. The lake when full holds 1499 millions of cubic feet of water. The Ekruk lake, the largest artificial lake in the Bombay Presidency, lies 5 miles north-east of Shol\u00e1pur. The lake is 60 feet deep when full, and holds 3350 millions of cubic feet of water.\n\nForests.\u2014The dry, shallow soil of the uplands of Shol\u00e1pur District is ill suited for trees. The present area reserved for forests is 242 square miles, or about 5.35 per cent. of the total area of the District. The forest area is much scattered. It may be roughly divided into two tracts of forest land, on the hills between B\u00e1rsi and the Niz\u00e1m's territories in the extreme north-east, and on the hills to the south of M\u00e1lsiras and S\u00e1ngola in the extreme south-west. Before December 1871, when forest conservancy was introduced, Shol\u00e1pur was extremely bare of trees and brushwood. Almost the whole land was taken for tillage. In December 1871, two square miles of scattered grass land or kuran were transferred to the Forest Department. During the twelve years ending 1883, these two miles have spread to 242 square miles. In the whole of the Shol\u00e1pur forest area, no timber-cutting rights are admitted to exist. The forest lands are of two classes\u2014scrub forest and b\u00e1bul (Acacia arabica) meadows. The scrub forest is found on the hills, and b\u00e1bul meadows occur all over the District. Of the total area, 24,885 acres consist of scrub forest, and 129,955 acres of b\u00e1bul meadows.\n\nForest receipts are comparatively small, amounting to only \u00a3829 in 1882\u201383. About one-fifth of the forest reserves are yearly leased for grazing. The remaining four-fifths are leased yearly for grass-cutting, and in these, tree plantations are formed. Besides for fuel, the timber of the b\u00e1bul and the nim (Melia Azadirachta) are used in making beams, posts, doors, carts, ploughs, and other field tools. The bark of the b\u00e1bul and of the tarvad (Cassia auriculata) is used for tanning, and the pods as well as the flowers of the pal\u00eds (Butea frondosa) are used for dyeing. The bark of the \u00e1pta (Bauhinia racemosa) is made into ropes.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014The earliest recorded famine is the great Durg\u00e1 Devi famine, which began about 1396 A.D., and is said to have lasted nearly twelve years. It arose from want of seasonable rain; and it is said to have spread over the whole country south of the Narbad\u00e1, and to have depopulated whole Districts. Next came the famine of 1460\nA.D. About 1520, a great famine is said to have been caused by military hordes destroying and plundering the crops. The famine of 1791 was very severe, especially in the Karn\u00e1tik, where the crops entirely failed. In the Deccan the yield was one-fourth to one-half the usual out-turn; but as thousands flocked from the Karn\u00e1tik to the Deccan for food, the distress became very severe. During this famine, grain sold at 3 lbs. the shilling. In 1802, the plunder and destruction of crops by Holkar and the Pind\u00e1ris caused a serious scarcity, which the failure of the rain in October and November 1803 turned into a famine of ruinous severity. In 1818, partly owing to the ravages made by the Peshw\u00e1\u2019s armies, and partly owing to the failure of crops, the District again suffered from famine, accompanied by cholera, which destroyed thousands of lives. Other famines or scarcities occurred in 1824, 1832\u201333, 1845, 1854, and 1862, owing to scanty rainfall.\n\nIn 1876, the scanty rainfall of 0'11 inches led to failure of the crops; and distress, amounting to famine, resulted over the whole District. In September and October, except one or two local showers, there was no rain; and no cold-weather crops were sown. Early in August the poorer classes began to show signs of distress; and, on the 4th September, Government sanctioned the opening of relief works. A favourable rainfall, at the opening of the rainy season of 1877, was followed by another long drought, which caused great suffering. Distress and anxiety continued till September and October, when a plentiful and timely rainfall brought down prices and gave much relief. At the close of November the demand for special Government relief ceased. A special Census taken on the 19th of May 1877, when famine pressure was general and severe, showed that of 62,712 persons employed on relief works, 3471 were manufacturers or craftsmen, 21,840 were holders or sub-holders of land, and 37,401 were labourers. The total cost of the famine was estimated at \u00a3206,502, of which \u00a3186,184 was spent on public and civil works, and \u00a320,318 on charitable relief. A considerable number of people, chiefly husbandmen, left the District and went to Berar and the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s territory. During the drought a large number of cattle died. The cultivated area fell from 2,151,617 acres in 1876\u201377 to 2,136,988 in 1878\u201379.\n\nDuring the cold season of 1879, from January to March, swarms of rats and mice appeared and ate the grain before it was ripe enough to harvest. Many fields were entirely stripped, and of others only a small portion was saved by gathering the ears while they were still green. About seven-eighths of the crops was wholly destroyed by rats. In Shol\u00e1pur, about \u00a3660 was paid as reward for rats killed, at the rate of 2s. the hundred.\n\nTrade, Communications, etc.\u2014Besides 115 miles of the south-eastern branch of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway from Poona, entering the\nDistrict at Pomalv\u00e1di in the north-east corner, and crossing in a south-easterly direction towards Gulbarga in the Niz\u00e1m's Dominions, and eight miles of the East Deccan line of the Southern Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 Railway, there are 382 miles of made roads. Of these, three are provincial and seven local fund. The three provincial lines are\u2014the Poona-Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d road, 78 miles; the B\u00e1rsi road with its extension towards the Niz\u00e1m's territory, 62 miles; and the Shol\u00e1pur-Bij\u00e1pur road, 19 miles. Of the seven local fund roads four are first-class\u2014the B\u00e1rsi-Pandharpur road, 30 miles; the Mohol-Pandharpur, 24 miles; the Pandharpur-Janoni, 42 miles; and the Jeur-K\u00e1rm\u00e1la with its extension towards Ahmadnagar and the Niz\u00e1m's territory, 27 miles: three are second-class\u2014the Shol\u00e1pur-B\u00e1rsi, 42 miles; the Shol\u00e1pur-Akalkot, 15 miles; and the Jeur-Pandharpur, 43 miles.\n\nSince the opening of the railway in that portion of the District between the Niz\u00e1m's Dominions and Poona, trade has greatly increased. Next to cotton, a large proportion of which comes from without, the chief exports are oil, oil-seeds, gh\u00ed, turmeric, and cotton cloth. The imports are salt, piece-goods, yarn, gunny-bags, and iron-ware.\n\nTrade is carried on at the towns and in markets, fairs, village shops, and also by travelling carriers. The largest centres of internal trade are Shol\u00e1pur, B\u00e1rsi, and Pandharpur, and next to these Vair\u00e1g, M\u00e1dha, Mohol, K\u00e1rm\u00e1la, Akluj, Wate-Pate, and S\u00e1ngola. Of these, Shol\u00e1pur, Mohol, and M\u00e1dha are near the railway. The number of traders is about 6000, the chief being Ling\u00e1yats, Bh\u00e1ti\u00e1s, Guj\u00e1rs, V\u00e1nis, Nagars, M\u00e1rw\u00e1ris, Br\u00e1hmans, Borahs, and Kshatr\u00edyas. Forty-two weekly markets are held in the District, at which petty traders, pedlers, and hawkers set up booths and offer for sale their goods, consisting of cotton, grain, groceries, spices, cloth, yarn, oils, earthenware, gh\u00ed, hides, fuel, etc. Of 19 trading fairs held in the District, one held at Shol\u00e1pur on the 12th January, three held in Pandharpur in April, July, and November, and one held at Son\u00e1ri in April, are the most important. The chief articles for sale are cloth, pots, grain, glass bangles, and live stock.\n\nAfter agriculture, the chief industries of the District are spinning, weaving, and dyeing. The silks and finer sorts of cotton cloth\u2014such as dhotis and women's robes\u2014prepared in Shol\u00e1pur bear a good name. Blankets are also woven in large numbers. Besides hand-loom weaving, a steam spinning and weaving mill, with 20,888 spindles and 175 looms, has lately been established at Shol\u00e1pur city. Oil-presses of the native type are worked by Tel\u00eds in many places, and saltpetre is manufactured to some extent by Mhars and M\u00e1ngs.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The revenue collected in 1882-83 from land was \u00a398,990; from stamps, \u00a36890; from excise, \u00a313,110; and by the licence-tax, \u00a33210. Forest proceeds amounted to \u00a3820; the local\nfund receipts were \u00a36970; and the five municipalities raised an income of \u00a324,615, the only peculiarity being a pilgrim-tax in Pandharpur, and a water-rate in Sholapur. The administration of the District in revenue matters is entrusted to a Collector and 4 Assistant Collectors, three of whom are covenanted civilians. The District is provided with the court of a senior Assistant Judge. For the settlement of civil disputes, there are 4 courts besides the above. Nineteen officers share the administration of criminal justice. The total strength of the regular police force for the protection of person and property consisted of 92 officers and 438 constables, giving 1 man to every 1099 of the population. The total cost was \u00a38724, equal to \u00a31, 18s. per square mile and 3\u00bdd. per head of population. There is one jail in the District.\n\nCompared with 45 schools and 516 pupils in 1865, there were, in 1877, 115 schools, with a roll-call of 4648 names, or, on an average, 1 school for every five villages. In 1882-83, there were 176 Government schools, or an average of 1 school for every four villages, with an average attendance of 5708 pupils. Besides these Government schools, there were 4 primary schools inspected by the Educational Department. In 1869, the first girls' school was opened in B\u00e1rsi. In 1882-83, the number was 4 with 176 names, and an average attendance of 105. The Census of 1881 returned 8795 boys and 204 girls as under instruction, besides 18,824 males and 214 females able to read and write but not under instruction. Four vernacular papers were published in 1884.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate, except from March to May, is healthy and agreeable. In the hot season, the mean temperature is 86\u00b0 F., very hot and oppressive in the day-time, but cool at night. Mean temperature\u2014January, 71\u00b78\u00b0 F.; February, 76\u00b78\u00b0 F.; March, 83\u00b77\u00b0 F.; April, 88\u00b0 F.; May, 88\u00b79\u00b0 F.; June, 82\u00b71\u00b0 F.; July, 78\u00b79\u00b0 F.; August, 77\u00b79\u00b0 F.; September, 77\u00b71\u00b0 F.; October, 77\u00b73\u00b0 F.; November, 73\u00b78\u00b0 F.; December, 70\u00b79\u00b0 F.: annual mean, 78\u00b79\u00b0 F. In 1883, the maximum temperature at Sholapur was 109\u00b0 F. in May; the minimum, 46\u00b72\u00b0 F. in December. The rainy season is pleasant; the sky is more or less overcast, and the rain falls in heavy showers, alternating with intervals of sunshine. The average annual rainfall for a period of 28 years ending 1881 was 28\u00b76 inches. In 1883-84, the rainfall was 39\u00b793 inches. The rainfall is generally unequally distributed, the fall in the western Sub-divisions being very scanty compared with that in the east. During the cold season, from November to February, the atmosphere, with keen easterly and northeasterly winds, is clear and bracing.\n\nBesides fever of an intermittent type, skin diseases such as guinea-worm, itch, and ringworm are prevalent in the B\u00e1rsi and K\u00e1rm\u00e1la Sub-divisions, brought on chiefly by the badness of the well water. Fever\nmakes its appearance at the end of the rainy season, being due in a great measure to the sudden change of climate. Cholera used every year to break out at Pandharpur during the periodical fairs; but improved sanitary arrangements have to some extent put a stop to this. In 1883-84, 4 dispensaries and the civil hospital at Sholapur afforded medical relief to 589 in-door and 50,037 out-door patients, and 26,000 persons were vaccinated.

Area, 847 square miles. Population (1872) 181,928; (1881) 149,539, namely, males 76,324, and females 73,215; occupying 20,261 houses, in 1 town and 146 villages. Hindus number 123,589; Muhammadans, 23,253; and 'others,' 2697. Sholapur is waving and devoid of trees, rising in places in small hillocks showing bare rock. The climate is dry; the cold season is clear and bracing. The two chief rivers are the Bh\u00edma and the S\u00edna. The Bh\u00edma forms the southern boundary for about 35 miles; and the S\u00edna runs south through the Sub-division for about 40 miles. In 1882-83, including alienated lands, the total number of holdings was 9533, with an average area of about 54 acres. In 1882-83, the area under actual cultivation was 336,182 acres, of which 7532 acres were twice cropped. Cereals and millets occupied 272,200 acres, of which 234,263 acres were under jo\u00e1r (Sorghum vulgare); pulses, 28,467 acres; oil-seeds, 30,341 acres; fibres, 8540 acres; and miscellaneous crops, 4166 acres. In 1883 the Sub-division contained (including the District head-quarters) 2 civil and 8 criminal courts; police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), 6; regular police, 280 men; village watch (chaukid\u00e1rs), 228. Land revenue, \u00a316,923.\n\nSholapur.\u2014Chief town of Sholapur District, Bombay; situated in lat. 17\u00b0 40' 18\" N., and long. 75\u00b0 56' 38\" E., on the plain of the S\u00edna, 150 miles by rail from Poona. Area, 8\u00bc square miles, or 5260 acres. Population (1881) of city, 59,890; of cantonment, 1391; total, 61,281, namely, males 31,282, and females 29,999, occupying 8330 houses. Hindus number 44,387; Muhammadans, 14,780; Jains, 1385; Christians, 511; P\u00e1rs\u00eds, 127; and 'others,' 91.\n\nThe small but strong fort in the south-west corner of the city, surrounded by a ditch, is ascribed to Hasan Gangu, the founder of the\nBahmani dynasty (1345). On the dissolution of that kingdom in 1489, Sholapur was held by Zein Kh\u00e1n. But during the minority of his son it was, in 1511, besieged and taken by Kam\u00e1l Kh\u00e1n, who annexed it, with the surrounding Districts, to the Bij\u00e1pur kingdom. In 1523, Sholapur formed part of the dowry of Ism\u00e1\u00edl Adil Sh\u00e1h\u2019s sister, given in marriage to the King of Ahmadnagar. But not being handed over to the Ahmadnagar kingdom, it formed for forty years a source of constant quarrels between the two dynasties, until it was given back to Bij\u00e1pur as the dowry of the Ahmadnagar princess Ch\u00e1nd B\u00edb\u00ed (1562). On the overthrow of the Bij\u00e1pur kingdom (1686), Sholapur fell to the Mughals, from whom it was taken by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. At the close of the war with the Peshw\u00e1 in 1818, it was stormed by General Munro.\n\nSince then, the town, no longer exposed to the raids of robbers, has been steadily increasing in importance. Its convenient situation between Poona and Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d has made it, especially since the opening of the railway in 1859, the centre for the collection and distribution of goods over a large extent of country. The chief industry of Sholapur is the manufacture of silk and cotton cloth, more than 5000 persons being engaged as hand-loom weavers, spinners, and dyers. A steam weaving and spinning mill has been established in the town. The machinery is driven by two engines each of 40 horse-power, works 20,888 spindles and 175 looms, and employs 850 hands.\n\nSholapur town is situated in the centre of a large plain 1800 feet above sea-level, on the watershed of the Adila, a feeder of the Sina. To the south-west, close to the city wall, lies the fort of Sholapur, and farther on are the officers\u2019 bungalows of the old cavalry lines, now mostly occupied by railway servants, and the railway station. To the south of the city is the Siddheswar lake, with a temple in the centre. On the south-east bank of the lake is the municipal garden; and about 1000 yards more to the south-east are the Collector\u2019s office and bungalow. About 100 to 500 yards south-west of the Collector\u2019s office stretch the officers\u2019 bungalows of the old cantonment; from 50 to 100 yards west of the officers\u2019 bungalows are the Protestant church, the Roman Catholic chapel, and the post-office. About 1000 yards south-east of the Sadr B\u00e1z\u00e1r are the Native Infantry lines, and to the south of the lines are the officers\u2019 bungalows in the present cantonment limits. The greater part of the old military cantonment of Sholapur has been transferred to the civil authorities, and is now included within municipal limits. The present cantonment covers an area of about 600 acres, just enough for a single Native Infantry regiment. Since the removal of the Native Infantry regiment in 1877, the fort has been placed in charge of the civil authorities.\n\nThe city was formerly enclosed by a wall 2\u00bd miles in circuit. About 1872, to give room to the growing town, the municipality pulled down\nthe whole of the east wall and parts on the south-west and north. The walls, where standing, are 8 to 10 feet high, 4 to 6 feet wide at the base, and 3 to 4 feet wide at the top.\n\nShol\u00e1pur fort is an irregular oblong about 230 yards by 176, enclosed by a double line of lofty battlemented and towered walls of rough stone 10 to 20 yards apart, and surrounded, except on the east or Siddheswar lake side, by a wet moat 100 to 150 feet broad and 15 to 30 deep. The whole work is Muhammadan, the outer wall dating from the 14th century, and the inner wall and four great square towers from the 16th and 17th centuries. The outer wall, with battlemented curtains and four corner and 23 side towers, is pierced for musketry; and with openings and vaulted chambers for cannon, rises 20 to 30 feet from the edge of the moat. About 20 yards behind, the inner wall, also towered and battlemented, rises 5 to 10 feet above the outer wall. The inner wall has about 25 towers, exclusive of the four square towers.\n\nBesides the courts of the Sub-divisional and District revenue officers, there are the senior assistant's and the subordinate judge's courts. The houses are mostly built of mud, but sometimes of stone and burnt bricks, and are covered with flat roofs. On account of the absence of any high ground in the neighbourhood, Shol\u00e1pur is on all sides exposed to the winds. The climate, except during the months of March, April, and May, is agreeable and healthy. The municipality, established in 1853, had an income in 1883\u201384 of \u00a315,496; incidence of taxation, 5s. 2\u00bdd. per head of population. The chief municipal undertaking has been the water-works, which form the chief source of the city water-supply. They were constructed by the municipality between 1879 and 1881, and give a daily supply of about 6 gallons a head. The water is drawn from the Ekruk lower level canal through a line of 10-inch pipes into a settling tank, and thence pumped by steam-power.\n\n**Sholavand\u00e1n.**\u2014Town in Madura taluk, Madura District, Madras Presidency; situated in lat. 10\u00b0 2' 30\" N., and long. 78\u00b0 2' E., 12 miles from Madura city, on the Vaigai river. Population (1881) 3050, inhabiting 528 houses. Hindus number 2817; Muhammadans, 163; and Christians, 70. The town was built in 1566 by a colony of Vall\u00e1lars, relatives of the Vijayanagar Governor. The fort commanded a pass on the main road from Dindigul to Madura, and was occupied by Muhammad Yusaf in 1757, to cover the operations of Calliaud against Madura. In the same year it was captured by Haidar Al\u00ed, and retaken by the British.\n\n**Sholinghar** (*Sholangipuram*).\u2014Town in North Arcot District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 13\u00b0 7' N., long. 79\u00b0 29' E. Population (1881) 5697, inhabiting 797 houses. Hindus number 5483; Muhammadans, 208; Christians, 6. Ten miles from Ban\u00e1veram station, on the southwest line of the Madras Railway. The scene of one of Coote's greatest\nvictories in 1781, when, for the third time within a few months, acting on the offensive, with vastly inferior numbers, he drove Haidar Ali\u2019s picked troops before him. There is a famous temple here, perched on a high rock, which is much frequented by pilgrims.\n\n**Shor\u00e1pur.**\u2014Formerly a tributary State of the Niz\u00e1m; situated in the south-west corner of the Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d territory, and since 1860 an integral part of the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s Dominions. Bounded on the north by Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d territory, and on the south by the Kistna, which separates it from the Ra\u00edch\u00far Do\u00e1b. Chief town, Shor\u00e1pur; lat. 16\u00b0 31\u2019 N., long. 76\u00b0 48\u2019 E.\n\nBy the treaty of 1800, the British Government engaged to enforce \u2018the just claims\u2019 of the Niz\u00e1m against Shor\u00e1pur. In 1823, the British Government, having succeeded to the rights of the Peshw\u00e1, relinquished the tribute due to it from the Shor\u00e1pur R\u00e1j\u00e1, on condition of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 abandoning certain *rus\u00fams* (revenue claims) on the neighbouring British Districts. A succession dispute in 1828 commenced a long series of disasters for Shor\u00e1pur. The State fell into hopeless arrears to its suzerain the Niz\u00e1m, and in 1841\u201342 the portion of it to the south of the Kistna was ceded to the Niz\u00e1m in commutation. A British officer, Captain Gressly, was in the same year deputed to report on the Shor\u00e1pur State. He was succeeded by Captain Meadows Taylor (1842), into whose hands the practical administration fell, as the sequel of a series of *zan\u00e1na* intrigues, domestic quarrels, and acts of extravagance by members of the R\u00e1j\u00e1\u2019s family. The improvements effected by Captain Meadows Taylor, and the era of prosperity and order which he introduced at Shor\u00e1pur, form a brilliant example of the administration of a Native State by a British officer. They are recorded with veracity in Meadows Taylor\u2019s *Story of My Life*.\n\nOn the departure of Captain Meadows Taylor in 1853, the affairs of the State began to slip back into their former condition, and the old unsatisfactory relations with the Niz\u00e1m revived. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 threw in his lot with the rebels in the Mutiny of 1857\u201358, was sentenced to deportation, and shot himself. By the British treaty of 1860, Shor\u00e1pur State was ceded to the Niz\u00e1m in full sovereignty, and has since been an integral part of the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s Dominions.\n\nThe State was founded in the 13th century by a chief of the Bedars, a race of aboriginal descent, numerous in Mysore and in the Southern Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 Country. The chiefs were styled Naiks. The Bedars were originally freebooters, but in course of time acquired considerable power. Their bands took service under the kings of Bij\u00e1pur and Golconda, and assisted the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s in the contest with Aurangzeb. They seldom commit murder, and are not petty thieves. A traditional knowledge of the customs and laws of the tribe is preserved by their bards and elders. The Bedars are fine athletic men, fond of hunting\nand open-air pursuits. Their moral code is high, and they are said never to violate their oath; but they are illiterate. [For an account of the Bedars and their customs, see Meadows Taylor's *Story of My Life*, pp. 210, 211 (second edition).]\n\n**Shorkot.**\u2014South-western tahsil of Jhang District, Punjab. Area, 1220 square miles; number of towns and villages, 174; houses, 17,197; families, 20,615. Population (1881) 95,342, namely, males 52,727, and females 42,615. Average density, 79 persons per square mile. Classified according to religion, Muhammadans number 77,616; Hindus, 17,355; Sikhs, 367; and Christians, 4. Of the 174 towns and villages, 109 contain less than five hundred inhabitants; 39 from five hundred to a thousand; and 26 from one to five thousand. Principal crops\u2014wheat, jo\u00e1r, gram, and cotton. Revenue of the tahsil, \u00a311,985. The administrative staff consists of a tahsild\u00e1r, and an honorary magistrate; number of police stations (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), 2; strength of regular police, 51 men; village watch or rural police, 102.\n\n**Shorkot.**\u2014Ancient town in Jhang District, Punjab, and headquarters of Shorkot tahsil; situated in lat. 30\u00b0 50' N., and long. 72\u00b0 6' E., among the lowlands of the Chen\u00e1b, about 4 miles from the left bank of the river, and 36 miles south-west of Jhang town. The modern town stands at the foot of a huge mound of ruins, marking the site of the ancient city, surrounded by a wall of large antique bricks, and so high as to be visible for 8 miles around. Gold coins are frequently washed out of the ruins after the rains. General Cunningham identifies Shorkot with a town of the Malli attacked and taken by Alexander, and visited by Hiuen Tsiang ten centuries later. General Cunningham infers, from the evidence of coins, that the town flourished under the Greek kings of Ariana and the Punjab, as well as under the Indo-Scythian dynasties up to 250 A.D. It was probably destroyed by the White Huns in the 6th century, and reoccupied in the 10th by the Br\u00e1hman kings of K\u00e1b\u00fal and the Punjab. The modern town is a place of little importance. Population (1881) 2283, namely, Hindus, 1167; Muhammadans, 1104; and Sikhs, 12. Number of houses, 365. Municipal income (1883\u201384), \u00a3153. The town is surrounded by fine groves of date-palms. Many of the buildings are lofty, but most of them are more or less in a state of ruin. A good b\u00e1z\u00e1r, with a gate at each end, and lined with shops built on a uniform plan; but few of the shops are tenanted. Tahs\u00edll, police station, dispensary, school, and rest-house.\n\n**Sr\u00e1van-belgola** (lit. 'Tank of the Sr\u00e1vans or Jains').\u2014Village in Hassan District, Mysore State; situated in lat. 12\u00b0 51' 10\" N., and long. 76\u00b0 31' 31\" E., between two rocky hills called Chandra-betta and Indra-betta. Population (1881) 1315. According to Jain tradition, Bhadra B\u00e1hu, one of the six immediate disciples of the founder of\ntheir religion, died here while leading a colony from Ujjain into Southern India. He is said to have been accompanied by the celebrated Emperor Chandragupta, who had abdicated the throne and adopted the life of a hermit. These events, borne out by a rock inscription of great antiquity, are assigned to the 4th century B.C. The grandson of Chandragupta is also related to have visited the spot.\n\nOn the summit of Chandra-betta stands the colossal statue of Gomatesvara, 60 feet high, surrounded by numerous buildings. The hill itself is 3250 feet above sea-level. An inscription on the foot of the statue states that it was erected by Ch\u00e1munda R\u00e1ya, whom tradition places about 60 B.C. The surrounding enclosures bear the name of Gang\u00e1 R\u00e1ya, who belongs to the Hoys\u00e1l\u00e1 Ball\u00e1la period.\n\nThe statue is nude, and stands facing the north. The face has the serene expression usually seen in Buddhist statues; the hair is curled in short spiral ringlets over the head, while the ears are long and large. The figure is treated conventionally, the shoulders being very broad, the arms hanging down the sides with the thumbs turned outwards, the waist small. The feet are placed on the figure of a lotus. Representations of ant-hills rise on either side, with figures of a creeping-plant springing from them, which twines over the thighs and arms, terminating in a tendril with bunches of fruit. These symbolize the complete spiritual abstraction of a yogi. According to the most reasonable hypothesis, the statue must have been cut out of a rock which projected above the hill; or perhaps the solid summit of the hill may have been itself cut away. The workmanship is still as sharp as if the stone had been newly quarried. Within the enclosure are 72 small statues of a similar description in compartments.\n\nOn the face of the opposite rock of Indra-betta are inscriptions cut in ancient characters a foot long. Shr\u00e1van-belgola is known to have been an ancient seat of Jain learning, and is still the residence of the chief g\u00edr\u00fa of that sect; but the establishment was deprived of many of its privileges and emoluments by Tip\u00fa Sult\u00e1n. There is a considerable manufacture of brass utensils, which are exported to distant parts.\n\n**Shr\u00edgonda.**\u2014Sub-division and town in Ahmadnagar District, Bombay Presidency.\u2014See **Sr\u00edgonda**.\n\n**Shr\u00edvardhan.**\u2014Town in Janjira State, Bombay Presidency.\u2014See **Sriwardhan**.\n\n**Shuj\u00e1b\u00e1d.**\u2014Tahs\u00edl of M\u00falt\u00e1n District, Punjab. Area, 322 square miles; number of towns and villages, 80; houses, 12,301; families, 13,653. Population (1881) 61,622, namely, males 33,394, and females 28,228. Average density, 191 per square mile. Classified according to religion, Muhammadans number 50,705; Hindus, 10,747; Sikhs, 144; Jain, 1. Of the 80 towns and villages in the tahs\u00edl, 37 contain\nless than five hundred inhabitants; 22 between five hundred and a thousand; 20 between one and five thousand; and 1 between five and ten thousand. Average area under cultivation for five years ending 1881-82, 110 square miles, or 70,580 acres; principal crops\u2014wheat, 25,839 acres; rice, 5018 acres; jowar, 4533 acres; indigo, 14,710 acres; cotton, 5880 acres; and sugar-cane, 4180 acres. Revenue of the tahsil, \u00a316,452. One tahsildar's court; strength of regular police, 59 men; village watch or rural police, 99.\n\nShuj\u00e1b\u00e1d.\u2014Town and municipality in M\u00falt\u00e1n District, Punjab, and head-quarters of Shuj\u00e1b\u00e1d tahsil; situated in lat. 29\u00b0 53' N., and long. 71\u00b0 20' E., about 5 miles from the present left bank of the Chenab. Population (1881) 6458, namely, Hindus, 3970; Muhammadans, 2476; Sikhs, 9; and 'others,' 3. The fort was built by Shuj\u00e1 Kh\u00e1n, one of the Naw\u00e1bs of M\u00falt\u00e1n under Ahmad Sh\u00e1h Dur\u00e1ni, in whose time the town possessed some importance. Municipal income (1883-84), \u00a3724, or an average of 2s. 2\u00bdd. per head. The town is chiefly built of brick, and contains some fine native houses. It is the trade centre for the richest portion of the District, and is intersected by two broad b\u00e1z\u00e1rs which cross each other. North-west of the town is the palace of Shuj\u00e1 Kh\u00e1n, a collection of rather fine brick buildings, now used as the tahsili and police station. Dispensary, school of the Church Missionary Society, sar\u00e1\u00ed or native inn, and encamping ground. The surrounding country is irrigated by the Gajj\u00fahatta and Bakht\u00fawah canals, and yields fine crops of indigo and sugar-cane. Municipal income in 1875-76, \u00a3656, or 2s. 1d. per head of population (6268) within municipal limits.\n\nSh\u00fat\u00e1r Gardan.\u2014Mountain pass in Afgh\u00e1n\u00edst\u00e1n, dividing the Kur\u00e1m and Logar valleys. An important position, commanding the road to K\u00e1b\u00fal, the possession of which, on the occasion of the retributive campaign after the massacre of Sir Louis Cavagnari in September 1879, enabled General Sir F. Roberts' force to advance on that city and occupy it almost without opposition. The ascent of the pass from the Indian side is slight, though the descent into the Logar valley is long and very steep.\n\nShwe An-daw.\u2014Pagoda in Thayet-myo District, Pegu Division, Lower Burma; situated a few miles north of Thayet-myo town. It dates from the time of Nara-pad-di-si-thu, King of Burma (about 1167 A.D.), who is noted for his piety, his communication with Ceylon, and his frequent journeys through his dominions. He is said to have received from Ceylon a sacred tooth of Gautama; and while escorting it to his capital, he was warned by portents to deposit it at the place where this pagoda now stands.\n\nShwe-Dagon.\u2014The great Pagoda of Rangoon, Lower Burma, and the most venerated object of worship in all the Indo-Chinese countries.\nLat. 16\u00b0 46' 40\" N., long. 96\u00b0 13' 50\" E. The annual festival in March is attended by pilgrims from all parts; and so great is its renown that the King of Siam, not long ago, had a handsome zayat or resting-place built near. The pagoda stands upon a mound partly natural, partly artificial, in the angle formed by the junction of the Rangoon and Pegu rivers. This mound has been cut into two terraces, the upper of which is 166 feet above the level of the ground, and 900 feet long by 685 wide. The southern approach is covered with handsomely carved wooden roofs, supported on massive teak and masonry pillars, and has at its foot two immense griffins, one on each side. From the centre of the platform rises the profusely gilt, solid brick pagoda, springing from an octagonal base, with a perimeter of 1355 feet, and a gradually diminishing spheroidal outline, to a height of 321 feet, and supporting a gilt iron network ti or umbrella in the shape of a cone, and surrounded with bells.\n\nThe space around the pagoda is left free for worshippers; but all along the edge of the platform are numerous idol-houses, facing inwards, containing images of Gautama in the usual sitting posture, and in a previous existence receiving from Dipengara, one of his predecessors, the prophetical annunciation that he too should, after the lapse of four thin-kye (a thin-kye consists of a unit followed by 140 cyphers), and the creation and destruction of 100,000 worlds, attain to Buddha-hood. Strictly speaking, the word thin-kye is a corruption of the Sanskrit asankhya, meaning innumerable. Between these idol-houses and the main edifice are several bells, and ta-gun-daing or sacred posts, each surmounted by the figure of a Karawaik (the carrying bird of Vishnu). The bells are struck by the worshippers with deer antlers, left near for that purpose. On the east side is an enormous bell, 7 feet 7\u00bd inches in diameter at the mouth, which was presented by Bo-daw Pay\u00e1.\n\nThe whole of the early history of this pagoda must be rejected as untrustworthy, but the legend concerning its erection assigns it to the year 588 B.C. The story goes that it was built by two brothers who were guided by a n\u00e1t or spirit into the presence of Gautama, who presented them each with four hairs, and bade them deposit them with certain other relics which had been left by his predecessors on a mountain in Pegu. The guardian of the earth pointed out this peak to the young men, and the sacred gifts were deposited on it under a tree. The first accounts in which any confidence can be placed are those relating to Shin-tsaw-b\u00fa, a queen who ruled early in the 16th century. The pagoda has been several times added to and re-gilt\u2014the last time in 1871, when, with the sanction of the British Government, the King of Burma sent a new ti from Mandalay, valued at \u00a362,000. The name Shwe-Dagon is derived from the Talaing word tak\u00fan, meaning 'a tree\nor log lying athwart,' which has been corrupted in Burmese into Dagon or Dagun. The Burmese word *shwe* means 'golden.' During the first Anglo-Burmese war in 1825-26, the site of the pagoda was abandoned by the Burmese on the fall of Rangoon, and occupied by British troops till the close of the war. In 1852, during the second war, the Burmese anticipated that the British would attack from the south side, which was accordingly defended. But an entrance was effected by our troops on the east, and the great Shwe-Dagon pagoda fell a second time into the hands of the British. The hill on which it stands has been strongly fortified.\n\n**Shwe-daung.**\u2014Township in Prome District, Pegu Division, Lower Burma. Lat. 18\u00b0 28' to 18\u00b0 50' N., long. 95\u00b0 10' to 95\u00b0 23' E. Bounded by Tharawadi on the south, and by the Irawadi on the west. The eastern limit is marked by the low Taung-gyi Hills, which extend from near Prome town into Tharawadi District, and are covered with *eng* trees, forming a tract called the In-daing or *eng* country. Area, 204 square miles. Population (1881) 55,140; imperial revenue, \u00a311,293, and land revenue, \u00a32555. The township comprises 16 revenue circles, each under a *thugyi*. It consists for the most part of a plain, almost entirely under rice. Tobacco and vegetables are grown along the bank of the Irawadi. In the north-east, below Shwe-daung town, palm-trees are cultivated, and from these are extracted large quantities of *tari* (toddy). In the rains, the south-west corner of the township is separated by the D\u00fcn-ka-la channel from the Irawadi, and becomes an island. About 5 miles south of Shwe-daung is the Thin-bhyu Lake, supplied by the Irawadi, and 15 feet deep in the rains. The great northern road and the Burma State Railway from Rangoon enter the township through the In-daing, striking the Irawadi at Shwe-daung, whence it proceeds northwards to Prome. This township contains the Shwe-nat-taung Pagoda, the scene of an annual religious fair.\n\n**Shwe-daung.**\u2014Chief town of the Shwe-daung township, Prome District, Pegu Division, Lower Burma; situated about 8 miles below Prome, on the left bank of the Irawadi, and on the great road from Rangoon to the north. Lat. 18\u00b0 42' N., long. 95\u00b0 17' 30'' E. Divided into two quarters by the Kula-chaung. This town is of recent growth, the old Shwe-daung or Shwe-daung Myoma, mentioned in ancient records, being now only a village some miles farther south, opposite Padaung. Population (1881) 12,373, namely Buddhists, 12,118; Muhammadans, 214; Hindus, 25; Christians and 'others,' 16. Accessible by large boats, Shwe-daung forms the port of the Paung-de and In-ma rice plains, the produce of which is largely sent to Prome. The town contains the courts and usual public buildings; also numerous pagodas, monasteries, and *zayats*, or rest-houses.\n\n**Shwe-gyin.**\u2014District in the Tenasserim Division, Lower Burma;\nlying in the valley of the Sit-taung river. Area, 5567 square miles. Population (1881) 171,144 souls. Bounded on the north by Taung-ngu District; on the east by the Paung-laung range and the Salwin Hill Tracts; on the south by Amherst District; and on the west by the Pegu Yoma Hills. After the second Anglo-Burmese war, this District included the Salwin Hill Tracts and also the Tha-tun Sub-division of Amherst District, and was first called the Martaban Province, and then Martaban District. In 1864\u201365, Martaban was joined to Amherst, and the District was called Shwe-gyin. In 1872, the Sub-division of Yunza-lin was formed into an independent jurisdiction now known as the Salwin Hill Tracts. Several small transfers have taken place since. Head-quarters at SHWE-GYIN TOWN.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014In the north, the District is highly mountainous, both the eastern and western ranges sending down numerous spurs which on the east approach to within a few miles of the Sit-taung. Both chains diminish in height towards the south, and the Pegu Yomas recede, leaving a wide stretch of fertile land. South of Kyaik-to, a town at the southern base of the Paung-laung Hills, the whole country between the Sit-taung and the Bi-lin consists of vast monotonous plains, covered with scrub forest or almost impenetrable elephant grass. At places, a pagoda, or a group of houses surrounded by a few tall palms, marks the village of some fishermen or salt-boilers, who gain a precarious livelihood from the muddy waters of the tidal creeks or the salt-impregnated soil. At high tides, the whole of the coast for miles inland is inundated; and so rapidly does the sea advance over the flats, that little or no chance is offered to the fisherman or turtle-seeker should he have neglected the warning sound of the approaching waters. During the dry season, the upper portion of these plains is easily passable by carts; but in the rains they become one vast sheet of water, with the tops of the tall elephant grass showing above, and almost concealing the pagodas, by which alone the boatman can guide his course.\n\nBoth the Pegu Yomas and the Paung-laung mountains are densely wooded, and drained by small perennial streams. The passes over the former are mere tracks winding up ravines, and along the crests of spurs. Across the Paung-laung range are three principal routes,\u2014the northern runs up the valley of the Baw-ga-ta and across the Thayet-pin-kin-dat Hill to Kaw-lu-do, the northern police-post in the Salwin Hill Tracts; the central road goes up the valleys of the Mut-ta-ma and the Mede to Pa-pun; the southern leads from the source of the Mut-ta-ma to Pa-wa-ta. The Paung-laung range, at the Sek-le hill opposite Shwe-gyin, attains a height of about 4000 feet, and terminates above Kin-ywa in Ke-la-tha, a peak crowned by a conspicuous pagoda, said to have been founded many years ago at the same time as Kyaik-ti-yo, above Sit-taung.\nThe chief rivers of Shwe-gyin District are the Sit-taung, also called the Taung-ngu and the Paung-laung; and the Bi-lin or Dun-wun. The Sit-taung rises in Upper Burma, and enters Shwe-gyin at its northern end, and, after an exceedingly tortuous course, falls into the Gulf of Martaban by a funnel-shaped mouth 7 or 8 miles wide, up which the spring-tides rush with great violence, forming a bore. This river is navigable throughout its entire length in this District by large boats and steam launches. A chopping sea follows the rolling crest of the bore, and sometimes wrecks a boat in a few minutes.\n\nThe most important affluents of the Sit-taung are\u2014the Kun, rising in the Pegu Yomas, and, after an east-south-east course of 60 miles, joins the main stream near Anan-baw; the Ye-nwe, which flows into the Sit-taung, after a south-easterly course of 90 miles, about 6 miles north of Shwe-gyin town; the Youk-thwa, navigable for a few miles above its mouth; the Mun; the Shwe-gyin; and many smaller streams.\n\nThe Bi-lin rises in the Salwin Hill Tracts, and runs a southerly course to the Gulf of Martaban. At first it is a rocky mountain torrent, but as soon as it emerges into the plains it deepens rapidly. During the rains it forms the highway between the Sit-taung and Maulmain. At spring-tides, a bore rushes up this river also, inundating the country around for miles. Its feeders are few and insignificant; but during the rains it communicates on the east with the Dun-tha-mi, and on the west with the Sit-taung and intervening rivers.\n\nShwe-gyin contains five lakes, viz. Tun-daw, Sa-win, Mwe-din, Mi-chaung-gaung, and Nga-thwe-zut. The District has never been surveyed from a geological point of view. The Paung-laung range is composed of gneissose rocks, and the whole of the level and alluvial plains are occupied by a sandy and very homogeneous deposit. Laterite formations prevail at places. The District is said to be rich in minerals. Gold occurs in most of the tributaries of the Shwe-gyin river (lit. \u2018gold-washing\u2019), but the quantity found does not repay the labour of washing. Copper, lead, tin, galena, antimony, and coal also exist, but are not worked. The chief varieties of timber are teak, pyin-gado (Xylia dolabriformis), pyin-ma (Lagerstroemia Flos-Reginae), and thit-tsi (Melanorrh\u00e6 usitata).\n\nPopulation.\u2014The Census of 1872 disclosed a population of 129,485, and that of 1881, 171,144 persons, on an area of 5567 square miles, dwelling in 1 town and 558 villages, and occupying 31,868 houses; unoccupied houses numbered 1617. Density of population, 30\u00b774 persons per square mile; villages per square mile, 0\u00b710, or one village to each 9\u00b79 square miles; houses per square mile, 6\u00b701; persons per occupied house, 5\u00b737. Total population, 171,144, namely, males 89,687, and females 81,457. Classified according to sex and age, there were\u2014under 15 years, boys 39,072, and girls 35,523; total children,\n74,595, or 43\u00b76 per cent. of the population: 15 years and upwards, males 50,615, and females 45,934; total adults, 96,549, or 56\u00b74 per cent. Classified according to religion, Hindus numbered 958; Muhammadans, 855; Christians, 1250; Buddhists, 158,149; Nat-worshippers, or persons of indigenous race whose sole religion consists in a kind of worship of spirits or 'demons,' 9932. Christians were divided into European British subjects, 14; Eurasians, 40; and native converts, 1196. Of the last-named, 1169 were Baptists. The Muhammadans were thus returned according to sect\u2014Sunnis, 673; Shi\u00e1s, 132; and 'others,' 50.\n\nClassified ethnologically, in the language table of the Census Report, Karens numbered 52,400; Burmese, 80,195; Talaings, 22,282; Taungthas, 5715; Shans, 8135; natives of India, 1780; Chinese, 280; Europeans and Eurasians, 54; 'others,' 303. The Karens are most numerous in the tract east of the Sit-taung, and belong to two great families, Sgaw and Pwo; many of them have been converted to Christianity by the American Baptist missionaries. The Talaings chiefly inhabit the plains; the Burmese, the country lying north of the Sit-taung. The Yabaings, who are engaged in the rearing of silkworms, are found mainly on the eastern slopes of the Pegu Yomas in Baw-ni. The Hindus, Muhammadans, and Chinese are all immigrants since the British occupation, as are also many of the Shans, of whom a whole colony settled some years ago at Win-ka-nin, at the junction of the Mut-ta-ma and Shwe-gyin rivers.\n\nAs regards occupation, the Census of 1881 returned the following six groups:\u2014(1) Professional, including civil and military officials, males 2086, and females 108; (2) domestic servants, inn and lodging keepers, males 80, and females 52; (3) commercial class, including bankers, merchants, carriers, etc., males 2977, and females 2449; (4) agricultural and pastoral class, including gardeners, males 30,393, and females 27,351; (5) industrial class, including all manufacturers and artisans, males 6768, and females 10,332; and (6) indefinite and non-productive class, comprising children, general labourers, and persons of unspecified occupation, males 47,383, and females 41,165. The boat population numbered 1312, namely, males 1122, and females 190, living in 290 boats.\n\nThe only place in the District with more than 5000 inhabitants is Shwe-gyin town, founded in the last century before the Burmese conquest by Alompra. It contains the usual public buildings; population (1881) 7519. Other towns are\u2014Kyaik-to, an old town at the foot of the Paung-laung range, containing a court-house, market-place, and police station; Bi-lin, with a population of 2606, founded in 1824, and containing a court-house and the usual public offices; Sittaung, on the Sit-taung river, said to have been built in 588 A.D., contains\ncourt-house, etc.; Win-ba-daw, noted for its manufacture of pottery, and as the chief halting-place for boats proceeding up the Sit-taung; Kyauk-gyi, at the foot of the Paung-laung mountains, 34 miles above Shwe-gyin, with trade in areca-nuts; Mun, Th\u00fa-yeh-tha-m\u00ed, P\u00fa-zun-nyaung, with manufacture of pottery; Nyaung-le-bin, etc. Out of the 559 towns and villages in the District in 1881, no less than 233 contained less than two hundred inhabitants, and 250 from two to five hundred; while 61 had from five hundred to one thousand, 14 more than one thousand, and only 1 above five thousand.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Agriculture supports 117,263 persons, or 68\u00b752 per cent. of the population. Of the total area of the District (5567 square miles), 174 square miles were cultivated in 1881, of which 10\u00b72 square miles were non-revenue-paying; the remainder, 163\u00b78 square miles, were assessed for revenue; the area still available for cultivation being 3581 square miles. Total amount of Government assessment, including local rates and cesses on land, \u00a315,892; average incidence of assessment, 3s. 0\u00bdd. per acre of cultivated land. Average number of acres per head of agricultural population, 0\u00b795. The most fertile portions lie along the right bank of the Sit-taung river, towards the south. The principal crop is rice, of which 25 varieties are enumerated. Areca-nuts are very largely grown on the hillsides, near running streams, the water being diverted into the palm groves by artificial channels. Cotton is sown in the taungyas or hill-clearings, where the hill tribes carry on a nomadic agriculture. Tobacco, vegetables, and oil-seeds are also produced, but the out-turn is small. Rice is the only crop of which the cultivation has steadily increased. In 1883\u201384, the area under rice was 87,908 acres; sugar-cane, 3040; vegetables, 1357; areca-nuts, 3738; mixed fruit-trees, 2284; cotton, 1; oil-seeds, 724; plantains, 885; betel-leaf, 414; tobacco, 57; cocoa-nut, 7; taungyas cultivation, 15,950; and land under miscellaneous cultivation not assessed, 649 acres; total area of cultivated land, 116,114 acres, or 181\u00b74 square miles. The area under rice in 1871\u201372 was 50,773 acres. The chief rice tracts are in the Kaw-li-ya, Kwin-da-la, Nyaung-le-bin, Ye-hla, Kyauk-gyi, and Gamun-aing circles, the last being the most important. The average size of a holding is between 3 and 4 acres. As a general rule, the land is held by small proprietors, and is very rarely rented out, and never for a long term of years. Occasionally labourers are hired for rice cultivation, and are always paid in kind.\n\nIn 1883\u201384, the average rate of rent of land suited for rice was returned at 5s. 6d. an acre; the average produce per acre being 900 lbs. Price of produce per maund of 80 lbs.\u2014rice, 6s. 6d.; cotton, 11s.; sugar, 11s.; salt, 4s. 9d.; tobacco, \u00a34, 5s. 3d.; oil-seeds, 8s.; peas, 5s. The price of a plough bullock is \u00a37; sheep and goats, each\n16s.; fish, per lb., 3d. The agricultural stock consisted of\u2014cows and bullocks, 19,410; horses and ponies, 211; sheep and goats, 1075; pigs, 5000; elephants, 161; buffaloes, 34,938; carts, 7556; ploughs, 7321; and boats, 1571.\n\nManufactures, etc.\u2014The only manufactures in the District are pots, salt, and silk-spinning. The pots are made at Pu-zun-myaung, a village a few miles above Shwe-gyin town, where clay is procured on the spot; at Kwin-dala, a little lower down; at Sheip-gyi in the Kyauk-gyi township; and at Win-ba-daw in the Sit-taung township. At Pu-zun-myaung, the pots are made for export to Rangoon and Maulmain and intermediate towns, but at the other places for local use only. The largest-sized pots are sold for 10s., and the others for 3s. per hundred. Each kiln holds 1000 pots, among which are about 200 of the largest kind. The annual produce of one man\u2019s labour is estimated at 1000 unburned pots a month, or 7000 in the season, i.e. from November to May. The industry has been in existence for about thirty years. The pots made at Win-ba-daw are solely for the salt-boilers, the pot-makers exchanging for salt, delivered at the rate of 365 lbs. for every 100 pots. The yearly out-turn averages 15,000 pots.\n\nIn the Bhaw-ni and Anan-baw circles, at the foot and on the lower slopes of the Pegu Yomas, silkworms are bred by the Yabaings as in Prome District. The annual produce of silk is about 9000 lbs., the value of which on the spot is \u00a3450. The quantity exported, chiefly to Prome and Shwe-daung, where, on account of the number of skilled weavers, there is the best market for it, is estimated at two-thirds of the total produce, or about 6000 lbs.\n\nOf made roads there are 55 miles in the District; but cart travelling is easy in the plains, and along the left bank of the Sit-taung river a fairly good road leads to Bi-lin via Sit-taung, Kyaik-to, and Kin-ywa. King Tabin Shwe-ti, who reigned over the Talaing kingdom from 1540 to 1550, made a road from Pegu to Taung-ngu with rest-houses and gardens at intervals for the use of travellers. This road still exists, but is passable in dry weather only. During the rains, communication is carried on almost everywhere by boat; the total length of waterway is 250 miles. The journey from Maulmain to the Sit-taung is made via Win-ba-daw on the west, and the Shwe-le Canal on the east, which is connected with the Bi-lin river. To facilitate intercourse with Rangoon, an artificial canal has been cut from Myit-kyo on the Sit-taung to the Ka-ya-shu creek, and thence by the Paing-kyun channel into the Pegu river.\n\nAdministration.\u2014In 1857\u201358, the total revenue of Shwe-gyin District amounted to \u00a329,200. At the end of 1865\u201366, the whole of the Martaban Sub-division was transferred to Amherst District. In 1881\u201382, the imperial income of the District was \u00a341,995, and\nlocal funds yielded \u00a35141, making altogether a gross revenue of \u00a347,136, of which the land and capitation taxes and the fisheries form the chief items. For administrative purposes the District is divided into 4 townships, viz. Sit-taung, Bi-lin, Kyauk-gyi, and Shwe-gyin. These comprise 26 revenue circles, each of which is in charge of a thugyi, under the Deputy Commissioner or his subordinates.\n\nFor some years after British annexation, the country continued in a disturbed state. Whilst Min-laung was in rebellion in Yun-za-lin, a Shan prisoner, formerly a thugyi, effected his escape, and openly proclaimed himself on the side of Min-laung. The native officer in charge was murdered in cold blood, but a small detachment was immediately sent against the rebels, who were quickly dispersed. A strong police force was then constituted, which in 1881 consisted of 356 officers and men, giving 1 man to every 16 square miles and every 480 of the population. The total cost was \u00a37505. The number of prisoners confined in the small lock-up at Shwe-gyin town was 57 in 1881. Besides the ordinary jail service, they are employed in oil and rice-cleaning mills.\n\nThe State middle-class school in 1881 had an average daily attendance of 62 pupils, all studying English. The American Baptist missionaries have also boys' and girls' schools for the Karens. But with these exceptions, the education of the people is entirely in the hands of the Buddhist monks and of a few laymen, who have opened village schools for instruction in reading and writing. The Census of 1881 returned 8743 boys and 666 girls as under instruction, besides 23,838 males and 5551 females able to read and write but not under instruction.\n\nClimate.\u2014Except in the hills, the climate is generally healthy. The heat is excessive from March till May; but a refreshing breeze blows from six to seven p.m. In 1883\u201384, the highest reading of the thermometer in the shade in May was 101\u00b0 F.; the lowest reading in December was 56\u00b0 F. Towards the end of May, the rains are ushered in by violent thunderstorms. The average annual rainfall for thirteen years ending 1881 was 144\u00bd inches. In 1883 the rainfall was 139\u00bd inches. The prevalent disease is fever. Number of patients treated at the dispensary (1883), 9881, of whom 289 were in-patients. In 1883, 4611 births and 2647 deaths were registered. [For further particulars regarding Shwe-gyin District, see the British Burma Gazetteer, compiled by authority (Government Press, Rangoon, 1879), vol. ii. pp. 643\u2013662. Also the British Burma Census Report for 1881, and the several annual Administration and Departmental Reports of the Government of Burma.]\n\nShwe-gyin.\u2014Township in the centre of Shwe-gyin District, Tenasserim Division, Lower Burma; lying on both sides of the Sit-taung\nriver. Bounded north by Taung-ngu District, east by the Paung-laung range, south by Pegu, and west by Tharawadi and Prome Districts. The eastern and western borders are mountainous, and covered with dense forest, but between the lower slopes of the hills and the Sit-taung lie fertile tracts of rice land. The other principal rivers are the Kyu and the Da-la-nun on the east, and the Shwe-gyin on the west. Most of these are navigable for some distance during the rains. In the west, the township is traversed by numerous fair-weather cart-tracks; and the Sit-taung Valley (State) Railway also runs through it. The town of Shwe-gyin lies within this township, but it is not under the charge of the Extra-Assistant Commissioner. Chief villages\u2014P\u00fa-zun-myaung, the seat of a large manufacture of earthen pots; and Nyaung-le-bin. Population (1881) 58,255; gross revenue, \u00a310,691.\n\n**Shwe-gyin.**\u2014Chief town and head-quarters of Shwe-gyin District, Tenasserim Division, Lower Burma; situated in lat. $17^\\circ 55'$ N., and long. $96^\\circ 57' 30''$ E., on the left bank of the Sit-taung river, at the confluence of the Shwe-gyin river. Population (1881) 7519, namely, Hindus, 283; Muhammadans, 427; Christians, 124; Buddhists, 6684; and 'others,' 1. Extending across the angle formed by the junction of the two rivers is a low line of laterite hills, on which stand the barracks of the small garrison, and a few houses, the remnant of the large cantonment established here after the second Anglo-Burmese war. Where these abut on the Sit-taung, north of the town, is the old fort and stockade, which the Burmese evacuated on hearing of the advance of the British column from Martaban to Taung-ngu in 1853. The main portion of the town, which is built regularly, lies in the low land between the Sit-taung and the Shwe-gyin, and during the rains is to a great extent flooded. The inhabitants are principally engaged in trade. The town contains the usual offices of a Deputy Commissioner, police station, post and telegraph offices, hospital and dispensary, school, and forest office for the examination of timber floated down the Sit-taung. Shwe-gyin is a place of modern growth.\n\n**Shwe-gyin.**\u2014River in Shwe-gyin District, Tenasserim Division, Lower Burma. It rises in the high mountains north-east of Shwe-gyin, and falls into the Sit-taung at that town. Above Shwe-gyin, where it receives the Ma-da-ma from the south, and where its channel suddenly deepens, the river is only navigable by the smallest boats. Its bed is sandy, and in places rocky.\n\n**Shwe-laung.**\u2014Township in Thun-gwa District, Pegu Division, Lower Burma; extending northwards from the sea-coast for nearly 100 miles, between the Pya-ma-law and the Irawadi rivers. Area, about 1150 square miles. In the north, the country consists of a plain covered with scrub forest; the lower portion is cut up into islands by numerous inter-communicating creeks, and is dotted with temporary\nfishing hamlets. Shwe-laung comprises 6 revenue circles. Population (1881) 46,716; gross revenue, \u00a319,203.\n\n**Shwe-laung.** \u2014 Head-quarters of Shwe-laung township, Thun-gwa District, Lower Burma, and the seat of an Extra-Assistant Commissioner; situated in lat. 16\u00b0 44' 30\" N., and long. 95\u00b0 23' 30\" E., on the Irawadi.\n\n**Shwe-le.** \u2014 River in Prome District, Pegu Division, Lower Burma; rising in the western slopes of the Ko-dek spur of the Pegu Yomas. It flows in a south-westerly direction, traversing the centre of the plain between the Yomas on the east and the Prome hills on the west, till it falls into the Myit-ma-ka, north of the village of Kin-than. This river is known by the names of Shwe-le, We-gyi, Wek-put, and Kyun-kyun-gya, in various portions of its course. During the rains, boats of 500 bushels burden can ascend the river as far as Tha-bye-paung-gyi village. The Shwe-le drains a rich teak country; and several attempts have been made to facilitate the removal of the felled logs to the Irawadi, but without success. This is owing to the numerous hill torrents that rush into the Shwe-le during the rains, and bring with them the forest debris, which during the dry season has rolled into their beds. Thus obstructions are formed; and the foaming water in a few hours bursts the banks, and either continues its course onward in the old channel, or cuts for itself a new one in the soft soil of the plain.\n\n**Shwe-le.** \u2014 Township in Prome District, Pegu Division, Lower Burma; extending along the western slopes of the Pegu Yomas from lat. 18\u00b0 28' to 18\u00b0 51' N., and from long. 95\u00b0 30' to 95\u00b0 58' E. It includes the old townships of Shwe-le, Ywa-bein, and Myo-daung, and is divided into 12 revenue circles. The whole country, except in the south-west, is hilly and covered with valuable timber. The other chief products are rice, cotton, and mulberry. The principal streams are the North and South Na-win and the Tin-gyi, but all are unnavigable within this township. Population (1881) 32,301; gross revenue, \u00a33804.\n\n**Shwe-maw-daw.** \u2014 Pagoda in the old fortified town of Pegu, Rangoon District, Lower Burma. It is a pyramidal, solid brick building, rising to a height of 324 feet from an octagonal base, each side of which is 162 feet long. It stands upon two terraces, the lower one being a parallelogram, with its sides 1390 feet long. The pagoda is surrounded by two tiers of smaller temples; the lower tier contains 75, and the upper 53.\n\nThe Shwe-maw-daw, in common with most of the sacred edifices in Burma, is connected with a legendary visit of Gautama. Tradition asserts that whilst Gautama was staying on the Mat-ku-la Hill, near the sources of the Yun-za-lin river, he was visited by the two brothers Ma-ha-tha-la and Tsu-la-tha-la of Zaung-du, a village about 20 miles above the modern town of Pegu. To them Gautama gave two hairs;\nand, foreseeing that in the 1116th year of his religion the capital of a powerful kingdom would be founded at Han-tha-wad-d\u00ed, he directed that these sacred relics should be enshrined on a hill close by Ma-ha-tha-la; and Tsu-la-tha-la obtained the aid of the Thagya king of their native town in carrying out Gautama's instructions. The King of Zaung-du placed certain n\u00e1ts or spirits to guard the shrine, made grants of money and land to the pagoda, and dedicated a number of people to its service.\n\nThe Burmese chronicle is very vague and fragmentary, until it comes to what may be called the historical period. In the year 1116 of Gautama's era (573 A.D.), Tha-ma-la and Wi-ma-la established the kingdom and city of Han-tha-wad-d\u00ed, of which Tha-ma-la was the first sovereign. Finding the Shwe-maw-daw still in existence, he added to it and dedicated 25 families to its service. Successive sovereigns kept the pagoda in repair. In 1209 A.D., A-n\u00fa-ma-ra-za, the twelfth king of the original dynasty, obtained a holy tooth from the King of Tha-tun to enshrine in this pagoda; and Dham-ma-ze-di, who came to the throne in 1502, received from the King of Ceylon a present of 100,000 paving-stones, of which 50,000 were used in paving the court or upper terrace. Towards the end of the 18th century, on the occasion of a visit from the King of Burma, the pagoda was thoroughly repaired, and the ti or umbrella canopy re-gilt. In June 1852, on the outbreak of the second Anglo-Burmese war, the Shwe-maw-daw was the scene of some sharp fighting previous to the capture of the town of Pegu by the British.\n\n**Shwe-myin-din.**\u2014Pagoda in the Ka-ma township of Thayet-myo District, Pegu Division, Lower Burma. Its name, which means 'conspicuous,' is derived from its position. It is said to date from about 100 A.D.; and subsequently, as it was found that the desires of many who visited this shrine were accomplished, it received its second name of Shwe-tsu-taung-byi, or 'prayers fulfilled.'\n\n**Shwe-nat-taung.**\u2014Pagoda in Prome District, Pegu Division, Lower Burma; about 16 miles south of Prome town. It is said to have been erected by San-da-de-w\u00ed, the queen of Dut-ta-baung, the founder of Prome (circa 442 B.C.). The building has been since added to and repaired, and being profusely gilt, stands out conspicuously on a low hill. Behind it are six other pagodas. The annual festival held in March is attended by about 20,000 people.\n\n**Shwe-nyaung-bin.**\u2014River in Bassein District, Pegu Division, Lower Burma. Falls into the Bassein river in lat. 17\u00b0 1' N., and long. 94\u00b0 55' E., and communicates with the Da-ga by several creeks. It is from 100 to 150 feet wide in its lower portion, but navigable by large boats only during the rains.\n\n**Shwe-san-daw.**\u2014Pagoda near Twan-te in Rangoon District, Pegu\nDivision, Lower Burma; more venerated by the Talaings than even the great Shwe-Dagon of Rangoon. According to its sacred history, it was erected in 577 B.C. by Thamein-taw-byin-yan, the King of Ka-bin, and his queen, as a shrine for three of Gautama's hairs given to him by three pilgrims from Ceylon, on the occasion of their visiting him whilst he was tarrying in the Zin-gyaik Hills. Subsequently, in 538 B.C., four more holy hairs were deposited in the pagoda by King Thamein-taw-byin-gnya-kan-de and a hermit named Gyi-ri-ren-ga. Near the Shwe-san-daw is a grove of *thwet-ta-bat* trees (Sapota sp.), seven in number, the only ones in Pegu. The trees were cut down, it is said, by order of the Talaing rulers, when the Burmese conquered their country, because the produce was a royal fruit to be eaten by none but the monarch, and the present trees are shoots of the old stumps.\n\n**Shwe-san-daw.**\u2014Pagoda in Prome town, Prome District, Pegu Division, Lower Burma. It is situated on a hill about half a mile from the bank of the Irawadi, and gives its name to a quarter of the town. The building is gilt all over, and is solid. Its height is 180 feet, and it occupies an area of 11,025 square feet. It is surrounded by 83 small gilt niches, called Ze-di-yan, each containing an image of Gautama. The pagoda stands on a paved platform, approached by four flights of steps, two of which, the northern and the western, are covered with elaborately carved roofs supported on massive teak posts. The gilt iron network *ti*, or conical top, is 10 feet in diameter at its base. There are on the platform 12 or 13 bells attached to massive cross-bars, which are struck with deers' antlers by those who come to worship.\n\nThis pagoda is supposed to have been first erected by two brothers, I-zi-ka and Pa-li-ka. Tradition alleges that when Gautama arrived near Prome, and was walking on the island of Zin-yan, he was accosted by a *naga* or dragon, who begged for some sacred hairs to enshrine in a temple. Gautama refused this request, saying that the glory of building a pagoda to contain his relics must be reserved for two brothers who had gone on a trading expedition to Thu-wun-na-bhu-mi or Tha-htun. The *naga* then presented to Gautama an emerald box, praying that as he could not receive the sacred hairs, he might at least contribute the receptacle for them. His gift was accepted, and shortly afterwards I-zi-ka and Pa-li-ka anchored at a place known to this day as Mya-ywa or 'Emerald Village,' and discovered the relics. Having heard of Gautama's prediction, that on the site of the modern Prome the capital of a powerful kingdom would be founded, they proceeded thither, and after considerable difficulty built the pagoda on the hill on which it now stands. Seven days after their departure for their native place, the pagoda sank into the earth. Owing to the prayers of King Dut-tabaung, the founder of ancient Prome, the pagoda reappeared, and the king restored it.\nThe Burmese records give no further account of the building, and oral tradition is all we have to rely upon. In 1753, Alaung-pay\u00e1 coated it with gold; and in 1841, King Tharawadi thoroughly repaired the pagoda, which had been damaged by an earthquake, and put on it a new ti studded with jewels. Since then it has been again partially destroyed by another earthquake. It has lately been re-gilt, at an estimated cost of about \u00a32500, raised by public subscription. The annual festival is held on the full moon of Tabaung, corresponding to March.\n\n**Shwe-thek-lut** (lit. 'Golden Life Preserved').\u2014Pagoda in Thayet-myo town, Thayet-myo District, Pegu Division, Lower Burma. It was erected by Min-gyi-swa-saw-ke, the second king of the Ava dynasty, about 1373 A.D., as a thankoffering for the preservation of his life when he, as a child, was taken captive in Thayet-myo by the King of Arakan. This building is remarkable as being one of the most southern hollow pagodas; in Upper Burma there are many of this kind, but in the lower country the great majority are of the solid bell-shaped pattern.\n\n**Shwe-tsu-taung-byi**.\u2014Pagoda in Thayet-myo District, Pegu Division, Lower Burma.\u2014See **SHWE-MYIN-DIN**.\n\n**Shwe-tsway-daw**.\u2014Pagoda in Thayet-myo District, Pegu Division, Lower Burma.\u2014See **SHWE AN-DAW**.\n\n**Si\u00e1ldah**.\u2014Village in the Twenty-four Pargan\u00e1s District, Bengal; situated just outside the limits of Calcutta. Lat. 22\u00b0 35' N., long. 88\u00b0 26' E. Terminus of the Eastern Bengal and Calcutta and South-Eastern Railways. Seat of a large transit trade.\n\n**Si\u00e1lkot** (*Sealkote*).\u2014British District in the Lieutenant-Governorship of the Punjab, lying between 31\u00b0 44' and 32\u00b0 50' N. lat., and between 74\u00b0 12' and 75\u00b0 3' E. long. Area, 1958 square miles; population (1881) 1,012,148 souls. Si\u00e1lkot forms the north-western District of the Amritsar (Umritsur) Division. It is bounded on the north-west by the river Chen\u00e1b and its tributary the T\u00e1vi, which separate it from Gujr\u00e1 District; on the north-east by the Jam\u00fa Province of Kashmir State; on the east by Gurd\u00e1spur District; on the south-east by the R\u00e1vi, which separates it from Amritsar and Gurd\u00e1spur Districts; and on the west by Gujr\u00e1nw\u00e1la and Lahore Districts. It is an oblong tract of country, occupying the submontane portion of the Rechna or R\u00e1vi-Chen\u00e1b do\u00e1b; having a length from north-west to south-east of a little over 50 miles, with an average breadth of 44 miles. Si\u00e1lkot stands twenty-fourth in order of area, and second in order of population among the thirty-two British Districts of the Punjab, and comprises 1\u00b784 per cent. of the total area, and 5\u00b739 per cent. of the total population of the Province. The administrative head-quarters are at the town of **SI\u00c1LKOT**.\n\n**Physical Aspects.**\u2014The District of Si\u00e1lkot, occupying the uppermost\nportion of the Rechna Do\u00e1b, stretches in a comparatively unbroken level from the valley of the R\u00e1vi on the south-east, to that of the Chen\u00e1b on the north-western border. Along the coast of either great boundary river, a narrow fringe of alluvial lowland marks the central depression in which they run; while above them rise the high banks which form the limits of their wider beds. Parallel to the R\u00e1vi, another stream, the Degh, which rises in the Jam\u00fa (Jummoo) Hills, traverses the south-eastern corner of the District, fringed on either side, like the greater rivers, by a strip of alluvial soil. The remainder of the surface consists of a level plain, slightly submontane in character, lying at a distance of 20 miles from the outermost range of the Himalayan system. Midway between the R\u00e1vi and the Chen\u00e1b, however, a high dorsal tract stretches from beyond the Jam\u00fa border far into the heart of the Do\u00e1b. Spreading in its northern portion from the valley of the Degh to the high bank of the Chen\u00e1b, it narrows gradually as it runs south-westward, till it finally terminates in an apex about 10 miles beyond Pasr\u00far, thus forming an irregularly triangular wedge.\n\nThe neighbourhood of the hills has imparted to the general aspect of the District a greenness and fertility rare among the Punjab plains. More than two-thirds of its area have already been brought under the plough; and of the remainder, perhaps a third more is capable of being brought under cultivation by careful tillage. The upper portion of the District, especially close to the hills, produces excellent crops; but the southern portion, farther removed from the influence of the rains, shows a marked decrease of fertility. The poorest lands lie in the triangular dorsal ridge, where the naturally arid soil depends entirely for its water-supply upon the local rainfall. Elsewhere, irrigation from wells or hill streams has turned the whole country into a waving sheet of crops. The alluvial lowlands of the Chen\u00e1b and the Degh, however, suffer in parts from the injurious saline efflorescence known as reh. Between the Degh and the R\u00e1vi, too, the wild and unproductive upland grows more and more impregnated with saltpetre as it recedes from the hills, till near the Lahore border it merges into a tangled jungle of brushwood and reeds.\n\nNumerous small torrents traverse the north-eastern tract. Several swamps (jh\u00edls) studded over the face of the country are useful for irrigation, and many of them have had their capacity considerably increased by artificial embankments, in which cases the water is made available by means of ducts. The two largest marshes are those of Satrah and Manjke. The first is artificial, and covers an area of 450 acres, supplying water to 12 villages. The Manjke marsh is 687 acres in area, with a depth in parts of 8 feet, and also irrigating 12 villages. The Daskah and Luriki marshes, formerly very large, have been recently drained. They do not now retain water, and almost the whole of their area has\nbeen brought under the plough. Some of the minor marshes are mere swamps, the beds of which are to a great extent cultivated with rice as the water dries up in the winter months. Traces of ancient canals may still be observed, some of which might repay the trouble of restoration. The most remarkable owed its origin to Ali Mard\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n, the famous engineer of Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n, and once brought the waters of the T\u00e1vi to supply the imperial gardens at Sh\u00e1hdara.\n\nThere is nothing approaching the description of a forest, or even of a good-sized wood, in the District; old trees are rare. The trees commonly found in the low-lying country are of recent growth, occurring here and there singly or in clumps around villages and wells. Much has been done of late years in planting trees along the public roads. The people also are beginning to take interest in arboriculture, and orchards and gardens are springing up all over the District.\n\nThe mineral products are few and unimportant. Beds of kankar (limestone nodules) of good quality occur in abundance along the high bank of the Chen\u00e1b, 3 miles north of Si\u00e1lkot cantonment, and at Mar\u00e1kiwal, Godhp\u00far, and Ballanw\u00e1la, the latter a mile west from the cantonment. At the same localities limestone is found; but lime of a better quality is obtained from the boulders of certain streams or from the banks of the T\u00e1vi, below Jam\u00fa. The marsh at Satrah is famous for yielding a clay called wani, which is used for pottery, and is valued for its property of receiving a colour when baked. Good pottery clays are also procured on the L\u00fand\u00e1 nall\u00e1 above Pasr\u00far. Saltpetre is found in the earth of old village sites (tibb\u00e1), but the manufacture is extremely limited.\n\nA few wolves are the only representatives of the carnivora in the District, while even deer and hares find little cover in so highly cultivated a tract. A few wild hogs and antelope are found. Wild geese, ducks, and water-fowl are abundant in the cold weather in the marshes and upon the river banks and islands. Quail abound, partridges are scarce.\n\nHistory.\u2014Ras\u00e1lu, R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Si\u00e1lkot, who lived somewhere about the first century after Christ, forms the great centre of all the local legends. General Cunningham identifies this possibly mythical hero with the son of S\u00e1livah\u00e1na, the Vikram\u00e1ditya who overthrew the Sakas about 78 A.D. Tradition universally points to the town of Si\u00e1lkot as the R\u00e1j\u00e1\u2019s capital, while a thousand stories keep alive his memory among the Hindus of the hills and the submontane tract. After Ras\u00e1lu\u2019s death, however, his kingdom fell under a curse, and remained desolate for three hundred years.\n\nAbout 643 A.D., the R\u00e1jput princes of Jam\u00fa overran the District, which they held until its union with the Muhammadan Empire. For a\nwhile the Hindu rulers managed to retain their possessions in the plains by the payment of a tribute to the Delhi Emperors; but under the Mughals, Si\u00e1lkot formed part of the Province (subah) of Lahore, and did not revert to its ancient princes until after the dissolution of the Mughal organization in the days of Ahmad Sh\u00e1h Dur\u00e1ni. During that stormy period, however, the R\u00e1jput R\u00e1jas of Jam\u00fa once more made good their claim to the fertile and level belt which stretched at the foot of their mountainous principality. In 1740, Ranj\u00edt Deo, the ruling R\u00e1j\u00e1, under a grant from the Dur\u00e1ni Emperor, possessed himself, by force of arms, of a strip of territory stretching from Dinga in the Jetch Do\u00e1b to the valley of the R\u00e1vi. A powerful Path\u00e1n family then occupied the town of Si\u00e1lkot itself; while the remainder of the District was harried by bands of Sikhs, under the command of the Bhangi chieftains and of Charrat Singh, grandfather of Ranj\u00edt Singh, the Mah\u00e1-r\u00e1j\u00e1 of the Punjab. In 1774, Brij R\u00e1j Deo, son of the Jam\u00fa R\u00e1j\u00e1, rebelled against his father, and called in the aid of Charrat Singh. The Sikh chieftain gladly embraced the opportunity; but Ranj\u00edt Deo met him on the banks of the river Basantar, as he marched on Jam\u00fa, and utterly defeated the Sikh forces, while Charrat Singh himself lost his life in the engagement. The Bhangi chieftains, who had just wrested Si\u00e1lkot town from its Path\u00e1n masters, and dreaded the rising power of their co-religionist, gave their aid to the R\u00e1j\u00e1 in this campaign. Mah\u00e1 Singh, son and successor of the defeated chief, then turned southward, and began to establish his authority in the lower part of the Do\u00e1b.\n\nMeanwhile, Ranj\u00edt Deo died in 1783, and was succeeded by his rebellious son, Brij R\u00e1j Deo, a man of debauched habits, quite unfit to hold his own against the active and vigorous Sikhs. Mah\u00e1 Singh seized upon the opportunity, and advanced upon Jam\u00fa in 1784 with a considerable force. The new R\u00e1j\u00e1 fled to the hills on his approach, and Mah\u00e1 Singh sacked the defenceless capital without striking a blow. He did not attempt, however, to secure his conquest, but retired at once to his head-quarters at Gujr\u00e1nw\u00e1la. The Bhangi chiefs of Si\u00e1lkot and the Kanhyas from the B\u00e1ri Do\u00e1b thereupon completed the overthrow of the Jam\u00fa prince, and wrested from him, by 1786, all his father\u2019s acquisitions in the plains. Brij R\u00e1j Deo himself finally fell in battle, making a last effort to resist the Sikh encroachments. The whole District thus passed into the hands of the rising sect, and the greater part became the appanage of retainers of the Bhangi confederacy or misl. The Kanhya chiefs took the rest, except a few villages which fell to Mah\u00e1 Singh.\n\nBut Ranj\u00edt Singh, son of the last-named prince, soon disturbed this amicable arrangement of territory in the Rechna Do\u00e1b. In 1790, the future Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 appropriated part of the Bhangi domains; and in 1807 he made himself master of Pasr\u00far. In the same year, the Sard\u00e1rs of\nSi\u00e1lkot ventured to question his title to these new acquisitions; whereupon Ranjit Singh promptly attacked and defeated them, adding Si\u00e1lkot to his growing dominions. By the end of 1810 the whole District had been swallowed up; while, a few years later, the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 made himself supreme from the Sutlej (Satlaj) to the Sul\u00e1im\u00e1n Mountains.\n\nBritish rule was extended to Si\u00e1lkot in 1849, after the second Sikh war. On the first distribution of the Province into Divisions and Districts, the whole upper portion of the Rechna Do\u00e1b was formed into a single charge, having its head-quarters at Waz\u00edr\u00e1b\u00e1d. In 1850, however, this extensive District underwent sub-division, being formed into the two new Districts of Gujr\u00e1nw\u00e1la and Si\u00e1lkot, while portions were made over to Gurd\u00e1spur and Lahore. Subsequent transfers of territory have brought the boundaries to their present shape.\n\nDuring the Mutiny of 1857, Si\u00e1lkot was the scene of an outbreak of the native troops stationed in the cantonments, who murdered the Brigadier commanding the station, besides other British officers, and the chaplain, with his wife and child. The mutineers laid siege to the European residents in the fort, and remained masters of the whole District for a short time. The treasury was plundered, and all the records destroyed; the prisoners in jail were released, and the houses of the residents were looted by the mutineers, aided by the bad characters from jail, and by the police and the inhabitants of the neighbouring villages. The District, however, was soon recovered. The ringleaders, including the two principal native officers of police, and the jail overseer, were summarily executed; and soon afterwards 141 of the rebellious sepoys, who had taken refuge within Kashm\u00edr territory, were handed over by the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1's officers, tried by court martial, and most of them hanged at Gurd\u00e1spur and Si\u00e1lkot.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The area at present included in Si\u00e1lkot District had a population of 805,837 at the Census of 1855. By 1868 the number had increased to 1,004,695, showing an increase of 198,858, or 24.7 per cent. At the last Census in 1881, the population of Si\u00e1lkot was returned at 1,012,148, showing a further slight increase of 7453, or less than 1 per cent., in thirteen years. Si\u00e1lkot ranks third in point of density among the Punjab Districts, being only exceeded in this respect by J\u00e1landhar and Amritsar. The slight increase is due to the fact that the emigration to other Districts in the Punjab greatly exceeds the immigration. Indeed, were it not for the large influx of fugitives from the Kashm\u00edr famine in 1878\u201380, who constitute more than three-fourths of the immigrants, the Census of 1881 would have shown an actual decrease of population, the emigration having more than counterbalanced the natural increase of births over deaths.\n\nThe results of the Census of 1881 may be summarized as follows:\u2014Area of District, 1958 square miles, with 9 towns and 2303 villages;\nnumber of houses, 143,205, namely, occupied 114,262, and unoccupied 28,943; number of families, 224,052. Total population, 1,012,148, namely, males 539,661, and females 472,487; proportion of males, 53\u00b73 per cent. Average density of population, 517 persons per square mile; towns or villages per square mile, 118; houses per square mile, 73; persons per village, 438; persons per house, 8\u00b78. Classified according to sex and age, there were in 1881\u2014below 15 years, males 217,883, and females 186,633; total children, 404,516, or 40 per cent. of the whole population: 15 years and upwards, males 321,778, and females 285,854; total, 607,632, or 60 per cent. of the whole population.\n\nReligion.\u2014As regards religious distinctions, the Muhammadans form the great bulk of the population, and in 1881 numbered 669,712, or 66\u00b716 per cent. of the total. Hindus numbered 299,311, or 29\u00b757 per cent.; Sikhs, 40,195, or 4 per cent.; Jains, 1,388; Christians, 1,535; and P\u00e1rs\u00eds, 7. The principal Muhammadan tribes include\u2014Sayyids, 12,849; Shaikhs, 11,636; Path\u00e1ns, 4,118; Mughals, 4,537; Kashmir\u00eds, 19,153; and Khojahs, 5,550. These are the Muhammadans by race descent, as apart from the descendants of converts from Hindu castes. The J\u00e1ts, the most numerous tribe in the District, who form the great bulk of the agricultural class, number 266,040, of whom 170,878 are Muhammadans, 95,147 Hindus and Sikhs, and 15 of other religions. The R\u00e1jputs number 57,269, consisting of 45,534 Muhammadans and 11,735 Hindus and Sikhs. The Aw\u00e1ns, the leading race of the submontane tract, are a tribe of great social and political importance, 19,753 in number, and exclusively Muhammadans. Arains, 65,241, and G\u00faj\u00e1rs, 11,642, are almost exclusively Muhammadans. Of the Chuhrs, 78,980 in number, 19,617 are Hindus and Sikhs; Tarkh\u00e1ns, 41,781, include 9,290 Hindus or Sikhs; and Kumbh\u00e1rs, 29,713, include 10,304 Hindus and Sikhs. The following are the other principal classes met with in the District, mainly Muhammadans, but nearly all of them with a greater or lesser Hindu and Sikh element\u2014Jhinw\u00e1rs, 35,314; Megs, 28,705; N\u00e1is, 20,569; Loh\u00e1rs, 18,584; Barw\u00e1las, 16,901; Moch\u00eds, 15,003; Dhob\u00eds, 13,988; Tel\u00eds, 13,652; Batw\u00e1ls, 13,190; Mir\u00e1s\u00eds, 12,921; Son\u00e1rs, 8,947 (chiefly Hindus); Cham\u00e1rs, 8,076; Changars, 7,139; Lab\u00e1ns, 6,584; Fak\u00edrs, 6,156; and Bhati\u00e1s, 5,784. The purely Hindu castes are\u2014Br\u00e1hmans, 36,100; Khattr\u00eds, 18,440; Aroras, 15,793; and Baniy\u00e1s, 10,795.\n\nThe Christian population consists of\u2014Europeans, 1,264; Eurasians, 18; and Natives, 253: thus classified according to sect\u2014Church of England, 923; Roman Catholic, 300; Church of Scotland, 144; Protestants, undistinguished by sect, 64; American Church, 20; Methodists, 13; unspecified and others, 71. The American Presbyterian Mission have had a station at Sialkot since 1855, and the Church\nof Scotland since 1857. The Rev. T. Hunter, the first Scotch missionary, was murdered, together with his wife and child, by the mutineers a few months after the establishment of the Mission, and a handsome church has been erected at Si\u00e1lkot in his memory.\n\n**Urban and Rural Population.** \u2014 The District contains three towns with upwards of five thousand inhabitants, namely, Sialkot Town (1881), 45,762; Pasrur, 8378; and Daskah, 5525. Six other towns, with less than five thousand inhabitants, are also municipalities, namely, Zafarwal, 4978; Narowal, 4558; Kila Sobha Singh, 4521; Jamki, 4157; Mitranwali, 3730; and Sankhatra, 2381. The total urban population thus disclosed amounts to 83,990, or 8.3 per cent. of the District population, leaving 928,158, or 91.7 per cent., for the rural population. The total municipal income of the nine towns above mentioned amounted in 1883-84 to \u00a36981, or an average of 1s. 7\u00bdd. per head of the municipal population. Of the 2312 towns and villages in the District, 806 contain less than two hundred inhabitants; 957 between two and five hundred; 373 between five hundred and a thousand; 142 between one and two thousand; 19 between two and three thousand; 12 between three and five thousand; 2 between five and ten thousand; and 1 between twenty and fifty thousand inhabitants.\n\nAs regards occupation, the Census of 1881 returned the adult male population under the following seven classes:\u2014(1) Professional class, including all Government servants, civil and military, 16,692; (2) domestic and menial class, 24,318; (3) commercial class, including merchants, traders, carriers, etc., 5730; (4) agricultural and pastoral class, including gardeners, 152,932; (5) industrial and manufacturing class, 83,916; (6) indefinite and non-productive class, including labourers, 23,921; and (7) unspecified, 14,269.\n\nThe houses are built either of mud or of baked brick. An ordinary village is a mere collection of flat-roofed mud huts separated by narrow alleys, plastered over with a mixture of earth, chopped straw, and cow-dung; surrounded outside by rows of cow-dung (used for fuel), stacks of straw, sheds for weavers, goat pens, places for meeting, and temples for worship, huddled together in disorderly array; while every yard of available space is filled up with heaps of village refuse required for manure. Only in the larger and wealthier villages may be seen a few brick houses. Each family lives in a separate courtyard; but here all pretence of privacy is at an end. Cattle and their owners consort together, and may even be seen herding in the same apartment, while a total disregard of order or cleanliness prevails. Where there are two or three different castes in the same village, they are usually grouped into separate quarters.\n\nExcept among the upper classes, there does not seem to be much fondness for dress. A languti of white or blue cloth round the loins, a\nscarf over the shoulder, a turban (pagri) of limited dimensions, and a pair of shoes, compose the clothing of the great majority of the people, except on high days and holidays. The Rajputs are very partial to ear-rings, and to English chintzes for jackets. In tracts where thorny brushwood abounds, yellow leather trousers are worn. The Hindu Jats sometimes wear short baggy trousers. Women are given to wearing coarse jewellery and nose-rings; and a small looking-glass, attached to a ring on the finger, is part of the adornment. Nearly all the cloth is made in the village by a race of weavers maintained for the purpose; the spinning, the early manipulation, and subsequent ornamentation being the work of the females of the family.\n\nThe food of the people consists chiefly of grain and vegetables; meat is a luxury which few can afford, except on days of rejoicings, when a sheep or goat is killed and distributed. Fish is seldom eaten, even by those residing near rivers. During the spring, barley, kangni, sawank, and bajra form the staples of diet; during the autumn and winter, wheat and rice. The grain, done up into a dry cake and baked, is eaten with lime or mango pickle, or with clarified butter and salt, or with a few chillies or onions and salt. To make it more palatable, a wash of vetches or country pea, called salina, is sometimes added. The favourite drink is lassi, or buttermilk. Intoxicating liquors are not much drunk, though some Jats have a habit of taking a decoction of poppies. Two meals are ordinarily taken in the day, morning and evening; but day-labourers engaged in hard manual labour indulge in a mid-day meal, when able to afford it.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Out of a total area of 1958\u00bd square miles, or 1,253,559 acres, as much as 902,996 acres were under cultivation in 1883-84. Of the remainder, 22,815 acres were returned as grazing lands, 124,119 acres as cultivable, and 203,629 acres as uncultivable waste. The area under each crop in 1883-84 (including lands bearing two harvests in the year) was as follows:\u2014Rabi or spring harvest, 600,959 acres, namely, wheat, 374,501 acres; barley, 101,000; gram, 18,281; pulses, 35,685; tobacco, 6066; oil-seeds, 13,496; spices and drugs, 1060; vegetables, 5144; and other crops, 45,726 acres. Kharif or autumn harvest, 330,179 acres, namely, rice, 67,915 acres; Indian corn, 61,880; millets, 63,051; pulses, 21,375; oil-seeds, 11,465; sugar-cane, 48,644; cotton, 38,374; vegetables, 3120; and other crops, 14,355 acres. Wheat forms the great staple of the rabi, and rice and millets of the kharif. The best sugar-cane grows on the land watered by the Degh, and in the lowlands of the Chenab north of Sialkot town. Millets, on the other hand, occupy the dry uplands in the centre of the District. Irrigation is widely practised, as much as 559,731 acres (or nearly two-thirds of the total cultivated area) being artificially supplied with water, according to the latest returns. In the tract known as the\nBajw\u00e1t, nearly every field derives an abundant supply from a network of cuts and watercourses in connection with the Chen\u00e1b and its branches. Elsewhere, irrigation is carried on from wells, or by means of Persian wheels working upon the banks of streams. The value of manure is universally appreciated, and rotation of crops is carried out to a considerable extent.\n\nThe agricultural stock of the District in 1883\u201384 was returned as follows:\u2014Cows and bullocks, 233,556; horses, 3252; ponies, 1231; donkeys, 6114; sheep and goats, 44,792; pigs, 521; camels, 98; ploughs, 98,395. The indigenous supply of cattle is insufficient to meet the local demand, and large numbers are bought at the cattle fairs in Amritsar, or are imported from other Districts. An annual cattle fair is held at Si\u00e1lkot in September, lasting for a week, at which from 8000 to 10,000 head of cattle, chiefly buffaloes, are exhibited. The attendance is estimated at about 70,000, and in 1883 the value of the cattle sold amounted to \u00a315,000.\n\nThe village tenures belong as a rule to the intermediate type known as pattid\u00e1ri. Rents are paid almost equally in kind and in money. Where money rents prevail, the following are the minimum and maximum rates, varying according to the quality of the land, and the caste or social status of the tenant:\u2014Rice lands, from 10s. to \u00a32, 18s. an acre; wheat (irrigated), from 5s. 4d. to \u00a32 an acre; wheat (unirrigated), from 3s. 2d. to \u00a31, 5s. 1od. an acre; cotton, from 3s. to \u00a31, 5s. an acre; sugar-cane, from 5s. to \u00a33, 8s. 6d. an acre; and tobacco, from 9s. 4d. to \u00a34, 10s. an acre. Day-labourers are seldom employed upon agricultural work except at harvest-time, when they receive their wages in grain. Skilled labourers in towns now receive from 8d. to 10d. per diem; unskilled, from 3d. to 4\u00bdd. per diem. Prices of food-grains ruled as follows on the 1st of January 1884:\u2014Wheat, 24 sers per rupee, or 4s. 8d. per cwt.; barley, 39 sers per rupee, or 2s. 11d. per cwt.; gram and b\u00e1jra, 33\u00bd sers per rupee, or 3s. 4\u00bdd. per cwt.; Indian corn, 32 sers per rupee, or 3s. 6d. per cwt.; jo\u00e1r, 36 sers per rupee, or 3s. 1d. per cwt.; rice, 13 sers per rupee, or 8s. 7d. per cwt.\n\nCommerce and Trade, etc.\u2014The local commerce centres in the town of Si\u00e1lkot, which gathers into its b\u00e1z\u00e1rs more than half the raw produce of the District. The large markets of Lahore and Amritsar (Umritsur) afford a ready outlet for its surplus stocks, while the great rivers on either side form natural channels of communication with the lower parts of the Punjab. Grain of all kinds is exported to M\u00falt\u00e1n, Lahore, and Amritsar; sugar and molasses to Pesh\u00e1war, K\u00e1b\u00fal, and Kar\u00e1ch\u00ed (Kurrachee). The famous koftg\u00e1ri or damascene work manufactured at Kotli, a large village six miles from Si\u00e1lkot, is carried for sale by the artisans themselves to all parts of India. Shawl-edging, manufactured by Kashmiri settlers at Si\u00e1lkot\nand Kil\u00e1 Sobha Singh, is sent to Amritsar; and country cloth to the hill tracts. The import trade includes\u2014grain from Bat\u00e1l\u00e1 and the B\u00e1ri Do\u00e1b uplands; salt from Pind D\u00e1dan Kh\u00e1n; rice, tobacco, and potatoes from K\u00e1ngra, N\u00farpur, Murree, and Dalhousie; gh\u00ed from Jal\u00e1lpur and the hills; timber, spices, hides, fruits, valuable shawls, and woollen fabrics from Kashm\u00edr; hemp from the submontane tracts of Jam\u00fa; and indigo from M\u00falt\u00e1n.\n\nThe indigenous manufactures of the District comprise silk, saddlery, shawl-edging, coarse chintzes, pottery, brass vessels, country cloth, cutlery, koftg\u00e1ri ware, and paper. In 1869, an undertaking was started at Si\u00e1lkot under the name of the Belfast Flax Company, to encourage the growth of flax for exportation to England; but though an excellent fibre was raised in the District, the difficulty of procuring good seed, and the apathy of the peasantry (who would not adopt the new methods necessary to the production of first-class flax), caused the enterprise to prove a failure after some years' trial.\n\nMeans of Communication.\u2014The metalled road from Waz\u00edr\u00e1b\u00e1d to Si\u00e1lkot, and thence on to Jam\u00fa in Kashm\u00edr territory, was the principal line of communication in the District before the railway was opened. It has a length of about 35 miles in the District. Other lines communicate with Gujr\u00e1nw\u00e1la, Amritsar, Lahore, via Emin\u00e1b\u00e1d, Gurd\u00e1sipur, and Dalhousie. Total length of District roads (1883\u201384), metalled 43 miles, and unmetalled 747 miles. A branch of the Punjab Northern State Railway from Waz\u00edr\u00e1b\u00e1d to Si\u00e1lkot, a distance of 27 miles, was opened for traffic on the 1st January 1884. The Chen\u00e1b and R\u00e1vi rivers are navigable by ordinary flat-bottomed boats of from 250 to 400 maunds burden, according to the season of the year. Ferries are established at all the principal crossings.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The District staff usually comprises a Deputy Commissioner, a Judicial Assistant, an Assistant Commissioner, and 3 Extra-Assistant Commissioners, besides a Cantonment Magistrate, the ordinary medical, fiscal, and constabulary officials. The total imperial revenue raised in the District in 1872\u201373 amounted to \u00a3125,768; of which sum \u00a3108,598, or more than five-sixths, was derived from the land. By 1883\u201384, the total imperial revenue had increased to \u00a3145,531, of which \u00a3111,712 was derived from the land. Besides these imperial receipts, a small provincial and local revenue is also raised. The total number of civil and revenue judges in 1883\u201384 was 21; and the total number of magistrates, 20. The regular police force in the same year numbered 377 officers and men, while the cantonment and the municipalities maintained a separate constabulary of 178 men. This force is supplemented by a body of 2525 village watchmen (chaukid\u00e1rs). The total machinery, therefore, for the protection of person and property amounted to 3080 officers and men,\nbeing 1 policeman to every 0\u00b76 square miles of the area and to every 328 of the population. The jail at Si\u00e1lkot contained in 1883 a total of 1428 prisoners, with a daily average of 345.\n\nEducation has made a considerable start since the introduction of British rule. In 1872-73, the District contained 427 schools of all grades (besides the normal school at Si\u00e1lkot town), with a roll of 8491 pupils. The total expenditure on education during that year amounted to \u00a33275. In 1883-84, the Government schools in Si\u00e1lkot District consisted of a high school, 9 middle schools, 72 primary boys' schools, and 38 primary girls' schools, attended by a total of 5416 pupils, of whom 880 are girls. The above are exclusive of 4 missionary or church schools, a convent school for Europeans and Eurasians, a municipal school, and a school for vernacular teachers. It also excludes indigenous uninspected village schools, which were returned at 604 in 1882-83, with 6831 pupils. The Census Report of 1881 returned 9525 boys and 455 girls as under instruction, besides 19,988 males and 408 females able to read and write but not under instruction.\n\nThe District contains four printing presses,\u2014one at the jail, and another at Hajipur belonging to the American Mission, which print in English, Urdu, Persian, and Hindi; and two native presses in Si\u00e1lkot town, which print in the vernacular only. One of these publishes a vernacular newspaper, the Rafa-i-Am, which has a fair circulation.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate of Si\u00e1lkot may be considered as free from excessive heat, judged by the ordinary standard of the Punjab. Even in the hottest weather, a storm in the hills produces a pleasing change; while in May and September, cool breezes from the Him\u00e1layas moderate the prevailing heat. The mean monthly temperature for a period of fifteen years ending 1881 is returned as follows:\u2014January, 51\u00b75\u00b0 F.; February, 56\u00b75\u00b0; March, 65\u00b73\u00b0; April, 76\u00b77\u00b0; May, 84\u00b79\u00b0; June, 90\u00b75\u00b0; July, 63\u00b78\u00b0; August, 84\u00b79\u00b0; September, 83\u00b71\u00b0; October, 74\u00b75\u00b0; November, 61\u00b78\u00b0; and December, 52\u00b77\u00b0. Average annual mean, 72\u00b74\u00b0 F.\n\nIn 1883, the thermometer in May ranged from a maximum of 113\u00b78\u00b0 to a minimum of 64\u00b72\u00b0, with a mean of 89\u00b76\u00b0; in July 1883, the maximum was 114\u00b79\u00b0, minimum 68\u00b75\u00b0, mean 91\u00b73\u00b0; in December 1883, the maximum was 73\u00b71\u00b0, minimum 34\u00b71\u00b0, mean 54\u00b77\u00b0. The average annual rainfall for twenty-four years ending 1881 was 37\u00b783 inches, distributed as follows:\u2014January to May, 7\u00b794 inches; May to September, 27\u00b783 inches; October to December, 2\u00b706 inches. In 1883, the total rainfall amounted to 28\u00b79 inches, or 8\u00b79 inches below the average.\n\nSi\u00e1lkot bears a good reputation as a healthy tract. Malarial fever, small-pox, dysentery, and pneumonia are the prevalent diseases. The itch also proves troublesome amongst the agricultural classes. The\ntotal number of deaths from all causes reported in 1883 was 28,686, or 28 per thousand. Of these no less than 16,021, or 15.8 per thousand, were assigned to fevers. The District contains 11 Government charitable dispensaries, which afforded relief in 1883 to 78,754 persons, of whom 987 were in-patients. The leper asylum at Path\u00e1nw\u00e1li consists of three barracks, capable of accommodating about 100 lepers. Cattle disease occurs in the form of a murrain called waba, which carries off a large number of beasts every year.

Also Report on the Revised Settlement of Si\u00e1lkot District, 1850-1860, by E. A. Prinsep, Esq.; the Punjab Census Report for 1881; and the several annual Administration and Departmental Reports of the Punjab Government.]\n\nSi\u00e1lkot.\u2014Tahsil of Si\u00e1lkot District, Punjab; consisting of a fertile agricultural country, lying round the town of Si\u00e1lkot. Area, 637 square miles; number of towns and villages, 794; houses, 44,195; families, 83,106. Population (1881) 402,825, namely, males 215,094, and females 187,731. Average density of population, 632 persons per square mile. Classified according to religion, Muhammadans number 257,341; Hindus, 129,039; Sikhs, 14,182; Jains, 876; Christians, 1380; and P\u00e1rsis, 7. Of the 794 towns and villages in the tahsil, 595 contain less than five hundred inhabitants; 122 between five hundred and a thousand; 75 between one thousand and five thousand; 1 between five and ten thousand; and 1 between twenty and fifty thousand. The average area under cultivation for five years ending 1881-82 is returned at 290,658 acres; the principal crops being\u2014wheat, 96,518 acres; barley, 60,752 acres; rice, 19,208 acres; Indian corn, 23,170 acres; jo\u00e1r, 16,111 acres; gram, 5361 acres; other food-grains, 4050 acres; cotton, 17,882 acres; sugar-cane, 15,848 acres; vegetables, 3820 acres; tobacco, 1851 acres; and poppy, 142 acres. Revenue of the tahsil, \u00a325,989. The administrative staff, including the head-quarters officers of the District, consists of a Deputy Commissioner, Judicial Assistant Commissioner, 3 Assistant or Extra-Assistant Commissioners, 1 Judge of Small Cause Court, 1 tahsild\u00e1r, and 2 muns\u00edfs. These officers preside over 9 civil and 7 criminal courts; number of police circles, 4; strength of regular police, 131 men; village watch or rural police (chaukid\u00e1rs), 525.\n\nSi\u00e1lkot.\u2014Town, municipality, military cantonment, and administrative head-quarters of Si\u00e1lkot District, Punjab; situated in lat. 32\u00b0 31' N., and long. 74\u00b0 36' E., on the northern bank of the Aik torrent, upon the edge of the high triangular ridge which extends southward from the Jam\u00fa Hills. Distant from Lahore 72 miles north-east.\n\nThe town was founded, according to tradition, by R\u00e1j\u00e1 S\u00e1l or\nSh\u00e1l, mentioned in the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata as an uncle of the P\u00e1ndava princes. Restored about 65 or 70 A.D. by S\u00e1lwan or S\u00e1livah\u00e1na, otherwise called Vikram\u00e1ditya, father of the great Punjab hero, Ras\u00e1lu, whose capital Si\u00e1lkot is also stated to have been, and whose exploits form the subject of countless Punjab legends. Towards the end of his reign, Ras\u00e1lu became involved in wars with a R\u00e1j\u00e1 H\u00fadi, popularly stated to have been a Ghakkar chieftain. Being worsted in battle, Ras\u00e1lu as the price of peace was forced to give his daughter in marriage to his conqueror, who, on Ras\u00e1lu\u2019s death without heirs, is said to have succeeded to the rule of Si\u00e1lkot. According to a further legend related to Mr. Prinsep\u2014\u2018After the death of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Ras\u00e1lu, the country is said to have fallen under the curse of P\u00faran (brother of Ras\u00e1lu, who had become a fak\u00edr) for 300 years, lying totally devastated from famine and incessant plunder.\u2019 The country was afterwards occupied in the 7th century A.D. by the R\u00e1jput princes of Jam\u00fa; and under the Mughal Emperors, Si\u00e1lkot became the head-quarters of a fiscal district (sark\u00e1r). In the centre of the town stand the remains of an ancient fort, popularly believed to have been the original stronghold of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Salw\u00e1n, although recent excavations show that it has not in all probability existed more than 1000 years. Other similar mounds stand among the outskirts of the town. In modern days, the old fort is of historical interest for its gallant defence by the few European residents who took refuge here during the Mutiny of 1857. It is now dismantled, and the few buildings it contains are used for public purposes.\n\nThe population of Si\u00e1lkot town was returned in 1881 at 33,850, and that of the cantonment at 11,912. Total population of town and cantonment, 45,762, namely, males 25,767, and females 19,995. Classified according to religion, Muhammadans numbered 28,865; Hindus, 12,751; Sikhs, 1942; Jains, 876; Christians, 1321; and P\u00e1rsis, 7. Municipal income (1883-84), \u00a35052, derived almost entirely from octroi duties.\n\nThe town is very extensive, and is steadily increasing in size and commercial importance, especially since the opening of the railway connecting it with the main line of the Punjab Northern State Railway at Waz\u00edr\u00e1b\u00e1d. It is fairly handsome, well built, and clean. Its main streets are wide and open, and either paved or metalled, with good drainage on both sides. The principal are the Kanak mandi, or grain market, running north and south; and the bara b\u00e1z\u00e1r, containing the shops of all the principal dealers in cloth, jewellery, fruits, etc. The principal buildings, shrines, etc., within the town include the following:\u2014The ruined and dismantled fort alluded to above. A temple erected by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Tej Singh has a conspicuous spire, visible from all parts of the town. The shrine of the first Sikh g\u00far\u00ed, B\u00e1ba\nN\u00e1nak (see Amritsar District), is the scene of a famous annual fair, largely attended by Sikhs from all parts of the District. The Darb\u00e1r B\u00e1oli S\u00e1hib, a covered well, erected by a R\u00e1jput disciple of B\u00e1ba N\u00e1nak, also ranks high in religious consideration among the Sikhs. A Muhammadan shrine of Im\u00e1m Al\u00ed-ul-hak is a handsome building of ancient construction. The public and municipal buildings include the tahsil, police station, dispensary, town hall, post-office, mission school, and four female schools, two sar\u00e1\u00eds or native inns, rest-house for village notables and head-men visiting the city, and poorhouse, where cooked food is daily distributed. The roads from Amritsar, Lahore, Gurd\u00e1spur, and Gujr\u00e1nw\u00e1la converge on the Aik stream, which is crossed by an ancient but well-built and substantial bridge. The railway station is situated just outside the town on the north.\n\nThe civil station is situated about half a mile north-east of the town, and contains, besides the dwellings of the civil residents, the District court-house, treasury, jail, and police lines. The cantonment lies about a mile north of the town, being built on an elevated ridge of land affording good natural drainage. The cantonment is exceedingly well laid out, and occupies an area of 5 miles in length east and west, by 3 miles north and south. Most of the roads are lined with trees. The principal public buildings in the cantonment are the post-office, telegraph office, two churches, a Roman Catholic chapel, and the general military prison for the Punjab. There are recreation grounds, racquet courts, and a well-kept public garden 27 acres in extent, provided with tennis-courts, station library, and reading-room.\n\nAs a local trade centre, Si\u00e1lkot is fast rising in importance. It has several wealthy bankers and merchants, of whom the most prominent belong to the Jain tribe of Bh\u00e1br\u00e1s. The distinctive industry of the place is the manufacture of paper, carried on in three hamlets forming suburbs to the city. The manufacture is said to have been introduced four centuries ago; and under the Mughal Emperors Si\u00e1lkot paper was noted for its excellence, being largely used at the Delhi court. In those days, the yearly value is said to have amounted to \u00a380,000; but under the Sikhs it declined rapidly until only twenty mills remained, turning out paper to the value of \u00a32500 a year. At the time of the Settlement of the District (1850\u20131860) there were 82 mills at work, with an annual out-turn valued at \u00a37500. At the present time the manufacture is again on the decline, owing to the exclusive use by Government of prison-made paper. A description of cloth known as susi is also manufactured to a considerable extent; and, next to paper, it forms the principal export. The imports are grain, salt, European piece-goods, metals, and raw sugar.\n\nSi\u00e1ltek. \u2014 Village in Cachar District, Assam; situated on the Bar\u00e1k river, near the boundary of Sylhet, where toll is levied on the\ntimber, bamboos, etc. floated down stream. Up to 1876, the river tolls at Si\u00e1ltek gh\u00e1t were farmed out to a contractor, who paid rent at the rate of \u00a31500 a year. Since that date the toll station has been taken under direct Government management, and the receipts have rapidly declined. In 1876\u201377 they fell to \u00a3854, and in 1881\u201382 to \u00a3332. One of the largest b\u00e1z\u00e1srs in Cachar is held at Si\u00e1ltek.\n\nSi\u00e1na.\u2014Town in Bulandshahr District, North-Western Provinces.\u2014See SIYANA.\n\nSi\u00e1rsol.\u2014Coal-mine in Bardw\u00e1n District, Bengal, being a part of the Raniganj coal-field. The mineral is a variety of non-coking bituminous coal, with a large portion of volatile matter and ash. The brighter portions consist of very pure coal, a sample of which gave the following results:\u2014Volatile matter, 40 per cent.; fixed carbon, 57\u00b75 per cent.; ash, 2\u00b75 per cent. The composition varies, however, considerably, that of one sample being:\u2014fixed carbon, 51\u00b71 per cent.; volatile matter, 38\u00b75; and ash, 10\u00b74; while selected rich layers gave the following analysis:\u2014fixed carbon, 57\u00b725 per cent.; volatile matter, 41 per cent.; and ash, only 1\u00b775 per cent. The output of coal from the Si\u00e1rsol mine, which is the property of a private company, amounted in 1883 to 39,911 tons, against an average of 34,460 tons in the three previous years. The mine gives employment to upwards of 500 men, women, and children.\n\nSibi.\u2014District of Southern Afghanistan, ceded to the British by the terms of the treaty of Gandamak in 1881. It lies between 29\u00b0 20' and 29\u00b0 45' N. lat., and 67\u00b0 45' and 68\u00b0 15' E. long. It is the most northerly portion of the Kachi plain, from the remainder of which it is separated by a low stony ridge, broken in two places by wide gaps, through one of which the Nari river passes, and through the other the Thali torrent. Beyond this ridge lies the Mal district, which is politically connected with Sibi, though physically indistinguishable from the country under the Kh\u00e1n of Khel\u00e1t's rule. The plain enclosed by the ridge mentioned above is divided into two parts by the Nari river: the western part, including D\u00e1dar, is politically included in the Khel\u00e1t district of Kachi; while the eastern part is Sibi proper, and was formerly subordinate to the Afghan Governor of Kandah\u00e1r.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The boundaries on the west, south, and south-east are the Nari and the low ridge mentioned above. On the north and north-east the boundaries are the outer ranges of the hills occupied by the Marris and the Dumar Path\u00e1ns. The only other hills in Sibi are a group of low, pebbly hillocks in the centre of the plain, on one of which stands the fort of Sibi.\n\nThe principal stream issuing from the northern hills is the Nari, the most considerable river of the Indus drainage-system south of the\nG\u00famal pass. Its drainage basin probably includes the plain of Thal Choti\u00e1li and the greater part of the Kakar country. It affords a perennial supply of water as far south as B\u00e1gh. After leaving the hills it flows through a depressed alluvial plain from 2 to 3 miles wide, bounded on either side by a high bank. The centre channel of the river brings down a perennial supply of water, and other channels to the east and west are filled during flood. The alluvial plain between the high banks is called the Nari Kach, and is very seldom inundated.\n\nThe stream of next importance to the Nari is the Thali torrent, which drains a considerable portion of the Marri hills and emerges into the plain through a narrow defile called the Thali Tonkh, the whole length of which is occupied by a deep pool. The perennial supply of water flowing in and out of the pass is not great, and serves in the cold weather to fill only one canal, which waters some of the Thali lands. Heavy floods come down in the hot weather, and the water is used to irrigate the kharif crops of cotton and jo\u00e1r at Thali and Mal.\n\nBetween the Nari and the Thali some minor torrents drain the outer range of hills. These are the Arand, Gh\u00e1zi, and Chimmar, the water of which is available for land cultivation for the kharif crops.\n\nThe soil of the greater part of the plain is clay, of the same nature as that of Kachi generally. In the Nari Kach, or the depressed basin of the Nari, it is a fertile, sandy loam, covered with a dense jungle, which reproduces itself in two or three years after clearing. It is composed mostly of tamarisk, Tamarix articulata (gazl\u00e1i) and Tamarix dioica (gaz, lawa kar lava); the thorn or thand tree (kakar, kandi), Prosopis spicigera; the j\u00e1l tree, Salvadora oleoides (phir, kabbar, j\u00e1l); the bab\u00fal, Acacia Jacquemonti (chighird, babhar); and a great variety of grasses, the most valuable kinds for grazing being sandil, sain (sui, garkha), and afd\u00edrik or mamhar, Panicum antidotale (gom gomadhi), valuable only for its small grain, eaten in time of scarcity. Saccharum Sara (kikh) and Cymbopogon twarancusa (nadakh) are also common, as well as the camel-thorn, Alhagi maurorum (shinz jowaha). On the central plain the jungle is not so dense as in the Kach. The ground, wherever it has lain fallow for a year or two, is covered with patches of scrubby jungle; and extensive tracts are overgrown with different salsolaceous plants (lana and kh\u00e1l) and camel-thorn. In some places, especially west of Khajak, there is dense jungle of Prosopis spicigera, Zizyphus nummularia, and Capparis aphylla. Salvodora persica (tozh, zhit) is occasionally found; and near the hills Arthanthera Vimivea (kh\u00edp, hidhishk) and Calligonum polygonoides (phog). Near the village the k\u00edkar (Acacia arabica) and ber (Zizyphus jujuba) are cultivated.\n\nWild hog and ravine deer are abundant; and, among birds, the black\nand grey partridge, the *haubara*, *kunj*, sand-grouse, quail, and pigeon are the commonest.\n\n**Agriculture.**\u2014Cultivation depends entirely on irrigation, which is mainly from the Nari river. Just below the exit of this stream from the hills, a rough embankment of stones and turf has been thrown half-way across the stream, and by this means a supply of water is turned into four canals.\n\nThe crops chiefly cultivated are wheat, barley, and mustard-seed in the cold weather, and *jodr*, cotton, and *til* or sesamum in the hot. The amount of land under cultivation is small. The land is allowed two years' fallow between each crop, and the crops are consequently of good quality. Wheat, which is the staple crop, is extremely fine, especially in the Kach, where the soil is lighter and more sandy than on the central plain, and does not require the same amount of water. The cotton is also very fine, the bushes attaining a great size, especially near Thalli. They are planted in lines at a sufficient distance apart to allow of their expanding to their full size. Much of the ground, especially in the Kach, seems well suited for the cultivation of rice; but this is not understood or practised, the reason being probably the uncertainty of the water-supply in the hot weather. Near the villages a few trees are planted, chiefly *ber* or *kunar* (*Zizyphus jujuba*) and *kikar* (*Acacia arabica*).\n\n**Population.**\u2014The population consists of Path\u00e1ns, Rind Bal\u00fach\u00eds, Brahu\u00eds, J\u00e1ts, and Hindus, distributed as follows:\u2014Path\u00e1ns, 6150; Bal\u00fach\u00eds, 750; Brahu\u00eds, 300; J\u00e1ts, artisans, etc., 4600; and Hindus, 2100: total, 13,900.\n\nThe Path\u00e1ns are the most influential. Their tribes are the B\u00e1rakzais, Pannis, and Khajaks, besides scattered families of other tribes. The Nod\u00e1ni Hassanis are also commonly classed as Path\u00e1ns, although they claim to be part of the Hassani tribe who formerly inhabited the Sham plain, and are now scattered about Barkhan and Thal Choti\u00e1li; and this tribe is usually classed as Bal\u00fach\u00ed. The Silanchis of Thali also rank as Path\u00e1ns. The Rind Bal\u00fach\u00eds are mostly of the Ghul\u00e1m Bolak tribe. There are scattered families of the Per, Chandya, Gur-chani, Lashari, Pitafi, Bughti, Gurgej, Lund, and Gishkori tribes. The Brahu\u00eds are mostly of the Gwaharamzai tribe, and live at Mal and Kurk.\n\nJ\u00e1ts are found in most of the villages; and there are also a considerable number of artisans and workmen, such as washermen, potters, barbers, carpenters, blacksmiths, butchers, etc. Hindu shopkeepers are also numerous.\n\nThe B\u00e1rakzai family hold the foremost rank in Sibi. The chief of the Pannis is a B\u00e1rakzai, and under the Afgh\u00e1n Government the office of Naib was always held by him.\nThe remainder of the Pannis are divided into five sections\u2014the Marghazanis, Saphis, Kurks, and Mizris living in Kurk, and the Dahpals living in Sibi.\n\nThe Khajaks are Path\u00e1ns of the Kakar tribe; they live entirely in the town of Khajak, and are divided into eight sections. They are but little under the control of the hereditary chief. The Khajaks used to be at perpetual feud with the B\u00e1rakzais and Pannis; but peace has been made since the occupation of the country by the British Government.\n\nThe Nod\u00e1ni Hassanis number about 264, and are scattered about in Kurk, Khajak, Sibi, and their original village of Gulu Shahr, which they recently abandoned.\n\nThe Silanchis are a tribe of Path\u00e1ns living in Thali. They number 660.\n\nThe other Path\u00e1ns, besides those mentioned above, are of the following tribes:\u2014Abdull\u00e1, Khaili, Piar\u00e1ni, Jaduni, Sodi, Pirang, Dahar, and Davi. They number altogether about 336 souls.\n\nThe Gwaharamzai tribe of Brahuis are settled at Mal and Kurk. They number about 216 in the former place, and 84 in the latter.\n\nThe Rind Bal\u00fach\u00eds, comprising the Ghul\u00e1m Bolaks and Pers, occupy the village of Bukhru or Ghul\u00e1m Bolak. They number about 480. The other Bal\u00fach\u00eds scattered about Kurk, Sibi, and Thali are of the Gurchani, Lashari, Pitafi, Bughti, Chandya, Gurgej, Lund, and Gishkori tribes; they number 264.\n\nThe J\u00e1ts are found in all the villages except Ghul\u00e1m Bolak, and are generally tenants of the Path\u00e1n proprietors. The most considerable tribes are the Baghw\u00e1ns (Arains), Muchis, and Hambis. The trading classes, artisans, and shopkeepers are found mostly in Kurk, Khajak, and Sibi.\n\nThe seven inhabited towns or villages are\u2014Sibi, Kurk, Khajak, Gulu Shahr, Ghul\u00e1m Bolak or Bakr\u00ed, Thali, and Mal. The ruins of numerous deserted villages indicate that the population of the country was formerly much greater than at present. The languages spoken are Pushtu, Bal\u00fach\u00ed, Sindh\u00ed, and Brahui. Sindh\u00ed and Bal\u00fach\u00ed are commonly understood throughout the country.\n\nTrade, etc.\u2014The local industries are unimportant. Coarse cloth is woven for home consumption. There is a considerable manufacture of barilla or sajj\u00ed, which is of superior quality, as only the khal bush (which is very plentiful) is used, and the other kinds of salsolaceous plants are not mixed with it, as is often done elsewhere.\n\nTrade is carried on both with Sind and Khoras\u00e1n. The articles imported from Khoras\u00e1n are rice, m\u00fag, d\u00e1l, goats\u2019 hair-thread (for ropes), namda or felt, wool, almonds, and boris or bags for carrying goods. From Sind come sugar, gur, sweetmeats, spices, salt, and cloth of all sorts. The exports to Sind include part of the imports from\nKhor\u00e1s\u00e1n. The local products exported are wool, gh\u00ed, barilla or sajj\u00ed, and wheat, barley, and jo\u00e1r.\n\nHistory.\u2014Of the early history of Sibi, but little is known. Tradition represents it as having been at one time the centre of a considerable kingdom which embraced the whole of the hill country to the north, and which still bears the name of Sew\u00edst\u00e1n. The communications with Thal Choti\u00e1li are easy, and the route through Sibi to that part of Afgh\u00e1n\u00edst\u00e1n was a well-known one till closed by the depredations of the Marris.\n\nThe earliest historical mention of Sibi occurs in B\u00e1bar\u2019s autobiography (Leydn\u2019s B\u00e1bar, ed. 1826, p. 164). B\u00e1bar was marching from the Indus to Choti\u00e1li, probably via the Sakhi Sarwar pass. He passed through the country of Rudi, which seems to be the Barkhan valley, and there found Fazil Gokaltash, the Darogah of Sibi, who had come out with 20 men to reconnoitre. Fazil Gokaltash was in the service of Sh\u00e1h Beg Arghan. This was in A.H. 911 (A.D. 1505). Sh\u00e1h Beg was son of Zulnun Beg, Governor of Kandah\u00e1r, under the Khor\u00e1s\u00e1n kings, and ultimately (in A.H. 928, A.D. 1521) conquered the whole of Sind, and established the Arghan dynasty there (Briggs\u2019 Ferishta, ed. 1829, vol. iv. p. 432). B\u00e1bar\u2019s conquests do not seem to have extended so far south as Sibi, which probably remained in the hands of the Arghans.\n\nTo this period belongs the legendary hero of the Bal\u00fach\u00eds, M\u00edr Chakar, who is said to have founded the fort of Sibi. He appears to be identical with M\u00edr Chakar Rind, who is mentioned by Ferishta as having come to M\u00falt\u00e1n and obtained a j\u00e1g\u00edr at Uchh in A.D. 1520 (Briggs\u2019 Ferishta, vol. iv. p. 396). The Bal\u00fach\u00eds seem to have been very powerful at M\u00falt\u00e1n, and were able to afford protection to Daulat Kh\u00e1n Lod\u00ed when he fled from Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Kh\u00e1n in A.D. 1524 (Briggs\u2019 Ferishta, vol. ii. p. 38).\n\nThe legends represent M\u00edr Chakar to have been at perpetual war with Hum\u00e1y\u00fan (Human Chughatta), and this may have a historical foundation in the attacks made on Hum\u00e1y\u00fan by Bal\u00fach\u00eds on his flight towards Kandah\u00e1r (Erskine\u2019s B\u00e1bar and Hum\u00e1y\u00fan).\n\nAfter the conquest of Sind by the Mughals, Sibi must have formed part of the Mughal Empire, and so continued till the rise of the Dur\u00e1ni kingdom under Ahmad Sh\u00e1h. The settlement in Sibi of the Khajaks, B\u00e1rakzais, Pannis, and other Path\u00e1ns had probably taken place before this, and the country remained attached to the power holding Kandah\u00e1r. As the Dur\u00e1ni kingdom broke up, Sibi passed with the rest of Afgh\u00e1n\u00edst\u00e1n under the rule of the B\u00e1rakzai Sird\u00e1rs, the chief of the B\u00e1rakzais acting as Naib under the rulers of Kandah\u00e1r. From 1839 to 1842, Sibi was occupied by the British in the name of Sh\u00e1h Shuja. The old fort was put into repair and used as a commissariat d\u00e9p\u00f4t.\nGranaries were built, which are still in existence, and are now undergoing repairs. The revenue was collected in kind at one-third of the gross produce. The Khajaks refused to pay on one occasion, and a force was sent against them, which destroyed their town. After their submission, they were allowed to pay only one-fifth of the gross produce as revenue, in order to enable them to repair their houses.\n\nIn 1843, Sibi came again under B\u00e1rakzai rule, Kh\u00e1n D\u00edl Kh\u00e1n and S\u00e1d\u00edk Muhammad Kh\u00e1n being Sird\u00e1rs of Kandah\u00e1r. They continued to collect the revenue in kind till 1846\u201347, when the cash assessment, which has prevailed till the present day, was introduced. The country was for long in a distracted condition owing to internal dissensions and the ravages of the Marris.\n\nSibi is one of the Afgh\u00e1n districts assigned to the British Government by the treaty of Gandamak. Since then its condition has been uneventful and prosperous. Its administration is carried on under the control of the Governor-General\u2019s Agent in Bal\u00fachist\u00e1n. It forms part of the charge of the Political Agent of Thal Choti\u00e1li, in subordination to whom there are a native Assistant Agent, a t\u0101hsild\u00e1r, and a munsif. No troops are regularly stationed in the district, but there are police and tribal levies.\n\nUnder Afgh\u00e1n rule, the revenue of the district was represented by a fixed payment of \u00a31000, which was remitted to the Am\u00edr\u2019s treasury by the chief of the B\u00e1rakzais. Under British administration, the revenue is collected in kind at uniform rates of one-fifth of the gross produce in the rabi crop, and one-sixth in the khar\u00edf, amounting in value to \u00a311,215 in 1884\u201385.\n\nThe town of Sibi has developed very largely of late, and is now administered on municipal principles. It is a station on the newly opened Sind-Pish\u00edn Railway, the head-quarters of the Political Agent, and in the cold weather of the Agent to the Governor-General in Bal\u00fachist\u00e1n.\n\n**Sibi.**\u2014Village with religious fair in T\u00famk\u00far District, Mysore State. \u2014See Shibi.\n\n**Sibpur (Shibpur).**\u2014Suburb of Howrah town, H\u00fagl\u00ed District, Bengal; situated in lat. 22\u00b0 34' N., and long. 88\u00b0 16' E., opposite Fort William. The place has grown since the beginning of this century from a small village into a flourishing town; inhabited chiefly by Government and other clerks, and by labourers employed on the various mills and foundries, and on the East Indian Railway works. On the river-side are the Albion works, consisting of a flour-mill and a distillery. To the south of Sibpur are the Royal Botanical Gardens, one of the finest of their kind in the world. A little above the gardens, an important technical school of industry\u2014the Sibpur Engineering College\u2014occupies the buildings and premises of the old \u2018Bishops\nCollege,' now transferred to Calcutta. Sibpur is a permanent mart for District produce; bricks are largely made and exported to Calcutta.\n\n**Sibs\u00e1gar (Seelsaugor).**\u2014A British District in the upper valley of Assam, lying between $26^\\circ 19'$ and $27^\\circ 16'$ N. lat., and between $93^\\circ 21'$ and $95^\\circ 25'$ E. long. Area, 2855 square miles. Population (as ascertained by the Census of 1881), 370,274 souls. Bounded on the north and east by Lakhimpur District, the Brahmaputra marking the boundary for the greater part of the distance; on the south by the N\u00e1g\u00e1 Hills District; and on the west by Nowgong District. The administrative head-quarters are at **SIBSAGAR TOWN**, situated about 11 miles inland from the south bank of the Brahmaputra.\n\n**Physical Aspects.**\u2014The District presents the appearance of a level plain, much overgrown with grass and jungle, and intersected by numerous tributaries of the Brahmaputra. Along the bank of the great river and its branches, the land lies very low, and is exposed to annual inundation; in the interior, the country rises towards the N\u00e1g\u00e1 Hills in the background, and the cane-brakes and grassy swamps of the valley give place to jungles of heavy timber. The District is divided by the little stream of the Dis\u00e1i into two tracts, which differ in soil and general appearance. East of the Dis\u00e1i the surface is very flat, and the soil consists of a heavy loam of a whitish colour, which is well adapted for rice cultivation. The general level is only broken by the long lines of embankments which were raised by the Aham kings, to serve both as roadways and as a protection against floods. West of the Dis\u00e1i, though the surface soil is of the same character, the general aspect is diversified by the protrusion of the subsoil. The latter is a stiff clay, abounding in iron nodules, and furrowed by frequent ravines and watercourses, which divide the cultivable fields into innumerable small sunken patches, locally known as *holds*.\n\nIn the inner part of the District towards the hills, the country is clothed in dense forest with an underwood of thorny creepers, which swarm with leeches when the rains begin to set in. This latter region is generally preferred for tea cultivation, as high forest glades are considered more suitable for the tea-plant than grass land. Where the land still lies waste in the tract in which the husbandmen cultivate rice, it is overgrown with tall grass from 15 to 20 feet high, amid which are isolated patches of cultivation.\n\nThere are no mountains within the limits of the District. The chief river is the Brahmaputra, forming the continuous northern boundary, which is navigable all the year through by steamers and large native boats. Its principal tributaries, beginning from the north-east, are the Dihing, which for part of its course divides Sibs\u00e1gar from Lakhimpur District; the Disang, Dikhu, Thanzi, Dis\u00e1i, Kakadung\u00e1, and the Dhaneswar\u00ed or Dhansir\u00ed, which all flow in a northerly direction from\nthe N\u00e1g\u00e1 Hills. The most signal example of alluvion in the whole Province is afforded by the M\u00e1juli char, included within the District of Sibs\u00e1g\u00e1r. This island is included between the present stream of the Brahmaputra, which forms its southern boundary, and the old bed which forms its northern. The latter is now known as the Lohit river, and derives most of its water from the great affluent, the Subans\u00edr\u00ed, which brings down from the north much of the silt of which the island is formed. The soil is a rich alluvium suitable for every kind of crop. It contains an area of about 400 square miles, almost entirely overgrown with grass and jungle. The fisheries of the District, which are Government property, yield an annual revenue of about \u00a32300 a year. There are no lakes, canals, or artificial watercourses in Sibs\u00e1g\u00e1r; but there are many extensive marshy wastes, in which rattans and canes grow wild, and long-stemmed varieties of rice are cultivated.\n\nWild beasts of all kind abound, including elephants, rhinoceros, tigers, bears, buffaloes, and deer. In 1882-83, \u00a3800 was paid to Government for the privilege of capturing wild elephants.\n\nAmong the trees indigenous to the forests of Sibs\u00e1g\u00e1r, and producing valuable timber, are the s\u00fam (Artocarpus Chaplasha), gam\u00e1ri (Gmelina arborea), pom\u00e1 (Cedrela Toona), and some species of Lagerstroemia and Dillenia. All these trees grow to a great height, and throw out numerous branches. Their wood is used for many purposes, and the most durable canoes are made from it. Next in importance to these timber trees are the k\u00e1th\u00e1l (Artocarpus integrifolia), uriam (Bischoffia javanica), k\u00e1l\u00e1 j\u00e1m (Syzygium Jambolana), titli (Tamarindus indica), some specimens of takr\u00e1 (Bauhinia) and nahor (Mesua ferrea). Of all the plants of the District, the bamboo is the most useful. The natives have several specific names for the different varieties of the bamboo; such as j\u00e1nti-b\u00e1ns, bh\u00e1luk\u00e1-b\u00e1ns, m\u00e1k\u00e1l-b\u00e1ns, bazal-b\u00e1ns, etc. The trees used for rearing silkworms on are the adakur (Tetrantha quadrifolia), s\u00fam (Machilus odoratissima), pil\u00e1-champ\u00e1 (Michelia pulneyensis), and eri\u00e1 (Ricinus communis). Rattans grow wild throughout the waste lands, so luxuriantly as to form an almost impenetrable jungle. Innumerable varieties of creepers are found. The jungle products consist of caoutchouc, lac, beeswax, and various fibres and dyes. Ivory is also exported. The M\u00e1lo Kali\u00e1ni Diha and Arali T\u00e1l are large patches of grazing ground, used during the winter months as pasturage for thousands of buffaloes and cows, but covered with water during the rains. The mineral wealth of the District is said to comprise coal, iron, petroleum, and salt, but none of these have been profitably worked. A little gold dust is washed in several of the hill streams. Some hot sulphur springs are situated near the banks of the Dhanesw\u00e1ri, and its tributary the Nambar; but they lie beyond the border in the N\u00e1g\u00e1 Hills District.\nHistory.\u2014Sibs\u00e1gar District first rose into prominence as the headquarters of the Aham dynasty, which ruled Assam for about 400 years before the British annexation. Prior to the advent of the Ahams, the dominant race was the Chuti\u00e1s, of a kindred origin to the Ahams, who only subjugated the Chuti\u00e1s after a fierce contest. At the present day, these two tribes form nearly one-half of the total population. The Ahams, a people of Shan origin, are said to have first made their appearance in Upper Assam in the 14th century, after the downfall of the legendary Hindu kingdom of K\u00e1mr\u00fap. They gradually spread down the valley of the Brahmaputra, until in the 17th century they were able to hold their own at Gauh\u00e1t\u00ed against repeated invasions of the Mughals. It does not appear that they brought any religion with them from their native hills; but in course of years they fell under the influence of Hinduism, and at the same time lost the virtues of military and civil administration, by means of which they had founded their empire. At last, in order to protect themselves against internal dissensions, they were compelled to call in the assistance of the Burmese, who tyrannized over the country with great severity, until they were in their turn driven out by the British in 1823.\n\nThe original capital of the Ahams was at Garhgaon in this District, on the Dikhu river, a short distance south-east of Sibs\u00e1gar town, where numerous ruins are still to be seen. The city and its suburbs appear to have extended over many square miles; and the royal palace itself was surrounded by a brick wall, about 2 miles in circumference. It has been noticed that one of the many gateways is built of large blocks of stone bearing marks of iron crampings, which show traces that they once belonged to a far more ancient edifice\u2014thus attesting the primitive Hindu traditions of K\u00e1mr\u00fap as told in the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata. The whole is now overgrown with dense jungle; and the natural course of decay has been hastened by the hand of man, for the old bricks are found serviceable on the tea-gardens of the present day.\n\nThe second Aham capital was at Rangpur, immediately to the south of Sibs\u00e1gar town, which is said to have been founded in 1698 by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Rudra Singh, the first Aham prince who submitted himself to the Br\u00e1hmans. The ruins of his palace, and a temple which he built at Jais\u00e1g\u00e1r, still exist amid the deep jungle. To the eldest son of this monarch is assigned the excavation of the great tank, 114 acres in area, around which has been built the modern station of Sibs\u00e1gar. Rangpur continued as the royal residence until 1784, when the Aham kingdom began to be dismembered. The R\u00e1j\u00e1, named Gaurin\u00e1th, fled before his rebellious subjects, who had advanced against him from the east. He first stopped at Jorh\u00e1t on the Dis\u00e1i river, in the centre of Sibs\u00e1gar District, but was ultimately compelled to retire to Gauh\u00e1t\u00ed.\nWith British assistance, he was enabled to return to Jorh\u00e1t, where he died in 1793.\n\nApart from the ruins of successive capitals, the Ahams have left permanent traces of their power in the great lines of embankment running through the country, which are locally known as \u00e1l\u00eds. These were constructed by a system of forced labour, and served both as roads and as protections against river floods. The entire method of Aham administration was based upon personal servitude. The country was parcelled out into executive Districts, each of which was under the control of a taskmaster; no money revenue was demanded, but compulsory service was exacted from every individual among the subject races as his contribution to the needs of the State. The recollection of this organized slavery still lives in the minds of the people. At the present day, it is found almost impossible to obtain labourers to work on the roads, or other Government undertakings. The peasantry are willing to take employment on the tea-gardens, when not occupied on their own little plots of rice; but to work for Government is held to involve indelible disgrace. Hence it is that the great works of the Aham period have been suffered to fall into disrepair, and the incursions of the rivers have thrown much good land out of cultivation.\n\nWhen the British expelled the Burmese from Assam in 1823, the Government was indisposed to undertake the responsibilities of administration beyond what seemed absolutely necessary. A military outpost was stationed at Sadiy\u00e1, at the extreme head of the Brahmaputra valley, but the civil government by European officials was not extended farther east than the confines of Nowgong. The tract that now forms Sibs\u00e1g\u00e1r District, together with the southern portion of Lakhimpur, was handed over to a native ruler, R\u00e1j\u00e1 Purandhar Singh, who was guaranteed the secure exercise of his authority on condition of paying a tribute of \u00a35000 a year. This unsatisfactory arrangement produced the results which might have been anticipated. The R\u00e1j\u00e1, protected by the British name from the consequences of his misrule, indulged himself in the most wanton oppressions upon his helpless subjects, and rendered their condition even more miserable than it had been under the Burmese invaders. It is on record that the country became so depopulated that it was unable to furnish the British tribute. Under these circumstances it was found necessary in 1838 to dispossess Purandhar Singh, and to place Sibs\u00e1g\u00e1r under the direct management of an English officer. The early reports of those days are confined to complaints of the extreme misery to which the country was reduced. The tea industry, however, has now brought back prosperity; and at the present time the Sibs\u00e1g\u00e1r peasants rank among the most contented and wealthy in Assam.\nPopulation.\u2014Mr. Robinson, in his *Descriptive Account of Assam* (1840), roughly estimated the population of Sibs\u00e1gar District, which then included great part of Lakhimpur, at 200,000 souls. Another estimate in 1853 gave a total of 211,477. The first regular Census was taken in 1871; and the enumeration, instead of being taken in a single night as in Bengal, was prolonged over the two months of November and December. The results disclosed a total of 296,589 persons, on an area corresponding to the present District. The Census of 1881 was synchronous, and was, as elsewhere throughout British India, effected on the night of the 17th February. It returned a total population of 370,274, showing an increase of 73,685, or 24\u00b783 per cent., for the nine years between 1872 and 1881. The natural increase of births over deaths accounts for about half this increase, the remainder being made up by immigration from Bengal.\n\nThe results of the Census of 1881 may be summarized as follows:\n\n\u2014Area of District, 2855 square miles, with 1 town and 1982 villages, and 63,576 houses. Population, 370,274, namely, males 195,194, and females 175,080; proportion of males, 52\u00b77 per cent. Average density of population, 129\u00b77 persons per square mile; towns or villages per square mile, 62; persons per town or village, 187; houses per square mile, 22\u00b73; persons per house, 5\u00b78. Classified according to sex and age, there were in 1881\u2014under 15 years of age, boys 77,164, and girls 73,849; total children, 151,013, or 40\u00b78 per cent. of the population: 15 years and upwards, males 118,030, and females 101,231; total adults, 219,261, or 59\u00b72 per cent.\n\nThe ethnical division of the people shows\u2014Europeans, 168; Eurasians, 139; aboriginal and semi-aboriginal tribes and castes, 215,224; Hindus, 139,075; Muhammadans, 15,665; and Chinese, 3. The chief feature in this classification is the large proportion of semi-Hinduized aborigines, as compared with the rest of Assam. On the one hand, the hill tribes of the northern Him\u00e1layas and of the eastern Burmese Mountains are poorly represented; while, on the other, the castes of Beng\u00e1li Hindus have not penetrated so far east. The great bulk of the population are pure Assamese, more or less converted to Hinduism. The once dominant race of Ahams, numbering 117,872, still supplies nearly one-third of the total population. Though they have now sunk to the level of common cultivators, they retain many of their ancient habits and institutions. Some of them eat beef and pork, and also bury instead of burning their dead. Next in number come the Chuti\u00e1s (29,952), who have already been referred to as of the same original stock as the Ahams, and their predecessors in the government of the upper valley of the Brahmaputra. The Kochs (24,248) are members of a tribe whose present head-quarters are in the Bengal State of Kuch Behar, but who ruled at one time over the\ngreater part of Assam, before the arrival of the Ahams. The Doms (22,867) are a curious race, who lay claim in Assam to high-caste purity, but reject the ministrations of Br\u00e1hmans. Bhumijs number 18,492. The aborigines proper include\u2014the Cachar\u00eds (19,753), who are largely employed on tea-gardens; M\u00edkirs (1403); N\u00e1g\u00e1s (1405); Shans (275); Lalungs (319); Mechs (228); G\u00e1ros (185); Manipur\u00eds (50); besides a sprinkling of Kols, Ur\u00e1ons, and Sant\u00e1l\u00eds, who are imported labourers from Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur.\n\nAmong the Hindus proper, Br\u00e1hmans number 11,607, being especially numerous for an Assam District; R\u00e1jputs, 1428; K\u00e1yasths, 3109; and Jain traders, from the north-west of India, 997. The most numerous caste in the District is the Kalit\u00e1 (33,812), who supplied the priesthood for the Kochs, Doms, and Ahams before the introduction of Br\u00e1hmanism. The Kalit\u00e1s now rank as pure S\u00fadras, on a level with the K\u00e1yasths, and are generally engaged in agriculture or Government service. Other Hindu castes include the following:\u2014Keut or Kewat, 17,736; Kat\u00e1n\u00ed, 5404; Munda or Murah, 3420; Kurm\u00ed, 3314; Bori\u00e1, 2791; Nat, 1963; Ganak, 1531; Har\u00ed, 1374; Kumbh\u00e1r, 1296; Baur\u00ed, 1207; T\u00e1nt\u00ed, 1198; Go\u00e1l\u00e1, 920; Gh\u00e1tw\u00e1l, 732; N\u00e1pit, 718; and Kah\u00e1r, 436.\n\nReligion.\u2014Classified according to religion, the population consists of\u2014Hindus (as loosely grouped together for religious purposes), 339,663, or 91\u00b78 per cent.; Musalm\u00e1ns, 15,665, or 4\u00b72 per cent.; Christians, 804 (including 462 native converts); Buddhists, 275; Jains, 37; Brahmo, 1; and non-Hindu aboriginal tribes, 13,829. There are five principal Hindu s\u00e1str\u00e1s or religious institutions of a monastic character, each presided over by its own high priest or gos\u00e1i\u00edn; and 83 minor s\u00e1str\u00e1s. The gos\u00e1i\u00edns have a large number of followers, and hold much revenue-free land, both in this and the other Assam Valley Districts. The Br\u00e1hma Sam\u00e1j is represented by a few followers, who are all immigrants from Bengal. The Muhammadans of Sibs\u00e1g\u00e1r are said to be descended partly from artisans introduced by an early Aham R\u00e1j\u00e1, and partly from soldiers left by the invading Mughal armies. Many of them have joined the Far\u00e1\u00edz\u00ed or reformed sect, but they are not actively fanatical, and have ceased to make proselytes. The native Christians are under the care of a branch of the American Baptist Mission, which has been established in Sibs\u00e1g\u00e1r since 1840. The Society is represented by two missionaries, one of whom usually resides in a village on the lower slopes of the N\u00e1g\u00e1 Hills, where he has charge of a considerable number of converts.\n\nUrban and Rural Population.\u2014The population of the District is entirely rural, being employed either on rice cultivation or the tea-gardens. They evince no tendency to gather into towns or seats of\ncommerce, and very few natives of Sibs\u00e1gar depend upon trade as a means of livelihood. Some few petty traders buy small quantities of goods from the M\u00e1rw\u00e1ri merchants who visit the District, and retail them in the village shops; but these have, almost without exception, their little patches of arable land which they cultivate themselves, and from which their household wants are supplied. The only place with a population of more than 5000 is SIBSAGAR Town, which contains (1881) 5868 inhabitants. It is situated about 9 miles inland from the south bank of the Brahmaputra, and, besides the houses of the civil officials, possesses a large b\u00e1z\u00e1r, in which a brisk business is conducted during the cold season with the neighbouring hill tribes. JORHAT, on the Dis\u00e1i river in the centre of the District (population 1978), is the home of several M\u00e1rw\u00e1ri and Muhamadan traders, who supply the wants of the labourers on the tea-gardens. GOLAGHAT, on the Dhaneswar\u00ed (population 1754), is the only seat of river traffic in the District, being accessible to steamers from May to November. It is now a fairly large station, with a good b\u00e1z\u00e1r, treasury, telegraph office, and d\u00e1k bungalow; it is also the seat of an Assistant Commissioner. NAZIRA, on the Dikhu, about 9 miles from Sibs\u00e1gar by road, is the head-quarters of the Assam Tea Company, containing a large b\u00e1z\u00e1r, several good European houses, steam mill, and store for English goods. The ruins of GARHGAON and RANGPUR have been already referred to.\n\nOf the 1983 villages or clusters of hamlets, 1548 contain less than two hundred inhabitants; 413 between two and five hundred; 19 between five hundred and a thousand; and only 3 more than one thousand.\n\nAs regards occupation, the Census of 1881 returned the male population of Sibs\u00e1gar District under the following six main headings:\n\n- (1) Official and professional class, 1337;\n- (2) domestic class, 666;\n- (3) commercial class, including merchants, traders, carriers, etc., 3242;\n- (4) agricultural and pastoral class, including gardeners, 119,608;\n- (5) industrial class, including all manufacturers and artisans, 1681;\n- (6) indefinite and non-productive class, comprising general labourers and male children, 68,660.\n\nMaterial Condition of the People.\u2014The inhabitants of the District are described as a contented and happy people, having but few wants, and those very easily supplied, as rice is almost the only article grown for food, the rest being obtainable from the jungles and streams. They still live, however, in the same primitive manner as their forefathers; their agricultural implements and cattle, their food and clothing, being all exactly as they were fifty years ago. A marked indication of the prosperity of the people is the great difficulty experienced in obtaining labour, even at high rates of wages. If there is any exception to the general prosperity, it is amongst a few families of the better class, the members of which are, or consider themselves to be, above manual\nlabour. They find it getting more and more difficult to get their holdings cultivated for them, and to keep up the social position they formerly enjoyed.\n\nThe shopkeeping class generally live in somewhat substantial buildings, consisting of two or more rooms under a single roof; while the dwelling of a common husbandman usually consists of two or three small detached huts, each containing from two to four rooms, and constructed of wood, bamboo, grass, and reeds. These huts are very low, damp, ill-ventilated, and built so close to one another as to render them almost inaccessible to light and air. Each hut seldom has more than one small door, just large enough to admit one man at a time, and has no windows at all. The houses are grouped together into villages, without any regard to arrangement or sanitary considerations. They are generally surrounded with clumps of bamboos, plantain, betel-nut, and sim trees, and, viewed from a distance, present a very picturesque aspect. Small quantities of tobacco, mustard, and sugar-cane are cultivated in the immediate vicinity of the villages, each family raising sufficient to supply its own household wants.\n\nThe ordinary food of the people consists of rice, pulses, fish, and vegetables. The use of flesh as an article of food is very rare. The vegetables used by all classes of natives consist chiefly of leaves and tender stems, generically called s\u0101g. Other vegetables, such as potatoes, carrots, cabbages, turnips, onions, etc., are grown to a small extent, for sale to the European residents. Milk is very little used by the mass of the people, though dahi (butter-milk) is much consumed by the higher classes. The lower classes seldom use oil; and instead of salt, they use potash procured by burning plantain leaves. Clarified butter and sugar are only consumed by the comparatively wealthy. Both shopkeepers and cultivators raise nearly every article of food they require for domestic consumption.\n\nAgriculture, etc.\u2014The staple crop throughout the District is rice, which furnishes two great harvests in the year. The s\u0101l\u012b, corresponding to the \u0101man of Bengal, is sown on low lands about June, transplanted in the following month, and reaped in November. Its finer varieties are sometimes comprised under the generic term of l\u0101h\u012b. The dhu or d\u016bs is sown on high lands about March, and reaped in July, leaving the field ready for a cold-weather crop of pulses or oil-seeds. A third crop of rice, called b\u0101o, is grown on the borders of marshes or the banks of rivers, being sown about April, and reaped in November. This is a long-stemmed variety, and can keep pace in its growth with the rise of flood water. The other crops include Indian corn, several varieties of pulses, mustard grown as an oil-seed, sugar-cane, p\u0101n or betel-leaf, and cotton and indigo raised only by the hill tribe of M\u012br\u012bs. The sim tree (Machilus odoratissima) is an important object of attention\nin the neighbourhood of villages, for the sake of the silkworm that feeds on its leaves.\n\nAccording to the most recent statistics, the area under cultivation in 1883\u201384 was 327,221 acres, or less than one-fifth of the total area of the District, though the greater part of the remainder is capable of tillage. Crop area in 1883\u201384\u2014Rice, 211,332 acres; other food-grains, including pulses, 5895 acres; oil-seeds, 10,157 acres; sugar-cane, 4311 acres; tea, 40,532 acres; other crops, 62,869 acres; total, 335,096 acres, of which 7875 acres produced two crops in the year. Manure, in the form of cow-dung, is only used for sugar-cane and other special crops. Irrigation is adopted in the case of sili rice, when water can be easily obtained from natural watercourses. It is not customary to allow land to lie fallow. Spare land abounds on all sides, and the present tenures are favourable to the cultivator. As throughout the rest of Assam, the State is the general landlord, but the cultivators, either by contract or status, possess a heritable and transferable right in all land cultivated permanently. Under native rule, the main source of revenue was a sort of capitation tax, raised at the rate of 4s. on each plough, and 2s. on each hoe. The first land settlement, commenced in 1839, assessed the revenue at 1s. 6d. an acre on rupit or moist lands, on which sili rice is grown, and 9d. an acre on all other lands. In 1844 these rates were raised respectively to 1s. 10d. and 1s. 4d. At the present time, basti or homestead land pays 6s. an acre; rupit, 3s. 9d. an acre; and faringhati, on which dus rice and other crops are grown, 3s. an acre. The average out-turn of paddy from an acre of rice land is estimated to amount to about 14 cwts., worth about \u00a32. This, after husking, would give about 9 cwts. of rice, locally worth \u00a33, 6s.\n\nSpare Land.\u2014There is a very large quantity of spare land in Sibsagar, and the present tenures are undoubtedly favourable to the cultivator. Waste lands for the extension of tea cultivation have been granted at very favourable rates. Those granted to the Assam Company were given rent-free for twenty years; after the expiration of that term, a rent is payable of 1s. 2d. per acre for three years; and thereafter 2s. 3d. per acre for a further period of twenty-two years. All the ordinary arable lands in the District are held by the cultivators on a lease direct from Government.\n\nLandless Labouring Classes.\u2014There appears to be no tendency towards the growth of a separate class of day-labourers in the District, neither renting nor possessing land of their own. On the contrary, the class who used formerly to cultivate the lands of others seems to be decreasing in numbers, and the want of labour is seriously felt. Men who cultivate the fields of others are termed bandis, and generally receive in exchange for their labour merely their food and clothing, with a small\nallowance of money. The Assamese form a comparatively small part of the labourers employed in the tea-gardens, coolies being imported from Bengal for this purpose. Those natives of the District who do seek employment on the tea plantations generally have small farms of their own, on which they cultivate sufficient for their own household wants. The Cacharis furnish a considerable proportion of the labour on the tea-gardens. Women and children are not largely employed in the fields except at the sowing and harvesting seasons.\n\nThe rate of wages for ordinary unskilled labour is said to have doubled within the past twenty years, owing to the extension of tea cultivation; and the demand for skilled labour has risen in a still greater proportion. Indeed, labour of all kinds requires to be imported from Bengal. A common day-labourer is procurable with difficulty at 6d. a day. Male coolies on the tea-gardens are engaged at 10s. a month, and women at 8s.; but these rates can be almost doubled by taking taskwork. A second-rate blacksmith or carpenter receives \u00a33 or \u00a34 a month, and a bricklayer \u00a31, 12s. The prices of food-grains have risen in like proportion. The following are the rates for 1872, which were somewhat above the average of recent years:\u2014Common rice, 7s. 2d. per cwt.; pulses, from 9s. 9d. to 13s. per cwt.; oil, \u00a32, 6s. per cwt.; salt, 10s. 8d. per cwt. In 1866, the year of the Orissa famine, the price of common rice rose to 14s. per cwt.\n\nSibs\u00e1gar District is not especially exposed to either of the calamities of flood or drought. The valley of the Brahmaputra is subject to annual inundation, owing to the old embankments having been allowed to fall into a bad state of repair; but it is not known that the general harvest of the District has ever been affected thereby. Partial drought is sometimes caused by deficiency of local rainfall. The season of 1857 is still remembered by the people as having resulted in a scarcity from this cause, which raised the price of common unhulled rice to 7s. 6d. per cwt. The people mainly depend for their food supply on the s\u00e1l\u00ed rice crop; and if this were to fail, it would be difficult to supply its place either from the other crops or by importation.\n\nManufactures, etc.\u2014The local industries are limited to the weaving of silk and cotton cloth, the making of domestic utensils from brass and bell metal, and a coarse description of pottery. The silk cloth is woven of various degrees of fineness, and is divided into four classes: \u2014mej\u00e1nkuri, the finest of all from the cocoons of a worm fed on the ad\u00e1kuri tree; p\u00e1t, from the Chinese silkworm fed on the mulberry; mug\u00e1, the best known, from a worm fed on the s\u00edm tree; and er\u00edd, which is very coarse, from a worm fed on the castor-oil plant. The finest raw silk has been sold for as much as \u00a31, 16s. per pound; but the manufacture has greatly fallen off in recent years, owing to the\ncompetition of cotton piece-goods imported from Europe. The braziers are almost entirely supported by a system of advances made by M\u00e1rw\u00e1ri capitalists, at the rate of 6d. per pound for brass, and 1s. per pound for bell metal.\n\nCommerce and Trade.\u2014The trade of the District, also, is mainly confined to the M\u00e1rw\u00e1ris. The principal seats of commerce are Jorh\u00e1t, Golaghat, and Sibs\u00e1g\u00e1r town. The two latter places are the resort of large numbers of N\u00e1g\u00e1s during the cold season, who bring down raw cotton and vegetables to barter for salt, fish, poultry, and cattle. Cotton is commonly exchanged for half its weight of salt. There are no large annual fairs, similar to those held in Lower Assam. The principal exports from the District are tea, silk, mustard seed, cotton, and jungle products; the imports are salt, oil, opium, piece-goods, and miscellaneous hardware.\n\nTea.\u2014The cultivation and manufacture of tea is largely carried on by European capital and under European supervision; and in this industry Sibs\u00e1g\u00e1r ranks as the first District in Assam Proper, being only surpassed in the whole of India by Cachar District in the Surm\u00e1 valley. The Assam Tea Company, which commenced its operations in Lakhimpur, had opened fifteen factories in Sibs\u00e1g\u00e1r by 1852, with 2500 acres under cultivation, and an out-turn of 267,000 lbs. Soon after that date, many private gardens were taken up by Europeans and natives; and in 1869, after the recovery from the panic caused by excessive speculation, there were 110 gardens in cultivation, managed by 53 European and 233 native assistants, and employing a monthly average of 13,399 imported and 790 local labourers. The statistics for 1874 show 22,573 acres under cultivation, out of a total of 108,050 acres taken up, mostly in fee-simple; and an out-turn of 4,976,419 lbs. of tea, being an increase of 554,898 lbs. on the previous year. By 1883-84, the area under plant had increased to 40,532 acres, and the estimated out-turn (believed however to be excessive) to 12\u00bd million lbs., the average out-turn under mature plant being 335 lbs. per acre.\n\nThe chief means of communication in the District are afforded by the Brahmaputra and Dhaneswar\u00ed rivers, both navigable by steamers, but the latter only during the rains. The roads all follow the lines of the \u00e1lis or old embankments constructed by forced labour under the Aham kings. The Trunk Road, maintained by the Public Works Department, runs through the entire length of the District for a course of 133 miles. The aggregate length of the District roads in 1883 was returned at 420 miles, of which 305 miles were classed as important. Wheeled conveyances are now in general use, most of the roads having been bridged at river crossings.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The District administrative staff ordinarily consists of a Deputy Commissioner, two Assistant and four Extra-Assistant Com-\nmissioners, District Engineer with two Assistants, Civil Surgeon, and Superintendent of Police. In 1870-71, the total revenue of Sibs\u00e1gar District amounted to \u00a393,853, of which the land-tax contributed \u00a343,976, or 47 per cent., and \u00e1kk\u00e1ri or excise \u00a342,090, or 46 per cent.; the expenditure was \u00a335,194, or about two-fifths of the revenue, and the item of 'cost and conveyance of opium' absorbed \u00a313,842, which is properly a debit against the revenue from excise. By 1882 the revenue had increased to \u00a3125,645, while the expenditure was \u00a327,994. As throughout the rest of Assam, owing to the circumstance that an assessment is made annually with the cultivators, the land-tax is a very elastic source of revenue, having increased from \u00a37013 in 1840 to \u00a311,120 in 1850, and \u00a348,758 in 1875. In 1883 there were 3 covenanted European officers stationed in the District, and 10 magisterial and 7 civil and revenue courts open. The regular and municipal police force consisted of 335 officers and men, maintained at a cost of \u00a36188; showing 1 policeman to every 8\u00b75 square miles of area, or to every 1106 of the population, and an average cost of \u00a32, 3s. 4d. per square mile and 4d. per head of population. There is no village watch or rural police in the District. In the same year, the total number of persons convicted of any offence, great or small, was 458, or 1 to every 388 of the population. By far the greater number of the convictions were for petty offences. There is 1 jail at Sibs\u00e1gar town, and Sub-divisional lock-ups at Gol\u00e1gh\u00e1t and Jorh\u00e1t. In 1883, the daily average number of prisoners was 91\u00b77, of whom 2\u00b72 were females; the labouring convicts numbered 83\u00b77.\n\nAs is the case in Assam generally, education until recently had made but little progress among the people. In 1856, the number of schools in the District was only 12, attended by 794 pupils. The figures for 1860 show a positive decrease; but by 1870 the number of schools had risen to 29, and the pupils to 1084. The reforms of Sir G. Campbell, by which the benefit of the grant-in-aid rules was extended to the village schools or p\u00e1thsal\u00e1s, have produced scanty effect in this part of the country. In 1873, there were 39 schools under inspection, attended by 1440 pupils. By 1883, the number of State aided and inspected schools had increased to 159, attended on the 31st March 1884 by 5767 pupils. Indigenous vernacular unaided schools numbered 11, with 177 pupils. The Census Report of 1881 returned 2828 boys and 79 girls as under instruction, besides 6765 males and 171 females able to read and write but not under instruction. The chief educational establishments are the Government English school at Sibs\u00e1gar town, attended on 31st March 1884 by 224 pupils; the Jorh\u00e1t high school, with 255 pupils; the Assam Company's school at Nazir\u00e1, with 137 pupils; and the normal school, with 13 pupils.\n\nFor administrative purposes, the District is divided into the 3 Sub-\ndivisions of Sibs\u00e1gar, Jorh\u00e1t, and Gol\u00e1gh\u00e1t, and into 4 th\u00e1n\u00e1s or police circles, namely, Sibs\u00e1gar, Bartola, Jorh\u00e1t, and Gol\u00e1gh\u00e1t, with outpost stations at Selung, Kamlabari, and Dhansirimukh. The number of mauz\u00e1s or revenue collections of villages, each under a mauz\u00e1d\u00e1r or revenue official, is 65. The only municipality in the District is Sibs\u00e1gar town.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate of Sibs\u00e1gar, like that of the rest of the Assam valley, is comparatively mild and temperate. Scarcely a single month passes without some rain, but the year may be roughly divided into two seasons\u2014the dry and cold season, extending from October to the end of April, and the hot and rainy season, occupying the remainder of the year. Dense fogs prevail in the early mornings from November to February. The prevailing direction of the wind is from the north-east, and it seldom rises above the strength of a moderate breeze. The mean annual temperature at Sibs\u00e1gar town for a period of eight years ending 1881 is returned at $73^\\circ 3$\u00b0 F., ranging from a mean monthly maximum of $83^\\circ 5$\u00b0 in June to a mean minimum of $58^\\circ 6$\u00b0 in January. The average annual rainfall for a period of twenty-five years ending 1881 is returned at $94^\\circ 67$ inches, thus distributed\u2014January to May, $29^\\circ 28$ inches; June to September, $58^\\circ 47$ inches; October to December, $6^\\circ 92$ inches.\n\nThe prevailing diseases are fevers of a remittent and intermittent type, dysentery and diarrhoea, pulmonic affections, rheumatism, cutaneous disorders, leprosy, elephantiasis, and goitre. Sporadic cases of cholera occur almost every year; and in 1869 this disease made its appearance in an epidemic form from February to June, and is reported to have carried off about 700 persons. Epidemic small-pox breaks out about every fourth or fifth year, being propagated by the practice of inoculation. In 1883, out of a total number of 8655 deaths registered for the rural tracts, 4241 were assigned to fevers, 1851 to bowel complaints, 1112 to cholera, and 225 to small-pox. The total rural mortality was at the rate of $24^\\circ 02$ per thousand for the rural population, and in the three towns of Sibs\u00e1gar, Jorh\u00e1t, and Gol\u00e1gh\u00e1t at the rate of 24 per thousand. Three charitable dispensaries in the above towns afforded relief to 7701 in-door and out-door patients in 1883-84. Since 1869, a terrible epizootic has been raging among the cattle and buffaloes of the District. It is identified with the rinderpest of Europe, and is supposed to have been introduced from Bengal. The mortality has been very great, about two-thirds of the total number of cattle having been carried off.

Population (1881) 129,166, residing in 648 villages, and occupying 20,771 houses. Hindus number 118,691; Muhammadans, 6776; and \u2018others,\u2019 3699.\n\nSibs\u00e1gar.\u2014Chief town and civil head-quarters of Sibs\u00e1gar District, Assam; situated on the Dikhu river, 9 miles from the south bank of the Brahmaputra, in lat. 26\u00b0 59' 10\" N., and long. 94\u00b0 38' 10\" E. Population (1881) 5868, namely, Hindus, 4425; Muhammadans, 1351; and Christians, 92. Municipal income (1882\u201383), \u00a3660. Sibs\u00e1gar was one of the capitals of the Aham dynasty, shortly after their conversion to Hinduism. There still exists a magnificent tank, covering an area of 114 acres, with several old temples on its bank. These works are said to have been constructed by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Sib Singh about the year 1722. There are but few houses in the native town which are not in a dilapidated condition. The b\u00e1z\u00e1r, which runs along both banks of the Dikhu river, has been greatly improved of late years, and contains many iron-roofed houses and several good shops. Large daily market. The public buildings, and the houses of the European residents, are built along the embankment of the tank. Sibs\u00e1gar is the seat of some river trade. The trading community consist chiefly of up-country M\u00e1rv\u00e1ris, who have their head-quarters in Sibs\u00e1gar town, and branch shops at many of the larger tea-gardens. The exports are cotton, rice, and, most important of all, tea; the imports, piece-goods and brass-ware. During the cold season, parties of N\u00e1g\u00e1s from the hills bring down raw cotton and vegetables, to barter for salt, poultry, cattle, and dried fish. During the rainy season, a small steamer plies on the Dikhu river from Dikhumukh to Nazir\u00e1, calling at Sibs\u00e1gar.\n\nSiddh\u00e1pur.\u2014Sub-division of North K\u00e1nara District, Bombay Presidency; situated in the south-east corner of the District. Area, 239 square miles. Population (1872) 34,183; (1881) 35,658, namely, males 20,446, and females 15,212, occupying 5527 houses in 95 villages. Hindus number 34,606; Muhammadans, 827; and \u2018others,\u2019 225.\n\nSiddh\u00e1pur is covered with hills in the west, which in the south-west are thickly wooded, and in the north-west are bare. The valleys among the western hills are generally full of gardens. The centre of the Sub-division is a series of low hills, crossed by rich valleys and many perennial streams. In the east the hills are few, and the country stretches in wide fairly-wooded plains, in parts dotted with sugar-cane and rice-fields; the extreme south-east is hilly and thickly wooded, mostly with evergreen forests. The small streams are of great value for garden irrigation. In the west the soil is red, and in the valleys a rich alluvial mould. In the east the soil is red in places, but is not rich.\nThe chief products are\u2014rice, sugar-cane, Bengal gram (Cicer arietinum), kulthi (Dolichos biflorus), areca-nuts, pepper, cardamoms, betel-leaves, lemons, and oranges. Except in the west, where fever prevails during the later rains and the cold weather, the Sub-division is fairly healthy, and during the hot months the climate is agreeable. In 1883 the Sub-division contained 2 criminal courts; police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), 5; regular police, 47 men; village watch (chaukid\u00e1rs), 25. Land revenue, \u00a39054.\n\nThe forests of the Sahy\u00e1dris are the best in this region. They consist mostly of fine evergreens, admirable for their girth and height. The Siddh\u00e1pur forests have not been worked for profit; trees required locally and for public works are alone felled. The only exception is sandal-wood, which, when fit, is cut by the Forest Department. The felling and carrying charges are about \u00a34 per ton, and the sale price ranges from \u00a348 to \u00a354 per ton. Canes are general property; other products, such as myrobalans and soap-nuts, are gathered by the Forest Department.\n\nSiddh\u00e1pur.\u2014Village and head-quarters of Siddh\u00e1pur Sub-division, North K\u00e1nara District, Bombay Presidency; situated about 20 miles west of Hon\u00e1war.

Population (1881) 82,699, namely, Hindus, 70,019; Muhammadans, 12,680; number of villages, 224; houses, 12,177. The tract was originally in the hands of the Bhars, who were expelled by the Muhammadans at the time of the invasion of Sayyid S\u00e1l\u00e1r Mas\u00e1\u00fad. Sayyids still form a great part of the population. The pargan\u00e1 was first formed in the time of Akbar.\n\nSiddhaur.\u2014Town in Bara Banki District, Oudh, and head-quarters of Siddhaur pargan\u00e1; situated 16 miles west of Bara Banki town, in lat. 26\u00b0 46' N., and long. 81\u00b0 26' 10\" E. Population (1881) 3520, namely, Hindus 1811, and Muhammadans 1709. Number of houses, 743. School, registration office, and post-office.

There is a celebrated Hindu temple here; and about the 18th March an annual fair is held, attended by 3000 persons. At the same time, a religious gathering for bathing takes place on the opposite bank of the river. The place is traditionally stated to have been the abode of the famous Rishi Kapilamuni, a fellow-worker of Patanjali, the founder of one of the six systems of Hindu philosophy.\n\nSidhaut.\u2014T\u00e1luk or Sub-division of Cuddapah (Kadap\u00e1) District, Madras Presidency. Area, 610 square miles. Population (1881) 59,076, namely, males 30,015, and females 29,061, occupying 13,237 houses in 79 villages. Hindus number 55,202; Muhammadans, 3866; and Christians, 8. The soil is divided into red, sandy, and black. To these may be added saline and stony soils. The best land is in the Penner (Ponnaiy\u00e1r) valley, where water is easily obtained by sinking wells. Little land is cultivated except in the valleys, owing to the hills by which the t\u00e1luk is cut up. These hills are the Lankamallai, the Mallamakonda, and the P\u0101lkonda ranges. In addition to the ordinary grains, the principal products are indigo and cotton. The north-west line of the Madras Railway traverses the southern portion of the t\u00e1luk. In 1883 the t\u00e1luk contained 3 criminal courts; police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), 5; regular police, 49 men.

In early British times it was the capital of the District, and is now the head-quarters of a Deputy Collector and Magistrate. Sidhaut is a place of some importance and of considerable sanctity. Owing to fancied resemblance in its position on the Penner, and to the relative position of some neighbouring villages and rivers, it is sometimes known as Dakshina K\u00e1si, or the 'Southern Benares.' It is notable for its melons.\n\nSidhpur.\u2014Town in Baroda State, Gujar\u00e1t, Bombay; situated on the Saraswati river, in lat. 23\u00b0 55' 30\" N., long. 72\u00b0 26' E. Population (1872) 3534.

Said to have been founded in 1524 by Sivangi Gauda, a freebooter, whose family extended their power, and held the place for 87 years. Afterwards it passed successively through the hands of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, the Mughals, and the p\u00e1leg\u00e1r of Chik-ballapur.\n\n**Sidl\u00ed.**\u2014One of the Dw\u00e1rs or submontane tracts forming the Eastern Dw\u00e1rs of Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1 District, Assam.

Sidl\u00ed, like the rest of the Dw\u00e1r tract, was ceded to the British at the close of the Bh\u00fat\u00e1n war of 1864-65. In 1870, a settlement for seven years was made with the R\u00e1j\u00e1 at a land revenue of \u00a31939; but this amount was never actually collected, and the estate was forthwith, at the R\u00e1j\u00e1's request, placed under the Court of Wards, under whose management it has continued ever since. In 1877, when the first settlement expired, a change was introduced in the system of management. The tract was divided into five mauz\u00e1s or village circles, each placed under a mauz\u00e1d\u00e1r, who collects the rents direct from the cultivators, to whom annual leases are given for the land they actually cultivate, as in the Assam valley. Twenty per cent. of the net collections are made over to the R\u00e1j\u00e1 Gaurin\u00e1r\u00e1yan Deb. In 1881-82 the net receipts amounted to \u00a33531.\n\n**Sig\u00far Gh\u00e1t,** the corrected spelling for Seghur (*q.v.*).\u2014Mountain pass in the Nilgiri Hills, Madras Presidency.\n\n**Sihonda.**\u2014Ancient and decayed town in B\u00e1n\u00e1 District, North-Western Provinces; situated near the right bank of the Ken river, a short distance to the right of the B\u00e1n\u00e1-K\u00e1l\u00ednjar road; distant from B\u00e1n\u00e1 town 11 miles south.

The history of this clan is thus described in Mr. Elliott's Chronicles of Unao, pp. 58-60:\n\n'The present Purihars in Unao District inhabit the pargan\u00e1 of Sarosi, or, as it has recently become habitual to call it, Sikandarpur. According to their own traditions, they came from a place called Jigini (which is not to be found on the map), or Srinagar, i.e. Kashmir. From that high hill country they were driven\u2014we know not by what cause\u2014to inhabit the sandy plains of M\u00e1rw\u00e1r. Expelled thence, they were broken into innumerable little principalities, which found no abiding place, and have undergone continual changes, till we meet with a small portion of the clan who settled, comparatively a short time ago, in a little corner of Oudh; and even here the name of the beautiful valley from which they came ten centuries ago is still common in the mouths of men.\n\n'The story of the settling of the ancestors of the clan in Sarosi is thus told. About three hundred years ago, in the time of Hum\u00e1y\u00fan, Emperor of Delhi, a Dikhit girl from Purenda was married to the son of the Purihar R\u00e1j\u00e1, who lived at Jigini, across the Jumna. The bridegroom came with a large escort of his friends and brotherhood to celebrate the marriage, and the party on their journey passed through Sarosi. As they sat down around a well (the site of which is still shown), they asked who were the lords of the fort which stood not far off. They were told that the fort was held by Dhob\u00eds (washermen) and other S\u00fadras who owned the neighbouring country. The procession then went on to Purenda, and returning, conducted the bride to her home. Just before the Holi festival, a party, headed by Bhag\u00e9 Singh, returned, waited for the evening of that riotous feast, and then, when the guards of the fort were heavy with wine, and no danger was looked for, suddenly attacked and slaughtered them, and made themselves masters of the fort and the surrounding country.\n\n'Bhag\u00e9 Singh had four sons, and they divided the eighty-four villages he had conquered at his death. Asis and Salhu, the two eldest sons, took the largest portion of the estate\u2014twenty villages falling to the former, and forty-two to the latter. The third son, Manik, was a devotee, and refused to be troubled with worldly affairs. All he asked for was one village on the banks of the Ganges, where he might spend his life in worship, and wash away his sins three times a day in the holy stream. The youngest son, Bhuledh\u00e1n, was quite a boy at the time of his father's death, and took what share his brothers chose to give him; and they do not seem to have treated him badly.\n\n'The law of primogeniture did not exist among the family. Every son, as he grew up and married, claimed his right to a separate share of his father's inheritance; and thus the ancestral estate constantly\ndwindled as fresh slices were cut off it, till at last the whole family were a set of impoverished gentlemen, who kept up none of the dignity which had belonged to the first conquerors, Bhag\u00e9 Singh and his sons. For six generations they stagnated thus, no important event marking their history till the time of Hira Singh. The family property in his time had grown very small, and he had five sons to divide it amongst; and, to add to his misfortunes, he was accused of some crime, thrown into prison at Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d, and loaded with chains. With the chains on his legs he escaped, arrived safely at Sarosi, and lay in hiding there. His pride being thus broken, he resolved to send his third son, Kalandar Singh, to take service in the Company's army. He rose to be Subahd\u00e1r Major in the 49th Regiment of Native Infantry; and in this position, through his supposed influence with the Resident, became a very considerable man. He knew that as long as he was at hand, no chaklad\u00e1r or governor would venture to treat the Purihar zam\u00ednd\u00e1rs with injustice; but on his death they would be again at the mercy of the local authorities. He therefore collected all the members of the brotherhood who were descended from Asis, and persuaded them to mass their divided holdings nominally into one large estate, of which his nephew Ghul\u00e1b Singh should be the representative t\u00e1lukd\u00e1r; so that while in reality each small shareholder retained sole possession of his own share, they should present the appearance of a powerful and united t\u00e1luk, making Ghul\u00e1b Singh their nominal head. Thus the chaklad\u00e1rs would be afraid to touch a man who seemed to hold so large an estate, though in reality he only enjoyed a small portion of it. The brotherhood consented to this; and from 1840 till the British annexation the estate was held in the name of Ghul\u00e1b Singh alone, and they had no further trouble from the oppressions of the chaklad\u00e1rs.'\n\nSikandarpur.\u2014Town in B\u00e1nsd\u00edh tahsil, Ballia District, North-Western Provinces; situated in lat. 26\u00b0 02' 18\" N., and long. 84\u00b0 05' 45\" E., 2 miles from the right bank of the Gogr\u00e1, 14 miles from B\u00e1nsd\u00edh, and 24 miles from Ballia town. Population (1881) 7027, namely, Hindus 4349, and Muhammadans 2678. The town was founded in the 15th century, during the reign of Sikandar Lodi of Jaunpur, after whom it was named. Its former importance is attested by the ruins of a large fort, and of houses extending over a large area. Its decadence is locally ascribed to the wholesale migration of the inhabitants to Patn\u00e1, but nothing is known as to the cause or even the date of this abandonment. The local market is still famous for its atar of roses and other essences, of which there is a considerable export to Bengal. Police station, post-office, and middle-class school. For police and conservancy purposes, a small house-tax is raised, which realized \u00a386 in 1881\u201382.\n\nSikandra.\u2014Village in Agra tahsil, Agra District, North-Western\nProvinces; situated in lat. $27^\\circ 12' 59''$ N., and long. $77^\\circ 59' 34''$ E., 5 miles north-west of Agra city, on the Muttra road. Population (1881) 1745. Founded by Sikandar Lodi of Jaunpur, who built a palace here in 1495, but now chiefly noticeable as containing the tomb of Akbar, commenced by that monarch, and finished by his son Jah\u00e1ngir in 1613. Fergusson describes the mausoleum as the most characteristic of Akbar's buildings. It is quite unlike any other tomb in India erected before or since, and the design is believed by Fergusson to be borrowed from a Hindu, or, more correctly, a Buddhist model. It is surrounded by an extensive garden of 150 acres, still kept in order, and is approached on each side by archways of red sandstone, the principal gateway being of magnificent proportions.\n\n\u2018In the centre of this garden, on a raised platform, stands the tomb itself, of a pyramidal form. The lower terrace measures 320 feet each way, exclusive of the angle towers. It is 30 feet in height, and pierced by ten great arches on each face, and with a larger entrance, adorned with a mosaic of marble in the centre.\n\n\u2018On this terrace stands another far more ornate, measuring 186 feet on each side, and 14 feet 9 inches in height. A third and fourth, of similar design, and respectively 15 feet 2 inches and 14 feet 6 inches high, stand on this; all these being of red sandstone. Within and above the last is a white marble enclosure, 157 feet each way, or externally just half the length of the lowest terrace, its outer wall entirely composed of marble trellis-work of the most beautiful patterns. Inside, it is surrounded by a colonnade or cloister of the same material, in the centre of which, on a raised platform, is the tombstone of the founder a splendid piece of the most beautiful Arabesque tracery. This, however, is not the true burial-place; but the mortal remains of the great king repose under a far plainer tombstone in a vaulted chamber in the basement, 35 feet square, exactly under the simulated tomb that adorns the summit of the mausoleum.\n\n\u2018The total height of the building now is a little more than 100 feet to the top of the angle pavilions; and a central dome, 30 or 40 feet higher, which is the proportion that the base gives, seems just what is wanted to make this tomb as beautiful in outline and in proportion as it is in detail. Had it been so completed, it certainly would have ranked next to the T\u00e1j among Indian mausolea.\u2019\n\nAn asylum was established at Sikandra in 1837\u201338, for the orphans whose parents had perished in the terrible famine of that year. The orphanage is still maintained by the Church Mission Society.\n\n**Sikandra.**\u2014Village in Ph\u00falpur tahsil, Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d District, North-Western Provinces; situated in lat. $25^\\circ 35' 15''$ N., long. $82^\\circ 1' 6''$ E. Population (1881) 2005. About a mile north-west of the village is the tomb of Mahm\u00fad of Ghazn\u00ed\u2019s famous general Sayyid Sal\u00e1r Masa\u00fad, at\nwhich a fair is held every May, attended by about 50,000 Muhammadan pilgrims.\n\n**Sikandra R\u00e1o.**\u2014South-eastern tahsil of Al\u00edgarh District, North-Western Provinces; comprising the pargan\u00e1s of Sikandra and Akar\u00e1b\u00e1d, and consisting chiefly of a fertile upland plain, watered in every direction by distributaries of the Ganges Canal. Area, 342 square miles, of which 233 are cultivated. Population (1881) 175,873, namely, males 96,099, and females 79,774. Hindus, 155,890; Muhammadans, 19,616; Jains, 366; \u2018others,\u2019 1. Of the 245 villages in the tahsil, 140 contain less than five hundred inhabitants; 62 between five hundred and a thousand; 42 between one and five thousand; and 1 upwards of ten thousand inhabitants. Land revenue at the time of the last Settlement Report, \u00a33873, or including local rates and cesses levied on land, \u00a34260. In 1884 the tahsil contained 1 criminal court, with 4 police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s); strength of regular police, 74 men; rural police or village watch (chauk\u00edd\u00e1rs), 356.\n\n**Sikandra R\u00e1o.**\u2014Town and municipality in Aligarh District, North-Western Provinces, and head-quarters of Sikandra R\u00e1o tahsil; situated in lat. 27\u00b0 41' 10\" N., and long. 78\u00b0 25' 15\" E., on the Cawnpur road, 23 miles south-east of Koil. Population (1881) 10,193, namely, males 5109, and females 5084. Hindus number 5552; Muhammadans, 4606; and Jains, 35. Municipal income (1883-84), \u00a3791, of which \u00a3739 was derived from octroi; average incidence of taxation, 1s. 2\u00bdd. per head of population (12,171) within municipal limits. Sikandra R\u00e1o is a squalid, poor-looking town, on a low, badly-drained site. A great swamp spreads eastward, attaining a length of 4 miles during the rains. Founded in the 15th century by Sikandra Lodi, and afterwards given in j\u00e1gir to R\u00e1o Kh\u00e1n, an Afgh\u00e1n, from which circumstances the town derives its compound name. During the Mutiny of 1857, Ghaus Kh\u00e1n of Sikandra R\u00e1o was one of the leading rebels, and held Koil as deputy for Walid\u00e1d Kh\u00e1n of M\u00e1l\u00e1garh. Kundan Singh, a Pund\u00edr R\u00e1jput, did good service on the British side, and held the pargan\u00e1 as N\u00e1zim. Mosque dating from Akbar\u2019s time; ruined house in the town, once the residence of the Muhammadan governor. Tahsili, police station, post-office, school, dispensary.\n\n**Sikar.**\u2014Town and chiefship in the Shaikh\u00e1wati district of Jaipur State, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. Population (1881) 17,739, namely, males 9418, and females 8321. Hindus number 11,890; Muhammadans, 5117; and \u2018others,\u2019 732. Sikar chiefship is a feudatory of Jaipur, and pays a tribute of \u00a34000 a year. Estimated revenue, \u00a380,000. The town is fortified, and is distant 72 miles north-west from Jaipur city. Post-office.\n\n**Sikhar.**\u2014Town and fort in Benares District, North-Western Provinces; situated on the left bank of the Ganges, nearly opposite\nChun\u00e1r, in lat. $25^\\circ 8'$ N., and long. $82^\\circ 53'$ E. Garrisoned in 1781 by the rebellious R\u00e1j\u00e1 Ch\u00e1it Singh, but stormed by the British under Lieutenant Polhill.\n\n**Sikkim.**\u2014Native State in the Eastern Him\u00e1laya Mountains; bounded on the north and north-east by Tibet, on the south-east by Bh\u00fat\u00e1n, on the south by the British District of D\u00e1rjiling, and on the west by Nep\u00e1l. Situated between $27^\\circ 9'$ and $27^\\circ 58'$ N. lat., and between $88^\\circ 4'$ and $89^\\circ$ E. long.; covering an area of about 1550 square miles, with an estimated population of 7000. The capital is Tumlong, where the R\u00e1j\u00e1 resides during the winter and spring, usually going to his estates at Chumbi in Tibet in summer to avoid the heavy rains of Sikkim. The Tibetan name for Sikkim is Dingjing or Demojong, and for the people Deunjong Mars; the G\u00farkha name for the people of Sikkim (which has been adopted by English writers) is Lepcha; but they call themselves Rong, according to Mr. Clements Markham.\n\n**Physical Aspects.**\u2014The whole of Sikkim is situated at a considerable elevation within the Him\u00e1layan mountain-zone. Between D\u00e1rjiling and Tumlong the mountains are generally lower than those of D\u00e1rjiling itself. North of Tumlong, the passes into Tibet have been recently visited by Mr. Blanford and Mr. Edgar, and found to be of great height. The most southerly of these passes (as described by Mr. Markham, in the introduction to his *Tibet*, second edition, 1879) is that of Jeylep-la, about 50 miles beyond Tumlong, 13,000 feet above sea-level. The two next to the north are those of Guatiula and Yak-la, the latter 14,000 feet high: these, Mr. Markham says, are rarely interrupted by snow for many days, and form the easiest route into the Chumbi valley of Tibet. Farther to the north is the Cho-la Pass, 15,000 feet high, on the direct road from Tumlong to Chumbi. The Yak-la, Cho-la and Jeylep-la Passes cross the lofty spur of the Him\u00e1layas separating the Chumbi and T\u00edsta valleys. Then comes the Tankra-la Pass, 16,083 feet high, the most snowy pass in Sikkim.\n\nSikkim is drained by the river T\u00edsta, and its affluents the Lachen the Lachung, the B\u00fari Ranj\u00edt, the Moing, the Rangri, and the Rangchu. The Am-machu rises near Parijong, at the foot of the Chamalhari Peak (23,929 feet), and flows through the Chumbi valley, which is a strip of Tibetan territory separating Sikkim from Bh\u00fat\u00e1n. In this lower part of its course, the Am-machu passes into the British District of Jalp\u00e1i-guri, under the name of the Torsha. The rivers of Sikkim generally run in very deep ravines between the mountains; and the ascent from the bank, for the first thousand feet, is almost precipitous. All the rivers are very rapid. According to Dr. Hooker's measurement, the Ranj\u00edt, in a course of 23 miles, between the gh\u00e1t above the Kulhait river and that at the cane-bridge below D\u00e1rjiling, falls 987 feet; whilst\nthe Tista falls 821 feet in about 10 miles, and flows in places at the rate of 14 miles an hour.\n\nNear Mintugong are some copper mines, worked by Nepalese. Mr. Edgar (Report on a Visit to Sikkim and the Tibetan Frontier, 1874, p. 84) found that the Bhutia population are superstitiously averse to any search for metals below the earth's surface; and consequently little is known of the mineral resources of the country. Mr. Edgar, however, was of opinion that every mine is abandoned long before the vein of ore has been exhausted.\n\nThe valleys and slopes of this mountainous land are clothed with dense jungle, the vegetation in which varies, according to the elevation, from the cotton, banian, fig, and other tropical trees, which are found in the lower zones, to the fir, rhododendron, and dwarf bamboo, which appear above the level of 10,000 feet. The bamboo grows to enormous size, often attaining a diameter of 7 to 9 inches. The canes used in the construction of the well-known Himalayan cane-bridges grow principally in the bamboo jungles. The cane is found of the diameter of $1\\frac{1}{2}$ to 2 inches; and a single piece was once traced through the jungle by Colonel Gawler (Sikkim; Mountain and Jungle Warfare, 1873, p. 15) for a distance of 80 yards without finding the end.\n\nThe wild animals are the same as those found in the jungles of Darjiling. Travellers in Sikkim suffer greatly from the pipsa, and from the leeches which abound everywhere. Colonel Gawler writes of them: 'The jungles are infested with leeches, which penetrate loosely woven clothes, and deprive the wearer of a good deal of blood before he finds them out. They get far up the noses of horses, goats, etc., and cannot be removed without subjecting the poor animal to a couple of days without water, which, being afterwards offered to him, the leeches also want to drink, and may be seized. If the leeches are allowed to remain, the animals become reduced to a skeleton.'\n\nHistory.\u2014Sikkim was known to early European travellers, such as Horace della Penna and Samuel Van de Putte, under the name of Bramashon (see Markham's Tibet, p. 64); whilst Bogle called it Demojong. Local traditions assert that the ancestors of the Rajas of Sikkim originally came from the neighbourhood of Lhasa in Tibet, and settled at Gantak. About the middle of the 16th century, the head of the family was named Pencho Namgay; and to him repaired three Tibetan monks, professors of the Dupka (or 'Red Cap') sect of Buddhism, who were disgusted at the predominance of the Galukpa sect in Tibet. These Lamas, according to Mr. Edgar's Report, succeeded in converting the Lepchas of Sikkim to their own faith, and in making Pencho Namgay Raja of the land. The avatars of two of these Lamas are now the heads, respectively, of the great monasteries of Pemiongchi and Tassiding. In 1788 the Gurkhas invaded\nSikkim, in the governorship of the Morang, and only retired, in 1789, on the Tibetan Government ceding to them a piece of territory at the head of the Koti Pass. But in 1792, on a second invasion of Tibetan territory by the G\u00farkhas, an immense Chinese army advanced to the support of the Tibetans, defeated the G\u00farkhas, and dictated terms to them almost at the gates of Khatmandu.\n\nOn the breaking out of the Nep\u00e1l war in 1814, Major Latter, at the head of a British force, occupied the Morang, and formed an alliance with the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Sikkim, who gladly seized the opportunity of revenging himself on the G\u00farkhas. At the close of the war, in 1816, the R\u00e1j\u00e1 was rewarded by a considerable accession of territory, which had been ceded to the British by Nep\u00e1l, and by the usual guarantee of protection. In February 1835, the R\u00e1j\u00e1 ceded D\u00e1rjiling to the British, and received a pension of \u00a3300 per annum in acknowledgment thereof.\n\nThere was, however a standing cause of quarrel between the R\u00e1j\u00e1 and the paramount power, due to the prevalence of slavery in Sikkim: the R\u00e1j\u00e1's subjects were inveterate kidnappers, and the R\u00e1j\u00e1 himself was most anxious to obtain from the British authorities the restoration of runaway slaves. With some absurd notion of enforcing the latter demand, two gentlemen (Dr. Campbell, the Superintendent of D\u00e1rjiling, and Dr. Hooker, the famous naturalist) were seized in 1849, whilst travelling in Sikkim, and detained for six weeks. As a punishment for this outrage, the R\u00e1j\u00e1's pension was stopped, and a piece of territory, including the lower course of the Tista and the Sikkim tar\u00e1i, was annexed. The practice, however, of kidnapping Beng\u00e1li subjects of the British Crown was not discontinued; and two specially gross cases, in 1860, led to an order from Calcutta, that the Sikkim territory, north of the Ramm\u00e1n river and west of the B\u00fari Ranj\u00edt, should be occupied until restitution was made. Colonel Gawler, at the head of a British force, with the Hon. Ashley Eden as envoy, advanced into Sikkim, and proceeded to Tumlong, when the R\u00e1j\u00e1 was forced to make full restitution, and to sign another treaty, in March 1861, which secured the rights of free trade, of protection for travellers, and of road-making.\n\nSince the ratification of this treaty, relations with Sikkim have been uniformly friendly, and the country has been repeatedly explored by travellers, who have followed in the footsteps of Dr. Hooker. In 1873, the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Sikkim, accompanied by his brother and minister, Changzed Rabu (a man of great abilities and predominating influence), and other members of his family, paid a visit to the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal at D\u00e1rjiling; and in the following winter, Mr. Edgar, C.S.I., returned the R\u00e1j\u00e1's visit, as the representative of the Bengal Government, and obtained the materials for the valuable Report quoted above.\n\nPopulation, etc.\u2014The population of Sikkim was estimated by Dr. Campbell at 7000; of whom about 3000 are Lepchas, 2000 Bhutias,\nand 1000 Limbus. Eastward of the Tista, Colonel Gawler found some Tibetans. The Buddhist monks\u2014each monastery under its own head Lama\u2014form a numerous and influential section of the population. The chief villages are Tumlong (the capital) and Gantak; the chief monasteries are those of Labrong near Tumlong, Pemiongchi, and Tassiding. The head of the Labrong monastery is called the Kupgain Lama; and Mr. Edgar states that he is also the superior of Pemiongchi, and of nearly two-thirds of the monasteries of Sikkim. On the Tumlong Hill, besides the R\u00e1j\u00e1\u2019s palace, there are a number of other substantially built houses belonging to the various officials of the State. Each house is surrounded by some cultivated land, in which are generally a few clumps of bamboos or fruit-trees. During the rainy season, many of these houses are vacant, the officials being absent with the R\u00e1j\u00e1 at Chumbi in Tibet. The house of the K\u00e1zi at Gantak is described as \u2018a very ornamental building of wattle and dab, raised on stout posts.\u2019\n\nAgriculture, Land Tenures, and Revenue System.\u2014The chief cultivated crops in the valleys and in the clearings on the hills of Sikkim are wheat, buckwheat, barley, maru\u00e1, maize, and a little rice; but no more grain is grown than suffices for local consumption. Cardamoms and oil-seeds are cultivated in the low valleys in the extreme west of the State. Plantains, oranges, and other fruits are grown in the gardens. Cattle and ponies are imported from Tibet. Between Pemiongchi and the little Ranjit, there is a curious tract of level country, described by Mr. Edgar as a great even ledge, several square miles in extent, with hills rising abruptly from it on three sides, whilst on the fourth side there is a precipitous fall of many hundred feet. The soil of this plain is exceedingly rich, as it catches all the silt of the upper hills; and every inch of it is highly cultivated, chiefly with cardamoms, oil-seeds, and other valuable crops.\n\nMr. Edgar gives the following interesting account of the revenue system and land tenures:\n\n\u2018There are twelve K\u00e1zis in Sikkim, and several other officers with various names exercise jurisdiction over specific tracts of land. Each of these officers assesses the revenue payable by all the people settled on the lands within his jurisdiction, and, as far as I can make out, keeps the greater portion for himself, paying over to the R\u00e1j\u00e1 a certain fixed contribution. At the same time, he has no proprietary right in the lands, though the K\u00e1zis have at least a kind of hereditary title to their office. The K\u00e1zis and other officers exercise limited civil and criminal jurisdiction within the lands the revenue of which they collect, all important cases being referred to the R\u00e1j\u00e1, and decided by Changzed (the minister) and the Diw\u00e1ns, who are at present three in number. The cultivators have no title to the soil, and a man can settle down\nand cultivate any land he may find unoccupied without any formality whatever; and when once he has occupied the land, no one but the R\u00e1j\u00e1 can turn him out. But the R\u00e1j\u00e1 can eject him at any time; and if he should cease to occupy the land, he would not retain any lien upon it. There is a kind of tenant-right, however, under which cultivators are enabled to dispose of unexhausted improvements. Thus, as it was explained to me, a man who has terraced a piece of hillside could not sell the land, but is allowed to sell the right of using the terraces. This custom is acknowledged not to be absolutely a right, but more of the nature of an indulgence on the part of the R\u00e1j\u00e1, by whom it was allowed to grow up for the sake of convenience.\n\n'The land is not assessed, and pays no revenue. The assessment is on the revenue-payer personally. I think that in theory he is allowed the use of the R\u00e1j\u00e1's land in order that he may live and be able to render to the R\u00e1j\u00e1 the services which he is bound to perform as the R\u00e1j\u00e1's live chattel; and possibly if the system were carried to theoretical perfection, he would be bound to give over to the R\u00e1j\u00e1 all the net produce of the land\u2014that is, all the fruit of his labour beyond what might be actually necessary to support himself and his family. In practice, the subject is only bound to give a certain portion of his labour, or of the fruit of his labour, to the State; and when he does not give actual service, the amount of his property is roughly assessed, and his contribution to the State fixed accordingly; but such assessment is made without the slightest reference to the amount of land occupied by the subject. The value of his wives and children, slaves, cattle, furniture, etc., are all taken into account, but not the extent of his fields.'\n\nThe Lamas are not bound to labour for the R\u00e1j\u00e1, and they pay no dues of any kind, no matter how much land may be cultivated by themselves or their bondsmen.\n\nCommerce, etc.\u2014There are several trade routes through Sikkim, from the British District of D\u00e1rjiling into Tibet; but owing partly to the natural difficulties of the country, and partly to the jealousy of the Tibetans, these are not much used. At Rangpo-tang, on the Tista, and at other points, there are good cane-bridges, and in some places there are raft-ferries; but all roads are mere hill bridle-paths, and communication is exceedingly imperfect and difficult. The Report of the British envoy in 1861 stated that a considerable trade between Bengal and Tibet would be the almost certain result of improved communications through Sikkim; the Tibetans exporting gold, silver, ponies, musk, borax, wool, turquoises, silk, and manjit or madder, in exchange for broadcloth, bleached goods, tobacco, and pearls. In addition to this transit trade, Sikkim supplies ponies, sheep, and jungle produce to the British territory of D\u00e1rjiling, and imports therefrom some British manufactures, tobacco, etc. A registration station has\nbeen established at Ranjit. In 1876-77, the total exports from Sikkim into Darjiling were valued at \u00a380,265, of which timber alone represented \u00a370,870; the total imports were valued at \u00a314,164, chiefly indigo (\u00a36600), cattle (\u00a32322), metals (\u00a31773), piece-goods (\u00a31357), tobacco (\u00a3967). In 1883-84, the total exports from Sikkim into Bengal had fallen to \u00a32215; and the total imports from Bengal into Sikkim to \u00a31127.\n\nClimate and Medical Aspects.\u2014The ranges between Darjiling and Tumlong are lower than Darjiling itself, and generally less cool; whilst the deep narrow valleys of most of the rivers have a hot and stifling climate, notorious for its malaria and jungle-fever. The rainfall, like that of Darjiling, is very heavy. There is usually a little dulness, and perhaps rain, late in December and early in January; after which the weather remains bright and clear until May, when storms, growing more and more frequent, usher in the rainy season, which lasts till October.\n\nSikrol (Sirol).\u2014Western suburb of Benares City, containing the military cantonments, civil station, and European quarter. Lat. 25\u00b0 20' 20\" N., long. 83\u00b0 1' 20\" E. The little river Barn\u00e1 flows through the suburb, dividing it into two parts. Church, official buildings, numerous well-built bungalows, standing amid gardens and groves.\n\nSil\u00e1i.\u2014River of Bengal; rises in the Fiscal Division of L\u00e1dhurk\u00e1, M\u00e1nbh\u00fam District, and flows in a south-easterly direction into the District of Midnapur. After a tortuous course it falls into the Rupnarayan, of which it forms the chief tributary, near the point where that river touches the eastern boundary of Midnapur. The Sil\u00e1i is subject to destructive floods; it is only navigable throughout the year for a short distance in its lower reaches, which are within tidal influence. It is fed by two small streams from B\u00e1nkur\u00e1 District, on the north\u2014the Purandhar-nad\u00ed and Gopa-nad\u00ed. The other and principal feeder of the Sil\u00e1i is the Bur\u00ed-nad\u00ed, which takes its rise in the north-west of Midnapur District, and flows east into the Sil\u00e1i near N\u00e1r\u00e1jol.\n\nSil\u00e1na.\u2014Petty State in the Sor\u00e1th prant or division of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay Presidency; consisting of 1 village, with 2 shareholders or tribute-payers. Area, 4 square miles. Population (1881) 691. Estimated revenue, \u00a3300; of which \u00a310 is paid as tribute to the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda.\n\nSil\u00e1n\u00e1th.\u2014Village in Darbhangah District, Bengal; situated on the Kaml\u00e1 river, in lat. 26\u00b0 34' 30\" N., and long. 86\u00b0 9' 45\" E. Population (1872) 2520. Not returned separately in the Census Report of 1881. Noted for its fairs held in November, and again in February or March, for about 15 days, and attended by 15,000 people, chiefly from the tar\u00e1i. Grain forms the principal article of commerce; from the Nep\u00e1l Hills are brought iron-ore, hatchets, tezp\u00e1t or bay-leaves, and musk. The fair doubtless had its origin in pilgrims coming to visit a temple of\nMah\u00e1deo, which stood here; but the Kaml\u00e1 has changed its course, and washed the temple away, and now no traces of it remain.\n\n**Silang.**\u2014Mountain range and town in the Kh\u00e1si and J\u00e1intia Hills District, Assam.\u2014See Shillong.\n\n**Silch\u00e1r.**\u2014Chief town, municipality, and administrative head-quarters of the District of Cachar, Assam; situated in lat. $24^\\circ 49' 40''$ N., and long. $92^\\circ 50' 48''$ E., on the south bank of the B\u00e1rak river. Population (1881) 6567, namely, Hindus, 4807; Muhammadans, 1647; Christians, 75; and 'others,' 38. Municipal income (1881\u201382), \u00a31168, or an average of 3s. 4\u00bdd. per head of the population (6869) within municipal limits. Silch\u00e1r is also a military cantonment. In 1885, the 42nd Bengal Native Infantry was stationed here, together with 2 guns of mountain artillery. The town is also the head-quarters of a company of rifle volunteers. A handsome new church has been erected since the earthquake of 1869. The town is built on a neck of land formed by a bend in the river. The surface is swampy in some parts, but in others it rises into low sandy hillocks, locally called *til\u00e1s*. In recent years, much attention has been paid to sanitary improvements. A large trading fair or *mel\u00e1* is held annually in January, lasting for about seven days. The average attendance is estimated at 20,000 persons; the articles sold include cotton goods and ponies from Manipur. On 10th January 1869, a severe shock of earthquake was felt at Silch\u00e1r. The church and public buildings fell down, and the greater part of the *b\u00e1z\u00e1r* was laid in ruins. The surface was rent into deep fissures, and in some parts sank down as much as from 15 to 30 feet. Another severe shock occurred on the 13th October 1882, causing much damage to masonry buildings.\n\n**Silhet\u00ed.**\u2014Zam\u00ednaddr\u00ed or petty chiefship in Drug tahsil, R\u00e1ipur District, Central Provinces; 60 miles north-west of R\u00e1ipur town; comprising 28 villages, formerly part of Gandai chiefship. Area, 83 square miles. Population (1881) 4475, occupying 1369 houses; average density of population, 54 persons per square mile. The chief is a Gond. The village of Silhet\u00ed lies in lat. $21^\\circ 47'$ N., and long. $81^\\circ 9'$ E.\n\n**Sill\u00e1na.**\u2014Native State in Central India.\u2014See Sailana.\n\n**Siller** (*Selere*).\u2014River in Vizagapatam District, Madras Presidency. Flows east, then north to Umada, where it turns west, and finally southwest, and joins the Saveri at Moat, about 20 miles north-east of the junction of the latter stream with the God\u00e1vari. The Siller has a very tortuous course through mountainous country; total length, about 150 miles.\n\n**Silond\u00ed.**\u2014Town in Sihora tahsil, Jabalpur (Jubbulpore) District, Central Provinces. Population (1881) 2025, namely, Hindus, 1893; Kab\u00edrpanth\u00eds, 42; Jains, 31; Muhammadans, 49; and non-Hindu aborigines, 10.\nSilp\u00e1ta.\u2014Village in Chatg\u00e1ri Dw\u00e1r, Darrang District, Assam, at which a large fair is held annually during the Bor Bihu festival, chiefly attended by the Cachari population.\n\nSimg\u00e1.\u2014Northern tahsil or Sub-division of R\u00e1ipur District, Central Provinces. Area, 1401 square miles; number of villages, 751; houses, 95,743. Total population (1881) 275,626, namely, males 136,171, and females 139,455; average density of population, 196\u00b77 persons per square mile. Of the total area of the tahsil, 11 square miles are held revenue-free, leaving the assessed area at 1390 square miles. Of these, 770 square miles are returned as under cultivation, 541 square miles as cultivable but not under tillage, and 79 square miles as uncultivable waste. The adult agricultural population (male and female) was returned in 1881 at 127,251, or 46\u00b717 per cent. of the total population of the tahsil. Average area of cultivated and cultivable land available for each adult agriculturist, 7 acres. Total Government land revenue, including local rates and cesses levied on land, \u00a315,027, or an average of 7\u00bdd. per cultivated acre. Total rental, including cesses, paid by the cultivators, \u00a329,813, or an average of 1s. 2\u00bdd. per cultivated acre. In 1884, Simg\u00e1 tahsil contained 1 criminal and 2 civil courts, with a regular police force numbering 112 men.\n\nSimg\u00e1.\u2014Town in R\u00e1ipur District, Central Provinces, on the Seo river, and head-quarters of Simg\u00e1 tahsil; 28 miles north of R\u00e1ipur town, on the road to Bil\u00e1spur. Population (1881) 2277, namely, Hindus, 1633; Muhammadans, 326; Kab\u00edrpanth\u00eds, 131; Satn\u00e1m\u00eds, 88; Jain, 1; and non-Hindu aborigines, 98. Besides the usual Sub-divisional courts and offices, Simg\u00e1 has a town school, girls\u2019 school, police office, and post-office.\n\nSimh\u00e1chalam.\u2014Temple in Vizagapatam District, Madras Presidency.\u2014See SINHACHALAM.\n\nSimla.\u2014British District in the Lieutenant-Governorship of the Punjab, consisting of several detached plots of territory; situated among the hills of the lower Him\u00e1layan system. These plots are surrounded on all sides by the territories of independent chiefs under the control of the Deputy Commissioner of Simla, who is ex officio Superintendent of the Hill States. Area of British territory, 81 square miles. Population (1881) 42,945 souls. The administrative head-quarters are at Simla, the summer capital of the Government of India, in lat. 31\u00b0 6' N., and long. 77\u00b0 11' E.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The mountains of Simla District and the surrounding Native States compose the southern outliers of the great central chain of the Western Him\u00e1layas. They descend in a gradual series from the main chain itself in Bashahr State to the general level of the Punjab plain in Amb\u00e1la (Umballa) District, thus forming a transverse south-westerly spur between the great basins of the Ganges and the Indus, here\nrespectively represented by their tributaries the Jumna (Jamun\u00e1) and the Sutlej. A few miles north-east of Simla, the spur divides into two main ridges, one of which curves round the Sutlej valley toward the north-west, while the other, crowned by the sanatorium of Simla, trends south-eastward to a point a few miles north of Sub\u00e1thu, where it merges at right angles in the mountains of the Outer or Sub-Him\u00e1layan system, which run parallel to the principal range. South and east of Simla the hills between the Sutlej and the Tons centre in the great peak of Chor, 11,982 feet above the sea. Throughout all the hills, forests of deodar abound, while rhododendrons clothe the slopes up to the limit of perpetual snow. The scenery in the immediate neighbourhood of Simla itself presents a series of magnificent views, embracing on the south the Amb\u00e1la plains, with the Sub\u00e1thu and Kasauli Hills in the foreground, and the massive block of the Chor a little to the left; while just below the spectator's feet a series of huge ravines lead down into the deep valleys which score the mountain-sides. Northwards, the eye wanders over a network of confused chains, rising range above range, and crowned in the distance by a crescent of snowy peaks, standing out in bold relief against the clear background of the sky. The principal torrents of the surrounding tracts are the Sutlej, Pabar, the Giri Gang\u00e1, the Gambhar, and the Sarsa.\n\nExclusive of military cantonments, Simla District comprises an area of less than 81 square miles, distributed over five detached il\u00e1kas. The first of these il\u00e1kas is K\u00e1lka, a small tract about one square mile in area, acquired by gift from the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja of Pati\u00e1la as a site for a b\u00e1z\u00e1r and d\u00e9p\u00f4t at the spot where the road to Simla first enters the hills. The second il\u00e1ka is Bharauli, with which are included the isolated villages of K\u00e1la and Kalag, and a small detached group of four villages near Kasauli, known as the Shiwa Il\u00e1ka. The area of the whole is about 15,000 acres, which have remained in our possession since the close of the G\u00farkha war, when the old ruling family was found to be extinct. The main Bharauli territory consists of a narrow valley in the hollow of the hills stretching from Sub\u00e1thu to Ki\u00e1ri Gh\u00e1t, on the Simla road. The third il\u00e1ka is Simla, a small tract of less than 4000 acres, chiefly occupied by the hill station of Simla, the cultivated area being less than 200 acres. The whole il\u00e1ka was acquired in 1830 from Pati\u00e1la and Keunth\u00e1l in exchange for other land. The fourth is Kotkh\u00e1i, a small territory of about 22,000 acres, lying 20 miles east of Simla, around the sources of the Giri. It was acquired in 1828 by voluntary cession from the R\u00e1n\u00e1 Bhagw\u00e1n Singh. The fifth and last il\u00e1ka is Kot-guru, otherwise known as Kotgarh. It is another small tract of less than 11,000 acres, lying along a spur of the Hathu mountain, on the bank of the Sutlej, 22 miles north-east from Simla as the crow flies. It originally belonged to the Kotkh\u00e1i principality, was then appropriated by the\nR\u00e1j\u00e1 of K\u00falu, from whom it was forcibly taken by Bashahr, in whose possession it remained for forty years, when it was seized by the G\u00farkhas. On our invitation it was again occupied by K\u00falu troops during the G\u00farkha war of 1815, and was eventually retained by us when these hostilities were brought to a close.\n\n**History.**\u2014The acquisition of the patches of territory composing Simla District dates from the period of the G\u00farkha war in 1815\u201316. At a very early time the Hill States, together with the outer portion of K\u00e1ngra District, probably formed part of the Katoch kingdom of Jalandhar (Jullundur); and, after the disruption of that principality, they continued to be governed by petty R\u00e1j\u00e1s till the beginning of the present century. After the encroachments of the G\u00farkhas led to the British invasion of their dominions in 1815, our troops remained in possession of the whole block of hill country between the Gogra and the Sutlej. Kum\u00e1un and the Dehra D\u00fan became a portion of British territory; a few separate localities were retained as military posts, and a portion of Keunth\u00e1l State was sold to the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Pati\u00e1la. With these exceptions, however, the tract conquered in 1815 was restored to the Hill Raj\u00e1s, from whom it had been wrested by the G\u00farkhas. Garhw\u00e1l State became attached to the Lieutenant-Governorship of the North-Western Provinces; but the remaining principalities rank among the dependencies of the Punjab, and are known collectively as the Simla Hill States. From one or other of these, the plots now composing the little District of Simla have been gradually acquired. Part of the hill over which the Simla sanatorium now spreads was retained by Government in 1816, and an additional strip of land was obtained from Keunth\u00e1l in 1830. The spur known as Jutogh, 3\u00bd miles from the station, was acquired by exchange from Pati\u00e1la in 1843, as the equivalent of two villages in Barauli. Kotkh\u00e1i Kotgarh, again, fell into our hands through the abdication of its R\u00e1n\u00e1, who refused to accept charge of the petty State. The Kasauli Hill originally belonged to Bija, but was relinquished in consideration of a small annual payment. Sub\u00e1thu Hill was retained from the beginning as a military fort; and the other fragments of the District have been added at various dates.\n\n**Population.**\u2014The results of the Census of 1881 can hardly be regarded as fairly representing the actual state of the District, for with the exception of Barauli and Kotkh\u00e1i, the British territory possesses no rural population of its own. Nor do the figures show the normal number of inhabitants on the plots which compose the District, as the Census was taken in February, one of the months when Simla and Kasauli are almost empty. Nevertheless, for the sake of uniformity, the statistics may be appended for what they are worth. The enumeration extended over an area of 81 square miles, and disclosed a total population of 42,945 persons, inhabiting 263 towns and villages, and 6559\nhouses. Classified according to sex, there were\u2014males, 27,593; females, 15,352: proportion of males, 64.2 per cent. This great discrepancy between the sexes is due to the number of male immigrants connected with the sanitaria of Simla and Kasauli, who do not bring their families with them. According to religion\u2014Hindus numbered 32,428, or 75.5 per cent.; Muhammadans, 6935, or 16.1 per cent.; Sikhs, 202, or 0.5 per cent.; Jains, 23; Buddhists, 4; and Christians, 3353, or 7.8 per cent. The Br\u00e1hmans numbered 2567. Among these the S\u00e1sani grade ranks highest in popular estimation, and supplies the R\u00e1j\u00e1s and R\u00e1n\u00e1s of the Hill States with priests. Others of the Br\u00e1hmans engage in agriculture. The R\u00e1jputs numbered 1849, of whom 359 were Muhammadans; they resemble their hill brethren in K\u00e1ngra. The Kanets (9090 in number) form the characteristic tribe of Simla, and are popularly supposed to be R\u00e1jputs who have lost caste by buying wives and permitting the remarriage of widows. Kol\u00eds numbered 3795, and Cham\u00e1rs 3384. The Muhammadans, classified by race as apart from religion, included\u2014Shaikhs, 3676; Path\u00e1ns, 1420; Sayyids, 315; and Kashmir\u00eds, 215.\n\nThe Christian population included\u2014Europeans, 2898; Eurasians, 245; and natives, 210. All classes of the hill population are simple-minded, orderly people, truthful in character and submissive to authority, so that they scarcely require to be ruled.\n\nThe chief towns (or stations) are SIMLA (13,258 in February 1881), KASAULI (2807), DAGSHAI (3642), SUBATHU (2329), SOLAN, and KALKA. Of the 263 villages scattered over the Simla territory, 242 contain less than two hundred inhabitants, and 15 between two hundred and one thousand; while only 6 contain upwards of one thousand inhabitants.\n\nAgriculture, etc.\u2014The time of sowing and harvesting in the hill country depends very greatly upon the elevation. Cultivation is carried on among all the lower valleys, but even more rudely than in the similar glens of K\u00e1ngra District. The fields are artificial terraces, built up against the mountain-sides, and sown with maize, pulses, or millet for the autumn, and with wheat for the spring harvest. Poppy, hemp, turmeric, ginger, and potatoes form the principal staples raised for exportation to the plains. The last-named crop, introduced under British rule, has rapidly grown in favour, and now occupies many fresh clearings on the hill-sides in the neighbourhood of Simla. Land is measured, not by superficial extent, but by the quantity of seed which is required to sow it. Most of the cultivators till their own little plots, and rent is practically unknown. Throughout the hills, the employment of hired labour for agricultural purposes is almost unknown, the people combining together to aid one another in special undertakings, and expecting to receive similar help in return whenever they may require it. Wages for artisans and day-labourers in\n1883\u201384 ranged from 9d. to 1s. 6d. for skilled hands, and from 6d. to 9d. for coolies. Prices of food-grains ruled as follows on the 1st of January 1884:\u2014Wheat, 15 sers per rupee, or 7s. 6d. per cwt.; barley, 19 sers per rupee, or 5s. 11d. per cwt.; Indian corn, 14\u00bd sers per rupee, or 7s. 9d. per cwt.; best rice, 4\u00bd sers per rupee, or 25s. 5d. per cwt.\n\nCommerce, Communications, etc.\u2014The trade of the District centres mainly in the bazars of Simla, which forms a considerable entrep\u00f4t for the produce of the hill tracts. Rampur, on the Sutlej, has also some importance as a depot for the shawl-wool (pashm) brought in by the mountaineers of Spiti and of Chinese Tartary. Part of it is worked up on the spot into coarse shawls, of the kind now made also at Ludhi\u00e1na and Amritsar (Umritsur), and known as R\u00e1mpur chadars; but the greater part is bought up by merchants for exportation to British India. The hill paths are so steep that most of the wool is brought down on the backs of the sheep, which are then sheared, and laden with grain for the return journey. The R\u00e1mpur fair, on the 10th and 11th of November, attracts a large number of hillmen and of traders from the plains. The main roads of the Simla Hills are those which lead from K\u00e1lka to Simla, and from Simla towards R\u00e1mpur and Ch\u00edni on the Tibetan border. Only small portions of these, however, lie actually within British territory. The old road from K\u00e1lka to Simla, via Kasauli and Sub\u00e1thu, is practicable for horses, mules, ponies, or cattle, but not for wheeled conveyances. The distance by this route is 41 miles, and the journey can be performed by relays of ponies in eight hours. The new cart-road takes a more circuitous route, via Dagshai and Solan. The distance amounts to 58 miles, and two-wheeled carts traverse the whole distance in about nine or ten hours. All the heavy traffic between Simla and the plains passes by this route. Staging bungalows have been built on all the roads at frequent intervals. A line of telegraph follows the old road, with stations at K\u00e1lka, Kasauli, and Simla.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The Simla Hill States are under the superintendence of the Deputy Commissioner of Simla, subordinate to the Commissioner at Amb\u00e1la (Umballa). The total imperial revenue of the British District amounted in 1883\u201384 to \u00a315,259, of which sum the land-tax contributed \u00a31360. The other items of importance were stamps and excise. The number of civil and revenue judges in the same year was 8, and the number of magistrates 7. The regular and municipal police force numbered 280 officers and men, being at the rate of 1 man to every 153 of the population. The Simla jail contained in 1883\u201384 a total of 172 prisoners, with a daily average of 20. Including the Lawrence Military Asylum for soldiers\u2019 children, there were 1263 children receiving education in 1883\u201384, in 29 Government aided or inspected schools; besides 10 indigenous village schools, with about 120 pupils. The educational establishments include Bishop\nCotton's School, a District School, Roman Catholic Female Orphanage, Punjab Girls' School, Mayo Industrial Girls' School, and American Presbyterian Mission at Sub\u00e1thu. The Lawrence Military Asylum, established in 1852, stands upon the crest of a hill facing Kasauli, from which it is distant by road 3 miles. The only municipality is that of Simla.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate of the Simla Hills is admirably adapted to the European constitution, and the District has therefore been selected as the site of numerous sanitaria and cantonments. The average mean temperature at Simla for each month of the year over a period of ten years ending in 1881 is as follows:\u2014January, $40^\\circ 2$\u00b0 F.; February, $41^\\circ 8$\u00b0; March, $49^\\circ 2$\u00b0; April, $58^\\circ 7$\u00b0; May, $63^\\circ 5$\u00b0; June, $67^\\circ 6$\u00b0; July, $64^\\circ 3$\u00b0; August, $63^\\circ 1$\u00b0; September, $61^\\circ 3$\u00b0; October, $55^\\circ 6$\u00b0; November, $48^\\circ 7$\u00b0; December, $44^\\circ 7$\u00b0 F. Mean annual average, $54^\\circ 9$\u00b0. The average annual rainfall amounts to $70^\\circ 42$ inches, according to a calculation made in 1881 upon observations extending over twenty years, distributed as follows:\u2014January to May, $15^\\circ 96$ inches; June to September, $52^\\circ 27$ inches; October to December, $2^\\circ 19$ inches.\n\nCholera visited Simla, Kasauli, Sub\u00e1thu, and Dagshai in 1857, 1867, 1872, and 1875, though one or other station escaped in each visitation. In 1857, the death-rate among Europeans from cholera was $3^\\circ 5$ per thousand, and in 1867, $4^\\circ 2$ per thousand. The registered death-rate of Simla in 1883 was $18$ per thousand. Goitre, leprosy, and stone are reported to be prevailing endemic diseases, and syphilis is said to be very common amongst the hill people. The only disease usually contracted by Europeans is that known as hill diarrhoea, a very troublesome form of the ailment. Government maintains three charitable dispensaries\u2014at Simla, Kasauli, and Dagshai. In 1883 they gave relief to a total number of $16,185$ persons, of whom $655$ were in-patients. In 1885, a large first-class hospital, with special wards for European patients, was opened in Simla. [For further information regarding Simla, see the Report on the Land Revenue Settlement of Simla District, by Colonel E. G. Wace (Calcutta, 1884); also the Punjab Census Report for 1881; and the several annual Administration and Departmental Reports of the Punjab Government.]\n\nSimla.\u2014Tahsil of Simla District, Punjab; consisting of the two detached pargan\u00e1s of Simla and Barauli. Area, 4 square miles. Population (1881) $33,098$, namely, males $22,739$, and females $10,359$. Hindus number $22,753$; Muhammadans, $6804$; Sikhs, $200$; and 'others,' nearly all Christians, $3341$. Revenue of the tahsil, \u00a3662. The administrative staff, including the head-quarters officers, comprises a Deputy Commissioner, 2 Assistant or Extra-Assistant Commissioners, Judge of Small Cause Court, tahsild\u00e1r, and one honorary magistrate. These officers preside over 5 civil and 6 criminal courts; number of police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), 6; regular and municipal police, 124 men.\nSimla.\u2014Town, municipality, and administrative head-quarters of Simla District, Punjab; chief sanitarium and summer capital of British India. Situated on a transverse spur of the Central Himalayan system, in lat. $31^\\circ 6'$ N., and long. $77^\\circ 11'$ E. Mean elevation above sea-level, 7984 feet. Distant from Ambala (Umballa) 78 miles; from Kalka, at the foot of the hills, by cart-road, 58 miles. Population in January 1868, 7656; in July 1869, at the beginning of the season, 14,848, of whom 1434 were Europeans and 13,414 natives. In February 1881, at the time when the population of the station was at its lowest, the Census returned the population at 13,258, namely, males 9881, and females 3377. Hindus numbered 8377; Muhammadans, 3153; Sikhs, 164; Jains, 14; and 'others,' nearly all Christians, 1550. In August and September, when the season is at its height, the population considerably exceeds this number. The municipal income, which in 1875-76 was only \u00a35281, had by 1884-85 increased to \u00a320,391.\n\nA tract of land, including part of the hill now crowned by the station, was retained by the British Government at the close of the G\u00farkha war in 1815-16. Lieutenant Ross, Assistant Political Agent for the Hill States, erected the first residence, a thatched wooden cottage, in 1819. Three years afterwards, his successor, Lieutenant Kennedy, built a permanent house. Officers from Ambala and neighbouring stations quickly followed the example, and in 1826 the new settlement had acquired a name. A year later, Lord Amherst, the Governor-General, after completing his progress through the North-West, on the conclusion of the successful Bhartpur campaign, spent the summer at Simla. From that date, the sanitarium rose rapidly into favour with the European population of Northern India. Year after year, irregularly at first, but as a matter of course after a few seasons, the seat of Government was transferred for a few weeks in every summer from the heat of Calcutta to the cool climate of the Himalayas. Successive Governors-General resorted with increasing regularity to Simla during the hot weather. Situated in the recently annexed Punjab, it formed an advantageous spot for receiving the great chiefs of Northern and Western India, numbers of whom annually come to Simla to pay their respects to the British Suzerain. It also presented greater conveniences as a starting-point for the Governor-General's cold-weather tour than Calcutta, which is situated in the extreme south-east corner of Bengal. At first only a small staff of officials accompanied the Governor-General to Simla; but since the administration of Sir John Lawrence (1864), Simla has practically been the summer capital of the Government of India, with its secretariats and head-quarters establishments, unless during exceptional seasons of famine on the plains, as in 1874.\n\nUnder these circumstances, the station grew with extraordinary rapidity. From 30 houses in 1830, it increased to upwards of 100 in\n1841, and 290 in 1866. In February 1881, the number of occupied houses was 1141. At present, the bungalows extend over the whole length of a considerable ridge, which runs east and west in a crescent shape, with its concave side pointing southward. The extreme ends of the station lie at a distance of 6 miles from one another. Eastward, the ridge culminates in the peak of Jako, over 8000 feet in height, and nearly 1000 feet above the average elevation of the station. Woods of deodar, oak, and rhododendron clothe its sides, while a tolerably level road, 5 miles long, runs round its base. Another grassy height, known as Prospect Hill, of inferior elevation to Jako, and devoid of timber, closes the western extremity of the crescent. The houses cluster thickest upon the southern slopes of Jako, and of two other hills lying near the western end. The Viceregal Lodge, formerly named Peterhoff, stands upon one of the latter; while the other is crowned by a large building erected for an observatory, but now used as an ordinary residence. A new and more commodious Viceregal residence is now (1886) in course of erection on the Observatory hill, a little to the west of the present Government House. The church stands at the western base of Jako, below which, on the south side of the hill, the native baz\u0101r cuts off one end of the station from the other. The eastern portion bears the name of Chota Simla, while the most western extremity is known as Boileauganj. A beautiful northern spur, running at right angles to the main ridge, and still clothed with oak and old rhododendron trees, has acquired the complimentary designation of Elysium. Three and a half miles from the western end, a battery of artillery occupies the detached hill of Jutogh. The exquisite scenery of the neighbourhood has been described in the article on SIMLA DISTRICT.\n\nThe public institutions include the Bishop Cotton School, the Punjab Girls' School, the Mayo Industrial Girls' School, a Roman Catholic convent, a hospital, a dispensary, and a handsome Town Hall now (1886) approaching completion. The Government buildings comprise a District court-house and treasury, tahs\u012bl and police office, post-office, telegraph station, etc. Until recently, the various public offices were located in ordinary private houses, in many cases widely distant from each other. Since 1884, the offices of the Imperial Government have been concentrated in blocks of handsome buildings, centrally situated, and constructed at a cost of upwards of half a million sterling.\n\nThe commerce of the town consists mainly in the supply of necessaries to the summer visitors and their dependants; but a brisk export trade exists in opium, charas (an intoxicating preparation of hemp), fruits, nuts, and shawl-wool, collected from the neighbouring hills, or brought in from beyond the border via R\u0101mpur. Numerous European shops supply the minor wants of visitors, most of them being branches\nof Calcutta firms. The station has three English banks, a club, and several churches; and two European breweries are situated in the valley below. The great deficiency of Simla lies in its inadequate water-supply. A water-supply by means of pipes supplies Simla with water from the Mah\u00e1su range; but the constantly increasing population puts a strain upon the works which they are at times scarcely able to bear, and a further extension of the works, by the construction of additional reservoirs, is now well advanced towards completion. The springs are few in number, and several of them run dry during the summer months, when the demand for water is greatest.\n\n**Simla Hill States.**\u2014A collection of twenty-three Native States surrounding the sanitarium of Simla; bounded on the east by the high wall of the Him\u00e1layas; on the north-west by the mountains of Spiti and K\u00falu belonging to the District of K\u00e1ngra, and lower down by the Sutlej, separating them from the State of Suk\u00e9t and K\u00e1ngra proper; on the south-west by the plains of Amb\u00e1la; on the north-east by the Dehr\u00e1 D\u00fan and the Native State of Garhw\u00e1l. They extend between the parallels of lat. $30^\\circ 20'$ and $32^\\circ 5'$ N., and long. $76^\\circ 30'$ and $79^\\circ 1'$ E. They are controlled by the Superintendent of Hill States in subordination to the Commissioner of Amb\u00e1la. The table on the opposite page gives a few of the leading statistics regarding them.\n\nThe mountains of the Simla States form a continuous series of ranges ascending from the low hills which bound the plains of Amb\u00e1la to the great central chain of the Eastern Him\u00e1layas. This central chain terminates a few miles south of the Sutlej in the most northern of the States, that of Bashahr (Bass\u00e1hir). The same State is broken on its northern frontier by spurs from the snowy hills which separate it from Spiti, and on the east by similar spurs from the range by which it is shut off from Chinese Tartary. Starting from the termination of the Central Him\u00e1layas, a transverse range\u2014the last to the south of the Sutlej\u2014runs south-west throughout the length of the Simla States, forming the watershed between the Sutlej and the Jumna\u2014in other words, between the Indus and the Ganges. A few miles north-east of Simla, it divides into two main branches, one following the line of the Sutlej in a north-west direction, and the other continuing south-east, until, at a few miles north of Sub\u00e1thu, it meets at right angles the mountains of the Outer or Sub-Him\u00e1layan system, which have a direction parallel to the Central Him\u00e1layas, *i.e.* from north-east to north-west. It is upon this branch that the sanitarium of Simla lies.\n\nSouth and east of Simla, the hills lying between the Sutlej and the Tons, the principal feeder of the Jumna, centre in the great Chor mountain, 11,982 feet high, itself the termination of a minor chain that branches off southwards from the main Simla range.\n\n[Continued on page 500.]\n## Area, Population, etc., of the Simla Hill

system of these States (excluding Bashahr (Bass\u00e1hir) may be thus mapped out roughly into three portions:\u2014 (1) The Chor mountain, and spurs radiating from it, occupying the south-east corner; (2) the Simla range, extending from the central Him\u00e1layas to the neighbourhood of Sab\u00e1thu; (3) the mountains of the Sub-Him\u00e1layan series, running from north-east to north-west, and forming the boundary of the Amb\u00e1la plains.\n\nThe last-mentioned group may be sub-divided into the Sub-Him\u00e1layas proper, and an outer range, corresponding to the Siw\u00e1lik hills of Hoshi\u00e1rpur on the one side, and of the Gangetic Do\u00e1b on the other. The Sub-Him\u00e1layan and the Siw\u00e1lik ranges form parallel lines, having between them an open space of varying width. In N\u00e1han this open space is known as the Khi\u00e1rd\u00e1 D\u00fan, a broad and well-cultivated valley. The corresponding D\u00fan in N\u00e1l\u00e1garh is still more open, and is also richly cultivated.\n\nThe wilder parts of Bashahr (Bass\u00e1hir) beyond the Sutlej are thus described by Sir H. Davies:\n\n\u2018Immediately to the south of Spiti and L\u00e1hul is the district of Kun\u00e1w\u00e1r, which forms the largest sub-division of the Bashahr principality, and consists of a series of rocky and precipitous ravines, descending rapidly to the bed of the Sutlej. The district is about 70 miles long by 40 and 20 broad at its northern and southern extremities respectively. In middle Kun\u00e1w\u00e1r the cultivated spots have an average elevation of 7000 feet. The climate is genial, being beyond the influence of the periodical rains of India; and the winters are comparatively mild. Upper Kun\u00e1w\u00e1r more resembles the Alpine region of Tibet. Grain and fuel are produced abundantly; the poppy also flourishes. The Kun\u00e1w\u00e1ris are probably of Indian race, though in manners and religion they partially assimilate to the Tibetans. The people of the north are active traders, proceeding to Leh for charas, and to Gardokh for shawl-wool, giving in exchange money, clothes, and spices. The mountain paths are scarcely practicable for laden mules, and merchandise is carried chiefly on the backs of sheep and goats.\u2019\n\nThe principal rivers by which the drainage of these hills is effected are the Sutlej, the Pabar, the Giri or Giri Gang\u00e1, the Gambhar, and the Sarsa.\n\nThe Sutlej enters Bashahr State from Chinese territory by a pass between two peaks, the northern of which is 22,183 feet above sea-level, and flows south-east through Bashahr, receiving the drainage from the Central Him\u00e1layas on the one side and the Spiti hills on the other, till it reaches the border of K\u00falu, a few miles above the town of R\u00e1mpur. From this point it forms the western boundary of the Simla States, until, shortly before reaching the border of K\u00e1ngra proper, it turns southwards,\nand passes through the State of Bil\u00e1spur, which it divides into two nearly equal portions. It is crossed by bridges at Wangtu, and at Lauri below Kotgarh. In Bil\u00e1spur small boats are employed on the river; elsewhere inflated skins are used to effect a passage. The river is not fordable at any point. Its principal feeders in Bashahr are the Baspa from the south, and the Spiti from the north.\n\nThe Pabar, which is one of the principal feeders of the Tons, and therefore of the Jumna, rises in the State of Bashahr, having feeders on the southern slopes both of the Central Him\u00e1layas and the transverse Simla range. It flows southwards, and, passing into Garhw\u00e1l, there joins the Tons.\n\nThe Giri, or Giri Gang\u00e1, rises in the hills north of the Chor, and collecting the drainage of the whole tract between that mountain and the Simla range, flows south-west until, meeting the line of the Outer Him\u00e1layas, it turns sharply to the south-east, and, passing through the whole length of the State of N\u00e1han, empties itself into the Jumna about 10 miles below the junction of that river with the Tons. Its principal feeder is the Ashmi, or Assan river, which rises near Mah\u00e1su, in the Simla range, and, after receiving a considerable contribution from the eastern face of the hill upon which Simla station stands, joins the Giri just at the point where that river turns south-east.\n\nThe Gambhar rises in the Dagshai hill, and running north-east past Sub\u00e1thu, receives the Blini and several other streams, which rise in the hills to the south of Simla station, and, still continuing its course north-east, empties itself into the Sutlej about 8 miles below the town of Bil\u00e1spur.\n\nThe Sarsa collects the drainage of the D\u00fan of N\u00e1l\u00e1garh.\n\nOf these streams, the Pabar and Giri Gang\u00e1 are of considerable volume. Of the rest, except the Sarsa, all are perennial, retaining a small supply of water even in the winter months, and swelling to formidable torrents during the rainy season. The Pabar alone is fed from perennial snow.\n\nFurther information regarding the Simla Hill States will be found in the separate articles on each, in their alphabetical order.\n\n**Simr\u00e1on.**\u2014Ruined town in Champ\u00e1ran District, Bengal; situated partly in Nep\u00e1l territory, the frontier line passing through the walls. The remains of the fort are in the form of a square, surrounded by an outer wall 14 miles in circumference, and by an inner one of only 10. Inside are scattered the ruins of large buildings. The Isr\u00e1 tank measures 333 yards along one side, and 210 along the other. The portions of the palaces and temples left standing disclose some finely carved basements, with a superstructure of bricks. Twenty idols have been extricated, many, however, being much mutilated. The citadel is situated to the north, and the palace in the centre of the town; but\nboth only exist as mounds, covered with trees and jungle. Tradition says that Simr\u00e1on was founded by N\u00e1naup\u00e1 Deva in 1097 A.D. Six of his dynasty reigned with much splendour; but the last of the line, H\u00e1ri Singh Deo, was driven out in 1322 by the Muhammadans.\n\n**Simrauta.**\u2014Pargan\u00e1 in Digbijaiaganj tahsil, R\u00e1i Bareli District, Oudh; bounded on the north by Haidargarh, on the east by Inhauna, on the south by R\u00e1i Bareli, and on the west by Kumhr\u00e1wan and Hardoi. Area, 97'4 square miles, or 62,337 acres, of which 40'1 square miles, or 26,698 acres, are under cultivation. Population (1881) 52,480, namely, males 25,529, and females 26,951.

Of the 73 villages comprising the pargan\u00e1, 50 are held under t\u00e1lukd\u00e1ri, 22 under zamind\u00e1ri, and 1 under pattid\u00e1ri tenure. Kanhpuria R\u00e1jputs are the principal landed proprietors, owning 35 of the t\u00e1lukd\u00e1ri villages.\n\n**Sinawan.**\u2014Tahsil in Muzaffargarh District, Punjab.\u2014See SANAWAN.\n\n**Sinchal Pah\u00e1r.**\u2014Long undulating mountain spur in D\u00e1rjiling District, Bengal, stretching gradually down to the T\u00edsta (Teesta), from the top of which, in lat. 26\u00b0 59' N., and long. 88\u00b0 20' 5\" E., at a height of 8607 feet above the sea-level, Mount Everest is just visible. This hill is the loftiest mountain in the vicinity of D\u00e1rjiling station; its two peaks are locally known as the Bar\u00e1 and Chhot\u00e1 Durb\u00edn. Their summits are covered with grass, and their sides are clothed with forest trees, bamboos, ferns, and scrub jungle. There were formerly barracks for a European regiment on the hill, but they have been abandoned for some years in favour of the lower site at Jallapah\u00e1r.\n\n**Sinchul\u00e1.**\u2014Hill range in Jalp\u00e1igur\u00ed District, Bengal; forming the boundary between British territory and Bh\u00fat\u00e1n. Its average elevation is from 4000 to a little over 6000 feet, the highest peak, Ren\u00edgango (lat. 26\u00b0 47' 30\" N., long. 89\u00b0 37' 15\" E.), being 6222 feet above sea-level. The hills run generally in long even ridges, thickly wooded from base to summit; but at places the summits bristle up into bare crags from 200 to 300 feet. From Chhot\u00e1 Sinchul\u00e1 (5695 feet high) a magnificent view is obtained over the whole of the Bax\u00e1 Dw\u00e1r. In the distance are seen large green patches of cultivation in the midst of wide tracts of brown grass and reed jungle, the cultivated spots being dotted with homesteads; in the foreground, near the hills, are dense s\u00e1l and other tree forests, the whole being intersected by numerous rivers and streams. The Sinchul\u00e1 range can nearly everywhere be ascended by men and by beasts of burden, but not by wheeled vehicles of any description.\n\n**Sind (Scinde).**\u2014A Province of British India, forming a Commissionership under the Governor of Bombay; lying between 23\u00b0 and 28\u00b0 40' N. lat., and between 66\u00b0 50' and 71\u00b0 E. long. The Province of\nSind forms the extreme north-western portion of the Bombay Presidency, consisting of the lower valley and the delta of the Indus. It is bounded on the north by Bal\u00fachist\u00e1n, the Punjab, and Bah\u00e1walpur State; on the east by the Native States of Jaisalmer and Jodhpur in R\u00e1jput\u00e1na; on the south by the Rann of Cutch (Kachchh) and the Arabian Sea; and on the west by the territories of the Kh\u00e1n of Khel\u00e1t. The Province of Sind consists of two classes of territory\u2014(1) the five British Districts within the Province, and (2) the Native State of Khairpur. The aggregate area of the five British Districts was returned in 1881 at 48,014 square miles, or 38\u00b755 per cent. of the area of the British territory of the Bombay Presidency; the total population at 2,413,823, or only 14\u00b767 per cent. of the population of the Bombay Presidency. The Native State of Khairpur has an area of 6109 square miles, and a population (1881) of 129,153. Including Khairpur State, the Province of Sind contains an area of 54,123 square miles, and population (1881) of 2,542,976 souls. The administrative headquarters are at the city of Karachi (Kurrachee), but the ancient capital of Haidarabad still ranks among the populous towns of the Province.

W. Hughes' excellent and elaborate *Gazetteer of the Province of Sind* (London, 1876, second edition).\n\n**Physical Aspects.**\u2014Almost every portion of the great alluvial tract of Sind has at some time or other formed a channel for the river Indus itself, or one of its many branches. The main central stream of North-Western India, after collecting into its bed the waters of the five Punjab rivers, has deposited near its debouchure into the Arabian Sea a vast mass of deltaic matter, through which it flows by several shifting channels to join the sea on the southern border of the Province. In every direction, traces of ancient river beds may be discovered crossing the country like elevated dikes; for the level of the land, as in all other deltaic regions, is highest at the river bank. The Indus brings down from the turbid hill torrents a greater quantity of detritus than can be carried forward by its diminished velocity in the plain, and hence a constant accumulation of silt takes place along its various beds, raising their level above that of the surrounding country, and incidentally affording an easy opportunity of irrigation by side channels drawn from the central river.\n\nThe only elevations deserving the name of mountains occur in the Kirthar range, which separate Sind from Bal\u00fachist\u00e1n, and attain in places a height of more than 7000 feet above sea-level. They first touch the Sind frontier about the 28th parallel of north latitude, and form the British boundary for 120 miles. Thenceforward they sink considerably in altitude, forming the lesser chain of the Pab hills, which after a length of 90 miles in a southerly direction terminate on the sea-coast in the promontory of Cape Monze. Their average elevation does not rise above 2000 feet. Among the valleys and ravines of the Pab range flows the river Hab, the only permanent stream in Sind, except the Indus and its tributaries. The wild and rocky tract of KOHISTAN, in the western portion of Karach\u00ed District, forms almost the only remaining exception to the general flatness of the Province. Another offshoot of the Kirthar chain, however, known as the Lakki range, extends in a barren mass eastward into the Sehw\u00e1n Sub-division, and presents evident marks of volcanic origin in its frequent hot springs and sulphurous exhalations. A few insignificant limestone ranges intersect the Indus valley, on one of which, known as the Ganjo hills, with an elevation of only 100 feet, stands the Talpur capital of HAIDARABAD. A second small chain, running in a north-westerly direction from the neighbourhood of Jaisalmer, attains towards the Indus a height of 150 feet, and forms the rocks on which are perched the towns of ROHRI and Sukkur, as well as the island fortress of BUKKUR (Bakhar).\nThe plain country comprises a mixed tract of dry desert and alluvial plain. The finest and most productive region lies in the neighbourhood of Shik\u00e1rpur and L\u00e1rkh\u00e1na, where a long narrow island extends for 100 miles from north to south, enclosed on one side by the river Indus, and on the other by the Western N\u00e1ra. Another great alluvial tract, with an average width of 70 or 80 miles, stretches eastward from the Indus to the Eastern N\u00e1ra. The Indus appears at one time to have spread its fertilizing waters through the wide waste at present known as the Eastern Desert, in the District of Thar and P\u00e1rkar. Vestiges of ancient towns still stud the treeless expanse, and dry watercourses intersect it in every part. Sandhills abound near the eastern border, shifting under the influence of each prevailing wind. Large tracts rendered sterile for want of irrigation also occur in many other parts of Sind. Among them the most noticeable is the Pat, or desert of Shik\u00e1rpur, commencing 30 miles west of that town, and stretching to the foot of the Bol\u00e1n Pass, and formed from the clay deposited by the Bol\u00e1n, the N\u00e1ri, and other mountain torrents of the Kirthar range.\n\nThe scenery of Sind naturally lacks variety or grandeur, and its monotony renders it tame and uninteresting. Nothing can be more dreary to a stranger approaching the shore than the low and flat coast, entirely devoid of trees and shrubs. Even among the hills of Kohist\u00e1n, where fine rocky scenery abounds, the charm of foliage is almost totally wanting, owing to the volcanic nature of the rock. In the Thar and P\u00e1rkar District, in the eastern portions of Khairpur State, and in the Sub-division of Rohri, the registh\u00e1n or desert tract consists of nothing but sandhills, many of which, however, derive picturesqueness from their bold outline, and are sometimes even fairly wooded. The various ranges of sandhills succeed one another like vast waves.\n\nLakes are rare, the largest being the Manchhar in the Sehw\u00e1n Sub-division, formed by an expansion of the Western N\u00e1ra. During the inundation season it measures 20 miles in length, and covers an area of about 180 square miles. At the same period, the flood-hollows (dandhs) of the Eastern N\u00e1ra form pretty lakelets; but in spite of their great beauty they are seldom visited, as the miasma renders them dangerous places in which to encamp.\n\nThe alluvial strip which borders either bank of the Indus for a distance of 12 miles, though superior to every other part of Sind in soil and productiveness, can lay no claim to picturesque beauty. Even here, however, extensive forests of Acacia arabica (bab\u00fal) in many places skirt the reaches of the river for miles together. Near the town of Sehw\u00e1n, the Lakhi range forms an abrupt escarpment toward the river in a perpendicular face of rock 600 feet high. But the finest views in the Province are those which embrace the towns of Sukkur and Rohri, and the island fortress of Bukkur, with its lofty\ncastellated walls, lying in the river between them. All three crown\nthe range of limestone hills through which the Indus has here cut\nits way, and the minarets and houses, especially in Rohri, overhang the\nstream from a towering height above. A little to the south of Bukkur,\nagain, lies the green island of S\u00e1dh Bela with its sacred shrine, while\ngroves of date-palm and acacia stud the banks of the Indus on either\nside.\n\nThe soil of Sind consists of a plastic clay, strongly impregnated with\nsalt. When covered with the floods (d\u00fats) of the Indus, either by\nartificial irrigation or through spontaneous change of channel, it quickly\nassumes the appearance of a rich lowland; and it changes its aspect as\nquickly to that of an arid desert when the water is once more diverted\nelsewhere. The land is thus fertile enough in the immediate neigh-\nbourhood of the existing river branches to yield two or more crops\nin the year without manuring. Nevertheless, the soil contains a large\nadmixture of saltpetre; and in Southern Sind, where sand greatly\nprevails, it is so impregnated with common salt as to produce it in\nabundance by evaporation, after simply pouring water through its\nsurface.\n\nThe extent of forest land is small for a Province of so large an\narea, only about 625 square miles being covered with woodland, not\nincluding those in Khairpur State. The Forest Department has charge\nof about 90 separate forests, chiefly situated along the banks of the\nIndus, extending southward from Ghotki to the middle delta. They\nrun in narrow strips, from a quarter of a mile to 2 miles in breadth,\nand about 3 miles in length. These strips of forest are currently\nreported to have been constructed as game preserves by the M\u00edrs.\nMany of them suffer greatly at times from the encroachments of the\nstream. The floods of 1863 swept away 1000 acres of the Dh\u00e1rej\u00e1\nforest in Shik\u00e1rpur District, and a similar misfortune occurred to the\nforests of Sundarbelo and S\u00e1m\u00edtia in the two succeeding years.\n\nThe indigenous trees consist chiefly of bab\u00fal (Acacia arabica), bahan\n(Populus euphratica), kandi (Prosopis spicigera), and lai (Tamarindus\nindica). The bab\u00fal, the staple tree of Lower Sind, produces good\ntimber for boat-building and fuel; while its seed-pods supply a food\nfor fattening cattle, its bark is employed for tanning, and its leaves\nform a favourite fodder of camels and goats. The bahan, the com-\nmonest tree of Upper Sind, yields a light soft wood for building\npurposes, from which also are manufactured the celebrated lacquered\nboxes of H\u00e1la and Kh\u00e1n\u00f3t. The t\u00e1li (Dalbergia Sissoo) grows to some\nextent in Upper Sind, though it cannot be considered as indigenous to\nthe Province. The delta of the Indus contains no forests, but its\nshores and inlets abound with low thickets of mangrove trees, whose\ntimber makes a good fuel. The Forest Department has lately intro-\nduced several valuable exotics, including the tamarisk, the water-chestnut and the tallow-tree. The revenue from this source has largely increased during the last two decades. In 1883-84, the amount realized by the sale of timber of all descriptions, including firewood, was \u00a328,092. The date-palm (Phoenix sylvestris) ripens its fruit in Sind, while the country also produces excellent apples, being to some extent intermediate in its flora between Hindust\u00e1n and Khor\u00e1s\u00e1n. One-third of the indigenous vegetation is Arabian or Egyptian.\n\nThe native fauna includes the tiger, found occasionally in the jungles of Upper Sind, the hy\u00e6na, the g\u00fcrkhar or wild ass, the wolf, fox, wild hog, antelope, hog-deer, and ibex in the western hills, as well as the vulture and several falcons. The flamingo, pelican, stork, crane, and Egyptian ibis frequent the shores of the delta. Bustard, rock-grouse, quail, and partridge occur among the game-birds; while flocks of wild geese, kulang, ducks, teal, and curlew cover the lakes and dandhs during the cold season. Venomous snakes abound, and yearly cause a large number of deaths. The river fisheries of the Indus and its offshoots not only supply the Province with fresh fish, but afford a considerable export trade in dried p\u00e1la, the hils\u00e1 of Bengal. Among domestic animals, the camel of the one-humped variety ranks first as a beast of burden, immense numbers being bred in the salt marshes of the Indus. Great herds of buffaloes graze on the swampy tracts of the delta; and gh\u00ed, made from their milk, forms an important item of export trade. Sheep and goats abound in Upper Sind, on the borders of the Pat in Shik\u00e1rpur District, and in Thar and P\u00e1rkar. The horses, though small, are active, hardy, and capable of enduring great fatigue. The Bal\u00fachis of Upper Sind pay much attention to the breeding of mares. The Government have introduced English stallions; and horse-breeding is carried on for the purpose of furnishing a superior class of remounts for the cavalry, as well as improving the breed of horses in the country. The bullocks are small in size, and chiefly used for draught or for turning irrigation wheels.\n\nThe extreme south-eastern border of Sind is formed by the RANN OF CUTCH (Kachchh), an immense salt-water waste, with an area of about 9000 square miles. It bounds the District of Thar and P\u00e1rkar for a distance of nearly 40 miles. Every part of it is devoid of herbage, and a large portion is annually converted into a salt lake from June to November, owing to the influx of the sea at Lakhpat Bandar on the Kori mouth of the Indus, as well as at other places in Cutch (Kachchh) and K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r. During the remaining six months of the year, after the evaporation of the water, the surface becomes incrusted with salt, while herds of antelopes and wild asses roam over the desert expanse. According to local tradition, a well-tilled plain, irrigated by a branch of the Indus, once covered this portion of the Rann; but either the hand\nof man or an earthquake diverted the waters, and the tract has ever since remained a waste of salt. The upper part of the Kori mouth still bears the name of the Pur\u00e1na or ancient stream; and there is little doubt that the Indus once took a more easterly course than at present, and so rendered some portion of the Rann a fertile lowland.\n\nThe whole sea-coast of Sind, except the part between Kar\u00e1ch\u00ed (Kurrachee) and Cape Monze where the Pab hills approach the shore, is low and flat, and submerged at spring-tides. It consists, in fact, of a series of mud-banks deposited by the Indus, or in a few places of sandhills blown from seaward. The sea near the shore is very shallow, owing to the quantity of mud brought down by the river. A bank extends along the coast from Kar\u00e1ch\u00ed to Cutch, about 2 miles from the land, and 3 miles in width, generally dry at low water. This circumstance renders the approach to the shore extremely dangerous for large vessels.\n\nHistory.\u2014Sind owes its name as well as its existence to the river Indus or Sindhu, a Sanskrit term signifying water; though Muhammadan scholars prefer to derive the word from an eponymic patriarch Sind, the brother of Hind, and son of Nuh or Noah, whose descendants ruled over the country for many generations. Previous to the Arab invasion in 711 A.D., a Hindu dynasty appears to have reigned at Aror, near the present town of Rohri; and their capital, on the bank of the Indus, possessed many fine buildings, with extensive pleasure-gardens. The dominions of the native dynasty stretched, according to local tradition, from Kashm\u00edr and Kanauj to Surat and to Om\u00e1n, besides including the Afgh\u00e1n territories of Kandah\u00e1r and the Sul\u00e1im\u00e1n hills. The names of five kings belonging to this earliest line have been preserved to us, and their reigns are said to have extended over an aggregate of 137 years.\n\nA Br\u00e1hman chamberlain to the last of them, by name Chachh, established himself on the throne after his master's death, and left the kingdom to two of his family in succession. But during the reign of his son Dah\u00edr, a few peaceful Muhammadan merchants, as the Arab version of the conquest asserts, who had been sent into Sind by the Kh\u00e1lifa Abd\u00fal M\u00e1lik to purchase female slaves and other articles of lawful commerce, were attacked by robbers, and either made prisoners or killed on the spot. One or two of the injured merchants alone escaped to make their complaints to the Kh\u00e1lifa; and the latter readily embraced so excellent an opportunity of spreading the faith of Isl\u00e1m into the delta of the Indus. He died before the army collected for the purpose could invade Sind; but his son despatched Muhammad K\u00e1sim Sak\u00edfi to carry out the conquest about 711 A.D.\n\nMuhammad K\u00e1sim set out from Shir\u00e1z with a large force, and first captured the seaport of Debal, identified by some with Manora, and by others with Tatta. Thence he marched upon Nerankot, the\nmodern Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d; and after its capitulation he next took the strong fortress of Sehw\u00e1n. Returning to Nerankot, the Musalm\u00e1n leader proceeded to cross the Indus, whose main channel then flowed east of the city, and successfully engaged the army of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Dahir. The native prince was slain at the fort of R\u00e1war, while his family were carried away prisoners by the conqueror. In 713, Muhammad K\u00e1sim arrived at the capital, Aror, which was taken; and then advanced upon Multan (in the present Punjab Province), which submitted with an immense treasure. The end of the first great Musalm\u00e1n conqueror of India remains uncertain; but it seems probable that he was tortured to death with the sanction of Kh\u00e1lifa Sul\u00e1\u00edm\u00e1n. Sind remained thenceforward, with scarcely a break, in the hands of the Muhammadans.\n\nOn the extinction of the Ummayide dynasty of Kh\u00e1lif\u00e1s (750 A.D.), and the accession of the Ab\u00e1ssides, the Indus delta passed to the new rulers, and the power of the Musalm\u00e1ns began to attract the attention of the native princes on the northern frontier of Hindust\u00e1n. But the hold of the Kh\u00e1lif\u00e1s upon this distant Province grew slowly weaker, and became virtually extinct in 871 A.D. Two native kingdoms raised themselves at M\u00falt\u00e1n and M\u00e1nsura. The former comprised the upper valley of the united Indus as far as Aror; the latter extended from that town to the sea, and nearly coincided with the modern Province of Sind. The country was then well cultivated; and Aror, the capital, surrounded by a double wall, is said to have almost equalled M\u00falt\u00e1n in size, and to have possessed a considerable commerce. The Arab princes apparently derived but a very small revenue from Sind, and left the administration wholly in the hands of natives. Arab soldiers held lands on military tenure, and liberal grants provided for the sacred buildings and institutions of Isl\u00e1m. Commerce was carried on by caravans with Khor\u00e1s\u00e1n and Z\u00e1bulist\u00e1n, and by sea with China, Ceylon, and Malabar. The Arabs also permitted the native Sindians the free exercise of their own religion to a considerable extent.\n\nWhen Mahm\u00fad of Ghazn\u00ed invaded India in 1019, Sind was ruled by a Governor who nominally represented the Kh\u00e1lifa, K\u00e1dir Billah Ab\u00fal Abbas Ahmad. After the capture of M\u00falt\u00e1n and Uchh, Mahm\u00fad sent his Waz\u00edr, Abd\u00far Raz\u00e1\u00ed, to conquer Sind, which the Waz\u00edr accomplished in 1026. But six years later, Ibn S\u00famar, Governor of M\u00falt\u00e1n, laid the foundation of the S\u00famra dynasty in Sind, at first apparently as a titular vassal of the Ghaznevide monarchy. In 1051, however, if not before, the S\u00famra kings made themselves completely independent, and extended their possessions as far as Nasarpur, 26 miles south-east of H\u00e1l\u00e1. Under Khaf\u00edf, who made Tatta his capital, the dynasty attained its greatest power, and restrained with success the wild tribes of the western frontier. From the death of Khaf\u00edf, however, the S\u00famra dynasty lost its prestige; and in the reign of Urrah Mehl (1351), the Sama tribe, a\nbody of non-Musalm\u00e1n immigrants from Cutch (Kachchh), conspired against and killed the Musalm\u00e1n king, and placed J\u00e1m Unar, one of themselves, upon the throne of Sind.\n\nThe Samas were either Buddhists or Hindus, and had their capital city at Samanagar on the Indus, identified with the modern town of Sehw\u00e1n; but they resided chiefly at Tatta or at Samui, under the Makli Hills, 3 miles north-west of the former town. They were undoubtedly R\u00e1jputs of the Jadava stock, and they became Muham-madans not earlier than 1391 A.D. J\u00e1m Unar, first of the line, reigned three and a half years, but does not seem to have held all Sind under his sway, as the H\u00e1kims kept Bukkur and its neighbourhood on behalf of the king of the Turks. Junah, the second king, captured Bukkur, and the H\u00e1kims retreated to Uchh. Under his successor, the forces of the King of Delhi retook Bukkur, and carried the J\u00e1m and his family as prisoners to Delhi. In 1372, Firoz Tughlak invaded Sind, and compelled the ruling prince to tender a nominal allegiance. The Sama line consisted in all of 15 kings, the last of whom was supplanted by the Arghuns.\n\nThe Argh\u00fan dynasty traced its origin to Chang\u00edz Kh\u00e1n, and commenced its rule in Sind in 1521. The first prince of the line, Sh\u00e1h Beg Arghun, marching down from Kandah\u00e1r, defeated the Sama army in 1520, and sacked Tatta, the capital of J\u00e1m Firoz Sama. By a subsequent agreement, the J\u00e1m retained all Sind between Sukkur and Tatta, while the Sh\u00e1h took the region north of Lakhi. But the Samas soon after repudiated this agreement; and a battle fought at Talti, near Sehw\u00e1n, resulted in their utter defeat and the secure establishment of the Arghun power. Sh\u00e1h Beg afterwards captured the fort of Bukkur, and rebuilt the fortifications with bricks taken from the ancient stronghold of Aror. Just before his death in 1522, he made preparations to attack Gujar\u00e1t, but did not live to accomplish his purpose. Sh\u00e1h Beg was not only a bold soldier, but also a learned Musalm\u00e1n theologian and commentator. His son and successor, M\u00edrza Sh\u00e1h Husain, finally drove J\u00e1m Firoz from Tatta to Cutch, and at length to Gujar\u00e1t, where he died. Sh\u00e1h Husain severely punished his subject tribes for internal wars, and sacked the towns of M\u00falt\u00e1n and Uchh, as well as the fort of Dil\u00e1war.\n\nDuring Sh\u00e1h Husain\u2019s reign, the Mughal Emperor Hum\u00e1y\u00fan, being defeated by the Afgh\u00e1n, Sher Sh\u00e1h, in 1540 A.D., fled to Sind, where he endeavoured unsuccessfully to take the fort of Bukkur. After a short stay in Jodhpur, Hum\u00e1y\u00fan returned to Sind by way of Umarkot in 1542, and again attempted without success to conquer the country. Sh\u00e1h Husain died childless in 1554, after a reign of thirty-four years, and with him ended the Arghun dynasty. A short-lived line, the Tarkh\u00e1n, succeeded for a few years; but in 1592, the Mughal Emperor\nAkbar, who was himself born at Umarkot during the flight of his father Hum\u00e1y\u00fan, defeated M\u00edrza J\u00e1ni Beg, ruler of Tatta, and united Sind for the first time with the Musalm\u00e1n Empire of Delhi. The Province was incorporated under Akbar's organization in the Subah of M\u00falt\u00e1n.\n\nDuring the flourishing period of the Mughal Empire, the general peace of the great monarchy extended to Sind, and but few historical events of importance occurred for the next century. In the interval, however, between the consolidation of the Empire by Akbar, and the dismemberment which followed on the invasion of N\u00e1dIr Sh\u00e1h, the D\u00e1\u00fadputras or sons of D\u00e1\u00fad Kh\u00e1n, rose to distinction. Weavers and warriors by profession, they led a wild and wandering life, at Kh\u00e1npur, Tar\u00e1i, and throughout the Sukkur country. After a long and sanguinary conflict with the Mahars, a race of Hindu origin, the D\u00e1\u00fadputras succeeded in establishing their supremacy over Upper Sind, and founded the town of Shik\u00e1rpur. From the extinction of the native dynasties, Tatta had formed a scene of constant contention between neighbouring governors, till Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr put a stop to the strife by appointing removable lieutenants to administer the outlying Provinces of the Empire, and so checked the growth of a hereditary viceroyalty in Sind.\n\nTowards the end of the 17th century, however, another race, closely allied to the D\u00e1\u00fadputras, rose to power in the lower Indus valley. The Kalhoras traced their descent historically to Muhammad of Kamb\u00e1th\u00e1 (1204 A.D.), and more mythically to Abbas, the uncle of the Prophet. About 1558, the family rose into notice through the sanctity of one Adam Sh\u00e1h, the chief of a large sect of mendicants in Ch\u00e1nduka. The Governor of M\u00falt\u00e1n attacked the religious leader, dispersed his followers, and put to death Adam Sh\u00e1h himself. The Fakirs descended from the family long lived a life of warfare against the Mughal lieutenants; until at length in 1658, under N\u00e1zir Muhammad Kalhora, they began successfully to oppose the imperial troops, and to organize themselves into a regular government. At length, about 1701, Y\u00e1r Muhammad Kalhora, assisted by the Sirai or Talpur tribe, seized upon Shik\u00e1rpur, where he fixed his court, and obtained from the Emperor Aurangzeb a grant of the Deraj\u00e1t, together with a regular title (Khuda Y\u00e1r Kh\u00e1n) under the imperial system. By the year 1711, Y\u00e1r Muhammad had further overrun the Kandi\u00e1ro and L\u00e1rkh\u00e1na tracts, as well as the country around Sukkur.\n\nOn the death of Y\u00e1r Muhammad Kalhora in 1719, his son N\u00far Muhammad succeeded to his territories, and conquered the Nh\u00e1r Sub-division from the D\u00e1\u00fadputras. Sehw\u00e1n and its dependencies also fell under his rule, and his territory extended from the M\u00falt\u00e1n border to Tatta. The fort of Bukkur, however, did not come into the possession of the Kalhoras till 1736. With this exception, N\u00far Muhammad's\nauthority stretched from the desert to the Bal\u00fach\u00ed Mountains. During his reign, the Talpur tribe of Bal\u00fach\u00eds, the last native rulers of Sind, first came into notice in the person of M\u00edr Bahr\u00e1m, an able officer of the Kalhora kings. When N\u00e1dir Sh\u00e1h, the Persian conqueror, swooped upon Delhi in February 1739, and broke down the decaying Mughal organization, all the Provinces west of the Indus were detached from the Empire and incorporated with the Persian dominions. Tatta and Shik\u00e1rpur formed part of the territory thus ceded to N\u00e1dir Sh\u00e1h.\n\nShortly after his return to K\u00e1b\u00fal, N\u00e1dir set out upon a second expedition against Sind and the Punjab, in order to repress his troublesome vassal, N\u00far Muhammad. Two years earlier, the Kalhora prince had persuaded S\u00e1d\u00edk Al\u00ed, Subahd\u00e1r of Tatta, to make over that Province in return for a sum of 3 l\u00e1khs; and this transaction apparently aroused the anger of his new suzerain. On N\u00e1dir's approach, N\u00far Muhammad at first fled to Um\u00e1rkot, but afterwards surrendered with the loss of Shik\u00e1rpur and Sibi, which the Sh\u00e1h made over to the D\u00e1\u00fadputras and Afgh\u00e1ns. An annual tribute of 20 l\u00e1khs, with the honorary compensations of a high-sounding title (Sh\u00e1h Kuli Kh\u00e1n), was imposed upon the Kalhora prince.\n\nOn N\u00e1dir Sh\u00e1h's death, Sind became tributary in 1748 to Ahmad Sh\u00e1h Dur\u00e1ni of Kandah\u00e1r, who conferred on N\u00far Muhammad the new title of Sh\u00e1h Naw\u00e1z Kh\u00e1n. In 1754, the tribute being in arrears, Ahmad Sh\u00e1h advanced against Sind, and N\u00far Muhammad fled to Jaisalmer, where he died. His son, Muhammad Mur\u00e1d Y\u00e1b Kh\u00e1n, managed to appease the ruler of Kandah\u00e1r, and obtained a confirmation of his rank and power. He founded the town of Mur\u00e1d\u00e1b\u00e1d. In 1757, his subjects rose against his oppressive government and de-throned him, placing his brother, Ghul\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h, upon the throne. The new prince, after two years of internal dissension, made his own position secure; and in 1762 he invaded Cutch (Kachchh), fighting the sanguinary battle of Jhana. Next year he resumed operations against Cutch, and took the seaports of Basta and Lakhp\u00e1t on the Indus. In 1768 he founded the city of Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d on the ancient site of Nerankot, and made it his capital till his death in 1772. During the early part of his reign, in 1758, the East India Company established a factory at Tatta. Sarfar\u00e1z Kh\u00e1n, his son and successor, discouraged the Company's operations, and the factory was eventually withdrawn in 1775. Soon afterwards, the Bal\u00fach\u00eds deposed the chief, and two years of anarchy followed.\n\nIn 1777, Ghul\u00e1m Nabi Kh\u00e1n, a brother of Ghul\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h, succeeded in obtaining the throne. During his reign, M\u00edr Bijar, a Talpur chief, rose in rebellion; and in the battle between them the Kalhora prince lost his life. Abd\u00fal Nabi Kh\u00e1n, his brother, succeeded to the throne,\nand put all his relatives to death as a precautionary measure. He then made a compromise with M\u00edr Bijar, retaining the sovereignty for himself, but appointing the Talpur chief as his minister. In 1781, an army from Kandah\u00e1r invaded Sind, where the tribute remained always in a chronic state of arrears, but M\u00edr Bijar defeated it near Shik\u00e1rpur. Thereupon, Abd\u00fal Nabi Kh\u00e1n assassinated his too successful general. Abdull\u00e1 Kh\u00e1n Talpur, son of the murdered man, at once seized upon the government, and the last of the Kalhoras fled to Khel\u00e1t. Thence he made many unsuccessful efforts to regain his kingdom, and at last re-established himself for a while by the aid of Kandah\u00e1r. But on his putting to death Abdull\u00e1 Kh\u00e1n, M\u00edr Fateh Al\u00ed, a kinsman of the murdered Talpur, once more expelled him. The Kalhora king made a final effort to recover his throne; but being defeated by M\u00edr Fateh Al\u00ed, he fled to Jodhpur, where his descendants still hold distinguished rank. With him ended the dynasty of the Kalhoras.\n\nIn 1783, M\u00edr Fateh Al\u00ed Kh\u00e1n, first of the Talpur line, established himself as Rais of Sind. He obtained a firm\u00e1n from Sh\u00e1h Zam\u00e1n of Kandah\u00e1r for the government of Sind by the Talpurs. The history of Sind under its new dynasty\u2014generally spoken of as the Talpur M\u00edrs\u2014is rendered very complicated by the numerous branches into which the ruling house split up. Fateh Al\u00ed Kh\u00e1n\u2019s nephew, M\u00edr Sohr\u00e1b Kh\u00e1n, settled with his adherents at Rohri; while his son, M\u00edr Tharo Kh\u00e1n, removed to Sh\u00e1hbandar; and each of them occupied the adjacent country as an independent ruler, throwing off all allegiance to the head of their house at Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d.\n\nThe Talpurs thus fell into three distinct branches\u2014the Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d or Sh\u00e1hd\u00e1dpur family, ruling in Central Sind; the M\u00edrpur or Manik\u00e1ni house, descendants of M\u00edr Tharo, ruling at M\u00edrpur; and the Sohr\u00e1bani line, derived from M\u00edr Sohr\u00e1b, ruling at Khairpur. Further to increase the complication, Fateh Al\u00ed, head of the Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d M\u00edrs, associated with himself in the government his three younger brothers, Ghul\u00e1m Al\u00ed, Karam Al\u00ed, and Murad Ali. He then turned his attention to the recovery of Kar\u00e1chi and Umarkot. The former, alienated to the Governor of Khel\u00e1t, he recovered in 1792; the latter, held by the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Jodhpur, the M\u00edrs regained in 1813. In 1801, M\u00edr Fateh Al\u00ed died, leaving one son, Sobhd\u00e1r, and bequeathing his dominions to his three brothers. Of these, Ghul\u00e1m Al\u00ed died in 1811, and left a son, M\u00edr Muhammad; but the two surviving brothers retained the chief power in Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d. Kuram Al\u00ed died without issue in 1828; but Mur\u00e1d Al\u00ed left two sons, N\u00far Muhammad and Nas\u00edr Kh\u00e1n. Up to 1840, the government of Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d was carried on by these two M\u00edrs, together with their cousins Sobhd\u00e1r and Muhammad. M\u00edr N\u00far Muhammad died in 1841, leaving two sons, Sh\u00e1hd\u00e1d and Husain Al\u00ed. The Talpur M\u00edrs adorned Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d and its suburb Khud\u00e1b\u00e1d with\nmany handsome buildings, of which their own tombs are the most remarkable.\n\nThe first connection of the British with Sind took place as early as 1758, in the matter of the abandoned factory at Tatta. In 1799, a commercial mission was sent to Sind, to conduct business between our Government and the Talpur M\u00edrs, but it ended unsatisfactorily. The agent resided from time to time at Tatta, Sh\u00e1hbandar, or Kar\u00e1ch\u00ed, and endured numerous indignities, until at length he received a peremptory order from the M\u00edrs to quit their territory. The East India Company took no notice of this insult. In 1809, an arrangement was effected between the M\u00edrs and our authorities, mainly for the purpose of excluding Frenchmen from settling in Sind.\n\nIn 1825, the Sindi tribe of Khosas made incursions into Cutch, and a military demonstration became necessary as a preventive measure. In 1830, Lieutenant (afterwards Sir Alexander) Burnes, after many delays and threats on the part of the M\u00edrs, was permitted to follow up the course of the Indus, taking with him presents from the King of England to Ranj\u00edt Singh at Lahore. The river was then entirely unexplored, and the obvious object of the mission was the collection of information for political purposes. Two years later, Colonel Pottinger concluded a treaty with the M\u00edrs for the advancement of commerce, by which traders and merchants were permitted to use the roads and rivers of Sind, though no Englishman might settle in the country. The Khairpur M\u00edrs ratified this treaty, after their kinsmen at Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d. In 1835, Colonel Pottinger obtained leave to survey the sea-coast of Sind and the delta of the Indus; yet trade did not enter the river, and the M\u00edrs clearly mistrusted the intentions of their powerful neighbours.\n\nIn 1838, the first Afgh\u00e1n war necessitated the despatch of British troops to join the main army by way of the Indus, in spite of a clause in the treaty expressly forbidding the employment of the river as a military highway. Lord Auckland considered that so great an emergency overrode the text of the agreement, and declared that those chiefs who showed themselves unwilling to assist the British in such a crisis would be deprived of their possessions. In December of that year, a large force under Sir John Keane landed in Sind, but found itself unable to proceed, owing to the obstacles thrown in its way by the M\u00edrs in supplying stores and carriage. After a threat to march upon Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d, Sir John Keane at length succeeded in continuing his course. Owing to this hostile demeanour, a reserve force was despatched from Bombay in 1839, to take up its station in Sind. The Bal\u00fach\u00ed garrison at Manora, near Kar\u00e1ch\u00ed, endeavoured to prevent it from landing, and the British accordingly found it necessary to occupy that fort.\n\nA treaty was afterwards, in 1839, concluded with the Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d\nM\u00edrs, by which they agreed to pay 23 l\u00e1khs to Sh\u00e1h Sh\u00faja, in commutation of all arrears of tribute due to the Afgh\u00e1ns; to admit the establishment in Sind of a British force not exceeding 5000 men, the expenses being defrayed in part by the M\u00edrs themselves; and finally, to abolish all tolls upon trading boats on the Indus. The Khairpur M\u00edrs concluded a similar treaty, except as regards the subsidy. The English then took possession of the fort of Bukkur, under the terms of the engagement. By careful conciliatory measures, the British representatives secured the tranquillity of the country, so that the steam flotilla navigated the Indus unimpeded. N\u00far Mu\u1e25ammad, senior M\u00edr, died in 1841, and the Talpur Government passed to his two sons, conjointly with their uncle, Nasir Kh\u00e1n.\n\nIn 1842 Sir Charles Napier arrived in Sind, with sole authority over all the territory on the Lower Indus. New conditions were proposed to the M\u00edrs, owing to delay in payment of the tribute, these terms including the cession of Kar\u00e1ch\u00ed, Tatta, Sukkur, Bukkur, and Rohri. After some delay and a slight military demonstration, the treaty was signed in February 1843. But the Bal\u00fach\u00eds composing the S\u00edndian army did not acquiesce in this surrender of independence; and shortly afterwards they attacked the Residency, which stood near the Indus, a few miles from Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d. Major Outram and his small suite, after defending the building for a short time, found themselves compelled to retreat to a steamer then lying in the river. He soon after joined Sir C. Napier's force. On the 17th of February, Napier found the M\u00edr's army, 22,000 strong, posted on the Fuleli river, near Meeanee (Mi\u00e1ni). He gave them battle with only 2800 men of all arms, and 12 pieces of artillery, and gained a complete and brilliant victory. The Bal\u00fach\u00ed loss amounted to about 5000 men, while that of the British did not exceed 257, of whom 19 were officers. Shortly after, the chief M\u00edrs of Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d and Khairpur surrendered as prisoners of war, and the fort of Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d was captured, together with the M\u00edrs' treasure, computed at about \u00a31,000,000 sterling. In March, Napier received reinforcements from Sukkur, and went in search of the enemy, with 5000 men. He found the Bal\u00fach\u00ed army, 20,000 strong, under Sher Mu\u1e25ammad of M\u00edrpur, in a strong position near Dabo. After a desperate resistance, the S\u00edndians fled in disorder, their leader, Sher Mu\u1e25ammad, retreating to the desert. Soon afterwards, our troops occupied M\u00edrpur, Kh\u00e1s, and Um\u00e1rkot. Sind was declared a conquered country, and annexed to the British dominions.\n\nThe Talpur family thus ceased to be a ruling power, after a sovereignty of fifty-three years. The M\u00edrs were removed successively to Bombay, Poona, and Calcutta; but in 1854, Lord Dalhousie allowed them to return to Sind and take up their residence at Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d. Under the Talpurs, the government of Sind consisted of a rude\nmilitary feudalism. The M\u00edrs themselves had little education or refinement, and lived in primitive Bal\u00fach\u00ed simplicity, their extravagant propensities being shown in their fondness for horses, arms, and field sports. Their sole aim was to hoard up wealth, oppose all improvements, and enjoy themselves after their own fashion.\n\nImmediately after the annexation, Sir C. Napier was appointed the first British Governor; while a pension of $3\\frac{3}{4}$ l\u0101khs, together with lands in j\u00e1gir, was distributed amongst the deposed M\u00edrs. The judicial and revenue systems underwent a speedy remodelling; and the Province was divided into extensive Collectorates. Since the British annexation, the chief events in Sind have consisted of commercial improvements, including especially the immense harbour works at Karachi, which have rendered the modern capital one of the most important seaports of Western India. Under the Commissionership of Sir Bartle Frere (1851\u201359), the Province took most important steps in the direction of mercantile progress; and at a later date, the construction of the Indus Valley portion of the Sind, Punjab, and Delhi Railway, from Kar\u00e1ch\u00ed to join the Punjab line at M\u00falt\u00e1n, has already contributed greatly to the prosperity of the country.\n\n**Population.\u2014**Sind is a very sparsely populated Province even at the present day. No statistics are available as to the number of inhabitants under its native rulers, though a probable conjecture sets it down in the early part of this century at not more than 1,000,000 persons, or only about 16 to the square mile. A Census taken in 1856, exclusive of the territory of M\u00edr Al\u00ed Mur\u00e1d Kh\u00e1n, or Khairpur State, returned the total population at 1,772,367 persons. An accurate enumeration undertaken in 1872 gave the total, again excluding Khairpur territory, at 2,203,177; thus showing a gain of 430,810 persons, or 26 per cent., in the fifteen years. The Census of 1881 disclosed a total population of the British Districts of 2,413,823, showing a further increase of 210,646, or 9\u00b756 per cent., in the nine years between 1872 and 1881.\n\nThe main feature of this increase, which is found in every District of the Province, seems to be the influx of foreigners, chiefly from the adjacent territories of Bal\u00fach\u00edst\u00e1n and the Punjab. In Kar\u00e1ch\u00ed, as in the city of Bombay and other large seaports, the indigenous population is in the minority. A good deal of the increase in the more rural parts of the Province has been attributed to the general development of the people, under the influence of prosperous harvests and improved means of transport to market. A part of the increase, however, is only apparent, and is due to more correct enumeration, especially in the case of females. The rate of increase in the towns has been generally higher than in the surrounding country. Kar\u00e1ch\u00ed owes its prosperity to the development of its sea trade, especially since the opening of direct railway communication with Upper India and the western frontier.\nShik\u00e1pur has also profited in the same manner, and the trading centre of Sukkur has doubled its population since 1872.\n\nThe results of the Census of 1881 may be summarized as follows:\n\n\u2014Area of British Districts, 48,014 square miles. Population, 2,413,823 (males 1,316,830, and females 1,096,993); number of towns 12, and of villages 3405; number of occupied houses 433,584, and of unoccupied 149,701. From these the following averages are deduced:\n\nPersons per square mile, 50\u00b73; towns and villages per square mile, 0\u00b707; houses per square mile, 12\u00b70; persons per house, 5\u00b75. The population, which is extremely scattered in all parts of the Province, gathers thickest in Shik\u00e1pur, 85\u00b72 per square mile; and Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d, 83\u00b73 per square mile. In the Frontier District of Upper Sind, the average falls to 58. The extensive District of Kar\u00e1ch\u00ed, though it contains the capital town and largest commercial centre, has but 33\u00b79 persons to the square mile; in Khairpur State, the average is only 21\u00b71; and in the wide but desert expanse of the Thar and P\u00e1rkar District, it does not exceed 15\u00b79.\n\nClassified according to sex, the native population in 1881 amounted to\u2014males 1,314,391, and females 1,096,026. The European element was represented by 3127 persons, namely, males 2279, and females 848. Eurasians numbered 279, namely, males 160, and females 119. Classified according to sex and age, of the entire population, exclusive of Khairpur State, there were returned\u2014under 15 years, boys 546,005, and girls 441,574; total children, 987,579, or 40\u00b79 per cent.: 15 years and upwards, males 770,825, and females 655,419; total adults, 1,426,244, or 59\u00b71 per cent.\n\nReligion and Caste.\u2014Classified by religion, the Muhammadans number 1,887,204, or 78\u00b75 per cent. of the total population; Hindus, 305,079, or 12\u00b76 per cent.; Sikhs, 126,976, or 5\u00b73 per cent.; non-Hindu aborigines, 86,040, or 3\u00b75 per cent.; Christians, 6082; Jains, 1191; Pars\u00eds, 1063; Jews, 153; Brahmos, 26; and Buddhists, 9. The Muhammadans, who form the bulk of the inhabitants, fall naturally into two classes\u2014the native Sind\u00eds, and the naturalized tribes, such as Sayyids, Afgh\u00e1ns, Bal\u00fach\u00eds, Africans, and Khw\u00e1j\u00e1s. The Muhammadan population by race, as distinguished from descendants of converts, consisted of Sind\u00eds, 1,273,761; Bal\u00fach\u00eds, 409,012; Sayyids, 37,734; Shaikhs, 32,888; Path\u00e1ns, 14,729; and \u2018others,\u2019 119,080. According to sect, the Muhammadans were returned\u2014Sunn\u00eds, 1,858,648; Shi\u00e1s, 28,093; Wah\u00e1b\u00eds, 174; and \u2018others,\u2019 289.\n\nThe Sind\u00eds represent the original Hindu population, converted to Isl\u00e1m under the Ummayide Kh\u00e1l\u00edf\u00e1s. They are taller and more robust than the natives of Bengal, of dark complexion, and muscular frame. Their detractors represent them as idle, apathetic, and cowardly, addicted to drunkenness, and personally dirty; while their disinclina-\ntion to truthfulness has given them a bad name amongst neighbouring tribes. On the other hand, they are quiet and inoffensive, kindly, faithful, and of unimpeachable honesty. In religion they are Sunnis. The Sind\u00eds are sub-divided into about 300 clans or tribes, but the caste system does not exist among them. The Sind\u00ed language belongs to the pure Neo-Sanskritic group, and contains far less of alien admixture than any of the cognate tongues. It stands closer to the old Pr\u00e1krit than does either Mar\u00e1thi, Hind\u00ed, or Bengal\u00ed; and it has preserved an immense number of grammatical forms which have dropped out of the other vernaculars. Three dialects of Sind\u00ed are distinguished in Upper and Lower Sind and in the Thar, respectively. The literature of the language consists mainly of translations from the Arabic, chiefly theological, and a few rude national ballads.\n\nAmong the races of foreign origin, the Sayyids were patronized by the Kalhora princes, who granted them several considerable estates; but the Talpurs proved less liberal. The Afgh\u00e1ns came originally from Khor\u00e1s\u00e1n, and now reside in the neighbourhood of Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d and in Northern Sind. They far surpass the Sind\u00eds in personal appearance, strength, and courage. The Bal\u00fach\u00eds, wild mountaineers from the barren hills to the westward, settled in Sind under the Talpur dynasty, and received large j\u00e1girs in return for military services. They are fairer, more powerful, and hardier than the Sind\u00eds; they have genuine though peculiar ideas of honour; and they are brave soldiers, with a large share of national pride. On the other hand, they are grossly illiterate, rough in manners, drunken and debauched, violent and revengeful, and wholly addicted to coarse amusements. In religion they belong to the Sunn\u00ed sect, though the Talpur M\u00edrs, on their arrival in Sind, adopted the Shi\u00e1 persuasion. About 80 clans are settled in the plains. The Africans represent the slaves of Sind, brought over by way of Maskat from Zanzibar or Abyssinia. Emancipated at the British annexation, they still marry, as a rule, within their own race, and remain inmates of their former masters\u2019 houses. A small body of Memons gather around Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d, Sehw\u00e1n, and Kar\u00e1ch\u00ed. They are doubtless Hindus by origin, who became Musalm\u00e1ns and emigrated to Sind during the Kalhora rule. They engage in trade, agriculture, and breeding camels. Many of them possess great learning, and they have done more than any other class to introduce religious knowledge into the Province. The Khw\u00e1jas, a numerous body in Kar\u00e1ch\u00ed, are heterodox Musalm\u00e1ns, carrying the Shi\u00e1 doctrines to an extreme.\n\nThe Hindus occupy in Sind a position analogous to that of the Musalm\u00e1ns in Hindustan. Few of them, apparently, belong to native families which have survived the long Muhammadan domination; they have generally immigrated from the Punjab in recent times, and retain their distinctive names, features, and religion. The Br\u00e1hmans comprise\ntwo classes, which do not intermarry; and they are mainly confined to the large towns. One class, called amils, formed the principal clerks and writers in the time of the M\u012brs, and now of the British Government. They imitate the Muhammadans in their dress and manner of wearing the hair; and are in all a most intelligent class of the community. The lower castes are essentially similar to their brethren in the Punjab. The Sikhs reside in considerable numbers at Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d, Sehw\u00e1n, and other towns. The Census of 1881 subdivided the Hindus by caste and social distinctions into\u2014Br\u0101hmans, 13,531; R\u00e1jputs, 10,534; Loh\u00e1n\u00e1s, 211,926; and \u2018others,\u2019 69,088.\n\nAmong the Christians of the Province, 3198 were Roman Catholics, 2198 Protestants, and 686 of other Christian creeds. Adopting another principle of division, there were 3127 Europeans, 2676 native Christians, and 279 Eurasians.\n\nAs regards occupation, the Census of 1881 distributed the male population into six main groups:\u2014(1) Professional class, including civil and military officials of every kind, 19,242; (2) domestic servants, inn and lodging-house keepers, 18,926; (3) commercial class, including bankers, merchants, carriers, etc., 31,239; (4) agricultural and pastoral class, including gardeners, 476,573; (5) industrial class, including all manufacturers and artisans, 147,225; and (6) indefinite and non-productive class, comprising labourers, male children, and persons of unspecified occupation, 623,625.\n\nOf the 3417 towns and villages of Sind, 985 contain less than two hundred inhabitants; 848 between two and five hundred; 978 between five hundred and one thousand; 431 between one and two thousand; 97 between two and three thousand; 48 between three and five thousand; 22 between five and ten thousand; 3 between ten and fifteen thousand; 4 between twenty and fifty thousand; and 1 above fifty thousand.\n\nKarachi, the capital city, had a total population in 1881 of 73,560 persons; but its commercial importance is far greater than this total would seem to imply. Shikarpur, the great d\u00e9p\u00f4t of transit trade with the Bol\u00e1n Pass and Khor\u00e1s\u00e1n, had 42,496; Haidarabad, the Talpur capital, 48,153. The other chief towns and places of interest include\u2014Aror, the capital of Sind under its Hindu R\u00e1j\u00e1s; Brahmanabad, a mass of extensive ruins of very great antiquity, near Sh\u00e1hd\u00e1dpur; the fortified island of Bukkur, in the Indus; Ket\u00ed, the port on the principal mouth of the Indus (2141 persons); Khaipur, the capital of the State of the same name; Kotri, the station on the Indus Valley Railway opposite Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d (8922); Larkhana, a considerable manufacturing town (13,188); Rohri (10,224); Sehw\u00e1n (4524), the deserted port of Shahbandar; Sukkur, the great inland port of the Indus, and point of departure for the new line of rail to the Bol\u00e1n Pass (27,389); Tatta, the old emporium on the seaboard.\nJACOBABAD, the chief military station of the Frontier District (11,352); KAMBAR (6133); GARHI YASIN (5541); and MATARI (5054).\n\nAgriculture.\u2014The total extent of cultivated land in Sind in 1881-82 amounted to no more than 2,121,072 acres, by far the greater portion of the Province being absolutely barren. There are two principal harvests\u2014the rabi, sown in August, September, or October, and reaped in February, March, or April; and the kharif, sown during the floods of the Indus, in May, June, July, or August, and reaped in October, November, or December. The rabi consists of wheat, barley, gram, vetches, oil-seeds, indigo, hemp, and vegetables. The kharif includes the millets known as bajra (Pennisetum typhoideum) and joar (Sorghum vulgare), the two chief food-grains in Sind, rice, oil-seeds, pulses, and cotton. The area under each staple in 1881-82 was as follows:\u2014Joar, 493,694 acres; bajra, 474,786 acres; rice, 518,210 acres; oil-seeds, 122,464 acres; wheat, 225,946 acres; cotton, 70,178 acres; barley, 10,630 acres; indigo, 5325 acres; tobacco, 9586 acres; and sugar-cane, 2689 acres; pulses, 90,066 acres; gram, 22,039 acres; miscellaneous products, such as vegetables, fruits, etc., 75,459 acres. The distribution into harvests was as follows:\u2014Kharif, 1,652,261 acres; rabi, 381,080 acres; intermediate or mixed, 87,731 acres.\n\nThe fruits common to the country include dates, plantains, mangoes, limes, oranges, pomegranates, citrons, figs, grapes, tamarinds, mulberries, and melons. The apples of Sind are famous for their fine quality. The British have introduced apricots, peaches, and nectarines, with excellent results. The methods of cultivation still differ little, if at all, from the primitive type. Rotation of crops is unknown, and the implements belong to the coarsest patterns. Two bullocks generally draw the clumsy native plough; while a heavy log of wood, with a man perched on either end, and drawn by four bullocks, does duty for a harrow.\n\nThe dry character of the soil, and the almost complete absence of rain, render irrigation a matter of prime importance to the cultivator. Though situated on the very verge of either monsoon, the Province derives no benefit from their rainfall; for the north-western monsoon, which deluges the hills of Baluchistan, extends no farther eastward than Karachi; while the south-western monsoon terminates at Lakhpat Bandar on the boundary of Cutch (Kachchh), as regularly as though it intentionally avoided the frontiers of Sind. Sometimes, indeed, for two or three years in succession, no rain falls in the Province. Under these circumstances, the Indus almost becomes to Sind what the Nile is to Egypt. Numerous irrigation canals, drawn from the main river or its tributaries, intersect the country in every direction. These canals are carried away from the raised bed of the stream in an oblique direction, so as to secure the greatest possible fall per mile. None of them have their heads where the bank is permanent, and none are deep enough to\ndraw off water except during inundation. The river must consequently rise several feet before the canals will fill. Many of the channels are old natural beds of the side branches, now deserted; and all have the appearance rather of rivers than of artificial cuts.\n\nThe canal system is very imperfect, owing to the want of permanent head-works, and the constant accumulation of silt. Cultivation is accordingly exposed to many risks, except in those lands where irrigation is always carried on by means of water-wheels; but as this method is expensive, the poorer cultivators prefer the inferior and precarious tillage of lands which can be directly flooded from the canals, where a small deficiency of water often entirely cuts off the whole crop. From the capricious nature of the water-supply, cultivation accordingly becomes a species of lottery, the cultivator being rich one season and a bankrupt the next. Too little or too much water, an early or a late supply, may destroy his only chance of a harvest. Owing to the frequent failures, agriculture is, on the whole, a poorly paid occupation; yet the peasantry prefer the gambling risk to steady and well-paid labour.\n\nThis precarious and uncertain cultivation renders the Sind peasantry an improvident and thriftless body. They are almost always in debt to the Hindu money-lenders, who often exact as much as cent. per cent. on their advances. The population is almost wholly engaged in agriculture, yet the Province does not usually produce much more than a sufficient quantity of food-grains for its own consumption, and considerable imports take place in years of scarcity.\n\nThe land tenures of Sind belong to extremely simple types. The landowners may be divided into three classes\u2014large proprietors, a numerically small but very influential body; the holders of small estates, of a few hundred acres, answering to the middle-class gentry; and the peasant proprietors, a large body, paying revenue directly to Government, or to the alienee holding Government rights. The British authorities have upheld and fostered the rights of the smaller occupants against the encroachments of the zamindars, thus encouraging the spirit of independence amongst the cultivating classes.\n\nThe total agricultural population of the Province of Sind in 1881 was returned at 496,134, giving an average of 18\u00b72 acres of cultivable and cultivated land to each. The total agricultural population, however, dependent on the soil amounted to 1,340,239, or 55\u00b752 per cent. of the population of the Province. Total amount of Government assessment, including local rates and cesses on land, \u00a3680,022, or an average of 2s. 0\u00bdd. per cultivated acre.\n\nCommerce and Communications.\u2014The trade of Sind centres almost entirely upon the great seaport of Kar\u00e1chi, a creation of British rule, and now the chief port of entry and exit for the Punjab. The total value of the imports into Kar\u00e1chi in 1881\u201382 amounted to \u00a33,759,708;\nwhile those into the whole Province, excluding the capital, were only \u00a332,505. In the same year, the exports from Kar\u00e1ch\u00e9 amounted to \u00a33,959,333, and from the remainder of Sind to \u00a385,314. The staple articles of export are raw cotton, wool, and grain of various kinds.\n\nKar\u00e1ch\u00e9 has long formed the chief outlet for the cotton crops of Sind and the Punjab. The Province at one time actually imported the material necessary for its own petty domestic manufactures from Cutch (Kachchh) and Gujar\u00e1t, to the amount of several thousand maunds annually. About 1840, however, extensive cotton plantations sprang up in Sind itself. In 1861, exports first began; and in 1866 they had reached the total of 28,128,900 lbs. A large portion of this amount, however, came from the Punjab. The home yield at present averages from 18,000 to 20,000 bales annually; though it is calculated that the Province still contains 3,000,000 acres of uncultivated land capable of growing the plant. The remainder consists of Punjab cotton, from the Districts of M\u00falt\u00e1n, Lahore, and Amritsar; but it bears in European markets the name of 'Sind,' from its place of shipment. Since 1870, a large trade in raw cotton has sprung up with China. The total export of raw cotton in 1882 amounted to 27,802,384 lbs.\n\nThe wool of Sind forms a staple of almost equal importance; though the larger portion of the quantity exported comes, not from the Province itself, but from Firozp\u00far District in the Punjab, and from Afgh\u00e1n\u00edst\u00e1n and Bal\u00fach\u00edst\u00e1n. The supply from the latter countries is brought into the market in a dirty condition. The value of wool exported from Kar\u00e1ch\u00e9 in 1873-74 was \u00a3634,874; and in 1881-82, \u00a3739,673.\n\nQuite recently a very important and increasing trade in wheat with Europe has sprung up. The supply comes almost entirely from the Punjab. The following table shows the exports of wheat from Kar\u00e1ch\u00e9 for the twelve years ending 1883-84:\n\n| Year | Quantity | Value |\n|------|----------|-------|\n|      | Cwts.    | \u00a3     |\n| 1872-73 | 168,966 | 75,394 |\n| 1873-74 | 797,639 | 387,314 |\n| 1874-75 | 141,872 | 61,578 |\n| 1875-76 | 306,063 | 129,469 |\n| 1876-77 | 455,240 | 195,416 |\n| 1877-78 | 607,470 | 332,109 |\n| 1878-79 | 22,333  | 12,858 |\n| 1879-80 | 274,764 | 153,462 |\n| 1880-81 | 169,465 | 86,757 |\n| 1881-82 | 1,852,334 | 948,243 |\n| 1882-83 | 2,732,275 | 1,281,238 |\n| 1883-84 | 4,372,832 | 1,952,647 |\n\nNote.\u2014In 1880, through railway communication was completed between Kar\u00e1ch\u00e9 and the Punjab.\nExtensive beds of bay salt occur on the Sirganda Creek, an eastern arm of the Indus, said to be capable of supplying the consumption of the whole world for a century. The deposit is remarkably pure, and consists of large crystals. Excise restrictions long prevented it from competing with other Indian salts, but these have now been removed.\n\nThe great harbour works of Karachi are more fully described under that article. Communications are carried on by means of the Indus, by numerous excellent roads, by the Sind, Punjab, and Delhi Railway, and by the Sind-Pishin Railway. The river, the great source of wealth to the Province, is under the charge of a special Government department, the Indus Conservancy, which removes all obstructions to navigation as soon as they appear. The Sind, Punjab, and Delhi Railway runs from Kar\u00e1ch\u00ed to Delhi, a distance of 1169 miles, its main object being to facilitate the transmission of goods from Kar\u00e1ch\u00ed to Northern Sind and the Punjab, or vice versa; thus saving the long detour by sea and river between Kar\u00e1ch\u00ed and Kotri, via the Indus Delta. The Indus at Sukkur has not yet been bridged, although a railway bridge is now (1886) in course of construction. The stone work of the bridge has been finished, and its final completion only awaits the arrival of the iron work for the large span from Bukkur island to Rohri. At present, from Rohri, on the opposite bank to Sukkur, the railway proceeds into Bah\u00e1walpur State, and so joins the Punjab system at M\u00falt\u00e1n. From the Ruk Station on the Sind, Punjab, and Delhi Railway, the Sind-Pishin Railway is under construction to Quetta; about 152 miles have been finished and opened, but only 40 miles of this are in the Province of Sind. The submarine cable, laid in 1864, connects Kar\u00e1ch\u00ed with Fao in Turkish Arabia, and thence by Turkish Government telegraph with Constantinople and Western Europe. Another line runs from Kar\u00e1ch\u00ed along the Makr\u00e1n coast, and thence by submarine cable to Bushire in Persia, connecting ultimately with the Russian system, as well as with the Siemens line to Berlin and England.\n\nAdministration.\u2014Sind forms a Province under a Commissioner, subordinate to the Government of Bombay. It contains three Collectorate\u2014those of Karachi, Shikarpur, and Haidarabad; together with the two Districts of Thar and Parkar and the Upper Sind Frontier, each under a Deputy Commissioner, besides the Native State of Khaipur. The total imperial revenue of the Province in 1881-82 amounted to \u00a3809,311, of which \u00a3482,497 was derived from land revenue, and \u00a38253 from a canal maintenance rate levied upon j\u00e1g\u00edrd\u00e1rs and from miscellaneous items of irrigation revenue. The other sources of revenue were\u2014forests, \u00a340,131; excise, \u00a391,936; judicial, \u00a39167; registration, \u00a32965; stamps, \u00a338,416; postal, \u00a349,968; telegraph, \u00a312,392; licence-tax, \u00a314,846; customs, \u00a353,949; miscellaneous,\n\u00a32555; and ghi-tax levied only in Thar and P\u00e1rkar District, \u00a32236. The local revenue in the same year amounted to \u00a3131,521, arising mainly from public works and municipal funds. The land-tax ordinarily forms two-thirds of the net revenue of Sind; but remissions are constantly necessitated by droughts, floods, or bursting of embankments. In spite of these drawbacks, however, the revenue has steadily increased under British rule. The cost of clearing canals forms one of the most important items of public expenditure.\n\nThe total police force of the Province consisted in the year 1881 of 4180 officers and men; but the area includes so large an extent of desert, that any general statement of numbers per square mile would only mislead. In Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d District, where population is thickest, there is 1 policeman to every 12 square miles and to every 1019 inhabitants; in Kar\u00e1ch\u00ed District, including the capital, there is 1 policeman to every 9 square miles and to every 326 of the population; while in the desert District of Thar and P\u00e1rkar there is only 1 policeman to every 22 square miles and to every 357 inhabitants. Number of civil judges, 33; and of stipendiary magistrates, 104.\n\nEducation has made rapid and satisfactory progress in Sind since the British annexation. In 1859-60, the Province contained only 20 Government schools. The total number of Government schools in 1873-74 amounted to 213, of which 26 were for girls. The number of pupils was 12,728, of whom 8531 were Hindus and only 4139 Muhammadans. In 1883-84, the schools under the Education Department had increased to 340, with 23,273 pupils. The number of indigenous schools at either date cannot be accurately ascertained. The Musalm\u00e1n population show but little interest in education, and specially neglect that of their daughters. Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d and Sukkur each possess a normal school, and the former town has also an engineering school. Among private institutions, the European and Indo-European schools at Kar\u00e1ch\u00ed, and the missionary schools in that town and Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d, teach up to the matriculation standard of the Bombay University. The Census of 1881 returned 27,413 males and 2201 females as under instruction, besides 76,983 males and 2849 females able to read and write but not under instruction. There are four printing presses at Kar\u00e1ch\u00ed, and two at Shik\u00e1rpur.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014Owing to its prevalent aridity, and the absence of the monsoons, Sind ranks amongst the hottest and most variable climates in India. The average temperature of the summer months is 95\u00b0 F., and that of the winter months 60\u00b0. But the thermometer frequently rises in summer to 110\u00b0 and occasionally to 120\u00b0; while in winter it falls at night a few degrees below freezing-point, and ranges even in the day-time from 40\u00b0 to 80\u00b0. No other part of India has so long a continuance of excessively hot weather, owing to\nthe deficiency of rain. The climate on the sea-coast, however, is much more equable in temperature than in Upper Sind; and Kar\u00e1chi, the great centre of European population, enjoys a strong sea-breeze, which blows day and night from April to October. In Northern Sind, the extremes of temperature are strongly marked. The thermometer at Shik\u00e1rpur often sinks below freezing-point in winter, and ice forms as late as February; yet in summer, for weeks together, the readings at midnight do not fall below 100\u00b0 F. This great and prolonged heat, coupled with the exhalations arising from the stagnant pools left after the annual inundation, produces a fatal fever and ague. The natives suffer severely from its effects, and British troops have often experienced a terrible mortality. The other prevailing diseases include small-pox and cholera. The latter complaint has often appeared in epidemic form, and wrought great mischief in the country districts; but at Kar\u00e1ch\u00ed, its ravages have lately been averted by the excellent sanitary precautions taken by the British authorities. Five civil surgeons are stationed respectively at Kar\u00e1ch\u00ed, Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d, Sukkur, Shik\u00e1rpur, and Jacob\u00e1b\u00e1d, and an apothecary at Kotri. Numerous charitable dispensaries have been established in all the chief towns; total number of patients treated in 1883-84 in the several hospitals and dispensaries, 195,422, of whom 5372 were in-door patients. Vaccination has made satisfactory progress, no opposition being raised except amongst the Hindu population. In 1873-74, the Government vaccinators operated upon 105,587 persons.\n\n**Sindew\u00e1h\u00ed (Sindwai).**\u2014Town in Brahmapuri tahsil, Ch\u00e1nda District, Central Provinces; situated in lat. 20\u00b0 17' N., and long. 79\u00b0 42' E., 16 miles north of M\u00fal. Population (1881) 4569, mostly Telingas. Hindus number 3941; Muhammadans, 56; Jains, 15; and non-Hindu aborigines, 557. A fine tank 3 miles north-east of the town irrigates a wide extent of rice and sugar-cane fields. Sindew\u00e1h\u00ed manufactures cotton cloth and bangles, which are exported; and possesses some trade in raw cotton, grain, and sugar. Government school; police outpost.\n\n**Sindgi.**\u2014North-eastern Sub-division of Bij\u00e1pur District, Bombay Presidency. Area, 812 square miles. Population (1881) 72,650, namely, males 36,466, and females 36,184, occupying 14,745 houses in 141 villages. Hindus, 63,027; Muhammadans, 9289; and \u2018others,\u2019 334. Except some villages on the Bh\u00edma river, the east of Sindgi is a rough rocky plain, with frequent, and, in some cases, abrupt undulations. It is scantily cultivated, treeless, and monotonous. The portion of the Sub-division on the banks of the Bh\u00edma to the north and east is a black-soil plain, separated by long, low, step-like risings of trap. The soil is mostly formed from the wearing of the trap and laterite, with patches of grey and dark red and sometimes sand. The plain is well tilled, and, along the river banks, dotted with rich villages. In the south, the part watered by the Don river is the best cultivated portion of the Sub-\ndivision. The supply of water is scanty. Of the total area of 812 square miles, 48 square miles are occupied by alienated villages. The remainder contains 389,687 acres of Government and 78,787 acres of alienated cultivable land; 16,415 acres of uncultivable land; 44 acres of forests; and 3356 acres of village sites, roads, and rivers. In 1881-82, 275,625 acres were under actual cultivation; cereals and millets occupied 206,378 acres; pulses, 8503 acres; oil-seeds, 18,779 acres; fibres (cotton), 40,208 acres; and miscellaneous crops, 1757 acres. In 1883 the Sub-division contained 2 criminal courts; police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), 7; regular police, 46 men; village watch (chaukid\u00e1rs), 502. Land revenue (1882), \u00a318,823.\n\n**Sindgi.** \u2014 Chief village of Sindgi Sub-division, Bij\u00e1pur District, Bombay Presidency; situated 35 miles north-east of Bij\u00e1pur town. Population (1881) 3154. In December 1824, a band of insurgents led by a Br\u00e1hman, Dev\u00e1k\u00e1r Dikshit, marched on Sindgi, captured the fort, and plundered the town. In 1866 the fort was dismantled. Dispensary.\n\n**Sindhiapura.** \u2014 Petty State of Rewa K\u00e1ntha, Bombay Presidency. Area, 4 square miles. The chief is named Chauh\u00e1n Jit\u00e1b\u00e1wa. Estimated revenue, \u00a3200; of which \u00a35, 14s. is paid as tribute to the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda. Owing to the insanity of the chief, the estate has been under direct British management since 1870.\n\n**Sindhor\u00e1.** \u2014 Village in Benares tahsil, Benares District, North-Western Provinces; situated in lat. 25\u00b0 32' 13\" N., long. 82\u00b0 58' 28\" E., 16 miles north-north-west from Benares city. Population (1881) 1985, principally Br\u00e1hmans, Kandu Baniy\u00e1s, and Cham\u00e1rs. Large mart for grain and cloth; small manufacture of sugar.\n\n**Sindi.** \u2014 Town in Wardh\u00e1 tahsil, Wardh\u00e1 District, Central Provinces; situated in lat. 20\u00b0 48' N., and long. 78\u00b0 56' E., 20 miles east of Wardh\u00e1 town; and a station on the Great Indian Peninsula Railway. Population (1881) 4644, chiefly weavers and cultivators. Hindus number 3970; Muhammadans, 502; Jains, 148; and non-Hindu aborigines, 24. Manufactures\u2014coarse cotton cloth, oil, bangles, and shoes. A market is held every Thursday and Friday. Sindi has a school, a dispensary, and a storage yard for cotton near the railway station.\n\n**Sindkher (Sindkhed).** \u2014 Chief town of Sindkher pargan\u00e1, Buld\u00e1n\u00e1 District, Berar. Lat. 19\u00b0 57' N., long. 76\u00b0 10' E. Population (1881) 2695. According to one tradition, the town was founded and named about 1000 years ago by a king Sindur\u00e1ur; according to another, it takes its name from Sidha Khetak, 'village of saints,' an unbroken line of whom are said to have lived here since the foundation of the place. The pargan\u00e1 of Sindkher was granted in j\u00e1gir to the K\u00e1zi of the town about 1450 A.D.; who afterwards gave it over voluntarily to the J\u00e1duns,\nthe head and founder of whom was Lakhj\u00ed, a R\u00e1jput from Kurw\u00e1l\u00ed in North Hindust\u00e1n. Since then, Sindkher has been regarded as the chief seat of this family, who subsequently rose to much fame and power. The j\u00e1gir of the pargan\u00e1 was held by the J\u00e1duns for about 100 years, but was then restored to the K\u00e1z\u00ed of the day by Murshid Al\u00ed Kh\u00e1n, a nobleman who came to Sindkher on a commission from the Delhi Government. The half-finished fort still stands north-west of Sindkher; it is about 150 yards square. The temple of Nilkantheswar to the south-west is supposed to be the oldest structure built by Hem\u00e1r Panth; it bears an inscription, which is, however, nearly effaced, being several feet under water in the tank near the temple. Several palaces, such as the Mah\u00e1lb\u00e1gh, Mah\u00e1k\u00e1l, the Desmukh's residence, and three or four large wells built by the J\u00e1duns, attest the magnificence and prosperity of the town in their time. In one of the frequent transfers from the Niz\u00e1m to the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, Sindkher fell to Sindhia, who held it for nearly sixty years. It was restored to the Niz\u00e1m in 1803. B\u00e1ji R\u00e1o Peshw\u00e1 encamped at Sindkher for some days in 1818, when the British troops were on his track. In 1804, General Wellesley (Wellington) wrote: 'Sindkher is a nest of thieves; the situation of this country is shocking; the people are starving in hundreds, and there is no Government to afford the slightest relief.' The decline of the town was hastened by marauders, whose names\u2014Mohan Singh, Budlam Sh\u00e1h, and Gh\u00e1z\u00ed Kh\u00e1n\u2014are yet remembered with terror. Of the once extensive irrigated gardens of Sindkher, only a few fruit-trees survive.\n\n**Sindkhera.** \u2014 Town in Virdel Sub-division, Kh\u00e1ndesh District, Bombay Presidency; situated in lat. 21\u00b0 17' 30\" N., and long. 74\u00b0 50' E., 24 miles north of Dhulia.

(Thornton), on the route from Mhow to Bombay, 90 miles south-west of the former town and 274 north-east of the latter. It lies 9 miles north of the Sindwa Gh\u00e1t, a somewhat steep but much frequented mountain pass, leading from the highlands of the S\u00e1tpura range to the valley of the T\u00e1pti in Kh\u00e1ndesh. On the south side, Sindwa is a strong square fort with a front of about 265 yards, most of it built of fine cut stone and mortar. It had nine round towers, one at each angle, as well as one in the centre of each curtain. Four gateways were protected by strong mud outworks. A dry ditch of no great size runs along the north-east and south faces. The town inside the walls has a mud fort in its centre. The grand entrance on the south consists of a very strong gateway flanked by two large round\ntowers, with a commanding terrace and curtain running between. Wide ramparts surround the fort, with several guns of different sizes. One or two large reservoirs, well provided with water. Ceded to the British Government by Holkar under the treaty of Mandeswar (1818); but restored to him upon the condition of his building a bridge over the Gohi river.\n\nSinga.\u2014Mountain pass in Bashahr State, Punjab; leading across the Himalayan range, which bounds Kunaw\u00e1r to the south. Lat. 31\u00b0 15' N., long. 78\u00b0 29' E. Stated by Thornton to be open from May till the middle of August, but impracticable at other times from the depth of the snow. Elevation above sea-level, between 16,000 and 17,000 feet.\n\nSing\u00e1lil\u00e1.\u2014Hill range in D\u00e1rjiling District, Bengal.

The waters from its west flank flow into the T\u00e1mbar, and those from the east into the Great Ranjit, a feeder of the T\u00edsta. The highest peaks of the Sing\u00e1lil\u00e1 range are\u2014Phalalum, 12,042; Subargum, 10,430; and Tanglu, 10,084 feet.\n\nSingampun\u00e1ri.\u2014Village in Tirupat\u00far t\u00e1luk, Sivagang\u00e1 zamind\u00e1ri, Madura District, Madras Presidency. Population (1881) 5769, namely, Hindus, 5638; Muhammadans, 114; and Christians, 17.\n\nSing\u00e1nall\u00far.\u2014Village in Coimbatore t\u00e1luk, Coimbatore District, Madras Presidency, and a station on the south-western line of the Madras Railway; situated in lat. 12\u00b0 9' N., and long. 77\u00b0 16' 40'' E. Population (1881) 7793, occupying 1632 houses. Hindus number 7743; Muhammadans, 15; and Christians, 35. The town and fort were destroyed by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. The town has recovered under British rule, and is now a busy place.\n\nSinganmat.\u2014Principal peak in the Sankara range, Sant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s District, Bengal. Well known as a landmark to all the country round. As recently as 1867 a human sacrifice was made on the summit of this hill as a propitiatory offering by the M\u00e1l Pah\u00e1ri\u00e1s of Sankara village.\n\nSingapur (Singapuram).\u2014Town in Jaipur (Jeypore) State, Vizagapattam District, Madras Presidency; situated in lat. 19\u00b0 3' 19'' N., and long. 82\u00b0 43' 16'' E., 21 miles west of Bissem Katak on the Banjara route to N\u00e1gpur. Population (1881) 999, chiefly Uriy\u00e1s, dwelling in 229 houses.\n\nSing\u00e1rapet (Singaricotta, Tingrecotta).\u2014Pass connecting the Districts of Salem and South Arcot, Madras Presidency.\u2014See Chengama.\n\nSingaurgarh.\u2014Hill fort in Damoh District, Central Provinces; situated in lat. 23\u00b0 32' 30'' N., and long. 79\u00b0 47' E., 26 miles north-west of Jabalpur city, on a high hill commanding the narrow Sangr\u00e1mpur valley. Founded by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Bel, a Chandela R\u00e1jput, it was enlarged by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Dalpat S\u00e1, of Garha-Mandl\u00e1, who made it the seat of Government\nabout 1540. It was the scene of the defeat of R\u00e1n\u00ed Durg\u00e1vat\u00ed by Asaf Kh\u00e1n, an officer of Akbar; and the fort sustained a siege of nine months in the days of Aurangzeb. The remains of the outer circumvallation are very extensive. Of the inner fort on a high central hill, only a tower and some ruined reservoirs remain. Two smaller towers also stand on neighbouring hills.\n\nSingh\u00e1na.\u2014Town in the Shaikh\u00e1wati district of Jaipur State, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na; situated in lat. 28\u00b0 5' N., and long. 75\u00b0 44' E., 95 miles south-west of Delhi, and 80 north of Jaipur city. Population (1881) 5259, namely, Hindus, 3117; Muhammadans, 2123; and 'others,' 19. Elphinstone describes it as a handsome town built of stone, on the skirts of a hill of purplish rock, about 600 feet high. A copper mine in a rocky hill, 2 miles south-west of the town, contains ore of a poor quality, yielding from 2 to 7 per cent. of metal. There are two ores, a sulphate and a sulphuret. This mine having become less productive than formerly, has been closed since 1872. The miners used to pay to the R\u00e1j\u00e1 a duty on the produce. Post-office.\n\nSinghbh\u00fam (Sinha-bh\u00fami, 'Lion Land').\u2014British District in the Lieutenant-Governorship of Bengal, lying between 21\u00b0 59' and 22\u00b0 53' N. lat., and between 85\u00b0 2' and 86\u00b0 56' E. long. Area, 3753 square miles. Population (1881) 453,775 souls. The District forms the southeastern portion of the Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur Division. It is bounded on the north by the Districts of Loh\u00e1rdag\u00e1 and M\u00e1nbh\u00fam, on the east by Midnapur, on the south by the Tributary States of Orissa, and on the west by Loh\u00e1rdag\u00e1 and the Tributary States of Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur. The boundaries follow for the most part the crests of the hill ranges which wall in the District on every side; but owing to the fact that few of the ranges have distinctive names, it is impossible to define the boundary line more precisely. A portion of the northern boundary, 15 miles in length, is marked by the Subarnarekh\u00e1 river, which fills a gap between two hill ridges; and a still smaller part of the southern boundary coincides with the same river, which here separates Singhbh\u00fam from the Orissa State of Morbhanj. Farther west, again, the Baitarani river, rising in Keunjhar, forms 8 miles of the boundary between that State and Singhbh\u00fam District. Singhbh\u00fam District is made up of the Government estate of the Kolh\u00e1n or Ho-desam ('country of the Hos'), the Fiscal Division of Dhalbh\u00fam, and the political estates of Par\u00e1h\u00e1t, S\u00e1raikal\u00e1, and Khars\u00e1wan. The administrative head-quarters are at Chaibasa.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The central portion of Singhbh\u00fam consists of a long undulating tract of country, running east and west, and enclosed by great hill ranges. The depressions which lie between the successive ridges are terraced for rice cultivation on the system followed in the Districts of Hazaribagh and Lohardaga; and the scenery in this central strip,\nextending from the Subarnarekh\u00e1 river on the east to the Ang\u00e1rbari range to the west of Ch\u00e1ib\u00e1s\u00e1, which is the most fertile part, is like that of Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur Proper. It is fairly clear from forest, and varies in elevation above sea-level from 400 feet near the Subarnarekh\u00e1 on the east, to 750 feet around the station of Ch\u00e1ib\u00e1s\u00e1. To the south of this is an elevated plateau embracing 700 square miles of country, where the general level rises to upwards of 1300 feet, and meets the hills of Keunjhar State in Orissa. The west of the District, bordering on Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur, is a mountainous tract of vast extent, sparsely inhabited by the wildest of Kol tribes, and considered by Colonel Dalton to be the region from which that race first descended into the plains of Singhbh\u00fam.\n\nThe extreme south-west corner, bordering on G\u00e1ngpur State, is a still grander mass of mountains, rising to a height of 3500 feet, and known as \u2018Saranda of the seven hundred hills.\u2019 The population here is very scattered; and the whole of Saranda contains but a few poor hamlets nestling in deep valleys, and belonging for the most part to one of the least reclaimed tribes of Kols. From the Lay\u00e1d\u00e1 Hill range on the north-west of Singhbh\u00fam, many rocky spurs strike out into the District, of which the more prominent attain an elevation of 2900 feet.\n\nAmong other ranges and peaks, the following may be mentioned:\u2014The Chaitanpur range, in the estate of Khars\u00e1w\u00e1n, reaches an elevation of 2529 feet. The K\u00e1parg\u00e1di range, a conspicuous ridge, rises abruptly from the plain; its highest peak is 1398 feet above the sea, and from that point the range runs south-east till it culminates in Tuilli-g\u00e1rh Hill (2492 feet). Thence the ridge gradually widens out, till it forms the northern limit of the Megh\u00e1sani range in the Orissa State of Morbhanj. On the south-west of the District, a series of hills without any general name rise to a height of 3500 feet, and entirely occupy the tract referred to above as \u2018Saranda of the seven hundred hills.\u2019 A conspicuous spur of this mass of hills stretches out towards Ch\u00e1ib\u00e1s\u00e1, and culminates in the peak of Ang\u00e1rbari, 2137 feet high.\n\nThe Singhbh\u00fam hills present in appearance a broken outline of sharp-backed ridges and conical peaks. For the most part they are covered with thick forest, except on the borders of the central fertile plateau, where many of the lower slopes have been cleared for the purpose of cultivation.\n\nThe principal rivers of the District are the Subarnarekh\u00e1 (chief affluents, the Karkai and Sanjai), which drains the eastern portion of the District bordering on Midnapur; and the Ko\u00e9l, with its affluents the North and South Karo and the Koina, which receives the drainage of the western part of the District, and of the mountainous region of Saranda. The beds of all the rivers are rocky, and\nbarriers to navigation exist in many parts of their courses. The banks are steep and covered with jungle, and no system of river-bank cultivation is known in the District.\n\nThere are no canals or lakes in Singhbhum; and the only form of artificial irrigation is the construction of embanked reservoirs across the upper ends of the natural depressions in which rice is grown. Water is thus stored, and is let out upon the crop by channels cut through or round the embankment.\n\nMinerals.\u2014Iron in a nodular form is obtained in most of the hill ranges. The nodules are small, of a dull red colour, and show a glossy surface if subjected to friction. Ore also occurs in the form of a black earth, which is rich in metal, and is usually found in stratified masses, which have to be dug out and broken in pieces before smelting. The furnaces used are built of mud in a cylindrical form, and are about three feet high. They are charged from the top with alternate layers of ore and charcoal; and, after smelting, the iron is raked out from the bottom of the furnace. The blast is obtained from two cup-shaped bellows, which are worked alternately with the feet. Gold is found in minute quantities in the sands of the rivers in the form of spangles. Copper was formerly obtained from the foot of a range of hills in Dh\u00e1lbh\u00fam; old workings, ascribed to the Jains, are found, extending over many miles, and the operations appear to have been thoroughly exhaustive. Subsequent attempts made to work the mines by European methods have proved unremunerative. Nodular limestone (kankar or gh\u00fatin) occurs all over the District, but not in sufficient quantities to be useful for road-making. Slate and coloured earths are found to the south-west of Ch\u00e1ib\u00e1s\u00e1. Soapstone occurs in several places, and is manufactured into cups and platters.\n\nForests, Jungle Products, etc.\u2014About two-thirds of Singhbhum District are covered with primeval forest, the principal trees being s\u00e1l (Shorea robusta), \u00e1san (Terminalia tomentosa), gamh\u00e1r (Gmelina arborea), kusam (Schleichera trijuga), t\u00edn (Cedrela Toona), pi\u00e1s\u00e1l (Pterocarpus Marsupium), sisu (Dalbergia Sissoo), kend (Diospyros melanoxylon), and j\u00e1mun (Eugenia jambolana). Of these, the s\u00e1l is the most valuable, for the hardness of its timber and the size of the beams which the larger specimens yield. The pi\u00e1s\u00e1l is a handsome wood, but, unless well varnished, gives out a yellow stain when wetted. No teak is met with, and no rattans. Jungle products of various kinds abound; but, owing to the isolated position of the District, they command only a nominal value, and yield no revenue. The chief articles of jungle produce are lac, beeswax, chob, or the bark of certain creepers twisted into rope; b\u00e1bui grass, which is also made into rope; and a variety of leaves and roots, which are used for food.\n\nThe forests give shelter to tigers, leopards, bears, bison, and several\nkinds of deer; and small herds of elephants occasionally wander across the boundary from the Megh\u00e1sani Hills in Morbh\u00e1nj. Wild ducks, pigeons, geese, snipe, partridge, and quail are found in the low-lying lands. The pangolin or scaly ant-eater is one of the curiosities of the District. Snakes of all kinds abound.\n\n**History.**\u2014The following section of this article is condensed from Colonel Dalton\u2019s valuable *Ethnology of Bengal*, the portions used being quoted in full in Hunter\u2019s *Statistical Account of Bengal*, vol. xvii. pp. 107\u2013114. The Singhbh\u00fam R\u00e1jp\u00fat chiefs have been known to the officers of the British Government since 1803, in which year the Marquis of Wellesley, Governor-General, caused friendly communications to be addressed to the ancestor of the present R\u00e1j\u00e1 of S\u00e1raikal\u00e1 (whose territory adjoined the Jungle Mah\u00e1ls, then under the East India Company), regarding the assistance which he promised to render in the prosecution of the war against R\u00e1ghuj\u00ed Bhonsla of N\u00e1gpur. There does not appear to have been any intercouse between British officials and the people of the Kolh\u00e1n previous to the year 1819. Of the interior of their country, for years after the acquisition of the surrounding Districts, nothing whatever was known. The Hos or Larka Kols would allow no strangers to settle in, or even pass through, the Kolh\u00e1n; and pilgrims to Jagann\u00e1th had to make a circuit of several days\u2019 journey to avoid it. In 1819, the Assistant Political Agent was directed to proceed to Par\u00e1h\u00e1t, to negotiate a settlement with its chief; but he did not succeed in penetrating so far into their country, owing to the fears entertained by the people of the savage character of the aboriginal Kols. The Political Officer writes\u2014\u2018The R\u00e1j\u00e1 and the zam\u00edn\u00e9d\u00e1rs of Singhbh\u00fam, who are in attendance on me, have so formidable an opinion of the power and ferocity of these savages, that, notwithstanding the considerable force under my command, they are evidently much alarmed, and have made a formal protest against the dangers of the march.\u2019\n\nIn 1820, the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Par\u00e1h\u00e1t acknowledged himself a feudatory of the British Government, and agreed to pay a small tribute. At this time, the R\u00e1j\u00e1 and zam\u00edn\u00e9d\u00e1rs of Singhbh\u00fam were pressing on the Political Agent, Major Roughsedge, their claims to supremacy in the Kolh\u00e1n, asserting that the Kols were their subjects in rebellion, and urging on Government to force them to return to their allegiance. The Kols denied that they were subject to the chiefs. Until they quarrelled they regarded them, they said, as friends and allies, not as rulers; and if they had at any time been their subjects, they had achieved their liberty in various hard-fought fields, and were entitled to their independence. The chiefs admitted that for more than fifty years they had been unable to exercise any control over them; and Major Roughsedge refers to three formidable but abortive attempts made (the\nlast in 1800) to subjugate them. After these attacks on their independence, it appears that the Larkas retaliated on all the bordering States, committing great ravages and depopulating entire villages.\n\nIn 1820, Major Roughsedge entered their country with a force of artillery, cavalry, and infantry, with the avowed object of compelling the Kols to submit to the R\u00e1j\u00e1s who claimed their allegiance. He did his best to conciliate them, and was at first in hopes that he had succeeded. He was allowed to advance unmolested into the heart of their territory; but while encamped at Ch\u00e1ib\u00e1s\u00e1 on the Roro river, near the present station of the same name, an attack was made within sight of the camp by a body of Larkas, who killed one man and wounded several others with their battle-axes. They then moved away towards the hills; but their retreat was cut off by Lieutenant Maitland, who in several encounters dispersed them with great loss. The whole of the northern p\u00edrs or communities entered into engagements to pay tribute to the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Singhbh\u00fam. But in leaving the country, Major Roughsedge had to encounter the still fiercer Kols of the southern p\u00edrs; and after fighting every inch of his way out of Singhbh\u00fam, he left them unsubdued. Immediately afterwards, a war broke out between the Larkas who had submitted, and those who had not; and a body of 100 Hindust\u00e1n\u00ed Irregulars, sent to the assistance of the former, were driven out by the latter.\n\nIn 1821, a large force was employed to reduce the Larkas; and after a month's hostilities, the leaders, encouraged by a proclamation, surrendered, and entered into agreements to pay tribute to the Singhbh\u00fam chiefs, to keep the roads open and safe, to give up offenders, and also agreed that 'if they were oppressed by any of the chiefs, they would not resort to arms, but would complain to the officer commanding the troops on the frontier, or to some other competent authority.' After a year or two of peace, however, they again became restive, and gradually extended the circle of their depredations. The assistance rendered by them to the N\u00e1gpur Kols in the rebellion of 1831\u201332 was too gross a defiance of the Government to escape serious notice. Sir Thomas Wilkinson, who was then Agent to the Governor-General for the newly formed Non-Regulation Province of the South-Western Frontier, at once recognised the necessity of a thorough subjugation of the Kols, and equally the impolicy and futility of forcing them to submit to the chiefs. He proposed an occupation of Singhbh\u00fam by an adequate force, and suggested that, when the people were thoroughly subdued, they should be placed under the direct management of a British officer, to be stationed at Ch\u00e1ib\u00e1s\u00e1 in the heart of their country. These views were accepted; a force under Colonel Richards entered Singhbh\u00fam in November 1836, and by the end of the February following, all the refractory head-men had submitted and entered into engagements to\nbear true allegiance to the British Government. From this time until 1857 there was no disturbance, and the District seemed to have settled down into quietness and prosperity. In that year, the Par\u00e1h\u00e1t R\u00e1j\u00e1, after wavering for a little between loyalty and rebellion, chose the latter, and a considerable section of the Kols supported him. A tedious and difficult campaign ensued, the rebels taking refuge in the mountain fastnesses whenever they were driven from the plains. Eventually, however, they surrendered (in 1859), and the capture of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 put an end to the disturbances.\n\nSince that year the Kols have given no trouble. Under the judicious management of a succession of officers, whose names will always be household words in the Kolh\u00e1n, these savages have been gradually tamed, softened, and civilised, rather than subjugated. Up to a few years ago, they steadily opposed the opening of roads through their territory, removing from the villages to the hills (their usual custom when dissatisfied and excited) till the obnoxious posts set up to mark the alignment were taken down, and the project abandoned. Now their country is in all directions traversed by good roads, made by themselves under the superintendence of their officers. New sources of industrial wealth have been opened out, new crops requiring more careful cultivation introduced, new wants created and supplied; even a desire for education has been engendered and fostered, and already well-educated Kols are to be found among the clerks of the Ch\u00e1i-b\u00e1s\u00e1 courts. The ameliorating influences of Christianity have also made themselves felt, in a striking manner, among the Kols. The work has gone on with increasing vigour of late years, and the number of converts is now much larger than the returns of 1881 (quoted below) indicate.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The first attempt at an enumeration of the people of Singhbh\u00fam was made in 1867, when a Census was undertaken of the Government estate of the Kolh\u00e1n. From the results of this, an estimate was made for the total population of the District, as then constituted, which amounted, according to the calculations, to 355,906 souls. The regular Census of 1872, on an area corresponding to the present District, returned the population at 318,180. The last enumeration in 1881 disclosed a population of 453,775, showing an apparent increase of 135,595, or 42\u00b761 per cent., in nine years\u2014an increase, however, mainly due to defective enumeration in 1872.\n\nThe results of the Census of 1881 may be summarized as follows:\u2014Area of District, 3753 square miles, with 1 town and 3000 villages; number of houses, 86,306, namely, occupied 85,843, and unoccupied 463. Total population, 453,775, namely, males 226,681, and females 227,094. Average density of the population, 121 persons per square mile; villages per square mile, 0\u00b780; persons per village, 151; houses\nper square mile, 23; inmates per house, 5\u00b729. Classified according to sex and age, the population consisted of\u2014under 15 years of age, boys 100,404, and girls 95,695; total children, 196,099, or 43\u00b72 per cent. of the population: 15 years and upwards, males 126,277, and females 131,399; total adults, 257,676, or 56\u00b78 per cent.\n\nReligion.\u2014Classified according to religion, the population in 1881 consisted of\u2014Hindus, 447,810, or 98\u00b768 per cent. of the total; Muhammadans, 2329; Christians, 2988; and \u2018others,\u2019 648, consisting entirely of non-Hindu Sant\u00e1ls.\n\nAmong aboriginal tribes, the most numerous are the Kols, of whom there were 187,723 in 1881, all returned as Hindus by religion. The name Kol, as popularly used, includes not only Hos and Mundas, but also the Dravidian Ur\u00e1ons, while its scientific use embraces the cognate Kolarian tribes of Mundas, Hos or Larka Kols, Bh\u00famijs, and Kharw\u00e1rs. The two last tribes are returned separately in the Census Report of 1881, the former numbering 40,070, and the latter 3822, thus making a total Kol population of 231,615, or 51 per cent. of that of the whole District. The bulk of the Kols enumerated above are Hos, otherwise called Larka or \u2018fighting\u2019 Kols, the characteristic aboriginal race of Singhbh\u00fam.\n\nA detailed account of this tribe, taken from Colonel Dalton\u2019s Ethnology of Bengal, will be found in The Statistical Account of Bengal, vol. xvii. pp. 39\u201359, and in a more abbreviated form under the article Kol, ante, vol. viii. pp. 253\u2013260. The Kols appear to have no traditions of origin or migration that throw much light on their history. As has been said in the preceding section, they isolated themselves jealously for many years, and even at the present day the exclusiveness of the old Hos is remarkable. They will not allow aliens to hold lands near their villages; and, indeed, if it were left to them, no strangers would be permitted to settle in the Koh\u00e1n. Physically, the Singhbh\u00fam Hos are the finest of all the Kolarian tribes. The men average 5 feet 5 or 6 inches in height; the women 5 feet 2 inches; and both men and women are noticeable for their fine erect carriage and long free stride. They do not encumber themselves with much clothing, and even wealthy men move about all but naked, as proudly as if they were clad in purple and fine linen. The Hos are fair marksmen with the bow and arrow, and great sportsmen. They are a purely agricultural people, and their festivals are all connected with that pursuit. They show great reverence for the dead, and their peculiar and touching funeral ceremonies are well described by Colonel Dalton. The same writer describes the Hos as possessing \u2018a manner free from servility, but never rude; a love, or at least the practice, of truth; a feeling of self-respect, rendering them keenly sensitive under rebuke;\u2019 and he adds that since they have come under our rule, \u2018they have become less sus-\npicious, less revengeful, less bloodthirsty, less contumacious,' than they were. They are still, however, easily excited to rash action.\n\nOf the other aboriginal tribes in Singhbhum, Santals number 52,602, of whom all but 648 are returned as Hindus. Bhuiyas number 8141; Gonds, 1628; and 'others,' 10,513. Total aborigines, 304,499, or 67.1 per cent. of the District population. It is singular that, although the Singhbhum aborigines are the wildest and most backward of all the Districts of the Chuti\u00e1 Nagpur Division, the whole of the aboriginal population, with the exception of 648 Santals, should be returned as Hindus by religion.\n\nAmong recognised Hindus, the higher castes are numerically very weak. Brahmins number only 2886; Rajputs, 1949; Kayasths, 993; Khandaitis, 391; and Baniyas, 2259. Among the lower or Sudra castes are included the following:\u2014Goala, the most numerous caste in the District, 38,672; Tanti, 20,839; Kurmi, 9122; Lohar, 7728; Kumbhar, 6882; Tel, 3394; Dhobi, 2626; Sunri, 2611; Mali, 2342; Napit, 2321; Dom, 2171; Hari, 1355; Sadgop, 1239; and Bauri, 1055. Caste-rejecting Hindus number 3491, including 2868 Vaishnavs.\n\nThe Muhammadans only number 2329, or 0.5 per cent. of the District population. None of the reforming sects of Islam are represented in Singhbhum; and the existing Musalm\u00e1n community makes no converts, except among Hindus who have been expelled from their caste. Nearly the whole of the native Christians are converts from the aboriginal races. Three missions are at work in the District\u2014the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, the Lutheran Evangelical Mission, and a Roman Catholic Mission.\n\nUrban and Rural Population.\u2014The population is entirely rural, and the only place with upwards of five thousand inhabitants is Chaibasa, which in 1881 contained a population of 6006. Of the 3000 villages, no less than 2276 contained less than two hundred inhabitants; 611 had between two hundred and five hundred; 106 between five hundred and a thousand; and 7 between one thousand and two thousand inhabitants. In the wilder jungles to the south and east of the Kolhan proper, there still exist, in the shape of tanks and architectural remains, traces of a people more civilised than the Kols of the present day. The most interesting of these are\u2014Benu Sagar, a fine tank surrounded by the ruins of what must have been a large town; Kiching, with its temples still resorted to by pilgrims; and two very curious artificial pools of water, called the Surmi and Durmi. The sepulchral and monumental stones which are characteristic of the Mundas and Hos occur in large numbers throughout the District.\n\nThe Material Condition of the People.\u2014The wonderful progress in the material condition of the people that has taken place of late years may\nbe vividly illustrated by two quotations from Government Reports. In reporting on Singhbhum District in 1854, Sir Henry Ricketts referred in the following terms to Captain Haughton's proposal that the *pan* or customary price paid for a wife should be abolished, as being a serious check to the increase of population:\u2014'For some reasons it certainly would be good were the custom abolished; but so long as the Kols continue to be what the Kols are now, any plan which has the effect of preventing an increase of their numbers is not without advantage. I cannot consider it desirable that there should be more Kols; though I would omit no endeavour to improve the condition, both moral and physical, of those who unfortunately hold some of the fairest *pargan\u00e1s* of Singhbhum.' In 1873, Captain Garbett described the Kol villages as 'perfect pictures of comfort and prettiness,' adding that 'the brisk attendance and business done at markets, the increasing use of brass instead of earthen utensils, the more common wearing by the women of a better description of *s\u00e1ri*, and a dozen other indications in themselves perhaps slight, but important in the aggregate, all attest the growing progressive prosperity of the people.' This improvement has been accompanied by a marked increase in the numbers of the people. In the hills and backwoods, types of the more primitive Ho may still be found; but in a few more years, if these wild foresters remain in their present condition, they will be altogether repudiated by their refined brethren round Chaibasa. The Hindu inhabitants of Singhbhum, chiefly Mathur\u00e1basis, Go\u00e1l\u00e1s, and Kurmis, are good cultivators, and some have risen to be substantial farmers. They are particularly enterprising in reclaiming waste land and founding new villages. Certainty of tenure, freedom from agrarian disputes, and low rates of rent all over the District are the chief causes which have effected this change in the material condition of the people, aided by the extension of roads in all directions, the development of fresh sources of industrial wealth\u2014such as the trade in *tasar* silk\u2014the cultivation of new crops, and the gradual spread of education.\n\n*Agriculture.*\u2014The system of rice cultivation is similar to that described in the article on Hazaribagh, though it is not so fully developed here as in that District and Lohardaga. Land is classified on the same principle, and the crops are the same; but, except in villages occupied by the Hindu caste of Kurmis, the general style of cultivation is primitive, and the land undergoes scarcely any systematic preparation for the crop. Of late years, however, the Kols have made a considerable advance in the methods of tillage, and now get three crops in the year when formerly they had but one. The chief crops of the District, besides rice, are wheat, Indian corn, peas, gram, mustard, sugar-cane, cotton, and tobacco. The area under different crops has been estimated as follows:\u2014Rice, 503,233 acres; cotton, 23,637 acres; Indian corn,\n63,029 acres; oil-seeds, 40,665 acres; wheat, 1271 acres; pulses, 3813 acres. As, however, great uncertainty attaches to all the agricultural statistics of the Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur Division, these figures must be looked upon as approximate only. Wages in Singhbh\u00fam have not risen of late years in proportion to the increase in the price of ordinary food staples. Labour is abundant, and families are, as usual in the case of a considerable aboriginal population, large. Unskilled labourers (male) receive from 2\u00bdd. to 3d. a day, and females 1\u00bdd. The rate for women is the same as it was in former times, but men used to receive only 1\u00bdd. Bricklayers and carpenters now earn 6d. per diem; formerly their wages were 3\u00bed. The average price of the best cleaned rice is about 2s. 9d. per cwt., and of coarse rice 2s. 3\u00bdd. The price of the best unhusked rice is about 1s. 1d., and of Indian corn 1s. 8\u00bdd. per cwt. These prices represent a rise of from 25 to 50 per cent. on the rates which ruled twenty years ago.\n\nThe prevailing land tenures vary in different parts of the District. In the Kolh\u00e1n there is now only one kind of tenure,\u2014under which rent is paid direct to Government by each individual cultivator, whose right of occupation is hereditary, but liable to enhancement of rent at the expiration of the current settlement. Dhalbh\u00fam bears a fixed assessment of \u00a3426, 14s. It was originally one of the Jungie Mah\u00e1ls, and was transferred to Singhbh\u00fam from M\u00e1nbh\u00fam in 1846. The proprietor of the pargan\u00e1 calls himself R\u00e1j\u00e1, but he is officially styled zam\u00ednd\u00e1r. The Kolh\u00e1n pays an assessment of \u00a34606 a year; the Par\u00e1h\u00e1t estate, \u00a31760; and Baudg\u00e1on, \u00a367. Among the intermediate tenures between the zam\u00ednd\u00e1r and the cultivators may be mentioned\u2014khoroposh or maintenance grants (74 in number) to younger members of the zam\u00ednd\u00e1r's family; gh\u00e1tw\u00e1l\u00ed tenures for some kinds of police service, the precise nature of which cannot now be ascertained; and sad chakr\u00e1n holdings (51), service tenures entirely dependent on the pleasure of the zam\u00ednd\u00e1r. The other prevalent intermediate tenures are\u2014Brahmottar, 93; debottar, 85; and pradh\u00e1n\u00ed or farming leases for (839) limited or (74) unlimited periods. The actual cultivating tenures in Dhalbh\u00fam are known by the generic term praj\u00e1li (from praj\u00e1, a peasant), and are of two kinds, kh\u00fant katti and thik\u00e1. The kh\u00fant katti cultivators are supposed to be descendants of the persons who originally reclaimed the land from jungle, and formed the village; all of them have permanent rights of occupancy, and some have the further privilege of holding at a fixed rate of rent. Cultivators holding under the thik\u00e1 tenure are persons who came into the village after the first reclaimers. Their holdings are not transferable, and they have no share in the common rights of the village. Chakr\u00e1n or service holdings are very numerous, and the chiefs consequently derive a proportionally small income from their large estates.\nNatural Calamities.\u2014The District is subject to partial scarcities, caused by deficiency in the local rainfall. In years of drought, the cultivators resort to artificial reservoirs, wells, and tanks for water to irrigate their fields. The famine of 1866 was felt throughout the District, but only severely in Dhalbh\u00fam, where the chief food of the people is rice. The highest price reached for ordinary rice in Singhbh\u00fam in that year (in August) was \u00a31, 2s. a cwt. The District mainly depends on the winter rice; and if the yield of that crop were to be less than one-half, and if the price of ordinary rice were to rise as high as from 7s. to 9s. a cwt., these symptoms should be considered as a warning of approaching famine.\n\nCommerce and Trade, etc.\u2014The trade of Singhbh\u00fam is carried on mainly by means of permanent markets, the chief of which are held at Ch\u00e1ib\u00e1s\u00e1, Khars\u00e1w\u00e1n, S\u00e1raikal\u00e1, and Bah\u00e1ragarh\u00e1. The principal exports are grain, pulses, oil-seeds, stick-lac, iron, and tasar-silk cocoons; the chief imports\u2014salt, cotton yarn, English piece-goods, tobacco, and brass utensils. The value of the silk export was estimated in 1871 to amount to \u00a310,000; and it is said that the total value of the exports largely exceeds that of the imports. The chief manufactures of Singhbh\u00fam are coarse cotton cloth, brass and earthenware cooking utensils, and soapstone platters. There are a few weavers of tasar-silk cloth in S\u00e1raikal\u00e1. Copper is found in S\u00e1raikal\u00e1 and Dhalbh\u00fam, and an English Company was started in 1857 to work the mine. The enterprise was conducted on too expensive a scale, and failed in 1859; a second Company, formed in 1862, was not more fortunate, and was dissolved in 1864, without having even paid rent for the two years over which its operations extended. The total length of roads in Singhbh\u00fam in 1883 was 536 miles.\n\nAdministration.\u2014In 1837, the revenue of the District, which was then smaller in area than at present, amounted to \u00a3527, almost entirely derived from land; and the current expenditure to \u00a31011, or nearly double the revenue. In 1846, the pargan\u00e1 of Dhalbh\u00fam, assessed in perpetuity at \u00a3426, was added to the District; and in 1850-51, the total revenue was returned at \u00a31219, and the civil expenditure at \u00a31928. Thus within a period of thirteen years, between 1837 and 1850-51, the revenue more than doubled, owing mainly to the extension of cultivation in the Kolh\u00e1n, and the amount accruing from Dhalbh\u00fam. It failed, however, to cover the expenditure on civil administration, which had increased by 58 per cent. within the same period. In 1870-71, the net revenue had risen to \u00a39500, and the total expenditure to \u00a310,163. In 1883-84, the revenue was \u00a310,084, and the cost of civil administration \u00a36096. The land-tax forms by far the largest item in the revenue of the District. In 1837 it amounted to \u00a3523, derived solely from the\nKolh\u00e1n. In 1846, the land revenue was \u00a31133; and the zamindar of Dhalbh\u00fam was the only registered proprietor, and Dhalbh\u00fam and the Kolh\u00e1n were the only two estates on the District rent-roll. In 1883\u201384, the land revenue was \u00a36096, the number of estates being four, namely, the Kolh\u00e1n, Dhalbh\u00fam, Par\u00e1h\u00e1t, and Baudgi\u00f3n.\n\nIn 1883, the regular police force numbered 161 men of all ranks, maintained at a total cost of \u00a33277. There was also a rural police or village watch of 546 men, maintained by contributions from the villagers, and costing \u00a3956. The total machinery, therefore, for the protection of person and property in the District consisted of 607 officers and men, showing (according to the Census returns of area and population) 1 man to every 6.2 square miles of the area and to every 747 of the population. The estimated total cost was \u00a34233, giving an average of \u00a31, 2s. 6\u00bdd. per square mile of area and 2\u00bdd. per head of the population. Suicide is a characteristic crime of the District, chiefly among the Kols, who are an extremely sensitive race. The average daily number of prisoners in the Ch\u00e1ib\u00e1s\u00e1 jail in 1883 was 63.\n\nThe progress of education in Singhbh\u00fam has, owing to its secluded position, been very slow, but of late years there has been a great improvement. The number of Government and aided schools in 1870\u201371 was 9, with 684 pupils. By 1882\u201383 the number of schools had increased to 170, and the pupils to about 8500. The Census Report of 1881 returned 4540 boys and 107 girls as under instruction, besides 4655 males and 132 females able to read and write but not under instruction.\n\nThere are no administrative Sub-divisions in Singhbh\u00fam, nor are there any pargans properly so called. The real internal divisional units of the District are the estates already referred to. The p\u00edr, or group of villages, is the administrative unit of the old village organization of the Hos and Mundas; but the fiscal character which it bears in the Kolh\u00e1n is solely of British institution, and does not form part of the indigenous system. It is both smaller and more symmetrical than the pargan\u00e1 of the Regulation Districts.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate of Singhbh\u00fam is, as might be supposed from its inland position, dry. The civil station of Ch\u00e1ib\u00e1s\u00e1 is healthy, but the jungle-clad hill tracts are so malarious that they cannot be visited with safety before the month of November. December and January are the coldest months, and at this season the thermometer sometimes falls as low as 50\u00b0 F. The weather in the hot season is extremely trying, the thermometer frequently marking 106\u00b0 F. in the shade. The average annual rainfall is returned at 57 inches. The prevailing endemic diseases are intermittent and remittent fevers of the ordinary type. Epidemics of small-pox and cholera have occasionally occurred; the severest recent outbreak of cholera was that which immediately followed the famine of 1866. There is a charitable\ndispensary at Ch\u00e1ib\u00e1s\u00e1. [For further information regarding Singhbh\u00fam, see The Statistical Account of Bengal, by W. W. Hunter, vol. xvii. pp. 1\u2013146 (London, Tr\u00fcbner & Co., 1877); also Mr. (the late Sir Henry) Rickett's Report on Singhbh\u00fam District (1854); the Bengal Census Report for 1881; and the several annual Administration and Departmental Reports of the Bengal Government.]\n\nSingheswarth\u00e1n.\u2014Village in Bh\u00e1galpur District, Bengal; situated in lat. $25^\\circ 58' 48''$ N., and long. $86^\\circ 50' 31''$ E., 4 miles north of Madahpur\u00e1. Well known in Behar for being the scene of the largest elephant fair north of the Ganges; this is held in January, and attended by traders from Purniah, Monghyr, T\u00edrh\u00fat, and the neighbouring parts of Nep\u00e1l. Native shoes, English cloth, horses, long Nep\u00e1lese knives or kukris form the other principal articles of commerce. Temple belonging to the P\u00e1ndes.\n\nSinghpur.\u2014Town in Narsinghpur tahs\u00edl, Narsinghpur District, Central Provinces. Population (1881) 3130, namely, Hindus, 2612; Muhammadans, 343; Kab\u00edranth\u00eds, 40; and non-Hindu aboriginal tribes, 135.\n\nSinghpur (or Sowasth\u00e1n Sinhpur).\u2014Petty State in the Mehw\u00e1s tract of Kh\u00e1ndesh District, Bombay. Population (1881) 646. A small tract of plain country covered by thick forest, which, besides timber, yields mah\u00fa\u00e1 flowers, wax, and honey. The soil is good, but, except near villages, is little cultivated. The chief is a Bh\u00edl.\n\nSing\u00edm\u00e1ri.\u2014Village in the south-west of Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1 District, Assam, near the left bank of the Brahmaputra; about 42 miles west of Tur\u00e1 station in the G\u00e1ro Hills, with which it is connected by road. An important weekly market is held in the village, which is largely resorted to by the G\u00e1ros.\n\nSing\u00edm\u00e1ri.\u2014Principal river of Kuch Behar State, Bengal. Entering the State under the name of the J\u00e1ldhak\u00e1, at its extreme north-west corner, near Moranger-h\u00e1t in Khiti, it flows in a south-eastern direction by the villages of Gil\u00e1d\u00e1ng\u00e1, P\u00e1nigr\u00e1m, Dhaib\u00e1ng\u00e1, Khaterb\u00e1r\u00ed, and M\u00e1t\u00e1bh\u00e1ng\u00e1. In the middle of its course it is called the Mansh\u00e1hi, and lower down, the Sing\u00edm\u00e1ri. It has several cross communications with the Dharl\u00e1 or Torsh\u00e1, and finally joins that river on the southern border of the State, near the trading villages of Durg\u00e1pur and Git\u00e1l-daha. It has several large tributaries, among which may be mentioned the Mujn\u00e1i, Satang\u00e1, Duduy\u00e1, Dolang, and D\u00e1lkho\u00e1. The capital of Kuch Behar was formerly situated on the banks of the Sing\u00edm\u00e1ri, near Gos\u00e1in\u00edmar\u00e1i (at Kamat\u00e1pur), where the ruins of temples and fortresses still attest the bygone greatness of former days. The river is navigable all the year round by boats of 100 maunds burden as far as the Sub-divisional station of M\u00e1t\u00e1bh\u00e1ng\u00e1, and even a little beyond, and in the rainy season is largely used for navigation.\nSingl\u00e1.\u2014River in the extreme south-east of Sylhet District, Assam, flowing north from the Lush\u00e1i Hills into the Kusi\u00e1ra branch of the Surm\u00e1 river. It has given its name to an elephant mah\u00e1l or hunting-ground, and also to a forest reserve.\n\nSingpho Hills.\u2014Tract of country bordering the extreme eastern frontier of Assam, occupied by the Singphos, a wild tribe who are said to be an offshoot of the Ka-khyens of Burma. In their own language, the word \u2018Singpho\u2019 means man. In ethnical characteristics, language, and religion, the Singphos differ markedly from the Khamt\u00eds and other neighbouring races of Shan origin. They are said to have first settled in their present home towards the close of the 18th century, when the power of the Aham kings was falling into decay. Their permanent villages were placed on the Teng\u00e1p\u00e1n\u00ed river east of Sadiy\u00e1, and on the Buri Dihing river in the tract called N\u00e1mrup. They took advantage of the disturbed state of Upper Assam, caused by the rebellion of the Mo\u00e1m\u00e1ri\u00e1s, to ravage the whole valley of the Brahmaputra, and carry off numbers of the Assamese into slavery. At the present time, there is a mongrel race well known in Upper Assam under the name of Doanniy\u00e1s, sprung from the intercourse between the Singphos and their female slaves. When the British took possession of the Province, these raids were suppressed. Captain Neufville, the commandant at Sadiy\u00e1, is said to have released 5000 Assamese captives after a single expedition. The Singphos have now entirely abandoned their old habits of lawlessness. They live by agriculture, and have considerable skill in the smelting of iron and in the weaving of cotton into coloured plaid checks. According to the Census Report of 1872, they only numbered 257 souls in the settled portion of Lakhimpur District. In 1881, the Census returned the Singphos at 1774, still confined to Lakhimpur District.\n\nSingrauli.\u2014Tract of land in M\u00edrz\u00e1pur District, North-Western Provinces; consisting of a depressed alluvial basin, below the level of the surrounding country, and composed in parts of a rich black loam, merging at other places into a hard and unproductive clay.\n\nSingraur.\u2014Village in Sor\u00e1on tahsil, Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d District, North-Western Provinces; situated in lat. 25\u00b0 35' 3\" N., and long. 81\u00b0 41' 10\" E., 18 miles north-west of Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d city. Population (1881) 1723. Singraur is said to have been a large place in former days, but the Ganges first undermined its southern face, and swept away a large portion of the town, leaving a precipitous cliff some 90 feet in height. Since then the river has deserted the town, and only a small branch now passes under Singraur, in the wide channel where the whole stream of the Ganges once passed along. Singraur was the scene of the last act in the rebellion of Kh\u00e1n Zam\u00e1n and his brother Bah\u00e1dur against Akbar. A ruined mound known as the Surya Bhita, a mile north of\nthe town, marks the site of an ancient Sun temple. Station of the Grand Trigonometrical Survey.\n\n**Sinh\u00e1chalam** (*Sinha*, \u2018a lion\u2019).\u2014Temple in Vizagapatam District, Madras Presidency; situated in lat. $17^\\circ 46'$ N., and long. $83^\\circ 11' 8''$ E., on a hill (800 feet above sea-level) 6 miles north-west of Vizagapatam town. The shrine, which is most picturesquely situated in a wooded glen, containing springs and beautiful cascades, is dedicated to the Lion incarnation of Vishnu, and is held in great veneration. It is believed to have been built by the Gajapati kings of Orissa, about 600 years ago; and among other handsome blackstone carvings, it bears an inscription dated 1526, recording the visit of the hero Krishna R\u00e1y\u00e1. About 200 years ago, it was endowed by the P\u00fasap\u00e1tis. It is now in the charge of the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 of Vizianagaram, who has a house and beautiful rose-garden here, the latter laid out by his ancestor S\u00edt\u00e1r\u00e1m R\u00e1o. The Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 has also built and endowed a *choultry* (native inn) for pilgrims.\n\n**Sinhgarh** (*Sinhgad*, \u2018Lion\u2019s fort\u2019).\u2014Hill fort in the Haveli Subdivision of Poona (Pun\u00e1) District, Bombay Presidency; lat. $18^\\circ 21' 51''$ N., and long. $73^\\circ 47' 51''$ E. Situated about 12 miles south-west of Poona city, on one of the highest points of the Sinhgarh-Bhuleswara range, 4322 feet above sea-level, and about 2300 feet above the plain.\n\nOn the north and south, Sinhgarh is a huge rugged mountain with a very steep ascent of nearly half a mile. From the slopes rises a great wall of black rock more than 40 feet high, crowned by nearly ruined fortifications. The fort is approached by pathways, and by two gates. The north-east or Poona gate is at the end of a winding ascent up a steep rocky spur; the Kaly\u00e1n or Konk\u00e1n gate to the south-west stands at the end of a less difficult ascent, guarded by three gateways, all strongly fortified and each commanding the other. The outer fortifications, which consist of a strong stone wall flanked with towers, enclose a nearly triangular space about two miles round. The north face of the fort is naturally strong; the south face, which was stormed by the English in 1818, is the weakest. The triangular plateau within the walls is resorted to as a health-resort by the European residents of Poona in April and May, and has several bungalows.\n\nThe fort was known as Kondh\u00e1na until in 1647 Sivaji changed its name to Sinhgarh. In 1340, the Delhi Emperor, Muhammad Tughlakh, blockaded the fort. In 1486 it fell to the founder of the Ahmadnagar dynasty on his capture of Shivner. In 1637, Kondh\u00e1na was given up to Bij\u00e1pur. In 1647, Sivaji acquired the fort by means of a large bribe to its Muhammadan commandant, and changed its name to Sinhgarh. In 1662, on the approach of a Mughal army under Shaista Kh\u00e1n, Sivaji fled from Supa to Sinhgarh; and from Sinhgarh he made his celebrated surprise on Shaista Kh\u00e1n\u2019s residence in Poona.\nIn 1665, a Mughal force blockaded Sinhgarh, and Sivaji submitted. In 1670, it was retaken by T\u00e1n\u00e1j\u00ed M\u00e1lusra; this capture forms one of the most daring exploits in Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 history. Between 1701 and 1703, Aurangzeb besieged Sinhgarh. After three and a half months\u2019 siege the fort was bought from the commandant, and its name changed to Bakhind\u00e1baksh, or \u2018God\u2019s gift.\u2019 In 1706, as soon as the Mughal troops marched from Poona to Bij\u00e1pur, Shankraj\u00ed N\u00e1r\u00e1yan Sachiv, chief manager of the country round, retook Sinhgarh and other forts. Sinhgarh remained with the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s till the war of 1818, when it was carried by storm by General Pritzler.\n\n**Sinjh\u00e1uli Sh\u00e1hz\u00e1dpur.**\u2014Town in Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d (Fyz\u00e1b\u00e1d) District, Oudh; situated in lat. 26\u00b0 24' N., and long. 82\u00b0 35' E., on a picturesque spot on the high bank of the Tons, opposite Akbarpur, 36 miles from Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d town, on the road to Jaunpur. Founded by Sujhawal, a Bhar chief, and called after him Sujhawalgarh, which has since been altered to Sinjh\u00e1uli. A certain Sayyid T\u00e1j settled here, and dug a tank; a tomb on an island within this tank bears an inscription dated 1365 A.D., one of the oldest in Oudh. A family of R\u00e1jput bankers formerly flourished here. Population (1881) 4522, of whom 1252 were Sunnis, 88 Shi\u00e1s, and 3182 Hindus. Four mosques; 4 Hindu temples; 916 houses, of which 24 are of masonry.\n\n**Sinnar.**\u2014Sub-division of N\u00e1sik District, Bombay Presidency. Area, 519 square miles. Population (1881) 66,081, namely, males 33,359, and females 32,722, occupying 10,189 houses in 1 town and 98 villages. Hindus number 61,394; Muhammadans, 1978; and \u2018others,\u2019 2709. Sinnar, the southmost Sub-division of N\u00e1sik, is a rather bare table-land, bounded on the south by a high range of hills which run into Ahmadnagar District. The Sub-division contains soil of almost every variety. The water-supply, especially in the east and in the hilly parts to the south, is scanty. The climate is healthy. In 1880\u201381, 6277 holdings or kh\u00e1t\u00e1s were recorded, with an average area of 37 acres and an average assessment of \u00a32, 16s. In the same year, 187,797 acres were under actual cultivation, of which 2473 acres were twice cropped. Cereals and millets occupied 164,090 acres; pulses, 14,179 acres; oil-seeds, 8088 acres; fibres, 225 acres; and miscellaneous crops, 3688 acres. In 1883 the Sub-division contained 1 civil and 2 criminal courts; police circle (th\u00e1nd), 1; regular police, 45 men; village watch (chauk\u00edd\u00e1rs), 124. Land revenue, \u00a315,073.\n\n**Sinnar.**\u2014Town and municipality in N\u00e1sik District, Bombay Presidency, and head-quarters of Sinnar Sub-division; situated in lat. 19\u00b0 50' 25\" N., and long. 74\u00b0 2' 30\" E., on the N\u00e1sik and Poona road, 17 miles south-east of the former town. It is a municipal town, with a population (1881) of 7960 persons, almost entirely engaged in agriculture. Hindus number 7288; Muhammadans, 525; Jains, 75; Christians, 11;\nand 'others,' 61. Municipal revenue in 1883-84, \u00a3184; incidence of taxation per head of population, 5\u00bdd. Sub-judge's court, post-office, dispensary, and two vernacular schools. Weekly market on Sundays. A large portion of the land around the town is irrigated, and produces rich crops of sugar-cane, plantains, betel-leaves, and rice. Except 173 looms, chiefly for weaving robes or s\u00e1ris, and a few silk weavers, Sinnar has no trade or manufacture. Sinnar is said to have been founded by a Gauli R\u00e1j\u00e1, whose son, R\u00e1o Govind, built the handsome temple outside the town, at a cost of 2 l\u00e1khs of rupees (say \u00a320,000). The town was at one time the head-quarters of the local government under the Mughal Emperors.\n\n**Siob\u00e1ra** (or Shivb\u00e1ra).\u2014Petty Bh\u00edl State in Kh\u00e1ndesh District, Bombay Presidency.\u2014See DANG STATES.\n\n**Sioh\u00e1ra.**\u2014Poor but populous town in Bijnaur (Bijnor) District, North-Western Provinces; situated in lat. 29\u00b0 12' N., and long. 78\u00b0 38' E., on the Morad\u00e1b\u00e1d and Hardw\u00e1r road, 28 miles south-east of Bijnaur town. Population (1881) 9014, namely, Muhammadans, 6119; Hindus, 2825; and Jains, 70. Station on the recently opened northern extension of the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway.\n\n**Sipr\u00e1** (Sipri).\u2014River of Central India, rising in M\u00e1lw\u00e1, on the north side of the Vindhyan range, 11 miles east of the small town of Pipalda, in lat. 22\u00b0 37' N., and long. 76\u00b0 12' E. 'It has,' writes Thornton, 'a winding course, generally north-westerly, through a fertile country. About 40 miles from its source it receives on its left side the small river Kaund, and, passing subsequently by the towns of Ujjain and Mehidpur, falls into the Chambal, on its right bank, in lat. 23\u00b0 54' N., and long. 75\u00b0 29' E., after a total course of 120 miles. . . . During the rains, the Sipr\u00e1 swells and overflows many places on its banks. In 1821, it rose to such a height as to wash away part of the town of Mehidpur.'\n\n**Sira.**\u2014T\u00e1luk in T\u00famk\u00far District, Mysore State; having been transferred from Chitaldrug District in 1868. Area, 590 square miles, of which 132 are cultivated. Population (1881) 49,889, namely, males 25,543, and females 24,346. Hindus number 47,760; Muhammadans, 2119; and Christians, 10. Land revenue (1881-82), exclusive of water rates, \u00a38587, or 2s. 10d. per cultivated acre. The cocoa-nuts are of a specially fine quality. In 1883 the t\u00e1luk contained 1 criminal court, with 4 police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s); regular police, 56 men; village watch (chaukid\u00e1rs), 182.\n\n**Sira.**\u2014Town in T\u00famk\u00far District, Mysore State; situated in lat. 13\u00b0 44' 43\" N., and long. 76\u00b0 57' 16\" E., 33 miles north-north-west of T\u00famk\u00far town, and 73 miles north-west from Bangalore; head-quarters of the Sira t\u00e1luk. Population (1881) 3154, dwelling in 669 houses. Hindus number 2292, and Muhammadans 862.\nFormerly the capital of a Muhammadan Province. Its foundation is attributed to Rangappa N\u00e1yak, of Ratn\u00e1giri; but before the fort was completed, it was captured, in 1638, by Randull\u00e1 Kh\u00e1n, general of the Bij\u00e1pur King. Shortly afterwards, Sira was included in the j\u00e1gir granted to the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 Sh\u00e1hj\u00ed, the father of Siv\u00e1j\u00ed the Great. In 1687, on the conquest of the Bij\u00e1pur kingdom by the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb, Sira was made the capital of a new Province south of the Tungabhadra, which nominally included the greater part of the modern State of Mysore. The two best known Naw\u00e1bs or Governors were K\u00e1sim Kh\u00e1n and Dil\u00e1war Kh\u00e1n. Under the latter ruler, the town attained its highest prosperity. The number of houses is said to have been 50,000. An elegant palace, erected by Dil\u00e1war Kh\u00e1n, now in ruins, furnished the model for the palaces of Bangalore and Seringapatam. In 1757, Sira was taken by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, but recovered for the Musalm\u00e1ns by Haidar Ali in 1761. During the great struggle for power in the Karn\u00e1tik, Sira suffered severely. On one occasion, Tip\u00fa transported 12,000 families to form the population of his new town of Ganj\u00e1m. The finest buildings now standing are the Jam\u00e1 Masjid of hewn stone, and the fort also of stone, with a regular moat and glacis.\n\nA large proportion of the inhabitants are Kurubars by caste, who manufacture kamblis or coarse blankets to the total value of about \u00a3500 in the year. The price of each blanket varies from 1s. to \u00a31, 4s. Common sealing-wax is also made, but the weaving of chintz is now an extinct industry.\n\nSiraguppa (Siruguppa).\u2014Town in Bellary t\u00e1luk, Bellary District, Madras Presidency. A badly built, unhealthy town, situated on the south bank of the Tungabhadra river, in lat. 15\u00b0 38' 50\" N., and long 76\u00b0 56' 30\" E. Population (1881) 5013, occupying 1181 houses. Hindus number 3327, and Muhammadans 1686.\n\nSir\u00e1jganj (Serajgunge).\u2014Sub-division of P\u00e1bn\u00e1 District, Bengal, lying between 24\u00b0 0' 45\" and 24\u00b0 45' N. lat., and between 89\u00b0 17' and 89\u00b0 53' E. long. Area, 946 square miles; villages, 2095; houses, 97,543. Population (1881) 699,764, namely, males 346,880, and females 352,884. Hindus numbered 178,831; Muhammadans, 520,671; Christians, 38; and Jains, 224. Average number of persons per square mile, 740; villages per square mile, 2\u00b721; houses per square mile, 105; persons per village, 334; inmates per house, 7\u00b717. This Sub-division consists of the four police circles of Shahz\u00e1dpur, Ul\u00e1p\u00e1ra, Sir\u00e1jganj, and R\u00e1iganj. In 1883 it contained 3 magisterial and 3 civil courts, a police force of 128 men, and a village watch of 2200 men.\n\nSir\u00e1jganj.\u2014Town in P\u00e1bn\u00e1 District, Bengal, and the most important river mart in the Province; situated near the Jamun\u00e1 or main\nstream of the Brahmaputra, in lat. $24^\\circ 26' 58''$ N., and long. $89^\\circ 47' 5''$ E. Population (1872) 18,873; (1881) 21,037, namely, males 11,213, and females 9824. Muhammadans number 12,285; Hindus, 8574; and 'others,' 178. Municipal income (1876\u201377), \u00a3573; (1883\u201384), \u00a31265, of which \u00a3921 was derived from taxation; average incidence of taxation, 10s.d. per head. The town consists of 12 streets, and is traversed by the P\u00e1bna and Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1ikon\u00e1 roads; it contains only 1 market; there are 4 gh\u00e1ts or landing-places, viz. Ferry gh\u00e1t on the Dh\u00e1nbandi river (which flows through Sir\u00e1jganj), K\u00e1lib\u00e1ri, Rahua-b\u00e1ri, and the Jute Company's gh\u00e1t in M\u00e1chimpur.\n\nThe following description of Sir\u00e1jganj and its river trade is condensed from the Report on the River Trade of Bengal for 1876\u201377, the facts having been originally supplied by Mr. Nolan, who was for several years Magistrate of the Sir\u00e1jganj Sub-division:\n\nThe town is said to take its name from a local zam\u00ednd\u00e1r, called Sir\u00e1j Al\u00ed, who first opened a b\u00e1z\u00e1r here in the beginning of the present century. It then stood upon the bank of the Jamun\u00e1; but in 1848 an excessive flood of the river washed the entire town away. The traders thereupon retreated some 5 miles backward to the new bank; and when the river, in a fresh caprice, returned to its old channel, they determined to remain where they were, safe from inundation, though at a long distance from their daily place of business. During the rainy season, from June to October, the Jamun\u00e1 comes down in flood, overflowing the waste of sand between the houses and the b\u00e1z\u00e1r, and filling the branch stream that passes through the town. For the rest of the year, business is entirely conducted on the permanent bank of the Jamun\u00e1, wherever that may happen to be, for the mighty river sweeps away acres of land and alters its navigable channel every year. Hence it is that Sir\u00e1jganj has been described from the deck of a Brahmaputra steamer as 'a town without houses.' Scarceiy a warehouse stands on the river's brink, nor a tree to afford shelter. Large boats and flats lie anchored in mid-stream; fleets of smaller craft take shelter in the natural bends of the river; while the merchants and brokers move to and fro in light dinghis, to conduct their transactions on the spot. The bright head-dresses of the M\u00e1rw\u00e1ris afford a lively contrast to the white robes of the Beng\u00e1l\u00eds and the riding costumes and pith hats of the Europeans. On the shore, crowds of coolies are busy landing the open 'hanks' of jute, packing them into 'drums,' and again reshipping them for Calcutta. All this is done under the blaze of a tropical sun; and all those engaged have to traverse twice daily the blinding waste of 5 miles of sand that intervenes between their houses and the river.\n\nIn 1877 there were six European firms, or branches of firms, established at Sir\u00e1jganj; and also an agency of the Bank of Bengal, which\nimports specie every year to the amount of about \u00a3500,000, to liquidate the favourable balance of exchange. The principal native merchants are M\u00e1rw\u00e1ris, locally known as K\u00e1yas, who are immigrants from R\u00e1jput\u00e1na, and mostly profess the Jain religion. Their head-quarters in Bengal are in Murshid\u00e1b\u00e1d District, but their operations extend as far as the eastern corner of Assam. Like their brethren in the Deccan, they are a clannish race, who undertake considerable speculations in reliance upon the good faith of their numerous and distant correspondents. They are described as honest, frugal, and diligent, but quite uneducated. The Beng\u00e1l\u00ed traders chiefly belong to the caste of Sh\u00e1h\u00e1s. They are very intelligent, but lack enterprise and confidence in one another.\n\nThe business of Sir\u00e1jganj is mainly that of a changing station. The agricultural produce of all the country round is brought in in small boats, either by the cultivators themselves or by petty dealers, and here transferred to the wholesale merchants, for shipment to Calcutta in steamers or large cargo boats. In return, piece-goods, salt, hardware, and all sorts of miscellaneous articles are received from Calcutta for distribution. In 1876\u201377, the aggregate value of the registered trade of Sir\u00e1jganj, including both exports and imports, amounted to more than 3\u00bd millions sterling; but in this total a great deal is counted twice over. The following are the principal items, in one table or the other:\n\n\u2014 Jute, \u00a3606,000; European piece-goods, \u00a3264,000; salt, \u00a3263,000; oil-seeds, \u00a3171,000; oil, \u00a397,000; rice and other grain, \u00a383,000; sugar, \u00a383,000; tobacco, \u00a374,000; gunny-bags, \u00a369,000. The larger half of this trade is conducted direct with Calcutta, to which the exports in 1876\u201377 were valued at \u00a3831,000. Next in importance comes the trade of the surrounding country, and then the supply of rice and general stores to the coolies on the Assam tea-gardens. The relative amount of business done with the neighbouring Districts is shown by the following figures:\u2014 Imports from Rangpur, 830,000 maunds of jute, 62,000 maunds of tobacco, and 28,000 maunds of oil-seeds; exports to Rangpur, 167,000 maunds of salt and \u00a318,000 of piece-goods; imports from Maimansingh, 294,000 maunds of jute and 140,000 maunds of mustard seed; exports to Maimansingh, 71,000 maunds of salt and \u00a343,000 of piece-goods; imports from Kuch Behar, 160,000 maunds of jute and 28,000 maunds of tobacco; exports to Kuch Behar, 35,000 maunds of salt; imports from Jalp\u00e1i\u011furi, 44,000 maunds of jute and 40,000 maunds of tobacco; imports from Bogra, 209,000 maunds of jute; imports from Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1 in Assam, 98,000 maunds of jute and 166,000 maunds of mustard seed. Owing to the discontinuance of the registration of the total traffic of Sir\u00e1jganj in the beginning of 1878, later figures than those given above are not available. Certain statistics with\nregard to the trade with Calcutta are shown in the following paragraphs.\n\nThe export jute trade is conducted entirely with Calcutta, and fluctuates according to the demand in that market. The largest figures were reached in 1872\u201373, when the local estimate made from the books of the traders was 3,500,000 maunds. In 1876\u201377, the registered total was 2,021,168 maunds, valued at \u00a3606,000; in 1877\u201378, 2,156,307 maunds; and in 1885\u201386, 2,621,629 maunds, being in each year the largest figure for any mart in the interior of Bengal. There are three means of communication with Calcutta, which compete actively with one another\u2014by country boat, by steamer, and by rail. The two latter now carry together upwards of two-thirds of the total. The proportion carried by them has increased by upwards of a third since 1877. In 1876\u201377, 993,654 maunds went by boat, 567,673 by rail, and 450,841 by steamer. In 1885\u201386, 835,401 maunds of jute were despatched to Calcutta by boat, 763,740 maunds by rail, and 1,022,488 maunds by steamer. The time taken by the railway is only two days, as compared with eight or nine days by steamer, and somewhat less than thirty days by boat. Freights, of course, vary; but the railway and the steamers always maintain the same rate with one another. The freight by boat ranges from \u00a31, 19s. to \u00a33, 10s. per 1000 maunds, averaging about 6d. per maund; that by both rail and steamer ranges from 7\u00bdd. to 1s. 4\u00bdd. per maund, averaging about 10\u00bdd. But, as is usual in India, these figures are only nominal, and several reductions require to be made before an exact comparison can be instituted. The boats ship by a local maund of 84\u00b710 lbs., and it has become customary to load a 1000-maund boat with 1100 maunds, or an excess of 10 per cent. The railway uses a maund of exactly 80 lbs., and the steamers one of 82\u00bd lbs. Altogether, making every allowance (inclusive of insurance at the rate of 2\u00bd per cent. on boat cargoes, and the difference of discount between bills drawn at thirty and three days), it has been estimated that the total cost of transmitting 1100 maunds of jute from Sirajganj to Calcutta would average \u00a337, 11s. 6d. by boat, as compared with \u00a348, 6s. 3d. by rail. Despite this advantage in cheapness, the rail is preferred by the smaller traders, who would not be trusted by the insurance office, and could not themselves bear the risk of shipwreck; and it is largely used by all persons in a rising market, when the object is to get the fibre to Calcutta before a fall.\n\nThe Sirajganj Jute Company, which commenced business in 1869, has a large steam factory in the suburb of Machimpur, giving employment to over 3500 men, women, and children. As compared with the numerous mills on the Hugli, it labours under the disadvantage of having to import its coal, which can only be landed near the factory in\nthe rainy season; but besides supplying the local demand, it annually exports large numbers of gunny-bags to Calcutta. They are carried by rail at favourable rates, though the coal always comes up by boat. In 1876\u201377, the export of gunny-bags was 3,161,500 in number, valued at \u00a369,550. In 1877\u201378 the number was 2,950,625; while by 1885\u201386 it had increased to 6,061,240. In 1876\u201377, the import of coal for the use of the mill was 112,600 maunds, valued at \u00a35630. In 1885\u201386, coal was imported to Sir\u00e1jganj to the extent of 153,393 maunds.\n\nThe other principal articles of trade with Calcutta in 1885\u201386 were returned as follows:\u2014Exports from Sir\u00e1jganj: husked rice, 38,639 maunds; other food-grains, 13,633 maunds; oil-seeds, 365,837 maunds; drugs, 32,430 maunds; and tobacco, 29,250 maunds. Imports from Calcutta: piece-goods, value \u00a3273,427; salt, 469,787 maunds; and metals, chiefly manufactured, 16,069 maunds.\n\nThe municipal committee have twice taken a boat census of Sir\u00e1jganj. On 31st August 1873, the number of boats found was 1436, laden with 162,000 maunds of goods, of which nearly three-fifths was jute. On 4th September 1874, 1185 boats were counted, with cargoes aggregating 195,000 maunds. Sir\u00e1jganj was also a registration station, at which 49,644 boats were counted in the year 1876\u201377, passing up or down stream. The registration of traffic was abolished in the beginning of 1878, and later statistics than those given above, except as regards the trade with Calcutta, are not available.\n\nSirakot.\u2014Ruined fort and temple in Kum\u00e1un District, North-Western Provinces; situated in 29\u00b0 49' N. lat., and 80\u00b0 17' E. long., 9 miles north-west of the confluence of the Gori and Eastern K\u00e1li rivers. Elevation above sea-level, 6924 feet. Crowns a rocky ridge, with two of its sides scarped to a sheer depth of 2000 feet, and having its front terminated by a chasm 700 feet in depth. The narrow path from Almor\u00e1 to Nep\u00e1l winds round one of its flanks. The temple stands upon a conical rock, rising nearly perpendicularly from the ridge covered by the crumbling fortifications. During the G\u00farkha invasion in the early part of the century, the garrison was cut off from their water-supply, upon which they surrendered, and the fort has ever since remained in a ruinous condition.\n\nSir\u00e1li.\u2014Village in Makrai Native State, Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Central Provinces. Population (1881) 2025, namely, Hindus, 1753; Muhammadans, 271; and \u2018others,\u2019 1.\n\nSiralkoppa.\u2014Town and municipality in Shimoga District, Mysore State. Lat. 14\u00b0 20' 50\" N., long. 75\u00b0 19' 53\" E. Population (1881) 1954. Important mercantile centre, where the jaggery prepared from sugar-cane in the surrounding country is collected for despatch to the neighbouring Districts of Bombay and Madras. Piece-goods and\nblankets are received in exchange. Government distillery. A weekly fair held on Sundays is attended by 1700 persons. Municipal income in 1882, \u00a3102, or 1s. 0\u00bdd. per head of population.\n\nSiran (Sirin).\u2014River in Haz\u00e1ra District, Punjab; a tributary of the Indus. Rises at the head of the Bhogarmang glen, in lat. 34\u00b0 46' N., long. 73\u00b0 19' E., drains the Pakhli valley and the greater part of Tan\u00e1wal, and falls into the Indus at T\u00e1rbela (lat. 34\u00b0 5' N., long. 72\u00b0 44' E.), after a length of about 80 miles. Great variety of scenery in different parts of its course, from the wild mountain gorges of the upper glens to the broad expanse of irrigated rice-fields in the Pakhli vale, and the low but rugged hills of Tan\u00e1wal. Abounds in fish, especially the mah\u00e1sir. The Pakhli Sw\u00e1this call the Siran their 'female slave,' as it irrigates their fields, grinds their corn, husks their rice, and cleans their cotton. Numerous mills line the bank. Nowhere navigable; fordable almost everywhere, except during floods.\n\nSirasg\u00e1on.\u2014Town in Ellichpur District, Berar. Lat. 21\u00b0 20' N., long. 77\u00b0 45' E. Population (1881) 5408. Hindus number 4455; Muhammadans, 871; and Jains, 82. The town lands pay a revenue of \u00a31481, being the richest community in the District. Police outpost; Mar\u00e1th\u00ed and Urd\u00fa schools; small weekly market.\n\nSir\u00e1thu.\u2014North-western tahsil of Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d District, North-Western Provinces, conterminous with Karra pargan\u00e1; consisting of a rich and highly cultivated alluvial tract along the bank of the Ganges, with an upland tract fairly irrigated by wells, and with soil of an average quality. The Sasur-Khaderi n\u00e1di runs through the tahsil from north-west to south-east; and it is also intersected by the East Indian Railway and the Grand Trunk Road.\n\nThe area of the tahsil, according to the latest official statement (1881), was 236 square miles. Of this, 230 square miles were assessed for Government revenue, of which 140 square miles were cultivated, 42 square miles cultivable but not under tillage, and 54 square miles uncultivable waste. Government land revenue, \u00a320,495, or including local rates and cesses levied on the land, \u00a324,072. Total rental paid by cultivators, \u00a333,097. Population (1881) 123,386, namely, males 61,728, and females 61,658. Hindus number 104,450; Muhammadans, 18,935; and Christian, 1. Of the 252 villages in the tahsil, 165 contain less than five hundred inhabitants; 60 between five hundred and a thousand; 26 between one and five thousand; and 1 upwards of five thousand. In 1884 the Sub-division contained 1 civil and 1 criminal court, 3 police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), with a regular police of 46 men, and a village watch or rural force of 274 chaukid\u00e1rs.\n\nSir\u00e1thu.\u2014Village in Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d District, North-Western Provinces, and head-quarters of Sir\u00e1thu tahsil; situated in lat. 25\u00b0 39' 10\" N., long.\nSirdh\u00e1na.\u2014Town in Meerut (Merath) District, North-Western Provinces.\u2014See SARDHANA.\n\nSirguj\u00e1.\u2014Native State in Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur, Bengal.\u2014See SARGUJA.\n\nSirhind (Sarhind).\u2014Tract in the Lieutenant-Governorship of the Punjab; consisting of the north-eastern portion of the plain which intervenes between the Jumna and the Sutlej rivers. It includes the British Districts of Ambala (Umballa), Ludhiana, and Firozpur, together with the Native States of Patiala, Jind, and Nabha, each of which see separately. Sirhind has now no existence as an administrative division of territory; but in the historical sense, it includes all that portion of the cis-Sutlej tract which lies between the Simla Hills on the north-east, the Jumna Valley Districts (Karn\u00e1l and Rohtak) on the east, Hari\u00e1na (Sirsa and Hiss\u00e1r) on the south, and the Sutlej on the north-west; or more roughly speaking, it embraces the level plain between the Him\u00e1layas and the desert of Bikaner, the Sutlej and the Jumna. This tract comprises the whole watershed of the now deserted stream which once formed the great Saraswati (Sarsuti) river; and the newly opened Sirhind Canal will doubtless once more spread fertility over its somewhat desolate expanse. (For further particulars, see CIS-SUTLEJ STATES.)\n\nSirhind Canal.\u2014An important irrigation work, in Ambala (Umballa) and Ludhi\u00e1na Districts, and Pati\u00e1la, N\u00e1bha, and Jind States, Punjab. The canal draws its supply from the Sutlej near Rupar, and runs through Ludhi\u00e1na and Firozpur Districts. Other branches traverse Pati\u00e1la, N\u00e1bha, and Jind, terminating in Sirsa and Karn\u00e1l Districts. Water was admitted into the main canal in July 1882, but the branch system has not yet (1885) been completed, although the works are being pushed forward with great energy. Up to the close of the official year 1883-84, the total Government expenditure on capital account was \u00a35,033,284. This is exclusive of a large sum contributed by the Native States which will be benefited by the canal.\n\nSirmur (Sarmor).\u2014One of the sub-Him\u00e1layan or Hill States under the Government of the Punjab, frequently called Nah\u00e1n, from the name of the chief town. Sirmur is bounded on the north by the Hill States of Balsan and Jabbal; on the east by the British District of the Dehra D\u00fan, from which it is separated by the rivers Tons and Jumna; on the south-west by Ambala (Umballa) District, and some detached portions of the Native State of Kalsia; and on the north-west by the Native States of Pati\u00e1la and Keunth\u00e1l. It lies between lat. 30\u00b0 24'\nand $31^\\circ$ N., and between long. $77^\\circ 5'$ and $77^\\circ 50'$ E. Area, 1077 square miles. Population (1881) 112,371 souls.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014Except a very small tract about Nah\u00e1n, on the south-western extremity, where a few streams rise and flow south-westward to the Sarasw\u00e1ti (Sarsuti) and Ghaggar rivers, the whole of Sirmur lies in the basin of the Jumna, which receives from this quarter the Giri and its feeders, the Jal\u00e1l and the Pal\u00far. The river Tons, the great western arm of the stream called lower down the Jumna, flows along the eastern boundary of Sirmur, and on its right bank receives from it two small streams, the Minus and the Nairai. The surface of the State generally declines in elevation from north to south; the height of the trigonometrical station on the Chor Mountain on the northern frontier being 1,982 feet, and that of the confluence of the Giri and Jumna on the southern frontier about 1500 feet above sea-level. From that confluence, the valley of the Khi\u00e1rda D\u00fan stretches westward, forming the southern part of Sirmur, and extending about 25 miles in length from east to west, and from 13 to 6 in breadth, terminating to the west at the eastern base of the Nah\u00e1n ridge. Its surface rises gradually to the westward from the Jumna to the Ghatusan Pass, a distance of 14 miles. From Ghatusan, having an elevation of 2500 feet above the sea, the country falls both eastward, as already stated, and westward, the streams in the former direction flowing to the Jumna, and those in the latter to the Markanda and other rivers holding their course to the Sarasw\u00e1ti and Ghaggar. The Khi\u00e1rda D\u00fan is bounded on the south by the Siw\u00e1l\u00edk range. These hills are of recent formation, and abound in fossil remains of large vertebrate animals. On the north, the D\u00fan is bounded by the Sub-Him\u00e1layas. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 Ban, or royal forest, situated in the north-eastern angle of the D\u00fan, yields valuable s\u00e1l timber. Elephants are occasionally trapped in pits. The pasturage of the D\u00fan is exceedingly rich.\n\nThe Sain ridge rises to the north-west of the range bounding the Khi\u00e1rda D\u00fan; on the north, it stretches along the right bank of the river Giri, and has a massive contour, rising at its south-eastern extremity into the summit of Thandu Bhaw\u00e1n\u00ed (5700 feet); at its north-western, into that of Sarsu Debi (6299 feet). The formation is limestone, which extends generally to the bed of the Giri, where slate-rock commences. Beyond the Giri, and at the northern extremity of Sirmur, is the remarkable peak of Chor, connected by a transverse ridge with the outer Him\u00e1layas, and itself a central point from which subordinate ranges ramify in every direction. The summit is composed of tabular masses of granite, which, though compact, are readily decomposed by the weather.\n\nSirmur, though its rocks consist of formations usually metalliferous, at present yields little mineral wealth. At Kalsi, a copper-mine was formerly worked, but has now been abandoned. A lead-mine has\nalso been opened. Iron-ore is abundant, and the R\u00e1j\u00e1 established a foundry some years ago, and has made every endeavour to develop the natural resources of the State. Owing, however, to the difficulties of carriage from the mines, the enterprise has not hitherto proved a financial success. The extensive slate strata are in some places quarried to supply roofing. There is also a mine of mica.\n\nSo dense are the forests that the sportsman finds difficulty in making his way through them in search of wild elephants, tigers, leopards, bears, and hyenas, with which they abound. Wild pea-fowl are in many places very numerous, being unmolested in consequence of the superstitious regard of the natives.\n\n**History.**\u2014Sirmur, which means \u2018a crowned head,\u2019 was the place of residence of the R\u00e1j\u00e1s who ruled over the State before the present dynasty entered the country. It is said that the last R\u00e1j\u00e1 of the ancient line was swept away by a flood; and that Agar Sain R\u00e1wal, of the ruling family of Jaisalmer, from whom the present chief is descended, being at that time in the neighbourhood on a pilgrimage to the Ganges, took possession of the vacant throne. This occurred in 1895 A.D. The descendants of Agar Sain R\u00e1wal have retained the chiefship ever since.\n\nIn 1803 the country was brought into subjection by the G\u00farkhas, who in turn were expelled in 1815 by the British under Sir David Ochterlony. The R\u00e1jput R\u00e1j\u00e1 was reinstated in his ancient possessions, with the exception of the fort and pargan\u00e1 of Kut\u00e1ha or Gurhi, given to the Musalm\u00e1n sard\u00e1r of that place for good service against the enemy; the Khi\u00e1rda D\u00fan, which was subsequently, in 1833, restored; a tract of hill country to the north of the river Giri made over to the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Keunth\u00e1l; and the pargan\u00e1s of Jaunsar and Bawar in the Dehra D\u00fan, annexed to the British dominions.\n\nThe present R\u00e1j\u00e1, Shamsher Prak\u00e1sh, K.C.S.I., was born about 1843. He receives a salute of 11 guns, and maintains a small force of 55 cavalry, 300 infantry, with 10 field guns, and 20 artillerymen. The police force numbers 125 men. The relations of the chief with the British Government are defined in a sanad, dated 21st September 1815, under which he is required to consult the Superintendent of the Hill States in all matters connected with the management of the State, and to furnish a contingent to the British forces when called on. Sentences of death require the confirmation of the Superintendent and the Commissioner of Amb\u00e1la (Umballa), but all other punishments are awarded by the R\u00e1j\u00e1 on his own authority. The R\u00e1j\u00e1, who pays no tribute, enjoys an estimated revenue of \u00a321,000.\n\n**Population, etc.**\u2014No Census had ever been taken of the Punjab States prior to 1881, but in that year a regular enumeration of the people was conducted, on the same lines as in the British Districts. The following is a summary of the results as regards Sirmur State:\n\u2014Area, 1077 square miles; number of villages 2068, and town 1; houses, 26,872, of which 21,562 were occupied and 5310 unoccupied. Number of families, 23,181. Total population, 112,371, namely, males 63,305, and females 49,066; average density of population, 104 persons per square mile. Hindus numbered 107,634, or 95.8 per cent.; Muhammadans, 4240, or 3.7 per cent.; Sikhs, 468; Christians, 21; and Jains, 8.\n\nThe principal products are opium and several kinds of grain. Ginger is largely cultivated, and the State is famous for its fine breed of sheep. The houses are generally three storeys high; built of stone, boarded with timber, of which there is great abundance, as fine forests of fir, oak, rhododendron, horse-chestnut, and other trees overspread the mountains. The roofs are generally of slate, but sometimes of shingle. The family inhabits the upper storey, which is surrounded by an enclosed balcony projecting 6 or 8 feet beyond the wall. The villages, usually situated on the slopes or tops of hills, have a picturesque effect in the landscape. The natives of Sirmur are of the Aryan type, and obviously of a race allied to the Hindus of the plains; towards the northeast, there is an admixture of the Mongolian stock. Goitre is very prevalent amongst all classes. The dress of the middle classes consists of a simple tunic or frock reaching down to the knees, trousers, and a scarf usually worn across the shoulders, but when the sun is hot, thrown over the head; the lower orders content themselves with a blanket girt round the waist; the higher ranks dress after the fashion of Hindust\u00e1n, and wear the Sikh turban. The religion prevailing in Sirmur is mainly Hinduism; to which is added the superstitious adoration and dread of innumerable local divinities, with which the imagination of the people has peopled every hill, and valley, and grove. The lives of kine are sacred. The people are divided into castes as in the plains, and Br\u00e1hmins abound. The most important tribe in the hills is named Kanet, the members of which number 37,817, or 33.6 per cent. of the total population of the State. Kanets are Hindus, and probably of true Aryan descent. They are popularly supposed to be degenerate R\u00e1jputs, who have fallen from their high estate in consequence of the custom which prevails amongst them of purchasing their wives and allowing the marriage of widows. The language is a dialect of Hind\u00ed.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate of Sirmur varies with the elevation\u2014from that of the Chor, where the surface of the ground is under snow for the greater part of the year, to the stifling malaria of the low-lying Khi\u00e1rda D\u00fan. In shape, the Khi\u00e1rda D\u00fan resembles a deep narrow trench shut in by high walls on every side, except towards the east, where it opens to the Jumna; it has a deep alluvial swampy soil, teeming with rank vegetation; and its climate consequently is peculiarly\nhot and oppressive for about two months after the rains have ceased, and the air is charged with noxious vapours. The greater part of the D\u00fan is mere desert or jungle, untrodden by man, except by a few woodcutters, or by the collectors of gum catechu, which is yielded in great abundance by the Mimosa. Cultivation is, however, steadily spreading; and with the clearance of the jungle, the climate will approximate to that of the neighbouring Dehra D\u00fan.\n\nEND OF VOLUME XII.\n", "source":
