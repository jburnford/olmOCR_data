Read and confirmed Minutes of Meeting held on December 8, 1894.\n\n2. Mr. Harward said he gladly undertook the sad duty of proposing a vote of condolence on the death of Mr. George Wall, F.L.S., F.R.A.S., Vice-President. In proposing the vote he would read the following Minute passed by the Council:\n\n\"By the death of Mr. George Wall this Society has lost one of its oldest and most prominent Members. He joined the Society in 1858, and was a Vice-President from 1873 to the time of his death. He was a regular attendant at Meetings, and to the part which he took in its discussions the Proceedings of this Society owe much of their interest and value. At the same time Mr. Wall was taking a leading part in the political and mercantile life of the Island. It will be sufficient here to point to the fact that he was a Member of the Legislative Council in 1858-59 and 1863-64; Chairman of the Planters' Association, 1856-57, 1873, 1881, 1883-85; Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce from 1874 to 1879; a prominent Member of the Ceylon League during the years 1864-71; and Editor of the Ceylon Independent from December, 1888, to the time of his death.\n\n\"In all these positions he made his influence widely felt, and though there has been much controversy as to the measures which he advocated, his intellectual vigour and the generous and philanthropic character of his motives have won for him the respect of all parties and races in Ceylon.\n\n\"Mr. Wall's mind was as active as it was many-sided: neither politics or business impaired the freshness of his interest in all the literary and scientific questions of the day. He published no works on scientific subjects, but he was a Botanist of some reputation, a Fellow of the...\"\nLinnean Society, and an acknowledged authority on the Flora of Ceylon. He had read much on other branches of science, especially Astronomy, and in 1887 he delivered an address to this Society on Norman Lockyer's Theory of Meteorites.\n\n\"His literary work consisted mainly of pamphlets, letters, and contributions to newspapers. His other published works were the following:\u2014\"A Treatise on Good and Evil\"; \"The Natural History of Thought\"; and a series of letters on Revenue and Taxation reprinted from the Ceylon Observer in 1867.\n\n\"To the Journals of this Society he contributed four Papers on the history of the \"Ancient Industries of Ceylon,\" the first and second of which appear in Journal No. 37 of 1888, the third and fourth in Journal No. 42 of 1891.\"\n\nMr. J. Ferguson said it gave him a melancholy pleasure to comply with the request that he should second the Resolution. For the long period of well-nigh fifty years Mr. Wall had been a prominent colonist in Ceylon\u2014first as planter, next as merchant, and latterly as journalist; but always with a keen interest in all social and political questions that he conceived to be for the good of the community. He (Mr. Ferguson) might dwell on his regard for the welfare of the people and of \"the land we live in,\" because in these days of comparative prosperity and easy voyaging to and fro, European colonists are liable to become, unfortunately, more than ever birds of passage. Mr. Wall made Ceylon his home, and he exhibited before its people\u2014before them all\u2014a high example of strenuous continuous industry in following what he believed to be his duty. He might well have taken for his motto the words found in an old play, which run, \"Push on\u2014keep moving.\" So well did he (Mr. Wall) fill his time that even his relaxations were as other men's labours; and he (the speaker) had often thought that Mr. Wall might take to himself the saying attributed to the late Sir George Cornewall Lewis, Chancellor of the Exchequer, that \"Life would be endurable save for its pleasures.\" He need not say that there is no example so useful in a public man to place before an Eastern people as that of unflagging industry, and so Mr. Wall's half century out here afforded an object-lesson of great practical value. In respect of their Society, as they had heard from the Minute, Mr. Wall was a Member for the long period of thirty-six years, and had served on the Council and as Vice-President since 1873. In these capacities he always manifested great interest in the Proceedings, and did much useful work, notably through his contributions to the Journals in a series of Papers on \"Early Industries among the Natives.\" But it is Mr. Wall's personality as a whole that came before them, in thinking of him and of the loss the Society had sustained, and he very heartily seconded and supported the vote of condolence and sympathy proposed.\n\nThe Chairman then inquired if any other Member wished to address the Meeting, and as no one rose he put the motion to the Meeting:\u2014\n\n\"That the Ceylon Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society wishes to express its sympathy and condolence with the family of the late Mr. George Wall, Vice-President of the Society, and to express its sense of the loss which it has sustained by his death.\"\n\nThe motion was unanimously carried.\n3. Mr. Harward then read the Annual Report for 1894:\n\nANNUAL REPORT FOR 1894.\n\nThe Council of the Ceylon Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society have the honour to lay before this Meeting their Annual Report for 1894.\n\nMeetings.\n\nFour General Meetings of the Society were held during the year. The following Papers were read and discussed, viz.:\n\n(1) \"Some Notes on the Species and Varieties of Testudo in the Colombo Museum,\" by Mr. Amyrald Haly, Director of the Colombo Museum.\n\n(2) \"A Translation of a Sinhalese Inscription of 1745-46 A.D. engraved on an old cannon,\" by Mr. D. M. de Z. Wickremasinghe.\n\n(3) \"Kostantinu Hatana,\" by Mr. F. W. de Silva, Mudaliy\u00e1r.\n\n(4) \"Which Gaja B\u00e1hu visited India?\" by Mr. W. P. Ranasingha.\n\n(5) \"The Archaeology of the Wanni,\" by Mr. J. P. Lewis, c.c.s.\n\n(6) \"The Music of the Mechanics of Ceylon,\" by Mr. C. M. Fernando, B.A., LL.B.CANTAB., Advocate.\n\n(7) \"A Half-hour with two Ancient Tamil Poets,\" by the Hon. P. Coom\u00e1rasw\u00e1my.\n\nMembers.\n\nDuring the past year the following Resident Members were elected, viz.:\u2014The Rev. F. H. de Winton, Messrs. H. G. Bois, J. W. Maduwawala Rat\u00e9mahatmay\u00e1, J. E. Pohath, and Dr. W. H. de Silva.\n\nAt a General Meeting Mr. J. F. W. Gore was elected an Honorary Life Member under Rules 7 and 9, for the valuable service rendered by the preparation of an Index to the Journals and Proceedings of the Society.\n\nThe Council regret to have to record the loss by death of the following Members, viz.:\u2014Messrs. J. H. F. Hamilton, c.c.s.;* J. M. P. Peries, Mudaliy\u00e1r; and George Wall, F.L.S., F.R.A.S., Vice-President.\n\nLibrary.\n\nThe collection of books in the Library has been increased by the addition of 210 volumes, pamphlets, and periodicals. The acquisitions are chiefly exchanges received from other Societies.\n\nThe Library is indebted to the following donors for additions to its shelves, viz.:\u2014Drs. Paul and Fritz Sarasin; the Government of Madras; Secretary of State in Council for India; Mr. J. E. Sherard; the Government of Ceylon; the Rev. G. A. H. Arndt; the Trustees of the Indian Museum; Mr. W. Pereira; Dr. J. Burgess; the Committee of the Colombo Museum; the State Council of Ulwar; and Mr. J. B. Siebel.\n\nThe need of greater accommodation for the books is felt more than ever. The only means by which this can be obtained is by an extension of the Museum building. There is every prospect that this may be effected ere long.\n\n* Author of a Paper on \"Antiquities of Medamahanuwara,\" Journal No. 36, Vol. XI., 1888.\nCatalogue.\n\nA classified catalogue of the books in the Library was prepared under instructions from your Council and laid before them.\n\nIt was then pointed out by the Secretaries that it would be more advisable, both for the sake of reference and convenience, not to group titles of books under various sub-heads, but to have a Dictionary Catalogue under authors and subjects with cross references. After much discussion it was resolved that a new catalogue be drawn up on the lines of the Museum Catalogue. This is being prepared, and will shortly be submitted to the Council.\n\nIndex to Journals.\n\nThe Index to the Journals referred to in the Report for 1893 has been completed, and is at present going through the Press. This work will supply a long-felt want, and will add greatly to the value and utility of the Society's Journals. Its clearness and completeness reflect great credit on the author. The work consists of (1) Table of Contents with Pagination and Correction Tables; (2) General Index to the Journals; (3) Scientific Indices, Zoological and Botanical; (4) Index to the Proceedings and Appendices.\n\nThe Table of Contents is based on the list of the Society's Journals and Proceedings issued in 1891, and in it are entered the titles of all the essays which have appeared in the Journals, together with the names of their contributors.\n\nIn the General Index to the Journals entries are followed by three sets of figures; of these, the capital Roman figures refer to volumes, the bracketed figures denote part numbers, and the succeeding figures indicate the pages. The names of the authors of Papers, as quoted in the Table of Contents, are repeated in alphabetical order in the General Index, where also they are followed by the requisite numerical references. Particulars of the Papers contributed by each author may thus be ascertained by first referring to his name in the General Index, and then turning to the Table of Contents, wherein the titles of the Papers are likewise followed by reference numbers.\n\nIn the Scientific Indices the figures following the entries are arranged in the same manner as in the General Index. These indices are alphabetical arrangements of the Zoological and Botanical generic names occurring throughout the Journals.\n\nIn the Index to the Proceedings, &c., capital Roman figures refer to volumes as before, bracketed figures denote the dates of the proceedings, and the succeeding (small Roman) figures indicate the pages. Particulars of several essays and lectures not appearing in the Journals, as also the names of their authors, are entered in this Index.\n\nPublications.\n\nThe Society has issued during the year the following publications, viz.:\n\nI.\u2014Proceedings for 1889-90.\n\nII.\u2014Journal No. 41, Vol. XI., 1890, containing a translation from the Spanish, by Lieut.-Colonel H. H. St. George, with an Introduction by Mr. D. W. Ferguson, of \"The Rebellion of Ceylon, and the Progress of its Conquest under the Government of Costantino de S\u00e1 y Noro\u00f1a.\"\nIII.\u2014Journal No. 44, Vol. XIII., 1893, containing, in addition to the Proceedings of Council and General Meetings, the following Papers, viz.:\n\n(a) \"Notes on the Nidification of *Sturnornis Senex* (White-headed Starling) and *Cissa Ornata* (Ceylon Blue Jay),\" by Mr. F.

Modder.\n\nThe Journal of last year will be issued shortly.* Your Council is glad to be able to report that there are no arrears of publications to be issued.\n\nThe Society has to acknowledge its obligation to the Ceylon Government for allowing its publications to be printed at the Government Press, and its thanks are due to the Government Printer and his Assistants for their readiness to help the Society in the printing of their publications and for the care bestowed on the work.\n\nArchaeology.\n\nAs last year, the Council is indebted to the Archaeological Commissioner for a short r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the operations of the Archaeological Survey during 1894.\n\nFrom May onwards the work at Anur\u00e1dhapura was ably carried on by Mr. M. F. Maxfield, acting, as Assistant, under the Commissioner's written instructions, Mr. Bell himself having been recalled temporarily for additional duty elsewhere.\n\n*Abhayagiriya D\u00e1gaba.*\u2014To complete once for all the excavation of that quarter of the ancient city which was covered by the Abhayagiriya st\u00fapa and surrounding monasteries, attention at this point was exclusively directed to the d\u00e1gaba itself, the entire sweep of circumjacent ruins having been finished by the end of 1893.\n\nCommencing at the east, the stone-revettet mandapas, or porticos, at the four entrances to the outer quadrangle, were freed of the earth and trees which covered them, and their bold outlines restored as far as practicable\u2014neglect, vandalism, and destruction wrought by the roots of large trees having left little of the upper courses *in situ*.\n\nThe north mandapa had suffered least, and, as now rebuilt from steps to parapet, presents a strikingly handsome appearance, with its sharp-cut mouldings and graceful vase finials.\n\nSimultaneously the heavier work was steadily carried on of trenching round the base of the d\u00e1gaba and laying bare from the accumulation of brick d\u00e9bris, to a width of 10 ft. on either side, the four quartz projections\u2014so-called \"chapels\"\u2014at the cardinal points. From the\n\n* An advance copy was laid on the table.\neast to the west \"chapel\" the ground line of the d\u00e1gaba has been followed throughout (for some distance involving a deep cutting 8 ft. wide through the mass of fallen bricks) and the stone pavement on that side cleaned completely: along one quadrant\u2014the south-east\u2014excavation was carried back to the bell-shaped core of the d\u00e1gaba, so as to exhibit the three circular \"ambulatories,\" rising one above the other. Finally, the four \"chapels\" were partially restored\u2014that on the north in most substantial fashion. A true idea of the actual outline of the Abhayagiriya D\u00e1gaba, of its spacious quadrangle, and of the chaste carvings at its \"chapels,\" can now at length be gained.\n\nToluvila ruins.\u2014The ruins at Toluvila, near Nuwaravewa, have more than fulfilled the expectations formed in 1893. The felling of the undergrowth for a quarter of a mile around disclosed more and more buildings, and as excavations advanced southwards from the main quadrangle the extent of this magnificent monastery gradually unfolded itself.\n\nThe general plan of these ruins may be described curtly thus:\u2014On the north is a spacious raised quadrangle with four entrance porches and a ramp of cut stone supporting brick elephants in high relief. The square enclosure contains four shrines\u2014a pilima-g\u00e9 (image-house), d\u00e1gaba, wata-d\u00e1-g\u00e9 (circular relic shrine), and a vih\u00e1r\u00e9. From this quadrangle runs, for some 250 yards or more, a wide street between two low walls of dressed stone, passing over a plain smaller quadrangle and a peculiar star-shaped \"half-way house,\" until it reaches, on the south, another large quadrangle. This encloses a smaller square at a higher level, and that again a central vih\u00e1r\u00e9 raised still higher, with p\u00edrivenas (residences for monks) lying off its corners and beyond. On either side of this fine street are many other p\u00edrivenas, with connected buildings and outhouses laid out with wonderful symmetry. The whole of the trees on the street have been removed, root and branch, and the vista opened out from one main quadrangle to the other through the forest is as picturesque as it is unique. In several respects the Toluvila monastery stands unrivalled among the ruins of Anur\u00e1dhapura yet cleared and excavated.\n\nJ\u00e9tawan\u00e1r\u00e1ma ruins.\u2014In addition to the work done at Abhayagiriya D\u00e1gaba and Toluvila a commencement was made at the J\u00e9tawan\u00e1r\u00e1ma ruins. Here two distinct monasteries\u2014each complete in itself and within its own enclosure wall of stone slabs\u2014were excavated in the course of the year, the one a little north of the Kuttam pokunu (\"Twin ponds\"), and the other immediately adjoining the J\u00e9tawan\u00e1r\u00e1ma D\u00e1gaba, also on the north. Both monasteries are of considerable interest.\n\nCircuit Work.\u2014A circuit in the south-east and south-west K\u00f3ral\u00e9s of the North-Central Province was cut short by the Archaeological Commissioner's sudden transfer to Kalutara in April. The most interesting place visited was Elagomuva-kanda in the Kal\u00e1gam K\u00f3ral\u00e9, a small elongated hill pierced at its south end by several caves with inscriptions in the old cave character.\n\nMiscellaneous.\u2014At Anur\u00e1dhap\u00fara the four lower courses of the fine stone \"Buddhist Railing\" were set up, the cost being defrayed from a portion of the sum of Rs. 600 voted by this Society for the purpose. The work should be finished this year.\nIn the K\u00e9galla District the restoration of the elegantly carved basement of the Berendi Kovila at S\u00edtawaka was commenced, with a special Government grant of Rs. 500\u2014the fine stone \"lion pillar\" of Medagoda D\u00e9val\u00e9 secured for the Island Museum\u2014and surveys made of Beligala, and the st\u00fapas at Dedigama and Delivala.\n\nInscriptions.\u2014The reproduction in some reliable and permanent form of the numberless inscriptions of the Island has engaged the attention of the Government. The services of a native, trained under Dr. E. Hultzsch, were borrowed from the Madras Government for three months last year. During his stay and since upwards of 200 inscriptions have been copied in duplicate by the ink process, which has superseded every other in India.\n\nIt is hoped that the Archaeological Survey may ere long be in a position to commence the publication of an Epigraphia Zeylanica, on the lines of the Epigraphia Indica issued under the authority of the Indian Government.\n\nMeanwhile it is believed that the Archaeological Commissioner will endeavour to print, in his Progress Reports, the purport (and, where possible, provisional texts and translations) of inscriptions discovered in the course of his work.\n\nFinances.\n\nThe following is a statement of the income and expenditure of the Society for 1894:\n\n| Receipts | Rs. | c. |\n|----------|-----|----|\n| Balance in Bank of Madras | ... | 199 26 |\n| Entrance Fees and Subscriptions paid | ... | 582 25 |\n| Government Grant | ... | 500 0 |\n| Balance in Savings Bank | ... | 642 21 |\n\nTotal ... 1,923 72\n\n| Expenditure | Rs. | c. |\n|-------------|-----|----|\n| Clerk's Salary | ... | 240 0 |\n| Sundry charges, Stationery, Printing, Binding, &c. | ... | 387 94 |\n| Anur\u00e1dhapura Excavation Fund | ... | 300 0 |\n| Balance in Bank of Madras and cash | ... | 653 57 |\n| Balance in Savings Bank | ... | 342 21 |\n\nTotal ... 1,923 72\n\nA. P. Green,\nHonorary Treasurer.\n\nMr. P. Arun\u00e1chal\u00e1m, in moving the adoption of the Annual Report just read, said it was a record of good work done, and bore witness to the revival which the Society had undergone in recent years owing, in no little degree, to the zeal of the Vice-President (Mr. Swettenham), whose approaching departure from the Island was so keenly regretted. The finances of the Society appeared to be on a good footing; the number of Members had increased; its publications were up to date. The archaeological work in the \"buried cities\" of Ceylon\nhad been continued with vigour and ability by the Government Arch\u00e6ologist, Mr. Bell, whose most interesting Minute had been read. The literary and scientific activity of the Society was shown in the Papers read or published during the year, and in the preparation by Mr. Gore of a most valuable Index, which for the first time made the Journals of the Society available for easy reference and use. Mr. Haly continued his useful contributions on Zoology; Mr. Lewis on Arch\u00e6ology. Mr. Coom\u00e1rasw\u00e1my introduced to the Society's notice ancient Tamil poems, which, while valuable as classics, have fixed a much-needed landmark in the dreary region of Indian chronology, and his efforts in this direction were ably seconded by Mr. Ranasingha. Among other Papers one deserved special mention,\u2014Mr. C. M. Fernando's,\u2014on the Music of the Portuguese Mechanics of Ceylon, rather a new departure, which it was hoped would be persevered in by him as by other competent Members, and light thrown on the musical systems of the various races of the Island. The activity recorded in the Report was not unsatisfactory, considering the paucity of men in the Island who combined culture with leisure. Our educated men, who alone were able to help in the objects of the Society, were generally very busy professional men, and had little time or inclination for literary or scientific pursuits. It was a misfortune to themselves and to the community, but was almost inevitable in the present circumstances. It appeared to be partly an effect of modern civilization. Under the influence of this civilization, the more educated a man became the more his wants increased, the more comforts and luxuries he required, and he devoted all his time to making money in order to supply these increased needs of himself and his family. Simplicity of life thus disappeared as well as leisure. It was not a complaint peculiar to the Island; but owing to the smallness of our community and the absence of a class of hereditary wealth, or learning, the effect was rather marked here in the field of literary and scientific work. The combination of culture with simplicity of living was not uncommon both in the East and the West before the fever of modern civilization attacked us. That man would indeed be a benefactor of his race who showed this age how to combine the highest degree of culture with the greatest simplicity of life. Under the circumstances the Society might congratulate itself on the help it had received from its Members. He hoped, however, that in coming years still greater activity would be displayed, that the examples would be more generally followed of our much-deplored Vice-President, Mr. Wall, a record of whose political and literary activity during an eventful mercantile and journalistic career had been read to them that night; of our President, the Bishop of Colombo; and our Vice-President, Mr. Swettenham,\u2014who each found time from busy official and other work to devote to the efficient service of the Society; of Messrs. Coom\u00e1rasw\u00e1my and Ranasingha, whose literary zeal was not impeded by heavy professional work; and not least that of the hard-working Secretaries; and that the Society's Journals would be still further enriched with contributions which would continue to give it an honoured position among the learned Societies of the world.\n\nMr. Arun\u00e1chalam concluded by moving the adoption of the Report.\n\nMr. C. M. Fernando seconded, and expressed the hope that the activity and usefulness displayed by the Society during 1894 might continue, and be still further developed during the current year.\n\nThe Annual Report for 1894 was adopted unanimously.\n4. Mr. Arun\u00e1chal\u00e1m moved the election of the following Office-Bearers for 1895, nominated by the Council, viz.:\n\nPresident.\u2014The Right Rev. the Lord Bishop of Colombo.\n\nVice-Presidents.\u2014The Hon. Mr. Justice Lawrie and Mr. Staniforth Green.\n\nCouncil.\n\nHon. P. Coom\u00e1rasw\u00e1my. | Hon. P. R\u00e1man\u00e1than, C.M.G.\nMr. J. Ferguson. | Mr. W. P. Ranasingha\nMr. P.

Vandort.\n\nHonorary Treasurer.\u2014Mr. F. C. Roles.\n\nHonorary Secretaries.\u2014Mr. H. C. P. Bell, C.C.S.; Mr. J. Harward, M.A.; and Mr. G. A. Joseph.\n\nMr. H. Van Cuylenburg seconded.\u2014Carried unanimously.\n\n5. The Chairman then thanked the Members present for their attendance, and expressed the great satisfaction it gave him to occupy the chair even temporarily. The work of the Society was entirely up to date, and they had a complete Index\u2014a convenience which had never been attained before. The Report read for the past year was exceedingly satisfactory, and the Society had in a special manner to thank Mr. Gore for the Index, the Lord Bishop of Colombo for his deep interest, and last, but not least, the Honorary Secretaries, who had discharged their duties in an exceedingly painstaking and able way, ensuring any success achieved; and they could not as a Society be too thankful to them.\n\nFarewell to Mr. Swettenham.\n\nMr. P. Fre\u00fcdenberg said:\u2014\u201cI have been requested to propose a vote of thanks to the chair. As a rule this is a duty purely pleasant, though somewhat formal; but to-day, I am sorry to say, there is regret mingled with it. Our Vice-President, Mr. Swettenham, will not occupy this chair again for some time to come, whatever we may hope of a more distant future. We, the Ceylon Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, whilst congratulating Mr. Swettenham on his well-deserved promotion, cannot but regret that this promotion takes him away from this Island and this Society. For the full measure in which we recognize the great services Mr. Swettenham has rendered to us, as a scholarly gentleman who never grudged time and labour, in the same full measure do we realize the loss to us his departure entails. Under these circumstances, the vote of thanks to the chair ought to take the ampler form of our expressing to Mr. Swettenham our best thanks for all he has done for our Society, and our best wishes for his welfare in his future career.\u201d\n\nDr. W. G. Vandort said:\u2014\u201cI beg most cordially to second the vote of thanks just moved by Mr. Fre\u00fcdenberg to Mr. Swettenham, not only for presiding on this occasion with his usual kindness and ability, but also in view of his approaching departure from the Island, for the\nvaluable services he has rendered to the Society during the entire period of his connection with it. There is not a Member of the Society, I am sure, but must share with Mr. Fre\u00fcdenberg the regret he has expressed in losing even temporarily the services of so valuable a Member. Let us hope, however, that the separation will be but for a short time, and that when he comes back to us we shall be able to see him occupy the chair, not as Vice-President, but as our Vice-Patron, or it may be even as Patron *ex-officio.*\n\nThe Chairman (Mr. Swettenham) expressed his gratitude to the mover and seconder of the Resolution and to all present. He was aware that he was quite unworthy of the praise given him, but he appreciated their good wishes and the manner in which these had been expressed.\n\nThe proceedings then terminated.\nCOUNCIL MEETING.\n\nColombo Museum, May 16, 1895.\n\nPresent:\n\nThe Hon. P. Coom\u00e1rasw\u00e1my, in the Chair.\nMr. W. P. Ra\u1e47as\u00edgha. | Dr. W. G. Vandort.\nMr. J. Harward and Mr. G. A. Joseph, Honorary Secretaries.\n\nBusiness.\n\n1.

Gore, and in doing so stated that it was in connection with that work that the compiler had been made a Life Member of the Society.\n\n4. The Author read the following Paper:\u2014\nGLEANINGS FROM ANCIENT TAMIL LITERATURE.\n\nBy the Hon. P. Coom\u00e1rasw\u00e1my.\n\nI.\u2014PURAN\u00c1N\u00daRU.\n\nAs a contribution to the history of the ancient Tamils and their literature, I have prepared (I.) a list of the poets whose odes are contained in the Puran\u00e1n\u00faru, and (II.) a list of the persons to whom the odes were addressed.\n\nThe Puran\u00e1n\u00faru is a very interesting collection of four hundred short poems or odes by celebrated Tamil poets of ancient times. This anthology,* tradition says, was made by the Sangam of Madura.\n\nThe Sangam was a college or academy of literary men of eminence established by the P\u00e1ndiya kings. Mr. Casie Chitty observes in the Tamil Plutarch: \"these kings had three different Sangams established in their capital at three different periods, for the promotion of literature ..........and they made it a rule that every literary production should be submitted to their senatus academicus before it was allowed to circulate in the country.\" It is now difficult to say when the Sangam was first established, or to give the exact time it ceased to exist. In the commentary written by Nakk\u00edrar (a member of the Sangam in its last days), forming the greater part of the now existing commentary on Ir\u00e1iy\u00e1n\u00e1r's \"Akapporu!,\" an account of the three Sangams is given. Nakk\u00edrar was a contemporary\u2020 of the Cho\u1e37a king Karik\u00e1l\u00e1, who lived prior to the second century of the Christian era.\u2021 According to the ancient authorities there\n\n* See preface, p. 16, \"V\u00edrachol\u00edyam,\" Mr. Tam\u00f3tarampillai's edition; also p. 16 of his edition of \"Kalittokai.\"\n\n\u2020 Dr. Caldwell's introduction to his \"Grammar of the Dravidian Languages,\" second edition, p. 131.\n\n\u2021 Cf. my Paper, \"A Half-hour with two Ancient Tamil Poets,\" in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, Ceylon Branch, vol XIII., pp. 190-193.\nwere three* Sangams, known as the first, middle, and last. Amongst the members of the first Sangam were Agastiya, Mudinagarayyar of Muranjiyur, and others. And it is said to have lasted 4,440 years, during the reigns of eighty-nine P\u00e1ndiya kings, beginning with K\u00e1ysinavaluti and ending in the reign of Ka\u1e0dunkon, when the city of Madura\u2014not modern Madura, but another in the southernmost part of India\u2014was submerged in the sea. The number of authors whose works received the *imprimatur* of that Sangam was 4,449, including seven P\u00e1ndiya kings. The second Sangam was established by the P\u00e1ndiya king Vendoccheliyan\u2020 at Kap\u00e1dapuram, and ceased to exist when that city, the then capital of the P\u00e1ndiya kings, was also submerged in the sea during the reign of Mudattirumaran, having lasted 3,700 years, under fifty-nine different P\u00e1ndiya kings. Amongst its members were Tolk\u00e1ppiyan\u00e1r, Karunkoli, Mosi, K\u00edrantai, and others. The works of 3,700 persons, including five P\u00e1ndiya kings, were accepted by this Sangam. The only work of importance of the time of this Sangam which now exists is the \"Tolk\u00e1piyam,\" the celebrated treatise on Tamil grammar. The third and last Sangam was established by the P\u00e1ndiya king Mudattirumaran at Madura (modern Madura), which was called Uttara (Northern) Madurai, to distinguish it from Southern Madura, which was destroyed by the sea. Amongst its members were Sirumed\u00e1vi, Sentambh\u00fatan\u00e1r, Kil\u00e1r of Perumkundr\u00far, Marutan Ilan\u00e1gan\u00e1r, Nallanduvan\u00e1r, Nakk\u00edrar, Para\u1e47ar, Kapilar, Kall\u00e1dar, Sittalai S\u00e1ttan\u00e1r, and others. The works of 449 poets, including three P\u00e1ndiyas, were accepted by this Sangam, which existed for 1,850 years, during the reigns of forty-nine P\u00e1ndiyas, and ended either in the time of Ugrapperu Valuti or some time thereafter, that is to say, about the first century of the Christian era.\n\n* Cf. preface, \"V\u00edrachol\u00edyam\"; also Nakk\u00edrar, Nachchin\u00e1rkkiniy\u00e1r, the \u00c1siriyappa, in p. 3, footnote, in Chilappatik\u00e1ram, Uraip-p\u00e1yiram, and others.\n\n\u2020 The name is so given in Mr. Tam\u00f3tarampillai's edition of Iraiyan\u00e1r's Akapporu; but in the \u00c1siriyappa above mentioned it is given as Vend\u00e9rchcheliyan.\nI am aware that Dr. Caldwell says that the last days of the third Sangam, if it ever existed, should be placed in the thirteenth century.* But I think that those who have studied the results of Dr. Hultzsch's researches in South Indian Archaeology, as well as the ancient Tamil works which have been printed since the second edition of Dr. Caldwell's Grammar of the Dravidian Languages appeared, will see ample reason to doubt the correctness of the dates assigned by Dr. Caldwell to ancient Tamil authors and kings. I give a few instances in illustration of his erroneous conclusions.\n\nKarik\u00e1la, the Chola king, contemporary of Nakk\u00edrar, according to Dr. Caldwell lived in the thirteenth century. I have established that Karik\u00e1la lived prior to the second century.\u2020\n\nDr. Caldwell says that Jn\u00e1na Sambandha, Appar or Tirun\u00e1vukkarasu, and Sundara M\u00fartti, the three authors of \"Dev\u00e1ram,\" lived in the time of Sundara P\u00e1ndiya, who, he says reigned at the end of the thirteenth century. All these three authors are mentioned in an inscription of the time of the Chola king R\u00e1ja-r\u00e1ja Deva, which states that their images were worshipped in a certain temple (South Indian Inscriptions, vol. II., part II., p. 152), and R\u00e1ja-r\u00e1ja Deva's reign began in 1004 of the Christian era (South Indian Inscriptions, vol. I., p. 169). Mr. P. Sundaram Pillai, M.A. and Professor of Philosophy at the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja's College at Trivendrum, has shown in his essay \"On the Age of Jn\u00e1na Sambandha\" that Jn\u00e1na Sambandha's age must be placed prior to the seventh century. But there is perhaps reason for placing it even earlier,\u2014earlier than the second century. Those who are familiar with Tamil literature have read of one of the miracles performed by Jn\u00e1na Sambandha, viz., his raising to life a man of the Vaniga caste, who had died of\n\n* Dr. Caldwell's introduction to his \"Grammar of the Dravidian Languages,\" second edition, p. 131.\n\u2020 See Journal, Royal Asiatic Society, Ceylon Branch, vol.

This miracle is mentioned in the \"Tiruvilay\u0101dat Pur\u0101\u1e47am,\"* as also by Sekkil\u0101r in \"Periyapur\u0101\u1e47am,\" written in the eleventh century.\u2020 It is mentioned in two poems, the \"Tiruvant\u0101ti\" and \"Tiruvul\u00e1,\" on Jn\u0101na Sambandha, by Nambi And\u0101r Nambi, who lived in the tenth century; \u2020 it is also referred to by Jn\u0101na Sambandha's contemporary, Appar, as well as by Sundara M\u016brtti, in their \"Dev\u0101rams.\" Now this identical miracle is referred to in the Chilappatik\u0101ram, a poem of the second century, by Ka\u1e47\u1e47aki.\u2021 It may therefore be that Jn\u0101na Sambandha and his contemporary, Appar, lived prior to the second and not in the thirteenth century.\n\nI take this opportunity to state that I think I have been fortunate enough to identify the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0diyan king who was reconverted into Hind\u016bism by Jn\u0101na Sambandha from Jainism, and about whom Dr. Caldwell's work contains much erroneous writing\u2014the learned Bishop confounding him with a Sundara P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0diyan, \"Marco Polo's Sender Bandi,\" of the thirteenth century. Mr. Sundaram Pillai has established that the seventh century is the terminus ad quem of the time of Jn\u0101na Sambandha, and I have shown above that he may perhaps be placed prior to the second century. How then can the king whom he converted have lived in the thirteenth century? The right name of this king was Nedu\n\n---\n\n* Vanniyun Kinarum Ilipkamum Alaitta Padalam.\n\n\u2020 See \"Age of Jn\u0101na Sambandha\"; also Arumukha N\u0101valar's edition of the prose \"Periyapur\u0101\u1e47am,\" p. 9; and \"South Indian Inscriptions,\" vol.

This poem was written by the brother of the Chera king Senku\u1e6d\u1e6duvan in the second century. As to the authorship of this poem, see Chilappatik\u0101ram itself, as well as Ma\u1e47imekhalai, Arumpadavurai \u00c1siriyar, and Adiy\u0101rkkunall\u0101r; Chilappatik\u0101ram is cited by Nachchin\u0101rkkiniy\u0101r in his commentary on Tolk\u0101ppiyam. For the age of Ka\u1e47\u1e47aki, see remarks on Senku\u1e6d\u1e6duvan (who built a temple for her), in vol. XIII., R. A. S., Ceylon: my Paper on \"Chilappatik\u0101ram,\" pp. 81-84; Mr. Ranasi\u1e45ga's Paper, \"Which Gaja B\u00e1hu visited India?\" p. 144 et seq.; and \"A Half-hour with two Ancient Tamil Poets,\" p. 190 et seq. See also p. 36, infra.\nM\u00e1ran, and he is still worshipped as a saint under that name.* Nambi An\u1e0d\u00e1r Nambi mentions him: \u201cThe M\u00e1ran, conqueror of Nelveli, who formerly impaled the Jains whom Jn\u00e1na Sambandha overcame.\u201d\u2020 Sundara M\u00fartti says, \u201cI am the servant of the devotee, the righteous Ne\u1e0dum\u00e1ran, who conquered Nelveli.\u201d\u2021\n\nThe word Ne\u1e0dum\u00e1ran is convertible into Ne\u1e0duncheliyan, as M\u00e1ran and Cheliyan have the same signification, viz., P\u00e1\u1e47\u1e0diya. Ne\u1e0duncheliyan was a contemporary\u00a7 of Karik\u00e1la, and was the subject of poems by Nakk\u00edr\u00e1r and M\u00e1\u1e45kudi Marutan\u00e1r.\u2016 The latter calls him, \u201cO great king, who captured Nel-in-\u00far.\u201d\u00b6 Nel-in-\u00far means, \u00far the country, in of, nel paddy or rice. Nelveli means also the country of Nel,** and Nachchin\u00e1rkkiniy\u00e1r says that by Nel-in-\u00far is meant S\u00e1liy\u00far.\u2020\u2020 And there is only one P\u00e1\u1e47\u1e0diya in Tamil literature, who is styled the conqueror of Nelveli, or Nel-in-\u00far.\n\nIf my conjecture, that the terms Ne\u1e0dum\u00e1ran and Ne\u1e0dun-cheliyan denote the same P\u00e1\u1e47\u1e0diya king, be correct, then Jn\u00e1na Sambandha must have lived about the time when Jesus was born, when the throne of the Cholas was occupied by Karik\u00e1la, a conclusion which is supported by the fact that, judging from the Tamil literature of that period, this was the time when the Jain religion began to lose ground in Southern India.\n\nLet us come back, however, to Puran\u00e1\u1e47\u016bru. Amongst several collections or anthologies made by the Sangam is\n\n---\n\n* Cf. above quoted \u201cAge of Jn\u00e1na Sambandha.\u201d Also Periyapur\u00e1\u1e47am (Sad\u00e1sivappillai\u2019s edition, Madras, 1884), p. 246, v. 8, and p. 493.\n\u2020 Tirutton\u1e0dar Tiruvant\u00e1ti.\n\u2021 Tirutton\u1e0dattokai.\n\u00a7 Cf.

An ancient stanza, quoted both by Mr. Tam\u00f3tarampillai and Mr. Sw\u00e1min\u00e1tha Iyer,\u2020 gives the names of the \"eight anthologies,\" namely, *Nattrinai*, *Kuruntokai*, *Ainkurun\u016bru*, *Padittuppattu*, *Parip\u0101dal*, *Kalittokai*, *Akanan\u016bru*, and *Puranan\u016bru*. Of these only two have yet been printed: Kalittokai in 1887 and *Puranan\u016bru* in 1894.\n\nThe *Puranan\u016bru*\u2021 is cited by the great Tamil commentator Nachchin\u00e1rkkiniy\u00e1r in several of his commentaries. In the commentary on *Tolk\u00e1ppiyam* he cites it very often. Nachchin\u00e1rkkiniy\u00e1r, according to the author of the *Tamil Plutarch*, lived prior to the tenth century. Mr. Tam\u00f3tarampillai, to my thinking, more correctly places him before the eighth century. Parimela\u1e37akar, the commentator of the *Kural* and a contemporary of Nachchin\u00e1rkkiniy\u00e1r, also cites the *Puranan\u016bru*, and so does Adiy\u00e1rkkunall\u00e1r in his commentary on Chilappatik\u00e1ram. Sw\u00e1min\u00e1tha Iyer believes that Adiy\u00e1rkkunall\u00e1r lived prior to Nachchin\u00e1rkkiniy\u00e1r, but this is open to doubt.\n\nTherefore the tradition that this collection *Puranan\u016bru* was made by the Sangam of Madura is well founded.\n\nA series of short Papers under the heading \"Gleanings from Ancient Tamil Literature,\" which I shall from time to time contribute, will, I venture to think, convince the reader that all the poets and princes mentioned in the *Puranan\u016bru* flourished before the end of the second century of the Christian era. The proposed Papers will also give an account of whatever is known of the lives of some of these poets and their patrons.\n\n---\n\n* Cf. Kalittokai, p. 16, preface, for the names of all the collections.\n\n\u2020 Mr. C. W.

SENKU\u1e6cTUUVAN OF THE CHERA DYNASTY.\n\nOf the Chera kings of olden times, Senku\u1e6d\u1e6duuvan may be ranked among the most famous, not only by reason of his own greatness, but also as the grandson of the great Cho\u1e37a king Karik\u0101la, and, what is interesting to all Tamil scholars, as the brother of one of the most esteemed of Tamil poets.\n\nI shall endeavour to gather together whatever is said of Senku\u1e6d\u1e6duuvan in Tamil literature.\n\nThe Chera kingdom extended on the north to Pa\u1e37ani (the well-known sanitarium near Madura), on the east to Tenk\u0101si, on the south to the sea, and on the west to K\u014d\u1e37ikk\u016b\u1e0du (Calicut), and included within its limits modern Travancore. Its capital was Va\u00f1ji. The inhabitants of this kingdom were in those days both warlike and enterprising, presenting a striking contrast to their degenerate descendants. Their language then was Tamil.\n\nSenku\u1e6d\u1e6duuvan\u2019s father was Seral\u0101tan, who was called Kudakko Ne\u1e0dun Seral\u0101tan and Perum Seral\u0101tan. He, too\nwas a prince of great renown and martial spirit. One poet calls him \"Nedun Seral\u00e1tan of the ever-victorious banner, king of the Kudavars;\"* another refers to him as \"he who exercised sovereign power over the earth, even from Kum\u00e1ri (Cape Comorin) to the Him\u00e1layas in the north.\"\u2020 He married So\u1e47ai,\u2021 or Na\u1e6dsonai, daughter of Karik\u00e1la, and it is said that on one occasion she saved him from being drowned in the sea.\u00a7\n\nThe fact of his being the son-in-law of the great Ch\u00f3la did not prevent Seral\u00e1tan from engaging in battle with Karik\u00e1la, and, after his death, with his son and successor. The battle\n\n---\n\n* Para\u1e47ar in the Pad\u00edttuppattu.\n\n\u2020 Chilappatik\u00e1ram, V\u00e1ltuk\u00e1ta\u00ed: note the unusual use of \"orumoji\" in this chapter. Ordinarily it means \"one word,\" but here it is used to signify \"exercise of sovereign power,\" i.e., his one word prevailing over the region. Winslow, in his valuable Dictionary, does not give this meaning.\n\n\u2021 In the interesting chapter Indra Vil\u00e1veduttak\u00e1ta\u00ed in Chilappatik\u00e1ram, which contains a short account of Karik\u00e1la's capital and his doings, it is mentioned that he went to North India for purposes of conquest, and when there the King of Vajra N\u00e1du (Vajra country) presented him with a canopy of pearls, which was afterwards one of the wonders of Kav\u00e9ripp\u00fampa\u1e6d\u1e6dinam, the then capital of the Ch\u00f3las. The commentator says that the river Sona watered this country. This is the river now known as Son. Soane, or Sone. According to Hunter (\"Imperial Gazetteer of India\") it is said \"to be derived from the Sanskrit Sona, crimson, a great river of Central India, and (excluding the Jumna) the chief tributary of the Ganges on its right bank. It rises in 22\u00b0 41' N. latitude and 82\u00b0 7' E. longitude, flows in a generally northern direction ...... in 24\u00b0 5' N. latitude and 81\u00b0 6' E. longitude it is diverted to the east, and holds that direction in a tolerably straight course until it ultimately falls into the Ganges about ten miles above Din\u00e1pur ......... after a total length of about 465 miles.\"\n\nIt surely is not unlikely that, when his daughter was born, Karik\u00e1la gave her the name of this river in compliment to the king of Vajra, it being not unusual for Hind\u00fa females to bear the names of well-known rivers. I may here mention that Karik\u00e1la's capital, Kav\u00e9ripp\u00fampa\u1e6d\u1e6dinam, was partially destroyed by the sea during the reign of his successor or his successor, but before the death of Se\u1e45ku\u1e6d\u1e6duvan (see, amongst others, Ma\u1e47i-mekhalai, 25th K\u00e1tai). Cf. also pp. 192 and 193, vol. XIII., Journal, R. A. S., Ceylon.\n\n\u00a7 Vanjinam\u00e1lai, Chilappatik\u00e1ram.\nwith Karik\u00e1la took place at Ve\u1e47\u1e47il,* where Seral\u00e1tan was defeated and was obliged to flee to the \u201cNorth,\u201d\u2020 and he seems to have remained there for some time smarting under the defeat. The poet Kal\u00e1ttalaiy\u00e1r\u2021 addressed an ode to him on this occasion, advising his return to his kingdom:\n\nThe earth no longer hears the sound of the drum; the yal\u00a7 has forgotten its music; large pans are no longer filled with milk, nor is ghee\u00b6 made any more. The bees do not collect honey and the soil remains untilled. All gaiety has forsaken the broad streets of the cities. Like the sun who sets behind the hills when the moon rises, our king, covered with wounds inflicted by one who is his equal, has gone to the North with his sword. How sad are these days when I think of the past.\u201d\n\n* Battle of Ve\u1e47\u1e47il. In the poem \u201cPorunar\u00e1ttupp\u00e1dai\u201d the victory at Ve\u1e47\u1e47il is mentioned. (See Journal, R. A. S., C. B., vol. XIII., p. 200.) The defeat of the Chera king is also alluded to in \u201cPattinapp\u00e1lai\u201d thus: Kudav\u00e1r k\u00fampa, meaning that he made the inhabitants of the Chera kingdom \u201ctremble with fear.\u201d He seems to have also either in the same battle or afterwards defeated the great P\u00e1ndiya king Nedunch\u00e9liyan, who afterwards caused Kovalan\u2019s death (see \u201cChilappatik\u00e1ram\u201d). I think I may as well say why I have come to this conclusion. In \u201cPattinapp\u00e1lai\u201d it is stated that Karik\u00e1la defeated the P\u00e1ndiya who uttered the Vanjinam. The commentator Nachchin\u00e1rkkiniy\u00e1r refers to this Vanjinakk\u00e1nji (equivalent to a form of declaration of war), which is No. 72 in Puran\u00e1n\u016bru, recited by Nedunch\u00e9liyan. Nachchin\u00e1rkkiniy\u00e1r lived prior to the eighth century. (See p. 21, supra. In Chilappatik\u00e1ram, canto IV., Anti malaich-chirappuch-chey k\u00e1tai, occur these two lines with reference to the P\u00e1ndiya of the time:\n\nIlaiy\u00e1r\u00e1yiyum Pakaiyarasu kadiyu\u00f1 Cheruman-dennar.\n\nThat this refers to the same Nedunch\u00e9liyan who recited the Ode No. 72 in Puran\u00e1n\u016bru is, I think, clear, as the word \u201cIlaiyar\u201d in both places has special reference to the king\u2019s early years when he conquered his enemies.\n\n\u2020 Vadakku, \u201cNorth,\u201d where, it is not stated; but an eminent Tamil scholar whom I consulted says it may be Tiruppati, which has Vadamaralai as one of its names; or it may be the Ganges. Since writing this I find Vadatisaip-peyartal, \u201cgoing to the North,\u201d is explained (Chilappatik\u00e1ram, pp. 361, 362) as Ka\u1e45kaiadapp\u00f3tal, \u201cgoing to the Ganges to bathe in.\u201d\n\n\u2021 Puran\u00e1n\u016bru, Odes 65, 66.\n\n\u00a7 Yal, a musical instrument which for several hundred years has not been in existence.

The statement here will be understood when it is known that no religious ceremony of any importance can take place without ghee, nor is rice eaten without it.\nKarik\u00e1la's own poet, V\u00e9\u1e47\u1e47ik Kuyattiy\u00e1r,* commemorating the same battle, sang:\n\nO descendant of that warrior who, sailing his warship on the broad ocean, when becalmed, compelled the god of the winds to fill the sails! O, Karik\u00e1la, lord of mighty elephants, victorious in battle! Is he, who, when defeated at Ve\u1e47\u1e47il, fled to the North, at all your equal?\n\nSeral\u00e1tan came back to his kingdom and lived to fight Karik\u00e1la's son and successor, Perun\u00e1t Killi;\u2020 but this time the battle was disastrous, for both the princes met their death in the battle field.\n\nThe poet Para\u1e47ar bemoaned this event:\u2021\n\nMany an elephant, struck by arrows, has fallen, to fight no more; famous horses with their brave riders lie dead; warriors who came riding in great chariots have all fallen with their shields covering their faces; war-drums have ceased to sound, as no drummer is now alive. Alas! two kings pierced by arrows have lost their lives. Sunk in sorrow are those who people their fair lands.\n\nAfter the death\u00a7 of Seral\u00e1tan, his widowed queen, Sonai, was taken to the Ganges by her son Se\u1e47ku\u1e6d\u1e6duvan,\u2016 but whether she returned with him to Va\u1e47ji after this pilgrimage or spent her days on the banks of the Ganges, as is not unusual with Hind\u00fa widows, it is not possible to say.\n\nSeral\u00e1tan had two sons, Se\u1e47ku\u1e6d\u1e6duvan, who succeeded him on the throne of the Cheras, and Ilanko\u1e0dikal, who renounced the world, resided at Ku\u1e47avayil\u2014a town east of Va\u1e47ji\u2014and wrote the celebrated poem Chilappatik\u00e1ram.\n\nSe\u1e47ku\u1e6d\u1e6duvan married Ve\u1e47m\u00e1l, but whose daughter she was I have not been able to ascertain. After he ascended the throne he went, as already stated, with his mother on a pilgrimage to the Ganges, of which journey nothing is known. But he went again several years afterwards to Northern India, this time on a tour of conquest, of which some\n\n* Puran\u00e1n\u016bru, Odes 65, 66.\n\u2020 He is called Velpahradakkaip, Peruna\u1e6dkilli, and Peruviratkilli.\n\u2021 Puran\u00e1n\u016bru, Ode 63.\n\u00a7 Kal\u00e1ttalaiy\u00e1r has also left a poem on Seral\u00e1tan's death.\n\u2016 K\u00e1tcekk\u00e1ta\u00ed, Chilappatik\u00e1ram.\nparticulars may be gathered from *Chilappatik\u00e1ram*, as also other works\u2014*e.g.*, Para\u00f1ar in *Padittuppattu*, *Ma\u00f1imekhalai*; Nattattanar in *Sirup\u00e1\u00f1attuppada\u00ef*, &c.\n\nAccording to these, the king was one day informed by some pilgrims who had returned from North India, that the princes there stated that the Tamil kings of the day, unlike their warlike ancestors, had become effeminate. This so provoked him that he declared he would forthwith march to the North and conquer the princes who sneered at him, and compel them to carry on their heads stone from the Him\u00e1layas for fashioning the statue of the goddess Pattini to be placed in the temple which, at the request of his queen, he had determined to build. Orders were accordingly issued for the army to get ready, and the inhabitants of the country were informed by beat of drum of the king\u2019s intention. Thereupon the Royal Chaplain or Guru, accompanied by the ministers and commanders of the different sections of the army, waited on the king, who received them seated on his throne borne by sculptured lions. After the usual greetings they inquired what the king\u2019s pleasure was. The king replied: \u201cThe message of the \u00c1rya princes conveyed to us by the pilgrims shall not pass unchallenged; for otherwise disgrace will fall alike on all Tamil kings. If our sword do not compel these Northern princes to carry on their heads the stone intended for the statue of the goddess, then let it be our fate to suffer the pains and penalties which kings who oppress their subjects must suffer.\u201d All endeavour on the part of the priest and ministers to dissuade the king failed, and then the Court Astrologer, \u201clearned in the science treating of the twelve houses and the position of the planets and stars, and of the tithi, v\u00e1ram, yogam, and kara\u00f1am,\u201d rising, exclaimed with bowed head, \u201cMighty king, may your power be always great! the auspicious hour has arrived! If you start now on your journey all the great kings of the earth will become your servants.\u201d The king prepared to set out; the earth shook under the tread of the mighty host consisting of numberless\nhorse, foot, elephants, and chariots;* the welkin rang with the sound of the drum and other martial instruments, and the flags concealed the sky. Having first sent his sword and white umbrella, symbols of royalty, to the temple of Siva, he entered the Audience Hall and feasted the chiefs of his army. Then he proceeded to the temple, and after prayers he received his sword and umbrella and mounted his elephant. Here garlands and other offerings from the temple of Vish\u1e47u at \u00c1dakam\u00e1\u1e0dam, which the commentator interprets Tiruvanantapuram\u2014Trivendrum, now the capital of modern Travancore\u2014reached him. Leaving Va\u00f1ji amidst the prayers and blessings of his subjects, he marched to N\u012blagiri (modern Nilgiris), where he encamped and rested a while. Here some sages visited him, and asked his favour and protection on behalf of the Br\u0101hmans residing in and near the Him\u0101layas. Here also Konkanars, fierce K\u0101\u1e47\u1e6dhas, and others joined him. Sanjaya, with 100 great chariots, 500 elephants, 10,000 horse, and 500 military officers, also joined him. He said to Sanjaya, \u201cKanaka and Vijaya, sons of B\u0101lakum\u0101ra, having lost watch and ward over their tongues, have reviled me in the North, ignorant of the might of Tamil kings; this army therefore is on its march, nursing its wrath. Go ye forward and arrange for the collection of numerous boats to carry the army across the great river Ganges.\u201d\n\nAfter despatching Sanjaya and receiving the tributes sent by several princes, and suitably acknowledging them, he quitted N\u012blagiri and proceeded to the river Ganges, which he crossed. And after having been welcomed by the inhabitants, he proceeded further north and met in battle Kanaka and Vijaya and several other princes, whom he defeated after a fight lasting seven hours. He captured Kanaka, Vijaya, and several other princes and made them\n\n* This is the Chatur\u0101\u1e45ga, from which the game of chess is also called. The queen, castle, and bishop of the English game represent the minister, chariot, and elephant respectively in the Hind\u016b game.\nprisoners. He compelled the first two to change their royal garments for the religious mendicant garb (sanny\u0101si), and sent his prime minister, Villavankotai, with a military escort to the Him\u0101layas, from where a statue of the goddess Pattini was made and brought. He caused the two princes to carry it on their heads and returned to his capital with great spoils, after an absence of thirty-two months.* At Va\u00f1ji, it is needless to state, he was welcomed by his queen and subjects with great rejoicing. Then he sent Kanaka and Vijaya, still dressed as religious mendicants, in charge of his messengers, to be exhibited at the courts of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0diya\u1e47 and Ch\u014d\u1e37a kings, who however expressed their condemnation of the cruel treatment accorded to the unfortunate princes by Senkuttuvan.\u2020 When he heard this, the fiery king was for immediately declaring war, but was fortunately appeased by the Br\u0101hma\u1e47 M\u0101\u1e0dalan, whose spirited address on that occasion, somewhat abridged, runs thus:\u2014\n\n\"King of kings, may your power ever increase! You have conquered Viyal\u016br, you have defeated nine Ch\u014d\u1e37a princes,\n\n* Ena\u1e47ku matiyam Va\u00f1jinigkiyam. \"Chilappatik\u0101ram,\" p. 474.\n\n\u2020 Such, and worse ill treatment to conquered princes was not unusual in those times. There is extant a short poem written by the Chera prince Kanaihk\u0101l Irumporai, immediately before his suicide, complaining of the treatment he received at the hands of his conquerer, the Ch\u014d\u1e37a king Senkan\u1e47\u0101n (\"the Red-eye\"), which is quite pathetic: \"Even if a child is still-born, or the birth is a dead mass (embryo), even this is regarded as part of humanity and receives proper treatment. But when, though a prince, my only fault has been misfortune in war, instead of being beheaded, alas! that I should be chained like a dog and treated cruelly, even a drink of water being refused; surely I have enough self-respect and courage left to commit suicide without seeking to appease hunger and thirst at the hands of strangers who pity my state!\"\n\nThe Senkan\u1e47\u0101n here mentioned is Ko-Senkan\u1e47\u0101n of Dr. Hultzsch (South Indian Inscriptions, vol. II., p. 153), whose name is mentioned in copperplate grants as ancestor of Vijay\u0101laya, who reigned circa 875 anno Christi (South Indian Journal, vol. I., p. 112). Jn\u0101na Sambandha, in his Dev\u0101rams, mentions him in more than one of his hymns. So does Aupar (Tirun\u0101vukkarasu), his contemporary, as also Sundaram\u016brtti. Jn\u0101na Sambandha lived prior to the second century of the Christian era. Cf. pp. 19, 20, 21, supra.\nthe enemies of your cousin,* and you have now conquered \u00c1rya princes. Is your warlike spirit not content? May you live as many years as there are grains of sand on the banks of your beloved river Poru\u1e47ai. But will one's life be everlasting? It is well within your own knowledge how soon youth passes away, since your hair is gray and you are getting old and infirm. And yet without desiring to walk in the path of \u0100ram (the law) you are still intent on the path of M\u0101ram \u2020 (darkness). Cease then your anger and perform, with your queen, the R\u00e1ja S\u00fayay\u00e1gap\u2021 without delay.\u201d\n\nThereupon the king released the \u00c1rya princes, and desired his minister Villavankotai to treat them as befitted their rank until the forthcoming religious ceremonies were over, and to send them back to their country. He gave directions for the construction of a temple to the goddess Pattini,\u00a7 and on its completion was present at its consecration, together with Kanaka and Vijaya, the \u00c1rya princes, and Konkar and M\u00e1\u1e37wa and other princes, and Gaja B\u00e1hu, \u201cking of sea-girt Ceylon.\u201d\n\nIn my Paper on \u201cChilappatik\u00e1ram\u201d I stated that the Gaja B\u00e1hu referred to was Gaja B\u00e1hu I., who reigned in Ceylon between 113\u2013135 of the years of Christ.

This battle with the Chola princes took place at Neriv\u00e1yil, after the conquest of Viyal\u00far; see pp. 473, 474, 481, \u201cChilappatik\u00e1ram.\u201d The defeat and death of the nine Chola princes is also mentioned in Padittuppattu V.:\n\nArach-cheruvit ch\u00f3l\u0101r kudikkuriy\u00f3\u1e5b\nOnpatinpar U\u00edlav\u00e1yit pu\u1e6d\u1e6dattiruttu.\n\n\u2020 There is an old proverb which Appar, alias Tirun\u00e1vukkarasu, contemporary of Jn\u00e1na Sambandhar, mentions in one of his Dev\u00e1rams:\n\nAramirukka m\u0101ram vilaikkuk-kondava\u1e5b\u00e9.\n\n\u201cWhen Aram is to be acquired easily, how foolish to seek Maram with one\u2019s best efforts.\u201d Adiy\u00e1rkkunall\u00e1r gives Sanskrit hita and ahita as equivalents of aram and raram respectively.\n\n\u2021 A religious sacrifice or ceremony performed by a supreme sovereign.\n\n\u00a7 I.e., Ka\u1e47\u1e47aki, wife of Kovalan, who lost his life at Madura.

Mr. E. S. W. Sen\u0101thi R\u0101j\u0101 said:\u2014\n\nThe Paper that has just been read is one of special interest, I need hardly say, to Tamils. The long list of poets and the long series of years during which the Sangam lasted, as given in the Paper, are no doubt based on tradition. But the antiquity of Tamil literature does not depend on tradition alone. It may be inferred from the evidence furnished by the Tamil literature itself, as well as from evidence derived from other sources. Not to be tedious, I will give only one instance of each.\n\nIt is well known that the classical literature of the Tamils has been written in a dialect called Sentamil, which is almost unintelligible to an illiterate Tamil man. The oldest grammar that has come down to the present day in that dialect is called Tolk\u0101ppiyam. Tolk\u0101ppiyam itself is not the most ancient work of its kind, for it appeals to the authority of still older writers. Two books of Tolk\u0101ppiyam have come down to us, and there are four different classical commentaries on it. Tolk\u0101ppiyam on the face of it purports to be modelled on the Aindra Vy\u0101kara\u1e47a, or the grammar of Indra, the oldest of the eight schools of Sanskrit grammarians. How ancient the system of Aindra Vy\u0101kara\u1e47a is may be gathered from the fact that it is the system which is adopted in the Pr\u0101t\u012bch\u0101khyas of the Rig-Veda. The division of letters into uyir (vowels) and mey (consonants), literally \"life\" and \"body,\" and the division of vowels into kuril (short) and nedil (long) in the Tolk\u0101ppiyam, corresponds to the division into svra, sparca, hrasva, and dirgha, respectively, of the Rig-Veda Pr\u0101t\u012bch\u0101khyas. The classification of parts of speech into four, in the Tolk\u0101ppiyam, as peyar (noun), vinai (verb), idai (middle word), and uri (qualifying word), is identical with the terms n\u0101man, \u0101khy\u0101ta, upasarga, and nip\u0101ta of the Vedic grammarian. Similarly, the division of words into pagupadam (divisible) and pag\u0101ppadam (indivisible) in the Tolk\u0101ppiyam is equivalent to the ingyapada and aningyapada of the Rig-Veda Pr\u0101t\u012bch\u0101khyas. Again, the distribution of tenses into nigal-poludu (present), iranda-poludu (past), and edir-poludu (future) corresponds to the vartam\u0101na k\u0101la, par\u014dx\u0101 k\u0101la, and bh\u0101vishyat k\u0101la of the Vedic grammarian. In fact, the whole grammatical arrangement is that of the Rig-Veda Pr\u0101t\u012bch\u0101khyas, and the terminology is a literal translation from Sanskrit. Now, if we turn from the Rig-Veda Pr\u0101t\u012bch\u0101khyas and the Aindra Vy\u0101kara\u1e47a to the work of P\u0101\u1e47ini, the prince of Sanskrit\n\n* Chilappatik\u0101ram, Na\u1e0dukatk\u0101tai. The passage may perhaps also mean that he had lived fifty years.\n\n\u2020 Cf. Journal, R. A. S., Ceylon, vol. XIII., p. 81 et seq.; Mr. R\u0101nas\u012bgha's Paper, p. 144 et seq.; also page 191, where the age of Karik\u0101la, Senku\u1e6d\u1e6duvan's grandfather, is discussed.\ngrammarians, it will be seen that his system is entirely different from that of the Rig-Veda Pr\u0101t\u012bch\u0101khyas. The more scientific and refined grammatical analysis of P\u0101\u1e47ini and his technicalities will show that he lived in a later age, when the science of grammar was far more advanced. For more than 2,000 years the P\u0101\u1e47iniyam has been admired throughout India as a masterpiece revealed by divine grace. The argument which I would draw from this is, that the Tamil grammarian, when he deliberately set himself to model a system of Tamil grammar on a Sanskrit prototype, would undoubtedly have followed the unrivalled work of P\u0101\u1e47ini in preference to the Aindra Vy\u0101karana, if the work of P\u0101\u1e47ini had been known in his time. The obvious inference is that the first Tamil grammarian, whether it be Agattiyar or Tolkappiyar who introduced the Aindra Vy\u0101karana system from Sanskrit into Tamil, lived prior to the age of P\u0101\u1e47ini. So much for internal evidence.\n\nAs for external evidence, I will give one instance. According to the Mah\u0101vamsa the celebrated teacher Anando, \u201cwho was a rallying point, like a standard, to Tambapanni,\u201d had a disciple called Dipankaro. This latter (who was apparently a Tamil) had obtained great renown for learning in the land of the Tamils, and was the superintendent of two religious houses there. It was he who composed \u201cthe perfect Rup\u0101-Siddhi.\u201d The oldest compilation from Kachchayana\u2019s grammar, according to Mr. Turnour, the translator of the Mah\u0101vamsa, is acknowledged to be the Rup\u0101-Siddhi. It seems, therefore, that even in the early days of Buddhism the study of the science of grammar was prosecuted in the land of the Tamils.\n\nI also agree with my honourable friend, the author of the Paper, in thinking that the generally received chronology of Tamil literature borrowed from Dr. Caldwell\u2019s Comparative Grammar of the Dravidian Languages is very erroneous. In fact, the venerable author of the Comparative Grammar had not sufficient materials before him at the time he composed his work to draw up a correct chronology. Such materials are, I fear, insufficient even now. I will give one instance among many of the errors of Dr. Caldwell.\n\nAccording to Dr. Caldwell, the well-known Tamil work called M\u016bdurai was composed after the arrival of Europeans in India. The only reason given for this startling statement is that the word v\u0101n-k\u014dli occurs in one of the stanzas; and the word v\u0101n-k\u014dli, according to Dr. Caldwell, means \u201cturkey,\u201d and as the turkey was introduced into Europe from the New World after its discovery in the fifteenth century, it must have been imported into India by Europeans. But it seems to me that the translation of Dr. Caldwell of the word v\u0101n-k\u014dli into \u201cturkey\u201d is wrong. No doubt popularly the turkey is called v\u0101n-k\u014dli. But in classical Tamil v\u0101n-k\u014dli does not mean the turkey. It is applied to wild fowls, which are abundant in the forests of India and Ceylon even at present. The word v\u0101n in classical Tamil means \u201cwild,\u201d \u201cuncultivated,\u201d and occurs in combination with other words. Thus we meet with the combination v\u0101n-payir, which means a \u201cplant which grows wild,\u201d or which requires no special cultivation. To draw a conclusion about the date of an author from one single word, the meaning of which has been misconceived, is, to say the least, very misguiding.\n\nWhile I am perfectly in accord with the author of the Paper in admitting that the Tamils had a literature from very ancient times, I\nmust confess that the argument by which he tries to establish the age of Sambandha does not, to my mind, seem quite conclusive. Mere semblance or identity of names cannot go for much. Among the Tamils it is not unusual for a grandson or other descendant to take the name of his ancestor. Such evidence as is based on mere identification of names must be corroborated by evidence from other sources, before it can be accepted as conclusive. I may mention one difficulty (among others) which has suggested itself to my mind, by the period in which my honourable friend, the author of the Paper, places Sambandha. If Sambandha, the Saiva reformer, and his colleagues lived about the time when Jesus Christ lived, the Jains and Buddhists, according to all received accounts, must have been exterminated from the Tamil country at that time. Sambandha and his colleagues carried on a crusade against those heretics from one Tamil kingdom to another. But according to the Chinese traveller Hwen Thsang, who visited Southern India about the early part of the seventh century, there were a great many Buddhists and Buddhist temples in Southern India, and he also states that Nigrantha Jains were numerous. If Jainism had been so completely overthrown by Sambandha and his colleagues in the first century, it is improbable that the Jains should have been numerous in the early part of the seventh. I do not say that it is impossible. There might have been a Jain revival. But there must be facts to support such an inference. All that I wish to say is that we should carry a judicial frame of mind into inquiries of this kind.\n\nMy honourable friend would have done a signal service to the Society if he had placed before the Society a translation of the work on which he has written a Paper. In that case the Members of the Society could draw their own conclusions from facts, instead of depending on his *ipse dixit*, however sound. As a lawyer, he must know, that if he wishes to prove any facts contained in a document, the best way of proving them is by the production of the document itself. I make these remarks in no unfriendly spirit: it is a pleasure to me to see him devote himself to such studies. But I trust that when he gives us his next Paper he will also give us the benefit of having the original of the work on which his Paper is based, with a translation into English.\n\nMessrs. J. Harward and F. C. Roles also made a few observations on the Paper.\n\nMr. C. M. Fernando said that the Papers that had been read were in every way worthy of the Asiatic Society, and had this additional merit, that they supplied ample material for discussion. He could assure Mr. Coomaraswamy that he brought a perfectly impartial mind to bear upon that discussion, and he would venture to say a few words which were suggested to him by a remark from the Chairman. He was sure the Chairman did not imply the meaning which his words seemed to convey, that Sanskrit and Tamil were the only forms of Oriental literature worth study. The Sinhalese people could, in spite of the depredations so systematically committed by the Tamil invaders of Ceylon, boast of a literature which would compare favourably with Tamil literature. With reference to a statement in the first Paper, that some of the P\u00e1ndiyan kings were literary men of a high order, he would remind them that it was equally so in Sinhalese history. The great Par\u00e1kr\u00e1ma, to whom some of the Indian kingdoms paid tribute, was an accomplished linguist and writer. One of the finest poems\nin Sinhalese, the Kavsilumina, was the work of King P\u00e2ndita Par\u00e1krama B\u00e1hu, and coming to a more modern period one is reminded of the Buddhist legendary poem, the Asadrisa J\u00e1taka, from the pen of King Rajadi R\u00e1jasiyha of Kandy.\n\nMr. Coom\u00e1rasw\u00e1my in reply said:\u2014It must be borne in mind that in giving an account of the Sangam from ancient Tamil works, I do not commit myself to any opinion with regard to it except as to the time when it ceased to exist, which I believe to be about the first century of the Christian era. There can be no doubt that Tolk\u00e1ppiyam is very old, but I cannot agree with Mr. Sen\u00e1thi R\u00e1j\u00e1 that it is modelled after any Sanskrit grammar. I believe it to be quite independent of Sanskrit, and that it is based on a purely Tamil system as it existed in previous treatises which are not extant now.\n\nThe present occasion is not the time to discuss the age of Jn\u00e1na Sambandha. I would refer those who take an interest in the matter to the essay on the subject by Mr. Sundaram Pillai, a copy of which is in our Library.\n\nI agree with Mr. Sen\u00e1thi R\u00e1j\u00e1 that an English translation of the Tamil works referred to in my Paper just read would be very interesting, but such an undertaking is quite unnecessary for the purposes of my Paper. I have merely to cite\u2014as I have cited\u2014my authority, and readers can easily verify them.\n\nDr. W. G. Vandort regretted his ignorance of Tamilliterature prevented him from making any observations on the Paper which would be acceptable to the Society; but referring to the remarks of the previous speaker, who claimed for the antiquity of Tamil poetic literature evidence of a superior character, he trusted that such evidence would be found of a more reliable kind than that adduced that evening by the Hon. Mr. Coom\u00e1rasw\u00e1my in support of the three Sangams. For instance, the extraordinary coincidence in point of number between the poets accepted by each Sangam, and the number of years assigned to the same Sangam, was suspicious, to say the least of it. Again, the average period of government assigned to each of the P\u00e1ndiyan sovereigns, fifty years and more, was simply incredible, and savoured of the usual mystic and legendary character peculiar to traditional evidence.\n\n6. A vote of thanks was accorded to the writer of the Papers (Mr. Coom\u00e1rasw\u00e1my), on a motion proposed by Mr. P. R\u00e1man\u00e1than and seconded by Mr. C. M. Fernando.\n\nMr. Coom\u00e1rasw\u00e1my replied, acknowledging the vote of thanks.\n\n7. A vote of thanks to the Chair, proposed by Mr. Sen\u00e1thi R\u00e1j\u00e1 and seconded by Mr. Harward, terminated the proceedings of the meeting.\nCOUNCIL MEETING.\n\nColombo Museum, August 6, 1895.\n\nPresent:\n\nMr. J.

Laid on the table:\u2014\n\n(a) A letter from Mr. Advocate Brito offering certain remarks on the Papers \"Chilappatik\u00e1ram\" and \"Which Gaja B\u00e1hu visited India?\" Referred to Mr. S. G. Lee and the Hon. A. de A. Seneviratna.\n\nResolved,\u2014That the Secretaries do write to Mr. Brito to the following effect, viz.:\u2014That as the larger manuscript Paper referred to by Mr. Brito is not before the Council, and as it is stated by him that it consists of 300 pages and is unsuited for delivery in the form of a lecture or lectures, and can only be studied as a whole, and is only intended for the specialist, the Council cannot express any opinion on the conclusions at which he has arrived. But they take this opportunity of thanking him for laying the particulars before them, and of expressing their sympathy with his researches. As they infer that he intends to print his manuscript, they feel that the questions raised by him can be better considered when it has been so brought before the public.\n(b) Paper entitled \"How the last King of Kandy was captured by the British,\" by Mr. T.

W. Rhys Davids, late of the Ceylon Civil Service (R. A. S. Journal, vol. VII., art X., 1875).\n\n(3) On the Ruins of Sigiri in Ceylon, by T. H. Blakesley, Public Works Department, Ceylon (R. A. S. Journal, N. S., vol. VIII., art. II., 1876).\n\n(4) The Fortress Rock of Sigiriya, and its Ancient Frescoes, by A. Murray, Public Works Department, Ceylon. (Manuscript Paper: extracts printed in \"Black and White,\" No. 189, 1891.)\u2020\n\n2. \"Some systematic examination of the interesting remains at Sigiriya\"\u2014to quote from the Message to Council of His Excellency the Governor Sir A. H. Gordon, November 20\u2014was first specially contemplated in 1889.\n\n3. In 1893 the Archaeological Commissioner received definite orders from the Government to commence in 1894, and carry to completion the survey of either Sigiriya, in the Central Province, or Y\u00e1pahuwa, in the North-Western Province. \u2021 I selected Sigiriya as of higher antiquity and distinctly greater interest.\n\n* In illustration of the Report, plans, architectural drawings, and views of the Rock and its surroundings, done by the Archaeological Survey, were exhibited in the room; also an album of photographs taken by the Archaeological Commissioner.\n\n\u2020 Reprinted in the Ceylon Literary Register, 1891, vol. II., p. 85.\n\n\u2021 Letter from the Hon. the Colonial Secretary to the Archaeological Commissioner, September 13, 1893.\n4. A first hurried visit had been made to Sigiriya on June 22, 1893.*\n\n5. Subsequently correspondence was started with the Public Works Department to secure, by the early months of 1894, the erection of iron ladders and an iron hand-rail,\u2014an essential preliminary to carrying on operations on the summit of the Rock with safety.\u2020\n\n6. Owing to change of Public Works Department officers and other causes, protracted delay ensued, despite reiterated protests; the only suitable season for work passed; and not until the end of 1894 were the iron ladders, &c., fixed in position.\u2021 Thus a whole year was lost.\n\n7. Meanwhile, on April 15, 1894, I again visited Sigiriya and made an ascent by the jungle-wood ladders, and 6-in. rock grooves beyond, to the top of the Rock, with a view of gaining some notion of the probable amount of work to be done on the summit.\u00a7\n\n8. The summit of the Rock was then (April, 1894) covered with forest trees and a dense undergrowth, neck high. This, with the undulations of the ground and free outcrop of brick, satisfied me that the clearing of the timber and scrub, and thorough excavation of the mounds of d\u00e9bris, would entail heavy labour.\n\n9. In August, 1894, my Assistant (Mr. M. F. Maxfield), acting on written directions from Kalutara,|| employed a gang of Sinhalese villagers to fell and burn the trees on the top of the Rock, as well as close round the base of the western and southern scarps. Nothing more could be done in 1894.\n\n* Album, C 178\u2013183.\n\u2020 Copies of the correspondence were forwarded to Government.\n\u2021 To guard against all possibility of accident during the continuance of work in 1895 the iron hand-rail was supplemented, by order of the Archaeological Commissioner, with upright and cross fence-sticks. (Album, C 474.)\n\u00a7 Album, C 362\u2013370. This was the last of some half dozen ascents to the summit made by Europeans prior to the fixing of the iron ladders and hand-rail. The rock was first ascended by a lady on April 14, 1895.\n|| Mr. Bell acted as District Judge, Kalutara, whilst also directing Archaeological Survey operations, between May 1 and December 7, 1894.\n10. A third visit to Sigiriya in January of this year, in company with Mr. G. S. Saxton, Assistant Government Agent, Matale, enabled me to select sites for the immediate erection of temporary \"cooly lines\" and huts (wattle, leaf, and thatch) for overseers and labourers of the Archaeological Survey. The \"lines\" were built between the south end of the Rock slope and the tank: the rice and tool store and tent of the Archaeological Commissioner placed on a plateau a hundred yards from the \"gallery.\"\n\n11. Tamil labour\u2014the Sinhalese cannot, or will not, dig\u2014is not obtainable locally. There was, therefore, no alternative but to move a force from Anuradhapura to Sigiriya. This I succeeded in doing, not without considerable difficulty, due to the place having a bad name from its forest seclusion, the dread presence of countless yakku or pisachikal (demons), the unwholesome tank water, and the scarcity of food. The latter objection I partially overcame by arranging for advances of rice and cocoanuts, in addition to a slightly enhanced rate of wages.\n\n12. Finally, on February 24 a force of 37 men and boys left Anuradhapura for Sigiriya under my Head Overseer. This inadequate gang was gradually raised by irregular drafts to 75, but the total strength continued to fluctuate owing to sudden and unavoidable \"disappearances.\"\n\n13. I joined the labour force on March 5 and remained in personal charge of operations until May 12, when the season's work had to be closed, strong winds and generally inclement weather having set in.\n\n14. The weather broke on April 26 with a succession of very heavy thunderstorms followed by gusty days, which gradually ushered in the high wind that on the Rock's summit resembles a gale.\n\n15. The health of the coolies during the two and a half months they were at Sigiriya was on the whole good. A few cases of fever and dysentery in a mild form were the chief ailments, next to sores\u2014a real plague. Since their\nreturn to Anur\u00e1dhapura many of the coolies have been incapacitated for work from a crop of ulcerated sores, undoubtedly traceable to the bad tank water at S\u00edgiriya.\n\n16. The whole force\u2014a strange and remarkably unpleasant experience\u2014was for quite a fortnight harassed by the bambaru, or rock-bees,* whose hives line the cliff. These aggressive little pests (with a sting considered almost as severe as that of the debor\u00e1, or hornet)\u2020 lay in wait for the approach of the coolies, and more than once, suo more, literally chased them down to their lines, inflicting stings that half blinded some of the men and laid them up for days together.\u2021 Hardly one escaped, and work on the summit had to be temporarily suspended. After several ineffectual attempts to destroy the hives by riddling them with shot and ball, we at last succeeded by slow-burning fire balls (Sinhalese, vedi dodan) in burning them out from their main hive a hundred feet or more up the west cliff. The rest of the bees then gave comparatively little annoyance.\n\n17. Briefly, the work done at S\u00edgiriya by the Archaeological Survey during the season of 1895 comprised:\n\n(1) Clearing of trees and undergrowth (a) on the summit, half done in 1894; (b) below the Rock, within the outer bemma, or rampart, of the ancient nuwara (city).\n\n(2) Excavations (a) on the summit; (b) below.\n\n(3) Other work.\n\n(4) Detailed measuring up and drawing the walls, steps, &c., laid bare by axe and spade.\n\n18. Full plans, &c., are reserved for my Annual Report. The following, forwarded with this preliminary report, will give a good general idea of the nature and amount of work carried out:\n\n* Vespa cineta or affinis. \u2020 Eumenes petiolata.\n\n\u2021 Tennent (Ceylon, I. 258) commits himself as follows:\u2014\"I have never heard of an instance of persons being attacked by the bees of Ceylon, and hence the natives assert, that those most productive of honey are destitute of stings.\"\n(A) Plan of Sigiri Nuwara (adapted from Mr. Blakesley's Plan).\n\n(B) Survey Plan of the summit of Sigiri-gala (made by the Archaeological Survey), showing the terraces, &c., and the excavations completed in 1895.\n\n(C) Elevation Drawing (sample) of one mound and trench on the summit.\n\n(D) Photographs taken at Sigiriya.*\n\n(1) CLEARING.\n\n19. (a) On the Summit.\u2014The numerous trees felled in August, 1894, had to be cut up, thrown over the Rock, or burnt, and a tangled growth of m\u00e1na grass\u2020 and creepers removed. This work alone occupied a fortnight.\n\n20. (b) Below the Rock.\u2014Starting from the south-west corner of the Rock and working northward down the steep terraced slopes, the undergrowth\u2014in places thorny and close\u2014was gradually swept as far as the mah\u00e1 b\u00ebmma, or great ramp, the path to Pidur\u00e1gala being kept as the western limit at first, and subsequently the Talkot\u00e9 village path. The area embraced covers roughly half a mile by one-third.\u2021 It is strewn with scores of boulders, large and small, marked by grooves and mortice holes innumerable, that formerly held walls and pillars of the city buildings. All clearing was done by Sinhalese labour.\n\n21. As will be seen on reference to Plan (A), there remains to be cleared the area west and south-west of the Talkot\u00e9 path up to the mah\u00e1 b\u00ebmma, and an unknown extent round the north and east sides of the Rock, to say nothing of the jungle along the huge stone embankment stretching south from the present tank.\n\n22. A proper survey of the\u2014miles of\u2014rubble-faced\u00a7 banks, which hold up a succession of terraces to the south,\n\n* Album, C 419-478.\n\u2020 Andropogon Zeylanicus.\n\u2021 See Plan A.\n\u00a7 Album, C 470.\nwest, and north of the Rock, can be effected only after the whole area of the ancient nuwara is freed of undergrowth.\n\n23. In addition to the large area within which the whole of the low jungle has been cut and stacked into heaps for burning, a considerable number of trees was felled and cut up along the west face of the Rock and round the principal groups of boulders (\"Audience Hall,\" \"Cistern Rock,\" \"Preaching Rock,\" &c.) to better open out the view.\n\n24. It is now for the first time practicable to get a comprehensive view of the western side of Sigiri-gala from the commencement of the approach near \"Cistern Rock.\"\n\n(2) EXCAVATIONS.\n\n25. (a) On the Summit.\u2014Survey Plan (B) shows that the general fall of the ground\u2014doubtless following the slope of the living rock below\u2014is from west to east, and less abruptly from north to south. This natural declination was evidently turned to account in the adaptation of the ground for the terraces and buildings which once occupied it. The terraces along the high ground bordering the west edge and stretching inwards to about the axis of the hill, fall away very gradually from north to south, as do those from the central pokuna or pond, to the south and east verge of the Rock. The steepest bank runs longitudinally south from the north end of the Rock (marking the high ground off from the low level area excavated this year) to the pokuna, where the slope must be 40 ft. high, and upwards. The only high bank lying east and west adjoins the Rock's north-east edge,* but there are low banks south of the pond.\n\n26. The ground worked this year lies between (i.) the high back-bone slope down the centre, (ii.) the north-east verge of the Rock and (iii.) the pokuna, with (iv.) a portion on the south-west around the rock cistern. The whole area completed equals an acre or more.\u2020\n\n* Album, C 429, 430, and Drawing (C).\n\u2020 See Plan (B).\n27. Excavations were started from the head of the steps which still mark the point where the \"gallery\" reached the summit at the north-east edge of the Rock.\n\n28. Progress was necessarily slow. The intense\u2014almost unbearable\u2014heat on the exposed and shadeless Rock; only impure water from the pokuna to slake thirst; and an unusual depth (15 ft. in places)* to deal with of caked brick and stone d\u00e9bris held together by tree-roots, all rendered the daily task no light one.\n\n29. It soon became patent that we had to face ruins of at least two periods. Walls were found to run over walls, pavement above pavement, and stairs below stone ramps. I therefore deemed it advisable to sink the trenches down to the bare rock in most cases.\n\n30. As, too, the internal arrangement of rooms varied, every wall had to be followed along its inner as well as its outer face.\n\n31. Further, the certainty that buildings, passages, &c., covered the entire summit to the very edge of the cliff all round made it necessary to carry every basketful of earth, &c., to the eastern verge and throw it to spoil below.\n\n32. Broadly speaking, the buildings (so far as can at present be judged) seem to have contained spacious rooms separated by passages paved with quartz flags and united by quartz stairs\u2014quartz everywhere\u2014a striking feature of the Sigiriya ruins.\u2020\n\n33. One boldly-carved asanaya (9 ft. 10 in. by 4 ft. 6 in.), or throne, hewn out of the mah\u00e1-gala (the gneiss rock core), has been exposed. It fronts east, and lies at the foot of the high ground west of the area excavated.\u2021\n\n34. A little useful work was also done near the south-west edge. The cistern sunk here into the solid rock, measuring 13 ft. 2 in. by 9 ft. 10 in. and 8 ft. 6 in. in depth,\n\n* Drawing (C) and Album, C 475, 476.\n\u2020 See Plan (B).\n\u2021 Album, C 477, 478.\nwas cleared of some 7 ft. of brick and mud, and scrubbed clean for future use, the ground round about being dug up and levelled off to prevent the wash of the rains finding its way again into the cistern.*\n\n35. (b) Below the Rock.\u2014After the path from the tank to the ladders on the north side of the Rock had been widened and stripped of m\u00e1na grass and loose brick-bats, that made the approach additionally arduous from the difficulty of picking one\u2019s way with secure footing, only two parties were kept below, except during the time that the bambaru held the Rock against us.\n\n36. My first object was to settle the moot point as to the approach, or approaches, to the \u201cgallery\u201d from the lower terraces. A step or two peeping out here and there from the m\u00e1na-covered mound, strewn with bricks, which falls away westward from the present entrance to the \u201cgallery,\u201d pointed to stairs in this direction.\n\n37. Working from the Rock scarp a few yards south of the existing ascent into the \u201cgallery\u201d at the wide grooves which once held the \u201cgallery\u201d walls, the parties very soon struck two sets of stairs (quartz here again) branching off south-west and north-west and descending by a series of level landings and flights of steps. These stairs have been slowly followed\u2014each with its flanking brick wall to the right of the ascent\u2014down to the terrace immediately above the \u201cAudience Hall\u201d and \u201cCistern\u201d rocks.\n\n38. The southern descent manifestly runs along the slope of a south-westerly spur of the Great Rock, and finally curls inwards at the bottom, fully 10 ft. below present ground level.\u2020\n\n* Album, C 368. A small cave lies lower down, south. See Plan (B). Two ancient kalagedi, or water pots, recovered from the bottom of the cistern, have been sent to the Colombo Museum. These may be 1,400 years old.\n\n\u2020 Album, C 460, 461.\n39. That on the north\u2014six flights of steps at least, with intermediate landings\u2014mounts straight up due east from the ground just outside a stone gateway a little north-east of the \"Audience Hall,\" until, nearing the Rock, it converges to the south-east, and probably met the termination of the south approach at the \"gallery.\"*\n\n40. Some of these quartz staircases had as many as twenty to thirty steps, beautifully dressed, and several are still in excellent preservation.\n\n41. What buildings, &c., lay between the two approaches must be left for another season's excavation to settle.\n\n42. Between the \"Audience Hall\" and the \"Cistern\" rocks runs a narrow gorge or passage, and below their north-west and south-west angles respectively are two caves formed by the overhanging rock. Both these caves as well as the passage have been excavated.\n\n43. A flight of steps leads down into the gorge,\u2020 and there is an exit flight at the back (west) of the \"Cistern\" rock.\n\n44. The cave under this rock\u2014erroneously styled the \"Queen's Bath,\" from a supposed connection with the cistern above, equally misnamed the \"King's Bath\"\u2014has evidently been restored at some period. This was obvious from the low wall of wrought slabs with mouldings which surrounded the central rock-cut \u00e1sanaya having been built up irregularly in brick walls. These had to be demolished and the cave freed of a heavy accumulation of d\u00e9bris; the removal of which brought down part of the rock roof that had been loosened by damp and age, necessitating cautious blasting and a fresh clearance. During the last week of work the cave was finally emptied of fallen stone, brick, and earth; the moulded slab wall properly re-set; and a neat brick wall built on two sides to hide the fissures running back into the bowels of the rock.\u2021\n\n* Album, C 458, 459, 464. \u2020 Album, C 466 \u2021 Album, C 467.\n45. Opposite this cave, that under the \"Audience Hall\" rock was similarly dug out, and a semicircular brick wall, with middle entrance, exposed in front. This cave probably once served as a vih\u0101ra.*\n\n46. The connection between the area immediately east of the \"Audience Hall\" rock and the upper terraces has yet to be traced. Some trial trenches were dug near the gal\u0101sanaya,\u2020 which lies lower than the Audience Hall boulder, before work ceased for the year.\n\n47. \"Finds\" have been so far few, and somewhat disappointing: clay lamps, and water pots, a variety of potsherds, pieces of a white china bowl, a small stone figure of Buddha, a tiny crystal kara\u1e47\u1e0duva (relie casket), a flowered k\u016bra (hairpin) of copper, a small and hopelessly corroded coin, and half a bushel of iron and copper nails\u2014these complete the list.\n\n(3) OTHER WORK.\n\n48. (a) Whilst digging out the caves above mentioned we lighted on four worked slabs, which, upon measurement, fortunately proved to be the stones missing from the parapet wall of the rock cistern above. They must have fallen, or been thrown, over the rock centuries back.\n\n49. With infinite labour these heavy stones were rolled first along the gorge, then up a steep bank, and finally, by improvising an inclined plane of tree-trunks, dragged to the top of the rock, and once more accurately replaced. The cistern (16 ft. 2 in. by 8 ft. 1 in. and 5 ft. 7 in. deep), now properly restored, is not ornamental alone, but can be turned to practical service.\u2021\n\n50. (b) In the course of my personal exploration of the forest around S\u012bgiri-gala I climbed a strangely-shaped rock pitted with sockets for pillars, and with an eastward slope at a steep angle. This boulder is situated about 300 yards from the north-west end of the Great Rock. The\n\n* Album, C 468. A small marble Buddha was exhumed here.\n\u2020 Album, C 469. \u2021 Album, C 431, 432, 462, 463.\nsurface of the boulder when first seen was buried beneath a \"waterfall\" of *chatu-mul* (trailing roots of the *Ficus Tsiela*, Roxb.) and a thick crust of vegetable mould.\n\n51. A thorough clearance of the rock revealed three deeply incised seats (the largest 9 ft. by 7 ft. 4 in. by 3 ft. 9 in.) one above the other, down its centre, and on every side of them innumerable grooves and mortice holes.\n\n52. This new discovery I have provisionally named the \"Preaching Rock.\"* Its west and north-west faces overhang and form lofty caverns, two of which bear short inscriptions in cave character.\u2020\n\n53. (c) The slow abrasion of ages had filled the whole length of the \"Gallery\"\u2021 (355 ft. : average breadth, 7 ft.) with chips and fine dust worn off the rock face. The gray granite dust lay in some places a foot thick or more over the quartz flags which pave the gallery.\n\n54. I had the whole of this undesirable carpet removed\u2014a tedious process, for the dust had to be pushed by handfuls through the half-dozen \"weep-holes\" of the gallery floor. The appearance of the \"gallery\" with its six flights of steps has been very greatly improved by this clean sweep.\n\n(4) Measurements and Drawings.\n\n55. The measuring up and taking levels of the trenches, walls, steps, &c., excavated on the summit, as well as below the Rock, has been thoroughly done, and occupied much time. It was essentially necessary to do this work before leaving Sigiriya for the year, as the brickwork where exposed is so friable that the north-east monsoon will most assuredly bring down a great deal of it. Even the heavy but brief rain which fell in April washed away one wall and a flight of steps in a single night.\n\n56. Besides completing, in conjunction with my Head Overseer (A. P. Siriwardhana), a careful prismatic compass survey of the summit and the portion excavated this\n\n* Album, C 465. \u2020 These will be given in my Annual Report.\n\u2021 Album, C 448.\nyear,* Mr. D. A. L. Perera, First Draughtsman, Archaeological Survey, has made drawings to scale of\u2014\n\n(a) \"Gallery\" (plan).\n(b) \"Audience Hall Rock\" (plan and sections).\n(c) \"Cistern Rock\" (plan and sections).\n(d) Cave below (b) (plan and sections).\n(e) Cave below (c) (plan and sections).\n(f) \"Preaching Hall Rock\" (plan and sections).\n(g) Gal-\u0101sanaya on the summit of the Great Rock\u2020 (plan and sections).\n\n57. Mr. Perera was prepared with all requisite materials for copying in oils the fresco portraits\u2021 in the small caves or \"pockets\" situated nearly 50 ft. above the \"gallery\" floor and some 160 ft. from the ground. The brow of these caves projects, so that a plumb line from it falls only just within the \"gallery\" wall.\n\n58. In 1889, Mr. A. Murray, of the Public Works Department, by the aid of a trestle and rope ladder, gained access to the larger \"pocket\" and made facsimile tracings and drawings of the figures (portraits of queens). These were done in crayons, and are now hung above the staircase in the Colombo Museum.\n\n59. I have always held the view that, most admirable as are these drawings in themselves, they do not exhibit fully, first, the vividness, and secondly, the actual coarseness of the original colouring. A risky scramble into the \"pocket\" up a make-shift ladder of jungle-sticks lashed to jumpers,\u00a7 and hugging the concave face of the overhanging rock, confirmed this opinion. The portraits are painted in brilliant colours, and with that coarse \"dabbiness\" characteristic of scene-painting, which renders them so clear, yet soft, from a distance.\n\n* Plan (B). This, the first survey made of the summit of Sigiri-gala, does both officers much credit.\n\u2020 Mr. Perera also made a painting in oils of Sigiri-gala from the fields on the south-west. [Since shown at the \"Ceylon Art Exhibition\" of 1895.]\n\u2021 Album, C 182, 183, 457.\n\u00a7 Album, C 451, 452. I had this unsafe ladder removed before quitting Sigiriya, to prevent unnecessary risk to life, and chance of vandalism.\n60. A lengthy correspondence with the District Engineer, M\u00e1tal\u00e9, has so far failed to result in the carrying into practical execution of any plan for enabling my draughtsman to ascend and copy the frescoes. I trust, however, that the Public Works Department will solve the difficulty (not great) before 1896, and thus permit of my securing exact copies in oils of these unique specimens of ancient chromatic art, before swallows and bees together complete their destruction.*\n\n61. In conclusion, I should add that the huts and \"cooly lines\" have been placed by the Assistant Government Agent, M\u00e1tal\u00e9, in charge of the \u00c1rachchi and village headman, and will be available for occupation next year, with fresh leafing.\n\n62. I propose, with the approval of the Government, to resume work at Sigiriya on or about February 1, 1896, and to continue operations until the high wind commences about the end of April.\n\n4. His Excellency the Governor remarked that the Paper which had been read exhibited in a conspicuous degree the laborious, exhaustive, and able way in which Mr. Bell always did his work. An opportunity was now given to anybody present to supplement, or to illustrate, what had been already said by further descriptions and remarks. He saw among those present Mr. A. Murray, who was intimately acquainted with Sigiri Rock, more particularly as was shown by his copies of the frescoes now hung in the Museum hard by; and he was sure they would all be very glad if Mr. Murray would give them some further descriptive remarks on that interesting subject.\n\nMr. A. Murray said that he had had the active assistance in the copying of the frescoes of Mr. F. J. Pigott, of the Public Works Department, and also the co-operation of Mr. S. M. Burrows, then Assistant Agent, M\u00e1tal\u00e9. But in spite of the aid of those two gentlemen, it was most difficult to get the natives round Sigiriya to render any assistance, on account of the great superstition that existed. The headmen and priests had warned the villagers that any one assisting him in any way would be utterly annihilated. He had then to fall back upon two Canar\u00e9se, one of whom on getting to the overhanging portion of the rock, found that he was thrown over the precipice as it were. He declined to work any further, except on the condition that he should be allowed to fast for three days. Thinking this would make the man lighter (laughter) Mr. Murray allowed him to fast, and then he successfully resumed work. While he was copying the\n\n* I noticed that the execrable (and by no means modern) mania for scribbling names and initials, which has already so greatly disfigured the \"gallery\" walls, has even reached the fresco \"pockets,\" where names of Tamil workmen may be seen scrawled on the very paintings!\nfrescoes, Mr. Burrows and the gallant Major of the C. M. I. visited him at his work. Concerning Mr. Bell's remarks that the original colours had not been imitated, he might say that he (Mr. Murray) had taken up the colours and mixed them himself on the spot. After the copying had been accomplished Mr. Burrows thought it would be a good thing to leave something in the shape of a memento. They got a bottle, and in that they put some of the papers of the day and coins of local currency and deposited the bottle there. As they were leaving the rock a Buddhist and a Sivite priest came up and asked to be allowed to pray for the preservation of the bottle. (Laughter.) Permission was given, and while the natives prayed he and Mr. Burrows, wondering what they could do in the way of dedication and sentiment, sang \"God Save the Queen.\" Before concluding, Mr. Murray said he must mention that he was simply astonished at the amount of solid good work done by Mr. Bell.\n\nHis Excellency said he had himself been up the Sigiriya rock, to a point called the end of the \"gallery,\" from which the frescoes copied by Mr. Murray were visible, and he could himself testify to the extreme difficulty and risk one ran in achieving even that portion (the \"gallery\") of the ascent of the Rock. Even looking up at the frescoes almost made one shudder from fear of falling over the precipice close behind, and Mr. Murray's position there, lying on his back, represented to His Excellency's mind what could only be described by the word \"heroic.\"\n\nIn reply to Mr. J. Ferguson, who inquired if that gentleman was the first European who had ascended the rock this century, Mr. Murray said that Mr. L. Creasy and General Lennox had reached the top eighteen months before. He may have been the first to get to the pocket containing the frescoes.\n\nMr. J. Harward remarked that Colonel Meaden had told him that day that he visited Sigiriya in 1856, and though the weather prevented his ascent, English people had undoubtedly done so before that.*\n\nMr. C. M. Fernando said that all of them were indebted to Messrs. Bell and Murray for the interesting Papers and the frescoes. He submitted that those frescoes were of great interest to the students of the history of Ceylon. It was sometimes said that the Sinhalese knew nothing about the fine arts. According to the early history of Ceylon, it was found that there were paintings representing men and women in real life during the fifth century of the Christian era, as seen at Sigiriya. He also spoke of the temple of Ajanta in the Deccan, where pictures similar to those in Sigiriya were found. According to Dr. Fergusson, the Ajanta temple was rich in frescoes representing the incidents of the history of Buddhism in Ceylon. This certainly he thought confirmed the statements of the 14th chapter of the Mahavamsa. The frescoes in Ajanta depict, amongst others, the arrival of Mahindo, the elk hunting of Devanampiya Tissa, and the incidents of that monarch's reign in Ceylon. He quoted Sir Emerson Tennent, in support of his contention regarding the artistic faculties of the primitive Sinhalese.\n\nMr. F. C. Roles, after commenting on Mr. Murray's historical references to the rock fortifications, described the difficulties and discomforts of the journey. He had heard the name of Colonel Churchill\n\n* [The first Europeans to reach the summit were Messrs. A. Y. Adams and J. Bailey, who made the ascent in 1853.\u2014B.]\nmentioned as one of the Europeans who had scaled Sigiriya before the rickety bamboo ladders had been replaced by iron ones and an iron rail.\n\n5. Mr. R. W. Ievers said he had some remarks to offer in a spirit of contrition, as he had visited Sigiriya several times, but more with a view to bear-shooting than the acquisition of archaeological lore. He had another matter of self-abasement and apology to offer. Mr. Bell had justly complained of the vandalism of visitors who had inscribed their obscure names on the beautiful chunam of the gallery. He was, alas! a vandal. He had placed his obscure name there. His only apology was that it was through a desire to inscribe it close to that of one of His Excellency's illustrious predecessors, who had not alone been Governor of Ceylon, but had ruled the Presidency of Madras. Mr. Ievers confessed embarrassment in fulfilling the wish of the Committee that he should propose a vote of thanks to Mr. Bell for the valuable Paper they had just heard read. It was due to the Governor that they had an opportunity of hearing the Paper, which had been furnished by Mr. Bell as an official Report. While acknowledging His Excellency's benevolence to the Society, the Meeting might none the less thank Mr. Bell for the care and pains he had taken in one of the chief branches in which the Royal Asiatic Society was interested, namely, Archaeology. He had therefore no further hesitation in moving that a vote of thanks be accorded to Mr. Bell.\n\nMr. Staniforth Green seconded the motion.\n\nHis Excellency, in putting the motion to the Meeting, spoke again of the thoroughness with which Mr. Bell had done the work entrusted to him.\n\nThe motion was carried with acclamation.\n\n6. Mr. J. Ferguson said the pleasant duty had just been committed to him of moving a cordial vote of thanks to His Excellency the Governor for presiding over the Meeting. An additional reason was afforded in the fact mentioned by Mr. Ievers that the Society was indebted to the Governor for Mr. Bell's Paper. But he believed the oldest Member would bear him out in saying that no previous Governor had more readily and consistently given his countenance and support to their Society than had Sir Arthur Havelock. (Applause.) This might be a farewell appearance of His Excellency at a Meeting of the Society, though he hoped not; but if it was, an additional interest was lent from the fact that the Paper read had to do with that Archaeological Survey which His Excellency had made it his special object to promote. It was also of interest to them, that in Southern India the Governor would be in a land closely connected with the past history of Ceylon, and when matters arose of local interest His Excellency would probably not forget the Ceylon Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society. He moved a very cordial vote of thanks. (Applause.)\n\nMr. F. M. Mackwood seconded the motion, which was carried with applause.\n\n7. His Excellency, in acknowledging the vote, said: I beg to thank Mr. Ferguson for the very kind way in which he has proposed this vote of thanks, and the Meeting for the very cordial way in which you have received it. The fact that my leaving Ceylon will not take me far from you is some little consolation to me in the great feeling of regret with which I anticipate my departure from amongst you.

(as in the case of all private accounts), had been added to the actual cost of printing done for the Society at the Government Press, instead of the work being executed at cost price as hitherto.\n\nThe Honorary Secretaries explained that the charge had been made without any previous official communication about the matter from the Government Printer. A letter from the Honorary Treasurer to the Honorary Secretary was read to the Meeting, in which the former stated that he had an interview with the Acting Government Printer on the subject, who gave as his reason for not acquainting the Society with the fact of the new charge, that the order was simply a Departmental one.\n\nAfter some discussion it was decided that the Secretaries do look up the correspondence and endeavour to ascertain how the Society came originally to have its publications printed at the Government Press, and under what conditions; and that in the event of a satis-\nfactory settlement not being arrived at with the Government Printer (viz., to continue the old practice of charging only for actual cost of printing and paper), that the matter be laid before the Government, with a request for a continuance of the privilege enjoyed by the Society for so many years, and which, if withdrawn, would seriously affect the Society.\n\n5. The Honorary Treasurer proposed that the amounts owing by gentlemen whose names have been struck off the roll of Membership for arrears of subscriptions be recovered from them, if necessary by course of law. The Honorary Treasurer stated that these outstandings amounted to nearly Rs. 600, and all of the gentlemen in arrears had received the publications of the Society for several years and enjoyed all the privileges of Membership.\n\nResolved,\u2014That the matter do stand over for the next Meeting, and that a draft rule be submitted to the Council at its next Meeting, whereby no person shall be enrolled a Member, or receive any publication of the Society, until his entrance fee be paid.\nCOUNCIL MEETING.\n\nColombo Museum, October 15, 1895.\n\nPresent:\nThe Right Rev. the Lord Bishop of Colombo, President, in the Chair.\nMr. F. M. Mackwood. | Dr. W. G. Vandort.\nMr. F. C. Roles, Honorary Treasurer.\nMr. J. Harward and Mr. G. A. Joseph, Honorary Secretaries.\n\nBusiness.\n\n1. Read and confirmed Minutes of last Meeting held on Tuesday, September 24, 1895.\n\n2. Mr. Harward informed the Council that the Government Printer had been communicated with regarding the question of the extra charge of 30 per cent. added to the actual cost of printing done for the Society. The Society had hitherto been charged for actual cost of printing and paper only.\n\nMr. Harward added that the correspondence bearing on the circumstances and conditions under which the Society came originally to have its publications printed at the Government Press was being looked up with a view to Government being addressed on the subject.\n\n3. Laid on the table the following Circulars:\n\n(a) No. 233 of September 29, 1895, containing a Paper on \"Ridi Vih\u00e1ra,\" being a continuation of the series of Papers on \"Ancient Cities and Temples in the Kurun\u00e9gala District,\" by Mr. F. Modder, referred to Mr. H. C. P. Bell for his opinion.\n\n(b) No. 234 of September 29, 1895, containing a Paper on \"Panduas Nuwara,\" being a continuation of the series of Papers on \"Ancient Cities and Temples in the Kurun\u00e9gala District,\" by Mr. F. Modder, referred to Mr. H. C. P. Bell for his opinion.\n\nResolved,\u2014That the Council approve of Mr. Bell's recommendation that the Papers be accepted and read at any Meeting or Meetings of the Society to be hereafter fixed, and that they be printed in the Society's Journal.\n\n4. Laid on the table a Paper entitled \"The Portuguese Expeditions under Baretro and De Castro to the Court of Kandy (1549-50 A.D.),\" by Mr. C. M. Fernando, referred to Mr. D. W. Ferguson for his opinion.\n\nResolved, in view of Mr. Ferguson's remarks, that it be laid aside for the present and the writer be informed.\n\n5. Laid on the table a letter from Mr. W. P. R\u0101nasinha regarding Mr. T. B. Pohath's Paper entitled \"How the last King of Kandy was captured by the British.\"\nResolved,\u2014That Mr. Pohath be informed that the Council thank him for re-correcting his Paper as desired, but wish the Paper to be prefaced with an Introductory Note giving particulars regarding the original, its date of publication, the name of the eye-witness alluded to, and full details as to the sources of his information.\n\n6. Laid on the table Mr. W. A. de Silva\u2019s Paper entitled \u201cA Note on an Ancient method employed in the instruction of Elementary Sinhalese,\u201d referred to Messrs. E. R. Gunaratna, Mudaliy\u00e1r, and Simon de Silva, Mudaliy\u00e1r, for their opinions, together with a copy of the article in the Ceylon Friend referred to by these gentlemen to whom the Paper was referred for report.\n\nResolved,\u2014That the Council having considered the matter, is of opinion that Mr. de Silva should be informed the Paper contains nothing of importance besides what appears in the Ceylon Friend and in the Appendix to the Sidath Sangarava, and that, as the system of teaching alluded to is still in use, the Paper be returned to Mr. de Silva with an expression of thanks for its having been offered to the Society.\n\n7. Discussed the Honorary Treasurer\u2019s proposal, viz., that the amounts owed by the gentlemen whose names have been struck off the roll of Membership for being in default for subscriptions be recovered from them, if necessary, by legal proceedings. The Honorary Treasurer explained that since the last Meeting he had ascertained that legal proceedings would be costly and entail much trouble\u2014the signature of all the Members of the Society would have to be taken to sue these defaulters.\n\nThe Council agreed that it was not desirable under the circumstances to take further action in the matter.\n\n8. Considered the question of holding a conversazione to celebrate the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Society\u2019s foundation.\n\nThe President stated that he had been notified when in Europe of the wish of the Council that he should deliver an Address on the past history of the Institution at a conversazione, and in reply to the Secretary he had stated that he would accede to that wish\u2014a decision which he understood had already been communicated to the Council.\n\nAn extract from Minutes of Meeting held on January 21, 1895, regarding the holding of a conversazione, was read.\n\nResolved,\u2014That a conversazione be held to celebrate the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Society\u2019s foundation, and that the Members present, together with the Hon. P. Coom\u00e1rasw\u00e1my, Messrs. J. Ferguson, C. M. Fernando, E. S. W. Sen\u00e1thi R\u00e1j\u00e1, and Tudor R\u00e1japaksa, Mud\u00e1liyar, do constitute a Committee, with power to add to their number, to make necessary arrangements; that Mr. Haly, the Director of the Museum, be requested to aid by giving his kind co-operation and assistance; that he be asked to attend the Meetings of the Committee, of which notice would be given to him; and that a Meeting be held on Tuesday, the 22nd instant, at 5.30 p.m.\n\n9. The Honorary Secretaries submitted a draft rule (as desired by the Council) to the effect that no person shall be enrolled a Member or receive any publications of the Society until his entrance fee has been paid.\n\nMr. Joseph explained that there was no necessity for such a rule, as Members by Rule No. 29, had to pay their entrance fee and subscription on admission, and all subscriptions are due in advance.\nIt was decided that there was no occasion for passing such a rule, but that it be laid down that no person be considered a Member until he has been reported by the Treasurer to have qualified as such by payment of all dues.\n\n10. Laid on the table a Paper entitled \"Legislation in Ceylon in the early portion of the Century,\" by Mr. H. White.\n\nResolved,\u2014That the Paper be referred to Mr. F. M. Mackwood and Dr. W. G. Vandort for their opinions, and that it be left an open question as to whether the Paper should be read at the conversazione or not if passed by these gentlemen.\n\nCOUNCIL MEETING.\n\nColombo Museum, November 12, 1895.\n\nPresent:\n\nMr. Staniforth Green in the Chair.\n\nMr. P.

Read and confirmed Minutes of Council held on October 15, 1895.\n\n2. Laid on the table Minutes of the Sub-Committee appointed to make arrangements for the holding of a conversazione to celebrate the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Society's foundation.\n\nRead the following resolution of the Sub-Committee:\n\n\"The Sub-Committee having carefully gone into matters in detail, and having heard the Treasurer's report on the finances of the Society, feel that they are unable to advise the holding of a conversazione this year, and recommend its postponement until the early part of 1896.\"\n\nA discussion ensued as to the feasibility of holding a conversazione during the present year.\n\n(a) Mr. R\u00e1man\u00e1than offered to bear the entire cost of lighting of the Museum.\n\n(b) Mr. Fre\u00fcdenberg undertook to circulate a subscription list amongst Members of Council and such other Members of the Society as may be willing to contribute towards the cost of the conversazione.\n\nResolved,\u2014That the foregoing proposals be laid before His Lordship the Bishop, as President, and, if approved, that the subscription\nlist be circulated and the question again submitted to the Council at an early date.\n\n3. Resolved,\u2014That the following Candidates for admission as Resident Members be elected, viz.:\n\n(a) Le\u00f3n d'Espagnac: nominated by (1) G. A. Joseph; (2) F. H. Modder.\n\n(b) Dr. P. M. Muttukum\u00e1ra: nominated by (1) Dr. Brito; (2) S. G. Lee.\n\n4. Laid on the table a Paper entitled \"Legislation in Ceylon in the early portion of the Century,\" by Mr. H. White, c.c.s., referred to Mr. F. M. Mackwood and Dr. Vandort for their opinion.\n\nResolved,\u2014That the Paper be accepted and read at a Meeting of the Society.\n\n5. Laid on the table a Paper entitled \"On a curious Nematoid Parasite from the stomach of a Ceylon Insect (Mantis religiosa),\" by Mr. O. Collet, together with specimen mounted by Mr. A. Haly, Director of the Colombo Museum.\n\nResolved,\u2014That the Paper be accepted, and the writer be thanked for it.\n\n6. Laid on the table the Catalogue of the Library.\n\nResolved,\u2014That the Catalogue be sold at Re.1 per copy to Members and Rs. 2 to Non-Members.\n\n7. Laid on the table the following letter from the Government regarding the additional 30 per cent. charged for printing the Society's publications:\n\nColonial Secretary's Office,\nColombo, November 8, 1895.\n\nSir,\u2014I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 270 of October 20, 1895, and to acquaint you that the Government Printer has been instructed to withdraw the additional charge of 30 per cent. for the printing done for the Royal Asiatic Society during the current year.\n\nIt has further been decided that after this year the Society should pay this percentage in order to save the Printing Establishment from loss.\n\nI am, &c.,\n\nThe Honorary Secretary,\nRoyal Asiatic Society,\nCeylon Branch.\n\nH. L. Crawford,\nfor Colonial Secretary.\n\nResolved,\u2014That the Secretaries be empowered to continue correspondence with Government with a view to obtaining a re-consideration of the decision conveyed in paragraph 2 of the Colonial Secretary's letter.\n\n8. Resolved,\u2014That the consideration of holding a General Meeting of the Society do stand over until the Council meet again and decide the question as to a conversazione.\n\n9. Resolved,\u2014That the following Papers be read at the next Meeting:\n\n(1) \"Legislation in Ceylon in the early portion of the Century.\"\n(2) \"On a curious Nematoid Parasite from the stomach of a Ceylon Insect (Mantis religiosa).\"\nCOUNCIL MEETING.\n\nColombo Museum, November 28, 1895.\n\nPresent:\n\nThe Right Rev. the Lord Bishop of Colombo, in the Chair.\nMr. Staniforth Green. | Mr. P. Fre\u00fcdenberg.\nHon. P. Coom\u00e1rasw\u00e1my.\nMr. J. Harward and Mr. G. A. Joseph, Honorary Secretaries.\n\nBusiness.\n\n1. Read and confirmed Minutes of Meeting of Council held on November 12, 1895.\n\n2. Mr. Harward informed the Council that further correspondence had been carried on with Government in regard to the extra charge of 30 per cent. added to the cost of printing the Society's Publications.\n\n3. Laid on the table the printed Catalogue of the Library.\n\nResolved,\u2014That a vote of thanks be accorded to Mr. Joseph for compiling it.\n\n4. Considered the matter of making arrangements for holding the Conversazione to celebrate the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Society's foundation.\n\nResolved,\u2014That the Conversazione be held on Wednesday, December 11, and that a Sub-Committee consisting of Messrs. C. M. Fernando, J. Harward, G. A. Joseph, F. M. Mackwood, F. H. Price, and P. R\u00e1man\u00e1than be appointed to make the necessary arrangements.\n\nResolved,\u2014That 50 guests be invited in the name of the Council by the Sub-Committee.\n\nResolved,\u2014That every Member who has paid his subscription get one ticket of admission for himself and two friends.\nTHE JUBILEE COMMEMORATION.*\n\nHeld at the Colombo Museum on December 11, 1895.\n\nThe function at the Colombo Museum last night was attended by all the principal residents of the city, as well as by a number of Members and their friends from outstations, and passed off most successfully.\n\nThe building and grounds had been elaborately and tastefully illuminated, the difficulties of such an undertaking, as regards the interior of the Museum, having been surmounted by Mr. P. Ramanathan, C.M.G., who at his own expense lighted that section. The drive approaches were lined with Japanese lanterns, and the balconies were crowded with rows of cocoanut oil lamps, which made the scene from the road a very effective one, the edifice being set in frames of light. The portico and Sir William Gregory's statue in front were further ornamented with lines of flags and lamps, and at the base of the statue were clusters of evergreens and incandescent globes. The doorways of the entrance hall were draped with flags used as curtains, and at the foot of the main staircase, overhead, was a festoon of stag moss with large letters of the same representing the initials of the title of the Society. The landing on the stairs was embowered in greenery and glow lamps, and at other suitable spots there were groups of plants.\n\nAll the rooms of the Museum were open for the occasion; and there were other loan exhibits, besides a display of coloured plates, photograph albums, and other valuable volumes on the Library room table. Handsome ola books were also on view, and the official ola copier was in attendance, with his stylus, to illustrate the process on fresh ola leaves.\n\nThe other special exhibits comprised the following:\u2014Messrs. Boustead Brothers staged a number of electrical exhibits in the entrance hall, with the latest designs in lamps, and a little ventilating fan which was kept working. Opposite this was a Gardner gun worked by an artilleryman and lent by the Officer Commanding the Royal Artillery. Mr. A. W. Andree, Photographer, exhibited a transparency consisting of very clear views of the Museum and the principal features to be found in its rooms. Upstairs, at the west end, Mr. Staniforth Green presided over his table of microscopes, and had\u2014mounted by himself\u2014such things of special interest as a specimen of the coffee leaf disease, a section of a brown pearl, and the smallest Ceylon wasp\u2014one-sixtieth of an inch long\u2014besides other things. Close by was a collection of apparatus, including a galvanic battery, from the Royal College, Mr. Walker being in charge. At the east end Dr. H. M. Fernando exhibited the electric light in vacuum coloured tubes, which were constantly charged. He also had a series of microscopic studies, including a live fibaria from the blood of the chameleon, and also a fibaria, not living, taken from elephantiasis in a human body. Mr. W. A. de Silva had a display\n\n* Extracted from the Times of Ceylon and Ceylon Observer of December 12, 1895.\nof chemicals; and from the Technical School there was a collection of a variety of articles most creditably turned out by students at the Institution, from a model steam engine down to wooden blocks. These things were sent by Mr. E. Human, the Superintendent.\n\nNon-intoxicating and light refreshments of various kinds were supplied ad libitum from buffets both above and on the ground floor. The Volunteer band was stationed in front of the Museum, and under the baton of Bandmaster L\u00fcschwitz played a well-selected programme.\n\nThe scientific displays were procured by Mr. J. Harward, and the decorations and illuminations were under the supervision of Mr. G. A. Joseph, Honorary Secretaries of the Society, the latter being aided by the Museum staff. Mr. Philip Freudenberg, among other Members of the Council, had also rendered special service in the necessary preliminaries, while the Sub-Committee consisted of the following:\u2014Messrs. P. Ramanathan, F. M. Mackwood, F. H. Price, C. M. Fernando, J. Harward, and G. A. Joseph.\n\nA deputation of officials, including Mr. A. Haly, the Director of the Museum, met His Excellency Sir E. Noel Walker, who was accompanied by Captains Lowndes and Justice, at the entrance punctually at 9 o'clock, while His Lordship the Bishop of Colombo (President of the Society) received the Lieutenant-Governor in the Reading Room of the Institution, where Sir Edward at once occupied the Chair.\n\nOn taking the Chair, His Excellency the Lieutenant-Governor said:\u2014Ladies and gentlemen,\u2014I call on his Lordship, the Bishop of Colombo, to address the Meeting. Happily the Bishop requires no introduction, and certainly his Address calls for no words of preface from me.\n\nThe Bishop of Colombo, who was received with loud applause, said:\u2014Your Excellency, ladies, and gentlemen,\u2014\n\nA Sketch of the Early History of the Ceylon Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society.\n\nIn an attempt to present to the Members of this Society a sketch of its earlier history, I am encouraged by the conviction that I cannot but lead them, though I indulge in no exaggeration, to think more highly than before of the Institution to which it is their privilege to belong. For few, I fancy, especially among the younger Members, are quite aware how considerable a part this Society has played in the development of the Colony. Though it has passed through many periods of alternating prosperity and decline\u2014vicissitude has been, indeed, the law of its existence\u2014yet it has been served by a succession\u2014though a broken succession\u2014of most able men, and the continuity of its life has never been so completely severed as to forbid us at the\npresent day to claim our title to the credit of those services which our Society has rendered in the past.\n\nIf it had been at one of the Society's least flourishing moments that I found myself called upon to pass its history in review, I should have argued that history forbade us to despair of it, and assured us that it was worth preserving and handing on. But standing, as it is my good fortune now to stand, at a point which in one respect\u2014in regard of numbers and of popularity\u2014is, perhaps, the highest that the Society has yet reached, the moral I am bound to draw is rather this: that our only sound title to the respect of those who come after us must be founded, not on our having amused one another for the moment, but on solid work done and results accumulated, and therefore on our securing not only the patronage of numbers, but the disinterested services of men of real learning and research.\n\nFor the benefit of those\u2014and they are the large majority of us\u2014to whom the earlier proceedings of the Society are matters not of recollection, but of ancient history, I propose briefly to describe the circumstances of its foundation, and to indicate\u2014so far as I have learnt it\u2014what its original character was. We shall then trace the chief vicissitudes of its fortune, and commemorate the names of those benefactors\u2014for so they deserve to be called\u2014by whom, after each period of depression, it was revived. We shall take note in passing of some of those Papers which appear\u2014without disparagement to others\u2014to have been the most widely or permanently valuable among our proceedings; and we shall observe how, in days before the different Scientific Departments of the Public Service had been fully developed, this Society anticipated their work, and fostered their beginnings or drew attention to their necessity. In this last connection we shall especially emphasize with a just pride the Society's part in the formation of the Colony's Natural History collections, and its title to a large share in the credit and in the privileges of the magnificent Museum in which we are now assembled.\nFifty Years ago.\n\nOur Society was founded, as everyone knows, about fifty years ago\u2014on February 7, 1845. It is rarely indeed that we can explore the foundations of anything without finding among them or beneath them the traces of some earlier effort: even under the oldest stones of the Homeric Troy lie the golden cups of those brave men who lived before Agamemnon. And so we find the founders of our Society acknowledging the difficulty of their undertaking by repeated allusions to the \"fate of former Literary Societies in the Island\" (I. 166, 210). Half had then passed of the period that has as yet elapsed of English occupation. During the second half of that century our Society has endured; and it will enter on a second century with happier auguries, drawn, not from the failure of others, but from its own vitality.\n\nFirst Year.\n\nFebruary 7, 1845, is justly reckoned as the date of our foundation, but during the year 1814 preparations had been made for it. Members had come together; relations had been opened with the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal; and subscriptions, it would appear, had been collected. It had been already ascertained what persons were in earnest in the matter, as the first selection of officers abundantly proved.\n\nThe Governor of the Colony accepted the title of Patron, and the Chief Justice, the Bishop, and the Colonial Secretary were made Vice-Patrons, but none of these appear at first to have played any active part.\n\nOne of the Judges, however, Mr. Justice Stark, did signal service, and was an enthusiastic President. I am not sure that the proceedings prove him to have been specially learned in any one branch of the Society's work, but he delivered Addresses of much literary eloquence and dignity, contributed a few Papers which at least suggested lines of study, and by his regularity and evident devotion to the interests of the Society must have contributed very considerably to its early success.\nNext to him, as Vice-President, came the Rev. J. G. MacVicar, a gentleman who was genuinely one of our founders and earliest benefactors; he read several able Papers, attended the Committee Meetings with unfailing regularity, and was the largest donor among those whose gifts of books formed the nucleus of our Library.\n\nThe first Treasurer was a man whose name has a permanent place among the historians of Ceylon, Mr. Wm. Knighton.\n\nBut it is to our first Secretary, above all, that we owe lasting gratitude, both for his energy at the beginning and for his services continued during very many years, and until a time within the remembrance, I suppose, of most of us: one whose name is still among those of our Honorary Members. Others have held higher office in the Ceylon Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society; others have read more important Papers (though his contributions have been by no means insignificant); but none have served the Society more constantly or more efficiently than Mr. John Capper.\n\nBut the moment of our Society's foundation was a happy one, not only from the presence of men so well qualified to fill its offices, but even more from the presence in the Island, at that one time, of a remarkable group of men, whose names hold permanent places in literature. It was an auspicious moment\u2014in the language of astrology\u2014from the conjunction of many stars of the first magnitude. The names of Tennent, Gogerly, Spence Hardy, and Lee will be accepted in justification of what I say. With these, the Rev. B. Bailey and several other men of scholarship and culture combined to place the young Society at once on a distinguished level.\n\nThe first Paper was one on Buddhism by the Rev. D. Gogerly, and it was indeed well worthy to lead the way. It is probable that no subsequent Paper has altogether equalled it for the amount of reading which it embodies in a subject and in a language then almost new to European students. It is hardly too much to say that fifty\nyears, during which the study of the P\u00e1li books has become general, have not placed us in a position to produce a sketch of the Southern Buddhism, which should be in any considerable degree better than that first one. The writer gives an outline of the *Dhamma Sangani*, one of the more difficult P\u00e1li treatises, summarizes the contents of the *Vinaya Pitaka*, dwelling in detail on certain early portions, and in particular abridging the life of Gautama as it is given in the *Mah\u0101 Wagga*, as far as the delivery of the sermon of the Wheel of the Law; sketches the rest of the Buddha\u2019s life, and discusses the theory of Nirw\u00e1na, as consisting in the cessation of existence. It is impossible for us not to feel gratified, as Members of this Society, that we did not leave it to others to take the first step in a study for which we, as residents in Ceylon, are especially responsible.\n\nThis was followed by a Paper by Mr. Knighton on the translated literature of Ceylon, which very properly invited attention to the *Mah\u00e1v\u00e1nya* and *R\u00e1j\u00e1waliya* and a few other books, but contributed nothing original except a little graceful criticism.\n\nMr. MacVicar comes next with a Paper on the voice and the use of the Roman alphabet to express Sinhalese letters, advocating Sir W. Jones\u2019 system of diacritical marks. It contains the result of a good deal of reading and some acute remarks. The writer notes, among other things, what is a curious difference\u2014if it is the case\u2014between the roar of the lion and the mew of the cat. Both of them produce their effect by uttering in succession all the three principal natural vowel sounds\u2014as the writer considers them\u2014but while the king of beasts begins with the mouth open and ends with the lips nearly closed on the thinnest vowel, his humbler brother begins with the \u201ci\u201d sound and proceeds to the broader and deeper.\n\nMr. Capper struck another vein and opened with some notes on the \u201cKuruminiya,\u201d or cocoanut beetle, the long series of contributions to practical science, which has included many useful Papers, up to Mr. Elliott\u2019s on the\nCultivation of Paddy, or the lamented Mr. A. M. Ferguson's on Plumbago.\n\nThe President, Justice Stark, read a Paper on the State of Crime, and Mr. Casie Chitty, long a valuable Member, gave an account of some coins found at Kalpitiya.\n\nThe remaining Paper which has come down to us from that year is a second by Mr. Capper on Statistics, in which is indicated yet another branch of the Society's work. He urges, in days (let it be remembered) when there was no Registrar-General's Department, and more than twenty years before its Statistical Branch was formed, \"the desirability of collecting, by the agency of Members of the Society, Vital Statistics, Statistics of Crime, of Education, of Traffic, and of the then rising Coffee industry,\" and he offers some suggestions as to the method of their collection.\n\nOne other Paper, on the Temple of Dambulla, was read, but apparently not printed.\n\nBut these papers did not form the whole of the Society's work.\n\nThe beginnings were made of a Library, and two Committees were appointed, one\u2014of which not much apparently came\u2014for the comparison of the Buddhism of Ceylon with that of Nepal; and the other for the establishment of meteorological stations throughout Ceylon, and the collection of reports from them, a work which the Society prosecuted under great difficulties, but with praiseworthy persistence, till its efforts were at once superseded and rewarded by the establishment of the observatories connected with the Surveyor-General's Department.\n\nAnother piece of practical business carried through was the association of the Society with the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain, as its Ceylon Branch, with important privileges granted to us by the parent Society.\n\nI have not feared that I should weary you by this summary of our first year's work, because it is obviously interesting to observe, both how high the quality of individual Papers\nwas, and how promptly from the first the Society addressed itself to all the divisions of the object which it had proposed to itself by its title as a Society founded \"to institute and promote inquiries into the History, Religions, Literature, Arts, and Natural Philosophy of Ceylon, together with the social condition of its present and former inhabitants.\" The Art of Ceylon is the only topic among these which was not dealt with in that first year.\n\nSecond Year.\n\nThe records of the second year show that distinct progress was made upon all these lines. Sir Emerson Tennent became President, Mr. Justice Stark Vice-President, but it was by the latter that the Annual Address was delivered.\n\nIt was natural that Sir E. Tennent should be made President, it was perhaps equally natural that\u2014engaged as he may already have been in collecting materials for his important book, though this was not published till 1859\u2014he should not take any very practical part in its proceedings. I do not find record of any Paper contributed by him, or even of his delivering any Presidential address.\n\nThe Address which was delivered in his place by Mr. Justice Stark, among much that was exactly what it should be, contains some expressions which show plainly enough that it had not yet occurred to the promoters of our Society that it was other than a European one. The natives of this country, Sinhalese and Tamils, were treated as the objects of inquiry, not as being themselves among the inquirers. There were indeed on the list a few gentlemen of native race, notably Mr. Casie Chitty, but they were officers of Government, about whom it might be taken for granted that they would look at most matters from the European point of view.\n\nMembers of the Society will no doubt with satisfaction contrast in this respect the present composition of the Society with its earlier limited character. So many of us are now of Sinhalese or Tamil race that it can be no longer mistaken\nfor a Society exclusively European. This progress has gone still further, and we welcome among us as fellow students not a few distinguished persons who cannot be counted as Christians. The language of some of Mr. Gogerly's contributions and of other early Papers\u2014indeed of some much later ones\u2014in their discussion of points of Buddhist or of Hind\u00fa religion was such as could not now be used among us. I do not regret this. Instead of being a Society of European Christian visitors, interested, as visitors, in an Island to which they did not belong, we are now a Society of studious people separated by many distinctions of race and association, but all keenly interested in whatever belongs to Ceylon, whether bound to it as the scene of our duty or by the still stronger ties of fatherland.\n\nYet even in those days there were indications\u2014it is amusing to observe\u2014of that friendly jealousy which still gives animation to our proceedings whenever the patriotism of Sinhalese and of Tamil scholars finds occasion for expression. Mr. Casie Chitty would not let the Sinhalese and P\u00e1li scholars have it all their own way, but read a learned Paper on the Tiruv\u00e1tav\u00far Pur\u00e1na, in which La\u1e45k\u00e1 pays tribute to Southern India and Buddhists are defeated by Saivites.\n\nA Characteristic Paper.\n\nMr. Gogerly produced in 1847 several Papers on the S\u00fatras, among which was his very memorable translation of the Brahmaj\u00e1la S\u00fatra.\n\nBut the characteristic Paper of the year must have been, I think, Mr. Spence Hardy's, on the Sinhalese Language and Literature, a fruit of that extensive and accurate study of which the later results are famous in his published books. It is remarkable as a proof of the extent of his study, that he refers to his own list of 400 Sinhalese works. His statements were, however, in several points open to correction, and the disparaging tone in which he spoke of the Sinhalese literature as being almost exclusively translations may have done something to arouse the late distinguished Hon. James\nde Alwis to produce his important Papers in vindication of the literature of his nation.\n\nDr. Gygax, who must have been one of the most earnest promoters of the Society on its scientific side, read a Paper on the Colouring Matter of the Cocoanut Husk; and Dr. Palm, in a first Paper on the Dutch System of Education in Ceylon, led the way in that useful work of utilizing the Colony\u2019s wealth in Dutch records and histories, in which he has been so well followed by several in our own day, notably by Mr. F. H. de Vos and Mr. D. W. Ferguson.\n\nThe Library.\n\nMeanwhile the Library was augmented by new gifts: in the direction of meteorology the Committee brought in its report, and the purchase of instruments, to be lent by the Society to various observers, was authorized; while in the commencement of a cabinet of minerals and one of coins was laid the true foundation of this great Museum. This work was carried on, and the interest of the Members in it was kept up, not by occasional public Meetings only, but by monthly Meetings of a less formal character\u2014Meetings for conversation, held, as I gather, in the houses of Members. The extension of the Society has now perhaps rendered such Meetings impracticable; but it is easy to imagine that they must have given the Society a more prominent place among the interests of each Member, than we can now expect it to assume except with a few.\n\nIn the following year a Statistical Committee was formed; the collection of minerals was enlarged, chiefly I suppose, by the energy of Dr. Gygax, who read a good Paper on the Mineralogy of Ceylon; and in the direction of meteorology suggestions were thrown out for the erection of an Observatory in Colombo.\n\nMeanwhile literary contributions came in, chiefly from the Members whom I have already mentioned\u2014and the example was set by Mr. A. O. Brodie, then at Puttalum, of Civil Servants at outstations giving the Society the benefit of\nobservations which they have had occasion to make in the course of their public duty, an example which has been excellently followed by some whose names are still upon our list.\n\n**Maintaining the Record.**\n\nSuch is the brilliant record of the Society's beginnings. The level was maintained, or there was no conspicuous falling-off for several years more.\n\nIn 1853, for instance, Mr. Gogerly was continuing his translations and summaries of the P\u0101li texts; Mr. Brodie, his contributions from Puttalam; while Mr. Layard, who was now the energetic Secretary, and Mr. Kelaart were furnishing valuable notes on the Birds of the Island.\n\nThe position occupied by the Society in this period may be gathered from the fact that Government looked to it to collect objects of interest for the great Exhibition of 1851, and afterwards for the Paris Exhibition of 1855. The collection made for 1851 does not seem to have satisfied the officers of the Society, and in 1855 we declined to undertake the task; but the medals and certificates obtained on both occasions were handed by Government to the Society's keeping.\n\nIt had now its paid Librarian and paid Taxidermist; local Committees had been formed (1852) in Jaffna and Kandy; there were special Committees on Oriental Studies, on Statistics, and on Science; photographic apparatus for photographing temples and other monuments, and electro-plating apparatus for copying coins, had been purchased by the Society.\n\n**A Drawback.**\n\nBut there was one drawback continually felt. The Society suffered, especially from 1851 to 1855, from the want of suitable rooms of its own. It shared rooms with the Loan Board; but these afforded little convenience for keeping the steadily increasing Library and collections. In 1852 it was proposed to join with the Athen\u00e6um\u2014a Society, started in 1850, whose aims were not held to be in conflict or rivalry\nwith our own\u2014and to obtain from Government apartments for the common use of the two Societies. In 1853 the Honorary Secretary, Mr. Layard, suggested that the Society, in co-operation with the Athen\u00e6um, should build with the aid of public subscription.\n\nIt was on November 22, 1852, that the first suggestion\u2014as far as I have been able to trace\u2014of a Museum to be built with the aid of Government was made, in a letter from Kadugann\u00e1wa, by Mr. E. F. Kelaart. But just when the prospects of the Society appeared to be no less brilliant than its actual position, the loss of some of its leading Members brought to light the inherent weakness of all institutions of this kind, the dependence on the zeal of individuals.\n\nIn 1854 Mr. Capper resigned the office of Secretary on leaving the Island. In 1855 very little was done, and in 1856\u2014so short is gratitude, and even memory, in a fluctuating community\u2014the Society could be spoken of as having been \"for some time dormant,\" and as needing to be \"revived.\" No subscription had been collected for two years. The want of a suitable room\u2014the Loan Board being under repair\u2014was no doubt among the causes of this decline; and a room was now rented at \u00a31 a month.\n\nAmong those who at this crisis saved the Society were prominent Mr. C. P. Layard, Mr. W. Skeen, and Dr. Willisford.\n\nThe years 1856\u20131858 however were poor; at a General Meeting in 1857 we find only nine, and in 1858 only seven Members present. Mr. Edgar Layard left for the Cape in 1858; and although in that year Mr. Capper returned to Ceylon the records of satisfactory work continue to be scanty; though a few good Papers were read, notably one in 1862, on the Sinhalese Language, by Mr. Childers.\n\nThe Military Museum.\n\nEnergy was still exhibited, however, in one direction; the efforts for a Museum were continued; and the Military Museum was taken over by the Society in 1862. In the following year Sir Charles Macarthy is represented as\nhaving promised on the part of Government a sum of \u00a3450 (or of \u00a3513) towards the enlargement of the building which the Society used; but for reasons which do not appear in the Society's records this grant was not paid; and in 1865 it seems to have been definitely withdrawn. There can be no doubt that this withdrawal, disappointing as it must have been, was a most fortunate thing; for it left the way open for the execution of a larger scheme.\n\nIn 1869 and 1870 there was a revival of interest. Mr. H. Nevill became Secretary, and many Members joined, among them being, in 1870, Col. A. B. Fyers, R.E., Surveyor-General, to whom, next to its original founders, the Society owes its greatest debt. The two following years produced good Papers: Mr. T. W. Rhys Davids, Mr. L. F. Lee, Mr. Nevill, and Dr. Legge being contributors, also Mr. Capper; and Mr. Louis de Zoysa, afterwards a Mah\u00e1 Mudaliy\u00e1r.\n\nIn 1871 Mr. William Ferguson read a Paper on Reptiles, the first of his many valuable contributions.\n\nThe Founding of the Museum.\n\nWe have now arrived at the time of Sir William Gregory. He became Patron in 1872, and in reply to a deputation led by Col. Fyers, who had become President, expressed himself as favourable to the project of a Museum in the Circular Walk \"in which provision might be made for the Society's Library, and rooms for the Committee, as well as free access to the Museum by Members.\"\n\nThe Annual Meeting of that year, held on November 7, was the occasion of an admirable Presidential Address by Col. Fyers. He had to deplore the loss of Mr. W. Skeen, who had been, he said, a principal pillar of the Society, and the departure of Dr. Legge from Colombo. He gave an able r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the Papers of the year, and, while urging the necessity of a Museum, took care to insist on the privileges which were therein to be reserved for Members of this Society.\nHis Excellency the Governor followed, with language of the warmest encouragement in regard to this scheme, and on June 3 in the following year (1873) His Excellency definitely announced to the Society the intention of Government to proceed with the Museum.\n\nTo the energy and taste of Sir William Gregory the Society and the Colony at large are deeply indebted in this matter; and we must not, in asserting our own share in the work, disparage or ignore his share; but true as it is that but for Sir William Gregory we might have long remained without this Museum, it is no less true that, but for what our Society had done, Sir William would never have built it.\n\nOne of the objects for which the Society had so long been working was thus at last accomplished. As its early efforts at collecting statistics had been crowned by the extension of the Registrar-General's Department in 1867 and its meteorological observations by the addition to the Surveyor-General's Department of a system of observatories dating from 1869, so now its Members had the satisfaction not only of seeing their plan adopted, but of seeing the collections which they and their predecessors had collected and classed, accepted by Government to be the property of the Colony\u2014a monument for ever of the energy and public spirit of this branch of the Asiatic Society.\n\nThis achievement, crowning the labours of such men as Gygax, Kelaart, E. Layard, and Legge, takes rank in our annals, side by side with the brilliant Papers and varied learning which distinguished our Society in its first decade, and with the wise and patient labours devoted to its service by a Capper, a Layard, a Skeen, and a Fyers.\n\nIn the \"Seventies.\"\n\nInstalled in this noble building, in a hall of science which\u2014though the State had built\u2014its own hands had furnished, the Society might now look forward, one would have supposed, to entering at once on a period of far greater activity and popularity than ever. But this was not the case.\nMr. Capper resigned the Secretaryship for the second time in 1873, and Col. Fyers went away on furlough in 1874; and although some excellent Papers were read by Mr. William Ferguson, Dr. Legge, Mr. Louis de Zoysa, Mr. J. d\u2019Alwis, and others, yet both in numbers and in activity the Society seems to have declined.\n\nIt declined in fact so rapidly and remained obscure so long, that a generation had again time to arise, to which its services were unknown, and who really thought that the Colombo Museum had been created from the beginning by the versatile and genial gentleman whose statue\u2014somewhat disfigured though it be for the moment\u2014still adorns these grounds.\n\nCol. Fyers returned in 1877, but even then for a few years longer the torpor continued, Mr. William Ferguson, with a few others, keeping the Society alive.\n\nThe General Meeting of 1879, though scarcely more than a dozen Members attended it, saw a revival. His Excellency Sir J. Longden presided. Col. Fyers gave a spirited Address; and Papers were read by Mr. William Ferguson on Grasses, and by Mr. R. W. Ievers on Paddy Cultivation.\n\nThe Present Time.\n\nAt this point the student of the Society\u2019s history finds himself in the presence of a force which is still at work; and we have already arrived at modern days, when we signalize the all-pervading energy of Mr. H. C. P. Bell.\n\nThis indefatigable Secretary found in 1881 that no proceedings had been published between 1874 and 1880, and obtained leave to complete, by reprinting where necessary, the series of our Journals. All now shows activity. The Rules are amended, the custom of an Annual Report is revived, after being ten years in abeyance; Papers in 1881 and 1882 are abundant. Among the contributors were many whose aid we still enjoy, and other valuable Papers being the work of the late learned Louis de Zoysa and of Professor K\u00fcnte of Bombay.\nInto the record of times more recent I will not enter. The genuine sympathy which Sir A. H. Gordon, now Lord Stanmore, showed to the Society, the great services of the late Sir John F. Dickson, the valuable Papers which under his Presidency were contributed, especially by Members of the Civil Service\u2014these are fresh in the memory of most of us.\n\n*The Outlook; and in Conclusion.*\n\nNor is our present outlook wanting in promise. We have lost many men whom we valued: the names of Ferguson and Wall\u2014to name no others\u2014will be long cherished amongst us; but we are a larger body than at any previous time; and the younger generation will do work\u2014let us not doubt it\u2014as good as ever was done by those who have gone before. Our field of work has indeed been narrowed by the assignment to other agencies of large branches of study; and the work of pioneering has been done, in many directions, once for all. But let us never think that for real students discovery or progress can ever limit the field or close the paths. On the contrary, the more is learnt the more is found to learn, and the range of view is only widened as point after point is gained.\n\nHis Excellency the Lieutenant-Governor said:\u2014\"Ladies and gentlemen,\u2014I am sure that I truly express the feeling of the Members and friends of the Ceylon Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society when I say that they are very grateful to his Lordship for the address which he has given to us with that scholarly ability and that attractiveness which so distinguishes him on these occasions, and which so eminently fits him for the position of President of this Society. (Applause.) The sacrifice of time at the expense of the calls of duty which even his Lordship has to make in preparing such an address as he has read to us must add to our appreciation of the good and kind work which he has done this evening. (Applause.)\n\n\"He has given us a most interesting historical account of the life of the Ceylon Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society. In it I have learned much that I did not know before. I have heard for the first time of the extent to which the Society has been the parent of much work that is now considered within the functions of the Government, and in that respect and to that extent the Government are under a special obligation to the Society. I trust that by the address which has been read by his Lordship, and by the gratifying size of the attendance here, a proper interest will be aroused in the proceedings of the Society.\"\n\"Personally, I regret that my early opportunities and associations have not permitted me to take an active and practical interest in the work of the Society, and as I believe I fill the position of Vice-Patron, I feel the greater rebuke, but I have some comfort in finding that my distinguished predecessor, Sir Emerson Tennent, whose stupendous industry is recorded in the two volumes of his excellent and most useful work of reference on Ceylon, was not able to take any more active part in the transactions of the Society than his humbler follower, myself, has been able to do (laughter).\n\n\"In attending Meetings of the Society, for which Papers were prepared by Members at great sacrifice of time and great trouble, I have regretted to see the comparatively empty benches to which these addresses have been delivered, and I hope that the interest which has been aroused this evening on the occasion of the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Society will bring a larger number together at future Meetings. Those who prepare the addresses may have their reward in the pleasure of their pursuit, but I have not the least doubt that they are not unsusceptible of the sympathy of a large and attentive audience. (Applause.)\n\n\"I was gratified by the reference which his Lordship made to Sir W. Gregory. I can personally testify to the great interest which he took in this building, the father and founder of it as he was, and it was only on the occasion of his last visit here that I with my colleagues on the Museum Committee had the opportunity of seeing practical evidence of the interest which he took in this Institution. When I first came to Ceylon eight years ago I remember that Sir Arthur Gordon, to whom reference has also been made, and who also takes a great interest in the Museum and Asiatic Society, laid considerable emphasis on the trust which I accepted and endeavoured to carry out, by paying as much attention as possible and attending with as much regularity as I could the Meetings of the Committee of Management of the Museum; and the ground on which Sir Arthur Gordon laid this trust on me was the great interest which Sir William Gregory had taken in the building.\n\n\"I wish, ladies and gentlemen, that the advocacy and the emphasizing of what the Bishop has said had been in better hands than mine; but having been told by the Honorary Secretary that the duty fell on me as Vice-Patron, and to a certain extent as being a Member of the Society, of conveying in a few words to his Lordship the acknowledgments which I am sure we all fully and cordially accord, I had no hesitation in accepting the duty, and I am sure, ladies and gentlemen, that I am only expressing your wishes when I convey to his Lordship our thanks for the interesting address which he has given to us.\"\n\nDr. Copleston in replying said:\u2014\"Your Excellency, ladies, and gentlemen,\u2014I should not bring myself before you again even to thank you for so kindly receiving what His Excellency has so kindly said, were it not that I seize the opportunity of expressing the thanks, especially of those to whom the management of the Society's interests are entrusted, and indeed of all of us, to His Excellency for presiding here. (Applause.) We are extremely glad to have him amongst us, and knowing as we do of the difficulty with which those who hold\npositions like his can spare any time to visit us, we are the more grateful for such occasions as this.\n\n\"This Society has never depended upon the patronage of the Governors, as you have seen in the fact that indeed it started without any assistance from the highest quarters, but it has most thankfully received that patronage and assistance, and has very seldom been without it. During my experience of the Society we have had many Governors of the Island, not only kind friends, but actual working Members, especially in the case of Sir Arthur Gordon.\n\n\"I confess that I have been anxious to impress not only upon His Excellency, but upon all representatives of Government and the Civil Service who may be here, how large a part has been taken in the past, and may legitimately be taken in the future, by them in promoting the work of this Society, and how well the Society has earned that by what it has done in paving the way for the more fitting and powerful work of Government itself on the part of the officers of the Society.\n\n\"I most heartily excuse His Excellency the Lieutenant-Governor from continual attendance at our Meetings, but I do think that he should use his influence to induce the Members of the Civil Service, of whom I see one or two brilliant examples who have helped us in the past before me, to repeat and continue that work in the reading of Papers which they are so well qualified to perform.\"\n\nMr. J. Ferguson then rose and said:\u2014\"Your Excellency, ladies, and gentlemen,\u2014I am loth to speak, but I feel that there has been a very great omission in the very able and admirable address we have listened to this evening. It is not an omission which the Members of this Society need to have supplied to them, but in this very large gathering of those who are outside the Ceylon Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society there may be a great number who do not know how very large has been the part borne in the work of the Society, in the reviving of it, in the carrying on of it, and in the taking up of onerous duties year by year by the Right Rev. the Bishop of Colombo (loud applause). That is the omission to which I refer. Since Dr. Copleston came to Ceylon, I may say that he has been to a very large extent the Ceylon Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society (laughter and applause), and I think it would be a very great omission in a review of the period touched on by the Bishop, should there be no reference to that work.\n\n\"It has been quite a pleasure to me to listen to the old names that have been brought forward\u2014the Rev. Dr. MacVicar, who touched nothing in Ceylon with his pen that he did not adorn, and Sir William Gregory, to whom we are very much indebted indeed, because, though we might not have had a Museum if the Society had not suggested it, the Society might have existed one hundred years without the Museum if the Governor had not taken up the matter. Sir William Gregory came to this Colony after having established a high reputation as a critic in regard to the British Museum, the National Gallery, and the Royal Academy, and he brought great influence with him, and great taste in the subjects connected with our Society. He started an interest in Archaeology, and I am sure we owe a very great debt to him when we contrast what he did with what was done in the time of Sir C. Macarthy, who, though he had an overflowing exchequer\nin proportion to his expenditure, allowed the small grant of \u00a3513 to lie without being voted, because of the opinion that nothing should be spent that did not seem to be directly reproductive. Sir William Gregory, however, was able to carry a large vote for this Museum, simply because of his influence and his great interest in the matter.\n\n\"I would only say that it has been a very great gratification to hear other names mentioned\u2014names dear to myself\u2014and the name of my fellow-pressman, Mr. John Capper, of whom it may be said that in those dark years of the Society\u2014\n\nAmong the faithless, faithful only he.\n\nHe worked hard for the Society and kept it alive at a very dark time, as afterwards did Mr. William Ferguson and the others whose names have been mentioned by the Bishop, who I am quite sure has himself done as much for the Society as any man in all the fifty years of its existence.\"\n\nThis terminated the formal proceedings, and the company then dispersed throughout the Museum building.\nJOURNAL\nOF THE\nCEYLON BRANCH\nOF THE\nROYAL ASIATIC SOCIETY,\n1896.\n\nVOLUME XIV.\nNo. 47.\n\nEDITED BY THE HONORARY SECRETARY.\n\nThe design of the Society is to institute and promote inquiries into the History, Religions, Languages, Literature, Arts, and Social Condition of the present and former Inhabitants of the Island, with its Geology and Mineralogy, its Climate and Meteorology, its Botany and Zoology.\n\nCOLOMBO:\nGEORGE J.

White\u2019s Paper on \u201cLegislation in Ceylon in the early portion of the Century\u201d be read.\n\n6. Decided that the business, viz., action regarding defaulting Members, standing in the name of the Honorary Treasurer, be deferred in his absence.\n\n7. Mr. Harward, in proposing that the Director of the Colombo Museum be elected an Honorary Member of the Society, stated that Mr. Haly had contributed some valuable Papers to the Society, had helped the Society in various other ways, and as Director of the Museum had always been of assistance to the Society: apart from these services, Mr. Haly\u2019s official position was a sufficient reason for his election as an Honorary Member.\n\nThe Lord Bishop, President, endorsed what has been stated by Mr. Harward, and remarked that he thought that Mr. Haly, by virtue of his position, should have been elected an Honorary Member before.\n\nResolved to recommend that Mr. A. Haly, Director of the Colombo Museum, be elected an Honorary Member of the Society.\n\n8. The attention of the Council was invited to Rule 35 regarding the appointment of a Standing Committee for the consideration of Papers.\n\nDecided that the matter do stand over for the consideration of the Council of 1896.\n\n9. The Secretaries explained that estimates for the printing of the Society\u2019s Publications, desired by the Council, had been called for, and would probably be submitted at the next Meeting of the Council.\nANNUAL GENERAL MEETING.\n\nColombo Museum, February 10, 1896.\n\nPresent:\n\nThe Lord Bishop of Colombo, President, in the Chair.\n\nMr. J. Alexander. Mr. J. G. C. Mendis.\nMr. D. W. Ferguson. Dr. W. A. de Silva.\nMr. C. M. Fernando. Dr. W. H. de Silva.\nDr. S. Fernando. Rev. F. H. de Winton.\n\nMr. J. Harward and Mr. G. A. Joseph, Honorary Secretaries.\n\nVisitors: three gentlemen.\n\nBusiness.\n\n1. Read and confirmed Minutes of General Meeting held on September 10, 1895.\n\n2. Mr. Harward, on behalf of the Council, read the\u2014\n\nANNUAL REPORT FOR 1895.\n\nThe Council of the Ceylon Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society have the honour to lay before this Meeting their Annual Report for the year 1895.\n\nMeetings.\n\nThree General Meetings of this Society have been held during the year, at which the following Papers were read:\u2014\n\n(1) \"Puran\u0101\u1e47\u016bru,\" by the Hon. P. Coom\u0101rasw\u0101my.\n(2) \"King \u015aekku\u1e6d\u1e6duvan of the Chera Dynasty,\" by the Hon. P. Coom\u0101rasw\u0101my.\n(3) \"Interim Report on the Operations of the Archaeological Survey at Sigiriya in 1895,\" by H. C. P. Bell., c.c.s., Archaeological Commissioner.\n\nConversazione.\n\nOn December 13, 1895, the Society celebrated its Jubilee by holding a Conversazione. The Lord Bishop of Colombo, President, delivered an Address, giving a sketch of the early history of the Society.\n\nAn account of this very successful gathering will be found in the Society's Journal for 1895. The Council take this opportunity of tendering their thanks both to those who subscribed towards the expense, and to those who took part in organizing the entertainment.\n\nMembers.\n\nThe number of Members of the Society is now 203. Of these, 8 are Honorary Members, 17 Life Members, and 178 Ordinary Members.\nDuring the year 1895 there were elected five Ordinary Members, viz., Drs. P. M. Muttukum\u0101ru and C. G. Jayawardana, and Messrs. Le\u00f3n d'Espagnac, H. Tiruvilangam, and J. G. C. Mendis; and one Non-Resident Member, Mr. Chiezo Tokuzawa, Sanskrit Scholar commissioned by the Western Hongwanji College, Japan.\n\nThree Members have resigned:\u2014Messrs. F. Dornhorst, J. H. Sproule, and J. T. Morgan.\n\nThe Council regret to record the death of the following Members, viz.:\u2014C. P. Dias Bandaranayake, Mah\u00e1 Mudaliy\u00e1r; Rev. J. Scott, of the Wesleyan Mission.\n\nSubscriptions.\n\nThe Council note with dissatisfaction that there is much irregularity on the part of some Members in the payment of their subscription, in spite of frequent applications made by the Honorary Treasurer. It has been decided that in future no publications will be forwarded to Members who have not paid their entrance fee and first subscription; and Rule 32 will be strictly enforced with regard to Members whose subscriptions are in arrear.\n\nLibrary.\n\nThe number of volumes, including separate parts of periodicals added to the Society's Library, was 140. All of these were either presentations, or were received in exchange for the Society's publications. The Library is indebted for additions to the Trustees of the Indian Museum; the Ceylon Government; the Government of Madras; the Director of Public Instruction, Ceylon; R\u00e1j\u00e1 Sir Sourindo Mohun Tagore, Kt.; E. J. G. Perera; the Editor of the \"Octagon.\"\n\nThe want of additional room for books has been long felt, and special attention has been drawn to this point in previous Reports. The shelves are quite full, and in the present room there is no space for additional cases. Government has admitted the need for more accommodation; and it is to be hoped that the long-delayed extension of the Museum building may be taken in hand this year.\n\nThere are at present over 200 books stored away in cupboards for want of room, and some of the periodical publications have been ranged in double rows on the shelves. In spite of these measures there is no room available, and recent numbers of Journals cannot be placed on the shelves with the sets to which they belong. Both the Museum Library and that of the Asiatic Society require additional space, not only for present requirements, but to allow for future development.\n\nThe Society derives much benefit from the exchange of publications with other learned Societies. Many important additions to its shelves are made by this means, and the Society is placed in correspondence with many of the great Scientific Institutions and learned Societies in the world.\n\nThe following is a list of the Societies and Institutions now on the exchange list, viz.:\u2014The Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland; the Royal Society of Victoria; the Indian Museum; the Wagner Institute of Sciences; the Buddhist Text Society of India; Genootschap van Kunsten en Wetenschappen; the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society; the Anthropological Society of Great Britain and Ireland; the Anthropological Society of\nBombay; John Hopkins' University; the Royal Colonial Institute; Deutsche Morgenl\u00e4ndische Gesellschaft; the Smithsonian Institution; the Royal Geographical Society of London; the Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia; the Academy of Natural Sciences, California; the Zoological Society of London; the China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society; the American Oriental Society; the Asiatic Society of Bengal; the Madras Literary Society; the Geological and Natural History Survey of Canada; the Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society; the Royal Society of New South Wales; Bijdragen tot de Taal, Land en Volkenkunde van Nederlandsch Indie K. K. Naturhistorischen Hofmuseums; the Asiatic Society of Japan; Mus\u00e9e Guimet; the Geological Society of London; Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Imp\u00e9riale des Naturalistes de Moscow; the University of Upsala; the Bureau of Education, Washington; the Geological Survey of United States of America; the Oriental Society of Pekin; Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Zoologique, Paris.\n\nJournals.\n\nOne number of the Society's Journal has been published during the year, viz.:\u2014\n\nVol. III., No. 45, 1894, containing the following Papers:\u2014\n\n(1) \"Notes on the Species and Varieties of Testudo in the Colombo Museum,\" with illustrations, by A. Haly, Director of the Colombo Museum.\n\n(2) \"Note on a Sinhalese Inscription of 1745\u201346 A.D.,\" by D. M. de Z. Wickremasinghe.\n\n(3) \"Kostantinu Hatana,\" by F. W. de Silva, Mudaliy\u00e1r.\n\n(4) \"Which Gaga B\u0101hu visited India?\" by W. P. Ranasingha.\n\n(5) \"Archaeology of the Wanni,\" by J. P. Lewis, C.C.S.\n\n(6) \"The Music of Ceylon,\" by C. M. Fernando, B.A., LL.B., Advocate.\n\n(7) \"A Half-hour with two Ancient Tamil Poets,\" by the Hon. P. Coom\u00e1rasw\u00e1my.\n\nThe Journal for 1895 is also ready, and an advance copy is laid on the table this evening.\n\nOther Publications.\n\nThe Index to the Journals, Vols. I.\u2013XI., comprising Nos. 1\u201341, 1845\u201390, compiled by Mr. J. F. W. Gore, was issued in the early part of the year. This useful work was fully described in the Annual Report for 1894.\n\nA new Catalogue of the Library, which had been for some time in preparation, was issued in December, 1895. Compiled with great care, it supplies a want much felt since the edition of the last Catalogue was exhausted some years ago. It will prove of great help to those who wish to use the Society's Library.\n\nPrinting of the Society's Publications.\n\nThe Council report with regret that the Government have decided to impose an additional charge of 30 per cent. on all publications of the Society printed at the Government Press.\n\nUp to the year 1881 all the Society's publications were printed by Government free of charge. The privilege was withdrawn in\n1881, and one volume of the Journal was printed by a private firm. This experiment was found to be too costly for the Society\u2019s funds; and in 1883 another appeal was made for Government help. The Society was then allowed to have its Journal printed at the Government Press on payment of the compositors\u2019 charges and price of paper.\n\nThis privilege has been enjoyed continuously from 1883 to 1895, and, as no very cogent reason has been given for its withdrawal, the Council hope that the Government will reconsider the question of imposing a charge which so seriously hampers the Society\u2019s work.\n\nArchaeology.\n\nThe Council has again to thank the Archaeological Commissioner for a short resum\u00e9 of the operations of the Archaeological Survey during the past year.\n\nOwing to the curtailment of the Archaeological Vote last year, operations had to be more restricted than in 1894. No excavations were attempted for three months during the dry season.\n\nThe actual work done during 1895 was briefly as follows:\n\nSigiriya.\u2014Commencement of the survey of \u201cS\u00edgiri Nuwara\u201d and of excavations both on the summit of and below the Great Rock. Roughly speaking, about one-third of the site of the ancient city, or fortress, was cleared of undergrowth: on the top of S\u00edgiri-gala, and round its base, perhaps a fourth of the passages, walls, &c., has been laid bare. A summary of the work at S\u00edgiriya in 1895 was placed before the Asiatic Society in the Archaeological Commissioner\u2019s \u201cInterim Report\u201d to the Government on the operations of the Archaeological Survey between February 24 and May 12.\n\nA fresh start will be made at this interesting site next February.\n\nAnur\u00e1dhapura.\u2014(a) Toluvila.\u2014Some additional ruins were discovered here early in the year\u2014one an elliptical building\u2014and dealt with. The excavation of the whole of the Toluvila group is now finished. This monastery rivals in completeness and interest any yet exposed at Anur\u00e1dhapura.\n\n(b) S\u00e9la Chaitiya D\u00e1gaba,\u2014This little d\u00e1gaba mound, lying between Ruwanv\u00e9li S\u00e9ya and Abhayagiriya D\u00e1gaba, was dug into.\n\nIt proves to be of the \u201cVijay\u00e1rama\u201d type, with a boldly moulded platform of stone slabs, all in situ, but displaced. Its restoration by the Buddhist community is said to be contemplated. If properly restored, the S\u00e9la Chaitiya will be one of the most attractive shrines at Anur\u00e1dhapura.\n\n(c) A small ruined basement of quartz, with elephant and lion head dado, was unearthed in private land close to the Kurun\u00e9gala road half a mile from the town, late in 1894. This ruin has been further excavated, and has yielded some fine carvings and fragments of a \u201cBuddhist-rail.\u201d\n\n(d) Th\u00fap\u00e1r\u00e1ma.\u2014Main attention has been given to the complete excavation of the buildings surrounding this D\u00e1gaba. The small mound, popularly styled \u201cSa\u1e45ghamitt\u00e1\u2019s Tomb,\u201d and a second mound, very similar, proved to have been rifled centuries ago. Among the chief buildings belonging to Th\u00fap\u00e1r\u00e1ma are the \u201cD\u00e1l\u00e1d\u00e1 M\u00e1li-gawa,\u201d and the fine pillared \u201cpansala\u201d of the monks. All have been cleanly dug; and in addition about half of the high brick wall encircling the ancient D\u00e1gaba itself has been exposed to view.\nCircuit Work.\u2014The Archaeological Commissioner carried out during August and September an extensive tour through the Kiralawa, Unduruwa, N\u00e9gampaha, Kal\u00e1gama, and Epp\u00e1wala K\u00f3ral\u00e9s of the North-Central Province; crossing also into the North-Western Province, chiefly in order to examine the little known caves, &c., at S\u0113s\u0113ruwa.\n\nTen days were spent in copying the numerous cave inscriptions at, and near, this hill; and in photographing, drawing, and taking full measurements of the ruins, inclusive of the colossal rock-cut Buddha, which stands 33 ft. from head to foot.\n\nLater in the circuit similar work was done at Aukana near Kal\u00e1vewa, where another giant-granite Buddha of equal height occurs.\n\nEpigraphical.\u2014Many unrecorded inscriptions met with whilst on tour were copied and photographed by the Archaeological Commissioner; whilst his Head Overseer was engaged in taking ink impressions of those examined between 1891\u201393 in the North and North-East K\u00f3ral\u00e9s of the North-Central Province.\n\nOffice of Treasurer.\n\nThe office of Treasurer was taken up by Mr. F. C. Roles in the month of August, in succession to Mr. A. P. Green.\n\nFinances.\n\nThe Society's accounts for the year 1895 have been kindly audited by Mr. E. Booth. A balance sheet is attached to the Report, which shows that the financial condition of the Society is satisfactory. The rather large turnover for the year is due to the adjustment of some old items on both sides of the account. The Anur\u00e1dhapura Excavation Account has been finally closed, and the balance handed over to the Archaeological Commissioner. Writing on January 21, the Honorary Treasurer reports that the total amount of the Society's outstanding liabilities is under Rs. 50, and that none of these date back further than December, 1895.\n\nGeneral Account for 1895.\n\n| Receipts                                      | Rs. c. |\n|----------------------------------------------|-------|\n| Balance, General Revenue Account              | 681 67|\n| Sale of Journals                              | 196 96|\n| Life Members                                 | 207 50|\n| Entrance Fees                                 | 42 0  |\n\n| Subscriptions, 1891                          | 10 50 |\n| Do. 1892                                     | 63 0  |\n| Do. 1893                                     | 346 50|\n| Do. 1894                                     | 787 50|\n| Do. 1895                                     | 1,450 50|\n| Do. 1896                                     | 42 0  |\n\nTotal ... 3,828 13\nExpenditure.\n\n| Description                          | Rs.  |\n|--------------------------------------|------|\n| Books (old accounts)                 | 116 29 |\n| Charges                              | 1,095 96 |\n| Printing                             | 2,470 34 |\n| Conversazione (unclosed account)     | 19 66 |\n| Balance (Bank of Madras)             | 125 88 |\n| **Total**                            | **3,828 13** |\n\nF.

Booth.\n\nFebruary 3, 1896.\nMr. D. W. Ferguson proposed the adoption of the Report. On the whole, it was satisfactory. The only really unsatisfactory part was with reference to the Members who had not paid their subscriptions for many years. He did not think the number had been stated, but he hoped it was not large. From the Proceedings of last year he noticed that it was proposed that steps should be taken to recover the amount by law; but it was found that that was impossible without the signatures of all the Members of the Society. It was a great pity if such was the case; and he hoped some of the amount might be recovered by appealing to the honour of the gentlemen who were in arrears. If not, he was of opinion that some steps should be taken to have their names published, so that others might take warning. He concluded by moving the adoption of the Report.\n\nMr. Mendis seconded, and the Report was adopted.\n\n3. The Rev. F. H. de Winton said:\u2014He had much pleasure in proposing the following names of gentlemen to be elected Office-Bearers for the current year:\n\nPresident.\u2014The Right Rev. the Lord Bishop of Colombo.\n\nVice-Presidents.\u2014The Hon. Mr. Justice Lawrie and Mr. Staniforth Green.\n\nCouncil.\n\nHon. P. Coom\u00e1rasw\u00e1my. Mr. P. R\u00e1man\u00e1than, C.M.G.\nMr. J. Ferguson. Mr. W. P. Ranasingha.\nMr. C. M. Fernando. Mr. E. S. W. S\u00e9na\u00edthi R\u00e1j\u00e1.\nMr. P. Fre\u00fcdenberg. Mr. H. F. Tomalin, A.R.I.B.A.\nMr. F. M. Mackwood. Dr. H. Trimen.\nMr. F. H. Price. Dr. W. G. Vandort.\n\nHonorary Treasurer.\u2014Mr. F. C. Roles.\n\nHonorary Secretaries.\u2014Mr. H. C. P. Bell, c.c.s.; Mr. J. Harward, M.A.; and Mr. G. A. Joseph.\n\nMr. D. W. Ferguson seconded, and the list was carried unanimously.\n\nThe President returned thanks on behalf of those to whom honour had been done by electing them Office-Bearers of the Society for the current year. Many of them had held office during the past year, and it was not altogether unsuitable that he should say one or two words in recognition of the services which the officers of the past year had rendered.\n\nA Society like theirs depended for its vitality almost entirely upon the energy of its Secretaries and its Treasurer; and the amount of work the Secretaries had done for the Society was really very considerable, and deserved the gratitude of all who in any degree valued the Society.\n\nThe preparation of the Society\u2019s Journals, seeing them through the Press, the management and preparation of Meetings, and, in particular, the important conversazione held not long ago, a very considerable correspondence, the compilation by one of the Secretaries of a Catalogue of the Library,\u2014these were all services which involved no small labour on the part of those gentlemen who had placed their time at the disposal of the Society; and the fact that their Journals were so completely up to date showed how thoroughly their Secretaries had done their work. That they were re-elected to office was\nonly an expression of the confidence of the Society and the gratitude of the Members.\n\nThe Treasurer also ought not to be forgotten. The office he discharged was in some respects not only a burdensome one, but an unpleasant one. It was, unfortunately, his duty to be reminding Members of the necessity of paying their subscriptions; and he had asked him (the Chairman), thinking perhaps that there would be an opportunity, of reading a lecture to less attentive and deserving Members\u2014which of course were those not present that night\u2014to say something on this point, and to ask the assistance of Members of the Society to remove to some extent that part of his labours which consisted in continual writing for subscriptions. Members, the Secretary told him, were not in the habit of sending in subscriptions until they had been asked once. Such were considered admirable Members. The Rules of the Society provided that subscriptions should be paid in March, without demand, and he made the request that Members would give effect to it.\n\n4. Mr. Harward, on behalf of the Council, moved that Mr. A. Haly, Director of the Colombo Museum, be elected an Honorary Member of the Society. He referred to the relations existing between the Society and the Museum, and to the services which had been rendered to the Society by Mr. Haly. That gentleman had many claims to be elected a Member. He had done a large amount of work for the Society in the way of contributing Papers of much real scientific value. The list of his Papers was as follows:\n\nJanuary 26, 1888.\u2014Lecture \u201cOn the Characters of Ceylon Snakes.\u201d Published in Vol. X. of the Society\u2019s Journal.\n\nJanuary 26, 1888.\u2014\u201cEssay on the Construction of Zoological Tables,\u201d with a Tabular Diagnosis of the Snakes of Ceylon. Published in Vol. XI.\n\nSeptember 30, 1891.\u2014\u201cA New Method of Preserving and Mounting Zoological Specimens.\u201d Published in Vol. XII.\n\nJuly 7, 1894.\u2014\u201cNotes on the Species and Varieties of Testudo in the Colombo Museum.\u201d Published in Vol. XIII.\n\nOn account of these contributions, and on the ground of his position as Director of the Colombo Museum, and of the services he had rendered, Mr. Harward proposed that Mr. Haly be elected an Honorary Member.\n\nMr. C. M. Fernando seconded, remarking that it had come to him as a surprise that Mr. Haly was not already an Honorary Member of the Society; and he held that the close connection between the Museum and the Society should be perpetuated in this manner.\n\nMr. Haly was declared unanimously elected.\n\n5. Mr. Harward read the following Paper:\u2014\nLEGISLATION IN CEYLON IN THE EARLY PORTION OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY.*\n\nBy H. White, c.c.s.\n\nIn a few months' time a full century will have elapsed since the English first occupied the maritime provinces of this Island, Colombo having capitulated on February 15, 1796. Some are doubtless reckoning the commercial, some the agricultural, some the educational, and some the moral progress made during the century.\n\nIn looking over the first volume of the Legislative Acts of the Ceylon Government, a volume which embraces the period from 1796 to the promulgation of the Charter in 1833, it occurred to me that it would be interesting to note what an immense gulf separates the legislation of to-day from the legislation of that period, both in its form and in its aims.\n\nThis volume contains 400 printed pages of Proclamations and Regulations, as what are now called Ordinances were then styled, many hundreds in number. Only thirteen of them now appear in the latest edition of our laws. Some of them were useful, some useless, a good many are amusing\u2014all are interesting. Let us examine some of them.\n\nIn this volume we find Proclamations that might have been issued by Cromwell, sumptuary regulations resembling those of the Tudors and Stewarts, a police force that reminds us of Dogberry and Verges, and Protectionist Acts regulating the price of bread, mingled with minatory exhortations to the people, which they apparently regarded with philosophic indifference.\n\nBy the Proclamation of September 23, 1799, torture against persons suspected of crimes, and punishment after\n\n* A Paper on similar lines by Mr. J. P. Lewis, c.c.s., entitled \"Dutch Rule in Ceylon,\" appeared in the Ceylon Literary Register, Vol. III., 1888-89, pp. 350, 356, 364, &c.\u2014B., Hon. Sec.\nconviction in capital cases by breaking on the wheel and other barbarous modes of execution, were abolished. Capital punishment by hanging was ordained, but the privilege was reserved to those who preferred it of petitioning the Governor to be allowed to suffer decapitation instead. The same Proclamation abolished the practice of procuring confession by torture.\n\nBy the Proclamation of January 30, 1800, branding on the hand with a hot iron was ordained as the punishment for certain offences.\n\nThe following is an excellent specimen of the minatory exhortations. It is dated January 20, 1800:\n\nWhereas we have heard with great astonishment and displeasure that, notwithstanding our Proclamation of November 19, 1799, none of the inhabitants of the Marendhan have produced their titles, and whereas we will not allow our orders to be slighted or disobeyed........ We do further declare that all persons convicted of deluding the said inhabitants and encouraging them to persist in their disobedience will feel the weight of our severest displeasure.\n\nHere is another dated June 13, 1800:\n\nWhereas we have heard with the greatest surprise and concern that certain inhabitants of the District of Mann\u00e1r, instigated, as we suppose, by evil-minded persons, have assembled together and declared their intention not to obey our just authority in the payment of the light and equitable tax which we have imposed on those persons who choose to wear joys and ornaments. We hereby make known and declare that to curb so wicked and refractory a spirit, and to support, as we always shall, the authority with which we are duly invested, we have ordered a military force to march into the said district, and that it is our intention to take exemplary vengeance on such as (after the promulgation of these presents) do not disperse and return to their own homes and submit as good and peaceable subjects to the operation of the aforesaid tax, and of the wholesome and salutary laws which we have enacted for the good of the inhabitants of these settlements, and which we are determined to enforce by the full exercise of the power which is lodged in our hands.\n\nThese fulminations are signed by William Boyd, Acting Secretary to Government, and not, as one would expect from the text, by Queen Elizabeth.\nThe Proclamation of September 23, 1799, might have been issued by Cromwell, except for the fact that he was dead at the time. It runs:\n\nAnd we do hereby allow liberty of conscience and the free exercise of religious worship to all persons who inhabit and frequent the said settlements of the Island of Ceylon, provided always that they peaceably and quietly enjoy the same without offence and scandal to Government; but we command and ordain that no new place of religious worship be established without our license or authority first had and obtained. And we do hereby command that no person shall be allowed to keep a school in any of the said settlements of the Island of Ceylon without our license first had and obtained, in granting of which we shall pay the most particular attention to the morals and proper qualification of the persons applying for the same. And we do hereby, in His Majesty's name, require and command all officers, civil and military, and all other inhabitants of the said settlements, that in the execution of the several powers, jurisdictions, and authorities hereby and by His Majesty's command erected, created, and made or revised and enforced, they be aiding, and assisting, and obedient in all things, as they will answer the contrary at their peril.\n\nIn 1801 appeared the following piece of strictly domestic legislation:\n\nWhereas we have reason to believe that the domestic slaves in many families within this city and its neighbourhood have lately shown a disposition to mutiny and disobedience of the just authority of their masters and mistresses, we hereby make known and declare that all such slaves as bring false and frivolous complaints to us or to the Magistrates under us will be summarily and severely punished, and we at the same time enjoin all masters and mistresses to be particularly careful not to detain slaves for whom they have no sufficient title, and to restrain the correction of their slaves within the limit of the law and the bounds which are necessary for the preservation of good order within their families.\n\nThis reminds one of Isaak Walton's exhortation to the angler when baiting his hook, \"to treat the worm tenderly as if he loved him.\"\n\nWhile on the subject of slaves it is curious to note that against decisions regarding the ownership of slaves the Regulation No. 7 of 1806 enacted that there should be an appeal, provided the value of the slave was of an appealable nature.\nThe Protectionist Regulation No. 11 of 1806 must have necessitated the use of the book of logarithms in every \"hopper\" boutique. Article 4 runs:\n\nThe smallest loaf or muffin shall weigh four ounces Dutch. When a bag of wheat shall exceed the price of nine rix dollars, but not exceed twelve, then the muffin shall not be sold for more than three pice and a half.\n\nThere was, moreover, a tax on ornaments, facetiously styled the \"Joy* Tax,\" which was rented like the arrack farms now-a-days.\n\nIn spite of its name it was not popular. In June, 1800, certain inhabitants of Negombo assembled in a riotous and unlawful manner, insulted the renter of the \"Joy tax\" and put him in fear of his life. A force of soldiers was despatched to the scene. The Proclamation which tells us this enacts that the wearing of a comb made of horn would not subject any person to the payment of the tax.\n\nIn the present day there is an export duty on combs made of horn paid by passengers, in the fond belief that they are made of tortoise-shell.\n\nWhile speaking of ornaments, it should be noted that the red cap of the policeman first appeared above the horizon in 1806. Regulation No. 6 of 1806 enacts that as the number of robberies and other offences of late committed render it necessary that some police regulations should be immediately made, there shall be one or more headmen called \"police officers\" in each of the villages within the British settlements. In 1807 the Pettah and gravets of Colombo were divided into fifteen streets, and twenty-eight constables were appointed, equipped with rattles, for the more speedy summoning of the neighbours and other constables. Their duties were to seize all persons troubling the public repose, to take particular care that all billiard houses were punctually shut up at 10 o'clock at night, and that keepers of billiard tables took licenses from the Sitting Magistrates\n\n* Of course a corruption of Fr. joyau.\u2014B., Hon. Sec.\nbefore whom they had to make oath not to suffer disorderly conduct to take place in their houses. The more to prevent licentious debauchery of youth, no debts, either for gambling or liquors used there, were recoverable at law. These constables with their rattles had also to look after the butcher and the baker and the drains, and to put out fires. Doubtless, if the archives of the police office were overhauled many a complaint would be unearthed that P. C. Tweedle Dum had stolen the nice new rattle of P. C. Tweedle Dee. These constables were allowed 10 per cent. of the value of stolen property recovered by them. I believe they generally died in poverty. (The next Regulation but one is for the relief of bankrupts.)\n\nIn 1812 the Collector of Galle was ordered to make a special circuit in Galle and M\u00e1tara, which were declared to be infested with numerous and daring gangs of robbers.\n\nIn 1813 the new police were introduced into Galle, Trincomalee, and Jaffna; in 1815 into Mann\u00e1r: Negombo got them in 1819; and M\u00e1tara in 1820.\n\nIn 1812 compensation for the loss in exchange between rix dollars and pounds sterling was granted to the European officers and soldiers, and to the Civil Service in lieu of certain advantages, among which was the privilege of landing wine and other articles free of Customs duty. This privilege was probably a very valuable one in those days, when heavy drinking of wine went on to an extent quite unknown now. The four-ounce muffin was washed down with copious libations of Port and Madeira. The rates of port charges specify the cooly hire for landing pipes of Port and Madeira. I do not fancy that much of either is drunk now.\n\nWhile speaking of diet, I should mention that in 1824 the catching of sardines during December and January at Trincomalee was prohibited. Is it to be presumed that there was a Sardine Fund and Committee in those early days, answering to our Trout Fund?\n\nA curious law appeared in 1806. It enacted that all persons of whatever description in the Province of Jaffna who\nmight be committed to hard labour should be employed in the improvement of the church to which they belonged or of some adjacent church.\n\nIn 1811 the privilege of trial by jury was extended to the Dutch and to the natives.\n\nThe germ of the Municipal Council of Colombo is found in the Regulation No. 5 of 1820. It established an assessment on houses in the Fort town and Four Gravets of Colombo for the purpose of keeping the roads in good repair and providing lights therein, and also transferred to the Collector's Department for the same purposes the amount collected for licenses on bullock bandies. Galle followed suit in 1824.\n\nIn 1822, not long after the cession of the Kandyan Provinces, appeared the germ of our Forest Ordinance.\n\nIn 1826 hanging was substituted for drowning as capital punishment for females in the Kandyan Provinces.\n\nThe Regulation No. 2 of 1828 required every one to send in to Government a return of the number of elephants he, she, or they were possessed of.\n\nThe Regulation No. 2 of 1832 repealed the Dutch Proclamation prohibiting Moormen and Malabars from possessing houses and grounds within the Fort and Pettah of Colombo.\n\nRegulation No. 4 of 1833 dealt with the lately established Ceylon Savings Bank.\n\nThe volume closes with an Index to the Legislative Acts of the Dutch Government, which almost tempts one to learn Dutch.*\n\nOne of them fixes the price of coffins, another prohibits galloping on horseback or in chariots in the Fort, and another orders all natives to proceed to their K\u00f3ral\u00e9s and Pattus on pain of being put in chains for the space of three years.\n\n* Mr. White, unwittingly, proceeds to trench on ground already covered by Mr. Lewis's Paper. See ante, p. 11, Note.*\u2014B., Hon. Sec.\nOne Proclamation is said by the Index to contain the privileges allowed to washermen and their wives professing the reformed religion, and another prohibits the grazing of animals, except horses, in the streets of the Fort.\n\nThe Proclamation of May 26, 1723, proclaims that those that are found guilty of robbery are to be for the first offence whipped and branded and put to hard labour in chains for the space of twenty-five years, and for the second offence to be hanged; and the Ordinance of August 24, 1746, prohibits people from going from one place to another without leave.\n\nThe advertisement of December 14, 1756, prohibits the trade in blue linen, and that of January 8, 1757, declares the coins called blue stivers to be current.\n\nAnother prohibits the carrying of copper money from one place to another throughout Ceylon. Natives were prohibited from offending Europeans in any manner whatsoever on pain of being whipped, branded, and put in chains.\n\nTo quote more would be monstrous long, and not to be endured.\n\nA discussion followed the reading of the Paper, in which Messrs. C. M. Fernando, J. G. C. Mendis, D. W. Ferguson, J. Harward, and Rev. F. H. de Winton took part.\n\n6. A vote of thanks was passed to Mr. H. White for his Paper, on a motion proposed by Mr. D. W. Ferguson and seconded by Mr. G. A. Joseph.\n\n7.

Laid on the table estimates for printing the publications of the Society called for by the Council, in view of the 30 per cent. added by the Government Printer from the beginning of the current year.\n\nResolved,\u2014That as the printing of the publications, even with the 30 per cent. added by the Government Printer, would be cheaper than entrusting the work to a private firm, the Society do continue to have its publications printed at the Government Press.\n\n4. The attention of the Council was directed to Rule 35 regarding the appointment of a Standing Committee for the consideration of Papers.\n\nResolved,\u2014On the motion of Mr. Justice Lawrie seconded by Mr. Sen\u00e1thi R\u00e1j\u00e1, that the Members of the Council do form a Standing Committee under Rule 35.\n\n5.

Joseph, Honorary Secretaries.\n\nVisitors: six gentlemen and two ladies.\n\nBusiness.\n\n1. Read and confirmed Minutes of Annual General Meeting held on February 10, 1896.\n\n2. Mr. Harward read the following Paper:\u2014\nThe Extremities of a Nematoid Parasite from the Abdomen or of a Ceylon Insect. (Mantis religiosa) highly magnified.\nON A CURIOUS NEMATOID PARASITE FROM THE STOMACH OF A CEYLON INSECT (MANTIS RELIGIOSA).\n\nBy O. COLLETT, F.R.M.S.\n\nI HAVE recently sent to the Colombo Museum a specimen of a female Mantis, which was taken in the Gampola district of Ceylon last September.\n\nIn the stomach of this insect I found a curious parasite of remarkable length; and acting upon the suggestion of Mr. A. Haly (the Director), who thinks that the case is one worthy of record, I have written a short description of the animal to lay before this Society, in the hope that the subject may be considered of some interest.\n\nThe Mantis from which the parasite was taken was nearly full grown. It measured $2\\frac{3}{4}$ inches in length from front of head to tip of tail, and four inches in breadth across the outstretched wing-cases. Its abdomen measured one inch long and half an inch in width. It seems incredible then that in the stomach of this insect there should have lived a parasitic worm measuring one-thirtieth of an inch in diameter, and no less than two feet three and a half inches in length. Indeed; the length of the parasite was equal to almost twelve times that of the entire body of its host!\n\nThe animal is an aproctous nematode of the family Mermithidia. It may be described as follows:\n\nThe body: long, smooth, and cylindrical, narrowed at the anterior end; the other extremity being slightly flattened, and ending in a short, curved point.\n\nColour: an opaque milky white, changing to bright yellow near the tail.\n\nSkin: smooth and shiny; the ringed structure of the cuticle, which often occurs in species of this kind, is very apparent when the animal is mounted in balsam. The skin\nwas covered with a thin coat of transparent mucus. This, however, was unfortunately destroyed by the action of the Formalin solution in which I at first attempted to preserve the specimen, so that no trace of it now remains.\n\nBeneath the skin lie two or three layers of longitudinal muscular fibre, also the usual inner circular series of the same. These enabled the animal to increase or shorten its length considerably, its body after death measuring nearly two inches longer than while it was alive.\n\nThe body is hollow, furnished with one pore at the anterior end. This represents the mouth, which is simple and unarmed. A little below the mouth lie the four oval papillae marked AA in the drawing.\n\nBy means of these the animal clings on to its host during its parasitic life, and they afterwards serve as organs of sexual attachment, when the animal becomes free.\n\nThe mouth appears to lead immediately into a long intestinal canal, which runs through the entire length of the body, and has no anal opening. At a point just above the tip of the tail, marked B, is the outlet of the excretory canals. These canals run back one on each side of the intestinal canal for a considerable distance.\n\nThe animal has no circulating apparatus. The drawing represents the appearance of the extremities of the animal magnified ($\\times 200$) under the microscope, after they had been rendered partly transparent by the action of glycerine, &c. A perusal of this drawing may help to make the above short description more intelligible.\n\nMr. Haly, Director of the Colombo Museum, who has been kind enough to read over this Paper, is of opinion that the animal is one of those which, according to Claus, live in the body cavity of insects, finally escaping into damp earth, when they attain maturity and breed.\n\n3. Mr. Harward next read a Paper entitled:\u2014\nHOW THE LAST KING OF KANDY WAS CAPTURED BY THE BRITISH:\n\nAn Eye-witness's account, rendered from the Sinhalese.\n\nBY T. B. POHATH.\n\nPreface.\n\nThis account I have translated for the Society from a letter contributed by D. V. A. Dias, the Interpreter who accompanied the British Troops who captured the king and suppressed the Keppitipola rebellion. Dias was an eye-witness of these occurrences, and he embodied his personal experiences in a series of letters to a Sinhalese magazine then current in Ceylon, entitled \"Sinhala Sanghrawa.\" It was a periodical of great repute printed in the year 1860, and ably conducted by a pandit of the day. The note I have the honour to contribute today is one of them, and appeared in the April issue of that magazine in the year 1861. I beg to append the Sinhalese copy of the original for verification.*\n\nI have gone a little beyond the limits of the original and touched, in the concluding paragraphs, upon the Kandyan-English Convention of 1815, the leading persons interested in the capture of the king, his deportation, and death. I have also added a few explanatory notes to the Paper, and have to crave the Society's indulgence for any shortcomings.\n\n* (i) Any \"Interpreter\" selected by the English authorities to accompany troops on an affair of such moment as the capture of the Kandyan King would be, say, 30 to 35 years of age at least. If alive in 1860 he would therefore be 75 to 80 years old!\n\n(ii) A trusty correspondent writes:\u2014\"I have searched the Ceylon Government Gazette of 1815 but find no mention of 'D. V. A. Dias.' Nor can I find his name in the Ceylon Calendar for 1815. The 'eye-witness's account' communicated by Mr. T. B. Pohath looks very suspicious, though it may possibly be genuine.\"\n\n(iii) The King was captured in 1815: the Keppitipola (\"Uva\") rebellion occurred in 1817-18.\n\nOn present evidence the Paper looks like a compilation of later days foisted on to one \"Dias,\" of which ilk there were two Titular Muhandirams and one Mudaliyar and Second Sinhalese Interpreter in 1817 (Ceylon Calendar).\u2014B., Hon. Sec.\nHOW THE LAST KING OF KANDY* WAS CAPTURED BY THE BRITISH.\n\nThe English regiment which was commissioned to capture the king started out in several bodies to Kandy. The detachment I accompanied consisted of about 800 Sepoys, Malays, and Bengalis, commanded by Captain De Bushe, Lieutenant Sethan, Ensign Kelaart, the three Kandyan Mohott\u00e1las, Kawdumanne, Thorawature, and Karudumanne, and two Captains, Creasy and Kuppan\u2014the latter being a Malay officer. While we were marching through N\u00e1gahagedara, a village within the jurisdiction of Lower Dolospattuwa of Seven K\u00f3ral\u00e9s, some opposition was shown us by some Kandyans under a Nayakkar\u2019s\u2020 command. Having won in the skirmish, we continued our march to Kurun\u00e9gala, and thence left for M\u00e1tal\u00e9 via Upper Dolospattuwa. From this station we were passing down to Kandy through Gongawela road, and on reaching the new ferry at Alutgama we were met by Mr. D\u2019Oyly, Colonels Hardy and Hooke, and a large number of mounted orderlies, captains, and officers, together with a vast assemblage of English, Bengali, Sepoy, and Malay soldiers, including the two Ad\u00edg\u00e1rs,\n\n* The prerogative of nominating a successor to a vacant throne generally rested with the Chief Prime Minister, with the concurrence of Chiefs; particularly when there was a break in the natural line of inheritance. The lot fell on Pilima Talawwa, who, according to Tennent, was considered the most illustrious of the lords who claimed royal descent. Some of the Chiefs backed up Buddhasamy, alias Muttusamy, but the Ad\u00edg\u00e1r strongly advocated the cause of Kannasamy (the late king\u2019s former name), a keeper of the Tampal\u00e1 (*Amaranthus paniculatus*) plantation. He was a comely youth\u2014about the only good quality in him. In spite of some opposition Pilima Talawwa succeeded in his object, and the lucky young man was crowned king under the title of \u201cSri Wikrama R\u00e1ja Sipha.\u201d But Pilima Talawwa\u2019s days were numbered. He had numerous interviews with the Earl of Guilford (Governor North), which had for their object the usurpation of the throne and the exercising of supreme power over it; but he was baffled in the project which he so elaborately devised, and was beheaded in 1812 for an attempt to assassinate his regal nominee.\n\n\u2020 The king\u2019s relations went under this title. They lived at B\u00faw\u00e9lik\u00e1da and other suburbs of Kandy.\nEhalapola* and Molligo\u1e0da, Dis\u0101wa Pilima Talawwa, the Tamby Mudaliy\u00e1r and the Malay Muhandiram, the people of Yatinuwara and Udunuwara, Ekneligoda Mohott\u00e1la of Sabaragamuwa, Delwela Mohott\u00e1la, Mahawalatenne Mohott\u00e1la, and several other chiefs, with a large concourse of people, crossing over the river. The company consisted of such a great host that they were five days in crossing the ferry. Intelligence having been received that the king was at Medamahanuwara, we marched in that direction along with these reinforcements. On our way the Malay Muhandiram told us that it was a day\u2019s travelling from Teldeniya-Hanwella to Medamahanuwara. We were therefore obliged to encamp in the former village that night. There was a field covering a large area of ground. As the heat of the atmosphere was greatly enhanced by the large multitude that was gathered together, Ekneligoda Mohott\u00e1la and I walked out some way ahead at about 3 P.M. Ekneligoda was followed by about 500 of the Sabaragamuwa Kandyans, while Imbulanwale Arachchi and Yatipahuwe Kank\u00e1nama joined me. We had hardly gone a quarter of a mile when we were met by a lad, about ten or twelve years old, who was running across the field. He was pursued and was soon overtaken by a party of the Sabaragamuwa men, and when brought before us he cried out in great terror, doing us obeisance, \u201cO Lords, don\u2019t kill me; I will lead you to the hiding-place of the great god\u201d (meaning the king). The boy preceded us, Ekneligoda holding one end of a creeper which he tied round the lad\u2019s waist. We had not long to proceed, when the lad pointed out to us an enormous nuga tree, saying, \u201cThere, yonder tree is situated above the palace occupied by the great\n\n* Dorakumbure Dis\u0101wa, of M\u00e1tal\u00e9, tells me that Ehalapola Adig\u00e1r remained at the royal granary at Teldeniya, about half a mile from the scene of the king\u2019s capture, and sent his men up. In a despatch sent by Lieutenant-Governor Brownrigg to Earl Bathurst (dated February 25, 1815) he says that the king was captured by some armed Kandyans sent by Ehalapola Adig\u00e1r. This task the Adig\u00e1r (Ehalapola), he continues, undertook with alacrity and confidence, offering to proceed to Dumbara in person.\ngod.\u201d On approaching the place we saw a couple of Arachchige* women near the barricaded door. An Appuhamy of the royal bed chamber (a sentinel) was seen patrolling the compound, lance in hand. He asked: \u201cHalloa! Ekn\u0113ligoda, where are you going?\u201d and just as the latter replied, \u201cWe too have come here,\u201d the Appuhamy hurled his spear at Ekn\u0113ligoda, but luckily the weapon flew past him and struck heavily in the ground, where it was broken to several pieces, leaving Ekn\u0113ligoda unharmed. A party of Sabaragamuwa Kandyans then falling upon him seized violent hold of him, and bore him forcibly away; but what happened to him subsequently I am not aware of. Ekn\u0113ligoda, when he was brought to the door, demanded of the king to unbolt it. His majesty, however, taking no heed of the request, asked from behind the closed door, \u201cIs that you, Ekn\u0113ligoda, our kinsman?\u201d\u2020 \u201cYes, it is I,\u201d returned Ekn\u0113ligoda. While the king still kept the door unopened he was asked to throw out any offensive weapons that might be found inside. Three silver-mounted rifles and a couple of daggers were then thrown out through an opening. But the golden sword was not parted with as demanded. Some wooden mortars that were lying in the compound were afterwards taken hold of under Ekn\u0113ligoda\u2019s instructions, with which the men proceeded to batter down the door, which was quickly burst through. The Sabaragamuwa men forced their way into the house and created no little disturbance, divesting the queens of all their clothing and jewellery, and elbowing them out of the building clad with pieces of cloth about four cubits in girth (just enough to cover their nakedness). While the two poor queens were staggering about in their grief, and rolling here and there\n\n* Here the writer has fallen into an error. He ought to have said Alattige women, and not Arachechige. These women correspond to waiting maids, who customarily pronounced certain incantations prefatory to the king\u2019s movements.\n\n\u2020 This word does not convey the idea of any blood relationship. It was understood to mean whether Ekn\u0113ligoda was on the side of the king or espousing his cause.\nlike head-severed fowls, I posted myself with my two men silently outside the door, and said, \"Ammay\u00e1ru, ing\u00e1l\u00e9 w\u00e1ng\u00f3; payapudaw\u00e1ndam\" (Madams, don't be afraid, come here\"). The two queens came towards me, and fell upon my shoulders and cried out, \"O help us!\" In a few seconds I found my clothes stained with blood, and on turning round to see how it came about I found the queens had their ears torn, and the blood dropped from the wounds caused by the wrenching of the gems they had worn. During this awful commotion I got Imbulanwela Arachchi to fetch some medicinal leaves, and pounding them to a pulp applied it to staunch the bleeding. A little while after Ekn\u00e9ligoda Mohot\u1e6d\u00e1l\u00e1 forced the king out of the house* and behaved very insolently towards him, addressing him with such contemptuous phrases as, \"Come, fellow, let me take you to your father\" (meaning the English). Whereupon the king said, \"If you want to kill me, kill me, or do anything else you please, but I can't go on foot.\" While Ekn\u00e9ligoda was preparing to tie up the king, saying, \"Fetch kirindi creepers to tie up this fellow and take him like a hog,\" I addressed the Mohot\u1e6d\u00e1l\u00e1 and said, \"Nilame, you Kandyans have been up to this hour reverencing the king in such humiliating forms\u2020 as worshipping and prostrating yourselves before him, and calling him by such venerable appellations as O God, O Lord, O Father. But as we, from the time of our forefathers, have been the subjects of foreign powers, we do not owe any allegiance to his majesty.\n\n* This house where the king was found concealed was occupied by a Kandyan peasant named Udapi\u1e6diye Gammahe. It was situated at the village B\u00f3mura, between Urugala and Medamah\u00e1nuwara, in the district of Uda Dumbara, in the Central Province.\n\n\u2020 The king, says Robert Knox, was approached with the profoundest submission imaginable. When addressing his majesty the words Deiy\u00e1n Budduwenda, \"O lord, who art to attain Buddhahood,\" were used, and the speaker humiliated himself to such a contemptibly low form as that of a Balugetta (a puppy). The Kandyans seemed to think that the king was a supernatural god and brother of the sun and moon, and descended from the sun himself. When he passed by every mortal should be a hundred fathoms off his presence.\nHe is your God, your Lord, and your Father. Instead of conveying his majesty respectfully, it is not right on your part to show him such indignity as you are doing by this dishonourable treatment.\" Ekn\u0113ligoda Mohott\u0101la, retorting in a tone of great harshness, said, \"We have not come here to hearken to what you may say,\" and set about having the king tied with kirindi creepers. I then snatched off the shawl I had on my shoulders and asked him to bind up the king in it, and beheld the vexation and shame to which the king was basely subjected with inexpressible regret. Being unable to endure it any longer, I hit upon communicating the truth to Mr. D'Oyly, but was unable to put my hands into the pocket and take out a piece of paper and pencil, owing to the trouble I had about using my hands freely with the burden on them of the queen's body. I therefore got Ya\u1e6dipahuw\u00e9 Arachchi to take out my paper and pencil, and afterwards easing my hands a little asked him to stoop down, and having placed my paper on his back wrote as follows:\n\n\"The king (Kandyan) has fallen into our hands. Ekn\u0113ligoda Mohott\u0101la has bound the king and is carrying him along, almost dragging him, and subjecting him to great torment and contempt. Come you, therefore, at once with a number of palanquins. As the king and the queens are almost bare of any clothing, bring them also the wherewithal to be clad.\"\n\nHaving thus written I immediately despatched Ya\u1e6dipahuw\u00e9 Kank\u0101nama with the letter. Before the lapse of a Sinhalese p\u00e9ya Mr. D'Oyly sent Colonels Hardy and Hooke, a number of mounted officers, fifty orderlies, a hundred English cavalry, and six palanquins. In the meantime the Sabaragamuwa Kandyans dragged him along (as the king expressed an unwillingness to walk) and laid him prostrate on the side of a field. Then the British force and the two Colonels came to the place where we were located and whipped away and dismissed the offending Kandyans for ill-treating the king. The two Colonels then dismounted from their horses, took\noff their hats, and having made great obeisance by kneeling down before his majesty, untied the fetters and sought to console him, asking about his health and whether he felt thirsty or hungry. The king having told them that he was thirsty, the Colonels desired to know whether he would take any kind of tonic, to which the king replied, \"What drink is there for me now?\" Colonel Hardy then said that they had some brandy, wine, Madeira, port wine, claret, and beer, with wheaten bread and other eatables. These, he continued, are quite at the king's disposal. The king had only a draught of about half a bottle of Madeira wine mixed with water, and nothing else. The queens also drank claret wine and water.\n\nHaving clothed the king and the queens in white raiment, they were conducted to the palanquins. In the interval the king called me and said, \"Come here, my son, though the English might kill me, yet these queens will not be put to death. I place them under your protection.\" I then assured him that no danger could happen to his majesty. No sooner were the king and the queens lifted up in their palanquins than the two Colonels mounted their horses and posted themselves with drawn swords at the sides of the king's palanquins, while the other officers present in like manner attended on the other two palanquins. Fifty mounted orderlies with swords in hand placed themselves as rear and front guards, while a detachment of a hundred English soldiers, armed with loaded rifles at full cock, followed and preceded the cavalcade and conducted the king on his way with every mark of honour.\n\nThere were no Kandyans nor Malays in the company. Only a few low-country Sinhalese and militiamen were present. We reached General D'Oyly's camp about sunset with the king and the queens and the two Arachchige women. Sir John D'Oyly accorded a very respectful reception to the royal family, and comfortably lodged them for the time being in a tent furnished with bedding accommodation, and placed sentinels round. In a couple of days they were conducted to Kandy.\nA solemn Convention* was then held at the Audience Hall (now used as the District Court) in Kandy on March 2, 1815, between His Excellency Lieutenant-General Brownrigg, Governor of Ceylon, and the Adig\u00e1s, Dis\u00e1was, and other principal Chiefs. The result was a formal declaration of the king's deposition from the throne. Thus was put an end to the Sinhalese sway over Ceylon, which had lasted for 2,357 years.\n\nThe credit of capturing the king is mainly due to the untiring efforts of Ehalapola and the Sabaragamuwa Kandyans and the other Chiefs, among whom Ehalapola is the principal figure. Governor Brownrigg in his despatch says:\u2020 \"This is an enterprize which I have no hesitation in saying could not with any commonplace prudence have been entered upon, except with the most credible assurances of the concurring wishes of the Chiefs and people, nor could ever have been brought to a successful issue without their acquiescence and aid.\"\n\nThe captured king was then deported\u2021 to Vellore in Southern India, reaching North Beach on February 22, 1816. The Town Major, Captain Macdonald, and Mr. Marriott, were introduced to him as the gentlemen ordered by the Right Honourable the Governor to receive him. The king was lodged in the palace formerly occupied by Futteh Hyder, the eldest son of Tippoo Sultan.\u00a7 He there lived in great state with hosts of attendants, enjoying a rich Government stipend, and died on 30th January, 1832, of an abdominal disease. Coomarasamy Rajah, who recently visited Ceylon, is a grand-nephew of the deceased king.\n\n* See Ceylon Government Gazette Extraordinary, Official bulletin, March 6, 1815.\n\u2020 Dated February 25, 1815, and addressed to Earl Bathurst.\n\u2021 An interesting account of the king's deportation, by Mr. J. B. Siebel, appeared in the Orientalist.\n\u00a7 Based on a letter sent to the Chief Secretary to Government by Mr. Marriott, dated Vellore, March 17, 1816.\n4. Mr. Justice Lawrie remarked that he was sure the Members of the Society were indebted to the writer for his translation of an interesting account, by an alleged eye-witness, of a very interesting occurrence in the history of Ceylon. But the writer had not told them\u2014and possibly he had not the means of ascertaining\u2014who the Mr. Dias was who contributed the Paper to the Sinhalese Magazine in 1861. The Paper appeared forty-five years after the events which it purported to describe.\n\nMr. Lawrie then read the following letter from Mr. D'Oyly written to the Governor immediately after the capture of the king:\n\nKing's Granary,\nTeldeniya, February, 17, 1815.\n\nDear Sir,\u2014I have the sincerest joy in reporting to Your Excellency that the object of your anxious wishes is accomplished. The King of Kandy is a captive in our hands. He was surrounded yesterday by the people of Dumbara in conjunction with some armed Kandyans sent by the Adigar, in the precincts of Medamah\u0101nuwara, and taken about an hour before dusk in the house of Udupitiya \u00c1rachchi at Gallehewake, a mile beyond Medamah\u0101nuwara, with two of his queens. A few attendants, after the house was surrounded, made a show of resistance, and wounded two or three men, but fled after a few shots from the assailants. I went forward with palanquins to meet him at Rambukwela, and conducted him to this place with his queens, from whence, after rest and refreshments, they will be sent to Kandy under a sufficient military guard. The king's mother and two more of his queens are at Hanwella, and a detachment will be sent immediately to conduct them in safety and to secure from plunder any treasure and valuables which may be found.\n\nI have written also to be sent to the King's relations and Nayakars informing them of these events, and inviting them to come without fear.\n\nI have, &c.,\n\nJohn D'Oyly.\n\nMr. C. M. Fernando inquired of Mr. Justice Lawrie if there is any historical foundation for the tradition that Jayawardena Mudaliy\u00e1r, popularly known as Tamby Mudaliy\u00e1r, was instrumental in the capture of the Kandyan King.\n\nMr. Lawrie replied in the negative and stated that the credit of the capture rested entirely with Ehalapola and his men. Mr. Lawrie gave a summary of the contents of the despatch which Governor Brownrigg had addressed on the subject of the capture of the King to Earl Balthurst, then Secretary of State for the Colonies.\n\nDr. Vandort said he was sorry to say he could not attach much faith to the Paper read; and the doubts which existed in his mind had been more than confirmed by the careful and judicious observations of Mr. Justice Lawrie. He was strongly inclined to think that the original of the Paper read was a compilation of traditional records,\nsupplemented to a great extent by the writer's own imagination. As regards both dates and facts, the Paper could be shown to be more than inaccurate\u2014to be positively untrue. He did not know whether Members of the Society were acquainted with a book by Captain De Bushe, one of the leaders of the British forces who headed the detachment from Negombo, entitled \"Letters from Ceylon\"\u2014letters dealing with the part he played in the expedition. In that book it would be seen that the figures as to the number of troops from the various parts of the Island which marched into Kandy were widely different from those given by the writer of the Paper. Nor did the names of the officers correspond. These inaccuracies threw considerable doubt on the authenticity of the account.\n\nMr. Wace also spoke on the subject, being invited to state whether he had heard anything from the descendants in Sabaragamuwa of the Chief Ekneligoda, who, the supposed eye-witness alleged, had ill-treated the Kandyan King at the time of his capture. Mr. Wace said he had not heard anything of the sort; nor that any great ill-feeling existed between the chief and the king. Considering the length of time which had elapsed between the events recorded and the publication of them in 1861, it was not at all likely that they could be correct.\n\nMr. Harward said that he thought they would be wrong in totally discrediting the Paper. It was full of inaccuracies and numerical exaggerations; but it contained undesigned coincidences which looked as if it really was written by an eye-witness. It was probably the work of a man who was present at the events described, but whose memory had become confused during the intervening years.\n\n5. The reading of Mr. F. H. Modder's Paper on \"Ridi Vih\u00e1r\u00e9,\" of which notice had been given, was postponed owing to the lateness of the hour.\n\n6. A vote of thanks was accorded to the writers of the Papers read, on a motion proposed by Mr. Staniforth Green and seconded by Mr. C. M. Fernando.\n\n7. The Meeting concluded with a vote of thanks to the Chair, proposed by Mr. Justice Lawrie.\nGENERAL MEETING.\n\nColombo Museum, June 11, 1896.\n\nPresent:\n\nThe Lord Bishop of Colombo, President, in the Chair.\nHon.

Mr. Harward read the following Paper:\u2014\nANCIENT CITIES AND TEMPLES IN THE KURUNEGALA DISTRICT.\n\nBy F. H. Modder.\n\nII.\u2014RIDI VIH\u00c1R\u00c9.\n\nAt Rid\u00ed-gam\u00e1,* 11\u00b706 miles from Kurun\u00e9gala (that is, 2\u00b725 miles along the road to Kandy, turn at Mallawan-pi\u1e6diya to left, 7\u00b781 miles along the minor road to M\u00e1tal\u00e9, turn to right at Rambukkan-deniya, thence a mile to the south-east) stands Rid\u00ed Vih\u00e1r\u00e9\u2014the most celebrated temple, not only in the Kurun\u00e9gala District, but in the whole of the North-Western Province. The greater part of the approach thither from Rambukkan-deniya lies through a delightful shady avenue, the path increasing as you advance till a dilapidated building is reached. On the left rises a high wall, which hides the temple premises from view, and entrance into the temple yard is obtained through a wooden doorway in the wall. The temple is called Rajata-lena (Sin. Rid\u00ed-lena) in the P\u00e1li works. The ancient name of the place was Ambatthakolalena.\u2020 It is referred to as Rajata-vih\u00e1r\u00e9 in the Mah\u00e1wans\u00e1, as having been built by King Du\u1e6dugemunu (164\u2013140 B.C.),\u2021 and the tradition current in the place supports this statement.\n\nThe following legend explains the origin of the name. When Du\u1e6dugemunu reigned at Anur\u00e1dhapura (164\u2013140 B.C.) a man by the name of Weparaya (Vy\u00e1p\u00e1ra, \"petty trader\"), who went about selling curry stuffs, came to the spot\n\n* Rid\u00ed-gama (\"silver village\") evidently derives its name from the temple Rid\u00ed Vih\u00e1r\u00e9, or \"silver temple.\"\n\n\u2020 M\u00fcller found \"several fragments of inscriptions on the flat rock near to an old d\u00e1gaba, but only one is well enough preserved\u2014that at least a part of it can be made out. It begins Siddhisaddhamakesiri..........After this comes most probably the name of the king, which is not quite legible on the stone, and in the second line I believe I have deciphered a part of the ancient name of the place, Abattha [kolalena].\" Ancient Inscriptions, p. 39.\n\n\u2021 Chap. C., 239. In a note to chap. XXXV. of the Mah\u00e1wans\u00e1 it is stated that \u00c1manda G\u00e1mani Abhaya built the Rajata-lena.\nwhere the cave stands, and saw there the branch of a jak tree on the ground with a large ripe fruit. Finding it to be a sweet jak fruit of an extraordinary size, and unwilling to partake of it without giving a portion to the priesthood, he sounded the k\u00e1laghosa (the call of refection), when three Rahats (Buddhist saints) instantly arrived on the spot through the air. After having served out portions of the fruit to the Rahats, he partook of the rest. One of the Rahats suddenly disappearing, he went in search of him and found him seated in the adjoining cave, engaged in abstract meditation. He discovered near the spot where the Rahat sat a column of silver springing up from the ground, and reported the circumstance to the king, who repaired thither and removed the silver column, and built a vih\u00e1r\u00e9 on the spot where the Rahats partook of the jak fruit, which received the name of Warak\u00e1-velandu-vih\u00e1r\u00e9, \"the vih\u00e1r\u00e9 in which jak fruit was partaken of.\"*\n\nA small building of stone, but of no architectural pretensions, is still pointed out as the identical temple above alluded to.\n\nAnother legend is to the effect that when Du\u1e6dugemunu was building the Mah\u00e1 Th\u00fapa at Anur\u00e1dhapura, he was short of funds to pay his hired labourers, and the workmen clamouring for payment, he fled into the jungle, and wandering about reached the cave, where he saw a column of silver miraculously springing up from under the ground. He chopped off pieces of silver with his sword, until he got enough to pay the labourers, when the silver column disappeared.*\n\nAccording to the Mah\u00e1wa\u1e47sa,\u2020 the vih\u00e1r\u00e9 seems to have long been in a state of decay, and King K\u00edrti \u015ar\u00ed (1747 A.D.), in order that it might be repaired, furnished the necessary materials, artificers, painters, and much refined gold for gilding the statue of Buddha, and gave over charge of the temple to the novice Siddhattha, who accordingly commenced the\n\n* Reports on the Inspection of Temple Libraries, by Louis de Zoyza, Mah\u00e1 Mudaliy\u00e1r (Sessional Paper XI. of 1875).\n\u2020 Mah\u00e1wa\u1e47sa, C., 239, ff.\nrepairs and improvements. The name of \"Siddhattha\" has since been adopted by the priests who officiate here.\n\nHe [Siddhattha] removed everything that was old and decayed in the vih\u00e1r\u00e9, and made the thick and high wall thereof of solid stone to shine, and the floor and the outer wall also. And he caused a picture of the Supreme Buddha, as he was engaged in the battle with M\u00e1ra, to be painted on the roof of the rock, and divers flowers and creepers also.\n\nAll this is yet to be seen in the interior of the \"Mah\u00e1-vih\u00e1r\u00e9,\" as the larger edifice is designated in contradistinction to the smaller temple, which is called \"Uda-vih\u00e1r\u00e9,\" and is situated on a rock of higher elevation.\n\nHe caused also the great sleeping image to be made with fine brick and mortar and clay, and many other images of Buddha also, sitting and upright. And in the inner wall he caused about a thousand beautiful pictures of the Supreme Buddha to be painted with exquisite art. At the foot of the great sleeping image he caused to be made in due order beautiful images of Ananda, the constant attendant of Buddha and the preserver of the Law, of Metteyya Bodhisatta, of the excellent N\u00e1tha Deva, and of the King Du\u1e6d\u1e6dhag\u00e1ma\u1e47i.\n\nThe sleeping image, which is 12 cubits in length, occupies nearly the entire length of the left wing of the interior. In addition to the images of Maitr\u00ed Bodhisatva, Mah\u00e1 Vish\u1e47u, Mah\u00e1 Kassapa, and King Du\u1e6d\u1e6dugemunu, there is a figure of Tibbo\u1e6duw\u00e1we Mah\u00e1 N\u00e1yaka Unn\u00e1ns\u00e9, one of the earliest incumbents,* at the foot of the great image. In front of the platform on which the sleeping image lies are set two rows of glazed tiles, with various pictorial representations on them. These tiles, it is said, were the gift of the King of Siam to King K\u00edrti \u015ar\u012b.\n\nIn the right wing of the temple there are ten images of Buddha in a standing posture, a large figure of Buddha in a sitting, and another in a standing attitude about 8 ft. in height.\n\nIn the centre of the building stands a gilt figure of Buddha, which it is said was modelled after the grateful\n\n* The head of this monastery has, from its foundation, been a member of the Tibbo\u1e6duw\u00e1we family. This is the most important of the numerous private livings in Ceylon. When one of these becomes vacant before one of the family to which it belongs has been ordained here, as in England, a temporary incumbent is put in, who generally serves as tutor to the young heir (Administration Reports, North-Western Province, 1870, p. 285).\nDu\u1e6dugemunu, and marks the site whence the view of silver sprung up. In front of this image there is an oblong wooden table for offerings.\n\nTwo Chinese lamps, which are suspended from the roof, are said to be gifts of a penitent Buddhist after his return from penal servitude at Malacca, whither he was transported!\n\nAnd he [Siddhattha] gilded with gold the five large images of Buddha and completed the other works that had to be done inside. On the outside wall also he caused to be painted a beautiful row of figures of Devas and Brahmas carrying flowers in their hands, as if they had come to worship. He caused also to be made a large arch, beautiful and pleasant to the sight, and two figures of lions on the two sides of the door, and figures of demons on the spaces between in the walls.\n\nNearly all this is in a wonderful state of preservation; and in addition thereto are at each of the two entrances to the interior of the temple a pair of tusk-holders, one on each side, on which magnificent elephant tusks are fixed on festival days.\n\nHe also had pictures made of the sixteen principal shrines consisting of Mahiyangana and the rest, and a likeness of the excellent foot-print [of Buddha] on the Sacca-baddha-pabbata [a mountain in Siam], and many scenes also painted with exquisite art from many J\u0101takas, showing the ten-fold P\u0101rami, the three-fold Cariy\u0101, the five great self-denying sacrifices and other virtues (of the Bodhisatta). And in the hall he caused many pictures to be painted: lions, elephants, and swans, in rows; likewise flowers and creepers also.\n\nTo the right of the Mah\u00e1-vih\u00e1r\u00e9 is a small budu-g\u00e9, the framework of the door leading into which is of exquisite workmanship, elaborately inlaid with carved ivory, and said to be a present from King K\u00edrti \u015ar\u012b.\n\nThe following description refers to the \"U\u1e0da-vih\u00e1r\u00e9,\" and applies with equal fidelity to the interior and other buildings as they exist at the present day, the painting being as fresh as new:\n\nThen in the beautiful cave that is on the top of the self-same rock he made a fine, large, and excellent image-house pleasant to the sight, and many works in stone that were wrought to perfection. In it he made a large, beautiful, and life-like sitting image of Buddha, pleasant to behold, and on both sides thereof two fine upright statues. He also caused to be made there the images of Metteyya Bodhisatta and of Uppalavanna and many images of Buddha, and hundreds also of arhats. Likewise there were figures of the twenty-four Buddhas\n(before Gautama), many Bodhi trees, the (events of the) twenty and four predictions, pictures of the sixteen principal shrines and of demons and of other evil spirits, of the five different venerable convocations, and divers other paintings of exquisite beauty. In that very place he placed relics of Buddha and built thereon a cetiya and adorned it with a pinnacle of gold. And on the top of the image-house in that excellent rock basin he caused a delightful picture to be made of the Sage, seated amidst his five hundred disciples, with S\u0101riputta at their head. And even in the different courts (of the vih\u0101r\u00e9) he built walls and open halls and divers gates also, and rows of steps and other excellent works. He repaired many old walls and also built many new ones; and completed all in a beautiful manner.\n\nThe ceremony of setting the eyes of the images was performed under a lucky star and at a favourable hour, the place having been adorned with many continuous rows of arches, the king sending his ministers with apparel and ornaments to conduct the feast.\n\nThe following has reference to the structure hereinbefore mentioned, which is the first to attract the attention of the visitor on his entering the temple yard, and which is popularly identified as Warak\u00e1-velandu-vih\u0101r\u00e9:\n\nAnd on the courtyard without an open hall is built on stone pillars, with seats prepared (for priests). And the great body of people assembled themselves together there, and were instructed in the rules of moral conduct, such as the five precepts and others; and they had everyone the opportunity daily of hearing much of the law expounded to them. Moreover, he [the priest Siddhattha] in his great loving-kindness did often invite preachers of religion, and make them to discourse to the people all through the three watches of the night.\n\nThe following refers to the temple generally:\n\nAnd he [the king or priest] caused that vih\u0101r\u00e9 named Rajata to be completed, and that great feast to be held in the 2,301 of the Parinibb\u00e1na of the Supreme Buddha.\n\nAnd on the south side of this vih\u0101r\u00e9 there was a beautiful cetiya that was built (in former times) on a beautiful broad and flat rock; but it had gone wholly to ruin, leaving only a mound of earth. And for the purpose of restoring it he collected lime and bricks and stones and other materials from divers places. And he built a beautiful square foundation, wherein he placed a relic of the glorious Sage. And, while the cetiya was yet building, he invited priests and caused a consecrated boundary to be set upon a beautiful plot of land in the neighbourhood thereof, and built thereon an Up\u00f3satha house and a \u00c1rama for priests, with tiled roofs and the like. And he made the\ngrounds around it into a large park, containing many ponds, and adorned them with divers trees and creeping trees that bear flowers, and trees that bear fruit and the like. And in this monastery he caused the sons of Buddha to take up their abode, and earnestly exhorted them to conform their behaviour to the doctrines and precepts of religion. And this place, which was restored by the authority of the king, was the resort of great saints, and was had in great honour by the ancient rulers of Lagk\u00e1. An when the great king had heard thereof, he ordained that the boundary of the vih\u00e1r\u00e9 should be the same as had already been defined (by the priest); and he offered the land thereto, and increased all the ceremonial offerings and alms to the priesthood in this vih\u00e1r\u00e9 and thus gained a store of merit.\n\nAnd the king, who was endued with faith and other virtues, worshipped at the Rajata-vih\u00e1r\u00e9 also and acquired much merit.\n\nHaving long heard of the fame of the temple library, the late Mah\u00e1 Mudaliy\u00e1r L. de Zoyza paid a visit thither, with a view to report thereon, and was greatly disappointed with the small number of manuscripts found there, among which, however, he came across some rare ones.\n\nThe books are contained in a wooden box, curiously painted and set with what appears to be precious stones. There are three Pi\u1e6dakas and their ancient Atthakath\u00e1s, or commentaries. These works are superbly got up. The boards are composed of plates of ivory exquisitely carved, and either set with precious stones or ornamented with flowers of gold.\n\nAmong other curious objects is a gold p\u00e1tra, or begging bowl, some short manuscripts executed on silver plates, and a manuscript on ola written in the smallest Sinhalese characters possible. The box, the ornamented books, and the gold vessel were, it is said, the gifts of King K\u00edrti \u015ar\u00ed.\n\nDeposited in this box are also copies of Childers\u2019 P\u00e1li Dictionary (presented by the Ceylon Government) and M\u00fcller\u2019s Ancient Inscriptions of Ceylon.\n\nThe incumbent, if in good humour, exhibits to the visitor, with pardonable pride, a gaudily worked cushion, the cover of which consists of pieces of variegated cloth stitched together. This wonderful cushion, it is alleged, was used by King Du\u1e6dugemunu and his successors to recline on when they came to the temple to pray.\nThe following is a list of the villages registered under the Service Tenures Commission, as subject to services to the Rid\u00ed Vih\u00e1r\u00e9, and gives an idea of the temple endowments:\n\n| Village          | Number of Paravani Pangu. | Extent of | Amount for which Service may be Commuted |\n|------------------|---------------------------|-----------|------------------------------------------|\n|                  |                           | Fields.*  | Gardens.* | Hen.* | Rs. c. |\n| Amb\u00e1goda        | 1                         | 5 0 0     | 1 0 2    | 2 0 9 | 34 85 |\n| Eganvela         | 1                         | 0 6 0     | \u2014        | 3 0 6 | 41 50 |\n| Hiriket\u00e9         | 13                        | 13 1 6    | 6 0 0    | 15 2 7 | 96 90 |\n| Illupp\u00e9lessa     | 9                         | 12 0 7    | 4 3 8    | 15 1 5 | 81 30 |\n| Karawmada        | 2                         | 5 2 0     | 2 0 0    | 1 0 0 | 54 75 |\n| Kumburumulla     | 2                         | 11 2 0    | 0 0 2    | 4 3 0 | 83 80 |\n| Mandity\u00e1wa       | 9                         | 10 0 0    | 2 2 5    | 13 3 4 | 74 60 |\n| Maratiha         | 36                        | 81 2 9    | 26 1 5\u00bd | 62 0 5\u00be | 576 85 |\n| N\u00e1biritta        | 7                         | 10 2 6\u00bd   | 3 0 7    | 14 0 1 | 177 15 |\n| Nilantattuwa     | 2                         | 17 0 0    | 2 1 0    | 31 1 7 | 117 70 |\n| Rambukkandana\u2020   | 10                        | 20 0 1    | 13 1 1   | 34 1 5 | 142 85 |\n| Ridigama\u2021        | 37                        | 50 3 2    | 13 0 3\u00bc | 65 3 1 | 376 55 |\n| Ur\u00fal\u00e9potta       | 2                         | 7 1 5     | 0 1 5    | 6 1 0 | 56 45 |\n| Warak\u00e1-vehera     | 3                         | 14 3 2    | 4 3 6    | 34 2 5 | 106 85 |\n| Wewagedara       | 1                         | 4 2 1     | 0 3 8    | 5 0 1 | 34 85 |\n\nTotal ... 135 265 3 9\u00bd 81 0 23 299 2 6\u00be 1,956 95\n\n* The acreage is given in amunams, p\u00e9las, and kurunies. Ten kurunies make 1 p\u00e9la, and 4 p\u00e9las 1 amunam. In English measurement an amunam of paddy land = 2 acres, of high land = 40 acres.\n\n\u2020 The case of the tenants of this village is cited by the Commissioner as a remarkable case of religious toleration which has become known in the course of the Service Tenures inquiry. The tenants are all Mohammedans. \"The service which they render to that establishment (Rid\u00ed Vih\u00e1r\u00e9) is confined to the payment of dues and the transport of produce, &c., and has no connection with the services of the Buddhist vih\u00e1r\u00e9, and their own lebbe or priest is supported by a farm set apart by the Buddhist landlords for the purpose. There are thus Mohammedan tenants performing without reluctance service to a Buddhist monastery freely supporting a priest for its Mohammedan tenants.\" (Administration Reports, North-Western Province, 1870, p. 285.)\n\n\u2021 A block 108 acres of planted land in this village belonging to the temple was leased to the late Mr. R. J. Corbet for ninety-nine years, and a smaller extent of chena land for planting to Mr. P. Braine. If the provisions of the Buddhist Temporalities Ordinance were not allowed to be a dead letter, as they unfortunately are in this district, they would doubtless operate as an effectual bar to these questionable demises for indefinite periods by unscrupulous incumbents, much to the prejudice of the temple revenues.\n\n3. The following Paper was next read:\u2014\nTHE INAUGURATION OF THE KING IN ANCIENT CEYLON.\n\nBy C. M. FERNANDO, B.A., LL.B. Cantab., M.R.A.S. England.\n\nThe word \"abhiseka\" literally meant \"sprinkling,\" and as the sprinkling of the sacred water of the Ganges formed the chief feature of the ancient ceremony of the royal inauguration, the ceremony itself was called abhiseka. The present description of it is contained in the P\u00e1li commentary of the Mah\u00e1wansa, known as the Mah\u00e1wansa Tik\u00e1, to which it has been embodied from an ancient Buddhistical work. Apart from its inherent interest, it affords an instructive glimpse into the constitution of ancient society in La\u1e45k\u00e1.\n\nThe original P\u00e1li text is as follows:\u2014\n\nMajjhimasangitiy\u00e1 cullasihan\u00e1dasuttavan\u00f1an\u00e1ya s\u00edhalatthakath\u00e1ya vuttam, katham?

Do thou rule over the land in uprightness, and imbued with the ten royal virtues.\u2021 Have thou for the Kshatriya race a heart filled with paternal love and solicitude. Let them (in return) protect, and guard, and cherish thee.\"\n\nNext, the royal chaplain.\u00a7 splendidly attired in a manner befitting his office, taking in both his hands a silver chank filled with Ganges water, and raising it aloft, pours the abhis\u0113ka water over his head, and says as follows:\n\n* I.e., he must be over sixteen years of age.\n\u2020 Fig tree (Ficus glomerata).\n\u2021 They are d\u0101nam, almsgiving; silam, observance of the precepts; paric\u0113ga, generosity; akkodha, freedom from wrath; avihims\u0101, mercy; khanti, forbearance; ajjavam, rectitude; maddavam, mildness; tapa, self-mortification; avirodhana, freedom from enmity.\n\u00a7 Purohita, a Brahmin, who is the king's domestic chaplain.\n\"Sire, by this ceremony of abhiseka all the people of the Brahmin race make thee their Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja for their protection. Do thou rule over the land in uprightness, and imbued with the ten royal virtues. Have thou for the Brahmin race a heart filled with paternal love and solicitude. Let them (in return) protect, and guard, and cherish thee.\"\n\nNext, he who holds the office of Setthi,* attired in a suitable manner, taking in both his hands a golden chank filled with Ganges water, and raising it aloft, pours the abhiseka water over his head, and says as follows:\u2014\n\n\"Sire, by this ceremony of abhis\u00e9ka all the Grahapati,\u2020 for their protection, make thee their Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja. Do thou rule over the land in uprightness and imbued with the ten royal virtues. Have thou for the Grahapati a heart filled with paternal love and solicitude. Let them (in return) protect, and guard, and cherish thee.\"\n\nThose who address the above form of words pronounce, as it were, a curse upon the king, as if they should say:\u2014\n\n\"It is meet that thou shouldst rule the land in accordance with these our words. Should it not be so, mayest thy head split in seven pieces.\"\n\nIn this Island of Lagk\u00e1 be it known that a Kshatriya princess, sent by Dhamm\u00e1soka, performed the ceremony of abhiseka over the head of Dev\u00e1nampiyatissa\u2021 with a right-handed sea-chank filled with water from lake Anotatta.\u00a7 Previous to this no such ceremony was known (in Lagk\u00e1).\n\nIt would thus appear that the king in these ancient times was regarded less in the light of a ruling despot than in that of the chief representative and leader of the people. Himself a Kshatriya, he was the leader of that noble race. To him was committed the care of the priestly Brahmins, and to him was entrusted the welfare of the rest of his subjects. As regards the latter, the fact that their spokesman was the most influential of the Grahapati confirms the theory propounded by Sir Henry Maine and others, and shows that ancient Ceylon formed no exception to the rule that in all archaic society the unit of the state was the family, not the individual.\n\nIt would also appear from the above extract that the introduction of the abhiseka ceremony into Ceylon was\n\n* Setthi, a wealthy merchant, the treasurer.\n\u2020 Gahapati, head of a household, pater familias.\n\u2021 Circa 305 B.C.\n\u00a7 Name of one of the seven great lakes of the Ganges.\ncotemporaneous with the adoption of Buddhism as her state religion. But there is no reason to suppose that the ceremony was of purely Buddhistic origin. A new religion seldom adopts an entirely fresh ritual.* It rather adapts and assimilates an existing ritual so as to suit the new circumstances, and in the abhiseka ceremony one sees but a revised edition of the Vedantic ceremony of the royal inauguration.\n\nFrom what can be gathered from the Vedantic literature, the Hind\u00fa ceremony of the royal inauguration was but the parent of the Buddhistic ceremony.\n\nHere is an extract (Aitareya Brahmana, VIII., 6\u20139):\n\nHe (the priest) spreads the tiger skin on the throne in such a manner that the hairs come outside, and that part which covered the neck is turned eastward. For the tiger is the Kahattra (royal power) of the beasts in the forests ......... The king, when taking his seat on the throne, approaches it from behind, turning his face eastwards, kneels down with crossed legs, so that his right knee touches the earth, and holding the throne with his hands prays over it an appropriate mantra.\n\nThe priest then pours the holy water over the king's head, and repeats the following:\u2014\"With these waters, which are happy, which cure everything, increase the royal power, the immortal Praj\u00e1pati sprinkled Indra, Soma sprinkled the royal Varuna, and Yama sprinkled Manu, with the same I sprinkle thee. Be the ruler over kings in this world,\" &c.\n\nAt the conclusion of the ceremony the king partakes of a drink of wine made out of soma juice, which the priest hands to him.\n\nBuddhism, with its hatred of the slaughter of animals and of the use of wine, has eliminated the tiger skin and the soma juice, while it has retained the pouring of the sacred water. In both instances was the newly inaugurated king exhorted to do his duty by his subjects. \"If thou shalt be a ruler, then from this day judge the strong and the weak with equal justice, resolve on doing good incessantly to the public, and protect the country from all calamities.\" (White, Yajur-veda, X. 27.)\n\n* One chief feature of Buddhism, as of Hind\u00faism, is its receptivity. (Monier Williams, Buddhism.)\nMr. Harward, at the conclusion of the Paper, asked whether Mr. Fernando could tell the audience whether there was any evidence as to how recently the custom existed in Ceylon.\n\nMr. Fernando replied that the earliest authentic mention of the ceremony was the one he had just dealt with. He was aware that in one of the Government publications there was mention made of the fact that King Wijayo went through the ceremony of inauguration. That would take the ceremony back to nearly 600 B.C., but he thought this was merely a guess on the part of the compiler of the \"reader,\" and not an historical fact. He found that, in later times, after the ceremony was inaugurated, and became a part of Buddhism, it was continued by almost every king, and he had not the slightest doubt that, as the history of Ceylon grew, the ceremony also went through several changes; but he could not find in the Mahavamsa anything more than a mention of the abhiseka ceremony. There was nothing descriptive of the ceremony. He believed Mr. Justice Lawrie could mention some facts about the ceremony in a more recent period, and he had no doubt that in later times the ceremony took a different shape because of the changes which the original primitive Buddhism underwent at the hands of the Tamil invaders and others, who introduced many things which Buddhism never professed to admit.\n\nMr. Justice Lawrie said he had not had the time to go into the subject as thoroughly as he would have wished with regard to the inaugural ceremony; but he believed there was still a stone in Kandy on which the later kings of Kandy sat in public, and were there girded with the sword of kingship. That was the open or ostensible ceremony of coronation or inauguration, and immediately after the king was girt with the sword, the title which he intended to take and be known by was publicly proclaimed. He did not know whether there was any actual coronation, in the strict sense of the word, but the later kings of Kandy were certainly spoken of and portrayed as wearing a crown. The stone he had alluded to was opposite the Old Palace. With regard to the ceremony being considered a Buddhist one by some, he was of opinion that there was no trace whatever to show that it was in any way a religious rite or anything suggesting the presence of Buddhist priests at the ceremony. He did not know whether he was right, but it seemed to him there was nothing in the Paper read which suggested that the ceremony was a Buddhist one at all.\n\nThe Rev. F. H. de Winton, referring to the word grahapati, which occurred in the course of the Paper, questioned whether it could not be considered identical with the Buddhist expression \"householder.\" If so, it might confirm the view that the system dividing the people into three sections originated, or was introduced, about the same time as the introduction of Buddhism into Ceylon.\n\nMr. Coomaraswamy said that the abhiseka, which was a bath or sprinkling, was not considered to be the most important part of the inauguration ceremony by Hind\u00fas. There was a ceremony prior to the abhiseka; then the abhiseka itself; and thirdly, the putting on of the crown, which completed the ceremony. As regards the right-handed sea-chank referred to as rare, they were not very rare,\nand were used in all important matters, especially in religious rites. According to Hind\u00fa ideas, the left-handed chank was not as useful as the right-handed one, but the latter was not so rare as was supposed. Even now right-handed chanks could be bought in Calcutta for about Rs. 200 or Rs. 250 each.\n\nMr. Fernando, replying to Mr. Lawrie, said that the description read that evening was of the ceremony of the inauguration of King Dev\u00e1nampiyatissa, in whose reign Buddhism was introduced to Ceylon by Mahinda. Dhamm\u00e1soka, who is said to have sent the Kshatria maiden and the chanks for the inauguration, was the father of Mahinda; he was the great Asoka under whom Buddhism in India received so great an impetus. There could thus be no doubt that the ceremony was adapted to Buddhism from Hind\u00faism. It was the Buddhistic child of a Hind\u00faistic parent. Replying to Mr. de Winton, he said he had interpreted grahapati as pater familias, or head of a household, as pati and pater were of the same root.\n\nThe Chairman pointed out that it was not so. \"Pati\" was derived, not from the same root as pater, but from the same root as the Latin potis and potens. It had nothing to do with the word \"father,\" but implied having \"power over\" the house. Referring to a remark of Mr. Fernando that the best authority on the subject was the Mah\u00e1vanssa, his Lordship said that, excellent as was the Mah\u00e1vanssa, and great as was its veracity, the writers of it could not possibly have known what took place 700 years before their time, and it was as impossible for those now living to say that the statements in the Mah\u00e1vanssa were true as that they were false.\n\nMr. D. W. Ferguson proposed, and Mr. Coom\u00e1rasw\u00e1my seconded, a vote of thanks to the authors of the Papers. This was carried unanimously, and the proceedings terminated with a vote of thanks to the Chairman, proposed by Mr. J. H. Renton and seconded by Mr. Harward, the former remarking that they were all grateful to His Lordship for finding the time to come there, in spite of the extra heavy duties which devolved upon him at the present time.\nCOUNCIL MEETING.\n\nColombo Museum, July 16, 1896.\n\nPresent:\n\nThe Lord Bishop of Colombo, President, in the Chair.\nMr. C.

MODDER.\n\nIII.\u2014PANDUWAS NUWARA.\n\nThe founding of the City.\n\nHidden away in a secluded part of the district, about a mile and a half to the south-east of the modern village Hettipola, on the Wariyapola-Chilaw minor road, distant about twenty miles from Kurunegala, lie the ruins of this ancient city. Its antiquity is beyond all question; but its identity with Upatissa Nuwara, or that it was founded by the king after whom it is said to be called, is open to doubt.\n\nThe following extract from a Sinhalese history of Ceylon* supports the tradition that Upatissa Nuwara was built by the regent after whom it was first designated, and that the name changed into Panduwas Nuwara on the accession of King Panduwas Deva to the throne:\n\nPanduwas Nuwara is said to be the oldest city founded in Ceylon except Tammana Nuwara, which was founded by Wijayo, the first king of Ceylon. The city Panduwas Nuwara was originally founded by Upatissa, Prime Minister of Wijayo (505 B.C.), and was called after him.\u2020 He reigned in it only for one year as sub-king and gave it up to Panduwas, the nephew of Wijayo, on his landing in Ceylon,\n\n* Furnished by the late Samuel Jayatilaka, Mudaliyar, to the Hon. F. R. Saunders, C.M.G., when Government Agent of the North-Western Province, and included in the correspondence with Sir W. H. Gregory, Governor, more particularly referred to below.\n\n\u2020 Upatissa Nuwara. President Marambe of the Village Tribunals of the Dewamedi hatpattu, who has been at some pains in collecting material on this point, feels convinced that Upatissa Nuwara and Panduwas Nuwara are one and the same city. He quotes from the Narenda-charitawa lokana-pradipikawa that the former was built on the banks of the Dedururoya, and from the Mahawansa that it was built on the Kadamba river, and points out that Kadamba in Pali is equivalent to Kolom in Sinhalese.\nhe himself moving to Tissawa, which is not far from Panduwas Nuwara. The city was after the assumption of its government by Panduwas called after him, and to this day it is known as such. He reigned thirty years, improving and embellishing it. His son Abhayo succeeded him at his death (474 B.C.). Abhayo reigned twenty years most religiously and with every virtue, until he was interrupted by the civil wars then raging between his brothers and his nephew Pandukabhayo, and which lasted for fourteen years, when he threw up the government and retired to Parama-kanda in the Demala-pattu, which is by tradition known as the place where he ended his days leading a religious life. After the cessation of the civil wars Pandukabhayo, having obtained victory over his uncles, established himself in his father-in-law's city, Anuradhapura. In the interval Tisso, the brother of Abhayo and uncle of Pandukabhayo, held the kingdom of Panduwas.\n\nThe following from the Kadaim-pota assigns the founding of the city to King Panduwas, and supplies interesting particulars in connection therewith:\n\nKing Panduwas, son of Somithera, the brother of King Wijaya, having arrived in Ceylon in his sixteenth year, on a Friday, under the asterism Pusanekata, ordered his ministers to found a city after his name. He sent for his ministers, who lived at the time in Hastipura, and said: \"All of you make me a city here.\" They began accordingly to build the city four and a half gav to the west of Hastipura.* Seeing this, King Sakraya ordered the god Wiswakarma, the wonderful maker, to beautify the city. Thereupon Wiswakarma came and stood there, and having surveyed the length and breadth of the city ordered the (cubic) rule to be struck on the ground, when the following rose into existence:\n\n- 600 palaces (wahala geval).\n- 300 smaller buildings (outhouses?) (kulu geval).\n- 9 buildings containing lion thrones (sinhasana geval).\n\nand that the city stood on the Kolamunu-oya, a tributary of the Deduru-oya. He cites in further support of his contention a royal grant in the Vittipota of the village Moragolla to one Appuhami, in which it is stated that Upatissa Nuwara adjoins Moragolla, and similarly from the Kadaim-pota of a royal grant of the village Moragama to one Punchappuhami, in which the said village is described as adjoining the city in question. Upatissa Nuwara, says President Marambe, was also known as Ela Hatarana Nuwara (the city of four moats), Nikasala Nuwara (the pure city), and that the ruins being at present overgrown with jungle go under the name of Nuwara-hel\u00e9.\n\n* This does not correspond with the distance of the ruins from the modern town of Kurunegala; but it must be considered that the dimensions of the city of Hastipura or Hastailapura exceeded the limits of the present capital by at least ten times.\n250 stores (gabada geval).\n400 treasuries (aramudal).\n\nA palace for the three seasons* (tun-pahaya): each of the residences stood at one angle of an equilateral triangle, the centre being occupied by the seat Pa\u00f1\u1e0dupul-asna, the seat of \u015aakraya.\n\n25 palaces for the harem (pallewahala geval).\n18 kitchens (u\u1e37u\u1e47en geval), buildings in which u\u1e37u\u1e47en is prepared.\n29 kitchens (muru-ten geval), buildings in which boiled rice is cooked.

They go in advance of the huntsmen, and when game is scented or seen, begin to browse or graze, as if unconcernedly\u2014a sign that is understood by the sportsmen to hasten to the spot and take up a position behind the decoys commanding a view of the prey. Big game, such as elk and deer, is stalked and shot at. The Graphic of March 16, 1895, gives an illustration of a \"sporting buffalo,\" with its owner (a Behar indigo planter) taking cover behind it and shooting over its back at wild-fowl on the banks of a lake. The letterpress, after referring to the savage habits of the animal and its being trained to the plough, proceeds to state: \"Of course he had to do his daily task on the cultivation, but showing himself still uncertain with the native ploughmen, the planter devised the plan of utilizing him as an ambush for wild duck shooting, these birds being quite accustomed to the herds of village buffalo which graze along the margin of the jhils and lagoons. After some practice this bull became very steady under fire, and enabled his master to make some big bags.\"\nFour chief entrances (wasal dora\u1e6du) into the city, with gold and silver and cloth arches surmounting them, the arches being decorated with various kinds of flags, dhaja (flags with flaps), pata-ge (cloth dolls?) having bells suspended to them.\n\nWith the sound of bells (mini-gosav\u00e1) came the neighing of horses, the trumpeting of elephants (kuncha-n\u00e1da), and the five kinds of music (pancha turiya-n\u00e1da).*\n\nA company of women decked in all the female ornaments, like goddesses.\n\nThe royal ministers like those of Iswara.\n\nMen speaking the Tamil, Lada, and Grantha languages.\n\nMen possessing a knowledge of medicine and the practice of charms.\n\n300 great warriors or powerful soldiers.\n\n900 officers or councillors (duggana-al) of Tri Sinhala.\n\n9,000 sculptors (gal-waduwo).\n\n1,000 masons (ulu-waduwo).\n\n12,000 carpenters (dandu-waduwo).\n\n20,000 blacksmiths (navan-dana ach\u00e1ri).\n\n8,000 dhobies.\n\n24,000 men, women, and children (ku\u1e0d\u00e1v\u00e9r\u016b).\n\n2,168 and 68 chiefs (mudali-v\u00e9r\u016b).\n\n3,000 dancers and tom-tom beaters (natana gasana beraw\u00e1yo).\n\nFruit trees of sorts (which are enumerated).\n\n600 wells (ura-lin).\n\n900 ponds (patas; pokunu), streams, and rivulets (ela-dola).\n\nWhen Panduwas was reigning seated on his throne (pandapul asna) seven cubits high, like unto Sakraya, he saw in a dream the form of a devil in a blaze of fire which extended a gawa in height, wearing a hat four gaw in height, holding a club of enormous size, and emitting a flame from his mouth, at the sight of which he fainted away, and on regaining his senses fell ill.\u2020\n\nAt Panduwas Nuwara M\u00fcller found a \"fragment of a pillar in the corner of an opened dagoba with an inscription in five lines.\" He doubts that the tradition that this place is said to bear its name from Panduwas, the nephew of Wijaya, is correct in this point. \"At any rate there are no remains of any kind that point to such a remote period.\"\u2021\n\n* The five sorts of music are said to be the five tones or kinds of music produced from the various sorts of tom-toms or native drums, each yielding a different sound. Tom-toms are used to accompany dancing, singing, and performances on wind instruments. (See Skeen's Adam's Peak, pp. 157, 319. Steele's translation of Kusa J\u00e1takaya, Notes, p. 207.)\n\n\u2020 Then follows an account of his illness, supposed to be the result of devi dossa, the curse of the gods, and of the manner in which he was healed, &c., for which see \"Kurun\u00e9gala Rocks.\"\n\n\u2021 Ancient Inscriptions, p. 59.\nRuins of the City.\n\nSpeaking generally of the ruins, Mr. H. Parker says:\n\nThe only remains of this once royal city consist of a few upright and prostrate stone pillars, the neighbourhood of which is strewn with bricks, and are protected by a brick and earthen wall 40 ft. thick at the base and 8 ft. high, of rhomboidal shape, 100 ft. long and 95 ft. wide, with a fosse now 7 ft. wide.*\n\nPresident M\u00e1rambe, who by excavation and exploration has obtained invaluable details, particularizes the ruins thus:\n\nWithin the walls of the city there is an enclosure of about eight acres of land, surrounded by a low wall, the remains of which are still to be seen. The enclosure is a perfect square, having moats or ditches on all four sides, within and without. A group of thirty-two granite pillars stand eight in a row, about a fathom apart from each other, and forming a square. The pillars are almost imbedded in the ground, and are at present four or five feet above the level of the ground, possibly intended to support the roof of a building.\n\nA flight of rock steps leading to a temple, the sides of the flight of steps being formed of balustrades of rock, with the figure of a crocodile carved in a single block of granite on each side; the entrance door of the temple; a portion of the lintel and of the side\u2014all which were unearthed under direction of the President\u2014are now remaining.\n\nThere are a large number of mounds, probably marking the sites of former buildings, here and there.\n\nSeveral enclosures, similar to the above but differing only in extent, are also met with. In one of these are to be seen traces of a foundation of a large building; the ruins of two large structures, with eleven granite pillars of one and twelve of the other still standing; also two d\u00e1gobas in ruins, showing unmistakable signs of their having been dug into; and remnants of carved stones, pillars, &c.\n\nIn another of the enclosures was found a slab of stone three feet square, containing 28 square holes, like a monster draught-board. The lid of this slab of rock was discovered in the d\u00e1goba near it, and it is said that the holes were intended to contain jewellery, images, &c.\n\n* Report on Panda-vewa (Sessional Papers, 1881).\nThe site of the western wall is still discernible. The pillars of the main gate are still standing, and in clearing portions of the brushwood the trace of the road leading to the M\u00e1lig\u00e1wa revealed itself. The gate appears to have opened into the principal street in the city, and is lined on either side by a number of granite pillars which are yet standing, with occasional mounds, such as have already been mentioned; near to the entrance of the main gate stand 15 square pillars about 8 ft. or 10 ft. above the ground; and on one of these pillars there is an inscription with the sun and moon carved on it, indicating the former existence of a large building.\n\nThere are also the sites of two other buildings, one containing 6 and the other 12 pillars; passing these we come to the site of another structure of 10 pillars, each nearly 10 ft. high, one standing.\n\nThere are numerous ponds about the place, the largest of which, about 200 ft. square, is designated Das Pokuna, in token of the thousand ponds which the city contained. The water of this pond is excellent, and is used by the priests for drinking purposes.\n\nThe ruins of the Relic palace, or Dalad\u00e1 M\u00e1lig\u00e1wa, is 50 ft. long, 30 ft. broad, containing 32 pillars, 12 or 15 ft. high. The floor and the sides are of elaborately carved stones with flight of rock steps like those above described. On one side of the ruins stand 7 pillars, which are said to mark the site of the Mah\u00e1 Vishnu D\u00e9w\u00e1l\u00e9, and near it on an enclosed piece of ground, about five acres, there is a mound, to which tradition assigns the site of the king's palace.\n\nPanda-vewa.*\n\nAt this stage it will be of interest to take leave of the ruins of the ancient city and devote some space to the magnificent tank Panda-vewa, now in utter disrepair, which doubtless in ages past supplied the citizens with wholesome\n\n* Summarized from Mr. Parker's Report on Panda-vewa (Sessional Papers, 1881).\nwater. The tank is a striking object from an historical as well as an engineering point of view. It lies to the north of the ancient city with the W\u00e1riy\u00e1pola-Chilaw road traversing its bed, and extends into two K\u00f3ral\u00e9s, Band\u00e1ra Koswatta (now Tissawa) and Giratalane M\u0119dagandahe K\u00f3ral\u00e9s. It is supposed to have been built by King Pan\u1e0duwas during his reign, and called after him, though it is open to conjecture whether the tank did not receive its name from the city itself at a later period. It is considered to be one of the oldest tanks in the Island, its construction exhibiting, in the opinion of experts, knowledge superior to that displayed in the design of Bassawak-ku\u1e37am built at Anur\u00e1dhapura in the reign of Pan\u1e0duk\u00e1bhayo.\n\nThe tank is formed by an embankment 24 ft. high, and more than a mile and a half long, carried across the valley of the Kolamunu-oya, a stream 60 ft. wide, which rises not far from Kurun\u00e9gala, and, collecting in a course of some 20 miles the surplus waters of the lower hills between these and the tank, in times of flood has a discharge of about 10,000 cubic feet a second. Allowing for some silting up of the bed, the depth of water stored in the tank, thus made, must have been 15 to 18 ft., and the area covered would then have been from 1,000 to 1,200 acres, extending for a length of $2\\frac{1}{2}$ to 3 miles above the bund.\n\nThe tank is referred to in the Mah\u00e1wa\u1e47sa by its ancient name \u201cPan\u1e0dav\u00e1pi,\u201d and King Mah\u00e1 D\u00e1thika, who reigned from the ninth to twenty-first year after Christ, is said to have bestowed the \u201cPan\u1e0dav\u00e1pi\u201d vih\u00e1r\u00e9 on a samaneru of that vih\u00e1r\u00e9, and in like manner the means of maintaining the priesthood.* Whether this refers to the land under the tank is uncertain. The ancient name \u201cPan\u1e0dav\u00e1pi\u201d is evidently a contraction of \u201cPan\u1e0duwasa-w\u00e1pi,\u201d the city itself being sometimes called Panda Nuwara in the early part of this century. An inscription on a rock on the border of the tank, and belonging probably to the second or third century,\n\n* Mah\u00e1wa\u1e47sa, XXXIV., p. 137.\nwas ruthlessly destroyed by the owner of the adjoining land, in order to prevent people from searching for the treasure always believed to be concealed in such places, and thereby invoking the displeasure of the gods!\n\nAccording to the Mah\u0101wans\u0101,* King Wijaya B\u00e1hu I., who reigned 1059\u20131065 A.D., repaired the tank \u201cPandav\u00e1pi,\u201d amongst others, of which the bund had been destroyed, out of his great desire for the welfare of the poor; and he made repairs to the vih\u00e1r\u00e9 \u201cPandav\u00e1pi\u201d amongst others.\n\nA short inscription on a stone post at the back of the Meda-horrowwa, cut by the prosperous Par\u00e1krama, seems to indicate that the tank was in order during the time of that king from 1153 to 1156 A.D.\n\nThe Mah\u0101wans\u0101 says:\n\nThe tank Pandav\u00e1pi, which was aforetime of very small size, he (Par\u00e1krama B\u00e1hu I., surnamed the Great) rebuilt with embankments, greatly enlarged in height and length and breadth, and with sluices to convey a body of water of great and exceeding height, and gave to it the name of the \u201cSea of Parakkama.\u201d\n\nIn the islet in the middle of the tank he built a cetiya (d\u00e1goba) on the top of a rock, like unto the top of Mount Kel\u00e1sa in beauty, and in the centre thereof he built a royal palace of surpassing beauty\u2014three stories high. A palace fit (to draw unto it) the multitude of joys in the world.\u2020\n\nAccording to tradition the tank burst after the time of King Par\u00e1krama B\u00e1hu, and it remained in a ruined state till nearly the end of the last century, when Talgaha-goda Dis\u00e1wa and another repaired it. For a few years the tank continued in good order, but the upkeep of the bund was neglected, and a deep track was worn through it by cattle and people fetching water.\n\nIn 1805, owing to a flood which raised the water till it flowed over the embankment, which was a little over three feet above spill level, the bund burst over-night, creating the present Kolamuna-oya.\n\n* Mah\u0101wans\u0101, LX., pp. 110\u2013111.\n\u2020 Mah\u0101wans\u0101, LXVIII., 39\u201342.\nIn 1814 Kobb\u0113ka\u1e0duwe Diss\u0101wa is said to have visited Panda-v\u0113wa with a view to restore it, but the rebellion which broke out in that year disturbed his arrangements, and he was forced to return to join the royal troops.\n\nUnder British rule the tank seems to have been quite lost sight of, and even as recently as 1837 Turnour, who ought to have known it, refers to it as \"not identified.\" Under these circumstances it is no wonder that unscrupulous settlers squatted on the land in the bed of the tank. Chief among them was a duraya named Kiriya, who removed from his village below the bund to the bed of the tank, where he boldly began to clear and cultivate wherever his fancy led him, claiming title under an alleged gift from a certain Pandakum\u0101rih\u0101mi in favour of one of his ancestors. He sold part of the land, but his assertion of title to the remainder as well as to the high land above the tank, which he commenced clearing, was interfered with by Government. Nevertheless, this enterprising settler died, it is said, a rich man, and his descendants have succeeded to his wealth and to his holdings.\n\nThe bund is 8,600 ft. long and 22 ft. high, with a moderately level top 10 ft. wide and side slopes of about $2\\frac{1}{2}$ to 1. It has three large breaches and one small one, and originally had one main sluice and two high-level ones.\n\nAt breach No. 1 it is said a masonry spill water (pennuma) once existed, and a few of the stones are to be seen in the jungle. A small high-level sluice, called Goda-horrowwa, to the south of the breach, is in rather good preservation.\n\nBreach No. 2, through which the Kolamuna-oya passes, is 90 ft. wide at the base, 200 ft. at the top, and 34 ft. at the greatest depth.\n\nThe main sluice, called the Meda-horrowwa, is 250 ft. to the north of this breach. Between this and No. 1 (2,500 ft. to 2,700 ft.) is the breach repaired by Talgaha-goda Dis\u0101wa, through which the Kolamuna-oya flowed before it was filled.\nFrom 5,300 to 5,620 ft. a large gneiss rock extends in the line of the embankment, which was the former spill.*\n\nAlong the ground immediately in front of it is a series of small broken pillars in pairs, the remains of a foot-bridge once in use. Some stonework, laid without chunam and carried longitudinally over the spill, enables the people to retain about 2 ft. of water above the level of the lower part of the rock, but with the exception of two or three stones it has been quite washed away.\n\nBreach No. 3 extends from 6,540 to 6,675 ft. On its northern side was a second high-level sluice, of which only a few traces remain. Its greatest depth is 30 ft.\n\nAt 7,000 ft. is a small breach 15 ft. deep, through which a footpath passes to the tank.\n\nAt 7,780 ft. the W\u00e1riy\u00e1pol\u00e1-Chilaw minor road crosses the bund.\n\nAmong the d\u00e9bris at the farther end of the bund are to be found some finely carved slabs of rock, some bearing inscriptions. Here, too, is to be seen on the outside of the bund a small bathing-place (a cistern of considerable dimensions) called Bis\u00f3-kotuwa or Bis\u00f3-n\u00e1pu-wala (queen\u2019s bath), the reason of their not bathing in the tank being that it contained crocodiles.\n\nThe contour of P\u00e1nda-v\u00e9wa has been run at a level intended to retain 15 ft. of water at the new sluice, and it is found that 453\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) acres of paddy fields and nine small villages are included in it. The villages are: Andoh\u00e1wa, Dematagolla, Jayasirigama, Ihala Pulund\u00e1wa, Madige Pandava, P\u00e1nda-v\u00e9wa, Pahala Diggalagedara, Pahala Pulund\u00e1wa, and Toragolla, all which will be submerged on the restoration of the tank.\n\nWith the head of water as mentioned above, the length of the tank will be \\(3\\frac{1}{2}\\) miles, covering an area of 1,360 acres, with a capacity of 15,403,000 cubic yards.\n\n* There is a rock in the embankment called by the natives Deviyannekanda, God\u2019s hill, or King\u2019s hill, which they believe is haunted by the spirit of King Mahasen, to whom tradition ascribes the construction of the tank. (Mah\u00e1wans\u00e1, Appendix, p. 383.)\nAccording to the Madras standard, this capacity will be enough for the cultivation of 3,180 acres of field, irrespective of the allowance for the water that will be flowing in while the sowing is in progress.\n\nAt present, during a prolonged rainfall, 681 amunams, equal to about 1,362 acres, are cultivated in the valley of the Kolamunu-oya by damming up the river at various places in its course towards the Deduru-oya and diverting its water over the low-lying lands on its banks; but this water supply cannot be depended on, for with the cessation of rain, which only lasts a few weeks, the whole crop is often lost for want of an occasional shower.\n\nBy the restoration of the tank the supply of water available will be found sufficient to irrigate the whole extent of land, namely, 3,190 acres, that is, 2,240 acres of fields, 890 acres of irrigable land belonging to private parties, and 60 acres of Crown land, all situate under and in the immediate vicinity of the tank.\n\nAccording to the estimate prepared by Mr. Parker, the Irrigation Officer who was specially detailed for the work, the probable cost of restoring the tank will be Rs. 102,591. The restoration will consist of the repair of bund, building two sluices, constructing two gauges, forming a spill water, constructing a foot-bridge, excavating irrigation channel, lines, bridges, and transport and compensation, amounting to Rs. 64,818, while the cost of making a new roadway 3\u00bd miles long, and raising the portion in the tank, as well as constructing an iron bridge 140 ft. long and a 20-ft. culvert, will be Rs. 37,773.\n\nMr. Parker says that the landowners who are to be benefited by the repairs have willingly agreed to pay the whole cost in ten yearly instalments, or to pay a perpetual water-rate. According to his figures the former would necessitate an annual charge of Rs. 4\u00b714 levied on all irrigable lands, and for 1,565 acres in ten years would amount to Rs. 64,791, by which the people will of course be free from any further special taxation. The latter will yield a net\nyearly return of Rs. 11,204, equal to 17 per cent. on the expenditure. If neither be adopted, the Government will have an increase from tithes alone on the lands irrigated and that will be irrigated of Rs. 8,023.\n\nConsidering that the restoration of this tank, large though the cost may appear, offers no illusory prospect of a good revenue, and will be productive of lasting benefits to thousands of people, in a sanitary, social, and financial aspect, and be the means of encouraging the extension of paddy cultivation that will be accompanied by the corresponding decrease of chena cultivation, it is hoped the work will be undertaken before long.\n\nThe D\u00e1gobas and their Ruins.\n\nSome two hundred yards from the bund of the tank are the ruins of a d\u00e1goba, one side of which appears to have been broken into by thieves in quest of treasure invariably enshrined in d\u00e1gobas. The d\u00e1goba is surrounded by rock pillars, which evidently supported a roof. Near here was lately found part of a sedent stone image of Buddha. A large slab of rock indicates the threshold of the entrance to the temple. The centre of the slab is worn hollow, attributed to the passing to and from the temple of the thousands of pilgrims! In the vicinity of the temple and d\u00e1goba are several square granite pillars in the form of a square, probably the site of a pansala.\n\nAbout two or three hundred yards to the south stands K\u014d\u1e6da-vehera, which was in 1877 broken into by thieves. The circumstance was communicated to Mr. Saunders, then Government Agent of the Province, and led to the exploration of the ruins and important discoveries.\n\nMr. Saunders, on January 13, 1877, wrote to the Governor, Sir W. H. Gregory:\n\nFor some weeks past there has been a rumour current that there are large treasures buried somewhere in the Crown jungles now growing on the site of the old city of Panduwas Nuwara. Just before Christmas a Malay man applied to me for permission to search for treasure on condition of receiving one-half of what be found. I had\nreason to suppose that he had already assured himself of success, and wishing to place an effective guard on his operations when he began to dig, I referred the matter to the Rat\u00e9mahatmay\u00e1, and desired the petitioner to wait until after the holidays. During my absence at Christmas it seems that a large number of persons assembled, dug the spot where the treasure was supposed to be, and carried off, some say a large quantity, and some only a small quantity.* I have instituted a strict inquiry and J. P. proceedings, and have recovered some of the treasure, consisting of a gold karanduwa, a gold Buddha, some small gems, and some curious brassware,\u2020 but most of the thieves have absconded, and I believe I have only recovered a small portion of the booty. I am, however, informed that the thieves only penetrated into one chamber of this treasure vault, and that there is reason to suppose a large quantity of treasure is still to be found. I purpose, therefore, to proceed to the spot on Saturday next and make proper search. I trust you will approve of my spending a small sum of money, if necessary, in this investigation. The city of Pan\u1e0duwas Nuwara was the principal city of Ceylon some 2,300 years ago. The articles I have already recovered are evidently of great antiquity, but having been ill-treated and broken by the thieves are almost useless. I propose to make a careful search, so as not to injure the articles which may still be left, and I shall report the result of my search without delay to you. There is a book extant which purports to give the contents of the several vaults wherein treasure has been buried by the ancient kings of the country, and the following extract states what treasures are supposed to be buried on the spot now discovered:\n\nExtract from a copy of a book called \"Wadula.\"\n\n\"In the Ko\u1e6da-w\u0113hera of Pan\u1e0duwas Nuwara-k\u0113l\u00e9 there are nine \"kurunies of waragam, twelve gems, twenty-four relics, one gold \"shrine, a little pearl, and some namaguna beads. They are the \"riches offered to the vehera of King Tissa Maha.\"\n\nThen follows the extract already cited and furnished at the commencement of this Paper, by Jayatilaka Mudaliy\u00e1r, who adds:\n\nAnd it was during his (Tisso) reign that Ko\u1e6da-w\u0113hera alias Tissama-vehera must have been erected about the year 454 B.C., as described in a book called \"Wadula.\" If these facts are to be admitted, we may safely assert that the karanduwa and the pilima are 2,331 years old.\n\n* These rumours were, however, untrue. A few brass lamps, an earthen basin, and a few rough and worthless jewels were all that they had obtained; for they only penetrated to the chamber by a deep hole, and had not time sufficient for their purpose. (Administration Report, North-Western Province, 1876.)\n\n\u2020 Most of these were sent to the Museum by Mr. Saunders, and are included among the exhibits in the \"Antiquities Room.\"\nOn January 24, 1877, Mr. Saunders wrote to the Governor annexing extracts from his diary, showing what progress had been made in excavating the d\u00e1goba referred to. The relics that were discovered were, he believed, of a most interesting description. There could be no doubt of their very great antiquity, even should they not have been buried so far back as 500 B.C.\n\nMr. J. G. Smither, the Government Architect, had promised to furnish drawings of the chamber and a description of the gold figures, and Mr. Saunders proposed at an early date to bring them to Colombo and lodge the images in the Museum.\n\n**Copy of Diary Notes.**\n\n_Sunday, January 14, 1877._\u2014Mr. Penny, Office Assistant, having arrived from Colombo to-day by morning train, I made arrangements to leave Kurun\u00e9gala to inspect the d\u00e1goba at Pan\u1e0duwas Nuwara, which has been robbed by thieves. Left Kurun\u00e9gala, with Mr. Smither, Government Architect, at 6 p.m., and slept at W\u00e1riy\u00e1pola, 13 miles.\n\n_Monday, January 15._\u2014Drove to Het\u1e6dipola, 12 miles; inspected the d\u00e1goba, but not having taken a perpendicular shaft, we entered the first chamber at the north-east end. It is difficult to say whether this chamber was an empty vault, or was filled in with brickwork. I think it was filled in. The thieves hit off the second or lower chamber close to the east wall. This chamber was covered with stone slabs, and to avoid these the thieves had dug under the top stone, and entered by a hole just big enough to admit a man, and, it was presumed, taken all they could find in the chamber. It was unsafe to dig any further at the side lest the mass of brickwork above should fall, so it was determined to dig a proper pit and remove the upper stones of the lower chamber.\n\nI had brought with me an overseer and ten men, and having collected a number of villagers under the Rat\u00e9mahatamay\u00e1 to clear the jungle around, we set to work. The men worked very well, and at about 3 p.m. the stones were removed, and the chamber exposed to view. Though the floor of the chamber was paved, and was some 25 ft. from the supposed top of d\u00e1goba, it was about 6 ft. square and 6 ft. high. (Correct measurements were taken and plans made, which will be furnished hereafter.) At first sight it appeared as if the chamber had been gutted by the thieves. The walls, which were lined with brick on edge, were covered with earth deposited by white ants or worms that had entered the crevices between the bricks. There was an inch or so of this earth adhering to the faces of the wall and in the angles of the wall. In the centre of chamber were two bricks evidently forming\npart of a stand on which the articles stolen had been deposited, and there was the stand of a lamp or offering vase that had apparently been overlooked, and marks on the ground of the other stands that had been removed. After removing the earth from the walls and corners, some old iron spear-heads were discovered in two of the corners, but the iron was so corroded that on removing the earth the spear-heads fell to pieces, and the fragments only could be secured. A careful examination of the walls was then made, and in the centre of one wall a square niche or opening was discovered. This appeared to be full of earth thrown up by worms or white ants, but on removing the earth carefully with a small katty or knife, two gold figures of Buddha were discovered. In each of the other three walls similar niches were found, and in each niche two figures of Buddha in gold. The gold was very pure and bright, but in one case where the Buddha was seated on a silver throne, the silver had become so oxidized that it crumbled away at the slightest touch, and very little of it could be preserved. Careful search was made in the chamber until it was too dark to work any more, but nothing further was discovered.\n\nThe figures were not solid, but had apparently been moulded of clay and wax, or possibly of wood, but the interior had rotted or decayed away, and the gold cases were now filled with earth very similar to that which surrounded the walls and filled the niches.\n\nThe people were a good deal excited at the sight of the gold images and the rumours of the large amount of treasure that had been taken from the chambers before our arrival were current. I made a few inquiries, and being myself satisfied that I had not recovered all the stolen property, I sent over Mr. Ellis, Justice of the Peace,* who was working in the Wanni hatpattu at Nikaweratiya, some 15 or 16 miles off, in order that he might conduct the inquiry.\n\nThe following notes and sketch were made by Mr. Smither:\n\n* Now Inspector-General of Prisons.\nIn the niche B, on the north-west side of the chamber, were found two sedent figures of Buddha of beaten gold, one $3\\frac{3}{4}$ in. high and the other $4\\frac{5}{8}$ in. high, the interior filled with what appears to have been a composition of wax and clay. The larger of these two figures was found seated on a silver pedestal 5 in. wide, $4\\frac{1}{4}$ in. deep, $2\\frac{3}{4}$ in. high. The die of the pedestal was ornamented with moulded pilasters, and the base and cornice enriched with lotus leaves. The figures are seated in the usual attitude, with the soles of the feet upturned and the hands clasped and resting on the lap, palms upwards. The ears are pendent, and each figure has the usual protuberance on the crown of the head surrounded by a gold flame-shaped emblem adorned with precious stones; each wears the curled wig and priestly robe.\n\nIn the niche C, on the north-east side, were two figures of Buddha as before, but 5 in. and $2\\frac{1}{2}$ in. high respectively.\n\nIn the niche D, on the south-east side, a Buddha 4 in. high, similar to those above described, and another 4 in. high, including a base $\\frac{5}{8}$ in. high ornamented with lotus leaves. The latter is of superior workmanship to the companion figure, the features are more refined, and the curls of the wig are smaller than in any of the other examples.\n\nIn the niche A, on the south-west side, were two Buddhas as first described measuring $4\\frac{1}{8}$ in. and $2\\frac{1}{2}$ in. high respectively. The upturned soles of the feet have in each case been painted.\n\nThe following elaborate notes and comments on the find, made by Mr. Parker, in reply to the reference to him by Mr. Saunders, are interesting, in that he refutes the identity of the site with that of the ancient city of Panduwas Nuwara:\n\nI received your letter when at Nikaweratiya, and as I am not very busy here (Mah\u00e1 Usv\u00e9wa) this week, I went over to Hettipola yesterday (February 7, 1877), and examined the two open d\u00e1gobas. The first one I arrived at\u2014the smaller one\u2014is undoubtedly of comparatively modern date, as the enclosed copy of as much of the inscription on one of the pillars as I could decipher conclusively shows. With the exception of one, the shape of the letters is identical with that of the present day, and I believe Dr. Goldschmidt will say the date is not earlier than the sixth or seventh century A.D. The inscription Cotterill copied at Galgamuwa is one of the very old ones which Dr. Goldschmidt says date from the third century B.C., and the shapes of the letters are in all instances quite different from these.\n\nThen, another thing which may be taken to partly prove its erection at a later date than the Anur\u00e1dhapura d\u00e1gobas, is that the bricks, at any rate for some distance\u2014as far as the excavation has gone\u2014round the chamber or chambers are set in chunam. I do not think chunam was\nused internally in the early buildings at Anur\u00e1dhapura, certainly not in the Ruwanw\u00e9li d\u00e1goba. Tennent refers to a similar fact in the case of a structure in India. (Foot-note, vol. I., p. 480.)\n\nIt is also most likely that the roof of the upper chamber (if there were two) was in the form of an arch, as is the case in buildings at Polonnaruwa (Tennent, vol. I., p. 483), for there are no signs of the flat slabs that would otherwise have been employed to hold up the mass of brickwork at the top. Of course this is mere conjecture, there being not the slightest trace of an arch any more than of slabs of stones; but the arch would be of bricks laid horizontally, and all trace of it might be lost if the roof fell in, whilst the stone would still be visible somewhere. Ellis tells me the place was filled with a mass of irregular brickwork, so it is quite probable the roof may have fallen in. I do not think with him that the brickwork was placed there by the builders, for that would render the task of building the chamber entirely useless.\n\nIt is a great pity the upper part of the inscription has been destroyed. It would no doubt have explained the reason for building the d\u00e1goba, and have given the name of the builder.\n\nThe presence of the pillars, let into the ground so firmly as they are, seems to point to a stone roof, or, as the remains of that cannot be found, to a wooden roof supporting the bricks forming the top of the dome.\n\nIt is quite possible this d\u00e1goba may have been built not to contain relics but to commemorate some event, as was the Mirisav\u00e9tiya d\u00e1goba at Anur\u00e1dhapura; but if so, what was the use of a chamber at all? Altogether it seems a puzzle that there should be a chamber containing no relics, unless the place can have been entered perhaps hundreds of years ago and then filled up again. This seems to me the only hypothesis by which to explain the presence of a carefully built chamber completely filled with rough brickwork and containing no relics.\n\nAs for the other d\u00e1goba\u2014that I call your d\u00e1goba, in contradistinction to Ellis's d\u00e1goba\u2014except one or two doubtful points, everything seems to prove its antiquity.\n\nI am sorry I cannot give many references to authorities, my only one being Tennent; but I have looked through his two volumes for anything bearing on d\u00e1gobas, and there are some things difficult to reconcile with the Mudaliy\u00e1r's supposition that the d\u00e1goba was erected by Panduwas, 2,331 years ago.\n\nIn the first place, Buddhism could scarcely be said to have had an existence in Ceylon until long after the reign of Panduwas. Tennent (vol. I., p. 339) says: \"In the meantime the effects of Gotama's early visits had been obliterated, and the sacred trees which he planted were dead . . . His (Wijayo's) immediate successors were so eager to encourage immigration that they treated all religions with a perfect equality of favour. Yakko temples were provided, . . . but no mention is made in the Mah\u00e1w\u00e1nya of a single edifice having been raised for the worshippers of Buddha.\"\nThe Mah\u0101vans\u0101 would never have passed over in silence the endowment of a d\u0101goba in these early times with so many as eight gold images of Buddha, or with the relics undoubtedly deposited in this one. Tennent (foot-note, vol. I., p. 477) refers to a statue of gold in the second century B.C. (Mah\u0101vans\u0101, XXX., p. 180), but from what he says at page 458 it seems probable statues were brought from India, whence almost all the gold in Ceylon has been brought. But in vol. I., p. 344, he says that Asoka, who lived nearly 200 years after Panduwas, was the first of his dynasty to become a Buddhist, and that no building or sculptured stones of a previous date have yet been discovered in India. The Th\u016bp\u0101r\u0101ma d\u0101goba, which is said in the Mah\u0101vans\u0101 to be the oldest in Ceylon, was erected about this time, but not until Mahindo had arrived. It seems almost impossible that a d\u0101goba should have been erected by a king who is not known to have been a Buddhist, and have had figures of Buddha and relics deposited in it nearly 200 years before the Th\u016bp\u0101r\u0101ma was built, and yet no notice of it be taken by a book so particular in mentioning the religious acts of the sovereigns as is the Mah\u0101vans\u0101.\n\nTennent (vol. I., p. 347) also says: \"The images of Gotama which in time became objects of veneration, were but a late innovation;\" and in a foot-note to this states that the first mention of a statue of Buddha occurs in an inscription at Mihintal\u00e9, dated 246 A.D.\n\nPanduwas, having married a relation of Gotama, was certainly the most likely man of that time to be a Buddhist; and if he did not build the d\u0101goba it cannot have been erected till after Mahindo's arrival.\n\nAnother thing against the Panduwas hypothesis is the exact resemblance of the small old d\u0101goba to the Th\u016bp\u0101r\u0101ma d\u0101goba at Anur\u0101dhapura. The Th\u016bp\u0101r\u0101ma, according to this idea, must have been built to resemble it 150 or 200 years after it was buried, which is more than improbable. But it is quite likely it has been made after the pattern of the Th\u016bp\u0101r\u0101ma. The shape of the other d\u0101gobas at Anur\u0101dhapura shows there was not an exact conventional type of d\u0101goba on which they were all designed.\n\nAll the brickwork is laid in mud or clay; this appears to indicate that the d\u0101goba was built at any rate not very much later than the Anur\u0101dhapura d\u0101gobas. It is interesting to notice that whilst the people of that day built these d\u0101gobas with bricks laid in mud, they well knew the use of mortar, the interior of the lower chamber of this one being lined with about an inch of mortar\u2014the stone roof alone excepted. That they were well acquainted with the nature of lime and brick is apparent from the fact of pounded brick, or \"surki,\" being largely mixed with the sand in the mortar. Tennent says that as early as the second century B.C. the Sinhalese made cement from pearl-oyster shells, and that it took a very good polish (Mah\u0101vans\u0101, CXXVII., p. 164).\nExcept that the chambers are rather carefully made, the men, when erecting this dagoba, have rather \"scamped\" the work, many of the bricks being under or overburnt, whilst the mortar lining is very poor indeed, and crumbles away on being rubbed. Where all is so excellent in most old structures in Ceylon, it seems strange that in this, the importance of which is attested by the relic receptacles and gold images, such bad work should have been permitted.\n\nThe absence of an inscription and the setting of the bricks in mud seem to point to the great antiquity of the dagoba; whilst the relics, images of Buddha, and shape of the relic receptacles appear to prove its erection some time after the re-institution and spread of Buddhism in Ceylon.\n\nSir W. H. Gregory addressed the Earl of Carnarvon on the subject, and in connection therewith wrote on May 8, 1877, as follows:\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge your lordship's despatch of 7th ultimo inquiring into the circumstances of the discovery of supposed valuable antiquities in the neighbourhood of Kurunegala.\n\n2. I am happy to say that I believe all the antiquities of any interest have been secured by the energy of Mr. Saunders, Acting Government Agent, from spoliation. They are nine sitting figures of Buddha of different sizes, the highest about six inches. The exterior of the figures is of thin gold plate, the interior of clay. They are now in the Colombo Museum, which is every day receiving valuable accessions of objects of early Sinhalese cult.\n\n3. Every effort is being made by the Government to rescue all valuable objects of gold and silver from the melting pot. Notices are affixed in public places in the different Provinces that the full value of such articles will be given to the legitimate claimant.\n\n4. It is difficult to overcome the suspicion that Government means to lay a strong hand on these articles and to seize them without compensation, but it is to be hoped that after a few instances of full payment of value, the natives will see that Government is a better customer than the bazaar dealers.\n\n5. I subjoin herewith Mr. Saunders' account of the finding of these images, with plans to illustrate the places in which they were buried.\n\n6. I may add that they were found on the site of one of the earliest cities in Ceylon, which is said to have been in existence 500 B.C.\n\nMr. Parker, to whom a proof of this Paper was forwarded, has kindly furnished me with the following note:\n\nIn the short paragraph of mine which you quote, the dimensions of the walled part of the city should be 1,000 ft. by 950 ft. It was surveyed by Mr. Goonewardene in connection with the survey of the tank.\nMy copy of a manuscript termed \"Ka\u1e0daim-pota saha Prad\u00e1na Nuvarawal\" has some variations from that which you quote.\n\nThe chief differences are:\n\n- 400 palaces.\n- 900 buildings with thrones.\n- 1 k\u00fanam (not kuman*) house.\n- 1 aviary.\n- Stables for hunting buffaloes are omitted.\n- Residences for dancing girls are omitted.\n- The tank is stated to be a \"great tank.\"\n- The 300 \"warriors\" are Mah\u00e1 bala yodhayan, \"giants of great strength.\"\n- 8,000 masons.\n- 400 wells lined with earthenware rings (ur\u00e1-lin).\n\nIt would be interesting if you could give a section of the Ko\u1e6da-w\u0113hera d\u00e1goba, showing the two relic-chambers, one over the other. The dimensions of the bricks used in it will be a safe approximate guide to its age; but unfortunately I have not measured them. I have now no doubt that it is of far later date than the time of Panduwas D\u00e9va; it is not likely to belong to pre-Christian times.\n\nThe other d\u00e1goba is of later date than the tenth century. The broken inscribed pillar in it is of that century, and the inscription refers to one of the usual grants made to a vih\u0101r\u0113, from which it must have been removed to its present site inside the d\u00e1goba.\n\nAnur\u00e1dhapura was built on the Kadamba river, which must be the Malwatta-oya. One would therefore expect to find Upatissa Nuwara on the banks of that river; but of course there may have been another river of the same name. On page 34 of the English version of the Mah\u0101vansa it is quite clearly stated, however, that Upatissa Nuwara was north of Anur\u00e1dhapura. The extract regarding it is\u2014\n\n\"On the bank of the Kadamba river the celebrated village called Anur\u00e1dha (was built). To the north thereof, near that deep river, was the village of the Brahmanical Upatissa, called Upatissa.\"\n\nPanduwas Nuwara is therefore not Upatissa Nuwara, where Panduwas D\u00e9va reigned.\n\nPanda-v\u0113wa must, I think, be distinguished from Pand\u00e1-vapi. What I wrote regarding it was that Pand\u00e1-vapi must be the contracted form of Panduvasa-vapi, which Panda-v\u0113wa is not likely to be.\n\nThe extract from the Mah\u0101vansa you give cannot refer to Panda-v\u0113wa, the description of the tank being inapplicable to it. I venture to prefer the translation of the extract given in my report on\n\n* A misprint in the proof, which has been since corrected.\nPadawiya to that which you quote, which contains no reference whatever to the construction of a \"spillwater\" that is mentioned in the P\u00e1li and Sinhalese editions.\n\nSome discussion followed:\n\nMr. A. Mendis, Mudaliy\u00e1r, who was unavoidably prevented at the last moment from attending, in a note addressed to the Honorary Secretary, disagreed with the identification of Panduwas Nuwara with the site in the Kurun\u00e9gala District close to Hettipola. It is doubtful that it was in the North-Western Province at all. If it was different from Upatissa Nuwara it could not have been very far away from it. Now, according to the Mah\u00e1vansa, Upatissa Nuwara stood north of Anur\u00e1dhapura. Besides, it is Anur\u00e1dhapura that was situated on Kolom or Kadamba-oya, not Upatissa Nuwara, which, according to the P\u00faj\u00e1valiya, was in a division of the country called Elsera (perhaps identical with \"Ela Hatara Nuwara\"), and situate (according to the Mah\u00e1vansa) on a river called Gambhira-n\u00e1di. Moreover, there is also a village Moragolla and another called Moragoda, near Elagomuwa, in Nuwarakal\u00e1wiya of the North-Central Province. Great care should therefore be taken in deciding the sites of these ancient cities.\n\nMr. C. M. Fernando said that he felt inclined to discredit Mudaliy\u00e1r Jayatilaka's theory in regard to the identity of the ruins in question with the ancient city of Panduwas Nuwara. Apart from the reasons adduced by Mr. Parker, the discovery within the d\u00e1goba among other things of a Buddhistic rosary, known as the Namagunam\u00e1la, is significant. In the last number of the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Great Britain there is a letter from Colonel Waddell on the subject of the Buddhist rosary. It is established that the use of beads was only known to later and not to primitive Buddhists; therefore the conclusion seems warrantable that the relics found in the d\u00e1goba were enshrined there at a period several centuries later than that of King Panduwas D\u00e9va.\n\nMr. Harward said that he had recently visited Panda-vewa. The map issued by the Survey Department gave a wrong idea of the neighbourhood representing the ancient tank as still in existence, and giving an altogether imaginary course to the river which formerly supplied it with water. Besides the ruins described by Mr. Modder there are interesting remains in the extensive rocks adjoining the bund. He hoped that the site would be thoroughly examined by the Archaeological Survey.\n\n5. Mr. Joseph read the following Paper:\u2014\nROBERT KNOX'S SINHALESE VOCABULARY.\n\nBy D. W. FERGUSON.\n\nIn searching for information relating to Captain Robert Knox, the twenty-years' captive in, and writer of the well-known book on, Ceylon, I happened to consult the manuscripts of Dr. Robert Hooke, Secretary of the Royal Society from 1677 to 1682, which are preserved in the British Museum Library. In one volume of miscellaneous papers (Sloane, 1039) I was fortunate enough to find (on the folios numbered 162\u2013165) a vocabulary of Sinhalese words, partly in Dr. Hooke's handwriting, but chiefly in that of Knox himself. Not being entered in the Catalogue, this interesting document seems to have escaped the notice of scholars\u2014at least I have never met with any reference to it. In his Preface to Knox's Historical Relation, Hooke says: \"He could have given you a compleat Dictionary of their Language, understanding and speaking it as well as his Mother Tongue. But his Occasions would not permit him to do more at present.\" It is probable that this list of words was written shortly after the publication of Knox's work; and it certainly justifies to some extent Hooke's assertion in the first sentence quoted above. A comparison of this list with the Sinhalese words given in Knox's book will show that the former contains a large number of vocables unrecorded in the latter. (For the purpose of comparison, and in order to make Knox's list as complete as possible, I have added, after the words in the manuscript list, those given in the Historical Relation.*)\n\nSinhalese was to Knox, during his enforced residence in Ceylon, purely a spoken language: that he never learnt to read or write it we may\n\n* The explanations are mostly in Knox's own words, though in many cases in an abbreviated form. I have considered it beyond the scope of the present Paper to enter into any lengthy discussion of the various points suggested by the occurrence of certain words in Knox's book.\nassume as certain. Therefore, the words he has recorded for us are those of the everyday speech of the Kandyan Sinhalese of the 17th century; and in this lies their chief value. Most of the words are easily identifiable with their modern Sinhalese equivalents, but in some cases it is difficult to tell what Sinhalese word was intended. Many of the forms given by Knox are, as might be expected, vulgarisms; and a few of the words are now obsolete.\n\nThe vocabulary is written on four leaves of foolscap paper cut into halves, so as to form eight pages. Six of these are closely written upon, the seventh having only two lines of writing, and the eighth being blank. The first page and the top third of the second are in Dr. Hooke's handwriting, the learned scientist having evidently written down each word as Knox spoke it. Having got so far, however, Hooke seems to have handed the sheets to Knox for the latter to continue the list of words; first, however, writing down for Knox's guidance the system of symbols which he (Hooke) had adopted to represent the Sinhalese vowel sounds. Knox, however, seems to have paid no attention to these, but to have written the words after his own fashion, so that Hooke had to go over his list and make many alterations in the spelling.* (The accents have also been added by Hooke.) Hooke's system of spelling, it will be seen, aims at scientific accuracy; while Knox's is entirely unscientific. Between the two, however, we get a good idea of the sounds intended to be represented.\u2020 It will be noticed that in the Sloane manuscript list there is a certain systematic arrangement of the words; in the list of words which I have copied from Knox's book the arrangement is naturally not so regular. For purposes of comparison I have numbered the words (or,\n\n* These alterations I have shown within brackets [ ]. In several cases it is impossible to decipher Knox's original spelling, owing to Hooke's corrections. The ink used by Hooke is much blacker than that with which Knox wrote.\n\n\u2020 I have drawn up tables showing the very varied method in which both Hooke and Knox have, in the manuscript vocabulary, represented the same Sinhalese sound.\nin some cases, sentences), and have given cross-references where similar forms occur. The separation of the Sinhalese words and their meanings into two columns is adopted for the sake of clearness. In the original manuscript there is no such division. The erratic punctuation of the original has also not been followed.\n\nI have to acknowledge, with thanks, my indebtedness for the elucidation of various words to Messrs. Don M. de Z. Wickremasinghe, W. P. Ranasiha, T. B. Panabokke, T. B. Pohath, C. Drieberg, and H. C. P.

JL., XL., p. 553):\u2014\"....... for close quarters some [of the soldiers in Ceylon] have small broadsword, which are called calilachurras.\" Mr. T.B. Panabokaer, in reply to an inquiry as to the origin of this word (or words), writes:\u2014\"I have never heard the name of such a weapon as callacurre in the Kandyan country. My inquiries since the receipt of your note from low-country Sinhal\u5373ehave not led to any better result. The word kalla-bondayi is very familiar here. It is a small dagger enexcelled in a stick\u2014in fact a sword-stick. Kyallabondayi and kallahura, as we would know spell the latter word, may be identical. The origin of the word may be Tamil, halhu meaning hidden secret, or bondedi or sura case. Sura and bondedi are quite capable of designing I attribute to them. The word kallaxia is in the mouth of everyone. The surname Kelansuri Arachchige used by low-country Sinhal\u5373e is, I think, due to the use of the weapon referred to by Ribeiro. The ancestors of these men may have served in regiments composed of soldiers using these weapons.\"\n| Knox's Vocabulary | Meaning                  | Sinhalese         | Transcript, &c. |\n|------------------|--------------------------|-------------------|----------------|\n| 353              | a sea fight              | moonda-h\u00e9vakom    | muhudu h\u00e9v\u00e1kama, cf. 53, 335 |\n| 354              | a marchant               | vellandam-carre[-karre] | vel\u0101ndamk\u00e1ra[y\u00e1], cf. 603 |\n| 355              | ye flag                  | [C\u014dd\u00e6]            | kodi[ya]        |\n| 356              | a goldsmith              | budd\u00e4lla          | bad\u00e1l\u0101           |\n| 357              | a potter                 | budh\u00e1l\u0101           | badah\u0113lay\u00e1       |\n| 358              | a carpenter              | W\u00e1dduah           | waduw\u00e1           |\n| 359              | a hammer                 | Mittea            | mitiya           |\n| 360              | a file                   | p\u0113ere             | pira             |\n| 361              | a saw                    | ke\u00e1tea            | kiyata           |\n| 362              | a Chisell                | nean-c\u00f3ttua       | niyan ka\u1e6duwa*    |\n| 363              | a cooke                  | w\u014dung-puddeo      | vahunpuray\u00e1      |\n| 364              | a weaver                 | vereway           | peher\u00e1 = weaver.

But it is to be observed, That here are Diversity of Dialects, as in the several Provinces of other Countries, and so the Inland Cingularians differ from the Borderers; which makes Rob. Knox in his description of Ceylon give a different Account; and generally writes with an o what I put down with an a, as, Echoi, Dechoi, Tunhoi, Hatterhoi, Pahhoi, Hoyhoi.\"\n| Sinhalese | English |\n|----------|---------|\n| dolahayi | leaf used for writing letters, &c., on |\n| dahatunayi | almanacks |\n| dahahatarayi | nativity |\n| pahalohayi | a. year |\n| dahasayayi | names of months |\n| dahahataci | Sunday |\n| dahahatayi | |\n| dahahavayayi | |\n| vissayi | |\n| tihayi | |\n| hatalihayi | |\n| panahayi | |\n\n* Read \"Nickenemaha.\"\n| Knox's Vocabulary | Meaning |\n|------------------|---------|\n| 737 Sandudah     | Monday  |\n| 738 Onghorudah   | Tuesday |\n| 739 Boadah      | Wednesday |\n| 740 Braspotindah| Thursday |\n| 741 Secouradah   | Friday  |\n| 742 Henaouradah  | Saturday |\n| 743 Dausak      | day     |\n| 744 Pay          | hour    |\n| 745 Cahah mirris | turmeric and pepper |\n| 746 Neur        | p. 112. |\n| 747 Lalla       | a city  |\n| 748 Dallugauhah  | put into the river |\n| 749 Warraco     | a tree of a soft substance bearing only thorns |\n| 750 Jawpolls    | leaf of a plant in colour like a cabbage leaf |\n| 751 Mockmacola  | a little long greenish berry |\n| 752 Ouleande-cole| a leaf very like our tunhoof or ground-ivy |\n| 753 Goderacole  | two herbs |\n| 754 Condoura giddi | a fruit of a tree in form somewhat like a mussel |\n| 755 Moungoutia  | p. 115. |\n\n| Sinhalese |\n|----------|\n| Sa\u00f1\u00f1ud\u0101, Transcrip., &c. |\n| A\u00f1\u00f1eharuvadd\u0101, cf. 374 |\n| Bad\u0101d\u0101, cf. 375 |\n| Brahaspatind\u0101, cf. 376 |\n| Sikkuradd\u0101, cf. 377 |\n| Henahuradd\u0101 (for Senasuradd\u0101), cf. 378 |\n| davasak = a day, cf. 371 |\n| peya kaha-miris |\n| nuwara l\u0101la, conj.-past part. of lanaw\u0101, put daruk gaha=Euphorbia antiquorum |\n| var\u0101 kola = leaf of Calotropis gigantea, cf. 98, 380 |\n| j\u0101p\u0101la = Croton tiglium |\n| mukunu(yenna) kola = leaves of Alternanthera trinandra, cf. 98, 380 |\n| ulkenda kola |\n| godarav\u0101la? |\n| kaduru ged\u012b = fruits of divikaduru (Tubernemorontana dichotoma), cf. 101 |\n| mugatiy\u0101 = mongoose |\n| Page | Sinhalese Phrase | English Meaning |\n|------|-----------------|----------------|\n| 756  | Bonder          | something belonging to the king |\n| 757  | Diabat          | God bless, or keep you* |\n| 758  | Coracari tallipa | a kind of hasty pudding |\n| 759  | Hour\u00e9           | brother |\n| 760  | Courtalbad      | chief over all the smiths and carpenters |\n| 761  | Beia pas mettandi hitta pas ettandi | he serves me for fear and them for love; or his fear is here and his love is there |\n\n* The sentence in which this word occurs runs as follows:\u2014\"Thus bidding him and the rest of the Neighbours farewell, we departed, they giving us the Civility of their accustomed Prayers, Diahac, that is, God bless, or keep you.\" In the Errata Diabat is corrected to Diabat, so that the latter form must be taken as what Knox intended to write, but what Sinhalese expression is meant to be represented I cannot tell. [Probably Deviyo raku, \"God keep (you).\"\u2014B.]\nWords given in List of Curiosities from Tonquin, presented by Knox to Royal Society, Nov., 1683.\n\n(Birch's History of the Royal Society, vol.

I suspect that \"murtas\" is a misprint for \"murlas,\" in which case the \"mora\" (Nephelium longana) is intended, an alternative name for which is \"murale,\" from Tamil \"morali,\" probably. Cf. 414.\n\n\u2020 A misprint, doubtless, for \"kerenda-atta,\" meaning \"kiri\u1e47\u1e0di-\u0113ta\" = seeds of Coix lacryma.\nMr. F. H. Modder said that his long residence in the Kurun\u00e9gala District, in which the Knoxes (father and son) spent the early part of their captivity, gave him some claim to speak on the subject. The following are some of the criticisms which he offered:\n\n5, 6. These are respectful terms, used especially by the illiterate, e.g., the Vedd\u00e1s. Cf. Tamil sandamama.\n\n28. Knox may mean dummala, \"resin.\" It is of different kinds: hal dummala, resin obtained from hal trees; dun dummala, from dun trees; and bin dummala, from the earth. Dumbulu is soot. Both dumbulu and dummala are used medicinally, and are relied on as specifics to stop bleeding, just in the same way as cobwebs are.\n\n48. More fully oya fukk\u00f3 (oya-ahabada), bordering or in the neighbourhood of the oya. So\u2014\n\n49. kumbura ahaba\u1e0da (kumbura-ahabada), bordering or in the neighbourhood of the field.\n\n77. tambakka (tambakka), is pinchbeck.\n\n91. dandulija (dandulija) is a piece of stick tied across the neck of cattle to prevent their breaking through fences and trespassing on plantations. li-danglu (li-danglu) means timber.\n\n120. godura (godura) now means food in general; bait is ema (ema).\n\n132. vedakaraya sappay\u00e1 (vedakaraya sappay\u00e1) is also applied, endearingly, to a human being in the sense of the working man or breadwinner.\n\n133. val sappay\u00e1 (val-sappay\u00e1, lit. \"wild animal\"), used contemptuously for a silly person.\n\n265. Sumbera never used by the Sinhalese for \"hat\" or \"cap.\" A handkerchief (uram\u00e1la) is commonly used by the natives; headmen and other respectable and influential natives affect the well-known \"pincushion hat,\" which however is not designated somberu, though it is entitled to be and answers all the purposes of, an umbrella.\n\n339. The calachurro, described as a sabre, could not have been so small an instrument as the kalla-bondiya; it must have been the kala-cris or kala-kirichiya, a large dagger imported from the maritime provinces. Kala means deadly, as in kala tuvakkwa.\n\n400. varupalla (varupalla) not varapala (varapala). It is the paddy that remains at the \"bottom\" (palla) of the \"heap\" (varuwa) gathered after threshing, and is given away to the cultivator, while the heap is taken by the landowner.\n\n408. panividakar\u00e1ya (panividakar\u00e1ya) more correctly \"messenger.\"\n\n477. Read balugeta (balugeta), from chataka, \"servant\" or \"hireling.\" Sanskrit bhrutaka. Bhati means \"support,\" \"maintenance,\" \"wages,\" \"hire\"; hence balu. Geta comes from Sanskrit gata, \"having gone to,\" i.e., devoted to, or followed. So balugeta would imply a devoted and loyal servant of the king.\n\n543. Read yakpeti (yakpeti). Mr. L. Nell in his Paper on \"The Archaeology of Sinhalese Gastronomy,\" commenting on the word as spelt and used by Knox, surmised that it was no doubt intended for koppa-pittu, so called from the shape. It is not so. Yakpeti is a well-known kind of Kandyan sweetmeat. Probably it received its name from the circumstance of its forming the chief component among the offerings in a devil ceremony.\n\n* Mr. Modder exhibited a fine specimen of the kala-cris, large enough to be fairly described as a sword.\n576. \u0db8\u0dd2\u0da0\u0dca\u0da0\u0dd3\u0dbb (n\u00e1chchir\u00e9), a term used in addressing Moorwomen and females of the Blacksmith caste.\n\n765. This is undoubtedly \u0db8\u0dd4\u0dbb\u0dd4\u0da7 (muruta); Tamil kadalipuwa.\n\nA manuscript communication was read from F. W. de Silva, Mudaliy\u00e1r.\n\nMr. C. M. Fernando wished only to make one remark: that was to correct Mr. Ferguson in his assumption that the word \u0dc0\u0dcf\u0dad\u0dd4\u0dbb (watura) was derived from the Dutch and English \"water.\" This is wrong. Sinhalese grammarians classify Sinhalese words into three divisions: (1) words purely Sinhalese, or nispanna; (2) words which are identical with their Sanskrit and P\u0101li equivalents; (3) words which are Sanskrit and P\u0101li derivatives. Watura is of the first kind. Its relationship to English cannot be traced through the cognate languages, as in the case of the words like n\u00e1ma (name), &c. It is however a purely Sinhalese word, and known to the language in pre-Dutch times. It occurs in the Namavaliya (1421 A.D.); and the Sidat-sangar\u0101va, which we have reason to believe was published about a century earlier, contains a quotation of a book called Am\u00e1-watura (\"sweet water\"), a word which is used as a synonym of Nirw\u00e1na. The word watura literally means flowing water. A similar nispanna word bearing resemblance to its English equivalent is \u0db8\u0dcf\u0daf, mada, mud.\n\n7.

M. Fernando, in supporting the resolution, dwelt on the fact that the late Dr. Trimen was the only Fellow of the Royal Society who had spent his life in this Island. He was a gentleman of great achievements, and he (the speaker) thought that if he had chosen to cast his lot in England he might have been even more widely known. But he was a modest man, and had been content to pass his life in Ceylon. He had left behind work which would live for years to come. As a Ceylonese he desired to express his appreciation of the work done by him, and he felt that the loss they had sustained would be difficult indeed to replace.\n\n5. Mr. Harward read the following Paper:\u2014\nPLACE NAMES IN THE VANNI.\n\nBy J. P. LEWIS, C.C.S.\n\nTo ascertain the meanings of the names of places in a long-settled district is as a rule by no means an easy task, owing to the changes they have undergone in the course of ages. This has been well put by a writer in the \"Madras Journal of Literature and Science\":* \"All proper names were, or were originally derived from, words or sounds having a meaning; but process of time and the long-continued wear and tear of familiar use have rubbed off the corners that were rough to the tongue, and have run together the liquid parts that most easily coalesced. With the original form the meaning has also been lost, and it is generally very difficult, almost impossible, to discover them. Still, local circumstances and traditions occasionally point to the true etymology, whence the original form may be approximately reconstructed or fairly guessed at; but there is a very general impression that the tradition itself has been often invented to account for the name.\"\u2020\n\n* Names of Places in Tanjore, by Colonel Branfill in the volume for 1879.\n\n\u2020 There are numerous instances of this to be met with in Ceylon; for instance, the explanation of the name Anur\u00e1dhapura as being \"the city of ninety kings,\" because over ninety kings had reigned in it, which would mean that it did not get its name until the 90th king had at least begun his reign (see Ceylon Literary Register, vol. III., p. 296).\n\nAnother is the explanation of the name M\u00e1kawita quoted by Casie Chitty (Gazetteer, p. 152) from a Mission Report:\u2014\"When the famous temple at Dondra-head was in progress, the inhabitants of this village were ordered to display their generosity by feeding the crows. The words used in calling them, h\u00e1 k\u00e1 wita, were uttered so often, that the name was afterwards given to the village with the change of the first letter.\" I may mention that there is more than one M\u00e1kawita in Ceylon, and I suppose the crow-calling episode occurred in each before the village had acquired any name at all.\n\nI have met with very good instances of this tendency in the Negombo District, where some of the villages have very curious names; as for example, Watin\u00e1paha and N\u00e1llapaha. The explanation given me of the former was that once a sweet potato grew there that measured five cubits in circumference. N\u00e1llapaha was explained as being really \"Nallapaw,\" \"do not seize (them), it is a sin,\" and the story relied on to account for the\nfound in the Vanni are not of sufficient antiquity, and have not been subject to this process long enough to have undergone much change, and their meaning is therefore evident enough.\n\nThis is due to the fact that this part of the country was colonized by its present occupants in comparatively modern times, and that the former Sinhalese inhabitants were driven from the villages to the southern districts. The invaders gave new names to the villages which they occupied, and to the tanks which they had not destroyed. Many villages, no doubt, were not occupied at all owing to the destruction of the adjoining tanks, and in this way the old Sinhalese names disappeared and were forgotten. The task of explaining the present names of places in the Vanni is therefore comparatively an easy one.\n\nThe tank is everywhere the great necessity of the country, and without the tank the village could not exist.* Accordingly we find that nearly every village is called after its tank, and in the great majority of names the affix is one of the numerous words employed in Tamil to denote a tank or a pond. There are nine of these in use in the Vanni, viz.:\n\n- Kulam = a tank\n- Madu = a tank\n- M\u00f3\u1e0ddai = a pond, tank (not given by Winslow)\n\nname was that the village is on the boundary between the Alutk\u00faru and Hapitigam k\u00f3ral\u00e9s, and that some people fleeing from justice, or rather from the King of Kandy, crossed over from the latter into the former k\u00f3ral\u00e9. When it was suggested that their pursuers should also cross over and arrest them, some one said: \"Do not touch them, it would be a sin\"\u2014N\u00e1llapaw. This is the only explanation of the name of the village that I could obtain.\n\nTo go from the names of places to the names of plants upon which they are often founded, I should be inclined to doubt the fantastic derivation of the name for sweet potato, batala, from bata \"rice\" and le \"blood,\" given in the Journal of this Society for 1891\u201392, pp. 125\u20136, and to suggest that it is merely a Siphalese corruption through the Portuguese of the Haytian word batata, from which potato is also derived.\n\n* It is owing to this intimate connection between the two that the words for tank and village become interchangeable. I have heard Sinhalese villagers of the Vanni talk of the tank as gama. Mr. Ievers says gama is used for paddy field in the North-Central Province. The tank, the field, the village\u2014one implies the other.\nK\u00e9ni = in Jaffna a well, here a tank\nN\u00edr\u00e1vi = a well, a tank\n\u00d3dai = a channel, a tank\nKuli = a hole, pit, a tank\nVil = villu, a pond\nT\u00e1lvu = depth, water, a tank\n\nOf these words, as regards popularity ku\u1e37am is easily first. Out of 555 names of tanks and villages I have counted 332, or about three-fifths, ending in ku\u1e37am, whereas there are only 24 ma\u1e0dus, 7 m\u00f3\u1e0dda\u00efs, 4 k\u00e9ni\u015b, 3 \u00f3dais, and the same number of vils, and a solitary talvu.*\n\nThere are shades of difference in the meaning of these words, no doubt, but why a tank is generally called a ku\u1e37am, but sometimes a ma\u1e0du\u2020 or a k\u00e9ni, I am not able to say. There does not appear to be any difference in the appearance of a ku\u1e37am, a ma\u1e0du, or a k\u00e9ni: they all have bunds, and are artificial. A k\u00e9ni in Jaffna means a large well walled completely on three sides and with a sloping path leading down to it on the other, but in the Vanni it simply means an ordinary tank with a bund, and is indistinguishable from a ku\u1e37am. A vil or villu is a natural pond, and therefore has no bund.\n\nJust as the affix is nearly always some word denoting a tank, the village or tank usually takes the first part of its name from some tree or plant.\u2021 These are the most conspicuous objects everywhere, and on or near the tank bunds the finest specimens of the different varieties of trees are generally to be found. Consequently, in naming the tank the first thing thought of is some tree with which it is especially connected in the minds of the cultivators; hence the greater number of tanks, and therefore of villages, are called after trees. Of these, though it is not indigenous to the country, by far the most popular is the tamarind. I have counted nearly forty villages and tanks called after this tree,\n\n* I have come across one ku\u1e37i, but cannot recall the name. This termination is more common in the Mannar District.\n\u2020 Some of the largest tanks are called mandus.\n\u2021 See Appendix.\nwhich is generally found in every village clearing. The name \"Puliyankulam\" is hardly more distinctive than Jones as a surname in Wales, or Fernando on the west coast from M\u00e1ravila down to Kalutara, or Silva among the low-country Sinhalese generally, and accordingly other prefixes are necessary in addition, and we have many Puliyankulams named after different personages or castes, as well as big and little Puliyankulams, &c.*\n\nNext to the tamarind comes the maruta, or kumbuk as it is called in Sinhalese, which from its size is conspicuous at all the tanks, with about two dozen derivatives; then the nochchi or nika (Sin.), the kul\u00e1 or Ceylon oak (Sin. k\u00f6n), the n\u00e1val (Sin. m\u00e1dan), the v\u00e9l (Sin. mah\u00e1-andara), the woodapple (Tamil vil\u00e1), each with about a dozen, followed by the halmill\u00e1, kuruntu (Sin. pamburu), suriya (Tamil puvarasu), pa\u00f1chchai (Sin. timbiri), banyan, and margosa, with each half a dozen. Besides these dozen varieties of conspicuous trees over fifty species of trees, creepers, grasses, and other plants are represented in smaller numbers. Strange to say, the satinwood tree, which is common in many places, gives its name to a single tank only, Mutiran-kulam in Udaiyaur, while the p\u00e1lai, also common, and the ebony tree have each but two representatives.\n\nSometimes the tank or village takes its name from some physical feature or peculiarity in its situation or construction. Such are the following names:\u2014\n\nAlaikallupp\u00f3\u1e0d\u1e0dakulam ... (Sin. Relapan\u00e1-wewa.) Tank (the bund of which is) faced with wave-stones. This is what is called in the North-Central Province r\u0113la p\u00e1na, \"the stone revetment on the inner slope of the bund to prevent scour by waves\" (Ievers). There are at least four tanks called by this name in the Vanni, and in the case of one of them which is in Sinhalese hands the name has got Sinhalacized and abbreviated into Alagalla\n\n* E.g., Karuvalpuliyankulam, Vayirava, Kakkaiyar, Kartik\u00e9sar, Kopala, Panikkar, Vann\u00e1n, &c.\nChedik\u00e9ni ... tank with weeds\nCheliy\u00e1villu ... pond which does not thrive (cheli = thrive)\nKalolunk\u00e1npuliyankulam* ... tamarind tank where stones are placed in order. This name must have much the same signification as the preceding\nKallukkon\u1e0damadu ... (Sig. Galkandamadyu.) This I think must be an example of the opposite process to that mentioned with respect to Alagalla, i.e., it is a Sinhalese word Tamilized (and with a Tamil termination added), viz., Gal-kanda \"rock-hill.\" If, however, it is a Tamil word, it should probably be written Kallukkonramadu, \"tank where people are killed by impaling.\" The Sinhalese meaning is a more likely one\nKalidaddinakulam ... tank where the stone was set up\nKannaddiveli ... plain where the stone was placed\nKudit\u00e1nkinnakulam ... tank bordering the village\nMan\u1e0dakatt\u00e1lvu ... pond whose bed is deep. Mondakam \"deepest part of a tank\" (not given by Winslow)\nMarantallinirakulam ... tank where trees stand far apart\nMatavuvaittakulam ... tank in which a sluice is placed. Matavu = matalu, a sluice\nM\u00fa\u1e47numurippu ... three breaches (not a pair of ditto). I know of at least six tanks in the Vanni called by this name\nMurikan\u1e0di ... cut (in the bund) where the breach occurred\nPalamaikallu ... stone of eld\nTekilpadarnt\u00e1n\u00ed ... (place) overgrown with tekil (a creeper)\nT\u00e9r\u00e1vil ... pond, the water of which is not clear (from root t\u00e9ru)\nVattappalai ... place where the water never dries up (vattu = dry up)\nP\u00e1kkuchchori\u00f1ch\u00e1n ... where arecanuts were abundant\nPa\u00f1aininr\u00e1n ... where the palmirah tree stood\nVakaikaddina Olukkulam lotus tank where the vak\u00e1i tree (Cassia marginata) was planted (?)\n\n* This beats, in number of syllables, the Welsh Llanfairmathernarneithaf, but cannot hold a candle to Llanfairpwlechgwyngergobwlchlandysiliogogo. It is, however, fair to say that I have met with the latter name only in verse.\nA curious and favourite method of naming places is to call them after some single event, sometimes quite trivial, connected with them in the minds of those new settlers who, unacquainted with their original names, first found some other method of describing them necessary. Of this kind are the following names:\n\nAliyanch\u00e1yntakulam ... tank where the elephant fell down\nAnaipidditakulam ... tank where the tusked elephant was caught*\nAnaivilunt\u00e1n ... where the elephant fell\nKarippaddamurippu ... breach (in bund) where the elephant died.\n\nThe next village is called Manav\u00e1lampaddamurippu; and Manav\u00e1lan, which means \"bridegroom,\" is said to have been the name of another elephant which died here\n\nKid\u00e1ppidditakulam ... tank where the buffalo was caught\nKid\u00e1chch\u00fari ... where the buffalo stuck in the mud\nManiyrakulam ... tank where the deer stood\nM\u00e1vid\u00e1lunk\u00e9ni ... tank where the deer got away\nMaraiyadittakulam ... tank where the elk (sambur) was struck\nMaraikkutti ... where the elk was stabbed (kuttu = pierce)\nNarikadittap\u00fandi ... village (grove) where the jackal bit\nPulip\u00e1nchakallu ... rock where the leopard jumped\nPanrichurichch\u00e1n ... where the pig stuck in the mud\nPanrikeytakulam ... tank where the pig was shot with an arrow\nUdumupp\u00e1nch\u00e1n ... where the iguana ran\n\u00c1riyankurichuddakulam ... tank where \u00c1riyan branded (cattle). \u00c1riyan is a sort of Balbus of the Vanni. There is another tank called \u00c1riyakkonr\u00e1n, \"where \u00c1riyan was killed,\" and he has also a ma\u1e0du called after him. (The proper name \u00c1riyan, however, has the initial A long, but in these names the long sound seems to have been lost)\n\nKurivaichch\u00e1n ... where the branding was done\nKuriyiddakulam ... do. do.\nKurichuddakulam ... do. do.\n\n* An incident of this kind has given its name to a whole pattu in the Chilaw District, viz., the Anaiviluntan Pattu of Pi\u1e6digal K\u00f3ral\u00e9 North. The pattu, which bore this name in Knox's time, as appears from his map, takes it from a village the name of which has been Sinhalacized into \u00c1nawilund\u00e9wa. There are also in the North-Central Province the form \u00c1naolond\u00e9wa, and a Sinhalese name Aliyaw\u0119\u1e6du\u1e47uw\u0119wa (in which case, however, the elephant that came to grief was not a tusker).\nKomparuttama\u1e0du ... tank where the horn was cut\nKompuvaittakulam ... tank where the horn was put\nMayilmuddaiyiddakulam ... tank where the peafowl laid eggs\nOdduchuddi\u00e1n ... where the paddy stalks were burnt\nOddaruttakulam ... tank where the stalks were broken (or fell to the ground)\nCh\u00faduveyntapulavu ... h\u00e9n\u00e1 where the stalk was burnt\nKarappukutti ... where fish were caught with a karappu (a kind of fishing basket)\nAmmivaitt\u00e1n ... where the grinding stone was placed\nKod\u00e1liparichch\u00e1n ... where the axe was wrested away\nIddmuriinch\u00e1n ... where the spear was broken\nPadd\u00e1damurinch\u00e1n ... where the necklace was broken\nParaniddakallu ... rock where the platform for shooting (para\u1e47) was put up\nPorikkadavai ... entrance where trap was set\nAlavedduv\u00e1n ... where the banyan tree was cut\nPirappuvedduv\u00e1n ... where rattans were cut\nKalvedditidal (corruptly Kalavedditidal) ... high ground where stone was cut\nUnch\u00e1lkaddi ... where the swing was put up\nV\u00e1lalvaittakulam ... tank where the plantain tree was planted\nVayiramchayntakulam ... tank where hardwood fell\nVedivaittakallu ... rock which was blasted\nVilakkuvaittakulam ... tank where lamp was placed\nMuriy\u00e1ku\u1e37am ... tank which did not breach\n\nI annex a table of prefixes and affixes, with a classified list of other words occurring in Vanni place names, with their meanings so far as I have been able to ascertain them.\n\nThe list of words with meanings unknown will show what still remains to be done to complete the task of explaining place names in the Vanni, and on this part of my subject no doubt some of the Members of the Society will be able to make valuable suggestions.\n\nI.\u2014PREFIXES.\n\nCh\u00e9ru ... mud ...

I am unable to say to which language they belonged originally:\n\n| Sinhalese                  | Tamil               |\n|---------------------------|---------------------|\n| Anthocephalus cadamba (Miq.) | ka\u1e0dambu             |\n| Berrya Ammonilla (Roxb.)   | chaman\u1e0dalai         |\n|                           | chavandalai         |\n|                           | chamalai            |\n| Oldenlandia umbellata (L.) | s\u00e1yan s\u00e1ya          |\n| Zizyphus jujuba (Lam.)     | ilanda              |\n| Moringa pterygosperma (Gaertn.) | murunga           |\n| Phyllanthus emblica (L.)   | murunkai            |\n| (Moss)                    | nelli               |\n| Pavetta indica (L.)        | p\u00e1si                |\n| Hemicyclia sepiaria (W. & A.) | w\u00edr\u00e1              |\n|                           | v\u00edrai               |\n\nIt is interesting to note that some of the Sinhalese and Tamil names of plants have been adopted, of course in a Latin form, as the scientific names of the genera and species to which they have been assigned.

P. LEWIS, C.C.S.\n\n[ADRIAN RELAND, a learned Orientalist, was born July 17, 1676, at Rijp, a hamlet in North Holland, his father being Minister in the place. After Adrian's birth the father removed to Amsterdam, and in that city the education of the youth commenced. At the early age of eleven he had gone through the usual classical course. Under the guidance of Surenhusius, the next three years were devoted to the Hebrew, Chaldee, Syriac, and Arabic languages. He then entered the University of Utrecht, and after a three-years' course was admitted to the degree of Doctor in Philosophy. His University studies were commenced under Graevius and Leusden, and his divinity course was begun under Wetsius. He next removed to Leyden, and soon after became tutor to the son of the Earl of Portland, King William's favourite. In 1699 he was chosen Professor of Philosophy at Hardenwyk; but he quitted this situation in a short time, as on the recommendation of King William he was appointed Professor of Oriental Languages and Ecclesiastical Antiquities at Leyden. He held this situation seventeen years, and died in his forty-second year, of smallpox, on February 5, 1718. The great erudition and sound mind of Reland are conspicuous in all his works. The principal of these are:\u2014\"De Religione Mohammedica\" in 1715, a useful book for the time; \"Dissertationes Miscellane\u00e6\" in 1716,*]\n\n* This I think is a mistake. I have before me the third and last volume of this work, and it was published in 1708 at Utrecht. The title page is:\n\nHadriani Relandi\nDissertationum\nMiscellanearum\nPars Tertia\nEt Ultima\nTrajecti ad Rhenum.\n\nEn Officina Gulielmi Broedelet Bibliopol\u00e6, MDCCVIII.\nan able and interesting collection; \"Analecta Rabbinnica\" in \"1702\"; \"Antiquitates Sacrae\" in 1708, a useful compendium or text book; \"Dissertationes Quinque De Nummis Veterum Hebraeorum\"; and \"De Spoliis Templi.\" His principal work\u2014his enduring monument\u2014is his \"Palestina ex Monumentis Veteribus Illustrata.\" Recent travel has added greatly to our knowledge of the Holy Land, but Reland's work remains a study for all writers in sacred geography. Peter Reland, his brother, compiled a good and valuable \"Fasti Consulares,\" printed after his death in 1715 (Imperial Dictionary of Universal Biography).\n\nThe XIth chapter of Part III. of the \"Dissertationes Miscellaneae\" is styled \"De Linguis Insularum Quarundam Orientalium,\" and treats of Malay, Sinhalese, Malabar, Javanese (which he says is now mixed with Malay), Japanese, Siamese, Annamese, the languages of the Solomon Islands, of the Cocos Islands, of New Guinea, of some islands called \"Mosis\" and \"Moo,\" and of Madagascar (noting its connection with Malay).\n\nThe following is a translation from the original Latin of sections 1 to 8 of this chapter (pp. 57-91):\n\nI.\u2014On the Malay Language used in several Oriental Islands.\n\nThe Malay language is so extensively used through the islands of the East, that it is difficult to treat of the languages of these islands without making some preliminary remarks concerning the idiom of the Malays. This is the more necessary on account of the scarcity of works which help towards a knowledge of that language. On this account I hope that I may not only obtain the praise of such as desire to acquire that knowledge, but to effect a work which will be pleasing to such as wish to compare other languages with the Malay, or to read what I have written about the languages of some of the islands of the East, if I preface it with a vocabulary of some of the more common words of this language. This I have taken from the larger manuscript\nMalay-Dutch Lexicon compiled at the time at Batavia in Java by M. Leidekker, Minister of the Divine Word, which exhibits more accurately the correct transliteration and meaning of the words than do the works of those authors who have learnt these solely from the pronunciation of the people and not from written texts. The Malay language takes its name from the Malay country, Tana Malaion, the chief town of which is Malacca, which in turn derives its name from the tree malaca or myrobalanus, whence others are accustomed to call this language Malaccic.\n\n[Here follows a vocabulary of Malay words.* Among these the only familiar words to us in Ceylon are:\u2014\n\n| Word   | Meaning                                      |\n|--------|----------------------------------------------|\n| Behasa | language                                     |\n| Behagi | a portion                                    |\n| Boemi  | the earth                                    |\n| Moeka  | the face                                     |\n| Nagara | metropolis                                   |\n| Partama| first                                        |\n| Gaza   | elephant                                     |\n| Oerang | an animal                                    |\n| Toehan | master, lord, which I suppose is the \"Tuan\"  |\n|        | that all Malays expect to be addressed by    |\n| Roetan | which Reland says \"is called by us rotting\" |\n| Razja  | king                                         |\n| Kapala | head which is like the Greek kephal\u00e9, as     |\n|        | Reland notes                                 |\n| Manusja| man                                          |\n| Pagar  | a rampart, palisade, \"whence our een pagger\" |\n| Praho  | a ship, \"whence our people have manu-         |\n|        | factured een praauw\"                         |\n\n* Reland derives \"Bengala\" from \"Penggalan\" = emporium.]\n\nII.\u2014How it is proposed to treat of the remaining Languages.\n\nHaving said this much concerning the Malay language, which is common to many Eastern islands, I now turn to others. It is by no means my intention to give in this place complete grammars and lexicons of those languages of which I shall treat, but merely to give the reader some specimens of those characters which these people make use of when\n\n* In the Javanese vocabulary he gives campong, villa, pagus, tr\u00e6dium.\nthey write, so that if he happens to meet with them in letters or manuscript treatises he may be able to distinguish them; as well as of the more common words, from which he will be able to form a judgment as to the points of agreement between those languages and others, and concerning the origin of those peoples themselves, which are frequently detected from the affinity of their languages with those of others.\n\nNor does the curiosity of most people as a rule extend further than this. Having no idea of themselves ever visiting these islands, they take little trouble to make themselves acquainted with the languages of their inhabitants or to study their literature, and so are not much concerned about the grammars or lexicons of these languages.\n\nI do not, however, condemn them for this; on the contrary, I consider that they spend their time well if by reading books written in their own or some familiar tongue they imbibe ideas useful to themselves or to others. Nevertheless, I do not think it can be unpleasing to them to have some knowledge of the characters in which documents which from time to time come into their hands are written, or of such words as may help by comparison of them with others, in tracing back the origin of these peoples to neighbouring peoples, or in explaining many names of Eastern cities and rivers which are incorrectly given in maps because they were imperfectly understood by the compilers, and have thus been the cause of disputes which would be received with much laughter if they ever came to the ears of the Asiatic races.\n\nNeither is this alien to the functions which I discharge in this Academy,* while it tends to a richer knowledge of the Oriental languages, which are mutually connected together by so close a bond of relationship, that it may be said with some show of reason that for a perfect, and in all ways absolute, knowledge of one Oriental language is required not merely an acquaintance with one of them, but with more than one, in fact, with all of them as far as possible.\n\n*This Academy,\u201d i.e., the University of Leyden.\n| Consonantes | Vocales |\n|-------------|---------|\n| ba          | a       |\n| bha         | aa      |\n| ma          | i       |\n| ja          | ii      |\n| ra          | u       |\n| la          | uu      |\n| wa          | iru     |\n| fa          | irui    |\n| da          | ilu     |\n| dha         | ilui    |\n| tha         | e       |\n| tha         | ay      |\n| da          | o       |\n| dha         | au      |\n\n**ALPHABETUM SINGALAEUM**\n\n*Consonantiae vocalibus cum Congenis, uti cum PA.*\nIII.\u2014Of the Singalese Language.\n\nOf the Asiatic islands of which I shall treat, the one nearest to us is that which is called \"Selan\" by its inhabitants and by its neighbours, and generally \"Ceylon\" by us. The language itself is called \"Singalese,\" because the people name themselves \"Singalae,\" i.e., lions. The writing which they use is widely different from the others which I have been describing, and imitates the manner of the Europeans, and of their nearest neighbours, the Malabars, the lines running from the left to the right. The letters are forty-eight in number, of which five are short vowels, A I U (or the Greek \u03bf\u03c5, for here U ought to be so pronounced) E O, and five long vowels AA, II, UU, AY, AU. To these vowels must also be added four others expressed by IRU, IRUU, ILU, and ILUU, arranged by the Singalese in their alphabet intermediate between the other vowels. Some (scholars), however, express these four sounds by IRI\u00c8, IRIE, ILI\u00c8, ILIE, as for instance the Rev. J. Cronenburg,* himself educated in Ceylon, in his Singalese alphabet which, with a Singalese vocabulary, he published some years ago on my account, and he noted with reference to these letters that their power could not be exactly expressed.\n\nThe table opposite\u2020 shows the forms both of the vowels\n\n* Valentyn (vol. I., pp. 415, 416) mentions a Conradus Cronenburg, who was a predikant in Ceylon from 1692 to 1700.\u2014D. W. F.\n\nSee also \"An account of the Dutch Church in Ceylon\" in Journal of the R.A.S., C.B., for 1848, p. 45, where a Rev. Mr. Cronenberg is mentioned as having returned to Holland in 1700.\n\n\u2020 In this table the author represents the dentals \u03c9, \u1e0d, \u1e5b, and \u1e37 by ta, tha, da, and dha, and the linguals \u1e0d, \u1e5b, \u1e37, and \u1e37 by these letters, with the addition of a line across the upper part of the consonant, or in other words, he uses an intersecting line above instead of a dot below to distinguish the linguals from the dentals. Strange to say e long and o long and the \"bleating\" vowels \u1d57 and \u1d58 are omitted altogether, so that only fourteen vowel sounds are given instead of eighteen, the recognized number at the present day. The number of consonants, however, is correct, thirty-four. The half nasals \u1d9c, &c., and the guttural \u1d9c are also omitted. This alphabet agrees with that given by Ru\u00ebll, who also states that there are forty-eight letters in Sighalese, fourteen of which are vowels and thirty-four consonants, the long e and long o being omitted.\nand consonants and their pronunciation. The eleventh and three following consonants* are expressed by T and D, but intersected by two lines\u2020 to distinguish them from the 16th, 17th, 18th, and 19th letters,\u2021 to pronounce which correctly the tongue must be moved to the palate.\n\nI shall add nothing about the declensions of the nouns, except that the cases are distinguished by certain letters added to their terminations, thus:\n\n| Appa | Appataa | Appee |\n|------|---------|-------|\n| Appagee | Appawaa | Appaagen |\n\nand so in the plural\u2014\n\n| Appaawaaru | Appaawarunda | Appaawarunnee |\n|------------|--------------|---------------|\n| Appaawarunnee | Appaawarunwa | Appaawarunnen\u00a7 |\n\nAs for conjugations, of which they have four, they give more difficulty, since the word itself does not remain unchanged as among the Malays . . . || but in addition to the prefixing of pronouns the word is changed in its last syllables: thus Kianjai, \u201cI shall say\u201d; Kijandoeoenu, \u201cyou will say\u201d; Kianjanu, \u201cwe shall say\u201d; Kieandojoelaanu, \u201cyou or they will say.\u201d\n\nThose who care about these letters will see all these things set forth with the greatest accuracy in the Singalese grammar shortly to be published for the public of Amsterdam, and compiled for the use of our Colonies in the Island of Ceylon.\u00b6\n\n---\n\n* I.e., the linguals.\n\n\u2020 This is a mistake. If the plate is closely examined it will be seen that only one line is really used. The other line is the cross of the t, and is not shown in the d, which has only one line in each case, while the t has two. Ru\u00ebll adopts the same.\n\n\u2021 I.e., the dentals.\n\n\u00a7 The long vowels both of Sinhalese and Tamil are represented by doubling the letter, thus \u00e1 is represented by aa, \u00f3 by oo, &c. Ru\u00ebll does the same. No doubt this accounts for such names as Ilangak\u00f3n being spelt Ilangkoon, Mann\u00e1r by Manaar. Reland here uses ee for the long e, which he omits in the alphabet.\n\n|| Here follow some examples from Malay.\n\n\u00b6 This no doubt refers to Ru\u00ebll\u2019s \u201cGrammar of the Sinhalese Language,\u201d which was published at Amsterdam in the same year that the \u201cDissertationes\u201d came out. Johannes Ru\u00ebll was Rector of the Sinhalese Seminary at Colombo.\nIV.\u2014Vocabulary of Singalese Words.\n\nBut that you may have some Singalese words too, I subjoin a small vocabulary:\n\nTable of Singalese Words.\n\nSinga ... ... lion\nDewijoo ... ... God\nManuspajaa ... ... man (homo). Minihaa is also used\nPirimijaa ... ... man (vir.)\nIstrii ... ... woman\nAppa ... ... father\nAswajaa ... ... horse\nNuwara ... ... city, hence Oudanour, the high town; Tattanour, the low town; and many names which this word helps to explain\n\nAhasa ... ... sky\nIra ... ... sun\nHanda ... ... moon\nRatha ... ... earth, field\nKadhuwaa ... ... sword\nKaludewaa ... ... ass\nRadsjurowaa ... ... king (Razja also used)\nAadmaja ... ... soul\nSangiippuwa ... ... honour\nWala ... ... valley. Hence from the word \"Ponahoy\" is composed the word \"Walaponahoy,\" which is the name of a district situated in the middle of the island, so called from fifty hollows or valleys\n\nRahasa ... ... a secret\nPallije ... ... school\nOegoera ... ... drop\nMama ... ...

Ee, he\nKoi ... ... which?\nAree ... ... that (iste)\nJamkenek ... ... any one\nKoikeneewat ... ... whosoever\nIt is to be observed that the persons are expressed in two or three different ways, in order of the importance of the personages addressed. Thus, *too* and *uu* signify the person (spoken of) when the talk is of slaves or persons of low condition. *Umba*, thou, and *Undoeoe*, he, are fitting when used by the elder addressing the younger, a father a son; and *Tamunwahansa*, thou, and *Ohuwahansa*, he, are used by the younger in addressing or speaking of an older person. So also in the Malay language, when I address persons of the same dignity as myself I say *Beta*, when I speak to persons of lower rank *Ako*, when I speak of myself in the presence of the king I say *Patek* or *Hamba*, which denotes a servant, or *thar Manusiya.* I speak of myself as \u201cthe keeper of the king\u2019s dog.\u201d In the same way *thou* and *he* are expressed in different ways.\n\n| Phrase          | Meaning                  |\n|-----------------|--------------------------|\n| Wahunaw         | it is raining            |\n| Mama karanja    | I write.\u2020                |\n| Mama lijanja    | I make (see note on preceding) |\n| Mama janjaji    | I go                     |\n| Mama injaji     | I sit                    |\n| Mama adahaganja | I believe                |\n| Mama kijanjai   | I speak                  |\n| Mama bandinjai  | I bind                   |\n| Mama woedenjai  | I fall                   |\n| Mama moerunkanja| I am killed              |\n| Mama enjai      | I come                   |\n| Mama aam        | I have come              |\n| Mama issara-aam | I shall have come        |\n| Mama em         | I will come (future)     |\n| Too wara        | come thou                |\n| Uu aawawee      | let him come (veniat ille) |\n| Cola            | leaf, hence the tree Colombo, and the city commonly called Columbo \u2021 |\n\n* In Malay characters.\n\u2020 The author has transposed the meanings of this and the next word. This should be \u201cI write.\u201d\n\u2021 This is incorrect, of course. The derivation usually accepted nowadays is from *Kolamba*, a sea port, but this does not explain how the villages of Kolambagama in the Tissawa K\u00f3ral\u00e9 of the Dewamada Hatpattu of the Kurun\u00e9gala District, and of Kolumbugama in the Me\u0111a Pattuwa of the Nawadun K\u00f3ral\u00e9 of Ratnapura District, neither of which is near the sea, obtained their names. Sirr says: \u201cTradition declares that Calamba\nConde ... mountains, hence the royal city situated in the hills is called Candi, which is shown in the annexed map of this island\n\nOuda ... high\nCorunda ... cinnamon\nGauha ... tree\nWeijs* ... river\nPonahoy ... fifty\nTun ... three\nAngul ... finger\nVehar ... a temple of the chief god Buddoe, whom Clement of Alexandria has noted (Strom., lib.

See Knox's Description of Ceylon, Part IV., chapter 3, and Baldaeus' Descriptio Orae Malabaricae, p. 153\n\nV.\u2014Similar Words in Singalese and Malay.\n\nI have discovered in this Vocabulary some words which are common to this and to the Malay language, as Singa, lion, whence the name itself of the Singalese, which is Singa, lion, with which agrees the Brahmin (Brachmanum) Seng, which means the same; Manuspajaa, man, in Malay Manuschja, man, whence gamb\u00e1la anging raja,\u2020 a place inhabited by men; Kaludewaa, ass, Malay Kalidi; but since that sound comes from a Malabar origin, and many other Singalese word-sounds also spring from the Malabars, who are near neighbours of the Singalese, it is rather to be\n\n(sic) derived its name from a grove of mango trees, called also Colamba in Sinhalese [properly Kolombiya\u2014J.P.L.]; but in one of the most ancient native works extant we read that Calamba signifies a sea port and a fortified place........it is quite certain that the Portuguese conquerors corrupted or changed the name from Calamba to Colombo in honour of their celebrated navigator Columbus\u201d (p. 41).\n\n* For oya. Knox gives weya.\n\u2020 Given in Malay characters.\nassigned to that tongue, *Razja*, king, Malay *Razja*; *Istrii*, wife, Malay *Isterii*,* the same.\n\nSome words agree with the Persian, as *Aswajaa*, horse, *Asp*; *Rahasa*, a secret, *Raz* = secret in the Chaldee tongue; *Bandinjai*, I bind, *Band*; *Dewijan*, God, Persian *Div*, a deity.*\n\nVI.\u2014Of the Malabar Language spoken in Ceylon.\n\nBut I conceive that before I leave this island I must say something of the Malabar language. For a great part of this island is inhabited by the Malabars, which part is commonly called after the name of the Prince who rules over them (*Coilat Wanea*), and the extent of which can be seen in the annexed map.\u2020 These are not subject to the Singalese King nor to us, who possess nearly all the country along the seaborde of this island, but to their own Prince. Besides, the greater part of the inhabitants of the maritime districts use the Malabar tongue; so that from the town of Negombo to near about Dondere the use of the Singalese language prevails, but in the district of Jaffnapatam and in the remaining districts situated along the shore which are nearer to the continent the Malabar tongue is spoken.\n\nBy this means Malabar names have been given to certain places; as for instance to the island of Manaar, from *Man* \u201csand,\u201d and *aar* \u201criver\u201d (as the most learned Baldaeus has observed in his *Description of the Island of Ceylon*, p. 150);\u2021 *Caredive* from *Dive*, an island, whence the name of this island *Selan Div* and *Serendib*, and as *Nindundiva*, long island. So also many names of places which end in *ture*, which means harbour in Malabar, as *Ourature*, *Paretiture*, *Colomboture*, *Corengoture*, *Caleture*; to which add those that end in *Patam* or *Patnam*, which denotes city, emporium, in Malabar, as *Jaffnapatam*.\n\n* These words are of course from the Sanskrit.\n\u2020 This is a copy on the same scale of the map published in Knox\u2019s book.\n\u2021 I suppose Baldaeus is responsible for fathering this error, which still has vitality, as for instance in Mr. Boake\u2019s *Monograph on Manj\u00e4r*, p. 1. See *Ceylon Literary Register*, IV., pp. 303, 322, 359.\nVII.\u2014On the Malabar Characters.\n\nMoreover, the Malabar language, which is written from left to right in our manner, has fourteen vowels.* These are used, just as among the Singalese, only at the beginning of the words, for at the end and in the middle other letters which take the place of vowels are joined to the consonants, as will be clearly seen from the Malabar alphabet which we have added in copper plate. The consonants are eighteen in number, and if one compares their shape with the Singalese character he will see that they agree in many ways, but that the former rather follow a square form such as is found in the Hebrew characters of the Sacred Codex, and that the latter are really round and drawn out into elegant and somewhat artificial forms. The names of the vowels as well as of the consonants are expressed in nearly the same method by the Malabars as by the Singalese, since both races add to the sound of the letters a similar termination. Thus, the Singalese call the vowel a, ajeno\u00eb; i, ijeno\u00eb; o, ojeno\u00eb; and to the consonants they add aino\u00eb, saying when they wish to indicate the first consonant k, kaino\u00eb; so g, gaino\u00eb; ng, ngaino\u00eb, and so on. The Malabars form the names of the vowels by adding the termination na (not jeno\u00eb as the Singalese do), calling the first vowel a, ana\u00eb; i, ina\u00eb; o, ona\u00eb. To the consonants they add ana\u00eb, saying kana\u00eb, nghana\u00eb, chana\u00eb. Whence the affinity of the two languages makes itself manifest in this respect, for in other respects there is a great difference, not only in the sound, but in the declensions and conjugations. If any one wishes to pursue the subject further let him not merely have recourse to the works which Caspar d\u2019Aguilar has put forth concerning this language,\u2020 which are seldom met with, but let him\n\n* This is two more than Pope gives, one being ai, which he gives twice over, i.e., for each character by which it is represented, and the other aytham \u1e63o, which Pope gives as confined to poetry. Reland transliterates it by ae.\n\n\u2020 These works are not mentioned in the list of Tamil grammars given in the introduction to Pope\u2019s Tamil Handbook.\nconsult Baldaeus' Description of the Malabar Coast, which comprises the rudiments of the language, and an immense work in twelve volumes compiled by that illustrious man, the late Henry Hadrian van Reede, a member of the Order of Knighthood of this State. The title of this book is Hortus Malabaricus, and in it the names of trees and herbs are expressed, not only in Arabic and Brahmin or Sanscrit characters, but also in Malabar. Here any one can exercise himself not only in the reading of the Malabar characters, but he can also pick out the proper name of plants and some other names which are explained in the description, such as\u2014\n\n| Nir, water | Kal, stone |\n| Mara, tree | Malan, mountain |\n| Pou, flower | Ponna, gold |\n| Kelengou, root | Valli, ivy |\n| Para, branch | Veluta and ven, white |\n| Nella, good | Schovanna, red |\n| Vara, bad | Inschi, hot, burning |\n| Welli, great | Katu, a wood |\n| Cit, small | Neja, serpent |\n\nand more which help in the composition of the names given to the plants.\n\nVIII.\u2014Of the difference between the Malay and Malabar Languages.\n\nWhat we have noted concerning the Malabar language sufficiently shows that it is not one with the Malay language of which I have treated in section I.\n\nNeither the form of the letters nor the sounds, nor their significations agree, nor are they spoken in the same places. In fact there is nothing calculated to persuade any one that the Malabar and Malay tongues are one and the same, unless it be a certain similarity between the names Malabar and Malay. Nevertheless they are distinct regions, Malabar in the Indian peninsula on this side of the Ganges, and Malais or the Malacca country in the Indian peninsula beyond the Ganges, which, in the most accurate map of the kingdom of Siam and of the neighbouring countries lately published by the\nJesuit Mathematicians of the King of France who were sent there, is called Malaie or Malaios. But because Malabar is also called by some the Male country, some have thought from that that the name Malay was derived from it. So Cosmas Indicopleustes, who lived in the sixth century, and whose works have been edited by that most learned man to whom literature owes so much, Bernard de Montfaucon, calls it \"the place that is called Male, where the pepper grows.\" The author also, who is known by the name of \"the Nubian Geographer,\"* seems to call the same region Meli or Mali (Part VII., chap. II.), although he describes it as an island situated in the sea and distant three miles from the city of Sandan (for if he had merely spoken of it as an island this might, according to the usage of the Arabic language, be understood as referring to a peninsula such as is the Malabar country), as those persons are often mistaken in their description of remote places. \"The island of Melai is that in which pepper grows, which has its origin nowhere else than here and in Candana and Zjarebtan.\" And the Malabar country is that which is chiefly celebrated on account of the production of pepper, and it was therefore commonly called by the Arabs \"the pepper country.\"\n\n* This is the Arabian Geographer Edrisi, or Idrisi, who is thus referred to by Tennent (3rd edition, vol. I., p. 597):\u2014\"Of the Arabian authors of the middle ages the one who dwells most largely on Ceylon is Edrisi, born of a family who ruled over Malaya after the fall of the Khalifs of Cordova. He was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the Sicilian King Roger the Norman, at whose desire he compiled his Geography, A.D. 1154,\" which Tennent describes as \"a Compendium of Geographical knowledge as it existed in his time\" (loc. cit., p. 448). Reland calls him \"the Nubian Geographer\" from the title of his book, or at least of the Latin edition of it.\n\nI am indebted to Mr. D. W. Ferguson for the following transcript of the title from the British Museum Library Catalogue:\n\n\"Geographia Nubiensis, id est accuratissima totius orbis in septem climata divisi descriptio, continens praesertim exactam universae Asi\u00e6, et Africae ....explanationem. [An abridgment of Al Idrisis Nuzhat Al Mushtak.] Recens en Arabico in Latinum versa a Gabriell Sionita ...... et Joanne Hessonita (De nonnullis Orientalium urbisbus, necnon indigenarum religione ac moribus tractatus ...... a Gabr. Sionita ...... ac Joanne Hessonita, etc.). 2, pt. H. Blagaart : Parisiis, 1619.\n\n\"The translation used by Tennent was a French one, by Jaubert.\"\nThis brings to one's mind also the city of Melai on the island Alcomir, one of the Maldives, which is known to us as Male. It is in this way that a confusion of Malabar with Malay has arisen, although they are different peoples and languages. For not even does that most accomplished Oriental scholar B. Herbelotus, in his Bibliotheca Orientalis, distinguish them, writing thus: \"Malai.\u2014Oriental geographers understand by this name that part of India commonly called by us the Malabar country. Nevertheless the name Malabar is sometimes found in their books as if you should say the Malay country. We also at the present day call the inhabitants of this country the Malay, and their tongue the Malay tongue (les Malais et leur langue la langue Malaise).\" Here that most learned man was mistaken. The language of the Malabar country is called Malabar, and the language of the kingdom of Malacca is called Malay; the two languages are quite different.\n\nMr. C. Fernando remarked that the writer of the Paper read (Reland) did not seem to display that Oriental research which might be expected from a Doctor of Philosophy. His treatment of Sinhalese was excelled even by Knox. He had occasion to speak to a Malay gentleman on the subject, who assured him that he was unable to recognize some of the words represented in the work as Malay. He did not deem Reland's efforts valuable nor important from a philological point of view.\n\n7. The following Paper was read by the author:\u2014\nNOTE ON THE FORTIFICATIONS OF Y\u00c1PAHUWA.\n\nBy J. Harward.\n\nThe ruins of Y\u00e1pahuwa have been described with some fulness in a Paper in Once a Week (August, 1864); in a Sessional Paper (LI., 1886) by Mr. A. E. Williams, and more recently in a Paper by Mr. F. H. Modder, published in this Society's Journal (No. 44, 1893). These descriptions, while they do ample justice to the remains of the M\u00e1lig\u00e1wa, give no adequate idea of the outline of the city itself and its fortifications.\n\nI contribute this brief note on the subject in the hope that it may lead to the Archaeological Commissioner some day making an accurate examination of an interesting site.\n\nY\u00e1pahuwa, though not very extensive, is the best specimen that I have seen of a Sinhalese fortified city. The rock of Y\u00e1pahuwa is a huge isolated boulder of elliptical shape about 300 ft. high. Its sides are mostly precipitous, but it can be ascended on its south-east face. At this point, on a large ledge, about 106 ft. above the plain, stands the M\u00e1lig\u00e1wa, whose window is so familiar an object in the Colombo Museum, and whose imposing staircase and doorway have been fully described in the Papers before referred to.\n\nOn the level ground at the foot of the south and south-east faces of the rock are two walls in the shape of concentric semicircles: the inner one is a stone wall with a diameter of about 200 yards, the outer one a steep earthwork faced with brick, whose diameter is about 450 yards. The steps of the M\u00e1lig\u00e1wa seem to stand exactly at the middle point of the diameter on which those semicircles are described. These two walls are now overgrown with jungle, but their course can be seen clearly by any one on the steps of the M\u00e1lig\u00e1wa.\nThe inner wall has been a good deal dismantled, and many of the stones removed. Thick scrub renders it impossible to walk all round it; but I examined it at several points, and was assured by the villagers that it was built of stone all the way round. This wall may have been about 8 or 10 ft. high, and was sufficiently thick to form a substantial fortification. The ground enclosed by this wall must have formed the precincts of the royal palace and the temples attached to it.\n\nThe modern p\u0101sala is on the level ground within this inner wall, but its pilima-g\u00e9 is a cave in the face of the rock between the two walls.\n\nThe outer wall, which is still known by the villagers as the ko\u1e6du-bemma, is about 120 yards from the inner one, and the inhabitants of the city doubtless lived in the space between the two, which is now partly occupied by some small paddy fields and partly overgrown with scrub. The wall was a steep earthwork 15 ft. high, faced with bricks; the bricks are large and well made; on the outside of it is a moat about 15 yards wide, in a fair state of preservation.\n\nPrevious writers have referred to this fortification as a bund; this is misleading. Its construction has nothing to do with purposes of irrigation. The small paddy fields inside its slope down towards it, and are irrigated by two diminutive tanks near the inner wall. There is no trace of paddy fields on the outside of it. There can be no doubt that the outer wall and moat are the works referred to in the Mah\u0101wans\u0101:\n\nAfterwards he (Wijaya B\u0101hu) enclosed that city (Subha Pabbata) also with a high wall and moat.\n\nThe wall is overgrown with jungle, but it is still possible to walk all round the moat, except for a short distance near the rock at the eastern side.\n\nThe entrance to the city was by a fine flight of stone steps leading over the earthwork, at a point in the middle of\n\n* LXXXVIII., 77 (English translation, p. 306).\nthe semicircle which seems to be exactly opposite the steps of the M\u00e1lig\u00e1wa, the upper gateway of which can be seen from the top of these steps. This is the first flight of steps described by Mr. Modder in his Paper;* his second and third flights are on the rock itself. But there must have been also a corresponding entrance at the middle point of the inner semicircular wall, and I believe that I found its position; but thorns and red ants rendered a careful inspection of it impossible.\n\nI believe that all the land within the fortifications is temple property. The village of Y\u00e1pahuwalies just outside the fortifications at the eastern corner. From it there is a jungle track southwards, which, according to the villagers, leads direct to Kurun\u00e9gala: it is probably the old means of communication between the two cities.\n\n8.

Read and confirmed Minutes of General Meeting held on November 14, 1896.\n\n2. The Chairman then called on Mr. Harward to read Mr. Bell's Report on Sigiriya, which the Government had placed at the disposal of the Society.*\n\nMr. Harward, before reading Mr. Bell's Paper, made a few introductory remarks on the Rock, which has of late years excited so much interest.\n\nThe present Report, he said, was a continuation of that of last year, prepared by the Archaeological Commissioner on this famous site. The stronghold of Sigiri-gala was first used by Kasyapa I. in order to escape punishment for patricide; and while there the exile converted the Rock into an elaborate royal residence.\n\nMr. Bell's examination of the Rock, as Archaeological Commissioner, was begun in 1895. His first year's exploration resulted in two principal lines of discovery\u2014first, that at the foot of the Rock there was a fortified city; and secondly, that at the top there were, concealed by jungle and long grass, the remains of very considerable buildings which must have been originally used by royalty.\n\nIn 1896 Mr. Bell devoted himself to continuing excavations on the summit, and further clearing and surveying the extensive area of the ancient Sigiri-nuwara; whilst his Head Draughtsman (Mr. D. A. L. Perera) commenced to make facsimile copies of such frescoes as still remain.\n\n3. Mr. Harward then proceeded to read the following Paper:\u2014\n\n* The Report was accompanied by three albums of photographs, a series of composite photographs giving various views of Sigiri-gala, the fresco caves, frescoes, and excavations; facsimile copies in oils of some of the frescoes; and plans of Sigiri-nuwara, &c.\nINTERIM REPORT ON THE OPERATIONS OF THE\nARCH\u00c6OLOGICAL SURVEY AT SIGIRIYA\n(SECOND SEASON), 1896.*\n\nBy H. C. P. BELL, C.C.S., Arch\u00e6ological Commissioner.\n\nPREAMBLE.\n\nAs projected in my Report for 1895, the Arch\u00e6ological Survey re-commenced its second season's operations at Sigiriya in the early days of February last (1896).\n\nThe last north-east monsoon proved somewhat heavy\u2014sufficient to render the minor road from Inamaluwa to Sigiriya practically impassable for loaded carts, and to fill the veva below the Rock to an extent quite unanticipated. Considerable damage to the \"camp\" huts was caused by the rains; and, in addition, the tank encroached on the tenantless \"cooly lines\" (which had been left in charge of a watcher), and washed down a portion.\n\nAll this had to be put right. A small party was, accordingly, despatched in advance to clean up, rebuild, &c., during January.\n\nLABOUR FORCE.\n\nThe main body of labourers\u2014some 80 in all, men and boys (with this year a few women), and, as before, all recruited solely in Anur\u00e1dhapura\u2014started for Sigiriya on February 1, and settled down to regular work within three days.\n\nLater on I was able to supplement this force\u2014double that got together for the start in 1895\u2014by 20 to 30 extra Tamil hands; and by inducing a sprinkling of Sinhalese to work as earth-carriers upon the top of the Rock, in consideration of a higher rate of wage than that paid for jungle-clearing below. For the timid and superstitious\n\n* Forwarded to Government with Arch\u00e6ological Commissioner's letter No. 767 of December 5, 1896.\nSinhalese villager to scale the dread Rock daily was an entirely \"new departure,\" due to final conviction that the Archaeological Survey had effectually routed forever the yakku, or demons, of Sigiri-gala.\n\nAt one time the full strength at work (jungle-fellers excluded) reached 115; but with the vast amount of excavation still to be completed on the summit alone\u2014to say nothing of perhaps as much below the Rock\u2014I should have welcomed four times the number of stragglers who casually sought employment.\n\nAs last year, I personally took charge from the commencement of operations in February until the close of the season's work on May 23, or little short of four months altogether.\n\nWEATHER.\n\nThe weather was fitful in February, with heavy rain at times (on the 14th and the 15th it poured incessantly for eighteen hours): during March and April hot and still.\n\nMay 2 and 3 witnessed the heaviest rainfall, marking the change of the monsoon, and giving place almost at once to the customary wind from the south-west, which steadily increased in force.\n\nDuring the last ten days of our sojourn at Sigiriya it was hardly possible to stand against the fury of the gale\u2014much less to work\u2014at the southern end of the Rock's summit in the teeth of a ceaseless storm of blinding brick-dust.\n\nHEALTH.\n\nThroughout the treacherous month of February (when the thermometer ranged considerably in the twenty-four hours) chest complaints and fever prevailed to such an extent that several coolies deserted. With the advent of March, however, and its dry calm weather, the general health of the force rapidly improved, and continued good\u2014with casual exceptions\u2014until the end.\n\nOne or two stubborn cases of fever and indolent sores had to be sent to Dambulla hospital for skilled treatment.\nFor the second year, I rejoice to state that no casualty whatever occurred.\n\nThose only who know Sigiri-gala, have climbed (not without some misgiving) to the summit, and uttered involuntarily a sigh of relief on reaching the ground again safely, can fully realize the mental \"tenter-hooks\" on which the officer is stretched, who for nearly four months has to be responsible for the safety of a hundred lives, daily risked\u2014not in the ascent and descent of the Rock merely, but upon the summit itself. For, despite every precaution to ensure against ordinary accident, as well as fool-hardy rashness, hair-breadth escapes must inevitably occur.\n\nSummary of Work Done.\n\nOf the work accomplished this year, it is pleasant to record that both in quantity and quality that of 1895 has been surpassed. This satisfactory result was brought about by the more favourable conditions which governed generally\u2014the distinct advantage of a large labour force\u2014and, not least, by the valuable experience gained in 1895 of the nature of the work to be grappled with.\n\nLast year we were groping our way, with little or nothing to guide us as to the extent and position of the many stone-banked terraces, rock sites, pokunu (ponds), &c., lying within the confines of the ancient city, then completely buried in forest; nor regarding the plan and description of ruins to be excavated. The majority of the hands were raw, unaccustomed to the wild surroundings, and ill-satisfied: food was bad and dear; water scarce and forbidding.\n\nThis season the outlook bore a rosier hue. Almost to a man the same coolies re-accompanied me to Sigiriya\u2014some even brought their wives, and induced relatives and friends to join in the venture. As regards the work, we had with a year's experience fairly got\u2014to use an expressive colloquialism\u2014\"the hang of the thing,\" and started afresh without the uncertainty which hampered us in 1895. The food supply was both ample and good; Sigiriya tank was\nfull; and on the Rock's summit the cistern (dug out by the Archaeological Survey last year) furnished excellent drinking water during working hours for the whole four months. In addition to rice advances obtainable on contract rate at Kimbissa (only two miles off), vegetables could be bought cheaply in the neighbouring villages; and, lastly, pay ruled a fanam higher on the average than at Anur\u00e1dhapura. With no legitimate ground of grievance, therefore, the coolies set themselves to work with a zest which commanded success.\n\nThe bambaru, or rock bees, whose unprovoked attacks so seriously interfered with work for a time in 1895, this year gave us no real trouble. A few swarms arrived late in February; but being very warmly received with \"fireworks\" left the Rock incontinently, or sought the harmless seclusion of the caves and ledges of its eastern cliff.\n\nThe one great trial\u2014how great nobody who has not experienced it can grasp\u2014was, and will always be, the terrible exposure to the tropical sun on the summit of Sigiri-gala. Save for the three or four trees still standing, there is no \"shadow\" from the heat on that \"great rock in a weary land.\" To allow the coolies to descend the Rock for a mid-day meal was out of the question: it would have entailed undue waste of time and energy. The working hours were therefore fixed from 6.30 A.M. to 3 P.M. at a stretch\u2014as honest and hard an \"eight-and-a-half-hours'-day\" as could be justly demanded by any taskmaster.\n\nHeads of Work.\n\nIt will be convenient to deal with the season's operations, as in my Report for 1895, specifically under different heads:\n\n(1) Clearing the site of the Ancient City.\n(2) Survey of Sigiri-nuwara.\n(3) Exploration.\n(4) Excavations.\n(5) Copying the Frescoes.\n(6) Miscellaneous.\n(1) CLEARING THE SITE OF THE ANCIENT CITY.\n\nOwing to the abundance of water and the bright crop prospects this year in the Inamaluwa K\u00f3ral\u00e9, local Sinhalese labour did not \"offer\" until late on in April.\n\nIn the end separate gangs, aggregating nearly 180 men and boys, but fluctuating greatly in number from day to day,\u2014thanks to that innate apathy and disregard for the future born of temporary affluence, which characterize the ordinary Sinhalese goiy\u00e1,\u2014were collected from the surrounding villages.\n\nThis village labour was employed in further clearing the forest undergrowth that still covered the greater portion of the once extensive Sigiri-nuwara.\n\nFrom the \"Rough Plan of Sigiri-nuwara\"* it will be seen that the area freed of scrub last year lies between the Rock and the village path from Sigiriya to Talkotte, on the west.\n\nNow the wave of clearing has swept over the mah\u00e1 bemma, or \"great embankment,\"\u2020 which enclosed the ancient city on that side: further curling round the north and south bases of the Rock it has stopped, eastwards, at the path through chenas to Pidur\u00e1-gala.\n\nThe felling and burning of this additional jungle has brought to light two or three important features of the ruins not entered on Mr. Blakesley's survey plan of 1876; noteworthy, a second four-square moated island,\u2021 two gateways through the outer ramp on the north and south-west, and a cluster of pillars, with a fine n\u00e1ga-gala (cobra-stone) carved from quartz, near the Pidur\u00e1-gala path, east of the Rock.\n\n(2) SURVEY OF SIGIRI-NUWARA.\n\nHand in hand with the removal of the thick brushwood a careful theodolite survey of Sigiri-nuwara was commenced, and to a great extent carried out, this year. Great pains\n\n* Reproduced, on a smaller scale.\n\u2020 The natives call this outer ramp \"vil bemma.\"\n\u2021 First discovered in 1895 in the course of my personal wanderings through the thick jungle surrounding the Rock.\nhave been taken to insert every rock (many lined with grooves for the foundations of structures that stood upon them), stone wall, pond, &c.; so that a large scale plan may be ultimately drawn from which no ancient remains above ground shall be omitted.\n\nAll west of the Rock has been already surveyed in detail; whilst round the lowest slopes of Sigiri-gala itself a traverse has been run, the \"gallery\" accurately located, and the line of survey taken past the north-west corner of the Rock, and up the ladders and grooves beyond to the top. The prismatic compass survey made in 1895 of the Rock's summit and the excavations thereon has been checked and improved upon.\n\n(3) Exploration.\n\n(a) Exploration of the elongated hummock of rock situated south of Sigiri Rock, and styled by the natives M\u00e1pa-gala, proves it to have been included within the limits of the ancient city. Huge walls of cyclopean masonry defend this whale-like rock, both on the east and west; and parallel with the western wall occurs a well-defined line of lesser stones, which points to a street or road leading on southwards in days gone by. When the jungle in this quarter has been cut away we shall know more about the connection of M\u00e1pa-gala with the Great Rock.\n\n(b) About a mile from Sigiriya, and only a short distance off the minor road from Inamaluwa, in forest, I was guided to the remains of an ancient Buddhist monastery, which doubtless dates back to the stirring times of the fifth century A.D., when the parricide Kasyapa ruled on Sigiri-gala. Here, thickly overgrown, are monolith pillars and a d\u00e1gaba mound of no mean size, adjoining a small tank.\n\n(c) High up the eastern face of Sigiri Rock may be noticed a dark streak betokening caves.* These I determined to explore.\n\n* Photograph, C 472.\nAn attempt to get into them, by mounting from the rock-cut grooves on the north-east side of the Rock, beyond the present ladders, proved abortive. The grooves (which may have held a short \"gallery\" wall or a battlement simply) end abruptly some distance below the caves.\n\nI then resorted to another expedient, and succeeded: and this is how.\n\nThe Rock scarp below the caves, being nowhere less than 30 degrees in slope, and in places sheer, ascent without the aid of a rope is impossible. A 4-in. hawser was, therefore, let down to the ground over the brow of the caves. Up this stout rope \"swarmed\" half a dozen of the strongest and most sure-headed coolies\u2014it is 294 ft. measured distance, hand over hand pull up the whole way\u2014to the apparent mouth of the caves: apparent only, for the men found themselves still 50 ft. out from, and below, the actual floor, with no means of getting nearer owing to the projecting crag above, and the rope's own weight keeping it taut. Ultimately a brave Siphalese lad with a light rope round his waist (the other end being held by men) crawled, crocodile-fashion, up the remaining steep smooth slope. Once in the caves he noosed the rope to a piece of fallen rock. Next day a strong iron ring was driven into the floor for greater security, and the hawser passed through it.\n\nOn April 21 I made the ascent with my Head Draughtsman, Mr. D. A. L. Perera: only to be grievously disappointed. We had fain to be content with a poor negative gain\u2014the absolute assurance that the caves contained no trace of previous human occupation. Foot of man may never before have desecrated this sanctuary of eagle and falcon.*\n\nThese natural caves, or more correctly this one continuous cavern 197 ft. in length, with a floor width averaging 11 ft., being virtually inaccessible, has to all appearance been left\n\n* Three eggs of the Peregrine Falcon (varying strangely in hue from chocolate to almost white) were secured from under a rock in this cavern. Mr. H. Parker informs me that the eggs of this bird have never before been taken in Ceylon.\n\"from the dark backward and abysm of time\" to bird and bat and mountain bee. No vegetation grows there: a few thin slabs flaked off the granite roof alone break the bare vista into space at either end. Over head the beetling rock, which juts out steeply 40 ft. and more, is strangely \"pitted\" on its under side, and so white with age that from the ground a hundred yards below the whole roof seems coated with weather-worn plaster. Under foot the rock floor is polished and slippery from untold centuries of wear by feet of myriads on myriads of birds.\n\nBefore descending from this gaunt\n\n\"grey cliff of lonely stone, midst sailing bird and silent air,\"\n\nwe measured and made a plan of the cavern, photographed it from north and south,* and deposited in a niche a sealed record of its exploration by the Archaeological Survey in the year of grace 1896.\n\n(4) EXCAVATIONS.\n\nNo excavations were attempted below the Rock this year. For every reason it is desirable to finish once for all the excavation of the ruined citadel, or palace, on the summit of Sigiri-gala, before giving fresh attention to what lies at its foot and further afield.\n\nDigging on the top of the Rock was restarted at the point where work ceased in 1895, i.e., immediately north of the central pokuna, or pond, and east of the high-level area which, broadly speaking, occupies the western half of the summit, bisecting it from north verge to south verge in gradually descending terraces.\n\nLeaving the cleaning out of the pokuna, as most sheltered from the wind, for the last weeks of the season's work, we pushed past it, skirting the Rock's east edge, and so on southwards, until the entire low-level area lying between the pond and the southernmost brink of the rock\u2014besides a small slice of the higher section\u2014was completely excavated.\n\n* Photographs, A 144, 145.\nCompletely, I say, in contradistinction to the unavoidable \"half-measures\" of 1895; when, with fewer hands and less light, mere trenches were dug along walls and steps, and the nett result was but partially satisfactory. Plotted on paper the general plan of the ground dug last year can be fairly well understood; but go to the spot itself, and all seems confusion\u2014indeed, must be confused, so long as the intervening earth and d\u00e9bris are not fully removed.\n\nIn this\u2014our second\u2014season, working with a larger force, and upon the useful experience acquired in 1895, the mistake was not repeated. From the outset the coolies were put to the slow but sure task\u2014galling from its wearisome monotony and inherent delay\u2014of digging out the whole mass of hard-caked brick and earth hiding walls and staircases, down to the original floor level.\n\nThe area excavated this year covers (omitting the pokuna) $3\\frac{1}{2}$ acres and upwards. As the depth of earth-cutting varied from 5 ft. to as much as 20 ft. in places; and as, again, every basket of \"spoil\" had to be carried to the east, or south, edge of the rock and thrown over, the completion of the heavy task before the south-west gale fell on us taxed our powers to the utmost.\n\nBut the ultimate benefit of this wholesale \"sweep\" of the d\u00e9bris, laborious and slow though it be, cannot be exaggerated. Nothing is missed; walls and foundations can be perfectly differentiated; forms of moulding examined properly; above all, thus only can there be got a comprehensive and intelligible view of the trend of walls and cross-walls, and the intercommunication of a perfect labyrinth of stairs and passages.\n\nThe \"Plan of the excavations on the Summit of Sigiri-gala, 1895-96,\"* and the composite photographs,\u2020 best give an idea of the lie of the several terraces and the direction of the stairways descending from the level of the pokuna bund.\n\nNot to burden a provisional Report, such as this, with a load of dry details and measurements, it will suffice to draw\n\n---\n\n* Reproduced.  \n\u2020 C 593\u2013595, 597\u2013602: not reproduced.\nattention to the main lines and features disclosed by this year's excavations.\n\nBriefly, then, that part of the ancient citadel lying south of the pond, and east of the high-level strip, was laid out in a series of cross-terraces, east and west, varying in width\u2014adapted no doubt to the slope of the live rock below\u2014and falling away southwards. From the pokuna to the foot of the last staircase (the longest yet uncovered) at the extreme south are seven or eight distinct terraces. West, as already stated, is higher ground, still hardly scratched by the spade; to the east may have been placed minor rooms; whilst the centre is taken up with an open courtyard and passages leading up to the pond, and round it, on either side, by stairs and intermediate landings\u2014all admirably planned to suit the physical conditions, and displaying marvellous ingenuity in the turning to full account the limited space and surface inequalities of the Rock's summit.\n\nThe chief rooms we hope to uncover next year (1897) on the higher level; for they would naturally be built in the most commanding position.\n\nFive and twenty flights of steps have been exposed this year, and all (as pointed out of the stairs discovered in 1895) of quartz or quartose limestone, except the single set cut in the gneiss rock down the west slope of the pokuna.*\n\nIn digging on the south-east corner of the Rock a second cistern was come upon. The very existence of this artificial gal-wala had been unsuspected, as it lay buried beneath a heavy bank of d\u00e9bris. The cistern is rectangular, measures 16 ft. by 10 ft., and is sunk into the live rock. Less deep\n\n---\n\n* A good view of a series of these staircases, rising in line northwards and hugging the revetment wall of the higher area, is given in photograph C 603.\n\nThe drawing (reproduced) shows well the plan, elevation, and section of another flight of steps (see, too, photographs, C 596, 604). These possess the Anur\u00e1dhapura type of curling balustrades or \"wings,\" helix-finished (to which the hard, highly polished plaster still adheres), and a string-course carried along the wall in the neat \"nail-head\" moulding greatly favoured in these ruins.\n(5 ft.) than its fellow on the west (cleared last year), it will nevertheless serve as a welcome augmentation of our drinking water in 1897.\n\nI also had the mysterious pit, or well, on the high bank near the north edge dug out, in the vague hope that the native tradition regarding a passage into the bowels of Sigiri-gala might possibly here find confirmation. The hope was soon dashed: a natural depression in the Rock's surface at this point had anciently been utilized for no other purpose than an additional cistern, enclosed within thick walls of brick.\n\nFurther, to ascertain the sectional construction of the citadel, a deep trench, cut down to the bare rock, was begun from the southernmost verge, and run some distance northwards. On this subject I may have more to say in a subsequent Report. Meanwhile, it may be noted that the foundations of the brick walls rest on built rubble stone, standing on the Rock matrix.\n\nFinally, digging out and cleaning the large pokuna gave a good deal of trouble.\n\nUndug, the pond had the appearance of a shapeless pool, with ragged sloping sides, due to the collapse of the surrounding brick walls. It contained some 5 ft. of half-stagnant water, so sour from rotting vegetation that even the hardened Tamil coolly shrank from drinking it. As clearing proceeded it became evident that the pokuna, like the smaller cisterns, was rectangular, and of dimensions considerably in excess of anticipation.\n\nFully excavated, it measures about 90 ft. by 68 ft. On the west and north-west the rock core rises steeply, and a deep slice had originally to be cut into it to get a squared corner for the pond, so that each side might be approximately of equal length and parallel. Along the other sides, where the Rock was scooped out to a depth of no more than 3 to 4 ft., a massive brick wall was built as a bund to hold up flood water when the pond was full. Excepting the rock-stair on the west, the only steps down to the pokuna, now apparent, were\nfrom the north. At the south-east corner are the remains of a quartz aqueduct, but too broken to restore. The spreading roots of a fine specimen of *Ficus Tsiela* now fill up the south-west corner.*\n\nAn effort to pump the water out of the pond over the high bund, and to pass it down the east cliff, proved a Sisyphean task\u2014utterly futile. The black, viscous mud of ages choked the draw-pipe, and the borrowed hose split everywhere. With infinite labour of days we reduced the water by a foot and a half: in two nights the rain put as much back! Then, as a last resource, the brick wall was cut through on the south-east down to the rock, and wooden *yotu* (Sinhalese hand-worked scoops) tried\u2014with complete success. These simple and effective implements emptied the pond in a few days. The subsequent removal of mud and d\u00e9bris, with which the *poku\u1e47a* had silted up, occupied some time, owing to the numerous steps and pavement slabs that the wash-away of centuries had deposited at the bottom.\n\nIn the silt nothing of interest was found embedded.\n\nThe *poku\u1e47a*, now scoured and clean, should furnish abundance of pure drinking water for our next season.\n\nThe \"finds\" made this year were hardly less disappointing than those of 1895. Pottery, as before, predominates\u2014half a dozen flower-pots, lamps, fragments innumerable of chatties, dishes, &c.; a little stucco ornament; and iron and copper nails, bolts, &c., *ad libitum*.\n\nAmong the few unusual articles exhumed were the \"toe-cap\" (copper) of a sandal, a small copper bell, a pair of ancient iron scissors, an iron finger-ring, some cornelian beads, flakes of discoloured talc, and three or four \"third-brass\" *oboli* of the later Roman Empire.\u2020 The last are of definite historical interest. Similar coins have been occasionally found at Anur\u0101dhapura and elsewhere throughout\n\n---\n\n* For photographs of the *poku\u1e47a*, see C 367 (under forest growth, 1894); 429, 430 (jungle felled but unburnt, 1895); 614\u201318 (excavated, 1896).\n\n\u2020 Since cleaned sufficiently to read on reverse: *GLORIA ROMANORUM*. Probably coins of Honorius (395\u2013423 A.D.).\nthe Island, and further testify to the world-wide commerce and influence of ancient Rome.\n\n(5) COPYING THE FRESCOES.\n\nA real commencement has at length been made in securing facsimiles in oils of the unique frescoes of Sigiriya, as they exist (with all natural * imperfections) at the present day.\n\nAfter protracted correspondence with the District Engineer, Matal\u00e9, regarding the best means of gaining access to the two \"pockets,\" or small caves, containing the frescoes,\u2014trestle-staging from the \"gallery\" being at first fancied, but finally condemned as too heavy and costly,\u2014a suggestion of the Provincial Engineer, Central Province, was adopted. Mr. R. D. Ormsby proposed a vertical wire ladder, cane-hooped, and securely fastened to iron jumpers above and stout rings below\u2014a mode of ascent theoretically simple, but requiring a firm hold and a sure head. This ladder the Public Works Department could not get into position for some time after the Archaeological Survey commenced work at Sigiriya; and, in consequence, the copying of the frescoes was greatly delayed.\n\nThe wire ladder, as fixed, falls perpendicularly within one foot of the \"gallery\" wall to its floor from the shoulder of the overhanging rock some 40 ft. up. From that point the rock bends inwards for 4 ft. or so to the sloping floor of the larger \"pocket\" \"B\" (38 ft. 4 in. \u00d7 11 ft. 8 in. \u00d7 12 ft. in height). At the left, or north, end of \"B\" is a narrow slanting ledge, only 1 ft. 6 in. wide \u00d7 3 ft. 6 in. high\u2014the sole possible approach to the second and much smaller \"pocket\" \"A\" (20 ft. 9 in. \u00d7 3 ft. \u00d7 6 ft. 8 in.).\n\nAt the head of the ladder, and along the edge of both \"pockets\" and the ledge, iron standards 3 ft. 4 in. in height, with a single top rail, were, at the outset, driven into the Rock as an essential safeguard. Without such\n\n* The serious and unnecessary damage wrought artificially in 1889 (see supra, note \u2020, p. 256) has been ignored by the Archaeological Survey Draughtsman in copying the paintings.\nhandrail a slip on the smooth inclined floor of the \"pocket\" would mean instant death on the rocks fifty yards below.*\n\nMr. Perera was not able to get to work on the frescoes till the last week in March; thereby losing nearly two months of bright fine weather.\n\nAs the result of this year's painting only six, or less than one-third, of the whole set of ancient frescoes still preserved in \"pockets\" \"A\" and \"B\" have so far been finished. If all goes well, with an earlier start\u2014for the unfortunate delay of this year cannot recur\u2014the remainder will be copied in 1897.\n\nI prefer to keep back a full description of the frescoes until I am in a position to deal with them as a whole. A few brief particulars, however, will not be amiss here.\n\nThe frescoes now existing on the west face of Sigiri-gala (save patches of colour here and there) consist in whole, or in part, of twenty-two half-figure portraits\u2014all female: five in \"pocket\" \"A,\" seventeen in \"B.\" The painting dates back to the fifth century A.D. The figures of \"pocket\" \"B\" are more than life size; those of \"A\" smaller than life. They are painted at the back, sides, and on the roof of the \"pockets\" in colours most vivid\u2014red, yellow, and green alone\u2014laid upon a thick coating of specially prepared plaster.\n\nAll the figures are intended to be depicted as moving in the same direction\u2014northwards. Some of the queens, princesses, or court ladies (if such the paintings represent)\u2020 are accompanied by female servants. The latter are of a different race seemingly, for they are painted a darker hue. The flowers held by the ladies and their attendants may signify that they are setting forth to worship at the ancient\n\n* So far but few men, and only one lady (April 24, 1896: photographs, C 622, 623), have cared to risk the perpendicular climb up to \"pocket\" \"B,\" and the still more hazardous crawl along the slippery canted ledge into \"pocket\" \"A.\"\n\n\u2020 The clouds from which the demi-figures are made to emerge may suggest goddesses.\nBuddhist temple on *Pidur\u00e1-gala*, the rocky hill situated a mile to the north of *S\u00edgiri* Rock.\n\nViewed from the ground the fair ladies, as distinguished from their duskier handmaids, would appear to be unclothed above the waist; but a close examination supports the counter-supposition (highly probable on other grounds), in view of the known *penchant* for ultra-diaphanous garments shown by Oriental sculptor and painter alike in by-gone days\u2014a \"strange conceit\" which art works of ancient India too amply illustrate.\n\nThat the hand of time, and the ravages of birds and insects, should have robbed the frescoes of much of their pristine beauty is not surprising. Rather is it matter of wonder that after the lapse of at least 1,400 years any should have survived\u2014and that with a freshness, all things considered, simply marvellous.\n\nIn 1889 Mr. A. Murray, of the Public Works Department, managed to get into the larger \"pocket\" \"B\"; and brought away copies, done in coloured chalks, of thirteen of the seventeen frescoes in that cave, *i.e.*, all except Nos. 14, 15, 16, and the single hand (No. 17), which are painted on the rock wall and roof outside the floor line. These crayon drawings are at this moment hanging in the Colombo Museum.\n\nAs an heroic first attempt to reproduce the frescoes carried out under conditions which rendered full success hopelessly impossible,* Mr. Murray's efforts are beyond praise.\u2020 \"Comparisons\"\u2014have we it not on the authority of the inimitable Dogberry\u2014\"are odorous.\" I desire to make none. That under circumstances more favourable the Archaeological\n\n---\n\n*Season\u2014during June's gale; position\u2014cramped, lying on back or side; material\u2014crayons; time\u2014one week.\n\n\u2020It must always remain a source of deep regret that Mr. Murray should have permitted the tracing paper for his copies to be affixed so clumsily that in removing it the plaster has come away, leaving white-line \"frames\" around\u2014and even across\u2014the figures. Frescoes Nos. 1\u201313 in \"pocket\" \"B\" are thus pitifully disfigured. Photographs C 635\u2013643, taken in 1896, show up the evil markedly.*\nSurvey has been enabled to obtain, for the first time, actual facsimiles of the Sigiriya frescoes\u2014just as they remain after the wear and tear of nearly a decade and a half\u2014need in no degree detract from the individual merit of Mr. Murray\u2019s pioneer work.\n\nThe height of the \u201cpockets\u201d from the ground and the \u201cgallery\u201d prevents a complete view of all the frescoes together being got from any one point, except at such a distance that even a tele-photographic lens failed to bring them reasonably close.\n\nIt was therefore decided to photograph and paint the two fresco caves from mid-air.\n\nThe 4-in. hawser was transferred from the east to the west edge of the summit, the rope lowered to the ground over the cliff (which on this face projects considerably), and a strong iron block bound to the end. Through the block a new 2-in. rope was then passed, and an improvised chair firmly tied on to it: the hawser was then pulled half way up the west scarp; and all was ready.\n\nHauled up, one swung in the air 150 ft. and upwards above the ground, and 50 ft. clear of the cliff.\n\nSwaying in mid-air from the force of the wind, the instantaneous shutter used for photographing worked too slowly, and the pictures were more or less blurred.\n\nOn the other hand, after a week\u2019s \u201crocking\u201d in space, Mr. Perera completed an excellent little oil painting, to scale, of the two fresco \u201cpockets.\u201d This shows at a glance the relative position of the several figures.*\n\nOther photographs* give views of (a) the ladder to \u201cpocket\u201d \u201cB\u201d;\u2020 (b) of both \u201cpockets,\u201d taken from their north and south ends;\u2021 and (c) of the fresco portraits, Nos. 1 to 14.\u00a7\n\n* Exhibited at the Meeting.\n\u2020 C 619, 620, 621. As in 1895, the ladder up to fresco \u201cpocket\u201d \u201cB\u201d was removed at the close of the season\u2019s work.\n\u2021 C 631\u2013634.\n\u00a7 C 635\u2013643.\nMr. Perera's copy in oils of the double-figure frescoes, Nos. 3 and 4 in \"pocket\" \"B,\" is forwarded as a sample of his work.* Ex uno disc\u00e9 omnes. It is hardly going too far to assert that this specimen, as well as the other four copies already made, represent the original frescoes, as they may still be seen at Sigiriya, with a faithfulness almost perfect. Not a line, not a flaw or abrasion, not a shade of colour, but has been patiently reproduced with the minutest accuracy.\u2020\n\nA fresco, hitherto unknown, was discovered this year. This is not, like the rest, on the Great Rock, but in a cave formed beneath one of the boulders which lie behind (west of) the so-called \"Audience Hall.\" Faint indications of colouring under a thick coat of whitewash, when carefully scraped revealed a portion of a viyan-reda, or awning cloth, painted on the rock roof. Such viyan-redi are frequently depicted to this day over recumbent images of the Buddha in vih\u00e1r\u00e9s; and this ancient fresco proves that the cave was used as a Buddhist shrine.\n\nThis fragment\u2014interesting not alone for its chaste design, but for the introduction of black among the three colours solely employed in the \"pocket\" frescoes\u2014has been beautifully copied by Mr. Perera, and is also forwarded with this Report.*\n\n(6) MISCELLANEOUS.\n\nAmong other desirable work done may be noted:\u2014\n\n(a) The delimitation of the area required by the Crown\n\n* Exhibited at the Meeting.\n\u2020 Mr. S. M. Burrows, C.C.S., kindly favours me with the following strong certificate to Mr. Perera's sterling work:\u2014\n\n\"I have much pleasure in stating than when I was at Sigiriya last year (1896) I had an opportunity of comparing, on the spot and in the very cave itself the frescoes with the copies which Mr. Perera has made of them. I cannot speak too highly of the remarkable fidelity with which he has performed his task; the more remarkable considering the position which the frescoes occupy. I think that he deserves the highest praise for his work, and that he has conferred a benefit on Ceylon Archaeology by furnishing such faithful representations of these unique drawings.\"\nfor the permanent conservation of the ruins of Sigiriya-nuwara. The villagers of Sigiriya and Piduragala had extended chena cultivation within the mah\u00e1 b\u00ebmma enclosing the ancient city. Consultation with the Acting Assistant Government Agent, Matal\u00e9 (Mr. S. M. Burrows), and inquiry at the spot, terminated in the following official order:\n\nNo chena\u00efng will be allowed within these boundaries: on the west of the Rock,\u2014the outer b\u00ebmma; on the east of the Rock,\u2014nothing west of the path to Piduragala or within the rectangular b\u00ebmma north of Sigiriya tank.\n\n(b) The District Road Committee spent this year a small sum, much needed, on the improvement of the minor road from Inamaluwa to Sigiriya. There is hope, too, that the present uninhabitable \"Ga\u1e47sabh\u00e1wa bungalow\" at Sigiriya may be supplanted in 1897 by a small serviceable resthouse. At present there is no decent accommodation for visitors desirous of staying the night at Sigiriya.\n\n(c) The dangerous breach in the \"gallery\" wall, between the approach ladder and the first flight of steps, has been built up to the level of the \"gallery\" floor. With another year's neglect this isolated, and most southerly, portion of the wall would have fallen bodily.\n\n(d) Besides copying the frescoes, Mr. Perera made detailed measurements and drawings of this year's excavations,* which will be turned to account in my fuller Annual Report.\n\n(e) The series of Government photographs of Sigiriya has been materially added to this year. Three albums containing the set so far taken accompany this Report.\u2020\n\nIn conclusion, I have merely to report that, subject to the approval of Government, I propose to resume operations at Sigiriya, as before, in February next. With this end a party\n\n* Exposure day after day to the intense glare on the Rock's summit affected Mr. Perera's eyesight so severely that he was ordered complete rest for some weeks.\n\u2020 Exhibited at the Meeting.\nof coolies, under an overseer, has already been sent ahead to construct new \"lines\" (those in use for the past two years having rotted beyond repair), clear the summit, &c., for next season's work.\n\n4. A discussion followed the reading of the Paper, in which the Chairman, and Messrs. Ferguson, Cull, and Harward took part.\n\n5. Mr. Ferguson said he had much pleasure in proposing a cordial vote of thanks to H. E. the Governor for graciously consenting to spare Mr. Bell's Report to the Society, as well as to Mr. Bell himself for the important Paper just read, and the pains he had taken to interest and enlighten the Meeting by the rich display of drawings, photographs, and paintings in illustration of it.\n\nMr. C. M. Fernando seconded, and, in doing so, said that he was of the same opinion as last year, viz., that in the Buddhist caves in the Deccan there were frescoes of a similar type to, and contemporaneous with, those at Sigiriya, relating to Ceylon history. From that he deduced that it was not Indian artists who came here, but Sinhalese who went over there. He made the statement on the authority of Sir Emerson Tennent, who declared that the first discovery of painting in oils was made by the Sinhalese.\n\nWith regard to the Roman coins\u2014of which mention had been made in the Paper\u2014it was not a matter of great surprise, because there was certainly communication between the Court of Rome and that of Ceylon in ancient times; and it was a well known fact in history that an Embassy headed by an Arachchi had visited Rome and been received by the Emperor Claudius.\n\nThe motion was carried unanimously.\n\n6. The Meeting concluded with a vote of thanks to the Chair.\n\n30 AUG. 98\n", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-03", "created": "2025-10-03", "metadata": {"Source-File":
