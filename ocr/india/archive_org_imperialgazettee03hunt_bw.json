W. H.\nBirbh\u00fam (Beerbhoom).\u2014District of the Bardw\u00e1n Division, in the Lieutenant-Governorship of Bengal, lying between $23^\\circ 34'$ and $24^\\circ 35'$ N. lat., and between $87^\\circ 7' 30''$ and $88^\\circ 4' 15''$ E. long.; area, 1756 square miles; population, according to the Census of 1881, 794,428 souls. It is bounded on the north-west by the Sant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s; on the east by the Districts of Murshid\u00e1b\u00e1d and Bardw\u00e1n; and on the south by Bardw\u00e1n District, the Aj\u00e1i river forming the boundary line for the whole distance. The District takes its name, according to the Sanskrit etymologists, from Vir-Bh\u00fami, 'hero-land;' but the Sant\u00e1li word Vir, meaning jungle, has also been suggested as its derivation. The administrative head-quarters of the District are at Suri town.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The eastern portion of the District is an alluvial plain, presenting the ordinary features of the Bengal lowlands; towards the west the ground rises, the surface consisting of undulating beds of laterite, which rest on a basis of rock. Granitic veins traverse the District in parts, occasionally appearing on the surface. About 15 miles south-west of the Civil Station of Suri, there is a curious mass of granite, rising to a height of 30 or 40 feet, split up into numerous irregular fragments by the action of sun and rain. No navigable river flows through Birbh\u00fam; the largest stream is the Aj\u00e1i, which forms the southern boundary line of the District. The other streams deserving notice are the Mor or Maureksha, the Bakeswar, the Hingl\u00e1, and the Dwark\u00e1. The Mor, which flows in a wide sandy bed, is navigable during the rains, but by descending boats only. Small canoes are built on the banks, and floated down during the freshets; they carry charcoal to Katw\u00e1, where they are sold with their cargoes, as they cannot be taken up stream again. There are no lakes or canals in the District.\nOn the bank of the Bakeswar n\u00e1la, about a mile south of the village of T\u00e1ntipar\u00e1, occurs a group of sulphur springs, named the Bh\u00fam Bakeswar, and numerous hot jets also burst forth in the bed of the stream itself. This spot is a noted place of pilgrimage, and the right bank of the stream is covered with temples erected by pilgrims in honour of Mah\u00e1deo or Siva. Another warm spring breaks out near the village of Sakarakunda. Iron and limestone are the only minerals of any importance found in the District. Iron-ores have long been worked under the rough native mode of smelting; and within recent years an attempt has been made to ascertain whether more extended operations might not profitably be carried out according to the European process of manufacture. The larger kinds of wild beasts, which formerly infested B\u00edrbh\u00fam, have now almost disappeared, with the exception of an occasional tiger or bear which wanders into the cultivated tracts from the jungles of the Sant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s on the west. Small game, such as hares, partridges, wild duck, quail, and snipe, are common.\n\nHistory.\u2014The area of the District is at present much more limited than in former times. When it first came under British administration, the B\u00edrbh\u00fam zam\u00ednd\u00e1ri occupied an area of 3858 square miles; and the District included in addition the zam\u00ednd\u00e1ri of Bishnupur, which was in the beginning of the present century separated and formed into the independent Collectorate of B\u00e1nkur\u00e1. Some years later, reductions were made in the remaining portion of B\u00edrbh\u00fam District, by the separation from it of considerable tracts on the west, which now form part of the Sant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s. Finally, within the last few years, in order to make the different jurisdictions conterminous, further transfers of small tracts have been made to and from the District, the present (1883) area of the District being 1756 square miles.\n\nIn the beginning of the 18th century, the zam\u00ednd\u00e1ri of B\u00edrbh\u00fam was conferred by Jafar Kh\u00e1n on one Asad-ull\u00e1 Path\u00e1n, whose family had settled in the country a century earlier, after the fall of the Pathan dynasty of Bengal. The estate remained in the family until the British obtained, in 1765, the financial administration of Bengal. It was not till 1787, however, that the Company assumed the direct government of B\u00edrbh\u00fam. Before that year, the local authority was suffered to remain in the hands of the R\u00e1j\u00e1. Meanwhile, bands of marauders from the western highlands, after making frequent predatory incursions, had established themselves in the District. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 could do nothing against these invaders, who formed large permanent camps in strong positions, intercepted the revenues on the way to the treasury, brought the commercial operations of the Company to a stand-still, and caused many of the factories to be abandoned. It became absolutely necessary for the English Government to interfere; and the first step in that direction was taken in 1787, when the two border principalities of\nBirbh\u00fcm and B\u00e1nkur\u00e1 were united into one District, a considerable armed force being maintained to repress the bands of plunderers on the western frontier. On one occasion, in 1788, the Collector had to call out the troops against a band of marauders five hundred strong, who had made a descent on a market town within two hours' ride of the English station, and murdered or frightened away the inhabitants of between thirty and forty villages.\n\nIn the beginning of the following year (1789), the inroads assumed even more serious proportions, the plunderers going about sacking villages 'in parties of three or four hundred men, well-found in arms.' The population was panic-stricken, the large villages and trading dep\u00f4ts were abandoned, and the Collector was compelled hastily to recall the outposts stationed at the frontier passes, to levy a militia supplementing the regular troops, and obtain reinforcements of soldiery from the neighbouring Districts. The marauders could not hold out against the forces thus brought against them, and were driven back into the mountains. Order was soon established, and the country recovered with amazing rapidity from the disastrous effects of the ravages to which it had been exposed. The neglected fields were cultivated once more; the inhabitants returned to the deserted villages; and the people, reassured by the success of the measures taken by the Government, eagerly joined them against the marauders. In the beginning of the present century, the District was reported to be remarkably free from robbery; and so completely have the troublous times through which it passed faded from local memory, that, a few years ago, the District was described in a public document as still enjoying 'its old immunity from crime.' The District is now as peaceful as any in Bengal, and the administrative statistics, which will be found below, furnish an eloquent commentary on the results of British rule in Birbh\u00fcm.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The population of the District in 1872, as returned by the Census of that year, but allowing for all transfers to and from the District since then, was 853,785. The Census of 1881 returned a total population of 794,428, being a decrease of 59,357, or 6\u00b795 per cent. on the area of the District as at present constituted, namely, 1756 square miles. This decrease is due to the ravages of the 'Bardwan fever,' which has been devastating the Division since 1861. Average density of population (1881) 452\u00b740 per square mile; number of towns or villages, 3273; number of occupied houses, 181,068; unoccupied houses, 18,932; number of villages per square mile, 1\u00b786; number of houses per square mile, 113\u00b790; number of persons per occupied house, 4\u00b739. Divided according to sex, the males numbered 381,563, and the females 412,865; proportion of males, 48\u00b70 per cent. This disproportion of the sexes, which is noticeable\nin every District of the Bardw\u00e1n Division, is owing to its proximity to Calcutta; many men go there in search of employment, leaving their wives and families behind. Classified according to religion, the Hindus predominate largely, numbering 617,310, or 77.70 per cent. of the population; the Muhammadans were returned at 162,621, or 20.47 per cent.; Christians, 48; and 'others,' consisting mainly of aboriginal tribes who still retain their primitive forms of faith, 14,449, or 1.82 per cent. Of the highest and respectable castes of Hindus, Br\u00e1hmans numbered 39,724; R\u00e1jputs, 8344; K\u00e1yasths, 8902; and Baniy\u00e1s, 18,103. Of the S\u00fadra castes, the most important are the Sadgops, the chief cultivating class, numbering 79,621. The other most numerous castes are the following:\u2014K\u00e1lu, 20,783; Bagd\u00ed, 40,032; Cham\u00e1r, 30,975; Dom, 35,316; Baur\u00ed, 27,258; and Har\u00ed, 23,286, who form the lowest classes of the Hindu social organization. The Muhammadans are divided according to sect into\u2014Sunn\u00eds, 157,316; Shi\u00e1s, 3565; and unspecified, 1740. Of the 48 Christians, 29 were native converts. The population of B\u00edrbh\u00fam is entirely rural, the only towns with upwards of 5000 inhabitants being Suri, the administrative headquarters, with a population of 7848; and M\u00e1rgram, with 6008. The 3273 villages or towns in 1881 were classified as follows:\u2014Containing less than two hundred inhabitants, 1979; from two to five hundred, 945; from five hundred to a thousand, 264; from one to two thousand, 74; from two to three thousand, 5; from three to five thousand, 4; and from five to ten thousand, 2. The Census Report of 1881 classified the male population as regards occupation under the following six main headings:\u2014(1) Professional class, including civil and military officers, all Government officials, and the learned professions, 11,089; (2) domestic servants, inn and lodging-house keepers, etc., 8351; (3) commercial class, including bankers, merchants, traders, carriers, etc., 7046; (4) agricultural and pastoral class, including gardeners, 146,308; (5) industrial class, including all manufacturers and artisans, 29,844; (6) indefinite and non-productive (including 22,583 general labourers, and 156,155 male children, and unspecified), 178,925.\n\nMaterial Condition of the People.\u2014The general style of living in B\u00edrbh\u00fam District is poor. The ordinary dress of the men consists of a waistcloth (dhuti), the quality of which differs according to the circumstances of the wearer. The houses are usually mud-walled, but one or two substantial brick houses are found in almost every village. Rice, pulse (d\u00e1l), vegetables, and fish form the ordinary food of the people. The estimated cost of living for an average-sized household of a well-to-do shopkeeper is about \u00a31, 10s. per month, and for that of an ordinary cultivator, from 8s. to 10s. a month. A peasant's holding exceeding 17 acres in extent would be considered a large-sized farm; less than 5 acres is looked upon as a very small holding. The usual\nquantity of ground cultivated by a single pair of oxen is about 5 acres; but a peasant holding a small farm of this size would not be so well off as an ordinary retail shopkeeper, nor would he be able to live so comfortably as a man with a pay of 16s. a month. As a class, the peasantry are said not to be generally in debt.\n\nThe most interesting place in the District is R\u00e1jnagar or Nagar, the ancient Hindu capital of B\u00edrbh\u00fam. The town has now fallen into decay, and the old palace is fast crumbling to ruins, but considerable portions of the famous wall or entrenchment built to protect the city from the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s still remain. This wall was from 12 to 18 feet high; it was surrounded by a ditch, and extended in an irregular and broken line round Nagar for a distance of more than 30 miles, its average distance from the town being about 4 miles. Many parts of it have now been washed level with the ground by the annual rains. Among other places of interest in Birbh\u00fam are\u2014Gan\u00fatia on the north bank of the Mor, the centre of the important silk industry of the District; Ilambazar and Dubrajpur, considerable trading villages; Surul, now a village of no importance, but once a large and flourishing town where the greater part of the Company\u2019s District trade was centred; Kenduli, the birthplace of the poet Jayadeva, in whose house 50,000 persons assemble at the annual fair in February; and T\u00e1n\u00fap\u00e1ra, near which are the hot springs already mentioned. Bolpur, Ahmadpur, Synthia, Mallarpur, R\u00e1mpurh\u00e1t, Nalh\u00e1ti, Murar\u00e1i, and R\u00e1jg\u00e1on are rapidly rising in importance as stations on the East Indian Railway, and attracting much of the trade which formerly went by water. Naw\u00e1da is a station of the State Railway from Nalh\u00e1ti to Az\u00edmganj in Murshid\u00e1b\u00e1d, which intersects the north of the District from east to west.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014The principal crop in B\u00edrbh\u00fam, as throughout the rest of Bengal, is rice. During the last quarter of a century the area under this staple has greatly extended, by the reclamation of large tracts of jungle land. It has been roughly estimated that at present fifteen-sixteenths of the tilled land in the District is under this crop. The \u00e1us or autumn crop is reaped in August and September, the ordinary \u00e1man or winter crop in November and December; an earlier variety of \u00e1man in the beginning of November. Speaking roughly, ordinary rice land, which pays a rental of 9s. an acre, yields from 13 to 17\u00bd cwts. of paddy or husked rice per acre, valued at \u00a31, 10s. to \u00a32, 2s. 8d.; land paying 18s. an acre, gives an out-turn in paddy and wheat, valued at \u00a33, 16s. to \u00a34, 10s. an acre. Among the other crops cultivated in B\u00edrbh\u00fam, are sugar-cane, mulberry, p\u00e1n, gram, peas, and oil-seeds. Manure is in general use throughout the District; the quantity of cow-dung required for rice land being about .45 cwts. per acre, valued at 6s.; while sugar-cane land requires five times that\nquantity. Irrigation is effected from tanks, which are very numerous in the District. A large proportion of the cultivators hold their lands with rights of occupancy, and, as a rule, they are not in debt. There is no class of small proprietors in the District who own, occupy, and cultivate their hereditary lands without either a superior landlord above, or a sub-tenant or labourer of any kind under them. The prices of food-grain have greatly increased of late years. In 1788, ordinary rice was selling at 2s. 10d. a cwt.; in 1872, the price was 3s. 5\u00bdd. per cwt. It is noticeable, however, that the price of rice of the finest quality, of which there is little consumption, has not altered, being both in 1788 and 1872, 4s. 3d. per cwt. The current rate of wages for coolies or ordinary day-labourers is 8s. a month; for carpenters, 16s.; for bricklayers, 16s. to \u00a31; and for blacksmiths, 16s. to \u00a31, 4s. a month.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014The District is not liable to droughts, floods, or other natural calamities, although it has occasionally suffered from scanty rainfall. During the famine of 1866, the highest price of common rice in B\u012brbh\u016bm was 15s. 8d. per cwt., and of paddy, 6s. 10d. per cwt. The means of communication and transit throughout the District are amply sufficient to allow of easy importation in case of scarcity, and to prevent the danger of any tract being isolated. The roads are good and sufficiently numerous, being 594 miles in length in 1881; the East Indian Railway runs through the District from north to south for a distance of 68 miles, and the Nalh\u0101t\u012b and Azimganj State Railway, east and west for 11 miles.\n\nCommerce and Trade.\u2014The chief export of the District is rice, which is despatched by railway both up and down the line. The other exports, such as indigo, lac, raw silk, and oil-seeds, find their way mostly to the Calcutta market. The principal imports are salt, cotton, cotton cloth, pulses, tobacco, wheat, and metal ware. The principal trading villages and seats of commerce are Dubr\u00e1jpur, Ilamb\u00e1z\u00e1r, Bolpur, Synthia, Purandarpur, Krinn\u00e1h\u00e1r, and Muhammad B\u00e1z\u00e1r Sur\u00ed. The head-quarters town of the District is unimportant from a commercial point of view. The crops of the District suffice to meet all the local wants; and in the case of rice and oil-seeds, large exports are made to other parts of the country. The exports far exceed the imports in value, and a considerable accumulation of money is said to be going on.\n\nManufactures: Silk.\u2014The principal manufacture of B\u012brbh\u016bm is silk, which is produced in the eastern part of the District; the village of Ganuti\u00e1, on the north bank of the Mor, being the head-quarters of the industry. Here is the factory which, established nearly a century ago by Mr. Frushard, under a contract for the supply of silk to the East India Company, is now owned by an English firm in Calcutta,\nand gives employment to a large number of people. The story of the annoyances to which this pioneer of silk cultivation was exposed at the hands of the Company's officers, and the manner in which he was defrauded by the R\u00e1j\u00e1, will be found at length in my Annals of Rural Bengal. It can only be briefly stated here that, being charged for the land he bought more than four times its market value, he soon fell into arrears with the R\u00e1j\u00e1, who made his non-payment an excuse for being himself behind with his land-tax. The Collector could not distrain the factory lands, as such a step would have interfered with the regular supply of the silk investment, and Mr. Frushard secured himself from arrest by living beyond his jurisdiction. The case was at length brought before the Court of Directors; and eventually, Lord Cornwallis, in 1791, ordered that all his past arrears should be forgiven, that his rent should for the future be reduced by nearly one-half, and that the Collector should deduct whatever this sum amounted to from the land-tax payable by the R\u00e1j\u00e1. Since that time things have gone smoothly, and Mr. Frushard's factory, several times renewed, is now one of the most important buildings in the District. The annual outlay averages \u00a372,000, and the value of the general silk manufactures exceeds \u00a3160,000. The silk is usually sold in a raw state, and finds its way to the Calcutta and European markets. The factory at Ganuti\u00e1 is surrounded by numbers of smaller filatures, the silk reeled in these being either consumed in the local manufacture of piece-goods, or sent to Murshid\u00e1b\u00e1d, and the silk-consuming towns of the North-West Provinces and the Punjab.\n\nFour varieties of domesticated or regularly bred silkworms are known in B\u00edrbh\u00fam, the best silk being obtained from the *bara palu*, an annual worm. The breeding of the worm is conducted in the following manner. The cocoons are formed in March, the earliest formed being reserved for breeding purposes. The moths begin to emerge on the eighth day after the formation of the cocoon, and continue to emerge till the eleventh day. As the moths make their way out of the cocoons, they are put into other baskets, and the males and females for the most part pair spontaneously and at once. About the middle of the day, the males and females are separated, the males being thrown away, and the females placed on a cloth in a large basket. An hour afterwards, they begin to lay eggs, and continue laying during the night and till the afternoon of the following day. The eggs are then wrapped in three or four folds of cloth and put in an earthen pot, which is covered over with a plastering of earth and cow-dung. In the following January or February the pots are opened, and the eggs begin to hatch, those hatched each day being kept separate. The hatching extends over a period varying from 15 to 25 days according to the temperature. The worms are fed as soon as hatched,\u2014during\nthe first stage on the tenderest leaves chopped fine, then on whole leaves, and in the last stage the twigs are thrown in whole. Food is given three times a day. The worms are kept in baskets which are placed in a wooden stand, one above the other; as the worms grow, they are placed in larger baskets with fewer worms to each. The full-grown larva is about an inch long and three-quarters of an inch in girth, generally of a white colour with the usual black markings, but the white is tinged with varying shades of yellow and red in different worms. From about twelve to eight days after the last moult, according to the temperature, the worms begin to form their cocoons. They are then placed in a tray which is partitioned off into spinning holes by slips of bamboo, and placed with its back to the sun, the warmth promoting the formation of the cocoon. After formation, the chrysalides which are not wanted for propagation are killed by exposure to the sun, and the cocoons are then ready for the market. Of this kind of silkworm, twelve kah\u00e1ns (1280 \u00d7 12 = 15,360) of cocoons will yield one local ser or 1\u00bd lbs. avoirdupois of spun silk. Another variety of silkworm, the nistri worm, is smaller than the above, and five breedings or crops (bands) are obtained in the course of the year, of which those obtained in January and July are the best. Two crops out of the five seem to be altogether neglected, and are called chh\u00f3r\u00e1 or refuse bands in consequence. The cocoon of the nistri is of a golden colour, but the yield is less than that of the bara palu\u2014sixteen kah\u00e1ns (1280 \u00d7 16 = 20,480) of cocoons only produce one local ser or 1\u00bd lbs. of silk. The eggs hatch in nine or ten days. In the cold weather, the cycle of the worm is about sixty days, reduced in the hot weather to forty. The desi or chhott\u00e1 palu also yields some five or six crops during the year. In most respects it is very like the nistri, and its yield of silk is about the same.\n\nNo estimate exists showing the total out-turn of cocoons, but it is considerably less now than formerly, owing partly to the depressed state of the silk trade, and partly to the prevalence of disease among the worms. The insect suffers from three maladies in Birbh\u00fam District, known as (1) chit rog, (2) narmja rog, and (3) katase rog. The first-named disease seizes the worm in its final stage. Those attacked turn quite hard and die; and it is said that even the crows, who greedily devour the worms whenever they get a chance, will not eat those which have died of this disorder. The second attacks the worm when about to spin. Little white spots or pustules break out on the body, and the worm becomes torpid, and in two or three days melts away in corruption. The third disease may come at any stage of growth. The worms seized turn a greyish colour, water runs from the mouth, and they ultimately rot away. All three diseases are believed to be eminently contagious. The description of the disease does not\nseem to correspond with that of either peprine or gattine, the maladies most dreaded in Europe. No remedies are adopted, and it is said that none have ever been tried.\n\nFrom the silkworm traders the cocoons pass to the filatures. Sometimes a cultivator who grows the mulberry keeps worms as well, and also reels off the cocoons himself; but more generally the three operations of growing the mulberry, rearing worms, and reeling silk, are kept quite distinct, and are performed by different persons. The cocoons used at the factories are either bought by contract direct from the breeders, or through commission agents. The European factory at Ganuti\u00e1, and its branch filatures, have been alluded to above. But in addition to these there are numerous little village filatures, worked by native families. These village filatures, with perhaps one pair of basins apiece, are situated in the peasant's homestead, and worked in a very rude way. The raw silk from the English factory finds its way to the Calcutta and European markets. That reeled in the villages is partly consumed locally, and partly sent to the Murshid\u00e1b\u00e1d market, and to the silk-consuming towns of the North-Western Provinces and the Punjab. Some part also finds its way to the looms of Surat and Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d in Bombay, or is worked up into dh\u00fati fringes in the Central Provinces. The Bombay weavers buy a kind of raw silk called bhursut woven from ten cocoons, and therefore thicker than the five or six cocoon thread which finds favour in the Calcutta market. The local fabrics of silk are plain piece-goods; but very little silk-weaving is carried on. The weavers who manufacture silk fabrics generally work under a system of advances from the Murshid\u00e1b\u00e1d silk dealers. A few, however, are sufficiently enterprising to invest their little capital on their own account.\n\nTasar silk is manufactured in the western parts of the District, and at Ilamb\u00e1z\u00e1r on the north bank of the Aj\u00e1i. The trade in tasar silk cloth has declined of late years, owing to a falling off in the demand in the Calcutta market. Cotton-weaving is carried on to a considerable extent, giving employment to 7500 cotton-weavers, and this industry appears to have more vitality in B\u00edrbh\u00fam than in some other Bengal Districts. The cultivators buy in the market the cotton of the North-Western Provinces, have it spun into rude yarn by the women, and take the yarn to the village weaver, who weaves it up into coarse cloth, under the eye of the owner or a representative, who always sits by to see that the yarn is not stolen. Some widows eke out a livelihood by spinning cotton, and spinning the Br\u00e1hmanical thread is an occupation usually confined to Br\u00e1hman widows. The preparation of indigo and shell-lac are among the other industries, and attempts have recently been made to utilize the local supply of iron. The ores have long been worked on the rough native mode of smelting; and the object of\nthe recent attempts was to ascertain whether more extended operations might not be profitably carried out according to European processes, under competent supervision. Although the iron produced seems to have been of good quality and well suited for manufacturing purposes, the experiment was not a financial success, and the enterprise dropped.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The administrative staff of the District in 1881-82 consisted of a Magistrate-Collector, Joint Magistrate, and European Deputy Collector, 4 native Deputy Collectors, District superintendent of police with an assistant, civil and sessions judge and sub-judge, 4 subordinate civil judges (munsifs), civil surgeon, district engineer, 12 honorary magistrates, 4 rural sub-registrars, etc. In consequence of the numerous changes which have taken place from time to time in the area of B\u012brbh\u016bm District, it is impossible to compare with any accuracy the revenue and expenditure at different periods; but the figures at our disposal show, in a very distinct way, the prosperity which the District has enjoyed under British rule. In 1790-91, the net revenue of the District, which then consisted of B\u012brbh\u016bm (including the greater part of the Sant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s) and Bishnupur, was \u00a3108,270, and the net civil expenditure \u00a36281. At the time of the Permanent Settlement (1793), Bishnupur or B\u00e1nkur\u00e1 was separated from B\u012brbh\u016bm, and in 1820-21 the revenue had fallen to \u00a378,248, the expenditure being \u00a311,930. In 1850-51, the revenue was \u00a389,300, and the expenditure \u00a323,719. In 1860-61, the revenue amounted to \u00a393,795, and the expenditure to \u00a323,207. Subsequent to 1860 the area of the District was further reduced by the transfer of several pargan\u00e1s, but the revenue and expenditure continued to increase; and in 1870-71 the total net revenue was \u00a3102,841, or nearly the same as that of the united District in 1790, while the net civil expenditure was \u00a328,054, or more than four times what it was in 1790. In 1881-82, after the area of the District had been increased by the transfer of R\u00e1mpur-hat police circle from Murshid\u00e1b\u00e1d, the total revenue of B\u012brbh\u016bm amounted to \u00a3124,372, and the net civil expenditure to \u00a343,295, or seven times the amount of expenditure in 1790. In 1790-91, the joint land revenue of B\u012brbh\u016bm and B\u00e1nkur\u00e1 amounted to \u00a3106,071; in 1870-71, the land revenue of B\u012brbh\u016bm alone was \u00a373,558; and in 1881, \u00a380,174.\n\nWith the increasing prosperity of the District, the machinery for the protection of person and property has been improved. The police force employed for this purpose in 1881 consisted of (1) a regular police, composed of 2 superior and 47 subordinate officers and 208 constables; (2) a small municipal force of 1 native officer and 16 men for the protection of Sur\u00ed; and (3) a village watch of 7614 gh\u00e1tw\u00e1ls and chaukid\u00edrs: total, 7898 officers and men, or 1 man to every 100 of the population. The cost of maintaining the District and municipal\npolice in 1881 was \u00a35749, of which \u00a35589 was derived from imperial funds, equal to an average of 3s. per head of the population; and exclusive of an estimated sum of \u00a313,392 contributed in money or lands by the zamindars and villagers. In 1881, 804 persons were convicted of 'cognisable' and 533 of 'non-cognisable' offences, or 1 person to every 594 of the population.\n\nThere are seven th\u00e1n\u00e1s or police circles in the District, namely\u2014Sur\u00ed, Dubr\u00e1jpur, S\u00e1kulipur, R\u00e1mpur-h\u00e1t, Maureswar, and Nalh\u00e1t, besides nine outpost stations. There are two jails in B\u00eerbh\u00fbm, one at Sur\u00ed, and the other (a lock-up) at R\u00e1mpur-h\u00e1t. The daily average jail population in 1881 was 185\u00b716, or 1 person always in jail to every 429\u00b74 of the population of the District. These figures are, however, illusory, as they include a large proportion of prisoners sent from the Sant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s, where there is no proper jail. Education has made rapid progress of late years. In 1856-57, there were only 3 Government and aided schools in the whole District; by 1872-73, the number of Government and aided schools had risen to 129, attended by 4439 pupils. In addition to these, there were 17 inspected unaided schools, attended by 445 pupils, and about 550 uninspected, with an estimated attendance of more than 7000 more. The total number of pupils attending inspected schools in that year was 4884. By 1881, the total number of Government aided and inspected schools had risen to 613, attended by 11,777 pupils, or 1 to every 67 of the population. The number of schools not inspected by the Department had fallen to 20 in 1881, with 399 pupils.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The mean annual temperature of B\u00eerbh\u00fbm, according to the latest calculation, is 77\u00b025' F., and the average annual rainfall 56\u00b749 inches. The District has long been famous for its salubrity; but unhappily within the last few years the epidemic fever of Bardw\u00e1n, after effecting so much devastation in adjoining Districts, has extended to B\u00eerbh\u00fbm, causing great mortality, which has resulted in a decrease of the population to the extent of 6\u00b795 per cent. during the nine years between 1872 and 1881. An account of this fever will be found in the article on Bardwan. The only endemic diseases prevalent in the District are leprosy and elephantiasis; cholera has of late years become more general.

Besides the usual public offices, there are several schools, a number of Hindu temples, and some Muhammadan mosques. The old military high road from Calcutta to the North-Western Provinces passed through the town. Ancient Bishnupur, if we may put any trust in the native chroniclers, was a magnificent city, 'more beautiful than the beautiful house of Indra in heaven.' It was fortified by a connected line of curtains and bastions, 7 miles in length, with small circular ravelins covering many of the curtains. The citadel lies within the fortifications, and here was situated the palace of the R\u00e1j\u00e1s. The ruins are very curious and interesting. Near the south gateway are the remains of an extensive series of granaries; and inside the fort, which is overgrown with jungle, lies an immense iron gun, 10\u00bd feet long, the gift, according to tradition, of a deity to one of the R\u00e1j\u00e1s. In the last century, the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Bishnupur figures in the Company's records as one of the most important of the Hindu nobility of Bengal. In the map to the Abb\u00e9 Raynal's History of the East and West Indies (London edition, 1776), 'Bissenpour' and Calcutta are the only two cities which appear in large letters in the present Lieutenant-Governorship of Bengal. For further information based on the local records, see my Annals of Rural Bengal.\n\n**Bison Range** (native name, P\u00e1pi-Konda).\u2014The highest part of the hills which form the northern frontier of God\u00e1var\u00ed District, Madras Presidency. Height, about 3000 feet. Situated to the west of the magnificent gorge by which the God\u00e1var\u00ed enters the District; the range is remarkable for its fine scenery and abundance of large game; its sides are clothed with luxuriant teak forest.\n\n**Bisr\u00e1mpur.**\u2014Village in Sarg\u00faj\u00e1 State, Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur. Lat. $23^\\circ 2'$ N., long. $83^\\circ 14' 10''$ E. The residence of the chief, Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 Indrajit Singh. Contains a school supported by the R\u00e1j\u00e1 and the principal landholders. A weekly market is held in the village, attended only by people living in the immediate neighbourhood.\n\n**Bisr\u00e1mpur Coal-Field.**\u2014The name given to an area of coal measure rocks, situated in the eastern portion of the comparatively low-\nlying ground in the centre of Sarg\u00faj\u00e1 State, Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur. It occupies an area of about 400 square miles, throughout which, except in the river-beds or their immediate neighbourhood, and on a few small hills, no rocks are exposed, a covering of alluvium concealing oil. Good coal exists in abundance, and in a suitable condition for working, but borings (which could alone furnish facts sufficiently trustworthy for estimating the extent and thickness of individual seams, and generally the total amount of coal existing in the field) have not yet been made. It is, however, very probable that when the series of railways it is proposed to construct on and near the Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur plateau, are completed, that these mines will be extensively worked. A road could be easily made from the Loh\u00e1rdag\u00e1 plateau to Sarg\u00faj\u00e1. A detailed account of the field has been given by Mr. V. Ball, from whose paper, quoted in the Statistical Account of Bengal, vol. xvii. pp. 225-228, the above information is taken.\n\n**Bissau (Basw\u00e1).**\u2014Town in Shaikhaw\u00e1t\u00ed District, Jaipur (Jeypore) State, R\u00e1jput\u00e1n\u00e1, about 120 miles north-west of Jaipur town.

The only building of any importance is the R\u00e1j\u00e1's fort, an erection of mud. The inhabitants being suspected of the practice of human sacrifice, this town was included in the proscribed circle of the Meriah Agency in 1851.\u2014See JAIPUR.\n\n**Bissemkatak.**\u2014One of the 7 Kandh muttas of Vizagapatam District, Madras Presidency, proscribed by the officers of the Meriah Agency in 1851 as addicted to human sacrifice. It contains 497 villages divided into 8 sub-muttas \u2014 Kanakal\u00e1di, Jig\u00e1da, Sog\u00e1ta, Kojiri, Ambodalu, Bhangoda, Jagdalpur, and Kutragoda. Situated west of Rayab\u00edg\u00ed, in the highly cultivated country of the Deshya or 'outer' Kandhs (as distinguished from the Kotiya or mountaineer Kandhs, who inhabit only a few villages), with Bissemkatak, the capital of the T\u00e1t R\u00e1j\u00e1, as its chief town. All the villages are under supervision. The t\u00e1luk enjoys considerable trade, exporting grain, tobacco, saffron, mustard and gingelly seeds, and unrefined sugar in exchange for iron, cloths, and salt.\n\n**Bisw\u00e1n.**\u2014Tahsil or Sub-division of Sit\u00e1pur District, Oudh; bounded north by Nigh\u00e1san, east by Bahraich, south by B\u00e1ri, and west by Sit\u00e1pur tahs\u00edls.

These officers preside over 2 civil and 3 criminal courts; strength of regular police, 62 men; village watchmen (chauk\u012bd\u0101rs), 1049.\n\nBisw\u00e1n.\u2014Pargan\u0101 in S\u00edt\u00e1pur District, Oudh; bounded on the north by L\u00e1harpur and Tambaur, on the east by Kundri, on the south by Mahmud\u00e1b\u0101d and B\u0101r\u012b, and on the west by P\u00edrnagar and Khair\u00e1b\u0101d. The land in the east of the pargan\u0101 is very low, and much cut up by small streams leading to the Chauka, which marks the boundary line. West of this lies a rich tract of country, always green, owing to the proximity of water to the surface, and bearing fine crops. A high ridge of land, which appears to have formed once the right bank of the Chauka, runs through the pargan\u0101. The extreme west lies high. Area, 220 square miles, or 140,688 acres, of which 98,721 are cultivated, and 26,220 cultivable but not under tillage.

Lat. 26\u00b0 25' 20\" N., long. 80\u00b0 36' 25\" E. The head-quarters of the R\u00e1wat tribe, who formerly owned the whole of the large pargan\u0101 of Harha, in which the village is situated. Population (1881) 3187, namely, Hindus, 3001; and Muhammadans, 186. Ten Sivaite temples; bi-weekly market; Government school.\n\nBith\u00far (Bithaur).\u2014Town in Cawnpur District, North-Western Provinces, lying on the south bank of the Ganges, 12 miles north-west\nof Cawnpur City. Lat. $26^\\circ 36' 50''$ N., long. $80^\\circ 19'$ E.; population (1881) 6685, namely, 5970 Hindus and 715 Muhammadans; area of town site, 217 acres. A small municipal revenue for police and conservancy purposes is raised under the provisions of Act xx. of 1856. Picturesque front facing the river, adorned by gh\u00e1ts or bathing steps, temples, and handsome residences. The principal gh\u00e1t, built by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Tik\u00e1it R\u00e1i, minister of Gh\u00e1zi-ud-d\u00edn Haidar, Naw\u00e1b of Oudh, with an imposing Saracenic arcade on its upper platform, is known as the Br\u00e1hma gh\u00e1t, being sacred to that god; and a bathing fair is held there on the full moon in November. B\u00e1j\u00ed R\u00e1o, the last of the Peshw\u00e1s, was banished to Bith\u00far, and had extensive palaces in the town. His adopted son, Dandhu Panth, better known as the N\u00e1n\u00e1 S\u00e1hib, was the instigator of the massacre at CAWNPUR. The town was captured by Havelock's force on the 19th of July 1857, when the N\u00e1n\u00e1's palaces were utterly destroyed; but he himself succeeded in making good his escape. On the 16th of August, after Havelock's first unsuccessful attempt to reach Lucknow, Bith\u00far was once more retaken, and never again lost. Its population and importance have greatly declined since the extinction of its local court. Large numbers of Br\u00e1hmans reside in the town, and superintend the bathing festivals. A branch of the Ganges Canal is in course of construction to Bith\u00far.\n\n**Bitraganta.**\u2014Village in the Kav\u00e1li t\u00e1luk, Nellore District, Madras Presidency.

The resident population of the village in 1881 was returned at only 111, but the weekly market on Sundays is attended by a large number of non-residents.\n\n**Bobbili.**\u2014An estate in Vizagapatam District, Madras Presidency. Lat. $18^\\circ 22'$ to $18^\\circ 46'$ N., long. $83^\\circ 10'$ to $83^\\circ 20'$ E.; area, 227 square miles, containing 178 villages, with 29,023 houses, and (1881) 139,974 inhabitants, almost all Hindus: males, 69,666; females, 70,308. Surrounded by the British t\u00e1luks of Chip\u00farpalle, Vizian\u00e1garam, S\u00e1l\u00far, Palkonda, and Bobbili. It consists of 3 p\u00e1rjan\u00e1s, Bobbili, R\u00e1jam, and K\u00e1vite, and yields to its owner a revenue of \u00a337,500 per annum. Of\nthis, \u00a38977 is paid to Government as tribute or peshkash. This estate is one of the most ancient in the Presidency, and possesses an interesting history. When, in 1652, Sher Muhammad Kh\u00e1n, the Naw\u00e1b of Chicacole, entered the District, there followed in his train two rivals\u2014the one Peddar\u00e1yudu, the ancestor of the present chief of Bobbili, the other the ancestor of the Vizian\u00e1garam family; and from this time dates the rivalry between the two houses. Peddar\u00e1yudu soon after received, in reward for gallantry, the estate of R\u00e1jam, where he built a fort, naming it Bobbili (the royal tiger), in honour of his patron's designation, Sher (tiger). This estate bordered on Vizian\u00e1garam, and the ill-feeling between the chiefs was fomented by constant embroilment. In 1756, the turbulence of the Poligars called for measures of repression, and M. Bussy marched with a European force to restore order. On his reaching Vizian\u00e1garam, the R\u00e1j\u00e1 assured him that the chief of Bobbili was the instigator of all disturbances, and to testify his own loyalty, joined the French with a force of 11,000 men to assist in crushing his rival. Before attacking him, Bussy offered the chief a pardon for the past, and lands of equal value elsewhere, if he would abandon his ancestral estate; but the offer was refused.\n\nThe attack which followed on the fort at Bobbili is one of the most memorable in Franco-Indian history. At daybreak, the field-pieces began to play on the mud defences, practicable breaches were at once made, and the assault sounded. After four hours' desperate hand-to-hand fighting, Bussy called off his men to allow the cannon to widen the breaches. A second assault was then ordered, but with no better results, for not a man had gained footing within the ramparts, when, five hours later, Bussy again withdrew the storming party to repeat the argument of artillery. The defenders now recognised their desperate position, and collecting their wives and families, put them to death, and returned to their posts. The assault soon recommenced; and when at sunset Bussy entered the fort as victor with the remnant of his army, it was only because every man of the garrison was dead or desperately wounded. An old man, however, crept from a hut, and leading a child to Bussy, presented him as the son of the dead chief. Four other men had preserved their lives; and two nights later, when the Vizian\u00e1garam camp was buried in sleep, they crept into the R\u00e1j\u00e1's tent, and before the sentries had discovered and shot down the assassins, they had stabbed the R\u00e1j\u00e1 to death with thirty-two wounds.\n\nThe child Chinna Ranga R\u00e1o, saved from the slaughter, was invested by Bussy with the chiefship of the lands that had been offered to his father; but before he attained his majority, his uncle regained by force of arms the former estate of R\u00e1jam. At last the Vizian\u00e1garam family compromised with their rivals, and leased to them the K\u00e1vite and R\u00e1jam pargan\u00e1s. The old feud, however, again broke out, and the\nBobbili chief fled into the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s country. But in 1794, when the Vizian\u00e1garam estate was dismembered, Chinna Ranga R\u00e1o was restored by the British to his father\u2019s domains, and in 1801 a permanent settlement was concluded with his son at an annual tribute of \u00a39000. Since then the peace of the estate has been undisturbed.\n\n**Bobbili.**\u2014Town in the Bobbili estate, Vizagapatam District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 18\u00b0 34\u2019 N., long. 83\u00b0 25\u2019 E.; houses, 3010; population (1881) 14,946, namely, 14,545 Hindus, 329 Muhammadans, 38 Christians, and 34 \u2018others.\u2019 Situated about 70 miles north-west of Vizagapatam. As the head-quarters of the taluk, it possesses a sub-magistrate\u2019s court, a sub-registrar\u2019s office, dispensary, school, etc. A fortified enclosure in the centre of the town surrounds the temple and the residence of the chief.\u2014See BOBBILI ESTATE, supra.\n\n**Bod.**\u2014The most westerly of the Tributary States of Orissa, lying between 20\u00b0 13\u2019 and 20\u00b0 53\u2019 30\u201d N. lat., and between 83\u00b0 36\u2019 45\u201d and 84\u00b0 50\u2019 E. long.; area, including the Kandh-m\u00e1ls (under British administration), 2064 square miles; population (1881) 130,103. The State is bounded on the north by the Mah\u00e1n\u00e1di river, separating it from Sonpur State in the Central Provinces, and from Athmallik State; on the east by Daspall\u00e1; on the south by the Madras States of Goomsur (Gumsar) and Kimidi; and on the west by Patn\u00e1 and Sonpur States in the Central Provinces, from which it is separated by the Tel river. Bod is under the supervision of the Commissioner of Cuttack and the Government of Bengal. To the south of Bod proper, are the Kandh Hills, now under British management, but formerly feudatory to the Bod R\u00e1j\u00e1. The tract comprising the Kandh-m\u00e1ls consists of a broken plateau intersected by ridges of low hills, the last refuge of the Kandh race. The principal hills in the State are\u2014Bondig\u00e1r\u00e1 on the southern border, 3308 feet high; Bankomund\u00ed, 2080 feet; and Si\u00e1n\u00e1ng\u00e1, 1917 feet.\n\nThe population of Bod, including the Kandh-m\u00e1ls, numbered in 1881, 130,103, living in 1741 villages and 16,409 houses; number of males 66,754, females 63,349; average density of population per square mile, 63; persons per village, 74; persons per house, 7.9. Classified according to religion, the Census thus divides the population: Hindus, 93,011; Muhammadans, 73; Christian, 1; aboriginal tribes, 37,018. Separate details of the population, etc., of the Kandh-m\u00e1ls will be found in the article on that tract. The following are the figures for Bod proper without the Kandh-m\u00e1ls. Total population, 71,144, living in 856 villages and 14,242 houses; number of males 36,723, females 34,421; persons per village, 83; persons per house, 5. Classified according to religion, the Census thus divides the population: Hindus, 71,075; and Muhammadans, 69. There is a considerable aboriginal population in Bod, but owing to a different system of classification\nbetween the Census of 1872 and 1881, only those who still cling to their ancient religion have been returned by the last Census as aborigines, and in Bod proper they are included among the Hindus.\n\nThe Mah\u00e1nadi, which forms the northern boundary of the State, and the Tel, which borders it on the west, afford excellent facilities for water carriage; but except a little s\u00e1l timber, none of the produce of the country is exported. Weekly markets are held at eight villages, the principal commodities sold being coarse rice, oil-seeds, and jungle products. The largest and most important village, and the residence of the R\u00e1j\u00e1, is Bod (lat. 29\u00b0 50' 20\" N., long. 84\u00b0 21' 41\" E.), in the north of the State on the right bank of the Mah\u00e1nadi, 190 miles from the sea. The only other village of any size is Jagatigarh.\n\nThe State yields an estimated revenue of \u00a32400 a year to its chief; the tribute to the British Government is \u00a380. The reigning family claims an uninterrupted descent from a stranger who founded the petty principality about a thousand years ago; they are R\u00e1jputs of the Solar race. The R\u00e1j\u00e1's militia in Bod proper consists of 22 men, and his police force is of the same strength. He maintains a school. A post-office has recently been established.\n\n**Bod\u00e1.**\u2014An extensive zam\u00ednd\u00e1ri (estate) belonging to the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Kuch Behar State, Bengal.

Lat. 21\u00b0 20' N., long. 73\u00b0 7' E.; population (1872) 3305. No later return of population is available. The fair is held when the planet Jupiter enters the constellation of the Lion, an event which happens every twelve years; about 2000 people attend, the majority being from Surat, Broach, and Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d Districts, and from Baroda and R\u00e1jpipla territory. The last fair was held in September 1872. The temple contains the image of Gautameshw\u00e1r M\u00e1hadeo, in whose honour the fair is held. The temple holds lands free of rent.\n\n**Bodh Gay\u00e1.**\u2014See Buddh Gay\u00e1.\n\n**Bodin\u00e1yakan\u00far.**\u2014Estate in Mad\u00fara District, Madras Presidency.\nArea, 98 square miles, containing 21 villages and hamlets, with 6509 houses, and (1871) 34,497 inhabitants. Later information is not available. Situated in the valley between the Travancore and Pal\u00e1n\u00ed ranges, watered by the Teni river. This estate was one of the original 72 Naiakais Palaiyam of Mad\u00fara, the family having emigrated from Gooty (G\u00fati) in 1336 A.D. It was resumed by Haidar Ali in 1776, and after an interval of semi-independence, again reduced by Tip\u00fa. The R\u00e1ja of Travancore subsequently seized the estate, but in 1793 the Bodin\u00e1yakan\u00far chief recovered possession. When, in 1795, the Company's officers proceeded to the settlement of the District, they were resisted by the chief of Bodin\u00e1yakan\u00far, and the party was fired upon. It was one of the largest of the 24 Palaiyams then settled, containing 30 villages, and yielding about \u00a37000 per annum. Annual tribute paid to Government, \u00a31534.\n\nBodin\u00e1yakan\u00far.\u2014Town in Mad\u00fara District, Madras Presidency.

Bodwad was once a place of some consequence, and the ruined remains of an old fort, city gateways, and an old reservoir still exist.\n\nBogger\u00fa.\u2014River in Nellore District, Madras Presidency. Rising among the Gh\u00e1ts at Boggu Venk\u00e1tapuram, it drains the country west and south of the Durg\u00e1m, and flowing through Atmak\u00far, it joins the Penn\u00e9r at Sang\u00e1m, where the two rivers have overspread a considerable tract with alluvial deposits. The Atmak\u00far t\u00e1luk to some extent, and the Udayagiri t\u00e1luk almost entirely, depend upon the Bogger\u00fa for irrigation.\n\nBogoola.\u2014Village in Nadiy\u00e1 District, Bengal.\u2014See Bagula.\n\nBogra (Bagur\u00e1).\u2014District occupying the east central portion of the R\u00e1jsh\u00e1h\u00ed Division, under the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal. It lies between 24\u00b0 32' 15\" and 25\u00b0 18' 30\" N. lat., and between 88\u00b0 54' 15\" and 89\u00b0 48' 0\" E. long., its eastern boundary being roughly formed by the main channel of the Brahmaputra; area, 1498 square miles;\npopulation, according to the Census of 1881, 734,358 souls. The administrative head-quarters are at Bogra town on the Karatoya river.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The District presents the usual appearance of an alluvial tract, consisting of one level plain, seamed with river-beds and studded with marshes. It naturally divides into two portions of unequal size, an eastern tract forming part of the valley of the Brahmaputra, and closely resembling the country in Maimansingh on the opposite bank; and a western and larger portion, which merges into the undulating clay lands of Dinajpur. Both these tracts are profoundly modified by the fluvial action of the great streams which flow through or over them; but the boundary between the two constitutes an important landmark in the geographical system of Bengal. The soil of the Brahmaputra valley is pure alluvion of a whitish colour, locally called pali, the recent deposit of the river floods. In the western tract the soil is a stiff clay of a reddish colour, known as khiir, which rests upon a lower stratum of sand; the country is generally above flood-level, and much overgrown with scrub jungle. In this region are situated the peculiar plots of mulberry-land, which are raised by trenching and embankment above the danger of inundation.\n\nThe river system is constituted by the numerous channels of the great river of Rangpur, which is variously known as the Tista or Atrai. The Brahmaputra itself, locally termed the D\u00e1okob\u00e1 or Hatchet-cut, only fringes the eastern frontier of the District as far as the junction of the Manas. The other rivers of the District are the Jamuna, Nagar, Karatoya or Phuljur, Bangali, and Manas. Most of these intermingle with one another by cross streams; and they fall ultimately either into the Atrai, or directly into the Brahmaputra. They are all portions of the same drainage system, and their comparative importance is so variable that it would be useless to describe the course of any particular channel in any given year. Historically, the Karatoya was the main river which brought down towards the Ganges the great volume of Tista water, before the disastrous floods of 1787. The width of its former bed is still pointed out, and numerous local traditions bear witness to its early importance. At present, it is one of the minor rivers of the District, and but little used for navigation. There are no lakes in Bogra, but marshes are numerous, especially in the east and south of the District, where the greater part of the country is a network of marshes interlacing in and out of the District. Most of these dry up from the end of January till the rains, but many are always flooded. Nothing has been done to drain any of these swamps, but several are silting up. All except the deepest are largely utilized for the cultivation of the long-stemmed variety of rice, which is generally sown from transplanted seedlings at the beginning of the rains, and grows with the rise of the water. The Collector of the\nDistrict reported in 1873 that this rice 'rises with the floods, however deep they may be. It is almost impossible to drown it. It grows as high as 23 feet, and can bear submersion for two or three weeks together without suffering much injury.' Large forests formerly existed in this District, but they have in most cases been ruthlessly cut down, a few large patches remaining only in the police divisions of Panchbibi and Sherpur. At the same time, the country is still fairly wooded, and many valuable forest trees are indigenous to it. The jungle products consist of various dyes, and beeswax. Ample pasture ground is found along the older sandy banks or chars of the Brahmaputra, which are always covered with coarse grass, and in places with the fine dub grass. These latter lands are left uncultivated, not in consequence of any infertility, but from fear of floods. The larger sorts of game in the District are the tiger, leopard, buffalo, deer, and wild pig. Small game, such as hares, pea-fowl, snipe, quail, ortolan, wild geese, wild duck, teal, and pigeons, is plentiful. Fish abound, being represented principally by the perch, carp, siluroid, and herring families; the fisheries form valuable properties.\n\nHistory.\u2014Bogr\u00e1 has no political history of its own. The District was first formed in 1821, out of certain th\u00e1n\u00e1s or police divisions taken from R\u00e1jsh\u00e1h\u00ed, Din\u00e1jpur, and Rangpur. It was found necessary at that time to provide additional facilities for the administration of criminal justice in these outlying tracts, which could not be properly supervised from the head-quarters of their several Districts. This region, also, was then rising into notice as a remunerative field for European enterprise, in the form of indigo-planting and silk-winding. For these reasons, a Joint-Magistrate was stationed at Bogr\u00e1 town, in whom only criminal jurisdiction was vested. The duties of revenue collection, together with the title of Deputy-Collector, were added in 1832; but it was not till 1859 that Bogr\u00e1 was erected into an independent District with a Magistrate-Collector of its own. Even at the present day, traces may be found of the gradual growth of the several administrations, and much perplexity still exists with regard to the boundaries of the fiscal and magisterial areas. In accordance with a principle which has long lost its original utility, large estates were permitted, on removal from the criminal supervision of their old Districts, to continue to pay revenue into the parent treasury. The fiscal jurisdiction thus broken up has never been again reunited under a single authority. Again, considerable portions of Bogr\u00e1 were surveyed with the neighbouring Districts to which they had been once attached; and the numerous series of papers, which guarantee the efficiency of local administration, lie scattered at R\u00e1mpur Beauleah, Nasir\u00e1b\u00e1d, and Din\u00e1jpur. In addition to these fundamental causes of confusion, Bogr\u00e1 has experienced its full share of those frequent recti-\nfications of the executive frontier, which so greatly destroy the value of all statistical comparisons throughout Bengal.\n\nThe historical interest of the District centres round Mah\u00e1sth\u00e1n Garh, and the town of Sherpur. The former place is now a great mound of earth, bounded on one side by the dwindling stream of the Karatoy\u00e1, and strewn with bricks and a few carvings in stone. But when the Karatoy\u00e1 was a great river, Mah\u00e1sth\u00e1n was the capital of an early Hindu dynasty, of which numerous traditions still live in the memories of the people. In later times it has become a Muhammadan place of pilgrimage, being associated with the name of Sh\u00e1h Sult\u00e1n, a fak\u00edr who figures prominently in the story of the Musalm\u00e1n conquest. Sherpur town represents a more trustworthy epoch in Bengal history. It is mentioned by the Mughal chroniclers of the 16th century, and appears under the disguise of 'Ceerpoor Mirts' in the map of Bengal by Von den Broucke, the Dutch Governor of India in 1660. These notices it owed to its importance as a frontier post of the Muhammadans, previous to the establishment of the Naw\u00e1bs of Dacca. It is now the residence of three Br\u00e1hman families, who rank among the wealthiest landholders in the district.\n\nPopulation.\u2014Various early estimates of the number of the population are extant, but it is not known that any of them were based upon trustworthy principles. The most plausible conjecture places the total at 900,000 souls, at a time when the District was larger by about one-third than it is now. The Census of 1872, with the District area the same as at present, disclosed a population of 689,467 persons. The latest enumeration, in 1881, returned the inhabitants of the District at 734,358, showing an increase of 44,891, or 6\u00b75 per cent., in the nine years between 1872 and 1881. Area of District, 1,498 square miles; number of villages, 4,202; number of houses, 103,643, of which 99,473 were occupied and 4,170 unoccupied. Average density of population, 490\u00b723 per square mile; villages per square mile, 2\u00b781; houses per square mile, 69\u00b719; persons per village, 175; persons per occupied house, 7\u00b738. Divided according to sex, the males numbered 372,677, and the females 361,681. Classified according to religion, the Muhammadans numbered 593,411, or 80\u00b780 per cent. of the entire population; Hindus 140,860, or 19\u00b718 per cent.; Jains, 54; Buddhists, 2; Christians, 27; and 'others,' 4. It was one of the surprises revealed by the first regular Census of the District in 1872, that the Musalm\u00e1ns constitute more than four-fifths of the inhabitants of the District. There can be no doubt that in Bogr\u00e1, as throughout the rest of the Brahmaputra valley, the great bulk of the people are of aboriginal descent; and that the majority willingly adopted the conquering faith of Isl\u00e1m, in preference to remaining outcastes beyond the pale of Hinduism. As elsewhere throughout India, almost the\nentire Muhammadan population belong to the Hanafi sect of Sunnis. A certain proportion of them are said to be indoctrinated with the fanaticism of the reformed Faraizi sect; and so late as 1871, there was a State prosecution for Wah\u00e1bi disaffection. The Musalm\u00e1n fairs and places of pilgrimage are well attended, especially the ceremonies connected with the name of Gh\u00e1z\u00ed Miy\u00e1n. Of the semi-Hinduized aborigines, the three cognate tribes of Koch, P\u00e1li, and R\u00e1jbans\u00ed make up a total of 19,955 souls; and it is known that many of the Muhammadans belong to the same ethnical stock. Among the Hindus proper, Br\u00e1hmans number 4614; R\u00e1jputs, 372; K\u00e1yasths, 3759; and Baniy\u00e1s, 7486. The most numerous caste is the Kaibartta, 15,566 members; and next, the Chand\u00e1l, 9892; the Hari, 6999; and the Sunr\u00ed, with 6688. The boating and fishing castes collectively are strongly represented. Hindus not recognising caste are returned at 11,314, of whom 11,101 are set down as Vaishnavs. The Brahma Sam\u00e1j is represented by a few followers in Bogra town, who assemble weekly in a meeting-house erected for the purpose. The occupations of the male inhabitants are classified in the Census report under one of the following six main divisions:\u2014(1) Professional class, including Government officials and learned professions, 6295; (2) domestic servants, keepers of lodging-houses, etc., 3583; (3) commercial class, including merchants, general dealers, carriers, etc., 6412; (4) agricultural and pastoral class, including gardeners, 186,118; (5) manufacturing, artisan, and other industrial classes, 22,512; (6) indefinite and unproductive (comprising 10,137 labourers, 27 men of rank and property without occupation, and 137,593 unspecified), 147,757.\n\nEmigration from the District is unknown.\n\nThe population is almost entirely rural, and Bogra town, with 6179 souls, is the only place with a population exceeding 5000. No tendency is observed on the part of the people towards urban life, but rather the reverse. Of the 4202 villages, 3003 are returned as containing less than two hundred inhabitants; 969 from two to five hundred; 194 from five hundred to a thousand; 32 from one to two thousand; 2 from two to three thousand; 1 from three to five thousand; and 1 from five to ten thousand.\n\nThe material condition of the people is said to have very much improved of late years, in consequence of the enhancement of prices of agricultural produce. This is due principally to better means of communication with the great commercial centres of Calcutta and Dacca, since the opening of the Eastern Bengal and Northern Bengal State Railways. The increased demand for fine rice has done much to enrich the inhabitants of the western portion of the District, whilst the rapid growth of the jute trade has done even more for those in the eastern portion. The people generally are advancing in wealth, social self-\nrespect and education; and the number of those seriously in debt, that is, in the hands of the rice lender, is few. The Collector of the District in 1872-73, while reporting on the steadily increasing prosperity of the people, remarked: 'I learn, however, that in the northern parts of the District, a small section of the population are the victims of the merciless system of usury known as adhi\u00e1ri, which, literally translated, means 50 per cent. A peasant borrows a maund of rice, undertaking to pay a maund and a half in the following year. If he fails, the maund and a half is treated as a debt bearing compound interest. In course of time he assigns the produce of his holding to the creditor, and lives on such loans as it suits the latter to advance him until he becomes a mere serf.'\n\nAgriculture, etc.\u2014Rice constitutes the staple crop throughout the District, being especially predominant in the clay tract west of the Karatoy\u00e1. The \u00e1aman or winter rice crop, grown on low lands, is estimated to furnish 65 per cent. of the total food-supply; and the \u00e1us or early crop, grown on high lands, about 30 per cent. In the Brahmaputra valley, oil-seeds are largely grown, and the cultivation of jute is on the increase. In 1872, the total area under jute was nearly 50,000 acres, chiefly in the police division Sh\u00e1ri\u00e1k\u00e1nd\u00ed. The cultivation of sugar-cane has fallen off since the early years of the present century. Leguminous plants and pulses are usually grown as a second crop in the east of the District after the rice harvest. The other crops, which include wheat, barley, g\u00e1nj\u00e1, and mulberry, are insignificant. The principle of the rotation of crops is not practised, but fields are occasionally allowed to lie waste, and jute is never sown on the same land for more than three consecutive years. There is a considerable extent of waste land in most parts of the District, which is now in process of being reclaimed by hillmen from Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur. River and tank water are both largely taken advantage of for irrigation purposes in the higher lands in the west of the District; but in the eastern tracts, the annual floods of the Brahmaputra afford sufficient moisture to the soil, even when the rainfall is scanty. The rate of rent for rice land varies from rs. 6d. to 12s. per acre. Special crops, such as mulberry, g\u00e1nj\u00e1, and p\u00e1n, pay exceptional rates. The total amount received by the zam\u00edn\u00e1rs under the name of rent is almost universally augmented by the exaction of \u00e1bw\u00e1bs or customary cesses. There is little that is peculiar in the land tenures of Bogr\u00e1. At the time of the Permanent Settlement the greater part of the District was in the hands of three families, the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Din\u00e1jpur, the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Nattor, and the Muhammadan zam\u00edn\u00e1rd of Silbars\u00e1. Considerable portions have at one time or another been severed from the revenue-paying estates, and are now held as l\u00e1khir\u00e1j. Old Musalm\u00e1n endowments of this kind are particularly numerous.\nThe ordinary rates of wages, and also the prices of food-grains, have approximately doubled of late. In 1871, coolies and agricultural day-labourers received a little more than 4d. a day; smiths and carpenters, about 8d. In the same year, common rice sold at 4s. per cwt. In 1881, as the result of an unusually abundant harvest, the price of common rice fell to 3s. 4d. a cwt., or about 3s. a cwt. below the average of the three previous years. The highest price reached by rice during the scarcity of 1874 was 17s. per cwt., which was recorded in the month of July.\n\nBogr\u00e1 is liable, to some extent, to the calamity of drought; but a general destruction of the crops from floods is unknown. In 1866, the year of the Orissa famine, the local supply fell short, and not a little distress was caused by the concurrent increase of the exports to other Districts. In 1874, the failure of the rice crop was more severe, but actual suffering was anticipated by the prompt intervention of Government. More than 8000 tons of food-grain were imported from Calcutta and Go\u00e1land\u00e1; and \u00a350,000 in all was expended in relief. Since the opening of the Northern Bengal State Railway, and the completion of a system of minor roads to serve as feeders, every part of Bogr\u00e1 is now sufficiently provided with means of communication to prevent a local scarcity from intensifying into famine.\n\nManufactures, etc.\u2014The growth and preparation of indigo, which formerly attracted a large amount of European capital, has now entirely disappeared from the District. The industry of silk-spinning still lingers in the neighbourhood of Bogr\u00e1 town, but most of the other filatures have been closed, being unable to compete with the Chinese and Mediterranean producers. The manufacture of a coarse paper from jute is conducted in a few villages. The East India Company is said to have established its silk factories at Sherpur and Nand\u00e1p\u00e1r\u00e1 in this District, in the first decade of this century, and to have annually distributed \u00a350,000 in the shape of advances to the rearers of cocoons. The Company abandoned manufacture on its own account in 1834.\n\nRiver traffic is brisk in all parts of the District. The chief exports are\u2014rice, jute, mustard-seed, sugar, hides, tobacco, and g\u00e1nj\u00e1. The imports are\u2014salt, piece-goods, pulses, spices, brass ware, cocoa-nuts, and betel-nuts. The principal marts are\u2014Hill\u00ed, Damdam\u00e1, Jam\u00e1lganj, B\u00e1libh\u00e1r\u00e1, Naugi\u00f3n, and Dub\u00e1lh\u00e1t\u00ed, on the Jamun\u00e1 river; Gobindganj, Fakirganj, Gum\u00e1n\u00edganj, S\u00edbganj, Sult\u00e1nganj, and Sherpur, on the Karatoy\u00e1; Dh\u00fapch\u00e1nch\u00ed\u00e1 on the N\u00e1g\u00e1r. Some of these are situated just beyond the District boundaries, but the business of all is chiefly concerned with Bogr\u00e1 produce. According to the registration returns for the year 1876-77 (the latest date for which I have information), the total exports from the District were valued at \u00a3247,479; the imports at \u00a385,990. In addition, it is supposed that\na large portion of the Bogr\u00e1 trade, especially in the case of imports, is credited to the neighbouring Districts of Pabn\u00e1 and R\u00e1jsh\u00e1h\u00ed. The chief exports were\u2014rice, 584,000 maunds, and paddy, 46,100 maunds, valued together at \u00a3121,400; jute, 266,900 maunds, valued at \u00a380,070. The imports comprised piece-goods (\u00a335,190) and salt (39,800 maunds, valued at \u00a319,900). The single mart of Hill\u00ed, which deals almost exclusively with Calcutta and Chandarnagar, despatched just one-third in value of the exports, including 359,600 maunds of rice. Next come Dh\u00fapch\u00e1nch\u00eda, with an export of 62,300 maunds of rice; Mathur\u00e1p\u00e1r\u00e1, which exported 51,000 maunds of jute; Diw\u00e1ntol\u00e1, 42,500 maunds; Maurechar, 36,900 maunds; Gos\u00e1inb\u00e1r\u00ed, 28,300 maunds. Of the imports of piece-goods, Bogr\u00e1 town alone received \u00a323,680. In 1881, the export of rice from Bogra District amounted to 1,400,000 maunds.\n\nThe Northern Bengal State Railway runs through Bogr\u00e1 District for a distance of 39 miles. Advantage was taken of the famine relief operations in 1874 to construct a system of minor roads to serve as feeders to the railway. These roads, which have an average width of 16 feet, are 15 in number, with an aggregate length of 137 miles. The total cost was about \u00a330,000. Not a single road in the District is metalled. The chief means of communication are the natural watercourses, by which every village can be approached during the rainy season.\n\nAdministration.\u2014In 1870-71, the net revenue of Bogr\u00e1 District amounted to \u00a360,639, towards which the land-tax contributed \u00a343,981, or 70 per cent.; the net expenditure was \u00a314,857, or about one-quarter of the revenue. In 1881-82, the total revenue amounted to \u00a364,238, of which \u00a346,328, or 72\u00b712 per cent., was derived from the land revenue. In the same year there was one covenanted officer stationed in the District, 5 magisterial courts open, and three Benches of 15 honorary magistrates. For police purposes the District is divided into 8 th\u00e1n\u00e1s or police circles, with three outposts. In 1881, the regular police force numbered 230 men of all ranks, maintained at a total cost of \u00a34650. In addition, there was a municipal police of 32 officers and men, maintained at a cost of \u00a3286, and a rural police or village watch of 1864 men, maintained by the villagers and landholders. The total machinery, therefore, for the protection of person and property consisted of 2126 officers and men, giving 1 man to every 70 square mile of area, or to every 345 in the population. The District jail at Bogr\u00e1 town contained in 1881 a daily average of 184 prisoners.\n\nEducation has widely spread of recent years, chiefly owing to the changes by which grants-in-aid were assigned, first to the middle-class vernacular schools, and afterwards to the village schools or p\u00e1th\u00e1s\u00e1lds.\nIn 1856, there were only 8 inspected schools in the District, attended by 593 pupils. In 1870, the numbers had increased to 29 schools and 1221 pupils; and in 1881-82, to 127, with 3540 pupils. This is exclusive of uninspected indigenous schools; and the Census Report in 1881 returned 14,795 boys and 1044 girls as under instruction, besides 26,405 other males and 1951 females as able to read and write, but not under instruction. The higher class English school at Bogr\u00e1 town was attended in 1881-82 by 223 pupils.\n\nThe sub-divisional system has not been extended to Bogr\u00e1 District. There are 32 parganas or Fiscal Divisions, with an aggregate of 656 revenue-paying estates. In 1881, there were 2 civil judges and 5 stipendiary magistrates. The two municipalities of Bogr\u00e1 town and Sherpur contain together a total population of 10,175. In 1881-82, their aggregate municipal income was \u00a3832, the average rate of taxation being 1s. 3\u00bdd. per head.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate of Bogr\u00e1 is somewhat less hot than that of the Districts farther to the west. It has been observed that the wind, when blowing from the east, is perceptibly cooled by passing over the wide stream of the Brahmaputra. The average mean temperature is 78\u00b077 F. The average annual rainfall for a period of 20 years ending in 1881, was 80\u00b722 inches; but in 1873, only 36\u00b764 inches fell, a deficiency which caused the scarcity of the following year. In 1881, the rainfall was 70\u00b774 inches, or 9\u00b748 inches below the average.\n\nThe prevailing diseases are fevers and bowel complaints of various kinds. Cholera is said to be endemic towards the south-west of the District, which is not far from the Chalan bil; and this disease occasionally breaks out with extreme epidemic severity. Small-pox has been checked in recent years by the increasing popularity of vaccination, especially among the Muhammadans. Goitre is reported to be prevalent in the tract where jute is grown and steeped. The vital statistics show a registered number of 15,349 deaths in 1881, or a rate of 24\u00b701 per thousand. There were, in 1882, three charitable dispensaries in the District, at which 8119 in-door and out-door patients were treated during the year. [For further particulars regarding Bogr\u00e1 District, see my Statistical Account of Bengal, vol. viii. pp. 129 to 317 (Tr\u00fcbner & Co., London, 1876); see also the Bengal Census Report for 1881, and the Annual Provincial Administration Reports from 1880 to 1883.]\n\nBogr\u00e1 (Bagur\u00e1).\u2014Chief town and administrative head-quarters of Bogr\u00e1 District, Bengal; situated on the west bank of the Karatoy\u00e1 river. Lat. 24\u00b0 50' 45\" N., long. 89\u00b0 25' 50\" E. Population (1881) 6179, namely, 2667 Hindus, 3463 Muhammadans, and 49 'others.' Municipal income in 1881-82, \u00a3483; incidence of municipal taxation, 1s. 6\u00bdd. per head of population within municipal limits. The town has\nno interesting buildings; there are two markets, known as the K\u00e1lital\u00e1 and M\u00e1lthinagar h\u0101ts.\n\n**Bok\u00e1ro.\u2014** Coal-field in Haz\u00e1rib\u00e1gh District, Bengal; lies between 23\u00b0 40' and 23\u00b0 50' N. lat., and between 85\u00b0 30' and 86\u00b0 10' E. long., covering an area of 220 square miles; greatest length from east to west, 40 miles; maximum breadth from north to south, 6\u00bd miles. It takes its name from the river Bok\u00e1ro, which flows through the field for a distance of 27 miles. The coal series represented are the T\u00e1lcher, D\u00e1modar, and P\u00e1nchet; the amount of available fuel has been estimated at 1500 millions of tons. Coal has of late years been regularly cut near the villages of Charh\u00ed, Phusro, Tapin-Pindra, and Bangahr\u00e1, to supply fuel for burning bricks in Haz\u00e1rib\u00e1gh, and some has been carted to Gay\u00e1. Bok\u00e1ro stands third in order of importance among the fields of the D\u00e1modar valley which have already been examined and reported on.\n\n**Bolan.\u2014** Pass leading over the Brahu\u00ed Mountains, from the plains of Kachhi to the highlands of Saraw\u00e1n and Bal\u00fachist\u00e1n. It commences in lat. 29\u00b0 30' N., long. 67\u00b0 40' E., about 5 miles north-west of D\u00e1dar, and rises in a succession of narrow valleys between high ranges, having a north-westerly course, until it culminates in a broad plain called the Dasht-i-Bedaulat. The total length of the pass is about 60 miles; elevation of the top, about 5800 feet; average ascent, 90 feet in the mile. From the foot of the pass the halting-places are\u2014Khundil\u00e1ni, 7 miles south; Kirta, 5 miles; Bibi-N\u00e1ni, 13\u00bd miles; Ab-i-gum, 14 miles; Sar-i-Bolan, 6 miles; and from Sar-i-Bolan to the top of the pass, Dasht-i-Bedaulat, the distance is 11\u00be miles. The Bolan river, a hill torrent rising beyond Sar-i-Bolan, flows through the whole length of the pass, and is frequently crossed in the first march from the foot. This torrent is, like all mountain streams, subject to sudden floods. In 1841, a British detachment was lost with its baggage in such a flood. When the river is not swollen, however, artillery can be conveyed through without any serious difficulty; and the pass is consequently of great importance from a military point of view. In 1839, a Bengal column with its artillery, consisting of 8-inch mortars, 24-pound howitzers, and 18-pounder guns, went through the Bolan in six days. At two principal points the pass is very narrow\u2014namely, just above Khundil\u00e1ni, and beyond Sar-i-Bolan; at these places it might be held by a very small force against immensely superior numbers. At the first-mentioned point, the cliffs of conglomerate on either side rise to a height of from 400 to 800 feet, and when the river is in flood, the stream completely fills the narrow gorge; at the other point, the rocks are of limestone, and the passage is so narrow that only three or four men can ride abreast. The temperature in the pass during May is very high; water is abundant and good, but firewood is scarcely pro-\n\nVOL. III.\ncurable. There is little or no cultivation owing to the stony nature of the ground, and the route being infested by the Marri and K\u00e1k\u00e1r tribes of Bal\u00fachis and Path\u00e1ns, who, until very recently, lived principally by plundering caravans proceeding from Khor\u00e1s\u00e1n to Sind, and deterred peaceably-disposed tribes from settling in the valleys. From B\u00edbi-N\u00e1n\u00ed a mountain road leads to Khel\u00e1t, via Bar\u00e1di, Rodbar, Nurmah Takhi, and Kishan; distance, 110 miles. Distance from top of pass to Quetta, 25 miles; road good.\n\n**Bol\u00e1ram.**\u2014Military cantonment in Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d (Hyder\u00e1b\u00e1d), the Niz\u00e1m's Dominions; situated in lat. $17\u00b0\\ 32'N.$, long. $78\u00b0\\ 34'E.$, on a piece of high ground 6 or 8 miles in circumference, having on its summit an open plain extending east of the cantonment. Elevation above sea, 1890 feet; distance from Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d (Hyder\u00e1b\u00e1d), 11 miles north, and from Sikandar\u00e1b\u00e1d (Secunder\u00e1b\u00e1d), 6 miles north. The troops stationed here belong to the Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d Contingent. The place is healthy. Several kinds of English vegetables and fruits thrive well. A disturbance occurred among the men of one of the Niz\u00e1m's cavalry regiments stationed here in 1855, and Brigadier Colin Mackenzie was severely wounded.\n\n**Bolpur.**\u2014Village in B\u00edrbh\u00fam District, Bengal, and a station on the East Indian Railway; distance from Calcutta (Howrah), 99 miles. Since the opening of the railway, the village has risen rapidly in importance, and is now a considerable place of trade.\n\n**Bol\u00fandra.**\u2014Petty State in the M\u00e1hi K\u00e1ntha Agency, Bombay Presidency. The Th\u00e1kur is a Rewar R\u00e1jput, descended from a younger branch of the Ran\u00e1san family; he has no sanad authorizing adoption; the family follows the rule of primogeniture. The first Th\u00e1kur of Bol\u00fandra obtained the estate as a maintenance in 1724 A.D. The land under cultivation is estimated at 5200 bighas. Population (1881) 875; revenue, \u00a361; tribute of about \u00a314 is paid to the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 of Edar.\n\n**Bomanahilli.**\u2014Village in Bell\u00e1ry District, Madras Presidency, which gives its name to a great irrigational project, designed\u2014by the construction of a reservoir and channels\u2014to irrigate about 64,000 acres of land.\n\n**Bombadi.**\u2014Township in British Burma.\u2014See BUMAWADI.\n\n**Bombay Presidency.**\u2014Bombay, the Western Presidency of British India, is divided into four revenue Divisions and twenty-four British Districts. It also includes numerous Native States, under the protection of Her Majesty's Indian Government. The territory thus composed extends from $13\u00b0\\ 53'$ to $28\u00b0\\ 45'$ N. lat., and from $66\u00b0\\ 40'$ to $76\u00b0\\ 30'$ E. long. The British Districts, including Sind, contain a total area of 124,123 square miles, and a total population (according to the Census of 1881) of 16,489,274 souls; the Native States under the Bombay\nGovernment, excluding Baroda, cover an additional area estimated at 73,753 square miles, with a population of 6,941,249 souls; grand total area, 197,876 square miles; grand total population, 23,430,523 souls. The State of Baroda, with an estimated area of 8570 square miles, and a population of 2,185,005 souls, although in direct subordination to the Supreme Government of India, is intricately interlaced with the Bombay British Districts, and may, from a geographical point of view, be regarded as forming part of the Bombay Presidency. The Portuguese possessions of Goa, Dam\u00e1n, and Diu, with an aggregate area of about 3806 square kilometres, and population (1881) of 475,172 souls, are also included within its geographical limits. The capital of the Presidency, the residence of the Governor, and the head-quarters of all the administrative departments, is BOMBAY CITY, situated on an island of the same name on the shore of the Arabian Sea, in 18\u00b0 55' 5\" N. latitude, and 72\u00b0 53' 55\" E. longitude.\n\n**Boundaries.**\u2014Bombay Presidency is bounded on the north-west, north, and north-east by Bal\u00fachist\u00e1n and Kh\u00e9l\u00e1t, the British Province of the Punjab, and the Native States of R\u00e1jput\u00e1n\u00e1; on the east by the Native States of the Central India Agency, the Central Provinces, West Ber\u00e1r, and the Dominions of the Niz\u00e1m of Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d; on the south by the Presidency of Madras and the State of Mysore; and on the west by the Arabian Sea.\n\n**History.**\u2014The territory included within the Bombay Presidency was in old times partitioned among many independent kingdoms. The most ancient records and memorials, such as the inscribed rock of Girn\u00e1r and the caves of Ajanta, carry us back to the period before and at the commencement of the Christian era, when Buddhism was the orthodox creed throughout the peninsula of India. A survival of this early faith is represented by the Jains, who are still an influential sect in the Bombay Presidency, adhering with tenacity to their ancient traditions. The names of the most ancient Hindu kingdoms which can be localized in Western India are\u2014MAHARASHTRA, the present Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 country, which is interpreted to mean either \u2018the great country\u2019 or \u2018the country of the aboriginal tribe of Mahars;\u2019 Gujar\u00e1shtra, or the modern Guj\u00e1r\u00e1t (Guzerat), \u2018the country of the Guj\u00e1rs,\u2019 including the peninsula of KATHIAWAR, which was once the head-quarters of a great kingdom known as Saur\u00e1shtra, or the country of the Saur\u00e1s;\u2019 and lastly, Sindhu or SIND, which is emphatically the land of the Indus river. A succession of dynasties, of R\u00e1jput origin, ruled over these regions during the first ten centuries of the Christian era. The most powerful seem to have been, the dynasty which had its capital at Walabh\u00ed, in the modern Gohelw\u00e1r; and the Ch\u00e1l\u00fakya empire of the Deccan (Dakshin). Our knowledge of this period is chiefly derived from coins and charters on stone and copper, which have been found\nin great abundance in certain localities. Continuous history begins with the invasion of the Musalm\u00e1ns.\n\nSind was the first part of India in which the Muhammadans established a footing. But the best known event in this period of history is the invasion of Gujar\u00e1t (Guzerat) by M\u00e1hm\u00fad of Ghazn\u00ed, in 1024, when the sacred temple of Somn\u00e1th was sacked and an immense booty carried away by the invader. Henceforth the R\u00e1jput dynasty of Gujar\u00e1t, whose capital was at Anhilw\u00e1r\u00e1 or Patan, defended themselves with varying success against successive waves of invasion, until their kingdom was finally destroyed in 1297 by Alaf Kh\u00e1n, the general of the T\u00farki Emperor of Delhi, Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn Khilj\u00ed. For about a century, from 1297 to 1403, Gujar\u00e1t was governed by deputies sent from Delhi. The last of these governors, J\u00e1far Kh\u00e1n, a R\u00e1jput renegade, threw off his allegiance to the Emperor, and founded an independent dynasty known as the Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d kingdom, from the capital built in 1413 by Ahmad I. This dynasty attained to great power and splendour, as is testified both by the reports of European travellers and by the ruined buildings still existing at Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d and Champ\u00e1ner. Its annual revenue is said to have amounted to 11 millions sterling. In 1573, Gujar\u00e1t was conquered by the Mughal Emperor, Akbar, who led the invading army in person, and the Province was again subjected to the control of Viceroys from Delhi. During the 17th century, Muhammadan authority was maintained despite the rising power of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s in the south of the Province. But on the death of Aurangzeb in 1707, all show of order was swept away; and in 1757 the Province of Gujar\u00e1t, with its capital, Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d, was finally surrendered to the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, under the joint leadership of a deputy of the Peshwa and Dam\u00e1ji G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r.\n\nThe Deccan (Dakshin) was first conquered by the Muhammadans in 1294\u201395, although the difficult nature of the hill tracts, and dissensions among the invaders, long prevented the subjugation from being complete. In 1345, the weakness of Muhammad Tughlak, the T\u00farki Emperor of Delhi, encouraged Ahmad Sh\u00e1h B\u00e1hmani to rise in rebellion and to found an independent dynasty called after his own name. Its capital was first at G\u00falbarga, but was subsequently removed to B\u00edd\u00e1r. About 1490, the B\u00e1hmani kingdom fell to pieces, being partitioned among the feudatory nobles, of whom the two greatest founded the dynasties of Bij\u00e1pur and Ahmadnagar. Towards the close of the 16th century, the Mughal Emperors of Delhi began to press upon these independent kingdoms from the north; and the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 horsemen, under Sivaji, found their opportunity in the continual dissensions of the Musalm\u00e1ns. In 1637, the Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1hi dynasty of Ahmadnagar was finally overthrown, and its territory divided between the Mughals and the Bij\u00e1pur kings. In 1684, Bij\u00e1pur was itself taken by the Emperor Aurangzeb,\nand the Mughals and the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s were left face to face. The great Sivaji was born in 1627. He rose to power by availing himself of the hill fastnesses of the Gh\u00e1ts, organizing the sturdy Hindu peasantry into a military confederacy, and alternately playing off the Musalm\u00e1ns of Bij\u00e1pur and Delhi against each other. In 1674, he ventured to declare his independence openly by being crowned at Raigarah, and six years afterwards he died. His lineal successors, the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Sat\u00e1ra, did not inherit his genius for command; but the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 traditions were maintained by subordinate officials and generals, who carved out for themselves kingdoms in all parts of the peninsula, and only lost the supreme empire of India by their defeat at the hands of the Afgh\u00e1ns at P\u00e1nipat.\n\nThe most important members of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 confederacy who played a part in the history of Bombay, were,\u2014the Peshwa, or over-lord, the hereditary mayor of the palace to the effete descendants of Sivaj\u00ed, who may be said to have established his practical supremacy in 1749, with Poona (P\u00fana) for his capital; and the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda. These two chiefs collected tribute during the 18th century from the greater part of what is now the Presidency of Bombay. For the further development of the five great Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 houses, see post, article INDIA.\n\nThe first European nation who had dealings with the west coast of India was the Portuguese. In 1498, Vasco da Gama landed at Calicut; five years later, the great Albuquerque conquered Goa; and as early as 1532, the Portuguese are found in occupation of the island of Bombay. For a hundred years they maintained their monopoly of the Eastern trade. The first English ship is said to have arrived at Surat, then the chief emporium of Indian commerce, in 1608. Shortly afterwards the English merchants fought a sea-battle with the Portuguese off Surat, and, as a result of their victory, obtained a charter from the Delhi Emperor Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr in 1613, entitling them to establish a factory in that city. The Dutch received a similar authorization in 1618. Bombay island, comprising the present BOMBAY CITY, was ceded to the English Crown in 1661, as part of the dower of the Infanta Catharina on her marriage with Charles II. A British fleet was sent out under the Earl of Marlborough to take possession of the island. But a dispute arose with the Portuguese governor; and in 1668, the king was glad to hand over his unprofitable acquisition, at that time considered as the grave of Europeans, to the East India Company, on payment of an annual rent of \u00a310 in gold. The total revenue was estimated at 75,000 xeraphins, or about \u00a36500, paid by a population of about 10,000 souls. The Company forthwith adopted measures to strengthen the fortifications, attract European settlers, and encourage manufactures and commerce. In 1687, the chief control of all the Company\u2019s possessions in India was transferred from Surat to Bombay, which was erected into an independent Presidency in 1708, on the amalgamation of the two rival\nEnglish Companies trading with India. Finally, in 1773, Bombay was placed in a position of qualified subordination to the Governor-General at Calcutta.\n\nFor more than a century the position of the English on the west coast of India was merely that of traders, who had successfully infringed the monopoly of the Portuguese and the Dutch, but were hemmed in on the landward side by the rising power of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. The first of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 chiefs with whom our countrymen at Bombay city came into serious collision was Angria, who, from his stronghold on the island of Kol\u00e1ba, dominated the entire coast of the Konkan with a numerous piratical fleet. In 1756, the Governor of Bombay, in alliance with the Peshw\u00e1, despatched an expedition by sea, which captured Angria's fortified harbour of Savarindr\u00fag; and in the same year an expedition sent from England, under the joint command of Admiral Watson and the celebrated Clive, stormed Gheri\u00e1 or Viziarindr\u00fag, and won a booty of \u00a3100,000. The power of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 pirates was thus broken, but the only territorial acquisition made by the English, was a few villages on the mainland south of Bombay. In 1774, the Bombay Government commenced the first Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 war, on the occasion of a disputed succession to the title of Peshw\u00e1. This war was marked by the inglorious convention of Warg\u00e1on (1779), and the repulse of General Goddard at the foot of the Bhor-Gh\u00e1t. It was terminated by the treaty of S\u00e1lbai (1782); in accordance with which the English retained permanent possession of Salsette, Elephanta, Karanja and Hog Island, but gave back Bassein and all their conquests in Gujar\u00e1t to the Peshw\u00e1, and made over Broach to Sindhia. The castle of Surat had been in British hands since 1759; and in 1800, the entire administration of that city was transferred to them by the Muhamm:adan Naw\u00e1b, whose descendants retained the empty title until 1842.\n\nThe second Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 war was occasioned by the treaty of Bassein in 1802, by which the Peshw\u00e1 accepted the subsidiary system that formed the keynote to the Marquis of Wellesley's policy. The northern Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 houses combined to break down this treaty, and the military operations known as the second Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 war followed (1803-04). As the result of that war, a considerable tract in Gujar\u00e1t, including the present Districts of Surat, Broach, and Kaira, was ceded to the British, and their political influence became predominant at the courts of Poona and Baroda. During the interval of peace which followed, measures were taken for destroying the haunts of the pirates who then infested the gulfs of Cambay and Cutch (Kachchh). In 1807, the States of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r were taken under British protection, and in 1809 the R\u00e1o of Cutch was induced to sign a treaty promising to co-operate in the suppression of piracy. But no sooner had the Peshw\u00e1, B\u00e1j\u00ed R\u00e1o, been restored to his throne at Poona by a British army, than he began to plot\nfor the expulsion of the British from the Deccan. At last, in 1817, he suddenly attacked the Resident, Mr. Elphinstone, who retired to Kirki, where a small British force was stationed, which a few days afterwards utterly defeated the whole army of the Peshw\u00e1. After a few more engagements, the fugitive Peshw\u00e1 surrendered to Sir John Malcolm. A pension of \u00a380,000 was guaranteed to him for life, but he was deprived of all his dominions. By these measures the Bombay Presidency was augmented by the annexation of the Districts of Poona, Ahmadnagar, N\u00e1sik, Shol\u00e1pur, Belg\u00e1um, Kal\u00e1dgi, Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r, Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d, and the Konkan; thus receiving at one time the greater part of its present territory. At the same date, Holkar made over his rights in Kh\u00e1ndesh District to the British. Sat\u00e1ra lapsed to the paramount power in 1848, on the death of the last lineal descendant of Sivaj\u00ed without a natural heir; the non-regulation tracts of the P\u00e1nch Mah\u00e1ls were ceded by Sindhia in 1860; and in 1861 the southern limits of the Presidency were extended by the transfer of the District of North K\u00e1nara from Madras.\n\nThe history of Sind forms a chapter apart from that of the rest of the Presidency. Shortly after the beginning of the present century, the Government of that country was assumed by four brothers of Bal\u00fach\u00ed origin, known as the Talpur Am\u00edrs. The advance of the British power, and especially the right of passage up the Indus at the time of the Afgh\u00e1n war, caused complications with the Am\u00edrs of Sind. Hostilities were precipitated by an attack upon the British Residency at Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d, and the war that followed was signalized by the decisive victory of M\u00ed\u00e1n\u00ed (Meeanee). The Province was annexed to the British Empire in 1843, and the conquering general, Sir Charles Napier, was appointed its first ruler. Sind continues to be administered as a non-regulation Province. A proposal has been under consideration to detach it from Bombay, and to place it, together with the frontier Districts of the Punjab, immediately under the Supreme Government of India.\n\nThe recent history of Bombay Presidency is destitute of stirring incidents. Peace has remained unbroken, even during the troublous season of 1857, when the Bombay troops remained, as a body, loyal. The local army has done good service in many climes. In Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n and Persia, in Burma and China, in Aden and Abyssinia, the Sepoys of Bombay have shown themselves willing to do their duty wheresoever called. But the chief glory of British administration has lain in the development of the arts of peace. Instead of the chronic disorder of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 period, absolute security is now guaranteed to life and property. Where bands of irregular horsemen formerly collected tribute from the villagers at the spear\u2019s point, the land revenue is now realized by the operation of law, in amounts larger than could be conceived in the days of military extortion. The rail-\nway, a triumph of engineering skill, climbs with ease the famous Bhor-Gh\u00e1t, which in old times shut off the fertile plateau of the Deccan from the sea-coast, and once witnessed the discomfiture of a British army. A series of administrative reforms, originated by Mountstuart Elphinstone, Governor of Bombay from 1819 to 1827, have been continued and developed by the subsequent succession of rulers; and the benefits of civilisation have been widely distributed through the land. The cultivator is no longer a tenant-at-will of the State, liable to unlimited exactions of revenue; his position is now that of a part owner of the soil, with rights which he can transmit by sale or descent, subject only to the payment of a rent-charge fixed for a term of years. At the same time, the ambition of the upper classes has been turned into the peaceful channels of commerce. The growth of the trade in cotton is at once the cause and the measure of the advance in the average standard of comfort. Wide Districts in Gujar\u00e1t and the Deccan have found their advantage in cultivating a staple which for a short season brought them a golden return, and still pays better than the ordinary grain crops. Bombay city bears witness by her splendid buildings, her docks, and her public works, to the prosperity of the land over which she rules, and from which she draws a rich tribute.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The Presidency of Bombay presents on the map the appearance of an irregular strip of land, stretching along the eastern shore of the Arabian Sea, and extending up the lower portion of the Indus valley. The continuous coast-line is only broken towards the north by the gulfs of Cambay and Cutch, between which lies the projecting peninsula of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r. The seaboard is generally rock-bound and difficult of access, although it contains many little estuaries forming fair-weather ports for vessels engaged in the coasting trade. Bombay and K\u00e1rw\u00e1r alone have harbours sufficiently landlocked to protect shipping during the prevalence of the south-west monsoon.\n\nPhysically as well as historically, Bombay Presidency may be roughly divided into two distinct portions, the Narbad\u00e1 (Nerbudda) forming the boundary line. To the north of that river lie the Province of Gujar\u00e1t, with the peninsulas of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r and Cutch, and the Province of Sind; to the south the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 country, part of the Deccan, the K\u00e1rnatic, and the Konkan. The former of these tracts is for the most part a low plain of alluvial origin. In Southern Gujar\u00e1t the valleys of the T\u00e1pt\u00ed and Narbad\u00e1 form sheets of unbroken cultivation. But in Northern Gujar\u00e1t the soil becomes sandy and the rainfall deficient; cultivation is largely dependent upon either artificial irrigation or the natural humidity caused by the neighbourhood of the ocean. In Sind (beyond the delta on the east), the surface is a wide expanse of desert, interrupted only by low cliffs or undulating sand-heaps. The geological formation is distinct from that of the rest of\nthe Indian peninsula, consisting of limestone rocks, continuous with those found in Persia and Arabia.\n\nBombay, south of the Narbad\u00e1, consists of a level coast strip, rising into an upland country. Mountains furrowed by deep valleys intercept the rain-clouds of the monsoons, and blossom with tropical vegetation. The geological formation is composed of nearly horizontal strata of basalt and similar rocks, which naturally break into steep terraces and hog-backed ridges, and have produced by their decomposition the famous 'black cotton soil,' unsurpassed for its fertility. Perched upon these rugged eminences stand the impregnable hill forts famous in Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 history. The Deccan, the K\u00e1rnatic, and the Konkan are each marked by special features of their own. The Deccan, including Kh\u00e1ndesh District, is an elevated plateau behind the Western Gh\u00e1ts. It is drained by several large rivers, along whose banks are tracts of great fertility; but for the rest, the air is dry and the rainfall uncertain. The K\u00e1rnatic, or country south of the Krishna (Kistna) river, is a plain of lower elevation, and contains wide expanses of black soil under continuous cultivation. The Konkan is the name of the narrow strip of land lying between the base of the Gh\u00e1ts and the sea. As a whole, it is a rugged and difficult country, intersected by numerous creeks, and abounding in isolated peaks and detached ranges of hills. The cultivation consists only of a few rich plots of rice-land and groves of cocoa-nut. The rainfall is excessive. The Districts of the Presidency are classified as follows, with reference to the natural divisions above described:\n\nSind Districts.\u2014Kar\u00e1chi (Kurrachee), Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d, Shik\u00e1rpur, Thar and P\u00e1rkar, and Upper Sind Frontier, forming the Sind Division.\n\nGujarat Districts.\u2014Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d, Kaira, P\u00e1nch-Mah\u00e1ls, Broach, and Surat.\n\nKonkan Districts.\u2014Th\u00e1na, Bombay city and island, Kol\u00e1ba, Ratnagiri, and K\u00e1nara.\n\nDeccan Districts.\u2014Kh\u00e1ndesh, Nasik, Ahmadnagar, Poona (P\u00fana), Shol\u00e1pur, and Sat\u00e1ra.\n\nWestern K\u00e1rnatic or South Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 Districts.\u2014Belg\u00e1um, Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r, and Kal\u00e1dgi.\n\nMountains.\u2014The following are the chief mountain ranges, which all have a general direction from north to south. In the north-west, on the right bank of the Indus, the H\u00e1la and Khirt\u00e1ri mountains, a continuation of the great Sulaim\u00e1n range, separate British India from the domains of the Kh\u00e1n of Khel\u00e1t. In Sind there are low ranges of sandhills, and in Cutch and K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r several isolated peaks and cliffs, which form geologically a continuation of the Ar\u00e1valli mountains. Proceeding towards the south-east, an extensive mountain chain is met with, which may be regarded either as a southern spur of the Ar\u00e1valli mountains, or a northern prolongation of the Western Gh\u00e1ts beyond\nthe valleys of the T\u00e1pt\u00ed and Narbad\u00e1. These hills separate Gujar\u00e1t from the States of Central India, beginning in the neighbourhood of Mount Ab\u00fa, and stretching southwards down to the right bank of the Narbad\u00e1. South of the T\u00e1pt\u00ed the country becomes rugged and broken, with isolated masses of rock and projecting spurs, forming the watershed for the great rivers of the Deccan. This rugged region constitutes, strictly speaking, the northern extremity of the Western Gh\u00e1ts, here called the Sahy\u00e1dri Hills. That great range runs southward, parallel to the sea-coast for upwards of 500 miles, with a general elevation of about 1800 feet above the sea, though individual peaks rise to more than double that height. The western declivity is abrupt, and the low strip of land bordering the sea-shore is seldom more than 40 miles in width. The Gh\u00e1ts do not descend in one sheer precipice, but, as is usually the case with a trap formation, the descent is broken by a succession of terraces. The landward slope is gentle, also falling in terraces, the crest of the range being in many cases but slightly raised above the level of the central plateau of the Deccan. Apart from many minor spurs of the Western Gh\u00e1ts, only two ranges in the Presidency have a direction from east to west. The S\u00e1tpura range, from the neighbourhood of the fort of As\u00edrgarh to its termination in the east of Gujar\u00e1t, forms the watershed between the T\u00e1pt\u00ed and Narbad\u00e1 rivers, separating Kh\u00e1ndesh District from the territories of Indore, and attaining an elevation of over 5000 feet. The S\u00e1tm\u00e1la or Ajanta Hills, which divide Kh\u00e1ndesh from the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s Dominions on the south, are of less importance, being rather the northern slope of the plateau of the Deccan than a distinct hill range.\n\n**Rivers.**\u2014Bombay Presidency has no great rivers which it can call its own. The outlying Province of Sind is penetrated throughout its entire length from north to south by the Indus, whose overflowing waters are almost the sole means of distributing fertility through that parched region. Its season of flood begins in March and continues until September; the discharge of water, calculated at 40,857 cubic feet per second in December, is said to increase tenfold in August, the average depth of the river increasing during the inundation from 9 to 24 feet, and the velocity of the current increasing from 3 to 7 miles an hour. The entire lower portion of the delta is torn and furrowed by old channels of the river, for the surface is a light sand, easily swept away and re-deposited year by year. A full account of the utility of the Indus, both for irrigation and navigation, will be found in the separate article on that river. The plains of Northern Gujar\u00e1t are watered by a few small streams, the chief of which are the Sabarmati and M\u00e1hi, both rising in the M\u00e1hi K\u00e1ntha Hills and flowing southward into the head of the Gulf of Cambay. The Narbad\u00e1 in its westerly course to the sea from Central India, has but a short section within the limits of the Presidency. It\nseparates the territory of Baroda from Rew\u00e1 K\u00e1ntha, and, after passing the city of Broach, falls into the Gulf of Cambay by a noble estuary. For about 100 miles from the sea it is navigable at all seasons by country boats, and during the rains by vessels of 50 tons burthen. The T\u00e1pt\u00ed, although a smaller river, has a greater commercial importance. It flows through the whole length of Kh\u00e1ndesh District, and enters the sea a little above the city of Surat. Both these rivers run for the most part between high banks, and are little used for the purposes of irrigation. Passing southwards, the hill streams which rise in the Western Gh\u00e1ts and flow west into the Arabian Sea are very numerous, but of little importance. During the rains they become formidable torrents, but in the hot season they dwindle away and almost cease to flow. In the low lands of the Konkan their annual floods have worn deep tidal creeks, which form valuable highways for traffic. In the extreme south of the Presidency, in the District of North K\u00e1nara, these westward-flowing streams become larger; one of them, the Shar\u00e1vati, plunges downwards from the mountains in the celebrated Falls of Gersappa. This majestic cataract consists of five cascades in the dry weather, which spring over the face of a rock 890 feet in height. During the rains, the five cascades unite into one magnificent avalanche of water.\n\nOn the eastern side of the Gh\u00e1ts are the headwaters of both the God\u00e1var\u00ed and Kistna (Krishna) rivers, the former of which rises near N\u00e1sik and the latter near Mah\u00e1baleshwar. Both of these, after collecting the waters of many tributary streams, some of considerable size, leave the Presidency in a south-easterly direction, crossing the entire plain of the Deccan on their way to the Bay of Bengal.\n\n**Bays and Lakes.**\u2014The most peculiar natural feature in the Presidency is the Rann of Cutch (Kachchh). Authorities have not yet decided whether it is an arm of the sea from which the waters have receded, or an inland lake whose seaward barrier has been swept away by some natural convulsion. It covers an estimated area of 8000 square miles, forming the western boundary of the Province of Gujar\u00e1t; but when flooded during the rainy season, it unites the two gulfs of Cutch and Cambay, and converts the peninsula of Cutch into an island. In the dry season the soil is impregnated with salt, the surface in some places being moist and marshy, and in others strewn with gravel and shingle like a dry river-bed or sea-beach. At this time the Rann is frequented by numerous herds of antelope, the \u2018black buck\u2019 of sportsmen. Large tracts of marshy land are to be found in the Province of Sind, caused by changes in the course of the Indus. The Manchhar lake, on the right bank of the river, near the town of Sehw\u00e1n, is swelled during the annual season of inundation to an area of about 160 square miles; and a large portion of the newly-formed delta has not yet been fully reclaimed from the antagonistic forces of\nthe river and the sea. Along the coast of the Konkan the low-lying lands on the borders of the salt-water creeks are liable to be overflowed at high tide. Two artificial sheets of water may for their size be dignified with the title of lakes; Veh\u00e1r tank and Tulsi lake, constructed to provide Bombay city with water. The former is situated about 16 miles distant from the city, amid a group of hills near the town of Th\u00e1na; it has an area of about 1400 acres. The latter lies three miles north of Veh\u00e1r, and about two miles south of the Kanheri caves, with an area of 331 acres. Another sheet of water, the Kharak-w\u00e1sla tank, intended to supply Poona, and also to irrigate the neighbouring fields, covers an area of 3500 acres.\n\nMinerals.\u2014Bombay Presidency is deficient in mineral wealth, although abundantly supplied with stone adapted for building and road-making. At Te\u00e1gar, or Tegur, in the District of Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r, iron-ore is mined and smelted, but the scarcity of fuel prevents operations on an extensive scale. In the same District, large slate quarries are worked. There are five valuable limestone quarries near Kar\u00e1ch\u00ed (Kurrachee), and lime is burned in Belg\u00e1um District. The bordering mountains of Baluch\u00edst\u00e1n are reported to contain large quantities of gypsum, copper, lead, antimony, and sulphur.\n\nThe Forests of Bombay belong to two separate classes\u2014the produce of the alluvial plains in Sind, and the produce of the mountains of the Western Gh\u00e1ts. The State reserves in Sind are estimated to cover an area of 375,329 acres, lying along the banks of the Indus. They are divided into blocks, locally known as bel\u00eds, which are said to have been originally formed as hunting-grounds by the Am\u00edrs, the former Muhammadan rulers of the Province. Frequent changes in the course of the river sweep away large portions of these bel\u00eds, the average annual loss from erosion being calculated at as much as 10,000 acres; and, though fresh deposits of alluvion afford some compensation, it takes many years to replace the timber-trees thus carried off. The most valuable trees are the sisu or blackwood (Dalbergia sisoo), in small plantations; bab\u00fal (Acacia arabica), which here attains a fair size; bh\u00e1n (Populus euphratica), a soft wood which grows in great abundance in Upper Sind; and tamarisk (Tamarix indica), which never attains large dimensions, but is extensively used as fuel by the river steamers. The kuw\u00e1li (Prosopis spicigera) is a very important tree in the arid tracts. The bamboo is altogether unknown in Sind, but the true date (Ph\u0153nix dactylifera) grows abundantly near Sakkar, in the upper part of the Province. In 1880\u201381, the total receipts of the Forest Department in Sind amounted to \u00a342,784, against an expenditure of \u00a329,916, showing a net profit of \u00a312,868. The work of conservancy is chiefly confined to the prevention of mischief by fire, and the planting of bab\u00fal trees.\nThe hill forests of Bombay are practically limited to the Western Gh\u00e1ts. In Gujar\u00e1t and the K\u00e1rnatic, cultivation is too widely spread; while in the Deccan and in Kh\u00e1ndesh District the atmosphere is too dry, and the rainfall too uncertain. In the northern extremity of the Gh\u00e1ts occur the tracts known as the D\u00e1ngs, which yield little besides timber; and in the extreme south, the District of North K\u00e1nara forms in its uplands one vast forest, from which half of the total forest revenue in the Presidency is derived. The woods of the Northern Konkan possess an especial value from their nearness to Bombay city. The following are the principal timber-trees in the hills:\u2014Teak (Tectona grandis), blackwood (Dalbergia latifolia), tiw\u00e1s (Oujeinia dalbergiodes), hon\u00e9 or bibl\u00e1 (Pterocarpus marsupium), ain or s\u00e1dara (Terminalia tomentosa), ebony and p\u00fan, bab\u00fal (Acacia arabica), khayer or khair (Acacia catechu), hedu (Adina cordifolia), kalam or yetgal (Stephgyne parvifolia), n\u00e1na and bonda (Lagerstroemia lanceolata), as\u00e1na (Briedelia retusa), ironwood or jamba (Xylia dolabri-formis). Sandal-wood is found only in the forests of K\u00e1nara. In 1880\u201381, the total revenue of the Forest Department in the Regulation Districts of the Bombay Presidency was \u00a3109,496; the total expenditure was \u00a381,593, leaving a profit of \u00a327,903. The sowing of teak and bab\u00fal plantations is conducted on an extensive scale. The total forest area of the northern and southern Divisions of the Presidency, in 1880\u201381, was returned at 14,300 square miles, of which 13,259 square miles are conserved.\n\nBesides timber-trees, the forests of Bombay Presidency yield other wild produce of commercial value. The fruit-trees include mango (Mangifera Indica), jack (Artocarpus integrifolia), ber (Zizyphus jujuba), and b\u00e9l (\u00c6gle marmelos), the fruit of which is a specific in dysentery. Khayer or Khair (Acacia catechu), besides supplying timber and firewood, is also the source of cutch or Terra japonica; Terminalia chebula yields the myrobalams of commerce. Und\u00ed (Callophyllum inophyllum), karanja (Pongamia glabra), and mahu\u00e1 (Bassia latifolia), all supply oil for industrial purposes. The mahu\u00e1 flowers are an important article of food, and a spirit is also distilled from them. The palms comprise the cocoa-nut (Cocos nucifera), the wild date (Phoenix sylvestris), the Palmyra palm (Borassus flabelliformis), the talipot or umbrella palm (Corypha umbraculifera), the bh\u00e9rali-m\u00e1r (Caryota urens), and the betel-nut or sup\u00e1ri (Areca catechu). The jungle tribes collect gums from several varieties of trees, and in Sind the Government derives a small revenue from the lac found on the bab\u00fal.\n\nFauna.\u2014Among the wild animals peculiar to the Presidency may be mentioned the maneless lion of Gujar\u00e1t, which zoologists are now disposed to regard as a local variety rather than a separate species; and the wild ass, frequenting the sandy deserts of Cutch and Upper Sind.\nLeopards are common, but the tiger has retreated before the advance of cultivation, and is now only found in remote jungles. The black bear (Ursus labiatus) is found wherever rocky hills and forests occur; and the bison (Gav\u00e6us gaurus) haunts the mountain glades of K\u00e1nara. Of deer, the s\u00e1mbhar (Rusa aristotelis) is found in the same localities as the bison, though in greater abundance; while the nilg\u00e1i (Portax pictus) and the antelope are so numerous, especially in Gujar\u00e1t, as to become sometimes a pest to the cultivators. Small game, such as snipe, quail, partridges, and wild duck, can generally be obtained by the sportsman in all parts of the Presidency, even within easy reach of the suburbs of Bombay. In the year 1881, the total number of registered deaths throughout the Presidency caused by wild beasts was only 120; whereas venomous snakes killed 1209 persons.\n\nConcerning domestic animals, it may be said that the cattle of Bombay Presidency are everywhere too numerous for the pasturage available. In breeding, no attention is paid to artificial selection, and the present poor condition of the animals is said to be becoming worse. In Gujar\u00e1t a class of bullocks of more than ordinary size is met with, used especially for drawing carts along the deep sandy roads of that country. Into the south of the Presidency a yet more valuable breed of draught oxen is imported from Mysore. In certain parts buffaloes are commonly used for ploughing; and throughout Sind, the camel is the one animal for all agricultural purposes. In former days the horses of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r and the Deccan were highly valued for military purposes, but both breeds have now much deteriorated. Horse shows are encouraged by the Government, and stallions, nearly all Arabs, with a few imported from England, are kept at the public expense. In the year 1880-81 the agricultural returns for the entire Presidency showed a total of 3,001,226 bullocks and 1,930,395 cows; 373,327 male and 1,020,944 female buffaloes; 45,376 horses, 49,377 mares, and 24,553 foals; 98,833 asses; and 2,805,664 sheep and goats. A considerable proportion of the asses, and also many camels, are found in the Districts of Sind.\n\nPopulation, 1854-1881.\u2014Careful estimates, published in 1854, gave the following figures for the area and population of the Bombay Presidency. Total area of the British Districts, including Sind, 120,065 square miles; total population, 11,109,067, or an average of 92'55 per square mile. Total area of Native States, 60,650 square miles; total population, 4,469,925. Grand total, 180,715 square miles and 15,578,992 inhabitants (1854). The Census of 1872, conducted throughout the British Districts on the night of 21st February, which extended to all the Native States with the exception of Baroda, disclosed a population of 16,285,636 in the British Districts, 6,801,440 in the Native States; total, 23,087,076 souls, on an area practically corresponding with the present territory. The latest Census of 1881,\ntaken on the night of the 17th February, returned a population of 16,489,274 souls for the British Districts of the Presidency, inclusive of Aden; and of 9,126,254 souls for the Native States, inclusive of Baroda; total, 25,615,528. The population of Baroda is here included for purposes of comparison with the previous Census. The State was transferred from the political control of Bombay to the Government of India in 1875. The District operations were conducted under the orders of the several Collectors. The actual enumeration was effected by the subordinate Government agency in each village, supplemented where necessary by paid labour. The total cost of the Census was \u00a320,244, or an average of about a farthing per head of the population enumerated, i.e. within British Districts.\n\n**Population, etc. of the British Districts in the Bombay Presidency, and of Aden, according to the Census of 1881.**\n\n| BRITISH DISTRICTS | Area Sq.

included in the Presidency of Bombay, with Aden and Baroda, is 206,457 square miles, and the population is 25,615,528 souls. The average density of population throughout the British Districts of the Presidency is 133 per square mile, but the pressure varies greatly in different tracts. The two most densely peopled Districts in Bombay Proper are Kaira, with 500 persons to the square mile, and Surat, with 370. The two least populous in Bombay Proper are Kal\u00e1dg\u00ed, with 111, and North K\u00e1nara, with 108. The average in the outlying Province of Sind is only 52 per square mile, falling as low as 16 in the sandy desert of Thar and P\u00e1rkar. Classified according to sex, the population of the British Districts, exclusive of Aden, is made up of 8,497,718 males and 7,956,696 females; proportion of males, 51\u00b76 per cent. This proportion of males is main-\n\n\u00b9 In 1875, the political control of the State of Baroda was transferred from Bombay to the Supreme Government of India; as it comes within the Presidency limits, it is here included.\ntained fairly uniformly throughout, except in Sind, where it rises to 54.55 per cent. The low proportion of 47.4 per cent. of males in Ratnagiri District, as compared with the high rate of 60.0 per cent. in Bombay city, is to be explained by the natural influx of male labourers from the neighbouring country to find work in the city. Classified according to age, there are, under fourteen years of age, 3,371,089 boys and 3,065,956 girls; total children, 6,437,045, or 39.1 per cent. of the entire population. The proportion of girls to total females is nearly equal to that of boys to total males. The number of persons afflicted with certain specified infirmities is thus returned: \u2014Unsound mind\u2014males 5137, and females 2617; total, 7754: deaf and dumb\u2014males 7151, and females 4706; total, 11,857: blind\u2014males 20,355, females, 23,400; total, 43,755: lepers\u2014males 7425, females 2670; total, 10,095: grand total of infirms, 73,467, or 1 in every 224 of the population. The large preponderance of males in all these classes except among the blind is noteworthy. The classification of the people according to occupation shows\u2014267,393 persons in Government employ, or 1.62 per cent.; 5,288,006 engaged in agriculture and with animals, or 32.14 per cent.; 200,712 in trade and commerce, or 1.22 per cent.; 1,554,457 in manufactures and arts, or 9.45 per cent.; 182,950 in domestic occupations, or 1.11 per cent.; and 8,846,834, or 53.75 per cent., as belonging to the indefinite and non-productive classes, including women and children who do not work. The returns give a total of 995,464 persons as able to read and write, or under instruction; being 1 in every 16 of the population.\n\nEthnology and Language.\u2014The classification according to caste and nationality adopted in the Census Report of 1872 did not throw much light upon the ethnical characteristics of the population of Bombay; but it was supplemented by two valuable papers drawn up by the late Rev. Dr. John Wilson. The Census of 1881 returns for the British Districts 16,418,704 Asiatics; 16,852 non-Asiatics; and 18,858 whose birthplace was not returned or not ascertainable. The Asiatics are sub-divided into those from beyond the frontier of India, who number 73,252, almost entirely Baluchis, Mekranis, Persians, Pathans, and Arabs, found mostly in the Province of Sind; and natives of British India, who are further sub-divided into 562,678 aborigines, 12,308,582 Hindus, 3,021,131 Musalmans, and 453,061 \u2018others.\u2019 The total number of Hindus, again, is made up of 664,411 Brahmins, 196,906 Rajputs, 9,100,933 castes of good social position, and 2,346,332 other inferior castes of Hindus.\n\nA more intelligible principle of ethnical classification arranges the people according to their languages. This would give three territorial divisions of the Presidency, having the Marathi, the Gujarathi, and the Sindhi as their prevailing speech; and two minor territorial sub-divisions\nrepresented by the K\u00e1narese and the Konkani dialects. The principal languages are Mar\u00e1th\u00ed, spoken by 47.11 per cent. of the people; Gujar\u00e1th\u00ed, by 18.86 per cent.; K\u00e1narese, by 12.77 per cent.; Sindh\u00ed, by 12.47 per cent.; and Hindust\u00e1n\u00ed or Urdu, by 5.3 per cent.\n\nIn the north of Kh\u00e1ndesh, Mar\u00e1th\u00ed merges into Hindi; and in the D\u00e1ngs, on the west of Kh\u00e1ndesh, the Gujar\u00e1th\u00ed element is more pronounced. Along the coast, Mar\u00e1th\u00ed may be said to begin at the D\u00e1mang\u00e1ng\u00e1 river, or with Th\u00e1na District, and to run, with local variations, down to Goa; but to the east the extension is wider, and for a considerable distance into the Central Provinces, Ber\u00e1r and the territory of the Niz\u00e1m, Mar\u00e1th\u00ed is the most prevalent vernacular. In the south, away from the coast and above the Gh\u00e1ts, it may be said to follow the course of the Krishna, beyond which river K\u00e1narese pervades the whole of the southern part of the Presidency.\n\nThe Gujar\u00e1th\u00ed language begins at the north of the D\u00e1m\u00e1n river, and is the prevalent speech over the whole territory between that river and the confines of R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. Owing to the enterprise of merchants from Gujar\u00e1t, and to the use of the same language by P\u00e1rs\u00eds, as well as by Hindu traders, it has become the commercial tongue of the seaports, and is found all over the Presidency. In Cutch the language, though more Gujar\u00e1th\u00ed than anything else, has a strong Sindh\u00ed element in it. The Sindh\u00ed is confined mostly to the Province from which it derives its name.\n\nOf the languages of the Bombay Presidency, all except the K\u00e1narese are derivatives from the Sanskrit, closely allied to each other, though distinguishable by broad lines of difference. The K\u00e1narese is a member of the Dravidian family, which is dominant throughout Southern India. It is perhaps necessary to point out that the common derivation of these languages from the Sanskrit by no means involves as a corollary that the peoples who use them are equally descended from the Aryan stock. No decisive inference can be drawn from language to race. For example, the hill tribes of Bhils, who are manifestly the aborigines of this part of India, have lost the recollection of their own language, and now use whatever dialect is spoken by their more immediate neighbours. The classification, however, into Mar\u00e1th\u00ed, Gujar\u00e1th\u00ed, Sindh\u00ed, and K\u00e1narese, accurately enough represents the principal nationalities of Western India, as determined by ethnical characteristics and a common history.\n\nThe Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s have a distinct national individuality. They are an active, energetic race, liable to religious enthusiasm, and full of military ardour. In their native mountains of the Deccan, they never submitted to a permanent Muhammadan yoke; and under the successors of Siv\u00e1ji, they not only asserted their independence, but laid the greater part of India under tribute. In the season of their prosperity their vices were\nrather those of treachery and violence than of debauchery. In physical appearance they are of middle height, and somewhat of a copper colour, varying in shade in different Districts. The chief caste or tribe among them is the agricultural Kunb\u00ed, a name identical with the K\u00farm\u00eds of Northern India. Sivaji himself belonged to the fighting class of the Kunbi peasantry; and though the Kunbis are regarded by the Br\u00e1hmans as mere S\u00fadras, they themselves claim to rank with Kshattriyas or R\u00e1jputs. Altogether the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s acknowledge upwards of 200 castes, including 34 septs of Br\u00e1hmans. A comparatively high status is awarded to those castes who work in metal.\n\nThe inhabitants of Gujar\u00e1t include a somewhat larger Muhammadan element, although the Hind\u00fas among them are characterized by a strong religious feeling, which has taken shape in the popular development of the Vallabh\u00e1chariya sect of Vaishnavas. The three superior castes of Br\u00e1hmans, R\u00e1jputs, and Vaisyas are numerously represented. The Gujar\u00e1th\u00ed Br\u00e1hmans are sub-divided into no fewer than 160 different septs. The R\u00e1jput clans are specially numerous in K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, where they have given names to the local divisions of the country, and continue to be the ruling caste. The Vaisyas, whether Hind\u00fas or Jains, have attained under the common denomination of Baniy\u00e1s a high degree of prosperity as shopkeepers, money-lenders, and wholesale merchants. Their trading operations extend to the coasts of Arabia and Africa. The chief tribes forming the mass of the Gujar\u00e1t population are the Kulamb\u00eds and Ah\u00edrs; while the aboriginal race of Kul\u00eds is rapidly rising in the scale of civilisation.\n\nThe people of the outlying Province of Sind are almost all Muhammadans by religion, as their country was the earliest field of Musalm\u00e1n conquest in India. But their preservation of a dialect derived from the Sanskrit, although with a large infusion of Arabic and Persian words, indicates that they are descended from the early Hindu inhabitants of the Province, who are said to have been converted in a body during the reign of the Beni-Umayyih Khal\u00edf\u00eds. The Sind Muhammadans of foreign origin include Sayyids, Afgh\u00e1ns, Bal\u00fach\u00eds, Memons, and Khojahs. The Br\u00e1hmans of Sind are connected with their caste-fellows of the Punjab. Among the trading castes the Loh\u00e1n\u00eds deserve mention, as conducting the greater part of the trade that passes through Khel\u00e1t and Afgh\u00e1n\u00edst\u00e1n.\n\nIn K\u00e1nara and the adjoining tracts the population shares in the general characteristics of the K\u00e1rnatic. The Br\u00e1hmans form a more homogeneous body than in the rest of the Presidency, but their general influence is perhaps less, owing to the degree to which sect is substituted for caste among all Dravidians. The Ling\u00e1yats, or worshippers of Siva under the form of the linga, are an especially influential body, though of comparatively late origin.\nReligions.\u2014The religious classification in the Census Report of the 16\u00bd millions within the British Districts shows the following results:\u2014Hindus (as loosely grouped together for religious purposes), 12,308,582, or 74\u00b79 per cent. of the total population; Muhammadans, 3,021,131, or 18\u00b736 per cent.; Jains, 216,224, or 1\u00b731 per cent.; Christians, 138,317, or 0\u00b784 per cent.; P\u00e1rs\u00eds, 72,065; Sikhs, 127,100; Jews, 7952; aborigines, 562,678. The proportion of Hindus is highest in the Deccan. Of the total number of Muhammadans, as many as 1,887,204 are found in Sind, where they form 78\u00b710 of the population; only 78,531 are returned as Shi\u00e1s, and 178 as Wah\u00e1b\u00eds, the rest belonging to the Sunn\u00ed sect. The Muhammadans are again divided into the following sects and nationalities:\u2014Sayy\u00edds, 108,950; Shaikhs, 658,739; Path\u00e1ns, 105,034; Bal\u00fach\u00eds, 409,200; Sindh\u00eds, 1,275,038; other Muhammadans, 464,170. The sect of Shi\u00e1s is represented chiefly by two or three classes of traders and merchants. The largest of these is the Borah, and perhaps the best known is the Khojah; in addition to these are a few Mughals. The Shi\u00e1 element is strongest at the capital, where the trading class is most numerous. The centre of the Borah class is in Surat, the residence of their chief priest. The leader of the main body of the Khoja community is the Persian prince Ag\u00e1 Ali Shah, whose predecessor, the well-known Ag\u00e1 Kh\u00e1n, was long a resident of Bombay, after the troubles that drove him from Persia. The Khojahs are converts from Hinduism, and acknowledge as their spiritual head the Im\u00e1m of the Ism\u00e1\u00edl\u00ed sect, who are supposed to represent the Assassins (Hashisheir) of the Crusaders. They are especially numerous in the Peninsula of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r. They have also established trading colonies along the east coast of Africa. Among the Christians are included 28,859 Protestants, 35 Armenians, 21 Greeks, and 109,470 Roman Catholics. Of the whole number of Christians, 23,596 are European, 2893 Eurasian, and 111,840 Native. The great majority of the Christians are found in Bombay city and Th\u00e1na District, where the Indo-Portuguese element is strongly represented. The P\u00e1rs\u00eds number 72,065, of whom two-thirds are found in Bombay city, and a large portion of the remainder in Surat District. The Sikhs number 127,100, chiefly in Sind; and the Jews, 7952.\n\nHouses, etc.\u2014The total number of houses returned by the Census of 1881 was 3,605,812, of which 2,822,741 were occupied. The total number of towns and villages was 24,598, with an average of 669 persons to each. There were altogether 167 towns, each with more than 5000 inhabitants. The total population of these 167 towns in 1881 was 2,925,190, or 17\u00b765 per cent. of the population of the Presidency. In 1880\u201381, there were altogether 164 municipalities, including Bombay, of which 11 were city and 150 town municipalities, while the remaining 3\nwere temporary municipalities, established for the purpose of providing\nthe necessary sanitary arrangements at large fairs or gatherings of pil-\ngrims at particular seasons. The aggregate population within municipal\nlimits was 2,488,587, or 15.12 per cent. of the total. In that year the\ntotal gross municipal income, including Bombay city, was \u00a3597,820,\nthe average incidence of municipal taxation being 4s. 4\u00bdd. per head.\nThe following six towns each have a population exceeding 50,000:\u2014\nBOMBAY CITY and ISLAND, 773,196; POONA, 99,622 city, 30,129\ncantonment; AHMADABAD, 127,621; SURAT, 109,844; KARACHI\n(KURRACHEE), 73,560; SHOLAPUR, 61,281.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014The wide extent and the varied configuration of the\nBombay Presidency permit great variations in agriculture. The two\nmost important food-crops are bajra or great millet (Sorghum vulgare)\nand jowari or spiked millet (Holcus spicatus), which are especially\ncultivated in the Deccan. Rice is chiefly grown in the low lands of\nthe Konkan. Wheat is extensively cultivated in parts of Gujar\u00e1t and\nin Sind, and barley is grown in the same localities to a smaller extent.\nThe aboriginal tribes mainly support themselves on inferior cereals,\nsuch as n\u00e1chan\u00ed (Eleusine corocana) and kodra (Paspalum scrobicula-\ntum), which they plant in patches of cultivation amid the primeval\njungle that clothes the hill-sides. The most important kinds of pulse\nare gram or chick-pea (Cicer arietinum), t\u00fcr (Cajanus indicus), kulthi\n(Dolichos biflorus), and mug (Phaseolus mungo). The oil-seeds are\nmustard, linseed (of which the fibres are not utilized as flax), castor-oil,\ntil (Sesamum orientale), which yields the gingelly oil of commerce, and\nkasumba or safflower (Carthamus tinctorius). Among fibres, cotton\nholds by far the chief place, both in the Deccan and in Gujar\u00e1t; amb\u00e1ri\nor Deccan hemp (Hibiscus cannabinus) and san or Konkani hemp\n(Crotolaria juncea) are also grown. The miscellaneous crops include\ntobacco, of which the finest quality is produced in K\u00e1ira District;\nsugar-cane, which requires a rich soil and a perennial water supply;\npotatoes, grown in the hill country near Poona; red pepper, turmeric,\nother spices, and indigo. It will be observed that this list leaves few\nstaples available for export, besides cotton, oil-seeds, and wheat.\n\nThe revenue system of Bombay, based upon a cadastral survey of\nevery cultivated field, favours the collection of agricultural statistics.\nCommencing from the village as the revenue unit, and rising through\nthe taluks or Sub-divisions up to the District organization, the minutest\nparticulars affecting the administration of the land are recorded year by\nyear. The following are the statistics of cultivation for the year\n1880\u201381, excluding certain Districts to which the system of the\nrevenue survey has not yet been extended:\u2014Exclusive of Sind, the\ntotal area of cultivable lands liable to Government assessment was\nreturned at 24,839,908 acres; total area actually under cultivation.\n21,869,643, of which 20,418,867 acres are classified as dry-crop lands, and 1,041,648 as rice lands. In Sind, the cultivated land during the kharif season was returned at 1,956,787 acres, the unoccupied at 794,688 acres, the fallow at 650,601 acres; during the rabi season the figures were 293,399 acres under cultivation, 136,883 acres unoccupied, and 100,537 acres lying fallow. The chief crops in 1880\u201381 were thus distributed over an aggregate area of 20,426,966 acres: barley, 28,875; maize, 81,761; joari, 6,047,829; bajra, 3,805,474; other cereals, 2,259,158; rice, 1,757,161; wheat, 1,579,961; pulses, 1,631,944; oil-seeds, 1,086,410; cotton, 1,826,407; tobacco, 55,156; sugar-cane, 51,329; garden produce, 86,427; condiments, spices, and drugs, 116,099; dyes, 12,975; the sums advanced by Government during the season to agriculturists for purchase of seed and stock amounted to \u00a33,946, including a sum of \u00a3421 for permanent improvements. At the close of the year 1881, there were 78 Government stallions for the improvement of horse-breeding and stock, at various places in the Presidency. The number of mares covered in that year was 2185. The stallions were in greatest request at Sirur, Poona (Puna), Ahmadnagar, and Jacobabad, and in Khandesh District and Kothiawar.\n\nCotton.\u2014The cultivation of the great export staple of cotton is sufficiently important to deserve special mention. Even before the close of the last century, India exported a considerable amount of raw cotton to England, but this was mainly grown in Bundelkhand, collected at Ghazipur, and shipped from Calcutta. The trade was fostered by the East India Company; but it does not appear to have been of a profitable nature, and the totals despatched fluctuated greatly year by year. Bombay appears not to have entered into the business until about 1825. For many years afterwards the shipments of cotton were liable to great vicissitudes, depending chiefly upon the yield of the American crop. But the Indian cultivators found their opportunity when the war between the North and South in the United States cut off the supplies of the English manufacturer, and caused the 'cotton famine' among the mill operatives in Lancashire. During the five years ending with 1853\u201354, the export of cotton from Bombay had averaged under 180 million lbs., valued at 2\u00bd millions sterling; in the five years ending 1868\u201369, the average quantity had risen to 424 million lbs., and the average value to nearly 20 millions sterling. In the single year 1864\u201365, the value was as high as \u00a330,370,482. This period of extraordinary prosperity led to much wild speculation. The collapse came in 1865, on the termination of the American war. The bubble schemes and financial companies in Bombay city burst one after the other, and brought down in the general ruin the quasi-official Bank of Bombay. Meanwhile, the cultivators had turned the excessive profits of a few years, into the solid form of gold\nand silver ornaments. Prices have fallen very heavily, but the quantity of cotton grown is maintained. In 1875-76, the amount exported was 3,722,436 cwts., valued at \u00a310,209,389, or nearly as large a quantity as when speculation was at its height, though the value is diminished to one-third. In 1880-81, the extent of land under cotton in the whole Presidency, including Sind and the Native States, was returned at 4,193,074 acres. Of this area, 3,450,503 acres were planted with indigenous, and 742,571 with exotic cotton. The quantity exported in the same year from the Presidency was returned at 3,220,308 cwts., valued at \u00a39,779,049 from Bombay, and 104,605 cwts., valued at \u00a3285,776, from Sind. In the same year the total number of steam gins was 2430. Much has been done of late years to improve the quality of the cotton grown in the Presidency. American varieties have been introduced successfully into Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r and other parts of the South Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 country. In Kh\u00e1ndesh the indigenous plant, from which one of the lowest classes in the Bombay market took its name, has now been almost superseded by the Hingangh\u00e1t variety from the Central Provinces, under the trade name Amr\u00e1oti ('Oomrawutty'). Agricultural experiments in cotton as well as in other crops are made at three State Model Farms, at H\u00e1la in Sind, in Kh\u00e1ndesh, and in Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r. Though these experiments have not resulted in pecuniary profit, much valuable information has been gained.\n\nIrrigation.\u2014Except in Sind, where the annual rainfall is insignificant, and the crops are entirely dependent upon artificial supplies of water drawn from the Indus by a network of canals, irrigation is not generally practised in the Bombay Presidency. In bad seasons every advantage is taken of the water that is available for use in river-beds, tanks, or wells, but there are no irrigation works constructed on a scale sufficiently large to give permanent benefit to wide areas of country. Within the last few years some steps have been taken in this direction, but the broken character of the greater part of the country does not readily lend itself to such schemes. In the year 1880-81, out of a total area of 24,839,908 acres of cultivable land, excluding Sind, the area under irrigation was thus classified: irrigated garden lands, 409,127 acres; rice lands irrigated from tanks and watercourses, 147,551 acres; total irrigated, 556,678 acres. The irrigation system of Sind will be described in the separate article on that Province. The most important works which have been already carried out, and which are in progress, in Bombay Proper are the following:\u2014The Kistna (Krishna) Canal in Sat\u00e1ra District, formed by throwing a masonry dam across the bed of the river; the H\u00e1thmati Canal in Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d District; the improvement of the Kh\u00e1ri river irrigation; the works for the water supply of the Government saltworks at Kh\u00e1r\u00e1gora near the Rann of Cutch; works for the purpose of increasing the efficiency of the Palkher Canal\nin N\u00e1sik District; the works at the Wagh\u0101r tank in the same District; the works at the Bhadalv\u0101ri tank in Poona District; the works at the Ashti tank in Shol\u00e1pur District; the Shol\u00e1pur municipal waterworks; the works at the Nira and Mhasmad tanks in Sat\u0101ra District; a canal in Belg\u00e1um District; the Ekruk Tank in Shol\u00e1pur, formed by an earthen dam across the entire valley of the Adela; and the waterworks at Kharakw\u0101sla, destined to irrigate the surrounding fields as well as to supply water to the city of Poona. The severe famine of 1877 has drawn increased attention to this important subject, and plans have been prepared for the construction of irrigation works in all parts of the Presidency, to be commenced as funds permit. In 1880\u201381, the total expenditure on irrigation works through the Public Works Department was \u00a3232,830. Of this sum, \u00a3211,869 was contributed from Imperial revenue, \u00a319,613 from Native States, private individuals, and municipalities, and \u00a31349 from local funds. The direct revenue from irrigation during the same period was \u00a326,726. The 24 irrigation works constructed by the Public Works Department in Gujar\u00e1t and the Deccan command an area of 224,000 acres of irrigable land, though the area actually irrigated in 1880\u201381 was only 34,444 acres.\n\nThe land revenue system of Bombay is based upon the principle of measuring every field separately, and assessing it at a sum fixed for a term of thirty years, the amount of assessment being determined by the quality of the soil and the crop. This plan was first introduced in 1836, in the case of the Ind\u00e1pur t\u00e1luk of Poona District, and has since been gradually extended over the greater part of the Presidency. It differs from the method adopted in the North-Western Provinces, in that the assessment is made direct with the individual cultivators, and not with the village community; and it differs from the rayatw\u0101ri system of Madras, by not requiring a modification of the assessment every year. Prior to the introduction of the revenue survey, general anarchy prevailed, both with regard to the rights possessed by different parties in the soil, and also with regard to the proportion of the produce payable to Government. The immediate result of the change was to improve the condition of the cultivator. He has received a right of occupancy in his holding, on the condition of payment of the Government revenue. This right of occupancy, commonly known as \u2018the survey tenure,\u2019 has been described as \u2018a transferable and heritable property continuable without question at the expiration of a settlement lease, on the occupier\u2019s consenting to the revised rate.\u2019 The average rates of assessment are\u2014Rs. 0. 12. 7 or 1s. 7d. per acre on dry crops; Rs. 3. 11. 4 or 7s. 5d. on garden lands; and Rs. 3. 9. 5 or 7s. 2d. on rice land. The maximum on dry-crop lands is Rs. 2. 3. 4 or 4s. 5d. per acre in the rich black country of Gujar\u00e1t, and the minimum is Rs. 0. 6. 6\nor 9\u00bdd. in the barren hill-tracts of the Konkan. Within the last few years the terms of assessment in the Districts earliest settled have begun to fall in, and consequently a revision of the assessment has become necessary; and this is now being carried on in the Districts of N\u00e1sik, Ahmadnagar, Poona, Shol\u00e1pur, Belg\u00e1um, Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r, and Kal\u00e1dgi.\n\nIn the course of the inquiries it has been discovered that the cultivator has not reaped all the advantages that had been hoped from the simplicity of the system. His chronic condition of indebtedness to the village money-lender has produced consequences not dissimilar to those caused by the zamind\u00e1ri system in Bengal. No intermediate rights in the soil have been suffered to grow up between the cultivator and the State; but the personal obligations under which the cultivator has placed himself towards his money-lender enable the latter to appropriate to himself the unearned increment as completely as if he were a landlord. The system, although framed with the best intentions, put the machinery of our Courts at the disposal of the astute creditors as against an ignorant peasantry. During some years, the cultivators were sold off the land without mercy; agrarian outrages took place; and the Legislature was at length compelled to interfere in favour of the tillers of the soil. The Deccan Agriculturists' Relief Acts have placed them under a modified procedure for the recovery of debts; protected their holdings from sale; and endeavoured to work out a plan which would satisfy as far as possible the dues of the creditor from the yearly produce of the debtor's fields without altogether driving the debtor off the land. The rigidity of our revenue system, and its want of elasticity in the Deccan Districts, which are peculiarly exposed to the vicissitudes of the rainfall, are also said to bear heavily on the peasantry. The increase of revenue resulting from the resettlement operations in the Districts named above, up to 1881\u201382, is returned at \u00a31,023,503.\n\nSide by side with the survey tenure, there exist various forms of landholding which have come down from the days of native rule, though none of them are now prevalent to a wide extent. Among these the t\u00e1lukd\u00e1ri, w\u00e1nta, narw\u00e1dd\u00e1ri and m\u00e1leki tenures in Gujar\u00e1t deserve mention. In the Districts of the Southern Konkan, the survey has not yet been introduced. The land is there held by a class of petty landlords called kh\u00f3ts, whose rights as against the Government have not yet been finally determined. The non-regulation Province of Sind enjoys a modified land system of its own. The greater part of the land is cultivated by peasant proprietors. The rates of assessment depend to a large extent on a steady but not excessive overflow from the Indus, and payment in cash has been substituted for the old practice of an actual division of the crop.\n\nThe Famine of 1876\u201377 was felt throughout the Deccan and South Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 country, though less severely than in the adjoining Districts\nof Madras (q.v.) and Mysore. The same set of meteorological causes operated over all Southern India. The total rainfall of the year was everywhere deficient, but the disastrous effect upon agriculture was determined mainly by local variations. The harvest of 1875 had also been below the average, so that the pressure of high prices fell upon a population already impoverished. In 1876 the summer rains of the south-west monsoon, which commence in June, were scanty. But the effects of this monsoon on cultivation are chiefly confined to the Konkan and Malabar coast, where the normal rainfall is so excessive that little injury was wrought by the deficiency. The autumn rains of the north-east monsoon, upon which the table-land behind the Ghats is mainly dependent, failed altogether. At Poona the heavy rain, which usually falls continuously during September and October, was represented by only two moderately wet days. The result was a general failure in the winter crops, over an area in this Presidency estimated at 39,000 square miles, with a population of nearly six million souls. Serious distress began in November 1876, and lasted for about twelve months. In April 1877, the number of people employed by Government on relief works was 287,000. In July of the same year, the persons in the receipt of gratuitous relief numbered 160,000. The District most affected was Kaladgi, bordering on the Nizam's dominions, where the relieved numbered 14 per cent. of the total population. But these vague figures convey but an inadequate idea of the general impoverishment produced by this disastrous year. The statistics of the Bombay mint show in a decisive manner how even the well-to-do portion of the population suffered. In the two years 1877 and 1878, the total value of silver ornaments and disused coin brought into the mint as bullion exceeded 2\u00bd millions sterling, against only \u00a34000 in the previous year. No interference with private trade was attempted. The Government endeavoured to provide work for the starving population. But notwithstanding the wages offered, and the supplies of food brought into the Districts, the calamity proved beyond the power of administrative control, and hundreds of thousands died of starvation. The deaths in the two famine years 1877 and 1878 in the Bombay Presidency, excluding Sind, are estimated to have been 800,000 in excess of the usual number. The opportunity was taken to push on schemes of irrigation and other remunerative public works, which had long previously been matured on paper.\n\nManufactures.\u2014The two great manufactures carried on in this Presidency are cotton goods and salt; the latter is to a large extent manufactured departmentally. Indigo is made to some extent at Khairpur in Sind. Apart from the new industry of cotton spinning and weaving by means of steam machinery, the manufacture of coarse cotton cloth saris and pagris in hand-looms is still conducted in almost every village through-\nout Bombay. A curious distinction in this respect separates the Gujar\u00e1th\u00ed and Mar\u00e1th\u00ed speaking races. The former prefer their cotton goods printed, while the latter wear only stuffs that have been dyed in the thread. The decoration generally consists of a simple border, but the more expensive articles are frequently finished off with silk, or with gold and silver lace. Sind weavers are reckoned the most skilful. The best s\u00e1ris or women's robes are printed at Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d and Surat. Even to the present day the majority of the population wear home-spun and home-woven goods; but within the past few years, the twists and yarns produced in the Bombay mills have found great favour with native weavers. A peculiar mode of ornamenting cotton and silk goods, known as chind\u00e1ri, is common throughout the Presidency. The cloth, after being once dyed, is marked with the desired pattern, the outline of which is picked and twisted so as to form a raised surface; the cloth is then again put into the vat to be dyed a fresh colour, and when taken out the raised threads are removed, leaving the pattern of the original colour underneath. Carpets, rugs, horse-cloth, towels, napkins, etc., are manufactured in the jails throughout the Presidency, especially in Sind. Ahmadnagar is celebrated for its carpets, and Kh\u00e1ndesh and Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r for drugget rugs and bullock-cloths. The raw material employed in manufactures of silk is imported from China. The chief seats of silk-weaving are Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d, Surat, Poona, N\u00e1sik, and Yeola. The two first of these places produce kinkh\u00e1bs, or brocades of silk and gold and silver thread, which are famous throughout India; the three last have a reputation for silk or cotton s\u00e1ris, finished off with rich borders of gold, silver, or silk lace, and beautifully filled in with designs executed on the looms. The silk dhotars and pit\u00e1mbars of Yeola are in great request. The preparation of gold and silver thread is performed with great skill. It is said that one rupee's worth of silver can be drawn out into a thread 800 yards in length. The metallic thread is either twisted with silk before being used in the looms, or sometimes beaten out flat to form a warp by itself. The embroidery of various articles with gold and silver thread for the use of the Muhammedan and P\u00e1rsi communities, or for the European market, is carried on at Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d in Sind, in K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, and at Baroda, Surat, and Bombay. The manufacture of coarse paper from raw vegetable fibres is conducted in several of the large towns, especially at Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d and Baroda; also at smaller local centres, such as Junar in Poona District. The manufacture of coir rope is an industry which thrives in the Konkan and K\u00e1nara, and coarse kamblis or blankets are made in Kh\u00e1ndesh, N\u00e1sik, Shol\u00e1pur, and Ratnagiri. Toys in ivory and clay are made in Surat and Poona, and the carpets of Sind enjoy a wide reputation. Among articles of leather work may be mentioned the debaro, or large vessel used for holding oil, etc., which is formed by stretching a\nfresh skin round an inner mould of clay. Saddle covers and cloths, shoes, leggings, blankets, felts, and accoutrements are made in Sind, and the ancient manufacture of shields at Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d has not yet entirely died out. The common pottery of the Presidency is of a very rude description, but Sind produces some of the best potters' ware of all India. The art is thought to have been introduced by the Am\u00edrs, or former Muhammadan rulers, whose mosques and tombs attest the degree of excellence attained. The Bombay School of Art is now successfully promoting the revival of this industry. Special qualities of pottery are made at Patan in the State of Baroda, and at Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d. N\u00e1sik and Poona are celebrated for their brass-ware. Bombay city and Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d also turn out large quantities of brass utensils, which are hammered by native workmen out of sheets imported from Europe. In the department of cutlery, spear-heads are made at Ahmadnagar, and hunting-knives, swords, and chain armour in Cutch, K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, and Baroda. Ironwork, besides cutlery, is still hammered with great skill at Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d, where the beautiful gates of the tomb of Sh\u00e1h Alam afford an example of an extinct industry in perforated brasswork. Fine art is represented by a large number of ornamented articles manufactured in all parts of the Presidency. The personal decorations of the women of Guj\u00e1r\u00e1t are distinguished by solidity, and those of Mar\u00e1th\u00ed women by intricacy of design. The Muhammadans and P\u00e1rs\u00eds also have each styles of ornament peculiar to themselves. The goldsmiths' work of Sind is very beautiful. The embossed gold and silver work of the Cutch workmen is much sought after, and they have established a colony at Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d and Bombay. Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d and Surat are also celebrated for wood-carving. Most of the houses are ornamented in this way, and furniture and boxes are carved in ebony and blackwood. The best sandal-wood carving comes from K\u00fampt\u00e1 (Coompta) in K\u00e1nara. Sculpture has been practised by the stonecutters of Cutch and K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r from time immemorial. The more elaborate portions of the stonework on the recently erected public buildings in Bombay were executed by these workmen, trained in the School of Art and the Public Works Department.\n\nCotton Mills.\u2014Within the last twenty years the spinning and weaving of cotton by steam machinery, and under European supervision, has become an important industry. The local cotton mills have certain natural advantages. Both the raw material and the market for the manufactured produce lie at their feet. The first mill was started in Bombay in 1857; and according to the latest returns, there are now (1881) 36 mills at work in Bombay city and its suburbs, and 13 in other parts of the Presidency, not including those in contemplation or in course of erection. These 49 mills employ a total of 1,237,536 spindles and 13,046 looms; and probably consume about 157,000 khandis\n(candies) of 784 lbs. each of cotton. They are almost without exception the property of joint-stock companies. The hours of work for the operatives are from six in the morning to six at night, with an hour allowed in the middle of the day for meals and smoking. A Factory Act regulates the hours of labour for children. The average number of hands employed is 37,567; and the average wages per month are, for a girl, 10s.; a woman, 16s.; a man, \u00a31, 12s. The natives are gradually learning to qualify themselves for the posts requiring superior skill, which are at present mostly occupied by operatives brought from England. Besides supplying the local demand, these cotton mills are beginning to find a market in foreign countries, especially for their twist and yarn, which meets with much favour. During the year 1880-81, the exports of Indian twist were 26,442,671 lbs., valued at \u00a31,260,296, of which by far the larger portion was sent to China. The value of the exported piece-goods manufactured at the mills of the Presidency was returned in the same year at \u00a3405,370.\n\nRoads and Railways.\u2014The roads throughout the Presidency are chiefly constructed and maintained out of local funds by the agency of the District officers. A two-thirds share of the 1 anna cess levied on every rupee of land revenue is set apart for this purpose, and augmented by contributions from tolls, ferries, etc. In 1880-81, the receipts of the District Road Fund amounted to \u00a3229,560, and the expenditure to \u00a3224,782. Certain trunk roads, and the construction of important buildings and bridges, are under the charge of the Public Works Department, which in the same year expended \u00a3298,219, of which \u00a380,014 was appropriated to original works, and \u00a3165,287 to repairs. The total expenditure on Public Works (including establishment) in the Bombay Presidency in the year 1880-81, was \u00a3640,186 in the Roads and Buildings branch; the outlay on military works was \u00a3144,712. Works for the protection against the sea of the harbour defences at Manora Point at Kar\u00e1ch\u00ed are in progress, as well as the improvement of the fortifications of Bombay harbour. At the close of the year 1880-81, there were 3150\u00be miles of railway open under the Government of Bombay. This does not include any of the railways in Sind, which are now under the administration of the Government of India. There were 100 miles under construction at the end of 1880-81, and 227 under survey. The two chief railways under the control of the Bombay Government are the Great Indian Peninsula, with 1287 miles open in 1881; and the Bombay, Baroda and Central Indian, with 421 miles. Both these are guaranteed railways of the standard gauge of 5 feet 6 inches; and both have their terminus in Bombay Island. The former, after running a few miles east of Th\u00e1na, bifurcates into two branches at Kalyan. One of these branches runs north-east via the Thal Gh\u00e1t\n\n[Sentence continued on p. 64.]\n## Foreign Trade of the Bombay Presidency for 1880\u201381\n\n| Imports | Quantity | Value | Exports | Quantity | Value |\n|---------|----------|-------|---------|----------|-------|\n| Agricultural Implements | No. | ... | \u00a32,043 | Cotton, twist and yarn, lbs. | 571,451 | \u00a342,626 |\n| Animals, living | ... | 1,938 | 49,243 | \" piece-goods, grey yds. | 13,627,910 | 102,277 |\n| Apparel | ... | 237,495 | ... | \" white, | 5,324,388 | 82,053 |\n| Arms and ammunition | ... | 31,127 | | \" coloured, | 39,661,912 | 842,144 |\n| Books, etc. | cwt. | 4,595 | 54,893 | \" sundry manufactured, lbs. | ... | 9,443 |\n| Building and engineering materials | ... | 42,693 | 21,169 | Guns and resins, cwt. | 26,994 | 50,243 |\n| Candles | lbs. | 592,593 | 47,760 | Ivory, | ... | 87,396 |\n| Clocks and watches | No. | 40,231 | ... | Iron, | 62,424 | 68,959 |\n| Coal and coke | tons | 512,533 | 994,160 | Sugar, | 109,535 | 193,938 |\n| Coral | lbs. | 9,328 | 5,515 | Miscellaneous, | ... | 801,900 |\n| Cork | cwt. | 889 | 12,812 | Total, | ... | \u00a32,370,979 |\n| Cotton, raw | ... | 56,821 | 145,550 | Indian Produce and Manufactures, | ... | ... |\n| \" twist and yarn, lbs. | 12,193,538 | 933,701 | Animals, living, | ... | \u00a335 |\n| \" piece-goods (grey), yds. | 349,863,875 | 3,996,248 | Apparel, | ... | 31,376 |\n| \" \" (white), | 92,217,624 | 1,164,716 | Coffee, | cwt. | 41,801 |\n| \" (coloured), | 123,428,855 | 2,048,025 | Coir, | | 35,498 |\n| \" sundry manufactured, | ... | 258,161 | Cotton, raw, | ... | 10,064,825 |\n| Drugs and medicines, | ... | 158,857 | \" twist and yarn, lbs. | 26,442,671 | 1,260,206 |\n| Dyes and colouring materials, | cwt. | 3,230,840 | 170,896 | \" piece-goods, | ... |\n| Earthenware and pottery, | ... | 45,032 | | | ... | 405,370 |\n| Flax, manufactured, | yds. | 1,317,975 | 51,569 | Drugs and medicines, | ... | 13,861 |\n| \" other sorts, | lbs. | 40,855 | 6,348 | Indigo, | cwt. | 3,464 |\n| Fruits and vegetables, | ... | 15,121 | 15,121 | Other dyes, | ... | 210,337 |\n| Glass and glassware | ... | 205,114 | | Gram, | ... | 91,880 |\n| Gums and resins | cwt. | 63,143 | 102,098 | Rice, husked, | | 958,624 |\n| Hardware and cutlery, | ... | 256,760 | | Wheat, | | 3,484,535 |\n| Instruments and apparatus | ... | 45,160 | | Other food-grains, | | 510,747 |\n| Ivory, | ... | 210,840 | | | | 173,837 |\n| Jewellery, | ... | 159,574 | | | | |\n| Leather, | ... | 82,962 | | | | |\n| Liquors, all kinds | gals. | 821,418 | 478,502 | Gums and resins, | | 213 |\n| Machinery | ... | 258,091 | | Hemp, raw, | ... | 31,268 |\n| Matches | ... | 44,911 | | manufactured, | ... | 221 |\n| Metals, copper, | cwt. | 160,870 | 666,815 | | | |\n| \" iron, | ... | 1,130,571 | 666,328 | | | |\n\n---\n\n**BOMBAY PRESIDENCY.**\n| Imports | Quantity | Value |\n|---------|----------|-------|\n| Metals, lead, steel, tin, zinc, other sorts, Oils, Paints and colours, Paper and pasteboard, Provisions, Railway plant, Salt, Shells, Silk, raw, manufactured, Spices, Sugar, Tobacco and cigars, Tea, Tobacco and cigars, Tweed or cloths, Wool, raw, manufactured, other articles, All other articles, Treasure (Gold rush), Government stores |\n\n|exports | Quantity | Value |\n|---------|----------|-------|\n| Hides and skins, jewellery, ete., \" raw, manufactured, Lac shell, Oils, Opium, Provisions, Sulphtre, Seeds, raw, Silk, raw, manufactured, Spices, Sugar, Stone and marble, Sugar, Tobacco and cigars, Wax, Wool, raw, manufactured, Miscellaneous | cwt. tons lbs. cwt. lbs.

The other original branch of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway from Kalyan Junction turns south-east, and, after climbing into the Deccan by the Bhor Gh\u00e1t below Poona (P\u00fana), finally joins the Madras Railway. In 1880, the net earnings of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway within the Presidency amounted to \u00a31,110,555; the gross expenditure amounted to \u00a31,384,770. Up to the same year the cost of construction amounted to \u00a321,311,591; cost of rolling stock, \u00a33,686,128; stores, \u00a3591,891.\n\nThe Dhond and Manm\u00e1d State Railway, 145 miles in length, connects the northern and southern branches of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway by a chord line above the Gh\u00e1ts at Dhond and Manm\u00e1d stations from which it takes its name. This chord line was constructed as a State line, but the Great Indian Peninsula Railway now works it. It admits of traffic between Madras and Northern India, without compelling passengers and goods to descend and re-ascend the Bombay Gh\u00e1ts. The Bombay, Baroda and Central Indian Railway runs due north along the sea-coast past the cities of Surat, Broach, and Baroda, and terminates at P\u00e1lanpur, with a westerly branch from Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d to Viramg\u00e1m. This line lies wholly within the limits of the Bombay Presidency. Up to 1881, the total capital expended upon it has been \u00a38,473,162; the gross receipts were for the year \u00a3824,437; and the expenses \u00a3350,972, leaving as net earnings \u00a3473,465. The P\u00e1tri State Railway, 22 miles, leaves this line at Viramg\u00e1m terminus in a north-westerly direction; while the K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r and Bh\u00e1unagar-Gondal line, 194 miles, leaves the same terminus in a direction first south for a distance of 100 miles, and then west through the peninsula of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, to the terminus at Dhor\u00e1j\u00ed. The R\u00e1jput\u00e1na State Railway, with a total length of 717 miles from Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d to Ajmere, Delhi and Agra, northwards, has been made over to the charge of the Bombay Government. The total length of the State Railway lines under the Government of Bombay at the end of 1881, was 1188 miles. The R\u00e1jput\u00e1na-M\u00e1lw\u00e1 Railway, 389 miles, from Khandwa station on the north-eastern branch of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, to Neemuch, Nas\u00edr\u00e1b\u00e1d and Ajmere, has since been transferred to the control of the Bombay Government. Other small lines of narrow gauge, aggregating a length of about 60 miles, and belonging to the G\u00e1\u00e9kw\u00e1r of Baroda, branch off from the main line of the Bombay, Baroda and Central India Railway. There are no navigable canals in the Presidency, but the main channel of the Indus is kept open by the State at an annual cost of about \u00a36000.\n\nCommerce and Trade.\u2014The table on pages 62 and 63 gives the\nprincipal items of the import and export trade of the Bombay Presidency, including Sind, for the year 1880-81.\n\nThe total sea-borne foreign trade of Bombay Presidency, including both imports and exports, reached a total value of \u00a357,287,885. These figures are exclusive of the coasting trade, which in 1880-81 amounted to a total value of \u00a315,450,126 imports, and \u00a314,723,700 exports; total, \u00a330,173,826; grand total, \u00a387,461,711. The foreign trade, exclusive of treasure and Government stores, was thus distributed among the chief countries:\u2014United Kingdom\u2014imports \u00a318,041,382, exports \u00a37,860,205; China\u2014imports \u00a32,698,896, exports \u00a37,483,278; Mauritius\u2014imports \u00a31,239,531, exports \u00a399,168; Arabia\u2014imports \u00a3885,218, exports \u00a3715,881; Persia\u2014imports \u00a3528,425, exports \u00a31,004,681; Italy\u2014imports \u00a31,036,027, exports \u00a32,031,869; France\u2014imports \u00a3416,844, exports \u00a33,579,113; United States\u2014imports \u00a3230,639, exports \u00a38609; Ceylon\u2014imports \u00a379,133, exports \u00a388,331; Austria\u2014imports \u00a3366,820, exports \u00a31,476,689; Straits Settlements\u2014imports \u00a3182,701, exports \u00a3271,653; other countries\u2014imports \u00a31,434,518, exports \u00a33,026,677.\n\nThe number of vessels that entered the ports of Bombay Presidency with cargoes from foreign countries during the year 1880-81 was 1500, with a tonnage of 1,070,358 tons, of which 647 vessels (773,117 tons) were steam vessels. In addition, 45 vessels, with a tonnage of 38,049 tons, entered in ballast. The coasting trade was carried on by 84,812 vessels, with a tonnage of 2,026,645 tons, of which 83,049 vessels (1,296,173 tons) were native craft. Excluding the two great harbours of Bombay and Karachi, the remaining ports in the Presidency are divided into two groups\u2014the northern, comprising 22 ports between Gogo and the Bassein creek; and the southern, which includes 51 ports between Bassein and Bhatakal, in North Kanara. About four-fifths of the coasting trade is conducted by the southern group.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The Government of the Presidency of Bombay is administered by a Governor and his Council. This body is the chief executive and legislative authority of the Presidency, and consists of the Governor as President, the Commander-in-Chief of the Bombay Presidency, and two members of the Covenanted Civil Service. The various departments of the administration are portioned out among the several members of Council, and for each department there is a separate secretariat staff. There is also a Legislative Council, composed of the Governor and his Executive Council above described, together with four to eight other members nominated by the Governor. Not less than a certain proportion of these additional Legislative members of the Council must be non-officials, with a view to the representation of the European and native communities. For administrative purposes\nthe Presidency is divided into four Divisions, called the Northern (7 Districts), Central (7 Districts, including Bombay city and island), and Southern (5 Districts), in Bombay Proper, and the Sind Division of 5 Districts; these Divisions embrace (including Bombay city and island) 24 Districts, each Division being placed under the control and superintendence of a Commissioner. The District is the actual unit of administration for both fiscal and judicial purposes. The Regulation Districts of Bombay number 17, each under the control of a Magistrate-Collector, who must be a member of the Covenanted Civil Service. The Province of Sind, and the P\u00e1nch-Mah\u00e1ls in Gujar\u00e1t, form 7 non-regulation Districts, under officers who may be either military, covenanted or uncovenanted servants. The city of Bombay is regarded for many purposes as forming a District by itself. Each District is on the average divided into 10 t\u00e1lukas, or Sub-divisions, each of which again contains about 100 Government villages, or villages of which the revenue has not been alienated by the State. Every village is, for fiscal and police, as well as social purposes, complete by itself. It has its regular complement of officials, who are usually hereditary, and are remunerated by grants of land held revenue free. The more important of these officials are the p\u00e1tel or head-man; the tal\u00e1ti or kulkarni, who is the clerk and accountant; the mh\u00e1r, who is a kind of beadle; and the watchman. Over each t\u00e1luka or Sub-division is set a Government officer termed a m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r; and on an average about 3 t\u00e1lukas are placed in charge of an Assistant or Deputy Collector. General supervision is exercised by the Commissioners, as above stated, who are 3 for the Regulation Districts and 1 for Sind. The supreme administration of justice in the Regulation Districts is entrusted to the High Court, consisting of a Chief Justice and seven Puisne Judges. This Court exercises both original and appellate jurisdiction in civil and criminal cases. In Sind, the same functions are discharged by the Judicial Commissioner. The superior administration of both civil and criminal justice is vested in officials styled District and Assistant District Judges. Original civil suits (if not against the Government) are decided as a rule by two classes of Subordinate Judges, and by the Small Cause Courts; and the greater part of the original criminal work is disposed of by the executive District officers, who in addition to their revenue duties are entrusted with magisterial powers. The remaining principal departments of Government are the police, public works, forests, education, jails, registration and medical departments, each of which possesses an organization extending throughout all the different Districts of the Presidency.\n\nThe Political relations between the Government and the Native States in connection with the Bombay Presidency are maintained by the presence of an Agent or representative at the principal Native Courts.\nThe position and duty of the Agent varies very considerably in the different States, being governed by the terms of the original treaties, or by recent sanads or patents. In some instances, as in Cutch, his power is confined to the giving of advice, and to the exercise of a general surveillance. In other cases the Agent is invested with an actual share in the administration; while States whose rulers are minors\u2014and the number of these is always large\u2014are directly managed by Government officers. The characteristic feature of the Bombay Native States is the excessive number of petty principalities, such as those of the R\u00e1jput and Bh\u00edl chieftains. The peninsula of K\u00e1thiaw\u00e1r alone contains no less than 187 separate States. The recognition of these innumerable jurisdictions is due to the circumstance that the early Bombay administrators were induced to treat the de facto exercise of civil and criminal jurisdiction by a landholder as carrying with it a quasi-sovereign status. The rule of succession by primogeniture applies only to the larger principalities, and consequently the minor States are continually suffering disintegration.\n\nThe Bombay army in 1881 consisted of a strength of 13,082 Europeans and 26,730 natives; total, 39,812 fighting men. This force was made up of 1 regiment of European and 9 regiments of native cavalry; 47 European and 541 native sappers; 23 batteries of European artillery with 96 guns, and 2 of native artillery with 12 guns (the heavy ordnance in Bombay island, Kar\u00e1ch\u00ed and Aden not included); 11 regiments of European and 30 of native infantry. The military Divisions and Districts of the Presidency are as follow: Poona (P\u00fana) Division, with 9 stations, head-quarters Poona; Northern Division, with 11 stations, head-quarters Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d; Aden Brigade, head-quarters Aden; Belg\u00e1um District, with 4 stations, head-quarters Belg\u00e1um; Bombay District, with 5 stations, head-quarters Bombay city; and Sind District, head-quarters Kar\u00e1ch\u00ed; and there are besides several cantonment stations, including Mau (Mhow), N\u00edmach (Neemuch), Nas\u00edr\u00e1b\u00e1d (Nusseer\u00e1b\u00e1d), and D\u00eds\u00e1 (Deesa), in Central India, which all lie beyond the geographical limits of the Presidency. The military convalescent stations are Purandhar on the hills, and Kol\u00e1ba and Ghizri Bandar on the sea-coast. In the year 1880\u201381, the total military expenditure amounted to \u00a35,428,599, of which \u00a35,40,683 belonged to the European, and \u00a3719,844 to the native army; \u00a31,760,629 was devoted to effective services, \u00a3136,122 to non-effective services, including pensions, and the remainder, \u00a32,271,321, to the war in Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n.\n\nThe Bombay Marine in 1881 consisted of ten steam vessels, two hulks in ordinary, and two ironclad turret monitors (the Abyssinia and the Magdala) for the defence of Bombay harbour. The total establishment consisted of about 700 officers and men. Of the ten steam vessels mentioned above, two were stationed at Aden, and two in the\nPersian Gulf. The total receipts for 1880-81 of the shipping office amounted to \u00a33258, against an expenditure of \u00a31408. The total expenditure during the year 1880-81 of the Bombay Port Trust was \u00a3270,394, including a sum of \u00a3121,534 for interest to be paid in 1881-82, against which must be set off receipts amounting to \u00a3276,682.\n\nThe Police consists of several distinct forces,\u2014the Regular District Police, the Bombay City Police, the Railway Police, and the Village Watch. The last-mentioned body is maintained only in certain parts of the country, at the expense of the villagers, and is not directly under the control of Government. The Bombay City Police will be treated of in the separate article on Bombay City. The following figures, therefore, only apply to the Regular and the Railway Police. In the year 1880-81, these two forces consisted of a strength of 3280 officers and 16,353 men\u2014total, 19,633; being 1 man to every 6\u00b74 square miles as compared with the area of the Presidency, or 1 to every 810 of the population. The proportion of police to area is largest in the P\u00e1nch Mah\u00e1ls District of Gujar\u00e1t (Guzer\u00e1t), where it is 1 to 2\u00b707 square miles, and least in the Thar and P\u00e1rkar District of Sind, where it is 1 to 26\u00b70 square miles. The total cost was \u00a3324,967, of which \u00a3297,785 was met from Provincial revenues, and \u00a327,182 was payable from other sources than Provincial revenue, showing an average cost of \u00a32, 1 2s. 4d. per square mile of area, and 4\u00bdd. per head of population. Of the total force, 45 per cent. were armed with firearms, and 34 per cent. with swords, the rest having only batons. In 1880-81, the total number of cases of cognizable crime reported was 62,487; 53,428 persons were arrested and 48,923 put on their trial, of whom 42 per cent. were convicted. The total number of non-cognizable cases was 2089; 3368 persons were arrested or summoned, of whom 1547 were convicted. By far the greater number of the convictions were for petty offences.\n\nJails.\u2014In 1881, there were altogether 27 jails in Bombay Presidency, including the common jail and the house of correction in Bombay city, the central jail at Yerauda near Poona (P\u00fana), and the jail at Aden; and 78 subordinate lock-ups. In that year the daily average prison population was 11,236, of whom 536 were women. These figures show 1 prisoner always in jail to every 1464 of the population, and 1 woman in jail to every 14,845 of the female population. The number of deaths was 493; or 4\u00b74 per cent. of the average strength. The gross total expenditure, exclusive of the sum expended on subordinate jails, was \u00a389,702, or \u00a36, 19s. 3\u00bdd. per head. The expenditure on subordinate jails was \u00a32596. Jail manufactures, including garden work and extramural labour, yielded a net profit of \u00a320,337.\n## Revenue and Expenditure of the Bombay Presidency for 1880-81\n\n### Receipts\n\n| Imperial | Provincial Funds | Local Funds |\n|----------|------------------|-------------|\n| Land Revenue | 3,092,029 | 653,017 |\n| Tribute and Contributions | 131,925 | 540,839 |\n| Forests | 152,220 | 420,533 |\n| Assessed Taxes | 98,066 | 8,341 |\n| Customs | 782,129 | 4,388 |\n| Salt | 1,495,816 | 421,536 |\n| Opium | 2,546,374 | 27,931 |\n| Mint | 64,326 | 2,132 |\n| Police | 29 | 90,553 |\n| Stationery and Printing | 1,784 | 24,034 |\n| Interest | 103,957 | 5,02 |\n| Receipts in aid of Superannuation and other allowances | 39,456 | 22,165 |\n| Miscellaneous | 10,473 | 8,944 |\n| Gain by Exchange | 53,087 | 3,955 |\n| Post-Office | 280,835 | 5,713 |\n| Military | 245,797 | 13,119 |\n| Marine | 28,013 | 7,805 |\n| Public Works | 12,104 | 60,998 |\n| Irrigation | 26,726 | 1,471,586 |\n| Telegraph | 156,434 | |\n\n**Total**, Imperial: 9,368,265  \n**Total**, Provincial Funds: 3,433,849  \n**Total**, Local Funds: 418,010\n\n### Expenditure\n\n| Imperial | Provincial Funds | Local Funds |\n|----------|------------------|-------------|\n| Interest on Service Funds | 64,972 | 27,780 |\n| Refunds and Drawbacks | 67,556 | 64,920 |\n| Forests | 111,076 | 18,733 |\n| Salt | 35,554 | 2,470 |\n| Opium | 1,910 | 81,342 |\n| Mint | 41,797 | 55,210 |\n| Administration | 38,401 | 18,598 |\n| Minor Departments | 8,114 | 22,258 |\n| Police | 3,819 | 26 |\n| Marine | 136,583 | 8,927 |\n| Stationery and Printing | 3,700 | 122,533 |\n| Political Agencies | 74,659 | 11,514 |\n| Allowances and Assignments | 132,270 | 521,000 |\n| Civil Furlough Allowances | 1,734 | 405,385 |\n| Superannuation | 71,022 | 7,111 |\n| Miscellaneous | 5,320 | 100,289 |\n| Post-Office | 374,148 | 32,703 |\n| Loss by Exchange | 554,162 | 117,643 |\n| Public Works | 175,757 | 46,025 |\n| Irrigation | 159,738 | 691,393 |\n| Telegraphs | 167,168 | 163,379 |\n| Bombay Army | 5,433,057 | 20,701 |\n| **Total**, Imperial: 7,717,365 | **Total**, Provincial Funds: 1,205,855 | **Total**, Local Funds: 414,674 |\n\n### Municipal Funds\n\n| Bombay Municipality | 325,187 |\n| Other Municipalities | 272,633 |\n| **Total**, Municipal Funds: 597,820 |\n\n**Grand Total**: 13,817,944\n\n*This item shows an increase of \u00a32,271,318 over that of the previous year, due entirely to the war in Afghanistan.*\nRevenue and Expenditure.\u2014The table on the previous page shows the revenue and expenditure of the Bombay Presidency for the year 1880-81, including provincial, local, and municipal funds.\n\nThis table, which has been specially compiled from the materials given in the Administration Report for that year, must not be accepted as an accurate balance-sheet of the finances of the Presidency. For example, the receipts from opium are not, properly speaking, an item of revenue to Bombay, but a tax levied upon the Chinese consumer of a drug which has been produced in Central India. Similarly, on the other side of the account, items of Imperial expenditure, such as the army and interest on debt, are not debited against the Bombay treasury. It must also be observed that the apparently adverse balance in the department of Provincial funds is equalized by a grant of \u00a3982,233 from the Imperial exchequer, which sum is again debited as Imperial expenditure in the Bombay accounts.\n\nEducation.\u2014The educational system in Bombay, as throughout the rest of India, is based upon the celebrated Despatch of Sir Charles Wood, dated 19th July 1854. It consists on the one hand of a widely distributed class of vernacular or village schools, subsidized by grants-in-aid from Government, and under inspection by the Educational Department; and on the other, of a limited number of institutions, which teach in English up to the curriculum of the University, and are for the most part maintained at Government expense. In the year 1880-81, the total number of schools and colleges in the Presidency was 5343, attended on an average by 223,364 pupils daily, showing 1 school to every 23\u00b72 square miles of area, and 13\u00b78 pupils to every thousand of the population. Of the 41,997 towns and inhabited villages contained in the Presidency and its dependencies, 4154, or about 1 in 10, were provided with schools, and the number of scholars on the rolls at the close of the year was 316,974. Of the whole number of schools, 4398 were Government institutions, 255 private institutions receiving aid from Government, 662 were unaided, but under inspection by Government agency, and 28 were police and jail schools. In these figures are included 9 colleges for higher instruction, 7 technical schools, 9 normal schools, 50 high schools for boys, 2 high schools for girls, and 240 middle-class schools, of which 16 are for girls. The total expenditure of the department amounted to \u00a3244,705, of which \u00a3108,912 was derived from Provincial funds, and \u00a3135,793 from Local funds. In addition, a sum of \u00a370,285 was expended the same year on education by the Native States of the Bombay Presidency. The vernacular schools alone numbered 4795, attended by 275,642 scholars. These are mainly supported by an allotment of one-third of the 1 anna cess on every rupee of the land revenue, augmented by the grant of a lump sum from Government. There were 298 primary girls' schools, with\n17,612 pupils, of which nearly one-half are private institutions. Of the total number of the children in schools connected with Government, 212 per cent. were Christians, 22\u00b711 Br\u00e1hmans, 60\u00b796 other Hindus, 11\u00b732 Muhammadans, 2\u00b759 P\u00e1rs\u00eds, and the remainder were Jews, aborigines, and \u2018others.\u2019 Of the principal races that attend the schools in this Presidency, Br\u00e1hmans are the most numerous in proportion to their number, and Hindu cultivators and Muhammadans the least numerous class, except in primary schools, where the proportion of P\u00e1rsi pupils is the smallest. About one-quarter of the pupils attending educational institutions of the higher classes are sons of Government officials; one-eighth sons of persons of property; one-ninth, sons of private clerks; one-sixteenth, sons of merchants, and the remainder sons of cultivators.\n\nThe number of pupils learning English was 22,237, and Sanskrit 3295. The most important colleges are, the Elphinstone College in Bombay city, with an average daily attendance of 158 in 1881-82; the Deccan College at Poona, with 120 pupils; the Guj\u00e1r\u00e1t College, with an average daily attendance of 17; and the R\u00e1j\u00e1ram College, with an average daily attendance of 18. Among institutions for special instruction may be mentioned\u2014the Law School, with 152 students; the Grant Medical College, with 282; and the Poona College of Science, with 188. The Jamsetjee Jeejebhoy School of Art, with 103 pupils, is also under the Education Department. The Bombay University was founded by Lord Elphinstone in 1857. It consists of a chancellor, vice-chancellor, and senate; and its function is to examine and confer degrees in arts, law, medicine, and engineering. Large endowments have been received at different times from the wealthy merchants of Bombay, by means of which a handsome hall and library have been erected on the esplanade.\n\nThe languages spoken in the Bombay Presidency are Mar\u00e1th\u00ed, Gujar\u00e1th\u00ed, Sindh\u00ed, and K\u00e1narese; Urdu or Hindust\u00e1n\u00ed is also in common use among the educated and trading Muhammadans. In the year 1880-81, the total number of publications registered was 980, of which 91 were printed in English, and 889 in Oriental languages. The total number of printing-presses was 74, of which as many as 47 are found in Bombay city, and 20 in the Deccan. The number of native newspapers appearing was 73, either printed or lithographed, of which 2 were entirely in English, 11 Anglo-Mar\u00e1th\u00ed, 30 purely Mar\u00e1th\u00ed, 4 Anglo-Gujar\u00e1th\u00ed, 27 purely Gujar\u00e1th\u00ed, and the remainder in Urdu, Hind\u00ed and Persian. Two of these papers, edited in Bombay city by P\u00e1rsis, have existed for 57 and 45 years respectively. The leading association for the advancement of learning in the Presidency is the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, originally founded in 1804, with which the Bombay Geographical Society was amalgamated in 1874. The Medical and Physical Society was founded in 1863. The Sassoon\nMechanics' Institute has a reference library of 15,000 volumes. There are altogether 90 libraries registered in the Presidency. In the year 1880-81, the post-offices numbered 735, the letter-boxes 1380, and the total mileage of postal lines was 10,493. The post-office received for delivery a total of 28,084,992 articles. The length of telegraph line at the close of the same year was 1930 miles, and the length of wire 6490 miles in Bombay Proper; in Sind the length of line was 1593, and of wire 4518 miles.\n\nMedical Aspects\u2014Climate.\u2014Great varieties of climate are met with in the Bombay Presidency. In its extreme dryness and heat, combined with the aridity of a sandy soil, Upper Sind resembles the deserts of Arabia. The thermometer here has been known to register 130\u00b0 F. in the shade. At Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d, in Lower Sind, the mean maximum temperature during the six hottest months in the year is 98\u00b75\u00b0; the rise of temperature in the water of the Indus is also remarkable. In Cutch and Gujar\u00e1t the sultry heat, if not so excessive, is still very trying. Bombay island itself, though in general cooled by the sea-breeze, is oppressively hot during May and October. The Konkan is hot and moist, the fall of rain during the monsoon sometimes reaching 300 inches. The table-land of the Deccan above the Gh\u00e1ts possesses an agreeable climate, as also does the South Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 country. On the hills of Mah\u00e1baleshwar, Singarh, and other detached heights, Europeans may go out all hours of the day with impunity. According to a series of returns, extending over a period of twenty-eight years, taken at the meteorological station of Kol\u00e1ba, the mean annual temperature is 79\u00b72\u00b0 F., ranging from 73\u00b76\u00b0 in the month of January to 84\u00b72\u00b0 in May; the average annual rainfall is 70\u00b730 inches, of which 70\u00b78 fall in the seven months between May and November. The south-west monsoon generally breaks about the first week in June, and pours down torrents of rain along the coast. From that date up to October the rainy season may be said to last, during which travelling is everywhere difficult and unpleasant, except in Sind, where the monsoon rains exert little influence.\n\nDiseases.\u2014The most prevalent diseases are fevers of various types, including the malarious fevers of Gujar\u00e1t and K\u00e1nara, especially dreaded by Europeans; cholera, which seems to display a curious tendency towards epidemic outbreaks at triennial intervals; bowel complaints, including diarrh\u0153a and dysentery; small-pox, which has recently been checked to some extent by the extension of the practice of vaccination; ague, rheumatic affections, lung diseases, syphilis and various cutaneous disorders. Conservancy arrangements are enforced by the Sanitary and Vaccination Departments, which have been amalgamated, and an official with the title of Deputy Sanitary Commissioner has been placed in every District. The actual outlay in 1880 under\nthe head of sanitary works, military, amounted to \u00a314,069. The vital statistics are recorded in the several municipalities by the municipal officers, and elsewhere by the village head-men and accountants\u2014except in cantonments and in the province of Sind, where, in the absence of a regular village establishment, the work is done by the ordinary revenue officers; they cannot be accepted as accurate, but they give some indication of the relative mortality from different diseases. During 1880-81, 328,673 deaths were registered throughout the Presidency, giving a death-rate of 20\u00b725 per thousand, as compared with an average of 24\u00b735 for the previous nine years. Of the total number of deaths, 246,779 were assigned to fevers, a very vague term among native practitioners; only 684 to cholera, which in 1878 carried off 46,743, and in 1879, 6937 persons; 24,452 to bowel complaints; and 940 to small-pox: 1179 deaths from snake-bite were recorded in the same year. In the same year 370,873 births were registered, showing a birth-rate of 22\u00b785 per thousand. Calculations based upon the ages of the population yield an average death-rate throughout the Presidency of 35\u00b757 per thousand, and a birth-rate of 41\u00b705. In the year 1880-81, the staff of 431 vaccinators performed 704,984 operations at a total cost of \u00a323,714.\n\nCharitable institutions for medical relief consist of two classes. The Civil Hospitals in 1880-81 numbered 43, at which 307,030 patients were treated. The Dispensaries in 1880-81 numbered 144, of which 6 were in Native States; they were attended by 893,366 patients. The total expenditure on these dispensaries was \u00a324,171. There were 5 Lunatic Asylums in the Presidency, with 913 inmates in the year 1881. The expenditure was \u00a39140, or an average of \u00a315 per head.\n\n**Bombay.**\u2014The city of Bombay, the capital of the Presidency of Bombay, and the principal seaport of Western India, is situated on an island in 18\u00b0 55' 5\" N. lat., and 72\u00b0 53' 55\" E. long. Bombay island is one of a group (perhaps that called Heptanesia by Arrian) lying off the coast of the Konkan; but by the recent construction of causeways and breakwaters, it is now permanently united on the north with the larger island of Salsette, and so continuously with the mainland. The remainder of the group of islands constitute a part of Thana District. For certain administrative purposes, Bombay city is regarded as constituting a District by itself, with an area of 22 square miles, and a population, according to the Census of 1881, of 773,196 souls.\n\nBombay island is in shape a trapezoid. It is popularly likened to a hand laid palm upwards, with the fingers stretching southwards into the sea, and the thumb representing Malabar Hill, with Back Bay between the thumb and forefinger. Others see a resemblance in it to a withered leg, with a very high heel and pointed toe, the heel being Malabar Hill, and the toe Kolaba. It is 11\u00bd miles long from the south extremity of Kolaba to Lion Causeway, over which the railway passes to the larger\nisland of Salsette, and from 3 to 4 miles broad in that portion which lies to the north of the esplanade. The portion of Bombay called the Fort, abutting on the harbour, and separated from the native city proper by a large maid\u00e1n or park, is the most important, most English, and busiest quarter of the town.\n\nHistory.\u2014The name of Bombay was erroneously supposed to have been given by the Portuguese, on account of the geographical position of the island\u2014Bom-bahia or Boa-bahia, 'statio fidissima nautis.' Colonel H. Yule, however, traces it back to the latter half of the compound name Tanna-Maiamba or Mayamba, which, according to Barbosa, circ. 1516, was used to designate the kingdom of the Konkan in the 16th century. The name appears as Maimbi in the very early geographical Sommario de Regni, translated from the Portuguese in Ramudio, written probably 1520-25. There can be little doubt that this word, in its turn, was a corruption of Mamba-devi, a goddess who had a famous shrine in the neighbourhood, mentioned in Forbes' R\u00e1s M\u00e1l\u00e1, circ. 1630. The Portuguese of the 16th century call it Mombain or Bombaim, never Bom-bahia or Boa-bahia. The Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 name of Bombay is Mumb\u00e1i, from Mah\u00edm\u00e1, 'Great Mother,' a title of Devi. In support of the popular etymology from Buon Bahia, 'fair haven,' it may be said that Bombay undoubtedly possesses one of the finest harbours in the world. But the evidence leaves little doubt that the true derivation is from the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 Mumbai, i.e. Mah\u00edm\u00e1, 'the Great Mother,' or Dev\u00ed. It thus happens that both the great British capitals of India, Bombay on the western coast, and Calcutta (q.v.) on the eastern, take their names from titles or designations of the same goddess, the wife of Siva, the lord of death and reproduction.\n\nThe history of Bombay begins with the cession of the island by the Portuguese to Charles II. in 1661, as part of the dowry of his queen, Catherine of Braganza. The adjoining islands, however, of Salsette and Karanja still remained in the possession of the Portuguese. At this time the population was estimated at 10,000 souls, and the revenue at 75,000 xeraphins, or \u00a36500. The king appears to have found his distant acquisition unprofitable, and in 1668 he transferred it to the East India Company on payment of an annual rent of \u00a310 in gold. The Company forthwith took steps for the strengthening of the fortifications, and the encouragement of European settlers. Dr. Fryer, who visited the island in 1673, describes the population as numbering 60,000\u2014'a mixture of most of the neighbouring countries, mostly rogues and vagabonds.' He has left an elaborate description of the place as it then existed. The fort or castle was armed with 120 pieces of ordnance; and the town, which lay at some distance, was a full mile in length. The greater number of the inhabitants, especially of the suburb of Mazagon, were engaged in fishing. The Portuguese still\nhad several churches on the island. Between Parel and Mahim, the sea had made a wide breach, drowning 40,000 acres of good land. But the most striking point in all the early accounts is the excessive unhealthiness of the place, which cannot be attributed solely to the mode of life of the residents. Fryer declares it as his opinion that out of every 500 Europeans who came to live on the island, not 100 left it. A current proverb affirmed that two monsoons (or rainy seasons) were the age of a man. The most fatal disease, called by the Portuguese practitioners 'the Chinese death,' has been identified with cholera. The name arose, apparently, from a fanciful French or Latin etymology for the 'mordexim' or 'mor-de-chin,' the old west-coast term for cholera. Garcia d'Orta (1568) distinctly states that it was an Indian word, morxi. It is, in fact, a corruption of the Marathi and Konkani words modachi and modshi, meaning cholera.\n\nIn Fryer's time (1673) the factory of Surat, established sixty years before the cession of Bombay, was the chief possession of the East India Company in Western India. Bombay itself was exposed to the ill-will of the Portuguese on Salsette island, who were able to cut off all direct communication with the mainland. The most formidable enemy, however, was the Sidi or Abyssinian admiral of the Mughal fleet, whose descendants are represented at the present day by the Nawab of Janjira. In 1668, the Sidi wintered at Mazagon, and laid siege to Bombay castle; and the town was only saved by a direct appeal to the Emperor. During this period also, the English in India were greatly hampered by domestic dissensions. In 1684, orders were received to transfer the chief seat of the Company's trade from Surat to Bombay, and the transfer had been effected by 1687. In 1708, the two Companies privileged to trade with the East were fused into the United East India Company, and Bombay was chosen as the seat of one of the three independent Presidencies, each of which was ruled over by a Governor-in-Council. It was not till 1773 that Bombay was subjected to the control of the Governor-General. Henceforth the history of Bombay city merges into that of the Presidency. The only event that need be specially recorded is the first Maratha war (1774-1782), which resulted, after many military vicissitudes, in the permanent occupation by the English of all the Bombay group of islands, and of the town of Thana on the mainland. The city had long been a refuge for the fugitives from Maratha oppression, who could there alone find safety for their industry and commerce; but after the downfall of the Peshwa in 1818, Bombay became the capital of a large territory, and from that year may be dated her pre-eminence in Western India. She was especially fortunate in her early governors. From 1819 to 1830, she was ruled successively by the Hon. Mountstuart Elphinstone and Sir John Malcolm. The first founded the present system of administration; the second, by opening\nthe road through the Bhor-Gh\u00e1t, broke down the natural barrier that separated the sea-coast from the table-land of the Deccan. The next stage in the course of onward prosperity was reached when Bombay was brought into direct communication with Europe through the energy and exertions of Lieutenant Waghorn, the pioneer of the Overland Route. In the early years of the present century, express couriers or adventurous travellers used sometimes to make their way to or from India across the isthmus of Suez, or occasionally even through Persia. A monthly mail service was commenced by way of Egypt in 1838, and the contract was first taken up by the Peninsular and Oriental Company in 1855. Bombay is now recognised as the one port of arrival and departure for all the English mails, and also for the troopships of the Indian army. But the city could not have attained this position, if the means of communication on the landward side had not received a corresponding development. In 1850, the first sod was turned of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, and three years afterwards the line was opened as far as Th\u00e1na, the first railway in the country. By 1863, the railway had been led up the formidable Bhor-Gh\u00e1t to Poona, by a triumph of engineering skill. In 1870, through communication was established with Calcutta, in 1871 with Madras. The city has a successful tramway system. There is now a prospect of more direct railway communication being established, via N\u00e1gpur in the Central Provinces, with Calcutta.\n\nBut it is not only as the capital of a Presidency, or as the central point of arrival and departure for Indian travellers, that Bombay has achieved its highest reputation. It is best known as the great cotton market of Western and Central India, to which the manufacturers of Lancashire turned when the American war cut off their supplies. Even in the last century the East India Company was accustomed to export raw cotton as part of its investment, both to the United Kingdom and to China. This trade continued during the early years of the present century, but it was marked by extreme vicissitudes in quantity and price, the demand being entirely determined by the out-turn of the American crop. The war between the Northern and Southern States was declared in 1861, and the merchants and shippers of Bombay promptly took advantage of their opportunity. The exports of cotton rapidly augmented under the stimulus of high prices, until in 1864-65, the last year of the war, they reached a total value of 30 millions sterling, or nearly ten-fold the average of ten years before. Large fortunes were acquired by successful ventures, and the wild spirit of speculation thus engendered spread through all classes of the community. The scenes of the South Sea Bubble were revived. No joint-stock project seemed too absurd to find subscribers. Banks, financial associations, and land companies, each with millions of\nnominal capital, were started every month, and their shares were immediately run up to fabulous premiums. The crash came in the spring of 1865, when the news was received of the termination of the American war. A panic ensued which baffles description, and the entire edifice of stock exchange speculation came toppling down like a house of cards. Merchants and private individuals were ruined by hundreds, and the quasi-official Bank of Bombay collapsed along with the rest. But despite this sudden flood of disaster, honest trade soon revived on a stable basis; and the city of Bombay at the present day, in its buildings, its docks, and its land reclamations, stands as a monument of the grand schemes of public usefulness which were started during these four years of unhealthy excitement.\n\nGeneral Aspect.\u2014In the beauty of its scenery, as well as in the commercial advantages of its position, Bombay is unsurpassed by any of the cities of the East. The Bombay island, or, as it may now be called, the Bombay peninsula, is connected with the mainland on the north by solid railway embankments. The entrance into the harbour from the sea discloses a magnificent panorama. The background is shut in by the barrier range of the Western Gh\u00e2ts. In front opens the wide harbour, studded with islands and jutting precipices, dotted with the white sails of innumerable native craft, and affording a secure shelter to fleets of tall-masted merchantmen. The city itself consists of well-built houses, and broad streets ennobled by public buildings. The sea-shore is formed by docks, warehouses, and a long line of artificial embankments extending continuously for nearly five miles. On approaching Bombay from the west, there is little to strike the eye. The coast is low, the highest point, Malab\u00e1r Hill, being only about 180 feet above the sea. But on entering the harbour a stranger is impressed with the picturesqueness of the scene. To the west the shore is crowded with buildings, some of them, as Kol\u00e1ba Church and the R\u00e1j\u00e1b\u00e1i clock-tower of the University, very lofty and well-proportioned. To the north and east are numerous islands, and pre-eminent amongst the hills, the remarkable one of B\u00e1ma Malang, otherwise called Mallangarh, on the top of which is an enormous mass of perpendicular rock, crowned with a ruined fort. The harbour is an animated and picturesque scene. There are usually a troopship and a man-of-war of H.M.'s East Indian Squadron, together with numerous large passenger or merchant steamers of the European lines. Among these may be mentioned the Peninsular and Oriental Company's line, the Rubatino (an Italian) line, the British Indian Steam Navigation Company, the Messageries Maritimes, the 'Clan,' 'Anchor,' 'Hall,' and 'National' lines. Many other steamers and merchantmen are to be seen riding at anchor, swinging with the swiftly-flowing tide, and discharging or receiving cargo. All kinds of\nboats, ship's dingies, steam-launches, native 'bunders,' and 'karachis' incessantly ply on the harbour.\n\nThe island consists of a low-lying plain about $11\\frac{1}{2}$ miles long by 3 to 4 broad, flanked by two parallel ridges of low hills. Point Kolaba, the headland formed by the longer of these ridges, protects the harbour on its eastern side from the force of the open sea. The other ridge terminates in Malab\u00e1r Hill; and between the two lies the shallow expanse of Back Bay. On a slightly raised strip of land between the head of Back Bay and the harbour is situated the Fort, the original nucleus round which the town grew up, but now chiefly occupied by stately public buildings and commercial offices. From this point the land slopes westward to the central plain, which, before the construction of the embankment known as the Hornby Velard, was liable to be submerged at high tide. To the north and east, recent schemes of reclamation have similarly shut out the sea, and partly redeemed the foreshore for the use of commerce. In the extreme north of the island a large tract of salt marsh still remains unreclaimed.\n\nThe Government offices, the business houses, and the shops cluster thickly in the part of the city called the Fort. Many of the public and commercial buildings, constructed during the past twenty years, are of splendid dimensions, and have no rival in any other Indian city, except perhaps Calcutta. The houses in the native bazar are also handsomely built, rising three, four, and even six stories in height, with elaborately carved pillars and frontwork. Some of the narrow, unpaved, and crowded streets give an inadequate idea of the real opulence of their inhabitants. But in many of them may be seen evidences of the wealth of the city and of the magnificence of its merchant princes. The most conspicuous line of public buildings is on the esplanade facing Back Bay. Here is the Secretariat, an enormous erection in the Venetian-Gothic style of architecture; the University Senate Hall and clock-tower; the new High Court; the offices of the Public Works Department, the Post and Telegraph Offices. A little inland and behind the Secretariat range of buildings runs the broad thoroughfare of Rampart Row, off which branch many narrow streets containing native and European shops. Rampart Row and its continuation towards the Apollo Bandar (landing-place) form the main line of thoroughfare of the European city of Bombay. Along one side of Rampart Row is a colonnade of arches giving entrance to the Bombay Club, the French Bank, and other buildings. On the opposite side of Rampart Row, which is here fifty or sixty yards broad, rises another line of many-storied offices, chiefly belonging to merchants in grain and cotton. The Fort is illuminated during the night by means of the electric light. Near the Apollo Bandar is the Sailors' Home, erected at the expense of a recent Gaekw\u00e1r of Baroda. Behind\nthe Sailors' Home is the Royal Yacht Club, a favourite resort of Bombay society. At the other end of Rampart Row is a white marble statue of the Queen, under a Gothic canopy, also the gift of the Gaekwar. The most important buildings in the densely-built space occupying the site of the Fort are the circular row of offices and warehouses known as the Elphinstone Circle, the Custom House, the Town Hall, the Mint, and the Cathedral.\n\nThe Castle and Fort St. George are the only two spots now retaining any traces of fortification. The real defences of Bombay consist at present of the two turret ships *Abyssinia* and *Magdala*, armed with 10-inch guns. A scheme for erecting ironclad forts mounted with heavy guns, in mid-channel at the entrance of the harbour, is still under consideration. The existing defences of Bombay Harbour are batteries on rocks, which stud the sea from about opposite the Memorial Church at Kolaba to the Elphinstone reclamation. The one most to the south is called the Oyster Rock, which is 1000 yards from the shore and 8400 feet s.w. of the Middle Ground Battery. The fort on the Middle Ground shoal is in the middle of the anchorage, 1800 yards from shore. The third defence is on Cross Island, at the north end of the anchorage, 100 yards from the shore, and 4000 yards from Middle Ground. There is a battery also on the higher part of the island.\n\nThe private houses of the European residents lie apart from the mercantile and the native quarters of the town. As a rule, each is built in a large garden or compound; and although the style of architecture is less imposing than that of the stately mansions of Calcutta, it is well suited to the climate, and has a beauty and comfort of its own. In former times, the favourite quarter was the northern suburb of Parell, which has contained the official residence of the Governor of Bombay for the last hundred years. At present, the majority of the Europeans live on or around Malabar Hill, now terraced to the top with handsome houses, commanding a magnificent view over the city and the sea. North of Malabar Hill runs another European suburb, known as Breach Candy, where the houses are built close down upon the shore, within the refreshing sound of the waves. Of recent years, both Kumbala Hill, a continuation of Malabar Hill, and the outlying spur of Kolaba are being covered with the residences of Europeans. The Governor has a pretty marine villa at Malabar Point. During the hot-weather months of the early summer, his Excellency and staff, with the Council and chief officers at head-quarters, repair to Mahabaleshwar, and spend the rainy or monsoon season at Poona.\n\n**Population.**\u2014Limiting the area of Calcutta to the municipality, and excluding the suburbs, Bombay ranks as the most populous city in India, and the second in the whole British Empire. According to the\nCensus of 1881, the population of the Bombay municipality, which is co-extensive with Bombay island, in an area of 22 square miles, is \u2014males, 464,763; females, 308,433; total, 773,196, or an average of 33,662 persons per square mile. The total number of houses of all kinds is 29,853 occupied, and 1502 unoccupied, showing an average of 26\u00b735 persons per house. The corresponding average in London is only 7\u00b779. The proportion of males in the total population is 60\u00b70 per cent. The following table gives the population classified according to religion or nationality, with the percentage of each class in the total. The greater bulk of the people is contained in the quarters entitled Dhobi Talao Market, Mandevi, Umarkhari, Bholeshwar, Khetwadi, Kamatipura, Khara, Talao, Byculla, Tarwari, Mazagon, Girgaon, Chaupatti, and Tardeo, which cover an area of about 4 square miles only.\n\n**Population of Bombay City (1881).**\n\n| Religion or Nationality                  | Number   | Percentage |\n|------------------------------------------|----------|------------|\n| Buddhists and Jains                      | 17,387   | 2\u00b72        |\n| Brahmans                                 | 31,199   | 4\u00b70        |\n| Lingayats                                | 1,167    | 0\u00b71        |\n| Rajputs                                  | 3,537    | 0\u00b76        |\n| Hindu Sudras                             | 353,113  | 45\u00b77       |\n| Hindu outcastes                          | 113,835  | 14\u00b77       |\n| Muhammadans                              | 158,713  | 20\u00b75       |\n| Parsis                                   | 48,597   | 6\u00b73        |\n| Jews                                     | 3,321    | 0\u00b75        |\n| Native Christians and Portuguese         | 30,708   | 3\u00b79        |\n| Eurasians                                | 1,168    | 0\u00b71        |\n| Europeans                                | 10,451   | 1\u00b74        |\n| **Total**                                | **773,196** | **100\u00b70** |\n\n* Including 24,887 on board ships and boats in harbour.\n\nHardly any city in the world presents a greater variety of national types than Bombay. The Hindu and the Muhammadan, of course, predominate in numbers, but in the busy streets the characteristic dress of every Oriental people may be seen. The green and gold turban of the Musalm\u00e1n, the large red or white head-dress peculiar to the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1, the pointed red turban of the Guzer\u00e1th\u00ed Baniy\u00e1, and the black or brown brimless hat of the P\u00e1rs\u00ed, lend colour and variety to the scene. The P\u00e1rs\u00eds exercise an influence much greater than is implied by their numbers. When the commerce of Western India deserted Surat in the last century, they settled in Bombay; and now, by the force of their inherited wealth, their natural genius for trade, their intelligence, and their munificent charities, they hold the first place among the native community. Their position was gracefully recognised by the Crown, when Sir Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy received a\nbaronetcy in 1857. The Hindu traders, or Baniy\u00e1s, rank next to the P\u00e1rs\u00eds. They may be divided into two classes\u2014the Baniy\u00e1s of Guzer\u00e1t, and the M\u00e1rw\u00e1ris of Central India. A large proportion of both these classes adhere to the Jain religion, generally regarded as a distinct offshoot of Indian Buddhism; while not a few of the remainder belong to the Vaishnav sect, especially that sub-denomination known as Vall\u00e1bh-ach\u00e1rjyas. The Muhammadans include representatives from all the great countries that have embraced Isl\u00e1m\u2014Arabs, Persians, Turks, Afgh\u00e1ns, Malays, and Africans. The three classes of trading Muhammadans\u2014the Memons, Bor\u00e1hs, and Khoj\u00e1hs\u2014are especially numerous. Their commercial dealings are chiefly with the Persian Gulf, Zanzibar, and the east coast of Africa, while the P\u00e1rs\u00eds and Jews compete with the English in the markets of Europe.\n\nOf the total area of the island, about 8500 acres are assessed as arable land. The chief crop grown is rice; but many varieties of garden vegetables are also cultivated, particularly onions, and several members of the gourd tribe. The rearing of cocoa-nut trees, and the preparation of intoxicating drink from this tree and other species of palms, afford employment to a considerable section of the population. The Bombay mangoes are said to have been improved from grafts by the Jesuits and Portuguese priests. They have long been famous throughout India for their delicate flavour. The Bombay pumalo, a shaddock which looks like a large orange, is also a favourite fruit.\n\nBombay supports all the many industries incidental to the active life of a great city and seaport. The trades of dyeing, tanning, and working in metal are specially prosperous. The School of Art has recently done much to encourage those technical faculties which depend upon an artistic and scientific education. But the characteristic feature of Bombay manufacture is the rapid growth of the European factory system. Mills, worked by steam, and employing a large number of operatives, have been erected by local capital, especially in the northern suburbs, where the tall chimney-stacks recall a factory town in Lancashire. In 1881\u201382, there were 36 mills at work, with a nominal horse-power of 6208, employing 31,801 hands, and a total of 1,056,004 spindles, and 11,274 looms. Sir James Caird has remarked that the monthly wage of a worker in these mills is about equivalent to the weekly wage of a factory hand in Lancashire. The sea-borne commerce of Bombay has been included in the tables given in the previous article for Bombay Presidency. In 1880\u201381, 45,146 sailing ships and 1212 steamers, including foreign and coasting craft, entered the port, with a total tonnage of 2,360,985. The total value of the trade, both imports and exports, was \u00a371,695,017. The principal article of import is cotton piece-goods, valued at \u00a37,303,260; the chief article of export is raw cotton, valued at \u00a39,777,185.\nAdministration.\u2014Besides the High Court, which is a court of first instance for causes arising within the island of Bombay, there are also a Small Cause Court and three Presidency magistrates, having jurisdiction in the city. The total cost of these tribunals, exclusive of the Courts of the Presidency magistrates, was \u00a386,039, of which \u00a351,826 was covered by the stamp revenue on cases decided by them. Excluding the collection of the customs revenue of the port of Bombay, and other items of imperial revenue, such as stamps, excise, and land, amounting altogether to about \u00a3150,000 a year, the civil administration of Bombay city is entrusted to the municipal corporation created by the Acts of 1872 and 1878. One-half the members are elected by the ratepayers, and the rest are nominated by the Government and the Justices of the Peace. The members of the corporation, in their turn, elect eight out of twelve members of a Town Council, by whom the general administration of affairs is controlled. The remaining four members of the Town Council, and the chairman, are nominated by Government. The principal executive officer of the Town Council is the municipal commissioner appointed by Government. In 1881, among a total of 64 members of the corporation, the principal nationalities represented were\u201425 Europeans, 13 Parsis, 14 Hindus, 1 Portuguese, and 3 Muhammadans. Of the 64 members, 16 were official and 48 non-official. The corporation elects its own chairman, and in 1884-85 that position was held by a Parsi barrister. The following table shows the balance-sheet for 1880-81:\n\n### Balance-Sheet of Bombay Municipality for 1880-81.\n\n| Receipts | Expenditure |\n|----------|-------------|\n| House rate, | \u00a389,963 |\n| Government contribution to police, | 7,500 |\n| Wheel-tax, | 23,192 |\n| Liquor licences, | 14,375 |\n| Land conveyance licences, | 84 |\n| Town duties, | 65,778 |\n| Tobacco duty licences, | 16,112 |\n| Contribution from Insurance Companies, | 2,391 |\n| Markets, | 23,238 |\n| Tramway rent, | 2,018 |\n| Public gardens, | 817 |\n| Halalikhor (Scavenger) cess, | 20,305 |\n| Water-rate, | 39,070 |\n| Contributions towards pension, | 938 |\n| Miscellaneous fines, | 1,417 |\n| Fees, | 6,493 |\n| Receipts, | 4,413 |\n| Savings, | 324 |\n| Profit on stores adjusted, | 6,754 |\n| **Total,** | **\u00a3325,182** |\n\n| General superintendence, | \u00a312,849 |\n| Assessment and collection, | 8,601 |\n| Health department, | 69,087 |\n| Market and slaughter-houses, | 6,495 |\n| Engineer's department, | 45,611 |\n| Tobacco duty establishment, | 1,573 |\n| Town duty establishments, | 3,166 |\n| Interest on loans, | 18,140 |\n| Charges on loans, | 1,603 |\n| Sinking Fund, | 8,660 |\n| Primary education, | 1,750 |\n| Gokaldas Tejpal Hospital, | 3,600 |\n| Rent of municipal office, | 3,360 |\n| New works, | 13,724 |\n| Public account, | 38,300 |\n| Lighting, | 26,138 |\n| Waterworks, | 38,870 |\n| Repayment of Drainage Loan, | 2,200 |\n| Other small items, | 1,937 |\n| **Total,** | **\u00a3305,756** |\n\nSurplus on year's revenue for 1880-81, \u00a319,386.\nThe halalkhor (scavenger) cess and the water-rate represent payments for services rendered. Excluding these two items, the receipts of the municipality from taxation amounted to \u00a3265,807, or an average rate of taxation of 8s. 6d. per head. Of the total receipts, 68 per cent. was derived from taxation, 18 per cent. from payments for services rendered, 8 per cent. from municipal property, and 6 per cent. from miscellaneous sources. The total liabilities of the municipality at the end of the year 1881 were \u00a31,191,726, and the total assets (including a cash balance of \u00a376,209) were \u00a31,374,416. About the year 1872, the total rateable value of the city was assessed at \u00a31,155,000, having fallen from \u00a31,630,000 within the previous nine years. The city police in 1880-81 consisted of a strength of 1,423 officers and men, including 293 men paid from imperial sources and employed on harbour duty, or as guards to Government offices; or 65 men to every square mile of area, and 1 man to every 543 of the population. The military force at Bombay on 1st January 1882 consisted of five batteries of artillery, a European regiment, and two and a half battalions of native infantry. The headquarters of the Bombay army are at Poona, and the head-quarters of Bombay District Command only are at Bombay. Education in 1880-81 was represented by 146 schools and colleges, with a total of 16,413 pupils, being 1 school to every 18 square mile, and 21'7 pupils to every thousand of the population. The income of the Bombay Port Trust for the year 1880-81 was \u00a3276,683, and the expenditure \u00a3270,394, inclusive of \u00a3152,656 due as interest on capital, leaving a net surplus of \u00a36288, which was paid away in reduction of loans.\n\nNewspapers.\u2014A vigorous English and vernacular press flourishes in Bombay. The Bombay Gazette and the Times of India, both of them daily journals, well-edited and well-informed, represent the Anglo-Indian community. The Indian Spectator is an excellent native weekly journal in the English language. The Bombay Catholic Examiner ably represents the Roman Catholic inhabitants. The Bombay Chronicle, a native paper, also deserves notice. The vernacular press includes Indu Prakish, Jam-e-Jamshed, Rast Goftar, Bombay Simachar, Arya Patrika, and Gujarathi. These native papers address their respective circles of readers, explaining passing political events, criticising official appointments, and bringing grievances to light.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014Bombay is not so excessively hot as some other parts of India. But on the other hand, it has not the bracing cold weather of the Northern Provinces. The cool months last from November to May. The south-west monsoon begins about the second week in June, and the rain continues with great regularity until the end of September. The hottest months of the year are May and October, but even then the heat is tempered by cool breezes.\nfrom the sea. The average rainfall of the year, as registered at Kok\u00e1ba observatory, is 70.30 inches; the average temperature, 79\u00b02' F. The average death-rate in Bombay city during the five years ending 1880 was 38.10 per thousand. In 1881, a total of 21,553 deaths were registered, of which 529 were assigned to cholera, 37 to smallpox, 6,411 to fevers, and 2,004 to bowel complaints; the death-rate was 27.87 per thousand. The cost of the Public Health Department in 1880 was \u00a369,088, or deducting receipts, \u00a341,090. The health of the city may now be said to have returned to its normal condition before the influx of immigrants from the famine Districts in 1877. The number of births registered in Bombay city in 1881 was 16,381, giving a ratio of 21.19 per thousand. There are 5 civil hospitals in Bombay city, and a dispensary at M\u00e1him, with an average daily number of 612 in-door, and 577 out-door patients. There is a lunatic asylum at Kol\u00e1ba, which contained a daily average of 297.2 inmates in 1880-81, maintained at a cost to the State of \u00a317, 6s. per head. In 1881-82, a staff of 8 vaccinators was employed in Bombay city, who performed 18,869 operations at a total cost of \u00a31608.\n\n**Bomor\u00ed.**\u2014Town in Orchha State, Bundelkhand, Central India Agency. Lat. 25\u00b0 26' 20\" N., long. 79\u00b0 54' 40\" E.; on the road from Agra to S\u00e1g\u00e1r (Saugor), distant from the former 180 miles south-east, from the latter 93 miles north-west. Situated on rising ground, on the bank of an extensive artificial lake, 4 miles in length and 2 in breadth, formed by damming up the course of a small stream, and largely utilized for irrigation. On a rocky ridge overlooking the lake stands the ruined palace of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 who constructed it. Population (1881) 2067.\n\n**Bomr\u00e1j** (Bomr\u00e1z palem).\u2014Estate in Nellore District, Madras Presidency. Formerly, with Venkatagiri, K\u00e1lahasti, and Sayyidpur, constituting the 'District of Western Palayams.' The peculiar revenue and stipendiary usages of this estate form a marked contrast to those in the neighbouring tracts under British administration.\n\n**Bon\u00e1i.**\u2014The most southerly of the Tributary States of Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur, Bengal, lying between 21\u00b0 35' 30\" and 22\u00b0 7' 45\" N. lat., and between 84\u00b0 31' 5\" and 85\u00b0 25' E. long.; area, 1,349 square miles; population (1881) 24,030. Bounded on the north by part of Singbh\u00fam District and by G\u00e1ngpur State; on the south and west by B\u00e1mr\u00e1, a feudatory State of the Central Provinces; and on the east by Keunjhar State, Orissa.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The State is shut in on all sides by the lofty Bon\u00e1i Hills, which occupy so large a portion of the country that only one-twelfth of the entire area is under cultivation. The Br\u00e1hman\u00ed flows from north to south, forming in the centre of the State a fertile and comparatively level tract, in which most of the largest\nvillages are situated. To reach this central valley it passes in a succession of rapids through a beautiful glen 8 miles long. These rapids present difficulties to the floating down of timber; but if they were removed, or canals cut by which they could be avoided, there would be no difficulty in sending the exceedingly valuable stores of sal and other timber which the State contains to False Point by this route. The timber in the Bon\u00e1\u00ed and G\u00e1ngpur forests along the banks of the Br\u00e1hman\u00ed is the most valuable in the Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur Tributary States. Silk cocoons and stick-lac are the most valuable of the jungle products. Iron exists and is melted in the State for local use, but is not exported. Gold is found and washed in small quantities in the beds of the Br\u00e1hman\u00ed and the hill streams. Wild animals\u2014tigers, leopards, wolves, elephants, bison, etc.\u2014are very numerous, and do much damage to the crops.\n\nHistory, etc.\u2014Bon\u00e1\u00ed, together with G\u00e1ngpur and others of the Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur States, was ceded to the British Government in 1803, and restored by a special engagement in 1806. It reverted to the British under a provisional agreement made with Madhuji Bhonsla (Ap\u00e1 S\u00e1hib) in 1818, and was finally ceded in 1826. Besides paying a yearly tribute of \u00a320, the R\u00e1j\u00e1 is bound to furnish, when required, a contingent of armed men for military service. The State yields the R\u00e1j\u00e1 an income of about \u00a3600.\n\nPopulation.\u2014Of the population of 24,030 in 1881, 23,445 were Hindus by religion, and 31 Muhammadans, while 554 were aboriginal or hill tribes belonging to other religions not separately classified. A large number of aborigines by race are included among the Hindus. Number of males, 12,445; females, 11,585. Average density of population, 18 per square mile; number of villages, 256; number of occupied houses, 4372; villages per square mile, 19; houses per square mile, 3'24; persons per village, 94; persons per house, 5'5. Of the Dravidian aborigines, the most numerous are the Bhuiy\u00e1s, who are sub-divided into two clans\u2014the Bhuiy\u00e1s of the plains, and the Pah\u00e1ri or hill Bhuiy\u00e1s. The Bhuiy\u00e1s of the plains are the dominant tribe in most parts of Bon\u00e1\u00ed, and were probably the earliest settlers in the country. They hold fiefs under the R\u00e1j\u00e1, and form, with the Gonds of South Bon\u00e1\u00ed, the organized militia of the State. Hardly any other class of subordinate holders have fixed proprietary rights in the soil; and the R\u00e1j\u00e1 had formerly no right to exercise any authority until he had received the tilak or token of investiture from his Bhuiy\u00e1 vassals. This prerogative is still asserted by the s\u00e1ont or head of the Bhuiy\u00e1 clan in Bon\u00e1\u00ed, who holds 12 villages at a quit-rent of \u00a31, 16s. a year, and claims to be the hereditary diw\u00e1n or finance minister of the State. The present chief, however, does not employ him or acknowledge his claim. Besides their\norganization as a semi-military body, the Bhuiy\u00e1s derive great power from their position as priests of the oldest temples or shrines. These temples, although now dedicated to Hindu deities, bear evidence that they were originally occupied by other images, at a period prior to the introduction of Hinduism. At some of these shrines, human sacrifices were offered every third year; and this practice continued till the country came under British rule. Next in influence to the Bhuiy\u00e1s are the Gonds, also a Dravidian tribe living in the south of Bon\u00e1\u00ed, bordering on B\u00e1mr\u00e1 State in the Central Provinces. Two members of this tribe, called respectively dandp\u00e1t and mah\u00e1p\u00e1tra, hold fiefs on condition of military service under the R\u00e1j\u00e1. The Gonds in Bon\u00e1\u00ed have now become thoroughly Hinduized, and speak no language but Uriy\u00e1. A small sprinkling of Kandhs, so long notorious for their practice of human sacrifice, is found in Bon\u00e1\u00ed. They probably immigrated from Bod State in Orissa, but have long occupied a servile position in Bon\u00e1\u00ed as farm labourers, and have lost all the typical characteristics of their race. Among the Hindus proper, the most noteworthy caste is the Kalita or Kulta. They are peculiar to Sambalpur in the Central Provinces, Bon\u00e1\u00ed, and Assam, and occupy in all three places a very similar position as most respectable and substantial cultivators. The Kal\u00edtas of Bon\u00e1\u00ed resemble in appearance those of Assam, both having strongly-marked Aryan features with hazel or grey eyes, and there appears to be some ethnological connection between the two. The elders of the caste in Bon\u00e1\u00ed, however, assert that they came originally from Mithila, the modern Tirhut, in the days of R\u00e1ma, and settled in Sambalpur, from whence they migrated into Bon\u00e1\u00ed six generations ago. Colonel Dalton, in his Ethnology of Bengal, states that they form the best cultivators and most substantial people in the State. He found them occupying villages along with aboriginal Gonds and Kandhs, but these had nearly all fallen into the position of farm servants to the Kalitas, who had extensive fields, well-stocked farmyards, and comfortable houses. The pardah system of excluding their females is unknown to them, and infant marriage is not practised.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014The principal crops in the State are rice, pulses, and oil-seeds. Systematic cultivation is confined to the valley of the Br\u00e1hman\u00ed river, and, as has been already stated, only one-twelfth of the entire area is under tillage. Three regular rice crops are grown\u2014gor\u00e1 dh\u00e1n, a highland rice, sown in June and reaped in September; autumn rice, also sown in June; and a winter crop, sown in July. Gor\u00e1 dh\u00e1n yields in good seasons 13 or 14 maunds of paddy for every maund of seed sown; but in bad years, or under careless tillage, the out-turn is not more than four or five fold the amount of seed. A fourth rice crop, called d\u00e1hi dh\u00e1n, is grown on forest land by the nomadic hill\ntribes. For this no ploughing is required; the trees are cut down and burned on the land, the ashes being mixed up with the surface soil; and the seed is put in at the commencement of the rains. The out-turn of the dahi crop is from 40 to 45 times the amount of the seed, but after two years the land is exhausted. Wages in Bon\u00e1\u00ed are invariably paid in kind; a male day-labourer receives 2 sers (4 lbs.) of rice a day, and a woman 1\u00bd ser (3 lbs.). Price of best cleaned rice in 1873, 4s. 2d. per cwt.; of common rice, 2s. 1d.; and of coarse unhusked paddy, 1s. 0\u00bdd. per cwt. The principal village of the State is Bon\u00e1\u00ed Garh, the residence of the R\u00e1j\u00e1.\n\nTrade, etc.\u2014Small boats ply on the Br\u00e1hman\u00ed all the year round, and the bulk of the surplus produce of the country is exported to Sambalpur by this route. A portion, however, is carried to the north on pack-bullocks. Iron is smelted for local use, but is not exported. Gold is found in small quantities in the bed of the Br\u00e1hman\u00ed and the hill streams.\n\nThe family of the Bon\u00e1\u00ed chief claim a mysterious and foreign origin. They say that they came from Sakaldwip or Ceylon, and that the founder of the family was abandoned by his mother under a kadamba tree. Being on the point of falling into the hands of an enemy, the infant was rescued by a peacock, which swallowed him, and kept him in its craw until the danger was past. In gratitude for this service, the peacock was adopted as the family crest. In reference to their early connection with the kadamba tree, they describe themselves as kadambans\u00ed R\u00e1jputs. Looking, however, to their position as rulers over powerful Bhuiy\u00e1 vassals, who hold the bulk of the land, command the militia of the State, and have even the right of conferring the tilak or token of investiture on the Chief, there can be little doubt that the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Bon\u00e1\u00ed was originally the tribal head of the Bhuiy\u00e1 clan. If Colonel Dalton\u2019s theory be correct that the Bhuiy\u00e1s formed a portion of the army with which R\u00e1ma invaded Ceylon, and were, in fact, the veritable apes of the R\u00e1m\u00e1yan\u00e1, it would seem as if the family of the Chief had taken advantage of an ancient legend to conceal their aboriginal ancestry under the fiction of Cinghalese descent.\n\nBon\u00e1\u00ed Garh.\u2014Residence of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Bon\u00e1\u00ed State, Chuti\u00e1 Nagpur, Bengal. Lat. 21\u00b0 49\u2032 8\u2033 N., long. 85\u00b0 0\u2032 20\u2033 E.; situated on the Br\u00e1hman\u00ed river, which surrounds the garh or fort on three sides. It is further defended by a high mud-wall and moat. Within this enclosure are about 150 houses, including the palace of the Chief, his court-house and jail. The entire village contains about 300 houses. The site, which is very picturesque, is 505 feet above sea-level.\n\nBon\u00e1\u00ed Hills.\u2014A series of ranges, rising to a height of 2000 and 3000 feet above the central valley of Bon\u00e1\u00ed State, Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur, and shutting it in on all sides. With the countless spurs which they throw\noff, they occupy a large portion of the State. Most of the hills are densely wooded to the summit, and, except at the regular passes, are inaccessible to beasts of burden. Through the northern mountain barrier separating Bond\u00e1da from G\u00e1ngpur State, the Br\u00e1hman\u00ed river has forced its way, passing through a glen 8 miles long. The shortest route from G\u00e1ngpur to Bon\u00e1i is by a rugged path through this glen, but it is only practicable during the dry weather. Principal peaks\u2014M\u00e1nkarm\u00e1ch\u00e1, 3639 feet above sea-level; B\u00e1d\u00e1mgarh, 3525 feet; Kumrit\u00e1r, 3490 feet; Cheli\u00e1toka, 3308 feet; and Kond\u00e1dhar, 3000 feet. Fifteen other peaks are named, each more than 2000 feet in height.\n\n**Bond\u00e1da.**\u2014Village in God\u00e1var\u00ed District, Madras Presidency; paying \u00a3693 per annum as Government assessment. The estate of Bond\u00e1da, consisting of 20 villages, was resumed by Government in A.H. 1864, on account of arrears of revenue.\n\n**Bongong.**\u2014Sub-division of Nadiy\u00e1 District, Bengal.\u2014See Bangaon.\n\n**Bonr\u00e1.**\u2014Marsh in Bogr\u00e1 District, Bengal; locally known as the bar\u00e1 bil, or Great Swamp. It is connected with the Chalan Lake, in R\u00e1jsh\u00e1hi, one of the largest pieces of water of this kind in Bengal.\n\n**Boondee.**\u2014Native State and town in R\u00e1jput\u00e1na.\u2014See Bundi.\n\n**Bor\u00e1g\u00e1ri.**\u2014Trading village and produce d\u00e9p\u00f4t in Rangpur District, Bengal. Lat. 26\u00b0 0' 15\" N., long. 89\u00b0 3' 15\" E. Chief exports\u2014rice, mustard, jute, and gunny-bags.\n\n**Bor\u00e1m.**\u2014Village in M\u00e1nbh\u00fam District, Bengal. Lat. 23\u00b0 22' N., long. 86\u00b0 10' E. Chiefly noteworthy on account of the Jain remains in the neighbourhood, on the right bank of the K\u00e1s\u00e1i (Cossye) river, 4 miles south of the town of J\u00e1ipur. There are many indications that these remains mark the site of what was at one time a very important place. Amidst heaps of d\u00e9bris and ruins stand three fine brick temples, of which the most southerly is the largest. Its tower rises from a base of 26 feet square to a height of (at present) about 60 feet; the upper portion has fallen, but the proportions followed in other temples of the same type, suggest that the original building must have been about one-third higher than the present ruins. The chamber occupies only 9 square feet; the images have been removed. The bricks of which all the temples are made are beautifully fashioned, and appear to have been finished by grinding. In this respect, and in their style of ornament and workmanship, these temples resemble the great Buddhist temple of Buddh Gay\u00e1 in Behar.\n\n**Bor\u00e1s\u00e1mb\u00e1r.**\u2014Estate or zam\u00edn\u00e9d\u00e1ri, formerly belonging to the Eighteen Garhj\u00e1ts, but now attached to Sambalpur District, Central Provinces; situated between 20\u00b0 43' 15\" and 21\u00b0 11' 45\" N. lat., and between 82\u00b0 40' 30\" and 83\u00b0 27' 45\" E. long. Area, 841 square miles, nearly half of which is cultivated, the rest being covered by jungle. Number of villages, 425; occupied houses, 11,965; total population\n(1881) 65,837, namely, 33,762 males and 32,075 females; average density of population, 78 per square mile. The forests contain abundance of sal (Shorea robusta), sij (Pentaptera glabra), and other useful timber, besides lac, and cocoons of the tasar silkworm. Wild beasts are very numerous. In the eastern portion of the estate, a few Kalita and Br\u0101hman families have settled, the former as agriculturists, the latter both as money-lenders and agriculturists. The leading race are the Binjw\u0101rs, an aboriginal tribe who eke out an existence as herdsmen and labourers, and by occasional cultivation. Banj\u0101ras, or carriers trading in salt and cotton with the east coast, are to be found during the monsoon, the grazing for their herds being excellent. A few Saor\u00e1s, Kandhs, and Gonds are to be met with. Artisans are very scarce. The chief crop is rice; but the soil is good, and pulses, oil-seeds, cotton, and sugar-cane, when carefully cultivated, have been found to be successful. Iron-ore is found in considerable quantities. The estimated revenue of the estate is about \u00a31480. Tribute paid to Government, \u00a330.\n\nThe zamind\u0101ri was granted by the Gajapatti ruler of Pur\u012b, between 1500 and 1600 years ago, to Dasmat Barhea, the founder of the present family. The grant was originally limited to a jungle tract near Bor\u00e1s\u0101mbar, but the family have from time to time extended their possessions by annexations from those of neighbouring chieftains, with whom they were constantly at feud.\n\nBor\u012b.\u2014Thriving town in N\u0101gpur District, Central Provinces; on the left bank of the Wana, lying between the Great Southern Road and the railway, about 18 miles from N\u0101gpur. Lat. 20\u00b0 54' 45\" N., long. 79\u00b0 2' 45\" E. Population (1881) 2849, namely, Hindus, 2562; Muhammadans, 201; Jains, 37; aboriginal tribes, 49. A large portion are employed in weaving cloth dyed of a red-brick colour. In consequence of the durability of the dye, which is ascribed to some property in the waters of the Wan\u0101, the cloths of Bor\u012b command a high price. The town has a commodious sar\u0101i, a police station, and a Government school. Some fine groves adorn the northern quarters. Main\u0101 B\u0101l\u012b Nimb\u0101lkar\u1e47, with a garrison of 200 men, successfully held Bor\u012b against three raids of the Pind\u0101ris.\n\nBoria (or Adur).\u2014Seaport in the Chiplun Sub-division, Ratnagiri District, Bombay Presidency, situated midway between the mouths of the V\u0101sishta and Sh\u0101stri rivers. Lat. 17\u00b0 24' N., long. 73\u00b0 13' 15\" E. Average annual value of trade for five years ending 1881\u201382\u2014exports, \u00a31700; imports, \u00a33857. The port is protected by the bold and conspicuous headland of Adur, 360 feet above sea-level, and is a safe anchorage during northerly gales. On the top of the hill overlooking the bay is a station of the Trigonometrical Survey.\n\nBorsad.\u2014Sub-division of Kaira District, Bombay Presidency. Area, 218 square miles, containing 1 town and 89 villages. Population\nof whom 76,595 are returned as males and 66,726 as females. Of Hindus there are 132,174; of Muhammadans, 8386; and of 'others,' 2761. Owing to the intermixture of Baroda and Cambay villages, the Sub-division is very broken and irregular in shape. Of the total area, 56 square miles are occupied by the lands of alienated and unsettled (mehwds) villages. The remainder, according to the revenue survey returns, consists of 92,901 acres of cultivated land, 2597 acres of cultivable land, 2953 acres of uncultivable waste, and 4389 acres of roads, river-beds, village sites, etc. Alienated lands in Government villages occupy 40,698 acres. Of the 54,800 acres of cultivable Government land, 49,035 acres were under tillage in 1876-77.\n\nThe Mahi, the only river in the Sub-division, flows along its southern boundary, and is throughout the whole distance a tidal river. But the shallowness of its channel, its shifting sandbanks, and the force of its tidal wave make it useless for boats. Except in the south, along the banks of the Mahi, the whole Sub-division is a highly-cultivated plain sloping gently westwards, intersected by rich hedgerows, and adorned by groves of magnificent trees. Water-supply good. Net Government assessment, \u00a326,622, or 9s. 8\u00bdd. an acre. The Sub-division contained in 1883, 1 civil and 2 criminal courts; strength of regular police, 100 men; village watchmen (chaukidars), 693.\n\n**Borsad.**\u2014Chief town of the Borsad Sub-division, Kaira District, Bombay Presidency. Lat. 22\u00b0 24' 30\" N., long. 72\u00b0 56' 30\" E. Population (1881) 12,228, namely, 8049 Hindus, 2790 Muhammadans, 1116 Jains, 266 Christians, and 7 'others.' The town is protected by a double line of fortifications, the outer of which is in disrepair, the inner in fair preservation. These fortifications are modern, having been constructed by Ranguji, a Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 leader, who fixed his head-quarters here in 1741. The fort was constantly the scene of fighting till 1748, when, after a siege of five months, the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda captured the town and made Ranguji prisoner. Besides the ordinary sub-divisional courts and offices, the town contains a subordinate judge's court, post-office, dispensary, and 3 Government schools. Borsad is also the seat of a Presbyterian mission.\n\n**Bot\u00e1d.**\u2014Fortified town in the peninsula of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay Presidency. Lat. 22\u00b0 10' N., long. 71\u00b0 42' 30\" E.; population (1881) 7755, namely, 5678 Hindus, 1292 Muhammadans, and 785 Jains.\n\n**Bot\u00e1wad.**\u2014Town in Kh\u00e1ndesh District, Bombay Presidency.\u2014See Botwad.\n\n**Bowring-Pet** (or Maramatlu).\u2014Village in Kol\u00e1r District, Mysore Native State; 10 miles by road south of Kol\u00e1r. Lat. 12\u00b0 59' N., long. 78\u00b0 15' E.; population (1881) 1265. Founded in 1864, on the opening of the railway, and named after Mr. Lewin Bowring, then Chief Commissioner. Includes the former villages of Maramatlu and Hosin-\ngere. Railway station for Kol\u00e1r or Kol\u00e1r Road, and head-quarters of the Betmangala taluk. Weekly fair attended by 1000 persons.\n\nBoyar\u00e1ni.\u2014Town in Ganj\u00e1m District, Madras Presidency. Population (1881) 3339, all Hindus.\n\nBr\u00e1hmagiri (or Maren\u00e1d).\u2014Range of hills which constitutes a natural barrier for several miles between Coorg and the Wain\u00e1d taluk in the District of Malab\u00e1r, Madras Presidency; average height, 4500 feet above the sea. Highest peak\u2014D\u00e1vasi-betta, 5276 feet. Lat. 11\u00b0 56' N., long. 76\u00b0 2' E. The sides are clothed with forest. Among these hills are the sources of some of the principal tributaries of the K\u00e1veri (Cauvery), viz. the P\u00e1pan\u00e1shi (sin-destroyer), Valarpattan\u00e1m, and the Lakshmantirtha river, which flow towards the east; and the Barapol\u00e9, which forces its precipitous course in a north-westerly direction, and through the Per\u00e1mb\u00e1di Pass down to the sea.\n\nBr\u00e1hman\u00e1b\u00e1d.\u2014Ruined city in Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Sind, Bombay Presidency. It stood on the old course of the Indus, and was strongly fortified. Outlying suburbs formerly connected it with the cities of Depur and Dal\u00e1rf,\u2014the former the royal, the latter the official quarter; Br\u00e1hman\u00e1b\u00e1d itself being the commercial centre. The ruins of its fortifications measure 4 miles in circumference. Recent excavations prove that the inhabitants had attained to great skill in the arts, for the sculptures, engraved gems, carved ivory, earthenware, and coloured glass, found among the ruins, show both advanced taste and workmanship; while the arrangement and regularity of the streets, and the solid proportions of the buildings, attest great architectural excellence. Legends say that the city was founded prior to the 7th century, and was destroyed by the gods in punishment for the iniquities of \u2018King Dolora.\u2019 History so far confirms this tradition as to make mention of an unjust ruler, by name Dolora Amr\u00e1ni, in the 11th century. That the destruction of the city was as sudden as it was complete, is proved by the discovery of whole households overwhelmed together, men and women at their work, and cattle in their stalls. No marks of conflagration are discernible, nor\u2014since household goods and valuables remain in situ\u2014can the ruin of the city be referred to the invasion of an enemy, or desertion by the inhabitants. The legend, therefore, is probably so far correct, that Br\u00e1hman\u00e1b\u00e1d was destroyed by natural agency\u2014most probably by the earthquake which about the same date diverted the course of the Indus.\n\nBr\u00e1hmanakraka.\u2014Village in Nellore District, Madras Presidency. Houses, 705. Population (1881) 3284, namely, 3169 Hindus and 115 Muhammadans. Up to 1790 it gave its name to a taluk of the District.\n\nBr\u00e1hman\u00e1b\u00e1ri\u00e1.\u2014Sub-division of Tipperah District, Bengal, lying between 23\u00b0 35' 45\" and 24\u00b0 16' 30\" N. lat., and between 90\u00b0 45' 45\"\nand $91^\\circ 22' 15''$ E. long. Area 769 square miles; number of towns and villages, 1394; number of houses, 66,105, of which 64,386 are occupied and 1719 unoccupied. Population (1881) 531,417, namely, Hindus, 234,171; Muhammadans, 297,194; and Buddhists, 52; average density of population, 691 per square mile; villages per square mile, 1.81; persons per village, 381; houses per square mile, 89.3; inmates per occupied house, 8.25. The Sub-division was formed in 1860, and consists of the three th\u00e1n\u00e1s (police circles) of Kasb\u00e1, Gauripur\u00e1 (or Nabinagar), and Br\u00e1hmanb\u00e1ri\u00e1. In 1883, it contained 2 magisterial and revenue and 5 civil courts, a regular police force of 78 officers and men, and a village watch of 873 men.\n\nBr\u00e1hmanb\u00e1ri\u00e1.\u2014Town and head-quarters of Br\u00e1hmanb\u00e1ri\u00e1 Sub-division, in Tipperah District, Bengal; situated on the north bank of the Tit\u00e1s river. Lat. $23^\\circ 58' N.$, long. $91^\\circ 9' E.$; population (1881) 17,438, of whom 11,976, or 65 per cent., are Hindus, and 5462 Muhammadans; number of males, 8639\u2014females, 8799; municipal income in 1881\u201382, \u00a3476; incidence of municipal taxation, 6\u00bdd. per head of population within municipal limits. Considerable trade in rice; lock-up and dispensary.\n\nBr\u00e1hman\u00ed.\u2014River of Bengal, formed by the junction of the South Koel and the S\u00e1nkh rivers. These rivers meet in G\u00e1ngpur State, Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur; and the united stream, assuming the name of Br\u00e1hmani, passes through Bon\u00e1i State, Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur, and the Orissa States of Talcher and Dhenk\u00e1nal, and enters Cuttack District near Garh Balr\u00e1mpur. It then follows a very winding course from west to east, and reaches the Bay of Bengal by two mouths, the Dh\u00e1mr\u00e1 estuary and the Maipar\u00e1 river, in $20^\\circ 46' 45''$ N. lat., and $86^\\circ 58' 39''$ E. long. The principal branch of the Br\u00e1hmani on its right bank in Cuttack District is the Kimiri\u00e1, which takes off opposite R\u00e1jendr\u00e1pur village, and, after mixing its waters with the Geng\u00fat\u00ed, Kelo, and Bir\u00fap\u00e1, falls again into the parent stream at Indpur. As it approaches the sea, the Br\u00e1hmani receives as a tributary the Kharsua, and a short distance above this point its waters unite with those of the Baitarani, forming the Dh\u00e1mra. The confluence of the South Koel and the S\u00e1nkh\u2014i.e. the point of origin of the Br\u00e1hmani\u2014is the prettiest spot in G\u00e1ngpur State, and is said by local tradition to be the scene of the amour of the sage Par\u00e1sara with the fisherman\u2019s daughter, Matsya Gandh\u00e1, who became the mother of Vy\u00e1sa, the reputed compiler of the Vedas and the Mah\u00e1bharata.\n\nBrahmapuri.\u2014Sub-division or tahsil of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 District, Central Provinces, lying between $19^\\circ$ and $20^\\circ 44' 15''$ N. lat., and between $79^\\circ 27'$ and $80^\\circ 24'$ E. long. Area, 3321 square miles, comprising 1281 square miles of Government land, and 15 zamind\u00e1ri estates, with a total area of 2049 square miles; number of villages, 1262; number\nof houses, 61,234, of which 57,965 are occupied, and 3,269 unoccupied; population (1881) 257,205, namely, 129,020 males and 128,185 females; average density of population, 77\u00b745 per square mile. Total Government land revenue, including cesses, \u00a39789; total rental paid by cultivators, \u00a317,363, or an average of 1s. 6d. per cultivated acre. The Sub-division contains 1 civil and 1 criminal court; number of police stations (th\u00e1n\u00e1s) 3, with 6 outpost stations; strength of regular police, 94 men; village watchmen (chaukid\u00edrs), 201.\n\nBrahmapuri.\u2014Town in Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 District, Central Provinces, and head-quarters of Brahmapur\u00ed tahs\u00edl. Population (1881) 4818, namely, Hindus, 4272; Muhammadans, 307; and aboriginal tribes, 239. The town is prettily situated on undulating rocky ground, surrounded with picturesque groves. In the highest part is an old fort, the walls of which have been levelled, and on their site stand the court-house, school, and police station. Manufacture of fine cotton cloth and thread, excellent brass and copper utensils, and good bullock-carts. Post-office and dispensary.\n\nBrahmaputra (literally, \u2018The Son of Brahma or God\u2019).\u2014A river of Tibet and North-Eastern India, flowing through the Provinces of Assam and Bengal, which, for its size and utility to man, ranks among the most important in the world. Its total estimated length is about 1800 miles, and its drainage area about 361,200 square miles. In its upper portion in Tibet, it is supposed to take its rise from a small lake on the south-eastern base of the sacred Kail\u00e1s hill, on the opposite side of the same water-parting in which two other of the great rivers of India\u2014the Sutlej and the Indus\u2014also take their rise. The source of the Brahmaputra, or Sanpu, as it is called in Tibetan territory, is in about latitude 31\u00b0 30' N., and longitude 82\u00b0 E., in the vicinity of the great lakes of M\u00e1nasarowar and Long-cho or Rakhas T\u00e1l, in the Hundes country. It flows eastwards down the Sanpu valley, passing not far to the north of Lhassa, the religious capital of Tibet; and about 800 miles of its course are spent in the hollow trough north of the main Him\u00e1layan range. After receiving several tributaries from the confines of the Chinese Empire, the river twists round a lofty eastern range of the Him\u00e1layas; and after leaving Tibet, flows through an unexplored and unknown country, inhabited by rude and savage tribes, until it apparently emerges as the Dihang or Dihong in the north-east corner of Assam, and enters British territory under that name.\n\nThe connection of the Dihang with the Sanpu has not yet been determined by actual exploration, but it is now generally agreed that the two are different sections of the same stream; although D\u2019Anville, Dalrymple, and certain French geographers were disposed to regard the Sanpu as the upper channel of the Irawadi, or great river of Burma.\nThis view is also taken by a recent writer, Mr. R. Gordon, C.E., in an exhaustive Report on the 'Hydrography and Hydraulics of the Irawadi.' Our ignorance of the geography of this interesting region may be assigned to a variety of causes. It is inhabited by savage tribes, who are sufficiently under the influence of Tibet to resist all advances on the part of Europeans, and who have ere now murdered adventurous travellers. It is also an exceedingly difficult country to traverse, being obstructed by rocky precipices and narrow chasms, where none but the practised mountaineer can make his way. There is little hope of a trade route in this direction between India and China. A recent survey in the cold weather of 1878, under the direction of the late Captain Harman, R.E., followed the Sanpu considerably to the east of the portion previously explored, and lower down in the course of the river, bringing the survey down to Gyala Sindong, a fort situated within 100 miles of the highest point reached in the survey of the Dihang river from the Assam side. Captain Harman's survey has strengthened the hypothesis that the Dihang is the continuation of the Tibetan Sanpu. This, however, must remain an hypothesis until further explorations are made, or logs of timber can be floated down from Gyala Sindong into the Dihang. If it could be arranged that a number of logs, specially marked, were floated down from Gyala Sindong, and that these logs were found to emerge in the Assam valley, the question whether the Sanpu eventually enters the Brahmaputra or the Irawadi would be conclusively disposed of, even without further surveys.\n\nThe Dihing, shortly after debouching upon the Assam valley, is joined by the waters of the Dibang and the Brahmaputra of the Hindus (known as the T\u00e1luka in the upper portion of its course), which issue from the Abar and Mishmi hills, in latitude $27^\\circ 76'$ N., and longitude $95^\\circ 30'$ E., about 24 miles west of Sadiy\u00e1. Each of these brings down a large volume of water. The T\u00e1luka, though apparently the smallest of the three streams, has been selected by Hindu tradition as the headwaters of the sacred river. Just below the rapids which it forms on debouching from the mountains, there is a large and deep pool called the Brahmakund, the resort of pilgrims from the farthest corners of the Indian peninsula. From the point of confluence of the three rivers, the united stream takes its well-known name of Brahmaputra, literally the Son of Brahma, the Creator. Its summer discharge at Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1, at the Bengal end of the Assam valley, has been computed at 146,188 cubic feet per second. This calculation, which was made over 40 years ago, appears from later inquiries to be an under-estimate. During the cold season of 1877-78, experiments were made by the late Captain Harman, of the Survey Department, for the purpose of calculating the discharges of the Brahmaputra and its tributary, the Subansiri, at the upper end of the valley near Dibrugarh. The result\nof these operations was a discharge from the former river, at the mean low water level of the year, of 116,484 cubic feet per second, and for the latter of 16,945 cubic feet, giving a total for both of 133,060 cubic feet, or only 13,128 cubic feet less than the formerly computed discharge at Go\u00e1lp\u00e1ra, about 300 miles lower down the valley, after the river has been joined by several large tributary streams. During the rains the river rises 30 or 40 feet above its ordinary level, and its flood discharge at Go\u00e1lp\u00e1ra is estimated at over 500,000 cubic feet per second.\n\nThe united stream forming the Brahmaputra at once assumes in the valley of Assam the characteristics by which it is generally known. It rolls along through the plain with a vast expanse of water, broken by innumerable islands, and exhibiting the operations of alluvion and diluvion on a gigantic scale. It is so heavily freighted with silt from the Him\u00e1layas, that the least impediment in its stream causes a deposit, and may give rise to a wide-spreading almond-shaped mud-bank. Steamers anchoring near the margin for the night are sometimes found aground next morning on an accumulation of silt caused by their own obstruction to the current. On either side, the great river throws out large branches, which rejoin the main channel after a divergence of many miles. The most important of these divergent channels is the Loh\u00edt, which takes off from the main stream, under the name of the Kherkutia Suti, opposite Buri Dihing-Mukh. It receives the great volume of the Subansiri, and is then called the Loh\u00edt; but it seems probable that this is merely an alternative name for the Brahmaputra. The Loh\u00edt, thus reinforced, rejoins the main stream nearly opposite Dhansir\u00ed-Mukh, and the great island char of M\u00e1jul\u00ed, with an area of 441 square miles, is enclosed between it and the main stream. Another large divergent channel of the Brahmaputra is the Kalang, which takes off from the south bank opposite Bishn\u00e1th in Darrang District, and traverses the whole of Nowgong District west of that point, rejoining the Brahmaputra, after a very tortuous course, a short distance above Gauh\u00e1t\u00ed town.\n\nUnlike many rivers that flow through flat low-lying plains, instead of creeping along in a sluggish channel, the Brahmaputra in the Assam valley has a comparatively swift current, and possesses no high permanent banks. At certain points in its course, it passes between or by rocky eminences, which give a temporary fixity to its channel, as at Bishn\u00e1th, Silgh\u00e1t, Tezpur, Singri-parbat, Gauh\u00e1t\u00ed, H\u00e1thimora, Go\u00e1lp\u00e1ra, and Dhubr\u00ed. Where not so controlled, it sends its shifting channels over a vast extent of country, without forming any single continuous river trough.\n\nAfter a course of 450 miles south-west down the Assam valley, the Brahmaputra sweeps southward round the spurs of the G\u00e1ro Hills, which form the outwork of the watershed separating the Brahmaputra of Assam from the Sylhet river system of the B\u00e1rak. Its southerly\ncourse continues thence for about 180 miles, under the name of the Jamun\u00e1, through the open plains of Eastern Bengal, as far as its confluence with the Padm\u00e1, or main stream of the Ganges, at Go\u00e1l\u00e1nd\u00e1, in latitude 23\u00b0 50' N., and longitude 89\u00b0 46' E. From that point, the conjoint deltas of these two rivers may be said to commence. The great bulk of the waters of the Brahmaputra flow towards the southwest; but before they reach the sea, they receive the drainage, by way of the Surm\u00e1 valley, of the eastern watershed between Bengal and Burm\u00e1. That drainage collects into the Meghn\u00e1 river (q.v.), itself a broad and magnificent sheet of water.\n\nShortly after leaving Assam, what is now the chief channel of the Brahmaputra takes the name of the Jamun\u00e1\u2014an alteration of nomenclature representing a mighty change in the course of the river within the last hundred years. The old bed of the Brahmaputra, the only one recognised by Major Rennel in 1765, lies to the east, and still brings down a portion of the parent stream\u2014retaining the original name\u2014past Nasir\u00e1b\u00e1d, the civil station of Maimansingh District. It reunites with the Jamuna or larger body of the Brahmaputra by means of the Meghn\u00e1. In fact, the entire lower portion of the Brahmaputra may be described as an elaborate network of interlacing channels, many of which run dry in the cold season, but are filled to overflowing during the annual period of inundation. Numerous islands are formed by the river during its course, one of them, the M\u00e1juli char in the Assam District of Sibs\u00e1g\u00e1r, covering an area of 441 square miles, and mainly formed by the silt brought down by the Subans\u00edr\u00ed; others are mere sandbanks deposited during one rainy season, only to be swept away by the inundations of the following year. The only towns of importance situated on the banks of the main river, are Gauh\u00e1t\u00ed, Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1, and Dibrugarh; but there are numerous trading marts or river-side dep\u00f4ts for produce, the principal of which are enumerated below. The more important tributaries of the Brahmaputra proceeding down stream, and excluding the three headwaters already mentioned as uniting to form the main river near Sadiy\u00e1, are\u2014the Subans\u00edr\u00ed, Bhorol\u00ed, Man\u00e1s, Gad\u00e1dhar or Sankos, Dharla, and T\u00edst\u00e1 on the right bank; and the No\u00e1 Dihing, Bur\u00ed Dihing, Disang, Dikhu, Dhansiri, and Kalang, with its tributary the K\u00e1pf\u00edl, on the left bank,\u2014for an account of each of which see the separate articles under their alphabetical headings. All these rivers are navigable by large-sized cargo boats, and many of them are open to steamers during the rainy season.\n\nIn its agricultural and commercial utility, the Brahmaputra ranks after the Ganges, and equal with the Indus, among the rivers of India. Unlike these two rivers, however, its waters are not largely utilized for the purpose of artificial irrigation, nor are they confined within embankments. The natural overflow of the periodic inundation\nis sufficient to supply a soil which receives in addition a heavy rainfall; and this natural overflow is allowed to find its own lines of drainage. The plains of Eastern Bengal, watered by the Brahmaputra, yield abundant crops of rice, jute, and mustard, year after year, without undergoing any visible exhaustion; the valley of Assam is not less fertile, although scantily populated, and by a less industrious race. The Brahmaputra itself is navigable by steamers as high up as Dibrugarh, about 800 miles from the sea; and in its lower reaches its broad surface is covered with country craft of all sizes and rigs, down to dug-out canoes and timber rafts. It is remarkable, however, that comparatively little boat traffic is carried on the Brahmaputra within the Assam valley. Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1 is the great emporium of the boat trade, and Gauh\u00e1t\u00ed is ordinarily the extreme point reached by boats of large burthen. Higher up they are almost unknown, and the only craft, except steamers, to be seen on the river are mere dug-outs. All the boats which resort to Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1 and Gauh\u00e1t\u00ed come from Bengal.\n\nThe largest emporium of trade on the river is Sir\u00e1jganj (q.v.), in the Bengal District of Pabn\u00e1, where the agricultural produce of the surrounding country is collected for transmission to Calcutta. The downward traffic consists chiefly of tea, oil-seeds, caoutchouc, and raw cotton from Assam; and jute, oil-seeds, tobacco, rice, and other food-grains from Eastern Bengal. The imports up-stream are European piece-goods, salt, hardware, rice, tea-seed, liquors, etc. Two river steam companies, the India General Steam Navigation Company, and the River Steam Navigation Company, have for several years past kept up a weekly line of steamers, running from Calcutta to Dibrugarh and back. The advertised time-tables give 25 days for the up, and 20 for the down journey, but these dates are not very accurately kept. Nine days on both the up and down journeys are occupied between Calcutta and Go\u00e1l\u00e1nd\u00e1. But the latter place, being connected with Calcutta by the Eastern Bengal Railway, is virtually the starting-point for the up, and the terminus for the down journey, both for passengers and for a considerable portion of the cargo. Besides these two steamer lines, the Assam Railways and Trading Company was established in 1881 to work a coal, timber, and petroleum concession, and to construct a railway in Lakhimpur District. It runs steamers between Dibrugarh and Calcutta, but as yet (1883) not at regular dates. A special daily steamer service for Assam, from the terminus of the Kaunia branch of the Northern Bengal Railway system at Dhubr\u00ed to Dibrugarh, has been organized under contract with the local Government by Messrs. Macneil & Co., a large Calcutta firm; and steamers commenced running about the middle of 1883. The upward voyage from Dhubr\u00ed to Dibrugarh occupies 4, and the downward 3 days. The principal dep\u00f4ts and trading marts, which are also stopping-places for steamers on the\nBrahmaputra, are as follow, proceeding down stream:\u2014Dibrugarh; Dihing-mukh; Disang-mukh or Dikhu-mukh, for Sibs\u00e1gar; Kokila-mukh, for Jorh\u00e1t and North Lakhimpur; Nigriting, for Gol\u00e1gh\u00e1t; Dhansiri-mukh; Bishn\u00e1th; Kaliabar or Silgh\u00e1t, for Nowgong; Tezpur; R\u00e1ng\u00e1mati, for Mangaldai; Gauh\u00e1ti; Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1; and Dhubr\u00ed. These are all in the Assam valley. The Bengal stations are K\u00e1l\u00edganj, Sir\u00e1j-ganj, Bar\u00eds\u00e1l, and N\u00e1lchiti. Steamers do not always call at all the above stations; and there are a few minor places where they stop when specially required.\n\nBr\u00e1huis, The.\u2014The inhabitants of the highlands of Bal\u00fach\u00edst\u00e1n, whose ruler is the Kh\u00e1n of Khel\u00e1t. Masson states that the word Br\u00e1hui is a corruption of Ba-roh-i, meaning literally \u2018of the hills or waste,\u2019 and that the race entered Bal\u00fach\u00edst\u00e1n originally from the west. Dr. Caldwell supposes them to be a Dravidian race, and one of their tribes claims to have come from the shores of the Mediterranean. Their language, which is known as Br\u00e1huiki, is altogether void of affinity with the Persian, Pushtu, or Bal\u00fach\u00ed. It contains a Dravidian element, derived perhaps from some of their first tribes, or offshoots of other races, being engrafted on a stock akin to that which peopled Southern India. The discovery of this element beyond the Indus river indicates that some of the Dravidians, like the Aryans, the Scythians, and the Turco-Mongolians, entered India by the north-west route. The Br\u00e1huis themselves believe and state that they are the aborigines of the country which they now occupy, and that their forefathers came from Halb and Aleppo. Dr. Cook believes that the Br\u00e1huis were Tartar mountaineers, who settled at a very early period in the southern parts of Asia, where they led an ambulatory life in khels, or societies, headed and governed by their own chiefs and laws till at length they attained a footing in Bal\u00fach\u00edst\u00e1n, ultimately supplanting the former inhabitants, whom he supposes to have been of Hindu origin. Pottinger states that their language contains many ancient Hindu words, and he believes that it belongs either to the Scythic, or Turanian, or Tamilian stock. The Saka\u00e9 who formed part of Alexander\u2019s army, and whose country is stated by Wilson to have been that lying between the Paro-pamisus mountains and the Sea of Aral, are said to still exist as a tribe of the Br\u00e1huis of Jh\u00e1l\u00e1w\u00e1n. It is not improbable that they accompanied Alexander as far as the south of Sind, and returning with Craterus up or through the M\u00fala pass, settled in their present position.\n\nThe Br\u00e1huis are most numerous in the provinces of Jh\u00e1l\u00e1w\u00e1r and S\u00e1r\u00e1w\u00e1r, and the number of their tribal divisions is great. Pottinger gives the names of no fewer than seventy-four, each division being ruled by its own Wahdera or chief. They are as a race essentially nomadic, and reside in tom\u00e1ns, or collections of tents made of goat\u2019s-hair, black or striped. The furniture of the ordinary tent usually consists of a few\nmetal cooking-pots, a stone hand-mill, some rough carpets or rugs, a distaff for spinning wool, and a pipe or hukka. A chief's tent may be a little better furnished, and he is generally richer than his neighbours in flocks and herds. Dissensions are common, but the Br\u00e1hui tribes are on the whole more compact and united than those of Afgh\u00e1n\u00edst\u00e1n. They are Sunn\u00ed Muhammadans of the H\u00e1nb\u00e9li sect, but not fanatical; nor have they any religious men, whether Sayyad, p\u00edr, mulla, or fakir. They consider themselves peculiarly favoured Muhammadans, as the Prophet, mounted on a dove, paid them a visit one night, and left a number of saints behind him for their guidance. Forty of these lie buried under a mountain, called Chihal Tau, or the 'Mountain of Forty Bodies,' to the north of Bal\u00fach\u00edst\u00e1n, a place held sacred and visited not only by Muhammadans of other tribes, but by the Hindus also.\n\nIn appearance, Br\u00e1huis are easily distinguishable from Path\u00e1ns, and also from their Bal\u00fach fellow-subjects. They are smaller and sparer than the inhabitants of Afgh\u00e1n\u00edst\u00e1n, and their features are often blunt and irregular. Their faces perhaps show more intelligence than the Path\u00e1n physiognomy. Their hair and beards are frequently brown. They have great physical strength, and are hardier than the Bal\u00fach\u00eds. They tolerate the scorching sun of Kach-Gand\u00e1va, equally with the cold and frost of their own mountains. They are good workers, many of them in the plains to the south of Khel\u00e1t being agricultural labourers. The activity and endurance of the Br\u00e1huis is far superior to that of the inhabitants of Southern Afgh\u00e1n\u00edst\u00e1n, to whom they are not inferior in courage; and though as avaricious as the Path\u00e1ns, they are less revengeful, less quarrelsome, and more trustworthy. They do not possess the wild chivalry which distinguishes the Bal\u00fachi, but they have none of the cold-blooded treachery of the Afgh\u00e1n race. They are keen hunters, and almost without exception good shots. The Jh\u00e1l\u00e1w\u00e1rs claim to excel in the use of firearms, while the S\u00e1r\u00e1w\u00e1rs are superior with the sword. The Br\u00e1hui chiefs have considerable power; and their women are but slightly, if at all, secluded.\n\nThe ordinary dress of the Br\u00e1huis is the same for summer or winter. It is made up of a tunic or shirt, generally ornamented with a little red embroidery; trousers often gathered in about the ankle, but without any resemblance to the extravagantly wide pantaloons among Path\u00e1ns; and a brown greatcoat or cloak, usually of felt. A kammar-band is worn round the waist. The head-dress is a round or pointed skull-cap, without a pagri or turban, but with a small tassel, tuft, or button affixed to the centre of the crown, those of the higher classes being elaborately ornamented with gold thread. A few wear turbans. Square-toed chapplis, or sandals of deer or goat skin, are worn by all classes. Their arms are a matchlock, sword, and shield; pistols are carried by the\nwell-to-do, and the wealthy have rifles. The Afgh\u00e1n knife is unknown, and for the spear they profess contempt.\n\nBr\u00e1huis are not averse to military service, and there are a few in the so-called Bal\u00fach regiments (27th, 29th, and 30th Bombay Native Infantry); but as enlistment in the British Bombay service is practically for life, the best men hold aloof.\n\nThe representative of the Br\u00e1huis in politics is the Kh\u00e1n of Khel\u00e1t, himself a Br\u00e1hui, and a lineal descendant of Kumbar, the head of one of their chief tribes, the Kumbar\u00e1n\u00ed. This tribe is divided into three distinct ranks, namely, the Ahmadz\u00e1\u00eds, the Kh\u00e1n\u00ed, and the Kumbar\u00e1n\u00ed. The Kumbar\u00e1nis only partially intermarry with the other two, i.e. they receive wives from them, but not husbands.\n\n**Brind\u00e1ban.**\u2014Town and municipality in Muttra (Mathur\u00e1) District, North-Western Provinces, situated on the right bank of the Jumna, in a peninsula formed by a northward bend of the river, 6 miles north of Muttra. Lat. $27\u00b0\\ 23' \\ 20''$ N., long. $77\u00b0\\ 44' \\ 10''$ E. Population (1881) 21,467, namely, 20,629 Hindus, 794 Muhammadans, 32 Jains, and 12 Christians; area of town site, 486 acres. Municipal revenue in 1881-82, \u00a32085, of which \u00a31828 was derived from octroi, or an average of 1s. 8\u00bdd. per head of municipal population (21,467). Brind\u00e1ban ranks amongst the holiest cities of the Hindus, and contains a large number of temples, shrines, and sacred sites. Among the most noticeable may be mentioned the temple of Gobind Deva, erected in 1590 by R\u00e1j\u00e1 M\u00e1n Singh of Ambar, governor of K\u00e1b\u00fal and Behar under Akbar, which was originally capped with five towers, all now destroyed. Government has recently repaired the temple at a cost of about \u00a33400, and in 1883 a further sum was devoted to the same purpose. Among the other principal shrines are the temple of Madan Mohan, a form of Krishna, on the river bank, at the upper end of the town; that of Gopin\u00e1th, built by R\u00e1esili-Ji about 1580; and the great temple of the Seths, dedicated to Rang-Ji, and constructed between 1845 and 1851 at a cost of 45 l\u0101khs of rupees (say, \u00a3450,000). Handsome gh\u00e1ts or flights of stone bathing-steps line the bank of the Jumna; and above, the temples and houses rise picturesquely with decorated fa\u00e7ades. The Khusal-bagh is a picturesque garden surrounded with a masonry wall, and is situated close to the town. Ahaliya B\u00e1i, the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 queen of Indore, built a large well of red sandstone, with 57 steps leading down to the water's edge. Two other tanks, known as the Brahma-K\u00fand and the Govind-K\u00fand, possess great sanctity for Hindus. Many private houses are built of hewn sandstone. Anglo-vernacular school, and dispensary. Brind\u00e1ban is one of the great places of pilgrimage of India, and is annually resorted to by thousands of Hindus from the most distant provinces. It is now easily reached\nby the branch line from the East India Railway to Muttra city, only 6 miles from Brind\u00e1ban.\n\n**Broach (Bharuch).**\u2014British District in the Northern Division of the Bombay Presidency, lying between $21^\\circ 26'$ and $22^\\circ 5'$ N. lat., and between $72^\\circ 34'$ and $73^\\circ 12'$ E. long.; area, 1453 square miles; population according to the Census of 1881, 326,930 souls. The District is bounded on the north by the river M\u00e1hi, which separates it from the territory of Cambay; on the east and south-east by the Native States of Baroda and R\u00e1jpipla; on the south by the river Kim, which separates it from Surat District. To the west lies the Gulf of Cambay, along the shore of which the District stretches for a distance of 54 miles. Number of villages on the Government rent-roll, 405. Land revenue (1880-81) \u00a3224,278; total revenue (gross) \u00a3253,581.\n\n**Physical Features.**\u2014The District forms an alluvial plain 54 miles in length, sloping gently westwards to the shores of the Gulf of Cambay (Khambh\u00e1t), and varying in breadth from 20 to 40 miles. With the exception of a few hillocks of sand-drift along the line of coast, and some mounds in the neighbourhood of Broach city, the level of the plain is unbroken by any rising ground. The M\u00e1hi and Kim\u2014the former a river of 300 miles in length, with a drainage area estimated at from 15,000 to 17,000 square miles; and the latter with a course of 70 miles and a drainage area of about 700 square miles\u2014form respectively the northern and southern boundaries of the District. Between these limits are two other rivers which discharge their waters through the Broach plain into the Gulf of Cambay\u2014the Dh\u00e1dhar about 20 miles south of the M\u00e1hi, and the Narbad\u00e1 (Nerbudda) between the Dh\u00e1dhar and the Kim. The Dh\u00e1dhar passes through the Broach plain for 24 miles, or about one-third of the entire length of its course; and the Narbad\u00e1, with a total length of between 700 and 800 miles, and a drainage area estimated at about 36,400 square miles, flows for the last 70 miles of its course through the District, gradually widening into an estuary, whose shores when they fall away into the Gulf of Cambay are more than 13 miles apart. The water of these rivers is not made use of for irrigation; and though each has a tidal estuary extending for several miles inland, none of them, except the Narbad\u00e1, and for a short distance the Dh\u00e1dhar, is serviceable for purposes of navigation. Owing to the height of the banks of its rivers, the District is, for drainage purposes, to a great extent dependent on creeks or backwaters running inland, either directly from the coast-line or from the banks of rivers at points in their course below the limit of tidal influence. Of the salt-water creeks or backwaters, the three most important are the Mota, breaking off from the Dh\u00e1dhar river about 6 miles west of the town of Amod; the Bh\u00fakhi, running inland from the right bank of the Narbad\u00e1, about 15 miles west of the town of Broach; and the Wand,\nan inlet from the shore of the Gulf of Cambay, about 8 miles north of the mouth of the Kim river.\n\nThe surface of the plain consists, over almost its entire area, of black cotton soil, highly fertile and well cultivated. This black soil covers deposits of brown clay, containing nodular limestone above and gravel and sand underneath. Within 30 miles of the coast hardly any rocks are to be seen. Farther inland, the gravels and clays of the nummulitic series begin to appear, and in the south of the District trap crops out. Conglomerate and limestone are also found in this tract, but otherwise the plain of Broach contains no minerals. Except for a tract of waste land 161 acres in extent, lately set apart for the growth of babul trees (Acacia), the District is without forests; and only in the few villages where the lighter varieties of soil are found is the plain well covered with trees. The Palmyra palm is the only liquor-yielding tree of the District, and it is largely found south of the Narbad\u00e1. Of the fruit-trees are the mango, guava, and tamarind. On an island in the Narbad\u00e1 (Nerbudda), about 12 miles above Broach, is a famous banian or bar (Ficus Indicus) tree, known as the Kabir bar, because, as the story goes, it sprang from a twig which the sage Kabir once used for cleaning his teeth. About the year 1780, this tree is said to have had 350 large and over 3000 small stems, the principal of which enclosed a space nearly 2000 feet in circumference; in the march of an army this tree had been known to have sheltered 7000 men. Nearly 50 years later (April 1825) Bishop Heber wrote of this tree, \u2018Though a considerable part of the tree has within the last few years been washed away, enough remains to make it one of the most noble groves in the world.\u2019 Since then it has suffered much from age and floods, and is now little more than a ruin.\n\nThe domestic animals are cows, buffaloes, oxen, camels, horses, asses, sheep, and goats. The cattle of the District are of two breeds\u2014the small indigenous bullock, and the large ox of Northern Gujar\u00e1t. The smaller breed of bullocks, which are generally driven in riding carts, are worth from \u00a36 to \u00a312 a pair; the larger sort, used for ploughing, are worth from \u00a315 to \u00a320. Well-to-do cultivators pay much attention to the appearance and condition of their cattle. Cultivation is too general to allow much scope for wild animals. The hog, wolf, and antelope almost exhaust the list. Of birds, the chief are the floriken, sand grouse, partridge, quail, duck, snipe, and crane. The District is well supplied with fish\u2014fresh-water, salt-water, and migratory.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The earliest year for which an estimate of the population is available is 1820, when the number of inhabitants was returned at 229,527, or 173 to the square mile. In 1851, the number was 290,984, or 200 to the square mile. The Census of 1872 gave a total population of 350,322 persons, or 257\u00b797 to the square mile.\nThe Census of 1881 returned a total population of 326,930, or 225 to the square mile; of these the males numbered 168,482, the females 158,448; occupying 13,588 houses in 4 towns and 58,647 houses in 401 villages. The number of unoccupied houses was returned at 19,457. Classified according to religion, there were 115,542 male and 107,296 female Hindus: total, 222,838; 34,280 male and 32,968 female Muhammadans: total, 67,248; Christians, 115; Jains, 3768; Jews, 18; P\u00e1rs\u00eds, 3042; Buddhists, 2; Brahmos, 3; and aborigines, 29,896. Under the term Hindu are included Br\u00e1hmans, who numbered 13,161; R\u00e1jputs, 16,710; Cham\u00e1rs, 3417; Darjis and Shimp\u00eds, 1964; Dhob\u00eds, 1094; Dubl\u00e1is, 18,037; Barbers, 3577; Kanb\u00eds, 27,142; Kol\u00eds, 52,500; Kumbhars, 4451; Lohan\u00e1s, 918; Loh\u00e1rs, or blacksmiths, 1690; Mal\u00eds, or gardeners, 401; Mah\u00e1r and Dhers, 15,553; Son\u00e1rs, or goldsmiths, 2181; S\u00fat\u00e1rs, or carpenters, 2320; Tel\u00eds, or oilmen, 3380. The aborigines are almost entirely Bhils. The agricultural population was returned at 190,443, or 58\u00b725 per cent. of the total, of which 128,776, or 39\u00b74 per cent., were workers.\n\nThe practice of separating into small distinct classes has in Broach been carried so far that, in a Hindu population of 222,838 persons, there are representatives of 142 distinct castes, which are again split up into numerous sub-divisions. Among Musalm\u00e1ns there are two classes distinct in origin, though now considerably mixed by intermarriage\u2014Muhammadan immigrants, and converts to Isl\u00e1m. These comprise four classes, Sayyid, Mughal, Path\u00e1n, and Shaikh, with a total population of 67,248 persons. Of the Musalm\u00e1ns whose origin is traced to Hindu converts, the most important are the Borahs (Bohar\u00e1s), who include two main classes, distinct from each other in occupation and in sect, one engaged in trade, and who are mostly Ism\u00e1\u00edl\u00ed Shi\u00e1s, the other employed almost entirely in tilling the fields, belonging to the Sunn\u00ed sect, and forming nearly half of the entire Musalm\u00e1n population of the District. For other classes of converted Hindus\u2014the Mole-sal\u00e1ms (formerly R\u00e1jputs), the M\u00e1leks, the Momn\u00e1s, and the Shekhs\u2014no separate figures are available. With the exception of the Borahs, who are a well-to-do body, the Broach Musalm\u00e1ns are for the most part in a depressed condition. Besides the above classes, there is among the orthodox Musalm\u00e1ns of Broach a peculiar community called Nagoris, who have long been settled in the District. They are said to derive their name from their former home, Nagor, a town in M\u00e1lw\u00e1; they are now carters and labourers.\n\nThe chief agricultural classes of Broach District are Kanb\u00eds, R\u00e1jputs, Kachchh\u00eds, M\u00e1l\u00eds, and Kol\u00eds; the trading classes are Vaishnava Baniy\u00e1s, as well as Sar\u00e1waks or Jains, Borahs of the Shi\u00e1 sect, and P\u00e1rs\u00eds. The cultivating Borahs are a hard-working and intelligent but somewhat turbulent body of men. In language and\nhabits they resemble the Kanbis and other Hindus, but are distinguishable by their beard as well as by a peculiar cast of countenance. While professing the faith of Isl\u00e1m, they do not intermarry with other Musalm\u00e1ns. The Kanbis, as peaceable as they are industrious, form the most respectable part of the rural population; they are well acquainted with the qualities and powers of all varieties of the soil. The R\u00e1jputs afford an instance of a complete change from the fierceness and turbulence of a martial class, to the quietness, obedience, and industry of tillers of the soil. The Kol\u00eds, who stand lower in the social scale than the Kanbis, formerly bore a bad reputation as plunderers, but they are now a reformed race. In many villages they are as steady and hard-working cultivators as any in the District. A few P\u00e1rs\u00eds are engaged in agriculture, and are said to be active and skilful husbandmen. Most of the members of this class deal in merchandize, and together with the Sar\u00e1waks form the two most wealthy sections of the trading community. The Census Report of 1881 returned the male population according to occupation under the following six main headings: (1) Professional class, including civil and military, all Government officials, and the learned professions, 8,450; (2) domestic servants, inn and lodging-house keepers, etc., 2,693; (3) commercial class, including bankers, merchants, traders, carriers, etc., 3,973; (4) agricultural and pastoral class, including gardeners, 71,420; (5) industrial class, including all manufacturers and artisans, 63,732; (6) indefinite and non-productive, including general labourers, male children, and persons of unspecified occupation, 168,482.\n\nOf the whole population, about 20 per cent. live in towns containing more than 5000 inhabitants. Originally the towns were walled, and each was provided with its own fort. Within the circuit of the walls lived the richest part of the people, dwelling in well-built houses; without were the poorer classes, lodged chiefly in hovels. Though the fortifications have now been allowed to fall into decay, a marked distinction still remains between the town proper and its suburbs. The villages have in general a thriving appearance, arising from the common use of tiles for the houses instead of thatch; and the trees with which they are surrounded contribute to give a pleasing effect. The respectable inhabitants have their houses together in courts or closes, with an entrance common to all the families who belong to the same close, which is shut at night for the protection of the cattle. Formerly many of the villages were surrounded by walls of mud or burnt brick as a shelter against the attacks of freebooters, but now only one village remains walled, and its fortifications are said to be broken down in many places. Exclusive of 14 hamlets, there were, in 1881, 405 inhabited towns and villages, giving an average of 0.29 village to each square mile, and 807.23 inhabitants to each village. Of these 405 towns and\nvillages, 14 contained less than one hundred inhabitants; 32 from one to two hundred; 161 from two to five hundred; 129 from five hundred to a thousand; 50 from one to two thousand; 11 from two to three thousand; 4 from three to five thousand; 2 from five to ten thousand; 1 from ten to fifteen thousand; and one from twenty to fifty thousand inhabitants.\n\nIn 1881, the total number of houses was 91,692, or an average of 63.10 per square mile. Of these, about one-fourth were built of stone or fire-baked brick, and roofed with tile. The remainder had outer walls of mud or sun-dried brick, and thatched roofs. A well-to-do trader's house generally contains furniture worth altogether about \u00a347. Of this amount, cots, cupboards, couches, boxes, carpets, quilts, and mattresses represent about \u00a327, and cooking pots about \u00a320. A well-to-do cultivator owns one or two strong wooden boxes, wooden bedsteads and flock coverlets, worth altogether about \u00a314, besides cooking pots worth \u00a310. An artisan in middling circumstances possesses one or two mattresses, two or three beds, cooking and drinking pots, worth altogether about \u00a32, 8s. A poor labourer has only a few earthen jars and one or two mattresses, worth about a shilling or two.\n\nTrade Guilds.\u2014The trade guilds of Broach include the leading capitalists of the city, the bankers and money-changers, cotton dealers, agents, and those engaged in the business of insurance; other unions represent the smaller trades, and are conducted on the panchayat system common throughout India. Details of the constitution and objects of these associations are given in the article on the District of Ahmadabad, where the system is more fully developed than in Broach. One of the main sources of revenue of the chief guild of Broach city is a tax of from 6d. to 1s. per bale levied by the managers on cotton. Except in the case of cotton bills, there is also a charge of \u00bed. on every bill of exchange negotiated. The receipts from these taxes are applied to Hindu objects of charity and religion. The chief institution maintained is the hospital (panjirapol) for old and sick animals, supported at a yearly cost of about \u00a3530. In addition to fees and fines levied upon members for breaches of trade rules, some of the guilds adopt special means for collecting funds. Money-changers, grain-dealers, grocers, and tobacco merchants, make the observance of their trade holidays\u2014the 2nd, the 11th, and the last day of each fortnight\u2014a source of revenue to the general body. On the occasion of these holidays, only one shop is allowed to remain open in each market. The right to open this shop is put up to auction, and the amount of the bid is kept for caste purposes. Similarly the bankers, cotton dealers, insurers, and bricklayers have, for trade purposes, imposed a tax on the members of their craft or calling. In the case of other classes, the necessary sums are collected by subscription among the members of the caste.\nVillage Officials.\u2014At the time of the introduction of British rule (1803), there was in many villages an association of members of the proprietary body, by which the amount of the State demand was distributed according to a fixed proportion among the members. The peculiarities of this joint and sharehold tenure (bh\u00e1gad\u00edri) have to some extent disappeared before the system of collecting the revenue direct from the different shareholders; but in most places the village organization still remains tolerably complete. The staff of village servants includes as a rule the head-man, p\u00e1tel; the clerk, tal\u00e1ti; the family priest, gh\u00e1mot; the potter, kumbh\u00e1r; the barber, hajj\u00e1m; the carpenter, sut\u00e1r; the blacksmith, loh\u00e1r; the tailor, darz\u00ed; the shoemaker, moch\u00ed; the washerman, \u00e1hobi; the tanner, kh\u00e1lpa; the sweeper, dher; the scavenger, bhung\u00ed; the watchman, wartania or rakha. Besides this establishment, in some villages are to be found the water-drawer, kosia; the water-supplier, parabio; goldsmith, son\u00ed or son\u00e1r; singer, b\u00e1rot or bh\u00e1t; teacher, \u00e1kh\u00edn; physician, baidya; astronomer, joshi; strolling players, bhav\u00e1y\u00e1; Hindu devotees, gos\u00e1n\u00ed or hair\u00edg\u00ed; and Musalm\u00e1n devotees, fakir. The head-men retain to the present day much of their former influence. They are in many cases rich, and possess a strong hold over the villagers by reason of their business as money-lenders.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Exclusive of lands belonging to other territory situated within its limits, Broach District contains a total area of 1453 square miles or 933,764 acres, of which 193,886 acres, or 20\u00b776 per cent., are alienated, and 243,556 acres, or 26\u00b708 per cent., are uncultivable waste, including the area of village sites, roads, rivers, reservoirs, and the tracts of salt land liable to be flooded at specially high tides. The total area of State cultivable assessed land is therefore 496,322 acres, of which 463,475, or 93\u00b738 per cent., were occupied in 1880\u201381, and 32,847, or 6\u00b762 per cent., were unoccupied or lying waste. About 2633 acres of salt land have been taken up by private individuals for reclamation. These lands have been leased by Government on special conditions, rent free for the first ten years, and for the following twenty years at rents varying from 6d. to 1s. per acre, to be subject to the usual assessment rates after thirty years. The land is for agricultural purposes divided into two main classes, light soils and black soils; the former compose about one-fourth, and the latter three-fourths of the entire area. There is also a rich alluvial deposit known as bh\u00fatil\u00e1, in which products of all kinds, especially tobacco and castor-oil plants, are raised. The holders of land belong to two classes\u2014proprietors of large estates or th\u00e1kurs, and peasant proprietors or r\u00fayats. Of the total assessed area, 47,017 acres, or 6\u00b781 per cent., are in the possession of men belonging to the landlord class, who are the heirs of old R\u00e1jput families. A peasant proprietor is either a member of a cultivating community, or an independent holder with an individual interest in the land he tills. Of the\nwhole number of villages in the District, the lands of 244, or 59.51 per cent., were in 1862 held by corporations of shareholders, and the remaining 166 villages, or 48.49 per cent., by individual cultivators. Of the whole area of the Government land, 457,806 acres, or 92.24 per cent., are held under the ordinary survey tenure for a term of thirty years, at rates subject to revision. The land alienated by the State is held at a fixed quit-rent. The assessment and quit-rent paid and payable to the State amounts to \u00a3226,629; the local cess, to \u00a317,510: total, \u00a3244,139.\n\nThere are two harvests in the year, (1) the early or kharif, and (2) the late or rabi. The early crops are sown in June, and, except cotton, which is seldom ready for picking before February, are harvested in October and November. The late crops are sown in October, and reaped in February. A field of black soil requires only one ploughing, and is seldom manured. Light soils, on the other hand, are ploughed three or four times, and are generally manured. The entire set of implements used on a farm may be valued at from \u00a31,10s. to \u00a32. The agricultural stock in the possession of the cultivators of State or khils\u00e1 villages in 1880-81 numbered 26,228 ploughs, 18,489 carts, 59,326 bullocks, 47,676 buffaloes, 13,430 cows, 770 horses, 1,182 mares, 611 foals, 20,420 sheep and goats, and 1,171 asses. Of 463,475 acres of Government land occupied in the year 1880-81, 65,026 acres, or 13.90 per cent., were fallow or under grass. Of the 399,063 acres under actual cultivation in 1880-81, grain crops occupied 185,713 acres, or 46.5 per cent.; pulses, 36,177 acres, or 9.1 per cent.; tobacco, 1,499 acres, or 0.3 per cent.; sugar-cane, 139 acres; indigo, 232 acres; oil-seeds, 10,460 acres, or 2.7 per cent.; cotton, 162,979 acres, or 40.9 per cent.; miscellaneous crops, 1,864 acres, or 0.4 per cent. Since the year 1812, attempts have been made from time to time to improve the cultivation and preparation of cotton. So far, the result has been to show that foreign varieties will not thrive in the District. In the matter of ginning considerable improvements have been made. By the introduction of the Platt Macarthy Rolley Gin in 1864, the old native hand-gin (charkha) has been entirely supplanted.\n\nThe years 1630, 1631, and 1755 are said to have been seasons of scarcity in which, owing to the failure of crops, remissions of revenue were granted. In 1760, 1761, 1773, 1786, and 1787, portions of the District verged so closely upon famine that the revenue had to be very largely remitted. The great famine of 1790 was caused by the entire failure of the ordinary rainfall. Since the beginning of the present century, six years of scarcity, amounting almost to famine, are recorded. The year 1819 was marked by excessive rainfall, and 1838, 1840, and 1868 by total or partial failure of rain. In 1812, the District suffered from the ravages of locusts, and in 1835 from frost. Years of partial\ndrought have also been numerous. In 1878, the autumnal crops failed in two of the western taluks, on account of excessive moisture due to heavy rainfall; all the fields sown after a certain period were attacked by swarms of grubs. The cotton crop in all seasons is liable to be injured by the boll-worm.\n\nCommunications and Trade.\u2014There are 13 lines of road, extending over a total distance of 147\u00bd miles, and 28 miles of railway running through the District. Till within the last fifteen years, the highway of the trade of the District, as well as of the trade of a large section of Gujarat and Western M\u00e1lw\u00e1, passed through the ports of Broach and Tank\u00e1ri down the estuaries of the Narbad\u00e1 (Nerbudda) and Dh\u00e1dh\u00e1r. Since the opening of the railway, the trade by sea has greatly fallen off. It is still, however, large enough to support a fleet of small coasting vessels, and occasionally attracts into the Narbad\u00e1 foreign ships of large size. Strictly speaking, there are no harbours along the coast line of the District. The estuaries of the rivers, navigable for 92 miles, offer shelter to coasting vessels during the stormy months of the monsoon. In 1820, there were five seaports (bandar), viz. Degam, Tank\u00e1ri, Ghandhar, Dehej, and Broach. Of these, only two, Broach and Tank\u00e1ri, are still seats of trade. During the ten years ending 1847, the total value of sea-borne imports and exports averaged \u00a31,150,091. From 1856 to 1862, the corresponding returns fell to \u00a3970,339. From 1865 to 1870, they amounted on an average to \u00a3634,369; while in 1874 they had fallen as low as \u00a3391,297, or about one-third of the corresponding returns of twenty-five years before. In 1880\u201381, the imports were \u00a3155,104; exports, \u00a3449,898: total, \u00a3605,002. In the Broach District section of 28 miles of the Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway, the chief engineering work is the bridge over the Narbad\u00e1. This structure consists of 67 spans, or a total length of 4122 feet, with a maximum height of 120 feet from screw to rail level, the screw being 60 feet below the river bed, or 72 feet below low water in mid channel. The most important branch of Broach trade is the export of cotton. To the total of 65,348 tons, valued at \u00a31,637,965, exported during the year 1874, cotton contributed \u00a31,376,508, or 84.03 per cent. In connection with this cotton trade, 31 steam presses were employed in the District in 1874.\n\nAt present the capital by which the trade of Broach is carried on is for the most part supplied from Bombay. In 1820, the Broach dealers are said to have been representatives of mercantile houses in Bombay, Surat, and Ujjain; and now, in the majority of cases, they are agents of Bombay firms. Except in the town of Broach, where there are a few P\u00e1rsis and Borahs, the capitalists are almost all Baniy\u00e1s by caste. Carriers and other unskilled town labourers earn from 6d. to 9\u00bdd. a day; agricultural labourers, from 3d. to 4\u00bdd.; bricklayers and carpenters,\nfrom 1s. 3d. to 1s. 6d. Female labourers are paid about one-third less than males. Lads of from 12 to 15 get about two-thirds less; boys of from 10 to 13, who accompany carpenters and bricklayers, are paid about one-fifth of the ordinary rate. The current prices per maund of 40 sers or 80 lbs. of the chief articles of food during 1881 were, for wheat, 6s.; for rice, 9s. 2\u00bdd.; for Indian millet or jowar (Sorghum vulgare), 4s. 3\u00bdd.; for Italian millet or bajra (Holcus spicatus), 4s. 8\u00bdd.; for gram, 5s. 3d.; for peas or dal, 4s. 9\u00bdd.; for barley, 6s. 3d.\n\nHistory.\u2014Though the English established a Factory at Broach for trade purposes as early as 1616, it was not until after their capture of the castle of Surat in 1759 that they had any political relations with the native ruler. But soon after their accession to political power at Surat, certain questions of revenue gave rise to a dispute with the ruler of Broach, and in 1771 a force was sent from Surat against his capital. This expedition, which was not begun till May, resulted in failure; but during the ensuing rainy season, the Naw\u00e1b of Broach visited Bombay, and agreed to pay to the English a sum of \u00a340,000. This, however, he failed to do, and in November 1772 a second expedition was sent against Broach. The city was taken with little difficulty, though with the loss of General Wedderburn, the commander of the force. The territory acquired by the capture of the city comprised 162 villages. In 1783, the country under Broach, which by treaty and conquest had by that time come to include the lands of Ankleswar, H\u00e1nsoot, Dehejb\u00e1ra, and Amod, was by the treaty of S\u00e1lb\u00e1i (Salbye) handed over to the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s\u2014the original conquest to Mah\u00e1d\u00e1j\u00ed Sindhi\u00e1, and the new acquisitions to the Peshw\u00e1. For nineteen years these territories remained under Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 rule, till in 1803, in consequence of the treaty of Bassein, Sindhi\u00e1\u2019s possessions in Gujar\u00e1t were invaded by a British force, and the city of Broach was again taken. No further territorial changes took place till 1818, when, under the terms of the treaty of Poona, three sub-divisions were added to the District. Since that date the history of Broach has been marked by only two events\u2014in 1823, an outbreak of Kol\u00eds took place, and in 1857 a riot between the P\u00e1rs\u00eds and Musalm\u00e1ns. The first revenue settlement of the District took place in 1870\u201371; it will become open to resettlement in 1895\u201396.\n\nAdministration.\u2014For administrative purposes, the District is divided into 5 t\u00e1lukas or Sub-divisions, viz. Amod, Broach, Ankleswar, Jambusar, and Wagr\u00e1. The administration in revenue matters is entrusted to a Collector and three Assistants, of whom one is a covenanted civil servant. For judicial purposes, the District was formerly included within the jurisdiction of the Judge of Surat. It now contains 4 civil judges and 15 stipendiary magistrates, the average distance in miles of villages from the nearest court being 12. In the year 1880\u201381,\nthe total strength of the regular police force was 417 officers and men. Of these, under the District superintendent, 2 were subordinate officers, 77 inferior subordinate officers, 22 mounted constables, and 315 foot-constables, of whom 180 were provided with firearms, and the remainder with swords or batons. The cost of maintaining this force was \u00a37683. These figures show 1 man to every 3'49 square miles, as compared with the area, and 1 man to every 784 persons, as compared with the population; the cost of maintenance being equal to \u00a35, 9s. per square mile, or 5\u00bdd. per head of population. With the exception of accommodation provided for a few under-trial prisoners at the head-quarters of each Sub-division, there is no prison in the District. All prisoners are now conveyed by rail to the District jail in Surat. The District contains 9 post-offices and 6 telegraph offices, one at each of the 5 stations on the railway, and a separate Government office at Broach.\n\nThe District local funds, created since 1863 for works of public utility and rural education, yielded in 1880-81 a total of \u00a318,552. There are one city and two town municipalities at Broach, Jamb\u00fasar, and Ankleswar. The total municipal receipts in 1880-81 amounted to \u00a39922; and the expenditure to \u00a310,504, the incidence of taxation being 3s. 1\u00bdd. per head of population within municipal limits, 4s. 1\u00bdd. per head in Broach, and 1s. 0\u00bdd. in Jamb\u00fasar. The whole amount of revenue raised in 1880-81\u2014imperial, municipal, and local\u2014was \u00a3261,574, or 16s. per head of the entire population. Of this, \u00a3224,278 was derived from the land revenue; \u00a39649 from excise, and \u00a315,285 from the sale of stamps.\n\nIn the year 1880-81, there were 3 superior schools, with an attendance of 377 pupils, and 214 Government primary schools, or 1 school for every 2 inhabited villages, with an average attendance of 11,347 pupils, or 3'5 per cent. of the total population. Of the total number, 7 were girls' schools. The whole cost of education to the State amounted to \u00a36890. In Broach city there is 1 library and 2 local newspapers.\n\nThere are in all 15 fairs or places of pilgrimage, of which 11 are reported to by Hindus, and 4 by Musalm\u00e1ns. Shukaltirth is annually visited by about 25,000 pilgrims. At Bh\u00e1dbhut and Karod, the number varies from 50,000 to 100,000. The chief towns are\u2014(1) BROACH, with a population (1881) of 37,281; (2) JAMBUSAR, population 11,479; (3) ANKLESWAR, population 9535; (4) AMOD, population 5822.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The District is as healthy as any part of Gujar\u00e1t, and the climate is much more pleasant than in those parts of the Province situated farther from the sea. For a series of years ending with 1849, the average rainfall was about 33 inches; between 1852 and 1860, the average returns are 41'60 inches; from 1860 to 1870, 34 inches; 36'27 inches in 1872-73, and 35'78 in 1873-74. According to the Meteorological Report for 1881, the general average rainfall at Broach\ncity is returned at 38\u00b087 inches. Frosts are said to occur at intervals of from 10 to 12 years, sometimes, as in 1835, sufficiently severe to destroy the crops. The latter days of March and the month of April are the hottest season in the year. At the end of April, west and south-west winds begin to blow, and continue till October, when the rainy season closes. In the following months, slight easterly winds prevail, lasting till the end of December. There are 6 dispensaries, all established within the last few years, and one hospital at Broach city. During the year 1880-81, 25,751 persons in all were treated in the dispensaries, of whom 25,612 were out-door and 139 in-door patients; while the civil hospital afforded relief to 330 in-patients and 7560 out-patients; and in the same year 6025 persons were vaccinated. The total number of deaths registered throughout the District in the fourteen years ending 1879 was 96,570, giving an average annual mortality of 6898, or a death-rate of 19\u00b716 per thousand. In 1880, the total number of deaths was returned at 10,326, or a death-rate of 31\u00b75 per thousand. During the same year the number of births was returned at 5861, of whom 3104 were males, and 2757 females, giving a birth-rate of 16\u00b773 per thousand of population.

Area (1881) 302 square miles; 1 town and 104 villages; occupied houses, 23,011. Population (1881) 110,561, or 366 per square mile. Hindus numbered 64,382; Muhammadans, 39,531; and 'others,' 15,648. Almost the whole of this Sub-division is a flat rich plain of black soil, stretching towards the north bank of the Narbad\u00e1, forty-three miles of whose course lie within its limits. The remainder consists of a few islands in the bed of the river, and a narrow strip of land on the southern bank, nearly opposite the city of Broach. The supply of tank and well water is defective. Of the total area of the Sub-division, 14 square miles are occupied by the lands of alienated villages. The remainder, according to the revenue survey returns, comprises 125,321 acres of occupied land; 10,406 acres of cultivable waste; 29,593 acres of uncultivable waste, and 20,182 acres occupied by village sites, roads, tanks, and rivers. From the total Government area of 135,727 acres, 19,974 acres have to be subtracted on account of alienated lands in State villages. Of the balance of 115,753 acres, the actual area of cultivable State lands, 106,531 acres were under cultivation, fallow, or under grass in 1873-74. The Government assessment, which was fixed in 1870-71, and remains\nin force till 1899-1903, amounts to \u00a358,894 net, or an average of 10s. 5\u00bdd. per acre. The Sub-division contained 3 civil and 6 criminal courts in 1883, with two police stations (th\u00e1n\u00e1s); strength of regular police, 207 men; village watchmen (chaukid\u00e1rs), 709.\n\nBroach.\u2014Chief town of the District of the same name in Guj\u00e1r\u00e1t (Guzerat), Bombay Presidency; situated on the right bank of the Narbad\u00e1 (Nerbudda) river, about 30 miles from its mouth. Lat. 21\u00b0 43' N., long. 73\u00b0 2' E.; area, including suburbs, 3\u00bd square miles; number of houses, 10,443; population (1881) 37,281, namely, males 19,404, and females 17,877, classified as follows:\u2014Hindus, 22,201; Musalm\u00e1ns, 10,847; Jains, 873; P\u00e1rs\u00eds, 2088; Christians, 111; and 'others,' 1161; municipal revenue (1881) \u00a37985, or 1s. 3\u00bdd. per head of population; municipal expenditure in same year, \u00a39256.\n\nSeen from the southern bank of the Narbad\u00e1, or approached by the railway bridge from the south, the massive stone wall, rising from the water's edge, and lining the river bank for about a mile, and the buildings standing out from the high ground behind, give the town of Broach a marked and picturesque appearance. The fortifications, though by local tradition ascribed to Sidh R\u00e1j Jaisingj\u00ed of Anhilw\u00e1ra (12th century), were, according to the author of the Mirat-i-Stkandri, built in 1526 A.D., under the orders of Sult\u00e1n Bah\u00e1dur, King of Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d. In the middle of the 17th century (1660), the walls are said to have been destroyed by the Emperor Aurangzeb, and about twenty-five years later, to have been rebuilt by the same monarch as a protection against the attacks of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. Of late years, the fortifications on the land side have been allowed to fall into disrepair, and in some places almost every trace of them has disappeared. On the southern side, where protection is required against the floods of the river, the city wall is kept in good order. Built of large blocks of stone, the river face of the wall, raised from 30 to 40 feet high, stretches along the bank for about a mile. It is provided with five gates, and the top forms a broad pathway. The circuit of the wall includes an area of 3\u00bdths of a square mile, which in the centre rises to a height of from 60 to 80 feet above the surrounding country. This mound, from the broken bricks and other d\u00e9bris dug out of it, shows signs of being in part at least of artificial construction. At the same time, the presence of one or two small hillocks to the north of the city favours the opinion that it may have been the rising ground on the river bank which led the early settlers to choose Broach as the site for a city. Within the walls, the streets are narrow, and in some places steep. The houses are generally two storeys high, with walls of brick and tiled roofs. In the eastern part of the town are some large family mansions said to have been built in 1790. In the suburbs the houses have a meaner appearance, many of them being not more than one storey high, with walls of wattle and daub.\nThe city of Broach was, according to local legend, originally founded by the sage Bhragu, and called Bhragupur or Bhragu's city. In the 1st century of the Christian era, the sage's settlement had given its name\u2014Barugaza\u2014to a large Province, and had itself become one of the chief ports in Western India. Two hundred years later, it was the capital of a R\u00e1jput king; and in the early part of the 7th century, it is said by the Chinese pilgrim, Hwen Thsang, to have contained 10 Buddhist convents, with 300 monks and 10 temples. Half a century later, Broach was a town of sufficient importance to attract some of the earliest Musalm\u00e1n expeditions against Western India. Under the R\u00e1jput dynasties of Anhilw\u00e1ra (746-1300 A.D.), Broach was a flourishing seaport. During the troubles that followed the overthrow of the Anhilw\u00e1ra kings, the city would seem to have changed hands on more than one occasion. But with the exception of two years (1534-36), during which it was held by the officers of the Emperor Hum\u00e1y\u00fan, Broach remained (1391 to 1572) under the Musalm\u00e1n dynasty of Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d. About this time, the city was twice (1536 and 1546) plundered by the Portuguese, who, except for its streets, 'so narrow most of them that two horsemen could not pass at the same time,' admired the city 'with its magnificent and lofty houses, with their costly lattices, the famous ivory and blackwood workshops, and its townsmen well skilled in mechanics\u2014chiefly weavers, who make the finest cloth in the world' (Decadas de Couto, v. 325). In 1573, Broach was surrendered to the Emperor Akbar by Muzaffar Sh\u00e1h III., the last of the line of Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d kings. Ten years later, Muzaffar Sh\u00e1h recovered the city, but held it only for a few months, when it again fell into the hands of the Emperor of Delhi. In 1616 a British factory, and in 1617 a Dutch factory, were established at Broach. In 1660, some of the fortifications of the city were razed to the ground by the order of the Emperor Aurangzeb. In this defenceless state it was twice, in 1675 and 1686, plundered by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. After the second attack, Aurangzeb ordered that the walls should be rebuilt, and the city named Sukh\u00e1b\u00e1d. In 1736, the Musalm\u00e1n commandant of the port was raised by Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk to the rank of Naw\u00e1b. In April 1771, an attempt on the part of the English to take Broach failed; but in November 1772 a second force was sent against the town, and this time it was stormed and captured. In 1783, it was handed over to Sindhi\u00e1, but was retaken in 1803 by the British, and since that time it has remained in our possession.\n\nIn 1777, the town is said to have contained 50,000 inhabitants; in 1812, 37,716. The census of 1872 returned 36,932; that of 1881, 37,281. The only classes calling for special notice are, among Hindus, the Bhr\u00e1gav Br\u00e1hmans, who claim to be descendants of the sage Bhragu. The P\u00e1rs\u00eds, from the number and antiquity of their Towers of Silence, are supposed\nto have settled at Broach as far back as the 11th century. Formerly shipbuilders and skilled weavers, they have suffered from the decay of both trades. Many of them have migrated to Bombay, to improve their circumstances; and the frugality of those that are left enables them to keep out of pauperism. The Brahma Kshattris\u2014a writer caste\u2014are influential and prosperous. The greater number and most wealthy of the trading classes are Sr\u00e1waks or Jains. The Musalm\u00e1ns are for the most part in a condition of poverty.\n\nBroach is one of the oldest seaports in Western India. Eighteen hundred years ago, it was a chief seat of the trade then carried on between India and the ports of Western Asia. In more recent times, though the trade of Gujar\u00e1t has never again centred in the harbours of this District, Broach so far maintained its position, that in the 17th century it sent ships eastward to Java and Sumatra, and westward to Aden and the ports of the Red Sea. Later on, the foreign trade of Gujar\u00e1t collected more and more in Surat, until from Surat it was transferred to Bombay. The cotton once exported from Broach to China and Bengal, was sent through Surat and Bombay; and as far back as 1815, the Broach ports ceased to have any foreign commerce. They now possess only a coasting trade south to Bombay and all the intermediate ports, and north as far as M\u00e1ndvi, in Cutch. The total value of the sea-borne trade of Broach in 1880\u201381 was \u00a3601,467, of which \u00a3154,026 represented the value of imports, and \u00a3447,441 that of exports. The chief articles of trade are, towards the south, exports\u2014flowers of the mahu\u00e1 tree (Bassia latifolia), wheat, and cotton; imports\u2014molasses, rice, betel-nut, timber, coal, iron, and cocoa-nut. To the west and north the exports are\u2014grain, cotton seed, mahu\u00e1 flowers, tiles, and firewood; the imports, chiefly stone for building.\n\nIn ancient times, cloth is mentioned as one of the chief articles of export from Broach; and in the 17th century, when the English and Dutch first settled in Gujar\u00e1t, it was the fame of its cloth manufactures that led them to establish factories in Broach. The kinds of cloth for which Broach was specially known at that time would seem to have been b\u00e1st\u00e1s, broad and narrow dimities, and other fine calicoes. The gain to the European trader of having a factory at Broach was, that he might \u2018oversee the weavers, buying up the cotton yarn to employ them all the rains, when he sets on foot his investments, that they may be ready against the season for the ships.\u2019 About the middle of the 17th century, the District is said to have produced more manufactures, and those of the finest fabrics, than the same extent of country in any other part of the world, not excepting Bengal. In spite of the increasing competition of the produce of steam factories in Bombay, Surat, and Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d, handloom weaving in Broach has within the last few years shown signs of reviving.\nWith the exception of a stone mosque constructed out of an older Hindu temple, the city contains no buildings of interest. To the west are the groves of the well-wooded suburbs of Vajalpur, and northwards a group of two hills relieves the line of the level plain, while on the north-east rows of tamarind trees mark where a hundred years ago was the Naw\u00e1b's garden, with 'summer pavilions, fountains, and canals.' To the east are the spots that, to a Hindu, give the town a special interest, the site of King B\u00e1lf's sacrifice, and the temple of Bhragu Rishi. About 200 yards from the bastion at the north-west corner of the fort is the tomb of Brigadier David Wedderburn, who was killed at the siege of Broach on 14th November 1772. About two miles west of the fort, are a few large and massive tombs, raised to members of the Dutch Factory. Beyond the Dutch tombs are the five P\u00e1rs\u00ed Towers of Silence: four being old and disused, and the fifth lately built by a rich P\u00e1rs\u00ed merchant of Bombay. The city has been surveyed with a view to protect the rights of both the Government and the public. The drinking water used by the inhabitants of the intramural parts of the town comes almost entirely from the Narbad\u00e1. There are but few wells in the city; and, unlike Surat and Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d, the custom of having cisterns in dwelling-houses for the storage of rain water is not general.\n\n**B\u00fabak.**\u2014Town and railway station in Sehw\u00e1n tiluk, Kar\u00e1chi (Kurrachee) District, Sind, Bombay Presidency; 9 miles west of the town of Sehw\u00e1n. Lat. 26\u00b0 26' 30\" N., long. 67\u00b0 45' 15\" E. Population (1881) 2836. Municipal revenue in 1880-81, \u00a3305; incidence of taxation about 2s. 1\u00bdd. per head; expenditure, \u00a3246. Post-office, school, and police station. Carpets of good quality are manufactured. Owing to floods caused by the overflow of the Manchhar Lake, the zam\u00ednd\u00e1rs have been of late years considerably impoverished. To resist these encroachments, the town has been surrounded by a ditch. The public health has been affected in consequence, and in 1869 B\u00fabak suffered severely from cholera. The railway station is distant 3 miles from the town.\n\n**B\u00fad-B\u00fad.**\u2014Village and police station in Bardw\u00e1n District, Bengal. Lat. 23\u00b0 24' 30\" N., long. 87\u00b0 34' 45\" E.\n\n**Bud\u00e1un (Bud\u00e1on).**\u2014British District in the Lieutenant-Governorship of the North-Western Provinces, lying between 27\u00b0 39' and 28\u00b0 27' N. lat., and between 78\u00b0 19' 15\" and 79\u00b0 41' E. long.; area, 2001\u00b78 square miles; population in 1881, 906,451 souls. Bud\u00e1un forms the south-western District of the Rohilkhand Division. It is bounded on the north-east by Bareli (Bareilly) and the State of R\u00e1mpur, on the north-west by Morad\u00e1b\u00e1d, on the south-west by the Ganges, and on the east by Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur. The administrative head-quarters are at the town of Bud\u00e1un.\n\n**Physical Aspects.**\u2014The District of Bud\u00e1un does not materially differ\nin its main features from the other portions of the great Gangetic plain. It stretches, with little diversity of surface or scenery, from the valley of the R\u00e1mgang\u00e1 on the east, to the sacred river which forms its boundary on the west, in an almost unbroken succession of ancient alluvial uplands. But although its level face is seldom interrupted by any elevation greater than a shifting sandhill, yet a closer view discloses minor varieties of soil and productions which at first sight escape the eye in surveying its somewhat monotonous flats. The District is divided into two nearly equal portions by the river Sot, on whose banks the town of Bud\u00e1un occupies a picturesque eminence, crowned by mouldering battlements of early architecture. The north-eastern of these two regions forms the dividing range between the Sot and the R\u00e1mgang\u00e1, and the soil as it approaches the former stream falls away into huge gaping ravines, through which the surface drainage cuts itself an ever-widening course into the channel below. A large part of this tract still abounds in heavy jungles of dh\u00e1k and wild date, the remnant of that famous forest which once surrounded Aonl\u00e1 in Bareilly District, and into which the armies of the Mughal Emperors dared not penetrate. The estates situated in the heart of this wild region bear the name of the Bankati villages. Similar patches of dense brushwood may be found scattered here and there in other parts of the District.\n\nSouth-west of the Sot lies the central upland tract, a highly cultivated plain, comprising the richest agricultural land in Bud\u00e1un. The jungle is, however, rapidly decreasing in area, owing to the demand for firewood created by the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway. The District is, however, well wooded with timber and fruit trees, and there are few villages without a plantation of some sort. Mango groves occupy 23,945 acres, and are often planted in avenues along roadsides for the sake of the shade they afford. Beyond it, towards the Ganges, rises the high and sandy ridge known as the bh\u00far, which runs parallel to the river from end to end of the District. It consists for the most part of very barren and almost uncultivated land, interspersed at wide distances with villages of Ahars, whose cattle graze upon the short grass which covers its sandy soil. The lower alluvial basin of the Ganges lies to the south of the bh\u00far; but the fear of inundation prevents cultivators from settling on its uncertain lowlands, and vast savannahs of rank grass and tall t\u00e1t\u00edar reeds accordingly usurp the place of tillage. The principal rivers besides the Ganges, the Sot, and the R\u00e1mgang\u00e1, in order from east to west, are the Aril, the Andheri, a tributary of the Aril, the Mah\u00e1wa, with its tributaries the Chhoiya and the Nakta Nad\u00ed. The Ganges is navigable throughout the year for boats of large burthen; the R\u00e1mgang\u00e1 only in the rainy season, except for small country craft. Several shallow lakes (jhil) lie scattered throughout the District, the chief of which, the Daleganj jhil,\nhas a length of about 3 miles. The reeds and grasses which grow on the surface of these lakes and marshes, are cut by the villages for cattle fodder or for thatching purposes. A low belt of porous and somewhat marshy clay, intervening between the bh\u00fbr and the valley of the Mah\u00e2wa, probably marks the ancient bed of the Ganges. Kankar, or nodular limestone, used for road metalling, is quarried at several places in the District. The only other mineral product is a kind of calcareous marl, which is burned into lime. Among the wild animals, antelope, hog, and nilg\u00e2di are common, and wolves are found on the sandy wastes of the bh\u00fbr tract. Black partridge, quail, water-fowl, and hares abound, while floriken and sand-grouse are occasionally met with. Many varieties of fish are caught in the rivers and streams.\n\nHistory.\u2014Bud\u00e1un owes its name, as the accepted tradition records, to one Budh, an Ahar prince, who founded the city about the year 905 A.D. His descendants held the surrounding tract for another century, and Ahars still form the principal element of the population throughout all the wilder portions of the District. In 1028, Sayyid Sal\u00e2r Mas\u00e2\u00fad Gh\u00e2z\u00ee, nephew of Sult\u00e2n Mahm\u00fbd of Ghazn\u00ee, invaded the country now known as Rohilkhand, and established himself for a time in Bud\u00e1un. He suffered many losses, however, during his struggle with its Hindu possessors, and eventually abandoned his conquest, leaving many of his followers behind. In 1196, Kutab-ud-din Aibak, Ghiy\u00e1s-ud-din's viceroy in India, captured the fort of Bud\u00e1un, killed the R\u00e2j\u00e2, and sacked the city. Shams-ud-din Altamsh obtained the government of the new dependency, which he exchanged in 1210 for the throne of Delhi. Under his successors, Bud\u00e1un ranked as a place of great importance; and in 1236 gave a second Emperor to Delhi, in the person of Rukn-ud-d\u00edn, whose handsome mosque, the Jam\u00e1 Masjid Shamshi, still adorns the city in which he had been governor. During the 13th and 14th centuries, the annals of Bud\u00e1un are confined to the usual local insurrections and bloody repressions, which form the staple of Indian history before the advent of the Mughals. In 1415, Mah\u00e2bat Kh\u00e1n, the governor, rose in rebellion, and the Emperor Khizr Kh\u00e1n marched against him in vain. After a reign of eleven years' duration, the rebellious vassal was compelled in 1426 to surrender to Mub\u00e2rak Sh\u00e2h, Khizr Kh\u00e1n's successor. Alam Sh\u00e2h visited the city in 1449; and during his stay, his Waz\u00eer joined with Bahlol Lodi in depriving him of all his dominions except Bud\u00e1un, which he was permitted to retain until his death in 1479. His son-in-law, Hus\u00e1in Sh\u00e2h of Jaunpur, then took possession of the District; but Bahlol Lodi soon compelled the intruder to restore it to the Delhi Empire. After the establishment of the Mughal power, Hum\u00e2y\u00fbn appointed governors of Sambhal and Bud\u00e1un; but they disagreed, and the Sambhal governor, having taken Bud\u00e1un by siege, put his rival to death. Under the administrative\norganization of Akbar, Bud\u00e1un was formed in 1556 into a Sark\u00e1r of Subah Delhi, which was granted as a fief to K\u00e1sim Al\u00ed Kh\u00e1n. In 1571, a great fire consumed the larger part of the city; and in Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n\u2019s time the seat of Government was removed to Bareilly (Bareli). The rise of the Rohill\u00e1 power, which centred in the latter town, accelerated the decline of Bud\u00e1un. In 1719, during the reign of Muhammad Sh\u00e1h, Muhammad Kh\u00e1n Bangash annexed the southeastern portion of the District, including the city, to Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d, while the Rohill\u00e1s under Ali Muhammad seized upon the remainder. In 1754, however, the Rohill\u00e1s recovered the pargan\u00e1s which had been united to Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d. Their subsequent history, and their subjugation by the Waz\u00edr of Oudh, belong more properly to the account of Bareilly (Bareli) District. D\u00fandi Kh\u00e1n of Bud\u00e1un made his peace with Shuj\u00e1-ud-daul\u00e1 before the defeat of H\u00e1fiz Rahmat Kh\u00e1n, the national leader, at Mir\u00e1npur Katra in 1774; but after that event the Waz\u00edr attacked him, notwithstanding his submission, and took possession of Bud\u00e1un.\n\nIn 1801, the District passed with the rest of Rohilkhand under British rule. Originally, it formed part of Morad\u00e1b\u00e1d District; but in 1805, four of its pargan\u00e1s were transferred to Bareilly, namely, Ujh\u00e1n\u00ed, Us\u00e1h\u00e1t, Bud\u00e1un, and Kot Salb\u00e1han. In 1823, a District of Sahasw\u00e1n was erected into a separate charge, comprising portions of Morad\u00e1b\u00e1d, Bareilly, and Aligarh. Fifteen years later, the head-quarters were transferred to Bud\u00e1un, a larger and more important post than Sahasw\u00e1n. In 1845, the Aligarh pargan\u00e1s lying beyond the Ganges were handed over to the Do\u00e1b District of Etah, to which they more naturally belong. Since that period no territorial changes have taken place. The Mutiny of 1857 alone breaks in upon the peaceful course of civil administration. News of the outbreak at Meerut reached Bud\u00e1un on 15th May. A fortnight later, the treasure guard mutinied, plundered the treasury, and broke open the jail. The civil officers then found themselves compelled to leave for Fatehgarh. On the 2nd of June, the Bareilly mutineers marched in, and on the 17th, Abdul R\u00e1h\u00edm Kh\u00e1n assumed the government of the District. As usual, disturbances broke out between the Hindus and the Musalm\u00e1n leaders; and in July and August, the Muhammadans fought two regular battles with the Th\u00e1kurs, whom they completely defeated. At the end of August several European fugitives crossed the Ganges into the District, and were protected at D\u00e1taganj by the landholders. After the fall of Walid\u00e1d Kh\u00e1n\u2019s fort at M\u00e1l\u00e1g\u00e1rh, that rebel chieftain passed into Bud\u00e1un in October, but found it advisable to proceed to Fatehgarh. On the 5th of November, the Musalm\u00e1ns defeated the Ahars at Gunaur, and took possession of that tahsil, hitherto held by our police. Towards the close of January 1858, the rebels, under Ni\u00e1z Muhammad, marched against Fatehgarh,\nbut were met by Sir Hope Grant's force at Shams\u00e1b\u00e1d and utterly dispersed. Ni\u00e1z Mu\u1e25ammad then returned to Bud\u00e1un. On the 27th of April, General Penny's force defeated the rebels at Kakrala, but the General himself was killed in the action; while Major Gordon fell upon them in the north, near Bisauli. Their leaders fled to Bareilly, and managers were at once appointed to the various pargan\u00e1s on behalf of the British Government. By the 12th of May, Bud\u00e1un came once more into our hands, though T\u00e1ntia Topi with his fugitive army afterwards crossed this portion of Rohilkhand into Oudh, on the 27th. Brigadier Coke's column entered the District on the 3rd of June, and Colonel Wilkinson's column from Bareilly on the 8th. Order was then permanently restored, and has not since been menaced.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The Census of 1881 showed a slight decrease as compared with the previous enumeration in 1872. In 1872, the population was returned at 934,670; and in 1881 (the area being the same) at 906,451, showing a decrease of 28,219, or 3.11 per cent. in the 9 years. The Census of 1881 was taken over an area of 2001 square miles; it disclosed a total population of 906,451 persons, distributed among 1834 villages or townships, and inhabiting 102,902 houses. From these data the following averages may be deduced:\u2014Persons per square mile, 452.8; villages per square mile, 0.91; houses per square mile, 51.4; persons per village, 489; persons per house, 8.8. Classified according to sex, there were\u2014males, 487,351; females, 419,100; proportion of males, 53.78 per cent. As regards religious distinctions, the Hindus numbered 767,255, or 84.6 per cent.; while the Musalm\u00e1ns amounted to only 138,687, or 15.3 per cent. The proportion of Muhammadans is smaller in Bud\u00e1un than in any other District of Rohilkhand, except Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur. The Census also returned 160 persons Jains, 40 Sikhs, and 309 Christians or 'others.' Among the various Hindu castes, Br\u00e1hmans numbered 60,863; R\u00e1jputs, 63,562; Baniy\u00e1s, or trading class, 32,480; Ahars, graziers on the bh\u00far tract, the predominant caste in the District, 133,085; Cham\u00e1rs, landless agriculturists, who have emerged under British rule from the position of serfs, 122,085; Gadarias, or shepherd caste, 27,811; Kachhis, cultivators, 107,230; Kah\u00e1rs, labourers and palanquin-bearers, 37,146; K\u00e1yasths, 9778; and Kurmis, 6274. The Musalm\u00e1n population comprised 66,024 Sunnis, 370 Shi\u00e1s, 7 Wah\u00e1b\u00eds, and 107 of unspecified denominations. The total agricultural population of all ages and both sexes amounted to 672,773. As regards the occupations of the people, the Census report classifies the male population into the following six main divisions:\u2014(1) Professional class, including Government officials and the learned professions, 5272; (2) domestic servants, hotel and lodging-house keepers, etc., 1426; (3) commercial class, including merchants, traders, carriers, etc., 6079; (4) agricultural and pastoral\nclass, including gardeners, 248,543; (5) manufacturing, artisan, and other industrial classes, 44,500; (6) indefinite and non-productive (comprising 23,735 labourers and 157,796 unspecified, including male children), 181,531. Three predatory races infest the District\u2014the Bhantus, a Hindu tribe who wander about in large gangs of from 20 to 50 persons, and live entirely by begging and stealing; the Hab\u00farah, also Hindus, who form smaller bands, and occasionally undertake field work; and the Sansias, a vagrant Musalm\u00e1n clan who cross over from the Do\u00e1b, and bear a bad reputation for kidnapping children. Seven towns contain a population exceeding 5000 souls\u2014namely, Budaun, 33,680; Sahaswan, 14,605; Ujhani, 7185; Islamnagar, 5890; Alapur, 5630; Bilsi, 6301; and Kakra, 5810. Bisauli, which had less than 5000 inhabitants at the date of the Census, is also a considerable town, with many fine Path\u00e1n buildings, including a handsome mosque. Of the 1834 towns and villages comprising the District, 543 contain less than two hundred inhabitants; 741 have from two to five hundred; 381 from five hundred to a thousand; 133 from one to two thousand; 19 from two to three thousand; 10 from three to five thousand; 5 from five to ten thousand; 1 from ten to fifteen thousand; and 1 from twenty to fifty thousand inhabitants.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014The District contains 2001 square miles, of which 1370 are cultivated, 381 are cultivable, and 250 are uncultivable. The fertile upland of Budaun consists of a light loam, merging gradually into the poor and almost barren sand of the bh\u00far region; but the District also comprises considerable fringes of lowland, known as kh\u00e1dir and tar\u00e1i. The kh\u00e1dir is composed of porous clay, capable of producing two crops a year for many seasons in succession; it occupies the deserted channel of the Ganges, where water may always be found at a few feet below the surface. It is specially adapted for rice, which is always grown for the autumn harvest; while barley and wheat follow immediately as spring crops. The tar\u00e1i comprises the modern alluvial fringe along the present beds of the Ganges and the R\u00e1mgang\u00e1. The valley of the former river contains several large patches of \u00fasar land, whitened by the destructive saline efflorescence known as reh, which appears upon the surface after inundations or heavy rain. The mode of tillage does not differ from that of other North-Western Districts. The khar\u00edf or autumn crops include cotton, indigo, sugar-cane, rice, jod\u00edr, b\u00e1jr\u00e1, and moth; the rabi or spring crops consist chiefly of wheat, barley, oats, peas, and other cereals or pulses. There is no canal irrigation in the District, the fields being watered either from wells, lakes, ponds, swamps, or rivers; about 24 per cent. of the entire cultivated area is irrigated in this manner. Manure is not employed for the ordinary agricultural staples, but is copiously applied to the lands immediately around the villages, which produce poppy, tobacco, vege-\ntables, and other choice crops. The ordinary modes of personal and communal tenure exist in Bud\u00e1un, divisible into the three chief heads of zamind\u00e1ri, pattid\u00e1ri, and bh\u00e1yach\u00e1ri. The R\u00e1jputs are the great landowning caste, and they hold in all 622 estates. The Shaikh Musalm\u00e1ns rank next with 346 estates, and the Ahars third with 194.\n\nWhere many small proprietors exist, the owner often cultivates the whole, or nearly the whole, of his land; but, as a rule, the greater portion is leased to cultivating tenants. Out of the total cultivated area of 891,189 acres, 139,106 acres are held by the proprietors as sir or homestead; while 561,212 acres are tilled by tenants with rights of occupancy, and 190,871 acres by tenants-at-will. The average area cultivated in 1881 by each head of the agricultural population (672,773, or 74'22 per cent. of the District population) was 1'72 acres; the amount of Government land revenue and cesses levied from the landholders was \u00a3122,944; and the amount of rental, including cesses paid by the cultivators, was \u00a3236,540, or an average of 5s. 2\u00bdd. for each cultivated acre. Besides the rent, however, the income of the landlord receives considerable additions from the customary dues or cesses which tenants present upon certain stated occasions. Each agricultural tenant must supply a measure of bran in the spring, and a bundle of fodder in the autumn; he must plough his landlord's fields twice a year, at the festivals of Holi and Dasah\u00e1ra, and must lend his cart to carry home the harvest. In like manner, the oilman must offer a jar of oil, the tanner a pair of shoes, and the potter 50 earthen vessels a year; while the tailor is similarly bound to make four suits of clothes for his landlord, who supplies the cloth, but pays nothing for the labour. These dues give the proprietor great social consequence as the chief personage in his own village; and the tenants in return expect from him many favours, which would not be shown if they were remiss in discharging their customary obligations. The situation of Bud\u00e1un, lying apart from the busy channels of trade, has produced a less rapid rise in prices and wages than has occurred in many neighbouring Districts. The construction of the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway, however, has greatly added to the facilities for distributing the local produce, and rents and prices have both felt the influence of this important change. Coolies and unskilled labourers receive from 2\u00bcd. to 3\u00bed. per diem; agricultural labourers, 2\u00bcd. to 3d. per diem; and bricklayers or carpenters, 6d. to 1s. per diem. The prices current of food-stuffs ruled as follows in 1880: Wheat, 15 sers per rupee, or 7s. 6d. per cwt.; rice (best), 6 sers per rupee, or 18s. 8d. per cwt.; rice (common), 14\u00be sers per rupee, or 7s. 8d. per cwt.; jowar, 21 sers per rupee, or 5s. 4d. per cwt.; b\u00e1jr\u00fa, 18\u00be sers per rupee, or 6s. 1d. per cwt.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014Floods on the Ganges and Mah\u00e1wa occur to a greater or less extent every year; and when they rise unusually high or\nlate, much of the autumn crop is carried away. The loss, however, is not considerable, as the banks of these rivers are lined with jungle, and only occasionally cultivated by speculative proprietors. But Bud\u00e1un suffers greatly from drought, the common scourge of all Upper India. The first recorded famine occurred in the year 1761, when many of the people died, and large numbers emigrated. The next severe scarcity took place in 1803-04, when the autumn crops utterly failed, and the spring harvest was far below the average. In the great famine of 1837-38, Bud\u00e1un suffered the extreme of misery, thousands died of starvation, grain rose to unattainable prices, and the police found themselves powerless for the preservation of order. In 1860, the autumn crops again failed, and no rain fell after September; the spring sowings accordingly perished, and many persons died of starvation. The price of grain began to rise in August 1860, and continued high till March 1861, when it gradually fell, and in October ordinary rates once more prevailed. In 1868, the rains partially failed, and distress arose in 1869, as the autumn harvest had only produced half its average yield; but timely showers in January and February 1869 prevented the scarcity from ever reaching famine pitch, although relief operations on an extended scale became necessary.\n\nCommerce, etc.\u2014The trade of Bud\u00e1un, which is chiefly confined to agricultural produce, centres in the three towns of Bud\u00e1un, Sahaswan, and Bils\u00ed. The last-named mart forms the main distributing agency for European goods and imported wares in this part of Rohilkhand. Its imports include chintz, salt, groceries, iron, metal-work, and p\u00e1n; while its exports consist chiefly of sugar, grain, and leather. The only manufacturing industries, apart from the simplest forms of weaving, the making of rough agricultural tools, and of brass or earthen domestic vessels, is indigo manufacture and sugar-refining. The principal seat of the former is at Bils\u00ed, where a European firm has a large factory, with branches in other parts of the District. A great fair takes place at Kakora, on the last day of K\u00e1rtik, attended by about 100,000 persons. Other large fairs are held at Ch\u00e1opur (20,000 visitors), Sukhela (10,000), Lakhanpur (7000), and B\u00e1ra Chirra (5000). The Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway cuts the District in two places. The main line from Bareilly (Bareli) to Chandausi traverses the north-eastern angle for a length of 16 miles, with 3 stations\u2014namely, Kareng\u00ed (better known as Mahm\u00fadpur), Dabt\u00fara, and Asafpur. The Morad\u00e1b\u00e1d and Aligarh branch runs through the north-western corner for a distance of 13 miles to R\u00e1jgh\u00e1t on the Ganges, where it crosses the river by an iron bridge. The two stations on this branch of the line are Balral\u00e1 and Dhan\u00e1ri. Good roads connect all the principal centres of population; the most important being that from Bareilly to H\u00e1thras, through Bud\u00e1un and Ujh\u00e1ni, crossing the Ganges at Kachhlagh\u00e1t by a bridge.\nof boats. Four other similar bridges exist at An\u00fapshahr, R\u00e1jgh\u00e1t, K\u00e1dirchauk, and Surajpurgh\u00e1t\u2014the last two on the Etah and Fatehgarh roads respectively. The Ganges is navigable throughout the year for boats of large burthen.\n\n**Administration.**\u2014The District staff usually comprises a Collector-Magistrate, 1 Joint and 1 Assistant Magistrate, 1 Deputy Magistrate, and 5 tahsild\u00e1rs. The Judge of Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur holds civil jurisdiction over the entire District; the criminal jurisdiction being under the charge of the additional Judge of Bijnaur and Bud\u00e1un; the Judge of Bareilly has charge of the remainder. Four munsif's courts are also established at East and West Bud\u00e1un, Sahasw\u00e1n, and Bisauli. The whole amount of revenue\u2014imperial, municipal, and local\u2014raised in the District in 1876, amounted to \u00a3149,908, of which \u00a3102,914, or a little more than two-thirds, was contributed by the land-tax. In 1880\u201381, the imperial revenue amounted to \u00a3120,544, of which \u00a3103,625 was derived from the land; the cost of officials and police of all kinds, in the same year, was \u00a320,644. The regular police force in 1880 numbered 393 officers and men, besides a municipal or town force of 222 men of all ranks, maintained at a total cost of \u00a36804, of which \u00a35490 was contributed from provincial and \u00a31314 from local funds. In addition, there were 2031 village watchmen (chaukid\u00e1rs), maintained at an estimated cost of \u00a37335. The District contains but one jail, which had a daily average of 379 prisoners in 1881, including 14 females. There were 7 Imperial and 11 District post-offices in 1877, besides 5 telegraph stations on the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway. The number of Government aided or inspected schools in 1881\u201382 was 160, with a roll of 4239 pupils on 31st March 1882. This is exclusive of unaided or uninspected schools. The Census Report returned 4828 boys and 225 girls as under instruction in 1881, besides 12,475 males and 211 females as able to read and write, but not under instruction. The Government District school is of the lower middle grade, and has a boarding-house attached, for boys from a distance. There are aided schools under the superintendence of the American Methodist Episcopal Mission. For fiscal and administrative purposes, the District is divided into 5 tahsils and 11 parg\u00e1ns, containing, at the date of settlement in 1870, an aggregate number of 2140 estates, held by 30,104 registered proprietors or coparceners. Municipalities have been established at Bud\u00e1un, Bilsi, Ujh\u00e1n\u00ed, and Sahasw\u00e1n. In 1880\u201381, their joint revenue amounted to \u00a33252, or 1s. 4\u00bdd. per head of population (51,690) within municipal limits.\n\n**Medical Aspects.**\u2014The climate of Bud\u00e1un resembles that of other Districts in Rohilkhand, being somewhat cooler and moister than the adjacent portions of the Do\u00e1b, owing to the greater proximity of the hills and the damp submontane tract. The average rainfall\nduring 31 years has amounted to 32.49 inches per annum. The maximum during this period was 44.2 inches in 1871, and the minimum 14.0 inches in 1868, when the danger of famine was imminent. The mean annual temperature reached 76\u00b0 F. in 1871, with a maximum monthly average of 91\u00b0 in June, and a minimum of 58\u00b0 F. in January. The total number of deaths recorded in the year 1880 was 24,951, or 27.52 per thousand of the population. Charitable dispensaries have been established at Bud\u00e1un, Sahasw\u00e1n, Gunraur, Isl\u00e1mnnagar, Bisauli, D\u00e1taganj, Useh\u00e1t, and Bilsi. These eight institutions afforded relief in 1881 to 60,172 persons, of whom 1624 were in-door patients.

Area, 466 square miles, of which 309 are under cultivation. Population (1881) 222,312. Land revenue, \u00a321,337; total revenue, \u00a324,210; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a355,340. The Sub-division contains 2 civil and 6 criminal courts, with two police stations (th\u00e1n\u00e1s); strength of regular police, 56 men; village watchmen (chaukid\u00e1rs), 326.\n\n**Bud\u00e1un.**\u2014City, municipality, and administrative head-quarters of Bud\u00e1un District, North-Western Provinces. Lat. 28\u00b0 2' 30\" N., long. 79\u00b0 9' 45\" E. Lies about a mile east of the left bank of the river Sot, and consists of an old and a new town. The former stands on a commanding eminence, and contains the fort, the ruins of whose enormous ramparts of early architecture gird it round on three sides. Handsome mosque, originally a Hindu temple, built of massive stone, and crowned by a dome of singular beauty. Besides the usual District Courts, Bud\u00e1un contains a dispensary, school, municipal hall, jail, church, and chapel of the American Methodist Mission, which maintains several girls\u2019 schools in different parts of the town. Although intersected at all points by good metalled roads, the town stands apart from the modern course of traffic, owing to the growth of railways, which have somewhat diverted its trade. Population (1881) 33,680, namely, 19,492 Muhammadans, 14,134 Hindus, and 54 Christians; area of town site, 415 acres. Municipal income (1881-82) \u00a32211, or an average of 1s. 3\u00bdd. per head of the population. Bud\u00e1un was founded, according to tradition, by Budh, an Ahar prince, about 905 A.D., and held by his descendants till the invasion of Sayyid S\u00e1l\u00e1r Mas\u00e1\u00fad Gh\u00e1zi, nephew of Mahm\u00fad of Ghazn\u00ed, in 1028. Sacked by Kutab-ud-d\u00edn in 1186. The city formed the seat of government for a sark\u00e1r under the Path\u00e1ns and\nMughals, but it was almost entirely destroyed by fire in 1571. During the reign of Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n (1627\u20131658), the seat of the Governorship was removed from Bud\u00e1un to Bareilly. On the death of the Emperor Farukh Siyyar in 1719, the Naw\u00e1b of Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d seized the city, from whose son it was wrested about thirty years later, by the Rohill\u00e1s under H\u00e1fiz Rahmat. In 1774, Bud\u00e1un, with the rest of Rohilkhand, was annexed by the Naw\u00e1b Waz\u00edr of Oudh, whose deputies governed the city till its cession to the British in 1801. On the outbreak of the rebellion in May 1857, the treasury guard at Bud\u00e1un mutinied, and being joined by the townspeople, broke open the jail, and burned the civil station. A Native Government was then established, and remained in power till General Penny\u2019s victory at Kakra in the following April, when the rebel governor fled the city, and order was again re-established.\n\n**Buddh Gay\u00e1** (or Bodh Gay\u00e1).\u2014Village in Gay\u00e1 District, Bengal. Lat. 24\u00b0 41\u2032 45\u2033 N., long. 85\u00b0 2\u2032 4\u2033 E. Situated about 6 miles south of Gay\u00e1 town, on the west bank of the Ph\u00e1lg\u00fa or Nil\u00e1jan river, just above its junction with the Moh\u00e1na. The ruins at this place are among the most interesting and famous in India, for it is acknowledged to have been the dwelling-place of Sakya Muni or Buddha, the princely founder of the Buddhist religion, who flourished in the 6th century before the Christian era. According to General Cunningham, Buddha had ascended a mountain to the south-east of Gay\u00e1, called Pr\u00e1gbodhi, for the purpose of dwelling in silent solitude on its summit; but being disturbed by the tremblings caused by the flight of the god of the mountain, he descended on the south-west side, and went 2\u00bd miles to the pipal tree (Ficus religiosa) at Buddh Gay\u00e1. Midway in the descent, there was a cave (mentioned by the Chinese pilgrim Fa Hian) where Buddha rested with his legs crossed. Under the pipal tree the sage sat in mental abstraction for five years, until he obtained Buddha-hood\u2014absolute enlightenment. This celebrated bodh\u00ed dr\u00fam, or Tree of Wisdom, has long ago disappeared; but a lineal descendant of the famous fig is now within the courtyard of the great temple, and is reverenced as the sacred tree itself both by Hindus and Buddhists, many of the latter coming from Nep\u00e1l, Arakan, Burma, and Ceylon on pilgrimage to the holy spot. To the east is a massive brick temple, described below. The r\u0101jasth\u00e1n or palace in the northern portion of the ruins, now partially restored, measures 1482 feet by 1006 in its greatest dimensions; it was probably the residence of the Buddhist King Asoka (250 B.C.), and his successors on the throne of Magadha. Immediately south of the palace, and on the spot where Buddha sat under the sacred pipal tree, in the 6th century B.C., King Asoka built a small temple, circa 250 B.C. Recent explorations have brought to light remains of this ancient shrine buried under the foundations of the existing one, which was built by a Burmese\nking in the early years of the 14th century A.D. on the site of Asoka's early vihar, described by Hwen Thsang.\n\nThe temple of the 14th century fell in its turn into decay, and its ruins have become the subject of antiquarian research. General Cunningham has published the results of his labours in the Journal of the Archaeological Survey. A few years ago, the Burmese Government attempted a restoration of the great temple, but without success. The Bengal Government thereupon undertook the work, and placed it in the hands of Mr. J. D. Beglar, who has kindly furnished the following description of this celebrated shrine. The existing temple of Buddh Gay\u00e1 consists externally of a tall spire about 47 feet square at the base, rising from a terrace 80 feet long by 78 feet wide. The terrace itself is 30 feet high, and the spire, without the pinnacle, rises to a height of nearly 160 feet above the floor below. The tower is hollow, and consists of four tiers of chambers, the two lower chambers of which have been always accessible. A third chamber has long been visible, owing to the falling off of the masonry in front; and the existence of a fourth, reaching to the very top of the square portion of the tower, was disclosed during the recent repairs. The lowest chamber originally enshrined a clay figure of Buddha, which was demolished by the Burmese during the repairs they undertook in 1878, and replaced by a misshapen gilt brick and mortar figure. This has in its turn been removed and replaced by the largest stone figure of Buddha that could be found in Buddh Gay\u00e1. The figure rests on a great raised throne of stone, which itself encloses and buries a more ancient small throne, within which were found deposits of precious stones which have been placed in the Museum at Calcutta.\n\nThe upper chamber contains a masonry throne, also enclosing an inner and smaller one, but it has been always empty. The temple was enclosed within what is known as the Buddhist railing, portions of which were found buried beneath the accumulated debris of centuries, and have been as far as possible set up in their original positions. The character of the inscriptions, as well as the boldness and style of the sculptured scenes and ornamentations, indicate the date of the construction of the railing to be the 3rd century B.C. Several pillars of this interesting railing were, however, carried off many years ago by the mahant or head priest of the adjacent monastery, and now support the verandah round the great quadrangle of the mahant's residence.\n\nWithin the court of the temple, remains of all the ancient buildings mentioned by Hwen Thsang have been found buried under an accumulation of rubbish to a depth of nearly 30 feet in places. The outside of the wall of the great monastery, adjoining and to the north of the great temple, mentioned by Hwen Thsang, has also been exhumed and found in a fair state of preservation. It is adorned with\nniches and sculptured figures, mostly, however, in fragments. Excavations to the south of the temple have brought to light a handsome flight of stone steps leading into what was a tank, with remains of ornamental cloisters on the north bank. On the east, and in front of the temple, besides numerous minor objects of interest, the remains have been exhumed of a stone gateway consisting of very massive pillars and architraves profusely ornamented. On the west side of the temple, the fall of a wall in 1880 disclosed the original back wall of the temple. Buried 30 feet under the debris, a handsomely ornamented throne was found, in the vicinity of which were fragments very much decayed, of the holy pipal tree. The accumulation of rubbish has caused the elevation of the modern representative of this ancient pipal to a height of 45 feet above the original plan of the courtyard. A deposit of precious stones was also found here within a plaster figure of Buddha, which was seated in a niche immediately over the throne. These relics, too, have been placed in the Calcutta Museum.\n\nPilgrims visit Buddh Gay\u00e1 by thousands, and deposit their offerings under the sacred pipal tree; but since the abolition of the fees formerly levied, the exact number cannot be accurately estimated. Close by the temple is a large convent of Sany\u00e1s\u00eds, the mahant or abbot of which shows visitors over the convent after they have visited the temple.\n\nBuddh Gay\u00e1 is now easily reached by the Patn\u00e1 and Gay\u00e1 State line, which leaves the East India Railway at Bankipur, and brings pilgrims to Gay\u00e1 station six miles by road from the Buddh Gay\u00e1 shrines.\n\n**Buddhain** (or Buddhavana; 'Fo-tho-fa-na' of Hwen Thsang).\u2014Hill in Gay\u00e1 District, Bengal; 17 miles north-east of Kurkih\u00e1r village.

Lat. $29^\\circ 16' 50''$ N., long. $77^\\circ 31' 10''$ E.; population (1881) 6232, namely, 3937 Hindus, 2251 Musalm\u00e1ns, 43 Jains, and unspecified. A small municipal income is derived from a house-tax for police and conservancy purposes under the provisions of Act xx. of 1856. The outer walls of the houses adjoin each other so as to form a kind of fortification, through which four openings, called gates, give access to the town. B\u00e1z\u00e1r, first-class police station, post-office. Malarious fever occasionally prevails. During the Mutiny the old fort of Budh\u00e1na was occupied by Khair\u00e1t\u00ed Kh\u00e1n of Parasauli, with the assistance of the Jaula people, but recovered on the 15th of September 1857.\n\n**Budh\u00e1t\u00e1.**\u2014Village in Khuln\u00e1 District, Bengal.

Small fair held weekly on Mondays, attended by 100 persons.\n\nBuffalo Rocks (Liep Kywon, or 'Turtle Island').\u2014Lat. 16\u00b0 19' to 16\u00b0 22' N., long. 94\u00b0 12' E., bearing nearly s.\u00bdw. from Calventura Rocks, and distant therefrom 10 or 11 leagues. A group of rugged detached rocks extending nearly north and south for 3 miles, and lying off the coast, 29 miles from shore, bearing north from the western extremity of Cape Negrais, British Burma. The North Buffalo is about half a mile to the south-west of South Buffalo Island, and separated from it by the Perforated and Pillar Rocks. On the west side of the rocks the soundings are regular\u201420 fathoms about a mile from them, and 50 or 60 fathoms at 5 leagues distant.\n\nB\u00fakera.\u2014Village in Alahy\u00e1r-jo-Tando t\u00e1luk, Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Sind, Bombay Presidency; 18 miles east from Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d. Population about 700, chiefly Musalm\u00e1ns, engaged in agriculture, trade, and fishing. There are four tombs here held in some repute by the Musalm\u00e1n community; one, that of Shaikh Banapotr\u00e1, is said to be 500 years old; another, P\u00edr Fazl Sh\u00e1h's, 400 years old. A fair is held at these tombs twice a year, and is attended by thousands of Musalm\u00e1ns.\n\nBukkacherla.\u2014Village in Anant\u00e1pur District, Madras Presidency. The site of an important water project in connection with the T\u00fang\u00e1bhadra irrigation system. This project, now completed, consists of anicuts across the Penn\u00e1r and Badr\u00e1purnala rivers; a canal 18 miles in length and 52 yards broad, with an average depth of 7 feet of water, to feed the Anant\u00e1pur, Sing\u00e1n\u00e1malla, Kondap\u00far, and Per\u00far tanks; and a great reservoir in the place of the present Bukkacherla tank; erected at a cost of \u00a3135,150; irrigates about 11,000 acres of waste land, which now yields in land revenue \u00a36400 per annum.\n\nBukkapatnam.\u2014Town in Anant\u00e1pur District, Madras Presidency; situated on the Trunk Road from Bangalore to Bellary. Population (1881) 3680. The station of a sub-magistrate and police force. Besieged in 1740 by the P\u00e1leg\u00e1r of Raidr\u00fag. The P\u00e1leg\u00e1r of Bellary raised the siege, and, having been admitted as an ally within the fortifications, seized the place. The tank here is the largest in the District, and possesses some historical interest. It is formed by a dam, erected 400 years ago across the Chitr\u00e1vati river, connecting the two low ranges of hills which flank that stream, and irrigates 3500 acres, yielding \u00a32100 per annum in land revenue.\n\nBukkar\u00e1yasam\u00fadr\u00e1m.\u2014Village in Anant\u00e1pur District, Madras Presidency.\u2014See Bakkarayasamudram.\nBukkur (Bakhar).\u2014Fortified island in the river Indus, lying between the towns of Sukkur (Sakhar) and Rohri, in Shik\u00e1rpur District, Sind, Bombay Presidency. Lat. $27\u00b0 42' 45''$ N., and long. $68\u00b0 56' 30''$ E. Bukkur is a rock of limestone, oval in shape, 800 yards long, 300 wide, and about 25 feet in height. The channel separating it from the Sukkur shore is not more than 100 yards wide, and, when the river is at its lowest, about 15 feet deep in the middle. The eastern channel, or that which divides it from Rohri, is much broader, being, during the same state of the river, about 400 yards wide, with a depth of 30 feet in the middle. The Government telegraph line from Rohri to Sukkur crosses the river here by the island of Bukkur. A little to the north of Bukkur, and separated from it by a narrow channel of easy passage, is the small isle of Khw\u00e1ja Khizr (or Jind P\u00edr), containing a shrine of much sanctity; while to the south of Bukkur is another islet known as S\u00e1dh Bela, well covered with foliage, and also possessing some sacred shrines.\n\nAlmost the whole of the island of Bukkur is occupied by the fortress, the walls of which are double, and from 30 to 35 feet high, with numerous bastions; they are built partly of burnt and unburnt brick, are loopholed, and have two gateways, one facing Rohri on the east, and the other Sukkur on the west. The fort presents a fine appearance from the river, and has a show of great strength, which in reality it does not possess. Until 1876, Bukkur was used as a jail subsidiary to that at Shik\u00e1rpur. That Bukkur, owing to its insulated position, must always have been considered a stronghold of some importance under Native rule, is evidenced by its being so frequently a bone of contention between different states. So early as A.D. 1327, when Sind was an appanage of the Delhi Empire, Bukkur seems to have been a place of note, from the fact of trustworthy persons being employed by the Emperor Muhammed Tughlak to command there. During the reign of the Samma princes, this fort seems to have changed hands several times, being occasionally under their rule, and at times under that of Delhi. During the reign of Sh\u00e1h Beg Argh\u00fan, the fortifications of Bukkur appear to have been partially, if not wholly, rebuilt, the fort of Alor being broken up to supply the requisite material. In 1574, the place was delivered up to one Kesh\u00fa Kh\u00e1n, a servant of the Mughal Emperor Akbar Sh\u00e1h. In 1736, the fortress fell into the hands of the Kalhora princes, and at a subsequent date into that of the Afgh\u00e1ns, by whom it was retained till captured by Mir Rustam Kh\u00e1n of Khairpur. In 1839, during the First Afghan war, the fort of Bukkur was ceded by the Khairpur Mirs to the British, to be occupied by them, and it so remained till the conquest of the Province in 1843. Bukkur was the principal British arsenal in Sind during the Afghan and Sind campaigns.\n\nBulandshahr.\u2014District in the Lieutenant-Governorship of the\nNorth-Western Provinces, lying between $28^\\circ 3' 30''$ and $28^\\circ 42' 45''$ N. lat., and between $77^\\circ 20'$ and $78^\\circ 31' 45''$ E. long. Area (1881) 1914.9 square miles; population, 924,822. Bulandshahr is a District of the Meerut (M\u00edrath or Merath) Division. It is bounded on the north by Meerut District; on the west by the river Jumna; on the south by Aligarh; and on the east by the Ganges. The administrative headquarters are, on account of its central situation, at the town of Bulandshahr, but Khurja is the most populous city in the District.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014Bulandshahr forms a portion of the Do\u00e1b, or alluvial plain, enclosed between the Ganges and the Jumna, and presents the usual sameness which characterizes all parts of that monotonous tract. Its surface exhibits to the eye an almost uniform level of cultivated soil, stretching from one great boundary river to the other, with a scarcely perceptible watershed in its centre separating their respective tributaries. The plain follows the general slope of the Do\u00e1b from north-west to south-east, as indicated by the courses of the two main streams themselves, no less than by those of the minor channels. The average elevation is about 650 feet above the sea. Shortly before reaching the bed of either arterial river, the central plateau descends abruptly by a series of terraces, scored with deeply-cut ravines, into the kh\u00e1dir or low-lying alluvial valley which forms the actual bank. The upland plain, here as elsewhere throughout the Do\u00e1b, is naturally dry and barren, intersected by sandy ridges, and rapidly drained by small watercourses, which have excavated for themselves a network of petty gorges in the loose and friable soil. But this unpromising region has been turned into a garden of cereals, cotton, and dye-plants by the industry of its inhabitants and the enterprise of its modern rulers, especially through the instrumentality of artificial irrigation. The Ganges Canal passes through the whole length of the District from north to south, entering in three main branches, one of which again divides into two near the town of Sikandar\u00e1b\u00e1d. The central branch is navigable throughout the District; and the whole system is distributed to the fields around by 626 miles of lesser ramifications. The Fatehgarh branch of the Lower Ganges Canal also intersects the entire length of the District, and is largely utilized for irrigation. Under the beneficial influence of the water so supplied, cultivation has spread widely in Bulandshahr. There is now little waste land in the District, except a few patches of worthless jungle in the neighbourhood of the Ganges; and even this is rapidly disappearing wherever the soil is sufficiently good to repay the cost of tillage. There is also comparatively little barren land known as \u00fasar, covered with the white saline efflorescence called reh, and incapable of producing any vegetation, and the unprofitable area has decreased in Bulandshahr District since the date of the settlement.\nThe Ganges flows along the north-eastern border of the District for a distance of 45 miles, with a maximum velocity of current in time of flood of 12 feet per second, and a minimum velocity in the cold season of 3 feet. The river is liable to the formation of shoals, and constant alterations of its main channel; its course changes yearly, and large portions of land on its north-eastern bank are annually cut away and deposited elsewhere. The south-western bank alters but little, being protected at many places by strong headlands of hard clay and kankar, reaching 20 feet above high flood-level; on the north side of the river the banks are low and shelving, and at a point near Ahar during floods the low-lying surrounding country is liable to inundation. The Ganges is navigable all the year round, but during February and March the water is often very shallow in places. The second boundary river, the Jumna, first touches upon the District opposite Delhi, and then flows along its south-west border for 50 miles, with a flood velocity of about $4\\frac{1}{2}$ feet per second, and a cold weather velocity of about 18 inches. There is no irrigation from the Jumna, and the navigation is chiefly confined to the rafting of timber and the transport of grain and cotton in small quantities. The bed of the river is composed of micaceous silt, and there are no rapids, or even eddies, except during the rains. Of the internal streams, the K\u00e1li N\u00e1di or K\u00e1lindi divides the District into two parts, entering it from Meerut on the north, and, flowing in a tortuous south and south-easterly direction for about 50 miles, passes into Aligarh. In Bulandshahr, the K\u00e1li N\u00e1di is little more than a natural drain to carry off the superfluous water from the surrounding country. It is navigable in the rains by boats of about 4 tons burthen, but it is seldom, if at all, used for this purpose. The Hindan also enters this District from Meerut, and after a winding and irregular course of about 20 miles, falls into the Jumna at Mangrauli village. It flows between high shelving banks, and is not a navigable stream. In the hot weather the water is sometimes so low that not even a small boat could cross it. Other minor streams are the Karon, Patwai, and Chhoiya.\n\nThere are no reserved forests in Bulandshahr, but isolated groves of various sorts of fruit and timber trees are numerous. The commonest and most useful tree is the kakar (Acacia arabica), the wood of which is hard and tough, and used for making agricultural implements, cart-wheels, boxes, etc., and also for burning into charcoal. Shisham (Dalbergia sissoo), a well-grained heavy wood, is largely used for beams, planks, and for articles of furniture. Dh\u00e1k (Butea frondosa) is mainly used for fuel in the shape of charcoal. The country has been much denuded of trees of late years, owing to the great demand for fuel for the railway. Salt, saltpetre, and kankar are the only minerals worthy of notice. The wild animals include hyenas, wolves, antelopes, hog,\nand jackals. The *magar* and *gharial*, two species of crocodile, are found in the Ganges and Jumna.\n\n**History.**\u2014The early traditions of the people assert that the modern District of Bulandshahr formed a portion of the great Pandava kingdom of Hastinapur; and that, after that city was cut away by the Ganges, the tract was administered by a Governor who resided at the ancient town of Ahar. Whatever credence may be placed in these myths, we know from the evidence of inscriptions that the District was inhabited by Gaur Br\u00e1hmans, and ruled over by the Gupta dynasty, in the 3rd century of our era. Few glimpses of historic light have been cast upon the annals of this region before the advent of the Muhammadians, with whose approach authentic history begins for the whole of Northern India. In 1018, when Mahm\u00fad of Ghazn\u00ed arrived at Baran (as the town of Bulandshahr is still officially called to the present day), he found it in possession of a native prince named Hardatta. The presence of so doughty an apostle as Mahm\u00fad naturally affected the Hindu ruler; and accordingly the R\u00e1j\u00e1 himself, and ten thousand followers, came forth, says the Musalm\u00e1n historian, \u2018and proclaimed their anxiety for conversion and their rejection of idols.\u2019 This timely repentance saved their lives and property for the time; but Mahm\u00fad\u2019s raid was the occasion for a great immigration towards the Do\u00e1b of many fresh tribes, who still hold a place in the District. In 1193, Kutab-ud-d\u00edn appeared before Baran, which was for some time strenuously defended by the Dor R\u00e1j\u00e1, Chandra Sen; but through the treachery of his kinsman Jaip\u00e1l, the town was at last captured by the Musalm\u00e1n force. The traitorous Hindu accepted the faith of Isl\u00e1m and the *chaudhri*-ship of Baran, where his descendants still reside, and own some small landed property. The 14th century is marked as the epoch when many of the present tribes inhabiting Bulandshahr first gained a footing in the region. Numerous R\u00e1jput adventurers poured into the defenceless country, and expelled the unhappy Meos from their lands and villages. This was also the period of the early Mughal invasions; so that the condition of the Do\u00e1b was one of extreme wretchedness, caused by the combined ravages of pestilence, war, and famine, with the usual concomitant of internal anarchy. The firm establishment of the Mughal dynasty gave a long respite of tranquillity and comparatively settled government to these harassed Provinces. They shared in the administrative reconstruction of Akbar, and their annals are devoid of incident during the flourishing reigns of his great successors. Here, as in so many other Districts, the proselytizing zeal of Aurangzeb has left permanent effects in the large number of Musalm\u00e1n converts; but Bulandshahr was too near the court to afford much opportunity for those rebellions and royal conquests which make up the staple elements of Mughal history. During the disastrous decline of the Imperial\npower, which dates from the accession of Bah\u00e1dur Sh\u00e1h in 1707, the country round Baran was a prey to the same misfortunes which overtook all the more fertile Provinces of the Empire. The G\u00fajars and J\u00e1ts, always to be found in the foreground upon every occasion of disturbance, exhibited their usual turbulent spirit; and many of their chieftains carved out principalities from the villages of their neighbours. But as Baran was at this time a dependency of Koil, it has no proper history of its own during the 18th century, apart from that of Aligarh District. Under the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 rule it continued to be administered from Koil; and when that town, with the adjoining fort of Aligarh, was captured by the British forces in 1803, Bulandshahr and the surrounding country were incorporated into the newly-formed District. In 1817, they were transferred from Aligarh to Meerut; and in 1823, the present District was organized by the union of the northern parg\u00e1sas of Aligarh with the southern ones of Meerut. From that date till 1857, the peaceful course of history in Bulandshahr is only marked by the opening of the Ganges Canal.\n\nThe Mutiny of 1857 was ushered in at Bulandshahr by the revolt of the 9th Native Infantry, which took place on the 21st of May, shortly after the outbreak at Aligarh. The officers were compelled to fly to Meerut, and Bulandshahr was plundered by a band of rebellious G\u00fajars. Its recovery was a matter of great importance, as it lies on the main road from Agra and Aligarh to Meerut. Accordingly, a small body of volunteers was despatched from Meerut for the purpose of retaking the town, which they were enabled to do by the aid of the Dehra Gurkh\u00e1s. Shortly afterwards, however, the Gurkh\u00e1s marched off to join General Wilson\u2019s column, and the G\u00fajars once more rose in rebellion. Walid\u00e1d Kh\u00e1n of M\u00e1l\u00e1garh put himself at the head of the movement, which proved strong enough to drive the small European garrison out of the District. From the beginning of July till the end of September, Walid\u00e1d held Bulandshahr without opposition, and commanded the whole line of communications with Agra. Meantime, internal feuds went on as briskly as in other revolted Provinces, the old proprietors often ousting by force the possessors of their former estates. But on the 25th of September, Colonel Greathed\u2019s flying column set out from Gh\u00e1zi\u00e1b\u00e1d for Bulandshahr, whence Walid\u00e1d was expelled after a sharp engagement, and forced to fly across the Ganges. On the 4th of October, the District was regularly occupied by Colonel Farquhar, and order was rapidly restored. The police were at once reorganized, while measures of repression were adopted against the refractory G\u00fajars, many of whom still continued under arms. It was necessary to march against the rebels in Etah early in 1858, but the tranquillity of Bulandshahr itself was not again disturbed. Throughout the progress of the Mutiny, the J\u00e1ts almost all took the side of Govern-\nment, while the Gujars and Musalm\u00e1n R\u00e1jputs proved our most irreconcilable enemies.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The earliest attempt to enumerate the inhabitants of Bulandshahr, made in 1847, returned a total population of 699,093 souls, or 376 to the square mile. In 1853, the District was included in the first regular Census; when it was then found, in spite of a considerable transfer of villages to Delhi and Aligarh, that the population amounted to 778,342 souls, or 427 to the square mile. At the Census of 1865, the numbers had risen to 800,431 souls. In 1872, the returns showed a further advance to the total of 936,667, being an increase of 136,236 persons in the short space of seven years. During the next nine years, however, the population showed a decrease, the Census of 1881 returning the numbers at 924,822, or 11,845 less than in 1872. This decrease is attributable to a very severe fever epidemic in 1879, which is said to have more than decimated the population. The Census of 1881 was taken over an area of 1914'9 square miles, the returns giving the number of males at 491,958, and the females at 432,864; total, 924,822, residing in 1510 villages and 96,446 houses. Proportion of males in total population, 52'1 per cent. The preponderance of males is due, in part, to the former prevalence of female infanticide; but this practice, which all the vigilance of Government was long unable to suppress, is now disappearing under the stringent regulations put in force under the Act of 1870. With regard to religious distinctions, Hindus numbered 748,256, or 80'9 per cent.; Musalm\u00e1ns, 175,458, or 19'1 per cent.; Jains, 967; Sikhs, 24; P\u00e1rs\u00eds, 2; and Christians, 115. Amongst Hindus, the Br\u00e1hmans muster very strongly, the enumeration disclosing as many as 93,265 persons belonging to the sacred class. They hold between them a large number of entire villages, besides being part-proprietors of many others. A portion of one Br\u00e1hman clan in this District has embraced Isl\u00e1m, though still maintaining its relationship with the Hindu branch. The second great class, that of the R\u00e1jputs, is also numerous, being returned at 77,132 souls. They are the most important landowning element in Bulandshahr, holding altogether 464 entire villages, together with shares in several more. Badg\u00fajars are their wealthiest clan, owning nearly one-seventh of the total area. A large branch of them are Musalm\u00e1ns, who, till quite lately, have kept up many Hindu customs in their marriage ceremonies and other social observances. To the present day they will not slaughter cattle, and retain the Hindu prefix of Th\u00e1kur or Kunw\u00e1r as a title of respect. The Bh\u00e1ls, another R\u00e1jput clan, are also divided into a Hindu and a Musalm\u00e1n branch. It is noticeable in each case that the Muhammadan families are wealthier and more powerful than their kinsmen of the ancient faith. The Baniy\u00e1s or trading classes number 41,921 persons, and hold 36 villages, nearly all of which have\nbeen acquired under British rule. But the great mass of the population in Bulandshahr, as in all parts of the North-Western Provinces, belongs to the classes enumerated in the Census returns as 'other Hindu castes,' aggregating 535,938 souls. Amongst them, the most numerous are the Chamars (151,541 persons), after whom come the Jats (53,380), Gujars (50,710), Lodhas (50,150), and Bhangis (30,531). The Musalmans, who form an important element in the proprietary body, are classified according to sect into Sunnis, 168,305, and Shi\u00e1s, 7153. Among the Muhammadans are included 29,075, originally belonging to Hindu castes, of whom upwards of three-fourths, or 15,902, are Rajputs by race. Of the Christian population of 115,18 are natives, and the remainder Europeans or Eurasians. One large estate of 63 villages is in the hands of a Eurasian family. The total agricultural population in 1881 was returned at 515,648. The District contains 12 towns with a population exceeding 5000\u2014namely, Khurja, 27,190; Bulandshahr or Baran, 17,863; Sikandarabad, 16,479; Shikarpur, 10,708; Jahangirabad, 10,319; Anupshahr, 8234; Dibai, 8216; Siyana, 6532; Jewar, 6219; Galaothi, 5404; Aurangabad, 5210; and Dankaur, 5122. These figures show an urban population of 127,496 persons, leaving 797,326 for the rural population. The 1510 villages and towns in Bulandshahr are thus classified in the Census Report, according to population:\u2014335 contain less than two hundred inhabitants; 599 from two to five hundred; 397 from five hundred to a thousand; 127 from one to two thousand; 29 from two to three thousand; 11 from three to five thousand; 7 from five to ten thousand; 2 from ten to fifteen thousand; 2 from fifteen to twenty thousand; and 1 upwards of twenty thousand inhabitants. The language in use in the country districts is Hindi, the Musalmans of the towns speak Urdu, and the town Hindus use a dialect compounded of both. As regards the occupations of the people, the Census Report classified the male population into the following six main divisions:\u2014(1) Professional class, including Government officials and the learned professions, 8847; (2) domestic servants, hotel and lodging-house keepers, etc., 1793; (3) commercial class, including merchants, traders, carriers, etc., 7969; (4) agricultural and pastoral class, including gardeners, 183,496; (5) manufacturing, artisan, and other industrial classes, 77,209; (6) indefinite and non-productive (comprising 38,304 labourers, 29 men of rank and property without occupation, and 174,401 unspecified, including male children), 212,734.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014During the last thirty-five years, the cultivated area of Bulandshahr has increased by nearly 100,000 acres, and the margin of cultivable soil is still being rapidly reclaimed. In 1882, the land under tillage amounted to 857,445 acres, almost equally divided between spring and rain crops. Wheat, barley, and gram are the staple products\nof the *rabi* harvest; and common millets and pulses of the *kharif*. Indigo is also widely cultivated, forming one of the main commercial crops; and cotton, safflower, and tobacco are grown in all parts of the District. In 1882, the acreage under the principal crops was returned as follows:\u2014*Jo\u00e1r* and *bij\u00e1d*, 210,837 acres; wheat and barley, 287,893 acres; cotton, 69,685 acres; Indian corn, 64,526 acres; pulses, 51,468 acres. The advantages of irrigation are thoroughly appreciated in Bulandshahr, more than one-fourth of the cultivated area being artificially supplied with water. In 1882, as much as 308,110 acres were thus treated, and since that period the amount of irrigated land has increased. Canals alone afforded water to 148,141 acres; but even this is far from showing the whole benefit derived from these undertakings, as they have been instrumental in promoting the growth of valuable export products, such as cotton, indigo, and oil-seeds, rather than cheap food-stuffs. Canal irrigation is both cheaper and better than the old method of watering from wells, and by its comparative certainty is eliminating the element of chance from the agriculture of the District. Manuring is little practised, as the expense is beyond the limited means of the cultivators. A model farm was established near Baran for five years for purposes of experiment. Its results were in favour of the belief that under existing circumstances the native methods, developed and improved, are the best for the country and the people. The condition of the peasantry has been greatly ameliorated of late years, and they are now as comfortably off as in any portion of the Do\u00e1b. Few cultivators are in debt to the village bankers, nor are those functionaries acquiring landed property so rapidly as in other Districts. About one-half of the cultivated area is held by tenants-at-will, the remainder being divided between proprietary and hereditary cultivators. Bulandshahr is one of the few Districts in the North-Western Provinces which possesses a territorial aristocracy, residing upon their ancestral estates, and exercising over the people a larger influence, for good or for evil, than any absentee could hope to acquire. Thirteen of them have been invested with magisterial powers within the limits of their respective *pargan\u00e1s*. Rents are payable both in kind and in money, the hereditary cultivators having in either case a prescriptive right to lower rates than the general body of tenants. Best irrigated lands bring in \u00a31, 4s. per acre; best unirrigated, 14s.: outlying lands\u2014irrigated, 8s. to 10s. 6d. per acre; unirrigated, 3s. 6d. to 5s. The best agriculturists are the Lodh\u00e1s, J\u00e1ts, and Jhajhars, and next to them the Tagas and Ahirs. The worst cultivators are the G\u00fajars and Mew\u00e1tis, but the former are steadily improving. The rise in price of agricultural produce has induced cultivators to extend the size of their holdings, and competition for land has consequently become very great. The ordinary prescriptive\nrate for lands paying rent in kind is one-third; and the rate for ordinary cultivators, one-half of the produce. This is usually paid in grain, an allowance being made for all other products grown on the land beside the principal crop. Under another system of division, the standing crop is appraised, and the landlord takes his share in kind, or its equivalent in money,\u2014either one-half, two-fifths, or one-third, etc. Wages and prices have nearly doubled since 1850. Agricultural labourers are usually paid in grain to the value of about 3d. a day, rising at harvest time to as much as 6d.; women obtain two-thirds and boys one-half of a man\u2019s wages. Skilled labourers obtain from \u00a31, 10s. a month, the wages of stonecutters occasionally rising as high as \u00a32. Prices of food-grains ruled as follows in 1882: Gram, 5s. 2d. per cwt.; b\u00e1jr\u00e1, 5s. per cwt.; jo\u00e1r, 4s. 8d. per cwt.; wheat, 5s. 6d. per cwt.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014Bulandshahr suffered in former times from famines due to continued drought; but there is reason to hope that the spread of irrigation has removed this cause of apprehension for the future. The people still remember with horror the scarcity of 1837, which has indelibly imprinted its miseries on the popular mind. Another great famine, also due to drought, occurred in 1860, when the Bulandshahr branch canal was constructed as a relief work, giving occupation to 2500 able-bodied persons; and in addition gratuitous assistance was afforded to 11,396 weak or aged applicants. The District was affected even more severely than its neighbours by the rainless season of 1868\u201369; but, owing doubtless to the great increase of irrigation since 1860, it showed no signs of famine. There were large reserves of grain in store, and exportation went on briskly towards the centres of distress. Prices of course rose greatly above the average, jo\u00e1r being quoted at 12 sers the rupee, or 9s. 4d. per cwt.; but no relief works were needed, and no demand for employment existed. As a rule, when grain rises as high as 8 sers the rupee, or 14s. per cwt., measures of relief should be adopted. However, as canal irrigation is still advancing, such a necessity will probably never again arise. The communications also are excellent, and amply suffice for all purposes of importation, if the local crops should ever prove insufficient for the wants of the inhabitants.\n\nCommerce and Trade, etc.\u2014The chief exports from Bulandshahr are safflower and indigo, but large quantities of cereals are also despatched eastward and westward. The District not only supplies its own needs in the consumption of cotton, but has a surplus of about 36,000 cwts. available for exportation. An\u00fapshahr is a large d\u00e9p\u00f4t for wood and bamboos. The manufactures are unimportant, consisting chiefly of fine muslins at Sikandar\u00e1b\u00e1d, printed cloths at Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr\u00e1b\u00e1d, and carpets at Jewar. Saltpetre is produced in the crude state at 95 factories,\nscattered through the country villages. Common salt was formerly made in large quantities, but its manufacture is now prohibited by law. The country trade is carried on at the local markets, of which the most largely frequented is at Dibh\u00e1i. There the exports of country cloth in 1882, as registered at the railway station, averaged 700 maunds a month. The only religious fair of any importance is that held at An\u00fapshahr, which attracts about 50,000 people from the neighbouring Districts. On the same day, the full moon of the month of K\u00e1rtik, nearly an equal number assemble at R\u00e1jgh\u00e1t, but all come and return by train, and do not stay more than one day. The annual horse show and District fair, held at the head-quarters station in the last week of February, is said to be the most prosperous assembly of its kind in the North-Western Provinces, and is visited by people from all parts of India. Prizes are given to the value of about \u00a3400. The main line of the East Indian Railway passes through the whole length of Bulandshahr, with stations at Dadri, Sikandarabad, Chola, and Khurja. The Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway also traverses the south-eastern corner of the District, crossing the Ganges at R\u00e1jgh\u00e1t, where it has a station, and another at Dibh\u00e1i. The roads are in excellent order; and the Ganges, the Jumna, and the canals are all employed as highways for commercial purposes, so that there is no lack of land or water carriage.\n\nAdministration.\u2014No statistics as to the public accounts of this District in the early period of British rule can now be recovered, as the records were destroyed during the Mutiny. In 1860-61, the revenue amounted to \u00a3222,300, of which \u00a3109,866, or nearly one-half, was contributed by the land-tax. In the same year, the expenditure on all items was \u00a3102,162, or less than half the revenue. In 1870-71, the receipts had risen to \u00a3250,447, of which \u00a3124,121, or almost exactly one-half, was the product of the land-tax. In 1881, the land revenue remained practically the same. This increase of revenue is largely due to the benefits derived from canal irrigation. Meanwhile, the expenditure had fallen to \u00a3100,163, or two-fifths of the receipts. The District is ordinarily administered by a Magistrate-Collector and two Assistants, a Deputy Collector, four tahsild\u00e1rs, and two munsi\u00eds. In 1880-81, there were 29 magisterial and 9 civil courts. The regular and municipal police numbered 879 men of all grades in 1880, maintained at a cost of \u00a38848, of which \u00a36522 were contributed from imperial and \u00a32326 from local funds. There was thus 1 regular policeman to every 2'20 square miles and to every 1052 inhabitants. This force was supplemented by 1974 chaukid\u00e1rs or village watchmen, whose pay, defrayed by the landlords or villagers, amounts to an estimated sum of \u00a37153 annually. The total machinery, therefore, for the protection of person and property consisted of 2853 men, giving\none man to every 323 inhabitants and to every .67 of a square mile. The District contains one jail, the average number of prisoners in which was 964 in 1850, 127 in 1860, 137 in 1870, and 224 in 1880. In 1860, the persons admitted numbered 1321; in 1870, 735; and in 1880, 1716. The total number of persons convicted for all offences, except sanitary cases, great or small, in 1880, was 724, being 1 criminal to every 1121 inhabitants. Education has made rapid advances of late years. In 1845, there were only 187 indigenous schools in Bulandshahr, with a total of 1813 pupils. In 1860, the number of schools had risen to 388, while the roll of pupils amounted to 5882, and the sum expended on education to \u00a32334. In 1871, though the number of schools had decreased to 301, the children under instruction reached the total of 6955, and the sum expended had risen to \u00a33177. In 1880-81, the number of schools under Government inspection, and maintained or supported by the Sate, was 130, with a total of 3938 pupils on the rolls on the 31st March 1882. There were also in the same year 305 elementary indigenous schools, at present (1883) receiving no Government grant-in-aid and uninspected, attended by 3185 pupils, making a total of 435 schools and 7123 pupils. The District is sub-divided into 4 tahsils and 13 parganas, with an aggregate, in 1882, of 2644 estates. The average land revenue paid by each estate amounted in that year to \u00a346, 18s. id. There are 4 municipalities in the District\u2014namely, Khurja, Bulandshahr, An\u00fapshahr, and Sikandar\u00e1b\u00e1d. In 1880-81, their total income amounted to \u00a35599, and their expenditure to \u00a35346.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate of Bulandshahr is very variable, being cold in winter and hot in summer, dry during the sultry spring winds, and extremely moist during the autumn rains. No thermometrical observations have been made in the District. The average rainfall was 32.5 inches in 1867-68, 13.9 in 1868-69 (the year of scarcity), 21.5 in 1869-70, 32.0 in 1870-71, and 25.18 in 1880, the average rainfall for a period of 30 years being 26.12 inches. Malarious fever is the chief endemic disease of Bulandshahr, being especially prevalent during the rainy reason. Small-pox and cholera occasionally appear in an epidemic form. The total number of deaths from all causes reported in 1880 was 26,201, or 28.33 per thousand of the population; and of these, 25,150 deaths were assigned to fever, and 524 to bowel complaints. Charitable dispensaries are established in the towns of Baran, Khurja, Sikandar\u00e1b\u00e1d, and An\u00fapshahr, with a resident Assistant Surgeon at each of the three first, and at which a total of 34,047 persons received medical treatment in 1881. The natives thoroughly appreciate the advantages of skilful treatment and European medicines. During 1870-71 the cattle of the District suffered severely from an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease, accompanied by rinderpest. [For further in-\nformation regarding Bulandshahr, see the Gazetteer of the North-Western Provinces, vol. iii. pp. 1 to 194. Also the Census Report of 1881, and the Annual Administration Reports of the North-Western Provinces from 1880 to 1883.]\n\n**Bulandshahr (or Baran).**\u2014Town and administrative head-quarters of Bulandshahr District, North-Western Provinces, and a station on the main line of the East Indian Railway. Lat. 28\u00b0 24' 11\" N., long. 77\u00b0 54' 15\" E. Population (1881) 17,863, namely, Hindus, 10,148; Muhammadans, 7600; Jains, 56; Christians, 57; and 'others,' 2. Area of town site, 610 acres. Municipal income (1880-81), \u00a31363; average incidence of municipal taxation, 1s. 6\u00bdd. per head of population. Lies on the west side of the K\u00e1li N\u00e1di, and consists of an upper and a lower town, the former and more ancient portion occupying the summit of a high and precipitous hill of artificial formation on the river bank, while the latter or modern town stretches over the low-lying ground to the west. Elevation above sea-level, 741 feet. Baran is a place of great antiquity, coins of Alexander the Great and the Indo-Bactrian kings of Upper India being found to the present day in and around the town. Hardatta, the Dor R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Baran, bought off the first Muhammadan invader, Mahm\u00fad of Ghazn\u00ed, by large presents and apostasy to Isl\u00e1m. Chandra Sen, the last Hindu ruler, died while gallantly defending his fort against Muhammad Ghori. Khw\u00e1ja L\u00e1l Barani, an officer in the Musalm\u00e1n army who fell in the assault, gives his name to a burial-ground across the river, but not a vestige now remains of any monument to his memory. Sculptured columns of early Hindu character, and other architectural fragments, are not infrequently found when any excavations are made; but there are no buildings of any antiquity *in situ*. The oldest is the tomb of Bahlol Kh\u00e1n, a high officer under the Emperor Akbar, which is close to the Christian cemetery; but, like the Jam\u00e1 Masjid or great mosque in the centre of the old town, it is quite plain and unadorned. At the commencement of British rule, Bulandshahr had sunk into utter ruin; there was no b\u00e1z\u00e1r of any kind, but only a small cluster of houses on the top of the hill, where the village proprietors lived, and a few Cham\u00e1rs and Lodh\u00e1s huts at the base. On the administrative head-quarters of the District being fixed here, there was a large influx of officials and people connected with the Courts, and Bulandshahr soon became a fairly thriving and well-to-do little town. The dispensary (built in 1867), and the Anglo-vernacular school with its boarding-house attached, are at the west end of the lower or new town, which there joins immediately on to the Civil Station, containing the Court-houses of the Magistrate-Collector, *munsif's* Court, a public building called the Lowe Memorial in memory of a late Collector, jail, post-office, mission school of the Church of England, canal offices, etc. The tahs\u00edl buildings, including the tahs\u00edl school, are on the top of the\nhill, the approach to the latter being by a fine broad staircase from the bazar below. Most of the local gentry have substantial houses in the town which they occupy as occasional residences. A handsome bathing gh\u00e1t on the river bank was completed in 1880 at a cost of \u00a31600, raised by public subscription. In connection with the gh\u00e1t is a marketplace, in which the lower storey of the double row of shops serves as a massive embankment against a river flood, and its cost amounted to little less than \u00a310,000. A town hall has also been erected at a cost of \u00a32200, defrayed by one of the District gentry. Probably no town in India has undergone so complete a transformation in a few years. In 1878, it was a village of mud-walls and thatched roofs; it is now (1883) a town of brick and carved stone houses.\n\nBulcherry.\u2014Island on the sea-face of the Sundarbans, Bengal.\u2014See Balchari.\n\nBuld\u00e1na.\u2014District of Ber\u00e1r, in the West Ber\u00e1r Division, lying between 19\u00b0 51' and 21\u00b0 1' 30\" N. lat., and 75\u00b0 58' 45\" and 76\u00b0 52' 45\" E. long. Extreme length from north to south, about 80 miles; average width, 32 miles. Bounded on the north by the river P\u00farna, on the south by the Niz\u00e1m's Dominions, on the east by Akola and B\u00e1sim Districts (Ber\u00e1r), on the west by the Niz\u00e1m's Dominions and Khandesh District of the Bombay Presidency. Area, 2804 square miles, of which 2166 square miles were returned in 1880-81 as cultivated, 198 square miles as cultivable, and 440 square miles as uncultivable waste. Population in 1881, 439,763, or 156\u00b78 per square mile of area. Number of villages on the Government rent-roll, 1010. Land revenue, 1880-81, \u00a394,798; total revenue (gross) \u00a3115,194. For fiscal purposes the District is sub-divided into 3 taluks, viz. Chikhl\u00ed, Malkapur, and Mehh\u00e1r.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The southern part of the District forms part of Ber\u00e1r B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t, or Ber\u00e1r-above-the-Gh\u00e1ts. Here the general contour of the country may be described as a succession of small plateaux decreasing in elevation to the extreme south. Towards the eastern side of the District, the country assumes more the character of undulating high lands, favoured with soil of a high quality. The geological formation is trap; a succession of plateaux descends from the highest ridges on the north to the south, where a series of small gh\u00e1ts march with the Niz\u00e1m's territory. The small fertile valleys between the plateaux are watered by streams during the greater portion of the year, while wells of particularly good and pure water are numerous. These valleys are favourite village sites. The north portion of the District occupies the rich valley of the P\u00farna.\n\nThe soil of the undulating highlands in the east of the District is remarkably fine, and the wheat grown here will bear comparison with any produced in India. The principal river is the Penganga, which\nrises about 4 miles above Deulgh\u00e1t (Dewalgh\u00e1t), in the north-west corner of the District, and flows south-east, passing Mehkar town, into B\u00e1sim District. The Nalganga, the Viswaganga, and the Ghan rivers, all rising in or close to the B\u00e1lagh\u00e1t, and flowing north into the Purna river, are either entirely dry in the hot weather, or leave only chains of pools. The Kata Purna enters the District from the west, and after a course of about 30 miles, passes into the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s territory. None of these rivers are navigable. One of the most remarkable physical features of the District is the lake of Lonar, on the most southerly plateau. The circumference of this lake is 5 miles, and it appears to be the crater of an extinct volcano. The salts which it yields are used for washing and drying chintzes, for which purpose they are exported to considerable distances. A temple on its bank is held in great veneration, and is by far the finest specimen of Hindu architecture in Ber\u00e1r.\n\nThe area of reserved forest in the District in 1881-82 was 110'2 square miles, and of unreserved forest, 320 square miles. Though in the ravines of the North Gh\u00e1ts, teak saplings exist in great numbers, no large teak trees are found. Anjan trees (Hardwickia binata) are to be found in most of the ravines, and large numbers of babul coppices are scattered about. Many other varieties of fruit and forest trees, some of the latter yielding lac, gums and dyes, flourish throughout the District. Bears, tigers, leopards, hyenas, sambhar, nilgai, and wild hog are met with in the hills, and antelope and spotted deer in the valley of the Purna, which is often visited by wild hog and nilgai; black and grey partridge, quail, and water-fowl are among the smaller game to be obtained, and pea-fowl are found in the hills and on the river banks.\n\nHistory.\u2014The ancient Hemar Panthi temples to be seen at Deulgh\u00e1t on the Penganga, at Mehkar in the south-east of the District, at Sindhker in the south-west, at Pimpalg\u00e1o in the east, and the temple on the Lon\u00e1r Lake, all attest a state of society of which they are the only ascertained records. It is popularly believed that the rulers were Jains when the valley of the Purna fell under Muhammadan domination. In 1294, Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn, who became Emperor of Delhi in the following year, invaded the Deccan, and established his authority over Ellichpur and its dependencies. He and his successors gradually extended their kingdom southwards; local revolts disturbed, but did not weaken it; and since 1318, Ber\u00e1r has been virtually under Muhammadan rule. About 1437, Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn, son of Ahmad Sh\u00e1h B\u00e1hmani, attacked and routed the allied forces of the King of Kh\u00e1ndesh, and the Guj\u00e1r\u00e1t Prince at Rohankher, in the north-west of Buld\u00e1na District; and the site is still shown where, according to tradition, a great battle was fought. After the B\u00e1hmani dynasty came the Im\u00e1d Sh\u00e1h\u00eds, who ruled from Ellichpur. The\nAhmadnagar dynasty followed; and in 1596, Ch\u00e1nd B\u00edb\u00ed, Queen Regent of Ahmadnagar for her son, formally ceded Ber\u00e1r to the Emperor Akbar, who himself visited the Deccan in 1599. His sons, Prince Mur\u00e1d and Prince D\u00e1nya\u00edl, were successively appointed viceroys. Mehkar in Buld\u00e1na District became one of the Sark\u00e1rs (administrative divisions) of the Subahat or Imperial Province of Ber\u00e1r.\n\nAfter the death of Akbar (1605), Malik Ambar, the Abyssinian representative of the Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h\u00ed party at Daulat\u00e1b\u00e1d, recovered great part of Ber\u00e1r, which he held till his death in 1628; but Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n, assisted by the Deshm\u00fakh of Sindkher, Lakj\u00ed J\u00e1d\u00fan R\u00e1o, re-established the imperial authority. The origin of the powerful R\u00e1jput family of J\u00e1d\u00fan, Deshmukhs of Sindkher, is uncertain, though they are locally reputed to have come from Karw\u00e1l\u00ed in north Hindust\u00e1n on the Jumna. In 1630, Lakj\u00ed J\u00e1d\u00fan R\u00e1o, a commander of 10,000 horse in Malik Ambar\u2019s time, deserted to Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n, and turned the fate of the war against his former master. Thereafter the J\u00e1d\u00fans maintained their allegiance to the Mughal emperors, and obtained honours and titles from them. A daughter of this Lakj\u00ed J\u00e1d\u00fan was the mother of Sivaji, the founder of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 power. During the reign of Aurangzeb, about 1671, the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, under Prat\u00e1p R\u00e1o, Sivaji\u2019s general, first exacted chauth, or one-fourth of the revenue. In 1717, they obtained the formal grant of chauth and sardesh mukhi from the Emperor Farukhsiyar. In 1724, Chin Khil\u00edch Kh\u00e1n, Viceroy of the Deccan under the title of Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk, gained a decisive victory over the Imperial forces under Muh\u00e1riz Kh\u00e1n, at Shakar Khedla (thenceforward called Fatekhedla, or \u2018the field of victory\u2019), south of the Pengang\u00e1 in Buld\u00e1na District. But he could not shake off the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, who continued to collect revenue for themselves.\n\nIn 1760, Mehkar was formally ceded to the Peshw\u00e1; in 1769, the Niz\u00e1m was forced to acknowledge himself Vicegerent for the Poona State, and his authority was weakened by the disastrous defeat at Kardla in 1795. Daulat R\u00e1o Sindhi\u00e1, and the Bhonsl\u00e1 of N\u00e1gpur, were encamped at Malk\u00e1pur, when they allowed the British Envoy, Colonel Collins, to depart in August 1803. Then followed the First Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 war,\u2014Assaye, Argaum (Arg\u00e1on), and other victories scarcely less important\u2014which before the close of the year crushed the supremacy of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. By the partition treaty of 1804, the Niz\u00e1m received nearly the whole of Ber\u00e1r. General Wellesley, January 1804, mentions Sindhker as a nest of thieves, and represents the condition of the country as deplorable. In 1813, two Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 plundering chiefs occupied Fatekhedla for three months. After the Pind\u00e1ri war of 1817\u201318, the treaty of 1822 conferred on the Niz\u00e1m the country west of the Wardha, and all claims by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s were extinguished; but general confusion long continued, and petty battles between zam\u00edn\u00e9d\u00e1rs, rival t\u00e1lukd\u00e1rs, R\u00e1jputs, and Muhammadans, took place at Malk\u00e1pur,\nwhich was sacked by the Hindus in 1849. A force of Arabs in the service of B\u00e1ji R\u00e1o, then head of the J\u00e1d\u00fan family above mentioned, fought a severe battle with the Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d troops in 1851, for which act of rebellion, though disowned by B\u00e1ji R\u00e1o, his hereditary estates were confiscated, and he himself died a state prisoner in 1856. For several years, the Niz\u00e1m's Government had failed to provide funds for the payment of the force maintained by the British, in accordance with the treaty of 1800. The settlement of these arrears and of other points in dispute was effected by the treaty of 1853, modified in 1860-61, whereby the territory now known as Ber\u00e1r was assigned to the British.\n\n**Population.**\u2014The Census of 1867 showed a population of 365,779 persons on an area of 2794 square miles, being 131 per square mile. According to the Administration Report of 1876-77, the population was 404,042, on an area of 2807 square miles; the Census of 1881 returned a total population of 439,763 on an area of 2804 square miles, or 156.8 persons per square mile, thus divided:\u2014Adult males, 141,704; adult females, 132,933; male children under 12 years, 83,539; female children under 12 years, 82,487; total males, 225,243; total females, 214,520. According to religion, Hindus number 405,685; Muhammadans, 30,055; Buddhists and Jains, 3698; Christians, 150; Sikhs, 150; and P\u00e1rs\u00eds, 25. Among Hindus, the number of Br\u00e1hmans in 1881 was 10,734; of Kumb\u00eds, 177,429; of M\u00e1l\u00eds, 28,897; of R\u00e1jputs, 12,018; of Mahars, 47,629; of Baniy\u00e1s, 10,259; and of other Hindu castes, 117,953. The non-Hindu or aboriginal castes or tribes numbered 4464. Among Muhammadans, Sayads numbered 1802; Mughals, 438; Path\u00e1ns, 6095; Shaikhs, 20,526; others, 1194. The agricultural population was returned at 278,174; the non-agricultural at 161,589.\n\nThe principal towns in the District are\u2014Deulgaon Raja (population 7025), Malkapur (8152), Nandura (6743), Chikhli (4396), Dhonegaon (4259), Buldana (2975), Deulghat (3867), Mehk\u00e1r (4373), Fatehkh\u00e9dla (3250).\n\n**Agriculture.**\u2014The District is rich in agricultural produce; in a seasonable year, a many-coloured sheet of cultivation, almost without a break, covers the valley of the P\u00farna. In the B\u00e1lagh\u00e1t also the crops are very fine. Situated as the District is, in the neighbourhood of the great cotton mart of Kh\u00e1mg\u00e1on\u2014only a mile and a half beyond its north-eastern border\u2014and nearer to Bombay than the other Ber\u00e1r Districts, with 3 stations of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway in its northern taluk, markets for its agricultural produce on favourable terms are easily found. The r\u00e1yat commences preparation of his fields in January; for the surface ploughing must be finished before the intense heat has caked the soil. Sowings for the khar\u00edf crop are begun with the first rain in\nJune, and the harvest is gathered in November; the *rabi* crops, sown after the rains, ripen early in March. At this time, the want of labour is much felt, for an unseasonably heavy fall of rain may almost entirely destroy the crops, if not quickly harvested. Rotation of crops is practised; the principle being, that either wheat or gram, or some oil-seed, should intervene between each crop of cotton or *jo\u00e1r*. When the soil is clearly exhausted, it is allowed to lie fallow for a year or two, being manured if manure be obtainable. Deep ploughing is not practised, except to eradicate weeds; for the impression exists, that to thoroughly loosen the soil to any depth is injurious. Sugar-cane is planted in January, and matures in twelve months. For the poppy, land is prepared in September, and sown in October. Guavas and plantains are carefully cultivated, and yams, sweet potatoes, watermelons, and ordinary vegetables flourish in irrigated gardens. Grants-in-aid, to the amount of \u00a3376, were made to 22 villages in 1881\u201382, towards water storage. Applications for such grants are now more frequent than was formerly the case, but most of the cultivation is still unirrigated. The irrigated area in 1880\u201381 was returned at 13,920 acres, grazing land at 79,819 acres. The cattle of the District are small, but handsome and active. Full-sized horses are scarce. The agricultural stock of the District in 1880\u201381 comprised 248,911 cows and bullocks; 60,984 buffaloes; 2028 horses; 4905 ponies; 2602 donkeys; 75,792 sheep and goats; 532 pigs; 14,424 carts; and 22,539 ploughs.\n\nThe system of land tenure is *r\u00e1yatw\u00e1ri*. Under native rule, occupancy and payment of revenue were the only titles to land. With the introduction of the Bombay system of survey and settlement, the cultivating revenue-payer has become a proprietor, styled *kh\u00fatad\u00e1r*, holding from Government as superior landlord, at a fixed assessment for 30 years\u2014not liable to enhancement on expiry of term, unless on good ground shown. The *kh\u00fatad\u00e1r* can sell or mortgage his rights, and also sublet; and he can, if he likes, relinquish his holding at the close of any agricultural year on giving due notice of his intention. The land is often worked by various forms of co-operation, one of which provides a subtenant with plough-cattle.\n\nIn 1880\u201381, 1,386,192 acres were assessed and under cultivation\u2014the chief crops being *jo\u00e1r*, 399,644; cotton, 267,269; wheat, 183,380; *hijri*, 116,184; gram, 62,414; linseed, 28,161; sugar-cane, 2871; *til*, 13,416; *tur*, 10,354; rice, 9244; pulses, 1498; hemp, 1054; *kurdi*, 44,987; tobacco, 2274; lac, 9374; other products, 54,759. The rent rates per acre are\u2014for land fit for cotton, 1s. 5\u00bdd.; wheat, 1s. 10\u00bdd.; oil-seeds, 1s. 7d.; *jo\u00e1r*, 1s. 6\u00bed.; tobacco, 2s. 3d.; opium, 5s.; rice, 2s. 4d.; gram, 2s. 3d. The average produce of land per acre in lbs. are, of cotton (cleaned), 70 lbs.; of wheat, 606; of oil-seeds, 110; of *jo\u00e1r*, 254; of tobacco, 230; of rice, 220; of gram, 376. The prices\n(1880-81) were\u2014for clean cotton, 5 lbs. per rupee (2s.) ; for wheat, 40 lbs. per rupee; for gram, 42 lbs. per rupee; for oil-seeds, 38 lbs. per rupee; for tobacco, 8 lbs. per rupee; for rice, 22 lbs. per rupee; for jo\u00e1r, 82 lbs. per rupee. Plough-bullocks cost \u00a33, 6s. each; buffaloes, \u00a34; sheep, 4s. 6d. to 5s. each. The rate of wages for skilled labour is 1s. 3d. a day; for unskilled labour, 4d.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014Famines have not unfrequently visited the tract of which Buld\u00e1na District forms part. In 1803, a great famine occurred, from which Mehkar suffered very severely. Drought and blight affect the crops, and unseasonable rain when the spring crops are standing is sometimes very injurious.\n\nManufactures and Trade.\u2014Coarse cotton cloth is commonly woven. Before the introduction of Manchester piece-goods and the high price of cotton, Mehkar was famous for its dhot\u00eds, or body cloths. In 1880-81, the number of workers in silk was returned at 82; in cotton, 2779; in wool, 427; in wood, 845; in iron, 646; and 133 in brass and copper; miscellaneous, 913. Steel of fair quality is forged at Deulgh\u00e1t. Weekly markets, some of them very large, are held in several towns and villages. The chief imports are\u2014piece-goods, hardware, metals, spices, salt; exports\u2014cotton, wheat, oil-seeds, and cattle. The District is rich in wheat, and its chief market for this staple is N\u00e1nd\u00fara, a station of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway. The principal fairs and b\u00e1z\u00e1srs are held at Deulg\u00e1on R\u00e1j\u00e1, Mehkar, Fatekhedla, Chikhli, Dong\u00e1on, Selg\u00e1on, Mhusla, Janephal, Lon\u00e1r, Deulgh\u00e1t, N\u00e1nd\u00fara, and Malk\u00e1pur.\n\nRoads and Railways.\u2014There are in Buld\u00e1na 259 miles of made roads, first, second, and third class. The G. I. P. Railway passes through the north portion of the District, from west to east, for 29 miles, having stations at Malk\u00e1pur, Biswa Bridge, and N\u00e1nd\u00fara. There are ser\u00e1\u00eds or rest-houses for native travellers at these stations, and rest-houses for Europeans at Malk\u00e1pur and N\u00e1nd\u00fara.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The District is administered by a Deputy Commissioner, with whom are associated Assistants, European and native. An Assistant Commissioner holds his court at Malk\u00e1pur. There are 3 revenue sub-divisions. The police are under the control of a European District Superintendent; the sanctioned strength of the force in 1880-81 was 75 officers and 374 men, or 1 policeman to every 6 square miles of area. There is one receiving jail; total daily average of inmates in 1881, 55'61. Cost per head yearly, \u00a38, 7s. 6d. on average strength. The proportion of Muhammadan convicts to Muhammadans in the District is more than double that of any other class\u2014a fact which may be attributable to their forming a larger proportionate number of the town population. The number of schools aided and inspected by Government, and of Government schools (including 3 girls\u2019 schools),\nin the same year was 122, having 5546 scholars. The Central Book Depot of the Province supplies works in Mar\u00e1th\u00ed, English, Sanskrit, Persian, and Urd\u00fa. The vernacular tongues are Mar\u00e1th\u00ed and Urd\u00fa. No newspaper is printed in the District; and no municipality under Act iv. of 1873 has yet been constituted.\n\nMeteorological and Medical Aspects.\u2014In the north portion of the District, strong and very hot westerly winds prevail from the middle of February till rain falls early in June, and, excepting just about daybreak, they continue throughout the twenty-four hours. In the rainy season, and from October to February, the mornings and nights are pleasantly cool, but the heat in the day is still great. In the B\u00e1lagh\u00e1t or south portion of the District, the hot weather is not excessive; the temperature of the rainy season is pleasant; and the cold weather of about three months is most enjoyable, but the great dryness of the air at that time is trying to some constitutions. Highest shade temperature at Buld\u00e1na in May (1880), 106\u00b0 F.; lowest in December, 54\u00b0. The rainfall in 1880 was 29\u00b717 inches, of which 25\u00b714 inches fell from June to September. The principal diseases are fevers, bowel complaints, worms, and affections of the skin and eyes. The number of deaths registered in 1880 from all causes was 8855, of which number 22 were killed by snake-bite and wild animals. Ratio of reported deaths per 1000 of population, 20\u00b71. The number of births registered in 1880 was 15,455; ratio per 1000 of population, 35\u00b71. In 1880\u201381, 7 dispensaries and 1 civil hospital afforded medical relief to 24,279 patients; and the number of persons vaccinated by the vaccine department, and at the dispensaries, was 13,356.

Also the Census Reports of 1881; and the Administration Reports for the Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d Assigned Districts from 1880 to 1883.]\n\nBuls\u00e1r.\u2014Sub-division of Surat District, Bombay Presidency. Area, 208 square miles. One town and 94 villages; occupied houses, 16,214. Population (1881) 80,707, namely, Hindus, 57,887; Muhammadans, 3784; \u2018others,\u2019 19,836. Land revenue (1874\u201375), \u00a324,346. There are no alienated villages in this Sub-division. The whole surface is irregular, seamed with river beds, and rising into rocky uplands. Situated on the sea-coast, the climate is considered healthy at all times of the year, but the eastern parts are feverish at certain seasons. Tith\u00e1l, a village on the coast, is much resorted to as a sanitarium by visitors from Bombay. The Sub-division is abundantly watered by rivers and streams. Of the salt marsh lands, extending over about 12,355 acres, 10,664 acres are under reclamation. The rates of assessment introduced in 1869\u201370 remain in force until 1898\u201399. The Sub-division contains 1 civil and 2 criminal courts; strength of regular police, 37 men; village watchmen (chaukiddrs), 523.\nBuls\u00e1r (Bals\u00e1r, Wals\u00e1d, Vals\u00e1d).\u2014Port and town in Surat District, Bombay Presidency; situated in lat. 20\u00b0 36' 30\" N., long. 72\u00b0 58' 40\" E., about 40 miles south of Surat and 115 north of Bombay, on the estuary of the navigable though small river Auranga; station on the railway between Surat and Bombay. Population (1881) 13,229, of whom 8927 are Hindus, 2454 Musalm\u00e1ns, 870 P\u00e1ris, 219 Jains, and 48 Christians. Of the Musalm\u00e1ns, the greater number are T\u00e1\u00eds, or converted Hind\u00fas; they are engaged chiefly in cloth-weaving, and are as a rule well-to-do. Municipal income in 1880-81, \u00a31220, or 2s. 1\u00bdd. per head of the total population; municipal expenditure in the same year, \u00a31154. Buls\u00e1r is well placed for trade both by sea and by land. The total value of its coast trade, exclusive of Government stores, in 1880-81 was \u00a383,810, of which \u00a361,859 represented the value of exports, and \u00a322,196 that of imports. Chief imports\u2014piece-goods, tobacco, wheat, fish, and sugar; exports\u2014timber, grain, molasses, oil, firewood, and tiles. Export of timber is the staple of Buls\u00e1r trade. The wood brought from the D\u00e1ng forests is exported by sea to Dholera, Bhaunagar, and the other ports of K\u00e1thi\u00e1war. There are manufactures of cloth for wearing apparel and for sails, silks for women\u2019s robes, and bricks, tiles, and pottery. Besides the ordinary sub-divisional revenue and police offices, the town has a subordinate judge\u2019s court, post-office, and dispensary.\n\nBulti (B\u00e1ltist\u00e1n or Iskardo).\u2014The name given to the tract of country forming the northern part of Kashmir (Cashmere), and lying between lat. 34\u00b0 and 36\u00b0 N., and between long. 75\u00b0 and 79\u00b0 E. Formerly an independent State, but it was some years ago subjugated by the Mahar\u00e1j\u00e1 of Kashm\u00edr, who annexed it to his own dominions.\n\nBul-Tul (or Kant\u00e1l; also called Shur-j\u00ed-la).\u2014A pass over the range of mountains bounding the Kashmir valley on the north-east. Lat. 34\u00b0 14' N., long. 75\u00b0 33' E. Forms the water-summit between Kashmir (Cashmere) and Little Tibet; the Dr\u00e1s river (by which name the pass is also sometimes known) flowing from its northern declivity to the Indus, while from its southern slopes runs a feeder of the Sind river, a tributary of the Jhelum (Jehlam) river; elevation above sea-level, 11,300 feet.\n\nB\u00famawad\u00ed (Bhoomaividee).\u2014Township in Taung-ng\u00fa District, Tenasserim Division, British Burma; situated on the left bank of the Sittaung river, and extending north from Shwe-gyin District to the river Thit-nan-tha. The country is level and cultivated along the river bank; but in the interior to the east it is mountainous, and covered with forests of teak and other valuable timber. The chief lakes are Inwon and Zindon, both in the south-west of the township. Population (1881) 13,182. Gross revenue (1881) \u00a32092, of which \u00a3581 was land revenue, and \u00a3893 capitation tax.\nBund.\u2014Town in D\u00e1dri tahsil, Jind State, Punjab. Population (1881) 3884, namely, Hindus, 3569; and Muhammadans, 315; number of occupied houses, 674.\n\nBund\u00e1l\u00e1.\u2014Town in Amritsar tahsil, Amritsar District, Punjab. Lat. 31\u00b0 32' N., long. 75\u00b0 1' 30\" E.; population (1881) 5101, namely, 2192 Sikhs, 1408 Muhammadans, and 1501 Hindus; number of occupied houses, 509. Distant from Amritsar city, 9 miles south-east. Of little commercial importance; chiefly noticeable for its large Sikh population.\n\nBund\u00e1re.\u2014Village in Vizagapatam District, Madras Presidency. This is one of the chief Kandh villages, and was formerly a stronghold of the practice of human sacrifice known as Meriah or Junna. The ceremony, as performed at Bund\u00e1re up to 1849, consisted in the sacrifice of three human beings,\u2014two to the sun, in the east and west of the village, and one in the centre. A short wooden post having been fixed in the ground, the victim was fastened to it by his long hair, and held out by his legs and arms over a grave dug at the foot of the post. While in this position, the priest hacked the back of the victim's neck with the sacrificial knife, repeating as he did so the following invocation:\u2014'O mighty Maniksoro, this is your festal day! The sacrifice we now offer, you must eat; and we pray that our battle-axes may be converted into swords, our bows and arrows into gunpowder and bullets; and if we have any quarrels with other tribes, give us the victory. Preserve us from the tyranny of kings and their officers.' Then addressing the victim: 'That we may enjoy prosperity, we offer you as a sacrifice to our god Maniksoro, who will immediately eat you; so be not grieved at our slaying you. Your parents were aware, when we purchased you from them for 60 rupees, that we did so with intent to sacrifice you; there is therefore no sin on our heads, but on your parents. After you are dead we shall perform your obsequies.' The victim was then decapitated, the body thrown into the grave, and the head left suspended from the post till devoured by birds. The knife remained fixed to the post till all three sacrifices were performed, when it was removed with much ceremony.\n\nBundelkhand.\u2014Tract of country in Upper India, which may be defined as lying between the river Jumna (Jamun\u00e1) on the north, the Chambal on the north and west, the Jabalpur (Jubbulpore) and S\u00e1g\u00e1r (Saugor) Divisions of the Central Provinces on the south, and Rew\u00e1 or B\u00e1ghelkhand and the Mirz\u00e1pur Hills on the south and east. Its limits stretch from 23\u00b0 52' to 26\u00b0 26' N. lat., and from 77\u00b0 53' to 81\u00b0 39' E. long. It comprises the British Districts of Hamirpur, J\u00e1lau\u00f1, Jh\u00e1nsi, L\u00e1l\u00edtpur, and B\u00e1n\u00e1; the treaty States of Orchha (or Tehri), Datia, and Samthar; and the following States held under sanads and grants from the British Government:\u2014Ajaigarh, Alipura; the Hashtbh\u00e1ya J\u00e1girs of Dhurw\u00e1i,\nBijna, Tori-Fatehpur, and Pah\u00e1ri B\u00e1nka; Baraunda, B\u00e1oni, Beri, Bihat, Bij\u00e1war, Charkh\u00e1ri; the K\u00e1l\u00ednjar Chaub\u00eds, viz. Paldeo, Pahra, Tar\u00e1on, Bh\u00e1isaunda, and K\u00e1mta-Rajaula; Chhattarpur, Garrauli, Gaurihar, J\u00e1s\u00f3, Jign\u00ed, Khani\u00e1dh\u00e1na, Lugh\u00e1si, Naigaw\u00e1n, Rib\u00e1i, Panna, Belhari, and Sarila,\u2014all of which see separately.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The plains of Bundelkhand are diversified by a series of mountains and hills, classed by Franklin, in his Memoir on the Geology of Bundelkhand, in three ranges\u2014the Bind\u00e1chal, the Panna, and the Bandair. The first of these, which nowhere exceeds 2000 feet above sea-level, commences near Sihonda on the river Sindh, proceeds southwest to Narw\u00e1r, thence south-east and afterwards north-west to Ajaigarh and K\u00e1l\u00ednjar, and farther east to Bardarh near the railway between Jabalpur (Jubbulpore) and Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d. The plateau which lies behind this range averages 10 or 12 miles in width. The base and lower parts of the hills are of primary formation, chiefly granite and syenite, commonly overlaid by sandstone, but in many cases by trap and formations of volcanic origin. The second range, styled the Panna range, rises to the south of the plateau just described. The summit is a table-land, slightly undulating, with a breadth of about 10 miles, and having an average elevation above the sea, between the Katra Pass and Loh\u00e1rg\u00e1on, of 1050 feet, and between Loh\u00e1rg\u00e1on and the foot of the hills near Pathariya, of about 1200 feet. Where deep ravines allow examination of the formation, the primary rocks are found to be covered by an enormously thick bed of sandstone, which is itself in some places overlaid by rocks of volcanic origin. South-west of this last range, and separated from it by the valley or elongated basin of Loh\u00e1rg\u00e1on is the third or Bandair range, the plateau of which has an average elevation of about 1700 feet above the sea, and on some of the undulations as much as 2000. The Bandair range is generally of sandstone mixed with ferruginous gravel. The extensive basin of Loh\u00e1rg\u00e1on intervening between these ranges is of limestone. The limits of the hilly tract where it bounds the plain are marked by the occurrence of abrupt isolated hills, generally of granitic base, surmounted by sandstone and trap, which, from their steep and nearly inaccessible scarps, form, as in the instances of K\u00e1l\u00ednjar and Ajaigarh, strongholds which have often enabled the hillmen of Bundelkhand to set at defiance the great Empires of India. From these hills numerous streams flow towards the Jumna; among which are the Sindh with its tributary the Pah\u00faj, the Betw\u00e1, the Dh\u00e1san, the B\u00edrma, the Ken, the B\u00e1gain, the P\u00e1isuni, and the Tons. All these flow in a general north-easterly direction. The only one of them useful for navigation is the Ken, which, during the rainy season only, is navigable as far as B\u00e1nda, a distance of 60 miles. Notwithstanding the numerous streams which traverse the country, the great depth of the channels in the plains, and the thirsty nature of\nthe soil among the hills, render irrigation highly important; and to supply means for it, a great number of jhils, or small lakes, have been constructed by embanking the lower extremities of valleys.\n\nThe mineral resources of Bundelkhand appear very great. Diamonds are found in Panna, but the yield is small and precarious. In the central tracts there is excellent iron, but at present its production is limited by the supply of charcoal, and even now the jungles in the iron Districts are cleared off faster than they can be renewed. When science has taught how the metal can be extracted with sufficient economy of fuel, Bundelkhand iron and steel will doubtless find a market far beyond the present limits of Gwalior, H\u00e1thras, Lucknow, and Cawnpur. A small copper mine has been recently worked in L\u00e1litpur.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The British Districts of Bundelkhand are within the jurisdiction of the Lieutenant-Governor of the North-Western Provinces. The political superintendence of the Native States is vested in the Bundelkhand Agency, subordinate to the Central India Agency, reporting to the Government of India. Of the 31 Native States within the Agency, only three, namely, Orchha or Tehri, Datia, and Samthar, have formal treaties with the British Government. The other chiefs hold their territories under sanads, and are bound by ikrarn\u00e1m\u00e1s, or deeds of fealty and obedience. The table on the opposite page exhibits in brief the area and population of each District and State, but fuller details will be found in the separate articles.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Except where hill or jungle predominate, as in several of the Native States, the Province is almost solely agricultural. Much of the soil in the Native States is very poor, being chiefly on the hill ranges mentioned above; but the soil of the plains consists mostly of the 'black cotton soil,' which, notwithstanding its dried appearance in hot weather, has the peculiar property of retaining moisture to a marked degree, and yields in favourable seasons luxuriant crops of cotton and cereals. The principal crops are\u2014al (Morinda citrifolia), which yields the dye used in colouring the reddish-brown cloths known as kharu\u00e1; jo\u00e1r (Sorghum vulgare), h\u00e1gj\u00e1 (Penicillaria spicata); til (Sesamum orientale); and the millets and pulses known as kangni, kutki, s\u00e1m\u00e1n, arhar, moth, m\u00e1sh, mas\u00far\u00ed, khesari, etc. The singh\u00e1ra, or water-caltrop, is largely grown in Ham\u00edrpur; and throughout Bundelkhand, the mahu\u00e1 tree (Bassia latifolia) is cultivated for its flowers and fruit as well as for its timber.\n\nIn Orchha, and throughout the greater part of the whole country, the prevailing plan of land settlement is the native system\u2014under which the State, while recognising in every village a head-man with certain advantages, yet keeps the property of the soil in its own hands, acts as\n\n[Sentence continued on p. 154.]\n## Area, Population, etc. of Each District and State in Bundelkhand, in 1881.\n\n### British Districts\n\n|

The railway from Jabalpur to Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d now creates a demand for various local products for about 100 miles from the line, and through its means, connections with the Bombay trade are springing up; when the connecting country roads are completed, much improvement may be expected. The climate in the plains is frequently sultry, and the heat is great. The prevailing wind from October to May is south-west, that is, up the Gangetic valley; during the other months the wind frequently comes down the valley.\n\nAt Nowgong a British garrison is stationed, consisting of 1 battery of artillery, 2 companies of British infantry, 3 troops of Native cavalry, and the head-quarters and wing of a Native infantry regiment. The Bundelkhand R\u00e1jk\u00famar College is established near Nowgong for the education of the sons of chiefs; in 1881, seventeen youths of noble family were being educated there.\n\nHistori.\u2014According to local tradition, the Gonds were the earliest colonists of Bundelkhand. To them succeeded the Chandel R\u00e1jputs, under whose supremacy the great irrigation works of Ham\u00edrpur District, the forts of K\u00e1l\u00ednjar and Ajaigarh, and the noble temples of Kha-jur\u00e1hu and M\u00e1hoba, were constructed. The whole Province contains ruins, large tanks, and magnificent temples, built chiefly of hewn granite and carved sandstone, which are supposed to date back to this epoch. Ferishta relates that in the year 1021 A.D., the Chandel R\u00e1j\u00e1 marched at the head of 36,000 horse, 45,000 foot, and 640 elephants, to oppose Mahm\u00fad of Ghazn\u00ed, whom, however, he was obliged to conciliate with rich presents. In the year 1183, Parmal Deo, the twentieth ruler in succession from Chandra Varma, the founder of the dynasty, was defeated by Prithwi R\u00e1j\u00e1, ruler of Ajmere and Delhi. After the overthrow of Parmal Deo, the country was exposed to anarchy and to Muhammadan invasions until the close of the 14th century, when the Bundelas, a sub-division of the Garhwa tribe of R\u00e1jputs, established themselves on the right bank of the Jumna. They appear to have settled first at Mau, and then, after taking K\u00e1l\u00ednjar and K\u00e1lpi, to have made M\u00e1honi their capital. About 1531, R\u00e1j\u00e1 Rudra Prat\u00e1p founded the city of Orchha, and greatly consolidated and extended the kingdom. The Bundelas became the most powerful among the tribes west of the Jumna; and from this time the name of Bundelkhand may with justice be given to the whole tract of country. Shortly afterwards, the power of the Muhammadans began to grow threatening; and Bir Singh Deo, the great-grandson of the founder of Orchha, was compelled to acknowledge himself a vassal of the Mughal Empire. Champat R\u00e1i, however, another chief of the Bundela tribe, held out in the rugged countries\nbordering on the Betwa, and harassed the Mulammadans by his rapid predatory forays.\n\nThe son of Champat R\u00e1\u00ed, Chattar S\u00e1l, continued his father's career with greater eventual success; and, being elected principal leader and chief of the Bundelas, commenced operations by the reduction of the forts in the hills towards Panna. He wasted the country held by his enemies in every direction, and avoiding a general action, managed by ambuscades, aided by his intimate knowledge of the country, to cut off or elude the imperial troops. He captured K\u00e1l\u00ednjar, and, making that his stronghold, acquired authority over territory yielding nearly a million sterling per annum. In 1734, however, he was so hard pressed by Ahmad Kh\u00e1n Bangash, the Path\u00e1n chief of Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d, that he was forced to seek aid from the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. The Peshw\u00e1, B\u00e1ji R\u00e1o, promptly embraced this opportunity of establishing his ascendancy in Bundelkhand; he surprised and defeated Ahmad Kh\u00e1n, and rescued the Bundela R\u00e1j\u00e1 from his perilous position. He was rewarded by a fort and District in the neighbourhood of Jh\u00e1nsi, and by a grant of the third part of Eastern Bundelkhand. The Peshw\u00e1 made over his portion, subject to a moderate tribute, to a Br\u00e1hman called K\u00e1si Pandit, whose descendants held it until it lapsed to the East India Company. About the same time, Jh\u00e1nsi was wrested by the Peshw\u00e1 from the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Orchha, and entrusted to a sub\u00e1hd\u00e1r, whose descendants retained it till a recent date. The two remaining shares of the possessions of Chattar S\u00e1l continued to be held in small portions by his numerous descendants, or by the nominal adherents and rebellious servants of the declining branches of the family.\n\nThe anarchy and petty wars thus ensuing made an opening for Ali Bah\u00e1dur (a grandson of B\u00e1ji R\u00e1o by a Muhammadan concubine), who had quarrelled with Madhuji Sindhi\u00e1, whose troops he had formerly led. After a long and severe contest, he succeeded in establishing his authority over the greater part of the Province. The chief resistance he met with was at K\u00e1l\u00ednjar, at the siege of which place he died in 1802, after having concluded an arrangement with the Court of Poona (P\u00fana), by which the sovereign and paramount right of the Peshw\u00e1 over all his conquests in Bundelkhand was declared and acknowledged. R\u00e1j\u00e1 Himmat Bah\u00e1dur, the spiritual head and military commander of a large body of devotees, who had great influence in the District, professed at first his intention of supporting the right of Shamsher Bah\u00e1dur, the son of Al\u00ed Bah\u00e1dur, who happened to be absent in Poona at the time of his father's death.\n\nAbout this time the declared hostility of the subordinate chiefs of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 Empire to the arrangements of the treaty of Bassein\u2014by which, among other advantages, the British Government acquired territory in Bundelkhand yielding \u00a3361,600 a year\u2014occasioned a formal declaration\non the part of the British Government of their intention of maintaining the provisions of that treaty; and this declaration was immediately followed by offensive operations on the part of Sindhi\u00e1 and the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Ber\u00e1r, and equally hostile, though more secret, measures of aggression on the part of Holkar. Part of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 plan of operations was a predatory incursion into British territory from Bundelkhand, to be headed by Shamsher Bah\u00e1d\u00far. R\u00e1j\u00e1 Himmat Bah\u00e1d\u00far, foreseeing in the success of this scheme a diminution of his own authority in Bundelkhand, determined to abandon the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 interest, and to seek his own personal aggrandizement by assisting in the transfer of the Province to the British. An agreement was consequently made, by which the R\u00e1j\u00e1 was granted a tract of territory yielding 20 l\u00e1khs of rupees (say \u00a3200,000) for the maintenance of a body of troops in the service of the British Government, as well as a j\u00e1g\u00edr in consideration of his co-operation in the establishment of British authority in Bundelkhand. The British Government were thus enabled easily to bring a force into Bundelkhand for the decision of the contest, while Himmat Bah\u00e1d\u00far received territory more than double the area of his original possessions. These lands were resumed on his death, and j\u00e1g\u00edrs and pensions assigned to his family. Shamsher Bah\u00e1d\u00far was quickly defeated by a force under Col. Powell, assisted by the troops of Himmat Bah\u00e1d\u00far; and he was content to accept a provision of 4 l\u00e1khs of rupees (say \u00a340,000) a year from the British Government, with permission to reside at B\u00e1nda. On his death in 1823, he was succeeded by his brother Zulfik\u00e1r Al\u00ed.\n\nTo him succeeded Al\u00ed Bah\u00e1d\u00far, who joined in the rebellion of 1857, and was therefore deprived of the pension of 4 l\u00e1khs a year, and placed under surveillance at Indore. He died in 1873, and pensions amounting to \u00a3120 were assigned to the family. Of the territory ceded by the Peshw\u00e1, the British Government retained in its own possession lands on the banks of the Jumna, yielding about 14 l\u00e1khs of rupees (\u00a3140,000), exclusive of the territory granted to Himmat Bah\u00e1d\u00far. On the extinction of the Peshw\u00e1's independence in 1818, all his sovereign rights in Bundelkhand finally passed to the British. Of the Bundelkhand States, J\u00e1laun, Jh\u00e1nsi, J\u00e1itpur, and Khaddi have lapsed to the Government; and Chirg\u00e1o\u0144 (one of the Hashtgarhi j\u00e1g\u00edrs), Purwa, one of the K\u00e1l\u00ednjar Chaubis (or shares held in the K\u00e1l\u00ednjar district by representatives of the Chaubi family), Eijer\u00e1ghogarh, and Tiroha have been confiscated. The States of Sh\u00e1hgarh and B\u00e1npur were also confiscated on account of the rebellion of the chiefs in 1857. B\u00e1npur was claimed by Sindhi\u00e1 as forming part of the Chanderi district conquered by the Gwalior Darb\u00e1r in 1831. The claim was not admitted, but the B\u00e1npur territory has been made over to Sindhi\u00e1 under arrangements connected with the treaty of 1860. [For further information regarding Bundelkhand, see the Gazetteer of the North-Western\nBundi (Boond\u00e9e).\u2014Native State of Rajputana, under the political superintendence of the Haraoti and Tonk Agency, subordinate to the Agent to the Governor-General of India for the States of Rajputana. The State lies between $24^\\circ 59' 50''$ and $25^\\circ 59' 30''$ N. latitude, and $75^\\circ 18'$ and $76^\\circ 21' 35''$ E. longitude, and is bounded on the north by the States of Jaipur and Tonk, on the east and south by Kotah, and on the west by Udaipur (Oodeypore). Area, 2300 square miles. Length 70 miles, and breadth about 43 miles. Population in 1881, 254,701, or 110.8 per square mile. Revenue, \u00a360,000.\n\nThe territory of Bundi may be roughly described as an irregular rhombus, traversed throughout its whole length from south-west to north-east by a double range of hills, constituting the central Bundi range, dividing the country into two almost equal portions. On the south, the river Chambal forms, for very nearly the whole distance, the natural boundary between Bundi and Kotah. For many miles the precipitous scarp on the southern face of this central range forms an almost impassable barrier between the plain country on either side. In the centre of the range, commanding the pass through which runs the only high road from north to south, lies the chief town of the State, Bundi. The highest elevation of the range is 1793 feet, while the height of the capital is 1426 feet above the sea, and above the lowland below it is about 600 feet. Besides the Bundi pass, the only other gaps through this range are one between Jainwas and Bundi, through which the direct road from Tonk passes; and another between R\u00e1mgarh and Kh\u00e1tgarh, where the Mej river has cut a channel for itself from the northern to the southern side. The northern plain lies exclusively upon a bed of slate, shale, and clay slate; while the southern is rich in alluvial soil. These peculiarities of surface give a totally opposite character to the river-beds of the two basins.\n\nBeyond the northern boundary of Bundi proper, are several outlying portions of territory belonging to the State. The largest is that of which Garh is the chief town. Large tracts of the State are woodland, consisting chiefly of sal, from which a gum exudes which is bartered, weight for weight, against flour, by the Bhils and others. A fine tree growing near streams is the mulkarai, which attains a great height, perfectly straight throughout, with a diameter of from 12 to 15 inches, prettily grained, and well adapted for neat furniture.\n\nAlmost the only drainage channel of Bundi is the Mej river, which rises in the Meywar territory at an elevation of about 1700 feet above sea-level. It enters the State near the village of Nagar, and after a course of 92 miles within it, falls into the Chambal. The Mej\nirrigates both the northern and southern basins; its chief tributary in the former is the B\u00e1j\u00e1w\u00e1s, or Baj\u00e1en; in the latter, the Kur\u00e1l. The length of the Baj\u00e1en is about 35 miles. The Kur\u00e1l, lying for its whole length in the rich alluvial soil of south-eastern B\u00fandi, has numerous villages along its banks. There are no natural lakes in B\u00fandi; the two largest sheets of water, artificially enclosed, are at Dug\u00e1ri and Hindoli. The history of the B\u00fandi State is the history, so far as it can be extracted from chronicles and genealogies, of the family of the ruling chief, and of the fortunes of his clan in settling themselves in this part of India. The chiefs belong to the H\u00e1r\u00e1 sept of the great clan of the Chauh\u00e1n R\u00e1jp\u00fats, and the country occupied by them for many centuries is called H\u00e1r\u00e1oti. The first Mah\u00e1r\u00e1o R\u00e1j\u00e1 with whom the British Government had any intercourse was Umed Singh, who gave most efficient assistance to Colonel Monson\u2019s army during his retreat before Holkar in 1804, bringing down on himself the vengeance of Holkar in consequence.\n\nFrom that time up to 1817, the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s and Pind\u00e1r\u00eds constantly ravaged the State, exacting tribute and assuming supremacy. The territory of B\u00fandi was so situated as to be of great importance during the war of 1817, in cutting off the retreat of the Pind\u00e1r\u00eds. The Mah\u00e1r\u00e1o R\u00e1j\u00e1 of the time, Bithir Singh, early accepted the British alliance, and a treaty was concluded with him on the 10th of February 1818. Although his forces were inconsiderable, he co-operated heartily with the British Government; and he was rewarded by a part of P\u00e1tan-Keshorai, Holkar\u2019s rights over this territory being commuted into an annual payment of \u00a33000, made by the British Government to him. In 1844, Sindhi\u00e1 transferred his two-thirds share of P\u00e1tan-Keshorai to the British, as part of the territory ceded in trust for the support of the Gwalior Contingent; and an agreement was made by which it was handed over to B\u00fandi on payment of \u00a38000 a year. The Mah\u00e1r\u00e1o R\u00e1j\u00e1 proving uncertain during the Mutiny of 1857, friendly intercourse with him was broken off, and not resumed till 1860. The position of B\u00fandi is now that of a Protected State, acknowledging the supremacy of the British Government. The chief is absolute ruler in his own territory, pays a tribute of \u00a312,000 to the British Government, and receives a salute of 17 guns. The military force of the State consists of 590 horse, 2282 infantry, 18 field and 70 other guns. The chief bears the title of Mah\u00e1r\u00e1o R\u00e1j\u00e1.\n\nThe Census of 1881 gave a total population for B\u00fandi of 254,701, of whom 133,103 were males and 121,598 females, occupying 60,565 houses in 2 towns and 840 villages, or an average of 4\u00b720 persons in each house. By religion, Hindus numbered 242,107; Muhammadans, 9,477; Jains, 3101; Sikhs, 9; and Christians, 7. According to castes and sects, Br\u00e1hmans were returned at 23,025; R\u00e1jp\u00fats, 9274;\nBaniyas, 15,406; G\u00fajars, 30,377; J\u00e1ts, 2881; Ahirs, 1310; Min\u00e1s, 35,982; Bhils, 6554; Cham\u00e1rs, 19,278; Dh\u00e1kurs, 7103; other Hindu castes, 94,018.\n\nThe total revenue of B\u00fandi State is estimated at \u00a3101,400, of which about \u00a385,000 is derived from the land. The assignments, allotments, and endowments diminish by about \u00a335,000 the land revenue demand of the treasury, leaving the effective income of the State at about \u00a366,400, of which about \u00a36,400 comes from customs. For purposes of administration the State is divided into 10 parg\u00e1ns, viz. Barodia, B\u00e1nsi, Nainwah, Tama\u00eddi, K\u00e1rw\u00e1r, Lakheri, Ganidoli, Keshorai-P\u00e1tan, Loecha, and Sillor. These again are sub-divided into 22 t\u00e1lukds, each presided over by an officer called a t\u00e1lukd\u00e1r, who exercises revenue, criminal, and civil jurisdiction within his limits. There are no police or police stations in the State. Sanitary arrangements are not considered in any of the towns or villages. The chief crops are joi\u00e1r, maize, barley, wheat, and other grains, pulses of various kinds, sugar-cane, oil-seeds, cotton, rice, indigo, tobacco, opium, and betel-leaf. The cultivated area and cultivable land cannot be given exactly, as it varies greatly each year; it may be approximately put down at 1,000,000 acres. Each village has a p\u00e1tel, a chaukid\u00e1r, and a patw\u00e1ri.\n\nThe main road through the State is from Deoli Cantonment, through the Maidak Dara pass, towards Kotah and Jh\u00e1l\u00e1war. The road from Tonk to Deoli, through the Ganesho Ghati pass, crosses the north-eastern corner of the State. Over the rest of the country there are mere tracks, which serve the purpose of local traffic.

Situated in a gorge in the centre of the range of hills passing through the State. Lat. 25\u00b0 27' N., long. 75\u00b0 40' 37\" E. Population (1881) 20,744, namely, Hindus, 16,351; Muhammadans, 4377; 'others,' 16. Next to Udaipur (Oodeypore), the town of B\u00fandi is the most picturesque in R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. Built upon the steep side of the hill, the palace rising up above the city itself in pinnacled terraces, is a striking feature of the place. The streets and houses rise and fall with the unevenness of the ground, and some of the suburbs have crept upwards on both the northern slopes. Below the palace is a large range of stable yards and other offices, above which rise the reception courts and halls of audience; over these again are ranged the more private chambers and receiving rooms of the Court. Higher still rise the crenelated battlements and columned chh\u00e1tris surmounting still more private apartments, and finally a stone causeway leads upwards to the summit of the ridge, where the main fort and the chief's most secluded recesses are situated.\nThe city is entirely enclosed within walled fortifications, through which ingress and egress are obtained by means of four gateways, viz. the Mahal gate on the west, the Ch\u00e1ogan gate on the south, the M\u00edna gate on the east, and the J\u00e1t S\u00e1g\u00e1r gate on the north-east. One tolerably regular street, nearly 50 feet in width, runs throughout the whole length of the city from the palace to the M\u00edna gate. The other streets are all narrow and very irregular. One large temple on the fort hill, another in the southern suburb, 12 Jain temples, and about 415 smaller temples and shrines sacred to Vishnu and Mah\u00e1deo, are scattered about the town. There are four approaches to the fort, a private one from the palace, one from the Gh\u00e1ti gate near the Sukh Mahal, one from Birkhandi, and one from Ph\u00fal-B\u00e1gh. A spur of the fort hill is surmounted by a large and very handsome chhatri called the S\u00faraj, or Sun Dome, whose cupola rests on 16 pillars, and is about 20 feet in diameter; beyond this, to the northward, lies the Ph\u00fal-B\u00e1gh, and to the south again of this, about two miles from the city, the Naya-B\u00e1gh, both private places of retirement for the B\u00fandi chiefs. Immediately to the west of the city rises an abrupt cliff, very nearly as high as that on which the fort stands, surmounted by a small mosque. To the south of the city there are a few scattered remains of former pleasure gardens, with here and there a monumental cenotaph. One large and very handsome one is dedicated to one of the royal foster-brothers of Aj\u00edt Singh\u2019s time. Skirting the northern bank of the J\u00e1t S\u00e1g\u00e1r also are several pleasure-gardens, terminating at the Ser-B\u00e1gh or Mah\u00e1satti, the place of cremation for all the B\u00fandi chiefs. There is a charitable dispensary at B\u00fandi, a mint where gold, silver, and copper pieces are coined, an English school, several indigenous schools, and a post-office.\n\n**Bunera.**\u2014Town in Udaipur (Oodeypore) State, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. Situated about 90 miles from Udaipur town, on the high road from Nimach to Nas\u00edr\u00e1bd, distant 85 miles from the former and 59 from the latter. The R\u00e1ja of Bunera is one of the chief feudatories of Udaipur, and his palace is one of the most imposing-looking edifices in the State. The town contains some 2500 houses; is walled, with a fort on the hill, at an elevation of 1903 feet above sea-level.\n\n**Bunh\u00e1r.**\u2014Hill river in Jhelum (Jehlam) District, Punjab. Receives the whole drainage from the eastern portion of the Dhanni country north of the Salt Range; finds its way through a break in the upper or Diljabba spur, passes on through the Gora Galli Pass between the Tilla and Garjak Hills, and finally empties itself into the Jhelum river, about a mile above D\u00e1rapur. After a heavy fall of rain, the Bunh\u00e1r becomes a roaring torrent, impassable for many hours. Its bed below the Gora Galli stretches upwards of a mile in breadth.\n\n**B\u00fan-maw** (*Bh\u00fan-maw*, or *Bhoon-maw*).\u2014Celebrated pagoda in Talaing Thaung-g\u00fan village, Tenasserim, British Burma. Built in\n1341 A.D. by an exiled Pegu prince on a bluff called Kyit-sa-maw, about 3 miles north-east of Tavoy. It is octagonal in shape, 41 feet high, and 117 feet in circumference at the base, and still carries a Talaing-ti.\n\n**Bur\u00e1balang** (*Old Twister*).\u2014A river of Orissa; rises among the hills of Morbhanj State, in lat. $21^\\circ 52' 45''$ N., and long. $86^\\circ 30' 0''$ E., and after receiving two tributaries, the Gang\u00e1har and the Sun\u00e1ri, passes through Balasor District and flows into the sea, in lat. $21^\\circ 28' 15''$ N., and long. $87^\\circ 6' 0''$ E. The river takes its name from its snake-like course. The tide runs up 23 miles. In the upper reaches, the banks of the river are sandy, steep, and cultivated. In the lower part, they are of firm mud, covered to high-water mark with black slime, and bordered by jungle or open grassy plains. The Bur\u00e1balang is navigable by brigs, sloops, and sea-going steamers as far as Balasor town, about 16 miles up its winding course. A sandbar across the mouth renders the entrance difficult for shipping. *(See Balasor District.)*\n\n**Bur\u00e1 Dharl\u00e1** (or *Nilkum\u00e1r*).\u2014Tributary of the Dharla river, in Rangpur District, Bengal. The name would seem to imply that this was at one period a channel of the Dharl\u00e1.\n\n**Bur\u00e1 Mantreswar.**\u2014A name given to the mouth of the Hugli river, Bengal.\n\n**Bur\u00e1 T\u00edst\u00e1.**\u2014The name given to several old channels of the Tista river, Bengal.\n\n**Burdu.**\u2014Town in Gwalior territory, Central India. Population (1881) 6841.\n\n**Burgh\u00far** (*Barg\u00far*).\u2014A range of hills in Coimbatore District, Madras Presidency; average height, 2500 feet above the sea; highest point, 5000 feet. Lat. $11^\\circ 49' N.$, long. $77^\\circ 36' E.$ In length about 30 miles, and crossed by the road from Erode to Collegal (K\u00e1llig\u00e1l). Little is known of these hills, which are very wild and picturesque. Game of all kinds abound.\n\n**Burgh\u00far** (*Barg\u00far*).\u2014Village in Coimbatore District, Madras Presidency. Situated in a depression in the hills to which it gives its name. Connected with the railway at Erode by a decent road of about 45 miles in length.\n\n**B\u00farha.**\u2014Revenue Sub-division or *tahs\u00edl* in B\u00e1lg\u00e1h\u00e1t District, Central Provinces. Area, 1695 square miles, of which 491 are cultivated, 257 cultivable, and 947 uncultivable; number of villages, 802; occupied houses, 54,500; population (1881) 266,415, namely, 131,257 males and 135,158 females; average density of population, 157 per square mile. Amount of land revenue, including cesses, levied from the landholders, \u00a315,434; amount of rental paid by the cultivators, \u00a328,906, or an average of 1s. 10d. per cultivated acre. The administrative staff consists of a Deputy Commissioner and Assistant\nCommissioner, tahsild\u00e1r, mun\u00edsf, and 3 honorary magistrates. These officers preside over 4 civil and 4 criminal courts; police stations (th\u00e1n\u00e1s) 4, with 12 outposts; strength of regular police, 120 men; village watchmen (chaukid\u00e1rs), 681.\n\nBurha.\u2014Town and administrative head-quarters of B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t District, Central Provinces. Lat. 21\u00b0 48' 30\" N., long. 80\u00b0 14' E. Situated on a high ridge of micaceous shale, about 10 miles south of the main range of hills, and 1 mile from the W\u00e1ingang\u00e1 river. Population (1881) 3573, chiefly agricultural; Hindus, 3377; Muhammadans, 616; Christians, 34; aboriginal tribes, 106. On the north and west sides the soil appears well suited for mango cultivation, and large mango groves shelter the town.\n\nBurh\u00e1na.\u2014Tahsil and town, Muzaffarnagar District, North-Western Provinces.\u2014See Budh\u00e1na.\n\nBurh\u00e1npur.\u2014Revenue Sub-division or tahsil in Nim\u00e1r District, Central Provinces, lying between 21\u00b0 4' 15\" and 21\u00b0 37' 15\" N. lat., and between 75\u00b0 59' 15\" and 76\u00b0 50' E. long. Area, 1138 square miles, of which 168 are under cultivation, 363 cultivable, and 607 uncultivable; number of towns or villages, 130; number of houses, 18,991, of which 16,583 are occupied, and 2,408 unoccupied. Total population (1881) 77,123, namely, 40,003 males and 37,120 females; average density, 102 persons per square mile. Amount of Government land revenue, including cesses, levied from the land-holders, \u00a37295; amount of rental paid by the cultivators, \u00a312,268, or an average of 2s. 2\u00bdd. per cultivated acre. The Sub-division contains 3 civil and 2 criminal courts; strength of regular police, 40.\n\nBurh\u00e1npur.\u2014Town in Nim\u00e1r District, Central Provinces. Lat. 21\u00b0 18' 33\" N., long. 76\u00b0 16' 26\" E. On the north bank of the river T\u00e1pti, about 40 miles south by west from Khandwa, and 2 miles from the Great Indian Peninsula Railway Station of L\u00e1lb\u00e1gh. Population (1881) 30,017, namely, males 15,442, and females 14,575. Hindus numbered 20,991; Kab\u00edrpanthis, 62; Satn\u00e1m\u00eds, 30; Muhammadans, 8735; Jains, 195; Jews, 3; aboriginal tribes, 1. Municipal income in 1880\u201381, \u00a35360, of which \u00a33619 was derived from taxation, at the rate of 2s. 4\u00bdd. per head of the population. It was founded about 1400 A.D. by Nasir Kh\u00e1n, the first independent prince of the Farukh\u00ed dynasty of Kh\u00e1ndesh, and called by him after the famous Shaikh Burh\u00e1n-ud-d\u00edn of Daulat\u00e1b\u00e1d. Though the rival Muhammadan princes of the Deccan repeatedly sacked the place, eleven princes of the Farukh\u00ed dynasty held Burh\u00e1npur down to the annexation of their kingdom by the Emperor Akbar in 1600. The earlier Farukh\u00eds have left no monument except a couple of rude minarets in the citadel, called the B\u00e1dhsh\u00e1h Kil\u00e1; but the twelfth of the line, Ali Kh\u00e1n, considerably improved the city, and built the handsome Jam\u00e1 Masjid, still in excellent preserva-\ntion. Under Akbar and his successor, Burh\u00e1npur was greatly embellished. In the *Ain-i-Akbari* it is described as a 'large city with many gardens, in some of which is found sandal-wood; inhabited by people of all nations, and abounding with handicraftsmen. In the summer the town is covered with dust, and during the rains the streets are full of mud and stone.' Burh\u00e1npur formed the seat of government of the Deccan princes of the Empire till 1635, when Aurang\u00e1b\u00e1d took its place. After this event, Burh\u00e1npur became the capital of the large s\u00fabah of Kh\u00e1ndesh, usually governed by a prince of the royal blood.\n\nThe transfer had not occurred at the time when Sir Thomas Roe, Ambassador in 1614 from James I. to the Great Mughal, paid his visit to Prince Parviz, son of Jah\u00e1ngir, the governor, which he thus describes: 'The cutwall, an officer of the king so called, met me well attended, with sixteen colours carried before him, and conducted me to the seraglio where I was appointed to lodge. He took his leave at the gate, which made a handsome front of stone; but, when in, I had four chambers allotted to me, like ovens and no bigger, round at the top, made of bricks in the side of a wall, so that I lay in my tent, the cutwall making his excuse that it was the best lodging in the town, as I found it was, all the place being only mud cottages, except the prince's house, the chan's, and some few others. I was conducted by the cutwall to visit the prince, in whose outward court I found about a hundred gentlemen on horseback waiting to salute him on his coming out. He sat high in a gallery that went round, with a canopy over him and a carpet before him. An officer told me as I approached that I must touch the ground with my head bare, which I refused, and went on to a place right under him railed in, with an ascent of three steps, where I made him reverence, and he bowed his body; so I went within, where were all the great men of the town, with their hands before them like slaves. The place was covered overhead with a rich canopy, and under foot all with carpets. It was like a great stage, and the prince sat at the upper end of it. Having no place assigned, I stood right before him; he refusing to admit me to come up the steps, or to allow me a chair. Having received my present, he offered to go into another room, where I should be allowed to sit; but by the way he made himself drunk out of a case of bottles I gave him, and so the visit ended.'\n\nForty-four years after Sir Thomas Roe's visit, Tavernier described Burh\u00e1npur (or, as he wrote it, Brampour), through which he then passed for the second time, as 'a great city, very much ruined, the houses being for the most part thatched with straw.' He adds: 'There is also a great castle in the midst of the city, where the governor lives. The government of this Province is a very considerable command, only\nconferred upon the son or uncle of the king. There is a great trade in this city, and as well in Brampour as over all the Province. There is made a prodigious quantity of calicuts, very clear and white, which are transported into Persia, Turkey, and Muscovia, Poland, Arabia, to Grand Cairo, and other places.' The remains of mosques and other buildings show that, at the height of its prosperity under the Mughals, Burh\u00e1npur extended over an area of about 5 square miles. A skilfully-constructed system of aqueducts supplied it with abundance of pure water. Eight sets may still be traced, two of which were channels led off from running streams, partly under and partly above ground. The other six consisted of a number of wells, connected by a subterranean gallery, and so arranged as to intercept the water percolating from the neighbouring hills. The supply thus obtained passes by a masonry adit pipe to its destination in the city or suburbs. All these channels, where they run underground, are furnished at short intervals with tall hollow columns of masonry rising to the level of the water at the source of the works, the object of which seems uncertain.\n\nBurh\u00e1npur played an important part in the wars of the Empire, particularly in the reign of Aurangzeb. In 1685, that prince had hardly left the city with a large army to subjugate the Deccan when the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s took the opportunity to plunder the place. Thirty-four years later, after repeated battles in the neighbourhood, the demand of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s for the chauth, or one-fourth of the revenue, was formally conceded. In 1720, Asaf J\u00e1h Niz\u00e1m-ul-M\u00falk seized the government of the Deccan, and resided chiefly at Burh\u00e1npur, where he died in 1748. By this time the population of the city had greatly diminished; and the brick wall with bastions and nine gateways, erected in 1731, enclosed an area of little more than $1\\frac{1}{4}$ square mile. In 1760, after the battle of Udgi, the Niz\u00e1m ceded Burh\u00e1npur to the Peshw\u00e1, who, eighteen years later, transferred it to Sindhi\u00e1. In 1803, the city was taken by General Wellesley; but it was not until 1860 that, in consequence of a territorial arrangement with Sindhi\u00e1, Burh\u00e1npur came permanently under British government. In 1849, the town was the scene of a desperate and sanguinary affray between Muhammadans and Hindus on the occasion of a Hindu festival. The chief buildings in Burh\u00e1npur are a brick palace built by Akbar, called the L\u00e1l K\u00edl\u00e1, or Red Fort, and the Jam\u00e1 Masjid, or great mosque, built by Aurangzeb. The L\u00e1l K\u00edl\u00e1, though much dilapidated, still contains some fine apartments, and other relics of imperial magnificence. It was formerly shut off from the town by a rampart. The muslin, silk, and brocade manufactures of Burh\u00e1npur were once very famous, and still exist. But the city has long been declining. English fabrics have displaced the 'clear and white calicuts' mentioned by Tavernier; and now the local industry is confined to the manufacture of fine cotton and silk fabrics, interwoven\nwith the gold-plated silver-thread drawn in the city (the purity of which is tested by Government inspection), and of such coarser cotton goods as Manchester has failed to supplant. But the demand for the finer fabrics of gold and silk, and for the best qualities of cloth, has greatly fallen off ever since the luxurious Muhammadan princes gave place to the rude Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. The removal from Burh\u00e1npur of the seat of native government greatly injured the trade of the place; and since the construction of the railway, Burh\u00e1npur has ceased to be an entrep\u00f4t for the traffic between M\u00e1lw\u00e1, the Upper Narbad\u00e1 (Nerbudda) valley, and the Deccan. The city has a post-office, and a travellers' bungalow near the railway station at L\u00e1lb\u00e1gh, a park 2 miles north of the town. An Assistant Commissioner and tahsild\u00e1r reside at Burh\u00e1npur.\n\nB\u00farhap\u00e1ra.\u2014Pargan\u00e1 in Gonda District, Oudh. In shape a rough equilateral triangle, with its apex to the north; bounded on the east by Basti District in the North-Western Provinces, on the south by Babhni-p\u00e1ir, and on the west by S\u00e1dull\u00e1pur pargan\u00e1. Originally a portion of the Kalhans r\u00f3j, for history of which see GONDA DISTRICT. Afterwards conquered by the Path\u00e1n, Ali Kh\u00e1n, who established Utr\u00e4ula, and whose descendants still hold a 2/5ths share of this pargan\u00e1. The remaining 3/5ths share, which was also held by a Muhammadan of the same family, was confiscated for disloyalty during the Mutiny, and bestowed as a reward for good service upon Bhaya Haratan Singh, who is now the principal t\u00e1lukd\u00e1r. The centre of the pargan\u00e1 is a well-cultivated plain, thickly inhabited, but with no distinctive natural features beyond numerous clumps of fine mahu\u00e1 trees, which give a pleasant park-like appearance to the landscape. To the north-west and south, the cultivated plain is bounded by a belt of forest, abounding in game, but yielding every year to the axe and the plough. Total area, 77\u00be square miles, or 49,688 acres, of which 30,330 acres are cultivated. Excluding forest, the revenue-yielding tract comprises an area of 30,303 acres, of which 18,877 acres are cultivated. Autumn crops\u2014rice and kodo; spring crops\u2014wheat, gram, als\u00ed, peas, poppy. Government land revenue demand, under the 30 years\u2019 settlement, is gradually progressive from \u00a31756 in 1873-74 to \u00a32695 at the end of the term. Average incidence per acre of assessed land (excluding forest grants)\u2014in 1873-74, 1s. 10\u00bdd. per cultivated acre, or 1s. 1\u00bdd. per acre of total area; in 1903-04, 2s. 10\u00bdd. per cultivated acre, or 1s. 9d. per acre of total area. Population (1881), Hindus, 24,565, and Muhammadans, 6631; total, 31,196, viz. 15,954 males and 15,242 females. Number of villages, 128. The most numerous caste among the Hindus is the Br\u00e1hman, the R\u00e1jputs being few. The aboriginal Bhars, at one time the rulers of an extensive kingdom, who have entirely disappeared in other parts, are still found here. They follow a nomadic system of\nforest cultivation, wandering from jungle to jungle. Their abandoned clearings are quickly taken possession of by more careful cultivators, such as K\u00farm\u00eds and Ahirs. The villages are connected by rough cart tracks, and the rivers crossed at intervals by fords. Principal export\u2014rice; imports\u2014salt and cotton, both raw and manufactured.\n\n**Burhee.**\u2014Village in Haz\u00e1rib\u00e1gh District, Bengal.\u2014See Barhi.\n\n**Bur\u00ed Dihing.**\u2014River of Assam, which rises among the unexplored mountains to the extreme east of the Province, and flows generally with a westerly course into the Brahmaputra. For some distance it forms the southern frontier of Lakhimpur District, then it crosses that District, and finally forms the boundary between the Districts of Lakhimpur and Sibs\u00e1gar for a few miles above its confluence with the Great River. It is comparatively useless for purposes of navigation. In the rainy season its channel becomes so overgrown with grass, etc., as to be with difficulty penetrated by steamers; while during the rest of the year it dwindles to a very shallow stream, with dangerous rapids. The chief places on its banks are Jaipur and Khowang, both in Lakhimpur District. In the hills above Jaipur there is much mineral wealth of coal, iron, and petroleum, which would attract European enterprise if only the Bur\u00ed Dihing were less difficult of navigation.\n\n**Bur\u00ed Gandak.**\u2014River of Bengal; rises in the Sumeswar range of hills close to the Harh\u00e1 Pass, and flows from north-west to south-east through the Districts of Champ\u00e1r\u00e1n, Muzaffarpur, and Darbhanga, pouring its waters into the Ganges in Monghyr District. At its source it is called the Harh\u00e1; in tapp\u00eds Bah\u00e1s and Madhw\u00e1l, in Champ\u00e1r\u00e1n, it becomes the Sikhren\u00e1; in pargan\u00e1s Simr\u00e1on and Mihsi, the Bur\u00ed Gandak or Muzaffarpur river; and, as it approaches Muzaffarpur District, the Chhota Gandak. Except in the upper reach (called the Harh\u00e1) it is navigable throughout the rains; but in the dry season sandbanks render navigation by large boats impossible from Monghyr District upwards to Nagarbasti, in Darbhanga District. It is navigable all the year round for boats of 200 maunds (7 tons). In the rains, boats of 2000 maunds (75 tons) can go as far as Ruser\u00e1; boats of 1000 maunds (37\u00bd tons) up to Muzaffarpur; and boats of 100 maunds (3\u00bd tons) as far as Sigaul\u00ed, in the north of Champ\u00e1r\u00e1n District. The Bur\u00ed Gandak and the B\u00e1ghmat\u00ed, which flows into it above Ruser\u00e1, convey the produce of Darbhanga to Calcutta. Principal marts\u2014Darbhanga, Muzaffarpur, Somastipur, Ruser\u00e1, and Khargaria.\n\n**Bur\u00edganga** ('Old Ganges').\u2014River in Dacca District, Bengal; a branch of the Dhaleswari, about 26 miles in length, leaving that river a short distance below S\u00e1bh\u00e1r village, and rejoining it at Fatull\u00e1 on the N\u00e1r\u00e1yanganj road. The city of Dacca is situated on the northern bank of this river. The tract between the Bur\u00edganga and the Dhaleswari is\nknown as Paschimdi Island. There is no doubt that the Buriganga was at one time the principal channel of the Ganges, the land to the south being a new formation.\n\n**Burirhat.**\u2014Trading village and produce depot in Rangpur District, Bengal. Lat. 25\u00b0 29' N., long. 89\u00b0 16' 30\" E. Chief exports, jute and tobacco.\n\n**B\u00fariya.**\u2014Town in Jag\u00e1dhri tahsil, Amb\u00e1la (Umballa) District, Punjab. Lat. 30\u00b0 9' 30\" N., long. 77\u00b0 23' 45\" E.; population (1881) 7411, namely 3586 Hindus, 3553 Muhammadans, 156 Sikhs, and 116 Jains; houses, 1578. Situated near the west bank of the Jumna Canal, 3\u00bd miles north of the Sind, Punjab, and Delhi Railway. Built in the reign of the Emperor Hum\u00e1y\u00fan, by B\u00fara, a J\u00e1t zamind\u00e1r; taken by the Sikhs about 1760, and erected into the capital of a considerable chieftainship, which was one of the nine states exempted from the reforms of 1849 (see Amb\u00e1l\u00e1 District), and permitted to retain independent jurisdiction after the reduction of the other chiefs to the position of j\u00e1gird\u00e1rs. Part of the territory has since lapsed, but the remainder still forms the estate of Ji\u00fan Singh, the present representative of the family, who resides in a handsome fort within the town. Other Sikh gentlemen have residences in the place. Considerable manufacture of country cloth; no trade of more than local importance. Municipal revenue in 1881\u201382, \u00a3401, derived from octroi duties.\n\n**Burma, British,** is the name given by the English to the long strip of the Malay Peninsula, stretching down the eastern shore of the Bay of Bengal, and lying between 9\u00b0 55' and 21\u00b0 55' N. lat., and between 92\u00b0 10' and 99\u00b0 30' E. long. British Burma was added to our Indian Empire by the wars of 1824 and 1852. The territory left to the dynasty of Alaungpaya is known to us as Independent Burma; and to the Shans and others as Ava, from the name of a recent capital. British Burma covers an area of 87,220 square miles, and is bounded on the north by Upper or Independent Burma and Eastern Bengal, on the east by Karenni and the Siamese kingdom, and on the south and west by the sea. For administrative purposes British Burma is divided into four Divisions\u2014Arakan, Irawadi, Pegu, and Tenasserim\u2014containing 20 Districts, inclusive of the Salw\u00edn Tracts and Northern Arakan. The northern boundary line, separating the Irawadi and Pegu Divisions from the territory of the King of Burma, leaves the Arakan Yoma hills at a point called the 'ever visible peak,' and, running due east, passes the river Irawadi at its fiftieth mile, and the Pegu Yoma range 43 miles farther on; thence, 33 miles farther on, it crosses the Sittaung river, finally losing itself in a wilderness of mountains 13 or 14 miles farther east. The population in 1881 was 3,736,771. The following table shows the details of area and population, as ascertained by the Census of that year:\u2014\n### Area and Population of Territory under the Administration of the Chief Commissioner of British Burma, according to the Census of 1881.\n\n| British Districts | Area in square miles | Towns and Villages | Houses Occupied | Population (1881) | Population per sq. mile |\n|-------------------|----------------------|--------------------|-----------------|------------------|------------------------|\n| **Akyab, Northern Arakan,** Kyaukpyu, Sandoway | 5,535 | 1,929 | 68,057 | 359,706 | 64.99 |\n|                  | 1,015 | 195 | 3,363 | 14,499 | 14.28 |\n|                  | 4,399 | 937 | 28,601 | 149,393 | 34.65 |\n|                  | 3,667 | 469 | 11,639 | 64,010 | 17.46 |\n| **Total,**       | 14,526 | 3,530 | 111,750 | 587,518 | 40.45 |\n| **Rangoon Town,** Hanthawadi, Pegu, Tharrawadi, Prome | 22 | 1 | 20,655 | 134,176 | 609.891 |\n|                  | 1,807 | 1,394 | 72,115 | 202,925 | 108.70 |\n|                  | 2,369 | 1,385 | 49,816 | 224,795 | 94.90 |\n|                  | 2,014 | 1,650 | 62,800 | 278,155 | 138.11 |\n| **Total,**       | 9,159 | 4,430 | 205,416 | 1,162,393 | 126.91 |\n| **Thayetmyo,** Henzada, Bassein, Thongwa | 2,397 | 872 | 34,080 | 160,560 | 70.74 |\n|                  | 1,948 | 1,231 | 33,499 | 318,077 | 163.28 |\n|                  | 7,047 | 1,669 | 69,812 | 389,419 | 55.26 |\n|                  | 5,413 | 978 | 49,396 | 284,063 | 52.48 |\n| **Total,**       | 16,805 | 4,780 | 208,787 | 1,161,119 | 69.09 |\n| **Maulmain Town,** Amherst, Tavoy, Mergui, Shwegyin, Toung-gu, Salwin Hill Tracts | 14 | 1 | 9,340 | 53,107 | 3793.36 |\n|                  | 15,189 | 1,021 | 50,483 | 301,086 | 19.82 |\n|                  | 7,150 | 291 | 15,464 | 84,988 | 11.89 |\n|                  | 7,810 | 200 | 10,159 | 56,559 | 7.24 |\n|                  | 5,567 | 359 | 31,863 | 171,144 | 30.74 |\n|                  | 6,354 | 830 | 27,708 | 128,818 | 20.28 |\n|                  | 4,616 | 209 | 6,387 | 30,009 | 6.46 |\n| **Total,**       | 46,739 | 3,117 | 151,409 | 825,741 | 17.67 |\n| **Grand total,** | 87,220 | 15,857 | 677,362 | 3,736,771 | 42.84 |\n\n---\n\n1 Formerly called Ramri.\n2 In April 1878, Henzada District, which was formerly called Myanoung, was divided into two, named Henzada and Tharrawadi; Hanthawadi District has, since the date of the Census, been likewise divided into two, named Hanthawadi and Pegu.\n\n**Physical Aspects.**\u2014The shape of the Province, as it figures on the map, somewhat resembles a sea-gull travelling towards the east with wide-extended wings. The northern pinion would be Arakan, stretching from the extreme north and the Naaf estuary to Sandoway, and narrowly confined in all its length between the Yoma Mountains and the sea. The body would include the valleys of the Irawadi and Sittaung, reaching inland for nearly 300 miles; while the southern wing would include the lower valley of the Salwin and Tenasserim, com-\nprised between the mouths of the Sittaung and the P\u00e1kch\u00e1n river, in\nthe Isthmus of Kraw. The extreme length of this stretch of country is\nclose upon 1000 miles.\n\nThe Arakan Division, from the Naaf estuary down to Bluff Point, is\nbounded on the north and east by the high chain of mountains known\nas the Arakan Yoma range, extending in a southerly direction from the\nsouth-eastern extremities of Sylhet and Cachar, and gradually diminish-\ning till it ends at the rocky promontory of Cape Negrais. Though of\nconsiderable height to the north, this chain diminishes in altitude as it\nreaches Arakan, none of the passes across it, in the centre portion, being\nmore than 4000 feet above the sea; the Ayeng pass into the valley of the\nIrawadi is considerably less. The coast between the Naaf estuary and\nSandoway is a labyrinth of creeks and tidal channels, but studded with\nfertile islands, the largest of which are Cheduba and Ramri. Farther\nsouth, the coast between Sandoway and Cape Negrais is rugged and\nrocky, offering few or no harbours for ships. Owing to the nearness to\nthe coast of the Arakan Yoma range, there are no large streams flowing\ninto the sea. Of the marine inlets the principal are the Naaf estuary,\nabout 30 miles in length, and 3 miles broad at its mouth, shallowing\nconsiderably towards its head; the Mayu river, an arm of the sea running\ninland more than 50 miles, and from 3 to 4 miles broad at its mouth\nand the Kuladan or Arakan river, rising in the Lushai hills, near the Blue\nmountain, in lat. 23\u00b0 N., with Akyab, the chief Divisional town, situated\non the right bank close to its mouth. The Kuladan is navigable for 40\nmiles from its mouth by vessels of 300 or 400 tons burthen. The other\nrivers in this portion of the province are the Talak, the Ayeng, the\nSandoway, and the Gwa, the last named being a good haven for small\nsteamers, or vessels of from 9 to 10 feet draught. The soil throughout\nis alluvial, mixed in places with sand; the islands are of volcanic\nformation, and though rocky are fertile.\n\nThe Pegu and Irawadi Divisions, the most productive of the whole\nProvince, comprise the whole of the lower portions of the valleys of the\nIrawadi and Sittaung, the watershed between being the Pegu Yoma\nrange of hills, which terminate in low hills at Rangoon; the Paung-\nlaung range running to the east of the Sittaung valley. In this portion\nof the Province, the main rivers are the Irawadi, the Hlaing or\nRangoon, the Pegu, and the Sittaung. The Irawadi flows from its\nundiscovered sources about 800 miles before reaching British posses-\nsions. Through these, its waters roll on in a south-south-west direction\nfor 240 miles, when the river empties itself by ten mouths into the sea.\nAs it approaches the coast, the Irawadi divides into numerous branches,\nconverting the lower portion of the valley into a network of tidal creeks.\nThe first branch from the main stream is given off from a point about\n9 miles above Henzada town, flowing westwards past the town of\nBassein, and entering the Bay of Bengal by two main mouths; this branch, usually known as the Bassein river, is navigable by vessels of heavy burthen for a distance of 80 miles, or up to Bassein, a port of some importance. The Irawadi is navigable for river steamers as far as Bhamo, 600 miles beyond the frontier. The velocity of its waters when the river is full is five miles an hour; the river commences to rise in March, and continues to rise until September (flooding the surrounding lowlands), when it begins to fall. The Hlaing rises close to Prome, and flows in a southerly direction till, passing Rangoon, it is joined by the Pegu and Pu-zwun-daung rivers, coming from the north-east and the east. The two latter streams rise close together in the Yoma range, about 58 miles above the town of Pegu. The Rangoon river also communicates by numerous channels with the principal delta branch of the Irawadi. The Sittaung river rises far north of British territory, and during the dry weather is with difficulty navigable by boats of any draught. Below Shwe-gyin, where it receives the waters of the Shwe-gyin river, it gradually widens; and after a backward curve, it issues through a funnel-shaped basin into the Gulf of Martaban, spreading so rapidly that it is difficult to distinguish where the river ends and the gulf begins. The valleys of the Irawadi and the Sittaung unite towards their mouths to form an extensive plain, stretching from Cape Negrais to the head of the Gulf of Martaban. The plains portion of these two valleys is highly cultivated, and is the richest part of the whole Province. Owing to the spurs thrown out by the Pegu Yoma range, the main valleys of the Irawadi and Sittaung are divided into several smaller ones. A strip of country in the Sittaung valley on the west, about 25 or 30 miles broad, is covered with dense jungle, which stretches down as far south as Shwe-gyin. The coast line from Cape Negrais to the Gulf of Martaban is low and flat.\n\nThe Tenasserim Division, or southern portion of the Province, lying along the coast between the parallels of 10\u00b0 and 18\u00b0 N. lat., is bounded on the east, at a distance of from 30 to 40 miles from the coast, by a chain of hills, in some places reaching to a height of 5000 feet. The breadth of this chain near Martaban has never been ascertained, but near Tavoy it appears to be about 40 miles wide, whence it gradually narrows to 10 miles near Mergui. The coast-line is very irregular and low for some miles inland, beyond which the surface of the country is mountainous, thinly populated, and much intersected by streams. The soil of the northern portion of Tenasserim is alluvial. Stratified sandstone is the prevailing rock, interspersed with veins of quartz, in which crystals of great beauty are sometimes discovered.\n\nThe great river of the Tenasserim Division is the Salw\u00edn (Salween). Its source has never been explored, but 600 miles due north of its mouth, between Talifu and Momien, in the Province of Yunan, it\nflows a rolling torrent, with a shingle bed 140 yards wide. Owing to numerous rapids and rocks, it is only navigable for a few miles from Maulmain, the point at which it enters the sea. Near Maulmain the Salwin is joined by the Gein Mayu and its tributaries. The other rivers of the Tenasserim Division are the Bilin, which rises in the Paunglaung hills, and, flowing south, enters the Gulf of Martaban between the Salwin and the Sittaung; the Zami; the Tavoy, whose mouth affords excellent anchorage for ships; and the Tenasserim, which rises in about 15\u00b0 N. lat., and flows past the town which gives its name both to the stream and the Division. It enters the sea by two mouths, the northern channel being navigable by boats for about 100 miles.\n\nThree chief ranges of hills traverse the Province of British Burmah, from north to south. Their configuration has been well described by Colonel Yule. To the west is the Arakan Yoma, a cramped and stunted prolongation of the great multiple congeries of mountains which start from the Assam chain. Seven hundred miles from its origin in the N\u00e1g\u00e1 wilds, it sinks into the sea by Cape Negrais; the last bluff is crowned by the Hmawden pagoda, gleaming far to seaward, a Burmese Sunium. The Pegu Yoma, the range which separates the Sittaung from the Irawadi valley, starts from Yeme-thin in Upper Burma, and stretches south with a general direction in the meridian to a parallel a little higher than the head of the delta. Here it branches out into several low terminal spurs, the extremity of one being crowned by the Burman cathedral of Buddhism, the great shrine of Shwe Dagon. The Paunglaung, which divides the Sittaung and the Salwin valleys, is a meridional chain, some of the peaks of which, in the neighbourhood of Toung-gu, reach an altitude of more than 6000 feet. The Tenasserim Hills may be regarded as a prolongation of this range. They form the boundary between the territory of Tenasserim and Siam. The Yoma ranges are composed mainly of brown or grey-slate clay, alternating with beds of sandstone, assuming at times a basaltic character.\n\nThe lakes in the Province would be more properly entitled lagunes, and there are few of any importance. The best known is the Kandawgyi, or 'Royal Lake,' near Rangoon. The T\u00fa Lake, in Henzada District, is 9 miles in circumference and $2\\frac{1}{2}$ miles across; there are also two lakes in Bassein District, each about 5 miles in circumference. A canal connects the Pegu and Sittaung rivers; and another, the Rangoon and Irawadi rivers.\n\nThe country throughout the Delta is flat and uninteresting. Towards Prome the valley of the Irawadi contracts, and the monotony of the plain is diversified by a wooded range of hills, which cling to the western bank nearly all the way to the frontier. The Salwin valley contains occasional harmonies of forest, crag, and mountain stream: but they bear the same relation to the wild sublimity of the Himalayas as the\nTrossachs to the Alps. On the other hand, the scenery in Tavoy and Mergui, and among the myriad islets which fringe the Tenasserim coast, is almost English in its verdure and repose. A large part of the Province is covered with forests, a small part of them being reserved by the State. The teak plantations lie in the valleys of the Irawadi and the Sittaung.\u2014See Amherst District.\n\nHistory.\u2014The Golden Chersonese, as Ptolemy designated it, has played a quite insignificant r\u00f4le in the world's history, as compared with the other two great peninsulas of Asia\u2014India and Arabia. Each of the three has been the home and stronghold of a colossal creed. But while Arabia and India are indissolubly connected with the fabric of modern civilisation, the Burman peninsula has remained isolated and unknown, the battle-ground and grave of strange races and kingdoms, who appear and disappear with scarcely an echo from their existence penetrating to the outer world. Our present possessions comprise the sites of at least four ancient kingdoms\u2014Arakan, Thah-tun, Martaban, and Pegu. The meagre annals which remain ascribe to each an Indian origin, and it is from India, no doubt, that their literature and religion have been derived. Indeed, several of the names which we find in the Tables of Ptolemy assigned to the Golden Chersonese (properly in his geography the delta of the Irawadi) are purely Indian, and show that Indian influence already prevailed on the coast. The ancient history of British Burma is to a large extent involved in that of Independent Burma; and to that article the reader is also referred. The researches of Dr. Forchhammer, of Rangoon, are opening up stores of materials for a complete treatment of the archaeology and epigraphy of the Province. I regret that the limited scope of this article precludes me from utilizing his valuable labours.\n\nThe Arakanese chronicle (see Akyab District) relates how the Burman peninsula was first colonized by a prince from Benares, who established his capital at Sandoway. The next irruption was by the Burmese race from the east; but apparently they made little head against the indigenous tribes, till another legendary prince (this time of Gautama's line) arrived as their champion and king. His dynasty was probably superseded by a fresh invasion from Burma, occurring, according to their chronology, in B.C. 825; and the Buddhist religion was introduced during the reign of the twenty-ninth monarch of the new line, A.D. 146. About the year 970 A.D., the country was attacked by the Shans, who retired after eighteen years' possession. One of the old dynasty then recovered the kingdom, with the help of the Burmese, at Pagan; and similar aid was given to one of his successors against a rebel nearly 100 years later. In the reign of Gaw-laya, who ascended the throne about 1133, the Kings of Bengal, Pegu, Pagan, and Siam are said to have acknowledged Arakanese supremacy. During the\nnext century and a half the country suffered largely from inroads made by the Shans and the Talaings, till King Minti, in 1294, repulsed the invaders, and in his turn carried his arms against Pagan and Pegu. This resulted in a long period of comparative immunity, till an act of tyranny, committed by the reigning prince, Min Saw M\u00fcn, in 1404, raised a rebellion against him, and cost the kingdom its independence. The dethroned monarch took refuge in Bengal, and was restored some years later by Musalm\u00e1n aid. Thenceforth the coins of the Arakan kings bore on the reverse their names and titles in corrupt imitations of Persian and N\u00e1gar\u00ed characters, and the custom was continued long after their connection had been severed with Bengal.\n\nThe subsequent history of Burma forms a confused record of intestine strife and foreign war. Despite its mountain barrier, it lay at the mercy of both Burmese and Talaings, and its rulers were generally subject to the one or the other power. The close of the 16th century witnessed the last great struggle between Ava and Pegu; and the King of Arakan availed himself of the weakness of his neighbours in Bengal, to extend his dominion over Chittagong, and northwards as far as the Meghn\u00e1 river. His son aided the Viceroy of Toung-gu in completing the ruin of the Peguan Empire, and endeavoured to retain the Province through the agency of the Portuguese adventurer, Philip de Brito y Nicote, whom he left in charge of Syriam. Nicote, once in power, disclaimed all allegiance, and maintained possession for thirteen years, till subdued and slain by the King of Ava in 1613. During the 17th century Arakan is described by Bernier as the resort of all loose European adventurers. Sebastian Gonzales, a worthy successor to Nicote, established himself on Sandiva (Sandwip) island at the mouth of the Meghn\u00e1, and was for years a terror to the country, till crushed with the help of the Dutch. The middle of the 18th century saw the rise of Alaungpaya ('Alompra'); and Arakan, exhausted by intestine dissension, fell an easy prey, in 1784, to Bodaw Paya, the son of that monarch, and was permanently annexed to the Avan dominion. It was this conquest which first brought the Burmese into contact with our Bengal frontier; and it was mainly acts of aggression from Arakan which led to the war of 1824, and the treaty of Yandab\u00fa two years later, which added Arakan and Tenasserim to our Indian Empire. For thirty-eight years they were administered under the Bengal Government, whose unwieldy bulk stretched over Assam and across the Arakan and Pegu Yomas, up to the Sittaung and Salwin watershed, with the Irawadi delta, as yet unacquired, intervening between the two ranges. In 1853, Pegu and Martaban also passed under British rule. In 1862, the four Provinces were welded into one, with Sir Arthur Phayre as the first Chief Commissioner.\nTha-htun, Pegu, and Martaban were the chief towns in the territory of Ramanna (Ramaniya), called by the Burmese the three places of the Talaings. The M\u00fans or Talaings are a distinct family from the Burmese, and their language is cognate with those of Kambodia and Assam. Tha-htun was probably founded by Indian emigrants from the Coromandel coast several hundred years before the Christian era. The ruins of the city still exist, on a small stream about 10 miles from the sea-shore and 44 miles north-north-west from Martaban. The silting up of the channel has destroyed its position as a port, but it was known in India as a considerable emporium. We possess but scanty records of its history.\n\nIn the 3rd century before Christ, two missionaries were despatched to Tha-htun (known then as Suvarna-bh\u00fami or Golden Land, the Sobana Emporium of Ptolemy) from the third great Buddhist assembly. Tradition falsely relates that Gautama visited the country thirty-seven years before attaining Nirv\u00e1na, and was badly treated by the rude inhabitants of the coast. Another event of importance was the introduction of the Buddhist scriptures by Buddhaghosa, from Ceylon, A.D. 403. The kingdom existed till the close of the 11th century, and the names of 59 monarchs are recorded, whose reigns extended over 1683 years. It was then utterly destroyed by Anawrata, the famous Emperor of Pagan; and the ruthless devastation to which the whole Talaing territory was subjected probably accounts for the paucity of surviving chronicles.\n\nThe city of Pegu, according to native tradition, was founded by emigrants from Tha-htun in A.D. 573. Martaban was built three years later. The conflict between Br\u00e1hman and Buddhist then going on in Southern India no doubt affected the coast of Ramanna, and the new kingdom is mentioned as having successfully repelled an invasion from the adjacent continent. Gradually it came to embrace the whole country between Bassein and Martaban. It is related of the seventeenth ruler, Tissa, that he was converted from heretical doctrines through the courage of a young girl. With him terminated the native dynasty. After Anawrata's conquest, about 1050, Pegu remained subject to Burma for nearly 200 years. Its fortunes began to revive after the capture of Pagan by the forces of Kublai Kh\u00e1n. Magadu, an adventurer who is described as a native of Takaw-w\u00fan, near Martaban, raised the standard of revolt, and speedily found himself in possession of Martaban and Pegu. He defeated the Pagan forces sent to subdue him, and recovered all the Talaing country as far as Henzada and Bassein. He was in some degree feudatory to the King of Siam, in whose service he had been, and who had granted him royal insignia. He died in 1296, after a reign of twenty-two years.\n\nIn 1321, Tavoy and Tenasserim were added to the kingdom, which led to never-ending strife with Siam. During the reign of Binya-\u00fa, who succeeded in 1348, the country was in great peril from the\nChieng-mai Shans and from internal revolt. The king shifted his capital from Martaban to Pegu; and though he conciliated the Shans, he was unable to crush the rebellion. Finally, in 1385, he was deposed by his son, Binya-nwe, the most famous of this line, who ruled under the name of Razadirit. He reigned for thirty-five years, in perpetual strife with Ava. His chief task was to repel invasion, though in 1404 he led a successful expedition into the very heart of the enemy's country. His kingdom embraced the Tenasserim Provinces and the Irawadi and Sittaung delta nearly as far north as Prome. For more than a century after his death Pegu remained in plenty and quiet, under a succession of able rulers.\n\nThe last monarch, Taka-rwut, came to the throne in 1526. His father had quarrelled with the King of Toung-gu, who, now that Ava had fallen to a race of Shan chieftains, was considered the representative of the ancient Burmese monarchy. Tabin Shwe-ti succeeded to this inheritance in 1530, and for four successive years attacked Pegu without avail. At length, in the year 1535, he obtained possession of the capital, and his brother-in-law, Burin-naung, having captured Martaban after a siege of over seven months, the new dynasty was established without further resistance among the Talaings. It is about this period that we begin to have notices of Pegu by Portuguese voyagers. Foreign mercenaries were employed by the new monarch in his subsequent wars both against Ava and Siam; and native historians ascribe his degraded habits and consequent loss of power to his intimacy with western strangers. He reigned for ten years in Pegu, and was succeeded by Burin-naung in 1550, known in Portuguese annals under the name Branginoco. This monarch, after crushing a formidable rebellion among his new subjects, extended his conquests over Prome, Ava, and the Shan States, as far as the Assam frontier. In 1563, he attacked Siam, and subjected it to his sway. On its rebellion six years later, he crushed the insurrection with another huge expedition. He died in 1581, while preparing for an invasion of Arakan. The wealth and magnificence of the Pegu Empire at this time have been described by contemporary travellers. Its swift and utter destruction is without a parallel in Eastern history. The emperor's son, Nanda-burin, succeeded to the throne; and four unsuccessful attempts to reduce Siam crippled the whole resources of the country. Plague, famine, and dissension ensued; the emperor alienated all his feudatories by his wanton cruelty and oppression, and finally his uncle, the King of Toung-gu, united with the King of Arakan and captured the tyrant in his capital, in 1599.\n\nA subsequent invasion from Siam completed the ruin of the country; a country which none of the invaders showed any anxiety to retain in its depopulated and devastated condition. Finally, the\nsplendid dominion of Tabin Shwe-t\u00ed was actually governed for thirteen years by Nicote, the low-born Portuguese adventurer. In 1613, the King of Ava found himself strong enough to subdue the foreigners, and to annex the whole land to his own dominions. Thus, after an interval of more than 400 years, the seat of power was once more fixed in the upper country, and the ancient territory of Ramanna was again administered by Burmese governors. In 1735, the Talaings rose against their conquerors, and not only expelled them from Pegu, but for twenty years maintained their supremacy throughout the country. They were crushed by the irresistible arm of Alaungpaya, who left his new city of Rangoon to testify by its name to the completion of strife. But the Talaings could never be reconciled to Burmese supremacy, and a fresh revolt broke out in 1783, which was repressed with great barbarity by Bodaw Pay\u00e1. The advent of British troops in the war of 1824 gave them a definite hope of delivery, and they were bitterly disappointed at our abandoning the country. At length the famous proclamation of Lord Dalhousie, on the 20th December 1852, relieved them for ever from their ancient oppressors; and ten years later the Province was organized and a Chief Commissioner appointed. The names of this officer and his successors are as follows:\u2014Sir Arthur P. Phayre (appointed in 1862), Lieut.-General A. Fytche (1867), the Hon. Ashley Eden (1871), A. Rivers Thompson (1875), C. U. Aitchison (1878), C. Bernard (1880), C. H. T. Crossthwaite (officiating 1882), and C. Bernard (1884).\n\nPopulation.\u2014British Burma may be considered as perhaps the most progressive of our Indian dependencies, and it is interesting to note the growth and progress of the population since the British occupation of the country. Between 1826 and 1855, Arakan increased in population from 100,000 to 366,310, or an average of 50 per cent. in each decade. In Pegu in 1858, or six years after its annexation, which then included the present Irawadi Division, the population numbered only 890,974 persons; this number at the time of the Census of 1881 had increased to 2,323,512; the increase in the 23 years amounting to 161 per cent. In Tenasserim, three years after its annexation, the population was estimated at about 70,000; by 1855 it had risen to 213,692, or 200 per cent. in 26 years. Between 1855 and 1881, the population of the whole Province had increased from a million and a quarter to nearly four millions. From 1862 to 1872 the rate of growth was 3\u00b713 per cent. per annum, and from 1862 to 1881, 3\u00b714; calculating from these rates, British Burma may reasonably be expected to contain in 1891 upwards of 5 million (5,090,600) inhabitants.\n\nThe last Census of British Burma was taken on the 17th February 1881, when the population was returned at 3,736,771 souls. The density of the population is only 42\u00b78 to the square mile. The\ndetails of the population in the four Divisions of the Province have already been given in the table at the commencement of this article. The males outnumber the females in British Burma by 245,239, the figures obtained by the Census of 1881 being as follows:\u2014Males, 1,991,005; females, 1,745,766, or 87\u00b77 females to every 100 males. Among the Hindus there are only 19 females to 100 males; the Muhammadans intermarry with the natives of the country, who often nominally adopt the religion of their husbands; with them the proportion of women is about half, or 52\u00b75 to every 100 men. The Christians, who include many native Karens, have 81\u00b74 females to every 100 males; the Buddhists, 92\u00b78; and the Nat-worshippers, 95\u00b75. These proportions are for the whole Province. Classified according to age, there were in 1881, under 14 years old\u2014males, 776,890; females, 734,521: above 14 years\u2014males, 1,214,115; females, 1,011,245,\u2014total population in 1881, 3,736,771.\n\nThe number of villages, towns, etc. in the Province in 1881 was 15,857; the number of inhabited houses was 677,362. The ordinary Burman house is built mainly of bamboo. The posts are of wood from the neighbouring forests, the walls and floor being of bamboos split and plaited or laid together. The roof is generally of thatch, made either of grass or of the leaves of a palm locally known as dhani. The floors are always raised above the ground from six to eight feet, and the sleeping apartment is above. Below, in the front, there is often a platform where visitors are received, and above which the cradle may be seen swinging; while under the floor are placed the agricultural implements, cattle, carts, and looms. Among the Burmese and Talaings, the front of the house is generally parallel with the roof ridge. The Chins, however, enter their dwellings at what is generally the end of the house, having, it is said, received the privilege of building their houses in this form, as a mark of royal gratitude, from a former king of Burma in return for favours shown him by the Chin ladies.\n\nThe Karens of the hills also enter their houses by the gable end. Their bamboo structures, tehis as they are called, have a long common passage running from one end to the other, on either side of which are ranged the rooms, in which perhaps as many as twenty different families live. The Karen houses are shifted annually. Under the house live the pigs and fowls, and during the year of residence much filth accumulates. Except among the Talaings, a house may face in any direction. Their houses are all turned to the north, presenting a curious and somewhat unsocial appearance. In the better houses the walls and floors are substantially made of plank, the roof being either thatched or constructed of tiles or wooden shingles. One house in four throughout the Province, and monasteries generally, are built of wood. Houses of the better class are most numerous in the Prome, Henzada, and\nToung-gu Districts, though in the other Districts their numbers are also fairly large.\n\nAccording to the Census there are 4279 monasteries in the Province, or one to every 168 houses, or to every 3\u00b77 villages. The average number of persons per occupied house is 5\u00b75. There are 45\u00b74 houses in each village or town, and each village or town has an average of 236 inhabitants. The number of boats, steamers, and sailing vessels returned by the Census was, for the whole Province, 15,040, and their population numbered 75,315, including 11,202 females. There are 50,831 males and 27,46 females, or altogether 53,577 persons, whose occupations fall within the professional class; the domestic class contains 20,203 males and 5674 females; total, 25,877. The commercial class contains 156,377 persons, of whom 39,095 are females. The agricultural class includes 1,186,151 persons, of whom 502,405 are females. There are 169,052 males and 175,230 females, total 344,282 persons, engaged in industrial pursuits. The indefinite and non-productive class comprises 949,891 males and 1,020,616 females, or altogether 1,970,507 persons, most of whom are children. The population is thus distributed over the above six classes:\u2014Professional, 1\u00b74 per cent. of the whole; domestic, 7 per cent.; commercial, 4\u00b72 per cent.; agricultural, 31\u00b78 per cent.; industrial, 9\u00b72 per cent.; indefinite and non-productive, 52\u00b77 per cent. The number of persons supported by agricultural occupations is 68\u00b756 per cent.\n\nThe following are the 20 principal towns:\u2014Rangoon, population (1881) 134,176; Maulmain, 53,107; Prome, 28,813; Bassein, 28,147; Akyab, 33,989; Henzada, 16,724; Tavoy, 13,372; Toung-gu, 17,199; Shwe-daung, 12,373; Mergui, 8633; Thayet-myo, 16,097; Kyangin, 7565; Allanmyo, 5825; Shwe-gyin, 7519; Yandun, 12,673; Myanaung, 5416; Pantanaw, 6174; Paungde, 6727; Pegu, 5891; Laymyathna, 5355. At the time of British annexation there were not three towns in the Province with a population of 10,000, and scarcely five towns with more than 5000. Since then Maulmain has grown from a fishing village into a town with over 50,000 inhabitants; Akyab, then a petty hamlet, now contains nearly 34,000 souls; and the returns for 1881 show 11 towns with a population of more than 10,000, and 9 with a population of more than 5000. The definition of a \u2018town\u2019 is a purely arbitrary one, the term being applied to all places having 5000 inhabitants and upwards. Six out of the 20 Districts include no town. Prome and Henzada Districts have 3 towns each. Of the villages, 8 have over 3000 inhabitants, 19 over 2000, 142 over 1000, 819 over 500, and 4886 over 200 inhabitants each.\n\nReligion and Ethnography.\u2014Burma may claim at present to be the head-quarters of Southern Buddhism. The religion exists throughout the country in its purest and most amiable form. It is singularly free from sect, the only two parties of any importance differing chiefly on some minor points of ceremonial. There are no trammels whatever of\nclass or caste or creed. The monastic order is open to the highest and lowest alike; its essential demands being a life of purity, temperance, and truth. There are 6498 Pungyis or Buddhist priests in the Province, giving one priest to 500 of the Buddhist inhabitants. The followers of Gautama number more than four-fifths, or 87 per cent. of the whole population; Muhammadans, 4\u00b75; Nat-worshippers, 4\u00b70; while Hindus and Christians constitute each about 2\u00b70 per cent. of the total. Formerly the caste inequalities of Northern India prevailed to some extent among the Burmese. They have long since disappeared, and now the only titles or differences existing are those that belong to the founder or supporter of some religious building, or to the holders of some Government appointment. Elsewhere there is perfect equality, mere wealth not having sufficed hitherto to raise any barrier of distinction. The religions of Hindus, Muhammadans, Buddhists, Nat-worshippers, Christians, Brahmos, Jains, Jews, and Parsis, all have their representatives in British Burma, the numbers belonging to each being as follows:\u2014Buddhists, 3,251,584; Nat-worshippers, 143,581; Hindus, 88,177; Muhammadans, 168,881; Christians, 84,219; Brahmos, 37; Jains, 5; Jews, 204; and Parsis, 83.\n\nThe term Nat-worshippers is thus explained in the Census Report:\u2014\n\n\"Nats\" are spirits supposed to inhabit natural objects, terrestrial and celestial, and to interfere freely in the affairs of man. Some are evil, and their ill-will has to be propitiated by offerings of plantains, cocoa-nuts, fowls, or other such gifts. Some are kind, and their active favour or protection must be gained. The Burmese frequently make offerings to \"Nats,\" and regard the spirit-world with an awe not called for by the creed of Buddha. The belief in \"Nats\" has remained underlying their thoughts and religion ever since they were converted to Buddhism, a relic of the ancient cult, which is still preserved intact among the wilder Karens, Chins, and other hill races. At present, numbers of Karens and Chins, who have come in contact with the Burmese, though knowing little and practising less the religion of Gautama, call themselves Buddhists, because to do so is a sign of civilization and respectability.' The decrease in the number returned of Nat-worshippers within the decade is due to this tendency to call themselves Buddhists, and not to a real falling off in the races forming this religious class.\n\nThe Christian population, which derives its new converts chiefly from among the Karens, was returned as follows:\u2014Europeans, 7866; Eurasians, 4998; natives, 71,355; total, 84,219. Of the Christians, 9980 belong to the Church of England, 16,281 to the Roman Catholic Church, 655 are Presbyterians, 55,874 Baptists, 166 Wesleyans, 340 Lutherans, 131 Armenians, 95 Greeks, and 72 Methodists, the remainder being unspecified. Looking at the distribution of the various sects, the\nChurch of England has most followers in Rangoon (3339), where the English and Eurasian society is large. The Roman Catholics are strongest in Toung-gu (5005). Baptist Christians are most numerous in Bassein District (18,704), and also abound in Thongwa (5594), Hanthawadi (6268), and Toung-gu (11,510). The work done by the various Missions during the decade has been on a large scale.\n\nThe Census Report gives the following account of the marriage customs of the people:\u2014\u2018Among the Burmese, who are all Buddhists, girls are considered the property of the parents, but constraint on their choice of a husband is rarely employed. Child-marriages are practically unknown. Young men make love pretty much where their fancy leads them, first obtaining the consent of the parents, which is generally accorded, unless the young man is of doubtful character. The period of probation during which courtship was carried on, and the suitor carefully watched, was formerly long. It is now much briefer, and early marriage is easier for bachelors than of old. The Burmese mother is a great matchmaker, but she effects her end by peacefully influencing the feelings of the young couple whose union she desires to promote, and not by compulsion. Constraint is sometimes tried, but generally in vain. The young lady in that case either elopes with her favoured swain, or, as occasionally happens, hangs herself. The rule, however, is that the consent of the parent is requisite at a first marriage, and the practice is that the girl\u2019s consent is also essential. The main element in the marriage ceremony is the publication of the union.\n\n\u2018By Buddhist law, polygamy is permitted, but is rare. Occasionally, officials or wealthy traders have more than one wife, but polygamy is not looked upon as altogether respectable. Sometimes the elder wife strongly objects to being practically set aside, sometimes she acquiesces quietly in the arrangement, living in another house. Divorce is easily obtained. If the pair are agreed, elders are summoned, and the divorce takes place at once. If either the husband or the wife refuses to be divorced, the question is not whether the divorce can be effected, but how the common and peculiar property is to be divided. If no cause for requiring a separation is shown, the unwilling party takes all the common property. In some cases the applicant for divorce gets the whole. Disputed claims for divorce are often brought before the Civil Court, but as all grades of judges can grant decrees of separation, and indeed cannot refuse them, the only doubtful point being the disposal of the property, the difficulty of divorce is not materially enhanced. While, however, divorce is easily and rapidly obtained, the proportion of divorced persons to married couples is small. Married life in Burma, where the women carry on a great part of the trading and shopping, and amuse themselves after their own fancy, is very happy. Children are numerous, and separation of husband and wife by any cause but death\nmay be said to be comparatively rare. Among the Karens, Chins, and other hill tribes, marriage customs differ from those of the Burmese, where the original habits have been preserved; but where these people have come in contact with the ruling race, their customs have been much modified, and little difference is observable. The children of Karens, except in the Karennee Clan, are generally betrothed by their parents, and subsequent non-fulfilment of the contract is expiated by a heavy fine.\n\n'Polygamy is not allowed by the Karen law, but among those who have embraced Buddhism, and mingled with the Burmese, it is occasionally practised. Adultery is the only ground on which divorce is permitted among the Karens. It is regarded as a great offence, but is not altogether rare. Chastity before marriage is not much regarded among any of the hill races. Among the Chins, marriage is a simple contract with the consent of the girl's brother or parents. Large presents are at the same time made by the suitor, and girls are often affianced early in life. Polygamy is common; but the consent of the first wife's brother is required before the second wife can be taken. For certain misbehaviour on the part of the husband, the wife's brother, who, instead of the parents, acts as guardian, may take her away. On the death of the husband, his brother takes the widow as his wife. Divorce is possible, but, if there is no proved offence, the husband is fined, and loses all claim to dowry. These customs, where they differ from those of the Burmese, are rapidly disappearing, and are preserved in their integrity only in the recesses of the hills.'\n\nIn regard to education, 26\u00b72 per cent. of the whole population of the Province are either under instruction, or are able to read and write. The education of the females is far behind that of the males. Of the latter, 46\u00b70 per cent. are educated or under instruction; but of the former, only 3\u00b76 per cent. can be so described. Scattered all over the country, but more numerous in some parts than in others, are monasteries, in which the Pungy\u00eds or Buddhist monks live together with probationers and novices, separated from the ordinary business of life. The Census Report returns 4279 such monasteries, or 1 to every 3\u00b77 villages, and to every 168 houses. Often there are two such buildings in one village; and except in wild tracts of country, the Kyaung, as the monastery is called in Burmese, is seldom distant from any hamlet. One of the chief occupations of the monks is the teaching of the boys of the neighbouring villages, and every Buddhist child passes some period of his life in a Kyaung, learning to read and write, and imbibing, to a certain extent, the precepts of Buddhist law. Poverty of a boy's parents, or other causes, may occasionally prevent him from assuming the sacred yellow robe, with the somewhat costly ceremonies; but, although not a regular novice, he may become a Kyaungtha or monastery boy for\na time, and so get a smattering of learning. In the larger villages, in addition to the monasteries, schools are often found kept by respectable elders, who desire to gain merit by engaging themselves in the education of youth, both boys and girls; the latter are excluded from the monasteries. As compared with other Provinces of India, British Burma has a highly-educated population, excepting in the Northern Arakan and Salwin Hill tracts, where the hill tribes form the inhabitants, among whom book-learning is almost unknown.\n\nEthnically, the population of British Burma varies to a considerable extent. The numbers returned by the Census of 1881 of the chief races inhabiting the country were\u2014Burmese, 2,612,274; Talaings, 154,553; Karens, 518,294; Chins or Khyins, 55,015; Taunghas, 35,554; Kwaynies and Mros, 24,794; Shans, 59,723; Chinese, 12,062; natives of India, 241,449. It is at present generally admitted that the only race living in the Province, of whose advent in it nothing is known either by tradition or history, is the Talaing, as this people is called by the Burmese, or the Mon as they term themselves, and they are undoubtedly the oldest residents,\u2014the aborigines of the country. Several centuries before the Christian era, men of the Dravidian family came from India, no doubt for purposes of trade to Suvarna Bh\u00fami or Ramaniya, as the tracts about the mouths of the Irawadi, Sittaung, and Salwin were then called. They found a wild race inhabiting the country, with whom they intermarried, and among whom they dwelt. This race were, no doubt, the Mon; but they received the title of Talaings from the name of the ancient country of Teleng\u00e1na, whence the colonists had sailed, and this name was extended to all Mons who in later times became known through the medium of the Dravidian colonists.\n\nThe city of Tha-hton, now 8 miles from the sea, was, at the time of its foundation by the colonists, and for some centuries afterwards, on the coast. In the third century before Christ, Buddhist missionaries reached Tha-hton, and two centuries later, the capital of the Talaing kingdom was transferred to Pegu, and the Burmese, who were moving southwards, came into contact with the Buddhist Talaings, and through them acquired their alphabet, their literature, and their religion. The oppression and cruelty endured by the Talaings, as the whole Mon race was now called, at the hands of their conquerors, the Burmese, explains the rapid disappearance of the Mon language, and the migration into Tenasserim during the early days of British rule. Their language was discouraged after the conquest of Pegu by Alompra in 1757, and furiously proscribed after the first Burmese war, in which the Talaings assisted the British arms, and it has ever since been rapidly giving way to Burmese.\n\nIn physical characteristics the Talaings differ little from the Burmese.\nTheir features are perhaps more regular, the nose is not so flat, and the face is longer. The complexion of the men is often of a darker and less yellow hue than that of the Burman. Sometimes they have been described as fairer than the Burmese. The Dravidians have left no trace of their colonization in the language of the natives, beyond the name Talaing; and the Hindu sculptures found at Tha-hton, Pagat, and elsewhere, are the only permanent record of the existence of an ancient Hindu colony in the neighbourhood, unless we are to ascribe the differences of feature characteristic of the Talaing to an admixture of Dravidian blood. There are in British Burma 154,553 pure Talaings, and 177,939 persons of mingled Burmese and Talaing parentage, or Talaings who speak only Burmese. Of the pure Talaings more than half are in Amherst District. Under the head of the Mramma family, and included in a group which may be called Burmese, come the Arakanese, Burman, Tavoy, Chaunghtha, Yaw, and Yabein languages and races.\n\nThe Arakanese, also, differ but little in feature from the Burmese; and though their spoken language is so dissimilar from that of the latter as to be almost unintelligible, when written it is the same in almost all respects. The Chaunghthas, or 'children of the stream,' are but a part of the Arakanese nation. The Yaws also are a people not differing much from the Burmese either in race or language. They live on a western tributary of the Irawadi, about the latitude of Pagan, and have been described as the pedlars of Upper Burma. The Yabein is almost indistinguishable from the Burmese in feature, and the only practical distinction between the two is that the former are rearers of silkworms, an occupation seldom or never adopted by the pure Burman. The Burmese in their traditions claim for themselves a western origin and a connection with the solar races of India. It is probable that the lower part of the valley of the Ganges was formerly occupied by people speaking languages of the class sometimes called Mramma before the advent of the Aryans; but, as regards the Burmese, it seems more natural to believe, as Sir Arthur Phayre writes, that they passed from the table-lands of Central Asia round the Eastern Himalayas. A kingdom was formed at Tagaung; and thence, it is said, a portion of the people went westwards into Arakan, while the remainder moving southwards, founded fresh kingdoms in Prome and Toung-gu, where the Burmese language is still supposed to be spoken in greater purity than elsewhere in Burma.\n\nThe hill tribes of Arakan who live near the Kuladan river and its tributaries, namely, the Sak, Chaw, Kwaymi, Kun, Mro, and Shandu, belong by origin to the same Mramma group as the Burmese, and their language belongs to what is sometimes called the Tibeto-Burman family. Of these hill tribes, the Shandus are the most warlike\nand numerous; they are probably the same race as the Kukis, who, according to Colonel Dalton, stretch from the valley of the Kuladan to the border of Manipur and Cachar, a distance of 300 miles. The Kwaymis and Mros differ but little in appearance and habits. It is probable that these tribes are more or less connected with the Nagas. The Chins or Khyins are widely extended in British Burmah, being found on both sides of the Arakan Yoma, and also in the Thayetmyo and Prome Districts, to the east of the Irawadi river. In Upper Burma there are large numbers. The most remarkable fact about them is that they tattoo the faces of their young girls so as not to leave even an eyelid free from the hideous operation. They are rapidly adopting Burmese habits and clothing on the Pegu side of the Arakan Yoma range, and their language is also giving way to Burmese.\n\nThe Karens are, next to the Burmese, the most numerous race in British Burma. The oldest seat of these people is thought to have been on the north-west of China, where they may have come in contact with Jewish colonies, and have acquired the traditions which have made them so willing to accept Christianity at the hands of missionaries. Thence the Karens, pressed by the growth of population in Central Asia, moved south towards Yunan; and finding the country they had intended for themselves already occupied by another race, the Shans, they turned off to the south-west, proceeding along the hills on either side of the Sittaung and Salwin rivers, and settling into their present positions about the sixth century of the Christian era. There are three main groups of Karens, the Sgaw or Burman-Karen, the Pwo or Talaing-Karen, and the Bhgeh or Bweh. The Karens of the delta of the Irawadi, and of the interior of Tenasserim, including the District of Shwe-gyin, belong to the Pwo and Sgaw. In Toung-gu District, the Sgaws are found in the west, and the Bwehs on the east. The latter are also found in Salwin District. The Bwehs include the Red-Karens.\n\nThe Shans are not an indigenous race, but they immigrate in considerable numbers from the Shan States. Outside of British territory they are very numerous, stretching from the north-east of the kingdom of Ava to Bankok. They are of the same origin as the Ahams and Khamtis of Assam. The appearance of the Shans in these more southern regions is of comparatively recent date. The completion, in 1884, of the Rangoon and Sittaung Valley State Railway will, it is anticipated, cause Shan immigration to assume important proportions. The Shans are careful cultivators, and hard working, and are also great traders and pedlars. The Taunghus, owing to a similarity of dress, somewhat resemble the Shans in personal appearance. They are rather short of stature and thickly built, and are a clannish and taciturn people. The name by which they are known signifies 'hillman,' but like the Shans, they settle in the plains of British Burma. It is believed that the\nTaungh\u00fas are connected by race with the Karens, their habits and dress having been modified by long contact with the Shans. After arrival in British Burma, the younger members of the families soon adopt the Burmese dress and habits.\n\nThe only other races which call for any special notice, are the Daingnete and the Salones. The former dwell among the hills near the Chittagong frontier; in feature they are somewhat like the Gurkhas of Nepal. They dress in white, and wear their hair at the back of the head; their bodies are not tattooed, nor do they intermarry with other races. The Salones live in the various islands of the Mergui Archipelago; they are a tribe of sea-gypsies, living in the dry weather in their boats, and during the Monsoon seeking a temporary shelter in huts built on the lee-side of the islands. They are said to be divided into several clans, which have each a recognised right to fishing grounds within certain limits. They pay no taxes. In personal appearance, they are between the Malays and the Burmese.\n\nIn every 10,000 of the population of the Province, 8550 persons were born in British Burma, while 1450 were born out of the country. Of these 1450 aliens, 846 are natives of Upper Burma, 494 are from India, 275 from Bengal, 199 from Madras, 11 from the North-Western Provinces and Oudh, and 9 from other parts of India; 30 are Chinamen, and 51 are Shans.\n\nSocial Condition of the People.\u2014Under the Burman rule, before Pegu was annexed, there was a great gulf between the Burmans and the Karens. The latter feared the Burmese, and looked upon them as oppressors. The Karens, free from the oppression of the Burmans since the British annexation, are now more generally adopting the Burman customs, language, and religion. But the greatest change among the Karens has been wrought by the preaching of the missionaries, by whose agency they have been turned from Nat-worship to Christianity. There are now no fewer than 451 Christian Karen parishes; most of these support their own church, their own Karen pastor, and their own parish school, and many subscribe considerable sums in money and in kind for the furtherance of missionary work among the Karens and other hill races beyond the British border. Christianity continues to spread among the Karens, and their Christian communities are distinctly more industrious, better educated, and more law-abiding than the Burman villages around them.\n\nThe monastic schools of Burma form, as has been already stated, an important feature in the social policy of the country. Before the British came to Burma, every town or village had its Kyaung or monastery, where the boys of the place were taught to read and write, and were instructed in religion by the phugyis or monks. These monks do not officiate at pagodas, or discharge the duties of parish priests. Their\nfunctions are to set an example by their pious lives, and to instruct the young. In former times, boys often left the monastic schools without really learning to read and write; and even those who did learn, found it very difficult to keep up knowledge where there were no printed books, and very little literature of any kind. Still the presence of a body of monks, who observed their vows, who cultivated learning, and who were held in high honour, had its effect on the Burmese. The Buddhist monks are everywhere greatly respected, and the abbots and archbishops are held in great veneration, but the religious orders do not exercise, or pretend to, much political influence. The Burmese pay respect (sheko) after the ancient manner of their country. According to this custom, the inferior person kneels before the superior with bowed head in the attitude of worship, and no Burman will address a Buddhist monk (Phungyi) in a monastery save in this attitude of sheko or worship. But to Burmese of the younger generation, who have learnt English, or who have been to Europe or America, the observance of this custom is repugnant. The increasing practice of sitting on chairs marks another change in social usage. Chairs are now used by Burman assessors in the sessions courts, by Burman judges and magistrates in their own courts, by Burman schoolmasters in government schools, by native members of municipal committees, and by the Sugy\u00eds (aldermen) of the larger towns. All these sit on chairs when transacting business, especially if in the presence of Europeans.\n\nThe people of Burma, by reason of their excitability of character, and their disregard of the sanctity of human life, were formerly prone to crimes of violence. Such offences were wont to be judged leniently by the community; and it is said that young Burmans of respectable family would engage in a robbery or a cattle-lifting expedition to prove their manhood. Even now, murders and woundings are occasionally committed without an adequate motive, as the following instances will show. A and B were neighbours in the same village. A was painting his boat; B did not like the smell of the operation, and told A to desist. A went on painting his boat, and when he had finished, in walking towards his house he passed B, who cut him down with a chopper, and killed him. In another case, a wife cooked the daily meal for her husband; he did not like the curry she had made, and in his displeasure cut his wife down, killing her. In neither case did it appear that there had been much previous ill-feeling between the two parties, or that the murdered person had given other offence to the murderer.\n\nNotwithstanding these occasional ebullitions of violence, a Burman crowd is quiet and law-abiding. At the recent Rangoon boat-races, crowds of from 10,000 to 30,000 people were assembled for three days, and during the whole time only one offence was reported to the police as having occurred among the vast assemblage. 'Under ordinary cir-\ncumstances,' wrote the Army Commission of 1879, 'there was no quieter or more peaceful quarter of Her Majesty's Indian Empire than the Province of British Burma. At the same time, there is an element of danger in the unsteady and excitable character of the people, among whom the prestige of the Court of Ava is very great, and on whom disturbances or troubles on the Mandalay border might react in an inconvenient and mischievous fashion.' The majority of the respectable classes are content with British rule, and the people feel that they have prospered since the annexation. High wages, bountiful returns to the farmer, plentiful food, and freedom from oppression, combine to make the life of an ordinary Burman happy and comfortable.\n\nWomen in Burma occupy a much freer and happier position than they do in Indian social life. They go about freely; manage the household, buy the daily supplies in the baz\u00e1r, and in every respect take an active part in domestic affairs. Industry and thrift among women are promoted by the custom according to which most girls, even in well-to-do families, work looms, or keep stalls in a baz\u00e1r, till they get married. The girls usually spend the profits of their undertakings on dress or personal adornment, and they are not required to contribute their earnings to the common family purse. The Burmese wives make successful women of business; they conduct not merely retail trades, but also large wholesale concerns, on behalf of their husbands, with a liberal, but at the same time a shrewd, sagacity. The husband sometimes lives in idleness on the fruits of his wife's labour. The ratio of female to male prisoners in Burma jails is less than half even the small proportion of women in Indian prisons.\n\nThe articles imported into Burma are luxuries rather than necessaries. During the five years ending 1881, the average surplus of imported over exported treasure has been \u00a31,340,000 a year. The greater part of this silver and gold is converted into ornaments by both Burmans and Karens. It would seem, therefore, that every household of six persons in British Burma must have spent on the average about \u00a312 a year on imported articles and jewellery. These figures indicate a high standard of comfort among Burman families. The average income of a Burman household is much larger than that of a family in Continental India. Wealth is widely distributed. The majority of the people are comfortably off, but there are few rich people. Burmans, as a rule, do not save money. They are open-handed and lavish in their expenditure, giving liberally in charity, and to their monasteries or other pious institutions. They spend freely on dress, on jewels, and on entertainments. The puays, or theatrical displays, which are given at the harvest-home, and on other auspicious occasions in every Burman village, cost a good deal of money, and are much enjoyed by the pleasure-loving people.\n\nOutside the seaport towns, there are few Burmans who could raise\n\u00a3500 at a fortnight's notice; even in Rangoon or Maulmain, there are hardly a score of Burmans who could raise, or whom the banks would trust with, \u00a35000. On the other hand, only a small proportion of the people are in debt. Landholders get into debt sometimes when disease carries off their plough-cattle; and gambling lands many Burmans into difficulties. In a small tract, where special inquiries were made by a settlement officer, it was found that barely 20 per cent. of the cultivators are in debt at all. It is not yet known how far this freedom from debt is characteristic of cultivators throughout the whole Province. Suits for debt are few in comparison with the population. Money-lenders of the ordinary Indian type are almost unknown in Burman villages. In Rangoon and other large towns, a certain number of money-lenders from the Madras coast,\u2014chettis as they are locally called,\u2014have established themselves. At one time it was feared that they would get possession of the cultivator's lands, but there is no ground for this anxiety. Out of 6833 cultivators in the neighbourhood of Rangoon town, only 58 mortgaged any part of their holdings in a year; and in only nine of these cases did the lands pass into the hands of a native of India. The rate of interest is high, and varies according to the security given.\n\nIn all political, social, or special questions which may arise in Burma, it should be remembered that there are no hereditary chiefs, nobles, or great landholders. Even under native rule, the members of the royal family and the officials constituted the only aristocratic class. In British Burma the officials, the elders in the larger villages or towns, and a few merchants and professional men, are the only persons socially above the level of the prosperous cultivators.\n\nThe people are, as a rule, comfortably housed. Outside the large seaport towns there are few masonry dwellings. Wood is plentiful, and most houses are built of timber or bamboos on piles. Their height above the ground varies with the average depth of the inundations; but almost every house is thus raised, and the sleeping-room is usually in the upper storey. In poorer parts of the country, houses are built mainly of bamboos and thatch. In the richer tracts of the delta, and along the great rivers, they are constructed of solid posts and well-seasoned beams, with plank floors, and adorned with wood carvings or quaint pictures. In every such house there is at least one long-armed lounging chair, in which the master of the house takes his ease after the day's work. The houses of the Karens, who are less ready to spend money than Burmans, are usually meaner. In the recesses of the forest, where some of the Karens shift their dwelling-place every two or three years, a Karen settlement of ten or twenty families live together under a common roof; each family having one or more rooms opening on the common passage which runs between the two rows of rooms. These settlements,\nor tehs, are usually on posts eight or ten feet above the ground, to secure their inmates from wild beasts and noxious vapours.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Agriculture is the main employment of the people, and it may be assumed that the production and distribution of rice occupies three-fifths of the whole population. Cotton, sesamum, and tobacco are also grown throughout the Province; gardens and orchards are found near every village; but rice covered about six-sevenths of the total area\u20143,638,845 acres\u2014under cultivation in 1881-82. The enormous foreign demand, and the large profits recently obtained, have greatly increased the cultivation of this cereal. The Burmese are content with a single crop a year, corresponding with the \u00e1man ropa of Bengal. It is sown in June, transplanted in September, and reaped about December or January. Their soil is lavish in its yield, requires little labour, and no artificial stimulus beyond the ash of the past year's stubble, which is burned down and worked into the land. Year after year, without a rest, the heavy rains and this primitive manure suffice to ensure an abundant harvest. The Irawadi valley and its delta furnish about three-fifths of the whole rice produce of the Province. This tract is annually inundated, and an inch more or less of water frequently determines whether the receding flood will leave a rich harvest-laden plain or a waste of ruined crops. Henzada and Bassein Districts have been partially secured by an extensive series of embankments which fringe the right bank of the Irawadi, and the left bank of the Nga-wun river, for nearly 200 miles. But the system of regulation is by no means complete, and the problems which beset the delta of a mighty river have yet to be grappled with.\n\nMuch attention has of late been given to the improvement of the implements of husbandry in British Burma; in particular to ploughs, reaping instruments, carts, and sugar mills. The trials of improved reaping machines and ploughs have so far, however, proved disappointing. There is much room for alteration in the carts used by the people, which are very unwieldy, demanding a maximum of draught-power, and possessing a small carrying capacity. The large cart traffic, especially during the season from January to May, renders it important that an improvement in the construction of these vehicles should take place.\n\nSugar-cane pressing is not carried on extensively in Burma. Hitherto wheat can scarcely be said to have been cultivated, the demand in British Burma being supplied from Upper Burma and India. The Burmese standard measure of one basket (equal to about a bushel) contains, on an average, 60 lbs. The highest price fetched by rice is 3s. per basket; 2s. per basket is considered a very remunerative price by the cultivator. As the wheat imported from Upper Burma is said to yield more flour than the Indian wheat, an endeavour is being made to induce cultivators to grow wheat, which is worth at present (1883) about\n5s. per basket in the Rangoon market. The advantages from the successful cultivation of wheat in British Burma would be three-fold. First, large tracts of land, unsuitable for rice cultivation, would be brought under the plough; second, the people would have a dry-weather harvest to fall back upon in case of the partial failure of their rice; third, the agricultural development of the Province would not depend on a single crop, and the land revenue would benefit in the most legitimate way. To encourage wheat cultivation, suitable ploughs and seed of the best descriptions of Indian wheat are being supplied free, and very favourable terms have been allowed to all cultivators who undertake the experiment.\n\nThe climate and the soil of Burma are well adapted for the cultivation and manufacture of tobacco, which thrives alike in the alluvial plains of the Kuladan and Irawadi deltas and in the hill regions of the Province. The leaf of the Kuladan and the Kyaukkyi regions enjoys a high reputation. The whole population, men, women, and children, may be said to be inveterate smokers. The women have a natural aptitude for the rolling of cigars, which is one of the chief domestic industries of the Province. The area under tobacco is 13,663 acres, or 0.38 per cent. of the total cultivation. The tobacco grown in Burma is, nevertheless, insufficient for the wants of the people. Estimating a yield of 750 lbs. of tobacco per acre, the total out-turn of the Province is over 10,000,000 lbs. of cured tobacco leaf. In 1881\u201382, tobacco leaf to the amount of 15,763,186 lbs. was imported from India, chiefly from Madras. Cigars to the extent of 80,516 lbs. were in the same year exported from Burma. The net consumption per Burman in the form of cigars is 7 lbs. The importance, therefore, of tobacco as an article of domestic consumption in Burma is evident; and, irrespective of a foreign demand, there is a large field for private enterprise. Hitherto, the leaf has been cured in the rudest fashion; but it is believed that with improved cultivation and a better system of curing, the tobacco of Burma will be able to take a place in foreign markets. With this view, arrangements have been made for the more scientific cultivation of the plant, and for curing the leaf on the American method, by the establishment of a tobacco farm and factory under Government auspices, to merge ultimately into a private enterprise.\n\nSugar is both a necessity and a luxury to Burmans, and as much in demand as tobacco. Most of the people are tea drinkers in the Chinese fashion, and they take a piece of caked sugar with each mouthful of tea that they drink. The local consumption of sugar is great, and as the Province does not at present produce anything like a sufficient quantity, large importations are made. The area under sugar-cane in Burma in 1881\u201382 was only 6251 acres. Like tobacco, it thrives more or less in all parts of the Province, but particularly in\nShwe-gyin and the coast Districts. The total production of crude brown sugar in the Province in 1881-82 was about 2779 tons, of which 434 tons were exported. The total imports by sea and land for the same year amounted to nearly 11,617 tons, giving a total yearly consumption of nearly 14,000 tons, or about 8\u00bd lbs. per head of the population. The use of sugar by the Burmans in their tea, which the people of India do not drink as an article of diet, shows that there is a large local demand waiting to be satisfied, and that this demand would increase with extended cultivation. At present the cultivation of the cane is carried on in the rudest and most primitive fashion; the land in many cases is not even ploughed, artificial irrigation is not thought of, and manure is rarely applied. The cane is planted out from August to October, and ripens in twelve months.\n\nJute of several kinds grows wild in Burma, but is rarely cultivated. It is found in great profusion on the sites of deserted or dilapidated villages, and on the edges of swamps, and the fibre obtained from even the wild plant is soft, glossy, and strong. The importance of jute to Burma will be obvious when it is seen that the value of bagging imported into the Province in 1881-82 was \u00a3325,351. As the raw material of these bags is a plant indigenous to the Province, encouragement has been given to the people to cultivate it, and supplies of the best seeds have been largely distributed.\n\nCotton is not a crop which the Burmans care to cultivate. Its cultivation demands much labour, and the climate of the greater part of the Province appears to be unsuited for it. In 1881-82, the total area under cotton was 10,689 acres. The average yield of cleaned cotton per acre for the whole Province was, of field grown, 160 lbs.; of hill grown (taungya), 40 lbs.\n\nIn a Province like Burma, where the peasants are averse to undertaking any cultivation except that which, with the least outlay of labour and money, yields the highest return, and where the people are, as a rule, fond of ease, what is likely to be really useful to them, and to convince them that much more can be made out of their lands even on their own methods, is a series of experimental farms conducted under the eyes of the peasantry. With this view several have been started in various parts of the Province, in which the principal cereals and other important crops are being cultivated according to the Burmese methods, but with care and industry. It is hoped that the people will, when they perceive the harvests yielding a good return in money, gradually take to improved methods, and interest themselves in the raising of new kinds of produce. The stimulus of an unfailing market for raw produce has borne very remarkable fruit. When the people saw steam rice mills springing up at the great ports, where they could dispose of their unhusked rice at good prices, they found it to their advantage to\nextend the cultivation as fast as they could get land, and cattle to work it. In 1867-68, the area under rice was only 1,682,110 acres; there were then 7 rice mills in the whole Province. In 1881-82, the number of mills had risen to 49, and the area under rice cultivation to 3,181,229 acres, or by 89 per cent. in 14 years. The total cultivated area assessed to revenue in 1881-82 was 3,498,688 acres, and the total revenue assessed was \u00a3656,162.\n\nTaungya or jum cultivation prevails chiefly on the Northern Arakan Hills. This system consists in clearing a patch of forest land, setting fire to the fallen jungle, and then sowing in the ashes a miscellaneous crop of cotton, rice, and pumpkins or other vegetables, all of which ripen in about five months. The assessment on jum cultivation is generally made by means of a poll-tax on the husbandman, or on his house, irrespective of the amount of his clearing. The area thus cultivated in 1881-82 was estimated at 47,322 acres, as compared with 109,288 acres in 1875; but the returns can hardly be relied on, owing to the nomadic habit of the cultivators. As population increases, a tendency from extensive to intensive husbandry discloses itself, and jum cultivation is being pushed back more and more into the hills and sparsely-populated tracts, before the advance of plough and tillage.\n\nLand Tenures.\u2014The system of land tenure in Burma is simple. Government is the sole proprietor of the soil, and deals directly with the cultivator, from whom it receives a rent varying from 1s. to 10s. an acre. The average assessment is about 3s. 3d. There are no zamindars or large landed proprietors, and no Government or wards' estates. A new-comer is allowed total exemption from all rent and taxes for a certain period, to enable him to clear his grant. Government then levies a rent 20 per cent. lower than in other Provinces of India; and requires only 2 annas (3d.) an acre for land which may be left fallow. Besides this, a generous allowance is made to the settler for failure in crops or cattle, and he can at any time avail himself of five or ten years' settlement on exceedingly liberal terms. About one-fifth of the area tilled is held under such leases; the other four-fifths of the holdings being annually re-measured and assessed by revenue officials, styled thugyis, who are paid by a commission on their collections. The holdings average about 8 acres in extent.\n\nThe basis of the land revenue settlement has been:\u201420 per cent. of the gross produce, after many deductions, payable to Government in money at the rates of the price of grain in the circle within which the land is situated. Practically a lower percentage is taken. In the Districts of Rangoon, Bassein, and Henzada, and in the whole of the Tenasserim Division, each male engaged in taungya cultivation pays a tax of two shillings per annum; while in the Districts of Toung-gu and Promie, and generally in the Arakan Division, each family is assessed at\nthis rate. Among the hill tribes of Northern Arakan, each house pays four shillings per annum, which includes also capitation tax.\n\nSurvey, demarcation, and settlement are in the hands of a special department. The area dealt with by this department since its operations commenced in the Province, up to 1881\u201382, amounted to 5382 square miles, equal to 3,444,480 acres surveyed at a cost of \u00a3119,178, or 8\u00bdd. per acre. Of this total surveyed area, 3008 square miles, or 1,925,808 acres, have been brought under settlement at a total cost of \u00a323,854, or 3d. per acre. Total cost of survey and settlement, 11\u00bdd. per acre. The total revenue brought under settlement up to the end of 1881\u201382 was \u00a3162,173, showing a nett increase of nearly \u00a315,000, or 15 per cent., in the land revenue. The tracts under settlement operations have been, for the present, the Districts of Hanthawadi, Bassein, and Tharrawadi. The total number of tenant occupiers in the portions settled is 4031, holding 51,456 acres, at an average rent of 8s. per acre.\n\nWages and Prices.\u2014The local supply of labour is inadequate to the demands upon it, and considerable additions are made annually to the population during the harvest and rice shipping season by immigration from Upper Burma and from India. Few of the immigrants, however, bring their wives and children with them, and few settle permanently. To Pegu and Tenasserim, immigrants come by sea from the Madras coast, and from Calcutta in steamers. They are brought over by native captains of labour, who pay the fare of the coolies, receive them, and provide them with work. Into Arakan, immigrants come by land, chiefly from Chittagong. The Census of 1881 showed that in British Burma the number of persons of Indian birth was about 185,000, in addition to 316,000 persons born in the kingdom of Ava. Shans from the Burmese and Chinese Shan States, and other labourers from Upper Burma, come down by whole villages at a time during the harvest season, and return at its close. Some who settle as cultivators manage to get the women of their families brought after them, notwithstanding the stringent rules against emigration in the kingdom of Ava. This stream of yearly immigration into the Province is steadily increasing, and is now more than double what it was five years ago. The high rate of wages is still maintained. All the immigrants find employment, and the demand for outside labour is as great as ever.\n\nUnskilled labour is worth from 1s. to 1s. 6d. a day, and shipping coolies during the season earn up to 3s. It has been calculated that it takes as much money to construct 1 mile of road, or 100 cubic feet of masonry, in British Burma as it does to make 2 miles, or 800 cubic feet, in India. The large exportation of the food staple, and increased demands, have caused prices to rise very rapidly of late years. Previous to the annexation of the Province, the usual cost of paddy was Rs. 20 or\nRs. 25 (\u00a32 or \u00a32, 10s.) per 100 bushels; in 1878 (owing to the demand for grain during the famine in Southern India), it rose to \u00a313 per 100 bushels, the highest price realized; after that year it fell steadily, and in 1882 the price was \u00a35, 2s. per 100 bushels. The average prices of produce ruling in the Province at the end of 1881-82, per maund of 80 lbs., were\u2014for rice, 6s.; for uncleaned cotton, 20s.; for sugar, 17s.; for tobacco, 30s. 6d.; for oil-seeds, 10s. 9\u00bdd. Uncleaned cotton at the time of the annexation was obtainable at \u00a31 per 100 viss (365 lbs.); it now fetches more than four times that sum. The average price of a bullock has increased from Rs. 10 (\u00a31) to Rs. 60 (\u00a36). Bamboos which used to be sold at Rs. 2\u00bd (5s.) per 1000, now fetch about \u00a32, or Rs. 20.\n\nMeans of Communication.\u2014Next to labour, the most urgent want of the country is land communication. There are thousands of villages which are shut off from trade for at least eight months of the year by reason of the lack of roads. The needs of the Delta and the river tracts are in some measure supplied by the steamers and boats which ply on the rivers and tidal creeks, while the railways supply cheap means of transit to the plains which they traverse. But for want of a network of roads connecting the remoter towns and villages with the main lines of communication, the extension of cultivation and the prosperity of the country are retarded. During only four months of the year can the surplus produce of the country immediately adjoining the river tracts or plains be conveyed to the river or railway in carts; during the remainder of the year even this portion is quite shut off from the means of communication. No fewer than 8 of the 18 Districts of the Province are destitute of roads; they do not possess a single mile of metalled or bridged road outside the headquarter town. Road-making in Burma is slow work, owing to the want of labour and metal. No road-metal is available in many Districts except broken brick; and in a country with a heavy rainfall, a road of this material requires constant care and repairs after it is made, particularly if the traffic is at all heavy. There are only 1310 miles of made road in the whole Province, portions of which are impassable during the rains. There is abundance of waterway throughout the Irawadi delta all the year round. The Sittaung valley, however, has no such advantages.\n\nThere are now (1884) two lines of railway in the Province. One, following the valley of the Irawadi, called the 'Irawadi Valley State Railway,' 163 miles in length, connects the capital Rangoon with Prome. This line was opened in 1877, and the results have been most satisfactory. The other line, called the 'Rangoon and Sittaung Valley State Railway,' also 163 miles in length, connects the capital with the military station of Toung-gu. This line, now approaching completion,\nwill, it is expected, attract the whole of the trade with Karengni and the Shan States, and not only open up fertile districts as yet without means of communication, but also secure the frontier of Toung-gu, which in its present isolation is exposed to some peril. A navigable canal, about 40 miles in length, with locks, between the Sittaung and Irawadi rivers, has been, after some years in construction, now completed; it is intended to avoid the dangers of the bore in the Sittaung estuary. It carried 80,000 tons of boat traffic in 1881, besides timber rafts, and its completion has caused great extensions of cultivation in the tract through which it passes\u2014a tract previously water-logged and without means of communication. A similar canal has now been undertaken from Rangoon, through the rich township of Twantay, into Thongwa (Thun-khwa) District, between the Rangoon and Irawadi rivers. Proposals for the clearing of several old channels, the real highways of Burmese traffic, in order to make them again navigable, are also receiving attention. During 1881, two extra services of coasting steamers were, by the help of Government subsidies, established for the purpose of affording weekly communication, inwards and outwards, with the Districts of Kyauk-hpyu, Tavoy, and Mergui, and fortnightly with Sandoway.\n\nCommerce, Manufactures, etc.\u2014For centuries the seaboard of Burma has been visited by ships from many countries. Bassein, under its classic name of Kusimanagara, corrupted by the Talaings into Kutheim or Kusein, and by the Europeans who visited it into Cosmin, was a flourishing port in the 12th century. At a later period we find Arabs and other Asiatic races in constant communication with Arakan, Pegu, and Tenasserim. Towards the beginning of the second half of the 14th century, Muhammadan merchants carried on a brisk trade between Pegu and the countries east and west. The Arabs brought to Burma goods of European manufacture as well as the produce of their own country; and large sea-going boats from Mrohaung, the capital of the Arakan kingdom, visited the ports of Bengal.\n\nThe principal exports from Bassein and Pegu were gold, silver, rubies, sapphires (all jewels were excessively cheap, or as Frederick has it, sold 'at most vile and base prices'), long-pepper, lead, tin, lac, rice, and some sugar. The imports from Arabia and the Persian Gulf to Syriam (an ancient emporium of Burma, 3 miles from the mouth of the Pegu river), were woollen cloths, scarlet velvets, and opium; and from Madras and Bengal, 'painted cloth of Masulipatam and white cloth of Bengala, which is spent there (Pegu) in great quantity.' The trade of Malacca and places to the eastward was with Martaban, then a flourishing port of Tenasserim; the imports being porcelain from China, camphor from Borneo, and pepper from Achin. From Arakan, rice was the principal export, the imports being muslins, woollens, cutlery, piece-\ngoods, and glass and crockery ware. Tenasserim exported tin largely. The continual wars between the Burmese and Siamese ruined the trade of the south; and on the conquest of Arakan by the former in 1784, commerce was so hampered by vexatious restrictions and prohibitions that it almost ceased.\n\nAfter the cession of the country to the British, Akyab rapidly rose in importance, and the inland trade with Upper Burma across the mountains increased to such an extent that it competed seriously with the sea-borne trade at Bassein and Rangoon. Owing to the facilities for inland communication by the creeks, Akyab is and will remain the real port of Arakan. The trade of Tenasserim also, when the British came into possession, was at a very low ebb. The country, however, had extensive teak forests, which led to the foundation of the town of Maulmain, where ship-building could be extensively carried on. The favourable situation of this town at the mouth of the Salwin, where it is joined by two other tributaries, all three rivers tapping countries exceedingly rich in teak, has enormously developed the timber trade. In 1836-37, the exports from Maulmain consisted almost entirely of teak timber, which realized a revenue of \u00a32080; five years later it was \u00a35418. In 1851-52 it had risen to \u00a37163. In 1860-61, the total value of the imports at Maulmain was \u00a3530,234, and of the exports \u00a3446,371, the total duty realized being \u00a310,048, and the aggregate tonnage of vessels calling at and leaving the port in the same year being 155,113 tons. Ship-building, which during the period of its greatest activity, from 1837 to 1858, was principally for European owners, has since almost entirely ceased, in consequence of the rise in price of materials and labour. In 1840, the price of teak was Rs. 25 (\u00a32, 10s.) a ton, in 1881-82 it was Rs. 63 (\u00a36, 6s.); unskilled labour rose from 14s. to 30s. a month, and skilled labour from 30s. to \u00a35.\n\nThe commercial prosperity of British Burma has more than kept pace with its rapidly increasing population. Since 1855, the external trade of the Province has risen from \u00a35,000,000 to \u00a321,000,000 in 1881-82, as the following figures show. Value of sea-borne trade in 1881-82, imports \u00a38,077,000, exports \u00a39,288,000; value of land-frontier trade, imports \u00a32,018,000, exports \u00a31,765,000; total value, imports \u00a310,095,000, exports \u00a311,053,000, aggregating a total of \u00a321,148,000. Rangoon absorbs about 90 per cent. of the whole of the foreign import trade, and about 60 per cent. of the foreign export trade. The trade, especially the rice traffic to Europe, is employing steamers more largely every year. The Indian craft and junks, which used to do much of the trade along the coast, to India on the one side and to the Straits Settlements on the other, are decreasing before the competition of the coasting steamers, of which there are now three or four lines, besides the mail steamers of the British India Company. The\nservice done for the Province by these steamers is very great. The sea-\nborne trade at the eight different ports of the Province during 1881-82 was\ncarried on in 918 steamers and 850 sailing vessels, 'entered' and\n'cleared,' with a registered tonnage of 1,492,584 tons.\n\nThe chief items of the export trade are rice, timber, cutch (a resinous\ngum used for dyeing and other purposes in Europe and America), hides,\npetroleum, and precious stones. It is the rice produce and the rice\nexports that have made and that maintain the prosperity of British\nBurma. In 1880-81, the Province sent away no fewer than 892,262\ntons of rice, of which Upper Burmah took 6924 tons. The declared\nvalues of three items of export alone for the same year, were\u2014\nrice, \u00a35,655,000; teak timber, \u00a31,020,000; and cutch, \u00a3468,000.\nIn 1881-82, the value of the rice exported was \u00a35,379,556. The chief\nimports are piece-goods, silk, cotton, and wool, cotton twist, gunny-bags,\nbetel-nuts, liquors, tobacco, iron, mill machinery, and sugar. Among\nthe imports the value of cotton yarn, cotton goods, silk and woollen\ngoods, and apparel, in 1880-81 reached \u00a33,339,000.\n\nThe most important industry in British Burma is carried on by\nthe rice-mills, which free the rice from the husk and prepare it for\nthe European, American, and Chinese markets. It is the enterprise\nand the skill of the mill-owners that have increased the rice trade of\nBurma. At the present time, Burmese rice is sent direct from the mills\nto England, Italy, Austria, Germany, Holland, France, Brazil, the\nStraits, China, and the Mauritius. It seems to be making its way into\nnew fields. A recent report mentioned that Burmese rice had reached\nIceland; and a merchant just returned from Europe reported that\nin Northern Germany the Burmese grain is coming into use as an\narticle of food among the poorer classes. The rice-mills ensure a ready\nmarket and a full price for all the surplus paddy (rice in husk) which\nany farmer can send by boat or rail to a rice port, and they provide\ncargoes for the steamers and sailing vessels which flock to Burmese ports.\nThere are now 49 rice-mills at work in Burma, of which 28 are at\nRangoon, and seven at each of the other rice ports, namely, Maulmain,\nAkyab, and Bassein. Twenty of the Rangoon mills can prepare white rice\nfit for European consumption; the remainder prepare cargo rice, which\nhas again to be passed through cleaning mills in London, Liverpool,\nHamburgh, or Bremen. White rice cannot stand the long voyage\nround the Cape, but it bears the shorter journey through the Suez Canal\nto Europe well. There are about 20 steam timber saw-mills at Rangoon,\nMaulmain, Tavoy, and Shwe-gyin. Of the total number of mills in the\ncountry, 41 rice-mills and 10 timber saw-mills are owned by European\nmerchants, 3 rice-mills and 4 saw-mills by Chinese, two of each by\nBurmese, one rice-mill by P\u00e1rsis, one saw-mill by the King of Ava, and\ntwo of each by natives of India.\nNext to occupations connected with the preparation of rice for the market, the most important industry is weaving. At Prome, Shwe-daung, Yand\u00fan, and other towns in the Irawadi valley, there used to be a large production of silk *patsoes*, *tameins*, and *gaungbaungs* (garment pieces worn by Burmese men and women). But the power-looms of Europe are now sending large supplies of these fabrics woven on Burmese models. These undersell the local fabrics, and the latter are now produced in smaller quantity. The native cloths are 30 per cent dearer, but stronger and more durable, both in texture and in colour, than the imported fabrics. Almost every Burmese man and woman has one or more of these silk garment pieces to be worn on festivals, or oftener if the owner can afford it. Efforts are being made to popularize improved forms of looms and shuttles brought from England in 1880, and their use is being taught in several Karen schools.\n\nThe manufacture of earthenware is carried on in most parts of the Province, and considerable artistic success has been attained in the potteries at Shwe-gyin and Bassein. Drinking vessels, boxes and other articles of lacquer ware are largely made everywhere, and every Burmese monk has two or three large lacquer vessels for collecting daily contributions of food from his disciples. The groundwork of these articles consists of very fine bamboo wickerwork, on which are overlaid coats of lacquer, the chief ingredient in which is the oil or resin from the *thitsi* tree. Little or no real lac is used in the Burmese ware. The Burmese exhibit proficiency in the art of wood-carving; their temples, monasteries, and sometimes their dwelling-houses are ornamented with a profusion of quaint and delicate designs, and skilful master-carvers in wood are much esteemed. Formerly the carvers devoted their labours almost entirely to the ornamentation of religious edifices, but of late years they have shown themselves ready to comply with the demand which has sprung up among Europeans for specimens of their handiwork.\n\nBoat-building, cart-making, mat-weaving, torch-making, the manufacture of paper, umbrella-making, ivory-carving, and stone-cutting are also branches of industry among the Burmese. Ironsmiths are found in almost every village, but their skill is limited. In iron the manufacture of *tees* for pagodas, and in brass the casting of bells and of images of Gautama, may be mentioned. Quaint, beautiful gold and silver work is everywhere made. *Repouss\u00e9* silver bowls are to be found in every monastery and in every respectable Burman\u2019s house. Enamelling on silver, or the manufacture of what is known as viello work, is also practised in Shwe-gyin and Thayet-myo Districts. As a rule, Burmans of all classes invest their savings in gold and silver ornaments. The refining and preparation of cutch for the home market in Prome and Thayet-myo Districts afford employment to a large number of people.\nThe manufacture of paper from bamboos is also to be tried, and if successful an important new industry will soon grow up.\n\nThe condiment known as nga-pi (from nga, 'fish,' and pi, 'to be pressed'), made from fish, is universally used by Burmans and Talaings throughout British and Upper Burma. It is of three kinds\u2014nga-pi-gaung, or whole fish salted; taungtha nga-pi, 'fish paste,' and seinse nga-pi, or 'raw eaten,' because it is eaten uncooked; in Arakan this last is known as nga-pi nyin, and in Tavoy and Mergui as gwe; by Europeans it is called balachong, the name given to it in the Straits of Malacca. Salt is manufactured all round the coast, but the importation of cheap salt from England has seriously affected the manufacture. The western provinces of China, and the Kakhyen and Shan States between China and Ava, are to a considerable extent dependent on British Burma for salt, and large quantities are sent to Bhamo. In 1881-82, 489,776 maunds of salt were sold at Rangoon for Upper Burma, of which 332,216 maunds, valued at \u00a324,921, were exported to that region.\n\nThe land frontier trade is conducted mainly by the Irawadi route, and nearly all the traffic is carried by the steamers of the Irawadi flotilla. This Company began business in 1868 by taking over two or three old Government steamers and flats. They now possess 30 steamers and 44 flats, and send two or more steamers with flats to Mandalay twice a week, and a steamer once a fortnight, or oftener if need be, to Bhamo, which place is within 4 days' journey of the southwest frontier of China. Their steamers and flats also ply on the creeks and rivers of the Pegu delta. The Company receives subsidies aggregating in all \u00a312,000 a year. The service they do to the Province is immense, as they carry yearly between British and Independent Burma goods to the value of about 3\u00bd millions sterling, besides about 50,000 passengers\u2014over and above the large traffic they do in purely British waters. Although they have practically a monopoly of the Irawadi traffic, their charges are not excessive; for instance, they carry salt cargoes from Rangoon to Bhamo, a distance of over 750 miles up stream, for Rs. 11 (\u00a31, 2s.) per ton. Three or four steamers belonging to the King of Burma also ply on the river, but get little freight, although the trade to Mandalay is entirely in the hands of Chinese and Musalm\u00e1n merchants. The only other steamers plying on the rivers in Burma are small craft belonging to Chinese and Burmese merchants, which run from Rangoon rather irregularly to Yand\u00fan and Pegu. Negotiations have been completed with a Maulmain firm to run small steamers for a subsidy on the Salwin and Damdami rivers to important trading towns outside Maulmain.\n\nThe value of the inland trade of British Burma, by 3 river and 17 land routes, aggregated in 1881-82, \u00a33,783,375; the imports amounting to\n\u00a32,018,529, and the exports to \u00a31,764,846. In 1880-81, the aggregate value of the imports and exports was \u00a34,182,525. A considerable quantity of teak timber from Upper Burma and the semi-independent States between Siam and Ava enters British territory between the Sittaung and Salwin rivers. Very little other merchandise enters or leaves British Burma by either of these rivers, which are hardly navigable beyond the frontier. The trade on the Salwin consists entirely of timber floated down from the forests bordering that river and the Thounghin, which joins it on the British frontier. A certain proportion of the inland trade is carried on pack-bullocks, on elephants, and on men's backs, across the borders of Thayet-myo, Kyauk-hpyu, Tavoy, Amherst, and Toung-gu Districts, and by a few of these Districts cattle and ponies are imported. Three-fourths of the whole inland trade is registered on the Irawadi route. The Mandalay trade, as the traffic with and through Upper Burma is called, is entirely in the hands of Chinese, Muhammadan, and Burmese merchants. With the exception of one English firm, who have taken the cutch monopoly, and two or three timber contractors, Europeans have no direct dealings with Mandalay, though they sell to and buy from the Chinese and native firms which deal with that place. The trade across the land frontier of British Burma is, according to the latest published reports, nearly one-half of the whole traffic that crosses the land frontier of continental India, from Karachi on the west to Chittagong on the east. But the Mandalay trade would expand indefinitely, if only a safe road existed between Bhamo and the confines of Western China. The flotilla steamers reach Bhamo from Rangoon in 15 or 20 days. For the millions of Chinese in Yunan and Southern Szechuen, the Irawadi and Bhamo route would perhaps be the best trade route with Europe.\n\nMr. Colquhoun, an engineer officer of Burma, made in 1881 a most enterprising journey from Canton through the Chinese provinces of Kwantung, Kwangsi, and Southern Yunan to Esmau on the Cambodia river. Thence he had intended to make his way through the Shan States to Zimmeh, from which there is a good route to Maulmain. But at Esmau he was compelled to return northwards up the valley of the Cambodia river for about 220 miles to Talifu in Western Yunan; whence he came to Rangoon by way of Bhamo and Mandalay. The Cambodia valley, north of Esmau, was found to be rich and studded with populous cities, and it had not been previously visited by Europeans. Esmau is about 420 miles from the highest navigable point on the Salwin river, and about 480 miles from Maulmain. For the greater part of this distance the route passes over hilly, sparsely-peopled country, where a wheeled vehicle has hardly been seen; and the peaks between Esmau and British territory rarely reach 6000 feet in height, while the passes probably range from 2000 to 4000 feet. The\nrival route by the Irawadi valley to Talifu has the advantage of steamer carriage (1800 miles) to Bhamo, which is about 220 miles from Talifu; to this place the route from Bhamo is mountainous, and two passes, one of which is 3700 feet high, have to be crossed. If Talifu is to be the object of the two trade routes, the Zimmeh route is shorter by 320 miles than the route by the Irawadi valley, and perhaps safer, as the road beyond Bhamo is infested by Kakhyen tribes who levy blackmail on caravans and often close the road entirely. Between Esmau and the British frontier near Maulmain lie a number of petty Shan States, which are supposed to owe allegiance, some to China, some to Bankok, and some to Ava.\n\nMines and Quarries.\u2014The geological structure of Burma comprises three sections\u2014western, middle, and eastern, nearly corresponding to the divisions of Arakan, Pegu, and Tenasserim. The rocks of Arakan belong to the secondary series, Pegu is tertiary, while Tenasserim is primary. The economic products of the western Division are mineral oil (petroleum), limestone, and coal. The middle or Pegu Division produces laterite. Iron-ore and manganese have also been found in small quantities. The eastern division has not been much explored; coal, limestone, tin, lead, gold, antimony, and graphite have been found in various quantities at different places. Mineral oil or petroleum is found principally in Kyauk-hpyu, the Boronga islands, and Thayet-myo. It differs from the oil found in Upper Burma in containing little solid paraffin, and in being more volatile. It is also found at various places on the eastern slopes of the Arakan Hills. The oil seems to be drawn from a stratum of carbonaceous shale and coal which crops up in the spurs of the Arakan Yoma Hills. Prospecting for oil has been actively carried on by the Boronga Oil-refining Company on the Boronga islands off Akyab, and on the Ramri island of Kyauk-hpyu District. A licence has been granted to the Company; and their operations promise to be on the whole successful, as a large sum of money has been laid out on plant and machinery, and experts have been brought from Europe and America to work the enterprise. The yield of oil from the wells on the Borongas is not so plentiful as was expected, but the yield in the Mimbyin field in Ramri is increasing.\n\nCoal is found in the Arakan Yoma, both in British Burma and beyond the frontier. The deposits in British Burma are generally thin and broken; but a seam 6 feet thick, with another 2 feet thick underlying it, occurs on a tributary of the Okepo river, 35 miles from Henzada. The area of this tract has not yet been ascertained. At Insein, at a depth of 200 feet, a thin seam, about 9 inches thick, of lignite has been found. The Myawoung localities have also been explored, with encouraging results, the coal specimens proving of fair quality. Operations to ascertain the coal-bearing strata of Henzada\nDistrict are in progress. *Limestone* occurs in isolated patches along the Arakan Hills from Thayet-myo to Bassein, and in Tenasserim it forms a range of hills. The best lime is brought from a place called Kyauktalone (monolith) near Maulmain. *Tin* is found at Maliwun, where it is picked from the beds of streams by Chinese. An English firm made an exploration of this locality some years ago, but discovered that there was not enough tin to repay European capital and labour. The recent abolition of the export duty is said to have stimulated the production of the metal in Southern Tenasserim. *Gold* is found in small quantities at Shwe-gyin, once noted for its gold diggings, which are now exhausted. A search made for the quartz reefs, from which the gold in the river is derived, was unsuccessful. There is lead in Shwe-gyin District which has drawn the attention of capitalists; and antimony is found in the Toungwaing Hills at Maulmain, where it occurs disseminated in small grains through the rocks.\n\n*Forests.*\u2014At least 50,000 square miles of hill, valley, and plain in British Burma are covered with forests and woods of one kind or another. These forests yield ample supplies of timber, bamboos and other products to the people of the country. But to the world outside Burma, the forests are chiefly known from the teak timber and the cutch (a dye and tannin obtained by boiling chipped wood of the *Acacia catechu*) which they produce. Teak has been exported for many years from Rangoon (the value in 1805 was \u00a346,115), but in the early periods the forests in Tenasserim and the Shan States were but little worked. After the cession to the British of Arakan and Tenasserim, the forests were examined, and the Government directed that they should be reserved as State property. Although the price of teak has risen 50 per cent., there has been no decrease in the demand. The average annual yield of teak timber from Burma, for the five years ending 1880\u201381, was about 227,000 tons, of which 135,000 tons, worth about \u00a3470,000, were exported. In 1881\u201382, the out-turn of teak was 31,246 tons from Government forests, and the imports from foreign territory 154,290 tons, total 185,536 tons; the exports from Rangoon and Maulmain being returned at 133,751 tons. During the five years ending 1881\u201382, 13 per cent. of the total quantity was yielded by forests in British territory, and 87 per cent. by forests beyond the frontier; and of the total out-turn 23 per cent. was used in the country itself, while the remainder was exported. On the average, it may be stated that one-fifth of the present teak supply is from forests in British Burma, and four-fifths from trans-frontier forests situated on the upper waters of the Salwin, Sittaung, and Irawadi rivers. Improvements in water communication will probably open out fresh sources of teak supply in the upper valleys of the Siam and Cambodia rivers\u2014localities which have not yet been tapped.\n\nThe Government revenue derived from forests in British Burma for\n1881-82 was \u00a3223,180, as compared with \u00a377,240 in 1871-72. The expenditure in 1881-82 was \u00a3115,022, showing a surplus of \u00a3108,158. There seems little chance that the demand for teak will abate; its employment for a variety of purposes in Europe and other countries is still steadily extending. In the trans-frontier forests there has hitherto been much waste, and no attempt at conservancy. It has become necessary, therefore, in view of the increasing demand for teak, that the forests of British Burma should be systematically conserved. The first step in this direction was to protect from fire and from the axes of the jungle tribes the best teak-producing areas. The Karens and other hill tribes often prefer a teak forest for their taungyas or nomadic cultivation. As already explained, the nomadic cultivator cuts down the forest on three to five acres early in the year, burns the timber and brushwood when dry, sows mixed crops in the ashes, and reaps them in the cold season. The following spring he goes on to another plot of forest, and treats that in the same way. Meanwhile bamboos and underwood grow up on the plot he has abandoned. After a period of seven to fourteen years he returns to his first clearing, or to one of his neighbours', and begins the process over again; or he goes off to another valley and cuts fresh taungyas there, returning after 20 or 25 years to his old ground. It is not only the axe of the Karens that destroys the teak forests. The fires which they kindle at the season when everything is driest, spread far and wide, and kill the trees and saplings for many miles round a single Karen hamlet. To prevent this yearly destruction of valuable forests is the chief aim of the forest officials, and already 3274 square miles of teak-producing forests have been selected and demarcated as reserves, at a total expenditure up to 1881-82 of \u00a37771.\n\nThe Karens and other hill tribes dislike forest reservation, partly because it brings some hardships, but chiefly because it puts restraint on the boundless licence they have been wont to enjoy. The attitude of these people is thus described by the Pegu conservator. He says:\n\n'The Karens themselves say that once they were like jungle-fowl, hiding where they liked, scratching the earth here and there, and putting in a grain of rice, and eating what came of it if the nats (i.e. spirits) permitted, but that now the Forest Department put them into boundaries here and boundaries there, and that they feel like pigs in a pen. But after a certain time has elapsed, they rarely deny that their latter state is preferable to their former, more especially in or near fire-traced reserves, where work is constantly obtainable. With the careful way in which inquiries are made and privileges and rights granted, we have a right to expect such favourable results.' This, it must be remembered, is the statement of a forest officer, who naturally thinks well of his own Department. It would really appear, however, that owing to the large surplus of available land, forest conservation does not press so hard upon the people of\nBurma as it does in some of the densely-crowded Districts of the Indian peninsula. Although the area of the reserves is now so large, there were only two breaches of the rules and no prosecutions in the Tenasserim, and only nine prosecutions in the Pegu Circle. Eventually these reserves will cover an area of some 4000 square miles, out of which at least 2500 square miles will, within the next forty years, yield annually an average of about 10 cubic feet to the acre, or 128 tons of teak per square mile. At this rate the yield of the reserves ought to reach 320,000 tons per annum.\n\nIn addition to the protection of the reserves, small areas are regularly planted with teak each year by the hill tribes in their taungyas, at a cost of from Rs. 8 (16s.) to Rs. 14 (28s.) per each acre planted; and up to 1881-82 no less than 8000 acres were covered with teak plantations, at a cost of \u00a335,762, or \u00a34, 12s. per acre. The average number of seedlings per acre is 600. These plantations are being extended at the rate of 1200 acres a year, and it is believed that they ought to be yielding mature teak about 80 years hence. It has been calculated that 120,000 acres of plantation should yield at least 1000 tons of teak a year, but it has still to be proved how far mature teak will come to perfection in plantations. Sixty or seventy years hence, if teak continues to be in demand, the forest reserves of British Burma ought to yield a revenue of \u00a3500,000 a year.\n\nAlthough teak is the most valuable produce of the Burmese forests, there are many other kinds of valuable timber with which the people build their houses. The iron wood (pyin-gado) yields large and durable house-posts, railway sleepers, and piles for timber bridges, while other varieties of trees furnish good scantlings and planks. As teak gets dearer, these woods are coming into more general use, and something has been done to introduce the more handsome Burmese woods into the furniture trade of Europe.\n\nThe experimental cultivation of various exotics has been tried at Mergui and Tharrawadi, with success. At Thandaung, some miles to the north of Toung-gu, there are about 54,000 plants of cinchona, which, however, do not thrive so well as could be wished. The cultivation of tea and coffee at Thandaung, undertaken recently as an experiment, promises to be successful, as the plants of both are growing well.\n\nThe interior Districts of the Tenasserim Division, owing to their sparse population and the absence of communication, still remain for the most part a terra incognita. Hundreds of square miles of waste lands, covered with valuable timber, grass, and bamboos, here await the enterprising pioneers of industries, who have made Ceylon, Assam, and other parts of India the centres of a flourishing commerce. Almost all the products that have gained for the Straits a reputation grow in these tracts. For tea, coffee, and cinchona, the conditions of success are said to be as good as in Ceylon, Coorg, or Assam. On the other hand,\nit is stated that the excessive rainfall counteracts the favourable conditions of situation and climate. Repeated experiments can alone settle the commercial success or failure of these crops in Tenasserim. Grants of waste land have been announced as available in lots ranging from 100 to 1200 acres, under the Burma Land Act of 1876, for the planting of tea, cinchona, coffee, and spices in Tavoy District, at altitudes varying from 100 to 6800 feet above the sea. The region of waste land to be granted lies between the 13th and 14th parallels of north latitude, where the rainfall ranges from 190 to 220 inches a year. The lands are chiefly within 30 to 50 miles of the steamer station of Thayetchaung on the Tavoy river; and mail steamers ply between that station and Maulmain or Rangoon, once a week, inwards and outwards. A grantee must bring under cultivation one-third of his allotment within 12 years from the date of obtaining his grant. The Government reserve their right to all minerals and metals found upon the land.\n\n**Statement of the Revenue and Expenditure (Imperial, Local and Municipal) of the Province of British Burma for the Year 1881-82.**\n\n| Revenue | Expenditure |\n|---------|-------------|\n| Land Revenue,\u00b9 | \u00a31,052,261 |\n| Forests | 223,180 |\n| Excise | 224,986 |\n| Provincial rates | 78,121 |\n| Customs | 648,657 |\n| Salt, import duty | 14,780 |\n| Salt, excise duty | 4,918 |\n| Opium | 30,314 |\n| Stamps | 82,153 |\n| Registration | 1,606 |\n| Post-office | 23 |\n| Minor departments | 358 |\n| Law and justice | 53,131 |\n| Police | 21,888 |\n| Marine | 17,681 |\n| Education | 4,794 |\n| Medical | 1,460 |\n| Stationery and printing | 550 |\n| Interest | 1,090 |\n| Superannuations | 512 |\n| Miscellaneous | 15,329 |\n| Railways | 152,932 |\n| Irrigation and navigation | 3,196 |\n| Other public works | 16,760 |\n| Gain by exchange | 794 |\n| Contributions | 83,525 |\n| Excluded local funds | 130,342 |\n| Municipalities | 130,149 |\n| **Total** | **\u00a32,995,400** |\n\n| Refunds and drawbacks | \u00a320,712 |\n| Charges on collection, including interest for productive public works | 487,142 |\n| Interest on service funds, etc., | 921 |\n| Post-office | 5,918 |\n| Administration | 42,018 |\n| Minor departments | 9,470 |\n| Law and justice | 147,353 |\n| Police | 101,728 |\n| Marine | 40,371 |\n| Education | 32,403 |\n| Ecclesiastical | 5,397 |\n| Medical services | 22,340 |\n| Stationery and printing | 15,006 |\n| Political | 5,875 |\n| Allowances, furlough, etc. | 970 |\n| Superannuations | 14,074 |\n| Miscellaneous | 14,434 |\n| Irrigation and navigation | 40,789 |\n| Other public works | 387,416 |\n| Loss by exchange | 28 |\n| Contributions | 83,525 |\n| Excluded local funds | 120,377 |\n| Municipalities | 223,203 |\n| **Total** | **\u00a31,930,070** |\n\n\u00b9 Including capitation tax, which to some extent takes the place of land revenue.\nRevenue, etc.\u2014The statistics given in the foregoing pages illustrate the remarkable progress made by the Province since it came under British administration. Its growing prosperity is not less strikingly shown by the figures of the preceding table. The revenue of Arakan expanded between 1826 and 1855 from \u00a323,225 to \u00a3127,729; while that of Tenasserim rose from \u00a32676 in 1829 (three years after its annexation) to \u00a383,300 in 1855. Between 1855 and 1882, the revenue of the whole Province has increased from about a million sterling to nearly three millions.\n\nThe proportion of gross revenue contributed by each Division of British Burma is\u2014from Arakan, 13'53 per cent.; from Pegu, 45'96; from Irawadi, 25'37; and from Tenasserim, 15'14; and the average incidence of taxation per head of population is 16s. The main sources of imperial income are land, customs, excise, and forests. Speaking roughly, the land-tax furnishes more than one-third of the total revenue, customs about one-fifth, and excise and forests in nearly equal proportions more than one-tenth. Capitation tax and fishery rents form special features of the administration. The former is levied on the male population between the ages of eighteen and sixty, at the rate of 10s. a head for married men, and half that amount for bachelors. Exceptions are made in favour of religious and other teachers, Government servants, all persons unable to earn their own living, and all immigrants for the first five years. Traditional usage affords the principal argument for maintaining this old-fashioned impost. The gross amount it realized in 1881-82 was \u00a3295,670, levied on 732,988 persons. Land-rate in lieu of capitation tax is imposed in the towns of Akyab, Kyauk-hpyu, Rangoon, Prome, Bassein, Thayet-myo, and Toung-gu. The revenue demand on account of fisheries in 1881-82 amounted to \u00a3133,774. The sea-fishing is mainly in the hands of natives of India; and the fishermen are a class by themselves, and as a body not in very good repute. There is no general salt-tax in Burma as in India, and the land-tax is kept very low.\n\nAdministrative Statistics.\u2014There are at present 153 Courts of Law in the Province, besides a Judicial Commissioner and a Recorder at Rangoon. The two last, when sitting together, exercise the powers of a supreme appellate tribunal. There are also unpaid \u2018honorary\u2019 magistrates; 155 courts have both civil and criminal jurisdiction. The subordinate courts are almost entirely presided over by native officials. In criminal work during the year 1881, there were 30,353 cases reported, and 27,312 persons convicted out of 41,819 put on trial. The total of prisoners in the 14 jails of the Province was 16,294, only 2'8 per cent. of whom were women. The daily average jail population was 4726; the total expenditure, \u00a333,533; and the average net cost per head, \u00a35, 3s. od. The police force of the Province during the year 1881 consisted of\n7131 officers and men; equivalent to one policeman to every 104 square miles, or to every 524 of population; the total cost was \u00a3168,693.\n\nThe Education of the people is under the care of a special department. It is chiefly conducted through the agency of the indigenous lay and monastic schools already described, the ph\u00fbngy\u00eds or monastic order being nearly all engaged in teaching. Direct Government effort is mainly confined to inspection and higher instruction. Missionary schools are also liberally aided by the State. In the year 1880, the number of seminaries under State control or inspection aggregated 3012, and the pupils, 79,270. Of these, 2645 were monastic schools attended by 65,320 pupils. The above figures are exclusive of the large number of uninspected monastic schools, for which no statistics are available. But according to the Census of 1880, there were in that year 215,237 boys and 31,057 girls receiving instruction of some sort in the Province, besides 701,828 males and 31,740 females able to read and write, but not under instruction; proportion of males able to read and write, 46\u00b705 per cent. of the male population, and of females, 3\u00b76 per cent. of the female population.\n\nThere is a Port Fund at each of the principal ports, Rangoon, Bassein, Maulmain, and Akyab, the aggregate income of which for 1881\u201382 amounted to \u00a374,023. The effective strength of the troops of all arms stationed in the Province at the end of March 1882, was 5106 officers and men. There were 21 printing-presses at work in the Province. The only two institutions of note are the Agri-Horticultural Society and the Rangoon Literary Society. Situated within the gardens of the former is the Phayre Museum.\n\nThere are 7 Municipalities\u2014Rangoon, Maulmain, Akyab, Bassein, Henzada, Prome, and Toung-gu. Rangoon has a population double, and a revenue four-fold, that of any other. Municipal institutions have been now some eight years in existence, and, as a rule, are working favourably. The total income of the above 7 municipalities during 1881\u201382 was \u00a3248,452, of which \u00a3104,561 came from loans, \u00a390,817 from local taxation, and \u00a315,233 from grants from provincial funds. The incidence of municipal taxation per head of the town population ranges from 3s. 4\u00bdd. in Rangoon to 5s. 10d. in Akyab.\n\nMedical Aspects, Climate, etc.\u2014The climate of British Burma is moderate and equable. Notwithstanding the heavy rainfall, the health of European troops stationed in the Province, which was very bad during the earlier years of occupation, is now better, on the average, than in India proper. The great drawback to life in British Burma is the want of a sanitarium where Europeans can recruit their strength. Many proposals have been made to this end, and several sites have been suggested on the high mountain ranges of the Province; but however pleasant they were found in the summer, they have had to be\nabandoned in the rains, so incredibly rapid is the growth of vegetation at this season. Attempts have also been made to establish seaside sanitariums\u2014at Dalhousie, near the mouth of the Bassein river, and at Amherst, near the mouth of the Salwin river\u2014but without success. Another site was tried at Thadaung-gyi, a hill 3900 to 4500 feet above the sea, and within 23 miles of Toung-gu, to which place the railway will probably be opened in 1884. Although this place is unsuited to Europeans by reason of the constant rain and mist, it is still undergoing trial. Another higher ridge called Nattaung, about 70 miles from Toung-gu, has been suggested, and two sites from 6000 to 7000 feet above sea-level among the ranges behind Maulmain; but these three are difficult of access. The Provincial death-rate in 1881 was, according to the District returns, slightly over 16 per 1000. Such returns do not, however, stand the test of statistical criticism, although the superior physique, domestic comfort, and architectural contrivances of the people would in some measure account for a low figure. The mortality among the jail population is 45.10 per 1000. The death-rate of children under one year of age is 18 per cent. of the total deaths of all ages.\n\nIn the year 1882, meteorological observations were taken at 19 stations in the Province. The rainfall in British Burma is very large, and varies from a total of 211 inches in the year at Kyauk-hpyu to 43 at Prome, the general average being about 127 inches. The great Indian rain-belt, stretching south from the Himalayas along the Bay of Bengal, includes all the seaboard and delta of the Province, but the more inland stations are comparatively dry. The greatest heat was during March, April, and May. It ranged from 109\u00b0 F. at Thayet-myo to 89\u00b0 at Kyauk-hpyu. The lowest minimum at 10 A.M., viz. 55\u00b0, occurred at Toung-gu in January. The thermometric mean range was inconsiderable, varying from 25\u00b0 at Thayet-myo to 14\u00b0 at Tavoy.\n\nFever and bowel complaints are the only forms of physical ailment which a Burman recognises, and he groups under the former head all that are manifestly not assignable to the latter. This faulty diagnosis explains the extraordinary proportion of deaths from fever, which are shown in the returns as constituting no fewer than 47 per cent. of the total mortality. As a fact, severe malarial poisoning is not common, the chief fevers being febricula and quotidian intermittent. Cholera and small-pox occur as occasional epidemics, the mortality from the former in 1881 being 1.42 per 1000, and from the latter .48. Leprosy is rare. There were only 2589 lepers at the time of the last Census, constituting 0.69 per 1000 of the population. The Burmese very generally resort to inoculation; but vaccination is being gradually introduced by Government agency, and a little over 10 per 1000 of the population were successfully vaccinated in 1881.\nCattle-disease has of late years assumed formidable proportions. Increase of work and decrease of pasturage, together with insufficient food during the hot season, cause great ravages among the live stock. In 1876, 60,000 head of cattle perished in the Arakan Division; and there was a decrease of 14,000 head in a single District. Since then there has not been any serious epidemic. The majority of cases were pure rinderpest, although dysentery, hoven, and foot-and-mouth disease often occur. In 1874, a school was established at Rangoon, where Burmese pupils are specially instructed in veterinary science.\n\nBurma, Independent.\u2014A native kingdom beyond the mountainous eastern frontier of Bengal, stretching eastwards towards China, and southwards to British Burma. Independent Burma lies outside of British India, but some account of it may be useful to those who consult this book. It should, however, be clearly understood that no official authority attaches to the present article, which is compiled for the most part from materials already before the public. For the historical section I am largely indebted to the article in the Encyclopaedia Britannica, and I beg to express my obligations to the author and the publishers for permission to use that article.\n\nIndependent Burma was formerly of very great extent, but its limits have been contracted by British conquest. On the west, the Burmese empire is now bounded by the British Province of Arakan, surrendered to us in 1826, the petty States of Hill Tipperah and Manipur, and the British Province of Assam, from which it is separated by lofty ridges of mountains; on the south by British Burma, acquired by us in 1853; on the north by Assam and Tibet; and on the east by China and the Shan States. Its limits extend from 19\u00b0 30' to about 27\u00b0 15' N. lat., and from about 93\u00b0 52' to 100\u00b0 40' E. long., with an estimated area of about 190,000 square miles.\n\nThe Burmese territory is watered by three great streams, namely, the Irawadi and the Kyeng-dweng, which unite their courses at 21\u00b0 50' N. lat., and the Salwin. The first two rivers have their sources somewhere in the northern chain of mountains in the interior, one head stream of the Irawadi probably coming from Tibet; and the Salwin has its source farther to the east in Tibet. The Myit-nge, a large affluent of the Irawadi, drains the Shan States to the east of the capital; the Shweley, another large affluent rising in Yunan, flows south of Bhamo. Except the two last, which have a westerly direction, they all run in a southerly course to the Indian Ocean. Another large stream, the Nam-Kathe or Manipur river, drains the Lushai and Manipur Hills, and flows into the Kyeng-dweng. The Irawadi and Salwin, in the lower part of their course, overflow the flat country below their banks during the season of the rains, and higher up force their way through magnificent defiles. The former is navigable a considerable distance above\nBhamo; but the latter is practically useless as a means of communication, owing to the frequent obstacles in its channel. The Burmese empire with its present limits contains no maritime districts, and only isolated tracts of alluvial plain; it is in the main an upland territory, bounded at its southern extremity by a frontier line at the distance of about 200 miles from the mouths of the Irawadi, in $19^\\circ 30'$ N. lat. From this point the country begins to rise, and thence for about 300 miles farther, it contains much rolling country intersected by occasional hill ranges; beyond, all is wild and mountainous.\n\n**Natural Products.**\u2014Although inferior in point of fertility to the low-lying tracts of British Burma, the upland country is far from unproductive. The chief crops are rice (of which the Burmese count 102 different sorts), maize, millet, wheat, various pulses, tobacco, cotton, sesamum, mustard, and indigo. The sugar-cane appears to have been long known to the Burmese; but, though the climate and soil are extremely favourable, it is not generally cultivated. A cheap and coarse sugar is obtained from the juice of the Palmyra palm, which abounds in the tract south of the capital. The cocoa-nut and areca palms are not common. The tea-plant, which is indigenous, is cultivated in the hills by some of the mountain tribes at the distance of about five days' journey, and by others in still greater perfection at the distance of about ten days' journey from Mandalay. It seems, however, to be another plant, probably the *Eleoedendron persicum*, which furnishes the principal ingredient in the *hilapit*, or pickled tea, which forms a favourite Burmese delicacy and is an essential accompaniment to every social or ceremonial incident. Cotton is grown in every part of the kingdom and its dependencies, but chiefly in the dry lands and climate of the Upper Provinces. Indigo is indigenous, and is universally cultivated, but in a very rude manner; it is still more rudely manufactured, so as to be wholly unfit for exportation abroad. The most common fruits in Burma are the mango, the tamarind, the guava, the orange, the citron, the pine, the custard apple, the jack, the *papaya*, and the plantain. The yam and the sweet potato are grown, but not extensively; the common potato is largely cultivated by the Kakhyens on the Chinese frontier, where it is known by the name of 'foreigner's root.' Onions are produced; and capsicum, which, after salt, is the most ordinary condiment used by the Burmese, is cultivated everywhere.\n\n**Forests.**\u2014The forests of Burma abound in valuable trees. Among these teak holds a conspicuous place, though some of the finest teak forests were lost to the Burmese with Pegu. Almost every description of timber known in India grows in the forests, from which also an abundant supply is obtained of the varnish employed by the Shans and the Burmese in their manufacture of lacquered ware. Stick-lac of an\nexcellent quality is obtained in the woods, and rubber of late years has been largely exported.\n\nMinerals.\u2014Burma is rich in minerals. It produces gold, silver, copper, tin, lead, antimony, bismuth, amber, coal, petroleum, nitre, natron, salt, limestone, and marble, the jade or \\( yu \\) of the Chinese, sapphires, and other precious stones. Gold is found in the sands of different rivers, and also towards the Shan territory on the eastern frontier; but the demand is very much greater than the native supply. There are silver mines near the Chinese frontier, but they have not been worked recently. The mountainous districts of the Shan territory contain almost all the other metals; but they are scantily exported, and the copper and tin seen in the capital are imported from China. Iron is found in several places, and is wrought especially at Poppa, near a mountain of that name to the eastward of the old capital Pagan, and also at Myed\u00fa, north-west of Mandalay; but, owing to ignorance and the want of proper methods, about 30 or 40 per cent. of the metal is lost in the process. Large deposits of rich magnetic oxide, as yet untouched, exist in the ridges east of Mandalay near the banks of the navigable river Myit-ng\u00e9, and the same district contains lime in great abundance and of remarkable whiteness; while statuary marble, equal to the best Italian kinds, is found about 15 miles north of Mandalay, to the east of the Irawadi. Mines of amber are wrought, among other places, at H\u00fakhong or Payendwen, near the sources of the Kyeng-dweng. Nitre, natron, and salt are found in various quarters. Sulphur also occurs in some places, as in the district of Sale-Myo, and in the neighbourhood of the petroleum wells; but the quantity is comparatively small. Coal has been discovered in patches, but not in any quantity worth working. Petroleum is found near the village of Ye-nangyaung, on the banks of the Irawadi. Here are upwards of one hundred pits or wells, with a general depth of from 210 to 240 feet, though some of them reach to the depth of 300 feet. The liquid appears to boil up from the bottom like an abundant spring, and is extracted in buckets, and sent to all quarters of the country. The annual yield is calculated at 11,690 tons. A good deal is now exported to England.\n\nThe precious stones produced in the Burmese territories are chiefly the sapphire and the ruby. They are found about 60 or 70 miles in a north-east direction from Mandalay, over an area of about 100 square miles. All stones are sent to the Crown treasury. No stranger is ever permitted to approach the spots where these precious stones are found. The \\( yu \\) or jade mines are situated in the Mogoung district, about 23 miles south-west of Maing-kh\u00fam. Momien, in Yunan, was formerly the chief seat of the manufacture of jade, and still produces a considerable quantity of small articles.\nFera Nature.\u2014Burma, abounding as it does in deep, impenetrable jungles, affords extensive shelter to wild animals. Elephants and wild hogs are very numerous, and the single and double-horned rhinoceros are not uncommon. There are nearly 30 kinds of carnivora, including the tiger, leopard, bear, and wild cat. Quadrumania are found in 6 or 7 distinct species; and among ruminants, the barking deer, hog deer, Rusa (sambhar), goat-antelope, bison, buffalo, and wild ox. Rabbits are unknown, but hares are common. There are 2 species of porpoises, which are found very far inland. The rivers, lakes, and estuaries swarm with fish, including whiting, mullet, carp, barbel, bream, shad, and cat-fish. Aquatic birds abound in endless varieties. Among other birds, pea-fowl, jungle-fowl, pheasant, partridge, quail, and plover are found throughout the country. Geese, duck, and fowl are extensively domesticated, and cock-fighting is a favourite amusement with the people.\n\nDomestic Animals.\u2014The domestic animals are the elephant, buffalo, ox, horse, mule, ass, goat, sheep, and pig. The three first are used for draught, the elephant being especially useful in dragging timber. The horse is a small variety, rarely exceeding 13 hands in height. Like the mule and ass, it is used only as a beast of burden.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The Burmese proper may be generally described as of a short, stout, active, well-proportioned form; of a brown but never intensely dark complexion, with black, coarse, lank, and abundant hair on the head, and very rarely any on the face. The name they give their own race is Mran-m\u00e1 (as written), corrupted vulgarly into Ba-m\u00e1, and from this the various forms of 'Burma' appear to have been taken. Besides the Burmese proper, there are numerous tribes of Talaungs, Taunghas, Karens, and others who occupy the mountainous country towards the east, many of them in a state of semi-independence; and all round the northern and north-western frontier and along the ranges that traverse the upper regions, vast hordes of Kakhyens, Chins, and Singphos maintain a rough, cateran life, and come down to levy black-mail on the more peaceful inhabitants. The Shans, a race of which the Siamese are a part, constitute a great number of small principalities along the whole eastern border, subject some to Burma, some to China, some to Siam, and in a few cases owning a double allegiance, according to their position. The Shans everywhere profess Buddhism, and have some kind of literature and the traces of culture. The Kakhyens are square-faced, strong-jawed, and oblique-eyed. They are still in a low state of civilisation, are destitute of letters, and have not yet been converted to Buddhism. Their chiefs are supported by offerings in kind,\u2014receiving a leg of every animal that is killed. One industry\u2014the manufacture of toddy and arrack\u2014is extensively carried on by them, and the whole popula-\ntion are regular consumers of the produce. Various other tribes, as the Pwons and the Kakus, are scattered throughout the empire; but they are not of much individual importance.\n\nThe population of Upper Burma has been variously estimated. Mr. Craufurd, on untrustworthy data, rated the inhabitants at 22 to the square mile, which, under the now contracted limits of the empire, would give a population of 3,090,000. Colonel Yule calculated, in 1855, that, within the area between the British frontier and 24\u00b0 N. lat., it probably did not exceed 1,200,000; while within the whole empire at its widest limits there were not more than 3,000,000. Count Bethlen states, in 1874, that he obtained statistics of the houses in Burma from a Burmese official, which made the number 700,000, without including those among the Shans to the east of the Salwin. Allowing five inhabitants to each house, this would show 3,500,000 for the total population, and including the Shans probably 4,000,000.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The Burmese Government is a pure despotism, the king sentencing to torture, imprisonment, or death, according to his sovereign pleasure. The administration is conducted through ministers whose number, rank, and functions are strictly defined by constitutional precedent; the institutions and court ceremonies are exceedingly elaborate and complex, even to the minutest details. The following description has been condensed from a lecture delivered at Simla, by Mr. K. H. Pilcher, of the Bengal Civil Service, the officer who accompanied the Burmese Embassy in 1882. It gives a clear idea of the administration of the country as carried on at the present day. The Burmese ministers are of two classes whose duties and position were in old times quite distinct, though they are now more or less merged in each other. The one class consists of those whose authority and responsibility are confined to the palace; originally, no doubt, they were officers of the household. The other class consists of administrative officers, properly so called, who constitute a Great Council of State, called in Burmese the 'Hl\u00fat-daw' or 'Hl\u00fat,' in which all administrative power is vested. The Hl\u00fat or Council thus discharges at once the functions of a house of legislature, a cabinet, and a supreme court of justice. The President of the Hl\u00fat is nominally the king himself, or in his absence the heir-apparent, or some other member of the royal family. Practically the prime minister usually presides.\n\nThere are in all 14 grades of officers who compose the Council. Eleven of these grades comprise four officers each. They are as follows:\u2014First, the W\u00fangy\u00eds or Mingy\u00eds. The term 'W\u00fan,' by which many kinds of officials in Burma are designated, means literally a 'burden,' and metaphorically a 'burden of affairs' or the bearer of it. W\u00fangy\u00ed is hence a 'great official.' If the title had to be translated\ninto English, 'Secretary of State' would probably express it best. Each of these chief ministers has his own department or departments, but the distribution of work is a personal matter, and is never unalterably fixed. Their titles are not attached to their office or hereditary, but are given from time to time by the king. There is no such wide differentiation of functions, no such division of labour among the Burmese, whether officials or common people, as there is among European nations. The W\u00fangyi has not only to consider politics, revenue, and finance, but to decide important civil and criminal suits, to direct military operations, and on occasion to take the field in person as generalissimo. Next to the W\u00fangy\u00eds in rank, come two officers, who, though they have a customary right to seats in the Hl\u00fat, yet do not often take part, and have, in fact, little concern, in its business. These are the Myinz\u00fagy\u00ed W\u00fan, and the Athi\u00fac\u00fan. The former is the officer commanding the principal cavalry regiments, the latter is in charge of civilians, that is to say, persons other than those of the royal family.\n\nAfter these come the W\u00fandouks, who may be called 'Under Secretaries of State,' or assistants of the W\u00fangy\u00eds. Normally they are four in number, but there are often more, for the rank is occasionally conferred on Governors of important provinces as a reward for good service. As a rule, W\u00fandouks and all other high officials are known by the name of some town or District.\n\nNext in rank to W\u00fandouks come the Nakhandaws, or 'Royal Listeners.' Their function is that of carrying communications from the king to the Council and vice versa. They write these in large notebooks with gilt covers, which are the insignia of their office. They too are four in number.\n\nThe Sayaydawgy\u00eds, or 'Royal Clerks,' are the Assistant Secretaries, who come next in rank; of these officials there are about a score, though the number by custom should be four only, but as they have multifarious work, and are really very important officers, the number has been increased. Their position is somewhat analogous to that of the registrar of a court. They hold preliminary investigations in important judicial matters, and subject to the minister's approval decide unimportant cases themselves; in general business, it is they who do most of the actual executive work.\n\nNext to the Assistant Secretaries are the Ameindawyay, four in number, whose duty it is to record and transcribe royal orders of all kinds, or as we should say, orders of the Government.\n\nThe seventh grade is that of Athongsayay, officers who form a rudimentary Department of Public Works. They have to keep the public buildings in repair, and to build new ones when required.\n\nNext in rank are the Ahmadawyay, and after them the Awayyouk.\nThe former are drafters; they prepare for issue all letters and orders sent out from the Council. The latter receive and read letters received from a distance\u2014whence the title\u2014and submit them to the ministers. These two classes of officers and their assistants are, in fact, the correspondence clerks.\n\nThe two Thaudawgans, or 'Receivers of Royal letters,' are ceremonial officers. Three times a year the king holds a darb\u00e1r, called a Kadaw-bweh, which literally means, 'beg pardon festival.' At this all high officials and feudatory chiefs, who can, attend and do homage to the king.\n\nThe Sesongsay\u00e1ys, the next in rank, make lists of all gifts presented to the king and read them out at darb\u00e1rs.\n\nThe Yongzau is a sort of master of ceremonies, who makes arrangements for darb\u00e1rs, gives notice to the officers who are to attend, and informs them what business is to be done, and what dress they are to appear in.\n\nThe Nechas, or 'Ushers,' point out to each officer his place at ceremonial meetings of Council and levees.\n\nThe Thissadawyay, or 'Oath Recorders,' are employed to administer the oath of fealty to all who enter the king's service. The ceremony used is worth describing. The oath is first written down on paper, and read over in a temple before an image of Gautama, the candidate repeating the words; the paper is then burnt, and the ashes are put into a cup of water; the water is then stirred with a small faggot, on which miniature models of the five kinds of weapons used by the Burmese are all tied up together; and finally the person to be sworn in, drinks the cup of water. The five weapons referred to are the bow, the spear, the sword, the cannon, and the musket.\n\nThe above are the officers who compose the Hl\u00fat-daw or 'Great Council' of the kingdom.\n\nOf the other class whose authority and responsibility are confined to the palace, or officers of the Household, the Atwinw\u00fans form the first grade. Their office or place of assembly is styled the Bweh-dyke. The title of Atwinw\u00fan means 'Interior Minister,' whose duty it is to transact business generally relating to the interior of the palace, but especially to take up business from the Council to the king. The relative rank of the Atwinw\u00fans with members of the Council is not absolutely defined; as a rule, they are certainly above the W\u00fcndouks at the present day.\n\nNext in rank to the Atwinw\u00fans are the Thandawzins, who are supposed to be always in attendance at audiences to take down the king's orders, and to transmit them to the Hl\u00fat. They bear forth in state from the palace royal letters, and perform similar ceremonial offices. Next come the chief clerks and officers who have charge of the lighting of the palace, and who keep a record of all persons sleeping inside.\nBeside the Hl\u00fat and Bweh-dyke, the public and privy councils, there is the Shwa-dyke or 'Treasury,' which is not only the treasury, but also the depository of the archives of the State. The king's artificers are hereditary servants, and the heads of their families are accounted officers of the Shwa-dyke.\n\nThe country at large is ruled by Provincial Governors, and is divided into Provinces (or Myos), townships, Districts, and villages. The civil, military, judicial, and fiscal administration of the Province is vested in the Governor or Myo-win, who exercises the power of life and death, though in all civil cases an appeal lies from his sentence to the chief council of the capital. In all townships and villages, there are officers with a subordinate jurisdiction. The late king introduced the system of paying his officials monthly salaries, but it has been very partially carried out.\n\nOne of the principal items of revenue in Independent Burma is the capitation, or more properly, the income tax. The rate of this tax varies from 6 to 10 rupees (12 to 20 shillings) per annum on each household; it is fixed yearly, and collected in April or May, either by the District officers or by special collectors selected for their probity.\n\nThe priesthood form a separate order, interdicted from all secular employment, and supported by voluntary contributions. They are distinguished by a special costume, which it would be reckoned sacrilege in any other person to wear. There is also an order of nuns and priestesses, who make a vow of chastity, but who may at any time quit their order. Prostitutes are considered as outcasts. The women in Burma are not shut up as in many other parts of the East, and excluded from the sight of men; on the contrary, they are suffered to appear openly in society, and have free access in their own name to the courts of law, where, if ill-treatment is proved, divorce is readily obtained.\n\nRevenue.\u2014The taxes from which the public revenue arises, are in general rude and ill-contrived expedients for extortion, and are vexatious to the people, at the same time that they are little productive to the State. The most important is the house or family tax, which is said to be assessed by a 'Domesday Book,' compiled by order of Mentaragyi in 1783. The amount varies greatly in different years, and to a remarkable extent in different Districts. Next in order is the tax on agriculture, which is also very irregularly imposed. A large part of the cultivated land of the kingdom is assigned to favourites of the court, or to public functionaries in lieu of stipends or salaries, or is appropriated to the expenses of public establishments, such as war-boats, elephants, etc.; and this assignment conveys a right to tax the inhabitants according to the discretion of the assignee. The court favourites who receive these grants, generally appoint agents to manage\ntheir estates; they pay a certain tax or quit-rent to the crown, and their agents extort from the cultivators as much more as they can by every mode of oppression, often by torture. Besides this stated tax, extraordinary contributions are levied directly from the lords and nobles to whom the lands are assigned, who in their turn levy it from the cultivators, and generally make it a pretence for plunder and extortion.\n\n**Arts and Manufactures.** \u2014 The architecture of religious edifices erected in the Middle Ages is of striking and effective character, although the material is only of brick. The general style bears evidence of an Indian origin; but numerous local modifications have been introduced. Perhaps the feature of most interest is the use of the pointed arch, as well as the flat and the circular, and that at a time long anterior to its employment in India. Modern buildings are chiefly of wood; palaces and monasteries, carved with extraordinary richness of detail, and often gilt all over, present an aspect of barbaric splendour. The *daghobas* (*daghoba = dh\u0101tu garbha*, 'relic chamber'), which form at once the objects and the localities of Buddhist worship, are almost the only brick structures now erected, and these are often gilt all over. In carving, the Burmese artisans display unusual skill and inventiveness, and give full scope to the working of a luxuriant and whimsical fancy. The application of gilding is carried to an extravagant extent; as much as \u00a340,000 is said to have been expended on this account for a single temple. The finest architectural monuments are to be found in the deserted city of Pagan, but many of the most magnificent are greatly shattered by earthquakes.\n\nThe number of religious buildings, small and great, throughout the country is very great: at every turn the traveller finds pagodas or *kyaungs* (monasteries), or lesser shrines, or *zayats* (resting-places for travellers), founded by the Buddhists in order to acquire religious merit. The ordinary buildings are of a very slight construction; all but the more pretentious are built of bamboo, and roofed with grass. They are invariably on piles well raised from the ground. The whole process of the cotton manufacture is performed by women, who use a rude but efficient species of loom, and produce an excellent cloth, though they are much inferior in dexterity to the Indian artisans. Silk cloth is manufactured at different places from Chinese silk. The favourite patterns are zigzag longitudinal stripes of different colours, and the brilliance of the contrasts is frequently gorgeous in its results. The dyeing of the yellow robes of the priests is effected by means of the leaves of the jack-tree. The common, coarse, and unglazed earthenware is of an excellent quality; and a not inartistic glazed pottery is also made. The art of making porcelain, however, is entirely unknown. Iron-ore, as already men-\ntioned, is smelted; but the Burmese cannot manufacture steel, which is brought from Bengal.\n\nBell-founding has been carried to considerable perfection. The largest specimen is that at the Meng\u00fan Pagoda, near the present capital, which measures 16 feet across the lip and weighs about 80 tons. Coarse articles of cutlery, including swords, spears, knives, also muskets and matchlocks, scissors, and carpenters' tools, are manufactured in the capital; and gold and silver ornaments are produced at every considerable place throughout the country. Embossed work in drinking-cups and the like is executed with great richness of effect. North of the capital, and east of the Irawadi, as before stated, is an entire hill of pure white marble, and there are sculptured marble images of Gautama or Buddha. The marble is of the finest quality, and the workmen give it an exquisite polish by means of a paste of pulverized fossil-wood. The chief seat of the manufacture of lacquered ware is at Nyaungu, near the ancient city of Pagan; the ware consists of thin strips of bamboo, woven in the manner of basket ware, and coated with lacquer, elaborately and artistically ornamented in coloured patterns. The general use of lacquered ware is, however, giving way before the employment of imported earthenware.\n\nCommerce.\u2014Since Burma was deprived of its harbours and maritime Districts, its foreign commerce has been extremely limited. The trade of the country centres chiefly in the capital, and is entirely in the hands of Chinese, Muhammadan, and Burmese merchants; it is carried on chiefly by way of the Irawadi. The principal imports are\u2014European twist and piece-goods, earthenware and porcelain, fruits and nuts, rice, brass, copper, iron, and other metals, oils, \\(n\\text{ga}-\\text{pi}\\) and other provisions, salt, raw silk and silk goods, spices, refined sugar, and woollen goods. In exchange are given, ponies and cattle, lacquered ware, raw cotton and cotton piece-goods, wheat and gram, cutch, hides, petroleum, other oils, provisions, \\(jinjili\\) (sesamum), seed, silk goods, raw sugar, pickled tea, and timber.\n\nThe total value of trade with British Burma, for the three years ending 1881, is given in the following table:\n\n|                | 1878-79   | 1879-80   | 1880-81   |\n|----------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Imports        | \u00a31,775,491| \u00a31,751,388| \u00a31,712,302|\n| Exports        | 2,000,880 | 1,807,809 | 1,613,971 |\n| Total          | \u00a33,776,371| \u00a33,559,197| \u00a33,326,273|\n\nThe decline of trade with British Burma is chiefly due to the unsettled state of the country since the death of the late king. The\narbitrary and oppressive treatment of traders by the present ruler, which has resulted in reducing commercial intercourse between Independent and British Burma, necessitated representations on the part of the British Government, which will, it is hoped, have the effect of restoring the trade to its normal state. The inland trade with China, which the Panthay rebellion had interrupted for years, has recently sprung into renewed activity; cotton and jade are exchanged for copper, lead, iron, and fruit in yearly increasing quantities. The trade of the northern part of Burma is chiefly carried on at large fairs held in connection with religious festivals. The trade of the country would expand indefinitely if the monopolies for certain articles of export, as cotton, sugar, cutch, and pickled tea, granted in 1881 by the present ruler, were withdrawn, and if only a safe road existed between Bhamo on the Irawadi and the confines of Western China.\n\nDuring the year 1880, two English missionaries travelled from Bhamo across the hills into Yunnan, and through Western China to the Yellow river, on which they voyaged by boat and steamer to Shanghai. One of the travellers had been several years in China and knew Chinese well. They were unarmed, and had only two attendants. They were molested once only, and that was at a place two days' journey out of Bhamo, half-way from the Irawadi river to the Chinese frontier. Directly they reached China, they met with uniform friendliness and hospitality. They found the convention of Chefu thoroughly known and observed, and the people wondering why no British merchants had come to settle at Talifu and other towns on the trade-route. The travellers reached Talifu in 21 days, the capital of Yunnan in 46 days, and the Yangtsi river in Southern Szechuen in 68 days. At this point they were 1756 miles from Shanghai; and they did the rest of their journey by the Yellow river, excepting the 100 miles of rapids and rocks, between Quichow and Ichang. The flotilla steamers reach Bhamo from Rangoon in 15 or 20 days; and it seems certain that for the millions of Chinese in Yunnan and Southern Szechuen, the Irawadi and Bhamo route would be a far nearer, quicker, and cheaper route for trade with Europe, if only the road from Bhamo to the Yunnan border were safe. One of the most important articles of trade, in addition to European cloth goods, is salt, for their supply of which all the hill tribes are dependent on Burma.\n\nMoney.\u2014A gold and silver currency was introduced by the late king. It corresponds to our Indian coinage.\n\nWeights.\u2014The Burmese dry measure is the teng, or basket, which is divided into 4 quarters and 16 pyis. In long measure the cubit measures about 18 English inches. Four cubits make a fathom: 7 cubits make a ta, and 1000 tas a mile, corresponding nearly with 2\nEnglish miles. In weights, 100 kyats (or tickals) make a viss, which equals 3\u00b765 lbs. avoirdupois. Four mats make 1 kyat, and 2 milgyis a mat.\n\nCalendar.\u2014The current Burmese era commences from April A.D. 639. The year consists of twelve lunar months of twenty-nine and thirty days, one being intercalated every third year. A month is divided into two parts, the waxing and the wane; also into weeks, which follow the usual order of days. The day and night are each divided into four periods or beats of three hours each, commencing from nine o'clock.\n\nLanguage and Literature.\u2014The Burmese proper use a monosyllabic language, which shows distinct relation to Chinese on one side, and to Tibetan on another. In contrast with Siamese, it is a very soft and flexible tongue, and its monosyllabic character is somewhat modified in pronunciation. It is a literary language, and has been under cultivation for perhaps six or seven centuries. It is written with an alphabet of Indian origin, and the letters are of a more or less circular form. A square variety was formerly prevalent. It has developed a poetic diction of such complete individuality, that it is unintelligible without special study. The national chronicles, or chronicles of the kings (Mah\u00e1-r\u00e1za Weng), trace the royal lineage up to the very earliest ages. Though much of their history is no doubt of a questionable kind, the mutual agreement of the chronologies of the medi\u00e6val annals of the various Indo-Chinese kingdoms is remarkable, and affords a strong contrast to the absence of all written Hindu chronology in India proper at the same period. Libraries are common throughout the country, principally in the monasteries. Though a certain kind of paper is manufactured from bamboo pulp, the usual material of the books is the palm leaf, while for ordinary notebook purposes a kind of black tablet, called a parabaik, and a steatite pencil are employed.\n\nHistory.\u2014It is probable that Burma is the Chryse Regio of Ptolemy, a name parallel in meaning to Sonaparanta, the classic P\u00e1li title assigned to the country round the capital in Burmese documents. The royal history traces the lineage of the kings to the ancient Buddhist monarchs of India. This is hypothetical, but it is hard to say how early communication with Gangetic India began. From the 11th to the 13th century the old Burmese empire was at the height of its power, and to this period belong the splendid remains of architecture at Pagan. The city and the dynasty were destroyed by a Chinese (or rather Mongol) invasion (1284 A.D.), in the reign of Kubl\u00e1\u00ed Kh\u00e1n. Afterwards the empire fell to a low ebb, and Central Burma was often subject to Shan dynasties. In the early part of the 16th century, the Burmese princes of Toung-gu, in the north-east of\nPegu began to rise to power, and established a dynasty which at one time held possession of Pegu, Ava, and Arakan. They made their capital at Pegu, and to this dynasty belong the gorgeous descriptions of some of the travellers of the 16th century. Their wars exhausted the country, and before the end of the century ensued a period of decay.\n\nA new dynasty arose in Ava, which subdued Pegu, and maintained supremacy during the 17th, and during the first forty years of the 18th century. The Peguans or Talaings then revolted, and having taken the capital Ava, and made the king prisoner, reduced the whole country to submission. Alompra (the Alaung-paya of the previous article), ruler of the village of Motso-bo, planned the deliverance of his country. He attacked the Peguans with small detachments; but when his forces increased, he suddenly advanced, and took possession of the capital in the autumn of 1753. In 1754, the Peguans sent an armament of war-boats against Ava, but they were totally defeated by Alompra; while in the Districts of Prome, Donaby\u00fa, etc., the Burmese revolted, and expelled all the Pegu garrisons from their towns. In the same year, Prome was besieged by the King of Pegu, who was again defeated by Alompra; and the war was transferred from the upper provinces to the mouths of the navigable rivers, and the numerous creeks and canals which intersect the low country. In 1755, the King of Pegu\u2019s brother was equally unsuccessful; after which the Peguans were driven from Bassein and the adjacent country, and were forced to withdraw to the fortress of Syriam, distant 12 miles from Rangoon. Here they enjoyed a brief repose, Alompra being called away to quell an insurrection of his own subjects, and to repel an invasion of the Siamese; but returning victorious, he laid siege to the fortress of Syriam, and took it by surprise. In these wars the French sided with the Peguans, the English with the Burmese. Dupleix, the Governor of Pondicherri, had sent two ships to the aid of the former; but the master of the first was decoyed up the river by Alompra, where he was massacred along with his whole crew. The other vessel escaped to Pondicherri. Alompra was now master of all the navigable rivers; and the Peguans, shut out from foreign aid, were finally subdued. In 1757, the conqueror laid siege to the city of Pegu, which capitulated, on condition that their own king should govern the country, but that he should do homage for his kingdom, and should also surrender his daughter to the victorious monarch.\n\nAlompra never contemplated the fulfilment of the conditions; and having obtained possession of the town, abandoned it to the fury of his soldiers. In the following year the Peguans vainly endeavoured to throw off the yoke. Alompra afterwards reduced the town and District of Tavoy, and finally undertook the conquest of\nthe Siamese. His army advanced to Mergui and Tenasserim, both which towns were taken; and he was besieging the capital of Siam when he was taken ill. He immediately ordered his army to retreat, in hopes of reaching his capital alive; but he expired on the way, in 1760, in the fiftieth year of his age, after he had reigned eight years. In the previous year, he had massacred the English of the establishment of Negrais, whom he suspected of assisting the Peguans. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Naung-daw-gyi, whose reign was disturbed by the rebellion of his brother Hsin-phy\u00fa-yin, and afterwards by one of his father's generals. He died in little more than three years, leaving one son in his infancy; and on his decease the throne was seized by his brother Hsin-phy\u00fa-yin. The new king was intent, like his predecessors, on the conquest of the adjacent States, and accordingly made war in 1765 on the Manipur kingdom, and also on the Siamese, with partial success. In the following year he defeated the Siamese, and, after a long blockade, obtained possession of their capital. But while the Burmese were extending their conquests in this quarter, they were invaded by a Chinese army of 50,000 men from the Province of Yunan. This army was hemmed in by the skill of the Burmese; and, being reduced by want of provisions, it was afterwards attacked and totally destroyed, with the exception of 2500 men, who were sent in fetters to work in the Burmese capital at their several trades. In the meantime the Siamese revolted; and while the Burmese army was marching against them, the Peguan soldiers who had been incorporated in it rose against their companions, and, commencing an indiscriminate massacre, pursued the Burmese army to the gates of Rangoon, which they besieged, but were unable to capture. In 1774, Hsin-phy\u00fa-yin was engaged in reducing the marauding tribes. He took the District and fort of Martaban from the revolted Peguans; and in the following year he sailed down the Irawadi with an army of 50,000 men, and, arriving at Rangoon, put to death the aged monarch of Pegu, along with many of his nobles, who had shared with him in the offence of rebellion. He died in 1776, after a reign of twelve years, during which he had extended the Burmese dominions on every side.\n\nHe was succeeded by his son, a youth of eighteen, called Tsing\u00fa-ming ('Changuzo' of Symes), who proved himself a bloodthirsty despot, and was put to death in 1781 by his uncle, Bhodauphra or Mentaragyi, who ascended the vacant throne. In 1783 the new king effected the conquest of Arakan. In the same year he removed his residence from Ava, which, with brief interruptions, had been the capital for four centuries, to the new city of Amarapura, 'the City of the Immortals.' The Siamese who had revolted in 1771 were never afterwards subdued by the Burmese; but the latter retained their dominion over the sea-coast as far as Mergui. In the year 1785, they attacked the island of\nJunkseylon with a fleet of boats and an army, but were ultimately driven back with loss; and a second attempt by the Burmese monarch, who in 1786 invaded Siam with an army of 30,000 men, was attended with no better success. In 1793, peace was concluded between these two powers, the Siamese yielding to the Burmese the entire possession of the coast of Tenasserim on the Indian Ocean, and the two important seaports of Mergui and Tavoy.\n\nIn 1795, the Burmese were involved in a dispute with the British in India, in consequence of their troops, to the number of 5000 men, having entered the District of Chittagong, in pursuit of three robbers who had fled from justice across the frontier. Explanations being made and terms of accommodation offered by General Erskine, the commanding officer, the Burmese commander retired from British territory, when the fugitives were restored, and all differences for the time amicably arranged.\n\nBut it was evident that the gradual extension of the British and Burmese territories would in time bring the two powers into close contact along a more extended line of frontier, and in all probability lead to a war between them. It happened, accordingly, that the Burmese, carrying their arms into Assam and Manipur, penetrated to the British border near Sylhet, on the north-east frontier of Bengal, beyond which were the possessions of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Cach\u00e1r, under the protection of the British Government. The Burmese leaders, arrested in their career of conquest, were impatient to measure their strength with their new neighbours, and at length ventured on the open violation of British territory. They attacked a party of Sepoys within the frontier, and seized and carried off British subjects, while at all points their troops, moving in large bodies, assumed the most menacing positions. In the south, encroachments were made upon the British frontier of Chittagong. The island of Sh\u00e1hpuri, at the mouth of the N\u00e1f river, had been occupied by a small guard of British troops. These were attacked on the 23rd September 1823 by the Burmese, and driven from their post with the loss of several lives; and to the repeated demands of the British for redress, no answer was returned. Other outrages ensued; and at length, in February 1824, war was declared by the British Government.\n\nHostilities having commenced, the British rulers in India resolved to carry the war into the enemy's country; an armament, under Commodore Grant and Sir Archibald Campbell, entered the Irawadi river, and anchored off Rangoon on the 10th May 1824. After a feeble resistance this great seaport surrendered, and the troops were landed. The place was entirely deserted by its inhabitants, the provisions were carried off or destroyed, and the invading force took possession of a complete solitude. On the 28th May, Sir A. Campbell ordered an\nattack on some of the nearest posts, which were all carried after a feeble defence. Another attack was made on the 10th June, on the stockades at the village of Kemmendine. Some of these were battered by artillery; and the shot and shell struck such terror into the Burmese that they fled in the utmost precipitation. It soon, however, became apparent that the expedition had been undertaken with very imperfect knowledge of the country, and without adequate provision. The devastation of the country, which was part of the defensive system of the Burmese, was carried out with unrelenting rigour, and the invaders were soon reduced to great difficulties. The health of the men declined, and their ranks were fearfully thinned. The monarch of Ava sent large reinforcements to his dispirited and beaten army; and early in July, an attack was commenced on the British line, but proved unsuccessful. On the 8th, the British assaulted. The enemy were beaten at all points; and their strongest stockaded works, battered to pieces by a powerful artillery, were in general abandoned. With the exception of an attack by the Prince of Tharrawadi in the end of August, the enemy allowed the British to remain unmolested during the months of July and August.\n\nThis interval was employed by Sir A. Campbell in subduing the Burmese Provinces of Tavoy and Mergui, and the whole coast of Tenasserim. This was an important conquest, as the country was salubrious and afforded convalescent stations for the sick, who were now so numerous in the British army that there were scarcely 3000 soldiers fit for duty. An expedition was about this time sent against the old Portuguese fort and factory of Syriam, at the mouth of the Pegu river, which was taken; and in October the Province of Martaban was brought under the authority of the British.\n\nThe court of Ava, alarmed by the discomfiture of its armies, recalled the veteran legions which were employed in Arakan, under their renowned leader M\u00e1ha Band\u00fala, in vain attempts to penetrate the British frontier. Band\u00fala hastened by forced marches to the defence of his country; and by the end of November an army of 60,000 men had surrounded the British position at Rangoon and Kemmendine, for the defence of which Sir Archibald Campbell had only 5000 efficient troops. The enemy in great force made repeated attacks on Kemmendine without success, and, on the 7th December, Band\u00fala was completely routed by Sir A. Campbell. The fugitives retired to a strong position on the river, which they again entrenched; and here they were attacked by the British on the 15th, and driven in complete confusion from the field.\n\nSir Archibald Campbell now resolved to advance on Prome, about 100 miles higher up the Irawadi river. He moved with his force on the 13th February 1825 in two divisions, one proceeding by land, and the\nother, under General Cotton, destined for the reduction of Donaby\u00fa, being embarked on the flotilla. Taking the command of the land force, he continued his advance till the 11th March, when intelligence reached him of the failure of the attack upon Donaby\u00fa. He instantly commenced a retrograde march; on the 27th he effected a junction with General Cotton's force, and on the 2nd April carried the entrenchments at Donaby\u00fa with little resistance, Bandula having been killed by the explosion of a bomb. The English general entered Prome on the 25th, and remained there during the rainy season. On the 17th September an armistice was concluded for one month. In the course of the summer, General Morrison had conquered the Province of Arakan; in the north the Burmese were expelled from Assam; and the British had made some progress in Cachar, though their advance was finally impeded by thick forests and jungle.\n\nThe armistice having expired on the 17th October, the army of Ava, amounting to 60,000 men, advanced in three divisions against the British position at Prome, which was defended by 3000 Europeans and 2000 Native troops. But the British still triumphed; and after several actions, in which the Burmese were the assailants and were partially successful, Sir A. Campbell, on the 1st December, attacked the different divisions of their army, and successfully drove them from all their positions, and dispersed them in every direction. The Burmese retired on Myede and afterwards on Mellon, along the course of the Irawadi, where they occupied, with 10,000 or 12,000 men, a series of strongly-fortified heights and a formidable stockade. On the 26th they sent a flag of truce to the British camp; and a negotiation having commenced, peace was offered on the following conditions:\n\n1st, The cession of Arakan, with the Provinces of Mergui, Tavoy, and Yea; 2nd, The renunciation by the Burmese sovereign of all claims upon Assam and the contiguous petty States; 3rd, The Company to be paid a crore of rupees as an indemnification for the expenses of the war; 4th, Residents from each Court to be allowed, with an escort of fifty men; while it was also stipulated that British ships should no longer be obliged to unship their rudders and land their guns as formerly in Burmese ports. This treaty was agreed to and signed, but the ratification of the king was still wanting; and it was soon apparent that the Burmese had no intention to sign it, but were preparing to renew the contest. On the 19th January, accordingly, Sir A. Campbell attacked and carried the enemy's position at Mellon. Another offer of peace was here made by the Burmese, but it was found to be insincere; and the fugitive army made at the ancient city of Pagan-myo a final stand in defence of the capital. They were attacked and overthrown on the 9th February 1826; and the invading force being now within four days' march of Ava, Dr. Price, an American missionary, who with other\nEuropeans had been thrown into prison when the war commenced, was sent to the British camp with the treaty ratified, the prisoners of war released, and an instalment of 25 lakhs of rupees. The war was thus brought to a successful termination, and the British army evacuated the country. The treaty is known in history as the Treaty of Yandab\u00fa.\n\nFor some years peaceful relations continued undisturbed. While the prince by whom the treaty was concluded continued in power, its main stipulations were fairly carried out. That monarch, Phagy-i-dau or Naungdaugyi, however, was obliged in 1837 to yield the throne to a usurper who appeared in the person of his brother, Kounboungmen or Tharrawadi. The latter, at an early period, manifested not only that hatred of the British connection which was almost universal at the Burmese Court, but also the extremest contempt. For several years it had become apparent that the period was approaching when war between the British and the Burmese Governments would a second time become inevitable. The British Resident, Major Burney, who had been appointed in 1830, finding his presence at Ava agreeable neither to the king nor to himself, removed in 1837 to Rangoon, and shortly afterwards retired from the country. Ultimately it became necessary to forego even the pretence of maintaining relations of friendship; and the British functionary in 1840, Captain Macleod, was withdrawn altogether from a country where his continuance would have been but a mockery.\n\nThe state of sullen dislike which followed was after a while succeeded by more active evidences of hostility. Acts of violence were committed on British ships and British seamen. Remonstrance was consequently made by the British Government, and its envoys were supported by a small naval force. The officers on whom devolved the duty of representing the wrongs of their fellow-countrymen and demanding redress, proceeded to Rangoon, the governor of which place had been a chief actor in the outrages complained of; but so far were they from meeting with any signs of regret, that they were themselves treated with indignity and contempt, and compelled to retire without accomplishing anything beyond blockading the ports. A series of negotiations followed; nothing was demanded of the Burmese beyond a very moderate compensation for the injuries inflicted on the masters of two British vessels, an apology for the insults offered by the Governor of Rangoon to the representatives of the British Government, and the re-establishment of at least the appearance of friendly relations by the reception of a British Agent by the Burmese Government. But the obduracy of the king\u2014known as Pagan-meng, who had succeeded his father in 1846\u2014led to the refusal alike of atonement for past wrongs, of any expression of regret for the display of gratuitous insolence, and of any indication of a desire to maintain friendship for the future. Another Burmese war was the result, the first shot being fired in January 1852. As in the\nformer, though success was varying, the British finally triumphed, and the chief towns in the lower part of the Burmese kingdom fell to them in succession. The city of Pegu, the capital of that portion which, after having been conquered, had again passed into the hands of the enemy, was recaptured and retained; and the whole Province of Pegu was, by proclamation of the Governor-General, Lord Dalhousie, declared to be annexed to the British Dominions on the 20th December 1852. No treaty was obtained or insisted upon, the British Government being content with the tacit acquiescence of the King of Burma without such documents; but the resolution was declared, that any active demonstration of hostility by him would be followed by retribution.\n\nAbout the same time a domestic revolution broke out which resulted in Pagan-meng's dethronement. His tyrannical and barbarous conduct had made him obnoxious at home as well as abroad, and indeed many of his actions recall the worst passages of the history of the later Roman emperors. His brother, the Prince of Mengd\u00fcn, who had become apprehensive for his own safety, made him prisoner in February 1853, and was himself crowned King of Burma towards the end of the year. The late monarch, known as Mengdun-meng, showed himself sufficiently arrogant in his dealings with European powers; but he was wise enough to desire to live on peaceful terms with the Indian Government. The loss of Pegu was long a matter of bitter regret, and he absolutely refused to acknowledge it by a formal treaty. In the beginning of 1855 he sent a mission of compliment to Lord Dalhousie, the Governor-General; and in the summer of the same year, Major Arthur Phayre, de facto governor of the new Province of Pegu, was appointed envoy to the Burmese court. He was accompanied by Captain (now Colonel) Henry Yule as secretary, and Mr. Oldham as geologist, and his mission added largely to our knowledge of the state of the country; but in its main object, of obtaining a treaty, it was unsuccessful. It was not until 1862 that the king at length yielded, so far as to conclude a treaty at least of commerce. A British Resident was, until October 1879, maintained at the capital. Much interest has been taken of recent years in the restoration of the trade between China and British Burma by the old routes overland, and various important journeys in elucidation of the problem have been successfully undertaken.\n\nIn 1867, a Treaty was signed by which British steamers were permitted to navigate Burmese waters, and the appointment of British agents at Bhamo and other stations for the supervision of trade, was formally authorized. In the following year a Government expedition, consisting of Captain Williams as surveyor, Dr. John Anderson as naturalist, and Captain Bowers and Messrs. Stewart and Burn as representatives of the commercial interests of Rangoon, was despatched under the leadership of Major Sladen, Political Agent at Mandalay. The\nroyal steamer *Yen\u00e1n-Saky\u00e1* was placed by the King at the service of the expedition, and letters of recommendation were furnished to the Burmese officials, but in other respects scant courtesy was shown to the party. Escorted by fifty armed police, the explorers advanced in safety about 135 miles north-east of Bhamo to Momein or Teng-yue-Chow, a principal town of the Muhammadan insurgents, known to the Burmese as Panthays, then in possession of Western Yunan; but beyond this it was not allowed by the Muhammadan authorities to proceed, on account of the disturbed condition of the country. In 1869, Captain Strover was appointed first British Resident at Bhamo; and about the same time, the Irawadi Flotilla Company started a monthly steamer service to that town. The King's interest in the commercial development of his country was shown by his erecting and garrisoning a series of guard-houses through the dangerous parts of the Kakhyen Hills.\n\nIn 1874, another expedition was despatched, consisting of Colonel Horace Browne, Mr. Ney Elias, and Dr. Anderson, with instructions to proceed, if possible, right across the country to Shanghai in China. To facilitate the success of the undertaking, Mr. Margary, a gentleman familiar with the Chinese language and customs, was commissioned to start from Shanghai and meet the party at Momein or the neighbourhood. The King's reception of the new mission, which arrived on December 23, 1874, at Mandalay, was favourable in the extreme. On the 15th January 1875, the explorers reached Bhamo; and two days afterwards Mr. Margary arrived from Hankow. After the mission had proceeded to the banks of the Nampaung, a river which joins the Tapeng some distance east of Ponline, they heard rumours of hostile preparations in front; and Mr. Margary volunteered to proceed to Manwaing to ascertain the truth of the reports. On receiving from him word that the way was clear, his companions advanced; but on the 23rd of February their camp was attacked by the Chinese, and they were ultimately compelled to retreat, with the sad knowledge that their gallant pioneer had fallen at Manwaing by the hands of cowardly assassins. The Burmese officials stood nobly by the mission, though the enemy assured them that their quarrel was not with them but with the 'white devils.'\n\nThe King, who was known before his accession in 1853 as the Prince of Mend\u00fan, died on 1st October 1878, and was succeeded, without any opposition, by one of his sons, called the Theebaw or Thiobo Prince, who massacred almost all the direct descendants of his predecessor in the month of February 1879. Remonstrances were made by the British Resident at Mandalay against this barbarity, but without much effect, and the feeling of insecurity which it inspired continued till the close of that year. The late king was on the whole, with all his faults, the best\nexample of a Burmese sovereign with whom we have ever had to do. He was personally an orthodox and a devoted Buddhist, and largely under the influence of ecclesiastical advisers. Indeed, in 1874 he was re-crowned at Mandalay, in compliance with the requirements of a prophecy; and he made spasmodic attempts to enforce sumptuary laws in accordance with his creed. In his anxiety to raise a revenue, his monopolies and other interferences with trade were injurious to the prosperity of the country.\n\nAlthough a suspicion in regard to British policy always lingered in the late king's mind, and led him into great expense to little purpose in endeavouring to cultivate a connection with other foreign powers, he generally acted in a friendly manner to the English who resided at his capital; and his reign was never stained with the abominable cruelties that were habitual under his predecessors. He seemed to have a really humane character; and while some of his officials were hostile to European interests, the great mass of the people appear genuinely favourable. As much cannot be said of the present King. The British Resident at Mandalay at the time of Theebaw's accession and of his palace massacres, was Mr. R. B. Shaw, C.I.E. After his death at Mandalay, which occurred in June 1879, Colonel Browne, Commissioner of Pegu, was temporarily deputed to Mandalay as Resident. He was succeeded by Mr. St. Barbe, who was withdrawn with the rest of the Residency officers in October 1879, and the British Government has since been unrepresented at the Court of Ava. At the end of October 1879, an Embassy from the King of Ava arrived at Thayet-myo, where it remained till June 1880; but as it had no authority to make concessions on points which were regarded as important by the British Government, no satisfactory results were attained. In spite of various disquieting rumours, no breach of peaceful relations between the British and Burmese Governments has yet occurred; and although no British Resident is stationed at Mandalay, direct communication has been maintained with the Ava Court. In June 1880, the Nyoung Oke prince, one of the refugee princes who quitted Mandalay shortly after the death of the late king, made an attempt at insurrection, but his operations were feeble and merely caused some temporary disturbance on the frontier. The prince made his escape into British territory, where he was detained and removed to Calcutta. An embassy from the King of Burma arrived at Simla in 1882 with a view, nominally, to a commercial treaty. It was productive of little or no results.\n\n**Butan.**\u2014See **Bhutan**.\n\n**But\u00e1n\u00e1.**\u2014Town in Goh\u00e1n\u00e1 tahsil, Rohtak District, Punjab, situated on a branch of the Western Jumna Canal, to which it gives its name.

The Census of 1881 returned a total population of 313,858. This number includes 24,433 hill people, who dwell in the mountainous Sub-division of Gunjong or North Cachar, formerly known as the Asalu Sub-division. The administrative headquarters are at the town of **Silchar**.\n\nThe District is bounded on the north by the Kopili and Diyang rivers, which separate it from Nowgong District; on the east by Manipur State and the N\u00e1g\u00e1 Hills District; on the south by the hill country occupied by the Lush\u00e1i or Kuk\u00ed tribe; on the west by the District of Sylhet and the Jaintia Hills. An Inner Line, in accordance with the regulations of the Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulation, No. V. of 1873, was demarcated in 1875 along the southern frontier, across which British subjects are not allowed to pass without special permission.\n\n**History.**\u2014The name of Cachar preserves the memory of one of the many kingdoms of indigenous origin which have at various times ruled over the greater part of Assam. When the last of the Cachari R\u00e1j\u00e1s died without heirs by assassination in 1830, the British took possession of the country. But the area then annexed to British India represented but a small portion of the territory once owned by the Cachar dynasty. The Cachari race is supposed to have first established itself, in the country that now goes by its name, in the beginning of the 18th century, having been gradually forced southwards from its original home. But their own traditions, combined with the ethnical affinities of the aboriginal tribes now inhabiting the valley of the Brahmaputra, show that the Cacharis must once have been a numerous and powerful people, dominant over nearly the whole of Assam. No trustworthy records exist concerning this period of Cachari supremacy. It is said to have preceded that of the Kochs (the Kochs and the Cacharis are, however, an identical race, the former being the name assumed by the latter on embracing Hinduism), and the kingdom seems to have\nincluded some portion of Eastern Bengal. As a historical fact, the Cachari R\u00e1j\u00e1s are first found ruling in the hill country, now occupied by N\u00e1g\u00e1 tribes, to the north of the B\u00e1reli watershed. Their capital was at Dimapur, at the foot of the hills, where extensive ruins of brick buildings and tanks have been discovered amid the dense jungle. The hilly tract of North Cachar is still peopled chiefly by Cacharis, although Kuk\u00eds and N\u00e1g\u00e1s share the country with them. It is not proved that the Cachari R\u00e1j\u00e1s had any dominion in the Ang\u00e1mi N\u00e1g\u00e1 country adjoining Dimapur, although they probably ruled the hills to the north, now occupied by Rengma N\u00e1g\u00e1s. Subsequently they were compelled to remove southward to M\u00e1ibong, in a valley between two spurs of the B\u00e1rel range, also on the north side of the watershed. Fruit-trees growing amid the jungle, and ruined temples of stone, prove that this settlement was of no short duration. It was at M\u00e1ibong that the Cachari court first came under the influence of Hinduism. The king is said to have married a daughter of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Tipperah, with whom he received as dowry the upper valley of the Bar\u00e1k. There is reason for believing that the Tipperah R\u00e1j\u00e1s are themselves of Cachari descent. Their dynastic title of Barman is the same as that of the Cachari R\u00e1j\u00e1s.\n\nHindus from Bengal naturally followed up the river from Sylhet, and missionary Br\u00e1hmans found their way to M\u00e1ibong as the pioneers of civilisation. The Cacharis of this period appear as a declining and fugitive race. Their capital at M\u00e1ibong was exposed to the aggressions of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Jaintia; and in the beginning of the 18th century they crossed the B\u00e1rel range and settled at K\u00e1shpur among its southern spurs. Nor was this the last move. When the British first became acquainted with Cachar, the residence of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 was at Garheritar, in Bikr\u00e1mpur parg\u00e1nd, now the site of a tea-garden. When the Cacharis had thus transferred themselves to the Bar\u00e1k valley, the process of conversion to Hinduism went on apace. Up to that date they had retained their native forms of worship, consisting mainly of the superstitious dread of a multitude of evil spirits, who demanded to be propitiated with the occasional sacrifice of a human being. The formal act of conversion took place as recently as 1790. The reigning R\u00e1j\u00e1, together with his brother and heir, were placed inside the body of a large copper cow, and thence produced by their Br\u00e1hman priests as Kshattriyas of the R\u00e1jbansi caste. The Barmans or members of the Cachari aristocracy adopted Hinduism at the same time; but the common people, at least those who occupy the original haunts of the race and are known as D\u00e1os or Parbattias, still retain their primitive religion, and repudiate the ceremonial restrictions of Hinduism. The further history of Cachar is a continuous record of strife and decay. The last R\u00e1j\u00e1, Gobind Chandra, became involved in the struggle\nbetween the State of Manipur and the aggressive power of Burma, which had already established its supremacy in the Brahmaputra valley. The Burmese won the day, and Gobind Chandra was driven to take refuge in the British District of Sylhet.\n\nIn 1826, as an incident in the first Burmese war, he was restored to his throne by a British force. But his English allies did not remain long enough in the country to re-establish his authority. One of his subjects, Tular\u00e1m Sen\u00e1pati, the general of the Cachari army, revolted and succeeded in establishing his independence in North Cachar. Finally, in 1830, Gobind Chandra was assassinated; and as he left no sons, the British took possession of Cachar in accordance with a clause in the treaty of 1826. The Sub-division of North Cachar was annexed in 1854, on the death of Tular\u00e1m Sen\u00e1pati, also without heirs.\n\nThe most important events in the recent history of Cachar are\u2014the discovery of the tea-plant growing wild, in 1855; the dispersion in 1857 of a body of mutinous Sepoys, who had made their way into the District from Chittagong (see CHITTAGONG DISTRICT); and the Lush\u00e1i expedition of 1871\u201372, by which the repeated inroads of the hill tribes on the southern frontier were checked. In January 1880, however, the Ang\u00e1mi N\u00e1g\u00e1s from Konoma in the N\u00e1g\u00e1 Hills made a descent upon a tea-garden in the north of the District, and killed the European planter with 22 of his servants. This led to a military expedition against the N\u00e1g\u00e1s in 1880\u201381, and the further annexation of their formerly independent tracts. The actual assailants on the tea-garden in Cachar were never captured, but relics of the raid were found in Konoma when the village surrendered, in March 1880. Towards the end of 1881, a Cachari fanatic gave out that he was possessed of supernatural powers, and that he had been ordained to restore the ancient Cachari kingdom. He gathered about him an ignorant following, who, after demanding the retrocession of North Cachar, attacked Gunjong, the sub-divisional head-quarters station, which they burnt to the ground, killing three persons. They next attacked the Deputy-Commissioner and sub-divisional officer, who were encamped at M\u00e1ibong, the ancient Cachari capital. Nine of the assailants were shot down, but the remainder succeeded in making their escape into the jungle. The Deputy-Commissioner received a sword-wound in the hand during the fray, which, for want of proper treatment, brought on mortification, eventually causing his death.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The District of Cachar occupies the upper portion of the valley of the Bar\u00e1k. It is surrounded on three sides by lofty ranges of hills, being only open on the west towards Sylhet. These mountain barriers rise steeply from the narrow plain, overgrown with dense green jungle, and broken by a few hill torrents and white cascades. Besides this background of noble scenery, the valley itself presents a\npicturesque appearance. In the centre, from east to west, runs a wide-rolling stream, navigable by steamers in the rains, and dotted with many native craft. On both sides, from north and south, low spurs and undulating ridges run down almost to the water's edge, with fertile valleys between. These lower hills, and the many isolated knolls which rise up all over the valley, are now covered with trim tea-gardens\u2014on the lower slopes the carefully-kept rows of tea-bushes, always above flood-level; half-way up, the coolie lines; on the summit, the planter's bungalow. The low lands, wherever possible, are under rice cultivation. The cottages of the people are buried in groves of tufted bamboo and shady fruit-trees.\n\nThe following are the principal ranges of hills:\u2014The B\u00e1rel range, forming the northern barrier of the valley and the boundary between North and South Cachar, varying in height from 2500 to 6000 feet; and on the south of the Bar\u00e1k, the Bhubans, the Rengti Pah\u00e1r, the Til\u00e1in, and the Saraspur or Siddheswar Hills, all running from south to north, with a height not exceeding 3000 feet. The absence of plateaux in the upper ranges is remarkable. In shape, the hills are ridged or peaked; some of them form long even ridges, some bristle up into peaks, while others are saddle-backed. The slopes are extremely precipitous, especially the Bhubans range. Most of the hills are covered with forest jungle, except where they have been cleared for jum cultivation, or in the case of the lower ranges, cultivated with the tea-plant. The Bar\u00e1k river runs a total course of about 130 miles through the District, first north and then west. Its bed is from 100 to 200 yards wide, and it is navigable throughout the year by boats of 20 tons burthen. Its chief tributaries within Cachar District are\u2014on the south bank, the Dhaleswari, together with its new channel known as the K\u00e1t\u00e1kh\u00e1l, the Gh\u00e1gra, and the Son\u00e1i; on the north bank, the Jiri, the J\u00e1ting\u00e1, the Madura, the Badr\u00ed, and the Chiri. The most important sheet of water in the District is the Ch\u00e1tl\u00e1 haor or fen, a low-lying tract between the Rengti Pah\u00e1r and Til\u00e1in hill ranges, which during the greater part of the year is drained by the Gh\u00e1gra river; but in the rainy season, the rainfall on the surrounding hills, assisted by the floods of the Bar\u00e1k, turns the marsh into a navigable lake 12 miles in length and 2 miles broad.\n\nTo the extreme south, the land above inundation-level is for the most part forest and jungle, but of late years there has been a considerable extension of rice cultivation in this direction. North of the Bar\u00e1k almost all the plain is cultivated. There is a constant succession of changes in the character of the country; and the rich vegetation and beautiful forms of the hills, the great fertility of the cultivated lands, the size and beauty of the bamboo groves and fruit-trees that surround the cottages of the people, and even the wild and primeval appearance\nof the great marshes, give a richness and picturesque variety to the scenery of Cachar which is generally wanting in the monotonous plains of Eastern Bengal. The soil of the valleys is an alluvial deposit of mixed sand and clay, in which clay predominates. On the hills and other elevated tracts, the surface is a rich vegetable mould, and the rocks underneath are composed of quartz, schist, and conglomerate.\n\nNo mines or minerals of any value are known to exist in Cachar. Discoveries of coal have been frequently reported, but on examination the deposits have invariably turned out to be anthracite or lignite, not worth working. Petroleum also has been discovered, but not utilized. The local demand for salt was formerly met from salt-wells; but a cheaper and better supply is now obtained from Bengal, and only one of the salt-wells is still worked. The great natural source of wealth to Cachar lies in her forests, which are practically inexhaustible. The two most valuable timber-trees are j\u0101rul (Lagerstroemia regin\u00e6) and n\u00e1gswar or n\u00e1gkesar (Mesua ferrea). Boats, logs, bamboos, canes, and thatching grass are exported to Bengal in large quantities. The wood-cutters pay licences at the rate of 2s. per head, and tolls are levied at Si\u00e1ltekh gh\u00e1t on the Bar\u00e1k river. In 1876\u201377, a total area of 745 square miles was declared Forest Reserves, and placed under regulations for conservancy. In 1881, the forests yielded a total revenue of \u00a32151. Caoutchouc, the produce of Ficus elastica, is collected chiefly beyond the frontiers of the District. In 1881\u201382, the registered export of caoutchouc from the two Districts of Cachar and Sylhet was 1466 maunds of 80 lbs. each, valued at \u00a35864. Recently, cinnamon and oak trees have been found in the newly-opened country of North Cachar, where the tea-plant also grows wild. The manufacture of tea-boxes gives employment to many. A saw-mill which a few years ago existed at Badrpur for the manufacture of tea-boxes has since been abandoned, and all the boxes are now made by hand. The wild animals found in the District include elephants, rhinoceros, buffaloes, the metn\u00e1 or wild cow, tigers, black bear, and many kinds of deer, including the s\u00e1mbhar and the bar\u00e1 singh\u00e1. The right of capturing wild elephants is a valuable monopoly of Government. The metn\u00e1 or wild cow (Bos gav\u00e6us) is domesticated by the hill tribes and kept for sacrificial purposes. The animal chiefly used for agriculture is the buffalo.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The Census of 1881 returned a population of 289,425 residing in the plains, and 24,433 scattered over the wild hilly tracts, making a total of 313,858. The Census of 1872 was confined to the regularly-settled portion of the District in the plains, or an area of 1285 square miles, out of a total of 3750 square miles, and showed a total population of 205,027 persons. The number of villages or mauzas in 1881 was in the plains 353, and of occupied houses 32,294, showing an average of 819 persons per village, and 8\u00b796 per house. Classified according to\nsex, there were in the plains 154,568 males and 134,857 females; proportion of males, 53\u00b74 per cent. This large preponderance of males is due to the presence of the coolies on the tea-gardens. The following figures relate to the hill tracts. Total population, 24,433, namely, 12,368 males and 12,065 females. Number of mauzas or village unions, 300, and of houses, 5,479, showing an average of 81\u00b75 persons per village, and 4\u00b747 per house. Hindus numbered 10,943, while there were only 3 Muhammadans and 2 Christians in this tract; the remaining 13,486 are made up of aboriginal tribes. Classified according to religion, the Hindus in the plains, as loosely grouped together for religious purposes, numbered 186,657, or 64\u00b75 per cent.; the Muhammadans, 92,393, or 31\u00b79 per cent.; Brahmos, 40; Christians, 765, or 2 per cent.; and hill tribes, 9570, or 3\u00b73 per cent.\n\nCachar is a remote and backward District, shut in between lofty hills, which has but recently come under the influence of Hindu civilisation. The population is largely composed of the neighbouring hill tribes, included among the general mass of Hindus in the religious classification just given. The chief aboriginal tribes are\u2014Cacharis, 4425 in the plains, and 10,890 in the hills; Kuk\u00eds, including the Lushai clan, 2794 in the plains, and 6420 in the hills; N\u00e1g\u00e1s, 5984 in the plains, and 4021 in the hills; and Mikirs, 659 in the plains, and 3045 in the hills. The number of immigrant coolies imported from Bengal and other parts of India in connection with the tea industry is returned at 66,363 (including children) born outside Assam, of whom a few are Christians, as against a locally-born coolie population numbering 20,730. Among the native population, the Manipur\u00eds occupy a prominent place, numbering 26,745, all found in the plains. They have migrated from the State of Manipur within the past fifty years, and though the majority now rank as Hindus, some have adopted Isl\u00e1m. They are the pioneers of cultivation on the skirts of the jungle, and are an industrious, peaceable race. The women weave excellent cotton cloth, known as Manipur\u00ed khes, which finds a market beyond the limits of the District; and also a kind of fine net, for mosquito curtains. The men manufacture brass vessels. The Kuk\u00eds, both in the hill tracts and in the plains, are all recent immigrants from the southern hills, and the majority live along the southern frontier. There is, however, a settlement of Old Kuk\u00eds, as they are termed, from having been the first immigrants of their race, on the north of the Bar\u00e1k river. Since the retaliatory expedition of 1871-72, the Kuk\u00eds have uniformly maintained friendly relations with the British officers, and a valuable trade has been opened at certain fixed marts on the frontier.\n\nThe population of Cachar is entirely engaged either in rice cultivation or on the tea-gardens. There is only one town with a population of more than 5000 souls, namely, Silchar, the civil station and head-\nquarters of a regiment of Native Infantry, which in 1881 contained 6567 inhabitants. In conjunction with the neighbouring villages, Silch\u00e1r has been constituted a municipality, with an income, in 1881\u201382, of \u00a31167; average rate of taxation, 1s. 8d. per head. A large trading fair is annually held here in January, attended by about 20,000 people. Other centres of trade are Sonai and Sialtek on the Bar\u00e1k; and Barkala, Udharban, Lakshmipur, and Hailakandi.\n\nAn interesting bond of social organization is to be found in the kh\u00e9ls or primitive agricultural partnerships, which still retain their vitality, and constitute the ordinary proprietary bodies throughout the District. These kh\u00e9ls, which differ in several important respects from the village communities of the rest of India, are variously explained either as a relic of the indigenous revenue system of the great Cachari kingdom, or as an invention of the Bengali Hindus to protect themselves from the exactions of the R\u00e1j\u00e1. Properly speaking, each kh\u00e9l consists of a band of individuals, bound together by no real or fancied tie of blood, nor even by community of race or religion, but merely associated for purposes of common profit. For collection of revenue, the State did not look to the individual cultivator, but to the mukht\u00e1r or head-man of the kh\u00e9l, who was primarily responsible. At the same time, the members of the kh\u00e9l were held jointly and severally liable for the default of any of their number; and the property of a defaulter, in accordance with a principle still known as ghos\u00e1ivat, was made over to the kh\u00e9l to which he belonged. A certain number of kh\u00e9ls were comprehended in a larger corporation, called a r\u00e1j. Such was the fiscal and agricultural system of Cachar when the British took possession of the country in 1830. The conception of individual property, and separate liability for the Government revenue, has been gradually substituted for it; but the machinery of the kh\u00e9l still retains a strong hold upon the sentiments of the people, and is continually reappearing at the present day as an anomaly in the administration.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014The staple crop of Cachar is rice, which yields three harvests in the year\u2014(1) the \u00e1us, or early harvest; (2) the s\u00e1il, which is transplanted, and supplies by far the greater portion of the food-supply; (3) the \u00e1sr\u00e1 or \u00e1man, which is sown broadcast. The s\u00e1il crop is sown in nurseries in June, transplanted into low-lying fields in the following month, and reaped about December or January. The minor crops comprise mustard, linseed, pulses, sugar-cane, chillies, and vegetables. Cultivation has rapidly extended since the date of British annexation, but even at the present time a very small proportion of the total area is under tillage. In 1830, the total cultivated area was estimated at 29,000 acres. By 1881\u201382, the amount had risen to 256,000 acres, or nearly nine-fold; but this is still only 10 per cent. of the total surveyed area of the District. Almost the whole cultivated area is under\nrice, excepting the tea lands. The statistics of tea cultivation are given below. The land revenue is assessed by Government direct with the cultivators, locally known as mir\u00e1sd\u00edrs. The last term of assessment was for 20 years, which expired in 1879. The present term of assessment is for 15 years, and the rates fixed vary from 3s. per acre for first-class land, and from 1s. 8d. per acre for second-class land. Leases for a term of years, with favourable conditions, are granted for jungle reclamation. The animals used in agriculture are buffaloes and bullocks. Manure is never used except for the sugar-cane crop. Irrigation is nowhere practised on an extensive scale; but in exceptional years, when the rainfall is deficient, water is thrown upon the rice-fields out of the neighbouring marshes and artificial channels. Spare land is abundant, and the fields are never allowed to lie fallow as a deliberate stage in the process of agriculture, nor is any rotation of crops practised. The output of rice varies from 5 to 11 cwts. to 30 cwts. per acre, the proportion of rice to paddy being about as 5 is to 8. Actual famine has never been known in Cachar. Drought, flood, and blight occasionally occur, but not to such an extent as to affect the general harvest. The local production of rice is inadequate to satisfy the local demand, augmented by the large number of labourers on the tea-gardens. The deficiency is supplied from the neighbouring District of Sylhet, whence it is estimated that 300,000 maunds of rice are imported every year.\n\nManufactures, Trade, etc.\u2014Coarse cotton cloth is spun and woven by the male members of Hindu castes, and by the women of the hill tribes. The only special manufactures are a cotton cloth called Manipur\u00ed khesh, and a fine net, for mosquito curtains, both woven by the Manipuri women; and par\u00eds or rugs made by the Kuk\u00ed women. Near Badrpur, and just inside Sylhet District, there is a colony of Manipuri braziers. Most of the tea-boxes required on the gardens are made in the District, from the produce of the neighbouring jungles.\n\nThe foreign trade of Cachar is entirely conducted by water, passing by the Bar\u00e1k river through the neighbouring District of Sylhet. The chief item of export is tea. The imports comprise cotton piece-goods, rice, liquors, tea-seed, iron, and woollen goods. The more valuable commodities are carried in steamers, which can navigate the Bar\u00e1k within Cachar District only during the rainy season; the more bulky goods in native boats. There are no large centres of trade in the District. The wants of the coolies are chiefly supplied by means of b\u00e1z\u00e1rs on the tea-gardens, and at three large annual fairs, held at Silch\u00e1r, Siddheswar, and Hail\u00e1k\u00e1ndi. A brisk trade is conducted with the Kuk\u00ed tribes on the southern frontier. Three recognised marts have been opened, to which the Kukis bring down caoutchouc, cotton, ivory, wax, and par\u00ed rugs, to exchange for rice,\nsalt, tobacco, brass-ware, etc. The trade with Manipur is said to be on the decline. The local traffic of the District passes by road rather than by water. The enterprise of the tea-planters has constructed, and now maintains, a very complete system of roads, by which communication is established between their gardens and the river Bar\u00e1k. In 1881, the number of miles of road open was 266, maintained at a cost of \u00a34300.\n\n**Tea Cultivation and Manufacture.**\u2014The tea-plant was discovered growing wild in Cachar in 1855, and the first grant of land for a tea-garden was made in the following year. Reckless speculation in the promotion of tea companies led to a severe depression, which reached its crisis about 1868; but since that date the industry has recovered, and now makes rapid and regular progress. In 1881, the total area taken up for tea was 211,812 acres, of which 43,563 acres were under plant; the total out-turn was 10,455,982 lbs., being just double the out-turn of 1873. The average monthly number of labourers employed was 36,681, of whom 15,749 were imported from Bengal. The land for tea-gardens has been acquired direct from Government, either on long leases or by sales in fee-simple. It is estimated that a total sum of \u00a3250,000 in coin and notes is annually introduced into the District in connection with this industry. A full account of the processes of cultivation of the plant and preparation of the leaf will be found in the *Statistical Account of Assam*, vol. ii. pp. 434\u2013445.\n\n**Administration.**\u2014In the year 1870\u201371, the total revenue of Cachar District amounted to \u00a336,711, and the expenditure to \u00a325,291. The principal items among the receipts were\u2014land revenue, \u00a317,956; opium, \u00a32855; excise, \u00a37609; stamps, \u00a38467; forest revenue, \u00a32151. District details of revenue and expenditure are not available to me for a later year. In 1880, the regular police force consisted of 608 officers and men, maintained at a cost of \u00a311,773. The District also maintains a municipal police in Silch\u00e1r of 9 constables, and a body of rural watchmen or chaukid\u00e1rs, supported by the villagers, and numbering 4376 in 1880. The jail at Silch\u00e1r, and subsidiary jail at Hail\u00e1k\u00e1ndi, contained in 1882 an average daily number of 12121 prisoners, including 923 females.\n\nWithin the last few years, education has made considerable progress in Cachar, under the stimulus of Sir G. Campbell's reforms, by which the benefit of the grant-in-aid rules has been extended to the p\u00e1th\u00eds\u00e1l\u00e1s or village schools. Between March 1872 and March 1881, the total number of schools in the District increased from 6 to 100.\n\nFor administrative purposes, Cachar District is divided into 3 Sub-divisions, with head-quarters at Silch\u00e1r, Hail\u00e1k\u00e1ndi, and Gunjong. The Silch\u00e1r Sub-division is further divided into 3 th\u00e1n\u00e1s or police circles. For fiscal purposes, the settled portion of the District is divided into\n3 tahsils, comprehending 24 pargan\u00e1s. In 1882, there were 2 covenanted civil servants stationed in the District. There were also 3 extra-Assistant Commissioners, with powers of a munsif or civil judge; 1 Special extra-Assistant Commissioner; and 3 special Deputy Collectors, with magisterial powers. The last were employed in the land settlement of the District.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate of Cachar differs from that common to Eastern Bengal in being less hot and more damp. The rainy season lasts from April to October, and during the remaining months of the year dense fogs are of frequent occurrence. The average mean temperature throughout the year is about $77^\\circ$ F., the range of variation being $32^\\circ$. The average annual rainfall for the five years ending 1880\u201381 was 120.17 inches at Silch\u00e1r, and 108.59 at Hailakandi. As lying within the mountainous tract that bounds North-Eastern India, Cachar is especially exposed to earthquakes. In January 1869, a shock of unusual severity occurred, which laid in ruins the greater part of the town of Silch\u00e1r, changed the course of the rivers in several places, and did damage throughout the District to the estimated value of \u00a350,000. Another severe earthquake, which did considerable damage to the town and its neighbourhood, occurred on the 13th October 1882.\n\nThe prevailing diseases are fevers, diarrhoea, dysentery, cholera, and small-pox. Intermittent fever usually appears every year, after the cessation of the rains. Outbreaks of cholera are attributed to importation from Bengal, and it has been observed that the path of this epidemic regularly follows the course of the river and other lines of communication. In recent years, by reason of the spread of cultivation and the adoption of sanitary measures, the general health of the people has sensibly improved. The registration of vital statistics is very imperfectly carried out. There are 2 charitable dispensaries in the District, attended in 1881 by 631 in-patients and 7434 out-door patients; the total expenditure was \u00a3603, towards which Government contributed \u00a345, including the cost of European medicines, the balance being derived from local funds and subscriptions.\n\nCalastri.\u2014Zamindari (estate) in the District of North Arcot, Madras Presidency.\u2014See KALAHASTI.\n\nCalcutta.\u2014The capital of India, and seat of the Supreme Government; situated on the east or left bank of the H\u00fagl\u00ed river, in lat. $22^\\circ 34' 2''$ N., and long. $88^\\circ 23' 59''$ E. It lies about 80 miles from the seaboard, and receives the accumulated produce which the two great river systems of the Ganges and the Brahmaputra collect throughout the Provinces of Bengal and Assam. From a cluster of three mud villages at the close of the 17th century, it has advanced by rapid strides to a densely-inhabited metropolis. With its surrounding\nsuburbs, and the town of Howrah on the opposite side of the river, which is practically a portion of Calcutta, it contained in 1881 a population of 789,864 souls. The central portion, which forms the Calcutta municipality, had a population in 1881 of 433,219. In 1881-82, its maritime trade amounted to nearly 60 millions sterling; but it fluctuates, according to the state of commerce, from 50 to 75 millions. Taking it at about 55 millions sterling, the exports make up 33 millions and the imports 22, showing an excess of exports over imports of about 11 millions sterling.\n\nThe History of Calcutta practically dates from the year 1686. In 1596, it had obtained a brief entry as a rent-paying village, 'Kalikata,' in the Ain-i-Akbari, or Revenue Survey, executed by command of the Emperor Akbar. But it was not till ninety years later that it emerged into history. In 1686, the English merchants at H\u00fagl\u00ed, finding themselves compelled to quit their factory in consequence of a rupture with the Mughal authorities, retreated under their President, Job Charnock, to Sut\u00e1nat\u00ed, about 26 miles down the river from H\u00fagl\u00ed town. Sut\u00e1nat\u00ed, then a village on the east bank of the H\u00fagl\u00ed, is now a northern quarter of Calcutta, extending to the present Chitpur Bridge. Their new settlement soon extended itself down the river bank to the village of Kalikata, between the present Customs House and the Mint; and afterwards down to Govindpur, which lay on the southern glacis of the present Fort William. Govindpur formed part of what is now the maid\u00e1n or great Calcutta plain, and included the existing suburb of Hastings on the river bank. These three river-side hamlets (namely, Sut\u00e1nat\u00ed, Kalikata, and Govindpur) have grown into the capital of India. In 1689-90, the Bengal servants of the East India Company determined to make Calcutta their head-quarters. In 1696 they built the original Fort William; and in 1700, they formally purchased the three villages of Sut\u00e1nat\u00ed, Kalikata, and Govindpur from Prince Azfm, son of the Emperor Aurangzeb.\n\nThe site thus chosen had an excellent anchorage, and was defended by the river from the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, who harried the Districts on the farther side. A fort, subsequently rebuilt on the Vauban principle, and a moat designed in 1742 to surround the town, but never completed, combined with the natural position of Calcutta to render it one of the safest places for trade in India during the expiring struggles of the Mughal Empire. It grew up without any fixed plan, and with little regard to the sanitary arrangements required for a city. Some parts lie beneath high-water mark on the H\u00fagl\u00ed, and its low level has rendered drainage a most difficult problem. Until far on in the last century, the jungle and paddy fields closely hemmed in the European mansions with a circle of malaria. The vast plain (maid\u00e1n), with its gardens and promenades, where the fashion of Calcutta now\ndisplays itself every evening, was then a swamp during three months of each year; the spacious quadrangle known as Wellington Square was a filthy creek. A legend relates how one-fourth of the European inhabitants perished in twelve months, and during seventy years the mortality was so great that the name of Calcutta was supposed by mariners to be derived from 'Golgotha,' the place of a skull. The true derivation of the word will be explained in the subsequent paragraph on Modern Calcutta.\n\nIn 1707, the East India Company declared Calcutta a separate Presidency, accountable to the Court of Directors in London. In 1710, it contained about 10,000 or 12,000 inhabitants. In 1717, after suffering many oppressions from the Muhammadan Governors of Bengal, the Calcutta Council obtained a confirmation of all their privileges from the Delhi Emperor, together with permission to purchase thirty-eight neighbouring villages, on both banks of the H\u00fagl\u00ed, to a distance of 10 miles down the river. In 1742, the native inhabitants, in terror of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 horse, who were then scouring Southern Bengal, 'requested and obtained permission to dig a ditch at their own expense round the Company's boundary;' a semicircle of 7 miles from S\u00fat\u00e1n\u00e1t\u00ed on the north to Govindpur on the south. Three miles of it were excavated in six months; the alarm then passed off, and the 'Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 Ditch' remains unfinished to this day. Meanwhile, the Company was only the zam\u00ednd\u00e1r or landholder of the Calcutta hamlets, paying a revenue to the Musalm\u00e1n Naw\u00e1b, at first (1696) of \u00a3120, afterwards increased (1717) to \u00a3884. It had no power to enhance rents beyond Sicca Rs. 3 per bigha, say 20s. per acre. In 1752, Holwell calculated the population at 409,056\u2014probably an excessive estimate.\n\nThe chief event in the history of Calcutta is the sack of the town and the capture of Fort William in 1756, by Sur\u00e1j-ud-Daul\u00e1, the Naw\u00e1b of Bengal. The majority of the English officials took ship, and fled to the mouth of the H\u00fagl\u00ed river. The European garrison in the fort were compelled, after a short resistance, to surrender themselves to the young prince. The prisoners, numbering 146 persons, were driven at the point of the sword into the cell used for military defaulters\u2014a chamber scarcely 20 feet square, with but two small windows. Next morning only twenty-three persons were taken out alive, among them Mr. Holwell, the annalist of the 'Black Hole.' This event took place on June 20, 1756. The Black Hole has lately been excavated, and its dimensions bear witness to the horrors of the fatal mistake of that night. It lies at the present entrance from Dalhousie Square to the lane at the back of the General Post Office; and the spot has now been marked by a pavement.\n\nThe Muhammadans retained possession of Calcutta for about seven months (1756); and during that brief period the name of the town was\nchanged in official documents to Alinagar. In January 1757, the expedition despatched from Madras, under the command of Admiral Watson and Colonel Clive, regained possession of the city. They found many of the houses of the English residents demolished, and others damaged by fire. The old church of St. John's lay in ruins. The native portion of the town had also suffered much. Everything of value had been swept away, except the merchandise of the Company within the Fort, which had been reserved for the Naw\u00e1b. The battle of Plassey was fought on June 23, 1757, just twelve months after the capture of Calcutta. Mir Jafar, the nominee of the English, was created Naw\u00e1b of Bengal; and by the treaty which raised him to this position, he agreed to make restitution to the Calcutta merchants for their losses. The English received \u00a3500,000, the Hindus and Muhammadans \u00a3200,000, and the Armenians \u00a370,000. By another clause in this treaty the Company was permitted to establish a mint, the visible sign in India of territorial sovereignty; and the first coin, which, however, still bore the name of the Delhi Emperor, was issued on August 19, 1757. The restitution money was divided among the sufferers by a committee of respectable inhabitants. Commerce rapidly revived, and the ruined city was rebuilt. Modern Calcutta dates from 1757. The old fort was abandoned, and its site devoted to the Customs House and other Government offices. A new fort, the present Fort William, was commenced by Clive, at a short distance lower down the river H\u00fagli than the old one. It was not finished till 1773, and is said to have cost 2 millions sterling. At this time, also, the maid\u00e1n, or park of Calcutta, was formed; and the salubrity of its position induced the European inhabitants gradually to shift their dwellings eastward, and to occupy what is now the Chauringhi (Chowringhee) quarter.\n\nFrom that time, the history of Calcutta presents a smooth narrative of prosperity. No outbreak of civil war nor any episode of disaster has disturbed its progress, nor have the calamities incident to the climate ever wrought mischief which could not be easily repaired. The great park (maid\u00e1n), intersected by roads, and ornamented by a public garden, stretches along the river bank. The fort rises from the maid\u00e1n on its western side, and defends it from the river approach; the stately mansions of Chauringhi line its eastern flank; while Government House, the Gothic High Court, the domed Post Office, and other public buildings, tower in fine architectural masses at its northern end. Beyond the European quarter lie the densely-populated clusters of huts or 'villages' which compose the native city and suburbs. Several squares, with large reservoirs and gardens, adorn the city, and broad, well-metalled streets connect its various extremities. A Sanitary Department now attempts the difficult task of introducing\ncleanliness into the native quarter. The old contrast which travellers have recorded between European Calcutta as a city of palaces, and native Calcutta as a city of filth, is not quite so strongly marked. On the one hand, the English houses are less splendid; on the other, the native bastis are somewhat cleaner and more commodious. This change has of late years gone on so rapidly, that it may be well to extract from the Census Report of 1872 the following descriptions of Calcutta by four eye-witnesses during the latter half of the last century and early in the present one.\n\nCalcutta in the last century.\u2014Towards the end of the last century, the native town, which then as now lay apart from the English quarter, was thus described:\n\n'It is a truth that, from the western extremity of California, to the eastern coast of Japan, there is not a spot where judgment, taste, decency, and convenience are so grossly insulted as in that scattered and confused chaos of houses, huts, sheds, streets, lanes, alleys, windings, gutters, sinks, and tanks, which, jumbled into an undistinguished mass of filth and corruption, equally offensive to human sense and health, compose the capital of the English Company's Government in India. The very small portion of cleanliness which it enjoys is owing to the familiar intercourse of hungry jackals by night, and ravenous vultures, kites, and crows by day. In like manner it is indebted to the smoke raised in public streets, in temporary huts and sheds, for any respite it enjoys from mosquitoes, the natural production of stagnated and putrid waters.'\n\nNine years later, Grandpr\u00e9 thus describes the town:\n\n'As we enter the town, a very extensive square opens before us, with a large piece of water in the middle for the public use [now known as Tank Square or Dalhousie Square]. The pond has a grass plot round it, and the whole is enclosed by a wall breast-high with a railing on the top. The sides of this enclosure are each nearly 500 yards in length. The square itself is composed of magnificent houses, which render Calcutta not only the handsomest town in Asia, but one of the finest in the world. One side of the square consists of a range of buildings occupied by persons in civil appointments under the Company, such as writers in the public offices. Part of the side towards the river is taken up by the old fort, which was the first citadel built by the English after their establishment in Bengal.\n\n'Calcutta abounds with all sorts of carriages, chariots, whiskies, and phaetons, which occasion in the evening as great a bustle as in one of the principal towns in Europe. On the other hand, such animals as die in the streets or in the houses are thrown into the drains, and they lie there and putrefy. From want, sickness, or accident, many a\npoor wretch of the human species also expires in the streets. I have seen the body of a poor creature, lying dead at my door, serve two nights for food to the jackals.'\n\nIn 1803, Lord Valentia remarked:\u2014'The town of Calcutta is at present well worthy of being the seat of our Indian Government, both from its size, and from the magnificent buildings which decorate the part of it inhabited by Europeans. Chowringhee is an entire village of palaces, and altogether forms the finest view I ever beheld in any city. The Black Town, however, is as complete a contrast to this as can well be conceived. Its streets are narrow and dirty, but the houses [sometimes] of two storeys, occasionally brick, but generally mud and thatched, perfectly resemble the cabins of the poorest class in Ireland.'\n\n'The universal custom of the natives,' writes Price, 'when they obtain a small spot on which to build a hut, is to dig a hole, raise one part of the ground with the earth from the other, and make the walls of their house of the same materials from the same place, and then cover it with straw tied on reeds or split bamboos; the hole in the ground is made smooth, and as deep as they can, and when the periodical rains set in, it becomes a little pond or tank, in which they wash their bodies and clothes, as directed by their religion. Vegetation is so quick and powerful, and shade so necessary, that in six months' time the little hut is absolutely hid from the eyes, and almost from the knowledge of everybody but the inhabitants of neighbouring huts. A little path of a foot or two broad is all those harmless people want to go from home into the common highway leading to the public market. Thousands of these huts are run up wherever they are permitted to build near European settlements. . . . Much ground was cleared to make room for a new fort; many thousand huts thrown into the holes from whence they had been taken, to form roads and an esplanade; but every man who lost a hut had ground given him on which to make another, and always of more extent and more value than what had been taken away from him.\n\n'Much was done by Governor Vansittart, Lord Clive, Governor Verelst, Governor Cartier, and Governor Hastings, to cleanse the town and make it wholesome and convenient. When Mr. Hastings came to the government, he added some new regulations, and gave a degree more power to the officers of police, divided the Black and White Town into thirty-five wards, and purchased the consent of the natives to go a little farther off.\n\n'There are no stones, gravel, or other hard substances within 50 leagues of Calcutta with which to mend the roads. Burnt and broken bricks are all the materials we have, and very expensive they are; for lay them down as thick as you will, so rotten is the soil that in two\nyears' time they will be sunk a fathom deep. With Mr. Francis came the Judges of the Supreme Court, the laws of England, partial oppression, and licentious liberty; . . . and the natives were made to know that they might erect their chappor (thatched) huts in what part of the town they pleased. . . . Every man permitted his own servants to erect straw huts against the outside of his house, but without digging holes, to prevent more disagreeable neighbours from occupying the spot. All distinction of character and order was thrown down, as much as if there had been a civil war in the town; and in fact there was a civil and a judicial war too, for the Council-General and Supreme Court, who both arrived at the same time, went together by the ears about their different powers, and every inhabitant in the town, black and white, did that which seemed best to be done in his own eyes.\n\n'In August and September, the waters from the inland Provinces came down, in consequence of the heavy periodical fall of rain, in such inundations that at the high water at Calcutta, which is twice in twenty-four hours, the level of the lower part of the town is four feet below the surface of the river. At this time of the year it rains incessantly, and all the lower floors of common houses are under water, except such as stand near to the old fort, or where the first European houses were built.'\n\nIn the last century, the morals of Calcutta were at a low ebb. European ladies were scarce, nor do they seem to have exercised a refining influence. Until the third quarter of the century, many of the best European houses had regular quarters for a zan\u00e1na in the compound. Nor was a gentleman excluded from ladies' society, nor indeed thought the worse of, in consequence of his keeping a harem of native mistresses. Indeed, such an establishment was considered as essential to the dignity of a bachelor of position as 'the State horses of a Native prince.' 'The Company's servants,' writes Stavorinus, the Dutch traveller in 1769, 'devote a part of the morning to attending upon their business; they spend the remainder of the time either in revels or sleep.'\n\nHow Calcutta became the Capital of India.\u2014Until 1707, when Calcutta was declared a Presidency, it had been dependent upon the older English Settlements at Madras. From 1707 to 1773, the Presidencies of Madras, Bombay, and Bengal remained on a nearly equal footing. But in 1773, an Act of Parliament provided that the Bengal Council should exercise a control over the other Indian possessions of the Company; that the chief of the Bengal Presidency should be styled Governor-General; and that a Supreme Court of Judicature should be established at Calcutta. In the previous year, 1772, Warren Hastings had placed the administration of Bengal under the management of the Company's servants\u2014an administration which till then had been left in the hands of the old Muhammadan officials. He also removed the\ntreasury from Murshid\u00e1b\u00e1d to Calcutta. The latter town thus became both the capital of Bengal and the seat of the Central Government in India.\n\nIn 1834, the Governor-General of Bengal was created Governor-General of India, and was permitted to appoint a Deputy Governor to manage the affairs of Lower Bengal during his occasional absence. But it was not until 1854 that a separate head was appointed for Bengal, who, under the style of Lieutenant-Governor, exercises the same powers in civil matters as those vested in the Governors in Council of Madras or Bombay, although subject to closer supervision by the Supreme Government. Calcutta is thus at present the seat both of the Supreme Government of India, and of the Provincial Government of Bengal, each with an independent set of offices. Government House, the official residence of the Governor-General of India, or Viceroy, is a magnificent pile rising to the north of the fort and the great park, maid\u00e1n. It was built by Lord Wellesley, 1799\u20131804. The official residence of the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal is Belvedere, in Alipur, a southern suburb of Calcutta. Proposals have been made from time to time to remove the seat of the Supreme Government from Calcutta. Its unhealthiness, especially in the rainy season, its remoteness from the centre of Hindust\u00e1n, and its distance from England, have each been animadverted upon. These disadvantages have now, however, been in some degree removed, or their consequences mitigated, by the efforts of science and modern engineering. The railway and the telegraph have brought the Viceroy at Calcutta into close contact with every corner of India; while an ample water-supply, improved drainage, and other reforms, have improved the health of the city. Much, however, still remains to be done for the sanitation both of the town and suburbs.\n\nEnglish civilisation has thus enabled Calcutta to remain the political capital of India. The same agency still secures to the city her monopoly of the sea-borne trade of Bengal. The river H\u00fagl\u00ed has long ceased to be the main channel of the Ganges; but Calcutta alone of all the successive river capitals of Bengal has overcome the difficulties incident to its position as a deltaic centre of commerce. Strenuous efforts of engineering are required to keep open the 'Nadiy\u00e1 rivers,' namely, the three offshoots of the Ganges which combine to form the head-waters of the H\u00fagl\u00ed. Still greater watchfulness is demanded by the H\u00fagl\u00ed itself below Calcutta. In 1853, the deterioration of the H\u00fagl\u00ed channel led to a proposal to found an auxiliary port to Calcutta on the Matl\u00e1, another mouth of the Ganges. A committee, then appointed to inquire into the subject, reported (not unanimously, however) that the river H\u00fagl\u00ed was deteriorating gradually and progressively. At that time 'science had done nothing to aid in facilities\nfor navigation,' but since then everything has been effected which foresight can suggest. Observations on the condition of the river are taken almost hourly, and the shifting of the shoals is carefully recorded. By these means the port of Calcutta has been kept open for ships of the largest tonnage drawing 26 feet, and almost seems to have outlived the danger which threatened it. The construction of large wet docks from the H\u00fagl\u00ed at Kidderpur, just below Calcutta, has been sanctioned. A new approach from the sea to these docks, via the Matla river and a navigable canal, has been talked of.\n\nThe Modern City of Calcutta.\u2014The true derivation of the name of the city appears to be from K\u00e1l\u00ed-gh\u00e1t, the well-known shrine to the goddess K\u00e1l\u00ed, close to the old course of the Ganges, or Adi-Gang\u00e1, about a mile to the south of the Calcutta outskirts. The neighbouring country was known as K\u00e1l\u00ed-kshetra in very remote times. The Adi-Gang\u00e1 is still venerated as the ancient channel by which the Ganges poured her purifying waters towards the ocean, before they were diverted into the present H\u00fagl\u00ed. This old course, in many parts now little more than a series of depressions and shallow pools, is marked by shrines and burning gh\u00e1ts for the dead along its route. Among such shrines, K\u00e1l\u00ed-gh\u00e1t, although the present temple is of comparatively modern date, has been celebrated since the prehistoric era of the Sanskrit Epic poems. When Charnock settled on the banks of the H\u00fagl\u00ed, in 1686, a pilgrim road ran through a thick jungle along the line of the present Chauringhi. This path proceeded via the Chitpur road through marshes and woods, now the site of Calcutta. At Chitpur it joined the old highway to Mursid\u00e1b\u00e1d and the north. The nearest village to the shrine of K\u00e1l\u00ed-gh\u00e1t (the village through which the Chitpur road passed) was the Moslemized 'Kalikata' of the Ain-i-Akbar\u00ed, or Revenue Survey of 1596, and is the Anglicized 'Calcutta' of the present day. A forest, interspersed with swamps, and infested by wild beasts and robbers, lay between the shrine and the village. That forest has now given place to the fashionable quarters of Chauringhi and Theatre Road, together with the adjoining maid\u00e1n, except the strip along the river bank, which was dotted by the old hamlet of Govindpur. As late as the second half of the last century, Warren Hastings shot tigers in the jungle that now forms the fine open space upon which the Cathedral is built. Servants engaged at 'country houses' in that neighbourhood (then a solitary suburb, now covered with some of the best streets of Calcutta) put off their clothes and valuables before going to their homes for the night, lest they should be stripped by robbers on the way.\n\nChauringhi, with its northern continuations, Bentinck Street and the Chitpur Road, forms, therefore, one of the most ancient pilgrim-routes in Bengal; and this line was destined to become the central street through the modern city of Calcutta. The shrine of K\u00e1l\u00ed-gh\u00e1t stood at\nthe southern end of it, while the northern end was celebrated for the temple of Chiteswar\u00ed, which gave its name to the ancient village of Chitpur, now a northern suburb of Calcutta. For about a century after Charnock's settlement in 1686, the English town clustered round the old Fort, which occupied the site of the present Customs House and Post-Office. By degrees it crept along the river bank, both north and south, while the country houses of the wealthier English residents gradually extended as far as Chitpur at the northern end of the central route, and Alipur at its south-western extremity. The maid\u00e1n, or great open plain, was cleared of jungle, partly for the new or present Fort William (built 1757\u20131773), after the battle of Plassey and the diw\u00e1n\u00ed grant had given Bengal to the English. But the southern corner of the maid\u00e1n, together with the now fashionable quarter of Theatre Road which skirts it, remained for some time a swampy and jungly tract. Until the middle of the present century, the Chitpur road still divided the English mercantile part of Calcutta along the river from the native villages or bast\u00eds which clustered inward to the east of it. By degrees, however, two inner main routes were formed from north to south, running nearly parallel to Chauringhi and its continuation, the Chitpur road. The middle of the three routes is now represented (beginning from the south) by Wood Street, Wellesley Street, College Street, and Cornwallis Street. The eastern or most inland of the three routes is the Circular Road, which still nominally marks the eastern boundary of Calcutta. The northern part of the Circular Road is formed from the d\u00e9bris thrown up from the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 Ditch, when that ancient defence was erected against the predatory hordes in 1742. A section of it runs along the route of the Ditch itself, after it was partly filled up, by orders of the Marquis of Wellesley, at the beginning of the present century.\n\nThese three lines, running nearly parallel to the river on the west, are intersected by a number of cross streets connecting them with the bank of the H\u00fagl\u00ed. The most important of the intersecting streets running east and west are now (beginning from the north) Sobh\u00e1 B\u00e1z\u00e1r (starting inland from the H\u00fagl\u00ed bank), with its eastern continuation, Grey Street, called after a former Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, Sir William Grey; Nimt\u00e1l\u00e1 (from the H\u00fagl\u00ed bank), with its eastern continuation, Beadon Street, called after Sir Cecil Beadon, another Lieutenant-Governor; Cotton Street, with its eastern continuation, Machua B\u00e1z\u00e1r Road; Canning Street, called after Lord Canning, the Governor-General (starting from the river bank), with its eastern continuations, Kulat\u00e1l\u00e1 and Mirz\u00e1pur Streets; L\u00e1l B\u00e1z\u00e1r, with its eastern continuations, Bow B\u00e1z\u00e1r and B\u00e1\u00edt\u00e1kh\u00e1na; the Esplanade, with its eastern continuation, Dharmt\u00e1la Street, starting inland from the north-eastern corner of the maid\u00e1n or open plain. From this point the\nmaid\u00e1n stretches between the river bank on the west and Chauringhi, with the residential part of the modern city. It contains the cricket ground and the Eden Gardens on the river-side at its north-eastern end. The modern Fort William occupies an extensive site on the H\u00fagl\u00ed bank, below the Eden Gardens; while farther down the river, the southern end of the maid\u00e1n contains the suburb of Hastings on the bank with the Ellenborough course and race-course, a little inland to the east. A large grassy park, studded with trees, stretches inland from the Eden Gardens, the Fort, and Hastings, to Chauringhi Road. Chauringhi is lined with magnificent houses, about 60 of which occupy a mile and a half of road from north to south. This line of noble structures, facing the open plain, is connected with the fashionable European quarter behind it on the east, by three main routes running nearly east and west, Park Street, Theatre Road, and Lower Circular Road.\n\nPractically speaking, the European commerce of Calcutta is concentrated between the river bank on the west and Chitpur Road on the east, with Canning Street on the north and the Esplanade on the south. Its centre may be taken at the Post-Office, which practically marks the site of the original Fort William. The road along the river bank is known as the Strand, and has for the most part been reclaimed from the river by successive embankments constructed during the past fifty years. The European retail trading quarter lies within a small area inland to the east of the commercial centre. The residential European quarter, as already stated, runs along the Chauringhi side of the maid\u00e1n, and inland from that stately line of mansions.\n\nThe Native Quarters of Modern Calcutta skirt the European quarters on the north and east. The large native produce firms occupy, however, the north-eastern portion of the space which has been mentioned as the seat of the European commerce, towards Canning Street. The native shippers chiefly frequent the river-side streets northward from Canning Street up the H\u00fagl\u00ed. But everywhere beyond the European quarter, Calcutta is interspersed with bast\u00eds, or native hamlets of mud huts. As we proceed eastwards or inland from the Chitpur road, these bast\u00eds become numerous, until they form the great outlying suburbs which surround Calcutta on the north, east, and south. The growth of the European quarters, and the municipal clearings demanded by improved sanitation, are pushing these mud hamlets outwards in all directions, but especially towards the east. Price's description of them in the last century has been quoted; and some of them remain in the same filthy and unhealthy state at the present day. They form the despair of municipal reformers and of the sanitary authorities, but the work of improvement is steadily, although slowly, going forward among them. They have given rise to the reproach that Calcutta, while a city of palaces in front, is one of pig-styes in the rear.\nMonuments and Public Buildings.\u2014Calcutta is justly celebrated for its monuments. Perhaps the most conspicuous is the tall column towards the north-eastern end of the open plain or maid\u00e1n, in honour of Sir David Ochterlony. 'For fifty years a soldier, he had served in every Indian war from the time of Hyder downwards,' to nearly 1823. It rises 165 feet, with a Saracenic capital, and presents a noble view of the city from its top. Among the monuments to Governors-General may be mentioned those of Lord William Bentinck (1828\u20131835); Lord Hardinge (1844\u201348); Lord Lawrence (1864\u201368), and Lord Mayo (1869\u20131872). An enumeration of the Calcutta monuments is, however, beyond the scope of this article. One of them is remarkable for beauty of design and spirited execution. The bronze equestrian statue to Sir James Outram, 'The Bayard of the East,' rises on the Chauringhi side of the great park, opposite the United Service Club. It represents the hero with drawn sword, looking round to his troops, and cheering them forward. Nothing can exceed the lifelike action of both man and horse; and although unveiled by the Commander-in-Chief as long ago as 1874, it still attracts groups of native gazers every day, and forms a favourite rendezvous, round which the European children of Calcutta play with their nurses in the evening. It is an admirable example of Foley's work; and to this artist the city also owes several others of its most successful statues.\n\nThe present Government House stands at the northern end of the great park or maid\u00e1n, and separates it from the European commercial quarter. As already mentioned, it was built by Lord Wellesley, who held that 'India should be governed from a palace, not from a counting-house; with the ideas of a prince, and not with those of a retail dealer in muslins and indigo.' During the second half of the last century, part of its site had been occupied by Warren Hastings' town residence, and as appears from a plan of Calcutta in 1792, also by the old Government House and Council House. It was commenced in 1799, and finished in 1804, at a cost of \u00a38000 for the ground, \u00a3130,000 for the building, and \u00a35000 for the first furnishing; total, about \u00a3150,000, or at the present value of silver, about \u00a3175,000. The grounds occupy about 6 acres, and the design was adapted from Lord Scarsdale's seat of Kedleston Hall, Derbyshire, built by Robert Adam. Four great wings run to each point of the compass, from a central pile approached by a magnificent flight of steps on the north. The Grand Hall is one of the finest chambers in any palace; and besides the apartments for the Viceroy and his staff, the building contains the Council Chamber in which the Supreme Legislature holds its sittings. Some of the paintings have a historical interest, but not many of them possess high artistic value. The series of Governors-General is neither so complete nor so deficient in pictorial merit as the\nremarkable series of Portuguese Viceroys in the Government House at Goa. Various articles of furniture and trophies recall the perilous early days of the Company, having been captured from the European or native powers. The two fine full-length portraits of Louis le Bien Aim\u00e9 and his queen, with the chandeliers, and twelve busts of the Caesars in the aisles of the Marble Hall, are said to have been taken from a French ship.\n\nThe High Court.\u2014To the west of Government House, nearer to the river, stands the High Court. This imposing structure, in somewhat florid Gothic, was completed in 1872, on the site of the old Supreme Court. The design is said to have been suggested by the Town Hall at Ypres; the front is faced with stone, and the capitals of the pillars of the grand colonnade are beautifully sculptured. The most interesting among its many portraits are those of Sir Elijah Impey, by Zoffany; of Sir Henry Russell and Sir Francis W. Macnaughten, both by Chinnery; and of Sir William Burroughs, by Sir Thomas Lawrence.\n\nThe Town Hall also stands west of Government House, between it and the High Court. It is a large building in the Doric style, approached by a noble flight of steps leading up the grand portico. It was built in 1804 by the citizens of Calcutta at a cost of about Rs. 700,000. Among many interesting pieces of art, it contains a marble statue of Warren Hastings, by R. Westmacott, another of the Marquis of Cornwallis, and a more recent one of Ram\u00e1nath Tagore, a well-known leader and reformer of native society in Calcutta. Among other buildings of note are the Bank of Bengal, facing the H\u00fagli, and the Mint, also on the river. The Currency Office, the Central Telegraph Office, the General Post-Office, a huge, heavy building, and the new Secretariat of the Government of Bengal, line the four sides of the historical Tank (now Dalhousie) Square.\n\nChurches.\u2014The principal churches number about 30, including Protestant ones of many denominations, Roman Catholic, Greek, P\u00e1rsi, and Hebrew. The Brahma Sam\u00e1j, or new Theistic sect of Bengal, founded by R\u00e1ja Rammohun Roy, have three places of worship. The Hindu temples are numerous, but feeble in design; while of the Muhammadan mosques, the only one of architectural pretensions is the Masjid at the corner of Dharmt\u00e1la Street. It was built and endowed in 1842, says the inscription, by the 'Prince Ghul\u00e1m Muhammad, son of the late Tip\u00fa Sult\u00e1n, in gratitude to God, and in commemoration of the Honourable Court of Directors granting him the arrears of his stipend in 1840.'\n\nThe Cathedral Church of the diocese of Calcutta, St. Paul's, at the southern corner of the maid\u00e1n or open plain, was commenced in 1839, and consecrated in 1847. An earlier project, started in 1819, fell through from want of funds. St. Paul's Cathedral is practically the work of the late Bishop Wilson. Of \u00a375,000 raised for its building and\nendowment, the Bishop gave \u00a320,000, and the East India Company \u00a315,000; while the whole subscription raised in India amounted to only \u00a312,000. The remaining \u00a328,000 were subscribed in England. About \u00a350,000 were spent on the building, which is of a style known in Calcutta as Indo-Gothic; that is to say, Gothic adapted by a military engineer to the exigencies of the Indian climate. The trees, which have grown up around it, now help to remedy the deficiencies of the architecture; and the spire rises picturesquely from the evergreen foliage at the extremity of the maid\u00e1n farthest from the town of Calcutta. The Cathedral is built in the form of a cross, 247 feet in length, with the transept 114 feet, and the tower and spire 201 feet in height. The most remarkable monument is a life-sized kneeling figure in bishop's robes, by Chantrey, bearing the single word 'Heber.'\n\nSt. John's Church, or the old Cathedral, was commenced in 1784. It was erected to replace a still older Church, built in 1715, the steeple of which fell down in the earthquake of 1737, while the whole Church was demolished by the Muhammadans during their occupation of Calcutta after its capture in 1756. The first meeting of the committee for building the present St. John's was attended by the Governor-General, Warren Hastings, and his Council. The structure cost about \u00a320,000, chiefly raised by voluntary subscription; a native R\u00e1j\u00e1 presenting the old burying-ground, in the midst of which the church stands, together with two acres of land adjoining, then valued at \u00a33000. The only work of art of importance is the old altar-piece, The Last Supper, painted and presented by Zoff\u00e1ny, and now removed to the west entrance. The graveyard around contains, however, several tombs of great historical interest. First in importance is that to Jobus Charnock, the founder of Calcutta in 1686, 'qui postquam in solo non suo peregrinatus esset diu reversus est domum su\u00e6 eternitatis decimo die Januarii 1692.' The mausoleum which covers Job Charnock is the oldest piece of masonry in Calcutta. Slabs commemorating the noble surgeon William Hamilton, who died 1717, and Admiral Watson, are built into its walls.\n\nThe Old Mission Church has a peculiar interest as having been erected, 1767-1770, by Kiernander, the first Protestant missionary to Bengal, and at his own expense. In 1786, the good Swede found himself unable to defray the charges involved by his benevolent schemes, and the church was seized by the Sheriff. It was rescued and restored to religious purposes by Charles Grant, afterwards the well-known East Indian Director, who paid Rs. 10,000, the sum at which it was appraised. Kiernander came to Cuddalore, in Madras, as a Swedish missionary in 1740. Stripped of his property, and driven from the place on its capture by Count Lally, he took refuge at Tranquebar in 1758, and in the following year he arrived in Calcutta.\nAfter more than a quarter of a century's usefulness as a missionary in that city, his pecuniary circumstances compelled him to become Chaplain to the Dutch Settlement at Chinsura about 1787\u201388. He returned to Calcutta in 1795, and there died in 1799, at the age of 88. His humble 'Beth-Tephillah,' or House of Prayer, has now, under the name of the Old Mission Church, one of the largest congregations in Calcutta.\n\nSt. Andrew's Church, known as the Scotch Kirk, is a handsome Grecian building. It was commenced on St. Andrew's Day, 1815. Lord Moira, the Governor-General, with his lady, the Countess of Loudoun and Moira, attended in State, together with an imposing array of Masonic, military, and civic dignitaries. A feud, which for a time shook Calcutta to its centre, arose in regard to the spire. 'Bishop Middleton, the first Bishop of Calcutta, believed that the Church of England had a monopoly of spires.' Dr. Bryce, the Scotch pastor of the newly-founded St. Andrew's Kirk, determined to vindicate the claims of his Church and his nation to these ecclesiastical ornaments, by carrying his steeple some feet higher up than that of St. John, then the Cathedral Church, and by placing a cock on the top of it in order to crow over the Bishop.\n\nThe Roman Catholics have 8 churches, the most important of which are the Cathedral, the Church of the Sacred Heart, and St. Thomas'. The last-named is in connection with the Loretto Convent, which stands on the site of Sir Elijah Impey's famous house, between Middleton Street and Middleton Row.\n\nThe H\u00fag\u043b\u0438 Bridge.\u2014Calcutta, as described in the foregoing paragraphs, lies on the east or left bank of the river. It is, however, connected with the important railway suburb on the other side of the H\u00fag\u043b\u0438 by a floating bridge. This structure, supported on enormous pontoons, is 1530 feet in length between the abutments, and has a massively-constructed roadway for carriages, 48 feet in width, with footpaths of 7 feet on either side. It was commenced in 1873, and opened for traffic in 1874, notwithstanding a serious collision with a large steamship, which the bore or tidal wave of the H\u00fag\u043b\u0438 had wrenched from her moorings, and dashed against the unfinished bridge. It has cost \u00a3220,000, and a toll is levied on all traffic between Calcutta and Howrah, except in the case of passengers and goods proceeding to or from the East India Railway terminus on the Howrah side.\n\nPopulation.\u2014Calcutta may in one sense be said to extend across the H\u00fag\u043b\u0438, and to include Howrah on the western side of the river, as well as the suburban municipality on the east. The total population of the area thus defined was returned in 1881 at 789,864. But Calcutta proper, or the central portion, known as the Municipality or 'Town of Calcutta,' and lying, roughly speaking, between the old Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 Ditch and the H\u00fag\u043b\u0438, is governed by a distinct municipal body.\nIn 1710, the population was reckoned at from 10,000 to 12,000. In 1752, Mr. Holwell estimated the number of houses within its limits at 51,132, and the inhabitants at 409,056 persons; but both these estimates must have been far too high. In 1822, the number of inhabitants was returned at 179,917, or according to another calculation, 230,552; in 1831, at 187,081; in 1850, at 361,369; and in 1866 at 377,924. In 1872, the first regular Census taken under the supervision of the municipality returned the population of the town at 447,601; but as the results presented features of doubtful accuracy, another Census was taken in 1876, which gave the population of the town, excluding the suburbs, at 429,535. The latest enumeration, in 1881, returned the population of Calcutta, including Fort William and the Port of Calcutta, at 433,219, and the suburbs at 251,439, making a total of 684,658, exclusive of Howrah, or 789,864 with Howrah.\n\nThe Census of 1881 was taken simultaneously on the night of the 17th February by four distinct agencies. That of Calcutta proper, namely, the area included in the metropolitan municipality, was conducted by the municipality; that of Fort William, by the military authority; the enumeration of the floating and river population was under the immediate supervision of the Superintendent of the Port Police; while the operations in the suburbs were carried out under the superintendence of the Vice-Chairman of the Suburban Municipality. The total area of the town, including the Fort and Esplanade, but excluding the river, is 5037 acres, while that of the suburbs is computed at 14,413 acres, or nearly three times as large. The following table exhibits the population of the town and suburbs of Calcutta, within the above limits, on the night of the 17th February 1881:\n\n| Area, Population, etc., of the Town and Suburbs of Calcutta, February 1881 (exclusive of Howrah). |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| **Area in acres.** | **Number of occupied houses.** | **Population.** | **Number of persons per acre.** | **Number of houses per acre.** | **Number of persons per occupied house.** |\n| Town of Calcutta, | 3,754 | 34,534 | 401,671 | 257,778 | 143,893 | 166'99 | 10'33 | 11'59 |\n| Fort William | 1,283* | ... | 3,348 | 3,002 | 346 | ... | ... | ... |\n| Port of Calcutta, | ... | ... | 28,200 | 28,037 | 163 | ... | ... | ... |\n| Total, | 5,037 | 34,534 | 433,219 | 288,817 | 144,402 | 106'99 | 10'33 | 11'59 |\n| Suburbs, | 14,413 | 37,805 | 251,439 | 147,205 | 104,234 | 17'45 | 2'83 | 6'56 |\n| Grand Total, | 19,450 | 72,339 | 684,658 | 436,022 | 248,636 | 35'20 | 3'74 | 0'46 |\n\n* Including the area of the Esplanade outside the Fort, the population of which, including the maidan (153) and the Presidency Jail (1182), have been returned as within the town proper.\nComparison with last Census.\u2014Apart from the Fort and the Port, the population within the strictly municipal area of Calcutta, which was 409,036 in 1876, was returned at 401,671 in 1881, showing a decrease of 1.8 per cent.; the falling off varying in the different wards from 2.2 to nearly 21 per cent. Five wards show an increase varying from 3.9 to 13.9 per cent. Total decrease in certain wards, 13,553; total increase in others, 6,188; net decrease, 7,365. The variations in most instances are satisfactorily accounted for by the outward movements of the population in consequence of municipal or other improvements. As a rule, the tendency has been for the population to move back from the river bank, and from the centre of the town to the outskirts beyond the strictly municipal area. In the wards along the river bank, the improvement of the Strand Bank, and the removal of private residences or their conversion into warehouses for the storage of jute and other produce, account for a considerable decrease in the number of inhabitants. In some of the more central wards, too, there have been considerable municipal improvements, which have opened out the most crowded thoroughfares by new roads and clearances, and have had the effect of driving the people farther east into neighbouring wards. A slight increase in the Fort population is attributable partly to the fact that at the Census of 1881, a detachment of Native Cavalry was temporarily encamped here, and partly to the fact that in February 1881 several military headquarter offices were in the Fort, which in April 1876 were in the hills.\n\nThe port of Calcutta, including vessels proceeding up and down the river, which in 1872 contained a population of 17,696, had in 1881 a population of 28,200, showing an increase of 10,504 souls, or 59 per cent. The sea-going population numbered 6,153, on board 192 vessels, either in port or proceeding up or down the river. The number of boats censused was 4,220, with a population of 22,047 souls. Deducting vessels or boats censused before or after the date of the enumeration, the actual population of the port on the night of the 17th February 1881 was 21,342 souls, as compared with 17,696 on the night of the 6th April 1876. The increase in the shipping is partly explained by the difference in the time of the year at which the Census was taken; and an increase in the shipping naturally explains an increase in the number of boats. The port Census in 1881 also included a portion of the river north of the actual port limits, which was not included on the last occasion. Taking the population of the whole of Calcutta and the suburbs, the result shows a nominal decrease of 0.29 per cent. in 1881, as compared with the previous enumeration. The population within Calcutta may therefore be considered as stationary; but it must be remembered that the people tend to move outwards to the environs.\nAs regards accuracy, the Census officers report that there is no reason to doubt the correctness of the enumeration.\n\n**Religious and Caste Classification.**\u2014Of the total population of the town, port, and suburbs, 428,692, or 62 per cent., are Hindus; 221,013, or 32\u00b72 per cent., are Muhammadans; 30,478, or 4\u00b74 per cent., are Christians; 488 are Brahmos; 1705 Buddhists; 143 Jains; 986 Jews; 142 Parsis; 284 Sikhs; while 727 belong to other (chiefly aboriginal) religions. Among the Hindus, Brahmans number 52,241, and Kayasths 52,331; these two castes numbering about one-fourth of the total Hindu population. Next to them come Kaibarttas, 34,262; Chamars, skinners and leather workers, 21,501; Subarnabaniyas, goldsmiths and jewellers, 17,535; Tantis, weavers, 16,458; Vaishnavs, 15,765; Bagdis, 13,433; Gwalas, 12,274; Sadgops, 11,543; Kahars, 11,041; Telis, 10,769; and Mehtars, 10,636. Of the 221,013 Muhammadans, no fewer than 213,334 are returned as of the Sunni sect. Among the Christian population, out of a total of 17,226 Protestants, 8768 returned themselves as members of the Church of England, 1869 as members of the Church of Scotland, 857 as Baptists, 692 as Methodists, 230 as Independents or Congregationalists, and 329 as Lutherans. Other Dissenters number 116. No less than 4365 persons returned themselves simply as Protestant, without further specification of sect, the majority of whom belong no doubt to the Church of England. Roman Catholics numbered 11,095; Armenians, 649; Greeks, 133; while 1297 persons have simply entered themselves as Christians, without any specification of sect. Unitarians and Theists were returned at 29; and Agnostics and \u2018others\u2019 at 49 in number. The Native Christian community numbered, in 1881, 4101, distributed among the following sects:\u2014Roman Catholics, 1358; Church of England, 724; Scotch Church, 242; Baptists, 351; Methodists, 92; Congregationalists, 131; Plymouth Brethren, 8; other Protestants, 589; and sect not specified, 606.\n\n**The Governing Body,** or Municipality of Calcutta, was created by Act vi. of 1863 (Bengal Council), and has been remodelled by subsequent legislation, on a basis of popular election. It consists of a body of Justices of the Peace or Commissioners, a certain number of whom are elected by the ratepayers, while the remainder are nominated by the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal. The native element is largely represented in this body. A salaried chairman, selected by the Lieutenant-Governor from the Covenanted Civil Service, directs the whole, aided by a deputy chairman and other subordinates appointed by the Justices themselves. The Justices or Commissioners receive no pay. In 1882, the ordinary revenue of the municipality amounted to \u00a3270,712, of which the principal items were as follows:\u2014House-rate, \u00a396,569; taxes, \u00a345,018; water-rates and sale of water, \u00a349,549;\nlighting rate, \u00a324,586. The ordinary expenditure in the same year amounted to \u00a3226,560, of which \u00a3167,157 was debitable to the general fund, \u00a337,025 to the water-rate fund, and \u00a322,377 to the lighting of the town. Including capital account receipts, loans, suspense account, and cash balances, the total amount at the disposal of the Justices during the year was \u00a3599,119. The aggregate expenditure under both revenue and capital account amounted to \u00a3484,997. The total loan liabilities of the corporation on the 31st March 1883 amounted to \u00a31,521,453, or deducting \u00a3233,114, the nominal value of the sinking fund on that date, to \u00a31,288,338. The total length of roads in Calcutta at the end of 1882 was 160 miles, comprising 72\u00bd miles of stone metalled roads, 64 miles of brick metalled roads, and 23\u00bd miles of minor roads over sewered ditches. Expenditure on road repairs and construction in 1882, \u00a325,232. A Tramway Company, subject to certain municipal rules and bye-laws, maintained at the end of 1882 a service along the principal roads and streets for a length exceeding 17 miles. The tramway has proved a great convenience to the public, and its lines of rail are being extended.\n\nThe Water-Supply forms the most important undertaking under the care of the municipality. The present system dates from 1865, when the sanction of Government was given to the construction of works which now pour upwards of eight million gallons a day of filtered water into the city. The source of supply is from the H\u00fagli at P\u00e1lt\u00e1, about 16 miles above Calcutta. The works there consist of two large suction pipes, 30 inches in diameter, through which the water is drawn from the river by three engines, each of 50 horse-power nominal. The water is then passed into six settling tanks, each 500 feet long by 250 feet wide. Here it is allowed to stand for 36 hours, when it is permitted to run off to the filters, eight in number, the area of each being 200 by 100 feet. After filtration, the water is made to flow over a marble platform, where its purity can be observed. It is then conducted to Calcutta by a 42-inch iron main. The main works were finished in 1870, and connected with pipes laid under 100 miles of streets. The total number of house connections up to December 31, 1874, was 8159; by 1882 they had increased to 14,245, with a constantly augmenting demand. The total quantity of filtered water delivered during 1874 amounted to 2,524,566 gallons. By 1882, the supply, owing to the increased demand, had risen to 2,855,970,421 gallons, or an average daily supply of 7,824,576 gallons, equal to eighteen gallons per head of the 'town,' port, and fort population. The demand is of course greatest in the hot weather; and in the quarter May\u2013July 1883, an average daily quantity of 8,279,167 gallons, or nineteen gallons per head, was delivered in the city. Owing to the increasing wants of the town for filtered water for purely domestic purposes, it has been found\nnecessary to increase greatly the supply of unfiltered water for the watering of streets, flushing of sewers, building operations, etc., for which filtered water was formerly used. In 1883, a daily average of three million gallons of unfiltered water was pumped direct from the H\u00fagl\u00ed for these purposes. Still more powerful engines commenced work in 1884, just below the pontoon bridge. The total cost of filtered water supplied to the town amounted in 1882 to a fraction less than 4d. per thousand gallons, and of unfiltered water to 1d. per thousand gallons.\n\nThe Drainage Works are on an equally extensive scale. The main sewers are underground; and for the proper discharge of their contents in the direction of the Salt Lake, a pumping station is maintained at an annual cost of \u00a33000. The system of underground drainage now (1883) virtually completed comprises 36\u00b777 miles of main brick sewers, and 113\u00b714 miles of pipe sewers; total length, 149\u00b791 miles. In 1863, on the constitution of the present municipality, a health officer with a subordinate establishment was appointed. The practice of throwing corpses into the river has been stopped; and the burning gh\u00e1ts and burial-grounds have been placed under supervision. All refuse and night-soil are removed by the municipality by a special railway to the Salt Lake.\n\nThe city is lighted by a private gas company, under contract with the municipality, 4621 gas lamps and 140 oil lamps being paid for at the public expense (1882). The fire brigade consisted of two steam fire-engines and five hand-engines. Its annual cost is about \u00a32000.\n\nThe Police of Calcutta is under the control of the Commissioner, who is also the Chairman of the Justices. Beneath him there is a Deputy Commissioner. The force consisted in 1882 of 4 superintendents, 219 subordinate officers of various grades, 1227 constables, and 6 mounted constables, maintained at a yearly cost of \u00a342,389, of which Government contributed one-fourth. Several minor bodies, such as the river police, Fort police, preventive police, Government guards, etc., raise the entire strength of the force in the town and on the river to 2297 men. The great majority are natives, the number of European and Eurasian sergeants and constables being only 81. The Suburban police consisted in the same year of 2 superintendents, 60 subordinate officers of various grades, 654 constables, and 8 detective officers, maintained at a cost of \u00a315,374, the cost being about equally divided between the municipality and the Government.\n\nThe Jails in Calcutta and the suburbs are the Presidency jail, with a total daily average prison population in 1881\u201382 of 75\u00b714 Europeans and 1146\u00b799 natives; the Alipur jail, with a daily average prison population of 1999\u00b714; and the Rassa jail for females, with a daily average prison population of 175\u00b715. The Alipur and Rassa jails are central prisons, and receive long-term convicts from other Districts.\nThe Statistics of Education in Calcutta in 1883 were as follows:\u2014There were 4 Government colleges, namely, the Presidency College, founded in 1855, and attended by 383 pupils in the General Department and 11 in the Law Department; the Sanskrit College, established in 1824, attended by 57 pupils in the Upper and 195 in the Lower Division; the Calcutta Madr\u00e1s\u00e1 or Muhammadan College, founded in 1781, number of pupils 442; the Bethune Girls' School, with 4 pupils in the College Department. This last-named institution has passed two pupils at the examination of the Calcutta University for the degree of B.A. There were also 5 colleges mainly supported by missionary efforts, but aided by Government, which were attended by 951 pupils. The number of unaided colleges was 4, three of them under native management. These had an aggregate number of 653 pupils in the General and 404 in the Law Department. There were also the College of Engineering at Howrah, attended by 166 pupils; the Calcutta Medical College, with 126 pupils; the Government School of Art, with 96 pupils; and the Campbell Vernacular Medical School, with 140 pupils. The total number of schools in Calcutta reported on in 1883 by the Education Department was 291, with 25,124 scholars; 149 of them were for males, teaching 20,008 boys; the remaining 142 are for girls and Zenana ladies, teaching 5116 pupils. According to a different principle of classification, 82 schools taught English to 14,055 boys; 75 taught the vernacular only to 3521 boys; 119 were vernacular schools for girls, with 2848 pupils; and 3 were normal schools, instructing 68 male and 46 female teachers. Of the total number of pupils in these schools, 73.5 per cent. were returned as Hindus, 17.3 Christians, 7.5 Musalm\u00e1ns, while the remaining 17 per cent. were of other persuasions. The total ascertained expenditure on colleges and special institutions was \u00a358,746, and on schools of all classes \u00a385,698, being a total of \u00a3144,444, of which the Government contributed \u00a361,097.\n\nThe Medical Charities of Calcutta comprise the Medical College Hospital, the General Hospital, the Mayo Hospital (for natives only), the Campbell Hospital, the Municipal Police Hospital, the Howrah Hospital on the opposite side of the river, and minor dispensaries. In July 1882, the Eden Hospital for women and children was opened, to meet a want long felt in Calcutta. The General Hospital is confined almost solely to Europeans. The total amount contributed by Government to these institutions in 1882 was \u00a323,224, or just under 63 per cent. of their total expenditure. The total number of persons treated in these institutions in 1882 was 20,579 in-door and 232,504 out-door patients, the proportion of deaths to patients treated being 143.73 per thousand. Cholera deaths in hospital in 1882 numbered 468 out of a total of 859 treated, or an average mortality of 54.2 per cent. The\ngeneral hospital mortality is largely attributable to numerous admissions of moribund and hopeless cases in the Campbell and Howrah Hospitals. In 1882, the total number of deaths registered in Calcutta proper amounted to 13,177, or 30.4 per thousand of the population, as against a mean registered mortality of 29.4 per thousand in the preceding ten years. This increase is mainly due to cholera, to which 2240 deaths were attributed in 1882, as compared with a mean of 1341 during the previous years. The mortality from other diseases in 1882 was\u2014diarrhoea and dysentery, 1454; fevers, 3618; small-pox, 17; other causes, 5848: total, 13,177.\n\nMortuary Returns are collected in Calcutta by the police inspectors, and compared with the registers kept by paid clerks of the municipality at the burning gh\u00e2ts and burial-grounds. The death-rate among the Europeans in 1882 was 15.5 per thousand, among the Eurasians 45.5; among the Hindus 32.6, and among the Muhammadans 27.1. The general death-rate of the population was 30.4 per thousand. The highest death-rate was in January, November, and December, and the lowest in July and August. The rains are the healthiest season in Calcutta, because the two main causes of mortality, fever and cholera, are at a minimum during those months. A system of birth registration is also in operation in Calcutta; but the returns, although slowly improving year by year, greatly understate the facts, and there is no doubt that a considerable number of births escape registration.\n\nThe Mean Temperature of Calcutta is about 79\u00b0 F. The highest temperature recorded during the last 24 years is 106\u00b0 in the shade, and the lowest 52.7\u00b0. The extreme range is therefore a little over 53\u00b0, while the mean temperatures of December and May, the coldest and hottest months, are 68.0\u00b0 and 86.1\u00b0 respectively. The average temperature in 1882 was a fraction below the mean, ranging from a minimum mean of 67.7\u00b0 in January to a maximum of 83.8\u00b0 in June. The average rainfall during 48 years has been 66.38 inches,\u2014the highest rainfall on record being 93.31 inches in 1871, and the lowest 43.61 inches in 1837. The rainfall in 1882 was just equal to the average, 66.18 inches. By far the greater part of the rain falls between the months of June and October.\n\nCyclones.\u2014Like the rest of the seaboard of the Bay of Bengal, Calcutta is exposed to periodical cyclones, which do much mischief. Terrible storms are recorded as having swept across Calcutta in the last century, throwing down houses and flooding the city. The tempest of which perhaps the best scientific observations exist is that of 1864. The greatest pressure of the wind registered has been 50 lbs. to the square foot. In the storms of 1864 and 1867, the anemometer was blown away. A great loss of life and property was caused along the H\u00fbgli by the storm of October 5, 1864. In Calcutta and its suburbs, 49 persons\nwere killed and 16 wounded, 102 brick houses were destroyed and 563 severely damaged; 40,698 tiled and straw huts were levelled with the ground. The destruction of shipping in the port of Calcutta appears greatly to have exceeded that on record in any previous storm. Out of 195 vessels only 23 remained uninjured, and 31, with an aggregate tonnage of 27,653 tons, were totally wrecked. On November 2, 1867, the force of the wind was not less violent, but there was no storm wave, and consequently the amount of damage done was much less.\n\nThe Port of Calcutta, extending 10 miles along the H\u00fagl\u00ed, with an average width of working channel of 250 yards, and with moorings for 169 vessels, is under the management of a body of 9 European gentlemen styled 'Commissioners for making Improvements in the Port of Calcutta.' This body was constituted in 1870, and has since that date received considerable additions to its powers. In 1871, they were also appointed 'Bridge Commissioners,' to take charge of the floating bridge then being constructed over the H\u00fagl\u00ed, and to work it when completed. This bridge, finished in 1874, now supplies a permanent connection between Calcutta and the railway terminus on the Howrah side of the river. As already stated, it is constructed on pontoons, and affords a roadway for foot travellers and vehicles. A section of it is opened at fixed hours, on certain days of the week, so as to allow vessels to pass up the H\u00fagl\u00ed beyond it. The main duty of the Port Commissioners consists in providing accommodation, by jetties and warehouses, for the shipping and native boats, which carry on the great and increasing trade of Calcutta. In October 1881, the Port Commissioners were invested with further powers and responsibilities as conservators of the port approaches, and with the control of the port establishment, lighthouses, lightships, and harbour vessels.\n\nThese new powers extend the supervision of the Port Commissioners down the whole length of the H\u00fagl\u00ed to the sea. The condition of the H\u00fagl\u00ed channels has attracted their serious attention, and a project has been revived for supplementing the H\u00fagl\u00ed approach to Calcutta by another water-way from the south-east. In 1864-66, it was proposed to make Port Canning, on the Matl\u00e1 river, a subsidiary port to Calcutta; and a railway of 28 miles was constructed to connect the two points. This scheme failed, however, to attain any commercial success (see Port Canning). The growing commerce of Calcutta, and the necessity of providing for the safe storage of the great imports of kerosine and mineral oils beyond the limits of the port, have led to the reconsideration of the Matl\u00e1 project. It is now proposed that a ship canal should take off from that river and debouch on the H\u00fagl\u00ed near the Kidderpur dockyard, within the limits of the Port of Calcutta. An alternative water-way would thus be supplied for the\ncommerce of the capital. Calcutta would no longer be dependent upon the shifting channels of the H\u00fagl\u00ed; and Port Canning would afford a place of storage for the mineral oils whose increasing importation has become a source of danger to the crowded shipping in the Calcutta Port, notwithstanding the precautions adopted to land that explosive material below its limits. The expense of the scheme will be great; and its consideration by Government has not yet arrived at a stage when it would be safe to predict the issue. A decision will probably be come to before I reach the articles Matla River and Port Canning (q.v.).\n\nShipping and Tonnage of Calcutta.\u2014In 1727, the whole shipping of the port was estimated at 10,000 tons. In 1759, 30 vessels sailed from Calcutta, aggregating 3964 tons burthen. During the 11 months ending April 1812, the total trade, both export and import, amounted to 9\u00bd millions sterling, carried on by 600 vessels aggregating 150,000 tons. The number of vessels arriving and departing in 1861\u201362 was 1793, with an aggregate tonnage of 1,337,632 tons; in 1873\u201374, the number of vessels was 1927, tonnage 2,437,447; while in 1881\u201382, an aggregate of 2132 vessels arrived and departed, with a total tonnage of 3,582,989 tons. The number of steamers, especially of steamers passing through the Suez Canal, is greatly on the increase; in 1881\u201382, the arrivals of steamers at Calcutta numbered 239.\n\nForeign Sea-borne Commerce.\u2014The growth of the trade of Calcutta is shown by the following figures:\u2014In 1820\u201321, the total value of foreign exports and imports, including treasure, was \u00a310,454,910; in 1830\u201331, \u00a38,756,382; in 1840\u201341, \u00a315,202,697; in 1850\u201351, \u00a318,754,025; in 1860\u201361, \u00a331,794,671; in 1870\u201371, \u00a349,316,738; in 1874\u201375, \u00a354,288,555; and in 1881\u201382, over 55\u00be millions. The value of the customs duties (including salt) was in 1820\u201321, \u00a3151,817; in 1830\u201331, \u00a3121,321; in 1840\u201341, \u00a3495,515; in 1850\u201351, \u00a31,038,365; in 1860\u201361, \u00a32,270,654; in 1870\u201371, \u00a33,548,926. The practical abolition of the customs tariff renders a comparison of 1881 and 1871 of no value. About 95\u00bd per cent. of the foreign import trade of Bengal, and 97\u00b78 per cent. of the foreign export trade, are carried on through Calcutta. A decline to the extent of nearly \u00a32,000,000 took place in the imports of 1881\u201382, as compared with those of the previous year, owing to the reduced receipts of cotton goods. This was mainly due to excessive importations in 1880\u201381, and not to any falling off in the general standard of comfort, the maintenance of which is indicated by the fact that the imports of gold were higher by \u00a340,000 in 1881\u201382 than in 1880\u201381. The export foreign trade during 1881\u201382 amounted to \u00a333,526,111, showing an advance of \u00a3557,694, or 1\u00b76 per cent., over the previous year. An increase of \u00a3837,241 took place in the exports of Indian free merchandise, and a decrease of \u00a3251,980 in rice, although the quantity\nexported was greater by 21,000 tons than in the preceding year. Had the prices of 1880-81 been maintained, the total exports of all kinds from Calcutta would have been higher by nearly \u00a31,000,000 than in that year.\n\nThe fluctuations in the foreign trade of Calcutta during 1881-82 may be thus summarised. In the trade with the United Kingdom a falling off of 178 per cent. took place, owing mainly to the decline in the importation of piece-goods. In metals there was a decline of about \u00a3185,000; and candles, precious stones, umbrellas, and woollen goods all fell off to some extent. Among the exports to Great Britain, jute, tea, and wheat showed an increase; while linseed, raw cotton, rice, and indigo declined. One-half of the falling off in the trade with Hong-Kong, which amounted to nearly \u00a3600,000, was partly balanced by an increase of \u00a3300,000 in the trade with the Treaty Ports. Larger importations of Californian silver from Hong-Kong account for the greater part of the increased imports from that port. Imports from the United States, which fell off by about \u00a380,000 in 1880-81, improved during the year by about \u00a370,000, due almost entirely to large arrivals of kerosine oil. A further decline of about \u00a350,000 took place in the exports to America, which in 1880-81 were nearly \u00a3600,000 behind those of the previous year, owing in great part to the substitution of machine-made ice for the imported commodity. The exports of indigo were low in 1880-81, owing possibly to the fear of the production of artificial indigo, which checked the operations of speculators; and the possibility of the ultimate substitution of artificial dye for the natural product is a contingency which it behoves planters to carefully bear in mind. The trade with the Straits Settlements amounted to \u00a32,171,841, being larger by \u00a339,178 than in the previous year, almost the whole of the increase being due to the exports of opium, gunny-bags, and rice. A slight fall of \u00a325,000 occurred in the trade with France, which, however, was still higher than in 1879-80 by \u00a3430,000. The decline was mainly due to the large imports of silk goods in 1880-81, which had to some extent overstocked the market. Exports of manufactured Indian silks to France increased, and there were large increases in the exports of wheat and jute. A satisfactory advance occurred in the trade with Australia. The advance in the exports of tea, which amounted to \u00a357,000, may be regarded as an indication of a further development of the taste for Indian tea in Australia, which, with care on the part of the growers, will probably result in the establishment in those colonies of a large permanent market for the consumption of one of the most important products of British India. The trade of Calcutta passing through the Suez Canal, though showing some falling off in 1881-82 as compared with 1880-81, was yet larger than in any year previous to 1880. The value of both imports and exports carried by this route\nin 1881-82 was \u00a332,489,491, and there was an increase of one per cent. in the proportion of foreign trade using the canal. The following paragraphs show the extent and value of the different staples of Calcutta foreign trade.\n\n**Imports.**\u2014Imports of cotton twist and yarn in 1881-82 amounted to 14,221,951 lbs., valued at \u00a31,164,585, a considerable decline on 1880-81, which was mainly due, as stated above, to excessive importations in the latter year. Cotton goods first became an important article of import in 1824. Metals were imported in 1881-82 to the value of \u00a31,734,191, showing a decline on the imports of 1880-81, chiefly in the case of copper and zinc. Malt liquor was imported in 1881-82 to the extent of 540,818 gallons, valued at \u00a3131,902. Imports of spirits declined from \u00a3257,851 in 1880-81 to \u00a3246,445 in 1882. The importation of all kinds of wines and liqueurs has fallen of late years. The total import of liquors of all kinds in 1877-78 was \u00a3672,049, of which 23\u00b72 per cent. was malt liquor, 44\u00b79 per cent. spirits, and 31\u00b77 per cent. wines and liqueurs. In 1881-82 the amount had decreased to \u00a3549,122, of which malt liquors contributed 24 per cent., spirits 44\u00b78 per cent., and wines 31 per cent. A great increase has taken place in recent years in the importation of machinery into India, mainly due to the extension of manufacturing industry. The value of imported railway material rose from \u00a3187,497 in 1880-81, to \u00a3303,790 in 1881-82, the advance being entirely under the head of materials for construction, mainly for the Central Bengal Railway, the Assam Railway, and the Tirhut State Railway. That mineral oils are rapidly taking the place of vegetable oils for lighting purposes, is evident from the fact that, while 1,242,708 gallons, valued at \u00a3102,468, were imported in 1877-78, no less than 5,776,610 gallons, valued at \u00a3275,133, were imported in 1881-82. American petroleum has almost entirely driven the produce of other countries out of the market. Drugs showed an increase, owing to a rise in arrivals of quinine; total value of drug imports in 1881-82, \u00a3181,652. Silk imports showed a considerable falling off, owing to overstocking in previous years, the imports in 1881-82 being only 56,082 lbs., as against 168,417 lbs. in 1880-81. The import of coral also declined, owing, it is said, to overstocking of the market by the Sicilian coral fishermen, whose poverty prevented them from holding back for a rise in prices. Umbrellas form an important article of import, the number received being 1,345,848 in 1881-82. Tea imports from Hong-Kong amounted to 161,728 lbs., from the Straits Settlements to 422,894 lbs., and from other places 6613 lbs., total 591,235 lbs., against 343,459 lbs. in 1880-81, and 542,433 lbs. in 1879-80.\n\n**Exports.**\u2014The jute trade made a considerable advance,\u2014from 5,367,855 cwts. in 1880-81 to 6,896,610 cwts. in 1881-82,\u2014increased\nquantities having been taken by all the countries with which the trade is carried on, except Austria. The export to the United Kingdom, which expanded by nearly one million cwts., is believed, however, to have overstocked the market. A large local demand slightly kept down the export of gunny-bags, the value of which in consequence fell from \u00a31,065,526 in 1880-81 to \u00a31,063,666. The principal falling off occurred in the exports to the United States and England, while some increase took place in the exports to China, the Straits Settlements, and Australia. Although the value of rice exported in 1881-82 was lower than in 1880-81, the decline was solely due to a falling in price arising from an abundant harvest; the amount actually shipped having been 6,350,092 cwts. in 1881-82, against 5,948,208 cwts. in the preceding year. The quantity and value of wheat exported rose from 3,955,269 cwts., valued at \u00a31,512,695, in 1880-81, to 6,666,896 cwts., valued at \u00a32,520,329, in 1881-82. Except Malta, all countries importing wheat from India took a larger quantity than the previous year, the causes assigned being a deficient harvest and speculation in the United States.\n\nThe exports of tea during 1881-82 increased by over two millions of pounds, or 4\u00bd per cent. over the exports in 1881-82, while there was an advance of \u00a3530,000, or 17\u00be per cent., in the total value, in consequence of a rise in prices. The total exports amounted to \u00a33,528,863 in 1881-82. The finer grades of tea are reported to have been produced in a greater proportion than usual, and it is evident that the taste for Indian tea of a good quality is becoming firmly established in England. Lower qualities of tea also sold at improved prices. Tea exports to Australia increased from 776,852 lbs. in 1880-81 to 871,913 lbs. in 1881-82, or by 12\u00bd per cent.; 195,686 lbs. were exported to the United States. Exports of indigo showed an increase over the two previous years. With the exception of rape-seed, of which 974,570 cwts. were shipped in 1881-82, against 824,509 cwts. in 1880-81, all exports of oil-seeds showed a decline during the year, the falling off being most marked in the case of linseed, of which the shipments amounted to 2,864,116 cwts., against 4,065,341 cwts. in 1880-81. The large yield of the American cotton crop resulted in a falling off of the exports of raw cotton from Bengal from 875,697 cwts. in 1880-81 to 702,336 cwts. in 1881-82. With the exception of Austria and Italy, the demand of all countries importing Bengal cotton has declined. A considerable decrease in the number of undressed hides and skins exported took place during the year, owing probably to a diminished supply rather than to a falling off in the demand. Dressed skins and hides showed an increase, but the total exports were about 500,000 below those of 1880-81. Exports of lac of all kinds rose from 86,647 cwts., valued at \u00a3575,549, in 1880-81, to 116,205 cwts., valued at \u00a3716,101, in 1881-82. Shell-lac formed nearly three-fourths of the total exports, and button-lac\nthe greater part of the remainder. Exports of raw silk fell both in value and quantity, but shipments of silk piece-goods remained comparatively stationary. Bengal silk is not in a position to compete with the silks produced in Europe, China, or Japan. A slight increase, from 9460 cwts. to 16,133 cwts., in the export of sugar, when taken with the fact that imports from the Mauritius, the Straits Settlements, and Java fell from 42,904 cwts. to 4079 cwts., shows fairly conclusively that the Indian demand is now supplied almost entirely by local production, and there is no reason to doubt that an expansion of the industry would be met by an increased demand for Indian sugar abroad. A considerable falling off took place in the exports of tobacco, which declined from 7,853,118 lbs., valued at \u00a342,980, in 1880-81, to 4,782,384 lbs., valued at \u00a333,497.\n\nTreasure.\u2014The imports of gold in 1881-82 amounted to \u00a3999,349, and of silver to \u00a3922,789, against \u00a3890,024 of gold and \u00a3944,674 of silver in 1880-81; while silver amounting to \u00a3214,566 was exported in 1881-82, against \u00a3220,101 in 1880-81.\n\nCoasting Trade.\u2014The value of the Calcutta coasting trade in 1881-82 was as follows: Imports\u2014Indian produce, \u00a32,322,008; foreign merchandise, \u00a3186,064: total, \u00a32,508,072. Exports\u2014Indian produce, \u00a33,360,137; foreign merchandise, \u00a31,228,100: total, \u00a34,588,237. Grand total of coasting imports and exports in 1881-82, \u00a37,096,309, or \u00a334,047 less than in 1880-81. The falling off in the imports was confined to trade with Bombay, about \u00a340,000; British Burma, over \u00a3160,000; and ports outside British India, nearly \u00a330,000. The imports from Madras and from the Bengal out-ports rose during 1881-82 to about \u00a330,000 and \u00a335,000 respectively over 1880-81. Decreased importations of piece-goods, railway sleepers, cutch, and gambier, account for the falling off in the imports from Bombay and Burma. The increase in the trade with Madras and the Bengal out-ports was due to larger arrivals of timber and hides. The chief remaining fluctuations in the import trade were an increase of \u00a387,500 in raw cotton from Bombay and teak timber from Maulmain, and a decline of \u00a395,000 in castor-oil seed from Coconada and Masulipatam, and of \u00a340,000 in raw cotton from Madras. The low price of rice caused a decline in the value of the imports of that staple from the Orissa ports. Cotton twist and yarn of Indian manufacture imported into Calcutta, rose from \u00a3271,821 in 1880-81 to \u00a3282,655 in 1881-82; and Indian piece-goods fell from \u00a3211,047 to \u00a3126,603. The piece-goods imported coastwise consisted almost entirely of yarn of 32's and under, and the decline was due more to the absence of demand than to the competition of English manufactures with Indian goods of these coarse textures. Exports of Indian produce coastwise showed an increase in the case of Bombay, Sind, and British Burma, and of ports not situated in British\nIndia, but declined in the case of Madras and the Bengal out-ports, the net result being an increase of about \u00a3300,000. In foreign commodities, the most noticeable feature in the export coasting trade was the falling off in the exports of cotton piece-goods and twist to Madras and Burma, which is accounted for in the former case by the successful competition of European manufactures, and in the latter by the substitution of country-dyed for foreign twist.\n\nThe Customs duties on cotton piece-goods, as well as on most other imports, were finally abolished in 1882, only the duties on wines and spirits, arms and ammunition, and a few other articles being retained on the tariff. For practical purposes, Calcutta is now a free port.\n\nThe Landward Trade of Calcutta is conducted partly by railway, and partly by water. There is no railway station within the limits of the municipality, but three separate lines have their termini in its immediate neighbourhood. The East Indian Railway, whose terminus is across the river at Howrah, brings down the produce of the North-Western Provinces and Behar, and connects Calcutta with the general railway system of the Peninsula. The Eastern Bengal Railway and the South-Eastern Railway have their terminus at Si\u00e1ldah, an eastern suburb of Calcutta. The Eastern Bengal Railway is an important line running across the Delta to the junction of the Ganges and Brahmaputra at Go\u00e1land\u00e1, now continued towards D\u00e1rjiling by the Northern Bengal State line. The South-Eastern Railway is a short railway, connecting the metropolis with Port Canning, in the Sundarbans (28 miles). It has a branch to Diamond Harbour, on the H\u00fagli, 38 miles by rail, and about 41 miles by water from Calcutta. The three chief lines of water traffic are\u2014(1) the Calcutta canals, a chain of channels and rivers passing round and through the Sundarbans, open at all seasons of the year, and affording the main line of communication with the Ganges and the Brahmaputra; (2) the Nadiy\u00e1 rivers, three in number, which branch off in a southern course from the Ganges, above its junction with the Brahmaputra, and ultimately become the H\u00fagli\u2014these Nadiy\u00e1 rivers are with difficulty navigable during the dry season; (3) the Midnapur and Hijili canals, leading south towards Orissa. The import trade, which thus finds its way from the interior into Calcutta, exclusive of opium and railway materials, was valued at \u00a346,424,319 in 1881\u201382. Over 11 millions sterling were brought by country boats, nearly 3\u00bd millions by river steamers, 21\u00be millions by the East Indian Railway, 6 millions sterling by the Eastern Bengal Railway, nearly \u00a390,000 by the South-Eastern Railway, and over 3\u00be millions sterling by road. The export trade from Calcutta into the interior of the country was valued in 1881\u201382 at \u00a327,841,540. Of goods thus sent inland, 4\u00bd millions\nsterling went by country boats, \\(1\\frac{1}{4}\\) million by river steamers, nearly 16 millions by the East Indian Railway, \\(4\\frac{1}{2}\\) millions by the Eastern Bengal Railway, \\(\u00a315,000\\) by the South-Eastern Railway, and \\(1\\frac{3}{4}\\) million by road. Total value of inland import and export trade of Calcutta in 1881-82, \\(74\\frac{1}{4}\\) millions sterling.\n\nThe gross value of the landward, seaward, and coasting trade of Calcutta, imports and exports, amounted to 140 millions sterling in 1881-82. In this aggregate many transactions are included twice: but, on the other hand, large supplies are daily drawn from the surrounding Districts which cannot be registered, and which therefore do not enter into the above total.\n\n**Cali\u00e1n (Ch\u00e1l\u00edyam).**\u2014Site of an old town in Malab\u00e1r District, Madras Presidency, which arose out of a factory built by the first Portuguese settlers. The railway station of Beypur is at or near the spot where the factory stood.\n\n**Cali\u00e1n.**\u2014Town, Th\u00e1na District, Bombay Presidency.\u2014See KALYAN.\n\n**Calicut (Kolik\u00f3du).**\u2014T\u00e1luk in Malab\u00e1r District, Madras Presidency. Area, 339 square miles, containing 1 town and 38 villages. Houses, 34,751. Population (1881) 205,962, namely, 103,669 males and 102,293 females. Land revenue (1882-83) \\(\u00a313,957\\). The Subdivision contains 3 civil and 4 criminal courts. Chief town, Calicut.\n\n**Calicut (Kolik\u00f3du; Koli-kukkuga, 'Cock-crowing;' Kolikotta, 'Cockfort').**\u2014Town and port in the Calicut t\u00e1luk, Malab\u00e1r District, Madras Presidency; situated on the sea-coast 6 miles north of Beypur, in the midst of extensive palm-groves. Lat. \\(11\u00b0 15' N.\\), long. \\(75\u00b0 49' E.\\). Houses, 8540. Population (estimated at 20,000 in 1827) had risen by 1881 to 57,085, namely, 33,875 Hindus, 20,257 Muhammadans\u2014all Moplas (M\u00e1ppill\u00e1s), 2909 Christians, and 43 'others.' Of the adult male population, about 32 per cent. are Tiyars or toddy-drawers, 20 per cent. boat-builders and boatmen, and 14 per cent. Lubbay traders. The municipal income for 1880-81 was \\(\u00a34675\\), and the allotment for sanitary purposes, \\(\u00a3637\\); the incidence of municipal taxation, including tolls, being about 1s. \\(3\\frac{3}{4}\\)d. per head. Value of exports in 1880-81, including those of the sub-port of Beypur, \\(\u00a3664,220\\); imports, \\(\u00a3343,126\\). As the head-quarters of the rich and populous District of Malab\u00e1r, Calicut contains the chief revenue, magisterial, and judicial establishments of the District, with Government and marine offices, a customs house, jail, lunatic asylum, dispensary, hospitals, post and telegraph offices, travellers' bungalow, and bank. The Anglican, Lutheran, and Roman Catholic Churches have missions here, with schools; in addition to which there is the municipal school, and several others, assisted by grants.\n\nOwing to frequent Mopla outrages, a detachment of European infantry was stationed at Calicut in 1849. It was removed to the\noutpost at Malapuram in 1851, but again brought back on the assassination of the Collector (Mr. Conolly) in 1855. The barracks stand to the north of the town, where also is the old Portuguese quarter with a Roman Catholic church built by the Zamorin and presented to Portugal in 1525, and a convent. The southern portion contains the timber depot (Kalliyi) and the Muhammadan quarter, above which lie the sea-customs and salt offices, the lighthouse and mercantile houses, facing the sea. Round the Mananchira tank, a fine reservoir of fresh water, are grouped the chief public offices and many important buildings. The suburbs consist of detached villages joining Calicut to Beypur, and surrounded with groves of palm, mango, and jack (Artocarpus) trees. The climate is fairly healthy, and, the soil being sandy, the deficiency of artificial drainage is not injuriously felt. The birth-rate in 1880-81 was 36'6, and the death-rate 26'2 per 1000. The average annual rainfall is 120 inches.\n\nThe foundation of Calicut is traditionally ascribed to Cheraman Perumal, the lord of Malabar, whose conversion to Islam and departure for Mecca figures so prominently in the legends of the country. On Cheraman's subsequent retirement to Mecca, Calicut was granted by him to Mana Vikrama, the 'Samuri' or Zamorin. Tradition derives the name from the device employed for deciding the limits of the settlement\u2014so much as the crowing of a cock in the Tali Temple could be heard over. The present town dates from the 13th century, and has given its name to the cloth known to the Portuguese as calicute, to the English as calico. The Zamorins rose to great power, extending their dominions, with the aid of the Moors or Moplas, both south and east; and the capital is described by the earliest Portuguese visitors as containing many magnificent buildings. The Moplas, so conspicuous in local history, are the descendants of Arab traders\u201413 in number, according to their own traditions\u2014who settled in the 9th century at Chalam on the Beypur river.\n\nCalicut is celebrated as having been the first port in India visited by Europeans, the Portuguese adventurer Covilham having landed here about 1486. In 1498, Vasco da Gama arrived at Calicut, but at the instigation of the Mopla traders he was inhospitably received by the Zamorin. In 1501, Pedralvarez Cabral established a factory, which was immediately afterwards destroyed by the Moplas, and the whole colony of 50 persons massacred. Cabral bombarded the town; and in the following year Da Gama returned to complete the punishment, destroying all the shipping in the roadstead, and laying all the houses in ruins within range of his guns. In 1510, Albuquerque again attacked Calicut, burnt the Zamorin's palace, and wrecked the town; but the natives, rallying in overwhelming force, drove him back to Cochin with great loss. Three years later, the Zamorin made peace with the Portu-\nguese, who at once erected a factory, the origin of the present establishment. The French settlement dates from 1722, since which year it has been three times in British possession. In 1819 it was finally restored to the French, who still hold a few houses and the land adjoining. The Danish Government established a factory in 1752. It was partially destroyed in 1784, and soon after incorporated in the British settlement. An unsuccessful attempt was made in 1792 to re-establish the claims of Denmark. The first British settlement dates from 1616; but it was not until the treaty of Seringapatam, in 1792, that the Company acquired any sovereign rights. Between those dates Calicut was often conspicuous in history. In 1695, Captain Kidd ravaged the port; and in 1766, when Haidar Ali invaded Malab\u00e1r, the Zamorin shut himself up in his palace and set fire to it, dying with his family in the flames. In 1773, and again in 1788, the town was pillaged by the Mysore armies. In 1790, the British troops occupied the town, holding it till the peace two years later. Since then it has been steadily advancing in trade and population; and, with the exception of fanatical Mopla outbreaks, the public peace has been undisturbed.\n\n**Calimere Point** (the *Calligicum* of Ptolemy).\u2014A low promontory in Tanjore District, forming the most southerly point of the Coromandel Coast, Madras Presidency. Lat. 10\u00b0 18' N., long. 79\u00b0 52' E. The point ought not to be approached within 5\u00bd or 6 fathoms. A pagoda, called Calimere Pagoda, in lat. 10\u00b0 22' N., long. 79\u00b0 51' E., stands about a mile from the shore, and 5\u00bd miles to the north-north-west of the southern extremity of the point. From this pagoda, the direction of the coast is about north \u00bd west to Negapatam; distance, 37 miles;\u2014all the land in this space is low and planted with cocoa-nut trees.\n\n**Calinga.**\u2014Ancient Division of India in Madras Presidency.\u2014See KALINGA.\n\n**Calingapatam.**\u2014Town and port in Ganjam District, Madras Presidency.\u2014See KALINGAPATAM.\n\n**Callayi.**\u2014Seaport town, Madras Presidency.\u2014See KALLAYI.\n\n**Calventura** (*Hinet-taung*, or 'Bird's feather').\u2014A group of rocks off the coast of Arakan, in British Burma, forming two divisions bearing from each other north-west and south-east, and distant 5 or 6 miles. The north-west group (lat. 16\u00b0 55' N., long. 94\u00b0 15' 30\" E.) consists of seven irregular black rocks, one of which resembles an old church with a mutilated spire. The south-east division consists of two high rocky islands covered with vegetation, and connected by a reef with 5 to 7 fathoms of water upon it. About half-way between the islands there is a single rock, dry at low tide.\n\n**Camalapur.**\u2014Town in Bellary District, Madras Presidency.\u2014See KAMALAPUR.\nCambay (Khambh\u00e1t).\u2014Feudatory State within the Political Agency of Kaira, Bombay Presidency; lying at the head of the gulf of the same name in the western part of the Province of Gujar\u00e1t, between 22\u00b0 9' and 22\u00b0 41' N. lat., and between 72\u00b0 20' and 73\u00b0 5' E. long. Bounded on the north by the British District of Kaira; east by the lands of Borsad in Kaira, and Pitl\u0101d belonging to Baroda; south by the Gulf of Cambay; and west by the S\u00e1barmati river, separating it from Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d District. Area, 350 square miles, containing 2 towns and 83 villages; population (1881) 86,074, namely, 70,708 Hindus, 12,417 Muhammadans, and 2949 'others.' The boundaries of the State are very irregular; some villages belonging to the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda and to the British Government are entirely surrounded by Cambay territory, while Cambay villages are found in Kaira District. The country is flat and open, interspersed here and there, generally in the vicinity of the villages, with groves of fine trees, such as the mango, tamarind, banian or bar, n\u00edim, and p\u00edpal. From the position of the State between two large tidal rivers, the soil is so soaked with salt that water becomes brackish at a little distance below the surface, and in many places new wells have to be sunk every five years. Besides being brackish, Cambay well water is unwholesome, often causing painful boils when incautiously used.\n\nTowards the north and west the soil is generally black, and well suited for the cultivation of wheat and cotton. To the east it is fit only for the growth of inferior sorts of grain, abundant crops of which are grown in favourable years. The cultivators are principally dependent on the monsoon rains for the means of irrigation, there being but few wells. The supply of drinking water is chiefly drawn from ponds or reservoirs, in which water is found throughout the greater part of the year. Near the city of Cambay skirting the shore of the gulf, and along the banks of the Mahi and S\u00e1barmati rivers, stretch vast tracts of salt marsh land submerged at high spring-tides. Nodular limestone or kankar mixed with sand and clay is found in large quantities from 10 to 15 feet below the surface of the soil. Although not of the best quality, the lime obtained from this stone is used by the people of the country for building and other purposes. There are no forests. Agricultural products consist of the ordinary varieties of millet and pulse, rice, wheat, cotton, indigo, tobacco, and a little opium. The cultivation of indigo has of late years greatly fallen off. The chief wild animals are the nilg\u00e1i (Portax pictus), wild hog, and large herds of antelopes that feed on the short herbage on salt marsh lands near the sea-coast. During the cold weather every pond swarms with duck, teal, and snipe.\n\nThe population consists of the various Hindu castes found throughout Guzer\u00e1t, including the wild tribes of Kol\u00eds and Wagris; Muhammadans, Jains, and P\u00e1rs\u00eds. The languages used are Gujar\u00edth\u00ed and Hindust\u00e1n\u00ed.\nThe chief articles of manufacture are indigo, salt, cloth, carpets, embroidery, and carved cornelians, which are imported from Ratanpur and other places in the R\u00e1jp\u00edpla State. The chocolate-coloured stone is brought from K\u00e1thi\u00e1war; agates come from Kapadwanj and Sukaltirth on the Narbad\u00e1 (Nerbudda) river, and from R\u00e1jkot in K\u00e1thi\u00e1war.\n\nThe total imports 1877\u201378, consisting chiefly of molasses, timber, clarified butter, grain, cornelians, metal, piece-goods, silk, cocoa-nuts, and sugar were valued at \u00a3131,730; and the exports of tobacco, wrought cornelians, and sundries, at \u00a390,017. In 1878, the shipping of the port of Cambay amounted in all to 566 vessels of a total burthen of 10,000 tons. Ships of more than 50 tons never visit Cambay. There are no made roads within the limits of the Cambay territory. The mode of transit into the interior is by native carts, camels, or pack-bullocks. For communication by water, except during the monsoon months, boats of under 6 tons at ordinary tides, and under 50 tons at spring tides, ply between Cambay and Bombay, Surat, Broach, Gogo, and other ports. The head of the gulf forms neither a safe nor commodious harbour, in consequence of the constant shifting of its bed from the force of the tides and the currents of the rivers M\u00e1hi and S\u00e1barmati.\n\nThe name Cambay or Khambh\u00e1t is said to be derived from kh\u00e1mbha or stambhatirth, the pool of Mah\u00e1deva under the form of the pillar god. Cambay is mentioned by Masudi (913); but the prosperity of the city is traditionally referred to the grant of its present site to a body of Br\u00e1hmans in 997. During the 11th and 12th centuries, Cambay appears as one of the chief ports of the Anhelw\u00e1ra kingdom; and at the conquest of that kingdom by the Musalm\u00e1ns in 1297, it is said to have been one of the richest towns in India.\n\nAccording to Lieutenant Robertson's Historical Narrative of Cambay, the P\u00e1rs\u00eds of Gujar\u00e1t sailed from Persia about the end of the 7th or beginning of the 8th century. A great number of their ships foundered in a storm, and only a few arrived at Sejam, about 70 miles south of Surat. They obtained permission to land after some difficulty, and on certain conditions; the chief of which were\u2014that they should speak the Guzer\u00e1th\u00ed language, and abstain from beef. The P\u00e1rs\u00eds remained for many years in the vicinity of Sejam, pursuing a coasting trade; but eventually they spread over the neighbouring Districts, and became so numerous at Cambay that they outnumbered the original inhabitants and took possession of the town. After a short period, however, they were driven out with great slaughter by the Hindus, who held the territory until conquered by the Muhammadans in 1297.\n\nIn the 15th century, with the growing wealth and power of the Gujar\u00e1t kingdom, Cambay regained its former prosperity, and at the beginning of the 16th century formed one of the chief centres of commerce in India.\nDuring the time of the Muhammadan Kings of Gujar\u00e1t, Cambay was in a most flourishing condition. Large vessels unloaded their cargoes at Gogo, whence they were sent in small craft to Cambay. The passage between the two ports was so quick as to become proverbial. The founder of the present family of Cambay rulers was Momin Kh\u00e1n, the last but one of the Muhammadan governors of Guzer\u00e1t. While he held the office of Governor, his son-in-law, Niz\u00e1m Kh\u00e1n, had charge of Cambay. On Momin Kh\u00e1n's death in 1742, his son Muftukh\u00e1r Kh\u00e1n basely compassed the death of Niz\u00e1m Kh\u00e1n, and assumed the government of Cambay. The Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 leaders had already partitioned Gujar\u00e1t; but Muftukh\u00e1r Kh\u00e1n successfully resisted the claims of the Peshw\u00e1 to tribute, until, by the treaty of Bassein, Cambay was ceded to the British Government. The principal item of this disputed tribute consisted of a nominal half-share in the sea and land customs, deducting cost of collection. The British Government found much difficulty in inducing the Naw\u00e1b to revise the complicated and onerous tariff of sea customs, which was highly injurious to trade; but, in 1856, an arrangement was made by which the methods of collection are assimilated to those obtaining in civilised countries.\n\nThe ruler is a Muhammadan of the Shi\u00e1 sect. His position is that of a feudatory of the British Government. He has received a sanad, guaranteeing any succession to his State that may be legitimate according to Muhammadan law. He has first-class jurisdiction, having power to try for capital offences any persons except European British subjects, and is entitled to a salute of 11 guns. Tribute is paid to the British Government of \u00a3295 in cash, exclusive of collections on account of customs and excise. The military force consists of 200 cavalry and 900 foot, for the most part undisciplined. The police of the State number 337. The annual gross revenue in 1880\u201381, inclusive of transit duties on all goods, Indian and foreign, was estimated at \u00a342,613. Public instruction is conducted by 2 public and 28 private indigenous schools, with 291 pupils in the former, and 753 in the latter.\n\nBeing within the influence of the sea-breezes, the climate of Cambay is generally milder and more equable than that of the interior of Gujar\u00e1t. The most prevalent diseases are fever and dysentery. The average yearly rainfall is returned at 29'30 inches.\n\nCambay (Khambh\u00e1t).\u2014Chief town in the Native State of Cambay, Province of Gujar\u00e1t, Bombay Presidency; situated at the head of the Gulf of Cambay, on the north of the estuary of the river M\u00e1hi. Lat. 22\u00b0 18' 30\" N., long. 72\u00b0 40' E. Distant 52 miles south of Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d, and 202 miles west of Mhau (Mhow). Population (1881) 36,007, namely, 25,314 Hindus, 8038 Muhammadans, 2525 Jains, 8 Christians, 119 P\u00e1rs\u00eds, and 3 'others.' The city was originally surrounded by a brick wall perforated for musketry, flanked with irregular towers without\nfosse or esplanade; but the works are now out of repair, and few of the guns mounted are serviceable. Only portions of the wall remain, enclosing a circumference of not more than 3 miles. The palace of the Naw\u00e1b is in good repair, but built in an inferior style of architecture. The Jam\u00e1 Masjid was erected in 1325 A.D., in the time of Muhammad Sh\u00e1h; the pillars in the interior were taken from desecrated Jain temples, and, though arranged without much attention to architectural effect, give the mosque a picturesque appearance. Many ruins still attest the former wealth of Cambay. It is mentioned, under the name of Cambaet, as a place of great trade by Marco Polo (circa 1293), and by his countryman and contemporary, Marino Sanudo, as one of the two great trading ports of India (Cambeth).\n\nThe commercial decline of this once flourishing mart is due in great measure to the silting up of the gulf, and to the 'bore' or rushing tide in the north of the gulf, and at the entrances of the M\u00e1hi and S\u00e1barmati (Savarnamati) rivers. High spring-tides rise and fall as much as 33 feet, and the current runs at a velocity of from 6 to 7 knots an hour. In ordinary springs the rise and fall is 25 feet, and the current 4\u00bd to 6 knots. Great damage is thus frequently caused to shipping, the more as the average depth of the channel is only from 4 to 6 fathoms; and the hazard is greatly increased by the constantly-shifting shoals, caused by the frequent inundation of the rivers. Cambay is celebrated for the manufacture of agate, cornelian, and onyx ornaments. The cornelians come chiefly from mines in the vicinity of Ratanpur, in the Native State of R\u00e1jpipla, Rew\u00e1 K\u00e1ntha. The preparation of the stones was thus described in 1821 by Mr. J. Willoughby, Assistant to the Resident at Baroda: 'The Bhils, who are the miners, commence their operations about September and leave off in April, when they commence burning the cornelians. The operation of burning is performed by digging a hole one yard square, in which are placed earthen pots filled with the cornelians, which to facilitate the process have for some time previous been exposed to the sun. The bottoms of the pots are taken out, and a layer of about 6 or 7 inches of cow or goat dung, strewed above and below them, is set on fire, which, when consumed, has rendered the stones ready for the Cambay merchants.' The three principal colours of the cornelians are red, white, and yellow, the first of which is considered the most valuable.\n\n**Cambay Gulf** (or **Gulf of Cambay**). \u2014 The strip of sea which separates the Peninsula of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r from the northern Bombay coast. The gulf was in ancient times a great resort of commerce, much frequented by Arab mariners. Surat lies at the eastern point of its mouth; the Portuguese settlement of Diu at the western mouth, and Cambay Town at its northern extremity. The gulf receives the two great rivers, the T\u00e1pt\u00ed and Narbad\u00e1 (Nerbudda), on its eastern side;\nthe M\u00e1hi and S\u00e1barmati (Savarnamati) on the north, and several small rivers from K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r on the west. Owing to the causes mentioned under Cambay Town, the gulf is silting up, and is now resorted to only by small craft. The once famous harbours (Surat and Broach, which see separately) around its coast have ceased to be used by foreign commerce.\n\nCamel\u2019s Hump (Wavoolmullay of Indian Atlas).\u2014Mountain peak in the Calicut taluk, Malab\u00e1r District, Madras Presidency. Height, 7677 feet above the sea. Situated 26 miles north-east of Calicut, in lat. 11\u00b0 26' N., and long. 76\u00b0 10' E.\n\nCampbellpur.\u2014Small cantonment in Attock tahsil, R\u00e1wal Pindi District, Punjab. Lat. 33\u00b0 47' N., long. 72\u00b0 23' E. Occupied by a regiment of European cavalry. Known to the natives by the name of Kamalpur, derived from the tomb of Kamal Sh\u00e1h, a Sayyid, which stands in the village, and is an object of religious veneration among the people of the neighbourhood. Population (1881) 1467, namely, Hindus, 775; Sikhs, 22; Jains, 3; Muhammadans, 455; and \u2018others,\u2019 212.\n\nC\u00e1nara, North.\u2014District of Bombay Presidency.\u2014See Kanara.\n\nC\u00e1nara, South.\u2014District of Madras Presidency.\u2014See Kanara.\n\nCandahar.\u2014Town in Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n.\u2014See Kandahar.\n\nCannanore (Kann\u00far or Kannan\u00far, \u2018Kannan\u2019s Town\u2019).\u2014Town and port in Malab\u00e1r District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 11\u00b0 51' 12\" N., long. 75\u00b0 24' 44\" E.; population (1881) 26,386, namely, 10,656 Hindus, 11,617 Muhammadans, and 4087 Christians; municipal income in 1880-81, \u00a32658, of which \u00a3627 was allotted for sanitary purposes; incidence of taxation, about 10\u00bdd. per head. The birth-rate in 1880-81 was 26, the death-rate 18\u00b77 per 1000 of municipal population. Being the head-quarters of the Chirrakal taluk, Cannanore contains the usual public offices, magisterial and judicial, jail, dispensary, schools, etc.; and it has also a custom house and marine establishment. The value of the sea-going trade during 1880-81 was\u2014imports, \u00a3202,051; exports, \u00a3102,050.\n\nBut the chief importance of Cannanore arises from its position as a military cantonment. It is the head-quarters of the Malab\u00e1r and K\u00e1nara force, being the station of a general of division, with his staff, and is garrisoned by 1 European and 1 Native regiment of infantry. The cantonment is spacious, and intersected by good roads, with two parade grounds, ordnance depot, brigade and commissariat offices, etc. It lies to the north-east of the fort, a triangular building covering a rocky point which juts out into the sea. Across the bay lies the Mopla (M\u00e1ppilla) quarter of Cannanore, where the descendants of the old Arab sea-kings of Cannanore reside, the town being otherwise remarkable for the number of its mosques, two of which are of special fame. Within its limits stands the fishing village of Th\u00e1\u00ed, with a\nRoman Catholic chapel, once a Portuguese factory. The cantonment was made a municipality in 1867, and in 1872 the town proper was brought under the Towns Improvement Act. Anglican, German, and Roman Catholic missions are established here, with schools attached. The average annual rainfall is 97 inches.\n\nCannanore was, according to the legend of the partition of his dominions by Cheraman Perum\u00e1l, included in the kingdom of the Chirrakal R\u00e1j\u00e1s, to whom the Mopla (M\u00e1ppilla) sea-kings (Ali R\u00e1j\u00e1s) owned suzerainty, more or less nominal, down to the time of Haidar Ali's invasion of Malab\u00e1r. In 1498, Vasco da Gama touched here, and, being well received, a colony was planted. Seven years later Vasco da Gama erected a factory. In 1656, the Dutch effected a settlement, for the protection of which they built the present fort, which they occupied till 1766, when it fell into the hands of the Mysore troops. In 1784, Cannanore was captured by the British, and the reigning Princess became tributary to the East India Company. Seven years later, it was again taken; and since that date has remained in British hands as the chief military station on the Malab\u00e1r coast, under the Madras Presidency.\n\n**Canning, Port.**\u2014River port on the Matl\u00e1 river, Bengal.\u2014See Port CANNING.\n\n**Caragola.**\u2014Town and river gh\u00e1t in Purniah District, Bengal.\u2014See KARAGOLA.\n\n**Cardamom Hills.**\u2014Range of hills in Travancore State, Madras Presidency, lying between 9\u00b0 27' and 10\u00b0 4' N. lat., and between 76\u00b0 52' and 77\u00b0 17' E. long. Average height, from 2000 to 4000 feet above the sea. The hills are divided roughly into the 'Margari Alum' and 'Kunni Alum' groups, both very sparsely populated, and unhealthy. The Kunni Alum, though at a lower average elevation, lies within the influence of the sea-breeze, and enjoys, therefore, a rather better climate than the Margari Alum. The cardamoms collected on these hills amount annually to about 60 tons, valued at \u00a330,000; they thrive best at an elevation of 3000 feet. With the exception of a few small coffee estates on the southern slopes, the hills possess no other economic value.\n\n**Carnatic.**\u2014Geographical Division of Madras Presidency.\u2014See KARNATIC.\n\n**Cashmere.**\u2014Native State on the north-east frontier of the Punjab.\u2014See KASHMIR.\n\n**Cassergode (K\u00e1saragodu).**\u2014T\u00e1luk in South Kanara District, Madras Presidency. Area, 1032 square miles, containing 243 villages. Houses, 45,287. Population (1881) 243,881, namely, 120,857 males and 123,024 females. Land revenue, \u00a324,367; 1 civil and 2 criminal courts.\nCassergode (K\u00e1saragodu; \u2018Kangercote\u2019 of the Tohfat-al-Maj\u00e1h\u00edld\u00edn).\u2014Town in South K\u00e1nara District, Madras Presidency; situated on the Chandragiri river, in lat. 12\u00b0 29' 50\" N., and long. 75\u00b0 2' 10\" E.; population (1872) 6416; number of houses, 1178. No later population statistics are available to me, as the town has now less than five thousand inhabitants. The southernmost post of the ancient Tuluva kingdom, with an ancient fort of the Ikkeri kings.\n\nCauvery (K\u00e1veri; the X\u00e1\u03b2\u03b7\u03bdpos of the Greek geographer Ptolemy).\u2014A great river of Southern India, famous alike for its traditional sanctity, its picturesque scenery, and its utility for irrigation. Rising on the Brahmagiri, a hill in Coorg, high up amid the Western Gh\u00e1ts, in 12\u00b0 25' N. lat. and 75\u00b0 34' E. long., it flows with a generally south-east direction across the plateau of Mysore, and finally pours itself into the Bay of Bengal, through two principal mouths in the Madras District of Tanjore; total length, about 475 miles; estimated area of drainage basin, 28,000 square miles. It is known to devout Hindus as Dakshin Gang\u00e1, or the Ganges of the South, and the whole of its course is holy ground. According to the legend preserved in the Agneya and Sk\u00e1nda Pur\u00e1\u1e47as, there was once born upon earth a girl named Vishnum\u00e1y\u00e1 or Lop\u00e1mudr\u00e1, the daughter of Brahma; but her divine father permitted her to be regarded as the child of a mortal, called K\u00e1vera-m\u00fani. In order to obtain beatitude for her adoptive father, she resolved to become a river whose waters should purify from all sin. Hence it is that even the holy Gang\u00e1 resorts underground, once in the year, to the source of the Cauvery, to purge herself from the pollution contracted from the crowd of sinners who have bathed in her waters. At Tala K\u00e1veri, where the river rises, and at Bh\u00e1gamandala, where it receives its first tributary, stand ancient temples annually frequented by crowds of pilgrims in the month of Tul\u00e1m\u00e1sa (October\u2013November).\n\nThe course of the Cauvery in Coorg is tortuous. Its bed is rocky; its banks are high and covered with luxuriant vegetation. In the dry season it is fordable almost anywhere, but during the rains it swells into a torrent 20 or 30 feet deep. In this portion of its course it is joined by many tributaries\u2014the Kak\u00e1be, Kadan\u00far, Kumma-hole, Mutt\u00e1remutta, Chikka-hole, and Suvarnavati or H\u00e1ringi. Near the frontier, at the station of Fraserpet, it is spanned by a magnificent stone bridge, 516 feet in length. On entering Mysore, the Cauvery passes through a narrow gorge, but presently widens to an average breadth of from 300 to 400 yards. Its bed continues rocky, so as to forbid all navigation; but its banks are here bordered with a rich strip of wet cultivation. In its course through Mysore, the channel is interrupted by no less than twelve anicuts or dams for the purpose of irrigation. From the most important of these, known as the Madadkatte, an artificial channel is led off 72 miles in length, which irrigates an area of about 10,000 acres,\nwith a revenue of \u00a37000, and ultimately brings a water-supply into the town of Mysore. In this portion of its course it forms the two islands of Seri ngapatanam and Sivasamudram, which vie in sanctity with the island of Srirangam lower down in Trichinopoli District.\n\nEnclosing the island of Sivasamudram are the celebrated falls of the Cauvery, unrivalled for romantic beauty. The river here branches into two channels, each of which makes a descent of about 200 feet in a succession of rapids and broken cascades. The scene has been rendered accessible to visitors by the private munificence of a native of Mysore, who has constructed two stone bridges of rude but solid workmanship to connect the island with either bank. More than one tragic story of former days has gathered round this picturesque spot. The Mysore tributaries of the Cauvery are the Hemavati, Lakshmantirtha, Lokap\u00e1vani, Shimsha, Arkavati, and Suvarnavati, or Honnu-hole. After entering the territory of Madras, it forms the boundary between the two Districts of Coimbatore and Salem for a considerable distance, until it strikes into Trichinopoli District. Sweeping past the historic rock of Trichinopoli, it breaks at the island of Srirangam into two channels, which enclose between them the delta of Tanjore, the garden of Southern India. The more northerly of these channels is called the Coleroon (Kolidam); that which continues the course of the river towards the east preserves the name of the Cauvery. On the seaward face of the delta are the open roadsteads of Tranquebar, Negapatam, and French K\u00e1rikal.\n\nThe only navigation on any portion of the Cauvery is carried on in boats of basket-work. In Madras the chief tributaries are the Bhav\u00e1ni, Noyel, and Amravati. At Erode the river is crossed by the main line of the Madras Railway, by means of an iron-girder bridge, 1536 feet long with 72 spans, on piers sunk into the solid rock. The total cost of this structure was \u00a340,000.\n\nAlthough the water of the Cauvery is utilized for agriculture in Mysore and also in Coimbatore District, it is in the delta that its real value for irrigation becomes conspicuous. At Srirangam, just above the point of bifurcation, the flood discharge is estimated at 472,000 feet per second. The problem of utilizing this storehouse of agricultural wealth was first grappled with by a prehistoric Hindu king, who constructed a massive dam of unhewn stone, 1080 feet long and from 40 to 60 feet broad, across the stream of the Cauvery proper. This dam, which is supposed to date back to the 4th century A.D., is still in excellent repair, and has supplied a typical model to our own engineers. When the British first came into possession of Tanjore District, in 1801, it was found that the great volume of the water-supply was then passing unused down the Coleroon, which is mainly a drainage channel; while the Cauvery proper was gradually silting up, and the irrigating channels that take\noff from it were becoming dry. The object of the engineering works that have been since constructed is to redress this unequal tendency, and to compel either channel to carry the maximum of water that can be put to good use. The chief modern work is the dam or anicut across the Coleroon, constructed by Sir Arthur Cotton between 1836 and 1838. This dam is 2250 feet long, broken by islands into three sections. The body is of brick, capped with cut stone. Its thickness is 6 feet, supported in the rear by an apron of masonry, 21 feet broad. By means of an elaborate system of self-acting sluices, which have been constructed in subsequent years, the discharge of the two rivers has now been so accurately regulated that neither is being choked with silt, while the surplus water-supply of both is made available for irrigation through a countless number of distributaries. The area already irrigated from this source in 1880 in the three Districts of Tanjore, Trichinopoly, and South Arcot, was 814,366 acres, yielding a revenue of \u00a3357,076.\n\nCawnpur (correctly, K\u00e1nhpur). \u2014 District in the Lieutenant-Governorship of the North-Western Provinces, lying between 25\u00b0 56' 15\" and 26\u00b0 57' N. lat., and between 79\u00b0 34' 45\" and 80\u00b0 38' E. long.; area, 2370 square miles; population in 1881, 1,181,396 souls. Cawnpur is the westernmost District of the Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d Division; bounded on the north-east by the Ganges, on the west by Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d and Et\u00e1wah, on the south-west by the Jumna (Jamun\u00e1), and on the east by Fatehpur. The administrative head-quarters are at CAWNPUR CITY.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The District of Cawnpur forms part of the Do\u00e1b, or great alluvial plain between the Ganges and the Jumna; and it does not materially differ in its general features from other portions of that monotonous tract. It consists for the most part of a level plateau, only varied by the courses of the minor streams whose waters swell the great boundary rivers, the Ganges and Jumna, and by the steep ravines which channel the friable soil of the plain. The country has a slight general slope towards the south-west, and all the river channels trend in that direction. It is divided into four main sections by the streams which collect and carry away the surface drainage. The Isan cuts off a small angle to the north, joining the Ganges shortly after its entry within the limits of Cawnpur; next come the P\u00e1ndu and the Rind, which traverse the midland portion of the District from end to end; while to the extreme south, the Sengur falls into the Jumna, and encloses between itself and the main stream a triangular wedge of land. The banks of the two last-named rivers are marked by extensive ravines of great depth, which ramify in every direction from the central gorge. Their soil is almost entirely uncultivable, and they have a wild and desolate appearance, contrasting strongly with the rich and peaceful aspect of the cultivated country above.\n\nThe Ganges and Jumna are navigable throughout Cawnpur District\nduring the rains, for boats of large burthen, but the frequent shallows in\nthe dry season close navigation to all but small boats. The smaller\nrivers are dry or nearly so, except in the rains, or when surplus canal\nwater is discharged into them. In the rains they are crossed by rude\nboats, or by rafts made of a dozen inverted large earthen pots bearing\na platform of hurdle work. Until 1875, the Ganges at Cawnpur was\ncrossed by a pontoon bridge, which on the completion of the Oudh and\nRohilkhand railway bridge was removed to Kalpi. The Jumna is\ncrossed by a bridge of boats, which gives place to a ferry during the\nmonsoon. There are from forty to fifty ferries in the District; but\nexcept those over the Ganges, they are only maintained during the\nrainy months.\n\nThe clay of the upland plain is naturally dry and thirsty, but it\nhas been converted into a prosperous agricultural region by the\nwaters of the Ganges Canal. No fewer than four branches of that\ngreat engineering work enter the District of Cawnpur at different points;\nwhile minor distributaries run from these in every direction over the\nsurrounding fields. The plain is now one of the most flourishing\nportions of the Do\u00e1b, and only an occasional strip of *isar*, whitened\nby the efflorescence known as *reh*, breaks the general prospect of\ncultivated fields. No lake of any size exists in the District, but\nthere are several *jhils* or swamps, and a few small patches of water\nare formed by the overflow of the canal. A peculiar feature in *pargan\u00e1*\nSikandra is a long drainage line known as *jhil* Sonau, which stretches\nright across the *pargan\u00e1* into *pargan\u00e1* Bhognipur, where its channel\ndeepens into a regular watercourse. As its windings follow those of\nthe Jumna, from which it is distant about two miles, it may be an\nancient bed of that river, but no tradition exists to support this theory.\nAfter the rains, the lower levels are occupied by shallow ponds, particu-\nlarly where irrigation trenches connected with the Ganges Canal intersect\nthe natural lines of drainage, thus producing a temporary dam; but the\npools which collect under these circumstances are soon drained dry by\nthe cultivators to water their fields. Groves of tamarind and *mah\u00fa\u00e1*\nnot uncommonly overshadow the village temples or the more ambitious\nmosques. There is no forest land, but here and there tracts of waste\nland are covered with *dh\u00e1k* jungle (Butea frondosa), which, however,\nis fast disappearing before the extension of cultivation. The fauna of\nthe District includes leopards, wolves, *nilg\u00e1\u00ed*, antelope, deer, foxes, wild\nhog, and jackals; partridges, peafowl, and sand-grouse abound, while\nwaterfowl are common in the low-lying marshy flats.\n\n*History.*\u2014The District of Cawnpur is an administrative creation of\nBritish rule, not dating further back than the latter half of the last\ncentury. Under the Muhammadan system its various *pargan\u00e1s* were\ndistributed between the *Subahs* of Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d and Agra, and its early\nhistory, so far as known, is identical with that of the surrounding Districts. The Do\u00e1b was conquered by Sh\u00e1hb-ud-d\u00edn Ghori in 1194 A.D.; and it remained a fief of the various dynasties at Delhi until the establishment of the Mughal power in the 16th century. B\u00e1bar subdued the country in 1529; and it became at a somewhat later date the chief scene of the protracted struggle between his son Hum\u00e1y\u00fan and the Pathan Governor of Bengal, Sher Sh\u00e1h. One or two mosques and other public buildings in the smaller towns still bear witness to the rule of Aurangzeb; but comparatively few traces of the family of B\u00e1bar now remain scattered through the District, as it contained hardly any towns of importance during the palmy epoch of the Mughals. On the decline of the Delhi Empire, the country about Cawnpur, with the remainder of the Do\u00e1b, was overrun by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s in 1736. It continued in their hands till 1747, when it was recovered by Safdar Jang, the Naw\u00e1b Wazir of Oudh.\n\nThe city of Cawnpur was not founded till after our victories of Buxar and Kora in 1764\u201365, when the Naw\u00e1b Wazir Shuja-ud-daul\u00e1 agreed to pay a tribute of 50 l\u00e1khs of rupees, and to permit the establishment of two cantonments for British troops within his dominions, one at Cawnpur and the other at Fatehgarh. The troops were at first stationed at Bilgr\u00e1m, but were removed to Cawnpur in 1778. A city soon sprang up around the military lines, adorned with many handsome mosques and other buildings, but bearing its recent origin somewhat obtrusively upon its face. By the treaty of 1801, the Naw\u00e1b Wazir ceded to the British the whole lower Do\u00e1b, together with other territory, in commutation of the stipulated tribute, which experience had shown to be in a perpetual condition of arrears. A District of Cawnpur was immediately organized, with much more extensive boundaries than those which at present limit it, and embracing certain pargan\u00e1s now transferred, by the necessity for more active and energetic administration, to Et\u00e1wah, Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d, and Fatehpur. Our early officials found the country suffering heavily from the fiscal exactions of its native rulers; and the first step needful for the re-establishment of agricultural prosperity was a reduction of the land revenue. A series of reduced settlements were effected at various dates in the early part of the present century, and the District began rapidly to revive under the firm and peaceful rule of its new masters.\n\nNo event in the modern annals of Cawnpur calls for special notice until the unhappy incidents of the Mutiny of 1857. The part which the city bore in that great struggle is a matter of imperial rather than of local history. Although we never lost possession of Cawnpur District for more than a few days during the whole rebellion, yet we had to maintain a continuous contest with the insurgents from May to December 1857. B\u00e1j\u00ed R\u00e1o, the last of the Peshw\u00e1s,\nhad taken up his residence, in exile, at the picturesque little town of Bith\u00far on the Ganges, in this District. On the Peshwa's death his adopted son, Dundhu Panth, was not permitted to assume the titles of his father. As 'Nana Sahib' his name has since become familiar upon every lip. Shortly after the outbreak at Meerut, this disaffected prince was placed in charge of the treasury at Cawnpur. Early in June it was thought desirable to entrench the barracks, and all Europeans were brought within the entrenchment. On the 6th of June, the 2nd Cavalry and 1st Native Infantry rose in revolt, seized the treasury, broke open the jail, and burnt the public offices. They then marched out one stage on the road to Delhi, and were joined by the 53rd and 54th Regiments. The N\u00e1n\u00e1 immediately went out to their camp, and persuaded them, by promises of pillage, to return. He next attacked the entrenched Europeans with a brisk cannonade, kept up for three weeks.\n\nThe strength of the garrison within the entrenchments will never be known, but it has been estimated at between 750 and 1000, including persons of every rank and colour, sex and age\u2014about 400 males being able to bear arms. The siege called from the beleaguered a display of heroism unsurpassed in history. Under an almost vertical sun, with the thermometer at between 100\u00b0 and 120\u00b0 F., the little band fought with dogged valour behind their wretched bulwarks, their eyes sore with dust and glare, and their hands blistered with the heated gun-barrels. Three assaults by the rebels were defeated, but at great loss of life to the defenders. Many died from sunstroke, and women and children were struck down by bullets as well as fighting men.\n\nBy the 26th of June, the position of the besieged became untenable, and they capitulated on a sworn promise of protection. The N\u00e1n\u00e1 agreed to send them to Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d, and next day they marched out to the Satichaura gh\u00e1t or landing-place and got into the boats; but before they could push off, they were fired on from all sides. Two boats only got under weigh, one of which was at once swamped by a round shot; the other went down the river under fire from both banks, and most of the Europeans were killed. A few escaped for a while to Shior\u00e1jpur, where some were captured, and the remainder massacred, except four. The soldiers in the boats were mostly shot upon the spot; the women and children were carried off to the Sav\u00e1da Kothi, where they were all cut to pieces, by the N\u00e1n\u00e1's orders, at the first sound of Havelock's guns outside Cawnpur. About 200 hundred bodies were taken out of the well into which they were thrown, where the well-known Memorial now stands.\n\nGeneral Havelock fought the battles of Aung and the P\u00e1ndu Nad\u00ed on the 15th of July, and next day took Cawnpur by storm. The 17th and 18th were devoted to the recovery of the city, and the 19th to the destruction of Bith\u00far and the N\u00e1n\u00e1's palaces. Two or\nthree unsuccessful attempts to cross into Oudh were hazarded, but no actual advance was made until the arrival of reinforcements under General Outram towards the end of August. Lord Clyde's column passed through to the relief of Lucknow on the 19th of October, and Colonel Greathed followed a week later. In November, the Gwalior mutineers crossed the Jumna, and, being joined by a large force of Oudh rebels, attacked Cawnpur on the 27th, and obtained possession of the city, which they held till Lord Clyde marched in the next evening. On the 6th of December, Lord Clyde routed them with great loss, and took all their guns. General Walpole then led a column through the country towns, restoring order in Akbarpur, Rasulabad, and Derapur. The District was not completely pacified till after the fall of Kalpi in May 1858; but that event rendered its reorganization easy, and when Firoz Shah fled through it in December 1858, his passage caused no disturbance.\n\nPopulation.\u2014Cawnpur is one of the Districts where agriculture and population have almost reached their utmost limit, and there is a tendency to emigration towards other parts of the country, where employment is more easily obtained. In 1853, the total population was returned at 1,174,556 persons. In 1865, it had risen to 1,192,836; but in 1872, with a slight decrease of area, the number was ascertained to be 1,156,055. The last Census, in 1881, taken upon an area of 2370 square miles (or 34 square miles in excess of the area returned in 1872), disclosed a total population of 1,181,396 persons, distributed among 1970 villages or towns, and inhabiting an aggregate of 201,172 houses. These figures yield the following averages:\u2014Persons per square mile, 498\u00b74; villages per square mile, '8; houses per square mile, 84\u00b78; persons per village, 600; persons per house, 5\u00b78. Classified according to sex, there were\u2014males, 628,891; females, 552,505; proportion of males, 53\u00b72 per cent. As regards religious distinctions, Cawnpur is more essentially Hindu than the neighbouring Districts. In 1881, the Census returned the Hindus at 1,084,964, or 91\u00b79 per cent. of the population; Muhammadans numbered 93,073, or 7\u00b78 per cent.; Christians, 3200; Jains, 114; Jews, 23; Parsis, 16; and Sikhs, 6. Among the Hindu population, the Brahmins rank first, in numbers as in caste, with a total of 181,234 persons. The Rajputs were returned at 91,722 persons. These two castes form the chief land-holding bodies in the District. The Baniyas had 38,489 members, engaged, as usual, in commercial pursuits. Of the inferior castes, the Chamars (129,713) were the most numerous; most of them are labourers in the poorest condition. Next come the Ahirs (117,090), Kurmis (55,437), Kachhis (48,472), Gadarias (42,507), Koris (41,547), Lodhas (42,185), Telis (27,769), and Nais (25,845). Amongst Musalm\u00e1n tribes, the Shaikhs are the most important.\nWith regard to the occupations of the people, the Census Report classifies the male population into the following six main divisions:\u2014(1) Professional class, including Government officials, military, and the learned professions, 17,506; (2) domestic servants, hotel and lodging-house keepers, etc., 4044; (3) commercial class, including merchants, traders, carriers, etc., 15,611; (4) agricultural and pastoral class, including gardeners, 277,375; (5) manufacturing, artisan, and other industrial classes, 84,913; (6) indefinite and non-productive (comprising 36,451 labourers, 8 men of rank and property, and 192,983 unspecified, including children), 229,442.\n\nThe village organization is of the same general type which is common throughout the Lower Do\u00e1b. First comes the body of landowners, generally R\u00e1jputs or Br\u00e1hmans; below them rank the old hereditary cultivators, who possess rights of occupancy, and are often descendants or clansmen of former landowners; third in social importance are the Baniy\u00e1s, shopkeepers, and petty bankers; the fourth stratum consists of tenants-at-will, who till the land for a bare subsistence; while the lowest class of all is composed of the artisans and labourers, indispensable to the native system, such as the barber, the potter, the washerman, the tanner, the scavenger, and the water-carrier.\n\nThe District contained in 1881 four towns with upwards of 5000 inhabitants, namely, Cawnpur City (including cantonments), 151,444; Bith\u00far, 6685; Bilhaur, 5589; and Akbarpur, 5131. These figures show an urban population of 169,149 persons, leaving 1,012,147 for the rural population. The greater part of the inhabitants are scattered over the face of the country in small villages. Of the total of 1970 villages and towns, 530 contained less than 200 inhabitants, 785 from 200 to 500, 394 from 500 to 1000, 204 from 1000 to 2000, and 61 upwards of 2000 inhabitants. The male adult agricultural population was returned at 275,494, or 23'32 per cent. of the total population, 11,555 being returned as landholders, 210,368 as cultivators, 1532 as estate officers, and 52,039 as agricultural labourers.\n\nAs regards the condition of the people, the Settlement Officer has come to the conclusion that though a certain proportion of the agricultural class, such as Cham\u00e1rs and many Muhammadans, live barely above starvation-point, yet the cultivating population as a whole are fairly well off. The extension of irrigation and the rise in the prices of produce has placed the industrial classes above want; while the increased demand for labour has given a greater fixity to the daily income, small as it is, of the labouring class. Careful calculations by the Settlement Officer show that a Cham\u00e1r, with a five-acre holding, ought to make a profit of \u00a34, 12s. per annum; a Kachh\u00ed (market-gardener), with an eight-acre holding, a profit of \u00a39, 1s. per annum; and a Kurm\u00ed, with fifteen acres, a profit of \u00a313, 11s. per annum. In\nthis calculation, the profit includes the wages of the cultivator, and the labour of his wife and family.\n\n**Agriculture.**\u2014The system of tillage in Cawnpur is that common to the whole Do\u00e1b. There are two main agricultural seasons, the *kharif*, or autumn harvest, and the *rabi*, or spring harvest. The *kharif* crops are sown after the first rain in June, and include rice, maize, *bijra*, *jo\u00e1r*, cotton, indigo, etc. Most of these staples are reaped in October, but the early rice is harvested in September, while cotton is not ready for picking until February. The *rabi* crops are sown in October or November, and reaped in March or April; they consist chiefly of wheat, barley, oats, peas, and pulses. Manure is used, where it can be obtained, for both harvests, and land is allowed to lie fallow whenever the cultivator can afford it. Spring and autumn crops are not often taken off the same land; but sometimes a crop of early rice is reaped in September, and a second crop of some other kind is put into the ground in the following month. The staple product of the District is wheat, but the cultivation of cotton has received a great impetus since the American war. Among the minor crops are oil-seeds, opium, spices, tobacco, and potatoes. Sugar-cane is extensively grown on the better soils, and indigo is specially cultivated for the sake of the seed, which is exported in large quantities to Behar. The various branches of the Ganges Canal afford abundant opportunities for irrigation, and the shallow ponds which collect after the rains are used by the villagers for the same purpose. In *parg\u00e1ns* Ras\u00fal\u00e1b\u00e1d and Shior\u00e1jpur a succession of swampy bottoms, the former bed of a considerable stream, runs in an irregular line across the country for about 25 miles; the water left in them after the rainy season is employed to irrigate the spring crops, while rice is grown in their moist basins after the surface has been thus partially drained.\n\nOf the District area of 2370 square miles, 1363\u00b79 square miles were returned as under cultivation in 1882\u201383, 353\u00b76 square miles as cultivable, and 642 square miles as cultivable waste; while 10 square miles were revenue-free or otherwise unassessed. The area under the different crops in 1882\u201383 (including land twice cropped) was thus distributed\u2014*kharif* 481,208 acres, and *rabi*, 453,885 acres. Of the *kharif* crop, *jo\u00e1r* occupied 191,987 acres; *bijra*, 33,077 acres; maize, 37,837 acres; cotton, 104,475 acres; sugar-cane, 6233 acres; and indigo, 59,100. Of the *rabi* crops, wheat took up 58,850 acres; wheat and barley, 32,811 acres; wheat and gram, 22,142; barley, 12,805 acres; barley and gram, 262,162 acres; and gram, 51,327.\n\nCawnpur District has always had a reputation for poverty. Densely populated, and with a large proportion of industrious Kachh\u00ed, Kurmi, and Lodh\u00e1 cultivators; having ample facilities for irrigation over at least two-thirds of its area, with free communication in every direction, there\nhas been little room left for increase of cultivation and enhanced prosperity since this part of Oudh passed under British rule. Some advance has undoubtedly been made within the last forty years, mainly through the enhanced prices for all kinds of agricultural produce.\n\nIn the northern pargan\u00e1s, jodr and wheat are grown in large proportions; while in the southern pargan\u00e1s, barely 2 per cent. of the area is under wheat, and bajra forms the staple crop. Rice is chiefly grown in Bilhaur, Ras\u00falab\u00e1d, and the southern part of Shior\u00e1jpur; while northern Shior\u00e1jpur is covered with indigo, small native factories studding the entire area north of the P\u00e1ndu. The sources of irrigation are the various distributaries of the Ganges Canal, wells, and in a less degree, ponds, lakes, and rivers. The total irrigated area in 1882\u201383 was 244,468 acres, 131,545 acres being watered from Government works, and 112,923 acres by private enterprise.\n\nThe average rates of rent in Cawnpur for cultivators with rights of occupancy are returned at 8s. 10\u00bdd. per acre for resident and 8s. 1\u00bdd. for non-resident cultivators. Resident tenants-at-will pay 9s. 4\u00bdd. an acre, and non-resident tenants-at-will, 7s. 8\u00bdd. per acre. Of the entire cultivated area, 61.7 per cent. is held by cultivators with occupancy rights, and 18.9 per cent. by tenants-at-will; while 10.6 per cent. is sir or home-farm land of the zam\u00ednd\u00e1rs, and the balance of 8.8 per cent. consists of revenue-free land, etc. The adult male agricultural population, excluding farm-labourers, numbered 221,923 in 1881, cultivating an average of 3.18 acres each. The total population, however, entirely dependent on the soil, is returned at 736,397, or 62.33 per cent. of the District population. Total Government land revenue, including local rates and cesses paid on land, \u00a3252,840, or an average of 5s. 10\u00bdd. per cultivated acre. Total amount of rent actually paid by the cultivators, including cesses, \u00a3376,964, or an average of 8s. 7\u00bdd. per cultivated acre. Cash rents are the rule. Occasionally a landlord sub-lets a portion of his homestead land (sir) on the metayer system. Newly-broken uplands, where the quality of the soil is a matter of doubt for the first year, are also generally held at first on a division of the produce. The agricultural stock of the District was returned as follows at the time of the settlement operations:\u2014Plough cattle and buffaloes, 218,295; cows, 171,275; draught cattle, 96,217; sheep, 29,820; goats, 78,890.\n\nIn 1882, the rates of wages were as follows:\u2014Coolies and unskilled labourers, 5\u00bdd. to 6\u00bdd. per diem; agricultural labourers, 4\u00bdd. to 5\u00bdd.; bricklayers and carpenters, 9d. to 1s. Women receive about one-fifth less than men, while children are paid from one-half to one-third of the wages of adults. The following were the average prices of food-stuffs in 1882:\u2014Wheat, 17\u00bd sers per rupee, or 6s. 4\u00bdd. per cwt.; rice, 15 sers per rupee, or 7s. 6d. per cwt.; jodr, 27\u00bd sers per rupee, or 4s. per cwt.; bajra, 25\u00bd sers per rupee, or 4s. 4\u00bdd. per cwt.\nNatural Calamities.\u2014Cawnpur suffers, like other Districts of the Do\u00e1b, from drought and its natural consequence, famine. It is not so severely visited in this respect as the country farther to the west; but neither, on the other hand, does it share the comparative immunity of the region immediately eastward. It was the most westerly of all the Districts which experienced the terrible famine of 1770. In 1783-84, both autumn and spring crops failed, and the people and cattle died by thousands. The distress was worst beyond the Jumna, and the starving hordes of Bundelkhand crossed the river into Cawnpur only to die on their arrival. The next great drought was that of 1803-4, when most of the kharif crops and the whole rabi harvest perished for want of rain. The famine of 1837 visited Cawnpur with frightful severity. During July, August, and September no rain fell, and not a blade of vegetation was produced; the cattle died in herds, and whole villages were depopulated. The pargan\u00e1s along the Ganges suffered most; and though revenue was remitted, and relief works were started, immense tracts of arable land fell out of cultivation, as neither men nor cattle were left to till them. A little of the autumn crops escaped along the Jumna, and a few patches were cultivated for the spring harvest by means of irrigation. In 1860-61, the distress was worst in the Upper Do\u00e1b and Rohilkhand, but did not reach so far east as Cawnpur in its full intensity. The scarcity was quite sufficient, however, to put pressure on the lower classes, and crimes against property became much more frequent than usual. In 1868-69, 1873-74, and 1878, Cawnpur escaped almost unhurt; and it is hoped that the existing means of communication, combined with the grand opportunities for irrigation afforded by the Ganges Canal, will suffice to protect it in future from the worst extremity of famine.\n\nCommerce and Trade, etc.\u2014The District as a whole has a considerable agricultural trade in raw materials, especially grain, cotton, and indigo-seed. In the city of Cawnpur, saddlery, boots, and other leathern articles are manufactured in large quantities. The Elgin and Muir Cotton Mills, under European supervision, afford employment to a great number of hands, and supply the native weavers with yarn for their looms. Leather goods, textile fabrics, and tents are largely exported. There is a large Government tannery and leather manufactory in the old fort, for the supply of accoutrements for the army. Government flour mills grind corn for commissariat purposes. For many years past, Cawnpur showed a tendency to increase its business, to the detriment of other local markets, such as Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d. It has long been the principal entrep\u00f4t for commerce arriving from Oudh, Rohilkhand, the remoter Do\u00e1b villages, and Bundelkhand. Quite lately, however, symptoms of a reactionary tendency have been observed, owing doubtless to the extension of the railway system, which favours the develop-\nment of local centres and the general diffusion of commerce. The bankers and large traders of Cawnpur are chiefly Baniy\u00e1s and R\u00e1jputs. They have correspondents at Calcutta, Patna, Benares, Mirz\u00e1pur, Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d, Agra, and H\u00e1thras; and they act in turn as agents for firms at those places. The means of communication are ample. The East Indian Railway passes through the whole length of the District, with five stations within its boundaries. The Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway sends its Cawnpur branch across the river Ganges by a girder bridge, and has a station at the town. The Grand Trunk Road also traverses the District, parallel to the Ganges, with a length of 64 miles; it conveys most of the local heavy traffic. There are other metalled roads to K\u00e1lpi and to Ham\u00edrpur (crossing the Jumna by pontoon bridges); while unmetalled roads, raised and bridged throughout, connect all the minor local centres. A great deal of country produce, such as grain, indigo-seed, wood, and hides, is still conveyed by water along the Ganges and the Jumna.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The ordinary staff of the District consists of a Collector-Magistrate, two Joint Magistrates, an Assistant, and two Deputies. In 1876, the whole amount of revenue\u2014imperial, municipal, and local\u2014raised in the District amounted to \u00a3303,361; while in 1880\u201381 the gross revenue amounted to \u00a3390,286, of which \u00a3214,924 was derived from the land-tax. In 1881 the strength of the regular District police force consisted of 552 officers and men, and the cantonment and town police, of 428 of all ranks, maintained at a cost of \u00a310,372, of which \u00a37,480 is contributed from the provincial revenue. These figures show one policeman to every 2'39 square miles and every 1171 of the population; with an expenditure at the rate of \u00a34, 14s. per square mile, and 2\u00bdd. per inhabitant. The regular police was supplemented by a body of 2852 chaukid\u00e1rs or village watchmen, maintained by the landholders or villagers, or one to every 414 of the population. The District jail contained in 1880\u201381 a daily average of 382 prisoners, of whom 348 were males and 34 females. There are 29 imperial and 4 local post-offices in the District. The Government has a telegraph-office at Cawnpur, and the East Indian Railway telegraph-offices at all its stations. Education was carried on in 1881 by means of 234 schools under State inspection, maintained or assisted by Government, with a total of 7082 pupils on 31st March. The total cost of these schools in 1880\u201381 amounted to \u00a35537, of which \u00a31892 was paid from the provincial revenue, the remainder being derived from endowments, grants, fees, etc. The above figures do not include private uninspected schools, for which returns are not available. The Census of 1881, however, returned a total of 11,035 boys at school, out of a total male population of 628,891, or one in 56; and 278 girls at school out of a total female population of 552,505, or one in 1987. For fiscal\npurposes Cawnpur is sub-divided into 9 tahsils and 90 pargan\u00e1s. The District contains only one municipality\u2014Cawnpur city (q.v.).\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate of Cawnpur is like that of the other Do\u00e1b Districts. From the middle of April to the 1st of July it is excessively hot and dry, and westerly winds prevail. After this, the monsoon is ushered in by damp east winds. The rainy season lasts till the end of September or beginning of October; the cold weather commences about the 1st of November. The District is on the whole well drained, and is therefore fairly healthy during the rains. The average annual rainfall for the 30 years ending 1880 was 29'23 inches. During this period, the maximum was 48'7 inches in 1867, and the minimum was 11'0 inches in 1860. The rainfall in 1880 was 22'13 inches, or 7'13 inches below the average. The total number of deaths reported in 1881 was 48,978, or 41 per thousand of the population; the average death-rate per thousand during the previous six years was 36'90.\n\nThere are 7 dispensaries in the District\u2014at Cawnpur, Naw\u00e1bganj, Generalganj, Bhognipur, Gh\u00e1tampur, Der\u00e1pur, and Bithur; the first three being in the city and station. During the year 1881, 34,547 persons were treated in these institutions, of whom 993 were in-door patients and 33,554 out-door. [For further information regarding Cawnpur, see the Gazetteer of the North-Western Provinces, vol. vi. pp. 1 to 269 (Government Press, Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d, 1881). Also the Settlement Report of Cawnpur, by J. N. Wright, Esq., C.S. (1878); the Census Report of 1881 for the North-Western Provinces; and the Administration Reports of the Provinces from 1880 to 1883.]\n\nCawnpur City.\u2014Administrative head-quarters of Cawnpur District, North-Western Provinces, lying on the right bank of the river Ganges, 130 miles above its junction with the Jumna at Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d. Lat. 26\u00b0 28' 15\" N., and long. 80\u00b0 23' 45\" E. Distant from Calcutta 628 miles north-west, from Delhi 266 miles south-east. Cawnpur is the fourth city in size and importance of the North-Western Provinces and Oudh; including the native city, cantonments, and civil station, it covers an area of 6015 acres, and has a population, according to the Census of 1881, of 151,444 souls. Elevation above sea-level, about 500 feet.\n\nSituation and Appearance.\u2014The cantonments and civil station of Cawnpur lie along the right bank of the Ganges, while the native city stretches inland toward the south-west, and also fills up the space between the military and civil portions of the European quarter. Starting from the east, on the Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d road, the race-course first meets the eye of the approaching visitor. The Native Cavalry Lines succeed to the westward, after which comes the brigade parade ground. North-east of the latter lie the European Infantry barracks and St. John's Church; while the intervening ground, between these cantonments and\nthe river bank, is occupied by the Memorial Church, built on the site of Wheeler's entrenchments in 1857, the club, the artillery lines, and the various military offices. The city covers the plain north of the parade ground; and the Ganges shore is here lined by the Memorial Gardens, enclosing the famous well. The gardens cover nearly 50 acres, and are prettily laid out. Over the fatal well, a mound has been raised, which slopes upwards until it is crowned by a handsome octagonal Gothic wall, with iron gates. In the centre of the enclosure is the figure of an angel in white marble by Marochetti, with arms crossed on her breast, each hand holding a palm branch. Over the archway of the gate is inscribed: 'These are they which came out of great tribulation;' and around the wall which marks the circle of the well: 'Sacred to the perpetual memory of a great company of Christian people, chiefly women and children, who near this spot were cruelly murdered by the followers of the rebel N\u00e1n\u00e1 Dhundu Panth of Bithur, and cast, the dying with the dead, into the well below, on the xvth day of July MDCCCLVII.' The expense of the construction of the gardens and memorial was defrayed partly out of a fine levied on the city after the suppression of the rebellion. A Government grant of \u00a3500 a year is made for the maintenance of the gardens, which is irrigated from the Ganges Canal. In the gardens, south and south-west of the well, are two graveyards with monuments to those who were massacred or died at Cawnpur during the Mutiny. Farther to the west stands the civil station, with the Bank of Bengal, Christ Church, the theatre, and other European buildings. Old Cawnpur lies three miles farther along the river-side, separated from the present city by fields and gardens. The modern origin of Cawnpur deprives it of architectural attractions; and it cannot boast of such ancient palaces or handsome mansions as adorn Agra, Benares, and other historic capitals. The few buildings with any pretensions to beauty or elegance have been erected during the last fifty years by bankers, merchants, or pleaders. The native city was built according to no plan, and is badly laid out, abounding in narrow streets and passages. Except on the undulating margin of the Ganges, or where indented by ravines, the sites of the city, cantonment and civil station, are alike flat and uninteresting. The principal landing-place on the Ganges is that known as the Sarsiya gh\u00e1t, a noble flight of steps, surrounded by a vaulted arcade of brick and stone. Cawnpur also contains, besides the buildings mentioned above, two Roman Catholic chapels, a Union Church, a fine market-place, high school, club, and two racquet courts, etc.\n\nHistory. \u2014 Cawnpur possesses no historic interest in early times, being a purely modern creation to meet the military and administrative needs of the British Government. The city first arose after the defeats of Shuj\u00e1-ud-daul\u00e1, Naw\u00e1b Waz\u00edr of Oudh, at Buxar, in October 1764,\nand at Kora in May 1765. The Naw\u00e1b then concluded a treaty with the British, granting them the right of stationing troops at two places in his dominions, Cawnpur and Fatehgarh. One of the detachments, however, was at first quartered at Bilgr\u00e1m; and it was not till 1778 that the present site became the advanced frontier post in this portion of the newly-acquired territory. From the location of a large body of troops in Cawnpur, the town sprang rapidly into importance as a trading mart, and has now developed into a commercial city of the first rank. In 1801, the surrounding country came finally under British rule, by cession from the Naw\u00e1b Wazir, and the head-quarters of a District were fixed in the city. No events of historical note occurred between the annexation and the Mutiny of 1857; but in that year Cawnpur was rendered memorable by the leading part which it played in the operations of the mutineers. The struggle with the rebels lasted from May to December; but the station itself was never lost for more than a few days.\n\nNews of the outbreak of the troops at Meerut reached Cawnpur on the 14th of May. Eleven days later, the N\u00e1n\u00e1 Dundhu Panth of Bithur, adopted son of the last Peshw\u00e1, B\u00e1ji R\u00e1o, was placed in charge of the treasury; and, on the 30th of May, the entrenchment of the European barracks began. On the 6th of June, the native troops mutinied, sacked the treasury, broke open the jail, and burnt the public offices. Next day, the N\u00e1n\u00e1 opened fire on the entrenchments, which had no other fortification than a mud parapet, 5 feet in height. After three weeks' cannonade, the position became untenable, and the garrison capitulated under a promise of personal security and safe conduct to Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d. On the 27th they embarked in boats on the Ganges for Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d, at the S\u00e1ti Chaura gh\u00e1t, a landing-place near the spot where the Memorial Gardens now stand. Before they could put off, they were treacherously fired upon from the bank, and all destroyed or captured, except one boat-load, which escaped for the time into Fatehpur District. The prisoners, including women and children, were crowded into a house at Cawnpur, and finally massacred by the N\u00e1n\u00e1's orders, in the Sav\u00e1da Kothi, near the East Indian Railway, and their bodies cast into the now historic well, noticed above. On the 16th of July, Havelock's small force entered the city, and the N\u00e1n\u00e1 fled precipitately to Bithur.\n\nFour days later, General Neill arrived with an ample reinforcement of 400 Europeans. Havelock thrice advanced unsuccessfully into Oudh, and retreated at last to Cawnpur, on the 10th of August. Shortly afterwards, General Outram reached the city, and marched on to the relief of Lucknow, which was successfully accomplished on the 25th. Lord Clyde's and Col. Greathed's columns passed through on different occasions in October; and on the 26th of November, the\nGwalior mutineers approached Cawnpur. General Windham attacked and defeated the rebel force; but, being strengthened by Oudh insurgents, they again assaulted the city, which they wrested from us on the 27th. They held it, however, only for a single night, as Lord Clyde's army marched in on the evening of the 28th, drove out the mutineers, and utterly defeated them next day, outside the city, with the loss of all their guns. After the re-organization of the District, the site of the massacre was laid out as Memorial Gardens, and an ornamental building was placed over the well into which the bodies were flung. The surrounding wall is pierced with rows of lancet windows or openings, having trefoiled mullions; and handsome bronze doors close the entrance. Within stands the marble angel of Marochetti, already described. This forms the chief object of interest to visitors in a city otherwise devoid of historical interest. A Memorial Church also occupies the site of General Wheeler's entrenchments in the cantonment. The style is Romanesque, and the material consists of massive red brick, relieved by buttresses and copings of buff freestone.\n\n**Population.**\u2014The Census of 1881 returned the population of Cawnpur city and civil station at 120,161 souls; namely, 90,922 Hindus, 28,359 Muhammadans, 111 Jains, and 769 Christians or 'others.' The cantonments contained a population of 31,283, made up of 22,432 Hindus, 6,378 Muhammadans, 3 Jains, and 2,470 Christians and 'others.' Grand total, 151,444, namely, Hindus, 113,354; Muhammadans, 34,737; Jains, 114; Christians, 3194; and 'others,' 45.\n\n**Communications, Trade, etc.**\u2014The Ganges forms the natural waterway for the traffic of Cawnpur, and still carries a large portion of the heavy trade. The Ganges canal, which passes just south of the city, is also navigable, and affords means of communication for a considerable number of country boats. The East Indian Railway from Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d to Delhi has a station about a mile west of the city; and the Lucknow branch of the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway, after crossing the Ganges by a girder bridge, passes between the native quarter and the cantonments and joins the East Indian line a little west of the Cawnpur station. The Grand Trunk Road from Calcutta to Delhi also runs through the city and military lines; while other roads branch off southward to K\u00e1lpi and Ham\u00edrpur, and northward over the railway bridge, to Unao and Lucknow.\n\nThe chief industry of Cawnpur consists in the manufacture of leather goods, which is rapidly developing from year to year. A large Government tannery and leather manufactory is situated in the old fort, together with a steam flour mill. Two large steam cotton mills give employment to a considerable number of operatives, who manufacture yarn, cloth, and tents, and supply the native weavers with material for their craft; and several cotton presses, both European and native. These two items\nof leather and cotton goods make up the principal export trade of Cawnpur; but the city also forms a great grain mart where agricultural produce from Bundelkhand, Oudh, and the middle Do\u00e1b is collected for despatch by rail. The commerce of Cawnpur has steadily increased for many years past, somewhat to the detriment of Fatehgarh, Mirzapur, and other local trading centres; but the development of the railway system in Upper India is already acting so as to decentralize the trade, by creating intermediate marts.\n\nThree weekly vernacular newspapers are published in the town, which also contains two English and about six vernacular printing-presses. Municipal income in 1882\u201383, \u00a315,160, of which \u00a39103 was derived from taxation; average incidence of taxation, 1s. 6d. per head of population within municipal limits (117,030). The cantonment is not included within municipal limits. The troops ordinarily stationed in the cantonment consist of one European and one native regiment of infantry, a regiment of native cavalry, and a battery of royal artillery.\n\n**Ceded Districts.**\u2014A term applied to the territory in the Deccan ceded to the British in 1800, after the downfall of Tip\u00fa Sult\u00e1n, for the maintenance of the Niz\u00e1m's Subsidiary Force. In the Madras Presidency, the Districts of North Arcot, Kurnool, Bellary, and Cuddapah are known as the Ceded Districts.\u2014See HYDERABAD STATE.\n\n**Ceded and Conquered Provinces.**\u2014A term formerly applied to the Provinces ceded by the Naw\u00e1b Wazir of Oudh in 1801, including Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d, Azamgarh, Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d, Et\u00e1wah, Gorakhpur, etc., with a total revenue of Sicca rupees 13,523,474 (see Aitchison's Treaties, vol. ii. pp. 100\u2013103, ed. 1876). They formed the nucleus of the North-Western Provinces, and still constitute the eastern portion of that Lieutenant-Governorship.\n\n**Central India.**\u2014This is the term now officially applied to the territories included in the nine Political Agencies under the ultimate supervision of the Agent to the Governor-General for Central India, who resides at Indore, and who is in direct correspondence with the Supreme Government. These are the Indore, the Bhil or Bhopawar, the Deputy Bhil, the Western Malwa, the Bhopal, the Gwalior, the Guna, the Bundelkhand, and the Baghelkhand Agencies, all being included and collectively designated as the 'Central India Agency.' The whole tract in which these Agencies are included lies to the north of the Central Provinces, having the North-Western Provinces on the north-east, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na on the north-west, the Bombay District of Kh\u00e1ndesh and Rew\u00e1 K\u00e1ntha on the west and south-west, and the Garhj\u00e1t State of Chang-Bakh\u00e1r of Chutia-N\u00e1gpur in Bengal on the east. The states of the Central India Agency, comprised in this tract of country, cover an area of about\n75,000 square miles, with a population (1881) of 9,261,907 souls. The whole tract has been roughly described as a great triangle with the Narbad\u00e1 (Nerbudda) and Son (Soane) for its hypotenuse, and having for one side the valley of the Ganges, and for the other the river Chambal and the Chittor hills. It lies between $21^\\circ 24'$ and $26^\\circ 52'$ N. lat., and between $74^\\circ 0'$ and $83^\\circ 0'$ E. long. The British Districts of Jh\u00e1nsi and Lalitpur, of the North-Western Provinces, divide this Agency into two main divisions \u2014 Native Bundelkhand and B\u00e1ghelkhand, lying to the east, and Central India proper to the west.\n\nThe following are the States included within the whole area, each of which see separately: \u2014 Indore, Dew\u00e1s, B\u00e1gli, and 15 guaranteed Th\u00e1kurates under the Indore Agency; Dh\u00e1r, Jhabua, Ali-R\u00e1jpur, Jobat, and 13 guaranteed Th\u00e1kurates under the Bhil or Bhop\u00e1war Agency; the British parsan\u00e1 of M\u00e1npur, Barw\u00e1n\u00ed, and 10 guaranteed Th\u00e1kurates under the Deputy-Bhil Agency; Jaora, Ratl\u00e1m, Sit\u00e1mau, S\u00e1l\u00edna, and 17 guaranteed Th\u00e1kurates under the Western M\u00e1lw\u00e1 Agency; Bhop\u00e1l, R\u00e1jgarh, Narsinghgarh, Khilchipur, Kurwai, Maks\u00fadangarh, Muhammadgarh, Path\u00e1ri, Basoda, and 17 guaranteed Th\u00e1kurates under the Bhop\u00e1l Agency; Gwalior, and 15 minor chiefs under the Gwalior Agency and the G\u00fana Sub-Agency of Gwalior; Orchha or Tehr\u00ed Datia, Sampthar, Panna, Charkh\u00e1ri, Ajaigarh, Bij\u00e1war, Chhatarpur, Baoni, Alipura, Bironda, Jaso, Kalinjar, Gaurih\u00e1r, Khania-Dh\u00e1na, and 17 other petty chiefs under the Bundelkhand Agency; Rew\u00e1, Nagode, Maihar, Soh\u00e1wal, Koti, Sidpura, and Raigi\u00f3n under the B\u00e1ghelkhand Agency.\n\nThe Bundelkhand and B\u00e1ghelkhand portion, or the eastern part of the great triangular plateau of Central India, is watered by the rivers Dhasan and Ken flowing into the Jumna, and on the east by the Son flowing into the Ganges, the Khaim\u00far range of hills\u2014a continuation of the Vindhyas\u2014rising up along its left bank. The Panna range, with deep ravines and isolated crags on its north-western face, traverses this Division of Central India, and there is a broken plateau between the Panna and Khaim\u00far ridges watered by the Tons, a tributary of the Ganges. To the north, the Bundelkhand division terminates in an amphitheatre of precipices shaping the country below into a bay bounded by sandstone cliffs.\n\nThe larger or Central India division has the great range of the Vindhyas along the whole south, abruptly overhanging the valley of the Narbad\u00e1 (Nerbudda) and presenting the appearance of a weather-beaten coast-line. From its summits, varying in height from 1500 to 2500 feet, the northern slope to the Jumna commences, the whole region consisting of a broken but elevated country, with ranges of hills, watered by the river Chambal, with its tributaries the Kali-S\u00ednd and Parbati, and by the S\u00ednd and Betwa, all flowing into the Jumna, and descending from the high table-lands in cascades of great height.\nThe mineral resources of the whole country are considerable\u2014iron, coal, copper, and limestone abound; and in the Bundelkhand portion, about 12 or 15 miles north-east of the town of Panna, the capital of the State of that name, is an adamantiferous tract from which diamonds are extracted of the value of several thousand pounds sterling a year. The mines are less prosperous now than formerly; but it is believed that inexhaustible diamond-producing strata exist in this locality, and that, if the mines were properly worked, their productiveness would be found not to have diminished. Most of the territory included under the Central India Agency is well cultivated and fertile, and the whole of the M\u00e1lw\u00e1 plateau most fertile, producing in abundance and excellence, wheat, rice, and other grains and pulses, sugar-cane, cotton, and especially opium. Tobacco is also much cultivated, and is of excellent quality.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The population of the States under the Central India Agency is of a widely diverse character, comprising besides Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s (the ruling class), R\u00e1jputs, Bundel\u00e1s, B\u00e1ghel\u00e1s, J\u00e1ts, Kol\u00eds, and a number of aboriginal tribes, the most numerous being the Gonds and the uncivilised Bhils. The Census of 1881 was the first systematic attempt that has been made to enumerate the population of these States, all previous returns being mere estimates. The results disclosed a total population of 9,261,907 persons, spread over an area of 75,229 square miles, containing 53 towns and 31,465 villages, and inhabiting 1,680,394 houses; average density of population, 123\u00b712 per square mile; persons per town or village, 294; persons per occupied house, 5\u00b75. The population is almost entirely Hindu, no less than 7,800,396 being returned as belonging to this religion, while only 510,718 are Muhammadans. Jains number 49,824; P\u00e1rs\u00eds, 916; Christians, 7065, principally in the British cantonments; Sikhs, 1455; Jews, 38; aborigines, 891,424; and \u2018others,\u2019 71. Br\u00e1hmans number 961,993, and are the most numerous caste, except the despised Cham\u00e1rs, in the Central India States. R\u00e1jputs are returned at 803,366. Other principal Hindu castes\u2014Cham\u00e1rs, 1,076,949; Guj\u00e1rs, 337,466; Ah\u00edrs, 246,376; Baniy\u00e1s, 286,678; Tel\u00eds, 250,252; Bal\u00e1\u00eds, 170,392; Kachhis, 183,064; and K\u00fanbis, 168,148. The aboriginal tribes constitute 9 per cent. of the population of the Central India States. The Gonds number 413,602, and live in the Gondw\u00e1n\u00e1 tract. Next in importance come the Bhils, who are returned at 217,022. They inhabit the States on the south-west corner, and are not found elsewhere in Central India. Formerly a tribe which lived by plunder, they are now gradually settling down as peaceful agriculturists. Kols, who number 187,315, are aborigines of the hilly country around Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur, and are only found in Panna among the Central India States.\n\nClimate.\u2014The northern part of Central India has a climate partaking of the torrid character of the neighbouring tracts of the North-\nWestern Provinces and R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. In these parts, the climate during the rainy season, and for a short time after, is exceedingly unhealthy, fevers being then rife in consequence of the moisture imbibed by the superficial alluvial soil being prevented from passing off by an impenetrable substratum of sandstone. During the dry and hot seasons, the climate is not unhealthy. The middle, the southern, and the western parts, or those occupied within the M\u00e1lw\u00e1 tract, with little exception, have a mild and rather equable climate, resulting from the greater elevation of the surface. The cool season comprises the period from November to February; the hot season succeeds and continues to the middle of June, when the periodical rains set in and last to the close of September, the average fall being about 50 inches. During the rains the thermometer has a moderate range, rarely more than from $72^\\circ$ to $80^\\circ$ F.; in the winter it sometimes falls three or four degrees below freezing-point. During the sultry season the hot winds are comparatively mild, and of short duration, though the thermometer sometimes rises to nearly $100^\\circ$ during the day, but the nights are for the most part cool and refreshing.\n\nA trunk road from Gwalior to Bombay, via Indore, runs through the whole length of the Central India division of the territory, while good roads connect the capitals of the various states throughout the whole tract with each other and with the neighbouring large towns in British territory. The \u2018R\u00e1jput\u00e1na-M\u00e1lw\u00e1 Railway,\u2019 from Ajmere, connects with the Great Indian Peninsula Railway at Khandwa station, passing through the territory on the west via Neemuch, Ratlam, Indore, and Mhow (Mau), a small branch of the line connecting with Ujjain. The Bhop\u00e1l State Railway, branching off from It\u00e1rsi station of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, runs to Bhop\u00e1l, while the Sindhia State Railway has been completed between Agra and Gwalior via Dholpur, the surveys for an extension of the line via Jhansi and Lalitpur to Bhop\u00e1l being in progress. The Jabalpur (Jubbulpore) extension line of the East Indian Railway from Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d to Jabalpur runs through the Bundelkhand portion of the country.\n\nThe highest representative of the Paramount Power in Central India is the Agent to the Governor-General of India, who resides at Indore. His authority is the unifying principle that pervades the administration of the many states of Central India committed to his care. He is the friend and counsellor of all the ruling chiefs; he is the guardian of chiefs during their minority; and he is the medium of communication between the Imperial Government and the native Darb\u00e1rs. He is, moreover, a minister of war for Central India, having large bodies of troops at his disposal. He exercises the functions of a High Court of Judicature, original and appellate, within the limits of the Residencies and Cantonments. He exercises a supervision over the opium-tax,\nwith the designation of Opium Agent; over the payment of tribute, relief, and other feudal charges to which the protected states are liable; and over the various political officers superintending the several agencies named above.\n\n**Central India Agency.**\u2014The collective name given to the nine Political Agencies under the Agent to the Governor-General for Central India.\u2014See **Central India**.\n\n**Central Provinces.**\u2014The name given to the territory under the administration of a Chief Commissioner, lying between $17^\\circ 50'$ and $24^\\circ 27'$ N. lat., and between $76^\\circ$ and $85^\\circ 15'$ E. long. The Chief-Commissionership extends from Bundelkhand in the north to the Madras Presidency in the south, and from the frontier of Bengal in the east to Independent M\u00e1lw\u00e1 and the Deccan in the west, with an extreme length from north to south of 500 miles, and from east to west of 600 miles. Of the ancient geographical divisions of India, the Central Provinces comprise nearly the whole of Gondw\u00e1n\u00e1, and parts of Hindust\u00e1n and M\u00e1lw\u00e1. Population in 1881, 11,548,511; area, 113,279 square miles.\n\n**Physical Aspects.**\u2014The tract falls naturally into several distinct areas, marked out by their physical features, and in a great measure by geological structure. To the north extends the Vindhyan table-land (including the Districts of S\u00e1gar (Saugor) and Damoh), which sheds its waters northwards into the valley of the Ganges. Throughout this region, the surface is formed by the deposits styled \u2018Vindhyan,\u2019 except in the large tracts where the Vindhyan strata are concealed by the overflowing volcanic rocks of the great Deccan trap area. South of S\u00e1gar (Saugor) and Damoh, in the valley of the Narbad\u00e1 (Nerbudda), come Mandla (which includes the upper course of the river before it debouches into the plains), Jabalpur (Jubbulpore), Narsinghpur, Hoshangabad, and a part of Nimar, the rest of which lies in the valley of the T\u00e1pt\u00ed. This area chiefly consists of alluvial and tertiary deposits, with a narrow belt of older rocks along the southern side of the valley. Continuing southwards, the next cluster of Districts comprises Betul, Chhindwara, Seoni, and Balaghat, which occupy the extensive highlands constituting the S\u00e1tpura table-land, in great part formed of the Deccan traps resting upon crystalline rocks, or upon sandstone and other rocks of later date. These Districts at their central plateaux attain a height of about 2000 feet. Still farther to the south extends the great N\u00e1gpur plain, formed by the valleys of the Wardh\u00e1 and W\u00e1ingang\u00e1, which comprises the Districts of Nagpur, Wardha, Bhandara, and Chanda. This region has no great elevation. It rests principally on gneissose and trap rocks, the former predominating in N\u00e1gpur and Bhandar\u00e1, the latter in Wardh\u00e1, eastwards. Below the gh\u00e1ts lies the Chhat\u00edsgarh plain, a low expanse of red\nsoil, containing the Districts of Raipur and Bilaspur. In this division is also included the District of Sambalpur, a rugged and jungly country, composed of crystalline and metamorphic rocks. Sambalpur is not, however, part of Chhat\u00edsgarh proper, either geographically or historically. It was originally attached to the South-Western Frontier Agency of Bengal, and lies principally in the valley of the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed. Last of all, to the extreme south, almost cut off by forests and wild semi-independent States, is a strip of territory, of varied geological structure, stretching along the left bank of the God\u00e1var\u00ed, and attached to Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 District.\n\nThe hill plateau is thus succeeded by a lowland plain, and again a larger and loftier plateau by a larger plain, ending in a mass of hill and forest, which is probably the wildest part of the whole Indian peninsula. But even the comparatively level portions of this area are broken by isolated peaks and straggling hill ranges; and nowhere in India are the changes of soil and vegetation more rapid and marked than in the Narbad\u00e1 (Nerbudda) country. 'There,' writes Mr. Charles Grant, 'in the pleasant winter months, the eye may range over miles of green cornlands, broken only by low black boundary ridges or dark twisting footpaths. The horizon is bounded here and there by hill ranges, which seem to rise abruptly from the plain; but on approaching them, the heavy green of their slopes is found to be divided from the softer hues of the young wheat by broad belts of gravelly soil,\u2014here carpeted with short sward and dotted with noble trees, there uncovered, and contrasting their brown-red tints with the deep black of the valley lands. But the greenness of English scenery is wanting. It is only in favoured reaches of the rivers, where the pools never dry up, that the water-loving shrubs keep their verdure and brilliancy throughout the year.'\n\nOn the S\u00e1tpuras, the grander alternations of scenery are even more frequent. 'The hills are higher and more abrupt, the black-soil deposits deeper, and the water-supply more abundant. In the midst of the grim rolling plateaux of basalt lurk little valleys cultivated like gardens,\u2014oases of sugar-cane and opium,\u2014which, but for their inaccessibility, would tempt away the best cultivators of the plains.' The rivers, with their rapid streams and limpid waters, lend a singular charm to the Province. Such is the sacred Narbada, as it dashes through the glens, and leaps in wild waterfalls from the heights of Amarkantak, its bright waters glistening against the black basaltic rock, or as it winds along the narrow channel between the glittering 'Marble Rocks,' or works itself into the whirlpool of Makr\u00e1i; and such are the Wardha and Wainganga, foaming, after the rains, in torrents along their deep and rocky beds; and the God\u00e1var\u00ed, where it forces a passage through the heart of the mountains which formerly marked the\nfrontier of the Province. At this point the God\u00e1var\u00ed may justly claim the title of the Indian Rhine. Pent in for 20 miles between the hills, the river flows in a deep and narrow channel, with a fierce current that sometimes lashes itself into boiling whirlpools, till, escaping from its prison, it spreads itself in a broad smooth surface, and, flowing on in a mighty stream, leaves the Central Provinces behind. To the east, in Bhand\u00e1r\u00e1 and parts of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 District, lies the lake country of the Province.\n\n'There,' says Sir R. Temple, 'an irrigation tank is not a piece of water with regular banks, crowned with rows or avenues of trees, with an artificial dyke and sluices, and with fields around it, but it is an irregular expanse of water; its banks are formed by rugged hills, covered with low forests that fringe the margins where the wild beasts repair to drink; its dykes, mainly shaped out of spurs from the hills, are thrown athwart the hollows, a part only being formed by masonry; its sluices often consist of chasms or fissures in the rock; its broad surface is often, as the monsoon approaches, lashed into surging and crested waves.' Nawagaon, the largest of these lakes, is 17 miles in circumference, with a depth in places of 90 feet. Nor have the Hindus failed to appreciate the beauties of the country. Wherever, as at Bh\u00e9r\u00e1gh\u00e1t, a splendid view unfolds itself; wherever, as at Muktagiri, the plash of a waterfall echoes through the trees,\u2014there in all likelihood rises an ancient temple. The spirit of the old nature-worship yet lives in the legends that consecrate these lovely scenes.\n\nForests.\u2014The Central Provinces cover an area of 113,279 square miles, of which little more than one-third is under cultivation. Yet the forests are not so important as might have been expected. The greater part of the waste land is covered by scrub jungle, and produces but little valuable timber. Nature may have doomed the stony highlands to barrenness, but the improvidence of man has desolated many of the fertile tracts. Each most valuable tree has had its special enemy. The teak fell before the ravages of the charcoal-burner, who found that its close-grained wood produced the most concentrated fuel. The s\u00e1l (Shorea robusta), when tapped, supplies an excellent resin; and many a noble tree has consequently been girdled and left to perish. But still more destructive has proved the habit of d\u0101hya or nomad cultivation, now fortunately on the wane, by means of which clearances are made by firing the forest and jungle. At present, the northern part of the Province is almost destitute of tree forests. In the south, amid the scanty population in the hill chiefships which border the N\u00e1gpur and Chhatisgarh plains, the forests have suffered least. Under the system of conservancy introduced in 1860, considerable progress has been made in arresting the course of destruction. The woodland is divided into reserved forests, under the special control and\nmanagement of the Forest Department, with an aggregate area in 1882-83 of 2588 square miles; and 17,131 square miles of unreserved or excess wastes, which, at the Settlement, Government retained for itself. These latter are managed by the District officers. Experience shows that wherever fire is kept out of the forests, the power of natural reproduction may be relied upon. In 1882-83, an attempt was made to protect 912,927 acres; and actual protection from fire was afforded to 889,968 acres. The total cost amounted to \u00a31557, the average being \u00a31, 2s. 6d. per square mile.\n\nCoal.\u2014The large coal-fields which extend under various parts of the Central Provinces, and the excellence of the iron-ores, gave rise to expectations which at present seem unlikely to be realized. For the most part, on analysis, the coal has proved of inferior quality. It contains neither sufficient fixed carbon for iron-smelting, nor combustible volatile gases to such an amount as to adapt it for generating steam. At present the only important colliery is that at Waror\u00e1, which turned out 88,417 tons of fair quality in 1882. Production of coal has largely increased of late years in consequence of the consumption of this coal by the Great Indian Peninsula Railway Company.\n\nIron.\u2014The Central Provinces is also rich in its iron-ores, particularly in Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 District, and a scientific examination into the resources of this District was conducted in 1881-82 by Ritter von Schwarz, a gentleman of great experience in iron-mining in Austria, and his report promises favourably for the future. He considered that with the construction of an ironwork at Dung\u00e1rpur, and the erection of more blast furnaces, there was no reason to doubt that Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 District alone was capable of turning out 260,000 tons of iron or steel yearly. He reported further that, besides supplying India with much of her steel and iron requirements, Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 was able to open out an export trade with England in articles which were now imported from the Continent, particularly in Ferro-manganese and Brescian steel.\n\nHistory.\u2014The early history of the Province consists entirely of the conjectural interpretation of fragmentary inscriptions, which record the names of unknown princes, and relate their deeds with oriental hyperbole. We learn how their beneficence made earth better than heaven, how the world trembled at the march of their elephants, and how the sea was swollen by the tears of queens widowed by their conquests. But from this source little positive knowledge can be obtained. It seems established that in the 5th century a race of foreign (Yavana) origin ruled from the S\u00e1tpura plateau. Again, between the 10th and 13th centuries, we can discern a distinguished line of Lunar R\u00e1jput princes governing the country round Jabalpur (Jubbulpore), while a territory south of the S\u00e1tpuras was held by the fire-descended Pram\u00e1ra princes of M\u00e1lw\u00e1. The Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 dynasty of Gonds probably\nrose to power as early as the 10th or 11th century; and the Haihai-Bans\u00ed kings of Chhat\u00edsgarh trace their origin to the remotest antiquity.\n\nBefore, however, we leave this dim and misty borderland, and pass into the realms of history, we are confronted by a problem which deserves some notice. Who were the Gaulis? Were the historical Gond kingdoms preceded by a race of shepherd kings? On the S\u00e1tpura plateau, in Nim\u00e1r and S\u00e1g\u00e1r (Saugor) Districts, and in parts of the N\u00e1gpur Division, every ruin of an unknown age, every legend that cannot be traced to Hindu mythology, is assigned to the Gauli princes. Of these shadowy personages the most striking is As\u00e1, the Ah\u00edr chief, whose story Ferishta relates. Towards the close of the 14th century, there dwelt on the summit of a lofty hill in Kh\u00e1ndesh a rich herdsman chief, whose ancestors had held their estates for 700 years. He had ten thousand cattle, twenty thousand sheep, and a thousand mares. His followers numbered two thousand, and he had built himself a strong fortress. But the people, to whom his benevolence had endeared him, still called him by the familiar name of As\u00e1 the Ah\u00edr (herdsman), and thus his fort has received the name of As\u00edg\u00e1rh. It is, however, with regard to Deogarh that the Gauli traditions gather most consistence. Deogarh was, it is said, the last seat of Gauli power; and the names yet survive of the successive chiefs, until J\u00e1tb\u00e1, the favourite and minister of Mans\u00far and Gans\u00far, the two last Gauli princes, murdered his benefactors, and founded the Gond dynasty of Deogarh.\n\nBut whatever importance we may be disposed to attach to the legendary Gaul\u00eds, the history proper of Gondw\u00e1n\u00e1 only begins in the 16th century. Ferishta indeed mentions a line of princes, whether Gond or not is uncertain, who reigned at Kherl\u00e1 on the S\u00e1tpura plateau, and enjoyed \u2018great wealth and power, being possessed of all the hills of Gondw\u00e1n\u00e1 and other countries.\u2019 They first appear in 1398 A.D.; and for a brief space they succeeded in maintaining a precarious independence, by playing off the rulers of M\u00e1lw\u00e1 and the B\u00e1hmani kings against each other. But, in 1467, Kherl\u00e1 fell before the B\u00e1hmani power, and, after a last expiring effort, the Kherl\u00e1 dynasty disappears from history. In the next century the Gonds asserted themselves with more lasting success. As the Muhammadan power of M\u00e1lw\u00e1 gradually decayed, Sangr\u00e1m S\u00e1h, the forty-eighth R\u00e1j\u00e1 of the Gond line of Garh\u00e1-Mandl\u00e1, issued from the Mandl\u00e1 highlands, and extended his dominion over 52 g\u00e1rhs, comprising the present District of S\u00e1g\u00e1r (Saugor), Damoh, Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d, Narsinghpur, and Jabalpur, besides Mandl\u00e1 and Seoni.\n\nIn the 16th century, also, the immemorial Haihai-Bans\u00ed line of Chhat\u00edsgarh emerges into the light of history; and in the succeeding century, the Gond princes of Deogarh transformed themselves from obscure aboriginal chiefs into a powerful Muhammadan dynasty. From\nthe rise of the Gond power until the advent of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, Gondw\u00e1n\u00e1 enjoyed practical independence. The Gonds willingly owned the supremacy of the Emperor at Delhi, and the distant monarch wisely contented himself with nominally including in his dominions the wild and rugged country of the Gonds. With all its drawbacks, this was a happy period for Gondw\u00e1n\u00e1. The people prospered under a rude feudal system; and the tanks and tombs and palaces, and above all the battlemented stone walls, long since too wide for the shrunken city within, testify to the ability and beneficence of the princes. Indeed, the rulers appear to have been in advance of their subjects; and much of the improvement then effected arose from the prudent liberality with which the wiser R\u00e1j\u00e1s encouraged Hindu husbandmen to settle on the land. But the invasion of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s abruptly ended the peaceful progress of Gondw\u00e1n\u00e1. In the ten years from 1741 to 1751, the Bhonsla family established its dominion over the three kingdoms of Deogarh, Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1, and Chhatisgarh, while the last Gond dynasty, that of Garh\u00e1-Mandl\u00e1, fell before the same race in 1781.\n\nThe founders of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 power had the virtues as well as the vices of military leaders; and at first the Gond people felt the effect of the conquest less than their feudal chiefs. But in the end of the 18th century, the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s began to suffer from the want of money, and every variety of fiscal expedient was contrived to grind taxes from the unfortunate people. In short, a poor man could neither shelter nor clothe himself, nor earn his bread, nor eat it, nor marry, nor rejoice, nor even ask his gods for better weather, without contributing on each individual act to the necessities of his alien rulers. This oppression brought about its natural result. The ruined husbandman forsook his farm, and joined the robber-bands that wandered through the country. By degrees these increased in number; and from their standing camps in the Narbad\u00e1 valley, a marauding cavalry, under the name of Pind\u00e1ris, spread desolation over the land. Encumbered neither by tents nor baggage, and riding in parties of two or three thousand, they carried fire and sword wherever they went, even to the gates of the capital. So lasting has proved the terror they inspired, that to this day there are places in the valley of the Wardh\u00e1 where the shopkeepers will not publicly expose their goods. Thus, harassed in every way, the country had become utterly exhausted when, in 1818, Ap\u00e1 S\u00e1hib was finally deposed. At that time the English annexed the region since known as the S\u00e1g\u00e1r (Saugor) and Narbad\u00e1 (Nerbudda) territories, while undertaking the management of what remained of the Bhonsla kingdom during the minority of Raghuji III. Raghuji attained his majority in 1830; but on his death in 1853, without a child, his dominions lapsed to the British Government. At first, it may be that the administration\nerred in overrating the resources of the country; but under the more lenient assessment of later years an era of prosperity has begun.\n\nIn 1860, the Niz\u00e1m ceded a strip of territory on the left bank of the God\u00e1var\u00ed, formerly styled the Upper God\u00e1var\u00ed District, consisting of 6 taluks, namely, Sironcha, Naog\u00e1on, Albaka, Cherla, Bhadr\u00e1chalam, and R\u00e1kapalli. The two last-named taluks were transferred to Madras in 1874. The four first-named are still attached to the Central Provinces, and now form a Sub-division of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 District. In 1861, the 'Central Provinces' were formed by the union of the S\u00e1g\u00e1r (Saugor) and Narbad\u00e1 (Nerbudda) territories with the N\u00e1gpur Province. In 1864, the new administration obtained an accession of territory by the addition of Nim\u00e1r District; and in the following year it received a further accretion of 700 square miles of country, which formerly constituted the Native State of Bijeraghogarh in Central India, but had been confiscated in 1857.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The table on page 304 exhibits the area, population, etc., of each of the British Districts and Native States included within the Central Provinces, as disclosed by the Census of 1881.\n\nThe 15 Native States are attached to 5 British Districts, although they are under the direct administration of their own chiefs. Makr\u00e1i, with an area of 215 square miles, is attached to Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d District; while the largest State, Bast\u00e1r, 13,062 square miles, is attached to Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1. The remaining 13 are attached to the three Districts of the Chhat\u00edsgarh Division\u2014namely, Chhuikad\u00e1n, K\u00e1nker, Khair\u00e1garh; and Nandg\u00e1on, with an aggregate area of 2658 square miles, to R\u00e1ipur District; Kawardh\u00e1 and Sakti, with an area of 1002 square miles, to Bil\u00e1spur District; and Kal\u00e1hand\u00ed, R\u00e1igarh, S\u00e1rangarh, Patn\u00e1, Sonpur, Rair\u00e1khol, and B\u00e1mra, with an aggregate area of 11,897 square miles, to Sambalpur District. Including Feudatory States, the average area of each District is 6293 square miles, the smallest being Narsinghpur (1916 square miles), the four largest being Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 (23,847 square miles), Sambalpur (16,418 square miles), R\u00e1ipur (14,543 square miles), and Bil\u00e1sapur (8800 square miles). Excluding Feudatory States, the average area of each District is 4691 square miles, the 5 largest Districts being\u2014R\u00e1ipur (11,885 square miles), Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 (10,785 square miles), Bil\u00e1sipur (7798 square miles), Mandl\u00e1 (4719 square miles), and Sambalpur (4521 square miles). Total area of Native States, 28,834 square miles; population (1881), 1,709,720; average density, 59'3 per square mile.\n\nThe area of the Central Provinces in 1881 (including Native States) was less by 886 square miles than the area returned in 1872, owing to the transfer to the Madras Presidency in 1874 of the Bhadr\u00e1chalam and R\u00e1kapalli taluks of the former Upper God\u00e1var\u00ed District. The actual difference, however, proves to be only 518 square miles, on account of\n\n[Sentence continued on p. 305.]\n### Census of the Central Provinces (1881).\n\n#### British Districts.\n\n| Division | District or State | Area in square miles | Number of towns and villages | Number of occupied houses | Total population | Males | Females | Density per square mile | Density per house |\n|----------|-------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|-------|--------|------------------------|------------------|\n| Nagpur   | Bhandar\u0101          | 3,922                | 1616                        | 133,956                  | 683,779         | 349,811| 342,968| 174                     | 5'1              |\n|          | Chanda            | 10,785               | 2804                        | 148,135                  | 649,146         | 326,824| 322,322| 60                      | 4'4              |\n|          | Wardha            | 2,401                | 908                         | 85,044                   | 387,221         | 195,564| 191,657| 161                     | 4'5              |\n|          | Bil\u0101gh\u0101t          | 3,136                | 1211                        | 69,034                   | 340,554         | 168,830| 171,724| 108                     | 4'9              |\n|          | Total             | 24,040               | 8221                        | 580,862                  | 2,758,056       | 1,383,785| 1,374,271| 115                     | 4'7              |\n\n#### Native States.\n\n| Kalahand\u012b or K\u0101rond | 3,745 | 2,461 | 53,527 | 224,548 | 116,918 | 107,630 | 60 | 4'2 |\n| R\u0101igarh             | 1,486 | 685   | 23,282 | 128,943 | 64,767  | 64,176  | 87 | 5'3 |\n| S\u0101ragarh            | 540   | 438   | 25,406 | 71,274  | 35,221  | 36,053  | 132| 2'8 |\n| Patna               | 2,399 | 1,501 | 50,841 | 257,939 | 131,570 | 126,369 | 107| 5'1 |\n| Sonpur              | 906   | 866   | 25,521 | 178,701 | 90,012  | 88,689  | 197| 7'0 |\n| R\u0101irakhol           | 833   | 199   | 3,349  | 17,750  | 9,021   | 8,729   | 21 | 5'3 |\n| P\u0101mra               | 1,988 | 632   | 14,828 | 81,286  | 41,701  | 39,585  | 41 | 5'5 |\n| Sakti               | 115   | 117   | 3,955  | 22,819  | 11,352  | 11,467  | 193| 5'8 |\n| Kawardha            | 887   | 389   | 28,369 | 86,362  | 42,706  | 43,656  | 97 | 3'0 |\n| Chhukad\u0101n or Kondika| 174   | 109   | 9,669  | 32,979  | 16,267  | 16,712  | 189| 3'4 |\n| K\u0101niser             | 639   | 436   | 16,142 | 63,610  | 32,131  | 31,479  | 92 | 3'9 |\n| Kh\u0101ragarh           | 940   | 512   | 30,392 | 166,138 | 82,077  | 84,061  | 176| 5'5 |\n| Nandgaon            | 905   | 541   | 48,351 | 164,339 | 81,717  | 82,622  | 182| 3'4 |\n| Makr\u0101i              | 215   | 59    | 3,380  | 16,764  | 8,521   | 8,243   | 78 | 4'9 |\n| Bast\u0101r              | 13,062| 2,204 | 38,271 | 196,248 | 103,046 | 93,202  | 15 | 5'1 |\n| Total Native States | 28,834| 11,242| 375,283| 1,709,720| 867,687 | 842,033 | 59 | 4'6 |\n\n#### Grand Total Central Provinces.\n\n| Division | Area in square miles | Number of towns and villages | Number of occupied houses | Total population | Males | Females | Density per square mile | Density per house |\n|----------|----------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------|-------|--------|------------------------|------------------|\n|          | 113,279              | 45,854                       | 2,712,259                 | 11,548,511      | 5,827,122| 5,721,389| 102                     | 4'2              |\nshort entries in 1872 of the areas of certain Districts, which were afterwards detected and rectified. Making due allowance for the transfer of the taluks to Madras, the population of the British Districts, which in 1872 was returned at 8,173,824, amounted in 1881 to 9,838,791, showing an increase of 1,664,967, or 20.37 per cent., in the 9 years. In the Feudatory States in 1872, the population was returned at 1,049,710, and in 1881 to 1,709,720, showing an increase of 660,010, or 62.88 per cent. Taking British Districts and Feudatory States together, the population in 1872 was returned at 9,223,534, and in 1881 at 11,548,511, being an increase of 2,324,977, or 25.21 per cent. This enormous increase is due to various causes. In the first place, it is more apparent than real, and is largely made up, especially in the Feudatory States, by the increased accuracy of the Census of 1881 over that of 1872. Among other causes of increase, setting aside the natural increment of births over deaths, are the attraction of labourers to the lines of railway under construction, and the increased facilities to immigration afforded by fresh communications, and the opening up of the country. Large numbers of famine refugees, who flocked into the Districts during scarcities, have now settled down permanently, and become prosperous cultivators.\n\nReligion.\u2014Including British Districts and Feudatory States, the Census of 1881 thus exhibited the classification of the population according to religion:\u2014Hindus, 8,703,110; Sikhs, 99; Kabirpanthis, 347,994; Satnamis, 398,409; Kumbhipathi\u00e1s, 913; Muhammadans, 285,687; Christians, 11,973; Buddhists, 17; Br\u00e1hmos, 7; Jains, 45,911; Jews, 63; P\u00e1rs\u00eds, 399; aboriginal tribes still professing their primitive faiths, 1,753,917; unspecified, 12. The British Districts, with their area of 84,445 square miles, and population of 9,838,791, are thus returned according to religion: Hindus, 7,317,830; Sikhs, 97; Kabirpanthis, 294,474; Satnamis, 358,161; Kumbhipathi\u00e1s, 692; Jains, 45,718; Muhammadans, 275,773; Christians, 11,949; P\u00e1rs\u00eds, 399; Jews, 63; Buddhists, 17; Br\u00e1hmos, 7; non-Hindu aboriginal tribes, 33,599; and unspecified, 12.\n\nAborigines.\u2014The S\u00e1tpura plateau, stretching east and west for nearly 600 miles, with the wheat fields of the Narbad\u00e1 valley on the one hand, and the rice lands of the N\u00e1gpur plain on the other, forms the true barrier between Northern and Southern India. In this natural fastness the so-called aboriginal tribes have found refuge, retreating on either side before the waves of Aryan immigration which swept forward from the Deccan and from Hindust\u00e1n. Army after army invaded the Deccan, and Hindu dynasties rose and fell; but the forests of Gondw\u00e1n\u00e1 lay apart from the line of march; and while the ravages of war wasted the rich cities of the plains, the refugees were slowly gathering\nstrength and confidence. By degrees they issued from the S\u00e1tpura hills, and occupied the rich valleys beneath. But the superiority of the Aryan race manifested itself in peace as in war; and step by step the aboriginal tribes were driven back a second time to the stony uplands, as the Hindu farmers in increasing numbers cleared the fertile plains below. Those who remained were absorbed by the higher race, and now form the lowest stratum of the Hindu social system.\n\nThough Gondw\u00e1n\u00e1 comprised the greater part of the Central Provinces, the non-Aryan tribes now form a minority of the population. The Census of 1881 returned their total number, including those who have embraced Hinduism, as well as those who still adhere to their primitive deities, at 2,776,356, of whom 2,163,241 inhabited British territory, and 613,115 the Feudatory States. The proportion of these tribes to the total population of each District varies from 55\u00b758 in Mandl\u00e1, to only 2\u00b728 in Nim\u00e1r. Though the term 'aborigines' is commonly applied to them, it must be remembered that this is merely a convenient expression, serving to distinguish the tribes in question from races of Aryan descent. In the gravels and clays which apparently mark the Miocene and the Pliocene periods, remains of animals now extinct in India co-exist with the bones of others still found in the Central Provinces. Of later date, however, and scattered through the upper soils of large areas, agate knives and implements have been dug up in the Narbad\u00e1 (Nerbudda) and N\u00e1gpur country; and to a yet later epoch belong the polished celts, axes, and other shaped stone implements, which exactly resemble those abundantly found in Northern Europe. Beyond these indications, we know nothing of any inhabitants of the Provinces who may have preceded the so-called aboriginal tribes. These consist of a southern and a northern section, distinguished as the Dravidian and the Kolarian races. From their curious intermixture within a limited area, Mr. Hislop concludes that the Dravidians, entering India by the north-west, here crossed the stream of Kolarian immigrants from the northeast. One of the Gond hymns, which he has preserved, relates how the Gonds were created near Mount Diw\u00e1lagiri in the Him\u00e1layas; how their gluttonous and impure habits caused a foul odour to arise, which offended the nostrils of Mah\u00e1deva; and how Mah\u00e1deva, while bathing, made a squirrel out of part of his body, and sent it to flee with tail erect before the Gonds. The Gonds pursued the squirrel, and followed it into a cave, which was the god's prison on earth. Then Mah\u00e1deva arose and placed a stone 16 cubits long at the entrance of the cave, and stationed a giant to guard it. But four brothers had remained behind. They travelled on over hill and dale, till by the jungly road they reached K\u00e1chikopa Loh\u00e1rgarh, the Iron valley in the Red Hills. There they found a giant, who was at first inclined to eat them; but\nbecoming pacified, gave them his seven daughters in marriage. From these unions sprang the present Gond race. This legend, at any rate, is consistent with the theory that the Gonds entered the country from the north, and intermarried with the inhabitants they found there.\n\nPointing to the same conclusion is the fact, that till lately they buried their dead with the feet turned northward, so that the corpse might be ready to be borne to the home of its people. But apart from these speculations, the Gonds justly claim attention as in some degree a progressive race, which, with Aryan peoples all around, succeeded in forming and upholding for 200 years an independent power, and which still maintains its separate nationality. From the upper classes, indeed, the pure Gond is rapidly disappearing. Most of the so-called Gond chiefs, and of the families which call themselves \u2018R\u00e1j-Gond\u2019 or \u2018Royal Gond,\u2019 are of mixed blood, though with the aboriginal type still dominant. Yet, while they outdo the Hindus themselves in ceremonial refinements, purifying even their faggots before using them for cooking, they retain a taint of their old mountain superstitions; some still seek to atone for their desertion of the gods of their fathers, by worshipping them in secret once every four or five years, and by placing cow\u2019s flesh to their lips, wrapped in a cloth, so as not to break too openly with the Hindu divinities. But the plebeian or Dh\u00far-Gond is generally of purer blood, owing to the contempt with which the Hindus regard him. The lowest of the Hindu castes ranks above him, and only the Mh\u00e1rs and Dhers take place beneath him in the social scale. To him the contact of a higher civilisation has brought harm rather than good. Amid a Hindu population, his stalwart limbs make him a useful drudge, but his spirit is broken, and his old frankness has vanished. In the highlands, however, the Gond, less contaminated by Hindu influence, appears to greater advantage.\n\nIn the Feudatory State of Bast\u00e1r, the hill tribes constitute at least three-fifths of the population. There the M\u00e1ri\u00e1s form the most numerous caste. The M\u00e1ri\u00e1 carries a small iron knife in his girdle, and a hatchet hangs from his shoulders; but his favourite weapon is the bow. This is made of bamboo; and a strip of the bark of the same useful plant, secured by cords to the ends, supplies the bowstring; the arrows are of many forms, but all pointed with iron. The M\u00e1ri\u00e1s are skilful archers; they use the feet to bend the bow, while they draw the string with both hands, sending an arrow almost through the body of a deer. The M\u00e1ris are still wilder, and invariably fly from their grass-built huts on the approach of strangers. Once a year, an officer collects their tribute for the R\u00e1j\u00e1, which is paid in kind. He beats a tom-tom outside the village, and forthwith hides himself; whereupon the inhabitants bring out whatever they have to give, and deposit it in an appointed spot. The customs\nof the different hill tribes are very similar. The Bhils, indeed, are singular in the jealousy they exhibit about the honour of their women. The Halb\u00e1s, who in Bast\u00e1r make their living by distilling spirits, and worship a pantheon of glorified distillers, have, unlike the other wild tribes, settled down in R\u00e1ipur as successful cultivators, holding their own in the open country.\n\nPhysical Appearance, etc.\u2014Nearly all the hill tribes have the black skin, the flat nose, and the thick lips, which at once proclaim them of other than Aryan blood. Nearly all dress in the same way. For both sexes, a cloth wound about the waist constitutes the chief article of attire. Necklaces of beads, ear-rings of brass and iron, brass bracelets, and girdles of twarris or twisted cords, find favour in the eyes of young men and women. The latter often add chaplets of the large white seeds of the kusa grass, or even a cloth flung carelessly across the shoulder. They seldom wear any covering on the head; and some, as the M\u00e1ri\u00e1s, shave away the hair, leaving only a top knot. The ladies, however, commonly add to their attractions by wearing false hair. In the hymn already cited, the god alleges as one cause of his displeasure against the first created Gonds, that they did not bathe for six months together. It must be confessed that in this respect the hill-tribes of to-day do not belie their ancestry; and though they carry their scanty costume with a certain grace, their dirtiness, and the tattoo marks on their faces, arms, and thighs, have a repellent effect on European observers. For the most part light-hearted and easy-tempered, when once their shyness is overcome, they prove exceedingly communicative; but while naturally frank, and far more truthful than Hindus, they are nevertheless arrant thieves, though their pilfering is generally managed in the simplest and most maladroit manner. All are fond of music, particularly the Gad-bh\u00e1s, who celebrate their festivals by dancing to the sound of a drum and a fife. Sometimes they form a ring by joining hands, and advance in step towards the centre, and again retire while circling round and round. When wearied with dancing, they sing. A man steps out of the crowd, and sings a verse impromptu; a woman rejoins, and the pair chant in alternate strains, for the most part rallying each other on personal defects. All are addicted to drinking. In short, so slight are the differences between the various hill tribes, that in Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1, where the forest country meets the more civilised plain, the Gonds, as the highest class among them, are recruited from the wilder clans; and the ambitious M\u00e1ri\u00e1 styles himself first a Koit\u00far, then a Forest or Jungly Gond, and at last, as time goes on, claims the dignity of a Gond pure and simple.\n\nThe indolence and improvidence of uncivilised peoples manifests itself especially in the manner in which these hill tribes cultivate the soil. The husbandman who practises the d\u016bhya system first\nseeks on the hill-slope for a new piece of ground. This he clears of jungle, and then covers it over with logs of wood, heaping up smaller brushwood on the top. Just before the rains, when the hot weather has thoroughly dried the newly-cut wood, he sets fire to the pile. After the first rainfall, he scatters the millet, or other inferior grain, among the ashes; or, where the ground is steep, merely throws the seed in a lump along the top of the plot, and leaves it to be washed to its place by the rains. This facile mode of husbandry, now happily less practised than formerly, has not only tended to discourage all habits of settled industry, but must be held responsible for the ruin which has overtaken so many of the once magnificent forests of the Central Provinces.\n\nMost different accounts have been given of the Gond religion. Mr. Hislop thinks that their pantheon consists of fifteen gods. At Bet\u00fal, it is said, the Gonds count at least twelve religious sects, distinguished by the number of deities they respectively worship. The usual number is seven; but the lowest caste adores an indefinite number, being those which chanced to be omitted when the original distribution of gods to each sect took place. But the fact is, that the religious beliefs of these tribes vary from village to village; and nowhere has their theological system attained such a pitch of precision as to enable them to exactly define the number of their gods. While admitting the existence of other deities, each village worships those of whom it happens to be cognizant; and these seldom exceed three or four in number. In Mandl\u00e1, Th\u00e1kur Deo is held in great reverence. He is the household god, presiding over the homestead and the farmyard: and, being omnipresent, requires no image to represent him. The people of the village of J\u00e1t\u00e1, however, have the happiness to possess a few links of an ancient chain in which the god manifests himself. Gifted with the power of motion, this chain sometimes appears hanging from a ber tree, sometimes on a stone below, sometimes in the bed of a neighbouring watercourse. Each of these movements is duly made the occasion of some humble sacrifice, to the advantage of the attendant B\u00e1ig\u00e1 priest.\n\nIn many places Ghansy\u00e1m Deo is greatly adored. His worshippers build for him a rude hut about a hundred yards from the village. In one corner they plant a bamboo with a red or yellow rag tied to the end; and, hanging up a withered garland or two, and strewing about the floor a few blocks of rough stone smeared with vermilion, they dedicate the place to Ghansy\u00e1m Deo. There every November the whole village assembles to worship, with sacrifices of fowls and spirits, or even a pig. Presently the god descends on the head of one of the worshippers, who staggers to and fro, bereft of his senses, till he wildly rushes into the jungle. Then, happy that a scapegoat has been found for the sins of the village, the people send two or three men\nafter him, who bring the fugitive back. Throughout the Central Provinces the Gonds worship cholera and small-pox, under the names of M\u00e1ri and M\u00e1t\u00e1 Dev\u00ed. To appease the wrath of these divinities, they offer sacrifices; and, cleaning their villages, they place the sweepings on a road or track, in the hope that some traveller will be infected, and so convey the disease away into another village. But in addition to his gods, the Gond peoples the forest in which he lives with spirits of all kinds, most of them able and only too willing to inflict evil upon him. To propitiate them, he sets up p\u0101ts, consisting of a bamboo, with a piece of rag tied to the end, a heap of stones, or the like. There the spirit takes up his abode, and then, at each festival in the family, the spirit has his share of the banquet.\n\nThe B\u00e1ig\u00e1s, with whom some authorities identify the Bh\u00e1\u00edmi\u00e1s, are the acknowledged priests of the hill tribes. Physically finer men than the ordinary Gond, and surpassing him in courage and skill as sportsmen, they have won for themselves a respect which is rarely abused; and in any question, whether of a religious observance or of a boundary dispute, their decision is final. When a Gond falls victim to a tiger, the B\u00e1ig\u00e1 is called in to lay the spirit of the dead, and to charm away the additional power which the tiger has derived from his prey. The B\u00e1ig\u00e1 goes through certain movements, representing the tiger in his fatal spring; and, lastly, takes up with his teeth a mouthful of the blood-stained earth. This done, the jungle is free again. While worshipping the same gods as the Gonds, the B\u00e1ig\u00e1s have a special reverence for M\u00e1\u00ed Dharitri\u2014mother earth.\n\nHow far serpent-worship prevailed in Gondw\u00e1n\u00e1 has given rise to much speculation. The Gond of to-day would be more likely to eat a snake than to worship it. But traces of a serpent cult yet remain, the most curious of these being the ancient temple of Buram Dev\u00e1 in Chhatisgarh. It contains no image but that of a cobra, near which are two inscriptions, one being a list of twenty-two kings, who trace their descent to the union of a snake with the daughter of a holy man who lived south of the Narbad\u00e1. The name of N\u00e1gpur, and the number of non-Aryan families which claim a N\u00e1gbansi connection, seems to show that snake-worship formerly existed in Gondw\u00e1n\u00e1. Probably it was never more than an aristocratic cult, confined to certain houses. As its practice ceased, the claim to serpent descent died out as well, and the existing N\u00e1gbansi families have become, or aspire to be, R\u00e1jputs.\n\nThat the shy and timid hill tribes should be capable of offering human sacrifices has appeared incredible to some writers; but the custom has existed at certain places within the memory of the present generation. In the temples of K\u00e1l\u00ed in Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 and L\u00e1nj\u00ed, and in the famous shrine of Danteswar\u00ed in Bast\u00e1r, many a human head has been presented on the altar. The victim was taken to the temple after sun-\nset, and shut up within its dismal walls. In the morning when the door was opened, he was found dead, to the glory of the great goddess, who had shown her power during the night by descending to suck his blood.\n\nBirths and marriages are celebrated by some peculiar customs, and no ceremony is reckoned complete without a drinking bout. The pretended abduction of the bride forms part of the wedding ceremony. Sometimes a visitor will serve for his wife during a stated number of years, after the manner of Jacob; but more frequently the wife is purchased by the bridegroom. For this reason, the cheaper plan of marrying a near relation finds favour with the poor or frugal lover. As a rule, the Gonds bury their dead, and sometimes kill a cow over the grave; but the more prosperous families now sometimes burn an adult corpse, after the manner of the Hindus. 'Waking' the dead forms an important part of the funeral rites.\n\n**Hindu Population.**\u2014The gradual displacement of the hill tribes in one of their last refuges by Hindu races is clearly shown by the simple fact that, whereas the so-called aborigines (outside Hindu influences) number less than two millions, the Hindus, in 1881, numbered 8,703,110, thus forming 75.36 per cent. of the inhabitants of the Central Provinces, including Native States. The denser the population, the greater is the proportion of Hindus, varying from 83.39 per cent. in the Nagpur plain and Wardha valley to 56.57 per cent. on the Satpura plateau.\n\nA few isolated hermits were the first Aryans who ventured to invade these central forests; and the Ramayan\u00e1 laments the sufferings these holy men endured amid the savage tribes. 'These shapeless and ill-looking monsters testify their abominable character by various cruel and terrific displays. These base-born wretches implicate the hermits in impure practices, and perpetrate the greatest outrages. Changing their shapes and hiding in the thickets adjoining the hermitages, these frightful beings delight in terrifying the devotees. They cast away the sacrificial ladles and vessels, they pollute the cooked oblations, and utterly defile the offerings with blood. These faithless creatures inject frightful sounds into the ears of the faithful and austere eremites. At the time of sacrifice, they snatch away the jars, the flowers, the fuel, and the sacred grass of these sober-minded men.' But though ruled by Rajput chiefs at an earlier period, the country was not really opened out to Hindu settlement till the time of Akbar, whose armies penetrated to the easternmost parts of the valley of the Narbad\u00e1. The oldest rupees found buried here date from this reign. The mass, however, of the Hindu population is of later date, and may probably be referred to the time of Aurangzeb. Between the Hindus north and those south of the Satpuras the contrast both in character and appearance is striking.\nThe Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 of the N\u00e1gpur rice-lands has neither the energy nor the independence of the peasant who tills the wheat-fields by the Narbad\u00e1; and on a festal day, when a southern crowd presents a mass of white clothing and enormous red turbans, the more northern people may be known by their costume of mahua green, and their jaunty head-dress of white cloth.\n\nLocal Sects.\u2014While worshipping the usual divinities of the Hindu pantheon, the Hindus of the Central Provinces, more especially the Jh\u00e1r\u00e1s, or older settlers, have contracted various local beliefs and habits. The adoration of the dead prevails universally. Thus, in Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d, the Ghori (Muhammadan) kings of M\u00e1lw\u00e1 have attained the dignity of gods, while near Bhand\u00e1r\u00e1 the villagers worship at the tomb of an English lady. Most castes place little or no restriction on widow-marriage, and generally the marriage tie is but little regarded, illegitimate children succeeding to property equally with those born in wedlock. But the non-Aryan belief in the powers of evil especially dominates the conquering race. Throughout the Province, M\u00e1t\u00e1 Dev\u00ed, the goddess of small-pox, is held in veneration. The prevalence of witchcraft also presses heavily on the Hindu. So infested by witches was the wild hill country from Mandl\u00e1 to the eastern coast, that at one time no prudent father would let his daughter marry into a family which did not count among its members at least one of the dangerous sisterhood. Even now, should a man's bullock die, his crop fail, or sickness befall him, he imputes the calamity to witchcraft. The suspected sorcerer in such a case is arrested, and a fisherman's net being wound about his head to prevent him from bewitching his guards, his innocence is tested by the flicker of a flame or the fall of a pipal leaf. In Bast\u00e1r this ordeal is followed by sewing him up in a sack, and letting him down into water waist-deep. If he succeeds in raising his head above water, his guilt is held manifest. Then the villagers beat the culprit with rods of tamarind or the castor-oil plant, and shave his head. Lastly, they knock out his teeth, so that the witch can neither mutter charms nor revenge himself by assuming the form of a tiger.\n\nThe Satu\u00e1m\u00eds.\u2014Perhaps the most interesting movement among the Hindus of the Province is the religious and social uprising of the Cham\u00e1rs of Chhat\u00edsgarh. Upper India contains no more despised race. In the distribution of employments nothing had been left to them but the degrading handicraft of skinning dead cattle. But in the plain of Chhat\u00edsgarh the want of labour had admitted them to the rank of cultivators, and prepared them to break the humiliating tradition. About fifty years ago, Gh\u00e1si D\u00e1s, an unlettered but remarkable visionary, withdrew into the wilderness, after bidding his followers meet him in six months' time at Girod. Thither, on the appointed day, the\nCham\u00e1rs crowded, and, in the quiet of the early morning, the prophet appeared descending from the rocky height above the village. There he delivered his message from heaven. He proclaimed that all men are equal; he forbade the worship of idols; and he named himself as the high priest of the new faith, adding that the office would remain in his family for ever. On the death of Gh\u00e1si D\u00e1s, his eldest son, B\u00e1lik D\u00e1s, succeeded to the primacy; and such was the enmity excited among the Hindus, that he was murdered in 1860. Nearly all the Cham\u00e1rs of Chhat\u00edsgarh have accepted the new religion, adopting the name of Satn\u00e1m\u00eds. They have no temple or form of prayer; but every morning and evening they fall prostrate before the sun, exclaiming, \u2018Sat n\u00e1m! Sat n\u00e1m! Sat n\u00e1m!\u2019 or, \u2018God! God! God!\u2019 They eat no meat, and drink only water; but a schism has arisen among them regarding the use of tobacco. In sexual matters their practice is lax; but the allegation that Satn\u00e1mi brides associate with the high priest before entering their husbands\u2019 home is, they maintain, a calumny of their enemies. In 1881, the Satn\u00e1m\u00eds numbered 398,409 in the Central Provinces. They form a loyal and industrious class of the population.\n\nThe Kab\u00edrpanth\u00eds, or followers of Kabir, a disciple of R\u00e1manand, an apostle of Northern India, who lived in the 15th century, are numerous in the Central Provinces, where, however, they have given up that rejection of caste which was a fundamental tenet in the teachings of Kab\u00edr. Of the 347,994 persons enumerated as of the Kabirpanthi sect, 118,768 were returned as Pank\u00e1s, and 83,014 as Tel\u00eds by caste; the remainder including representatives from other castes, among which were 4438 R\u00e1jputs. The Kab\u00edrpanth\u00eds are most numerous in the Districts of Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1, Raipur, and Bil\u00e1spur. The following account of them is condensed from two papers furnished by Mr. Sad\u00e1shiv Vithal, Inspector of Schools, Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1, and B\u00e1bu Taradas Banarji, B.A., pleader, Raipur, and published in the Census Report for 1881:\u2014Kabir preached the equality of man before God, denounced all caste distinctions and idol-worship, and addressed himself to Hindus and Muhammadans alike. But on the death of Kabir at Mugher, the religion promulgated by him underwent changes, and renunciation of caste ceased to be a preliminary of initiation. At present the chief ordinances of the faith as preached and practised in the Central Provinces, but with variations in different localities, are\u2014(1) to avoid idol-worship; (2) to perform no pilgrimages to Hindu holy places; and (3) to avoid the use of flesh, or any kind of spirituous liquor. Although there is no absolute prohibition against the admission of any caste into the sect of the Kabirpanth\u00eds, there is now a tendency towards the exclusion of the lowest castes, and it is stated that the conversion of Cham\u00e1rs is neither attempted nor allowed. The ceremony of the initiation is very simple. Persons who wish to be\nordinary Kab\u00edrpanth\u00eds are generally admitted to the faith at the residence of the local mahant or priest. A piece of ground having been cleaned and consecrated, the religious pass-word (mantra) is blown in the orthodox manner into the ear of the convert, and he is presented with some betel leaves and sweetmeats; a necklace of wooden beads is then placed round his neck, and he is not supposed to eat or drink thereafter without wearing this necklace. The convert then makes offerings to the mahant, according to his means. Those who become ascetics wear necklaces of a different pattern, and also wear a peaked skull-cap. These ascetics travel about asking alms and (those who can read) explaining their sacred books.\n\nThe chief guru or head of the faith in the Central Provinces resides at Kawardha, the capital of a Feudatory State attached to Bil\u00e1spur District. He does not appear to be more learned than his disciples, and is said to be more careful of his own secular concerns than of the spiritual welfare of his followers. He appoints a certain number of deputies called bhand\u00e1r\u00eds and mahants from the more advanced of his followers, who, after paying a good sum for the privilege, travel through the country, and recoup themselves by contributions from their own disciples, of whom they manage to get together a large number. They are not bound to observe celibacy, but numbers of them assume that state for the sake of the peculiar sanctity which the multitude ascribe to it. Unlike the Cham\u00e1r Satn\u00e1m\u00eds, all of whom follow some sort of a secular occupation, the Kab\u00edrpanth\u00eds include a considerable body who, though not professing celibacy like the Hindu bair\u00e1g\u00eds, yet resemble them a good deal in their habits and customs. They go about in pairs, begging from door to door, reciting moral precepts in verse to the accompaniment of a single stringed instrument, resembling a guitar, and two pieces of black wood beaten one against the other to keep time. The Kab\u00edrpanth\u00eds profess allegiance to the guru at Kawardh\u00e1, but keep their earnings to themselves. They are generally well versed in the doctrines of their sect, and often enter into controversies with members of other sects, defending their position by quotations from the metrical polemics of Kab\u00edr, and annually converting a number of persons from the lower orders of Hindus. As Kab\u00edrism does not involve loss of caste, or any sort of social degradation; as it does not impose any wearisome or costly ceremonial; as its doctrines are more simple and better suited to the understanding of the masses than those of Hinduism; and as they are embodied in a series of simple Hindust\u00e1n\u00ed verses, easily understood and remembered by all, Kab\u00edrism has gone on increasing in strength and prosperity. It is worthy of note that in the Central Provinces, almost the whole of the Kabirpanth\u00eds are married, whereas in Northern India the greater part of them are vowed to celibacy.\nThe greater number of Kab\u00edrpanth\u00eds in the Central Provinces are the Pank\u00e1s, Tel\u00eds, and G\u00e1nd\u00e1s, which classes have adopted the religion en masse. But among other castes who have joined the fraternity are\u2014Br\u00e1hmans (very few), R\u00e1jputs, Baniy\u00e1s, Naus, Dhob\u00eds, and even Muhammadans. The Br\u00e1hmans and R\u00e1jputs are expelled from caste on their conversion to Kab\u00edrism, and thenceforward occupy the same position as is held by Hindu bair\u00e1g\u00eds; and it is from them that the bhand\u00e1r\u00eds and mahants are mostly selected. The Kabirpanth\u00eds of the present day recognise and retain caste distinctions as tenaciously as the most orthodox Hindus, and all ceremonies are performed by Hindu priests according to established ritual. Ordinarily, no Kabirpanth\u00ed of one caste will eat food cooked by a member of another, and it is only when they meet at Kawardh\u00e1 on some festive occasion that the rule is somewhat relaxed. The different castes, of course, never intermarry. In their social relations, habits, and superstitions, the Kabirpanth\u00eds differ but slightly from the Satn\u00e1mis.\n\nThe Kumbhip\u00e1thi\u00e1s are a small sect peculiar in the Central Provinces to Sambalpur District and its attached Feudatory States, and number only 913 members. Their religion, which is of quite modern origin, appears to have sprung into existence in the Ang\u00fal and Dhenk\u00e1n\u00e1l States of Orissa as recently as 1866. The name of the founder of the religion is unknown, and its followers state that he is a formless spiritual being, who resides in heaven. His chief disciple Gobind D\u00e1s is dead; and another disciple Narsingh has erected a math or temple to his memory in Bank\u00ed. The sect has also another temple in Bank\u00ed at Malbahar. They have a religious book of predictions called Malik\u00e1, and are divided into three sects\u2014the Kumbhip\u00e1thi\u00e1 Gos\u00e1ins, the Kanap\u00e1thi\u00e1 Gos\u00e1ins, and Ashritas. The two former sects have renounced the world, and the followers of the one do not eat with those of the other. The third sect, the Ashritas, are not ascetics or celibates, nor are they turned out of caste. They look up to the other two sects as their gurus or spiritual guides, and follow their teaching. They bathe in the early morning, and prostrate themselves before the sun at the time of its rising and setting, never eating after sunset. Each sect has a separate temple or place of prayer. They recognise the Bhagavat, one of the Hindu religious books, but interpret it differently to the Hindus. They do not acknowledge the images of the Hindu gods, arguing that as no mortal has ever seen the Supreme Being, it is impossible to form his image. Although believing in the existence of the thirty-three crores of Hindu gods and goddesses, they do not worship or obey them, asserting that it is not necessary to obey the servant, but only the master. Their worship consists of prayer and praise to the immaterial Being, whom they call Alekh.\n\nThe N\u00e1nakpanth\u00eds are not numerous in the Central Provinces, and\nare returned in the Census Report as a nonconformist sect of Hindus rather than as a separate religion. They follow the doctrines of N\u00e1nak, the founder of the Sikh religion, who taught the people that prayer consisted in meditation on the Supreme Being, and that all external forms of worship were sinful. *N\u00e1m*, *D\u00e1n*, and *Sn\u00e1n* (the repetition of the holy name, the giving of charity, and cleanliness of body), form the essence of his teaching. N\u00e1nak, who taught his principles 100 years after Kab\u00edr, respected the Vedas, and derived his tenets therefrom, but did not recognise the S\u00e1stras. Whilst the aim of Kab\u00edr was to leave one common religion for Hindus and Muhammadans alike, that of N\u00e1nak was to popularize the teaching of the Vedas. Kab\u00edr denounced the Hindu incarnations as impostors, whilst N\u00e1nak admitted that they were inspired men. The essence of the two religions is the same, with this difference, that Kab\u00edr's faith claims to be a religion by itself, whilst that of N\u00e1nak may be said to be an offshoot of the Vedantic religion of the Hindus. The N\u00e1nakshah\u00eds are a devotee order within the N\u00e1nakpanth\u00ed sect.\n\nThe Singhapant\u00edis are followers of Singh\u00e1j\u00ed, a local saint, himself a Gaur\u00ed or herdsman by caste, in whose name Hindu temples have been erected in Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d and Nim\u00e1r Districts, which are frequented by people of all castes. They are returned in the Census among the Hindus.\n\nThe Dham\u00eds are a local sect found only in D\u00e1moh and S\u00e1g\u00e1r Districts, followers of Prann\u00e1th, and known also as Parn\u00e1m\u00eds, who combine the reading of the Kur\u00e1n with Hindu observances. They are also included in the Census among the Hindus.\n\n**Hindu Castes.**\u2014Of the recognised Hindus castes, the upper classes consist of Br\u00e1hmans, 359,886; R\u00e1jputs, 240,985; K\u00e1yasths, 32,034; Kalit\u00e1 or Kulta, a cognate caste to the Kalit\u00e1s of Assam, peculiar to Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur and the Chhat\u00edsgarh Division of the Central Provinces, 92,827 in number; Baniy\u00e1s or traders, 76,447. The lower Hindu castes, exceeding 50,000 in number, are the following, arranged according to number, and not according to social rank. Cham\u00e1r, the most numerous but one of the lowest castes in the Central Provinces, skinners, leather dealers, agricultural labourers, etc., 760,101 in number, of whom about one-half belong to the Satn\u00e1m\u00ed sect; Kurmi, the principal agricultural caste, 749,528; Tel\u00ed, oil-pressers, cultivators, carters, etc., 632,934; Ah\u00edr, cattle-rearers and dairymen, cultivators, and farm-servants, 509,526; Mah\u00e1r, weavers, day-labourers, village watchmen, grass-cutters, etc., 322,016; Lodhi, landholders and cultivators, 265,147; G\u00e1nd\u00e1, weavers, cultivators, field labourers, etc., 250,133; Mehr\u00e1, weavers, cultivators, and village watchmen, 242,304; Gauri, herdsmen, 214,936; M\u00e1r\u00e1r, gardeners and cultivators, 200,900; Dhim\u00e1r, fishermen, silk rearers, domestic servants, water-carriers, etc., 194,453; Kewat or Keut, the\ngreat fishing caste, also labourers, 165,591; Kall\u00e1r, spirit distillers and sellers, 156,780; Pank\u00e1, weavers, cultivators, field labourers, etc., 141,726; N\u00e1i, barber, 131,614; Koshti, weavers, 129,559; Dhob\u00ed, washermen, 119,936; Kachhi, cultivators, chiefly of garden crops and sugar-cane, 116,677; M\u00e1li, gardeners, 115,821; Gauri, cattle attendants, cartmen, cultivators, and field labourers, 110,363; Loh\u00e1r, iron-smiths, 109,370; Ponw\u00e1r, agriculturists of R\u00e1jput descent, 106,086; Kumbh\u00e1r, potters, 89,201; Son\u00e1r, goldsmiths, 84,718; Barhai, carpenters, 66,396; Guj\u00e1r, cultivators, 60,334; Gadari\u00e1, shepherds, 54,750; Banj\u00e1r\u00e1, pack-bullock carriers and traders, 52,570.\n\nMuhammadans.\u2014Of the Muhammadan population in the Central Provinces, 259,608, or 94.14 per cent., were recorded as of the Sunn\u00ed sect, and only 6772, or 2.46 per cent., as Shi\u00e1s, 166 as Wah\u00e1b\u00eds, and 20 as Faraiz\u00eds. General ignorance was found to prevail among the population as to the distinction between the sects; and 9207 persons, or 3.47 per cent. of the total Muhammadan population, were returned simply as Muhammadans, without specification of sect. The only Districts in which the Shi\u00e1s exceeded 1000 in number are\u2014Nim\u00e1r, 1455; and N\u00e1gpur, 1141.\n\nJains numbered 45,911 in 1881 throughout the Central Provinces. They are chiefly traders and commercial clerks from R\u00e1jput\u00e1n\u00e1. They are most numerous in S\u00e1g\u00e1r District, where they number 16,432.\n\nChristian Sects.\u2014The 11,973 Christians in the Central Provinces comprise\u2014British-born Europeans, 2774; other Europeans and Americans, 1145; Eurasians, 1230; Native Christians, 5558; Indian Portuguese, 206; unspecified, 1060. As regards religious sects, the Roman Catholics rank first, with 5833, of whom 4258 are natives; Church of England, 3802, of whom 393 are natives; Presbyterians, 715, including 317 natives; Methodists, 100; \u2018Protestants,\u2019 \u2018Christians,\u2019 and \u2018others\u2019 (not separately classified), 1523.\n\nDistribution into Town and Country.\u2014The population of the country is almost entirely rural, the inhabitants of the 52 towns containing upwards of 5000 inhabitants being only 697,644, or 6 per cent. of the total, or a fraction higher than the urban population in Bengal. The balance of 1,083,867, or 9.4 per cent., makes up the rural population. The following is a list of the 52 largest towns, with their population in 1881:\n\n| Town          | Population |\n|---------------|------------|\n| N\u00e1gpur        | 98,299     |\n| Jabalpur      | 75,705     |\n| K\u00e1mpt\u00fa        | 50,957     |\n| S\u00e1g\u00e1r         | 44,416     |\n| Burh\u00e1npur     | 30,017     |\n| R\u00e1ipur        | 24,948     |\n| Ch\u00e1nda        | 16,137     |\n| Ho-hang\u00e1b\u00e1d   | 15,863     |\n| Kh\u00e1ndw\u00e1       | 15,142     |\n| Umre\u00ed         | 14,247     |\n| Sambalpur     | 13,919     |\n| Garh\u00e1kota     | 11,414     |\n| Hard\u00e1         | 11,203     |\n| Bhand\u00e1r\u00e1      | 11,150     |\n| Narsinghpur   | 10,222     |\n| Seoni         | 10,203     |\n| Paun\u00ed         | 9,773      |\n| Hinghangh\u00e1t   | 9,000      |\n| D\u00e1moh         | 8,665      |\n| Murw\u00e1r\u00e1       | 8,612      |\n| Kh\u00e1p\u00e1         | 8,405      |\n| Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1    | 8,220      |\n| G\u00e1darw\u00e1r\u00e1     | 8,100      |\n| Arv\u00ed          | 8,072      |\n| War\u00f3r\u00e1        | 8,022      |\n| Sonpur        | 7,928      |\n| R\u00e1mtek        | 7,814      |\nOf the total number of 45,854 villages and towns in the Central Provinces, including the Feudatory States, considerably more than one-half, or 27,616, contain less than two hundred inhabitants; 13,488 have between two hundred and five hundred; 3764 between five hundred and a thousand; 736 between one thousand and two thousand; 130 between two and three thousand; 68 between three and five thousand; 36 between five and ten thousand; 7 between ten and fifteen thousand; 3 between fifteen and twenty thousand; 3 between twenty and fifty thousand; and 3 upwards of fifty thousand inhabitants.\n\nOccupations.\u2014Excluding the 15 Feudatory States, the Census Report returned the male population of the British Districts according to occupation in the following six groups:\u2014(1) Professional class, including civil and military officers, Government officials of every description, and the learned professions, 107,411. (2) Domestic class, including house servants, inn and lodging-house keepers, etc., 47,217. (3) Commercial class, including merchants, traders, carriers, etc., 71,926. (4) Agricultural and pastoral class, including gardeners, 2,210,021. (5) Industrial class, including manufacturers and artisans, 610,068. (6) Indefinite and non-productive, including male children, persons of unspecified occupations, etc., 1,902,792.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014In the year 1882-83, the area under cultivation was estimated at 15,516,800 acres, of which rice, wheat, and other food-grains occupied 13,653,900 acres, or about 85 per cent. of the whole. Cotton was grown on 1,612,687 acres, chiefly in N\u00e1gpur, Wardh\u00e1, Nim\u00e1r, Narsinghpur, Chhindw\u00e1ra, and S\u00e1g\u00e1r; and these six Districts, with R\u00e1ipur and Bil\u00e1spur, have also the largest area under oil-seeds. The cultivation of tobacco is almost confined to R\u00e1ipur.\n\nNearly every form of land tenure found in India exists in the Central Provinces. Besides the estates of feudatory and of non-feudatory chiefs, known as zamind\u00e1ris, the succession to which follows the law of primogeniture, what is termed the malguz\u00e1ri tenure prevails most widely. The estate, whether the property of one or many owners, is managed by a single proprietor, and the land is chiefly held by cultivators whose rents are thrown into a common stock. The profits are divided, or the losses made up, in proportion to the respective shares of the different proprietors.\n\nThe total agricultural population of the British Districts of the Central\nProvinces, male and female, amounted in 1881 to 3,778,040, or 38.40 per cent. of the whole; average cultivated and cultivable area, 9 acres per head of the agricultural population. Landed proprietors numbered 93,993; tenants with occupancy rights, 345,562; assistants in home cultivation, 826,090; tenants at will, 1,133,699; agricultural labourers, herdsmen, graziers, etc., 1,356,379. Total area of British Districts, 84,445 square miles, of which 64,121 square miles are assessed for Government revenue or pay a light quit-rent, while 20,324 square miles are revenue-free and unassessed. Total amount of Government assessment, including local rates and cesses levied on land, \u00a3647,345, or an average of 9\u00bdd. per cultivated acre. Total rental actually paid by the cultivators, \u00a31,326,024, or an average of 1s. 9d. per cultivated acre. These averages are, however, below the general rates paid for Government (kh\u00e1ls\u00e1) land, as they include the payments made by the zamind\u00e1ri estates, which are only nominal and of the nature of quit-rents.\n\nCommerce and Manufactures.\u2014The only important manufactures consist of weaving, and smelting and working iron-ore. The tissue work of Burh\u00e1npur, and the richly embroidered wearing apparel produced in parts of N\u00e1gpur and Bhand\u00e1r\u00e1, command an extensive sale beyond the Province; and the excellence of the ores smelted near G\u00e1darw\u00e1r\u00e1 deserves notice. The internal trade is conducted by means of markets and fairs, the latter of which for the most part had a religious origin and still retain a religious character. The chief external trade is with Bombay westward. The principal imports consist of cotton piece-goods, hardware, salt, cocoa-nuts, European liquors, tobacco, etc.; and the principal exports are raw cotton, grain, ghi, oil-seeds, and Indian piece-goods. Next in importance is the trade with the North-Western Provinces and Calcutta, the main imports being sugar from Mirz\u00e1pur, piece-goods, indigo, jute bags, European liquors, etc.; and the exports, cotton for the mills at Cawnpur, lac, iron, grain, etc. With the Central India States a considerable traffic exists; but with the Niz\u00e1m's Dominions and Ber\u00e1r, and other parts of India, the trade is comparatively small. The M\u00e1lw\u00e1 opium, which passes through the Province for export to China, now goes through Nim\u00e1r to Bombay by rail without being registered as in former years. Excluding this opium and other through trade, the totals may be thus presented:\u2014Imports, in 1882-83, 129,453 tons\u2014value, \u00a33,134,785; exports, in 1882-83, 474,211 tons\u2014value, \u00a34,195,874; total imports and exports, 603,664 tons\u2014value, \u00a37,330,659.\n\nMeans of Communication.\u2014The want of good means of communication, especially important in a land-locked region, has greatly retarded the progress of the Central Provinces. After the rains, the larger rivers become navigable, but the rocky barriers which occur in their channels restrict the use of this mode of transit. In 1882, the total length of\nwater communication was returned at 1373 miles. The making of roads, which may be said to date from the establishment of the British power, is rendered difficult by the nature of the country; and, taught by experience, the local engineering department has now laid down the principle that black-soil roads should be constructed on the principles applicable to a morass. In 1882, the total length of made roads throughout the Province was returned at 2833 miles. N\u00e1gpur forms the centre of the road system. From that city branch off\u2014the northern road, to Seoni and Jabalpur (Jubbulpore); the eastern line, by Bhandar\u00e1 and R\u00e1ipur, to Sambalpur; the north-western, to Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1; and the southern and south-western, to Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 or Wardh\u00e1. But besides these roads, of which the first only can be called complete, numerous ancient tracks wind over hills and across the rocky beds of streams, along which the Banj\u00e1r\u00e1s drive their long trains of pack-bullocks. The Great Indian Peninsula Railway enters the Central Provinces near Burh\u00e1npur, and runs along the valley of the Narbad\u00e1, passing Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d, Narsinghpur, and Jabalpur, till it emerges from the north-east corner of the Province, near Bal\u00edhr\u00ed. Starting from Bhus\u00e1wal, a tributary line connects Wardh\u00e1 and N\u00e1gpur with the main railway, supplying communication with the coal-fields of Waror\u00e1. A further branch is being constructed from N\u00e1gpur to Chhat\u00edsgarh, the completion of which will open up the great granary of the Central Provinces; 146 miles of this line up to R\u00e1jh\u00e1ng\u00e1on were opened in February 1883.\n\nThe following is a list of the different Chief Commissioners who have administered the Central Provinces since their constitution into a separate administration:\u2014Colonel E. K. Elliott, 11th December 1861; Lieutenant-Colonel J. K. Spence (officiating), 27th February 1862; Mr. R. Temple (officiating), 25th April 1862; Colonel E. K. Elliott, 18th December 1863; Mr. J. S. Campbell (officiating), 12th March 1864; Mr. R. Temple, 17th March 1864; Mr. J. S. Campbell (officiating), 24th April 1865; Mr. R. Temple, 6th November 1867; Mr. G. Campbell, 27th November 1867; Mr. J. H. Morris (officiating), 16th April 1868, confirmed 27th May 1870; Colonel R. H. Keatinge, V.C., C.S.I. (officiating), 8th July 1870; Mr. J. H. Morris, C.S.I., 6th July 1872; Mr. C. Grant (officiating), 11th April 1879; Mr. J. H. Morris, 15th November 1879; Mr. W. B. Jones, C.S.I., 30th April 1883; and Mr. C. H. T. Crossthwaite (officiating), 1st April 1884.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The administration is carried on by a Chief Commissioner, aided by a Secretary and a Junior Secretary, in direct subordination to the Government of India. The courts, civil and criminal, are separately controlled by a chief judge, under the name of Judicial Commissioner. The administrative staff consists of 4 Commissioners, 18 Deputy Commissioners, 13 Assistant Commissioners, 33 extra-Assistant\nCommissioners, and 49 tahsildars or sub-Collectors, who are distributed over 18 Districts, grouped into 4 Divisions. The police force, consisting of 18 District Superintendents, 2 assistant District Superintendents, 38 inspectors, and 8037 petty officers and constables, is controlled by an inspector-general; but in its executive functions is subordinate to the District authorities. Education, forest conservancy, and vaccination have separate establishments, though they receive aid from the regular civil staff. The medical staff is directly subordinate to the executive authorities, though the heads of the Medical Department throughout India exercise a general supervision. The Public Works Department owns no subordination to any local authority but the Chief Commissioner, to whom the provincial chief engineer is secretary in that branch of the administration. In 1882\u201383, the imperial and provincial revenue amounted to \u00a31,227,000, of which \u00a3669,421 was derived from land. The income from local funds was \u00a370,680. There are 61 municipalities, the total income of which during 1882\u201383 amounted to \u00a388,796, and their total expenditure to \u00a3136,334. This, however, includes a sum of \u00a367,672 spent on waterworks, to meet the cost of which, municipalities borrowed \u00a355,000. Together, they contained a population of 697,271, and the incidence of municipal taxation averaged 2s. 6d. per head.\n\nEducation.\u2014In 1883, there were altogether 1565 schools in the Central Provinces, of which 1,457 were devoted to primary education. The scholars numbered 89,506, the average daily attendance being 67,397. Though 89 primary schools were devoted to girls, female education progresses but slowly. The conception is in advance of the people, and the difficulty of providing a suitable teaching staff forms a practical obstacle.\n\nClimate and Meteorology.\u2014A hilly country, such as the Central Provinces, with a large surface of rock exposed, and having rapid drainage, lying partly within the tropics at a considerable distance from the sea, and separated from it on all sides by ranges of hills of great elevation, would naturally have a hot and dry climate. The temperature is to some extent modified by the general elevation of the country. The south-west monsoon, which prevails from the end of June to the beginning of September, usually brings with it an abundant rainfall, and the wide tracts of forest, covering so large a portion of the area of the Province, retards evaporation. But notwithstanding these modifying influences, a climate still remains, of which a high temperature and a low degree of humidity are marked characteristics for nine months in the year.\n\nAs regards temperature, in the hot months of April and May, Nagpur, which lies below the Satpuras in the Nagpur plain, exceeds both Bengal and the Upper Provinces. In the rains, from June to September,\nthe temperature of N\u00e1gpur is nearly the same as that of Calcutta, but is much lower than that of the Upper Provinces. In the cold weather the temperatures of N\u00e1gpur and Calcutta again approach each other, while that of the Northern Provinces remains much colder. The Districts above the S\u00e1tpuras have a temperature more nearly approaching that of the North-Western Provinces, while the S\u00e1tpura plateau Districts have from their superior elevation a somewhat cooler climate.\n\nAs regards moisture of the atmosphere, in the spring and hot weather, from February to May, N\u00e1gpur is far below both Bengal and the Northern Provinces. In the rainy season, the moisture of N\u00e1gpur exceeds that of Northern India, but is considerably below that of Calcutta. After the rains have ceased, it again falls very rapidly to a lower point than is obtained either in Calcutta or Northern India. The mean annual rainfall of the Province is 45 inches, of which 41 inches fall in the monsoon season from June to October. This is a much higher fall than occurs in the Upper Provinces; but owing to the rapid drainage of the country, this heavy rainfall is fully required. Any considerable diminution in the quantity occasions loss of the crops and a scarcity of water in the hot weather. This does not often happen, but in 1868 a mean deficiency of 15 inches was followed by drought and famine in 1869. The arrival of the monsoon occurs with great uniformity over the whole Province, usually before the 20th June.\n\nThe Central Provinces being within the tropics, the changes in the direction of the wind, as the different seasons come round, are very regular. The north-easterly wind sets in in October, and continues steadily in this direction, or easterly, through November and the early part of December; in the latter part of that month it slackens, and southerly winds are frequent; the north-east wind, however, continues the prevailing wind till the end of January or beginning of February. In February and March the wind is variable, but southerly and south-westerly winds are more frequent. In April, the prevailing wind is north-west, and it continues from this direction until about the middle of June, when the monsoon sets in, the general direction of which is west and south-west. Westerly and north-westerly winds are the strongest; the north-east and easterly winds are generally light. A clear sky commonly accompanies the north-east and easterly winds, and their comparative dryness is shown by the rapid decrease of the relative humidity of the atmosphere in the month of November, when these winds prevail with the greatest steadiness; the wind from the north-west is, however, the driest wind. South and south-westerly winds bring clouds, and are commonly followed by electric disturbances and showers. The currents of air that traverse Central India differ considerably from those that prevail in the Ganges valley and Northern\nIndia, particularly as regards the relative frequency of winds from the south-east and east. In the Ganges valley and the North-Western Provinces, south-east and easterly winds are frequent from March till October. In this part of India, a south-easterly wind is rare at all seasons; north-easterly and easterly winds prevail in the cold weather, but after February an easterly wind never blows except for a few hours from some local atmospheric disturbance.\n\n**Chabr\u00e1mau.**\u2014Tahsil and town in Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d District, North-Western Provinces.\u2014See Chhibr\u00e1mau.\n\n**Chach.**\u2014Tract of country in Attock tahsil, R\u00e1wal Pindi District, Punjab, consisting of a fertile valley, lying along the east bank of the Indus, north of the Attock Hills. The river channel here contains numerous islands, whose herbage, naturally watered by percolation, affords pasturage for the flocks of the surrounding country. Irrigation, except from wells, is impracticable in the valley itself; but a proposal is under consideration for a canal drawing its supplies from Gh\u00e1z\u00ed in Haz\u00e1ra District. Hazro is the chief commercial and agricultural centre of the Chach valley. The population consists of Hindus and Muhammadians.\n\n**Chach\u00e1na.**\u2014Petty State of Jh\u00e1law\u00e1r in K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay Presidency; consisting of 1 village, with 1 independent tribute-payer.

No later population statistics are available to me. Distant 48 miles from Um\u00e1rkot. The municipal revenue in 1873\u201374 was \u00a3153, but the municipality was abolished in 1878 on the introduction into Sind of Bombay Act vi. of 1873. Head-quarters of mukhti\u00e1rk\u00e1r, with civil and criminal courts.

Estimated area of the whole, 440 square miles; population, exclusive of S\u00e1ntalpur, (1881) 5330, consisting of 2803 males and 2527 females; of these, Hindus number 5097; Muhammadians, 168; \u2018others,\u2019 65. The ruling family are Jharej\u00e1 R\u00e1jputs, related to the R\u00e1o of Cutch (Kachchh), and follow the rule of primo-geniture. They hold the rank of th\u00e1kurs. Estimated revenue (with S\u00e1ntalpur) in 1881, \u00a33360. The country is flat and open. There\nare three different kinds of soil\u2014clayey, sandy, and black. Only one crop of the common grains is produced during the year. Salt is obtained in considerable quantities. There are no rivers, but numerous tanks, which in ordinary seasons retain water till March, when the inhabitants depend on their wells. Water is found from 5 to 20 feet deep.\u2014See also Santalpur.\n\nCh\u00e1gdah.\u2014Town in Nadiy\u00e1 District, Bengal; situated on the left bank of the H\u00fagli. Station on the Eastern Bengal Railway, 38\u00bd miles from Calcutta. Population (1881) 8989, namely, 6343 Hindus and 2646 Muhammadans; area of town site, 2500 acres.

Chief mart of the jute export trade, giving its name to the fibre grown throughout the District. The river here is considered sacred; and on certain festivals, Hindus flock to Ch\u00e1gdah to wash away their sins in its water.\n\nCh\u00e1ib\u00e1s\u00e1.\u2014Chief town and administrative head-quarters of Singbh\u00fam District, Bengal; situated on rising ground overlooking the right bank of the river Roro, and commanding a pleasant view. Lat. 22\u00b0 32' 50\" N., long. 83\u00b0 50' 57\" E.; population (1881) 6006, namely, 5120 Hindus, 778 Muhammadans, and 108 'others;' area of town site, 640 acres; number of houses, 1052, mostly built of mud or sunburnt bricks. Municipal income in 1881\u201382, \u00a3274, equal to an average taxation of 8\u00bdd. per head of the population within municipal limits. Besides the Deputy-Commissioner's residence and the ordinary Government buildings, there are a few masonry houses, forming a short street, belonging to grain and cloth merchants. Jail, police station, post-office, Government English school, charitable dispensary. A large fair, attended by 20,000 visitors from all parts of Singbh\u00fam, is held annually at Christmas time; on the last day of the year, races, national dances, and athletic sports take place. Ch\u00e1ib\u00e1s\u00e1 is the only place in the District which has permanent shops, occupied by dealers in tasar silk cocoons, cloth, and grain.\n\nCh\u00e1\u00ednpur.\u2014Town in Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Bengal; situated 7 miles west of Bhabua.

In 1750, Sh\u00e1hnav\u00e1z Kh\u00e1n took refuge in it, but in the following year the French were in possession. Again seized by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, the French recaptured it in 1757. Three years later, it fell to the British, after the battle of W\u00e1ndiwash. In 1782, Haidar Al\u00ed fought under its walls a drawn battle with the British troops; and in the following year, by the treaty with the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, the place was given up in exchange for Cumbum in the B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t. As first constructed, this fort measured 540 yards by 430, and was defended by 14 towers.\n\nChak.\u2014Town in Sakkar t\u00e1l\u00fck, Shik\u00e1rpur District, Sind, Bombay Presidency. Population (1872) 1258, of whom 801 were Muhammadans (chiefly Sit\u00e1rs and Mah\u00e1rs), and 457 Hindus (principally Br\u00e1hmans and Loh\u00e1\u00f1os).

Length from north-west to south-east, 21 miles; greatest breadth, 10 miles; total area, about 150 square miles in the rains, and 20 square miles during the dry season. It is a depressed basin, sunk below the level of the surrounding country, except at the southern extremity, from which its waters are discharged. Principal feeders, the Gur and Nand\u00e1kuj\u00e1, both navigable streams. In the dry season, the average depth of the area covered with water is 3 feet, but a tortuous navigable channel runs through it, with a depth of from 6 to 12 feet all the year round. The lake abounds in fish and water-fowl. The neighbouring swamps are said to be a permanent seed-bed for the dissemination of endemic cholera.\n\nChal\u00e1uni.\u2014River in Bh\u00e1galpur District, Bengal. Rises in a marsh in pargan\u00e1 Har\u00e1wat, enters pargan\u00e1 N\u00e1rdigar at Thalla Garhi village, and after a rather tortuous course falls into the Loran at Pandu\u00e1. It is not used for irrigation, and is too shallow for boat traffic. Rice is grown in many parts of its bed.\n\nCh\u00e1lisg\u00e1on.\u2014Sub-division of Kh\u00e1ndesh District, Bombay Presidency. Area, 504 square miles; contains 132 villages. Population (1881) 59,031 persons, or 30,808 males and 28,223 females. Hindus number 50,369; Muhammadans, 4571; 'others,' 4091. The Sub-division is situated in the extreme south of the District at the foot of the S\u00e1tm\u00e1la range, which, running east and west in a wall-like line, separate Kh\u00e1ndesh from the Deccan uplands. Watered by the Girna river, which flows from west to east through the northern villages, and by its tributaries the Many\u00e1d and the Titur, which in their turn are fed by several minor streams. Besides these, and the J\u00e1mda canal, water is afforded by 2000 wells. The soil is mixed, much of it towards the south, south-west, and north being hard and stony. The black soil of the Girna valley, though better than in the surrounding parts, is generally faulty, as it rests on a subsoil either of gravel or rock. Cultivated area (1878\u201379), 134,265 acres, of which grain crops occupied 83,202 acres, or 61.97 per cent.; oil-seeds, 17,209 acres, or 12.81 per cent.; fibres, 30,640 acres, or 22.82 per cent.; the remainder being\nunder miscellaneous crops, such as sugar-cane, chillies, tobacco, etc. The Sub-division contains 2 criminal courts and 1 police station (th\u00e1n\u00e1); strength of regular police, 74 men; village watchmen (chauki-d\u00e1rs), 115.\n\nCh\u00e1lisg\u00e1on.\u2014Town in Kh\u00e1ndesh District, Bombay Presidency, and head-quarters of Ch\u00e1lisg\u00e1on Sub-division. Station on the Great India Peninsula Railway, 30 miles south of Dhuli\u00e1 town, with which it is connected by a fine, partly-bridged road. The town is of little importance, except as being the head-quarters of a Sub-division, although its trade has much increased since the opening of the railway. Population (1872) 3941. No later population statistics are available to me.\n\nCham\u00e1rdi.\u2014Petty State of Gohelw\u00e1r, District of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Guj\u00e1r\u00e1t (Guzer\u00e1t) Province, Bombay Presidency. It consists of one village, with three independent tribute-payers. Estimated revenue in 1881, \u00a3900, from which \u00a376, 10s. is paid as tribute to the Gaekw\u00e1r, and \u00a39 to Jun\u00e1garh.\n\nCh\u00e1marl\u00e1kota (S\u00e1mulkota).\u2014Town in God\u00e1var\u00ed District, Madras Presidency; situated in lat. 17\u00b0 3' 10\" N., and long. 82\u00b0 12' 50\" E., 7 miles north of Cocon\u00e1da. Population (1881) 4961, namely, 4401 Hindus, 546 Muhammadans, and 14 Christians. It was formerly a military station, but was abandoned in January 1869. The barracks, first built in 1786, still remain. Ch\u00e1marl\u00e1kota is connected by canals with R\u00e1j\u00e1mahendri (Rajahmundry) and Cocon\u00e1da. Station of a Lutheran Church Mission.\n\nChamba.\u2014One of the Punjab Hill States under the Government of the Punjab. A mountainous tract lying to the north of K\u00e1ngra and G\u00far\u0111aspur Districts, between 32\u00b0 10' 30\" and 33\u00b0 13' 0\" N. lat., and between 75\u00b0 49' 0\" and 77\u00b0 3' 30\" E. long.; shut in on almost every side by lofty hill ranges. Bounded on the north-west and west by the territories of Kashmir, on the east and north-east by British L\u00e1h\u00fal and Lad\u00e1kh, and on the south and south-east by the Districts of K\u00e1ngra and G\u00far\u0111aspur. Estimated area, 3180 square miles. Population (1881) 115,773. The R\u00e1jputs, to which caste the chief belongs, are few in number, and only inhabit the valleys on the outer slopes of the Him\u00e1layas. In Barm\u00e1or, and in the tracts bordering on the British parg\u00e1ns of N\u00farpur in K\u00e1ngra and Pat\u00e1nkot in G\u00far\u0111aspur, there is a considerable Br\u00e1hman population of a simple and even primitive type engaged in agriculture, and as shepherds in the winter months, who are strangers to the elaborate Hinduism of the plains, and are looked up to by their neighbours not so much on religious grounds as because of their purity of race. Associated with these is a class of Khattris, who are believed to be degenerate Br\u00e1hmans; they engage in agriculture and trade, and the military and civil service of\nthe State is principally recruited from their number. They differ from the Khattris of the plains both in appearance and habits. Kanets are found as cultivators in the neighbourhood of the Kangra border, but seldom as owners of the soil. The Takkars are a distinct and apparently intrusive race, of possibly Turanian origin, who are owners and cultivators on the outer slopes of the hills, especially towards Dalhousie, where they also take service as jhamp\u00e1n bearers, watchmen, coolies, etc.\n\nThe women of all classes, Br\u00e1hmans not excepted, take an important part in field labour, which consists chiefly in the making and maintaining of cultivation terraces retained by masonry walls. Classified according to religion, the State contains 108,377 Hindus, 6859 Muhammadans, 385 Buddhists, 72 Sikhs, and 80 Christians. Number of villages, 365; average density of population, 36 per square mile. Two ranges of snowy peaks and glaciers run through the State; one through the centre, dividing the valleys of the R\u00e1vi and the Chen\u00e1b; the other along the borders of Lad\u00e1kh and British L\u00e1hul; to the west and south stretch fertile valleys.\n\nTwo of the five great Punjab rivers water the State, flowing through forests which are important sources of timber supply for the railways and other public works in the Punjab. The forests are leased to the British Government, and yield timber that brings in from \u00a310,000 to \u00a320,000 a year. The spring crops consist of wheat and barley; and the autumn crops of Indian corn, rice, and inferior millets. Hops have been successfully grown, and in course of time are expected to form an important article of export. The other exports are drugs, dye-stuffs, carraway seeds, walnuts, pine-nuts, honey, wool, gh\u00ed, and pheasant skins. In the summer months an annual immigration of turbulent Musalm\u00e1n Guj\u00e1rs from Jammu takes place, who graze their buffaloes and milch cows chiefly on the Dain-Kund range, which lies behind the sanitarium of Dalhousie. It is estimated that in the summer months from five to six hundred thousand sheep and goats, and from eight to ten thousand buffaloes and kine, find grazing on the Chamba mountains. Iron-ore is plentiful, and the mines are regularly worked, yielding sufficient for the wants of the people. Copper is also found. Slate quarries exist all over the State, especially in the neighbourhood of the sanitarium of Dalhousie. The soil and climate are suitable for the cultivation of tea. Chamba is a favourite resort of sportsmen, and the mountain ranges abound with game, comprising the sloth and yellow bears, hill leopards, hara-singha, wild sheep, ghurd\u00edl, ibex (ban-bakri), and kakar (barking deer). The musk deer (kastura) is found in the Barm\u00e1or tract, but the custom of the country prohibits its being killed as game. The y\u00e1k or Tibetan ox (chimwar) is said to be found wild on the borders of Chamba and Lahil. Among birds, the chikor (red-legged partridge), snow partridge, and five species\nof pheasants are found, two of which yield a revenue of some \u00a3400 a year for their skins. Eight passes connect Chamba proper with Pangi and Chamba L\u00e1hul. The rivers are all well bridged, and there are more than 300 miles of good roadways. A portion of the Central Asian trade passes through Chamba. Cloth, cutlery, oil, leather, and spices are exported to Lad\u00e1kh, Yarkand, and Turkist\u00e1n. The imports are chiefly charas (a narcotic preparation of hemp), pashmina, carpets, and brick tea, consigned to the markets of North-Western India, especially Amritsar.\n\nThe ruling family of Chamba claims to be of Kshattriy\u00e1 descent. The present R\u00e1j\u00e1, Sh\u00e1m Singh, was born in July 1866, and the administration of the State is carried on during his minority by a British officer in concert with native officials. The results have been very beneficial to the State, the revenue rising in eight years from \u00a312,000 to \u00a317,300. By 1874\u201375 it had further increased to about \u00a319,000, and by 1882 to \u00a324,000, exclusive of \u00a35000 representing revenue-free grants. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 ranks 15th on the list of Punjab chiefs, and is entitled to a salute of 11 guns. His military force consists of 1 gun, and 160 military and police. Chamba is an ancient Hindu principality, and came into British possession in 1846. A part was at first made over to the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 of Kashm\u00edr; but, by agreement in 1847, it came again entirely under the British Government, and a sanad was given to the R\u00e1j\u00e1, assigning the territory to him and to his male heirs, who are entitled to inherit according to Hindu law; and on failure of direct issue, to the heirs of the brothers according to seniority. The late chief, R\u00e1j\u00e1 Gop\u00e1l Singh, having by misconduct incurred the displeasure of the British Government, was in 1873 required to abdicate. The internal administration is still largely modelled on the ancient pattern of Northern Indian societies. The revenue is collected by a resident agent, who represents the subjects towards the State, but collects the share of customs duties for the R\u00e1j\u00e1. He is usually entitled the char, and corresponds in some respects to the lambard\u00e1r or village head-man in certain parts of British India. He has, under him, a likneh\u00e1r\u00e1 or village accountant, and a batw\u00e1l or rural constable. The purely State officials in each pargan\u00e1 are the kotw\u00e1l or magistrate; mehta or surveyor; amin or assessor; and a varying number of durbi\u00e1ls, entrusted with miscellaneous executive duties.\n\nIn 1854, the sanitarium of Dalhousie was made over to the British Government, and a remission of \u00a3200 made in the tribute. In 1867, a further remission of \u00a3500 per annum was allowed in compensation for land taken up to form the cantonments of Bakloh and Bal\u00fan, where British troops are now stationed. The tribute now paid is \u00a3500 per annum.\nChamba.\u2014Chief town in Chamba State, Punjab, and the residence of the R\u00e1j\u00e1. Lat. 32\u00b0 29' N.; long. 76\u00b0 10' E. Population in 1881, 5218, namely, Hindus, 4390; Muhammadans, 730; Sikhs, 43; and 'others,' 55.\n\nChambal (Chumbul).\u2014River of Central India, and one of the principal tributaries of the Junna (Jann\u00e1); rises in M\u00e1lw\u00e1, about 8 or 9 miles south-west of the military station of Mhow (Mau), at an elevation of 2019 feet above sea-level, amidst a cluster of summits of the Vindhya range, having the local name of Janap\u00e1r\u00e1, on the crest of the watershed which divides the great basins of the Ganges and the Narbad\u00e1 (Nerbudda). Thence it flows down the slopes of the Vindhyan range, with a general northward course, for 80 miles, receiving the waters of the Chambila, a stream of almost equal length and volume, which takes its rise in the same range. About 40 miles from its source it is crossed by the line of the R\u00e1jput\u00e1na-M\u00e1lw\u00e1 Railway at Chambal Station. At the town of T\u00e1l, 25 miles lower down, the river turns to the north-west, and, winding with a sinuous detour round the fortress of Nagatw\u00e1r\u00e1, shortly receives a second great tributary, the S\u00edpri, which also has its origin in the Vindhyan mountains. Passing by a tortuous course through the gorges of the Mokandarra Hills, the Chambal next enters the depressed tract of Har\u00e1t\u00ed (Harowtee). Previously to reaching this rugged region, it is crossed at the Gujar\u00e1t Gh\u00e1t, on the route from N\u00edmach (Neemuch) to the Mokandarra Pass, by a ford which becomes practicable after the 1st of November, while during the rains a ferry-boat is maintained for the convenience of traffic. Through the Mokandarra uplands, the Chambal glides between almost perpendicular cliffs, expanding at its 209th mile into a picturesque lake, from whose bed it escapes over a rocky barrier, by a series of magnificent cascades, the chief of which has an estimated fall of 60 feet. At the city of Kot\u00e1h, 50 miles below this picturesque scene, the Chambal is at all seasons a deep and large stream, which must be crossed by ferry, even elephants being unable to ford its shallowest part. At Paran\u00far, 31 miles from Kot\u00e1h, the road from Agra to Mhow (Mau) passes the river by a ford, its breadth varying from 300 yards in the rains to 30 yards in the dry season.\n\nAfter receiving the waters of the Kali-S\u00ednd, Parbati, and Banas, its principal confluent, the Chambal assumes the dimensions of a great river; and continuing a north-easterly course, is crossed, 45 miles farther down, by a ferry on the Gwalior and Nasir\u00e1b\u00e1d (Nusseer\u00e1b\u00e1d) road. Maintaining the same direction for 55 miles, it flows under the city of Dholpur, on its left bank, and runs through a picturesque valley, bounded by fantastic hills in every variety of outline and contour. The river here is crossed by the Sindhia State Railway from Agra to Gwalior. At length, after passing into the British District\nof Etawah, it flows in a deep bed, surrounded by wild gorges and ravines, to join the main channel of the Jumna, 40 miles below Etawah town, in lat. $26^\\circ 15' 0''$ N. and long. $79^\\circ 15' 2''$ E. Its total length, including the various windings, amounts to 650 miles; the distance in a straight line, from the source near Mhow to the junction with the Jumna, may be taken at about 330 miles. The Chambal is liable to sudden floods, and during heavy rain it discharges a greater volume of water than the Jumna itself. After the two rivers have united, the crystal current of the mountain stream may be distinguished for some distance from the muddy waters of the main river. In times of flood, communication between the two banks is often interrupted for days together, no boat being able to live in the turbulent rapids. The Chambal is identified with the Charmanwati of Sanskrit writers. The chief ferries are at Udi, Bahr\u00e1ich, Sahasw\u00e1n, and P\u00e1li. The average fall of the river may be estimated at $2\\frac{3}{4}$ feet per mile.\n\n**Ch\u00e1mbal.**\u2014Town in the head-quarters Sub-division of Chittagong District, Bengal. Population (1881) 5000, namely, 2341 males and 2659 females.\n\n**Chambra Mala.**\u2014Mountain peak in Wain\u00e1d t\u00e1luk, Malab\u00e1r District, Madras Presidency; situated 19 miles south of Manantoddy (Man\u00e1nt\u00e1di), in the richest coffee tract of the Wain\u00e1d.

Village school.\n\n**Chamomeril** (or *Iso Moriri*).\u2014Lake in Lad\u00e1kh, Kashm\u00edr State, in the elevated table-land of Rupshu, lying between the valleys of the Sutlej (Satlaj) and the Indus. Lat. $32^\\circ 55' N.$, long. $78^\\circ 15' E.$ Elevation above sea-level, 14,900 feet. Surrounded by mountains, some of which rise to a height of 5000 feet from the water's edge. The water is brackish, and not good for drinking purposes, although horses and goats drink it. Though it receives several considerable streams, it has no efflux, the level being maintained by evaporation. Length from north to south, 15 miles; breadth, from 3 to 5 miles.\n\n**Ch\u00e1mpa** (*Ch\u00e1pa*).\u2014Estate or *zam\u00edn\u00e9d\u00edri* in Bil\u00e1spur District, Central Provinces.

The chief is a Kunw\u00e1r. At Ch\u00e1mpa, his head-quarters (lat. $22^\\circ 2' 0'' N.$, long. $82^\\circ 43' 0'' E.$), dwell a considerable number of weavers, whose manufactures find a ready sale in the adjoining market of Bamnideh\u00ed.\n\n**Champah\u00e1ti.**\u2014Small village and station on the Calcutta and South-Eastern State Railway, 15 miles south-west of Calcutta, in the District of the Twenty-four Pargan\u00e1s, Bengal.\nChampanagar.\u2014Village forming the western part of Bh\u00e1galpur town, Bh\u00e1galpur District, Bengal. Contains the mausoleum of a Muhammadan saint, with an inscription bearing the date 1622-23. Residence of the puj\u00e1ris belonging to the Jain sect of Osw\u00e1l\u00eds, of whom there is a small community at Bh\u00e1galpur. The village is the headquarters of the tas\u00e1r silk manufacture in the District.\n\nChamp\u00e1ner.\u2014Hill fort and village in the District of the P\u00e1nch Mah\u00e1ls, Gujar\u00e1t (Guz\u00e9r\u00e1t), Bombay Presidency; situated on an isolated rock of great height, 250 miles north by east of Bombay, and 27 miles north-east of Baroda. Lat. 22\u00b0 31' N., long. 73\u00b0 36' E. The fortifications enclose a space about three-quarters of a mile in length by three furlongs in breadth. Within this enclosure are two forts, an upper and a lower. The upper fort, which, from its natural situation, is almost impregnable, contains a temple to the goddess K\u00e1li, of much local reputation. The lower fort, also very difficult of access, possesses some curious Hindu monuments of remote antiquity. Till late in the 15th century, the strength of this citadel preserved their territory and capital to a line of R\u00e1jput chiefs; but in 1482, Mahm\u00fad (B\u00e9g\u00e1ra), King of Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d, enraged at certain acts of aggression on the part of the ruler of Champ\u00e1ner, overran his territory, and laid siege to his stronghold. According to Hindu accounts, the upper fortress resisted all the efforts of the besiegers, and yielded only after a blockade of twelve years. Pleased with its situation, Mahm\u00fad determined to make Champ\u00e1ner his capital, and accordingly he founded a new city at some distance from the former town, adorning it with large and beautiful mosques. Muhammad\u00e1b\u00e1d Champ\u00e1ner, as it was now called, became a place of great wealth; trade soon developed; and until about 1560, the place remained the capital of the Gujar\u00e1t kings.\n\nDuring the Emperor Hum\u00e1yun\u2019s rapid conquest of Gujar\u00e1t, the fort of Champ\u00e1ner was taken in August 1535. According to local legend, the Emperor himself, with a small band of followers, climbed up by means of iron spikes driven into the face of the rock, won an entrance, and admitted the main body of his troops. On the dismemberment of the Delhi Empire in the latter part of the 18th century, Champ\u00e1ner was seized by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, and ultimately fell into the hands of Madhuji Sindhia. It was entirely neglected by his successor, D\u00e1ulat R\u00e1o Sindhia, and on the 17th September 1802, surrendered without resistance to a small British detachment under the command of Colonel Woodington. It was restored in 1803 to D\u00e1ulat R\u00e1o Sindhia by the treaty of Serji Anjang\u00e1on. Subsequently, in 1861, the town was, with the whole District of the P\u00e1nch Mah\u00e1ls, transferred to the British Government. During the 18th century, Champ\u00e1ner was deserted, and its neighbourhood has relapsed into jungle. So unhealthy, indeed, has the place become, that several attempts to colonize it have failed. Though now\nalmost without inhabitants, its magnificent hill, the fortifications, the site of the old Hindu town, and the ruins of the Musalm\u00e1n capital, still make Champ\u00e1ran a place of much interest.\n\n**Champ\u00e1ran.\u2014**District of the Patn\u00e1 Division, occupying the north-west corner of Behar, under the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal; lying between 26\u00b0 16' and 27\u00b0 30' N., and between 83\u00b0 55' and 85\u00b0 21' E. long. Total area, 3531 square miles; population, according to the Census of 1881, 1,721,608 souls. The administrative head-quarters are at the town of Motih\u00e1ri, situated in lat. 26\u00b0 39' N., and long. 84\u00b0 58' E.\n\nChamp\u00e1ran District is bounded north by the Independent State of Nep\u00e1l; east by Muzaffarpur District; south by Muzaffarpur and S\u00e1ran; and west by Gorakhpur District, in the North-Western Provinces, and by a portion of Nep\u00e1l territory called R\u00e1j Botw\u00e1l. The northern frontier, where not naturally formed by rivers, is marked by ditches and masonry pillars; for some distance it runs along the summit of the Sumeswar range. On the east, the B\u00e1ghmat\u00ed river constitutes a natural boundary with Muzaffarpur for a distance of 35 miles; and similarly the Gandak is the continuous south-western boundary from Triben\u00ed Gh\u00e1t to Sattar Gh\u00e1t. Owing to changes in the course of the Gandak, a tract of land, consisting of 35 villages, on the farther bank of the river is now arbitrarily included within the jurisdiction of Champ\u00e1ran.\n\n**History.\u2014**This tract of country has no history of its own. It was separated from S\u00e1ran, and erected into an independent District, as recently as 1866; and at the present time the judge of S\u00e1ran periodically visits Motih\u00e1ri to hold the Sessions. But though Champ\u00e1ran contains no large towns or sites that can be connected with historical events, there are local traditions and ruins of arch\u00e6ological interest that point back to a prehistoric past. The earliest remains show that Champ\u00e1ran formed an integral part of the great kingdom of Magadha, which flourished before the Christian era. At the village of Lauriy\u00e1 Navanagarh there are three rows of huge tumuli, which have been visited by General Cunningham. A small silver coin of a date anterior to the invasion of Alexander the Great, and a seal of black earthenware with an inscription in the Gupta character, have been found. From these and other indications, General Cunningham is induced to believe that the tumuli contain the graves of early kings, who lived between 1500 and 600 B.C. In the same neighbourhood stands a pillar, inscribed with the Buddhist edicts of Asoka. It is a single block of polished sandstone, 33 feet high, the diameter tapering from 35 inches at the base to 26 inches at the top. The capital supports a statue of a lion facing the north, and the abacus is ornamented with a row of Br\u00e1hmani geese. A similar column, of less graceful dimensions, is to be seen at the village of Arar\u00e1j. At Kesariy\u00e1 is a large brick mound, supporting a solid tower or st\u00fapa of the same material 62 feet high and\n68 feet in diameter, which is supposed by General Cunningham to have been erected to commemorate one of the acts of Buddha. Close by are the ruins of a small temple, and the head and shoulders of a colossal image of Buddha. Another class of remains bear witness to a later generation of kings, who are described in local legend as R\u00e1jput immigrants. Their capital was at Simr\u00e1un, on the Nep\u00e1l frontier, where there are extensive ruins of fortifications and tanks now overgrown with jungle. Tradition says that Simr\u00e1un was founded by N\u00e1nuap\u00e1 Deva in 1097 A.D.; and that the seventh and last of the royal line was driven northwards into Nep\u00e1l by the Muhammadans in 1322.\n\nThe Musalm\u00e1n sark\u00e1r of Champ\u00e1ran was considerably smaller than the present British District. In 1582, according to the rent-roll of Todar Mall, Akbar's finance minister, it was composed of three parg\u00e1ns, covering a total area of 85,711 bigh\u00e1s, and paying a gross revenue that may be computed at \u00a314,000. When the East India Company obtained possession of the diw\u00e1n\u00ed of Bengal in 1765, the area was estimated at 2546 square miles, and the revenue was \u00a334,000. The whole was settled with the sons of Jagal Kishori Singh, the owner of the Betti\u00e1 R\u00e1j, which family still owns the larger half of the soil of the District. The remainder is held principally by two other great landowners, the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of R\u00e1mnnagar on the Nep\u00e1l frontier, and the family known as the Madhubani B\u00e1bus, founded by Abdul Singh, a member of the Betti\u00e1 family. In recent times, the only historical event that has taken place in Champ\u00e1ran is connected with the Mutiny of 1857. The 12th regiment of Irregular Horse was then stationed at Segauli. The commandant, Major Holmes, expressed himself confident of the loyalty of his men. But one day in July, the sow\u00e1rs or troopers suddenly rose in mutiny, massacred their commandant, his wife and children, and all the Europeans in the cantonments. Still more recently, Champ\u00e1ran has been severely visited by the two famines of 1866 and 1874, both of which were caused by seasons of deficient rainfall. The District is peculiarly exposed to such calamities. It is backward in civilisation, has comparatively little trade or accumulated wealth; and, till the opening of the branch of the T\u00edrh\u00fat State Railway, it lay remote from the ordinary channels of communication. It has now, however, been placed in direct communication with the principal marts and seats of commerce.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014Champ\u00e1ran consists of an irregular triangle, with its apex toward the south-east. Its sides are formed by the two bordering rivers, the Gandak and the B\u00e1gmat\u00ed; its base on the north is closed by the low hills on the Nep\u00e1l frontier; while it is bisected throughout its entire length by the Buri or Old Gandak. The southern portion resembles in all respects the adjoining Districts of S\u00e1ran and Muzaffarpur, and perhaps exceeds them in fertility. The land is almost\nuniformly level, and under continuous cultivation. Towards the north the country becomes undulating and broken, until it reaches its highest elevation in the Sumeswar range, which averages 1500 feet above sea-level, the highest point being 2270 feet. In some places these hills are inaccessible to man. The character of the surface varies, being rocky and barren in some places, while in others it is studded with trees or covered with grass. At the eastern extremity of the Sumeswar range is situated the pass leading to Deogh\u00e1t in Nep\u00e1l, through which the British army successfully marched during the Gurkh\u00e1 War in 1814-15. The other principal passes are the Sumeswar, K\u00e1pan and Harlau Harh\u00e1.\n\nThe ascent to the Sumeswar pass lies up the bed of the J\u00fari P\u00e1n\u00ed river, amid romantic scenery. About 200 feet below the summit there is sufficient ground for a small sanitarium, where the temperature does not exceed 80\u00b0 F. in the hot weather, and pure water is to be found; and to which a good road might be constructed. It overlooks the Mauri valley in Nep\u00e1l; and from the summit, the enormous mountains of Diw\u00e1lagiri, Gos\u00e1inth\u00e1n, Urnap\u00farn\u00e1, and Everest are clearly visible. This northern tract is covered with forest, from which the finest timber-trees have long ago been carried away. It also contains large grass prairies, low-lying and watered by many streams, which afford pasturage to numerous herds of cattle. The large rivers, navigable throughout the year by boats of 100 maunds, are:\u2014The Gand\u00e1k, locally known as the S\u00e1lign\u00e1mi, flows southwards from Nep\u00e1l, touches on Champ\u00e1ran at Triben\u00ed gh\u00e1t in the extreme north-west, whence it flows south-westwards partly through the District, but for the most part marking its western boundary, till it leaves Champ\u00e1ran at its southwest corner. The river is reported to be navigable throughout the year by boats of about forty tons burthen, but navigation is rendered difficult, owing to the narrow and tortuous course during the hot and cold season, and to its impetuous current in the rains. The breadth of the stream is two or three miles at places during the rains, but in the cold weather the stream is rarely more than a quarter of a mile across. The river is nowhere fordable; it changes its course nearly every year, exhibiting the operations of alluvion and diluvion on a large scale. The Little Gand\u00e1k, which is known by a variety of names in different parts of its course, takes its rise in the Sumeswar hills, and flows through the centre of the District from north-west to south-east till it enters Muzaffarpur. Navigable throughout the year for the greater part of its course by boats of from 7 to 15 tons. In the dry weather it is fordable in many places, but in the rains the many hill streams which join it make it an impetuous torrent. The Baghm\u00e1ti forms part of the eastern boundary of the District for a distance of about 35 miles. Navigable by boats of 15 or 18 tons burthen for a portion of its course.\nIts current is very rapid, sometimes reaching seven miles an hour in its upper reaches, during freshes. A few days' rain causes the river to rise rapidly, and its floods inundate the country far inland. It has changed its course several times, the soil being very light and loose along its banks, which are being constantly washed away. Through the centre of the District runs a long chain of shallow lakes or jhils, 43 in number, which cover a total area of 139 square miles, and which evidently mark the former bed of a large river which has now taken another course.\n\nChamparan suffers from the effects of an irregular water-supply. Droughts are of common occurrence; in 1866, and again in 1874, they caused widespread scarcity. The District, which was formerly subject to destructive inundations from the Gandak and the B\u00e2ghmati, has been protected, so far as the floods of the former river are concerned, by an extensive embankment constructed by Government engineers. In the north, the small drainage channels or n\u00e1ld\u00e1s are inadequate to carry off the rainfall of the hills, which often lays the country under water. The natural products of the District are chiefly found in the hilly tract to the north. Gold is washed in the beds of the hill streams, and it is said that a considerable revenue was formerly derived from this source. Copper is also found in small quantities, and the discovery has been reported of a bed of coal. Building-stone exists, though it has not been utilized. A stratum of kankar or nodular limestone runs throughout the whole District; the stone is used both for metalling the roads and for burning into lime. Apart from timber and firewood, the chief jungle products are a grass called sobit\u00e1 (used for making ropes), the narkat reed (used for mats), honey and beeswax, lac, long pepper, and various medicinal plants. The forests of R\u00e1mnagar, which have been leased by the R\u00e1j\u00e1 to a European capitalist, at an annual rental of \u00a31000, are estimated to yield to the lessee a profit of ten times that amount. The total value of all the fisheries in the District is insignificant.\n\nPeople.\u2014Several early enumerations of the inhabitants exist, but not one of them can be accepted as accurate. The highest estimate, in 1869, gave a total of 932,322 souls. The first regular Census, in 1872, returned the population at 1,440,815 souls, spread over an area of 3531 square miles, or an average of 408 per square mile. In 1881, with the area of the District the same as in 1872, the Census showed that the population numbered 1,721,608, being a nominal increase of 280,793, or 19\u00bd per cent. in the nine years. A considerable proportion of the reported increase of the population, however, the Collector states is due to better enumeration in 1881 than in 1872. The male population in 1881 numbered 870,627, and the females 850,981; proportion of males in total population, 50\u00b757 per cent. Area of District, 3531 square miles;\nnumber of villages, 7766; number of houses, 293,709, of which 282,821 are occupied and 10,888 unoccupied. Average density of population, 487\u00b757 per square mile; villages per square mile, 27\u00b720; persons per village, 221; persons per occupied house, 6\u00b709. Classified according to religion the population consists of:\u2014Hindus, 1,476,985; Muhammadans, 242,687; and Christians, 1936.\n\nAmong the aboriginal population are included the Th\u00e1rus, who with the Nep\u00e1l\u00eds (although not returned separately in the Census Report) are almost entirely confined to the two frontier th\u00e1nds of Lauriy\u00e1 and Bagah\u00e1. The Th\u00e1rus are a race of Indo-Chinese origin, inhabiting the malarious tar\u00e1di along the foot of the Himalayas. They are honest and industrious people, who utilize the water of the hill streams for their scanty patches of rice cultivation. Another tribe almost peculiar to Champ\u00e1ran is the Maghya Dom, whose numbers are not given separately in the Census Report, but probably do not exceed 800 souls. They are a nomad tribe, with inveterate habits of thieving; and it has been proposed to break up their organization by special police measures. An attempt was made in 1882 to induce these Doms to settle down in a small colony, and was so far successful that in 1883 about 250 Doms were settled in the northern half of the District, under the supervision of the magistrate and police authorities. They are reported to be living an orderly life like their neighbours, subsisting by the cultivation of their fields, in basket-weaving, or as day-labourers, etc. The Gonds, an aboriginal tribe, are returned at 11,055, out of a total aboriginal population of various tribes and castes of 40,949.\n\nThe superior castes of Hindus are well represented. The Br\u00e1hmans, who are specially encouraged to settle on the Betti\u00e1 estate, number 76,284; the R\u00e1jputs, 80,764; the B\u00e1bhans or military Br\u00e1hmans, to which caste the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Betti\u00e1 himself belongs, 42,280. Of the S\u00fadra castes, the most respectable are the K\u00e1yasth, or writer caste, who form the majority of subordinate Government officers, 28,411 in number; Baniy\u00e1, or traders, 25,821; Napit, barbers, 21,109; Loh\u00e1r, blacksmiths, 26,911; Kumbh\u00e1r, potters, 18,807; Kurm\u00ed, 88,721, and Koer\u00ed, 103,893, the two chief cultivating castes; Kandu, confectioners, 66,563; Barui, growers of the betel plant, 10,455; Go\u00e1l\u00e1, herdsmen, the most numerous caste in the District, who bear a bad reputation for honesty, 169,274; Kah\u00e1r, domestic servants and palanquin-bearers, 19,430; Dh\u00f3bi, washermen, 17,892; Son\u00e1r, goldsmiths, 14,990; T\u00e1twa, weavers, 24,319; Tel\u00ed, trades and oil-sellers, 52,842; and Mallas, boatmen, 55,411. The lowest castes, or semi-Hinduized aborigines, comprise:\u2014Nuniy\u00e1, saltpetre makers by hereditary occupation, who also supply the best labourers and spades-men to be found in the District, 45,324; Kalwar, spirit-sellers, 30,357;\nand the cognate degraded castes of Cham\u00e1rs, 112,789; Dos\u00e1dh, 81,961; Musahar, 37,913; Bind, 23,569; and Dh\u00e1nuk, 15,235. The number of Hindus not recognising caste was returned at 3051, of whom 2345 were Vaishnavs. Many of the Musalm\u00e1ns are immigrants from Patn\u00e1 and the North-Western Provinces. By sect, they are divided into 209,398 Shi\u00e1s and 1326 Sunnis.\n\nThe Christians include 1814 native converts, under the charge of two Roman Catholic missions at Bett\u00ed\u00e1 and Chuh\u00e1ri. The former was founded in 1746 by an Italian priest, who had been invited into the District by the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Bett\u00ed\u00e1. The Chuh\u00e1ri mission was established in 1770 by three priests who had been expelled from Nep\u00e1l. The mission represents all that is now left of the famous Tibetan Mission which so greatly excited the interest of Europe in the last century, with its wonderful accounts of Lh\u00e1ssa and its Grand L\u00e1mas.\n\nThe population of Champ\u00e1ran is entirely rural. The villages are somewhat larger than in the rest of Behar, but this is no indication of a tendency towards urban life. The largest town is Bett\u00ed\u00e1, with a population of 21,263. Motih\u00e1ri, the civil station, has 10,307 inhabitants. The other towns containing upwards of 5000 inhabitants, are Madhubani, with 7025; and Kesariya, with 5256. Segauli, about 15 miles from Motih\u00e1ri, the scene of the Mutiny of 1857, is still occupied by a regiment of native cavalry. Large fairs for religious objects and for trade are held annually at Bett\u00ed\u00e1, Sitakund, Araraj, and Tribeni Ghat. The chief centres of trade are Bett\u00ed\u00e1, Champattia, and Bagah\u00e1, on the Gandak. Of the 7766 towns and villages comprising the District, 5004 are returned as containing less than 200 inhabitants; 2048 from 200 to 500; 593 from 500 to 1000; 107 from 1000 to 2000; 7 from 2000 to 3000; 3 from 3000 to 5000; 2 from 5000 to 10,000; 1 from 10,000 to 15,000; and 1 upwards of 50,000 inhabitants. The primitive organization of village officials is represented at the present day by the j\u00e9th rayat or head-man and the patw\u00e1ri or accountant. Both these, however, have now become servants of the zamind\u00e1r rather than officials of the community.\n\nThe people of the District are, as a rule, badly off. The whole agricultural population is in debt to the mah\u00e1j\u00e1n, or village money-lender, who has advanced money or grain on the security of the next crop. Though rents are low, and the produce of the land good, the cultivators are in constant difficulties, partly through this system of mortgaging their future crops, and partly from improvidence. The droughts and floods to which the District is liable, render matters worse; and Champ\u00e1ran, with one of the most fertile soils in Behar, is probably the poorest District in that Province. The influence of the few great proprietors, who practically own the entire District, the general ignorance of the peasantry, the system of rack-renting and short\nleases, have all combined to hinder the cultivator from acquiring any permanent interest in the soil. To the general rule of poverty, however, the Tharus form a marked exception. They cultivate with great care the fertile tarai or sub-montane lands in the north of R\u00e1mnagar pargan\u00e1; and their general prudence and foresight have raised them far above all other castes in Champ\u00e1ran. During the famine of 1874, not one of them came to the relief works; and they then asserted that they had sufficient rice in store for six months' consumption.\n\nClassified according to occupation, the Census Report returns the male inhabitants under the six following main divisions:\u2014(1) Professional class, including Government officials and the learned professions, 10,671; (2) domestic servants, etc., 20,888; (3) commercial class, including merchants, general dealers, carriers, etc., 21,474; (4) agricultural and pastoral class, including gardeners, 346,453; (5) manufacturing, artisan, and other industrial classes, 46,641; (6) indefinite and non-productive (comprising 86,400 general labourers and 338,100 'unspecified,' including children), 424,500.\n\nAntiquities.\u2014Champ\u00e1ran abounds in places of historical interest, many dating back to a period anterior to the Christian era. Simr\u00e1un, now in ruins, is situated partly in British and partly in Nep\u00e1l territory, the frontier line passing through the walls. The ruins are in the form of a square, surrounded by an outer and an inner wall, the former being 14, and the latter 10 miles in circumference. On the east side, six or seven ditches can still be traced between the walls, and three or four on the west side. Inside are the remains of massive buildings, and of a large tank, measuring 333 yards by 210. Its sides are composed of the finest burnt bricks, each a cubit square and a maund (80 lbs.) in weight. The remains of palaces and temples disclose some finely-carved basements, with a superstructure of beautiful bricks. The citadel is situated to the north, and the palace in the centre; but both only exist as tumuli from 20 to 25 feet high, covered with trees and jungle. Tradition says that Simr\u00e1un was founded by N\u00e1nuap\u00e1 Deva A.D. 1097. Six of his dynasty reigned with much splendour, but the last of the line, Hari Singh Deo, was driven out in 1322 or 1323 by the Muhammadans.\n\nTwo miles to the south of Kesariy\u00e1 police station, stands a lofty brick mound, 1,400 feet in circumference, capped by a solid brick tower, 62 feet in height. General Cunningham assigns the date of this tower to between 200 and 700 A.D., and concludes that it was built on the top of a much older and larger stupa. About a mile north-north-east of this tower, is a low mound with the walls of a small temple 10 feet square, containing the head and shoulders of a colossal figure of Buddha. This is supposed to have been the site of a monastery, as the remains of cells are still visible. At Araraj, about\n20 miles north-west of Kesariy\u00e1, is a lofty stone pillar, bearing in well-cut and well-preserved letters several of Asoka's edicts. The pillar consists of a single block of polished sandstone 36\u00bd feet high, with a diameter at the base of 41'8 inches, and 37'6 inches at the top. At Lauri\u00e1 Navandgarh or Mathya, about 15 miles north-west of Betti\u00e1, are some very extensive remains, consisting of three rows of earthen barrows or huge conical mounds. General Cunningham considers them to be sepulchral mounds of early kings before Buddhism arose, and assigns their date to a period between 1500 and 600 B.C. A short distance from these barrows stands the lion pillar of Lauriya Navandgarh, consisting of a single block of polished sandstone, 32 feet 9 inches high, with a top diameter of 26'2 inches, and a base diameter of 35\u00bd inches. The capital is bell-shaped, with a circular abacus, supporting a statue of a lion. The column is much thinner and lighter than that at Araraj, and contains the edicts of Asoka beautifully inscribed, as well as some unimportant inscriptions in modern N\u00e1gari. The pillar is now worshipped as a phallus, and is commonly known as Bh\u00edm Singh's lathi or club.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014The crops in Champ\u00e1ran are divided into three harvests, named after the season of the year in which they are reaped\u2014(1) the bhada\u00ed or autumn crop; (2) the agh\u00e1n\u00ed or autumn crop; (3) the rabi or spring crop. The total cultivated area is pretty equally distributed between the three. Rice may be either a bhada\u00ed or an agh\u00e1n\u00ed crop, but more usually the latter. In the former case, it is grown on comparatively high lands; in the latter case in low-lying fields. The cultivation of rice is chiefly confined to the tract lying north of the Little Gandak river, and it has been estimated that only about one-third of the population habitually use rice as their daily food. In the remainder of the District the food-supply is drawn from the bhada\u00ed and rabi crops, which include barley, wheat, Indian corn, and various millets and pulses. The miscellaneous crops not grown for food, are indigo, oil-seeds, opium, tobacco, and sugar-cane. In Champ\u00e1ran, indigo is generally grown under the as\u00e1miw\u00e1r system; in accordance with which the planter takes a lease of an entire village from the zamind\u00e1r, and the cultivators are required to plant indigo on receiving an advance. There are altogether 12 head factories in the District, with 24 outworks, cultivating about 60,000 acres, but holding leases of villages, the area of which cannot be less than half a million of acres. In 1872, which was an average season, the out-turn was about 8000 cwts., valued at \u00a3264,000. In 1882\u201383, the actual out-turn was 11,962 cwts., and the estimated out-turn for the following year, 11,000 cwts. As elsewhere throughout Behar, opium is cultivated on a system of advances made by the Government. In 1872\u201373, the total area under opium was about 59,000 acres, and the out-turn\nabout 6000 cwts. The cultivation of sugar-cane is said to have been introduced from Gorakhpur in the beginning of the present century. Manure, in the shape of cow-dung and sit or indigo refuse, is used for special crops, such as sugar-cane, tobacco, opium, and indigo.\n\nIrrigation is commonly practised in the north of the District, especially by the Th\u00e1rus, who lead the water to their fields from the hill streams by artificial channels sometimes several miles in length. In the south of the District wells are occasionally dug for purposes of irrigation. Tanks are extremely rare. An elaborate scheme for utilizing the destructive flood-waters of the Gandak has long been under the consideration of Government. Almost the entire soil of Champ\u00e1ran is in the hands of three large landowners, who usually farm out their estates on short leases to middlemen, and the rent is frequently paid in kind. Though rents are not high, as compared with the neighbouring Districts, this system is unfavourable to the independence of the cultivators, who are described as being in poor circumstances. Owing to a succession of excellent harvests of late years, the cultivators are now (1883) in better circumstances than at any period during the past twenty years. The Koer\u00eds and Kurmi\u00eds are skilled agriculturists, and capable of managing large holdings; higher rents are taken from them than from the favoured castes of Br\u00e1hmans, R\u00e1jputs, and B\u00e1bhans. The average rent of land on which food-crops are raised varies from 3s. to 6s. per acre. A large extent of waste land is still available for tillage in the central and north-western parts of the District.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014Champ\u00e1ran is exceptionally exposed to natural calamities. The famines of 1866 and 1874, caused by drought, produced great and general distress in this District. In each case, also, the end of the drought was attended by destructive floods. The calamity of drought can only be remedied by encouraging facilities for importation, which will be provided by the Betti\u00e1 branch of the Tirh\u00fat State Railway. The mischief caused by floods, though equally overwhelming as that caused by drought, is not so extensive in its area, and the embankment along the left bank of the Gandak will effectually protect the low-lying fields. Famine rates are reached when rice sells in the beginning of the year at 12s. per cwt. But it must be recollected that the majority of the people do not eat rice, but depend upon barley and inferior grains.\n\nIndustrial.\u2014There are altogether 26 lines of road in Champ\u00e1ran, with an aggregate length of 438 miles. In the year 1874\u201375, a total sum of \u00a38252 was expended by the District Road Committee. External commerce is chiefly conducted by the rivers, which lend themselves more easily to export than to import. The Tirh\u00fat State Railway from Muzaffarpur to Betti\u00e1, through Motfh\u00e1ri, now (1883) nearly ready to be opened, will place the District in direct connection with the main channels of\ncommunication. The indigenous manufactures are confined to the weaving of coarse cotton cloth and blankets, and the making of pottery. The preparation of indigo is almost entirely conducted by European capital and under European supervision. The industry of sugar-refining has been introduced from the neighbouring District of Gorakhpur within the present century. Saliferous earth is found in all parts of the District; and from this a special caste, called Nuniy\u00e1s, earn a scanty livelihood by extracting saltpetre and other saline substances, including a considerable quantity of untaxed salt. Apart from its local trade in agricultural products, Champ\u00e1ran possesses commercial importance as occupying the high road between Patn\u00e1 and Nep\u00e1l. Both the local and through traffic of the District, so far as it did not escape registration, is included in the following totals, which refer to the year 1876-77:\n\nExports, \u00a3543,000, chiefly indigo \u00a3245,000, oil-seeds \u00a3120,000, timber \u00a338,000, sugar \u00a317,000, and cotton goods \u00a330,000, which last are despatched northwards into Nep\u00e1l; imports, \u00a3139,000, chiefly salt \u00a339,000, piece-goods \u00a313,000, and food-grains \u00a320,000, received from Nep\u00e1l. The principal river marts are Betti\u00e1, Gobindganj, Bagah\u00e1, Barharw\u00e1, P\u00e1kri, and M\u00e1npur. The greater portion of the trade with Nep\u00e1l crosses the frontier at Katkanw\u00e1.\n\nAdministration.\u2014Champ\u00e1ran was separated from S\u00e1ran, and erected into an independent District, in 1866. In 1870-71, the revenue amounted to \u00a382,212, of which \u00a350,030 was derived from the land; the expenditure was \u00a357,779, including \u00a323,749 on account of military payments, thus leaving a net surplus of \u00a324,433. In 1881-82, the total revenue amounted to \u00a386,301, of which \u00a351,269 was on account of land-tax. In 1881-82, the regular police consisted of a force of 341 men of all ranks, of whom 40 were employed in town or municipal duty, maintained at a total cost of \u00a34843, and a village watch of 2363 men, who received emoluments in money or land from the landowners to the estimated value of \u00a36227. The total force, therefore, for the protection of person and property numbered 2704 officers and men, being 1 man to every 1'30 square mile or to every 637 persons in the population. The estimated aggregate cost was \u00a311,070, equal to an average of \u00a34, 1s. 10\u00bdd. per square mile and 1\u00bdd. per head of population. There is a jail at the civil station of Motih\u00e1ri, with a subordinate lock-up at Betti\u00e1. In the year 1881, the daily average number of prisoners was 420, being 1 prisoner to every 4099 of the population. The Motih\u00e1ri jail has a bad reputation for its excessive unhealthiness, and a new prison is now (1883) in course of construction.\n\nEducation in this remote District has hitherto been in a backward condition. It is only since the introduction of Sir G. Campbell\u2019s reforms, by which the benefit of the grant-in-aid rules has been extended\nto the village schools or p\u0101ths\u0101l\u0101s, that primary instruction has had any existence in Champ\u00e1ran. In 1870\u201371, there were only 2 schools in the District, attended by 51 pupils. In 1872\u201373, after the reforms above mentioned had come into operation, the number of schools increased to 78, and the number of pupils to 1222. By the 31st March 1875, the schools had further increased to 182, and the pupils to 3805. The greatest increase has taken place since that date; and in 1881\u201382 there were 36 upper primary schools, attended by 1261 scholars, and 930 lower primary schools, with 7576 pupils; total, 966 schools, attended on the 31st March 1882 by 8837 pupils.\n\nFor administrative purposes, Champ\u00e1ran District is divided into 2 Sub-divisions and into 10 th\u00e1n\u00e1s or police circles. There are 4 pargan\u00e1s or fiscal divisions; but one of these, pargan\u00e1 Majhaw\u00e1, which includes the Bett\u00ed\u00e1 R\u00e1j, the R\u00e1mnagar estate, and the greater part of the Madhubani estate, covers an area of 1\u00bd million acres, and for fiscal purposes is divided into 25 tapp\u00e1s or minor revenue areas. In 1881\u201382 there were 7 magisterial and 3 civil courts open, and 2 covenanted civil servants stationed in the District. The two towns of Motih\u00e1ri and Bett\u00ed\u00e1, with an aggregate population of 31,570 souls, had in 1881\u201382 a total municipal income of \u00a31249; average rate of taxation, 10d. per head.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate of Champ\u00e1ran is described as comparatively cool and dry. The rainy season lasts from June to September. The hottest month of the year is May, at which time hot winds from the west frequently prevail. The cold weather lasts from November to March. The nights are then cold and bracing, and light winds blow. The annual rainfall at Motih\u00e1ri town for the 23 years ending 1881 was 47'92 inches. In the latter year, 57'06 inches fell, or 9'14 inches above the average.\n\nEndemic diseases of a malarious origin prevail, especially in the north of the District. In R\u00e1mnagar, intermittent fever assumes its most fatal type. Goitre, with its attendant cretinism, is common. Cholera is rarely absent from some part of the District, and outbreaks of small-pox are not infrequent.

Also the Bengal Census Report for 1881, and the Provincial Administration Reports for the years 1880 to 1883.]\n\nChamp\u00e1ran.\u2014Head-quarters Sub-division of Champ\u00e1ran District, Bengal. Area, 1518 square miles, with 4594 villages and 159,475 houses, of which 153,842 are occupied and 5633 unoccupied. Population (1881) \u2014 Hindus, 879,812; Muhammadans, 137,633; and Christians, 111: total, 1,017,556, viz. 513,113 males and 504,443 females. Average density of population, 670 per square mile; houses\nper square mile, 105; persons per village, 753; persons per occupied house, 6\u00b761. The Sub-division consists of the police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s) of Motih\u00e1ri, Ad\u00e1pur, Dh\u00e1k\u00e1 R\u00e1mchandra, Kesariy\u00e1, Madhuban, and Gobindganj. In 1882, it contained 1 civil and 3 criminal courts; with a regular police force of 215 officers and men, and 1173 chaukid\u00e1rs or village watchmen.\n\n**Champd\u00e1n\u00ed.**\u2014Small village in H\u00fagl\u00ed District, Bengal; situated on the right bank of the H\u00fagl\u00ed river, near Baidyb\u00e1ti. In former times, notorious for piracies and murders.\n\n**Ch\u00e1mr\u00e1jnagar.**\u2014T\u00e1luk in Mysore District, Mysore State. Area, 208 square miles; population (1881) 80,550, viz. males 38,911, and females 41,639. Hindus numbered 78,764; Muhammadans, 1778; and Christians, 8. Land revenue (1874\u201375), exclusive of water-rates, \u00a312,222, or 2s. 1d. per cultivated acre. There is much black cotton-soil, growing wheat, etc.\n\n**Ch\u00e1mr\u00e1jnagar.**\u2014Town in Mysore District, Mysore State, and headquarters of the t\u00e1luk of the same name; 36 miles south-east from Mysore town. Lat. 11\u00b0 56' 15\" N., long. 77\u00b0 E.; population (1881) 4123, of whom 2 are Christians. Original name (Arkotar) changed by the late Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja of Mysore in 1818, in honour of his father Ch\u00e1mr\u00e1j Wodey\u00e1r, who was born here. In 1825, the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja erected a large temple to Ch\u00e1mr\u00e1jeswara, which he endowed with sarvam\u00e1nya villages, yielding \u00a31700 a year, and placed in charge of an amild\u00e1r with 157 subordinates. He also built a palace. Two miles east are the ruins of an ancient city, locally known as Manipur.\n\n**Chamr\u00e1uli.**\u2014Town in Un\u00e1o District, Oudh; situated 7 miles east of Un\u00e1o town. Founded by the Dikhit Kshattriy\u00e1s, and the seat of their power for many generations. Still one of the chief Dikhit villages. Population (1881) 2704, namely, Hindus, 2482; Muhammadans, 222. Government school. Large village. Grain market. Two old Sivaite temples.\n\n**Cham\u00fandibetta** (the hill of Cham\u00fandi, a name for K\u00e1li, the consort of Siva).\u2014Precipitous hill in Mysore District, Mysore State; 2 miles south-east of the fort of Mysore, 3489 feet above sea-level. Lat. 12\u00b0 17' N., long. 76\u00b0 44' E. A road for wheel traffic, 5\u00bd miles in length, opened in 1877\u201378, leads to the summit, on which is a temple of Cham\u00fandi, repaired by the late Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja. Human sacrifices were offered here until the time of Haidar \u00c1li. Two-thirds of the way up is a colossal figure of Nandi, the sacred bull of Siva, hewn out of the solid rock. The figure is in a recumbent attitude, 16 feet high, and very correctly represented. It was carved by order of Dodda Deva R\u00e1j\u00e1, who ascended the throne of Mysore in 1659.\n\n**Ch\u00e1mursi.**\u2014Town in M\u00fal tahs\u00edl, Ch\u00e1nda District, Central Provinces, situated near the left bank of the Waingang\u00e1. Population (1881) 3480,\nnamely, Hindus, 3244; Muhammadans, 80; and tribes professing aboriginal religions, 156. Trade in castor seed with the Niz\u00e1m's territory; and in gh\u00ed, silk cocoons, and thread with the east coast. Weekly market, post-office, and school.\n\n**Chan\u00e1r (Chunar).\u2014Tahsil** of M\u00edrz\u00e1pur District, North-Western Provinces, lying along the south bank of the Ganges, and consisting in large part of the last outlying terraces which descend from the Vindhyan range. Area, 558 square miles, of which 244 are cultivated; population (1881) 182,654; land revenue, \u00a328,665; total revenue, \u00a330,320; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a359,042. In 1883, the Sub-division contained 1 criminal court and 7 police stations (th\u00e1n\u00e1s); strength of regular police, 79 men; village watchmen, 381.\n\n**Chan\u00e1r.**\u2014Fortress and ancient town in M\u00edrz\u00e1pur District, North-Western Provinces. Situated in lat. 25\u00b0 7' 30\" N., and long. 82\u00b0 55' 1\" E., on the south bank of the Ganges, at the point where the river takes its great bend northward towards Benares. Distant from Benares 26 miles south-west, from M\u00edrz\u00e1pur 20 miles east. Population (1881) 9148, namely, 6667 Hindus, 2386 Musalm\u00e1ns, 51 Christians, and 44 'others;' area of town site, 211 acres. Municipal income (1881) \u00a3710.\n\nThe fort of Chan\u00e1r is built upon an outlier of the Vindhyan range\u2014a sandstone rock jutting into the Ganges, and deflecting the river to the north. It lies nearly north and south, 800 yards in length, 133 to 300 in breadth, and 80 to 175 feet above the level of the surrounding country. The circumference of the walls is about 2400 yards. The present fortifications were for the most part constructed by the Musalm\u00e1ns, apparently from materials obtained by pulling down still older Hindu buildings. Sculptured stones, with figures of Hindu deities and heroes in high relief, are found built into the walls and pavements, with their carved faces scornfully turned downwards into the earth. Ornaments bearing the trace of Buddhist workmanship, such as bells and flowers, and even fragmentary jatakas, the sacred Birth-stories, occur. Many of the stones bear the imprint of masons' marks\u2014tridents, swords, fishes, and characters derived from the Nagari and P\u00e1li alphabets. While the magazine and main portions of the fortress stand on a conspicuous height, defended by natural precipices, the lower part lies scarcely above the inundation level of the Ganges, and was flooded in 1875.\n\nTradition assigns a high antiquity to the fort of Chan\u00e1r. Bharti N\u00e1th, king of Ujain, and brother of the half-historic Vikram\u00e1ditya, is said to have chosen this solitary wooded rock overhanging the Ganges as the site of his hermitage. The great Prithwi R\u00e1j\u00e1 is also said to have dwelt in the fortress; and a mutilated slab over the gateway long commemorated its ransom from the Muhammadan invaders. The present buildings are, as above mentioned, the work of later Musalm\u00e1n conquerors, who adapted the ancient Hindu fortifications to their more\nmodern military requirements. The fort passed through many changes of masters, under the Pathan and Mughal dynasties; it was held for Akbar, by a general whose descendants still linger in obscurity around its base; and it finally fell into the hands of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Balwant Singh of Benares about the year 1750 (see Mirzapur District). The British troops, under Major Munro, attacked it without success in 1763; but it came into our possession after the battle of Buxar, in the following year. After R\u00e1j\u00e1 Chait Singh\u2019s outbreak in 1781, Warren Hastings retired to Chan\u00e1r, where a force was collected under Major Popham, which expelled Chait Singh from his strongholds in the neighbourhood, and finally drove him into the Gwalior territory. Hastings was fond of the situation and climate of Chan\u00e1r; his house is still pointed out on the summit, and remains the principal edifice to this day.\n\nThe fort is now used as a place of confinement for State prisoners, and is held by a small garrison. The ordnance enclosure and the magazine are at the north-west end of the plateau overlooking the river. The fort is armed with 18 guns, of various calibre up to 32-pounders, four 8-inch mortars, and 1200 barrels of gunpowder. The garrison would have to be strengthened to over 500 men if the place were to be defended against an attacking force, as several positions would have to be held outside. Warren Hastings\u2019 house is now used as barracks for a company of British infantry; and his staff-quarters adjoining to it form (1883) the residence of three K\u00faka prisoners. A little to the east lies the tomb of a Muhammadan saint, whose piety was clearly established, when he was carried prisoner to Delhi, by his fetters dropping off each evening at time of prayer. The last act of the dying man was to shoot an arrow from the fort into the jungle, to fix the site of his tomb. His mausoleum lies at a rather long bow-shot from the fortress; other Muhammadan mausoleums have grown up around it, and a cemetery in a beautiful garden. It is visited each year by crowds of devotees, both Hindus and Musalm\u00e1ns, but especially the former, who present offerings of rice, and tie a knot on a long string which hangs down in the sanctuary, breathing at the same time a wish or a vow. The town of Chan\u00e1r is the seat of a flourishing native literary society, and has a reading-room, telegraph office, and dispensary.\n\nCh\u00e1nchr\u00e1.\u2014Village in Jessor District, Bengal; about a mile south of Jessore town, and the residence of the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Ch\u00e1nchr\u00e1 or Jessore. Lat. 23\u00b0 9' 0\" N., long. 89\u00b0 14' 45\" E. The Ch\u00e1nchr\u00e1 family traces its origin to one Bhabeswar R\u00e1i, a soldier in Kh\u00e1n-i-Azam\u2019s army, who received a grant of 4 parg\u00e1ns out of the territories conquered from Prat\u00e1paditya (vide Jessore District). He died in 1588 A.D., and his successors added considerably to the original domain. His grandson, Manohar R\u00e1i (1649-1705), is looked upon as the principal founder of the family; and at his death, the estate was by far\nthe largest in the neighbourhood. His second successor divided the family property into two parts, retaining a three-fourths share, known as the Yusafpur estate, for himself, and making over the one-fourth, known as the Sayyidpur estate, to a brother, who some years afterwards died without heirs. At the time of the Permanent Settlement (1793), the Yusafpur estate was in the hands of Sr\u00edk\u00e1nt R\u00e1i, who fell into arrears of land revenue. His property was sold, pargan\u00e1 after pargan\u00e1, and finally he became a pensioner on the bounty of Government. His son, B\u00e1nikant R\u00e1i, succeeded by a suit in regaining a portion of the ancestral estates, gave up his pension, and became again a landholder. On his death a long minority occurred, during which the estate was under the management of the Court of Wards, and greatly increased in value. The last possessor, Barad\u00e1k\u00e1nt R\u00e1i, received a grant in 1823 of one of the pargan\u00e1s confiscated in the time of his predecessors. The title of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Bah\u00e1dur and a khillat of honour was also bestowed on him, in recognition of his position, and for services rendered during the Mutiny. His son, Gyand\u00e1k\u00e1nt R\u00e1i, succeeded him, and is the present (1883) holder of the estate.\n\nCh\u00e1nd\u00e1.\u2014District in the N\u00e1gpur Division of the Chief-Commissionership of the Central Provinces, lying between 19\u00b0 31' and 20\u00b0 53' N. lat., and between 78\u00b0 52' and 80\u00b0 59' E. long. It forms an irregular triangle, with its northern base resting on the Districts of Wardh\u00e1, N\u00e1gpur, and Bhand\u00e1r\u00e1; its western side bounded by the Wardh\u00e1 river, and its south-eastern by the Bast\u00e1r State and R\u00e1ipur District. Population in 1881, 649,146; area, 10,785 square miles. The administrative head-quarters of the District are at Chanda, which is also the principal town.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014Except in the low-lying region in the extreme west, along the Wardh\u00e1 river, Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 is thickly dotted with hills, sometimes rising isolated from the plain, sometimes in short spurs or ridges, all running towards the south. East of the Waingang\u00e1 river, the hills increase in height, and form a broad table-land, at its highest point about 2000 feet above the sea. The Wainganga flows through the centre of the District from north to south, till it meets the Wardh\u00e1 at Seoni, where their united streams form the Pranhita. The eastern regions of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 are drained by the headwaters of the Mah\u00e1n\u00e1di, which flows in a north-easterly direction, and by the Indr\u00e1vati. Each of these rivers receives the waters of many large streams, which in their turn are fed by countless rivulets from the hills. In many places the streams have been formed into lakes, by throwing up dams across the sloping lands which they intersect. Such artificial lakes are found in greatest number in the Garhbor\u00ed and Brahmapuri pargan\u00e1s; as many as 37 can be seen at once from the heights of Perzagarh. To the abundance of its waters Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 owes the luxuriance of\nits forests, which everywhere fringe the cultivated lands. Dense forests clothe the country, girdling or intersecting the cultivated lands, and feathering the highest hills. Along the eastern frontier the trees attain their finest growth, specially in Ah\u00edri, where teak of large size abound. The total area of Government forest was returned in 1881 at 391 square miles of \u2018first-class,\u2019 and 2977 square miles of \u2018second-class\u2019 reserves. The unreserved forests cover an area of 114 square miles. Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 is also rich in wild fibres, lac, tasar, cocoons, beeswax, mahu\u00e1, and other forest produce. The important coal-field at Waror\u00e1, opened out some few years ago, is now connected with the general railway system of India by a State line of railway running from the Wardh\u00e1 station of the Great Indian Peninsula branch line to N\u00e1gpur. Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 is particularly rich in iron-ores, and a scientific inquiry into its resources in this respect was conducted in 1881\u201382, which promises most favourably for the future. The ore varies in appearance from a bright steely substance to a dull red-brown rock, and from a ferruginous earth to a black sand. Gold dust is found in the sands of some of the hill streams; and diamonds and rubies were formerly obtained near Wair\u00e1garh, but the mines have long since been abandoned. The ochres and plastic clays of the District are excellent, and in the vicinity of the Wardh\u00e1 is a valuable layer of silicious sand, as fine-grained as flour. To the lover of scenery and the sportsman, Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 offers singular attractions. The combinations of stream and lake, hill and forest, form a variety of scenes of picturesque beauty; while game of every description swarms in the woods and on the waters.\n\nHistory.\u2014For several centuries before the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 dominion, Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 enjoyed substantial independence from foreign rule, notwithstanding the nominal allegiance of its Gond princes to the Delhi throne. Under the Gond dynasty, the inhabitants of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 were elevated from a savage tribe into an orderly and contented people; large tracts of country were reclaimed from the forest, and engineering works of no mean skill were planned and successfully executed. At what date these princes adopted the Hindu faith cannot be determined; but it was not until the reign of Bir Sh\u00e1h, in the middle of the 17th century, that the yearly sacrifice of cows to Pharsa Pen, the great Gond deity, was entirely abolished. With N\u00edlk\u00e1nt Sh\u00e1h, the Gond line came to an end. That cruel and tyrannical prince made himself hateful to all classes of his subjects; and when, in 1749, the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s under Raghuji Bhonsla blockaded Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1, the city was surrendered without a battle by the treachery of the courtiers. At first Raghuji contented himself with a tribute of two-thirds of the revenues of the kingdom; but two years later he took entire possession of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1, and N\u00edlk\u00e1nt Sh\u00e1h ended his days in confinement. From this time,\nCh\u00e1nd\u00e1 became a province of the Bhonsla family. The loss of its independence marks the close of its prosperity. Contested successions among the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 rulers afforded an opportunity for an unsuccessful Gond rising in 1773 under the son of N\u00edlk\u00e1nt Sh\u00e1h, who, after being defeated and imprisoned, was in 1788 pensioned off by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s on \u00a360 a year. The Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 succession was then adjusted by one claimant slaying the other with his own hand.\n\nCh\u00e1nd\u00e1 next suffered from the Pind\u00e1r\u00eds. About 1800, these organized banditti spread over the District, till few villages had escaped pillage, and hundreds were left wholly desolate. The Pind\u00e1r\u00eds incited to action the predatory castes throughout the country, and between 1802 and 1822, one-half the population is said to have been killed off. Even in the walled city of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1, the number of houses diminished in nearly this proportion. The death of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 R\u00e1j\u00e1 in 1816 left the succession to his only son, Parsoj\u00ed. Blind, lame, and paralyzed, and with an intellect as feeble as his body, this unhappy prince, after being used as a tool in the hands of contending court factions, was found dead in his bed\u2014strangled, as was afterwards discovered, by the secret orders of his cousin, Ap\u00e1 S\u00e1hib, who, as next of kin, now became R\u00e1j\u00e1 of N\u00e1gpur. After various acts of treachery and hostility, Ap\u00e1 S\u00e1hib surrendered to the British, and was reinstated by them, but faithlessly allied himself with the Peshw\u00e1 against them. In 1818, he was seized by the Resident at N\u00e1gpur, on the eve of his throwing himself into Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1. His ally, the Peshw\u00e1 B\u00e1j\u00ed R\u00e1o, pushed on to meet him within 10 miles of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1, when his progress was also checked by a British force; and on the 17th April 1818, he was routed at Pandarkankr\u00e1, west of the Wardh\u00e1 river. The English army then laid siege to Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1, and on the 2nd May carried it by storm in spite of the desperate resistance of the garrison. The kildd\u00e1r (commandant) himself fell fighting gallantly at the head of his soldiers; and the conquerors, admiring his courage, spared his house amid the sack of the town.\n\nThe faithless Ap\u00e1 S\u00e1hib was deposed by the British Government; and the administration of the country was conducted by the Resident, acting in the name and during the minority of the new R\u00e1j\u00e1, Raghuji, with British officers in charge of each District. Under their administration, the disaffected Gonds returned to habits of order, plundering was checked, assessments were reduced, irrigation works were restored, and education was encouraged. But when, in 1839, the government was made over to the R\u00e1j\u00e1, his narrow and grinding policy checked the progress which had begun, and plundering again prevailed through the country. In 1853, Raghuji III. died without an heir; and Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1, with the rest of the N\u00e1gpur Province, was incorporated into the British Empire, the administration being conducted by a\nCommission under the Supreme Government. During the Mutiny, the wild nature of the country, the innate predatory habits of the Gonds, and the proximity of the Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d territory, caused great anxiety; but it was not till March 1858 that order was disturbed. B\u00e1bu R\u00e1o, a petty chief of Monampall\u00ed in the Ah\u00edr\u00ed zam\u00ednd\u00e1ri, then began to plunder the R\u00e1jgarh pargan\u00e1. He was soon joined by Vyankat R\u00e1o, zam\u00ednd\u00e1r of Arpall\u00ed and Ghot; and the two leaders, collecting a band of Rohill\u00e1s and Gonds, openly declared rebellion. On the night of the 29th April, Messrs. Gartland, Hall, and Peter, telegraph employ\u00e9s, were attacked by a party of the rebels near Chunchgundi, on the Pr\u00e1nhit\u00e1 river. Messrs. Gartland and Hall were killed, but Mr. Peter contrived to escape, and joined Captain Crichton, then Deputy Commissioner. Afterwards, disguised as a native, Mr. Peter succeeded in delivering to a leading lady zam\u00ednd\u00e1r, Lakshm\u00ed B\u00e1\u00ed, a letter from Captain Crichton; and by her exertions B\u00e1bu R\u00e1o was captured. He suffered death at Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1, on the 21st October 1858. Vyankat R\u00e1o escaped to Bast\u00e1r; but in April 1860 he was arrested by the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of that State, and handed over to the British authorities, by whom he was sentenced to transportation for life, with forfeiture of all his property.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The population of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 District (after allowing for an increase of 1085 square miles by the incorporation of four t\u00e1luks of the abolished Upper God\u00e1var\u00ed District in 1878\u201379) was returned, according to the Census of 1872, at 558,856. In 1881 the population numbered 649,146, showing an increase of 90,290, or 16\u00b716 per cent., in the nine years. This rapid increase, above the natural excess of births over deaths, is attributed partly to a considerable immigration from the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s territories into the Sironcha Sub-division, and partly to the greater accuracy of the Census of 1881. The details of the enumeration are as follows:\u2014Total population, 649,146, namely, males 326,824, and females 322,322, spread over an area of 10,785 square miles, and living in 2804 villages and towns; number of houses, 170,549, of which 148,135 are occupied and 22,414 unoccupied; average density of population, 60\u00b72 per square mile; number of villages, \u00b726 per square mile; number of houses, 13\u00b774 per square mile; persons per village, 232; persons per occupied house, 4\u00b738. Classified according to religion, the population consisted of\u2014Hindus, 499,327; Kab\u00edrpanth\u00eds, 1064; Satn\u00e1m\u00eds, 173; Muhammadans, 10,987; Sikhs, 5; Christians, 289; Jains, 737; and aboriginal tribes still professing their primitive forms of faith, 136,564. The ethnical division returns the undoubted Hindu castes at 474,769; indefinite castes at 3685; and the non-Hindu or aboriginal tribes at 158,679, of whom 154,701 were Dravidian Gonds, 1466 other Dravidians, and 2513 Kolarian tribes or unspecified.\nAmong Hindus proper, Br\u00e1hmans numbered 6458, and R\u00e1jputs 2221; the inferior Hindu castes above 5000 in number being\u2014Kurm\u00eds, the principal agricultural caste, and the most numerous in the District, 92,806; M\u00e1hars, weavers, day-labourers, and village watchmen, 72,472; Gauri, herdsmen, carters, etc., corresponding to the Go\u00e1la caste in Bengal, 42,796; M\u00e1ra, cultivators, 32,001; Tel\u00ed, oil-pressers, 31,126; M\u00e1ra, cultivators, 28,806; Dhim\u00e1rs, fishermen, dealers in jungle products, etc., 27,875; Kosht\u00ed, weavers, 13,246; Kal\u00e1r, spirit-sellers, 10,689; N\u00e1i, barbers, 5466. As regards the occupations of the people, the Census Report classifies the male population into the following six main divisions:\u2014(1) Professional class, including Government officials and learned professions, 6937; (2) domestic servants, etc., 2291; (3) commercial class, including merchants, traders, carriers, etc., 3988; (4) agricultural and pastoral class, including gardeners, 146,472; (5) manufacturing, artisan, mining, and other industrial classes, 53,893; (6) indefinite and non-productive (comprising 3004 general labourers, and 110,239 unspecified, including children), 113,243.\n\nThere are only three towns in Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 District with a population exceeding 5000\u2014viz., Chanda, the District capital, population (1881) 16,137; Warora, 8022; and Armori, 5584. Towns with 1000 to 5000 inhabitants, 74; villages with from 200 to 1000 inhabitants, 795; with fewer than 200 inhabitants, 1932. The only municipalities are Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 and Warora, with a total population of 24,159, and an income in 1880\u201381 of \u00a32282.\n\nAntiquities and Places of Interest.\u2014The chief architectural objects of interest are the cave temples of Bh\u00e1ndak, Winjbas\u00e1n\u00ed, Dew\u00e1l\u00e1, and Ghug\u00fas; the rock temple in the bed of the Wardh\u00e1, near Ball\u00e1lpur; the ancient temples at M\u00e1rkand\u00ed, N\u00e9ri, Bat\u00e1l\u00e1, Bh\u00e1ndak, Wair\u00e1g\u00e1rh, Ambgi\u00f3n, W\u00e1ghnahk, and Keslabor\u00ed; the monoliths near Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1; the forts of Wair\u00e1g\u00e1rh and Ball\u00e1lpur; and the walls of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 town, its system of waterworks, and the tombs of the Gond kings. The following places are also worthy of visit:\u2014the rapids of the Wardh\u00e1 at Soit, the junction of the Wardh\u00e1 and the Waingang\u00e1 at Seori, the R\u00e1mdighi pool near Kesl\u00e1bor\u00ed, the Mugd\u00e1i spring and caves in the Perz\u00e1g\u00e1rh hills near Dom\u00e1, and the different iron mines, coal seams, and stone and clay quarries.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Of the total area of 10,785 square miles, only 1148 were cultivated in 1881; and of the portion lying waste 5840 were returned as cultivable, and 3797 as uncultivable. Less than a fourth of the cultivated land is irrigated\u2014entirely by private enterprise. The principal crops consist of rice and sugar-cane; excellent cotton, jo\u00e1r, oil-seeds, wheat, gram, and pulses are also grown, and the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 p\u00e1n gardens are famous throughout the Province. The area under the\nprincipal crops was returned as follows in 1881-82:\u2014Rice, 245,406 acres; wheat, 83,091; other food-grains, 281,698; oil-seeds, 121,323; sugar-cane, 5364; cotton, 25,139; fibres, 1345; tobacco, 2962; and vegetables, 9644 acres. These figures include land bearing two crops in the year. Horned cattle, of indifferent quality, are bred in great numbers. Large flocks of sheep abound, principally kept for their wool and manure. The God\u00e1var\u00ed breed, found in the extreme south, have coats of hair rather than wool. Goats and poultry, both good of their kind, are plentiful. The agricultural stock of the District approximately comprises 459,379 cows, bullocks, and buffaloes, 583 horses, 546 ponies, 386 asses, 113,469 sheep and goats, 4217 pigs, 36,236 carts, and 46,898 ploughs.\n\nThe Census of 1881 showed a total of 3780 landed proprietors; tenants of all ranks numbered 112,784, of whom 18,410 had either absolute or occupancy rights, while 24,605 were tenants-at-will, and 69,799 engaged in home cultivation. The average area cultivated in 1881 by each head of the regular agricultural population (253,238, or 39.01 per cent. of the District population) was 15 acres; the amount of Government land revenue and local cesses, levied from the landholders, was \u00a329,071; and the amount of rental, including cesses, paid by the cultivators was \u00a349,297, or an average of 1s. 3\u00bdd. per cultivated acre. Average rent per acre, in 1881, of land suited for rice, 1s. 4\u00bdd.; for sugar-cane, 3s. 4d.; for wheat, 1s.; for cotton, 10\u00bdd.; for oil-seeds or inferior grain, 1s.; for fibres, 11d.; for tobacco, 7d. Average produce of land per acre, in lbs.\u2014rice, 498; g\u00far or unrefined sugar, 666; wheat, 390; inferior grain, 236; cotton, 64; oil-seeds, 304; tobacco, 320. Average price of produce per cwt.\u2014rice, 4s. 5d.; g\u00far, 16s. 4d.; wheat, 4s. 9d.; gram, 4s. 1d.; cotton, \u00a33, 13s. 9d.; linseed, 6s. 10d.; jo\u00e1r, 4s. Average wages per diem\u2014skilled labour, 1s.; unskilled, 3\u00bdd.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014In September 1797, the Vir\u00e1\u00ed river rose to an extraordinary height, flooding the entire city of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1, and submerging numerous dwellings.\n\nCommerce and Trade.\u2014The external commerce of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 is principally with Wardh\u00e1, N\u00e1gpur, Bhand\u00e1r\u00e1, and Raipur Districts, with Bast\u00e1r State, and the eastern coast Districts, and with the Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d territories and Ber\u00e1r. The trade is mainly carried on by means of annual fairs, the most important of which are held at Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 in April, and at Bh\u00e1ndak in February, being frequented by visitors from distant parts of India. Trade, which had dwindled away almost to nothing subsequent to the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 conquest, has revived wonderfully under British rule; and Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 now promises to become a great commercial centre, as a few years will in all probability see the town connected with Bombay on the west by the extension of the Wardh\u00e1 railway from Waror\u00e1 to Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1, and also with Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d.\non the south, the capital of the Deccan. The chief manufacture consists of the weaving of fine and coarse cotton cloths, which once found their way as far as Arabia, and are still largely exported to Western India. Silk fabrics are well made, although the demand for them is not great; and there are also stuffs manufactured of a mixture of silk and cotton. Large numbers of tasar silkworms are bred in the forests, and the wound silk thence obtained forms an important item of export. Considerable quantities of excellent iron are smelted, both for home and foreign use; and from the resources of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 in coal, cotton, and iron, and the abundance of labour, the rise of great manufacturing industries may be confidently anticipated as soon as further means of transit are opened up. The important colliery of Waror\u00e1 was producing, in 1877, coal at the rate of 3500 tons per month, and giving employment to 350 men; but this output had declined to a total of 10,107 tons for the year 1881-82. The coal sells, when screened, for 10s. a ton, and has proved sufficiently good for locomotive fuel on the railways. The iron resources of the District were scientifically inquired into in 1881-82 by a gentleman of great experience in iron-mining in Austria, and his opinion of the prospects for iron in Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 is most favourable. With the construction of an ironwork at Dung\u00e1pur, and the erection of more blast furnaces, there seemed to him no reason to doubt of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 turning out 260,000 tons of iron or steel yearly. He reported further that, besides supplying India with much of her steel and iron requirements, Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 is able to open an export trade to England in certain articles now imported into England from the Continent, particularly in Ferromanganese and Brescian steel.\n\nCommunications in 1881:\u2014By the Waingang\u00e1 and Wardh\u00e1 rivers, at certain seasons, 252 miles; made roads, second-class, 42 miles; railroads, 17 miles, being the coal-branch line from Waror\u00e1 to Wardh\u00e1, where it joins the Great Indian Peninsula Railway system.\n\nThere is a first-class dispensary in the city of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1, with branch dispensaries at Armori, Brahmapuri, and Waror\u00e1.\n\nAdministration.\u2014In 1861, Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 was formed into a separate British District. It is administered by a Deputy Commissioner, with Assistants and tahsild\u00e1rs. Total revenue in 1876-77, imperial and local, \u00a344,395, of which the land revenue yielded \u00a324,529. Total cost of District officials and police of all kinds, \u00a313,786. By 1881-82, the total revenue had increased to \u00a387,778, or nearly doubled itself, while the land revenue had increased only to \u00a327,847; the expenditure on officials and police amounted to \u00a315,292. Number of civil and revenue judges in 1881, 10; of magistrates, 12. Maximum distance of any village from the nearest court, 130 miles; average distance, 20 miles. Number of police, 615, costing \u00a38623; being 1 policeman to about every 17\u00b754 square miles and every 1055 persons. The daily average\nnumber of convicts in jail in 1881 was 97, of whom 9 were females. The number of Government or aided schools in the District under Government inspection was 64, attended by 3735 pupils.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The rainy season sets in about the middle of June, and lasts till the end of September. Showers, on which the dry crops and sugar-cane are dependent, are also expected in November and December. Average annual rainfall, 50\u00b77 inches; rainfall in 1881, 56\u00b78 inches, or 5\u00b79 inches above the average. Temperature in the shade at the civil station during the year 1881\u2014May, highest reading 115\u00b0 F., lowest reading 67\u00b71\u00b0; July, highest reading 93\u00b0, lowest 72\u00b0; December, highest 85\u00b0, lowest 44\u00b0.\n\nFrom the middle of September to the end of November, malarious fever prevails throughout the District, exposure to the night air being especially dangerous. Cholera frequently occurs, and dysentery, diarrhoea, and small-pox carry off large numbers; but it may be hoped that the increased attention paid to vaccination will mitigate the last-mentioned scourge. [For additional information regarding Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1, see the Settlement Report of the District by Major C. B. Lucie Smith (1869). Also The Central Provinces Gazetteer, by Charles Grant, Esq., C.S. (second edition, N\u00e1gpur, 1870); the Central Provinces Census Report for 1881; and the Annual Administration Reports for the Central Provinces from 1880 to 1883.]\n\nCh\u00e1nd\u00e1.\u2014Chief town and administrative head-quarters of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 District, Central Provinces. Lat. 19\u00b0 56' 30\" N., long. 79\u00b0 20' 30\" E.; population (1881) 16,137, chiefly Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s and Telingas, the latter including most of the tradesmen and artisans. Hindus numbered 14,340; Kab\u00edrpanthis, 4; Sikh, 1; Muhammadans, 1308; Christians, 79; Jains, 112; and aboriginal tribes, 293. Principal agricultural products\u2014p\u00e1n leaves, sugar-cane, and vegetables; manufactures of fine and coarse cotton cloths, silk fabrics, brass utensils, leather slippers, and bamboo work. Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 carries on a considerable trade, especially at the great fair, which begins in April and lasts three weeks. The town is surrounded by a continuous wall of cut stone, 5\u00bd miles in circuit, crowned with battlements, and having a crenelated parapet and broad rampart. There are 4 gates and 5 wickets. Inside the walls are detached villages and cultivated fields, and without lie the suburbs. Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 stands amid charming scenery. Dense forest stretches to the north and east; on the south rise the blue ranges of M\u00e1nikdr\u00fag; while westward opens a cultivated rolling country, with distant hills. Set in this picture, sweep the long lines of the ramparts now seen, now lost, among great groves of ancient trees. In front glitters the broad expanse of the Ram\u00e1la tank; while the Jharpat and Vira\u00ed flow on either side. The citadel, now enclosing the jail, contains a large well with an underground passage, leading no\none knows whither. The tombs of the Gond kings, the Achaleswar, Mah\u00e1 K\u00e1l\u00ed, and Murl\u00eddhar temples, with the massive monoliths at L\u00e1lpet, form the most striking monuments in the place. The public buildings consist of\u2014the kotwili with garden in front, the sild schoolhouse, the dispensary, the travellers' bungalow, and the sar\u00e1i. Near the Jatpur\u00e1 gate is the Victoria market; and a public park extends between the city and the civil station, which lies to the north of the city, with the military cantonment at the west end, and the civil lines in the centre and east. This park contains the District court-house, the head-quarters police station-house, a Christian cemetery, quarters for a regiment of Native infantry, and post-office. Municipal revenue (1880-81) \u00a31283, of which \u00a31001 was derived from taxation, or an average of 1s. 3d. per head of population.\n\nCh\u00e1nd\u00e1.\u2014Pargan\u00e1 of Sult\u00e1npur District, Oudh, lying between pargan\u00e1 Patti of Part\u00e1bgarh District on the south, and pargan\u00e1 Alde-mau on the north. Area, 130 square miles, of which 73 are cultivated; Government land revenue, \u00a39773. The villages, which number 290, are nearly all in the possession of Bachgoti R\u00e1jputs; the R\u00e1jkum\u00e1rs, one branch of that clan, owning 114; and the R\u00e1jw\u00e1rs, another branch, 138. About half the pargan\u00e1, or 146 villages, is held in t\u00e1lukd\u00e1r\u00ed, and 144 villages in zamind\u00e1r\u00ed tenure. Population (1881), Hindus, 71,408; Muhammadans, 5382; total, 76,790, viz. 39,069 males and 37,721 females. Among high castes, the most numerous are Br\u00e1hmans (14,091), and R\u00e1jputs (7662); among low castes, Cham\u00e1rs (14,883), and Ah\u00edrs (6325). The road from Jaunpur to Lucknow runs through the pargan\u00e1.\n\nCh\u00e1nd\u00e1la.\u2014Small zamind\u00e1r\u00ed or estate in the M\u00fal tahsil of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 District, Central Provinces. Area, 17 square miles, containing 7 villages, with 117 occupied houses, and a population (1881) of 675. The zamind\u00e1r\u00ed is of recent creation, having been granted to the first holder about 1820.\n\nChandan.\u2014River rising in the hills near Deogarh, in Bh\u00e1galpur District, Bengal. It flows a northerly course, and is fed by numerous tributaries. As it approaches the Ganges, it throws off branches to the east and west; and at its point of junction with the great river, near Bh\u00e1galpur town, its main channel is reduced to insignificant dimensions. Greatest width, 1500 feet from bank to bank. Except in the rains, its channel is a mere bed of coarse sand; but it is liable to sudden and violent inundations, which do great damage to the surrounding country. Embankments are constructed on both sides.\n\nChandarnagar (popularly Chundernagore, correctly Chandan-nagar\u2014'City of Sandalwood').\u2014French settlement, within the boundaries of H\u00fagl\u00ed District, Bengal; situated on the right bank of the H\u00fagl\u00ed river, a short distance below Chinsurah. Lat. 22\u00b0 51' 40\" N., long. 88\u00b0 24' 50\" E.\nChandarnagar, occupied by the French in 1673, was acquired in 1688, and rose to importance in the time of Dupleix, during whose administration (1731-41) more than 2000 brick houses were erected, and a considerable maritime trade was developed. In 1757 it was bombarded by Admiral Watson, and captured; the fortifications and houses were afterwards demolished. On peace being established, the town was restored to the French in 1763. When hostilities broke out in 1794, it was again seized by the English; restored by treaty, 1802; retaken the same year; and held by them till the Peace of 1815 definitively made it over to the French, 4th December 1816. All the former grandeur of Chandarnagar has now passed away, and at present it is a quiet suburban town, with but little external trade. It continues, however, the official seat of a French sub-governor, with a few soldiers. The railway station, on the East Indian Railway, is just outside French territory, 22 miles from Calcutta (Howrah). Chandarnagar receives from the English Government 300 chests of opium annually, on condition that the inhabitants do not engage in the manufacture of that article. The sub-governor is subordinate to the French Governor-General at Pondicherry.\n\n**Chandauli.**\u2014South-eastern tahsil of Benares District, North-Western Provinces, including the whole portion of the District on the right bank of the Ganges. Traversed by the East Indian Railway, with a branch from Mughal Sarai to the bank opposite Benares. Area, 418 square miles, of which 335 are cultivated; population (1881) 240,698; land revenue, \u00a328,634; total Government revenue, \u00a331,597; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a366,617. The tahsil contained in 1883, 3 criminal courts, with 6 police stations (th\u00e1n\u00eds); strength of regular police, 81 men; village watchmen (chaukid\u00e1rs), 507.\n\n**Chandaus\u00ed.**\u2014Town in Morad\u00e1b\u00e1d District, North-Western Provinces, 27 miles from Morad\u00e1b\u00e1d town. Lat. 28\u00b0 27' 5\" N., long. 78\u00b0 49' 20\" E.; population (1882) 27,521, namely, 20,381 Hindus, 6990 Muhammadans, 29 Jains, 118 Christians, and 3 'others;' area, 220 acres. Municipal income in 1881-82, \u00a31238, derived principally from octroi. Lies on the Bud\u00e1un road, 28 miles south of Morad\u00e1b\u00e1d, and 4 miles west of the Sot river. Station on Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway, with junction for Aligarh branch. Principal mart for surrounding parts of Rohilkhand; considerable export trade in sugar. Large cotton-pressing factory, under European management. Dispensary, and telegraph office. Extensive quarries of kankar or nodular limestone.\n\n**Chandavolu** (*Tsandavolu*).\u2014Town in Kistna District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 16\u00b0 1' N., long. 80\u00b0 40' E.; houses, 560; population (1881) 2895, namely, 1992 Hindus, 896 Muhammadans, and 7 Christians. A large treasure of gold bricks was found here in 1873.\nCh\u00e1ndb\u00e1li.\u2014River port on the left bank of the Baitarani river, Balasor District, Orissa. Lat. 20\u00b0 46' 30\" N., long. 86\u00b0 47' 56\" E. This place has risen to importance only within the last few years, and is now the centre of a rapidly growing trade. Several steamers ply regularly between Calcutta and Ch\u00e1ndb\u00e1li, and an idea has been entertained of making the latter a sea-bathing place for the metropolis. Value of imports, 1873-74, \u00a3112,143, exports \u00a361,436; 1881-82, imports \u00a3435,672, exports \u00a3339,170. The trade in merchandise is supplemented by a passenger traffic, which in 1874-75 amounted to 32,000 persons either way. A portion of these passengers are pilgrims on their way to and from the shrine of Jagann\u00e1th\u2014chiefly up-country people of the middle class, who can afford to pay their fare by rail to Calcutta, and by steamer to Orissa. There is also a strictly local passenger traffic of Uriy\u00e1s, who resort to Calcutta in considerable numbers in search of domestic service.\n\nChanderi.\u2014District in Gwalior State, Central India. Contains 380 villages, transferred in full sovereignty to the British Government by the treaty of 1860, among other Districts, for the maintenance of the Gwalior Contingent. Chief town, Chanderi.\n\nChanderi.\u2014Town in Sindhi\u00e1's territory, Gwalior, Central India, and head-quarters of Chanderi District; at present an insignificant place, but once a fortified town of importance and splendour. Lat. 24\u00b0 42' 0\" N., long. 78\u00b0 11' 0\" E. Distant 105 miles south of Gwalior, 170 south of Agra, and 280 south of Delhi. According to the Ain-i-Akbar\u00ed, it contained '14,000 stone houses, 384 markets, 360 caravanserais, and 12,000 mosques.' The fort, surrounded by a sandstone rampart, and guarded by circular towers, is situated on a high hill. It was a place of great strength, and at one time sustained a siege of eight months. The ruins which remain show that some of the buildings of the ancient city must have been of considerable size and magnificence. Among other memorials of the former greatness of Ch\u00e1nderi, a pass cut through a solid rock, 100 feet high, is conspicuous. The rock bears an inscription, stating that the lofty gate of G\u00famti and Karauli, near the tank, was built in 1301 by Ghi\u00e1s-ud-d\u00edn, Emperor of Delhi.\n\nChandg\u00e1on.\u2014Town in the head-quarters Sub-division of Chittagong District. Population (1881) 5276, namely, 2602 males and 2674 females.\n\nCh\u00e1nd\u00edsth\u00e1n.\u2014Shrine in Basdeopur village, Monghyr District, Bengal; sacred to Ch\u00e1ndi, the tutelary goddess of the place. The shrine is covered by a small brick building.\n\nCh\u00e1ndkh\u00e1l\u00ed.\u2014Village in Khuln\u00e1 District, Bengal; situated on the Kabadak, about 10 miles north of the point where that river enters the Sundarban forest. Lat. 22\u00b0 32' 0\" N., long. 89\u00b0 17' 30\" E. Ch\u00e1ndkh\u00e1l\u00ed\nwas one of the villages founded about 1782 by Mr. Henckell, the Magistrate, in pursuance of his scheme for the reclamation of the Sundarbans. It is now a leading mart in this part of the country, to which the villagers bring their rice for sale, purchasing in return their little home stores and necessaries. Monday is the market day, and the picturesque scene is thus graphically described by Mr. J. Westland in his District Report on Jessore:\u2014\u2018If one were to visit Ch\u00e1ndkh\u00e1l\u00ed on an ordinary day, one would see a few sleepy huts on the river bank, and pass it by as some insignificant village. The huts are, many of them, shops, and they are situated round a square; but there are no purchasers to be seen, and the square is deserted. On Sunday, however, large native craft come up from all directions, but chiefly from Calcutta, and anchor along the banks of the river and creek, waiting for the market. On Monday, boats pour in from all directions laden with grain, and others come with purchasers. The river, a large enough one, and the kh\u00e1l\u00ed or creek, become alive with native craft and boats, pushing in among each other, and literally covering the face of the water. Sales are going on rapidly amid all the hubbub; and the traders and merchants are filling their ships with the grain which the husbandmen have brought alongside and sold to them. The greater part of the traffic takes place on the water; but on land, too, it is a busy sight. On water or on land, there is probably a representative from nearly every house for miles around. They have come to sell their grain and to buy their stores; numberless hawkers have come to offer these stores for sale\u2014oil, turmeric, tobacco, vegetables, and all the other luxuries of a peasant\u2019s life. By evening, the business is done; the husbandmen turn their boats homewards; the hawkers go off to the next market village, or procure fresh supplies; and with the first favourable tide the ships weigh anchor, and take their cargoes away to Calcutta. By Tuesday morning the place is deserted.\u2019 Ch\u00e1ndkh\u00e1l\u00ed is also the principal seat of the Sundarbans wood trade. Police outpost station.\n\nCh\u00e1ndko.\u2014The old name for a fertile tract of alluvial land in Sind, Bombay Presidency, on the right bank of the Indus, lying between 26\u00b0 40\u2019 and 27\u00b0 20\u2019 N. lat., and between 67\u00b0 25\u2019 and 68\u00b0 E. long. It is inhabited by the Ch\u00e1ndia tribe, to the chief of whom a portion was made over in j\u00e1gir by the Talpur dynasty in 1818. In 1842, W\u00e1li Muhammad, the then j\u00e1gird\u00e1r, having shown sympathy with the hostile M\u00edrs, this estate was seized by M\u00edr Ali Mur\u00e1d of Khairpur. Sir C. Napier, however, restored it. In 1859, the original portion was confirmed to the present chief, Ghaibi Kh\u00e1n Ch\u00e1ndra. The chief town of this tract is Ghaibi Dero.\n\nCh\u00e1ndod.\u2014Village and place of Hindu pilgrimage in Gujar\u00e1t (Guzer\u00e1t), within the territory of the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda, Bombay\nPresidency; population (1881) 4200. Situated 30 miles south-east of Baroda, on the right bank of the river Narbad\u00e1 (Nerbudda), in lat. 21\u00b0 58' N., and long. 73\u00b0 29' E., and 12 miles south of Dabhoi, with which town it is connected by a narrow-gauge State Railway, a branch of which terminates there. Close to Ch\u00e1ndod is the village of Karn\u00e1li, and territory of the petty R\u00e1j\u00e1 of M\u00e1ndwa. Both these villages, the temples, and certain sacred spots on the river, are twice a year visited by from 20,000 to 25,000 persons. The chief fairs are held on the full moon of K\u00e1rtik (October \u2013 November) and Chaitra (March and April). Forbes wrote a century ago, what is still the truth: \u2018No place in the Western Province of Hindustan is reputed so holy as Ch\u00e1ndod; none at least exceed it; its temples and seminaries almost vie with the fane of Jagann\u00e1th and the colleges of Benares.\u2019 Should the Narbad\u00e1 take the place of the Ganges in the estimation of the pious, Ch\u00e1ndod would become its Benares. Branch post-office; two dharms\u00e1l\u00e1s.\n\nCh\u00e1ndor (or Ch\u00e1ndwar).\u2014Sub-division occupying the centre of N\u00e1sik District, Bombay Presidency. Area (1881) 385 square miles, containing 2 towns and 106 villages, with 8177 occupied houses. Population, 50,899, namely, males 25,917, and females 24,982. Hindus numbered 44,485; Muhammadans, 2414; and \u2018others,\u2019 4400. Except in the eastern corner, which is roughened by bare hills and which drains east to the Girn\u00e1, Ch\u00e1ndor is a waving plain, sloping gently down to the God\u00e1var\u00ed. In the centre and south the soil is a deep rich black alluvium, yielding heavy crops of wheat and gram. In other parts, the soil is poor and shallow. The Sub-division is well provided with roads. The cultivators are generally in debt, but some villages show signs of material comfort. Of 118,487 acres under cultivation in 1880\u201381, grain crops occupied 96,115 acres, or 81\u00bd per cent.; pulses, 14,350 acres, or 12\u00bd per cent.; oil-seeds, 5652 acres, or 4\u00bd per cent.; and miscellaneous crops, 2257, or 1\u00bd per cent. In 1880\u201381, the number of holdings was returned at 3530, with an average area of a little over 43 acres, paying an average rental to Government of \u00a33, 5s. 7\u00bdd. Divided among the agricultural population, these holdings show an average allotment of 17\u00bd acres per head, each paying an average land-tax of \u00a31, 6s. 6d. In 1883, the Sub-division contained 2 criminal courts and 1 police station (th\u00e1n\u00e1); strength of regular police, 28 men; village watchmen (chaukid\u00e1rs), 130.\n\nCh\u00e1ndor (Ch\u00e1ndwar).\u2014Town in Ch\u00e1ndor Sub-division, N\u00e1sik District, Bombay Presidency; situated in lat. 20\u00b0 19' 40'' N., and long. 74\u00b0 19' 0'' E., at the foot of a range of hills varying from 4000 to 4500 feet in height, 40 miles north-east of N\u00e1sik town. Population (1881) 4892, namely, Hindus, 3551; Muhammadans, 1061; Jains, 73; Christians, 6; \u2018others,\u2019 201. Before the opening of the railway,\nthere was a small manufacture of copper and brass pots and ironwork. A market is held here once a week, and there is a post-office. Ch\u00e1ndor is said to have been founded by Holkar in 1763, and remained until 1818 the private property of that chief. The Mah\u00e1-r\u00e1j\u00e1 has a large, and once magnificent, house (w\u00e1d\u00e1) in the centre of the town. The old fort of Ch\u00e1ndor, 3994 feet high, on the flat summit of a hill rising immediately above the town, is nearly inaccessible, and commands an important gh\u00fat or passage on the route from Kh\u00e1ndesh to Bombay. Weekly market held on Mondays; two Hindu temples, and a Muhammadan mosque.\n\nCh\u00e1ndpur.\u2014Tahsil of Bijnaur (Bijnor) District, North-Western Provinces, comprising the parg\u00e1n\u00e1s of Ch\u00e1ndpur, Burhpur, and B\u00e1shta. Area, 307 square miles, of which 213 are cultivated; population (1881) 123,679; land revenue, \u00a321,050; total Government revenue, \u00a323,870; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a342,860. The tahsil contained in 1881, 1 civil and 2 criminal courts, with 3 police stations (th\u00e1nd\u00e1s); strength of regular police, including municipal and town police, 103 men; village watchmen (chaukid\u00e1rs) and road police, 299.\n\nCh\u00e1ndpur.\u2014Town in Bijnaur (Bijnor) District, North-Western Provinces, and head-quarters of Ch\u00e1ndpur tahsil, distant from Bijnaur 19 miles south. Lat. 29\u00b0 8' 25\" N., long. 78\u00b0 18' 50\" E.; area, 165 acres; population (1882) 11,182, namely, Muhammadans, 7618; Hindus, 3557; and Christians, 7. Municipal income in 1880-81, \u00a3512. Ch\u00e1ndpur, which in 1868 was officially described by the Sanitary Commissioner as the 'filthiest place in this Province,' is now a well paved and drained town, with a thriving appearance, and containing several fine brick-built houses. Besides the usual tahsili courts and offices, it contains an imperial post-office, first-class police station, dispensary, native inn, boys' and girls' schools, five or six temples or mosques, etc. Seven unmetalled roads connect the town with the surrounding country. A considerable trade in sugar and grain is carried on at markets which are held twice a week. The local manufactures comprise earthenware pipe-bowls (chilam) and jugs (sarahi), and the weaving of cotton cloth.\n\nCh\u00e1ndpur.\u2014Seaside village at the mouth of the H\u00fagl\u00ed, Midnapur District, Bengal; a few miles higher up than Birkul, and 14 miles from Contai, with which it is connected by a fair-weather road. This place and Birkul are favourably situated for watering-places and sanitaria for Calcutta during the hot summer months, and a fine travellers' bungalow has been constructed. Ch\u00e1ndpur lies a short distance inland, well raised above inundation level, and with a fine turf lawn half a mile long by 300 yards broad, on almost any part of which excellent water is to be got by digging. The sea is visible from this raised lawn; and below is a beach of firm, hard sand, stretching for\nmiles on either side. Water carriage is available almost to the very spot; and during the summer months there is a cool sea-breeze, day and night.\n\n**Chandra.** \u2014 River in Kangra District, Punjab, and one of the principal headwaters of the Chen\u00e1b. Rises in L\u00e1h\u00fal, from the side of a huge snow-bed, more than 16,000 feet above the sea, on the southeastern slopes of the B\u00e1r\u00e1 L\u00e1cha Pass. Becomes unfordable a mile below its source. Flows south-eastward for 55 miles, when it sweeps round the base of the Mid-Him\u00e1layas, until it is joined by the Bh\u00e1g\u00e1 river at T\u00e1ndi, after a course of 115 miles, in lat. $32^\\circ 33' \\text{N.}$, and long. $77^\\circ 1' \\text{E.}$ For the first 75 miles, the valley of the Chandra is entirely uninhabited, the bare hills sloping down to its bed and hemming it in with broken cliffs. Their sides, however, yield a scanty pasturage for sheep and goats during the summer months. Near the P\u00e1lamo Pass, the river expands into a lake three-quarters of a mile in length. Permanent habitations first occur near Koksar, at the foot of the Rohtang Pass. From this point the Chandra enters a wider valley, dotted with villages and cultivated fields. On the southern side, however, the mountains overhang its bed in precipitous masses, a cliff above Ghondl\u00e1 rising to a sheer height of 11,000 feet from the water's edge. After its junction with the Bh\u00e1g\u00e1, at T\u00e1ndi, the united stream bears the name of Chen\u00e1b. The fall on the Chandra from its source to T\u00e1ndi averages 65 feet per mile.\n\n**Chandra.** \u2014 *Pargan\u00e1* in Sit\u00e1pur District, Oudh, lying between the G\u00famti river on the west and the Kathna on the east, both rivers meeting at Dudhu\u00e1m\u00e1n in the extreme south; bounded on the north by Kheri District. This *pargan\u00e1* was held successively by the Bais, Ah\u00edrs, Sayyids, and Gaurs; the latter acquiring it about 200 years ago, under a chieftain named Kiri Mall, whose descendants still hold 130 out of the total number of 150 villages. Area, 129 square miles, of which 91\u00bd are cultivated. The average incidence of the Government land revenue is 1s. 11\u00bdd. per acre of cultivated area, 1s. 6\u00bdd. per acre of cultivable area, or 1s. 5d. per acre of total area. The cause of this low rate is the poorness of the soil. Population (1881) 34,874, namely, males 18,986, and females 15,888.\n\n**Chandra Drona.** \u2014 Hill range, Kadur District, Mysore State. \u2014 See Baba Budan.\n\n**Chandragiri** ('Moon-hill'). \u2014 *T\u00e1luk* of North Arcot District, Madras Presidency. Area, 548 square miles, containing 2 towns and 135 villages. Houses, 17,650; population (1881) 93,151, namely, 47,090 males and 46,061 females. The most northerly *t\u00e1luk* of the District, adjoining Cuddapah. The Eastern Gh\u00e1ts run through the north, while the Karvaitnagar hills occupy most of the south of the *t\u00e1luk*. Indeed, the entire tract may be said to consist of hills, more or less\nbare or rocky, and of narrow valleys rich with the alluvial soil brought down from the hills. Its physical characteristics render it one of the most fertile divisions of North Arcot, the water-level being always high and the scrub jungle on the hills affording abundance of leaf manure. The Chandragiri Telugu cultivators are probably the best in the District, hard-working, and fond of high farming. Extensive and valuable forests cover about 300 square miles, but these have only recently been brought under a proper system of conservancy. The land revenue demand in 1882-83 amounted to \u00a38166. In the same year, the taluk contained 2 criminal courts, being subject in civil matters to the jurisdiction of the munsif's court at Tripati. Number of police stations (thindis), 10; strength of police force, 104 men.\n\n**Chandragiri.** \u2014 Town in the Chandragiri taluk, North Arcot District, Madras Presidency; situated on the right bank of the Suvarnamukhi river, 16 miles south of the Tripati railway station, in lat. $13^\\circ 35' 15''$ N., and long. $79^\\circ 21' 30''$ E. Population (1881) 4193, namely, 3811 Hindus and 382 Muhammadans. As the headquarters of the taluk, it contains the usual sub-divisional public offices, jail, post-office, etc. Historically, Chandragiri presents much of interest, having been, after the defeat of Talikot in 1564, the residence of the Rajas of Vijayanagar. The fort, built about 1510, fell in 1646 into the power of the Golconda chief, from whom it was wrested, a century later, by the Nawab of Arcot. In 1758 it was held by Nawab Abdul Wahab Khan, who in virtue of its possession assumed the protection of the sacred town of Tripati. In 1782, Haidar Ali compelled the fort to surrender, and it remained subject to Mysore until the treaty of Seringapatam in 1792. It is built on a huge granite rock rising about 600 feet above the surrounding country, and, both from its site and fortifications, must in former times have been impregnable by storm. Its chief interest lies in the fact that here was signed, in 1640, the original treaty granting to the East India Company the site of Fort St. George or Madras. The modern town of Chandragiri is neatly built, to the east of the hill on which stands the fort. The old town, which in former times must have been very extensive, has almost disappeared, and its site converted into fertile fields. The surrounding country is very productive, and the scenery charming. Interesting archaeological remains are found, consisting of deserted temples, grand tanks, and fine carved mantappams.\n\n**Chandragiri** (or Puiswinni). \u2014 River in South Kanara District, Madras Presidency; rises (lat. $12^\\circ 27'$ N., long. $75^\\circ 40'$ E.) in the Western Ghats near Sampaji, and, after a westerly course of 65 miles, enters the sea 2 miles south of Cassergode, in lat. $12^\\circ 29'$ N., long. $75^\\circ 1' 6''$ E. When in flood, the stream is utilized for floating down the timber cut on the Ghats, but, except for about 15 miles above its\nmouth, it is not at other seasons navigable. A fort, situated on its left bank, commands this portion of the river. The Chandragiri forms the northern boundary between the Malayalam and Tuluvu countries; and the traditions of the people forbid any Nair woman to cross it.\n\n**Chandraguna.** \u2014 Village and head-quarters of a police station (th\u00e1n\u00e1) in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, Bengal; situated on the river Karnaphuli. Administrative head-quarters of the District until 1868, when they were transferred to R\u00e1ng\u00e1mati. Considerable river traffic in timber and hill products, rice, salt, spices, piece-goods, cattle, tobacco, etc. Revenue toll station.\n\n**Chandra-gutti** ('Moon-obscuring').\u2014Projecting peak of the Western Gh\u00e1ts, in Shimoga District, Mysore State; 2836 feet above sea-level. Lat. 14\u00b0 27' 0\" N., long. 74\u00b0 58' 25\" E. Formerly a fortified stronghold of a series of local chieftains. On the summit is a temple dedicated to Renuka, the mother of Parasu R\u00e1m\u00e1. The village at the eastern base has a population (1881) of 809.\n\n**Chandrakona.** \u2014 Mountains in Mysore State.\u2014See Baba Budan.\n\n**Chandrakona.** \u2014 Town and head-quarters of a police circle (th\u00e1n\u00e1) in Midnapur District, Bengal. Lat. 22\u00b0 44' 20\" N., long. 87\u00b0 33' 20\" E. The site of a factory in the time of the East India Company, with a large weaving population, most of whom, upon the withdrawal of the Company from their commercial concerns, were forced to give up their hereditary occupation and take to agriculture. It still contains many weaving families, who produce cotton fabrics of superior quality; and is also a large trading centre. Population (1881) 11,801 Hindus, 456 Muhammadans\u2014total, 12,257, namely, 6059 males and 6198 females; area of town site, 3840 acres; municipal income (1881-82) \u00a3353.\n\n**Chandranagar** (or Chundernagore).\u2014French town and settlement in H\u00fagl\u00ed District, Bengal.\u2014See Chandarnagar.\n\n**Chandran\u00e1th.** \u2014 Village in Chittagong District, Bengal. Lat. 22\u00b0 37' 55\" N., long. 91\u00b0 43' 40\" E. Situated on S\u00edt\u00e1kund Hill, and a frequented place of pilgrimage.\u2014See Sitakund.\n\n**Chandrapur** (with Padmapur).\u2014Estate or zam\u00ednd\u00edr\u00ed in Sambalpur District, Central Provinces. Formed in 1860 from two Government pargan\u00e1s. Certain landholders having joined the Surendra S\u00e1 rebellion in 1858, their estates, worth about \u00a3300 per annum, were confiscated and granted to R\u00e1i R\u00fap Singh, a R\u00e1jput, at that time a Deputy Collector in the District. On the amnesty, these estates were restored at the petition of their former owners; and as the Government revenue from Chandrapur and Padmapur then amounted to \u00a3755, Major Impey, the Deputy Commissioner, recommended that, to compensate R\u00e1i R\u00fap Singh, these pargan\u00e1s should be made over to him for 40 years, subject to a fixed payment of \u00a3413. Both extend along the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed\nriver; Padmapur about 40 miles north-west of Sambalpur, and Chandrapur 20 miles farther westward, with a portion of Raigarh State between them. Chandrapur-cum-Padmapur contained in 1881 an area of 300 square miles, and 248 villages, with 1283 occupied and 361 unoccupied houses; total population, 66,589, namely, males 33,661, and females 33,528; average density of population, 222 per square mile. This estate, lying along the left bank of the Mahanadi, is situated in the north-west corner of the District. Padmapur pargana forms a compact estate, well wooded and watered, with a fertile soil, yielding good crops of rice, cotton, oil-seeds, sugar-cane, and a little arhar. Chandrapur is a straggling detached pargana, well watered throughout, but without any forests, and with a soil in some parts sandy, and in others black clay. The crops raised are rice, sugar-cane, and oil-seeds on the lighter soils; while gram and wheat are grown on the clay. Manufacture of tasar cloth. The income of the jagirdar is \u00a31225. Four schools, with an average attendance of 113 boys, receive a grant-in-aid.\n\nChandur.\u2014Town in Ellichpur District, Berar; 16 miles east of Ellichpur town. Population (1881) 4816. A weekly market is held here, yielding considerable revenue, which is devoted to the improvement of the town and of the market itself. Chandur is connected with the Great Indian Peninsula Railway at Amraoti station, and draws a considerable traffic (especially sugar) from the Districts of the Central Provinces above the Ghats on the north. Dispensary, post-office, school, and police station.\n\nChandur.\u2014Taluk of Amraoti District, Berar. Area, 855 square miles; contains 2 towns and 296 villages. Population (1881) 171,611, namely, 88,813 males and 82,798 females, or 200\u00b771 persons per square mile. The population deriving their livelihood entirely from the soil numbered 130,437, or 76 per cent. of the total population; average area of cultivated and cultivable land, 3\u00b796 acres per head of the agricultural population. Of the area of 855 square miles, 792 square miles are assessed for Government revenue, of which 666 square miles were under cultivation in 1881; 111 square miles are returned as cultivable, and only 15 square miles as uncultivable and waste. Total amount of Government assessment in 1881, including local rates and cesses paid on land, \u00a340,547, or an average of 2s. 1\u00bdd. per cultivated acre. The total revenue of the taluk amounted to \u00a348,846. It contains 1 civil and 2 criminal courts, with 5 police stations (thandas); strength of regular police, 84 men; village watchmen (chaukidars), 267.\n\nChandur.\u2014Town in Amraoti District, Berar, and head-quarters of the Chandur Sub-division.

Travellers' bungalow near the station.\n\n**Ch\u00e1nd\u00faria.**\u2014Trading village and municipality in Khuln\u00e1 District, Bengal; situated on the east bank of the Ichh\u00e1m\u00e1t\u00ed. Lat. 22\u00b0 54\u2032 45\u2033 N.; long. 88\u00b0 56\u2032 45\u2033 E. Population (1881) 3334. Municipal income in 1881-82, \u00a3248; average rate of taxation, 1s. 4\u00bdd. per head of population.\n\n**Ch\u00e1ndwar.**\u2014Sub-division and town in Nasik District, Bombay Presidency.\u2014See Chandor.\n\n**Ch\u00e1ng Bhak\u00e1r.**\u2014Native State of Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur, Bengal, lying between lat. 23\u00b0 29\u2032 and 23\u00b0 55\u2032 30\u2033 N., and long. 81\u00b0 37\u2032 and 82\u00b0 23\u2032 30\u2033 E.; area, 906 square miles. Population (1881) 13,466. It forms the extreme western point of the Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur Division, projecting into the B\u00e1ghelkhand State of Rew\u00e1, which bounds it on the north-west and south; on the east, it marches with the State of Kore\u00e1, of which, until 1848, it was a feudal dependency. Like Kore\u00e1, it contains large areas of coal-bearing rocks, and good coal has been found by the Geological Survey. The general aspect of Ch\u00e1ng Bhak\u00e1r is that of a dense and tangled mass of hills, ravines, and plateaux, covered with s\u00e1l jungle, and dotted at intervals with small villages. The most prominent of the hill ranges takes a serpentine sweep from north-east to south-west, and rises in occasional peaks to upwards of 3000 feet above sea-level. The scenery in the interior of the country is for the most part monotonous. Hill after hill repeats the same general outline, and is clothed with the same sombre masses of s\u00e1l foliage. Portions of both northern and southern frontiers rise into bold cliffs, and seem to present an almost inaccessible barrier to a hostile advance. Notwithstanding these strong natural defences, the State suffered so seriously in former days from Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 and Pind\u00e1ri inroads, that the chief granted eight of his frontier villages to influential R\u00e1jputs of Rew\u00e1 to secure their co-operation against the marauders. The only rivers in the State are two unnavigable hill streams, the Ban\u00e1s and the Neur, both of which take their rise in the range separating Ch\u00e1ng Bhak\u00e1r from Kore\u00e1. The s\u00e1l forests are largely resorted to during the hot weather as grazing grounds; and a tax imposed on all cattle entering the country for this purpose forms the principal source of the R\u00e1j\u00e1's income. Tigers, bears, and leopards abound; and wild elephants, till recently, committed such serious ravages among the crops as to cause the abandonment of several villages. The Bhaya, or Chief, of Ch\u00e1ng Bhak\u00e1r is a R\u00e1jput by caste, belonging to a collateral branch of the Kore\u00e1 R\u00e1j\u00e1s. His residence is in the village of Janakpur, a mere collection of wretched huts. The Chief's dwelling is a double-storied range of mud buildings enclosing a courtyard. His annual revenue is returned at \u00a3300; tribute, \u00a338. The population in 1881, classified\naccording to religion, comprised 13,421 Hindus and 45 Muhammadans. The Dravidian Gonds form the most influential race in the State, but neither they nor the other aboriginal tribes are returned separately in the Census Report, State by State, and are apparently included as Hindus by religion. Among the Kolarian tribes are a curious race, called Mu\u00e1sis or Kurus, who are identified by Colonel Dalton with the Kurs of Bet\u00fal, Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d, and Nim\u00e1r in the Central Provinces. Their deities are derived from Hindu mythology, and in social customs they partly conform to Hinduism and partly to Gond practices. In 1870-71, the remains of extensive rock excavations, supposed to be temples with monasteries attached, were discovered near the village of Harchoka in the north of the State. It is inferred that these remains, together with the fine old mango groves found here and there in the heart of the jungles, were the work of a more civilised race than the present inhabitants of Ch\u00e1ng Bhak\u00e1r. The Kols and Gonds neither build temples nor plant groves; and the existence of such remains would seem to point to either a previous Aryan occupation, or to the ascendancy of one of the highly-civilised Central Indian Gond kingdoms, which were swept away by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s towards the end of the eighteenth century. The aboriginal races are generally poor, and their crops barely suffice for their actual requirements. Their ordinary clothing consists of little more than a waist-cloth; but on festivals the Kolarians appear in clean white clothing, while the Gonds affect colours. The Hindus are generally well dressed, and the better classes of all castes wear quilted garments of dark-coloured cotton, with caps to match. Two hill passes lead into the State, which is intersected by two jungle roads.\n\n**Changrezhing.**\u2014Village in Bashahr State, Punjab, near the north-eastern frontier, dividing that principality from Chinese territory, 3 miles east of the Li, or river of Spiti. Lat. 32\u00b0 3' N., long. 78\u00b0 40' E. Inhabited in summer only by peasants from the neighbouring hamlet of Chango. Forms, according to Thornton, the farthest eastern limit of European exploration in this direction, the Chinese population of the adjacent country vigilantly interfering with all further progress.\n\n**Changsil.**\u2014Range of mountains in Bashahr State, Punjab, lying between 30\u00b0 56' and 31\u00b0 20' N. lat., and between 77\u00b0 54' and 78\u00b0 12' E. long.

Traversed by numerous passes, having elevations of between 13,000 and 14,000 feet above the sea.\n\n**Channagiri.**\u2014T\u00e1luk in Shimoga District, Mysore State. Area, 467 square miles; population (1881) 66,082, namely, males 32,548, and females 33,534. Hindus numbered 61,360; Muhammadans, 4405; and Christians, 317. The south and west of the t\u00e1luk are crossed by lines of\nhills, the streams from which unite to form the great Sulekere tank, 40 miles in circumference, and thence flow northwards as a single stream, the Haridra, into the Tungabhadra. The remainder of the taluk consists of open country, with extensive grazing grounds. The northern tract is exceptionally fertile, and contains much garden and sugar-cane cultivation. Total revenue (1883-84) \u00a312,390, of which \u00a39247 was derived from the land-tax. The taluk contains 1 criminal court, with 6 police stations (th\u00e1n\u00e1s); strength of regular police, 56 men; village watchmen (chaukid\u00e1rs).\n\nChannagiri.\u2014Village in Shimoga District, Mysore State, and headquarters of Channagiri taluk; 25 miles by road north-east of Shimoga.

Municipal revenue, \u00a350; rate of taxation, 2d. per head. The fort was built about 1580 by Jaga deva R\u00e1yal, who founded a family that ruled until 1630, when they were overthrown by the Wodeyar of Mysore. It now contains a palace erected by a relative of the late Mahar\u00e1j\u00e1, but has been much depopulated by fever. Sukrav\u00e1rpet, lying to the north-east, is celebrated for the manufacture of lacquered ware and toys, fine steel wire for strings of musical instruments, and glass bracelets. It contains a large number of Muhammadans belonging to the Labbay and D\u00e1ira classes, who trade with the western coast. North of the p\u00e9t are two large Mus\u00e1lm\u00e1n tombs\u2014one erected to the memory of the religious preceptor of Tip\u00fa, the other for a commandant of Bangalore, who was distinguished for his humanity to Tip\u00fa's British prisoners. Until 1873, head-quarters of a taluk of the same name.\n\nChanr\u00e1ypatna.\u2014Taluk or Sub-division in Hassan District, Mysore State. Area, 454 square miles; population (1881) 62,209, namely, males 29,288, and females 32,921. Hindus numbered 61,047; Muhammadans, 958; and Christians, 204. The taluk drains southwards to the Hemavati river, and contains many large tanks. The country is generally open and well cultivated, the principal hills being the isolated Jain settlement of Sr\u00e1van Belgola. The soil, except in the north-east where it is shallow and stony, is generally fertile, and produces the usual 'wet' and 'dry' crops. Land revenue (1881), exclusive of water-rates, \u00a311,326.\n\nChanr\u00e1ypatna.\u2014Village in Hassan District, Mysore State, and head-quarters of Chanr\u00e1ypatna tahsil; 24 miles by road east of\nHassan.

Originally called Kolat\u00far, the name was changed in 1600 by a local chief, who erected a temple to Chenna R\u00e1ya Sw\u00e1m\u00ed or Vishnu, after whom his own son had been named. The fort was built subsequently, and Haidar \u00c1l\u00ed added the wet moat and traverse gateways. Small articles of silk are made by the Musalm\u00e1ns.\n\nCh\u00e1nsama.\u2014Town in the territory of the G\u00e1\u00e9kw\u00e1r of Baroda, Guj\u00e1r\u00e1t (Guz\u00e9r\u00e1t) Province, Bombay Presidency.

It has also a station of the German Lutheran Mission. Chapr\u00e1 has suffered much commercially from the recession of the Ganges, which formerly flowed close under the town; while its main channel is now a mile distant in the cold weather. It is still, however, a place of importance, and contains many wealthy native banking houses. Goods of all kinds are obtainable in the b\u00e1z\u00e1r, pottery and brass utensils forming a specialty. At the end of the last century, the French, Dutch, and Portuguese had factories at Chapr\u00e1. The District of S\u00e1ran was then famed for its saltpetre, and the Chapr\u00e1 mark was especially esteemed; but this trade has been on the decline for many years past. Roads radiate from Chapr\u00e1 to Sonpur, Muzaffarpur, Motihari, Sew\u00e1n, and Guthn\u00ed.

About 150 years ago, the original inhabitants received among them the J\u00e1ts of M\u00edrpur, who had been almost ruined by the incursions of the Sikhs; and since that time the town has largely increased. Agricultural centre, without trade or manufactures. B\u00e1z\u00e1r, sard\u00ed, police station, post-office.\n\n**Charam\u00e1i.** \u2014 Lake in Bashahr State, Punjab; near the summit of the Barenda Pass, at an elevation of 13,839 feet above sea-level.

Massive beds of snow surround the lake, while others\nform a natural bridge over the P\u00e1bur, or hem it in with frozen cliffs of ice.\n\n**Ch\u00e1r\u00e1punji.** \u2014 Town in the Kh\u00e1s\u00ed Hills, Assam. \u2014 See Cherra Poonjee.\n\n**Charda.** \u2014 Pargan\u00e1 in Bahraich District, Oudh; bounded on the north by Nep\u00e1l State, the R\u00e1pti river marking the boundary line; on the east by Bhinga pargan\u00e1; and on the south and west by N\u00e1np\u00e1r\u00e1. The history of this pargan\u00e1 is virtually that of Nanpara. Occupied successively by hill chieftains, the Ikauna family, and the Sayyids, it was finally bestowed upon a relative of the N\u00e1np\u00e1r\u00e1 R\u00e1j\u00e1, and held by him and his descendants till 1857, when the estate was confiscated for the rebellion of its holder, and conferred upon loyal grantees. It is intersected by the Bhakl\u00e1 river, which divides it into two distinct tracts. The country between the Bhakl\u00e1 and the R\u00e1pti lies low, and has a rich alluvial soil. The tract west of the Bhakl\u00e1 forms a portion of the tableland described under Bahraich pargan\u00e1. Area, 206 square miles, of which 142 are under cultivation, and 51 cultivable waste. Government land revenue, \u00a313,253; average incidence, 2s. 11\u00bdd. per acre of cultivated area, 2s. 4\u00bdd. per acre of assessable area, and 2s. 2\u00bdd. per acre of total area.

This reserve includes an experimental plantation of caoutchouc trees (Ficus elastica), covering an area of 803 acres. The proportion of failure among the seedlings and cuttings has been about 18 per cent.\n\n**Charkha.** \u2014 Petty State in South K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Gujar\u00e1t (Guzer\u00e1t) Province, Bombay Presidency; consisting of one village, with 4 independent tribute-payers. Estimated revenue (1881) \u00a31200. Tribute of \u00a350, 6s. is paid to the Gaekw\u00e1r, and \u00a33, 16s. to Jun\u00e1garh.\n\n**Charkh\u00e1ri.** \u2014 Native State in Bundelkhand, under the Central India Agency and the Government of India; lying between 25\u00b0 21' and 25\u00b0 36' N. lat., and between 79\u00b0 40' and 79\u00b0 58' E long.

The present Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 (1883), Dhir\u00e1j J\u00e1i Singh Deo, was born about 1853. Like all the Bundela chiefs, he is descended from R\u00e1j\u00e1 Chattar S\u00e1l. His ancestor, Bij\u00ed Bah\u00e1dur, was the first who submitted to the authority of the British; a sanad confirming\nhim in his principality was granted to him in 1804, and confirmed in 1811. His successor remained faithful to the British Government during the Mutiny, protecting European officers and native officials. In reward for his services, he was granted the privilege of adoption, a j\u00e1gir of \u00a32000 a year in perpetuity, a dress of honour, and a salute of 11 guns. The revenue of the State is 5 l\u00fakhs of rupees per annum (say \u00a350,000).\n\n**Charkh\u00e1ri.**\u2014Chief town of Charkh\u00e1ri State in Bundelkhand, Central India; situated on the route from Gwalior to B\u00e1n\u00e1da, 41 miles from the latter place. Lat. 25\u00b0 24' N.; long. 79\u00b0 47' E. Occupies a picturesque site at the base of a high rocky hill surmounted by a fort, to which access can be obtained only through a flight of steps cut in the rock, on such a scale as to be practicable for elephants. Two neighbouring elevations command the fortress for all purposes of modern warfare. Below the town lies a large lake; good roads, embowered among trees, lead from it in all directions; and a tank, commenced as a relief work, irrigates the surrounding fields.\n\n**Charm\u00e1di** (or Kodekal; called also the Bund or Coffee Gh\u00e1t).\u2014Pass in the Uppanagadi t\u00e1luk, South K\u00e1nara District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 13\u00b0 4' 30\" N.; long. 75\u00b0 27' 0\" E. Opened in 1864, and now one of the main lines for wheeled traffic, and specially for coffee transport between Mangalore and Mysore.\n\n**Charmunsha.**\u2014Town in the head-quarters Sub-division of No\u00e1kh\u00e1li District, Bengal. Population (1881) 7363, namely, 3638 males and 3725 females.\n\n**Charr\u00e1.**\u2014Village in M\u00e1nbh\u00fam District, Bengal. Lat. 23\u00b0 23' 0\" N.; long. 86\u00b0 27' 30\" E. Situated near Puruli\u00e1 town, and containing two very old Jain temples, called deuls or dev\u00falayas, built of roughly-cut stone, without cement, and clamped together with iron bands. There were originally seven of these temples, but five have fallen into ruins, and the fragments have been used for building houses in the village. Of the remaining two, the most perfect is tower-shaped, terminating in a dome of horizontal courses of stone about 30 feet high, with a circular finial like a huge cog-wheel, and the remains of flag-roofed colonnades on both sides. The slabs forming the roof are great blocks of granite from 5 to 9 feet in length, 2 to 2\u00bd in breadth, and 1 foot thick. There is no carving about the temples, nor any object of worship in the shrines; but on the stones scattered about, traces of the nude Tirthankaras, or Jain deified saints, are visible. The construction of some large ancient tanks in the vicinity is also attributed to the Sr\u00e1wak Jains.\n\n**Ch\u00e1rsadda.**\u2014Town in Pesh\u00e1war District, Punjab, and head-quarters of the H\u00e1shtnagar tahs\u00edl, situated on the left bank of the Sw\u00e1t river, 16 miles north-east of Pesh\u00e1war, in lat. 34\u00b0 9' N.; long. 71\u00b0 46' 30\" E.\nPopulation (1881) 8363, namely, 7892 Muhammadans and 471 Hindus; number of occupied houses, 1438. The town is not fortified, and is connected by road with Peshawar, Mardan, and the Naushahra railway station on the Northern Punjab State Railway. It is a large and prosperous agricultural village rather than a town, but contains several enterprising Hindu traders. Charsadda is almost contiguous to the considerable village of Prang; and these two places are identified by General Cunningham with the ancient Pushkalavati, capital of the surrounding region at the time of Alexander's invasion, and transliterated as Peukelas or Peukelaotis by the Greek historians. Its chieftain (Astes), according to Arrian, was killed in defence of one of his strongholds after a prolonged siege by Hephaestion. Ptolemy fixes its site upon the eastern bank of the Suastene or Swat. In the 7th century A.D., Huen Thsang visited the city, which he describes as being 100 li (16\\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) miles) north-east of Peshawar. A stupa or tower, erected over the spot where Buddha made an alms-offering of his eyes, formed the great attraction for the Buddhist pilgrim and his co-religionists. The city, however, had even then been abandoned as a political capital, in favour of Parashawara or Peshawar. It probably extended over a large area. The entire neighbourhood is, according to General Court, covered with vast ruins.\n\nCharthawal.\u2014Town in Muzaffarnagar District, North-Western Provinces. Lat. 29\u00b0 32' 30\" N.; long. 77\u00b0 38' 10\" E. Population (1881) 5300, namely, 3302 Hindus, 1958 Muhammadans, and 40 Jains. Police station, post-office. Distant from Muzaffarnagar 7 miles west, from the Hindan river 3 miles east, and from the Kali Nadi 6 miles west. Once the residence of an amil, but now a small agricultural town. A small municipal revenue in the form of a house-tax is raised for police and conservancy purposes.\n\nChata (Chhata).\u2014Tahsil of Muttra (Mathura) District, North-Western Provinces, lying in the centre of the trans-Jumna portion, and traversed by the Agra Canal. It forms part of the Braj-Mandal of ancient Hindu topography, one of the earliest settlements colonized by the Aryan immigrants into India. Although the tahsil is situated between the Bhartpur hills on the extreme west and the range of sand-hills and ravines that slope down to the valley of the Jumna on the east, the surface is exceptionally level and uniform. Not a single natural river or stream passes through it, but the Agra Canal, which intersects it from north to south, together with wells, affords facilities for irrigation. The soil is, generally speaking, a light but strong loam, which contains a sufficient admixture of sand to render it friable and easily worked, while there is enough clay to give it body. Area (1881) 251\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) square miles, of which 187 square miles were under cultivation, 49 square miles cultivable, and 15\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) square miles uncultivable. Popu-\nlation 84,598, residing in 106 villages. Hindus numbered 76,087; Muhammadans, 7605; and Jains, 6. Up to a very recent period almost the whole of the tahsil was pasture and woodland; and in consequence of the demand for cultivators to open up the soil, the unusual feature is reported that tenants with occupancy rights pay an average rental about 10 per cent. more than that paid by tenants-at-will. The land revenue in 1881-82 amounted to \u00a320,262; total Government revenue, including rates and cesses, \u00a323,055; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a336,856. The tahsil contained in 1883, 1 criminal court and 3 police stations (th\u00e1n\u00e1s); strength of regular police, 36 men; village watchmen (chaukid\u00e1rs), 182.\n\nCh\u00e1ta.\u2014Town in Muttra District, North-Western Provinces, and head-quarters of Ch\u00e1ta tahsil. Lat. 27\u00b0 43' N.; long. 77\u00b0 32' 50\" E. Distant 9 miles west of the Jumna, and on the northern border of the pargan\u00e1, 21 miles north-west from Muttra town. Area, 94 acres; population (1881) 6014, namely, 4958 Hindus and 1056 Muhammadans. A small municipal revenue in the shape of a house-tax is levied under the provisions of Act xx. of 1856 for police and conservancy purposes. The principal feature of the town is its large fort-like sar\u00e1i, covering an area of over 6 acres, with battlemented walls and bastions, and two lofty entrance gateways of decorated stone-work, dating from the time of Sher Sh\u00e1h or Akbar. During the Mutiny of 1857, it was occupied by the rebels, who, however, had to blow one of the towers down before they could effect an entrance. The town contains a second-class police station, imperial post-office, school, and encamping ground for troops. Weekly market held every Friday.\n\nChat\u00e1ri.\u2014Village in Kh\u00farja tahsil, Bulandshahr District, North-Western Provinces, situated on the Al\u00edgarh road, 21 miles east of Kh\u00farja town. A prosperous village, and site of a large weekly cattle market. Good school; post-office.\n\nCh\u00e1tin\u00e1.\u2014Village and head-quarters of a police outpost, in B\u00e1nkur\u00e1 District, Bengal. Lat. 23\u00b0 18' 30\" N.; long. 87\u00b0 0' 20\" E.\n\nChatr\u00e1.\u2014Town in Haz\u00e1r\u00edb\u00e1gh District, Bengal; situated about 36 miles north-west of Haz\u00e1r\u00edb\u00e1gh town. Lat. 24\u00b0 12' 27\" N.; long. 84\u00b0 55' E. The chief market of the District, carrying on a considerable trade with Loh\u00e1rdag\u00e1, Gay\u00e1, Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d, Patn\u00e1, Bardw\u00e1n, and Calcutta. A large cattle fair, held annually during the Dasahar\u00e1 festival, is attended by butchers from Calcutta. Population (1881), Hindus, 8833; Muhammadans, 3058; 'others,' 9; total, 11,900, namely, 5613 males and 6287 females. Municipal income (1881-82) \u00a3488; average incidence of taxation, 9\u00bdd. per head. On the 2nd October 1857, an engagement took place at Chatr\u00e1 between H.M.'s 53rd Foot\u2014supported by a detachment of Rattray's Sikhs\u2014and the R\u00e1mgarh Battalion, which had mutinied at R\u00e1nch\u00ed, and was marching to join the rebel zamind\u00e1r.\nKunw\u00e1r (Kooer) Singh at Bhojpur in Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d. The mutineers, posted in great force on the brow of a hill, made a stubborn resistance, but were defeated with a loss of 40 men and all their supplies.\n\n**Chatrapur.**\u2014State and town in Bundelkhand, North-Western Provinces.\u2014See Chhatarpur.\n\n**Chatrapur** *(Chetterpur, Satrap\u00faram).*\u2014Town in Ganj\u00e1m District, Madras Presidency; situated 19 miles north-east of Barhampur (Berhampur), and 5 miles distant from Ganj\u00e1m town. Lat. $19^\\circ 21' N.$, long. $85^\\circ 3' E.$ The residence of the Collector of the District, and of the Superintendent of Police. There is a school here, endowed by a late Collector, Mr. A. P. Onslow, with some house property, which includes the house usually occupied by the Collector. The oldest rooms in this house were built by Captain Evans, who managed a horse-breeding establishment here, which was broken up about 1814, after an existence of sixteen years. A weekly market is held on Thursdays, when native cloths and other goods are brought from Berhampur and Ganj\u00e1m for sale. Provisions for Europeans have usually to be brought from Berhampur, and even for natives the b\u00e1z\u00e1r is but indifferently supplied. The public buildings consist of a subsidiary jail, the police hospital and police lines, and the Collector's court.\n\n**Ch\u00e1tsu.**\u2014Town in Jaipur State, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na; distant about 24 miles south-east from Jaipur, on the Agra and Nas\u00edr\u00e1bd route. An important town, in which eight annual fairs are held, most of them largely attended. A dispensary is maintained here by the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1.\n\n**Chaug\u00e1chh\u00e1.**\u2014Village in Jess\u00f3r District, Bengal; situated on the bank of the Kabadak river. A sugar manufacturing and refining village, surrounded by groves of date palms.\n\n**Chaugh\u00e1t** *(Ch\u00e1vakk\u00e1d).*\u2014Formerly a t\u00e1luk of Malab\u00e1r District, Madras Presidency; but in 1860 amalgamated with Kutn\u00e1d and Vettat\u00e1n\u00e1d t\u00e1lukas, and formed into the present t\u00e1luk of Pon\u00e1n\u00ed (*q.v.*).\n\n**Chaugh\u00e1t** *(Ch\u00e1vakk\u00e1d).*\u2014Town in the Pon\u00e1n\u00ed t\u00e1luk, Malab\u00e1r District, Madras Presidency. Lat. $10^\\circ 35' N.$, long. $76^\\circ 3' 51'' E.$; houses, 1057; population (1881) 5533, namely, 2768 Hindus, 1712 Muhammadans, and 1055 Christians. Formerly the head-quarters of the Chavakk\u00e1d (Chaughat) t\u00e1luk, and still containing subordinate judicial and administrative offices; local funds school, etc.\n\n**Chauka.**\u2014River in Oudh; one of the names assumed by the Sarda in the lower part of its course through Kheri and S\u00edt\u00e1pur Districts; afterwards becoming the Dahaur, and ultimately joining the Kauri\u00e1la at Kutai Gh\u00e1t, where it becomes the Gogra or Ghagra.\u2014See Sarda and Ghogra.\n\n**Chaukid\u00e1ng\u00e1.**\u2014Mine in the R\u00e1n\u00edganj coal tract, Bardw\u00e1n District, Bengal; situated in the Sing\u00e1ran valley; total thickness of seam, consisting of alternate layers of coal and shale, 15 feet 9 inches; thickness\nof coal in seam, 14 feet 6 inches. This colliery was first worked in 1834; in 1861 much damage was caused by fire, owing to the liability of the R\u00e1niganj coal to spontaneous combustion. The mine was closed about 1878, and up to 1883 had not been re-opened.\n\n**Chaul (Cheul, or Revdanda).**\u2014Town in Alib\u00e1gh Sub-division, Kol\u00e1ba District, Bombay Presidency. Lat. 18\u00b0 33' N., long. 73\u00b0 0' E. Population (1881) 5355, namely, Hindus, 5282; Muhammadans, 30; and 'others,' 43. Area of town site, 2871 acres. Situated on the coast about 30 miles south of Bombay, and on the right bank of the Kundalika river, or Roha creek. Chaul is a place of great antiquity. Under the names of Champ\u00e1vati and Revatikshetra, local Hindu traditions trace it to the times when Krishna reigned in Gujar\u00e1t, B.C. 1200 (?). It seems probable that Chaul or Cheul is Ptolemy's (A.D. 150) headland and emporium of Symulla or Tymulla; and it has a special interest, as Ptolemy mentions that he gained information about Western India from people who had come from Symulla to Alexandria. About a hundred years later (A.D. 247), it appears in the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea as Semulla, the first local mart south of Kalliena; and in 642 it is called Chimolo by Hwen Thsang. Chaul next appears under the names Saimur and Jaimur in the writings of the Arab travellers of the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth centuries. The Russian traveller Athanasius Nikitin (1470) calls it Chivil. Thirty-five years later (1505) the Portuguese first appeared at Chaul, and a few years after were allowed to build a factory there. In 1583 the Dutch traveller Jean Hugues de Linschot described Chaul as a fortified city with a good harbour, and famous for trade. It was then a great centre of manufactures, with very dextrous and hard-working craftsmen, who made a great number of chests and Chinese-like cabinets, very rich and well wrought, and beds and couches lacquered in all colours. There was also a great weaving industry in cotton and silk. As late as 1668 (Bruce's Annals), the weavers of Chaul are mentioned as making 5000 pieces of taffaties a year.\n\nThe insecurity of native rule at Chaul was of great advantage to Bombay. The silk-weavers and other skilled craftsmen of the town were induced to settle in Bombay, where the first street was built to receive them; and their descendants of several castes, copper-smiths, weavers, and carpenters, are still known as Chaulis, thus preserving the name of their old home. Upper and Lower Chaul, or, as they are more often called, Cheul and Revdanda, are among the prettiest and most interesting places in Kol\u00e1ba District, and can be reached either by land from Alib\u00e1gh, or by sea. The beginning of the 7 miles of land journey from Alib\u00e1gh is made troublesome by the Alib\u00e1gh creek, but beyond the creek most of the way lies through shady palm groves. Except the Portuguese ruins in Revdanda or Lower Chaul, the Musalm\u00e1n mosque, baths, and castle of R\u00e1jkot in\nOld or Upper Chaul, and the Buddhist caves in the south and southwest faces of the hills, Chaul has now few objects of interest.\n\n**Chaumuh\u00e1.**\u2014Agricultural village in *tahsil* Ch\u00e1ta, Muttra (Mathur\u00e1) District, North-Western Provinces, situated 8 miles south-east from Ch\u00e1ta town, on the metalled road from Muttra to Delhi. Population (1881) 2275, chiefly Gauria Thak\u00fars. Weekly market held on Tuesdays.\n\n**Chaum\u00fan.**\u2014Town in Jaipur State, R\u00e1jput\u00e1n\u00e1. Distant about 18 miles north of the city of Jaipur, and the seat of the Thak\u00far of this name, the premier noble of the State. A large, flourishing, and fortified town. Dispensary, maintained by the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1.\n\n**Chaur, The.**\u2014Peak in Sirmur (Sarmor) State, Punjab, forming the highest summit among the mountains which occupy the sub-Him\u00e1layan tract, with an elevation of 11,982 feet above the sea. Lat. 30\u00b0 52' N.; long. 77\u00b0 32' E. From its peculiar shape and great height it forms a conspicuous element in the landscape for many miles around, being easily recognised amongst the smaller ridges on every side. The Chaur presents a striking appearance from the plains of Sirhind, and the view from its summit embraces the vast lowland tract on the south, and a wide panorama of the snowy range to the northward. Though below the limit of perpetual snow, drifts remain in the shady chasms on its flanks throughout the summer months. A dense forest of *deod\u00e1rs* and other conifers clothe the northern and north-eastern declivities, and rhododendrons, ferns, or gentians grow in patches on the detritus of its granite slopes.\n\n**Chaur\u00e1d\u00e1dar.**\u2014Hill plateau in the east of Mandl\u00e1 District, Central Provinces; upwards of 3200 feet above sea-level. The winter nights are intensely cold, and in the hottest days of April and May the heat is not excessive. Water is abundant; and, but for its inaccessibility, Chaur\u00e1d\u00e1dar might prove an excellent sanitarium.\n\n**Chaur\u00e1gahr.**\u2014Ruined fortress in Narsinghpur District, Central Provinces; on the crest of the outer range of the S\u00e1tpura table-land, 800 feet above the level of the Narbad\u00e1 (Nerbudda) valley, and 22 miles south-west of Narsinghpur. Lat. 22\u00b0 46' N.; long. 78\u00b0 59' E. The northern, eastern, and western faces of the fort are scarped for several hundred feet; while to the south a small hill has been fortified as an outwork. The circuit of defences embraces two hills, divided by a dip of about 100 yards. On one of these stand the ruins of the palace of the old Gond R\u00e1j\u00e1s, and on the other the remains of barracks built by the N\u00e1gpur Government. Numerous tanks yield a constant supply of water; and the exterior walls are still good in many parts. There are three approaches.\n\n**Chauri\u00e1.**\u2014Small estate or *zam\u00ednd\u00e1ri* in Beh\u00edr *tahsil*, B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t District, Central Provinces. Area (1881) 25 square miles; number of\nvillages, 12; occupied houses, 101; population (1881) 526. A wild jungle tract, the grant of which to the holder appears to have been made on condition of his guarding the neighbouring hill passes.\n\n**Chaus\u00e1.**\u2014Village and police outpost station in Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Bengal, and a station on the East Indian Railway; 4 miles west of Bax\u00e1r town, and close to the east bank of the Karamn\u00e1s\u00e1. Population (1881) 2484. Noted as the scene of the defeat of the Emperor Hum\u00e1yun by the Afgh\u00e1n Sher Sh\u00e1h, in June 1539. The Emperor, with a few friends, was barely able to escape by crossing the Ganges, but 8000 Mughal troops perished in the attempt. In the following year, after a second defeat of Hum\u00e1yun near Kanauj, Sher Sh\u00e1h ascended the Imperial throne of Delhi.\n\n**Chaus\u00e1.**\u2014Canal in Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Bengal; a branch of the Son (Soane) Canal system, leaving the Buxar Canal at the second mile, which latter takes off from the Main Western Canal at the 12th mile from the headworks at Dehri. The canal, which is 40 miles in length, is designed for irrigation purposes only, and has a discharge of 545 cubic feet of water per second. Capable of irrigating 43,600 acres of kharif and 98,100 acres of rabi crops.\n\n**Ch\u00e1vakk\u00e1d.**\u2014Town and tiluk in Malab\u00e1r District, Madras Presidency.\u2014See Chaughat.\n\n**Chawindah.**\u2014Village in Zaffarw\u00e1l tahsil, Si\u00e1lkot District, Punjab. Lat. 32\u00b0 20' 45\" N.; long. 74\u00b0 45' 15\" E. Distant from Si\u00e1lkot 14 miles south-east, on the road to Zaffarw\u00e1l. Purely agricultural community, consisting chiefly of Bajwa J\u00e1ts, the proprietors of the surrounding lands.\n\n**Chedambaram.**\u2014Town and shrine in South Arcot District, Madras Presidency.\u2014See Chidambaram.\n\n**Cheduba** (or Man-aung).\u2014Island on the east coast of the Bay of Bengal, forming a township in Kyauk-py\u00fa District, Arakan, British Burma. Lat. 18\u00b0 40' to 18\u00b0 56' 30\" N.; long. 93\u00b0 30' to 93\u00b0 47' E.; population (1881) 23,867; area, 240 square miles. Head-quarters at Cheduba or Man-aung. The general appearance and character of Cheduba are those of a fertile, well-wooded island. A narrow plain, slightly above the sea-level, extends round the coast; within lie irregular, low, undulating hills, varying in height from 50 to 500 feet, enclosing several detached mounds (the highest about 1400 feet), with steep, well-wooded sides. In the extreme north-west corner is a so-called 'volcano,' from which flames issue, but which are really due to a copious discharge of inflammable gas, and not to volcanic action. Petroleum is found in several places on the island. A considerable quantity of rice is exported coastwise; and Cheduba is noted for the excellence of its tobacco. The township is divided into 8 revenue circles; the gross revenue realized in 1881-82 was \u00a35217. Two derivations are given\nfor the name 'Man-aung,' which signifies 'overcoming of the evil disposition.' According to ancient tradition, a governor of the island, appointed by San-da-r\u00e1 I., King of Arakan, who reigned some 2000 years B.C., so oppressed the people, that they complained to the sovereign, who summoned the governor to appear before him. On the governor refusing to attend the court, the monarch struck the sea with a rod, and ordered it to bring his disobedient subject into his presence. The sea obeyed, and in a few days the dead body of the rebel was washed ashore near the royal city. According to another account, the island was the place of transportation for those considered to be politically dangerous, whose evil disposition was thus overcome by their being rendered powerless. The classical name is Mek-ka-wa-d\u00ed. The name Cheduba, by which the island is known to Europeans and natives of India, is said to be a corruption of Char-dhuba, or 'four capes,' from the headlands at the four corners of the island. A shoal, with probably only two or three fathoms at low water, has lately been discovered 8 miles to the north-west of Beacon Island, Cheduba. In October 1878, the Government deemed it necessary to warn mariners that 'the whole of the neighbourhood of Cheduba and R\u00e1mri (Ramree) islands is imperfectly known, and careful navigation is necessary.'\n\n**Cheduba** (or Man-aung).\u2014Small town, situated on the Un river, in the north-west of the island of the same name in Kyauk-py\u00fa District, Arakan Division, British Burma. Population (1881) 1032. Contains a court-house, market, school, and police station.\n\n**Chellakere.**\u2014Village in Chitaldr\u00fag (Chitaldroog) District, Mysore State; 18 miles east-north-east by road from Chitaldr\u00fag. Lat. 14\u00b0 18' N., long. 76\u00b0 43' E.; population (1881) 1513; municipal revenue (1874\u201375) \u00a311; rate of taxation, 2d. per head. The inhabitants are mostly Ling\u00e1yat traders, to whom belongs the chief building in the place, the temple of Chellakere-amma. Head-quarters of the Dodderi taluk.\n\n**Chellapalli.**\u2014Town in Kistna District, Madras Presidency. Population (1881) 5615, namely, 5118 Hindus and 497 Muhammadans; houses, 586.\n\n**Chen\u00e1b (Chind\u00e1b).**\u2014River in the Punjab, and one of the five streams from which the Province derives its name. Rises in the snowy Him\u00e1layan ranges of Kashm\u00edr; pursues a winding course through the gorges of Jammu; and enters British territory in Si\u00e1lkot District, near the village of Kh\u00e1iri Rih\u00e1l. Receives the waters of the T\u00e1vi, a considerable confluent, and forms for some 18 miles the boundary between Si\u00e1lkot and Gujar\u00e1t Districts. Flows in this portion of its route through the alluvial plain of the Punjab, in a wide and shifting bed of sand. It afterwards forms the limit between the Rechn\u00e1 and the Jech Do\u00e1bs, where many flat-bottomed country boats navigate its stream. A belt of low-lying alluvial soil fringes either bank for some miles inland; but\nbeyond this narrow zone, the water of the river becomes practically useless for purposes of irrigation. Passing along the whole western border of Gujr\u00e1nw\u00e1la District, the Chen\u00e1b next enters the desert region of Jhang, where it occupies a broad valley, nearly 30 miles in width, consisting of modern deposits, through which the changing stream cuts itself a fresh channel from time to time. The present bed lies about midway between the high banks which confine the central valley at either end. The shores are for the most part cultivated down to the water's edge, the area under tillage having considerably increased since the settlement of the country. Numerous islands stud the river, but constantly change their places with every inundation. The depth of the stream is here about 10 feet during the cold weather, rising to 16 feet in the rainy season. At Timmu, the Chen\u00e1b and the Jehlam (Jhelum) unite. A railway bridge crosses the Chen\u00e1b at Waz\u00edr\u00e1b\u00e1d; and a bridge of boats conveys the road from Jhang to Der\u00e1 Ism\u00e1il Kh\u00e1n.\n\n**Chen\u00e1ri.**\u2014Village in Sasseram Sub-division, Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Bengal. Population (1881) 2536, namely, 1844 males and 1692 females. A municipal union, with an income in 1881\u201382 of \u00a382.\n\n**Chendi\u00e1.**\u2014Seaport in North K\u00e1nara District, Bombay Presidency. The creek where goods are landed, called Aligaddi, is 6 miles south of K\u00e1rw\u00e1r; and the village of Chendi\u00e1 is about a mile and a half inland.\n\n**Chendw\u00e1r.**\u2014Hill in Haz\u00e1rib\u00e1gh District, Bengal, near Haz\u00e1rib\u00e1gh town; height, 2816 above sea-level, and 800 feet above the elevated plateau on which it is situated. Lat. 23\u00b0 57' 15\" N., long. 85\u00b0 28' 30\" E.\n\n**Chengalpat** *(Chingleput, 'The brick town').*\u2014District in the Presidency of Madras, lying between 12\u00b0 13' and 13\u00b0 54' N. lat., and between 79\u00b0 35' and 80\u00b0 23' E. long. Extreme length, 115 miles; extreme breadth, 42 miles. Area, 2842 square miles; population (1881) 981,381 souls. In point of size, Chengalpat ranks twentieth, and in population sixteenth, among the Districts of the Madras Presidency. The Bay of Bengal bounds it on the east; on the north lies Nellore District; on the south, South Arcot; and on the west, North Arcot District. The District contains 6 towns and 1997 villages. Land revenue (1881\u201382) \u00a3177,396; total revenue, \u00a3566,287.\n\n**Physical Aspects.**\u2014The District generally presents a flat and uninteresting aspect. The land seldom rises to an elevation of more than 300 feet, and in many places near the coast it sinks below the sea-level. Long reaches of blown sand, which within the last few years have become covered with larch-like plantations of casuarina-trees, and which are often separated from the mainland by backwaters or lagoons, form the chief feature of the coast scenery. Inland, great expanses of flat rice plains, interspersed with groves of cocoa-nut and tamarind trees, in which lie the villages of the people; sandy plains, stony and gravelly wastes, and stretches of poor pasture land, covered in most\nplaces with dwarf date-trees and thorny bushes, form the principal varieties of the landscape. The dreary palmyra palm (*Borassus flabelliformis*) abounds, and long lines of these trees usually mark the situation of the dams which form the tanks used for irrigation purposes. Along the north-western corner runs the Nagalap\u00faram and K\u00e1mb\u00e1kam range, the highest point of which, the K\u00e1mb\u00e1kam-dr\u00fag, is 2548 feet. In parts of the Chengalpat and Madhur\u00e1ntakam *tiluks* the surface undulates, at times even rising into cones and ridges above 500 feet in height; but there are no other elevations deserving the name of hills. The drainage of the country is entirely from west to east, into the shallow valleys of the Nar\u00e1navaram, Cortelli\u00e1r, N\u00e1gari, and P\u00e1l\u00e1r. The soil is for the most part poor, and, where not sandy, which is generally the case, is very often either saline or stony. The principal streams are the P\u00e1l\u00e1r, Cortelli\u00e1r, Nar\u00e1navaram (known more commonly as the Ar\u00e1niy\u00e1nadi), the Chey\u00e1r, Adyar, and Cooum (Kuvam); but none are navigable, being for part of every year either empty sandbeds or trickling rivulets. The numerous backwaters along the coast are connected by canals, which run through the whole District from north to south, and to these is confined all water traffic. The canals are known as a whole by the name of the Buckingham Canal, after the Duke of Buckingham, a recent Governor of Madras. The Enn\u00far (Ennore) and the Pulicat Lake are the most important backwaters. The latter is a shallow salt-water lagoon, about 35 miles in extreme length, with a breadth varying from 3 to 11 miles, the greatest depth being about 14 to 16 feet. The coast-line measures 115 miles, and the well-known \u2018Madras surf\u2019 beats on it throughout its length. Except Pulicat, where the shelter is merely the shoal to the north-east, and Covelong, which is protected from the south by a reef, there is nothing which can pretend to the name of a harbour even for the smallest craft; but, on the other hand, there are two points of danger along the line\u2014the Pulicat shoal, and the Tirupall\u00far reef a little north of Covelong, as well as the smaller reef at the latter-mentioned place. The average depth at Nar\u00e1navar\u00e1n, 400 yards off shore, is over 20 feet, and the bottom is firm throughout. The tide rises and falls 3 feet at the full and new moons. Of mineral wealth, the District possesses little or none; laterite, for building purposes, and the Chengalpat felspar and granite, used in ornamental work, representing all its known resources.\n\nThe only forests are the comparatively poor growths on the K\u00e1mb\u00e1kam and N\u00e1galapur Hills, which have been conserved for 15 years, but as yet have yielded no revenue. But the sand-dunes along the coast, a large area occupying 20,000 acres, have within the last few years been taken up by private enterprise for *casuarina* plantations, which are extending year by year, and already occupy almost all\nthe land of this description bordering on the sea. This tree yields rapid returns, attaining in favourable localities its full growth in about fifteen years; and as there is a large and increasing demand for firewood in Madras, the enterprise has attained such proportions as to materially change the physical aspect of long stretches of the coast, which will in a few years be still more altered by this means as the plantations mature. The flora of the District includes the cocoa-nut and palmyra palms, the mango, pipal, banian, tamarind, babul (Acacia arabica), margosa, and korakapillai (Garcinia cambogia). As might be expected in a metropolitan District, closely cultivated and traversed by many roads and canals, as well as by the railway, there is no large game, excepting in the north-western part of the Kambakam range, where the sambhar, pig, and wild sheep are in considerable numbers, and leopards and bears are occasionally found. A few antelope still linger in the plains at the foot of the hills. Crocodiles in large numbers are found in the Karunguli tank, and in no other. It is not known when and how they were introduced. The tank was constructed in 1795 by the then Collector of the District, Mr. Place, and communicates with others. Snakes, as in other parts of the Presidency, are common.\n\nHistory.\u2014Chengalpat formed part of the ancient kingdom of Vijayanagar, and is studded throughout with places of historical interest; indeed, there is hardly a village within 30 miles south and west of Madras that is not mentioned by the historians of Southern India. After the overthrow of the Vijayanagar dynasty at Talikot in 1564, the Raya kings fell back on Chandragiri and Vellore; and the vicinity of Chengalpat to the latter fortress makes it probable that the power of the family extended over the present District. At any rate, when in 1639 the East India Company negotiated for the site of the present city of Madras, it was from Sri Ranga Raya that the grant was finally obtained. During the struggle between the British and the French for the mastery of the Karnatic, Chengalpat and many other towns in the District were the scene of constant fighting. In 1760, the District, or jagir, as it was then and long after called, was granted to the East India Company in perpetuity by Muhammad Ali, the Nawab of Arcot, 'for services rendered to him and his father;' and in 1763 this grant was confirmed by the Emperor Shah Alam. From 1763 till 1780 it was leased to the Nawab; and during that period was twice ravaged by Haidar Ali, once in 1768, and again in 1780. On the latter occasion, the Mysore chief almost depopulated the District; and what fire and sword had left undone, famine completed. Since that year, the history of the District consists chiefly of a chronicle of territorial arrangements and transfers. In 1784 it was divided into 14 separate farms, and rented out. Four years later it was parcelled out into collectorates, which again in 1793 were united into one 'District.' In 1801, the Sattiawad division and\nthe territory about Pulicat (ceded to the Dutch by the Naw\u00e1b) were added to Chengalpat. The former was transferred in 1804 to North Arcot, but re-united to this District, partly in 1850, when 53 of its villages were incorporated with the Ponn\u00e9ri taluk; and altogether when the remaining 90 were subsequently made over to the Tiruvall\u00far taluk. The 'home farms,' and some other villages which till 1798 formed the jurisdiction of the 'Recorder's Court,' were in that year separated from the Chengalpat Collectorate, and placed under the officer then called the 'Land Customer,' but subsequently appointed 'Collector of Madras.' In 1860, the town of Madras, the sea-customs excepted, was transferred to Chengalpat; but in 1870 the former arrangement was reverted to, and the Collectorate of Madras remains distinct from that of this District.\n\nPopulation.\u2014Several attempts have been made to enumerate the inhabitants. The first Census, taken in 1795\u201396, when the District was just beginning to recover from the Mysore devastations, gave a total population of 217,372, inhabiting 59,911 houses. The next, in 1850, showed 583,462 souls; in 1859, 603,221, living in 93,310 houses; in 1866, 804,283, in 123,605 dwellings. The enumeration of 1871 disclosed a population of 938,184 persons; and the last regular Census of the 17th February 1881 returned a total population of 981,381, living in 142,182 houses and 2003 villages, among which are included 6 towns. The increase of population in the decade 1871\u20131881 was 43,197, or 4\u00b76 per cent. Number of persons per square mile, 345, ranging from 598 in Said\u00e1pet to 269 in Chengalpat taluks. In point of density Chengalpat ranks sixth in the Presidency. Number of persons per house, 6\u00b79. The proportions of the sexes are nearly equal, the males numbering 492,626, the females 488,755, or 502 males to 498 females in every 1000. Classified according to religion there were 939,314 Hindus, Vaishnavs and Sivaites being in almost equal proportions; 25,034 Muhammadans, chiefly Sunnis; 16,774 Christians, of whom 81 per cent. were Roman Catholics; Jains and Buddhists, 229; and 'others,' 30. Among the Christians, Europeans numbered 1683, and Eurasians 1174, the remainder being natives. Under 10 years there were 273,928, and between 10 and 20 years 200,935. By caste, the Hindus were distributed as follows: Br\u00e1hmans, 32,026, or 3\u00b741 per cent. of the total population; Kshattriyas (warriors), 6435, or 0\u00b769 per cent.; Shetties (traders), 16,825, or 1\u00b779 per cent.; Vall\u00e1lars (agriculturists), 181,316, or 19\u00b731 per cent.; Idaiyars (shepherds), 55,271, or 5\u00b789 per cent.; Kamm\u00e1lars (artisans), 21,805, or 2\u00b733 per cent.; Kanakkan (writers), 15,059, or 1\u00b761 per cent.; Kaikalar (weavers), 35,662, or 3\u00b779 per cent.; Vanniyan (labourers), 190,876, or 20\u00b733 per cent.; Kushavan (potters), 7775, or 0\u00b782 per cent.; Sat\u00e1ni (mixed castes), 14,549, or 1\u00b755 per cent.; Shembadavan (fisher-\nmen), 16,027, or 1.71 per cent.; Sh\u00e1n\u00e1n (toddy-drawers), 18,290, or 1.94 per cent.; Ambattan (barbers), 9655, or 1.02 per cent.; Vann\u00e1n (washermen), 13,089, or 1.39 per cent.; Pariahs, 243,597, or 25.93 per cent.; 'others,' 61,057, or 6.49 per cent. Classified according to occupation, 1.70 per cent. of the total population, or 14,758 males and 1949 females, belong to the professional class; 0.57 per cent., or 2664 males and 2919 females, to the domestic; 1.08 per cent., or 9057 males and 1486 females, to the commercial; 30.60 per cent., or 224,028 males and 76,298 females, to the agricultural; 9.77 per cent., or 54,626 males and 41,226 females, to the industrial; and 56.28 per cent., or 187,493 males and 364,877 females (including children), to the indefinite and non-productive, 6.51 per cent. among the last being returned as 'occupied.' About 50.23 per cent. are returned as 'workers,' on whom the remaining 49.77 per cent. of the population depend. Of the males 67.13 per cent., and of the females 33.19 per cent. were 'workers.' There were educated or under instruction 101,096 persons, or 95,964 males and 5132 females; the percentage being 19.48 for the male and 1.05 for the female population. Pariahs are numerically the strongest caste; the Vanniyans come next; and after them the Vall\u00e1lars. These three castes are extensively influenced by European contact; for, though the great majority engage only in the agricultural and servile labour that tradition assigns them, many of them have pushed to the front, and they now fill one-third of the official posts within the reach of natives. Of those in 'the professions,' it is noteworthy that in this District, which lies near the capital, and is therefore under the influence of the British example of toleration and indifference to caste, there are as many Pariahs as Br\u00e1hmans. From the same cause, and from the progress of education, orthodox Hinduism shows signs of losing ground, and an advanced Monotheism is making way. There are, however, no Brahma Sam\u00e1j centres. The chief towns of the District are\u2014Conjeveram (population 37,275); St. Thomas' Mount, a military cantonment (15,013); Saidapet (10,290); Tiruvatityur (9098); Chengalpat (5617); Punamalli, cantonment (4821); Tiruvallur (6242); Pallavaram, cantonment (3956). Conjeveram is the only municipal town in the District. Besides these, there are 36 townships with from 2000 to 3000 inhabitants, making the total urban population about 20 per cent. of the whole. The villages with less than 500 inhabitants each, number 1443. The neighbourhood of the capital naturally exercises great influence on the surplus adult labour of the District, but this is nevertheless essentially agricultural. The people are much attached to their lands, and the literal interpretation given to mird\u00ed rights (vide infra) strengthens this attachment.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014The land nowhere attains the high fertility of some of\nthe other Madras Districts, and is, as a rule, poor. Where the underlying rock does not crop up, the soil is often either impregnated with soda or very sandy. Nor do the cultivators combat this natural poverty. The stubble is never left to enrich the ground; and animal manure, being required for fuel (owing to the absence of forests), is not applied to the extent that it should be. The absence of marsh land is a remarkable feature; but wet crops are largely raised beneath the banks of the numerous tanks which dot the District. Agriculture is nevertheless very backward, a fact attributable in part to the number of absentee landowners, who reside in Madras, and seldom, if ever, visit their properties. This leaves the land to be cultivated by rack-rented tenants (p\u0101ik\u0101ris), checks the investment of capital in the soil, and encourages a slovenly and hand-to-mouth system of agriculture. Perhaps no better indication of the poverty of the actual tillers of the soil can be given than that the land revenue is regularly in arrears, and that from 15 to 20 per cent. of the total has to be collected annually by coercive process. The prevalent tenure is r\u0101yatw\u0101r\u012b, the cultivator holding direct from Government, with a permanent right of occupancy. Of 728,904 acres of cultivable Government land available for such holdings, 539,862 acres are thus held under 71,881 separate deeds. Under this head are included 8212 'joint' holdings, a whole village being occasionally held by coparceners. The rest of the Government land in the District, 1,089,996 acres, is reserved for special purposes, as grazing grounds, village sites, etc., or is waste. About 250,000 acres of private property are under cultivation, raising the total of productive land in the District to about 800,000 acres. Most of this, though settled in r\u0101yatw\u0101r\u012b tenure, is subject to certain m\u012br\u0101s\u012b or hereditary rights, which take the form of a tax paid by outsiders to the descendants of the original villagers, for what is practically the permission to cultivate. Besides the r\u0101yatw\u0101r\u012b tenure, various other forms of holding obtain, the chief being zamind\u0101r\u012b, mitta, shrotri\u0101m, man\u0101yam, and ij\u0101r\u0101, all distinguished by a common system of rack-renting. About 25 per cent. of the villages of the District thus belong to landlords with privileged tenures, a large proportion of whom are absentees. Their agents almost invariably oppress the tenants, who occupy theoretically only 'at will,' and are frequently in debt to the landlord, his agent, or the village money-lender. Those who are not, are almost constantly waging war against their landlords in either the Revenue or the Civil Courts.\n\nThe soil is classified into four varieties\u2014'permanently improved,' regar or 'alluvial,' 'red ferruginous,' and 'arenaceous,' or sandy, the third being by far the most common. The proportion of 'wet' (artificially irrigated) cultivation to 'dry' is as 7 to 6. An acre of the former would be assessed at from 4s. to 15s., and its yield for each\ncrop may be estimated at about \u00a33, 4s. per acre; the net profit to the cultivator, after deducting land revenue, cesses, etc., and value of labour, the major portion of which in the case of the actual cultivator goes into his own pocket, averaging \u00a31, 9s. 6d. per acre, exclusive of the value of the straw, for each crop. In favourable situations, such as the neighbourhood of tanks and river channels, two crops are obtained in the year. On dry land, the assessment varies from 6d. to 4s. per acre, the average being a trifle over 3s.; the riyatwari holdings average 7\u00bd acres each. Deducting the land revenue and other expenses, the cultivator's net annual profit averages 13s. per acre, or on his total holding, \u00a34, 17s. 6d. The chief wet-land crop is rice of three kinds \u2014 samba, kar, and manakatai \u2014 divided by the cultivators into 31 varieties. On dry lands the staple crops are ragi, varagu, cholam, kambu, indigo, pulses, oil-seeds, ground-nuts, chillies, and tobacco.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014Many years have been marked by great scarcity, arising from various causes; but in five only did the scarcity amount to famine. In 1733, from neglect of irrigation; in 1780, from the ravages of the Mysore troops; in 1787, from drought; in 1785, from extraordinary floods, which destroyed the tanks and water channels; and in 1806\u20137, owing to a general failure of the rains throughout the Presidency, the District suffered from famine. In 1867\u201368, prices rose very high; and during the famine of 1876, the starvation point was nearly reached. When paddy or unhusked rice rises to 8 lbs. for the shilling, especially if that price is stationary for any length of time, measures of State relief become necessary. The District is peculiarly liable to cyclones, the months of May and October being the usual periods of visitation. Between 1746 and 1846, fifteen disastrous cyclones have been recorded, and 1872 was marked by the occurrence of a most destructive storm of this kind. The cyclones are generated in the Bay of Bengal, and approach the coast of the District (the town of Madras being frequently touched by their centres) from the south-south-east, afterwards assuming a west or west-south-westerly direction. The area within which their action is usually felt extends from 109 miles north to 120 miles south of Madras. They have from the earliest times caused great destruction to shipping, strewing the coasts with wrecks, breaching the tanks, sweeping away villages, and inflicting on the country most disastrous losses in cattle and other live stock. The rainfall accompanying a cyclone averages 6 inches.\n\nCommerce and Trade.\u2014The trade of the small coast towns has long ago been attracted to Madras; and, except at the Presidency town, there is now no commercial activity along the seaboard. Pulikat alone maintained its independence as a trading port until 1864; but in that year its customs house also was removed, and the coast of the District is now deserted. Land trade (except the local interchange of field\nproduce and the necessaries of life) exists only in the unremunerative form of through traffic; while such industries as the manufacture of spirits for local consumption, and the planting of *casuarina* groves, belong rather to the city of Madras than to Chengalpat District. The salt manufactured for Government gives employment to many thousand families, chiefly *mir\u00e1sid\u00e1rs* having hereditary rights to the manufacture; and the annual out-turn is valued at \u00a3526,142. Weaving occupies about 30,000 persons, but\u2014except the finer muslins of Arni, the art of making which is nearly extinct, and confined to only a few families, and the coloured cloths of Conjeveram\u2014none of the District manufactures have more than local repute. Metal-ware to a small extent, and indigo, the making of which is on the increase, complete the list of the non-agricultural industries. The fresh-water fisheries yield an annual revenue of about \u00a3114; but the sea fishery, though yielding no revenue, and not under any kind of official control, is a most important industry. The number of large boats employed is over 400. An extensive trade is carried on in fresh fish, brought into Madras from as great a distance as 20 miles, in baskets slung on a pole or on men's heads, and thence exported by rail to Bangalore and other places. The varieties most prized are the Indian mackerel (Scomber kanagurta), mango fish (Polynemus paradiseus), mullet, seer (Cybium), and pomfret (Stromateus). Turtles from Pulikat, and oysters from Sadr\u00e1s and Cove-long, supply the Madras market. There were, in 1881\u201382, 675 miles of road in the District, nearly all metalled or gravelled throughout, and 80 miles of coast canal. The South Indian Railway passes through the District in two directions, one the main line for 65 miles south, running from Madras past St. Thomas' Mount, Pall\u00e1varam, Chengalpat, and M\u00e1dhurantakam, and the other, which is a branch line from Chengalpat to Conjeveram and Arkonam on the Madras line, for 31 miles north-west. The Madras Railway also passes for 40 miles of its course through the Tiruvall\u00far and Said\u00e1pet *t\u00e1luks*.\n\n**Administration.**\u2014The District is divided for revenue purposes into 6 *t\u00e1luks*, namely, Chengalpat, Conjeveram, Madhurantakam, Ponneri, Saidapet, and Tiruvallur, each with its sub-divisional native establishment subordinate to the head-quarters at Saidapet, the revenue and magisterial jurisdictions being in every case conterminous. The sessions are held at Chengalpat, 30 miles from Saidapet, where also the sub-collector and civil surgeon are stationed. Within the limits of the District, but under independent jurisdiction, lies the Presidency town of Madras. The total revenue of the District was returned in 1881\u201382 at \u00a3566,287, and the total expenditure on civil administration at \u00a3143,122. The principal items of receipt were as follows:\u2014Land revenue, \u00a3177,396; salt, \u00a3347,911; excise on spirits and drugs, \u00a328,741; stamps, \u00a311,060; and licence tax, \u00a31179. Chief items of\nexpenditure:\u2014Land revenue and excise collection, \u00a314,260; and salt establishments, \u00a342,956. The police force aggregated, in 1881, a total strength of 17 officers and 930 men, maintained at a cost of \u00a315,183, or about 4d. per head of the population. Of this force, nearly one-half were jail and salt guards, the actual number of constables on general duty being 499, or one to every $5\\frac{2}{3}$ square miles and every 1967 inhabitants. There are 13 jails in the District, with an average daily population of 160 prisoners, and costing annually \u00a31439.\n\nEducation has recently made marked progress, and female education is spreading; 10 per cent. of the population can now read and write. The District being in close proximity to the Presidency town, the colleges and schools there, for the most part, provide higher education. The Saidapet High School, which teaches up to the College entrance examination, is the only purely Government educational institution now within the District. There are 4 aided schools, which also prepare for the matriculation examination. There were in 1881, 580 schools conducted on the results grants system, which were under the supervision of the Local Fund Board. The number of pupils was 11,824, and the sums paid as results grants was \u00a31388. The total cost to Government of education in the District in 1881-82 was \u00a32158, in addition to \u00a31388 paid by the Local Fund Board on account of grants to the schools mentioned above. Chengalpat contains only one municipality, Conjevaram, and 3 military cantonments\u2014St. Thomas' Mount, Pallavaram, and Punamalli.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate, considering the latitude, may be called temperate, and the extremes of heat and cold experienced inland are here unknown. Both monsoons affect the District. The mean temperature for the whole year, day and night, is about 81\u00b0 F., varying from 63\u00b0 to 107\u00b0. The annual rainfall averages 41 inches. This figure cannot be held to be absolutely accurate, but care having been of late years taken in gauging the rainfall, it is not very far from the truth. In 1846, 20 inches of rain fell in as many hours, and the whole District was flooded. Chengalpat has the reputation of being one of the healthiest Districts in the Presidency. The fevers which devastate so many other parts, are almost unknown in it. The annual death-rate, according to the mortuary returns, is 22 per thousand. Epidemic cholera has until recently been frequent, and, in 1875-76, caused in Conjevaram alone 1067 deaths out of 1577. Since then, however, there has been but little of this disease. Ague in the cold damp weather is not uncommon, and small-pox and ophthalmia are prevalent diseases. [For further information regarding Chengalpat, see the Manual of Chengalpat District, by C. S. Crole, Esq., C.S., Madras, 1879. Also the Madras Census Report for 1881; and the Annual Administration Reports of the Madras Government from 1880 to 1883.]\nChengalpat (Chingleput).\u2014Taluk of Chengalpat District, Madras Presidency. Area, 436 square miles; villages, 298; houses, 16,456; population (1881) 117,218, or 269 persons per square mile, and nearly 7 per house. Males, 59,049; females, 58,169. The soil is mostly ferruginous loam in the interior, and sandy towards the west. It is, generally speaking, rocky and poor, the country being covered with low hills and extensive scrub jungle. Its appearance is, however, generally more pleasing and variegated than that of the rest of the District. The taluk contained in 1883, 2 civil and 3 criminal courts, with 8 police circles (th\u00e1n\u00eds); strength of police force, 69 men.\n\nChengalpat (Chingleput, 'The brick town').\u2014Chief town of the taluk of Chengalpat, Chengalpat District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 12\u00b0 42' 1\" N., long. 80\u00b0 1' 13\" E.; population (1881) 5617, namely, 5286 Hindus, 235 Muhammadans, 95 Christians, and 1 unspecified. Situated at the junction of the Chengalpat-Arkonam branch with the main line of the South Indian Railway. As the seat of the District Sessions Judge, and the head-quarters of the sub-collector and civil surgeon and of the taluk, it contains the usual civil and criminal courts, as well as the court of the District munsif, jail, hospital, post-office, etc. There is a large chhatram or free halting-place for native travellers, built from local funds, and under the management of the Local Fund Board; also a public bungalow for the accommodation of Europeans. The Roman Catholic and Free Churches have established missions here.\n\nThe historic interest of Chengalpat centres in its fort, now partly traversed by the railway, and abandoned for all military purposes. It was erected about the end of the 16th century, when the Vijayanagar R\u00e1j\u00e1s, fallen from their original power, held their court alternately here and at Chandragiri. The workmanship proves it to be of Hindu origin, and the site selected must have rendered it impregnable in the past. On three sides lie a lake and swamps; the fourth, naturally weak, is strongly defended by a double line of fortifications. Although now commanded on all sides by modern artillery, it has always been considered one of the keys of the Presidency town. About 1644, the fort passed into the hands of the Golconda chiefs, by whom it was surrendered to the Naw\u00e1bs of Arcot, who in turn gave it up in 1751 to Ch\u00e1nda Sahib, when, assisted by the French, he invaded the Karnatic. In 1752, Clive bombarded it, compelling the French garrison to surrender; and throughout the campaign it continued of the first importance to the British\u2014now as a place of confinement for the French prisoners, now as a d\u00e9p\u00f4t for war material, and again as a centre for petty operations against the turbulent P\u00e1leg\u00e1rs of the surrounding country. After the reduction of Fort St. David, the Madras Government, apprehensive of an attack on Madras, called in all the\ngarrisons and stores from outlying forts; and the stronghold of Chengalpat was thus actually abandoned in 1758. Considerations of its importance soon, however, persuaded our Government to re-occupy it, and while the French were advancing from the south, a strong garrison was thrown into it from Madras. Lally, the French General, arrived just too late, and, finding it impregnable except by regular siege, made the mistake of leaving it in his rear, and passed on to Madras. During the siege that followed, the garrison of Chengalpat rendered invaluable assistance, not only by securing the country north of the P\u00e1l\u00e1r, but by sallying out with disastrous effect upon the rear of the investing enemy. In 1780, the British force, after the destruction of General Baillie's column, found refuge here; and during the wars with Mysore, this fortress was once taken by the enemy, re-occupied by the British, and twice unsuccessfully besieged. It was from the P\u00e1leg\u00e1r or Nayakkan of Chengalpat and Chandragiri that the British originally obtained permission, in 1639, to build the town of Madras.\n\n**Chengama (Tingrecotta or Singaricotta).**\u2014A pass connecting the Districts of Salem and South Arcot, Madras Presidency. Lat. $12\u00b0\\ 21'$ to $12\u00b0\\ 23'\\ 45''$ N.; long. $78\u00b0\\ 50'$ to $78\u00b0\\ 52'\\ 35''$ E. As the direct route to the B\u00e1ramah\u00e1l from the Karnatic, it has been the scene of several important events. In 1760, Makd\u00fam Ali entered the Karnatic by this pass; and here, in 1767, Haidar Al\u00ed, pursuing the British in their retreat on Trinomalai, received a severe defeat. Two years later, the Mysore army retreated by the Chengama, and in 1780 returned through it to destroy General Baillie's column. In 1791, Tip\u00fa led off his forces\u2014the last army that invaded the British Karnatic\u2014by the same route.\n\n**Chennagiri.**\u2014Tiluk and village in Shimoga District, Mysore State. \u2014See Channagiri.\n\n**Chepauk.**\u2014A quarter of Madras Town.\n\n**Chera** (or Kerala).\u2014Name of one of the oldest kingdoms in Southern India. Its exact locality is still a subject of dispute, but it is quite certain that it lay on the western coast. It is doubtful whether it was simply synonymous with Kerala, which was the name of the whole western coast, including Travancore, or whether it was an older name for the kingdoms of Kerala and of the Korigu kings combined. If the latter, it embraced, besides the present Districts of K\u00e1nara and Malab\u00e1r and the Native States of Cochin and Travancore, the Districts of Coimbatore and Salem, with parts of Mysore and the Nilgiris. In the oldest historical days, Chera, Chola, and P\u00e1ndya formed the three great southern kingdoms, the confines of which met, according to tradition, at a place on the K\u00e1veri (Cauvery) river, 11 miles east of Kar\u00far. Probably the larger country was at different periods broken up into two divisions, the coast and the inland, which again united under the old\nname, provincialisms in language giving rise to various pronunciations. The date of the origin of the Chera dynasty is unknown, but it was in existence early in the Christian era. Towards the end of the ninth, or beginning of the tenth century, the Chera country was overrun by the Cholas. To the Chola dynasty succeeded, after an interval of anarchy, the rule of the Hoys\u00e1la Ball\u00e1l\u00e1s of Mysore, who held the country till they were overthrown by the Muhammadans in A.D. 1310. The latter were shortly afterwards driven out by a Hindu confederation, headed by the rising chiefs of Vijayanagar, and for two centuries were held in check, while the Vijayanagar empire, which absorbed the ancient State of Chera, grew to its greatest height of prosperity and grandeur. In 1565, the Vijayanagar kingdom was destroyed by the Muhammadans; but the Chera country was firmly held by the Nayakkas of Madura, till the period when the whole of southern India was decimated by the constant strife between the rising kings of Mysore, the Madura Nayakkas, and the Muhammadans. In 1640, the Chera country was captured by the armies of the Adil Shahi dynasty of Bijaypur, and was seized by the Mysore king in 1652. Perpetual strife ensued, ending only on the downfall of Tip\u00fa Sultan and the capture of Seringapatam.\n\n\u2014See also Chola.\n\nCher\u00e1nd.\u2014Village in S\u00e1ran District, Bengal; situated on the main stream of the Ganges, 7 miles east of Chapr\u00e1, in lat. $25^\\circ 43' 41''$ N., long. $84^\\circ 52' 10''$ E. Contains the remains of an old fort, the history of which is unknown, and a ruined mosque.\n\nCher\u00e1t.\u2014Hill cantonment and sanitarium in Nawashahra tal\u00eds\u00edl, Pesh\u00e1war District, Punjab; lies in lat. $33^\\circ 50' 0''$ N., and long. $72^\\circ 1' 0''$ E., at an elevation of 4500 feet above sea-level, on the west of the Khattak range, which divides the Districts of Pesh\u00e1war and Koh\u00e1t; distant from Pesh\u00e1war 34 miles south-east, from Nawashahra 25 miles south-west. The site was first brought to notice in 1853 by Major Coke, who observed it during the exploration of the Mir Kal\u00e1n route to Koh\u00e1t; but some years passed before active steps were taken for its occupation, owing to the fear of political complications with the surrounding Afr\u00eddi tribes. In 1861, a temporary camp, established during the autumn months, proved a complete success; and since that time, troops have been annually moved up with great benefit to their health. Even in the hottest seasons, the temperature seldom exceeds $80^\\circ$ F. The water-supply comes from a spring at Sap\u00e1ri, nearly 3 miles distant; estimated outflow, 20,000 gallons per diem in the driest season of the year. There is another spring, very much nearer the station, the water of which is slightly sulphurous; it is used for bathing. Towards the end of June, the temperature in the shade rises as high as $96^\\circ$, but once the rain falls, the climate becomes very pleasant. The hill is rocky, but is not void of vegetation; the wild olive (kabu), dodonia, and\nother wild bushes grow in abundance, and in the spring there is an abundance of wild flowers. The place is still called a camp, no regular cantonments having yet (1883) been laid out, and the men till recently lived in tents. Huts, however, have now been built for the better accommodation of the detachments. The land belongs to the Uri\u00e1 Khel Khattaks of the three villages of Sh\u00e1kot, Sil\u00e1kh\u00e1na, and Bhaktipur. When the troops are away in the winter, the people of these villages receive \u00a320 a month for taking care of the Government property left. There is a small Roman Catholic Chapel, but no Protestant Church, although the chaplain of Pesh\u00e1war makes occasional visits. The hill commands a view of the whole of the Pesh\u00e1war valley on one side, and on the other of a great part of R\u00e1wal Pindi and of the Khw\u00e1ra valley in Koh\u00e1t District.\n\n**Cherpulchari** (*Cherupullaseri*).\u2014Town in Malab\u00e1r District, Madras Presidency; situated 10 miles from the Pat\u00e1mbi railway station, in lat. 10\u00b0 53' N., long. 76\u00b0 22' 20\" E. Houses, 714; population (1881) 4501, namely, 3668 Hindus, 829 Muhammadans, and 4 Christians. Formerly (1792\u20131800) the station of the Southern Superintendent under Bombay, and (1860) the head-quarters of the Nedungan\u00e1d t\u00e1lik. Contains a sub-magisterial establishment, post-office, travellers' bungalow, etc. It was annexed to Mysore in 1766, and was the scene of troubles with the Zamorin's family in 1790.\n\n**Cherra** (Kh\u00e1si, Soh-rah).\u2014Petty State in the Kh\u00e1si Hills, Assam. Population (1881) 8055; revenue, \u00a3855, chiefly from market dues. The presiding chief, whose title is Siem, is named U H\u00e1jan M\u00e1nik. The principal products of the State are\u2014oranges, betel-nuts, honey, bamboos, lime, and coal. Manufacture of bamboo mats and baskets. The Kh\u00e1si word of Soh-rah, from which the little State and its capital derive their name, is the name of an edible fruit-tree.\n\n**Cherra Punji** (Khasi, Soh-r\u00e1h-pungi).\u2014The principal village of Cherra State, Kh\u00e1si Hills, Assam; a name now also given by custom to an abandoned British station in the Kh\u00e1si Hills District, about 30 miles south of Shillong, and 4588 feet above sea-level. Lat. 25\u00b0 16' 58\" N., long. 91\u00b0 46' 42\" E.; population (1881) 2729. Cherra Punji was early chosen as the residence of the chief British official in the Kh\u00e1si Hills. The administrative head-quarters of the District were removed to Shillong in 1864, and Cherra Punji was abandoned. The station, which lies to the south of the punji or village, which forms the residence of the chief of the State, is now, save for a d\u00e1k bungalow, police-station, and post-office, entirely deserted; and the remains of the solidly-built houses, now mere roofless walls choked with jungle, form a melancholy spectacle. North of the plateau on which the station stood, and south of the village, is the Christian colony of Nong-Saulia, which forms the centre of operations of the Welsh Calvinistic Mission.\nThis mission first established itself in the hills in 1841, and has done much to spread both education and Christianity among the Kh\u00e1sis. The management of education in the District is chiefly in the hands of the missionaries, but there is one Government school at Shillong. The normal school at Cherra Punji, under the control of the Rev. Hugh Roberts and his wife, was attended in 1881-82 by 40 Kh\u00e1si pupils, of whom 9 were girls. The total cost was \u00a3404, almost entirely paid by Government. Soh-rah-rin, or old Sohrah or Cherra, a former capital of the State, is situated 7 miles north of the present village, at which there is a rest-house on the Assam and Sylhet road, where a weekly market is held. Coal is found over an area estimated at one-third of a square mile, with an average thickness of from 3 feet 6 inches to 4 feet; the possible output is calculated at 447,000 tons. The mineral is of excellent quality, being little inferior to ordinary English coal; but it has never yet been profitably worked. The British Government holds a perpetual lease of the coal strata from the native chief or siem, on payment of a royalty. Between 1844 and 1859, sub-leases were granted to a succession of British capitalists, and during two years of that period the mine was regularly worked; but since 1859, this mine, like most of the others in the Kh\u00e1si Hills, has remained untouched. Potatoes are largely cultivated. Cherra Punji enjoys the reputation of having the heaviest known rainfall in the world. The registered fall during the five years ending 1881 shows an annual average of 462\u00b785 inches. It is reported that a total of 805 inches fell in 1861, of which 366 inches are assigned to the single month of July. This excessive rainfall is caused by the circumstance that Cherra Punji stands on the first of a series of hill ranges that rise abruptly from the plain of Bengal, and catch the vapour of all the clouds that roll up from the sea.\n\n**Cherupullaseri.**\u2014Town in Malab\u00e1r District, Madras Presidency.\u2014See Cherpulchari.\n\n**Chetpat (Ch\u00e9tupatu).**\u2014Quarter of Madras Town.\n\n**Chetterpur.**\u2014Town in Ganj\u00e1m District, Madras Presidency.\u2014See Chatrapur.\n\n**Chetv\u00e1i.**\u2014Village in Malab\u00e1r District, Madras Presidency, and part of the township of V\u00e1danapalli, which contains 1372 houses, and in 1871, 8018 inhabitants. No later statistics are available, as the town is not returned separately in the Madras Census Report of 1881. Lat. 10\u00b0 32' N.; long. 76\u00b0 5' E. Formerly a place of some importance, as being a terminus of the vast inland backwater communications of Cochin and Travancore. In 1717, the Dutch wrested it from the Zamorin, built a fort, and made it the capital of their Province of P\u00e1ppinivattam. In 1776, Haidar Al\u00ed overran the District, and captured the fort. In 1790, the place passed into British possession, and was leased to the Cochin R\u00e1j\u00e1 until 1805, in which\nyear it came under the direct administration of the East India Company.\n\n**Cheyair (Ch\u00e9y\u00e9r\u016b).**\u2014River in Cuddapah District, Madras Presidency; a tributary of the Pennar. Flows for some miles through the Seshachellam hills, and is crossed by the railway near Nandalur, the scene of a terrible disaster in 1870. Owing to its steep and precipitous course, the utilization of its waters for irrigation is almost impossible.\n\n**Cheyair (Ch\u00e9y\u00e9r\u016b Bahunad\u012b).**\u2014River in North Arcot District, Madras Presidency; rises in the Jawadi range (lat. 12\u00b0 30' N., long. 78\u00b0 50' E.), and after a course north-east of about 90 miles, during which it flows past Trivat\u016br and feeds many irrigational works, it joins the Palar in Chengalpat District, in lat. 12\u00b0 42' N., long. 79\u00b0 55' E.\n\n**Chhachrauli.**\u2014Chief town of Chhachrauli tahsil, Kalsia State, Punjab. Population (1881) 5389, namely, Hindus, 3447; Muhammadans, 1699; Sikhs, 208; Jains, 35. Number of occupied houses, 756.\n\n**Chhagan Gobra.**\u2014Village in Athgarh State, Orissa. Lat. 20\u00b0 34' 0\" N.; long. 85\u00b0 51' 5\" E. Inhabited exclusively by a small community of native Christians, under the charge of the Baptist Mission at Cuttack. The village has a small chapel, and is prettily situated on a slight eminence, surrounded by well-cultivated rice-fields. Two other Christian hamlets adjoin it.\n\n**Chh\u00e1l\u00e1p\u00e1k.**\u2014Dep\u00f4t in Rangpur District, Bengal. Trade in jute and lime.\n\n**Chh\u00e1liar.**\u2014Petty State of Rew\u00e1 K\u00e1ntha, Gujar\u00e1t, Bombay Presidency. Area, 11 square miles, containing 24 villages; estimated revenue, \u00a31200, of which \u00a3340 is paid as tribute to the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda. The Choh\u00e1ns established themselves here at a very early period. The original limits of the State embraced Vakhtapur and R\u00e1jpur, which were subsequently assigned to cadets of the family.\n\n**Chh\u00e1lla.**\u2014Petty State of Jh\u00e1l\u00e1w\u00e1r in K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay Presidency; consisting of 1 village, with 2 independent tribute-payers. Estimated revenue in 1876, \u00a3230; tribute of \u00a397 is paid to the British Government, and \u00a37, 16s. to Jun\u00e1garh.\n\n**Chhanchi\u00e1 M\u00edrganj.**\u2014Dep\u00f4t in Rangpur District, Bengal. Trade in rice and jute.\n\n**Chhanuy\u00e1 (or Chan\u00faa).**\u2014Port on the P\u00e1nchp\u00e1r\u00e1 river, Balasor District, Orissa. Lat. 21\u00b0 32' 30\" N.; long. 87\u00b0 6' 21\" E. Frequented by native sloops for cargoes of rice. The Sar\u00e1tha river joins the P\u00e1nchp\u00e1r\u00e1 a short distance above the point where the united stream falls into the Bay of Bengal. The entrance from the sea is impeded by a bar, covered at low tide with only a few inches of water. With\nthe rise of the tides, vessels of about 100 tons burthen contrive to get in. Above the bar there is no want of water, and the river is navigable by sea-going craft as far as Mah\u00e1d\u00e1n\u00ed, 9 miles from the sea in a direct line. The exports consist almost entirely of rice; there are no imports.\n\n**Chhap\u00e1ra.**\u2014Decayed town in Lakhn\u00e1dor tahsil, Scon\u00ed District, Central Provinces, situated 22 miles north of Scon\u00ed town, on the Jabalpur road. Population (1881) 2881, namely, Hindus, 2063; Muhammadans, 644; Jains, 161; aboriginals, 13. Formerly a considerable place, but sacked in the last century by the Pind\u00e1ris, from which it has never recovered. Excellent camping ground in the neighbourhood; travellers\u2019 bungalow.\n\n**Chh\u00e1ta.**\u2014Tahsil and town in Muttra District, North-Western Provinces.\u2014See Chata.\n\n**Chh\u00e1tak.**\u2014Village on the left bank of the Surm\u00e1 river, in Sylhet District, Assam; 32 miles below Sylhet town. Lat. 25\u00b0 2' 10\" N.; long. 91\u00b0 42' 20\" E. Up to this point, the Surm\u00e1 is navigable by steamers all the year round; and Chh\u00e1tak is a thriving seat of river traffic, where the limestone, oranges, and potatoes of the Kh\u00e1s\u00ed Hills are collected for shipment to Bengal. The articles received in exchange comprise cotton goods, salt, sugar, rice, pulses, and hardware. In 1881-82, the exports from Chh\u00e1tak by native boats were valued at \u00a314,000. The steamer traffic is chiefly a transit one to or from Cachar, Sylhet, and Shillong. The th\u00e1n\u00e1 or police circle of Chh\u00e1tak has a population (1881) of 81,466.\n\n**Chhatarpur.**\u2014Native State in Bundelkhand, under the Central India Agency and the Government of India. It lies to the south of Ham\u00edrpur District, bordered by the Dh\u00e1san and Ken rivers, between 24\u00b0 21' and 25\u00b0 16' N. lat., and between 79\u00b0 37' and 80\u00b0 28' E. long.; area, 1169 square miles; revenue, about \u00a325,000. Population (1881) 164,376, namely, 158,108 Hindus, 5510 Muhammadans, 749 Jains, and 9 Christians; number of villages, 315; number of occupied houses, 27,603; average density of population, 143\u00b741 persons per square mile. The founder of the present line of chiefs was an adventurer, who had dispossessed the descendant of Chhatar S\u00e1l in the days of Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 disturbances. On the British occupation of the Province in 1804, his submission was secured by the guarantee of his possessions. He received sanads to that effect in 1806 and 1808; and it is under these charters, and one of like import in 1817, that the estate is held. The chief received the title of R\u00e1j\u00e1 in 1827. The present ruler is R\u00e1j\u00e1 Bishen N\u00e1th Singh, a Pu\u00e1r R\u00e1jput by caste, who was born in 1867. During his minority, Chaubi Chubi Dhanpat R\u00e1i, a Deputy Collector in the North-Western Provinces, was appointed to superintend the State. He died in 1876. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 keeps up a military force of 62 horse and\n1178 infantry and police, with 32 guns and 38 gunners. He receives a salute of 11 guns.\n\n**Chhatarpur.**\u2014Chief town of the State of the same name, Bundelkhand, Central India Agency; situated in lat. 24\u00b0 54' N., long. 79\u00b0 38' E., on the route from Banda to Sagar (Saugor), 70 miles southwest of the former and 100 miles north-east of the latter. Population (1881) 13,474, namely, 11,154 Hindus, 1966 Muhammadans, and 354 'others.' It is a thriving place, having manufactures of paper and coarse cutlery made from iron mined from the adjacent hills. The most striking architectural objects are the ruins of the extensive palace of Chhatar Sal, the founder of the short-lived independence of Bundelkhand, in whose honour the town received its name. Close by is his mausoleum, a large structure of massive proportions and elaborate workmanship, surrounded by five domes. Most of the houses in the town are low, and the streets narrow, but a few of the residences of the more wealthy inhabitants are spacious and well built.\n\n**Chhatisgarh** ('The thirty-six forts').\u2014The south-eastern Division or Commissionership of the Central Provinces, lying between 20\u00b0 1' 0\" and 22\u00b0 33' 30\" N. lat., and between 80\u00b0 28' 0\" and 84\u00b0 24' 0\" E. long. Comprises the Districts of Raipur, with the four attached States of Chhuiakadan, Kanker, Khairagarh, and Nandgaon; Bilaspur, with the two attached States of Kawardha and Sakti; and Sambalpur, with the seven attached States of Kalahandi, Rairagarh, Sarangarh, Patna, Sonpur, Rairakhola, and Bamra. Total area, including feudatory States, 39,761 square miles; population (1881) 4,612,705. The area of the British Districts was 24,204 square miles; number of towns and villages, 11,724; number of houses, 918,986, of which 888,590 were occupied, and 30,396 unoccupied; population 3,115,997, namely, males 1,546,837, and females 1,569,160; average density of population, 128\u00b77 persons per square mile; villages per square mile, 48; houses per square mile, 37; persons per village, 266; persons per occupied house, 3\u00b751. Classified according to religion, the population of the British Districts consisted of\u2014Hindus, 2,118,898; Kabirpanthis, 240,646; Satnamis, 356,745; Kumbhipathias, 692; Sikhs, 10; Jains, 530; Muhammadans, 27,582; Christians, 966; aborigines, 369,928. Ethnically, however, the aboriginal tribes are returned at 770,773, the difference representing the number who have embraced some form of Hinduism. An account of a remarkable religious movement which has of late years sprung up among the Chamars of Chhatisgarh, will be found in the article on the Central Provinces.\n\nThe following brief description of the Chhatisgarh Division is quoted from *The Central Provinces Gazetteer*, Introduction, pp. xxiv., xxv. (second edition, Nagpur, 1870):\u2014'The Nagpur plain is terminated on\nthe east by a rocky barrier which divides it from the low-lying plateau known as Chhat\u00edsgarh, or \"the thirty-six forts.\" Land-locked on every side by deep forests or hill passes, and remote from all centres, whether of eastern or more modern western civilisation, this little principality was, till of comparatively late years, the least known portion of the obscurest division of India. Its central portion is an open plain, now so fertile that it is known to the bands of Banj\u00e1r\u00e1s, who annually come with their long trains of pack-bullocks to carry off its surplus produce, as the Khala\u00fati, or the \"Land of the Threshing-floors.\" But this agricultural wealth is new. The marks of human settlement have not hitherto gone beyond the bare necessities of agricultural life, and the great central plain of Chhat\u00edsgarh is to the eye most uninviting. Nature has provided a wide extent of fertile soil, and settlers have within the last quarter of a century multiplied and prospered. Great consignments of grain are sent out annually to feed the cotton-growing population of the Wardh\u00e1 valley, and to the country round Jabalpur, and the lower valley of the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed. Since the foregoing was written, Chhat\u00edsgarh has made great strides in material prosperity; new colonies of settlers have been introduced; exports have rapidly increased; and the construction of a line of railway will, in a few years, afford an additional impetus to commerce, by placing it in direct communication with the ports of Bombay on the west, and Calcutta on the east coast of India.\n\n**Chhatn\u00e1i.**\u2014Town in Rangpur District, Bengal. Population (1881) 9501, namely, 7458 Muhammadans and 2043 Hindus; area of town site, 9816 acres.\n\n**Chhibr\u00e1mau.**\u2014Tahsil of Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d District, North-Western Provinces, consisting of parg\u00e1ns Chhibr\u00e1mau and T\u00e1lgr\u00e1m. Area, 243 square miles, of which 166 are cultivated; population (1881) 122,782; land revenue, \u00a320,080; total Government revenue, \u00a323,223; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a335,547.\n\n**Chhibr\u00e1mau.**\u2014Town in Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d District, North-Western Provinces, and head-quarters of Chhibr\u00e1mau tahsil, situated on the Grand Trunk road, 17 miles south-south-west of Fatehgarh town. Population (1881) 7990, namely, Hindus, 6376; Muhammadans, 1596; Jains, 9; Christians, 9; area of town site, 137 acres. The town itself consists of two portions\u2014Chhibr\u00e1mau proper and Muhammadganj. The former is a quiet little country place of mud-built houses, standing just off the Grand Trunk road, and inhabited chiefly by Hindus. Muhammadganj to the west, originally a large village of mud houses, has profited greatly by the making of the Trunk road; and a well-built busy street now extends for about a quarter of a mile on either side of the highway. A handsome sarai or native inn, built by the Rohill\u00e1 Naw\u00e1b Muhammad Kh\u00e1n in the\nearly part of the last century, and restored by a British Collector, is the principal building. The other buildings are the official, civil, and revenue court-houses, police station, good school, and imperial post-office. A municipal revenue for police and conservancy purposes is levied by means of a house-tax, under the provisions of Act xx. of 1856. Good halting-place and encamping ground for travellers and troops.\n\n**Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1.** \u2014 District in the Narbad\u00e1 Division of the Chief-Commissionership of the Central Provinces, lying between $21^\\circ 20'$ and $22^\\circ 50'$ N. lat., and between $78^\\circ 14'$ and $79^\\circ 23'$ E. long. Bounded on the north and north-west by Narsinghpur and Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d; on the west by Bet\u00fal; on the east by Seoni; and on the south by N\u00e1gpur, while its south-western corner touches Berar. Area, after latest changes (1883), 3915 square miles; population (1881) 372,899. The administrative head-quarters of the District are at Chhindw\u00e1ra, which is also the principal town.\n\n**Physical Aspects.**\u2014Chhindw\u00e1ra naturally divides itself into a highland and a lowland region, the former of which, under the name of the B\u00e1lagh\u00e1t, occupies the greater part of the District. The B\u00e1lagh\u00e1t consists of a section of the S\u00e1tpura range, extending northward to the outer line of hills south of the Narbad\u00e1 (Nerbudda) valley. It rests for the most part upon the great basaltic formation, which stretches up from the south-west across the S\u00e1tpura Hills, as far east as Jabalpur (Jubbulpore). The highest of these ranges starts from the confines of the Har\u00e1i j\u00e1gir, and continues westward across the District, with a mean breadth of 8 miles, the ascents being steep on the north, but much easier on the other side. A beautiful valley skirts the southern base, and is again divided by an ill-defined range of hills from the central plateau, through which lies the descent to the plain of N\u00e1gpur. The average height of the B\u00e1lagh\u00e1t is 2000 feet above sea-level. The Zergh\u00e1t, or lowland region, comprises three pargan\u00e1s in the south-west angle of the District, touching upon N\u00e1gpur and Ber\u00e1r; and extends in an open and undulating country. In some parts of the uplands, the scene for miles is bare of trees; but the southern slopes of the S\u00e1tpuras are well wooded. Teak and s\u00e1j, the latter often of considerable size, are plentiful in these forests, besides the ordinary woods, which are largely exported to the neighbouring District of N\u00e1gpur. The total area of Government reserved forests in 1880\u201381 was 736 square miles. Along the streams which intersect the country, of which the Kanh\u00e1n is the most considerable, lie strips and patches of jungle, while the villages are often surrounded with groves of mango and tamarind trees. At Anoni, near Mah\u00faljhir, on the east of the Mah\u00e1deo Hills, a spring of hot water gushes from the ground. Trap covers the greater part of the District, resting in the south directly on the plutonic rocks, and in\nthe north on sandstone. It encloses an alluvial deposit, which at But\u00e1ri\u00e1 to the east, and at Misl\u00e1nw\u00e1r\u00e1 to the south of Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1, and at other places, yields remains of the Eocene period. The soil is generally black where it overlies the trap, and red where it rests on sandstone or plutonic rocks. The only important mineral product of Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 is coal. The coal-field at Barkoi, the oldest known in the District, has been experimentally worked for some years; but the high cost of carriage has prevented success. It contains two seams, of which the upper one alone has been explored. This will yield over 5 feet of coal, with heating qualities equal to two-thirds of the best Welsh coal. Four miles west of Sirgor\u00ed, a fine seam occurs in the bed of the Pench river; but whether it extends to the north, beneath the trap in the river, has not yet been ascertained. Coal has been found in many other parts of the District; but the places above named appear the most likely to prove suitable for mining purposes. Wild beasts formerly abounded in Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1, but the persistent efforts of shik\u00e1ris, who are very numerous in this District, have greatly diminished their numbers of late years. The tiger, the panther, and the bear occasionally prove destructive to human life, while the hunting cheetah, the wild dog, and the wolf are also met with. The crops suffer from the ravages of the wild boar, and of many kinds of deer. The numerous foxes and jackals keep down the small game in this District; but there are hares, partridges, and quails for the sportsman. In the cold season, snipe, wild-fowl, and kulang visit Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1, but the localities in which they are found are very few. In the j\u00e1gir estates in the S\u00e1tpura Hills, the bison may also be found.\n\nHistory.\u2014The midland Gond kingdom of Deogarh had its capital in this District. Its founder, J\u00e1tb\u00e1, subverted the ancient Gauli power above the gh\u00e1ts; and his descendants continued to rule until the advent of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. None of them, however, made any name in history before Bakht Buland, who visited Delhi, and purchased the protection of Aurangzeb by his timely conversion to the Muhammadan faith. This prince showed energy, both within and without his kingdom. He carried his arms southward beyond N\u00e1gpur, and made acquisitions from Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 and from Mandl\u00e1; while he invited settlers, both Muhammadan and Hindu, from all quarters into the country which he governed. The next R\u00e1j\u00e1, Ch\u00e1nd Sult\u00e1n, resided principally at N\u00e1gpur. On his death, the struggles which arose from a contested succession were finally composed by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s; and by the middle of the 18th century, the sovereignty of the Gond R\u00e1j\u00e1s became virtually extinct. The mountainous parts of the District have long been occupied by petty Gond or K\u00fark\u00fa chiefs, who owned a feudal subjection, first to the Gond R\u00e1j\u00e1s, and afterwards to the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s; and although the Gonds welcomed and supported Ap\u00e1 S\u00e1hib in his\nopposition to the English in 1819, the British Government has continued the policy of allowing the petty R\u00e1j\u00e1s to retain their lands and rights as tributaries. On the death of Raghuji III., the whole District finally lapsed to the British Empire in 1854. Since then, in 1865, the j\u00e1gir of Bariam-Pag\u00e1ra, and part of Pachmarhi, in the Mah\u00e1deo Hills, with the magnificent forests of Bor\u00ed and Denw\u00e1, have been transferred to Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d District.\n\n**Population.**\u2014The population of Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 District in 1872, after allowing for subsequent transfers, was returned by the Census at 316,228. At the last enumeration in 1881, the Census disclosed a total population of 372,899, or an increase of 56,671 (17.92 per cent.) in the nine years; this large increase, however, is in part nominal, being attributable to better enumeration in the zam\u00edn\u00e9d\u00eds. The details of the Census of 1881 are as follows:\u2014Total population, 372,899, namely, males 186,168, and females 186,731, spread over an area of 3915 square miles, and living in 1833 villages and towns; number of occupied houses, 73,621; average density of population, 95 persons per square mile; villages per square mile, 0.47; houses per square mile, 18.8; persons per house, 5.07. Classified according to religion, the population consisted of\u2014Hindus, 209,286; Kab\u00edrpanth\u00eds, 5528; Satn\u00e1m\u00eds, 6; Muhammadans, 11,298; Christians, 77; Jains, 1451; and tribes professing aboriginal religions, 145,253. The aboriginal tribes, including 7246 who have embraced other forms of religion, number 152,509 in all. Of these, 140,739 are Dravidian Gonds, and 10,561 of the Kolarian tribe of K\u00fark\u00fas. Among Hindus, the Br\u00e1hmans number 6765, and R\u00e1jputs 7574; the inferior Hindu castes above 5000 in number being\u2014Ahir, the most numerous caste in the District, herdsmen, etc., 27,378; K\u00farm\u00ed, the principal cultivating caste, 24,078; Mehr\u00e1, weavers, and village watchmen, 23,616; Bhoer, an industrious class of cultivators remarkable for their skill in irrigation, 12,691; Tel\u00ed, oil-pressers, and traders, 12,210; Lodh\u00eds, landholders, and cultivators, 8456; Kati\u00e1, weavers, 6963; Mal\u00ed, gardeners, 6625; and Kal\u00e1r, or spirit sellers, 5656. Of the two great Muhammadan sects, 11,154 are returned as Sunn\u00eds, and 134 as Shi\u00e1s. Regarding the occupations of the people, the Census Report classifies the male population into the following six main divisions:\u2014(1) Professional class, including Government officials, 3951; (2) domestic servants, etc., 613; (3) commercial class, including merchants, traders, carriers, etc., 1843; (4) agricultural and pastoral class, including gardeners, 92,559; (5) manufacturing, artisan, and other industrial classes, 19,579; (6) indefinite and non-productive (comprising 1925 labourers and 65,698 unspecified, including children), 67,623. There are only 3 towns in Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 District with a population exceeding 5000\u2014viz. Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1, the District head-quarters (population, 8220), Pand-\nHurna (7469), and Mohgaon (5180). Villages with from 1000 to 5000 inhabitants, 30; with from 200 to 1000, 506; with fewer than 200 inhabitants, 1294. The only municipalities are\u2014Chhindwara, Lodhikhera, Mohgaon, Pandhurna, and Saosar, with a total population of 29,792\u2014leaving 343,107 as forming the strictly rural population. The total municipal income raised in the District in 1880-81 was \u00a31519, of which \u00a31257 was derived from taxation, or an average of 1s. 2d. per head of the municipal population. The dialect generally prevailing in the Balaghat or highland part of the District is a mixture of Hindi and Marathi; but the Gonds and Kurkus use languages of their own.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Of the total area of 3915 square miles, only 1304 were cultivated in 1881; and of the portion lying waste, 999 are returned as cultivable; 8115 acres are irrigated, entirely by private enterprise. The area under the principal crops in 1881-82 is returned as follow:\u2014Rice, 11,317 acres; wheat, 95,429; other food-grains, 557,594; oil-seeds, 91,892; sugar-cane, 7598; cotton, 45,408; fibres, 406; tobacco, 767; vegetable, 1977. This acreage includes lands growing two crops in the year. Cotton cultivation continues steadily to increase. Potatoes were introduced in the beginning of the present century, and supply a food much appreciated by the natives. They are grown principally in the vicinity of Chhindwara, and the greater part of the produce is exported to Kampthi (Kamptee). There are two great harvests in the year\u2014the kharif, gathered between September and February, and the rabi, from February to the close of May. The crops depend entirely upon the seasons, except in the Pandhurna pargana below the ghats, where water lies near the surface. Manure is always used in the plains, but as a rule the crops above the ghats are not manured. Irrigation is practised for sugar-cane and garden crops, and sometimes also for wheat. A system of rotation of crops is observed, in which the cultivators show considerable skill. The agricultural stock of the District is returned as follows:\u2014Cows, bullocks, and buffaloes, 240,287; horses, 176; ponies, 8912; donkeys, 981; sheep and goats, 31,822; pigs, 9819; ploughs, 51,235. The rates of rent per acre for the different qualities of land are returned as follows:\u2014Land suitable for rice, 2s.; wheat, 3s. 6d.; inferior grains, 2s. 6d.; cotton, 1s. 7d.; oil-seeds, 9d.; sugar-cane, 3s. Average produce per acre in lbs.:\u2014Rice, 360; wheat, 400; inferior grains, 409; cotton, 60; raw sugar (gur), 400. Average price of produce per cwt.:\u2014Rice, 6s. 10d.; wheat, 4s. 5d.; cotton, \u00a32, 14s.; sugar, 13s. 8d. The Census of 1881 showed a total of 6071 landed proprietors; the tenants numbered 111,005, of whom 15,347 had either absolute or occupancy rights, while 69,719 were tenants-at-will or with unspecified status, and 24,660 were employed in home cultivation. The average\narea cultivated in 1881 by each head of the regular agricultural population (170,407, or 45.70 per cent. of the District population) was 9 acres; the amount of Government revenue and local cesses levied from the landholders was \u00a323,651; and the amount of rental, including cesses, paid by the cultivators, was \u00a338,674, or an average of 1s. 2\u00bdd. per cultivated acre. The condition of the peasantry is fairly prosperous, and, except in the town of Mohg\u00e1ou, there are very few beggars. The rate of wages per diem for skilled labour varies from 1s. to 2s.; for unskilled labour from 3d. to 9d. The pargan\u00e1 of Kham\u00e1rp\u00e1n\u00ed produces the best breed of cattle for draught purposes. The cattle are white, with no great bulk of body, and the dewlap is unusually large; they appear closely akin to the pure Gujar\u00e1t breed, and are quite distinct from what are locally called the Gond cattle, a smaller kind but famous as good milk-yielders.\n\nCommerce and Trade.\u2014The weaving of cotton cloth constitutes the only important manufacture in Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1. In Lodh\u00edkher\u00e1 and some other places, excellent brass and copper utensils were formerly made, but the industry has fallen off considerably of late years. The village markets supply the means for carrying on trade within the District. The only so-called imperial road, by which a little external traffic is carried on, runs between Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 and N\u00e1gpur, descending into the low country by the Sil\u00e1w\u00e1n\u00ed gh\u00e1t. The descent has been rendered easy; but from R\u00e1m\u00e1kon\u00e1 to the limits of Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 District, the line lies over a very difficult country, chiefly consisting of black cotton-soil, cut up incessantly by watercourses with deep channels and muddy beds. The local roads are practicable during fine weather for wheeled conveyances, except in the hilly country of the zam\u00ednud\u00e1r\u00eds, where the natural difficulties are so great that the journey is rarely attempted except by camels, pack-bullocks, or buffaloes. The imperial road has d\u00e1k bungalows at Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 and R\u00e1m\u00e1kon\u00e1, and also station bungalows for the Public Works Department at Borg\u00e1on and Umr\u00e1n\u00e1l\u00e1, at Amraw\u00e1l\u00e1 on the Narsinghpur road, and at Gonaw\u00e1r\u00ed on the Pachmarhi road. There are sar\u00edth\u00e1s at Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1, R\u00e1m\u00e1kon\u00e1, Lodh\u00edkher\u00e1, Sausar, Pandhurna, Amarw\u00e1r\u00e1, and Chaur\u00e1i.\n\nAdministration.\u2014In 1854, Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 was formed into a separate District of the British Government of the Central Provinces. It is administered by a Deputy Commissioner, with 1 Assistant and 2 tahstld\u00e1rs. Total revenue in 1881-82, \u00a337,616; of which the land revenue yielded \u00a322,146. Total cost of District officials and police of all kinds, \u00a38552. Number of civil and revenue judges of all sorts within the District, 6; magistrates, 5. Maximum distance from any village to the nearest court, 64 miles; average distance, 29 miles. Number of police, 383, costing \u00a34461, being one policeman to every 10 square miles and to every 973 of the population. Daily average number\nof convicts in jail in 1881, 73'44, of whom 4'91 were females. The number of Government or aided schools in the District in 1881 was 35, attended by 1842 pupils.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate above the gh\u00fats is temperate and healthy. In the cold season, frost is not uncommon. Before May, the hot wind causes little annoyance, and during the rains the weather is cool and agreeable. Average annual rainfall, 43'22 inches; rainfall in 1881-82, 51'95 inches, or 8'73 inches above the average. The number of deaths registered during the same year was 7733, of which fevers caused 3678. Two charitable dispensaries during that year afforded medical relief to 13,017 in-door and out-door patients. [For further information regarding Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1, see the Settlement Report of the District, by W. Ramsay, C.S., 1867. Also the Central Provinces Gazetteer, by Charles Grant, Esq., C.S. (second edition, N\u00e1gpur, 1870, pp. 162-169); the Census Report of the Central Provinces for 1881; and the Annual Administration Reports of these Provinces from 1880 to 1883.]\n\nChhindw\u00e1r\u00e1.\u2014Sub-division or tahs\u00edl in the north of Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 District, Central Provinces. Area, 2827 square miles; number of villages, 1426; occupied houses, 50,953. Population (1881) 262,090, namely, males 130,746, and females 131,344; average density of population, 92'71 persons per square mile; Government revenue and cesses levied from the landholders, \u00a312,821; rental, including cesses, paid by the cultivators, \u00a322,495, or 1s. 1\u00bdd. per cultivated acre. The tahs\u00edl contains 4 civil and 4 criminal courts, with 14 police stations (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), including outposts; strength of regular police force, 133 men; village watchmen (chaukiddars), 822.\n\nChhindw\u00e1r\u00e1.\u2014Chief town and administrative head-quarters of Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 District, Central Provinces. Lat. 22\u00b0 3' 30\" N.; long. 78\u00b0 59' E. Situated on a dry, gravelly soil, 2200 feet above sea-level, and surrounded by ranges of low hills, with a belt of cultivated fields and mango groves between. The supply of water is plentiful, but that used for drinking comes from the wells outside the town. Population (1881) 8220, namely, Hindus, 5777; Kabirpanthis, 162; Muhammadans, 1757; Jains, 224; Christians, 57; aborigines, 243. Municipal income (1881) \u00a3712; rate of taxation, 1s. 8d. per head. The station is in parts well wooded. It has a public garden, District court-house, Commissioner's circuit house, jail, tahs\u00edli and police station, charitable dispensary, Free Church mission, Anglo-vernacular school, and sar\u00e1\u00ed.\n\nChhipia.\u2014Small village in Gond\u00e1 District, Oudh. Lat. 22\u00b0 3' 30\" N.; long. 78\u00b0 59' 0\" E. Of no commercial importance, and only noticeable for its handsome temple, erected in honour of a celebrated Vishnuvite religious reformer in Western India, named Sah\u00e1janand,\nwho was born in this village about a century ago, and ultimately succeeded to the headship of the great Vishnuvite monastery at Jun\u00e1garh. His followers claim for him divine honours as an incarnation of Krishna, and worship him under the title of Sw\u00e1mi N\u00e1r\u00e1yan. His descendants are still at the head of the sect. About thirty years ago, the sect which he had founded in Gujar\u00e1t determined to erect a temple at his birthplace, the whole of the works of which are not yet completed. The fane itself is entirely of stone and marble, imported from M\u00edrz\u00e1pur and Jaipur (Jeypore). It is to be surrounded on three sides by charitable buildings for the convenience of travellers and the accommodation of the members of the order. The north side is already finished, and consists of a row of double-storied brick houses, with a fine wooden verandah, carved and painted. The unfinished buildings to the front are broken by a handsome stone arch 20 feet high, and closed by a strong iron door, imported from Gujar\u00e1t. Behind the temple is a large b\u00e1z\u00e1r, and two square brick houses, with turrets at each corner, for the accommodation of the spiritual chiefs of the order. Two large fairs are held here annually, on the occasion of the R\u00e1m-n\u00e1mi festival, and at the full moon of K\u00e1rtik. Throughout the year, pilgrims of all classes of society, and from the most distant parts of India, visit the birthplace of their deified leader.\n\n**Chhol\u00e1.**\u2014Lofty range of the Him\u00e1layas, forming the eastern boundary of Sikkim, and separating it from Bh\u00fat\u00e1n and Tibet. It runs south from the immense mountain of Danki\u00e1 (23,176 feet), situated 50 miles east-north-east of K\u00e1nchanjang\u00e1, and is, throughout its length, much higher than the parallel Singalila range, which forms the western boundary between Sikkim and Nep\u00e1l. The most northern pass is the Tankra (16,000 feet), from the Lachung valley to the Ammochu valley. Next in order towards the south is the well-known Chhol\u00e1 pass (14,500 feet). This pass is on the direct route from Tumlong, the winter residence of the Sikkim R\u00e1j\u00e1, to Chumbi, his summer residence in Tibet. Seven miles south of the Chhol\u00e1 pass is the Jelep pass (14,400 feet), much frequented by Tibet traders with D\u00e1rjiling, and connected with that station by a good bridle road. South of the Jelep pass, the range is a wilderness of forest.\n\n**Chhot\u00e1 Bh\u00e1g\u00edrath\u00ed.**\u2014A branch of the Ganges in Maldah District, Bengal. Only navigable during the rains, and almost dry in the hot season. It is, however, the old bed of the great river itself, and is still revered as at least equal in holiness to any other part of the Ganges. The course of the Chhot\u00e1 Bh\u00e1g\u00edrath\u00ed is first east and then south, bordering for 13 miles the ruins of the city of Gaur. It eventually falls into the P\u00e1gl\u00e1 or P\u00e1gl\u00ed, a larger offshoot of the Ganges given off farther down; and before regaining the parent stream it encloses an extensive island, 16 miles in length, forming the south part of Maldah District.\nChhota N\u00e1gpur.\u2014Division or Commissionership, Bengal.\u2014See Chutia Nagpur.\n\nChhot\u00e1 Sinchul\u00e1 (or Tchinchul\u00e1).\u2014Peak in the Sinchul\u00e1 or Tchinchul\u00e1 range, Jalpaiguri District, Bengal, separating British and Bh\u00fat\u00e1n territory. Elevation, 5695 feet above sea-level; distant about 7 miles north of the military cantonment of Baxa.\n\nChhota Udaipur.\u2014State under the Political Agency of Rew\u00e1 K\u00e1ntha, in the Province of Guj\u00e1r\u00e1t (Guz\u00e9r\u00e1t), Bombay Presidency, lying between 22\u00b0 2' and 22\u00b0 32' N. lat., and between 73\u00b0 47' and 74\u00b0 20' E. long. Bounded north by the State of B\u00e1ria, east by \u00c1li R\u00e1jpur, south by petty States in the S\u00e1nkheri Mew\u00e1s, and west by the territory of the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda. Estimated area, 873 square miles; population (1881) 71,218, of whom 86 per cent. are Bhils or Kol\u00eds; revenue, \u00a316,000. The river Orsing runs through the State, dividing it into two nearly equal portions; the Narbad\u00e1 (Nerbudda) washes its southern boundary for a few miles. The country is hilly, and overgrown with forest. During the greater part of the year, the climate is damp and unhealthy, and fever is prevalent. Cereals and timber are the chief produce. There are no manufactures or mines. The principal exports are timber and flowers of the mah\u00fa\u00ed tree (Bassia latifolia). The family of the chief are Chauh\u00e1n R\u00e1jputs, who, when driven out of their former territories by the advance of the Musalm\u00e1ns about the year A.D. 1244, entered Guj\u00e1r\u00e1t, and took possession of Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner city and fort. On the capture of Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner in 1484 by Muhammad Beg\u00e1r, they withdrew to the wilder parts of their former possessions east of the city, one branch of them founding the State of B\u00e1ria, and the other the State of Chhota Udaipur. In the disturbances of 1858, the chief refused to hold any communication with T\u00e1nti\u00e1 Topi, one of the leaders of the rebellion, and prepared to defend himself against any attempt to enter his capital. It was when encamped before the town of Chhota Udaipur that T\u00e1nti\u00e1 Topi was defeated by General Parke. The Chief bears the title of Mah\u00e1r\u00e1wal. His house follows the rule of primogeniture, but holds no sanad of adoption. He is entitled to a salute of 9 guns, and maintains a military force of 320 undisciplined men, who are employed for police and revenue purposes. He has power to try his own subjects only for capital offences. A tribute of \u00a31014 is yearly payable to the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda, the amount being collected by the British Government. The family moved at one time to Mohan, a most advantageous position for commanding the passes, and built a fort there. Hence the State is sometimes called Mohan. But this place, as the capital, was given up for Chhota Udaipur. It was probably in consequence of the defenceless position of the latter town, that the chiefs became tributary to the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r. The political control has since 1822 been transferred to the British Government. The main route from\nM\u00e1lw\u00e1 to Baroda and the sea passes through the territory. There are 11 schools in the State, with an average daily attendance of 348 pupils. On account of the maladministration of the late Chief, a system of joint administration has been introduced as a temporary measure by the British Government, and an administrator appointed to aid the Chief in carrying out necessary reforms.\n\n**Chhota Udaipur.**\u2014Principal town of the State of Chhota Udaipur, in Gujar\u00e1t, Bombay Presidency; situated on the main road from Baroda to Mhau (Mhow), about 50 miles east of Baroda, 115 miles west of Mhow, 105 miles south-east of Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d, and 110 miles north-east of Surat; in 22\u00b0 20' N. lat., and 74\u00b0 1' E. long.\n\n**Chhuik\u00e1d\u00e1n** (or Kondka).\u2014Petty State in the Central Provinces. \u2014See Kondka.\n\n**Chhuik\u00e1d\u00e1n.**\u2014Principal village in Kondka or Chhuik\u00e1d\u00e1n chiefship, attached to R\u00e1ipur District, Central Provinces.

Area, 402 square miles; houses, 39,005; population (1881) 200,419, namely, 97,895 males and 102,524 females. Number of villages, 301, including 3 towns. Formerly the central division of the ancient Buddhist and Hindu kingdoms of Kalinga (Kielingkia of Hwen Thsang), and containing the capital of the Mughal 'circar' (sark\u00e1r) of Chicacole. Down to A.D. 1568, it was part of the territory of the Gajapati R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Orissa; but shortly after the overthrow of that sovereignty, in the year mentioned, by the invasion of the Muhammadan general of Bengal, the whole of the sark\u00e1rs as far as Chicacole came under the Kutab-Sh\u00e1hi rule, and their governors resided in the town. But it was not until 1724 that Hindu influence finally succumbed, when Asaf Jah, the great Viceroy of the Deccan, and the first Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk, took actual possession, collected the revenue, and appointed a civil and military establishment. With the rest of the 'Northern Circars,' it was assigned by the Niz\u00e1m to the French in 1753, and to the British in 1766. Under Muhammadan rule, Chicacole was divided\ninto the three divisions of Ich\u00e1pur, K\u00e1simkota, and Chicacole. The last two, on British occupation, became parts of Vizagapatam District, the demesne lands \u2018Chikakor-havili\u2019 being leased to the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Vizian\u00e1garam till 1787, when they came under direct administration. In 1802, Chicacole was transferred to Ganj\u00e1m. North of the town of Chicacole, the country is open, level, and well watered, studded with groves and marked by stretches of rice lands; to the south, the soil is dry and rocky, bearing traces of iron and interspersed with granite boulders. Land revenue (1883), \u00a345,344. The t\u00e1luk contains 1 civil and 3 criminal courts, with 6 police stations (th\u00e1n\u00e1s); strength of police force, 93 men.\n\n**Chicacole** *(Chikakol, Srik\u00e1kulam).*\u2014Town in the Chicacole t\u00e1luk, Ganj\u00e1m District, Madras Presidency; situated 4 miles from the sea on the Languliya or N\u00e1gavali river (here bridged), and on the Grand Trunk Road, 567 miles north-east of Madras. Lat. $18\u00b0\\ 17'\\ 25''$ N., long. $83\u00b0\\ 56'\\ 25''$ E.; houses, 3008; population (1881) 16,355, namely, 15,087 Hindus, 1184 Muhammadans, and 84 Christians and \u2018others.\u2019 Twenty per cent. of the population are traders; and eight per cent. muslin-weavers, the manufactures of Chicacole rivalling in delicacy of texture those of Dacca or Arni. The municipal revenue averages \u00a3702 per annum, the incidence of taxation being about 10d. per head of the rateable population. For many years considered an important military station; for a time (in 1815), the civil head-quarters of the District; and, until 1865, the sessions station of the District judge. As the head-quarters of the t\u00e1luk, it now contains subordinate revenue, judicial, and magisterial establishments; jail, dispensary, post and telegraph offices, schools, and hospital. Most of the public buildings are situated within the ditch of the old fort, to the south of which lies the native town, a straggling, cramped collection of houses, but containing many mosques\u2014notably that of Sher Muhammad Kh\u00e1n (1641), the *Faujd\u00e1r* or military governor of the Kutab Sh\u00e1h\u00ed dynasty of Golkonda\u2014to bear witness to the importance of the old city under its Muhammadan rulers. In 1791, Chicacole was nearly depopulated by famine, and it again suffered severely from scarcity in 1866. In 1876, a flood threatened it with utter destruction, and swept away six arches of the Languly\u00e1 bridge. The native names of the place are (Hindu) Srik\u00e1kulam; and (Muhammadan) Mahf\u00faz Bandar, after the small port so called at the mouth of the river,\u2014Mahf\u00faz Kh\u00e1n being the son of the celebrated *Faujd\u00e1r* of Chicacole, named Anwarudd\u00edn Kh\u00e1n, afterwards Naw\u00e1b of Arcot. It was also once called G\u00falchan\u00e1b\u00e1d, the \u2018happy rose-garden.\u2019 The name Chicacole (Srik\u00e1kulam) has been erroneously derived from *sikka*, a seal, and *kolna*, to open, as the letter-bags from Golkonda to the \u2018Northern Circars\u2019 used to be opened here for distribution.\u2014See \u2018Northern Circars.\u2019\nChicacole (Chikakol, Srikkulam).\u2014River in Madras Presidency.\u2014See Languliya.\n\nChich\u00e1li.\u2014Mountains in the Punjab.\u2014See Maidani.\n\nChichgarh.\u2014Extensive but poor estate or zamindari, near the southeastern borders of Bhandar District, Central Provinces.

The forests abound in valuable timber, especially teak. Each of the two chief villages, Chichgarh and Palandur, are Government police outposts, and the former possesses an indigenous school. One of the main District roads passes through this chiefship by a formidable pass near Chichgarh, more than 3 miles in length, bordered by dense bamboo jungle. At the foot of the pass the chief has dug a well and built a sarai.\n\nChichli.\u2014Town in Gadarwara tahsil, Narsinghpur District, Central Provinces.

The usual road from the latter place winds up the western side of the Gawilgarh Hill; but a new line, giving easier access to the sanitarium, has been laid out and is in course of completion. The ascent is for the most part easy, and is made on horseback. Supplies and baggage are brought up by bullocks or camels. Chikalda has been a favourite Berar sanitarium since 1839, when the first bungalows were built on the plateau. The climate is equable, cool, and bracing; mean temperature, 71\u00b0 F., varying from 59\u00b0 in the coldest to 83\u00b0 in the hottest months.

Excellent potatoes are grown, and the tea-plant flourishes; coffee of fine quality has also been successfully grown in one of the private gardens. Till the completion of the new road above alluded to, carts can only reach Chikalda via Ghatong, a distance of 30 miles.\nChik\u00e1ti.\u2014Estate in Ganj\u00e1m District, Madras Presidency. Number of houses, 11,913; population (1881) 40,684, of whom all but 36 are Hindus.

The fort was erected about 1479 by Malla Baire Gauda, the youngest of the band of refugees of the Morasu Wokkal tribe, who founded the P\u00e1leg\u00e1r dynasty throughout Mysore during the 14th century. His descendants extended their dominions, and maintained their independence against the rising power of the Hindu R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Mysore. Haidar Ali, however, in 1761 captured both Chikballapur and the hill fort of Nandidr\u00fag (Nundydroog), and sent the last of the Gaudas prisoner to Coimbatore.\n\nChik Devar\u00e1j S\u00e1g\u00e1r.\u2014Small canal, and scene of a fair in Mysore District, Mysore State.\u2014See Chunchankatte.\n\nChikhli (Chikoli).\u2014Petty Bhil (Bheel) State of Kh\u00e1ndesh District, Bombay Presidency; situated between the T\u00e1pti river and the S\u00e1tpr\u00fc range.

Sub-judge's court and post-office.\n\n**Chilambaram** *(Chedambaran or Chittambaram).*\u2014T\u00e1luk or Sub-division in the South Arcot District, Madras Presidency. Area, 254,425 acres (393 square miles), of which 192,830 acres are cultivated; population (1881) 265,250, namely, 248,224 Hindus, 11,557 Muhammadans (all Sunnis), 5467 Christians (chiefly Roman Catholics), and 2 'others;' distributed in 2 towns and 428 villages, and occupying 38,130 houses. Chief towns, CHILAMBARAM and PORTO Novo. Land revenue demand in 1882\u201383, \u00a366,332. In the same year, the Sub-division contained 1 civil and 2 criminal courts, with 12 police stations (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), and a police force numbering 118 men.\n\n**Chilambaram** *(or, more correctly, Chittambalam, 'the atmosphere of wisdom').\u2014Town and head-quarters of Chilambaram t\u00e1luk, South Arcot District, Madras Presidency; 7 miles from the coast and 25 miles south of Cuddalore. Lat. 11\u00b0 24' 9\" N., long. 79\u00b0 44' 7\" E. Houses, 4365. Population (1881) 19,837, namely, 18,583 Hindus, 1154 Muhammadans, and 100 Christians. As the head-quarters of the t\u00e1luk, it contains subordinate revenue, judicial, and police establishments; post-office, travellers' bungalow, etc. The weaving of silk and cotton cloth occupies 27 per cent. of the total adult population. In December, a great fair is held, attracting from 50,000 to 60,000 pilgrims and traders. Municipal revenue (1881\u201382) \u00a31324; incidence of taxation, about 2s. per head of the rateable population. During the wars of the Karnatic, Chilambaram was considered a point of considerable strategical importance. In 1749, the ill-fated expedition under Captain Cope, against Devikot\u00e1, made a stand here in its retreat; and here, in the following year, the armies of Mur\u00e1ri R\u00e1o and Muzaffar Jang first met. In 1753, the British garrison was compelled to evacuate Chilambaram by the French, and the muster of the French and Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 forces for the campaign of the following year was held at this town. An attempt by the British to take the place in 1759 failed. In 1760, the French\nsurrendered it to Haidar Al\u00ed, who strengthened the fortifications and garrisoned the town; and when Sir Eyre Coote attacked Chilambaram in 1781, he was driven off with loss.\n\nBut it is for its temples, held in the highest reverence throughout Southern India and Ceylon, that Chilambaram is chiefly celebrated. The principal of these is the Sabhanaiken Kovil or Kanak Sahbh\u00e1 (golden shrine), sacred to Siva and his wife P\u00e1rvat\u00ed. Tradition asserts that the earliest portions of this splendid structure were built by Hiranya Varna Chakrasti, \u2018the golden-coloured king,\u2019 who was here cured of leprosy; and as this name occurs in the Chronicles of Kashmir as that of a king who conquered Ceylon, some writers are of opinion that this temple is really the work of a Kashmir prince of the 5th century. He is said to have brought 3000 Br\u00e1hmans with him from the north; and to this day the temple belongs to some 250 families of a peculiar sect of Br\u00e1hmans called Dikshatars.\n\nThe management of the pagoda may be described as a domestic hierarchy. All the male married members of the Dikshatar caste or sect, no matter of what age, have equal shares in its control, and a single dissentient voice prevents the execution of any project. As soon as a boy is married, generally as soon after the age of five as possible, he enters into all the privileges of a managing director. They only marry among themselves, never with any other class of Br\u00e1hmans, and they say that there are no members of their sect in any other part of India. In 1878, there were 253 married members who managed the institution, 20 of whom are always on duty at a time for a period of 20 days, which it takes to perform the complete ceremonial tour at the different shrines in the temple, where daily puja or offerings are made. On ordinary occasions, the daily offerings of rice and money are the property of the 20 Dikshatars on duty; but on occasions of festival, or other special ceremonials, when the offerings are unusually large, the proceeds are equally divided among the whole body of managers. All the Dikshatars in turn visit the whole of Southern India, from Madras to Cape Comorin, to collect alms and offerings, each individual retaining the proceeds of his own collection. No Dikshatar will visit a house where he knows that another of the sect has already been, although in a single village there may be half a dozen collecting alms from their different constituents at the same time. The right of performing the ceremonies for a particular family descends among the Dikshatars from father to son, and even to the widow if there is no son.\n\nIn the 8th century, Pandya Vachakka defeated the Banddhas of Ceylon in an attempt upon the temple; and between the 10th and 17th centuries, the Chola and Chera R\u00e1j\u00e1s made many additions to the building. It now covers 39 acres of ground. Two walls, each 30 feet in height,\nsurround it; and at each of the four corners stands a solid gopuram or pyramid 122 feet in height, faced with granite blocks 40 feet in length and 5 feet thick, covered with copper. The principal court, called 'the hall of a thousand pillars' (though really containing only 936), presents a magnificent appearance. In the centre is the shrine of P\u00e1rvat\u00ed, a most beautiful building, containing a golden canopy, with superb fringes of bullion; and also the sanctuary, a copper-roofed enclosure, remarkable for its ugliness. Opposite to it stands the Miratha Sabh\u00e1, pronounced by some writers the most perfect gem of art in Southern India. Besides these there are other sabh\u00e1s, or halls; a Vishnu temple; a Pillyar temple, containing the largest belly-god in India; a remarkable tank, the Sivagang\u00e1 or Hemapashkarani (golden tank), 50 yards square and 40 feet across, surrounded on all sides with spacious flights of steps; and four excellent wells, one of them built of granite rings placed one on the other, each ring cut from a single block. To appreciate the labour bestowed upon this extraordinary temple, it must be remembered that the greater part of it is of granite\u2014with many monoliths 40 feet high, and over 1000 pillars (all monoliths, and none less than 26 feet in height)\u2014and that the nearest quarry is 40 miles distant. Besides the temple, there is nothing remarkable in the town, except the large number of chatrams, or native rest-houses (about 70), with which it abounds. The largest is said to be capable of holding 800 or 900 persons.\n\nChili\u00e1nw\u00e1la.\u2014Village in Phali\u00e1n tahs\u00edl, Gujr\u00e1t District, Punjab, lying 5 miles from the eastern bank of the Jehlam (Jhelum); distant from Lahore 85 miles north-west, in lat. 32\u00b0 39' 46\" N., long. 73\u00b0 38' 52\" E. Celebrated as the site of a sanguinary battle in the second Sikh War. Lord Gough, after marching several days from the Chen\u00e1b, came in sight of the enemy near Chili\u00e1nw\u00e1la on the afternoon of the 13th January 1849. While his men were engaged in taking ground for an encampment, a few shots from the Sikh horse artillery fell within his lines. The General thereupon gave the order for an immediate attack; and our forces moved rapidly forward through the thick jungle, in the face of masked batteries, which again and again opened a flank fire upon their unguarded line. Beaten back time after time, they still advanced upon the unseen enemy, until at last, by some misapprehension, a regiment of cavalry began to retreat in a somewhat disorderly manner. Although by this time our troops had taken some 15 or 16 of the enemy's guns, and our artillery had swept the Sikh line from end to end, the unfortunate panic amongst the cavalry, the loss of almost an entire British regiment (the 24th), and the approach of darkness combined to prevent our continuing the action. The Sikhs remained in possession of more than one British gun, besides holding some of our colours. At the end of the engagement, the British troops maintained\ntheir position, and the enemy retreated during the night. Our temporary loss of prestige was fully retrieved by the decisive battle of Gujr\u00e1t, a month later, which placed the whole Punjab in the power of Lord Gough. An obelisk, erected upon the spot, commemorates the British officers and men who lost their lives upon the field, which is known to the people of the neighbourhood as Katalgarh, or the 'house of slaughter.' Chili\u00e1nw\u00e1la is identified by General Cunningham with the battle-field of Alexander and Porus after the passage of the river Jehlam.\n\n**Chilk\u00e1 Lake.**\u2014A shallow inland sea, situated in the south-east corner of Puri District, Orissa, and in the extreme south extending into the Madras District of Ganj\u00e1m. Lat. $19\u00b028'$ to $19\u00b056'15\"$ N., long. $85\u00b09'$ to $85\u00b038'15\"$ E. A long sandy ridge, in places little more than 200 yards wide, separates it from the Bay of Bengal. On the west and south it is walled in by lofty hills; while to the northward it loses itself in endless shallows, sedgy banks, and islands just peeping above the surface, formed year by year from the silt which the rivers bring down. A single narrow mouth, cut through the sandy ridge, connects it with the sea. The lake spreads out into a pear-shaped expanse of water 44 miles long, of which the northern half has a mean breadth of about 20 miles, while the southern half tapers into an irregularly-curved point, barely averaging 5 miles wide. Smallest area, 344 square miles in the dry weather, increasing to about 450 during the rainy season. Average depth, from 3 to 5 feet, scarcely anywhere exceeding 6 feet. The bed of the lake is a very few feet below the high-water level of the sea, although in some parts it is slightly below low-water mark. The distant inner portion of the lake keeps about 2 feet higher than the exterior ocean at all stages of the tide. The narrow tidal stream, which rushes through the neck connecting the lake with the sea, suffices to keep the water distinctly salt during the dry months from December to June. But once the rains have set in, and the rivers come pouring down upon its northern extremity, the sea-water is gradually driven out, and the Chilk\u00e1 passes through various stages of brackishness until it becomes a fresh-water lake. This changeable inland sea forms one of a series of lacustrine formations down the western shores of the Bay of Bengal, the result of a perpetual war going on between the rivers and the sea\u2014the former struggling to find vent for their water and silt, the latter repelling them with its sand-laden currents. The Chilk\u00e1 may be regarded as a gulf of the original Bay of Bengal. On the south, a bold, barren spur of hills runs down to the coast; on the north, the land-making rivers have pushed out their rounded mouths and flat deltas into the ocean. Nor has the sea been idle; but meeting and overpowering the languid river-discharge that enters the Chilk\u00e1, it has joined the two promonitories with a bar of sand, and thus formed a lake. At this moment the\ndelicate process of land-making from the river silt at the north-east end of the lake is slowly but steadily going on; while the bar-building sea busily plies its trade across its mouth. Old documents show that a century ago the neck of land was only from half a mile to a mile broad in places where it is now two miles. On the other hand, the opening in the bar, which was a mile wide in 1780, and had to be crossed in large boats, was described forty years later as choked up. Shortly before 1825, an artificial mouth had to be cut; and although this also rapidly began to silt up, it remained, as late as 1837, more than three times its present breadth. The villagers allege that it still grows narrower year by year; and the difficulty in maintaining an outlet from the Chilk\u00e1 forms one of the chief obstacles to utilizing the lake as an escapement for the floods that desolate the delta. Engineers report that although it would be easy and cheap to cut a channel, it would be very costly and difficult to keep it open; and that each successive mouth would speedily choke up and share the fate of its predecessors.\n\nThe scenery of the Chilk\u00e1 is very varied, and in parts exceedingly picturesque. In the south and west, hill ranges bound its shores; and in this part it is dotted with a number of small rocky islands. Proceeding northwards, the lake expands into a majestic sheet of water. Halfway across is Nalbana, literally 'the reed forest,' an island about 5 miles in circumference, scarcely anywhere rising more than a few inches above water-level. This island is altogether uninhabited, but is regularly visited by parties of thatchers from the mainland, who cut the reeds and high grasses with which it is completely covered. On the eastern side of the lake lie the islands of P\u00e1rik\u00fad, with new silt formations behind, and now partially joined to the narrow ridge of land which separates the Chilk\u00e1 from the sea. At some places they emerge almost imperceptibly from the water; at others, they spread out into well-raised rice-fields. Their northern extremity slopes gracefully down to the lake like an English park, dotted with fine trees, and backed by noble masses of foliage. Water-fowl of all kinds are very abundant in every part of the lake. Salt-making is largely carried on in P\u00e1rik\u00fad. Beyond the northern end of P\u00e1rik\u00fad, the lake gradually shallows until it becomes solid ground. At this point, the Pur\u00ed rivers empty themselves into the lake, and the process of land-making is going on steadily. The northern shores of the Chilk\u00e1 comprise the pargan\u00e1s of Sir\u00e1i and Chaub\u00edskud, and it is these tracts which have to bear the greatest suffering in times of general inundation in Pur\u00ed. Until Ganj\u00e1m was abandoned, on account of its unhealthiness, the Chilk\u00e1 lake was during the hot months a frequent resort of Europeans from the Madras Presidency. At the southern extremity of the lake stands the populous and important village of Rambh\u00e1, having an extensive trade in grain with Orissa, for which it gives salt in exchange. A steam launch plies between Rambh\u00e1 and\nBurukudi on the Puri side, a distance of about 34 miles. The Chilka Canal, connecting the southern extremity of the lake with the Rushikulya river, is 7 miles in length, and navigable throughout the year. Large quantities of grain and salt are carried to and fro along it.\n\n**Chilmari.**\u2014Village in Rangpur District, Bengal; situated on the banks of the Brahmaputra river.

Vernacular school and dispensary.\n\n**Chingleput.**\u2014District, taluk, and town in Madras Presidency.\u2014See Chengalput.\n\n**Ch\u00edni.**\u2014Village in Bashahr State, Punjab; situated about a mile from the right bank of the Sutlej (Satlaj), in a slight depression on the southern slope of a lofty mountain, in lat. $31^\\circ 31'$ N., and long. $78^\\circ 19'$ E. Elevation above the river, 1500 feet; above sea-level, 9085 feet. Naturally irrigated by a large number of little rills, and surrounded with vineyards, whose grapes, dried into raisins, form a principal article of food for the people. Large dogs, specially trained\nfor the purpose, deter the bears from plundering the vines. Chini was the favourite hill residence of Lord Dalhousie.\n\n**Chiniot.**\u2014Tahsil of Jhang District, Punjab; lying for the most part in the Rechna Do\u00e1b, but also extending a little beyond the Chen\u00e1b, between lat. $31^\\circ 30' 30''$ and $31^\\circ 50' 30''$ N., and long. $72^\\circ 35'$ and $73^\\circ 14'$ E., into the country immediately above its junction with the Jehlam (Jhelum). Area, 2,149 square miles. Population (1881) 128,241, namely, males 68,863, and females 59,378. Muhammadans number 112,173; Hindus, 15,369; Sikhs, 693; and 'others,' 6. Revenue (1883), \u00a313,921. The administrative staff consists of a tahsild\u00e1r and munisif, presiding over 1 criminal and 2 civil courts. Number of police stations (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), 5; strength of regular police, 100 men; village watchmen (chaukid\u00e1rs), 183.\n\n**Chiniot.**\u2014Town in Jhang District, Punjab, and head-quarters of Chiniot tahsil, situated 2 miles south of the present bed of the Chen\u00e1b, on the road from Jhang to Wazir\u00e1b\u00e1d. Lat. $31^\\circ 43' 32''$ N., long. $73^\\circ 0' 59''$ E. Population (1881) 10,731, namely, 3,475 Hindus, 7,143 Muhammadans, and 113 Sikhs; number of occupied houses, 1,088. Founded prior to the Musalm\u00e1n conquest of Upper India. The town suffered much from the Dur\u00e1n\u00ed inroads during the last half of the 18th century, and also during the troubles of 1848, being the scene of constant sanguinary struggles between the leaders of local factions. Chiniot now bears a prosperous aspect, and is a thriving town, most of the houses being of excellent brickwork, lofty and commodious, especially those of the Khoja traders, who have large business dealings with Amritsar, Calcutta, Bombay, and Kar\u00e1ch\u00ed. Handsome mosque built by Naw\u00e1b Sadull\u00e1 Kh\u00e1n Tah\u00edm, governor of the town in the reign of Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n; also a shrine dedicated to Sh\u00e1h Barh\u00e1n, a Muhammadan saint revered by Hindus and Muhammadans alike. Chiniot is celebrated for its wood-carving and masonry, and many of its masons are said to have been employed in building the T\u00e1j Mah\u00e1l at Agra. The architect of the golden temple at Amritsar was also a Chiniot man, and the head mason now attached to the building is another. Manufacture of coarse cloth. Exports of cotton, wool, gh\u00ed, bones, horns and hides. Besides the sub-divisional courts and offices, the town contains a good charitable dispensary, school-house, rest-house, etc., and a beautiful garden, well stocked with fruit-trees. The country is well wooded, and the surrounding scenery is attractive. Municipal revenue in 1881\u201382, \u00a3658, or rs. 2\u00bd d. per head of population.\n\n**Chinna Kimedi** (or Prat\u00e1gp\u00edr\u012b).\u2014Zamind\u00e1ri in Ganj\u00e1m District, Madras Presidency.\u2014See Kimedi.\n\n**Chinnamalpur.**\u2014Peak of the Eastern Gh\u00e1ts, in Ganj\u00e1m District, Madras Presidency.

Lat. $22^\\circ 53' 1''$ N., long. $88^\\circ 26' 40''$ E. Chinsurah is now included within the H\u00fagl\u00ed municipality, and the Census returns of 1881 do not distinguish between the two towns, which contained a joint population in that year of 31,177. See Hugli town. The Dutch established themselves at Chinsurah in the 17th century, and held the place till 1825, when it was ceded by the Netherlands Government to Great Britain. The town is neatly laid out. It was formerly used as an invalid depot for troops, and for regiments arriving from or proceeding to England; but within the last few years it has been abandoned as a military station. It contains a public library and printing-press.\n\n**Chintadrapet.**\u2014A quarter of Madras Town.\n\n**Chintaln\u00e1r.**\u2014Zamind\u00e1ri or estate in Bastar State, attached to Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 District, Central Provinces.

Lat. $13^\\circ 24' 20''$ N., long. $78^\\circ 5' 45''$ E. Population (1881) 5119, namely, Hindus, 4635; and Muhammadans, 484. Municipal revenue (1874\u201375), \u00a318; rate of taxation, 1d. per head. Named after its Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 founder, Chintamani R\u00e1o, and a seat of the Kumati or banking class. Considerable trade, chiefly in grain, gold, silver, and precious stones. The neighbourhood is famous for pomegranates. Until 1873, the town was the head-quarters of the Amb\u00e1j\u00ed-durg\u00e1 t\u00e1luk.\n\n**Chintpurn\u00ed** (or *Sola Singhi*).\u2014Mountain range in Hoshi\u00e1rpur District, Punjab, forming the eastern boundary of the Jasw\u00e1n D\u00fan. Commences at a point close to Talw\u00e1r\u00e1, on the Beas (Bi\u00e1s) river, and runs in a south-eastward direction between the Districts of Hoshi\u00e1rpur and K\u00e1ngra. Its highest point, at the encamping ground of Bharwa\u00edn, 28 miles from Hoshi\u00e1rpur on the Dharms\u00e1la road, is 3896 feet above the sea. Thence the ridge continues till it crosses the valley of the Sutlej (Satlaj), its northern slope sinking gradually into the Beas (Bi\u00e1s) basin, while its southward escarpment consists in places of an abrupt cliff about 300 feet in height. The space between its central line and the plain portion of the Jasw\u00e1n D\u00fan is occupied by a broad table-land, thickly clothed with forest, and intersected by precipitous ravines, which divide\nthe surface into natural blocks. The name Chintpurn\u00ed belongs not so much to the range of hills described above, as to the village of that name situated on the range, in Hoshi\u00e1rpur District, where is a famous shrine dedicated to the goddess Devi, to which thousands annually resort from considerable distances. Beyond the Sutlej, the chain assumes the name of the NALAGARH RANGE.\n\n**Chipl\u00fan.**\u2014Sub-division of Ratn\u00e1giri District, Bombay Presidency. Area, 670 square miles; contains 1 town and 211 villages. Population (1881) 168,921, namely, 80,048 males and 88,873 females. Hindus number 157,535; Muhammadans, 11,323; 'others,' 63. The Sub-division stretches from the coast inland to the watershed of the Sahy\u00e1dri range, and is throughout more or less hilly and rugged. The seaboard, with the exception of an open sandy roadstead, some five miles long, extending on each side of the village of Guh\u00e1gar, is broken and irregular. Close to the shore rise a series of high laterite plateaux, which stretch some ten miles inland, where they are succeeded by a belt of lower undulating land; but on meeting the spurs and ravines thrown out by the great mountain chain of the Sahy\u00e1dri range, the country becomes very rugged and precipitous. The only rivers of importance are the V\u00e1shishti on the north, and the Sh\u00e1stri on the south of the Sub-division, both of which are tidal for a distance of about 25 miles from their mouths, and are navigable within these limits by moderate-sized boats. The total area under cultivation in 1877\u201378, the latest year for which details are available, was 296,576 acres. Grain crops occupied 280,271 acres; pulses, 12,673 acres; oil-seeds, 2000 acres; fibres, 523 acres; miscellaneous crops, 1107 acres. Up to 1880, the Sub-division had not been fully surveyed. It contains 1 civil and 3 criminal courts, with 6 police stations (th\u00e1nd\u00e1s); strength of police force, 96 men.\n\n**Chipl\u00fan.**\u2014Chief town of Chipl\u00fan Sub-division, in Ratn\u00e1giri District, Bombay Presidency. Lat. 17\u00b0 31' 25\" N., long. 73\u00b0 33' 50\" E. Situated 108 miles south-east of Bombay, and about 25 miles from the coast, on the south bank of the river V\u00e1shishti, which is navigable for boats of nearly 2 tons. Population (1881) 12,065, namely, Hindus, 8853; Muhammadans, 3208; Jains, 3; and Christian, 1. Area of town site, 73 acres. A prosperous commercial town, situated near the head of the Kumbh\u00e1rli pass, one of the easiest routes from the Deccan to the seaboard. The town contains good roads, an efficient conservancy establishment is maintained, and the streets are lighted. The chief want of the place is a good water-supply, but this is now being remedied by the construction of a reservoir and aqueducts. Municipal revenue in 1882\u201383, \u00a31484, of which \u00a31012 was derived from taxation, or an average incidence of 1s. 8\u00bdd. per head; expenditure, \u00a31264. Sub-judge's court, telegraph, and post-office.\nAbout a quarter of a mile south of the town are some Buddhist excavations.\n\n**Chipurupalle.**\u2014Taluk of Vizagapatam District, Madras Presidency. Area, 535 square miles. Houses, 30,059, grouped into 268 villages, all zamindari. Population (1881) 138,896, almost all Hindus, or 69,197 males and 69,699 females.\n\n**Chipurupalle.**\u2014Estate in Vizagapatam District, Madras Presidency; consisting of one village, assessed at \u00a3381 per annum. Formerly part of the Panchad\u00e1r\u00e1 estate; but when that hunda was transferred to the Vizian\u00e1gram domains, within the ancient territorial limits of which it was found to lie, the remainder was named the Chipurupalle estate, after the most central village in it. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Vizian\u00e1gram bought the estate, which then contained 24 villages, for an annual payment of \u00a33623. Fifteen of the 24 villages have since lapsed to Government on account of arrears of revenue, and 8 others have been apportioned among as many different proprietors. The present estate, therefore, consists of one village only.\n\n**Chirakkal.**\u2014Taluk in Malab\u00e1r District, Madras Presidency. Area, 648 square miles, containing 1 town and 44 villages (amsams). Houses, 44,250. Population (1881) 272,669, namely, 132,715 males and 139,954 females. Chief town CANNANORE. Land revenue demand (1882-83), \u00a345,344. The taluk contains 2 criminal courts, but in civil matters is subject to the jurisdiction of the munsif's court at Tellicherry.\n\n**Chirakkal.**\u2014Township (amsam, or 'parish') in the Chirakkal taluk, Malab\u00e1r District, Madras Presidency; situated 3 miles north of Cannanore, in lat. 11\u00b0 54' N., and long. 75\u00b0 29' E. Houses, 1257. Population (1881) 8658, namely, 5818 Hindus, 2829 Muhammadans, and 11 Christians. Formerly head-quarters of the taluk, and still containing the Malab\u00e1r central jail. It was by grant from the Chirakkal or Kolattiri R\u00e1j\u00e1, whose descendant still lives in the neighbourhood, that the British first obtained a permanent footing at Tellicherri.\n\n**Chir\u00e1la.**\u2014Town in B\u00e1patla taluk, Kistna District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 16\u00b0 58' 20\" N., long. 80\u00b0 4' 10\" E. Houses, 1856. Population (1881) 9061, namely, 8652 Hindus and 409 Muhammadans. Formerly in Nellore District. Noted for its cotton manufactures. Dispensary.\n\n**Chiramkod.**\u2014Division or n\u00e1d of the Nilgiri District, Madras Presidency. Area, 41 square miles, comprising a single township or parish (amsam). Population (1881) 4280, namely, 2380 males and 1900 females; number of occupied houses, 731.\n\n**Chirang Dw\u00e1r.**\u2014One of the Dv\u00e1rs or sub-montane tracts conquered from Bh\u00fat\u00e1n in 1869, and now forming part of the Eastern Dv\u00e1rs, in Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1 District, Assam. Area, 495 square miles; population (1881) 1216. Almost the entire area is waste, the density of population being\nless than 3 persons per square mile. A tract of 225'60 square miles, or nearly one-half of the whole, has been set apart as forest reserves, and divided into 13 valuable sal forests. The settlement of the cultivated fields, which cover an aggregate of only 1329 acres, is effected by Government on the Assam system by annual engagements directly with the cultivators.\n\nChir\u00e1wa.\u2014Town in the Shaikhawati division of Jaipur (Jeypore) State, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. Population (1881) 5489, namely, Hindus, 3117; Muhammadans, 2123; and unspecified, 19.\n\nChirg\u00e1on.\u2014Town in Jh\u00e1nsi District, North-Western Provinces, situated in lat. 25\u00b0 35' N., and long. 78\u00b0 52' E., on the road to Cawnpur, 18 miles north-east of Jh\u00e1nsi, and 14 miles south-west of Moth. Population (1881) 3748, namely, Hindus, 3452; Muhammadans, 257; and 'others,' 39. A small municipal revenue, in the shape of a house-tax, is raised for police and conservancy purposes under the provisions of Act xx. of 1856. Chirg\u00e1on, with 25 other villages, was formerly the property of a Bundela Th\u00e1kur, a descendant of Bfr Singh Deo of Orchha, who held a sanad from the British Government. In 1841, R\u00e1o Bakht Singh, the ruling chief, was expelled for disloyalty; his fort was razed to the ground, and his whole estate confiscated. He was afterwards killed at Panw\u00e1ri. His surviving son, R\u00e1o Raghu\u0144ath Singh, was granted a pension of \u00a3300 a year, for services rendered during the Mutiny; and a pension of \u00a3150 has been continued to his son, Dal\u00edp Singh, the present (1883) chief.\n\nChirkh\u00e1ri.\u2014State and town in Bundelkhand, North-Western Provinces.\u2014See Charkhari.\n\nChitaldr\u00fag (Chitaldroog).\u2014District of the Nagar Division, Mysore Native State. Including the extreme limits of two long narrow projections into the Madras District of Bellary, it is situated between 13\u00b0 35' and 15\u00b0 2' N. lat., and between 75\u00b0 43' and 77\u00b0 30' E. long. Area, 4871 square miles. Population (1881) 376,310. On the north and north-east, Chitaldr\u00fag is bounded by the District of Bellary, in the Madras Presidency; on the south and south-east by T\u00famk\u00far District (Mysore); on the west by Kad\u00far and Shimoga Districts (Mysore); and on the north-west it is separated by the Tungabhadra river from the Bombay District of Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r. The administrative head-quarters are at the town of Chitaldr\u00fag.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The District is distinguished in Mysore for its low rainfall, and the arid, stony character of the soil. It consists for the most part of the valley of the Vedav\u00e1ti or Hagari river, a tributary of the Tungabhadra, running from south-west to north-east; and it is traversed crosswise by a belt of intermittent parallel chains of low hills. The highest summits of these hills are from 2800 to 3800 feet above sea-level. The rest of the District is an open plain, entirely\nCHITALDRUG.\n\ndestitute of picturesque features, with an average elevation of about 2000 feet. The Vedavati river occupies a wide sandy bed, which is almost dry of water during the hot months, except where wells are sunk for irrigation. The Tungabhadra river forms the north-western boundary for a few miles, and the Northern Pinakini enters the District on the extreme east for an equally short distance. In no part of Chitaldrug are trees numerous; and the present sterile condition of the country is attributed to the reckless destruction of the former forests. Rich grass for pasturage abounds in certain tracts, and the soil is productive wherever it can be artificially watered. The well-known 'black cotton-soil,' interspersed with sandy patches, prevails in the north and west; in the south, the earth is largely impregnated with salt, which is favourable to the production of the cocoa-nut; and towards the east, the surface soil is light and sandy, and abounds in springs, which form so prominent a feature in the agriculture of the neighbouring Districts of Tumkur and Bellary. The central range of hills presents a succession of different formations. In the south, the hills are mainly composed of a ferruginous clayey slate, topped with magnetic ironstone; about Chitaldrug is found the prevailing syenite of Mysore, with felspar and mica; while towards the north, the lower ridges consist of a compound in which chlorite, oxide of iron, and hornblende appear. Among minerals may be mentioned iron-ore in various forms, asbestos, potstone, slate, actinolite, and carbonate of soda. The wild animals include the tiger, panther, bear, hyena, and wild hog. As elsewhere in Mysore, trees have been planted out in avenues along the public roads, and the cultivators are encouraged to grow groves of their own; but the trees thus planted are kept alive with much difficulty, and there is not sufficient timber in the District to serve for the local demands of housebuilding.\n\nHistory.\u2014The history of Chitaldrug is chiefly associated with the names of the palegars or petty chieftains, who rose to independence during the 17th century. The most ancient site in the District is the village of Nirgunda, which is proved by inscriptions of the 5th century A.D. to have been the capital of a Jain principality, tributary to the Ganga Empire. It is believed that descendants of the Ganga line continued to govern the country during the predominance of the Chalukya and Ballala dynasties. When the latter kingdom was overthrown by the Muhammadans in the 14th century, the Hindu sovereigns of Vijayanagar became paramount over all Southern India; but the remoteness of their authority allowed numerous feudatories to assert semi-independence. Foremost amongst these were the palegars of Chitaldrug, Nidugal, and Nayakanhatti. The Chitaldrug family belong to the Bedar, or Boya, caste, who subsist by hunting and tending cattle. The Bedar caste corresponds to the Kiratas of Sanskrit\nwriters. The founder of the family obtained possession of the hill fort of Chitaldr\u00fag in about the year 1508; and, by the help of his warlike tribesmen, his descendants gradually extended their power over the greater part of the present District. During the wars which followed from the disputes between the Muhammadans of Bij\u00e1pur, the Mughals, and the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, the Chitaldr\u00fag p\u00e0leg\u00e1r served as a valuable auxiliary on the one side or the other; but, like the rest of the local chieftains, he fell before the conquering armies of Haidar Al\u00ed. In 1779, the fort of Chitaldr\u00fag, which had been besieged by Haidar Al\u00ed on more than one occasion, was surrendered to him by treachery; he sent the ruling family prisoners to Seringapatam, transported the inhabitants in a body to people his capital, and enlisted the young boys of the Bedar caste in his own battalions. The p\u00e0leg\u00e1r of Nidugal was conquered by Haidar Al\u00ed at about the same time, though the family survived to be finally extirpated by Tip\u00fa in 1792. They are said to have been descended from a R\u00e1jput immigrant, to whom the country was granted by the Vijayanagar sovereign in the 16th century. The hill fort of Nidugal became their residence after they had been driven from the plains by the Musalm\u00e1n Naw\u00e1b of S\u00edra. The N\u00e1ya-kanhatti family were chiefs of smaller note, whose territory had been absorbed by the Chitaldr\u00fag p\u00e0leg\u00e1r before the days of Haidar Al\u00ed. On the death of Tip\u00fa, in 1799, Chitaldr\u00fag was included in the dominions of the resuscitated Hindu R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Mysore. The west and south suffered during the disturbances of 1830, which led to the intervention of the Indian Government in 1831; and the entire State remained under direct British administration until 1881. In March 1881, Mysore State was restored to native rule, but the administration after the British fashion by Divisions and Districts has not been changed in any important feature.\n\nPopulation.\u2014A kh\u00e1na-sum\u00e1ri, or house enumeration of the people, in 1853-54, returned a total of 289,495 persons. The regular Census of 1871 ascertained the number to be 531,360, showing an increase of more than 83 per cent. in the interval of eighteen years, if the earlier estimate can be trusted. The Census of 1881, however, discloses a great falling off in population. The number returned in 1881 is 376,310, or a decrease since 1871 of 155,050. This decrease is due to the severe famine which afflicted Southern India in 1876-78. The area of Chitaldr\u00fag, 4871 square miles, gives an average of 77 persons per square mile, the lowest average in Mysore State. The most densely-populated taluk in the District is D\u00e1vangere. Classified according to sex, the population is composed of 190,017 males and 186,293 females; proportion of males, 50 per cent. The occupation tables return 89,367 male adults as connected with agriculture, and 18,305 as composing the manufacturing and artisan classes. The\nreligious division of the people shows the following totals\u2014Hindus, 362,502, or 97 per cent.; Muhammadans, 13,665, or 3 per cent.; Christians, 143. Among Hindus, the Br\u0101hmans number 6905; the claimants to the rank of Kshatriya or R\u0101jput, 237; the Komatis, 3827; and the Jains, 636. Of inferior castes, one of the most numerous is the Bedar (62,214), hunters, whose chief was the former p\u0101leg\u016br or Chitaldrug. The Ling\u0101yats, a trading class who have always been influential in this part of the country, and have supplied several families of petty p\u0101leg\u016brs, number in Chitaldrug District 88,094; Vakkaligars, agriculturists, 9873; Kunchigars, 21,052. Out-castes are returned at 40,549, and wandering tribes at 6442. The chief feature in this ethnical classification is the small proportion of the pure Hindu castes, as compared with the rest of Mysore State. The Muhammadans, who muster strongest in the t\u0101luk of D\u0101vangere, are almost all of the Sunn\u012b sect. Out of the total of 143 Christians, 5 are Europeans and 28 Eurasians, leaving 110 for the native converts. According to another principle of classification, there are 29 Protestants and 114 Roman Catholics.\n\nThe District contains 1420 towns and villages, with 70,751 occupied and 15,471 unoccupied houses. As compared with the area and the population, these figures give the following averages:\u2014Villages per square mile, '29; houses per square mile, 17'7; persons per village, 265; persons per house, 5'32. The only place in the District containing more than 5000 inhabitants is D\u0101vangere (6362), the chief centre of trade and manufacture, and the residence of many wealthy Ling\u0101yats. Other considerable centres are:\u2014Harihar, where a native regiment used formerly to be stationed, on the Tungabhadra river, here crossed by a masonry bridge, erected at a cost of \u00a335,000; Chitaldrug, the civil head-quarters of the District, but abandoned as a military cantonment on account of its unhealthiness; and Turvanur. On the Jogimath, one of the highest hills immediately south of Chitaldrug town, a teak plantation and sanitarium have been formed.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014The greater part of the food-supply is furnished by \u2018dry crops,\u2019 among which the following are the most important:\u2014Ragi (Cynosurus corocanus); jo\u0101r (Holcus sorghum) and navane (Panicum italicum), two varieties of millet; and the pulses, kadali (Cicer arietinum), togari (Cajanus indicus), and hurali (Dolichos uniflorus). Rice is only grown in the river valleys. Cotton is extensively raised in certain tracts, and in the south there are large groves of cocoa-nut palms. In the east, the soil is so sterile, and the rainfall so small, that even ragi requires to be regularly irrigated from wells. There are, altogether, 1795 tanks in the District, a comparatively small number for a District in Mysore. Irrigation is the great want of Chitaldrug; without water\nevery crop is precarious. Since the beginning of the century, a project has been under consideration for embanking the Vedavati river, where it breaks through the central range of the District. The cost is estimated at \u00a3150,000; and 50,000 acres in the fertile but unwatered plain of Hiri\u00fd\u00far would thus be rendered productive. The following irrigation works have been recently constructed\u2014Dodderi tank feeder, at a cost of \u00a33118, completed in 1881; and the Y\u00e1lluk tank feeder, completed in 1878 at a cost of \u00a31701. Out of the total area of 4871 square miles, 1256 are returned as under cultivation, 1761 as cultivable, and 1854 as uncultivable. The area under rice is 19,017 acres; wheat, 7573; other food-grains, 612,558; oil-seeds, 13,398; cotton, 16,365; vegetables, 1579; cocoa-nut palms, 8270 acres; areca-nut palms, 4034; sugar-cane, 2058 acres. The returns of agricultural stock show 5841 carts and 54,079 ploughs. But the chief wealth of Chitaldr\u00fag District consists in its flocks and herds. The common cattle of the villagers are of a small size; but on the wide pasture-grounds belonging to the amrit mah\u00e1l, or department for the improvement of cattle breeds, graze some of the largest and finest cattle in Southern India. The best cows and buffaloes are bred in the neighbourhood of Chitaldr\u00fag town. The most valuable breeds of sheep, on the other hand, are to be found in the north-west of the District. The total number of cows and bullocks is returned at 213,090; of buffaloes, at 54,548; of sheep and goats, at 284,600.\n\nManufactures, etc.\u2014The staple industries depend upon the local productions of cotton, wool, and iron. The weaving of coarse cotton cloth is carried on in all parts of the District, and several villages are known for the special fineness or peculiar pattern of their work. Kamblis, or woollen blankets, are also made everywhere, both white and black, as well as checked. The size is generally 18 feet long by 6 feet wide, and the price varies from 32s. to \u00a34. Some are occasionally produced of so delicate a texture that it is said they can be rolled up into a hollow bamboo, and \u00a330 is asked for such a fancy article. The weaving of silk is confined to a few localities. Iron-ore is largely smelted in the central hill ranges; the articles produced are agricultural implements and weapons of steel. The manufacture of glass ornaments, such as bangles, forms a speciality of the village of Mattod, in the Harihar taluk, and in Maleben\u00far in the D\u00e1vangere taluk. Coarse paper is made from old sacking in the Dodderi taluk; but both the glass and paper industries have fallen much off in recent years.\n\nThe principal centre of trade is the thriving town of D\u00e1vangere, in the north-west of the District, where a large through traffic is conducted. The areca-nut and pepper of the Maln\u00e1d or hill country of West Mysore are here exchanged for the piece-goods, hardware, salt, etc., imported from Madras, and the kamblis manufactured in the neigh-\nbourhood. The merchants mostly belong to the Lingayat sect. The most frequented religious fair is held at the sacred village of Nayakanhatti, in the Dodderi taluk, where 15,000 persons assemble annually. Other religious festivals are held at the following places:\u2014Kotegudda, Kalledevarpura, Hiriyur, Maildevapura, Nagalmadike, Murgi, and Gurusiddapura. Weekly fairs take place at Davangere, Nayakanhatti, Harihar, Budihal, and Huliyar. There are no railroads in the District. The imperial roads have a total length of 191 miles, maintained at an annual cost of \u00a33403; of District roads, there are 224 miles, which cost annually \u00a31616. First-class dak bungalows for the use of travellers are established at Bommankere, Chitaldrug, Harihar, and Hiriyur.\n\nAdministration.\u2014In 1881-82, the total revenue of Chitaldrug District, excluding forests, education, and public works, amounted to \u00a379,767. The chief items were\u2014land revenue, \u00a358,402; excise, \u00a36171; mohtarfa or assessed taxes, \u00a34124. The District is divided into 8 taluks or fiscal divisions, with 51 hoblis or minor fiscal units. In 1881-82, the total number of estates on the register was 77,811, owned by 66,349 proprietors or coparceners. During 1874, the average daily population of the District jail amounted to 27\u00b782, and of the taluk lock-ups to 11\u00b768; total, 39\u00b750 (of whom 3\u00b730 were women), showing 1 person in jail to every 13,855 of the population. In 1880, the District police force numbered 48 officers and 540 constables; total, 588 men of all ranks, maintained at an aggregate cost of \u00a33392. These figures show one policeman to every 7 square miles of area, or to every 639 persons of the population; the cost being 2\u00bdd. per head of population. The number of schools aided and inspected by Government in 1874 was 296, attended by 5847 pupils. In addition, there were 221 unaided schools, with 2831 pupils. In 1881, the Census Report returned 7134 boys and 167 girls as under instruction; besides 14,843 males and 173 females able to read and write, but not under instruction.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate of Chitaldrug is characterized by a drier heat than the rest of Mysore. The rainfall is considerably less, and there are few forests or inequalities of surface to moderate the radiation from the bare plain. In the western part, a cool breeze from the west sometimes blows at night in the hot season. The mean average temperature during the year is about 78\u00b71\u00b0 F., the hottest month being April. The average rainfall at Chitaldrug town, calculated on the twelve years ending 1881, amounts to only 25\u00b732 inches. Nearly one-half of this falls in the single month of October, at the season of the breaking of the north-east monsoon. Certain parts of the District, including the Hiriyur and Dodderi taluks, receive less than 10 inches in the year; and if this supply fails, severe distress is inevitably occasioned.\n\nThe vital statistics of the District are far from trustworthy; but it may\nbe mentioned that out of the total of 6134 deaths reported in 1881, 3981 were assigned to fevers, 346 to bowel complaints, 41 to small-pox, and 28 to snake-bite and wild beasts. As throughout the greater part of Mysore, outbreaks of cholera are rare. In 1880, the hospital and dispensary at Chitaldrug town afforded aid to 8362 persons. [For further information regarding Chitaldrug District, see the Gazetteer of Mysore and Coorg, by L. Rice, Esq., vol. ii. pp. 450\u2013504 (Bangalore, 1876); also the Census Report of Mysore, 1881; and the Administration Reports for 1880 to 1883.]\n\nChitaldrug.\u2014Taluk in Chitaldrug District, Mysore State. Area, 619 square miles; land revenue (1881\u201382), exclusive of water-rates, \u00a38124. A range of hills running north and south divides the taluk into two almost equal portions. In the southern portion, the hills are bold and striking. The western part of the taluk is best supplied with water, and contains the Bhimasamudra tank, 3\u00bd miles long by 2 miles broad. Population (1881) 51,689, namely, males 25,888, females 25,881. The Hindus number 49,168; Muhammadans, 2457; Christians, 64. The taluk contains (1883\u201384) 2 criminal courts; number of police stations (thana), 11; regular police, 107 men; village watchmen, 2707.\n\nChitaldrug ('Spotted castle,' or 'Umbrella rock').\u2014Chief town of the District of Chitaldrug, Mysore State; 126 miles north-west of Bangalore. Lat. 14\u00b0 14' N., long. 76\u00b0 26' E. Population (1881) 4271. The modern town stands at the north-east base of a cluster of hills, covered with extensive fortifications. Many inscriptions have been found of the Chalukya, Ballala, and Vijayanagar dynasties. Local history commences with the family of the Chitaldrug palegars, who trace back to the 15th century. Their hereditary title was Nayak, and they claimed descent from the Bedar or Boya caste of hunters and mountaineers. They gradually extended their power on all sides until they came into collision with Haidar Ali, who captured Chitaldrug in 1779, sent the last of the Nayaks prisoner to Seringapatam, and dispersed the Bedar population. The remains of the mud fort and palace of the palegars are still to be seen. Haidar Ali erected a formidable stone fortress, within which his son Tipu built a palace, now used as a court-house. In the city were also constructed immense granaries and pits, for storing oil and gh\u00ee. Inside the fortifications are 14 temples, of which the principal, dedicated to Huchangi-amma, has two storeys. Water is conducted to all the streets from the Timmalnayakan tank. The cantonments have been abandoned as a station for British troops, on account of their unhealthiness. The weavers of Chitaldrug were once celebrated, but only country blankets and coarse cotton cloth are now made. In the neighbourhood of the town are several maths or Hindu monasteries. The largest is the Murgi math, 3 miles to the\nnorth-west, the residence of the chief guru or spiritual leader of the Sivabhakts or Sivach\u00e1rs.\n\n**Chitalm\u00e1ri.**\u2014Village in Khuln\u00e1 District, Bengal; situated on the banks of the Madhumat\u00ed. The site of an annual fair held at the end of March, lasting six days, and attended by about 4000 people daily.\n\n**Chitang.**\u2014River in Amb\u00e1l\u00e1 (Umballa) and Karn\u00e1l Districts, Punjab; rises in the plains a few miles south of the Saraswati (Sursati), with which it runs parallel for a distance. Near B\u00e1lchaffar the two rivers apparently unite in the sands, but reappear in two distinct channels farther down, the Chitang running parallel with the Jumna (Jamun\u00e1), and then turning westward towards H\u00e1nsi and Hiss\u00e1r. The bed in this part of its course affords a channel for the Hiss\u00e1r branch of the Western Jumna Canal. Traces of the deserted waterway are visible as far as the Ghaggar, which it formerly joined some miles below Bhatner; but the stream is now entirely diverted into the canal. In former days it lost itself in the sand, like others of the smaller Cis-Sutlej rivers. Some authorities consider that the Chitang is an artificial channel. Cultivation extends along its banks in a few isolated patches, but for the most part a fringe of dense jungle lines its course.\n\n**Ch\u00edt\u00e1 Rew\u00e1.**\u2014River of the Central Provinces, rising in Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 District, and after a course of over 50 miles, falling into the Shakar, about a mile above the railway bridge at P\u00e1tlon in Narsinghpur District. The coal, worked by the Narbad\u00e1 (Nerbudda) Mining Company, appears in the gorge through which this river leaves the S\u00e1tpura table-land.\n\n**Chitarkot.**\u2014Hill and place of pilgrimage in B\u00e1n\u00e1da District, North-Western Provinces; distant 71 miles from Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d, and 42 miles from B\u00e1n\u00e1da. The P\u00e1suni river flows beneath its base, which has a circumference of some 3 miles. A terrace runs round the hill-side, upon which pilgrims perform the ceremony of circumambulation. In former times, the hill was more frequented as a place of pilgrimage than any other in Bundelkhand or Baghelkhand. It is said to have attained its great sanctity in the Treta-yug, or the third of the Hindu ages of the world, when it was visited by R\u00e1ma during his wanderings in the jungles. Thirty-three shrines, dedicated to various deities, crown the surrounding hills or fringe the banks of the P\u00e1suni. The temple attendants hold the revenues of 39 villages within British territory, besides several others in the adjoining Native States. Two large fairs take place annually, on the occasion of the R\u00e1m-n\u00e1m\u00ed and Diw\u00e1li festivals, which formerly attracted from 30,000 to 45,000 visitors, but not more than 15,000 now attend. The alleged causes of the falling off are that R\u00e1j\u00e1s do not attend the festivals in such number, or so frequently, as heretofore; and also that the Peshw\u00e1\u2019s family at\nKarwi, which was among its chief patrons, has become impoverished. Thirty gh\u0101ts, or bathing-places, along the banks of the river are held by Br\u0101hma\u1e47 families, who levy dues upon the pilgrims. Tradition sets down the total number of religious buildings at 360, a sacred number of constant occurrence throughout Upper India.\n\n**Chitartal\u0101.**\u2014River of Cuttack District, Orissa. A branch of the Mah\u0101n\u0101d\u012b, which leaves the parent stream about 10 miles below the point where it throws off the Birup\u0101. After flowing a few miles, the Chitartal\u0101 bifurcates into the Chitartal\u0101 and the N\u016bn. These streams re-unite after a course of about 20 miles; and under the name of the N\u016bn, the united waters fall into the Mah\u0101nad\u012b estuary a few miles from the coast, and so into the Bay of Bengal. The Kendrap\u0101r\u0101 Canal runs along the north bank of the Chitartal\u0101 to the point where the N\u016bn diverges to the northwards, whence it proceeds along the bank of the latter river till it drops into tidal waters at M\u0101rs\u0101gh\u0101i, after a total length of 42\u00bd miles from Cuttack.\n\n**Chit-Firozpur.**\u2014Town in Ballia District, North-Western Provinces. \u2014See Baragaon.\n\n**Chitor.**\u2014Town in Udaipur (Oodeypore) Native State, R\u0101jput\u0101na. Lat. (according to Thornton), 24\u00b0 52' N., long. 74\u00b0 41' E. Population (1881) 6931, namely, Hindus, 5736; and Muhammadans, 1195. The town is situated on the Nimach and Nasirabad road, 30 miles from the former and 114 from the latter, and a station of the Holkar and Sindhia-Nimach State Railway. It lies immediately at the foot of the western slope of the hill, on which is situated the celebrated fort called Chitorgarh. The town is nearly rectangular in form, and is defended by a wall connected with the fort. The Gameri, an affluent of the Berach, flows to the west, at a distance of 680 yards, and is spanned by a very solid old masonry bridge of 9 arches, in good order, but without parapets. The fort, Chitorgarh, stands on a long narrow hill, lying almost exactly north and south. Its area is 693 acres; extreme length from wall to wall 5735 yards, and greatest width 836 yards; total length of the ramparts 12,113 yards. The nature of the hill itself is solid rock, gradually sloping upwards from the plain, and more or less precipitous throughout the whole extent at the top; the stratification is nearly horizontal; but the dip is from the east and west towards the centre, and this form has been taken advantage of in forming tanks, of which there are 5 large ones in the southern half of the fort. At the extreme south end is a small round hill known as Chitoria, connected with the main hill by a saddle-back; the distance between the edge of this hill and the southern bastion is 150 yards, but the fort wall is 150 feet above it. The general level of the country is little more than 1300 feet above the sea. The height of the extreme northern end of the fort-wall is 1761 feet, and of the extreme southern point 1819 feet. Of the three approaches to the\nthree main gates of the fort, the principal, from the city on the west, ascends the hill gradually in a northern direction for about 1080 yards, passing under two gateways; the road then zig-zags for some 500 yards more, passing under three more gateways, before it arrives at the main gate of the fortress, known as the R\u00e1m Pol. The total length of the ascent is 1595 yards, and the slope, which is nearly uniform throughout, is about 1 in 15; the whole roadway is roughly paved. The second gate, known as the Lakola, is at the extreme northern point of the fort, and the ascent to it is by a small rugged pathway, little used. On the eastern face is the third entrance, known as the S\u00faraj Pol; the ascent to it is about 750 yards in length, the latter half being paved. There is an abundant supply of water inside the fort from tanks, 32 in number; and there is also a perennial spring from the lower part of the precipice over the city, which appears to be excellent drinking water. Though the soil inside the walls is very rocky, a great portion of the northern half produces annual crops of jo\u00e1r. In the centre are a few wheat-fields irrigated from the tanks, but to the south it is quite uncultivated. Little of pasturage is to be found inside the walls. As a fortress the place possesses great advantages; the hill itself, averaging about 450 feet above the surrounding country, precipitous at the top, and the whole covered with dense dha\u00f3 jungle, forms in itself no slight obstacle; and there is no commanding position within the range of even modern artillery. This ancient fortress was the capital of the country from A.D. 728, when Bapa R\u00e1wal, according to tradition, wrested it from the then reigning chief, till 1568, when it was finally deserted on its storm and capture by the Emperor Akbar.\n\nThe oldest monument now standing is the Khowasin Sthamba, a remarkable square pillar 75\u00bd feet in height, 30 feet in diameter at the base, and 15 feet at the top, and covered with Jain figures. Tod mentions a fragment of an inscription at its base bearing date A.D. 896; and it may be accepted as the work of the 10th century. There are also many Jain inscriptions still extant; but the oldest noted by Tod was dated 755. The entire top of the hill is covered with the ruins of temples, palaces, and reservoirs, all fully described by Tod. The chief object of interest is the Khirat Kh\u00famb, the pillar erected in 1450 by R\u00e1n\u00e1 Kh\u00fambhu, to commemorate his defeat of the combined armies of M\u00e1lw\u00e1 and Gujar\u00e1t in 1439. This column is 122 feet in height; the breadth of each face at the base is 35 feet, and at the summit, immediately under the cupola, 17\u00bd feet. It stands on a terrace, 42 feet square, and has 9 distinct storeys, with openings at every face of each storey. It is built chiefly of compact limestone and the quartz rock on which it stands, and the whole is covered with architectural ornaments and sculpture representing an immense variety of mythological subjects.\nChitr\u00e1 ('The Variegated', or 'Glancing Waters').\u2014River in Jessor District, Bengal. In Rennel's Bengal Atlas, of the last century, this river appears as an offshoot of the Nab\u00e1gang\u00e1, at a point 3 miles from where the latter river left the M\u00e1t\u00e1bh\u00e1ng\u00e1. At the present day, however, the head of the Chitr\u00e1 is completely closed, partly by the silting up of the Nab\u00e1gang\u00e1, and partly by an artificial disconnection with it, by means of an embankment which an indigo planter threw across the head of the Chitr\u00e1 about forty-five years ago. The river flows through Jessor in a south-south-easterly direction, past K\u00e1l\u00edganj, Khajur\u00e1, Ghor\u00e1khl\u00ed, Nar\u00e1l, and Gobr\u00e1, till it loses itself in the low marshy country in the interior of the District. Navigable in a portion of its course by boats of about 2 tons burthen from the commencement of the rains up to December, but before the end of February closed to all but the smallest craft.\n\nChitr\u00e1l.\u2014The capital of a State of the same name in the Kunar or K\u00e1shk\u00e1r valley, Kashmir. Lat. 35\u00b0 55' N., long. 71\u00b0 56' E.; elevation, 5200 feet; 48 miles south-west from Mastuj, on the K\u00e1shk\u00e1r river. The soil of the valley is fertile, producing much grain and quantities of many European fruits, as well as excellent grapes. According to tradition, Chitr\u00e1l was the wine cellar of Afrasi\u00e1b. The valley resembles K\u00e1f\u00e1rist\u00e1n in physical features and coldness of climate. The men of the valley are tall and well-made, and the women remarkable for their beauty, bearing a strong resemblance in their physiognomy and colour to the hill people of Chamba and K\u00e1ngra. Slavery is common, and the slave trade forms one of the principal items of revenue of the Chitr\u00e1l rulers. Trade is carried on chiefly by barter. Caravans of petty merchants pass through Chitr\u00e1l annually between Pesh\u00e1war, Panjkora, Sw\u00e1t, and Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d on the south, and Badaksh\u00e1n K\u00fanduz, Balkh, T\u00farkist\u00e1n, Kolab, and Y\u00e1rkand on the north. Very few but Afghans trade between Y\u00e1rkand and Pesh\u00e1war. The Chitr\u00e1l State owns the supremacy of Kashm\u00edr.\n\nChitr\u00e1vati.\u2014River in Cuddapah (Kadapa) District, Madras Presidency. It rises at Nandidr\u00fag in Mysore, and, flowing across Bellary District, joins the Penn\u00e1r in the Jamalamadugu t\u00e1luk.\n\nChitr\u00e1w\u00e1o.\u2014Petty State of Gohelw\u00e1r District, K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay Presidency. Consists of 1 village, with 1 independent tribute-payer. Estimated revenue in 1881, \u00a3160. Pays tribute of \u00a349 to the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda, and \u00a33, 16s. to Jun\u00e1garh.\n\nChittagong.\u2014Division or Commissionership of Bengal, lying between 20\u00b0 45' and 24\u00b0 16' N. lat., and between 90\u00b0 32' and 92\u00b0 44' E. long.; comprising the Districts of CHITTAGONG, NOAKHALI, TIPPERAH, and the CHITTAGONG HILL TRACTS. Bounded on the north by the Hill Tipperah State; on the east by the hilly tract inhabited by Lush\u00e1\u00eds and other half-savage tribes; on the south by Akyab District in British\nBurma; and on the west by the Bay of Bengal and the Meghna estuary. Area, 12,118 square miles; number of towns and villages, 11,113; number of occupied houses, 492,722. Total population (1881) 3,574,048. namely, males 1,774,336, and females 1,799,712; average density of population, 295 persons per square mile; villages per square mile, '92; houses per square mile, 42'10; persons per village, 322; persons per occupied house, 7'25. Divided according to religion, Muhammadans number 2,425,610; Hindus, 1,017,963; Buddhists, 128,568; Christians, 1891; Sikhs, 5; Br\u00e1hmos, 8; and 'others,' 3. Approximate land revenue, \u00a3290,654.\n\nChittagong.\u2014District in the Lieutenant-Governorship of Bengal, lying between 20\u00b0 45' and 22\u00b0 59' N. lat., and between 91\u00b0 30' and 92\u00b0 25' E. long. Area, 2567 square miles; population, according to the Census of 1881, 1,132,341. Bounded on the north-west and north by the river Phen\u00ed, which separates it from the British Districts of No\u00e1kh\u00e1l\u00ed and Tipperah, and from the semi-independent State of Hill Tipperah; on the east by the Hill Tracts of Chittagong and the Arakan Province of British Burma, the river N\u00e1f forming the frontier; and on the west by the Bay of Bengal. The chief town and administrative head-quarters is CHITTAGONG or Isl\u00e1m\u00e1b\u00e1d.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014Chittagong District consists of a long and narrow strip of coast, backed by low ranges of hills, lying between the Bay of Bengal and the Chittagong and Arakan Hill Tracts. Its length is about 165 miles, and its average breadth about 15 miles. The low ranges of hills run, through the greater part of their length, almost parallel with each other, and with the coast-line. The level strip of land between the coast and the first of these ranges is intersected by numerous large tidal creeks, especially an alluvial tract in the central portion of the District opposite the islands of Maheshkh\u00e1l and Kutabd\u00eda, which in character and general appearance greatly resembles the Gangetic SUNDARBANS. These creeks are navigable, but are not used to any great extent for purposes of commerce; and in the Sundarban tract alluded to, they are silting up at their mouths. New land is thus constantly being formed, which soon becomes covered with mangrove, scrub, and palms. The principal rivers of the District are the Karnaphuli and the Sangu, both of which are navigable throughout the year. The Phen\u00ed, which forms the boundary between Chittagong and No\u00e1kh\u00e1l\u00ed, can hardly be called a river of the District, and nowhere intersects it. The Karnaphuli rises in the north-east of the Chittagong Hill Tracts, and, after a very tortuous westerly and south-westerly course through Chittagong, falls into the Bay of Bengal. Chittagong town and port are situated on the north bank of this river, about 12 miles from its mouth. Up to this point it is navigable by large sea-going ships and steamers, and throughout its entire course in the District by large\ncargo boats. The principal tributary of the Karnaphuli is the Hald\u00e1. The Sangu, which takes its rise in the south-eastern corner of the Arakan Hill Tracts, also follows a very circuitous course, and finally enters the Bay of Bengal 10 miles south of the Karnaphuli. It is navigable by large cargo boats for a distance of 30 miles throughout the year, and its chief tributary, the Dolu, for 7 miles all the year round, and 14 miles in the rainy season. Smaller streams and watercourses, navigable throughout the rainy season by small native boats, intersect the District in all directions. A considerable portion of the low-lying tract of Chittagong is protected by embankments from the sea. The principal of these embankments are those in the island of Kutabdi\u00e1, and the Gand\u00e1m\u00e1ra dykes built to protect the village of Gand\u00e1m\u00e1ra. Most of the embankments, including those just named, were for some time abandoned by Government, and destroyed by the sea. They have been recently reconstructed. There are five principal hill ranges in the District\u2014namely (1) the Sit\u00e1kund; (2) the Goli\u00e1s\u00ed; (3) the S\u00e1tk\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1; (4) the M\u00e1skh\u00e1l; and (5) the Tekn\u00e1f range. Of these, the most interesting is the first-named, which contains the sacred peak of Chandran\u00e1th or Sit\u00e1kund, 1155 feet in height, the highest hill in the District. There are no lakes in Chittagong District. The canals or artificial watercourses consist of a line of re-opened creeks in the coast tract, solely used for navigation. One of these canals or creeks commences on the coast 12 miles north of the mouth of the Karnaphuli, and falls into that river just below Chittagong town; the others form a line of communication between the Karnaphuli river and the sea at Jalkadar opposite Kutabdi\u00e1 island. They are leased out annually under the Canal Tolls Act to farmers who levy a fixed rate of toll. These creeks are very important, and the line formed by them is one of the great highways of the District. Numerous ferries are established across the principal rivers and streams, the tolls of which, with one or two exceptions, are leased out annually in the same manner as the canals. Most of the villages possess water communication; and nearly every inhabitant of the District may be said to live more or less by river traffic. Grain, cotton, pottery, firewood, dried fish, and bamboos form the chief articles of local river trade. The sea and river fisheries are very valuable, and form a means of livelihood to a large section of the population. The chief localities for inland fisheries are the rivers Karnaphuli, Sangu, Hald\u00e1, and Ch\u00e1ndkh\u00e1l\u00ed; but the sea-coast fishery at Son\u00e1di\u00e1 and K\u00e1l\u00ed Daha is the most extensive. The dried fish are principally sent to Chittagong town; but with the exception of sharks' fins, which are exported to Rangoon, there is no exportation of fish from the District. The jungle products consist of reeds, canes, and bamboos, mostly brought from the valleys in the hill ranges, where the hill slopes\nafford abundant pasturage for cattle. No coal or minerals are known to exist in Chittagong. A hot spring on the sacred hill of Sitakund is a great place of pilgrimage, and is visited by pious Hindus from all parts of India. There is also a salt-spring, known by the name of Labanakhya, situated about 3 miles north of the Sitakund, which is also reputed to be of great sanctity, and is visited by large numbers of pilgrims. The wild animals of the District consist of the tiger, elephant, rhinoceros, leopard, wild boar, and deer. There is a considerable export trade in king-fisher skins to Burma and China.\n\nHistory.\u2014Chittagong originally formed part of the extensive Hindu kingdom of Tipperah; but, prior to its conquest by the Muhammadans, it had frequently changed masters. Lying on the frontier between Bengal and Burma, it formed a source of chronic feud between the Hindu King of Tipperah and the Buddhist King of Arakan. The District was probably first conquered by the Muhammadans during the period of Afghan supremacy in Bengal, between the 13th and 16th centuries. The Portuguese historian, Faria de Souza, states that, in 1538, the Viceroy of Goa despatched an envoy to the Afghan King of Bengal, who landed at Chittagong, and proceeded thence to the capital at Gaur. The king, however, being suspicious of the intentions of the Portuguese, seized thirteen members of the embassy at Gaur, together with their ship's company. In revenge for this outrage, the Portuguese, some months afterwards, burned Chittagong. During the struggle between the Mughals and Afghans for the supremacy in Bengal, towards the close of the 16th century, Chittagong seems to have been reconquered by the Raj\u00e1 of Arakan, and annexed to his kingdom as a tributary Province; this reconquest, however, was ignored by the Mughals, after the final expulsion of the Afghans from Bengal. Todar Mall, Akbar's finance minister, continued to treat the District as an integral part of the Muhammadan dominions; and, in 1582, fixed its assessment on the rent-roll of the Empire 'by estimation' at \u00a328,560. As a matter of fact, Chittagong was then a Province of Arakan, and remained so until 1666, when it was reannexed to the Mughal Empire. In 1638, Matak Rai, a Magh chief, held Chittagong on behalf of the Arakan Raj\u00e1; but, having displeased his prince, and fearing punishment, he sought the protection of the Mughals, acknowledged himself a vassal of the Delhi Empire, and nominally made over the sovereignty of his territory to the Governor of Bengal. Soon after this, the depredations of the Arakanese became intolerable. For many years they had been making piratical incursions into the Muhammadan territory, penetrating far up the rivers of Bengal, and carrying into slavery the inhabitants of all the river-side villages. The Maghs were aided by numbers of half-caste Portuguese adventurers, retained in the employ of the Raj\u00e1 of Arakan. To such an extent\nwere these depredations carried, that in a map of Bengal by Major J. Rennel, Surveyor-General, published in 1794, a note is entered across the portion of the Sundarbans, immediately south of B\u00e1karganj town, that 'this part of the country has been deserted on account of the ravages of the Muggs.' It is, however, probable that only a portion of the deserted tract was laid waste by the Maghs, and that the true cause of the desolation is the change which has taken place in the river system of the delta.\n\nIn 1664-65, Sh\u00e1\u00edst\u00e1 Kh\u00e1n, then Governor of Bengal, resolved to put an end to these piratical incursions, and for that purpose undertook an expedition against the Arakan R\u00e1j\u00e1 on such a scale as would secure the permanent conquest of Chittagong. He accordingly assembled a powerful fleet of boats, and an army 13,000 strong. Of this force, 3000 were despatched in the fleet, under the command of an officer named Husain Beg, with orders to clear the rivers and islands of the pirates. The remaining force was placed under the command of his son Buzurg Umed Kh\u00e1n, with instructions to proceed by land and co-operate with the fleet. The expedition was a complete success. The ports at the mouth of the Meghn\u00e1, and Sandw\u00edp island, were captured by the fleet. The Portuguese auxiliaries to the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Arakan having been invited to assist the Mughals\u2014under a threat from the general that if they failed he would, on the capture of Chittagong, put them to the sword\u2014deserted the R\u00e1j\u00e1's service, and sailed for Sandw\u00edp, where they were received by the Imperial general, and a residence assigned to them 12 miles below Dacca. The army under Umed Kh\u00e1n advanced by land, and after defeating the Arakanese in various encounters, finally carried the town of Chittagong by storm, which was thereupon re-annexed to Bengal, and its name changed to Isl\u00e1m\u00e1b\u00e1d, the Residence of the Faithful.\n\nTwenty years after the occurrence of these events (1685), the first connection of the English with Chittagong took place. In that year, the East India Company, in consequence of disputes with the Naw\u00e1b of Bengal, sent out an expedition under Admiral Nicholson, with instructions to seize Chittagong and fortify it on behalf of the English. Owing to circumstances which occurred at H\u00fagli (see Hugli District), the Admiral never proceeded to Chittagong, and the District did not pass into our possession until 1760, when it was ceded to the East India Company, along with Bardw\u00e1n and Midnapur, by M\u00edr K\u00e1s\u00edm. The administration of Chittagong was at once placed in the hands of an English 'Chief' with a Council, and the District soon settled down into a well-regulated English Province. Immediately after the annexation of Arakan by the King of Burma, a large immigration of Maghs took place into Chittagong, caused by the oppressions and exactions to which they were subjected by the Burmese Government. To this\nimmigration the first Burmese War may be indirectly traced. The Viceroy of Arakan despatched a military force to compel the return of the emigrants; and, although this force was withdrawn for other and more pressing needs elsewhere, aggressions on the frontier continued, which culminated in the forcible seizure of the island of Sh\u00e1hp\u00fari at the mouth of the N\u00e1f river, which had been many years in the undisputed occupation of the British. In the war of 1824 which ensued, a strong Burmese force, 8000 strong, marching on Chittagong, surrounded and annihilated a British detachment of about 300 Sepoys and 2 guns at R\u00e1mu, a frontier village to the south. Before the Burmese commander could follow up his success, the setting in of the rains rendered the roads impassable; and soon afterwards, on the capture of Rangoon, the Arakan force was recalled.\n\nThe only event of any importance in the recent history of the District was in connection with the Mutiny of 1857. In that year, the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Companies of the 34th Native Infantry, stationed at Chittagong, suddenly broke into mutiny on the night of the 18th November, plundered the treasury, released the prisoners in the jail, and murdered a native constable, but abstained from molesting their inhabitants, and took their way into Hill Tipperah. They were promptly pursued, and broken up; the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Hill Tipperah and the hillmen arrested all stragglers, and sent them in to the British authorities. Since 1857, nothing has occurred to disturb the peace and good order of the District.\n\nPopulation.\u2014Prior to 1872, no systematic attempt was made to enumerate the population of Chittagong. In that year, the population over an area corresponding to the present limits of the District (i.e. allowing for transfers to and from neighbouring Districts), was returned at 1,127,402 souls. By the last Census of 1881, the number was returned at 1,132,341, or an increase of only 4939, or less than one-half per cent. The population of the District may be said to be now stationary, and indeed the males show an actual falling off of 82 per cent. It must be remembered, however, that cholera is endemic in the District, that a peculiarly fatal and debilitating fever has raged for years, and that great loss of life was caused in the seaboard tracts by the cyclone of the 31st October 1876. Moreover, the cheapness of land and the high wages of labour in Arakan attract many settlers every year from Chittagong. Area of District, 2567 square miles; number of towns and villages, 1376; number of houses, 218,705, of which 211,387 were occupied and 7318 unoccupied; average density of population, 441\u00b711 persons per square mile; towns and villages, 54 per square mile; houses per square mile, 85\u00b720; persons per village, 823; persons per occupied house, 5\u00b736. Classified according to sex there were\u2014males, 531,649, and females, 600,692; proportion of males, 46\u00b79 per cent. of the total population.\nThe excess of the female over the male population of Chittagong is attributed to the fact, that the District supplies laskars or native sailors for vessels trading in Indian waters, and also sends a number of labourers to Arakan in the cold season, during which the Census was taken. Classified according to religion, there were\u2014Muhammadans, 801,986, or 70\u00b782 per cent. of the population; Hindus, 275,177, or 24\u00b728 per cent.; Buddhists, 54,110, or 4\u00b777 per cent.; Christians, 1055; Sikhs, 5; and Br\u00e1hmos, 8. The aboriginal tribes numbered 1356 in 1881, most of whom are Nats or demon-worshippers, but they are returned in the above figures as Hindus by religion. Among the high Hindu castes Br\u00e1hmans numbered 21,355, and R\u00e1jputs 1040. Among the other castes the most numerous are the following:\u2014Baniy\u00e1, 8030; B\u00e1ru\u00ed, 4766; Dhobi, 11,446; Jaliy\u00e1, 15,312; Jugi, 27,351; Kaibartta, 4542; K\u00e1yasth, the most numerous caste in the District, 72,370; Kumbhar, 5095; N\u00e1pit, 15,382; S\u00fadra, 29,334; and T\u00e1nti, 5248. The Muhammadan community is divided according to sect into Sunnis, 797,452; Shi\u00e1s, 3569; and unspecified, 965. Of the Christian population, 211 are Europeans; the great majority of the remainder being Firingh\u00eds, the descendants of the early Portuguese adventurers who played such an important part in the history of Chittagong two centuries ago. At one time they were extensive shipowners and wealthy men, but they are now fast decreasing in importance. In the interior, a few of them follow agricultural pursuits; but for the most part they reside in Chittagong town. Even as late as the beginning of the present century, the Firingh\u00eds possessed large numbers of slaves, often exceeding 50 in one family. The process of miscegenation which has been long going on has completely deprived the present descendants of the Portuguese of any resemblance to their ancestors; and except by their dress, they are hardly distinguishable in appearance from the natives. By neglect of education, the Firingh\u00eds have allowed the natives to outstrip them, and many appointments, of which they had formerly the monopoly, are now held by Hindus and Muhammadans.\n\nTown and Rural Population.\u2014The population is altogether rural; and, with the exception of the municipality of Chittagong, there is no town containing more than 5000 inhabitants. The population of CHITTAGONG Town is 20,969; Cox\u2019s BAZAR (population 4363) is the only other town of any importance in the District, and in it more than three-fourths of the population are Maghs. Of the 1376 villages and towns in the District, 356 contain less than two hundred inhabitants; 408 from two hundred to five hundred; 273 from five hundred to a thousand; 201 from one thousand to two thousand; 78 from two thousand to three thousand; 38 from three thousand to five thousand; 21 village unions (mauz\u00e1s) from five thousand to ten thousand; and\ntown (Chittagong) upwards of twenty thousand inhabitants. The principal villages are Phatikchari, Kumiri\u00e1, H\u00e1thaz\u00e1ri, R\u00e1oj\u00e1n, Pati\u00e1, S\u00e1tk\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1, Chandran\u00e1th (on S\u00edt\u00e1kund Hill, a much frequented place of pilgrimage), M\u00e1skh\u00e1l (in the island of the same name), Chakari\u00e1, and Ramu. Near R\u00e1j\u00e1kul, a village to the south of Ramu, are the remains of an old fort which, it is supposed, belonged to a Magh chieftain; but there are singularly few relics in the District suggestive of its historical importance.\n\nOccupations.\u2014The Census Report of 1881 divides the male population as regards occupation into the following six main classes:\u2014(1) Professional class, including all civil and military officials, and the learned professions, 10,905; (2) domestic servants, inn and lodging-house keepers, etc., 7522; (3) Commercial class, including bankers, merchants, traders, carriers, etc., 18,006; (4) agricultural and pastoral class, including gardeners, 142,267; (5) manufacturing and industrial class, including artisans, 34,014; (6) indefinite and non-productive, including male children, general labourers, and persons of unspecified occupation, 318,335.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Rice is the staple crop of Chittagong. There are three harvests in the year\u2014boro, or spring rice; \u00e1us, the autumn crop; and \u00e1man, or winter rice. These are further sub-divided into 33 principal varieties. Other crops are Indian corn, wheat, barley, peas, jute, flax, mustard, sugar-cane, p\u00e1n, cotton, tobacco, and tea. Of these the most important are the three last-named. An account of the cultivation of cotton and tobacco in the Hill Tracts will be found in the Statistical Account of Bengal, vol. vi. pp. 199\u2013207. The introduction of tea into the District dates from 1840, in which year some tea-seed was received from Assam and three China plants from Calcutta. Three years later, the first tea was manufactured in the District. According to the latest returns, the total cultivated area in Chittagong amounts to 544,640 acres, and the area cultivable but not cultivated to 21,120 acres. Almost the whole\u2014537,472 acres\u2014of the cultivated area is devoted to food-crops. The average produce per acre of rice is about 15 maunds or 11 cwts.; wheat, 11 cwts.; inferior grains, 12 cwts.; oil-seeds, 5\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) cwts.; tobacco, 7 cwts. The average rent for good land is about \u00a31. 2s. 6d. an acre; and for poor soil, about 12s. Rich alluvial land along the banks of rivers, suited to the cultivation of tobacco, p\u00e1n, and other special crops, is rented at much higher rates, the average being \u00a32, 2s. an acre. Wages have increased very considerably of late years. In 1850\u201351, day-labourers and ploughmen received 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)d. a day; in 1860\u201361, they earned from 3\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\)d. to 5\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\)d.; by 1870\u201371, the wage for the same class of labour had risen as high as 6d. and 7\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)d., and in 1882, 9d. and 1s. In the same way, smiths, bricklayers, and carpenters, who,\nin 1850-51, were paid 2\u00bdd. a day, earned in 1860-61, 4\u00bdd. to 6\u00bdd., and in 1870-71, 7\u00bdd. The average price of the best cleaned rice in 1870-71 was 6s. 10d. a cwt., and of coarse rice, 5s. The average price per cwt. of other produce was returned in the same year as follows:\u2014Wheat, 6s. 2d.; linseed, 6s.; jute, 8s. 2d.; cotton, \u00a31, 4s. 6d.; sugar, \u00a31, 15s. 6d.; salt, 15s. Manure is used to some extent in Chittagong, and irrigation is effected by means of the numerous watercourses. P\u0101n gardens are allowed to lie fallow for two years after three successive crops have been obtained. Sugar-cane is not grown two successive years on the same land. Chittagong is essentially a District of small estates. The peasantry, as a rule, are in good circumstances, seldom in debt, and very independent; many of them add to their income derived from agriculture, by working as labourers, boatmen, petty traders, etc. They are, however, of an exceedingly litigious and quarrelsome disposition, having recourse to the District Courts on the most frivolous pretext.\n\n**Natural Calamities.**\u2014Blight occur from time to time, but not to such an extent as to affect the general food-supply of the District. The lands along the coast are often flooded by the sea, and much injury is done, for the existing embankments do not afford adequate protection against the encroachments of the water. Chittagong is also exposed to storms, but serious injury is rare. A severe cyclone passed over the southern portion of the District in October 1872, causing considerable loss of life and destruction of property. The cyclone and storm-wave of the 31st October 1876 swept the seaboard with still more disastrous results. This last inundation extended inland for a distance of from three to six miles, except where the mouths of rivers and creeks afforded the storm-wave an easy entrance, and there the flood passed much farther up and spread over the country for miles. It is estimated that 12,000 persons were drowned in Chittagong alone, and 14,788 are said to have perished in the cholera epidemic which succeeded the inundation. Famine is unknown in the District, and could only result from a combination of extensive loss of local crops, with great scarcity in the Gangetic Delta and in Burma. Drought is almost unknown in the District, and no demand exists for any irrigation works. The maximum price of rice in 1866, the year of the great Orissa famine, was 13s. 8d. a cwt., and of unhusked paddy, 5s. 5d. a cwt.\n\n**Commerce, etc.**\u2014The chief imports into Chittagong are piece-goods, salt, and earth-oil, and the principal exports tea and jute, the latter being largely shipped from this port in preference to Calcutta. The District trade is virtually that of Chittagong town and port, and the statistics are given fully in the article on Chittagong town (post, p. 445). Besides the town and port of Chittagong, the chief seats of trade in the District are Cox\u2019s Bazar, Mah\u0101jan-h\u00e1t, N\u0101zir-h\u00e1t, and Ro\u00e1j\u00e1-h\u00e1t;\nbut nearly every village has a permanent h\u00e2t or market held twice a week.\n\nManufactures are not carried on to any great extent in the District. A little coarse cloth is woven from cotton, and common kinds of pottery and silver and gold ornaments of inferior workmanship are made. There are several steam rice husking mills; and ship-building is carried on. The carpenters are skilful, but a want of energy is observable in this industry. In 1881-82, there were in Chittagong 386 miles of road, maintained at a total cost of \u00a38969. There are several natural creeks, which furnish excellent means of communication. The more important of these have a total length of about 36 miles, and, together with the roads above mentioned, are kept up by the District Road Committee. These waterways are all under the Canal Tolls Act, and are let out to farmers, who levy a fixed toll. The Dacca Trunk Road, of which 45 miles lie within the District, is maintained by Government. Chittagong District will shortly be brought in connection with the regular railway system of India; surveys have been carried out for a line from Chittagong town to the Meghna at Da\u00fadkand\u00ed in No\u00e1kh\u00e1l\u00ed District, opposite Nara\u00ednganj in Dacca, a length of 128 miles. A ferry service between Da\u00fadkand\u00ed and Nara\u00ednganj will connect the Chittagong line with the Dacca-Maimansingh Railway now under construction. At Comilla in Tipperah District, the Chittagong line will connect the project with the projected railway northwards to Assam and Cachar.\n\nTea.\u2014Tea cultivation was introduced into the District in 1849, in which year some tea-seeds were received from Assam, and a few China plants from the Calcutta Botanical Gardens. Three years later, the first tea was manufactured in Chittagong. In the end of 1862, a single planter, who visited the District, took up 20,000 acres of land; after this, other speculators came forward, applications for allotments of waste lands poured in, and a number of gardens were started, many of which failed through the fault of the managers, or from unsuitable sites having been chosen. Most of the lands intended for tea-planting are held in fee-simple, having been purchased under the Waste-Land Rules. Rich land, with good drainage, is considered the best for the growth of tea; most of the suitable and accessible sites have been already taken up for cultivation. The number of plantations in 1872 was 13; the area under cultivation, 1203 acres; area taken up for planting, but not then planted, 23,687 acres. The approximate yield was 205,112 lbs., or an average of 198 lbs. per acre of mature plant. In 1868-69, the number of chests exported was 502, of about 86 lbs. each; estimated value, \u00a34016. In 1872-73, 3342 chests were exported, valued at \u00a329,977; in 1873-74, 4427 chests, valued at \u00a330,147. In 1881-82, 810,397 lbs. of tea were exported, of the value of \u00a365,117.\n\nAdministration.\u2014When Chittagong was ceded to the English in\n1760, it contained an area of 2987 square miles, and yielded (inclusive of grants for the maintenance of a military force) a revenue of Sikh\u00e1 Rs. 323,135. The earlier tables of revenue and expenditure contain so many items which are mere matters of account, transfer, and deposit, that they are useless for comparative purposes. In 1881\u201382, the net revenue of the District was \u00a3149,320. The land-tax forms the most important item of revenue. In 1790 there were only 3376 estates, and 5384 proprietors, paying a total land revenue of \u00a351,412, or \u00a315, 4s. 6\u00bdd. per estate. By 1850\u201351, the number of estates had risen to 40,764, and of proprietors to 61,040; land revenue, \u00a378,414; average per estate, \u00a31, 18s. 5\u00bdd. The number of estates paying rent to Government in 1870\u201371 was 29,408, and the number of proprietors or coparceners, 52,047; the average land revenue paid by each estate being \u00a32, 11s. 1\u00bdd., and the average paid by each proprietor, \u00a31, 8s. 10\u00bdd. The term \u2018estate,\u2019 however, is not always used in the same sense, and is sometimes made to include under tenures. In 1881\u201382, there were about 29,000 estates paying revenue to Government, and 5 kh\u00e1s mah\u00e1ls, or estates in which the Government is absolute proprietor, and collects the rent direct from the tenants. There were also nearly 36,000 rent-free properties. The revenue from the five Government estates in 1881\u201382 aggregated \u00a313,172, and from the 29,000 private estates, \u00a366,608; total, \u00a379,780. The rent-free properties pay only towards local rates, such as the Road Cess and the Postal Cess. A large special establishment is maintained for the purpose of inquiring into and registering all titles to land. The number of magisterial courts in 1880\u201381 was 10, and of civil and revenue courts, 13. For police purposes, the District is divided into 13 th\u00e1ns. The regular police force consisted in 1880\u201381 of 385 men of all ranks, maintained at a total cost of \u00a37227. There was also a municipal force of 61 men, costing \u00a3633, and a village police consisting of 2037 men, receiving \u00a39221 in money and lands. The total machinery, therefore, for the protection of person and property in the District consisted of 2483 officers and men, maintained at a total cost of \u00a317,081; giving one man to every 1 square mile, and for every 456 of the population. The District possesses a central jail at Chittagong, and a lock-up at Cox\u2019s B\u00e1z\u00e1r. The average daily number of prisoners in 1881 was 135. An English school was first established by Government in Chittagong in 1836, and in 1869 a high school (subsequently developed into a college) was opened in connection with it. The college department contained 17 pupils in 1882, and the collegiate school, 455 pupils. Since the introduction of the scheme for the encouragement of primary education, the number of Government and aided schools established up to March 1882 was 786, attended by 21,288 pupils. Apart from Government aid or inspection, Chittagong District stands exceptionally high in the general\ndiffusion of indigenous elementary education. For the special requirements of the Muhammadan community, a Madrasa has been established at Chittagong, maintained out of the proceeds of the Mohsin Endowment fund, a bequest made by a benevolent Muhammadan. The pupils numbered 314 in March 1882, of whom 28 were boarders. For administrative purposes, Chittagong is divided into two Sub-divisions. The fiscal sub-division into pargan\u00e1s has not been introduced into this District.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014Chittagong is very unhealthy. Every form of malarious disease is met with, intermittent fever being the most common. This fever seldom proves directly fatal; but its constant recurrence causes enlargement of the spleen and liver, anaemia, dropsy, and ultimately death from debility. The District is hardly ever entirely free from cholera. Amongst other causes to which the unhealthiness of Chittagong has been attributed, are the numerous tidal creeks and khals (which have been described as \u2018simply a series of open sewers, without the advantage of ever being well flushed\u2019), and the extraordinarily large number of tanks scattered over the lowlands, which are never cleaned, and are almost invariably choked with weeds and decaying vegetation. Chittagong town being open to the sea-breeze, which usually prevails during the day, is cool; but the atmosphere is often laden with moisture, and heavy night dews and occasional fogs are the result. Average annual temperature, $77^\\circ$ F. The average temperature in 1881 was $77^\\circ$, the highest maximum recorded being $92^\\circ$ in March, and the lowest minimum $47^\\circ$ in January. Average annual rainfall for twenty-five years ending 1881 was 103.58 inches. The rainfall in 1881 was 95.76 inches, or 7.82 inches below the average.

Cotton, Esq. (Calcutta, 1880); Census Report of Bengal for 1881; and the Annual Administration Reports for Bengal from 1880 to 1883.]\n\nChittagong.\u2014Head-quarters Sub-division of the District of same name, Bengal; lying between $21^\\circ 50'$ and $22^\\circ 59'$ N. lat., and between $91^\\circ 30'$ and $92^\\circ 14' 45\"$ E. long. Area, 1630 square miles, with 1101 villages and towns, and 181,415 occupied houses. Population (1881), namely, Muhammadans, 673,949; Hindus, 261,510; Buddhists, 34,480; Christians, 10,41; and \u2018others,\u2019 13: total, 970,993, being 454,401 males and 516,592 females. Average density of population, 596 persons per square mile; houses per square mile, 115; persons per village, 882; persons per house, 5.3. The Sub-division consists of the 9 police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s) of Chittagong, Kumiri\u00e1, Mirkasar\u00e1i, H\u00e1th\u00e1z\u00e1ri, Phatikchari, R\u00e1oj\u00e1n, Pati\u00e1, S\u00e1tk\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1, and Banskh\u00e1li. In 1883, it contained 13 civil and 6 criminal courts; strength of regular police, 335 men; village watchmen (chauk\u00edd\u00e1rs), 1802.\nChittagong.\u2014Chief town and administrative head-quarters of Chittagong District, and the second port in Bengal. Lat. 22\u00b0 21' 3\" N., long. 91\u00b0 52' 44\" E.; area, 9 square miles; population (1881) 20,969, namely, 14,478 Muhammadans, 5660 Hindus, and 831 'others.' Of the total population, 12,180 are males and only 8789 females, the excess of males being due to the fact that many men come into the town from other parts in search of employment, leaving their families at home. Chittagong is situated on the right bank of the Karnaphuli river, about 12 miles from its mouth. The town is merely an agglomeration of small villages grouped together for municipal purposes. The houses occupied by the European residents are scattered over a considerable area, each house on a separate hill. These hills, though small, are very steep, and, with one or two exceptions, it is impossible to drive to the top. The principal streets are Diw\u00e1n-b\u00e1z\u00e1r and its continuation Chandanpura-b\u00e1z\u00e1r, which run through the town from north to south. Besides the houses of the European and the principal native residents, the chief brick buildings are the Government offices, circuit house, and d\u00e1k bungalow, churches (Roman Catholic and Protestant), several large mosques, a home for European sailors, hotel, schools, and dispensary. The municipal income for the year 1881-82 was \u00a32,593; derived mainly from the house-tax; rate of taxation, 2s. per head.\n\nThe notorious unhealthiness of Chittagong is partly attributable to the existence of a large number of stagnant pools and tanks, from which malarious exhalations arise. Malaria is also carried by the prevalent wind (from the south or south-west) from the extensive chars, or marshy islands, which have been thrown up in the river opposite the town. Efforts are being made to improve the sanitary condition of the place.\n\nChittagong has long been an important place of trade, and the early Portuguese merchants gave it the name of Porto Grando. The establishment of the European settlements on the H\u00fagl\u00ed caused it to sink for a time into comparative insignificance. But of late it has gradually been resuming its place as a great centre of commerce; and the port, which is one of the best in India, is frequented by vessels from foreign countries as well as from the Indian Presidencies. Unfortunately it is comparatively inaccessible to native craft coming from Tipperah, No\u00e1kh\u00e1l\u00ed, Dacca, and B\u00e1karganj, which must, before entering the river, round a point where rough weather is often encountered. This risk they will not run, except during a short period from December to March, which covers most of the rice season, but does not allow of a traffic in oil-seed, jute, etc. As a remedy for this, a proposal is now (1883) before the Government of India for a line of railway from Chittagong to Da\u00fadkand\u00ed, in Tipperah District, with a ferry service to Nar\u00e1inganj, which will go far to make Chittagong the port for the trade\nof the whole of Eastern Bengal. The length of the line would be 128 miles, and the work presents no engineering difficulties.\n\nThe trade of the port is steadily increasing, and in 1881-82, both in regard to foreign and coasting trade, was larger than in any previous year. The number of vessels which entered the port in 1860-61 was 66\u2014tonnage, 9743; in 1865, the number of vessels was 221, with a tonnage of 44,282; in 1874-75, it was 220\u2014tonnage, 83,900. In 1860-61, 100 vessels cleared\u2014tonnage, 14,499; in 1865-66, the number of ships cleared was 247, with a tonnage of 47,905; 1874-75, it was 215, with a tonnage of 86,264. In 1881-82 no fewer than 771 seagoing vessels, with a tonnage of 191,540, entered; and 773 vessels, of a tonnage of 188,599, cleared from Chittagong port. As regards trade statistics, the merchandise imported into or exported from Chittagong by country boats during 1881-82 was\u2014imports, 1,736,408 cwts., value \u00a3471,861; and exports, 251,343 cwts., valued at \u00a3140,830. Total inland import and export trade in 1881-82, 1,987,751 cwts., valued at \u00a3612,692. As regards the sea-borne trade, the imports amounted to \u00a3899,977 in value in 1881-82; and the exports to \u00a3986,369. Total value of sea-borne import and export trade in 1881-82, \u00a31,886,346. The port dues and pilotage fees on vessels in 1881-82 yielded \u00a36082. The principal sea imports are salt, which was imported to the extent of 275,564 cwts. in 1881-82; and European twist, yarn, and piece-goods, to the value of \u00a3186,450. The exports included rice (864,462 cwts. in 1881-82); jute and gunny (613,471 cwts.); and tea (736,817 lbs., value \u00a367,117).\n\nThe water on the right bank of the river Karnaphuli (the side on which the port is situated) is becoming shallower every year\u2014a fact which is accounted for by the action of the river. About two miles above Chittagong, the stream sets strongly against the right bank, and being thrown off with considerable force, strikes with increasing vehemence against the left bank, about a mile above the town. Broad strips of land are thus yearly washed away into the river, and a large char or sandbank has formed in front of the upper portion of the town. Artificial means have been taken to protect the port; and the current, again thrown off, sets against the left bank once more, and has scoured out a new channel, separated from the shipping by a char in the middle of the river.\n\nChittagong has more than once played a conspicuous part in history. It was besieged and captured in 1665 by the Mughals, under Umed Kh\u00e1n, who changed the name of the place to Isl\u00e1m\u00e1b\u00e1d (vide Chittagong District). In 1857, on the night of the 18th November, the men of the 34th Native Infantry, stationed at Chittagong, suddenly mutinied. They released all the prisoners in the jail, killing one native constable, and early on the morning of the 19th left the station, carrying away\nwith them three Government elephants, some ammunition, and treasure to the value of about \u00a327,800, of which about \u00a35000 was subsequently recovered. No one but the native constable was killed; and the \u00e9meute was not of any serious consequence.\n\n**Chittagong Hill Tracts.**\u2014District in the Chittagong Division of the Lieutenant-Governorship of Bengal, lying between $21^\\circ 13'$ and $23^\\circ 47'$ N. lat., and between $91^\\circ 46'$ and $92^\\circ 49'$ E. long. Area, 5419 square miles. Population (1881) 101,597 souls. Bounded on the north by Hill Tipperah State, on the west by Chittagong District, and on the south by the Burmese District of Akyab. The eastern boundary is formed by a line running from the south-east corner of Hill Tipperah, along the course of the T\u00fclenpu\u00ef or S\u00e1jj\u00fck river, to its junction with the Karnaphuli; thence along the course of the T\u00faichang, across the Uip\u00fam range to the west, and along the Th\u00e9g\u00e1 Kh\u00e1l to its headwaters; thence westward along the watershed of the Weybong-tang, until it meets the southern hill station of Keokradong on the Arakan frontier. The administrative head-quarters are at Rangamati, but the most populous place in the District is Bandarban.\n\n**Physical Aspects.**\u2014The District is divided into four valleys, constituted by its four principal rivers\u2014the Phen\u00ed, the Karnaphuli, the Sangu, the Matamuri, and their tributaries\u2014and marked by chains of hills running from the south in a north-westerly direction. The Sangu and M\u00e1t\u00e1mur\u00ed rivers, until they enter the plains, run parallel to the ranges, forming two regular valleys; the Karnaphuli and Phen\u00ed flow transversely across the main line of the hills, and the valleys here are formed by large tributaries of the Karnaphuli entering the river at right angles to its course. The general aspect of the District has been described as \u2018a tangled mass of hill, ravine, and cliff, covered with dense tree, bush, and creeper jungle. The intervals between the smaller hill ranges are filled up with a mass of jungle, low hills, small watercourses, and swamps of all sizes and descriptions, so erratic in their configuration as to render any description impossible. . . . From the summits of the main ranges, the view of the apparently boundless sea of forest is grand in the extreme. Viewed from these points, the lower jungle almost assumes the appearance of a level green plain, while in reality it is one of the most difficult countries to pass through that can be imagined.\u2019 Along the valleys and courses of the chief rivers, the scenery is of a different character, being for the most part dull and uninteresting. The banks of the rivers are generally covered with tall elephant grass or dense jungle, which effectually prevents any view being obtained of the surrounding country. There are, however, some striking exceptions to this account of the river scenery; and Captain T. H. Lewin (to whose *Hill Tracts of Chittagong and the Dwellers therein*, this article is greatly indebted) has described in very eloquent language the scenes which are occasionally\nto be met with. Near R\u00e1ng\u00e1m\u00e1t\u00ed, on the Karnaphul\u00ed river, for example, 'the character of the scenery'\u2014writes Captain Lewin\u2014'changes from its usual dull monotony of reaches of still water and walls of dark-green verdure, to a scene of marvellous beauty, resembling somewhat the view on the Rhine near the Lurleiberg. Dark cliffs of brown vitreous rock, patched and mottled with lichens and mosses of various colours, tower up on either hand; while, occasionally, on the right or left, shoots back a dark gorge of impenetrable jungle.'\n\nThe same writer describes exquisite bits of scenery along some of the affluents of the M\u00e1t\u00e1m\u00fari river. The chief rivers of the District have already been named, and will be found fully described under their respective names. The most important of them, the Karnaphul\u00ed, called by the hillmen Kynsa Khyoung, rises in a lofty range of hills to the north-east, and, after flowing by a most tortuous course through the Hill Tracts, enters Chittagong District at the village of Chandragun\u00e1. The Sangu, which rises in the hill range dividing the District from Arakan, after a course, generally northerly, of about 125 miles, reaches Band\u00e1rban, below which point it is affected by the tide. The Pheni forms the northern boundary of the District. Although all these rivers are of great depth during the rains, the rapidity and violence of their currents, their sharp turns and whirling eddies, render them, practically speaking, unavailable for large craft within the limits of the District, and present considerable dangers to small boats. In addition to these rivers, the District is intersected by a network of hill streams, navigable for some distance by canoes, but which cannot be classed as navigable rivers.\n\nA mountain lake of great beauty, situated on the east side of the R\u00e1makr\u00ed Tang hill, was discovered in 1875 by Lieutenant Gordon, the officer in charge of the Sangu Sub-division. It is about a mile long by a quarter of a mile broad, and well stocked with fish. The mountains of the District are steep, and can only be ascended slowly and painfully by men, along known zig-zag paths, or by cutting similar tracks through the jungle with which they are covered. The highest hills are\u2014R\u00e1ng-r\u00e1ng-dang (2789 feet) and Lur\u00e1i Tang (2355 feet), both peaks in the Tyambang range; and Basitang (2181 feet), the principal peak of a range of the same name. Valuable forest trees are found throughout almost the entire area of the Chittagong Hill Tracts. Nearly the whole area (5419 square miles) was, in 1871, declared to be Government forest; and the collection of all the revenue tolls in the District, which had previously been leased to the hill chiefs, was transferred to the Forest Department. The amount realized by Government in 1870-71, by leasing out the right to levy tolls on forest produce, was \u00a31013; the amount realized by the Forest Department at its 19 toll stations in 1880-81 was \u00a37306, the expenditure incurred during that year being only \u00a31242. Both lignite and coal have been found in the Chittagong\nHill Tracts, and specimens have been analyzed; but the proportion of ash proved too large to hold out any prospect of working the mineral at a profit. Limestone is also found, but of an inferior quality, and its manufacture has proved unprofitable. Sandstone exists in abundance. Salt-licks are found at many places, and are utilized by the Kuk\u00eds as sources of the local salt-supply by boiling down the water in conical earthen pots. Elephants are found in great numbers, and a considerable portion of the Government supply is derived from the forests of this District. During the years 1866\u201368, the officers of the Elephant (Khed\u00fa) Department captured and took away no fewer than 200 of these animals. The rhinoceros is common, and tigers are numerous. Among other animals met with are the leopard, the Malay black bear, the jungle cat, the wild buffalo, the barking deer, the sambhar deer, the lemur, and several kinds of monkeys. Snakes are eaten by the hill people, and are eagerly sought after; numerous varieties are found. The boa-constrictor is common, and often grows to an enormous size. Amongst the birds of the District may be mentioned the Polyplectron and the matur\u00e1 or Arakan pheasant, button quails, jungle fowl, wood pigeons, and a few partridges, wild duck, and snipe.\n\nHistory.\u2014The history of the Chittagong Hill Tracts is a record of constantly-recurring raids on the part of the bordering hill tribes, against whom it has more than once been necessary to send punitive military expeditions. The earliest record of our dealings with the people of these hills is a letter from the Chief of Chittagong to Warren Hastings, the Governor-General, dated 10th April 1777, complaining of the violence and aggressions of a mountaineer named R\u00e1mu Kh\u00e1n, the leader of a band of Kuk\u00eds or Lush\u00e1\u00eds. Again, in the end of the same year, military help was required \u2018for the protection of the inhabitants against the Kuk\u00eds.\u2019 In 1860, the same tribe made a murderous raid into Tipperah District, killing 186 British subjects, and taking 100 prisoners. In January of the following year, a military force was assembled at Barkal to punish the offenders. The village of the chief, 18 miles north-east of Barkal, was found deserted and in flames; and the negotiations which followed for the pacification of the country ended in the submission of Rattan Puiya in October 1861. In 1864, 1865, and 1866, the Shendus made several raids; and between 1866 and 1871, the Haulong clan of Lush\u00e1\u00eds gave constant trouble. In 1870\u201371, this tribe perpetrated in Cachar a series of raids of an unusually aggravated character, in the course of which the lives of several Europeans were sacrificed, and the daughter of a planter, together with many native British subjects, was carried away captive by the raiders. These outrages determined the Government to undertake effective reprisals. Two military columns entered the Lush\u00e1i country simultaneously, one from Cachar under General Bouchier, the other from\nChittagong under General Brownlow. The operations of these columns, extending over a period of five months, were entirely successful; the captives were recovered, and the offending tribes tendered their submission, and were required to pay a heavy fine for their unprovoked attacks. Since that date, no disturbance has taken place within British territory, although intertribal affrays have occurred beyond the frontier. The Hill Tracts were separated from the Regulation District of Chittagong in 1860.\n\nPopulation.\u2014According to the Census of 1881, the Chittagong Hill Tracts contain a population of 101,597 persons, spread over an area of 5419 square miles, and inhabiting 15,003 houses. The average density of the population is 18.75 per square mile, and the average number of houses, 2.77 per square mile. Classified according to sex, the number of males is 56,546, and of females, 45,051. The great majority of the population are either Chakm\u00e1s or Maghs (more correctly, Kyoungth\u00e1), both of which races profess the Buddhist religion, and are about equally divided in number. These two Buddhist tribes together number 73,970, or 72.8 per cent. of the population. The remainder consist of 7292 Muhammadans, 20,285 Hindus, and 50 Christians, including 1 unspecified. The tribes inhabiting the District are divided into two classes\u2014(1) the Kyoungth\u00e1, or 'Children of the River,' who are of Arakanese origin, speak the ancient Arakan dialect, and follow the Buddhist religion and customs; and (2) the Toungth\u00e1, or 'Children of the Hills,' who are either aborigines or of mixed origin, speak different dialects, and are more purely savages than the Kyoungth\u00e1. The Kyoungth\u00e1 (or Jumi\u00e1 Maghs, as they are also called) are sub-divided into 15 clans; they all dwell in village communities, having a ro\u00faj\u00e1 or village head, through whom they pay revenue. The villages to the south of the Karnaphuli river are subject to a chief called the Bohmong, who lives at Band\u00e1rban, on the Sangu river; while those to the north of the Karnaphuli acknowledge the supremacy of the Mong R\u00e1j\u00e1. Their spoken language is a dialect of Arakanese; the written character is the same as the Burmese. The Chakm\u00e1s form numerically the largest tribe in the District. Although the majority of them do not speak Arakanese, Captain Lewin classes them with the Kyoungth\u00e1 on account of the similarity of their habits. The name is sometimes spelt Tsakm\u00e1 or Tsak, or, in Burmese, Thek. Mr. Hodgson believes that they are of aboriginal descent. The tribe is divided into 40 clans, each presided over by an hereditary divin or head-man, who decides disputes, etc. Although the Chakm\u00e1s profess the Buddhist faith, they are, in consequence of their constant contact with Beng\u00e1l\u00eds, gradually evincing a tendency towards Hinduism. In one point they differ from all the other hill tribes,\u2014they are very averse to changing the sites of their villages, which are kept from generation to generation.\nat one place. The Toungth\u00e1 tribes, or 'Children of the Hills,' consist of the Tipperahs, Mrungs, Kum\u00eds, Mros, and Khyengs, all tributary and entirely under British control; the Bang\u00eds and Pankhos, who, although paying no revenue, are subject to our influence; and the Lush\u00e1is or Kuk\u00eds, and the Shendus, who are entirely independent. These tribes are in every respect wilder than the Kyoungth\u00e1, and less amenable to civilisation. Their villages are generally situated on lofty hills, and are difficult of access. Their clothing is extremely scanty, and their women do not hold so high a position as those of the Kyoungth\u00e1 tribes. 'They worship the natural elements, and have vague and undefined ideas of some divine power which overshadows all.' Detailed accounts of the manners and customs of each of the tribes of the District will be found in Captain Lewin's valuable work already referred to.\n\nThere are no towns of any importance in the District. The largest village is Bandarban, the residence of the Bohmong, which has a population of about 2000. The village of R\u00e1ng\u00e1m\u00e1ti, the head-quarters of the District, had, in 1881, a population of only 792. Apart from the military police force, the Government servants, and a few Bengali shopkeepers, the whole population is agricultural.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Rice is the staple crop of the District. It is sown in April or May, and reaped in August, September, or October, according to the kind of crop. There are fourteen principal varieties, with numerous sub-divisions, differing more or less in colour and size of the grain and husk. The method of cultivation is that known as j\u00fam, which has been well described by Captain Lewin, from whose book, already referred to, the following account is condensed. In April, a convenient piece of forest land is fixed upon, generally on a hill-side. This is cleared by cutting away the undergrowth and denuding the larger trees of their lower branches. The fallen jungle is then allowed to dry in the sun, and in May it is fired. If it has thoroughly dried, and no rain has fallen since the j\u00fam was cut, this firing reduces all but the large forest trees to ashes, and burns the soil to the depth of an inch or two. The charred trees and logs previously cut down remain lying about the ground, and have to be dragged off the j\u00fam. They are piled up all round, and form, with the addition of brushwood, a sort of fence to keep out wild animals. Nothing now remains to be done, until the gathering of heavy clouds and the grumbling of thunder herald the approach of the rains. Then all is activity; and the j\u00fam is planted with the mixed seeds of cotton, rice, melons, pumpkins, yams, and a little Indian corn. If, shortly afterwards, or better still, during the process of sowing, rain falls, a good harvest may be expected. The j\u00fams, which are always in clusters, are carefully watched to protect them from wild hog and deer, which would other-\nwise play havoc among the young rice; and the crops must be kept clear of weeds by hand labour. The first to ripen is Indian corn, about the end of July; next melons, of two or three sorts; afterwards vegetables of all kinds; and in September, the rice and other grain. In October, the cotton crop is gathered, and this ends the harvest. The rice, having been cut, is beaten from the ear in the jum; it is afterwards rolled up in rough, straw-covered bales, and carried to the village granary. The crops grown for export are cotton, tobacco, tea, and potatoes. During the last few years, attempts have been made to introduce plough cultivation, but with little success. In order to put a stop to the extortion of money-lenders, who charged exorbitant rates of usury for advances to the hillmen, the Government sanctioned advances without interest, the amount not to exceed the money to be expended on local works during the following season. The advances are repaid by labour; and under this system the price of the labour of the hillmen during November, December, and January may be estimated at 7\u00bdd. a day. During the cultivating season, local labour is not obtainable even at the rate of 2s. a day, and coolies from Chittagong District have to be engaged, whose average daily wage is 6\u00bed. each. The price of rice in 1870 was 6s. 3d. per cwt. for the best, and 4s. 1\u00bdd. per cwt. for the common description. Paddy sold in that year at 1s. 9d. per cwt. for the best, and 1s. 4d. per cwt. for the coarser quality. Prices vary much in different parts of the District.\n\nIn order that the jum mode of cultivation may be successful, the cultivator must move every year to a fresh piece of jungle land, so that tenures, properly so called, only exist where the indigenous system of cultivation has been abandoned. Land tenures are, indeed, found within the boundaries of the Chittagong Hill Tracts; but with the exception of forest and grass land settlements, they are merely extensions of those in the Regulation District of Chittagong, and only differ from them in that they now lie beyond the Collector's jurisdiction.\n\nPigs, deer, monkeys, and birds are very destructive to the crops, which require to be watched day and night. Armies of rats occasionally overrun the District, and commit great havoc; they eat both standing corn and the grain in the houses of the hill people, and disappear from the Hill Tracts as suddenly as they come. In 1881-82, an irruption of these pests devastated the country both beyond the frontier, and within the British territories of the Hill Tracts, to such an extent as to cause famine, and to necessitate Government relief in the shape of advances of money and grain. Loss of crops from flood is scarcely possible in this hilly country, but cotton is sometimes injured by a too heavy rainfall, especially when this occurs at the beginning of the rainy season.\nCommerce and Trade.\u2014The chief imports of the Chittagong Hill Tracts are rice and salt; and the more valuable exports, raw cotton and India rubber. The imports in 1880\u201381 were\u2014paddy, or unhusked rice, 1642 tons; rice, 596 tons; and salt, 255 tons; exports\u2014raw cotton, 3993 tons; and india rubber, 9 tons. The chief markets are at K\u00e1s\u00e1lang, R\u00e1ng\u00e1m\u00e1ti, Chandragun\u00e1, and Dem\u00e1giri, on the Karnaphuli river; Malch\u00e1ri, on the Chengri; Band\u00e1rban, on the Sangu; and Tipperah B\u00e1z\u00e1r and Grish Chandra B\u00e1z\u00e1r, on the Pheni river. The roads in the Hill Tracts are mere footpaths; and even where they have been made of considerable width, there is so little traffic that the jungle has again sprung up and left only enough clear space to enable persons to walk in single file.\n\nAdministration.\u2014In 1846\u201347, the whole revenue of the Hill Tracts consisted of the capitation tax, amounting to \u00a31180; and it was not until 1866\u201367 that any attempt was made to improve the revenue. In that year it amounted to \u00a33394, while the total expenditure was \u00a38440. In 1870\u201371, the revenue amounted to \u00a34206, and the expenditure to \u00a314,332. By 1874\u201375, the total revenue had increased (owing mainly to the collection of river-tolls having been made over to the Forest Department) to \u00a312,799; while the expenditure was \u00a319,404, of which \u00a314,804 was on account of the military police maintained for the protection of the frontier, leaving only \u00a34600 for all other expenses of administration. In 1881\u201382, the total revenue amounted to \u00a312,763, or \u00a336 less than in 1874\u201375. But in 1874\u201375, \u00a310,244 represented the revenue from river-tolls and forest produce, leaving only \u00a32555 for the remaining items, such as capitation and land tax, and other miscellaneous sources of income. In 1881\u201382, the revenue from river tolls and forest produce was \u00a37720, the decrease being caused by reductions in the rates of tolls; while the other sources of revenue, mentioned above, amounted to \u00a35043, or nearly double what it was in 1874\u201375. On the other hand, the expenditure has risen from \u00a319,404 in 1874\u201375 to \u00a323,101 in 1881\u201382, the increase being mainly due to the enhanced cost of maintenance of the frontier force, which amounted to \u00a319,668 in 1881\u201382. The machinery for the protection of person and property in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, although called by the name of police, is for the most part a military force, trained and expensively armed so as to serve as a protection to the District against raids from the tribes farther east. The police employed purely on civil duties numbered in 1881\u201382, 109 men of all ranks; while the frontier or semi-military police numbers 539 of all ranks. Both forces are embodied under Act v. of 1861, but the latter are subject to the provisions of a special Regulation (iii. of 1881), which provides penalties for offences of a military character. There is no jail in the Hill Tracts; convicts being sent to Chittagong town.\nTwo Government schools were established in the District, in 1875, at R\u00e1ngam\u00e1ti and M\u00e1nikchari. They are both boarding-schools; and although free tuition, together with the payment of all ordinary expenses, is offered in order to induce the most promising boys to attend, the greatest difficulty is experienced in getting the hill people to send their sons.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate of the Hill Tracts is cool, and to natives healthy, though the reverse is the case with strangers. The most unhealthy month is September, at the close of the rains, and fever of a bad type is then very prevalent. Cholera in an epidemic form occurred in 1881\u201382, and it is believed caused the death of over 4000 persons.

The broadest portion has a depth of some 12 miles. The range derives its name from the white nummulitic limestone of which it is composed. Here and there patches of acacia or wild olive clothe its rugged sides, but over the main portion a coarse grass forms the only vegetation. No rivers of any importance rise upon its slopes, the western end being drained by gorges which debouch directly into the Indus, while ravines on the northern and southern declivities carry off the surface water into minor streams on either side. The separate hills assume most fantastic shapes, being furrowed by broad glens, and interspersed with conical hillocks; while the dark red or purple colour of the soil contrasts strongly with the white or blue-grey tint of the underlying rock. No human habitations exist upon the range; lime is produced in considerable quantities from quarries on its side.\n\nChitt\u00e1w\u00e1d\u00edgi.\u2014Town in Bellary District, Madras Presidency.

Situated 2 miles from Hospet, and the same distance from the Tungabhadra river. The chief market for the western t\u00e1l\u00faks of the District, and for goods imported from the N\u00edzam's Dominions. The town, which contains three or four good streets, is the residence of many of the leading merchants of Hospet.

At the town of Chittivalasa, a few miles from its mouth, it is bridged for the Trunk road.\n\n**Chittur.** \u2014 *Taluk* or Sub-division of North Arcot District, Madras Presidency; area, 671 square miles, containing 1 town and 460 villages. Houses, 30,227. Population (1881) 171,907, namely, 86,779 males and 85,128 females. Chittur is the most central taluk in North Arcot. It consists of a plain, broken by a large number of naked rocky hills rising abruptly from the surrounding country, and covered with enormous granite boulders. Watered by four streams, the Chittur, Venkatagiri, Aragunda, and Airala, all tributaries of the Poini river, which only contain water in the rainy season. The soil is good, being generally a red clay mixed with sand and fertilized by vegetable matter and detritus brought down from the hills. The peasantry mostly belong to Telugu castes, and are painstaking, industrial cultivators. The ordinary 'wet' crops are rice and sugar-cane; the 'dry' crops being *ragi*, *kambu*, and *cholam*, with horse gram on the poorer soils. Iron was formerly largely smelted in several villages, but this industry has greatly declined of late years. The other minerals comprise lime and building stone, and a soft soapstone. Land revenue demand in 1882-83, \u00a319,377. The taluk contains 1 civil and 3 criminal courts, with 8 police stations (*thana*s); strength of police force, 81 men.\n\n**Chittur** ('Little Town'). \u2014 Town in North Arcot District, Madras Presidency, and head-quarters of North Arcot District and of Chituir taluk.

Being the head-quarters of the District administration, it contains the courts of the Judge and Collector, with their subordinate establishments, District jail, police station, school, dispensary, etc. Besides the public offices, the town possesses an English church with a native mission chapel attached to it, and a Roman Catholic chapel. Chittur was a military station until 1874, but is now, except as the official centre, of no importance. Formerly a private estate of the Arcot family, and in 1781 occupied by the British troops under Sir Eyre Coote. Civil disturbances\nnecessitated in 1804 the realization of the revenue by means of a military force.\n\n**Chittur.**\u2014Town in the State of Cochin, Madras Presidency.

It takes its name from a large burial-ground, covering an area of 7 acres, and containing more than 7000 tombs, which is still used by the Mundas of Chokah\u00e1tu, and 9 surrounding villages.\n\n**Chokampati.**\u2014Estate in Tinnevell\u00ed District, Madras Presidency, lying between $8^\\circ 58'$ and $9^\\circ 10'$ N. lat., and between $77^\\circ 23'$ and $77^\\circ 32'$ E. long. Formerly of considerable importance, but now split up into 18 sub-holdings. The chief town, Chokampati, situated in lat. $90^\\circ 8'$ N., long. $77^\\circ 24' 20''$ E., contains 1327 houses, with (1881) 5945 inhabitants, almost all Hindus.\n\n**Chola (Choda; in Asoka's inscriptions, Chora; the Chorai of Ptolemy; Choliya of Hwen Thsang; and Sora of Pliny).**\u2014An ancient division of Dravida, conterminous, roughly, with the Tamil country north of the K\u00e1veri (Cauvery) river, and having its capital near the site of the modern Trichinopoli. In the 11th century, the Chola kings conquered the neighbouring kingdom of the P\u00e1ndiyans, and overran the whole country down to Cape Comorin, becoming the paramount power of the south, and giving princes to Teleng\u00e1na. They also conquered the Kongu country (or Eastern Chora, as it seems to have then\nbeen). The tradition as to the common origin of the three kingdoms of Chola, Chera, and P\u00e1ndya (see Chera) is borne out by the fact that the language of the Chol\u00e1s never differed from that of the P\u00e1ndyas, and but little from that of Chera, as appears from the Indo-Syrian and Jewish inscriptions of the 8th century. By whatever local or dynastic names they called themselves\u2014whether Cholas, Cheras, or P\u00e1ndyas\u2014they continued to be called Dravidas, and the language they spoke was everywhere known as Dravida or Tamil. The modern term Coromandel is by some writers believed to be a corruption of Cholamandalam, 'the realm of the Chol\u00e1s.' The Chola kingdom rose to its greatest height of prosperity under the great king, Kulottunga I. (A.D. 1064\u20131113). It was finally destroyed by the Muhammadan inroad of 1310.\u2014See Chera.\n\nChopda.\u2014Sub-division and town, Kh\u00e1ndesh District, Bombay Presidency.\u2014See Chopra.\n\nChope.\u2014Small coal-field situated in the valley of the Moh\u00e1n\u00ed river, Haz\u00e1rib\u00e1gh District, Bengal; about 8 miles in a direct line a little north of west from Haz\u00e1rib\u00e1gh town. Elevation, about 2000 feet above the sea. This coal-field, which takes its name from the principal village in the vicinity, is the smallest known in India, covering an area of only three-quarters of a square mile. The coal is consequently very limited in quantity, and, as it is also of poor quality, the field is of little value. It is approached from Haz\u00e1rib\u00e1gh by a road which, for the most part, passes over alluvium, but in its vicinity there are occasional outcrops of metamorphic rocks, some of which are accompanied by extremely rich deposits of iron.\u2014See Hazaribagh District.\n\nChopra (Chopda).\u2014Sub-division of Khandesh District, Bombay Presidency. Area, 368 square miles; contains 1 town and 91 villages. Population (1881) 59,835, namely, males 30,321, and females 29,514. Hindus number 51,660; Muhammadans, 5378; 'others,' 2797. The Sub-division consists of two valleys formed by a spur of the S\u00e1tp\u00fara ranges, that run across it obliquely from east to west. The southern valley is a part of the rich north T\u00e1pti plain, and follows the course of that river. The northern or inner valley, known as the Dhauli tarah, is a broken and hilly country, unsurveyed, covered with dense forest, inhabited by a wild tribe of Bh\u00edls, and infested by wild beasts. The southern or T\u00e1pti valley is fairly well supplied with well water, but none of the streams are suited for irrigation. The chief rivers are the T\u00e1pti, which forms the southern boundary of the Sub-division for 33 miles, and its tributaries, the Aner and the Guli. The prevailing soil is a rich, black, alluvial clay, resting on a yellowish subsoil. The total area surveyed is 295 square miles, or 248,800 acres. Of this, in 1878\u201379, 113,274 acres were under tillage, namely, 66,977 acres under cereals, 3605 acres under pulses, 7521 acres under oil-seeds, 33,816 acres\nunder fibres, and 1355 acres under miscellaneous crops. In 1856-57, the year of Settlement, 5217 separate holdings were returned, with an average area of 19.46 acres, each paying an average rental of \u00a32, 13s. 1d. Divided among the agricultural population, these holdings would represent an average of 7.66 acres for each person, paying an average rental of \u00a31, os. 10\u00bdd. Distributed among the total population, the average area would be 2.94 acres, and the average land tax, 8s. 0\u00bcd. per head. Total land revenue realizable in 1883, \u00a317,942. The Subdivision contained in the same year, 2 criminal courts, with 1 police station (th\u00e1nd); strength of regular police, 39 men; village watchmen (chaukid\u00e1rs), 115.\n\n**Chopra (Chopda).**\u2014Chief town of Chopra Sub-division in Kh\u00e1n-desh District, Bombay Presidency; 8 miles from the right bank of the river T\u00e1pti, 51 miles north-east of Dhuli\u00e1, and 32 north-west of Bhus\u00e1wal; in 21\u00b0 15' 15\" N. lat., and 75\u00b0 20' 25\" E. long. Chopra is probably a settlement of considerable antiquity, and its ruined fort shows that it was a place of much consequence under early Hindu rulers. In A.D. 1600, it was a large town and well peopled, with a temple of Rameshwar, to which Hindus came from great distances. It was handed over by Sindhia in 1820, restored to him in 1837, and came again under British rule in 1844. Population (1881) 13,932, of whom 11,005 are Hindus, 2,740 Musalm\u00e1ns, 111 Jains, and 76 'others;' area of town site, 305 acres. Municipal revenue (1881-82), \u00a3370; rate of taxation, 6d. per head. Post-office, dispensary, and 3 schools. Large trade in cotton and linseed.\n\n**Chora.**\u2014Town in the Jh\u00e1l\u00e1w\u00e1r District, K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay Presidency.

The chief is a Rahtor R\u00e1jput, but the bulk of the people are Kol\u00eds.\n\n**Chor\u00e1s\u00ed (Chaur\u00e1s\u00ed).**\u2014Sub-division of Surat District, Bombay Presidency. Area, 110 square miles; contains 2 towns and 65 villages. Population (1881) 154,608, namely, 78,072 males and 76,536 females. Hindus number 112,574; Muhammadans, 27,118; 'others,' 14,916. The Sub-division forms a richly-wooded plain, with highly-cultivated fields enclosed with hedges. With the exception of the T\u00e1pti, which forms the northern boundary of the Sub-division for about 18 miles, there is no river of importance, and the water-supply is defective, owing to the smallness of the village reservoirs, and the brackishness of the well water. Of the total cultivated Government area (excluding alienated lands), 25,412 acres were under cultivation in 1874. Grain crops occupied 10,314\nacres; pulses, 2810 acres; oil-seeds, 463 acres; fibres, 5141 acres; fallow or grass, 5811; and miscellaneous crops, 1245 acres. In 1865-66, the year of Settlement, 5880 separate holdings were returned of an average area of a little over $6\\frac{3}{4}$ acres each, and paying an average annual rental of \u00a34, 11s. od. Divided among the agricultural population, these holdings would represent an average of $2\\frac{3}{4}$ acres for each person, paying an average rental of \u00a31, 16s. 3d. Distributed among the total population, the average area would be 1.5 acres, and the average incidence of land-tax, 13s. 10\u00bdd. per head. Total land revenue realizable in 1883, \u00a321,179. The Sub-division, which includes Surat, the head-quarters of the District, contained in the same year, 4 civil and 10 criminal courts, with 2 police stations (th\u00e1n\u00e1s); strength of regular police, 213 men; village watchmen (chaukid\u00e1rs), 221.\n\n**Chot\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur.**\u2014See Chutia Nagpur; for Chot\u00e1 Bh\u00e1girathi, Chot\u00e1 Udepur, etc., see Chhota Bhagirathi, Chhota Udaipur, etc.\n\n**Choti.**\u2014Town in Der\u00e1 Gh\u00e1z\u00ed tahsil, Der\u00e1 Gh\u00e1z\u00ed Kh\u00e1n District, Punjab.

Population (1881) 13,495, distributed over 14 villages. Estimated gross revenue, \u00a39172. Transit dues through the State are not levied. The appearance of the country is flat, relieved at intervals by ranges of low rocky hills. The climate, though hot and dry, is healthy, the only prevailing disease being fever. The soil is generally light, producing besides the ordinary grains considerable quantities of cotton, which finds its way to the port of Dholer\u00e1. Chura ranks as a \u2018third-class\u2019 State among the many petty States in K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r. The ruler first entered into engagements with the British Government in 1807. The present chief, Bechar Singhji, a Jh\u00e1l\u00e1 R\u00e1jput, bears the title of Th\u00e1kur.

Lat. $21^\\circ 7'$ 50\" N., long. $86^\\circ 49'$ 16\" E. The mouth of the river has now silted up, and is so completely concealed by a dense fringe of jungle, that it is almost impossible for a stranger sailing down the coast to discover it. At present, no vessel exceeding 45 tons burthen can enter the river, even at high water. The rice sloops, which nominally receive their cargo at Chur\u00e1man, and its sister port, L\u00e1ichanpur on the K\u00e1nsb\u00e1ns, 5 miles to the north, in reality load from small boats while at anchor several miles out at sea, 6 miles being no uncommon distance in the case of sloops of 150 tons. Local tradition asserts that within recent times Chur\u00e1man was the principal port of Orissa, and this is corroborated by reference to the old records. In 1809, the Balasor Collector of Customs wrote that \u2018Chur\u00e1man is considered the most safe and convenient port on the coast of Orissa, and carries on a sea-going trade exceeding that of Balasor;\u2019 and again, in 1812, he reported that \u2018last year, no less a quantity than 1,100,000 maunds of rice were exported from the port of Chur\u00e1man and rivers contiguous thereto.\u2019 In 1873\u20131874, the value of the imports of Chur\u00e1man and L\u00e1ichanpur, taken\ntogether, amounted to \u00a3251, and of the exports to \u00a313,831; in 1874-75, the imports were nil, and the exports \u00a35834 in value; in 1881, the value of the imports was \u00a33062, and the exports \u00a38710.\n\n**Churesar.**\u2014Petty State in Rew\u00e1 K\u00e1ntha, Bombay Presidency; area, 2\u00bd square miles.

Bounded on the north by Rew\u00e1 State and by M\u00edrz\u00e1pur District in the North-Western Provinces; on the east by Loh\u00e1rdag\u00e1 and Singhbh\u00fam Districts; on the south by the Tributary States of Orissa and by Sambalpur District in the Central Provinces; and on the west by Bil\u00e1sipur District in the Central Provinces and by Rew\u00e1 State. These States are nine in number, viz. (1) Bon\u00e1i, (2) Chang Bhak\u00e1r, (3) Gangpur, (4) Jashpur, (5) Kharsawan, (6) Korea, (7) Sarai Alak, (8) Sarguja, and (9) Udaipur,\u2014all of which see separately in their alphabetical arrangement. The physical contour of the Tributary States is a confused mass of hills, ravines, and plateaux, which have been sculptured into their present shape by the combined action of rivers, wind, and rain. It is probable, indeed, that at a remote geological period, the entire country formed a uniform table-land about 3600 feet above the sea. Traces of such a state of things are to be found in the peculiar flat-topped hills, locally known as p\u00e2ts. These p\u00e2ts are capped with a horizontal stratum of trap rock, and stand up like pillars of earth left in making excavations, as if to mark the progress of the work of denudation. A distinct watershed can be traced right across the States from east to west, with a slight inclination towards the south. From the northern slope of this watershed, the Kanh\u00e1r and Rehr pass off to join the river system of Behar; while on the south, the Br\u00e1hmani, Ib, and M\u00e1na flow direct towards the Bay of Bengal.\n\n**Population.**\u2014It is now a matter of conjecture who were the original settlers in these States. It may be roughly stated that Gonds were the dominant race in the western, and Kols in the eastern States. On the disruption of the Gond kingdoms in Central India, that people drove the Kols backward almost to the frontier of Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur proper. Indeed, the limits of the ascendancy of the Dravidian and Kolarian races can be ascertained with tolerable accuracy in a large portion of the Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur Province, by observing to what tribe the principal military fief-holders belong. Thus, in the States of Chang Bhak\u00e1r, Korea, Sarguj\u00e1, and Udaipur, the chief feudal sub-proprietors are Gonds; in Jashpur, Korw\u00e1s; in Gangpur and Bon\u00e1i, Bhuiy\u00e1s; and in M\u00e1nbh\u00fam and Singhbh\u00fam Districts, Bhumijs. The people, however, who ultimately predominated, were not invariably the original settlers; and the evidence afforded by the military tenures should be confirmed by observing who are the peculiar priests of the aboriginal gods. Everywhere the belief is current that these local divinities are most readily propitiated by the tribe which has had the longest acquaintance with them\u2014that is, who first colonized the country. From scattered passages in Colonel Dalton\u2019s *Ethnology of Bengal*, it seems that in Gangpur and Bon\u00e1i, the priests of the sylvan deities are Bhuiy\u00e1s; in Jashpur and Sarguj\u00e1,\nKorw\u00e1s; and in Kore\u00e1 and Ch\u00e1nd Bhak\u00e1r, K\u00fars or Mu\u00e1s\u00eds. It would thus appear that in all but the two southern States of G\u00e1ngpur and Bon\u00e1i, which were first colonized by the Dravidian tribe of Bhuiy\u00e1s, the earliest settlers were of Kolarian descent. In Ch\u00e1ng Bhak\u00e1r, Kore\u00e1, Udaipur, and the western portion of Sarg\u00faj\u00e1, they were subjugated by the Gonds, who are now the principal sub-proprietors. But up to 1858, the Korw\u00e1s were in possession of military tenures in eastern Sarg\u00faj\u00e1; and in J\u00e1shpur, the head of the Korw\u00e1 fief-holders not only claims to be the hereditary div\u00e1n, or minister of the State, but is admitted by the R\u00e1j\u00e1 to be a descendant of the original rulers of the country.\n\nAssuming that Kolarian races were the first settlers in the country, and that they were afterwards subdued by the Dravidian Gonds, there remains a further and more difficult problem. In the wildest jungles of these States are found the remains of temples planned by skilled architects, crumbling embankments of fine tanks, and mango groves that are obviously not of natural growth. All these works the present inhabitants are incapable of constructing, nor have they any tradition that throws light on their existence. It has been supposed that they mark the settlements of early Aryan colonists who failed to civilise the aborigines, and, after a time, were either absorbed or driven out. But it is far more probable that they belong to the period of Gond ascendency in Central India, when the western States may well have been an outlying Province of Garh\u00e1 Mandl\u00e1 or Deogarh. The Gond monarchs were celebrated for the number and magnificence of their temples, tanks, plantations, and other public works; and in the Introduction to the Central Provinces Gazetteer it is noticed as a peculiar feature of the social development of the Gonds, that their princes were \u2018only able to advance by leaving the body of the people behind.\u2019 On this view, the limits of the Gond kingdom extended just so far as the remains of temples and tanks are met with. When the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 conquest swept over the country, the leaders of civilisation who built the temples and dug the tanks, disappeared, while the mass of the population was reduced to a state of barbarism. This hypothesis is not to be considered as a conclusive solution of a notoriously obscure question; but there seems to be a presumption in favour of attributing these vestiges of civilisation to a powerful neighbouring kingdom, which was finally broken up so late as 1781, rather than to the semi-historical era of the Aryan advance into Hindust\u00e1n.\n\nThe population of the Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur Tributary States, as returned by the Census of 1881, was 678,002, spread over an area of 16,054 square miles, and occupying 112,554 houses. This shows an increase of 179,395, or 35'98 per cent., over the population returned in the Census Report for 1872. But this large percentage of increase is probably due\nto some extent to incorrectness in the returns for 1872. The total male population amounted in 1881 to 345,238, and the female to 332,764; proportion of males, 50.92 per cent. Average density of the population, 42.23 persons per square mile; villages per square mile, .23; houses per square mile, 7.01; persons per occupied house, 6.03.\n\nClassified according to religion, there were in 1881\u2014Hindus, 671,126; Muhammadans, 4504; Christians, 105; and \u2018others,\u2019 or aboriginal hill people still professing their primitive faiths, 2267. This by no means represents the ethnical classification, as in the religious return nearly the whole of the aboriginal population are returned as Hindus, and the process of converting aborigines into Hinduism goes on steadily.\n\nAccording to the ethnical classification, the aborigines number 355,403, or 52.4 per cent. of the population, classified as follows:\u2014Bhuiy\u00e1, 23,322; Bhumij, 12,686; Gond, 75,266; Kharw\u00e1r, 24,067; Koch, 116; Kol, 59,147; Sant\u00e1l, 17,216; and \u2018others,\u2019 143,583. The population of Hindu origin number 282,533; the principal castes being\u2014Br\u00e1hman, 8452; R\u00e1jput, 5258; Bagd\u00ed, 17,011; Baniy\u00e1, 50,151; Gw\u00e1l\u00e1, 45,742; Loh\u00e1r, 12,646; Kurmi, 14,288; and R\u00e1jwar, 14,475.

The southern or Sambalpur group, comprising Bon\u00e1i and G\u00e1ngpur, together with eight other States now under the Central Provinces, was ceded to the British Government in 1803 under the treaty of Deog\u00e1on by Raghuji Bhonsla II., the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 R\u00e1j\u00e1 of\nN\u00e1gpur. In 1806, the entire group, with the exception of R\u00e1igarh, was restored to the R\u00e1j\u00e1 gratuitously. In 1818, however, they again reverted to the British under a provisional agreement concluded with Madhuji Bhonsla (Ap\u00e1 S\u00e1hib), after the repulse of his treacherous attack upon the N\u00e1gpur Residency; and finally passed to us under the treaty of 1826, when Raghuji Bhonsla III., the successor of Ap\u00e1 S\u00e1hib, attained his majority. On the provisional cession of the States in 1818, it was found necessary to annul the feudal supremacy of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Sambalpur; and in 1821, separate sanads were made to each of the subordinate Chiefs, and the tribute was fixed on a lower scale than had been formerly payable. Up to 1860, the Sambalpur States were administered from R\u00e1nch\u00ed in Loh\u00e1rdag\u00e1 by the Governor-General's Agent for the South-West Frontier. In that year they were all, except Bon\u00e1i and G\u00e1ngpur, placed under the Superintendent of the Orissa Tributary States, and were soon afterwards incorporated with the new Commissionership of the Central Provinces. Bon\u00e1i and G\u00e1ngpur remain attached to Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur. The northern or Sarg\u00faj\u00e1 group of States embraces Ch\u00e1ng Bhak\u00e1r, J\u00e1sipur, Kore\u00e1, Udaipur, and the large State of Sarg\u00faj\u00e1, which last in early times exercised an ill-defined feudal supremacy over the rest. This group was first ceded to the British under the provisional agreement concluded with Madhuji Bhonsla (Ap\u00e1 S\u00e1hib) in 1818, and is not mentioned in the subsequent treaty of 1826. Under the rough military rule of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 dynasty of N\u00e1gpur, the position of the tributary Chiefs was of necessity uncertain and fluctuating. At one time they were held in severe check by a strong local governor, and at another left in almost complete independence. The British Government adhered to the latter system, and from the first declined to lay down any definite rules for the guidance of the Chiefs. Only a general line of policy was indicated; and the ascertained rights of the Chiefs, and of all classes of their subjects, together with such customs as were not inconsistent with the usages of civilised nations, were to be maintained in full. In the settlements made with the Chiefs, they were expressly authorized to realize from their subjects both rents and customary dues, with the exception of certain cesses which were prohibited as obstructive to trade. Separate engagements were also taken from each Chief, binding him to the right administration of the judicial and police powers entrusted to him. Precise rules for the administration of criminal justice were first promulgated in 1863, under which the Chiefs have power to fine up to the extent of \u00a35, or to inflict imprisonment with or without hard labour for two years. Another provision empowers them to pass sentence of imprisonment up to five years, or to fine to the extent of \u00a320; but all such sentences are referred to the Commissioner for confirmation. In all cases of heinous crime, for which a\nsentence of five years' imprisonment appears inadequate, the Chiefs, in the capacity of magistrates, remit the cases to the Commissioner, who tries the accused, and passes sentence. Sentences of death must be submitted to the Lieutenant-Governor for confirmation. The total tribute paid by the Chiefs amounts to \u00a3468, and most of them are also bound to supply a contingent for military service, if required. Their estimated revenue is approximately returned at \u00a326,400. The police system of the States is purely indigenous, and consists for the most part of the rural militia, who hold their lands on condition of rendering personal service to their Chiefs. On the whole, there is very little heinous crime. Murders occur occasionally, as might be expected among half-civilised races; but serious offences against property are rare, and petty crime is sufficiently dealt with by the Chiefs under the supervision of the Commissioner. A characteristic feature of the crime returns is the number of charges of defamation of character brought by women who have been denounced as witches. The belief in witchcraft still survives in full strength; and in 1873, two reputed witches were murdered, and others maltreated, in G\u00e1ngpur. [For further information regarding the Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur Tributary States, see the separate articles in their alphabetical arrangement. Also the Statistical Account of Bengal, vol. xvii. pp. 149 to 250 (London : Tr\u00fcbner & Co., 1877); and the Bengal Census Report for 1881.]\n\nChutiy\u00e1.\u2014A semi-Hinduized tribe probably of Sh\u00e1n descent, at one time dominant in Upper Assam. Their territories extended over the present Districts of Sibs\u00e1gar and Southern Lakhimpur. When the Ahams first arrived in Assam, a Chutiy\u00e1 king reigned at Garhga\u00f3n, and the two kindred tribes lived for long on neighbourly terms with each other. They are said to have been first brought into hostile relations by the treacherous murder of the Aham chief by the Chutiy\u00e1 king who had invited him to a friendly boat race. The struggle which followed between the two kindred tribes lasted for a century and a quarter, and ended only on the final defeat and death of the Chutiy\u00e1 king, and the annexation of his territory by the Ahams. The following account of this tribe, which is still numerous in Upper Assam, is condensed from the Assam Census Report for 1881. The Chutiy\u00e1s of the present day are divided into four classes, known as Hindu, Aham, Bor\u00e1hi, and Deori. The first two of these are completely Hinduized. They are practically equals and eat together, although the Hindu Chutiy\u00e1s assert a nominal superiority on the ground of their earlier conversion to Hinduism. The Bor\u00e1hi Chutiy\u00e1s rank much lower, and the two higher classes (Hindus and Ahams) will not associate or eat with them. They were the first of the Chutiy\u00e1 tribes subdued by the Ahams, who employed them as cooks, keepers of fowls, and in other menial offices, which probably accounts for the low estimation in which\nthey are still held. They are few in number, and although nominally Hindus, still adhere in part to their ancient religious customs.\n\nThe Deori or priestly Chutiy\u00e1s form the best representative class of the original race. A few of their villages are found on the Dikrang in North Lakhimpur, on the banks of the Brahmaputra between North Lakhimpur and Majuli island, and again on the Tengapani in the extreme east of the valley. They are worshippers of Durga under the names of Gokh\u00e1n\u00ed, Tamurasai Mai, and Khesakhati. The first name signifies the wife of Mah\u00e1deo in his form as a religious mendicant; the second refers to a copper-roofed temple on the Dhola east of Sadiy\u00e1; the third, literally \u2018eaters of raw flesh,\u2019 recalls the human and uncooked meat sacrifices which this priestly tribe were wont to offer. Durga has taken the place of a number of evil spirits which the Chutiy\u00e1s used to appease by sacrifices. This copper temple on the Dhola, now abandoned, was endowed by the Aham kings with money and lands, and supplied with an annual human victim. It seems to have been a centre of worship for all the wild tribes of the frontier, until the arrival of the Burmese and the later raids of the Mishmis compelled large numbers of Chutiy\u00e1s to emigrate farther south to their present abodes. The Deori Chutiy\u00e1s have never employed the services of Br\u00e1hmans, but offer their propitiatory sacrifices through their own priests; nor have they adopted the Hindu ritual. A Deori village is made up of about 30 houses, built on bamboo platforms raised five feet from the ground. Each house consists of one large undivided room, often containing a family of 40 persons, and a verandah in front for visitors. The men are tall and well-nourished, with a strong resemblance to the K\u00e1ch\u00e1r\u00eds. Any connection with the K\u00e1ch\u00e1r\u00eds is, however, indignantly repudiated by them. But their language has a close affinity to the K\u00e1ch\u00e1ri, and they are regarded by some as a branch of the great Bodo race. They drink spirits, and eat all kinds of flesh, except beef. Like the K\u00e1ch\u00e1r\u00eds, they will not drink milk, although they keep buffaloes and trade in dairy produce. Child-marriage and polygamy are unknown, and marriages are generally negotiated by the parents of the bride on a business basis, in which the price of the bride sometimes rises to as high as \u00a310. Love matches, in defiance of parental arrangements, are, however, not uncommon. The Chutiy\u00e1s burn their dead. The Chutiy\u00e1s in the Assam Valley in 1881 were returned at 59,163, of whom 29,952 were in Sibs\u00e1g\u00e1r and 16,708 in Lakhimpur District.\n\nCirc\u00e1rs, the Northern (Sark\u00e1r, \u2018a government\u2019).\u2014The historical name for a large tract of country lying between 15\u00b0 40' and 20\u00b0 17' N. lat., and between 79\u00b0 12' and 85\u00b0 20' E. long., along the coast of the Bay of Bengal, within the Madras Presidency. It extended over about 17,000 square miles, and corresponded in general outline with the British Districts of Ganj\u00e1m, Vizagapatam, God\u00e1var\u00ed, Kistna, and part\nof Nellore and Karn\u00fal (Kurnool), stretching from the Chilk\u00e1 Lake, its northern limit, to the Gandlakamma river, its southern boundary. Previous to the Muhammadan period, it was known by the Hindu names of Kalinga, Teling\u00e1na, and Andhra. On the east it was bounded by the sea, and on the west by the hills running from the God\u00e1var\u00ed to Gumsar (Goomsur), which separated it throughout from the Niz\u00e1m's Dominions. In breadth, the Northern Circ\u00e1rs ranged from 18 to 100 miles.\n\nFrom the 5th to the 11th centuries, the north of this tract was subject to the Kesari or Lion-kings of Orissa. In the 12th century appeared the Gajapati dynasty (the Elephant-kings), whose rule extended southwards to the God\u00e1var\u00ed, the Narapatis (Lords of men) reigning contemporaneously over the southern portion (see Conjevaram). In the 15th century, a disputed succession in Ganj\u00e1m led to Muhammadan interference. Mumammad Sh\u00e1h, the last but one of the B\u00e1hmani dynasty of the Deccan, being appealed to by one of the claimants, invested him with the title in dispute, and extended his dominion as a tributary over the countries of Kondapalli (Condapilly), R\u00e1j\u00e1mahendri (R\u00e1jahmundry), and Ellore, as far south as the present British District of Nellore. In the 16th century, the B\u00e1hmani dynasty succumbed, and their tributary protectorate in the Circ\u00e1rs passed, not without a struggle with the Chiefs of the northern divisions, under the power of the Kutab Sh\u00e1h\u00ed princes. In the 17th century, the Kutab Sh\u00e1h\u00ed dominions fell to Aurangzeb; but for thirty years no serious attempt was made to impose the Delhi rule upon the Circ\u00e1rs. Early in the 18th century, however, the office of S\u00fabahd\u00e1r of the Deccan was created; and Niz\u00e1m-ul-mulk, the first incumbent, appointed two lieutenants to the governments of the coast Provinces \u2014 Anw\u00e1r-ud-d\u00edn, afterwards Naw\u00e1b of the Karnatic, being placed over Chicacole and the north, and R\u00fastam Kh\u00e1n over R\u00e1j\u00e1mahendri and the south. The Northern Circ\u00e1rs at this time comprised the 5 divisions of Chicacole, Kondapalli, R\u00e1j\u00e1mahendri, Ellore, and Gant\u00far (Guntoor). Chicacole, or Kalinga, comprising the present Vizagapatam and Ganj\u00e1m Districts, with a portion of the adjoining country, was sub-divided into Ichhapur, Kas\u00edmkota, and Chicacole, the P\u00fandi river forming its northern boundary. For a time this division was known to the Muhammadans as Gulchan\u00e1b\u00e1d. R\u00e1j\u00e1mahendri extended to Coconada, while south of it to the Kistna was Kondapalli. Between Kondapalli and the southern branch of the God\u00e1var\u00ed, lay Ellore; and still farther south, to Ongole, stretched Gant\u00far (Guntoor). Besides these was the coast strip known as Mas\u00fal\u00edpatam havili, held as a personal estate by the reigning power, in which lay Mas\u00fal\u00edpatam, the chief town and fortress of the Northern Circ\u00e1rs. To all these the Muhammadans gave new names; but it is noteworthy that none have survived. In 1750, Muzaffar Jang succeeded to the Subahd\u00e1rship of the Deccan, and ceded Mas\u00fal\u00edpatam, with the country adjacent, to the\nFrench, by whose assistance he had obtained his position. Two years later, his successor, Sal\u00e1bat Jang, extended the grant to the whole of the Northern Circ\u00e1rs. M. Bussy, who was appointed to the government of the new tract, united the whole, not, however, without great trouble in Chicacole, Bobbili, and other places, under the titular chiefship of Vijayar\u00e1m, R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Vijayanagar. He was succeeded by Anandar\u00e1j Gajapati, who, after making offers in vain to our Madras Government (then embarrassed by the French besieging the capital), surrendered the Circ\u00e1rs to our Bengal chiefs. Lord Clive at once sent an army southwards, which, after defeating the French, stormed Mas\u00falipatam. A treaty was concluded with Sal\u00e1bat Jang, by which all the territory dependent on Mas\u00falipatam, about 80 miles in length and 20 in breadth, was ceded to the British. In 1761, Niz\u00e1m Al\u00ed supplanted Sal\u00e1bat Jang; and in the following year, four of the Circ\u00e1rs were offered by him to the East India Company on condition of affording military aid. The offer was refused; but in 1766 we obtained a grant for all the five Circ\u00e1rs from the Delhi court. To secure the possession, the fort of Kondapalli was seized, and a treaty of alliance signed with Niz\u00e1m Al\u00ed at Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d (Hyder\u00e1b\u00e1d), November 12, 1766. By this treaty the Company, in consideration of \u2018the grant of the Circ\u00e1rs,\u2019 engaged to maintain troops at an annual cost of \u00a390,000, for the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s assistance whenever required. Gant\u00far (or Kondavir, as it was sometimes called), being a personal estate of the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s brother, Bas\u00e1lat Jang, was, as a matter of courtesy, excepted during his lifetime.\n\nTwo years later, the Niz\u00e1m having in the meantime associated himself with Haidar Al\u00ed against the Company, another treaty was signed (on the 1st of March 1768), in which he acknowledged the validity of the Delhi grant and resigned the Circ\u00e1rs (Gant\u00far again excepted) to the Company, receiving as a mark of friendship, \u00a350,000 per annum. In 1769, the Circ\u00e1rs were taken under direct management; and in 1778, Gant\u00far also was rented, by special treaty, from Bas\u00e1lat Jang, for his lifetime. In the following year, the Niz\u00e1m was again in alliance with Haidar Ali, on the pretext that the Company had withheld payments due on account of the Circ\u00e1rs; and the Government restored Gant\u00far to Bas\u00e1lat Jang for his life. He died in 1782; but it was not until 1788 that Gant\u00far came under British administration, and then on the promise of \u00a370,000 per annum. In 1823, this annual payment was consolidated into a lump sum, and the whole of \u2018the Northern Circ\u00e1rs\u2019 thus became a British possession.\n\nCircular Road Canal.\u2014Canal in the District of the Twenty-four Pargan\u00e1s, Bengal, leading from the H\u00fagl\u00ed river at B\u00e1gh B\u00e1z\u00e1r on the north of Calcutta, to the old toll-house on the Salt Water Lake. Length, 6 miles. Lat. $22^\\circ 34'$ to $22^\\circ 36' 30''$ N.; long. $88^\\circ 24' 30''$ to $88^\\circ 25' 15''$ E.\nCis-Sutlej States. \u2014 Tract of country in the Punjab, including the British Districts of Amb\u00e1l\u00e1 (Umballa), Ludhi\u00e1na, Firozpur (Ferozepore), and Hiss\u00e1r, and the Native States of Pati\u00e1la, Jind, and N\u00e1bha. The term was first applied to the Sikh principalities which arose to the south of the Sutlej (Satlaj) during the last years of the Delhi Empire. After the suicidal contests of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s and the Dur\u00e1ni princes, the Sikhs began to cross over from the Punjab proper (see Amritsar District) into the territory beyond the great boundary river, and soon acquired for themselves the whole stretch of country between the Sutlej and the Jumna valley. When the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 power in Upper India fell before the British conquerors in 1803, the whole of this intervening tract was already parcelled out among numerous chieftains, from the powerful R\u00e1j\u00e1 of the Pati\u00e1la principality to the petty sard\u00e1rs who held a few villages under a precarious sway. After the establishment of the British power to the east, the various Native rulers continued to wage perpetual war upon one another, until the consolidation of the Lahore Government, under Ranjit Singh, forced them to unite in resistance to the common enemy. The great Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 at last appeared on the south of the Sutlej, and demanded tribute. Thereupon the Cis-Sutlej princes, fearing the fate which had befallen their brethren in the Punjab proper, united in 1808 in an application for aid to the British Government. Our authorities, who were then engaged in negotiations with Ranjit Singh, accepted the proffered protectorate. The treaty of 1809 secured them from encroachment on the north; while a proclamation, issued in 1811, put an end to those internal wars which had previously wasted the energies of the various States. With this exception, however, the Chiefs still retained sovereign rights within their several principalities, having absolute civil, criminal, and fiscal jurisdiction, subject only to the supreme authority of the British Government. No tribute was demanded, and no contingent fixed; the only claim which the British advanced, in return for their protection, was the right to escheats, and to assistance in case of war. But after the outbreak of the first Sikh war, and during the Sutlej campaign of 1845, the chieftains failed to supply the stipulated military aid. At the conclusion of the war, the British Government accordingly resolved to place the jurisdiction of the Cis-Sutlej principalities upon an entirely new basis. The chieftains had in many cases exhibited an incapacity for just rule, so that it had become desirable in the interests of their subjects to check their fiscal exactions, and place the administration of justice in stronger hands. By a resolution, dated November 17, 1846, the Governor-General abolished the criminal jurisdiction of the chieftains, removed the internal transit or customs duties, and laid down a scale of tribute in commutation of the military service which the chiefs had neglected to perform. Pati\u00e1la, Jind, N\u00e1bha, Far\u00eddkot, Maler Kotl\u00e1\nChitrauli, R\u00e1ikot, Buriy\u00e1, and Mandot obtained exemption from this arrangement; but all the other principalities were incorporated into a British Commissionership of the Cis-Sutlej States, with its head-quarters at Amb\u00e1l\u00e1. It soon became apparent, however, that the petty Chiefs, deprived of their police jurisdiction, could not efficiently collect their revenue, and steps were taken for a regular assessment of the land under British officials; which measure, though temporarily postponed by the outbreak of the second Sikh war, was fully carried out after the completion of that campaign and the resulting annexation of the Punjab. In June 1849, accordingly, the British Government finally abolished the sovereign powers of the petty chieftains, and assumed the complete criminal, civil, and fiscal authority throughout all the States, except the eight above enumerated. The whole administration devolved upon our newly-formed Government at Lahore; and though the revenues still belonged to the various chieftains, the task of assessment and collection fell upon the British officials. Since that date, various other States have lapsed from time to time, by death or forfeiture, to the British Government, and have been incorporated with one or other of the different Districts. For further details and statistics, vide the Districts of AMBALA, LUDHIANA, FIROZPUR (FEROZEPORE), and HISSAR, and the Native States of PATIALA, JIND, and NABHA.\n\nClosepet.\u2014T\u00e1luk in Bangalore District, Mysore State.

The municipality includes the older town of Jagan\u00e1dhapur (formerly a Dutch settlement, made over to the British in 1825), which is connected with Cocan\u00e1da proper by an iron bridge across the tidal creek.\n\nThe returns for 1881\u201382 show that shipping of 703,264 tons burthen entered during the year; value of exports, \u00a3217,331\u2014of imports, \u00a31,225,533. Principal export to Europe, cotton\u2014grown in God\u00e1var\u00ed and Kistna Districts, pressed at Gant\u00far (Guntoor), and brought to Cocan\u00e1da by canals; oil-seeds, sugar, and rice are also exported. The trade is carried on by English, French, and native coasting vessels. The cotton traffic received a great impetus during the American war, this port being more convenient for large shipments than Masulipatam. The chief imports are iron, copper, sacks, and liquor. The roadstead is one of the safest on this dangerous coast, but the anchorage is gradually shifting owing to the silting up of the bay. A new lighthouse was erected on the mainland, 4\u00be miles from Cocon\u00e1da, in 1879, the old one, erected in 1865, having become almost useless, owing to the shifting of the shoals.\u2014See
