UI\n\nPROFESSOR IN THE S\u014cT\u014cSHU COLLEGE, TOKYO,\n\nEDITED BY\n\nF. W. THOMAS\n\nLONDON:\nROYAL ASIATIC SOCIETY,\n22 ALBEMARLE STREET.\n\n1917\nPREFACE\n\nThe Vai\u015be\u1e63ika philosophy has not hitherto been much studied, though it seems to deserve a thorough investigation. As regards its scope, it differs considerably in many respects from the metaphysical systems of the S\u0101\u1e41khya and the Ved\u0101nta, and its epistemological basis, natural philosophy, and consequently its mechanical view are more consistently elaborated than might be expected in a school of ancient Indian philosophy. The present little work does not attempt, as will be apparent, to give a systematic and exhaustive exposition of all the theories of the school; but I have tried, in the course of my explanations of the translation, to expound some fundamental and characteristic thoughts, where they might be helpful in the understanding of passages. The work is, however, designed primarily not for scholars, but for beginners, in view of whom the bulk of the Introduction and the Notes has been written.\n\nI am fully aware of many imperfections. In particular, I ought to say that the statements concerning the origin and development of the Ny\u0101ya reasoning (pp. 82-4, \u00a7 2) are according to my subsequent investigations not correct. It is hoped that the reader will not attach importance to the passage, which fortunately is not essential to the main purpose of the Introduction.\n\nDr. F. W. Thomas has kindly corrected my English, and his rigorous criticism has detected throughout the work many of my oversights. He has also helped me in all matters connected with the reading of the proofs, the subject, the arrangement, and the form. But no changes have been made without my assent, and I retain a full responsibility for all the features of the work. For a kindness which is too great to particularize or\nto repay, and without which the work could not have come into existence, I owe my most sincere thanks.\n\nA special debt of gratitude is also due to Professor Garbe and Professor Takakusu, to whose instruction I owe a part of the material used in the Introduction, and to Professor de la Vall\u00e9e Poussin, Professor Macdonell, Miss Hughes, and Mr. E. J. Thomas, who have been kind to me in many ways.\n\nHAKUJU UI.\n\nCambridge.\nMay, 1917.\n## Table of Contents\n\n### Introduction\n\nI. The Treatise, 1\u20132.\n\nII. Kwhei-ci, 2\u20133.\n\nIII.

The Treatise\n\nAmong the huge collection of the Buddhist tripi\u1e6daka in the Chinese translation we have only two distinct works of other systems than Buddhism. The one is the S\u0101\u1e45khya-k\u0101rik\u0101 with a commentary, and the other is a Vai\u015be\u1e63ika treatise without a commentary. The former has been translated into French by Professor Takakusu, and the latter is represented by the present work.\n\nThe title of the treatise is in Chinese Sh\u0101n-tsu\u1e47\u00b9-shi-ch\u016b-i-lun\u00b2 and in Sanskrit Vai\u015be\u1e63ika-(nik\u0101ya-)da\u015bapada-rtha-\u015b\u0101stra\u00b3, i.e. a treatise on the ten categories of the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika. It was composed by a follower of the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika, and translated into Chinese by Yuan Chwang (Hh\u00fcen-Cw\u00e4n) in 648 A.D.\n\nA tradition says that Kwh\u0113i-ci,\u2074 a famous disciple of Yuan Chwang, commented on the treatise; but this is perhaps a mistake. Yuan Chwang translated a great many Sanskrit works into Chinese; but his main effort appears to have been devoted to the translation of the works of the Sarv\u0101sti-v\u0101da, especially the Abhidharma-ko\u015ba-\u015b\u0101stra,\u2075 and of the Vij\u00f1\u0101na-v\u0101da, especially the\n\n\u00b9 Tsu\u1e47 or tsung. The pronunciations of the Chinese characters are taken principally from Nanjio's Catalogue and Giles' Dictionary.\n\u00b2 In Japanese Sh\u014d-sh\u016b-ji-k-ku-gi-ron, sometimes called Jikkugiron. Copies exist in the Bodleian Library (Jap. 65, Y, 10, pp. 72b-75b) and in the Library of the India Office (case 64b, pp. 1a-13b).\n\u00b3 Nanjio, Catalogue of the Chinese Tripitaka, No. 1295. Nik\u0101ya is probably superfluous.\n\u2074 In Japanese Ki-ki, usually called Ji-on, or Jion-daishi-kiki (632-82 A.D.). He is a great commentator and the first patriarch of the F\u0101-hsiang-tsung (the Hoss\u014d-sh\u016b or -ji\u016b), a sect of the followers of the Vij\u00f1\u0101na-v\u0101da in China and Japan.\n\u2075 No. 1269.\nVijnapti-matrata-siddhi-sastra.\\(^1\\) His disciples were divided principally between the two schools.\n\nII. Kwhei-ci\n\nKwhei-ci is the orthodox propagator of the Vijnanavada and the authority on the second work. This is a commentary on Vasu-bandhu's Vijnapti-matrata-trimsatkarika,\\(^2\\) which is a highly authoritative exposition of the Vijnanavada and had ten commentaries by as many different Indian authors. Yuan Chwang first translated the ten commentaries, but he afterwards amalgamated them with the commentary by Dharma-pala, the teacher of his teacher, Sila-bhadra. This second work, the Vijnapti-matrata-siddhi-sastra, is ascribed chiefly to Dharma-pala, and is the fundamental work of the Fa-hsiang-tsung. Kwhei-ci commented on the work.\\(^3\\) Dharma-pala's work adopts an idealistic standpoint in epistemology and metaphysics, and refutes the realistic systems, the Sankhya, the Vaishesika, other minor schools, and the Hina-yana Buddhism. The Vaishesika in this work represents the doctrines of the six categories, and seems to have been quoted by Dharma-pala himself, because his refutations agree with those in another work by him.\\(^4\\) Kwhei-ci, commenting on the passage concerning the Vaishesika, quotes and paraphrases the treatise, although the latter exhibits ten categories, under the three headings, the enumeration of the ten categories and the subdivisions,\n\n\\(^1\\) No. 1197. As for the term vijnapti-matrata, see the Bodhicaryavatara (Professor de la Vall\u00e9e Poussin, Bouddhisme, London, 1898, p. 271, \"... citta-matre 'pi vijnapti-matravyam api ...\"). I owe the Sanskrit term to Professor de la Vall\u00e9e Poussin. See Lokatattva-niraya (\"vijnaptimatrani sunya ceti sakasya niscayah\") of Hari-bhadra (Giorn. d. Soc. Asiat. ital., 1905, pp. 279, 283-4).\n\n\\(^2\\) No. 1215.\n\n\\(^3\\) Dainihon-zoku-zoky\u014d, 77, bk. 1 ff. A copy is kept in the British Museum. Kwhei-ci's quotations and paraphrasing are found on pp. 29a-40a.\n\n\\(^4\\) That is, No. 1198, a commentary on Deva's Sata-sastra-raipulya (No. 1189). Some passages are translated in this Introduction.\nthe definitions of them, and the relations among them, that is, the first and a portion of the second chapter of the treatise. This was, perhaps, taken for a commentary on the treatise. Kwh\u0113i-ci's quotations are useful for understanding the treatise, so that they are freely used in the following notes, where necessary.\n\nIII. The Founder of the System\n\nKwh\u0113i-ci mentions some traditional accounts concerning the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika and its founder in the above commentary and in his commentary on \u015aa\u1e45kara-sv\u0101min's Hetu-vidy\u0101-ny\u0101ya-prave\u015ba-\u015b\u0101stra.\u00b9 The traditions in the two commentaries are essentially the same, and may be supposed to have their origin in India, because he has probably put down what he had heard from Yuan Chwang.\n\nBefore Yuan Chwang, Kum\u0101ra-j\u012bva translated Deva's \u015a\u0101ta-\u015b\u0101stra\u00b2 into Chinese, together with the commentary by the Bodhi-sattva Vasu. The \u015a\u0101ta-\u015b\u0101stra contains, in many passages, refutations of the S\u0101\u1e45khya and the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika, etc. The work was also commented upon by a Chinese Buddhist, Ci-ts\u0101n (549\u2013623 A.D.).\u00b3 Ci-ts\u0101n's commentary relates the following traditions with regard to the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika and its founder:\n\n\u201c(The founder\u2019s name) Ul\u016bka means an \u2018owl\u2019... The time when he lived was 800 years before the Buddha. By day he composed a work and by night he wandered about for alms... The s\u016btra composed by him is called the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika(-s\u016btra) and consists of 100,000 \u015blokas. The main tenets are the doctrines of the six categories, of\n\n\u00b9 No. 1216. Kwh\u0113i-ci's commentary is in the Dainihon-zoku-z\u014dky\u014d, 86, bk. 4, pp. 346 ff.\n\u00b2 No. 1188. Kum\u0101ra-j\u012bva arrived in China (Ch\u0101i-an) in 401 A.D. and died c. 413, at the age of 74 years. He was the chief translator of the works of the \u015a\u016bnya-v\u0101da. See Nanjio, Cat., App. ii, 59.\n\u00b3 In Japanese Ki-chi-z\u014d, or Kaj\u014d-daishi-kichiz\u014d. His commentary is in the Dainihon-zoku-z\u014dky\u014d, 78, bk. 5, and 87, bk. 2.\nthe *asat-k\u0101rya-v\u0101da*, and that self (*\u0101tman*) is something different from cognition (*buddhi*).\u00b9\n\nIn another passage he states:\n\n\"According to the *Life* of Hari-varman, there lived a follower of Ul\u016bka (at the time of Hari-varman, c. 260 A.D.). He said that the *s\u016btra* composed by our teacher, Ul\u016bka, is named the *Vai\u015be\u1e63ika*-(*s\u016btra*), and is subtle or scholastic. Its general tenet is the doctrines of the six categories, and the speciality is that cognition is something different from self. If anyone could defeat me in disputation, I should kill myself for apology.\"\u00b2 This is a little similar to the statement of the present text. Ul\u016bka's opinion of self evidently shows that he lived when the S\u0101mkhya had been systematized, and that he founded another system, because he had discovered, as is affirmed, the imperfection of the S\u0101mkhya.\u00b3 *Vai\u015be\u1e63ika*, the name of the *s\u016btra*, means superior, or excellent, and distinguished (or different). The origin of the name is in the fact that the system is distinguished from, and superior to, the S\u0101mkhya.\"\u2074\n\n\u00b9 Ibid., bk. 5, p. 282a. The source of his traditions is not clearly known. Ci-ts\u0101n in his boyhood, when he had not yet become a Buddhist, saw Param\u0101rtha accompanied by his father. Param\u0101rtha arrived in China in 548 A.D. and died in 569 A.D. (499-569). See Nanjio, *Cat.*, App. ii, 104-5. Ci-ts\u0101n seems not to have been instructed by Param\u0101rtha even afterwards. Param\u0101rtha was an eminent scholar of the Vij\u00f1\u0101na-v\u0101da and of the *Abhidharma-kosa-s\u016btra*, while Ci-ts\u0101n was a distinguished propagator of the \u015a\u016bnya-v\u0101da in China, and restored the S\u0101n-lun-tsong (the San-ron-sh\u016b, or -ji\u016b).\n\n\u00b2 This means the S\u0101mkhya doctrine of self (*puru\u1e63a*), that is nothing but cognition (*cit*, *cetana*, or *j\u00f1a*).\n\n\u00b3 *Dainihon-zoku-z\u014dky\u014d*, 87, bk. 2, p. 103a. The latter part of his account is also found in 73, bk. 5, p. 384b. The *Life* of Hari-varman was composed by Yuan Ch'ang (Gen-ch\u014d) about 450 A.D., and is preserved in the *Chu-s\u014dn-ts\u0101n-ci-tsi* (No. 1476), vol. xii, pp. 63b-64a, which was compiled by San-yiu (S\u014d-y\u016b) about 520 A.D.\n\nAccording to the original text, Hari-varman lived in the 900th year after the Buddha's Nirv\u0101\u1e47a (A.D.). The follower of Ul\u016bka surpassed others in disputation. Having heard that the king of Magadha favoured Buddhists, he went to P\u0101\u1e6dali-putra and asked the king to be\nIt can hardly be ascertained what authority these traditions have, except the extract from the *Life* of Hari-varman. Nevertheless, the whole material was not invented by the commentator, because his account agrees in some respects with Kwh\u0113i-ci. Kwh\u0113i-ci states:\n\n\"About the end of the time of the creation (*sr\u1e63\u1e6di*), when the age of creatures was immeasurable, a teacher (*t\u012brthaka*) came to the world. He was named Ul\u016bka. Ul\u016bka means an 'owl'. In the daytime he meditated in a dense forest, secluding himself from worldly affairs, and at night, when people went to rest, he wandered about for food. This mode of living was very similar to that of an owl, so that he got the name Ul\u016bka. He was also called Ka\u1e47a-bhuj or Ka\u1e47a-bhak\u1e63a. Ka\u1e47a means 'a grain (or a piece) of (rice-)corn', and bhuj or bhak\u1e63a means 'to eat'. The origin of the name was that he was usually wandering about at night, but as young women were frightened by the sight of him he afterwards went in secret into mills, picked up pieces of corn from rice-bran, and ate them. He was, consequently, nicknamed the 'corn-piece-eater'. He was further called (the teacher of) the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika. Vai\u015be\u1e63ika means 'superior' or 'excellent' (literally, 'conquering'). He composed a work explaining the six categories. The work was named the *Vai\u015be\u1e63ika(-\u015b\u0101stra)*, since it excelled other works in all respects, or because it was composed by a man of superior intelligence. As he was the master and the composer of the *Vai\u015be\u1e63ika(-\u015b\u0101stra)*, he was called the teacher of the *Vai\u015be\u1e63ika(-\u015b\u0101stra).*\"\n\nallowed to enter into disputation with Buddhists. Hari-varman was elected to dispute with him, etc.\n\nAccording to another tradition, Hari-varman had been a follower of the S\u0101\u1e45khya before he became a Buddhist. He introduced some doctrines of the S\u0101\u1e45khya into his own work, the *Satya-siddhi-\u015b\u0101stra*.\n\n1 *Dainihon-zoku-z\u014dky\u014d*, 77, bk. 1, pp. 39a\u201340a, and 86, bk. 4, p. 371b. Cf. *Ny\u0101ya-ko\u015ba* (Bombay S.S., No. xlix, 2nd ed.), p. 743.\nKwh\u0113i-\u010di also calls the founder Ka\u1e47\u0101da; but to the Chinese traditions it is not known that Ka\u1e47\u0101da or Ka\u1e47a-\nbhuj means \"atom-eater\", and the meaning of the term Vai\u015be\u1e63ika is \"superior\" or \"excellent\".\n\n\"Atom-eater,\" as the nickname of the founder, might not be probable, because an atomic theory is not special\nto the system, and the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika is not the first pioneer of the theory.\\(^1\\) \"Superior\" or \"excellent\" is a secondary\nmeaning of the term, and the term is not used in this sense in V.S.\\(^2\\) The explanation of the name Vai\u015be\u1e63ika\nthat it was derived from the fifth category particularity (vi\u015be\u1e63a), or the characteristic of the system that an object\nis precisely analysed and classified, is more probable.\nAnd the above explanation of Ul\u016bka is different from\nthat of Indian commentators. R\u0101ja-\u015bekhara, in his\nNy\u0101ya-kandal\u012b-\u1e6d\u012bk\u0101, explains that Ka\u1e47\u0101da was favoured\nby \u012a\u015bvara on account of the merit of his ardent ascetic\npractice. \u012a\u015bvara appeared to him as Ul\u016bka-r\u016bpa-dh\u0101r\u012b\n(bearing the form of an owl). On that occasion he was\ninstructed by \u012a\u015bvara in the doctrines of the six categories.\\(^3\\)\nBut \u012a\u015bvara is not mentioned in V.S., although later\ncommentators strain the meaning of some passages.\\(^4\\)\nPra\u015basta-p\u0101da acknowledged \u012a\u015bvara for the first time in\nthe history of the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika. Consequently the tradition\nmust have been originated in a time later than Pra\u015basta-\np\u0101da, who lived in the fifth or sixth century A.D. The\nChinese traditional explanation of Ul\u016bka seems to have\nbeen derived from an etymological meaning of the term,\nbut it represents an older tradition. Even A\u015bva-gho\u1e63a\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) But in later times the atomic theory is considered as a special\ndoctrine of the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika (Brahma-s\u016btra, ii, 2, 11 ff.), and the system\nis called the Pailuka.

Kwh\u0113i-ci further says:\u2014\n\n\"After having attained the five sorts of siddhi\\footnote{Divya-cak\u1e63us, divya-\u015brotra, para-citta-j\u00f1\u0101na, p\u016brva-niv\u0101s\u0101num\u1e5bti-j\u00f1\u0101na, and rddhi-vidhi-j\u00f1\u0101na.} (perfection), the Pesi (sage) Ul\u016bka desired to enter into Nirv\u0101\u1e47a; but he regretted that he was not able to have a disciple and to hand down the doctrines of the six categories . . . At last (after innumerable years) he found one named Pa\u00f1ca-sikhi (or -in). Pa\u00f1ca-sikhi was born in a family of Br\u0101hma\u1e47as in V\u0101r\u0101\u1e47asi; his father's name was M\u0101navaka. M\u0101navaka means a 'boy' or a 'youth'. After a long, long time (9,000 years) Ul\u016bka took Pa\u00f1ca-sikhi into his hermitage and instructed him in the six categories, i.e. substance, attribute, action, existence (satt\u0101 or bh\u0101va), universality-particularity (s\u0101m\u0101nya-vi\u1e63e\u1e63a),\\footnote{This will be explained later on.} and inherence.\"\\footnote{This is an extract from his statement in 77, bk. 1, p. 29a f., and 86, bk. 4, p. 388b. The exaggeration of numbering is a general peculiarity of Chinese and Indian traditions.}\n\nIV. PANCA-SIKHI\n\nAccording to another statement of Kwh\u0113i-ci:\u2014\n\n\"Pa\u00f1ca-sikhi accepted the doctrines of the categories, substance, attribute, and action, but he did not follow the doctrine of existence. Kan\u0101da explained that existence is that which inheres in substances, etc., and has reality apart from substances, attributes, and actions; it is one and eternal. Pa\u00f1ca-sikhi rejoined that the existing of substances, attributes, and actions is nothing but existence; there cannot be such existence as to be something different from the three categories and to make them...\"\nexistent. Ka\u1e47\u0101da left the explanation for a while and proceeded to explain the category universality-particularity . . . ,\u00b9 and the category inherence, which is one and eternal. Pa\u00f1ca-\u015bikhi accepted these two categories, except existence. Ka\u1e47\u0101da then framed the following syllogistic proof: \u2018Existence is neither a substance, nor an attribute, nor an action . . .\u2019\u00b2 Upon this proof Pa\u00f1ca-\u015bikhi accepted the theory of existence. After that Ka\u1e47\u0101da died, and the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika was promulgated by Pa\u00f1ca-\u015bikhi.\u2019\u00b3\n\nThe tradition asserts that Pa\u00f1ca-\u015bikhi was the disciple of Ka\u1e47\u0101da. The first statement of the above two is very similar to the tradition of \u0100suri, a follower of the S\u0101\u1e45khya.\u2074 According to the Mah\u0101-bh\u0101rata and other S\u0101\u1e45khya writings Asuri had a disciple named Pa\u00f1ca-\u015bikha.\u2075 There must have been many persons whose name was Pa\u00f1ca-\u015bikhi, or Pa\u00f1ca-\u015bikha, and Pa\u00f1ca-\u015bikhi might be a different person from Pa\u00f1ca-\u015bikha, a follower of the S\u0101\u1e45khya. Consequently Pa\u00f1ca-\u015bikhi, a follower of the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika, should not be denied on the simple ground that the name is almost the same. But the tradition was, it is obvious, confused with that of \u0100suri. Unless we should get other evidence concerning Pa\u00f1ca-\u015bikhi, we cannot accept it as it is. Besides, such a syllogistic proof was not used at such an early time. Kwh\u0113i-ci further says in the same commentary that the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika was divided into eighteen schools after Pa\u00f1ca-\u015bikhi, just like the eighteen schools of the S\u0101\u1e45khya. The reference to the S\u0101\u1e45khya proves that the tradition was confused with, or taken from, that of the S\u0101\u1e45khya. Even the eighteen schools\n\n\u00b9 Fully quoted in notes on ch. i, 10.\n\u00b2 Quoted in the following introduction.\n\u00b3 Loc. cit., p. 388b.\n\u2074 See the introductory comment on the S\u0101\u1e45khya-k\u0101rik\u0101, v. 1, in the Chinese translation.

According to the commentary on S.k., v. 70 in the Chinese translation, the successors of Kapila are thus: Kapila\u2014\u0100suri\u2014Pa\u00f1ca-\u015bikha\u2014G\u0101rgya\u2014Ul\u016bka.\nof the S\u0101\u1e41khya are not ascertained. It is, however, known that there were, in the course of time, many different opinions in both systems.\n\nV. The Author\n\nAccording to Kwh\u0113i-c\u012b\u2019s statement, a later follower of the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika, or an eminent teacher among the teachers of the eighteen schools, was Chan-t\u0101-lo. Chan-t\u0101-lo is rendered in Chinese by Huwui-yuah, literally \u201cWisdom-moon\u201d. He wrote the Shi-c\u016b-i-lun (Da\u015ba-pad\u0101rtha-s\u016btra).\u00b9\n\nThis is the present author. Chan-t\u0101-lo is the transliteration of Candra in Sanskrit. Candra, as the original of \u201cWisdom-moon\u201d, seems to show an omission. Later commentators give the full name, \u201cChan-t\u0101-(lo-)mo-ti (Candra - mati),\u201d but Mati-candra\u00b2 is preferable to Candra-mati.\n\nHe has an epithet, Sha\u1e45-c\u014d, before his name. Sha\u1e45-c\u014d literally means \u201can excellent teacher\u201d or \u201ca conqueror\u201d, and may be the translation of Vai\u015be\u1e63ika in the sense of a follower or a teacher of the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika. \u201cAn excellent teacher\u201d (or \u201ca conqueror\u201d) as an epithet can be applied to any other eminent teacher, and does not especially denote a follower of a definite system. In this case the term \u201cexcellent\u201d or \u201csuperior\u201d, as the translation of Vai\u015be\u1e63ika, may also not be preferable.\n\nThe life of the author is not known from Kwh\u0113i-c\u012b\u2019s statement, and the time when he lived is uncertain. But Dharma-p\u0101la\u2019s refutation of the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika is directed against the doctrines of the six categories as stated above. If this fact implies that the author is later than\n\n\u00b9 Loc. cit., pp. 296, 376b.\n\u00b2 Cf. R\u0101jendral\u0101l\u0101 Mitra, Notices of Skt. MSS. (Calcutta, 1886), vol. viii, pp. 80\u20131; Bhandarkar, A Catalogue of the Collections of MSS. (Bombay, 1888), p. 61; Hara-pras\u0101d S\u0101stri, Notices of Skt. MSS., vol. x, p. 149.\nDharmap\u0101la, his date is between Dharma-p\u0101la and Yuan Chwang.\n\nAccording to Yuan Chwang's *Si-y\u00fc-ci* \u015a\u012bla-bhadra was, when he was studying with Dharma-p\u0101la, 30 years old, and he was 106 years old when Yuan Chwang met him. Yuan Chwang started from China in 629 A.D., and arrived at R\u0101ja-grha, and saw him in 633 A.D. So Dharma-p\u0101la was still living in 557 A.D. Consequently the *terminus a quo* of Mati-candra is 550 A.D., and the *terminus ad quem* is 640 A.D. This date is also confirmed by that of Pra\u015basta-p\u0101da. Pra\u015basta-p\u0101da is undoubtedly a predecessor of Mati-candra, and lived in the first half of the sixth century or the latter half of the fifth century, as proved later on. Mati-candra cannot be earlier than the first half of the sixth century.\n\nVI. The Treatise and its Commentaries\n\nThe most obvious characteristic of the treatise is that it acknowledges ten categories, adding the four potentiality (*sakti*), non-potentiality (*asakti*), commonness (*s\u0101m\u0101nya-vi\u1e63e\u1e63a*), and non-existence (*abh\u0101va* or *asat*) to the six in *V.S.* and *Pr. Bh.* The explanations and the source of the four categories will be found in the following translation and notes. And the treatise has no mention of \u012a\u015bvara, as in the case of *V.S.*; there is also no description of the way to emancipation (*mok\u1e63a*); even if the second sort of merit (*dharma*, one of the twenty-four attributes) corresponds to it, it is only a definition of it. As a\n\n---\n\n1 No. 1503, vol. viii, p. 40a.\n2 No. 1493, vol. iv, p. 105b.\n3 No. 1637, vol. xii, p. 84a.\n4 According to Kwh\u0113i-ci's commentary on No. 1197 Dharma-p\u0101la died in the 32nd year of his age, though the tradition is a little different from the Tibetan tradition mentioned in T\u0101ra-n\u0101tha's *Geschichte des Buddhismus* (pp. 161\u20132), which is later and less reliable. And Dharmap\u0101la is said to have been one year younger than \u015a\u012bla-bhadra; hence he lived in 539\u201370 A.D.\n5 This is known from the fact that the treatise bases its explanations upon the *Pra\u015basta-p\u0101da-bh\u0101\u1e63ya* (*Pr. Bh.*) in many passages, as shown in the following notes.\nconsequence, the author does not allude to yoga, yogin, or anything supernatural. The description in general is throughout concise and has no superfluity or digression.\n\nNo commentaries on the treatise were composed by Chinese Buddhists; but later Japanese writers composed the following:\n\n1. *Sh\u014dsh\u016bjikugiron-ki*, 2 vols., by H\u014d-ji\u016b, 1758 A.D.\n2. *Kwach\u016b-sh\u014dsh\u016bjikkugiron*, 1 vol., by Ko-katsu, 1760.\n3. *Kwach\u016b-sh\u014dsh\u016bjikkugiron*, 1 vol., enlarged by Son-ky\u014d.\n4. *Sh\u014dsh\u016bjikugiron-shaku*, 2 vols., by Ki-ben, 1779.\n5. *Sh\u014dsh\u016bjikugiron-shiki*, 2 vols., by Gon-z\u014d, c. 1783.\n6. *Sh\u014dsh\u016bjikugiron-keechaku*, 5 vols., by Kai-d\u014d, 1796.\n7. *Sh\u014dsh\u016bjikugiron-s\u014drin*, 1 vol., by Kai-d\u014d, c. 1796.\n8. *Sh\u014dsh\u016bjikugiron-shaku-b\u014dkwanroku*, 1 vol., by K\u014d-gon, undated, refuting No. 4.\n9. *Jikkugiron-monki*, 1 vol., by H\u014d-un, 1844, depending upon No. 6.\n10. *Jikkugiron-k\u014dgi*, 1 vol., by K\u014d-h\u014d, 1898, paraphrasing No. 6.\u00b9\n\nVII. The Sutras of the Six Systems\n\nThe dates of the founders and the sutras of the six systems have been discussed by eminent scholars; but for the present study the dates of the founders and those of the sutras must be treated as separate problems, because most of the founders are mystical personages and their traditional dates are very vague, while the\n\n\u00b9 These commentaries are rare even in Japan, except Nos. 3, 9, 10. The present writer has been able to consult the last two. No. 6 is said to be the best; but there are many cases of misreading and misunderstanding. All the commentaries depend upon Kwhei-\u010di's paraphrasing and other sub-commentaries on Kwhei-\u010di's commentary, etc. After Kwhei-\u010di the Fa-hsiang-tsung was not much studied; some texts were lost and corrupted. The third patriarch of the sect, C' \u0109eu (Chi-shu, the seventh-eighth century), misunderstood some passages of the treatise owing to the corruptions of the text. These corruptions and misunderstanding caused the mistaken explanations in the above commentaries.\ndates of the s\u016btras cannot possibly be so remote. Jacobi maintains that the Ny\u0101ya-dar\u015bana and the Brahma-s\u016btra were composed between 200 and 500 A.D. The Vai\u015be\u1e63ika-dar\u015bana and the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101-s\u016btra are about as old as, or rather somewhat older than, N.D. and B.S. The Yoga-s\u016btra is later than 450 A.D. and the S\u0101\u1e45khya-s\u016btra is a modern composition.\\(^1\\)\n\nAs a matter of fact, the compilation of the s\u016btras fixes the doctrines of the systems; but before the compilation there must have been, to some extent, a systematization of the doctrines. Therefore, even if the above opinion, which is admirably founded, is quite acceptable, it naturally does not mean that there were no rudiments or no earlier stages of the development of the doctrines. In this sense the traditional founders and the real compilers of the s\u016btras cannot be the same persons. For a historical study the question may be divided into two parts. The question of the founders resolves itself into the question of the origins of the systems, and the dates of the s\u016btras relate to the development of the doctrines. Especially if the study is of another work than the s\u016btra of a system, researches into the historical development are necessary. In the course of the following introduction the present writer will try to study the origin, the systematization, and some aspects of the historical development of the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika. Before entering into the questions some digressions may be permitted.\n\nVIII. THE VAISESIKA SUTRA AND ITS COMMENTARIES\n\nThe historical development of the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika and the Ny\u0101ya has been discussed by Bodas in his introduction to Athalye's edition of the Tarka-samgraha.\\(^2\\) It contains reliable information, and has been quoted by eminent\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) JAOS., vol. xxxi, 1911, p. 29. During that period (200-500) lived the old commentators: V\u0101tsy\u0101yana, Upa-var\u1e63a, the V\u1e5btti-k\u0101ra (Bodh\u0101yana?), and probably Sabara-sv\u0101min.\n\n\\(^2\\) Bombay S.S., No. lv.\nscholars (Max M\u00fcller, Jacobi, and Suali). The Vai\u015be\u1e63ika can be treated from the historical point of view, like other systems; but there is, as Bodas pointed out, a gap in the history between the time of Pra\u015basta-p\u0101da (or Uddyotakara) and that of \u015ar\u012bdhara (991 A.D.). The treatise was produced during that interval, and has not yet been influenced by theories of the Ny\u0101ya. But, having followed Pr. Bh., it differs from V.S. in certain opinions and takes the lead of the modern Vai\u015be\u1e63ika works. The modern Vai\u015be\u1e63ika has, to speak roughly, two sources. The one is Pr. Bh. and the other is N.S. and its Bh\u0101sya by V\u0101tsy\u0101yana. The latter explained some of the Ny\u0101ya theories by the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika and mixed them up, while the former contended for the special theories and in some measure changed the original theories. Some of these special theories were accepted not only by the treatise, but also by the later commentators on V.S.\n\nV.S. had and has at least the following commentaries: R\u0101va\u1e47a-bh\u0101sya,\u00b9 V\u1e5btti,\u00b2 Upask\u0101ra,\u00b3 Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja-v\u1e5btti-bh\u0101sya,\u2074 Viv\u1e5bti,\u2075 and Bh\u0101sya.\u2076\n\n\u015ar\u012bcaran\u0101 in his Prak\u0101\u015b\u0101rtha says that some of the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika doctrines discussed by \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya in his\n\n\u00b9 Pr.

Besides these commentaries there are Raghu-deva\u2019s Vy\u0101khy\u0101na, Candrananda\u2019s Bh\u0101sya, Bh\u0101sya-ratna, and T\u012bk\u0101 (Aufrecht\u2019s Cat. Cat., iii, p. 128, and H\u1e5b\u1e63ik\u0113\u015ba S\u0101stri\u2019s Cat., iii, No. 369). Candrananda\u2019s Bh\u0101sya is said by Kiellhorn to be complete, while the other three are incomplete. It is not known whether they are good commentaries or not. As to the first and the second in Aufrecht\u2019s Cat. Cat., i, p. 615, it cannot be ascertained whether they are really commentaries on the s\u016btra. Cf. Oppert\u2019s Lists, ii, p. 62, No. 1041. Pr. Bh. is not a commentary on V.S., and it is called the Pad\u0101rtha-dharma-samgraha.\nBrahma-s\u016btra-bh\u0101\u1e63ya represent an older school and agree with Pr. Bh., but they are not in harmony with the R\u0101va\u1e47a-bh\u0101\u1e63ya. Consequently R\u0101va\u1e47a is seen to have been later than Pra\u015basta-p\u0101da.\u00b9 Nothing more can as yet be found concerning R\u0101va\u1e47a.\n\nThe V\u1e5btti is quoted by the Upask\u0101ra about eight times.\u00b2 It may, according to some writers, be that which is sometimes called the Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja-v\u1e5btti and ascribed to Uddyotakara, simply because Uddyota-kara is Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja.\u00b3 And some writers maintain that the V\u1e5btti or the Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja-v\u1e5btti is the text of the Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja-v\u1e5btti-bh\u0101\u1e63ya. But when the V\u1e5btti in the Upask\u0101ra is compared with the latter, none of the corresponding passages agree. V.S. 6, 1, 5\u2074 and 6, 1, 12 are not found in the Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja-v\u1e5btti-bh\u0101\u1e63ya. The Upask\u0101ra's reference on V.S. 7, 1, 3 to the V\u1e5btti-k\u0101ra is entirely at variance with the Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja-v\u1e5btti-bh\u0101\u1e63ya. According to the Upask\u0101ra the V\u1e5btti-k\u0101ra explains the s\u016btra 7, 1, 3, etena nitye\u1e63u nityatvam uktam, thus: nitye\u1e63v-anityatvam uktam; but the corresponding s\u016btra in the Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja-v\u1e5btti-bh\u0101\u1e63ya runs etena nitye\u1e63u nity\u0101 ukt\u0101\u1e25.\u2075 The conclusion from these comparisons is that neither the Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja-v\u1e5btti-bh\u0101\u1e63ya nor the Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja-v\u1e5btti,\u2076 if the former is a Bh\u0101\u1e63ya on the latter, nor the s\u016btras in them can be the same as the V\u1e5btti or the s\u016btras in it.

About eighteen s\u016btras are added, while about seventy-six are omitted.\\(^1\\) The s\u016btra 2, 1, 14 has the term param\u0101\u1e47u, which is not used in V.S. in the other commentaries, and 1, 2, 13 was evidently derived from Pr. Bh.\\(^2\\) Besides, the explanations are much influenced by the S\u0101mkhya and are not reliable.\n\nThe Upask\u0101ra is an acknowledged commentary; but the explanations generally depend upon Pr. Bh. and are sometimes too far-fetched.\\(^3\\) The author lived about 1650 A.D.\n\nThe Viv\u1e5bti principally bases its explanations upon, and paraphrases, the Upask\u0101ra, although the author in some passages expresses disapproval of it.\\(^4\\)\n\nThe Bh\u0101sya of Candra-k\u0101nta may claim to be regarded as a better commentary than others, though sometimes too short. But in some passages the Bh\u0101sya depends upon the Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja-v\u1e5btti-bh\u0101sya and is not correct.\\(^5\\)\n\nThe R\u0101va\u1e47a-bh\u0101sya, as opposed to Pr. Bh., may seem to be very close to the original meaning of V.S.; but this is not exactly the case, because Udayana's Kir\u0101\u1e47\u0101val\u012b, a commentary on Pr. Bh., depending upon the R\u0101va\u1e47a-bh\u0101sya,\\(^6\\) differs in some opinions from the author of V.S. Also the V\u1e5btti seems to have been affected by N.S., especially in commenting on 1, 2, 6 and 3, 1, 17. Consequently we see that V.S. cannot have had a good commentator like V\u0101tsy\u0101yana on N.S., and was explained\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Even the corresponding s\u016btras sometimes do not agree with the s\u016btras in the other commentaries.\n\n\\(^2\\) pp. 14 and 324.

VAI\u015aE\u1e62IKA AND NYAYA\n\nAfter the compilation of V.S. the author of N.S. introduced its doctrines into his own metaphysics. The not doubtful examples are N.S. 3, 1, 36\u00b9 (= V.S. 4, 1, 8) and 2, 1, 54 (essentially the same as V.S. 7, 2, 20). The Bh\u0101sya of V\u0101tsy\u0101yana used many passages from V.S. even as examples of reasoning.\u00b2\n\nThe date of N.S. seems to be between N\u0101g\u0101rjuna (the second\u2013third century) and Vasu-bandhu (the fourth century).\u00b3\n\nV\u0101tsy\u0101yana had a predecessor in commenting on N.S.\u2074 and calls the author a \u1e5b\u1e63i,\u2075 which proves that some time elapsed between the author and V\u0101tsy\u0101yana. V\u0101tsy\u0101yana was attacked by Dig-n\u0101ga. Dig-n\u0101ga\u2019s works were, for the first time, translated into Chinese in 557\u201369 by Param\u0101rtha.\u2076 Dig-n\u0101ga must have lived at the latest in the fifth or sixth century, probably in the middle (or the\n\n\u00b9 This s\u016btra has already been pointed out by Windisch in his \u00dcber das Ny\u0101ya-bh\u0101sya (Leipzig, 1888). The s\u016btra is not found in Vi\u015bva-n\u0101tha\u2019s Vy\u0101ti; but Uddyota-kara\u2019s Ny\u0101ya-v\u0101rttika and V\u0101caspati-mi\u015bra\u2019s Ny\u0101ya-s\u016bci-nilbandha, upon the latter of which the Vy\u0101ti depends, reckon it as a s\u016btra of N.S. Besides, compare N.S. 3, 1, 28 with V.S. 4, 2, 3; N.S. 3, 1, 35 with V.S. 4, 1, 6\u201313; N.S. 3, 1, 63 with V.S. 8, 2, 4\u20135; N.S. 3, 1, 71 with V.S. 8, 2, 5; N.S. 3, 2, 63 with V.S. 7, 1, 23; and N.S. 1, 1, 10 with V.S. 3, 2, 4.\n\n\u00b2 According to Jacobi V.S. 4, 1, 6 is quoted by the Bh\u0101sya on N.S. 3, 1, 33 and 3, 1, 69, and V.S. 3, 1, 16 by the Bh\u0101sya on 2, 2, 36. Besides, as the example of the second explanation of \u015be\u1e63avat of N.S. 1, 1, 5, V.S. 1, 1, 8 (or 2, 2, 22); 2, 2, 23; 2, 2, 31; 2, 1, 27 are freely used, and even in other passages of the Bh\u0101sya there are contained Vai\u015be\u1e63ika theories. The Bh\u0101sya on 1, 1, 9 asserts that the six categories of the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika are prameya. This assertion is followed by later writers.\n\n\u00b3 V.

Hence V\u0101tsy\u0101yana is inferred to have lived in the latter half of the fourth century, or in the first half of the fifth century.\n\nDig-n\u0101ga was attacked by Uddyota-kara, and his logic was followed by Pra\u015basta-p\u0101da. Pra\u015basta-p\u0101da is earlier than, or a contemporary of, Uddyota-kara, because Uddyota-kara alludes to Pr. Bh. Uddyota-kara is said to have been answered by Dharma-k\u012brti, who was referred to by Kum\u0101rila-bha\u1e6d\u1e6da and \u015a\u0101lika-n\u0101tha, a disciple of Prabh\u0101-kara. These teachers were answered by Dharmottara; Dharmottara was criticized by \u015aridhara (991 A.D.).\n\nDharma-k\u012brti is not mentioned by Yuan Chwang (travelled through India 629\u201345), but he is spoken of by I-tsing (671\u201395). Consequently Dharma-k\u012brti\u2019s palmy days were in 645\u201371, and he was, according to the Tibetan tradition, a contemporary of Kum\u0101rila-bha\u1e6d\u1e6da, who was earlier than \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya (c. the eighth century).\n\n---\n\n1 V. Smith, loc. cit., p. 324 (the fifth century).

His date is also proved by the dates of Dharma-p\u0101la (539\u201370), and of Param\u0101rtha (499\u2013569), because the two Buddhists cannot be earlier than Pra\u015basta-p\u0101da. The Vai\u015be\u1e63ika doctrines quoted and refuted by both Buddhists came from Pr. Bh., as proved later on.\n\nAfter N.S. and its Bh\u0101\u1e63ya Pra\u015basta-p\u0101da precisely systematized the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika doctrines; his Bh\u0101\u1e63ya seems to be the first of the pure Vai\u015be\u1e63ika works after V.S., and it is not influenced by the Ny\u0101ya so much as is the case with later Vai\u015be\u1e63ika works.\n\nUddyota-kara, as a successor of V\u0101tsy\u0101yana, used the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika doctrines many times in his Ny\u0101ya-v\u0101rttika, and ascribed the highest authority (paramar\u1e63i) to Ka\u1e47\u0101da.\\(^2\\) Jacobi remarks that \u201cthe fusion of these two schools began early, and seems to have been complete at the time when the Ny\u0101ya-v\u0101rttika was written\u201d.\\(^2\\) The fusion came for the first time from the Ny\u0101ya, and the completeness of the fusion is only on the side of the Ny\u0101ya, because Pr. Bh., as well as the treatise, are not much influenced by the Ny\u0101ya.\n\nX. VAISESIKA TENETS AND THE EARLY SECTS\n\nThe Vai\u015be\u1e63ika is not a materialism in the strict sense of the term, because the system acknowledges other factors besides the four material atoms, and does not reduce the former to the latter; they are all regarded as having the same validity. But there is no doubt that a materialistic\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Cf. Vidy\u0101-bh\u016b\u1e63ana, *Uddyota-kara, a contemporary of Dharma-kirti* (JRAS., 1914, p. 604).\n\n\\(^2\\) Jacobi, *Atomic Theory* (Hastings\u2019 Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics, vol. ii, p. 201b).\ntendency dominates the whole system,\u00b9 and its religious and ethical teaching is to a large extent egoistic and optimistic. This is, perhaps, a consequence of the characteristic of the system so far as it is materialistic.\n\nSuch a materialistic and atomistic tendency is not met with in the ancient Upani\u1e63ads;\u00b2 consequently the origin of the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika would not be traceable in the ancient Upani\u1e63ads or in any other early literature.\n\nAfter the time of the ancient Upani\u1e63ads a great many schools, or rather various opinions, were originated by different teachers. Among them Buddhism and Jainism are the most prominent and influential systems. The canons of both systems agree in describing other minor teachers.\n\nThe Buddhists are wont to designate them the six teachers (t\u012brthaka), P\u016bra\u1e47a Kassapa, Makkhali Gos\u0101la, Ajita Kesa-kambal\u012b, Pakudha Kacc\u0101yana, Niga\u1e47\u1e6dha N\u0101taputta, and Sa\u00f1jaya Velat\u1e6dhi-putta,\u00b3 while the Jainas classify them into the four schools, Kriy\u0101-v\u0101da, Akriy\u0101-v\u0101da, Aj\u00f1\u0101na-v\u0101da, and Vainayika-v\u0101da.\u2074 Heterodox and minor as they are, they have yet an important meaning in the history of Indian philosophy. They represent a general and popular thought of the time outside the orthodox speculations, which were usually confined to the secluded Br\u0101hma\u1e47as. The general tendency of the six teachers is materialistic in metaphysics, and sceptical or a kind of criticism of knowledge in epistemology. We may find the origin of the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika in the thought of these times.\n\nNow, Ajita Kesa-kambali contends that \u201ca human\n\n\u00b9 Cf.

When he dies, the earthy in him returns and relapses to the earth, the fluid to the water, the heat to the fire, the windy to the air, and his faculties (indriy\u0101\u1e47i, the five senses, and the mind as a sixth) pass into space (\u0101k\u0101sa).\u00b9\n\nThe opinion is a real and radical materialism; there is no soul nor any other mental factors, but only the five sorts of materials.\u00b2 Body is the combination of the five elements, and the soul is nothing but body. Ajita Kesakambal\u012b is probably a C\u0101rv\u0101ka.\n\nBut Pakudha Kacc\u0101yana holds that \u201cthe following seven things (k\u0101ya) are neither made nor commanded to be made, neither created nor caused to be created, they are barren (so that nothing is produced out of them) . . . the four elements\u2014earth, water, fire, and air\u2014and ease and pain and the soul (j\u012bva) as a seventh\u201d.\u00b3\n\nThis opinion cannot be designated a materialism, because the soul has an equal position with the other five elements, but it is materialistic. The above two opinions represent the metaphysical aspect of the current opinions of the time; but there is as yet no trace of an atomic theory, because the elements are called mah\u0101-bh\u016bta or k\u0101ya, and the earthy, etc., in a body return to the corresponding elements.

How or by what sort of force they are combined is not explained.\n\nAs a consequence of such a materialistic view, the religious and ethical teaching must be such as \"to him who acts, or causes another to act, mutilates or causes another to mutilate, punishes or causes another to punish, causes grief or torment, trembles or causes others to tremble, kills a living creature, takes what is not given, breaks into houses, commits dacoity or robbery or highway robbery, or tells lies, to him thus acting there is no guilt, . . . no increase of guilt would ensue . . . In generosity, in self-mastery, in control of the senses, in speaking truth, there is neither merit (pu\u00f1\u00f1a), nor increase of merit\";\u00b9 and as \"there is neither slayer nor causer of slaying, hearer or speaker, knower or explainer. When one with a sharp sword cleaves a head in twain, no one thereby deprives anyone of life, a sword has only penetrated into the interval between seven elementary substances\".\u00b2\n\nThe view is held by P\u016bra\u1e47a Kassapa, Ajita Kesakambal\u012b, and Pakudha Kacc\u0101yana. For the materialists merit or any other virtue has no meaning at all; a human being is only a mechanical combination of the five or the eight elements and nothing else. \"There is no such thing as alms or sacrifice or offering. There is neither fruit nor result of good or evil deeds. There is no such thing as this world or next. There is neither father nor mother nor being springing into life without them.\"\u00b3 But it cannot be denied by anyone that there are some enjoying happy circumstances in this life, while others are living miserable lives.

Pakudha Kacc\u0101yana maintains that pleasure (or ease, sukha) and pain (dukkha) are also eternal and are not affected by any other thing. By means of the combination of pleasure and pain with a body and the soul the different circumstances can be produced. The enumeration of the soul, pleasure, and pain shows that the doctrine of Pakudha Kacc\u0101yana is more advanced and speculative than that of Ajita Kesa-kambal\u012b. In this connexion Pakudha Kacc\u0101yana is more similar to the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika than Ajita Kesa-kambal\u012b.\n\nThe opinion concerning pleasure and pain seems to lead to the dogma of transmigration, as in the case of Makkhali Gos\u0101la\u00b9 (the leader of the \u0100jivakas), who holds, however, a kind of fatalism. At any rate the dogma of transmigration required the admission of a certain force, which can answer the question how the elements are combined and how the different circumstances are produced. In the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika the force is called ad\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da (unseen force, destiny).\n\nMakkhali Gos\u0101la\u2019s opinion that \u201cthere is no such thing as power or energy, or human strength or human vigour\u201d seems to have a relation to the opinion of Sa\u00f1jaya Velat\u1e6dhi-putta, who maintains\u2014\u201cIf you ask me whether there is another world (atthi paraloko)\u2014well, if I thought there were, I would say so.

The opinion is of a great importance, and influenced Jainism and Buddhism.\\(^1\\) Mah\u0101-v\u012bra and even Buddha were compelled to provide their teachings and assertions against the scepticism of Sa\u00f1jaya Velatthi-putta, which is essentially a negation of the four modes of expression (atthi, n\u2019atthi, atthi ca n\u2019atthi ca, n\u2019ev\u2019atthi na n\u2019atthi). Negation generally implies a kind of criticism; therefore the consequent development of the above opinion leads to an idealism epistemological and metaphysical, as in the case of the Buddhist view of Nirv\u0101\u1e47a and of the M\u0101dhyamika philosophy of N\u0101g\u0101rjuna.\\(^2\\) Important as the opinion is, it could not be developed so far in the materialistic and realistic schools; but it survives in the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika in the method of studying.\n\nThe above opinions, the Sassata-v\u0101da, the Uccheda-v\u0101da (or the Akriy\u0101-v\u0101da), and the Amar\u0101-Vikkhepa, represent the metaphysics, the ethics, and the theory of knowledge (in a wider sense of the term) of those times.\n\nThe Sassata-v\u0101da is too naive and not philosophic; but, if it is refined and consequently developed, the resultant must be atomistic.

The Buddhist view of the four elements (catt\u0101ri mah\u0101-bh\u016bt\u0101ni) in the R\u016bp\u016bpadh\u0101na-kkhandha, which divides them into two sorts, interior (ajjhattika) and exterior (b\u0101hira), seems to have been an earlier stage of the development to an atomic theory. In those times the Jainas and the \u0100j\u012bvakas maintained an atomic theory, which is most primitive.\n\nJacobi remarks: \"Matter (in Jainism) is an eternal substance, undetermined with regard to quantity and quality, i.e. it may increase or diminish in volume without addition or loss of particles, and it may assume any forms and develop any kind of qualities. Material substances may coalesce into one substance, and one substance may divide into many. Now, the Jains maintain that everything in this world, except souls and mere space, is produced from matter (pudgala), and that all matter consists of atoms (param\u0101\u1e47u). Each atom occupies one point (prade\u015ba) of space. Matter, however, may be either in the gross state (sth\u016bla, b\u0101dara), or in the subtle (s\u016bk\u1e63ma). When it is in the subtle state, innumerable atoms of it occupy the space of one gross atom. The atoms are eternal as regards their substances; each atom has one kind of taste, smell, and colour, and two kinds of touch. These qualities, however, are not permanent and fixed for the several atoms, but they may be changed and developed in them. Two or more atoms which differ in their degree of smoothness and roughness may combine to form aggregates (skandha). The figures formed by the arrangement of the atoms into groups are manifold, and are precisely described in the Bhagavat\u012b:\n\n1 Mah\u0101-ha\u1e6d\u1e6dhi-padopama-sutta (Majjh. N., No. 28), p. 184 f.\n2 Cf. N.S. 2, 2, 18.\n3 The fifth \u0100\u1e45ga (of the Jaina canon), or sometimes called the Viy\u0101ha (or Viv\u0101ha)-pa\u00f1\u00f1atti.\neverything is believed to be formed of groups of one kind only.\\footnote{Cf. V.S. 4, 2, 1-3; 8, 2, 4; N.S. 3, 1, 28.} The atom may develop a motion of its own, and this motion may become so swift that by means of it an atom may traverse in one moment the whole universe from one end to the other.\\footnote{Atomic Theory, pp. 199-200.}\n\nThe atomic theory of Jainism is undoubtedly more speculative than the opinion of Pakudha Kacc\u0101yana; but it may be seen to have a close relation to the latter, or rather both represent the current thought of the time in materialistic and atomistic theories. If these theories are logically developed, they are easily converted into the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika theory. At any rate Pakudha Kacc\u0101yana and the Jainas are probably forerunners of the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika.\n\nThe opinion of Pakudha Kacc\u0101yana is called the Akriy\u0101-v\u0101da, while the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika is called the Kriy\u0101-v\u0101da. Consequently the two are contradictory on this point. Pakudha Kacc\u0101yana maintains, as stated above, that pleasure (sukha) and pain (du\u1e25kha) are eternal and substances (to use the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika's term), just as are the soul and other elements. Therefore, the opinion is named the Akriy\u0101-v\u0101da; but the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika classified them among the attributes of self (the soul) and changed the Akriy\u0101-v\u0101da into the Kriy\u0101-v\u0101da. If the dogma of transmigration is acknowledged, pleasure and pain cannot have a position among substances.\n\nSuch modifications are also found with regard to the Jaina theory. The atomic theory of the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika is, as stated in the following notes, more advanced than that of the Jainas; but the essential points are not changed and the attributes of atoms remain still unfixed. In the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika there are different kinds of atoms corresponding to the four elements, while in Jainism there are not different kinds of atoms. Other modifications in the atomic theory need not be mentioned here. If we\nconsider at what period an atomic theory was introduced into Buddhism, it will be suggestive in this subject.\n\nNow in the P\u0101li Buddhism there is no trace of an atomic theory, as asserted by Franke.\\(^1\\) But in the so-called northern Buddhist literature we can find an early trace of the theory.\n\nDharmottara's *Abhidharma-h\u1e5bdaya-s\u0101stra*\\(^2\\) is of this opinion. His date is said to have been during the Tsin dynasty (221\u2013206 B.C.) and the H\u0101n dynasty (201 B.C.\u20139 A.D.)\\(^3\\) of China. Accordingly he lived about the third\u2013second century B.C. He states:\n\n\"Atoms (*a\u1e47u* or *param\u0101\u1e47u*) in the four sense-organs are of ten kinds; atoms in the body as a sense-organ (i.e. the skin) are of nine kinds, and in the others they are of eight kinds. This number of atoms are restricted to the world possessing smell.\"\\(^4\\)\n\nAccording to the commentaries, the ten kinds of atoms in the eyes are earth, water, fire, wind, colour, smell, taste, touch, the sight-organ (*cak\u1e63ur-indriya*), and the body-(=touch-)organ. In the cases of the other three sense-organs the sight-organ as an atom is replaced by the other three sense-organs as the atoms respectively. The nine kinds in the body are the same as the first nine (the sight-organ and the other three sense-organs are excepted).\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) See Jacobi, *Atomic Theory*, p. 199.\n\n\\(^2\\) No. 1288, translated in 391 A.D. The text consists of 250 \u015blokas; it has been translated with a commentary. Whether the commentary is by the author or not is not clearly known; but it is perhaps by the hand of another, because Dharmottara's text is said to have consisted of only 250 \u015blokas. No. 1294 is another commentary by Upa-s\u0101nta, and No. 1287 is also a commentary by Dharma-tr\u0101ta; but Dharma-tr\u0101ta enlarged the original text and commented with an advanced theory. Dharma-tr\u0101ta's atomic theory is quoted and criticized in the *Abhidharma-mah\u0101-vibh\u016b\u1e63a-s\u0101stra* (No. 1263), vol. cxxvii, p. 5b f., together with the theory of Buddha-deva, and in the *Vibh\u0101\u1e63\u0101-s\u0101stra* (No. 1279), vol. i, p. 8a; vol. vi, p. 6b (the text in the Library of the India Office).\n\n\\(^3\\) Postscript in No. 1287 (*Chu-s\u0101n-tsaun-ci-tsi*, vol. x, p. 59b).

The atoms other than smell and taste are the same in both worlds.\\(^1\\)\n\nIn another passage Dharmottara also states that things in the objective world consist of atoms, while the mental (citta and caitasika) does not consist of atoms. Consequently atoms are material. The meaning of the above quotation may be that there are the eight kinds of atoms in the objective world, and every sense-organ has its own atom; a sense-organ itself is considered as a special atom, because a sense-organ has a special function. The four sense-organs other than the skin partake of the atom of the skin, inasmuch as they occupy a part of the body. Atoms are of thirteen sorts. The view that the atoms of the four elements are different from those of the four qualities is derived from the fact that earth, etc., sometimes have certain qualities owing to mixture with the latter, and sometimes are without them. The commentaries say that atoms are always mixed with one another.\\(^2\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) No. 1288, p. 56a; No. 1294, p. 82b; cf.

The author is said to have lived during the years 200\u2013300 A.D. (No. 1273). But in the latter work the atomic theory was adapted to explain the text. Afterwards the Sarv\u0101st\u012b-v\u0101da (= the Vaibh\u0101\u1e63a school) maintains the atomic theory, and the Sa\u1e41pr\u0101ntika school also follows an atomic theory. Vasu-bandhu's Abhidharma-kosa-s\u0101stra (No. 1269 = No. 1267) holds the theory. In the M\u0101dhyamika school the theory is rejected, while the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra school uses it to explain the process and the state of emanation of the phenomenal world, although the school is idealistic. See Asa\u1e45ga's Yog\u0101c\u0101rya-bh\u016bmi-s\u0101stra (No. 1170), vol. i, p. 48; Mah\u0101y\u0101nabhidharma-samgiti-s\u0101stra\nThe above theory is not yet refined, and does not make distinction between substances and attributes, so that colour, etc., and even the sense-organs, are enumerated as atoms. In some respects Dharmottara's theory is opposed to the Jaina theory. But in the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika colour, etc., are distinguished from earth, etc., and classified among attributes, while the sense-organs are explained as consisting each of a particular one among the four atoms. The Vai\u015be\u1e63ika accepted the atoms of the four elements, and classified the four objects among attributes. Accordingly the above theory appears to represent an earlier stage of the development of the atomic theory, and at the same time to show that an atomistic tendency pervaded the general thought of these times.\n\nAccording to the Uttar\u0101dhayayana Jainism maintains that there are three categories\u2014substance (dravya), quality (gu\u1e47a), and developments (pary\u0101ya). Substances are the substrata of qualities; qualities are inherent in one substance, and developments have the characteristics that they inhere either in substances or in qualities. Substances are six\u2014merit (dharma), demerit (adharma), space, time, matter, and souls; they make up the world. The characteristic of merit is motion, that of demerit immobility; that of space, which contains all other substances, is that it makes room for everything; that of time is duration; that of soul is realization of knowledge, faith,\n\n(No. 1199), vol. i, p. 2a, its commentary, Mah\u0101y\u0101n\u0101bhidharma-sa\u1e41yukta-sa\u1e45g\u012bti-s\u0101stra, by Buddha-simha (compiled by Sthira-mati), (No. 1178), vol. iii, pp. 31a, 39b, and Prakara\u1e47\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47ac\u016b-\u015b\u0101stra (No. 1177), p. 21a.

The characteristic of developments is singleness (\\(ekatva\\)), separateness (\\(prthaktva\\)), number, form, conjunction, and disjunction.\\(^2\\)\n\nUsually in Jainism the categories are divided into two\u2014substance (\\(dravya\\)) and its developments (or modifications, \\(pary\u0101ya\\)). The developments include attributes (\\(gu\u1e47a\\) in the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika), and leave no room for the latter as an independent category. The most important distinction between the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika on the one hand and Jainism, together with the other schools of the time, on the other is that the former strictly distinguishes substance itself from its quality and quantity, while the latter confuses them\\(^3\\) with each other. In these circumstances the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika cannot be earlier than these schools. The Vai\u015be\u1e63ika, developing the principle systematically, elicited its notions of substances and attributes out of the above doctrines of Jainism and the like. And probably actions (\\(karma\\)), too, were derived from the same doctrines. Almost an outline of the three categories of the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika is to be found here.\n\nIt may be supposed from these considerations that the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika has its origin in the general thought of those times, that is, the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika borrowed the materials from the thoughts of those days and systematized them at a somewhat later time.

If the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika had had its origin in orthodox Br\u0101hma\u1e47ism, such curious features could not have appeared and could not be explained. It is therefore more probable that the origin of the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika was in heterodox speculations, and in the course of time the system was on one side adjusted to orthodoxy, just as the later Vai\u015be\u1e63ika adapted itself to \u015aaivism and imported \u012a\u015bvara into the system.\n\nLater M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas are, in their philosophical theories, very similar to the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika, as in the case of Kum\u0101rila-bha\u1e6d\u1e6da and Prabh\u0101-kara, and M.S. contains terms identical with the technical terms of the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika. The similarities in the philosophical theories and in one aspect of the religious practices may suggest a conclusion the reverse of the above. But this is not the case. Though the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 originated earlier, as Thibaut and Jacobi assert, the earlier origin cannot in this case prove priority. Before the beginning of the Christian era there is, in the field of Br\u0101hma\u1e47ical orthodox speculations, no trace of an atomic theory. And the essential problem of the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 is ritual, while philosophical speculations are rare and quite subordinate. Under such circumstances a systematical theory of philosophy cannot be originated; on the contrary, it is more reasonable to suppose that the philosophical theories have been taken into the system from the outside and are used to make the sacrificial injunctions (dharma) or other essential factors of the system transcendent in\n\n1 Cf. V.S. 6, 2, 1-9. The Vai\u015be\u1e63ika is called the Ardha-vai\u015be\u1e63ika by \u015aa\u1e45kara in his Bh\u0101\u1e63ya on 2, 2, 18.\n2 See notes on ch. 1, 3, 22 (merit). Cf.

Some M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas did not acknowledge an atomic theory (\u015aloka-v\u1e5bttika on 1, 1, 5, sec. 5, \u015bl. 183).\nrelation to them. For instance, the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e41s\u0101 acknowledges the nine sorts of the means of knowledge (pram\u0101\u1e47a);\u00b9 but the means of knowledge have no such philosophical import in the system as in other systems; they only serve to prove that the sacrificial injunctions are far superior to them,\u00b2 and accordingly they are adopted in as large a number as possible. The philosophical speculations also serve the same purpose, never serve for the foundation of the system. Consequently the philosophical theories are so loose that eminent followers could explain them in their own ways, and this led to different opinions. Those theories in the system which are common to the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika are due to the receptiveness of the system when continually attacked by the latter.\u00b3 Thus this system cannot be considered as the source of the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika.\n\nAs for the Amar\u0101-Vikkhepa, the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika did not accept it as it was. As a realistic system, the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika is contrary to the idealistic tendency; nevertheless it was influenced by the Amar\u0101-Vikkhepa. A Jaina tradition says, \u201cindem alle diese 36 Unterabteilungen (9 substances, 17 attributes, 5 actions, 3 universalities, particularity and inherence) der sechs Grundprincipien sich unter vier Gesichtspunkte stellen, n\u00e4mlich 1. den der Position (Beisp. pu\u1e0dhav\u012b = prthiv\u012b); 2. den der Negation der Position (Beisp. apu\u1e0dhav\u012b); 3. den der Prohibition (Beisp. nopu\u1e0dhav\u012b); 4. den der Negation der Prohibition (Beisp. no apu\u1e0dhav\u012b), so ergeben sich\n\n\u00b9 In \u015aabara-sv\u0101min\u2019s Bh\u0101\u1e63ya on M.S. the six sorts are enumerated (pp. 6, 10). The Gau\u1e0da-p\u0101da-bh\u0101\u1e63ya on S.K. v. 4 asserts that sambhava, pratibh\u0101, and aitihya are acknowledged by Jaimini. Cf. S. T.-Kaumud\u012b on v. 5; N.S. 2, 2, 1\u201312; Pr. Bh., pp. 213\u201330.\n\n\u00b2 See the s\u016btras 1, 1, 4\u20135.\n\n\u00b3 That the system is comprehensive will be seen in Kum\u0101rila-bha\u1e6d\u1e6da\u2019s \u015aloka-v\u0101rttika. Not only the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika theories, but also the essential parts of Dig-n\u0101ga\u2019s logic are accepted and taken in by Kum\u0101rila as well as by Prabh\u0101-kara. Almost all the varieties of logical theory from Dig-n\u0101ga down to Kum\u0101rila are contained in the \u015aloka-v\u0101rttika on M.S. 1, 1, 5, autpattika-s\u016btra, sections 3 and 5.\nThis is perhaps a prior stage of enumeration (uddesha), definition (lak\u1e63a\u1e47a), and explanation (parik\u1e63\u0101); but the relation to the Amar\u0101-Vikkhepa cannot be denied, because the above four points of view are almost the same as the four modes of expression (atthi, n\u2019atthi, atthi ca n\u2019atthi ca, and n\u2019ev\u2019atthi na n\u2019atthi). Further, this strict method of investigation seems to have helped the development of the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika principle, distinguishing substance itself from attributes and actions, and of the theories concerning the relation between concepts and their objects, and of logic in the system.\n\nXI. Date of Systematization: the Categories\n\nGenerally a philosophical system may be described from the three points of view, epistemology, metaphysics, and ethics. In ancient times metaphysics is usually predominant, and epistemology appears at a later time and in advanced philosophical speculations. Consequently, though epistemology is really the foundation of metaphysics, the former is much neglected as compared with the latter in the ancient history of philosophy. The epistemological factor of the general thought of the time of Mah\u0101-v\u012bra and Buddha is not much developed in the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika; but the essential parts of the three points of view are well combined in the system. The facts are therefore in favour of the conclusion that the origin of the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika was in the time of Mah\u0101-v\u012bra and Buddha (the sixth\u2013fifth century B.C.).\n\n1 Leumann, *Indische Studien*, Bd. xviii, p. 121 f.\n2 Ny\u0101ya-kanda\u1e6d\u1e6di, pp. 26\u20137; Ny\u0101ya-bh\u0101sya, p. 9; Ny\u0101ya-v\u0101rttika, p. 29.\n3 See Brahma-j\u0101lu-sutta, pp. 37\u201340.\n4 See notes on ch. i, 3, 12 (cognition).\n5 Another evidence that the origin of the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika is as old as Jainism is found in the fact that the terms hetu and pram\u0101\u1e47a have the same meaning in both systems. See Vidy\u0101bh\u016b\u1e63ana, *History of the Medieval School of Indian Logic*, pp. 4\u20135; V.S. 9, 2, 4 (hetur apade\u015bo, l\u012bg\u0101\u1e43 pram\u0101\u1e47am kara\u1e47am ity-anarth\u0101ntaram).\nBut the systematization of the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika cannot be earlier than about 300 B.C. Kau\u1e6dilya (C\u0101\u1e47akya) in his Artha-s\u016btra states that philosophy is only the S\u0101\u1e45khya, the Yoga, and the Lok\u0101yata (C\u0101rv\u0101ka) (S\u0101\u1e45khyam Yogo Lok\u0101ya\u1e6dan ca ity-\u0101nvik\u1e63iki). Oldenberg remarks, \"dagegen ist dies kaum zweifelhaft, dass die Nichtnennung der beiden eng untereinander verbundenen Systeme, denen zu begegnen man hier noch erwarten k\u00f6nnte, des Ny\u0101ya und Vai\u015be\u1e63ika, in der Tat auf deren damaliger Nichtexistenz beruht. Den Auspruch \u0101nv\u012bk\u1e63ik\u012b (die auf Pr\u00fcfung beruhende (Wissenschaft)) zu sein erhob seiner Zeit der Ny\u0101ya ebenso entscheiden wie berechtigt.\" Consequently the systematization of the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika is later than 300 B.C., probably in the first century B.C., because the information concerning the sixth schism (18 A.D.) of Jainism reveals that the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika had already been systematized before the beginning of the Christian era. This does not, however, directly refer to the date of the compilation of V.S. V.S. seems to have been composed earlier than the other s\u016btras; but it presupposes not only the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 and the S\u0101\u1e45khya, but also the Ved\u0101nta and others. On the other hand, the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika doctrines in V.S. represent the earlier, perhaps the genuine, doctrines of the system\u2014at least the doctrines prevailing before the time of the sixth schism in Jainism, and the orthodox of the system.\n\nA distinct characteristic of the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika is a sharp and strict analysis of an object. The six categories are only the six modes of observation and of the explanation of an object. The distinction between substance and its\n\n---\n\n1 Die indische Philosophie (Kultur der Gegenwart, allg. Gesch. d. Phil.), pp. 32\u20134; Jacobi, Zur Fr\u00fchgeschichte der indischen Philosophie, pp. 736, 738, 743.\n2 Especially see 2, 1, 20 (relying on the commentaries); 3, 1, 1\u20132; 5, 2, 19\u201320; 7, 2, 3\u20138; 7, 2, 13; 9, 2, 3.\nattributes and actions\\(^1\\) is one of the fundamental principles. It leads to the theory of the *Asat-k\u0101rya-v\u0101da* and self (*\u0101tman*) distinguished from cognition (*budhhi*). But the relation between the fourth and the fifth category, universality (*s\u0101m\u0101nya*) and particularity (*vi\u015be\u1e63a*), is not in accordance with the above-noted characteristic, because an object is, on the one hand, classified under universality, and, on the other hand, under particularity, so that it cannot be fixed in a definite category. This is a natural consequence of the conceptual relations, as in the case of the classification of concepts in formal logic; but from the principle of the system it is not so strict as the other categories. Various opinions on this point arose even before the Christian era. Roha-gutta, the chief teacher in the sixth schism of Jainism (*Trair\u0101\u015bika-mata*, 544 A.V. = 18 A.D.)\\(^2\\) imported the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika doctrines into Jainism. Its first three categories and the last (sixth) are just the same as enumerated in *V.S.*; but the fourth, universality, and the fifth, particularity, are different from those of the *s\u016btra*.

The fifth might be a translation of mah\u0101-satt\u0101, but the term is not met with in any work. It is perhaps a translation of satt\u0101 modified by the analogy of the fourth. These Chinese equivalents may show that there were also different opinions concerning the fourth category, even in later times, and that the term mah\u0101-s\u0101m\u0101nya was still used. That the term s\u0101m\u0101nya-vi\u015be\u1e63a (\"universality-particularity\") occurs in the Chinese translations has already been pointed out in the preceding passage; it was not classed under the fourth category, but the fifth category itself was called s\u0101m\u0101nya-vi\u015be\u1e63a.\n\nThe three subdivisions of s\u0101m\u0101nya in the above quotation from the Jaina record are not known to V.S., Pr. Bh., the present treatise, or to any other works, and the three different opinions (I, II, III, in the above quotation) concerning the subdivisions came from different points of view.\n\nIn the first opinion (I), i.e. the opinion of Rohagutta, the mah\u0101-s\u0101m\u0101nya corresponds to abhidheyatva (\"capability of being designated\") and j\u00f1eyatva (\"knowableness\"), as common properties (s\u0101dharmya) of the six categories in Pr. Bh., and to \"knowable\" in our treatise. This view was probably suggested by V.S. 1, 1, 8. As it is applied only to the categories, the\n\n1 The first is used in the translations of the \u015aata-\u015b\u0101stra and the Satyasiddhi-\u015b\u0101stra (both by Kum\u0101ra-j\u012bva), and of the Up\u0101ya-Kaus\u0101l\u0101ya-hrdaya-\u015b\u0101stra (by Kekaya), the second and the fourth in the translation of our treatise (by Yuan Chwang), and the second to the fifth in Kwh\u0113i-c\u012b's commentaries on Nos. 1197 and 1216.\n\n2 See notes on ch. i, 10 (commonness).\n\n3 Pr.

The other three categories relate to the same object, in which the first three categories reside.\nmah\u0101-s\u0101m\u0101nya does not relate to the contents of the categories; but the s\u0101m\u0101nya, lower than the mah\u0101-s\u0101m\u0101nya, includes the contents of the categories and relates to the vi\u015be\u1e63a, so that the lower s\u0101m\u0101nya is called s\u0101m\u0101nya-vi\u015be\u1e63a. The satt\u0101-s\u0101m\u0101nya corresponds exactly to satt\u0101 or bh\u0101va in V.S.\u00b9 The division of mah\u0101-s\u0101m\u0101nya and s\u0101m\u0101nya-vi\u015be\u1e63a springs from the same point of view (pad\u0101rtha\u1e6dv\u0101, \u201ccategory-ness,\u201d and dravyatva, \u201csubstance-ness,\u201d etc., as the objective entities corresponding to the subjective concepts of category and substance, etc.), while the satt\u0101-s\u0101m\u0101nya comes from the notion with regard to the bh\u016b-pad\u0101rtha\u00b9 that that is existent. Both satt\u0101-s\u0101m\u0101nya and s\u0101m\u0101nya-vi\u015be\u1e63a have the same scope, and s\u0101m\u0101nya-vi\u015be\u1e63a naturally implies existence. Even mah\u0101-s\u0101m\u0101nya must imply existence. Pr. Bh. ascribes existence (astitva) to the six categories as a common quality (s\u0101dharmya). Accordingly, pad\u0101rtha\u1e6dv\u0101 in pad\u0101rtha\u1e6dv\u0101-buddhi-k\u0101ri implies existence (sad, in bh\u016b-pad\u0101rtha-sad-buddhi-k\u0101ri). Satt\u0101-s\u0101m\u0101nya, therefore, turns out to be superfluous, and the three subdivisions are reduced to two. If bh\u016b-pad\u0101rtha should mean the six categories, the mah\u0101-s\u0101m\u0101nya and the satt\u0101-s\u0101m\u0101nya would, after all, become one. The third opinion (III, param aparam ca) probably accepted such a consequence. This third opinion was adopted by Pr. Bh., which maintains that the para-s\u0101m\u0101nya (\u201cthe highest universality\u201d) is satt\u0101, while the apara-s\u0101m\u0101nya (\u201cthe lower universality\u201d) includes s\u0101m\u0101nya-vi\u015be\u1e63a-s\u0101m\u0101nya in the first opinion, and ananta-viseso (anantya-vi\u015be\u1e63a), the second sort of viseso (vi\u015be\u1e63a). Consequently, the vi\u015be\u1e63a (\u201cparticularity\u201d) contains anta-viseso (antya-vi\u015be\u1e63a, \u201cthe final species or the ultimate particulars\u201d) alone. The second opinion (II) is too artificial.\n\nThe fifth category, vi\u015be\u1e63a, is not usually subdivided.\n\n\u00b9 Bh\u016b-pad\u0101rtha includes the first three categories. See Pr. Bh., pp. 17, 19.\nEven Pr. Bh. does not know the two sorts of vi\u015be\u1e63a, but a similar subdivision is met with in Kwh\u0113i-ci\u2019s commentary.\\(^1\\)\n\nThese different opinions show that the intention was to classify things either under universality or under particularity, and to fix them in the definite classes. At the same time they prove that the systematization of the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika theories contained in V.S. took place in a time distant from 18 A.D. Besides, that the Jainas themselves maintain that the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika system was established by Roha-gutta is a good reason for holding that the systematization was not very near to the sixth schism, because, had the systematization been very recent, they could not have claimed to be the founders.\\(^2\\) On the other hand, it may be supposed that the systematization did not take place at a time very remote from the schism: otherwise the Jainas could not have connected Roha-gutta with its origination, because the founder would have been conceived as a legendary personage. The probabilities are in favour of even the middle of the first century B.C. as the date of the systematization.\n\n**XII: THE SUTRA; EVIDENCE FOR DATING: 1. THE VIBHASA, ETC.**\n\nWe have now established the date of the supposed origin and systematization of the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika, and learned a little in outline of the doctrinal development. We shall next proceed to obtain some materials concerning the date of V.S. and the development of the doctrines from Chinese translations.\n\n1. To begin with, we shall first refer to the *Abhidharma-mah\u0101-vibh\u0101\u1e63\u0101-\u015b\u0101stra*,\\(^3\\) which was composed by Vasu-mitra\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) See notes on ch. i, 10 (commonness).\n\n\\(^2\\) SBE., vol. xlv, pp. xxxvii-viii.\n\n\\(^3\\) See supra. Vol. cxiii, p. 53b.\nand others under the patronage of Kani\u1e63ka (the first century A.D.).\u00b9 The work consists of 200 volumes, and is not easy to read. Only one passage has been found. \"The Vai\u015be\u1e63ika maintains that there are five sorts of actions, namely, throwing upwards, throwing downwards, contracting, expanding, and going as a fifth.\"\n\nThe Vibh\u0101\u1e63\u0101-s\u0101stra,\u00b2 which seems to be a short extract from the above work,\u00b3 also refers to the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika. \"A certain teacher maintains that there are five sense-organs, the organ of smell, of taste, of seeing, of touch, and of hearing. This opinion is the same as held by the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika.\"\u2074 Next mentioned is the S\u0101\u1e45khya, which holds that there are the five intellectual organs (buddhi-indriya), the five organs of action (karma-indriya), and a mind (manas).\n\nThe references are too slight to supply detailed ideas of the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika; but there is ground for concluding that the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika had been acknowledged by the Buddhists in these days as a system having the special doctrines.\n\nAccording to Jacobi the oldest reference to the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika is found in the Caraka-sa\u1e43hit\u0101.\u2075 Caraka seems to have lived in the time of Kani\u1e63ka.\u2076 Subsequently the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika is known to have been referred to by various writers.\n\n\u00b9 The date of Kani\u1e63ka has lately been discussed by English eminent scholars in JRAS., 1912, pp. 665, 981; 1913, pp. 55, 627, 911 f.

Kau\u015bika said to his friend, ' . . . Why do you look down upon the teachings of our Buddha so much? The Vai\u015be\u1e63ika-\u015b\u0101stra is so defective that it is by no means to be compared with the teachings of Buddha. The \u015b\u0101stra cannot properly explain what an object is, and misunderstands causality . . .' The friend asked him, 'For what reason can you assert that the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika-\u015b\u0101stra does not properly explain causality?' The \u015b\u0101stra explains that broken potsherds are the cause of a pot. How can it be said that the \u015b\u0101stra cannot properly explain causality?' Kau\u015bika answered, 'If the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika-\u015b\u0101stra really assert it, the assertion is nonsense. Threads having become warp and woof are, as everyone knows, the cause of a cloth. Just so in the case of a pot and a jar. When a pot has existed, there can be potsherds; but it is never the case that there are potsherds without a pot having existed. Before a pot has been broken into potsherds, the pot is of use. Broken potsherds are, therefore, by no means the cause of a pot. A potter makes, it is certain, a pot from clay, but never from potsherds . . . Before Buddha, who has da\u015babala\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) No. 1182, translated by Kum\u0101ra-j\u012bva in 405 A.D. The work has been translated into French by \u00c9douard Huber (\u0100\u015bvagho\u1e63a, S\u016btr\u0101l\u0101\u1e45k\u0101ra, Paris, 1908).\n\n\\(^2\\) \u015a\u0101stra in such cases does not denote a special work, but simply means \"doctrine\". In another passage Kum\u0101ra-j\u012bva used the \u015a\u0101\u1e45khya-s\u016btra and the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika-s\u016btra. S\u016btra also means \"doctrine\".\n\nJ\u00f1\u0101ti-putra is Zho-thi-swei-mo (or Jo-t'i-sonei-mo) in Chinese. Zho-thi (Jo-t'i) is evidently the transliteration of N\u0101-ti (= J\u00f1\u0101ti), while Swei-mo (sonei-mo) is doubtful. In Buddhist works the \u015a\u0101\u1e45khya, the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika, the Nirgranthas, and the J\u00f1\u0101ti-putras are connected with one another in respect to their opinions; accordingly I have ventured to replace Zho-thi-swei-mo by J\u00f1\u0101ti-putra. In such cases the J\u00f1\u0101ti-putras are called Ajivakas, while the Nirgranthas are called naked medicants (Dig-ambara).

But after our Buddha, the sun, appeared and shone, wisdom (of creatures) became clear, so that the *Vai\u015be\u1e63ika-\u015b\u0101stra* was known not to contain any reasonable explanation and to be good for nothing, like an owl that is flying and energetic at night and conceals itself and is not energetic in the daytime . . . .\n\n\"Broken potsherds are the cause of a pot\" is not met with in *V.S.*, but \"threads are the cause of a cloth\" is a hackneyed metaphor in the *Vai\u015be\u1e63ika*. Potsherds as broken pieces cannot, as it stands, be the cause of other pots; but this example probably means that potsherds are in essence the same as clay, and the difference between them comes from the difference of the state, that is, clay is called so before it has become a pot, and potsherds exist after a pot has been broken. Perhaps an imperfect illustration of the *Asat-k\u0101rya-v\u0101da*. The example of an owl possibly came from the meaning of Ul\u016bka and does not appear to be an accidental coincidence. Ci-ts\u0101n and Kwh\u0113i-ci may have followed A\u015bva-gho\u1e63a in the explanation. A\u015bva-gho\u1e63a placed the origin of the *Vai\u015be\u1e63ika* in a time before Buddha; but, as stated above, there was before Buddha as yet no theory similar to the *Vai\u015be\u1e63ika*. We therefore understand that Ka\u1e47\u0101da was, even at the time of A\u015bva-gho\u1e63a, known to have been an ancient \u1e5a\u1e63i, and that the followers of the *Vai\u015be\u1e63ika* had traced their doctrine back to this ancient \u1e5a\u1e63i, who was, nevertheless, not the real founder, if he indeed lived in a time prior to Buddha.\n\n---\n\n1 *Mah\u0101-r\u016bpapatti*, vii.\n2 Vol. i, pp. 72a, 73b.\n3 *Upask\u0101ra*, on 2, 1, 22; 5, 2, 24; 10, 2, 3; 10, 2, 5.\n4 This may be compared with *Ny\u0101ya-bh\u0101\u1e63ya*, on 4, 1, 16, and *Ny\u0101yav\u0101rttika*, p. 458.

Before proceeding further we have to study the dates of N\u0101g\u0101rjuna, Deva (\u0100rya-deva), Hari-varman, and others.\n\nSa\u1e45-c\u0101o (S\u014d-j\u014d), a famous disciple of Kum\u0101ra-j\u012bva,\\(^1\\) states that Deva lived 800\u2013900 A.N.\\(^2\\) According to Yuan Chwang's *Si-y\u00fc-ci* Deva seems to have seen N\u0101g\u0101rjuna when N\u0101g\u0101rjuna was passing his days on the \u015ar\u012b-parvata near the River Kistna. N\u0101g\u0101rjuna lived about 750\u2013850 A.N.\n\nSa\u1e45-jwei (S\u014d-yei), another disciple of Kum\u0101ra-j\u012bva, says that A\u015bva-gho\u1e63a came to the world after the time of the Ca\u1e47-f\u0101 (sh\u014d-b\u014d), and N\u0101g\u0101rjuna came at the end of the time of the Hsiang-f\u0101 (z\u014d-b\u014d).\\(^3\\) He quotes an Indian tradition which says, \"if A\u015bva-gho\u1e63a and N\u0101g\u0101rjuna had not come into the world at times following respectively that of the Ca\u1e47-f\u0101 and that of the Hsiang-f\u0101, the teachings of our Buddha would have seriously declined and would have ceased to exist.\"\\(^4\\) Now the time of the Ca\u1e47-f\u0101 is the duration of 500 years A.N., and that of the Hsiang-f\u0101 is another 500 years after the Ca\u1e47-f\u0101 according to N\u0101g\u0101rjuna and Hwui-jwei\\(^4\\) (E-yei), another disciple of Kum\u0101ra-j\u012bva. Consequently A\u015bva-gho\u1e63a may be placed in 650 A.N. and N\u0101g\u0101rjuna in 800 A.N.\n\nHari-varman is said to have lived in the 900th year A.N.,\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Kum\u0101ra-j\u012bva is the first translator of works of the three great Buddhists.\n\n\\(^2\\) In his preface to the translation of the \u015a\u0101ta-s\u0101stra (*Chu-s\u00e4n-ts\u00e4n-ci-tsi*, p. 62a); \"800\u2013900 A.N.\" is literally \"800 and some years\".\n\n\\(^3\\) In his preface to the translation of the Praj\u00f1\u0101-p\u0101ramit\u0101-s\u0101stra (No. 1169) of N\u0101g\u0101rjuna, translated by Kum\u0101ra-j\u012bva (*Chu-s\u00e4n-ts\u00e4n-ci-tei*, p. 60a\u2013b).\n\n\\(^4\\) *Chu-s\u00e4n-ts\u00e4n-ci-tsi*, p. 30b; *Mah\u0101-praj\u00f1\u0101-p\u0101ramit\u0101-s\u0101stra*, vol. ii, p. 16a; vol. lxvii, p. 36b. Some Buddhists explain that the Ca\u1e47-f\u0101 is the duration of 1000 years A.N.; but this opinion does not matter in the present case, because the authorities of the above discussion are the disciples of Kum\u0101ra-j\u012bva and N\u0101g\u0101rjuna himself. Ca\u1e47-f\u0101 literally means \"the true law (sad-dharma)\"; the true law of Buddha remains for 500 years A.N. as it was, while during the time of the Hsiang-f\u0101 the true law declines.\ni.e. 800\u2013900, according to Yuan-Ch\u2019ang,\u00b9 and in 890 A.D. according to San-jwei.\u00b2 Hari-varman was a disciple of Kum\u0101ra-labdh\u0101 of the Sarv\u0101sti-v\u0101da.\u00b3\n\nThe date of the Nirv\u0101\u1e47a held by Kum\u0101ra-j\u012bva and his disciples is 637 B.C.\u2074 Hence we conclude the following dates: \u0100\u015bva-gho\u1e63a lived about 13 A.D., N\u0101g\u0101rjuna about 113\u2013213 A.D., Deva about 163\u2013263 A.D., and Hari-varman about 260 or 270 A.D.\n\nThere are more than fifty different traditions of the date of the Nirv\u0101\u1e47a in Chinese Buddhist works. The date 637 B.C. is one of them. The present writer does not mean that 637 B.C. is the only possible date of the Nirv\u0101\u1e47a; but he holds that the dates stated above must be calculated from the date of the Nirv\u0101\u1e47a held by Kum\u0101ra-j\u012bva and his disciples.\n\nYuan Chwang remarks, \u201cin his (Kum\u0101ra-labdh\u0101\u2019s) time \u0100\u015bva-gho\u1e63a in the east, Deva in the south, N\u0101g\u0101rjuna in the west, and Kum\u0101ra-labdh\u0101 in the north were called the Four Shining Suns.\u201d\u2075 \u0100\u015bva-gho\u1e63a was, according to the traditions, a disciple of P\u0101r\u015bva\u2076 and a copyist or a writer in the fourth Buddhist Council under Kani\u1e63ka.\u2077 According to another tradition the successive order of Buddhist Patriarch is \u201cP\u0101r\u015bva\u2014Pu\u1e47ya-y\u0101sas\u2014\u0100\u015bva-gho\u1e63a\u2014Kapi-mala\u2014N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2014Deva\u201d.\u2078 N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\n\n\u00b9 In his Life of Hari-varman, see before.\n\u00b2 In his preface to the Satya-siddhi-s\u0101stra (No. 1274, translated by Kum\u0101ra-j\u012bva) of Hari-varman.\n\u00b3 A verse by Kum\u0101ra-labdh\u0101 is quoted by Vasu-bandhu in his Abhidharma-kos\u0101-s\u0101stra.

He also states in the same work, \u201cKacc\u0101yana (= Katy\u0101yani-putra) composed the (*Abhidharma-j\u00f1\u0101na-prasth\u0101na-s\u016btra* in eight *granthas* (A\u1e63\u1e6da-grantha))\u00b2... afterwards followers of his composed the *Vibh\u0101\u1e63\u0101* (or *Vaibh\u0101\u1e63\u0101*), because Buddhists in later times (later than the author) could not (or will not) thoroughly understand the eight *granthas*.\u201d\u00b3 This\n\n\u00b9 Vol. xcix, p. 99a.\n\u00b2 This is No. 1273 = No. 1275. *S\u016btra* is sometimes confused with *\u015b\u0101stra* by Kum\u0101ra-j\u012bva.\n\u00b3 Vol. ii, p. 18a; cf. vol. iv, p. 34b; vol. xxxviii, p. 102a.\n\nThe date of A\u015bva-gho\u1e63a is one of the most difficult questions among Chinese and Japanese Buddhists, because the *Mah\u0101-y\u0101na-\u015braddhotp\u0101da-\u015b\u0101stra* (No. 1250 = No. 1249), one of the fundamental and the most systematic works of the Mah\u0101-y\u0101na Buddhism, is ascribed to him, and the question of his date is, accordingly, connected with the origin of the Mah\u0101-y\u0101na, while his *Life* does not suggest that he was a Mah\u0101y\u0101nist and the author of the work. Besides, the fact that the doctrines contained in the work are contrary in some points to the doctrines of the F\u0101-hsiang-tsung (both have similar doctrines) adds to the difficulty of the question. Though it is clear from No. 1340 that he knew the *Praj\u00f1\u0101-p\u0101ramit\u0101*-doctrine, the question is still undecided. Some writers believe that there were two persons named A\u015bva-gho\u1e63a, relying upon a tradition held among the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101dins (mentioned by Sa\u1e45-yiu in his *Chu-san-tsan-chi-tsi*, p. 72a-b). But this is only a mention of the name without any account of him, and is only by hearsay. Nevertheless, the present writer contents himself, at the present time, with the above date, relying upon the oldest and native tradition, and regards the question of A.\u2019s date as different from that of the author of the work, which is not always ascribed to him by old traditions, and from that of the origin of the Mah\u0101-y\u0101na.\n\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s date has also many different traditions. Generally the date is believed to be 700 A.D. Its source is in the *Mah\u0101-m\u0101y\u0101-s\u016btra* (No. 382, translated in 479\u2013502 A.D.), where the Buddha prophesies that N\u0101g\u0101rjuna will be born 700 A.D. But the date of the Nirv\u0101\u1e47a held by the author of the S\u016btra is not known, and the S\u016btra is not reliable; it consists of a collection, so to speak, of materials from the *Mah\u0101-parinibb\u0101na-sutta* and other s\u016btras, or from unknown sources. N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s date is, at the earliest, undoubtedly later than 500 years A.D., because in his *Praj\u00f1\u0101-p\u0101ramit\u0101-\u015b\u0101stra*, vol. ii, p. 16a; vol. xxx, p. 52b; vol. xxxv, p. 84a; vol. lxiii, p. 14a; vol. lxvii, p. 36b, he states that Buddhist schools were originated after 500 years A.D.\npassage clearly shows that N\u0101g\u0101rjuna knew about the compilation of the Abhidharma-mah\u0101-vibh\u0101s\u0101-s\u016btra in the fourth Council. Consequently, A\u015bva-ghosa, as a disciple of P\u0101r\u015bva, seems to be a little earlier than N\u0101g\u0101rjuna, just as Hari-varman, a disciple of Kum\u0101ra-labdha, is a little later than N\u0101g\u0101rjuna. Kum\u0101ra-j\u012bva's tradition is one of the oldest.\n\nHari-varman's Satya-siddhi-s\u016btra has no commentary; but N\u0101g\u0101rjuna's M\u0101dhyamika-s\u016btra\u00b9 and Deva's \u015aata-s\u016btra have commentaries by Indian authors. The commentary on the former is by Pi\u1e45gala,\u00b2 and that on the latter is by the Bodhi-sattva Vasu. Some scholars believe that Pi\u1e45gala (or Pi\u1e45gala-netra or N\u012bla-netra) is another name of Deva.\u00b3 But Kum\u0101ra-j\u012bva and his disciples never suggest that the commentator was D\u0113va. Nor do they assert that the Bodhi-sattva Vasu is the same person as the famous Bodhi-sattva Vasu-bandhu; but Ci-ts\u0101n, the commentator on the translation of the work, asserts that Vasu is Vasu-bandhu,\u2074 and Peri\u2075 is of the same opinion. Be that as it may, the M\u0101dhyamika-s\u016btra and the \u015aata-s\u016btra were translated in 409 and 404 A.D. Kum\u0101ra-j\u012bva (c. 340\u2013413 A.D.), according to his Life, had been instructed in these works about 353 A.D. by Surya-soma in Sh\u0101-ch\u016b\n\n\u00b9 No. 1179. The work has been translated by Walleser from Chinese into German (Heidelberg, 1912).\n\u00b2 p. 23a,\u2014Sa\u00f1-jwei says in his preface to the work that there were many commentaries on it in India; the commentary was by a Brahma-c\u0101rin, or a Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, Pi\u1e45gala, the Blue-eyed in Chinese, who devoted himself to the doctrine; but his commentary was not perfect, so that the translator, Kum\u0101ra-j\u012bva, filled up and omitted some passages.\n\u00b3 Nanjio's, App. i, 4. Walleser identifies Pi\u1e45gala-ak\u1e63a with Vimal\u0101k\u1e63a (Intro., pp. x\u2013xiii). N\u0101g\u0101rjuna is said to have quoted a verse of Deva in his Akutobhaya, a commentary on the M\u0101dhyamika-s\u016btra (Welleser, Die mittlere Lehre, Heidelberg, 1911, p. 175). In the Chinese translation (p. 57a) the verse also occurs as a verse of the Catuh-s\u0101ta-parik\u1e63\u0101 (cf. T\u0101ra-n\u0101tha's Geschichte, p. 83); but in Bh\u0101va-viveka's Praj\u00f1\u0101-d\u012bpa-s\u016btra (No. 1185), another commentary, the verse is omitted (p. 138b).\n\u2074 In his sub-commentary Dainihon-zokuz\u014dky\u014d, 73, bk. 5, p. 372a.\n\u2075 V.

Here, having stated the theory which says that time (k\u0101la) is the cause of everything in the world, and having quoted two verses,\\(^3\\) he says: \u201cAnother maintains that all things in the world, e.g. heaven and earth, agreeable and disagreeable things, are not considered as products of time. But time is unchangeable and has the real existence relating to a cause (\\(V.S.\\) 2, 2, 7\u20139; 5, 2, 26; 7, 1, 25). The substance time, being subtle, cannot be seen, nor known (by the sense-organs). It is, however, inferred from the effects like (the opening of) flowers and (the ripening of) fruits. That is to say, by the marks\u2014the past year and the present year, posteriority and priority, slowness and quickness\u2014time is known as existent, however invisible (2, 2, 6).

Although the four divisions (= Catur\u0101rya-\u0101rya-saty\u0101\u1e47i) in your system do not contain it, our six categories contain it; space is not enumerated among the five skandhas, the twelve \u0101yatanas, and the eighteen dh\u0101tus\\(^1\\) of your system; but it is enumerated under our category substance' (V.S. 2, 2, 11). The substance space has the characteristics of eternity and of real existence, that is, space is eternal and really existent (2, 2, 11\u20132). The s\u016btra says, 'Where the sun rises is the east, where it sets is the west, where the sun moves is the south, and whither it does not go is the north. The conjunction of the sun (with space) takes place in the three divisions of its course, prior (or past), present and posterior (or future). The divisions of the course presuppose space. Where the conjunction (of the sun in its course) first takes place is the east. In like manner the south and the west are explained (2, 2, 13\u20135). Whither the sun does not go there is no division of the course.' '(That is) far, (this is) near, that (is there), and this (is here),' are the marks of space. Without space there are no (such notions as) that and this. 'That' and 'this' are the marks of space; they are not space itself (2, 2, 10).\\(^2\\)\n\nConcerning self (\u0101tman) N\u0101g\u0101rjuna naturally denies its existence: \"There is no self asserted, because the mark of its existence cannot be found out. Of everything existence is inferred when marks are known; e.g. the existence of fire is known from seeing smoke and feeling hot... Someone will object 'that there is breathing out and in (pr\u0101\u1e47a and ap\u0101\u1e47a) in a body is a mark of the existence of self.'

Such atoms are caused to aggregate with one another by the force of merit and demerit (dharma and adharma, i.e. ad\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da in V.S. 6, 2, 13) and form bodies (cf. 5, 2, 17\u20138).

The sixty-two sorts of d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6di are always used in Buddhist works. Cf.

Even in V.S. the theory is not so fully discussed as is the Sat-k\u0101rya-v\u0101da in S.K. (v. 9).\n\nAs regards ether (\u0101k\u0101\u015ba), N\u0101g\u0101rjuna's M\u0101dhyamika-s\u016btra\u00b3 denies its reality. But in the text ether is one of the six elements\u2074 (dh\u0101tu), which are not known to the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika. Pi\u1e45gala explains that ether is the universal vacuum, where the four elements are contained. This concept of ether is the same as in V.S.\u2075 In another passage N\u0101g\u0101rjuna states: \"Some, both heretics and Buddhists, acknowledge eternal things. Some of the eternal things are common to both, but others are not common. The former are ether and Nirv\u0101\u1e47a, etc., while the latter are self, time, space, atoms, and prak\u1e5bti.\"\u2076 It will be seen that this passage refers to the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika and the S\u0101\u1e43khya.\n\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna did not refute the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika theory of attributes so thoroughly as in the case of substances. Only one passage has been found in the Mah\u0101-praj\u00f1\u0101-p\u0101ramit\u0101-s\u016btra, where he refutes the reality of number\n\n\u00b9 Cf. vol. xii, p. 79a; vol. xxxvi, p. 89b; vol. lxxxix, p. 53a-b. These passages sometimes refer to the atomic theory of the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da-v\u0101da, and not always to the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika.\n\u00b2 e.g. M\u0101dhyamika-s\u016btra, pp. 27b, 45a f.; Dv\u0101da\u015ba-dv\u0101ra-s\u016btra (No. 1186), p. 68a and others.\n\u00b3 pp. 28a-b.\n\u2074 Prthivi, ap, tejas, v\u0101yu, \u0101k\u0101\u015ba, and vij\u00f1\u0101na. The six elements are an important factor in the Shin-gon-sh\u016b (the Mantra sect).\n\u2075 See notes on ch. i, 2, 5-7, and Jacobi's mention of the atomic theory of the Jainas quoted above.\n\u2076 Mah\u0101-praj\u00f1\u0101-p\u0101ramit\u0101-s\u016btra, vol. xv, p. 98a = Pi\u1e45gala's commentary, p. 27a, and Vasu's commentary, p. 46b.\nand individuality (s\u0101\u1e45khya and prthaktva). If the passage is compared with the parallel passage in Deva\u2019s work and Vasu\u2019s commentary, the refutation is seen to have been directed against the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika.\n\nThe above quotations might possibly seem to favour the supposition that V.S. had been composed before the time of N\u0101g\u0101rjuna, that is to say, was composed about 50\u2013150 A.D., though some of his references (e.g. to space) are not correctly stated. But, in fact, this incorrectness or the deviation from the original is, in this case, of such a kind as to show that the author had once had the original s\u016btra in his hands or known about it. That the quotations are not sufficient in number is perhaps no objection, because they contain the proofs of self, space, time, atoms, etc., which are peculiar to V.S. We shall next consult the works of Deva and Hari-varman with a view to supporting the supposition.\n\n5. Deva, relying upon the last quoted statement of N\u0101g\u0101rjuna, refutes the reality of ether, time, space, and atoms, and quotes the assertions of the other system. \u201cThe other says, \u2018there really exists a substance ether, which is eternal, all-pervading, and does not consist of parts (V.S. 2, 1, 28\u201331), because everyone believes its existence in every place and in every time\u2019 (s\u016btra).\u201d And, \u201cthe other says, \u2018ether must exist; it is all-pervading and eternal, because actions (karma) are\n\n---\n\n1 Vol. i, p. 14a.\n2 \u015a\u0101ta-s\u016btra, c. 3, 4. In the Up\u0101ya-ka\u1e47\u1e0dalya-h\u1e5bdaya-s\u016btra (No. 1257, translated in 472 A.D.), it is stated that the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika is the system of the six categories, substance, etc. (pp. 8b\u20139a), and the six categories are regarded as a kind of principle or method of reasoning. The work refers to Buddhism, Fire-worshippers, Grammarians or M\u012bm\u0101\u1e41sakas, the school of medicine, Vai\u015be\u1e63ikas, S\u0101\u1e45khya, Yogas, Nirgranthas, teachers who maintain that everything is one in essence, and teachers who maintain that everything is different from one another.

Further ('atoms must be non-eternal') because they are distinguished by colour, etc. (s\u016btra; 7, 1, 18\u20139).'\\(^2\\)\n\nThe last quotations suggest to us that ether, time, and space are all-pervading and eternal as well, differing from atoms, which agree with the three substances in the quality of eternity, but do not agree with them in being all-pervading. Atoms are imperceptible, but they are spherical and have no normal extension; this is a characteristic of the atomic theory of the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika. And atoms are inferred from their effects, but they are not proved by the method of analysis (anavasth\u0101); this is also a characteristic of V.S. The aggregate of two atoms corresponds to the \"binary atomic compound (dvyanuka)\" in later Vai\u015be\u1e63ika theories, but there is no suggestion of the theory of the \"ternary atomic compound (tiryanuka)\".\\(^3\\)\n\nAll the above quotations from the \u015a\u0101ta-\u015b\u0101stra, depending on the statement of N\u0101g\u0101rjuna, appear to be a complement\n\n\\(^1\\) Vasu explains that if two atoms conjoin with each other on all the sides, the effects must be spherical, but the effects of two atoms are not spherical as seen. If atoms can conjoin with each other, there cannot be two atoms conjunct. If two atoms are accumulated, the effects have height. Consequently, atoms must have extension. If so, they are not eternal. A similar refutation is found in \u015aa\u1e45kara's Bh\u0101sya on B.S. 2, 2, 11 f. According to Vasu the effect of two atoms is perceptible, while one atom is imperceptible.

This chapter is called Refutation of Eternal Things, which are ether, space, time, atoms, and Nirv\u0101\u1e47a (of other systems than the Buddhist).

The second means that, as, when a house is on fire, the owner suffers from loss, in like manner self suffers when the body is killed, but self itself cannot be killed like the owner. These opinions may be compared with N.S. 3, 1, 4.\n\n\\(^3\\) Ch. ii, pp. 40b\u201341b. A very similar statement is found in Pi\u1e45gala\u2019s commentary, pp. 56b\u201357a.

It is curious enough to notice that Deva himself used the Ny\u0101ya theories instead of the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika in regard to so important a doctrine as the existence of self, while Vasu, commenting on the same work, used the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika theories, which were also handled by N\u0101g\u0101rjuna. It is therefore clear that Deva considered the Ny\u0101ya theories as being also Vai\u015be\u1e63ika. In other passages also Deva confused the Ny\u0101ya theories with the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika, e.g., the theory that the eyes have a kind of light which goes out to objects, when we perceive them, and makes them perceptible,\u00b9 and the theory of the relation between a whole and its parts.\u00b2 Consequently, the Ny\u0101ya system was not regarded as distinct from the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika, if indeed the former had been systematized or N.S. had been composed.\u00b3\n\n\u00b9 N.S. 3, 1, 32-4; \u015aata-s\u0101stra, p. 44a; \u015aata-s\u0101stra-vaipulya, p. 50b.\n\u00b2 N.S. 2, 1, 31-4; 4, 2, 4-17; \u015aata-s\u0101stra, p. 42a.\n\u00b3 Nos. 1254, 1259, and 1260 (all were translated in 508-35 A.D.) are ascribed to Deva, but it is doubtful whether they are really Deva\u2019s works. No. 1259 refutes the four systems, which maintain that self and cognition are one and the same thing (the S\u0101\u1e41khya), that they are something different from each other (the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika), that they are either the same or different (the Nirgrantha), and that they are neither the same nor different (the J\u00f1\u0101tiputra). This classification of the four systems is followed by S\u0101ra-mati\u2019s Mah\u0101-y\u0101na-prave\u015ba-s\u0101stra (No. 1243, p. 65a), by Dharma-p\u0101la\u2019s Vaipulya-sata-s\u0101stra-vy\u0101khy\u0101 (a commentary on No. 1189, p. 116a, a little different), and Vij\u00f1apti-m\u0101trat\u0101-siddhi-s\u0101stra, p. 3b. The first and the second of the four systems are also set forth in the \u015aata-s\u0101stra, chs. 3, 4. No. 1254 has the first two of the four systems in a part of the commentary by an unknown writer. Deva\u2019s text consists of one hundred syllables (the work is called the \u015aat\u0101k\u1e63ara-s\u0101stra), and contains a description of the first two of the four systems. No. 1260 states the twenty different opinions concerning Nirv\u0101\u1e47a. The seventh is the opinion of the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika. It runs, \u201cThe Vai\u015be\u1e63ika maintains that atoms and so on (here the text is corrupted) are eternal and produce all things in the world, intelligent and unintelligent, by combination. The first process of combination is the combination of two atoms and so on. Without atoms and so on there is no combination of them. If there is no combination, they exist dispersed. The dispersed existence of atoms and so on is Nirv\u0101\u1e47a. Consequently the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika says that (the knowledge of) atoms and their qualities leads to Nirv\u0101\u1e47a.\u201d\nDeva also refutes the *Asat-k\u0101rya-v\u0101da*, attributes, universality, and particularity, but the refutation is not of great importance. Universality and particularity in Deva's work will be referred to later on.\n\n6. Hari-varman, in his *Satya-siddhi-s\u0101stra*, says: \"An opponent urges, 'Some teachers maintain that everything exists, while others contend that everything does not exist. What are really existing and what are not existing?' The author answers, 'Those things which really exist are contained in the twelve \u0101yatanas named by the Buddha. The substances, such as earth, etc.; the attributes, such as number, etc.; the actions, such as throwing upwards and throwing downwards, etc.; universality, particularity, and inherence\u2014these objects and *prak\u1e5bti* are, like the horn of a hare, the hair of a tortoise, the feet of a snake, the smell of salt, and the colour of wind, called non-existent. In a certain s\u016btra the Buddha said, \"There is no trace left (by birds) in sky, no \u015arama\u1e47a among T\u012brthakas, and people like to discuss in vain whether the Tath\u0101gata exists or not (after death).\" (These are examples of things non-existent.) But, according as people adhere to different systems, they differently acknowledge things as existent or real. The six categories, such as substance, etc., are real in Ul\u016bka's system; the twenty-five principles are real in the S\u0101mkhya; and the sixteen topics (*artha*) are real in the Ny\u0101ya...\"\n\n---\n\n1 *\u015aata-s\u0101stra*, p. 45b f.; *\u015aata-s\u0101stra-vaipulya*, p. 51b.\n2 pp. 41b-43a; p. 51a.\n3 Ch. xxiii, p. 17a. Ny\u0101ya is originally *na-ya-hsiu-mo* in Chinese. *Na-ya* is the transliteration of *N\u0101-ya* (= Ny\u0101ya). *Hsiu-mo* is the same as *Swei-mo* in *Zho-thi-swei-mo*. Praj\u00f1\u0101-ruci in his translation of the *Madhy\u0101ntinugama-s\u0101stra* (No. 1246, translated in 543 A.D.) uses the transliteration *Zho-ya-su-mo*. *Zho-ya* is the transliteration of *N\u0101-ya* (= Ny\u0101ya). *Su-mo* is the same as *Hsiu-mo* and *Swei-mo*. Both *N\u0101ya* and *Ny\u0101ya* are the same as Ny\u0101ya (Jacobi, *Ausgew\u00e4hlte Erz\u00e4hlungen in M\u0101h\u0101r\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dri*, p. 119; Andersen, *P\u0101li Reader*, p. 105); but *N\u0101ya* is also identified with *J\u00f1\u0101ta* in *J\u00f1\u0101taputra* (*J\u00f1\u0101tiputra*, Weber, *Ind. Stud.*, xvi,\nWe have here, for the first time, a mention of the six categories.\\(^1\\) Though N\u0101g\u0101rjuna and Deva knew the six categories, they did not name them side by side. Importance attaches to the reference to the sixteen topics of the Ny\u0101ya. The sixteen topics are not explained in the work, nor does the name Ny\u0101ya occur again throughout the work. But it is evident that the Ny\u0101ya had been systematized before Hari-varman. Hari-varman also confused the Ny\u0101ya theories with the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika, and did not regard the Ny\u0101ya as a system independent of the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika.\n\nHari-varman further says, \u201cSome teachers (the S\u0101mkhya) maintain that colour, etc., are nothing but elements (mah\u0101-bh\u016bta), while other teachers (the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika) contend that elements are something different from colour, etc.\u201d\\(^2\\) The statement corresponds to the characteristic of the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika that substances are distinguished from attributes and actions.\\(^3\\) \u201cAccording to the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika the four elements are sometimes\n\np. 308). The substitution of Ny\u0101ya for Na-ya-hsiu-mo depends upon the fact that the sixteen topics seem to be those of the Ny\u0101ya, and the Madhy\u0101ntanugama-s\u0101stra mentions the name in the passage where logical theories are discussed, and ascribes the name to followers of a system of logic. Ci-ts\u0101n in his commentary on the \u015aata-s\u0101stra says that the Mahe\u015bvara(-deva) school has the sixteen topics of logical theory. His enumeration of the sixteen topics exactly agrees with N.S. But he identifies Naya-hsiumo with the Nirgranthas. He also enumerates the sixteen principles of the Nirgranthas, which do not at all agree with N.S. (Dainihon-zoku-z\u014dky\u014d, 73, bk. 5, p. 385b). The Madhy\u0101ntanugama-s\u0101stra also asserts that the Mahe\u015bvara-school is connected with logic. N.S. acknowledges \u012a\u015bvara (4, 1, 19-21) and followers of the Ny\u0101ya have a relation to \u015aaivism, so that the Ny\u0101ya and \u015aaivism were sometimes confused with each other. See Bhandarkar, Vai\u1e63\u1e47avism and \u015aaivism, p. 117; Ny\u0101ya-v\u0101rttika, p. 466 (cf. M\u0101ndukya-k\u0101rik\u0101, 1, 9; Brahmas\u016btra, 2, 1, 33).\n\n\\(^1\\) The mention of the six categories occurs once more on p. 68a.\n\n\\(^2\\) Ch. xxxviii, p. 21b. The Asat-k\u0101rya-v\u0101da is discussed in ch. cli, pp. 78b-79a.\n\n\\(^3\\) This characteristic is refuted by the author in ch. cxliv, pp. 76-77a. The author\u2019s standpoint is not a realistic, but a kind of idealistic one.\nimperceptible,\u201d\u00b9 and \u201cwhen things are destroyed, they pass into atoms.\u201d\u00b2 From these passages it is plain that the term element means atom, and that the author did not distinguish the one from the other; this arises from the fact that the author did not, in his system, acknowledge an atomic theory. In his quotations the atoms are of four sorts.\n\n\u201cThe followers of Ul\u016bka maintain that the touch of earth is neither cold nor hot, and the soft (touch) of wind is explained as in the case of earth; but the touch of water is cold and that of fire is hot (V.S. 2, 2, 4\u20135). . . . Earth alone has the quality of being changed by baking,\u00b3 and this is not the case with water, etc. (7, 1, 6).\u201d\u2074 V.S. does not mention that the touch of earth is neither cold nor hot; but it is stated in Pr. Bh.\u2075 The opinion that cold and hot are included in touch is not known to V.S.\u2076 The reference to the theory of p\u0101kaja is noticeable.\n\nAs for earth, it is said: \u201cQuestion, \u2018The followers of Ul\u016bka contend that smell is an attribute belonging to earth alone (V.S. 2, 2, 2). Is the opinion acceptable or not?\u2019 Answer, \u2018There is, in reality, no substance like earth; this has been explained above. The opinion is, therefore, not correct. Besides, the Va\u00ef\u015be\u1e63ika maintains that white copper, lead, tin, gold, silver, and copper, etc., are included in fire and possess smell in themselves. Consequently, smell is not confined to earth alone . . .\u2019\u201d\u2077 This is an interesting reference.

(e.g. the olfactory organ consists of earth, because) the cognition of smell is produced by reason of the predominance of the attribute (smell in the organ) and of possession of smell. (Similarly water, fire, and wind are the material causes of the organs of taste, sight, and touch respectively, because) the cognitions of taste, colour, and touch are produced (in the organs, in which) water, fire, and wind are predominant.' Is the opinion correct or not?\"\n\n\\footnote{8}{The passage in the Chinese translation cannot be understood literally.

Earth possesses not merely smell, but also other attributes, so that earth is not the material cause (of the olfactory organ). And, as earth originates in an aggregation of many elements (i.e. atoms, according to the other's theory), there is no pure earth apart from water, etc. If the cognition of smell is produced (in the olfactory organ) by reason of possessing smell, the cognitions of colour, etc., must be produced at the same time, because earth possesses the four attributes (i.e. colour, taste, smell, and touch).' Question, 'Smell is possessed by earth alone, and the olfactory organ is terrene, so that the olfactory organ only can perceive smell.' Answer, 'The attributes of earth are nothing but earth; the olfactory organ must perceive all the attributes of earth. Also water alone possesses cold touch, and fire alone possesses hot touch; and cold and heat must be perceived by the tongue and the eyes. But this is not the case. Besides, there are in reality no substances. Consequently the sense-organs cannot be established. And the function of them, i.e. the production of cognitions, comes from contact with substances; but, if there are no substances, there is no contact; nor function of the sense-organs. It is, therefore, impossible that the sense-organs should have definite material causes.'\n\n1 p. 26a. p. 25b: \"Some teachers maintain that (1) in the eyes fire-elements are predominant, because the eyes come from karma's, which possesses a quality similar to the eyes, that is, the eyes are obtained by presenting light to others (in the previous life). (2) The eyes perceive objects by the help of light, and cannot perceive anything without light. Therefore the eyes must have predominance of the fire-element. (3) Fire in general illuminates objects in a distant place; in like manner the eyes perceive coloured objects at a distance, because there is fire in the eyes. (4) After a man has died, the eyes return to the sun, consequently the eyes are known to have the sun as their essence. (5) The eyes perceive colour only; and, as colour is possessed by fire, the eyes perceive, after all, their essence. In this way ether, earth, water, and wind are known to be predominant in the other organs. When a man has died, the organ of hearing returns to ether, because the organ perceives sound, which is\nThe quotation tells us that the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika is of opinion that earth possesses the four attributes, water three, fire two, and wind one; but such earth, etc., are not atoms, because the passage treats them as aggregates. This agrees with V.S.\\(^1\\) But the special attribute of earth is smell, that of water is cold, and that of fire is hot. This also agrees with V.S.\\(^2\\) except that cold and heat are touch. Not only is the relation between the sense-organs and the objects explained as in V.S., but also the opinion that cognition comes from contact is quite correct. In another passage Hari-varman quotes: \u201cCognition is produced by the contact of self with mind. Self is eternal, like sound.\u201d\\(^3\\) The passage, together, with the above long quotation, asserts that self is something different from cognition, and that mind is an indispensable factor in the psychic process. The theory that sound is eternal, like self, is a well-known dogma of the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101. The statement is sometimes confused even with the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101.\n\nAs for the perceptibility of the categories, Hari-varman says: \u201ca certain teacher maintains that number, extension, single individuality,\\(^4\\) conjunction, disjunction, agreeableness, disagreeableness,\\(^5\\) actions, universality, particularity, possessed by ether. The other organs are similarly explained. The conclusion is that each element is predominant in the corresponding organ.\u201d See N.S. 3, 1, 63; 1, 1, 13; 3, 1, 70\u20133, and notes on ch. ii, 1, 6.\n\n\\(^1\\) 2, 1, 1\u20134.\n\\(^2\\) 2, 2, 2\u20135.\n\\(^3\\) p. 42a, pp. 63b, 67b.\n\\(^4\\) Single individuality is literally \u201cone (or sameness) and difference (or separateness)\u201d. This is certainly a translation of eka-prthakta.\n\\(^5\\) Agreeableness and disagreeableness are perhaps corruptions of paratva and aparatva, and may be replaced by priority and posteriority. Ci-ts\u0101h, evidently depending upon this passage, states that unity, difference, conjunction, disjunction, number, extension, agreeableness, disagreeableness\u2014these eight attributes reside in the nine substances. But the first two (unity and difference) cannot be independent of number and extension, or priority and posteriority, so that eight must be seven. He further says that pain, pleasure, aversion, desire, foolishness, cognition, effort, and negligence\u2014these eight reside in self and mind. But foolishness and cognition (lit.\nand (some) substances, although not coloured things, are visible (V.S. 4, 1, 11; 8, 1, 5).\u201d\u00b9 \u201cNumber, extension, single individuality,\u00b2 conjunction, disjunction, agreeableness, and disagreeableness\u00b3\u2014these things each have reality. The s\u016btra of the other system mentions that a pot is something different from pot-ness (ghatatva, cf. V.S. 1, 2, 11\u201316), and that the cognition of a pot presupposes pot-ness (8, 1, 6).\u201d\u2074 \u201cColour residing in substances which are large and more than one is visible (4, 1, 6). Wind is invisible (2, 1, 10).\u201d\u2075\n\nWhen the above passage is compared with the statements that \u201cthe four elements are sometimes imperceptible\u201d, and \u201cwhen things are destroyed, they pass into atoms\u201d, it is seen that all atoms are imperceptible, while substances as aggregates are perceptible upon condition of being large (mahat) and more than one (aneka-dravya); but wind is an exception. These and other points are in agreement with V.S.\n\nPerceptibility of sound is discussed in chapter I, On the Perception of Sound. The qualities of sound affirmed by the other system can be summarized as follows: \u201cSound is an attribute (gu\u1e47a) of ether (V.S. 2, 1, 27). It reaches to the organ of hearing, and causes the cognition (cf. 2, 2, 21). Though sound is an attribute, its transiency is common to action (karma), (2, 2, 25); but sound has, like other attributes, no action, because it is an attribute (7, 1, 15; 7, 2, 12; 7, 2, 25). Sound is produced by conjunction, disjunction, or cleverness in Chinese), being complementary to each other, are a translation of buddhi, and effort (lit. diligence) and negligence are also a translation of prayatna, so that eight must be six. The number of attributes in Ci-ts\u00e4n\u2019s commentary is seventeen (Dainihonzoku-z\u014dky\u014d, 73, bk. 5, pp. 384b, 385a).\n\n\u00b9 p. 30b.\n\u00b2 See n. 4 on the last page.\n\u00b3 See n. 5 on the last page.\n\u2074 p. 44b.\n\u2075 p. 77a.\nanother sound (2, 2, 31). Sound is momentary (k\u1e63anika), as actions are, and continuous (sant\u0101na). These qualities almost agree with V.S. But the qualities of being momentary, like actions, and continuous, are not mentioned in V.S. This is a natural consequence of the qualities of sound stated in V.S.; and these two qualities were accepted for the first time by Pr. Bh. Continuity is also accepted by N.S. (2, 2, 17); but momentariness is rejected (3, 2, 11 f.). If we compare the passage with \"Others say, 'You contend that the cognition of colour is produced without contact of the eyes with coloured objects. This is impossible, because the eyes have light, and the light goes out to contact with the colour (of the objects), and then the cognition is produced,'\" the passages are seen to contain Ny\u0101ya theories. The latter is evidently the Ny\u0101ya theory. Other theories similar to the Ny\u0101ya are found also in chapter cxxix, On Doubt, which may be compared with N.S. 1, 1, 23; its Bh\u0101sya, and 2, 1, 37.\n\nThe most important reference is the following: \"In substances which have no (distinct) attributes the attribute is produced by conjunction with fire, that is, the original black colour is destroyed and the red colour is produced.\"\n\nThis refers to the theory of p\u0101kaja. The Vai\u015be\u1e63ika theory of p\u0101kaja is different from the Ny\u0101ya theory. The former is called the P\u012blu-p\u0101ka-v\u0101da, while the latter is named the Pi\u1e6dhara-p\u0101ka-v\u0101da. As stated above, Hari-varman knew the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika theory of p\u0101kaja; but this reference is more similar to the Ny\u0101ya\n\n---\n\n1 p. 28a f., and chs. xlix, lvi.\n2 pp. 287\u20138.\n3 p. 28h.\n4 N.S. 3, 1, 30\u201350.\n5 p. 28h.\n6 Pr.

Ind.), p. 466; Ny\u0101ya-ko\u015ba, p. 455 f.; Cowell, Sarva-dar\u015bana-sa\u1e43graha, pp. 154\u20135.\nthan to the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika. At least such a process is not explained in V.S. But N.S. says, \"Or as the blackness of an atom is not eternal.\" Thus the Ny\u0101ya is always confused with the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika, or the former is regarded as a complement to the latter.\n\nHari-varman also states that the Br\u0101hma\u1e47a has six sorts of duty, the K\u1e63attriya four sorts, the Va\u1e47ya, three sorts, and the \u015a\u016bdra one, according to a Dharma-s\u016btra, and that it is not sin, but a cause of good rewards, for the K\u1e63attriya to kill others in order to protect another from danger. The author denies not merely the last permission, but also the injunction of the Veda, which permits to kill animals for sacrifice. \"Question, 'There is no guilt on the part of a man who commits robbery for the support of his parents, as a Dharma-s\u016btra allows: a man may steal food from a \u015a\u016bdra when he has been without food for seven days; stealing in such cases is, for him, not guilty. When his life is in danger, stealing food from a Br\u0101hma\u1e47a tends not to sin, even though he is not really righteous, because he is in a crisis. Like ether, which cannot be defiled by anything, he is not stained' (cf. Upask\u0101ra on 6, 1, 12).\" Answer, 'A certain s\u016btra of the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as says, \"when a Br\u0101hma\u1e47a is about to commit robbery, if the possessor of things comes to prevent it, he must deliberate on both himself and the possessor. If the possessor be inferior to himself, he may put the possessor to death (V.S. 6, 1, 14), because\n\n1 N.S. 4, 1, 67, \"anu-\u015by\u0101mat\u0101'nityatvavad v\u0101\"; 3, 2, 77, \"anu-\u015by\u0101mat\u0101-nityatvavad etat sy\u0101t\" (this, an opponent will say, may be just like the eternity of the blackness of an atom), is rejected by the author of N.S.\n\n2 Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha-dharma-s\u016btra (SBE.), 2, 13 f.; Manu, x, 75 f. Cf. \u0100pastamba, 2, 5, 10, 4 f.; Gautama, 10, 1, f.; Baudh\u0101yana, 1, 10, 18, 2 f.; Pr. Bh., pp. 272\u20133.\n\n3 p. 47a. Also the passage says that one who dies on the battle-field goes to heaven, as a verse asserts that one who dies in a campaign (goes to heaven) and is selected by angels as their companion. This may be compared with the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 or other works.\nhe, being superior to the possessor, can atone for his deed by confession or some other means. In the case of an equal suicide and killing the other have the same degree of sinfulness (6, 1, 15), because the sin is so grave that it is difficult to dispel it. In the case of a superior suicide is to be committed (6, 1, 16), because the sin, if one kills the possessor, cannot be atoned for. In like manner plunder and murder must be discriminated . . . \u201d\u201d 1\n\nThese permissions are one of the characteristics of the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika, which seems to be a survival of the Akriy\u0101-v\u0101da, as stated above. That Hari-varman calls the s\u016btra a s\u016btra of the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as, or a Br\u0101hmanical s\u016btra, may show that the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika had been acknowledged as a Br\u0101hmanical system.\n\n7. The preceding long extracts from the works of N\u0101g\u0101rjuna, Deva, and Hari-varman agree with V.S. so well that the date of the s\u016btra can be assigned to a time little earlier than the three great Buddhists. We are perhaps quite safe in concluding that V.S. had been composed before Hari-varman; otherwise the fact of so many passages agreeing with V.S. can hardly be understood. Besides, Hari-varman\u2019s work shows that there were many different opinions prevailing among followers of the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika before his time, to say nothing of the follower of the system, who disputed with him, as stated in his Life. On the other hand, N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s and Deva\u2019s works do not offer evidences with respect to the variant opinions of the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika; they seem to represent the doctrines contained in V.S. Deva\u2019s mention of the fourth and the fifth category exactly agrees with V.S., as proved later on. The fact is explained, if we suppose that N\u0101g\u0101rjuna and Deva knew the s\u016btra and did not pay attention to the different opinions, because according to the Jaina record\n\n1 pp. 47a, b.\nthere existed different opinions among the followers of the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika.\n\nJacobi's researches into the dates of the s\u016btras of the six systems fix the date of V.S. at about 200\u2013500 A.D., and Suali, following Jacobi's proof, places the date in 250\u2013300 A.D.\u00b9 Jacobi bases his proof mainly upon the relation of the s\u016btras to the Buddhist schools, the \u015a\u016bnya-v\u0101da and the Vij\u00f1\u0101na-v\u0101da. V.S. does not directly relate to the Buddhist schools. Consequently he deduces the date from the date of N.S.\u00b2 But, as stated above, V.S. is quoted by the author of N.S., and such quotations are found in the work of N\u0101g\u0101rjuna; and Deva makes a complement to N\u0101g\u0101rjuna's quotations. Therefore, V.S. would appear to have been composed before N\u0101g\u0101rjuna. But the date of V.S. cannot be earlier than Roha-gutta and A\u015bva-gho\u1e63a. The conclusion is that V.S. was composed about 50\u2013150 A.D. If N\u0101g\u0101rjuna is not so early as 113\u2013213, the date of V.S. will be placed at a time later than 50\u2013150 A.D. At any rate the date is earlier than N\u0101g\u0101rjuna, and the contents of V.S. do not contradict this supposition.\u00b3\n\n\u00b9 JRAS. 1914, p. 1091.

He says, \"The V.D. is probably as old as the N.D.; for V.D. iv, 1, 6, is twice quoted by V\u0101tsy\u0101yana, namely, in his comment on N.D. iii, 1, 33 and 69; and V.D. iii, 1, 16, is quoted by him in his comment on N.D. ii, 2, 36; and Uddyota-kara quotes the V.D. several times simply as the s\u016btra or the \u015b\u0101stra, and once calls its author Paramar\u1e63i, a title accorded only to ancient writers of the highest authority.\"\n\u00b3 The S\u0101\u1e41khya had already been systematized before 300 B.C., although the works of the S\u0101\u1e41khya are not so early. The allusion in V.S. to the S\u0101\u1e41khya is intelligible from this fact. S.K. is said to have been composed at the time of Vasu-bandhu, because the author, I\u015bvara-kr\u1e63\u1e47a, is traditioned to have been a contemporary of Vasu-bandhu. Vasu's commentary has a noticeable passage: \"The S\u0101\u1e41khya-s\u016btra says that sacrifice is avoidable, because it is connected with impurity, decay, and excess\" (p. 39b). S.K. v. 2, \"dr\u1e63\u1e6davad \u0101nu\u015bravik\u0101\u1e25 sa hy avi\u015buddhi-ksay\u0101ti\u015b\u0101yayuktah.\" The S\u0101\u1e41khya had a work before the S.K. (v. 72); see Schrader, Das \u015aa\u1e63\u1e6di-tantram (ZDMG., vol. lxviii, pp. 101 f., 1913);\nXIII. VAI\u015aE\u015aIKA DOCTRINES: 1. GENERAL\n\nWe have now finished our researches into the date of the Vai\u015be\u015bika-s\u016btra. The next task is to study the historical development of the Vai\u015be\u015bika doctrines and historically to connect the doctrines contained in the present treatise with those generally set forth. For the former N.S. and its Bh\u0101sya must be carefully examined, because they share an important part in the history of the Vai\u015be\u015bika. The later Vai\u015be\u015bika was affected by the Ny\u0101ya in its logical theories, but the influence upon its other philosophical theories is not so great. On the other hand, the Ny\u0101ya introduced the Vai\u015be\u015bika doctrines into its system. Consequently it is not necessary for the present task to trace the development in this connexion. Our present purpose is to connect our treatise with the Vai\u015be\u015bika doctrines. Its relation to V.S. and Pr. Bh. will be studied in the following notes. Here we shall try to collect from Chinese translations some materials concerning the fourth and the fifth category.\n\n2. The different opinions stated in Hari-varman's work are partly preserved in Pr. Bh. and partly accepted by the Naiy\u0101yikas and the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101kas. These different opinions are scarcely contained in our treatise. The most obvious divergence from V.S. and Pr. Bh. is undoubtedly the ten categories. Among these ten the fourth (universality) and the fifth (particularity) are interesting from the historical point of view.\n\nIn Deva's \u015aata-\u015b\u0101stra and Vasu's commentary on it the categories are six in number. In the work itself the sixth category (inherence) is not clearly described. But\n\nProfessor Garbe, S\u0101\u1e45khya-Philosophie (pp. 57-60, 32-4); Pa\u00f1ca\u015bikha, Festgruss an R. von Roth (p. 75). The well-known eight causes of imperceptibility (S.K. v. 7) are found in N\u0101g\u0101rjuna's Dv\u0101da\u015ba-dv\u0101ra-\u015b\u0101stra (ch. ii, p. 67b), Satya-siddhi-\u015b\u0101stra (ch. xlvii, p. 27b, more than eight).\nBh\u0101va-viveka, an eminent follower of his,\\(^1\\) states that Deva had disproved that category.\n\nThe explanation of universality and particularity in the \u015aata-\u015b\u0101stra agrees with V.S. Universality includes existence (satt\u0101) on the one hand and pot-ness (gha\u1e6datva) on the other hand. Existence is eternal and has reality apart from the things in which it resides. In another respect also pot-ness is included in particularity. Consequently, universality and particularity are relative, like father and son, the latter also being father of his own son. Universality is possible by dependence on particularity; without particularity universality cannot be established.\\(^2\\)\n\nFrom the explanation of pot-ness we gather that substance-ness (dravyatva), attribute-ness (gunatva), and action-ness (karmatva), are similarly explained, and are either universality or particularity. The ultimate particulars (antya-vi\u015be\u1e63a) are not alluded to; but, if we compare the explanation of pot-ness with that of atoms, the latter would appear to have been so named.\\(^3\\) There are no such subdivisions of universality and particularity as stated in the Jaina record and in Pr. Bh.\n\nEven in Hari-varman\u2019s work there is no trace of different opinions concerning universality and particularity. The works of Asa\u1e45ga and his brother Vasu-bandhu supply no material on this point. Dig-n\u0101ga\u2019s Hetu-vidy\u0101-ny\u0101ya-dv\u0101ra-\u015b\u0101stra\\(^4\\) states as follows: \u201cThe perceptions of (substances), pot, etc., (attributes), number, etc., (actions), throwing upwards, etc., (universality), existence, and (particularity), pot, etc., are false perceptions (pratyak\u1e63\u0101bh\u0101sa),\u201d because these perceptions are altogether conceptual and mediate perceptions (savikalpaka-\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Praj\u00f1\u0101-dipa-\u015b\u0101stra, p. 119a.\n\n\\(^2\\) \u015aata-\u015b\u0101stra, ch. iii, pp. 41b\u201342a; ch. iv, pp. 42b\u201343a; \u015aata-\u015b\u0101stra-raiputya, ch. vi, p. 51a.\n\n\\(^3\\) The ultimate particulars are the nine substances as causes\u2014the four atoms, ether, time, space, self, and mind.\n\n\\(^4\\) No. 1223 = No. 1224, p. 3a = p. 8a.\npratyak\u1e63a),\u00b9 and are not immediate (nirvikalpaka-pratyak\u1e63a).\u00b9 The sixth category, inherence, is not enumerated in the passage, because inherence is imperceptible; accordingly, the passage shows that the categories are six. If universality is confined to existence and excludes pot-ness, particularity must include pot-ness as well as other sorts of the lower universality (apara-s\u0101m\u0101nya, in Pr. Bh.). But in the passage pot is enumerated among substances and as particularity, so that universality must contain both existence and other sorts of the lower universality. Universality and particularity also agree in Dig-n\u0101ga's work with V.S.\n\n\u015aa\u1e45kara-sv\u0101min, a disciple of Dig-n\u0101ga, offers an important testimony in the course of illustrating, in his Hetu-vidy\u0101-ny\u0101ya-prave\u015ba-\u015b\u0101stra,\u00b2 contradictory reasons\n\n\u00b9 As for these terms see notes on ch. i, 3, 12 (cognition).\n\u00b2 pp. 10\u201311a (No. 1216). Vidy\u0101-bh\u016b\u1e63ana, in his History of the Medieval School of Indian Logic (p. 89), ascribes the Ny\u0101ya-prave\u015ba to Dig-n\u0101ga, and identifies it with the Ny\u0101ya-dv\u0101ra-\u015b\u0101stra (No. 1223 = No. 1224), relying upon a Tibetan tradition. But in Chinese the two works are quite different. No. 1216 is called, according to Kwh\u0113i-c\u012b's transliteration, Hetu-vidy\u0101-ny\u0101ya-prave\u015ba-\u015b\u0101stra, the Tibetan title being Tshad-ma-rigs-par-bjung-pa\u1e25-sgo (Pram\u0101\u1e47a-ny\u0101ya-prave\u015ba-dv\u0101ra), while No. 1223 = No. 1224 is Hetu-vidy\u0101-ny\u0101ya-dv\u0101ra-\u015b\u0101stra. The contents of the Ny\u0101ya-prave\u015ba as given in Vidy\u0101-bh\u016b\u1e63ana's work exactly agree with this No. 1216, but not with No. 1223 = 1224. Kwh\u0113i-c\u012b and other disciples of Yuan Chwang, the translator of the works, assert that \u015aa\u1e45kara-sv\u0101min was a disciple of Dig-n\u0101ga, and No. 1216 was \"composed by the Bodhi-sattva \u015aa\u1e45kara-sv\u0101min\", as the Chinese translation asserts. No. 1223 = 1224, and the Pram\u0101\u1e47a-\u015b\u0101stra-prave\u015ba in Vidy\u0101-bh\u016b\u1e63ana's work (p. 100, sec. 60), would appear to be the same, because he remarks that \"it was translated into Chinese by the Chinese interpreter Thasan-tsan (Hh\u00fcen-Thsang = Yuan Chwang), and the Chinese version was translated into Tibetan\". The Tibetan title is stated to be Tshad-mah-i-bstan-bcos-rig-pa-la-bjung-pa (Pram\u0101\u1e47a-\u015b\u0101stra-ny\u0101ya-prave\u015ba); but according to Cordier's Catalogue du Fonds Tib\u00e9tain (p. 435) the Tibetan titles have been interchanged by Vidy\u0101-bh\u016b\u1e63ana, and the Ny\u0101ya-prave\u015ba must be the same work as No. 1216, since Cordier attaches the Chinese title of the latter. Hence the contents of the Ny\u0101ya-prave\u015ba must be those of No. 1216. There seems to be confusion in Vidy\u0101-bh\u016b\u1e63ana's treatment of the works. The ascription of the Ny\u0101ya-prave\u015ba\nregarding existence on the part of the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika. It runs\u2014\n\n\"Existence is neither a substance, nor an attribute, nor an action;\nBecause of possessing one substance and attributes and actions,\nLike universality-particularity.\"\u00b9\n\nIn this case existence is only universality, and particularity is called universality-particularity (s\u0101m\u0101nya-vi\u1e63e\u1e63a). Universality-particularity can never be two categories, otherwise the reasoning is a kind of petitio principii.\n\nDharma-p\u0101la, in his Vij\u00f1apti-m\u0101trat\u0101-siddhi-\u015b\u0101stra\u00b2 and Vaipulya-\u015bata-\u015b\u0101stra-vy\u0101khy\u0101,\u00b3 mentions the fourth and the fifth category. The Vai\u015be\u1e63ika in these works holds the doctrines of the six categories, \"you advocate the six categories.\"\u2074 And the six categories are substance, attribute, action, existence (universality), universality-particularity, and inherence.\u2075 In many passages\u2076 he refutes the reality of the six categories. His accounts of the fourth and the fifth category are summarized as follows:\u2014\n\nto Dig-n\u0101ga is not correct. Vidy\u0101-bh\u016b\u1e63ana translates the passage thus: \"S\u0101m\u0101nya (generality) is neither substance, quality, nor action. Because it depends upon one substance and possesses quality and action (p. 95)\". According to the Chinese translation there is the example \"like s\u0101m\u0101nya-vi\u1e63e\u1e63a\". Without the example the illustration can hardly be intelligible.\n\n\u00b9 V.S. 1, 2, 8, \"dravya-guna-karmabhyo 'rth\u0101ntaram satt\u0101\"; 2, 2, 23, \"ekadravyavattv\u0101n na dravyam\"; 1, 2, 9, \"gu\u1e47a-karmasu ca bh\u0101v\u0101n na karma na gu\u1e47\u0101\u1e25\"; (1, 2, 7, \"sad iti yato dravya-guna-karmasu s\u0101 satt\u0101\").\n\n\u00b2 No. 1197.

Existence is common to all things, so that it is called universality.\\(^1\\) Existence is something different from substances, attributes, and so on.\\(^2\\) It has reality and is perceptible, depending upon its substratum.\\(^1\\) Consequently, existence is one, and the cause of the cognitions with regard to all things that they are existent.\n\nUniversality-particularity as the fifth category includes substance-ness, attribute-ness, action-ness, and earth-ness,\\(^2\\) colour-ness, pot-ness, cow-ness (\\textit{go-tva}),\\(^3\\) etc. It is also something different from the substrata. Things are common to one another in one respect, but they are particular in the other respect.\\(^4\\) Universality-particularity is manifold\\(^5\\) and pervades the substrata. It is real, eternal, and perceptible. Like existence, universality-particularity is the cause of its cognition. Whether the category includes the ultimate particulars is not clearly stated; but it is inferred from the explanation of atoms and of the process of their combination that it does include them.\n\nIn Roha-gutta\u2019s opinion universality was divided into three: \\textit{mah\u0101-s\u0101m\u0101nya}, \\textit{satt\u0101-s\u0101m\u0101nya}, and \\textit{s\u0101m\u0101nya-vi\u015be\u1e63a-s\u0101m\u0101nya}. These three subdivisions resolve themselves, as a logical consequence, into two subdivisions, the highest universality (\\textit{para-s\u0101m\u0101nya}), and the lower universality (\\textit{apara-s\u0101m\u0101nya}), which were accepted by Pr. Bh. According to Pr. Bh. the highest universality is nothing but existence, and the lower universality includes all sorts of universality with the exception of existence and the ultimate particulars, the latter of which are particularity.\\(^6\\) And Pra\u015basta-p\u0101da remarks that\n\n\\(^1\\) No. 1198, pp. 100\\(\\alpha\\), 112\\(\\alpha\\).\n\\(^2\\) No. 1197, p. 2b.\n\\(^3\\) No. 1198, p. 100\\(\\alpha\\).\n\\(^4\\) p. 112\\(\\alpha\\).\n\\(^5\\) p. 81\\(\\alpha\\).\n\\(^6\\) Pr. Bh., pp. 11\u201313, 311\u201322.\nexistence is the only proper universality, and the lower universality is also called particularity, but the ultimate particulars are not called universality. Dharma-p\u0101la's account of universality (existence) exactly corresponds to the higher universality in Pr. Bh., while universality-particularity includes the lower universality and particularity. If the highest universality is the only proper universality there can hardly be reason for classifying the lower universality under the fifth category universality. In consequence of this the category universality-particularity was established. As the lower universality was classified under the fifth, the name of the fifth category was changed from particularity into universality-particularity.\n\n\u015aa\u1e45kara-sv\u0101min, as a disciple of Dig-n\u0101ga, must have lived in the fifth-sixth century, and he was almost a contemporary of Pra\u015basta-p\u0101da. Consequently, the change of particularity into universality-particularity took place about the time of Pra\u015basta-p\u0101da.\u00b9\n\nBut our treatise differs from these in regard to this point, because it enumerates existence or universality, universality-particularity, and particularity as three distinct categories.\n\nPra\u015basta-p\u0101da and the other authority adduced by \u015aa\u1e45kara-sv\u0101min and Dharma-p\u0101la have the common opinion that universality can be limited to existence only. And the former maintains that the ultimate particulars are only particularity. Therefore, the lower universality is a medium between universality proper and particularity proper. The ultimate particulars can, as the name itself proves, never be universality. If so, the ultimate particulars cannot logically be classified under universality-particularity, because they are only particularity. The logical consequence has been followed by the author of\n\n\u00b9 Cf. Sapta-pad\u0101rth\u012b of \u015aiv\u0101ditya (Vizianagram Skt. S., vol. vi): \"s\u0101m\u0101nyam param aparam par\u0101param ca-iti trividha\u1e41\" (p. 12).\nour treatise, and universality-particularity is established as a category distinct from particularity.\n\nThe later Vai\u015be\u1e63ika, subsequent to \u015aiv\u0101ditya and Udayana, acknowledged non-existence as a seventh category. Non-existence is affirmed in V.S., but it is not a category. If this establishment of a seventh category can be justified, the establishment of the three distinct categories, universality, universality-particularity, and particularity in the treatise, may also claim to be justified.\n\nAs for the other categories (potentiality, non-potentiality, and non-existence), they are not historical developments, but are directly derived from the s\u016btra. Consequently, they will be treated in the following notes.\n\n3. Our main task is almost finished; but we shall proceed to collect some miscellaneous accounts of the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika.\n\n(a) Asa\u1e45ga wrote many voluminous works, but he did not refer to the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika as his predecessors did. He distributed the doctrines of other systems than Buddhism into sixteen classes.\\(^1\\) Even in those classes the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika is not clearly indicated.\n\n(b) Vasu-bandhu is also a great writer; but distinct references by him to the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika are exiguous. We shall extract two passages from his works. In the Karma-siddha-prakara\u1e47a-\u015b\u0101stra\\(^2\\) he states that, \u201cKa\u1e47\u0101da\\(^3\\) maintains that atoms conjoin with one another and produce effects (aggregates). The cognition of length is produced by seeing the long side (of an object), that of shortness is by seeing the short side. The cognition of\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Yog\u0101c\u0101rya-bh\u016bmi-\u015b\u0101stra (No. 1170), ch. iii, p. 3 f.; Prakara\u1e47\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a-v\u0101c\u0101-\u015b\u0101stra-k\u0101rik\u0101 (No. 1202), p. 89a; Prakara\u1e47\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a-v\u0101c\u0101-\u015b\u0101stra (No. 1177), ch. ix, pp. 33a\u2013b. The first is ascribed to the Bodhi-sattva Maitreya, but it is naturally by Asa\u1e45ga.\n\n\\(^2\\) No. 1221 = No. 1222; p. 90b = 95a. The former was translated in 651 A.D. and the latter in 541.\n\n\\(^3\\) In one of the two translations Ka\u1e47\u0101da is rendered (\u201cthe system of) corn-piece-eater\u201d. This is also found in No. 1198, p. 92b.\nsquare comes from the equal length of the four sides, and that of sphericity from things globular in all the sides. The cognition of height is produced from the convex form, and that of lowness from the concave form. The cognition of flatness comes from the even surface of things, and that of unevenness comes from the jagged surface. When things possessing various colours are rotating, the cognition of variegated colour is produced.\" V.S., Pr. Bh., and our treatise mention small (anu), large (mahat), short (hrasva), long (d\u012brgha), and spherical (p\u0101rima\u1e47\u1e0dalya); but this passage explains them in detail. Among followers of the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika these explanations were probably adopted, because they appear to be quite natural.\n\nIn the Buddha-gotra-\u015b\u0101stra\u00b9 Vasu-bandhu refutes the realism of the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika in respect to sound. He says that \"the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika maintains that sound is of three sorts\u2014sound destroyed by the effect, sound destroyed by the cause, and sound destroyed by both\". These qualities of sound correspond to the theory of momentariness of sound in the Satya-siddhi-\u015b\u0101stra and Pr. Bh. But they are, for the first time, distinctly mentioned in our treatise. Vasu-bandhu also mentions that sound as an attribute cannot, according to the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika, possess any attribute. This is a very important doctrine of the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika. Vasu, commenting on the \u015aata-\u015b\u0101stra, says that \"sound can, according to the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika,\u00b2 neither be called great nor be called low (small)\". The meaning is that \"great (large)\" and \"small\", being attributes, cannot qualify sound at all.\n\nThe above passages do not supply important materials; but they prove that some doctrines, which are not found in V.S. and Pr. Bh., and are met with in our treatise, are not originated by the author of the treatise and existed before his time.\n\nAs to emancipation (mok\u1e63a, apavarga, nih\u015breyasa), V.S.\n\n\u00b9 No. 1220, pp. 76a-b.\n\u00b2 \u015aata-\u015b\u0101stra, p. 48b.\ndoes not clearly mention it,\\(^1\\) while Pr. Bh. fully describes it.\\(^2\\) In this matter Chinese translations supply some materials.\n\nDeva states in his \u015aata-\u015b\u0101stra\\(^3\\): \u201cThe other says, there is emancipation, which is eternal and has no distress (kle\u015ba). Emancipation is the mental state free from distress (S\u016btra).\u201d The Vai\u015be\u1e63ika\u2019s concept of emancipation seems to be negative, as in the case of other systems, although the system is not at all pessimistic.\\(^4\\)\n\nVasu remarks in another passage that disciples of Ul\u016bka recite the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika-s\u016btra, which, in a passage relating to the category \u201cattribute\u201d, says that, when a man washes his body (in the River Ga\u1e45g\u0101) thrice a day and offers something to fire, etc., twice a day, a kind of good is produced in, and resides in, himself.\\(^5\\) Ci-ts\u0101n explains the passage in his commentary: \u201cWashing one\u2019s body is preparatory to the production of good, because washing purifies, while offering fire, etc., produce good. But such a kind of good is not the final good and only leads to heaven.\u201d\\(^6\\) This is called an exaltation (abhyudaya),\\(^7\\) and is different from the highest good (nih\u015breyasa) in V.S.\n\n(c) Param\u0101rtha (499\u2013569 A.D.) describes the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika doctrines in the Laksan\u0101nus\u0101ra-\u015b\u0101stra\\(^8\\): \u201cAccording to the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika self (\u0101tman) has fourteen sorts of mark, i.e. the five external and the nine internal (V.S. 3, 2, 4).

The work is ascribed to Gu\u1e47a-mati, a disciple of Vasu-bandhu, but the extant work is not Gu\u1e47a-mati\u2019s original, because the contents evidently confute the authorship of Gu\u1e47a-mati.

The latter are the following: The system maintains that self is eternal, and mind (manas) is as regards extension atomic (anu) \\((3, 2, 5; 7, 1, 23)\\), but is also eternal \\((3, 2, 2)\\). There are merit \\((dharma)\\) and demerit \\((adharma)\\) apart from these.\\(^1\\) Merit is good and demerit is evil. They lead to contact of self with mind. Nine things are produced from the contact. From self and mind comes cognition \\((buddhi)\\), which recognizes everything. From cognition come pleasure \\((sukha)\\) and pain \\((duhkha)\\). Pleasure and pain produce desire \\((iccha)\\) and aversion \\((dvesa)\\), i.e. desire is caused by pleasure and aversion is by pain. Desire and aversion produce effort \\((prayatna)\\). By effort pain is avoided and pleasure is sought. Effort produces merit and demerit.\\(^1\\) Eternalists \\((S\u0101\u015bvata-v\u0101din)\\) believing in existence in a future life practise asceticism in the present life; this is merit;\\(^2\\) while Exterminationalists \\((Ucchedav\u0101din)\\), rejecting the future life, do not control their minds and commit evil; this is demerit. From merit and demerit comes impression \\((sa\u1e41sk\u0101ra = bh\u0101van\u0101)\\). Impression is the cause which reminds us of past events \\((9, 2, 6\u20138)\\). Merit and demerit, i.e. \\(adr\u0325\u1e63\u1e6da\\),\\(^2\\) remain after the present merit and demerit have gone away, and afterwards combine with self and produce a new merit and demerit, as stated above. Merit and demerit, i.e. \\(adr\u0325\u1e63\u1e6da\\), cause the following five activities: the upward flaming of fire, the sideward blowing of wind \\((5, 2, 13)\\), the falling down and sinking of earth and water \\((5, 1, 7; 5, 1, 18; 5, 2, 3)\\), the conjunction (and disjunction) of atoms with (and from) one another \\((5, 2, 13)\\), and the contact of self with mind \\((5, 2, 13; 5, 2, 17; 9, 2, 6)\\)...\n\n\"The t\u012brthaka maintains that there are two kinds of dissolution of the world \\((sa\u1e41vara)\\), the antara-sa\u1e41vara\n\n\\(^1\\) 3, 1, 18; 3, 1, 19; 3, 2, 1; 3, 2, 3; 3, 2, 19; 5, 2, 13; 5, 2, 15; 1, 2, 17; 6, 2, 2; 6, 2, 12; 6, 2, 3; 6, 2, 14; 1, 1, 4.\n\n\\(^2\\) See Pr. Bh., p. 10, and notes on ch. i, 3, 22\u20133 (merit and demerit).\nand the *tejah-samvarta*. The former has the duration of 300,000 *kot\u012bs* (*kot\u012b* = ten millions), that is, three *kalpas* of 100,000 *kot\u012bs*. The first *kalpa* of 100,000 *kot\u012bs* is the period of a fire-world, the second of a water-world, and the third of a wind-world. During the first *kalpa* the world is created and dissolved, and so in the second and the third. At the time of dissolution every gross thing is dissolved into its component atoms, which exist without conjunction with one another throughout the period. At the time of creation, merit and demerit, i.e. *adr\u015bta*, cause the combination of atoms. The combination of atoms through, or with, merit brings about *sugati*, while the combination through, or with, demerit brings about *durgati*. By combination atoms grow bigger and bigger and produce the whole world. Self and mind conjoin with, and are disjoined from, each other, when atoms do the same. After the three *kalpas* the *antara-samvarta* is over, and there comes the *tejah-samvarta*. When three *kalpas* of the *tejah-samvarta* have elapsed, all atoms exist without conjunction with one another, and self and mind also exist without conjunction. At that time self is in temporary emancipation. Afterwards merit and demerit, i.e. *adr\u015bta*, cause the conjunction of self with mind...\n\nOne who seeks eternal emancipation ought to devote himself to morality (*\u015b\u012bla*), liberality (*d\u0101na*), asceticism (*tapas*), and *yoga*. From these four sorts of practice is produced the supreme merit which leads to the attainment of emancipation or heaven. The supreme merit brings about exaltation (*abhyudaya*) and knowledge of truth (*tattva-j\u00f1\u0101na*). Exaltation is enjoyment of pleasure in heaven. Knowledge of truth leads to eternal emancipation (i.e. *nih\u015breyasa*), when merit and demerit, i.e. *adr\u015bta*, have been completely destroyed, and self and mind never come into conjunction with each other, that is, when the nine\n\n---\n\n1 V.S. 6, 1, 5-6, 2, 9; 5, 2, 15-18; 6, 2, 14-16.\nthings are no more produced. The whole doctrine set forth depends upon the concepts of self and atoms.\"\n\nThis statement agrees generally with V.S., but it is not exactly the same. The nine things, as the attributes of self, are not clearly stated in V.S. Pr. Bh.\\(^1\\) tries, for the first time, to prove the nine things to be attributes of self. The proof evidently shows that Pr. Bh. is the first work to enumerate the nine attributes of self.\\(^2\\) And the theory of the antara-samivarta and the tejah-samivarta is also not found in V.S., although the dogma of transmigration suggests the introduction of the theory of creation and dissolution into the system. V.S. does not undertake to explain the process of creation, etc., but it tries to explain the construction or the state of the world. Pr. Bh. explains the process of creation (s\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6di) and dissolution (sa\u1e41h\u0101ra).\\(^3\\) As for the way to and the means of the attainment of emancipation, Pr. Bh.\\(^4\\) agrees with the above statement more exactly than does V.S. These three points prove that Param\u0101rtha's statement came from Pr. Bh., and that Param\u0101rtha is later than Pra\u015basta-p\u0101da.\n\n(d) Lastly, Dharma-p\u0101la is important. He says: \"The Vai\u015be\u1e63ika maintains that, if the causes of pleasure and pain have been completely destroyed, and attachment to things has been rooted out, self becomes entirely alone (kevala), free from disturbances, and is in accordance with its real nature. Self in this state is not active any more, but absolutely happy and eternal. This is emancipation.\"\\(^5\\)\n\n\\(^1\\) pp. 67\u201370.\n\\(^2\\) p. 10, \"gun\u0101\u1e25 r\u016bpa - rasa - gandha - spar\u015ba - sanikhy\u0101 - parim\u0101\u1e47a - prthaktva - sa\u1e41yoga - vibh\u0101ga - pratva - aparatva - buddhi - sukha - du\u1e25kha - icch\u0101 - dve\u1e63a - prayatn\u0101\u015b ca - iti ka\u1e47\u1e6dha - ukt\u0101\u1e25 saptada\u015ba; ca - \u015babda - samuccit\u0101\u015b ca gurutva - dravatva - sneha - sa\u1e41sk\u0101ra - ad\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da (i.e. dharmadharma) - \u015babd\u0101\u015b ca sapta - eva - ity - eva\u1e41 catu\u1e41 vi\u1e41\u015bati - gun\u0101\u1e25.\" The passage proves that Pr.

Bh., pp. 281-2, we find them both in agreement.\n\nDharma-p\u0101la, from his own standpoint, refutes the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika's concept of self, which is something different from cognition, and he enumerates the nine attributes of self, pleasure, pain, desire, aversion, effort, merit, demerit, impression, and cognition. These attributes pervade the substratum self.\n\nMind is, according to his statement, corporeal, and its extension is the same as that of atoms (param\u0101nu), i.e. spherical (p\u0101rima\u1e47\u1e0dalya). V.S. ascribes the extension of atoms (anu) to mind; but the s\u016btra does not use the term param\u0101nu, which is found in Pr. Bh. In the latter work the term anu is not the designation of atoms, but one of the five sorts of extension (parim\u0101na). If mind is called anu in the sense of Pr. Bh.'s terminology, the extension of mind must be the same as that of binary atomic compounds (dvya\u1e47uka) and non-eternal. The passage, therefore, suggests that Dharma-p\u0101la knew the distinction between param\u0101nu and anu. Consequently, we may conclude that the passage depends upon Pr. Bh.\n\nHe further states that \"followers of Ul\u016bka say that the sense-organs, the eyes, etc., consist of fire-, ether-, earth-, water-, and wind-substance in order. The eyes perceive three substances: fire, earth, and water, and especially colour. The skin perceives four substances out of the five, excepting ether, and especially touch. The ear perceives sound, the nose perceives smell, and the tongue taste\". V.S. does not assert that ether is the material cause of the ear. Otherwise ether must be an element (bh\u016bta). But in V.S. ether is the cosmical vacuum. Pr. Bh. reckons ether as one of the five elements, and as the material\n\n---\n\n1 No. 1198, p. 84b.\n2 p. 81a.\n3 See notes on ch. i, 3, 6 (extension).\n4 No. 1198, p. 109a.\n5 p. 24.\ncause of the organ (indriya-prak\u1e5bti). The passage is proved to have come from Pr. Bh.\n\n\"The Vai\u015be\u1e63ik\u0101 maintains that the sixth category (inherence) is one in its reality and pervades its substrata. Inherence is supersensuous (atindriya) and imperceptible (apratyak\u1e63a).\"\u00b9 These qualities of inherence are not exactly stated in V.S.,\u00b2 but they are clearly mentioned in Pr. Bh.\u00b3 Also the classification of substances into eternal and non-eternal, corporeal and incorporeal, and the classification of attributes into those pervading the substrata and those not pervading, etc., agree with Pr. Bh. Moreover, the explanations of the categories, except the fourth and the fifth,\u2074 exactly agree with Pr. Bh.\n\nThe classifications of substances and attributes are also mentioned in our treatise. Besides, the two sorts of causes, eternal and non-eternal, and the contradictory and non-contradictory relations between causes and effects, e.g. between conjunction and actions, and between two actions, etc.,\u2075 which are mentioned in the treatise, are found in Dharma-p\u0101la's works.\n\nDharma-p\u0101la quotes some interesting opinions:\u2014\n\nSome of the Vai\u015be\u1e63ikas are of opinion that \"colour, etc., are the real objects and possess universality-particularity. The objects are perceived by the eyes, etc., in consequence of the impression (sa\u1e43sk\u0101ra)\u2076 of colour, etc.\" Another contends that \"substances are perceptible in consequence of containing more than one substance, and in consequence of colour. Without these two conditions they are imperceptible, like wind and atoms\". Another holds that \"substances are perceptible in consequence of colour,\n\n\u00b9 No. 1198, p. 100b; No. 1187, p. 2b.\n\u00b2 Cf. 7, 2, 13; 7, 2, 26-8.\n\u00b3 p. 329.\n\u2074 Dharma-p\u0101la knows the theory of p\u0101ka-ja (No. 1198, p. 114b).\n\u2075 No. 1198, pp. 114b, 117b.\n\u2076 See V.S. 4, 1, 5-6.\netc. But in hot water water hides the colour of fire, so that fire, though existent in water, cannot be perceived\u201d. In a certain work (\u015b\u0101stra) of the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika some teachers refute this opinion and say that \u201cwhen a white cloth has been dyed with blue or other colour, white cloth is not perceived any more, but it cannot be contended that the cloth also is not perceived. When the blue colour is perceived, the essence\\(^1\\) of the blue colour is also perceived. The essence of the blue colour is inherent in the cloth, consequently the cloth is perceived at the same time when the blue colour is perceived. In like manner, though the colour of fire is not perceived, fire can be perceived, when water is perceived in consequence of colour, because fire is conjunct with water\u201d.\\(^2\\)\n\nThe first two opinions are found in V.S. as well as in Pr. Bh.; but the latter two can be traced neither in the two works nor in our treatise. From these passages we may conclude that there were many different opinions among the Vai\u015be\u1e63ikas before Dharma-p\u0101la. Kwh\u0113i-ci\u2019s mention of the eighteen schools of the system, though it cannot be accepted as it stands, is to some extent true. And it is confirmed by the record of the Jaina schism, by the Satya-siddhi-\u015b\u0101stra, and by the commentaries on V.S. The author of the treatise may not be considered as the representative of his time; but contemporary works, if any, are either non-existent or not yet discovered, and the treatise has a close relation to V.S. and Pr. Bh., so that the author plays a significant part in the history of the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika.\n\nXIV. THE Ny\u0101ya: 1. KNOWN TO Deva, ETC.\n\n1. A few remarks on the Ny\u0101ya may be added.

And even \u0100\u015bva-gho\u1e63a knew the five-membered (pa\u00f1ca-avayava) reasoning, as shown in what follows.\n\nIn the S\u016btra\u1e45k\u0101ra he states: \"Kau\u015bika said to his friend: 'The \u015a\u0101\u1e45khya-s\u016btra (i.e. the theories of the \u015a\u0101\u1e45khya) may essentially be summarized in the five-membered reasoning: 1, thesis (pratij\u00f1\u0101); 2, reason (hetu); 3, example (ud\u0101hara\u1e47a or d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101nta); 4, application (upanaya); and 5, conclusion (nigamana). But the \u015a\u0101\u1e45khya-s\u016btra cannot supply any example, . . . because . . . the \u015a\u0101\u1e45khya-s\u016btra explains that pradh\u0101na (= prak\u1e5bti) is not produced by any other thing; it has an eternal nature, and produces all things; it is universally pervading (vibhu), and (at the same time) penetrates everywhere\u00b2 (sarva-gata). The explanation contains a contradiction, because there is in the world nothing such as to produce other things and never to be produced by anything else. Also, a thing which is universally pervading and penetrates everywhere is proved to have been wrongly conceived. An universally pervading thing cannot move anywhere, and a thing which moves cannot be universally pervading; the concepts are inconsistent with each other . . .'\"\u00b3\n\nJacobi remarks on Kau\u1e6dilya's saying (\u015a\u0101\u1e45khya\u1e41 Yogo L\u014dk\u0101yata\u1e41 ca-ity \u0101nvik\u1e63ik\u012b) that \"Wir haben jetzt die Gewissheit, dass \u015a\u0101\u1e45khya und Yoga schon 300 v.

If the S\u0101\u1e41khya was employing logical demonstration in 300 B.C., the S\u0101\u1e41khya of the time of A\u015bva-gho\u1e63a may possibly have introduced the five-membered reasoning into the system.\n\n2. The essential and characteristic feature of the Ny\u0101ya is the five-membered reasoning. Accordingly, the systematization of the Ny\u0101ya mode of reasoning is earlier than the Christian era. As for the origin of the Ny\u0101ya, we can trace it at the time of Mah\u0101-v\u012bra and Buddha. The Jaina canons hold that there are four sorts of hetu (= pram\u0101\u1e47a, means of knowledge), which are exactly the same as those in the Ny\u0101ya, and employ a primitive form of reasoning. The Brahma-j\u0101la-sutta tells us that there were many teachers addicted to logic (tarkin) and reasoning (m\u012bm\u0101\u1e41sin).\n\nBut argumentation naturally prevailed among philo-\n\n---\n\n1 Zur Fr\u00fchgeschichte der indischen Philosophie, p. 738.\n2 The S\u0101\u1e41khya system is very logical, as seen in S.K. S.K., v. 5, defines anum\u0101na \"tal-li\u1e45ga-li\u1e45gi-p\u016brvakam\". The definition may be taken to mean the abstract and universally valid relation between the middle (li\u1e45ga) and the major term (li\u1e45gin), i.e. vy\u0101pti. If this is really the case, the definition favours the supposition that S.K. adopts the three-membered reasoning, which is more advanced than the five-membered; and some verses in S.K. really propound the three-membered reasoning (vv. 9, 15\u201318). But according to the Gauda-p\u0101da-bh\u0101\u1e63ya on that verse the definition does not always represent the universally valid relation; and, also, according to Kum\u0101rila's \u015aloka-v\u0101rttika (Anum\u0101na-pariccheda, v. 143), the Vindhya-v\u0101sins (\u012a\u015bvara-kr\u1e63\u1e47a, the author of S.K., etc.) did not know the universal vy\u0101pti, but only the vy\u0101pti which is valid in special cases. And the verses in S.K. are necessarily short, because they are in the \u0100ry\u0101 metre. Besides, the commentary on S.K. in the Chinese translation and the Gauda-p\u0101da bh\u0101\u1e63ya always use the five-membered reasoning. Consequently the S\u0101\u1e41khya is proved to have used the five-membered reasoning even at the time of \u012a\u015bvara-kr\u1e63\u1e47a and his followers. Such is the case with N.S. as well as V.S. The three-membered reasoning was elaborated by Dig-n\u0101ga for the first time in the history of Indian logic (No. 1223 = No. 1224, p. 2b = p. 7b).\n\n3 As for the term hetu in this sense, see before. According to Colebrooke the four sorts of pram\u0101\u1e47a are acknowledged by the Ny\u0101ya only.\n4 Vidy\u0101-bh\u016b\u1e63ana, History of the Medieval School of Indian Logic, pp. 4\u20135.\n5 Ibid., p. 60.\nsophers even in early times. A remarkable example is found in the *Brhad-\u0101ra\u1e47yaka-upani\u1e63ad* (the third *adhy\u0101ya*), and the *Ch\u0101ndogya-upani\u1e63ad* (7, 1, 2) reckons *V\u0101kov\u0101kya* (*Dialogue*)\\(^1\\) as one of the sciences at that time. But these cannot be regarded as the direct origin of the Ny\u0101ya reasoning.\n\nThe establishment of a kind of syllogistic form seems to have been necessitated by Sa\u00f1jaya Vela\u1e6d\u1e6dhi-putta and other sophists. Mah\u0101-v\u012bra was forced to establish the *Sy\u0101dv\u0101da* (*Sapta-bha\u1e45g\u012b-naya*) and the *Nayas*. Buddha had a special mode of answering questions.\\(^2\\) A Jaina sage, Bhadra-b\u0101hu (died 293 B.C.),\\(^3\\) elaborated a syllogistic form with ten members (*da\u015ba-avayava-v\u0101kya*).\\(^4\\) This form appears to forestall the five-membered form of the Ny\u0101ya; but another syllogistic form with ten members, which is set forth by V\u0101tsy\u0101yana,\\(^5\\) may have preceded the five-membered form. The first five of the ten members are, as V\u0101tsy\u0101yana asserts, superfluous as members of a syllogistic form.\n\nIn the times previous to the author of *N.S.* there were a great many sophists, as seen from the fifth chapter of *N.S.*, where the twenty-four kinds of futility (*j\u0101ti*), and the twenty-two kinds of \u201cunfitness to be argued with\u201d (*nigraha-sth\u0101na*) are mentioned. Futility is also mentioned\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Logic, according to \u015aa\u1e45kara and to Max M\u00fcller\u2019s translation.\n\n\\(^2\\) This is called the *catv\u0101ri ry\u0101kara\u1e47\u0101ni*, viz. *ek\u0101\u1e47sa-ry\u0101kara\u1e47a*, *vibhajya-ry\u0101kara\u1e47a*, *paripr\u014dch\u0101-ry\u0101kara\u1e47a*, and *sth\u0101panya-ry\u0101kara\u1e47a*.

Also the *Maha-praj\u00f1\u0101-p\u0101ramit\u0101-s\u0101stra* often refers to it (vol. xxxv, p. 85b, etc.).\n\n\\(^3\\) Jacobi, *Kalpa-s\u016btra*, p. 11; SBE., vol. xxii, p. xlii.\n\n\\(^4\\) Vidy\u0101-bh\u016b\u1e63ana, loc. cit., pp. 6\u20137; Leumann, ZDMG., xlvi, p. 649.

The agreement evidently shows that the \u201cunfitness to be argued with\u201d in this work was derived from N.S.\n\n3. The date of N.S. has been discussed by Jacobi and Suali, as stated above. The former places the date in 200\u2013500 A.D., while the latter places it in 300\u2013350. The basis which Jacobi took for his argument is the fact that N.S. attacks the theory of \u015a\u016bnya-v\u0101da, but the Vij\u00f1\u0101na-v\u0101da is not alluded to.\n\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna, discussing *pram\u0101\u1e47a* in his *Vigraha-*\n\n---\n\n1 No. 1257, translated by Kekaya in 472 A.D.\n2 No. 1252, translated by Param\u0101rtha in 550 A.D.\n3 No. 1223 = No. 1224, translated by Yuan Chwang and by I-tsing.\n4 Ch. iii, *Nigraha-sth\u0101na*, p. 72a. Dharma-gupta, a Buddhist of Southern India, came to China in 590 A.D. and died in 619 A.D. (Nanjio\u2019s App. II, 131). According to his *Life* (No. 1493, p. 92b, No. 1485, p. 66b) he read the work in Sh\u0101-l\u014d (a province of Chinese Turkestan), when on the way to China. What he read consisted of 2,000 \u015blokas. But the extant work consists of about 330 \u015blokas. Some of the oldest Catalogues, Nos. 1604, 1609, mention that the book is in 2 vols., but the extant one is in 1 vol. And the beginning of the work clearly shows that it is only a concluding part of the original. It has only three sections in a chapter, apparently the last, called *Paripr\u015bcch\u0101*, (1) \u201cwrong refutation\u201d, (2) \u201ctrue refutation (of j\u0101ti)\u201d, and (3) *nigraha-sth\u0101na*. The work is sometimes ascribed to Vasu-bandhu, but this is doubtful. Param\u0101rtha commented on it, but the commentary (3 vols.) has been lost (No. 1504, pp. 56b, 92a, No. 1609, p. 111a, No. 1483, p. 77b). He also translated the *Nigraha-sth\u0101na-\u015b\u0101stra* (1 vol.), the *Paripr\u015bcch\u0101-\u015b\u0101stra* (1 vol.), and the *Ca\u1e45-shuco- (or lun-) t\u0101o-li-lun* (1 vol.); and he wrote a commentary (5 vols.) on the last, called the *Explanation of the Ca\u1e45-lun*. All have been lost. *Ca\u1e45-shuco- (or lun-) t\u0101o-li* literally means \u201ccorrectly (truly) explaining reason (or reasoning)\u201d, which may have been the translation of Ny\u0101ya. Yuan Chwang translates Ny\u0101ya by \u201ctrue reason (or reasoning)\u201d (*Ca\u1e45-li*). If so, the *Ca\u1e45-shuco- (or lun-) t\u0101o-li-lun* may have been a translation of N.S. That the commentary consisted of 5 vols. suggests the five adhy\u0101yas of N.S.\nvy\u0101vartan\u012b says: \"If a pram\u0101\u1e47a can establish objects, the pram\u0101\u1e47a needs also to be established by another pram\u0101\u1e47a. What sort of pram\u0101\u1e47a can establish the pram\u0101\u1e47a? If (you say that) the pram\u0101\u1e47a is established without another, your argument is incoherent and defective, so that another reason should be offered. If (you say that) the pram\u0101\u1e47a is compared to the light of a lamp, which illuminates both itself and other things\u2014so that the pram\u0101\u1e47a can establish itself and other objects, your argument is a mistake, because the light does not illuminate itself like a pot in the dark, and illuminating itself is inconsistent with illuminating other things.\"\n\nN.S. says, pram\u0101\u1e47ata\u1e25 siddhe\u1e25 pram\u0101\u1e47\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 pram\u0101\u1e47a-antara-siddhi-prasa\u1e45gah, tad-viniv\u1e5btter v\u0101 pram\u0101\u1e47a-siddhi-vat tat-siddhih, na prad\u012bpa-prak\u0101\u015ba-siddhi-vat tat-siddhe\u1e25, and kvacit tu niv\u1e5btti-dar\u015ban\u0101d aniv\u1e5btti-dar\u015ban\u0101c ca kvacid anek\u0101nta\u1e25 (2, 2, 17\u201319).

A pot is dark in a dark room, before it has been illuminated. Just so in the case of illuminating itself. But the light is not dark; consequently it cannot illuminate itself.\n\n5 Ballantyne: \"Since it is by Pr\u014dofs (pram\u0101\u1e47a) that the existence of Proofs is established, the existence of other Proofs presents itself (for demonstration).\"\n\n6 Ballantyne: \"Or in the absence thereof (\u2014i.e. of Proof,\u2014since Proof may, in virtue of itself, be Proof), then, just as Proof is established (independently), so may this (viz. right knowledge, independently of any cause of it) be established.\" The translator of the Vighrahavy\u0101vartan\u012b may have understood -v\u0101 pram\u0101\u1e47a-siddhi-vat as -v\u0101-a-pram\u0101\u1e47a-siddhi-vat.\n\n7 Ballantyne: \"It is not so (\u2014that an endless series of Proofs of Proofs are required\u2014), because it (viz.

Ind.) or by the Ny\u0101ya-s\u016btra-v\u1e5btti of Vi\u015bva-n\u0101tha; but V\u0101caspati-mi\u015bra enumerates it as a s\u016btra in his Ny\u0101ya-s\u016bci-nibandha (App. in the Ny\u0101ya-v\u1e5bttika, Bibl. Ind.).\ncompare the latter with the former, we can hardly deny the relationship between the two passages. The Vigraha-vy\u0101var\u0101\u1e47\u012b is principally engaged in refuting the realistic explanation of pram\u0101\u1e47a and prameya (objects of pram\u0101\u1e47a) and establishing the author\u2019s idealistic system. Pram\u0101\u1e47a\u2019s are enumerated as four: perception (pratyak\u1e63a), inference (anum\u0101\u1e47a), analogy (upam\u0101\u1e47a), and trustworthy instruction\u00b9 (\u015babda). The refutation in this work of the relation between pram\u0101\u1e47a and prameya, and the answer and the attack by N.S. on the \u015a\u016bnya-v\u0101da, may lead to the supposition that the s\u016btra was composed about the same time as N\u0101g\u0101rjuna and Deva, in order to protect the realistic standpoint against their attack. If such be the case, the date of N.S. may be placed in 150\u2013250 A.D.\n\n4. As stated above, N.S. was commented upon by an unknown author before V\u0101tsy\u0101yana. The next extract from Pi\u1e45gala\u2019s commentary on the M\u0101dhyamika-s\u016btra seems to represent an explanation of inference earlier than V\u0101tsy\u0101yana\u2019s Bh\u0101sya. But it cannot be ascertained whether Pi\u1e45gala quoted from the commentary by the unknown author or not.\n\n\u201cIf you argue that the existence of self is established by pram\u0101\u1e47a, this is not possible, because the four sorts of pram\u0101\u1e47a cannot support it. The four sorts are, namely, 1, perception (pratyak\u1e63a); 2, inference (anum\u0101\u1e47a), e.g. we infer the existence of fire from smoke; 3, analogy (upam\u0101\u1e47a), e.g. for people who have not as yet seen brass, brass is compared to gold; and 4, trustworthy instruction (\u0101pta-vacana = \u015babda), e.g. in assertions like \u2018there exist hell (narak\u0101), heaven (svarga), and the Uttara-kurus (a kind of paradise)\u2019, which are altogether unascertainable\n\n\u00b9 The Up\u0101ya-kaushalya-h\u1e5bdaya-s\u016btra also enumerates four, Asa\u1e45ga enumerates three, pratyak\u1e63a, anum\u0101\u1e47a, and \u015babda (No. 1170, pp. 65a\u201368b), while Dig-n\u0101ga admits only two, pratyak\u1e63a and anum\u0101\u1e47a. Dig-n\u0101ga says, \u201c\u015babda and upam\u0101\u1e47a are contained in pratyak\u1e63a and anum\u0101\u1e47a\u201d (No. 1223 = No. 1224, p. 3a = p. 8a). After Dig-n\u0101ga all Buddhists admit only two.\nby perception, but are believed upon the authority of trustworthy instruction.\\(^1\\) The existence of self can never be proved by any sort of pram\u0101\u1e47a; that is to say, existence is not proved by perception or by inference. Inference is reasoning concerning an object which has not yet been experienced from an object which has been seen, e.g. if a man has ever seen that, where smoke is, there is fire,\\(^2\\) he can afterwards infer the existence of fire from seeing smoke. This is not applicable to the proof of self. If you argue, \u2018we can prove\u2019 the existence of self from seeing the five skandhas, because we have seen that self conjoins with the five skandhas. This is also supported by the following sorts of reasoning. There are three sorts of inference, p\u016brvavat, \u015be\u1e63avat, and s\u0101m\u0101nyato dr\u1e63\u1e6da.\n\nThe p\u016brvavat is the reasoning in which a man has formerly known that where smoke is there is fire, and afterwards infers the existence of fire, as in the former cases (p\u016brvavat), from seeing smoke.\\(^3\\) The \u015be\u1e63avat is the reasoning in which a man, having known that one grain of rice has been cooked, can infer from that that all other grains in the cooking kettle have also been cooked.\\(^4\\) The s\u0101m\u0101nyato dr\u1e63\u1e6da is the reasoning in which a man, having seen that another person has started from one place and arrived at another, and having hence known that he is locomotive, can infer from that that the sun has\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Cf. Gau\u1e0da-p\u0101da-bh\u0101\u1e63ya on S.K., v. 4.\n\n\\(^2\\) Literally, \u201cif a man has once seen that fire has smoke, afterwards he can infer the existence of fire from seeing smoke.\u201d The first part is not strictly logical, but it may be justified if the author means the first experience, which is followed by the knowledge of the concomitant relation between fire and smoke, when the experience is repeated.\n\n\\(^3\\) This is the second explanation of the p\u016brvavat in Vatsyayana\u2019s Bh\u0101\u1e63ya. The Bh\u0101\u1e63ya says, \u201cp\u016brvavad iti yatra yath\u0101 p\u016brvam pratya-k\u1e63abh\u016btayor anyataradar\u015banena-anyatarasya-apratyak\u1e63asya-anum\u0101naun, yath\u0101 dh\u016bmena-agnir iti\u201d (p. 13).\n\n\\(^4\\) This example is not found in the Bh\u0101\u1e63ya. A similar example is used in the Gau\u1e0da-p\u0101da-bh\u0101\u1e63ya on S.K., v. 5, \u201c\u015be\u1e63avad yath\u0101 samudr\u0101d ek\u0101\u1e41 jalapalam lavanam \u0101\u015b\u0101dy\u0101 \u015be\u1e63asya-apy asti lavanabhl\u0101va iti.\u201d This has the same meaning as the above. See notes on ch. i, 3, 12 (cognition).\nmotion, though not seen, because the sun moves from the east to the west.\\(^1\\) In like manner pain, pleasure, aversion, desire, and cognition, etc., are known to have a substratum, just as a people has the king as supporter;\\(^2\\)\u2014this is not possible. The reason is that in the procedure of the *s\u0101m\u0101nyato dr\u1e63\u1e6da* we infer that the sun has motion, because we have observed its change of place; but in the case of self its existence cannot possibly be inferred from the five *skandhas*, because the conjunction of self with the *skandhas* has not been observed. In the same way existence is not proved by trustworthy instruction, because trustworthy instruction has its origin in perception. Consequently, self cannot be concluded to be something existent.\u201d\\(^3\\)\n\nV\u0101tsy\u0101yana explains the three sorts of inference in two ways. According to the first of these the *p\u016brvavat* is reasoning from cause to effect, i.e. from the present to the future, and the *\u015be\u1e63avat* is reasoning from effect to cause, i.e. from the present to the past, while the *s\u0101m\u0101nyato dr\u1e63\u1e6da* occurs only in the present.\\(^4\\) This explanation was followed by the unknown commentator on *S.K.* in the Chinese translation. The second explanation is more logical, and almost agrees with Pi\u1e45gala\u2019s, as stated above. The *p\u016brvavat* in the second explanation is after all the same as the *\u015be\u1e63avat* in the first, as V\u0101tsy\u0101yana suggests,\\(^5\\) including the *p\u016brvavat* in the first explanation. The *s\u0101m\u0101nyato dr\u1e63\u1e6da* in both the first and the second explanation is the same reasoning as Pi\u1e45gala\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) This is the first explanation of *s\u0101m\u0101nyato dr\u1e63\u1e6da* in the *Bh\u0101\u1e63ya*. The same explanation is found in the *Gau\u1e47a-p\u0101da-bh\u0101\u1e63ya* and \u015aabarasv\u0101min\u2019s *Bh\u0101\u1e63ya* on *M.S.* (p. 10).\n\n\\(^2\\) The *Bh\u0101\u1e63ya* by V\u0101tsy\u0101yana, \u201c... yath\u0101-icch\u0101-\u0101dibhir \u0101tm\u0101 icch\u0101-\u0101dayo gun\u0101\u1e25 gun\u0101\u015b ca dravya-samsth\u0101n\u0101\u1e25 tad yad e\u1e63\u0101\u1e41 sth\u0101nam sa \u0101tm\u0101-iti\u201d (p. 14).\n\n\\(^3\\) No. 1197, ch. xviii, p. 43b.\n\n\\(^4\\) V\u0101tsy\u0101yana says, \u201ctrik\u0101la-yukt\u0101 arth\u0101 anum\u0101nena g\u1e5bhyante\u201d (p. 14).\n\n\\(^5\\) See n. 3, p. 87.\nexplains it. Then there is no logical reason for the \u015be\u1e63avat in the first explanation; hence, the \u015be\u1e63avat has to be explained after Pi\u1e45gala\u2019s manner and Vatsy\u0101yana\u2019s second explanation\u00b9; they are complementary to each other. It appears that Vatsy\u0101yana intended in his Bh\u0101\u1e63ya to comprise and unite different explanations.\n\n5. It has been stated that Deva and Hari-varman did not distinguish the Ny\u0101ya school from the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika, or rather they did not regard the Ny\u0101ya as a system distinct from the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika. Pi\u1e45gala and Vasu may have been of the same opinion, because, commenting on the works of N\u0101g\u0101rjuna and Deva, they did not make a distinction between the two systems and confused the Ny\u0101ya theories with the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika.\n\nSuch a tendency is also found even among followers of the Ny\u0101ya; since the author of the s\u016btra uses the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika theories, Vatsy\u0101yana and Uddyota-kara use the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika theories many times, and Uddyota-kara calls Ka\u1e47\u0101da Paramar\u1e63i, and the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika-s\u016btra the \u015b\u0101stra or the s\u016btra. Followers of the two systems, at least the Naiy\u0101yikas, did not disapprove of this attitude. Handt holds the opinion that the name Vai\u015be\u1e63ika in early times must have included followers of Ka\u1e47\u0101da and Gotama. Br\u0101hma\u1e47as and Buddhists usually reckon them as followers of one system. Even \u015aa\u1e45kara, naming the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika system the school of Kana-bhuj, criticizes the Ny\u0101ya theories in the course of his refutation of the former. In M\u0101dhava\u2019s Sarva-dar\u015bana-sa\u1e43graha the term Ny\u0101ya is only applied to the theory of logic.\u00b2\n\n\u00b9 \u015ae\u1e63avan n\u0101ma pari\u1e63e\u1e63ah sa ca prasakta-prati\u1e63edhe \u2019nyatara-aprasa\u1e45gac ch\u012b\u1e63yam\u0101ne sa\u1e43pratyayah.

The division between v\u012bta and av\u012bta in anum\u0101na is, as the writer asserts, dependent upon the Ny\u0101ya-ko\u015ba, p. 728 (n.), not for the first time established by V\u0101caspati-mi\u015bra. It has been used by Uddyota-kara in his Ny\u0101ya-v\u0101rttika, p. 126.\n\n\u00b2 Die atomistische Grundlage der Vai\u015be\u1e63ika-Philosophie, p. 26.\nAccording to Hall's Bibliography \\(^1\\) V\u0101caspati-mi\u015bra wrote works or commentaries on the five systems other than the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika. In his case the Vai\u015be\u1e63ik\u0101 is probably considered as included in the Ny\u0101ya; he wrote the *Ny\u0101ya-v\u0101rttika-t\u0101tparya-\u1e6d\u012bk\u0101*. \\(^2\\) Udayana \\(^3\\) wrote on the one hand a commentary on *Pr. Bh.*, named *Kir\u0101\u1e47\u0101val\u012b*, and a pure Vai\u015be\u1e63ika work called the *Lak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101val\u012b* \\(^4\\); and on the other the *Ny\u0101ya-v\u0101rttika-t\u0101tparya-pari\u015buddhi* and the *Kusum\u0101\u00f1jali*. \\(^5\\) The *Kusum\u0101\u00f1jali* is a Ny\u0101ya work, because Udayana enumerates the four sorts of *pram\u0101\u1e47a*. \\(^6\\) He himself is an eminent Naiy\u0101yika. In this work Udayana proves the existence of Param\u0101tman, i.e. \u012a\u015bvara, and states the fourteen different opinions relating thereto. \\(^7\\) The Naiy\u0101yika is one of them, but the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika is not enumerated. In the *Kir\u0101\u1e47\u0101val\u012b* he also states the different opinions of the S\u0101\u1e45khya, the Yoga, the Ved\u0101nta, and the Taut\u0101tita \\(^8\\) concerning emancipation (*apavarga*). If Udayana had considered the Ny\u0101ya a distinct system from the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika, he would have referred to the Ny\u0101ya in the *Kir\u0101\u1e47\u0101val\u012b* (a Vai\u015be\u1e63ika work). If his not having done so is due to being a Naiy\u0101yika,\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) p. 87. Cf. Woods, *Yoga-system of Pata\u00f1jali*, p. xxi.\n\n\\(^2\\) Published in Vizianagram Skt. S., vol. xiii.

See *Upask\u0101ra* on 7, 2, 20, *Viv\u1e5bti*, p. 461. Here the Taut\u0101tita is the representative of the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e41sakas.\nhe would have cited the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika instead of the Ny\u0101ya in the Kusum\u0101\u00f1jali (a Ny\u0101ya work). We face a dilemma in this point. If we suppose that he considered the two systems as one school, the dilemma can easily be solved. V\u0101caspati-mi\u015bra also, being his predecessor and following V\u0101tsy\u0101yana and Uddyota-kara, will not have made a distinction between the two schools. It may therefore be concluded that there were some teachers, even in the Ny\u0101ya, who did not regard the Ny\u0101ya as a distinct school. The facts that the term Ny\u0101ya as the name of a school is hardly found in the Chinese translation of the Tripitaka, except in the Satya-siddhi-\u015b\u0101stra and the Madhy\u0101nt\u0101nugama-\u015b\u0101stra, and that Buddhist writers often confuse the Ny\u0101ya with the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika, are probably due to this tendency. Udayana's enumeration of the four systems, which includes the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika and the Ny\u0101ya, as the representative schools, shows that in those days there was a growing tendency to reckon the so-called six systems as one group, since in earlier times the six systems (\u1e63a\u1e0d-dar\u015bana) seem not to have been regarded as a group.\nDASAPADARTHI\n\nA TREATISE ON THE TEN CATEGORIES OF THE VAISESIKA\n\nChapter I\n\nIndividual Properties of the Ten Categories\n\nSection 1.\u2014Ten categories\n\nThere are ten categories: 1, substance; 2, attribute; 3, action; 4, universality; 5, particularity; 6, inherence; 7, potentiality; 8, non-potentiality; 9, commonness; and 10, non-existence.\n\nSection 2.\u2014Substance\n\nWhat is the category substance? Nine substances are called the category substance.\n\nWhat are the nine substances? 1, earth; 2, water; 3, fire; 4, wind; 5, ether; 6, time; 7, space; 8, self; and 9, mind\u2014these are the nine substances.\n\nWhat is earth? That which has colour, taste, smell, and touch (as its attributes) is called earth.\n\nWhat is water? That which has colour, taste, touch, fluidity, and viscosity (as its attributes) is water.\n\nWhat is fire? That which has colour and touch (as its attributes) is fire.\n\nWhat is wind? That which has touch only (as its attribute) is wind.\n\nWhat is ether? That which has sound only (as its attribute) is ether.\n\nWhat is time? That which is the cause of the notions of simultaneity, non-simultaneity, slowness, and quickness with respect to that and this (thing) is time.\nWhat is space? That which is the cause of the notions of the east, the south, the west, and the north, etc., is space.\n\nWhat is self? That of which the recognition of an inherent cause of cognition, pleasure, pain, desire, aversion, effort, impression, merit, and demerit, etc., is the mark (of its existence) is self.\n\nWhat is mind? That of which the recognition of a non-inherent cause (for the production) of cognition, pleasure, pain, desire, aversion, effort, merit, demerit, and impression is the mark (of its existence) is mind.\n\nSection 3.\u2014Attribute\n\nWhat is the category attribute? Twenty-four attributes are called the category attribute.\n\nWhat are the twenty-four attributes? 1, colour; 2, taste; 3, smell; 4, touch; 5, number; 6, extension; 7, individuality; 8, conjunction; 9, disjunction; 10, priority; 11, posteriority; 12, cognition; 13, pleasure; 14, pain; 15, desire; 16, aversion; 17, effort; 18, gravity; 19, fluidity; 20, viscosity; 21, impression; 22, merit; 23, demerit; and 24, sound\u2014these are the twenty-four attributes.\n\nWhat is colour? Colour is the quality which has one (substance) as its substratum and is perceived by the eyes.\n\nWhat is taste? Taste is the quality which has one (substance) as its substratum and is perceived by the tongue.\n\nWhat is smell? Smell is the quality which has one (substance) as its substratum and is perceived by the nose.\n\nWhat is touch? Touch is the quality which has one (substance) as its substratum and is perceived by the skin.\n\nWhat is number? Number is the qualities, unity, and so forth, which are inherent in every substance and the cause of the notions with respect to one substance and more than one, etc., that that is one and they are more than one, etc.\nWhat is extension? Smallness, largeness, shortness, length, and sphericity, etc., are called extension.\n\nSmallness is the quality which has a binary atomic compound as its inherent cause and the cause of the notion with respect to one substance, which is produced by two (atoms), that that is small.\n\nLargeness is the quality which is caused by plurality, is inherent in a ternary atomic compound, etc., which arise from a kind of aggregation, and the cause of the notion that one substance is large.\n\nShortness is the quality which has a binary atomic compound as its inherent cause, and the cause of the notion with respect to one substance, which is produced by two (atoms), that that is short.\n\nLength is the quality which is caused by plurality, is inherent in a ternary atomic compound, etc., which arise from a certain aggregation, and the cause of the notion that one substance is long.\n\nSphericity is of two kinds: (1) absolute minuteness and (2) absolute largeness.\n\nAbsolute minuteness is the quality which is possessed by, and inherent in, atoms, and the cause of the notion with respect to one substance that that is absolutely minute.\n\nAbsolute largeness is the quality which is inherent in the substances ether, time, space, and self, and the cause of the notion with respect to one substance that that is absolutely large. It is also called all-pervading.\n\nWhat is individuality? Individuality is the qualities, single individuality, and so forth, which are inherent in every substance, and the cause of the notions with respect to one and more than one substance that that is individual.\n\nWhat is conjunction? It is called conjunction when two separated things come to conjoin with each other.\n\nIt is of three kinds: (1) conjunction produced by the\naction of one of the two conjunct things, (2) conjunction produced by the actions of both, and (3) conjunction produced by conjunction.\n\nThe conjunction produced by the action of one of the two conjunct things is that which is produced by an active and an inactive thing.\n\nThe conjunction produced by the actions of both is that which is produced by two active things.\n\nThe conjunction produced by conjunction is that in which an inactive thing, which consists of many substances, conjoins with ether, etc., when the thing is produced (by the conjunction of them).\n\nWhat is disjunction? Disjunction is the separation of two conjoined things from each other.\n\nIt is of three kinds: (1) disjunction produced by the action of one of the disjunct things, (2) disjunction produced by the actions of both, and (3) disjunction produced by disjunction.\n\nThe disjunction produced by the action of one of the disjunct things and the disjunction produced by the actions of both are explained by the analogy of the conjunctions.\n\nThe disjunction produced by disjunction is that in which a formerly produced substance disjoins (part from part) through another cause, and then from ether, etc., after the substance has been destroyed.\n\nWhat is priority? Priority is the quality which is produced by one substance, upon which depends the notion of remoteness (of another substance) occupying the same time, etc., and the cause of the notion that that is remote.\n\nWhat is posteriority? Posteriority is the quality which is produced by one substance, upon which depends the notion of nearness (of another substance) occupying the same time, etc., and the cause of the notion that that is near.\nWhat is cognition? That by which every object is understood is cognition.\n\nIt is of two kinds: (1) perception and (2) inference.\n\nPerception is the sensory representation which is originated when sense-organs and so on come into contact with colour and so on, residing in appreciable substances.\n\nInference is of two kinds: (1) inference from seeing a common property, and (2) inference from not seeing a common property.\n\nInference from seeing a common property is reasoning which produces knowledge of an inferred object, the whole of which is not seen, by seeing the inferential mark, by recollecting the connection of the inferential mark with the inferred, and by contact of self with mind.\n\nInference from not seeing a common property is reasoning which produces all kinds of knowledge of any invisible objects by seeing the cause of, the effect of, or a thing conjunct with them, or by seeing a thing inherent in the same object, or a thing contradictory to them, by recollecting the connection with each (of the five objects), and by contact of self with mind.\n\nWhat is pleasure? Pleasure is the quality of one substance, self, and its nature is satisfaction.\n\nWhat is pain? Pain is the quality of one substance, self, and its nature is suffering.\n\nWhat is desire? Desire is the quality which is inherent in one substance, self, and attaches to colour, etc.\n\nWhat is aversion? Aversion is the quality which is inherent in one substance, self, and shuns colour, etc.\n\nWhat is effort? Effort is the quality which is inherent in one substance, self, and is volition which is produced by contact of self with mind caused by desire and aversion.\n\nWhat is gravity? Gravity is the quality which is\ninherent in the substances earth and water, and the cause of falling down of one substance.\n\nWhat is fluidity? Fluidity is the quality which is inherent in the substances earth, water, and fire, and the cause of flowing of one substance.\n\nWhat is viscidity? Viscidity is the quality which is inherent in the substance water, and the cause of cohering into one substance, like earth, etc.\n\nWhat is impression? Impression is of two kinds: (1) cause of reminiscence and (2) cause of actions.\n\nThe cause of reminiscence is that which is inherent in self, and it is a particular mental impression produced by the impressions of the perceptive and the inferential knowledge of one substance.\n\nThe cause of actions is impetus, which is produced by actions arising from impulsion, etc., and has one substance as its substratum, and is possessed by corporeal substances. This sort of impression is (identical with) impetus.\n\nWhat is merit? Merit is of two kinds: (1) activity and (2) cessation.\n\nActivity is the cause of (bringing about) pleasure in a desirable body, etc., is inherent in self, and destroys one substance by its effect.\n\nCessation is the cause of (obtaining) delight in perfect cognition, which is free from attachment, is inherent in self, and destroys one substance by its effect.\n\nWhat is demerit? Demerit is the cause of pain and imperfect cognition, is inherent in self, and destroys one substance by its effect.\n\nWhat is sound? That which has one (substance) as its substratum and is perceived by the ears is sound.\n\nSection 4.\u2014Action\n\nWhat is the category action? Five actions are called the category action.\n\nWhat are the five actions? They are: (1) action\nthrowing upwards, (2) action throwing downwards, (3) action contracting, (4) action expanding, and (5) action going.\n\nWhat is the action throwing upwards? The action throwing upwards is the cause of the disjunction of the (formerly) conjunct, like atoms, etc., in the direction of upper and lower, in the intermediate directions, and in ether, etc., and has one substance as its substratum.\n\nWhat is the action throwing downwards? The action throwing downwards is the cause of the conjunction of the disjunct, like atoms, etc., in the direction of upper and lower, in the intermediate directions, and in ether, etc., and has one substance as its substratum.\n\nWhat is the action contracting? The action contracting abides in large and long substances, has one substance as its substratum, and is the cause of the disjunction in which a thing (regarded as) fixed in the near end connects with the near region separating from the other region.\n\nWhat is the action expanding? The action expanding abides in large and long substances, has one substance as its substratum, and is the cause of the disjunction in which a thing (regarded as) fixed in the near end disjoins from the near region connecting with the other region.\n\nWhat is action going? The action going is that which can be inherent in every corporeal substance, has one substance as its substratum, and is the cause of conjunctions and disjunctions (in order).\n\nSection 5.\u2014Universality\n\nWhat is the category universality? The category universality is existence.\n\nWhat is existence? Existence is that which is inherent in all (things belonging to the following) categories, substance, attribute, and action, perceived by all the sense-organs, and the cause of the recognitions with\nrespect to substances, attributes, and actions that they are existent.\n\nSection 6.\u2014Particularity\n\nWhat is the category particularity? The category particularity is that which exists in substances only, has one substance as its substratum, and the cause of the intellection of excluding others and determining the one.\n\nSection 7.\u2014Inherence\n\nWhat is the category inherence? The category inherence is that which is the cause of the recognition with respect to the inseparable connection among substances, etc., that (the one) is here (in the other); its reality is one.\n\nSection 8.\u2014Potentiality\n\nWhat is the category potentiality? The category potentiality is that which is inherent in substances, attributes, and actions, and is indispensable for them to produce sometimes co-operatively their own common effect or sometimes independently their own particular effects.\n\nSection 9.\u2014Non-potentiality\n\nWhat is the category non-potentiality? The category non-potentiality is that which is inherent in substances, attributes, and actions, and is indispensable for them in order to produce neither co-operatively another effect nor independently other effects than their own.\n\nSection 10.\u2014Commonness\n\nWhat is the category commonness? The category commonness is that which is substance-ness, attribute-ness, and action-ness, and (also) earth-ness, colour-ness, and throwing-upwards-ness, etc., which are inherent in one thing contained in each of the three categories.\n\nSubstance-ness is that which is inherent in every substance, the cause of the notion with respect to every\nsubstance that it is a substance, exists neither in attributes nor in actions, and is perceived by both the eyes and the touch-organ.\n\nAttribute-ness is that which is inherent in every attribute, the cause of the notion with respect to every attribute that it is an attribute, exists neither in substances nor in actions, and is perceived by all the sense-organs.\n\nAction-ness is that which is inherent in every action, the cause of the notion with respect to every action that it is an action, exists neither in substances nor in attributes, and is perceived by both the eyes and the touch-organ.\n\nEarth-ness and so on are defined in like manner.\n\nSection 11.\u2014Non-existence\n\nWhat is the category non-existence? Five non-existences are called the category non-existence.\n\nWhat are the five non-existences? (1) Antecedent non-existence, (2) subsequent non-existence, (3) reciprocal non-existence, (4) natural non-existence, and (5) absolute non-existence\u2014these are called the five non-existences.\n\nAntecedent non-existence is that in which the cause and accessories for substances, attributes, or actions do not yet combine, and no effect is produced.\n\nSubsequent non-existence is that in which the produced substances, attributes, or actions have been destroyed after the force of their causes had been exhausted or the accessories for their overthrow had been produced.\n\nReciprocal non-existence is that whereby some substances, etc., are not mutually present in others.\n\nNatural non-existence is that whereby existence, substances, and so on do not yet come either to conjoin with or entirely to abide in one another.\n\nAbsolute non-existence is that whereby a thing cannot be produced and be absolutely arisen in the present, the past, and the future, because there is no cause for it.\nChapter II\n\nCommon Properties of the Ten Categories\n\nSection 1.\u2014Substance\n\n1. Substances Active and Inactive, etc.\n\nWhich of these nine substances are active; which are inactive?\n\nThe five substances, earth, water, fire, wind, and mind, are active, while the other four are altogether inactive.\n\nThat they are corporeal or are incorporeal, have impetus or have no impetus, possess priority and posteriority, or possess neither priority nor posteriority, is explained as in the case of being active and inactive.\n\n2.

Substances possessing Touch, etc.\n\nWhich of these nine substances possess touch; which do not possess it?\n\nThe four substances, earth, water, fire, and wind, possess touch, but the other five do not possess it.\n\nThat they are both productive substances and causes of substances, attributes, and actions, or are only causes of either substances, or attributes, or actions (but are not productive substances), is explained in like manner.\n4. Substances possessing Colour, etc.\n\nWhich of these nine substances possess colour; which do not possess it?\n\nThe three substances, earth, water, and fire, possess colour, while the other six do not possess it.\n\nThat they are visible or are invisible, and are objects of sight or are not objects of sight, is explained in like manner.\n\n5. Substances Eternal and Non-eternal, etc.\n\nOf these nine substances five substances (ether, time, space, self, and mind) are eternal. The other four will be discriminated as follows:\n\nAmong these four substances the non-products are eternal, while the products are not eternal.\n\nThat they do not inhere in another substance or do inhere in another, do not consist of parts or do consist of parts, are not destroyed by their causes or are sometimes destroyed by them, are ultimate particulars or are not ultimate particulars, and are spherical or are not spherical, is explained as in the case of being eternal and non-eternal.\n\n6. Substances and Sense-organs\n\nOf these nine substances five are (material causes of) the sense-organs, and the other four are not (material causes of) the sense-organs.\n\nWhat are the five? They are earth, water, fire, wind, and ether.\n\nThe sense-organ of smell consists of earth, that of taste consists of water, that of sight consists of fire, that of touch consists of wind, and that of hearing consists of ether.\n\n7. Substances and Attributes\n\nAmong the nine substances by reason of how many attributes is earth called the possessor of attributes? It is by reason of fourteen attributes.\nWhat are the fourteen attributes? They are (1) colour, (2) taste, (3) smell, (4) touch, (5) number, (6) extension, (7) individuality, (8) conjunction, (9) disjunction, (10) priority, (11) posteriority, (12) gravity, (13) fluidity, and (14) impression.\n\nBy reason of how many attributes is water called the possessor of attributes?

It is by reason of eight attributes.\n\nWhat are the eight attributes? They are (1) number, (2) extension, (3) individuality, (4) conjunction, (5) disjunction, (6) priority, (7) posteriority, and (8) impression.\n\nSection 2.\u2014Attribute\n\n1. Attributes Perceptible and Imperceptible\n\nWhich of these twenty-four attributes are perceptible; which are imperceptible?\n\nColour, taste, smell, and touch are either perceptible or imperceptible.\n\nIn what conditions are they perceptible? They are perceptible when they abide in large substances and more than one substance.\n\nIn what conditions are they imperceptible? They are imperceptible when they abide in atoms and binary atomic compounds.\n\nSound is altogether perceptible.\n\nNumber, extension, individuality, conjunction, disjunction, priority, posteriority, fluidity, viscidity, and impetus are discriminated as in the case of colour, taste, smell, and touch.\n\nCognition, pleasure, pain, desire, aversion, and effort are perceptible to self.\nMerit, demerit, impression (and gravity) are only imperceptible.\n\n2. Attributes as Products and Non-products\n\nWhich of these attributes are products; which are non-products?\n\nCognition, pleasure, pain, desire, aversion, effort, merit, demerit, impression, disjunction, priority, posteriority, and sound are only products.\n\nThe other attributes are either products or non-products.\n\nColour, taste, smell, and touch are, if they are possessed by earth, altogether products.\n\nColour, taste, touch, fluidity, and viscidity, when inherent in (aqueous) atoms, are non-products, and the same attributes, when inherent in binary atomic compounds, are products.\n\nGravity is explained in like manner.\n\nColour and touch abiding in fire, and touch abiding in wind, are explained like the attributes of water.\n\nFluidity abiding in both earth and fire is altogether a product.\n\nNumber one (=unity) and single individuality are either products or non-products, according as they abide in produced substances or non-produced substances, and numbers from duality upwards and dual individualities, etc., are altogether products.\n\nLargeness, smallness, shortness, and length are altogether products, but sphericity is always non-product.\n\nConjunctions of corporeal substances with another corporeal, and those of corporeal substances with another incorporeal substance, are products.\n\n3. Attributes Eternal and Non-eternal\n\nEternality and non-eternity of attributes are explained as in the case of products and non-products.\n4. Varying Perceptibility of Attributes\n\nOf these attributes sound, touch, colour, taste, and smell are severally perceived by one sense-organ, number, extension, individuality, conjunction, disjunction, priority, posteriority, fluidity, viscidity, and impetus are perceived by the sight- and the touch-organ.\n\n5. Causes of Attributes\n\nWhat have these attributes as their causes? (1) Colour, taste, smell, and touch, which have things of the same class as their causes (are those which) are inherent in binary atomic compounds (etc.). (2)\n\nThose which have conjunction with fire as their cause are the colour, the taste, the smell, and the touch in the atoms belonging to earth, and the fluidity possessed by both earth and fire. (3)\n\nThe gravity possessed by both earth and water, and the fluidity and the viscidity possessed by water\u2014these (three), when inherent in binary atomic compounds, etc., have things of the same class as their causes. (4)\n\nNumber one (=unity) and single individuality, when inherent in binary atomic compounds, etc., have things of the same class as their causes. The numbers from duality upwards and the individualities in dual individualities have things of both the same class and different classes as their causes. Single individuality has its notion as its cause. (5)\n\nLargeness and length are caused by plurality and have each a kind of aggregation (of atoms) as their cause. Smallness and shortness have (one substance produced by) two (atoms) as their cause. (6)\n\nConjunction and disjunction have the action of one of the two conjunct things and of the disjunct things, the actions of both, conjunction and disjunction as their causes. (7)\nPriority and posteriority have each as their causes (a substance which) occupies the same time, etc., and (upon which) depend the notion of remoteness and nearness. (8)\n\nCognition is twofold, perception and inference. (9)\n\nPerception is fourfold, (1) doubtful perception, (2) decisive perception, (3) imperfect perception, and (4) perfect perception. (10)\n\nWhat is the cause of doubtful perception? Doubtful perception is that which is preceded by the perception of properties common to more than one object, has its cause in contact of self with mind caused by the recollection of specific properties of the alternatives, and is the knowledge in deliberation, as \"which is this?\" (11)\n\nWhat is the cause of decisive perception? Decisive perception is that which is preceded by doubtful perception, has its cause in contact of self with mind caused by the ascertainment of the specific property of one of the alternatives, and is the knowledge in assertion, as \"it is this.\" (12)\n\nWhat is the cause of imperfect perception? Imperfect perception is that which is preceded by the perception of properties common to more than one object, has its cause in contact of self with mind caused by taking improperly the specific property of one of the alternatives for that of the other, and is the knowledge in incorrect assertion. (13)\n\nWhat is the cause of perfect perception? Perfect perception is that which is preceded by the perception of properties common to more than one object, has its cause in contact of self with mind caused by the perception of the specific property of one of the alternatives, and is knowledge without error. (14)\n\nInference is also classified and explained, as in the case of perception. (15)\n\nPerception is produced in three ways, (1) perception\nproduced by contact of four (factors), (2) perception produced by contact of three (factors), and (3) perception produced by contact of two (factors). (16)\n\nWhat is the perception produced by contact of four (factors)? It is the sensory representation. All the perceptions of colour, taste, smell, touch, number, extension, individuality, conjunction, disjunction, priority, posteriority, fluidity, viscidity, impetus, which are altogether appreciable (by residing in more than one and coloured substances), and of the actions throwing upwards, etc., abiding in the substances, earth, water, and fire, and of existence, commonness, potentiality, and non-potentiality, with the exception of the potentiality, non-potentiality, and sound-ness which are inherent in sound, have their causes in contact of four (factors), self, sense-organs, mind, and objects. (17)\n\nWhat is the perception produced by contact of three (factors)? All the perceptions of sound and of objects like potentiality, non-potentiality, sound-ness, and existence which are inherent in sound have their causes in contact of three (factors), self, sense-organ, and mind. (18)\n\nWhat is the perception produced by contact of two (factors)? All the cognitions of the objects like pleasure, pain, desire, aversion, and effort, and of the objects like potentiality, non-potentiality, commonness, and existence which are inherent in these (five) attributes, have their causes in contact of two (factors), self and mind. (19)\n\nInference is that which is preceded by the knowledge of one of two things inherent in the same substance, and of a thing contradictory to the other, and has its cause in contact of self with mind, taking place in consequence of the recollection of the connections between them. (20)\n\nPleasure and pain have their causes in contact of the four (factors), the three, and the two, caused by merit and demerit. (21)\n\nDesire and aversion have their causes in contact of\nself with mind caused by pleasure, pain, reminiscence, and imperfect perception. (22)\n\nEffort has its cause in contact of self with mind caused by desire and aversion, in the instinct to live, because there is as yet no desire, and in actions like breathing in and out, etc. (23)\n\nWhat is the cause of impetus? Its cause is the impetus of the actions arising from impulsion. (24)\n\nMerit and demerit are preceded by desire and aversion, and have their causes in contact of self with mind, caused by hearing and reflecting on, or by disregarding the fact that merit and demerit (severally) bring about a pure or impure state in the future life. (25)\n\nImpression, i.e. the cause of reminiscence, has its cause in contact of self with mind caused by the impression of perceptive and inferential knowledge. (26)\n\nSound has a threefold origin, as (1) sound originated by conjunction, (2) sound originated by disjunction, and (3) sound originated by sound. (27)\n\nSound originated by conjunction has its cause in the conjunction of substances possessing touch, in (a region of) ether accompanied by impetus, which causes the conjunction of the substances. (28)\n\nSound originated by disjunction has its cause in the disjunction of substances possessing touch, in (a region of) ether accompanied by impetus, which causes the disjunction of the substances. (29)\n\nSound originated by sound has its cause in the sound in an empty region accompanied by impetus causing the conjunction and disjunction of substances possessing touch. (30)\n\n6. Attributes abiding in one Substance, etc.\n\nWhich of these twenty-four attributes have one substance as their substratum? Which have more than one substance as their substratum?\nColour, taste, smell, touch, extension, priority, posteriority, cognition, pleasure, pain, desire, aversion, effort, merit, demerit, impression, gravity, fluidity, viscidity, impetus, and sound\u2014these twenty-one attributes have one substance as their substratum.\n\nConjunction and disjunction have two substances as their substratum.\n\nNumbers have either one substance or more than one substance as their substratum.\n\nWhich has one substance as its substratum? It is number one (= unity).\n\nWhich have more than one substance as their substratum? They are the numbers from duality upwards.\n\nAs for individuality, it is explained as in the case of number.\n\n7. Attributes pervading, or not, their Substrata\n\nWhich of these twenty-four attributes pervade their substrata; which do not pervade them?\n\nColour, taste, smell, touch, number, extension, individuality, priority, posteriority, fluidity, viscidity, gravity, and impetus pervade their substrata.\n\nThe other attributes do not pervade their substrata.\n\n8. Attributes destroyed by their Effects, etc.\n\nWhich of these twenty-four attributes are destroyed by their effects, by their causes, or by both? (1)\n\nSounds originated by conjunction and disjunction and all sounds which originate other sounds are destroyed by their (respective) effects. (2)\n\nMerit is destroyed by its effects, i.e. pleasure and perfect cognition. (3)\n\nDemerit is destroyed by its effects, i.e. pain and imperfect cognition. (4)\n\nAll cognitions are destroyed by their (respective) effects, i.e. impressions. (5)\nEach special cognition is destroyed by its effects, i.e. the impression of all other cognitions. (6)\n\nThe last produced sound is destroyed by all its causes. (7)\n\nThe last produced attributes of self are also destroyed by their causes. (8)\n\nPleasure and pain are destroyed by their (respective) effects, i.e. desire and aversion. (9)\n\nMerit and demerit are destroyed by their (respective) causes. (10)\n\nDesire and aversion are destroyed by their effect, i.e. effort. (11)\n\nPleasure and pain are destroyed by their (respective) causes. (12)\n\nIntermediately produced sounds are explained as above (i.e. are destroyed by their causes and effects). (13)\n\nEffort and pain, which are the attributes of self, are, when they conjoin with the substances possessing touch, not in the relation of destroyer and destroyed, as effect or as cause. (14)\n\nImpression, i.e. the cause of reminiscence, which is an attribute of self, and pain are not in the relation of destroyer and destroyed as cause or as effect. (15)\n\nImpression, i.e. the cause of reminiscence, is destroyed by its effects. (16)\n\nImpression, i.e. the cause of actions, when it conjoins with substances possessing touch, is not destroyed by its effects. (17)\n\nThe numbers from duality upwards are not opposed to their effects, i.e. the notions of duality, etc. (18)\n\nIndividualities in dual individualities, etc., priority, and posteriority are explained as in the case of the numbers, duality, etc. (19)\n\nColour, taste, smell, and touch inherent in atoms belonging to earth, and the conjunction of these (four attributes) with fire, are not in the relation of destroyer and destroyed as effects or as cause. (20)\nConjunction and disjunction are not mutually (in the relation of) cause and effect, but they are opposed to each other. (21)\n\nThe colour, etc., in the atoms of a substance, which produce the colour, etc., of binary atomic compounds of the same class, are not destroyed by their effects, because they are effects of the same class. (22)\n\nThe last produced effects, i.e. the colour, etc., of substances consisting of parts, are not destroyed by their causes, i.e. colour, etc., because they are of the same class. (23)\n\nAll the \"intermediately produced colour, etc., of substances consisting of parts are not destroyed by their effects and causes of the same class, i.e. colour, etc. (24)\n\nColour, etc., in a substance are commonly not (in the relation of) effect and cause, and are not opposed to one another. (25)\n\nEvery attribute is not opposed to its substance. (26)\n\n9. Attributes inhering in Substances, etc.\n\nWhich of these twenty-four attributes inhere in substances; which do not inhere in substances?\n\nEvery attribute inheres in substance.\n\nThat they are altogether without attributes, are inactive, are non-inherent causes, are the signs of the substances possessing the attributes, are incorporeal, and do not consist of parts, is explained in like manner.\n\nSection 3.\u2014Action\n\n1. Actions inhering in Substances, etc.\n\nWhich of these five actions inhere in substances; which do not inhere in them?\n\nAll inhere in substances.\n\nThat they have each one substance as their substratum, are incorporeal, are without attributes, do not consist of parts, are the (absolute) causes of disjunction and conjunction, are productive and products, are non-aggregates,\nare the signs of substance, are causes of impression produced by impulsions, etc., and have causes of different classes, is explained in like manner.\n\n2. Actions having Substances as their Substrata\n\nWhich substances have these five actions respectively as being their substrata?\n\nThe action throwing upwards has its substrata in all of earth, water, fire, wind, and in mind.\n\nThe actions throwing downwards and going are explained as in the case of the action throwing upwards.\n\nThe action contracting has its substrata in large and long substances, which are effects of a particular arrangement of very loosely connected parts.\n\nThe action expanding is explained as in the case of the action contracting.\n\n3. Actions pervading their Substrata\n\nWhich of these five actions pervade their substrata; which do not pervade them?\n\nAll these actions pervade their substrata.\n\nSome say that actions abiding in atoms and mind pervade their substrata, while those abiding in binary atomic compounds, etc., do not pervade their substrata.\n\n4. Actions in Body, etc.\n\nOf these five the actions existing inside (of a body) have as their inherent cause the body and its organs, i.e., the four sense-organs of smell, taste, touch, and sight, and mind. (1)\n\nThe first action in the body is preceded by desire, and has conjunction with, and effort of, self as its non-inherent causes. (2)\n\nThe second action and so forth have (in order) the impression (of their last action) as their non-inherent cause. (3)\nActions residing in mind and in the parts (of the body) are explained like the actions in the body. (4)\n\nThe first actions in the nose, the tongue, the skin, and the eyes have conjunction with self and that of effort (of self) with the body as their non-inherent causes. (5)\n\nThe second action and so forth have (in order) the impression (of their last action) as their non-inherent cause. (6)\n\nThe actions in pestles and staffs, etc., and in a garland, a necklace, and perfume, etc., which belong to the body, are explained like the actions in the nose, etc. (7)\n\nThe first action of the falling down of a sleeper\u2019s body has gravity as its non-inherent cause. (8)\n\nThe second action and so forth have (in order) gravity and the impression (of their last action) as their non-inherent causes. (9)\n\nThe actions of breathing in and out, or the first action, of sleepers are, because there is as yet no desire, preceded by the instinct to live, and have their non-inherent cause in conjunction of effort with self. (10)\n\nThe second action and so forth have (in order) the impression (of their last action) as their non-inherent cause. (11)\n\nThe first action of the running down of water has fluidity as its non-inherent cause. (12)\n\nThe second action and so on have (in order) fluidity and the impression (of their last action) as their non-inherent causes. (13)\n\nThe first actions of the upward flaming of fire and of the sideward blowing of wind have conjunction of merit and demerit with self as their non-inherent cause. (14)\n\nThe second action and so forth are as above explained. (15)\n\nThe first action of the causes producing bodies from atoms of the four elements has conjunction of merit and demerit with self as its non-inherent cause. (16)\n\nThe second action and so on are as explained above. (17)\nActions causing change in trees, etc., and those residing in binary atomic compounds, etc., are as explained in the case of actions producing bodies. (18)\n\nThe first action of the inclination and repugnance in mind has conjunction of merit and demerit with self as its non-inherent cause. (19)\n\nThe second action and so forth are as explained above. (20)\n\nThe first action of the actions in the (present) world, which represent the ripening of the happy and the unhappy effects of creatures, has conjunction of merit and demerit with self as its non-inherent cause. (21)\n\nThe second action and so on are as explained above. (22)\n\nThe actions in earth, water, and fire resulting from impulsion, impact, and (conjunction with) the conjunct have conjunction, gravity, fluidity, effort, and impetus as their non-inherent causes. (23)\n\nThese can be any of the actions throwing upwards and so on according to the circumstances (or their substrata). If they are in fire, gravity is omitted; if in wind, fluidity is omitted; and if in mind, impulsion and impact are omitted. (24)\n\nSection 4.\u2014Existence\n\nIs the before-mentioned existence a product or non-product?\n\nExistence is certainly non-product.\n\nThat it is eternal, is without attributes in itself, is inactive, and does not consist of parts, is explained as above.\n\nExistence possesses (i.e. exists in) substances, attributes, and actions; it is something inherent in these (three) categories, with the exception of universality, potentiality, non-potentiality, commonness, and particularity, and is one; it is the cause of the general notion (with respect to the first three categories) that they are existent and an independent entity.\nSection 5.\u2014Particularity\n\nParticularity exists in substances, has one substance as its substratum, is the cause of the intellection of excluding others and determining the one, exists in ether, space, and time, is the cause of the notion with respect to ether, etc. (that that is ether, space, or time), and is eternal, non-product, is without attributes and inactive, does not consist of parts, is something inherent in the category (substance), with the exception of existence, potentiality, non-potentiality, commonness, and particularity, and is more than one.\n\nSection 6.\u2014Inherence\n\nInherence is only one, eternal, and non-product; it does not consist of parts; it is incorporeal, and the cause of being inherent of all substances, attributes, actions, universality, particularities, potentiality, non-potentiality, and commonness; it has for mark the recognition (of its existence).\n\nSections 7\u20138.\u2014Potentiality and Non-potentiality\n\nIs the before-mentioned potentiality a product or non-product?\n\nPotentiality is certainly non-product.\n\nThat it is eternal, without attributes, inactive, does not consist of parts, and is incorporeal, is explained in like manner.\n\nPotentiality is different according as it resides in substances, attributes, or actions; it is something inherent in the categories, with the exception of universality, potentiality, non-potentiality, commonness, and particularity; it is more than one, and is also the cause of the notions (with respect to the categories that they are potential).\n\nNon-potentiality is explained by the analogy of potentiality.\nSection 9.\u2014Commonness\n\nCommonness as substance-ness pervades the category substance; it is something inherent in substances, it is one and incorporeal, it does not consist of parts, it is inactive, without attributes, eternal, and non-product; it inheres commonly in all the substances, but it is different from the commonnesses in attributes and actions.\n\nCommonness as attribute-ness, as action-ness, or as earth-ness is explained as in the case of commonness as substance-ness.\n\nSection 10.\u2014Non-existence\n\n1. Non-existences Eternal and Non-eternal\n\nWhich of these five non-existences are eternal; which are non-eternal?\n\nAntecedent non-existence is non-eternal, because it is opposed to the products of substances, attributes, and actions.\n\nSubsequent non-existence, reciprocal non-existence, and absolute non-existence are altogether eternal, because they are not destroyed by substances, etc.\n\nNatural non-existence is either eternal or non-eternal.\n\nIn what case is natural non-existence eternal?\n\nThe substances earth, etc., are not in the inherence relation to other attributes (than their own).\n\nUniversality - particularity (i.e. commonness), like substance-ness, etc., potentiality, non-potentiality, and particularity, does not inhere in substrata other than its own (respective).\n\nExistence does not inhere in universality, etc.\n\nIn what case is natural non-existence non-eternal?\n\nThere is the case where a substance does not conjoin with other substances, but will certainly conjoin with them afterwards. (Before the conjunction takes place) the former does not exist in the latter.\nOr before a substance comes to conjoin with another substance and makes the attributes and actions thereof inherent in itself, the latter do not exist in the former.\n\n2. Non-existences Perceptible and Imperceptible\n\nWhich of these five non-existences are objects of perception; which are not objects of it?\n\nAll the five non-existences are not objects of perception.\n\nOn the other hand, even those which exist without being supported by other things are altogether objects of inference.\n\nSection 11.\u2014Conclusion\n\nWhich of these ten categories are knowable; which are not knowable?\n\nAll are knowable and also causes of their recognitions.\nDASAPADARTH'I\n\nNOTES\n\nChapter I (pp. 93\u2013101)\n\nSection 1.\u2014Ten Categories (p. 93)\n\nThe term *pad\u0101rtha* (category) has been etymologically rendered into Chinese. The translation is literally \"the meaning or object of a word.\" Kwh\u0113i-ci explains, *pada* means a footprint. Just as a man seeks an elephant by tracing his footsteps, we understand the meaning by *pada*, because *pada* is the footprint of the meaning. \"Word\" was used by earlier translators as the translation of *pada*, and accepted by the present translator (Yuan Chwang).\n\nIn V.S. the term *pada* is not met with, and the exact meaning of *pad\u0101rtha* is not explained. *Artha* (object), in V.S. has not an abstract meaning, but it is the designation of substances, attributes, and actions. It means, therefore, a thing which exists as an entity in the objective and the subjective world. And *pada* corresponds to \u015babda in V.S. But \u015babda in V.S. has three meanings, sound and voice, word, and concept. Word and concept are treated as the same, and letters which represent them are also considered as the same. Every concept has a corresponding object, because the origin of a concept is in the object. But the concept and the object are entirely independent of each other, so that there is no connection between them. That the existence of the object can be inferred from the concept is, therefore, conventional (*s\u0101mayika*), though it is always valid.\n\n---\n\n1 Cf. Max M\u00fcller, \"Bedeutung, Ziel oder Gegenstand (*artha*) eines Wortes (*pada*)\" : ZDMG, vi (1852), p. 11.\n2 Cf. Tarka-dipik\u0101, p. 2, Athalye's notes, p. 73; N.S., 2, 2, 60.\n3 8, 2, 3.\n4 8, 1, 25-27; 2, 2, 21-37; 7, 2, 14-20.\n5 See N.S. 2, 1, 5, 5 (na; *s\u0101mayik\u0101c chabda-artha-sampratyayasya*).\nThis doctrine results from the fundamental characteristic of the system. The system is a realism, or rather a naive realism in the epistemological and the metaphysical sense of the term. For the system the objective and the subjective world have equally a real existence. This cannot admit of doubt, and the idealistic critics of the objective world or subjective cognition are, not at all known to the author of V.S. As a matter of fact, the existence of the concept of an object, subjective as well as objective, is the logical reason for and the real consequence of the existence of the object. The meaning of the term *pad\u0101rtha* is understood from this standpoint.\n\nThe six categories, as corresponding to the concepts, have each their reality; but the classification into six has its ground in our concepts. That is to say, the distinctions in our concepts have been extended or projected into the objects.\n\nThe starting-point of the system is the observation of objects, and an object is analysed principally into three categories. An object itself is called substance (*dravya*); its quality, quantity, and so on are called attributes (*guna*), and its activity is actions (*karman*). Substance is thus defined, \"the definition of substance is that it is possessed of actions and attributes, and is an inherent cause\";\u00b9 attribute thus, \"that it has substance as a substratum, is without attributes and is not a cause of conjunctions and disjunctions being unconnected with them, is the definition of attribute\";\u00b2 and action thus, \"that it abides in one substance, is without attributes, and is the absolute cause of conjunctions and disjunctions, is the definition of action.\"\u00b3 Substances may be defined\n\n\u00b9 Gough's translation, a little modified. *V.S.* 1, 1, 15, \"Kriy\u0101-guna-vat san\u0101v\u0101yi-k\u0101ra\u1e47am iti dravya-lak\u1e63a\u1e47am.\"\n\n\u00b2 *V.S.* 1, 1, 16, \"Dravya-\u0101\u015brayya guna-v\u0101n s\u0101myoga-vibh\u0101ge\u015bv-ak\u0101ra\u1e47am anapek\u1e63a iti guna-lak\u1e63a\u1e47am.\"\n\n\u00b3 *V.S.* 1, 1, 17, \"Eka-dravyam guna\u1e41 s\u0101myoga-vibh\u0101ge\u015bv-anapek\u1e63a-k\u0101ra\u1e47am iti karma-lak\u1e63a\u1e47am.\"\nsimply as entities which possess attributes and actions. Attributes and actions, as such, are the forms of appearance, and the modes of activity, of the substances. Consequently they have no attributes and no activity in themselves.\n\nAs existing in an object, these three categories must have an inseparable relation, however independent of one another, because the analysis into the three categories depends upon the observation, or the concept, of the concrete object, and consequently the three categories are always in unity. The relation is called inherence (samav\u0101ya), which is also an entity.\n\nOn the other hand, the concrete object has relations to other objects of the same class and its whole class at the same time. Accordingly the object can be a genus and a species (and an individual). In this relation universality (s\u0101m\u0101nya) and particularity (vi\u015be\u1e63a) (and the ultimate particulars, or the final species, antya-vi\u015be\u1e63a) are established. These two categories are likewise independent categories.\n\nThe latter three categories are secondary, as later writers call them, including the seventh category, non-existence, up\u0101dhi, and evidently show that the six categories are established for the explanation of an object, and that the establishment of them is founded on the concepts.\n\nThe six categories are enumerated in V.S. and Pr. Bh. But our treatise widely differs from them in this respect, and acknowledges ten categories, that is, potentiality (\u015bakti), non-potentiality (a\u015bakti), commonness (s\u0101m\u0101nya-vi\u015be\u1e63a), and non-existence (abh\u0101va) added to the six.\n\nIn the Ny\u0101ya-kandal\u012b, a commentary on Pr. Bh., \u015aridhara rejects \u015bakti, s\u0101dr\u015bya (resemblance or similarity), and abh\u0101va as categories, while Udayana, commenting on Pr. Bh., accepts abh\u0101va as a seventh\n\n1 pp. 7, 15, 144, 145.\ncategory, and rejects \u015bakti, sa\u1e45khy\u0101 (number), and s\u0101dr\u015bya as categories.\\(^1\\) Also \u015aiv\u0101ditya in his Suptapad\u0101rth\u012b acknowledges abh\u0101va and rejects \u015bakti and s\u0101dr\u015bya, etc.\\(^2\\) Our treatise appears not to have been known to these authors; they oppose some M\u012bm\u0101\u1e41sakas.\n\nThe M\u012bm\u0101\u1e41s\u0101 and the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika, as stated above, have a close relation to, and have been influenced by, each other. There were at least four commentaries on M.S. before the time of \u015aabara-sv\u0101min, who seems to have lived in the fourth century. The commentaries are by Bhartr-mitra, by Bhava-d\u0101sa, by Hari, and by Upavarsa.\\(^3\\) After \u015aabara-sv\u0101min, Kum\u0101rila Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da and Prabh\u0101-kara were the two most eminent M\u012bm\u0101\u1e41sakas, and the Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da and the Guru schools were founded by them. Still, neither of them were the first pioneers in their theories, and they are certainly later than the author of our treatise, because Kum\u0101rila Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da lived after, or was a contemporary of, Dharma-k\u012brti, and Prabh\u0101-kara was once a disciple of Kum\u0101rila Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da. Kum\u0101rila Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da may be regarded as a reformer of the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e41s\u0101 in some points, while Prabh\u0101-kara is not a reformer, as usually supposed, but follows the opinions of a certain V\u1e5btti-k\u0101ra, who is not Kum\u0101rila Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da, and of \u015aabara-sv\u0101min.\\(^4\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Kiran\u0101val\u012b, p. 6, and his Lak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101val\u012b, pp. 1, 2, 13.\n\n\\(^2\\) Suptapad\u0101rth\u012b, p. 10.

Winter's remarks on it (ZDMG. liii, pp. 323 f.). \u015aiv\u0101ditya lived before Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba-up\u0101dhy\u0101ya, a famous logician, because the latter quotes a few lines from the work.\n\n\\(^3\\) Ga\u1e45g\u0101-n\u0101tha Jh\u0101, *The Prabh\u0101kara School of P\u016brva M\u012bm\u0101\u1e41s\u0101* (Allahabad, 1911), pp. 6, 7. In this work it is stated that \u015aabara-sv\u0101min lived 57 B.C., and was the father of king Vikram\u0101ditya, Var\u0101ha-mitra, and Bhartr-hari, according to the tradition held by Pa\u1e47\u1e0dits. The date 57 B.C. is impossible, because \u015aabara-sv\u0101min refutes the \u015a\u016bnya-v\u0101da and the Vij\u00f1\u0101na-v\u0101da in his Bh\u0101sya (pp. 8, 9). (Cf. G. Jh\u0101's Introduction to the translation of the \u015aloka-v\u1e5bttiika, Bibl. Ind.) But, if he had been a senior contemporary of the three noted men, he must have lived about the fourth century.

Jacobi's *The Dates of the S\u016btras*, quoted in the Introduction.\n\n\\(^4\\) Prabh\u0101kara School, pp. 10\u201313.\nKum\u0101rila Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da mentions \u015bakti, s\u0101d\u1e5b\u015bya, and abh\u0101va, not as categories, but as the principles of pram\u0101\u1e47a,\\(^1\\) i.e. \u015bakti for pram\u0101\u1e47a in general, s\u0101d\u1e5b\u015bya for upam\u0101\u1e47a (analogy), and abh\u0101va for abh\u0101va (privation, or negation), while in the Pr\u0101bh\u0101kara view \u015bakti and s\u0101d\u1e5b\u015bya are two categories beside the others.\\(^2\\) Consequently it may be inferred that among some earlier M\u012bm\u0101\u1e41sakas \u015bakti and s\u0101d\u1e5b\u015bya were recognized as categories.\n\nThe time when these two categories were acknowledged as such is not ascertained, but it may have been, at the latest, about the sixth-seventh century, because one V\u1e5btti-k\u0101ra, being looked upon by the Pr\u0101bh\u0101kara school as its predecessor, must have been earlier than Kum\u0101rila Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da, and Pra\u015basta-p\u0101da seems not to have known such categories. If so, the time is about the same as that of our treatise. In those days the doctrines of the six categories were changed by both the Vai\u015be\u1e63ikas and the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e41sakas.\n\nNevertheless, the author of the treatise appears not to have been influenced by the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e41sakas, since he does not acknowledge s\u0101d\u1e5b\u015bya as a category, though \u015bakti is reckoned as a category. \u015aakti as a category is, in the treatise, derived from V.S., and has no trace of the influence of the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e41sakas, as stated in the following notes.\\(^3\\)\n\nAs for abh\u0101va, Prabh\u0101-kara, differing from \u015aabarasv\u0101min, did not accept it even as a pram\u0101\u1e47a.\\(^4\\) But abh\u0101va (asat) is stated in V.S. as a principle of pram\u0101\u1e47a, not as a category.

But if abh\u0101va is established as a negative category contrary to the positive categories, substance, attribute, action, and existence, a\u015bakti may analogically be recognized as a negative complement to \u015bakti.\n\nAs for commonness (s\u0101m\u0101nya-vi\u015be\u1e63a) it has been discussed in the Introduction (pp. 66\u201372).\n\nThe author of the treatise, urged by the thoughts of the time, and following the historical development, established the four categories and well adapted them to the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika theories.\u00b9\n\nSection 2.\u2014Substance (pp. 93\u20134)\n\nEarth, Water, Fire, and Wind (p. 93)\n\nThe definitions of the four substances exactly correspond to V.S. 2, 1, 1\u20134. The s\u016btras, 2, 1, 1\u20134, do not describe the substances as atoms, but they mention them as effects, or aggregates. Atoms are discussed in V.S. 2, 1, 8\u20139;\n\n\u00b9 The Vai\u015be\u1e63ika in \u015aa\u1e45kara's Brahma-s\u016btra-bh\u0101\u1e63ya on 2, 2, 17, exhibits the six categories, and Hari-bhadra, a Jain (the ninth century, ZDMG. xl, p. 103), also mentions the six categories in his Loka-tattva-nir\u1e47aya (Giorn. d. Soc. Asia, italiana, 1905, p. 279). It seems that the system still in the seventh\u2013ninth centuries held to the six categories. But \u015aiv\u0101ditya and Udayana accepted the seventh category, and the Pram\u0101\u1e47a-ma\u1e6d\u1e6djari by Sarva-deva (T\u0101rka-cakra-c\u016b\u1e0d\u0101ma\u1e47i) holds the seven categories. A manuscript of the work is dated in the eleventh century (Bendall's Catalogue of Sanskrit MSS. in the British Museum, p. 138, No. 335; Catalogue of Sanskrit MSS. in the India Office, p. 666, No. 2075, B\u00fchler's Reports, Kashmir, p. xxvi). The seventh category appears to have been acknowledged by the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika in the tenth century, and the treatise did not influence later Vai\u015be\u1e63ika works. But even after the tenth century the Tarka-bh\u0101\u1e63\u0101 (the thirteenth\u2013fourteenth century), the Pad\u0101rtha-kha\u1e47\u1e0dana by \u015airo-ma\u1e47i (the sixteenth century), etc., represent the six categories (Catalogue of Sanskrit MSS. of the India Office, p. 670, Nos. 2093\u20137, No. 2128).\n4, 1, 1\u20135; 4, 2, 4; 5, 2, 13; 7, 1, 18\u201321; and 2, 2, 1\u20135; 7, 1, 2\u201314; 1, 2, 1\u20132. The atomic theory in these s\u016btras may be summarized as follows:\n\nThe proof of the existence of atoms depends upon reasoning from effects to causes, and it is from substances as effects to the same as causes, from attributes to their substrata, and from imperfect cognition to perfect cognition.\n\nSubstances as effects (k\u0101rya-dravya)\\(^1\\) are always transitory; but according to the general idea of the system the transitoriness of substances must presuppose their eternity, and the concept of transitoriness depends upon that of eternity, just as imperfect cognition is possible by presupposing perfect cognition. Hence, at the base of transitory substances there are necessarily eternal substances, i.e. real and never produced entities.\n\nAnd more: attributes are, in their nature, possessed by substances. Some attributes reside in the same substance as effects, while others abide in many substances as effects. By comparing such substances with one another, the definite attribute is inductively known to be extrinsic, or to be intrinsic, to the definite substance. Such an intrinsic attribute must have its eternal substratum, because without an attribute as cause there cannot be any attributes as effects.\n\nAll misunderstanding and negation of eternal substances, being due to the existence and the real nature thereof, or misconceptions regarding the final base of the world, lead to the establishment of such substances.\\(^2\\)\n\nSuch eternal substances are of four sorts, i.e. earth, water, fire, and wind, and called \u0101\u1e47u (atom), not param\u0101\u1e47u as they are termed in Pr. Bh. and our treatise, and in later Vai\u015be\u1e63ika works.\\(^3\\) In N.S. 4, 2, 17\u201325, and later Vai\u015be\u1e63ika\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The term is taken from N.S. 4, 2, 20. V.S. does not use the term.\n\n\\(^2\\) Cf. 7, 2, 4\u20136, and notes on ch. i, 3, 5 (number) and 7 (individuality).\n\n\\(^3\\) Even in N.S. param\u0101\u1e47u is not used.\nworks,\u00b9 the existence of atoms is proved by analysis, that is, there must be a final limit or end of analysis, otherwise analysis is endless (anavasth\u0101, regressus ad infinitum), and everything must have the same quantity of atoms and consequently the same size. This mode of proof is not known to V.S.\n\nAmong the four atoms\u00b2 terrene atoms have smell, aqueous atoms have taste, igneous atoms have colour, and aerial atoms have touch as their natural attributes. And to aqueous atoms cold is also intrinsic, and to igneous atoms heat. All these attributes in atoms are eternal.\n\nThe four atoms are active and productive; but their first action is caused by ad\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da (unseen force, destiny). They are the bases of extension (parim\u0101\u1e47a), number (sa\u1e41khy\u0101), and individuality (prthaktva). The extension of them is called p\u0101rimandalya (sphericity), contrary to extended things. The meaning of p\u0101rimandalya may be understood by comparison with the geometrical point in the strict sense of the term. Consequently they are not non-extensive, but they have no perceptible extensions; they are single entities.\n\nThese atoms conjoin with other atoms and produce compound things as their effects. The theory of production in the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika is not production in the ordinary sense, but aggregation, or combination of materials. For convenience sake the term production will sometimes be used.\n\nThe process of the combination of atoms is not clearly stated in V.S. But the author of V.S. is probably of the following opinion. First, two atoms conjoin together and produce effects. Then the effects conjoin with another atom and produce effects and so on. Pr. Bh.: calls an\n\n\u00b9 Ny\u0101ya-kanda\u1e6d\u012b, p. 31; Upask\u0101ra, on 1, 2, 6; 4, 1, 2. The V\u1e5btti also uses this mode of proof.\n\u00b2 Cf. Pr. Bh. \u201cbh\u016bta- (i.e. prthivy\u0101din\u0101\u1e41 pa\u00f1c\u0101n\u0101\u1e41, K\u012bra\u1e47\u0101val\u012b, p. 37) -\u0101tman\u0101\u1e41 vai\u015be\u1e63ika-gunavattv\u0101\u1e41\u201d (p. 24); cf. notes on ch. ii, 1, 7.\neffect of two atoms dvyanuka (a binary atomic compound), and an effect of three atoms tryanuka (a ternary atomic compound), and so on. The Chinese translator of the treatise seems to have given a traditional explanation of the process to his disciple, Kwh\u0113i-ci. This is preserved in the commentaries of the latter. The following is an extract from Kwh\u0113i-ci's commentary on No. 1240:\n\n\"Earth, water, fire, and wind are the atoms. Even at the time of pralaya or sa\u1e41h\u0101ra (dissolution of the world) they never yield to complete destruction and exist here and there. They can neither be produced nor be destroyed; they have eternal reality. Atoms are plural in number, even among the atoms of the same class.\n\n\"At the time of sarga or s\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6di (creation of the world) two atoms conjoin together and bring about products. The products have each exactly the same quantity as the original two atoms (i.e., the production is nothing but the aggregation or combination of the two atoms; there is nothing newly created and added), but they have each one mass (because the two atoms make one) and are non-eternal, because they have been produced by the atoms. Every product which in this way has been made from the two separate atoms conjoins with another original (atom), and makes a ternary atom. These ternary atoms conjoin with other ternary atoms and produce products (which are called the seventh). The quantity of the seventh (product) is the same as that of the original six atoms. (Thus the seventh product conjoins with another atom and produces the\n\n---\n\n1 The commentary is on the Vij\u00f1apti-m\u0101trat\u0101-vi\u1e41\u015baka-s\u0101stra of Vasu-bandhu, and is preserved in the Dainishon-zoku-zokyo, 83, bk. ii, pp. 139b-173b. The extract is from pp. 154b-155a. Almost the same explanation is found in his commentaries on Nos. 1197, 1216.\n\n2 The original two atoms are called \"father-and mother-atom\", and the product is called \"son-atom\". The terms are apt to lead to misunderstanding of the process.\n\n3 Dharma-p\u0101la also mentions this characteristic, No. 1197, p. 3a; No. 1198, p. 49a.\nproduct consisting of seven atoms.) (The products consisting of) seven atoms conjoin with another (product consisting of seven atoms) and produce products, which are called fifteenth atomic products. The quantity of the fifteenth product is exactly the same as that of the original fourteen atoms. In this way the world is produced. The world, being produced from the original two atoms (and so forth), has the same quantity as all atoms.\"\u00b9\n\nAccording to the traditional explanation an atom first conjoins with another atom and produces a product, which is a binary atomic compound (dvya\u1e47uka), and is called the third product. The third product conjoins with another atom and produces a ternary atomic compound. And this ternary atomic compound conjoins with another ternary atomic compound, and produces a seventh product. And so on. Consequently a third product contains two atoms, a seventh contains six, and a fifteenth contains fourteen.\n\nAmong later Vai\u015be\u1e63ikas the process is differently explained. \u015ar\u012bdhara in his Ny\u0101ya-kandal\u012b explains that a ternary atomic compound (trya\u1e47uka) is the aggregate of three dvya\u1e47ukas (binary atomic compounds), and a quaternary atomic compound (caturanuka), etc., are also made of four dvya\u1e47ukas, etc.\u00b2 He gives the reason why the dvya\u1e47uka must be the direct component of a trya\u1e47uka and a caturanuka, etc. A single atom and three atoms have no productiveness, and even a dvya\u1e47uka must conjoin with another dvya\u1e47uka to produce any of the things\n\n\u00b9 The passage has been wrongly explained by later commentators. They understand the meaning as follows:\u2014Two atoms conjoin together and produce a product, which is called the third product. The third product conjoins with another third product (but never with another single atom) and produces the product which is called the seventh product. The seventh product conjoins with another seventh product (but never with another third or with another atom) and produces the product which is called the fifteenth product. Consequently the third product must consist of two atoms, the seventh of four, and the fifteenth of eight atoms.\n\n\u00b2 p. 32. The same explanation is found in Laug\u0101k\u1e63i Bh\u0101skara\u2019s Tarka-kaumud\u012b (Bombay, 1907), p. 3.\nin the world. Bh\u0101va-viveka, a contemporary of Dharmap\u0101la, sometimes does not give to single atoms the name substances (dravya), but two atoms and three atoms are so called.\\(^1\\) In his case it is not certain whether the three atoms are the aggregate of three dvya\u1e47ukas or of three single atoms; but the literal meaning of the Chinese translation evidently favours the latter alternative. That he did not call single atoms substances may be gathered from \u015ar\u012b-dhara\u2019s explanation. If it be so, \u015ar\u012b-dhara\u2019s theory may have originated at an earlier time. But Pr. Bh. seems not to have held that opinion. \u015aa\u1e45kara in his Bh\u0101\u1e63ya makes a distinction between the theories of Ka\u1e47\u0101da himself and those of his followers,\\(^2\\) the latter agreeing with Pr. Bh. \u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s statement of the process of combination is that two atoms make a binary atomic compound, and three and four atoms make a ternary and a quaternary atomic compound, and so on.\\(^3\\) Therefore, \u015aa\u1e45kara did not know the process mentioned by \u015ar\u012b-dhara. Also \u015ar\u012b-dhara\u2019s theory is not known to the author of V.S., and even among later Vai\u015be\u1e63ikas some writers are of the opinion that a trya\u1e47uka consists of three single atoms.\\(^4\\) Cf. notes on ch. i, 3, 6 (extension).\n\nThe definitions in this section of the treatise must be those of atoms. Accordingly the concepts of atoms here differ from V.S. and are similar to the quotations in \u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s Bh\u0101\u1e63ya.\\(^5\\) If V.S. 2, 1, 1\u20134 are definitions of atoms, the s\u016btras are contradictory to 2, 2, 2\u20135,\\(^6\\) because,\n\n\\(^1\\) No. 1185, pp. 60a, 91b.\n\n\\(^2\\) On 2, 2, 12.\n\n\\(^3\\) On 2, 2, 11.\n\n\\(^4\\) e.g. Mah\u0101deva Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da, the author of the Dina-kari, according to the Ny\u0101ya-k\u014d\u015ba, p. 314, and the Siddh\u0101nta-mukt\u0101vali, p. 69.\n\n\\(^5\\) On 2, 2, 16.

And water, having colour, taste, touch, fluidity, and viscosity (2, 1, 2), and fire, having colour and touch (2, 1, 3), cannot possibly be inferred from cold and heat (2, 2, 4\u20135). It must not be held that heat and cold are contained in touch, as explained in Pr. Bh.; otherwise water and fire must be inferred from touch, just as in the case of wind (2, 1, 9, and 4). Consequently, the proof of the existence of atoms in V.S. is to be regarded as under discussion in 2, 1, 8\u201313 and 2, 2, 1\u20135.\n\nOn the other hand, if earth has colour, taste, smell, and touch, it must be an aggregate of the four atoms. Now, touch is the attribute of wind, and wind is invisible; things conjunct with wind are invisible. The touch in earth is an effect, so that it presupposes another touch as its cause. Were earth as an aggregate a possessor of touch, which does not abide in a terrene atom, the touch would have no cause at all. In like manner the colour and touch in water and the touch in fire cannot be manifested, if the three attributes do not abide in an aqueous and an igneous atom. The atomic theory of the Vaisheshika is contradictory on this point. As a logical consequence, earth must have colour, taste, smell, and touch as intrinsic attributes; thus water is the possessor of colour, taste, touch (and fluidity, viscosity, and cold); fire of colour, touch (and heat); and wind of touch.\n\nAttributes in atoms are eternal, because the substrata are eternal; and in effects they are transitory. But colour, taste, smell, and touch in terrene atoms can also be transitory. Such are paka-ja.\n\n---\n\n1 Especially see p. 106.\n2 4, 2, 2\u20133; 8, 2, 4.\n3 Cf.

They are sometimes objective and sometimes subjective. Sense-organs are the juxtaposition of self with objects through mind, and are subjective as well as objective. Objects are the world common to all creatures. Others\u2019 bodies, sense-organs, and even selves are included in objects. One\u2019s own self, together with the body and the sense-organs, are sometimes treated as objective things.\\(^2\\) In the world there are no things composed of five or three elements. The body is composed of terrene atoms, and the sense-organs are composed respectively of the four atoms. The tripartite division is not strictly logical and rather a cross-division. But it depends upon the epistemological process.\n\n**Ether, Time, and Space (p. 93)**\n\nIn ancient Sanskrit literature ether (*ak\u0101\u015ba*) means empty space,\\(^3\\) and is not enumerated among elements. So also in Jainism.\\(^4\\) But later speculators reckon it as a fifth element. In V.S. ether is not treated as an element.\n\nEther is the substratum of the attribute sound; but it is not like earth, etc., as the substrata of colour, etc., and is not the material cause of the ear, as earth, etc., are the material causes of the other sense-organs. Ether is only one and has not two aspects, as a cause and an effect. It is inactive, like time and space, and all-pervading. It is by no means material, and naturally not subjective. Therefore ether in V.S. is held to be nothing other than\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) 4, 2, 1 f.\n\\(^2\\) 3, 1, 4; 3, 2, 4, etc.\n\\(^3\\) V. A.

W\u00f6rterb.* s.v.\n\\(^4\\) See the atomic theory of Jainism.\nthe cosmic vacuum, which contains all objects and gives room for their activities. Pr. Bh. and our treatise have different explanations from V.S., but the definition of ether in the treatise comes from V.S. 2, 1, 27.\n\nIn V.S. the proof of the existence of time (k\u0101la) runs, \"aparasminn apara\u1e41 yugapat ciraih k\u1e63ipram iti k\u0101la-lingai\u1e25.\"\u00b9 Pr. Bh. says, \"k\u0101la-para-apara-vyatikara-yaugapadya-ayaugapadya-cira-k\u1e63ipra-pratyaya-lingai\u1e25.\"\u00b2 The definition in the treatise comes from the latter.\n\n\"The cause of the notions\" (p. 93) is literally \"the cause of expression and recognition\". Kwh\u0113i-ci paraphrases this definition, \"the cause of expression and the cause of recognition.\" The original Sanskrit may have been prat\u012bti-vyavah\u0101ra-k\u0101ra\u1e47a or -hetu (the cause of recognition and expression). But Pr. Bh. has only pratyaya (notion). In the system \"word\" and \"concept\" have exactly the same meaning and are expressed by the same term (i.e. \u015babda). Consequently, \"expression and recognition\" may be quite correct as the translation of pratyaya; on the other hand, \"expression and recognition\" may simply be replaced by \"notion\". The Chinese \"expression and recognition\" can also be abridged to \"notion\".\n\n\"Cause\" is probably not the equivalent of li\u1e45ga or lak\u1e63a\u1e47a, but of k\u0101ra\u1e47a\u00b3 or hetu, because the translator usually distinguishes li\u1e45ga or lak\u1e63a\u1e47a (mark) from k\u0101ra\u1e47a.\u2074\n\nV.S. and Pr. Bh. describe the marks of the existence of time, i.e. how time is known, but the treatise describes the nature of time, i.e. what time is. Consequently, k\u0101ra\u1e47a is more appropriate than li\u1e45ga.\n\n\u00b9 2, 2, 6, \"The notions of posteriority in relation to posteriority, of simultaneity, of slowness and quickness are marks of the existence of time\" (Gough's translation).\n\u00b2 p. 63, \"Time is that which has the marks (of its existence) in the notions of simultaneity, non-simultaneity, slowness and quickness with respect to prior and posterior (things).\"\n\u00b3 See Upask\u0101ra on 7, 1, 25, where pratyaya-k\u0101ra\u1e47a is used.\n\u2074 Cf. notes on ch. ii, 7\u20138.\n\"Of simultaneity, non-simultaneity, slowness and quickness with respect to that and this (thing)\" (p. 93) is literally \"of (being) that, this, simultaneous, non-simultaneous, slow and quick\"; but \"being that and this\" must be understood by referring to para-apara-vyatikara in Pr. Bh., because in the treatise time has neither priority (that) nor posteriority (this).\n\nSpace (dis) is proved in V.S. as \"ita idam iti yatas tad-di\u015by\u0101\u1e41 ling\u0101\u1e41\",\u00b9 and in Pr. Bh. as \"dik p\u016brva-apara-\u0101di-pratyaya-ling\u0101\".\u00b2 \"Etc.\" implies the intermediate divisions of space, S.E., N.W., etc.\u00b3 Our treatise also defines what space is. In all other cases it defines the nature of things.\n\nTime and space, like ether, have each one eternal reality, but their effects are divers.\n\nAs for the all-pervading nature of time and space, V.S. says, \"gunair dig vy\u0101khy\u0101t\u0101\" and \"k\u0101ra\u1e47e k\u0101l\u0101\u1e25\".\u2074 According to Pr. Bh. and the treatise the attributes of time and space are only five\u2014number, extension, individuality, conjunction, and disjunction. The enumeration of the attributes agrees with V.S.\u2075\n\nNow the attributes common to all nine substances are only these five; it is accordingly impossible that the nature of all-pervadingness and inactivity in space is inferred from the five attributes (gu\u1e47a). Consequently the term gu\u1e47a in the passage of V.S. must have meaning other than the usual one, although it is rare in V.S. to ascribe two different meanings to the same term. V.S. says \"k\u0101rya - vi\u1e63e\u1e63e\u1e47a n\u0101n\u0101tv\u0101\u1e41\", \"\u0101ditya - sa\u1e41yog\u0101d\n\n\u00b9 2, 2, 10, \"The mark pertaining to space is that whence the knowledge arises that one thing is remote or not remote from another.\"\n\u00b2 p. 66, \"Space has the notions of the east, the west, and so forth as the marks (of its existence).\"\n\u00b3 V.S. 2, 2, 13\u201316; 2, 2, 7\u20139.\n\u2074 7, 1, 24\u20135, \"By its qualities space is explained (to be all-pervading),\" and \"Time relates to a cause\".\n\u2075 V.S. ascribes priority and posteriority to time and space, but not to ether. See notes on ch. ii, 1, 1.\nbh\u016bta-p\u016brv\u0101d bhavi\u1e63yato bh\u016bt\u0101c ca pr\u0101ci\u201d, \u201ctath\u0101 ca daksin\u0101 prat\u012bci udic\u012b ca\u201d, and \u201cetena dig-antar\u0101l\u0101ni vy\u0101khy\u0101t\u0101ni\u201d. These pr\u0101ci (east), daksin\u0101 (south), prat\u012bci (west), udic\u012b (north), and dig-antar\u0101l\u0101ni (the intermediate divisions) may be called guna (= up\u0101dh\u012b, limiting adjuncts) of space. As space is all-comprehensive in respect to these gunas which are universally pervasive, space is known to be all-pervading.\n\n\u201cK\u0101ra\u1e47e k\u0101la\u1e25\u201d undoubtedly relates to \u201cnitye\u1e63-abh\u0101v\u0101d anitye\u1e63u bh\u0101v\u0101t k\u0101ra\u1e47e k\u0101la-\u0101khyeti\u201d, and supports the above supposition. Time is applicable to the cause, so that time is also all-pervading.\n\nTime and space are necessarily inactive and can be asamav\u0101yi-k\u0101ra\u1e47a (non-inherent causes); but in Pr. Bh. they are called nimitta-k\u0101ra\u1e47a (efficient causes). These two substances have the same nature as ether, except that they have diversity in their effects and are non-inherent causes. What is, then, the essential difference between ether and space and time considered as causes? In what sense is it possible that these three substances have individually unity and are all-pervading at the same place and time? V.S. cannot satisfactorily answer the question. Pr. Bh. and the Sapta-pad\u0101rth\u012b may, as a logical consequence, be justified when they assert: \u201c\u0101k\u0101\u015ba-k\u0101la-di\u015b\u0101\u1e41 eka-ekatv\u0101d (i.e. vyakti-bhed\u0101-abh\u0101v\u0101t)\n\n---\n\n1 2, 2, 13\u201316, \u201cIts (space\u2019s) diversity is (caused to be conceived) by the difference of its effects,\u201d \u201c(Space is regarded as) east because of a past, future, or present conjunction of the sun,\u201d \u201cSo likewise (space is regarded as) south, west and north,\u201d and \u201cBy this (similarly) the intermediate divisions of space are explained\u201d.\n\n2 Sec Sapta-pad\u0101rth\u012b, p. 17, which is quoted at the end of this subsection.\n\n3 2, 2, 9, \u201cThe term time is applicable to a cause, inasmuch as it exists not in eternal and exists in not eternal things.\u201d\n\n4 7, 1, 24\u20135.\n\n5 p. 25.

Consequently time and space in the modern sense are in reality one. At any rate, the inactivity and asamav\u0101yi-k\u0101ra\u1e47atva of time and space are unsuitable for substances, because activity and samav\u0101yi-k\u0101ra\u1e47atva are two out of three characteristics of substances. And their five attributes are not special to them. Ether is an inherent cause, and has a special attribute, sound, but it is inactive. Candra-k\u0101nta, in his Bh\u0101sya on 1, 1, 15, says that ether is active, as it were, at the time of \u0101di-sarga (the first creation of the world).\n\nBut Pr. Bh.\u2019s opinion that the three substances are in reality one only shows the way to a logical consequence and has a contradiction in itself, because Pr. Bh. ascribes ultimate particularity (antya-vi\u1e63e\u1e63a) to the three. Cf. ch. i, 5; i, 6; i, 9; and ii, 5.\n\nSelf (\u0101tman), as one of the nine substances, is treated like the other material substances; but it has a great significance and is discussed throughout the third chapter of V.S. Some teachers start to prove the existence of self from the propositions \u201cthe objects of sense are universally known\u201d, and \u201cthe universal cognition of the objects of sense is an argument for (the existence of) objects other than the objects of sense\u201d.\u00b3 The author of V.S. does not approve of this proof and fully discusses the nature\n\n\u00b9 Pr. Bh., p. 58.\n\u00b2 Saptap., p. 17. The Candra-k\u0101nta-bh\u0101sya has the same opinion, 1, 1, 5; 2, 1, 27; 2, 2, 12; 7, 1, 24.\n\u00b3 3, 1, 1\u20132, \u201cprasiddh\u0101 indriya-artha-arth\u0101\u1e25,\u201d and \u201cindriya-artha-prasiddhir indriya-arthebhlyo\u2019rtha-antarasya hetuh\u201d. This explanation of the s\u016btras depends upon the Candra-k\u0101nta-bh\u0101sya, which is more reliable, especially in the third chapter, than the Upaskara and the Viv\u1e5bti.\nof proof. That the author is so careful in this matter shows that the proof, as well as self, is highly important in the system. The author's very proof of self is \"the ascending and descending vital airs (or the breathing out and in), the opening and closing of the eyes, life, motions of mind, affections of the other organs of sense, pleasure and pain, desire and aversion, and effort, are marks of existence of self (pr\u0101\u1e47a-ap\u0101\u1e47a-n\u012bme\u1e63a-unme\u1e63a-jivana-manogati-indriy\u0101ntaravik\u0101r\u0101\u1e25 sukha-du\u1e25kha-icch\u0101-dve\u1e63a-prayatn\u0101\u015b ca-\u0101tmano li\u1e45g\u0101ni, 3, 2, 4)\". These marks have evidently been obtained by comparison of a living with a dead body, and by observation of other persons.\u00b9 The proof is an indirect one and must presuppose one's own self-consciousness, which is entirely intuitive. The author seems to have been aware of this point and discusses it in 3, 2, 6\u201318, which show that self is essentially self-consciousness and directly proved. That self is self-consciousness in essence is quite natural in the system, because one of the principal tenets is that self is something different from cognition.\n\nIt is curious enough to observe that there is in the proof no mention of cognition as one of the attributes of self. But from the s\u016btras 3, 1, 18;\u00b2 3, 2, 1; 3, 2, 3; 3, 2, 19, etc., self is known to be the possessor of cognition, and the original text used by Pr. Bh. must have had it in the s\u016btra 3, 2, 4,\u00b3 and some Chinese translations also enumerate it.\n\nThe first half of the marks is by no means an indispensable part. N.S. abridges it thus: \"icch\u0101-dve\u1e63a-prayatna-sukha-du\u1e25kha-j\u00f1\u0101n\u0101ny-\u0101tmano li\u1e45gam\"\u2074; but it also uses the first half of the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika proof in the\n\n\u00b9 Cf. \u015aloka-v\u0101rttika, English translation, pp. 398\u2013400 (sl. 92\u2013101).\n\u00b2 The Candra-k\u0101nta-bh\u0101sya's explanation is reasonable.\n\u00b3 p. 70, ll. 12\u201313, \"\u0101tma-li\u1e45ga-adhik\u0101re buddhy-\u0101daya\u1e25 prayatna-ant\u0101\u1e25 siddh\u0101\u1e25.\" Cf.

The addition of impression, merit, and demerit is derived from Pr. Bh. But the intuitive nature of self is entirely unknown to the treatise.\n\n\"The recognition of an inherent cause (samav\u0101yi-k\u0101rana-pratyaya)\" needs some explanation. Samav\u0101yi-k\u0101rana, as a technical term, is always used with regard to substances only, except time and space, that is, substances are the samav\u0101yi-k\u0101ranas for attributes and actions. Samav\u0101yi-k\u0101rana means the cause (k\u0101rana) of attributes and actions by virtue of inherence (samav\u0101ya), or the cause (k\u0101ra\u1e47a) of inherence (samav\u0101ya) with respect to attributes and actions. Inherence is the intimate and inseparable connection of attributes and actions with substances, and substances are the causes of attributes and actions by virtue of inherence.\\(^2\\) This causality is spatial and lies within one substance. Consequently samav\u0101yi-k\u0101rana can be simply replaced by the term substratum for (or the possessor of) attributes and actions. In this relation the substance is always the cause, while attributes and actions are its effects. The whole meaning of the definition is as follows:\n\nThe attributes, cognition, etc., cannot exist apart from a substance, but they always reside in it, that is, they have a substratum, which is their samav\u0101yi-k\u0101rana. The notion that they must have a substratum leads to the conclusion that the substance exists. This substance is nothing but self. In this sense self is simply called the substratum of cognition, etc. Therefore the existence of self is proved from knowing that there are cognition, etc.\n\n\"Etc.\" in the definition may include pr\u0101na, etc., or\n\n\\(^1\\) 3, 1, 1-27.\n\n\\(^2\\) \"sva-samaveta-k\u0101rya-k\u0101ritvani samav\u0101yi-k\u0101ra\u1e47am ity-artha\u1e25.\"\nmay contain \"number\", and \"disjunction\", etc., if the commentators are reliable; but in Chinese \"etc.\" is often used to denote the plural number of the things enumerated in what precedes and does not serve to include things other than those enumerated.\n\nSelf in V.S. is all-pervading and in reality one, but it is manifold according to circumstances, and everyone has one. Pr. Bh. calls self aneka and apara-j\u0101ti-mat on the one hand, and sarva-gata, parama-mahat, and sarva-sa\u1e41yogi-sam\u0101na-de\u015ba on the other.\u00b9 The treatise is naturally of the same opinion, though the author does not distinctly mention the two sorts. See ch. i, 3, 6 (extension); ch. ii, 1, 5; ii, 2, 5; ii, 2, 8; ii, 3, 4.\n\nEther and self are immaterial; but the latter is conscious and active. With regard to the nature of self the system is in contrast with the Ved\u0101nta and the S\u0101\u1e41khya. The latter systems maintain that self is cognition itself (j\u00f1\u0101 and cit or cetan\u0101) and entirely inactive. In the Va\u012b\u015be\u1e63ika cognition is an effect of self, and self can recognize other things by means of cognition, so that self may be regarded as the knower (j\u00f1\u0101tr).\u00b2 The Ved\u0101nta holds that self is one, but manifold in its appearance, while the S\u0101\u1e41kliya insists upon the manifoldness of self (puru\u1e63a) as the fundamental thought of the dualistic system, though some teachers hold that puru\u1e63a in reality is one.\u00b3 In these respects V.S. agrees with the two systems.\n\nMind (p. 94)\n\nThe definition of mind (manas) differs from that of self only in \"a non-inherent cause (asamav\u0101yi-k\u0101ra\u1e47a)\".\n\n\u00b9 Cf.

V.S. and the treatise acknowledge only these two sorts of causality; but Pr. Bh. and later works add nimitta-k\u0101ra\u1e47a (the efficient cause). Asamav\u0101yi-k\u0101ra\u1e47a is usually divided into two sorts: \"non-inherent causality is causality inherent in one object connected with the relation of cause and effect; such causality results either from inherence in the same object with the effect (as that of conjunction of self and mind in the particular attributes of self, or of conjunction, disjunction, and sound in sound, or of conjunction of threads in a cloth), or from inherence in the same object with the cause (as that of the colour, etc., of potsherds, etc., in the colour, etc., of a water-pot, etc., or of the colour, etc., of threads in the colour of a cloth); of these the former is called in the terminology of the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika the lesser, the latter the greater.\"\u00b3\n\n\u00b9 3, 2, 1, \"Existence and non-existence of knowledge on contact of self with sense-organs and objects are the mark of the existence of mind.\"\n\n\u00b2 p. 89, \"Even when there is a contact of self with sense-organs and objects, we find that cognition, pleasure, and so forth are not produced, and from this we infer (the necessity of) another cause (for the production of cognition, etc.).\"\n\n\u00b3 Upask\u0101ra on 10, 2, 3-6; 2, 1, 22; 5, 2, 24. \"Asamav\u0101yi-k\u0101ra\u1e47atvau ca k\u0101rya-k\u0101ra\u1e47a-bh\u0101va-sambandhyek\u0101rtha-samaveta-k\u0101ra\u1e47atvai tac ca k\u0101rya-ek\u0101rtha-samav\u0101y\u0101t (yath\u0101-\u0101tma-manah-san\u012byogasya-\u0101tma-vai\u015be\u1e63a-gu\u1e47esu san\u012byoga-vibh\u0101ga-s\u0101bd\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 s\u0101bdetantu-san\u012byogasya pate) k\u0101ra\u1e47a-ek\u0101rtha-samav\u0101y\u0101d v\u0101 (yath\u0101 kapal\u0101di-r\u016bpadin\u0101\u1e41 gha\u1e6d\u0101di-r\u016bpadisu tantu-r\u016bpan\u0101\u1e41 pa\u1e6da-r\u016bpe\u1e63u) tatra-ady\u0101 laghv\u012b dvit\u012by\u0101 mahati-it\u012b vai\u015be\u1e63ika-paribh\u0101\u1e63\u0101.\"\nWhen self is in contact with sense-organs and objects, cognition, etc., sometimes occur and sometimes do not. This irregularity is caused by the presence or absence of another factor in the contact. That is to say, the conjunction of that factor with the other three factors can produce cognition, etc. If cognition, etc., have been produced, that factor is inferred to have been present, and the *asamav\u0101yi-k\u0101ra\u1e47a* for the production of cognition, etc., has been sufficient. That factor is nothing but mind.\n\nAs for the definition of self and mind, some commentators give curious explanations. They explain that self is the cause of cognition, etc., residing in (*samav\u0101ya*) self, and recognition, which is known to take place in self, is the mark of the existence of self. And mind is the *asamav\u0101yi-k\u0101ra\u1e47a* of cognition, etc., and the mark of mind is also the recognition produced in self. The Chinese translation may allow this reading; but mind as a substance cannot be *asamav\u0101yi-k\u0101ra\u1e47a* and recognition as the mark of both substances is an undistributed middle (*an\u0101ik\u0101ntika*).\n\nMind, like time and space, has not its own special attributes and is complementary to self, as time and space are to ether. Mind, though a necessary factor in the psychical process, is not at all mental, but entirely physical. Mind is active, and its first action comes from *adr\u0325\u1e63\u1e6da*. There is one mind in every body, and its extension is atomic (*a\u1e47u*).\u00b9 Mind is, in *V.S.*,\u00b2 sometimes called *antah-kara\u1e47a* (the internal organ), and *Pr. Bh.* regards it as one of the sense-organs\u00b3 (*indriya*), which view is not known to our treatise or to *V.S.*\n\nAmong the nine substances ether, time, and space are the place and condition for the other substances, and the other substances are divided into two classes, mental and material. The system is, therefore, a dualism and at\n\n\u00b9 Cf. *N.S.* 3, 2, 63.\n\u00b2 9, 1, 13.\n\u00b3 p. 186.\nthe same time a pluralism. The S\u0101\u1e41khya is also a dualism and a pluralism. In the S\u0101\u1e41khya the material factors are reduced to one prak\u1e5bti, but the mental are considered as plural. In the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika the mental factor is in reality one, while the material are always plural. The difference comes from different methods of thinking. The S\u0101\u1e41khya advocates the theory of emanation (pari\u1e47\u0101ma), while the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika adheres to the theory of aggregation (\u0101rambha). For the S\u0101\u1e41khya the first cause must be one; but for the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika the materials of aggregation cannot be simply one. See Professor Garbe, S\u0101\u1e41khya-Philosophie, pp. 285\u201390.\n\nSection 3.\u2014Attribute (pp. 94\u20138)\n\nColour, Taste, Smell, and Touch (p. 94)\n\nV.S. enumerates seventeen attributes, while Pr. Bh. adds seven others, and so makes up the twenty-four attributes. This number is the standard among later writers. Even the order of the attributes is preserved almost as in the treatise.\u00b9\n\nV.S. defines attribute in general, but it does not give the special definitions of colour (r\u016bpa), taste (rasa), smell (gandha), and touch (spar\u015ba). But from many passages colour, etc., are known to be perceived by the eyes, etc.\u00b2 Pr. Bh. defines colour, etc., cak\u1e63ur-gr\u0101hya\u1e43 (that which is perceived by the eyes), etc.\u00b3\n\nThe definitions in the treatise are literally \u201cone dependent, which is perceived by the eyes, is called colour\u201d, etc. Dependent (\u0101\u015brayin) in \u201cone dependent\u201d corresponds to \u201cquality\u201d or \u201cattribute\u201d. Earlier Chinese translators used the term \u201cdependent\u201d as the translation\n\n\u00b9 The Tarka-bh\u0101\u1e63\u0101 (p. 78) and the Tarka-sa\u1e45graha (p. 5) change the order, while the Laksan\u0101val\u012b, the Saptapad\u0101rth\u012b, the \u015aiddh\u0101ntamukt\u0101val\u012b (Bh\u0101\u1e63\u0101-pariccheda) and the Tarka-kaunudi have the same order as our treatise.\n\n\u00b2 2, 1, 1\u20134; 4, 1, 6\u201311; 8, 2, 5, 6.\n\n\u00b3 pp. 104\u20136.\nof gu\u1e47a. \"One\" does not, according to the commentators, directly qualify \"dependent\". Consequently, it must be rendered by \"the dependent on one\", or \"dependent having one substance as its substratum\". The commentators are quite correct. \"One substance\" here and in all the following passages means \"a particular individual substance\", not \"a kind of substance, e.g. earth\".\n\n\"The quality which has one substance (as its substratum)\" is not the exclusive condition of the four attributes, because it is applicable to actions and even to some substances too.\u00b9 And \"perceived by the eyes\", etc., can also be applied to substances and actions. Thus the definitions may be too wide. But \"perceived by the tongue or the nose\" is exclusive, and accordingly the definitions are allowable.\n\nNumber (p. 94)\n\nV.S. remarks \"because of occurrence apart from colour, taste, smell, and touch unity (ekatva) is a different object\"\u00b2 and \"numbers from duality (dvitva) upwards, individuality, conjunction, and disjunction (are originated by more than one substance)\".\u00b3 Pr. Bh. defines it \"eka-\u0101di-vyavali\u0101ra-hetu\u1e25 sa\u1e41khy\u0101 s\u0101 punar eka-dravy\u0101 ca-aneka-dravy\u0101 ca\".\u2074\n\nIt must be noted that number, as an attribute, is inherent in substances only and never in attributes or actions, because attributes and actions are agu\u1e47a or agu\u1e47avat. But attributes are always dependent upon substances, as the forms of appearance of the latter, and can be numbered one and two, etc. Cf. 8, 1, 4.\n\nThat attributes cannot possess an attribute in themselves is an important doctrine of the system.

Though there is not sarva-ekatva, which is an erroneous (bhr\u0101nta) notion, the existence of secondariness (bhakti) presupposes the existence of ekatva (unity), because there is no secondariness without unity.\n\n**Extension (p. 95)**\n\nThe definition of extension (parim\u0101\u1e47a) is given by Pr. Bh. as m\u0101na-vyavah\u0101ra-k\u0101rana.\\(^3\\) V.S. discusses extension in 7, 1, 8\u201325, and divides it into four kinds, large (mahat), small (anu), long (d\u012brgha), and short (hrasva).\n\nExtension produced in consequence of k\u0101rana-bahutva (a plurality of causes) is called large and is perceptible. Perception is possible of things which are large, because the things possess aneka-dravya (more than one substance) and r\u016bpa. Small is contrary to k\u0101rana-bahutva and is accordingly imperceptible. In like manner long and short are explained. The four kinds of extension are eternal, when they reside in eternal substances, and are non-eternal, when in non-eternal substances. The extension of atoms is called parimandala (sphericity), which is naturally always eternal. Ether and self together with time and space are (absolutely) large, because they are all-pervading (vibhu). Mind is small (anu). Sphericity and (absolutely) large are the two extremes, but they are not excluded from small and large.\\(^4\\) Sphericity is a part of small, and (absolutely) large is a part of large. Between them there are many relative extensions, and these\n\n\\(^1\\) 7, 2, 14\u201320.\n\\(^2\\) 7, 2, 5\u20136.\n\\(^3\\) p. 130, \"The cause of the usages of measure.\"\n\\(^4\\) See notes on ch. ii, 2, 1.\nrelative extensions are determined by the existence of particularity (vi\u015be\u1e63a-bh\u0101va) and the non-existence of particularity (vi\u015be\u1e63a-abh\u0101va), in things which exist at the same time.\n\nPr. Bh. precisely explains extension. Both small and large are of two kinds, eternal and non-eternal. Eternal smallness (nitya-a\u1e47u\u1e6dva) exists in atoms (param\u0101\u1e47u) and mind. These two are called spherical (p\u0101rimandalya). Non-eternal smallness is in binary atomic compounds (dvya\u1e47uka). Eternal largeness (nitya-mahattva) is in ether, time, space, and self, and is called absolutely large (parama-mahat). Non-eternal largeness is in from ternary atomic compounds (trya\u1e47uka) upwards. There are also relative extensions.\\(^1\\)\n\nThe definitions in the treatise are derived from Pr. Bh., but they differ therefrom in some aspects. The treatise explains the five kinds of extension. \u201cEtc.\u201d (l. 2) includes the intermediate extensions and corresponds to the relative extensions.\n\nSmallness (a\u1e47u\u1e6dva) resides in binary atomic compounds, i.e. binary atomic compounds are the samav\u0101yi-k\u0101rana of smallness. The binary atomic compound is the aggregation of two atoms, and its quantity is the same as the original two atoms. Smallness is the cause of the notions with respect to binary atomic compounds that they are small. Consequently smallness is a real entity in the objective world and corresponds to the concept small in the subjective world.\n\nIn V.S. the term a\u1e47u represents both atoms and the atomic extension; but in Pr. Bh. and our treatise a\u1e47u is the name of an extension and applicable to binary atomic compounds, not to atoms as such. Atoms are called parama-a\u1e47u in the latter. This is a difference between V.S., and Pr. Bh. and the treatise. Pr. Bh. seems to aim at precision, because parama-a\u1e47u as the name of atoms\n\n\\(^1\\) pp. 130\u20132.\ndoes not allow the term *anu* to be applied to them; their size is called *p\u0101rima\u1e47\u1e0dalya*, and ether, etc., are called *parama-mahat* instead of *mahat* in V.S. Consequently *anu* and *mahat* are only applicable to relative extensions and always non-eternal.\n\nIf mind is still called *anu*, it must be a binary atomic compound; therefore Pr. Bh. calls it *p\u0101rima\u1e47\u1e0dalya*. Kwh\u0113i-ci explains that \u201cmind is *anu*, corporeal, and as large as a binary atomic compound. But it has no (visible) extension; it is eternal\u201d. \u201cAs large as a binary atomic compound\u201d is the explanation of \u201cmind is *anu*\u201d. But if mind is *anu*, it cannot be eternal. Kwh\u0113i-ci\u2019s explanation involves a confusion and shows the development from V.S. to Pr. Bh.\n\nLargeness (*mahattva*) is in all things from ternary atomic compounds upwards and does not exist in binary atomic compounds. V.S. explains *mahat* by *aneka*. The commentators curiously explain this passage. According to their explanation two atoms conjoin together and produce a product, which is called the third product, and this third product conjoins with another third product and produces a product, which is called the seventh product.\\(^1\\) The seventh product is the beginning of largeness; accordingly, largeness is the extension of four atoms. \u015ar\u012bdhara also agrees with the explanation in this connection. \u201cA ternary atomic compound\u201d in the Chinese translation is literally \u201ca product of three atoms\u201d; but this is not consistent with the commentators\u2019 explanation. Therefore, the commentators take \u201ca product of three atoms\u201d for \u201ca product of the third atoms\u201d. The explanation is too far-fetched. It is quite natural to explain that every atom has no visible extension, while smallness begins with an aggregate of two atoms and largeness with an aggregate of three atoms. There is no reason at all in the treatise for changing this process\n\n\\(^1\\) See notes on ch. i, 2, 1\u20134 (earth\u2014wind).\nof combination. The commentators base their explanation upon a misunderstanding of Kwh\u0113i-ci\u2019s mention of the atomic combination. \u015ar\u012bdhara\u2019s theory is also not correct in this connection. \u015aa\u1e45kara in his Bh\u0101\u1e63ya states that atoms have smallness and shortness, and ternary and quaternary atomic compounds have largeness and length. The beginning of largeness and length is from a ternary atomic compound, which is the combination of three single atoms.\\(^1\\) If a ternary atomic compound is the combination of two binary atomic compounds, i.e. four atoms, there is a gap between smallness and largeness.\n\nPlurality (bahutva) in the treatise corresponds to k\u0101ra\u1e47a-bahutva in V.S. and is usually from three upwards. \u201cA kind of aggregation, or a certain aggregation\u201d is literally \u201caggregation-difference\u201d, which evidently shows that the original word was sa\u1e41gh\u0101ta-vi\u015be\u1e63a or sa\u1e41hata-vi\u015be\u1e63a.\n\nSphericity (p\u0101rima\u1e47\u1e0dalya) is applied to atoms, ether, time, space, and self; this is different from V.S. (anu) and Pr. Bh. (anu and manas). In Chinese \u201catom\u201d is translated \u201cabsolutely minute\u201d, which appears to be the equivalent of parama-anu. Anu is usually translated \u201cminute object\u201d,\\(^2\\) which is used by Kum\u0101ra-j\u012bva and others. \u201cAbsolute minuteness\u201d (parama-anutva) is the atomic extension, while \u201cabsolute largeness\u201d (parama-mahattva) is possessed by ether, etc. The author of the treatise understands mahat of ether, etc., in V.S., or parama-mahat in Pr. Bh. by p\u0101rima\u1e47\u1e0dalya, and calls it sarva-gata, etc. (= vibhu).\n\nThe author has failed to mention the extension of mind and has caused different opinions among later commentators. But the treatise asserts that the substances having absolute largeness are only four, and the substances having sphericity are the four atoms as well as the other\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) On 2, 2, 11.\n\n\\(^2\\) Some translators use \u201cthings contiguous to void\u201d.\nfive substances as causes.\\footnote{Ch. ii, 1, 5.} Consequently mind is included in sphericity, and is of \u201cabsolute minuteness\u201d. The author\u2019s understanding of ether as sphericity is probably due to its spherical appearance, and the other three substances follow the analogy of ether.\n\n\\textit{Individuality} (p. 95)\n\nIndividuality (\\textit{prthaktva}) is treated like number in \\textit{V.S.} and in \\textit{Pr. Bh}. The latter defines it as \\textit{apoddh\u0101ra-vyavah\u0101ra-k\u0101rana}.\\footnote{p. 138, \u201cThe cause of the expression of separateness.\u201d} The difference between number and individuality is that the former is synthetical, while the latter is analytical; but they depend upon each other. Individuality as an attribute has no individuality in itself. Consequently there is no individuality in two things, just as unity does not exist between two things. By these doctrines the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika rejects the \\textit{sat-k\u0101rya-v\u0101da} of the S\u0101\u1e45khya and the Ved\u0101nta.\\footnote{Professor Garbe, \\textit{S\u0101\u1e45khya-Philosophie}, pp. 228-233.} See \\textit{V.S.} 7, 2, 7\u20138; 7, 2, 13.\n\n\\textit{Conjunction and Disjunction} (pp. 95\u20136)\n\nThe before-mentioned attributes are static, while these two are rather dynamical and are the important factors in the system. \\textit{V.S.}\\footnote{7, 2, 9-10.} does not give exact definitions of them. \\textit{Pr. Bh}. defines conjunction \\textit{samyukta-pratyaya-nimitta}, and \\textit{apraptayok pr\u0101ptih}, and disjunction \\textit{vibhakta-pratyaya-nimitta}, and \\textit{pr\u0101pti-p\u0101rvik\u0101 apr\u0101ptih}.\\footnote{pp. 139, 151, \u201cThat which causes the cognition of the conjunct, and the conjoining of two separated things with each other,\u201d and \u201cThat which causes the cognition of the disjunct, and the separation of formerly conjoined things from each other\u201d.}\n\nThe definitions in the treatise exactly agree with the latter parts of the definitions in \\textit{Pr. Bh}. Kwh\u0113i-ci says that conjunction consists in the beginning of the conjunction between two separate things.\nConjunction is of three sorts, *anyatara-karma-ja*, *ubhaya-karma-ja*, and *samyoga-ja*. Kwh\u0113i-ci illustrates the first sort as occurring in the case of beating a drum with a hand, and the second sort in the case of clapping the hands. The definition of the third sort may also be translated \"the conjunction produced by conjunction is that in which many inactive substances conjoin with ether, etc., when produced (by the conjunction of the component substances)\". Kwh\u0113i-ci explains that \"the conjunction produced by conjunction is the conjunction of young shoots, etc., which are inactive, with the substances ether, etc., when they are sprouting\". Pr. Bh. says, \"*samyogajas tu utpannam\u0101trasya-eva cira-utpannasya v\u0101 niskriyasya k\u0101ra\u1e47a-samyo\u1e63ibhir ak\u0101ra\u1e47ai\u1e25 k\u0101ra\u1e47a-ak\u0101ra\u1e47a-samyo\u1e63a - p\u016brvakah k\u0101rya - ak\u0101rya-gata\u1e25 sa\u1e41yogah.*\"\u00b9 \"Ether\" in the treatise and Kwh\u0113i-ci's explanation corresponds to *ak\u0101ra\u1e47a* and *ak\u0101rya*, and \"an inactive thing, which consists of many substances (or many inactive substances)\" and \"young shoots\" to *utpannam\u0101tra-eva cira-utpanno v\u0101 niskriy\u0101h*. The whole meaning is that when things, which are in contact with ether, produce another thing by conjunction with other things, a conjunction again takes place between the product and ether. This last conjunction is the effect of the former conjunction.\n\nDisjunction may be understood by the analogy of conjunction.\n\nConjunction is possible between separate things; but inherence is the relation between unseparated things, and disjunction takes place after conjunction has taken place. The theories of conjunction and disjunction also support the *asat-k\u0101ry\u0101-v\u0101da*, which is the necessary consequence of the theory of aggregation and of the analytical observation of the six categories. Causality in the system has, like that in the Sarv\u0101sti-v\u0101da, a wider\n\n\u00b9 p. 139.\nmeaning than usual. Generally cause and effect do not occupy the same time; but in the system even substances are the causes of their attributes and actions. V.S. says, \"inasmuch as there is non-existence of unconnectedness, there is no conjunction and disjunction of an effect and its cause.\" And see 7, 2, 14\u201320.\n\nPriority and Posteriority (p. 96)\n\nV.S. remarks, \"eka-dikk\u0101bhya\u1e41 eka-k\u0101l\u0101bhya\u1e41 san-nik\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da-viprak\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101bhya\u1e41 param apara\u00f1 ca\" and \"k\u0101ra\u1e47a-paratv\u0101t k\u0101ra\u1e47a-aparatv\u0101t\". Pr. Bh. defines them, \"para-apara-abhidh\u0101na-pratyaya-minitta,\" and divides each of them into two sorts, \"dik-kr\u0325ta\" = \"dig-vi\u015be\u1e63a-praty\u0101yaka\" and \"k\u0101la-kr\u0325ta\" = \"vayo-bhedha-praty\u0101yaka\". They are fully explained.\n\nThe definitions in the treatise are derived from these two works and common to both k\u0101la-kr\u0325ta and dik-kr\u0325ta, because \"occupying the same time, etc.\" includes in \"etc.\" \"the same space\". The Chinese translations of paratva and aparatva are literally \"that-ness\" and \"this-ness\", which are applied to both k\u0101la-kr\u0325ta and dik-kr\u0325ta.\n\n\"The same time, etc.\", is literally \"one time, etc.\", and the translation of eka-k\u0101la, etc. Kwh\u0113i-ci explains that \"that-ness depends upon the numbers one, two, etc., and upon the substances time, space, etc. That-ness is that on which depends the notion of remoteness. This-ness is explained like that-ness\". The explanation keeps too much to the words and fails to be correct.\n\n1 7, 2, 13, \"yuta-siddhy-abh\u0101v\u0101t k\u0101rya-k\u0101ra\u1e47ayol\u012b san\u012byoga-vibh\u0101gau na vidyetc.\"\n2 7, 2, 21\u20132, \"The prior and posterior (are produced) by two objects occupying the same space or time and near and remote,\" and (\"priority and posteriority result) from posteriority of the cause and from priority of the cause\".\n3 p. 164, \"Those which cause the designation and the recognition of being near and remote.\"\n4 \"Relating to space\u2014causing the ideas of particular directions,\" and \"relating to time\u2014causing the ideas of the diversity of age\".\nCognition (p. 97)\n\nCognition (buddhi) is one of the most important factors in the system, because most parts of the system depend on inference. The relation between cognition and objects has been explained. If self as self-consciousness is looked upon as the innermost subject, cognition becomes objective; but, if cognition is subjective, self may be objective, as stated in the proof of self (3, 2, 4).\n\nThe definition of cognition is found only in the treatise. Cognition in V.S. is divided into two sorts, perception (pratyak\u1e63a) and inference (anum\u0101na). The latter is called laingika in V.S. These two sorts of cognition are the pram\u0101\u1e47as, and the system does not acknowledge other sorts of pram\u0101\u1e47a like \u015babda, etc., because \u015babda, etc., are included in inference.\\(^1\\)\n\nPerception in V.S. is of two sorts, laukika and alaukika. The term pratyak\u1e63a is used for the sensory cognitions from the five sense-organs; but it is sometimes used for the visual sensation only,\\(^2\\) because the visual sensation is typical of the sensory cognitions. In this sense pratyak\u1e63a is almost the same as dr\u1e63\u1e6da, c\u0101lku\u1e63a, and upalabdhi.\\(^3\\) In the terminology of V.S. the term upalabdhi is limited to visual cognition; accordingly Pr. Bh. is not correct when it asserts that buddhi, j\u00f1\u0101na, pratyaya, and upalabdhi are synonymous (pary\u0101ya).\\(^4\\) The conditions and possibility of perception of the nine substances, etc., will be fully explained in chapter ii.\n\nAlaukika-pratyak\u1e63a is mentioned in V.S. 9, 1, 11\u201315 and in Pr. Bh., p. 187, but it is omitted in the treatise.\n\nKwh\u0113i-ci explains that \u201caccording to the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika doctrine the eyes have light, and, when a man faces\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) 9, 2, 3; Pr. Bh., pp. 213\u2013230.\n\\(^2\\) 2, 1, 16; 8, 1, 2, etc.\n\\(^3\\) 4, 1, 11; cf. 4, 1, 12; 2, 1, 15\u201316; 4, 1, 6, etc.\n\\(^4\\) p. 171. This is an influence of N.S. on Pr. Bh. N.S. 1, 1, 15 says, \u201cbuddhir upalabdhir j\u00f1\u0101nam ity anarth\u0101ntaram.\u201d\ncoloured objects, the light reaches to the colour of the objects and he can perceive it, just as a lamp shines upon things. Sound, smell, and taste come to and touch the sense-organs respectively, and they are perceived. When a bell is sounded in the distance, its sound is heard after a little while. This proves that sound comes to the ear\". The explanation is confused with the Ny\u0101ya theory; but the other part is perhaps correct.\n\nThe cognitions of substances suppose (apek\u1e63\u0101) the substance, attributes, and actions, and those of attributes and actions have necessarily the substances as their causes; accordingly, the cognitions of attributes and actions do not suppose attributes and actions; attributes and actions have in themselves no attributes and actions.\\(^1\\) When we look at a white thing, the cognition of the white thing results from the whiteness of its substratum, and from the cognition of whiteness.\\(^2\\) Therefore the first impression is only \"the white thing\" without the distinction between whiteness and a thing. Next the first impression is analysed into the concepts, the attribute, whiteness, and the substance, a thing, and assumes the form, \"this thing is white.\" Between the white thing and its first impression, and between the first impression and the concepts, there are causal relations. This first impression corresponds to nirvikalpaka-pratyak\u1e63a (the perception without conception) and the analysed concepts to savikalpaka-pratyak\u1e63a (the perception with conception).\\(^3\\) The latter is called buddhy-apek\u1e63\u0101 and expressed by the words ayam (this), esa (this), tvay\u0101 k\u1e5bta (done by thee), and bhojaya enam (feed him), etc.\\(^4\\) Though this second sort is the indirect cognition of the immediate experience, it is included in the perception. The first sort of perception is explained in the first section (\u0101hnik\u0101) of\n\n\\(^{1}\\) 8, 1, 7; 8, 1, 4; 8, 1, 8.\n\\(^{2}\\) 8, 1, 9.\n\\(^{3}\\) 8, 2, 1.\nthe eighth chapter (adhy\u0101ya), while the second sort is in the second section.\\footnote{In the Ny\u0101ya the first stage of perception is regarded as the only perception. N.S., \"indriya-artha-sannikar\u1e63a-utpann\u0101\u1e41 j\u00f1\u0101nam avyapade\u015byam avyabhic\u0101ri vyavas\u0101ya-\u0101tmakam pratyak\u1e63am\" (1, 1, 4). If perception is avyapade\u015bya, the second sort cannot be a sort of perception. The second sort of perception relates to upam\u0101na and \u015babda. And the establishment of upam\u0101na and a part of \u015babda depends upon the theory that concepts and the corresponding objects have no connection (2, 1, 55).}\n\nThus all the analysed concepts result from immediate experiences. They are conveyed to fellow-creatures and acknowledged among them as representing definite things. And they are handed down from generation to generation. This is an important theory of the system. In this connection all cognitions are empirical on the one hand, and some of them are innate on the other. But there is no entirely transcendent cognition. Our concepts, which appear to be inborn, presuppose the experiences of former generations. The Veda, which is looked upon by the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e41s\u0101 as revelation, comes from the experiences of ancient sages (\u1e5b\u1e63i) and is consequently called buddhip\u016brva. The authority of the Veda is just the same as that of some of our concepts which are authoritative in daily life. And what is stated in the Veda has a corresponding entity, just as our concept has it. From the empirical standpoint comes the dogma that, where there is cognition, there is naturally the corresponding entity.\n\nThe definition of perception in the treatise is a general one. \"The sensory representation\" corresponds to the first impression, including the analysed concepts.\\footnote{See Pr. Bh., p. 186.} \"Appreciable substances\" corresponds to \"aneka-dravya-samav\u0101y\u0101t r\u016bpa-vi\u015be\u1e63\u0101c ca (r\u016bpa-upalabdhi\u1e25),\"\\footnote{V.S. 4, 1, 8, \"Perception of colour is consequent on inhesion of substances more than one, and on particularity of colour.\" N.S. 3, 1, 36 is exactly the same as this.} and is from ternary atomic compounds upwards. \"Colour and so on, residing in appreciable substances,\" is artha, one of\nthe four factors of perception (artha, indriya, \u0101tm\u0101n, and manas), and is explained by the commentators thus: the perception of colour, etc., supposes a substance, but the perception of sound does not suppose it. \"Sense-organs and so on\" includes self and mind. Cf. N.S. 2, 1, 20\u20135.\n\nInference takes place when the analysed cognition is active for immediate experiences or other indirect cognitions. Inference is divided into two sorts, usually la\u1e45gika (3, 1, 9\u201317; 9, 2, 1\u20135; and 1, 2, 1\u20132; 2, 1, 8; 2, 1, 24\u20137; 2, 2, 1) and \u0101r\u1e63a-siddha-dar\u015bana (9, 2, 13). The latter is mentioned in Pr. Bh.,\u00b9 but our treatise does not allude to it.\n\nPr. Bh. fully discusses inference, but it deviates from V.S. and accepts the theory of Dig-n\u0101ga. In the treatise inference is of two kinds; the first kind corresponds to 2, 1, 8, and the second to 3, 1, 9\u201317; 9, 2, 1\u20135.\n\nV.S. says that \"having horns, a hump, a tail hairy at the extremity, and a dewlap is the visible mark of being an ox\".\u00b2 This is similar to upam\u0101na in N.S. with a slight difference. Upam\u0101na is defined thus, \"analogy is the instrument (in the ascertaining) of that which is to be ascertained through its similarity to something (previously) well known.\"\u00b3 For instance, a man who has been told that the gavaya (Bos gaurus) is like a cow, sees an animal like a cow. Having recollected what he had heard, he concludes that \"this animal is a gavaya\". In this case a gavaya had not yet been experienced in fact, and exists vaguely in his concept. The reasoning is, therefore, that between two similar things. But in the case of V.S. 2, 1, 8 the inferred object is only one, and had been actually known. The reasoning is essentially\n\n\u00b9 pp. 258\u20139.\n\u00b2 2, 1, 8, \"vi\u1e63\u1e47u\u1e25 kakudv\u0101n pr\u0101nte-b\u0101ladh\u012b\u1e25 s\u0101sn\u0101v\u0101n iti gotve d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101ni li\u1e45gam.\"\n\u00b3 1, 1, 6, \"prasiddha-s\u0101dharmy\u0101t s\u0101dhy\u0101-s\u0101dhanam upam\u0101nam.\"\nfrom some parts, which can be seen, to the whole. The process of the reasoning is: first, one sees the characteristic parts, i.e. the mark (linga), then he recollects the object, which has the parts, and the connection of the parts with the object. The contact of self with mind is naturally present through the process. Finally he concludes that that is the object, although not all the parts of it are perceivable at the time. This reasoning is also applied to that from one thing to another of the same class. The definition is perhaps more appropriate to the latter case.\n\nThe second kind of inference is more logical and important. It is the reasoning from one thing (artha-antara) to another (artha-antara).\n\nV.S. says, \"asya idam k\u0101ryam k\u0101ra\u1e47ai\u1e25 sa\u1e41yogi virodhi samav\u0101yi ca-iti la\u1e45gikai\u1e25,\"\u00b9 \"sa\u1e41yogi samav\u0101yy-ek\u0101rtha-samav\u0101yi virodhi ca,\" and \"asya idam k\u0101rya-k\u0101ra\u1e47a-sambandha\u015b ca avayav\u0101d bhavati.\"\u00b2 Idam k\u0101ryai\u1e25, k\u0101ra\u1e47ai\u1e25, etc., are the conclusions of the reasoning and technically called \"pratij\u00f1\u0101 (thesis)\" in N.S., and asya indicates \"hetu (the reason)\", which is synonymous with apade\u015ba, linga, prama\u1e47a, and karana in V.S.\u00b3\n\nIdam k\u0101ryai\u1e25 is reasoning from cause to effect, e.g., \"from existence of the cause is existence of the effect,\" and \"from non-existence of cause is non-existence of effect.\"\u2074\n\nIdam k\u0101ra\u1e47ai\u1e25 is reasoning from effect to cause, e.g., \"the effect of a cause is the mark of the existence\n\n\u00b9 9, 2, 1, \"Inferential cognition is that one thing is the effect or cause of, conjunct with, repugnant to, or inherent in, another.\" The Candra-k\u0101nta-bh\u0101\u1e63ya remarks, \"eka-artha-samav\u0101yi ca-iti ca-arthah.\"\n\n\u00b2 3, 1, 9, \"The conjunct, the inherent, the inherent in one [and the same] thing, and the contradictory (are means of proof),\" and 9, 2, 2, \"That one thing belongs to another, the connexion of cause and effect, arises from a portion.\" V\u0101tsy\u0101yana, commenting on N.S. 3, 2, 44, quotes V.S. 3, 1, 9, and gives examples for each case. The example of virodhi is the quotation of V.S. 3, 1, 12.\n\n\u00b3 9, 2, 4.\n\n\u2074 4, 1, 3, \"k\u0101ra\u1e47a-bh\u0101v\u0101t k\u0101rya-bh\u0101vah,\" and 1, 2, 1, \"k\u0101ra\u1e47a-abh\u0101v\u0101t k\u0101rya-abh\u0101vah.\"\nof the cause,\u201d and \u201can attribute of an effect is observed to be preceded by an attribute of the cause\u201d.\u00b9\n\nId\u0101ni sa\u1e41yogi and samav\u0101yi are reasoning from sa\u1e41yukta and samaveta to sa\u1e41yogin and samav\u0101yin, e.g. (the cognition) of that which possesses conjunction (results from knowledge of the conjunct, e.g.) from a staff; and (the cognition) of that which possesses inhesion (results) from the particular mark.\u00b2\n\nId\u0101ni eka-artha-samav\u0101yi is reasoning from one thing to another, both of which reside in the same substance, e.g. one effect is (a mark of the existence) of another effect.\u00b3\n\nThe before-mentioned five sorts are altogether affirmative and correspond to Barbara in the Aristotelian logic.\n\nId\u0101ni virodhi is reasoning between two contradictory things. This is explained as \u201ca non-existent contradictory (is a mark) of the existent\u201d, \u201cthat which is actual (is\n\n\u00b9 4, 1, 2, \u201ctasya k\u0101rya\u1e41 li\u1e45gam,\u201d and 2, 1, 24, \u201ck\u0101rana-guna-p\u016brvakah k\u0101rya-gu\u1e47o d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dah.\u201d See 1, 2, 2, \u201cna tu k\u0101rya-abh\u0101v\u0101t k\u0101ra\u1e47a-abh\u0101v\u0101\u1e25.\u201d\n\nAccording to the rule of logic the s\u016btra 4, 1, 3 seems to be contradictory to s\u016btras 1, 2, 1; 1, 2, 2; 2, 1, 24, and 4, 1, 2. The rule tells us, if \u201ck\u0101ra\u1e47a-bh\u0101v\u0101t k\u0101rya-bh\u0101v\u0101\u1e25\u201d is correct, only \u201ck\u0101rya-abh\u0101v\u0101t k\u0101ra\u1e47a-abh\u0101v\u0101\u1e25\u201d can logically be inferred, while \u201ck\u0101ra\u1e47a-abh\u0101v\u0101t k\u0101rya-abh\u0101v\u0101\u1e25\u201d and \u201ck\u0101rya-bh\u0101v\u0101t k\u0101ra\u1e47a-bh\u0101v\u0101\u1e25 (i.e. tasya k\u0101rya\u1e41 li\u1e45gam)\u201d are not logically correct. The reason is that \u201cthe necessary relations between the antecedent and the consequence in a hypothetical proposition are only twofold: from affirmation of the antecedent to affirmation of the consequence, and from negation of the consequence to negation of the antecedent. The former is the express meaning of the proposition; accordingly the latter is the only logically possible reasoning. The other two ways, from negation of the antecedent to negation of the consequence, and from affirmation of the consequence to affirmation of the antecedent, are not logically valid\u201d. But 4, 1, 3 is stated from the standpoint of fact (i.e. Realgrund), while the other four s\u016btras are from the standpoint of reasoning (i.e. Erkenntnissgrund). In the former case the cause is the first principle in producing effects, but in the latter case the cause is the last principle to be known by us. Consequently they are not contradictory to each other; they are stated from different points of view. Such is an usual case in V.S.\n\n\u00b2 7, 2, 19, \u201csa\u1e41yogino da\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101t samav\u0101yino vi\u015be\u1e63\u0101c ca.\u201d\n\n\u00b3 3, 1, 10, \u201ck\u0101rya\u1e41 k\u0101rya-antarasya.\u201d\na mark) of that which is not actual,\u201d and \u201cthat which is actual (is a mark of something repugnant) which is actual\u201d.\u00b9 And in 2, 1, 25\u20136; 10, 1, 2\u20136. This is a negative case and corresponds to Cesare.\n\nIdam karyam, etc., are in relation to asya; consequently these six sorts represent the cases and conditions of hetu.\n\nIdam karyam is the same as the first explanation of p\u016brvavat in the Ny\u0101ya-bh\u0101\u1e63ya; idam k\u0101ra\u1e47am is the same as the first explanation of \u015be\u1e63avat, and idam samav\u0101yi is the same as s\u0101m\u0101nyato d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da in the second explanation. S\u0101m\u0101nyato d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da in the first explanation and p\u016brvavat in the second explanation sometimes agree with idam k\u0101ryam and k\u0101ra\u1e47am, and sometimes with idam sanav\u0101yi.\u00b2 Idam virodhi has an equivalent in N.S. 1, 1, 35 and 37, while idam sa\u1e41yogi and ek\u0101rtha-samav\u0101yi are not clearly stated in N.S.\n\n\u015ae\u1e63avat in the second explanation of V\u0101tsy\u0101yana is a special case of idam virodhi. This is used in V.S. 2, 1, 25\u20137 and N.S. 3, 2, 42. Pr. Bh. uses this mode of proof thrice,\u00b3 but in the latter three works it is named pari\u015be\u1e63a. V.S. 2, 2, 1, is also a case of this \u015be\u1e63avat, and is the method of residue in Mill\u2019s terminology.\n\nIndian logic in general is not pure reasoning or inference, but is proof and accordingly methodological. In V.S. as well as N.S. the reasoning is also proof. The proof in the former is more conceptual than in the latter, and seems to be more advanced.\n\nAsya idam karyam, etc., contain two or three important relations. Idam is the subject of the pratij\u00f1\u0101 (dharmin, anumeya, vi\u015be\u1e63ya), and k\u0101ryam, etc., are the predicates (dharma, li\u1e45gin, vy\u0101paka, vi\u015be\u1e63a, gamya).\u2074 Asya indicate\n\n\u00b9 3, 1, 11, \u201cvirodhy-abh\u016btam bh\u016btasya\u201d; 3, 1, 12, \u201cbh\u016btam abh\u016btasya\u201d; and 3, 1, 13, \u201cbh\u016bto bh\u016btasya.\u201d\n\u00b2 See the Introduction.\n\u00b3 pp. 58, 69, 288.\n\u2074 \u015aloka-v\u1e5bttika, Anum\u0101na-pariccheda, \u015bl. 2\u201316.\nhetu (linga, vy\u0101pya, gamaka). The relation between vy\u0101pya and vy\u0101paka is called vy\u0101pti, and is exhibited in the ud\u0101harana (or dr\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101nta). Therefore, vy\u0101pti is the condition between the subject and the predicate in the ud\u0101harana (the major premiss). And vy\u0101pti in the case of idam virodhi is called vyatireka-vy\u0101pti, while that in the other five cases is anvaya-vy\u0101pti. These names are given by later writers, but the essence is found in V.S.; it seems to be strange to N.S.\n\nThe relation between linga and anumeya is also not known to N.S., but it is an important factor in Dig-n\u0101ga\u2019s logic, which is followed by Pr. Bh., Siddha-sena, Kum\u0101rila, and Prabh\u0101-kara.\u00b9 This relation is the condition between the subject and the predicate of the hetu in the form of a proposition (the minor premiss). There are contained here the essential conditions of hetu, i.e. the tri-r\u016bpa-linga of hetu. The tri-r\u016bpa-linga consists of the relation between linga and anumeya, and of the anvaya-vy\u0101pti and the vyatireka-vy\u0101pti. See Pr. Bh., p. 200 (a traditional verse) and p. 204.\n\n\u201cAny invisible objects\u201d in the treatise means that the inferred objects are not necessarily seen, and shows that the second sort of inference is more conceptual than the first sort. \u201cThe cause of them\u201d corresponds to idam k\u0101ryam, \u201cthe effect of them\u201d to idam k\u0101ra\u1e47am, \u201ca thing conjunct with them\u201d to idam sa\u1e41yogi, \u201ca thing inherent in the same object\u201d to idam ek\u0101rtha-samav\u0101yi, and \u201ca thing contradictory to them\u201d to idam virodhi. Idam samav\u0101yi is probably included in \u201ca thing inherent in the same object\u201d, or is analogically understood by \u201ca thing conjunct with them\u201d. Cf. ch. ii, 2, 5 (inference).\n\n\u00b9 See Ny\u0101ya\u015b\u0101stra (Calcutta,1909), \u015aloka-v\u0101rttika (anum\u0101na-pariccheda), \u015a\u0101stra-d\u012bpik\u0101 (Pandit, vol. viii, pp. 54 f., 1886), Prakarana-pa\u00f1cik\u0101 (Pandit, vol. i, pp. 44 f.), The Pr\u0101bh\u0101kara School (pp. 42 ff.); cf. Ny\u0101ya-bindu (the second and the third chapters), Ny\u0101ya-v\u0101rttika (noted in the Introduction).\nKwh\u0113i-ci explains: \"the first sort is reasoning in which the major term, i.e. the predicate of the pratij\u00f1\u0101, is ascertained by seeing an uncontradictory property, e.g. fire is proved by seeing smoke. The second sort is that in which the major term is concluded from seeing a contradictory property, e.g. the breaking of rice-plants is inferred from seeing hail, and hail is proved by seeing the breaking of rice-plants.\" The explanation probably depends upon ch. ii, 2, 5, but \"an uncontradictory property\" as the explanation of \"a common property\" is too wide, and \"a contradictory property\" is too narrow and cannot properly explain the second sort.\n\nCandra-k\u0101nta differently explains the reasoning in V.S., and classifies it under two sorts, vi\u015besato dr\u1e63\u1e6da and s\u0101m\u0101nyato dr\u1e63\u1e6da.\u00b9 But the classification is not sufficiently comprehensive.\n\nAs for fallacies, V.S. mentions them in 3, 1, 15\u201317 and 3, 1, 1\u20138,\u00b2 but the treatise does not allude to them.\n\nPleasure and Pain (p. 97)\n\nV.S. says, \"i\u1e63\u1e6da-an\u012b\u1e63\u1e6da-k\u0101ra\u1e47a-vi\u015be\u1e63\u0101d virodh\u0101ca mith\u0101\u1e25 sukha-du\u1e25khayor artha-antara-bh\u0101val,\"\u00b3 and Pr. Bh. defines them \"anugraha-lak\u1e63a\u1e47am sukha\u1e41\" and \"upagh\u0101ta-lak\u1e63a\u1e47am du\u1e25kham.\"\u2074 Pleasure (sukha) and pain (du\u1e25kha) are produced by contact of the four factors, just as in the production of cognition;\u2075 accordingly, V.S. 10, 1, 2\u20137 proves that pleasure and pain are something different from cognition. Pleasure and pain belong to emotion, while cognition is intellect and effort is volition.\n\n\u00b9 p. 48.\n\u00b2 See Candra-k\u0101nta-bh\u0101\u1e63ya.\n\u00b3 10, 1, 1, \"Inasmuch as the causes of the desirable and the undesirable are different and opposed, the relation of pleasure and pain is that of reciprocally different objects.\"\n\u2074 pp. 259\u201360, \"The characteristic of pleasure is satisfaction\" and \"the characteristic of pain is suffering\".\n\u2075 5, 2, 15.\nDesire and Aversion (p. 97)\n\nDesire (icch\u0101) and aversion (dve\u1e63a) arise from pleasure and pain, and through ad\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da or j\u0101ti-vi\u1e63e\u1e63a (particularity of race). They are derivative; pleasure and pain are passive, while desire and aversion, caused by pleasure and pain, are active. Consequently, desire and aversion cause transmigration. Pr. Bh. defines them, \u201csv\u0101rtham par\u0101rtham v\u0101 \u2019pr\u0101pta-pr\u0101rthana-icch\u0101\u201d and \u201cprajvalan\u0101-\u0101tmako dve\u1e63\u0101\u1e25, yasmin sati prajvalitam iva-\u0101tm\u0101nam manyate sa dve\u1e63\u0101\u1e25\u201d.\n\nEffort (p. 97)\n\nV.S. does not define effort (prayatna), but effort is the cause of actions physical and mental. In some cases effort is produced unconsciously. Pr. Bh. divides it into two sorts, j\u012bvana-p\u016brvaka (unconscious) and icch\u0101-dve\u1e63a-p\u016brvaka (conscious). Kwh\u0113i-ci explains, \u201cwhere there occurs an action to do something, there is a volition (uts\u0101ha) preceding the action. This is effort.\u201d The definition in this passage does not clearly mention the unconscious effort, but the next chapter alludes to it.\n\nThe before-mentioned seventeen attributes are enumerated in V.S. as attributes, and the last six are the special attributes of self not common to any other substances.\n\nGravity (pp. 97\u20138)\n\nThe following seven attributes are added by Pr. Bh. to the seventeen. Gravity (gurutva) is mentioned in Pr. Bh. as \u201cjala-bh\u016bmyoh patana-karma-k\u0101ra\u1e47ai\u1e25\u201d. This agrees\n\n1 6, 2, 10\u201313.\n2 pp. 261\u20132, \u201cDesire is the wishing for something not obtained, either for one\u2019s own sake or for the sake of another,\u201d and \u201cAversion is of the nature of heart-burning or irritation. It is the feeling that makes one think himself burning or being irritated\u201d (Ga\u1e45g\u0101-n\u0101tha Jh\u0101\u2019s translation).\n3 p. 263.\n4 p. 263, \u201c(Gravity is) the cause of the action falling of water and earth.\u201d\nwith V.S. 5, 1, 7; 5, 1, 18; 5, 2, 3. But V.S. 1, 1, 29 ascribes to gravity causation of the action throwing upwards. Pr. Bh. follows this s\u016btra in the explanation of the action; but our treatise does not mention it. Gravity is, if there is no impression (sa\u1e43sk\u0101ra) and conjunction, the cause of falling down; accordingly, gravity can be the absolute cause (anapek\u1e63a-k\u0101ra\u1e47a) of conjunction and disjunction. This is contradictory to the essential nature of attributes (1, 1, 16).\n\n**Fluidity and Viscidity** (p. 98)\n\nPr. Bh. explains, \"dravatva-syandana-karma-k\u0101ra\u1e47am, tri-dravya-v\u1e5btti, tat tu dvividham sa\u1e43siddhika\u1e41 naimittika\u1e41 ca, sa\u1e43siddhika\u1e41 ap\u0101\u1e41 vi\u015be\u1e63a-gunah, naimittikam prthiv\u012b-tejasoh sa\u1e43\u0101nya-gunah.\"\u00b9 According to V.S. fluidity (dravatva) is possessed by water, and the cause of flowing (syanda).\u00b2 Fluidity exists in butter, lac, wax, tin, lead, iron, silver, and gold, through their conjunction with fire.\u00b3\n\nConcerning viscosity (sneha) V.S. says, \"\u0101po drav\u0101\u1e25 snigdh\u0101\u1e25,\"\u2074 and there is no further allusion to it. Pr. Bh. defines it \"sneho p\u0101\u1e41 vi\u015be\u1e63a-gunah sa\u1e45graha-mrij\u0101dihetul\u1e25\".\u2075 The definitions in our treatise are derived from Pr. Bh. But fluidity and viscosity are not attributes in the strict sense.\n\n**Impression** (p. 98)\n\nImpression (sa\u1e43sk\u0101ra) in V.S. may be divided into two sorts; according to 9, 2, 6\u20138 and 9, 2, 10, impression is a cause of reminiscence (sm\u1e5bti), dreaming (svapna),\n\n\u00b9 p. 264, \"Fluidity is the cause of the action flowing and exists in the three substances. But it is (divided into) two sorts, intrinsic and extrinsic. The former is a specific attribute of water, while the latter is a common attribute to both earth and fire.\"\n\n\u00b2 2, 1, 2; 5, 2, 4.\n\n\u00b3 2, 1, 6\u20137.\n\n\u2074 2, 1, 2.\n\n\u2075 p. 266, \"Viscosity is a specific attribute of water and the cause of cohesion, smoothness, etc.\"\nconsciousness in dreaming (svapn\u0101ntika), and imperfect knowledge (avidy\u0101), while according to 5, 1, 7; 5, 1, 18; and 4, 1, 7, it is produced from the first action of things, and is the cause of the second action, and so forth. Consequently, impression is an impressed energy, physical and mental. Pr. Bh. divides it into three sorts, impetus (vega), mental impression (bh\u0101van\u0101), and elasticity (sthiti-sth\u0101paka),\u00b9 and says, \u201cvego m\u016brtimatsu pa\u00f1casu dravye\u1e63u nimitta-vi\u015be\u1e63a-apek\u1e63\u0101t karmano j\u0101yate niyata-dik-kriy\u0101-prabandha - hetuli spar\u015bavat - dravya - samyoga - vi\u015be\u1e63a - virodhi (kvacit k\u0101rana-guna-p\u016brva-krama\u1e47ena-utpadyate); bh\u0101van\u0101-samj\u00f1akas tv-\u0101tma-gu\u1e47o d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da-\u015bruta-anubh\u016btesv-artha\u015bu sm\u1e5bti-pratyabhij\u00f1\u0101na-hetur bhavati.\u201d\u00b2 Bh\u0101van\u0101 corresponds to the first sort of impression in V.S.\n\n\u201cThe cause of reminiscence\u201d is the translation of sm\u1e5bti-hetu, and \u201ca particular mental impression\u201d corresponds to sm\u1e5bti-pratyabhij\u00f1\u0101na in Pr. Bh., but it is literally \u201crepeated-exercise-difference\u201d and may be the translation of abhy\u0101sa-vi\u015be\u1e63a or bh\u0101van\u0101-vi\u015be\u1e63a.\u00b3 \u201cProduced by the impressions of the perceptive and the inferential knowledge of one substance,\u201d corresponds to d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da-\u015bruta-anubh\u016btesv-artha\u015bu. In Pr. Bh. sm\u1e5bti is an effect of bh\u0101van\u0101 and one of the four sorts of perfect knowledge (vidy\u0101); but in our treatise sm\u1e5bti is not included in perfect knowledge. Sm\u1e5bti is the cause as well as the effect of perfect knowledge.\n\nImpetus is a cause of actions and at the same time an effect of actions in V.S. 1, 1, 20; 1, 1, 30;\u2074 1, 1, 27.\u2075 \u201cThe cause of actions,\u201d or \u201cthe cause of activity\u201d is the\n\n\u00b9 p. 266, \u201cImpetus is produced in the five corporeal substances by an action through some causes; it is the cause of a series of motions in a definite direction; it is counteracted by a certain conjunction of tangible substances,\u201d and \u201cwhat is called mental impression is an attribute of self; it is the cause of the remembrance and recognition of things previously seen or heard or experienced.\u201d\n\n\u00b2 Cf. p. 156.\n\n\u00b3 See Pr. Bh., pp. 156, 266.\n\n\u2074 The s\u016btra of the Candra-k\u0101nta-bh\u0101\u1e63ya.\n\n\u2075 The s\u016btra of the Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja-v\u1e5btti-bh\u0101\u1e63ya.\ntranslation of kriy\u0101-hetu, or it may be that of k\u1e5bti-hetu, but k\u1e5bti is more mental than physical.\\(^1\\) \u201cImpulsion, etc.,\u201d is literally \u201cstriking, or throwing, etc.,\u201d and is the translation of nodana, and \u201cetc.\u201d includes \u201cabhigh\u0101ta (impact)\u201d and \u201csa\u1e41yukta-sa\u1e41yoga (conjunction with the conjunct).\u201d\\(^2\\) \u201cImpetus, or physical energy\u201d is the equivalent of vega. \u201cThe corporeal substances\u201d are five: earth, water, fire, wind, and mind. \u201cHas one substance as its substratum\u201d states the essential nature of actions (1, 1, 17).\n\nImpetus (vega) is dynamic, while elasticity (sthiti-sth\u0101paka) is rather static (inertia). The latter is not clearly set out in V.S., and even Pr. Bh. does not allude to it in other passages;\\(^3\\) but impetus (seven times) and mental impression (bh\u0101van\u0101) (five times) are mentioned\\(^3\\) in other passages. The treatise refers to elasticity in the explanation of actions.\n\n**Merit and Demerit** (p. 98)\n\nIn Pr. Bh. ad\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da has the same meaning as merit (dharma) and demerit (adharma), because the seven additional attributes are enumerated as gurutva, dravatva, sneha, sa\u1e41sk\u0101ra, ad\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da, and \u015babda.\\(^4\\) In V.S. ad\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da is mentioned in 5, 1, 15; 5, 2, 2; 5, 2, 7; 5, 2, 13; 5, 2, 17\u201318; 6, 2, 2; 6, 2, 13. The first four or five s\u016btras describe it as an objective force, and the last three treat it as subjective; but even the first four may also be explained subjectively; accordingly, ad\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da is considered as the latent energy residing in self and the final cause of transmigration, because it is stated, \u201ctad-abh\u0101ve sa\u1e41yoga-abh\u0101vo \u2019pr\u0101dur-bh\u0101va\u015b ca mok\u1e63al\u1e25,\u201d\\(^5\\) and tad is undoubtedly ad\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Ny\u0101ya-k\u014d\u015ba, pp. 733\u20134, 211, 523. Pr. Bh. distinctly calls impetus one of kriy\u0101-hetus (p. 101). See notes on ch. ii, 2, 9.\n\n\\(^2\\) 5, 2, 1; 5, 2, 6.\n\n\\(^3\\) pp. 95\u2013102.\n\n\\(^4\\) p. 10, \u201cad\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da-\u015babdena dharma-adharmayor upasanigrahah\u201d (Ny\u0101ya-kandali).\n\n\\(^5\\) 5, 2, 18, \u201cWhere there is non-existence of this (that is, of destiny), there is non-existence of conjunction and non-existence of manifestation, emancipation.\u201d\nAd\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da is very similar to impression (sa\u1e43sk\u0101ra), which as \"the cause of reminiscence\" is partly coincident with it; but impression is rather mechanical and mental, while ad\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da is moral and religious. Ad\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da principally means a latent force resulting from the actions in the previous life and continuing to exist in the present life. This ad\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da causes the first action of the natural phenomena, as explained in ch. ii, 3. The theory of ad\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da is very likely to lead to the conclusion that the sphere of transmigration is the common result of the individual ad\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da, and everyone's body and other personal circumstances are the special results of the individual ad\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da. This is a general idea in Buddhism.\n\nBut ad\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da is not the ad\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da of God in V.S.: God is not mentioned in V.S., though the Upask\u0101ra and the Viv\u1e5bti maintain that V.S. acknowledges the existence of God. Their explanations will be examined.\n\nThe commentators explain that the s\u016btras \"sa\u1e43j\u00f1\u0101-karma tv-asmad - vi\u015bi\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101n\u0101m li\u1e45g\u0101n\" and \"pratyak\u1e63a-prav\u1e5bttatv\u0101t sa\u1e43j\u00f1\u0101-karman\u0101\u1e25\"\u00b9 are the proof of the existence of God. But this is hardly possible, because an important discussion like the proof of God should be found in its proper place; the author of the s\u016btra discusses the proof of self in the whole third adhy\u0101ya. The two s\u016btras are really the author's answer to an opponent (2, 1, 15\u201317). The author proves the existence, the invisibility, the substantiality, the eternity, and the multiplicity of wind in 2, 1, 9\u201314. Then an opponent says, \"v\u0101yu-sannikar\u1e63e pratyak\u1e63a-abh\u0101v\u0101d d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101n li\u1e45g\u0101n na vidyate,\" \"sa\u1e43\u0101nyato d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101c ca-avi\u015be\u1e63al,\" and \"tasmin \u0101gamika\u1e41\"\u00b2 (2, 1, 15\u201317). The author answers the\n\n\u00b9 2, 1, 18\u201319, \"But word and work are the mark of those beings who are distinguished from ourselves,\" and \"because words and works are known by perception to be produced.\"\n\n\u00b2 \"Inasmuch as in the contact with wind there is no act of perception, there exists (in it) no visible mark,\" and \"(even) by general inference it is not a particular (substance),\" and \"it is therefore proved by revelation (the Veda).\"\nobjections in the two s\u016btras. The s\u016btras mean that some of our concepts have their origin in the perceptions of former generations and have been handed down to us. And they are the logical ground for the proof of the corresponding objects and the criterion of our actions.\\(^1\\)\n\nThe above explanation will be also proved by 3, 2, 4\u20139. The author proves the existence, the substantiality and eternity of self in 3, 2, 4\u20135, and the objections are raised in 3, 2, 6\u20138,\\(^2\\) in almost the same words as in 2, 1, 15\u201317. S\u016btra 3, 2, 9 is the author\u2019s answer to the objections, just as s\u016btras 2, 1, 18\u201319 are to s\u016btras 2, 1, 15\u201317. If s\u016btras 3, 2, 6\u20138 are the objections, as the commentators explain, s\u016btras 2, 1, 15\u201317 must be objections, because the words and the line of argument are the same; then s\u016btras 2, 1, 18\u201319 must be the answer to them. They cannot be the proof of God. And other s\u016btras have no trace of the proof of God; therefore it is concluded that V.S. does not acknowledge the existence of God. Pr. Bh. for the first time acknowledged \u201cBrahm\u0101 sakala-bhuvana-patir mahe\u015bvaral\u0101\u1e25\u201d and \u201cBrahm\u0101 sarva-loka-pit\u0101mah\u0101\u1e25\u201d.\\(^3\\) But this is an influence from a theistic system.\\(^4\\)\n\nMerit (dharma) and demerit (adharma) are mentioned in V.S.

The whole system of the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika is included in *dharma* (1, 1, 1), and this *dharma* is divided into two divisions (*dharma-vi\u015be\u1e63a*) (1, 1, 2). The one (*dharma-vi\u015be\u1e63a*) is *tattva-j\u00f1\u0101na* of the six categories, and the other (*dharma-vi\u015be\u1e63a*) is the religious practices derived from the *Veda* (6, 1, 1\u201316; 6, 2, 1\u20139; 10, 2, 8\u20139).

Bh., but the treatise explains them too concisely.\n\n\"Activity\" in the treatise is the translation of prav\u1e5btti. \"A desirable body, etc.,\" is the result of merit and happy conditions in the deva- and the manusya-loka. \"Activity destroys one substance by its effect\" is explained by the commentators as follows: After a man has got rid of the present body and conditions, he can obtain, owing to the activity of merit, a happy body and condition in the next life. One substance is the body in the present life, and its effect is a happy and desirable body in the next life. Both are contrary and do not exist at the same time. Pr. Bh. says, \"dharm\u0101\u1e25 puru\u1e63a-gu\u1e47\u0101\u1e25 kartuh priya-hita-mok\u1e63a-hetu\u1e25 atindriyo 'ntya-sukha-sa\u1e41vij\u00f1\u0101na-virodhi\" (this refers to the two sorts of merit, priya-hita to prav\u1e5btti and mok\u1e63a to niv\u1e5btti). By the help of the commentators and Pr. Bh. the definition in the treatise may be understood. Kwh\u0113i-ci explains that \"activity is the cause of obtaining a desirable body, that is, the cause of an excellent body in the cycle of transmigration\".\n\n\"Cessation\" is niv\u1e5btti. \"Delight in perfect cognition, which is free from attachment\" can be understood by the help of Pr.

Bh. says, \"adharmo 'py-\u0101tma-gu\u1e47a\u1e25 kartur ahita-pratyav\u0101ya-hetur at\u012bndriyo 'ntya-du\u1e25khasa\u1e41vij\u00f1\u0101na-virodhi,\" and \"prak\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101d adharm\u0101t svalpa-dharma-sahit\u0101t preta-tiryagyoni-sth\u0101ne\u015bv-an\u012b\u1e63\u1e6da-sarira-indriya-vi\u1e63aya-du\u1e25kh\u0101dibhir yogo bhavati.\"\u00b9\n\nIt will be seen that merit and demerit cannot properly be attributes in the strict sense.\n\nAccording to V.S. the present life in the cycle of transmigration is the result of adr\u0325\u1e63\u1e6da. Pleasure and pain are produced by contact of self with mind, sense-organs, and objects (5, 2, 15). Pleasure and pain cause desire and aversion; desire and aversion impress merit and demerit on self; and this merit and demerit are adr\u0325\u1e63\u1e6da for the next life (6, 2, 10\u201316). Among self, mind, sense-organs, and objects the two last are neutral, and self is one and all-pervading in its real nature. Mind plays the principal part in the production of cognition, reminiscence, dreaming, and consciousness in dreaming, and especially of pleasure and pain. Consequently, for the attainment of emancipation it is necessary to restrain the mind. Restraint of mind is succeeded by yoga, which is defined: \"Absence of action in mind reposing in self; non-existence of pain in the body\u2014this is any merit or demerit; the merit and demerit of his previous lives being exhausted by his experiences of pleasures and pains, and all affections, etc., having ceased, all his actions henceforth are only such as are of the nature of pure merit, tending towards cessation; and these actions produce in him the happiness of contentment and the disregard for the body; and, having brought about happiness due to the vision of the highest truth, this merit also disappears, the self becomes seedless, and the present body falling off it takes no other bodies, and this cessation of equipment with bodies and so forth... constitutes what is called emancipation\" (Ga\u1e45g\u0101-n\u0101tha Jha's translation).\n\n\u00b9 pp. 280\u20131, \"Demerit is an attribute of self; it brings about to the agent unhappiness and unpleasantness; it is supersensuous: it is destroyed by the experiencing of the last item of pain,\" and \"pronounced demerit, accompanied by a slight touch of merit, brings about the combination (of the self) with undesirable body, sense-organs, objects and pains in the world of ghosts and animals\".\nyoga.\u201d\u00b9 By practising yoga ad\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da, which causes the egress and ingress of mind from, and into, bodies, etc., can be extinguished (5, 2, 17). After that the conjunction with new bodies is stopped, and a new life never takes place. This is emancipation (5, 2, 18; 6, 2, 16). Pr. Bh. calls emancipation \u201cdagdha-indhana-analavad upa\u015bama,\u201d\u00b2 which is the well-known expression for the Buddhist Nirv\u0101\u1e47a.\n\n**Sound (p. 98)**\n\nSound (\u015babda) is here treated like the other four attributes, colour, etc. In V.S. \u015babda has three meanings, but in this passage it relates to the first sort. Pr. Bh. divides it into two sorts, var\u1e47a-lak\u1e63a\u1e47a and dhvani-lak\u1e63a\u1e47a (= avar\u1e47a-lak\u1e63a\u1e47a), and calls it \u201cmomentary (k\u1e63a\u1e47ika), like all the attributes of self.\u201d\u00b3\n\nV.S. states that sound is not an attribute of things which possess touch, nor of self, nor of mind, but is the mark of the existence of ether, and is perceived by the ear (\u015brotra-graha\u1e47a); it is an attribute. Though the author of V.S. clearly states that sound is an attribute, he does not enumerate it among the seventeen attributes, because sound has a special quality, which will be described in the notes on ch. ii.\n\n**Section 4.\u2014Action (pp. 98\u20139)**\n\nThe definition of action has been quoted in the notes on ch. i, 1, 1. V.S. says further that action is the common cause of conjunction, disjunction, and impetus (1, 1, 20), but it can never be the cause of substances and actions (1, 1, 21; 1, 1, 31), nor the effect of actions (1, 1, 24; 1, 1, 31). Pr. Bh. explains it in detail and calls it momentary (k\u1e63a\u1e47ika).\u2074\n\n\u00b9 5, 2, 16, \u201ctad-an\u0101rambha \u0101tm\u0101-sthe manasi \u015bar\u012brasya du\u1e25kha-abh\u0101vah sa yogah.\u201d\n\u00b2 p. 282.\n\u00b3 pp. 287\u20138.\n\u2074 pp. 11, 290 ff.\nThe Action throwing upwards (p. 99)\n\nIn the Chinese translation the action throwing upwards is literally \"the action taking off, or separating\", and does not clearly represent utk\u1e63epa\u1e47a. The express meaning of the definition is that this sort of action is the cause of separation of a thing, formerly conjoined with a certain place, from that place. The author or the Chinese translator understood it by \"taking up something with the hands\".\n\nV.S. says that the action throwing upwards is the effect of gravity, effort, and impression,\u00b9 and casting upward (udasana) results from a particular impulsion.\u00b2 Effort is an essential factor in the action throwing upwards.\n\nPr. Bh. clearly defines it \"\u015bar\u012bra-avayavesu tat-sambandhe\u1e63u ca yad \u016brdhv\u0101-bh\u0101gabhil prade\u015bai\u1e25 sa\u1e41yoga-k\u0101ra\u1e47am adho-bh\u0101gabh\u012b ca prade\u015bai\u1e25 vibh\u0101ga-k\u0101ra\u1e47am karma-upadyate gurutva-prayatna-sa\u1e41yogebhyas tad utk\u1e63epanam\".\u00b3\n\nThe Action throwing downwards (p. 99)\n\nThe action throwing downwards is also literally \"the action throwing off, or conjoining\", which does not distinctly represent avak\u1e63epa\u1e47a. Things, being thrown off by the hands, conjoin with their former place. This sort of action is contrary to the first sort;\u2074 but the definition is not accurate, so that \"the action taking off\" sometimes corresponds to avak\u1e63epa\u1e47a and \"the action throwing off\" to utk\u1e63epa\u1e47a. But the two sorts of action,\n\n\u00b9 1, 1, 29; cf. 5, 1, 1\u20136.\n\u00b2 5, 1, 10.\n\u00b3 p. 291, \"The action throwing upwards is that which brings about the conjunction of the parts of body, and things in contact with these parts, with points of space above them, and also the disjunction of these from those below them; this action is produced by gravity, effort, and conjunction.\"\n\u2074 Cf. Pr. Bh., \"tad-vipar\u012bta-sa\u1e41yoga-vibh\u0101ga-k\u0101ra\u1e47am karma-avak\u1e63epanam\" (p. 291).\ntogether with the action going, are distinguished from the following two sorts on account of residing in atoms. \"Etc.\" in both definitions includes binary atomic compounds, etc., and other corporeal substances.\n\nV.S. says that falling (patana) results from gravity, when conjunction or impression is absent.\\(^1\\) But this falling is not exactly the same action as avak\u1e63epa\u1e47a, which is not specially explained in V.S. and Pr. Bh.\n\nThe Actions contracting, expanding, and going.(p. 99)\n\nThe actions contracting (\u0101ku\u00f1can\u0101) and expanding (pras\u0101ra\u1e47a) are understood when we contract and expand the hands. \"A thing (regarded as) fixed in the near end, or thing connected at the near end\" presupposes large and long substances, i.e. substances from ternary atomic compounds upwards. Accordingly, these actions do not take place in atoms and binary atomic compounds.\n\nBy applying these actions to trees, etc., inertia is explained. Elasticity (sthiti-sth\u0101paka) in Pr. Bh. is one of the causes of these actions.\n\nV.S. does not distinctly mention these actions, but Pr. Bh. defines them, \"rjuno dravyasya-agra-avayav\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 tad-de\u015bair vibh\u0101ga\u1e25 sa\u1e41yoga\u015b ca m\u016bla-prade\u015bair yena karma\u1e47\u0101-avayav\u012b kutilah sa\u1e41j\u0101yate tad \u0101ku\u00f1canai\u1e25,\"\\(^2\\) and \"tad-viparyayena sa\u1e41yoga-vibh\u0101ga-utpattau yena karma\u1e47\u0101-avayav\u012b rjuh sampadyate tat pras\u0101ra\u1e47ai\u1e25\".\n\nAs for the action going (gamana), Kwh\u0113i-ci remarks that \"the action 'going is the cause of the conjoining and disjoining (in succession) of corporeal substances\". The action going resides in atoms and other large and long substances as well.\n\n\\(^1\\) 5, 1, 7; 5, 1, 18 f.; 5, 1, 8 f.\n\n\\(^2\\) pp. 291-2, \"The action contracting is the action by which a straight substance becomes curved by reason of its particles at the further end becoming disjoined from that place and coming in contact with the place near the base,\" and \"the action expanding is the action whereby the substance becomes straightened by reason of the bringing about of conjunction, disjunction in directions opposed to the aforesaid\".\nV.S. says that upward or sideward motion (urdhva- or tiryag-gamana) results from a particular impulsion, which is produced by a particular effort; but Pr. Bh. clearly defines it \"yad aniyata-dik-prade\u015ba-samyoga-vibh\u0101ga-k\u0101ra\u1e47\u0101\u1e41 tad gaman\u0101\u1e41\".2\n\nV.S. explains the actions in bodies and their members, and in things in nature;3 this part of the s\u016btra exhibits a characteristic of the system as a natural philosophy of ancient India. Pr. Bh. also explains sat-pratyaya-, asat-pratyaya-, and apratyaya-karma,4 and generally agrees with V.S. Some of these explanations are stated in the treatise (ch. ii, 3).\n\nThe above three categories in dependence upon one another explain all objects as they actually are. The three categories have two aspects, as principles of classification and as principles of analytical observation. In the latter aspect they are further analysed into causes and effects, and into eternal and non-eternal, except actions, which are always non-eternal, while in the former aspect they are the names of the three classes of things, and include things in all the states, causes, and effects, etc.; consequently, they are characterized as follows: \"existence, non-eternity, inhesion in substance, effect, cause, and possession of universality and particularity are the common (characteristics) of substances, attributes, and actions.\"5\n\nSections 5\u20136.\u2014Universality and Particularity (pp. 99\u2013100)\n\nV.S. says, \"s\u0101m\u0101nya-vi\u1e63e\u1e63a iti buddhy-apek\u1e63\u0101\u1e41.\"6 Buddhy-apek\u1e63a has not the idealistic meaning in the\n\n1 5, 1, 8\u201310.\n2 p. 292, \"The action going is that which is the cause of conjunctions and disjunctions with and from points of space in any direction.\"\n3 5, 1, 1\u20135, 2, 21.\n4 pp. 297\u2013309.\n5 1, 1, 8, \"sad anityai\u1e25 dravyavat k\u0101ryai\u1e25 k\u0101ra\u1e47ai\u1e25 s\u0101m\u0101nya-vi\u1e63e\u1e63avat iti dravya-guna-karman\u0101\u1e41 avi\u1e63e\u1e63ah.\" Cf. R\u00f6er, Vai\u015be\u1e63ika s\u016btra, ZDMG., vol. xxii, p. 320.\n6 1, 2, 3, \"Universality and particularity both depend upon intellection.\"\nepistemological sense, that is, universality and particularity are not, as some idealists hold, the mere forms of idea, but they each have reality, like the other categories. The meaning of the s\u016btra is that universality and particularity are relative and not absolute. For instance, substance-ness, attribute-ness, action-ness, earth-ness, colour-ness, throwing-upwards-ness, pot-ness, and so on, are sometimes included in universality and sometimes in particularity. The highest universality is existence and only one, while the lowest particularity is the ultimate particulars (or the final species) and more than one.\\(^1\\) The former corresponds to the \"category\" in the classification of concepts in logic, and the latter to individual or single concepts. There are many relative universalities and particularities, which correspond to genera and species, intervening between the two extremes.\n\nPr. Bh., as stated in the Introduction, divides universality into two sorts, the highest universality and the lower universality. The former contains existence only, while the latter includes relative universalities and particularities, that is, substance-ness down to pot-ness. The highest universality is universality proper, and the lower is sometimes called particularity.\\(^2\\)\n\nParticularity is \"nitya-dravya-v\u1e5bttayo 'nty\u0101 vi\u015be\u1e63\u0101\u1e25 (the ultimate particularities which exist in the eternal substances)\", and includes atoms, ether, time, space, self, and mind.\n\n\"Universality\" in the treatise is exactly the same as the highest universality in Pr. Bh., sometimes simply called existence. In ch. ii the term universality is omitted and existence is used. Consequently, the word excludes the lower universality, which is a distinct category, called in the treatise universality-particularity (= common-ness).\n\n\\(^1\\) 1, 2, 4\u20137.\n\n\\(^2\\) pp. 11, 311. V.S. 1, 2, 4, \"bh\u0101vo 'nuv\u1e5btter eva hetutv\u0101t s\u0101m\u0101nyam eva.\" S\u0101m\u0101nyam eva might have been understood as s\u0101m\u0101nya proper, or itself.\nUniversality is the common cause of the recognitions with respect to the first three categories that they are existent. \"Perceived by all the sense-organs\" exactly agrees with V.S. 4, 1, 13\\(^1\\) and Pr. Bh. p. 187.\n\nThe historical development of universality and particularity has been discussed. In Chinese translations the lower universality is not classified under universality. If the categories are only six and universality is really the highest universality, the lower universality is naturally a part of particularity. Consequently, particularity is called universality-particularity. On the other hand, if universality is confined to existence only, particularity also claims to be confined to the ultimate particulars. Hence the lower universality has no place in the two categories, so that it must have a distinct category.\n\n\"Particularity\" in the treatise exactly corresponds to the particularity in Pr. Bh. \"Which exists in substances only\" is literally \"which always exists in substances\" and is parallel to nitya-dravya-v\u1e5btti; but in Chinese it is not at all possible to read \"which exists in the eternal substances\". Consequently, the definition may suggest at first sight that the category particularity in the treatise includes all substances whatsoever; but ch. ii (1, 2) asserts that one of the common characteristics of the nine substances, as causes, is that they each have particularity. Particularity exists, therefore, in atoms, ether, time, space, self, and mind. Each of the four atoms is plural in number, so that particularity is innumerable.\n\n\u015aiv\u0101ditya in his Saptapad\u0101rth\u012b says, \"vi\u015be\u1e63as tu y\u0101van-nitya-dravya-v\u1e5bttitv\u0101d anant\u0101 eva.\"\\(^2\\)\n\n\"The cause of the intellective of excluding others and determining the one\"\\(^3\\) is explained by Kwh\u0113i-ci: \"the\n\n\\(^1\\) 4,1,13, \"etena gunatve bh\u0101ve casarva-indriyam j\u00f1\u0101nam vy\u0101khy\u0101tam.\"\n\n\\(^2\\) p. 12.

The other details will be stated in the notes on ch. i, 10.\n\nSection 7.\u2014Inherence (p. 100)\n\nV.S. defines inherence (samav\u0101ya) \u201ciha-idam iti yata\u1e25 k\u0101rya-k\u0101ra\u1e47ay\u014d\u1e25 sa samav\u0101y\u0101\u1e25\u201d,\u00b9 and, again, \u201cni\u1e63kriy\u0101\u1e47\u0101\u1e41 samav\u0101y\u0101\u1e25 karmabhyo ni\u1e63iddha\u1e25\u201d.\u00b2\n\nPr.

This definition has a relation to V.S. \u201cyuta-siddhy-abh\u0101v\u0101t k\u0101rya-k\u0101ra\u1e47ay\u014d\u1e25 sa\u1e41yoga-vibh\u0101gau na vidyete\u201d.\u2074 K\u0101rya-k\u0101ra\u1e47ay\u014d\u1e25 in V.S. (7, 2, 26) principally refers to the spatial causality between substances and their attributes and actions, and is replaced by \u201cayuta-siddh\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 \u0101dh\u0101ry-\u0101dh\u0101ra-bh\u016bt\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 sa\u1e41bandhe\u201d in Pr. Bh.\n\nThe definition in the treatise comes from Pr. Bh. \u201cSubstances, etc.\u201d includes, according to Pr. Bh.,\u2075 attributes, actions, universality, and particularity; but in the treatise it includes the eight categories other than inherence itself and the tenth category non-existence. \u201cWith respect to the inseparable connexion\u201d corresponds to \u201cayuta-siddh\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 . . . sa\u1e41bandhe\u201d. \u201cIts reality is\n\n\u00b9 7, 2, 26, \u201cThat is inherence by virtue of which it may be said of cause and effect that the one is in the other.\u201d\n\u00b2 5, 2, 23, \u201cThe inherence of things inactive (i.e. attributes and actions) is excluded from actions.\u201d\n\u00b3 pp. 12, 324, \u201cInherence is the cause of the notion (that the one) is here (in the other) in the relationship subsisting among things that are inseparable, standing to one another in the character of the container and the contained.\u201d\n\u2074 7, 2, 13, \u201cInasmuch as there is non-existence of unconnectedness, there is no conjunction and disjunction of an effect and its cause.\u201d\n\u2075 p. 324.\none\u201d has the same meaning as V.S. \u201ctattva\u1e41 bh\u0101vena\u201d\u00b9 and as Pr. Bh. \u201cna ca sa\u1e41yogavan n\u0101n\u0101tv\u0101\u1e41 bh\u0101vaval li\u1e45ga-avi\u015be\u1e63\u0101d vi\u015be\u1e63a-li\u1e45ga-abh\u0101v\u0101c ca tasm\u0101d bh\u0101vavat sarvatra-ek\u0101\u1e25 samav\u0101ya iti\u201d.\u00b2\n\nAccording to the commentators\u2019 reading the definition is to be translated by \u201cthe category inherence is that which makes substances, etc., inseparable and connected, and the cause of the recognition (with respect to them) that (the one) is here (in the other)\u201d. Kwh\u0113i-ci explains that \u201cit makes substances, attributes, and actions inseparable and connected with one another\u201d; and the commentators explain that \u201cit makes separated things inseparable and connected\u201d, or, strangely, \u201cit makes substances inseparable and connected, so that substances produce effects.\u201d\n\nInherence consists in ayuta-siddha-bh\u016btatva and can never make separated things inseparable and connected with one another; that is to say, the inseparable connexion in things is not produced anew by inherence, and inherence has no productiveness at all, but is the intimate connexion in the inseparably connected things. If the definition should be understood as the commentators explain it, the idea of inherence in the treatise would be quite different from V.S. and Pr. Bh., and would not be consistent with the general mode of thinking in the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika. And inherence would not be distinguished from conjunction, so that it would not be a distinct category.\n\nThe Vai\u015be\u1e63ika classifies objects and analyses them into effects and causes, the latter of which are eternal and not produced from others.\u00b3 Even in substances as causes there are attributes and actions residing. If these causes could be produced from certain final causes, which\n\n\u00b9 7, 2, 28, \u201cIts reality (is explained) by existence\u201d (see 1, 2, 17).\n\u00b2 p. 326, \u201cInherence has no diversity such as conjunction has, and because of the non-particularity of the mark and of the non-existence of a particular mark therein like existence there is only one in every place, as in the case of existence\u201d (see V.S. 1, 2, 17).\n\u00b3 V.S. 4, 1, 1, \u201csad ak\u0101ra\u1e47av\u0101n nityam.\u201d\nhave no attributes and actions, they would be made inseparable and connected by the force of inherence with other substances, attributes, and actions in the course of being produced. But inherence is eternal and always resides in substances. Besides, inherence, like the other categories, originally came from the conceptual analysis of things, and was considered, from the realistic standpoint of the system, as really existing in the objective world. Therefore, inherence, like the other categories, has its origin in abstraction, and has not existence before substances, however independent it is of the latter.\n\nConsequently, the commentators' reading must be understood as follows: \"That substances, etc., are inseparable and connected with one another is possible by virtue of inherence, or that substances, etc., are inseparable and connected is nothing but inherence.\"\n\nSections 8\u20139.\u2014Potentiality and Non-potentiality (p. 100)\n\nAccording to V.S. the first three categories have productive faculties, although attributes and actions are inactive.\n\n(1) One substance originates a substance, attributes, actions, and substances, and (2) many substances originate another substance of the same class.\\(^1\\) (3) One attribute originates substances, attributes, and actions, and (4) many attributes also originate substances, attributes, and actions.\\(^2\\) And (5) one action originates attributes, and (6) many actions originate attributes\\(^3\\); but action never originates any substance or any action.\n\nIn the definition of the treatise \u015bakti (potentiality) is rendered by \"having potentiality or faculty\"; but the text of the Bodleian Library has \"potentiality\" in ch. i, 1. This is a better translation, because \"having\n\n\\(^1\\) 1, 1, 9\u201310; 1, 1, 23; 1, 1, 18; 1, 1, 25.\n\\(^2\\) 1, 1, 9\u201310; 1, 1, 27\u20139; 1, 1, 19.\n\\(^3\\) 1, 1, 30; 1, 1, 20. Cf. 1, 1, 11; 1, 1, 21\u20132; 1, 1, 24; 1, 1, 26; 1, 1, 31.\npotentiality\u201d might seem to suggest that the original Sanskrit may have been sa-\u015bakti or something like that. But even that text has \u201chaving potentiality\u201d in all other passages, and the texts of the other editions always have \u201chaving potentiality\u201d. \u201cHaving\u201d is added so as to use two characters, in order to make a parallel to the next category \u201cnon-potentiality\u201d. \u201cHaving potentiality\u201d has, of course, the same meaning as \u201cpotentiality\u201d.\n\n\u201cCo-operatively\u201d in the definition means both \u201cco-operatively among substances, or among attributes, or among actions\u201d and \u201cco-operatively among substances, attributes, and actions\u201d. The former case can easily be understood from the above summary (2, 4, 6) of V.S. However inactive attributes and actions are in their nature, they always reside in substances. In this sense they are regarded as co-operative with substances.\n\n\u201cIndependently\u201d is literally \u201cwithout becoming one\u201d, and Kwh\u0113i-ci explains it as \u201cseparately\u201d and \u201cnot co-operatively\u201d. This is the case in 1, 3, and 5.\n\nThat the author uses the expressions \u201cco-operatively\u201d and \u201cindependently\u201d evidently shows that he has thought out the category directly from V.S. Therefore he seems not to have been influenced by the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e41sakas.\n\nNon-potentiality is not mentioned in other works. It is the negative or excluding aspect of potentiality. The inclusion of the category has been suggested probably by particularity or the ultimate particulars and non-existence. Particularity or the ultimate particulars are in some points the excluding aspect of universality. And non-existence is the negative side of existence. They relate to the first three categories. Potentiality and non-potentiality also relate to the three categories. Non-potentiality has just the same relation to potentiality as non-existence to existence.\n\nKwh\u0113i-ci remarks, \u201cif there is no such category as non-potentiality (in the case of production), one thing\nmay originate one and all effects; but by virtue of the category everything productive originates its own effects and is prevented from originating the effects of others.\"\n\nSection 10.\u2014Commonness (pp. 100\u20131)\n\nCommonness (universality-particularity) is here rendered in Chinese \"common-difference\". The Chinese translator usually translates s\u0101m\u0101nya by \"universality or generality\", and vi\u015be\u1e63a by \"particularity\", so that \"common-difference\" seems at the first sight the translation of other words; but the translator uses the term universality-particularity as the translation of s\u0101m\u0101nya-vi\u015be\u1e63a in ch. ii, 10. And Kwh\u0113i-ci asserts that the category commonness is the same as the (fifth) category s\u0101m\u0101nya-vi\u015be\u1e63a acknowledged by former teachers. The assertion is not strictly correct; but it shows that the Sanskrit equivalent of \"common-difference\" is s\u0101m\u0101nya-vi\u015be\u1e63a.\n\nCommonness, as a consequence of the historical development, corresponds to V.S. \"dravyatva\u1e41 gu\u1e47atva\u1e41 karmatva\u1e41 ca s\u0101m\u0101ny\u0101ni vi\u015be\u1e63\u0101\u015b ca\",\u00b9 and to the lower universality in Pr. Bh. Pr. Bh. says, \"aparam dravyatva-gu\u1e47atva-karmatva-\u0101di (i.e. prthiv\u012btv\u0101-r\u016bpatva-utk\u1e63e-pa\u00f1atva-gotva-gha\u1e6datva-pa\u1e6datva-\u0101di) anuv\u1e5btti-vy\u0101v\u1e5btti-hetutv\u0101t s\u0101m\u0101ny\u0101ni vi\u015be\u1e63\u0101\u015b ca bhavati.\"\u00b2\n\nKwh\u0113i-ci explains, \"commonnesses are the essences of substances, attributes, and actions (i.e. commonnesses are substance-ness, attribute-ness, and action-ness). They are the general commonnesses in the three categories. Earth-ness, colour-ness, and so on are the particular commonnesses. Commonness does not exist in the other categories (i.e. universality, particularity, inherence,\n\n\u00b9 1, 2, 5, \"Substance-ness, attribute-ness, and action-ness are universalities and particularities.\"\n\u00b2 p. 311, \"The lower universality is substance-ness, attribute-ness, action-ness, etc. (i.e. earth-ness, colour-ness, throwing-upwards-ness, cow-ness, pot-ness, cloth-ness, etc.), and is regarded as universality as well as particularity, inasmuch as it is the cause of inclusion as well as exclusion.\"\npotentiality, and non-potentiality, except naturally non-existence and commonness). It is perceived by all the sense-organs. Commonness is the same as the (fifth) category, universality-particularity, acknowledged by former teachers. It is named commonness, because it denotes that a thing is, on the one hand, common to, and on the other hand, particular in distinction from, another.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is perceived by all the sense-organs\u201d is not accurate, as stated later on.\n\nAs for the (fifth) category, universality-particularity, we have Kwh\u0113i-ci\u2019s explanation in his commentary on No. 1216.\\(^1\\)\n\n\u201cKa\u1e47\u0101da then proceeded to explain the category universality-particularity. It is that which makes substances, attributes, and actions general and particular. These three categories have each one universality-particularity common to their respective members (i.e. the universality-particularity of substances, which is substance-ness, is common to all the substances; but it is particular in distinction from attributes and actions, and so on). And every member contained in these three categories has the special universality-particularity (that is, the universality-particularity of earth, which is earth-ness, is not common to the other substances, water, etc., but it is common to all the members contained in earth, and so on). Thus, there are, further, the common and the special universalities-particularities among all things contained in the three categories (that is, cow-ness, pot-ness, atom-ness, etc.).\u201d The category universality-particularity, being the fifth of the six categories, naturally includes the ultimate particulars. If the ultimate particulars are put aside, the category is exactly the same as the ninth category.\n\nKwh\u0113i-ci, explaining the fifth category particularity in the treatise, says, \u201cparticularity is manifold, because it\n\n\\(^1\\) Dainihon-zoku-z\u014dky\u014d, 86, bk. 4, p. 388b.\nresides in the nine substances. Its numbers are indefinite, because there are the common particularity possessed by all the substances (or the particularities commonly possessed by each of the substances), and many of the special particularities possessed by every substance. The nine substances have each their differentiations.\"\n\n\"The common particularity\" means substance-ness (or the particularities mean earth-ness, mind-ness, etc.); and \"the special particularities\" earth-ness, atom-ness, cow-ness, pot-ness, etc. The explanation seems to be confused with the ninth category.\n\nAs to substance-ness Pr. Bh. says, \"dravyatv\u0101m paraspara-vi\u015bi\u1e63\u1e6de\u1e63u prthivy-\u0101di\u1e63v-anuv\u1e5btti-hetutv\u0101t s\u0101m\u0101nya\u1e41, gu\u1e47a-karmabhyo vy\u0101v\u1e5btti-hetutv\u0101t vi\u015be\u1e63a\u1e25.\" Attribute-ness and action-ness are similarly defined.\\(^1\\) Earth-ness, etc., are stated as \"prthivitva-r\u016bpatva-utk\u1e63epan\u0101tva-gotvagha\u1e6datva-pa\u1e6datva-\u0101din\u0101m api pr\u0101\u1e47y-apr\u0101\u1e47i-gat\u0101n\u0101m anuv\u1e5btti-vy\u0101v\u1e5btti-hetutv\u0101t s\u0101m\u0101nya-vi\u015be\u1e63a-bh\u0101vali siddhal\u012b.\" \\(^1\\) V.S. does not distinctly state them.\n\nPerceptibility of substance-ness, etc., is stated in V.S. as \"etena gunatve bh\u0101ve ca sarva-indriyam j\u00f1\u0101nam vy\u0101khy\u0101tam\"\\(^2\\); and Pr. Bh. says, \"bh\u0101va-dravyatva-gunatvakarmatv\u0101din\u0101m upalabdhy-\u0101dh\u0101ra-samavet\u0101n\u0101in \u0101\u015braya-gr\u0101hakair indriyair grahan\u0101m.\"\\(^3\\) That substance-ness and action-ness are perceived by the eyes and the touch-organ can be inferred, because the objects of the other three organs are excluded from substance-ness and action-ness.\n\n\\(^1\\) p. 311, \"Substance-ness is universality, inasmuch as it is the cause of the inclusion with respect to such mutually different things as earth, etc., and it is particularity, inasmuch as it is the cause of the exclusion of attributes and actions.\" \"Earth-ness, colour-ness, throwing-upwards-ness, cow-ness, pot-ness, cloth-ness, etc., that inhere in animate and inanimate things, are also established as universalities and particularities inasmuch as they are the causes of inclusion and exclusion.\"\n\n\\(^2\\) 4, 1, 13; 4, 1, 6\u201312.\n\n\\(^3\\) p. 187, \"Existence, substance-ness, attribute-ness, action-ness, etc., which are inherent in the receptacles of presentation, i.e. substances, are perceived by means of these sense-organs that perceive their substrata.\"\n\"Substance-ness,\" \"earth-ness,\" \"pot-ness,\" and so on mean the objective realities substance, earth, pot, and so on, corresponding to the concepts substance, earth, pot, and so on. The system maintains that there are necessarily entities in the objective world corresponding to the concepts; this dogma comes from the realistic standpoint of the system. Even category-ness (pad\u0101rthatva) is used in the system. See Roha-gutta's explanation of s\u0101m\u0101nya (p. 35).\n\nSection 11.\u2014Non-existence (p. 101)\n\n\"Asat (= abh\u0101va, non-existence)\" is mentioned in V.S. 9, 1, 1\u201310. Whether the author of V.S. regards asat as a category or not can be judged from the context. The first section (\u0101hnika) of the eighth chapter (adhy\u0101ya) explains the first stage of laukika-pratyak\u1e63a, the second section mentions its second stage, then come the s\u016btras 9, 1, 1\u201310 (asat), and the remaining part, 11\u201315, explains alaukika-pratyak\u1e63a. The second section of the ninth chapter expounds la\u1e45gika and \u0101rsa-siddha-dar\u015bana, etc. It is hardly doubtful that the author does not regard asat as a category, nor an entity, but asat is only a form or principle of recognition.\n\nThe author of our treatise acknowledges non-existence as a category, as an entity. The positing of the category has probably been suggested by the fourth category. If that fourth category, universality, is restricted to existence, which relates to the three categories, the establishment of its negative complement is perhaps natural.\n\nNon-existence is usually divided into four sorts, but the treatise has five sorts.\n\n\"Antecedent non-existence\" is literally \"not-yet-produced non-existence\", and is the translation of pr\u0101g-abh\u0101va or -asat. V.S. says, \"kriy\u0101-gu\u1e47a-vyapade\u015ba-abh\u0101v\u0101t pr\u0101g-asat.\"\u00b9 Kriy\u0101-gu\u1e47a originally refers to a substance,\n\n\u00b9 9, 1, 1. \"(An effect) is antecedently non-existent, inasmuch as there is non-existence of assertion of actions and attributes\" (see 9, 1, 7).\nand then to its attributes and actions. \"The cause and accessories\" means the producing substances, potentiality and non-potentiality.\n\n\"Subsequent non-existence\" (pradhvamsa- or dhvamsa-, abh\u0101va, or -asat) is literally \"already-destroyed non-existence\". This non-existence is explained in V.S. 9, 1, 2\u20133 and 9, 1, 6. \"After the force of their causes had been exhausted or the accessories for their overthrow had been produced\" relates to potentiality and non-potentiality.\n\nReciprocal non-existence (anyonya-abh\u0101va or -asat) and absolute non-existence (atyanta-abh\u0101va or -asat) are explained in V.S. 9, 1, 4; 9, 1, 8 and 9, 1, 5; 9, 1, 9. \"Etc.\" includes attributes, etc.\n\nNatural non-existence is literally \"unassociated non-existence\". This non-existence is, in the treatise, of two sorts, eternal and non-eternal. Chapter ii (10, 1) explains them as follows:\n\n\"In what case is natural non-existence eternal?\n\nThe substances, earth, etc., are not in the inherent relation to other attributes (than their own). Universality-particularity (i.e. common-ness), like substance-ness, etc., potentiality, non-potentiality, and particularity, does not inhere in substrata other than its own (respective one).\n\nExistence does not exist in universality, etc.\n\nIn what case is natural non-existence non-eternal?\n\nThere is the case where a substance does not conjoin with other substances, but will certainly conjoin with them afterwards. (Before the conjunction takes place) the former does not exist in the latter.\n\nOr, before a substance comes to conjoin with another substance and makes the attributes and actions thereof inherent in itself, the latter do not exist in the former.\"\n\nThe former case is hardly different from reciprocal (and absolute) non-existence, while the latter is nothing but antecedent non-existence. Subsequent non-existence\ncannot be included in the latter case, because subsequent non-existence, together with reciprocal and absolute non-existence is, according to the treatise, eternal; but it cannot possibly be included in the former case, as the name itself opposes. Hence the five non-existences may be classified into two sorts, natural and subsequent non-existence. But in both cases the division is a cross division. The fact evidently shows that the enumeration of this natural non-existence came from V.S. \"n\u0101sti gha\u1e6do gele iti sato gha\u1e6dasya geha-sa\u1e41sarga-prati\u1e63edhah.\" Therefore, the author derived the first four non-existences from s\u016btras 9, 1, 1\u20139, and the fifth from 9, 1, 10.\n\nNatural non-existence corresponds to sa\u1e41sarga-prati\u1e63edha, and the original Sanskrit seems to have been sa\u1e41sarga-abh\u0101va or -asat, or sa\u1e41sarga-prati\u1e63edha-abh\u0101va or -asat. In V.S. sa\u1e41sarga-prati\u1e63edha relates to a pot and a house, that is, to substances as effects; but the treatise applies it to the categories. Cf. Ny\u0101ya-k\u014d\u015ba, pp. 857\u20138, V.S. 1, 2, 1\u20132.\n\n1 9, 1, 10, \"(The proposition) that there is not a water-pot in a house is a negation of connexion between an existent water-pot and the house.\"\n\nBut the Siddh\u0101nta-mukt\u0101val\u012b (pp. 33\u20134) and the Turka-kaumud\u012b (p. 19) divide non-existence into two sorts, anyonya-abh\u0101va and sa\u1e41sarga-abh\u0101va. The latter contains pr\u0101g-abh\u0101va, pradhvamsa-abh\u0101va, and atyanta-abh\u0101va.\nChapter II\n\nSection 1.\u2014Substance (pp. 102\u20135)\n\n1. Substances Active and Inactive (p. 102)\n\nV.S. says, \"dik-k\u0101l\u0101v \u0101k\u0101\u015ba\u1e47 ca kriy\u0101vad-vaidharmy\u0101n niskriy\u0101ni\";\u00b9 but Pr. Bh. mentions that earth, water, fire, wind, and mind are only active (kriy\u0101vat).\u00b2 The author of the treatise follows the latter. The Upask\u0101ra, the Viv\u1e5bti, and even the Candra-k\u0101nta-bh\u0101\u1e63ya\u00b3 accept the opinion and consider that the s\u016btra implies the addition of self. This opinion seems not to be correct.\n\nV.S. states, \"\u0101tma-samyoga-prayatn\u0101bhya\u1e41 haste karma,\" \"\u0101tma-karma hasta-samyog\u0101c ca,\" and \"\u0101tmakarmasu mok\u1e63o vy\u0101khy\u0101t\u0101\u1e25.\"\u2074\n\nThe Upask\u0101ra explains the first s\u016btra, \"Action in the hand as its inherent cause is by means of conjunction with self, and of effort of self. Of this action the non-inherent cause is conjunction with self possessing effort. Effort is the efficient cause.\"\u2075 The second s\u016btra is explained thus: \"The term self tropically signifies a portion of the body. The action then of the self, that is, of a member of the body, that is, of the hand, results from conjunction of\n\n\u00b9 5, 2, 21, \"Space and time, together with ether, are inactive, being dissimilar to that which possesses action.\"\n\u00b2 p. 21.\n\u00b3 But it remarks, \"\u0101tm\u0101 tu tath\u0101-bh\u016bto 'pi manas\u0101 sam\u0101sajyam\u0101nah kriy\u0101v\u0101n iva bhavati vyavah\u0101ra-bh\u016bm\u0101v iti.\"\n\u2074 5, 1, 1, \"Action in the hand is by means of conjunction with, and effort of, self\"; 5, 1, 6, \"Action of self is also from conjunction with the hand,\" and 6, 2, 16, \"Emancipation is declared as dependent on the actions of self.\"\n\u2075 Gough's translation, a little modified. \"\u0101tm\u0101n\u0101\u1e25 samyoga-prayatnau t\u0101bhya\u1e41 haste samav\u0101yi-k\u0101ra\u1e47e karma tasya ca karman\u0101\u1e25 prayatnavad-\u0101tm\u0101-saniyogo 'samav\u0101yi-k\u0101ra\u1e47am prayatna\u015b ca nimitta-k\u0101ra\u1e47\u0101m.\" But nimitta-k\u0101ra\u1e47a is not mentioned in V.S., therefore the explanation must be as follows: \"Action in the hand has the hand as its samav\u0101yi-k\u0101ra\u1e47a, and conjunction with, and effort of, self as its asamav\u0101yi-k\u0101ra\u1e47a.\" \"Conjunction with self possessing effort\" is not the correct explanation.\nthe hand and pestle. The word 'and (ca)' implies also impetus. In the action of the hand conjunction with the hand is the non-inherent cause. This conjunction is at some times conjunction with self possessing effort, at other times conjunction with pestle possessed of impetus.\"\u00b9\n\nAccording to this explanation \u0101tma-karma hasta-samyog\u0101c ca is replaced by haste karma (or hasta-karma) hasta-samyog\u0101c ca. But the action in the hand has, as the first s\u016btra asserts, its non-inherent cause in conjunction with, and effort of, self, and hasta-samyoga must, on the analogy of \u0101tma-samy\u014dga, be \"conjunction of the hand with the hand\". If hasta-samyoga is \"conjunction of the hand with a pestle\", the conjunction is the non-inherent cause of the action in the pestle, as s\u016btra 5, 1, 2 and the Upask\u0101ra on it assert, and the inherent cause must be the pestle. But of hasta-karma the hand must be the inherent cause. Therefore, if \u0101tma-karma is haste karma, h\u0101sta-samyog\u0101t cannot be understood. The Upask\u0101ra's explanations are far-fetched. The truth is that the second s\u016btra is the case of the first s\u016btra reversed, and self is naturally the inherent cause of its own action, while its non-inherent cause is the conjunction with the hand. Therefore, self must have, in some cases, action. The Upask\u0101ra's explanation comes from the opinion that self is entirely inactive. Inactivity of ether, time, and space is due to their dissimilarity to the active substances; but self has no such dissimilarity, because the expression \u0101tma-karma denies it. Compare with mind, which is explained in V.S. 5, 2, 14 on the analogy of the hands as being active. If self is entirely inactive, the third s\u016btra cannot be understood. Even the Upask\u0101ra explains this s\u016btra \"when there exist the actions of\n\n\u00b9 \"\u0101tma-\u015babdah \u015bar\u012bra-avayava-para upac\u0101r\u0101t tath\u0101 ca-\u0101tmanah \u015bar\u012bra-avayavasya-api hastasya yat karma tad hasta-musala-samyo\u1e63\u1e6d ca-k\u0101r\u0101c ca vega-samuccay\u0101h hasta-karm\u0101\u1e47i hasta-samyo\u1e63as t\u0101vad asamav\u0101yi-k\u0101ran\u0101m sa ca kvacit prayatnavad-\u0101tma-samyo\u1e63ah kvacid vegavan-musal\u0101di-hasta-samyo\u1e63ah.\"\nself, emancipation ensues.\" Besides, the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika's characteristic doctrine is the Kriy\u0101-v\u0101da, differing from the S\u0101\u1e41khya, the Ved\u0101nta, and other systems. The Kriy\u0101-v\u0101da means the doctrine which holds that self is active, or self is affected by pleasure or desire, etc. Bh\u0101va-viveka in his Praj\u00f1\u0101-d\u012bpa-s\u016btra states that the self of the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika is called k\u0101r\u1e6dya (an agent).\n\nOn the other hand, if \"the dissimilarity to the active substances\" means \"the incorporeality of space, etc., for action resides only in the corporeal\", as the Upask\u0101ra maintains, the activity of self must be rejected, as in the case of attributes and actions. The commentators accept this consequence. If so, the meaning of the Kriy\u0101-v\u0101da is to be restricted to \"self is not active, but it is affected by the attributes and the actions\". This is also not correct.\n\nThe definition of substances is that substances possess actions and attributes, and are inherent causes. But possessing actions and attributes has almost the same meaning as being inherent causes, because inherent cause means the substratum of both attributes and actions, or of either attributes or actions. The characteristic of ether, time, and space, consists in being the inherent causes of attributes, while the five corporeal substances, the four atoms and mind, are the inherent causes of both attributes and actions. But the first action of atoms and mind comes from ad\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da, and mind has no activity when yoga is practised. Accordingly, even the five substances are not necessarily active. Again, Pr. Bh. distinctly states that ad\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da has no activity (v\u1e5btti) during the time of the\n\n1 \"\u0101tma-karmasu satsu mok\u1e63o bhavati.\"\n2 SBE, vol. xlv, p. xxxv.\n3 No. 1185, p. 110b, cf. N.S. 3, 1, 6. Dharma-p\u0101la states that self in absolute emancipation is not active any more.\n4 The Upask\u0101ra on 5, 2, 21 says, \"kriy\u0101vat\u0101\u1e41 vaidharmya\u1e41 dig-\u0101din\u0101m am\u016brtatv\u0101\u1e41 m\u016brti-anuvidh\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 kriy\u0101y\u0101\u1e25.\"\n5 5, 2, 22.\n6 5, 2, 13; 5, 2, 16.\nworld's dissolution. The substances have naturally no activity during that time. Therefore, the necessary condition common to all the substances is solely that of being inherent causes of attributes. The distinction between space, etc., and the five corporeal substances is that the latter have capability of actions, while the former have it not. \"The dissimilarity of space, etc., to the active substances\" cannot logically mean the incorporeality of space, etc.\n\nIt is evident from what has been said that in the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika the first and only source of actions is ad\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da. What then is ad\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da? Ad\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da is, as explained above, a kind of merit and demerit, and causes the combination of atoms forming the body on the one hand and the world on the other. In the former case the egress and ingress (of mind from and into bodies), etc., are caused by it, and even in daily life the production of desire and aversion, etc., is caused by it. Consequently, ad\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da is the principal hinderer of emancipation. In the latter case particular actions in earth, the circulation in trees, the upward flaming of fire, the sideward blowing of wind, the movement of the gem, and the approach of the needle are caused by it.\n\nPr. Bh. holds that ad\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da is an attribute; but in the strict sense it is not an attribute, because ad\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da is an absolute cause of conjunction. On the other hand, ad\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da is not an action, because it is a cause of actions. V.S. says that inaugurations, fasting, continence, residence in the family of a spiritual guide, life in the forest, sacrifice, almsgiving, oblation, the cardinal points, constellations, sacred texts, seasons, and religious observances conduce to\n\n1 pp. 48-9. If ad\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da be an attribute, it cannot have an action at any time.\n2 5, 2, 17; 6, 2, 12; 5, 2, 18. See 6, 2, 15.\n3 5, 2, 2; 5, 2, 7; 5, 2, 13; 5, 1, 15.\n4 5, 2, 17-18.\nad\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da. From this s\u016btra and as \"the principal hinderer of emancipation\" ad\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da must be regarded as being a kind of quality of self. Pr. Bh. distinctly calls it an attribute of self (sarva-\u0101tma-gata-ad\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da). \u015aa\u1e45kara begins one of his objections against the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika with \"Is this unseen principle to be considered as inhering in the self or in the atom?\"\n\nIf ad\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da, as a certain quality of self, causes the combination of atoms to form the body and the world, all sorts of actions are to be considered as coming from the self. Self, then, is the only cause of actions, as the consequence of what has been stated. Therefore, the self in the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika system cannot be entirely inactive. But the activity of self is principally concerned with the individual self.\n\nAs for the other qualities enumerated in the treatise, Pr. Bh. says that earth, water, fire, wind, self, and mind are manifold (anekatva) and contain lower species (apara-j\u0101timattva). And earth, water, fire, wind, and mind have activity (kriy\u0101vattva), corporeality (m\u016brtatva), priority, posteriority, and impetus.\n\nSelf is on the one hand one and on the other hand manifold. In the latter case it must have priority and posteriority. Time and space have also priority and posteriority, because they have effects. Ether has in V.S. no priority and posteriority at all, but Pr. Bh. and the treatise have special opinions concerning ether.\n\n2. Substances possessing Attributes, etc. (p. 102)\n\nSee the definition of substance. Pr. Bh. enumerates the following qualities as the properties common to all\n\n1 6,2,2, \"Abhi\u1e63ecana-upav\u0101sa-brahmacarya-gurukulav\u0101sa-v\u0101naprastha-yaj\u00f1a-d\u0101na-prok\u1e63a\u1e47a-di\u1e45-nak\u1e63atra-mantra-k\u0101la-niyam\u0101\u015b ca-ad\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101ya.\"\n\n2 Brahma-s\u016btra-bh\u0101sya on 2, 2, 12.\n\n3 \"Urdhvajvalana-tiryakpavan\u0101ny-\u0101tma-vi\u015be\u1e63a-gu\u1e47a-k\u012brt\u0101ni\" (Ny\u0101ya-kandal\u012b, p. 88).\n\n4 p. 21.\n\n5 2, 1, 29\u201331.\nthe nine substances: belonging to substance-ness, giving rise to effects residing in themselves, possessing attributes, being not destroyed by their effects and causes, and possessing ultimate particulars.\\(^1\\)\n\nThe treatise has \"they have each particularity\" instead of *antya-vi\u015be\u1e63avattva*, which is found in the following sub-section 5. \"They are causes which presuppose others\" is not quite clear.

The meaning may be that substances always exist together with other substances and attributes, etc., but never stand alone, or substances cannot produce their effects by themselves; they produce their effects by virtue of potentiality and non-potentiality, and so on, according to the treatise.\n\n3. **Substances possessing Touch, etc.** (p. 102)\n\nSee V.S. 2, 1, 1\u20135 and the treatise, ch. i, 2, 1\u20134. *Pr.

As to invisibility, see V.S. 4, 1, 7; 8, 1, 2; 9, 1, 11\u201315.\n\n5. *Substances Eternal and Non-eternal, etc.* (p. 103)\n\nThe last paragraph requires special attention.\n\nIn the texts of the Bodleian Library and the Library of the India Office, it runs: \u201cThat they inhere in another substance or do not inhere in another (1), consist of parts or do not consist of parts (2), are not destroyed by their causes or are (not not) destroyed by their causes (3), are not ultimate particulars or are ultimate particulars (4), and are not spherical or are spherical (5), is explained as in the case of being eternal and non-eternal.\u201d\n\nThe texts of the commentaries Nos. 9 and 10 have the following order: \u201cThat they do not inhere in another substance or inhere in another (1), do not consist of parts or consist of parts (2), are not destroyed by their causes or are (not not) destroyed by their causes (3), are not ultimate particulars or are ultimate particulars (4), and are spherical or are not spherical (5), is explained . . .\u201d\n\nIn the former texts the order of the affirmative and the negative clauses agrees with that of being eternal and non-eternal, except (4) and (5). The order seems to have been reversed in the course of transmission by copying with a view to retaining them in good order. But in the Chinese Nos. (3), (4), and (5) have the following arrangement of the characters: \u201cBy-causes-not-destroyed\n\n\\(^1\\) p. 24.\n(or) not-by-causes-not-destroyed (3), not-ultimate-particulars (or) ultimate-particulars (4), and, not-spherical (or) spherical (5).\u201d In No. (3) the position of the negative particle agrees with the case of being eternal and non-eternal; accordingly, the order was not changed. Nos. (4) and (5) were probably changed on the analogy of the latter half of No. (3).\n\nThe latter texts show that the order was recovered when the misreading and failure of sense had been noticed. But number (3) did not need to be changed, because the meaning is clear and has no absurdity. Number (4) was not clearly understood and remained as it was. The commentaries on (4) have strange explanations. Consequently, the correct meaning is obtained when we reverse the order in the former texts except (3).\n\nPr. Bh. mentions that \u201cindependency\u201d (an\u0101\u015britatva) and \u201ceternity\u201d are common to all the nine substances with the exception of avayavi-dravya\u00b9 (i.e. \u201ceffects\u201d). \u201cIndependency\u201d has the same meaning as \u201cthey do not inhere in another substance, or they have no substrata (adravyavat or adravya)\u201d. Avayavi-dravya is substances \u201cconsisting of parts\u201d.\n\nChapter ii (1, 2) explains that the nine substances are not destroyed by their effects, and here it is stated that the nine substances, which are non-products, are not destroyed by their causes. The two passages agree with k\u0101rya-k\u0101rana-avirodhitva in Pr. Bh. But the treatise further mentions that the four substances as products are sometimes destroyed by their causes. This is not stated in V.S. Cf. Ny\u0101ya-kandal\u012b, p. 21, \u201cdravy\u0101\u1e47i tu na k\u0101rye\u1e47a vin\u0101\u015byante na-api k\u0101ra\u1e47ena-iti k\u0101rya-k\u0101ra\u1e47a-avirodh\u012bni nity\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 k\u0101ra\u1e47a-vin\u0101\u015bayor abh\u0101v\u0101d eva k\u0101ra\u1e47ena-avina\u015bah anitya-dravy\u0101\u1e47\u0101\u1e41 k\u0101ra\u1e47a-vin\u0101\u015bayoh sambhave \u2019pi k\u0101ra\u1e47ena na vin\u0101\u015bah ki\u1e41 tv-anyena-iti vivekah.\u201d\n\n\u00b9 p. 21. As to avayavi-dravya see Ny\u0101ya-ko\u015ba, p. 79.\n\"Ultimate particulars\" is literally \"extreme-having-particulars, or end-possessing-species\" in Chinese. \"Extreme-having-particulars\" is hardly intelligible. The original Chinese must have been \"having-extreme-particulars\", which is the translation of antya-vi\u015be\u1e63a-vat, or simply antya-vi\u015be\u1e63a.\n\nThe author of the treatise follows Pr. Bh. in the present passage and explains the ultimate particulars ether, time, space, self, mind, and atoms.\n\nSphericity has been explained.\n\n6. Substances and Sense-organs (p. 103)\n\nThe description in this passage differs from V.S. and agrees with Pr. Bh. The latter states that the five substances, earth, water, fire, wind, and ether, have the common properties of being elements (bh\u016btatva), and of being the material causes of the sense-organs (indriya-prak\u1e5btitva), and have the particular attributes of being perceived by the respective sense-organs (b\u0101hya-ekaika-indriya-gr\u0101hya-vi\u015be\u1e63a-gunavattva).\n\nV.S. says that \"in the organ of smell earth is the material cause, inasmuch as it possesses plurality and smell\", and in like manner water, fire, and wind, are the material causes of the organs of taste, sight, and touch. But as to sound and the organ of hearing V.S. differs from Pr. Bh. and the treatise. Sound is an object (artha) which is perceived by the ear and is the mark of ether; but the relation between ether and sound is different from that between earth, etc., and smell, etc. In the latter case the substances and the attributes are perceived at the same time, while in the former case sound is perceived, but\n\n1 p. 22. But the K\u012bra\u1e47\u0101vali explains the last property \"atra vivak\u1e63\u0101-bhedena b\u0101hya-eka-eka-indriya-gr\u0101hya-gunavattvam b\u0101hya-indriya-gr\u0101hya-vi\u015be\u1e63a-gunavattvam ca-iti bodhavyam\" (p. 37). Further, Pr. Bh. says, \"\u015brotram punah \u015brava\u1e47a-vivara-samj\u00f1ako nabho-de\u015b\u0101\u1e25\" (p. 59).\n\n2 8, 2, 5, \"bh\u016byastv\u0101d gandhavattvac ca prthiv\u012b gandha-j\u00f1\u0101ne (i.e. ghr\u0101\u1e47a-indriye) prak\u1e5bti\u1e25.\"\n\n3 8, 2, 6. See N.S. 3, 1, 63.\nether is not perceived at all, that is, sound, as the object of the ear, does not suppose ether as the other attributes do. Besides, ether is one and immaterial. Therefore, ether can by no means be the material cause of the ear, and the ear is not a part of ether (nabho-de\u015ba).\n\nPr. Bh. calls ether an element (bh\u016bta) on the one hand, and one, all-pervading, and the common place for all corporeal things on the other hand. These qualities are contradictory, if they reside in the same substance. Consequently it must be admitted that Pr. Bh. divides ether into two sorts, material (bh\u016bta) and immaterial.\n\nKwh\u0113i-ci explains that there exists ether as an element distinguished from ether (the fifth substance), and this ether as an element is not the same thing as \u0101k\u0101\u015ba-asan\u015bk\u1e5bta, or things in \u0101k\u0101\u015ba-dh\u0101tu (in the Buddhist terminology).\n\n7. Substances and Attributes (pp. 103\u20135)\n\nThe description exactly agrees with Pr. Bh. In V.S. some attributes are not distinctly ascribed to the definite substances; but Pr. Bh. proves that a substance has such and such definite attributes by referring to the corresponding passages in V.S.\n\nAmong the attributes number, extension, individuality, conjunction, and disjunction are possessed by all the nine substances. Smell in earth, viscosity in water, sound in ether, and cognition, pleasure, pain, desire, aversion, effort, merit, and demerit in self are not common to any other substances. Fire, wind, time, space, and mind have not their own particular attributes.\n\nThe distribution of the attributes is not in consistency with V.S. For instance, self as an individual self must have priority and posteriority. Otherwise the attributes in the passage would be those of the substances as causes;\n\n1 pp. 22, 58\u20139. See Kiran\u0101vali, p. 35.\n2 S\u0101pta-pad\u0101rth\u012b, \u201c\u0101k\u0101\u015bas tu gh\u0101\u1e6da-\u0101k\u0101\u015ba-\u0101di-bheda-bhinno \u2018nanta eva\u201d (p. 16).\nbut fluidity in earth and fire could not be intrinsic according to Pr. Bh. and the treatise.\n\nSection 2.\u2014Attribute (pp. 105\u201313)\n\n1. Attributes Perceptible and Imperceptible (pp. 105\u20136)\n\n\"Perceptible\" in this passage is rather \"object of perception\" (pratyak\u1e63a-vi\u1e63aya). Cf. notes on ch. i, 3, 6.\n\nAs for the perceptibility of colour, taste, smell, and touch, V.S. says that they are perceptible in consequence of inhesion in more than one substance (aneka-dravya-samav\u0101y\u0101t) and of particularity of colour, etc.\\(^1\\) Pr. Bh. is of the same opinion.\\(^2\\) Aneka-dravya has the same meaning as mahat, which is applied to ternary atomic compounds and so forth in Pr. Bh. and the present treatise. Consequently, the four attributes residing in atoms and binary atomic compounds are not perceptible.\n\nIn V.S. mahat is not clearly explained, whether it is applied to the aggregate of three atoms, etc., or to the aggregate of two atoms. According to Pr. Bh. and the treatise the former case is correct. V.S. begins the explanation of extensions with the s\u016btra \"k\u0101ra\u1e47a-balutv\u0101c ca\".\\(^3\\) Bahu corresponds to mahat and aneka. Then follows the s\u016btra \"ato viparitam anu\". Anu in this s\u016btra does not mean an atom, but small (an extension), which is applicable to binary atomic compounds. Accordingly bahu, and mahat too, must be from three upwards, though aneka may logically be from two upwards, because it seems to be contradictory to eka. Therefore the four attributes of binary atomic compounds are imperceptible.\n\nBut there are different opinions. Vasu in his commentary on the \u015aata-\u015b\u0101stra states that the aggregates of two atoms are perceptible, and Dharma-p\u0101la refutes the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika theory as follows:\n\n\\(^{1}\\) 4, 1, 6\u201310. \\(^{2}\\) p. 186. \\(^{3}\\) 7, 1, 9.\n\"If products have the same quantity as their causes (= atoms), they cannot be called gross things, since atoms are not named gross, and the colour, etc., of the products are not perceived by the eyes. This is contradictory to your theory.\"\u00b9\n\nAccording to the commentators product means the binary atomic compounds, because they are stated to be the immediate effects of atoms. Accordingly, \"your theory\" must be the opinion that binary atomic compounds are perceptible. Kwh\u0113i-ci also says that the original atoms are not perceptible, but binary atomic compounds, etc., are perceptible. This is not in accordance with our treatise; but the opinion was probably derived from Dharmap\u0101la's work. Even among later Vai\u015be\u1e63ikas some teachers like Mah\u0101deva Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da hold that binary atomic compounds are not supersensuous (at\u012bndriya).\u00b2\n\nSound is different from the four attributes, and is in Pr. Bh.\u00b3 called momentary and continuous. The theory of two qualities of sound was probably due to Buddhist influence. The four attributes need corporeal substances, and are sometimes perceptible and sometimes imperceptible, according to the kinds of their substrata, while sound has no such differences and only needs an empty space. There may be sound which has not reached the ear, but it is not because sound resides in a special ether. Consequently, sound must be heard, if it reaches to the ear. See Pr. Bh. p. 288, quoted in the notes on ch. ii, 3, 4, 5.\n\nConcerning number, extension, individuality, conjunction, disjunction, priority, and posteriority V.S. says that they are visible (c\u0101k\u1e63usa), when they reside in coloured substances (r\u016bpi-dravya-samav\u0101y\u0101t), but invisible when they do not reside in such.\u2074\n\n\u00b9 Vij\u00f1apti-m\u0101trat\u0101-siddhi-s\u0101stra, p. 3a.\n\u00b2 Ny\u0101ya-ko\u015ba, p. 350.\n\u00b3 pp. 287-8.\n\u2074 4, 1, 11-12.\nthe necessary condition, and the substrata must be compounds of more than (two or) three atoms. Pr. Bh. adds fluidity, viscosity, and impetus (a part of impression) to these attributes.\\(^1\\)\n\nGravity is imperceptible (\\(apratyak\u1e63a\\)) or supersensuous (\\(at\u012bndriya\\)) according to Pr. Bh.\\(^2\\) and the Upask\u0101ra.\\(^3\\) But all the extant texts of the treatise have gravity between viscosity and impetus in this passage. Kwh\u0113i-ci says, \u201cThe text (the Chinese translation or the original Sanskrit text) does not mention gravity in this passage; but gravity may be an object of perception, because the attribute is a common attribute of water and earth, as seen in chapter ii (i, 7).\u201d From his statement it is seen that the Sanskrit text and the translation by Yuan Chwang had not enumerated gravity in this passage. C\u02bb-ceu (Chi-sh\u016b), the third patriarch of the F\u0101-hsiang-tsung, commenting on Kwh\u0113i-ci\u2019s commentary, says, \u201cThe commentary states that the text does not mention gravity in this passage. This assertion is due to the fact that the author of the commentary had consulted a corrupt text, since the present text, which I have consulted, has the mention of gravity in the passage. Consequently, gravity must be considered as perceptible and imperceptible according to the substrata.\u201d\\(^4\\) The corruption in the Chinese translation took place in the interval between Kwh\u0113i-ci and C\u02bb-ceu. Kwh\u0113i-ci\u2019s opinion on gravity is not correct, according to Pr. Bh. and the present treatise. But gravity has been differently explained. The Upask\u0101ra states that Vallabh\u0101c\u0101rya is of opinion that gravity is perceived by touch.\\(^3\\)\n\nAs for cognition, etc., Pr. Bh. says, \u201cbuddhi-sukha-\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) p. 187.\n\n\\(^2\\) pp. 263, 98.\n\n\\(^3\\) On 4, 1, 10.\n\n\\(^4\\) Commentary No. 10, p. 206. See Ny\u0101ya-ko\u015ba, p. 238. Vallabh\u0101c\u0101rya is sometimes called Vatsa and the author of the L\u012bl\u0101val\u012b, a commentary on Pr. Bh.\ndu\u1e25kha-icch\u0101-dve\u1e63a-prayatn\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 dvayor \u0101tma-manasol\u014d samyog\u0101d upalabdhi\u1e25.\u201d\u00b9\n\nAccording to Pr. Bh. merit, demerit, and mental impression (bh\u0101van\u0101) are, like gravity, supersensuous (atindriya).\u00b2 \u201cImpression\u201d in the treatise naturally means mental impression (bh\u0101van\u0101), because impetus, which is the physical impression, has been enumerated among the perceptible attributes. For accuracy gravity may be inserted in this paragraph.\n\n2. Attributes as Products and Non-products (p. 106)\n\nPr. Bh. says that cognition, pleasure, pain, desire, aversion, effort, merit, demerit, mental impression, sound, aggregate extension (t\u016bla-parim\u0101\u1e47a), secondary conjunctions (uttara-samyojana), incidental fluidity (naimittika-dravatva), priority and posteriority are produced by conjunction and are not produced by combustion (a-p\u0101kaja). Conjunction, disjunction, and impetus are produced by actions, and sound and secondary disjunctions are produced by disjunction.\u00b3\n\nAccording to V.S. cognition, pleasure, and pain are produced by the contact of the four factors; desire and aversion by pleasure, pain, and ad\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da; merit and demerit by desire and aversion; impression by actions; disjunction by actions, conjunction, and disjunction; and both priority and posteriority are caused by two substances; sound by conjunction, disjunction, and sound; and effort is caused by self.\u2074\n\nColour, taste, smell, and touch, when possessed by earth, are altogether products, because V.S. says that (colour, taste, smell, and touch) produced by combustion have for their antecedents the qualities of their causes,\n\n\u00b9 p. 187, \u201cCognition, pleasure, pain, desire, aversion, and effort are perceived by self and mind in conjunction with each other.\u201d\n\u00b2 p. 98.\n\u00b3 pp. 98\u20139.\n\u2074 3, 2, 1. See notes on ch. i, 3.\nand that there is only one substance.\\footnote{7, 1, 6\u20137.} \"Earth\" in this passage represents combust terrene atoms. The Vai\u015be\u1e63ika is called the Pilu-p\u0101ka-v\u0101da and maintains that combustion takes place in atoms. This theory is different from the Pithara-p\u0101ka-vada (the Ny\u0101ya), which holds that combustion occurs in an earthen pot as a whole. Terrene atoms are combustible, and their four attributes are therefore products. V.S. says that \"the colour, taste, smell, and touch of earth, etc., inasmuch as substances are non-eternal, are also non-eternal\",\\footnote{7, 1, 2\u20133, \"prthivy-\u0101di-r\u016bpa-rasa-\u00e7andha-spar\u015b\u0101 dravya-anityatv\u0101d anity\u0101\u015b ca.\"} and \"by this is declared their eternity in things eternal (etena nitye\u1e63u nityatvam uktam)\". By this the four attributes in earth are known in some cases to be eternal and non-products. According to the Upask\u0101ra the V\u1e5btti replaced the latter s\u016btra by \"nitye\u1e63v-anityatvam uktam\". The V\u1e5btti means that the four attributes in earth disappear on its disjunction from fire, so that the four attributes in both raw and combust terrene atoms are altogether non-eternal. The author of the treatise is probably following such an opinion when he states that the four attributes are, when possessed by earth, altogether products. \"Product\" is almost synonymous with \"non-eternal\", as the next subsection (3) proves. Things are non-eternal and products as well, when they have been produced; but they are not products before having been produced, even though non-eternal. Therefore \"earth\", i.e. terrene atoms, must mean things produced by combustion, because this subsection treats of attributes as products. But in the next subsection (3) \"earth\" is to be understood as implying both raw and combust terrene atoms. The author does not allude to the eternal and non-produced attributes of earth; perhaps he thought the four attributes of earth are altogether non-eternal, and accordingly\nproducts. This is not strictly correct, and is inconsistent with the opinions of the authors of V.S. and Pr. Bh.\n\nColour, taste, touch, fluidity and viscidity, when inherent in aqueous atoms, are non-products, because V.S. says \"the four attributes are eternal in water, fire, and wind, inasmuch as the substances are eternal\".\u00b9 From binary atomic compounds upwards substances are non-eternal and products; therefore their attributes also are non-eternal and products, since V.S. says that in things non-eternal they (the attributes) are non-eternal, because the substances are non-eternal. There is no mention of smell in this paragraph, which shows that the passage refers to water.\n\nAs to gravity Pr. Bh. says, \"gurutvasya ca-ap\u0101di-param\u0101nu-r\u016bpa-\u0101divan nitya-anityatva-nispattay\u0101\u1e25.\"\u00b2 \"Gravity is explained in like manner\" refers to the paragraph on water. Cf. V.S. 2, 1, 2; Pr. Bh., pp. 264\u20136.\n\nAll the extant texts of the treatise have in this paragraph the following addition: \"Eternity and non-eternity are explained as in the case of products and non-products.\" But this is probably superfluous, because there is a special paragraph in the next subsection (3) for eternity and non-eternity. Accordingly the addition is omitted in the translation and in the edition of the Chinese text.\n\nFluidity in earth and fire is stated in V.S. as \"fluidity, through conjunction with fire, of clarified butter, lac and wax is common to them and water\", and \"fluidity, through conjunction with fire, of tin, lead, iron, silver, and gold is common to them with water\".\u00b3 Pr. Bh. also states that earth and fire have the incidental fluidity (naimittika-dravatva-yoga).\u2074 See Pr. Bh., pp. 264\u20135.\n\n\u00b9 7, 1, 4, \"apsu tejas\u012b v\u0101yau ca nity\u0101 dravya-nityatv\u0101t.\"\n\u00b2 p. 263, \"The eternity and non-eternity of this (gravity) are explained in the same manner as those of the colour, etc., in aqueous atoms, etc.\"\n\u00b3 2, 1, 6\u20137.\n\u2074 p. 25.\nConcerning the remaining paragraphs see Pr. Bh. pp. 111-13, 138.\n\n3. Attributes Eternal and Non-eternal (p. 106)\n\nAll the attributes are non-eternal, when they reside in non-eternal substances.\\(^1\\) Kwh\u0113i-ci explains, \"Among the twenty-four attributes cognition, pleasure, pain, desire, aversion, effort, merit, demerit, impression, disjunction, priority, posteriority, sound, and smell\u2014these fourteen attributes are non-eternal. Smell, which abides in earth only, is altogether non-eternal, even when it resides in terrene atoms, as the text (chap. ii, 2, 7, and chap. ii, 5, 3) asserts. The other ten attributes are either eternal or non-eternal; but colour, taste, smell, and touch possessed by earth are non-eternal, etc.\"\n\n4. Varying Perceptibility of Attributes (p. 107)\n\nPr. Bh. states that sound, touch, colour, taste, and smell are severally perceived by one sense-organ, and number, extension, individuality, conjunction, disjunction, priority, posteriority, fluidity, viscidity, and impetus are perceived by two sense-organs (the sight- and the touch-organ); but cognition, pleasure, pain, desire, aversion, and effort are perceived by the internal organ (anta\u1e25-kara\u1e47a, i.e. manas), while gravity, merit, demerit, and mental impression are supersensuous.\\(^2\\) The treatise does not mention cognition, etc., down to mental impression, because these are not perceived by any sense-organs. Mind is not in the treatise called anta\u1e25-kara\u1e47a (see ch. ii, 2, 1).\n\nThe texts of the commentaries Nos. 9 and 10 have, in this paragraph, gravity between posteriority and fluidity; but Kwh\u0113i-ci remarks that \"the organ of touch perceives the eleven attributes, i.e. touch, number, extension, individuality, conjunction, disjunction, priority,\n\n\\(^1\\) 7, 1, 2-4; 7, 1, 18-20.\n\\(^2\\) pp. 96-8.\nposteriority, fluidity, viscidity, and impetus\u201d. The remark evidently shows that the original Sanskrit text and the Chinese translation had not enumerated gravity in this paragraph.\n\n5. Causes of Attributes (pp. 107\u201310)\n\n(1) Compare this subsection with Pr. Bh., pp. 99\u2013100.\n\n(2) Colour, taste, smell, and touch, when inherent in binary atomic compounds, have those of the same class for their causes, that is, colour, etc., in atoms are the causes of colour, etc., in binary atomic compounds. Pr. Bh. says that colour, taste, smell, and cool touch (anu\u1e63\u1e47a-spar\u015ba), together with sound, extension, unity, single individuality, and viscidity produce effects of the same class respectively (sam\u0101na-j\u0101ty-\u0101rambhaka).\n\n(3) Colour, taste, smell, and touch possessed by earth have conjunction with fire as their cause, even though they are attributes of the atoms. \u201cThe atoms\u201d mean those produced by combustion.\n\nThe treatise does not explain the theory of p\u0101ka-ja, and the commentators could not properly understand the meaning of the paragraph.\n\n(4) \u201cEtc.\u201d includes ternary atomic compounds. Gravity, fluidity, and viscidity in atoms have naturally no causes. According to Pr. Bh. gravity and fluidity produce effects of both the same and a different class.\n\n(5) Unity and individuality produce effects of the same class, i.e. duality, etc., and dual individualities are their effects. But duality and dual individualities, like priority and posteriority, are called buddhy-apek\u1e63a, i.e. they have cognition for their efficient cause. Therefore duality and dual individualities have causes of both the same class and different classes.\n\n\u201cSingle individuality has its notion as its cause\u201d may be understood by the help of Pr. Bh., \u201cap\u0101kaja-r\u016bpa-rasa-\n\n1 Pr. Bh., p. 99.\ngandha-spar\u015ba-parim\u0101\u1e47a-ekatva-ekap\u1e5bthaktva-gurutva-dravatva-sneha-veg\u0101\u1e25 k\u0101ra\u1e47a-gu\u1e47a-p\u016brvak\u0101\u1e25.\" Unity and individuality have not as their causes attributes other than cognition.\n\n(6\u20138) See the definition of extension and the notes thereupon.\n\n(9\u201310) Perception and inference are equally divided into four sorts: doubtful (sa\u1e43\u015baya), decisive (nir\u1e47aya), imperfect (avidy\u0101), and perfect knowledge (vidy\u0101).\n\nV.S. mentions sa\u1e43\u015baya, nir\u1e47aya, sm\u1e5bti, svapna, svapn\u0101ntika, vidy\u0101, avidy\u0101, and \u0101r\u1e63a-siddha-dar\u015bana, besides cognition. Pr. Bh. divides cognition into vidy\u0101 and avidy\u0101. The latter contains sa\u1e43\u015baya, viparyaya (contrary or contradiction), anadhyavas\u0101ya (indecisive), and svapna(-j\u00f1\u0101na), while the former is perception, inference, (nir\u1e47aya), sm\u1e5bti, and \u0101r\u1e63a-siddha-dar\u015bana. Viparyaya and anadhyavas\u0101ya are not mentioned in V.S., though viparyaya is said, by the commentators, to be the same as avidy\u0101. These two are enumerated in Pr. Bh. on the analogy of the case of inference. In our treatise sm\u1e5bti is included in impression, and svapna, svapn\u0101ntika, \u0101r\u1e63a-siddha-dar\u015bana are omitted.\n\n(11) Sa\u1e43\u015baya in V.S. is caused by perception of a general, non-perception of a particular; and remembrance of particularity, and by knowledge and want of knowledge.\n\n\"Preceded by the perception of properties common\n\n---\n\n1 p. 98, \"Colour, taste, smell, and touch, when not produced by combustion, extension, unity, single individuality, gravity, fluidity, viscosity, and impetus are preceded (or originated) by (like) attributes in their (respective) causes.\"\n\n2 See notes on ch. ii, 3, 22\u20133 (merit and demerit).\n\n3 pp. 172, 186.\n\n4 9, 2, 10.\n\n5 2, 2, 17, \"s\u0101m\u0101nya-pratyak\u1e63\u0101d vi\u015be\u1e63a-apratyak\u1e63\u0101d vi\u015be\u1e63a-sm\u1e5bte\u015b ca sa\u1e43\u015bayah.\" 2, 2, 20, \"vidy\u0101-avidy\u0101ta\u015b ca sa\u1e43\u015bayah.\" The first three cases are explained by \"dr\u1e63\u1e6da\u1e45 ca dr\u1e63\u1e6davat\" and \"yath\u0101-dr\u1e63\u1e6dam ayath\u0101-dr\u1e63\u1e6davac ca\" (2, 2, 18\u201319).

Bh. explains it, \u201cvi\u1e63e\u1e63a-dar\u015bana-jam avadh\u0101ra\u1e47a-j\u00f1\u0101na\u1e41 sa\u1e43\u015baya-virodh\u012b nir\u1e47ay\u0101\u1e25.\u201d\u00b3\n\n(13\u201314) As to vidy\u0101 and avidy\u0101, V.S. explains that \u201cimperfect cognition results from derangement of the organs of sense and from defect in impression\u201d; \u201cthis is defective cognition,\u201d and \u201cfree from defect it is perfect cognition\u201d.\u2074\n\n\u201cPreceded by the perception, etc.,\u201d implies contact of the four factors and is the indirect cause of the four sorts of perception, while \u201ccontact of self with mind\u201d is the special and direct cause.\n\n(15) The four sorts are also enumerated with regard to inference, and this is correct, because sa\u1e43\u015baya and nir\u1e47aya are produced by perception and inference, and vidy\u0101 and avidy\u0101 relate to sense-organs (i.e. perception) and impression (reminiscence = inference).\n\n(16\u201317) See the notes on ch. i, 2, 9; ch. ii, 2, 1, and 4; V.S. 3, 1, 18.\u2075 The description agrees with Pr.

Existence relates to substances, attributes, and actions, and is perceptible, if the substrata are perceptible. \"Of existence, commonness, potentiality, and non-potentiality, with the exception of the potentiality, non-potentiality, and sound-ness which are inherent in sound\" refers to the next paragraph. Sound is perceptible, but it is not perceived by contact of the four factors. Commonness, potentiality, and non-potentiality are not stated in V.S. and Pr. Bh., but V.S. \"s\u0101m\u0101nya-vi\u015be\u1e63e\u1e63u s\u0101m\u0101nya-vi\u015be\u1e63a-abh\u0101v\u0101t tata (i.e. dravyata) eva j\u00f1\u0101nam\", and \"s\u0101m\u0101nya-vi\u015be\u1e63a-apeks\u0101\u1e41 dravya-gu\u1e47a-karmasu\" may be regarded as the explanation of commonness; and Pr.

Potentiality and non-potentiality are treated just as in the case of commonness, because these three categories equally relate to the first three categories. The cognitions of them are produced by contact of the four factors.\n\nAll the extant texts of the treatise have gravity between posteriority and fluidity; but this, as stated in the notes on ch. ii, 2, 1, and 4, is not correct.\n\n(18) See notes on ch. ii, 1, 4.

But according to Pr. Bh. cognition is pramiti and self is pram\u0101tr (see ch. ii, 2, 1).\n\n(20) The description only refers to the second sort of inference; but the first sort is understood on the analogy of paragraphs 16\u201317.\n\n\"One of the things inherent in one and the same object\" (p. 109) is the representative of the affirmative cases, while \"a thing contradictory to the other\" is the negative case. \"Taking place in consequence of the recollection of the connexions between them\" has various readings, which were caused by misreading and corruption, so that they can hardly be translated. But the proper reading and meaning can be obtained by comparison with the definition in ch. i (3, 12).\n\n(21) See notes on ch. ii, 2, 2, and the paragraphs 16\u201319. Pr.

Improper desire and aversion result from want of perfect knowledge and cause transmigration.\n\n(23) Pr. Bh. explains that desire and aversion are the causes of effort, remembrance, merit, and demerit, and effort is of two sorts, j\u012bvana-p\u016brvaka and icch\u0101-dve\u1e63a-p\u016brvaka. The former is that which makes breathing out and in of a sleeper to be continual, and is the cause of conjunction of the internal organ with other sense-organs at the moment of awakening; this sort of effort is produced by conjunction of self with mind, aided by merit and demerit, while the latter is the cause of exertion for obtaining agreeable things and abandoning disagreeable things, and it also leads to suppression of the body; it is produced by conjunction of self with mind, aided by desire or by aversion.\u00b9 The instinct to live corresponds to j\u012bvana.

The Upask\u0101ra\u2019s explanation is not correct, because the explanation is contradictory to the nature of some attributes. V.S. says \u201cr\u016bp\u0101\u1e47\u0101\u1e41 r\u016bpa\u1e41 (s\u0101m\u0101nya\u1e41 k\u0101ryam)\u201d.\u2075 \u201cDestroyed\u201d means that two things are in the relation of destroyer and destroyed, though they are in the causal relation, or that they do not exist at the same time, according to the commentators.\n\n(2, 7, 13) Pr. Bh. states that sound is momentary and opposed to both its effects and its causes.\u2076 V.S. says \u201cthe transiency (of sound), which is an attribute, is a property common also to actions\u201d.\u2077 The quality momentariness, common to both sound and actions, has probably been derived from this s\u016btra.\n\n(3\u20136, 8\u201312, 14) Pr. Bh. states that cognition, pleasure, pain, desire, aversion, effort, merit and demerit, mental impression, and sound are \u201cak\u0101ru\u1e47a-gu\u1e47a-p\u016brvaka\u201d,\u2078 which \u015ar\u012bdhara explains \u201cnitya-gunatv\u0101t\u201d.

The commentators explain that \u201cthe substances possessing touch\u201d means bodies. According to other passages pleasure and pain are not the direct causes of effort, but desire and aversion are the effects of pleasure and pain and the direct causes of effort. Effort and pain may be in conjunction with a body and not be destroyed by the cause or the effect, that is, the two attributes can exist at the same time.\n\n(15) The cause of reminiscence is the impression of cognition, and pain is the immediate effect of demerit.

Attributes inhering in Substances, etc. (p. 113)\n\nSee the definition of attribute. Pr.

Inherent cause is one of the characteristics of substances, and non-inherent cause is so of attributes.\n\nBut Pr. Bh. states that gravity, fluidity, impetus, effort, merit, demerit, conjunction, and disjunction are the causes of actions (kriy\u0101-hetu); colour, taste, smell, cool touch, number, extension, single individuality, viscidity, and sound are non-inherent causes; cognition, pleasure, pain, desire, aversion, effort, merit, demerit, and mental impression are efficient causes; conjunction, disjunction, hot touch, gravity, fluidity, and impetus are both non-inherent and efficient causes; and priority, posteriority, duality and dual individualities, etc., have not the quality of being cause (ak\u0101ra\u1e47atva).\\(^3\\) These distinctions are not stated in our treatise.\n\nSection 3.\u2014Action (pp. 113\u201316)\n\n1.

The opinion may be justified\n\n\u00b9 p. 290.\n\u00b2 1, 1, 11, \u201ckarma karma-s\u0101dhy\u0101\u1e41 na vidyate,\u201d and 1, 1, 24,\n\u201cgu\u1e47a-vaidharmy\u0101\u1e41 na karman\u0101\u1e41 karma.\u201d\nfrom the nature of atoms, mind, and binary atomic compounds, and from the three sorts of conjunction and disjunction. But the \"some\" are not yet identified.\n\nKwh\u0113i-ci says that \"actions are all perceptible\". But perceptibility of actions is not possible in atoms and binary atomic compounds. Besides, the actions contracting, expanding and going are sometimes imperceptible.\n\n4. Actions in Body, etc. (pp. 114\u201316)\n\n(1) This is a general statement, and the following are special.\n\nActions in body are stated in V.S. 5, 1, 1\u20133, and Pr. Bh., pp. 297\u2013302. \"Body\" implies the members of a body, and \"its organs\" is literally \"cause and accessories\", which is usually the translation of k\u0101ra\u1e47a- (or hetu-) pratyaya, but sometimes is that of kara\u1e47a. See Ny\u0101ya-ko\u015ba, s.v., pp. 174\u20135. At any rate the word must in this case mean \"organs\", and it implies the four sense-organs which \"inhere in the body\".\n\nThe actions in the parts of a body have their inherent causes in the parts, e.g. for the action in the hand the hand is the inherent cause.\n\n(2) \"Conjunction with, and effort of, self\" is literally \"self-conjunction-effort\" in Chinese. V.S. says, \"\u0101tma-s\u0101myoga-prayatn\u0101bhya\u1e41 haste karma.\" In Chinese it is also possible to read \"the effort connected with self\", as the commentators do; but \"conjunction with self and effort of self\" is the correct rendering. Both conjunction and effort are non-inherent causes.\n\n(3) V.S. says that \"the first action of an arrow is from impulsion, the next is from impression caused by that action, and in like manner the next and the next\". The actions leave their impression, and that impression is the non-inherent cause for the second action and so on in order.\n\n1 Cf. Cowell, Sarva-dar\u015bana-sa\u1e45graha, pp. 155\u20137.\n2 5, 1, 1.\n3 5, 1, 17.\n(4) \"Parts\" is the hands, etc. Concerning mind V.S. says that \"the action of mind is explained by that of the hand\".\u00b9\n\n(5) \"Conjunction with self and that of effort (of self) with the body\" is translated on the analogy of para. 2; but it may be correct to understand thus: \"conjunction with the body\u00b2 of effort, which is conjunct with self.\" In Chinese there is no sign of the dual or plural number.\n\nThe paragraphs 2 and 5 have no mention of the ear, because the sensation of sound is passive. Kwh\u0113i-ci explains that \"when sound is produced in ether, the sound causes the perceptional function in a body\". Cf. Pr. Bh., \"eva\u1e41 sant\u0101nena \u015brotra-prade\u015bam \u0101gatasya grahanai\u1e25 \u015brotra-s\u0101dayor g\u0101mana-\u0101gamana-abh\u0101v\u0101d apr\u0101ptasya grahanai\u1e25 n\u0101sti.\"\u00b3\n\n(7) V.S. states that (\"action in the hand is by way of conjunction with, and effort of, self\") \"in like manner, and from conjunction with the hand, is action in the pestle,\" \"in the action produced in a pestle and the like by impact conjunction with the hand is not a cause, being excluded therefrom,\" \"in like manner conjunction with self (is not a cause) in relation to action in the hand,\" and \"the action in the hand is from impact, and from conjunction with pestle\".\u2074\n\n(8\u201311) Paragraphs 1\u20137 describe the conscious actions, while these paragraphs mention the unconscious actions and correspond to V.S. 5, 1, 7\u201313, and Pr. Bh., pp. 308\u20139.\n\nV.S. says that \"in the absence of conjunction falling (patana) results from gravity\".\u2075 Gravity is the non-inherent cause, and the body of a sleeper is the inherent cause. There is the impression left by the action falling,\n\n\u00b9 5, 2, 14. \u00b2 Cf. Upask\u0101ra on 5, 1, 1\u20132. \u00b3 p. 288.\n\u2074 5, 1, 2\u20135, \"tath\u0101 hasta-s\u0101myog\u0101 ca musale karma,\" \"abh\u012bgh\u0101taje musal\u0101dau karman\u012b vyatirek\u0101d ak\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u0101\u1e41 hasta-s\u0101myogah,\" \"tath\u0101-\u0101tm\u0101-s\u0101myoga hasta-karman\u012b,\" and \"abh\u012bgh\u0101t\u0101n musala-s\u0101myog\u0101d dhaste karma\".\n\u2075 5, 1, 7, \"s\u0101myoga-abh\u0101ve gurutv\u0101t patanai\u1e25.\"\nand the impression and gravity are the non-inherent causes for the second action and so forth.\n\nV.S. states that \"movement (calana) of a sleeper takes place even in the absence of effort.\"\u00b9 Cf. Pr. Bh., \"pr\u0101\u1e47a-\u0101khye tu v\u0101yau karma . . . suptasya tu j\u012bvana-p\u016brvaka-prayatna-apeks\u0101t.\"\u00b2 \"Effort\" in \"conjunction of effort with self\" is j\u012bvana-p\u016brvaka in Pr. Bh. Consequently \"the absence of effort\" in V.S. is to be understood like \"the absence of conscious effort\".\n\n(12) From this paragraph the actions in nature are explained. These actions are stated in V.S. 5, 1, 14, 5, 2, 13, and in Pr. Bh., pp. 303\u20137. The explanation is one of the characteristics of the system, and distinguishes it from the S\u0101\u1e45khya, the Ved\u0101nta, and other systems.\n\nV.S. says that \"flowing (syandana) results from fluidity.\"\u00b3 See Pr. Bh., p. 302.\n\n(14, 19) V.S. states that \"The upward flaming of fire, the sideward blowing of wind, and the first action of atoms and of mind, are caused by destiny (ad\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da)\"\u2074; see Pr. Bh., p. 309. \"The conjunction of ad\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da (i.e. merit and demerit) with self is stated in Pr. Bh., pp. 48\u20139.\n\n(16) Cf. V.S. 4, 2, 1\u20135 (anu-samyojas tv-aprat\u012b\u1e63iddha\u1e25), and Pr. Bh., pp. 48\u20139, 308\u20139 (tath\u0101 sarga-k\u0101le pratyagrena \u015barire\u1e47a sambandh\u0101rth\u0101\u1e41 karma-ad\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da-k\u0101rit\u0101\u1e41).\n\n(18) V.S. states that \"the circulation (abhisarpa\u1e47a) in trees is caused by destiny\"\u2075 (Pr. Bh., pp. 305\u20136, 48\u20139).\n\n(19) Cf. V.S., \"the egress and ingress (of mind from and into bodies), conjunction with things eaten and drunk, and conjunctions with other effects\u2014all these things are caused by destiny.\"\u2076\n\n\u00b9 5, 1, 13, \"prayatna-abh\u0101ve prasuptasya calanam.\"\n\u00b2 p. 308.\n\u00b3 5, 2, 4, \"dravatv\u0101t syandanam.\"\n\u2074 5, 2, 13, \"agner \u0101rdhv\u0101-jvalan\u0101\u1e41 v\u0101yos tiryak-pavanam an\u016bn\u0101\u1e41 manasa\u015b ca-\u0101dyakarma-ad\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da-k\u0101ritam.\"\n\u2075 5, 2, 7, \"vrk\u1e63a-abhisarpanam ity ad\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da-k\u0101ritam.\"\n\u2076 5, 2, 17, \"apasarpanam upasarp\u0101nam ak\u012bta-p\u012bta-samyog\u0101\u1e25 k\u0101rya-antara-samyojas ca-ity-ad\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da-k\u0101rit\u0101ni.\"\n(21) \"The actions in the (present) world\" is literally \"earth-foot-karma\", which is in Chinese not at all intelligible. But it seems to be the literal translation of bh\u016bmi-tala-karma (or prthiv\u012b-tala-karma?), which is literally \"the actions on the surface of the earth\".\n\n\"The ripening of the happy and the unhappy effects\" is the translation of hita-ahita-vip\u0101ka. The commentators say: \"Vip\u0101ka means ripening (of effects) different (from their causes), that is, merit brings about pleasure or good, and demerit brings about pain or evil. Thus the cause and the effects are of different classes.\"\n\n(23) V.S. states that \"action in earth results from impulsion, impact, and conjunction with the conjunct\", \"the falling of water in the absence of conjunction results from gravity,\" \"the sun's rays cause the ascent of water through conjunction with wind, through the impress of the impulsion, and conjunction with the conjunct,\" \"particular impulsion results from particular effort,\" and \"the action of fire and that of wind are explained by the action of earth\". Cf. Pr. Bh., \"tatra nodanam gurutvadr\u0101vatva-vega-prayatn\u0101n samasta-vyast\u0101n apek\u1e63\u0101ma\u1e47o yah sa\u1e41yoga-vi\u015be\u1e63o nodanam avibh\u0101ga-hetor ekasya karman\u0101\u1e25 k\u0101ra\u1e47\u0101\u1e41 tasm\u0101c catursv-\u0101pi mah\u0101bh\u016bte\u1e63u karma bhavati.\"\n\n(24) The paragraph refers principally to the last paragraph (23).\n\nGravity does not exist in fire, and fluidity is not possessed by wind.\n\nWind and mind are not mentioned in the last paragraph, which is intended to cite the five corporeal substances. But mind has not impulsion and impact (nodana and abh\u012bgh\u0101ta); accordingly it is omitted in that paragraph.\n\n1 5, 2, 1, \"nodana-abh\u012bgh\u0101t\u0101 sa\u1e41yukta-sa\u1e41yog\u0101c ca prthivy\u0101\u1e41 karma\"; 5, 2, 3, \"ap\u0101\u1e41 sa\u1e41yoga-abh\u0101ve gurutv\u0101t patanam\"; 5, 2, 5-6, \"n\u0101dyo v\u0101yu-sa\u1e41yog\u0101d \u0101roha\u1e47am, nodana-\u0101pi\u1e0d\u0101n\u0101t sa\u1e41yukta-sa\u1e41yog\u0101c ca\"; 5, 1, 9, \"prayatna-vi\u015be\u1e63\u0101n nodana-vi\u015be\u1e63\u0101\u1e25\"; and 5, 2, 12, \"prthiv\u012b-karman\u0101 tejah-karma v\u0101yu-karma ca vy\u0101khy\u0101tam.\" Cf. 5, 1, 8; 10; 18.\n\n2 p. 303.\nWind has perhaps particular impulsion and impact (both impulsion and impact are *samyoga-visesa*), and is not treated like the other three substances. Accordingly, wind is also omitted in the last paragraph. The commentators explain that this paragraph is the conclusion of the whole subsection 4; but this is not correct.\n\n**Section 4.\u2014Existence** (p. 116)\n\nThis hardly needs an explanation.\n\nKwh\u0113i-ci remarks that \"existence and particularity are incorporeal, though the treatise does not mention this\", and further, \"the five categories other than the first three, i.e. existence, particularity, inherence, non-potentiality, and commonness (naturally except non-existence), and the five substances, ether, time, space, self, and mind are eternal, but they are not productive.\" But even the category potentiality has no productiveness. Potentiality is abstraction of the productive faculty from productive substances, as action is abstraction and has no action in itself.\n\nThe commentators explain the category thus, \"existence is that which makes substances, etc., existent, that is, by virtue of the category substances, etc., can exist.\" But we have to bear in mind that the category existence does not make non-existent things existent. Existence is also an abstraction and the cause of the notion that substances, etc., are existent.\n\n**Section 5.\u2014Particularity** (p. 117)\n\nThe description distinctly shows that the category particularity is inherent in ether, time, and space, and in nothing else. The commentators explain that ether, time, and space have neither priority nor posteriority; and, if the category is not inherent in these three substances, there cannot be, with regard to them, the notion that that is ether, time, or space. The author of\nthe treatise specially mentions the three substances, because it is not easy to know that the category inheres in them. \"It exists in ether, space, and time\" does not exclude the other six substances, because the treatise distinctly states that the nine substances have each particularity.\n\nWhy, then, is self not enumerated in this passage? Probably because the author acknowledges plurality of self in regard to its appearances, and consequently self has priority and posteriority (see ch. ii, 2, 5, and 8; ch. ii, 3, 4). Or the author may mean that the three substances are, though possessing neither priority nor posteriority, three distinct entities and not one entity. If the ultimate particulars contain the nine substances as causes, the three substances can never be one. In this connexion the treatise is more consequent than Pr. Bh. (cf. p. 137).\n\nKwh\u0113i-ci remarks, \"Particularity is not perceptible, like potentiality and non-potentiality, although the treatise does not distinctly express this.\" But potentiality and non-potentiality are perceptible or not according as they inhere in different substrata; see ch. ii, 2, 5 (16\u201318). According to Dharma-p\u0101la the fifth category, universality-particularity, is perceptible, but particularity, being restricted to the ultimate particulars, is imperceptible. The treatise does not enumerate inherence, non-existence, and particularity among the perceptible categories in ch. ii (2, 5, 16\u201318).\n\nSection 6.\u2014Inherence (p. 117)\n\n\"The cause of being inherent\" is literally \"producing-reaching-cause\". This is not clear. It may be a translation of udbh\u016bta-k\u0101ra\u1e47a. But this Sanskrit is not suitable for the passage. \"Producing-reaching\" is probably an equivalent of samaveta. Any way stress must not be laid upon the meaning of \"production\", because inherence is not at all productive.\nThere is no mention of inherence and non-existence among the categories in which inherence inheres, because inherence does not inhere in itself or in non-existence.\n\nInherence is imperceptible, as Dharma-p\u0101la states. Pr. Bh. says, \u201cata eva-at\u012b-indriy\u0101\u1e25 satt\u0101din\u0101m iva pratya-k\u1e63e\u1e47u v\u1e5btty-abh\u0101v\u0101t sva-\u0101tm\u0101-gata-samvedan\u0101-abh\u0101v\u0101c ca tasm\u0101d iha buddhy-anumey\u0101\u1e25 samav\u0101ya iti.\u201d\n\n\u201cInherence has for mark (li\u1e45ga or lak\u1e63a\u1e47a) the recognition, (of its existence)\u201d has the same meaning as Pr. Bh. Inherence is the cause of iha-buddhi and has at the same time iha-buddhi as the mark of its existence. The reality of inherence is rejected by the Ved\u0101nta and the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101.\n\nAs for the other qualities, see Pr. Bh., pp. 326\u20138.\n\nSections 7\u20138.\u2014Potentiality and Non-potentiality (p. 117)\n\n\u201cIt is something inherent in the categories, with the exception of universality, potentiality, non-potentiality, commonness, and particularity\u201d shows that the five categories are not productive; the productive categories are the first three categories only. \u201cThe cause of the notions\u201d is literally \u201cthe mark of the notions\u201d. \u201cThe mark\u201d was probably suggested by \u201cinherence has the mark\u201d in the last section and took the place of \u201cthe cause\u201d during the transmission of the treatise by copying. No category can be the mark of the notion, and the treatise does not usually use \u201cthe mark\u201d in such a case. \u201cThe mark\u201d in the last section is used because inherence is imperceptible. Cf. Section 5.\n\nSection 9.\u2014Commonness (p. 118)\n\nAs to \u201ccommonness is one\u201d Kwh\u0113i-ci states that \u201cCommonness is manifold, like attributes, actions, particularities, potentialities, non-potentialities, and non-existences\u201d.\n\n1 p. 329.\n2 Brahma-s\u016btra, 2, 2, 13 f.; \u015aloka-v\u0101rttiku, Anum\u0101na-pariccheda, 41. 100 f.; cf. Prabh\u0101kara School, p. 92.\nThe treatise means that commonness in substances is one and commonness in another category is another, while Kwh\u0113i-ci means that commonness is manifold, because commonness in substances is different from that in attributes. Pr. Bh. says \u201c(s\u0101m\u0101nya\u1e25) dravy\u0101di\u1e63u v\u1e5btti-niyam\u0101t pratyaya-bhed\u0101c ca parasparata\u015b ca-anyatvai\u1e25, pratyek\u0101n sva-\u0101\u015braye\u1e63u lak\u1e63a\u1e47a-avi\u1e63e\u1e63\u0101d vi\u1e63e\u1e63a-lak\u1e63a\u1e47a-abh\u0101v\u0101c ca-ekatvai\u1e25\u201d.\n\nSection 10.\u2014Non-existence (pp. 118\u201319)\n\n1. Non-existences Eternal and Non-eternal (pp. 118\u201319)\n\nEternal \u201csubsequent non-existence\u201d means the non-existence when things have been destroyed and will never be produced, and eternal \u201creciprocal non-existence\u201d is the non-existence which never gives place to mutual association. Such subsequent non-existence has a beginning, but it has no end. The subsequent non-existence which may have an end is a kind of antecedent non-existence; but this is classified in the treatise under natural non-existence. Reciprocal non-existence is, if it is succeeded by mutual association, also to be classified under natural non-existence; but reciprocal non-existence is eternal and differs from absolute non-existence only in the point of having relativity.\n\n\u201cUniversality-particularity, like substance-ness, etc.,\u201d evidently shows that the ninth category is called in the original Sanskrit s\u0101m\u0101nya-vi\u1e63e\u1e63a, because \u201cuniversality-particularity\u201d cannot be two categories, otherwise substance-ness is contained in universality (= existence), and particularity is superfluous.\n\n\u201cExistence does not inhere in universality, etc.\u201d\n\n1 p. 314, \u201cUniversalities are different from one another according as they reside in substances, etc., and because the notions of them are different (with regard to each of them); (on the other hand) universality is one in all its substrata (of the same category), inasmuch as there is no particularity of the marks and there does not exist any particular mark therein.\u201d\n\"Etc.\" implies potentiality, non-potentiality, commonness, and particularity.\n\nKwh\u0113i-ci remarks that \"products and non-products of non-existences will be explained on the analogy of their eternity and non-eternity.\"\n\n2. Non-existences Perceptible and Imperceptible (p. 119)\n\n\"Those which exist without being supported by other things\" or \"those which do not depend upon other things\" may be the translation of aparatantra-v\u1e5btti (or aparatantra), and is explained by some commentators as follows:\n\n\"'Those which exist without being supported by other things' means the categories other than non-existence, e.g. inherence, existence, potentiality, non-potentiality, and commonness. Particularity is not enumerated, although the category is imperceptible, because particularity exists in dependence upon substances.\" Other commentators say: \"But existence, potentiality, non-potentiality, and commonness are perceptible and cannot be classified among the objects of inference, while inherence is imperceptible.\" Therefore \"those\" or \"that\", according to the commentators, \"includes inherence only.\"\n\nThe explanations are not correct. The paragraph is distinctly expressed in the plural number (\"altogether\" is literally \"all\"), and is the continuation of the last paragraph. It naturally relates to non-existences.\n\nThe meaning is that absolute non-existence and eternal reciprocal non-existence are known by inference, i.e. by the second sort of inference; therefore the paragraph is the detailed explanation of the last.\n\n\"All the five non-existences are not the objects of perception\" in the last paragraph may relate to both the first and the second sort of inference; but the first sort of inference is principally referred to, that is, the non-existences are not the objects of perception; they are\ninferred from perceptible objects. And the eternal non-existences are the objects of the second sort of inference.\n\nSection II.\u2014Conclusion (p. 119)\n\nPr. Bh. states that the common properties of the six categories are astitva, abhidheyatva, and j\u00f1eyatva (p. 16).\n\n\"Knowable\" represents j\u00f1eyatva, while astitva and abhidheyatva are included in \"causes of their recognitions\".\n\nThe categories which only relate to the first three categories are existence (= universality), potentiality, non-potentiality, commonness, and non-existence.\n\nThe category inherence is in relation to the other eight, except non-existence, and particularity only to substances.\n\nThe categories attribute and action are in relation to the other nine, while the category substance relates to the ten, including substances.\n\nSubstance is known to be the principal, and the other nine categories are the means to the explanation of substances. Consequently, the nine categories, however independent and real, could hardly have a meaning, if they were considered apart from substances. The consequence may lead to the conclusion that the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika system intends principally to explain things and phenomena in nature as they are.
