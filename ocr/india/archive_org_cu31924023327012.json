Thomson,\nMr. Zung song ching,\nMr. Wong kai zur.\nChinese Porcelain\n\nCordial assistance was given by various high officials of the Chinese Empire, from places so far apart as Peking, Canton and Nanchang, and was in a great measure due to the personal influence of Dr. J. C. Ferguson, Councillor to the Viceroy of Nanking and Wuchang.\n\nSome of the choicest pieces of the well-known collections of H.E. Tuan Fang, Viceroy of the Liang-kiang, H.E. King siao san, Governor of Nanchang, Mr. Li chi bai of Canton and Taotai Hwang chung huei of Peking, were kindly loaned and selections were carefully made from the numerous collections in Shanghai and neighbourhood.\n\nThe Exhibition was an unqualified success and comprised about 3,000 pieces; a gratifying interest was shown by the large attendance of Chinese high officials and gentry at the opening ceremony, when speeches were made by H.E. Tsai Nai Hwang, Taotai of Shanghai, the late Mr. T. W. Kingsmill, Vice-President of the North-China branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, the Hon. Charles Denby, Consul-General for the United States of America, Mr. David Landale, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Mr. C. O. Liddell, Chairman of the Committee; and mention was specially made of the services of Mrs. Ayscough, Dr. Stanley, Taotai Hoo erh mai, Taotai Shen tun ho and Mr. Zung song ching.\n\nIt is hoped that the examples in this volume will be of interest to collectors as showing Porcelain and Works of Art which are admired and valued by native and foreign connoisseurs resident in China. All the pieces owned by foreigners were obtained in China and mostly with the advice and assistance of the best native experts.\n\nThe Chinese characters on the cover, \"Book on Chinese Porcelain and Fine Arts compiled by Bahr,\" have been kindly written for the author by H.E. Lord Li Ching-fong, Chinese Minister to the Court of Saint James's.\n\nThe coloured illustrations are reproductions of careful paintings by the Chinese artist, Wong chun hai.\nIntroduction\n\nThe author has to thank Mr. C. O. Liddell, of Shanghai, for collaboration in descriptions originally written of the various articles illustrated, Mr. F. E. Wilkinson, H.B.M. Consul at Newchang, for the \"Notes on Chinese Porcelain\" written for the Exhibition, and especially Mr. James Orange, formerly of Hongkong, for valuable assistance in undertaking to revise and see this book through the Press.\n\nA.

It is hoped that they will stimulate their interest in the subject, and lend some additional attraction in their eyes to the many beautiful exhibits on view. If complaint be made that the amount of information given is meagre, it should be remembered that within the limits of a pamphlet it is impossible to go very deeply into the subject. Examples of every variety of porcelain referred to hereafter will be found on view, and, if all of them are not the best specimens of their class, they are sufficiently representative to enable one to form a good idea of the wonderful achievements of the Chinese potter.\n\nDefinition of Porcelain.\u2014Porcelain is defined by Dr. Bushell, our greatest authority on the subject, as a white, hard pottery which has been vitrified and made translucent by firing. The Chinese describe it as a hard, compact, fine-grained pottery which may be distinguished from ordinary pottery or earthenware by the clear musical note which it gives out on percussion and by the test that it cannot be scratched with a knife. The body consists of two essential elements, white clay, or kaolin, and felspathic stone, or petuntse. The two are mixed together with water to form a paste, which is made into the shape required either by lathe or mould. The piece is then exposed to the sun to dry and, when dry, the colour and glaze are applied. This is usually done in one of three ways\u2014the colour is either applied first and the\nChinese Porcelain\n\nglaze after, so that the colours appear under the glaze as in blue and white; or the two are mixed together and applied, as in celadon and single-coloured decoration generally; or the glaze is applied first and the colour after, so that the colours appear over the glaze as in polychrome decoration. The firing is done, as a rule, immediately after the application of the glaze, so that in over-glaze decoration the piece must have passed through the kiln before the colours can be applied, and to fix them a second firing is necessary. In actual practice many other materials are added to the kaolin and petuntse in the preparation of porcelain, but they are the essential elements. In the composition of the glaze, petuntse is also used, but for this purpose it must be of the very best quality. It is mixed with purified lime and water, and put on the raw body with a brush by dipping or insufflation.\n\nDate of Invention.\u2014Chinese literature ascribes the invention of porcelain to a period some twenty-five centuries before Christ. Foreign experts are by no means certain that the art existed before the seventh century after Christ. No trace of any earlier porcelain can be found, and it is doubtful whether, until the time of the Mings (1368-1644 A.D.), any other porcelain than celadons or single-coloured glazes were manufactured.\n\nCHRONOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION OF CHINESE PORCELAIN.\n\nThe usual chronological classification of Chinese porcelain is as follows:\u2014\n\n1.\u2014Primitive Period, including the Sung Dynasty (960-1279) and the Y\u00fcan Dynasty (1280-1367).\n\n2.\u2014Ming Period, comprising the whole of the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644).\n\n3.\u2014Kang-Hsi (Kanghe) Period, extending from the fall\nNotes on Chinese Porcelain\n\nof the Ming Dynasty to the close of the reign of Kang-Hsi (1662-1723).\n\n4.\u2014Yung-Cheng and Ch\u2019ien-Lung (Kienlung) Period (1723-1796), the two reigns being conjoined.\n\n5.\u2014Modern Period, from the beginning of the reign of Chia-Ch\u2019ing to the present day (1796-1908).\n\nPrimitive or Sung Period.\n\nThe productions of this period are, as might be expected, of very primitive aspect. The pieces that survive are covered with glazes of single colours either of uniform or mottled tint and exhibit either plain or crackled surfaces. The colours usually met with are white, pale purple, often splashed over with red, celadon or other greens, pale grey blue or clair-de-lune, and deep purple or aubergine. Genuine pieces are greatly treasured by native collectors, but are not often seen in foreign collections.\n\nMing Period (1368-1644).\n\nDuring the Ming Period great advances were made in Chinese ceramic art. It was then that the manufacture of porcelain became concentrated at Ching T\u00ea Chen in the Kiangsi Province, which thenceforward practically monopolised the production of artistic porcelain. Here all the old glazes of repute were reproduced in succession and newer methods of decoration invented. We now, for the first time, come across porcelain decorated in colours.\n\nThe first form which this decoration took was blue under the glaze, used both alone and in combination with white. A brilliant red colour was then discovered which, as we know from the writings of the time, attracted universal admiration. Enamel colours, that is, colours applied over the glaze and which stand up on the surface, were first employed to relieve and heighten the blue or the red; then\nChinese Porcelain\n\nthey began to be used in combination, until gradually they predominated in the scheme of coloured decoration now known to us as \u201cMing Five Colours.\u201d\n\nThe blue and white made during the Ming Period is more remarkable for the brilliancy of the blue than for any excellence of quality. The pieces one sees are usually thick and heavy, with pitted and irregular surfaces. There is, however, about many of them a freedom and freshness of design that makes them very pleasing to the eye.\n\nTo the collector the blue and white of this period does not compare in interest with the pieces decorated in colours, although to the uninitiated the attractions of the latter are not always discernible. The decoration is usually in five colours and, as green is the predominating colour, such pieces are classed in the famille verte. The other colours used are blue under the glaze, red, yellow and aubergine over it. As compared with similar pieces belonging to the next period the Ming pieces of this class left us are poor in quality, shape and colouring. It is their rareness and originality that make them so very desirable to collectors.\n\nBlanc-de-Chine.\u2014In addition to Ching T\u00ea Chen there were during the Ming Period two other centres of some note where the manufacture of porcelain was carried on. One of these centres was T\u00ea Hua in Fukien, where the white porcelain known to us as blanc-de-Chine was produced. It differs widely from other Chinese porcelain, the paste being of a creamy white tint resembling ivory, of which, in fact, it is meant to be an imitation, while the thick rich glaze, which has a satiny aspect, blends closely with the paste underneath. The best examples of this ware are the well-modelled images of Buddhist divinities, of which, owing to their careful preservation in temples, many yet survive, but it was the cups and bowls of egg-shell thickness that brought most fame to the factory. A bowl of this egg-shell ware, which is now extremely rare, is on view in the Exhibition.\nNotes on Chinese Porcelain\n\nCeladon.\u2014The other centre was at Lung Ch'uan in Chekiang, where celadon only was produced. The name \"celadon,\" it should be explained, is used to describe both a class and a special colour, namely, the large and varied class of single glaze decoration and a particular sea-green colour which was the commonest form of single glaze decoration during both the Sung and the Ming Periods. All the celadon produced at Lung Ch'uan was of this particular colour. It was an attempt on the part of the old Chinese potter to imitate the much prized green jade. Celadon is believed to have been the first porcelain ever seen in England, a bowl of it having been presented to New College, Oxford, by Archbishop Warham, in the early part of the 15th century. It was exported from China during the T'ang Dynasty (A.D. 618\u2013906), and was well known and much valued in Persia and India long before it was ever heard of in Europe. Owing to the esteem, no doubt, in which it was held by Eastern royalties the marvellous property was attributed to celadon of denoting by changing its colour the presence of poison in the food served in it. At present this ancient ware is less prized in Europe than by Chinese and Japanese connoisseurs, who give high prices for pieces of exactly the correct shape and shade of green. The factory at Lung Ch'uan was closed before the end of the Ming Dynasty, and since then celadon has only been manufactured at Ching T\u00e8 Chen.\n\nKang-Hsi Period (1662-1723).\n\nWe have now reached\u2014to quote Dr. Bushell\u2014the culminating epoch of the ceramic art of China by common consent of all connoisseurs. The brilliant renaissance of the art, which distinguishes the reign of Kang-Hsi, is shown in every class\u2014in the single-coloured glazes; in painted decorations; and in the inimitable blue and white. It is impossible within the limits of this paper to classify\nChinese Porcelain\n\nthe various methods of decoration employed during this period. To do so would merely confuse the uninitiated. It will be sufficient to mention the varieties most commonly met with and those most prized by collectors.\n\nMonochromes.\u2014The glaze is really the master quality in porcelain, and many of the single glazes of this period cannot be passed over without notice. From this reign we date the three most famous and costly of all, the rare apple green, the even more celebrated ruby red or sang-de-b\u0153uf, and the much prized peach bloom, the glazes in every case being derived from copper silicates with which were mixed, the Chinese tell us, pulverised rubies and other precious stones. The brilliant sang-de-b\u0153uf of this period is really a revival of the \u201csacrificial red\u201d glaze of the Ming Dynasty. Peach bloom was discovered later in the reign. It is described by Dr. Bushell as \u201ca pale red becoming pink in some parts, in others mottled with russet spots displayed on a background of light green celadon tint.\u201d Peach bloom has obtained an extraordinary vogue amongst collectors and fetches absurd prices. A small vase 8 inches high was sold not long ago for \u00a33,000. A new bright black shot with purple, the \u201cravenswing\u201d of collectors, mazarin blue, turquoise blue, powder blue, and coral red were other discoveries, but perhaps the most brilliant monochromes of this time are the plain washes of the enamel colours used in polychrome decoration, such as the green of the famille verte.\n\nPolychrome Decoration.\u2014By polychrome decoration we mean pieces belonging either to the three-coloured (san t\u2019sai) or five-coloured class (wu t\u2019sai).\n\nThree-colours.\u2014Three-coloured pieces are so called because they are supposed to be decorated with yellow, green and aubergine only. The ground is generally covered with a yellow glaze on which the green and aubergine appear in diaper patterns or other designs. In many cases, however, black is also employed along with the\nNotes on Chinese Porcelain\n\nother three colours. To the connoisseur there is a charm and fascination about this class of porcelain which is not always apparent to the average man. Three-coloured pieces of this period are becoming rare and already fetch fancy prices.\n\n**Five-Colours.**\u2014Until almost the very end of the reign of Kang-Hsi, green continued to be the predominating colour employed in the decoration of five-coloured pieces, which are classed therefore during this period in the *famille verte*. There are so many examples of this class of porcelain in the Exhibition that no description is necessary. The colours used were the same as in the Ming Period, but the porcelain and painting are far finer. Good specimens of the *famille verte* are not yet uncommon, but the demand for them in England has made them very costly. Powdered blue vases with white reserves filled with *famille verte* are particularly sought after by collectors.\n\n**Blue and White.**\u2014The reign of Kang-Hsi is more famous perhaps for its blue and white than for any other kind of porcelain produced during the sixty years it lasted. A specimen of blue and white, to be considered of the finest quality, should possess five points: the blue should be of the finest colour, the white the purest white, the drawing perfectly clean and fine in outline and shading, the shape elegant in form, and the glaze brilliant and uninjured. There are very few pieces which possess all these qualifications, and these all date from the Kang-Hsi Period. It is impossible to explain on paper what blue it is that is considered the finest, but the uninitiated may obtain some idea of what the best is like by examining the exhibits on view, several of which possess most, if not all, the five points required. The most beautiful and valuable specimens of this class are the hawthorn ginger jars decorated with rising and falling sprays of prunus blossom reserved in white on a marbled blue ground. One of these vases was recently sold in England for\nChinese Porcelain\n\n\u00a35,900. Many attempts have been made to imitate this class of porcelain, but no genuine connoisseur can ever be deceived in a piece of good quality. There can be no doubt that time has done something for the pieces of the 17th century, and to the expert their counterfeits never look the age ascribed to them. Blue and white has this advantage over other kinds of porcelain, that the eye does not need special training to appreciate its beauties, which are apparent to everyone. Except for pieces of the very best quality, the price of blue and white of the Kang-Hsi period is still comparatively moderate, and there is plenty of it on the market.\n\nYung-Cheng and Ch\u2019ien-Lung Periods (1723-1796).\n\nThe two reigns of Yung-Cheng and Ch\u2019ien-Lung are taken together on account of the similarity of their ceramic productions. The brilliant greens which predominated in the polychrome decoration of the reign of Kang-Hsi and earned for it the name of famille verte are now supplanted by rose reds of crimson and pink shades. This new style of decoration is known as the famille rose (fen t\u2019sai).\n\nFamille Rose.\u2014No class shows a greater variety of decoration than the famille rose. From the boldly drawn designs of the earlier pieces it ranges to the miniature painting to be found on the egg-shell dishes and plates of the latter years of Ch\u2019ien-Lung. In technique the products of this period are superior to anything of the past, the drawing being more correct and the colouring more carefully blended. Yet there can be no doubt that connoisseurs prefer the less finished style of the magnificent famille verte pieces of the Kang-Hsi period. The standard aimed at, however, during the period under review was unquestionably even higher than before, particular attention being paid to the fineness of the porcelain, which was looked upon not as a mere conveyance for the decoration,\nNotes on Chinese Porcelain\n\nbut as a thing to be admired in itself. It is the opinion of many excellent judges that, in time, the famille rose will become the most valued of all descriptions of porcelain. Visitors will be able to judge for themselves which of the two styles of decoration possesses the greater attractions. It will be noticed that the productions of this period show a marked European influence both in their shape and ornament, due partly to the influence of the Jesuit artists at Peking and partly to the copying of designs sent from Europe.\n\nBlue and White.\u2014The blue and white of both reigns is inferior to that of Kang-Hsi, the like of which we shall never see again. Some of the Yung-Cheng pieces are, however, extremely handsome, the drawing being excellent and the blue of a very vivid description.\n\nEgg-shell.\u2014Egg-shell china is so called because it is supposed to be no thicker than the shell of an egg. The Chinese claim to have possessed the art of making it as far back as the 15th century, and we have already referred to the cups and bowls produced during the Ming Dynasty at T\u00ea Hua in Fukien. Egg-shell began to be manufactured again during the period under review and runs parallel with the famille rose class. As it was made only for export to Europe, where, towards the end of the 18th century, egg-shell dessert services were all the fashion, very little of this ware is to be found in China. In Europe, on the other hand, it is fairly common in the form of plates. The fineness of the porcelain and the beautiful painting on them have caused these plates to be much sought after by collectors, who will pay anything up to \u00a3100 for a fine specimen. The colouring at the back of them varies in shade from purple to rose, whence the name, ruby-back plates, by which they are generally known.\n\nSoft Paste Porcelain.\u2014Although the best authorities deny that soft paste porcelain, as understood in Europe,\nChinese Porcelain\n\nhas ever been made in China, there is a class of porcelain, also much sought after by collectors, both in China and abroad, which is generally known by that name. In its manufacture, instead of white clay or kaolin, a material called *wha she* is used. Some of this soft paste belongs to the end of the reign of Kang-Hsi, but most of it was made during the reigns of Yung-Cheng and Ch'ien-Lung, and is therefore classed in the period under review. It may be known from ordinary or hard paste porcelain by its light weight, its crackle\u2014though one occasionally comes across uncrackled pieces\u2014its fine grain, and the vellum-like appearance of the painting, particularly of the blue and white, which is its most common form of decoration. If a piece of so-called soft paste is heavy but otherwise answers to the description, it means that the body is not soft paste throughout but is merely coated with the composition. Some of the blue and white pieces are very beautiful, and there are many collectors who confine themselves to this particular form of porcelain. Needless to say it is an expensive hobby.\n\n**Monochromes.**\u2014There is nothing very original about the monochromes or single-coloured glazes of this period, which, with a few exceptions, do not compare well with those of Kang-Hsi. Special attention appears, however, to have been paid to flamb\u00e9 glazes. These are glazes of variegated hues known to us as splashed. The coloured glaze is applied to the paste, and by regulating, during the process of baking, the currents of air admitted, the tints on a vase may be modified almost indefinitely.\n\n**Modern Period, from 1796.**\n\nThis is a period of decadence, and though many beautiful pieces were turned out during the reigns of Chia-Ch'ing and Tao-Kwang, especially for use in the palace at Peking, it hardly demands detailed description.\nNotes on Chinese Porcelain\n\nCHINESE PORCELAIN IN EUROPE.\n\nThe adoption of the word \"china\" into the English language as equivalent to porcelain is the best of evidence that it was from China that porcelain first came to England. Chinese porcelain began to be imported into Europe towards the end of the 15th century. When it first became known it aroused universal admiration and wonder. Compared with it, the pottery of England and of the continent of Europe was at a vast disadvantage. The first pieces to reach Europe were celadons and blue and white. They were either brought by travellers as precious curiosities or were presents acquired by ambassadors, and in almost every case were deemed worthy of a mount in the best art of the jewellers of the period. The prices which Chinese porcelain commanded soon stimulated amongst European potters an ambition to produce something like it, but, as there was no kaolin to be had, it was a long time before success crowned their efforts. As soon, however, as they were able to supply the market, the importations from China fell off and finally ceased altogether. While it lasted the trade was a very busy one, whole fleets of ships arriving in Europe laden with nothing else, a considerable proportion of the ware being made to order in China from European designs.\n\nHOW TO DISTINGUISH OLD CHINA.\n\nWe have now completed our survey of what might be called the rise and fall of the ceramic art in China. A few remarks in conclusion on the methods by which an expert is able to distinguish an old piece from a new one, and to tell exactly the period to which a piece belongs, may perhaps be of interest. In deciding as to the age of a piece, the composition of the paste and the condition\nChinese Porcelain\n\nof the glaze are perhaps the best test. As we have already remarked, a practised eye is able to judge the age of a piece more or less by its appearance. A Ming piece may perhaps look old to anyone, but it is only an expert who can observe the effect of age on a well preserved Kang-Hsi or Ch'ien-Lung vase. His next best guide is the colour, a particular shade denoting as a rule a particular period. In a polychrome piece he will observe carefully whether certain colours are under or over the glaze. He will always look, too, at the foot of a piece, for though there may be no date mark, the finish here is frequently an indication of the period. A celadon piece, for instance, made during the Ming Dynasty has always a red ring at its back, the unglazed surface where the piece has rested on the kiln. The foot of a Yung-Cheng piece, of the monochrome class in particular, is as a rule unglazed, a characteristic rarely seen in Kang-Hsi and Ch'ien Lung pieces, though occasionally in Ming ware. A date mark, especially when in the seal character, is generally, but by no means always, a guide to the age of a piece. One of the most familiar marks seen on old porcelain, particularly on pieces made for the foreign market, is that of the reign of Ch'eng-Hua (1465-1487), one of the Ming emperors, yet it is very rarely indeed that a piece bearing this mark is of an earlier date than the Kang-Hsi Period. The Chinese have always been lovers of antique porcelain, and they assumed, no doubt, that their European customers would value their productions all the more if they antedated them a century or so. Collectors consequently pay little attention to marks, taking a piece on its merits, whether marked or not. Modern imitations of old porcelain naturally abound, but it is only, as a rule, in the very rare and expensive classes that the reproductions are so excellent and so minute as to details that even an expert may occasionally be deceived. Of all the various classes of porcelain probably mono-\nNotes on Chinese Porcelain\n\nchromes are the most difficult to judge. It is in this class that the amateur most frequently comes to grief.\n\nFor any persons anxious to go more deeply into the subject than we have been able to in this pamphlet, there are many books on porcelain which will assist them in increasing their knowledge. For ourselves we must express our particular indebtedness to Dr. Bushell's \"Chinese Art\" and to Mr. Gulland's \"Chinese Porcelain,\" from both of which works we have quoted freely. Other useful books on the subject are the \"History and Description of Chinese Porcelain,\" by Cosmo Monkhouse, and \"How to Identify Old Chinese Porcelain,\" by Mrs. Willoughby Hodgson.\n\nF. E.

Pottery.\n\nHeight, 7 inches.\nPeriod, Han.\n\nFrom the collection of Taotai Hwang chung hwei.\nPLATE IV\n\nCup. Pottery, covered with a thick creamy-white dull glaze, known as \"Ta-Hee\" ware, said by the Chinese to be one of the first attempts to produce white vessels of pottery; made in Szechuan; mentioned in Tu-foo's book on T'ang pottery, volume 12. This cup is said to have been in the possession of one family since the Sung Dynasty, say 650 years.\n\nHeight, 2\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) inches.\nDiameter, 4\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) inches.\nPeriod, T'ang.\n\nDish.

Pottery, a brown speckled glaze covering body and upper part of vase, lower parts being unglazed with twelve heads in high relief of animals of the Signs of the Zodiac, and inscriptions, under their respective heads, of each month of the year.

Pottery, covered with a cream-buff crackle glaze inclined to green in parts, surrounded with modelled figures and dragons in high relief, surmounted by covers with birds. These urns were excavated within the last two years, somewhere in Szechuan, Kansu or adjacent provinces, and though indifferent specimens are to be procured, perfect specimens in pairs with original covers, and the subjects of decoration in high relief and good glazes, are very rare. Opinions differ as to age, but all are agreed that they are earlier than the Ming period. The author places the period at the Sung Dynasty.\n\nHeight, 27 inches.\nPeriod, Sung.\n\nNow in the possession of John St. Audley.\nPLATE VII\n\nJar. Pottery, believed to be of an age before the Sung period, covered with a creamy glaze and decorations in sepia of grotesque figures and trees, with characters denoting a poem.

Oblong hexagonal, with indented edge. Blue-purple glaze over brown. Clair-de-lune class. This is known as the early Sung porcelain, and the deep purple and other colours have a charm of their own: much prized by Chinese and Japanese connoisseurs, who pay high prices for good and perfect specimens.\n\nHeight, 2\u00bd inches.\nLength, 8 inches.\nPeriod, Sung.\n\nJar. Oviform, with curved lip, apple green crackled. The quality of the glaze is exceedingly good, and this is a valuable specimen of the apple green class, so popular with Chinese and American collectors.\n\nHeight, 6 inches.\nPeriod, Ming.\n\nDish. Round in curved sections, indented and concave edge. Blue-purple glaze over brown. Clair-de-lune class.\n\nHeight, 3 inches.\nLength, 9 inches.\nPeriod, Sung.\n\nFrom the collection of Bon ian zung.\nPLATE X\n\n**Vase.** Bottle shape, blue under-glaze decoration, with flowers and other ornamentation in two shades of red.\n\n*Mark,* blue seal.\n\n*Height,* 8\u00bd inches.\n\n*Period,* Ch'ien-Lung.\n\n**Bottle.** With long neck, soft paste, blue and white, fine crackle, creamy white and fine blue decoration of vases, screen, peacock-feathers, etc.\n\n*Mark,* double ring.\n\n*Height,* 5 inches.\n\n*Period,* Kang-Hsi.\n\n**Vase.** Double gourd shape, five colour decoration of dragon, phoenix and peony.\n\n*Height,* 8\u00be inches.\n\n*Period,* Yung-Cheng.\n\n**Boat.** With child seated inside, white soft paste, and incised key-pattern border round edge\n\n*Height,* 2 inches.\n\n*Length,* 7 inches.\n\n*Period,* Sung.\n\n*From the collection of Wong kai zur.*\nPLATE XI\n\nRock. Said to be excavated during the Sung Dynasty; shape is called \"The Curling Clouds,\" and is extraordinary and rare, the usual size being about the size of a fist. Much appreciated by Chinese collectors, and high prices are paid for similar articles. This specimen is said to be famous all over the Empire. The weight is heavy, and stone resembles iron-ore.\n\nHeight, 2 feet 8 inches.\nPeriod, Sung.\n\nFrom the collection of Zee kwan yin.\nIncense Burner or Bowl. Pottery covered with a green-tint glaze all over the body and base, and a kind of ripe-peach red bursting out in large patches and various size spots on part of the surface. The inside is only partially glazed to about half an inch from the rim, whilst the unglazed portion shows a brown-red pottery of apparently Sung origin. This specimen closely resembles the high priced and much admired peach bloom of the Kang-Hsi period, and is probably the result of the firing process used for the later product.\n\nHeight, 3\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) inches.\nPeriod, Sung.\n\nNow in the possession of Charles L. Freer.\nPair of Vases, with high neck spreading to flanged rim, under which are animal-head handles with loose rings of the superfine quality soft paste or \"Fen-Ting,\" and covered with a brilliant glaze of a creamy tint. It is crackled in a most extraordinary way from the rim to the shoulder. The crackles decrease in size from the centre of the neck to the body, but again broaden towards the base; the quality of the crackle, which is even on the loose rings, is a point of great attraction. Under the glaze are deep and striking incised designs of dragon and flying phoenix, with formal patterns on neck and near base. Centre under the base is also glazed and crackled, with unglazed surface around. The Chinese connoisseurs prize the soft paste or \"Fen-Ting\" even above the famous peach bloom, apple green, or heavenly blue. These vases have the same weight as egg-shell porcelain. Chinese authorities are inclined to place the period at Sung, but the author is of opinion that the articles are of early Ming production.\n\nHeight, 7\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) inches.\nPeriod, early Ming.\n\nFrom the collection of A. W. Bahr.\nPLATE XIV\n\nVase, Blanc-de-chine. Of the very best shade of slightly pink glaze thickly coated over translucent porcelain. Neck has various floral designs and symbols in relief, and the body has similar patterns incised in paste under glaze, the whole producing a very attractive appearance. This class of porcelain, from the purity of paste and charm of various shades of white, pink, and cream, will undoubtedly increase in popularity at no distant date, and one has only to view a well displayed collection of this ware to be fascinated with its subtle charm.\n\nHeight, 14 inches.\nPeriod, early Ming.\n\nFrom the collection of A. W. Bahr.\nPLATE XV\n\nFigure of the Goddess Kuan-Yin, standing on a pedestal, exquisitely modelled and covered with a rich creamy glaze, Blanc-de-chine. These good pieces of Blanc-de-chine are now much sought after by Chinese collectors, and are difficult to procure.\n\nHeight, 14 inches.\nPeriod, early Ming.\n\nFrom the collection of A. W. Bahr.\nPLATE XVI\n\nVase, with wide neck, Blanc-de-chine.\nHeight, 6\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) inches.\nPeriod, early Ming.\n\nVase, with wide base, lizard coiled round shoulder, Blanc-de-chine, of exquisite colour in subdued cream-pink translucent porcelain; a charming little piece.\nHeight, 4\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) inches.\nPeriod, early Ming.\n\nVase, bottle shape, Blanc-de-chine, floral pattern modelled in paste.\nHeight, 12\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) inches.\nPeriod, Kang-Hsi.\n\nPot on three feet, Blanc-de-chine, of exquisite colour and fine condition.\nHeight, 2\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) inches.\nPeriod, early Ming.\n\nVase, with long neck, around which a lizard is coiled, of the best colour of pink-cream. This specimen is well worthy of attention. At present Chinese and Japanese connoisseurs are keenly competing for this class.\nHeight, 8 inches.\nPeriod, early Ming.\n\nFrom the collection of L Grenard.\nPLATE XVII\n\n**Figure Standing on Waves**; the Priest that walked across the Yangtsze river on a reed, to escape from the pursuit of the enemy. According to legend, he was a deified Priest who had supernatural powers and was sent from heaven to deliver the South from the Northern aggressors. The Figure is of a cream-yellow tint, of Blanc-de-chine, and the expression on the face shows the high standard of the art of that period.\n\n*Height*, 5\u00bd inches.\n\n*Period*, early Ming.\n\n**Figure.** The God of Study or Literature, with head bent down in a thoughtful pose. The fine and deep lines that run through the whole figure make it very attractive and imposing. It is of the creamy white class of Blanc-de-chine.\n\n*Height*, 13 inches.\n\n*Period*, early Ming.\n\n**Statuette of the Goddess Kuan-Yin**, kneeling with a scroll in hand. It is of the pure white tint of Blanc-de-chine, and the perfect state, even to the finger tips, is worthy of attention.\n\n*Height*, 8 inches.\n\n*Period*, early Ming.\n\n*From the collection of A. W. Bahr.*\nPLATE XVIII\n\nPair of Teapots, with dragon handles and dragon spouts. One of the teapots is of a creamy pink tint, and the other of a yellow tint, both of Blanc-de-chine class. The purity of the porcelain is proved by its translucent qualities. The Blanc-de-chine manufactured in the Kang-Hsi period has a cold blue-white tinge and can be easily detected from that of Ming Blanc-de-chine, which has never been successfully imitated.\n\nHeight, 5 inches and $5\\frac{1}{2}$ inches.\nPeriod, early Ming.\n\nFrom the collection of A. W. Bahr.\nPLATE XIX\n\nKylin, Blanc-de-chine. This ware is known as the \"Fuchien White,\" and the translucency, on account of the purity of the material used, is greatly esteemed.\n\nHeight, pair, 8 inches; single, 10 inches.\n\nPeriod, early Ming.\n\nFrom the collection of A.

W. Bahr.\nPLATE XXV\n\nPair of Bowls, white Egg-shell of beautiful translucency; incised in the paste are designs representing various symbolic signs, with the mark in four archaic characters of Yung-Lo.

The crackle commences from the base and reaches about half-way up. The paste unquestionably approaches the soft paste quality, and is not the usual hard standard of this class of decorated porcelain; and from the colour and texture of the Famille verte enamels these jars show that five colour decoration on soft paste was probably commenced about the middle of the Kang-Hsi period.\n\nHeight, of Jars, 8 inches and 16 inches.\n\nPeriod, Kang-Hsi.\n\nFrom the collection of A. W. Bahr.\nPLATE LXV\n\n**Vase.** Square shaped and tapering. Famille verte, five colour. Decoration, interiors with figures very finely drawn, and with enamels of various shades of the five colours.

Decoration represents palace ladies, with long graceful robes, walking; chariot preceding attached to a Kylin; deer and rocks at back. The robes of the ladies are all of different coloured enamels, and the brilliancy of these enamels must be seen to be appreciated. These are very fine and rare bowls, as the exquisite miniature painting on them is not usually found in Famille verte pieces; it is more in accord with the quality of the Yung-Cheng artists than with the stronger and more brilliant enamels of the Kang-Hsi Famille verte. The painting is exceedingly minute.\n\nMarks, 6 characters, Ming mark, in double ring.\n\nHeight, $2\\frac{1}{2}$ inches.\n\nDiameter, $5\\frac{1}{2}$ inches.\n\nPeriod, Kang-Hsi.\n\nFrom the collections of D.

Decoration, large figures of ladies examining scrolls, playing chess, musical instruments, etc.; on shoulder are four medallions enclosing floral designs; on neck, rocks and bamboos are the principal decorations, with small key-pattern ground on side of rim. The enamel used in decoration of this piece is of the highest quality, and the black is particularly brilliant. This is probably a late production of this period.\n\nHeight, 17 inches.\nPeriod, Kang-Hsi.\n\nFrom the collection of Ho chun lee.\nPLATE LXX\n\nPlate. Famille verte, five colour.

W. Bahr.\nPLATE LXXI\n\nBowls. Famille verte, five colour. Decoration, agricultural and domestic scenes. The brilliant enamels used and the technique in the drawing are of high quality. The rich and beautiful enamels used during the middle part of the period of Kang-Hsi are all represented in their various tints to the best effect and advantage. It is said that the Emperor Kang-Hsi had a special liking for agricultural subjects, and accordingly ordered the best artists in the Imperial Pottery works to give particular attention to this class of decoration. The porcelain is hard and pure white, and there are no marks at the base. Inscription, explaining the subject in poetical terms, is written in gold characters on each bowl, with the seal of the artist and writer.\n\nHeight, 3\u00bd inches.\nDiameter, 7\u00bc inches.\nPeriod, Kang-Hsi.\n\nFrom the collection of A.

W. Bahr.\nPLATE LXXV\n\nPair of Plates. Famille verte, five colour. Celebrated as the Birthday plates, said to have been made to commemorate the sixtieth birthday of the Emperor Kang-Hsi. The decoration of pheasants, storks, peacocks and other birds, trees and flowers is all in the most perfect Chinese taste. The colouring, which is of a subdued tone, nevertheless excels in purity of enamels, and undoubtedly shows the excellence of the production of this period.\n\nBorder of these plates is decorated in fancy diaper designs, with four medallions containing the character \"Longevity.\"\n\nMarks, 6 characters in double ring.\nDiameter, 10 inches.\nPeriod, Kang-Hsi.\n\nFrom the collection of Ho chun lee.\nPLATE LXXVI\n\nDish.
