Mr. Joseph read the\u2014\n\nANNUAL REPORT FOR 1901.\n\nThe Council of the Ceylon Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society have the honour to submit the following Report for the year 1901:\n\nMEETINGS AND PAPERS.\n\nThe only General Meeting held during the year was the Annual General Meeting held on March 16, 1901. Papers which were expected, and which would have provided suitable material for General Meetings of the Society, have not been forthcoming.\nTwo important Papers have been accepted by the Society, viz., \"A Supplementary Paper on the Monumental Remains of the Dutch East India Company in Ceylon,\" by Mr. F. H. de Vos, which will form part of the Journal for 1901, and \"A Descriptive Catalogue of the more useful Trees and Flowering Plants of the Western and Sabaragamuwa Provinces of Ceylon,\" by Mr. F. Lewis, which will appear in the Journal of the current year.\n\nThe Council regret to have to report so serious a falling off in literary contributions from Members of the Society. They trust that the present year will show an improvement.\n\nMEMBERS.\n\nDuring the past year seven new Members were elected, viz., Messrs. M. K. Bamber; A. W. Andree; Professor W. E. Dyles; L. C. J. Doxat, A.M.I.C.E.; C. Jinarajadasa, B.A., M.R.A.S.; E. W. Perera, Advocate; J. C. Willis, M.A., F.L.S.\n\nFive Members resigned, viz., Sir A. C. Lawrie, Dr. J. Loos, Messrs. J. E. Addyman, E. C. Davies, and E. F. Hopkins, C.C.S.\n\nThe following names of Members were removed from the roll for not conforming to Rule 30, viz., P. B. Girihagama, T. B. Pohath, J. G. L. Ohlmu, and J. W. Seneviratne.\n\nMr. Staniforth Green has become a Non-Resident Life Member.\n\nThe Society now has on its roll 218 Members, including 23 Life Members, 10 Honorary Members, 146 Resident Members, and 39 Non-Resident Members.\n\nThe Council record with regret the death of the Rev. S. Coles, C.M.S., who had been a Member of the Society since 1869, and contributed a Paper on P\u00e1li Literature to the Society's Journal, Vol. IV., No. 15, 1865-70.\n\nLIBRARY.\n\nThe additions to the Library during the year, including parts of periodicals, numbered 341. The acquisitions were chiefly exchanges received from Societies. The Library is indebted for donations to the following:\u2014The Secretary of State for India; the Government of India; the Government of Madras; the Government of Bombay; the P\u00e1li Text Society; the Ceylon Government; Professor W. Geiger; Dr. W. G. Van Dort; Mr. C. Jinarajadasa, B.A.; the Postmaster-General; Sir A. C. Lawrie; Mr. J. Burgess; and Mr. V. B. Ketakar.\n\nBesides the institutions already on the exchange list, the Council have decided to exchange with the Korea Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society and the Techno-Chemical Laboratory of Bombay. Some other applications have been received, but on account of the large number of exchanges already on the Society's list, it has been thought advisable by the Council to decline acceding to them.\n\nThe Council has repeatedly drawn the attention of the Government to the want of accommodation in the Library and to its present congested condition. His Excellency the Governor, in reference to the question of inadequate accommodation for the Library and the proposed extension of the Museum, to which attention had been drawn by the Society, stated that he \"shares the regret of the Council of the Ceylon Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, that other more urgent claims on public moneys have prevented the provision of funds for...\"\nthe extension of the Museum.\u201d The Council will welcome with much relief any steps taken by the Government to provide additional accommodation. Although the Society has funds, it is unable to use them for books on account of want of room.\n\nJOURNALS.\n\nOne number of the Journal has been published during the year (Vol. XVI., No. 51, 1900). It contains, in addition to the Proceedings of the Council and the Annual General Meeting, the following Papers:\n\n(1) \u201cA Chapter in Ceylon History in 1630,\u201d by D. W. Ferguson.\n(2) \u201cContributions to Ceylon Malacology,\u201d by O. Collett, F.R.M.S.\n(3) \u201cJo\u00e3o Rodriguez de S\u00e1 e Menezes,\u201d by D. W. Ferguson.\n(4) \u201cPearl Oysters and Pearl Fisheries,\u201d by O. Collett, F.R.M.S.\n\nARCH\u00c6OLOGY.\n\nThe following is a synopsis of the work done by the Arch\u00e6ological Survey during 1901:\n\nMr. Dashwood, the Assistant to the Arch\u00e6ological Commissioner, after struggling for months against the malarial fever of the North-Central Province, had to leave the Island on furlough in May, in order to recruit his health. Subsequently he resigned his appointment; and for the last eight months of the year the Arch\u00e6ological Commissioner had, once more, to carry on the work of his Department single-handed. The conduct of the Arch\u00e6ological Survey has necessarily been again hampered, and its progress delayed, by the want of an Assistant during the greater part of 1901. Concurrent work at two sites was not feasible, as in 1900, during the dry months of last year. All work had to be suspended at Anur\u00e1dhapura whilst the Arch\u00e6ological Commissioner was engaged at Polonnaruwa between May and September.\n\nAnur\u00e1dhapura.\n\nRuwanv\u0113li area.\u2014Excavations were pushed on southward in the strip of the Ruwanv\u0113li area bordering the Basawakkulam tank, to the west of the Assistant Agent\u2019s and the Government Agent\u2019s residences and the Kachcheri.\n\nA small monastery with the customary quincunx arrangement of the main buildings (central vih\u0101re and four corner pirivenas) was fully freed of the earth on all sides so as to show up well from the Inner Circular road, which skirts it. The vih\u0101r\u00e9 is noticeable for its pair of N\u0101ga guard-stones and the ornamental balustrades of the steps.\n\nA little south of this monastery was laid bare the brick basement of some circular ruin (perhaps a wa\u1e6da-d\u0101-g\u00e9, \u201cround relic-house\u201d) surrounded by an outer wall, octagonal in outline, with an entrance passage on the east.\n\nRuins below Tis\u0101-v\u0113wa.\u2014Immediately below the embankment of Tis\u0101-v\u0113wa, and two to three hundred yards north of the Issurumuniya Rocks and temple, is a smaller line of boulders. The overhanging sides of these rocks were utilized as cave shelters, and their summits for superstructures; whilst at their foot, on the east, other buildings were erected.\nThe chief interest of this small group of ruins (now isolated, but formerly without doubt connected with Issurumuniya and the Vessagiri caves, situated still further south) lies in the two beautifully designed baths, with attached dressing-rooms (still in excellent preservation), built of dressed stone. The semi-arched recess, rock-cut, at the smaller bath is flanked on either side by realistic carvings in low relief of elephants emerging from a lotus pond.\n\nThese ruins (as do those of Vessagiriya and Issurumuniya) go back to the earliest days of ancient Anur\u00e1dhapura; though (as frequent elsewhere) they have suffered later alterations.\n\n*Mirisavetiya.*\u2014Commencement was made with the thorough excavation of the ruins surrounding the Mirisavetiya D\u00e1gaba. This area lies between the Anur\u00e1dhapura-Puttajam high road and Basawakkulam tank on the north.\n\nThe only building of importance unearthed so far is the chief *pirivena* of the Mirisavetiya Monastery. This is of the type of the similar oblong buildings known at Abhayagiriya, Th\u00fap\u00e1r\u00e1ma, and J\u00e9tawan\u00e1r\u00e1ma. Its proximity to the road and the modern town has unfortunately long bereft it of practically all but its monolithic columns.\n\nIt is likely that, though the area may not yield much of artistic value, the general plan of the ancient buildings and by-streets of the sacred precincts to Mirisavetiya will be disclosed with considerable certainty.\n\n**Sigiriya.**\n\nThe annual clearing of the ruins on the summit of Sigiri-gala\u2014of the terraces below the Rock north, west, and south\u2014and of the \u201cislands\u201d and caves within the enclosed area of the ancient city, was undertaken, as usual, during the early months of the year.\n\nLater, Sinhalese villagers were engaged in again clearing a certain portion (about one-third) of the city, on the west, which had become overgrown. Another portion will be cleared next year; and the remainder in 1903. The expense of clearing yearly the entire area of Sigiri-Nuwara, west and east of the Rock, is too great a tax upon a limited annual vote intended to meet the cost of all arch\u00e6ological work throughout the Island.\n\nThe rebuilding of the floor, steps, and wall of the gallery, at its north-west end, was completed to a point beyond which it is impracticable to carry masonry restoration. The standards and struts for the iron bridge designed to connect the western stretch of the gallery with the long flight of steps (which alone stands to mark its former continuation) along the north base of the rock, were also firmly fixed. Only the iron rails and flooring of the bridge remain to be adjusted and screwed down next year.\n\nFurther preliminary work was started last year, having for its ultimate object the permanent protection against birds, &c., of the unique frescoes in the Rock \u201cpockets.\u201d The carrying out of this eminently desirable work\u2014the due preservation of these ancient paintings\u2014involves very great difficulty, owing to the inaccessible and dangerous position of the \u201cpockets\u201d in the Rock cliff above the gallery, and the irregularity of their conformation. The completion of the task of effectually \u201ccaging in\u201d the frescoes of Sigiriya may occupy one or two seasons, all work in the \u201cpockets\u201d having to be suspended as soon as the south-west gale sets in.\nPolonnaruwa.\n\nAs in the previous year, operations were conducted at Polonnaruwa in 1901 under the personal supervision of the Archaeological Commissioner from May to September inclusive:\n\n(1) The ruins excavated in 1900 (\"Council Chamber,\" \"Audience Hall,\" &c.) standing on the promontory at T\u00f3p\u00e1-vewa, which had become overgrown, were first cleanly weeded.\n\n(2) Attention was next turned to the excavation of the \"Irrigation Work lying immediately below the tank,\" at which point digging had ceased the year before. This has proved to be a pokuna, or large pond, with rock bottom, supplied from T\u00f3p\u00e1-vewa by a sluice. The tank water was passed by three conduits (nalal), diagonally into a narrow brick \"well\" (bis\u00f3kotuwa); and thence, through a second similar \"silt trap,\" under the tank bund to the pond, along and over a paved spill, neatly finished. At the north side of this pokuna is an ornamented shower bath built of cut stone, fed from a spout above, which is apparently led through a circular walled room at a higher level from a \"water tower.\" The sides of the pokuna on the north and south are formed by high ground and rock; on the east the water was retained by a stout wall, in brick and mortar, bellying outwards.\n\nBeyond this convex wall is a small pond, rectangular in shape, connected with the pokuna by a single inlet, and discharging similarly into a channel (now obliterated), which probably carried the surplus water into low land to the south-east by a sluice (still traceable) under the south embankment of the promontory.\n\nThe level area through which this channel flowed, between the ruined buildings standing on the tank bund and the western wall of the citadel, is traditionally known as \"the King's Garden.\" Excavation has, here, distinctly tended to confirm tradition.\n\nThe spoil resulting from the heavy earth-cutting (at places 25 feet deep) at the pokuna and bis\u00f3kotu was advantageously used in forming a banked up cross road, much needed to unite the Government buildings near the tank bund with the new driving road from Minn\u00e9riya.\n\n(3) The \"pillared building close to the Irrigation Bungalow on the tank bund\" was also excavated. It is shown to be a vih\u00e1r\u00e9, with moulded brick basement, fronting east. A well-carved stone Buddha (headless and limbless) was exhumed inside the shrine.\n\n(4) The new road from Minn\u00e9riya under construction last year between the 25th and 26th miles, and about a mile from T\u00f3p\u00e1-vewa, exposed some pillared ruins. It seemed desirable, by dealing with this group promptly, to anticipate not improbable illicit digging by wayfarers and others. During September the labour force was moved to this site. The decision was amply repaid by results. The quadrangle of a Hind\u00fa d\u00e9v\u00e1l\u00e9 containing three or four shrines was followed out by trenching. The chief k\u00f3vil (a mound of fallen d\u00e9bris, but once domed like others at Polonnaruwa) yielded, inter alia, a finely-carved stone nandi (bull) and a lingam and y\u00f3ni, unbroken, in situ.\n\nOn the rock hummock adjoining the d\u00e9v\u00e1l\u00e9 premises was discovered a long Sinhalese inscription of forty-five lines, in good preservation. The record belongs to \"Siri Sa\u1e45gabo Ni\u015ba\u1e45ka Malla K\u00e1li\u1e45ga Par\u00e1krama B\u00e1hu.\"\n\nThere are more ruins around this rock, not improbably forming part of the entourage of the d\u00e9v\u00e1l\u00e9, which must have been of some note.\n(5) In addition to parking the promontory area, the gradual clearing of undergrowth at present hiding much of \"Pulasitipura\" was begun by a system of paid r\u0101jak\u0101riya, i.e., compulsory service for seven days of a limited number of adults from each village, remunerated by fair cash payment at the week's close. The Moor villagers of the Megoda Pattuwa of Tamanka\u1e0duwa, thus judiciously employed year by year, will gradually open out the whole of the old capital, with benefit alike to the Government and to themselves.\n\nCOUNCIL.\n\nSir A. C. Lawrie, one of the two Vice-Presidents, resigned the office and Membership of the Society on leaving the Island last year. Sir Archibald Lawrie has been a Member of the Society since 1879 and a Vice-President since 1895. He always evinced an active interest in the affairs of the Society, and your Council regret his severance from it. His knowledge of Ceylon History made him a most valuable Member of the Society and Council. Mr. John Ferguson was appointed by the Council to fill the vacancy caused by Sir Archibald Lawrie's retirement. Two Members of the Council of 1900, viz., Messrs. H. White and F. H. Modder, having been by virtue of Rule 16 deemed to have retired by least attendance, the vacancies caused by their retirement were filled by the appointment of the Hon. Mr. H. H. Cameron and Mr. C. Drieberg; the Hon. Mr. S. C. Obeyesekere was appointed in place of Mr. E. Booth, resigned.\n\nFINANCES.\n\nThe income of the year, exclusive of the commencing balance of Rs. 1,856\u00b796, was Rs. 1,832\u00b777. The expenditure amounted to Rs. 1,489\u00b763; and thus the sum in hand has increased by Rs. 343\u00b714, and stands at Rs. 2,200\u00b710.\n\nThe balance sheet is as follows:\u2014\nThe Royal Asiatic Society, Ceylon Branch.\u2014Statement of Accounts for the Year 1901.\n\n| RECEIPTS. | Rs. c. |\n|-----------|--------|\n| Balance on December 31, 1900 | ... 1,856 96 |\n| Entrance Fees | ... 31 50 |\n| Annual Subscriptions :\u2014 | Rs. c. |\n| 1897 | ... 31 50 |\n| 1898 | ... 47 25 |\n| 1899 | ... 147 0 |\n| 1900 | ... 309 75 |\n| 1901 | ... 592 70 |\n| 1902 | ... 62 25 |\n| Life Membership | ... 25 0 |\n| Government grant for 1901 | ... 500 0 |\n| Messrs.

His Lordship was about to vacate the Chair, but at the general request of those present consented to officiate for the remainder of the Meeting.\n\n5. On the motion of Dr. V. R. Saravanamuttu, and seconded by Dr. W. A. de Silva, the following Office-Bearers were elected for 1902:\n\nPresident.\u2014The Hon. Mr. Everard im Thurn, C.B., C.M.G.\n\nVice-Presidents.\u2014Mr. F. M. Mackwood and Mr. J. Ferguson.\n\nCouncil.\n\nMr. M. K. Bamber.  \nMr. S. M. Burrows, M.A., C.C.S.  \nMr. P. Coomaraswamy.  \nMr. C. Drieberg, B.A., F.H.S.  \nMr. C. M. Fernando.  \nMr. P.

Willis, M.A.\n\nHonorary Treasurer.\u2014Mr. F. C. Roles.\n\nHonorary Secretaries.\u2014Mr. H. C. P. Bell, C.C.S.; Mr. J. Harward, M.A.; and Mr. G. A. Joseph.\n\n6. Mr. F. Lewis, F.L.S., read portions of his Paper entitled \"A Descriptive Catalogue of the more useful Trees and Flowering Plants of the Western and Sabaragamuwa Provinces of Ceylon.\"\n\nSir W. W. Mitchell proposed a hearty vote of thanks to Mr. Lewis. He congratulated Mr. Lewis upon the Paper, which, he said, was a most useful record of the fauna of those two Provinces. He was sure they all wished that it had been possible for Mr. Lewis to have dealt with the other Provinces of Ceylon. As regards the other Provinces, and more especially those in the North, they could hope, now that the railway was being carried in that direction, that vast resources of timber would be imported from there, and that they might be less dependent upon countries such as Burma, Australia, and the Straits for supplies of timber. (Hear, hear.)\n\nMr. C. Drieberg seconded the resolution.\u2014Carried cordially.\n\nMr. J. Ferguson inquired whether any of the other valuable woods besides satinwood were found to any considerable extent in the two Provinces in question. He would like to know regarding ebony,\n\n* See page 89.\ncalamander, tamarind, &c., and whether it was true that the last calamander was found recently in that part of the Island.\n\nMr. Lewis thanked Sir W. W. Mitchell and the seconder of the resolution for their appreciation of his Paper. With regard to valuable trees, it was a curious fact that they regarded those trees as valuable from their acquaintance with furniture. (Laughter.) They were acquainted with satinwood, because they found satinwood tables and almirahs: they were acquainted also in that way with calamander, a very rare and exceedingly restricted plant. Tamarind they also knew as furniture; and besides they knew it for its medicinal qualities, as there was a medicinal drink made from it. Of other trees, such as ebony, they had a very considerable quantity in the Island; but in the two Provinces under consideration only a restricted area. It was a common error to say that it did not grow to a high altitude. It reached 3,000 feet, but only to a limited extent; and he did not say that it grew in such large quantities at high altitudes that they would be able to \"do a huge business\" in it.\n\nAs regards calamander, it was becoming almost extinct. He had the good fortune to be the original discoverer of the flower of the calamander tree in the Island. On finding that extremely rare thing\u2014his friends called it a monstrosity\u2014the P\u00e9radeniya people sent a man up the tree forthwith. (Laughter.) He had only found the flower of the calamander after searching for many years, and after offering a reward year after year. He did that because he was anxious to discover whether there was not some way of extending the growth of calamander; which, as the Members of the Society were no doubt aware, was indigenous to Ceylon, and found in no other part of the world. It was exceedingly uncommon, and the area of growth was restricted; indeed in an average map of Ceylon the area of growth would be covered by an ordinary postage stamp, and that in the wildest and most inaccessible parts, with long distances separating the male and female trees. It naturally followed that, where male and female were such long distances apart, the chances of getting seed were very remote; and, particularly, when they considered the fact that if anybody found a healthy tree, male or female, it was immediately cut down for the sake of its wood. He had been told that the calamander had been found in the dry zone, but he was sorry that he could not credit that as truth; because the result of his examination of what had been shown from the dry zone and the tree of the wet zone proved that there was as much comparison as there was between a cabbage and a mango. (Laughter).\n\nOf the other valuable plants of Ceylon, one that was insufficiently appreciated in the country was palu (*Mimusops hexandra*). Roughly speaking, in the dry zone that plant should be found over two-thirds of the area, and the day would come when it would receive its full appreciation. Palu necessitated proper machinery for cutting it up, as it was an exceedingly hard timber to deal with. Palu was very valuable. As regards other woods, there was a very large quantity of those woods mostly known as jakwood; but that, as a domestic plant the fruit of which was so largely consumed by the natives, was in no danger of being exterminated. But as regards calamander, he thought they were running the risk of its complete extinction. (Applause.)\nMr. Ferguson asked for supplementary information. Would Mr. Lewis tell them what uses palu could be put to and what foreign woods would be superseded, whether those of Western Australia, Burma, or Borneo?\n\nMr. Lewis said he thought palu would hardly supersede those trees; and there were two reasons why. The one was the intense difficulty there was in working palu, and the other was the ease with which those hard woods from Australia and Borneo were at present brought to Ceylon. Palu was extremely hard and sticky, and the average sawyer objected to sawing it, because he found that his saws stuck in the wood.\n\nMr. Coomaraswamy, referring to the alleged medicinal properties of the tamarind, said it was accepted among natives of the country that to sleep under a tamarind tree was to get sufficient ague into the system to last any one for a lifetime! Among natives tamarind was entirely prohibited when any one was undergoing a course of medicine.\n\nFarewell to the President.\n\n7. Mr. John Ferguson, Vice-President, proposed the following Resolution:\n\n\"That the Council and Members of the Ceylon Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society desire to place on record their special sense of indebtedness to the Right Rev. Dr. Copleston, Bishop of Colombo, Metropolitan-Elect of India, &c., for the very valuable services he has rendered to the Society during the past twenty years, for the learned Papers he has edited in its Journals, and for the instructive Addresses he has given from time to time as its President, an office he has held with great acceptance for seventeen years. That, in now bidding His Lordship farewell, the Council and Members express the earnest hope that he may be long spared in good health in the new and very important sphere to which he has been called.\"\n\nMr. Ferguson said that at the Jubilee celebration of that Branch in December, 1895, at which their now retiring President prepared and read an admirable r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the history of the Society, he (Mr. Ferguson) ventured to remark that no one had done so much, attracted so much public interest in, and increased the prosperity of, the Ceylon Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society as the Bishop of Colombo had done, and that, indeed, he had done more for their Institution than any other Member had during its history of fifty years. (Applause.) He saw no reason to modify that opinion, because His Lordship had been a tower of strength to them during the past six or seven years, and during a long period before that Jubilee celebration.\n\nThey had profited by the prestige appertaining to the Bishop as a learned man, for he was one of whom they might say in the words of the poet: \"He is a scholar, and a right good one.\" (Applause.) As an accomplished linguist and learned Orientalist there were few, if any, in the Island to compare with His Lordship, and he was tempted to illustrate that by remarking on a piece of work outside of the scope of that Society, but which he might be pardoned for introducing as an\nillustration. Dr. Copleston's consummate acquaintance with the Sinhalese language was at that moment placing the Committee of the Local Auxiliary of the Bible Society at their wits' end, as to where they were to get one to continue the Bishop's revision of the Bible in Sinhalese. (Applause.) They, as Members of that Society, were well acquainted with their learned President's work in regard to the J\u0101takas, fifty of which he had edited for the Journals of that Society\u2014a work and undertaking which excited the liveliest interest among scholars in Europe.\n\nThen, again, they had their President's work on Buddhism, primitive and present, published in 1892, and considered by reliable and competent authorities to be the best work on the subject\u2014a work which had been made so popular as to be interesting to the general reader, and so accurate as to be of great value to the scholar. That work corrected and criticized previous learned writers, and presented them with a true picture of Buddhism as it was in their midst, and to write it a thorough acquaintance with Oriental and Buddhistical literature was necessary. They had a standard work of which they were all proud; and especially the Members of the Society ought to be proud of the fact that the Bishop was their President at the time of its publication. (Applause.)\n\nSince 1882, Dr. Copleston had been a Member of the Society, and since 1886 he had been President. It was inevitable that there should be sadness connected in parting. It was difficult always to say farewell, and still more difficult was it to convey the thoughts connected with that feeling. But there were two redeeming features on that occasion: first, that they were fortunate enough to have as His Lordship's successor an accomplished and able Scientist in their Lieutenant-Governor and Colonial Secretary, Mr. im Thurn; and secondly, that the Bishop, the Metropolitan, was not bidding a final farewell to Ceylon, but that he had an ecclesiastical connection with the Island which would justify (what he felt sure was Dr. Copleston's personal desire) visits to Ceylon from time to time; and that he would continue to maintain a warm and continuous interest in the progress and elevation and moral advancement of the people of the Island, and not least in the work of the Ceylon Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society.\n\nHe had endeavoured to express, to use the words of the Bishop himself on a somewhat similar occasion, \"a sense of real gratitude and sincere regret,\"\u2014gratitude because of valuable services prolonged over a period of twenty years,\u2014and regret because when their President left the Chair that evening he would vacate the position which he had filled for a long period past to their great advantage and great benefit. Long might His Lordship continue in the important office to which he had been called. (Applause.)\n\nMr. Coom\u0101rasw\u0101my seconded, and said he bore loyal testimony to the great untiring work that the Bishop had performed.\n\nThe Hon. Mr. Obeye Sekere supported, and said that, speaking as a Sinhalese, he could hardly express the regret which the community felt at severance from His Lordship. The opinion savants had of the Bishop's literary abilities was well voiced by the well-known scholar Batuwantudawa Pundit, who said that he had learnt a great deal more from His Lordship than he was in a position to impart. (Hear, hear.)\nMr. P. E. Morgappah supported the motion on behalf of the Tamil community.\n\nMr. F. M. Mackwood, before putting the Resolution to the Meeting, said he thought they all realized that the words which had fallen from the speakers were not mere lip language, but that they had come from the hearts of all of them and appealed to the hearts of all of them. They were realizing what happened to them often in life. They possessed much that they valued; but it was only when they came to losing that they appreciated the full and real value of what they possessed. They were now losing that which they had always known to be of service and of great value, but never of the service, and of the value which they now realized that it had been. (Applause.) There was no need for him to say more. The things that welled from the heart could never be fully and adequately expressed in words. He put the Resolution to the Meeting.\n\nThe Resolution having been unanimously approved, Mr. Mackwood presented it to His Lordship the Bishop.\n\n8. His Lordship the Bishop in reply, said:\u2014Mr. Ferguson, ladies, and gentlemen,\u2014I will not claim any such privilege as might entitle me to meet this kind resolution by a mere brief statement of my gratitude. I know that you expect me to say something in reply to it, although, in attempting to do so, I find myself in a novel position. For so long a time my experience has been that of one who bids farewell to others, and proposes, or puts to the vote, resolutions on their departure, that I have got into the habit of regarding myself as a sort of professional sender-off of other people. (Laughter.) At last my own turn has come; and I find myself upon the other side to receive these kind expressions, to feel how unworthy I am of the generous recognition which my little services have met with, and to express this difficulty of speaking where one\u2019s feelings are deepest. What might have been only an ordinary compliment has been raised, I think, this evening, by the language of those who have proposed it, and especially by that of my friend, Mr. Ferguson, into something very much more than that,\u2014into a touching and most welcome expression of friendship and of kindness. (Hear, hear.) And therefore, I think that I am meeting something more than a recognition of speeches made, or Papers read, or Resolutions published within the Meetings of this Society.\n\nI welcome the expression \u201cfriendship,\u201d which has been cemented by each Meeting here and by our co-operation in the Meetings of the Council, and in our social Meetings on occasions of our more learned Papers here. (Hear, hear.) I cannot feel that my services have deserved, from any point of view, any large fraction of the tribute that has been paid to me. I am afraid that many years have passed since I have done anything out of my own resources to add to the learning of any Member of the Society; nor have I succeeded in stirring up much enthusiasm, nor in eliciting many Papers from others. One of those who supported this Resolution described me as having been on one occasion a President looking for a quorum, and I am sorry to say that I have been for a long time a President looking for a Paper, or at any rate, for more than a very few. (Laughter.)\nMy good friend Mr. Lewis has come to the rescue this evening, and before. (Hear, hear.) But, if it had not been for him and one or two others, a very sorry record, I am afraid, of the advancement of learning would have characterized the period of my Presidency\u2014at any rate, of these latter years, since we lost some of those who formerly adorned the Society. But I think we have certainly not done as a learned Society all that we might have expected of one another during the last seven or eight years. We have met in social and friendly intercourse; and we have\u2014I at least have\u2014learnt how much kindness and tolerance and how great readiness to make the most even of our small efforts characterizes those who gather within these walls.\n\nIt has been particularly gratifying to me to-day that this most kind Resolution should have been proposed by my friend Mr. Ferguson, for whom and for whose family I have had during the time of my life in Ceylon an ever-increasing regard. There are reasons which make me particularly pleased to think that Mr. A. M. Ferguson, if he had been here this evening, would either have proposed, or supported, this Resolution with no less kindness and warmth than his successor has done. (Applause.) And I am extremely grateful,\u2014although I feel how far it goes beyond that, for nothing but generosity could justify the esteem which Mr. Ferguson has set before you of my services or of my abilities.\n\nI am going away from the country in which I have lived, and worked (so far as I have worked), and joyed, and I have very greatly enjoyed, during these twenty-six years; and of course, as I have heard it lately said,\u2014I think it was said the other day by His Excellency the Governor,\u2014this country manages to lay a grip upon the affections and interest of those who are even in it for a comparatively short time. How much more must it have laid its grip on my heart, and how much more sure is it that it has secured affections which can never cease to be warm to this country and to those who are in it. (Applause.) I cannot hold out any expectations that I (who, during the last six or eight years of my time here, when I had upon me the responsibility of President of this Society, could not manage, I am afraid, to contribute anything) of being able to send many contributions when I have gone away to such a great distance. But, on the other hand, I shall find there the advantage of these studies which I have made here, and which the Society has done a great deal to encourage me in. It will be a very great help to me that these years have been passed in a country where, to a great extent, the customs, or many of the customs, date back very far, and are identical to those which are spread out through the North of India, where the language is akin, closely akin, to some of those which will be spoken in the country I am going to. To have served here has been a preparation for that which awaits me.\n\nYou know, of course, and it has been already noticed, that I have a particular interest in languages; and I am to some extent already equipped by what I have acquired here for the work to which I am going. Not only shall I find it my duty to use to some extent the Tamil language\u2014the Tamils are ubiquitous, wherever they go they are full of energy and forward in education, and I shall have to minister sometimes in Tamil in the country to which I am going\u2014I shall find within that great district which will form my Diocese of the great Sanskrit languages,\nHindi, Bengali, and Oriya, of which the Bengali, at any rate, is very closely allied to the Sinhalese. Any one who knows fairly the higher Sinhalese, and something of Sanskrit, will find it perfectly easy to read Bengali, although he may find it impossible to pronounce a Bengali book. Then there are two other languages of that group which are of a somewhat more corrupt type I think\u2014the Assamese and the Cachari, which will come very much within my scope to learn. There are two other languages of a known literary type, the Rajmahali, which is in some degree akin to the Tamil; and the Santalri, a very curious language, and still more remote from the Aryan type, spoken by some hill tribes, among whom there are a great number of Christians. Besides these people, there are on the boundaries of Sikkim and Nep\u00e1l a number of Lepchi and other dialects of which I know nothing, and of which I suppose I shall never be able to learn much.\n\nYou will see that I have before me a field for which I am not altogether unprepared by the life which I have had here, and by the studies which we have encouraged one another in pursuing; so that it is almost certain, although I am not able to afford you any contributions, I shall often be made to think of what is going on here, and shall be constantly comparing\u2014I suppose at first always to the advantage of Ceylon, then after a little time with an impartial mind, and, if I live long enough, eventually with great favour to Bengal\u2014the way in which the same words and the same forms of syntax are represented in the languages of the two different countries. At present it is with a shudder that I hear the way in which they pronounce their words in Bengal. It was as though they had got hold of a Sanskrit word, which they know how to write but not to pronounce; and I am afraid my great difficulty for some time to come will be to avoid pronouncing words common to the two languages in the way we favour here. All these languages, however, mean that there will remain for me a very close bond with what I have left, but which I shall not have altogether left; and I shall look forward to returning and meeting those who have parted from me with so much kindness during the last few days, and in particular you who have paid me this high compliment this evening. (Applause.)\n\n9.

The pink indicates plantations, chiefly in European hands, while the green gives forest areas. Uncoloured portions represent lands in native and European hands, mostly the former, and very largely planted with cocoanuts. Roman figures indicate altitude in feet above sea level, while italic figures give the rainfall in inches per annum.\n\nIn introducing my Paper to the Ceylon Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, on the more useful trees and flowering plants of the Western and Sabaragamuwa Provinces, it is desirable to set out a description of that portion of Ceylon within which the plants treated of are to be found.\n\nIt is, moreover, as well to be acquainted with not only a brief geographical description, but the physical conditions and climate, in order that it may become apparent that the Provinces under consideration may be taken as very nearly representative of the whole Island, showing that the subject-matter dealt with applies to even a larger extent of country than comes within the scope of the title of this Paper.\n\nThe area of the Western and Sabaragamuwa Provinces amounts to 3,333 square miles, made up as follows:\u2014\nThe boundaries of the country thus represented may be described as follows. Starting with the mouth of the Mah\u00e1-oya on the north, the boundary follows the course of this stream to a point about two miles to the east of Polgahav\u00e9la railway station, whence it proceeds along the borders of the North-Western Province to Pettaragalla estate, and thence over Alagalla Peak and the old planting district of Kadugann\u00e1wa to Gonadika estate in Dolosb\u00e1g\u00e9. On the east the Central Province boundary is skirted in Dolosb\u00e1g\u00e9 in a rather broken line to as far as Mudamana estate in the Kitulgalla Valley, where the boundary crosses the Kelani river and strikes the crest of hills overlooking the Kehelgama Valley, touching in its course the steep point forming Kiripanagalla, and thence along a sharp ridge of hills to Adam\u2019s Peak, after which the main mountain zone of the Island is followed, skirting Maskeliya, Bogawantal\u00e1wa, and Dimbula planting districts over some of our highest peaks till To\u1e6dapola is reached. At this point a sharp turn to the east is made when the \u00dava boundary is touched, after which the line follows southwards to the Walawe river, and along that fine stream to Liyangahato\u1e6da, not far from Hambanto\u1e6da.\n\nFrom Liyangahato\u1e6da the boundary is rather arbitrary till the fine range of hills overlooking the Morawak K\u00f3ral\u00e9 is touched, after which it crosses the valley of the Gin-ganga at the Ulinduw\u00e1wa village, and thence in an undulating line turning southwards to the well-known Hinidum-kanda (\u201cHaycock\u201d) overlooking the Galle District.\nFrom here the line passes on over very broken country to the head waters of the Bentota river, and along that waterway to the sea, which last forms the western limit.\n\nWithin this wide sweep of embracing line is included a number of large rivers, viz., the Kelani-ganga for a little more than half its length, together with its most important tributaries, the Mah\u00e1-oya, the whole of the Kalu-ganga and its branches, nearly the whole of the Walawe-ganga, and the Bentota river, not to mention the Attanagalla-oya and several large tributaries of the rivers already enumerated.\n\nThe altitudes reached extend from sea level to over 7,000 feet, and consequently the variation of temperature ranges from the burning heat of the south to often below freezing point at the Horton Plains.\n\nThe greatest change, however, is to be found in the difference of rainfall. This at the lowest is about 45 inches a year on the south-east limits of the Ratnapura District, after which all gradations of humidity are passed, culminating in a rainfall closely approximating 300 inches in a year in the valley of the Kalu-ganga to the north-west of Ratnapura.\n\nThe following points may be mentioned as indicating the wide range of rainfall:\n\n| Altitude. | Mean Rainfall. |\n|-----------|---------------|\n| Feet.     | Inches.       |\n| Colombo   | Sea level     | 88\u00b731         |\n| Negombo   | Sea level     | 67\u00b752         |\n| Kalutara  | Sea level     | 86\u00b762         |\n| Labugama  | 375           | 161\u00b750        |\n| Rayigam   | 400           | 165\u00b788        |\n| Henaratgoda Gardens | 33 | 97\u00b785 |\n| Veyangoda | 300           | 97\u00b719         |\n| Gikyanakanda | 200 | 151\u00b793 |\n| Avissawella | 105 | 131\u00b780 |\n| Dunedin   | 400           | 180\u00b753        |\n| Sembawatta | 1,600 | 218\u00b756 |\n| Padupola  | 1,636         | 230\u00b785        |\n| Ratnapura | 84            | 150\u00b710        |\n| Pelmadulla | 408 | 142\u00b770 |\n| Aberfoyle | 3,300         | 129\u00b752        |\nAltitude. Mean Rainfall.\nFeet.

Here prolonged droughts are of yearly occurrence, and the corresponding forms of vegetation are conspicuous, such as Palu (Mimusops hexandra), Satinwood (Chloroxylon Swietenia), Diwul (Feronia elephantum), Crat\u00e6va Roxburghii, Gyrocarpus Jacquinii, Cassia Fistula, and numbers of other typically dry zone trees.\n\nOn the other hand, the wettest parts of the country lie close to and around the base of Adam's Peak. Here a drought of ten days without rain is unusual, and consequently the vegetation is chiefly composed of soft wood and abundance of bamboos and grasses.\n\nThe soil of the Province is also very variable as regards its quality and depth. The best and richest soil is undoubtedly coincident with the dry zone, but there are several valleys beside in which a rich soil is present, as, for instance, in the valley of the Mah\u00e1-oya, the valley of the Ritigaha-oya, and the valley of the Rakw\u00e1na-ganga.\n\nPoor sandy soil, however, represents by far the larger area of either Province, even to a fairly high altitude, but it is\nworthy of remark that size of timber or density in no way follows a rich soil, as, for example, one of the finest forests in Sabaragamuwa is in a poor sandy soil, constantly bathed with heavy rains, and possessing no special shelter from the wind.\n\nParts of the Ratnapura District might be described as patana country and grass land, the locality most conspicuous for this change in the vegetation being to the north and east of the Walawe river after it breaks away from the great forest basin extending from Bambarabotuwa to Detenagalla mountain.\n\nA typical patana country within Sabaragamuwa is represented by the beautiful Horton Plains that are at the head waters of the Bilihul-oya at an altitude of about 7,000 feet above the sea. Lower down, to the east and south-east of Balangoda, the true grass country is more pronounced, with its typical forms of trees, such as Careya arborea, Phyllanthus Emblica, and Terminalia Chebula, till it blends with the dry zone areas on the one side, or the intermediate zone, as the case may be.\n\nMost of the original vegetation of the country has been cleared away by human agency, so that it is now impossible to trace what at one time was the limit of the forests covering the two great Provinces under review. The vast extent of cocoanut land, followed by land in tea, and these enormously supplemented by what is called \"chena land,\" has taken up probably fully two-thirds of both Provinces, so that anything like a continuous area of unbroken timber land is not to be found. Several very large forests still exist, notably the wilderness of the Peak, but large as these are they can now only form a fraction of what must have existed in ancient times. Of the large forests still remaining, we have the Sinha Raja extending in a very broken form through the Pasdun Koral\u00e9 in the Kalutara District into the Kukulu Koral\u00e9 in Sabaragamuwa, the Peak wilderness and the great belt on the south of the Peak to Totapola range, the Panilla and Illambekanda forests,\nthe Labugama forests, and many smaller forest areas scattered like islands in a sea of more or less private property.\n\nThe action of mankind in changing the aspect of the vegetation of the country can best be seen by a glance at the accompanying maps of the four districts involved, the area still in forest being tinted green. It is therefore readily understood that contrasts in typical forms are many, while, on the other hand, instances often occur where dry zone plants are found in wet forests, and occasionally vice versa.\n\nOften a single Order may be found to have representatives in both extremes of climate, as, for example, Ebony, which is usually a dry zone form. Again, in the Rubiaceae we find examples not only in extremes of climate range, but also at the lowest and highest altitudes.\n\nNotwithstanding all these conflicting forces tending to bring about a general mixing up of all species all over the country, there still remains a distinct outline of specific characteristic to differentiate the flora of the wet from the dry zone, or these separately from the intermediate zone, while montane flora separates itself into a readily recognized position differing from all others.\n\nGenerally speaking, none of the forests of the Provinces under consideration possess any one dominant species, that is to say, no one forest is made up of one kind. Several gregarious species exist, most especially so in members of the Dipterocarp Order, as, for instance, Dipterocarpus zeylanicus, or Doona congestiflora, or Doona Gardneri, but the area over which they may be regarded as predominant is usually small.\n\nA curious example of gregariousness and restriction is to be found in a portion of the Bambarabotuwa forest to the north-east of Ratnapura, where Aridda (Campnosperma zeylanicum)\u2014one of the Anacardiace\u00e6\u2014all but takes up the whole vegetation. In the dry forests Satinwood is nearly as plentiful. In undergrowth several forms of Strobilanthes assume a sub-gregarious nature, as also might be said of certain of the Mangroves.\nTaking the zones, therefore, in the following order, as arid, dry, intermediate, wet, montane, and grass, the corresponding typical forms may be given as characteristic:\n\n(a) Arid Zone.\u2014Salvadora persica, Randia dumetorum, and Tribulus terrestris.\n\n(b) Dry Zone.\u2014Crataeva Roxburghii, Cassia Fistula, Acacia leucophloea, Satinwood, Mimusops hexandra, Hemicyclia sepiaria, and Strychnos Nux-vomica.\n\n(c) Intermediate Zone.\u2014Albizzia odoratissima, Holoptelea integrifolia, Tetrameles nudiflora, Ficus Arnottiana, and Berrya Ammonilla.\n\n(d) Wet Zone.\u2014Wormia triquetra, Schumacheria castaneaefolia, Cyathocalyx zeylanicus, Garcinia terpnophylla, Calophyllum bracteatum, Vateria acuminata, Elaeocarpus serratus, Hydrocera triflora, Evodia Roxburghiana, Kokoona zeylanica, Leea sambucina, Campnosperma zeylanicum, Pericopsis Mooniana, Anisophyllea zeylanica, Barringtonia racemosa, Hedyotis fruticosa, Schizostigma hirsutum, Palaquium petiolare, Diospyros Gardneri, and Machilus, besides many less conspicuous examples, of which very many are Rubiaceous.\n\n(e) Montane Zone.\u2014Michelia nilagirica, Berberis asiatica, Hypericum mysorense, Calophyllum Walkeri, Gordonia zeylanica, Elaeocarpus montanus, Rhodomyrtus tomentosa, Kendrickia Walkeri, Hedyotis Lessertiana, H. verticillaris, and Rhododendron arboreum may be taken as typical forms.\n\nLastly (f) the Grass Land Flora, which, as the name implies, is mainly composed of many species of grasses, yet possesses certain very distinct tree forms, such as Careya arborea, Phyllanthus Emblica, Anogeissus latifolia, and many small leguminous plants too numerous to mention.\n\nThe flora of our hill tops is one of special interest, and might be regarded in certain cases as very remarkable, but it is hardly within the scope of this Paper to enlarge on the complex questions such distribution would entail, as a\ngeneral description and not specific is what is here aimed at, though very imperfectly.\n\nI have added a few notes from Dr. Trimen's monumental work on \"The Flora of Ceylon,\" respecting species or distribution of the same outside the limits of country I have confined myself to. This addition will add completeness to my catalogue; but it is impossible to make the Paper as full as the subject demands without vastly extending the bulk of the Paper itself.\n\nMy obligations are due to the Director of the Royal Botanic Gardens at P\u00e9rad\u00e9niya for the kind assistance he has given and in allowing me to have access to the Herbarium records and types; to the late Dr. Trimen, for immense assistance in identification of species and to a free use of his book; to Mr. A. F. Broun, late Conservator of Forests, for material help, encouragement, and valuable information; to Mr. Alfred Clark, the Acting Conservator of Forests, for use of his office collections of wood specimens; and to Messrs. C. Drieberg and H. O. Fox, for additional material ungrudgingly afforded.\n\nDILLENIACE\u00c6.\n\nThis Order consists of shrubs, climbers, and trees, and is represented in Ceylon by six Genera, viz., Delima, Tetracera, Acotrema, Schumacheria, Wormia, and Dillenia.\n\n1.\u2014Delima sarmentosa.\n\nKorasa-vel, S. \u0d85\u0db8\u0dca\u0db4\u0dcf\u0da7\u0dd2.\n\nTrim.

The stems contain large quantities of\nwater, and if cut in short lengths and suspended in a vertical position for a few moments the water will pour out in a distinct stream.\n\nThe leaves are used for polishing tortoise-shell, being not unlike sandpaper.\n\n[Rather common in the low-country of the moist region.]\n\n2.\u2014Schumacheria castan\u00e6folia.\n\nKekiri-war\u00e1, S. \u0d9a\u0dd9\u0d9a\u0dd2\u0dbb\u0dd3\u0db8.\n\nA large shrub, often 18 to 20 feet long, with straight stem, and large, ovate, prominently-veined leaves.\n\nVery abundant in all the wet forests of both Provinces up to about 1,500 feet.\n\nExceedingly common in Bambarabotuwa and Gilimale and around Ratnapura.\n\nThe wood is suitable for warichchies or very temporary purposes, as it is not durable and is easily broken.\n\nCommonly used for fencing by villagers in Sabaragamuwa.\n\n[Galle, Nilowwa, Southern Province.]\n\n3.\u2014Wormia triquetra.\n\nDiya-para, S. \u0daf\u0dd2\u0dba\u0db4\u0dbb.\n\nTrim. Cey. Flor., vol. I., p. 11, plate III.\n\nA smallish tree, with grayish bark, and large, smooth, glossy, green leaves. Easily recognized by the leaf-bud being enclosed in an envelope (stipule), that is, attached to the upper surface of the leaf stalk, from which it forces itself as it expands. The flowers are large, white, papery, with yellow stamens.\n\nVery abundant in all the wet forests of both Provinces up to about 2,500 feet, and frequently found in swampy land.\n\nThe wood is soft, easily split, of a brownish-red colour, with conspicuous \"silver grain,\" much like the European Oak. It is well suited for ceiling boards, dadoes, and panels,\ntaking a fine polish, and becoming very handsome when varnished. Light; weight, about 44 lb. per cubic foot.\n\n[Moist low region, ascending to its upper limit.]\n\n4.\u2014Dillenia indica.\n\nHo\u0144da-para, Wam-para, S. \u0db8\u0dcf\u0daf\u0dd4\u0dbb, \u0db8\u0dcf\u0daf\u0dd4\u0dbb.\nTrim. Cey. Flor., vol. I., p. 12.\n\nA small tree, generally with rather crooked stem, of a light reddish-brown colour of bark. The leaves are large, 15 inches, oblong-lanceolate, with strong, numerous, parallel, lateral veins. Flowers large and very handsome, often eight inches in diameter.\n\nThe wood is hard, close-grained, and has been used for sleepers, but owing to the irregular shape of the stem is not in much demand. Weight, 45 lb. per cubic foot.\n\nThe large fruits, with their conspicuous envelope of thickened sepals, are much used as a substitute for soap and as a hair wash.\n\nProbably introduced, but nowhere particularly common.\n[Low-country up to 2,000 feet; common.]\n\n5.\u2014Dillenia retusa.\n\nGoda-para, S. \u0db8\u0dcf\u0daf\u0dd4\u0dbb.\nTrim. Cey. Flor., vol. I., p. 13.\n\nA small tree, with grayish-brown bark and abundant dark-green leaves.\n\nThe fruits much resemble the last, but are only about two inches in diameter, and usually of an orange colour.\n\nA common tree up to 1,500 feet, except in the dry zone. Occurs plentifully in the H\u00e9w\u00e1gam K\u00f3ral\u00e9 and the greater part of the Kalutara District.\n\nThe wood is close-grained, fairly hard, reddish-brown, and in much favour for house-building, especially for rafters and wall-plates. Weight, 45 lb.\n\nIt is a durable wood, and with careful seasoning before use is much improved.\n\n[Moist low-country; rather common.]\nMAGNOLIACEAE.\n\nThe Order contains two Genera, Michelia and Kadsura.\n\n6.\u2014Michelia nilagirica.\n\nWal-sapu, S. \u0d85\u0dbd\u0dca\u0dbd\u0dcf.\n\nTrim. Cey. Flor., vol. I., p. 14.\n\nA moderately large tree, with smooth grayish bark, found only at high altitudes. It occurs above Gallagama and towards the Horton Plains in the Province of Sabaragamuwa, but not abundantly.\n\nLeaves on slender stalks about $3\\frac{1}{2}$ inches long, narrowing to both ends.\n\nA very valuable timber, greenish-brown when freshly cut. Is useful for doors and windows, and makes very handsome panels. Durable. Weight, about 40 lb. per cubic foot.\n\nFlowers very sweet-scented, pale yellow.\n\nKnown to up-country carpenters as Wal-buruta or Wild Satinwood, probably because of the likeness of the wood to the real Satinwood (Buruta).\n\n[Mountain zone forests above 5,000 feet; common.]\n\n7.\u2014M. Champaca.\n\nSapu or Hapu, S. \u0dc3\u0db4\u0dd4 or \u0dc3\u0db4\u0dd4.\n\nA large tree, much cultivated in Ceylon, but is an introduction. Much like the last, but the leaves are considerably larger.\n\nThe flowers\u2014for the sake of which probably the tree was first cultivated\u2014have a delicious scent, large, yellow. Seeds very freely, and attractive in colour, being not unlike pink coral.\n\nFairly common about old gardens between 2,000 and 3,000 feet, but nowhere regularly cultivated by the natives.\n\nAffords a most excellent timber, well suited for doors, windows, floors, and all sorts of panel work. Light straw-yellow, and takes a good varnish. Very durable, and when well seasoned will not warp readily. Weight, 40 lb. per cubic foot (?).\nANONACE\u00c6.\n\nThe Order contains thirteen Genera and includes the well-known Avocado Pear, Sour-sop, and Bullock\u2019s-heart. They are Uvaria, Cyathocalyx, Artabotrys, Unona, Polyalthia, Anaxagorea, Xylopia, Goniothalamus, Mitrephora, Bocagea, Miliusa, Orophea, and Alphonsea.\n\n8.\u2014Cyathocalyx zeylanicus.\n\n\u00cdpetta, S. &c. &c.\n\nTrim. Cey. Flor., vol. I., p. 20.\n\nA very tall clear-stemmed tree, branching closely at the top, with smooth grayish-brown bark.\n\nFairly abundant in all wet forests up to 1,000 feet. Plentiful in Gilimale and forests round the foot of Adam\u2019s Peak, and in the Pasdun K\u00f3ral\u00e9.\n\nAffords a wood of little value, except for temporary purposes. The sticks used by Kandyan chiefs for ceremonial purposes used to be of this wood. Weight, about 32 lb.\n\nFlowers green. Fruit large, about the size of a goose egg, and of similar shape.\n\n[Kandy, Hantane, Deltota, Galle.]\n\n9.\u2014Cananga odorata.\n\nHapu or Wana-hapu, S. &c. or &c. &c.\n\nTrim. Cey. Flor., vol. I., p. 22.\n\nA large tree with straight pale stem and drooping branches, found in some abundance in the valley of the Mah\u00e1-oya from Ambepussa towards Ka\u1e0dugann\u00e1wa.\n\nIt affords a light and easily-worked timber, which is in great favour with tea box contractors, as it meets most of the essentials requisite in a good tea box. The wood is light, and will take a fine polish, but is not durable. Weight, about 34 lb.\n\nThe well-known scent \u201cIlang-ilang\u201d is obtained from the large yellow flowers of this species.\n10.\u2014*Polyalthia longifolia.*\n\nMara-ilupai, T. \u0db8\u0dbb \u0d85\u0dbd\u0dd4\u0db4\u0dcf.\n\nTrim. Cey. Flor., vol. I., p. 24.\n\nA large erect tree with thick smooth bark.\n\nLeaves alternate, long, about nine inches, oblong, finely tapering to acute apex, rather undulate, thin, smooth, glossy above.\n\nFlowers greenish-yellow, in small groups on old wood.\n\nFound only in the dry zone in a wild state, but sometimes cultivated. Common on the banks of the Walawe river below Kaltota.\n\nWood soft, pale white, not durable. Weight, about 36 lb. per cubic foot. Suitable only for temporary work, tea boxes, &c.\n\n[Dry country in forests; common.]\n\n11.\u2014*XYLOPIA PARVIFLORA.*\n\nAtu-ketiya, Netew, S. \u0d85\u0da7\u0dd4\u0d9a\u0dd9\u0da7\u0dd2\u0dba, \u0db1\u0da7\u0dda\u0dc0.\n\nTrim. Cey. Flor., vol. I., p. 28.\n\nA tall straight tree with smooth bark, often growing to 50 feet, and then branching into an umbrella-like head.\n\nFairly common in the Kalutara District, and up the valley of the Kalu-ganga, but is not generally distributed.\n\nThe wood is suitable for mine props, as it is easily placed without much dressing, owing to its straightness. Not particularly durable.\n\nIt can easily be distinguished from the next species by the colour of the flower, which in this is ochreous-yellow, while in X. Championii the flowers are yellow with a purplish-red tinge at the base.\n\n[Moist low-country; rather common.]\n\n12.\u2014*XYLOPIA CHAMPIONII.*\n\nDat-ketiya, S. \u0daf\u0da7\u0dca\u0d9a\u0dd9\u0da7\u0dd2\u0dba.\n\nTrim. Cey. Flor., vol. I., p. 28.\n\nA moderately tall tree with dark brownish bark and small oval or lanceolate leaves. Fairly common, especially in\nall the wet forests at the foot of Adam's Peak, and extending to Balangoda. Flowers are solitary and sweet scented, axillary.\n\nAffords, when not too large, good wood for rafters and wall-plates, but will not stand exposure to sun and rain.\n\n[Ambegamuwa, Morawak K\u00f3ral\u00e9.]\n\n13.\u2014Mitrephora Heyneana.\n\nTrim. Cey. Flor., vol. I., p. 32.\n\nA small shapely tree with slender branches and twigs. Found only in the dry zone at the foot of the Rakw\u00e1na hills, to the east of Ballawinna. Rare.\n\nEasily distinguished by the very sweet dull yellow flowers, the inner parts of which are blotched with red, not unlike an orchid.\n\nThe straight round-stemmed poles afford good wood for rafters, but attain no great size.\n\n[Haragama, Dambulla, Kal\u00e1vewa, Horowwapot\u00e1na.]\n\n14.\u2014Bocagea Coriacea.\n\nKeku, S. \u0db8\u0dd2\u0da7\u0dca\u0da7.\n\nTrim. Cey. Flor., vol. I., p. 34.\n\nA fairly large tree, with dark bark, and dark glossy green leaves on very short stalks. Moderately common in the hill-country up to 5,000 feet.\n\nThe bark is easily stripped from the tree, and is used for tying. The wood is pale yellowish-white. Suitable for rafters, but not durable.\n\n[Raxawa, Dimbula.]\n\nMENISPERMAC\u00c6.\n\nThis Order, which in Ceylon is represented only by climbers, consists of ten Genera: Tinospora, Anamirta, Coscinium, Tiliacora, Limacia, Cocculus, Pachygone, Stephania, Cissampelos, and Cyclea. They are mostly medicinal.\n15.\u2014Coscinium fenestratum.\n\nWeni-vel, S. \u0d85\u0d9a\u0dca\u0d9a\u0dd2\u0dba\u0dda.\nTrim. Cey. Flor., vol. I., p. 41.\n\nA large woody climber, with soft grayish bark and large stiff peltate leaves, dark green above and grayish below, the under surface being coated with fine hairs, forming a felt-like substance.\n\nThe stems, when cut, are a rich chrome-yellow, and afford one of the dyes used for staining Buddhist priests' robes. A strong rope is made from the stem, used for buffalo tethers.\n\nIt affords a valuable bitter tonic.\n\nCommon in the intermediate zone, such as Rambukkana and many parts of K\u00e9galla.\n\n[Moist low-country up to 2,000 feet.]\n\nCAPPARIDE\u00c6.\n\nThe Order contains mostly shrubs, and often climbing plants, besides small trees. It is represented by six Genera, viz., Cleome, Gynandropsis, M\u00e6rua, Crataeva, Cadaba, and Capparis.\n\n16.\u2014Crataeva Roxburghii.\n\nLunu-warana, S. \u0d85\u0d9a\u0dca\u0d9a\u0dd2\u0dba; N\u00e1vilanka\u00ed, T. \u0db8\u0dcf\u0dbd\u0dd4\u0db8\u0dca\u0db4\u0dd4, Trim. Cey. Flor., vol. I., p. 59.\n\nA small tree, with pale grayish bark and deciduous leaves. Occurs only in the dry zone towards Liyangahaella, where it was probably introduced, as it is to be found more commonly towards Wirawilla and Tisamahar\u00e1ma, in the Southern Province.\n\nWood pale, moderately hard, but little used by the Sinhalese. Weight, about 36 lb. Easily distinguished by its handsome greenish-white flowers that appear with the new foliage.\n\n[Jaffna, Trincomalee, Hambantota, Dambulla.]\nBIXACE\u00c6.\n\nThe Order contains six Genera, viz., Scolopia, Erythrospermum, Flacourtia, Aberia, Trichadenia, and Hydnocarpus.\n\n17.\u2014Scolopia acuminata.\n\nKa\u1e6du-k\u0113nda, S. \u0d9a\u0dd0\u0da7\u0dd4\u0d9a\u0dda\u0db1\u0dca\u0daf.\nTrim. Cey. Flor., vol. I., p. 70.\n\nA moderate-sized tree, with many simple spines on the young stems and branches. Fairly common, but chiefly in the drier parts of both Provinces, at low altitudes and in rocky places.\n\nAffords useful wood for posts and rafters, and when it is not exposed it is durable.\n\nLeaves about four inches, oval, tapering, finely pointed, dentate round the margin, attached by very short stalks.\n\n[Hantane, Nilambe, Deltota, Alut-oya.]\n\n18.\u2014SCOLOPIA G\u00c4RTNERI.\n\nKa\u1e6du-kuru\u1e47\u1e0du, S. \u0d9a\u0dd0\u0da7\u0dd4\u0d9a\u0dbb\u0dd4\u0dab\u0dca\u0da9\u0dd4.\nTrim. Cey. Flor., vol. I., p. 71.\n\nA moderately large tree, with compound spines on the stem, giving the tree a formidable appearance.\n\nFound in moderate abundance in lower parts of both Provinces, but is nowhere common. Occurs in the Mah\u0101oya valley and in parts of the Hapitigam Koral\u00e9, and also near the base of the Rakw\u00e1na and Balangoda hills.\n\nAffords a very good wood for wall-plates and posts, but never gets to a size large enough for making big beams.\n\n[Both moist and dry regions.]\n\n19.\u2014TRICHADENIA ZBYLANICA.\n\nTolol, Titta-\u0113ta, S. \u0dad\u0ddc\u0dbd\u0ddd\u0dbd, \u0dc3\u0da7\u0dca\u0da7\u0dd2\u0da7\u0dd3\u0da7.\nTrim. Cey. Flor., vol. I., p. 74, pl. VIII.\n\nA large straight-stemmed tree, with big leaves prominently veined below. Moderately common in many parts of the Province of Sabaragamuwa. Occurs in the valley of the Hangomuw\u00e1-ganga, Gilimale, Rakw\u00e1na, and Balango\u1e0da.\nThe wood is often used for planking for plumbago mines, and sometimes for tea boxes, but is not durable.\n\nAn oil used in skin diseases is extracted by the natives from the seeds, which are very bitter, hence the name Titta-eta.\n\nThe leaves of young plants of this species are palmate or deeply lobed.\n\n[Alagalla, Hunasgiriya, Kottawa.]\n\n20.\u2014HYDNOCARPUS VENENATA.\n\nMaku\u1e37u, S. \u0db8\u0d9a\u0dd4\u0dbd\u0dd4; M\u00e1kal, T. \u0db8\u0d9a\u0dcf\u0dbd\u0dca.\n\nTrim. Cey. Flor., vol. I., p. 75.\n\nA very common water-loving plant, easily distinguished by its pale and very fluted stem and long lanceolate leaves.\n\nIt occurs in both wet and dry zones, and generally by the sides of rivers and streams up to 2,500 feet.\n\nThe wood is close, hard, and dense, but owing to the deep flutings of the stem is not much used. Weight, 48 lb. per cubic foot.\n\nThe seeds are highly poisonous, and are made use of to poison, or rather to intoxicate, fish, so that they may be easily caught. An oil extracted from the seed is said to be of use in leprosy and skin diseases.\n\nDuring the season when \"Maku\u1e37u\" fruits are abundant there is considerable danger attending the consumption of fish or prawns that have fed on the decayed seeds, as the poison appears to be communicated to the flesh of the fish that has swallowed it. In pools of water in the dry zone, where quantities of these fruits have accumulated, all the fish appear to have been killed, probably from this cause, thus explaining the fact that such pools rarely poison any large fish.\n\n[Kurun\u0113gala, P\u00e9r\u0101deniya, Eastern Province.]\n\n[The well-known Annatto (Bixa Orellana) is an introduced member of this Order, as is also the magnificent Ela-imbul (Cochlospermum Gossypium), found near temples in the dry zone, where it is used for flower offerings.]\nPOLYGALACE\u00c6.\n\nThe Order is mostly represented by herbs in Ceylon, and consists of three Genera: Polygala, Salomonia, and Xanthophyllum.\n\n21.\u2014*Xanthophyllum flavescens.*\n\nKeley-gas, S. \u0d85\u0dbd\u0dca\u0db4\u0dda \u0dc0\u0dbb\u0dca\u0d9c.\nTrim. Cey. Flor., vol.

It includes the well known Mangosteen, which however is only an introduced plant. The Order is represented by four Genera, viz., Garcinia, Calophyllum, Kayea, and Mesua.\n\n22.\u2014*Garcinia Cambogia.*\n\nGoraka, S. \u0d9c\u0ddd\u0dbb\u0d9a; Korokka-puli, T. \u0d9a\u0ddd\u0dbb\u0ddc\u0d9a\u0dca\u0d9a\u0db4\u0dd4\u0dbd\u0dd2.\nTrim. Cey. Flor., vol. I., p. 95.\nA medium-sized tree, with large head and dark-brown bark, easily distinguished by its large and deeply-grooved fruits, that are about the size of an orange.\nThe Goroka is very common in all the moist forests of both Provinces, and is especially plentiful in the Kalutara District.\nThe wood is pale ashy-brown and very variable in its hardness, and is in great favour as a timber for plumbago mine supports. Weight, 50 lb.\nThe fruits are eaten, but are much too acid to find favour with Europeans.\nSilver, boiled in an infusion of Goraka fruit, becomes perfectly bright and clear, and for this reason silversmiths often make use of it.\n\nThe resinous gum obtained from this plant might be made use of as a pigment, but in its crude state appears to attract insufficient attention.\n\n[Low-country up to 1,500 feet.]\n\n23.\u2014*Garcinia Morella.*\n\nKana-goraka, Goka\u1e6du, S. \u0db8\u0dcf\u0dbb\u0dca\u0d9c\u0ddd\u0d9a\u0dcf, \u0db8\u0dcf\u0dbb\u0dca\u0d9c\u0ddd\u0d9a\u0dcf.\n\nTrim. Cey. Flor., vol. I., p. 96.\n\nA small tree, with smooth brown bark, easily distinguished from the last by its small fruits.\n\nGenerally distributed, but not so common as the last.\n\nThe wood is hard and close. It is used only for temporary purposes, as posts, &c. Gamboge is obtained from this species in some quantity, though the tree is not made special use of for its extraction. Weight, 56 lb. per cubic foot.\n\n[Delto\u1e6da, Hantane, \u00dava.]\n\n24.\u2014*Garcinia Echinocarpa.*\n\nMa\u1e0dol, S. \u0db8\u0da9\u0ddc\u0dbd\u0dca.\n\nTrim. Cey. Flor., vol. I., p. 96.\n\nA large tree, with dark bark and many aerial roots near the base of the stem.\n\nIt can easily be recognized by its fruit, which is covered with sharp prickles (tubercles).\n\nModerately common at high elevations and down to about 2,000 feet; frequently gregarious. Occurs plentifully in the Peak range, and among the Panilla hills in the Atakalan K\u00f3ral\u00e9, Sabaragamuwa.\n\nWood rather light, easily split. It is useful as a shingle wood, and if tarred becomes fairly durable. Weight, 50 lb.\n\nThe seeds yield an oil that in many remote villages is used largely as a luminant by the poorer classes.\n\n[Hunasgiria, Ma\u1e0dulkel\u00e9, R\u0101ngala, where it is the principal tree of the hill forests.]\n25.\u2014Garcinia terpnophylla.\n\nKoka\u1e6diya, S. \u0d9a\u0ddc\u0d9a\u0da7\u0dd2\u0dba.\nTrim. Cey. Flor., vol. I., p. 97.\nA moderately large tree with slender drooping branches, smooth thin yellowish-brown bark.\n\nLeaves opposite, rather diverse in size and outline, often eight inches long, usually smaller, lanceolate, oval, tapering to base, with distinct lateral veins, on short stalks.\n\nYoung leaves often pink. Flowers yellow, scented.\n\nWidely distributed, but nowhere very common. It occurs in the Pasdun K\u00f3ral\u00e9, Sinha R\u00e1ja, Adam\u2019s Peak forests, Balangoda (especially near to Pettigalla estate), and parts of Rakw\u00e1na.\n\nThis is probably the hardest wood in Ceylon, and owing to the difficulty of cutting it is not a favourite with carpenters.\n\nIt is very durable, either in air or in water, and well adapted to beams required for large loads. The wood is very handsome, being a yellowish-brown, and takes a perfect polish. When used for piles the wood becomes browner in colour, and seems to harden. Axes are easily broken in felling Koka\u1e6diya.

Owing to the rarity of the tree the wood is little known. Suitable for flooring boards.\n\nWeight, 39 to 40 lb. per cubic foot.\n\n27.\u2014Calophyllum Burmanni.\n\nGuru-k\u00edna, S. \u0d9c\u0dd4\u0dbb\u0dd4\u0d9a\u0dd2\u0db1\u0dcf; Chirupunnai, T. \u0d9a\u0dd2\u0dbb\u0dd4\u0db4\u0dd4\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1\u0dcf.\nTrim. Cey. Flor., vol. I., p. 99.\nA small rather bushy tree with thick yellowish-brown furrowed bark.\n\nLeaves opposite, small, about two inches, broadly ovate, tapering slightly to short stalks. Lateral veins very fine, close, and prominent on both sides.\n\nFlowers white, in axillary spreading panicles.\n\nWood reddish-brown suffused with a pinkish tinge, hard, close, heavy.

Cey. Flor., vol. I., p. 100.\n\nA smallish tree, with grayish bark, and large, smooth, glossy green leaves, the under surfaces of which exhibit very fine close lateral veining; about seven inches, ovate, oblong.\n\nModerately abundant from the sea coast to the foot of the higher ranges, and is often planted; probably introduced.\n\nAffords an excellent wood, tough and rather elastic. In much favour for cart poles, but as it is beautifully grained it might, if dressed, be largely used for ornamental work. Weight, 45 lb. per cubic foot.\n\nThe seeds yield an abundant oil, easily extracted.\n\nExperiments conducted by myself show that 3,000 fruits can be obtained from a single tree of fifteen years of age, and that this yield appears to increase thereafter.\n\n[Low-country, principally on the sea coast.]\n\n29.\u2014*Calophyllum tomentosum.*\n\nK\u00edna, S. \u0d9a\u0dd2\u0db1\u0dcf.\n\nTrim. Cey. Flor., vol. I., p. 101.\n\nA large tree, with densely tomentose leaf buds, and rather long opposite lanceolate leaves.\nFairly common at from 1,500 feet to 3,000 feet elevation. Occurs in Balangoda, Rakwana, Bambarabotuwa, and parts of the Sinha Raja forest.\n\nThe wood is well known to carpenters, and is a favourite for building purposes. Well suited for doors, door frames, floors, ceilings, rafters, or posts. Takes an excellent colour on being varnished, and if suitably dressed should be a favourite veneer wood. Tough, durable, easily worked. Weight, 36 to 38 lb. per cubic foot.\n\nThe seeds yield an oil\u2014Kina-tel\u2014that is in much favour with the Sinhalese as a specific in skin diseases, and especially for itch.\n\n[Moist low-country, at elevations of 2,000 to 4,000 feet.]\n\n30.\u2014CALOPHYLLUM BRACTEATUM.\n\nWalu-kina, S. \u0db8\u0dd4\u0dbd\u0dca\u0dbd.\n\nTrim. Cey. Flor., vol. I., p. 102.\n\nA very handsome tree, with drooping willow-like branches, usually terminating in long pale silvery-white leaves. Easily distinguished by the intermediate scale-like leaves at the ends of the branches.\n\nNot uncommon in the wet forests of both Provinces. Occurs rather plentifully near Ratnapura, but does not ascend to high altitudes.\n\nThe wood is very handsome, being a pale soft white, closely grained, with reddish-brown graining. Well suited for ceiling boards and dadoes, or window frames. Light, 32 lb. per cubic foot.\n\nLike most of our Calophylla this wood has been overlooked as one suitable for European use, as it is easily worked up and admits of a fine polish.\n\n31.\u2014CALOPHYLLUM WALKERII.\n\nKina, S. \u0d9a\u0dd2\u0db1\u0dcf.\n\nTrim. Cey. Flor., vol. I., p. 104.\n\nA large tree with dark reddish-brown rough bark and small roundish crowded leaves.\nA common hill species, abundant about the Horton Plains, where it often becomes a very large tree.\n\nThe timber is a favourite with up-country carpenters, and deservedly so, as it is applicable for all sorts of building purposes. Light reddish-brown with beautiful wavy brown grain, easily worked, durable. Weight, 46 lb. per cubic foot. Sometimes used for shingles, but does not split clean.\n\nThe flowers are pinkish-white and sweet smelling.\n\n[Ambagamuwa, Knuckles, upper montane zone forests.]\n\n32.\u2014KAYEA STYLOSA.\n\nSuwa\u0144da, S. \u0db8\u0dd9\u0da7\u0dca\u0da7.\n\nTrim.

Leaves small, lanceolate, stiff.\n\nVery rare. Occurs in the Pasdun K\u00f3ral\u00e9 on branches of the Maguru-ga\u1e45ga.\n\nWood moderately hard, fine grained, of a handsome brownish-red colour. Well suited for window frames or sash bars and panels.\n\n33.\u2014Mesua ferrea (IRONWOOD).\n\nN\u00e1, S. \u0db8\u0dda; N\u00e1kka, T. \u0db8\u0dda\u0da7\u0dca\u0da7.\n\nTrim. Cey. Flor., vol. I., p. 105.\n\nA large handsome tree with fine bold head when old, rather smooth bark. Leaves numerous, about three to four inches long, dark shining green above, ashy below, and coated with a white waxy dust. When in young leaf there is no more beautiful tree in our forests than this.\n\nFairly common and of wide distribution, probably due to the fact that it is a favourite tree for flower offerings at Buddhist shrines and for groves near old viharas. The flowers are sweet scented and very beautiful, easily recognized by their large white petals. Occurs in a wild state up to 4,000 feet, especially in sandy soils. Abundant at Galagama and near the dividing range between the Central\nProvince and the Province of Sabaragamuwa, Pannila, Rakw\u00e1na, Gilimale, Eratne, parts of the Pasdun K\u00f3ral\u00e9, and Sinha R\u00e1ja forests, and again near Kitulgalla and the valley of the Ritigaha-oya.\n\nAffords one of our hardest and perhaps most durable woods. The timber is of great value for all heavy work, such as beams for bridges, trusses, bridge planks, and the like. Rather easily split owing to its straight grain, and hence its value for shingles. Weight, $77\\frac{1}{2}$ lb.\n\nIn colour the wood is a dull red when well seasoned, paler when fresh.\n\nThe seeds yield an oil that is said to be of use in skin diseases.\n\n34.\u2014Mesua Thwaitesii.\n\nDiya-n\u00e1, S. \u0daf\u0dd2\u0dba\u0db1\u0dcf.\nTrim.

Occurs near Maskeliya, Bogawantal\u00e1wa, and the Horton Plains.\n\nThe wood is much like the last, and is a favourite for weather boarding. Fairly durable.\n\n[Gregarious in forests above Ramboda.]\n\nDIPTEROCARPACE\u00c6.\n\nThis is perhaps the most valuable Order we have in Ceylon for timber-yielding trees, and affords the tallest individual examples.\n\nAll examples of the Order are more or less resinous, and many yield valuable by-products in the form of \"dammar\" and varnish resin.\n\nIn view of its singular importance as a Family it may be desirable in time to re-write the whole Order, after prolonged examination of the structure of the individual species now grouped under the ten Genera into which the Dipterocarps of Ceylon are divided, as at present much uncertainty exists respecting the proper classification of individuals. The enormous size of the trees, irregularity of flowering,\npeculiarity of germination, and diversity of structure, all combine to render the Order very fascinating to the scientific and non-scientific botanist alike.\n\nFor the present I adopt Dr. Trimen's sub-divisions of the Family till more perfect materialis obtained for a rearrangement of Genera and of species. The Ceylon Genera consist of Dipterocarpus, with 5 species; Shorea, with 5, probably 8, species; Doona, with 11 species; Hopea, with 3, and possibly 4, species; Sunaptea, with 2; Vatica, with 3; Balanocarpus, with 1; Vateria, with 1; Stemonoporus, with 13, and more probably 16; and Monoporandra, with 2; making a total of 53, of which the majority are useful trees.\n\n40.\u2014DIPTEROCARPUS HISPIDUS.\n\nB\u00fa-hora, S. \u0db8\u0dd4\u0dc4\u0dd4\u0dbb.\n\nTrim. Cey. Flor., vol. I., p. 114.\n\nAn enormous tree, with straight cylindrical pale grayish stem, often attaining 100 feet to the first branch. Easily recognized by the dense stiff masses of rigid hair on the leaf-stalks and stipules.\n\nFairly common in the wet forests, but not generally distributed. Abundant in the Kukulu K\u00f3ral\u00e9, Sinha R\u00e1ja forest, parts of Gilimale, Eratne, and near Karawita; occasionally in lower part of the Pasdun K\u00f3ral\u00e9.\n\nThe wood is pale reddish-brown, very resinous, and of great value in barge-building, cask-making, and for mine-planking. Lasts well under water. Weight, about 46 lb. per cubic foot.\n\n41.\u2014DIPTEROCARPUS ZEYLANICUS.\n\nHora, S. \u0dc3\u0ddd\u0dbb.\n\nTrim. Cey. Flor., vol. I., p. 114, plate X.\n\nA tall clear-stemmed tree, often attaining enormous proportions. I have measured individual trees 22 feet in girth with 90 feet of clear stem.\n\nThis is perhaps one of the best-known timber trees in Ceylon on its western side, and has a wide distribution within the wet zone.\nIt is partially gregarious, and in places curiously restricted to certain spots, but, generally speaking, is common.\n\nThe wood is in very great demand for boat-building, cask manufacture, and beams for temporary structures. Exposed, it is not durable, and quickly gives way to dry-rot. Opinions vary considerably as to its lasting power, some asserting that Hora will last for years as a building timber, but I differ from this view. Weight, 52 lb. per cubic foot. Pale brownish-red. Affords a quantity of gummy resin.\n\n[Moist low-country and extending into lower montane zone.]\n\n42.\u2014DIPTEROCARPUS SCABRIDUS.\n\nHora, S. \u0db8\u0dd4\u0dbd\u0dca.\n\nTrim. Cey. Flor., vol. I., p. 115.\n\nA large, tall, straight tree with pale bark, not easily distinguished from the last except by the fruit, which has shorter wings and much-webbed lobes on the seed capsule.\n\nWood pale, moderately soft.\n\nVery uncommon. Occurs at Midellena in the Pasdun K\u00f3ral\u00e9.\n\n43.\u2014DIPTEROCARPUS GLANDULOSUS.\n\nDorona, S. \u0db8\u0dd4\u0dbd\u0dca.\n\nA lofty tree much like Hora, but has smaller leaves with generally about eleven pairs of lateral veins. The fruit wings are much shorter than in Hora.\n\nFairly common, but irregularly distributed. Occurs in the Kuruwiti K\u00f3ral\u00e9, Rakw\u00e1na, part of Balangoda, and Bambarabotuwa, Kitulgalla, and in the Siyan\u0119 K\u00f3ral\u00e9.\n\nThe villagers value this tree for the sake of its wood oil, which they obtain by burning charcoal in cavities cut in the stem. The oil so obtained is mixed with the latex of certain creepers, and is placed in winnow-shaped scoops that are attached to long slender poles, and gently swept over the tops of young growing paddy for the purpose of catching the \"fly,\" that is readily caught by this sticky gumming process.\nThe oil is also of medicinal value.\n\nThe timber is moderately hard, and suitable for mine planking. Weight, about 45 lb.\n\n[Moist low-country; rare.]\n\n44.\u2014SHOREA OBLONGIFOLIA.\n\nDummala, S. g@\u00aec.\nTrim. Cey. Flor., vol. I., p. 116.\n\nA large stately tree with brownish bark often flaking off in large pieces.\n\nThe leaves are generally about six to eight inches in length, very oblong in outline, shining above.\n\nIt is rather widely distributed in the wet forests of both Provinces up to about 2,000 feet. Occurs near Avisawella, Labugama, Ratnapura, Rakw\u00e1na, Gilimale, and Rasagalla near Balangoda.\n\nAffords a strong useful timber for house-building, particularly for joists and flooring planks, or mine-planking.\n\nYields a clear resin, suitable for pale varnishes.\n\nWeight, about 60 lb. per cubic foot. Wood brownish, with a wavy grain.\n\n45.\u2014SHOREA LISSOPHYLLA.\n\nSometimes called Yakahalu, S. \u0db8\u0dcf\u0dbb\u0dca\u0d9c.\nTrim. Cey. Flor., vol.

Occurs in parts of the Kalutara District, near Culloden estate, at Yagirella, and Lewanduwa. Also at Karawita in Sabaragamuwa. Generally affects rocky places.\n\nWood resinous, hard, pale brown, suitable for flooring planks.\n\n[Southern Province, Nillowa, Akuressa.]\n\n46.\u2014SHOREA STIPULARIS.\n\nLocally called Yakahalu, S. \u0db8\u0dcf\u0dbb\u0dca\u0d9c.\nTrim. Cey. Flor., vol. I., p. 118.\nA large tree, readily distinguished by the prominent stipules that remain present for the last five or six leaves on each young branch. The fruits are large, with strongly-marked curved wings.\n\nNot very abundant. Occurs in the Kukulu Koral\u00e9, Sinha Raja, Rakwana, and parts of Bambarabotuwa.\n\nTimber little known; probably suitable for rafters.\n\n[Morawak Koral\u00e9.]\n\n47.\u2014DOONA ZEYLANICA.\n\nDun, S. g\u0331t\u0331.\n\nTrim. Cey. Flor., vol. I., p. 119.\n\nA very large tree with dark brown rough bark and small drooping leaves. Generally gregarious, and forming quite a characteristic tree in our hill forests.\n\nFairly abundant above 1,500 up to 4,500 feet, but abruptly terminating in its distribution on reaching the Uva boundary or the limits of the dry zone.\n\nOn the south-east of Sabaragamuwa I have not obtained it beyond Kumburugamuwa village in the Kolonna Koral\u00e9. Scarce in the Western Province.\n\nIt affords an excellent timber for building purposes, beams, joists, and sleepers, and cannot be surpassed for shingles, which are easily split from it.\n\nIt attains an immense size, but has the objection of having the heartwood soft. The wood is brownish straw colour with fine close grain. Weight, 68 to 70 lb., according to seasoning.\n\n[Lower montane zone and upper zone of moist low-country.]\n\n48.\u2014DOONA GARDNERI (RED DOON).\n\nDun, Yakahalu, S. c\u0331t\u0331, \u1e6d\u0331a\u1e6d\u0331a\u1e6d\u0331.\n\nTrim.

In the Western Province it occurs near Avisawella, Badureliya, Hewissa, and Labugama. In Sabaragamuwa it is plentiful in nearly all the wet forests, but is rarely found above 2,500 feet.\n\nThis species affords a most excellent wood for tea boxes, being light, easily worked, and handsome. It is quite unsuitable for any permanent work, but is sometimes passed off by dishonest contractors for Doona zeylanica.\n\nWeight, about 36 lb. per cubic foot.\n\n[Hiniduma, Southern Province.]\n\n52.\u2014DOONA OVALIFOLIA.\n\nPini-beraliya, S. \u0db8\u0dd4\u0dbd\u0dca\u0dbd.\n\nTrim.

V., p. 383.\n\nAn immense tree with smooth pale grayish bark, small rather scattered leaves that are dark green above and pale ashy below, stiff, pointed at apex, on stalks of about half an inch.\n\nOnly found on the top of Hunuwal-kanda, north of Pelmadulla, where I discovered it in 1893.*\n\nThe timber is very hard, pale grayish-white, with close grain. Weight, 70 lb. Suitable for beams or trusses.\n\nMALVACEAE.\n\nThis Order is mostly represented by herbs and shrubs, of which our common Shoeflower may be taken as a characteristic type.\n\nMost of the species comprising it have fine fibrous bark suitable for rough tying, but with care and proper appliances it is possible that some\u2014notably Urena and Hibiscus\u2014might\n\n* Since these pages were sent to press, this rare plant has been rediscovered by myself on the summit of Eratne-kanda\u2014a precipitous mountain on the borders of the Peak wilderness.\nbe turned into account for rope, sacking, or binding-cloth. The Order contains twelve Genera in Ceylon: Sida, Abutilon, Wissadula, Urena, Pavonia, Julostylis, Dicellostyles, Hibiscus, Thespesia, Bombax, Eriodendron, and Cullenia.\n\n65.\u2014Hibiscus tiliaceus.\n\nBeli-pat\u1e6da, S. \u0db6\u0dd9\u0dbd\u0dd2\u0db4\u0da7\u0dca\u0da7.\nTrim.

Easily distinguished when in fruit by its very brilliant almost fiery orange fruit follicles.\nModerately common up to about 1,000 feet. Is found in Colombo as an ornamental tree. Occurs in various parts of the K\u00e9galla District.\n\nChiefly useful for the sake of its inner bark, which can be removed in broad thin sheets; used for string.\n\n[Low-country; common.]\n\n72.\u2014Heritiera littoralis.\n\nEtuna, S. \u0d85\u0dc1\u0dca\u200d\u0dbb\u0dcf (known in parts of the Pasdun K\u00f3ral\u00e9 by the incorrect name Ho-m\u00e9diriya); Chomuntiri, T. \u0d9c\u0dd9\u0dc3\u0dca\u0da7\u0dd4\u0dc0\u0dca\u0daf\u0dd2\u0dba.\n\nTrim. Cey. Flor., vol. I., p. 167.\n\nA rather large water-loving tree, with deeply furrowed bark. The flowers are very minute, followed by large boat-shaped seeds.\n\nOnly found close to the sea, on the banks of the Kalu-ganga, Bentota river, P\u00e1nadure river, and such-like situations.\n\nWood very hard, tough, close-grained, and durable. Weight, about 75 lb. per cubic foot.\n\nSuitable for beams, posts, piles, and heavy work, but not sufficiently common to be in much demand.\n\n[Trincomalee, Chilaw.]\n\n73.\u2014Pterospermum suberifolium.\n\nWelan, S. \u0d85\u0dc1\u0dca\u200d\u0dbb\u0dcf; Miya\u0144ku, T. \u0db8\u0dcf\u0dad\u0dca\u200d\u0dbb\u0dcf.\n\nTrim. Cey. Flor., vol. I., p. 169.\n\nA moderately large tree with thick bark. The leaves are most extremely variable in form, especially in young plants, when they assume all shapes, from lanceolate to digitate. The flowers are white and sweet-smelling.\n\nA fairly common tree up to 2,000 feet, but assumes its greatest size in the dry region.\n\nWood light, very tough, pale reddish-brown, about 36 lb. per cubic foot. Suitable for weather-boarding.\n\n[Low-country, especially in dry region.]\nTILIACE\u00c6.\n\nThe Order is represented in Ceylon by six Genera, viz., Pityranthe, Berrya, Grewia, Triumfetta, Corchorus, and Elaeocarpus. The greater number of species yield valuable fibre for coarse work, such as gunny bags and the like.\n\n74.\u2014Berrya Ammonilla (TRINCOMALEE WOOD).\n\nHal-milla, S. \u0db8\u0dcf\u0dbb\u0dca\u0d9c\u0dd2; Chavandalai, T. \u0dc3\u0dcf\u0db8\u0dcf\u0db1\u0dca. Trim. Cey. Flor., vol. I., p. 173.\n\nA tall slender-stemmed tree with pale smooth rather thin bark. Leaves large, somewhat ovate, on rather long green stalks. Flowers white, small, in large panicles.\n\nModerately abundant, and often found in gardens in many parts of both Provinces. In the natural state it is generally confined to the dry country. Occurs all through the wilder parts of the Kolonna, Atakalan, and Meda Koral\u00e9s, and in moderate abundance in the Kegalla District towards the North-Western Province boundary.\n\nA magnificent timber, and one of great value for many purposes. The wood is rather light,\u201456 to 60 lb. per cubic foot,\u2014pale yellowish, with very fine close transverse lines across the grain.\n\nIt is used in boat-building, for oil casks, gun carriages, and carriage shafts, owing to its toughness and durability. A tree that would well repay cultivation in dry districts.\n\n[Forests of the dry country.]\n\n75.\u2014Grewia tili\u00e6folia.\n\nDaminiya, S. \u0db8\u0dcf\u0dbb\u0dca\u0d9c\u0dd2; Chadaichi, T. \u0dc3\u0dcf\u0db8\u0dcf\u0db1\u0dca. Trim. Cey. Flor., vol. I., p. 175.\n\nUsually a smallish tree with pale grayish-red bark, easily stripped in young plants, when it is suitable for rope.\n\nThe heartwood is close, heavy, and durable, but rarely found of any great size.\nVery common in the dry country at the foot of the hills, particularly from the base of the Rakw\u00e1na hills towards Dapone, K\u00eblla, Embilipitiya, and the eastern portion of the M\u00ebda K\u00f3ral\u00e9.\n\n[Low-country and extending into lower montane zone; common.]\n\n76.\u2014*El\u00e6ocarpus serratus* (WILD OLIVE).\n\nWeralu, S. \u0d85\u0da9\u0dd4.\n\nTrim.

Found in a semi-wild state in the valley of the Mah\u00e1-oya, foot of the Dolosb\u00e1g\u00e9 hills, and along the Ritigaha-oya.\n\nWood is a cedar-like, soft, quick-growing, light timber, easily polished, and responds well to varnish.\n\nIn great favour for tea boxes, ceilings, and dadoes, but too light to stand straining loads or exposure. Often used for outriggers for boats, owing to its great lightness. Weight, 26 lb. per cubic foot.\n\nThe seeds are extremely hard and difficult of germination, unless aided by artificial means.\n\nA tree well worthy of extended cultivation, as it grows with such rapidity.\n\n95.\u2014Azadirachta indica (MARGOSA).\n\nKohomba, S. \u0d9a\u0ddc\u0dc4\u0ddd\u0db8\u0dca\u0db6; V\u00e9mpu, T. \u0dc0\u0dd9\u0db8\u0dd4. Trim. Cey. Flor., vol. I., p. 244.\n\nA large very handsome tree with spreading crown, rough brownish-red bark, and crowded leaves.\nUsually a dry-zone tree, and probably run wild from introduced plants, as it is a favourite medicinal plant with Sinhalese and Tamils alike.\n\nOccurs rather freely between Kaltota and Embilipitiya in Sabaragamuwa, and only, so far as I am aware, in gardens in the Western Province.\n\nThe wood is hard, heavy, a very handsome red-brown, with large graining.\n\nTakes a magnificent polish, rendering it valuable as a panel wood, or for cabinets and the like. Weight, about 50 lb.\n\nPerhaps best known for its evil-smelling oil, the Veppeni of the Tamils, used both as an insecticide and medicinally.\n\nThe leaves are very bitter and afford a tonic.\n\n[\u00dava, Hambanto\u1e6da.]\n\n96.\u2014Pseudocarpa Championii.\n\nG\u00f3napana, S. \u0d9c\u0ddd\u0db1\u0db4\u0dcf.\n\nTrim, Cey.

Cey. Flor., vol. I., p. 253.\n\nA rather small tree with very rough grayish-brown bark and fine drooping pinnate leaves, with abundant unequal-bladed small leaflets. Flowers small, creamy-white.\n\nA characteristic tree in the dry zone, extending all through the eastern and south-eastern parts of Sabaragamuwa, from the Walawe river to the foot of the Rakwana and Balangoda hills up to about 1,000 feet. Does not occur in a wild state, or very rarely in the Western Province.\n\nA most valuable wood. A striking example of its durability is to be found in the magnificent one-arch bridge at P\u00e9ra\u00e9niya. Unrivalled for its durability. Used for furniture, and in great favour for almirahs. Largely used in Europe for brush handles. It is a fine golden-yellow with a silk-like lustre. Sleepers made of this wood have been known to last for thirty years, indicating its value for that purpose, especially as it is white ant proof. Not very heavy: 56 lb. per cubic foot.\n\nThe so-called Flowered Satinwood is not a distinct species, and cannot be detected in the living tree, the condition known as \"flowered\" being probably due to arrested growth at a certain stage of the plant's life.\n\nAffords a gum of a jelly-like consistency when freshly formed.\n\nThe finest Satinwood comes from the West Indies, and is said to be from an unknown tree!\n\nCaptain Gillam, of the Central Timber Dep\u00f4t, affords the following particulars respecting the value of Satinwood sold in Colombo:\n\nFrom 1892 to 1897 inclusive, 53,079 c. ft. sold for Rs. 123,779.\nFrom 1898 to 1901 inclusive, 58,107 c. ft. sold for Rs. 124,930.\nOLACINE\u00c6.\n\nThe Order, which is composed of trees, shrubs, and sometimes creeping plants, is in Ceylon composed of ten Genera, viz., Ximenia, Olax, Strombosia, Opilia, Cansjera, Lasianthera, Gomphandra, Apodytes, Mappia, and Pyrena-cantha, few of which are of importance here.\n\n101.\u2014OLAX ZEYLANICA.\n\nM\u00eblla, S. \u1e62i\u1e0d\u1e0d\u0113.\nTrim.

Cey. Flor., vol. I., p. 270.\nA tall slender-stemmed pale gray rough-barked tree, easily distinguished by its bright orange-yellow inner bark on chipping off the outer nodules on the buttresses. Leaves rather uneven, sometimes faintly serrate on the margin. The seeds (samara) are long, papery, wing-like structures that afford a powerfully acrid oil in great favour as a preventive against leeches, which is often sold in considerable\nquantities to pilgrims visiting Adam's Peak. This oil is known as Pottu-\u0113ta tel.\n\nThe ground up bark is often used as an aid to beauty by Tamil women, in the same way as saffron is used.\n\nFairly common in the wet forests, especially near Ratnapura, the Sinha R\u0101ja forests, Pasdun K\u00f3ral\u00e9, and in the Kitulgalla forests.\n\nWood brittle, easily split, brownish-yellow, rather heavy, not durable.\n\nSometimes used for tea boxes.\n\n[Ambegamuwa, Dimbula, Southern Province.]\n\n105.\u2014El\u00e6odendron glaucum.\n\nNeralu, S. \u0db8\u0dd2\u0dbb\u0dd4; Perum-piyari, T. \u0db8\u0dd6\u0dbd\u0dca\u200d\u0dba \u0dc3\u0dd4\u0daf\u0dd4.

Papilionace\u00e6; II. Caesalpinie\u00e6; and III. Mimos\u00e6, according to the primary distinguishing characters of the flowers.\n\nSub-family Papilionace\u00e6 alone is divided into forty-seven Genera, of which only a few yield timber, while many are of use in other ways.\n\nThe Genera referred to are: Rothia, Heylandia, Croatalaria, Parochetus, Indigofera, Psoralea, Mundulea, Tephrosia, Sesbania, Zornia, Stylosanthes, Smithia, \u00c6schynomene, Ormocarpon, Eleiotis, Pycnospora, Pseudarthria, Uraria, Alyssicarpus, Desmodium, Abrus, Shuteria, Dumasia, Glycine, Teramnus, Mucuna, Erythrina, Strongylodon,\nGalactia, Butea, Canavalia, Dioclea, Phaseolus, Vigna, Clitoria, Dolichos, Atylosia, Dunbaria, Eriosema, Rhynchosia, Flemingia, Dalbergia, Pterocarpus, Pongamia, Derris, Sophora, and Pericopsis.\n\n125.\u2014*Erythrina indica.*\n\nErabadu, S. \u0d87\u0dbb\u0dcf\u0da2\u0dd4; Mullu-murukku, T. \u0db8\u0dd4\u0dbd\u0dca\u0dbd\u0dd4 \u0d9a\u0dd4\u0dbb\u0dd4\u0d9a\u0dd4.\nTrim.

Flowers very handsome, large, dark crimson, with purple keel and wings. Seed pods very swelled, and coated with fine down.\n\nConfined chiefly to the dry parts of the Provinces. Plentiful in the lower part of the Kolonna K\u00f3ral\u00e9 and near old abandoned villages.\n\nSuitable only for shade and as an ornamental tree. Wood very light and poor.\n\n[Low-country, by banks of rivers and streams.]\n127.\u2014*Pterocarpus Marsupium.*\n\nGamalu, S. \u0d9c\u0db8\u0dd4\u0dbd\u0dd4; Venkai, T. \u0dc0\u0dd9\u0db1\u0dca\u0d9a\u0dcf\u0dba.\n\nTrim.

Cey. Flor., vol. II., p. 91.\n\nA moderately large tree, with pale grayish or brownish-gray thick bark.\n\nLeaves imparipinnate (three or four pairs of leaflets and one terminal), on thick stalks attached to a rather long rachis. Thin.\n\nFlowers small, pale pink or greenish-pink, sometimes nearly white, in axillary racemes. Pod one-seeded.\n\nWidely distributed and in places fairly common, apparently introduced. Extends up to 1,800 feet in Sabaragamuwa. Often found on the bunds of old tanks in the dry districts, but never far from water.\n\nWood rather hard, pale yellowish, little used. Suitable for only very temporary work, as it is quickly destroyed\nby boring flies. Seeds afford a medicinal oil said to be used in skin diseases.\n\n[Low-country, especially near coast; common.]\n\n129.\u2014Pericopsis Mooniana.\n\nN\u0119dun, S. \u0db8\u0dd4\u0db1\u0dca.\n\nTrim. Cey. Flor., vol. II., p. 97, plate XXXI.\n\nA magnificent tree, often attaining an immense size. Stems when young pale pinkish-brown, becoming a gray-brown in old trees; rather thin. Leaves pinnate, but alternately arranged on a rather long rachis. When fresh and crushed the leaves emit a rather offensive smell. Flowers very handsome, dark purple, on stout stalks attached to large often terminal panicles. Pod rather wide, with two to six seeds of a dull red colour.\n\nThis valuable wood has a curious distribution for a water-loving plant, but possibly owing to its great value it has in places been exterminated.\n\nOccurs in a wild state in the valley of the Kelani river up to Kitulgalla, and occasionally in a few branches of that stream. Again in the valley of the Kalu-ganga up to about 1,200 feet altitude, and in the larger branches of this river in the Nawadun Koral\u00e9. Once common in Haggomuwa valley. No better property could be left as an inheritance than a plantation of N\u0119dun, as the tree runs the risk of extermination.\n\nThe wood is particularly handsome, and is well known, under its incorrectly pronounced name of \"Nandoon,\" as a common furniture timber, for which purpose it is in all ways adapted.\n\nRather heavy. Weight, about 70 lb. per cubic foot.\n\nI would add for the encouragement of those desirous of preserving this most admirable wood that it is easily grown from seed and moderately fast growing.\n\nIts preservation is greatly to be desired, especially as it is found in no other part of the world.\n\n[Formerly common, but becoming rare.]\nSub-Order II.\u2014C\u00e6salpinie\u00e6.\n\nThis very large sub-division of the Bean Family takes up ten more Genera, which include several important species.\n\nThe Genera are: C\u00e6salpinia, Peltophorum, Mezoneurum, Cassia, Cynometra, Dialium, Crudia, Saraca, Humboldtia, and Bauhinia, all mostly trees.\n\n130.\u2014Peltophorum ferrugineum.\n\nTrim.

In view of a monumental work on the Ceylonese Ebenaceae being already in hand, under the exhaustive investigations carried on by Mr. H. Wright of P\u00e9radeniya, I shall not refer to any but the better-known species in this Paper, more especially as in most cases native names are particularly unreliable in the case of this Order. It frequently follows that the presence or absence of the characteristically coloured heartwood in examples of this Family is sufficient to change its local native name, and hence it is desirable to establish the identity of each species by its anatomical characteristics\u2014a labour beyond the scope of this particular Paper.\n\n194.\u2014Maba buxifolia.\n\nKalu-habariliya, S. \u0d9a\u0dcf\u0dbd\u0dd4\u0dc4\u0db6\u0dbb\u0dd2\u0dbd\u0dd2\u0dba; Irump\u00e1lai, T. \u0d89\u0dbb\u0dd4\u0db8\u0dca\u0db4\u0dbd\u0dcf\u0dba.\nTrim.

Cey. Flor., vol. III., p. 97.\n\nA rather large tree, sometimes attaining 40 feet of clear stem. Bark dark blackish-gray, sometimes with a bluish tinge, with straight shallow longitudinal furrows.\n\nLeaves about four and a half inches long, oblong-ovate, rather pointed at base, tapering at apex, where it is bluntly pointed; rather thick, smooth, dark shining green above, pale below, often much spotted with lichenous growths.\nLateral veins minute, very fine. Stalks alternate, rather flat and short, quickly detatching when dry.\n\nFlowers (female) solitary or in pairs in axils of twigs and leaves, pale greenish-white, on stout stalks. Male not seen. Fruits large, pale bluish-green when ripe, seated on large woody calyx lobes. Seeds rather large, flatly convex, ovoid in outline, dark shining brownish-black.\n\nThe distribution of the famous Calamander wood is very restricted. It occurs in Yagir\u00eblla forest, Hewissa, and across into the Sinha R\u00e1ja forest on both slopes of the dividing range that separates the Western from the Sabaragamuwa Province. It is found at Karawita and in the Pannil Pattuwa of the Atakalan K\u00f3ral\u00e9, but is nowhere common, and is likely to become extinct, especially as it is an indigenous species, with distinct male and female trees.\n\nThe wood is the most beautiful of our ornamental timbers, being a pale purplish-brown, closely streaked with deep blackish-brown shades of varying intensity of colour. It takes an ivory-like polish of brilliant lustre, and is unrivalled as a cabinet wood. Weight, about 54 lb. per cubic foot.\n\nA very slow-growing plant, and probably requiring very special conditions to secure its survival.\n\n198.\u2014Diospyros insignis.\n\nPorowamalla, S. \u0db8\u0dd4\u0dbd\u0dca\u0dbd\u0dcf.\n\nTrim.

Lateral veins prominent below, with transparent intermediate nerving.\n\nFlowers pale violet, often bluish, numerous, small, arranged in loose terminal panicles; fruits small, dark purple, often spotted.\n\nVery common in both Provinces up to 3,000 feet in both wet and dry zones, but perhaps more abundant in the latter, where it attains a larger size than in the wet districts.\n\nA most valuable timber. Wood hard, close, even-grained, very durable, of a pale brownish-gray colour, often yellowish,\nespecially when fresh. The weight rather varies, as will be seen from the following:\n\nGamble gives two examples, 56 lb. and 49 lb.\nImperial Institute, 60\u00b792 lb.\nConservator's collection, 55 lb.\nDo. do. 60 lb.\nMy own collection, 52 lb.\nDo. do. 50\u00b771 lb.\n\nNo better wood can be found for work requiring resistance to exposure; it is therefore suitable for bridge planks, beams, posts, door frames, shingles, and also oil casks.\n\nThe bark affords an embrocation used in rheumatism.\n\n219.\u2014Vitex alata.*\n\nNative names as in last.\nTrim Cey.

Readily distinguished by the large fleshy fruit, which on opening exposes the solitary brown seed enclosed within a brilliantly-coloured aril.\n\nVery common throughout the wet forests of both Provinces up to 5,000 feet, but rarely found in the dry zone. During the fruit season it affords a favourite food for the Hill Mynah, which not infrequently swallows the seed whole.\n\nThe wood is a pale brownish-straw colour, very straight-grained, soft, easily split, and smooth. Weight, about 24 lb. per cubic foot; not durable. Very well suited for tea boxes.\nor cigar boxes, but requires to be carefully loft-seasoned, otherwise it rots quickly.

Leaves long, about twelve inches, alternate, lanceolate, tapering to extremities, smooth, rather pale green, attached by very short stalks. Easily recognized by the large clusters of reddish-brown hairy fruits, which are pink within, exposing a circular seed entirely covered by a bright scarlet aril (mace).\nVery common in wet places in both Provinces up to 1,500 feet, and often found by swamps and abandoned paddy fields.\n\nThe wood is grayish, rather close-grained, and takes a good polish. Weight, about 40 lb. per cubic foot. In much demand for tea boxes, mine planks, &c., but is not durable. The Andaman species affords a handsome heavy wood.\n\n**LAURACE\u00c6.**\n\nThis large Order, which includes our well-known Cinnamon, is represented by ten Genera: Cryptocarya, Beilschmiedia, Cinnamomum, Machilus, Alseodaphne, Actinodaphne, Litsea, Lindera, Cassytha, and Hernandia.\n\nA very troublesome Order to distinguish species by, owing to the specific differences being sometimes only microscopic in the flower.\n\n225.\u2014CRYPTOCARYA MEMBRANACEA.\n\nGal-mora, S. \u0d9c\u0ddd\u0dbb, S.\n\nTrim.

Flowers small, pale yellow, arranged in loose panicles. Fruits \"about half an inch, oblong-ovoid, surrounded by much enlarged perianth, minutely apiculate, dry or slightly fleshy, dark purple.\"\u2014Trimen.\n\nOccurs sparingly in the wet forests of both Provinces up to 3,000 feet. I have obtained examples from the Sinha R\u00e1ja forest with enormous leaves (fifteen inches by five inches), but I have observed that this is a very variable quality.\n\nThe well known spice is obtained from this species, as well as cinnamon oil, which is distilled from the bark and the leaves. The root affords a form of camphor, obtained by distillation, but is inferior to the camphor of China.\n\nThe yearly exports of cinnamon bark from Ceylon amount to nearly 5,000,000 lb., having advanced to nearly twelve times the quantity exported sixty years ago. According to the Customs Report, for 1899 the export of cinnamon from Ceylon amounted to 5,501,096 lb., valued at Rs. 2,760,692\u00b745.*\n\n227.\u2014CINNAMOMUM CITRIODORUM.\n\nPe\u1e45giri-kuru\u1e47du, S. \u0dc3\u0dd9\u0dc3\u0dca \u0db8\u0dcf\u0dbb\u0dd2\u0dba.\nTrim.

Fruits about one inch, ovoid, tapering to apex, on which the remains of the styles are generally present.\nVery common in the Pasdun K\u00f3ral\u00e9 of the Western Province, extending into the Kuku\u013cu K\u00f3ral\u00e9 in Sabaragamuwa. Often attaining a considerable size.\n\nWood rather handsome brownish-red, but worthless for any permanent work, and perhaps best suited for fuel.

Trim. Cey. Flor., vol. IV., p. 46.\n\nA large tree, with pale grayish bark, and conspicuous for its silvery-gray foliage and large three-lobed fruits.\n\nThis is an introduced species, and is found abundantly in native gardens in the moist zone of both Provinces, and in the Central Province up to about 2,000 feet. It yields a very large quantity of oil from the seed, and in consequence is known as the \"Candle-nut\" tree. Of late years the wood, which is pale greenish-white in colour, and light, has been largely employed for the manufacture of tea boxes, but is not very suitable for that purpose, as it is foul-smelling and quickly decaying.\n\nThe chief value of the plant lies in its oil-bearing capacity, for which it is worthy of more general consideration.\n\n243.\u2014Croton lacciferus.\n\nKeppetiya, S. \u0d9a\u0dda\u0db4\u0dca\u0db4\u0da7\u0dd2\u0dba. Trim. Cey. Flor., vol. IV., p. 48.\n\nA shrub, with thin pale gray bark finely coated with hair. Leaves alternate, rather irregular in size, from three to four inches long, broadly ovate, often lobed, caudate at base, suddenly acuminate, with rather jagged margin. Finely hairy on both surfaces, more so on the under side. Lateral veins and nerves conspicuous. Two small wart-like glands always present at base of blade on the leaf-stalk. Stalks about two inches, very hairy, easily detached.\nFlowers small, with densely hairy fruits.\n\nVery common in all parts of both Provinces up to 2,000 feet, especially in abandoned chenas.\n\nIt is much prized by the natives for the sake of its leaves, which when rotted afford a valuable manure used in betel-gardens (bulath-kottu). The leaves are also frequently used as a material for wrapping jaggery balls, while, according to Trimen, a red coccid occurs on the bark of the older trees that produces a lac collected for the Kandyan lacquer industry. I have not seen this coccid, but I am informed that the yellow juice of the young twigs and leaf-stalks is collected by rubbing the wounded or broken surfaces of such parts together, and in that way a resinous mass is obtained that is said to be of great value.\n\n244.\u2014Ostodes zeylanica.\n\nVel-k\u0113kuna, S. \u0db8\u0dd2\u0dc1\u0dca\u0dbb\u0dd3\u0db8.\nTrim.

Fruit very fig-like, axillary, often growing on old wood near the base of the tree.\n\nCommon in both Provinces in the wet forests up to 3,500 feet. Often found near swamps.\n\nAffords a very useful substitute for sandpaper in its hispid leaves, an allied species\u2014*F. asperrima*\u2014doing the same. The wood is worthless.\n\nI have considered it undesirable to include all the well-known Banyan trees in this list, for though they are of interest botanically, and on account of their appreciation as religiously venerated plants, most of our Ceylon examples find no other use beyond ornament. The familiar B\u00f3 (*Ficus religiosa*), so intimately associated with Buddhist temples (and said to have spread artificially from the historical tree at Anur\u00e1dhapura, that has a record as far back as 288 B.C.), and the stately spreading Banyan (*Ficus*\nBengalensis), are both common representatives of this Genera, but are not used for the sake of their timber.\n\nFicus elastica, or India rubber, has been introduced to Ceylon, but has not been generally cultivated.\n\n256.\u2014Antiaris toxicaria (UPAS TREE).\n\nRiti, S. 88.\nTrim.

It is deservedly popular\nfor the sake of its most excellent timber, which is used for all manner of furniture and for house-building. Weight, 42 to 45 lb. The fruits are eaten, and likewise the seeds; in fact it is one of the few trees we have in Ceylon of which no part is lost, or need be. The wood supplies a dye for colouring Buddhist priests' robes, in addition to its use as a timber.\n\nAbove 4,000 feet the Jak does not flourish well, and plantations of this species if left to abandonment seemingly die out.\n\nThe famous Breadfruit (A. incisa) is another familiar example of this Genus, but is cultivated only for the sake of its fruit. Its timber is practically worthless.\n\nPALME\u00c6.\n\nThis valuable Order, so characteristic of the tropics, is represented by ten Genera: Areca, Loxococcus, Oncosperma, Caryota, Nipa, Phoenix, Corypha, Calamus, Borassus, and Cocos.

Cey. Flor., vol. IV., p. 336.\n\nIt is hardly necessary to describe this well-known tree. It is not common in either the Western or Sabaragamuwa Province, though it occurs occasionally up to 1,200 feet, but nowhere in a wild state.\n\nThe wood forming the outer portion of the stem is hard, dark, very strong, and durable, but of variable weight, usually about 62 lb. per cubic foot. The wood affords excellent rafters and laths, and can be worked up into handsome furniture. The scope of this Paper will not\nadmit of a full description of the manifold uses of the Palmyra, of which an exhaustive account is to be found in a work entitled \"The Palmyra Palm,\" by the late W. Ferguson, first published in 1850.\n\n[Dry region and sandy tracts near coast; very common.]\n\n270.\u2014Cocos nucifera (COCOANUT PALM).\n\nPol, S. \u0db8\u0dd4\u0dbd\u0dca; Tennamaram, T. \u0db8\u0dd4\u0dbd\u0dca.\n\nTrim.

IV., p. 337.\n\nThe characteristic palm of the low-country of Ceylon, and pretty well planted in every native garden up to 2,500 feet.\n\nIts uses and purposes are innumerable, and it is about the only plant known of which every part is of use to man.\n\nThe outer wood of the stem is very hard, close, and durable. Weight, about 72 lb. per cubic foot. Affords excellent timber for rafters and roofing, and is often made into very handsome furniture.\n\nThe importance of the Cocoanut Palm in Ceylon may best be appreciated by reference to the following

ADDITION.\n\nOn page 105, line 7 from bottom, for \"rarely poison any\" read \"rarely contain any.\"\n\nNo. 197.\u2014Since this Paper went to press I have obtained examples of the male flower of the Calamander, at Karawita-kanda, in Sabaragamuwa. These are white, with green, rather ovoid calyx-tube, in small nodding clusters, easily detached. Leaves in the male tree of this species are much smaller than in the female.\nCOUNCIL MEETING.\n\nColombo Museum, July 3, 1902.\n\nPresent:\n\nHis Excellency the Hon.

that, however, they have received later news from the Netherlands, according to which the whole of Portugal had revolted from Spain, and the Duke of Braganza had been chosen and crowned King of Portugal; that forasmuch as [ ] they have ordered the said Mathys Quast, if there were any chance of success, to try his fortune against the town of Goa or one of its chief fortresses (which command the town); but, if he should see no advantage there, or if the enemy, on the approach of so powerful a fleet, should have recalled his men from Ceylon in order to defend Goa, in consequence of which Columbo would not be duly provided and its garrison weakened; or also, if Galle should have been reduced to extremity; he should have to go to Ceylon with the greater part of his forces in order to assist us and harass the enemy, holding Goa duly blockaded before leaving the same with his ships;

also respecting the chances of success and the number of men that would be wanted in order to conquer the said place without the aid of the King of Candy, and also to assist Galle [ ] just as last year he has had our help at Alycan,\u00b9 and by what\n\n\u00b9 Alutgama.\nmeans this had better be done, in order that the said Commander Quast may be fully informed thereof;\n\nTherefore the Lord President has set forth these matters to his assembled Council and therewith [ ] to write to Commander Quast all these things in detail.\n\nAll which having been fully weighed by the said Council, they have by a majority of votes resolved, approved, and determined to send the following communication and advice to the afore-mentioned Commander Quast, who, being informed of the same, can decide upon it with his Council, as they shall think fit and advisable to be done for the greatest advantage of the East India Company; to wit\u2014\n\nFirst, respecting the enemy's situation and forces in this Island of Ceylon, as we have been told by two Portuguese deserters and some \"blacks,\" their forces consist of from 900 to 1,000 whites, besides the married men at Columbo, who probably number 500 whites;\n\nMS. page 11.\n\nbut the soldiers are divided into three encampments, one of these being at Saffregam; one near this place, made up of 14 distancis,\\(^1\\) some of them of 20, some of 22, and others of 24 men; and the third lying at Manicareware;\\(^2\\) besides a great number of Cingalese and \"blacks,\" whom by violence as well as persuasion they have brought under their rule, as they still do every day;\n\nand we do not believe that Dom Philip Mas.,\\(^3\\) General at Columbo, will send any of them to Goa, as he does not know about our fleet, and, if he suspects anything, he will probably be afraid that he is to be attacked;\n\nAs respects the state of affairs at Columbo, since the [ ] of the faithless and dishonourable Count de Vertamane, it has been much fortified, with a moat round\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Companies?\n\n\\(^2\\) Probably Menikkadawara in the K\u00e9galla District.\n\n\\(^3\\) Mascarenhas.\nthe town on the landside and other fastnesses and trenches in certain streets inside the place, so that we think that at least 2,000 soldiers would be wanted to conquer the said town without the aid of Raja Singa;\n\nAs respects Raja Singa [ ]\n\nas he pretends that during the three years' [war], which the Dutch have carried on in this Island, his people have been greatly weakened, to which should be added the consequent revolt of his brother the Prince of Uva against him; and even if Raja should join us with a considerable power, yet none of them would venture to remain with us, but they would all take to flight, as this perfidious people have before done at the taking of Galle; for during the siege not one of them showed himself, but as soon as the town had been taken they came forth in great numbers from the wood (where they had lain concealed to watch how matters would turn out between us and the Portuguese) not omitting to murder and plunder, so that we think it of little moment whether we have the assistance of the Cingalese or not.\n\nTouching the present situation of their king we are unable to give any particulars, as we have received no letters from him on this point.\n\nMS. page 12.\n\nIt will be hardly possible to get the cinnamon under the present circumstances, for the Portuguese carried it to Columbo, as soon as it was cut and prepared, and have been much quicker about it than Raja Singa was last year, when he had to provide us.\n\nWe understand that shortly after the capture, the enemy had removed the best pieces of artillery from the fortress of Negumbo and left a small garrison only in the place to serve as a defence against the Cingalese only, so that we surmise it could offer little resistance; still the attack would have to\nbe made by surprise and stratagem, for the enemy, learning of our arrival, and suspecting we might be minded to attempt the place, will no doubt concentrate all their forces there (which they could do in three or four days at most) and prevent any successful undertaking on our part.\n\nAs respects the town of Galle, we trust that, with the help of God, we shall be able with our present garrison, which at present, reinforced with the 30 men from Coromandel, 10 from Battecaloa, and 25 from Batavia, who came to us a few days ago, numbers more than 400 men, to resist the enemy, if he should be minded to attempt anything against us, so that we see no difficulty in the preservation and defence of this place.\n\nActum Galle, datum ut supra.

and since, lastly, we also fully know what the Honourable Governor-General and Council of India have successively let us know by their letters touching the subject of the war in these parts\u2014\nWhether it would be advisable to effect a landing, to attack the force of the enemy and make an attempt on the aforesaid fortress of Negumbo, or whether, on the contrary, we had better let the matter stand and not undertake anything;\n\nThe Lord President at the same time urging the members of the Council, together and each of them in particular\u2014having previously represented to them both the perils which might arise out of it, and the eminent service which by it might be rendered to the Honourable Company\u2014duly to weigh the said enterprise and diligently take it to heart, forasmuch as the well-being or miscarriage of the Company in the Island of Ceylon, as well as our credit or dishonour was chiefly dependent on it.\n\nAll which having been duly and attentively weighed by the Councillors and friends assembled, and it having been considered that\u2014\n\nas in sailing hither we had not been\n\nso fortunate and quick as we had wished, the only causes of this being the head winds and counter currents sent us by God Almighty, which have also prevented us from going out of sight of the land (as we had resolved), for fear we should be driven too far out to sea and thus altogether balked of our purpose\u2014\n\nThe enemy has doubtless closely observed us;

that they have no doubt strengthened the garrison in the said fortress; and that we should not succeed in effecting a landing without experiencing violent resistance and running\ngreat risk of being repelled and driven back\u2014which is the less desirable, as our strength is by no means considerable\u2014a storming and taking of the said fortress being altogether out of the question.\n\nMS. page 59.\n\nAlso that, supposing the said fortress be captured and, in accordance with their Worships' orders, dismantled and altogether razed, yet we shall not be able to maintain ourselves as masters of the surrounding country, and therefore can never lay claim to any jurisdiction in those parts\u2014the less so, as the enemy can easily throw up another fastness, which the Cingalese will be unable to prevent on account of the strong power which, as aforesaid, the enemy has now brought together; it being also to be feared that the enemy, seeing his fortress lost, will most probably attempt to indemnify himself for the damage suffered, to rally his forces and give us battle, be it in the open field or when we shall be re-embarking our forces, which battle might easily fall out disastrously for us, forasmuch as the landing, storming, and capturing of the fortress cannot fail to be attended with loss, disabling and weakening of men on our part;\n\nFurthermore, that this matter may easily be explained to the King of Candy, without injury to the Company's credit and reputation, if we tell him that we had counted on his coming down to us with his army, which he up to this time having failed to do,\n\nMS. page 60.\n\nthe right time for undertaking anything of moment has gone by, and other reasons of the like nature;\n\nIt has been approved of and resolved by majority of votes not to undertake any landing or any attempt against the enemy, as we are of opinion that under the present circumstances and for reasons above detailed no advantage would accrue to the Company from an attack on the enemy and on\nthe fortress aforesaid, but contrariwise dishonour, loss of reputation, peril to our ships and soldiers, nay, great danger of losing the town of Galle, which has been conquered with so much glory;\n\nWherefore we think it best to fortify the said town of Galle as much as possible, and to employ this fleet on the Coast of Coromandel (as the Lord Governor-General and Council of India have frequently desired in their letters) or in some other place where the enemy may be attacked with a better chance of success;

and that so soon as the enemy had made the first charge our men had got into confusion, so that some of them took to flight, and the others wishing to maintain their ground got likewise into disorder through these fugitives, and began to run away, insomuch that no one could be got to stand firm and make head against the enemy again; and forasmuch as it clearly appears from what has been heretofore said, that they, the prisoners, as faithless and dishonourable cowards, got rid of their arms, did not resist the enemy, and shamefully forsook the field they had already almost conquered, abandoned the faithful officers and soldiers who kept firm (and who have most of them paid their fidelity with their lives); this being a matter of very hurtful consequence, inasmuch as not only thereby the good name and character of the Dutch have got into great disrepute with our enemy, the Portuguese, and our allies and friends, the Cingalese, and contrariwise the aforesaid enemy has got into great consideration with the \"blacks\";\n\nMS. page 135.\n\nbut, moreover, if they had kept the field, as they stood a good chance of doing, seeing that the enemy had already been once forced to retreat, the said enemy would not have ventured to stay in these parts, in such wise that the country hereabouts might have become open, and we might have got some provisions from the outside; whereas now, on the contrary, they are likely to invest us even more closely than\nthey have done heretofore; all which should not be tolerated in a town where justice and the law are administered (forasmuch as such misdemeanours, according to all martial laws, are punished with the halter until death shall ensue), but as an example to others should be, in the most rigorous manner, punished;\n\nTherefore the Lord President and the Council aforesaid, having read the papers and proofs incriminating the conduct of the said prisoners, having heard their free confession, having furthermore ripely considered and weighed all that is pertinent to this matter and has been allowed to move their Worships' minds,\n\nAdministering justice in the name of the Supreme Authority, but preferring mercy to the utmost rigour of the law, have thought fit from certain motives, and in doubt whether all of them are equally culpable, to let the prisoners draw lots, and to have the six men who shall be pointed out by this lottery punished with arquebuses, in such wise that death shall ensue, together with confiscation of all monthly payments still due to them; in pursuance of which the aforesaid prisoners having drawn lots, the lot has fallen on the men hereafter named, viz., Jan Landtsknecht, Hendrick Jansz, constable, Aris Wynders, Carel Jacobsz, Asmus Jansz, and Joost Claesz Boot, of Gorcum;\n\nMS. page 136.\n\nBut the delinquents having promised to beware of such acts in future, together with other reasons moving their Worships' minds in this matter, they have, thereto incited by mercy and clemency, resolved to let four out of the six delinquents go free, and then to let the law have its course in regard to the remaining two and cause them to be executed.\n\nThus given and resolved in the town of Galle, this 12th day of August, and sentence pronounced on the 13th following.\n\n(Signed) Jan Thysen, Marten Vinck, [ ], Gerrit Moutmaker, Frans Maetsuicher, Jan van der Laen, Lambert Camholt.\nVOLUME II.\n\nMonday, March 12, 1640 A.D.\u00b9\n\nMS. fol.

I have just been fortunate enough to discover, in a pile of loose, unsorted manuscript lying among the Dutch archives in my charge, an additional leaf from the same lost volume, of which I here append a translation.\n\n\"Saturday, March 17, 1640 A.D.\u2014Whereas the Mudaliyars of His Imperial Majesty have earnestly begged for an exact half of the spoil obtained from the conquered town of Galle on the strength of the promise made by us to His Majesty, the Heer President has submitted to the Council the question as to whether or not this should be granted to them: Whereupon, after due deliberation, and considering that by the non-fulfilment of this promise (although no assistance was rendered in this siege by His Majesty's soldiery or coolies) other and fresh troubles may be expected, it is unanimously agreed (dis, the Heer Majoor, who maintains that the matter ought to be submitted for the approval of the Honourable the Governor-General) that all the property, both ammunition and general goods, being collected together, a half thereof be given to His Majesty's Mudaliyars.\n\n\"Further, whereas the Skipper Pieter van de Camer has, in virtue of the leave obtained by him, applied for permission to depart for Batavia by the first ships going thither, it is resolved to grant him this and to appoint the Skipper Lieven van Souwenburch in his place on the yacht 'De Star.'\n\n\"It is also resolved that as there are residing here many mystice widows, as well as a few unmarried women, to grant to such of the soldiers as may apply for it, permission to marry these and thus prevent all future unpleasantness.\n\n\"Further, whereas we find ourselves overcrowded by Portuguese prisoners, and it is deemed injudicious to allow any of them to reside here, in view of the weakness of our garrison, it is resolved, by a majority of votes, to furnish each of the ships going to Malacca with 25 Portuguese prisoners of war.\n\n\"It has been decided in Council, at the same time, that as the ships 'Haarlem,' 'Utrecht,' 'Middelburgh,' and 'De Veer' have, on account of adverse circumstances, been very lightly loaded, to put on each of them half a legger (350 kans) of the Spanish wine obtained from Saragossa.\"\nGale,\u00b9 and the enemy are nightly filling up with palm trees and osier-work the breaches made by us in the daytime, without our being able to prevent them from doing the same;\n\nAnd as it is greatly to be feared that the besieged will find means to strengthen themselves more and more on those points where they have to expect our attacks; therefore at the instance and proposal of the Lord Commander it has been unanimously resolved to storm this place, in the name of God, to-morrow early before daybreak, in manner following, to wit:\n\nThe general storming party to consist of four detachments; first the vanguard commanded by the Commissary Jan Thysen, to attack with all possible means the point of St. Ascension,\u00b2 and to conquer it with the help of God; this vanguard to consist of [ ] companies of Dutchmen and [ ] ditto \u201cblacks.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is also permitted that Mr. Gerard Herbers departing from here with the ships \u2018Middleburch\u2019 and \u2018Utrecht\u2019 for Batavia, shall during his voyage carry the flag on the main-topmast and have precedence accordingly.\n\nLastly, whereas the Honourable Philippus Lucasz, did, at his departure, recommend to the Heer President that the lads serving on His Honour\u2019s boat and drawing not more than 4 guilders per month should be promoted on account of their special services, they are accordingly advanced in salary as follows:\u2014\n\n\u201cHuybert Huybertsz of Haarlem, cabin boy (midshipman?), who arrived here in the year 1637 by the ship \u2018Amsterdam\u2019 on 4 guilders per month, is, for the foregoing consideration, advanced to mariner with a salary of 8 guilders per month, and as such to continue to serve out his ten years\u2019 bond.\n\n\u201cIsaac Huygen of Middelburg, who arrived here by the ship \u2018Henriette Louyse\u2019 in the year 1637 as a cabin boy, on 4 guilders per month, is, as above, advanced to 8 guilders per month.\n\nThus done and resolved in the Fort of Galle datum ut supra.

B.\n\nIt having further been considered whether we shall, pursuant to the orders of the Honourable Phs. Lucas,\\(^2\\) send to Batavia the ship \"Boeyen,\" with ulterior advices of what has happened between us and the Ceylonese Magistrate, it has been resolved,\n\nforasmuch as the said magistrate has not delivered into our hands any missive such as the Honourable Phs. Lucas had supposed,\n\nto keep here the said ship \"Boeyen\" until we shall, with the aid of God, have terminated our attempt on Galle, after which she shall convey to Batavia, together with the preceding advices, also a report of our doings against Galle.\n\n\\(^1\\) Probably the present \"Moon Bastion,\" the Middel Punt according to Valentyn.\n\n\\(^2\\) Philippus Lucasz was the Director-General of the expedition against the Portuguese in the Indian seas. Falling ill, however, early in the course of events, and dying shortly after at Batavia (5th March, 1640), the chief command of the army, both on land and sea, fell to Willem Jacobsz Coster.\nThus done and resolved on board the ship \"Utrecht,\" datum ut supra.

Many translations of letters, reports, and resolutions relating to his short rule and his tragic death have appeared in the Ceylon Literary Register, to the pages of which the reader is referred.\n\n\u00b2 Adriaan Anthonisz (Anthonizoon) was appointed Field Marshall of the army and second person of the expedition under Coster. He had previously served with Lucasz at the taking of Negombo. Shortly after the conquest of Galle he was entrusted with the command of the land and sea forces against Malacca, which he conquered for the Dutch, losing his life the same year through illness brought on by exertion and fatigue. Valentyn describes him as an old, experienced, and bold soldier\u2014een oud, ervaren en stout krygsman (see Cey. Lit. Reg., vol. II., page 119; Valentyn, Beschryving v. Malakka, page 340).\n\n\u00b3 The news of the conquest of Galle, which the Dutch at once made the headquarters of their Government, was carried to Batavia by the ships \"Middelburch\" and \"Utrecht,\" which also conveyed Mr. Gerard Herbers as the Council's emissary. The victory was gained by the Dutch, \"not without great bloodshed on both sides,\" and the number of prisoners taken was about 700 natural-born Portuguese with their wives and children. The event was celebrated in Batavia with a great military display followed by a thanksgiving service in Church (see Cey. Lit. Reg., vol. II., page 118).\nSo that our deliberations may tend to the honour and glory of Thy name, to the welfare of our beloved country, to the benefit of our neighbours, together with the prosperity and well-being of our chiefs and of those who have entrusted these things unto us;\n\nAll this we entreat of Thee, in the name of Thy Son Jesus Christ, Who has taught us to pray as follows:\n\nOur Father, &c.,\n\nDe Vogel.\\(^1\\)\n\nThursday, August 28, 1642.\n\nMS. fol. 1.\n\nWhereas the Lord President and the Council of this town, having on the 29th March last sailed from this place for Coromandel by way of Battecaloa in the fleet commanded by the Honourable Captains Cornelis Leendersz Blaeuw and Dominicus Bouwens respectively, had intimated to the Lord Governor Arent Gardenys, that in the month of September next they would send thither one of the yachts lying in this Bay, in order to fetch thence certain necessaries for the use of this garrison,\n\nthe Lord President has submitted to his Council the question\n\nWhich yacht would be best suited for this purpose;\n\nWhereupon the aforesaid Council having duly considered that the yacht \"Limmen\" should especially remain here, seeing that the said yacht is the strongest and best equipped of the three, not only to protect this bay against the enemy's attacks by sea, but also in due time to harass the said enemy in all possible ways in the roads of Columbo, and to intercept any reinforcement that should be sent out to them from Goa, which reinforcements cannot, we trust, at all be considerable,\n\n\\(^1\\) This was probably the name of a clergyman who accompanied the expedition. His name does not appear in the list given in Valentyn, *Zaaken van den Godtsdienst op Ceylon*, page 460, which begins two years later with Antonius Hornhovius, 1642.\nIt has been unanimously resolved and agreed upon that the yacht \"De Star\" be despatched to Coromandel as quickly as possible;\n\nFurthermore, that, if the said yacht \"De Star\" on arriving before Battecaloa should not get any advices or any goods from King Raja Singa, and after two or three days' delay should not see any likelihood thereof, the yacht \"Rommerswael\" shall sail together with the said \"Star\"; all this with a view of the fact that the said yacht \"De Star\" is not likely to have shiproom enough to take in all she shall be in want of.\n\nThu sresolved and approved of in the town of Sta.

that from 10 to 12 elephants' tusks, 81 cattis of tortoise-shell, 3 pieces of scarlet cloth shall be taken out of the said \"Banda\" and be put on board one of the Suratta ships, and that all the tin in the ship \"Delfshaven\" shall be put on board the \"Leeuwerick.\"\n\nThe Uppermerchant Mr. Pieter Pacts and the merchant Mr. Gerrit Moutmaker are by these presents appointed and deputed to visit all the ships of the fleet, and to inquire what provisions of rice and hard bread they have on board, to the intent that if possible the scarcity of the same at Point de Galle may be relieved.\n\nMS. fol. 22.\n\nAs to the second point mentioned, regard being had to the little power we have, for introducing such a toll there (Batticaloa), and the danger that trouble might easily arise therefrom, seeing the terms on which we now are with the King of Candy,\n\nIt has been unanimously resolved, not to take any steps in this matter for the present, but to leave matters alone\nuntil such time as we shall certainly know how we stand with Raja Singa.\n\nAs to the third point, whereas we have not received notice in due form from the Portuguese of the Truce concluded, and the approval of the same, but only, on the 4th October, 1642 A.D., Dom Philippo de Mascarenho, General of Columbo, sent to the Lord President Jan Thysen, a copy of the articles of the truce and of the ratification by Dom Jan, which had been despatched before the counter-ratification of the States had been issued, and which has consequently been considered null and void, the more so as it was not accompanied by any formal assent of the States-General.\n\nIt has been resolved that the Uppermerchant Marten Vinck shall set sail for Columbo on the 5th instant in the yacht \"Rommerswael,\" in order to give notice there of the afore-mentioned ten years' truce concluded between Dom Jan the Fourth, King of Portugal, Algarvia, &c., and Their High Mightinesses the States-Generals of the United Netherlands, and to signify unto the authorities at Columbo the ratifications mutually exchanged, giving them to understand at the same time, that on accepting our notification of the said truce, they will be bound to evacuate and cede to us the country about Galle, which at the present moment they are still holding, together with such matters as shall be set forth at length in the instructions given by the Commissioner to the said Uppermerchant Mr. Marten Vinck, who shall as soon as possible return hither and give a report of his mission; Lastly the Lord President Jan Thysen has proposed to the Council, whereas on the first of this month the\n\nMS. fol. 23.\n\nyachts \"Limmen\" and \"Rommerswael\" were under way with destination for our fleet before the roads of Goa, in order to procure, through Commander Jan Dircksze Gale, some\nprovisions and other necessaries, chiefly rice, with which we were very scantily provided in the town of Galle;\n\n[Which yachts being still in sight of Galle, at the arrival of the fleet of His Excellency the Commissioner, signals were made to them, on which they are straightways returned;\n\nAnd though through the arrival of the Lord Commissioner we have received considerable supplies, still owing to the increase of the garrison, scarcity is likely soon to set in again];\n\nWhether it would therefore not be advisable again to send out the yacht \"Limmen\" on the same errand;\n\nUpon which it has been resolved that the said yacht \"Limmen\" shall set sail for the place mentioned in company with the ships \"Pauw\" and \"Leeuwerick,\" and try to get there whatever can be got for Point de Galle, especially rice, even to an amount of 80 or more lasts, seeing that such provision is urgently needed, in order to enable us to keep here certain coolies and lascorins from the circumjacent country, to whom it might be distributed;\n\nEverything mentioned tending to the service of the Company, and the well-being of this town and garrison.\n\nThus done and resolved in the town of Sta.

whether, as heretofore,\n\nMS. fol. 34.\n\nthey shall each month have a certain quantity of rice given out to them, or whether we shall let this matter rest for the present.\n\nAll which having been maturely weighed by the afore-said Council, they have unanimously approved, resolved, and concluded, in manner as hereunder following:\n\nAs touching the first point: that, forasmuch as hitherto little or nothing from the outside is offered for sale here, so that officers will not be able to do without the provisions in the Company's warehouses, the following tariff of prices shall be fixed:\nRice to be sold for $\\frac{3}{8}$ pieces-of-eight per 40 pounds.\nMeat and bacon, one or the other, for $\\frac{1}{8}$ piece-of-eight per pound.\nDutch butter, $\\frac{1}{4}$ piece-of-eight per pound.\nBengal or coast ditto, 4 stivers per pound.\nWine, for $\\frac{3}{4}$ pieces-of-eight per pewter-measure.\\(^1\\)\nBlack sugar, for 4 pieces-of-eight per picol.\\(^2\\)\nJava beans, for $\\frac{5}{8}$ pieces-of-eight per parra.\\(^3\\)\n\nMS. fol. 35.\n\nBatavia arrack, for $\\frac{1}{4}$ pieces-of-eight per pewter-measure.\nPadi, $\\frac{1}{9}$ piece-of-eight per parra or 40 pounds.\nDutch vinegar, $\\frac{1}{4}$ piece-of-eight per pewter-measure.\nChinaware and iron pans, sent hither from Tayoan, one per cent. above the price paid for them by the Company.\n\nAnd, although the aforesaid officers have reason to be satisfied with the board-wages allowed them at this place, as at other places in India, still the Lord President, with the sanction of their Worships the Governor-General and the Council of India, has further allowed to each of those who have a seat in the Council, as he allows by these presents, 24 cocoanut trees, and to the others, as Lieutenants, Ensigns, Undermerchants, Comforters of the sick, and the Surgeon, 10 ditto; in order to draw from these oil for the lamps, sury\\(^4\\) for baking rice-cakes or apas, and other necessaries; all this with a view to the circumstance that, as aforesaid, nothing is as yet brought in for sale here from the outside, and all these are things which are quite indispensable in housekeeping;\n\nMS. fol. 36.\n\nFurthermore, the Council has resolved that as soon as possible, outside the town but close by, a bazaar shall be\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Probably the same as a han = a litre.\n\\(^2\\) A picol was somewhat more than 130 lb.\n\\(^3\\) A parra was equal to 40 lb.\n\\(^4\\) Toddy, used as yeast.\nestablished for the convenience of the garrison, more especially of the officers hereinbefore mentioned; that some well-reputed soldier shall be entrusted with the office of bazaar-keeper, who shall have to prevent as far as possible any irregularities and disputes that should arise between our men and the Cingalese, while buying and selling their wares.\n\nAs touching the second point; it has been resolved to send out to Batavia, about the middle of March next, the yacht \"De Star,\" seeing that the same is grievously damaged, and its outer coating gnawed through by worms to such an extent that, unless it be repaired, which cannot be done here, it will be unseaworthy in a very short time; and considering furthermore that it is highly desirable that their Worships at Batavia should be made acquainted with the position of affairs here, and with what has taken place here after the departure of the Lord Commissioner Pieter Boreel.\n\nAs touching the third and last point; it has been resolved that the monthly distribution of\n\nMS. fol. 37.\n\nrice to such lascorins and their wives and other \"blacks\" in this town, as are willing to work for us, shall again be resumed, seeing that in future the Honourable Company will not be able to draw any profit from this country without the help and assistance of the natives aforesaid, and considering that their Worships at Batavia and the Lord Commissioner Boreel in his instruction have given orders to this effect.\n\nLastly, it having been considered how little cattle we have at present in this town, and that the men of the garrison (who up to this time have been fain to put up with their scanty rations) are justly entitled to have some fresh meat provided for them, especially the new comers, who, being unused to the climate of this country, are liable to many infirmities and diseases,\n\nIt has been resolved, that as soon as an opportunity shall offer the Lord President shall by letter request the Captain\nMoor of the Portuguese army encamped in the neighbourhood to let us have, against due payment, so many buffaloes and cows as he shall be able to dispense with; which cattle will always be welcome here, whether the peace should continue or war break out again.\n\nGerrit Dircksz of Amsterdam,\n\nMS. fol. 38.\n\narrived in India in 1636 in the ship \"Banda,\" as a hanger-on\\(^1\\) on a pay of 5 guilders per month, at present serving as an Adelborst on a salary of 11 guilders monthly, is, at his request and considering his ability, by these presents appointed bazaar keeper, on a pay of 16 guilders per month, the advance beginning this day.\n\nJan Claesz of Leeuwarden, arrived in India in [ ] as a [ ] on a pay of [ ] guilders monthly, at present serving as a corporal, is, at his request, considering his capacities and his skill, and seeing that such an officer is urgently needed in this garrison, by these presents promoted to the rank of Captain Carnis (?) on a salary of 18 guilders per month, the improvement beginning this day.\n\nGerrit Steen Cicker of Alen, arrived in this country in 1637 in the ship \"N.

harassing of the enemy be sent to some other place, still in that case the said yacht, supposing it could not come hither, might proceed to Battecaloa and cruise there until the setting in of the

The general drift of our resolution is, that on receipt of the present letter, the officers mentioned in the said resolution shall continue suspended from their rank, pay, and rations during your Lordship's and the Council's pleasure, until such time as they shall by good conduct have made good the faults by them committed; and to give them an opportunity for so doing it is understood that also while suspended the said officers shall perform their accustomed duties; until as aforesaid they shall have amended their misdemeanours by better services, or your Lordship and the Council shall think fit to reinstate them as before.\"\n\nIt having further been considered that since it appears from the above that their Worships at Batavia have been graciously pleased to leave the case of the said officers to the\ndecision of the Lord President and his Council; and since the receipt of their aforesaid Worships' order, we have, to our sincere regret, not had a single opportunity for gaining the least advantage over the enemy either with large or small sallying parties, seeing that for four or five months past the enemy has, so to say, not moved an inch from Hackmiene, their fortified camping place,\n\nMS. fol. 98.\n\nas we have been told by the last arrived Portuguese runaway; also, that if the fleet were ordered to make its voyage hither by a roundabout way, it might appear here very late in the season, as was the case last year with the Lord Commissioner Pieter Boreel, so that the said military officers, having now gone without their pay for two months past, and yet done their duties as before as becomes trusty officers, might have to wait a very long time if their reinstatement were put off until the appearance of the fleet\u2014by which especially those among them who are encumbered with wife and children might be reduced to sore straits.\n\nTherefore it has been resolved by majority of votes\u2014the more so, as in this way the officers aforesaid will be greatly encouraged, in future, not only as we have no doubt, to efface the former stain on their reputation, but also to be thoroughly revenged on the enemy\u2014that the officers aforesaid, Captain Paulus Doneq and the Ensigns Burchardt Cocqs, Jan Brandenburch, and Marcus Symonsz, shall be fully restored to their offices as they were before their suspension; their pay and rations being held to have begun again on the first day of this current month of November.\n\nAdriaen van Velsen, arrived in India in 1637 as a sailor, on a pay of 9 guilders monthly, at present serving as an assistant on a pay of 18 guilders per month, whose engagement is about to expire, is, by these presents, at his request, and\nconsidering his ability, admitted to a new three years' engagement as a first assistant on a pay of 30 guilders monthly, and moreover allowed the rations of an Undermerchant, the increase of pay being held to have begun on the first, and the new engagement on the 25th of this month.\n\nMS. fol. 99.\n\nBalthus Albertsz of Ruermond, arrived in India in 1640 in the frigate \"De Liefde\" as a ship's corporal, on a pay of 13 guilders monthly, having for about three years past served this garrison as a master armourer and sword-cutler with all due carefulness and diligence, never shirking any labour, without ever having got any increase of pay (as he had well deserved), therefore is by these presents, on this account and also because this garrison being daily expected to receive reinforcement, his labour will consequently also increase, at his request, and seeing that his engagement is expired, confirmed in the said office of master armourer, and by these presents allowed a pay of 30 guilders monthly, on condition that he shall be bound to serve the Honourable Company in India for another term of three years, the increase of pay and the new engagement being held to have begun on the 1st of this month.\n\nLaurens Selder of Karle in Kommeland, arrived in India in 1641 in the fluytschip \"De Dolphyn\" as a musketeer, on a monthly pay of 14 guilders, having at Batavia submitted to a reduction of 5 guilders, since at his request he was there taken ashore as a soldier, whose engagement is about to expire, is, by these presents, at his urgent request, admitted to a new three years' engagement as an Adelborst on a pay of 12 guilders monthly, the increase of pay being held to have begun on the 1st of this month, and the new term to begin on expiry of the old one.\n\nThus done and resolved in the town of Sta.

See mission of the Commissioner Boreel, referred to at pages 385 and 412 supra.\ndraw attention to the uncertainty of winds and currents, owing to which a good deal of time, nay the best part of the monsoon, would be wanted for getting here the fleet from Goa; also to the fact that the force in the said fleet consists principally of sailors,\n\nMS. fol. 106.\n\nso that the number of military persons in it cannot be estimated at more than 90, which reinforcement would be of little use;\nregard being had to the fact that in this way we should lose a great deal of time;\nthat it is highly necessary that the enemy's return fleet bound for Portugal should be prevented from leaving Goa; that the Portuguese have already got wind of our design through the Danes via Coromandel, and of the appearance of the present fleet on the Coast of Ceylon;\nalso that the enemy's forces from Columbo, being at present divided into two several troops, might perhaps be cut off from the said town and attacked with advantage;\nor that we might occupy Columbo by surprise and keep the Portuguese out of it;\n\nIt has been unanimously pronounced advisable that the fleet above-mentioned shall remain before Goa to prevent the sailing of the enemy's return fleet; that we shall only summon hither by the first opportunity the 90 soldiers above-mentioned, together with as many sailors as they can dispense with;\nthat we shall immediately summon hither from Galle in the ships 80 soldiers and about 200 lascorins, because we estimate the reinforcement wanted here at 300 Dutchmen, and because we want the lascorins to inform us about the situation of the interior as respects roads and morasses; to the intent that the enemy by these proceedings of ours may be the more misled and deceived.\nThus done and resolved in the ship \"Frederick Hendrick,\" 1 mile east of Sta.

Therefore, in conformity with previous resolutions, it has, after mature consideration of present circumstances, been resolved\n\nthat to-morrow, or the day after to-morrow at the latest, as soon as the guns shall have been planted on the points and everything be in readiness, and the coolies or black baggage-carriers shall have made their appearance here,\n\nwe shall break up from here with the whole army and march along the seashore straight to the river Moutewael aforesaid, situated at half a mile's distance north of Columbo, to the intent that when arrived there, we may with the Divine help drive out the enemy, who is rumoured to lie at vantage entrenched on the other side of the said river, and afterwards march against Columbo and with our troops make an attempt against the town, and if possible, capture it;\n\nMS. fol. 147.\n\nFor which purpose there shall also be carried by land the four field-pieces with their carriages, together with two barrels of grapeshot, two chests of wad, tampions, and cartridges for the same, under the command of the Constable-Major Christiaen Paulusz, assisted by 12 sailors and musketeers, the field-pieces to be dragged by coolies.\nThe following articles of ammunition and necessaries shall also be carried along with the same, to wit:\n\n300 lb. of gunpower \\{ for the soldiers, in case of\n5,000 lb. of musket-balls \\} necessity.\n\n114 bundles of matches in nineteen bags, the which shall be wrapped in tarred cloth, to keep them dry.\n\n50 long pikes \\{ to be used in wet weather instead\n50 long direlingen (?) \\} of firearms.\n\n20 shovels.\n30 spades.\n20 axes.\n10 pick-axes.\n30 cadjans to keep the powder and the matches from the rain.\n\nFurthermore, all the leathern buckets on board the respective ships of our fleet, in order to draw water out of the ditches on the way, which are said to be few in number and of little depth, to the end that the men may drink without troubling the water and in due order, for which purpose also each man shall have a cocoanut shell provided for him;

It has furthermore been resolved that by the yacht \"Santvoort\" 100 soldiers of the garrison of Galle shall be summoned hither, seeing that we have already sent thither upwards of 200 sick men, of whom we hope that the greater part may by this time be recovered.\n\nThus done and resolved on the north side of the river Moutewael, date as above.

Cruz de Gale, having taken on board from that quarter a rich cargo of about six tons of gold to strengthen the capitals in Persia, Surate, and Wingurla; It was objected to that the said yacht should set sail from here for its destination alone, regard being had to the fact that between here and Goa the enemy is oftentimes cruising along the Coast of India with a large number of stout frigates on all sides, by which (the which God forefend) the said yacht might easily meet with some disaster, as we may well see from the fate of the war-yacht \"Franicher\" (which God amend); Wherefore it has been unanimously resolved that the yacht \"Delfshaven\" shall accompany and convoy the said \"Waterhont\" as far as Goa, the said \"Delfshaven\" being duly victualled and manned with 50 sailors, the occasion being availed of to request the Lord Commander Claes Cornelisz Block before Goa to send us in the said \"Delfshaven\" fifty copper rice kettles and as much rice for the use of the garrison of Ceylon as she can conveniently take on board.\n\nItem, forasmuch as we learn from the said Lord Commander's two letters, dated from the 13th and 9th of this month, addressed to the Lord Governor-General, a copy of which has reached us by way of Coromandel,\n\nMS. fol. 160.\n\nthat the Lord President Wollcrant Geleynsz had come on two distinct occasions from Goa on board the ship of the Lord Commander aforesaid, but had not been heard of since, for\nwhich reason we are afraid that the said Lord President with all the friends in the ship \"De Pau\" are still in prison at Goa, therefore it has been deemed advisable to send to Goa fifty Portuguese prisoners, to be exchanged for our friends if they should still continue in the enemy's power; twenty-two of these prisoners having been carried to Malacca in the \"Cochin Fust\"\\(^1\\) and the English ship \"De Hoop,\" to wit, ten Jesuits, two Franciscan monks, and ten persons consisting of merchants, soldiers, and priests, and twenty-five common persons seized in the fortress of Negumbo.\n\nBut in case the Viceroy at Goa should have sent away from Wingurla and liberated the friends in the said ship \"Pau,\" and the Lord President Geleynsz, then the Commander shall by way of return set free all the Malacca priests and their prisoners, twenty-two in number, but the remaining twenty-eight shall be sent back hither to Negumbo and be carried again to Batavia, so that they be not again sent hither and we hereafter be again troubled with them; and in case all our men of the \"Pau\" should have been liberated, and only the said Lord President be kept in duress, then the Commander shall with a view to his liberation release five or six, nay if need be all the priests, but in no case any of the others, whether officers or soldiers, for we opine that so many\n\nMS. fol. 161.\n\necclesiastics must be sufficient for his liberation.\n\nWhereas, furthermore, as a parcel of English lead, cloves, rompen,\\(^2\\) refined brimstone, sandalwood, and opium has been taken in by our fleet, in order to be exchanged for fresh victuals for the use of our men, in case of our touching at the Coast of India or Malabar, or if we should not touch at the said coasts, to be sent to the Coast of Malabar for strengthening the pepper trade on the said coast,\n\n\\(^1\\) Literally, Cochin barrel.\n\n\\(^2\\) This was probably some shell or husk used as an article of commerce. Valentyn does not mention it in the list he furnishes.\nand since we have been informed that a greater quantity of merchandise has been sent there for the purpose of the said pepper trade than the pepper brought there would require, therefore it has been resolved that the said parcel shall be sent to Coromandel by the first opportunity, where the said articles are in great demand and find a ready sale.\n\nIt has further been resolved that all the tin on board the ships \"Amsterdam\" and \"Ackersloot\" shall be put on board the said yacht \"Waterhout,\" for which purpose are deputed the Merchant Gabriel Happert and the Fiscal Anthony Boey, who have received the said tin at Queda; in order to see to said transhipment, and the drawing up of the receipts required.\n\nThe quel \"De Hasewind,\" which the Lord Governor-General had destined for Persia and Surate, for the purpose of transhipping the merchandise, but which has hitherto been by us used for various purposes, is, by these presents, appointed to remain with the fleet provisionally, seeing that it is of great use to us in landing and embarking cannon, and we could hardly do without it owing to the inaccessibility of the Coasts of Ceylon, which\n\nMS. fol. 162.\n\nrender it highly dangerous to unload and embark heavy guns.\n\nThus done and resolved on the north side of the river Moutewael, date as above.

the said force to approach the town on two sides, enclose it, and gradually to reduce it by strength of men and cannon; for which purpose our present army is insufficient and the time too short; the more so as this fortress\\(^1\\) must be above all things fortified, and it is high time that this work should be taken in hand;\n\nTherefore, for all the reasons and motives aforesaid, the resolution taken on the 24th of this current month is, by these presents, declared null and void by the Council.\n\nIn accordance wherewith it has on the contrary, with the advice of the dessaves of his Majesty of Candia, been resolved, that this fortress of Negumbo shall be fortified in accordance with the plan and drawing made for this purpose, for which purpose our soldiers shall be used by turns divided into three gangs; on condition that each of them that work shall, over and above his ordinary pay and rations, get a remuneration of 6 stivers daily; the said\n\nMS. fol. 165.\n\ndessaves also promising to contribute 150 of their men towards this work, which shall now be taken in hand as quickly as possible.\n\nWhereas, furthermore, we have been informed by the said dessaves that seven frigates with reinforcements of soldiers for the use of Columbo, are arrived from Tutecorin and Nagepatnam, at Calpatin, 10 miles from here to the northward,\n\nit has been resolved that in order to keep off the said frigates the ship \"Den Engelsehoop\" shall sail from here for the bay of Columbo, having on board 30 soldiers over and above her usual ship's crew, and that in order to harass the said frigates off Calpatin aforesaid, the yachts \"Ackersloot\" and \"Wingurla,\" together with the fluyt \"Den Engeland,\" the large sloop having also on board in all a reinforcement\n\n\\(^1\\) Negombo.\nof a hundred soldiers, shall sail under command of the Lord President Jan Thysen, with Steven Pietersz, Skipper of the ship \"Amsterdam,\" as second commander; for which same purpose the dessaves aforesaid undertake to march thither with their men, in order, if possible, to attack the Portuguese by sea and land.\n\nWhereas, furthermore, it has been proved that the soldiers are with violence taking away from the natives fish, cocoanuts, and other necessaries which the blacks are in the habit of offering for sale in the market, without duly paying for the same,\n\nit has been resolved that as soon as possible a passer\\(^1\\) or public market shall be established, where the natives shall be free to offer for sale their provisions and refreshments of all kinds, and to sell rice and salt for ready money;\n\nthat all our soldiers and sailors shall be strictly forbidden to offer any violence, inconvenience, or harm to the natives afore-mentioned, but shall be bound to allow the said natives to sell their goods at the appointed place, free and unmolested;
