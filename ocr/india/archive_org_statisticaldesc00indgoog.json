Since its publication the position of the Gazetteer has been defined by a Resolution of the Government of these Provinces (No. 724A., dated April 21st, 1875), which runs as follows:\n\nREAD\u2014\n\n(1.) Resolution, Government, North-Western Provinces, No. 2799, dated 23rd June, 1868, laying down a scheme for District Memoirs.\n\n(2.) Report of Officer in charge of the Provincial Gazetteer, No. 1569, dated 29th June, 1874.\n\n(3.) Memorandum by Mr. Atkinson on the difference between the Gazetteer and the District Memoir.\n\n(4.) The first volume of the Gazetteer (Bundelkhand).\n\nOBSERVATIONS.\u2014The general design of the Gazetteer, as originally intended, can be gathered from the series of queries issued with the authority of this Government in 1871, and those subsequently circulated by the Government of India for the guidance of Editors of Gazetteers. In these Provinces, however, the common plan has been somewhat modified by the adoption of a scheme for the preparation of District Memoirs; and in consequence of this arrangement the Editor of the Gazetteer has not hitherto dwelt on certain classes of subjects which had it not been intended that they should have formed the main portion of the District Memoir, would have been treated more at length. The first volume of the Gazetteer is thus in some respects incomplete. The plan of a series of District Memoirs, originated by Mr. Thomason, and revived by Sir William Muir, is unquestionably good, but from various causes, and chiefly from the want of leisure on the part of officers competent to undertake the work, the District Memoir scheme has not succeeded. Memoirs have as yet been completed for only three out of the thirty-five districts in these Provinces, and His Honor sees no reason for believing that in future the progress will be greater. He is thus led to consider whether the restrictions as to form and character imposed on the Gazetteer should be maintained.\n\nIn view of the training and experience of the present Editor, the Lieutenant-Governor thinks it desirable that the Gazetteer should be more complete in itself, and that the gaps caused by the non-existence of the Memoirs should in future be supplied. The Editor should collect and exhibit all information on public affairs on the points noted in paragraphs 9 to 13 of his memorandum dated November 2nd, 1874, which it may be considered expedient to publish, and should include it in the Gazetteer, whether the information forms a portion of the plan of the District Memoir or not. The work will thus aim at a position differing from and somewhat higher than that of ordinary Gazetteers. It will be complete in itself, and contain an account of all matters of interest connected with each district, or, at least, where a detailed description is not considered necessary, a reference to them.\n\nWhilst signifying approval of the scheme sketched out in the memorandum drawn up by Mr. Atkinson, with the modifications necessary in view of the slow progress of the District Memoirs, His Honor desires his attention to the following instructions. The arrangement adopted in distributing the information in the Gazetteer is approved of, and should be adhered to for every district. As to settlement reports, rent-rate reports, and the like, as a rule it will be sufficient to give the results only of the settlement operations and a short sketch of the fiscal history, omitting details of a purely executive character, such as the reasons for adopting certain\nclassifications of soils in particular localities, the details of the survey demarcation of boundaries, preparation of records, distribution of judicial work, adjustment of circle rates and rent-rates, and other similar matters. At the same time, where possible, a description and history of each fiscal subdivision should be given, sufficient to place officers new to the district charge in possession of such general knowledge of the physical capabilities of the tract, its fiscal history and its inhabitants, as may enable them at once to exercise an intelligent control over its administration. The labour necessary to procure a correct balance-sheet of each fiscal subdivision, from the conquest or cession, would be very great; and as the information, when obtained, is more curious than useful, its compilation need not be attempted. Changes in the Judicial, Magisterial, and Revenue jurisdictions, lists of district officers, lists of villages and their assessment, the reproduction of settlement reports, and other similar matters involving much original research, and the preparation of large tabular statements cannot be attempted with the present establishment. Matters of Imperial policy will not be discussed, the Gazetteer being confined to the record of facts. It is difficult to lay down a hard and fast rule as to what shall be excluded, and in this matter great discretion must be allowed to the Editor, who will, as directed, submit the proofs before final printing for the approval of this Government.\n\nWith these remarks the Lieutenant-Governor leaves the work in Mr. Atkinson's hands, with the assurance that no avoidable delay will be allowed in its completion.\n\nThe system of transliteration followed is that laid down in the North-Western Provinces Gazette for October 3, 1874 (pages 1732-33), and for convenience of reference is reproduced here:\n\nRULES FOR TRANSLITERATION.\n\nEvery letter in the vernacular must be uniformly represented by a certain letter in the Roman character as follows:\n\n| Vowels |\n|--------|\n| **Persian** | **Devanagari** | **Roman** | **Pronunciation** |\n| Initial | Non-initial | Initial | Non-initial |\n| 1 | (zabar) | \u091c | not expressed. | a | As in woman. |\n| 1 | (zer) | \u0936 | | \u00e1 | father. |\n| 1 | or 2 | \u0930 | | i | bit. |\n| 1 | (pesh) | \u0932 | | \u00ed | machine. |\n| 1 | | \u0905 | | u | pull. |\n| 1 | or 2 | \u090f | | \u00fa | rude. |\n| 1 | or 2 | \u0910 | | e | grey. |\n| 1 | | \u0914 | | ai | aisle. |\n| 1 | | \u0913 | | o | hole. |\n| 1 | | \u0914 | | au | As ou in house (nearly, being a combination of the a and u above.) |\n## Consonants\n\n| Persian | Devanagari | Roman |\n|---------|------------|-------|\n| \u067e       | \u0628          | b     |\n| \u0686       | \u0686          | ch    |\n| \u062f       | \u062f          | d     |\n| \u0638 or \u0630   | \u0638 or \u0630      | dh    |\n| \u0641       | \u0641          | f     |\n| \u06af       | \u06af          | g     |\n| \u06af or \u063a  | \u06af or \u063a      | gh    |\n| \u062d       | \u062d          | j     |\n| \u06cc or \u0626   | \u06cc or \u0626      | jh    |\n| \u06a9       | \u06a9          | k     |\n| \u06a9 or \u062e   | \u06a9 or \u062e      | kh    |\n| \u0644       | \u0644          | l     |\n| \u0645       | \u0645          | m     |\n| \u0646       | \u0646, \u0627\u0646, \u0627\u0646, \u0627\u0646 | n     |\n| \u067e       | \u067e          | p     |\n| \u067e or \u067e   | \u067e or \u067e      | ph    |\n| \u0631       | \u0631          | r     |\n| \u0631 or \u0631   | \u0631 or \u0631      | rh    |\n| \u0633       | \u0633          | s     |\n| \u0634       | \u0634          | sh    |\n| \u062a       | \u062a          | t     |\n| \u062b       | \u062b          | th    |\n| \u0639       | \u0639          | w or v|\n| \u06cc       | \u06cc          | y     |\n| \u06cc or \u06cc   | \u06cc or \u06cc      | z     |\n| \u0698       | \u0698          | zh    |\n\nomitted, the accompanying vowel only being expressed.\n\ngy\nIn the present volume my acknowledgments are due to Mr. G. R. Williams, C.S., for notes on the Saharanpur District. For the Aligarh District I have depended almost entirely on the statistics given by Mr. Hutchinson for the pre-mutiny period, and on Mr. W. H. Smith's valuable reports for the period since the mutiny. Without Mr. Smith's assistance I should not have been able to give so complete an account of the Aligarh District as I have attempted. Mr. Smith, too, kindly examined the sheets relating to Aligarh whilst passing through the Press, and similar service has been rendered me for Saharanpur by Mr. E. G. Jenkinson, C.S. Throughout I have consulted with much advantage the valuable records of the Board of Revenue, the numerous settlement reports, and the records of the Government Secretariat. I cannot do better than quote here the remarks of the late Mr. G. Edmonstone whilst engaged on a similar work:\n\n\"It is, I believe, generally allowed that there are few undertakings more difficult of successful accomplishment than the detailed account of a tract of country, a description of its natural resources, of the improvements which art and civilization have introduced, and the further amelioration of which it is capable; of the extent and nature of its population, and, in short, of all the points which have any relation to agricultural prosperity. Although I have endeavoured to place such a picture before you, I cannot flatter myself that I have succeeded, and I shall only be too happy if my labours meet with the indulgent consideration which the zeal and perseverance with which they have been prosecuted deserve.\" If my progress has been slow, it has been due to no fault of mine, for the care and labour required in verifying and collecting even the statistics of the present volume have been such as to take up a great portion of my time. As it is, however, I trust that the labour has not been lost, and that the present volume will be found to contain an accurate and full account as far as my materials would allow, of the various subjects it professes to treat of. I have not ventured to recompile authorised statistics such as those relating to the census, settlements, the collection of the land-revenue, excise, stamps, and education, and give them as I find them on the authority of the departments concerned.\n\nNAINI TAL:\nThe 1st July, 1875.\n\nE. T. ATKINSON.\nSTATISTICAL AND DESCRIPTIVE ACCOUNT\nOF THE\nNORTH-WESTERN PROVINCES.\n\nMEERUT DIVISION.\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nCONTENTS:\n\n| Page | Page |\n|------|------|\n| Meerut Division | Communications |\n| General appearance | Population |\n| Rivers | Geology of the North-Western Provinces |\n| Canals | Fish of the North-Western Provinces |\n| Eastern Jumna Canal | General history |\n| Ganges Canal | Medical history |\n\nPART I.\n\nThe Meerut Division proper comprises the Districts of Dehra D\u00fcn, Saharanpur, Muzaffarnagar, Meerut, Bulandshahr, and Aligarh, but for the purposes of this notice the Dehra D\u00fcn District is omitted, as its description contes more correctly into the volume devoted to the hill districts. The Meerut Division, as thus restricted, occupies the upper portion of the Do\u00e1b between north latitude 27\u00b0-29\u00b0-0\" and 30\u00b0-21'-30\", and east longitude 77\u00b0-3'-45\" and 78\u00b0-42'-30\". It is bounded on the north by the Siw\u00e1l\u00edk (Shiw\u00e1lak) hills; on the south by the Muttra and Eta Districts of the Agra Division; on the east by the Ganges; and on the west by the Jumna. The area in 1872 comprised 10,110 square miles and 308 acres, occupied by 7,508 villages. The population during the same year numbered 4,860,228 souls, of whom 3,810,321 were Hind\u00fas, 1,045,780 were Musalm\u00e1ns, and 1,378 were Christians and others neither Hindu nor Musalm\u00e1n. The Hind\u00fas comprise about 78 per cent. of the total population, the provincial percentage being 86\u00b73 per cent. The Meerut Division has, next to Rohilkhand, a greater number and proportion of Muhammadan inhabitants than any other division in these provinces.\nThe Ganges and the Jumna, which include between them, the Du\u00e1b, issue from the Siw\u00e1lik hills in nearly the same latitude, and flow southwards in an almost parallel line. For a short distance after leaving the hills they traverse a formation of boulders superposed on shingle, which extends as the gradual denudation of the hills is effected. The boulder beds of the rivers sustain with impunity the great velocity which is a natural result of the considerable fall of the country close to the hills; but when the line of boulder formation is passed, some eight or ten miles below the foot of the hills, they enter on a sandy soil no longer able to withstand a rapid current. The consequence of this is, that the rivers hitherto flowing in channels of moderate width expand into broad valleys, which they have worn out for themselves in the friable soil that they here encounter. Within the limits of these valleys, the great rivers adopt an ever varying course, and within a few miles after leaving the boulder formation, the surface of the water in these rivers is found to be as much as sixty feet below the level of the country, and this difference in level is maintained until the united streams of the Ganges and the Jumna pass out of these provinces in their progress to the sea.\n\nThe alluvial lands which are formed in the wide valleys or troughs of the rivers are called the kh\u00e1dir of those rivers, and the high and dry plateau of the Du\u00e1b which lies between them is called the b\u00e1ngar or uplands. The declivity of the country rapidly decreases as the distance from the Him\u00e1layas becomes greater. Percolation on a vast scale is continually at work in the shingle and boulder portions of the courses of the rivers, and it is observed that the river Jumna in the latitude of Sah\u00e1r\u00e1npur is only fordable at favourable points, even when embankments are made quite across the river near Faizabad, just below the Siw\u00e1lik gorge, for the purpose of diverting the whole of the available supply of the river into the Eastern and Western Jumna Canals. The great central plateau or uplands touches the hills near the Sh\u00e1hjahanpur pass to the north of the Sah\u00e1r\u00e1npur District. From this point, a well-defined bank runs south-east to the high bank of the Ganges, which it joins near Bh\u00fakarheri in the Muzaffarnagar District, and this high bank thence throughout the Du\u00e1b forms the eastern boundary of the central plateau. The western boundary of the uplands runs close to the bed of the Jumna river. The lowlands or kh\u00e1dir here are much narrower than they are on the east, and seldom average more than four miles in width. The soil in these uplands, close to the hills, consists of a clay of a dark chocolate colour, producing fair crops in years of ordinary moisture. Further south loam and sand or sand alone predominates.\n\nThe central plateau is drained by the Hindan and its tributaries, which eventually flow into the Jumna, and the East K\u00e1l\u00ed N\u00e1di and its tributaries, which join the Ganges. The Hindan rises in the north of the Sah\u00e1r\u00e1npur District, and flowing southwards, receives on the left bank the West K\u00e1l\u00ed N\u00e1di at Rauli, in Parganah Burh\u00e1na of\nthe Muzaffarnagar District; and further south, on the right bank, the Karsuni or Krishni Nadi at Barnawa, in the Meerut District. Thence it bends to the west, and after a total course of 108 miles falls into the Jumna in Parganah Loni of the same district. Both the Karsuni and the West Kali Nadi take their rise in the Saharanpur District, and themselves receive the waters of numerous drainage lines. To the east of the Ganges Canal the head-waters of the East Kali Nadi collect in the Muzaffarnagar District, and, uniting further south, flow in a well-defined channel through the District of Bulandshahr, and join the Ganges near Kanauj in the Farrukhabad District. The Sengar rises in the Aligarh District, and flowing southwards joins the Jumna. Besides these main drainage lines of the central plateau there are numerous water-courses, which either join the larger streams, or make a way for themselves into the depressions occupied by the great rivers which form the main arterial lines of drainage. Such are the Katha, which rises in the Saharanpur District, between the Krishni and the Jumna, and after a course of 32 miles joins the latter river near Kairana, in the Muzaffarnagar District; the Sila Khala, an important drainage line of the Saharanpur District, joins the West Kali Nadi; the Nim and Chhoiya, lines of drainages which collect together in a defined channel in the Bulandshahr District, and join the East Kali Nadi south of Aligarh. The Karon, also rising in the same district, flows through Aligarh and Muttra, and joins the Jumna in the Agra District. These streams are described at length in the notices of the districts through which they flow.\n\nCANALS.\n\nThe most important feature in the Upper Doab is the great canal system which has its origin there, and sends out its fertilising streams in every direction. There are two main canals, the Eastern Jumna Canal, which waters the western portions of the Saharanpur, Muzaffarnagar, and Meerut Districts, and the Ganges Canal, of which the main branch, starting from Hardwar at the foot of the Siwaliks, terminates at Cawnpore in the Ganges, and a second branch runs, known as the Etawa branch, and joins the Jumna. The general history of these canals, as a whole, will be noticed here, reserving the local description and details for the district notices.\n\nThe failure from time to time of the periodical rains, and the arid nature of the climate of these provinces during some months of the year, has rendered the practice of artificial irrigation a necessity from the earliest ages, and each section of the country possesses its own primitive, and often ingenious, method for raising water for this purpose. In a small portion of Bundelkhand a few large reservoirs of water were formed by damming up the narrow outlets of the valleys. These works, after\n\n---\n\n1 The authorities for this portion of the work are the annual Irrigation Reports; the Ganges Canal, by Sir Proby T. Caulley; London, 1860; Notes on the Eastern Jumna Canal Levels; and the records of the Board of Revenue of these Provinces.\n\n2 Gazetteer, I., 147\nthe lapse of seven to nine centuries, still exist as monuments of the energy and skill of their constructors. Throughout the Tar\u00e1\u00ed, Bareilly, Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur, and Gorakhpur Districts, permanent dams were not attempted, but an indifferent substitute was found in the use of temporary dams thrown across the numerous small perennial streams which intersect those districts, whereby the drainage of the country was impeded and the malarious character of the climate of those districts was very much intensified. In the Du\u00e1b and the Benares Division irrigation was effected partly from natural reservoirs known as jhils, and formed in the shallow depressions which abound there, and partly from wells.\n\nAll these methods, however, were strictly local in their influence, and the sources on which they depended for their supply of water were generally limited, and liable to total failure in seasons of drought, just when their assistance was most urgently needed, and they have ever proved insufficient to guard the country against the inroads of famine. The absence of a strong central authority, and the parcelling out of the country amongst tribes and clans hostile to each other by religion, birth or tradition, have ever prevented any combined efforts of the people and the Government in carrying out extended schemes of irrigation. Here and there some local governor has made his name remembered by some attempts to provide water for the people of the town in which he resided; but, with the exception of the canals known as those of Ali Mard\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n, which have been utilised for portions of the course of the Eastern Jumna Canal, and the Ab\u00fa N\u00e1l\u00e9 line of drainage in the Meerut District, no remains have come down to us that have been designed to provide for more than the wants of a very limited local area. At present there are seven canal systems at work in these provinces: the great Ganges Canal, opened in 1851; the Eastern Jumna Canal, opened in 1830; the canals of Dehra D\u00fan, commenced in 1837; the Rohilkhand Canals, opened at various times since 1854; the small canals of the Bijnaur District; the Agra Canal, opened in 1874; and the Bundelkhand Irrigation Works of the Ham\u00edrpur and Jhansi Districts. The works in progress are the Lower Ganges Canal, intended to water the country between the East K\u00e1l\u00ed N\u00e1d\u00e9 and the Ganges, several projects of irrigation from small rivers in the north of the Bareilly District, and the Bundelkhand works, for utilising the waters of the Ken, Betwa, and Dhas\u00e1n.\n\nEach of these canals will be described in the volume to which the districts within which it is situated belong. In the present volume I take up the Eastern Jumna Canal and the Ganges Canal, each as a whole, reserving the district details for the district notices.\n\nThe original lines of the Eastern Jumna Canal were laid by the celebrated Canal of Ali Mard\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n in the reign of Shahjah\u00e1n. The excessive slope of the country between the Naugang and\n\n---\n\n1For a full description of each work on this canal see Capt'in P. T. Cautley's report: Calcutta, 1845; and Colonel Morton's Notes: Agra, 1852.\nMaskara rivers, which would have led to a retrogression of levels fatal to the direction which the former stream now holds, shows that at no time could this canal have contained much water, whilst the absence of distributary channels shows that it afforded little or no irrigation. It would appear that the difficulty caused by the torrents crossed in its course led to the project being abandoned. It is said that the water, at one time, travelled as far as Ranap, a royal hunting preserve on the left bank of the Jumna, nearly opposite Dehli; and the old hunting seat of B\u0101dshah Mah\u0101l, situated in the forests north of Nayashahr, was undoubtedly built either on an old branch of the Jumna, through which the canal stream was brought, or on an excavated channel made for the purposes of the canal. Z\u0101bita Kh\u0101n, too, succeeded in bringing a stream of water from the Jumna to Ghausgarh, one of his fortified posts in Parganah Th\u0101na Bhawan of the Muzaffarnagar District. Tradition has it that in doing so great loss was occasioned to the towns of Bahat and Sah\u0101ranpur.\n\nAnother canal project executed by the native Government was that known as the Ab\u016b N\u0101l\u0101, or canal of Muhammad Ab\u016b Kh\u0101n, the remains of which still exist in the vicinity of Meerut.\n\nIt consisted of a cut made from the West K\u0101l\u012b N\u0101d\u012b, near the village of R\u0101mpur, to the head of a small tributary of the East K\u0101l\u012b N\u0101d\u012b, called the Khodara N\u0101l\u0101, which rises near the village of Daur\u0101la. The length of this cut did not exceed 12\u00bd miles, and its width, judging from the present remains, could not have exceeded 15 feet. The water after reaching Daur\u0101la must have passed down the Khodara N\u0101l\u0101 to Meerut to irrigate the gardens and orchards around the town. There is no tradition of it as a running stream, though for a season it must have had a supply of water. The bed of the canal was formed by throwing an embankment across the head of the West K\u0101l\u012b N\u0101d\u012b, which checked the floods in the river, and must have given rise to extensive inundations. For these reasons, and the difficulties encountered in keeping the bed clear of silt, the project was abandoned.\n\nThe present Ganges Canal crosses the Ab\u016b N\u0101l\u0101 near Jaw\u0101l\u0101garh, and that portion of the n\u0101l\u0101 which approaches the canal from the West K\u0101l\u012b N\u0101d\u012b is now converted into an escape for throwing the waste water from the canal into the valley of the river. A similar work was executed by Ghul\u0101m K\u0101dir by means of an embankment thrown across the Karsuni or Krishn\u012b, which runs westward and parallel to West K\u0101l\u012b N\u0101d\u012b, close by the towns of Jal\u0101labad and Th\u0101na Bhawan. Captain Debude, in 1825, proposed to carry out the original design of Muhammad Ab\u016b\u2019s canal, but the project was found to be unsuited for the objects proposed.\n\nEASTERN JUMNA CANAL.\n\nDuring the short period of thirty-five years in the beginning of the present century no less than eight famines occurred; the evident failure of all the ordinary sources and methods\nof irrigation gave rise to the conviction that more extended schemes were required, and during this period the foundations were laid of the system of canals, by which in the course of a few years almost the entire area of the North-Western Provinces will be commanded. In 1809, on the 7th of October, the first step was taken by the British Government towards this object. The Board of Commissioners, actuated probably by the disastrous results of the famine of 1803-04, one of the severest on record in the annals of these provinces, recommended that a survey should be undertaken of the Du\u00e1b Canal line, now known as the Eastern Jumna Canal, and Lieutenant Todd, of the Bengal Army, was deputed to the work. Lieutenant Todd followed a line taken by Colonel Kyd in the early part of the same year, and appears to have completed his survey in the following year, 1810; but the passing interest in the subject had been replaced by State considerations of even more pressing urgency. Years passed by in inaction. The terrible famine in Agra, Cawnpore, and Bundelkhand in 1813-14 failed to induce any exertions beyond the deputation of Major Hodgson, who minutely examined the line between Saharanpur and the Jumna; and the great scarcity which prevailed in 1819 throughout the lower districts of the Du\u00e1b passed by, without any further steps towards the security of the harvests being carried out.\n\nThree years later the subject was again brought forward, and in 1822 Lieutenant Debude, of the Engineers, was appointed to survey and report upon the practicability of re-opening the Du\u00e1b Canal. In 1823, Captain R. Smith, of the same corps, was appointed Superintendent, and drew up a rough estimate of the cost of opening the whole line from a proposed new head near Faizabad to its re-union with the Jumna near Loni, amounting to Rs. 2,03,633. Excavation was commenced at the close of 1823. The line taken up by Ali Mard\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n, the original projector of the canal, passed centrically over the high land between the Hindan and its tributaries and the Jumna, and showed much skill in selecting a course most favourable to the purposes of irrigation. The head was most probably taken from Khara opposite Kalesar; the canal flowed thence through the B\u0101dah\u0101h Mah\u0101l by Arfpur to Fatehpur, and entering the bed of the Budhi Jumna above Tanda, followed this bed to Nayashahr. From this point there is a cut to the Raipur river, down the course of which the stream was carried for two miles. Thence it crossed south-east over the high land, passing the J\u00e1tow\u00e1la drainage line and Naugang river, beyond which, at the distance of half a mile, it terminated in a depression known as the Bahat Kh\u0101la. Along this the canal took its course to its junction with the Maskara, in which it ran for 4,000 feet to the village of Kalsiya. Here the excavation commenced again upon high land passing to the west of Saharanpur, and terminating at the head of the Shaml\u00ed N\u00e1la, immediately north of the village of Abba. It followed this\nn\u00e1la for twenty-four miles to Bhainsw\u00e1l, where the excavation took a southerly direction, passing west of Sh\u00e1mli, east of K\u00e1ndhla, and west of Baraut. After passing Baraut the line inclined south-east to Deola, and about twelve miles below the canal terminated in the S\u00edkr\u00e1ni N\u00e1l\u00e1, down which it was conducted to Ranap and the Jumna.\n\nCaptain Smith followed the same line, but made its head much further south, between Fatehpur and T\u00e1nda, known as the Faizabad head; and instead of allowing the S\u00edkr\u00e1ni to carry off all the water, turned it into an escape, making a short canal between Gokalpur and Sal\u00edmpur the main outlet. Cuts were also made to form an escape for the waters of the Maskara during time of flood. The year 1824-25 was one of famine in the Upper D\u00fash, and in the following year scarcity was general throughout these provinces. The works were in the meantime pushed on as rapidly as the limited means at the disposal of the engineers would allow, and the canal was opened in January, 1830. Captain P. T. Cautley was appointed to succeed Colonel Smith during the same year. In 1834 it was found necessary to utilise the old Khara head as well, and some slight alterations brought it into use as an alternative source of supply. Numerous works, rendered necessary by the actual experience of the water requirements of the districts through which the canal passed, were subsequently undertaken, and roads, bridges, and embankments were constructed. One feature of this canal, afterwards adopted on the Ganges Canal, was the formation of large plantations of sal, sis\u00fa, teak, and t\u00e9n. Numerous chaukis (or rest-houses for the establishment) were also built. But all these matters, though increasing the cost of construction, were found, on the whole, to result in a very moderate outlay, when compared with the advantages derived from the canal, both in insuring a crop in seasons of drought, as well as in inducing the people to bring under cultivation the lands hitherto lying waste for want of water.\n\nThe bed of the canal from the Jumna head to a point opposite Alampur, on the Raipur N\u00e1l\u00e1, is composed of shingle or stone boulders decreasing in size on the approach to Alampur. From Alampur to Sarkari it consists of sand, with beds of clay here and there, but the sand predominates. From Sarkari to Jauli, clay in some places mixes with the kunkur, and from there to the tail of the canal at Sal\u00edmpur the bed is sand. On the sandy sections of the canal erosion early set in, owing to the rapid fall in level, and rapids were formed which destroyed several bridges. These difficulties were got over by the construction of falls at Bolka, Randaul, and G\u00fana in the first place, where the injury was most felt, and subsequently at Nagla, Babail, Sukulpur, Jauli, Sal\u00edmpur, S\u00edkr\u00e1ni, Sarkari, Hal\u00e1lpur, Mekchhap\u00e1r, R\u00edri, and B\u00e1lpur. In 1852 Colonel Morton carried out the suggestions of Captain Cautley by constructing other falls and cuts, which materially improved the position of the canal.\nas a means of irrigation, not of inundation, as it had on several occasions come to be. He also abandoned the tortuous course of the canal along the Sh\u00e1ml\u00ed N\u00e1l\u00e1 between B\u00e1lpur and Bhainsw\u00e1l, giving a perfectly straight line between B\u00e1lpur and the outlet, and thus saved the cost of maintaining 7\u00b75 miles.\n\nThe circumstance of the canal lying at right angles to the line of drainage running across the Maskara, Naungang, and J\u00e1tow\u00e1l\u00e1 torrents from west to east, was taken advantage of to relieve the dam at Kalsiya, by leading the surplus waters of the Maskara into the Chaicha, N\u00e1g\u00e1deo and Dumaula, the three eastern heads of the Hindan. The result of this was to reduce the Maskara at its contact with the dam at Kalsiya to a moderate torrent. Similarly, the J\u00e1tow\u00e1l\u00e1 drainage was turned into the Naungang stream, which was frequently relieved by permitting it to flow down the canal channel to the Maskara itself. Navigation was a secondary object in the construction, and can now only take place between Sarnauli, in Parganah Loni, and the outlet. As will be seen hereafter, none of the canals are as yet of much value as navigation lines, whilst as irrigation channels they have been perfectly successful.\n\nAt the end of the year 1830, the canal was opened with a debit against its capital account of Rs. 4,37,996. The following tables show the financial results of the management of the Eastern Jumna Canal for a series of years. These figures differ considerably from the results shown in the annual reports, and represent the latest returns of the office of Controller of Accounts. In regard to the capital accounts both of the Eastern Jumna Canal and the Ganges Canal, the differences between the results now shown and those given in the annual accounts may be set down as due (1) to the addition now made of the balances of stock in 1861-62 and to its fluctuations since then; (2) to the addition of the other suspense balances in 1871-72; (3) to a share of the Controller's office establishment charges from 1863-64 to 1868-69, and (4) to petty adjustments, discrepancies arising from various causes having crept in formerly when the office of the Joint Secretary to Government in the Irrigation Department and the Controller were apart. In the revenue accounts of both canals, the last two sources of difference, and a transfer from the revenue to the capital account of the survey charges for remodelling the works, sufficiently explain the differences in charges; whilst the exhibition of receipts, instead of assessments, accounts for the differences under \"revenue.\" The charges for interest have been altered to suit the revised capital accounts, and altogether the figures now given must be taken as superseding all accounts hitherto published relating to both canals. Five per cent. has been charged on the capital outlay on canals up to 1870-71, and after that the charge is four and a half per cent. Ten per cent. of the outlay on establishments has been charged to the capital account, and the balance has been apportioned rateably\nover maintenance and revenue, and the expenditure on works not chargeable to either revenue or capital:\n\n### Capital Account\n\n| Year | Outlay During the Year | Outlay to End of the Year |\n|------|------------------------|---------------------------|\n|

Captain Debude's scheme, drawn up in 1827, for utilising the waters of the West Kali Nadi along the line of the Abu Nala, for the irrigation of the Meerut, Aligarh, and Bulandshahr Districts, was shown to be deficient in supply and certainty. The united streams of the Hindan and West Kali Nadi were found not to be able to give more than 180 days' supply during the dry months, and during the rains the works would be subject to excessive flood action. Colonel John Colvin, C.B., recommended an examination of the Ganges above and below Hardwar, and on his departure from India in 1836, a series of levels was taken. The Banganga is connected with the Ganges in the same manner that the Budhi Jumna is with the Jumna, and it was thought possible to utilise the Banganga for the headworks of the proposed canal in the same manner in which the Budhi Jumna had been used for the Eastern Jumna Canal. The levels showed that this plan was not feasible, owing to the sudden rise of the uplands on the west of the Solani river, which effectually prevented the taking of water from a place so low down as the proposed site at Badshahpur on the Banganga. Inquiries were still further urged in consequence of the sufferings of the inhabitants of the Lower Duab during the great famine year (1837-38), when, notwithstanding a loss by remission and otherwise of revenue to the amount of over one and a quarter millions sterling, the people perished in hundreds of thousands from starvation, the loss of cattle was equally great, the fields remained untilled, and a total stagnation of trade and manufactures ensued.\n\nEarly in December, 1839, Major P. T. Cautley proceeded to Hardwar and commenced a close examination of the khaddir or low-lands of the Ganges in its vicinity. He first attempted to connect the Banganga project with Debude's proposal for a dam on the west Kali Nadi at Raniapur, the head of the Abu Nala. He, however, found that from the surface of the water at Badshahpur, on the Banganga, to the surface of the water of the West Kali Nadi at Raniapur, a distance of forty miles, there was only a fall of 12 feet whilst the high lands on the banks of the latter river near Raniapur were thirty feet higher than the initial level at Badshahpur. For the first ten miles from Badshahpur to the edge of the upland cliff, the land for nine miles is tolerably level, but it then suddenly rises until it gains an elevation of 83-225 feet near the village of Kumbhera, from which place there is a slope towards Raniapur of about 2\u00bd feet in the mile. Thus a\nsecond and closer examination of the proposed site entirely removed this project from the list of those to be attempted. Major Cautley next examined the triangular patch of kh\u0101d\u012br lying between B\u016brki and Hardw\u0101r, and discovered two lines through which a canal might be taken. The first had a very extended circuit stretching far to the west, and much interrupted by forest and drainage lines; the second was more direct, but necessitated the construction of an aqueduct across the Sol\u0101n\u012b. He gave in an estimate for a canal on a minimum scale amounting to 26 lakhs of rupees and providing for 256 miles of main canal and 73 miles of branches, with the necessary appliances for converting the main canal into a navigable line.\n\nThe Board of Directors, in their despatch of the 1st September, 1841, warmly took up the subject, and wrote that, \"apart from the consideration of financial results, which we are far from contemplating with indifference, there are few measures connected with our revenue administration in India more calculated to contribute to the general improvement of the country, the amelioration of the condition of the people, and to raise the character of the Government, than those of the nature now under our consideration. We concur in opinion with the Government of Agra that a higher ground for advocating these works is found in the security which they afford against famine and its attendant horrors.\" On receipt of this sanction, a committee was appointed to report on the efficiency of the proposed works, the probable success of the undertaking, the scale on which it should in the first instance be carried on, and the precise measures to be recommended for adoption, the probable effects of the abstraction of the maximum supply of water on the navigation of the Ganges, the probable cost of the extension of the canal to Allahabad, and the probable return from the work. The committee recommended the adoption of the straight line with an aqueduct across the Sol\u0101n\u012b, and that 6,750 cubic feet per second should be drawn from the Ganges to provide for one main line of navigable canal from Hardw\u0101r to Cawnpore, and to supply irrigation to the whole district bounded by the Ganges on the one side and by the Hindan and the Jumna on the other. On the subject of returns, the committee calculated that irrigation would be provided for 2,303 square miles of 1,024 bighas each, which at ten annas a bigha would give Rs. 14,86,420, independently of mill-rents, navigation dues, and the sales of miscellaneous canal produce.\n\nThe works were commenced on the 16th April, 1842, by opening the excavation between Kankhal and Hardw\u0101r, but were stopped in the following July, owing to certain doubts entertained by the Supreme Government as to the propriety of proceeding with the works. These orders were subsequently withdrawn, and permission given to expend up to two lakhs of rupees per annum. The principal objection urged\nagainst the scheme was one based on a clerical error in placing the point of a decimal, by which the proportion of surface of the Du\u00e1b which would derive benefit from the canal was much exaggerated, but this was soon cleared up. The probable effect of earthquakes was brought to bear against the construction of the Sol\u00e1ni aqueduct. The injury to the navigation of the upper Ganges and the probable dissemination of malarious diseases were also urged against the canal.\n\n\"The works, however, had proceeded too far to be violently stopped, and under the restrictions pointed out above, they steadily proceeded with the cordial support of the Agra Government, but with little countenance from other quarters.\" Major Cautley was the leading spirit of the whole scheme, and under him Lieutenant Strechey, R.E., for some time assumed the executive direction of the northern division of the canal. Early in 1843-44 the levels of the Du\u00e1b were completed as far as Allahabad, and reported on in 1845.\n\nPrevious to undertaking this survey, the Supreme Government had decided upon a total modification of the original design, and had ordered that the canal \"should be in the first place a canal of navigation, and all the water not required for that purpose may be distributed for the purposes of irrigation.\" The main line was then directed upon Allahabad instead of Cawnpore, and Major Cautley placed, in connection with it, three projects before Government, with estimates of the cost of each appended to them. The first for a main line ending at Allahabad, with a slope of 24 and 12 inches per mile, falls and locks to overcome the superfluous slopes in the northern parts, and ascents and descents into the Jumna. Efficient means of irrigation on the main line were provided as far as the boundary of the Cawnpore and Fatehpur Districts, and, in addition, projects for a branch line of 160 miles to Fatehgarh; of 70 miles to Bulandshahr; of 172 miles to Et\u00e1wa; and of 43\u00bd miles to Cawnpore were submitted, at a cost of Rs. 1,02,36,644. The second scheme differed from the first by continuing the main line from Cawnpore to Allahabad by a system of reservoirs and locks to the Jumna, and extending the irrigation to the neighbourhood of the town of Cawnpore, the tail water to be discharged into a ravine of the P\u00e1ndu N\u00e1di. This was estimated to cost Rs. 97,03,558. By the third scheme, the navigable channel turned off at J\u00e1r to the south and joined the Jumna opposite its confluence with the Ken. The Cawnpore line was also designed to be navigable and locked into the Ganges, with a branch for irrigation towards the junction of that river and the P\u00e1ndu. This plan was estimated to cost Rs. 93,39,747.\n\nSeveral changes occurred at this time in the administration of these provinces; Mr. T. C. Robertson was succeeded by Mr. George Clark, who was followed by Mr. Thomason, and in the middle of 1844 Lord Ellenborough became Governor-\nGeneral. Major Cautley went on furlough to England and was succeeded by Major W. Baker, B.E., in 1845, who with his assistants were obliged to abandon their work to take part in the Sikh war. A committee appointed to report on the influence of the canal on navigation and climate presented the results of their investigations early in 1847 with such a favourable view of the scheme that Government directed the vigorous prosecution of the work. Again irrigation became the primary object of the canal, and it was directed, as far as possible, to lead the channel along the natural level of the country, following the watershed and interfering as little as possible with existing lines of drainage. The falls were to be made available as motive power for machinery, and arrangements were to be taken in hand for the formation of reservoirs and plantations as on the Jumna canals. It was determined, therefore, to push on the Solani aqueduct and other masonry works as a first measure, as without them the full supply could not be utilised. The whole line and its branches was mapped out into divisions, and the principal works commenced with vigour, whilst the detailed surveys were carried on during 1847-48. Lieutenant-Colonel Cautley returned and assumed charge of the canal in January, 1848.\n\nUp to this period the works had been proceeding on the third plan suggested by Colonel Cautley in 1845 and noted above. Difficulties were encountered in the character of the sub-stratum, which was found to be sandy and to underlie the clayey surface soil at depths varying only from three to ten feet. The alignment of the canal had, at this period, been devised so as to best economise the water and to deliver it over to the southern districts, where, from the difficulty of sinking wells and the lowness of the water levels, its benefits would be most appreciated. The main line was carried on according to the original estimate for 180 miles, throwing off from the left, at the 50th mile near Jauli, a branch intended to proceed to Fatehgarh, but stopping at Anupshahr, and on the right, at the 110th mile near Nidhauli, the Bulandshahr branch. Between the latter and the 180th mile a branch was thrown off to irrigate the country lying to the left of the Karon river and to the right of Kol, which is also at present unused. At the 180th mile a few miles below Kol, the main line divided into two channels, one on the left bearing directly on the Ganges at Cawnpore, and the other on the right, known as the Etawa branch, debouching into the Jumna near the boundary of the Fatehpur and Cawnpore Districts. The latter kept to the right of the Rind river, watering the Jumna parganahs. These modifications led, with a few exceptions, to the total re-projection, not only of the masonry works, but of the capacity of the canal channel itself. The cuttings were deepened, superfluous slopes were disposed of, and arrangements made for the supply of water to the new branches in the southern division. The cold-weather rains of 1850-51 seriously impeded the manufacture of bricks, but the delay then caused was made\nup in the two following years, which were marked by an uninterrupted and steady advance in the northern division, on a scale that could not be exceeded. The canal was opened on the 8th April, 1854.\n\nAt the time of opening the canal, the condition of the works was generally Condition of the canal as follows. Above the northern terminus of the Sol\u00e1ni aqueduct the canal was competent to receive and retain safely whatever supply might be admitted. Below the southern terminus to N\u00e1n\u00fa, a distance of 180 miles from the head, the channel was also good, as well as to Gihror, 57\u00bd miles from N\u00e1n\u00fa, on the Et\u00e1wa branch, and as far as the 81st mile on the Cawnpore terminal branch. Between the northern and southern termini of the Sol\u00e1ni aqueduct lay the works, which rendered the maintenance of a continuous supply impracticable. The masonry aqueduct and the left embankment were quite safe, but the right embankment of the earthen aqueduct was throughout incapable of retaining a full supply. The canal was accordingly closed again on the 12th April, and preparations were at once made for completing the earthwork. A light railway and boats were employed to carry the earth to the spot, but in August alarming signs of failure showed themselves in the masonry revetments of the right bank. At a point about 1,000 feet above the masonry aqueduct, the rear wall of the revetment bowed out to a maximum of 2-62 feet over a section of 300 feet. The result of this was that the arches bearing the steps of the revetment fell in, and on examination the cone of the embankment was found to consist of a semi-fluid mass. The engineers went to work vigorously, so that the canal was re-opened on the 6th November, 1854. At the same time the precaution was observed of admitting the water very slowly. At first only two feet of water was allowed to flow, but from January, 1855, the volume was increased, and by the 2nd of February the water reached Cawnpore. This second trial led to the discovery that the brick-on-edge floorings of several of the falls had been disturbed, and the masonry aqueduct on the Sol\u00e1ni was not water-tight, so that a second closing of the canal for one month was found necessary in March, 1855. It was again opened on the 1st of April, and in one week the water this time reached Cawnpore, and from the 1st May, 1855, irrigation commenced throughout the upper sections of the canal. The knowledge derived from the actual experience in the management of such a large body of water during the next ten years showed that there were several points in which the existing system of construction might be improved. Suggestions were frequently thrown out on isolated subjects, and these were gathered into a formal plan by Major Crofton, whose proposals became the subject of much minuting and correspondence.\n\nThe result of these discussions was, in 1866, the appointment of a committee by the Governor-General to decide upon the propriety of proceeding, as previously deter-\nmined, with Major Crofton's project for remodelling the canal, or of stopping its progress pending the preparation of a detailed project according to the views of Major-General Sir A. Cotton, with a comparison of the cost and advantages of the two plans. The committee was composed of Colonel E. Lawford, R.E., Lieutenant-Colonel J. C. Anderson, R.E., Lieutenant-Colonel J. G. Fife, R.E., George Sibley, C.E., and Hugh Leonard, C.E. The committee assembled at Cawnpore and examined the Jumna at Agra, the confluence with the Hindan at Ali, the canal works as far as the Dabauli falls, the Ganges at Rajgh\u00e1t, and from Garhmuktesar to the Sol\u00e1ni. The result of their deliberations was that the construction of a weir across the Ganges below its confluence with the Sol\u00e1ni was not recommended. The project for opening an additional canal head near Rajgh\u00e1t on the Ganges, for bringing under irrigation lands then not watered by the canal, was considered feasible, but was recommended to be kept in abeyance \"until the probable returns appear more proportionate to the outlay than at present.\" Major Crofton's plan for remodelling the canal was to be proceeded with, subject to certain modifications. The construction of a permanent weir across the Ganges at Hardw\u00e1r was judged absolutely necessary if it were intended to maintain a flow of 7,000 cubic feet per second without interruption. Sir A. Cotton contended that it would have been far better to open the canal heads below Shukart\u00e1r in the Muzaffarnagar District, and that even then, instead of expending large sums on the improvement of the existing line, it would be preferable to open a new head above Shukart\u00e1r. The committee found the valley of the Ganges there four miles wide, most of which comprised a low bed continually encroached upon by the river, and lying at such a depth below the high bank as to preclude the possibility of carrying the water on to the central tracts of the Du\u00e1b unless at a very great sacrifice. Garhmuktesar, too, had the same drawbacks. The great breadth of the river bed, the unfavourable nature of the banks, combined with the scarcity of good material, rendered it a most objectionable position for a canal head. The committee then recommended the neighbourhood of Rajgh\u00e1t, where the Mor\u00e1dabad and Aligarh line now crosses the Ganges, as the point from which the main line might be supplemented or a new line drawn. The remodelling project embraced the construction of additional falls and the removal of the evils caused by the excessive velocity of the current at the existing falls, besides rendering the main line capable of carrying 7,000 cubic feet of water per second. The headway under the bridges in many cases was found insufficient to admit of the passage of laden boats, and all these matters are now obtaining their full share of attention. The only accidents of late years were the injuries caused to the Jauli falls and Ranipur lock, both of which have been repaired. The remodelling project, with certain modifications, has been actively carried out since 1868 as opportunities\noccurred by the temporary closing of the canal. The whole of the falls of the canal have been made secure, with the exception of those at Januli, which is to be relieved of half the present pressure of head-water upon it by the construction of a second fall above the existing works. The history of the next ten years will show the effect of these improvements on the efficiency of the canal.\n\nA short sketch of the physical peculiarities of the country through which the canal flows is necessary to complete this notice.\n\nThe Kh\u00e1dir. The kh\u00e1dir or low-lying tract in the north-east of the Sah\u00e1runpur District is separated from the uplands by a ridge running in a south-easterly direction from the Shahjah\u00e1npur and Kunjn\u00e1war passes in the Siw\u00e1l\u00edka, to the Ganges at Shukart\u00e1r. The drainage to the west of this line falls into the Jumna by the West K\u00e1l\u00ed N\u00e1di, and that on the east falls into the Ganges. The towns of Bhagw\u00e1npur, R\u00farki, Jaursi, Landhaura, and N\u00fcrnagar are situated on this ridge, and overlook the deep depression of the kh\u00e1dir on the east. This kh\u00e1dir is bounded on the east by the Ganges, and is alternately flooded or drained by the Sol\u00e1ni, Pathari, and Ratmau rivers. The Ganges at Hardw\u00e1r is about a mile in breadth at its narrowest point, and divides into several channels separated by islands. One of these channels or branches leaves the main stream about 2\u00bd miles above Hardw\u00e1r, with a considerable volume of its own, and passes down close to the town, rejoining the present stream below Kankhal. It was from a place on this stream, known as Ganesh Gh\u00e1t, in the village of Mayapur, that the canal was drawn off, as it was found that this branch carried away more than one-third of the total volume of the river, and thus gave a supply amply sufficient for the whole canal. The heads were further strengthened by the construction of a spur dam and escape cuts. A great portion of the kh\u00e1dir tract here consists of the d\u00e9bris of the b\u00e1ngar or uplands, which has been swept down towards the Ganges by the mountain torrents which run through it. In addition to this slope to the east, this tract has a slope also parallel to the line of the Ganges itself. Taking advantage of this circumstance, Colonel Cautley so arranged his line that, after obtaining the levels he required, and disposing of the superfluous slope by the construction of masonry falls on the canal, he was enabled to enter the high bank in a moderate cutting. Thus the point at which the Sol\u00e1ni is crossed, though 80 feet below the head at Hardw\u00e1r, it is 70 feet above the surface water of the Ganges to the east. Between the Mayapur regulating bridge and R\u00farki, one of the first obstacles encountered was the R\u00e1nipur torrent system at a distance of about 5\u00bd miles from the regulator. The water of this drainage line spreads so over the whole face of the country as to leave hardly any trace of a defined channel. A dam was at first made, with an inlet and outlet on the system that had been followed in the upper works on the Eastern Jumna Canal, but the floods of 1849 showed that this plan was attended with such a deposit of silt\nas to completely interfere with the canal itself. A superpassage for the conveyance of the torrent over the canal was accordingly constructed with a waterway of 200 feet. The advantages of this method of crossing the drainage were soon apparent, resulting in the utter freedom from silt and the evils arising from the contact of two streams meeting each other at right angles, freedom from all wear and tear of channel necessary on the admission of the torrent into the canal bed, freedom from the anxiety of opening and shutting sluices, and regulating the escapes at the dams, freedom from all establishment for working the dams, and a consequent reduction of a large permanent establishment necessary for their maintenance. The passage of the R\u00e1n\u00edpur torrent over the canal is obtained by throwing arches over the lower levels of the falls, the waterway of which was divided into eight parallel descents of 25 feet in width, with a passage of 19 feet in width on the left for the navigable channel. All arrangements were made for securing the ingress and egress of the torrent from the superpassage. Between Mayapur and the R\u00e1n\u00edpur torrent the principal works are two bridges for cross-communication at Kankhal and Jaw\u00e1lapur, an outlet on the left bank at Kankhal, and three inlets on the right bank at Launda Laniw\u00e1la, Kankhal and Jaw\u00e1lapur, giving an inlet of 300 feet waterway and an escape of 20 feet.\n\nBetween the R\u00e1n\u00edpur superpassage, with its falls and locks, and the Ratmau torrent, the principal works are the falls No. 2, with a drop of nine feet; falls No. 3, with a similar drop; the Saltimpur inlet, with a 150 feet opening; the Pathari superpassage, with a waterway of 300 feet in width, connected with the Dhanauri falls No. 4, having a drop of nine feet into the bed of the canal; the B\u00e1sdsh\u00e1hpur inlet, with an opening of fifty feet; the Ratmau dam and inlet, with an escape of 800 feet and a bridge for the purpose of regulating the canal supply and of cutting off the canal stream from its passage onwards towards the Piran Kaliyar excavation and the Sol\u00e1ni aqueduct, together with a bridge for cross communication north of the works, and a line of navigable canal from the Jaw\u00e1lapur bridge to the tail of the Pathari superpassage. From the success attending the R\u00e1n\u00edpur superpassage, a similar plan was adopted with the Pathari. The Ratmau torrent, that was next met with, was, owing to its considerably lower level, somewhat more difficult to manage than the others. The valley here was a mile in width, bounded on the right by the steep bank of Piran Kaliyar, and having a slope from the point where its main branch left the hill to the intersection of the canal of 39\u00b718 feet per mile. The effective slope at the point of intersection was 8\u00b723 feet. The works constructed here consisted of a dam, of which the bed was flush with the river bed, and masonry sluices on the left for an escape, and an open branch through the right for admitting flood-water. From the Ratmau regulating bridge to the high land of the Du\u00e1b the canal runs in an uninter-\nrupted straight line, reaching the high land to the east of the town of R\u00fark\u00ed. Then by a curve to the left, which commences at the terminal point of the Sol\u00e1ni aqueduct, the channel proceeds in a straight line to the Asafnagar falls. The slope from the flooring of the Ratmau regulator to the R\u00fark\u00ed bridge was fixed in 1854 at 1:25 feet per mile, and from the latter place to the falls at 1:095 feet per mile. On leaving the Ratmau regulator, the canal channel passes for 5,000 feet through the low land of the Ratmau river. It then enters the Piran Kaliyar ridge. Through this ridge it has a course of 10,700 feet, with a mean depth of excavation of 31 feet and a maximum of 37 feet.\n\nAt a point opposite the village of Piran Kaliyar, a masonry bridge, with a waterway of 165 feet, has been constructed to connect the village with the temple tombs, and reservoir at the Darg\u00e1h on the opposite side. On the approach of the channel to the villages of Bajuhari and Mahewar the line crosses a hollow connected with a ravine which drains this portion of the ridge. An artificial cut made from the hollow on the right of the canal, diverted the drainage to the west of the Mahewar village. From this point the works of the Sol\u00e1ni aqueduct commence. The Mahewar hollow has, on both sides of the canal, channels of escape built in connection with the aqueduct and carried under the embankments. From these escapes, the downstream bank of which rests on the upper terminus, the canal passes the Sol\u00e1ni valley in a channel whose base is 150 feet in width, formed on a massive earthen embankment which was constructed from the excavation of the Piran Kaliyar ridge. The channel is revetted throughout its length with masonry disposed in the form of continuous steps resting on arches. The river itself is passed by a series of fifteen archways of fifty feet in width each. The level of the flooring of the aqueduct is 24 feet above the bed of the Sol\u00e1ni, and this may be considered the maximum difference of level between the bed of the canal and the surface profile of the valley on the whole length upon which the aqueduct passes. The great advantage derivable from the adoption of this plan is, that the canal was thus enabled to enter the b\u00e1ngar or uplands at R\u00fark\u00ed with a moderate cutting. The total length between the extremities of the termini is 15,687 feet, or 2 miles, 7 furlongs and 507 feet, of which 932 feet is masonry and the remainder earthwork. Cattle gh\u00e1ts and bridges were erected at either end. From the R\u00fark\u00ed terminus, the canal passes to Asafnagar by an abrupt curve protected by a masonry revetment on its right or concave side for 3,200 feet.\n\nBetween R\u00fark\u00ed and N\u00e1n\u00fa, a distance of 160 miles, the country through which the canal passes is marked by great declivity of surface, and by its connection with bh\u00far or tracts of sand-hills. After leaving R\u00fark\u00ed the canal turns to the left, and continues on a boring\n\n---\n\n1 Full details of the work on the Sol\u00e1ni will be found in Cautley's Ganges Canal, II, pp. 411\u2014537, from which this notice is taken.\nalmost due south for about 20 miles, until it reaches the neighbourhood of Belra. On this line it runs parallel to and between the high bank overlooking the kh\u0101dir and the S\u012bla Kh\u0101la, a shallow depression forming a tributary of the West K\u0101l\u012b N\u0101di. Throughout the whole of this tract the surface is marked by undulating ridges of sand, either skirting the edges of rivers or throwing out ramifications transversely. The line of canal crosses three of these ridges. Beyond Belra the canal makes a slight turn to the right, increasing the curve near Kh\u0101tauli, where it passes the heads of the East K\u0101l\u012b N\u0101di, which henceforth separates the canal from the Ganges. The distance between the East and West K\u0101l\u012b at this point is about eight miles, and through the centre of this tract the canal passes. From a point on the 50th mile a channel is given off to water the tract between the East K\u0101l\u012b and the Ganges, known as the An\u016bpshahr branch and having a length of 83 miles. The other works of importance are those at the 110th mile, where the Bulandshahr branch is thrown off, of which ten miles is regarded as a branch and the remainder as a distributary. The main line proceeds to N\u0101n\u016b, in the Aligarh District, where it divides into two branches, each 170 miles long; that on the right falls into the Jumna in the Et\u0101wa District, and that on the left into the Ganges at Cawnpore. The distance from Mayapur to N\u0101n\u016b is 181 miles; thus we have 614 miles of main canal, and 3,111 miles of minor distributary channels branching off from the main canal throughout its course, and which are more particularly noticed under each district.\n\nThe mode in which the accounts have been prepared is sufficiently explained under the notice of the Eastern Jumna Canal.

The mileage opened at the close of the year was 436.\n\nThe area irrigated during the year amounted to 98,000 canal bighas, or 54,734 acres, whilst about 166,000 acres in 1,134 villages were placed beyond the risk of serious damage by drought. The system of collecting the value of the r\u0101jbaha works from the villages through which they were constructed led apparently to such a check upon the demand for water, that on Colonel Baird Smith's representation the charge was postponed for some years. The canal was divided into five divisions: the northern, upper central, lower central, Cawnpore terminal, and Etawa terminal divisions, whilst the Navigation Department was placed under a superintendent resident at R\u016brki. In spite of all the disturbing influences of the year 1856-57, the area under irrigation trebled during 1858-59; the water-rate on the r\u0101b\u012b increased by 12 per cent., and on the kharif by 93 per cent. The following statement shows the total area (in acres) irrigated by the Ganges Canal from the year 1859-60 to the year 1863-64, the details of which are given under each district:\n\n| Year | Kharif. | Rab\u012b. | Total. | Year | Kharif. | Rab\u012b. | Total. |\n|------|---------|-------|--------|------|---------|-------|--------|\n| 1859-60 | 33,292 | 95,431 | 128,723 | 1862-63 | 90,693 | 114,912 | 205,605 |\n| 1860-61 | 69,361 | 275,449 | 342,910 | 1863-64 | 97,538 | 352,250 | 449,788 |\n| 1861-62 | 77,522 | 294,800 | 372,322 |\nThe length of main canal since 1859-60 is 519 miles. The length of the Fatehgarh and Bulandshahr branches from 1862-63 to 1867-68 was 127 miles; from that date to the end of 1871-72 they measured 135 miles, and in 1872-73 the returns show 96 miles. The irrigating capacity of the canal is equal to 1,205,000 acres. From 1855 to 1860 the canal was closed three times, for in all 27 days: from 1861 to 1865 there were ten closures, which lasted for 156 days; and from 1866 to 1870 the canal was without water for 160 days, distributed over seven closures.\n\n**Revenue Account, B.**\n\n| Year | NET REVENUE TO END OF YEAR | Charge for interest to the end of the year | Difference between the net revenue and charge

revised, a new item appears to the credit of the canal under the head of \"increased land-revenue,\" and it will be well to give here the departmental expla-\n\nEnhancement of land-revenue.\nnation of the term. \"When the settlement of a district is revised, and it is found that the land-revenue has been enhanced by the action of the canal, whether by increasing the irrigated area over that irrigated at the previous settlement, or by enabling waste land to be cultivated, the amount of the enhancement is credited to the canal, but only as a book transaction, and not by regular transfer. It will be understood that this indirect revenue can only be credited from the time at which the assessment under the new settlement comes in force, and it cannot be increased until the agreements under that settlement terminate, and another settlement is made. It follows that the rate of enhanced revenue will be very unequal in different districts. When the settlement of a district is completed before the canal system has become fully developed, the amount of enhancement due to the canals is very small compared with that obtained in a district over which the canal-irrigation has had time to spread; and what is of more importance than the mere paper credit to canals, the actual loss to Government in the postponement of the increased land-revenue till a future revision of settlement, is often very great in the former case. This is well exemplified by the cases of the portion of the Saharanpur District watered by the old established Eastern Jumna Canal, and the Bulandshahr District, where the settlement was completed just after the opening of the Bulandshahr Branch, when the canal-irrigated area was about one-fourth of its present average. In the former tract the rate of enhancement, calculated on the area irrigated in 1870-71 (taken as being an average year), was 15 annas per acre, in the latter only 4-3 annas.\"\n\nThe mode and nature of the assessments under this head vary with the peculiarities of each district, and will be found in the settlement reports; they are too technical and too incomplete for reproduction here. Up to the end of 1872-73 the assessments in six districts had been completed, those for Muzaffarnagar, Eta and Etawa were partially complete, and those for Agra and Cawnpore had not been commenced. The following table shows the amount of enhancement due to the action of the two great canals, as far as has been ascertained, to the end of 1872-73:\n\n| District          | Amount of enhancement | Remarks | District | Enhancement credited to Ganges Canal | Remarks |\n|-------------------|-----------------------|---------|----------|-------------------------------------|---------|\n|                   | Ganges Canal.         | Eastern Jumna Canal. | Total.   |                                    |         |\n| Rs.               | Rs.                   | Rs.     | Rs.      |                                    |         |\n| Saharanpur        | 15,268                | 64,106  | 79,369   | Complete.                           | Allgarh | Rs. 88,066 Complete. |\n| Muzaffarnagar     | 53,500                | 60,000  | 1,13,500 | Incomplete.                         | Farrukhabad | Rs. 10,410 Ditto. |\n| Meerut            | 79,458                | 45,781  | 1,25,239 | Complete.                           | Eta     | Rs. 12,439 Incomplete. |\n| Bulandshahr       | 33,418                | ...     | 33,418   | Ditto.                              | Etawa   | Rs. 27,751 Ditto. |\n|                   |                       |         |          |                                     | Mainpuri| Rs. 23,965 Complete. |\n\n1 Irrigation Report 1871-72, p. 23.\nThese figures would show a credit of Rs. 3,44,270 to the Ganges Canal and Rs. 1,69,867 to the Eastern Jumna Canal for the year 1872-73 under the head of \"increased land-revenue.\" The amounts actually credited in the Controller's accounts are Rs. 2,76,681 and Rs. 1,23,075 respectively. Some years must elapse before the credits under this head can be finally adjusted.\n\nDuring the year 1866-67 the whole available stream of the Ganges at Hardwar was turned into the canal from November until March, and but for the exertions of Major Forbes much difficulty would have been experienced in providing the supply required for irrigation. The average discharges during the same year were 4,391, 4,781 and 4,582 cubic feet, giving respectively returns per cubic foot per second of supply of 42\u00b735, 93\u00b786 and 138\u00b752 acres irrigated for water carried in the canal. When the mean volumes passing through the terminal escapes are deducted from the volumes of supply, the results are 47\u00b756, 115\u00b773, and 155\u00b719 acres per cubic foot per second of supply delivered into distribution channels. The same discharges applied to the water-rate give returns per cubic foot per second of Rs. 116\u00b768 for the kharif; and Rs. 186\u00b792 for the rabt of 1866-67, and Rs. 306\u00b786 for the year, taken on gross volumes, and Rs. 131\u00b70, 208\u00b79, and 343\u00b77 on the net volumes after deduction of the escape water. The canal ran for 308 days in 1866-67, being closed for 27 days in August for repairs.

Much attention was devoted during this and successive years to the calculation of the volumes of water passing certain points on the canal. The loss by absorption and gain by percolation are two disturbing elements in the estimate which no amount of accurate measurement at the points of entry and exit will eliminate. The information, therefore, given in a previous table must be considered as barely approximate. It is useful in showing, as far as can be ascertained, what duty is being obtained from canal water in each year, and any marked deviation ought to be capable of explanation.\n\nThe following table shows the mode of irrigation, whether by lift or flow, flow (tor) and lift (dad) for crops remaining all the year on the ground (annual), rain-crops (kharif), and spring crops (rabi):\n\n| Year | Crops | Year | Crops |\n|------|-------|------|-------|\n|      | Annual | Kharif | Rabi | Total | Annual | Kharif | Rabi | Total |\n| 1865-66. | Lift | 2-3 | 4-85 | 29-02 | 36-67 | Lift | 2-46 | 8-45 | 19-08 | 29-99 |\n|        | Flow | 7-4 | 15-76 | 40-17 | 63-35 | Flow | 6-21 | 26-66 | 37-11 | 70-01 |\n|        | Total | 10-2 | 20-61 | 69-19 | 100 | Total | 8-67 | 35-11 | 56-19 | 100 |\n| 1866-67. | Lift | 1-92 | 4-43 | 25-75 | 32-1 | Lift | 2-12 | 5-35 | 20-94 | 28-41 |\n|        | Flow | 6-38 | 17-57 | 44-95 | 67-9 | Flow | 7-70 | 19-62 | 44-27 | 71-59 |\n|        | Total | 7-30 | 22-00 | 70-70 | 100 | Total | 9-82 | 24-97 | 65-91 | 100 |\n| 1867-68. | Lift | 2-46 | 3-92 | 25-39 | 31-77 | Lift | 2-17 | 5-52 | 18-97 | 26-66 |\n|        | Flow | 7-90 | 20-43 | 39-90 | 68-23 | Flow | 8-07 | 22-60 | 42-67 | 72-34 |\n|        | Total | 10-36 | 24-35 | 65-29 | 100 | Total | 10-24 | 28-12 | 61-64 | 100 |\n| 1868-69. | Lift | 1-56 | 8-36 | 24-09 | 34-01 | Lift | 2-46 | 5-60 | 23-78 | 31-84 |\n|        | Flow | 4-07 | 17-93 | 45-93 | 65-99 | Flow | 7-52 | 20-50 | 40-14 | 68-16 |\n|        | Total | 5-63 | 26-29 | 68-08 | 100 | Total | 9-98 | 28-10 | 63-92 | 100 |\n\nAt the commencement, the falls were utilised as a motive power for mills for grinding corn. The Kankhal mills, with twenty sets of stones, and those at Asafnagar, Chhataura, Sal\u00e1-\nwar and Bhupa, with four sets each, were opened in 1855; and in the early part of 1856, Bahadurabad, with eight sets of stones, and the mills at Belra, Mahmudpur, Janli, Dasna, Palra, and Semra, each with four sets of stones, were put up for public competition. During the first two years the mills were worked under the direct management of the canal officers, as a temporary necessity, to exhibit their working capacities; but afterwards, as was usual on other canals, they were put up to auction to the highest bidder. In the early part of 1857 a rumour was circulated that the flour ground at these mills had been mixed with bone-dust by the orders of Government, and all work was at once stopped on them. The revenue in 1867-68 amounted to Rs. 26,908, or nearly two per cent. on the total income of the year, but even this is very small, when one considers that at the time the motive power available on the Ganges Canal was equal to the power of one million horses.\n\nIn the earlier years of the canal the transit dues were chiefly collected from boats working for the canal itself or the contractors employed on it. The principle on which the dues were finally established was that the whole private carrying trade of the canal should be placed in the hands of private individuals, under a system of licenses graduated according to tonnage. In addition to the actual dues brought forward to credit during 1855-56, the canal authorities claim Rs. 15,461 as savings to the cost of the works by the use of the canal for transit during that year. The development of navigation dates from November, 1856, when stations were established at Sardhana, Bulandshahr, Barauta, Dannahar, and Cawnpore. In the early part of 1857, a brisk trade was carried on, but towards the end of April navigation began to decline. At the breaking out of the mutiny there were 144 boats on the canal; the greater portion of these were either sunk by the rebels after plundering the goods they carried, or allowed to drift away. During 1857-58 navigation almost ceased, but in the following year it rapidly improved, and numbers of boats were built, both for the carriage of passengers and for merchandise. There are three serious impediments to canal navigation: the first is due to the great velocity of the current, which renders towing up-stream a serious work; the second is the silting up of the locks in places, and the third is the periodical closing of the canal for repairs, during which time both the boat and the boat's crew must remain idle. The navigation trade consists of either rafting timber or carrying merchandise in boats. The rafting is almost entirely confined to the upper portion of the canal, the timber being seldom carried farther down than the point nearest to Meerut, through occasionally it sometimes goes as far as Barauta, in the Aligarh District, and even Cawnpore. The direction of the grain traffic varies with the market rates. The metals and building materials are chiefly carried for the Rurki Workshop or other Government works. Cawnpore, Barauta, Nanu, Tatarpur, Rurki and Jawalapur are the principal\nlanding and shipping gh\u00e2ts. Mandakhera, Mur\u00e2dnagar, and Sikandra Rao are of less though growing importance.

In 1861-62 there were 616 boats on the canal, but these fell to one-half on the opening of the railway in 1863, and since then, though there have been some fluctuations, the numbers have never risen so high. The following table gives the revenue, less refunds, and the numbers of boats plying on the canal for a series of years:\n\n| Year | Revenue | No. of boats | Year | Revenue | No. of boats | Year | Revenue | No. of boats |\n|------|---------|--------------|------|---------|--------------|------|---------|--------------|\n| 1861-62 | 55,725 | 616          | 1865-66 | 30,949 | 266          | 1869-70 | 33,493 | 319          |\n| 1862-63 | 46,834 | 313          | 1866-67 | 38,119 | 597          | 1870-71 | 30,890 | 282          |\n| 1863-64 | 35,376 | 285          | 1867-68 | 33,218 | 450          | 1871-72 | 59,306 | 233          |\n| 1864-65 | 41,548 | 243          | 1868-69 | 38,784 | 487          | 1872-73 | 29,815 | 239          |\n\nThe returns under the head of \"miscellaneous\" consist of the sale of grass and fuel and the rent of small portions of canal lands, besides fines and similar items. At an early period canal plantations were made, which in a few years began to form an\nimportant feature in the miscellaneous revenue. In 1866-67 the income from this source amounted to Rs. 45,983 and the expenditure to Rs. 29,980. The number of trees alive at the close of the year (31st March) 1866-67 was 1,222,726, of which 785,294 were on the canal banks, 325,795 on r\u0101jbaha banks, and 111,637 in separate plantations; there were also 150,745 seedlings in nurseries. In 1868-69 large sales were effected in the Meerut Division to the Dehli railway and Meerut Division of the Public Works Department, whilst the felled timber was replaced by young saplings from the nurseries. The canal banks have an area of about 15,000 acres capable of being utilised for this purpose, and now bear nearly two and a half millions of trees and seedlings. The greatest number is found in the Meerut Division of the canal, and next to this come the Bulandshahr, Aligarh and northern portions of the first circle of superintendence. Strange to say, the luxuriant grass on the banks of the canal brings in nearly as large a revenue as the timber. The receipts from all sources during 1872-73 shows:\u2014From grass, Rs. 21,760; firewood and timber, Rs. 30,404; fruit, Rs. 3,708; plants, Rs. 106; and land rent, Rs. 3,312,\u2014or a total of Rs. 58,294.\n\nThe whole of the canal plantations have for some years been placed under the superintendence of an officer, called the Inspector of Canal Plantations, who reports yearly on their management. Systematic forestry is practised with much success, and the plantations are being gradually fenced in with agave and other similar plants, whilst increased attention is devoted to the production of trees of rapid growth producing timber useful for firewood and general purposes, such as siras, shisham, kilkar, siri, paphri, and the beef-wood tree. The seeds are usually sown in drills, or, where wanted, about five feet apart, and subsequently thinned out. Some efforts are, however, now being made to plant out the more valuable though slow-growing timbers, such as mahogany, teak, t\u016bn, b\u0101khi, &c. S\u0101l has been tried, but with little success, and it is proposed to confine operations in this direction to the left bank of the canal, leaving the right for the quick-growing acacias. Very much yet remains to be done, and activity in the direction of planting trees deserves every encouragement, even if the plantations supplied the wants of Government works alone. The great increase in the price of firewood and timber of every description presses heavily on the people, and leads them to cut down the groves around their villages, and thus in a measure assist in the denudation of the face of the country, which already has had a serious effect upon the rain-fall.\n\nFAMINES.\n\nA brief summary of the accounts that we possess regarding the famines and droughts that have visited these provinces will form a fitting pendant to the irrigation chapter, and an introduction to the local history of the famines to\nbe found in each district notice. It will also save much repetition hereafter.\n\nFamines.\n\nOne of the earliest famines of which we have any record is that noted by the pious Zia-ud-din Barani, which occurred in the reign of Firuz Shah Khilji. The dearth was due to the scarcity of rain, and grain rose to one jital per ser. In the Sewalik country the scarcity was very much felt.\n\n\"The Hindus of that country came into Delhi with their families, twenty or thirty of them together, and in the extremity of hunger drowned themselves in the Jumna. The Sultan and his nobles did all they could to help them. In the following year there was abundant rain.\" This calamity and a storm that occurred about the same time are attributed by the chronicler to the Sultan having caused the execution of one Sidi Maula, a religious fanatic, an event which occurred in 690 Hijri (1291-92 A.D.) The price of grain as fixed by Ala-ud-din Khilji about 1300 A.D. was wheat 72 jitals per maund; barley, 4; rice, 5; mosh, 5; moth, 3; and nukhud, 5 per maund. I cannot say what the weight of the ser and maund of either time expressed in our weights would be, but the purchasing power of the jital fell, if we calculate 20 sers to the maund, from four sers to one ser; or if the maund contained forty sers as at present, from eight sers to two sers.\n\nWe next have the long continued distress of Sultan Muhammad bin Tughlik's reign. He ascended the throne in 1325 A.D., and one of his first acts was to increase the revenue by from five to ten per cent. He invented oppressive abuds (cesses), which were collected so rigorously that the cultivators (raiyate) were reduced to beggary.\n\nThe rich turned rebels, the lands fell out of cultivation, and even the inhabitants of distant districts, hearing of the fate of the cultivators in the Duab, betook themselves to the jungle. A fatal famine took place in Delhi and the Duab. Grain became dear, and a scarcity of rain made the suffering general. \"It continued for some years, and thousands upon thousands of people perished of want. Communities were broken up and families were reduced to distress.\" The Emperor was then at Multan, and on his return to Delhi found the famine so severe that man ate man. \"The Sultan strove to restore cultivation and had wells dug, but the people could do nothing. No words issued from their mouths, and they continued inactive and negligent. This brought many to punishment.\" Shams-i-Siraj, writing some time after, says:\u2014\"In the reign of\n\n---\n\n1 The authorities are Girdlestone and Henrey's Reports, the Native Histories, Board's Records, and Colonel Baird Smith's report. 2 Dowson's Elliot, III. 146, 591. 3 Elliot, ibid., III., 238, 245, 619. 4 Ibid., 345. Ibn Batuta was an eye-witness of this famine. He says the maund of wheat rose to sixty dirhams and more. \"One day I went out of the city to meet the sair, and I saw three women who were cutting in pieces and eating the skin of a horse which had been dead some months. Skins were cooked and sold in the markets. When bullocks were slaughtered, crowds rushed forward to catch the blood and consumed it for their sustenance. Provisions were supplied to every one for half a year at the rate of one pound and a half, Mughribi weight, each.\"\nAl\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn the necessaries of life were abundant through excellent management; but, through the favour of God, grain continued cheap throughout the reign of Fir\u00faz Shah (1351 to 1388 A.D.), without any effort on his part.\" Wheat sold in Dehli at eight jitals per maund and gram and barley at half that price. A camp-follower would give his horse ten sars for one jital. \"If, occasionally, prices rose from bad seasons or from scarcity of rain, and reached one tanka per maund, it was only for a short time. The good fortune of the Sult\u00e1n prevailed, so that no dearth occurred. Such was the prosperity that, throughout the Du\u00e1b, from the hill of Sakr\u00fadih and Kharla to Kol, not one village remained waste, even in name, nor one span of land uncultivated. In the Du\u00e1b there were fifty-two pergunnahs flourishing, and a similar state of prosperity prevailed elsewhere. The like prosperity prevailed in every fief (fikra) and district (shik). Thus, in the District of S\u00e1m\u00e1na, there were four prosperous villages within one kos, and the inhabitants were happy and free from care.\"\n\nIn 1398-99, A.D. after the departure of T\u00edm\u00far, the neighbourhood of Dehli and all those territories over which his army had passed was visited by famine and pestilence. Many died of sickness and many perished with hunger, and for two months Dehli was desolate.\u00b9 In 1424 A.D., Yahya bin Ahmad\u00b2 relates that the royal army was in Katehir, and was about to cross the Ganges towards Kanauj, \"but there was a terrible famine in the cities of Hiudust\u00e1n, and consequently the army advanced no farther.\" In 1471, owing to the wars between the Lodi Sult\u00e1ns of Dehli and the Sult\u00e1ns of Jaunpur, the lower Du\u00e1b and Bundelkhand, which suffered most from the contending armies, were the scene of much suffering and want. In 1631 a famine\u00b3 arose from a similar cause in the Dakhin, where the armies of Shahjah\u00e1n were employed during the two previous years; but in this case scarcity of rain, added to the destruction caused by war, produced a state of things where money could not purchase bread, and \"disease followed famine, and death ravaged every corner of India.\" During the reign of Aurangzeb in 1661, famine,\u2074 caused by extraordinary drought, ravaged the environs of Dehli and the upper Du\u00e1b.\n\nThe year 1739 is marked by scarcity caused by the irruption of the Afgh\u00e1ns from K\u00e1b\u00fal, and here it may be said that a similar result followed all their subsequent invasions. The Sikh invasions, too, produced an artificial scarcity hardly less severe than that caused by a failure of the periodical rains. The famine of 1770 was chiefly confined to lower Bengal, though from a letter of the commandant of the Allahabad Fort it would appear that there was a considerable rise of prices in the lower Du\u00e1b. To a demand for a supply of grain for the famine districts below Patna\n\n\u00b9 Dowson's Elliot, IV, 36. \u00b2 Ibid, 61. \u00b3 Elphinstone, 507. \u2074 Ibid.\nhe replies:\u2014\"I am sorry it is not in my power to comply with your directions. The quantity I have been able to collect to the present time would be barely sufficient to support the garrison a month in case of necessity, and the prospects of getting more are very distant. Though the inhabitants are not in such distress here as in the provinces, yet grains of all sorts are immoderately dear.\"\n\nThe North-West, however, felt the full force of the next great famine, the chalisa (fortieth), so called from the Sanskrit year 1840 (1783-84 A.D.), in which it took place. For the two previous years the rains were unfavourable, and the third year opened with an entire absence of rain in Asadh and Sawan (June-July). The next month passed with clouds, but no rain. The fields remained untilled, and the full force of the calamity fell at once upon the tracts removed from artificial irrigation. Towards the end of September the rains began, and with such an equal and regular fall that it is said that grain which had lain in the ground and had not germinated for the previous two years, then came to the surface. Agra first gave signs of distress, and crowds emigrated towards Oudh. \"Death left its mark freely along the road.\" Such was the general apathy that the bodies were not removed from the spot where they lay, even in towns or villages. No relief was held out to the sick or dying. Every man's hand was against his neighbour, and the strong ruthlessly seized the portion of the weak, for the struggle to maintain life overcame all scruples.\"\n\nThe famine was severely felt in Benares, where Warren Hastings was himself an eye-witness of its effects. He writes:\u2014\"The distresses which were produced by the long-continued drought unavoidably tended to heighten the general discontent.\" From Buxar to the opposite boundary I have seen nothing but traces of complete devastation in every village.\" Mr. Rose, of Cawnpore, says that, comparatively with the duration of each, the devastations of the chalisa famine were not so dreadful as those of 1837-38. Colonel Baird Smith held a different opinion, and Mr. Keene quotes an old follower of the Goshain leader, Himmat Bahadur, as saying that wheat sold in 1783-84 for eight seers for the rupee; \"which, allowing for the subsequent fall in the value of money, is equivalent to a rate of three seers for our present rupee.\" This famine was undoubtedly very severely felt in the middle Doab as far as Meerut; in Etawa, Aligarh, and Bulandshahr many mounds are still shown which once formed the sites of villages devastated during the chalisa.\n\nTurning to the Board's records we find mention of a famine in 1803-04. This was most severely felt in the Doab, though at the same time it caused an extensive rise in prices from the Benares Division on the south to Rohilkhand on the north. This famine, like most others, was mainly due to a failure of the periodical rains, and partly to the disturbing influence of the political changes that then occurred. The rab' or\n\n---\n\n1 Girdlestone's report, 8. 2 Mogul Empire, 140.\nspring crops in the middle Du\u00e1b were injured by hail storms in the early part of 1803; the rains, too, were scanty in the beginning, and failed about the middle of August. Up to the middle of September the rain-crops had more or less failed, and there was considerable anxiety felt about the spring harvest of 1804-5. These fears were partially realised, for the cold-weather rains also failed. The Government lost by suspensions during this famine alone upwards of thirty lakhs of rupees, most of which Mr. Girdlestone thinks, with justice, must be due to the famine alone.\u00b9 The crops in the upper Du\u00e1b yielded an average outturn in 1805-6, but in the following year, the rains, though at first favourable, broke off on the 21st August, and the rain-crops proved generally light, and in many parts which had not the advantage of well water totally unproductive. Similar disasters from like causes took place in the years 1810 and 1812.\n\nIn 1813-14, however, a scarcity deserving the name of famine took place throughout the middle and lower Du\u00e1b and Bundelkhand. In Agra the rain crop of 1812 was bad, and the spring crop of 1813 was still more scanty. The rains of 1813, also, were late; and though large advances for the purchase of grain for seed were made, numbers of people deserted the district for other parts of the country. \"Many died from hunger, and others were glad to sell their women and children for a few rupees, and even for a single meal.\" Though the Board of Revenue had offered to remit as much of the revenue as was thought necessary, the Collector hoped that the rainy season might turn out more favourable than it did, and the result was heavy balances in 1814. In Cawnpore, also, the drought was severely felt, grain selling at prices that it had not reached in 1803-4. Aligarh and Etawah showed a considerable increase in the prices of necessaries, though whether this was due to the drought or to the export of the home stocks one can hardly say. It was in Bundelkhand, however, that the calamity was most felt. The western parganas of Hamirpur had, in addition to the drought, to bear the raids of the free-booters who at that time harassed the border districts; and though this tract of country for a short time had some rest, it had never entirely recovered from the years of suffering it had previously passed through. Remissions were granted here as elsewhere, and altogether, amongst the minor famines, that of 1813-14 must be regarded as a costly one. Bundelkhand suffered exceedingly in the scarcity of 1819, and though this time relieved from the attacks of professed bandits, it suffered equally at the hands of the revenue authorities. Mr. Waring's settlements and the drought combined, reduced the people to great distress, and compelled again a sacrifice of revenue, which some supervision and foresight might have rendered unnecessary.\n\nIn 1824-25 drought was severely felt over the upper Du\u00e1b, and in the following year both Rohilkhand and the middle Du\u00e1b as far as Agra felt its effects. It\n\n\u00b9 Report, 22.\nis the same story of inquiries, grants of advances to stave off the present distress, and total inability to grasp the real remedy of a catholic system of canals, which took many years and the sacrifice of hundreds of thousands in men and money to impress upon Government. 1833-34 repeated the scenes of previous years, and Bundelkhand again felt a real famine. Mr. Pidcock, writing of the British Districts says:\u2014\u201cThe season of 1241 fa\u0161l (1833-34) was one of unparalleled distress to the people of this district (Hamirpur) and of loss to Government. The miseries of famine, pestilence, and exile which denuded this district of nearly one-half its inhabitants are too well known to the world to need recapitulation here; but it is not equally well known that, in addition to all this, the avarice and corruption of the native officers of this district were employed in frustrating the charitable intentions of Government.\u201d By far the greater portion of the remissions were collected and embezzled by the native Sub-Collectors. The balances amounted to about sixty-six lakhs of rupees and the remissions to nearly two lakhs during this famine. Between this and the disastrous year 1837-38 nearly sixteen lakhs of revenue were remitted on account of bad seasons.\n\nThe year of famine best remembered, and of which we have authentic records, is the year 1837-38. As this is one of the important famines, the district details will be given at length in the district notices, and here it is merely necessary to present a general view of its influence on the province. In July, 1837, the premonitory signs of the approaching storm were shown from Saharanpur on the north to Behar in the south, and from Lucknow to Gwalior. Baniyas closed their shops, the peasantry took to plunder, the cattle starved and died, violence to person and property was rife, and there was a general move amongst the population, each one thinking any other place must be in better circumstances than his own. Notwithstanding every effort on the part of the local authorities, disorganisation increased and the land remained in a state of chaos. Wells dried up, grass perished, the very trees were despoiled of their leaves to feed the remnant of the cattle. Lord Auckland, then Governor-General, left Calcutta, and assumed charge of the Local Government from Sir Charles Metcalfe in the beginning of 1838, and sanctioned the employment of the starving poor on relief works. Still hundreds of thousands perished from pure starvation, the roads were strewed with the dead and dying, and pestilence followed in the wake of famine. Mr. Rose\u2019s account of Cawnpore will be found at some length under the notice of that district, and will serve to show what the general suffering must have been. Between the months of January and July, 1838, his relief works were attended by nearly a million of people; burglaries and thefts were double the number that were before recorded; the receipts from excise fell to nearly one-half; and the balances of the land-revenue amounted to more than the collections.\nBetween the years 1837 and 1839 Government remitted close upon forty-nine lakhs of rupees on account of this drought, and balances still remained amounting to nearly thirty lakhs, most of which was subsequently written off. The loss of life was estimated by Colonel Baird Smith at 800,000 souls by hunger and pestilence; the loss of cattle, equally great, crippled the resources of the survivors. Mr. Girdlestone estimates the direct remission of revenue at ninety lakhs of rupees, besides over five lakhs of rupees expended by Government in gratuitous relief, and two lakhs of rupees supplied by private benevolence. So great was the prostration that followed this calamity that more than twenty years elapsed before the revenue regained its former standard, and the loss thus entailed is calculated at 133 lakhs of rupees, or, if all be added together, over two millions sterling in these provinces alone.\n\nThe famine of 1860-61 comes next on the long list of famines caused by droughts in these provinces. From 1858 there had been nothing but a series of bad seasons and more or less failures of the crops until, in 1860-61, the crisis came. Up to the middle of July, 1860, no rain had fallen, the people were driven to the use of wild fruits and grass seeds for sustenance. Between the 15th and 20th of July rain fell, but held off again, and with the exception of the week from the 11th to the 14th of August, and a few days in September, no more fell. Relief works were opened all through the upper Do\u00e1b and Rohilkhand, subscriptions were collected, and, as usual, efforts were made to relieve the distressed. By the end of July, 1861, nearly ten millions of souls had received food at poor-houses at a cost of over 4\u00bd lakhs of rupees, giving a daily average of 63,245 persons fed, and a daily expenditure of Rs. 3,102. Large numbers died, and the loss of cattle also was severely felt. Sir A. Cotton estimated the deaths from starvation and pestilence at 200,000, and Colonel Baird Smith estimated the deaths of cattle in the poorer districts to amount to one-half of those in existence. The balances amounted to 13\u00bd lakhs of rupees, of which about two and a half lakhs were remitted, but to this must be added as dead loss the sums expended in the distribution of food, in the purchase of seed and cattle, and in relief works, swelling the minimum actual tangible loss to over 20\u00bd lakhs of rupees. It is unnecessary to give further details of this famine, as it will be carefully noticed under each district.\n\nThe last famine that I have to record is that of 1868-69, which was felt throughout Rohilkhand, the Do\u00e1b, and more especially in the Jhansi Division. The immediate cause of the scarcity was the failure of the rain crops of 1868. There was a heavy fall of rain in June, succeeded by a month of dry weather, and again in July another heavy fall, succeeded by a similar interval of dryness. The result was, that\nthe crops were destroyed where beyond the influence of artificial irrigation. The rabi (or spring) crops of 1869 suffered to a great extent both from drought and hail-storms, and hardly yielded two-thirds of an average season. Prices consequently rose, and much distress was felt all over the country. Relief measures were promptly organised, and the poor-house system of administering assistance to the weak and aged was adopted. Benefiting by the experience of previous years, the principles and details of the arrangements to be adopted were sketched out beforehand, and when it was found necessary to commence operations every one knew exactly what he had to do. The black districts were mapped out into convenient circles and placed under special superintendence. Works of permanent utility, such as roads and tanks, were commenced, to find employment for the able-bodied poor, and poor-houses afforded shelter to the aged and infirm. Women who, by the custom of the country, were not used to appear in public received yarn for weaving, or cotton to spin into yarn, and were thus made, in some measure, to contribute to their own support. Each large gang was further subdivided and separately huttet near the places where their services were required. Native medical officers were told off to inspect each circle and prevent, as far as possible, any loss of life by the outbreak of epidemics. The principles on which the relief operations were based commend themselves in that they have been found successful in actual practice, and give a test as to how far the pressure of a scarcity exists. Those found capable of labour were obliged to labour, and received wages in money somewhat below the average, but sufficient when exchanged for food to support life. Where poor-house relief was asked for, residence within its walls was enforced, and rations were distributed in cooked grain, whilst a light kind of work was demanded from each one that was pronounced fit for it. It is manifest that no able-bodied man would willingly work for famine wages unless real scarcity existed, nor would a residence in a poor-house be endured for the mere sake of escaping work elsewhere. The records, too, show that the numbers on the relief works and in the poor-houses increased with the pressure of the distress, rising with bad weather and high prices, and falling with the commencement of agricultural operations, that gave hopes of a favourable harvest.\n\nTo carry out the scheme of charitable relief, the public were called upon to subscribe, and a committee was formed in Allahabad to regulate the collection and the distribution of the funds. Rs. 2,30,295 passed through their hands, but, subsequently, Government took upon itself the whole care of the really helpless, and the functions of the committee ceased. Altogether over four and a half lakhs of rupees were expended in charitable relief, of which about two and a half lakhs were furnished by Government. Balances amounting to over thirteen lakhs accrued, and of this sum about two and a quarter lakhs were remitted\naltogether. Again, over eighteen lakhs were expended on works of public utility in connection with the relief of the able-bodied poor, and over ten lakhs in advances for the construction of wells and the purchase of seed-grain and cattle. The total cost in actual cash of this famine may be approximately shown thus:\n\n| Total expended on\u2014 | Rs.     | Government Share |\n|--------------------|---------|-----------------|\n| Labour relief      | 18,61,020 | 13,37,621       |\n| Charitable relief  | 4,50,381  | 2,48,946        |\n| Loss by remission  | 2,20,000  | 2,20,000        |\n| Agricultural advances | 10,16,202 | 10,16,202       |\n\n35,47,603 28,22,769\n\nAdd compensation to lessees of ferries and East Indian Railway for losses ... ... ... 3,50,086\n\nRs. ... 31,72,855\n\nThese figures do not show the loss caused by the check given to the progressive increase in the material prosperity of the districts attacked, or that caused by the abandonment of the claim to a share in the increased profits from the land which would otherwise have been made. These matters are mentioned in the district notices, where further details are given. One thing can be learned even from the very short sketch of the famine history that I have given, and that is, that a famine is an expensive luxury for an Indian Government to indulge in, quite independent of moral and humanitarian considerations; in fact, from the lowest standpoint, it is a thing to be, at all risks, avoided. Accordingly, whatever measures are found useful in preventing, or at least mitigating, the evil effects of a season of drought should be adopted: these are, briefly, the extension of the canal system; the more liberal grant of advances for the construction of wells and reservoirs in places where canal irrigation is at present impracticable; and the provision of efficient means of communication between every district that is likely to be attacked and the great grain dep\u00f4ts of these provinces. Of the inestimable advantages of the canals in mitigating the effects of a season of drought the history of the year 1868-69 is a proof. Double the acreage irrigated in 1861 then received water, whilst 1861 was itself more than four times ahead of 1837-38. At the same time, the chapter on sanitation will show that if in years of famine the canals have saved life, their evil effects on the drainage system have been so prejudicial to the public health that it may be fairly asked whether the account is not balanced.\nMETEOROLOGY.\n\nThe suggestion of taking meteorological observations of a systematic and connected kind seems to have been due to Mr. Edmonstone, when he was Lieutenant-Governor of these provinces. The plan of taking the observations was partly drawn up by Colonel (now Major-General) Cunningham, R.E., who was the Secretary to Government in the Public Works Department, and Captain (now Colonel) MacLagan, R.E., who was then Principal of the Thomason College in R\u00fark\u00ed. Mr. Edmonstone had proposed that these observations should be taken as early as April, 1859, but it was not until September, 1862, that observations began to be recorded, and towards the close of the same year their publication was commenced as a weekly supplement to the Government Gazette. The number of observatories at first established was six, and they were at the following places:\u2014Naini T\u00e1l, R\u00fark\u00ed, Agra, Beawar (in Rajput\u00e1na), Jhansi, and Benares. In 1865 the instruments at Beawar were transferred to Ajmer, and those at Naini T\u00e1l were, in 1870, sent to R\u00e1nikhet.\n\nAbout the beginning of 1865 Government called on the Principal of the Thomason College for a report on these observations, and as Dr. Murray Thomson was in charge of the observatory at R\u00fark\u00ed, the duty of drawing up this report devolved upon him. A first report was published in August, 1865, in which all the observations made in 1863 were brought together and abstracts of them tabulated. A second report followed in January, 1866; in this the observations of 1864 were treated, and those of 1865 were the subject of a third report published in April, 1866. In February, 1866, Dr. Thomson was appointed Reporter on Meteorology for the North-Western Provinces. This was the first appointment of the kind made, but it was followed immediately by the appointment of Assistant Surgeon Neill as Reporter for the Panj\u00e1b, and in 1867, Mr. H. T. Blanford was made Reporter for Bengal. These appointments were the result of suggestions made by the Asiatic Society of Bengal. In their proposal a more extensive scheme of meteorological observation was sketched out than has as yet been sanctioned. The scheme in its present form was approved of by the Government of India on the proposal of the Sanitary Commissioners of Bengal, to whom the subject had been referred for consideration and report.\n\nAfter Dr. Thomson's appointment as Reporter, he obtained authority from the Government of India to ask for copies of the registers kept in regimental hospitals and civil dispensaries, and in reply received registers containing the observations made from the beginning of 1866 from twelve stations, and afterwards five more stations sent registers from the beginning of June, 1866. There were, thus, twenty-three stations at which observations were\n\n---\n\n1 From notes by Dr. Murray Thomson.\nmade: twenty of these were in the North-Western Provinces and three in the Province of Oudh. Ultimately this number was reduced to fourteen, one of which is in Lucknow, and the other thirteen are in the North-Western Provinces. In all these stations there is a proper observatory shed for the reception and exposure of the instruments, and a staff consisting of a superintendent, who is in many cases the civil surgeon of the station, and a native observer. Both of these now draw pay, the superintendent having an allowance of Rs. 30 a month, and the observer Rs. 25, with an increase of Rs. 5 every year until a maximum of Rs. 40 a month is reached. This improved scale of pay came into operation in 1873.\n\nThe following are the observatory stations at present in existence in these provinces:\u2014Chakrata, Ranikhet, Dehra, Rurki, Meerut, Bareilly, Fatehgarh Agra, Allahabad, Gorakhpur, Benares, and Jhansi. The North-Western Provinces Government bears the expense of all these observatories except Dehra, which is maintained by the Great Trigonometrical Survey. The instruments kept at each observatory are at least a mercurial barometer, dry and wet bulb hygrometer, maximum and minimum thermometer for use in shade, maximum solar and terrestrial radiation minimum thermometers, and a rain-gauge. A few have, in addition to these, anemometers and other instruments. It is intended, however, that all should in time be equally well equipped.\n\nFrom each of these observatories a register is sent to the Reporter every month, and the register embraces the state of the pressure, humidity and temperature of the air, as ascertained by the reading of the barometer, hygrometer, and thermometer at 4 and 10 A.M. and 4 and 10 P.M. every day. The amount of cloud in the sky, direction of the wind, and general state of the weather are also noted at these periods. The self-registering thermometers, rain-gauge, and anemometer are read once a day. Mean air-pressure, temperatures, &c., are taken, as a rule, from the average of the four readings as described above, and are not the average of the maxima and minima only. It is the duty of the Reporter to prepare an abstract of these observations every month, and to accompany this abstract with notes on the course of the pressure, temperature, &c., of the air during the month, with comparisons as to previous years. These abstracts and notes are published in the Government Gazette generally in the last week of the month succeeding that to which the observations refer. An annual report is also prepared, in which much of the monthly reports are reproduced and published along with tables of comparative air-pressure and temperatures, and the weather and meteorological phenomena are fully discussed. But no report which embraces only a tract like the North-Western Provinces of India will ever illustrate fully the causes of such important matters as deficient or excessive rain-fall, for the periodical rains of India proceed from causes which operate over a much larger part of the earth's surface, and no\nadequate explanation will ever be given of these until places over the whole continent furnish their quota of observations, and those be discussed by one writer.\n\nAs the office of Reporter on Meteorology is but of recent origin, it possesses no records of meteorological occurrences in far back years. And since the office has been in existence there has been very little to record of a more than usually remarkable kind. The following are all that appear worth mention here:\u2014On the night of the 6th of June, 1867, a very severe dust-storm passed over Agra, which did some damage to trees and buildings. Besides this there has been several storms of minor magnitude, but none approached any way near to what might be called a cyclone. On the 28th of June of the same year a fall of muddy rain took place. It was noticed on the same day in R\u00fark\u00ed and in Naini T\u00e1l, and a short account of it was published in the report for 1867. The year 1868 was remarkable for the deficient rain-fall. It was not only in the North-Western Provinces that the rain was short of the average, but likewise over a great part of the Panj\u00e1b and Rajput\u00e1na. The details of the observations made will be found under the notices of the observing stations.\n\nCOMMUNICATIONS.\n\nThe East Indian Railway runs through the Aligarh, Bulandshahr, and Meerut Districts, and branches off from Gh\u00e1z\u00edabad to Dehli. From Gh\u00e1z\u00edabad the Sindh, Panj\u00e1b, and Dehli Railway runs through the remainder of the Meerut District northwards, and on through Muzaffarnagar and Sah\u00e1r\u00e1npur to the Panj\u00e1b. The Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway communicates with the Du\u00e1b lines at Aligarh. The water communication by the Ganges Canal and the navigable rivers, the Jumna and Ganges, is fairly complete. The principal trade-routes commencing on the north are the lines by the Mohand pass to Mussooree (Mans\u00fari), and by the Timli pass to Chakr\u00e1ta. By Hardw\u00e1r a line follows the left bank of the Ganges to the great shrines of Ked\u00e1rn\u00e1th and Badrin\u00e1th in British Garhw\u00e1l, and, by the N\u00edti and M\u00e1na passes, communicates with Tibet. On the east, arterial lines connect Bijnor with Sah\u00e1r\u00e1npur and Muzaffarnagar; Mor\u00e1dabad with Meerut, and by An\u00fapshahr with Bulandshahr; whilst Bareilly is in direct communication with Aligarh. Through the centre of the Du\u00e1b, the Grand Trunk Road runs through H\u00e1thras, Aligarh and Bulandshahr to Dehli. Main lines connect all the principal towns with each other and the lines on either side of the Du\u00e1b. To the west, Umballa (Amb\u00e1l\u00e1) is connected by Jag\u00e1d\u00edri with Sah\u00e1r\u00e1npur, and again by Karn\u00e1l and Sh\u00e1mli with Muzaffarnagar. P\u00e1nipat and Rohtak are each in direct communication with the Du\u00e1b, and further south, lines converge upon Dehli from all parts of the Du\u00e1b, and through Khair and Tappal upon Palwal. The means of communication are, therefore, nearly complete, and, with the exception of isolated portions of the Sah\u00e1r\u00e1npur, Buland-\nshahr, and Aligarh Districts bordering upon the low lands of the great rivers, are amply sufficient for all purposes of trade and the conveyance of grain in seasons of scarcity. In fact, there is, perhaps, no portion of British India better supplied with the means of communication than the five districts noticed in this volume. The existence of extensive kunkur beds renders the metalling of roads here an easier and far less expensive task than in other less favoured districts.\n\nPOPULATION.\n\nAmongst the 4,360,228 souls comprising the population of the five districts noticed in the present volume, it has been already stated that 3,840,321 are Hind\u00fas, 1,045,780 are Musalm\u00e1ns, and 1,378 are Christians. Some further brief remarks are necessary as an introduction to the local details given under the district notices. Commencing with the Hind\u00fas, I find that 442,787 persons are entered as Brahmins, and of these 281,009, or more than one-half, belong to the great Gaur subdivision, and next to them in numbers come the Saraswats and San\u00e1dhs. Though a numerous and powerful body, none of the Brahman clans possess much political influence. The Gaurs are equally numerous in the Bijnor, Mor\u00e1dabad, and Muttra Districts, but further south are replaced by the great Kanaujiya subdivision. Rajputs number 261,970 souls. In Sah\u00e1r\u00e1npur, the characteristic clans are the Pundirs, numbering 14,843 souls, and the spurious Chauh\u00e1n Rajp\u00fats. In the neighbouring district of Muzaffarnagar the same clans show the largest numbers, and next to them comes the Chhotiy\u00e1na clan. In Meerut the Chauh\u00e1ns number 17,207 souls, and next to them come the Tu\u00e1r, Gahlot and Bh\u00e1l clans, whilst in Bulandshahr the Badg\u00fajars (13,116), J\u00e1dons and Chauh\u00e1ns form the characteristic elements of the Rajp\u00fat population. Bais, Bh\u00e1l, Gahlot, Chandel, Bagola, Jaisw\u00e1r, and Jaroniya Th\u00e1kurs are also tolerably numerous in Bulandshahr. In Aligarh the J\u00e1dons predominate, numbering 36,423 souls, or nearly one-half the entire Rajp\u00fat population. Chauh\u00e1ns here, too, are numerous (15,408), and with Kir\u00e1rs, Pundirs, Badg\u00fajars, Gahlots, and Jangh\u00e1ras make up the majority of the remainder of the Rajp\u00fat population.\n\nBaniyas number 247,345 souls, of whom 145,579 belong to the Agarw\u00e1l division alone. The remainder are chiefly Sarangis or Jainas, Gindauriyas, Bishnois, Chausainis, D\u00e1sas, and B\u00e1rahsainis. They are a wealthy, money-getting class, and have during the British rule attained to positions as land-holders, which may at some time be the cause of grave political anxiety. The great mass of the population, entered in the census returns as \u201cother castes,\u201d number 2,858,219 souls. To these belong the Aheriyas, who number over 7,000 souls in Aligarh. The Ah\u00edrs, so numerous from Meerut southwards, number 64,507 souls. Then come the Banj\u00e1ras, chiefly to be found in Sah\u00e1r\u00e1npur, Muzaffarnagar, and Ali-\ngarh. The Barhais, or carpenters, number over 67,000 souls, and similarly numerous are the great castes following domestic service or trades, such as the Loh\u00e1rs or blacksmiths, (20,594); Dhob\u00eds or washermen (25,957); Darz\u00eds or tailors (13,729); Chhip\u00eds or cloth-printers (12,722); Hajj\u00e1ms or barbers (73328); M\u00e1lis or gardeners (58,504); and Son\u00e1rs (53,883). The characteristic class amongst the labouring population is the Cham\u00e1rs, who number 777,308 souls, or more than one-fifth of the entire Hindu population. Garariyas or shepherds form an important element in the same class, and number 84,060 souls. G\u00fajars, Tag\u00e1s, and J\u00e1t\u00e1s, described more at length under the Sah\u00e1r\u00fanpur, Muzaffarnagar, and Meerut Districts, respectively, form the characteristic elements amongst the cultivating village communities. The G\u00fajars number 188,251 souls, the Tag\u00e1s 76,979; and the J\u00e1t\u00e1s 370,361. Other important castes are the Jul\u00e1hs or weavers (29,932); K\u00e1chhis (22,060); Kah\u00e1rs (162,593); Kal\u00e1ls (20,379); Kayaths (18,907); Kh\u00e1krobs or sweepers (156,321); Khat\u00edks (46,156); Kol\u00eds (72,023); Kumh\u00e1rs (75,434); Lodhas (101,483); Orhs (26,360); and Sain\u00eds or S\u00e1n\u00eds in the three northern districts (51,995). The mendicant classes are fairly represented by the Bair\u00e1g\u00eds, who number over 13,000 souls; the Gosh\u00e1ins (15,289), many of whom have taken to agricultural pursuits; and the Jog\u00eds (39,976).\n\nThe Musalm\u00e1n population presents some difficulties in the way of classification.\n\nMusalm\u00e1ns.\n\nSo many converts from Hind\u00faism are entered under the head of Shaikhs that it may be considered, at least in the upper Du\u00e1b, as a generic term for all who profess Muhammadanism, and do not belong to the well-known classes of Mughal, Path\u00e1n, or Sayyid. The returns show 410,267 persons as Shaikhs, and to these may be added the 483,635 Musalm\u00e1ns entered without other specification than religion. Sayyids number 35,984 souls, or more than any other division except Rohilkhand, doubtless due to their presence so long and in such numbers in the B\u00e1rha tract of the Muzaffarnagar District. Mughals number 9,030 souls, chiefly in Meerut and Muzaffarnagar, and Path\u00e1ns give 71,686 persons, pretty evenly distributed over all the five districts. In no part of these provinces have the Musalm\u00e1n missionaries been so successful in making converts. There are few classes of Hind\u00fas, whether Brahman, Baniya, Rajp\u00fat, G\u00fajar, Taga, or other caste, that are not divided into a Hindu and Musalm\u00e1n branch. Much of this is, no doubt, due to the fact of the proximity of this portion of the Du\u00e1b to Dehli, and the attractions of the court. In Sah\u00e1r\u00fanpur alone the returns show 9,395 Musalm\u00e1n G\u00fajars, and over 12,000 Musalm\u00e1n Rajp\u00fats. In Bulandshahr the Musalm\u00e1n Badg\u00fajar and other Rajp\u00fats number 7,811 souls. In Sah\u00e1r\u00fanpur again Musalm\u00e1n Tag\u00e1s are numerous, and in Bulandshahr and Aligarh Musalm\u00e1n Mew\u00e1tis are found. It is under the unspecified and classes entered as Shaikhs that the majority of the Hindu converts are found, and, on the whole, they cannot be\nput down at less than from one-half to two-thirds of the entire Musalm\u00e1n population, a remarkable proof of the success of unscrupulous propagandism in India.\n\nThe population is distributed amongst 7,508 villages, containing 1,015,037 houses, or a number of houses to the square mile ranging from 88 in Sah\u00e1rannpur to 114 in Meerut, and inhabitants to each house ranging from 4\u00b74 in Muzaffarnagar to 5\u00b71 in Bulandshahr. About nine per cent. of the population occupy houses built by skilled labour; the remainder are satisfied with the ordinary mud-built huts. About forty per cent. of the entire population, or 2,019,011 souls, are engaged in occupations connected with agriculture, and keep under cultivation 6,830 square miles of land. The land-revenue amounts to Rs. 76,87,398, or with cesses Rs. 85,65,190; the former falling at the rate of about Re. 1-14-0 per cultivated acre. The cultivated area distributed amongst the male adult (above fifteen years of age) agriculturists would give an average holding of about six and a half acres to each person, for which he pays close upon Rs. 3-8-0 an acre, and has to support about three persons by his exertions. It is not to be argued from this that the peasantry of the upper Du\u00e1b are badly off; they are wealthy when compared with the southern districts and the Benares Division, but still they have, like all their brethren, to live from hand to mouth, and, with the exception of the industrious J\u00e2ts, G\u00e2ras, and Tagas, there are few that have or indeed are able to lay by anything for times of distress.\n\nGEOLOGY.\n\nThe geology of the North-Western Provinces is separable into three divisions, corresponding to three distinct geographical regions. Twenty-three of the thirty-five revenue districts are entirely on the Gangetic plains. On the north, three districts (Dehra D\u00fbn, Garhw\u00e2l, and Kumaon) belong altogether to the Him\u00e1layan region. Out of nine districts on the south, seven are in a very large proportion covered by the plains-deposits; three only being in whole or in great part within the rock-area of the Peninsula of Hindustan. It is at once apparent that these geographical divisions are also strictly geological; and it may be here stated that no identification or relation has as yet been made out between the rocks on the north and on the south of the plains.\n\nThe middle region naturally claims first attention. It is often spoken of as \"the alluvial plains of the Ganges,\" or such like expressions. In a general sense these terms are admissible; there is no doubt that the materials forming the plains were conveyed by the Ganges and its tributaries. But in this range of meaning the Siw\u00e2lik deposits might claim to be included, for it has been shown that they, too, were accumulated through the existing Him\u00e1layan drainage system. Confining the word alluvium to its strict geological meaning\u2014to ground subject to flooding from the very elements that now exist, the alluvial ground of the North-Western\n\n---\n\n1 By Professor H. B. Medlicott, Geological Surveyor.\nProvinces becomes very small. It is necessary to specify still further to bring out the distinction to be made in the area under notice; the word \"alluvium\" is scarcely understood unless as applied to fine deposits from tranquil inundation,\u2014and it applies to such indiscriminately; whereas the point to be indicated is, what ground is undergoing increase from any form of deposition, and on what ground abrasion is in permanent action, or in other words, where river action is formative and where it is destructive. A very large proportion of the plains-area is permanently undergoing denudation: the main rivers run through it in confined and fixed channels, the flood-waters being well below the general level of the country. Several considerable streams, as the Hindan, take their rise within this area, and though subject to local overflow, with deposition of alluvium, must on the whole carry away annually a large quantity of earth. The fixed channels of the great rivers are of very variable width, and are generally bounded by steep high banks. The deep course of the river oscillates within the larger channel; the whole of the latter being liable to inundation from the floods.\n\n\"Kh\u00e1dir Mat\u00edi\" is as near as possible the native equivalent for the English \"alluvial land.\" But though there is always a large total area of alluvial land in the kh\u00e1diros of the great rivers, it is possible that, on the whole, these kh\u00e1diros are undergoing denudation\u2014that the new alluvial land formed by the changes of the river may be progressing lower than the older patches removed by the same process. There are no data for settling the point: it can only be stated that the fall of the rivers through this province is greater than that at which silt-carrying rivers become on a large scale depositing rivers, that the current here seems able within the year to carry off all the silt it receives. Below Ghazipur, on the border of the provinces, the fall of the Ganges lessens, and the river becomes on a large scale formative, great tracts of country being subject to inundation from it. It has not yet been defined how much of the eastern districts come under this or that condition of fluviatile action. The whole of the Province of Oudh would come under one or other of them.\n\nIndependently of such tracts as come within the sub-deltaic region of the great rivers, there is a considerable stretch of country Recent deposits. where the drainage is formative. The minor streams from the outer skirt of the mountains do not run on into the plains in deep channels, but through the deposits of earlier times, and flow, at least for many miles, in broad shallow and ever-shifting beds formed of their own deposits. The load of shingle, gravel, sand, and earth washed into these torrents by the heavy rain-fall off the precipitous sides formed of the soft conglomerates, sandstones, and clays of the Siw\u00e1l\u00edk hills, is far more than the current can carry into the great rivers. Something of the same kind no doubt takes place in\nthese rivers also: the quantity of large shingle brought by them to the mouth of their gorges is certainly not carried much further; but for the rest, the clear water issuing for the greater part of the year from the gorges seems to carry off any excess deposited thereabouts in time of flood. The clear water becomes quite muddy soon after entering the khaddir. There is thus along the northern margin of the plains a broad belt of ground, the formation of which is strictly recent. The upper portion of it, having a steeper slope than the rest, is chiefly composed of shingle and gravel with a filling up of sand and earth. This is the forest-bearing zone known as the \"bh\u00e1dbar.\" Except in the rainy season the bh\u00e1bar is devoid of water, streams of considerable volume soon sinking into the porous ground, to reappear (at least in part) along the lower fringe of the coarse deposits. From the cause just mentioned, this outer zone, though having on the whole a considerable slope (greater than the general slope of the plains) is especially watery and swampy: it is well known as the Tar\u00e1i. In the Jumna-Ganges Du\u00e1b the formation process is especially active owing to the greater development here of the soft upper Siw\u00e1l\u00edk rocks, which are the most abundant sources of detritus. The Tar\u00e1i in this Du\u00e1b is scarcely a noticeable feature, owing probably to the good natural drainage; the watershed being here 400 feet above the Ganges at Hardw\u00e1r. Eastwards from the Ganges the Tar\u00e1i becomes more and more distinct; and in the same direction remnants of an ancient bh\u00e1bar deposit become frequent and of increasing elevation, till in the far east, at the base of the Sikhim Him\u00e1lays, they stand at 1,000 feet over the actual torrents. To the south of the plains some analogous cases of recent deposits may be found, but they are altogether insignificant, the large rivers there also running in channels which they do not overflow to any extent. The phenomena under notice have been only incidentally examined, so that the sketch here given is very incomplete and open to correction.\n\nIt having been shown that the great mass of the plains-deposits belong to a bygone phase of formation, it devolves upon the geologist to ascertain the age and nature of that same. Very little progress has as yet been made to that end, the systematic study of the question not having been taken up. Some have maintained that the deposits are marine or estuarine; others, as seems more likely, that they are purely fluviatile, by a process precisely like what is now going on in the Lower Provinces. No trace of marine organism has been discovered in them. But some bones of terrestrial mammalia were found in a hard bed of calcareous gravel in the bed of the Jumna near Et\u00e1wa, and which seem to belong to species or varieties now extinct, so that these deposits will probably take rank among the later tertiaries. From observations made in sinking wells along the line\nof railway, one of the engineers has stated the ground section in the Duab to be as follows, viz., loam 35 feet, blue silt 30 feet, strong clay 20 feet, resting on a water-bed of reddish sand, from which the water rises some 30 feet. The appearance of salts to a very deleterious extent in the water and as an efflorescence in many parts of the country has been an object of anxious enquiry, especially as it seems on the increase. The source of the mischief has not yet been determined: it may be altogether due to the great evaporation with insufficient surface drainage.\n\nThere is more variety for the geologist in the rocky regions north and south of the plains. In Kumaon and Garhwal the Himalayan region boundary of the province extends up to the great snowy range, the frontier of Tibet. West of the Ganges, the District of Dehra D\u00fcn (including Jaunsar) comprises only a small portion of the Lower Himalaya. There is much uniformity in the arrangement of the Himalayan rocks, of which one may make three great divisions. The youngest of these includes the tertiary epoch, ranging from the nummulitic age to the Miocene Siwaliks.\n\nSub-Himalayan series. It has been named the Sub-Himalayan series, as principally forming the lower ranges flanking the mountains. In it, again, three well-marked physical stages have been described. In point of elevation the order of sequence of these has been reversed, the oldest being highest, and the youngest lowest. This has not taken place by inversion nor yet (it has been argued) by upheaval in steps, through faulting. Appearances are best explained by the supposition that, during successive periods of elevation, an irregular scarped line of erosion was weathered out along the newly-raised strata (like the present cliffed face of the Siwalik hills), and that against this as a boundary the newer groups of deposits were accumulated, just as we see the bh\u00e9kar slopes of the present day. As would result from such a process, the oldest group has been most exposed and has suffered most from denudation; only remnants of it are left along the flanks of the higher hills. The typical area,\n\nLower group. in which all the sub-divisions of this group are seen, lies to the west of the Jumna; the hill stations of Kasauli, Dagshai, and Subathu are on these rocks. The lowest member of the series consists at its base of brown clays with limestone and fine sandstone, passing up into thick red clays and strong sandstones. The age of the lower portion is well characterised by abundant nummulitic fossils. Only a very small remnant of those beds has been noticed in the North-Western Provinces; it occurs on a gap of the ridges bounding the eastern D\u00fcn, close above Rikhi-kesh and just north of the village of Bhawan. The middle group of the series\n\nMiddle group. is largely developed in the hills immediately at the base of the mountain range, as spurs of which they might be hastily described; but their distinctness as a range is well marked by a line\nof low gaps and of open longitudinal valleys along the geological boundary, the drainage passing through the range by narrow gorges. These features may be well seen under Mussooree. From R\u00e1jpur to the Ganges this flanking range has been removed, but east of the Ganges it appears again in great force, continuing so up to the Nep\u00e1l frontier. The strata are well exposed along both roads up to Naini T\u00e1l. They consist principally of very massive grey sandstone (very like the molasse of Switzerland), with subordinate bands of clay. The small nests of lignite found at many places in the sandstone have more than once given rise to exaggerated hopes, and even to confident statements, as to the existence of coal. The fine hematite iron ore of Dehchauri, near K\u00e1lidhungi, is only a local concentration of the iron oxide which occurs so finely disseminated as an ingredient of the clays. This middle member of the series has been called the N\u00e1han group, from the chief town of Sirmor.\n\nThe youngest member of the sub-Him\u00e1layan series is the Siw\u00e1l\u00edk group, so called from the name given to the outermost range of hills by the authors of the well-known Fauna Siva-lensis. These hills are much lower than those of the middle group, from which they are generally separated by the broad longitudinal valleys known as \"d\u00e9ns.\" These are structural features, not mere valleys of denudation; the form of disturbance of the strata is very regular, broad \"normal\" anticlinal flexures, the axis-plane sloping towards the mountains: the hills have been weathered out along the axis of the flexure, and the d\u00e9ns lie on the flat northern slope. The original Siw\u00e1l\u00edk hills are that well-defined portion of the range between the Ganges and the Jumna, separating Dehra D\u00fan from the plains. From a short distance east of the Ganges the range is broken and scarcely recognizable, having probably been denuded off and covered up, if indeed it had ever been so prominent as to the west: the bh\u00e1bar deposits often reach up to the base of the minor range. The P\u00e1ti D\u00fan is an irregular valley of denudation in these hills of the N\u00e1han group. The lower part of the Siw\u00e1l\u00edk group is very like the N\u00e1han group in composition, save that the sandstone is softer and fresher. At the top there is great thickness of conglomerate, both earthy and sandy. The physical separation between the Siw\u00e1l\u00edk and the N\u00e1han groups has recently been clearly made out; but the distinction was, unfortunately, not observed in the collection or the description of the great series of fossils formerly procured from this region. The vast majority, if not all, of the large mammalian remains were obtained from the younger group: some vertebrate fossils were found in the N\u00e1han rocks, but were confounded with the rest. A very interesting point\u2014the comparison of the two faunas\u2014was thus lost.\n\nThe second great rock system to be noticed consists of an unknown thickness of slates, limestones, and sandstones forming the first range of the mountains from end to end.\nThe stations of Chakr\u0101ta, Mussooree, and Naini T\u0101l are on this range. The strata are greatly contorted, although preserving a strike approximately parallel to the mountain range; and the order of the several bands of rock has only been vaguely suggested. The only fossils certainly known to have been procured from them were some casts of indeterminate bivalves from a band of limestone in the gorge of the T\u0101l river, at the east end of the Dehra D\u016bn. The lead mines of Sirmor and Sub\u0101thu are in these rocks. Trappian intrusions occur in many places.\n\nThe remaining rock system is that of the metamorphic and crystalline rocks with intrusive granite, forming the greater part of the broad zone of the outer or lower Him\u0101laya, up to the snowy range. The junction of these rocks with the slate series is well marked in the valley north of Naini T\u0101l. There is a large mass of intrusive granite near Almora. Copper ores occur at many places and are worked by the natives. They have not been favourably reported on by European mineral-viewers. There are many fine bands of rich iron ore, but the inaccessibility of the ground prevents their being extensively used. Impure graphite is found in several places.\n\nThe boundaries of the plains on the south are on the whole irregular although the arrangement and relations of the rocks are very simple. There are here but two rock systems deserving more than mere mention, the great Vindhyan series and a crystalline series. The Vindhyans represent a whole epoch in the geology of Hindustan, and are divided into an upper and lower series, each having several groups. Both of these series are fairly represented in the Mirzapur District. The plateau between the Ganges and the S\u00f3n is formed of upper Vindhyan rocks, principally of the Kaim\u016br group; and in the S\u00f3n valley the lower Vindhyans are well seen. From the eastern edge of the provinces, in Mirzapur, the upper Vindhyans are continuous right away to Agra, but in great part through Native States; the northern scarp forming approximately the boundary of the North-Western Provinces throughout the Districts of Allahabad, B\u0101nda, Lalitpur, and Jhansi. There is a break here, Sindia\u2019s territories running up to the Jamna, but further to the north-west, a ridge of Vindhyan sandstone, of the Bhaurer group, on which stands the famous ruins of Fatehpur Sikri, runs to within a few miles of Agra city. The upper Vindhyans consist of strong bands of sandstone alternating with strong bands of shales, in some of which limestone occurs. Along the boundary in B\u0101nda, Lalitpur, and Jhansi, the bottom beds rest undisturbed upon the crystalline, having for the most part completely overlapped the lower Vindhyans, of which only a narrow and broken strip is exposed between Kirair and the Dhas\u0101n. The lower Vindhyans are made up of limestones, sandstones and shales, a characteristic variety of which has porcellanic and trappoid aspects.\nThroughout their immense area in this part of India the Vindhyan strata are quite undisturbed, except along the south margin, as in the S\u00f3n valley, and again along the north-west boundary, as in the ridge of Fatehpur Sikri. The direction of disturbances in this latter position is parallel to that of the Aravali system, of which it is probably only a secondary and reflex effect. The Vindhyan rocks have given great disappointment to geologists in not having as yet yielded any fossil remains. It is only known through their stratigraphical relations to the Indian coal-bearing rocks that they can be at latest of middle palaeoic age. The sandstones of the Vindhyans afford everywhere admirable building stones.\n\nThe crystalline rocks only appear to any extent in lower Bundelkhand, in the wide bay formed by the Vindhyan scarps; principally in the Districts of Lalitpur and Jhansi, occupying the head of the bay, and to a less extent in Jalnaun, Hamirpur, and Banda, where the outcrops through the plains-deposits become less and less frequent. The rock is chiefly gneiss, often granitoid. The strike of the foliation and bedding, when observable, is generally east and west. Greenstone dykes are of frequent occurrence, with a prevailing north-west to south-east direction. But the most remarkable feature of this area is the number of great quartz-reefs. They have a prevailing north-easterly run, but exceptions are frequent. They stand up in abrupt wall-like ridges, sometimes over 300 feet high, many yards wide, and running perfectly straight for several miles continuously or appearing again on the same strike. They seem to be of earlier date than all the trap-dykes, and are often highly impregnated with steatite, and otherwise displaying metamorphic characters. It might be thought that gold should be found in or about these great quartz-reefs, but there is no trace or tradition of its occurrence.\n\nThe other rocks, of which more mention may be made, occupy a few square miles in British Singrauli, the southern division of Singrauli. In the Mirzapur District. On the entrance south there is gneiss, part of the great gneiss area of Behar and Bengal. Between this and the lower Vindhyans there is a band of sub-metamorphic rocks, principally clay-slates. South of this band, and resting on the gneiss, there is a small patch of this coal-bearing rock, the eastern extremity of the south Riw\u00e1 basin. From the Kota mine in Singrauli was derived all the coal that for many years used to be taken on pack-bullocks across the Vindhyan plateau to Mirzapur.\n\nFISH.\n\nAttention was directed to the fisheries of India in 1867, and Dr. Day was appointed to report on the fish of these provinces as well as the rest of India. His report was published\nin 1873. He divides the fish into those of the hills and those of the plains. Amongst the more important of the plains species is the mahaser (or carp), which lives in the rivers of the plains during the cold months, when the hill-streams are too small and too cold to afford proper sustenance. During the rains the mahaser migrates to the hills, and ascending some distance up the colder waters of the larger rivers, turns aside for breeding purposes into their warm side-streams. These side-streams, unreplenished by snow-water, are the natural breeding-places of most of the more valuable fish of the carp family residing near such places, and anything that interferes with them whilst there, must materially injure the fisheries. A large majority of the young fish remain in the hill-streams until the next rains. The local non-migratory fishes pass up small water-courses and channels, depositing their eggs in irrigated fields, flooded plains, temporarily formed tanks, on the grassy sides of rivers and lakes.\n\nMuch destruction is caused by the canals through which large quantities of fish find their way from the hills, but having once entered them, they are unable to return again for breeding, and multitudes perish when the canals are allowed to run dry for repairs. Again, the existence of fixed weirs across the hill-streams, up which large carp proceed to breed, is a fertile source of destruction. These are constructed in Kumaon and Garhw\u00e1l at the close of the rains, and remain until the next floods. They are placed usually at the tail of each pool, or at the junction of two rivers, and effectually prevent the escape of any fish that has once got above them. Similar contrivances exist on all the small streams within the hills, and the dams made to draw off a supply of water for the small flour-mills are utilised for the same purpose. In the plains, engines, fixed and movable, are also used in the most wasteful way. Some account of the nets and other implements in use will be found in the description of each district, and here it will be useful to give the opinions of the district officials on the question of the necessity for Government interference in the preservation of fish in the Meerut Division.\n\nThe Commissioner writes:\u2014\"I think it may safely be concluded that the proportion of the population who live by fishing as a trade is not large; the proportion of persons who have no other occupation than fishing is small, but it is increased by others who resort to fishing at odd times, probably in times when they have nothing better to do. So far, then, as the fisherman class is concerned, I do not think there is much to fear of their efforts making any appreciable impression on the fish-supply. But there is a fear that, unless the reckless system of wholesale destruction is stopped, the fish-supply may become scant. There seem to be two main causes which lead to this wanton destruction of fish: the first is by\nreason of the facilities afforded for doing so in the canals and distributary channels, and the second is the absence of any check in respect of rivers.\" He continues that nets or gratings at the head of canals will be liable to be carried away in heavy floods, so proposes fish-ladders at each fall. \"The main points for consideration would be: first, to prevent damming streams for the purpose of catching fish; second, a limit to the size of the mesh in nets; third, a close season, say from first July to first October, seems to be essentially necessary, and catching fish within these dates should be prohibited. The close season need not apply to every kind of fish, but to those more generally used for food. The limit to the size of the mesh of nets would only stop the fry being caught, but the prohibition to damming or diverting streams would also prevent the wholesale destruction which now takes place.\" \"There is no doubt that the most wanton destruction of fish does take place, and that fish are disappearing from the sub-streams of the Ganges and Jumna. Where twenty or thirty years ago fish of ten or fifteen pounds could be caught, none are now to be seen except fry, and such fry the native fishermen net and snare in every way at all seasons.\n\nThe Collector of Saharanpur \"has no remarks to offer on the subject.\"\n\nOpinions of Collectors. The Collector of Meerut (February 22nd, 1872) observed that \"there is no question that considerable damage is done to the young fish, by the indiscriminate use of nets with extremely small meshes, without any regard to the spawning season, and in the smaller streams, by the practice freely resorted to by the fishermen and others of damming up the streams, drying off the portion below, and then taking out the larger fish, while the smaller are left to perish. I do not think the establishment of a close season would meet with any opposition. At the spawning season, fish are considered impure and scarcely fit for food, and it is only the very poorest part of the population that makes use of fish at that season. There would be little difficulty in the introduction of a fixed close season, and this would greatly protect the fishing interests. I think a close season from 15th June to 1st November would give a fair time for spawning and the growth of the young fry. The mesh I would recommend should be one inch and a half from knot to knot, or perhaps even two inches. Small rewards for crocodiles' eggs would aid in the extermination of those reptiles, and this could be easily arranged for.\" The Assistant Collector of Meerut reported that \"as little fishing is carried on in the rains, the destruction of breeding fish and fry is not very great. No doubt there is considerable destruction, for all fish, breeding or not, are, when caught, killed without distinction.\" Difficulties would exist in regulating the minimum size of the mesh of nets, and he is \"opposed to Government doing anything, especially as regards fry, because the subordinate native officers and the police being high-caste men among the\nHindu population, it would rest with persons quite unacquainted with distinctions in classes of fish to decide as to what is fry and what is not; while we may be sure that considerable oppression would be exercised.\" The Collector of Muzaffarnagar (March 29th, 1872) reported, first, that there is no limit to the size of mesh employed, but that nets having very small meshes are used mainly for fishing in jhils and ponds, and nets with larger meshes for river-fishing; second, that nature practically provides a close season for fish during the monsoon; third, that the consumption of fish in the district is not excessive, and consequently the destruction of small fry does not appear to take place systematically. \"Except occasionally, when fields are flooded in the rains, there does not seem anywhere, or at any time, to be any wholesale destruction of small fry;\" he sees no practical difficulty in regulating the minimum size of the meshes of nets, or prescribing a close season, but does not consider such necessary in his district.\n\nNothing, that I am aware of, has been done to carry out any of these suggestions, or to interfere in any way with the present wanton and wholesale destruction of fish. I give the names of the more common description of fish found in these provinces, with a reference to the page of Dr. Day's report, where they are described at some length. The mammals, birds, and insects will be found in the next volume, and thus a complete list will be given illustrating the natural history of these provinces.\n\nSub-fam.

The Vedas show us a colony of fair-complexioned strangers settled amongst dark-skinned, rude and uncivilised aborigines. The mode of life of these colonists was simple in the extreme. The head of the family combined in himself the office of priest and chief, and the members devoted themselves chiefly to cultivating the ground and tending cattle. Hence they spread into the Duab and eastern India. The Solar race gave kings to Ajudhiya in southern Oudh, and colonies to a great part of these provinces. One branch settled in Tirhut and founded the family of the Maithila kings, and another occupied southern Tirhut or Vaisali (Saran). The Lunar race sprung from the same stock, and occasionally intermarrying with the Solar line, gave princes to Pratishthan\u00e1, a city to the south of Ajudhiya (Ayodhya), to Kashi (Benares), Magadha and Behar; to the Vindhya hills, and across them to Berar (Vidarbha). The earliest princes of Kusasthali, on the Narbada, Dwarka in Gujrat, Hastinapur and Muttra, belong to the same race. Though there are hints of settlement in the peninsula, yet these are so indistinct, that it is difficult to say whether they belong to the original works in which they are mentioned or are interpolations of later times.\u00b9\n\nThe earliest traditions regarding these provinces are connected with the upper Duab, and there centre in Hastinapur, the ancient city of the Pandavas, situated in the parganah of Hastinapur in the Meerut District. Few traces of the old city now remain to show what its extent may have been, but universal report points out the existing shapeless kheras or mounds as the residence of the moon-descended princes of the house of Bharata, from whom came the actors in the great war mentioned in the pages of the Mahabharata. With the exception, perhaps, of the Ramayana, devoted to the achievements of the Solar race, there is no work in India which has had such influence on the Hindu mind as the Mahabharata. Its legends are as household words, and are used as commonly and naturally in the conversation and writings of the people as the mythical history of Greece and Rome and the narratives of the Sacred Scriptures are quoted in the west. And this is no decaying influence, for up to the present day, the belief is universal that\n\n\u00b9 For a popular and accurate resum\u00e9 of the facts known concerning the Vaidik and Brahmanic ages, I would refer the reader to Mrs. Manning's (Mrs. Speir) \"Ancient India,\" and for the literature and its history to Max Muller's works.\nthe perusal, or even listening to the perusal, of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata cleanses from all sin. It is impossible to understand almost any modern popular work written by Hindus for Hindu readers without at least an acquaintance with the outlines of the story of the Lunar race; so that apart from its historical interest, the records of this great family would appear to demand some notice in the present volume.\n\nSetting aside the miraculous events, which in common with the Iliad and \u00c6neid surround, as with a halo, the births and exploits of the principal heroes,\n\nHistorical value of these the residue of the narrative may be accepted as legends.\n\nfounded on facts. There is nothing unnatural in the circumstances of the dispute between the rival branches of the family of Kuru, and no reason appears for considering the whole as a gigantic fraud perpetrated by the nation at large and permitted to pervade the entire post-Vedic literature of the different Hindu communities throughout India for the purpose of deception. This is not the place for entering into a critical examination of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, as to whether it is the work of one hand or of many, or what portions have been written soon after the events they record, and what may be considered the interpolations of successive editors. Professor H. H. Wilson places the compilation at no later date than the thirteenth or fourteenth century before Christ, whilst General Cunningham fixes on the end of the fifteenth century before Christ, making the birth of Parikshit to have occurred in 1430 before Christ, six years before the great war.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 V. P. IV, 232. General Cunningham in Arch. Rep. I., 195. The grounds on which this opinion has been adopted are, (1) Bentley's statement that certain positions of the planets recorded in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata took place in 1824-5 B.C., and there is no year either before or since that period in which they were so situated. (2) The Vishnu Pur\u0101\u1e47a (V. P. IV. 232,) declares that at the birth of Parikshit the seven Rishis (the great Bear) were in M\u0101gha, and the K\u0101l\u012b age then commenced. The Rishis pass through each lunar asterism in 100 years (Ibid p. 238, note) and this gives an interval between Nanda and Parikshit of 1,000 years. All the copies of the Vishnu Pur\u0101\u1e47a give 1,010 years; the Matsya Pur\u0101\u1e47a has 1,050 years, and the Bh\u0101gavata 1,116 years. The items, however, recorded in the Bh\u0101gavata make up 1,650 years. Professor Wilson considers the shorter period is best proportioned to the number of kings; for reckoning from Sahadeva, who was a contemporary of Parikshit, there were forty-seven kings, which as the divisor of 1050 (Matsya), gives rather more than twenty-two years to each reign. The duration of the reigns of the nine Nandas will place the birth of Parikshit, according to the Vishnu Pur\u0101\u1e47a, 1,116 years before the accession of Chandragupta (Sandrakottus) in 316 B.C., or 1480 B.C., that is, six years before the great war in 1424 B.C. According to the Matsya chronology the date of Parikshit's birth will be 1465 B.C., and according to the Bh\u0101gavata, 1650 B.C. Colonel Wilford (As. Res. IX., 116) places the conclusion of the great war in 1370 B.C., and Hamilton (Buchanan) conjectures it to have occurred in the thirteenth century before Christ. Colebrooke (I. Misc. Ess., 109, 200) infers from astronomical data that the arrangement of the Vedas by Vy\u0101sa, the substituted husband of the widow of Vichitrav\u012brya, took place in the fourteenth century before Christ. Mr. Bentley (Hindu Astronomy, p. 67) brings the date of Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira to 575 B.C., but the weight of authority, according to Professor H. H. Wilson, \"is in favour of the thirteenth or fourteenth century, B.C., for the war of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, and the reputed commencement of the K\u0101l\u012b age.\" The popular date for its commencement is 3101 B.C., or the date of Noah's deluge (Mill).\nThe account given in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata may be supplemented from the genealogical portions of the Pur\u0101\u1e47as, which substantially agree with the facts recorded in the great epic.\n\nThe Pur\u0101\u1e47as are eighteen in number, compiled at different times and by various hands. The Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a, which has been translated by Professor Wilson and edited by Dr. Hall, is the principal, and next to the Bh\u0101gavata is still regarded as the great authority on matters connected with their religion by large sections of the Hindu community. Professor Wilson attributes its compilation to some time before the twelfth century of our era. According to Amara Sinha, who flourished fifty-six years before Christ, a Pur\u0101\u1e47a should contain five books, one relating to primary creation or cosmogony; the next to secondary creation, or the destruction and renovation of worlds, including chronology; thirdly, the genealogy of gods and patriarchs; fourthly, the reigns of the Manus, or periods called manvantaras; and lastly, history, giving an account of the Lunar and Solar races, and of their descendants, to modern times. None of the Pur\u0101\u1e47as come up to this standard, and the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a only in part; but so much more so than the others, that \"it is one of the circumstances which give to this work a more authentic character than most of its fellows can pretend to.\" Imperfect as they are, and disfigured by absurd stories and interpolations of later times, the Pur\u0101\u1e47as, with the great epic poems, are the chief amongst the few historical records we possess of any antiquity to assist us in compiling an account of the heroic age.\n\nThe Lunar race in the Pur\u0101\u1e47as are descended from Brahma, who sprang from the lotus forming the navel of Nar\u0101yana. From Brahma came Atri, and from Atri, Soma or the moon, whom\n\n---\n\n1 Collected works, Vols. VI. to X.: London, 1869-71.\n2 Professor Wilson writes:\u2014\"The different works known by the name of Pur\u0101\u1e47as are evidently derived from the same religious system as the Ram\u0101ya\u1e47a and Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, or from the mytho-heroic stage of Hindu belief. They present, however, peculiarities which designate their belonging to a later period, and to an important modification in the progress of opinion. They repeat the theoretical cosmogony of the two great poems; they expand and systematize the chronological computations; and they give a more definite and connected representation of the mythological fictions and the historical traditions. But, besides these and other particulars, which may be derivable from an old, if not from a primitive era, they offer characteristic peculiarities of a more modern description, in the paramount importance which they assign to individual divinities, in the variety and purport of the rites and observances addressed to them, and in the invention of new legends illustrative of the power and gracilousness of those deities, and of the efficacy of implicit devotion to them. \u015aiva and Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, under one or other form, are almost the sole objects that claim the homage of the Hind\u016bs in the Pur\u0101\u1e47as, departing from the domestic and elemental ritual of the Vedas, and exhibiting a sectarian fervour and exclusiveness not traceable in the Ram\u0101ya\u1e47a, and only to a qualified extent in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata. They are no longer authorities for Hindu belief, as a whole: they are special guides for separate and sometimes conflicting branches of it; compiled for the evident purpose of promoting the preferential, or, in some cases, the sole worship of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u or of \u015aiva.\" (V. P. I., v.)\nBrahma installed as the sovereign of Brahmans, plants and the stars. Soma, by an intrigue with Tara, the wife of Brihaspati, preceptor of the gods, had a son named Budha, who married Ila, a daughter of the sun. To him was born Puru-ruvas who, by the nymph Urvasi, had six sons, the eldest of whom was named Ayus. Yayati, the son of Ayus, had five sons, to whom he severally applied to remove the premature decay under which he suffered owing to the curse of his father-in-law. All refused to undergo the privations of old age except Puru, the youngest, who willingly gave his youth to his father and became an aged man. Yayati, touched with the piety of his youngest son, subsequently determined to resume his decrepitude. He called all his sons before him and restored to Puru his youth, and distributed amongst them all his kingdom. To Turvasu he gave the south-east of his kingdom, and his posterity ended with Marutta, who adopted Dushyantu of the race of Puru. Druhyu' was made prince of the west, Anu of the north, and Yadu of the south. All were directed to govern as viceroys of Puru, who was declared monarch of the whole earth.\n\nYadu had several sons, and amongst his descendants were Krishna and Balarama, the allies of the Pandavas. In the line of Puru came Dushyantu, who was adopted by his cousin Marutta, and had by Sakuntala, the mighty king Bharata, the emperor of the entire earth. He is the first great king of the race, and to this day India is known amongst Hindus as Bharatavarsha, or the country of Bharata. Amongst his descendants come Sahotra, the father of Hastin, who founded Hastinapura. Hastin had three sons, the eldest of whom was named Ajamirha. The sovereignty of Hastinapura itself remained in the hands of his son Rikshu, who was succeeded by Samvarana. Haryaswa, the fifth in descent from Nila, the brother of Rikshu, had five sons, of whom their father said\u2014\"These my five (pancha) sons are able (alam) to protect the countries,\" and hence they were termed Panchalas. Even thus early dissensions existed in the family, for we find from the Mahabharata that the Panchalas expelled their cousin Samvarana from Hastinapur, which was again recovered by his son Kuru, who gave his name to the holy district of Kurukshetra. In the Puranas the possessions of the Kauravas and the Panchalas form the middle districts of Bharatavarsha. To the\n\n---\n\n1 The sons of Prachetas, the eighth in descent from Druhyu, are subsequently said (V. P. IV., 119) to have been the \"princes of the lawless Mlechchas of the north,\" while the Mahabharata calls them \"Vaibhojas, a people unacquainted with the use of carts or beasts of burden, and who travel on rafts; they have no kings.\" As king of the south-east he should rule over Arakan and Ava, but many authorities derive the nations of the peninsula also from him (Ibid, 117.)\n\n2 The legend of Dushyantu and Sakuntala has been dramatised by Kalidasa in his beautiful poem of Sakuntala, or \"Sakuntala recognized by the ring,\" the scene of which is laid in the Bijnor District. (Ed. Williams: Hertford, 1855.)\n\n3 Near Thanesar.\u2014Cunningham, Anc. Geogr., 331.\nPanch\u0101la family belonged Drupada, in whose reign their possessions were divided. Drona, with the assistance of the P\u0101ndavas, conquered the entire kingdom, and then ceded the southern portion to Drupada. Panch\u0101la at this time would seem to include the entire tract of country to the north and west of Delhi, from the Siwalik (Shiwalak) hills to the Chambal. In the southern portion, the principal cities were Makand\u012b on the Ganges, and K\u0101mpilya or Kampil in the Farukhabad District; Ahichhatra in the Barailly (Baroli) District was the chief city of northern Panch\u0101la.\n\nFrom Jahnu, the son of Kuru, was descended the R\u0101ja S\u0101ntanu, who had, by the river goddess Ganga, the great S\u0101ntanava. S\u0101ntanu in his old age desired a young wife, and S\u0101ntanava procured him such a one in Saty\u0101vati, but the girl's parents refused to give their consent, on the ground that S\u0101ntanava would succeed to the throne before their daughter's son. On hearing this, S\u0101ntanava, to please his father, vowed a life of celibacy, and gave up his right to the throne to the offspring of Saty\u0101vati. Henceforward he went by the name of Bhishma or \"the dreadful,\" on account of his dreadful vow. Saty\u0101vati bore two sons, Chitr\u0101ngada and Vichitrav\u012brya. The first was killed in conflict with the Gandharvas or inhabitants of the hilly tracts to the north, and the latter married the two daughters of the king of K\u0101shi (Benares). Vichitrav\u012brya died without issue, and his mother thereupon applied to his half-brother Bhishma to raise up sons to continue the line. Bhishma's vow of celibacy precluded him from undertaking the task. The R\u0101ni Dowager then ordered her son Vy\u0101sa to take to wife his half brother's widows. The offspring of this marriage was Dhritarashtra, the blind, P\u0101ndu the pale, and, by a slave-girl, Vidura.\n\nThe three boys were brought up by their uncle Bhishma, who on their coming of age set aside Dhritarashtra, because he was blind, and Vidura, because of his lowly birth, and elevated P\u0101ndu to the r\u0101j of Bh\u0101rata. Amongst the S\u0101tvatas descended from Kroshtu son of Y\u0101du was a prince named S\u016bra, who gave his daughter Pritha to Bhoja or Kuat\u012b-bhoja, a r\u0101ja who dwelt on the Vindhya mountains. She married P\u0101ndu and bore to him Yudhishthira, Bhima and Arjuna, who, owing to P\u0101ndu, from a curse pronounced on him, being unable to procreate children, were in reality the offspring of the deities Dharma, V\u0101yu (the air), and Indra. Before her marriage with P\u0101ndu, Pritha or Kunti had a son (Karna) by the divine\n\n---\n\n1Satya dhriti, a Panch\u0101la prince, had a daughter by Urv\u0101si, whom he abandoned. She was found by R\u0101ja S\u0101ntanu, who brought her up and gave her in marriage to Drona; she bore to him A\u015bvatthama.\u2014V. F. IV., 146. 2Saty\u0101vati is said to have borne Vy\u0101sa or Krishna-dwaip\u0101yana, the relator of the Vishnu Pur\u0101\u1e47a to Par\u0101sara, before her marriage with S\u0101ntanu. He also was therefore a half brother of Vichitrav\u012brya, and as such was then legally entitled to marry his deceased brother's widows.\nAditya (the sun,) whom she exposed, while still an infant, on the banks of the Jumna. He was found there by Adiratha, the s\u00e1ha or charioteer of king S\u00fara, who brought him up as his own son. P\u00e1ndu had a second wife named M\u00e1dri, who bore him, by the twin sons of Aditya (N\u00e1satya and D\u00e1sra), the brothers N\u00e1kula and S\u00e1hadeva. P\u00e1ndu died soon afterwards, and was succeeded in the r\u0101j\u00e1 by Dhritar\u00e1shta, who married a daughter of the R\u00e1ja of G\u00e1ndh\u00e1ra (Peshawar). She bore him Duryodhana, Duhs\u00e1sana, and other sons to the number of one hundred, known henceforth as the Kauravas, from their progenitor, Kuru, to distinguish them from the P\u00e1ndavas, the five sons of P\u00e1ndu.\n\nThe youths of both families were brought up together in Hastin\u00e1pur, and were instructed in the use of arms by Drona, who had quarrelled with the Panch\u00e1l\u00e1 R\u00e1ja Drupada, and taken up his residence with Bh\u00edsha. Drona made one condition with them, that on their acquiring a thorough knowledge of their weapons, his pupils should assist him in fighting against Drupada. Yudhi\u00e1thira became a proficient in the use of the spear; Arjuna was the most famous archer of his time; Bh\u00edma learned the use of the club; N\u00e1kula, the management of horses, and S\u00e1hadeva became an expert swordsman. Arjuna and Bh\u00edma were the favourite pupils of Drona, and on this account excited the jealousy of Duryodhana and his brethren the Kauravas. The military school soon became famous, and many sons of R\u00e1jas flocked for instruction to Drona, and amongst them the son of the R\u00e1ja of the Bhils, whom, as a barbarian, Drona refused to instruct. Nothing daunted, the Bhil prince set up an image of clay to represent Drona, and learned archery by practising before the image. On seeing this Drona permitted the Bhil to continue the practice, but bound him by an oath to use the middle finger alone in drawing the string, hence this custom is said to have descended amongst the Bhils to the present day. Continuous public assaults of arms were held by the pupils of Drona, with whom many strangers tried their strength.\n\nThe Kauravas, according to the compact with Drona, first attempted the reduction of Panch\u00e1l\u00e1, but were unsuccessful. The P\u00e1ndavas however succeeded, and this added to the jealousy with which they were regarded by their cousins. This was further\n\n---\n\n1 See Wheeler's History, I., 93.  \n2 For a fuller account of the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata, see Wheeler's History of India, Vol. I.: London, 1867; and for a translation of the entire poem, see Fauche; Paris, 1863-70.  \n3 Drona was the son of the preceptor Bharadwaja, and was brought up by his father with Drupada, son of Prihata, the R\u00e1ja of Panch\u00e1l\u00e1. When both grew up, Drupada treated Drona with disrespect and continually taunted him with his inferiority, as a mendicant Brahman, to the position of himself as a Kshatriya R\u00e1ja. On this account Drona sought revenge.  \n4 Hence the monoliths bearing Asok\u00e1's edicts are popularly known as Bh\u00edma Sen ke gadd, or 'Bh\u00edma Sen's club.'  \n5 Karna, the charioteer, first appears in public at one of these assemblies.\nheightened by the contest for the post of heir-apparent or Yuvar\u0101ja, which was conferred on Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira by Dhritar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra. But to such a height did their contentions go, that the Mah\u0101r\u0101ja recommended the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas to proceed for a time to V\u0101ran\u0101vata (Allahabad), until matters could be arranged.\u00b9\n\nThere Duryodhana caused them to be lodged in a house smeared with lac and other combustible materials, with the intention of burning the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas and their mother Kunti in it.\u00b2 From this fate they were delivered by digging an underground passage, at the suggestion of Vidura, through which they escaped unnoticed to the great jungle. Here they met with many adventures: Bh\u012bma subdued the Rakshasa Hidimba, whose daughter he married, and the cannibal Asura V\u0101ka, who used to devour daily one of the inhabitants of the city of Ekachakra, identified with the modern Ara (Arrah).\n\nOn their departure from Ekachakra, the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas heard of the approaching swayamvara\u00b3 of Draupadi, the beautiful daughter of the Panch\u0101la king Drupada. They proceeded to K\u0101mpilya, the residence of the R\u0101ja, and there Draupadi was won by the prowess of Arjuna, who struck the eye of the golden fish through the chakr\u0101 at the first discharge from his bow. The catalogue of the R\u0101jas attending the assembly is of some interest, as showing the principal kingdoms of those days. From Dw\u0101raka came Krishna and B\u0101lir\u0101ma; from the north-west the R\u0101ja of Sindhu (Indus), and the sons of the R\u0101ja of G\u0101ndh\u0101ra (Peshawar); from the east came Vatsar\u0101ja, the R\u0101ja of Kosala (Berar), J\u0101rasandha, R\u0101ja of Magadha (Bahar), and the R\u0101ja of Paundra (Bengal proper); from the south came the R\u0101ja of Chhedi (on the Narbada), the R\u0101ja of Vir\u0101ta (Mataya),\u2074 and the R\u0101ja of Madra (Panjab). Draupadi married the five brothers, and returning to Hastin\u0101pura it was resolved to divide the r\u0101j. The P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas took the western half known as Kh\u0101ndava-prastha, and founded the city of Indra-prastha on the bank of the Jumna. They then burned the forest and drove out the N\u0101gas and their R\u0101ja Takshaka from the neighbourhood, and built separate houses for themselves. Draupadi lived in turn with each of the brethren, and it was agreed amongst them that \"if a brother entered the house of another brother while Draupadi was dwelling there, he should depart into exile for twelve years.\" Arjuna broke this rule first, and in consequence set out from Indra-prastha to visit other countries. Amongst the places visited by him are Hardw\u0101r on the Ganges, where he had an intrigue with Ul\u016bpi, the daughter of V\u0101suki, the R\u0101ja of the N\u0101gas. He then went to Mahendra or Malabar, where he visited Parasur\u0101m;\u2075 and next to Manipura.\n\n\u00b9 There is good reason for believing that this episode of the exile to V\u0101ran\u0101vata is an interpolation of later times. \u00b2 See V. P. IV., 80. \u00b3 The swayamvara gave the woman, as the prize of skill and valour, to the most distinguished of the competitors, or allowed her to choose from amongst the suitors for her hand. \u2074 A kingdom to the west of Muttra in Gwalior. \u2075 See Vishnu Pur\u0101\u1e47a, IV., 24.\nwhere he married Chitr\u00e1ngad\u00e1, the daughter of the R\u00e1ja. We then find him at Dw\u00e1rka in the Y\u00e1dava country, where he met Krishna and B\u00e1l\u00e1r\u00e1ma, and espoused their sister Subhadra, with whom he returned to Indra-prastha.\n\nIn the meantime the new settlement prospered so much, that Yudhishthira resolved to celebrate the royal sacrifice\u00b9 (rajasacrifice) intended as an assertion of sovereignty as well as a sacrifice to the gods. Yudhishthira had previously subdued many of the neighbouring R\u00e1jas, and it is even said that Bh\u00edma and Arjuna had visited Magadha and slain J\u00e1rasandha. To complete the preparations, Yudhishthira sent his four brethren to the four quarters of the earth to collect tribute from all countries for the space of a year. On their return all assembled at a great feast in the council hall, including representatives of the four castes,\u00b2 when the argha\u00b3 was presented to Krishna as the most important personage present. In return for this Krishna slew Sisup\u00e1la, R\u00e1ja of Chhedi, for presuming to interfere with the sacrifice. The success of the inauguration of the new r\u0101j induced Duryodhana to plan fresh schemes whereby he might dispossess the P\u00e1ndavas. For this purpose he induced his father to invite the P\u00e1ndavas to Hastin\u00e1pur, and there inveigled them into a gambling match with his uncle Sakuni. In the game Yudhishthira lost his kingdom, his brethren, himself, and finally his wife Draupadi. A terrible scene then ensued. Draupadi was insulted by Duryodhana, and at length released by his father, who arranged that there should be another game, at which whoever lost should give up his r\u0101j and depart into exile for twelve years in a jungle, and one year in a city in disguise. If discovered during the year they lived in disguise they were again to go through their exile. The P\u00e1ndavas again lost the game, and leaving their mother Kunt\u00ed under the care of Vidura, set out into exile.\n\nFor twelve years they wandered through the forest with Draupadi,\u2074 occasionally visiting holy places and living on the game they shot on the way. Arjuna visited the Him\u00e1layas,\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 These sacrifices, as observed by Mr. Wheeler, underwent several modifications. The original type, or the coronation banquet, was subsequently converted into sacrificial sessions of a purely religious character; then came the Buddhists, who substituted other offerings for animals; and finally the homa (clarified butter), and p\u0101yasa (rice and milk) came in with the Brahmanical revival in the ninth century.\n\n\u00b2 \"All Brahmans and Kshatriyas, and all the respectable Vai\u015byas and Sudras.\"\n\n\u00b3 The argha is an offering of flowers, milk or honey still made to idols, or a Brahman, or a bridegroom on his wedding day.\n\n\u2074 Draupadi bore five sons, one to each of the P\u00e1ndavas: the son of Yudhishthira was Prat\u00edvindhya; of Bh\u00edmasena was Srutasoma; of Arjuna, Srutak\u00edrtti; N\u00e1kula begot Sa\u00f1\u00e1\u00f1ika; and Sahadeva, Srutakarm\u00e1n. In his notes on the history of Kashmir (As. Res. XV., II.) Prof. Wilson alludes to the traditions which make Kashmir the native seat of the P\u00e1ndavas. Besides the history of Kashmir, which positively asserts that 52 kings of the Kaurava family ruled there, Wilford shows, from Hindu authorities, that the city of the P\u00e1ndavas was in the valley; and even the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata makes \"the holy mountain of Himavat\" the birthplace of the five sons of Pandu.\nwhere, by propitiating Siva, he became possessed of powerful weapons. Whilst in the jungles the P\u00e1ndavas heard that the Kauravas had been captured by the Gandharvas of the hills, and returning good for evil rescued them from their enemies. This was not the only adventure that befell them, for the R\u00e1ja of Sindhu, passing by the hermitage of the P\u00e1ndavas during their absence, saw Draupadi, and falling in love with her, carried her off, when she was with difficulty rescued by Yudhishthira. For the year of exile in disguise the P\u00e1ndavas chose the city of R\u00e1ja Vir\u00e1ta (Matya), and entered into his service under assumed names. They remained there for the year, and defeated an attack of the Kauravas and the R\u00e1ja of Trigarta (Hill State of Kotoch). The P\u00e1ndavas then disclosed their real origin and made an alliance with the R\u00e1ja, confirmed by the marriage of his daughter Uttara with Abhimanyu, the son of Arjuna by Subhadra. At a council held immediately after the marriage feast, it was resolved to send an embassy to Hastin\u00e1pur to demand the restoration of Indra-prastha. Drupada despatched his family priest on behalf of the P\u00e1ndavas, and Dhritar\u00e1sbtra and Bhishma lent a favourable ear to their application; but Karna\\(^1\\) and Duryodhana were intractable, urging that they had discovered the P\u00e1ndavas before the expiration of the thirteenth year. Sanjaya, the charioteer of the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja, was, however, despatched to the P\u00e1ndavas, but the negotiations ended in disappointment, nor did Krishna fare better in his efforts at mediation.\n\nWar was resolved on by both sides, forces were collected, and every preparation made. Both Kauravas and P\u00e1ndavas marched to the plain of Kurakshetra near P\u00e1nipat, and there entrenched themselves. Bhishma was appointed generalissimo of the Kauravas, and Dhrishtadyumna, son of R\u00e1ja Drupada, filled the same office on the side of the P\u00e1ndavas. Every precaution was observed. A lake lay between the P\u00e1ndavas and their enemies, on one side was the Saraswati river, and on the other a deep trench was dug, while sentries were posted, and signs and passwords were appointed by which they might recognize their own people. A challenge\\(^2\\) was then sent by Duryodhana to the P\u00e1ndavas, filled with the most insulting references to the events that had taken place, and this was replied to by Arjuna. The next step was the formation of a code of rules by the commanders of each army for ameliorating the horrors of war, which, however disregarded during the war in individual instances, were generally adhered to.\\(^3\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Karna owed Arjuna a grudge on account of Draupadi's objecting to his candidature at her swayamvara because of his suspicious parentage.\n\n\\(^2\\) The herald charged with the message recapitulates all the wrongs the P\u00e1ndavas had suffered at the hands of their cousins, and dares them to take revenge; in fact the harangue is something of the nature of the speeches Fenimore Cooper puts in the mouths of his American Indian heroes.\n\n\\(^3\\) These 'Geneva' rules deserve reproduction. They are\u2014(1) We agree not to make war by stratagem or treachery. (2) When fighting we will fight to death, but when we leave off we may visit each other, hold conference together, or meet\nThe battle opened with the usual shouting and clanging of drums and conch shells, and lasted for eighteen days. The P\u0101ndava commander remained to the last, but on the tenth day the Kauravas lost Bh\u012bshma, slain by Arjuna. Bh\u012bshma was succeeded by Drona for five days; on his death Karna assumed the command for two days only, when he also was slain. S\u0101tya was the Kaurava commander on the last day. The narrative of the battle during the first ten days is little more than a description of a succession of charges, and the conversations of the principal actors on the day's events. On the twelfth day some curious tactics were displayed. The Kauravas were drawn up as a spider's web and entirely surrounded their enemies until relieved by Abhimanyu, who charged them repeatedly, and while doing so lost his life. The battle was then renewed by torchlight, and on the fourteenth day Drona fell at the hands of Drishtadyumna. The principal events of the two days during which Karna commanded are the fight between Bh\u012bma and Duhs\u0101sana, when Bh\u012bma fulfilled his vow of drinking the blood of Duhs\u0101sana, on account of an insult offered by him to Draupadi; and the fight between Arjuna and Karna, in which the latter was slain. S\u0101tya, R\u0101ja of Madra, who commanded on the last day, was slain by Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, and but three warriors were left to the Kauravas. On seeing this, Duryodhana concealed himself amid the bulrushes in the lake, but was discovered and compelled to fight with Bh\u012bma. Both were wounded in the encounter, and the conflict ceased. The P\u0101ndavas then proceeded to plunder the camp of the Kauravas, but during their absence Aswatthama, the son of Drona, one of the surviving Kaurava warriors, entered the P\u0101ndava camp and slew not only their general Drishtadyumna, but also the five sons of Draupadi. Duryodhana died of his wounds on the field. The next scene represents the reconciliation of the P\u0101ndavas with Dhritarashtra, the visit of the wives and families of the deceased warriors to the field of battle, and the cremation ceremonies.\n\nAfter the funeral ceremonies were completed, Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira proceeded to Hastin\u0101pur, where he was installed as R\u0101ja, under Dhritar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra, and attempted the celebration of the great\n\nInstallation of Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira.\n\ntogether. (3) We will spare all drummers, charioteers, those that run away and those that lay down their arms. (4) Horsemen alone shall fight with horsemen, elephant riders with the same class, footmen with footmen, and those in chariots with warriors in chariots. (5) When warriors are only abusing each other they shall not also use arms. (6) No man shall take up arms against another without giving him warning. (7) When two combatants are engaged together, no third person shall interfere. These unique rules need no comment, and even here the chronicler is forced to say very often \"they fought fairly for an hour or two, and then like drunken Asuras, they forgot all the laws of fair fighting, and fell to in great confusion.\"\n\nBefore commencing, Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira piously asked permission of his preceptors Bh\u012bshma and Drona to attack them.\naswamedha or horse-sacrifice.\\(^1\\) Arjuna led the army which followed the horse with many adventures for one year, and returned successfully to Hastinapura, where the great sacrifice was made with homa of curds, milk and clarified butter. For some time after this all lived in peace; until Dhritarashtra, mindful of the death of his sons at the hands of Bhima, determined to separate from the Pandavas, and with his family retired to the jungles on the banks of the Ganges, where they all perished in a jungle fire. From Dwarka, too, news came of the death of Krishna and Balarama, and the destruction of the city by a cyclone. Oppressed by these disasters, the Pandavas resolved to abandon worldly affairs, and gave the raja of Hastinapura to Parikshit, the son of Abhimanyu by Uttara, and grandson of Arjun, and the raja of Indra-prastha to Yuyutsu, the only surviving son of Dhritarashtra. Then, assuming the garb of devotees, they passed forth from the city towards the rising sun, and reached the Himalaya mountains, where they died.\n\nThe preceding story gives us the history of the fortunes of the first great outpost of the Aryan immigrants after they passed State of society. the Saraswati to Brahmarshi-desa, or the land of the Rishis or Sages. It also marks the commencement of the Brahmanical period, when the Brahmans first began to assume the exclusive direction of religious ceremonies, and the permanent distinctions of caste began to be established. The Puranas make mention of Brahmans being descended from several of the ancestors of the Pandavas; of others it is said that they were progenitors of\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The aswamedha seems to have been of a more important character than the rajadnya. In the former the mere proposal to sacrifice carries with it the idea of universal sovereignty, while the latter seems to consist for the most part of the mere inauguration ceremonies of a new State. In the aswamedha, a horse was taken of a black colour or 'of a pure white colour like the moon, with a yellow tail and a black ear,' and was allowed to run loose wherever he willed for the space of one year. The Raja and his army followed the horse into every country, and wherever it went the Rajas were obliged either to fight or submit. At the expiration of the year, if always victorious, the Raja and his army, accompanied by the other Rajas whom he had subdued, returned to his city, where a grand sacrifice was made, at which the horse was killed and eaten by the guests. Before the sacrifice the principal actor and his wife bathed, and then the ground was measured off by the Raja and ploughed by him, while the Rani sowed a portion of each kind of seed, and the Brahmans and women prayed. The ground was then paved with golden bricks, and eight pillars and a canopy were erected of the same material. Then eight large pits were dug and eight ladies made for the homa of curds, milk and clarified butter, in which skins stuffed with every edible vegetable were placed. Water was brought from the Ganges by the principal guests and their wives, on whom the Raja in return bestowed garlands of jewels, and gave them betel-nut to eat, and at last a fire was lighted in each pit, and the various ingredients for the homa were presented to it. The Raja was then bathed in the Ganges water as well as the horse; the horse was then decapitated and opened for the discovery of omens, after which portions of his flesh were added to the homa, and the remainder was distributed among the guests. The assembly closed with the ceremony of bathing the Raja and his wife with Ganges water by the assembled guests and their wives.\nrepresentatives of the four castes. The sage Vy\u0101sa himself, the compiler of the Vedas and the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, was the reputed father of the Kshatriya P\u0101ndavas. All through the Vaidik records the Brahman is held to be inferior to the Kshatriya, and even here we see it in the treatment Drona received at the hands of Drupada. At the same time the gradual reversal of the position of the two classes may be traced, and the gradual submission of brute force to intellect. The legends also show the processes of early colonization. When the settlement at Hastin\u0101pur became overpopulated, a colony was formed on the Jumna, whose first care was to burn down the forest and drive out the aboriginal tribes known as N\u0101gas, Daityas, Asuras and Bhils. The conquerors frequently took to themselves wives from these peoples, or were adopted into their families. The form of government was a patriarchal despotism, the connecting link between the family rule of the Vaidik age and the monarchical institutions of later times. Submission to the head of the family and the preceptor was regarded as a sacred duty. Polyandry\\(^1\\) was practised, as well as the custom still existing among semi-aboriginal tribes such as J\u0101ts, G\u016bjars, Ah\u012brs, P\u0101s\u0101s, Cham\u0101rs, &c., of marrying the widow of a deceased kinsman. The only instance of sat\u012b, or the burning of wives with their deceased husbands, is clearly a modern interpolation. Hunting and athletic sports were the principal amusements, while all engaged in agriculture, the chief himself marking its dignity by ploughing the ground with a golden plough at the great sacrifice. Cattle, too, formed a great portion of their wealth, and every third year there was an expedition to the forests to brand all the calves that had been born. The weapons in use were the sling, lasso, spear, club, bow and sword. Horsemanship was considered an accomplishment, and driving the chariot of the R\u0101ja was an office of high rank, and only held by a confidential servant. The uprohit and the charioteer frequently appear as the advisers, ministers and ambassadors of the R\u0101ja. The women of the family showed themselves in public, and were present at the great feasts, where wine and flesh were freely partaken of. At the svayamvara, women were allowed to choose their husbands among the suitors, and even where given away as a prize to the victor in the tournament, had a right to exclude an unwelcome suitor from the trial. They also presided over the distribution of food and all the household arrangements, but even here the mother-in-law was the head of the spindle-side.\\(^2\\) The most popular vice of the Kshatriyas was gambling, while the aboriginal tribes seem to have been addicted to drunkenness. Altogether the picture still presented to us is that\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) At the same time P\u0101ndu had two wives and Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra had only one.\n\n\\(^2\\) Witness the story of the mother of the R\u0101ja of Badravati, who, when invited to accompany her son to the assembly, replied \"I will never quit this house; for if I stir, all the goods and chattels here will be used up. My maids and servants will be every day plundering milk and grain and butter, so that when I return half my property will be wasted or stolen.\"\nof a family of fair-complexioned immigrants, with their dependants and followers, settling down in a land clothed with forest and inhabited by dark-skinned wandering tribes. Their chief wealth lay in their cattle, but they brought with them also the arts of agriculture. Increasing numbers and a settled life carried with them new wants and modified the form of government. Each colony from the parent stock in course of time assumed independence, and became mindful of its own interests alone. Hence numerous petty states arose, which, in the natural course of events, sought each to aggrandise itself at the expense of the others, until one became paramount; and, whilst permitting a certain amount of independence, assumed a general control. Instead of the great council, where all Brahmans and Kshatriyas and even respectable Vaisyas and Sudras were present and gave their opinions, the power gradually centred in the R\u00e1ja alone, who was assisted by a minister and a commander of the forces. When the numbers were small, every one who might be called upon to assist in the defence of the State had a voice in its deliberations; with increasing civilisation the privilege became confined to the Brahmans and the Kshatriyas, until the former became supreme as the spiritual counsellors and trusted advisers of the king.\n\nThe Vishnu Pur\u00e1na continues the history given in the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata, and from it we learn that Parikshit had four sons, Janamejaya, Srutasena, Ugrasena and Bhimasena. From Janamejaya came S\u00e1tanika, whose son was Aswamedhadatta or 'he who was given by reason of a horse-sacrifice.' To him succeeded Adhisima Krishna, whose son was named N\u00edchakru. In his reign the capital was transferred from Hastin\u00e1pur to Kaus\u00e1mbi, in consequence of the former city having been swept away by the Ganges. After him came twenty-one princes, ending with Kshemaka. Giving a reign of 18 years each to these princes, their dynasty would end in the tenth century before Christ.\n\nNo traces of the ancient Indrapratha now remain, with, perhaps, the exception of the Nigambodh Gh\u00e1t immediately outside the northern wall of the city of Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1nabad. This is celebrated as the place where Yudhishthira caused the eight pits to be dug for the reception of the homa at his great horse-sacrifice. The site of the ancient city is traditionally connected with the space between the kotila of Fir\u00faz Shah and the tomb of Hum\u00e1yun, within which lies the fort of Indarpat or Pur\u00e1na Kila. The old bed of the Jumna, lying one mile to the westward of its present\n\n---\n\n1 I can merely give a most meagre outline of the story contained in this wonderful poem, but feel convinced that in the apparently most puerile and absurd of its legends there must be some germ of fact, which a careful study of the poem as a whole, and the different works bearing upon it, would discover, and afford materials for a genuine 'History of India' during the Hindu period.\n\n2 Kaus\u00e1mbi has been identified with Ko\u015bim on the Jumna, near Allahabad. See the volume relating to the Allahabad Division.\n\n3 Wheeler's History, I, 438.\ncourse, is easily traced beneath the walls of the old fort. The R\u0101j\u0101vali and Bh\u0101gavata Pur\u0101\u1e47a make the Indraprastha line of princes continue in the family of Arjuna. Kshemaka of Hastin\u0101pura was deposed by his minister Visarwa, a contemporary of Sisun\u0101ga of Magadha. Taking the birth of Parikshit in 1430 B.C., and his accession to the throne in 1400 B.C., and giving 18 years each to the reigns of the thirty princes of his line, this would bring the revolution of Visarwa to 860 B.C. Again, adding the reigns of the Nandas (100 years) and those of the Saisun\u0101gas (362 years) to the date of the accession of Chandragupta (315 B.C.), we have the date 777 B.C., or a difference of about 89 years, which, in this arbitrary mode of calculating the duration of reigns, is not to be considered conclusive of the existence of any substantial error. Visarwa was succeeded by thirteen other princes of the same family, ending with Madpal, who was slain by his Rajput minister Mah\u0101r\u0101j or Mahraje, of the Gantam clan.\n\nMahraje, who is probably the Mah\u0101r\u0101je of Firisha, was followed by fourteen princes of the same family, ending with Antinai, who resigned his kingdom to his minister, the founder of the Mayura dynasty. The last of these princes, R\u0101jap\u0101la, is said to have been attacked and killed by the R\u0101ja of Kumaon, called S\u0101k\u0101ditya or 'lord of the S\u0101kas.' Colonel Tod states that R\u0101jap\u0101la invaded Kumaon and was killed by Sakwanti, who seized on Indraprastha, whence he was expelled by Vikram\u0101ditya. Regarding the identity of this Vikram\u0101ditya, the authorities are conflicting. \"The Hindu accounts of Vikram\u0101ditya are not to be found in the regular Paur\u0101\u1e47ik histories, but only in separate legends, such as the Vikrama-charitra and others mentioned by Wilford,\" all teeming with confusion, contradictions and absurdities in an unusual degree. The genealogical tables of the Solar and the Lunar lines contain no such name; neither does it occur among the few notices of embassies to and from India to Syria and Rome, in the authors of the west.\" It has even been hinted that the name of Vikram\u0101ditya and the Bactrian Greek Eukratides \"bear a close resemblance both in sound and in signification; while the epoch and the scene of their martial exploits are nearly identical.\" Following up this train of reasoning, General Cunningham has identified the Vikram\u0101ditya of 57 B.C. with the Hima Kadphises of the coins, an Indo-Saythian prince.\n\n---\n\n1 Arch. Rep. I., 136. Dehli is now beyond the limits of these Provinces, and its history can only be very briefly given here, and only so far as it illustrates the local history of the Du\u0101h. Mr. B\u0101glar's survey of the antiquities of Dehli and its environs will be found in Arch. Rep. Vol. IV.\n\n2 Colonel Tod's list, Ward's list (I., 24), and General Cunningham's list (J. A. S. Ben. VII.) of this dynasty are given in Prinsep's Essays, II., 289. Tiefenthaler (Bernoulli, I., 152) continues the list through Vikram\u0101ditya's descendants, through the Bais R\u0101ja Tilokchand and a Bengal dynasty, to the dynasty founded by the lord of Badordes, who was succeeded by the Chauh\u0101nas.\n\n3 As, Res. IX., 117.\n\n4 Prinsep, I., 187; II., 249, 250.\nWith the advent of the S\u0101kas the name of Dilli first appears, which, according to one tradition, was given to it by a R\u0101ja Dilli or Dhilu, its founder. Firishta adopts this account, and makes R\u0101ja Dhilu reign for some time and succumb to the arms of R\u0101ja Phor or Porus of Kumaon, who is identified by General Cunningham with the S\u0101k\u0101diya of the R\u0101j\u0101vali. The overthrow of the S\u0101kas is commonly attributed to the Vikram\u0101ditya, who assumed the title of S\u0101k\u0101ri, and established the era dating from 57 B.C., which is still in common use throughout Northern Hindustan.\n\nIt is, however, more probable that the defeat of the S\u0101ka conqueror of Dilli should be placed in 78 A.D., the initial date of the S\u0101ke-era of S\u0101liv\u0101hana, and the foundation by R\u0101ja Dhilu in 57 B.C., who was displaced immediately after by an Indo-Scythian prince. Tradition declares that Dehli was deserted from the time of its conquest by Vikram\u0101ditya to its being rebuilt by Anang P\u0101l, the first Tomar prince. The existence of the iron pillar set up by a R\u0101ja Dhava during the fourth century, and, if correct, the identification of the Daidala and Indabara of Ptolemy with Dehli and Indarpat, would, however, at least show that it was inhabited during this period.\n\nSome slight light is thrown on the early history of the Upper Du\u00e1b from the chronicles of the Buddhist rulers and travellers.\n\nAmongst the ancient remains still existing at Dehli are two stone pillars, bearing the edicts of the great king Asoka. One of these was brought by Fir\u016bz Shah Tughlak from a place called Topur, Tobra, Tamera or Nabera, on the banks of the Jumna, in the district of S\u0101laura, not far from Khizrabad, \"which is at the foot of the mountains, ninety kos from Dehli\" in the Sah\u0101runpur District. The second pillar, recently restored and standing near Hindu Rao's house, was brought by the same ruler from Meerut. Both of them contain inscriptions in the P\u0101li language, written by order of Asoka or Priyadarsin, who reigned in Magadha or Behar from 263 B.C. to 223 B.C. Similar inscriptions are found on the Allahabad stone pillar (l\u0101\u1e6d), and on the rocks at Girnar in K\u0101thiwar; at Kapurdigiri near Peshawar; at Dhauli in Orissa, and at K\u0101lsi on the Jumna, in the Dehra D\u016bn, a short distance north of Khizrabad. These are\n\n---\n\n1 See on this point Arch. Rep. I., 140. Tiefenthaler (Bernoulli, I., 125) has the same story, but gives the name Rasen.\n2 Prinsep has translated this inscription (Ess. I., 320). It records the erection of the pillar in commemoration of the victorious prowess of Dhava, who seems to have deceased prior to its completion. Dhava's forces subdued the Vahlikas on the Sindhu, so that even at the time of the inscription, his army \"and defence on the south of the river are sacredly respected by them.\" Though it is not necessary that Dehli must have been either the original site of the pillar, or, if it were erected there, that Dhava had his residence in Dehli, yet its presence shows that there must have been some inhabitants in the place. Mr. Prinsep connects the Vahlikas here mentioned with the Bacirian Greeks of Balkh, who receded before the Scythians to the south of the Paropamisan range.\n3 In A. H., 752 to 790; Prinsep, Ess.

Local tradition makes the K\u00e1lsi stone the boundary between the Hunas on the north and the Emperors of Hindustan on the south. The subject of the extent and character of Asoka's rule will be more fully considered under the notice of Allahabad.\n\nFa Hian, the Chinese Buddhist traveller who visited India from 399 to 413 A.D., does not mention any place between Muttra and Taxila. Hwen Thsang, however, in 634 A.D., passed through Sth\u00e1n\u00e9svara (Thanesar) on his way from Muttra to Srughna, and may have passed close to Delhi if proceeding by the direct road along the Jumna or by Meerut, which, owing to its being a station of one of Asoka's pillars, must have been of some interest to a Buddhist. Neither of these places are noticed by him, a fact which would, at all events, show their small importance in the middle of the seventh century. At the time of his visit to Thanesar, that city was the capital of a kingdom tributary to Harsha Vardhana of Kanauj, bounded on the north by the principality of Srughna; on the east by the Ganges, which separated it from Mand\u00e1war in the Bijnor District; on the west by the Satlaj river; and on the south by an irregular line drawn from near P\u00e1kpatan on the Satlaj, by Bhatner and N\u00e1rnoi to An\u00fapshahr on the Ganges. It therefore included the southern portion of the Muzaffarnagar District, the entire district of Meerut, and the northern half of Bulandshahr. At the time of his visit, Hwen Thsang found only three Buddhist monasteries in Thanesar, while the Brahmanical temples numbered one hundred.\n\nHwen Thsang proceeded from Thanesar by the Gokantha monastery to Srughna, the capital of the kingdom of the same name, which was bounded on the north by the mountains; on the east by the Ganges; on the south by an irregular line passing through Muzaffarnagar; while the Jumna flowed through the middle of it. The capital has been identified by General Cunningham with the village of Sugh, situated in a bend of the old bed of the Jumna, which surrounds it on three sides, on the old road from Jag\u00e1dri to Sah\u00e1ranpur, close to a bungalow belonging to the Western Jumna Canal. This agrees with the pilgrim's account, who places it on the west bank of the Jumna. The greater part was then in ruins, but the foundations still remained, and showed the circumference of the city to have been something more than three miles. It possessed fine monasteries, containing one thousand monks, and one hundred Brahmanical temples, besides numerous stupas or topes containing relics of Buddha and other holy men. The site would appear to have been known as Mandal, from the adjoining village of Mandalpur, as early as the reign of F\u00edr\u00faz Tughlak.\n\n---\n\n1 Translated by the Rev. S. Beal: Lond., 1869.  \n2 See Cunningham's An. Geog., 329; Arch. Rep. II., 221.  \n3 Arch. Rep. II., 226.\nIn 1834, Captain Cautley communicated the discovery of an old town while clearing out the canal bed south of the Bolka falls, near Bahat or Behat, in the Saharanpur District. The site was found to be seventeen feet below the general surface of the country, and twenty-five feet below that of the modern town near it. Coins and other remains were discovered in the shingle laid bare by the action of the canal water. The coins were numerous, and some of them were of Indo-Scythic origin, containing inscriptions in Arian or Bactro-Pali, of Semitic origin, also transliterated into Indian Pali of a type little subsequent to the characters on Asoka's pillars. The remains, on the whole, stamp the place as decidedly Buddhist, but \"it would be hazardous to attribute to them any greater antiquity than the early part of the Christian era.\" The discovery is further useful in showing the existence of towns boasting a considerable degree of civilization at this early period, in what may be called the wilder parts of the Upper Doab. The soil on the site contained numerous specimens of pottery; bricks of a large size and an unusual shape appearing as if they had been made to suit the circular form of wells; pieces of the slag of iron, smelting furnaces, arrow-heads, ornaments and beads. The extent of the deposit, too, would seem to denote a town of considerable extent; and without accepting Bahat either as the centre or positive capital of the kingdom for whose currency the coins discovered there \"were designed to provide, its boundaries might be conjectured as extending down the Doab below Hastinapur, and westward beyond the latter river to some distance along the foot of the Himalayas into the Panjab.\"\n\nReturning to the chronicles of Delhi, we find it universally acknowledged by all authorities that Delhi owes its re-existence as a capital city to Anang Pali, the first prince of the Tomar dynasty. This event took place, according to tradition, in 736 A.D., and, on independent evidence, General Cunningham considers this date \"as\n\n---\n\n1 J. A. S., Ben., (Jan. 1834); Prinsep's Ess. Vol. I., 73, 78, 112, 200.  \n2 Mr. Thomas, Prinsep's Ess. I., 204.  \n3 Chand Bardai, the celebrated bard, recounts the founding of Delhi by Anang Pali, who, guided by a happy omen, struck an iron column so deeply into the ground that its point entered the head of Seshnag, the king of the Nagas or Indo-Scythians. Upon the stability of this pillar was to rest the fortunes of the Tomar dynasty; yet, deceived by Takshak, the brother of Seshnag, Anang Pali was weak enough to allow it to be moved. Anang Pali then sought counsel of the sage Vyasa, who related to him the fortunes of his house. (J. A. S., Ben., XXXVII., 119; XXXVIII., 1, 145, 161). May not this legend have a foundation in fact, that the Indo-Scythian rulers of the north had still considerable influence so far south as Delhi, and were able to impede the colonizing projects of the Tomar prince. Kumason traditions place the Kasyuras about this period, whose connection with the Katos of Chitral and the Indo-Scythian princes of Kabul will be noticed in the volume devoted to the Hill Districts. I will only remark here that it is a curious coincidence that Vasudeva, the successor of Kanishka and Huvishka, the Indo-Scythian rulers of Kashmir, bears the same name as the eponymous founder of the Kasyura line in Kumason, known there as Badeo.\nbeing established on grounds that are more than usually firm for early Indian history.\" It is probable also that shortly afterwards the Tomars transferred their capital to Kanauj, which, owing to the pressure of the Musalm\u00e1ns, they abandoned for B\u00e2ri in Oudh (1021 to 1051 A.D.); and subsequently, under Anang P\u00e1l the Second, returned to Dehli in 1052 A.D., where he built L\u00e1lkot or the red fort near the Kutb Min\u00e1r. Tradition ascribes the building of T\u00e1ragarh near Ajmer, Indragarh, Tejora between G\u00fargaon and Alwar, Achhnera between Bharatpur (Bhurtpoor) and Agra, and Sirsa, to the sons of Anang P\u00e1l, which would show that his dominions extended from H\u00e1n\u00ee on the north to Agra on the south, and from Ajmer on the west to the Ganges on the east,\u2014the entire tract beyond the Ganges being at this time held by the Katehriya Rajp\u00fbts. Anang P\u00e1l II. was succeeded by three other princes of the same family, the last of whom, Anang P\u00e1l III., was conquered by the Chauh\u00e1n Prince, Bisal De or Visala Deva.\n\nThe conquest of Dehli by the Chauh\u00e1ns under Visala Deva took place about 1151 A.D. The Fir\u00fbz Shah pillar, or golden l\u00e1t, already mentioned as containing the edicts of Asoka, has an inscription of this prince, which has been translated by Mr. Colebrooke.\u00b9 This was written in 1164 A.D., to commemorate the fortunate Visala Deva, the son of Vella Deva, R\u00e2ja of S\u00e1kambhari, who had reduced under his sway the entire country from the Vindhya to the Him\u00e2dri. In this inscription he urges on his descendants not to permit their \"minds to be void of exertion to subdue the remainder.\" The conqueror appears, however, to have left Anang P\u00e1l in possession of a portion of the Dehli territory. Someswara, son of Visala, received in marriage the daughter of Anang P\u00e1l. The issue of this union was the famous Prithivi of Prithir\u00e2j, also known as Rai Pithaura.\n\nPrithir\u00e2j was adopted by Anang P\u00e1l in 1169 A.D., and succeeded him in the following year as king of Dehli, where he reigned for 22 years. For his history we have fortunately the voluminous poem by Chand, known as the Prithvi R\u00e2j R\u00e2esa already alluded to. It is divided into several books. Mr. Beames has translated a portion relating to the seizure of Padm\u00e2vati in the fort of Samud Sikhar by Prithir\u00e2j, and the fight between him and Shib\u00e2b-ud-din, and the entire work is now being printed. The Chandel-Chauh\u00e1n war has been mentioned under the notice of Mahoba,\u00b2 and the chapter on Kanauj will be found under Kanauj. Dehli was captured by the Musalm\u00e1ns in 1193 A.D., and with this date commences the Musalm\u00e1n occupation of Eastern India; and as it is not my purpose to trespass upon the work so well done by Elphinstone and others, this sketch of the early history of the districts of the Upper Du\u00e1b will close here where the Musalm\u00e1n historian Firishta and his editors commence their histories. I will merely add\n\n\u00b9 Prinsep's Essays by Thomas I., 325; As. Res., VIII., 130.\n\u00b2 Gazetteer, I., 526.\nwhat I have been able to glean from local traditions, and leave the general history up to the eighteenth century to be gathered from the pages of Elphinstone and Elliot.\n\nConnected with the Muhammadan invasion of India, there is no one of whom more wild legends are recorded than Sip\u00e2h S\u00e2l\u00eer Mas\u00e2ud, the prince of martyrs. He is the popular hero of the Musalm\u00e2n romances, occupying in them the position of the P\u00e2ndava Arjuna in the Hindu poems. S\u00e2l\u00eer Mas\u00e2ud was the son of S\u00e2l\u00eer S\u00e2hu, brother of Mahm\u00fbd, and was born in Ajmer* in 1014 A.D., while his father was living there. When he was only twelve years of age he led an expedition against Raw\u00e2l, in which he was successful. Throughout his life he acted on the principle that \"no faith should be kept with unbelievers.\" When Mahm\u00fbd permitted the ransom of the idol of Somn\u00e2th, though the money was paid by the Hind\u00fbs, the youthful fanatic persuaded Mahm\u00fbd to break his word, and broke the idol into pieces. To such a degree was his influence felt, that several of the old servants of Mahm\u00fbd retired from the court in disgust, so that Mahm\u00fbd was reluctantly obliged to exile his favourite by sending him on an expedition to Hindustan. Mas\u00e2ud's force captured Mult\u00e2n, where he remained during the rains, and then advanced to Ajudhiya. Delighted with the climate and the sport, he remained there until the end of the following rains, and then proceeded to Dehli. Here he was reduced to great straits in his contest with R\u00e9ja Mah\u00eep\u00e2l, but was relieved by the unexpected arrival of reinforcements from Ghazni, by whose aid he entirely defeated the Hind\u00fbs. Leaving a garrison in Dehli, S\u00e2l\u00eer Mas\u00e2ud proceeded to Meerut, where the princes of that place acknowledged his supremacy, and received again their possessions as tributaries of the Musalm\u00e2ns. Rai Aj\u00eep\u00e2l of Kanauj in the same manner is said to have done homage to the Musalm\u00e2n leader. From Kanauj he made a ten days' march to Satrakh,* which is described as lying in the centre of India; \"it had, moreover, good hunting grounds, and was a sacred shrine of the Hind\u00fbs.\" Hence he made expeditions to Benares, Muttra and Gopamau, and eventually 'suffered martyrdom' at the hands of the Hind\u00fbs at Bahr\u00e2ich in 1033 A.D. Within the next three centuries the tomb of this warrior had become a place of pilgrimage, as we read of Sultan Muhammad-bin-Tughlik proceeding to Bahr\u00e2ich to make offerings at the shrine in 1343 A.D., so that there may be some foundation in fact for the popular legends regarding this pioneer of Muhammadan conquest in Eastern India.\n\n---\n\n1 It may well be doubted whether he ever existed, or, if so much must be conceded, whether his exploits are founded on historical facts. In the Mir-at-t Mur\u00e2d\u00ee, which gives an account of his life, facts and fiction are strangely combined, and the great actions of other men are unscrupulously appropriated to the hero of the tale (Dowson's Elliot, II., 514). 2 Sunday, 21st Sh\u00e2b\u00e2n, 405 A.H. 3 Identified by General Cunningham with Bes\u00e2kh, a name of S\u00e2het or Ajudhiya.\nSome further information regarding the distribution of power amongst the Hindu inhabitants of the Upper Do\u00e1b during the Musalm\u00e1n occupation may be gathered from local traditions.\n\nIn the three upper districts of the Du\u00e1b, Pandirs, Gautams, Gours, Gahlots and Tagas were amongst the earliest inhabitants; subsequently, large immigrations of Jats and Gujars took place from the west. The Tagas received their lands for the aid rendered by them to R\u00e1ja Janamejaya in his great snake sacrifice. Here again we have local confirmation of the contests between the Aryan colonists and the Indo-Scythic tribes. R\u00e1ja Ahibaran (the snake coloured) founded Baran in the Bulandshahr District. His dynasty was succeeded by that of the Dors, who, under their leader Hardatta, occupied the Du\u00e1b from Kol to Meerut, where he constructed forts to guard the boundaries of his territory. The Dors were followed by the Mewatis, and they again by the Bargujars in the southern districts, and these latter now form the characteristic element amongst the Rajp\u00fat population of Bulandshahr. The Dors fell with the advent of the Musalm\u00e1ns and the pressure of immigrant races from the west. In the Aligarh District they have been replaced by Chauh\u00e1ns, Pandirs, J\u00e1dons and Porachs. It would be useless repetition to give any further details here, as they belong properly to the local history of each district.\n\nFrom the Jesuit traveller Tiefenthaler we learn that in the middle of the eighteenth century, the S\u00fabah of Dehli contained the Sirk\u00e1rs of Debli, Budaon, Sambhal, Kumaon, Sah\u00e1r\u00e1npur, Rewari, Sarhind and Hissar Firoza. In the Sirk\u00e1r of Dehli were Baran with a brick fortress, Bhagpath (B\u00e1gpat) situated between two rivers, Barnauva (Barn\u00e1wa), Pouth (P\u00fath), Dancor (Dankaur), Schacarpour (Shik\u00e1rpur), T\u00e1nda Bh\u00e1gban (T\u00e1nda), Tilbegampour (Tilbegampur), Zaharsa (Jharcha) with a brick fort, Djavar (Jewar), Zazhana (Jhanjh\u00e1na), Djalalabad (J\u00e1lalabad) lying between two rivers, Djalalpour Serot (J\u00e1l\u00e1pur Sarwat) between two rivers, Dasna (D\u00e1sna), Dadaritaha (D\u00e9dri), Sikandarabad, Sar\u00e1va (S\u00e1rava) with a brick fort, Gharmuctessor (Garhmuktesar) with a fort built of bricks, Cot\u00e1na (Kut\u00e1na), C\u00e1ndela (K\u00e1ndela), Cassna (K\u00e1sna), Karkh\u00e1d (Karkh\u00f3da), Kikar Khera (Kankar khera), Louni (Loni) with a brick fort, Merath (Meerut) with a fort constructed of the same material, Haschtnapour (Has-tin\u00e1pur), and Hapour (H\u00e1pur). In the list under Sirk\u00e1r Sah\u00e1r\u00e1npur, the names of the parganahs are alone given, and these are identified in the district notice. Passing from the country to the people, I shall now give a sketch of the history of the Upper Du\u00e1b during the decline and fall of the Mughal Empire, and will thus show the predisposing influences which led to the intrusion of a foreign power into the heart of India, as well as give the general history necessary to understand the local annals of each district.\nThe decline of the Mughal Empire may be said to commence from the death of Aurangzeb, for, though the seeds of dissolution were sown during his reign, the plants had not yet appeared, and the fruit was not gathered for some half a century afterwards. It was during this period that the British merchants commenced the formation of their settlements in Bengal; the Persian trader, Saadat Khan, founded the hereditary vazirship of Oudh; the Sayyids of B\u00e1rha in the Muzaffarnagar District came into prominent notice; the Bangash family obtained possession of Farukhabad; the Marhattas of the Dakhin began to interfere in the affairs of Hindustan; and the Rohillas and other adventurers flourished and fell. Aurangzeb died at Ahmadnagar in February, 1707, without making any provision for a successor; and, perhaps animated by his example, his sons at once commenced to fight amongst themselves for the possession of the throne. Their names and those of their descendants are given below:\n\n**AURANGZEB (died 1707).**\n\n| Muhammad Asam (killed at Agra, 1707) | Kambaksh (killed at Haiderabad, 1709) | Musam or Baidatur Shah (died at Lahore, 1713) | Akbar |\n|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------|\n| Ali Tabar Bedar Walaiah (murdered, Bakht (killed at Agra, 1707) | Nikhita Akhtar or Akbar (killed at Lahore, 1712) | Rad-ud-din (died in prison), Rad-ud-danish (died, 1730) | daughter.

Briggs: London, O. T. F. 1832; and two volumes by a French renegade named Mustafa; Tar\u00eekh-i-Muafari; Ahmad-ud-Saadat; Shah Alamzamah, a work by S.

F. Smith's Sketch of the Rise of the Regular Corps, commanded by European Officers, in the service of Native Princes: Calcutta, circa 1801.\nMuhammad Azam, who was nearest to the Emperor's camp, took possession of the treasure and marched upon Agra. He was, however, anticipated by Azim-us-shan, the son of Prince Muazam, who invested the city on his father's behalf during the absence of the latter in Kabul. Muazam by forced marches joined his son, and the rival armies met on the plain of Ajaju close to Agra, where a desperate battle was fought on the last day of May, 1707, in which Prince Azam and his sons Bedar Bakht and Walajah, were slain, and Muazam assumed the imperial power with the title of Bahadur Shah. Kambaksh, who set up for himself in the Dakhin, fell in the battle of Haidarabad in 1709, and with him ended all opposition to the new Emperor. Bahadur Shah was not slow to reward those who had exerted themselves in his cause. The battle of Agra was won, in a great measure, by the energy displayed by a contingent of Barha Sayyids from the Muzaffarnagar District, who had taken service with Azim-us-shan in Bengal; and when the latter was confirmed in his government, he made S. Abdullah Khan, one of the principal Sayyid leaders, his deputy at Allahabad, while S. Husain Ali, a younger brother, was made vice-governor of Patna. These men were sons of S. Abdullah Khan, so much renowned in Ajmer under the name of Miyan Khan.\n\nBahadur Shah died at Lahore in 1712 A.D. For a few days Azim-us-shan attempted to retain in his own hand the considerable power he exercised during his father's life-time, but perished in the attempt. Again, Khajista Akhtar, with the title of Jahangir Shah, reigned for a few days, but both he and his brother, Rafi-ul-Kadr, were slain by the adherents of their brother Muiz-ud-din, who eventually succeeded to the throne with the title of Jahandar Shah. His first care was to remove all possible competitors for the throne out of his way, and for this purpose he put to death the children of Prince Azam and Prince Kambaksh, and demanded the person of Farrukhsiyar, the youngest son of Azim-us-shan, from S. Husain Ali, then at Patna. The Sayyid, who owed so much to the father, was reluctant to obey the order; and learning the state of affairs at court, where Jahandar Shah was alienating all his supporters by the cruelty of his acts and the devotion that he showed to his Hindu mistress Lal Kuar, Husain Ali resolved to make one bold attempt at power for himself and the family of his former benefactor. He levied a large force in, Bengal and communicated his designs to his brother at Allahabad. The latter at first attempted to dissuade his brother from such a rash undertaking, but seeing that Husain Ali was resolved to persevere, at length threw his whole energy into the conspiracy. S. Abdullah intercepted the revenues of Bengal as they passed through Allahabad to Delhi, and thus supplied with the sinews of war, equipped a considerable force, and converted the artillery of the fort into a powerful field battery.\nIn the meantime, Jah\u00e1nd\u00e1r Shah despatched an army of twelve thousand cavalry, with a complement of artillery, to attack the Sayyid forces at Allahabad before they could be joined by the Bengal rebels. Abdullah knowing his own weakness shut himself up in the fort of Allahabad with one half of his force, whilst he sent the remainder under his younger brothers to harass and distress the enemy, and thus give time for the arrival of reinforcements. The imperial army contrived to elude their opponents, and invested the fort, but had hardly begun their preparations for the assault when they were attacked in the rear by the D\u00fa\u00e1b flying columns, whilst a sally was made from the fort, which ended in their total rout. Alarmed at this victory, Jah\u00e1nd\u00e1r Shah tried to detach Abdullah from the service of Farrukhsiy\u00e1r; but, unfortunately for the success of this movement, the young prince had already arrived at Allahabad with S. Husain Ali and a numerous following, including some of the most distinguished generals of his father. Jah\u00e1nd\u00e1r Shah then despatched his son, Aiz-ud-d\u00edn, with another army, to oppose the progress of the Sayyids. Aiz-ud-d\u00edn advanced as far as Kadjuwa on the Ganges; but although he possessed a vastly superior force, he did not consider himself a match for the enemy, and on their first attack, abandoned his camp and baggage into their hands. Early in November the Emperor advanced in person towards Agra, and met the Sayyid forces close to the city, where he was totally defeated, and fled to Dehli. On the accession of Farrukhsiy\u00e1r to the throne, S. Abdullah was honoured with the title of Kuth-ul-Mulk, and received the command of 7,000 horse, with the office of Vaz\u00edr, whilst his brother, S. Husain Ali, was named Ihtimam-ul-Mulk, and was given a similar command, with the offices of Am\u00edr-ul-Umara and Commander-in-Chief. S. Husain Ali, after some successes in Udepur, received the viceroyalty of the Dakhin, whilst his brother remained at Dehli to watch over their mutual interests.\n\nThe Sayyids, anxious to strengthen their faction, obtained for their master the hand of a Hindu princess, and it was for his services in enabling Farrukhsiy\u00e1r to consummate this marriage that Gabriel Hamilton, a physician in the employ of the English settlement on the H\u00fagli, procured a grant of the 24-parganahs for his employers. The Sayyids became all powerful, but quarrels soon arose at court, and a coalition was formed against them, in which the Emperor joined, forgetful of their services and jealous of their power. When this become known, the younger brother came from the Dakhin; and, uniting their forces, the Sayyids deposed Jah\u00e1nd\u00e1r Shah (1720 A.D.) and raised Rafi-ud-darajat, the son of Rafi-ul-Kadr, to the throne. Rafi-\u00fad-darajat died after a short reign of three months, and was succeeded by his brother Rafi-ud-daulah, who also died within the year. The Sayyids then raised to the throne Prince Roshan Akhtar, with the\ntitle of Muhammad Shah. He soon gave signs of a vigour which, had it been foreseen, would assuredly have consigned him for ever to the obscurity from which he had been raised.\n\nIntriguing with Niz\u00e1m-ul-mulk, Muhammad Amir Khan and others, he tacitly approved of the removal of the Sayyids. Husain Ali Khan was assassinated in the Emperor's camp in the year 1720 A.D., while his personal troops were defeated and scattered. On hearing of these events, Abdullah raised a brother of Rafi-ud-daulah to the throne, under the title of Sult\u00e1n Ibrahim, and exerted his utmost vigour to collect an army and supplies from all quarters. In the meantime the old landholders of the Upper Du\u00e1b, whose villages he had seized, rose on all sides and expelled his agents; and finding there was no one to oppose them or restore order, the G\u00fajars and J\u00e1ts fought amongst themselves and plundered their neighbours. By the lavish expenditure of money, Abdullah was able in a fortnight to march against Muhammad Shah, and being joined on his way by Chur\u00e1man, the leader of the J\u00e1t colony who settled in the Agra sibah in the reign of Aurangzeb, he gave battle to the imperial forces near Hasanpur, between Agra and Delhi, on the 20th October, 1721. The Sayyid forces were here completely routed. Abdullah was taken prisoner, and died by poison three years afterwards, and with him ended the power of this remarkable family.\n\nBeyond the rise of the J\u00e1ts, who murdered the Deputy-Governor of Agra, and the intrigues of the now independent Viceroy of the Dakhin with the Marhattas, there are few events of local importance to detain us during the remainder of Muhammad Shah's reign. The Marhattas took part as mercenaries in the wars between the more powerful nobles, and acquired such influence, that Niz\u00e1m-ul-mulk conceived it to be of advantage to him to employ them against the provinces that remained faithful to the Emperor. They invaded M\u00e1lwa and expelled the imperial governor; and advancing thence by Bundelkhand (see BUNDELKHAND, Gazetteer, Volume I.), they threatened Allahabad, and routed the governor, Muhammad Khan Bangash, in several encounters. Emboldened by their successes, and finding the plan hitherto pursued by their enemies, of purchasing their forbearance, attended with little danger and much profit, the Marhattas in 1732 extended their ravages as far as Agra; and in the two following years so harassed the Du\u00e1b, that the Emperor bribed them with the gift of M\u00e1lwa and Gujar\u00e1t, territories they had conquered with the sword and still held in their grasp. Sadat Khan's slight success near Sada-bad, in the Muttra District, served for a time to stem the tide of Marhatta invasion; but not until the Marhattas had an opportunity of sacking the environs of the capital itself. Notwithstanding the necessity that existed for union, the councils of the Emperor were distracted by the private\nquarrels of his nobles, and, in consequence, Kumr-ud-din Khan, the Vazir, was permitted to wreak his long-cherished vengeance on the Sayyids of B\u00e1rha by sacking J\u00e1nasath in 1737, with the aid of the Rohillas.\n\nThe next important event is the sack of Dehli and the surrounding villages by N\u00e1dir Shah in 1738, and the general massacre and plunder of the inhabitants. On the departure of the Persians, the state of society in the Upper Du\u00e1b was merely a reflection of the anarchy and confusion existing at Dehli. The army was disorganised, the treasury was empty, and the only districts spared by the Marhattas were now visited with fire and sword by the Persians. The Marhattas on the south, the J\u00e1ts, Sikhs, and wandering Afghan bands on the west, and the Rohillas on the east, all agreed in considering the Du\u00e1b an enemy's country,\u2014a fit object for spoliation. The death of the Marhatta leader, B\u00e1ji Rao, in 1740, promised for a time to relieve the empire from those troublesome invaders, but B\u00e1liji Rao had scarcely secured his position as B\u00e1ji Rao's successor than he applied himself to the affairs of Hindust\u00e1n. He began at once to organise an expedition against the Du\u00e1b, from which he was only prevented by an insurrection in his rear. M\u00e1lwa was again granted as a sop to the Marhattas, whilst Niz\u00e1m-ul-mulk became absolutely independent in the Dakhin, with his son, Gh\u00e1zi-ud-d\u00edn, now son-in-law of the Vazir, holding the chief power at Dehli. The Rohillas, too, under Ali Muhammad threw off all pretence at allegiance; and, to crown all, Dehli was again attacked from the north by Ahmad, the leader of the Abd\u00e1li or Dur\u00e1n\u00ed tribe of Afgh\u00e1ns, who was, however, obliged to retire. Muhammad Shah died in 1748, and was succeeded by his son, Ahmad Shah.\n\nAhmad Shah made Gh\u00e1zi-ud-d\u00edn Khan Commander-in-Chief, and Abul Mansur Safdar Jang, the Governor of Oudh, his Vazir, and calling in the J\u00e1ts and Marhattas, and a large contingent under K\u00e1yam Khan Bangash of Fa-\n\nAhmad Shah, 1748\u20141754 A.D.\n\nHe was succeeded in his high office by his nephew, Shah\u00e1b-ud-d\u00edn, son of Firoz Jang, the fourth son of the Niz\u00e1m. Shah\u00e1b-ud-d\u00edn, on his uncle's death, assumed the name of Gh\u00e1zi-ud-d\u00edn and the title Aamad-ul-mulk, and commenced the quarrel with Safdar Jang which ended in the latter being deprived of the office of Vazir, which was conferred upon Az\u00edz-ud-d\u00edn, son of the late Kumr-ud-d\u00edn, and uncle by the mother's side of Gh\u00e1zi-ud-d\u00edn. He is, however, better known by the name Intiz\u00e1m-ud-daulah Khan Kh\u00e1n\u00e1n. Gh\u00e1zi-ud-d\u00edn shortly afterwards proceeded by Agra and Muttra, and attacked the J\u00e1ts of Bhartpur who had befriended Safdar Jang in his distress. The Emperor and his Vazir conceiving this to be a good opportunity for ridding themselves of their over-active and overbearing Commander-in-Chief, intrigued with the J\u00e1ts; but their treachery being discovered, Gh\u00e1zi-ud-d\u00edn marched upon Dehli, seized and blinded.\nthe Emperor, and raised Prince Aziz-ud-din, son of Muiz-ud-din and grandson of Bahadur Shah, to the throne, under the title of Alamgir II. This happened in the month of July, 1754.\n\nSafdar Jang died soon afterwards, and was succeeded by his son, Shujah-ud-daulah. In 1756, Ahmad Shah Abdali again invaded Hindustan and sacked Alamgir II. 1754\u201359 Delhi. He removed Ghazi-ud-din from the vizirat, and appointed the young prince, Ali Gauhar, to succeed him.\n\nAt the same time he marched against the Jats; where Ghazi-ud-din so distinguished himself that the Abdalis restored him to the vizirat before his departure. The sack of Muttra and the plunder of Agra are the two most noteworthy events connected with this year's history of these provinces. Ghazi-ud-din, on the departure of the Afghans, became once more supreme at Delhi, and Najib Khan was ousted from his appointment of Commander-in-Chief, which was conferred upon Ahmad Khan Bangash of Farukhabad. Several attempts were now made to unite the Rohillas, the Oudh chief, and the Jats in a league against the Vazir, for the purpose of redressing the cause of Ali Gauhar and freeing the Emperor from the tyranny of Ghazi-ud-din; but the dread of the Marhatta allies of the Vazir obliged them to decline engaging in such a dangerous enterprise. Ali Gauhar fled to Lucknow, and the Marhattas invaded the Doab, driving Najib Khan to take refuge in his fort at Shukartar, near the confluence of the Sola and the Ganges, and eventually overran the whole of Rohilkhand. Alarmed at these successes, Shujah-ud-daulah joined with the Rohillas in repelling the Marhattas, and defeated them at the fords of the Ganges. During this time Ali Gauhar had proceeded to Ali Gauhar in Bengal, with the intention of driving out Jafar Ali Khan, who had been raised to power by the British, and establishing himself there. He crossed the Karnanasa in 1759 A.D., but, repulsed in his attacks upon Patna, retired to Allahabad, where he remained until intelligence of his father's death reached him. Ghazi-ud-din, on hearing of the repulse of his Marhatta allies and the approach of the Afghans, had caused the Emperor to be assassinated. The Abdalis in the mean time surprised and cut to pieces one half the Marhatta army under Dattaji, and utterly dispersed the remainder under Malhar Rao Holkar, after which they retired to Anupshahr, where they encamped for the remainder of the year. Both sides now prepared to contest the sovereignty of Hindustan. Ali Gauhar was written to and installed as Emperor, under the title of Shah Alam. The vizirat was conferred upon Shujah-ud-daulah, and the Rohillas and Najib Khan were urged to assist the great Musalm\u00e2n confederacy. On the other hand, the Hindus and their allies were not idle: Ghazi-ud-din roused the Jats of Bharatpur, and the entire resources of the Marhatta nation were placed at the disposal of Sadashoo Bhau as Commander-in-Chief. Before the close of the rains the\nMarhattas had not only occupied Delhi, but had driven in the Afghan outposts along the Jumna, and between it and the hills, destroying the entire garrison of Kunjpura and other fortified towns. This success was shortlived, for when the rains ceased, Ahmad Shah crossed the Jumna, and, on the 6th January, 1761, completely routed the Marhattas at Panipat, where two hundred thousand of the enemy are said to have perished. The Marhattas retired from Hindustan, Najib Khan was made Amir-ul-Umara, Shujah-ud-daulah continued as Vazir, and Prince Mirza Jawan Bakht represented his father at Delhi.\n\nWe left Shah Alam at Allahabad in 1759, where he had retired after his first unsuccessful attempt upon Bengal. Collecting another army in the following year, he again invaded Bengal, and though worsted in two engagements, laid siege to Patna. In this attack he was assisted by a party of French under the Chevalier Law. The siege was raised by the efforts of Captain Knox, and all subsequent attempts were repulsed. Shah Alam again took the field in 1761, but met with no better success, and at length agreed to a compromise by which he received the province of Allahabad and Korah, and an annual subsidy of \u00a3260,000 a year from the revenues of Bengal. In return for this the Diwani of Bengal, Behar and Orissa was conferred on the English. Shah Alam fixed his residence at Allahabad, but here fell into the hands of Shujah-ud-daulah, Nawab of Oudh, who kept him for two years in a sort of honourable confinement, sometimes at Lucknow, sometimes at Allahabad, and sometimes at Benares. The Nawab, under the name of the Emperor, again attacked the British in 1765 at the Karmasa, where he was utterly routed, and further negotiations were entered into, which can be more correctly detailed with the history of the Benares Province.\n\nEnough has been said by way of introduction to connect the general history of the Upper Doab in the first half of the last century with the local history of the latter half, which alone is the object of the remainder of this notice. The portions of the Upper Doab comprising the present districts of Saharanpur, Muzaffarnagar, Meerut and the northern parganas of Bulandsahar, were known as the Bawani or Baoni Mahal, from its containing 52 (bawans) parganas or fiscal sub-divisions. This tract, in the middle of the last century, formed the jagir of Intizam-ud-daula Khan Khana, the minister of Ahmad Shah. When Ghazi-ud-din resolved to depose Ahmad Shah, he despatched Najib Khan, who had already distinguished himself as a partisan leader in Rohilkhand, with a body of Mughal troops to occupy the country about Saharanpur. Najib Khan was an Afghan of the Kumrkhel tribe, who had in his early youth come from the mountains of Kandahar to seek his fortunes under his uncle Bishirath Khan. With him he entered the service of Ali Muhammed, of the tribe of Roh, who was then\nsettled in Katehir, and received, in reward for his services, a small j\u0101g\u012br in the north-west of Rohilkhand, in the district now known as Bijnor. Here he became independent, and received the daughter of D\u00fcndi Kh\u00e1n, another Rohilla leader, in marriage. On the outbreak of the quarrel between Safdar Jang and the Emperor, when the former called upon H\u00e1fiz Rahmat Khan, the Rohilla leader, to fulfil the terms of an offensive and defensive alliance that had been agreed upon between them, and the latter conceived it to be his duty to simply withdraw his forces, the Emperor's agents offered large sums of money to induce the Rohilla Sard\u0101rs to enter his service. Najib Kh\u00e1n, who then commanded one hundred horse, was the only one who accepted the bribe; but when the private soldiers saw that large rewards were bestowed on those who adopted the Emperor's cause, they flocked to the standard of Najib, who soon found himself in command of two thousand men. In the battle of Kotila (or Kohtala), which shortly afterwards took place, Najib Kh\u00e1n behaved with great gallantry, and slew with his own hand Indargir Gosh\u00e1in, the leader of Safdar Jang's forces. In reward for this exploit, he received Sah\u00e1ranpur, B\u00farh\u00e1na, and all the villages of the Sayyids of B\u00e1rh\u00e1, in j\u0101g\u012br. It was on this account that Gh\u00e1zi-ud-d\u00edn chose Najib to represent him in the Du\u00e1b; and to still further attach him to his interests, promised him the remainder of the districts bordering on his j\u0101g\u012br, then held by Intiz\u00e1m-ud-daulah.\n\nNajib Khan, after the downfall of Ahmad Sh\u00e1h, repaired to the court of the new Emperor, and so ingratiated himself with those in power, that when Ahmad Shah Abd\u00e1li invaded Dehl\u00ed and permitted Alamgr\u00edr to choose his own ministers, Najib Khan was made Bakshi of the empire, with the duty of collecting the revenues. It is said that Najib Khan, on taking possession of his new office, expelled the females of Gh\u00e1zi-ud-d\u00edn's household from their home; and this act so enraged the Vaz\u00edr that, on the departure of Ahmad Shah, he invited the Marhatta leaders Raghun\u00e1th Rao and Malhar Rao Holk\u00e1r from the Dakhin, and joining them with his own forces from Farukhabad, attacked the royal army. For five and twenty days repeated actions took place, the result of which was that Najib Khan was confirmed in his j\u0101g\u012br, whilst Gh\u00e1zi-ud-d\u00edn remained at Dehl\u00ed. This was a hollow truce, and each of the combatants eagerly waited for an opportunity to crush the other. It was to Sikandarabad, then in the possession of Najib Khan, that the Prince Ali Gauhar, afterwards known as the Emperor Shah Alam, fled when he escaped from the hands\n\n---\n\n1 This act of Najib Kh\u00e1n led to a misunderstanding between D\u00fcndi Kh\u00e1n and H\u00e1fiz Rahmat Kh\u00e1n, which nearly broke out into open war. The latter accused the former of conniving at Najib Khan's practical contravention of the terms of the treaty made between Safdar Jang and the Rohillas, and led a force against Bisauil, a j\u0101g\u012br belonging to D\u00fcndi Kh\u00e1n; but friends intervening, it was shown that D\u00fcndi Kh\u00e1n, though father-in-law, was not to be held responsible for Najib Kh\u00e1n's acts.\nof Gh\u00e1zi-ud-din. Najib Khan allotted the young prince a monthly income of \u00a35,000 for his expenses, and treated him with every respect, and endeavoured in every way to induce the Rohillas and others to assist him. Hearing of these intrigues, Gh\u00e1zi-ud-din again called in the Marhattas to assist him in destroying his hated rival and rescuing the j\u00e1gir; and these formidable allies, under Jan-k\u00f3ji and D\u00e1t\u00e1j\u00ed, arrived at Dehli in 1759. Najib Khan entrenched himself on the Ganges at Shukart\u00e1r, and, in his turn, solicited aid from the Rohillas and the Viceroy of Oudh, whose combined forces marched from Bareilly in November, 1759, and, on reaching Hasanpur, heard that the Marhattas had made preparations for crossing the river. Bakshi Sard\u00e1r Khan was at once despatched to oppose them, and others were directed to follow. On his arrival at Sabalgarh the Bakshi found that a large body of the enemy had already crossed, and throwing himself into a fort, awaited the arrival of the reinforcements. On their approach the enemy retreated; and, hearing of the advance of Ahmad Shah from K\u00e1b\u00fal, consented to execute a treaty of peace, which was of no long continuance. Ahmad Sh\u00e1h, marching along the foot of the hills, crossed the Jumna opposite Saharanpur and entered the Du\u00e1b, where he was joined by Najib Khan and the other Rohilla chiefs, and, crossing the Jumna at B\u00e1gp\u00e1t, defeated the Marhattas and proceeded to Dehli. Najib Khan was again appointed Bakshi of the Empire and guardian of the Prince Mirza Jawan Bakht, who then represented Sh\u00e1h Alam at Dehli. We next hear of Najib Khan intriguing with Sh\u00faja-ud-daulah against the Afgh\u00e1ns of Farukhabad; and again, in 1746, defending the Du\u00e1b against the Bhartpur J\u00e1tas, who had advanced as far as Tappal.\n\nThe J\u00e1tas in the Du\u00e1b in possession of these districts, but had been expelled by Ahmad Sh\u00e1h, who parcelled out the Du\u00e1b amongst his Rohilla allies. The fief of Sikandra was conferred on Najib Khan, and thus his possessions became nearly conterminous with the present Meerut Division. The J\u00e1tas now sought to recover their authority in the Du\u00e1b; and in the campaign against them, Najib Khan, from the smallness of his force, thought it best to retire northwards. S\u00faraj Mal followed with a small force as far as Shahdara on the Hindan, in the Meerut District, where there was an old hunting seat of the Emperor, and the main body, under his son Jaw\u00e1hir, occupied Sikandra. Whilst enjoying the pleasures of the chase at Shahdara, S\u00faraj Mal and his party were surprised by a squadron of Mughal horse, who succeeded in killing the whole party, including their leader. The head of S\u00faraj Mal, displayed as a standard, struck such terror amongst the J\u00e1tas in the battle that followed, that they were thoroughly routed and driven back to their own country. Six months afterwards\n\n---\n\n1 The Siy\u00e1r-ni-Mutakheem states that the Marhattas crossed the Ganges, destroyed 1,300 villages, and obliged the Rohillas to fly to the hills of Kumaon.\nJaw\u00e1hir Mal renewed his attacks on Dehli with the aid of Malhar Rao Holk\u00e1r, and, surrounding the city, cut off all supplies of grain. Naj\u00edb-ud-daulah fortified the city as well as he could, called in his Du\u00e1b levies and his allies the Rohillas, and wrote to Ahmad Shah, at Kandah\u00e1r, for assistance. At the same time the Sikhs took advantage of Naj\u00edb's absence to invade Sah\u00e1ranpur; and as they even threatened the Rohilla country, the Rohilla leaders despatched at once a force of 6,000 horse to expel the Sikhs, and with the main body marched towards Dehli. Jaw\u00e1hir Mal and Malhar Rao, on hearing of the approach of the Rohillas on the one side and of Ahmad Shah on the other, at first redoubled their attacks on Naj\u00edb Khan's small force; but when the reinforcements approached nearer, Malhar Rao marched off to his own country, and the J\u00e1ts to Dig. Relieved from these enemies, Naj\u00edb Khan again devoted his attention towards organising an expedition against the Farukhabad Path\u00e1ns, and for this purpose invited a large Marhatta force under Madhoji Sindhia, T\u00fakaji Holkar, and Ramchandra Ganesh, to invade the Central Du\u00e1b. Z\u00e1bita Khan, the son of Naj\u00edb, was sent as his representative to the Marhatta camp; but before anything could be accomplished, Naj\u00edb Khan died at H\u00e1ipur in the Meerut District, and his remains were carried to Naj\u00edbabad, and deposited in a mausoleum erected to his memory.\n\nZ\u00e1bita Khan escaped from the Marhatta army and joined his father's forces, then encamped near Farukhabad, by whom he was received and acknowledged as chief, to the exclusion of his half brothers Maju and Kalu. The Farukhabad Path\u00e1ns now joined with the Marhattas, and induced Shah Alam to leave Allahabad and proceed to Dehli (December, 1771,) under their joint protection; and at the same time every effort was made to prevent Z\u00e1bita Khan from assuming the power and influence which his father had so long enjoyed. Faizullah Khan, Rohilla, whose sister had married Z\u00e1bita Khan, was employed to dissuade the latter from attempting to oppose the wishes of the Emperor and the Path\u00e1n-Marhatta confederacy; but disregarding advice and threats alike, Z\u00e1bita Khan proceeded towards Dehli, and encamped at Shukart\u00e1r. The royal army now approached, the Marhattas in the van and the imperial troops under Mirza Naj\u00ed Khan in the rear. Z\u00e1bita Khan drew out his forces a few miles in advance of his entrenchments and offered battle to the Emperor's troops. The combat was bloody, the Rohilla leaders, Sa\u00e1dat Khan and Sayyid Kh\u00e1n, behaved with great gallantry, but the former being killed by a cannon ball, his troops gave way, and the defeat of the entire Rohilla force was followed by the plunder of their artillery, baggage, stores and military chest. The Marhattas appropriated the spoil to their own use, and crossing the Ganges, captured Naj\u00edbabad and Naj\u00edfgarh, while the royal army marched\nupwards though the Du\u00e1b, and expelled all the Rohilla garrisons excepting Ghausgarh. The family of Z\u00e1bita Khan fell into the Emperor's hands, and amongst them his eldest son, named Ghul\u00e1m K\u00e1dir, who is said to have been transmuted into a haram page by the Emperor's order, and who lived to exact a fearful revenge for the injury done him. In the meantime, Z\u00e1bita Khan intrigued with the Marhattas, who agreed to restore him to his former dignities in consideration of his advancing them a large sum of money. The money having been paid, the Marhattas proceeded to Dehli, and after a bloody contest with the troops of the Emperor, took possession of the city. Z\u00e1bita Khan was pardoned and presented with a dress of honour, and was not only reinstated in his government at Sah\u00e1r\u00e1npur, but was officially confirmed in the appointments of Bakshi of the empire and Am\u00edr-ul-Umara so long held by his father. Najf Khan, however, still remained nominally Commander-in-Chief.\n\nZ\u00e1bita Khan remained for some time at his forts of Ghausgarh, Shukart\u00e1r and Pathargarh, reducing the country to order, and establishing his authority amongst the villages occupied by the Gujars and Pundirs, who during the recent troubles had assumed an independent attitude. The Sikhs from the west, too, engaged much of his attention; but having once brought his affairs into order, he conceived himself at liberty to withhold the stipulated tribute from the royal treasury, and prepared to resist any attempts to levy it by force of arms. Abdul K\u00e1sim Kh\u00e1n was sent against him; and Z\u00e1bita Khan, then posted in Ghausgarh, marched out and offered the imperial troops battle. A desperate fight took place, in which the Emperor's army was on the point of proving victorious, when a body of Path\u00e1n horse, which had been planted in an ambuscade, rushed out, and attacking Abdul K\u00e1sim's forces in the rear, utterly discomfited them. The commander himself was slain, and but few of his troops escaped.\n\nInflamed by his success, Z\u00e1bita Kh\u00e1n now took large bodies of Sikhs into his pay; and resolving to persist in his rebellion, actually threatened Dehli itself with a siege. The imperial troops under Mirza Najf Kh\u00e1n were then engaged in the J\u00e1t country, from which they were recalled, and the Emperor himself prepared to lead them against the rebel; but first resolving to see what could be effected by diplomacy, he sent an embassy, consisting of Raja Dya R\u00e1m; the Gosh\u00e1n leader, H\u00edmmat Bah\u00e1dur; and the Oudh envoy, Lat\u00e1f\u00e1t Kh\u00e1n; in advance of the imperial army to Ghausgarh. Though they failed to induce Z\u00e1bita Kh\u00e1n to abate one whit of his pretensions, yet the Emperor was so unwilling to come to an open rupture, that on the\n\n---\n\n1 It is said that Z\u00e1bita Khan not only formed alliances with the principal Sikh chiefs, but even embraced the tenets of the Sikh religion, and became a convert to their faith. (Franklin's Shah Aulum, 71.)\nmere semblance of submission he pardoned the rebel and confirmed him in his government. In addition to this, Mirza Najf Khan took the Path\u00e1n's sister to wife, and his follower, Najf Kuli Khan (a converted Rajput), married Z\u00e1bita's daughter.\n\nIt was at this time (1778) that Walter Reinhard, also known as Sumru or Sombre, was placed in charge of the country adjoining Z\u00e1bita Khan's lands, and fixed his head-quarters at Sardhana in the Meerut District. The Kashmiri Abd\u00fal Ahid Kh\u00e1n, known by his title of Naw\u00e1b Majad-ud-daulah, is said to have been privy to Z\u00e1bita Kh\u00e1n's alliance with the Sikhs; but so well did he keep his connivance secret, that he was chosen to command the imperial army raised to expel the Sikhs from Sirhind in the following year (1778-79). The Prince Imperial, Jaw\u00e1n Bakht, accompanied the army, which was at first successful, but subsequently, owing to the treachery of Majad-ud-daulah, was surprised by a Sikh force at Patiy\u00e1la, and driven back to P\u00e1nipat. The Sikhs then divided into several parties, and, crossing the Jumna, entered the Upper Du\u00e1b, where they committed everywhere acts of cruelty, devastation and death. Mirza Najf Kh\u00e1n was again sent for to take the place of Majad-ud-daulah, now disgraced and imprisoned, and with the titles of Zulfak\u00e1r-ud-daulah and Vakil-i-Matlak, became absolute director of all affairs at Dehli.\n\nAt the commencement of 1780, preparations were made to take the field against the Sikhs, who now for some months had remained in possession of the Du\u00e1b. A large force under Mirza Shafi, a young nobleman of great promise, and nephew of the Captain-General, crossed the Jumna in quest of the enemy. After several ineffectual skirmishes and much desultory fighting, he succeeded, about the middle of August, in bringing them to a decisive action before Meerut. The imperial troops, eager to wipe off the disgrace of their defeat in the previous year, exerted themselves to such good effect, that the Sikh forces were completely routed, with the loss of their leader and 5,000 men, and at once evacuated the country. Mirza Shafi's next care was to settle the country, and finding the people utterly unable to pay up the taxes for the year during which the Du\u00e1b was occupied by the Sikhs, he remitted them in the Emperor's name.\n\nMirza Najf Kh\u00e1n died in the month of April 1782, and amongst the competitors for the vacant post of head of the administration, the principal were Afrasy\u00e1b Kh\u00e1n and Mirza Shafi. The former was the adopted son of the deceased minister, and the latter was his nephew, and held command of the Panj\u00e1b. Each prepared to support his respective pretensions by force of arms, but Afrasy\u00e1b Kh\u00e1n first succeeded in obtaining for a time the insignia of Am\u00edr-ul-Umara. He then released the Kashmiri ex-minister Majad-ud-daulah, and placed him and Najf Kuli Khan in charge of the citadel.\nAfrasy\u00e1b Khan then proceeded to Agra, where Muhammad Beg Hamad\u00e1n\u00ed had attempted to make himself independent. Whilst on his way news arrived that Mirza Shafi had entered Dehli, seized the citadel, and confined the officers who had been left in charge. Afrasy\u00e1b thereupon resolved to make peace with Muhammad Beg, and uniting their forces both marched towards Dehli. In the meantime a counter-revolution took place there, which totally changed the complexion of affairs. The Prince Jaw\u00e1n Bakht aspired to the office of Captain-General, and finding himself supported by M. Paoli, the commandant of Begam Sumru's brigade, Y\u00e1k\u00fab Kh\u00e1n, Lat\u00e1f\u00e1t Kh\u00e1n and other nobles, he induced the Emperor to take the field against Mirza Shafi. The latter, finding himself unable to meet the imperial forces, released Majad-ud-daulah, and with him proceeded to the camp of his whilom inveterate foe Afrasy\u00e1b Kh\u00e1n. These strangely assorted allies met at Muttra, and there agreed that the effects of the late Najf Khan should be equally divided between Mirza Shafi and Afrasy\u00e1b Khan; that the former should be reinstated in the post of Vazir; and that the latter and Muhammad Beg should be left in possession of the Du\u00e1b from Koil southwards. Their united forces then marched towards Dehli, and Majad-ud-daulah was sent to the Emperor with their ultimatum. The Emperor appointed Prince Jaw\u00e1n Bakht, Lat\u00e1f\u00e1t Kh\u00e1n, and M. Paoli to negotiate on his part; but the unfortunate ambassadors fared ill: M. Paoli was assassinated by command of Muhammad Beg, and Lat\u00e1f\u00e1t Khan was taken prisoner, deprived of his sight, and thrown into prison. The Prince alone escaped, but found himself obliged to accompany the conspirators, as if a voluntary actor, in their triumphal entry into Dehli.\n\nThe next scene in this real drama\u00b9 of the \"Reward of treachery, or the unscrupulous Mogul\" rises on a quarrel which broke out between Muhammad Beg and Mirza Shafi. By the convention of Muttra, the former was entitled to a share of the southern Du\u00e1b: but Mirza Shafi refused to carry out this portion of the compact, and further incensed the entire body of the Mughal nobles by avowing his intention of resuming the lands held by them on condition of military service. Dissembling his resentment for a time, Muhammad Beg joined the camp of Afrasy\u00e1b Kh\u00e1n, and induced the latter to invite the Mirza to a conference to settle all their difficulties. Mirza Shafi, attended by a few followers, came on his elephant, and whilst embracing Muhammad Beg, was stabbed from behind by Ism\u00e1\u00edl Beg, the Hamad\u00e1n\u00ed's nephew. Afrasy\u00e1b Kh\u00e1n was at once promoted to the office of Am\u00edr-ul-Umara, whilst Zain-ul-abd\u00edn Kh\u00e1n, the brother of the murdered nobleman, was ordered to give up the Governorship of Meerut, which he then held. Afrasy\u00e1b Khan advanced to Meerut to enforce these orders, but by\n\n\u00b9 The name actually given to a piece in which the principal events of this period were dramatised.\nthe advice of his principal officers first tried the effect of negotiations, with the result that Zain-ul-abdin was induced to throw himself on the Emperor's clemency, and give up the Meerut command, which was then bestowed on Kutb-ud-daulah. Zain-ul-abdin then proceeded to Dehli, where he was formally pardoned, but at the same time kept in a sort of honourable confinement in his own house.\n\nEarly in 1784, Mr. Hastings, the British Governor, arrived at Lucknow, and sent Major Brown as his agent to the Dehli Court.\n\nMirza Jaw\u00e1n Bakht, considering this a good opportunity for attempting to induce the British to interfere on behalf of his father, succeeded, with the aid of a body of G\u00fajars, in making his escape to Lucknow. The presence of the British agent at Dehli was partly due to the natural desire of Mr. Hastings to procure more accurate information regarding Dehli politics than the confused and contradictory rumours that reached him afforded, and partly to his wish to arouse the Dehli Court to make some exertions to stem the tide of Sikh invasion which now threatened to involve the whole Du\u00e1b in one common destruction. Afrasy\u00e1b Khan induced the Emperor to order the return of the Prince, and determined, if he once again got hold of the heir to the throne, to effectually prevent his ever after giving any trouble. Muhammad Beg, too, felt the minister's resentment, and went into open rebellion; whilst Majad-ud-daulah, notwithstanding his great services, was imprisoned in the fort of Meerut. Under these circumstances, Shah Alam, finding himself a mere puppet in the hands of whichever faction chose for the moment to assume the direction of affairs, commenced to intrigue with Sindhia, and in this course of action he was encouraged by Afrasy\u00e1b Khan, who hoped by means of the Marhattas to rid himself of his rival Muhammad Beg.\n\nEarly in 1784, the Emperor, accompanied by Afrasy\u00e1b Khan, marched to Agra, whilst the Marhattas, advancing from the west, encamped at Fathepur, and, opposed to both, lay the forces of Muhammad Beg Hamad\u00e1ni, some forty miles off. Sindhia now found himself appealed to by all three. To Muhammad Beg he granted an interview; and appearing to be satisfied with the explanations which were made, he promised his good offices in procuring the Emperor's pardon for the offender. A few days later, in November, at an interview with Afrasy\u00e1b Kh\u00e1n, Sindhia laid down a plan for a combined attack on Muhammad Beg. Zain-ul-abdin, the ex-commandant of Meerut, had been released from confinement through the influence of Sindhia, and burning to avenge his brother's death and his own disgrace, hung about the imperial camp. He accompanied the chiefs to the interview with Sindhia, and after the ceremony was over, and Sindhia and the other officers had taken leave, there remained no one in the tent except Afrasy\u00e1b Kh\u00e1n and Zain-ul-abdin. The latter entered into conversation with the minister, and professed his strong\ndesire to live in future on a more amicable footing, that all past differences should be forgotten, and that each should consider the interest of the other to be the same as his own. Afrasy\u00e1b Kh\u00e1n, puzzled at this sudden reconciliation, remained for sometime absorbed in silence. When about to reply, Zain-ul-abdin rose up from his seat, and, at this signal, one Mahdi Beg rushed in and stabbed the minister in the breast. Afrasy\u00e1b Kh\u00e1n expired on the spot, and his assassins found refuge in Sindhia's camp, whilst Himmat Bah\u00e1'\u00edlur, the Gosh\u00e1\u00edn leader, and other Mughal officers, repaired to Sindhia's tent, and offered him their congratulations as if he had already been appointed V\u00e1z\u00edr.\n\nWhile these events occurred at Fatchpur, the Emperor was at Agra, and was there joined by Majad-ud-daulah, who found means, not only to effect his own release from prison, but to induce Kuth-ud-daulah, his jailor, to accompany him to Agra. Shah Alam received his old friend with great kindness, and would most probably have taken him into favour and restored him to his former office again, had not both Raja Daya R\u00e1m, and Shuja Dil Kh\u00e1n, the Governor of Agra, endeavoured to arouse suspicions of the Kashmiri's fidelity in the Emperor's mind. The insolent manner in which they urged their remonstrances showed that they, as the partisans of Afrasy\u00e1b Khan, believed that the Emperor was entirely in the power of their faction, and this not a little contributed to the desire Shah Alam showed to escape from their hands. In order to blind his keepers, the Emperor ordered a great portion of his family to remain behind, and, taking Majad-ud-daulah with him, proceeded to Dehli. Sindhia entered Agra, and sent for Muhammad Beg, on whom he conferred a j\u00e1gir of Rs. 16,000 a month from the revenues of Shikohabad, and, further, gave him employment in the Dakhin. Sindhia proceeded from Agra to Dehli, where, in January, 1785, he was invested in full darb\u00e1r with the office of Amir-ul-Umara, whilst the Peshwa, for whom he professed to act, was honoured with the title of Vak\u00edl-i-Matlak, or plenipotentiary of the Empire. As may be supposed, during the late troubles the administration had fallen into the utmost disorder, and the first care of the new minister was given to the improvement of the finances. The collection of the revenue had for several years been in the hands of Raja Daya R\u00e1m; but his behaviour towards the Emperor at Agra determined Sindhia to remove him from that office, which was accordingly bestowed upon Nar\u00e1yan D\u00e1s, a person of great capacity and of some skill as a financier. Sindhia next reduced Agra and Aligarh, and with the capture of the latter fortress acquired the immense accumulations of specie and jewels that a long course of plunder had allowed Afrasy\u00e1b Kh\u00e1n to make. At the close of the year 1785, Z\u00e1bita Kh\u00e1n died, and was succeeded by his eldest son, Ghul\u00e1m K\u00e1dir Kh\u00e1n. Sindhia was master of the whole of the Central and Southern Du\u00e1b. Muhammed Beg\nwas powerless, and, deserted by his troops, was only too glad to accept anything that the new Amir might give him. Mr. James Anderson was the British envoy with Sindhia, and Colonel Harper filled a similar office at the court of the Naw\u00e1b of Oudh, who was still titular Vaz\u00edr of the Empire. Sh\u00e1h Niz\u00e1m-ud-d\u00edn was appointed superintendent of the royal household, for which a provision of \u00a3120,000 a year was allotted.\n\nWe must now return to Sah\u00e1r\u00e1npur affairs. Z\u00e1bita Kh\u00e1n, after a long life of alternate success and misfortune, marked by the evils resulting from an ill-tempered judgment and a naturally restless disposition, died unnoticed and uncared for in the year 1785. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Ghul\u00e1m K\u00e1dir Kh\u00e1n, the same who is said to have received such unpardonable injuries at the hands of the Emperor during the Shukart\u00e1r campaign in 1772. He was a youth of a proud, cruel and ferocious disposition, and at once showed his true character by dispossessing Afzal Kh\u00e1n, brother of Z\u00e1bita Kh\u00e1n, of the lands that had long been in his possession, and by seizing upon his effects. Ghul\u00e1m K\u00e1dir then proceeded to assume all the insignia of independence, and proclaimed himself ruler of the Upper Du\u00e1b under the name of Najib-ud-daulah Hoshy\u00e1r Jang. Affairs to the west of the Jumna so occupied the attention of Sindhia, that Ghul\u00e1m Kadir was allowed to consolidate his power and act as he pleased. The Jaipur prince, assisted by Isma\u00edl Beg, the nephew of Muhammad Beg, defeated Sindhia himself and laid siege to Agra. At the same time Raja Daya R\u00e1m fomented the discords that prevailed amongst the Mughal nobles, and detached them from the Marhatta cause; but falling into the hands of Sh\u00e1h Niz\u00e1m-ud-d\u00edn, Sindhia's Deputy at Dehli, the intriguer was trodden to death by elephants in the royal presence. Dehli was placed in a state of siege, and every preparation made to meet the storm which the Marhatta party felt must sooner or later fall upon them.\n\nThe need of these precautions was soon shown. Ghul\u00e1m K\u00e1dir having, during the last two years, raised and disciplined a considerable force, resolved to make the Empire at large pay for their support, and, marching down the Du\u00e1b, encamped opposite Dehli towards the close of the year 1787. He was encouraged in this step by letters received from Mans\u00far Ali Kh\u00e1n, N\u00e1z\u00edr of the household and a confidant of the Emperor, which urged him to come and demand the vacant office of Am\u00edr-ul-Umara. Shah Niz\u00e1m-ud-d\u00edn and the Desmukh, a son-in-law of Sindhia, in command of the Marhatta force, were inclined to under-estimate the importance of the crisis. They contented themselves with sending small detachments across the river, with orders to attack the force of Ghul\u00e1m K\u00e1dir. The result was, that their troops were defeated with great slaughter, and both the leaders fled to Gwaliar. Ghul\u00e1m K\u00e1dir at once crossed the Jumna, and was introduced\ninto the palace by the treacherous N\u00e1zir. He then demanded the appointment he sought, and the wretched Emperor, seeing himself without resource, was obliged to confer on this arch-rebel an office which now seems to have belonged to any one bold enough to attempt to secure the Emperor's person. Amongst those who, at this time, preferred the existing state of affairs, and had some regard for the Emperor's dignity, was the Begam Sumru, who, on the death of her husband, the infamous Sumru, had succeeded to the command of the disciplined battalions he had raised, and to the possession of the lands granted for their maintenance.\n\nThe adventurer known by the name of Sumru or Sombre\\(^1\\) was a butcher by profession, a native of Salzburg, or some say Troves, in the Duchy of Luxemburg. His real name was Walter Renard or Reinhard. He came to this country as a soldier in the French army, and deserting that service took employment with the British, where he attained to the rank of sergeant. Deserting again, he joined the French party at Chandernagore, and, on the surrender of that settlement, accompanied M. Law in his wanderings throughout India from 1757 to 1760. In the latter year Law's party joined the army of Shah Alam in Bengal, and remained with the Emperor until his defeat in 1761, when M. Law was taken prisoner and his European troops were dispersed. We next find Sumru in the service of Mir K\u00e1sim, by whom he was employed to murder the English prisoners at Patna, in October, 1763. He then escaped into Oudh, and after some time took service in Bundelkhand. We next find him in the J\u00e1t country, where he served Mirza Najf Kh\u00e1p. Deserting him, Sumru entered the service of S\u00faraj Mal, the J\u00e1t leader, with a battalion of disciplined infantry, a detail of artillery, and some three hundred Europeans, the dross of all countries and nationalities. From the J\u00e1ts he went to the Marhattas, whom he served for several years, but deserted to the Imperial army after the battle of Bars\u00e1na in 1775.\n\nIn 1777, Mirza Najf Khan again took Sumru into his service, and, in addition to his own battalions, gave him command of a body of Mughal horse. For the support of the whole he assigned him the parganah of Sardhana and the adjacent lands, then valued at six lakhs of rupees a year. On the death of Reinhard, in 1778 A.D., his force was maintained by his widow. This remarkable woman was the daughter, by a concubine, of Asad Kh\u00e1n, a Musalm\u00e1n of Arab descent, settled in the town of Kut\u00e1na in the Meerut District. She was born about the year 1753 A.D. On the death of her father, she and her mother became subject to ill-treatment from her half-brother, the legitimate heir, and they consequently removed to\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The name Sombre is said to have been given to him from his gloomy disposition; whilst others say it arose from his assuming the name of Walter Summers. The latter account gives the more probable origin of the name.\nDehli about 1760. There she entered the service of Sumru, and accompanied him through all his campaigns. Sumru, on retiring to Sardhana, found himself relieved of all the cares and troubles of war, and gave himself entirely up to a life of ease and pleasure, and so completely fell into the hands of the Begam, that she had no difficulty in inducing him to exchange the title of mistress for that of wife. Having attained to this dignity, she perseveringly exercised the rights thereby attained, to raise herself to the actual enjoyment of all the powers derived from Sumru's political position. Sumru died in 1778, and was buried in the Roman Catholic cemetery at Agra, where his tomb still exists.\n\nSumru left a son, Zafary\u00e1b Khan, by a concubine named Baha Begam, but his widow assumed the management of the estate and the command of the troops, which now numbered five battalions of sepoys, about 300 European officers and gunners, with forty pieces of cannon, and a body of irregular horse. In 1781 the Begam was baptised, according to the ritual of the Roman Catholic Church, under the name of Johanna. Her troops were at this time commanded by a German named Paoli, who intrigued with the Prince Mirza Jaw\u00e1n Bakht against the Shafi and Rohilla faction, to raise the Prince to the dignity of Amir-ul-Umara, and, as we have seen, was assassinated by order of Muhammad Beg Hamad\u00e1ni in 1783 A.D. After the murder of Paoli, Messrs. Baours, Evans, and Dudronec successively commanded the Begam's forces, which were principally occupied in opposing the inroads of the Sikhs. In 1787 George Thomas entered the Begam's service at Dehli. Sumru's party was never famed for their military achievements. They never gained a gun and never lost one until they were defeated by the British at Ajanta Gh\u00e1t. Sumru was distinguished for his excellent retreats. He was accustomed to draw up his men in line, fire a few shots, form a square, and retreat, so that if his corps gained no laurels, they preserved their reputation. His troops were the most mutinous in India, and are said to have frequently attacked their own officers and beaten them with clubs, whilst on more than one occasion Sumru was tied astride a gun, and exposed to the mid-day heat, to compel him to obey their wishes.\n\nHaving brought the history of the Sardhana fief down to the year 1787, I shall proceed with the main story. Ghul\u00e1m K\u00e1dir, on obtaining his patent of Amir-Ul-umara, made office, opened communications with the Begam, then operating against the cis-Satlaj Sikhs. He offered her,\n\n---\n\n1 The inscription on it runs thus\u2014\n\n| AQUIAZ. | EO AOS 4. |\n| OWALT. | DE MAYO. |\n| ERREINHA. | NO ANNO. |\n| RD MORR. | DE 1778. |\nnot only an extension of her j\u00e1tir, but even an equal share in the administration of affairs, if she would support his authority. Well versed in eastern politics, and well acquainted with the Afgh\u00e1n character for treachery, the Begam repulsed these offers with scorn, and advanced with her troops to the capital. Here she was received as the saviour of the imperial cause, and so intimidated the rebels that they withdrew across the Jumna. From thence Ghul\u00e1m K\u00e1dir demanded the dismissal of the Begam and her troops; and on this not being granted, opened fire upon the palace itself. For some time desultory skirmishes took place, and though Najf Kuli Khan came to the assistance of the Emperor, little impression was made on the rebel's force. Marching down the Du\u00e1b, Ghul\u00e1m K\u00e1dir possessed himself of Aligarh, and, uniting his forces with those of Ismail Beg, defeated R\u00e1na Kh\u00e1n, the Marhatta General, at Ch\u00e1ks\u00fa. Mans\u00far Ali Kh\u00e1n, faithful to his friend Ghul\u00e1m K\u00e1dir, refused to supply the Emperor's purse, and conveyed intimation to the enemy that the Prince Jaw\u00e1n Bakht was approaching, with a large force, to relieve the city. He further advised that Ghul\u00e1m K\u00e1dir should embrace this opportunity to make terms whilst he was still able. Profiting by this counsel, the Rohilla signified his sorrow for his late conduct, and offered to restore the lands in the Du\u00e1b that he had lately usurped. These offers, backed by a handsome present in ready money, of which the imperial treasury stood in much need, were accepted, and the rebel marched back to Sah\u00e1r\u00e1npur, with the confirmation of his appointment as \"first of the nobles\" in his hand.\n\nThe conduct of Sindhia during this time needs explanation, and the materials available do not afford anything that can be considered satisfactory. On establishing his authority in Upper India, Sindhia found that the greater portion of the State lands was parcelled out amongst the Mughal nobles on condition of military service, and resolved to carry out the project attempted by Mirza Shafi and others, and resume these grants, paying those employed in the army from the public funds, and devoting the revenues of the resumed lands to this purpose, and to the support of a standing army raised and disciplined in the European fashion. The design was carried out, but not without considerable murmurs, which nothing but the presence of an overwhelming Marhatta force prevented from breaking out into open rebellion. Nar\u00e1yan D\u00e1s, too, was removed from the superintendence of the revenue, which was conferred upon Shah Niz\u00e1m-ud-d\u00edn, whilom superintendent of the imperial household. In this critical time of doubt and uncertainty, matters were brought to a crisis by the action of the Jaipur Prince, who induced Muhammad Beg to join him, and, on his death in battle, Ismail Beg, his nephew, became the head of the malcontent Mughals. In the war between Sindhia and the Raja of Jaipur, small bodies of Mughal troops, led by men whose lands Sindhia had resumed, continually deserted to the enemy,\nand in the end he had none but his own countrymen to rely upon. Numbers proving too much for him, Sindhia retired to Gwalior to await reinforcements, and for a time was powerless to prevent the advance of the Rohilla adventurer. These facts, we may fairly infer, were the causes which led to the inaction of the Marhattas during the eventful year 1787.\n\nIn the beginning of 1788, Sindhia prepared to cross the Chambal, whilst the Emperor himself also awoke to new life, and commenced a royal progress throughout the territories close to the capital. The Raja of Jaipur was compelled to yield the usual tribute, and Najf Kuli Kh\u00e1n was invested in his strong fortress of Gokalgarh. The latter had the presumption to demand the office of Amir-ul-Umara as a condition of his submission; and were it not for the urgent representations of some of the few faithful friends of the court that still remained, the Emperor would have consented to the arrangement, especially as the proposition was coupled with the offer of \u00a360,000 in ready cash as the fine on investiture. The imperial troops comprised, at this time, several battalions of half disciplined levies known as najds, the body-guard called the red battalion, a considerable force of irregular horse, and three battalions of disciplined infantry from the Sardhana fief, under the command of George Thomas, with a respectable train of artillery. Najf Kuli Kh\u00e1n himself lay in an intrenched post at about a mile from the fort. The Gosh\u00e1in Raja, Himmat Bah\u00e1dur, commanded the force opposed to Najf Kuli, and the Emperor himself invested the fort with the main portion of the army. The Gosh\u00e1in\u2019s forces were, for the most part, a rabble composed of the dregs of the armies of all the nations of India. He had only two disciplined battalions under a Danish leader, Colonel Meiselback, that did good service both here and in Bundelkhand.\u00b9 The officers of his force, accustomed to riot and debauchery, could not bear the unwonted labour of the trenches, and, forgetful of the danger of their situation, continued to indulge themselves to excess. The soldiers soon followed the example of their leaders. Najf Kuli being informed of this state of things by his spies, selected a strong detachment of cavalry, and made a night attack on the Gosh\u00e1in\u2019s quarter. The lines were instantly carried, and such a general slaughter took place that any possibility of a rally was prevented. The terror caused by this sudden attack communicated itself to the main body, who began to prepare for flight, and for this they were the more ready when they found that Mans\u00far Kh\u00e1n, who commanded in Gokalgarh, had, by an arrangement preconcerted with Najf Kuli, slipped out of the fort, and attacked the imperial camp in the rear.\n\nShah Alam and his family were now in the greatest danger. Their tents were struck and removed to the advanced guard commanded by Shah M\u00edr Kh\u00e1n, who endeavoured to rally\n\n\u00b9 See Gazetteer Index, Vol. I, under \u2018Meiselback\u2019.\nthe flying troops. The Sardhana brigade, under the command of George Thomas, and with the Begam in person present, now greatly distinguished itself. At the first alarm they drew up as if on parade, and the Begam sent a respectful message to Shah Alam, desiring him to repair to her quarters, and she would punish the rebel or die in defence of the imperial cause. At the same time she wrote to Najf Kuli, upbraiding him for his conduct, and threatening him with exemplary punishment should he persist. She then placed herself in her palanquin at the head of one hundred men, who, led by George Thomas, repeatedly charged the troops of Mansur Khan, and drove them back to the fort. The imperial leaders had now time to collect their men, and Himmat Bahadur and Shah Mir Khan led the attack against Najf Kuli, who was eventually obliged to retire with heavy loss. The brave Shah Mir Khan was killed on the Emperor's side. Najf Kuli Khan submitted, and in the darbar held for this purpose, the Begam was invested with a dress of honour, and received the title of \"daughter of the Emperor\" and \"Ornament of her sex\" (zeb-un-nissa), with the parganah of Badshahpur in jagir.\n\nSindhia, on advancing into the Doab, sent Rana Khan to relieve the fort of Agra, which was still besieged by Ismail Beg. The latter had previously made engagements with Ghulam Kadir for their mutual support, but the faithless Rohilla had no intention of carrying out his part of the treaty. The consequence of this conduct was, that Ismail Beg was defeated and obliged to fly to the Rohilla camp, then at Aligarh. The united forces proceeded northward, and, after expelling Sindhia's troops from the Doab, marched upon Dehli, with the intention of plundering the imperial palaces. The immediate cause for this step was the alleged discovery of a letter addressed to Sindhia by Shah Alam, in which he called on the Marhattas for assistance. The Nazir, Mansur Ali Khan, still held the first place in Shah Alam's counsels, and still kept up a traitorous correspondence with the Rohillas. By his influence, Himmat Bahadur and the few Mughal nobles then at court abandoned the palace and city, and left the Emperor in the hands of the rebels. Ghulam Kadir and Ismail Beg, with two thousand Rohillas, took possession of the palace, and forced themselves into the hall of audience, where they found the Emperor, and standing on each side of the throne, obliged him to approve of all their acts. They then dismissed him to the inner apartments, and consulted on their future course of action.\n\nThe Nazir was admitted to their counsels, and by his advice one Sital Weakness of the Emperor. Das, a sub-treasurer, was sent to Shah Alam, with a message that one of the young princes should be sent to accompany the army against the Marhattas, whilst the citadel and garrison should be immediately delivered up to the Rohillas. To strengthen this proposal, Ghulam Kadir, with his own hand, drew up an agreement, in\nwhich he solemnly swore to defend the person and interests of Shah Alam against all comers. Though Sital D\u00e1s used his utmost endeavours to dissuade the Emperor from accepting these proposals, he was sent back with the agreement ratified by the sign manual, and sealed with the imperial seal. In the meantime the Rohilla troops kept pouring in, and in a short time occupied both palace and fort. The imperial troops were disarmed and expelled, and their officers were placed in confinement. Ghul\u00e1m K\u00e1dir then insolently demanded the keys of the imperial treasury, and when informed that the coffers were empty, prepared to offer the last indignities to the aged Emperor.\n\nEarly the next morning, Ghul\u00e1m K\u00e1dir, accompanied by a numerous band of followers, entered the audience chamber, and expelled all the inmates except Shah Alam. He then sent for Bedar Bakht, a son of the late Emperor Ahmad Shah, from Sal\u00edmgarh, and placed him on the throne under the name of Jah\u00e1n Shah. Shah Alam and his family were transferred to Sal\u00edmgarh, and his quarters in the palace were occupied by Jah\u00e1n Shah. The next stop was the plunder of the ladies of the haram. Mali-kah Zam\u00e1na and Sahiba Mal\u00fal, the widows of Mahm\u00fad Shah, first felt the rebel's cruelty. They were ordered to appear, and to them was committed the inviolable task of removing the jewellery from the persons of the inmates of the seraglio. The spoil produced did not satisfy the inhuman tyrant, who then ordered that those ladies themselves should be plundered of all they possessed, and be expelled from the palace. Jah\u00e1n Shah himself was next sent on a similar errand, and by menaces and entreaties succeeded in procuring a large amount of jewellery, which he sent on trays to the Rohilla. Dissatisfied with this also, Ghul\u00e1m K\u00e1dir sent for the Emperor and all his family, and sternly demanded the imperial treasures. In vain did the Emperor plead his utter poverty and the emptiness of his coffers. Inflamed by a protracted debauch, which had thrown him into a paroxysm of rage, the tyrant threatened his sovereign with instant loss of sight. \"What!\" exclaimed the suffering prince, \"what! will you destroy these eyes, which for a period of sixty years have been assiduously employed in perusing the sacred Kor\u00e1n?\"\n\nRegardless of this appeal, the Rohilla caused the Emperor to be thrown down, and planting himself on the bosom of the prostrate prince, transfixed his eyes with a poignard, and expelled him, with every mark of indignity, pale and bleeding, from the audience chamber. This occurred on the 10th August, 1788.\n\nThe next to feel what the barbarity of a degraded Afgh\u00e1n could do and dare was the N\u00e1z\u00edr, Mans\u00far Ali, the treacherous confederate of Ghul\u00e1m K\u00e1dir. Perhaps some compunctions visited even him for his conduct towards his master. On the occasion of the installation of Jah\u00e1n Shah, when the deposed Emperor cried out in his agony\u2014\"Better will it be for Ghul\u00e1m K\u00e1dir to plunge his dagger in my bosom\nthan load me with such indignity,\" the Rohilla put his hand on his sword; and had not the N\u00e1zir restrained him, would then and there have put an end to the Emperor's sufferings. However this may be, the N\u00e1zir rendered himself an object of suspicion to Ghul\u00e1m K\u00e1dir, who put him into close confinement, and plundered him of all his effects, to the amount of \u00a370,090. In all these acts Ismail Beg was a passive participator; but when he asked for a share of the spoil, the Rohilla refused to acknowledge him. Incensed at this, Ismail Beg offered his services to the Marhattas, who, under R\u00e1n\u00e1 Khan, advanced on Dehli.\n\nGhul\u00e1m K\u00e1dir, hearing of the approach of the avenging army, collected all Capture and death of his spoil, and, taking with him the imperial family and Ghul\u00e1m K\u00e1dir. the N\u00e1zir, fled to Meerut. The Marhattas occupied Dehli, Ismail Beg was despatched to act against Gokalgarh, and R\u00e1n\u00e1 Kh\u00e1n and App\u00e1khandi Rao, with Ali Bah\u00e1dur from Bundelkhand, invested Meerut. Ghul\u00e1m K\u00e1dir cut his way through the besieging army, and fled towards Sah\u00e1ranpur, but was captured on the way, and handed over to the Marhattas. On refusing to discover the place where he had deposited the spoils of the palace, he was confined in an iron cage constructed for the purpose, and carried in front of the army. Day by day he lost a hand, an ear, or a foot, until death put an end to his sufferings. His confederate, the N\u00e1zir, was trodden to death by elephants,\u2014both thus dreadfully atoning for their great and many crimes. The Marhattas next reduced the whole of the Upper Du\u00e1b, and in their hands it remained until it was conquered by the British.\n\nShah Alam was again restored to the throne of his ancestors, with an allowance of \u00a390,000 per annum for the support of his Sindhia supreme at Dehli. household, which was again placed under the control of Shah Niz\u00e1m-ud-d\u00edn. Ismail Beg, who had been sent against Najf Kuli Kh\u00e1n, found that in the meantime his opponent had died, and that his widow was in command of the troops. She induced him to take her side against the Marhattas, and for some time their combined forces maintained their ground, until the death of the widow in battle induced her troops to abandon Ismail Beg. He then surrendered himself to the Marhattas, and was conveyed a prisoner to Agra, where he died in 1799. Sindhia's next enemy was Holkar, whose forces were almost annihilated in the bloody action of Lakhairi, near K\u00e1n\u00fand, in 1792. In this battle the disciplined troops of Sindhia, under M. deBoigne, greatly distinguished themselves, so that the Marhatta directed their increase to 24,000 infantry and 130 pieces of artillery, and assigned for their support fifty-two districts in the Du\u00e1b. Towards the middle of 1793, Sindhia returned to his own country, leaving Gop\u00e1l Rao as his representative in the north, and M. deBoigne in command in the centre of his new possessions. Sindhia died in February, 1794, at Wanauli, near Poona, and was succeeded by his nephew Daulat Rao. The remainder of the general history of the Upper Du\u00e1b may be divided\ninto a few sections,\u2014the rise of George Thomas, the continuation of the account of the Sardhana fief, the Marhatta administration, and the arrival of the British.\n\nThe short and brilliant career of George Thomas distinguishes him amidst the crowd of European adventurers in the Marhatta service who at this time sought their fortunes in upper India. He was a native of Tipperary in Ireland, and came to Madras as a sailor in a man-of-war about 1782. In Madras he deserted his ship to join the forces of some Polig\u00e1r chief; and in 1787 made his way to Dehli, where he entered the service of Begam Sumru. Here he distinguished himself at the siege of Gokalgarh, and remained at Sardhana until 1792, when LeVaisseau, the commandant of the Begam's artillery, who had always been the rival and bitter enemy of Thomas, succeeded in supplanting him in the Begam's confidence. Thomas, ill-brooking his disgrace, resigned his employment, and betook himself, to the town of An\u00fapshahr, then a frontier-station of British troops. He had not been long here, when overtures were made to him on the part of App\u00e1kandi Rao, the Marhatta Governor of the trans-Jumna territory, who, at this time, sought to establish his authority in Ismail Beg's former j\u00e1gir of Mewat. Thomas accepted the Marhatta service, and in a short time so distinguished himself, that his employer presented him with several parganahs in j\u00e1gir as a reward for good and faithful service,\u2014the latter a novelty in Marhatta politics.\n\nThe gift, however, was not so valuable as might have been expected. These parganahs were inhabited by a wild and warlike race, living in fortified villages, and accustomed to oppose all comers, whether with cause or without cause. It took Thomas many months and much hard marching and fighting to reduce them to even a semblance of submission, and this only lasted whilst he was within recall. Though an unprofitable field as a source of revenue, his j\u00e1gir gave Thomas an excuse for keeping up a large force, who, by discipline and experience, soon became a body of men that could be relied upon in the field against any of the surrounding tribes. His fame increased, and with it his power, for soldiers of fortune from the Du\u00e1b and Rohilkhand continually flocked to his standard, and in a few years he found himself at the head of two well-drilled battalions of infantry, with a complement of irregular horse and cavalry, and a park of field artillery. Begam Sumru, instigated by LeVaisseau, now her husband, sought in every way to injure Thomas, and urged on his Marhatta employers the danger of allowing a man of his character to assume a position of quasi-independence. She even marched against him with the entire force of the Sardhana j\u00e1gir; but before reaching his territory, a mutiny amongst her troops and the death of LeVaisseau put an end to the expedition. Whether worked on by the Begam's remonstrances, or actuated by selfish motives of his own, even App\u00e1kandi Rao,\nMade Warden of the Marches whose life Thomas, on more than one occasion, had saved, was induced to plot his destruction; but twice the hired assassins failed in their attempts. Notwithstanding that Thomas was well aware of all this treachery, he took no notice of its authors, and was always ready to carry out the orders he received, though frequently their execution was both difficult and dangerous. One of his principal duties was to oppose the invasions of the Sikhs from the west; and in this he was so successful, that Lakwa D\u00e1da, who had succeeded Gopal Rao as the Marhatta commander in the north of the Do\u00e1b, assigned him a second j\u00e1gir, and gave him charge of the entire frontier of the present Meerut Division. Whilst thus employed, he returned good for evil by reinstating the Begam at Sardhana, whence she had been driven by a mutiny of her troops; and he also distinguished himself at the sieges of Sh\u00e1ml\u00ed and Lakhnauti. About this time App\u00e1kandi Rao, whilst suffering from an incurable disease, performed the sam\u00e1dhi by drowning himself in the Jumna, and was succeeded by his nephew, V\u00e1man Rao, whose first desire was to resume the j\u00e1girs held by Thomas.\n\nThomas, on hearing of this, retired to his own country, and strengthened himself there by raising more troops and building small forts, to which he might retire, or which might serve as d\u00e9p\u00f4ts for stores and ammunition. He, at the same time, continued his operations against the Sikhs, whose forces he frequently repulsed. Whilst thus engaged, V\u00e1man Rao attacked J\u00e9jh\u00e1r, but retired on hearing of Thomas's approach; and the latter took the opportunity of invading and plundering par-ganah D\u00e1d\u00ed, now in the Bulandshahr District, and then held by one Kashmir\u00ed Boli, who was justly suspected of being the instigator of V\u00e1man Rao's treacherous attack. The breach was further widened by some misunderstanding with B\u00e1p\u00fa Sindhia, the successor of Lakw\u00e1 D\u00e1da at Sah\u00e1r\u00e1npur, whose troops Thomas defeated in two successive actions. Thomas was now considered dangerous enough to be left alone; and having no money to pay his troops, he led them into the Jaipur and other neighbouring States, where he levied contributions sufficient to satisfy their present wants. This state of things could not continue for long, and he looked about for means whereby he might place his affairs on a more stable foundation.\n\nIn 1798, Thomas first formed the design of carving out an independent kingdom for himself, and for this purpose selected the tract known as Hari\u00e1na, which, from the troubled state of the times, had for some years acknowledged no master. His first efforts against Kanhor\u00ed were unsuccessful, but persevering in his attacks, he eventually reduced it to submission, and with it the south of the province fell into his hands. In the north the Raja of Patiy\u00e1l\u00e1 and the Bhat\u00eds held out for some time; but by the close of the cold weather, Thomas had extended his authority\nas far as the river Sars\u00fati, and included the important towns of H\u00e1nsi, Hiss\u00e1r, Mah\u00edm and Tuh\u00e1na amongst his possessions. He selected H\u00e1nsi as the capital of his State, rebuilt the walls and fort, established a mint, cannon foundry, and a manufactory of powder and small arms. To attach his soldiers to his service he granted pensions to the wounded, and to the families of those who perished in battle he allowed half the pay drawn by the deceased. It was his desire to put himself in a capacity, when a favourable opportunity should offer, of attempting the conquest of the Panj\u00e1b, and he aspired to the honour of planting the British standard \"on the banks of the Attock (Indus).\" One of his first expeditions was in conjunction with V\u00e1man Rao, the Marhatta Sub-Governor of Bulandshahr, against the Raja of Jaipur. The combined forces were at first successful, and captured the important town of Fatehpur; but the Raja, advancing against them with a levy en masse, compelled the Marhattas to retire, and eventually to make peace. Thomas was not much more successful in an attack on Bikan\u00edr. Towards the close of 1799, he joined with Ambaji Ingli\u00e1 in an expedition against the territories of the R\u00e1n\u00e1 of Udepur, one of the most powerful and important of the Rajp\u00fat States. Their object was to expel Lakw\u00e1 D\u00e1d\u00e1, the Marhatta commander there, who had joined the R\u00e1n\u00e1, and acted in opposition to Sindhia's orders in regard to his predecessor's widows, the B\u00e1\u00eds. In this expedition, chiefly through Thomas's skill, they were successful.\n\nWhilst engaged in Udepur, the enemies of Thomas were not slow to take advantage of his absence to invade Hari\u00e1na; and, with him, the usual duplicity evinced by those in power, especially amongst the Marhattas, the foremost amongst his assailants was Ambaji, his own colleague, and General Perron, the Marhatta commander in the Du\u00e1b. Both concluded that as Lakw\u00e1 D\u00e1da had fallen in battle, and Holkar's force was completely defeated at Ind\u00far, there was no further need for Thomas's services, and that his growing power would make him a formidable enemy in the event of his interests ever clashing with theirs. Thomas, however, proceeded on his way as if nothing had happened, and the invasion of the Sikhs, and other matters requiring prompt attention on the part of Perron, becoming more pressing, Thomas and his possessions were for a time saved. During this interval of rest, Thomas employed himself in arranging the affairs of Bikan\u00edr and Jodhpur, and at the same time he made occasional excursions into the Du\u00e1b. His own towns, too, often occupied his whole attention, and more than once he was obliged to sit down and regularly invest Bhaw\u00e1n\u00ed, Jam\u00e1lpur, and others places.\n\nPerron at length took the field against Thomas, with a force of ten battalions of infantry, six thousand horse, a body of Rohillas, and sixty pieces of heavy artillery. A portion of this force, under Captain Smith, invested Georgegarh, a small fort built by Thomas near J\u00e1jhar, and another, under a Mr. Lewis, advanced on Mah\u00edm. Thomas succeeded in\nraising the siege of Georgegarh, and defeated Captain Smith, with the loss of his ammunition and baggage; and again, in a battle fought near Bairi, he routed the combined forces of Perron, Smith and Lewis, with a loss to the enemy of 2,000 men and thirty pieces of artillery, and a loss on his own side of 700 men, and twenty pieces of artillery rendered unfit for future service. Perron, dismayed at this defeat, made every effort to collect reinforcements from all sides. From Saharanpur came the forces of Bapu Sindhia; from the west a number of Sikh chieftains who had long felt the power of Thomas to be a bar to their plundering expeditions; Meerut furnished a contingent under the Gujjar Rajas Ramdayal and Nain Singh; from Aligarh came the Hathras and Mursan Rajas; Colonel Hessing came from Agra; and from the south the Jat ruler of Bharatpur joined the confederate camp with a large following. Thirty thousand men, and a train of one hundred and ten pieces of artillery, now surrounded Thomas on all sides, and so overawed the peasantry of the neighbourhood, that they ceased to bring him in supplies. Many of his own officers, whose families resided within the districts in the occupation of the enemy, were bought over, and carried with them the troops under their command. Conspicuous amongst these were Shitab Khan, the commandant of Georgegarh, and Khairat Khan, the subahdar of his first matchlock regiment. Unable to meet the enemy in the field, Thomas cut his way through their midst, and succeeded in reaching Hansi; but here, too, treachery was rife, and he was eventually compelled to yield up the fort, and, with the escort of one battalion of sepoys, crossed the English frontier in January, 1802, and proceeded thence towards Calcutta. He only reached as far as Bahrampur, where he died on the 22nd August, and was buried in the English cemetery.\n\nThus closed the career of one of the most remarkable men amongst the many that appeared during the troublous times preceding the advent of the British. It was his fixed intention, after consolidating his possessions about Hansi, to invade the Panjab and plant his standard on the Indus. This he resolved to accomplish by a fleet of boats, constructed from timber procured in the forests near Firozpur on the Satlaj, by means of which, proceeding down the river with his army, and settling the districts he might subdue on his way, he hoped to reduce the whole country within one or two years. At the same time he offered his services, his territory, and his army to the British, detailing his plans, and declaring that he had nothing in view but \"the welfare of his king and country.\" In the words of his biographer and friend\u2014\"Upon the whole, however, we may be justified in remarking that, on a review of the life and actions of this very extraordinary man, it is difficult which most to admire, whether the intrepidity of spirit by which he was incited to the performance of actions which, by their effect,\n\n---\n\n1 Franklin's Memoir of George Thomas, London, 1806, p. 338.\nraised him from the condition of a private subject to rank and distinction among princes, or the wonderful and uncommon attachment generally exhibited towards his person by natives of every description, who fought and conquered with him in his long and arduous career, and whose assistance exalted him for a time to a height of respectability and consequence that seldom falls to the lot of an individual.\"\n\nI have already brought down the history of the Sardhana fief to the year\n\nFurther history of the 1787 A.D. In that year the Begam was joined by Sardhana fief. George Thomas, who remained in her service until the year 1792. During this time the Begam obtained great influence in the imperial councils; and, endowed by nature with masculine intrepidity and a correct judgment, she was able to hold her own country and preserve her authority unimpaired under the successive administrations of Najf Khan, Mirza Shafi and Afrasyab Khan. When Sindhia in 1785 became supreme, he added to her possessions certain parganahs on the western bank of the Jumna; and such confidence had he in her ability and integrity, that in the war with Jaipur he committed to her charge the important station of Panipat. When Ghulam Kadir invested Dehli, in 1787, the Begam at once marched to the assistance of the Emperor, and, declining all overtures from the rebel, resolutely compelled him to withdraw across the Jumna. Here a reconciliation was patched up between Shah Alam and Ghulam Kadir, and the Rohilla departed to his own country.\n\nIn 1788, the Begam's troops, as we have already seen, distinguished themselves at the siege of Gokalgarh and in the capture of Meerut. Early in 1792, the Begam began to show a partiality for M. LeVaisseau, or LeVassont as he is also called, a young Frenchman of birth, talents and great pride of character, who had been for some time in her service, which ended in his marrying the Begam privately, in order to bring the corps under his own command. George Thomas at once sent in his resignation and entered the Marhatta service, whilst LeVaisseau set about to reform his turbulent troops.\n\nBut not content with the work he had to do at home, he must needs intrigue against Thomas, who was then employed in reducing the districts contiguous to the Begam's trans-Jumna possessions. Thomas retaliated by plundering the Begam's parganahs. In 1793 the Begam, in concert with the Marhatta Governor of Dehli, sent a force to watch Thomas, who retired to Tijara. The Begam then went so far as to bribe the Marhatta officers to advise his dismissal; and a body of Marhattas having joined her army, she marched from Sardhana to Thomas's new district of Jhajjar. Her force then consisted of four battalions of infantry, 20 pieces of artillery, and about 400 cavalry, whilst Thomas had only 2,000 men, with ten guns and 700 cavalry.\n\nIt was no secret that the expedition was intended to act against Thomas;\n\n1 The Begam then added the name of Nobili to Johanna.\nbut events now took place, which not only induced the Begam to relinquish her intention of attacking Thomas, but ended in the total subversion of her authority for the time.\n\nThere was at this time in the Begam's employ a native of Liege, only known by his nick name of Liegeois, who had been for many years an intimate friend of Thomas, and on the present occasion used all his endeavours to bring about a reconciliation. His conduct was highly displeasing to LeVaisseau, who used his influence with the Begam to procure the Liegeois' degradation; and to make his disgrace more mortifying, the place was given to a junior officer, a creature of LeVaisseau's. The soldiers, ever ready for mutiny, sided with the Liegeois, and resolved to effect the downfall of both the Begam and LeVaisseau, who, owing to the privacy with which the marriage ceremony was performed, was looked upon as her paramour. They invited Zafary\u00e1b Khan, the son of the late Sumru, from Dehli, to become their commander. This young man, who has been characterised by a contemporary as \"a compound of ignorance, cruelty and debauchery,\" consented to join the conspiracy, on condition that the deputation sent by the army to invite him should take an oath of fidelity to him on the spot. Having sworn allegiance to their new leader, the rebel troops, with Zafary\u00e1b Kh\u00e1n at their head, proceeded, in May, 1795, towards Sardhana, to which place the Begam and her husband had fled on hearing of the negotiations at Dehli.\n\nWhether from jealousy, satiety, or some other cause, the Begam herself now became as anxious to get rid of her husband as she had formerly been to obtain the sanction of the Church to her passion for him. The rational explanation of her conduct on this occasion would, however, appear to be the discovery that LeVaisseau was unfitted by temperament to manage the unruly body of troops that she was obliged to entertain. To accomplish her purpose, she is said to have got up the revolution that we have just noticed, representing to her husband that a plan had been laid for murdering both herself and him, and seizing on the jdytr; and urged him, thereupon, to collect all the treasure that could readily be transported, and by flight save both their lives and a portion of their wealth. Having thus far succeeded, she extorted from her intended victim a vow, in which she joined, to the effect that, in case of her flight being intercepted, each party should, by death, secure escape from the probable consequences; and to enable her to effect this, should it become necessary, the lady, as well as her husband, carried arms. All arrangements being perfected, the fugitives, with their treasure, departed under the cover of night; but scarcely had they passed the boundary of her own jdytr, than they encountered a party of troops, placed in the position which they occupied by order of the Begam. Resistance and recourse to flight seemed alike hopeless, and the report of a pistol from the Begam's pdlk\u00ed, followed\nby loud cries from her attendants, assured the husband that his wife had performed her share in their mutual agreement. Portions of her garments, stained with blood, were exhibited to confirm the impression, and, under the influence of terror, more probably than of conscientious regard for his pledge, the entrapped victim followed the supposed example of his wife, and with a pistol terminated his life.\n\nOf the actual occurrence of this catastrophe there is no reason to doubt; but the circumstances attending it are so differently related, that there is much difficulty in ascertaining the real facts. The story, as told by Mundy and Bacon, is given above.\u00b9 George Thomas's biographer\u00b2 relates that the Begam and her husband were cut off in their intended flight into British territory at the village of Karwa, close to Sardhana, and that the troops who were with her were promised a free pardon and their arrears of pay on condition of their laying down their arms and giving up the Begam and her husband. In the confusion that arose, and before any resolution could be taken, some shots were fired and a few men were slightly wounded. The soldiers, perceiving they had nothing to hope from the Begam, openly declared themselves for Sumru's son. The infantry then surrounded her palanquin, and demanded her surrender; the cavalry at the same time surrounded her husband who was on horseback. The Begam at that instant drew a poniard from her side, and running the point of it across her breast, drew a little blood, but with no intention of killing herself. Her attendants called for assistance, and LeVaisseau hearing the tumult, demanded to know what had happened. He was answered that the Begam had killed herself. Twice he put the same question, and twice he received the same answer, on which he deliberately shot himself in the mouth.\n\nSleeman, who had particularly good opportunities for ascertaining the real facts of the case, whilst repeating the story of the compact between the husband and wife \"that neither should survive the other,\" describes the actual occurrence as follows:\u2014\u201cThey had got three miles on the road to Meerut, when they found the battalions gaining fast upon the palanquin. LeVaisseau drew a pistol from his holster, and urged on the bearers. He could easily have galloped off and saved himself, but he would not quit his wife's side. At last the soldiers came up close behind them. The female attendants on the Begam began to scream, and, looking into the litter, LeVaisseau saw the white cloth covered with blood. The Begam had stabbed herself, but the dagger had struck against one of the bones of her chest, and she had not courage to repeat the blow. Her husband put the pistol to his temple and fired. The ball passed through his head, and he fell dead to the\n\n\u00b9 Bacon's First Impressions, II, 41; Mundy's Sketches, I, 371, as quoted by Thornton.\n\u00b2 Francklin's life of Thomas, 59.\nground.\u201d On the evidence, as a whole, this may be accepted as the most correct account; and subsequent events would seem to corroborate the opinion that the Begam was not in league with the mutineers. Thomas\u2019s account gives no support to the contrary opinion; and had he believed the Begam guilty, he would probably have mentioned his belief to his biographer.\n\nOn the death of LeVaisseau, \u201cthe villains,\u201d says Thomas, \u201cwho, the Begam restored preceding day, had styled themselves his slaves, now by Thomas committed every act of insult and indignity upon his corpse.\u201d For three days it lay exposed to the insults of the rabble, and was at length thrown into a ditch. The Begam herself was carried back to the fort, and stripped of all her property and tied to a gun, and would here have perished of starvation and exposure had she not been attended to by a faithful servant, who supplied all her wants. Released from her terrible position by the good offices of M. Saleur, a gentleman of her army, the Begam was still kept in confinement. Here she found means to communicate with George Thomas, and implored him to assist in her release, promising any sum that the Marhattas would demand if again reinstated in her j\u0101gir. On receipt of these letters, Thomas, by an offer of \u00a312,000, prevailed on B\u00e1p\u00fa Sindhia, the Marhatta Governor of the Upper D\u016b\u00e1b, to march towards Sardhana; and in the meantime Thomas himself intrigued with the mutineers, and finding a party amongst them favourable to the restoration, advanced to within a few miles of Sardhana with his own troops. To assist him in his negotiations, he sent a message, proclaiming that he was come by order of the Marhatta chief to reinstate the Begam. This proceeding had the desired effect. A portion of the troops mutinied, and confined Zafary\u00e1b Kh\u00e1n; but before Thomas could arrive he was again released. Thomas, ignorant of this change in affairs, advanced with a slender escort of only fifty horse, directing his infantry to follow. Zafary\u00e1b Kh\u00e1n, perceiving his opportunity, ordered an attack upon Thomas; but before this could be carried out, the infantry arrived, and the mutineers, thinking the whole Marhatta army was upon them, broke and fled. The Begam was then brought out from her confinement and restored to power, whilst Zafary\u00e1b Kh\u00e1n, stripped of all his property, was reconducted as a prisoner to Dehli, where he died in 1803, and was buried beside his father in the Agra grave-yard.\n\nThe Begam paid a portion of the sum stipulated for her release to B\u00e1p\u00fa Sindhia, and promised the remainder. With the aid of George Thomas she arranged her affairs once more, and gave the command of the troops to M. Saleur, an old Frenchman, who had been in the corps since its first formation. Thomas describes the Begam at this time as small in stature, but inclined to be plump. Her complexion was fair; eyes\u2014black, large, and animated. She adopted the Hindust\u00e1n\u00ed costume made of the most costly materials. She spoke both Persian and Urd\u00fa, and in\nher conversation was engaging, sensible, and spirited. Her house was well built, and furnished partly in the European and partly in the Hindustani style; but she always followed the customs of the country, and never appeared out of doors or in her public darbar unveiled. Her officers presented themselves in front of the place where she sat, which was separated from the public rooms by a screen, and here she gave audience and transacted business of all kinds. She frequently admitted to her table the higher ranks of European officers, but natives never came within the enclosure. On dinner being announced, twenty or thirty of her female attendants, most of whom were Christians, carried in the plates and dishes, and waited on the guests during the repast.\n\nThe darker side of the Begam's character is shown by the story of the slave girl's murder. By some it is said that the girl's crime consisted in her having attracted the favourable notice of one of the Begam's husbands. Whatever may have been the offence, her barbarous mistress visited it by causing the girl to be buried alive. The time chosen for the execution was the evening, the place the tent of the Begam; who caused her bed to be arranged immediately over the grave, and occupied it until the morning, to prevent any attempt to rescue the miserable girl beneath. By acts like this the Begam inspired such terror, that she was never afterwards troubled with domestic dissensions. She augmented her troops to six battalions in 1797-98, and we next find them fighting on Sindhia's side against the English in 1802. Five battalions marched to the Dakhin, and one remained at Sardhana. At the battle of Asai, the Sardhana troops, under M. Saleur, lost one battalion and four guns. After the fall of Delhi, the Begam made submission to the British Government, and to the end of her life remained faithful to their interests. In 1825 she showed her loyalty by leading her troops in person to assist the British at Bharatpur (Bhurtore). She died in the early part of 1836. The description of the Begam's possessions and their history being purely local, will be found under the Meerut District.\n\nMention has been made of the disciplined corps entertained by Sindhia; and as the subjugation of the Duab was principally due to their presence in the Marbatta army, this seems the proper place to give some account of the regular corps in the service of the native princes that have been employed in the Duab. Sumru's brigade has already been noticed at length, from its having been connected for so many years with the Meerut District, but it never had the preponderating influence or the notoriety of DeBoigne's brigade. Benoit DeBoigne was by birth a Savoyard, and at an early age entered the Sardinian army. This he exchanged\n\n---\n\n1 Captain Lewis Ferdinand Smith, a Major in DeBoigne's corps, Captain Franklin and Captain Duff, who were all personally acquainted with DeBoigne, are the principal authorities for these notes.\nfor the Irish Brigade in France, and finally for the Russian service. He was taken prisoner in the war between Turkey and Russia, and sold as a slave by his Turkish captor. His parents procured his ransom, and he again visited Russia, where he obtained a command in the Greek archipelago. Here he met an English nobleman (Lord Percy), who gave him letters of introduction to Lord Macartney, then Governor of Madras, and Mr. Hastings, then in Bengal. In 1780 A.D. De Boigne came to Madras, and after some service there, proceeded to Bengal, where he was cordially received by Mr. Hastings, and obtained letters of introduction to the Resident at Lucknow. In 1783, De Boigne arrived in Lucknow, where he received a considerable present from the Naw\u00e1b. He then went to Agra, and entered the Raja of Jaipur's service. This came to the ears of Mr. Hastings, who immediately ordered DeBoigne to return to Calcutta. DeBoigne obeyed with alacrity, and so ingratiated himself with the Governor, that he was allowed to return to Lucknow, where he set up as a cloth merchant, with considerable success.\n\nFrom Lucknow DeBoigne again went to Agra in 1784, with Major Browne, the British envoy to the Dehli court, and there began to turn his attention to military affairs. He found that the R\u00e1n\u00e1 of Gohad was at this time closely besieged by the Marhattas under Madhoji Sindhia, and communicated a plan to the R\u00e1n\u00e1 for the relief of the fort of Gohad, which evinced much military skill, and which might eventually have been successful had not the correspondence been discovered by Sindhia. DeBoigne, disappointed at this untoward circumstance, was in despair; but what seemed to be so prejudicial to him was in reality the foundation of all his subsequent fortunes. Sindhia was so pleased with the talent and boldness shown in the plan formed by DeBoigne, that he consulted Mr. Anderson, the British Resident at his Court, in regard to taking DeBoigne into his service. The result of this was that DeBoigne obtained the command of two battalions in Sindhia's service, to be raised by himself and to be disciplined according to European tactics. These troops were attached to the force commanded by App\u00e1kandi Rao, the Marhatta chief who subsequently gave George Thomas his first command. DeBoigne's battalions participated in all the early conquests of Madhuj\u00ed Sindhia in Hindust\u00e1n and were chiefly instrumental in gaining the battles of Chaks\u00e1na and Agra in 1785 and 1786, and the battle of L\u00e1lsot in 1788. Sindhia was so pleased with this success, that he ordered DeBoigne to increase his battalions, first to ten, and subsequently to sixteen, with a train of one hundred guns. This was completed in 1790; and shortly afterwards the newly-raised force was engaged in the bloody battle of P\u00e1tan Tanwar in the\n\n---\n\n1 The Marhattas under DeBoigne, and the J\u00e1ts under M. Lestonneaux, were defeated by the Mughals, under \u00cdsmail Beg, and the Rohillas, under Ghul\u00e1m K\u00e1dir, at Ch\u00e1ksu, about five leagues from Bhartpur, April 24, 1788.\nShaikhawati country (20th June), fought against the Rahtors of Jaudhpur, who had been joined by Ismail Beg. The battle was a long and bloody one, and the enemy lost seventy pieces of cannon. They fled thence to Pipar in Jaudhpur, where another force of Rahtors were collected, and here again DeBoigne's forces were victorious (September 12th), in the equally severe battle of Mairtha.\n\nIn 1792, at Lakhairi Gh\u00e1t, in the Bundi country, DeBoigne's sepoys met a similar force, raised and disciplined by the Chevalier Dudrenee, then in the service of Tak\u00faj\u00ed Holkar. DeBoigne's troops were again successful, and Dudrenee was obliged to retreat, with the loss of nearly all his officers. The result of this battle was that Sindhia became supreme in Hindust\u00e1n. At K\u00e1nand, in the Mewati country, DeBoigne's brigades defeated the combined forces of Najf Kuli Kh\u00e1n's widow and of Ismail Beg. In 1793 DeBoigne received an assignment of lands valued at \u00a3160,000 a year, for the support of his troops, and he then formed the third brigade. By this act he made many enemies, and when his old master died, Daulat Rao Sindhi, who succeeded to power, no longer gave him the cordial support that he had hitherto received. In addition to this, his health began to fail, and he was anxious to return to his own country. He accordingly made arrangements to leave the Du\u00e1b in December, 1795, and reached Calcutta, whence he embarked for Europe. He settled down at Chamberi, in his native country, and lived there a long and useful life. Tod, Duff, Francklin, and others of our old writers on Indian history, visited him in his retreat, and there learned, from his own mouth, the particulars of his eventful life which have come down to us.\n\nDeBoigne's description of his brigades is worth transcribing:\u2014\"Each consisted of ten battalions of 750 men each, seven of which were regulars, known as talingas, clothed and armed like the troops in the service of the East India Company. The remaining three were Path\u00e1ns, armed with matchlocks manufactured at Agra. The whole brigade was manoeuvred by word of command. To each brigade was attached a force of 500 Mewatis for camp duties, 500 cavalry for patrols, and sixty well-mounted field pieces from 3 to 6 and 9-pounders. A supplementary force of 1,000 Rohillas was subsequently added to lead storming parties.\"\n\nAccording to his friend and comrade, Smith, De Boigne was a fair Latin scholar, and read and wrote English, French and Italian with ease and fluency. He had a good knowledge of the current literature of the day, and in conversation was polite, affable, pleasant, humorous and vivacious. \"He was elegant in his manners, resolute in his determinations, and firm in his measures.\" To the subtlety of the Italian he added experience gained in every school of life, and proved himself more than an equal match for Eastern politicians. He approached power in disguise, and only showed his real designs\nwhen too strong to be resisted. In the Du\u00e1b he was dreaded and idolised, feared and respected, admired and beloved. His name was enough to put down armed resistance; and from the time of his assumption of authority there were no more revolts in the portion of the Du\u00e1b under his charge. It is said that Najf Kuli Kh\u00e1n, on his deathbed, gave this parting advice to his courageous wife\u2014\"Resist, but if DeBoigne attacks you, yield.\"\n\nHis administration of justice was a fair medium between relaxation and severity, and in the conduct of business he was indefatigable. A writer in the Telegraph newspaper, in a letter, dated Agra, January 2, 1797, says of him\u2014\u201cI have seen him (DeBoigne) daily and monthly rise with the sun, survey his k\u00e1rkhdna, review his troops, enlist recruits, direct the vast movements of three brigades, raise resources, and encourage manufactures for their arms, ammunition and stores, harangu\u00e9 in the darb\u00e1r, give audience to ambassadors, administer justice, regulate the civil and revenue affairs of a j\u00e1gir of twenty lakhs of rupees, listen to a multitude of letters from various parts, on various important matters, dictate replies, carry on an intricate system of intrigue in different courts, superintend a private trade of lakhs of rupees, keep his accounts, his private and public correspondence, and direct and move forward a most complex political machine. All this he did without an European assistant, for he is very diffident in placing his confidence, and extremely cautious in bestowing his trust. He used to say that any ambitious person who reposes confidence in another, risks the destruction of his views. Such was his laborious occupation from sunrise until past midnight, and this was not the fortuitous avocation of a day, but the unremitting employment of nine or ten years. To this exhausting and unceasing toil he sacrificed one of the firmest and most robust constitutions which ever nature formed to bless mankind. He left his station with accumulated diseases, extinguished health, and a debilitated frame, but with the poor comparative recompence of uncommon fame, and a splendid fortune of \u00a3400,000. In his person he was above six feet high, giant-boned, large-limbed, strong-featured, and with piercing eyes. There was something in his countenance which depicts the hero, and compels us to yield implicit obedience. In his deportment he was commanding, and he trod with the majestic step of conscious greatness. DeBoigne, luminous as he was, had his shades; and great as he appears, had his foibles and little weaknesses;\u2014he was avaricious to a degree verging on contempt, exceedingly tenacious of power, greedy of authority, meanly jealous of merit in those under him, and unworthily envious; but where is perfection? Every officer and soldier when wounded received a certain present, in proportion to his wound, from fifteen days' to three or four months' pay, without any stoppage of pay during the time of his cure. The disabled of his army had a pension for life to the amount of half\n\n---\n\n1 Captain L. F. Smith, of the Marhatta service.\ntheir pay, and lands besides; and the relations of the killed and of those who died of their wounds, got the property of the deceased.\"\n\nAt the departure of DeBoigne there were three brigades,\u2014one at Poona, under the command of M. Perron; one at Koil, under M. Pedrono; and one at Muttra, under Major Sutherland. DeBoigne neither nominated nor recommended a successor, but Perron, being at Poona, obtained the command for himself. It is said that DeBoigne's parting advice to Sindhia was never to give the control of all these brigades to one person; and that to his successor was embodied in the clause that he introduced into his own written agreement with Sindhia\u2014\"never to fight with the English.\" Perron came out to India in the Sardine, a French frigate, in 1774, as a common sailor. Deserting thence he entered the service of several of the partisan leaders in different parts of India, and in 1789 received a commission from DeBoigne. Perron was a man of great courage, activity and industry. His attention to his duty and his personal bravery at Kanond, in 1792, induced DeBoigne to promote him to a majority; and in 1793 he was sent in charge of the first brigade to the Dakhin. He returned to Koil as Commander-in-Chief of the Du\u00e1b forces in February, 1797.\n\nThe revenue of De Boigne's districts in the Du\u00e1b had risen under his care from sixteen to over twenty lakhs of rupees a year. Perron not only received these, but added to them on all sides. He arranged and pursued a systematic plan for the aggrandisement of his possessions and fortune, and in this was so successful, that in a short time the entire country from Lahor to Kota, and from Jandhpur to Koil, acknowledged his authority. The principal obstacles to his attaining undivided influence in the Marhatta empire were Tantia Pagnavis, Lakhwa D\u00e1da and George Thomas. The first was taken prisoner and died by poison; Lakhwa D\u00e1da fell in 1801, after the fight at Datiya; and George Thomas, as we have seen, succumbed to the united battalions of all Perron's contingents, now raised to four brigades, at the close of the same year. Perron's revenues at the beginning of 1802 amounted to more than forty-one lakhs of rupees a year, from sixty-eight parganahs. At the same time a cloud began to gather in the west, and at the risk of the safety of his power, and even of his life, Perron was obliged to visit the Marhatta camp at Ujain, where he arranged matters for the time by a liberal use of money. Sindhia in the meantime was preparing to assist the Peshwa and attack Holkar, and asked for a second brigade from Perron, who, though he risked the independence, and even the existence of the Marhatta empire, delayed for his own sake for three months to send the reinforcement asked for, and then only despatched his newly-raised fourth brigade. Even this force arrived too late, as the British had already stepped in and restored the Peshwa, who had thrown himself into\ntheir hands. This so alarmed the Marhattas, that, laying aside their mutual jealousies, the Berar Raja, Holkar and Sindhia, united for a time against the English, and resolved to carry out a plan of campaign drawn up by Perron, who advised their active alliance for this purpose. But before anything could be done in pursuance of their agreement, quarrels again broke out. Holkar withdrew himself from the confederacy, and Sindhia, resolving to supersede Perron, bestowed the command of the Du\u00e1b on Amb\u00e1ji. Perron found his fourth brigade, under Dudreneec, ready to desert him. Bourquien had induced the second and third brigades to revolt, and had even written to the commanders of the irregular horse at Koil to encompass the death of Perron. Knowing all this, Perron only made a half-hearted resistance at Koil, and fled by H\u00e1thras to Muttra, where he surrendered to Lord Lake, and proceeded thence by Calcutta to Europe.\n\nBourquien, who commanded at Dehli, was put under restraint by his own troops, who met the British on the road between Aligarh and Dehli, where the Marhattas were completely defeated on the 11th September, 1803. The Prince Akbar, who had succeeded to the position of heir-apparent since the death of his eldest brother Jaw\u00e1n Bakht at Benares, in 1788, came out to meet the British Commander-in-Chief, and conducted him into the city, where he was received by the blind and aged emperor. The treaty with Sindhia, dated Surje Anjangauum, 30th December, 1803, ceded to the British all the forts, territories and rights held by the Marhattas in the Du\u00e1b and the countries to the north of the territories of the Rajas of Jaipur and Jaudhpur, and the Rana of Gohad.\n\nThough the war with Sindhia was thus brought to a successful termination in 1803, Holkar, in the following year, renewed hostilities; and, having been joined by the J\u00e1s of Bhartpur, sent a considerable force to invest Dehli, which was then in possession of a British garrison under the celebrated General Ochterlony. In 1804, Lord Lake collected stores and supplies, and set out by Muttra for Dehli. On his way he drove out Ghul\u00e1mi Kh\u00e1n, who had been plundering the Aligarh District; and Holkar retired from Muttra at the approach of the British force. Holkar's light troops accompanied the army, and hovered on the flanks all day, cutting off stragglers, whilst at night they always encamped out of reach.\n\nNear Dehli, Holkar branched off and crossed into the Du\u00e1b near B\u00e1gpat; thence he proceeded northwards by Sardhana and Sh\u00e1mli; but on being pursued by Lord Lake, left the latter place on the 3rd November, and presented himself before Fatehgarh. The civil officers retired into the fort, which, with the old cantonments, were preserved; but the cavalry lines and new cantonments, which lay beyond the ravines, and were therefore beyond the line of defence taken up by the troops, were burned by\nHolkar. Here he was surprised by General Lake on the 17th of November, and, in the words of his own historian, \"was totally defeated, with great slaughter,\" and retreated across the Jumna into Bhartpur territory, where he was joined by Amir Khan, the Pindara leader.\n\nOn the 7th February, 1805, Amir Khan crossed the Jumna at the Mahaban gh\u00e1t, with a body of horse lightly equipped, intending to create a diversion in the British rear. He plundered Gokal and relieved Kamona in the Aligarh District, then held by Dundi Khan. Thence he passed up the Du\u00e1b by P\u00e1th in the Meerut District, and crossing the Ganges at Kumr-ud-dinnagar, caused some disturbance in Rohilkhand. Driven thence by General Smith and Skinner's horse, he re-entered the Du\u00e1b at the same point, and rejoined Holkar's force before Bhartpur on the 21st March, 1805, after an absence of six weeks. General Smith followed two days afterwards. The peace of this tract was never again seriously disturbed until the outbreak of the mutiny in 1857.\n\nThe mutiny narratives of the Meerut Division abound with instances of firm devotion and unflinching bravery. As they are given in some detail under each district, it will be necessary here to make only some few general remarks on the mutiny in this division as a whole, and this cannot be better done than by giving Mr. Fleetwood Williams' summary of the origin and progress of the rebellion in the Meerut Division.\u00b9\n\nHe writes\u2014\"That the rebellion had been planned by the Musalm\u00e1ns, I have no doubt. It is not the province of a local officer to trace this, but one or two indications may be mentioned. Though there was no apparent sympathy, the idea of the restoration of the Musalm\u00e1n religion to power has been repeatedly kept alive. Invitations to join in a war against infidels, emanating from the Sw\u00e1t country, have circulated through the upper part of Hindust\u00e1n. The anxiety of the Rohilkhand Path\u00e1ns, particularly the members of the family of H\u00e1d\u00ed Rahmat Kh\u00e1n, that Government should not suffer anarchy and oppression to continue in Oudh, but should interfere and introduce the just administration with which they were blessed, seemed at the time to be the loyal desires of enlightened men. Late events show that they anticipated the long-hoped-for opportunity which the cry of annexation and the decreased importance of the native soldiers in Oudh, under British rule, afforded. The march of the mutineers from Meerut to the arrival at Dehli might be the policy of soldiers, but the re-exaltation of the Mughal king, and the immediate submission of the Hindu sepoys to the head of the Musalm\u00e1ns, had a deeper source. The recorded conversation, in March, 1857, of the Bijnaur Naw\u00e1b and his friends\u2014\u201cIs there any security now for Isl\u00e1m?\u201d and that \u201cIsl\u00e1m was form-\n\n\u00b9 Narrative of Events, 406 of 1858, dated November 15, 1858, paras. 425, et seq., by F. Williams, C.S.I., of the Civil Service, Commissioner of Meerut.\nerly the dominant religion,' is a specimen of the movement among the Muhammadans. An earlier conversation than this could be traced, I believe, between one of the family of H\u00e1fi\u1e93 Rahmat Kh\u00e1n and a Rajp\u00fat in Rohilkhand, in or about December, 1856, when the Path\u00e1n recommended the Th\u00e1kur to look to his weapons, as he would be wanting them soon.\n\n\"The tone of the Muhammadan portion of the native press, and the readiness with which, not the impoverished and discontented only, but the well-to-do Muhammadans in every rank and station staked their all upon the issue, and, with few exceptions, joined in rebellion; their extraordinary association with 'idolaters' to exterminate 'the children of the book,' in opposition to the laws of their prophets, and the fatwas of the few Maulvis who dared to speak out; even the exceptional loyalty of that portion of the Muhammadans whose views on the matter of proselytism differ from those of the majority; the happily unavailing endeavours of the Muhammadan leaders to make the mass of the population join them; and the bitter complaints of the Hindu mutineers, that they had been deeply deceived; all these indicate that, though a spirit of mutiny may have prepared the native army, the real movers were Muhammadans. Even at Meerut the first move was made by Muhammadans. A Hindu said he had fired off the new cartridges, and that all would have to do it. But two Muhammadans spread the story about cow's and pig's fat being used in greasing the cartridges, saying that all would be polluted; that it did not so much matter for the Muhammadans, since they could remove the pollution, but the Hind\u00fas would irrecoverably lose caste; and at the instigation of these Muhammadans, the troopers of both sects bound themselves by an oath not to use them. There is no doubt that all the native soldiers retired from the parade when their comrades were disgraced, muttering 'mutiny.' The rumours that the Europeans were coming to seize the magazine, which issued from the Suddur Bazar, and on which the sepoys rushed to arms, may have been an accident or mistake. But that there were secret agents, and those Muhammadans, watching, if not guiding events, it seems impossible in this part of the country to doubt.\n\n\"The mutiny was apparently unpremeditated, yet the Suddur Bazar people were ready before a shot was fired in Cantonments. General disloyalty of the Musalm\u00e1ns. The outbreak immediately assumed a Muhammadan character; a holy war against the infidels (the Europeans and Christians) was proclaimed; and eventually, in the Upper Du\u00e1b and in Rohilkhand, the mass of the Muhammadan population rose against Government. I believe that in Rohilkhand the Naw\u00e1b of R\u00e1mpur, and a few of his own trusted friends, and the Naw\u00e1b's own trusted personal attendants; in Bijnaur, the Deputy Collector and Sadr Amin; Wil\u00e1yat Husain Kh\u00e1n in Mor\u00e1dabad; the family of Hak\u00edm\nKh\u00e1n and Bash\u00edr Kh\u00e1n in Pilibhit; Muhammad Nur Kh\u00e1n in Sh\u00e1hjahanpur, and a few Government officials, were the only Musalm\u00e1ns who from the first stood out for Government.\n\nIn Saharanpur it was remarked that the extensive risings were attributed entirely to the influential Muhammadans. In Muzaffarnagar is a class of Sayyids who do not go the lengths Muhammadans generally do in matters of proselytism by the sword. These Sayyids even were warned, but their loyalty was happily fixed by remonstrances conveyed to them by some of their headmen; and though in this district the Muhammadans were late in rising against Government, eventually a vast multitude gathered under the 'green flag,' and displayed the bitterest animosity,\u2014massacreing in their mosque men of their own religion, after the most solemn promises of safety, because they were faithful to their rulers. In Meerut, though there were some good exceptions, Muhammadans were generally ill-disposed, and most joined in the rebellion. In the whole district of Bulandshahr, I can only bring to mind one exception, that of the family\\(^1\\) of Mur\u00e1d Ali Kh\u00e1n, of Chat\u00e1ri and Pah\u00e1su, who took the side they had taken in Lord Lake's time,\u2014that of the British Government. Everywhere in this part of the North-Western Provinces, as a general rule, the antagonism of the Musalm\u00e1ns showed itself in every place, from the open rebellion of multitudes, to the scowling impertinence of individuals; from the public proclamations of rebel leaders, to the muttered imprecatious of bigots in the mosques. The very fact that the few who shone out as loyal subjects or merciful men were stigmatized as Christians, infidels, apostates from the true faith, should show what the belief and feeling of the Indian Musalm\u00e1n is. There was a marked difference between the conduct of Muhammadans and other rebels in this part of India. The first warred against Government and Europeans, the others plundered. The first, from the beginning and throughout, abstained from injuring the inhabitants of the country, assured them in order to win them to Muhammadan rule, and urged them to join against Government. The plundering tribes, almost the only Hind\u00fas who in these parts decidedly and thoroughly misbehaved, turned their hands against every one that had property,\u2014their enemies and creditors first. The Mawai J\u00e1ts of the Barant parganah, in the Meerut District, were almost the only Hind\u00fas who showed unmitigated disloyalty, and they were urged to it by a notorious bad character, S\u00e1h Mal. The Gujars even were in some instances against us, and sometimes took the side of Government. Vast numbers even of these plundering tribes, who bear Hindu names\u2014Gujars, Rajp\u00fats, Tagas, &c.\u2014are Muhammadans, forced proselytes when the power was paramount in Delhi, and, like all such proselytes, intensely bigoted. It was not a national movement against Government.\n\n\\(^1\\) Converted Hind\u00fas of the Badg\u00fajar clan.\n\"With the exception of the immediate neighbourhood of Meerut, it was generally sometime before Government offices and Government property were attacked. In Saharanpur, the towns of Deoband and Nakur were plundered, and of course the Government offices in them were not exempted. A mob collected to attack the treasury at Saharanpur, but was easily dispersed. These were the only instances in which extensive plundering assumed the type of rebellion. Muzaffarnagar must be treated as an exception. The best disposed populace in this world have been tempted to let loose the innate wickedness of human nature by disappearance of all authority. In Meerut the widely-spread report that all the Europeans had been destroyed (which was not contradicted, as it should have been by their appearance in every direction); the uninterrupted passage of the Bareilly mutineer brigade; the total surrender of the Bulandshahr District to Walidad Khan, who should have been seized by a small force, and hung within three days of his breaking out into open rebellion; the propinquity of Delhi, and the constant hope of assistance from the mutineer force there; by which concatenation of circumstances every bad character in the district was encouraged to evil, induced a tendency to rebellion, which was favoured by the retention in the lines of the troops who ought to have been enforcing order and checking insurrection. But even in this and in the Bulandshahr District, till, in the latter, the refusal of aid from Meerut, the approach of mutineers from below, and the hope of rescuing the prisoners that the district officers had made, incited the people to it, the outbreak was characterized by aggressions of the lawless part of the population on the better conditioned,\u2014the prevalence of crime, in consequence of a conviction that authority had ceased, rather than by rebellion against the State. The last offence, as a general rule, spread among the people slowly, as delay at Delhi brought conviction that the British power was passing away, and even then only broke out here and there, when notorious bad characters, flushed by success in plundering, led their followers to greater enterprizes.\n\n\"The normal state of the ordinary mass of the people, i.e., those not either Muhammadans or thieves, was waiting events; and their conduct depended on the amount of their good sense or their credulity. There were some who from the first felt that, though the few Englishmen in India might be crushed for the time, an overwhelming British force would come out to reconquer the country and take vengeance on the traitors. These were the few. There were some who believed the false or exaggerated rumours circulated by the rebels, and hastened to separate from the foreigners, and secure favour from the native rulers. These were more in numbers than the first class considerably; but still the many wavered between the two extremes. But all feared,\u2014all were employed in an anxious...\"\nendeavour to ascertain what would be their own individual interest; the unfailing consideration of the natives of Hindustan. This their sole consideration, and cowardice, both moral and physical, made mutineers of half the native army, and a percentage of the population, (the said percentage fluctuating according to circumstances, but never very large,) rebels. Had there been European soldiers and non-commissioned and commissioned officers to the extent of ten per cent. in each native regiment, a nucleus for good men to fall back upon, with a firm front to face the fire of mutineers, half the men of the mutinous regiments would not have gone, and half the regiments in the service would have stood staunch to their duty; but bodily fear and mental weakness, the absence of all principles of the all-controlling sense of duty, and a dastardly dread of being killed, made well-intentioned men follow the majority of their comrades, and peaceable subjects seek safety in disaffection. Those who have lived in the midst of it, and who should be the best judges, cannot but feel that the theory that it was a purely military revolt; and the other, it was a national effort to shake off tyrants, are equally far from the truth. Had not the mass of the people awaited the issue, had any large proportion of them joined, what would have become of the small but gallant bands that in different parts of the country stood out against their active enemies, may be concluded from\n\n| Population | Troops |\n|------------|--------|\n| Saharanpur  | 801,325 |\n| Muzaffarnagar | 679,661 |\n| Meerut      | 1,135,072 |\n\nthe marginal table, showing in round numbers the population of the districts of this division, and the strength of the troops which maintained Government authority. Neither can people on the spot be persuaded to believe that efforts to Christianize the natives led to rebellion. Had this been the case, how is it that Benares, the largest city in India, to Hind\u00fas the holiest, and where Muhammadan bigotry is sharpened by its peculiar position, the place where missionaries have worked more extensively than in any part of India, where the Bible is openly studied and read by hundreds of students in many schools, did not send some of its 180,000 to save the mutineer brigade from the 200 British soldiers.\n\n\"Beyond all doubt the secret movers of the revolt disseminated widely the wildest and most false reports that Government was going forcibly to convert the people; and during the outbreak these rumours were spread abroad to such an extent, that many ignorant men believed them, and, when peace was restored, some have stated their readiness to become Christians, and were astonished when told that no man could make another a Christian. But here, round Meerut, where the mutiny commenced, missionaries have been more successful in one year than they had ever been; and I have been told by a native deserving of all confidence, that in Bareilly, Muhammadans and Hind\u00fas agreed that to be all of one, and that the\nChristian religion, would be better than to be exposed to the tyranny of Kh\u00e1n Bah\u00e1dur Kh\u00e1n, and his following of miscreants. It is difficult to believe that the efforts of Government to give education to the people can have caused the mutiny and rebellion, when in some districts, the only public institutions maintained during the anarchy, where doctors were driven out, and dispensaries were destroyed, were village schools; the only public buildings saved were village school-rooms; and the people, when asked to account for this, stated their intentions to have maintained their schools, even if the rule of India had changed hands. During the outbreak, as far as experience goes, the most loyal, the most trustworthy, were young men who had received an advanced English education in the Government institutions. I have known such, of the writer class, not a fighting race generally, become brave, soldiery men; I have seen English letters from such men, the matter and composition of which would have done credit to any Englishman, written from the midst of fanatic rebels, conveying full and useful information, openly and boldly given, though the writer stated he knew he was suspected and watched, and immediate death would be the certain result of discovery. The only approach to the sense of duty which has animated Anglo-Saxons through this struggle was to be found among such educated men.\" I have nothing to add to this account, and the district narratives will speak for themselves.\n\nThe medical history of the division shows a steady increase in sickness of late years, much of which has been traced to preventible causes, such as bad drainage, bad sanitation, and inattention to the most ordinary precautions for the preservation of health. Taking the three principal diseases\u2014cholera, small-pox and fever, the following facts may be gathered from the reports in regard to the frequency and virulence of their attacks. Cholera broke out in 1867 amongst the pilgrims returning from the Hardwar fair, and, strange to say, seems to have very generally restricted itself to those who had been at the fair, and not to have shown itself out of the line of march of the pilgrims. Though deaths from cholera occur at all times of the year in almost every district, yet cholera seldom becomes epidemic in the Upper D\u00fa\u00e1b. During the epidemic of 1869, the deaths hardly reached more than 0\u00b72 per thousand, whilst in Allahabad and the Benares Divisions, they rose from 2\u00b71 per thousand in Allahabad, up to 10\u00b79 per thousand in Lal\u00edtpur. During this year cholera was absent in the hill districts altogether, and little prevalent in those lying immediately under the hills, increasing in intensity to the south. The actual number of deaths attributed to cholera during 1869, in the five districts noticed in the present volume, was 1497; in 1870 and in 1871 the numbers were merely nominal; and in 1872 there was a slight outbreak of cholera.\n\n---\n\n1 Dr. Cutcliffe's report on the sanitation of the Meerut Division, II; Sel. Rec. Government, North-Western Provinces, 15; Dr. Planck on the same, Reports for 1869\u201472.\nin the Saharanpur District; but the full force of the epidemic was felt, as before, chiefly in the southern districts.\n\nSmall-pox, amongst preventible diseases, carries off more victims than all the rest put together, except fever. The deaths recorded from this cause for some years are shown below. In 1868 it can hardly be said to have existed in an epidemic form, though the mortality was so great; but there is no contagion so strong and sure, or so far reaching, as that of small-pox, and perhaps no disease is more fatal. In 1869, the disease was epidemic in several districts, and prevalent in almost all. It seems to commence as an epidemic during the cold-weather, and rages with intensity during March, April and May, after which it gradually subsides with the setting in of the rains. The Upper Doab and Rohilkhand, in exchange for their practical immunity from cholera, have, by comparison, almost a monopoly of small-pox, which is not nearly so prevalent in the cholera districts of the Lower Doab and the Benares Division. From 1870 to 1872, the upper districts suffered excessively when compared with any other district except Basti. The vaccination statistics and details are shown under the district notices.\n\nIt is to fever, however, that the greatest mortality is due, and inquiries go to show that the deaths from fevers have gone on in an increasing ratio for several years. In 1867 the attention of Government was called to the abnormal proportion of deaths attributed to this disease in the Meerut Division, and Dr. Cutcliffe was appointed as Sanitary Commissioner to inquire into the causes, and propose a remedy. Doctor Planck was employed on similar duty during subsequent years. Before making use of their remarks, I will give a comparative table, for all five districts, of the causes of death for the years for which any statistics exist.\n\n| District       | Population (as 1865) | Small-pox | Fevers | All other causes | Small-pox | Fevers | All other causes | Small-pox | Fevers | All other causes |\n|----------------|----------------------|-----------|--------|-----------------|-----------|--------|-----------------|-----------|--------|-----------------|\n| Saharanpur     | 986,463              | 1,194      | 4,053  | 6,647            | 3,176     | 3,101  | 6,577            | 1,106     | 1,189  | 6,004            |\n| Muzaffarnagar  | 882,139              | 982       | 6,104  | 7,287            | 2,348     | 4,131  | 6,474            | 1,074     | 10,841 | 6,475            |\n| Meerut         | 1,190,593            | 914       | 10,287 | 8,653            | 891       | 8,625 | 5,975            | 4,984     | 4,984  | 4,811            |\n| Bulandshahr    | 800,481              | 2,358     | 4,854  | 2,877            | 1,338     | 5,769  | 5,964            | 6,240     | 6,650  | 4,085            |\n| Allgarh        | 925,538              | 436       | 6,086  | 4,098            | 1,938     | 5,603 | 2,861            | 6,440     | 6,668  | 3,849            |\n| Total          | 4,474,284            | 5,707     | 31,984 | 29,681           | 10,090    | 31,197 | 23,130           | 19,953    | 44,679 | 25,021           |\n\n| Year          | Small-pox | Fevers | All other causes | Small-pox | Fevers | All other causes |\n|---------------|-----------|--------|-----------------|-----------|--------|-----------------|\n| 1867          | 1,277     | 10,906 | 18,485           | 1,277     | 10,906 | 18,485           |\n| 1868          | 1,968     | 10,855 | 18,221           | 1,968     | 10,855 | 18,221           |\n| 1869          | 2,318     | 20,293 | 22,611           | 2,318     | 20,293 | 22,611           |\n| 1870          | 1,685     | 11,464 | 13,049           | 1,685     | 11,464 | 13,049           |\n| 1871          | 519       | 6,659  | 9,131            | 519       | 6,659  | 9,131            |\nThese figures show conclusively the extent and gravity of the epidemic.\n\nDr. Kirton, of Muzaffarnagar, pronounces the fever prevalent in the Upper Du\u00e1b to be \u201ca true malarious fever of intermittent type,\u2014such a fever, indeed, as is generally attributed to effluvia arising from alluvial soil saturated by moisture. The attacks were characterised by distinct paroxysms, consisting of a cold and hot stage, followed by periods of intermission. The paroxysms mostly occurred daily, but frequently every other day.\u201d Dr. J. P. Walker, writing of R\u00farki in 1867, calls it \u201cintermittent fever.\u201d Dr. Drysdale, of Her Majesty\u2019s 79th Highlanders, describes the fever that prevailed in his regiment at R\u00farki as \u201cintermittent fever in a spurious form.\u201d Dr. Metcalfe, of Sah\u00e1ranpur, says of the fever that it was \u201cundoubtedly malarious in its character, subject to relapses, but not often when quinine had been given sufficiently early and in sufficiently large doses.\u201d The fever, as a rule, commences in July-August, and ends about December. In many cases the protracted fever brought on diarrhoea, which accompanied nearly all the fatal cases, and might possibly lead to the supposition that typhoid fever either co-existed with malarious fever in some of the towns, or that the prevailing fever was a hybrid variety between malarious and typhoid fever. Dr. Cutcliffe, however, thought that all his inquiries pointed \u201cto a common local cause of origin of the disease, and led strongly to the belief that the cases which occurred were varieties of one and the same endemic disease,\u2014malarious fever.\u201d Dr. Planck, in 1869-72, gives it the same character.\n\nBesides the deaths due to fever and the utter prostration occasioned by continuous attacks of the disease, one of its most remarkable effects is the causing of impotency. Dr. Cutcliffe first pointed this out in 1867, and expressed his opinion \u201cthat impotency is extraordinarily frequent in the most malarious tracts;\u201d\n\n---\n\n1 See his observations on the true character of malaria and effluvia in Sel. Rec. Gov., N.W.P. II., N. S. 65.\nand, again, \"of this fact I convinced myself, by the frequent applications that were made to me, that the men inhabiting the very malarious tracts which I have described are suffering from impotency, to an extent which I have never known or heard of elsewhere.\" Dr. Planck's attention was specially drawn to the same subject, and he writes\u2014\"Concerning the general prevalence of impotency, I am of opinion that that condition is more than usually common in some places of the Saharanpur District, as a result of the general debility arising from repeated fever attacks; but I do not think it is a condition so common as to threaten to lead to a depopulation of the country. I think this condition exists principally in those who are about to succumb to fever disease, and whose spleens are much enlarged; but I do not think that, as a rule, it affects men in the prime of life for many years before they die.\" Still, in 51 villages examined by him in the Saharanpur District alone, he found in four villages that enlargement of the spleen was very common; that in four villages it was rather common; in fifteen villages it was common; and in the remaining villages, thirty-one cases were seen, and this too by an observer marching continuously throughout, and unable to examine others than those voluntarily brought to him, and who happened to be present when he visited their villages. These include both irrigated and unirrigated villages. In eighteen irrigated villages in the Muzaffarnagar District he found enlargement of the spleen\u2014very common, in four villages; common, in the same number; uncommon in six; and nonexistent in two, in one of which the site was raised and sandy, and in the other the site was low, but here the spring-level was 24 feet from the surface. It is very strange to see that in places where the site was clean there was more mortality than where it was very filthy; but I frequently notice this remark added\u2014\"much stagnant water near.\" In fifteen unirrigated villages in the same district the returns show\u2014in two cases, no spleen enlargement; in one case it was very uncommon; in nine cases, uncommon; and in only three cases common; and these three lie within the N\u00e1gal kh\u00e1dir, with a spring-level varying from only six to eight feet from the surface. It has been a painful task to go through the records of these fever-stricken villages, and read the constant remarks \"many persons afflicted with spleen, especially children; coughs and ophthalmia common; a general complaint of sickness was heard here\"\u2014\"people very unhealthy looking\"\u2014\"fourteen houses, only two children left, used to have many, now dead?\"\u2014\"paralysis, a result of fever, much complained of, and some cases of it seen\"\u2014\"one-half the people down with fever in the rains\"\u2014\"an earnest cry for remedies?\"\u2014\"people in low spirits and despondent.\" Enough has been said to show that this fever is a serious matter, which, though it carries off only three in every hundred every year, yet so wastes the energies of the survivors, as to render them unable to carry on their work of life as cultivators of the ground. The sub-division of the soil yields little enough to the labour of the\nman who can work his full tide, but if to this be added the utter prostration of the bread-winner of the family, it needs no words of mine to paint the distress which must ensue in thousands of families amongst the inhabitants of the northern districts of the Upper Du\u00e1b.\n\nThe fever being of a malarious type is undoubtedly due to the miasma evolved from over-saturation of the soil. In proportion to the intensity of the miasma we have the disease \"in the formidable remittent type, and from the slight ague and fever, which scarcely shakes a strong man, to the pukka jungle fever which, if it should not kill outright, will necessitate a prolonged change of climate for the recovery of a body impaired for the remainder of its existence.\" To the north of the Saharanpur District fever prevailed to a much greater extent in former times, especially about Kheri and Sakrunda, and along the line to Mohand. The improvement here is undoubtedly due to the clearing of jungle and the extension of cultivation. Lower south the disease may be traced along those places where the drainage lines are naturally slow, or have been impeded by artificial obstructions, such as the canal lines and the railway embankments. The towns and villages along the Ganges Canal, from Manglaur southwards, suffered very much, but many of these, such as Manglaur, Libarberi, P\u00far, Bhainsw\u00e1l and Jauli, are so filthy, that it is no wonder that they have been frequently attacked by fevers. Dr. Cutcliffe describes them as \"reeking with human excrement and filth of every description.\" R\u00farki, too, was unhealthy in 1867, and so also were the tracts along the Kalandar Nadi, K\u00e1tha Nadi, Kh\u00e1la, S\u00edla, and Krishni Nad\u00eds, all slow streams, running through swampy, ill-drained depressions. The same may be said of parts of the West Kali Nadi, the old bed of the Jumna, the Eastern Jumna Canal, and in the vicinity of these streams and the khaddir of the Ganges. All these places, covered with swamp and stagnant water, are prolific sources of malaria, which they must disengage in large quantities. Drainage, and the enforcement of a greater economy in the use of canal water, could to a great extent prevent the evolution of malaria in these tracts. For the khaddir of the Ganges and Jumna rivers it has been proposed to plant a belt of trees along the high bank separating them from the uplands, in order to intercept the malaria borne from them by the easterly and westerly winds,\u2014a plan which experience elsewhere has shown to be valuable and feasible. These means, with the supply of the only reliable antidote, quinine, and more attention to conservancy, are the principal remedial measures recommended by Dr. Cutcliffe. The canals form so important a feature in the hydrography of the Du\u00e1b, that their influence on the public health demands a separate and more detailed notice.\n\nIn 1845 a committee was appointed to report upon the sanitary effects of the Influence of the canals canal. The sittings were interrupted by the Sikh war, on the public health. but were renewed in 1846, and their report was sub-\nmitted to the Governor-General at R\u00farki in March, 1847. In writing on this subject, Major P. T. Cautley remarks:\u2014\"In referring to the low tracts of the Du\u00e1b, and especially to those situated in the Fatehpur District, my attention has been drawn, during the last two years especially, to an opinion which has been prevalent, that wherever lines of canal exist in these provinces the germs of malaria and sickness hold undisputed authority. Without producing proofs, that are numerous, that the epidemics which have shown themselves in towns and villages near the canals have been equally felt at others far removed from the influence of either canals or of irrigation, it is natural to infer that the introduction of moisture and excess of vegetation on the surface of countries which had been comparatively dry before, must necessarily lead to a change of climate. That change must necessarily demand an alteration in the habits of the people subjected to its influence.\" This alteration has not taken place,\u2014the same light clothing is worn, the same habit of sleeping on the ground and working in the night air is continued, and to this Major Cautley attributed much of the illness. In 1843, R\u00e1mpur, Sah\u00e1r\u00e1npur and Sh\u00e1mli were afflicted with malarious fevers, whilst the notoriously unhealthy jungle tracts to the north were left untouched. Similarly, sickness supposed to be due to the presence of canals was found to be prevalent in places where there were no canals and no irrigation. A report from the Meerut District, in calling for medical aid for the population on the canal banks, shows the feeling of the district officers. At that time the only canal in the district was the Eastern Jumna Canal, which irrigated a small strip of land between the Karsuni and the Jumna. In 1843 there was sickness in this tract as well as all over the district. It was as rife at Begamabad, 23 miles east of the canal, as in parganah Loni on its banks, Murd\u00ednagar, and other large towns which had no connection with the canal, suffered in a precisely similar way, yet aid was only asked for the canal tract, based on the foregone conclusion of a connection between the sickness and the canals.\n\nThe results arrived at by the Sanitary Committee of 1843 show that there was an epidemic in 1843, which was generally, though not universally, more severely felt in the canal tracts than elsewhere. In places totally unconnected with the canal, fevers prevailed to an extent and with an intensity as great as in the worst canal villages. Much of the evils complained of were due to bad drainage, the natural drainage being checked and impeded, and the soils being stiff and retentive of moisture. The Committee recommended the stoppage of irrigation within five miles of large towns, and that certain sanitary arrangements should be carried out in the villages, as, on the whole, the influence of irrigation was very local. They found that the Eastern Jumna Canal furnished some of the best and worst results of canal irrigation!\u2014sick-\n\n---\n\n1 Ganges Canal, I, 67.\nness where the drainage had been obstructed and where the soil was clayey, as in the centre division; health where the drainage was perfect and the soil light, as in the northern and southern divisions. Or, in other words, the Committee of 1843 found that the salubrity or otherwise of the canal depended on the nature of the soil and the efficiency of the surface drainage. The Committee summed up their recommendations as follows:\u20141. That the canal should be kept, as far as possible, to the ordinary level of the country; 2, that earth, when required for embankments, should never be obtained from excavations made outside the canal without proper precautions being taken for drainage; 3, that the canal should be taken along the watershed, so as to interfere as little as possible with natural drainage lines, which, when intercepted, should be relieved; 4, masonry drains should be constructed under distributary channels and bridge ramps, where these cross natural lines of drainage; 5, no private water-courses should be allowed; 6, irrigation should be prohibited within five miles of large towns; 7, grass and weeds should not be allowed to lie and rot, but should be burned; and 8, irrigation should be altogether prohibited in localities which appear naturally to possess a malarious character.\n\nDr. Cutcliffe pursued the same line of inquiry in his researches into the causes of the epidemic of 1867. He found that the water-level all round had been greatly raised by the introduction of canal-irrigation, and that this had been effected as well by the increase to the natural water-resources caused by the volume of water thrown over the country by the canal, as by the supercession of wells in irrigation, which carried up the water from the sub-soil and distributed it over the surface of the ground, where much was lost by evaporation. In addition, this raising of the spring-level had made the water in many of the wells unfit for use, as well by the liquefaction of the salts that lie in such abundance at no great distance from the surface of the ground, as by coming sooner in contact with the animal and vegetable impurities which an absence of any attempt at sanitation allows to accumulate within the site of every village, and often close to the wells used for drinking water. At the same time that sickness was general along the Ganges Canal from Manglaur to Meerut, and along the Jumna Canal as far as Baraut, it was noticed again that the attacks were more frequent and virulent in the neighbourhood of swamps; and where these occurred at a distance from the canals the sickness was equally felt. In villages, whether close to the canal, or even in the beds of streams where there was proper and efficient natural or artificial drainage, fever was unknown. In Meerut, Sardhana alone showed any unusual sickness, and in Bulandshahr, the town of Galauthi suffered severely. In the latter place the sickness was correctly attributed to the undue collection of stagnant water around the village site, and with proper drainage arrangements the fever disappeared.\nDr. Planck in 1869-70 travelled over the greater portion of the Muzaffarnagar District, and in 1871 examined the Saharanpur District; the results of his investigations are the same as those already arrived at by his predecessors;\u2014excessive irrigation raising the spring-level in canal-irrigated tracts, and no means taken to improve existing lines of drainage; or, where the natural lines were impeded by the canal works, no new ones were formed, hence excessive moisture, the destruction of the wells, and the defilement of the drinking water. In tracts removed from the direct influence of the canal, the same cause\u2014bad drainage\u2014was at work. It would be unduly lengthening this notice to recapitulate the details given by Dr. Planck. He corroborates the opinion of the Committee of 1845, that the epidemics which now annually desolate the Upper Doab are due to insufficient drainage, enhanced in canal-irrigated tracts by the action of the canal in raising the spring-level, and yet to the present time very little has been done to remedy this evil; and, as I have shown, of late years it has been increasing in a ratio which bids fair to assume gigantic proportions. Whilst money is being liberally expended to meet the possible chances of a famine in Bengal, men are dying in thousands from a disease which is preventible by the exercise of more careful supervision in the expenditure of canal-water, and the construction of drainage lines to carry off excessive moisture.\n\nOne result certainly followed upon the reports of the Sanitary Commissioners, and this was the assembling of a conference of canal officers at Meerut in November, 1870, when it was resolved \"that a survey of the districts concerned should be undertaken by the Engineers of the Department, working in conjunction with the civil authorities, for the express purpose of determining how the natural drainage channels of the country could be made more efficient. That wherever, in the districts concerned, the spring-level of the sub-soil water was at any time of the year less than ten or twelve feet from the surface, there canal-irrigation should cease or be checked.\" The survey was carried out during the cold-weather, but the same facts of the existence of fever far away from canal-irrigated tracts led the canal officers to doubt whether the fever had anything to do with canal irrigation. Dr. Planck again visited the Muzaffarnagar District, and found, as before, that the fever prevails in tracts unirrigated by the canal as well as in canal-irrigated tracts. He writes\u2014\"Second.\u2014This fact appeared, that the form of fever with which we have to deal is more persistent in its prevalence, more virulent, and therefore more fatal in its results, in the canal-irrigated country than in the country not irrigated by the canal, unless the latter should be naturally a very moist country. Third.\u2014This fact appears, that filthiness is common to all the villages, and cannot, therefore, be the cause of the prevalence of ague; otherwise it should prevail equally in all the places inspected, and the people\nshould all have the same unhealthy aspect. Fourth.\u2014This fact appears, that the most unhealthy people of all are those who live in places naturally moist, the moisture of which has been increased by canal-irrigation,\u2014in low land irrigated from the Jumna Canal, and in the N\u00e1gal kh\u00e1dir. Considering these facts, one may justly arrive at the opinion that ague has not been introduced as a new thing into the canal-irrigated country, but that its area and period of prevalence, and its intensity of attack, have very greatly increased since irrigation from the canals was introduced;\u2014this prevalence and intensity being very fairly measurable by the increased moisture of the soil, and consequently of the atmosphere, denoted by the height of permanent rise in the spring-level at any given place,\u2014a rise which no man can doubt must be due to canal-irrigation.\u201d Having ascertained by repeated inquiries the connection between bad drainage, whether directly connected with canals or not, and malaria, the canal officers and the district authorities have, at last, prepared large schemes for the improvement of the drainage of the Upper Du\u00e1b. Amongst these may be mentioned the drainage of the town of Sah\u00e1r\u00e1npur, the improvement of the drainage of the P\u00e1ndhoi and Dumaula rivers, the deepening and straightening of the cut on the S\u00edla Kh\u00e1la, and the removal of the impediments to the drainage passing down by the Krishni and K\u00e1tha n\u00e1dis. The Chief Engineer informs me that, altogether, the sum of one lakh of rupees a year has been set aside to improve drainage lines of the canal-irrigated tracts. Several of these projects have been taken in hand, and have already had a marked effect in improving the health of the people; but much remains to be done; and before the Irrigation Department can really take credit for the saving of lives in seasons of drought, this annual waste of life from bad drainage must be met and remedied.\nSAHARANPUR DISTRICT.\n\nCONTENTS.\n\n| Part I.                  | Page |\n|--------------------------|------|\n| Boundaries, area         | 180  |\n| Parganah changes         | 132  |\n| Siwalik hills            | 186  |\n| Geology                  | ib.  |\n| Uplands and lowlands     | 141  |\n| Soils                    | 143  |\n| Elevation                | 145  |\n| Rivers                   | ib.  |\n| Canals, navigation       | 152  |\n| Communications           | 153  |\n| Climate and rain-fall    | 154  |\n\n| Part II.                 |      |\n|--------------------------|------|\n| Animals of the district  | 156  |\n| Horses                   | 158  |\n| Principal crops          | 159  |\n| Cost of production       | 160  |\n| Agriculture              | 161  |\n| Irrigation               | ib.  |\n| Cultivated area          | 166  |\n| Cotton, rice, cane       | 167  |\n| Floods                   | ib.  |\n| Famines                  | 168  |\n| Botanical gardens        | 171  |\n| Building materials       | 175  |\n\n| Part III.                | Page |\n|---------------------------|------|\n| Population                | 176  |\n| Castes                    | 180  |\n| G\u00fajars                   | 183  |\n| Occupations, houses       | 189  |\n| Religion, Missions        | 191  |\n| Education, Post-office    | 192  |\n| Jails, Police             | 195  |\n| Infanticide               | 196  |\n| Old families              | 197  |\n| Landhaura Mukarari        | 199  |\n| Fiscal history            | 206  |\n| Proprietors, jungle grants| 222  |\n| Cultivating classes, labourers | 224 |\n| Distribution of produce   | 227  |\n| Rents and rent-rates      | 229  |\n| Alienations               | 231  |\n| Selling price of land     | 232  |\n| Wages, prices             | 234  |\n| Trade, manufactures       | 235  |\n| R\u00farki Workshops           | 237  |\n| Thomason College          | 239  |\n| Revenue from all sources  | 240  |\n| History                   | 245  |\n| Medical History           | 267  |\n\nGazetteer of the District ... 258\n\nSAHARANPUR, the most northerly district of the D\u00fa\u00e1b, has somewhat the form of a great triangle, with its apex to the north-west.

R. C. Williams, CS.; the Settlement Reports of Messrs. Van Agnew, Robertson, Wynne and Webster; Caulley's Ganges Canal; the Sanitary Reports of Doctors Catcliffe and Planck; and the records of the Board of Revenue in Allahabad.\n\n\u00b2 The census of 1868 gives a total area of 2,165.45 square miles; that of 1858 gives 2,159.8; Mr. Plowden, in 1865, gives 2,227 square miles; and the last census shows 2,217 square miles. The Settlement Reports give 2,219.05 square miles, and this estimate has been followed here. In fact, from the inclusion in some accounts, and the exclusion in others, of the jungle tracts, it is impossible to give the total area correctly. The total area in 1866, as shown by the Board's review of the Saharanpur Settlement, amounts to 1,081,763 acres, or 1,890.2 square miles, for the revenue-paying area. The total area is elsewhere given at 2,227 square miles, without details.\nUnder the Dehli Emperors, Sirk\u00e1r Sah\u00e1ranpur contained thirty-six mah\u00e1ls, divided into four dast\u00fars, viz., Deoband, Kair\u00e1na, Sardhana and Indri, and included the Du\u00e1b from the Siw\u00e1l\u00edk hills to the middle of the Moerut District, as well as portions of the tract to the west of the Jumna, now included in the Panj\u00e1b. Nineteen of these mah\u00e1ls lay within the modern district of Sah\u00e1ranpur. These were increased to twenty-four at the time of the settlement under Regulation VII. of 1822, in the year 1839-40. The revision of Mr. Edgeworth in 1842 absorbed nine parganahs, and that of Mr. A. Ross, in 1855, absorbed three more, whilst three others were created, leaving fifteen parganahs, as at present, distributed amongst the four tahsils of Sah\u00e1ranpur, Deoband, R\u00farki and Nakf\u00e1r. The relative area of these tahsils is 25\u00b71, 22\u00b78, 26\u00b78 and 25\u00b73 per cent. of the total area respectively.\n\nTo understand references to Sah\u00e1ranpur local history, it is necessary to give some account of each of these changes. The following table traces the history of the nineteen mah\u00e1ls existing\n\n| Present Tahsil | Farganah | Entered in the Ain-i-Akbari in | Number of villages | Land revenue in 1872-73 in rupees | Area in acres | Population in 1872 |\n|----------------|----------|--------------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------|---------------|------------------|\n| Roortee        | R\u00farki    | 107                             | 58,034             | 127,096                          | 54,854        | R\u00farki, Manglaur, Fatehpur and Jaw\u00e1l\u00edapur |\n| Manglaur       | Manglaur | 115                             | 98,215             | 77,580                           | 66,742        | Manglaur, R\u00farki, Sult\u00e1npur, Kanf\u00e1ri |\n| Jaw\u00e1l\u00edapur     | Bhogpur  | 133                             | 50,686             | 144,846                          | 57,330        | R\u00farki, Jaw\u00e1l\u00edapur, Sult\u00e1npur, and Kanf\u00e1ri |\n| Bhagw\u00e1npur     | Various  | 148                             | 79,653             | 156,558                          | 63,770        | Manglaur, R\u00farki, Fatehpur, and N\u00e1g\u00e1l |\n|                | Total    | 498                             | 2,76,588           | 506,080                          | 242,696       |                  |\n| Nakf\u00e1r         | Nakf\u00e1r   | 108                             | 66,119             | 69,780                           | 50,590        | R\u00e1mpur, Gangoh, Nakf\u00e1r |\n| Saras\u00e1wa       | Saras\u00e1wa | 93                              | 63,463             | 60,588                           | 38,806        | Saras\u00e1wa, Nakf\u00e1r, Sah\u00e1ranpur |\n| Gangoh         | Gangoh   | 107                             | 72,109             | 83,783                           | 54,748        | Gangoh, N\u00e1nauta, R\u00e1mpur |\n| Sult\u00e1npur      | Bahat Kanj\u00e1war | 108 | 61,097             | 56,861                           | 45,378        | Chilk\u00e1na and Saras\u00e1wa |\n|                | Total    | 405                             | 2,82,787           | 271,015                          | 169,022       |                  |\n| GRAND TOTAL    | 1,736    | 11,72,950                       | 1,420,194          | 883,782                          |               |                  |\n\nAkbari parganahs.\nPARGANAH CHANGES.\n\nin the time of Akbar: the changes in their distribution were effected for the most part during the usurpation of the Rohillas and the Gujars in the last century.\u00b9\n\n| Parganah as known in the Ain-i Akbari | Included in modern parganah of | In tahsildari of | Notes |\n|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------|-------|\n| 3 Ambahta                            | Nakur                           | Nakur           | Absorbed before 1842. |\n| 5 Bahat Kanjawar                     | Bahat and Sultanpur             | Saharanpur      | This parganah became Bahat Sultanpur in Shahjahan's time.

O. No. 796, 11th of January, 1842, which gives the transfer of revenue and area in each case. (See parganah notices.)\nThe above table gives the state of the district sub-divisions at and after the thirty years' settlement under Regulation VII. of 1822. The alterations of boundaries that then took place so completely mixed up the greater number of the parganahs, that it would be difficult to attempt to follow out their individual or fiscal history, even if no further changes had been made. Not only were interchanges of villages between neighbouring parganahs effected, but large transfers were made between Saharanpur and the neighbouring district of Muzaffarnagar,\u2014134 estates, yielding a land revenue of Rs. 1,06,092, and Exchanges with Musaf-farnagar. Saharanpur to Muzaffarnagar, and 95 estates, yielding a revenue of Rs. 78,048, were received in exchange. The next series of changes were made by Mr A. Ross, and received the sanction of Government in 1855. This completed the breaking up of all the parganahs to such a degree, that it is now impossible to recognize any of the old sub-divisions. For example, the parganah of Saharanpur gave up 48 villages in 1855 to five parganahs, and received 21 villages from six parganahs in exchange; and similarly all through the whole district. The present parganahs, therefore, only resemble the old ones in name. Three parganahs\u2014Katha, Bahat and Jaurasi\u2014were absorbed, and three new parganahs were created,\u2014Haraura, Nagal and Bhagwanpur. These were distributed amongst four tahsils as at present.\n\nThe tahsils of Saharanpur and Nakur are within the civil jurisdiction of the Munsif of Saharanpur, and the remainder of the district is under the Munsif of Deoband, from both of whom appeals lie to the Judge of Saharanpur. There are at present (1874) ten stipendiary and three Honorary Magistrates within the district, subordinate to the same Judge, who has also appellate criminal jurisdiction. Similarly, the Magistrate has revenue jurisdiction as Collector, and most of the other stipendiary officers have dual powers.\n\nThe following table gives the number of Courts in existence at different periods:\n\n| Class of Court | 1840 | 1850 | 1860 | 1870 |\n|----------------|------|------|------|------|\n| Magisterial Courts | ... | 1    | 3    | 4    | 4    |\n| Civil Courts, including Revenue Courts | 3    | 11   | 10   | 10   |\n| Covenanted officers at work | 2    | 4    | 5    | 5    |\n\n1 Haraura from Saharanpur (23); Rurki (28); Jaurasi (1); Musaffarabad (63); Deoband (21); and Bahat (1); Nagal, from Deoband (118), and Katha (9); Bhagwanpur, from Rurki (69); Manglaur (19); Musaffarabad (17); Jaurasi (22); and Deoband (1). See further the parganah notices. 2 Sanctioned by G. O. No. 2050 of 14th May, 1855, which gives the number of villages, area and population in each transfer.\nThere are 29 police-stations, including eight outposts, in the district, supervised by a District Superintendent of Police. The jail is in charge of the Civil Surgeon. The other local officers are the Superintendent of the Botanical Gardens, the Superintendent of the Stud, the District Engineer, Canal Engineers and their Assistants, Deputy Inspector of Schools, and the Opium Agent, besides the large European staff at R\u00farki.\n\nThe scenery of the Sah\u00e1ranpur District presents much more variety of feature than that of any other of the Du\u00e1b districts: General appearance. on the north lie the Siw\u00e1l\u00edks, and below them the country presents, on a small scale, the same features of bh\u00e1bar and tar\u00e1i that are met with further east, under Garhw\u00e1l and Kumaon. Next comes the great alluvial kh\u00e1dir land in the north-east corner of the district, through which one-half the mountain drainage finds its way to the Ganges; then the great basins of the Ganges and Jumna; lastly we have the bangar or uplands, a great part of which is also, on a smaller scale, divided into lowland and upland, marked by the basins and watersheds of the rivers which flow through it southwards.\n\nThe Siw\u00e1l\u00edks run parallel to the Him\u00e1layas, having the same direction, from north-west to south-east. The length between the Ganges and the Jumna is 46 miles; the breadth averages from six to eight miles; and the highest peak attains an elevation of 3,140 feet above the level of the sea. The range is pierced by numerous passes, the principal of which are the Mohand and Kh\u00e9ri or L\u00e1l Darw\u00e1za, almost bisecting the chain, and the Timli, about seven miles east of the Jumna. The road to Mas\u00fari (Mussooree) passes through the Mohand pass, and that to the military station of Chakr\u00e1ta passes through the Timli pass. The other gorges are difficult of access, and have in a great measure never been explored. The whole range appears to be a mass of close-lying hills, with jagged and narrow tops worn into the most fantastic shapes, and clothed with sain, s\u00e1l, and various species of Druhinia. Extensive forests of the pinus longifolia (chitr) cover the northern slopes. The Siw\u00e1l\u00edks are abrupt and rugged on the southern side, and slope gently towards the Him\u00e1layas on the north. They may be roughly described as a series of right-angled triangles, with bases resting on the passes, perpendiculars facing the south-west, and hypotenuse sloping towards the north-east. Hence the serrated outline which strikes the traveller, a feature which is constantly exaggerated, owing to the destructibility of the material of which the hills are composed.\n\nThe geology of the Siw\u00e1l\u00edks has been the subject of much discussion, Geology. and will be more fully noticed in the description of the neighbouring district of Dehra D\u00fan. The sandstones of which the rocks are composed appear to belong to the newer tertiary or\nupper miocene period; and Dr. Falconer regards them as d\u00e9bris swept down from the Himalayas, overlying an upheaved portion of the plains at the foot of the higher range. Major Herbert also, in his mineralogical survey of the Himalayas, adopts a similar theory. Professor Medlicott, in a recent paper on the Nahan rocks, describes the Siwaliks as formed for the most part on the northern side of a great anticlinal flexure.\n\nAccording to him, the local dip \"varies very considerably, but there is a line along the south base of the chain, inside which the dip is invariably to some point between east and north. Near the axis the dip often amounts to 40\u00b0 and 50\u00b0; but in all the sections it lowers gradually to where it passes into the more or less horizontal strata of the D\u00fcn. At almost every point along the southern base we find the beginning of the reverse southerly dip; and in two places, one on the right bank of the Jumna, and the other on the right bank of the Ganges, the section of the rocks on the south of the anticlinal is nearly complete; and in both we observe the very opposite tendency to that described in the north, namely, in a direction from the axis the dip increases rapidly almost to the vertical.\"\n\n\"At each of the great transverse river gorges there is a complete break in the continuity of the anticlinal flexure, no doubt involving transverse faulting. In approaching Hardwar from the south, the structural conditions of the rocks are discernible from a distance. As far as the eye can reach to the west, the face of the Siwalik range presents a very broken series of bare cliffs, formed by the scarped edges of the\n\n---\n\n1 The following list gives the principal local papers that have hitherto been published on the subject:\n\nDr. Gerard's Fossil Shells and Chelonian Fragments.

For some miles, near the Ganges valley, the hills rise less abruptly, and are covered with jungle. The strata here dip southwards, on the south of the anticlinal, which strikes the Ganges near Bhimghora, to the north of the main mass of the range. Eastwards, across the Ganges, the usual structure of the range is restored: in the grey cliffs of the Chandi hill we see the scarped edges of strata dipping northwards. This contrast is most observable in the gorge at Hardwar, where the strata on the two sides of the river are seen dipping in opposite directions.\" \"The alteration in the features of the range to the west of the Ganges is not caused by any sudden turn in the direction of the anticlinal line of flexure; the curving is in the range itself: nor, on the other hand, is the change purely a caprice of denudation, for, together with the passage of the range to the south of the line of flexure, the strata on the north of the line are let down by a fault along the axis. Hence at Bhimghora we find the topmost beds of clay and gravel in contact with the base of the cliffs of sandstone, and inclining gently northwards. About the Motichor Rao (torrent) there is a flat synclinal; the Motichor ridge being formed of about the same beds of clay, gravel and boulders inclined to the south-west. These contrary slopes merge into the uniform northerly inclination west of Kanrao.\"\n\n\"This Bhimghora fault must have a throw of many thousand feet, estimated by the thickness of the continuous section of the strata Hardwar. to the south; and these clay and gravel beds on the north of the fault are probably even higher in the series than any beds in the section to the south. The northern contact beds are certainly associated with those of the Motichor ridge, which are certainly upper Siwalik, and, though here so little disturbed, have been in fact subject to the full effects of the disturbing forces. In proof of this assertion, we find a very rare and important section in the precipitous bank of the Ganges at Raiwala. Through the greater part of the cliff the stiff clays and the gravels have a steady south-westerly inclination, evidently the continuation of the arrangement in the Motichor hill; but at the north end of the cliff the same beds are seen to curve rapidly over to a high north-easterly underlie. On the east of the Ganges we again find the mode of arrangement that usually obtains in the Siwalik range: the lower beds on the south have a moderately high dip, and pass into the slightly disturbed upper beds on the north or D\u00fcn side. Along the south base an anticlinal is readily detected continuously from the Ganges to Paili Parao in the Bijnaur District. The Bhimghora fault makes no appearance on the east side of the river, the upper conglomerates being quite unbroken in front of it. The interruption of direct continuity, within so short a space, of so great a fault as that at Bhimghora, necessitates the existence of some oblique\nfracture along which the upheaval may die out. The abrupt change of dip on the two river banks points to this as the position of such a fracture. From the resemblance of the general sections on each side, one is inclined at first to suppose the features to have been once continuous, namely, the Ch\u00e1ndi hill anticlinal with that at Bhimghora, and to have been so separated by a subsequent cross fault. This is not, on the whole, the most satisfactory view; unless it keeps strictly in the bed of the river, there can be no such fracture, and general appearances are against it. The strata of the Motichor synclinal seem to correspond with those facing them to the east of the Ganges. The Ch\u00e1ndi anticlinal is certainly representative of that in the main Siw\u00e1l\u00edk range; and it is supposed that all these features of disturbance have been contemporaneously produced.\n\n\"In the gorge of the Jumna, we find, again, a northerly dip on the east side confronted by a southerly dip on the west, and on the same strike. The dislocation does not appear to be so great as in the Ganges, and, the river course being more winding, the opportunities for studying the details of structure are better. The anticlinal axis is easily traced along the base of the Siw\u00e1l\u00edk range. North of it, near the Jumna, the north-easterly dip of the sandstones and conglomerates is very steady; but along a narrow north-and-south band close to the river, the beds curve rapidly round to a north-westerly dip. Against this narrow transition dip the strata strike steadily from the north-west, and with a high south-westerly underlie. About half-way through the gorge the river takes a sweep to westwards, leaving on its left bank a terrace of these western rocks. Along this terrace the contrasting dips can be seen almost in contact. Towards the D\u00fan this line of fracture bends off, and seems to identify itself with an anticlinal line traceable along the southern edge of the Kay\u00e1rd\u00e1 D\u00fan, as far as Kolar. The section on the right bank of the Jumna is a good deal more complicated than the Hardw\u00e1r section. The anticlinal of the Kay\u00e1rd\u00e1 D\u00fan is obscurely seen in the Bhatta, just at its confluence with the Jumna. There appears to be more or less of faulting too; yellow boulder clays on the north are in crushed contact with sandstone and sandstone conglomerate on the south. A south-westerly dip soon becomes steady in these latter rocks, and continues so for four miles, to Kalesar, in the coarser conglomerates. In the ridge south of Kalesar these same beds rise by a sharp uniclinal curve to a high north-easterly dip, thus forming the most prominent ridge of the range. It is this ridge which bends round in continuation with the crest of the range south of Kalesar, thus cutting off the wedge-shaped area of the south-westerly dip. Orographically, and to some extent structurally, this area occupies a very analogous position to that of the Motichor Rao at the Ganges. At the south-east angle of these hills, next the Jumna, we have another change\nin the section: for a mile or more the conglomerates and sandstones dip at $80^\\circ$ to the southward, the strike thus converging to that of the ridge. A culmination of this convergence seems to be reached before we lose sight of the rocks; since in the river bank below Faizpur the same beds dip at $80^\\circ$ to the southeast. Here also, as at the Ganges, we observe a maximum of disturbance in the external portions of the range. In the case of the Jumna there is nothing to interfere with the suggestion, that the irregularities in the actual state of disturbance in the region of the gorge may be, in a great measure, owing to the unequal accumulation of deposits at the former river's mouth; and it may at least be asked if the river may not have had a more direct influence if, in the early stages of upheavement and contortion, the special erosion in the river course may not have had some influence in determining the position of these irregularities. Whatever view is adopted for the Jumna must be allowed its full force in the case of the gorge at Hardw\u0101r.\\(^1\\)\n\nThe portion of the district lying along the base of the Siwalik hills is still for the most part covered with forest and jungle. This tract is intersected by numerous torrents, dry during the hot weather, but carrying a considerable volume of water in the rains. These torrents flow into the Jumna on the west and the Ganges on the east. The watershed throughout is clearly defined, and may be traced to the Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur and Kunjnawar passes into the Siwaliks. These passes adjoin each other, and on their east the water trickles down to feed the most western tributary of the Sol\u00e1ni, an affluent of the Ganges; whilst on the west, and within a few hundred yards, the drainage unites with the head-waters of the Hindan, an affluent of the Jumna. From the utmost north-western point of the eastern watershed, a well-defined bank runs in a south-eastern direction towards the Ganges, inclosing between it and the Siwaliks an ever-widening expanse of low-lying lands, intersected by numerous torrents and continued through the midst of the Manglaur parganah into the adjoining district of Muzaffarnagar, where it joins the high bank of the Ganges at Shukart\u00e1r. To the west, however, the case is different: the highlands or raised central plateau there extend to the border of the B\u00fadhi Jumna, the old course of the Jumna, within a few miles of the existing river, and the kh\u00e1dir is small in extent. The broad tract of lowlying land mentioned above deserves particular notice for itself, and as being the site of the head-works and principal engineering triumphs of the great Ganges Canal.\n\nThis tract is of a triangular form; its apex lies at the Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur pass, its northern side is formed by the Siwaliks, its southern side by the upland ridge already mentioned, and its base is the lowlands or kh\u00e1dir proper of the Ganges.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) From Professor Medlicott's notice in the Rec., Geol. Sur., Vol. III (Part, 2), p. 131.\nThe surface, besides having a slope from north to south, has also a slope to the south-east, perceptible in the direction of the drainage lines. Within it, to the westward, there is a tract of upland on which the villages of Kheri and J\u00fadi are built. This tract is intersected by channels, into which the drainage collects, from not only the main plateau, but also from numerous lesser plateaus or mounds which have been chosen as the sites of villages in those parts. The most westerly of these channels drains all the country lying to the north of Kheri and Shah Mansir, including the drainage from mountain torrents for a distance of eight miles from the pass which forms the eastern watershed. The waters thus collected unite to form the Sol\u00e1ni river. Next we have the central lines of drainage in the Ratmau river; and further to the north-east the system known as the Patharinadi. Between the latter and the base of the hills there is a good deal of scattered drainage, which depends very much on the rain-fall for its character, and which is carried off by numerous small channels into the Ganges. The soil in this sub-montane tract is of a dark-chocolate colour, and rests on a stratum of boulders. In the immediate vicinity of the hills, the water rises to the surface, and exhibits itself in pools or streams and rills, which flow for a short distance and then disappear in the sand and shingle. Parallel to and south of this line is a belt (bh\u00e1bar), varying from five to ten miles in width, in which water can only be found at depths varying from 100 to 150 feet. This belt consists of a layer of boulders resting on an impervious bed of indurated gravel and clay, along which the percolation-water runs, until the bed again crops up at the surface to form the southern boundary of the waterless tract, and the northern boundary of the tar\u00e1i or moist tract. Here the streams again appear at the surface, and unite together to form rivers. In consequence of this absence of surface water, and the difficulty in constructing wells, there is little cultivation in this tract, which is in a great measure abandoned to primeval jungle. The lowlands on the west of the sub-montane tract are confined to the old or existing bed of the Jumna, and require no separate notice.\n\nThe remainder of the district may be roughly divided into kh\u00e1dir or low-land, and banga or upland. The kh\u00e1dir comprises the valley of the Jumna on the west, and that of the Ganges on the east. The western kh\u00e1dir consists of a strip of land bordering the left bank of the Jumna, and having an average breadth of four miles. The rise from this kh\u00e1dir to the uplands is marked by a very steep bank, which is sometimes cut up into ravines, but is more often sufficiently sloping to be cultivated. This bank rises in the Faizabad parganah, and from thence to Patna just below Chilk\u00e1na is single. It there bends suddenly inland towards the east, and encircles the depression in which the Sikri jhil lies. It finally disappears as a marked bank in Pilkhana, but reappears to the south in Rajdh\u00e1n.\nof Sars\u00e1wa, and after touching the Dhan\u00e1kpra jhil, gradually trends to the east and again to the south, so as to form the lip of the Kumh\u00e1rhera jhil, until it finally disappears at Jagahita Gujjar, in the central plateau on the road from Saharanpur to Ambahta. Immediately south of Patna a second bank becomes visible, which, though at first low, soon increases in height until it reaches Sars\u00e1wa, where it too becomes double. The true kh\u00e1dir is marked off by a bank, that incloses the tract from Kaly\u00e1npur which adjoins Sars\u00e1wa on the west, to J\u00fadi on the north of Sar\u00farpur, whilst this again is separated by an inner bank from the true uplands of Sars\u00e1wa. At J\u00fadi the two banks join and continue single through the whole of parganahs Nak\u00far and Gangoh, with the exception of a break at Aghi\u00e1na and at the extreme south of the district, caused by an outlying projection from the main line. On this bank are situated the important towns of Sult\u00e1npur, Chilk\u00e1na, Sars\u00e1wa, Nak\u00far, Gangoh and Lakhnauti. On the whole, the Jumna kh\u00e1dir is more compact and less swampy than that of the Ganges, and is therefore more highly cultivated.\n\nThe kh\u00e1dir proper or lowland of the Ganges imperceptibly amalgamates with the north-eastern tract already noticed. The upland bank forming the south-eastern boundary of this tract is much broken up by ravines near Jaur\u00e1si in parganah R\u00farki. These ravines in many places are annually cutting further back into the cultivated lands, from want of care on the part of the people. To the east of the bank which separates the lowlands of the Ganges from the uplands of the central plateau, and nearly parallel to it, there is a sandy ridge which runs through parganah Manglaur. To the west of this there is a more marked ridge, which rises near Ganeshpur in parganah R\u00farki, and intersecting parganah Manglaur, runs first on one side, and then on the other, of the S\u00edla Kh\u00e1la, and passing through Deoband, enters the Muzaffarnagar district. The plateau itself consists of a series of broad belts of high lands separated from each other by the depressions which contain the drainage lines known as the west K\u00e1li N\u00e1di, the Hindan, the Karsuni or Krishni, and the K\u00e1tha. All of these lines have a course for the most part from north to south, and present few marked peculiarities.\n\nThe patches of waste land called \u00fasar further south, caused by the efflorescence of reh, are much more rarely met with in Saharanpur than in the districts further south, but in the tract watered by the Eastern Jumna Canal, from N\u00e1nauta southwards, the presence of reh is a well marked and distinguishing feature of the soils. The ridges between the torrents of the sub-montane tracts are in most places covered with jungle, which, though now rapidly giving way to cultivation, is still extensive. These forests were left in the possession of the Rajp\u00fat zam\u00ednd\u00e1rs of the neigh-\nbouring villages until the year 1839, when they were excluded from the area under settlement, and measured together under the general heading of forest in the revenue survey, as follows:\u2014Khori-forest, 84,377 acres; Kansrao forest, 18,794; Pathari Nadi forest, 39,249\u2014total 142,420 acres. Soon after, sanction was received to the waste lands being given away to grantees under the usual conditions. The plan has been upon the whole successful. The original number of the grants was fixed at 114, and by the year 1856, tenders for 107 were accepted. Since then, several have been included in the assessed area, others have been resumed, and the number actually in the possession of grantees in 1870 was 79, viz., 63 in the Rurki Tahsil, and 16 in Saharanpur. Although agriculture has made extraordinary progress in Saharanpur during the last 30 years, the amount of land which is either barren, or culturable yet not cultivated, appears to be considerable.\n\nThe soils throughout the district are known as to quality under the terms mtsan, rauslt, d\u00e1kar, bh\u00fcr and bh\u00fada. Mtsan consists of the highly manured and carefully cultivated lands lying near the village site. The d\u00e1kar and rauslt are next, and are of equal value; the first is described as a stiff clay soil, and the latter as a light rich clay; both yield valuable winter and rain crops. The bh\u00fcr is a light sandy soil, in some places rising into ridges, as in the Manglaur and Deoband parganahs, where it is called gh\u00fcr, and which, without irrigation, only affords a rain crop. Bh\u00fada or bh\u00faa is the name given to the worst description of soil. The artificial classification adopted at the recent revision of settlement was into\u2014(1) canal-irrigated; (2) kh\u00e1dir or lowlands; (3) bangar or uplands; (4) a mixture of both; and (5) the waste and other jungle tracts beneath the Siwaliks. This arrangement sufficiently indicates the physical peculiarities of the district. The first comprises the tracts through which the Eastern Jumna Canal and the Ganges Canal, or their off-shoots, pass, and includes the whole of parganahs Saharanpur and Rampur, and portions of Nagal and the parganahs bordering on the Jumna.\n\nThe second class includes the tracts lying in the valley of the Jumna and the north-eastern half of Tahsil Rurki. The third class is formed from the parganahs occupying the centre of the district, from Faizabad to Deoband, and includes the eastern half of the Jumna parganahs. In the fourth class those villages are placed which, lying on the borders of the highland ridge, possess both upland and lowland cultivation, and those which occupy the kh\u00e1dir of the Hindan, Solani, and other streams. The fifth class contains the shingle tracts immediately under the Siwaliks, the jungle wastes of Jawalapur, Bhagwanpur and Manglaur, and the greater portion of the lands adjoining the Kali Nadi in the Deoband and Nagal parganahs. The following statement gives the\n\n---\n\n1 See further under Jungle Grants.\narea and character of each class of soil throughout the district, as ascertained by Mr. VansAgnew in 1864:\n\n| Classes          | Number of villages | Total area in acres | Asseable area | Cultivated | Irrigated |\n|------------------|--------------------|---------------------|---------------|------------|-----------|\n| I.

Both varieties are found in the central portion of the parganah more or less mixed together, so that they appear to pass insensibly from one into the other. In Haraura the soil is generally of a light soft character, which in low situations becomes indurated by continued submersion. In the northern parts of this parganah, the soil is occasionally more sandy, and there is therefore less cultivation. In Faizabad the soil is still lighter and more easily worked. Along the foot of the Siw\u00e1l\u00edks, wherever the ground is not cut up by hill streams, as also on the strip of land between the B\u00fadhi Jumna and the main bed of that river, a dark-chocolate soil is found, which, when of any depth, is extremely valuable and productive. This soil is found under the same conditions throughout one-third of parganah Muzaffarabad, the remaining two-thirds to the south, known as Raotala, with perhaps the exception of a few estates in the lowland of the Sol\u00e1ni, are covered with a soft light clay, which varies in value as it is more or less mixed with sand.\n\nIn the Jumna parganahs, comprising Tahsil Nak\u00far, the boundary between the uplands and the lowlands is sharply defined. In Sult\u00e1npur the lowlands, consisting of a sandy loam covered with silt deposits, is found the best for rice; on the bangar, a ridge of poor red sand, taking its rise at Maheisi, is seen, which reappears at intervals in the villages to the south. East of this line there is a continuous strip of fine d\u00e1k\u00e1r soil. In Sar\u00e9swa the soil varies from a stiff hard clay to a loose porous sandy soil, that is little retentive of moisture. In Gangoh and Nak\u00far the soil is of a mixed description, due to the undulating character of the surface, but on the whole rich and highly cultivated.\nIn Tahsil Deoband the soil consists of a rich clay, occasionally interspersed with sandy ridges. This tahsil is made up of a series of duns between the K\u00e1tha, the Hindan and the heads of the K\u00e1li Nadi, and therefore contains strips of land comprising every kind of soil. Tahsil B\u00farki is more varied still, containing as it does a large amount of the lands touching the foot of the Siw\u00e1l\u00edks. In Bhagw\u00e1npur the uplands are tolerably level, and in the lowlands the soil is excellent, changing from a rich loam to a rich clay. In R\u00farki, with the exception of a few sandy ridges, the soil is good and fertile. Jaw\u00e1l\u00e1pur, from its proximity to the hills, varies in character throughout its entire area. The south-western portions of Manglaur and Bhagw\u00e1npur differ little from the adjoining parganas of Tahsil Deoband. The main characteristic of the soils in the midland and southern portions of the district is the presence of kunkur, or impure carbonate of lime, occurring in spongy cavernous nodules of varying texture, in the sub-soil; lime-stone tufa, too, is occasionally found. To the north the substratum consists of shingle and boulders, gradually giving place to sandstone, which at Mohand appears at the surface.\n\nThe surface of the country has a general slope from north to south, and in the north-east of the Sah\u00e1r\u00e1npur district, this is combined with a slope towards the south-east. The bench-mark of the Trigonometrical Survey at Mohand shows 1,489 feet above the level of the sea. Following the road southwards, we have Bhatpura, 954 feet; Sah\u00e1r\u00e1npur, 902 feet; Deoband, 831-9 feet; Muzaffarnagar, 790 feet; Kh\u00e1tauli, 789-8 feet; Meerut, 735-4 feet; H\u00e1pur, 692-7 feet; Bulandsahr, 667 feet; Kh\u00farja, 647-7, and Aligarh, 610 feet. The fall is gradual throughout when once the raised land immediately under the hills is passed. The slope to the south-east, in the north-eastern portion of the district is shown by the course of the Sol\u00e1ni and other torrents which intersect that tract and flow into the Ganges on the right bank. The inclination of the plain to the west is shown by the barometrical heights of B\u00e1dshah Mah\u00e1l, 25 miles north of Sah\u00e1r\u00e1npur, near the debouch of the Jumna from the hills, which is said to be 1,210 feet above the level of the sea. The fall from Sah\u00e1r\u00e1npur to Bhainsw\u00e1l, 125 miles lower down, on the Eastern Jumna Canal, is only 125 feet; whilst from Hardw\u00e1r to Beira, on the Ganges Canal, in the same parallel, it is 136 feet.\n\nThe only large rivers are the Ganges on the east and the Jumna on the west. The main stream of the Ganges enters the Sah\u00e1r\u00e1npur district 180 miles from its source, by a well-marked gorge formed in the rock at Hardw\u00e1r. The town of Hardw\u00e1r lies at the foot of a high hill on the right, and the Ch\u00e1ndni Pah\u00e1r, 1,930 feet above the level of the sea, lies on the left; the main stream, known as the N\u00edldhara, flows under the Ch\u00e1ndni hill. The width of the gorge at its narrowest point is about one mile. Throughout it is divided into several channels, separated from each\nother by islands, many of which, are wooded with sis\u00fa, and are high enough to be beyond the reach of high-flood water. One of these branches, passing directly under the town of Hardw\u00e1r, joins the parent river at Kankhal, about two miles down. It is from a spot known as Ganesh Gh\u00e1t, on this branch, that the waters of the great Ganges Canal have been drawn. One of the first feeders of the Ganges is the R\u00e1nipur torrent, having a catchment basin of about 45 square miles. It is crossed by the canal at about 2\u00bd miles from its debouch from the mountains. Next to this comes the Pathari drainage system, divided into two parts, one called the Pathari or Pathar\u00f2 proper, connected with the mountains, and another, extending over the country lying to the east of Salimpur, and confined to a tract separated by a band of grass and jungle land from the mountains. The catchment basin here extends to about 80 square miles, and, from its source to where it is intersected by the canal, the Pathari has a course of about five miles. Next comes the Ratmau, with a catchment basin of about 126 square miles, of which 36 lie within, and 90 at the foot of the mountains. It carries off the whole of the drainage of the K\u00e1sn\u00e1o and Sakrauda forests. Its watershed on the east separates it from the Pathari valley, and on the west from the Sol\u00e1ni. And, lastly, we have the Sol\u00e1ni, which is noticed hereafter.\n\nThe drainage area of the Ganges is about 11,200 square miles. From the middle of October the waters diminish rapidly, until, by the middle of January, they attain their minimum. By March this volume is doubled, and increases during the summer months by the melting of the snow along its catchment basin within the Him\u00e1layas, until it reaches its maximum during the rains. Colonel Cautley, in his survey prior to the execution of the Ganges Canal, ascertained that the discharge of the Ganges at Hardw\u00e1r in December and January was 8,000 cubic feet per second. The results of experiments made in 1842 gave the discharge at Hardw\u00e1r on the 1st March at 7,166-1891 cubic feet per second, whilst at Garhmuktesar, on the same date, the gauges showed 8,685-2194 cubic feet per second; and on the 2nd of March, the discharge was 8,883-195 cubic feet, and on the 25th February, 8,681-894 cubic feet per second. The latter returns exhibit the increase due to the drainage of the kh\u00e1dir for a distance of 95 miles from Hardw\u00e1r, and the waters of the Sol\u00e1ni, Pathari, and other streams.\n\nOn the promulgation of the scheme for the Ganges Canal, for which it was proposed to take away 6,750 cubic feet of water, and leave only 1,250 cubic feet, one of the first objections urged by its opponents was the injury that would thereby be caused to navigation. Colonel Cautley clearly showed that the conditions of the tract lying along the upper course of the Ganges was in every respect similar to those of\nthe upper course of the Jumna, and that both showed the same peculiarities of bh\u00e1bar and tar\u00e1i as are found in Rohilkhand, with this exception, that whereas in Rohilkhand the northern boundary of the tar\u00e1i is marked by the visible rise of springs and rills from the surface, in the D\u00fa\u00e1b it is shown by a decrease in the depth from the surface of water in wells. The river beds, as well as the uplands, have their bh\u00e1bar and tar\u00e1i belts. In the river beds a deep impervious stratum exists, which is conterminous with the rise, near the foot of the hills, of the same stratum in the uplands, and crops out again at the northern limit of the tar\u00e1i belt. The intermediate space is dry and filled with boulders, beneath which the river water runs, and passing over the indurated stratum which underlies the boulders, again collects at the surface lower down; consequently embankments thrown across river beds in a bh\u00e1bar tract can only to a moderate extent interfere with the supply. Percolation will still go on, and the water will collect again when it arrives at the Tar\u00e1i portions. This was shown to be the case with the Jumna, which, though deprived of all its visible volume to feed the Eastern and Western Jumna Canals, still remained navigable at Agra, 250 miles below. Between the canal embankments on the Jumna and Agra, the only considerable feeder is the Hindan. Arguing from these premises, Major Cantley showed the fallacy of the objections raised by his opponents, and the results have fully justified his conclusions. Before the introduction of the canal, a few boats used to pass up to Garhmuktesar and Shukart\u00e1r; but the trade was unimportant, and is now fully provided for by the canal itself, which is navigable from end to end of the main line, and along the Cawnpore terminal branch to the Ganges.\n\nFrom the report of the Committee of 1866, the flood discharge of the Ganges Further inquiries as to at Hardw\u00e1r would appear to be from 180,000 to the volume. 190,000 cubic feet per second in the rains, without including the quantity discharged by the Mayapur dam and the canal, which would probably amount to 20,000 feet more. The discharge of the Sol\u00e1ni in time of flood has been estimated at 84,000 cubic feet, and the discharge of other drainage systems between Hardw\u00e1r and Shukart\u00e1r at least at as much more. The Committee estimated that a rise of 13\u00bd feet above the ordinary low level at Shukart\u00e1r would give a flood discharge there of 516,000 cubic feet per second, but that this would seldom happen. According to the registers kept at Cawnpore and Fatehgarh from 1848 to 1853, the highest flood at the former was 13 feet 8 inches, and at the latter was 10 feet 8 inches. Taking eleven feet as the normal rise between Hardw\u00e1r and Fatehgarh, this would give 279,000 cubic feet as the flood discharge per second at Shukart\u00e1r. In the dry season the depth in mid-channel still remains at from nine to ten feet. In April, 1866, the discharge was shown to be 5,300 cubic feet per second, whilst 5,000 cubic feet was passing down the canal.\nThe bed of the river in the upper part of its course is composed of stones and boulders, for the most part limestone, which have formed for a long time an article of trade. These disappear from twelve to sixteen miles from Hardw\u00e1r, and are replaced by a quartzose sand intermingled with mica, which becomes less abundant lower down. The slope in the upper portion of the stream is excessive, but disappears gradually with the substances of which the bed is composed. The banks, too, vary very much. Near the hills they are low on one side and very high on the other, whilst the depression through which the river wanders, stretches out to a great extent, and again contracts, until, at its confluence with the Sol\u00e1ni, it is barely two to three miles wide.\n\nThe Jumna debouches into the plains at a place, about 123 miles from its source, called Kh\u00e1ra, with a discharge of about 4,000 feet per second in March. The character of the bed is the same as that of the Ganges\u2014at first boulders, then quartzose sand interspersed with mica, then sand alone, and finally mud. It passes through a gorge somewhat resembling that of the Ganges at Hardw\u00e1r, but bolder and more varied in scenery. Presently the valley expands, and the river separates into several channels, one of which, the B\u00fadhi Jumna, cuts off a large piece of the Amb\u00e1l\u00e1 District, and rejoins the main stream eighteen miles lower down; whilst another of the same name branches off to the east. The kh\u00e1dir is more uniform in its width than that of the Ganges, neither expanding nor contracting to any great extent, except to the south of the Faizabad parganah, where it makes a bend for a short distance, which gives a maximum width of twelve miles, the average throughout being not more than four miles. The Jumna receives only the torrents passing through the north-western parganahs during its course through this district.\n\nProximity to the D\u00fan and the hills has given the northern portion of the district a character of its own. The rain-fall averages sixty inches a year over the belt of land lying at the foot of the Siw\u00e1l\u00edks. In addition, this tract receives the entire drainage of the Siw\u00e1l\u00edks themselves, from their watershed, which lies at a depth of seven or eight miles towards the D\u00fan, to their southern base. Owing to the steepness and rocky character of these hills, and the non-retentive properties of the soil through which the water flows, the 'raos' or hill torrents carry with them, with little diminution, nearly the entire rain-fall, and are the sources of almost all the considerable streams in this and the districts further south. Commencing at the north-west, the B\u00fadhi or B\u00farhi Jumna, already mentioned, diverges from the Jumna at Murti, just below the lower head of the Eastern Jumna Canal, and, after having run a mile or two through dense jungle, is arrested by a dam and turned into the canal.\nThis river originally served for the irrigation of the considerable tract lying between it and the Jumna, and the loss caused to the proprietors of the estates along its banks, by the appropriation of its water by the canal authorities, was brought to the notice of Government by Mr. E. Thornton in his report\\(^1\\) on the settlement, in 1839.A.D. Mr. Thornton proposed that a cut should be made a little below Murti, which should pass through 21 cultivated villages, and be sufficient to supply wholesome drinking water, and, for those who chose to pay for it, water for irrigation purposes also. This application, as yet, has had no effect; and a subsequent attempt, by the proprietors of certain estates, at their own expense, to make a cut in another place, has only resulted in failure. As observed elsewhere, the soil of this tract is of the deep chocolate colour, resting on a boulder formation, which does not admit of the construction of earthen wells; and, owing to the great depth at which water is found, a brick-built well is entirely beyond the means of the inhabitants.\n\nEast of the Budhi Jumna, the Raipur, Jatonwala, Naugang and Maskhara torrents intersect the Faizabad parganah. The Jatonwala drainage has been turned into the Naugang, whilst the latter, in its turn, has been relieved by permitting a portion of its waters in time of flood to enter the Eastern Jumna Canal. The Naugang eventually joins the Maskhara, and through it the Jumna. The Raipur torrent flows into the Budhi Jumna. Parganah-Muzaffarabad is also intersected by four hill torrents, two of which, the Barkala and Sahsrao, after joining the Duff Canal, fall into the Maskhara; a third joins the Hindan, and a fourth flows into the Solani.\n\nThe northern portion of the bangar of Tahsil Nakur is drained by a small stream which joins the Maskhara near Badgaon, and the middle portion of the tahsil forms the reservoir whence the Budhi Nala is fed. This stream rises near Patna, where the drainage of the Abdullahpur and Chilkana basins finds its way into the khadar, and, after closely skirting the upland bank as far as Gokalpur in Sarsawa, thence crosses the khadar, and finally falls into the Jumna just below Fatehpur in Nakur. On its way it receives the drainage of the Sikri jhil by a channel which, Mr. Wynne considers, might easily be deepened so as to completely drain the more swampy portions of that marsh. The Dhaulapra jhil occupies the next great depression to the south, but has at present only an imperfect outlet, which it is intended to improve towards the Budhi Nala. Close to it is the Kumbharsa jhil, which appears to have two outlets,\u2014one to the west, passing through Birwi, and eventually entering the Saindli Nadi near Meghan Mazra on the borders of the district, and another to the east, which forms the head of the tortuous Katha Nadi.\n\n\\(^{1}\\) Set. Rep., I.; 114.\nThe K\u00e1tha pursues a slow winding course until it falls into the Jumna near Nagla Rai, of parganah Kair\u00e1na, in the Muzaffarnagar district. The bed is dry for three-fourths of the year between Harp\u00e1l and Mirzapur. Thence, as far as N\u00e1g\u00e1l in Gangoh, the water collects, and often overflows its banks and forms swamps on either side. From N\u00e1g\u00e1l to Radaur the bed only contains water during the rainy seasons. Thence the swamps recommence, and these have been increased by the injudicious admission of the drainage from near the old canal bed in western R\u00e1mpur, and that of the Andauli swamp, by means of cuts constructed by the canal officers. The water heads back in the K\u00e1tha to such an extent as to check the flow in the cuts, and consequently the R\u00e1mpur cut often bursts its banks during the rains, while the other is of little use in draining the marsh. Mr. Wynne estimated the loss in revenue from the want of proper drainage at Rs. 4,000 a year. The drainage of western Nak\u00far is effected by the Saindli Nadi, which takes its rise in a large crescent-shaped jh\u00edl in the Jumna khaddir near Kalheri, which appears to have been the remains of a former bend in the old bed of the river. It assumes the character of a stream first at Sirsli, and receiving at Meghan Mazra the drainage from the western outlet of the Kumbh\u00e1hera jh\u00edl, flows in a fairly straight course close to the upland bank in Gangoh, and finally debouches in the Jumna below K\u00fanda.\n\nPassing hence to the south of the central tract, the drainage of the west of R\u00e1mpur is carried off in the bed of the old canal until it collects near Anantmau, whence it is taken by the Andauli cut into the K\u00e1tha. The drainage of the tract south of this and about N\u00e1nauta is carried off by another cut into the Krishni on the east, while in the extreme south-west another cut leads the drainage through Titron into the K\u00e1tha. The heads of the Krishni are in the old canal and in an off-shoot of the Hindan, having its origin in the Sah\u00e1ranpur parganah. It flows down the centre of R\u00e1mpur in a well-defined course, and eventually joins the Hindan. To the west a small rivulet carries off the superfluous moisture of a long strip of d\u00e1k\u00e1ri land, from Chakn\u00e1 southward.\n\nThe central drainage, however, chiefly passes off through the Hindan. This Hindan river, also known as the Chhaja, has its rise in parganah Muzaffarabad. It takes thence a direction slightly south-west until it enters the Sah\u00e1ranpur parganah, where it receives on the right bank the N\u00e1g\u00e1deo Nadi, and seven and a half miles below Sah\u00e1ranpur, the united streams of the Pandhoi, a rivulet rising near the village of Sanklapuri, a little north of the city, and of the Dumaula, a small river draining the country further north-east, and meeting the Pandhoi at Sah\u00e1ranpur. From Ahmadpur the Hindan communicates, by a cross channel, with the Krishni or Karsuni Nadi, and again near Ni\u00e1mu, in the Muzaffarnagar District. It is\neverywhere fordable in Saharanpur, except after rain, and, indeed, generally either altogether or nearly dry. It is not used for irrigation. It is crossed by the road from Saharanpur to Dehra, that from Karnal to Meerut, and Karnal to Muzaffarnagar. At the southern extremity of the Muzaffarnagar district, it receives the west Kali Nadi, which rises in the same latitude on the east, and below this the Krishni on the opposite side, and eventually joins the Jumna in parganah Dankaur of the Bulandsahr district.\n\nEast of the Hindan the West Kali Nadi rises about sixteen miles south of the Siwaliks, and passing through parganahs Haraura and Nagal, flows southward through Deoband into the Muzaffarnagar district. It receives on its left bank the Kalandra, Sila, Khala and Kalandar streams. The last flows inside the upland sandy ridge of the Manglaur parganah, and joins the Kali on the border of the district. The great drainage line of the east, however, is formed by the Solani, called near its source the Kandur. This river issues from the Mohand pass, having its source at the summit, near Shorepur, and then skirting the uplands of Kheri cuts across, the khadir, and follows the upland bank until it finally debouches into the Ganges through the Gordhanpur jhil in the Muzaffarnagar district, near Shukartar, after a course of about 55 miles. The Solani is joined in its course, first, by the Hailaura, itself the recipient of many 'raos' or hill torrents; and second, by the Ratmau. The latter takes its rise in a pass of the same name, and receives the drainage of the several 'raos' from its source to Kansrao. It passes across the Ganges Canal at Dhanauri, where it is used as an escape for the canal. The volume of water is so much increased by this, that when it joins the Solani it contains a greater volume than its recipient, and frequently causes injury to the neighbouring estates by dilution and inundation.\n\nProceeding eastward, the next stream is the Pathari Nadi, which also takes its rise in the Siwaliks, and is carried over the Ganges Canal near Bichpuri. A few hundred yards beyond, the distinct channel ceases, and the water finds its way as it can to the khadir land below, covering the upper lands with silt, and cutting up the lower lands on the slope with ravines. As soon as the khadir is reached, the several scattered channels again collect into one, and the Pathari flows through swampy ground till it joins the Banganga. This river issues from the Ganges just above Ajitpur, in parganah Jawalapur, and flows through the thickly wooded wastes of the centre, and the open but scantily cultivated plains in the south of the parganah. Of late the Ganges has begun to pour more and more of its waters into the Banganga, which has led to considerable damage being done to the villages affected by it in the Muzaffarnagar district. Mr. S. Martin has suggested that something might be done to avert, or at least control, this excessive flow, especially as those interested were willing to bear the cost,\nand the remedy has been pronounced by Captain Forbes quite feasible, and not expensive.\n\nTo prevent repetition of facts and figures which should otherwise be given under many districts, the general history of the two great systems of canals in the Upper D\u00fanb has been given once for all in the introduction. The Eastern Jumna Canal was opened in the year 1830, and the Ganges Canal commenced to distribute water for irrigation in 1855. The amount of land irrigated in this district by both the canals will be found under the head of \"Irrigation\" in Part II. of this notice.\n\nThe highest point on the river Ganges which boats have ever reached is Shukart\u00e1r. Above that point, the navigation is entirely restricted to timber-rafts, or now and then a boat built in the D\u00fan and floated empty down the river, but there is a brisk traffic up and down the Ganges Canal, which was opened for navigation in 1856. Mr. W. Connor has given some calculations, showing the amount of canal traffic to and from and passing R\u00farki, from the 1st January, 1870, to the 31st December, 1872. It may be noted here that the principal exports (in maunds) during that period were\u2014cotton, 12,477; iron, 13,246; and hemp, 2,745. The principal imports were\u2014iron for the R\u00farki workshops, 27,329 maunds; firewood, 148,344; limestone boulders, 138,144; earth, 117,800; kunkur, 12,150; squared timber, 10,351 pieces; timber in logs, 1,468; bamb\u00fas, 345,516; unsquared timber, 14,028; and bricks 87,683. Hardly anything passes up by way of R\u00farki except stone, 5,000 maunds; and the principal commodities passing down by R\u00farki seem to be timber, grass, firewood, bamb\u00fas, lime, boulders, in fact forest produce of various descriptions, and bricks. The average tonnage of the boats plying on the canal is 400 maunds, and right-of-way is levied quarterly on each, at the rate of Rs. 13-8, without reference to distance or locality.\n\nThere is no navigation on the Jumna Canal, and that on the Jumna river is naturally even more limited than that on the Ganges, though it appears that boats averaging 52 feet long at top, 32 feet at bottom, 16 feet wide at top, 13 feet at bottom, 4 feet in depth, and drawing 2\u00bd feet of water when laden, of 600 maunds burden, used to be built at R\u00e1mpur Mandi, opposite Rajgh\u00e1t in the D\u00fan, and floated down the river for sale. It is also stated that from 300 to 350 such boats, laden with karls and logs, used annually to leave for Dehli and Agra; while the amount of bh\u00e1ng yearly despatched from Rajgh\u00e1t amounted to 3,000 or 4,000 maunds, besides the same quantity of stone-lime. This traffic was chiefly carried on in the hot weather and rains, and some return traffic in Agra stone, millstones, iron and drugs also existed. Little or no trace of either traffic is now to be found in this District.\nThe principal jhil in the district have already been noticed. The old Sult\u00e1npur jhil had increased (1860) to such an extent to swallow up quite the bulk of the formerly cultivated lands, so that the revenue of several villages had been largely reduced, while others were held under direct management. Owing to the successful operations of the canal officers, the swamp has been drained, and all but a few isolated patches reclaimed; and the improvement has been so steady, that these patches, too, will also become culturable. Other projects for the reclamation of lands swamped by excessive percolation from the canal, and by bad drainage, have been undertaken by the same department with the happiest results.\n\nThe main line of communication is the Dehli and Panj\u00e1b Railway, opened in 1869. The first station is Deoband, five miles from the border of the Muzaffarnagar district; the next is Sah\u00e1ranpur, 21 miles further on; and the last is Sars\u00e1wa, 10 miles from Sah\u00e1ranpur and five miles from the Jumna. The railway follows the road that has been the highway from the Du\u00e1b to the Panj\u00e1b from the earliest times. A project for a branch line from the Dehli line at Deoband via R\u00farki and Hardw\u00e1r to Dehra, was prepared by Mr. A. Campbell, Superintendent of the R\u00farki Workshops, in the year 1868, but nothing came of his proposals. A detailed account of his design, based upon the narrow gauge system and the theory that the Ganges Canal works might be utilised for railway purposes, has been printed at the Thomason Civil Engineering College Press. His estimate of the probable cost was Rs. 13,70,000. Surveys have also been undertaken in connection with the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway which is to join the Panj\u00e1b line at Sah\u00e1ranpur.\n\nAmongst the principal roads of the first class and metalled is that from Sah\u00e1ranpur to the tunnel in the Mohand pass leading to Dehra, 34\u00bd miles. The traffic to the D\u00fan and the large hill stations of Landour and Mussooree (Mas\u00fari) follows this road, which is passable for wheeled carriages on to R\u00e1jpur, at the foot of the Landour hills. Another route to the D\u00fan, formerly much used, was a road branching off from the old trunk road a little above the town of Muzaffarnagar, and thence to R\u00farki, 22 miles east of Sah\u00e1ranpur, and on to Fatehpur, 13 miles from Mohand and 15 miles from Sah\u00e1ranpur. This line also is metalled throughout. An unmetalled road runs from the Muzaffarnagar boundary through Deoband and N\u00e1g\u00e1l to Sah\u00e1ranpur, which is metalled from 6 miles on the Deoband side of Sah\u00e1ranpur through Sars\u00e1wa to the Jumna. The metalled road from R\u00farki to Fatehpur is joined to that from Mohand to Sah\u00e1ranpur by a raised earthen road from Bhagw\u00e1npur, 6\u00bd miles beyond R\u00farki, to G\u00e1galheri, 7 miles from Sah\u00e1ranpur, for a distance of 8\u00bd miles.\nThe second-class raised and bridged unmetalled roads, and the third-class raised unbridged and unmetalled roads within the district, are as follow:\n\n### Second-class Roads.\n\n| From          | To            | Length | From          | To            | Length |\n|---------------|---------------|--------|---------------|---------------|--------|\n| Saharanpur    | Jalalabad     | 33     | Rurki         | Bahadurabad   | 9      |\n|               | Khairali      | 39     | Bijnaur       | Bijnaur       | 22     |\n|               | Chhikina      | 9      | Gagalheri     | Nagal         | 10     |\n| Ganjeh        | Bedgeon       | 17     | Lakhnau      | Manglaur      | 16     |\n| Deoband       | Manglaur      | 10     | Titron        | Jalalabad     | 4      |\n| Sarusa        | Nakur         | 8      | Titron        | Lekhara       | 11     |\n| Nakur         | Titron        | 18     | Nakur         | Rahamanpur    | 5      |\n| Saharanpur    | Musaffarnagar | 21     |               | Deoband       | 4      |\n\n### Third-class Roads.\n\n| From          | To            | Length | From          | To            | Length |\n|---------------|---------------|--------|---------------|---------------|--------|\n| Bahadurabad   | Hardwar       | 8      | Hardwar       | Khara         | 43     |\n| Musaffarnagar | Bandir Nadi   | 6      | Bhagwanpur    | Bahadurabad   | 18     |\n| Deoband       | Bijnaur       | 6      | Manglaur      | Lukesar       | 11     |\n\nThe river Hindan is crossed by a good bridge at Gagalheri, and there used to be another bridge across the same river at the village of Lakhnau, six miles from Saharanpur, on the road to Deoband; but it was carried away by a flood some years ago, and has never since been repaired. From Rurki to Hardwar, the left bank of the Ganges Canal affords an excellent path, nineteen miles long, for foot passengers; but country carts are forced to take a more difficult, though shorter route, through the Ganges khadar.\n\nThe ferries on the Ganges are at Shishamghat Balawali, and Nagal; those on the Jumna are at Begi, Fatehpur Jat, Rajghat and Maudhapur. The former are under the Collector of Bijnaur, and the latter under the Deputy Commissioner of Umballa (Ambala). The only ferries under the Collector of Saharanpur are those at Ranipur and Dargahipur on the Banganga; and these are only required during the rains. There is also a bridge-of-boats across the Ganges opposite Kankhal.\n\nThe climate of Saharanpur is that of the North-West Provinces in general, modified by a northern position and proximity to the hills. It is at one season tropical, at another partially European. The cold weather commences earlier and lasts longer than in the districts further south-east, but the heat in May and June is considerable. Another peculiarity of the climate is, that although the severity of the hot season is, at its commencement, sometimes mitigated by local thunderstorms and showers, evidently due to the neighbourhood of the hills, the regular rains (or summer monsoon) are later in their arrival here than in the Lower Provinces, and\nthe rain-fall is less. The minimum temperature observed by Dr. Royle was 37\u00b0 in January, the maximum 105\u00b0 or 107\u00b0, as compared with 111\u00b0 at Ghazipur and 114\u00b0 at Benares. The mean temperature of the cold weather months, November, December, January and February, is 64\u00b0, 55\u00b0, 52\u00b0, and 55\u00b0 respectively. The temperature rises rapidly from the beginning of March, and by the middle of June the maximum is attained. The rains usually set in towards the close of that month, and last till the middle of September; but they have been known to continue a month later. Irregularities in their occurrence are surely followed or accompanied by disease, generally in the form of fever.\n\nThe following table gives the mean monthly temperature in the shade, and the mean monthly range at Rurki, in the north-east of the district:\n\n| Year | Mean | Range |\n|------|------|-------|\n| 1870 | 57   | 32    |\n| 1871 | 56   | 28    |\n| 1872 | 57   | 37    |\n\nFor 1872 the range shows the difference between the highest and lowest reading of the maxima and minima in the shade. The general mean is that of the standard thermometer. See Roorkee for details.\n\nThe average total rain-fall, according to seasons, for the whole district, has been as follows from 1860-61 to 1870-71:\n\n| Period                      | Total |\n|-----------------------------|-------|\n| 1st June to 30th September  | 16.7  |\n| 1st October to 31st January | 0.2   |\n| 1st February to 31st May    | 2.0   |\n| Total                       | 18.9  |\nThe actual total rain-fall for the principal towns in the district for a series of years, and irrespective of season, is given below from records existing in the office of the Board of Revenue:\n\n| Name of Station | 1844-45 | 1845-46 | 1846-47 | 1847-48 | 1848-49 | 1849-50 | Average |\n|-----------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Sadr Station    | 45'81   | 30'30   | 35'10   | 48'74   | 20'07   | 38'31   | 34'72   |\n| Deoband        | 40'02   | 28'25   | 48'90   | 41'88   | 24'66   | 68'06   | 41'96   |\n| Manglaur       | 37'86   | 23'26   | 36'51   | 49'01   | 20'16   | 39'27   | 34'91   |\n\n| Name of Station | 1849-50 | Name of Station | 1849-50 | Name of Station | 1849-50 |\n|-----------------|---------|-----------------|---------|-----------------|---------|\n| Nakur           | 31'22   | Jawalapur       | 21'85   | Gangoh          | 27'19   |\n| Rarki           | 30'87   | Hardwar        | 49'58   | Kheri           | 32'47   |\n| Nagal           | 24'30   | Sultanpur      | 38'02   | Bahat           | 26'58   |\n| Badgaon         | 17'04   | Bhagwanpur     | 26'92   | Ralpur          | 28'15   |\n| Rampur          | 31'49   | Chilkana       | 24'36   | Mohan           | 31'01   |\n\nPART II.\n\nPRODUCTIONS OF THE DISTRICT.\n\nThe fauna of the district is abundant and varied. Tigers (sher d\u00e1rhid\u00e1) are still numerous in the forest belt along the foot of the Siwaliks, and also in the kh\u00e1dir of the Ganges. According to Hamilton the lion existed in vast numbers in this district in the early part of the present century, but Dr. Royle, whose means of information were of the best description for the same period, speaks of the lion as only having been found \"to the west of the Jumna, especially on the edge of the desert near H\u00e1nsi.\" It is stated by Bernier, as quoted by Thornton, that the country about Agra and Delhi and along the upper course of the Jumna had extensive waste tracts abounding in wild beasts, and that, among others, the lion was frequently hunted and slain by the rulers of Dehli. There is, however, no well authenticated tradition of lions ever having been found in this district. Leopards are common, and Mr. H. B. Webster, C. S., describes\nthree varieties. The first and largest kind is the leopard proper or panther, locally called the *sher guld\u00e4r*, a powerful animal capable of killing a bullock. The second is smaller and of a darker colour; it is known as the *lakhabagha*, or tree-tiger, and seeks inferior prey; and the third variety, named *tend\u00e9a*, is not much larger than a small sized setter, and not so high. Wild cats of all sorts are numerous, some of them are not larger than the domestic cat, and others approach the *tend\u00e9a* in size.\n\nThe lynx is also found as well as the hyena, and wolves are numerous. The sloth-bear (*Gh\u00e1bar*) inhabits the Siwaliks, and the wild-boar is found all over the district, and is especially abundant in the kh\u00e1dir. In the rains wild elephants frequently descend from the Siwaliks to feed, and often come as far as the Ganges valley, ten miles south of the hills, where they cause much destruction amongst the rice fields. The most common species of deer are the *s\u00e1mb\u00e1r* otherwise called the *mah\u00e1* or *jarau*, the *chit\u00e1l* or spotted deer, the *kh\u00e1k\u00e1r* or barking deer, and the *p\u00e1r\u00e1* or hog deer. Antelopes (*hiran*), the four-horned antelope (*chaustinga*), and the *g\u00e1ral* or Himalayan chamois are also found, but the two latter do not venture into the lowlands, and the black buck is comparatively rare. The *nilg\u00e1i* (*Portax pictus*) is found in the river basins and small jungles to the north. The *langur* (*Presbytis schistaceus*) so common at Mussooree descends as far as the very edge of the Siwaliks, a fact which is the more remarkable as the *langur* is also found at elevations of from 11,000 to 12,000 feet in Kumaon. The smaller mammalia, as jackals, foxes, porcupines may be passed over. The animals inhabiting the D\u00fan will be found under the notice of that district, and those common to all the D\u00fa\u00e1b districts will be given under the Farukhabad district. There are not many poisonous snakes; the *kareit* and the *kobra* are those best known. Of those not poisonous, the Siwalik python, a sort of boa-constrictor, which grows to an immense size, is the best known, but, notwithstanding that it often attains a length of twenty-five feet, it appears to be harmless, and confines its depredations to the smaller mammalia. The deaths from snake bites and the attacks of wild animals are not numerous, considering the character of the district. In 1869 the deaths from these causes were given at 45, of which 44 were due to snake bites and only one to wild animals. In 1872, the deaths from snake bites and wild animals were as follow:\n\n| Month | Males | Month | Males | Females | Month | Males | Females | Month | Males | Females |\n|-------|-------|-------|-------|---------|-------|-------|---------|-------|-------|---------|\n| January | 1     | April |       |         | July  | 4     | 4       | October | 2     | 1       |\n| February |      | May   |       |         | August | 5     | 4       | November | 1     |         |\n| March   | 1     | June  |       |         | September | 3 | 3       | December | 2     |         |\nAs observed in other districts, the deaths from snake bites are more frequent during the rains. No rewards are given for their destruction, but for that of other wild animals, the following scale is allowed:\u2014Tigers and full-grown bears, Rs. 5; hyena or female wolf, Rs. 3; tiger cub, Rs. 2-8; male wolf, Rs. 2-2; female wolf-whelp 12 annas; male-whelp 8 annas.\n\nThere is no local breed of cattle in the district. Cows fetch from Rs. 10 to Rs. 40 a head, according to their milch qualities. The bullocks in common use for agricultural purposes cost from Rs. 15 to Rs. 50 each. The average is about Rs. 30. The price of buffaloes varies from Rs. 20 to Rs. 40. The breed of horses in the southern part of the district called the K\u00e1tha is considered very good, and it was partly on that account that a stud depot was established at Sah\u00e1r\u00e1npur in the year 1842. Stud stallions have been located for breeding purposes in Bhaila, Siml\u00e1na and others of the K\u00e1tha villages, as well as at Bhagw\u00e1npur, Chandanpur, and Bhalewa Gaj in the R\u00farki Tahsil, and the foals produced from the zamind\u00e1ri mares are purchased on account of Government. It would be very hard to calculate the cost of a horse thus procured before it is fit for use. Each can hardly cost Government less than from Rs. 1,000 to Rs. 1,200, if not more. Casters, which used to be sold by auction at the Hardw\u00e1r fair every year, fetch from Rs. 50 to Rs. 300 each, the average being from Rs. 100 to Rs. 150. A fair country-bred can be had for about Rs. 200 in the district, but at Hardw\u00e1r, prices are much higher, and a good horse can rarely be purchased for less than Rs. 400 or Rs. 500. The best horses are generally picked up by the agents from the Irregular Cavalry regiments, before the caravans of horse dealers from Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n or elsewhere actually reach the fair itself, and are in this way bought at more reasonable prices. A private speculator is fortunate if he can get a really good animal for Rs. 400. At Sah\u00e1r\u00e1npur, oats have been used instead of gram for feeding horses, with much advantage, though natives are, through habit, prejudiced against its use. The Rajp\u00fat zamind\u00e1rs have been, from time immemorial, the principal horse breeders in the district.\u00b9\n\nThere are three systems of breeding in the farms. First the admi system, under which the Government lend mares to the farmers and supply stallions; second,\n\n\u00b9 A Parliamentary return recently issued on the state of the breeding studs in India, shows that the system has not been successful after the experiment has been tried for 76 years. The Bombay and Madras armies are supplied with horses, from the open market, the former paying \u00a355, and the latter \u00a357 10s. per horse though the Madras horse is raised to \u00a391 by the unwise retention of the animals in depot. The Government cost of breeding horses is stated by the Controller of Military Accounts at \u00a3148, and by the latest Stud Committee at \u00a3219; the difference arises from the modes of debiting to the Department. This enormous discrepancy is rendered all the more glaring by a statement of the Committee to the effect that strings of northern horses from Kabul are brought to the market at \u00a340 each.\nthe zamindari system, under which Government supply the stallions to the farmers' mares and buy the foals; and thirdly, the home system, under which Government owns both stallions and mares. It is believed that the Government of India propose to abolish the asami system and to some extent the zamindari system, and to establish a new breeding farm in the Panjab in order to maintain a reserve of one thousand horses. The Duke of Argyll objected to both these proposals. While, however, granting that studs cannot immediately be abolished, he proposed that Government should gradually withdraw from horse-breeding and liberally encourage private enterprise in that direction by prizes, giving good prices for foals and importing stallions. The report shows that at present horse-breeding is a decaying pursuit.\n\nThe mogar or snub-nosed alligator, which attacks both cattle and men, and the garidyali, an alligator provided with a long snout, which lives on fish, are found in the Ganges, the Jumna, the canals, and sometimes in the smaller streams. The larger rivers harbour a repulsive looking kind of fish called a ganchi, a regular fresh-water shark, of which specimens have been caught weighing over one hundred pounds. The character of the fisheries in the Meerut Division has already been noticed in the introduction, and a list of the principal species found in these provinces has been given there. The most valuable of the edible fish found in this district are the rohu, mahaser, amurdi, sol, and chilwa.\n\nThough not so plentiful as formerly, fish are still found in the larger rivers in considerable quantities, and in the small streams after rain; but measures are sadly needed to prevent the wholesale destruction of fish of all sizes near the canal heads, more particularly on the Jumna Canal. Fish is used as an article of food by the Muhammadans, which form so important an element in the population, by the lower orders of Hindus, and even by certain clans of Rajputs. The Meos, both Hindu and Musalm\u00e1n, are the principal fishermen, and come into this district chiefly from Bijnaur. The price of fish is generally from one to two annas a ser, but the amurdi is dearer.\n\nThe forest produce will be described under the D\u00fcn District and in the supplementary volume on the vegetable products of these provinces. It is sufficient to notice here the food grains and products under cultivation in the district. The rab\u00ed or spring crop is sown in October and reaped in March to April. Its staples are wheat, barley, oats, millet, peas, beans, carrots, vegetables, linseed and the different species of mustard seed, both of which last are cultivated for the oil obtained by expression. The khartf or rain crop is sown in June and gathered in October, and consists of rice, jo\u00e1r, Indian corn, bajr\u00e1, cotton, melons and vegetables. Indigo and cotton are also grown to a considerable extent since the introduction of canal irrigation has rendered the growth of the former crop\nSAHARANPUR DISTRICT.\n\na certainty.

Mr. Thornton's produce tables will be found at p. 23 of the Appendix to the Settlement Report (1864).\n\nThe mode of husbandry does not differ from that practised in Meerut and other districts of this division. The local estimate of the extent of land which can be cultivated by a single plough depends upon the number of bullocks used. One plough usually takes two pair of oxen, and is called a *pukka hal*, while a plough with only one pair is known as an *adh\u00e1 hal*. By means of the former, from 80 to 100 *kuchcha* bighas (13 to 16 acres) may be tilled in the year, and by the latter from 40 to 50. Sometimes three pair of bullocks are used in one plough; in which case 150 bighas *kuchcha* and upwards may be kept under cultivation between the two harvests. One plough represents a capital of from Rs. 71 to Rs. 137, as noted below. The rotation of crops is guided by the season, and land is seldom intentionally left fallow for any length of time, except in such places as the wilder parts of the Ganges *kh\u00e1dir*.\n\nIrrigation is carried on extensively in this district from wells, tanks, and canals. According to Mr. Court's return of 1870, out of a total cultivated area amounting to 736,878 acres, 162,317 acres were irrigated, and of these more than one-half, or 84,404 acres, were irrigated from canals alone. In parganah Sah\u00e1r\u00e1npur the irrigation is almost exclusively from canals, with a small amount from wells and tanks, and none from the Hindan, Dumaula and Pandh\u00f3i, which intersect the parganah. In Haraura, Muzafrabad and the greater portion of Faizabad, again, we have only well-irrigation, and in the northern portions of the two latter parganahs only from *pukka* wells, owing to the great depth at which water is found. In the Nak\u00fcr Tahsil the uplands beyond the reach of canal irrigation, as a rule, afford facilities for the excavation of earthen wells, which last from one season to two or three years according to the nature of the subsoil. In the country about the head-waters of the K\u00e1tha, Hindan and west K\u00e1l\u00ed N\u00e1di, the earthen wells require to be strengthened by a circular framework of roughly-hewn short flat planks, or rather plates of *dh\u00e1k* (*Butea frondosa*) wood, loosely fitted together; above this, again, is a wattling of *b\u00e1jr\u00e1* stalks to within a few feet of the top, when the soil is usually stiff enough to require no further protection. But even this somewhat elaborate arrangement will seldom last more than four years. In portions of Bhagw\u00e1npur, the timber lining has often to be carried\n\n---\n\n1 The *pukka* bigha is 0.50693 of an acre, and three *kuchcha* bighas are equivalent to one *pukka* bigha.\n2 One or two pair of bullocks, Rs. 60 to Rs. 120; plough and appurtenances, Rs. 2-8 to Rs. 8-8; harrow, Rs. 1-8; *\u00e1d* or *k\u00e1li*, Rs. 5 to Rs. 10, and sundries about Rs. 2. As this calculation differs according to the insertion or absence of petty items, it might be safer to say that the capital invested in one plough varies from Rs. 81 to Rs. 160.\nto the very tip of the well. These protected wells are usually known as kakhids.\n\nIn writing of parganah Bhagwanpur, Mr. Wynne remarks\u2014\"Considering the nearness of water to the surface, I was at first incredulous as to the impossibility of using kuchcha wells far more extensively, but by digging two experimental wells in different places, I found that after irrigating about one-fourth of a bigha the lower portion became quicksand, in which sand and water were mixed inseparably, and that almost immediately afterwards the whole fell in. Indeed, I must here remark that, as a general rule, there is in this respect (the adaptability of the soil for the digging of kuchcha wells) a very great difference between the lands west and those east of the Hindan. In the former, the facility is practically only limited by the number of cattle and the labour available; nearer to the Hindan the well is more expensive, but can still be dug with advantage; but across the Hindan to the east there is, speaking broadly, only one tract (that down the centre of N\u00e1gal and north of Deoband) where kuchcha wells can be used freely, and to the east of Tahsil R\u00farki they are unknown in the uplands. I may here mention another striking difference between the methods of irrigation east and west of the Hindan. To the east, the use of the leathern 'bag' is universal, to the west that of the Persian wheel. I have never seen a Persian wheel east, and have rarely seen a leather bag used west of the Hindan. The cause assigned in answer to my enquiries was that it required relays of three men, all hard tasked, to work the 'charas' (leather bag); and only a man and a boy (the latter hardly tasked at all) to work the 'harat' (Persian wheel). The inference which I was told to draw, was that labour was more scanty to the west. This however is not the case, but rather the reverse, as will be seen by looking over the percentages of agricultural population. The true inference is, I think, that the people are (as is, indeed, the fact) more indolent in the tract to the west. There can be no doubt that the charas does more work than the other.\" Ogals or mere water-holes are used in the kh\u00e9dir.\n\nIn 1870 we have seen that more than one-half of the irrigated area was Canals. watered by canals, comprising the greater portion of parganahs Sah\u00e1r\u00e1npur and R\u00e1mpur, and considerable areas in parganahs Faizabad, Sult\u00e1npur, Sars\u00e1wa, Nak\u00far, Gangoh and N\u00e1gal. The area irrigated by the Eastern Jumna Canal is much more extensive than that supplied with water by the Ganges Canal, which has a comparatively short irrigating course in this district.\n\nDuring the exceptional year of drought, 1860-61, the area irrigated by the Ganges Canal in this district was, for the khar\u00edf of 1861, 6,470 acres, and for the rabi of 1862, 12,627 acres; from the Eastern Jumna Canal the returns show\u2014khar\u00edf of 1861, 28,368 acres, and\nrabi of 1862, 52,635 acres. On the Ganges Canal, the kharif of 1862 gives 7,677 acres; rabi of 1863, 2,793 acres; kharif of 1863, 3,904 acres; and rabi of 1864, 8,180 acres. A similar falling off is shown on the Jumna Canal,\u2014the rabi of 1863 fell to 21,488 acres, and in 1864 the irrigated area during the same season only amounted to 14,149 acres. There was, again, a great increase during the drought of 1868-69, when the total average area irrigated reached its maximum, and a corresponding decrease in the following years of ordinary and abundant rainfall.\n\nThe following table gives the irrigated area for each season in the parganas watered by the Ganges Canal in this district:\n\n| Year | Jawalapur | B\u00fcrkl | Manglaur | Deoband | Bhagwanpur | Total |\n|------|-----------|-------|----------|---------|------------|-------|\n|      | Acres     | Acres | Acres    | Acres   | Acres      | Acres |\n| 1866-67 | ...       | ...   | ...      | ...     | ...        | ...   |\n| Kharif | ...       | 1,186 | 88       | 5,113   | 1,518      | 84    | 7,939 |\n| Rabi   | ...       | 2,907 | 140      | 7,790   | 3,353      | 180   | 14,350 |\n| Total  | ...       | 4,093 | 178      | 13,903  | 4,861      | 214   | 22,189 |\n| 1867-68 | ...       | ...   | ...      | ...     | ...        | ...   |\n| Kharif | ...       | 1,727 | 61       | 6,899   | 2,518      | 124   | 11,339 |\n| Rabi   | ...       | 2,442 | 27       | 4,113   | 2,108      | 59    | 6,749 |\n| Total  | ...       | 4,169 | 88       | 11,012  | 4,626      | 183   | 20,078 |\n| 1868-69 | ...       | ...   | ...      | ...     | ...        | ...   |\n| Kharif | ...       | 2,310 | 50       | 5,776   | 2,938      | 92    | 10,516 |\n| Rabi   | ...       | 10,890| 3,097    | 16,925  | 5,477      | 401   | 34,690 |\n| Total  | ...       | 13,200| 3,147    | 21,601  | 7,765      | 493   | 45,206 |\n| 1869-70 | ...       | ...   | ...      | ...     | ...        | ...   |\n| Kharif | ...       | 3,996 | 258      | 7,605   | 2,289      | 175   | 14,352 |\n| Rabi   | ...       | 2,148 | 26       | 2,547   | 1,799      | 19    | 6,589 |\n| Total  | ...       | 6,074 | 284      | 10,152  | 4,088      | 194   | 20,792 |\n| 1870-71 | ...       | ...   | ...      | ...     | ...        | ...   |\n| Kharif | ...       | 3,107 | 103      | 5,143   | 1,681      | 104   | 10,188 |\n| Rabi   | ...       | 2,043 | 91       | 5,086   | 1,536      | 87    | 9,723 |\n| Total  | ...       | 5,150 | 194      | 10,229  | 4,217      | 191   | 19,911 |\n| 1871-72 | ...       | ...   | ...      | ...     | ...        | ...   |\n| Kharif | ...       | 1,373 | 84       | 4,475   | 1,551      | 113   | 7,545 |\n| Rabi   | ...       | 1,432 | 61       | 4,276   | 2,848      | 51    | 8,158 |\n| Total  | ...       | 2,794 | 95       | 8,751   | 3,899      | 164   | 15,708 |\n| 1872-73 | ...       | ...   | ...      | ...     | ...        | ...   |\n| Kharif | ...       | 1,403 | 69       | 5,286   | 1,734      | 108   | 9,550 |\n| Rabi   | ...       | 840  | 50       | 2,542   | 1,405      | 31    | 4,835 |\n| Total  | ...       | 2,243 | 99       | 7,778   | 3,139      | 139   | 13,388 |\nAs early as 1856-57, the area irrigated by the Eastern Jumna Canal amounted to 17,470 acres in this district. Its work during the last seven years is shown below. It may, however, be remarked here that, owing to defects in construction and the difficulties presented by the natural obstacles which pass its line, the Jumna Canal has undoubtedly, in some places, been the means of producing prejudicial effects upon the health of the people:\n\n| Year | Kharif | Rabi | Total |\n|------|--------|------|-------|\n|      | Acres  | Acres| Acres |\n| 1866-67 |        |      |       |\n| Khari | 385    | 46   | 7,786 |\n| Rabi | 1,904  | 50   | 13,187|\n| Total| 1,638  | 96   | 20,978|\n| 1867-68 |        |      |       |\n| Khari | 618    | 57   | 11,148|\n| Rabi | 1,081  | 67   | 10,743|\n| Total| 1,699  | 124  | 21,890|\n| 1868-69 |        |      |       |\n| Khari | 1,869  | 84   | 12,065|\n| Rabi | 4,218  | 277  | 21,716|\n| Total| 6,087  | 361  | 33,772|\n| 1869-70 |        |      |       |\n| Khari | 1,364  | 71   | 14,834|\n| Rabi | 1,171  |      | 9,881 |\n| Total| 2,541  | 71   | 24,615|\n| 1870-71 |        |      |       |\n| Khari | 1,016  | 80   | 11,490|\n| Rabi | 1,117  | 9    | 7,986 |\n| Total| 2,133  | 89   | 19,476|\n| 1871-72 |        |      |       |\n| Khari | 613    | 46   | 6,349 |\n| Rabi | 404    |      | 6,946 |\n| Total| 1,017  | 46   | 13,195|\n| 1872-73 |        |      |       |\n| Khari | 594    | 88   | 8,553 |\n| Rabi | 667    | 11   | 8,350 |\n| Total| 1,261  | 99   | 16,783|\nIn 1836-37 A.D., 126 out of 204 villages traversed by the Duab Canal, and only 24 villages not immediately on its banks, received water. Some of these were either held free of revenue or were not then under settlement. In 81 villages which Mr. Thornton examined, only 5,030 acres were irrigated by the Duab Canal, and the Ganges Canal was not then in existence. In 1854-58, the measurement papers show 164,911 acres, or 21.9 per cent. of the total cultivated area received water from all sources, most of which was from wells. In 1865-66, the canal irrigation reached 48,546 acres, which rose to 96,041 acres in 1866-67; 83,899 acres in 1867-68; 153,873 acres in 1868-69; 107,310 acres in 1869-70; 87,994 acres in 1870-71; 67,876 acres in 1871-72, and 72,514 acres in 1872-73. The increase from 1867-68 to 1869-70 is due to the drought of those years. How much of this was given to lands previously dry, and how much has superseded well-irrigation has not been ascertained, but freshly irrigated land may be put down at more than one-half the total area irrigated by canals. The proportion of well irrigation to canal irrigation may also be estimated at two-thirds.\n\nIn 1838 Mr. Thornton estimated the increase of revenue due to canal irrigation on the 5,030 acres he examined at Rs. 1,177 or 3 annas 8\u00bd pie per acre. In the Saharanpur Tahsil, Mr. Robertson attributed Rs. 19,505 of his assessment to the action of canals on 28,071 acres, giving an influence of 11 annas 1\u00bd pie per acre. He does not explain the method by which he arrived at this result. Mr. Wynne in the remaining three tahsils claims Rs. 59,864 as due to canal irrigation on 68,652 acres, which thus gives an increase of 13 annas 1\u00bd pie per acre. This result was obtained by deducting the rates assessed upon unirrigated land with similar capabilities in the neighbouring villages from that assessed upon the canal-irrigated land. \"This calculation can only be correct if it were assumed that all the irrigation is from canals, and that there was no well-irrigation previously which canals have superseded. No information is given on these points.\"\n\nThe canal department calculates the increase of land revenue due to canal irrigation during 1872-73 at Rs. 79,369 in this district, and credit Rs. 64,106 to the Eastern Jumna Canal, and Rs. 15,263 to the Ganges Canal. The influence of the canal has been exercised to more advantage even than causing an increase in the land-revenue. Its civilising effects on the hitherto unruly and singularly uncontrollable Gujjar clans has been mentioned in the notice of parganahs Gangoh and Rampur. The same beneficial results are generally observable throughout the canal irrigated tracts in other parganahs. As a rule, the people have become more thrifty and more industrious in view of the certain return for labour now insured to them, whether the season be unfavourable or not. Similarly, in the adjoining district of Muzaffarnagar, the\nsettlement officer writes:\u2014\"The chief caste in the trans-Hindan villages are G\u00fajars, wonderfully transformed by the canal, and in some degree respectable themselves, though not the cause of respectability in others. They find agriculture more profitable than thieving; but they harbour Kah\u00e1rs and others who live by roguery, and are always ready to pass on a stolen buffalo, or foil the inquiries of a police officer.\"\n\nThe cultivated area has steadily increased in the last twenty-five years, and continues to progress, more especially towards the north of the district. The following table gives the statistics at different periods:\n\n| Year | Assessed Area | Unassessed Area | Rate per Acre |\n|------|---------------|-----------------|---------------|\n|      | Total acres   | Cultivated     | Culturable    | Revenue-free | Barren | Revenue demand in rupees | On total area | On assessed area | On unassessed area |\n|      |               |                 |               |              |        |                           | Rs. a.p.     | Rs. a.p.         | Rs. a.p.          |\n| 1848 | ...           | 1,385,696       | 681,117       | 841,812      | 80,407 | 339,563                    | 1,646.47     | 0 12 6 1 0 8 1 9 1 |\n| 1853 | ...           | 1,383,898       | 774,253       | 211,449      | 54,597 | 343,599                    | 1,646.47     | 0 12 4 1 2 1 6 0 |\n| 1865 | ...           | 1,425,825       | 781,867       | 302,923      | 219,651| 231,385                    | 1,646.47     | 0 12 3 1 1 9 1 6 5 |\n| 1866 | ...           | 1,081,763       | 745,178       | 194,320      | 129,788| 129,477                    | 1,646.47     | 0 12 3 1 1 9 1 6 5 |\n| 1873 | ...           | 1,420,194       | 797,675       | 205,937      | 109,739| 306,853                    | 1,646.47     | 0 15 3 1 5 7 1 11 2 |\n\nThe figures for 1866 exclude from the total area the Siw\u00e1l\u00edk tract. In 1888 the cultivated area started with 606,847 acres under cultivation. There have been modifications of boundaries since then, so that comparison until 1853 is impossible. Of the whole culturable area, 79 per cent. is now under cultivation; 21\u00b79 per cent. of the cultivated area of revenue-paying estates is irrigated, and 31\u00b77 per cent. of revenue-free estates. In 1872, 395,174 acres were under spring crops, and 402,501 acres under rain crops. It is remarkable that, as early as 1842, 314 estates had attained to such a state of cultivation that a pledge was given that the assessment should not be raised until the revenue-rate on the contiguous villages exceeded the incidence of the revenue-rate in these estates. This pledge was observed at the recent settlement.\n\n---\n\n1 From Settlement Report, 1870, which does not give the total area, or materials from which it can be discovered. The area there given is 1,078,511 acres, of which 13,682 are revenue-free, 142,037 barren, and 923,674 assessed. The totals of three statements relating to the same areas do not agree.\nIn 1806-7 there were 30,093 bighas, or about 15,000 acres under cotton as the district then stood. In 1838 the cotton area was three per cent. of the total cultivated area; and in 1866, in three tahsils it had risen to 8\u00b71 per cent., owing to the high prices during the American war. It has since fallen considerably. Wheat and barley are, however, the most important crops of all; in 1806-7 A.D., they occupied 320,300 bighas, or about 160,200 acres, and yielded 28 per cent. of the revenue. In 1838 the area cultivated for these cereals amounted to 30 per cent. of the total cultivated area; and in 1866 in three tahsils to 31\u00b77 per cent. In 1869-70 there were 262,652 acres under wheat and barley, or 33\u00b77 per cent. of the total cultivated area of the whole district.\n\nThe rice area in 1866 in the Nakur, Deoband and Rurki Tahsils amounted to 12\u00b705 per cent. of the total area. In the d\u0101kar tracts of Sult\u0101npur, and in the villages lying along the old bed of the Jumna, chahora rice, known by its long drooping ears, is grown. The rice grown from D\u0101sa Mazra to Manoharpur, in the same parganah, is very good, but inferior to that produced along the K\u0101tha in Nakur, and near Titron in Gangoh, which, next to the chahora, is the best in the district. Oil-seeds occupy a comparatively unimportant position amongst the agricultural products, showing under 7,000 acres in 1869-70.\n\nMr. Guthrie estimated the export of sugar in 1805-6 to be 53,151 maunds, which rose to 88,883 maunds in the following year.\n\nTaking 12 maunds of g\u016br to the local bigha, his calculation gives 7,407 bighas, or 3,700 acres, as under cane cultivation in 1806-7, exclusive of the considerable area of which the produce was consumed in the district. Taking the local consumption at one-third of the gross produce, the total area under cane amounted to 11,110 bighas, or about 6,000 acres and estimating a maund of g\u016br to be then worth Rs. 2\u00b74, the value of the produce exported is somewhat less than two lakhs of rupees, or one-eighth of the revenue. Mr. Guthrie subsequently gives the number of bighas under cultivation in revenue-paying estates in 1214 fa\u1e63\u1e6d\u012b (1806-7 A.D.) as 22,291, or 11,200 acres, yielding 266,500 maunds of g\u016br, valued at Rs. 6,01,875, or 18\u00b77 per cent. of the revenue. The proportion of the total cultivated area under cane was 1\u00b75. At Mr. Thornton\u2019s settlement the proportion was 5\u00b70, and in 1866 it was 4\u00b78. The sugar-cane grown in the villages watered by the Eastern Jumna Canal in Parganah Sult\u0101npur is of a very fine description, but inferior to the species known as menthi, grown near Titron in Gangoh, and Libarheri in Parganah Manglaur.\n\nThe capricious nature of the rain-fall in the mountains above often produces sudden floods in the Ganges and Jumna, and 13\u00b721 inches of rain have been known to fall within the 24\nhours at Dhanauri, a canal post five miles from the foot of the Siw\u00e1l\u00edks. In spite of this, nothing approaching an inundation has ever occurred; but along the Jumna, villages, or portions of them, have been frequently transferred from one side of the river to the other. In all such cases the rule observed is that of *m\u0101chcha \u015b\u012bn*, i.e., the deep stream of the river is the invariable boundary line whatever course the river may take. This is also the rule generally observed on the banks of minor streams. The number of villages liable to fluvial action is said to be\u2014on the Jumna, 97; Ganges, 32; other streams, 201,\u2014total 330.\n\nThroughout the west of Gangoh and Nakur, and (to a less degree) of S\u012brs\u0101wa,\n\nWild animals. the crops, in former years, were exposed to considerable injury from herds of antelope, but these have, in a great measure, disappeared. Throughout the Pathari Nadi forest in Parganah Jav\u00e1lapur, and in the forests along the foot of the Siw\u00e1l\u00edks, herds of wild elephants are met with; and great damage is done by wild pigs both here and in the Ganges kh\u00e1dir.\n\nAn outline of the general history of the famines in these provinces has been given in the introduction, and here it will only be necessary to give the local history of the three great famines of late years\u20141837-38, 1860-61 and 1868-69. During the hot weather of 1837, the first symptoms of the approaching scarcity were shown by the prolongation of the hot westerly winds, which continued to blow on into July and August. There were some few showers in September, and the land remained dry and untilled, except where the Eastern Jumna Canal supplied water for a few acres and the low-lying lands in the kh\u00e1dirs of the great rivers possessed some natural moisture. From Meerut downwards the famine was most severely felt; but were it not that a copious shower fell in this district in February 1838, it would have suffered equally severely with the more southern districts. As it was, the remissions for 1245-46 *fasi* (1837-38 to 1838-39) amounted to Rs. 1,03,264 in this district alone.\n\nThe famine of 1860-61, however, fell with much more force on this district. Up to the 13th of July, 1860, scarcely a drop of rain had fallen in the Du\u00e1b, and in a few days afterwards, instructions were issued for the organisation of relief works should the anticipations of scarcity be fulfilled. In this district the principal work undertaken by the relief committee was the construction of a road from R\u00farki to Dehra, through the Mohand pass. About the middle of December 1860, the first batches of labourers came to the works, principally from Sah\u00e1r\u00e1npur. \"Wretchedly wan and hunger-stricken were these poor creatures, who would have died on the road had it not been for the gratuitous support which Government officials were ordered to afford them. When they arrived at the rendezvous, many were in the last stage of exhaustion, and could do but little at first to earn\na livelihood. For the first month the engineers reported that the price at which the work was done was very high. Earth-work, which, under ordinary circumstances, was accomplished at the rate of Rs. 1-6 per 1,000 cubic feet, cost treble that sum, and the most sanguine person did not expect that the value would ever be less than Rs. 2 per 1,000 cubic feet, whilst the Lieutenant-Governor acknowledged that he should be satisfied if an average of Rs. 3 per 1,000 cubic feet was maintained. When once the fact was generally known that employment was to be had, the people flocked rapidly to the scene of labour.\"\n\nBy the end of January their numbers had increased to 10,500. Besides these able-bodied poor, 17,640 persons, including the old, infirm, and children of tender years, were relieved during January, 1861. The distress went on increasing in intensity until July, 1861, and up to that period 231,066 persons had been relieved, at a cost of Rs. 15,248, giving a daily average of 1,540 persons in receipt of poor-house relief, and an average daily expenditure of Rs. 437. Of the sum expended, Rs. 7,959 were supplied by local donations and subscriptions. The R\u00farki and Dehra road during the same period supported 2,951,424 souls, at an expenditure of Rs. 2,50,636. After July the people were busied with the rain-crops, and the number of paupers at once began to diminish. The people set to work to restore the cultivation, and in this they were assisted by a grant of Rs. 20,000 to purchase seed-grain, implements, and plough-cattle. The loss in life and cattle must have been very severe, for Sah\u00e1ranpur felt the drought intensely. Balances amounting to Rs. 2,19,300 accrued, and of this portion, the realisation of Rs. 1,39,842 was postponed indefinitely. Up to 1865, the sum of Rs. 37,149 had been remitted altogether on account of 1860-61. The influence of the great canals had a great effect in mitigating the intensity of the scarcity in this district, so that in two-fifths of the district there was an average spring crop in 1861. The total receipts for relief operations amounted to Rs. 58,550, of which Rs. 29,832 were expended in general relief, Rs. 20,000 in purchasing seed-grain and implements, and Rs. 5,000 on minor works.\n\nThe drought of 1868-69 was severely felt in the district. \"Plentiful rain fell in July, 1868, and land was extensively sown, but during August there were only a few showers in the central parganahs of Sah\u00e1ranpur, R\u00farki, and Nak\u00far.\" In September a hot wind blew, the air was filled with dust, and the weather was such as might have been looked for in April and May. The storm which spread over so large a portion of the Du\u00e1b did not reach Sah\u00e1ranpur, but a few showers here and there improved whatever remained of the khar\u00edf crops, and enabled farmers to prepare for the rab\u00ed sowings. Speaking generally, but little of the autumn\n\n---\n\n1 See Girdlestone and Henvey's Famine Reports, from which this account has been compiled.\nsowings came to maturity, except in the neighbourhood of the canals, and the rabi area was greatly restricted. On this point some details have been given by the Collector. The decrease of cultivation compared with the average is estimated at nearly 200,000 acres, or about 25 per cent., but this decrease was entirely on dry land, for the irrigated area was increased by 40,995 acres. The cold-weather rains came late, but in time to be of great benefit to the crops. Mr. Webster, the Collector, in an official report, states:\u2014\u201cThe spring harvest had been sown almost exclusively in such lands as possessed means of irrigation, or, from their nature, or conformation, or situation, retained a supply of moisture sufficient to warrant a reasonable hope of successful sowing. The higher and sandy tracts, where irrigation was absent, remained for the most part unsown, or, if they were sown, the seed did not germinate. In irrigated tracts the crops were fair, and when, in the latter half of January, heavy rain, followed by repeated genial showers, fell all over the district, the crops which were alive were so invigorated that there was quite an average outturn per acre in the land sown in which the seed germinated.\u201d The official estimate of the spring harvest put \u201cbarley at an average crop; wheat, two-thirds; and gram, a total failure. With the rains of 1869, which were timely and abundant, all anxiety for agricultural prospects ceased.\u201d\n\nAs soon as the Sindh, Panjab and Delhi Railway was opened, a trade in grain commenced with the Panjab on the west, and the Lower Doab on the south. Up to July, 1869, 162,300 maunds of wheat and barley were exported from Saharanpur, against an import of 147,700 maunds of gram, Indian-corn and wheat. Mr. Henvey writes\u2014\u201cThe markets were unsteady and sensitive. It was some time before the low level of other districts was attained, but the effect of this drought is visible in the price-currents of December, when wheat was at 10\u00bd sers. There was a marked fall in January, and the rain of February kept prices moderately low until the harvest. But in July the prevailing scarcity made itself severely felt: wheat rose to 12\u00bd sers. Again, in August, 1869, a temporary apprehension of a second season of drought sufficed to send wheat up to 10\u00bd sers, and the closing prices of the year were extremely high. The coarser grains were as dear as wheat and barley. For a short time, immediately after the kharif harvest, joar and bajra were fairly cheap, but in November and December, 1868, these grains were scarcely procurable; and although the opening of the railway encouraged considerable importations, the prices of joar and bajra quoted during July, August, and September, 1869, \u2014eight sers for the rupee\u2014denote exhaustion of stocks.\u201d\n\nScarcity brought on distress with the beginning of 1869. Poor-houses were opened, and relief works commenced, so that by the middle of January, 2,400 people were employed near Saharanpur on the roads and streets; 29 miles of road from Manglaur to\nR\u00e1inipur were also commenced, besides a road by the Timli pass to K\u00e1lsi and Chakr\u00e1ta. The daily average on the famine works for 77 days, from January to March, 1869, gave 2,948 souls, at a cost of Rs. 23,925, of which Government gave Rs. 3,941, the remainder being defrayed from the Municipal and Local Funds. At the same time the average number supported by gratuitous relief between the 13th January and the 31st May (138 days), was 161, at a cost of Rs. 2,795. These figures show that there was no wide-spread distress; and when the rains came down, the numbers on the famine works fell to nothing. Some Rs. 60,343 were also given as advances for the construction of wells in tracts to which canal-irrigation could not be brought, and for the purchase of seed-grain and plough-cattle.

Its origin is principally due to the efforts of Doctor Govan, Civil Surgeon of the station, who suggested the advisability of utilising an old garden called the Farhatbaksh, laid out under the Rohilla Government, by devoting it to scientific subjects. The Marquis of Hastings was then (1816) Governor-General; and, whilst making a tour in the upper provinces, was informed of the design, and not only approved of it, but sanctioned an establishment being entertained for its support. Accordingly the Farhatbaksh garden was transformed into the botanical garden in 1817. Doctor Govan was appointed the first Superintendent, and was succeeded by Doctor Royle in 1823. Doctor Felconer took the latter's place in 1831, and was followed by the present Superintendent Doctor Jameson.\n\nThe gardens, exclusive of the farm, are as nearly as possible 3,000 feet long by 2,000 feet broad; the whole being laid out with many fine walks and carriage-roads. Doctor Royle described the choice of situation as showing much judgment, Saharanpur being nearly the northern limit of the flora of India, and southern border of that which is called the Oriental or Persian region. The tropical situation of the Calcutta garden considerably limited its use for economical purposes, whilst the proximity of the Himalayas rendered Saharanpur peculiarly fitted for the acclimatization and cultivation of the plants of other countries; and in a short time Doctor Royle was able to report\u2014\"We have collected in one place, and naturalised in the open air, various fruit-trees of very different countries, as of India, China, Kabul, Europe and America.\"\n\nIn 1826 a medical garden was added, and a nursery in connection with it was formed in Mussooree. A few years afterwards the charge for the medical garden was abolished, and sundry other reductions enforced by the minute frugality of Lord William Bentinck. The effect of this cutting down was subsequently found to be a diminution of the utility of the establishment. Lord Auckland manifested great anxiety for the success of the institution, and a strong desire to restore its efficiency, deeming this important, as well because the garden was an object of great interest to the inhabitants, as on the ground of its obvious tendency to the extension of knowledge, and to the promotion of the benefit both of Asia and Europe. Steam navigation was at this period beginning to display its advantages as a connecting link between Great Britain and her possessions in India; and thus were opened facilities, previously unknown, for the interchange of the seeds, plants and trees of the two quarters of the world, to the advancement of agricultural, horticultural, and botanical science, and to the probable increase of the comforts and gratification of the tastes of the inhabitants of countries widely separated by distance, thus making them mutually contributory to the wants of each other, and co-labourers in diffusing the elements of enjoyment, physical and intellectual. To effect the necessary improvement involved a small additional expense, but the representations of\nthe Governor-General were effectual; and in 1840 the Court of Directors gave their sanction to measures for placing the establishment of the garden in such a state as should insure its efficiency for the purposes for which it was maintained. The total cost of all the gardens, including Saharanpur, Dehra, Mussooree, Hawalbagh, Chajauri and Ayartoli, during 1872-73, amounted to Rs. 45,127, against a cash income of Rs. 4,961, leaving a balance of Rs. 40,166 to represent the net cost of the gardens to the State.\n\nThe gardens have been eminently successful under their superintendents, and have fully answered the expectations of the founder. Not to speak of purely scientific botany, remarkable results have been obtained in the naturalization of useful plants, fruit trees and timber trees collected from all quarters of the globe. The effect is one palpable to the most casual observer who visits this charming locality. In the department of agriculture proper, so much has not been done as might have been expected; but then a more liberal allowance of space, which means also money, would be indispensable to progress in this line.\n\nDuring 1872-73, 37,393 fruit trees, 156,766 flowering shrubs, and 5,530 parcels of seeds were distributed. The Canal Department, the Calcutta gardens, cantonments, cemeteries, soldiers' gardens, the Kew gardens, and public gardens like those at Delhi, Jaipur, Bangalor, Sattara, &c., all participated in the distribution. The Medical Department was supplied with 207lbs. of extract of *hyoeyamus*, 224lbs. of the dried leaves of the same plant, 1,409lbs. of the tubers of *Aconitum heterophyllum* (*atis*), 148lbs. of oak bark, and 64lbs. of *Kamela* (*Rottlera tinctoria*) powder. For the purposes of experiment, 35 acres were sown with the rhea grass, and much of this was used in the trial of the machines entered to compete for Lord Mayo's prize for the best fibre-cleaning machine. Only two machines were exhibited, and one of these was withdrawn as quite unfit for properly cleaning the fibre. The second machine, entered by Mr. J. Greig of Edinburgh, was tried for eleven days on 3\u00bd tons of rhea stems in the presence of Colonel Hyde. The machine weighs 1\u00bd tons, the fly-wheel alone weighing 4 cwt. Attached to the machine is a scutcher (of the ordinary kind used in flax mills), five feet in diameter, having five blades, and making 260 revolutions a minute. All the fibre, after passing through the machine, has also to be cleaned by the scutcher, to remove the small portions of the stalk and green bark not taken off by the first process, and found adhering to the fibre after it has left the first machine. The fibre is turned out very wet from the machine, and it is necessary to dry it in a free current of air. If the fibre is scutched wet, a second scutching becomes necessary when it is dried. In the work of producing 2 cwt. of fibre, 207lbs. were turned out in 37 hours, which gives 5\u00bdlbs. per hour. This trial gave 63lbs. per ton of stems, or 138lbs. of fibre per acre, the outturn by hand being\nabout 200lbs. per ton. In summing up the working of the machine, Colonel Hyde states:\u2014\"The machine is a bona fide meritorious attempt to meet the want that the Government has set forth as existing. I do not think the machine is successful, or that it will continue in its present shape; but I believe that its construction and working cannot fail to advance the question, and to prove a considerable step towards solving the difficulty of producing a machine that will prepare the rhea fibre.\" An American machine (Roeil's patent), belonging to Government, is of a much simpler construction, but it is also very defective, and does not turn out the fibre in a properly cleaned state. To grow the plant is a very easy matter. Dr. Jameson writes:\u2014\"It requires rich, well-drained, and manured land, and, occasionally, irrigation. It yields four crops annually, and each crop may be estimated at about two-and-half tons of green stems, or ten tons per acre per annum; and estimating the yield per ton of fibre at 112lbs., we would thus have half a ton of fibre per acre, which, at \u00a345 per ton, would yield \u00a322-10 per acre, and thus afford a considerable profit to both grower and preparer.\" Though no machine has as yet been made to properly clean the fibre, it can easily be prepared by hand with a blunt knife, and in this manner can still be utilised.\n\nThe other experiments in economic botany carried on through the gardens, are the cultivation of cinchona, potatoes, Carolina rice, black Tartary oats, mulberries for silk-worms, fruit-trees, vegetables, and tea. The cinchona plants were distributed over Kumaun, Garhw\u0101l, and the Dehra D\u016bn, in the Government plantations, and a private company established gardens in the Kangra valley of the Panj\u0101b. The results were all unfavourable,\u2014the plants were completely destroyed by frost. Dr. Jameson writes:\u2014\"The cultivation has now received a fair, patient, attentive, and prolonged trial by experienced and practical hands, and the results fully show that cinchona cultivation can never become of any practical value, in an economical point of view, in the d\u016bns or hills of these provinces or the Panj\u0101b, and in no locality where frost exists during the cold weather will it succeed. In the plains the hot moist weather met with during the rains is equally hostile to this genus of plants.\" The Kangra and Government plantations have since been abandoned. Potatoe cultivation has of late years spread rapidly all over these provinces, and the Sah\u0101ranpur gardens assisted by the introduction of fresh seed and new varieties. Experiments with Carolina rice have proved successful, giving a return of 27 maunds per acre, or 39 bushels of 56lbs. each. Black Tartary oats do not seem to be adapted to this country, and hitherto the experiments show little signs of success. Large numbers of mulberry trees of the Morus multicaulis and Morus Chinensis varieties have been planted out in the Dehra D\u016bn with great success, and some efforts have recently been made there to establish sericulture on a sound basis. Various kinds of\nvines, apples, pears, quinces, peaches, apricots, nectarines, cherries, figs, raspberries and gooseberries, sweet chestnuts, timber trees, and vegetables, have been extensively propagated and distributed.\n\nThe subject of tea will be taken up with the hill districts; but as it is intimately connected with the Saharanpur gardens, some notice of it is required here. Dr. Jameson, in his report for 1872-73, writes:\u2014\u201cTea cultivation progresses, but it is no longer carried on by Government, as private enterprise now fully occupies the field. A fine trade is now springing up with Central Asia. Panjab and Afghan merchants now visit the different plantations in the hills and duns, and offer good paying prices for tea at the factories, and at the same time make their own arrangements for packing and transmitting the teas to the Panjab. To make the tea plantations of Kumaun, Garhwal, Dehra Dun, and the Panjab pay, good markets alone were wanting, as the teas there grown will always compete favourably with those grown in the much moister climate of Assam, Cachar, and Darjeeling, where green teas are prepared with difficulty. For these reasons the tea factories of the North-West Provinces and Panjab will always be able to command the markets of Central Asia, as green teas are the only ones in demand by the Panjab and Kabul traders. It, too, is a significant fact, that Indian teas have attracted the attention of the Russian Government, and favourable transit duties promised. For this part of India we may, therefore, expect to see a more rapid extension of the cultivation. To open up the Central Asian tea trade we have long made strenuous efforts, and urged for years two of the largest tea firms of Amritsar to direct their attention to these markets. By them, for years, many thousands of pounds of teas manufactured in the Government factories have been purchased. The advance of the Russians, too, in Central Asia has, no doubt, tended to develop this market, the limits of which are not bound by tens of millions of pounds. The time, therefore, is not far distant when the produce of the hill districts will become as important to the State as those of the plains, and India a powerful rival to China in the markets.\u201d\n\nThe mineral products of the Siwalik hills are insignificant, viz., carbonate of lime cementing the sandstone, a little selenite, and pyrites. The tufaceous limestone of the plains has been already mentioned. Stone hard enough to be used for building purposes is scarce; pieces of sufficiently strong consistency to be thus utilised may here and there be picked out of the Siwalik sandstone stratum; but although most of the houses in Hardwar and Kankhal are built of materials so procured, the quantity extracted is not large enough to repay the expense of carriage to a long distance. Stone for building is obtained from Agra, at an average cost of 4 annas per 100 cubic feet,\nand carriage by rail at three annas per 100 maunds per mile. Stone for road metal is found in the beds of the Sol\u00e1ni (Kand\u00far), Hindan, and Sukhr\u00e1o streams.\n\nLarge bricks, burned in flame kilns as at Shaikhpura, cost from eight to ten rupees per 1,000; and in ordinary pej\u00e1vas, from six to eight rupees. Small native bricks cost one rupee per 1,000. All these prices vary with the quality. Fresh lime from Dehra, brought to Sah\u00e1r\u00e1npur and slaked there, fetches Rs. 27 per 100 cubic feet. Excellent lime is procurable from the boulders covering the beds of the hill torrents; and amongst the kunkur pits noted for their good quality may be mentioned those at Kumbh\u00e1rhera, Dh\u00fal\u00e1hera (parganah Sars\u00e1wa), Zainpur, Raghu\u0144\u00e1thpur (parganah Nak\u00far), M\u00fan\u00edkpur, Telipura (parganah Sult\u00e1npur), Tikraul (parganah R\u00e1mpur), and Baj\u00faheri. The quarry at Belra, in parganah R\u00farki, is a bad one.\n\nS\u00e1l logs cost Rs. 4 per cubic foot landed at Sah\u00e1r\u00e1npur,\u2014an excessively high rate considering its nearness to the base of supply in Garhw\u00e1l and the D\u00fan. One hundred cubic feet of kunkur cost, for digging and breaking to from 1 to 2\u00bd inch cubes and stacking on the road, Rs. 2; carriage per mile, 10 annas; and consolidation, one rupee; or total Rs. 3-10. As an average, stone metalling costs Rs. 4-8,\u2014for collection of boulders for one hundred cubic feet of metal, 2 annas; carriage, 10 annas per mile; breaking, Rs. 2-8; consolidation, Rs. 1-4. For some roads boulders are brought by the Ganges Canal from Hardw\u00e1r at 5 annas per 100 cubic feet per mile, and stone is now used on the three main roads, to Chakr\u00e1ta, to Dehra, and from R\u00farki to Dehra. Stone metalled roads are, however, inferior to those made with kunkur.\n\n---\n\n**PART III.**\n\n**INHABITANTS OF THE DISTRICT.**\n\nThe earliest enumeration of which records remain is that of 1848, which gives the population at 547,353 souls, distributed as follows:\u2014Hind\u00fas: agricultural, 273,543; non-agricultural, 62,971; including 3,708 labourers employed on the Ganges Canal, who may not have been residents of the district; Muhammadans: agricultural, 139,907; non-agricultural, 70,932; the total giving 253 souls to the square mile. There were 1,447 inhabited, and 449 uninhabited villages. Of the former, 1,370 had less than 1,000 inhabitants; 72 had between 1,000 and 5,000 inhabitants; and those above 5,000 were Jaw\u00e1l\u00e1pur with 8,862; Manglaur, 5,959; Gangoh, 6,260; Deoband, 11,634; and Sah\u00e1r\u00e1npur, 34,294 inhabitants.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 Shakespeare's Memoir on the Statistics, N.-W.

With the distribution of the population according to sex, age, and religion, the statistics of 1872 may be given for the purpose of comparison:\n\n| Class | Agricultural | Non-Agricultural |\n|-------|--------------|------------------|\n|       | Males | Females | Males | Females |\n| Adults | Boys | Adults | Girls | Total | Adults | Boys | Adults | Girls | Total |\n| Hind\u00fas | 123,871 | 79,906 | 84,946 | 68,430 | 31,968 | 306,816 | 218,123 | 175,928 | 177,174 | 183,483 | 110,268 | 61,925 | 376,323 | 604,423 |\n| Muslims and others | 58,383 | 32,763 | 19,288 | 47,847 | 27,311 | 104,030 | 69,131 | 57,202 | 56,645 | 83,190 | 54,545 | 30,431 | 176,819 | 274,445 |\n| Total | 182,254 | 112,657 | 132,593 | 66,650 | 47,806 | 313,846 | 204,254 | 183,230 | 133,719 | 266,632 | 104,843 | 92,343 | 554,135 | 883,782 |\n\nThe figures for 1872 give the total number of each sex according to occupation, without distinction of age. The number of villages recorded amounted to 1,514, of which 1,340 had a population less than 1,000; 165 had a population between 1,000 and 5,000; and the remainder, having more than 5,000 inhabitants, were\u2014Landhaura, 5,118; Ambahta, 6,336; R\u00farki, 7,588; R\u00e1mpur, 8,464; Jaw\u00e1l\u00e1pur, 9,665; Manglaur, 10,206; Gangoh, 10,899; Deoband, 21,714; and Sah\u00e1ranpur, 44,119.

Three villages were subsequently taken up by Government, leaving 1,930 estates in 1863.\n\nThe census of 1872 gives a total population of 884,017 souls, or 399 to the square mile. Of these, 604,422 were Hind\u00fas; 279,015 were Musalm\u00e1ns; and 345 were Christians, and others not included in the first two classes. There were 1,736 villages, giving an average of 0\u00b78 villages to each square mile, and 509 inhabitants to each village. The actual classification of villages shows 627 with less than 200 inhabitants; 579 with from 200 to 500; 363 with from 500 to 1,000; 128 with from 1,000 to 2,000; and 30 with from 3,000 to 5,000 inhabitants.

The columns referring to the total population discard the difference of religion, but retain the sex distinction.\n\n| Ages          | Hind\u00fas | Musalm\u00e1ns | Total population |\n|---------------|--------|-----------|------------------|\n|               | Males  | Percentage on total Hind\u00fas | Females | Percentage on total Hind\u00fas | Males  | Percentage on total Musalm\u00e1ns | Females | Percentage on total Musalm\u00e1ns | Males  | Percentage on total population | Females | Percentage on total population |\n| Up to 1 year  | 14,149 | 4\u00b72       | 19,273 | 4\u00b75       | 6,592 | 4\u00b74       | 6,101 | 4\u00b76       | 20,747 | 4\u00b72       | 18,385 | 4\u00b76       |\n| Between 1 and 6 | 46,086 | 13\u00b77     | 38,646 | 14\u00b73     | 20,131 | 13\u00b75     | 18,377 | 14\u00b70     | 66,244 | 13\u00b76     | 57,044 | 14\u00b73     |\n| \" 6 \" 12      | 57,501 | 17\u00b71     | 89,977 | 14\u00b78     | 25,735 | 17\u00b73     | 19,366 | 14\u00b78     | 83,267 | 17\u00b71     | 59,367 | 14\u00b79     |\n| \" 12 \" 20     | 56,410 | 16\u00b77     | 40,475 | 15\u00b71     | 23,471 | 15\u00b71     | 19,978 | 15\u00b72     | 19,913 | 16\u00b74     | 60,479 | 15\u00b71     |\n| \" 20 \" 30     | 67,288 | 20\u00b70     | 55,317 | 20\u00b76     | 29,083 | 19\u00b76     | 26,543 | 20\u00b73     | 96,412 | 19\u00b78     | 81,897 | 20\u00b75     |\n| \" 30 \" 40     | 47,061 | 14\u00b70     | 38,734 | 14\u00b74     | 20,652 | 13\u00b79     | 18,437 | 14\u00b70     | 67,746 | 13\u00b79     | 57,177 | 14\u00b73     |\n| \" 40 \" 50     | 27,217 | 8\u00b71      | 23,509 | 8\u00b77      | 12,718 | 8\u00b76      | 11,918 | 9\u00b71      | 39,946 | 8\u00b72      | 35,433 | 8\u00b79      |\n| \" 50 \" 60     | 13,548 | 4\u00b70      | 12,284 | 4\u00b75      | 6,461 | 4\u00b73      | 6,077 | 4\u00b76      | 20,016 | 4\u00b71      | 18,362 | 4\u00b76      |\n| Above 60 years | 6,734 | 2\u00b70      | 7,919 | 2\u00b76      | 3,479 | 2\u00b73      | 3,906 | 2\u00b79      | 10,217 | 2\u00b71      | 11,130 | 2\u00b78      |\n\nThe proportion of Hindu males under twelve to the total Hindu population is 35\u00b70 per cent., and of Hindu females is 35\u00b74 per cent.; amongst Musalm\u00e1ns the percentages are 33\u00b79 and 33\u00b76 per cent. respectively. Taking the quinquennial periods up to 15 years of age, or 0 to 5, 5 to 10 and 10 to 15 years, the percentage of both sexes to the total population is 15\u00b77, 13\u00b75 and 10\u00b79 respectively; or, taking females alone, the numbers are 16\u00b72, 13\u00b70, and 9\u00b73 per cent. Here, as in other districts of this division, females are slightly in excess in the first period, and considerably below the males in the third period, the figures for which are\u2014males 12\u00b73 per cent., and females, 10\u00b72. Again, taking the whole population of the same sex and religion only, the proportion of Hindu males of\nthe ages of 10 to 13 to all the Hindu males is 7\u00b70, and of Hindu females is 5\u00b73; whilst Musalm\u00e1ns show 8\u00b70 and 5\u00b70 per cent. respectively. The proportion of Hindu males between 13 and 20 years of age to the total number of the same sex and religion is 16\u00b78 per cent., and of Hindu females is 14\u00b72; the Musalm\u00e1ns for these ages show 13\u00b79 and 14\u00b78 per cent. Taking the proportion of ages for the quinquennial periods in Austria, both sexes show 13\u00b70 per cent. from 0 to 5, 10\u00b78 from 5 to 10, and 9\u00b79 from 10 to 15 years of age, whilst the proportion of females to the entire population gives 12\u00b78, 10\u00b77, and 9\u00b77 per cent. respectively. In Sah\u00e1r\u00e1npur the females are in excess of the Austrian standard in the first two periods, and slightly below it in the third. For the reasons given under the head of population in the Meerut district, the life statistics of these provinces more nearly approach the Austro-Italian than the English standard, and the higher we go in the scale, the more close is the resemblance.\n\nDistributing the Hind\u00fas amongst the four great classes into which they are commonly divided, the census of 1872 shows 45,148 Brahmans, of whom 20,283 are females; 27,420 Rajputs (10,564 females); 36,694 Baniyas (16,396 females); and, as in the other districts of these provinces, the great mass of the population is included amongst 'the other castes' of the census returns, who show 495,160 persons, of whom 221,185 are females. The Brahmans belong for the most part to the great Gaur sub-division, who number 41,023 souls. The Brahmans trace their origin to the old kingdom of Gaur; and, in common with the older inhabitants of this district, say that they settled here in the fourteenth or fifteenth century. They hold a fair proportion of land in the district. Other sub-divisions are the Aoh\u00e1ra\u00ed (951), Saras\u00fat (424), Bh\u00e1t (257), Gujr\u00e1ti (225), Kanaujiya (194), Dakaut (170), Bharadw\u00e1j (145), and San\u00e1dh (55). The Bang\u00e1li, Gata, Mah\u00e1r\u00e1st, Sarwariya, Tilang, and Sangaldwipa sub-divisions number less than 50 souls each, and 1,653 are returned without specification. At the recent settlement, Brahmans held two entire villages in each of the parganahs of Sah\u00e1r\u00e1npur, Haraura, and Muzaffarabad, besides shares in other villages, and 18,899 acres in other parts of the district.\n\nThe most numerous clan of Rajputs in Sah\u00e1r\u00e1npur is the Pund\u00edr, who number 14,843 souls. They own a cluster of thirty-six villages in the tract known as the K\u00e1tha, once a separate parganah, and now distributed amongst parganahs Deoband, N\u00e9g\u00e1l and R\u00e1mpur. In their midst there is one small colony of Maw\u00e1ls. The term R\u00e1n-gar, a word of doubtful meaning, which is sometimes incorrectly stated to be the term applied to converts to Isl\u00e1m, is here usually given to the Pund\u00edrs of the K\u00e1thas. They are a fine hardy race, and in former times were much given to help themselves from the\nproperty of their neighbours. In this respect they were worse than the Gujars, and, like them, were powerful by reason of their union amongst themselves. Whilst other clans have fallen a prey to the usurer, the Pundirs have comparatively escaped scot-free. Mr. Wynne writes\u2014\"Confident in their power of combination, the Pundirs used to resist the police and revenue authorities by open force. A steadily-continued course of the severest punishment at last broke their stiffneckedness, and also reduced them to a state of destitution, from which they are now, however, gradually recovering. They are still notorious cattle-lifters, and protect many Sansiys and other professional thieves.\" These men, moreover, are equally distinguished by their pride. In the famine of 1860-61 they preferred to die in their homes rather than seek aid at the central station only 20 miles off. Infanticide, too, is very common amongst them. The Pundirs intermarry with the Janghars. Their more ancient settlements were to the north, in the tract known as Raotala, the country of the Raos or Rawats, i.e., the relatives of the Rana or chief. This extends from the uplands to the Jumna, running along the skirts of the town of Saharanpur. There is a tradition of a chaurasi in this direction, which is probably the same as the Rangar chaurasi which Sir H. M. Elliot places in the Kutha. In the town of Jaurasi, which the same writer connects with chaurasi, the Pundirs are still the principal residents. In the Rampr parganah they are, next to the Gujars, the most important race, and once held a cluster of twelve villages, still named the Nathabarah. Mr. Williams considers that the Mawals are the only other pure Rajputs in the district.\n\nThe other tribes entered as Rajputs in the district census are the Bargujars (88), Bais (187), Banaphar (57), Bargoti (149), Chandrabansi (78), Gahlot (149), Gaur (95), Jaiswari (75), Jander (135), Jhotiyana (133), Kachhwaha (69), Nagbansi (71), Narauliya (287), Panwar (74), Rahtar (92), Solankhi (65), Taar (119), and Vashisht (409). The following clans have less than fifty members each in this district, viz., Bhil, Bharadwaj, Bhanwag, Chandel, Chhonkar, Dahima, Gaharwar, Gautam, Gohil, Janghara, Jadon, Jadiyana, Jhala, Kinwar, Kathariya, Karanwal, Kharag, Kasyp, Mohil Pahari, Raikwar, Rawat, Roh, Ronakhet, Raghubansi, Surajbansi, Sawant, and Tanak, while 1,175 are unspecified. At the recent settlement, Rajputs held three entire villages in parganah Saharanpur, 13 in Haraura, 21 in Faizabad, and 10 in Muzaffarabad, besides shares in other villages, and 67,645 acres in other parganahs of the district.\n\nThe mercantile classes consist chiefly of Agarwals, who number 25,560; next to them come the Sarangis or Jains (2,864), and next the Bishnoi sect (1,271). The other sub-divisions found\n\n---\n\n1 A caste whose profession is burglary.  \n2 Cluster of eight-four villages.  \n3 Beames' Elliot, II, 51.\nin this district are the Chhoti Saran (382), Dh\u00fasar (18), Dasa (403), Gindauriya (60), Gata (601), Garg (532), Goyel (670), Mahesri (36), Mithal (201), Sangal (639), and Satal (212), whilst 3,246 are unspecified. The Mah\u00e1jans, thanks to the British rule, now form an important body amongst the landowners in this district;\u2014at the recent settlement they held nine entire villages in parganah Sah\u00e1r\u00e1npur, ten in Haraura, seventeen in Faizabad, and twenty-two in Muzafarabad, besides 87,376 acres in other parts of the district. The Agarw\u00e1ls settled here from \u00c1gar\u00f3ha, on the borders of Hari\u00e1na, about 1400 A.D., and the Dh\u00fasars, from Riwari in G\u00fargaon about 1840 A.D.\n\nThe following list gives the names and numbers of the other castes found in the district in 1872. Many of these names are the names of trades rather than castes, the members whereof, however, comprise separate communities, having in many respects distinctions similar to those observed amongst the acknowledged castes. Cham\u00e1rs, when forsaking their hereditary occupation as curriers or cultivators, frequently change their caste name, becoming Moch\u00eds when working as shoe-makers, Beld\u00e1rs when skilled excavators, Bandhan\u00eds when removing stones from quarries, R\u00e9j Mistries when masons, &c.\u2014\n\n| Aheriya | 1,147 |\n| Abir | 6,189 |\n| Banjara | 2,932 |\n| Bansphor | 39 |\n| Baranwar | 10 |\n| Barhai | 15,216 |\n| Bart | 71 |\n| B\u00e9dar | 300 |\n| Bhadri | 256 |\n| Bharbh\u00faja | 1,728 |\n| Bh\u00e1t | 1,798 |\n| Bhartia | 77 |\n| Bisati | 44 |\n| Bohra | 923 |\n| Cham\u00e1r | 1,54,859 |\n| Chhipi | 5,806 |\n| Chh\u00fa\u00e1n | 10,076 |\n| Daigur | 14 |\n| Darzi | 2,062 |\n| Dhanak | 6 |\n| Dhobi | 35,7 |\n| Dh\u00fana | 578 |\n| Dom | 70 |\n| Gaderia | 10,556 |\n| Ghool | 3 |\n| G\u00fajar | 53,876 |\n| Hajjam | 8,068 |\n| Jalaw\u00e1r | 80 |\n| J\u00e1t | 12,588 |\n| Jul\u00e1hah | 9,191 |\n| Kachhi | 216 |\n\n| Kab\u00e1r | 89,794 |\n| Kal\u00e1l | 2,148 |\n| Kambo | 2,534 |\n| Ka\u00edjar | 362 |\n| Kanpri | 152 |\n| Kalath | 1,466 |\n| Kh\u00e1gi | 2 |\n| Kh\u00fakhab | 25,146 |\n| Kh\u00fakk | 1,966 |\n| Khattri | 2,616 |\n| Kis\u00e1n | 2 |\n| Koli | 6,982 |\n| Kumh\u00e1r | 14,70 |\n| Kurn\u00ed | 453 |\n| Kuz\u00e1ghar | 12 |\n| Loh\u00e1r | 3,160 |\n| Loh\u00e1r | 7,762 |\n| Main\u00e1r | 1,129 |\n| Mali | 16,276 |\n| Mall\u00e1h | 178 |\n| Manih\u00e1r | 18 |\n| Mewafarooh | 688 |\n| Mochi | 496 |\n| Niarfiya | 29 |\n| Nunera | 1,002 |\n| Orh | 2,690 |\n| Padah\u00e1 | 298 |\n| P\u00e1s\u00ed | 866 |\n| Patwa | 504 |\n| Poj | 40 |\n\n| Ra\u00edn | 1 |\n| Ramaia | 116 |\n| R\u00e1ngar | 5 |\n| Rangres | 26 |\n| Raw\u00e1 | 136 |\n| Keahangar | 19 |\n| Ilwari | 2 |\n| Saind | 2,197 |\n| Saini | 29,637 |\n| Shoragar | 1 |\n| Sikh | 20 |\n| Singhariya | 23 |\n| Sun\u00e1r | 4,719 |\n| Taga | 15,208 |\n| Tamboli | 139 |\n| Tark\u00e1l | 8 |\n| Teli | 211 |\n| Thathera | 49 |\n| Vaishnu | 94 |\n| Bairagi | 1,171 |\n| Barwa | 99 |\n| Brahmach\u00e1ri | 5 |\n| Harandasi | 6 |\n| Fak\u00edr | 487 |\n| Gosh\u00e1in | 1,611 |\n| Jogi | 8,751 |\n| Kabirpanthi | 25 |\n| Ud\u00e1si | 135 |\n| S\u00e1dh | 279 |\n| San\u00e1di | 16 |\n| Pah\u00e1ri | 41 |\n| Purabiy\u00e1 | 25 |\n\nThe Aheriyas are a jungle-living clan who practise fowling and hunting. The Ah\u00edrs possess five villages in Haraura, and 2,367 acres in other parganahs. They are amongst the oldest inhabitants, and trace their origin to Muttra and\nRewari in Gurgaon. The Banj\u0101ras or Banj\u0101ras say they settled here some 400 years ago. Bansphors, or workers in bambu, are natives of the district, who assumed the name of their trade as a caste name some 150 years ago. Barhais are carpenters, and Beld\u0101rs are expert labourers. Bisatis came here from Kairana in the neighbouring district of Muzaffarnagar; Bharbh\u016bnjas or grain-parchers derive their origin from Bhatner in Sarsa; Bohras came from Marwar 90 years ago, and Bairagis from Ujain about 500 years ago. These last hold over 5,000 acres of land, whilst the Bhats, who came here at the same time, have 186 acres as proprietors. Cham\u0101ras, who comprise the great mass of the rural labouring population, possess a few acres as landholders. The Chauhans belong to the nondescript clan noticed under the Meerut district who follow the practice of karao, like the Jats and Gujars, and are never considered as true Rajputs, though they bear the name of Chauhans and have adopted many of the usages of that clan. They are commonly called Khagis here, and their principal gots are the Janu and Tabakchandi. The Chhipis are cloth-printers, who came from the Panjab. The Darzi is a tailor, and the Dhobi a washerman, many of whom came from Jodhpur. The Gadariyas are shepherds, who came from the Panjab.\n\nThe Gujars and the Tagas form the characteristic element amongst the Hindu population of the Upper Doab. In this district the Gujars number 53,576 souls; in Meerut, 60,350; in Muzaffarnagar, 24,899; in Bulandshahr, 48,786; and in Aligarh, 640. In the Rohilkhand Division they number 39,488 souls; in the Agra Division, 19,835; in the Jhansi Division, 6,956; and further south their numbers are insignificant, except in the wilds of Mirzapur, where we find a colony of 2,698 souls. Altogether there are, according to the 1872 census, 258,855 Gujars in these Provinces. The Gujars as a clan bear a bad character for turbulence and cattle-lifting. Sir H. M. Elliot mentions that a great part of the present district of Saharanpur was called Gujrat during the last century. The Gujars themselves divide the district into three parts, and use these divisions in common conversation. The first, known as Ghar, comprises the tract of lowlands from the bangar or uplands to the Ganges on the east. The second, from the uplands to the Jamuna on the west, is known as Raotala. The remainder of the district, with the exception of the tract known as the Katha and inhabited by the Pundirs, is known as Gujrat. Gujrat extends down to Kairana and Jhanjana in the Muzaffarnagar district, and comprises Gangoh and the old parganas of Lakhnauti, Nanauta and Titron, now included in Rampur, Nakur, Gangoh and the neighbouring parganas of Muzaffarnagar. A part\n\n---\n\n1 These proximate dates are the results of inquiries made by the late Mr. H. D. Robertson, C. S., whilst Collector of the district in 1866. The Banj\u0101ras, though often passing through the district as carriers in olden times, have only settled here very recently.\nof this tract, occupied by the Kh\u00fabar got, to which Raja Ramday\u00e1l of Landhaura belonged, is known as Badanon, \"a name,\" says Elliot,1 \"affixed by themselves, in order to feed their vanity of being reputed men of either lofty stature or eminent in war or council.\" The same writer adds, the G\u00fajar \"estimate of 125,000 subordinate villages within Gujrat alone must vanish when it comes to be examined. Three thousand is the utmost they could have possessed. They might, perhaps, have doubled that, had they included the tract called Tal\u00e1yin, which extended from Hastin\u00e1pur and Bahsuma in a semi-circle to the south of Meerut up to B\u00e1gp\u00e1t. The G\u00fajars of this tract were despised, chiefly because they shaved, and did not live in such a lordly fashion. The tract opposite Dehli, from Loni to K\u00e1sna, was called Bhatner, from the prevalence of the Bhatti G\u00fajars.\"\n\nThe principal gots of the Chhonkar sub-division of the G\u00fajars are the Likar, Basila, and Chhaori. They hold twelve villages near Titron on the Muzaffarnagar border still nearly intact, and known as the b\u00e1rah Chhonkaron ka. They say that they are descended from a J\u00e1tan Rajp\u00fat and a woman of inferior lineage. The chief gots of the great Kosas sub-division of the G\u00fajars in this district are the Kh\u00fabar, Basla or Basila, Bat\u00e1r, Chahum\u00e1n, Kals\u00e1n, Mardsa, Dholi, Gori, Kath\u00e1n, R\u00e1wal, Deora, Kut\u00e1na, Chhaori, Lodhi, B\u00e1gri, Chabni, Chhabchak, Dubl\u00e1k, Nur\u00e1la, Bahr\u00e1na, Khala, Kota, Ghugla, Bijbir\u00e1na, Cho\u00e1na, N\u00fan, K\u00e1ns, D\u00e1pa, Rahtor, Chanb\u00e1n, Pasw\u00e1l, Jangal, Kab\u00e1ri, Sakh\u00fan, Dharw\u00e1l, Kh\u00fari, Chamchi, Misw\u00e1l, Shagli, and Bh\u00e1r-kala. The Bat\u00e1rs held a baoni or cluster of fifty-two villages in Gangoh and Lakhnauti. The Pandir and other gots contain quite as large a number of subdivisions in this district. Nearly all intermarry with each other, the only prohibited gots being those of the father, mother, and paternal and maternal grandmothers. The G\u00fajars are the principal landowners in Sah\u00e1ranpur, and hold five entire villages and shares in others in each of the parganahs of Sah\u00e1ranpur and Muzaffarabad, besides 138,896 acres in other parganahs, especially R\u00e1mpur, Sars\u00e1wa, Sult\u00e1npur, Nakf\u00far and Gangoh. They are still bad cultivators; but, as in the Meerut District, they seem to improve when living near the industrious J\u00e1ts, and when brought under the civilising influence of canal irrigation.\n\nG\u00fajars are numerous in the Dehli and adjacent districts of the Panj\u00e1b and as far west as the Indus. In the Du\u00e1b they say that they came from the west some 500 years ago, and almost universally claim descent as a mixed race from Rajp\u00fat fathers and women of other tribes. The J\u00e1ts, too, assert for themselves a similar origin in the west, and both are coupled together in the well-known proverb:\n\n\"J\u00e1t, Gadariya, G\u00e9jar, Gola,\nIn charon ke hela mela,\"\n\n1 Beames' Elliot, I, 100.\nwhich ascribes a commonalty of interest, custom and origin to the four tribes mentioned. Together these tribes form one-half the population of the Panjab. General Cunningham identifies the G\u00fajars with the Yuchi or Yuetchi, a branch of the Tungnu or Eastern Tartars, who, several centuries before the Christian era, founded an extensive empire in Western Tartary, now comprised in Tangut, West Kansu, and Thiangshan. About 200 B.C., the Yuchi were defeated by Mothe, chief of the Hiungnu, who became paramount between the Volga and the frontier of China. During the first half of the second century before Christ, the Hiungnu continued their career of progress and drove before them the Yuchi. The latter divided into two hordes; the little Yuchi occupied Tibet, and the great Yuchi the country along the Jaxartes, until further pressed they moved west and south upon Kashgar, Yarkand and Khoten. Hence they went further to the south and west to Sogdiana and Tahia, or the country of the Dahae. In the beginning of the first century before Christ, Khieu-tsiu-ki, king of the Kuei-shwang tribe of the great Yuchi, united all the five tribes of the nation together, and conquered the country from Gandhara (Peshawar) on the east to the borders of Persia on the west, and from the Hindukush on the north to Bactristan on the south. He took Kaofu and Kipin from the Sakas and Hantha. The power of the Yuchi remained unimpaired until their overthrow by the Ephthalites or white Huns, in 222 A.D. The last king of the Yuchi mentioned in history is Kitolo, whose son made Peshawar the capital of their kingdom.\n\nSo far the history of the Yuchi from Chinese sources. Lassen identifies the Tochari and Asiani of Strabo with the Yuchi and Kuei-shwang above-mentioned; and General Cunningham identifies the latter with the Kushan and Khushan of coins, and the Gushan of inscriptions. The medallic form of the name often appears as Korsou, Koreea, Khoransu and Korano; the first three exclusively on the coins of Kadaphes or Kadphizes, the successor of Hermecus, and the last on the series minted by Kanerki and his successors. General Cunningham thinks it probable that the name which is intended in the first three readings may still be found in Khorasan; and if this view be correct, the original name of the tribe must have been Kors or Khorans, which was afterwards softened to Kor and Kush, or Korano and Kushan. He adds\u2014\"In all these names, I think that we may recognize, without much straining, the original form of the Sanskrit Garjara and the Hindi Gajar or Guzar.\" The statement of the Chinese, that the Yuchi or Tochari occupied the country of the Dahae, is confirmed by Justin with the date 123 B.C., and this would bring their aggrandisement under Khieu-tsiu-ki, or Kujula, or Kujulaka, or Kadphizes, to about 70 B.C. Lassen discusses this identification at greater length. The Tochari were taken into the employment\n\n---\n\n1 See Arche. Sur. II, 61. The remainder of this notice is taken from Cunningham, Prinsep (Ind. Ant.), Elliot (Hist. Ind.) and Lassen (Bactrian coins).\nof Phrahates of Parthia in his expedition against Antiochus of Sida. They arrived too late, and received no compensation, so they plundered the Parthian country and slew Phrahates in 126 B.C. He was succeeded by his uncle Artabanus II. (Arsaces VIII.), who fell in conflict with the Thogari (Tochari) in 123 B.C. Next came the great Mithridates, who again fought the Scythians, but most of his time was taken up by the wars with the Romans, so that the Scythians had then an opportunity to extend their conquests. Lassen places the war of Phrahates IV. with Tiridates, whom he expelled with the aid of the Scythians, in 40 B.C., and the succession of a son of Khieu-tsin-ki in 20 to 25 A.D.\n\nAccording to Ptolemy, the Indo-Scythian empire comprised the country on both sides of the Indus, from Attak to its mouth, and the peninsula of Surashtra or Gujrat. This must be the Yuchi colony founded by Kadphizes or Khieu-tsin-ki on the ruin of the Sak\u00e6, who were destroyed by Vikramaditya in 57 B.C.\n\nSome slight assistance is obtained from the Persian historians. The Tarikh-ul-Hind of Ab\u00fb Rihan al Biruni mentions that Kabul was formerly governed by princes of Turki (or Tochari) lineage for sixty generations. \"The last of them was Katorm\u00e1n, and his minister was Kalar, a Brahman\" who usurped the throne. As it would be beyond the object of this notice to follow out these investigations any further, the reader is referred to the authorities quoted below for the history of the Kabulian kingdoms. This much may be gathered from all the authorities, that a great Scythian tribe, known as the Yuchi, Yuetchi, or Tochari, occupied the country of the Sak\u00e6 in the latter half of the first century before Christ. They invaded India and established themselves along the Indus and in Saurashtra, and in the time of Fa Hian (400 A.D.) their power had greatly declined. With the exception of the Jats, hereafter identified with the Sak\u00e6, there is no other tribe of presumably foreign origin that are numerous enough to represent the Yuchi. The Kaira copper-plates mention three princes of a Gurjara race, the last of whom reigned in 380 Sak\u00e6, or 458 A.D. General Cunningham identifies them with the princes of the Gurjara kingdom mentioned by Huen Thsang, of which the capital was at Balmer, half-way between Amrkot and Jodhpur. They were expelled by the Bhilas about 505 A.D., and shortly afterwards are found in Gujrat. In the Baroda inscription, Indra, Raja of Saurashtra, is said to have conquered the king of Gurjara just one generation before 812 A.D., or between 775 and 800 A.D. These instances show that a powerful colony remained in the countries that we know were once subjected to the Yuchi. We next find traces of a Gujjar kingdom in the district of the Chaj Duab in the Panjab still called Gujardes. This country was attacked by Sankara Varmana, king of Kashmir in A.D. 883, when the Gujjar\n\n---\n\n1 Dowson's Elliot, II., 403-429.  \n2 The founder was Barhtigin, and amongst his successors Kank or Kanishka: Prinsep by Thomas I, 38, 41, 144, &c.  \n3 See Meerut District.  \n4 Thomas's Prinsep, I, 262.\nRaja Alakhana was defeated. This Gurjara lay between Trigartta or Kangra and the country of Sahi, amongst the mountains to the west of the Jhilam.\n\nThen, pressed eastward by the continual advances of the Musalmans, we find the northern G\u00fajars all along the foot of the hills, and, crossing into the Du\u00e1b, they percolated southward as far as Agra; crossing the Jumna at Muttra they keep to the hilly country, and own the native State of Samthar to the west of J\u00e1lann. Across the Ganges they are found in considerable numbers in the wilder parts of Bijnaur, Mur\u00e1dabad and Bareilly, still close to the hills. Whatever value may be attached to these conjectures, the identification of the G\u00fajars with a foreign invading race is at least plausible, and may stand until future investigations show that the theory is ill-founded. As early as 1540 A.D. the G\u00fajars of the Du\u00e1b were powerful enough to interfere with Sher Sh\u00e1h whilst building his fort and mosque at Dehli. Sher Sh\u00e1h himself marched against P\u00e1li and P\u00e1hal and reduced the G\u00fajars to subjection. \"He left orders that they should be expelled from that country; consequently, not a vestige of their habitations was left.\" They however did not attain to any political influence until the middle of the last century, when the foundations of the great mukararis of Rajas Ramday\u00e1l Singh and Nain Singh were laid in the Sah\u00e1ranpur and Meerut Districts.\n\nThe next numerous cultivating tribe is the J\u00e1ts, of whom the clans settled in this district are the most northern off-shoots. The great J\u00e1t country lies further south in the Muzaffarnagar and Meerut Districts, and the colonies settled here are comparatively of recent origin. Hajj\u00e1ms are barbers and Jul\u00e1has are weavers; Kal\u00e1ls possess two villages in parganah Sah\u00e1ranpur, and Kayaths have one village, besides 4,442 acres elsewhere. The Musalm\u00e1n Kal\u00e1ls came from Dehli in the last century, whilst the Hindu Kal\u00e1ls came from the Panj\u00e1b about 1400 A.D. The Kambos came here from Kam\u00fadnagar, 300 years ago. Kanjars are a very low caste usually appearing as vegetable-sellers, and are the same as the Mewa-farosh. Many members of this caste in this district are addicted to thieving, and are found wandering about in gangs, both here and in Muzaffarnagar. Kh\u00e1krobs or Bhang\u00eds are sweepers, and Khat\u00edks are another low caste chiefly given to rearing fowls. Kol\u00eds, Kunh\u00e1rs and K\u00farm\u00eds came here some centuries ago from the Lower Du\u00e1b and Oudh; Kanpris and Kazahgars came from Rohilkhand 400 years ago; and Kah\u00e1rs from Dehli. Very many Lodhas came here from G\u00fargaon in the Panj\u00e1b as labourers when the canal works commenced, and most of these afterwards settled down in the district. The Musalm\u00e1n M\u00e1lis came from Dehli. Mochi is synonymous with Cham\u00e1r. The Nats are a gipsy tribe, Nuneras are salt-makers, and Manih\u00e1rs are workers in glass. The Patw\u00e1s say they came from the Agra district. The Rains came from Ghar Ghazni, and\n\n---\n\n1 T\u00e1rikh-D\u00e1d\u00fai; Dowson's Elliot, IV., 477.\nSaraw\u00e1 in Afghanistan. Rawas are numerous in Meerut. Reshamgar is a trade name meaning silk-worker, Shoragar a saltpetre-maker, Singharia a water-caltrop planter, and Taw\u00e1if a prostitute. The Sain\u00eds, a division of the M\u00e1li or gardener caste, trace their origin to Dehli; they hold one village in parganah Sah\u00e1r\u00e1npur, and 7,569 acres elsewhere. Sun\u00e1rs, or goldsmiths, also from Dehli, hold 196 acres; and Borhs have 6,625 acres in different parganahs, and three whole villages in Haraura.\n\nThe more common gots of Tagas in this district are the Bharadw\u00e1j, Pachas and Kalsig\u00e1n. The Bichhu, Kadha, Mah\u00e1t\u00e1b and B\u00fagarw\u00e1la gots are also tolerably numerous. Tagas, besides numerous shares, possess five entire villages in the Sah\u00e1r\u00e1npur parganah, four in Haraura, and 36,068 acres in other parts of the district. The same legend is told about them here as in Meerut, that they were Brahmins invited to be present at the great snake-sacrifice proclaimed by Raja Janamejaya, and were rewarded with grants of land, for the sake of which they abandoned their priestly character (ty\u00e1g d\u00e9na) and became cultivators of the soil. The Heris or Hiris say that they came from the Lower Provinces, and the Mahras ascribe their origin to Central India, whence they emigrated to this district. Both are jungle-loving tribes, who inhabit the country at the foot of the Siw\u00e1l\u00edk hills to the north of the district, and are found again in the D\u00fan. Though, in common with most other tribes, they claim a Rajp\u00fat descent, there is no evidence forthcoming in support of their pretension. The Tambolis or p\u00e1t-sellers, Telis or oil-makers, and Thatheras or brass-workers, are all immigrants from the Panj\u00e1b. The Vaishnus or Bishnois are more fully noticed under the Meerut district.\n\nThe Musalm\u00e1n population consists both of followers of the different invaders of Northern India and a considerable number of converted Hind\u00fas. In the former class are the Sayyids (5,878), who possess four entire villages in parganah Sah\u00e1r\u00e1npur and three in Haraura, besides 11,689 acres in other parganahs. Mughals (1,721) hold 1,400 acres in the south and east of the district, and Path\u00e1ns (15,263) hold 22,117 acres in the same portions of the district. Shaikhs, who include amongst them many Hindu converts, have nine entire villages in the Sah\u00e1r\u00e1npur parganah, four in Haraura, and one in Faizabad, besides 11,689 acres in other parts of the district. All the abovementioned sub-divisions say that they have settled in this district for the last 500 years. The Musalm\u00e1n G\u00fajars number 9,395 souls, and possess nearly 20,000 acres in Tahsils Nak\u00far, Deoband and R\u00farki; Musalm\u00e1n Rajp\u00fats (12,010) hold 26,619 acres in the same tracts; Musalm\u00e1n Tagas (1,594) hold 2,659 acres. There are also Fak\u00edrs (348), Musalm\u00e1n J\u00e1ts (73), Meos (17), Hajj\u00e1ms, Mall\u00e1hs and Bil\u00faches amongst the Musalm\u00e1n community. 207,516 Musalm\u00e1ns are unclassified in the census returns.\nAmongst them the Jojh\u00e1s and G\u00e1ras deserve a passing notice. The former declare that they assumed the appellation 500 years since; they have two villages in Haraura, and possess 5,339 acres in the southern and eastern tahsils. Some of the G\u00e1ras call themselves Mughals, whilst others say that they are descendants of converted Sombansi Rajputs located here by Akbar. They preserve the names of different Rajput tribes amongst their clans, and are probably the result of the first great proselytising efforts of the Musalmans amongst the mass of the Hindu population. The name G\u00e1ra is probably derived from the new custom adopted by the converts of burying their dead (garna). They usually marry amongst themselves, but one clan is known as the Sayyid G\u00e1ra from the fact that the daughters of these G\u00e1ras are received in marriage by Sayyids. The Pirzadas of Bahat and Ambahta are a distinguished family, and the former still possess one village in Saharanpur and four in Faizabad. Many of the Musalm\u00e1n inhabitants are known by the trades they follow; such as Kam\u00e1ngars or bow-makers, T\u00edrgars or arrow-makers, Paj\u00e1wahgars or lime-burners, converted Kanjaras known as Mewa-faroshan or fruit-sellers, Sab\u00fangars or soap-makers, K\u00e1ghaz\u00eds or paper-makers, Mium\u00e1rs or masons, Kang\u00edgars or comb-makers, Jul\u00e1has or weavers, also called Safed-b\u00e1f and N\u00far-b\u00e1f; Kasais or butchers, Khair\u00e1dis or turners, Atashb\u00e1z or firework-makers, Sikalgars or cutlers, and Bhatiy\u00e1ras or innkeepers. From the example of the Hind\u00fas, these trades are gradually assuming the character of castes, even amongst the Musalmans, and especially amongst those who are descendants of converted Hind\u00fas, who in a great measure retain the customs and prejudices of the clans from which they are derived. The question of caste will be noticed hereafter; here it is sufficient to say that the castes of the present day appear to be a complex, artificial system of very modern growth, and that the celebrated division into four great classes, though adopted for convenience, has no foundation in fact, if the accounts given by each caste of their origin can be relied upon.\n\nChristians are few in number, but hold one entire village in Saharanpur and three in Faizabad, besides 7,538 acres in other parganahs.\n\nThe distribution of the population into the two great divisions of those engaged in cultivating the soil and those following other occupations has been sufficiently noticed. The agriculturists, as a body, will be described hereafter. The whole population was divided into six classes for the purposes of the recent census, each of which was further sub-divided, and included all the male adults (not less than fifteen years of age) employed in the occupations it represented. The first, or professional class, embraces all Government servants and persons following the learned professions, literature, the arts and sciences, and numbered 8,768 male adults, amongst whom are included 7,184 purohits or family priests, 229 pandits, 89 muazzins or reciters of the call to prayer, 30 druggists, 362 musicians, &c. The\nsecond class numbers 38,107 members, and comprised all males engaged in domestic service, such as washermen, personal servants, water-carriers, barbers, sweepers and inn-keepers. The third class represents commerce, and numbered 19,531 males, amongst whom are all persons who buy or sell, keep or lend money and goods of various kinds, as shop-keepers (13,961), money-lenders (1,871), bankers (141), and brokers (83), and all persons engaged in the conveyance of men and animals or goods, as pack-carriers (549), ekas and cart drivers (317), and coolies (359). The fourth class includes persons possessing or working the land as proprietors (16,856), cultivators (94,170), ploughmen (879), and gardeners (210), and every one engaged about animals, as shepherds (706) and herdsmen (990). The fourth class numbers 114,118 male adults. The fifth class, containing 47,417 members, includes all persons engaged in the industrial arts and mechanics, such as patwas or necklace-makers (69), masons (379), carpenters (4,270), and perfumers (55); those engaged in the manufacture of textile fabrics, as cloth-printers (492), weavers (17,806), tailors (2,289), and cotton cleaners (1,033); and those engaged in preparing articles of food or drink, as grain-parchers (675) and confectioners (223), as well as all dealers in animal, vegetable or mineral substances.\n\nThe sixth class contains 71,112 members, including labourers (62,842), persons of independent means (92), and 8,177 persons supported by the community, and of no specified occupation. Altogether there are 299,053 male adults classified according to occupation in this district, of which nearly one-half are engaged in cultivating the soil.\n\nThe description given of the houses, clothing, customs and food of the people under the Meerut district will apply equally well to Saharanpur. It is only necessary to note here any local peculiarities. The census of 1872 show that there were then 79,734 enclosures in the district, of which 49,836 were occupied by Hindus, 29,382 by Musalmans, and 66 by Christians. This shows 35 enclosures to the square mile, and eleven persons to each enclosure. The separate houses numbered 197,235, distributed as follows:\n\n| Class of house                  | Hindu   | Muhammadan | Christian | Total   | Number of Inhabitants |\n|---------------------------------|---------|------------|-----------|---------|-----------------------|\n| Houses built by skilled labour  | 11,763  | 7,434      | 103       | 19,300  | 94,863                 |\n| \" \" unskilled labour            | 131,697 | 56,382     | 6         | 177,055 | 768,919                |\n| Total                           | 183,460 | 63,766     | 109       | 197,235 | 863,783                |\nThis return gives 88 houses to the square mile, and 4\u00b74 inhabitants to each house. The proportion of persons inhabiting the better class of houses is only 10\u00b78 per cent. on the total population, which, while higher than the provincial average, is below Muzaffarnagar and Aligarh. The district averages range from 60\u00b71 in Gurhwal to 0 in the Tarai, or, taking the Duab districts alone, from 21\u00b79 in Cawnpore to 2\u00b79 in Mainpuri. The town houses are of the usual fashion, constructed according to the means of the owner. In villages there are few pukka houses, and in the north of the district, under the Siwalik hills, the huts are exclusively made of grass, as mud of a sufficiently tenacious character to withstand the heavy rains of that tract is not procurable. The only buildings devoted to public worship with any pretensions to architectural beauty are the new mosques at Saharanpur and Deoband and a few temples at Hardwar. The lower classes, as a rule, consume Indian-corn, bajra, jodr, and barley, and those better off eat wheaten unleavened cakes, seasoned with split pulses (dali) and various condiments.\n\nAlthough a remarkably fine mosque in the town of Saharanpur, recently commenced by public subscription, attests the zeal of the Musalm\u00e1n community, and a few Wahabis are undoubtedly found in the city, Muhammadanism does not seem to be making any progress amongst the people; but, on the other hand, Hinduism has received a severe shock, and even the popularity of Hardwar and the Himalayan shrines, or places of pilgrimage, is not so great as before. Christianity, however, has not made its influence felt, and, in fact, the great mass of the people is without any religion of any kind. Civilization, whilst it has sapped the foundations of the old systems of belief, has not given the people anything which can supply their place. This is perhaps a necessary consequence of all progress, but still it is one to be deprecated as containing the germs of some political and social difficulty for the next generation.\n\nThe Ludhi\u00e1na Mission, organised under the care and supervision of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America, extended its operations to Saharanpur as early as the year 1835, when the Reverend J. R. Campbell settled in this station, and laboured conscientiously for many years. He opened an English school in connection with the Mission in 1837. This institution was at first naturally regarded with grave suspicion, and the number of the pupils did not exceed 40; now there are 345. They receive a good sound education, and so alive are the people generally to its advantages, that many of the Munshis in the Collector's office have been educated there. An orphanage was\n\n---\n\n1 From an interesting little book called Missions in Hindustan, by the late Reverend J. R. Campbell, page 160.\n2 Forty-five boarders and 200 day-scholars.\nestablished in the year 1838. For a long time the average number of orphans was not more than 20; now there are 50. In the year 1863, Mrs. Calderwood, the wife of the present Missionary, set up a girls' school, of which there are at present three, with an attendance of from 60 to 70 pupils. In 1849, the members of the Native Church were only eight; there are now 25 or 29, and the whole Native Christian community numbers 302 souls. The Mission premises are commodious, and include an excellent church, with an average congregation of 100. In 1871-72, four converts were gained, and the Reverend A. P. Kelso, while acting for Mr. Calderwood, lately introduced an excellent practice of sending some of the orphans to R\u00fcrki, and apprenticing them to the workshops there for the purpose of learning trades. The S. P. G. F. P. Mission commenced operations at R\u00fcrki in 1862, and has continued them with varying success up to the present time. The school has done much for the town and neighbourhood; and in 1872 the Reverend J. Gavin, Chaplain of R\u00fcrki, who manages the institution with the assistance of a native pastor, baptized six converts from Hinduism. There is no native charitable or literary association in the district.\n\nThere are no dialects peculiar to the district which demand special attention.\n\nLanguage. The inhabitants generally speak remarkably good Urdu, a language with which even most of the peasantry are fairly acquainted, and speak with a degree of purity only to be accounted for by their early intercourse with the Muhammadans. The Banj\u0101ris and S\u0101nsis, who are professional thieves, have a dialect of their own, but that cannot be considered peculiar to the district.\n\nEducation in this district is under the supervision of the Inspector of Education, the first or Meerut Circle, in concert with the local committee, of which the Magistrate is president. The zila school was opened in 1867, and has a boarding-house attached for the accommodation of boys from the interior of the district. The tahsil schools were opened in 1851-54, the halkahbandi village schools in 1860, and the female schools in 1866. The aided schools are under the management of the American Presbyterian Mission already noticed. The towns of Deoband and Sah\u0101ranpur are noted for their large Arabic and Persian schools, which are included under the head \"indigenous.\" In 1850 these schools numbered 133, with 1,367 pupils, and 32 of them had then been in existence for more than ten years. The Sanskrit and Hindi schools at the same time numbered 90, with 1,336 pupils, and of these 35 had been in existence more than ten years. The number of male children under instruction in 1850 was 2,733, or 5\u00b79 per cent. of those between the ages of four and fourteen. The number of pupils under instruction in 1871-72 was 7,934, or 6\u00b72 per cent. of those\nbetween the same ages. The following table gives the statistics for 1860-61 and 1871-72:\n\n| Class of School | 1860-61 | 1871-72 |\n|-----------------|---------|---------|\n|                 | No. of Schools | No. of pupils | Cost | No. of Schools | No. of pupils | Hind\u00fas | Musalm\u00e1ns | Others | Average daily attendance | Cost per head | Proportion borne by State | Total charges |\n| Government (Zila (inferior), Tahsil) | 39 | 541 | 1,492 | 4 | 185 | 91 | 172 | 6 | 9 | 6 | 1 | 1,254 |\n| Halikabandhi (Fangar) | 29 | 511 | 1,331 | 109 | 2,329 | 1,113 | ... | 3 | 10 | 1 | 13 | 11,345 |\n| Anglo-vernalicular (aided) | 1 | 15 | 291 | 7 | 198 | 127 | 59 | 304 | 17 | 6 | 7 | 0 | 5,286 |\n| Female (aided) | ... | ... | 2 | ... | 60 | ... | 57 | 10 | 5 | 4 | 0 | 694 |\n| Indigenous (unaided) | ... | 363 | 4,773 | 12,476 | 243 | 1,633 | 1,662 | ... | 2,601 | 5 | 0 | ... | 13,899 |\n| Total | 399 | 5,639 | 15,590 | 381 | 4,885 | 3,488 | 61 | 6,001 | ... | ... | ... | 36,746 |\n\nIn 1872 an attempt was made to collect the statistics of education amongst Educational statistics\u2014the census. Though confessedly imperfect, the results may be received as a fair indication of the state of education in the district. The statement given below shows the number of Hind\u00fas, Christians and Musalm\u00e1ns of each sex at different ages, and the number who can read and write (literate), with the percentage of the same to the total population of the same religion, sex and age.\n\n| Ages | Hind\u00fas | Musalm\u00e1ns | Christians |\n|------|--------|-----------|-----------|\n|      | Males | Females | Males | Females | Males | Females |\n|      | Number | Literate | Percentage | Number | Literate | Percentage | Number | Literate | Percentage |\n| 1 to 12 years | 117,786 | 537 | 0.4 | 90,896 | 58,453 | 208 | 0.3 | 43,844 | 64 | 2 | 0.3 |\n| 13 to 20 | 58,410 | 795 | 1.4 | 40,475 | 23,471 | 280 | 0.9 | 19,978 | 32 | 2 | 0.9 |\n| Above 20 | 161,848 | 8,444 | 5.2 | 137,063 | 72,095 | 905 | 1.2 | 66,871 | 66 | 65 | 1.2 |\n\nThe girls\u2019 schools must have been able to turn out some of their pupils with the elements of primary education during these years, so that in regard to female education the returns are evidently very imperfect. The total number of males recorded as able to read and write is 6,211, or less than the number\nunder instruction in the previous year. We may, however, gather that there is great room for the increase of schools, and that the activity shown in the matter of education during Sir William Muir's administration was directed towards supplying a want which was really felt. Even if we double the number of persons returned as literate in the district, still this will only give seven in every hundred inhabitants. There is but one native lithographic press in the district, and one English press, at the Thomason College.\n\nThe Post-office statistics for three years in the last decade are shown in the following table:\n\n| Year       | Receipts                                                                 | Charges                                                                 |\n|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|            | Miscellaneous savings, fines.

The number of prisoners admitted in 1860 was 1,251 and 1870 was 785, of whom 15 were females. The number of persons discharged in 1870 was 493. In 1870 there were 444 admissions into hospital, giving a ratio of admissions to average strength of 205:55. Of these 31 died, or 14:35 of the total strength. The cost per prisoner per annum in 1870 was for rations Rs. 17-0-3; clothing Rs. 2-1-8; fixed establishment Rs. 11-15-8; contingent guards Rs. 5-12-0; police guards, Rs. 2-6-10; and additions and repairs Rs. 6-6-10, or a total of Rs. 46-3-9. The total manufactures during the same year amounted to Rs. 1,539, and the average earning of each prisoner to Rs. 7-1-11. In 1870 the Muhammadan prisoners numbered 231, and the Hind\u00fas 447. There were four prisoners under 16 years of age, 494 between 16 and 40, 147 between 40 and 60, and 38 above 60. The occupations of the majority of the male prisoners were - agriculturists, 225, labourers, 273, and shop-keepers, 38.\n\nThe chaukid\u00e1rs or village watchmen numbered 1,624 in 1873, or one to each 447 inhabitants. They have recently been reorganised under the provisions of Act XVI. of 1873, and their cost is now defrayed from the municipal cesses at about the rate of Rs. 3 a month for each man. This, with the re-allocation of the regular police, leaves little to be done for the watch and ward of the district. The regular police during 1873 numbered 843 men of all grades, costing Rs. 95,372 per annum, of which Rs. 71,390 were chargeable to the Provincial Revenue. The proportion of police to area is one to 2:64 square miles, and to the total population is one to every 1,048 inhabitants. The following table shows the statistics of crime for several years, and the mode in which the police have dealt with cases cognizable by them:\n\n| Year | Murder | Dacoity | Robbery | Burglary and theft, &c. | Value of Property | Cases | Persons |\n|------|--------|---------|---------|------------------------|------------------|-------|---------|\n|      |        |         |         |                        |                  |       |         |\n|      |        |         |         |                        |                  |       |         |\n|      |        |         |         |                        |                  |       |         |\n|      |        |         |         |                        |                  |       |         |\n|      |        |         |         |                        |                  |       |         |\n|      |        |         |         |                        |                  |       |         |\n|      |        |         |         |                        |                  |       |         |\n\nThe proportion of persons convicted to persons tried is 77:8.\nIn the more heinous offences the police have been successful in their convictions, but in petty burglaries and thefts, especially cattle thefts, the returns for the last ten years show some inability to grapple with these offences on the part of the police that contrasts unfavourably with other districts. Undoubtedly the presence of a large Gujar community, whose profession is cattle lifting, has much to do with this state of affairs. The scarcity of 1868-69 led to some increase in the number of petty offences during its prevalence, but on the whole there is little abnormal in the crime calendar of this district. There are first-class police-stations at Saharanpur, Gangoh, Roorkee, Fatehpur, Jawalapur, Deoband, and Rampur; second-class stations at Nakur, Bahat, Chikana, and Manglaur; and third-class stations at Sarsawa, Naga, Mohan, Sultanpur, Kunari, Badgaon, Nanauta, Bhagwanpur, Muzaffarabad, Mirzapur, Basi, and Dausni. There are also outposts at Gagalhera, Mandoli, Phandpuri (Rahmanpur), Man Singh ke Tanda, Kankhal, and Hardwar.\n\nAs early as 1853 the question of the existence of the practice of killing female infants amongst the Rajput tribes attracted the attention of the authorities in this district. Mr. Craigie, the Magistrate, set inquiries on foot; but as the Tahsildars reported that the practice had died out, the matter was allowed to drop. In 1862, the Inspector-General of Police recommended the adoption of the rules for repression which had been found so successful in Agra and Mainpuri, and these were introduced with some success into 171 villages amongst the Gujar, Rajputs and the Kalikanthawals (those wearing a black necklace) Jats. One result of the inquiries that were now set on foot was the discovery that the Jats were not so universally guilty as had been supposed. A regular census of the suspected clans was then taken in hand, and the provisions of Act VIII. of 1870 were enforced against the Puodir Rajputs in 64 villages, other Rajputs in 17, Gujars in 136, Jats in 18, Tagas in six and Kolis in one village. Five of these villages recur twice, so that the true number of villages proclaimed in 1871-72 is 237. The special census of the same year gave a total population of 52,375 souls, of whom 11,731 were boys and 5,222 were girls, the percentage of girls to children being only 30.8. The percentage varied from 23 amongst the six villages of the Tagas to 31.8 amongst the Gujars. The returns of 1872-73 show 239 villages on the proclaimed list, inhabited by 52,996 souls. The births during the year were 1,328 boys and 1,273 girls, or 50 per mille of the total population. The deaths of infants under one year recorded during the same period showed 252 boys and 235 girls. The rules drawn up under the Infanticide Act were carefully worked, with the result of the conviction of 49 persons for evasion, whilst 118 inquests were held, and post-mortem examinations were made on the bodies of 21 infants.\n\nIn 1873 the standard of exemption was lowered to 35 per cent. of female children in a village instead of 40 per cent. as before, and the result of the\nrevision of the records in accordance with these orders was found to give 118 G\u00fajar, 50 Pundir (Rajputs), 12 Rajput of other tribes, 19 Taga, 26 J\u00e1t, 10 Koll, and 2 Musalm\u00e1n villages. In June, 1873, 44 villages were added to the list, giving a total of 277, with a population of 51,838 souls, of whom 21,604 were male adults, 13,420 were women; there were 11,396 boys and only 5,418 girls, or 32\u00b72 per cent. of the minor population. These figures show conclusively the necessity that existed for some active interference on the part of Government. The cost of the extra establishment employed is defrayed by a cess on the 2,000 \"blood-red and suspected\" families of one rupee a year, whilst 6,302 families pay one-half that amount. The cess yields Rs. 5,151 per annum, and the expenditure amounts to Rs. 3,960.\n\nAs a rule, the soil is owned by the village communities; the old assignees of the Government revenue and talukad\u00e1rs have disappeared. Besides the money-lenders, there are hardly any men of note amongst the proprietary body at present existing. As Mr. Wynne says, \"the list begins and ends with Raja Raghubir Singh of Landhaura, the Messrs. Powell, and Hamullah Kh\u00e1n of Kail\u00e1sipur.\" Some account of the families which have exercised considerable influence in the district follows, but, with the exception of the Landhaura G\u00fajars and the Ambahta Shaikhs, none of them claim more than a passing notice.\n\nThe Pirz\u00e1dahs of Bahat claim descent from the famous saint Bah\u00e1udd\u00edn Zakariy\u00e1 of Multan, mentioned by Firishta. Their ancestor, Sh\u00e1h Abdullah, is said to have settled at Bahat in the reign of Bahlol Lodi, from whom he received several villages in the neighbourhood free of revenue, for charitable purposes. A religious assembly (urs) is held annually in honour of this personage. At one time the Pirz\u00e1dahs possessed considerable estates as farmers, but for many years they have had barely sufficient to keep up the appearance of respectability. At present the leading man amongst them appears to be Sh\u00e1h Ghul\u00e1m Abb\u00e1s. Some of the descendants of Shaikh Abd\u00fal Kadd\u00fas mentioned in the historical sketch linger in poverty at Gangoh.\n\nThe Ambahta Pirz\u00e1dahs, descended from Sh\u00e1h Ab\u00fal M\u00e1ali, also mentioned hereafter, are tolerably well-to-do. They possess twenty-two villages free of revenue, except some patches of resumed land. Their lands yield, in cash alone, a rental of Rs. 7,152 per annum, but they are much in debt. Their principal men are Sh\u00e1h Ali Ahmad, son of Sh\u00e1h S\u00e1bir Baksh, and Sh\u00e1h Muhammad Kutb-ud-d\u00edn, son of Sh\u00e1h Ghul\u00e1m Sharf. The Shaikha of Raj\u00fapur are a community that once exercised considerable influence in the district. They also claim descent from a famous Musalm\u00e1n saint, Shaikh R\u00e1ju, the founder of the town. One of his descendants, named Shaikh Kal\u00e1n, is celebrated in the fiscal history of the district as an enterprising farmer, whose operations were conducted on\nso extensive a scale as to necessitate the interference of higher authority. His grandsons are now in a condition barely removed from poverty.\n\nIn the Naw\u00e1bganj fort at Sah\u00e1ranpur, the same built by Raja Indargir Naw\u00e1b Shaistah Kh\u00e1n. Goshain, lives an extraordinary character, named Naw\u00e1b Shaistah Kh\u00e1n, who seldom goes abroad, and spends his time in the study of chemistry, or, as some say, alchemy, his object being the discovery of the philosopher's stone, of which he is indeed sadly in need, although the grandson of one of Perron's J\u00e1gird\u00e1rs, and a relative of the Naw\u00e1b of Jhajhar, who had the misfortune of being hanged in the mutiny. When the j\u00e1gir of Jhajhar was confiscated, Shaistah Kh\u00e1n and other loyal members of the family were allowed a small pension, not more than sufficient for them to live upon; and a journey to London, undertaken for the purpose of appealing against the decision of Government, involved him deeply in debt. He returned thence to end his days in poverty at the residence which his grandfather once occupied as commandant of Sah\u00e1ranpur under General Perron.\n\nAmongst the old Musalm\u00e1n talukas broken up since the British occupation of the district, were the jaedd\u00e1s of Nij\u00e1b\u00e1t Ali Kh\u00e1n and Mandal Path\u00e1n in 1806, and the mukarari of Murtaza Kh\u00e1n, consisting of thirty-one villages known as Taluka Patehar in 1813-14.\n\nThe Turkm\u00e1n colony at Lakhnauti, all true Shias, is said to have been founded by a detachment from B\u00e1bar's army. In later days their chief obtained possession of Tappa Kaini, comprising twenty-one villages near Gangoh. This taluka was broken up in 1809, on the death of the last acknowledged chieftain, Bahrmand Ali Kh\u00e1n, who left no male issue, and whose surviving relatives are now in a state of miserable poverty. A colony of Afgh\u00e1ns, under Muhammad Anwar Kh\u00e1n, settled at Patehar in Parganah Sult\u00e1npur, during the Rohilla supremacy, and obtained an estate, which ultimately came to include thirty-four villages. The estate was resumed in 1814, and Ali Ahmad Kh\u00e1n, the present head of the family, is now a tahsild\u00e1r. Pitambar Singh, R\u00e1na of Jusmor, the titular head of the Pundir clan of Rajputs, manages to subsist at the village of Jusmor in the north of the Ra\u00f3tala. The history of his childhood is a tale of rascality and spoliation, for he was left an orphan in his infancy, and the remainder of what had been once a fine estate, comprising villages in the D\u00fan as well as in this district, was nearly all frittered away by dishonest agents. He, too, has little more than a bare subsistence allowance.\n\nOn the high land overlooking the left bank of the Sol\u00e1ni river, about nine miles north-west of R\u00fark\u00ed, stands Sakrauda, once a stronghold of the Musalm\u00e1n Pundirs who bear the\n\n---\n\n1 See subsequently, under fiscal history.  \n2 Comprising Bahat, Jahangirabad, Musafarabad and Sars\u00e1wa.\ntitle of Rao. Under the Rohilla Government, in the time of Z\u00e1b\u00edta Kh\u00e1n, the Sakrauda Raos had sufficient influence to have the lands occupied by them separated from the neighbouring parganah of Jaur\u00e1si under the name of Tappa Sakrauda. This tappa at the settlement in 1839 was found to consist of fifty-five villages, of which only eighteen were cultivated. The remainder was measured off with the large tract included in the K\u00e1srao and Kheri jungles. Mr. Thornton settled sixteen of the cultivated villages with the zamind\u00e1rs, to whom an allowance of ten per cent. on the land revenue was allotted, whilst the m\u00e1lguz\u00e1rs obtained a hereditary and transferable right in their villages. Rao Muhammad Ali Kh\u00e1n is now the leading man of the community. The Kheri tappa had a similar origin, and was owned by the Raos of that place. It contained thirty-nine villages at the settlement in 1839, of which only nine were cultivated, and of these Kheri and Alaw\u00e1lpur are situated on a high isolated piece of land in the centre of the kh\u00e1dir, and the remaining villages lie within the kh\u00e1dir. In the early settlements the entire tappa was considered one estate, and assessed at a very moderate land-revenue. At the fourth settlement an enhancement took place, and B\u00e1bar Kh\u00e1n, the surety for the payment of the revenue, was admitted as m\u00e1lguzar in the following year. In 1820-21 the zamind\u00e1rs recovered their possession, and a settlement for ten years was made with them from 1830-31, after a division was made into four patt\u00eds. Mr. Thornton broke up the tappa by distributing the assessment separately over each of the ten villages that he found possessed of cultivated lands, and by including the remainder in the waste tract placed at the disposal of Government.\n\n(See WASTES.)\n\nRaja R\u00e1mday\u00e1l Singh, the G\u00fajar proprietor of a vast estate held at a fixed revenue (mukarari), was the most important personage in the district at the conquest, and since, he and his family have exercised considerable influence on the progress of events in the Sah\u00e1ranpur District, a more detailed account of his family and their possessions will not be out of place. The Landhaura family trace their origin to one Chaudhri Manohar Singh of the Kh\u00fabar got of G\u00fajars, who received in 1173 hijr\u00ed (1759 A.D.) from Najib Kh\u00e1n, Rohilla, the grant of some 505 villages and 31 hamlets on a fixed revenue. The Rohilla leader was at that time engaged in consolidating his acquisitions in the Upper Du\u00e1b, and was glad to purchase the assistance of such a powerful ally as the head of this great sub-division of the G\u00fajar clan. Manohar Singh was succeeded by L\u00e1l Kunwar, and he by Budh Singh, Mohar Singh and Raja R\u00e1mday\u00e1l, the last of whom was found in possession of 794 villages and 36 hamlets at the British occupation in 1803,\n\n---\n\n1 Set.

This history is also useful in showing how our statesmen got rid of troublesome mushroom-potentates.\nrepresenting the gradual acquisitions of himself and his predecessors in the troubled times of the Rohilla and Marhatta Governments. The Raja then paid a fixed annual revenue amounting to Rs. 1,11,597, which was confirmed to him for life. A list of his villages was obtained from him in 1810 A.D., which showed in the column for proprietors the Raja's own name as proprietor of 496 villages and 31 hamlets; the names of other persons as proprietors of 35 villages and five hamlets; and in the remaining 260 villages this column was left blank, and the villages were therefore known as 'kh\u00e1nakhd\u00ed.' The estate lay for the most part in the Saharanpur District and the northern portions of the Muzaffarnagar District. Raja R\u00e1mday\u00e1l died on the 29th March, 1813, and the revenue of the year 1812-13 was collected direct from the cultivators. The arrangement made with the Raja was only for his life, and the estate then came under a regular settlement. Mr. Chamberlain, the Assistant Collector, was despatched from Meerut to make such inquiries on the spot as were considered necessary. He found that the estate comprised 827 villages and 36 hamlets, in which the Raja's heirs claimed 596 villages and all the hamlets as theirs by right as proprietors, and put forward two farm\u00e1ns, one by the Emperor Aurangzeb and the other by the Emperor Jah\u00e1n Shah, in support of their pretensions. Mr. Chamberlain found that these farm\u00e1ns were forgeries; but that the Raja and his ancestors had been in possession of the 505 villages and 31 hamlets entered in the lease granted by Najib Kh\u00e1n, for nearly sixty years.\n\nThe Board of Commissioners concluded engagements for these villages with Settlement on R\u00e1mday\u00e1l's death. the Raja's heirs, but only as occupants claiming the proprietary right, leaving it to some future period to settle the question between them and those in the villages who claimed the same rights. In those cases where the Raja's heirs acknowledged the proprietary right to be vested in others, the village amind\u00e1rs were ascertained, and the settlement was made with them. The grounds of this temporary postponement of the complete settlement of the estates were apparently a feeling of consideration for the family of R\u00e1mday\u00e1l, both on account of the great alteration that must in any case take place in their circumstances, and also because the deceased Raja had always exerted himself to support the measures of Government. In many of the villages settled with the Raja's heirs, claimants appeared, who were acknowledged to be possessors of the proprietary right; but still their position was ignored for the time being, on the plea that the Raja had asserted his claim to the proprietary title in all these villages by the list he furnished in 1810 A.D., and had held the fiscal management of them for a very long period. It was, moreover, considered to be more expedient that the claims in the entire estate should be investigated and decided upon at one and the same time.\n\n1 Board's Rec., October, 1, 1804, September, 30, 1805.\nAmongst the 505 villages and 31 hamlets taken to form the Landhaura estate Sub-divisions of the in 1815, were five small talukas which the Raja had mukarari made over to a similar number of distant relatives. This distribution was confirmed by the Raja's heirs. Kunwar Siwai Singh, the eldest son of Raja Ramdayal had predeceased his father, leaving a widow, Rani Sada Kunwar, and a son, Badan Singh, by another wife. Disputes arose between these regarding the disposition of the remaining villages, which, at length, were settled by the intervention of Nain Singh as arbitrator, who assigned taluka Thitki to Khushal Singh, the second son, under charge of his mother, Rani Dhan Kunwar, whilst the remainder of the villages were divided into two talukas, and given over to Rani Sada Kunwar and Badan Singh respectively. The subsequent fiscal history of these talukas will best be told from Mr. E. Thornton's accurate and careful report.\n\nTaluka Thitki, held by Khushal Singh, consisted of 239 villages, 17 biswas and 11 hamlets. The Rani entered into engagements for the entire estate, at a revenue for 1221 fauli (1813-14 A.D.) amounting to Rs. 1,90,475, with a progressive increase for the remaining year of the settlement. Mr. Chamberlain, who made this assessment, considered that it would leave the Rani a net profit of Rs. 16,000 a year; but though this was the proportion of the gross assets allowed by the regulations, he considered it insufficient to maintain the rank and situation of the family, and he estimated the profits derivable from 15\u00bd villages held free of revenue at Rs. 15,000, and further recorded that the Rani possessed a large sum in money and Government securities. In November, 1817, Government directed the relinquishment of the progressive increase to the revenue, and the deduction of one-eleventh from the initial assessment, thus leaving the annual charges at Rs. 1,73,405. In November, 1820, the Government further permitted Khushal Singh to continue to hold the 15\u00bd revenue-free villages on the same terms as a mark of favour. The next settlement was made for seven years, 1226 to 1232 fauli (1818-19 to 1824-5 A.D.), and was accepted by the Rani Dhan Kunwar on behalf of her son at the land revenue of 1225 fauli, the last year of the previous settlement. She subsequently refused to abide by the agreement, and the Collector was directed to form a village settlement. Scarcely had this been done when the Rani again applied to be admitted to settlement. Mr. Ross, the Senior Member of the Board of Revenue, was then (1822) on tour in the district, and finding that the Rani had, in the interval between the settlement with herself and that with the village zamindars, successfully used her influence to cause a decrease of cultivation, and compel a reduction of revenue, he considered that whilst she had, by her own act, foregone the position to which she had originally no clear right, it was also in every point of view desirable that the settlement should be made with the village occupants,\nwho at the same time asserted themselves to be proprietors. He proposed, however, that as it had not yet been decided that Khush\u00e1l Singh had not any right in the villages, a sum of five per cent. on the actual collections should be allowed him in addition to the proceeds of the 15\u00bd villages which he then enjoyed free of revenue.\n\nThe sanction of Government to these arrangements was communicated to the Board in Mr. Holt Mackenzie's letter of the 18th July, 1822, but it was also distinctly laid down that the five per cent. allowance on the collections made to the young Raja Khush\u00e1l Singh, and his mother the R\u00e1ni Dhan Kunwar, was not an acknowledgment of right, and that the circumstances of the family were among the considerations which induced Government to accede to the proposal. The error that would have been committed had the taluka of Thitki again been subjected to the R\u00e1ni was strongly insisted on. Subsequently the proprietary right was adjudged to belong to the village zamind\u00e1rs, and not to the mukarr\u00e1dd\u00e1r; the allowance was, however, continued to Khush\u00e1l Singh up to his death. On the death of R\u00e1ni Dhan Kunwar, the question as to the continuance of the allowance to L\u00e1d Kunwar, widow of Khush\u00e1l Singh, was again brought forward, when it was ruled\u00b9 that the allowance was a personal stipend which ceased on the death of the grantee. The revenue-free villages, however, still remained, and were continued to L\u00e1d Kunwar for her life.\u00b2 On her death the proprietary titles were investigated, and settlements were made with the village zamind\u00e1rs.\n\nTaluka Jabarheri fell to R\u00e1ni Sad\u00e1 Kunwar, and consisted of 49 villages and three biswas. She refused to agree to the land revenue on eleven villages, but accepted the remainder, of which the assessment amounted to Rs. 26,578, with a progressive enhancement. As in Thitki, the progressive enhancement was relinquished, and a deduction of one-eleventh made from the revenue by Government in 1817, leaving the assessment at Rs. 24,162. The second settlement for seven years was made by Mr. Moore with the R\u00e1ni on the assessment of the last year of the expired settlement 1225 fa\u0161li or (1817-18, A.D.). In 1822, Mr. Ross proposed this arrangement for confirmation, not on the ground that the R\u00e1ni had been found to possess a right in the villages, but because, whilst few of the village head-men had expressed dissatisfaction at being continued under her and she had regularly discharged the revenue, no sufficient ground was found to exist for taking the fiscal management out of her hands. Government sanctioned Mr. Ross's proposals, but at the same time explained the provisions of Regulation VII of 1822, and pointed out the propriety of at once commencing the detailed settlement of the taluka; the object being the ascertainment and record of\n\n\u00b9 Board, 18th November, 1836, 211. \u00b2 Government to Commissioner of Delhi, September 1st, 1839.\nthe nature of the rights of the persons admitted to settlement under the claim of being proprietors of the individual villages on the one hand, and of the heirs of the late Raja on the other hand. Mr. Ross had simply stated the position of the parties at the time, without detailing the circumstances which had brought them to this position. On this vague statement the Government were led to imagine, from the presence of acknowledged village proprietors side by side with a settlement made with the late Raja's heirs, that there might be a tenure of the nature of a talukaddri existing in the estate. It was to clear up this question, and settle all existing rights, that Mr. Thornton, in 1836, undertook the examination of the settlements of these talukas noticed hereafter.\n\nMr. Turner made the settlement under Regulation VII. of 1822, and assessed a revenue of Rs. 24,000 on the taluka, which took effect from 1241 fa\u0161i (1833-34 A.D.). An arrangement was made for the payment of the balances that had accrued, but these were remitted at the recommendation of Mr. Thornton. Mr. Turner had recorded the R\u00e1ni's inability to undertake the fiscal management of the taluka, and had prevailed on her and R\u00e1ni Dhan Kunwar of Thitki, who had previously been on very bad terms with each other, to come to the following arrangement:\u2014R\u00e1ni Dhan Kunwar was to be jointly responsible with R\u00e1ni Sad\u00e1 Kunwar for the Government revenue, and to take half the net profits that should remain. \"From the gross profits, R\u00e1ni Dhan Kunwar was to deduct the usual percentage for standing security for the moiety of revenue due from the other. She was to advance the instalments as they became due, and deduct the interest due on this account; and she was to repay herself for the expenses of collection,\u2014the actual management being to vest in her. After the death of R\u00e1ni Dhan Kunwar, her heirs R\u00e1ni L\u00e1d Kunwar, &c., took her responsibilities and engagements. R\u00e1ni Sad\u00e1 Kunwar was thus free from keeping up any establishment for the management of the taluka, but of course her profits from it were as small as her partners might choose to make them, still she gained by the reconciliation with the other party, for though she became dependent on their bounty, they treated her well; and besides the resources above mentioned, they still had a large hoard of Raja R\u00e1mday\u00e1l Singh's accumulations stored in their house at Landhaura.\n\n\"The settlement proceedings for this taluka were sent to Mr. Thornton for revision, together with the remainder of the settlements of the estates comprised in the Deoband Tahsild\u00e1ri. The right of the R\u00e1ni had not been investigated, and the amount of her demand on the communities had not been limited, nor even had her actual demand been recorded. Soon after Mr. Grant joined the district as Officiating Collector, the complaints of the village communities led him to call on their representatives for a list of their rentals. In his letters of the 4th and 11th April, 1835, he strongly urged the propriety of a settlement with the\nvillage communities, as did Mr. Lewis in his report of the 9th January, 1836.\" Large balances had accrued for some years, and at length the Board of Revenue directed the Collector to take the management of the taluka into his own hands. It was found that most of the villages had been sublet to the village communities, and by collecting according to these leases for the years 1235-38 fa\u0161li (1827-28 to 1830-31 A.D.), there was realized in excess of the revenue a sum of Rs. 4,122. The examination of the rights in the taluka was made by Mr. Thornton, who found it contained 34 villages. In nine of these the settlement was made with the resident proprietary community. In four small villages, where the R\u00e1ni's ancestors had located the cultivating community, the settlement was made with the residents as proprietors, whilst a malik\u00e1na or proprietary allowance of ten per cent. on the Government demand was allotted to the R\u00e1ni. In three other cases, where the cultivating community opposed the claim of the R\u00e1ni, the dispute was referred to arbitration. Of the remaining eighteen villages, four belonged to N\u00farnagar in the Muzaffarnagar District, and fourteen were settled with the R\u00e1ni in full proprietary right. In most of these villages, however, the remains of an agricultural brotherhood were found, whose lands were transmitted hereditarily. In many of these cases the brotherhood were said to have been originally located by the ancestors of the late Raja R\u00e1mday\u00e1l, and to them the position of hereditary cultivator, with a right of occupancy at a fixed money rate, twenty per cent. above the Government demand, was granted at the settlement.\n\nTaluka Baledh, assigned to Badan Singh, son of Siw\u00e1i and grandson of R\u00e1mday\u00e1l, consisted of twenty-four villages, of which he accepted the assessments made on twenty. At the second settlement for 1226 to 1232 fa\u0161li the taluka was again settled with Badan Singh, but he failed to fulfil his engagements, and a village settlement was made from 1819-20 to 1824-25 (1227 to 1232 fa\u0161li). The only village in which a proprietary right was declared in his favour was Baledh kh\u00e1s, his residence. The village of Babail, which he had held for some time free of revenue, was continued to him, but subsequently the proprietary rights in this village also were found to belong to others.\n\nTaluka K\u00fanja belonged to Kora Singh, and he entered into arrangements for all of the 44 villages it comprised. At the second settlement for 1226 fa\u0161li (1818-19 A.D.), his son, Biji Singh, was admitted to engagements. It was this Biji Singh who harboured the great gang of d\u00e1kait that plundered Bhagw\u00e1npur and the treasure escort from the Jaw\u00e1l\u00e1pur Tahsili in 1824. K\u00fanja was besieged by a party of the Dehra regiment, under the Hon'ble J. Shore and Colonel Young, and a party from Sah\u00e1r\u00e1npur led by Mr. Grindall, the Magistrate. Biji Singh fell in the defence with a large number of his followers, and the villages of Taluka\nKunja were settled with the resident proprietary bodies. Taluka Dadli, held by Gulab Singh, consisted of thirty-two villages and two hamlets, and he entered into engagements for all except one village. The second settlement, from 1818-19 A.D., was made with Mohar Singh, son of Gulab Singh, but he failed to meet his engagements, and a village settlement was made with the resident cultivating communities in 1819-20 A.D. (1227 fasil).\n\nTaluka Talheri was held by Rani Daya Kunwar, the widow of Bakht Singh, and consisted of 24 villages and three hamlets, for all of which she engaged at an annually progressive revenue which in 1225 fasil amounted to Rs. 16,941. At the second settlement in the following year, the demand was reduced to Rs. 15,000. In 1822 the occupant zamindars of 17 out of the 24 villages complained to Mr. Ross of the exactions of a farmer to whom the Rani had made over the entire taluka, being herself unable to manage it. Mr. Ross cancelled the engagements, and admitted the zamindars to settlement. Talheri khas, the residence of the Rani, was settled with her in full proprietary right, and an allowance of five per cent. on the revenue of the remaining villages was allowed to her, pending the decision of her claim to the proprietary right. This state of things continued until her death, when the allowance ceased. Taluka Jataul was held by Kura Singh, and consisted of 49 villages and 13 hamlets, which, owing to the refusal of Kura Singh to accept the terms offered, were settled with the village zamindars. Taluka Chaundaheri consisted of 42 villages and two hamlets, held by Basawan Singh, who also refused to engage for the revenue assessed. A similar course was adopted in his case. Thus the great Gujar estate was broken up.\n\n---\n\n1 The following table summarises the history of the whole mudarari, consisting in 1813-14 of 827 villages and 86 hamlets:\n\n| Name of taluka | With whom settled in 1813-14 | When settled with the village proprietors | Number of Villages | Hamlets |\n|----------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------|--------|\n|                | Village proprietors           | 1813-14                                  | 322               | 5      |\n| Thitki         | Rani Dhan Kunwar and Khushal Slogh | 1821                                      | 289+11            | 11     |\n| Jabbarheri     | Badan Singh                   | 11 villages in 1813-14, remainder in 1836 | 49+1              |        |\n| Baledh         | Rani Sada Kunwar              | 4 villages in 1813-14, 30 ditto in 1818-02 | 34                |        |\n| Kunja          | Kora Singh                    | 1831                                     | 44                |        |\n| Dadli          | Gulab Singh                   | 1819-20                                  | 89                | 2      |\n| Talheri        | Daya Kunwar                   | 1822                                     | 24                | 3      |\n| Jataul         | Kura Singh                    | 1813-14                                  | 49                | 35     |\n| Chaundaheri    | Basawan Singh                 | 1813-14                                  | 42                | 2      |\n\nTotal: 827 Villages, 36 Hamlets\nFortunately for the owner of Landhaura khas, he came into possession as a minor, and his estates fell under the administration of the Court of Wards. Arrangements were made in 1853 for the household expenses of the minor Raja Raghubir Singh and his mother, and the management of the estates in their respective districts was vested in the Collectors of Saharanpur and Meerut. In 1854 these comprised 38 villages or portions of villages, yielding in the Saharanpur District a revenue of Rs. 26,000 a year. Subsequently the Raja received eleven villages in reward for good conduct during the mutiny and two by purchase. Before the mutiny his profits amounted to Rs. 4,992 besides six villages held in direct management. In 1863 the profits rose to Rs. 7,748 on the villages which were sublet, besides 16 villages paying Rs. 7,872 held under direct management.\n\nRaghubir Singh died in 1868, some say from poison, and his widow has adopted one Nathu Singh, a relative of her husband's mother. By this adoption the headship of the Gujar clan has passed away from the Khubar got, and has, therefore, been the cause of much irritation amongst the members of the family. This year (1874), a person claiming to be Raghubir Singh appeared at Naini Tal, and demanded to be recognized and put in possession of the Landhaura estates. His history runs that he was half-poisoned and half-burned, and was then thrown into the Ganges river, whence he was rescued by a mendicant, with whom he has remained from 1868 until now.\n\nOn the 2nd of October, 1803, immediately after the capture of Aligarh, the Governor-General appointed the Collectors of the border districts to take charge of the country conquered from Sindhis, and provide for its administration, subject to the orders of the Commander-in-Chief. They were further directed to divide the districts into three divisions, to be attached to Etawa, Muradabad and Fatehgarh, respectively. The Commissioners met at Koil on the 28th October, 1803, and proposed the distribution of the conquered territory into four divisions. The first portion comprised the present districts of Saharanpur, Muzaffarnagar and a part of Meerut, altogether fifty-three mahals or parganahs. The second portion included Khurja, Sikandarabad, Bulandshahr, Shikarpur, Daudri, Dausa, Kansa, Dankaur, Ghaziuddin-nagar (Ghaziabad), Begumabad, Malakpur, Garhmuktesar, and some other neighbouring parganahs, altogether thirty in number. The third portion, to be attached to the Fatehgarh District, contained Koil, Kanka, Atrauli, Dibhai, Chhara, Bamanri, Pindraval, Khair, Nob, Chandauli, Barauli, Muthal, and Pitampur, altogether twelve mahals. The fourth portion, to be attached to Etawa, contained fifteen mahals,\u2014Firuzabad, Sahpu, Sadabad, Kandauli, Raya, Jiwar, Mursan, Mat, Mahaban, Hasangarh, Gorai, Husain, Tuksan, Hathras, Jalesar, Khalilganj, Sonai, Moheriya and Daryapur. The Commander-in-Chief, on the 4th November of the same\nyear, gave orders that the first division or district of Saharanpur should be divided into two portions, the northern and southern, and that the latter should be placed under the Collector of Moradabad, Mr. Leycester, whilst the northern portion of the district remained under Delhi. The settlement of the second division was entrusted to Colonel Ochterlony, the Resident at Delhi. The third division was entrusted to Mr. Claude Russell, the Governor-General's Agent at Fatehgarh; and the fourth was placed under Mr. R. Cunningham, the Collector of Etawa.\n\nIn August, 1804, Aligarh was formed by the union of the second, third and fourth divisions, with the addition of parganahs Sikandra Rao from Etawa, and Antepahar from Muradabad. The subsequent fiscal history of these divisions will be found under the Aligarh District. The northern division of Saharanpur was placed under charge of Mr. J. D. Guthrie, and instructions were issued to all the new Collectors to make a settlement for one year with the actual proprietors or amils of respectability, or, if it should be found necessary, the collections might be entrusted to tahsildars. All large estates were to be settled by the Collector in person, and, where possible, security should be taken for the due payment of the revenue. All arrears due to the Marhattas were to be remitted, and a separation was to be effected between the land revenue proper and the miscellaneous duties and taxes, such as bazar and transit duties, that had been imposed by previous rulers. The Collectors were further instructed that \"while fixing a fair and equitable rate, they should remember to impress upon the people the inestimable advantages of the British rule, and conciliate their attachment and confidence.\" The monopoly of the sale of salt was broken up, and a system of duties on the import of western salt, and the manufacture of salt within British territory, was substituted for it. The year 1804-5 was marked by the raids of the Marhattas and Amir Khan, and military rather than fiscal affairs demanded the entire attention of the District Officers. In November, 1804, a Judge-Magistrate was appointed to both Saharanpur and Meerut, and their jurisdiction was defined. Both divisions, however, still remained under one Collector, who resided at Meerut, and formed the settlement of both divisions of the district, with the aid of two Assistants. In October, 1804, the Commander-in-Chief issued instructions for the settlement for 1804-5 (1212 faali). He directed the Collector to cause the Amirs to examine the rent-rolls of each village for the years 1801-2 and 1802-3, and in all possible cases to take engagements from the actual proprietors at an easy revenue. Possession was to be upheld, and in a taluka, if the subordinate proprietors could be discovered, they were\n\n---\n\n1 The line separating the two divisions ran through the middle of the present district of Musaffarnagar. 2 Apparently here a kind of farmer. 3 27th November, 1804, Board.\nto be admitted to engagements. All cesses were abolished, and the revenue was assessed on the produce of the land only. Regulation VIII. of 1793 was quoted for the guidance of the Collector, who was further directed to appoint tahsildars, who were to receive 11\u00bd per cent. on the collections, and be responsible for the police of their respective charges. They were to give security equal to the largest instalment they had to collect, and were to be assisted by the kanungoes.\n\nThough it was evidently the wish of Government to make engagements with the actual proprietors of the land, yet it was found impossible suddenly to break up the great estates held on fixed rates, which in this district quite equalled 1805-6 to 1807-8, in area the lands held under a temporary settlement.\n\n1213 to 1215 jadai. Raja Ramdayal Singh of Landhaura, Raja Nain Singh, Rao Ramdhan Singh, Rao Ajit Singh, Zulfakar Ali Khan and Bahrmand Khan were all confirmed in their holdings, and the first triennial settlement under Regulation IX. of 1805 was made with them, at the same rates (1805-6 to 1807-8).\u00b9 This farming system had been the practice under the Marhatta Government, and even in the temporarily settled portion under the British Government, a system known as the amdi was in force, by which the amils or amils received ten per cent. on the collections made by them. In the latter case, the standard observed was a certain undefined proportion of the crops, which was collected either in kind or in cash, according to the market rates current in the neighbourhood. The amount of this proportion depended on the will or ability of the amil. The natural consequence of this state of affairs was, that agriculture had been gradually on the decline in the district during the latter years of the Marhatta rule, the revenues had shown a corresponding decrease, and the people were sunk in indigence and despondency. Since the annexation of the district, the repeated incursions of the Sikhs, Marhattas and Pin-dars had still further caused great loss to the people, so that at the commencement of the first triennial settlement, the Collector had much to encounter before he could show any improvement in the revenue.\n\nWriting in 1807, Mr. Guthrie, however, notices a gradual improvement in the state of cultivation, and remarks, that whilst formerly 12 to 15,000 bullocks were carried out of the district annually to carry grain for the armies in the field at Rs. 2-13 per month, a rate then considered profitable, the charge in 1805 had risen to Rs. 3-8, and in 1807, not only were these bullocks employed within the district, but there was a considerable importation of cattle from the trans-Jumna districts. The Banjara bullock-owners, too, had taken to settled habits, and were then engaged in pasturage or cultivation in the waste tracts along the\n\n\u00b9 Board's Rec., October 1, 1804; September 30, 1805. The full history of each of these talukas will be found under the head of \"old families\" in the district notices.\nJumna and under the hills. The land-revenue of 1211 fa\u1e63\u1e6d\u012b (1803-4) stood at Rs. 12,69,820; this rose in 1212 fa\u1e63\u1e6d\u012b to Rs. 13,16,237; in 1213 there was an increase of Rs. 44,506; in 1214 of Rs. 48,109; and in 1215 of Rs. 80,191; giving an actual increase in 1215 fa\u1e63\u1e6d\u012b (1807-8) of Rs. 2,08,444, or, if the revenue from lapsed revenue-free lands (Rs. 10,781) be added, of Rs. 2,19,225 over the initial settlement of 1803-4 A.D. The improvement was further shown in the cultivation of the more valuable kinds of produce, such as sugar-cane and wheat.\n\nTo illustrate his remarks, Mr. Guthrie prepared an estimate\u00b9 for the year 1806-7 \u201cin three parganahs selected for the purpose, as estimate in 1807.\u201d Having ascertained the quantity of each article of produce, and fixed its price according to the average rate of the market for that year, he calculated the proportion the value bore to the assessment, and then, according to the average produce of the lands, computed the extent of cultivation (for each article) necessary to yield a quantity equal to the proportion its value bears to the assessment. The rate at which the assessment was calculated was in general one-half of the produce, or eight annas on the rupee, payable to Government, the other moiety being the proprietor\u2019s share. In several places, however, the proprietor\u2019s share, according to established local custom, exceeded one-half of the produce; and the average rate of the assessment upon the different articles of produce would perhaps have been more accurately estimated at the proportions of seven annas on the rupee as the Government share, and nine annas as the share for proprietors. The year was a favourable one, followed by a year of scarcity from drought.\n\nEstimate for the year 1214 fa\u1e63\u1e6d\u012b of the produce of the lands in the Saharanpur District paying revenues to Government, showing the extent of the cultivation and of the produce of the different articles, and the proportion which the value of each article respectively is supposed to bear to the assessment.\n\n| Articles       | Produce of one acre in maunds. | No. of acres in cultivation. | Total produce at the average rate of one acre. | Value according to the average rate of the market in 1214 fa\u1e63\u1e6d\u012b. |\n|----------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| Sugar          | 21 19 11                        | 12,695                       | 266,500                                       | 6,01,875                                         |\n| Uncleaned cotton | 0 35 1                          | 17,137                       | 15,047                                        | 1,90,313                                         |\n| Toriya        | 1 8 0                           | 21,638                       | 31,348                                        | 25,078                                           |\n| Carrots       |                                 | 19,041                       |                                               | 16,719                                           |\n| Manduwa       | 3 20 7                          | 13,888                       | 47,022                                        | 25,078                                           |\n| Manduwi       | 3 20 7                          | 13,888                       | 47,022                                        | 25,078                                           |\n\n\u00b9 The figures in the original are in bighas, and these I have changed into acres for the sake of uniformity; see Sel.

gives the opinion of a more than ordinary intelligent observer as to the general state of cultivation at this early period of British rule, and affords material for comparison with the later statistics of the three districts it refers to as to the amount of produce per acre before the introduction of the canal system. This question is noticed under each district separately, but I would here once again warn the reader that, as far as I can see, we have not, as yet, statistics as to the productive powers of the land of such scientific accuracy as would warrant any but the most general conclusions to be drawn from them. Throughout these volumes I give only the estimates that bear on their face an appearance of some care in their preparation, and carry with them the sanction of a name of established reputation. It would be beyond the scope of this work to add any remarks of my own, or draw those general conclusions which might safely be made even from the imperfect data we possess; these I leave for a second edition, when, perhaps, more carefully prepared statistics, and\na more extended experience, may enable me to educe the sound principles which must underlie the present heterogeneous mass of agricultural statistics.\n\nContinuing Mr. Guthrie's description of the general state of the district, he states his opinion that in point of cultivation, whilst superior to the lands adjoining Bareilly and Muradabad, Saharanpur was inferior to the Dab districts adjoining it on the south. Towards the Ganges, the lands comprised in the great mukarars were flourishing, which Mr. Guthrie says \"evidently shows the happy effects of giving to the occupiers all the power over, and interest in the soil which is necessary for improvements;\" but which may be more correctly attributed to the fact that the holders of these estates were too powerful to be trifled with, and were able, by their local position, their numerous forts and their clan influence, to defy or buy off the Sikh invaders, and compel their Marhatta rulers to accept a moderate revenue. Further westward, towards the centre of the district, the lands showed less improvement, and near the banks of the Jumna the waste land bore an excessive proportion to the cultivated area. Villages were few, and the owners were sunk in indigence, not because the land was less productive, but entirely owing to this tract being constantly exposed to the depredations of the Sikhs. These raiders \"not only exacted from every land-holder a tribute, denominated raki, the amount of which was proportioned to his means, but on many occasions reduced the zamindars to total ruin by burning their villages and driving off their cattle.\" The appearance of the villages showed the state of general insecurity; almost every one was surrounded by a wall or ditch, or both, as a means of defence against invasion.\n\nExclusive of Begam Sumri's jdgir, the district was estimated to contain about 5,900 square miles, or 6,289,400 local bighas, which Mr. Guthrie distributes as follows:\n\n| Cultivated | Uncultivated |\n|------------|--------------|\n| Rs.        | Rs.          |\n| Lands held in mukarari, or on a fixed assessment | 736,000 | 387,000 |\n| Ditto under a temporary assessment | 924,000 | 887,000 |\n| Ditto free of revenue | 617,000 | 474,000 |\n| Rivers, hills, roads, waste, &c. | 2,314,000 |\n| Total | 2,277,000 | 3,012,000 |\n\n---\n\n1 The great errors at present made are, first and greatest, the entire absence of any explanation as to the mode in which the statements were prepared,\u2014whether allowance was made for the rainfall, the presence or absence of canal irrigation, the nearness of markets, the pressure of assessment, the means of communication, the existence of scarcity elsewhere which had an influence on the price of grain, the character of the cultivators and their landlords, the spring-level of the well water, and other similar matters which affect the amount and value of the produce.\n\n2 The term applied to estates held on a fixed revenue, such as those of Rajas Ramdayal and Nain Singh.\n\n3 Giving 1,066 bighas to the square mile, or 1,665 bighas to an acre; see further, Sel. Rev. Rec., N.W. P., 1818-20, p. 48; Ibid., 1821-27, p. 300.\nAt the same time, by a rough census, the population was estimated at 703,575, or 119\u00b725 persons to the square mile. Except in the case of revenue-free lands, the amount of cultivation was computed on the spot village by village by actual measurement or estimate, and in revenue-free villages the total is based on the estimate of the k\u00e1n\u00fango. \"In every instance where the zamind\u00e1r offered objections to enter into engagements for the payment of what was considered a fair and equitable assessment, the amount produced was ascertained by the actual measurement of the crops on the ground, and the extent of the land cultivated.\" In no case was the settlement in these estates made with a farmer, except where the actual proprietor refused to engage. Excluding the mukarars of R\u00e1mday\u00e1l and Nain Singh, there were no considerable renters in the district, the farms being generally extremely sub-divided, yielding on an average about Rs. 800 a year. Mr. Guthrie's great difficulty in carrying out the orders of Government in this respect was the depressed state of the smaller proprietary bodies, who, from want of stock to perform the business of cultivation, and from want of confidence in the permanency of the new rule, frequently \"resigned the probable advantages to be gained by managing their own lands for the certainty of sharing a stipulated part of the produce.\"\n\nThe story of Captain Shaikh Kalan is worth reproduction, as giving what even in 1828 was considered an illustration of the evil \"effects produced by summary settlements for the land-revenue of large tracts of country with an intermediate agent, whether designated as zamind\u00e1r, talukad\u00e1r, or revenue-farmer,\" and which contributed in a small degree to the downfall of the talukad\u00e1ri system. Kalan belonged to an old Shaikh family in R\u00e1j\u00fapur, and early sought employment in the military service of the Marhattas. At the conquest in 1803 he joined the irregular corps formed by the British, and retired with the rank of Captain in 1810. In 1817-18, when the Collector had some difficulty in arranging for the villages of R\u00e1mday\u00e1l's mukarari that had then lapsed, Kalan stepped forward and offered to take as many as he could get in farm. He obtained possession of 149 villages, of which 47 were farmed to him with the consent of the proprietary body, 34 were given to him on account of the proprietors not attending to engage, 55, in consequence of a refusal to engage, and in 13 he had acquired the proprietary right by purchase. His mode of management is thus described by Mr. Reade, who was sent to investigate the affairs of this farm:\u2014\"It was customary with this farmer to under-farm the villages to the inhabitants, and on each village, in proportion to its size, he raised his under-farming assessment from Rs. 200 to Rs. 600 or Rs. 700 above the Government revenue. At the end of each year, after the accounts had been closed, he made the defaulters execute bonds for the sums due to him on their engagements.\" Bonds were also taken by the farmer for balances of advances made for carrying on the cultivation.\nThe result of all this was, that the people were thoroughly discontented; and when Mr. Ross came on deputation from the Board of Revenue into this district in 1822, they poured out their complaints before him. Mr. Ross made inquiries, and found that the conduct of Kalan in the management of his estate was both arbitrary and oppressive, and that the lease had never been confirmed by Government. He recommended that the lease should be cancelled, and a settlement be made with the village communities. This was done, and gave rise to Kalan's claim to over 1\u00bd lakhs of rupees as damages, which was subsequently adjusted by an offer of Rs. 15,000 on the part of Government. His sons, Z\u00e1min Ali Kh\u00e1n and Nij\u00e1b\u00fat Ali Kh\u00e1n, followed in the footsteps of their father, and engaged in the sometimes profitable business of buying up speculative parcels of land, and rights and interests in land of private individuals, at the sales by auction which so frequently took place in the earlier days of our rule. By a skilful management of the Civil Courts, they were able to obtain in Roorkee, for a trifling debt against three individuals, the lands owned by seventy-two persons in actual possession of their shares (see ROORKEE.). This was, no doubt, in a great measure due to the imperfect state of the record-of-rights; but it speaks badly for our administration that, though the wrong done was discovered, the only remedy that could be found was to apply to the same Court that wrought the injury by way of appeal against its own judgment.\n\nThe second triennial settlement was also under Regulation IX. of 1805, from 1216 to 1218 fa\u0161li (1808-9 to 1810-11 A.D.), and the assessment was to be framed upon the difference between the actual amount of the previous assessment for 1808-9 to 1810-11. Section V. of the same Regulation further provided that at the expiration of the year 1218 fa\u0161li a new settlement should be concluded with the same persons (if willing to engage) for a further period of four years, viz., 1219 to 1222 (1811-12 to 1814-15), at a fixed equal annual revenue formed by adding to the annual revenue of the second triennial settlement three-fourths of the net increase of revenue found to have accrued during any one year of that period. The second triennial settlement of this district was formed by Mr. H. Dumbleton, and gave a land revenue for 1218 fa\u0161li (1810-11 A.D.) of Rs. 18,93,743, exclusive of the great mukarats, or Rs. 4,78,632 in excess of the last year of the first triennial settlement. The drought of 1807-8, already noticed, produced serious embarrassments, so that the landholders were unable at once to accede to the terms pro-\n\n---\n\n1 It is unnecessary to notice the permanent settlement promised by section 7 of Regulation IX. of 1805 and Regulation X. of 1807, as the controversy on this subject continued to our own days would fill a volume by itself.\nposed, and reductions were allowed, amounting to Rs. 82,791 in the first year, and Rs. 19,480 in the last year of this settlement. The Commissioners, who then stood in the position of the Board of Revenue, noted the large proportion of estates in many parganahs either still altogether waste or only partially brought into cultivation, and recommended the exclusion of the northern division of the Saharanpur District, comprising the present district of that name and a great part of Muzaffarnagar, from the benefits of a permanent settlement on this account, as well as because of the improvement in agriculture contemplated from the reopening of the canal. It was also found that, notwithstanding the anxiety of the Revenue Officers to admit the proprietors to form engagements, a very extensive recourse to farming still appeared to be necessary. The following table shows the demand, receipts and balances, from 1803-4 to 1813-14 in rupees as finally adjusted in the Provincial accounts:\n\n| Year | Demand | Receipts | Balance | Charges of collection |\n|------|--------|----------|---------|----------------------|\n|      | Rs.    | Rs.      | Rs.     | Rs.                  |\n| 1803-4 | 18,718 | 12,491   | 29,639  | 1,41,787             |\n| 1804-5 | 18,119 | 12,182   | 28,665  | 2,05,958             |\n| 1805-6 | 15,004 | 14,966   | 3,813   | 2,27,976             |\n| 1806-7 | 16,063 | 16,050   | 1,816   | 9,68,617             |\n| 1807-8 | 16,796 | 16,788   | 978     | 2,30,217             |\n| 1808-9 | 18,834 | 18,807   | 2,445   | 1,56,973             |\n\nThe balances on the whole were very small when compared with Aligarh and Agra, showing that the assessment could not have pressed heavily on the people, whilst the revenue had more than doubled.\n\nThe next settlement was for four years, and was made under section V. of the Quinquennial settlement Regulation IX. of 1805, as already noticed. The total for 1811-12 to 1914-5 A.D., land-revenue from all sources for 1218 fasli, or 1810-11 A.D., amounted to Rs. 21,43,373. The new settlement showed a progressive enhancement; that for the first year, or 1219 fasli, amounted to Rs. 21,56,026; for 1220 fasli, to Rs. 21,75,176; for 1221 fasli, to Rs. 25,79,813, and for 1222 fasli, to Rs. 26,73,904. In 1813-14 the great mukarari of Raja Ramdayal Singh lapsed by his death. From the occupation of the British in 1803 to the death of the Raja, the assessment amounted only to Rs. 1,11,597. At the first\n\n---\n\n1 Sel. Rec., N.W.P., 1818-20, p. 370.\n2 By 1818-14 the greater number of the talukas combined in the old mukararis were broken up, and settlements were made with the village proprietors, whilst the villages themselves were incorporated with the other villages of the parganah in which they were situated, on a common list; so that from this time the names even of the old talukas disappear from the public records, and their boundaries can no longer be traced with any approach to accuracy.\nsummary settlement for five years the revenue was more than quadrupled, and showed as follows:\n\n|       | 1813-14 | 1814-15 | 1815-16 | 1816-17 | 1817-18 |\n|-------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Rs.   | 4,91,395 | 5,53,715 | 5,76,446 | 4,78,552 | 5,79,317 |\n\nAbatements were made in two of the estates, leaving the revenue at the close of the fifth settlement at Rs. 5,59,561. The next settlement of these estates was made for seven years, from 1818-19 to 1824-25.\n\nThe district settlement was for five years, from 1223 fa\u0161li to 1227 fa\u0161li (1815-16 to 1819-20 A.D.), and was made under Regulation X. of 1812. This settlement was extended for a second period of five years, or from 1228 to 1232 fa\u0161li (1820-21 to 1824-25 A.D.), by orders of Government in 1818. It was during the currency of these settlements that Meerut and Muzaffarnagar were formed into separate charges. The Sikandarabad, Tilbegampur, Ada, Dankaur, K\u00e1sna, Baran, M\u00e1lagarh and \u00c1h\u00e1r Malikpur parganahs were taken from the Aligarh district and added to the southern parganahs of the Sah\u00e1ranpur district to form the district of Meerut, whilst the midland parganahs of Sah\u00e1ranpur were placed under a Joint Magistrate and Deputy Collector resident at Muzaffarnagar. The subsequent history of these divisions will be found under their respective districts. In the meantime Regulation VII. of 1822 had been passed. The English copy was distributed in November, 1822, but the Persian copy was not ready until April, 1824, and in June of the same year the Governor-General in Council passed a resolution postponing the introduction of the procedure prescribed by the Regulation, as it was judged inexpedient to attempt to carry out its provisions in the short time that would elapse before the expiry of the second quinquennial settlement. It was therefore ordered that a third settlement for five years, from 1233 to 1237 fa\u0161li (1825-6 to 1829-30 A.D.), should be made at existing rates, until such time as the revision contemplated was completed.\n\nMr. Chamberlain, who had been deputed to assess the lapsed mukarari of Raja R\u00e1mday\u00e1l, was again sent to make the fourth settlement, or first quinquennial settlement of the whole of the parganahs now forming the district. He appears to have ascertained the actual out-turn of each estate, including even profits derived from the cultivation of small revenue-free patches; and taking this as his basis, he merely deducted the percentage allowed by the Regulations. Shortly after concluding the settlement, Mr. Chamberlain died, and was succeeded by Mr. Calvert. The assessment was soon found to be much greater than the people could pay, and the Board of Commissioners directed Mr. Calvert\nto make such remissions as he thought to be necessary. In 1817, Government relinquished in many cases the progressive increase that had been imposed by Mr. Chamberlain. The assessment, however, still remained far too high, and the partial revisions that subsequently took place led to further reductions, so that the revenue of the last year was considerably lower than that of the first year of the new assessment. Similar revisions took place during the second and third quinquennial settlements, with the same results.\n\nThe settlement under Regulation VII. of 1822 and IX. of 1833 of parganah Manglaur was made by Mr. Plowden in 1835; that of parganahs Deoband and R\u00e1mpur in 1834, by Messrs. Louis and Turner; that of parganahs Jaw\u00e1lapur, Jaur\u00e1si and R\u00farki, and tappas Kheri and Sakrauda by Mr. Grant in 1835; and that of the remainder of the district, and the revision of the whole of his predecessors' work, by Mr. E. Thornton during the years 1836-38. The proceedings were concluded and the records completed by Mr. M. P. Edgworth in 1841.\u00b9\n\nThe district then comprised twenty-one parganahs, two tappas (Kheri and Sakrauda), and two talukas. These sub-divisions were revised in 1841, and the number of parganahs was reduced to fifteen, in which the talukas and tappas were also absorbed. The measurements for the new settlement were commenced in 1833, and were finished in June, 1836, but were materially incorrect. Much land fit for, but not under cultivation, was entered as cultivated, and no uniform system for describing the soils and the land to be recorded as irrigated was adopted. The consequence is, that the statistics relating to both these subjects at this settlement are too untrustworthy for publication. The preceding assessments being found too high, Mr. Thornton proceeded to examine the fiscal history of each estate, and the rates of the different assessments, thus distinguishing those that were found capable of realization from those that were found insupportable. The principal causes of increase were the revenue from resumed revenue-free estates, which in 1838-39 was estimated at Rs. 1,25,000, and the re-settlement of the lapsed talukas of R\u00e1mday\u00e1l's mukarari.\n\nIt was Mr. Thornton who took up the settlement of the villages comprised in the mukarari estate, and ascertained whether the village communities or the heirs of R\u00e1mday\u00e1l were to be considered proprietors. He found that the proprietary right throughout the district almost universally rested in the resident cultivating communities. He found the villages of the mukarari were intermingled with others in the district, so that out of a circle including forty or fifty villages, some would be of either kind; and where not included in the mukarari, the cultivating community were acknowledged by all to be proprietors. The Rajp\u00fat or G\u00fcjar inhabitants of\n\n\u00b9 The proceedings of Mr. Thornton were sanctioned by G. O. 592, dated April 27th, 1844, and of Mr. Edgworth by G. O. 593, dated December 19th, 1843.\nthe whole circle, however, traced their origin to a common ancestor, the head of the common colony, so that the location of the settlements in both cases must have been about the same time, and due to the same cause. If in one case the community were to be considered proprietors, they must be equally regarded as such in the other case, for the only other source of proprietary right, viz., transfer by sale or otherwise, was not pleaded; and in fact the heirs of the late Raja did not claim for themselves the proprietary right, or to be admitted to settlement, except for such villages as they were themselves in occupancy of as proprietors. This delay in the recognition of the rights of the real proprietors for a period of twenty years was very prejudicial, not only to them, but to the safety of the general revenue. Though they had been under engagements for the revenue, they were unable to transfer their land or borrow money on the security of it. Mr. Thornton writes on this subject, that \"the refusal on the part of the revenue authorities to recognize the right has thus, owing to the view the people and the Court have taken of it, put in abeyance the right itself. Really distressing results from this have not unfrequently come under my notice, and I consider that much loss of revenue has ensued, particularly in the parganahs of the Jaw\u00e9l\u00e1pur tahsild\u00e1ri, where, the climate being insalubrious, the people require every inducement to connect them with the soil; and the suspension of their right in it, while it has prevented them from attaining prosperity, has offered a remarkable temptation to bad faith, for as the 'Kh\u00e1na Kh\u00e1l\u00ed' villages were never sold for balances, these people might make any terms with Government by a temporary abandonment of their villages, though in balances occasionally. However these desertions were met by the tahsild\u00e1r locating new persons in the abandoned villages, and thus has arisen another evil,\u2014the absolute loss of the suspended right, for a community, when dispersed for some years, cannot be re-united at the will of a Settlement Officer, nor be traced; and in the absence of all latter claimants, I have had, in some cases, to record, as in proprietary possession, persons of very recent occupation.\"\n\nThe record-of-rights was drawn up for the first time at this settlement, and the smallest sub-division of the land in each village was entered, with the name of the manager and the amount of land-revenue due from it. Arrangements were made for the appointment of patw\u00e1ris or village accountants, chauki-d\u00e1rs or village watchmen, and the selection of lambard\u00e1rs or the representatives of the village communities in their engagements with Government.\n\nFor the year 1260 fa\u0161l (1852-53 A.D.), the demand amounted to Rs. 10,04,567, giving a net increase on the previous actual receipts of Rs. 13,587. In 1859-60, previous to Mr. VansAgnew's assessment, the land-revenue amounted to Rs. 10,93,946. Mr. VansAgnew assessed the district at Rs. 11,29,442; this settlement, however,\n\n---\n\n1 Set. Rep., L, 150.\nwas not sanctioned, and orders were issued for its revision. These were carried out by the late Mr. H. D. Robertson, and the late Mr. H. LePoer Wynne, whilst the final report was drawn up in 1870 by Mr. H. B. Webster. Their assessment amounted to Rs. 11,38,580, or with cesses, and exclusive of jungle grants, which were separately assessed, to Rs. 12,47,951, and including these, to Rs. 12,97,313.\n\nThe orders of Government on the settlement were not issued until April, 1874, or twenty years after the first steps towards the assessment had been taken in hand. In 1854, Mr. Ross commenced the measurements, which were almost completed under the superintendence of Mr. Spankie when the mutiny broke out. They were continued again at the close of 1857, and completed by April, 1858. Early in 1859, Mr. VansAgnew commenced the assessment of the district, and completed it in 1863. He found the measurements fairly correct, and in the whole district only 107 villages had to be re-measured in this and the succeeding operations. The record-of-rights had, however, to be completely remodelled, as well owing to the natural changes caused by lapse of time, as to the effects of the rebellion of 1857-58, and the no less serious disturbances of proprietary right caused by the great famine of 1860-61. Mr. VansAgnew's mode of assessment, whilst satisfying himself, and, as subsequent inquiries showed, resulting in a tolerably fair apportionment of the State demand, was not recorded in writing, and afforded no materials by which the Government could judge of the expediency of confirming his arrangements.\n\nAs Saharanpur was the first of the old settlements to fall in, great care was taken in drawing up a series of rules for the guidance of the officers employed in revising the assessments. These rules, known as the \"Saharanpur instructions,\" were framed by the late Mr. J. R. Colvin, then Lieutenant-Governor of these Provinces, and form the basis on which all subsequent instructions were drawn up. The main alterations made were\u2014firstly, the reduction of the standard by which the demand of Government was settled from two-thirds to one-half of the calculated assets; and secondly, the adoption of the Panjab system of plane table survey instead of the cumbrous and inaccurate chain survey previously in use.\n\nIn 1864, the instructions for a revision of the entire assessment were issued.\n\nMr. H. D. Robertson. The proceedings were to embrace an inquiry into the adequacy and moderation of the assessment in general, and the actual assessment of each village in detail; and were to include the correction of the vernacular records and completion of the English records on the recognized system. The revision of the assessment of the Saharanpur tahsil\n\n---\n\n1 Report, Allahabad, 1870. The discrepancies as to the total of the assessment and the total of the area in this report are simply irreconcilable, and the figures given above are those finally accepted by the Board of Revenue and by Government.\nwas accomplished by Mr. H. D. Robertson. His assessment was based upon soil rates. The soils were divided into *rausli*, *dakar*, *misan*, and *bhidia*, but subsequently *rausli* and *dakar*, comprising two-thirds of the entire area, were thrown together as one soil. These were again sub-divided into irrigated and unirrigated, and for each of the six classes a set of average rent-rates was drawn up. The rent-rates were based upon (1) cash rents, (2) rates framed on an estimate of the average value of the average produce of the crops, and (3) the village rent-rolls giving (where the rent was paid in kind) the value of the zamindar's share of the crops in a given year. Mr. Robertson depended chiefly upon the cash rates; but his accepted rates are often below the cash rates in *misan* and *bhidia* soils, and above them in *rausli-dakar*. These discrepancies are left unexplained. The general result, however, of his entire proceedings gave a land-revenue at assumed rates of Rs. 3,07,936, whilst that actually assessed amounted to Rs. 3,19,243, or with cesses, Rs. 3,51,136, or an increase in land-revenue over Mr. Thornton's assessment of Rs. 49,846. Of this sum, Rs. 19,505 are shown as due to canal irrigation over 28,071 acres.\n\nMr. Wynne revised the assessment of the Deoband, Rurki and Nakur tahsils, for which he submitted a rent-rate report previous to assessment. He at first divided the soils of each parganah into a number of circles, and calculated for each of these a series of six percentages relating to the proportion between the cultivated and irrigated areas, cultivated and culturable areas, manured and cultivated areas, sandy and cultivated areas, the number of the agricultural population, and the entire population to each one hundred acres. These elaborate calculations were, however, entirely disregarded in the actual assessment, which, like Mr. Robertson's final figures, was based upon the cash rates prevailing in each circle. \"Having fixed the average rate on all cultivated land in a circle, Mr. Wynne proceeded to select an average village as representative of the circle, and to graduate all other villages above or below this, according to their value. In doing this he must have been guided by the impressions received at the time of inspection, and have formed his own judgment as to the amount to be added to, or deducted from, the standard rate in each case. He then made an addition for old and new fallow (valuing them respectively at one-third and two-thirds of the rate on cultivation, after deducting 10 per cent. of the cultivated area for pasturage), and so worked out the assessment of the village. If he thought that assessment, or its rate of incidence, too high as compared with the other villages in the graduated list of the circle, he lowered it summarily, so as to agree with them.\" The rental estimated on this system amounted to Rs. 16,17,066, of which only Rs. 66,617 was assessed upon fallow land. The revenue, with cesses imposed, amounted to Rs. 8,99,783.\n\n---\n\n1 Government review of the Saharanpur settlement, p. 9.\nAs already noted, the rental of the last year of the expired settlement is said to have been Rs. 10,93,946, and that of the revised settlement to be Rs. 11,83,580, showing a total increase of Rs. 44,634. From the review of the settlement report, it would appear that Mr. Thornton's revenue-rate fell at Rs. 2-6-6 per acre on the cultivated area, and Mr. Vans Agnew's assessment at Rs. 1-9-6. The former was calculated at 75 per cent. of the assets, and the latter at 50 per cent. only. \"In 1866 the cultivated area of the district was 732,031 acres, the revenue Rs. 11,83,580, or Rs. 1-8-10 per acre; and the rental was Rs. 22,76,155, or Rs. 3-1-9 per acre. The increase in the rental was, therefore, Rs. 7,04,217; in the cultivated area, 76,190 acres; and in the rent-rate, Rs. 0-11-3, or 29 per cent. of the increase of rental. Of the rental increase, Rs. 2,36,904 (Rs. 76,190 \u00d7 Rs. 3-1-9) is due to enlarged cultivation, leaving Rs. 4,67,313 to be accounted for by other causes. The Settlement Officers attribute Rs. 79,369 of revenue, or Rs. 1,58,738 of rent, to canal irrigation, so that only Rs. 3,08,575, or a rise of Rs. 0-6-9 per acre, or 22\u00bd per cent., remains as due to the increased competition for land and the rise in prices,\u2014a rise which the Board of Revenue have shown to have been about 18 per cent. Thus, as is natural in a district where so much of the rent is paid in produce, the rent-roll advanced pari passu with the heightened price of the produce.\"\n\nMr. Thornton expressly stated in his report that the demand then fixed \"stopped far short of a fair demand,\" and wished that when a really good state of cultivation had been reached, a gradual approach should at each future revision be made to the sum fairly demandable.\" Mr. Bird, too, remarked that \"Saharanpur had been partially very much over-assessed, and that the measures employed for collecting the revenue had been equally harsh and illegal; some of the communities composed of the most industrious classes had been cruelly depressed. He looked to further equalization of the revenue on revision, and to an increase from extended cultivation.\" I cannot do better here than quote the Board's review on the settlement as a whole:\n\n\"Saharanpur, in truth, has not been happy in its fiscal history. The first 25 years of British rule were one long struggle on the one side at extracting large revenues, met by a resolute determination on the other to resist payment. The names of Messrs. Chamberlain and Moore are prominently connected with those early days. The efforts of the former to extract what he considered a proper revenue from Raja Ramdayal Singh's tenure ended in depopulating a large part of the district. Mr. Moore's assessments led to innumerable farms, and ultimately to an uprising of the Gujars at Kunja. Immense balances accrued, and the district, noted as one of the richest in the days of the Mughal, deteriorated rapidly. The settlement of 1838 did much to\n\n1 Letter 975, of 18th August, 1871, para. 35.\nrestore confidence, and to bring emigrants back. But all accounts agree that since the recent revision of settlement, by which the burden of land-revenue has been more equitably adjusted, and since the rapid extension of irrigation, the character of the hitherto unruly communities who inhabit the district is undergoing an extraordinary change, and the increase of prosperity is marked. The demand of the early settlements was, in fact, never collected. The settlement of 1888-58 worked, on the whole, fairly; but the district made little or no advance. Twenty-six per cent. of the district changed hands at very low rates. In many parts of the district, land could attract little or no capital. Population remained nearly stationary. Cultivation, however, had increased about nine per cent.; irrigation, too, had increased, but the exact amount cannot be ascertained, and prices had risen about 25 per cent. But neither extension of cultivation, nor irrigation, nor, so far as could be seen, any permanent rise in rents, justified the assumption of a larger increase in rental than 39 per cent. To have taken two-thirds of that rental would have enriched the Government revenue at the expense of the tardy progress of the district, and Saharanpur owes its present prosperity to the moderation shown in the revision of the demand. The demand fixed by the Settlement Officers was eventually accepted by all the proprietors, with the exception of one estate.\"\n\nThe demand in each tahsil for the year 1866-67, and from the year 1883-84 to the end of the settlement is distributed as follows (in rupees and omitting fractions of a rupee):\n\n| Class of estate | Saharanpur | Nakur | Bardi | Deoband | Total |\n|----------------|------------|-------|-------|---------|-------|\n| Revenue-paying | Rs. 3,45,000 | Rs. 5,074 | Rs. 2,86,154 | Rs. 2,88,700 | Rs. 2,72,645 | Rs. 2,75,657 | Rs. 3,81,350 | Rs. 3,33,930 | Rs. 12,35,164 | Rs. 12,47,637 |\n| Revenue-free\u2014  |            |       |       |         |       |       |       |       |       |       |\n| (a) For life cases | Rs. 2,617 | Rs. 2,617 | Rs. 150 | Rs. 150 | Rs. 1,000 | Rs. 1,000 | Rs. 736 | Rs. 736 | Rs. 4,661 | Rs. 4,661 |\n| (b) In perpetuity Go. | Rs. 234 | Rs. 234 | Rs. 1,346 | Rs. 1,346 | Rs. 23,644 | Rs. 23,644 | Rs. 12,120 | Rs. 12,120 | Rs. 3,068 | Rs. 3,068 |\n| Grant           | Rs. 13,400 | Rs. 14,625 |       |       |       |       |       |       | Rs. 36,021 | Rs. 41,625 |\n| Total           | Rs. 3,61,001 | Rs. 3,67,923 | Rs. 2,87,880 | Rs. 3,90,104 | Rs. 3,95,947 | Rs. 3,03,878 | Rs. 3,33,731 | Rs. 3,35,808 | Rs. 13,76,133 | Rs. 13,97,513 |\n\nThis assessment has been confirmed for thirty years, from July 1st, 1860, to June 30th, 1890.

Zam\u012bnd\u0101r\u012b tenures are those in which the whole land is held and managed in common, and the rents and whole profits of the estate are thrown into one common stock and divided amongst the several proprietors, whose rights are estimated according to fractional shares, whether of a rupee, or of the local unit of land measure known as a bigha. Pattid\u0101r\u012b tenures may be divided into perfect and imperfect pattid\u0101r\u012b or bh\u0101yach\u0101ra. Perfect pattid\u0101r\u012b is that tenure wherein the whole lands are held in severalty by the different proprietors, all of whom are jointly responsible for the Government revenue, though each is theoretically responsible only for the quota represented by the proportion of the land he holds to the whole estate. Imperfect pattid\u0101r\u012b is where portions of the land are held in severalty, and portions in common, with a joint responsibility for the Government demand. In this case the revenue is primarily made up from the rents of the common lands, and the remainder by a b\u0101chh, or cess, proportioned to the holdings in severalty, and calculated either by custom or on a fixed scale. Mr. Wynne writes that \u201cthe habits of proprietors and cultivators alike are simple. Both are ignorant of the extremes of poverty and riches. They all live from hand to mouth; get from the village Baniya an advance when they need it on account of a marriage or funeral, or a bad season, or fine from a Court of law, and repay it with interest, according to the extent of their credit, from 12 to 30 per cent.\u201d\nThe tract of waste jungle and forest land lying along the base of the Siw\u00e1lfk hills remained nominally in the occupation of the estates bordering on it, or anyone who chose to use it, until the settlement in 1838. Mr. Thornton then measured off the superfluous waste, and included it in the large tracts mapped as the Kheri, K\u00e1srao and Pathari N\u00e1di forests. In 1839 orders were issued by the Board of Revenue to lease these tracts to persons capable of bringing them under cultivation. In 1840 Mr. Edgeworth took engagements from various parties, but his settlement was not sanctioned, and subsequently, under the new grant rules, fresh arrangements were made by Messrs. Davidson, Craigie, and Ross, all of which were sanctioned by Government. The following statement shows the number and locality of the grants, the period for which they were settled, and the initial and full revenue demand, omitting fractions of a rupee.\n\n| Number and locality of grant | Period for which settled | Demand | Period for which settled | Demand |\n|-----------------------------|--------------------------|--------|--------------------------|--------|\n|                             | From | To   | Lowest | Highest | From | To   | Lowest | Highest |\n| 8 Pathari N\u00e1di              | 1838-39 | 1854-55 | 31 | 2,838 | 1 Kheri | 1846-47 | 1890-91 | 7 | 592 |\n| 1                           | 1841-43 | 1857-58 | 8 | 243 | 7 | 1847-48 | 1896-97 | 518 | 2,800 |\n| 2                           | 1842-43 | 1858-59 | 16 | 1,259 | 6 | 1850-51 | ... | 21 | 1,741 |\n| 2                           | 1843-44 | 1859-90 | 9 | 700 | 9 | 1879-80 | 4,953 | 7,940 |\n| 5 Do. & Kheri               | 1844-45 | 1850-51 | 8 | 4,646 | 5 | 1854-55 | 1904-05 | 16 | 1,141 |\n| 3 Pathari N\u00e1di              | 1845-46 | 1890-91 | 46 | 3,767 | 5 | 1858-59 | ... | 37 | 2,998 |\n| 1                           | 1891-92 | 3 | 175 | 4 | 1869-90 | 1890-91 | 40 | 3,143 |\n| 10                          | 1884-85 | 69 | 5,617 | 10 | ... | 1906-06 | 77 | 6,798 |\n| 1                           | 1890-91 | 28 | 2,306 | 1 | 1843-44 | 1889-90 | 27 | 2,942 |\n| 1 Kheri                     | 1844-45 | 1890-91 | 28 | 2,306 | 1 | 1844-45 | 1891-92 | 6 | 502 |\n| 6                           | 1845-46 | 1894-95 | 437 | 2,724 | ... | 1890-91 | 16 | 1,341 |\n|                             | Total 104 | ... | ... | ... | ... | 6,596 | 70,446 |\n\nAll of these grants, were in force in 1863 except six grants, which were resumed for nonfulfilment of the conditions on which they were granted. Three of them were subsequently settled,\u2014Nasirpur in the Pathari N\u00e1di forest and the two K\u00e1srao grants of L\u00e1lw\u00e1la and Muj\u00e1hidpur Satiw\u00e1la. In the beginning of 1863, the remainder of the unlet jungle grants were handed over to the Forest Department. Many of the grants were resumed\u00b9 in 1865, and others were included in the assessed area of the neighbouring parganahs, so that only 79 remained in 1870 on the grant register.\n\n\u00b9 See G. O. 4741, of June 4th, 1866; 1090A., of 30th September, 1872. 18,709\u2014111.\nThe cultivator with a right of occupancy appears to have been unknown in the district previous to the enactment of Act X. of 1859. Mr. Thornton in 1838 writes:\u2014\"The cultivators who are not zamindars are throughout the district, to speak generally, mere tenants-at-will.\" In portions of taluka Jabarheri and parganah Jawi lapur alone did Mr. Thornton find cultivators of this class, and these were the old zamindars who had dropped out of the fiscal management of their villages. Wherever rent-payers were found, they were invited to advance their claim to occupancy without the zamindar being able to eject them at will. The claim when advanced was merely to occupancy subject to the payment of a fair rent, and no right was urged to hold at low rates.\" Again, Mr. Wynne writes\u2014\"There is, as a rule, hardly any distinction between the rent-paying tenant and the revenue-paying proprietor. The former never claims the title of zamindar. He, as well as the mere cultivator, calls himself Sikkha-ka-ryat,\" the subject of the Government, and he knows the payment of the tenant (rent), and his own payment (revenue), both by the same name, \"baki\" (arrears); or, if he is choice in his mode of expression, \"muamla\" (a matter, the matter, par excellence, of importance in his life). The rent which the tenant pays is often no more than the allotment of the Government demand on his share, and especially in bhayachara communities it is often calculated at an advance of 25 per cent. (stedi), or 50 per cent. (deorhi) on that demand. It is true that this system of regulating rents by custom is gradually disappearing, and has already disappeared very extensively, but the traditional feeling in which it originated is still shown in the absence of a marked distinction between the proprietor and cultivator. There is still hardly anywhere any difference in the appearance, dress, houses or mode of living in general of the two classes. I do not mean to say that in all these respects the proprietors are not, as a whole, better off than the cultivators, but that it is difficult to pronounce from the circumstances of any particular man in these respects to which class he belongs. From the absence of social distinctions between the two classes, the happiest relations prevail, as a rule, between them. Suits under the rent law are very rarely brought into Court. Indeed, questions regarding rent can hardly arise in a community thus constituted. Nearly all the suits that have come under my cognizance have arisen in the few villages where the proprietary right is vested in a single powerful individual, or in the numerous cases in which the old proprietor has been bought out by a money-lender.\"\n\nSince Mr. Wynne wrote, however, the tide has set against the abnormal status of the non-proprietary cultivator; the zamindars have begun to exercise\n\n---\n\n1 Set.

Strange to say the J\u0101ts and G\u0101ras, who are really frugal and industrious, seem to be more in debt than the unthrifty Gujars and Rajputs. This is said to arise from two causes:\u2014firstly, they can get longer and more extensive credit from the money-lenders; and secondly, these men were for a long series of years singled out for the payment of more than the usual proportional share of the Government demand. Mr. R. Bird noticed this fact in his minute on the settlement. Mr. Thornton perceived it, too, and did as much as he could to equalize taxation. Mr. Vans Agnew and Mr. Wynne both proposed large reductions with the same object of giving industrious classes an opportunity to throw off the load of debt that oppresses them. The labouring population consists chiefly of Chamars. They are not in such a degraded condition as the men of the same class in the eastern districts of the Benares Division. Mr. Wynne writes:\n\n\"They (the labourers) are under a very modified kind of servitude to the proprietors of the particular village in which they reside. That is to say, in return for the protection received, and the skins of all the dead animals, they are bound to provide the families of the proprietor with two pairs of shoes a year, and are in all cases bound to meet any call for labour that may be made on the whole village. They were moreover bound to serve the landlord in the field for wages in grain; but of late, especially since the railway and canal works gave such an impetus to the demand for labour, they have begun to emancipate themselves from even this mark of servitude, and such is the call for labour, that I have met with instances of a high-caste proprietor, even a Rajput, associating a Cham\u00e1r in partnership with himself in his seer.\"\n\nThough the population is dense compared with other districts in these Provinces, it cannot be said that there is any pressure on the resources of the land. Every parganah has a large proportion of culturable waste, or land capable of much higher cultivation, sufficient to meet any normal increase in the population. Mr. Wynne, however, anticipates the possibility of an excessive increase in the canal-irrigated tracts, where the certainty of a return for labour has attracted a large population from without. He instances the villages along the Eastern Jumna Canal as presenting \"occasional instances of that simultaneous co-existence of poverty and wealth which is so happily wanting in the rest of the country. When this process is complete, the power of a canal-irrigated tract to supply, in case of drought, a surplus of grain for the famine-stricken districts will be much impaired. The mischief, such as it is, will, however, be considerably held in\n\n---\n\n1 Mr. Wynne enumerates amongst the checks to improvement the want of wells, not only for irrigation but even for drinking water, experienced in portions of Bhagwanpur, N\u0101gal, R\u016brki, Manglaur and Deoband, and the extreme size of many of the villages. His remarks will be found in the Settlement Report, p. 141.\ncheck by the steady rise in the canal water-rates, which I have always advocated\u2014raise your water-rent to the point at which, in point of cheapness, it barely competes with irrigation from wells, and you will at least delay the excessive influx of inhabitants from without.\u201d The town population present a painful contrast to the agricultural population. Sub-division of shares has been carried to the extreme, and every man, however small his share, disdains personal labour. Hence the degraded miserable state of the Musalm\u00e1n inhabitants of the decayed towns of Gangoh, Lakhna\u00fati and N\u00e1nauta.\n\nThe average holding of cultivators, as given by Mr. Robertson for the Sah\u00edranpur tahsil, shows the seer holding of proprietors as five acres, the average holding of cultivators with rights of occupancy as eight acres, and the holding of tenants-at-will as six acres. Mr. Wynne\u2019s figures for the remainder of the district in bighas, equivalent to 0\u00b75062 of an acre, are as follow:\n\n| Proprietary cultivators | Non-proprietary cultivators |\n|-------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| 1-5 bighas              | 6-8.                        |\n| 8-10.                   | 10-15.                      |\n| 15-30.                  | 30-40.                      |\n| 40-50.                  | 50-75.                      |\n| 75-100.                 | 100 upwards.                |\n\nIt will be seen that the majority of the holdings are under six acres. Mr. G. Williams has given me the following table showing Mr. VansAgnew\u2019s distribution of the cultivated area in 1862, and the estimates given by the tahsild\u00e1rs in 1872 (in acres).\u00b9\n\n| Class of cultivators | VansAgnew.

On the whole, he thinks the tahsild\u00e1rs\u2019 returns, except Nak\u00far, are as nearly accurate as can be hoped for.\nMr. Williams writes\u2014\"It is useless to attempt to draw inferences from figures which are palpably untrustworthy, for although the difference between the number of hereditary and non-hereditary cultivators in these statements is perhaps susceptible of explanation, none can be offered for the glaring discrepancy between the figures in the first line of the statement. It is incredible that the proprietary cultivators at present holding land in the Nakur tahsil alone outnumber those in the whole district ten years ago. The figures are accordingly given for what they are worth. Mr. VansAgnaw's calculations tend to show that the average holding is small, and seldom large enough to afford a decent subsistence to one family, for an ordinary cultivator finds it hard to extract a profit of more than Rs. 2 or Rs. 2-8 a month from five acres of land, or say about 30 bighas kuchcha. A proprietary cultivator would, of course, be better off with a farm of that size, but his condition could hardly equal that of a person receiving a salary of eight rupees a month, unless his lands were remarkably good. It will therefore be easily understood that the peasantry (with the exception of the sturdy Rajputs and G\u00fajars, who have always eked out a subsistence by cattle lifting, and must always continue to do so, so long as the present state of things lasts) are, as elsewhere, in a most miserable condition, being to all intents and purposes merely serfs of the petty money-lenders, who not only exact usurious interest, but also sell with light weights and short measures, and buy according to standards arranged on the opposite principle. Again, if a man borrow twenty rupees to day and pay the equivalent in grain, or otherwise, within 36 hours, inexorable custom compels him to give from six to twelve months' interest, all the same, at the rate usually charged. This practice has evidently been introduced with great ingenuity, for the purpose of discouraging debtors from getting out of debt when they have the means of doing so at hand. Gold or silver ornaments are considered the best security, and on such a pawn money can be borrowed at 12 or sometimes even 6 per cent., but if it be lent on a bond with land as the security, the interest rises to 18 and 24 per cent., and the peasant proprietor is fortunate if he can procure a loan at that rate, for 36 and 38 per cent. is often charged. The hypothetical classification of holdings is\u2014large holding, 150 to 200 bighas kuchcha (25 to 33 acres); middling, 80 to 100 kuchcha bighas. There are certainly not many middling holdings in the district, and still fewer large holdings.\"\n\nCertain tables were prepared in 1864-65 and 1865-66, to show the annual value and distribution of the agricultural produce of the district. These tables give the results of an examination of the returns framed by the patw\u00e1ris, and the results of the Settlement Officer's own investigations. Mr. Robertson, in making his estimates for the Saharanpur tahsil, divided each parganah into circles, for which he ascertained the quantity of the produce and the zamind\u00e1r's share from\nthe village papers (for the year 1864-65) of four or five representative villages in each circle. The returns were tested by comparing them with the private record (khasrah kanku) of the proprietors. The value of the produce was obtained from the village price-current, \"and this being divided by the number of bighas cultivated in each circle, gave the gross produce and the zamindar's share in each circle.\" Mr. Wynne also relied upon the proprietors' private papers for the average return of each crop, and with them corrected the village papers throughout the Sult\u00e1npur parganah. Taking these as his basis he graduated the other parganahs according to the relation which their productive qualities were known to bear to Sult\u00e1npur. Whilst Mr. Wynne's estimate of the value of the produce exceeds that made by the patw\u00e1ris in four out of eleven parganahs examined by him, Mr. Robertson's estimate is in excess throughout. These estimates, though imperfect, are as near an approach to the actual truth as we are likely to obtain. I accordingly give an abstract of them, referring to the original for details.\u00b9\n\n**Distribution of produce statistics for 1864-65.**\n\n| Detail of occupancy | Mr. Wynne's estimate for Deoband, Nakir and R\u00e1rki. | Mr. Robertson's estimate for Sah\u00e1r\u00e1npur Tahsil. |\n|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n|                    | Cultivated area in bighas. | Value of produce in rupees. | Zamindar's share in rupees. | Cultivated area in bighas. | Value of produce in rupees. | Zamindar's share in rupees. |\n| Cultivated by proprietors | 566,651 | 28,03,721 | 28,03,791 | 108,081 | 5,91,57 | 5,91,517 |\n| By tenants paying only their share of the revenue | ... | 85,139 | 1,91,995 | 34,910 | 6,342 | 34,077 | 6,189 |\n| By assignees of the land revenue | ... | 18,084 | 59,183 | ... | 8,882 | 49,354 | ... |\n| By cultivators paying in kind | ... | 214,898 | 9,47,368 | 3,13,761 | 173,907 | 8,97,010 | 2,91,696 |\n| By cultivators paying in cash | ... | 345,559 | 16,84,683 | 4,67,225 | 119,301 | 6,36,091 | 1,71,147 |\n| Total | ... | 1,175,388 | 56,56,950 | 36,09,687 | 415,712 | 2,98,049 | 10,60,199 |\n\n\u00b9 Board's Rec., 603, of August 16th, 1867; and 606, of September 25th, 1866.\nThe Government share, or the land revenue with cesses, and omitting the chaukidari cess, amounted to Rs. 11,19,579. Deducting this from the total of the zamindar's share, as given above, we get Rs. 35,50,637 as the zamindar's profit; and deducting both of these from the total value of the produce, or Rs. 78,84,999, we obtain Rs. 32,14,783 as the cultivator's share. The statistics for 1865-66 were prepared in the same manner by the same officers, and the details vary so little that it is unnecessary to give them here. The value of the produce is apparently less,\u2014in consequence, probably, of the deficiency in the rain-fall. The value of the total produce in 1865-66 is given at Rs. 76,31,089, of which the Government share amounted to Rs. 11,50,954, the zamindars' share to Rs. 34,53,008, and the cultivators' share to Rs. 30,27,127.\n\nThe Board of Revenue, in their review of the Saharanpur settlement report, give an estimate of the rental of the district for 1869-70.\n\nAccording to this, the Government share amounts to Rs. 11,65,540, the rental in cash to Rs. 15,70,700, and the rental in kind to Rs. 7,80,518, or a total of Rs. 23,51,218. Deducting from this the Government share, the zamindar's share in villages cultivated by others than the proprietors amounts to Rs. 11,85,678, as compared with Rs. 12,74,978 in 1864-65, and Rs. 12,48,321 in 1865-66. No account is apparently taken of their profits as proprietors when cultivating their own lands, nor is it shown how the value of the rent paid in kind is calculated, and the proportion between the amount of rent paid in cash and in kind differs considerably from that described to exist in the district notices. The total value of the produce is not given, so the cultivator's share is not ascertainable. The last attempt to settle this question was made at the census of 1872, which puts the rental of the district at Rs. 18,48,971, and the revenue at Rs. 12,94,062, giving the zamindar's share of the rental as Rs. 5,54,909. Here, again, we have no explanation as to how this result was arrived at, and must reject the figures as misleading. Altogether it would appear that in this district Government gets only one-seventh of the produce of the land, the remainder being pretty evenly divided between the cultivator and the proprietors.\n\nPayment in kind was the rule in this district until very recently. Mr. Thornton writes that \"a general opinion has prevailed in the district that rents must naturally be paid in kind, and that the substitution of a money rate is contingent on the consent of the cultivator. The process for ousting cultivators, too, has not been understood. On these accounts bhayachara villages with ill-conditioned owners were unsaleable. It was in vain to lay the proprietary right, as the men remained on the land. If such low rates in kind were not allowed as would leave the purchaser\n\n1 Set., Sept., I., 112.\nno profit, they grew the worst grains and rented land from their neighbours for their best crops.\" In 1863, Mr. VansAgnew writes:\u2014\"In 680 villages the tenants pay their rents in kind; in 760 villages they pay partly in money and partly in kind, and in 169 villages money-rents only prevail. Besides being so much in a minority, money-rents are clearly abnormal, and it is highly probable that they seldom obtained, excepting under peculiar circumstances, and where the cultivator had some claim to consideration and to easy terms, either from being a kinsman of the zamind\u00e1r, or from holding long on easy terms, or, from wherever derived, from some undefined but understood right to a share in the proprietor's dues. One proof of the favourable nature of the money-rents here is the great struggle always going on for them on the part of the tenants, and for payment in kind on that of the zamind\u00e1rs. All the tenants in this district wish for the former, and, it appears to me, consider them to convey a quasi-proprietary title, and the zamind\u00e1rs never concede them.\" This struggle still goes on, and even now (1875) the landholders always take the earliest possible opportunity of reverting to rents in kind, and the cultivators always resist it. Mr. VansAgnew does not give any areas. Mr. Robertson found 16,000 acres out of 208,435 acres paying cash rates, and Mr. Wynne found 139,605 out of 558,553 acres, altogether about twenty per cent., under cash rates. In the Nakur and Saharanpur tahsils payment in kind seems to be most common, and in Deoband and R\u00farki cash rents prevail. The enactment of Act XIV. of 1863 gave a great impetus to the commutation of produce for cash rents. In 1864-65, 221,774 acres were recorded as held by tenants paying in kind; against 251,350 acres held on cash rates. In the following year the numbers were 187,628 and 270,596, respectively. In 1869-70, the returns show that 66 per cent. of the holdings paid rent in cash only, and the remainder in cash and kind. Where rent is paid in kind, the proprietor takes from one-third to one-half the produce, but more commonly one-half (nief). Sugar-cane is charged for at the rate of from one to two rupees per kuchcha bigha, cotton at fourteen annas to one rupee, and chart at six to eight annas. These are called zabi crops. There are no statistics that can be relied upon to show the influence of the rent laws on rent-rates. In the Nakur tahsil there has been some enhancement.\n\nRent-rates are tolerably steady throughout the district, being from fourteen to sixteen annas per kuchcha bigha (one-sixth of an acre) on the best land, and five or six annas on the worst. The average is about ten or twelve annas, but in the northern parganahs, grant-lands recently brought under cultivation will not fetch more than three annas per kuchcha bigha. The small number of cases in which rent in cash was taken up to the end of Mr. VansAgnew's settlement renders any conclusions from his rates misleading. The assumed rent-rates of his successors are equally use-\nless for my purpose, as they made their assessments very considerably in advance of the rents which in many cases were actually paid. As early as 1842, there were 314 estates which had reached a state of cultivation that obtained from Government \"a guarantee that the revenue upon them should not be increased until the revenue-rate on the cultivable area of all contiguous villages exceeded the incidence of the revenue-rate in these estates.\" Certain statements prepared by the Settlement Officers would show that between 1865-66 and 1868-69 the rental of those villages recommended for permanent settlement had increased 29\u00b725 per cent., and where canal-irrigation had come amongst them, to 49\u00b76 per cent. The Board consider that \"a further rise in the rent-roll throughout the district will undoubtedly take place, the district being in a transition, and on the whole, in a backward state.\" The competition for land and the tendency towards cash rents both help to push up the value of land, which is the tendency of the processes now going on.\n\nFor a series of years after the conquest, hard seasons and injudicious settlements combined with the action of the Civil Courts to produce extensive alienations of property. Few of the old respectable families retain their estates, which have fallen principally into the hands of the Saharanpur money-lenders. Mr. VansAgnew's report contains a statement from which it appears that, during the twenty years of Mr. Thornton's settlement (1839-40 to 1859-60), 53 whole estates and 725 portions of estates, having an area of 110,390 acres, and yielding a revenue of Rs. 85,979, and valued at Rs. 6,18,895, were transferred by private arrangement: the transfers under decrees of the Civil Court during the same period amounted to 18 entire villages and 895 portions of villages, having an area of 104,356 acres, and giving a revenue of Rs. 1,15,301 and valued at Rs. 4,74,420, and in addition 12 whole estates and 621 parts of estates were mortgaged. The transfers in the Saharanpur parganah amount to 42 per cent., and if mortgages be added, to 60 per cent., the average of the district being 19 and 26 per cent., respectively. The averages for the Saharanpur tahsil are 32 and 49 against 13 and 3\u00bd for Rurki, 13 and 4 for Deoband, and 19 and 24 for Nakur. Transfers were most numerous in the parganahs lightly assessed, and which gave the best return for the investment of money.\n\nThe mutiny, too, did something towards increasing the number of transfers. Twenty-seven entire villages and 48 portions of villages were confiscated for rebellion in 1857, and of these 24 villages and 19 portions of villages were given away in reward for loyal service. The remaining estates were sold by auction to the highest bidder. That the process of transfer is still in vigorous action, the following table from the Board's\n\n---\n\n1 For details see the parganah notices.\nrecords continuing the alienation returns up to 1871-72 will clearly demonstrate:\n\n| Year | Under orders of Court | Sale | Aggregate revenue of property transferred | Number of cases | Total number of cases | By private transfer | Sale | Aggregate revenue of property transferred | Number of cases | Total number of cases |\n|------|-----------------------|------|------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------------|---------------------|------|------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------------|\n|      |                       |      |                                          |                |                      |                     |      |                                          |                |                      |\n| 1860-61 | 171                  | 8,198 | 334                                      | 505            | 200                  | 10,139              | 939  | 128                                     | 1,267          |\n| 1861-62 | 167                  | 4,590 | 562                                      | 729            | 384                  | 13,510              | 1,034| 261                                     | 1,619          |\n| 1862-63 | 149                  | 6,165 | 327                                      | 476            | 301                  | 10,174              | 1,413| 149                                     | 1,663          |\n| 1863-64 | 129                  | 3,934 | 288                                      | 412            | 299                  | 12,729              | 1,050| 181                                     | 1,530          |\n| 1864-65 | 102                  | 3,102 | 280                                      | 382            | 269                  | 98,667              | 1,207| 144                                     | 1,630          |\n| 1865-66 | 112                  | 3,115 | 299                                      | 411            | 278                  | 22,450              | 1,236| 217                                     | 1,731          |\n| 1866-67 | 102                  | 2,299 | 218                                      | 320            | 861                  | 18,205              | 1,003| 283                                     | 1,647          |\n| 1867-68 | 135                  | 3,186 | 279                                      | 414            | 370                  | 14,152              | 1,869| 302                                     | 2,541          |\n| 1868-69 | 160                  | 4,039 | 235                                      | 385            | 418                  | 15,146              | 975  | 521                                     | 1,914          |\n| 1869-70 | 143                  | 2,713 | 180                                      | 323            | 479                  | 18,187              | 1,637| 585                                     | 2,731          |\n| 1870-71 | 195                  | 6,718 | 203                                      | 398            | 378                  | 10,482              | 2,354| 335                                     | 3,057          |\n| 1871-72 | 102                  | 2,824 | 102                                      | 531            | 11,457               | 2,027               | 356  | 2,914                                   |\n\nThe prices brought by the lands transferred during Mr. Thornton's settlement give an average of no more than six times the revenue demand, or, taking the assessment at two-thirds the assets, only 4\u00bd times the rental or 18 times the presumed profits. The transfers by private sale for the whole district average nine per cent., and brought an average value of Rs. 6-8-4 per acre, assessed at an average revenue of Rs. 1-0-10 per acre. The transfers by decree of Court amounted to ten per cent. on the total area, and brought in an average value of Rs. 4-5-1 per acre, assessed at an average revenue amounting to Rs. 1-6-8. The mortgage transfers amount to seven per cent. of the total area, and show a value of Rs. 7-8-1 per acre and assessed at Re. 0-15-2. Taking the whole of these transfers for the entire district, the average selling price per acre is Rs. 5-14-6 for land assessed at an average revenue of Re. 1-0-1 per acre. The selling price of land is now Rs. 30 to Rs. 60 per acre. Land near towns, of course, fetches a much higher price.\nThe most industrious classes as well as the laziest seem to have lost by vendors and vendees transfers. The following table shows the number of villages and portions of villages alienated, and the number still remaining to the principal castes in 1863:\n\n| Caste          | Entire estates | Paris. | Entire | Paris. | Entire | Paris. |\n|----------------|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Sayyids        | 6              | 55     | 18     | 47     | 19     | 102    |\n| Shakhis        | 4              | 25     | 21     | 18     | 25     | 48     |\n| Pathans        | 5              | 50     | 17     | 40     | 22     | 90     |\n| Rajputs (Hin.) | 15             | 274    | 117    | 194    | 132    | 468    |\n| Rajputs (Mus.) |                | 25     | 12     | 19     | 19     | 44     |\n| Brahmins       | 5              | 9      | 5      | 11     | 10     | 30     |\n| G\u00fajars         | 14             | 439    | 160    | 379    | 174    | 818    |\n| Tagas          | 8              | 67     | 19     | 64     | 27     | 131    |\n| Jats           | 51             | 22     | 22     | 22     | 73     |\n| Sainis         | 1              | 3      | 10     | 5      | 11     | 8      |\n| G\u00e1ris          | 1              | 70     | 19     | 44     | 20     | 114    |\n| Others         | 15             | 253    | 158    | 249    | 178    | 501    |\n\nSo much for those who have lost their lands. The new landlords are nearly in all cases the money-lenders, dwellers in towns, the worst possible class of absentees. Mr. Wynne says of them:\u2014\"The power and influence of the money-lending class is rapidly increasing, and is, in my opinion, most mischievous. It is true that they are men of large capital, able, if they cared, to turn the land to the very best account, whereas the dispossessed proprietor must have been deprived of every particle of capital and credit alike before he parted with his ancestral share. But it is no part of the money-lender's scheme to lay out money on his purchase. He will raise the rents, and will, by studiously breaking down all rights that do not emanate from himself, by reducing the favoured and unfavoured tenants alike to one uniform level and then taking all he can from each of them, make the estate pay him far more than it paid before, but this result is attained at a sacrifice of all the comfort and contentment that characterized the village under its former owner. It is no matter of astonishment\nthat the money-lender, transformed into a landlord, should be so bad a landlord. None of the traditions of his caste guide him in his new profession. He understands the art of making money in his own proper line, but does not understand the particular demands of his new profession, or see that his true interest requires that he should undergo some outlay if he wishes to secure a large return. Add to this that the extremely illiberal pursuit, to which his main attention continues to be devoted, unfita him for dealing liberally with anyone, yet seasonable liberality is admittedly the first requisite in the management of a tenantry. Add, finally, the fact that he is invariably an absentee, and manages his estate through an agent. It will be easily imagined how this circumstance tends to keep him dissevered from his tenants and ignorant of what measures their requirements and his own interests alike demand.\"\n\nOwing to the rise in prices during the last few years and the increased demand for labour caused by such works as the Ganges and Jumna Canals, the railway and the R\u00fcrki Workshops, wages generally have risen. The wages of bricklayers and carpenters have risen from three and four annas a day to five and six annas; of blacksmiths from three and four annas to five annas; of well-sinkers (chahkun) from twelve annas per lineal foot to one rupee, common labourers from eighteen pie to two and two and a half annas, and women and children in proportion. The approximate number of landless, unskilled labourers in the district is 190,692. Of these a large number, calculated at 51,950, mostly Cham\u00e1rs, Kah\u00e1rs, Sainis, G\u00e1ras, Jhojhas, &c., work in the fields. Their wages vary according to the season of the year and the nature of the work to be performed; thus reapers get daily one sheaf supposed to contain from four to five sers pukka of grain, a ploughman may get one-eighth of the crop, weavers are paid two annas a day and upwards, or from 5 to 6 sers of grain a day, one kuchcha bigha representing 12 hours' work. They are paid better for weeding cotton than for weeding sugar-cane; the rate of wages in the former case sometimes rising to three annas or seven sers of grain per kuchcha bigha. Generally speaking, however, no rules can be laid down about the wages of agricultural labourers, which in a great measure depend upon the terms of the contract made, and probably differ more or less in every village according to local custom. Women and children are also often employed in field labour, the former chiefly in plucking cotton, for which they get sometimes from a tenth to a fourth of the amount plucked, and sometimes one rupee per kuchcha bigha of work done, or one and a half annas a day; for plucking safflower they get as much grain as the flower plucked, or one-half of the original commodity itself. The nominal rate of wages for female labourers is six pice and for children about four pice, but there is reason to believe that the latter are rarely, if ever, paid separately; the work of both seems really to be taken\ntogether and remunerated according to the amount done, not by a system of daily wages.\n\nThe following table gives the prices of the principal articles of agricultural produce and provisions in the central tahsil of Saharanpur and the north-eastern tahsil of R\u00farki for the years 1861 to 1870.

Besides horses, trinkets of all sorts and articles of clothing of every kind find a ready market among the pilgrims. The fair is attended by about 400,000 persons, and lasts eight days. Some further remarks about the Hardwar fair will be found under the notice of Hardwar town. A fair, attended by about ten to fifteen thousand people and lasting two days, is held in September for the purpose of bathing in the Ganges at Jagatiwala and at Nainakman or Manikmanu. Near the city is a small fair, where the people assemble from a radius of from forty to fifty miles. A large fair takes place at Indarpur Bhawan, and lasts for five days in September-October. There are few indigenous manufactures and none of any great note. In all the larger towns the weavers make a coarse cloth called garad; Rampur has been nicknamed R\u0101mpur Manihar\u0101n because bracelets (ch\u0101ris) and such like ornaments are there extensively made by the workers in glass; skilful silversmiths and goldsmiths are to be found almost everywhere, and the capital town is famous for its artists in wood-carving, as well as for the confection of a very popular sweetmeat called peta. This is about all that can be said of indigenous manufactures.\n\nThe R\u016brki Workshops were originally established in connection with the R\u016brki Workshops. Ganges Canal works in the year 1843, on a very modest scale, being then something between a timber-yard, a smithy, and a carpenter's shop. In 1848, Lieutenant A. Allen, of the 55th Native Infantry, was appointed to take charge of the establishment, which from that date began to develop rapidly. Within a year, the most necessary portion of the buildings, including lathe, model and engine accommodation, was completed; and in 1851, a supply of machinery, among which was a ten horse-power condensing steam engine, with boilers, was sent out from England by the Court of Directors. Up to this time the shops had been exclusively employed upon the manufacture of articles required for the Ganges Canal Works, and the demand for surveying and mathematical instruments at the R\u016brki Civil Engineering College first suggested the advisability of utilizing them in other ways. In 1852, the establishment ceased to have any connection with the Ganges Canal, and was placed under the superintendence of Lieutenant Allen, as a self-supporting institution. Its duties were to be three-fold,\u2014the supply of iron and wood for general purposes, the manufacture and repair of mathematical instruments, and iron founding. Until\n\n---\n\n1 By Mr. G. R. Williams, C. S. 2 Cuatley's Report on the Ganges Canal, Vol. II., p. 336, and No. 236. of Professional Papers on Indian Engineering, by Mr. A. Campbell, printed at the Thomason College Press.\nMarch, 1864, \"the workshops progressed in size and capacity for executing work, but their financial condition was neglected, and the consequence was a loss to Government of Rs. 4,24,455 in a period of 11\u00bd years, without making allowance for the use of capital provided by the State. Since then the profits have been large, and in 1868-69 reached Rs. 1,28,909. In 1870-71, however, the net profits fell to Rs. 59,608. Some useful calculations by Mr. Campbell, are appended:\n\n| Period                        | Value of work executed | Value of capital | Net profit | Percentage of profit on capital per annum |\n|-------------------------------|------------------------|------------------|------------|------------------------------------------|\n| 1st March, 1864, to 30th April, 1866, 14 months | 8,35,282               | 10,82,845        | 63,164     | 5                                        |\n| 1st May, 1866, to 1st May, 1866, 12 months       | 2,80,593               | 9,72,088         | 29,270     | 3                                        |\n| 1st May, 1866, to 1st April, 1867, 11 months    | 3,28,818               | 9,53,144         | 60,199     | 6                                        |\n| 1st April, 1867, to 1st April, 1868, 12 months  | 3,82,441               | 11,03,371        | 1,00,178   | 9                                        |\n| 1st April, 1868, to 1st April, 1869, 12 months  | 4,76,041               | 11,78,616        | 1,28,909   | 11                                       |\n\n\"The works contain a turning shop worked by a 20 horse-power engine, a foundry with a 12 horse-power engine, a smith's shed with two steam hammers, a scrap furnace for wood fuel, a fitting and boiler-making shop with a steam rivetter, a pattern shop, a carpenter's shop with saw mills driven by a 10 horse-power engine, and lastly a mathematical instrument shop. The range of work executed is very great.\" Here are made, among other things, steam engines of all sorts, pumps, printing presses, hydraulic presses, planing, slotting and drilling machinery, lathes, levels, prismatic and surveying compasses, and scientific instruments in general; bridge and girder work of every kind is also executed. The profit derived from the establishment is a very slight consideration compared with the advantages ensuing from the consequent improvement that may be expected in the mechanical skill of native artisans. The R\u00farki Workshops, three years ago, employed no less than 141 Muhammadan and 277 Hindu artisans, besides 143 Muhammadan and 508 Hindu labourers; in all 1,069. The wages of the former in the mathematical instrument department vary from twenty to four annas a day and in other departments from eight to three and a half annas a day. Mr. A. Campbell, a very shrewd observer, bears testimony to the superior activity and intelligence of the Muhammadan workmen, which he justly attributes to their having more ambition than the Hindus, over whom they appear to have a moral ascendancy. A plan of the foundry and workshops will be found in a professional paper by that gentleman, referred to in a preceding footnote.\nAn institution of still greater local importance is the Thomason Civil Engineering College, so called after its founder the late Lieutenant-Governor of these Provinces. The origin of the Thomason College was due to the want felt, during the construction of the great canal-works and roads, of some systematic training for Civil Engineers in this country. To this was added the professional skill required by the various committees appointed in each district to administer the funds of the ferry and road collections, and the demands of the Great Trigonometrical and Revenue Surveys. The well-educated European required instruction in the native languages, especially in the vernacular terms of science and also in the peculiarities of materials and construction in this country, whilst the uneducated subordinate staff required scientific instruction to develop their energy and usefulness.\n\nEfforts were at first made to supply these wants by existing institutions, but resulted in failure. In January, 1845, Lieutenant Baird Smith, R.E., undertook to conduct an engineering class for native youths at Saharanpur. Certain allowances were made for this purpose, and two of the more advanced scholars in the Agra and Delhi Colleges were placed under his superintendence, whilst masters were appointed to those institutions to instruct in architectural drawing and surveying. The first great impetus to scientific study was given by the establishment in 1845 of the grade of Sub-Assistant Executive Engineer, with a special standing and privilege, which afforded a certain reward to study, and created a superior class of subordinate officials in the Public Works Department.\n\nThe determination of Lord Hardinge, in 1847, to commence the Ganges Canal, again raised the question of the necessity for a well-trained staff of experienced Civil Engineers who should be able to face all the difficulties arising in a large undertaking of this nature. Out of this emergency Roorkee College had its rise. Its establishment there was due to the presence of the large workshop, and extensive structures in course of formation for the head-works of the canal with the necessary scientific appliances where the pupils could practically work out the problems submitted to them in their daily course of study. Lieutenant Maclean was appointed the first Principal in October, 1847, and in January of the following year, the first pupils were enrolled. It was not, however, until the middle of the year that the preparations were completed and the institution was in full session. War, too, came to interrupt its progress. In 1848-49 the second Panjab War broke out, and the Principal, Head-master and Military students were obliged to leave their studies for the field, where they were absent for two months on active duty. In 1850 the military students were increased from 10 to 15, and the period of their stay at the college was prolonged to a year, the first six months being probationary. The stipendiary students, drawing five rupees\na month, whilst kept at the same salary to the number of sixteen, had a higher class granted them, by which eight of their number drew a double allowance. Up to July, 1850, the expenditure amounted to Rs. 35,277. In 1851 there were 50 students, and 42 had already entered the public service. In 1852 proposals were made and sanctioned for an improved building, and the establishment of a press and workshop in connection with the College, whilst a library was formed, and an increase was made to the educational staff.\n\nThe original prospectus of the college explains the object of its foundation, which was to give theoretical and practical instruction in Civil Engineering to Europeans and Natives, with a view to their employment on the public works of the country, according to their several qualifications and the requirements of the service. The rules and regulations of the institution have been considerably modified since the year 1852, but its duties remain the same. The progress which it has made in performing them may be judged from the fact that the list of passed students for 1848 contains only three names\u2014two in the upper subordinate class and one in the lower; the former of two gunners in the artillery, the latter of one solitary native student from the Dehli College. The list for 1871 gives the names of eighteen gentlemen (officers and others) belonging to the engineering classes, of 54 students (privates, non-commissioned officers, natives and others) belonging to the upper subordinate classes, and of 48 natives belonging to the lower subordinate classes; so that in that year no less than 112 students qualified for the public service, and to this total should be added the names of nine students belonging to the officers' surveying class. The college calendar gives a full account of the curriculum.\n\nThe following statement shows the number of estates on the revenue-roll of the districts, with their land-revenue, and the number of registered proprietors paying revenue direct to Government, at five different periods:\n\n| Year       | Number of estates | Number of registered proprietors or occupiers | Total revenue-demand | Average demand from each estate | Average revenue paid by each proprietor | Expenditure on revenue administration |\n|------------|-------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| 1806       | 1,099             |                                             |                      |                               |                                        | Not known Rs. 73,102                  |\n| 1850-51    | 1,781             | 3,887                                       | 10,58,441            | 601                           | 277                                    | 74,598                                |\n| 1860-61    | 1,908             | 3,823                                       | 10,93,086            | 678                           | 286                                    | 61,842                                |\n| 1870-71    | 1,916             | 3,859                                       | 11,63,889            | 607                           | 299                                    | 66,100                                |\n| 1879-7A    | 1,916             | 3,815                                       | 11,72,999            | 612                           | 302                                    |                                      |\n\n1.

There were 1,184 incomes between Rs. 500, and Rs. 750 per annum, 364 between Rs. 750 and Rs. 1,000, 298 between Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 1,500, 140 between Rs. 1,500 and Rs. 2,000, 399 between Rs. 2,000 and Rs. 10,000, and 27 between Rs. 10,000 and Rs. 1,00,000. The total number of persons assessed was 2,412, and their total income was Rs. 36,54,741.\n\nIn 1871-72 there were 4,732 documents registered under the provisions of the Registration Act (VIII. of 1871), on which fees to the amount of Rs. 12,848 were collected. The expense of establishment, &c., during the same period amounted to Rs. 5,530. There were 2,222 registrations affecting immovable property, in which the registration was compulsory under Section 17 of Act VIII. of 1871, and 894 in which the registration was optional. The other registrations effected refer to movable property, wills, &c., and the total aggregate values of all the documents registered amounted to Rs. 13,18,593.\n\nThe net receipts on account of excise amounted to Rs. 21,394 in 1862-63, and rose to more than double that amount in 1871-72. At the close of the latter year there were 82 shops for the sale of native liquors, and 15 shops for the sale of English spirituous and fermented liquors in the district. Thirteen licensed stills were at work, and 18,302 gallons of liquor were issued during the year.

On the Ganges Canal there are 20 sets of mills at Kankhal, eight at Bahadurabad, two at Roorkee, six at Amnagar, and six at Muhammadpur. On the Jumna Canal there are altogether seven mills.\nafter the years in question the Saharanpur accounts cannot be separated from those of Dehra D\u00fcn.\n\nThe most ancient remains belonging to this district should most probably be some of the ruins about Hardwar and Mayapur on the Ganges, but it is so difficult to assign a specific date to any particular building, that we must take the golden l\u00e1t of Firuz Shah Tughlak, now at Delhi, as the oldest monument having any connection with this district the history of which is known. Shams-i-Sir\u00e1j Aff\u00ed, in his chronicles of the reign of Firuz Shah, mentions the removal of the mindra-i-zar\u00edn or golden l\u00e1t (obelisk) from the village of Tobra, in the district of S\u00e1laura and Khirzabad at the foot of the hills (Koh-payah), ninety kos from Delhi, to Firuz\u2019s new capital of Firuzabad, where it was placed in the palace constructed by Firuz near the Jama Masjid. He describes the mode of the removal of the l\u00e1t, and its re-erection in Delhi; and, as he says that he was twelve years of age at the time, he was probably also an eye-witness. Firuz Shah reigned from 1351 to 1388 A.D., so that the removal probably took place about 1379 A.D. The chronicler reports the tradition concerning the pillar\u2014that the column had been \u201cthe walking-stick of the accursed Bh\u00edm, a man of great stature and size. The annals of the infidels record that this Bh\u00edm used to devour a thousand maunds of food daily, and no one could compete with him. In his days all this part of Hind was peopled with infidels, who were continually fighting and slaying each other. Bh\u00edm was one of five brothers (the P\u00e1ndavas), but he was the most powerful of them all. He was generally engaged in tending the herds of cattle belonging to his wicked brothers, and he was accustomed to use the stone pillars as sticks to gather the cattle together.\u201d The same tradition is universal throughout these Provinces to the present day. This and similar monoliths in Bahar, Gorakhpur, Gh\u00e1zipur, and Allahabad are still called Bh\u00edm Sen ke gada (club).\n\nShams-i-Sir\u00e1j further notes that \u201cafter it was raised, some ornamental fringes of black and white stone were placed around its two capitols, and over these there was raised a gilded copper cupola, called in Hindi kal\u00e1s (spire or pinnacle),\u201d and hence the name mindra-i-zar\u00edn or golden l\u00e1t. \u201cOn the base of the obelisk there were engraved several lines of writing in Hindi characters. Many Brahmans and Hindu devotees were invited to read them, but no one was able. It is said that certain infidel Hind\u00fas interpreted them as stating that no one should be able to remove the obelisk from its place till there should arise in the latter days a Muhammadan King named Sult\u00e1n Firuz, &c.\u201d The writing remained undeciphered until 1837-38, when it yielded, to the untiring industry and energy of James Prinsep, the discovery that the older writing on\n\n---\n\n1 See Hardwar and Mayapur under the Gazetteer list of the district.  \n2 Dowson\u2019s Elliot, III., 350.\nit contained a transcript of the edicts of the great Buddhist Emperor Asoka, who lived in the third century before Christ. Several guesses had already been made as to the characters employed. Thus Edward Terry says that he was told by Tom Coryate that there was a pillar of marble in Delhi with a Greek inscription; whilst Purohas notices that the inscriptions were in Greek and Hebrew, and that \"some affirm the pillar was erected by Alexander the Great.\" The characters are those of the ancient Pali, or spoken language of that day, and are thus described by General Cunningham:\n\n\"The alphabetical characters, which are of the oldest form that has yet been found in India, are most clearly and beautifully cut, and there are only a few letters of the whole record lost by the peeling off of the surface of the stone. The inscription ends with a short sentence, in which King Asoka directs the setting up of these monoliths in different parts of India.\"\n\nThe record consists of four distinct inscriptions on the four sides of the column facing the cardinal points, and of one long inscription immediately below, which goes completely around the pillar. The last ten lines of the eastern face, as well as the whole of the continuous inscription round the shaft, are peculiar to the Delhi pillar, and contain new forms similar to those on the rock inscription at Kalsi in the D\u00fcn. A second inscription records the victories of the Chauhan Prince Visala Deva, which has already been noticed in the introduction. General Cunningham identifies Khizrabad with the present village of that name on the Jumna, just below the spot where the river issues from the hills in parganah Faizabad of this district. S\u00e1laura is clearly Sadhaura, a large place only a few miles west of Khizrabad. The name of the village from whence the obelisk was brought is variously written Topur, Topera, Toparsuk, Tohera, Tawera, Tobra and Nahera, and the same writer identifies it with Paota, on the western bank of the Jumna, about twelve miles north-east of Khizrabad. According to Shams-i-Siraj \"the height of the obelisk was thirty-two gaz; eight gaz were sunk in its pedestal, and twenty-four gaz were visible.\" General Cunningham found it to consist of \"a single shaft of pale pinkish sandstone 42' 7\" in length, of which the upper portion (35') has received a very high polish, while the remainder is left quite rough. Its upper diameter is 25'8 inches, and its lower\n\n---\n\n1 \"Dillee, which signifies a heart, and is seated in the heart of the Mogul's territories.

I was told by Tom Coryate (who took special notice of this place) that he, being in the city of Dillee, observed a very great pillar of marble with a Greek inscription upon it, which time had almost quite worn out, erected (as he supposed) there and then by Great Alexander, to preserve the memory of that famous victory.\"\u2014Terry's Voyages (London, 1665) reprinted, 1777, p. 77.\n\n2 Arch.

Then we come to the journeys of the Chinese traveller Hwen Thsang in the middle of the seventh century of our era. In travelling from Thanesar, Hwen Thsang at first proceeded south for some seventeen miles, to the Gokantha monastery, and thence for 67 miles to Srughna. The kingdom of Srughna is described as extending to the hills on the north and the Ganges on the east. The town itself was situated on the west bank of the Jumna, and was 3\u00bd miles in circuit. The greater part was even then in ruins, but the foundations still remained. It possessed five monasteries, one hundred temples, and many stupas. General Cunningham identifies Srughna with the village of Sugh, situated on a projecting triangular spur of high land, surrounded on three sides by the old bed of the Jumna, now the western Jumna canal, and opposite to Bahat in the Faizabad parganah. Tradition and the discovery of large bricks and extensive finds of old coins all point out the antiquity of the present site of the village and that of the neighbouring village of Mandalpur. Mahmud in his twelfth expedition,* or that against Kanauj, passed along the foot of the hills under Kashmir, and crossed the Jumna, in 1018 A.D., whence he proceeded down the Duhab to Baran (Bulandshahr). Abu Rihan, who wrote during this time, mentions in his itinerary, that \"from Kanauj going north, and turning a little to the west, you come to Sharash\u00e1raha, fifty parasangs, then to Pinjor, eighteen parasangs.\" Elliot identifies this place with Sars\u00e1wa or Sir\u00e1wa, sometimes called Siraspatan, an old town lying ten miles to the east of Sugh, and on the line of road usually followed by the invaders of India from the west. On his return from Kanauj, Mahmud is said to have attacked \"Chand Rai, one of the greatest men of Hind, who resided in the fort of Sharwa,\" which General Cunningham identifies with Sars\u00e1wa* or perhaps with Sugh, and adds:\u2014\n\n\"But whichever of the two places is intended, it is certain that the high road from the Gangetic Duhab to the upper Panjab must have crossed the gh\u00e1t between them.\" Al Utbi relates that there had been constant war between Chand Rai and Pur\u00fa Jaip\u00e1l, the ruler of the Panjab, and that at last the latter sought a compromise, and sent his son Bh\u00edmp\u00e1l to receive the daughter of Chand Rai in marriage. Chand Rai imprisoned the son, and demanded compensation for the losses which had been inflicted by the father, and war continued between\n\n---\n\n1 Arch. Sur., II., 226. 2 Dowson's Elliot, II., 48, 458. 3 Ibid., I., 61.\n4 Dowson's Elliot, II., 47; Arch. Sur. II., 230.\nthem as before. This was the state of affairs on the arrival of Mahmud, who, on his return from Kanauj, determined to reduce the Hindu prince to subjection. In the meantime, by the advice of Bhimpal, his prisoner, Chand Rai abandoned his fort and retreated to the hills, lest he should suffer the fate of the uncles and relations of Bhimpal, who were made Musalmans \"when they demanded quarter in their distress.\" The Sultan captured the fort and pursued the fugitives to the hills, where in January, 1019 A.D., shortly before midnight, he came upon the enemy in the midst of the forest, and defeated them with great slaughter. The booty amounted in gold, silver, and precious stones to 300,000 dirhams, and \"the number of prisoners may be conceived from the fact that each was sold for from two to ten dirhams.\" It is said that the fifth share due to the Sayyids was 150,000 slaves. However this may be, there can be no doubt but that a great part of the northern portion of this district fell out of cultivation during this period, and that it was not for several centuries afterwards that much improvement took place.\n\nThe town of Saharanpur was not founded until the reign of Muhammad Tughlak (1325-1351 A.D.), and was named by him after Shah Haran Chishti, a celebrated p\u012br or Muhammadan saint, whose shrine still attracts a considerable assemblage of the devout. The progress of colonisation, which had been going on for some years, received some impetus from the invasion of the Mughals under Tarmasharin Khan, who, at this time, crossed the Jumna by the old route under the hills, and marched down the Doab plundering as they came. The Mughals were only got rid of by the grant of a large contribution in money. They did not, as one would expect, immediately return to India, though, in anticipation of such an event, the imperial posts were pushed northwards, and stations were occupied near the principal gh\u0101ts on the Jumna. It was in one of his progresses for the inspection of these posts through this district that Firuz Tughlak saw the Asoka column at Khirabad. In 1379 Firuz Shah passed through Ambala and Shahabad to the hills of Saharanpur, and after taking tribute from the Rais of Sirmor and the hills he returned to his capital. In 1384 he again visited the hills and spent two months in hunting the rhinoceros (kark) and the elk (gozan), and it was here that Muhammad Khan sought refuge when despairing of succeeding his father Firuz, and occupied the fort of Baktari or Baknari beyond Nahan.\n\nThe garrisons along the Jumna proved of little avail against the forces of the Mughal Emperor Timur, who, after the sack of Delhi in December, 1398 A.D., crossed into the Doab, and sweeping through Meerut and a part of the Bijnaur District, recrossed the Ganges near Hardwar: Timur himself gives an account in his memoirs of\n\n---\n\n1 Dowson's Elliot, IV, 14, 16, 17, 19.\n2 Malfuzat-i-Timuri in Dowson's Elliot, III, 455, 518.\nthe fights that took place. When he heard that the gabr, as he calls all that were not followers of Isl\u00e1m, had assembled near Hardw\u00e1r, he followed them, and ordered his men to charge. \"Spurring their horses, shouting their war-ory, and brandishing their swords, they fell upon the forces of the enemy like hungry lions upon a flock of sheep.\" The enemy broke and fled, and an immense booty was obtained. Tim\u00far had at this time only one hundred men with him as a personal guard, and was attacked by Malik Shaikha with a larger force. When about a bow-shot remained between the two parties, Tim\u00far asked a soldier in advance who those approaching, as if to attack, were. The soldier said that they belonged to the party of Shaikh K\u00fakar, one of Tim\u00far's officers, and on this Tim\u00far turned to retire. The enemy rushed on the Mughal troops, and would have annihilated them had not their own leader, Malik Shaikha, been slain in the first onset, when, as is the custom with orientals, his troops dispersed.\n\nA small party of the enemy, with the wives and children of those who had taken part in the first fight, took refuge at K\u00fapila (Hardw\u00e1r), about two kos off. When Tim\u00far heard of this, he marched there, and, joined by Prince Pir Muhammad Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr, attacked the fugitives. After a slight resistance the enemy took to flight, but many were slain, and the women and children, \"the property and goods, gold, money, grain, camels, horses, cows and buffaloes,\" fell as spoil to the soldiers. Tim\u00far would then appear to have pursued the remainder along the foot of the hills, where he spent some days plundering and destroying everything that came in his way. On his return he encamped at Bahrah, \"a dependency of Bakri well known as the country of Miy\u00e1pur,\" and halted the next day at Shikk S\u00e1r, a distance of four kos, and the next day went to Kandar. On leaving Kandar he crossed the Jumna. The Zafar-n\u00e1ma of Sharf-\u00fad-din Yazdi makes the stages Bahrah, Shikk-S\u00e1rs\u00e1wa and Kandar; where Tim\u00far gives the name S\u00e1r, his chronicler gives the name S\u00e1rs\u00e1wa. The position and the marches clearly corroborate the identification of S\u00e1r with the modern S\u00e1rs\u00e1wa. Mention is made that Fir\u00faz Shah conducted the stream of Fir\u00fazabad from the mountains of Mandati and Sirmor to Delhi. \u00b9 Firishta calls the place Mandawi, though Briggs has Mandui, Dow has Manduli, and Elliot has Mandir. The canal was drawn from the Jumna opposite Faizabad, and therefore the name may be identified with that of Mandalpur, close to Sugh. Sugh was therefore, so early as the fourteenth century, supplanted by Mandalpur.\n\nWe next find the ikt\u00e1 and shikk of Sah\u00e1r\u00e1npur bestowed by Sult\u00e1n Sayyid Kh\u00edzr Kh\u00e1n on Sayy\u00edd S\u00e1l\u00edm, the chief of the Sayyids Seyyd S\u00e1l\u00edm. in 1414 A.D.\u00b2 As this was about the date of the settlement of the Sayyids of B\u00e1rha in the adjacent district of Muzaffarnagar, it is probable that they went there under the protection of the Sayyid governor,\n\n\u00b9 Dowson's Elliot, IV., 8; Arch Sur. II., 330. \u00b2 T\u00e1rikh-i-Mubdrak Sh\u00e1hi, Dowson's Elliot, IV., 46.\nS\u00e1lim. In 1526 A.D., during his fifth expedition to India, B\u00e1bar passed through Sars\u00e1wa, and one of the skirmishes preceding the invader's victory over Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Lodi at P\u00e1nipat must have taken place in the neighbourhood of Titron, in parganah Gangoh of this district. The Turkm\u00e1n colonies of Lakhnauti and the neighbouring villages trace their origin to this expedition.\n\nIn the following year (933 Hijri) the famous saint Abdul Kadd\u00fas, a descendant of Ab\u00fa Hanifah, founded the Sar\u00e1i, or new town of Gangoh, where his descendants still reside. His mission was followed by the conversion of many of the Rajp\u00fat, G\u00f3jar and Taga inhabitants, and materially strengthened the Musalm\u00e1n element in the population. He was succeeded by his son Shaikh Rukn-ud-d\u00edn, who was amongst the learned men assembled at the court of Akbar at the time of Bair\u00e1m's fall. Shaikh Abdun-nabi, son of Shaikh Ahmad, and grandson of Shaikh Abdul Kadd\u00fas, was several times in Makka, where he studied of the Empire. the Had\u00eds. He succeeded the celebrated Maul\u00e1na Abdullah of Sult\u00e1npur in the favour of the court, and was at all times a man of mark at Delhi. He had many enemies, and amongst them was Makhd\u00fam-ul-mulk, who wrote a pamphlet charging the Shaikh with murder under pretence of punishing heresy; that it was wrong to say prayers with the Shaikh, who had been undutiful towards his father, and \"was, besides, afflicted with piles!\" Murder, unfilial conduct, and haemorrhoids were the cumulative charges on which the Ulamas who sided with Makhd\u00fam demanded the degradation of the Shaikh, and in this they were successful. The leaders of these factions, however, soon became friends again, for we find them joining in 1579 A.D. in a document, which made the order of the Im\u00e1m in all disputed questions of law final. From 1564 to 1577 A.D., Shaikh Abdun-nabi had been Sadr of the empire, during which time he gave much offence by his mode of treating the holders of State lands.\u00b9 The arbitrary execution of a Brahman led to his deposition from office; and in 1578 Akbar gave him money for the poor of Makka, and sent him on a pilgrimage. When he came back he was called to account for the money, was put into prison, and there murdered in 1584 A.D.\n\nDuring the reigns of Akbar's successors the district of Sah\u00e1r\u00e1npur was the chosen retreat of the nobles of the court, to whom its cool and comparatively healthy climate, and the facilities afforded for the amusement of hunting, rendered it peculiarly attractive. The Empress N\u00far Jah\u00e1n\u00b2 or Empress N\u00far Jah\u00e1n. N\u00far Mahal, the consort of Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr, resided for a short time in a G\u00fajar village to the north of the Tughlikpur parganah, where some remains of her mansion are still visible, and her name is perpetuated in\n\n\u00b9 Blochmann Afu-i-Akbari, 185, 490; Eliot, V, 542. \u00b2 She was known as Mahr-un-nis Khanum whilst the widow of Sher-Afkan, and received the title of N\u00far Mahal on her marriage with Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr, and was later called N\u00far Jah\u00e1n.\nthat of the village of N\u00farmagar. Under Shahjah\u00e1n, the celebrated Ali Mard\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n constructed the royal hunting seat still known as B\u00e1dsb\u00e1h Mahal. It lies to the north-west of the Faizabad parganah, on the left bank of the Jumna. The palace was pleasantly situated opposite to where the Delhi canal is drawn off, and its remains are now utilised as a modern house. To the same nobleman is due the construction of the Du\u00e1b canal, now known as the Eastern Jumna Canal. This canal was conducted, with a considerable knowledge of hydraulics, along the crest of the high ground between the Jumna and the Hindan, so as to admit of its water being thrown off on both sides for irrigation purposes. From the absence of traces of bridges and lateral off-shoots, it is supposed that the great difficulty experienced in the passage of the torrents which cross the line of canal, in the upper portion of its course, led to its early abandonment. It was realigned, completed and opened in 1830.\n\nThe first important irruption of the Sikhs took place during the reign of Bah\u00e1dur Shah in the year 1709. Under their chief, Bandu, they poured in irresistible numbers into Sirhind, murdering, plundering, and burning wherever they came. The Imperial Governor was defeated in a pitched battle, and the Sikhs gathering strength from this, crossed the Jumna and ravaged the Upper Du\u00e1b. Though the Musalm\u00e1ns were the first objects of their attack, the Sikhs were not restrained by any considerations of religion, or by any mercy for age or sex. Whole communities were massacred with wanton barbarity; and it is said that even the bodies of the dead were dug up and thrown out to the birds and beasts of prey. The Sikhs returned the following year, when the same scenes of outrage and violence were perpetrated, so that the Emperor himself was constrained to lead a force against them in 1710 A.D., which succeeded for a time in driving the enemy into the hills. The Emperor retired to Lahor, leaving a detachment to watch the enemy and prevent their approaching the Du\u00e1b. We do not hear much of them again until 1716 A.D., when Bandu, again issuing from his retreat, spread death in every direction, and threatened the Du\u00e1b. A force was sent against him under Abd-us-Samad Kh\u00e1n, who captured Bandu and nearly annihilated his followers. For many years after this the Sikhs remained quiet, recruiting their shattered forces, and it was not until the almost entire absence of authority in the Upper Du\u00e1b appeared to give them the desired opportunity for repeating their incursions, that we hear of them again.\n\nFrom 1712 to 1721 A.D., this district, with the neighbouring district of Muzaffarnagar, formed part of the possessions of the Sayyid brothers of B\u00e1rha. As their family is more intimately connected with the Muzaffarnagar District, the story of their romantic career will be found in the notice of that district. They belonged to the\nTihapuri branch of the Sayyid family settled at J\u00e1nath. Husain Ali was assassinated in 1721 A.D., and in the same year his brother, Shaikh Abdullah, lost the battle of Husainpur. Their possessions were conferred upon Muhammad Am\u00edn Kh\u00e1n, who succeeded in establishing his authority in this district. He was followed by the Vaz\u00edr Kumr-ud-d\u00edn, the implacable enemy of the B\u00e1rha Sayyids. In 1737 A.D. the Vaz\u00edr despatched one Marhamat Kh\u00e1n to the Sah\u00e1ranpur District, with orders to expel the Sayyids from their j\u00e1g\u00edrs. In carrying out these orders Marhamat Khan acted with such violence, that the Sayyids rose in rebellion and slew him. This was what the Vaz\u00edr most desired, and assembling an overwhelming force, he despatched it, under command of his own brother, Azimullah, who quickly overran the whole district, and utterly defeated the Sayyids at the memorable capture and sack of J\u00e1nath.\n\nIn the reign of Muhammad Shah, the fief of Sah\u00e1ranpur was conferred on Zafar Kh\u00e1n, better known by his title of Roshan-ud-daulah, and as the builder of the mosque which bears his name in the Ch\u00e1ndni Chauk at Dehli. This nobleman bestowed parganah Ambahta, in this district, upon Shah Muhammad B\u00e1kir, son of the famous Mir Shah Abdul Ma\u00e1li, whose descendants are in possession to the present day. Shortly after the accession of Ahmad Shah, in 1748 A.D., quarrels broke out between the Vaz\u00edr Safdar Jang and Shih\u00e1b-ud-d\u00edn, best known by the family affix of Gh\u00e1zi-ud-d\u00edn Kh\u00e1n, who had succeeded his uncle Naj\u00edb Kh\u00e1n. Gh\u00e1zi-ud-d\u00edn I. in command of the forces, Safdar Jang sent an army under Indargir Gosh\u00e1in, which ravaged the Upper D\u00fa\u00e1b, and occupied Sah\u00e1ranpur itself. In the battle of Kotila, which shortly afterwards took place, Naj\u00edb Kh\u00e1n joined the imperial forces under Gh\u00e1zi-ud-d\u00edn, and so distinguished himself that he obtained parganahs Sah\u00e1ranpur, B\u00farh\u00e1na, and all the B\u00e1rha villages in j\u00e1g\u00edr. Chait Singh of Bahsuma attempted for a time to resist his authority, but before the end of 1754, Naj\u00edb Kh\u00e1n had reduced his new possessions to obedience. Naj\u00edb Kh\u00e1n then devoted all his energies to the extension and consolidation of his power, and before his death, which occurred in 1770 A.D., his j\u00e1g\u00edr extended on the north, not only to the Siw\u00e1lik hills, but across them into the D\u00fan, which he conquered about 1757 A.D.; on the west they were bounded by the Jumna, and contained the fortrees of Ghanagarh; on the east they extended into the Bijnaur District, with the fortresses of Pathargarh and Naj\u00edbabad; and on the south he held Sh\u00e1mli, in the Muz\u00e1farnagar District, and the lands to the border of the present district of Meerut, which were commanded from his fort of Shukart\u00e1r.\n\nTowards the close of Naj\u00edb Kh\u00e1n's rule, the district suffered severely from the inroads of the Sikhs on the west, and the Marhatas on the south. The latter departed for a time on\n\n---\n\n1 Four distinct Sikh invasions are counted between the years 1761 and 1770.\nthe advance of the Afghans under Ahmad Shah Abdali. When Zabita Khan succeeded his father, Najib Khan, one of his first acts was to refuse the tribute due to the Emperor; and knowing that he was in disfavour with the court, then entirely under Marhatta influence, he set about collecting troops and fortifying the strong places in his district. Amongst these was Shukartar, where he awaited the attack of the royal army, and was completely defeated in 1772. The royal army then advanced through the Duab, and took possession of Saharanpur, and all the Rohilla forts except Ghausgarh, where Zabita's family resided; and having appointed a Governor, Shah Alam returned to Delhi. Shortly afterwards Zabita made peace with the Marhattas, and through their instrumentality received back his possessions. The year 1775 is marked by an invasion of the Sikhs, who plundered nearly every considerable town from Saharanpur to Meerut. Zabita Khan, finding himself powerless to oppose them, took numbers of these men into his employ, and strengthening himself by an alliance with their chiefs, openly rebelled against the Emperor. Abdul Kasim Khan, sent from Delhi against Ghausgarh, was slain in the attack, and until the arrival of Najf Khan, the imperial authority was little regarded in this district. A battle took place between the forces of Najf Khan and the Saharanpur troops near, Ghausgarh in 1777, which ended in a reconciliation, and the Rohilla chief was again pardoned and confirmed in his possessions.\n\nThe cis-Satlaj chiefs, irritated at the defection of the Rohilla, granted him Ghulam Kadir, 1785- little peace during the remainder of his life. He died 1788. in 1785, and was succeeded by his son Ghulam Kadir, a man of bold and determined character, and little likely to yield to his enemies without a struggle. He confiscated the jagirs of many of the principal men in his districts, and amongst them that of his own uncle, Afzal Khan. He then re-annexed the entire country possessed by his grandfather, which during the recent troubles had been occupied by the Sikhs, and reconquered the D\u00fcn. The Sikhs, too, were held in check, and the country, for the first time for many years, enjoyed peace under a strong Government. On his death, in 1788, the Marhattas took possession of the district, which remained with them until the British conquest. Ghani Bahadur was the first governor, and he was succeeded by Bala Rao.\n\nIn 1794 the Sikhs recommenced their inroads into the Duab, and succeeded, not only in defeating the Marhatta garrison at Saharanpur, but compelled them to take refuge in the fort of Jalalabad. Lakhwa Dada, on hearing this, applied for the services of George Thomas, then an adventurer in the service of Apa Khandi Rao in Mewat, to command a force of 2,000 infantry, 200 cavalry, and sixteen pieces of artillery, raised for the protection of the Marhatta possessions in this quarter, and assigned him parganahs Panipat, Sonpat and Karnal for their pay. Thomas remained\ntherefor some time and co-operated with Bapu Sindhia, who was named Governor of Saharanpur and the country adjacent, which at this time yielded a revenue of ten lakhs of rupees. Thomas distinguished himself in the reduction of Shaml\u0131, than in Gurdat Singh's j\u00e1g\u0131r, and in the siege of Lakhnauti; but on the death, by suicide in the Jumna, of his patron Apa Khandi Rao he withdrew for some time to his j\u00e1g\u0131r in Mewat, whence he was recalled to meet the Sikhs again. Thomas defeated the Sikhs in four successive actions near Karn\u00e1l, whilst Bapu Sindhia drove them from the northern parganahs of the Du\u00e1b, and even pushed his forces into their own country, which became for a time a scene of the same plunder and devastation with which they had so often laid waste the Du\u00e1b. In 1797 Thomas retired from Saharanpur to push his fortunes in Hari\u00e1na.\n\nIn 1799, Sambun\u00e1th\u00b9 a grain merchant, was the d\u00edw\u00e1n of Im\u00e1m Baksh Kh\u00e1n, Governor of Saharanpur, who sided with Lakhwa Perron. D\u00e1da in his feud with Sindhia. The d\u00edw\u00e1n took the field against M. Perron, the Marhatta commander of Aligarh; but his troops were corrupted by means of a large sum of money which Perron found means to distribute amongst them, and their leader was obliged to yield up a portion of the districts he held to save the rest. In the following year M. Perron left Dehli with a large force, in order to seize upon the remainder, and after a sharp action at Kh\u00e1tauli in the Muzaffarnagar District, was able to compel Sambun\u00e1th to leave the Du\u00e1b altogether, and take refuge with the Sikhs. As illustrative of the state of the country, the massacre of the Gosh\u00e1ins near Hardw\u00e1r by the Sikhs in 1796 may be mentioned. In fact, the greater portion of the Upper Du\u00e1b was still divided amongst the Sikh Sird\u00e1rs, ostensibly as j\u00e1girs, but in reality in lieu of black mail. The only portion of the district that enjoyed even the semblance of security was the strip of country on the east, stretching from Jaw\u00e1l\u00e1pur to Bahs\u00fama in Meerut, in which the G\u00fajar Raja R\u00e1mday\u00e1l Singh had assumed a semi-independent attitude.\n\nIn the year 1801, R\u00e1mday\u00e1l received the thanks of the Marhatta commander for crushing an insurrection headed by one Az\u00e1z Kh\u00e1n, at Bachaiti near Deoband. This adventurer gave himself out as the true Ghul\u00e1m K\u00e1dir; and the failure of his attempt was in a great measure due to the treachery of the G\u00fajars, who joined him only to have an opportunity of more effectually looting whichever side should prove victorious. On the fall of Aligarh and the capture of Dehli in 1803, a British force, under Colonel Burn, started from Dehli for Saharanpur in October, but had hardly reached the civil station, when news arrived of a threatened Sikh invasion, which would have\n\n\u00b9 Sambun\u00e1th was our first tah\u00e1s\u00edd\u00e1r at Saharanpur, and his grandson is now tah\u00e1s\u00edd\u00e1r of B\u00e1gp\u00e9t in the Meerut District.\nbeen converted into a real attack but for the arrival of James Skinner with a strong detachment of irregular horse. Presently news came of Colonel Monson's disastrous retreat, and Colonel Ochterlony, finding his position at Delhi precarious, recalled the commandant of Saharanpur, barely in time to save that city from Holkar's adopted son, Harinath. But just as General Lake's approach raised the siege of Delhi, intelligence was received of a Marhatta inroad. General Lake in person repulsed the Marhattas, but again a Sikh invasion (the thirteenth : October, 1804) took place. Sher Singh of Buriya was ravaging the district, while the Collector, Mr. Guthrie, remained shut up in the Kila Ahmadabadi, a fort built by Ghalam Kadir, and since converted into a jail. Colonel Burn marched to meet the Sikhs with Mr. Guthrie, who, having managed to escape from the fort with the assistance of the Begam Sumru, had joined the army at Khatauli. Sher Singh awaited the attack at Charaon in the Katha, where a fight, celebrated in local tradition, took place on the 24th November, 1804. The day, however, cannot be considered glorious to either side, for our irregular cavalry displayed such cowardice, that, had the Sikhs shown more determination, the event would have been very doubtful. Fortunately, the enemy dared not face our artillery, an arm with which they were not yet familiar. To this fact, Colonel Burn owed an indecisive victory. A cannon ball carried off Sher Singh's leg during the engagement, and his old uncle, Rai Singh, brought him back to die at Buriya. In spite of this lesson, the district was not yet safe. Intelligence of the fall of Digh alone prevented the Begam Sumru from turning against us, in spite of her professions of fidelity to General Lake; and Colonel Burn had not got rid of the Sikhs. We find them overrunning the country within a month of their defeat at Charaon.\n\nIn February, 1805, Amir Khan's wild Pindaris threatened to swoop across the Ganges opposite Muzaffarnagar, and some actually did venture over. In March, the commandant was summoned into Rohilkhand, but the moment he turned his back, the fifteenth Sikh invasion recalled him to the district. Fruitless negotiations interrupted the campaign which followed. Colonel Burn soon found it necessary to take upon himself the responsibility of breaking them off, and after resuming the last remaining Sikh jagir, Gurdat Singh's of Jhanjhana, he forded the Jumna and attacked Karnal (April). These energetic measures brought the Sirdars to their senses, and so ended the last Sikh invasion.\n\nComparative tranquillity prevailed down to the year 1813, when Raja Ramdayal Singh died, and the settlement operations consequent upon the resumption of his enormous estates were attended by a Gujar rising, which was happily quelled before it became\n\n1 Without including the innumerable minor incursions.\nserious. In 1814, the G\u00farkh\u00e1 war broke out, and the D\u00fan was, after a short interval of non-regulation, annexed temporarily to Sah\u00e1r\u00e1npur under Regulation IV. of 1817. A full account of the new subdivision will be found in the volume devoted to the hill districts.\n\nIn the year 1824, a variety of circumstances tended to cause a rising of a far more dangerous character than that of 1813. The principal leaders of the disturbance were two G\u00fajars: Kalw\u00e1, a famous bandit, and Biji Singh, talukad\u00e1r of K\u00fanja near R\u00farki, and a relative of Raj\u00e1 Ramday\u00e1l Singh. The rendezvous of the insurgents was at the latter's fort, where they were collecting in rapidly increasing numbers, strange to say, without the knowledge of the authorities, when two daring exploits, the sack of the town of Bhagw\u00e1npur and the plunder of a strong treasure escort, bringing in a large sum of money from the Jaw\u00e1l\u00e1pur tahsil, led to the disclosure of their movements. Mr. Grindall, the Magistrate of Sah\u00e1r\u00e1npur, obtaining a reinforcement of G\u00farkhas, under the command of Captain Young of the Simor Battalion, at once attacked them, in company with his Joint Magistrate, the Hon'ble Mr. Shore. The fight lasted all day, ending in the total discomfiture of the rebels, who lost nearly two hundred killed and wounded. Among the former were Kalw\u00e1 and Biji Singh. The enterprise thus nipped in the bud was no petty undertaking of ordinary marauders. It had been planned on a grand scale, and large reinforcements were coming to Biji Singh's assistance from this as well as other districts, when the unexpected fall of K\u00fanja made the whole confederacy collapse.\u00b9\n\nThe district is happily barren in historical events from 1824 to 1857, when the mutiny\u00b2 broke out at Meerut. Fortunately there was a man in Mr. R. Spankie, the Magistrate, who was equal to the emergency. News of the outbreak was received on the 12th of May, and on the following day the women and children were sent to the hills, and not too soon, for the day after came news of the massacre at Dehli. Extra police were raised, and the Europeans established themselves as a regular garrison in the Magistrate's house. The district soon rose; the G\u00fajars and Rangars especially made themselves notorious for their turbulence, and when the intelligence of the disturbances in Muzaffarnagar arrived, a general outbreak took place. Ancient feuds were renewed; village plundered village; bankers were robbed of their property, or had to pay black mail for its protection; and in many cases debtors took advantage of the general anarchy to obtain from the money-lenders\n\n\u00b9 The forests under Garhw\u00e1l and Kumaun were the favourite lurking-place of Kalw\u00e1 and his followers. The records of the office of the Commissioner of Kumaun show that, in concert with the authorities of Moradabad, frequent and fruitless efforts were made to dialogue him.\n\n\u00b2 From the official narrative, by Mr. R. Spankie, C.S, now the Hon'ble R. Spankie, Judge of the High Court, Allahabad.\ntheir account-books and bonds. Mr. Spankie writes:\u2014\"It would appear as if the disturbances in the commencement were less directed against Government than against particular people and castes. When the fall of Delhi ceased to be looked upon as imminent, the agricultural communities began to turn their eyes towards the local treasuries, and did not scruple to oppose themselves to Government officers and troops.\"\n\nThe local officers did their best to put down the disturbances in their earliest stage. On the 21st May, the raiders who plundered Malhaipur were punished; and on the following day a demonstration was made along the R\u00farki road as far as N\u00e1g\u00e1l, which resulted in the capture of some men who had refused to pay their revenue. Affairs in the city now assumed a serious phase. The kotw\u00e1l or head police officer, whilst appearing faithful, was in reality stirring up the people to disaffection. The shopkeepers shut up their shops, and, burying their valuables, prepared for the worst. Confidence was, however, restored for a time by the appearance of Mr. W. C. Plowden, with a party of cavalry and infantry under Captains Wyld and Garstin, from Jag\u00e1dri. Advantage was taken of their presence to make a raid on M\u00e1nikpur, then held by one Amrao Singh, who had set himself up as Raja. The village was taken and burned, but the rebels succeeded in effecting their escape. The late Mr. H. D. Robertson, C. S., was then despatched to Deoband, which was threatened by a rising of the Rajputs of the K\u00e1tha. In the meantime a portion of the native infantry at Sah\u00e1r\u00e1npur mutinied, and fired upon their officers (June, 2nd), fortunately without effect; and were it not for the opportune arrival of the G\u00farkhas under Major Bagot, it would have fared ill with the small European body at Sah\u00e1r\u00e1npur. The G\u00farkhas were next employed in dispersing a body of G\u00fajars who had come to attack the treasury, and were again sent to meet a body of the Jalandhar mutineers, 300 strong, in the south of the district.\n\nAbout this time news arrived of the plunder of Nak\u00far and Sars\u00e1wa by the G\u00fajars, and on the 9th of July the remainder of the native infantry (29th native infantry) fled from the station. Mr. Robertson did good service in the Ganges kh\u00e9d\u00edr, where, in conjunction with Captain Read, he defeated, at Fathua, the Banj\u00e1ras who had been committing great excesses in the more unprotected villages, and coming round by Deoband, he inflicted signal punishment on the rabble who had plundered one-third of that town (see DEOBAND). Mr. Robertson was recalled to Sah\u00e1r\u00e1npur to defend the city against an attack of G\u00fajars, K\u00e1tha Rajputs and Rangars, who, aided by the lower Mussalm\u00e1n population, proposed an attack upon the European quarters and the jail. The jail guard was disarmed, and the duty was handed over to the G\u00farkhas, whilst forty Europeans arrived from Landour, and, with their assistance, the muharram was passed without any disturbance. The people of the towns were occasion-\nally able to do something to protect themselves, thus the Musalm\u00e1ns of Deoband made a gallant defence on two occasions against the K\u00e1tha insurgents, and the people of Kankhal repulsed the attacks of dakaits. Assistance was given to the Muzaffarnagar authorities in their attack upon Th\u00e1n\u00e1 Bhawan, where Mr. Lowe, C.S., was severely wounded; and after this the influence of the aid from the Amb\u00e1l\u00e1 District, the presence of the G\u00farkhas, and the energy displayed by the European officers, prevented any further real danger to the safety of the district. Still much uneasiness was caused by the raids of the rebels from Bijnaur, in one of which a police-station was burned, and some horses of the irregular cavalry were carried off. To prevent these raids, Colonel Baird Smith established a movable column, which did good service, and was fortunate enough to defeat a party of one thousand men who crossed at Mayapur below Kankhal, but were not allowed time to do any great mischief.\n\nMr. Spankie then commenced setting about the testing of re-measurements, in preparation for the ensuing settlement of the district; and in December, 1857, found himself able to move about the district with a slight personal guard. He writes\u2014\u201cThe people were civil and respectful. But in point of fact there can be no confidence placed in the demeanour or bearing of the people. They would always be respectful and submissive until it is in their power to be otherwise. The people of this district, and in all other parts of the country, I suppose, have no sympathy with Government, British or native. Separate castes and communities have separate ends and desires to attain, and the weakness of Government is their strength. Revenge and loot, in the first instance, led the agricultural communities astray. The burning of records, as in tahsil Nakf\u00fcr, was the crowning result of a determination to have no obligations towards any one. The common brotherhood of the Muhammedans is a different thing; and I think it would be impossible to deny that they were heart and soul against us. They had everything to gain and little to lose as a general rule. They were in arms against the excesses of the G\u00fajars simply because their own time had not come. These G\u00fajars and others were out for a temporary gain, and to make the best of the present. The moment they found their\u2019s a losing game, they stopped it; and they bow to the strong hand as long as it is strong. The Muhammedan population is ever against us.\u201d The kotwal of Sah\u00e1r\u00e1npur and the m\u00fanaf of Sh\u00e1mli (both Musalm\u00e1ns) were executed, and, on the whole, exceedingly severe and wholesome punishment was awarded, which, \u201cwith the eclipse of the Sudder Court,\u201d and thus the prevention of the escape of offenders by appeal to the higher courts, rendered the safety of the district secure. There was never much loss of the Government revenue, and agricultural operations went on much as usual; and though in the R\u00farki tahsil, the Rao\u00e9 (Musalm\u00e1ns)\nof Jaw\u00e1lapur and other Muhammadans came under grave suspicion, the disarmament of the inhabitants of Kankhal, Hardw\u00e1r and Jaw\u00e1lapur removed all cause for uneasiness. On the whole, the wild country in the south of the Jaw\u00e1lapur parganah, the kh\u00e1dirs of the great rivers, the tracts near the K\u00e1tha, and the villages lying amid the G\u00fajar colonies, suffered most; and the principal disturbers of the peace were the G\u00fajars, Musalm\u00e1n Rajp\u00fats, Pundir Rajp\u00fats of the K\u00e1tha, Banj\u00e1ras, and the low Musalm\u00e1n population of the towns. Since January, 1858, the district has returned to its normal state, and all matters pertaining to its history belong to the different heads under which the district notice has been distributed.\n\nA general sketch of the sanitary operations in this district is given in the introduction. Fever and small-pox are the principal diseases. Fever is especially rife, and belongs to that class known as malarious. Fever epidemics have periodically occurred all over this tract from time immemorial. Over-saturation of the soil combined with bad drainage, is the principal cause of the fever, but to this may be added the drainage of refuse water into the many excavations which are found around every village site, and the great heat that is always present. In 1871 a large amount of quinine was imported from England and a staff of four hospital assistants were sent to travel through the fever-stricken portions of the district and attend the sick at their homes. Over 5,000 cases were treated, but with what result is not known.\n\nThe following statement gives the mortuary statistics from 1867 to 1873:\n\n| Year | Fever | Small-pox | Bowel complaints | Cholera | Other causes | Total | Percentage of deaths to 1,000 of the population |\n|------|-------|-----------|-----------------|---------|--------------|-------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| 1867 | 5,655 | 1,186     | 781             | 887     | 4,845        | 13,459| 15\u00b75                                           |\n| 1868 | 7,210 | 3,174     | 792             | 138     | 4,886        | 16,500| 18\u00b76                                           |\n| 1869 | 11,189| 1,106     | 694             | 182     | 4,928        | 18,599| 21\u00b71                                           |\n| 1870 | 19,906| 1,977     |                 | 113     | 7,048        | 30,044| 38\u00b751                                          |\n| 1871 | 81,184| 4,441     | 9,355           | 164     | 1,712        | 39,886| 34\u00b746                                          |\n| 1872 | 14,839| 5,996     | 2,669           | 1,851   | 2,160        | 26,315| 29\u00b774                                          |\n| 1873 | 12,174| 8,811     | 2,187           | 45      | 3,891        | 21,058| 28\u00b781                                          |\nGAZETTEER\nOF THE\nSAH\u00c1RANPUR DISTRICT.\n\nCONTENTS.\n\n| Page | Page | Page |\n|------|------|------|\n| Ambahta | ... 256 | Jaw\u00e1lapur Parganah | ... 394 | Panj\u00e1la | ... 814 |\n| Ambahta Parganah | ... 259 | Kankhal | ... 267 | Pat\u00e9har Parganah | ... 315 |\n| Bah\u00e1t ditto | ... ib. | K\u00e1tha Parganah | ... ib. | R\u00e1jap\u00far | ... ib. |\n| Bhagw\u00e1npur | ... 260 | Kh\u00e9ri ditto | ... 292 | R\u00e1mpur | ... ib. |\n| Bhagw\u00e1npur Parganah | ... ib. | Kotwal | ... ib. | R\u00e1mper Parganah | ... 316 |\n| Chana\u00fat Kh\u00e9ri Parganah | ... 268 | Lakhnauti Parganah | ... ib. | R\u00far\u00edki | ... 319 |\n| Chilk\u00e1na | ... 264 | Lakhnauti | ... ib. | R\u00far\u00edki Parganah | ... 324 |\n| Deoband | ... ib. | Landhaura | ... 299 | R\u00far\u00edki Tahsil | ... 328 |\n| Deoband Parganah | ... 267 | Libarheri | ... ib. | Sah\u00e1r\u00e1npur | ... ib. |\n| Deoband Tahsil | ... 271 | Malhaipur Parganah | ... ib. | Sah\u00e1r\u00e1npur Parganah | ... 333 |\n| Dhul\u00e1gra jhil | ... ib. | M\u00e1n Singh-ke-T\u00e1oda | ... ib. | Sah\u00e1r\u00e1npur Tahsil | ... 336 |\n| Fais\u00e1b\u00e1d Parganah | ... 272 | Manglaur | ... 300 | Sakr\u00e1n\u00e1da | ... 337 |\n| Fatehpur | ... 275 | Manglaur Parganah | ... ib. | Sar\u00e1\u00edwa | ... ib. |\n| Gangoh | ... ib. | Maikara river | ... 303 | Sar\u00e1\u00edwa Parganah | ... ib. |\n| Gangoh Parganah | ... 277 | Musaff\u00e1rabad Parganah | ... ib. | Shalkhpura | ... 340 |\n| Harv\u00e1ra ditto | ... 281 | N\u00e1g\u00e1l | ... 307 | Sh\u00ednipuri | ... ib. |\n| Harv\u00e1ra | ... 283 | N\u00e1g\u00e1l Parganah | ... ib. | S\u00edk\u00e1nd\u00e1rpur | ... 341 |\n| Jal\u00e1mnagar | ... 292 | Nak\u00far | ... 309 | Sul\u00ed\u00e1npur | ... ib. |\n| Jabberh\u00e9ra | ... 293 | Nak\u00far Parganah | ... 310 | Sul\u00ed\u00e1npur Parganah | ... ib. |\n| Jah\u00e1ngirabad Parganah | ... 293 | Nak\u00far Tahsil | ... 313 | Th\u00e1na Bhaw\u00e1n Parganah | ... 344 |\n| Jam\u00e1lgarh | ... ib. | N\u00e1n\u00e1nta Parganah | ... 314 | T\u00edron | ... ib. |\n| J\u00e1nk\u00e1l Parganah | ... ib. | N\u00e1n\u00e1nta | ... ib. | |\n| Jaw\u00e1lapur | ... 293 | Noj\u00edli | ... ib. | |\n\nAMBAHTA, or Anbahtab, a town in parganah Nak\u00far of the Sah\u00e1ranpur district, is distant 16 miles south-west of the town of Sah\u00e1ranpur. The population in 1853 numbered 6,311 souls, and in 1865 was 6,336. In 1872 there were 6,039 inhabitants, of whom 2,767 were Hind\u00fas (1,298 females), and 3,272 were Musalm\u00e1ns (1,722 females). The town site contains 55 acres, giving 110 inha-\nbitants per square acre. Ambahta contains 16 muhallas or wards, amongst which the houses are distributed. There are many good brick-built houses in the town, and the bazar consists of a double roadway, with a centre line of poor-looking shops. The roadways are well made and well drained of late years, and are in places paved with bricks. Gardens and clumps of mango trees make the suburbs look well-wooded. The site as a whole is well raised, so that drainage flows easily away towards the south-east, and there are few places where excessive rainfall can accumulate. The soil is light and porous; water in the wells is good, and is found at a depth of twenty-four feet from the surface. The Pirzadah family of Sayyids of Ambahta are well known throughout this district. Their ancestors came from Makka some 300 years ago. Shah Abul Maali, a celebrated personage in the seventeenth century, and belonging to this family, is buried here. The family still hold several revenue-free grants, and one representative resides in the fort, and another near the Shah's tomb. The tomb is a fine domed building with minarets, all in good repair, and situated in the middle of the town. It is the object of a yearly visit to the devout Muhammadans of the district. Ambahta was originally a cantonment for Mughal troops, established by Firuz Shah; hence the place was known as Firuzabad. The present town is comparatively modern, and contains two masjids built in Humayun's reign. Act XX. of 1856 (the Chaukidari Act) is in force, and in 1873 supported a village police numbering 13 men, at an annual cost of Rs. 720, defrayed from a house-tax. A staff of 13 public sweepers is also entertained for conservancy purposes. The total income was Rs. 2,456, falling at Re. 0-6-3 per head of the population. Considerable attention to conservancy matters has been shown here of late years, and the only great sickness occurred in 1870, when 730 persons died from fever. The town possesses an outpost of police, a branch post-office, and a well-kept village school. The Musalmans of this town were suspected of exciting disturbances during the mutiny.\n\nAmbahta, an old parganah of the Saharanpur district, is mentioned in the Ain-i-Akbari. It has always been held free of revenue since the British occupation, and of late years has been included in parganah Nakur.\n\nBahat, an old parganah or fiscal sub-division of the Saharanpur district, known in Akbar's time as Bahat Kanjewar. In the time of Shahjah\u00e1n the name was changed to Sult\u00e1npur Bahat. The village of Kanjewar is now in Muzaffarabad. Bahat and Sult\u00e1npur became separate parganahs under the Rohillas in the last century, and remained separate up to 1842, when several changes took place. The land revenue of Bahat, as it stood in 1840-41, was Rs. 35,556, and of this Rs. 3,639 were transferred, and Rs. 8,976 received in exchange, leaving the revenue at Rs. 40,893. In 1855 the changes made resulted in the absorption of Bahat amongst the neighbouring parganahs. It then contained 91 villages, with an area of 64,918 acres, a land revenue of\nRs. 46,222, and a population numbering 33,980 souls. These were distributed as follows:\n\n| To parganah | Number of villages | Area in acres | Revenue | Population |\n|-------------|--------------------|---------------|---------|------------|\n| Falzabad    | 25                 | 14,931        | 14,168  | 10,598     |\n| Muzaffarabad | 57                | 44,251        | 25,557  | 19,545     |\n| Saharanpur   | 7                  | 4,732         | 5,466   | 3,318      |\n| **Total**    |                    |               |         |            |\n\n**Bhagwanpur**, the chief town of the parganah of the same name in the Saharanpur district, is distant 18 miles from Saharanpur and 6\u00bd miles north-west from R\u00fcrki, on the Saharanpur and R\u00fcrki road. The population in 1872 numbered 2,412 souls. Bhagwanpur is said to have been founded in 1118 sanvat (1061 A.D.) by a colony of Rajputs and Brahmins. It has a second class police-station, a branch post-office, and a village school. Act XX. of 1856 (the Chaukidari Act) is in force, and in 1873 supported a force of eight men, at an annual cost of Rs. 432, defrayed from a house-tax. The total income for 1872-73 amounted to Rs. 1,118, giving an incidence of Re. 0-7-4 per head of the population and Rs. 2-2-0 per house. Bhagwanpur, though the head of a parganah, is merely a small agricultural village, without any trade or manufacture, and only a good sized market to supply the local wants.\n\n**Bhagwanpur**, a parganah in tahsil R\u00fcrki of the Saharanpur district, is bounded on the north by the Siwalik (Shiwalak) hills; on the west by parganahs Haraura, Nagal and Muzaffarabad; on the east by parganah R\u00fcrki; and on the south by parganah Manglaur. According to the census of 1872, parganah Bhagwanpur had a total area of 244 square miles, of which 95 square miles were under cultivation. The area assessed to Government revenue during the same year was 147 square miles, of which 95 square miles were cultivated, 36 square miles were culturable, and 16 square miles were barren. This parganah naturally divides into four tracts. The first tract comprises the villages in the southern uplands owned by a mixed proprietary of G\u00fajars, G\u00e1ras, Tagas, Mah\u00e1jans, Brahmins, Rajputs, &c. It is, on the whole, tolerably level, and includes the sources of the K\u00e1li Nadi, with less inferior land and less bh\u00e9dha soil than in the corresponding tract in the adjoining parganah of Nagal. Water is found at a depth of about eleven feet from the surface; but, owing to the quicksand in the sub-soil, earthen wells are for the most part impracticable. The people, from over-assessment under the old settlement, could not afford to construct brick-built wells, hence there is\nbut little irrigation, and even, in places, an insufficiency of water for domestic purposes. The sub-soil is retentive of moisture, and if this were not the case, large tracts must remain uncultivated in seasons of drought. The people here suffered much during the famine of 1860. The second tract includes the villages having mixed uplands and lowlands. The villages immediately on the bank of the Sol\u00e1ni are very poor, and constantly exposed to diluvion by inundation. Those further north grow good kharif corps and sugar-cane. Here the lands of a few villages on the bank above are poor, but the surface almost at once begins to slope towards the head of the K\u00e1l\u00ed river, and the soil there is very good. Water is 23 feet from the surface, but earthen wells only last a year and a half, so that irrigation is scanty.\n\nThe lowland villages occupying the valley of the Sol\u00e1ni, between Kheri and Sakrauda on the north and the highlands on the south, form the third tract. The valley is narrow towards the north, but opens up towards the south-east. The soil to the north consists of a rich loam, which changes into a rich clay to the south-east; both are good and productive, but the agricultural condition of the several villages varies very much. From Fatehullahpur, near the Mohand Pass, down to Sodiw\u00e1la, opposite Kheri, the cultivation is scanty, and interspersed amid patches of grass jungle. The R\u00e1ngar proprietors reside in a mass at Kheri. They formerly owned a large extent of land in this parganah, but owing to their indolence and jealousies many villages were taken from them in 1836, and settled with the resident cultivators. Since then the R\u00e1ngars have lost much more by private and public sale. On the south-east, where the Sakrauda R\u00e1ngars are the proprietors, the villages are better off, though the R\u00e1ngars, as a rule, make hard and exacting landlords. The Powell family, also, have some villages here. In the north, spring crops form the staple; in the centre, autumn crops; and to the south, rice. Irrigation is nowhere necessary. The last tract includes the lands lying on the plateau of Kheri and Sakrauda, which consists of an infinity of mounds and hillocks, separated from each other by ravines with sloping sides covered with brush-wood. On the Kheri side there is some fair timber, but towards Sakrauda the carissa (karaunda) prevails. Mr. Powell reclaimed and brought under cultivation the uplands of two villages, but on the whole there is much waste here. Water is as deep as 36 to 38 feet from the surface, but this is partially counterbalanced by the abundant rain-fall, which gives good b\u00e1jra and jod\u00e1r crops, and in the small kh\u00e1dir patches wheat is grown.\n\nThe last year of Mr. E. Thornton's settlement gave a land revenue amounting to Rs. 81,456; this was increased by Mr. Vans-Agnew to Rs. 82,063; and Mr. Wynne, on revising the proceedings of Mr. Vans-Agnew, proposed a land revenue of Rs. 81,863 on an area then comprising 81,678 acres, of which 71,249 acres were assessed.\nto the land revenue, and of these 52,875 acres were under cultivation. The actual land revenue for 1872 amounted to Rs. 79,653 (or with cesses, Rs. 87,598), falling at a rate of Rs. 0-8-2 per British acre on the total area; at Rs. 0-13-7 per acre on the area assessed to Government revenue; and at Rs. 1-5-0 per acre on the cultivated area. The sum paid by cultivators to the landowners as rent and cesses during the same year has been estimated at Rs. 1,26,659.\n\nBetween the years 1839-40 and 1859-60, five whole villages and 60 portions of villages, having an area of 8,217 acres, and paying a revenue of Rs. 9,332, and valued at Rs. 52,752, were transferred by private arrangement in this parganah. The transfers by decree of Court comprised one entire village and 61 portions of villages, having an aggregate area of 7,687 acres, and paying a revenue of Rs. 8,196. The value recorded was Rs. 28,495. Out of the 33 whole and 77 portions of villages remaining with the original proprietors, 1,465 acres, bearing a revenue of Rs. 856, valued at Rs. 6,226, of the former, and 4,776 acres, bearing a revenue of Rs. 4,971, valued at Rs. 34,234, of the latter, were under mortgage. These statistics give a percentage of private transfers to the total area of ten per cent., of transfers by decree of Court amounting to nine per cent., and of transfers by mortgage amounting to eight per cent. The average value per acre in each of these cases was Rs. 6-6-8, Rs. 3-11-3, and Rs. 6-7-0, and the land revenue assessed amounted to Re. 1-2-2, Re. 1-1, and Re. 0-15 per acre respectively. The result from the entire parganah on 27 per cent. of the total area, gives an average value of Rs. 5-8-0 per acre, when the average land revenue amounted to Rs. 1-1 per acre. G\u00fajars lost three whole villages, and Shaikhs, Path\u00e1ns and Rajp\u00fats lost one each.\n\nAccording to the census of 1872 parganah Bhagw\u00e1npur contained 143 inhabited villages, of which 62 had less than 200 inhabitants; 37 had between 200 and 500; 26 had between 500 and 1,000; 15 had between 1,000 and 2,000; three had between 2,000 and 3,000. The records show that there were 131 estates at settlement, of which fourteen were jungle grants. The total population in 1872 numbered 63,770 souls (28,778 females); giving 261 to the square mile. Classified according to religion, there were 42,074 Hind\u00fas, of whom 18,790 were females; and 21,696 Musalm\u00e1ns, amongst whom 9,988 were females. Distributing the Hindu population amongst the four great classes, the census shows 2,667 Brahmans, of whom 1,257 were females; 900 Rajp\u00fats, including 377 females; 1,839 Baniyas (815 females); whilst the great mass of the population is included in \u201cthe other castes\u201d of the census returns, which show a total of 36,668 souls, of whom 16,341 are females. The principal Brahman subdivisions found in this parganah are the Gaur (2,452) and Ach\u00e1raj. The Rajp\u00fats belong to the\nPundir, Khagi and Maudhar clans, and the Baniyas to the Agarwali (1,099), and Sarangi subdivisions. The other castes containing more than one thousand members are the Kahar (2,507), Cham\u00e1r (13,166), Kh\u00e1krob (1,442), G\u00fajar (2,901), Barhai (1,177), Sai\u00fai (4,291), Taga (1,892), and Banj\u00e1ra (1,679). The Musalm\u00e1ns are distributed amongst Shaikhs (607), converted Pundirs (107), converted Chauh\u00e1ns (49), other converted Rajputs (1,483), and Path\u00e1ns (271); the remainder are entered without distinction. The principal land-holders are Musalm\u00e1n R\u00e1ngars and Mah\u00e1jans in the north, and those already mentioned in the first tract on the south.\n\nThe occupations of the people are shown in the statistics collected at the census of 1872. From these it appears that of the male adult population (not less than fifteen years of age) 536 are employed in professional avocations, such as Government servants, priests, doctors, and the like; 2,244 in domestic service, as personal servants, water-carriers, barbers, sweepers, washermen, &c.; 1,019 in commerce, in buying, selling, keeping or lending money or goods, or the conveyance of men, animals, or goods; 8,601 in agricultural operations; 3,257 in industrial occupations, arts and mechanics, and the preparation of all classes of substances, vegetable, mineral, and animal. There were 4,832 persons returned as labourers, and 727 as of no specified occupation. Taking the total population, irrespective of age or sex, the same returns give 742 as landholders, 23,034 as cultivators, and 40,004 as engaged in occupations unconnected with agriculture. The educational statistics, which are confessedly imperfect, show 270 males as able to read and write out of a total male population numbering 34,992 souls.\n\nBhagw\u00e1npur was formed in 1855, by Messrs. Craigie and Ross, from the parganahs mentioned below:\n\n| Parganah | Villages | Area in acres | Revenue | Population |\n|----------|----------|---------------|---------|------------|\n| R\u00f3rk\u00ed    | 69       | 48,308        | 56,803  | 35,066     |\n| Manglaur | 19       | 4,754         | 9,715   | 4,601      |\n| Musaffarahad | 17 | 18,274        | 7,490   | 6,939      |\n| Jaur\u00e1si  | 22       | 25,624        | 9,461   | 5,868      |\n| Deoband  | 1        | 110           | 200     | 113        |\n| Total    | 128      | 93,970        | 85,669  | 59,061     |\n\nChaurat Kheri, or Chaunsat Kheri, an old parganah of the Saharanpur district, consisted of villages scattered amongst parganahs Th\u00e1n\u00e1 Bhawan, Gangoh and N\u00e1nauta, and was absorbed amongst them in 1842. It then gave a land revenue of Rs. 20,579 per annum. Fourteen of the villages were at the\nsame time transferred to the Muzaffarnagar district, and divided amongst the parganahs of Jhanjh\u00e1na, Charth\u00e1wal, Bidauli, Kair\u00e1ns and Th\u00e1n\u00e1 Bhawan.\n\nChilk\u00e1na, a town in parganah Sult\u00e1npur of the Sah\u00e1ranpur district, is distant nine miles north-west from Sah\u00e1ranpur. The population in 1872 numbered 4,026 souls. Chilk\u00e1na is situated on the road between Sah\u00e1ranpur and Umballa (Amb\u00e1l\u00e1), and possesses a second class police-station and a post-office. The principal inhabitants are some decayed families of Sayyids. The town is united with Sult\u00e1npur for the purposes of the Chaukid\u00e1ri Act (XX. of 1856), and together they support a force of 16 men, at an annual cost of Rs. 882. The income from all sources during 1872-73 was Rs. 3,398, giving an incidence of Re. 0-7-1 per head of the population, and Re. 1-12-3 per house. During the same year one-third of the income was expended in drainage cuts and repairs to roads. From its position on the old high road to the Panj\u00e1b, Chilk\u00e1na is of some strategical importance as a military post and under the Marhattas was held by the troops of the Begam Sumru. In 1857 it was occupied by a body of plundering G\u00fajars, who were dispersed by the arrival of a force from Jag\u00e9dri.\n\nDeoband, the chief town of the parganah of the same name in the Sah\u00e1ranpur district, is distant 21 miles south from Sah\u00e1ranpur.\n\nPopulation.\n\n| Latitude | Longitude |\n|----------|-----------|\n| 29\u00b0 41' 50\" | 77\u00b0 43' 10\" |\n\nThe population in 1847 was 11,634; in 1853 there were 18,638 inhabitants; and in 1865, 21,714. In 1872, out of a total population numbering 19,168 souls, 8,614 were Hind\u00fas (4,026 females); 10,554 were Musalm\u00e1ns (5,059 females); and there was one Christian. Distributing the population amongst the urban and rural classes proper, there were 166 landholders, 2,047 cultivators, and 16,965 persons unconnected with agriculture. The number of enclosures in 1872 was 1,730, of which 688 were occupied by Hind\u00fas and 1,042 by Musalm\u00e1ns. The number of houses in the same year was 4,079, of which 1,264 were built with skilled labour, and of these 725 were inhabited by Hind\u00fas and 539 by Musalm\u00e1ns. Of the 2,815 mud huts in the town, 1,137 were possessed by Hind\u00fas and 1,678 by Musalm\u00e1ns. The area of the town site is 193 acres, giving 99 inhabitants to the acre. Taking the male adult population (not less than fifteen years of age), we find the following occupations pursued by more than fifty males:\u2014Barbers 138; boggars, 209; bricklayers, 54; calico-printers, 65; cultivators, 716; labourers, 1,223; landowners, 63; merchants, 311; money-lenders, 112; oil-makers, 227; parohits, 201; servants, 749; shop-keepers, 775; sweepers, 67; tailors, 55; water-carriers, 128; and weavers, 820.\n\nThe site lies about two and a half miles to the west of the East K\u00e1li N\u00e1di, with which it was formerly connected by a wide natural water-way or depression known as the Jor, which runs from the south of the town eastwards. About half a mile from the town, the Jor\nspreads out into a tank-like expanse, known as the Devikund, the west and north banks of which are covered with temples, ghats and numerous sati monuments, much frequented by pilgrims. There are numerous water-holes, for the flood-water of which there is no outlet and consequently there is much flooding during the rains. A scheme for draining the outskirts is now under consideration. There are four bazars\u2014the Chota, Bara, Sathattar and Bahra\u2014all of which appear to be prosperous and cleanly, except the last, which contains many ruinous houses and open places used as receptacles for refuse. There are no metalled road-ways, except that leading to the railway-station, but the bazar roads are well made of earth, with side drains; the smaller ways, too, have been much improved of late years. The water in the principal well stood at 35 feet from the surface in March, the average depth being 27 feet. The people say that the average spring level has risen from 34 feet since the introduction of the canal, though there is no canal irrigation nearer than eight miles. The water in some wells has a good sweet taste, but in others is brackish. On the whole, the site is well raised, and has good drainage towards the south, and little remains to be done in the way of sanitation beyond the utilization of existing means and the enforcement of cleanliness.\n\nThe Musalmans here are numerous and influential and are owners of the town site, in which there are now about 1,800 sharers. All these men prefer to live on the miserable pittance they receive than to follow any occupation. There are 42 masjids in the town, and a good private school, where 180 boys are taught the Koran, and Arabic and Persian. Amongst these, forty poor scholars are supported by the Muhammadan residents. Deoband is, however, essentially a Hindu town, and has an antiquity which may extend to 3,000 years. It is said that the Pandavas resided here during their first exile, and the Musalmans assert that it was one of the first fortresses taken by the celebrated hero Sipah Salar Masaf Ghazi. Its original name was Deviban or the \"sacred forest,\" and there is still a grove near the city in which there is a temple to Devi, where a religious assembly is held yearly in the month of Chait. Deoband lies on the military route from Meerut to Landour. It is 15\u00bd miles from the previous stage (Muzaffarnagar), and 11\u00bd miles from the next stage (Nagal). The encamping-ground here is good. The road from Muzaffarnagar is metalled for five miles, afterwards heavy; you leave the road to Rurki (distant 28 miles) at four miles, and cross the Kali Nadi by a bridge at five miles. From Deoband to Nagal the road is rather heavy, and passes Saisana at 7\u00bd miles, and Barsora at 9\u00bd miles (see Nagal, Muzaffarnagar). Deoband possesses a good dispensary, Anglo-vernaular school, a first class police-station, a tahsili and a post-office. The municipality is managed by a committee of 15 members, of whom four hold office ex-officio, three are nominated by the executive authority, and eight are elected by the tax-\npayers. The following statements give the income and expenditure for a series of years, and at the same time indicate the character of the local trade and the incidence of taxation. In 1872-73 taxation fell at 8\u00bd annas per head of the population per annum:\n\n**Statement showing Receipts and Expenditure of the Deoband Municipality for the years 1868-69 to 1872-73.**\n\n| Receipts | 1868-69 | 1869-70 | 1870-71 | 1871-72 | 1872-73 |\n|----------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Opening Balance | ... | ... | ... | 738 | ... |\n| I.\u2014Food and drink | 2,607 | 1,532 | 3,288 | ... | ... |\n| II.\u2014Animals | 10 | 84 | 48 | ... | ... |\n| III.\u2014Fuels &c. | 319 | 209 | 288 | ... | ... |\n| IV.\u2014Building materials | 101 | 136 | 303 | ... | ... |\n| V.\u2014Drugs, spices | 193 | 311 | 250 | ... | ... |\n| VI.\u2014Tobacco | 135 | 127 | 196 | ... | ... |\n| VII.\u2014Textile fabrics | 131 | 1,246 | 954 | ... | ... |\n| VIII.\u2014Metals | 49 | 127 | 162 | ... | ... |\n| Total of Octroi | 2,759 | 5,801 | 3,440 | 4,050 | 5,567 |\n| Miscellaneous | 56 | 896 | 1,937 | 3,254 | 4,806 |\n| Total | 2,815 | 6,697 | 5,377 | 6,874 | 11,211 |\n\n| Expenditure | 1868-69 | 1869-70 | 1870-71 | 1871-72 | 1872-73 |\n|-------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Collection | 750 | 2,343 | 1,068 | 1,239 | 1,461 |\n| Head-office | ... | ... | ... | ... | 78 |\n| Original works | 104 | ... | ... | ... | ... |\n| Supervision | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |\n| Repairs, &c. | 137 | 601 | 151 | 306 | 487 |\n| Police | 1,516 | 3,636 | 3,044 | 3,138 | 3,176 |\n| Education | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |\n| Conservancy Charitable grants | 163 | ... | 1,123 | 974 | 1,298 |\n| Repayment of loans | ... | ... | ... | 186 | 448 |\n| Road watering | ... | ... | ... | ... | 20 |\n| Other Items | 147 | 140 | 262 | 37 | 107 |\n| Total | 2,815 | 6,681 | 6,825 | 6,305 | 9,065 |\n\nThe following statement shows the quantity or value of the principal imports in 1872-73, with the estimated consumption per head of the population:\n\n| Articles | Weight in maunds | Value | Mr. Johnston's estimate of actual consumption per head | Actual incidence of dutiable articles in 1872-73 | Actual incidence of dutiable articles in 1873-74 |\n|----------|------------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| Grain and flour | 54,720 | Rs. 89,102 | Mds. a. p. 6 0 0 | Rs. a. p. 4 1 3 | Rs. a. p. 4 9 5 | Mds. a. p. 2 33 0 |\n| Sugar (khaad) | 361 | Rs. 4,679 | 0 2 1 | 0 3 9 | 0 0 12 |\n| Coarse sugar | 1,441 | Rs. 30,315 | 0 11 8 | 0 4 4 | 1 9 0 | 0 2 15 |\n| G\u00fcr | 216 | Rs. 918 | 0 8 0 | 0 0 9 | 0 0 7 |\n| Shira | 146 | Rs. 335 | 0 0 1 | 0 0 3 | 0 0 4 |\n| Gh\u00ed | 443 | Rs. 10,423 | 0 3 0 | 0 9 1 | 0 8 7 | 0 0 14 |\n| Oil | 58 | Rs. 585 | 0 4 0 | 0 0 5 | 0 0 5 | 0 0 2 |\n| Oil seeds | 8,691 | Rs. 14,387 | 0 12 0 | 0 11 10 | 0 7 9 |\n| Tobacco | 1,584 | Rs. 5,672 | 0 10 0 | 0 5 2 | 0 4 10 | 0 8 2 |\n| Drugs and spices | 10,688 | Rs. 12 0 | 0 11 4 | 0 8 10 | 0 1 13 |\n| European and native cloth | 60,890 | 5 0 0 | 4 2 5 | 3 4 3 |\n| Other cloth | 2,458 | 1 0 0 | 0 6 10 | 0 14 7 | 0 0 9 |\n| Metals | 295 | Rs. 17,709 | 0 10 0 | 0 14 7 | 0 0 9 |\nIn compiling his estimate, Mr. Jenkinson divided the population into three classes: the first class, comprising 3,000 members, were well off; the second class had an equal number; and the third, or poor, numbered 13,000. From local inquiry he ascertained the consumption and expenditure of each class, and from the totals of the three classes struck averages per head for the whole population. Deoband is a poor town, and in framing the rates of consumption, cannot be compared with Saharanpur; accordingly the estimate is below the average of these Provinces, and the actual averages show that there must be an immense amount of smuggling. The revenue from the octroi in 1873-74 amounted to over Rs. 12,000, which will admit of the abolition of the existing house-tax. The only export of grain is to the neighbouring villages. Refined sugar and oil are exported, and a fine species of g\u00e1rd cloth is manufactured, to the value of about Rs. 26,000.\n\nEarly in May, 1857, the villagers in the neighbourhood of Deoband attacked the town and plundered portions of it. Mr. H. D. Robertson, with a small force, proceeded to Deoband, and, after some resistance, succeeded in capturing and burning the villages of B\u00e1bupur, Fatehpur and Sampla Bak\u00e1l, which had harboured and joined with a party of dakaits in plundering along the high road. Again, in August, the town was attacked by a number of dakaits, assisted by the inhabitants of certain villages in the neighbourhood of P\u00far in the Muzaffarnagar district, who succeeded in plundering the quarters inhabited by the Mah\u00e1jans and Baniyas. The attack had been systematically conducted; certain villages confining their operations to certain quarters, but the resistance was equally determined. The quarters inhabited by the Cham\u00e1rs, G\u00fajars, and Musalm\u00e1ns were untouched, though on the outskirts and undefended, and \"it might be suspected that these parties had some interest in the attack.\" The villages of Chota Sampla, Sal\u00e1hpur, Banhera, Dukhch\u00e1ra and M\u00e1nki were punished for their complicity in this attack. Several parties of G\u00fajars, discovered with plunder in their possession, were seized and punished, and this, with the exemplary defeat bestowed upon the Banj\u00e1ras to the north, succeeded in freeing the town from any further alarm during the remainder of the disturbances.\n\nDEOBAND, a parganah of tahsil Deoband in the Saharanpur district, is bounded on the west by the R\u00e1mpur parganah; on the east by Manglaur and the Muzaffarnagar district; on the north by Manglaur and N\u00e1g\u00e1l; and on the south by the Muzaffarnagar district. According to the census of 1872, this parganah had then a total area of 136 square miles, of which 114 square miles were under cultivation. The area assessed to Government revenue during the same year was 129 square miles, of which 110 square miles were cultivated, 8 square miles were culturable, and 11 square miles were barren. The parganah consists of a tract west of the Hindan,\na large and high plateau between it and the K\u00e1li N\u00e1di, the du\u00e1b between the two heads of the K\u00e1li N\u00e1di, and a narrow strip east of that stream. The first tract comprises a portion of the old K\u00e1t.ia parganah, and is inhabited by the same clan of Pundir Rajputs that is found in the remainder of the K\u00e1tha now included in R\u00e1mpur. It is drained by the depression that first gives birth to a rivulet at Umri, in the R\u00e1mpur parganah, and thence runs southwards through this group of villages. The soil is good, and yields good crops of kusum (safflower) and wheat. The villages lying on either side of the Hindan are also owned by Pundir Rajputs of the K\u00e1tha. The higher lands here are poor and sandy, especially along the left bank, whilst those in the kh\u00e1dir, though better, are inferior to lands similarly situated in N\u00e1g\u00e1l. No less than twenty-seven per cent. of the cultivated area is bh\u00fada, or soil of the very worst description, and only eight and-a-half per cent. was irrigated at settlement. The subsoil is bad; earthen wells seldom last more than two seasons, and are nearly all situated in the kh\u00e1dir. In the uplands the water is found at a depth of twenty feet from the surface.\n\nThe villages on the high central plateau between the Hindan and the K\u00e1li possess a light soil, which is fertile when irrigated, but there is little irrigation. Though the water is only twenty feet from the surface, there are few earthen wells or traces of them. On the west, just above the K\u00e1li N\u00e1di and near the bed of the stream, there is a strip of the worst soil, bh\u00fada. The population is very thin, and there is little chance of canal irrigation being extended to this tract, so that it must always remain somewhat backward. The villages about Deoband, comprising an area of about 7,600 acres, are very prosperous, with a good rich soil and a fair amount of irrigation. The last group contains the villages lying between the K\u00e1li and the Sil\u00e1 and a strip of land to the east of the latter. Near the banks of these streams the soil is a very low bh\u00fada of the worst description, and the surface is so uneven that no moisture remains. Further inland the surface is quite level and the soil is good. Where irrigated by the canal, excellent crops of sugar-cane and wheat are produced. The water in the centre of this tract is seldom less than twenty-one feet from the surface. The principal landholders are cultivating communities of G\u00e1rs and Tages.\n\nThe last year of the old settlement effected by Mr. E. Thornton showed a land revenue amounting to Rs. 1,01,679. This was increased to Rs. 1,02,827 by Mr. VansAgnew, and Mr. Wynne, on revising the settlement, fixed the assessment at Rs. 1,03,018, on a total area of 82,012 acres, of which 73,457 acres were assessed to Government revenue; and of these, 67,222 acres were actually under cultivation at the time of settlement. The land revenue for 1872 amounted to Rs. 94,452 (or with cesses, Rs. 1,04,527), falling at a rate of Re. 1-1-4 per British acre on the total area; at Re. 1-2-4 per acre on the area assessed to Government\nrevenue; and at Re. 1-4-9 per acre on the cultivated area. The sum paid by cultivators to the landowners as rent and cesses during the same year has been estimated at Rs. 1,49,853.\n\nBetween the years 1839-40 and 1859-60, two whole villages and 38 portions of villages, having an area of 3,235 acres, and paying a revenue of Rs. 5,308, and valued at Rs. 37,850, were transferred by private arrangement in this parganah. The transfers by decree of Court comprised one entire village and 72 portions of villages, having an aggregate area of 4,595 acres, and paying a revenue of Rs. 7,007. The value recorded was Rs. 24,672. Out of the 25 whole and 89 portions of villages remaining with the original proprietors, 209 acres, bearing a revenue of Rs. 340, valued at Rs. 2,925, of the former, and 2,504 acres, bearing a revenue of Rs. 3,483, valued at Rs. 21,845, of the latter, were under mortgage. These statistics give a percentage of private transfers to the total area of four per cent., of transfers by decree of Court amounting to five per cent., and of transfers by mortgage amounting to three per cent. The average value per acre in each of these cases was Rs. 11-11-0, Rs. 5-6-0 and Rs. 9-2-0, and the land revenue assessed amounted to Re. 1-10-3, Re. 1-8-0, and Re. 1-6-0 per acre, respectively. The result from the entire parganah on twelve per cent. of the total area gives an average value of Rs. 8-4-0 per acre when the average land revenue amounted to Re. 1-8 per acre. The principal losers were Hindu Rajputs, Tagas and Gujars.\n\nAccording to the census of 1872, parganah Deoband contained 85 inhabited villages, of which 20 had less than 200 inhabitants; 29 had between 200 and 500; 20 had between 500 and 1,000; 12 had between 1,000 and 2,000; and three had between 2,000 and 3,000. The only town containing more than 5,000 inhabitants is Deoband. The settlement records show that there are 124 estates in the parganah, of which nine are held free of revenue in perpetuity. The total population in 1872 numbered 69,430 souls (30,458 females), giving 511 to the square mile. Classified according to religion, there were 47,598 Hindus, of whom 20,183 were females; 21,831 Musalmans, amongst whom 10,275 were females; and there was one Christian. Distributing the Hindu population amongst the four great classes, the census shows 4,212 Brahmans, of whom 1,887 were females; 8,244 Rajputs, including 2,938 females; 3,016 Banias (1,360 females); whilst the great mass of the population is included in \"the other castes\" of the census returns, which shows a total of 32,121 souls, of whom 13,998 are females.\n\nThe principal Brahman subdivisions found in this parganah are the Gaur (3,568), Achhraj, Sanadh and Dakaut. The Rajputs belong to the Pundir (7,271), Khagi (261), Gahlot, Naruliya, Gaur and Jaiswar clans. The Banias are chiefly Agarwals (2,890) and Gatas. The other castes are for the most\npart the same as those noticed under the R\u00e1mpur parganah. The following show more than one thousand members:\u2014Kumbh\u00e1s (1,015), Kah\u00e1s (2,996), Cham\u00e1s (8,537), Kh\u00e1krobs (2,202), G\u00fajars (1,678), Barhais (1,311), and Sain\u00eds (2,213). The Musalm\u00e1ns are very numerous, and have been classified under Shaikhs (2,347), converted Pundirs (479), Chauh\u00e1ns and other Rajp\u00fats (589), and Path\u00e1ns (1,400); the remainder have been entered without distinction. The principal landholders are Tagas, both Musalm\u00e1n and Hindu; Mah\u00e1jans; G\u00e1ris; Rajp\u00fats, both Musalm\u00e1n and Hindu; Musalm\u00e1n G\u00fajars, and Shaikhs.\n\nThe occupations of the people are shown in the statistics collected at the census of 1872. From these it appears that of the male adult population (not less than fifteen years of age) 726 are employed in professional avocations, such as Government servants, priests, doctors, and the like; 3,425 in domestic service, as personal servants, water-carriers, barbers, sweepers, washermen, &c.; 1,761 in commerce, in buying, selling, keeping or lending money or goods, or the conveyance of men, animals, or goods; 10,691 in agricultural operations; 3,921 in industrial occupations, arts and mechanics, and the preparation of all classes of substances, vegetable, mineral, and animal. There were 3,332 persons returned as labourers and 661 as of no specified occupation. Taking the total population, irrespective of age or sex, the same returns give 13,544 as landholders, 12,578 as cultivators, and 43,308 as engaged in occupations unconnected with agriculture. The educational statistics, which are confessedly imperfect, show 158 males as able to read and write out of a total male population numbering 38,972 souls.\n\nDeoband is one of the old Akbari parganahs, and was the head of a dast\u00e1r, from which the K\u00e1tha parganah was separated in the time of Naj\u00edb Kh\u00e1n. The highest land revenue of the last year of the settlement previous to that made under Regulation VII. of 1822, amounted to Rs. 1,54,576. In 1841-42 it lost Rs. 28,157 by transfers, and gained Rs. 34,205, leaving the land revenue at Rs. 1,72,038. Eleven villages were transferred to the neighbouring district of Muzaffarnagar, and four villages were received in exchange. In 1855 extensive transfers again took place which are shown in the following table:\n\n| Parganah | Villages | Area | Land rev. | Population |\n|----------|----------|------|-----------|------------|\n| Transferred to | N\u00e1g\u00e1l | 118 | 72,365 | 94,069 | 48,713 |\n| | R\u00e1mpur | 1 | 803 | 865 | 311 |\n| | Haraura | 21 | 11,534 | 14,500 | 8,107 |\n| | Manglaur | 2 | 765 | 785 | 226 |\n| | Bhagw\u00e1npur | 1 | 110 | 90 | 118 |\n\n| Received from | K\u00e1tha | 20 | 21,349 | 24,280 | 15,543 |\n| | R\u00e1mpur | 8 | 1,583 | 8,070 | 1,269 |\n| | Balance remaining. | 121 | 87,889 | 1,00,199 | 68,583 |\nDeoband, a tahsil in the Saharanpur district, comprises the parganahs of Deoband, Rampur, and Nagal. The total area, according to the census of 1872, is 387 square miles, of which 314 square miles are cultivated. The area assessed to Government revenue is given at 374 square miles, of which 307 square miles are cultivated, 84 square miles are culturable, and 33 square miles are barren. The land revenue during the same year stood at Rs. 3,02,057 (or with cesses, Rs. 3,33,563), falling at Re. 1-3-6 per acre on the total area, Re. 1-4-2 per acre on the area assessed to Government revenue, and Re. 1-8-1 on the cultivated area. The population numbered 198,692 souls (88,335 females), giving 513 to the square mile, distributed amongst 310 villages. The same statistics show 35 persons blind and one leper in the tahsil. This tahsil stretches along the border of the Muzaffarnagar district, and may be described as a series of duabs between the Katha, the Krishni, the Hindan and the different heads of the West Kali Nadi. All other matters connected with this tahsil will be found under the district notice, or separately under each parganah.\n\nDhulapra Jhil is a natural reservoir of water in parganah Sarsawa of the Saharanpur district. In connection with the drainage arrangements of the Eastern Jumna Canal, a cut was made between the Kumbhhera jhil and the Dhulapra jhil for the purposes of drainage. This cut starts from the right bank of the canal, within a few yards of the Jaroli bridge. The alignment has a direction generally a few degrees north of west. After passing the Jaroli rajbaha at the 80th chain, the cut enters the Kumbhhera jhil (chain 110), and follows the jhil for about 50 chains. It then crosses the Pilkhani (chain 210) rajbaha, and enters the Dhulapra jhil (chain 290). It runs down the jhil for about 20 chains, and enters the khadir under the village of Agwahera (chain 410), and tails into the Sarsawa Nadi (chain 560) after a course of a little under 104 miles. From its entrance into the Kumbhhera jhil to its exit from the Dhulapra jhil, the cut runs through low lands, the cutting seldom exceeding 2-5 feet. Beyond the latter jhil to its descent into the low lands, the cutting is deep, averaging eight feet.\n\nThis extensive work cost Rs. 32,500, but up to the end of 1873 only about 272 bighas of land could be put down as the net results of the reclamation attempted, whilst complaints were made of flooding in Abdullahpur and others of the neighbouring villages. The natural course of the drainage lines from both these jhilis is to the Katha and Saindli Nadis, but instead of this course having been adopted, the cut was led across country at right angles to the natural line. Many proposals have been made to remedy this grave mistake. Until the new works are completed on the Katha, it is impossible to use it as an escape, otherwise the swamps already existing would become so difficult to manage that greater evils than those already existing would arise. The final arrangement agreed upon seems to be the deepening of the cut. As originally designed, the cut had a\nbed slope of $\\frac{1}{560}$, and a bottom width of eighteen feet, whilst a surplus slope of 7.5 feet was overcome by three masonry falls. By increasing the bed slope it is proposed to do away with the falls, and thus lower the bed of the cut in the Dhulapra jhil by two feet, and give a flood-level so much lower. The velocity, too, due to the increased slope, will have the effect of running off the water more rapidly; but it has yet to be seen whether this increased power of drainage has been so arranged as not to act injuriously to the village lands in the lower portion of its course. Owing to the grave faults of the plan originally adopted, the Dhulapra cut has not been of much use either as a drainage line or as a reclamation work, and it will take much time, trouble, and money before it can be fitted even for the ordinary purposes of a drainage work.\n\n**Faizabad**, or Faizabad Bahat, a parganah of tahsil Saharanpur, is bounded on the north by the Siwaliks; on the west by the Jumna, which separates it from the Ambala district of the Panjab; on the south by parganah Sultanpur; and on the east by parganah Muzaffarabad. According to the census of 1872 parganah Faizabad had a total area of 182 square miles, of which 71 square miles were under cultivation. The area assessed to Government revenue during the same year was 118 square miles, of which 71 square miles were cultivated, 27 square miles were culturable, and 20 square miles were barren. The area of this parganah may be divided into three tracts,\u2014the one bordering on the hills, where owing to the difficulty of procuring water even for domestic purposes, and the destruction caused by wild elephants and deer, as well as the danger to houses by fire, as only thatched roofs are practicable, the population is very scanty; secondly, the highlands lying at a distance from the hills; and thirdly, the villages of the Jumna khadir. The Budhi Jumna and the Eastern Jumna Canal intersect the parganah from north to south, but irrigation is only carried on from the latter, and that only to a limited extent, owing to its being much below the level of the surrounding country. During the rains several hill torrents (the Chupra, Gangra, and Timli) run down the north-western portion of the parganah, and, uniting to form two streams, flow into the Jumna. One of these (the Naangang) crosses the canal at Shibabuddinpur, and eventually joins the Jumna in the Sultanpur parganah. In years of unusual rain they do much damage to the area of estates lying near their banks. Rabi crops predominate, and very little sugar-cane is grown. The last year of the thirty years' settlement showed a land revenue amounting to Rs. 48,454. Mr. VansAgnew increased this to Rs. 54,143, and Mr. H. Robertson, at his revision, proposed a land revenue of Rs. 73,336 on a total area of 75,335 acres, of which 62,236 acres were assessed to revenue, and 45,226 acres were cultivated. The actual revenue in 1872 amounted to Rs. 65,745 (or with cesses, Rs. 72,495), falling at a rate of Re. 0-9-0 per British acre on the\ntotal area, at Rs. 0-13-11 per acre on the area assessed to Government revenue, and at Rs. 1-7-2 per acre on the cultivated area. The sum paid by cultivators to the landowners as rent and cesses during the same year has been estimated at Rs. 1,25,794.\n\nThe soil generally throughout the parganah is a soft light rausti, easily worked and very productive with an average rainfall, which is here from fifteen to twenty inches more than in Saharanpur. The characteristic soil found wherever the parganah is not cut up by hill torrents, and in the strip of land lying between the Budhi Jumna and the Jumna, is of a dark chocolate colour, and highly fertile when of any depth. There are also a few estates in the khadir of the Jumna where a clay soil is found combined with rich vegetable deposits. The northern portion is free from swamps and accumulations of water of any kind, and, owing to the great depth of the spring-level (100 to 150 feet), the construction of wells is impracticable. In the south, irrigation from wells is carried on to some extent. The cultivation generally is somewhat backward, though the people are, as a rule, prosperous and contented.\n\nBetween the years 1839-40 and 1859-60, six whole villages and 31 portions of villages, having an area of 13,107 acres, and paying a revenue of Rs. 5,804, and valued at Rs. 68,117, were transferred by private arrangement in this parganah. The transfers by decree of Court comprised 34 portions of villages, having an aggregate area of 5,738 acres, and paying a revenue of Rs. 3,950. The value recorded was Rs. 39,491. Out of the 24 whole and 84 portions of villages remaining with the original proprietors, 1,023 acres, bearing a revenue of Rs. 1,058, valued at Rs. 4,760, of the former, and 10,884 acres, bearing a revenue of Rs. 6,112, valued at Rs. 58,050, of the latter, were under mortgage. These statistics give a percentage of private transfers to the total area of 17 per cent., of transfers by decree of Court amounting to 7 per cent., and of transfers by mortgage amounting to 18 per cent. The average value per acre in each of these cases was Rs. 5-3, Rs. 6-14, and Rs. 5-2, and the land revenue assessed amounted to Rs. 0-7-1; Rs. 0-11-0 and Rs. 0-9-0 per acre, respectively. The result from the entire parganah on 42 per cent. of the total area gives an average value of Rs. 5-14-0 per acre when the average land revenue amounted to Rs. 0-9-3 per acre. Sayyids lost three entire villages and ten shares, and Hindu Rajputs lost three villages and thirty-nine shares.\n\nAccording to the census of 1872, parganah Faizabad contained 129 inhabited villages, of which 61 had less than 200 inhabitants; 43 had between 200 and 500; 21 had between 500 and 1,000; one had between 1,000 and 2,000; and three had between 2,000 and 3,000. The settlement papers showed 105 estates, of which one was held free of revenue, and another was a jungle grant. The total population in 1872\nnumbered 42,882 souls (19,536 females), giving 235 to the square mile. Classified according to religion, there were 25,630 Hindus, of whom 11,532 were females; and 17,252 were Musalmans, amongst whom 8,004 were females; and distributing the Hindu population amongst the four great classes, the census shows 1,373 Brahmans, of whom 594 were females; 317 Rajputs, including 124 females; 1,644 Baniyas (711 females); whilst the great mass of the population is included amongst \"the other castes\" of the census returns, which show a total of 48,796 souls, of whom 22,056 are females. The principal Brahman sub-division found in this parganah is the Gaur (1,366). Rajputs show members of the Khagi (148) and Bais clans, and the Baniyas belong principally to the Agarwala (1,349), Sarauji and Dasa subdivisions. The other castes belong to the same classes as have already been given under the notice of parganah Haraura; Chamars number 8,243 souls, and Malis, Kahars, Kumhars, &c., are proportionately numerous. Of the 103 revenue-paying estates in the parganah, there are 50, each of which forms the property of only one class, viz., Europeans, 3; Musalmans, 3; Mahajans, 17; Rajputs, 21; and Gujars, 3. The cultivators are chiefly Gujars, Garas and Sains. The Musalmans show Shaikhs (801), converted Fundirs (133), Chauhans (16), other Rajputs (794), Gujars (3,048), and Pathans (492); the remainder are entered without distinction.\n\nThe occupations of the people are shown in the statistics collected at the census of 1872. From these it appears that of the male adult population (not less than fifteen years of age) 212 are employed in professional avocations, such as Government servants, priests, doctors, and the like; 1,081 in domestic service, as personal servants, water-carriers, barbers, sweepers, washermen, &c.; 782 in commerce, in buying, selling, keeping or lending money or goods, or the conveyance of men, animals, or goods; 7,150 in agricultural operations; 1,469 in industrial occupations, arts and mechanics, and the preparation of all classes of substances, vegetable, mineral, and animal. There were 3,893 persons returned as labourers, and 368 as of no specified occupation. Taking the total population, irrespective of age or sex, the same returns give 659 as landholders; 17,380 as cultivators; and 24,843 as engaged in occupations unconnected with agriculture. The educational statistics, which are confessedly imperfect, show 191 males as able to read and write out of a total male population numbering 23,346 souls.\n\nFaizabad is also known as Faizabad Bahat. In the time of Akbar it was known as Raipur Tatar from the village of Raipur, which still exists on the banks of the canal. The name was changed to Faizabad when Shahjah\u00e1n built his hunting seat at Badshah Mahal. It then became the centre of a sirkar containing twenty-four mahals; whilst Saharanpur was reduced to seventeen. In 1840-41 Faizabad had a revenue of Rs. 22,291, and in the\nfollowing year received villages assessed at Rs. 10,081, chiefly from taluka Patchar. At the same time it lost villages assessed at Rs. 6,230, leaving the land revenue at Rs. 26,142. The next great change took place in 1855, when one village was transferred to parganah Saharanpur, and 25 villages, having an area of 14,931 acres, assessed at Rs. 14,163, and with a population of 10,598 souls, were received from Bahat; and three villages, with an area of 2,236 acres, and assessed at Rs. 2,367, were received from parganah Sultanpur. These transfers left the parganah in 1855 with an area of 76,042 acres, distributed amongst 104 villages, assessed at Rs. 46,202.\n\nFatehpur, a village in parganah Haraura of the Saharanpur district, is distant 15 miles from Saharanpur, 17 miles from Nagal, 15 miles from Rurki, and 13 miles from Mohand, with a population of 579 souls in 1872. Fatehpur possesses a dak bungalow and an encamping-ground for troops half a mile from the Saharanpur road, open, large and sloping to the south, with a little shade on higher ground. Supplies are procurable, and water is plentiful. The route from Nagal lies through a well wooded and cultivated country, passing Saisana at 7\u00bd miles, Barsara at 9\u00bc miles, and Haraura at 10\u00be miles. Up to this, the road is second-class, unmetalled and heavy, and from it the Saharanpur metalled road is travelled. Cultivation continues to 15\u00bd miles, when the country becomes jungly. There is a branch post-office and police-station at Fatehpur. From Rurki the road is good, level, metalled and bridged; passes Rampur (q.v.) at two miles, and junction of Haraura road at seven miles. Hence to Mohand, a small village at the foot of the pass to Dehra, the road crosses the Solani, here called the Kandur, by a ford which is passable except after heavy rains (2 miles); cultivation for 10\u00bd miles; then dense jungle; no water after leaving cultivation. Road level, metalled and bridged.\n\nGangoh, the chief town of the parganah of the same name in the Saharanpur district, is distant 23 miles south-west from the town of Saharanpur. The population in 1847 was 6,260, and in 1865 was 10,899. In 1872 there were 10,982 inhabitants, of whom 5,049 were Hindus (2,382 females), and 5,930 were Musalmans (2,870 females). Distributing these amongst the urban and rural classes proper, there were 258 landholders, 1,289 cultivators, and 9,435 persons pursuing occupations unconnected with agriculture. The number of enclosures in 1872 was 1,092, of which 421 were occupied by Hindus, and 670 by Musalmans. The number of houses in the same year was 2,503, of which 1,292 were built with skilled labour, and 1,211 with unskilled labour. Of the houses built with skilled labour, 582 were occupied by Hindus, and 710 by Musalmans, and of the 1,211 mud huts, 506 were inhabited by Hindus, and 704 by Musalmans. The area of the town site is 99 acres, giving 111 persons to the square acre. Taking the male adult population (exceeding fifteen years of age), more than fifty pursued\neach of the following occupations:\u2014Barbers, 80; beggars, 152; butchers, 60; cultivators, 452; grain purchasers, 76; labourers, 431; landowners, 71; money-lenders, 52; painters, 66; potters, 64; purohits, 51; servants, 339; shop-keepers, 428; sweepers, 64; and weavers, 612.\n\nThe Musalm\u00e1ns are chiefly Pirz\u00e1dahs, and are devoted Wah\u00e1b\u00eds. They are in miserable circumstances, though owning the town; but of the 1,255 sharers only a few G\u00fajars work with their own hands, the rest are too proud to work, though not ashamed to beg.\n\nThere are five muhallas inhabited by Hind\u00fas, but the town consists really of an old and new quarter, the former said to have been founded by the legendary hero, Raja Gang, who gave his name to the place, and the latter by the famous saint Shaikh Abdul Kadd\u00fas, who has given his name to the mohalla in the western suburb known as Sar\u00e1i Shaikh Abdul-kadd\u00fas. This mohalla contains three large makbaras or tombs, around which are grouped the smaller tombs of those who desired to lay their remains near the ashes of the saintly personages who repose in the larger buildings. The site of the town is fairly raised, and even becomes a mound in the centre, where the school-house now stands, and where formerly there was an old fort. Around the town there are many groves of mango, siras, j\u00e1man and sis\u00fa. To the south there is a large jhil-like expanse known as the t\u00e1l\u00e1b. The streets and b\u00e1z\u00e1r ways are narrow and tortuous, but most of them are now paved, and have a centre drain of brick-work. There are many good houses belonging to Mah\u00e1jans, some of them double-storied, with flat roofs. The water in the wells is good, and in the higher parts of the town is found at a depth of 40 feet from the surface, and in the lower parts at 30 feet. There is no canal irrigation near, and the people enjoy tolerable health, though, in common with the upper portion of the D\u00fa\u00e1b, fever prevails here during the autumn. Act XX. of 1856 (the Chauk\u00edd\u00e1ri Act) is in force, and in 1873 supported a village police numbering 23 men of all ranks, at an annual cost of Rs. 1,278, which is met from a house-tax. Twelve public sweepers are also employed, and their cost is defrayed from the same source. The income from all sources in 1872-73 amounted to Rs. 5,191, giving an incidence of Re. 0-6-3 per head of the population, and Re. 1-12-11 per house. During the same year Rs. 1,580 were expended on wages, drains, culverts and paving. The town possesses a good school-house, where a tahsil\u00ed school has been for some time established, a dispensary, first class police-station, and a branch post-office. There is no trade and no evidence of prosperity, except in the houses of the money-lenders.\n\nGangoh during the mutiny of 1857 was frequently threatened by the G\u00fajars led by one Fathua, who set himself up as Raja Mutiny. of those parts, and burned Nak\u00far. His head-quarters was at Bh\u00fadakheri, which was attacked by a force under Mr. H. D. Robertson\nand Lieutenant Boisragon towards the end of June. Reinforced by the R\u00e1ngars of the neighbourhood, the G\u00fajars, to the number of about 3,000 men, made a stand near the villages of Umprur, Shahpur and M\u00e1npur, but were defeated with great loss, and pursued as far as Kunda Kal\u00e1n, which was captured and burned. The object of this gathering was an intended attack upon Lakhnauti and Gangoh, which there is reason to believe was due to the instigation of the influential Musalm\u00e1n residents of Ambahta and Nak\u00far. These persons had excited the G\u00fajars generally by promises of plunder and the destruction of bonds and records of debt, and the more influential amongst them by the hope of regaining their traditional influence. The R\u00e1ngars, who supplied large numbers of recruits to the irregular cavalry regiments, were urged on by hopes of a revival of purely Musalm\u00e1n rule, and fought bravely against the troops, asking and receiving no quarter.\n\nGangoh, a parganah of the Nak\u00far tahsil in the Sah\u00e1ranpur district, is bounded on the north by the Nak\u00far parganah; on the west by the Jumna river, which separates it from the Karn\u00e1l district of the Panj\u00e1b; on the south by parganahs Badauli and Jhanjh\u00e1na of the Muzaffarnagar district; and on the east by parganah R\u00e1mpur. According to the census of 1872, parganah Gangoh had a total area of 131 square miles, of which 76 square miles were under cultivation. The area assessed to Government revenue during the same year was 119 square miles, of which 71 square miles were cultivated, 37 square miles were culturable, and 11 square miles were barren. The same division into groups of villages for assessment purposes was made here as in Sult\u00e1npur. The first or canal-irrigated group is the best almost in the entire district, having at settlement more than two-thirds of the cultivated area under irrigation either from canals or wells. There are over two hundred brick-built wells in this tract, and the use of earthen wells was common until the canal, by raising the spring level, rendered their construction impracticable. The depth of water from the surface varies from six to twelve feet. Mr. Wynne, in writing of this group, says\u2014\"The G\u00fajars, to whom the bulk of the group belongs, have, like those in R\u00e1mpur, been reclaimed from the improvident habits and the tendency to cattle-lifting which characterise their brethren in the rest of the parganah. This happy result is due to the canal. The reward which the use of the canal water held out to industry was so great, so immediate, and so certain, that all the traditions of caste succumbed to the prospects of wealth, so that the G\u00fajars throughout the region watered by the canal are the most orderly, contented and prosperous of men.\" The northern villages of this group include much of the moist land of the K\u00e1tha basin, and those in the centre border on the Andauli jhil and produce fine rice crops, only inferior to the chahora rice of Sult\u00e1npur, and first-rate sugar-cane of the merthi\nspecies. The excessive moisture has, however, resulted in the appearance of red of a marked character in Fatehchandpur.\n\nThe remainder of the upland villages form the second group. Their condition is particularly unfavourable. Five villages about Lakhnauti are held by a fast decaying colony of Turkmans, and the remainder by an utterly improvident set of Gujars, who form a compact body, able and willing to prevent any outsider from settling amongst them. A few wealthy men have bought whole villages, but are unable to manage them from the want of cultivators, who do not settle in a place where they may see their crops carried off and their cattle lifted, whilst threats of further maltreatment are not wanting. The result is that the Gujars of these parts have no credit, and live as best they can, with their hands against every man's cattle, and with all the traditional habits of the race in full exercise. A few outsiders are now trying to establish themselves here, but, as Mr. Wynne observes \"it has required, and will long require, the constant exercise of the European officer's power to make the law respected in this tract; and there must long continue cause of apprehension that, if the charge of the parganah be at any time committed to an easy going Magistrate, the lawless habits of the inhabitants will re-assert themselves, and the intending colony will be swallowed up.\" But here, as elsewhere, the causes of this lawlessness are not far to seek. Mr. Wynne acknowledges that the tract had been for a long time over-assessed: the soil is poor and irrigation is scanty. The Gujars of the first group, of whom he gives such a favourable account, are of the same clan and family, and were opportunities given to the men of this tract, they would, no doubt, be glad to give up the precarious livelihood, eked out by plunder, they now enjoy, for the certain results obtainable by labour under favourable conditions.\n\nThe third group of mixed upland and lowland villages is the worst of all, containing an extremely stiff clay along the Saindli Nadi, unfit for rice cultivation, as it is very irretentive of moisture. Irrigation is scanty; the water is only eighteen feet from the surface, but earthen wells seldom last for more than two years. The crops are bad throughout, and poor. The fourth group, comprising the khadir lands, is in most respects similar to the same group in Nakur. The sandy strip covered with tamarisk jungle is succeeded by a rich alluvial soil near the Jumna. Irrigation is easy in the south, where earthen wells may, in some places, be constructed, and last for a year and-a-half. Fair maize is grown here and there, and the soil is admirably adapted in some places for sugar-cane.\n\nThe last year of Mr. Thornton's settlement showed a land revenue amounting to Rs. 86,340. This was increased by Mr. Vans Agnew to Rs. 83,981, and Mr. Wynne, at his revision, reduced the revenue to Rs. 78,859. This last assessment was made on a total area\namounting to 82,546 acres, of which 72,869 acres were assessed to the land revenue, and of these 47,139 acres were actually under cultivation. According to the census the land revenue for 1872 amounted to Rs. 72,109 (or with cesses, Rs. 79,804), falling at a rate of Re. 0-13-9 per British acre on the total area, at Re. 0-15-2 per acre on the area assessed to Government revenue, and at Re. 1-7-9 per acre on the cultivated area. The sum paid by cultivators to the landowners as rent and cesses during the same year has been estimated at Rs. 99,392.\n\nBetween the years 1839-40 and 1859-60 one whole village and 37 portions of villages, having an area of 3,905 acres, and paying a revenue of Rs. 4,287, and valued at Rs. 23,739, were transferred by private arrangement in this parganah. The transfers by decree of Court comprised five entire villages and 73 portions of villages, having an aggregate area of 9,333 acres, and paying a revenue of Rs. 10,775. The value recorded was Rs. 31,761. Out of the 27 whole and 82 portions of villages remaining with the original proprietors, 925 acres, bearing a revenue of Rs. 1,242, valued at Rs. 5,529, of the former, and 1,210 acres, bearing a revenue of Rs. 1,857, valued at Rs. 7,463, of the latter, were under mortgage. These statistics give a percentage of private transfers to the total area of five per cent.; of transfers by decree of Court amounting to ten per cent.; and of transfers by mortgage amounting to three per cent. The average value per acre in each of these cases was Rs. 6-1-0, Rs. 3-6-5 and Rs. 6-2-0, and the land revenue assessed amounted to Re. 1-1-6, Re. 1-2-5, and Re. 1-6-0 per acre, respectively. The result from the entire pargannah on 18 per cent. of the total area gives an average value of Rs. 4-7-0 per acre when the average land revenue amounted to Re. 1-0-3 per acre. G\u00fajars are the principal proprietors and were the principal losers.\n\nAccording to the census of 1872, parganah Gangoh contained 107 inhabited villages, of which 41 had less than 200 inhabitants; 39 had between 200 and 500; 21 had between 500 and 1,000; three had between 1,000 and 2,000; and two had between 3,000 and 5,000. The only town containing more than 5,000 inhabitants is Gangoh. The settlement records show 118 estates, of which three are held revenue-free in perpetuity. The total population in 1872 numbered 48,748 souls (24,858 females), giving 418 to the square mile. Classified according to religion, there were 36,162 Hind\u00fas, of whom 16,114 were females; 18,583 Musalm\u00e1ns, amongst whom 8,742 were females; and there were three Christians. Distributing the Hindu population amongst the four great classes, the census shows 3,230 Brahmans, of whom 1,506 were females; 92 Rajputs; 3,035 Baniyas (1,380 females); whilst the great mass of the population is included in \"the other castes\" of the census returns, which show a total of 29,805 souls, of whom 13,196 are females. The principal Brahman sub-divi-\nsion found in this parganah is the Gaur. The Baniyas belong principally to the Agarw\u0101l (2,333) and Sarau\u1e47i subdivisions. The other castes belong for the most part to the same divisions as those noticed in Sult\u0101npur. Those having more than one thousand members are as follow:\u2014Kumh\u0101rs, 1,172; Kah\u0101rs, 3,177; Cham\u0101rs, 5,758; Khakrobs, 2,308; Gujars, 5,828; M\u0101lis, 2,079; and J\u0101ts, 1,152. The Musalm\u0101ns show Shaikhs (1,502), Punjirs (362), Chanh\u0101ns (264), converted Rajputs (2,366), and Path\u0101ns (1,031); the remainder are entered without distinction. The landholders are principally Gujars, Path\u0101ns, Brahmins and Mah\u0101jans.\n\nThe occupations of the people are shown in the statistics collected at the census of 1872. From these it appears that of the male adult population (not less than fifteen years of age,) 217 are employed in professional avocations, such as Government servants, priests, doctors, and the like; 2,054 in domestic service, as personal servants, water-carriers, barbers, sweepers, washermen, &c.; 1,265 in commerce, in buying, selling, keeping or lending money or goods, or the conveyance of men, animals, or goods; 7,639 in agricultural operations; 3,295 in industrial occupations, arts and mechanics, and the preparation of all classes of substances, vegetable, mineral, and animal. There were 3,096 persons returned as labourers, and 732 as of no specified occupation. Taking the total population, irrespective of age or sex, the same returns give 501 as landholders, 20,751 as cultivators, and 27,496 as engaged in occupations unconnected with agriculture. The educational statistics, which are confessedly imperfect, show 389 males as able to read and write out of a total male population numbering 29,890 souls.\n\nGangoh, an old Akbari parganah, from which Jam\u0101lgarh was separated in the time of Naj\u012bb Kh\u0101n, showed a land revenue of Rs. 43,540 in 1840-41. The changes that took place in the following year gave an increase of villages assessed at Rs. 66,019, and a decrease of villages assessed at Rs. 7,968. Five villages were transferred to the Muzaffarnagar district, and fifty-eight villages were received, principally from parganah Lakhnauti. The changes that took place in 1855 are shown in the following table:\n\n| Name of parganah | Number of Villages | Area in acres | Land revenue | Population |\n|------------------|--------------------|---------------|--------------|------------|\n| Nak\u016br            | 52                 | 27,048        | 22,069       | 18,759     |\n| R\u0101mpur           | 11                 | 4,914         | 3,111        | 435        |\n| Total            | 59                 | 31,042        | 26,086       | 15,960     |\n\n| Name of parganah | Number of Villages | Area in acres | Land revenue | Population |\n|------------------|--------------------|---------------|--------------|------------|\n| R\u0101mpur           | 11                 | 4,914         | 3,111        | 435        |\n| Total            | 12                 | 5,220         | 6,860        | 3,149      |\nThis left 117 villages, having an area of 83,858 acres, and assessed at Rs. 86,052 in 1855.\n\nHaraura, a parganah of tahsil Saharanpur in the Saharanpur district, is bounded on the north by parganah Muzaffarabad; on the east by Saharanpur; on the west by Bhagwanpur; and on the south by Nagal. According to the census of 1872 parganah Haraura had a total area of 105 square miles, of which 82 square miles were under cultivation. The area assessed to Government revenue during the same year was 105 square miles, of which 82 square miles were cultivated, 12 square miles were culturable, and 11 square miles were barren. There is little irrigation, as the water in the streams which intersect the parganah is at too low a level to afford facilities for irrigation. To the south, common earthen (kuchha) wells are easily constructed, but to the north the soil is more stony and wells are not so easily made. There is, however, a large proportion of the cultivated area devoted to sugar-cane and other valuable crops and altogether there is more cultivation of the kharif than of the rabi harvest. This parganah is one of the best in the district, and shows a comparatively high rental. The thirty years' settlement was made by Mr. E. Thornton, and in the year before the commencement of the present assessment amounted to Rs. 82,231. Mr. Vans-Agnew fixed the land revenue at Rs. 84,796, which at Mr. H. Robertson's revision rose to Rs. 91,611 on a total area amounting to 66,818 acres, of which 59,672 acres were assessed to revenue, and 52,387 acres were cultivated. The land revenue for 1872 amounted to Rs. 83,275 (or with cesses, Rs. 91,649), falling at a rate of Re. 1-3-10 per British acre on the total area and on the area assessed to Government revenue, and at Re. 1-9-5 per acre on the cultivated area. The sum paid by cultivators to the landowners as rent and cesses during the same year has been estimated at Rs. 1,24,488. Except in a few estates in the khadir of the Solani and Hindan rivers, the soil presents considerable uniformity throughout the parganah. It is for the most part a light soft rausti, which becomes indurated by submersion, in which case it has been classified as dadar. The best soil (misam) forms twenty per cent. of the total cultivated area, and the worst soil only seven per cent. The soil of the northern portion of the parganah occasionally contains more sand than that of the south, and has been brought into cultivation more recently. These causes have been advanced to account for the more backward state of cultivation there.\n\nBetween the years 1839-40 and 1859-60, five whole villages and 58 portions of villages, having an area of 8,855 acres, and paying a revenue of Rs. 9,212, and valued at Rs. 66,515, were transferred by private arrangement in this parganah. The transfers by decree of Court comprised three entire villages and 68 portions of villages, having an aggregate area of 11,481 acres, and paying a revenue of Rs. 12,832. The\nvalue recorded was Rs. 56,915. Out of the 27 whole and 84 portions of villages remaining with the original proprietors, 302 acres, bearing a revenue of Rs. 250, valued at Rs. 4,000, of the former, and 5,858 acres, bearing a revenue of Rs. 5,873, valued at Rs. 58,088, of the latter, were under mortgage. These statistics give a percentage of private transfers to the total area of 13 per cent, of transfers by decree of Court amounting to 17 per cent., and of transfers by mortgage amounting to 9 per cent. The average value per acre in each of these cases was Rs. 7-8-2, Rs. 4-15-3, and Rs. 9-14-7; and the land revenue assessed amounted to Re. 1-0-7, Re. 1-1-10 and Re. 0-15-10 per acre respectively. The result from the entire parganah on 39 per cent. of the total area gives an average value of Rs. 6-14 per acre, where the average land revenue amounted to Re. 1-1 per acre. Hindu Rajputs lost five entire villages and 57 shares, or one-third of their possessions; Shaikhs and Pathans lost one village each.\n\nAccording to the census of 1872, parganah Haraura contained 118 inhabited villages, of which 30 had less than 200 inhabitants, 46 had between 200 and 500, 32 had between 500 and 1,000, 9 had between 1,000 and 2,000, and one had between 2,000 and 3,000. At the settlement there were 137 estates, of which one was held free of revenue. The total population in 1872 numbered 54,444 souls (24,979 females), giving 519 to the square mile. Classified according to religion, there were 37,686 Hind\u00fas of whom 17,066 were females; and 16,758 Musalm\u00e1ns, amongst whom 7,913 were females. Distributing the Hindu population amongst the four great classes, the census shows 2,889 Brahmans, of whom 1,355 were females; 1,679 Rajputs, including 655 females; 1,764 Baniyas (782 females); whilst the great mass of the population is included in \"the other castes\" of the census returns, which show a total of 31,354 souls, of whom 14,274 are females. The principal Brahman sub-division found in this parganah is the Gaun (2,763). Amongst the Rajputs, representatives of the Pundir (647), Khagi (153), and Vassht clans are found. The Baniyas chiefly belong to the Agarw\u00e1l (1,106), Sangal and Saraugi sub-divisions. The other castes show Jal\u00e1has, Jog\u00eds (657), Kamh\u00e1s (951), Haj\u00e1ms, Kah\u00e1rs (2,870), Cham\u00e1rs (12,152), Kh\u00e1kroba (1,266), G\u00fajars (1,813), Barhais (918), Loh\u00e1rs (604), Garariyas, Darz\u00eds, Kol\u00eds (954), M\u00e1l\u00eds (1,001), Sain\u00eds (920), Dhob\u00eds, Bh\u00e1ts, J\u00e1ts, Orhs (284), Chhip\u00eds, Son\u00e1rs, Kulw\u00e1rs, Kay\u00e1hs, Kal\u00e1ls, and Ah\u00edrs. Of the 136 estates paying revenue to Government there are 71 in each, of which there is but one class of proprietor, viz., Musalm\u00e1ns, 19; Jhojas, 2; Rohs, 3; Brahmans, 2; Tagas, 4; Mah\u00e1jans, 10; Rajputs, 13; G\u00fajares, 11; Khatris 1; Ah\u00edrs, 5; and Haj\u00e1ms, 1. The cultivators are chiefly Rajputs, Tagas and Sain\u00eds. The Musalm\u00e1ns show Shaikhs (397), converted Pundirs (184), converted Chauh\u00e1ns (72), other Rajputs (1,386), G\u00fajars (86), and Pathans (59); the remainder are entered without distinction.\nThe occupations of the people are shown in the statistics collected at the census of 1872. From these it appears that of the male adult population (not less than fifteen years of age), 489 are employed in professional avocations, such as Government servants, priests, doctors and the like; 1,702 in domestic service, as personal servants, water-carriers, barbers, sweepers, washermen, &c.; 915 in commerce, in buying, selling, keeping or lending money or goods, or the conveyance of men, animals or goods; 6,789 in agricultural operations; 3,090 in industrial occupations, arts and mechanics, and the preparation of all classes of substances, vegetable, mineral and animal. There were 4,252 persons returned as labourers, and 401 as of no specified occupation. Taking the total population, irrespective of age or sex, the same returns give 511 as landholders, 18,442 as cultivators, and 35,491 as engaged in occupations unconnected with agriculture.\n\nThe educational statistics, which are confessedly imperfect, show 373 males as able to read and write out of a total male population numbering 29,465 souls.\n\nHaransra was formed by Messrs. Craigie and Ross in 1855 from the neighbouring parganahs. The following table shows the parganahs from which the villages were received, with the details of area, revenue and population, amounting in all to 137 villages, with an area of 68,507 acres, a land revenue of Rs. 80,108, and a population numbering 50,900 souls:\n\n| Name of pargnah | Number of villages | Area in acres | Land revenue | Population |\n|-----------------|--------------------|---------------|--------------|------------|\n| Saharanpur      | 23                 | 11,738        | 15,140       | 9,481      |\n| Rurki           | 38                 | 14,295        | 18,723       | 9,519      |\n| Jawalapar       | 1                  | 521           | 500          |            |\n\nMuzaffarabad... 63 29,975 30,495 23,367\nDeoband... 21 11,334 14,500 6,107\nBahat... 1 644 750 435\n\nHardwar, a celebrated town in pargnah Jawalapur and tahsil Rurki of the Saharanpur district, is distant about 17 miles north-east of Rurki, and 39 miles north-east of Saharanpur. The permanent population is small, numbering only 4,919 souls in 1865, and\n4,800 in 1872. Hardw\u00e1r has borne several names. It was formerly called Kupil\u00e1 or Gupil\u00e1, so named after the sage Kapila, who is said for a long time to have performed religious austerities here. The place where he lived is still shown under the name Kapilasth\u00e1na, hence the pass is sometimes known as Kapila or Kupil\u00e1,\u00b9 the K\u00fat\u00edla of Timur's Memoirs.\u00b2 Another common name is Gangadw\u00e1ra or 'gate of the Ganges,' by which name it was known to Huen Thsang in the middle of the seventh century,\u00b3 and also to the Musalm\u00e1n writers Abu Rihan and Rashid-ud-d\u00edn.\u2074 It is now best known by the name Hardw\u00e1r or Haridw\u00e1r. The first name is derived from Hara, a synonym of Mah\u00e1deo or Shiva, and the second name from Hari, a synonym of Vishnu. The form Haridw\u00e1ra is found in the Kedarakhanda of the Skanda Pur\u00e1na and other Vaishnava works. In the Viahnu Pur\u00e1na it is called Haridw\u00e1ra, and the Ganges is said to flow from the \"toe of Vishnu.\"\u2075 The Vaishnavas point out the Hari ki charan or Hari ki pairi, 'the print of Vishnu's foot,' in support of this belief. Amarasinha gives Vishnupadi as one of the synonyms of the Ganges. The Shaivas, on the other hand, adhere to the form Hardw\u00e1r, and quote the origin of the Bh\u00e1girathi, or principal branch of the Ganges, in the Kail\u00e1s of Mah\u00e1deo in support of their theory. Another name given by Wilford is Gangaawartha, or the 'awartha of the Ganges,' which he thus explains:\u2014\"The awartha signifies an inclosed place of a circular form, and is more particularly applied to places of worship.\" This last term, and Gangadw\u00e1ra would seem to point out that there was originally a celebrated temple here of that name, around which the present town has sprung up.\n\nThe present town, and the ruined village of Mayapur, both lie on the right bank of the Ganges, at the southern base of the Siw\u00e1lik range, through which, by a gorge or natural breach, the river enters the plains. On the left is the Chandi Pah\u00e1r, on the top of which is a temple connected with those in Hardw\u00e1r itself. The river occupies the whole gorge, the width of which at its narrowest point is about one mile. Owing to its proximity to the hills and the great declivity of its bed, the Ganges here divides into several channels, intercepted by large islands, many of which are placed beyond the reach of high-flood water. One of these channels commences about two and a quarter miles above Hardw\u00e1r, and flows by Hardw\u00e1r, Mayapur and Kankhal, rejoining the parent river a little below the last town. It is from a spot on this branch, between Mayapur and Kankhal, that the head waters of the great Ganges Canal are taken. Hardw\u00e1r was visited in 1796 by Hardwicke, who calls it a small place situated at the base of the hills. Raper describes it in 1808 as very inconsiderable, \"having only one street, about fifteen feet in breadth and a furlong and a half in length. Most of the houses\n\n\u00b9 Wilford, As. Res. VI., 473. \u00b2 Dowson's Elliot, III., 455. \u00b3 Arch. Sur. II., 231.\n\u2074 Dowson's Elliot, I., 54. \u2075 Hall's Wilson's V. P., III., 302.\nhave the upper part of brick and the lower part of stone, which is of good quality.\" The street is now fully three-quarters of a mile long. South of the town lies the remains of the old town of Mayapura, the Mo-yu-lo or Mayura of Hwen Thsang. The name is traditionally derived from the temple of M\u00e1ya Devi still in existence, though possibly more correctly derived from the peacocks (mayura) which abound in the neighbourhood.\n\nHwen Thsang describes the town as being 3\u00bd miles in circumference, and very populous. General Cunningham considers that this account corresponds very closely with the site of the old city of Mayapura, as pointed out to him by the people.\u00b9 \"These traces extend from the bed of a torrent, which enters the Ganges near the modern temple of Sarovan\u00e1th, to the old fort of Raja Ben, on the bank of the canal, a distance of 7,500 feet. The breadth is irregular, but it could not have been more than 3,000 feet at the south end, and at the north end, where the Siw\u00e1l\u00edk hills approach the river, it must have been contracted to 1,000 feet. These dimensions give a circuit of 19,000 feet, or rather more than 3\u00bd miles. Within these limits there are the ruins of an old fort, 750 feet square, attributed to Raja Ben, and several lofty mounds covered with broken bricks, of which the largest and most conspicuous is immediately above the canal bridge. There are also three old temples dedicated to Nar\u00e1yana-sila, to Maya Devi, and to Bhairava. The celebrated gh\u00e1t, called the Pairi or 'feet gh\u00e1t,' is altogether outside these limits, being upwards of 2,000 feet to the north-east of the Sarovan\u00e1th temple. The antiquity of the place is undoubted, not only from the extensive foundations of large bricks which are everywhere visible, and the numerous fragments of ancient sculpture accumulated about the temples, but from the great variety of the old coins, similar to those of Sugh, which are found here every year. The temple of Nar\u00e1yana-sila, or Nar\u00e1yana-bali, is made of bricks, 9\u00bd inches square and 2\u00bd inches thick, and is plastered on the outside. Collected around it are numerous squared stones and broken sculptures. One of the stones has belonged to the deeply carved, cusped roof of an old temple. Amongst the broken sculptures, I was able to identify only one small figure of Buddha, the ascetic, surrounded by smaller figures of ascetic attendants. The temple of M\u00e1ya Devi is built entirely of stone; and, from the remains of an inscription over the entrance door-way, I think it may be as old as the 10th or 11th century. The principal statue, which is called M\u00e1ya Devi, is a three-headed and four-armed female in the act of killing a prostrate figure. In one of the hands I recognised the chakra, or discus; in another there was an object like a human head; and in a third hand the trishul. This is certainly not the figure of M\u00e1ya Devi, the mother of Buddha, nor is it exactly that of any goddess with which I am\n\n\u00b9Arch. Surv., II, 238.\nacquainted. It corresponds best with the figures of Durga; but if the name assigned to it is correct, the figure must be that of the Pauranik M\u00e1ya Devi, who, according to the Bhagavata, was the 'energy of the supreme, and by her, whose name is M\u00e1ya, the Lord made the universe.' But the action of the figure is most decidedly opposed to this identification; and I am therefore inclined to assign the statue to Durga, the consort of Siva, to whom Vishnu gave his discus, and Siva his trident. This attribution is the more probable as there is, close beside it, a squatted male figure with eight arms, which can only be Siva, and on the outside of the temple there is a Lingam, and a statue of the bull Nandi. There is also a fragment of a large female statue, which may possibly have been M\u00e1ya Devi, but it was too imperfect for recognition.\n\nAs there was nothing about the temple to give any clue to its identification, I can only conjecture that the original figure of M\u00e1ya Devi must have been destroyed by the Muhammadans, and that the vacant temple was afterwards occupied by the votaries of Siva. Outside the modern temple of Sarovarath, I found a statue of Buddha seated in abstraction under the Bodhi tree, and accompanied by two standing and two flying figures. On the pedestal there was a wheel, with a lion on each side as supporters; and as the figure was apparently naked, I concluded that it represents Adi Buddha, the first of the twenty-four Jain Hierarchs.\"\n\nThe great object of attraction at the present day is the Hari ke charan, or bathing gh\u00e1t, and the adjoining temple of Gangadw\u00e1ra.\n\nGeneral Cunningham notices that the original stone with the charan, or 'foot marks of Vishnu,' is said to have disappeared, but a second is now attached to the upper walls of the gh\u00e1t. \"Close by, in a small temple, is a well called the Brahma-kund, which is most probably the same that was noticed by Hwen Thsang in 634 A.D., but the great temple of his days has long ago disappeared. The gh\u00e1t itself is a very small one, being only 34 feet wide at the top, 89 feet at the bottom, with a flight of 39 steps to the water.\" Priority in ablution at the propitious moment is considered to be of great importance in a spiritual point of view, and many persons have formerly perished in the attempt to secure the advantage, being either crushed to death in the rushing crowd, or precipitated into the river and drowned. In 1819, \"in consequence of a desperate rush made by the infatuated pilgrims to gain a precedence in bathing, 430 persons were squeezed to death, among whom were several British sepoys, placed as guards to prevent this very catastrophe.\" Owing to this accident, the Government constructed the present gh\u00e1t of sixty steps and 100 feet in width, under the superintendence of Captain DeBude.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9Thornton, II., 141.\nThe rigidly pious, and those who dread to enter the water unassisted, are supported by a Brahman on each side. As, however, the depth close to the gh\u0101\u1e6d is not above four feet, the majority plunge in unassisted, men and women bathing together indiscriminately. The great assemblage of pilgrims is held annually on the first day of the month of Bais\u0101kh, the commencement of the Hindu solar year, which corresponds with the entry of the sun into the sign of Aries or Meha. But this day no longer corresponds with the vernal solstice: in 1796 it fell on the 8th of April, in 1808 on the 10th, and now for many years on the 11th or 12th April. Every twelfth year the planet Jupiter (Vrihaspati) is in the sign Aquarius (Kumbha) at the time of the sun\u2019s entry into Aries, and the fair is then called a Kumbh-mela. These are occasions of peculiar sanctity, and the fairs are attended by great multitudes. Hardwicke estimated the attendance at the Kumbh-mela of 1796 at two millions and a half, and Raper at the following Kumbh, in 1808, says\u2014\u201cIf we estimate the number at two millions of souls, we shall probably fall short rather than exceed the reality.\u201d Bacon, writing of an ordinary year, at a much later date, puts down the attendance at from two to three hundred thousand. In these calculations, however, it must be remembered that these numbers never appeared at one time, as those who bathe come in the morning and leave in the evening or on the next day, so that there is a constant succession of pilgrims. The Adh-kumbh or every sixth year also attracts a great number of the devout. The ordinary attendance of late years is under 100,000, and treble that number at the Kumbh. The next Kumbh takes place in 1832.\n\nFrom Hardw\u0101r great numbers of pilgrims proceed to the Shaiva shrine of Kedarn\u0101th, and the Vaishnava temple of Badrin\u0101th, both of which are situated in British Garhwal, and on their way worship at the sacred Pray\u0101gas (or confluences of two rivers), at Deopray\u0101g, Rudrpray\u0101g, Karnpray\u0101g, Nandpray\u0101g and Vishnupray\u0101g.\n\nOn the day of which the Hardw\u0101r fair is the anniversary, the Ganges is said to have first appeared upon earth. At the present time a very conspicuous portion of the bathers at Hardw\u0101r come from the Panj\u0101b and distant parts of Rajput\u0101na. Religion, however, is not the sole incentive that draws these crowds together; trade and amusement are as much thought of. The Hardw\u0101r mela forms one of the principal horse fairs in these Provinces from which the remounts for the native cavalry are drawn, though general report shows that the class of horses now exhibited are not so good as formerly. Commodities of all kinds\u2014Native and European\u2014are exposed for sale, and the trade in grain and food-stuffs alone forms an important and lucrative traffic. Great attention has been paid, of late years, to the police and sanitary arrangements of these fairs, so that now there is practically\n\n---\n\n1 See Thomas\u2019s Prinsep: Useful tables, 184.\nvery little danger to the public health or peace to be apprehended from these assemblies. The management of the funds derived from the leasing of sites for booths and flower-sellers during the fair is in the hands of the committee of the Hardw\u00e1r Municipal Union, and of late years large sums have been expended on the repairs of gh\u00e1ts, paving streets, metalling roads, planting trees, erecting latrines, building sar\u00e1sis for travellers, and other similar works of public utility. The expenditure during 1873-74 on original works amounted to over fifteen thousand rupees. The K\u00fambh fair of 1867 was the largest on record since the British occupation, and a full account of the admirable sanitary, police and administrative arrangements of that year will be found in the supplement to the Gazette of India for August 24th, 1867.\n\nHardw\u00e1r is mentioned in the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata as one of the places visited by Arjuna during his exile\u00b9 and \"many Brahmans went with Arjuna, and he made pilgrimages to all the holy places, and he went to Hardw\u00e1r on the river Ganges, and bathed there; and a damsel named Ul\u00fapi, the daughter of V\u00e1suki, the Raja of the N\u00e1gas, was likewise bathing there, and she saw Arjuna and besought him to espouse her, and he abode with her many days.\" The Ram\u00e1yana gives the Shaiva story of the descent of the Ganges from the Him\u00e1laya upon the head of Shiva. This story is told at great length in the Ram\u00e1yana, and an abstract of it occurs in the Vishnu and other Pur\u00e1nas, with the substitution of Vi\u015bhnu for Shiva.\u00b2 According to the Vi\u015bhnu Pur\u00e1na, Sumati and Kesini were the wives of S\u00e1gara, and bore him, the one a son, and the other 60,000 sons. S\u00e1gara determined on performing a horse sacrifice. The horse was loosened, but was carried off. In searching for him they descended to P\u00e1t\u00e1la, where they met the great sage Kapila, who reduced the 60,000 sons of S\u00e1gara to ashes on account of their ill-conduct in the world above. S\u00e1gara's remaining son, Am\u00famat, was then sent to recover the horse. He succeeded in assuaging the Rishi's wrath, who not only gave him the horse but promised him that his grandson should bring down the 'river of heaven' upon earth; and that when its waters should wash the bones and ashes of the sons of S\u00e1gara, they should be raised to heaven. \"Such is the efficacy of the stream that flows from the toe of Vi\u015bhnu, that it confers heaven upon all who bathe in it designedly or who even become accidentally immersed in it: those even shall obtain swarga whose bones, skin, fibres, hair, or any part shall be left, after death, upon the earth which is contiguous to the Ganges.\" S\u00e1gara completed his horse sacrifice, and in memory of his sons, designated the chasm that they had dug on their way to P\u00e1t\u00e1la, S\u00e1gara. This myth has taken a firm hold of the people of India, and is believed in by all Hind\u00fas. Kapilasth\u00e1na is still pointed out at Hardw\u00e1r. Again, the ocean is now known as S\u00e1gara, and at the island of S\u00e1gara, at the mouth of the H\u00fagli, a second Kapilasth\u00e1na is\n\n\u00b9 Wheeler, I., 145. \u00b2 Ibid., II., 46; V. F. III., 297.\npointed out. There would be no incompatibility in the two sites could we imagine the tradition referred to the time when the ocean laved the slopes of the Siw\u00e1lik hills, and the Ganges first forced its way through the pass at Bhimghora. At Hardw\u00e1r is shown the place where Bh\u00edma, one of the five P\u00e1ndu brothers, was placed to guide the Ganges in its descent, and a hollow in the rock is pointed out as caused by a kick from Bh\u00edma\u2019s horse, whence the name Bhimghora (or Bh\u00edma\u2019s horse).\n\nOn the bank of the river, two and a half miles below the Pairigh\u00e1t, is an old temple sacred to Daksheswara, or lord of Daksha, a famous synonym of Shiva. It is said to mark the spot where Daksha prepared his sacrifice. The present building, says Cunningham, \u201cwas originally domed, but the dome was broken by a decayed banyan tree, which has now disappeared. The construction of the dome, however, shows that the temple is of later date than the Muhammadan conquest. In front of the temple there is a small square building containing a bell, which was presented by the Raja of Nepal in 1848 A.D.\u201d The legend of Daksha\u2019s sacrifice is related in the Vayu and other Pur\u00e1\u00e1s, which open with an account of Shiva\u2019s residence on one of the peaks of Meru, where, surrounded by his court, Shiva reclined upon a splendid couch accompanied by the daughter of the sovereign of the mountains. Daksha had commenced a holy sacrifice on the borders of Him\u00e1vat, at the sacred spot Gangadw\u00e1ra, or, as the Linga Pur\u00e1\u00e1 has it, at Kanakhala or Kankhal, at which all the gods, with the permission of Mah\u00e1d\u00e9o, were present. The sage Dadhicha, enraged at the want of respect shown to the great Mah\u00e1d\u00e9o, addressed Daksha and said, \u201cWhy do you not offer homage to the God who is the lord of life?\u201d Daksha spoke:\u2014\u201cI have already many Rudras present, armed with tridents, wearing braided hair, and existing in eleven forms. I recognize no other Mah\u00e1d\u00e9va.\u201d The sage then prophesied that the sacrifice should never be completed. In the meanwhile Sati or Uma, the consort of Shiva, and daughter of Daksha, indignant that her lord had no share of the sacrifices, urged him to exert his power and compel the other gods to grant him a share. Mah\u00e1d\u00e9o yielded to her entreaties, and created, from his mouth, a terrible monster, Virabhadra, who was ordered to spoil the sacrifice of Daksha. Virabhadra, accompanied by the dreadful goddess Rudrakali and her train, came to Kankhal, and destroyed the viands and beverages. In the confusion, Indra was knocked down and trampled upon, Yama had his staff broken, and Saraswati and the Matris had their noses cut off. All fared ill,\u2014Yajna, the lord of the sacrifice, was decapitated, and now forms the constellation Mrigasiras or Mangsir. Daksha, too, gave up his opposition to Mah\u00e1d\u00e9o, who generously granted him all the advantage that he would otherwise have reaped from the sacrifice. According to another account, Daksha was disgusted at the practices of Shiva,\n\n---\n\n1 Hall\u2019s edition of Willson\u2019s P. I., 120.\nhis going naked, smearing himself with ashes, carrying a skull, and behaving as if he were drunk, for which Shiva was rebuked by his father-in-law, and hence his rage. The later Puranas make Sati destroy herself through vexation at the treatment her husband received, and the Kashiikanda makes her throw herself direct into the sacrificial fire. Professor Wilson thinks the whole legend is fraught with interesting historical and archaeological relations. \"It is intended to intimate a struggle between the worshippers of Shiva and Vishnu, in which at first the latter, but finally the former, acquired the ascendancy.\" It is a favourite subject amongst the sculptures at Elephanta and Ellora. In one cave, Bimbhadr is represented with eight arms, in one of which is suspended Raja Daksha, a fact which would show that the legend is as old as the excavation of the caves. The Vayu and Brahma Puranas give the same story; but as we go onwards there are additions. The Kurma Purana makes Daksha say that no portion of a sacrifice is ever allotted to Shiva, and no prayers are directed to be addressed to him or his bride. In fact, each Purana, according as it leans to the side of the Vaishnavas or that of the Shaivas, distorts the story to suit its purposes. In the Linga Purana, Vishnu is beheaded in the fray, whilst in the Hari Vansa, Vishnu compels Shiva to fly, after taking him by the throat and nearly strangling him. \"The blackness of Shiva's neck arose from this throttling, and not, as elsewhere described, from his drinking the poison produced by the churning of the ocean.\"\n\nFrom the time of the Pandavas, bathing in the Ganges was considered a sacred duty. When Thang calls the river Mahabha-\n\nReputation for sanctity. dra, or the very 'propitious,' and even in his time hundreds of thousands of pilgrims used to assemble to bathe in its waters. The author of the Tarikh-i-Yamini, writing in the early part of the eleventh century, gives a similar account. Timur, in his Memoirs, relates that \"the Hindu infidels worship the Ganges, and once every year they come on a pilgrimage to this place (Haridwar), which they consider the source of the river, to bathe and to have their heads and beards shaved. They believe these acts to be the means of obtaining salvation and securing future reward. They dispense large sums in charity among those who wear the Brahmanical thread, and they throw money into the river. When infidels die in distant parts, their bodies are burned, and the ashes are brought to this river and are thrown into it. This they look upon as a means of sanctification.\" This account of Timur is a curious commentary upon the promise of Kapila to the son of Sagara, given above. Abul Fazl speaks of Haridwar as being considered holy for fourteen kos in length. One of Akbar's mints for copper coinage was established here, and the water of the Ganges was esteemed so much, according to Abul Fazl,\n\n1 Dowson's Elliot, III, 459.\nthat the Imperial Court, whilst in the Panjab, was always supplied with drinking water from Hardwar.\n\nThe principal events connected with the modern history of Hardwar is its sack by Timur in 1398, noticed in the history of the Saharanpur district. The rivalry of the Bairagts and Goshains culminated on the last day of the fair in 1760 in a pitched battle, which terminated in the defeat of the former, of whom some eighteen hundred were slain. Again, in 1796, the Goshains, venturing to resist the better-equipped Sikh pilgrims, were defeated, with the loss of five hundred men. The accident at the gh\u00e1t in 1819 is the only other fact worthy of record. The town is in the Hardwar Municipal Union, and possesses a third-class police-station and a post-office. There is a telegraph office at Mayapur in connection with the Ganges Canal works at R\u00fcrki. Hodgson gives the elevation of Hardwar above the sea as 1,024 feet.\n\nHardwar forms a stage on the route from Moradabad to Landour.\n\nRoutes.\n\nBetween Asafgarh and Bhogpur (6\u00bd miles) the Ganges is crossed by a ferry in the rains. From Bhogpur to Hardwar (13 miles) the road is fair in dry weather, but very trying in the rains: country, jungly; pass Ranimajra, 3\u00bd miles; Chandpur at 6; Jaiputa at 7\u00bd; cross the Ganges Canal at 12\u00bd, and the R\u00fcrki road at 12\u00be. Hardwar also forms a stage on the alternative route from R\u00fcrki to Dehra. From R\u00fcrki to Bahadurabad, 9\u00bd miles; thence to Hardwar, 7 miles; from Hardwar to Kansrao, 12 miles; thence to Lachhiwala, 8 miles; and from Lachhiwala to Dehra, 10\u00be miles. From Bahadurabad to Hardwar the country is cultivated, but the road is heavy and unmetalled; and from Hardwar to Kansrao it is worse, and very difficult, if not impassable, in places for carts. It passes Parduni at 4\u00bd miles, and descends to the gh\u00e1t at 10\u00bc miles; supplies onwards through the D\u00fcn scarce and difficult, jungle exceedingly dense and water bad. Mohand is connected by a third-class forest road along the foot of the hills with Hardwar.\n\nThe affairs of the Hardwar Municipal Union, comprising the neighbouring villages of Jawalapur, Hardwar and Kankhal, are managed by a committee of 17 members, of whom five hold office ex-officio, and 12 are elected by the tax-payers. The following statements give the statistics connected with the levying and disposal of the municipal funds, and also show the character of the import trade. The population within municipal limits was estimated at 19,782 souls in 1873-74, and the actual income derivable from taxation during the same year amounted to Rs. 15,854, giving an incidence of 13\u00b77 annas per head of the population, or if refunds on exports be deducted, to Rs. 14,196, showing an incidence of 11 annas 5\u00bd pie per head. Owing to the large moving population of pilgrims within the area of these towns, statistics as to consumption per head can hardly be accurate or complete:\u2014\nThe great increase under the head of miscellaneous revenue from 1872 to 1874 is due to the receipts and collections on account of the Hardwar fair being included in the accounts, and to the sale of land in 1873-74, which brought in Rs. 6,895. The local trade is almost entirely confined to supplying the wants of the pilgrims to Hardwar. A considerable through trade from the D\u00fcn passes through the town, consisting of exports of wood, string, rope and forest produce, and imports of grain, sugar, spices, cloth, and metals.\n\nIsl\u0101mnagar, a village in parganah Nak\u016br of the Sah\u0101ranpur district, is distant 13 miles south-west from Sah\u0101ranpur. The population in 1872 numbered 2,704 souls. Isl\u0101mnagar is a Path\u00e1n colony said to have been founded by Sard\u0101r Abdullah Kh\u00e1n, son of Jal\u0101l Kh\u00e1n, the founder of Jal\u0101labad in the Muzaffarnagar district. He quelled a G\u016bj\u0101r insurrection in the reign of Aurangzeb, and expelling the inhabitants, changed the name from G\u016bjarw\u0101la to Isl\u0101mnagar. The site lies close to, and to the east of one of the distributary channels of the Eastern Jumna Canal, but the people do not appear to have suffered much from fever.\n\nJab\u0101h\u0113ra, a town in parganah Manglaur of the Sah\u0101ranpur district, is distant eight or nine miles south-west of R\u016brki. The population in 1872 numbered 4,601 souls, and in 1865 there were 3,591 inhabitants. It lies on the road between Deoband and R\u016brki, and is also connected with Sah\u0101ranpur and\nManglaur by a fair-weather road. Jabarhera was the original residence of the notorious Gujar chief, R\u00e1mday\u00e1l Singh. It possesses a pretty masjid built by Naw\u00e1b Huk\u00edm Kh\u00e1n, formerly governor of the district, and a village school. Act XX. of 1856 (the Chaukid\u00e1ri Act) is in force, and in 1873 supported a village police numbering nine men, at an annual cost of Rs. 504, which is met from a house tax. The total income in 1872-73 amounted to Rs. 1,124, giving an incidence of Re. 0-5-5 per head of the population, and Re. 1-8-3 per house. During the same year more than one-third of the income was expended on drainage works, repairs to roads, and latrines. The town of Jabarhera must be distinguished from the village of Jabarheri lying between the S\u00edla Nadi and another branch of the West K\u00e1li Nadi.\n\nJah\u00e1ngirabad, a small parganah of the Sah\u00e1r\u00e1npur district, was separated from the old parganah of Raipur T\u00e1t\u00e1r in the reign of Shahjah\u00e1n, and remained a separate tappa until 1842, when it was absorbed in Faizabad, Sul-t\u00e1npur, and Jaw\u00e1lapur. In 1840-41 it yielded a land revenue of Rs. 4,403 only.\n\nJam\u00e1lgarh, an old tappa of the Sah\u00e1r\u00e1npur district, also known as Jam\u00e1l Khera, was separated from parganah Gangoh in the time of Najib Kh\u00e1n by one Jam\u00e1l Kh\u00e1n, the amil of the Rohilla chief. In 1840-41 it yielded a revenue of Rs. 5,820, and was absorbed in Nak\u00far in the following year.\n\nJa\u00far\u00e1si, an old Akbari parganah of the Sah\u00e1r\u00e1npur district, from which Sakrunda was separated in the time of Z\u00e1bita Kh\u00e1n. It remained a distinct parganah until 1855. In 1840-41 it gave a land revenue of Rs. 38,981, and in the following year lost, by transfer, villages assessed at Rs. 1,380, and gained villages assessed at Rs. 7,585. The parganah was broken up in 1855, and distributed as follows amongst the neighbouring parganahs:\n\n| Name of parganah | No. of villages | Area in acres | Land revenue | Population |\n|------------------|----------------|---------------|--------------|------------|\n| Haraura         | ...            | 1             | 521          | 500        | ...        |\n| R\u00fark\u00ed            | ...            | 91            | 66,189       | 84,254     | 87,612     |\n| Manglaur        | ...            | 26            | 11,368       | 11,168     | 7,304      |\n| Jaw\u00e1lapur       | ...            | 13            | 11,710       | 5,765      | 2,712      |\n| Bh\u00e1gw\u00e1sipur     | ...            | 22            | 25,694       | 9,461      | 5,369      |\n| Total           | ...            | 153           | 115,309      | 60,549     | 53,999     |\n\nJaw\u00e1lapur, a town in the parganah of the same name in the Sah\u00e1r\u00e1npur district, lies 14 miles to the north-east of R\u00fark\u00ed, and 36 miles east of Sah\u00e1r\u00e1npur. The population of Jaw\u00e1lapur in 1847 numbered 8,862 souls, in 1853 there were 12,162 inhabitants, and in 1865 there were 9,665. Of a total population in 1872 of 9,269 souls, there were 6,582 Hind\u00fas (3,029 females), and 2,687 Musalm\u00e1ns (1,320 females). The area of the town is 120 acres, giving\n77 persons to the square acre. Jaw\u00e1lapur lies in the north-eastern corner of the district, close to Hardw\u00e1r, with which it is connected for municipal purposes (see HARDW\u00c1R). The octroi system has been introduced here with some success. A large number of the Hindu residents consists of the Brahmans who officiate at Hardw\u00e1r, and these are at feud with the zam\u00ednd\u00e1rs, who are Rajputs converted to Isl\u00e1m. Hence much litigation and quarrelling takes place. There is a first-class police-station, a branch post-office, a tahs\u00edl school, and a good dispensary in the town. The present zam\u00ednd\u00e1rs are said to be the descendants of the founders of the town.\n\nJAW\u00c1LAPUR, a parganah in tahs\u00edl R\u00farki of the Sah\u00e1ranpur district,\n\nArea. is bounded on the north by the Siw\u00e1l\u00edk hills, which separate it from the Dehra D\u00fan district; on the west by parganahs R\u00farki and Manglaur; on the south by parganah Gordhanpur of the Muzaffarnagar district; and on the east by the Ganges river, which separates it from the Bijnaur district. According to the census of 1872, this parganah had then a total area of 226 square miles, of which 70 square miles were under cultivation. The area assessed to Government revenue during the same year was 129 square miles, of which 70 square miles were cultivated, 44 square miles were culturable, and 15 square miles were barren. The villages of this parganah were divided into three groups for assessment purposes. The first group comprises the villages under the Siw\u00e1l\u00edks and along the Ganges Canal.\n\nNatural divisions. The natural slope of the country is here excessive, and is only partly counterbalanced by the abundant rainfall. In the villages to the south of the canal, irrigation is plentiful, and the soil yields fine crops of sugar-cane, cotton, and wheat; and in the depressions, rice of a fair description. Owing to the great depth of the spring-level (30 to 70 feet), there are few earthen wells. The second group consists of a few villages which are separated from the rest by the Pathari torrent, and yield good crops of wheat and rice. The third group includes the remainder of the parganah. The villages to the north-east of the B\u00e1nganga, and on its banks in the lower portion of its course, possess a very stiff soil, producing poor crops, and the population is too scanty to work such a refractory soil. Communication between the villages is also difficult by reason of the numerous streams which intersect this tract, and which are impassable owing to the swampy nature of their beds. In the villages near the Ganges, however, the soil is lighter and more friable, though, as a rule, thinner and poorer. Close on the Ganges, cultivation is sparsely scattered amid extensive plains of tar\u00e1i grass. Water is found at a depth of from six to eleven feet from the surface, and, except for tobacco and other garden produce, irrigation is not necessary. The whole of this group suffered much from the disturbances during 1857-58. Predatory bands of G\u00fajars and Banj\u00e1ras made it their home, and plundered and burned the villages. More hands to cultivate\nthe soil, and roads to carry off its produce, are sadly needed here; and the project of a road connecting it with Manglaur should be carried out.\n\nThe last year of Mr. Thornton's settlement showed a land revenue of Rs. 32,209, increased by Mr. Vans Agnew to Rs. 38,315.\n\nMr. Wynne, at his revision of Mr. Vans Agnew's settlement, proposed an assessment of Rs. 41,463 on a total area of 67,933 acres, of which 58,143 acres were assessed to land revenue, and of these 30,131 acres were then under cultivation. The actual land revenue for 1872 amounted to Rs. 50,686 (or with cesses, Rs. 55,776), falling at a rate of Re. 0-5-7 per British acre on the total area, at Re. 0-9-10 per acre on the area assessed to Government revenue, and at Re. 1-2-1 per acre on the cultivated area. The sum paid by cultivators to the landowners as rent and cesses during the same year has been estimated at Rs. 94,804.\n\nBetween the years 1839-40 and 1859-60 four whole villages and twelve portions of villages, having an area of 4,837 acres, and paying a revenue of Rs. 3,895, and valued at Rs. 20,902, were transferred by private arrangement in this parganah. The transfers by decree of Court comprised seven portions of villages, having an aggregate area of 1,083 acres, and paying a revenue of Rs. 521. The value recorded was Rs. 6,372. Out of the 60 whole and 11 portions of villages remaining with the original proprietors, 1,411 acres, bearing a revenue of Rs. 536, valued at Rs. 625, of the former, and 26 acres, bearing a revenue of Rs. 56, valued at Rs. 400, of the latter, were under mortgage. These statistics give a percentage of private transfers to the total area of seven per cent., of transfers by decree of Court amounting to two per cent., and of transfers by mortgage amounting to three per cent. The average value per acre in each of these cases was Rs. 4-5-1, Rs. 5-14-1, and Rs. 11-11-0, and the land revenue assessed amounted to Re. 0-12-10, Re. 0-7-8, and Re. 0-6-7 per acre, respectively. The result from the entire parganah on twelve per cent. of the total area gives an average value of Rs. 3-12-6 per acre, when the average land revenue amounted to Re. 1-10-10 per acre. The principal losers were Gujarars, who still hold twelve villages.\n\nAccording to the census of 1872, parganah Jawalapur contained 133 inhabited villages, of which 68 had less than 200 inhabitants, 39 had between 200 and 500, 16 had between 500 and 1,000; seven had between 1,000 and 2,000, and two had between 3,000 and 5,000. The only town containing more than 5,000 inhabitants is Jawalapur. The settlement records show that there are 146 estates in this parganah, one of which is a jungle grant. The total population in 1872 numbered 57,330 souls (25,333 females), giving 254 to the square mile. Classified according to religion, there were 45,398 Hindus, of whom 19,897 were females; 11,923 Musalmans, amongst whom 5,432 were females; and there\nwere 9 Christians. Distributing the Hindu population amongst the four great classes, the census shows 5,467 Brahmans, of whom 2,330 were females; 3,735 Rajputs, including 1,650 females; 3,088 Baniyas (1,242 females); whilst the great mass of the population is included in \"the other castes\" of the census returns, which show a total of 33,158 souls, of whom 14,675 are females. The principal Brahman sub-divisions found in this parganah are the Gaur (4,790), Saraswat and Ach\u00e1raj. The Rajputs belong to the Kh\u00e1gi (3,483) clan, and the Baniyas to the Agarw\u00e1l (2,179), Choti-Saran and Sarangi divisions. The other castes are for the most part the same as those noticed under the R\u00farki parganah. The castes having more than one thousand members in this parganah are the Kah\u00e1r, 1,974; Cham\u00e1r, 9,602; Kh\u00e1krob, 1,038; Guj\u00e1r, 1,311; Barhai, 1,134; Saini, 3,625; Lodha, 1,969, and Banj\u00e1ra, 1,608. The Musalm\u00e1ns are classified amongst Shaikhs (824); converted Pundirs, Chauh\u00e1ns and Rajputs (696); and Path\u00e1ns (578); the remainder are entered without distinction. The principal landowners belong to the Chauh\u00e1n, Rajput\u2014both Hindu and Musalm\u00e1n\u2014Brahman, Guj\u00e1r, Mah\u00e1jan and Saini divisions.\n\nThe occupations of the people are shown in the statistics collected at the census of 1872. From these it appears that, of the male adult population (not less than fifteen years of age) 1,578 are employed in professional avocations, such as Government servants, priests, doctors, and the like; 2,378 in domestic service, as personal servants, water-carriers, barbers, sweepers, washermen, &c.; 1,836 in commerce, in buying, selling, keeping or lending money or goods, or the conveyance of men, animals, or goods; 5,617 in agricultural operations; 2,927 in industrial occupations, arts and mechanics, and the preparation of all classes of substances, vegetable, mineral, and animal. There were 5,280 persons returned as labourers, and 913 as of no specified occupation. Taking the total population, irrespective of age or sex, the same returns give 128 as landholders, 15,970 as cultivators, and 41,232 as engaged in occupations unconnected with agriculture. The educational statistics, which are confessedly imperfect, show 144 males as able to read and write out of a total male population numbering 31,997 souls.\n\nJaw\u00e1lapur was known under the name of Bhogpur in Akbar's time, and until late years the records showed the name Bhogpur usu Jaw\u00e1lapur. It covers pretty nearly the area of the old parganah of Bhogpur, which was so called from a town of that name situated on the Ganges near Hardw\u00e1r. Tieffenthaler states that Hardw\u00e1r was also called Bhogpur, but Elliot thinks that this statement is incorrect. In 1840-41 Jaw\u00e1lapur yielded a revenue of Rs. 15,227, and in the following year received villages assessed at Rs. 1,809 from Jah\u00e1ng\u00edrabad. In 1855 considerable changes took place. Two villages, with an area of 1,409 acres, and a revenue of Rs. 750, were transferred to R\u00farki, whilst 17 villages, with an\n\n---\n\n1 Bernoulli, I., 147.  \n2 Beames' Elliot, II., 129.\narea of 15,937 acres, and a revenue of Rs. 9,023, were received from the same parganah, and 13 villages, with an area of 11,710 acres, and a revenue of Rs. 5,165, from Jaurasi. This left the total number of villages at 115, with an area of 106,143 acres, and a land revenue of Rs. 45,674 in 1855.\n\nKANKHAL, a town in parganah Jawalapur of the Saharanpur district, is distant 38 miles from Saharanpur, 16 miles from Rirki, and about one mile from Hardwar. The population in 1865 was 4,781, and in 1872 numbered 4,904 souls, consisting principally of Brahmans attached to the Hardwar temples, who intermarry exclusively with those of Jawalapur. The temple of Daksheswara or 'Lord of Daksha,' a synonym of Shiva, lies to the south of the town, and is supposed to mark the spot where the god Mahadeo spoiled the sacrifice of Daksha, and where Sati or Uma, daughter of Daksha and spouse of Shiva, immolated herself in the fire (see HARDWAR). Many of the houses here are very substantially built and have their walls decorated with fantastic pictures. The bank of the river is lined with shady and tastefully laid out gardens, and, notwithstanding the general want of sanitation which distinguishes it in common with other Saharanpur towns, the appearance of Kankhal is on the whole picturesque. The town is included in the Hardwar Municipal Union, and possesses an outpost of police and a village school. There are some rich mahajans resident here, and through their influence in 1857, the townsmen successfully resisted the attacks of a powerful body of dakaits. Kankhal, under the name Kanakhala, is mentioned in the Puranas, and the K\u0101lha-s\u0101r\u012bt-s\u0101gara.\n\nKATHA, an old parganah of the Saharanpur district, was separated from Deoband by Najib Khan, who established a tahsil at Badgaon to overawe the turbulent Pundir Rajputs. It remained a separate parganah up to 1855. In 1841-42 the land revenue amounted to Rs. 29,769, and in the following year, villages assessed at Rs. 11,480 were received from other parganahs. In 1855, the parganah was broken up, and its villages transferred to the parganahs mentioned below:\n\n| Parganah | No. of villages | Area in acres | Land revenue | Population |\n|----------|----------------|---------------|--------------|------------|\n| Rampur   | ...            | 8             | 6,818        | 9,229      | 5,282      |\n| Deoband  | ...            | 20            | 21,849       | 24,880     | 15,543     |\n| Nagal    | ...            | 9             | 7,268        | 7,870      | 4,525      |\n| Total    | ...            | 37            | 36,930       | 41,979     | 25,301     |\n\nMention is made of the Katha villages in the notices of the parganahs amongst which they have been distributed. From early times this parganah has been occupied by a colony of Pundir Rajputs, who have preserved their lands in the\nvery midst of the tract known, from the preponderance of Gujars amongst\nthe population, as G\u00fajr\u00e1t.\n\nKHERI, an old tappa or subdivision of the Sah\u00e1ranpur district, was sepa-\nrated from R\u00farki in the time of Z\u00e1b\u00edts Kh\u00e1n. The proprietors are converted\nHajp\u00fats, who, on becoming Musalm\u00e1ns, assumed the prefix R\u00e1o to their names.\nKheri, with the adjacent hill tracts, continued a separate tappa until the settle-\nment in 1838, when the excessive waste was cut off to form the Kheri jungle.\nThe cultivated portion was divided into villages and settled with the proprie-\ntors. These villages were subsequently absorbed in parganah Muzaffarabad.\nSome account of the tappa is given under the heads of 'waste' and 'old\nfamilies' in the district notice, and a full notice of the tract and its fiscal history\nwill be found in Mr. Thornton's report in I. Settlement Reports, 86\u201490. The\npatt\u00eds into which the estate was divided, and the arrangements made at settlement,\nare also detailed there. Being of purely administrative interest, and already\nin an available form, these details need not be repeated here.\n\nKOTWAL, a village in parganah Manglaur of the Sah\u00e1ranpur district, is dis-\ntant 20 miles from the civil station. The population in 1872 numbered 1,087\nsouls. The western half of the village is occupied by G\u00e1ra Musalm\u00e1ns, who\npossess a good masjid; and the eastern half is inhabited by Hindu Gujars and\nBrahmans, who have a temple. The village belongs to the Landhaura estate.\nThe site lies about a mile to the west of the Sifa Nadi, and is fairly raised.\nThere are about 422 mud houses separated by good open ways. The water in\nthree brick wells stood at sixteen feet from the surface in Maroh, and is reported\ngood; the village itself, too, is clean and well-kept.\n\nLAKHNAUTI, an old Akbari parganah of the Saharanpur district, was broken\nup in 1842: seven villages were transferred to Rampur, one village to the\nK\u00e1tha parganah, and fifty-seven to Gangoh. The remainder were absorbed\namongst the neighbouring parganahs of the Muzaffarnagar district.\n\nLAKHNAUTI, a village or decayed town in parganah Gangoh of the Sah\u00e1-\nranpur district, is distant 26 miles from the town of Sah\u00e1ranpur. The popu-\nlation in 1865 was 4,157, and in 1872 was 3,998. This village lies on the road\nto Karn\u00e1l, between Gangoh and the Jumna. It possesses a very fine specimen\nof an old native fort, a village school, and a branch post-office. Act XX. of\n1856 is in force, and in 1872 supported a village police of nine men, at a cost of\nRs. 504, which is defrayed from a house-tax. The total income from all sources\nin 1872-73 amounted to Rs. 1,342, giving an incidence of Re. 0-5-6 per head of\nthe population, and Re. 1-8-5 per house assessed. Lakhnauti and the five villages\nin the neighbourhood are owned by a colony of Turkm\u00e1ns, who are in the last\nstages of poverty and embarrassment. This town, however, was a place of con-\nsiderable strength in the last century. In 1794 Bapu Sindhia, the Marhatta\nGovernor of Sah\u00e1ranpur, was for some time engaged in reducing it to submis-\ntion; and it was not until reinforcements had arrived under his lieutenant, George Thomas, and a practicable breach had been effected, that the commandant saw fit to negotiate its surrender.\n\nLandhaura, a large village in parganah Manglaur of the Saharanpur district, lies about five miles to the south-east of R\u00farki, and 28 miles to the east of Saharanpur. The population in 1853 numbered 5,197 souls, and in 1865 there were 5,118 inhabitants. In 1872 the total population amounted to 5,023 souls, of whom 3,534 were Hindus (1,646 females), and 1,489 were Musalmans (689 females). The town site covers 92 acres, giving 55 persons to the acre. The inhabitants are chiefly Gujars, the clansmen of the notorious Gujar chief, Raja Ramdayal Singh. Landhaura possesses a village school and a post-office. There is an old fort here surrounded by a ditch, which has been turned into a receptacle for the village sewage. The village was burned for excesses committed during the mutiny.\n\nLibarheri, a village in parganah Manglaur of the Saharanpur district, is distant 25 miles from Saharanpur, and 7\u00bd miles due south from R\u00farki. The population in 1872 numbered 3,158 souls, and in 1865 there were 3,470 inhabitants, principally Tagas and Jats. It has a village school, and forms a portion of the Manglaur Union for the purposes of the Chaukidari Act (XX. of 1856). The neighbourhood of Libarheri is celebrated for its sugar-cane, of the species known as 'merhi.' There are some trees near the town, and much rice and high-crop cultivation. Cholera and fever have been prevalent for years. The soil contains much clay used for brick-making and pottery. The drainage, however, is bad, and there are many excavations full of stagnant water around the site, which are drained towards the Ganges Canal. There are also two distributary channels close to the town, and the water-level in these and the canal is higher than the town site, hence the spring-level in the wells has risen from 30 feet from the surface to 18 feet in the cold weather, and 10 feet in the rains, and the water then becomes bad and undrinkable. The town is composed chiefly of mud huts, and the ways are unmade and full of cavities,\u2014the receptacles of all kinds of impurities and filth. The general health, as may be supposed, is extremely bad.\n\nMalhaipur, an old parganah of the Saharanpur district, was absorbed in 1842 amongst the neighbouring parganahs. It then gave a land revenue amounting to Rs. 51,453. It was one of the old Akbari parganahs, and lay to the east of the town of Saharanpur, having its villages very much intermixed with those of the Saharanpur parganah. The settlement in 1838 was formed by Mr. Thornton (I., Settlement Reports, 65). The town of Malhaipur was one of the places visited by Timur's army in his invasion of the district in 1398 A.D.\n\nMan Singh-ke-Tanda, a small village on the road from Saharanpur to the Dehra valley, is situated in parganah Muzaffarabad, 23 miles from the\ntown of Saharanpur. There is an out-post of police stationed here for some years.\n\nManglaur, the chief town of the parganah of the same name in the Saharanpur district, is distant six miles due south of Rurki, and 16 miles south-east of Saharanpur. The population in 1847 was 5,959, in 1853 there were 10,322 inhabitants, and in 1865 there were 9,665. In 1872, out of a total population numbering 9,202 souls, there were 3,049 Hind\u00fas (1,385 females), and 6,153 Musalm\u00e1ns (2,937 females). The town site is fairly raised, and occupies 171 acres, giving 54 persons to the acre. The Musalman inhabitants are principally Julahas (weavers), who are now much impoverished. Some of the Hindu zamindars are wealthy men. There are numerous brick built houses, surrounded and divided by mud huts, and imbedded amongst groves of trees or luxuriant crops. The roadways are in fair repair. To the south is a deep depression, formerly used as a brick-field, but now irrigated from the canal and cultivated. There is a similar excavation on the west, and numerous water-holes on all sides of the town, which have of late years been drained. Many of the shops in the bazar are out of repair, and there is no trade. The water in the wells is found at a depth of eighteen feet from the surface, and is said to have risen from thirty feet since the introduction of the canal, which runs at about a quarter of a mile from the town. The Chaukidari Act (XX. of 1856) is in force, and in 1873, in conjunction with Libarheri, supported a village police numbering 21 men of all ranks, at an annual cost of Rs. 1,152, besides a staff of 16 scavengers. The total income from all sources in 1872-73 amounted to Rs. 3,276, giving an incidence of Re.0-4-0 per head of the population, and Re. 1-7-8 per house assessed. During the same year the conservancy establishment was increased, and nearly Rs. 2,000 were expended on local improvements. Much, however, remains to be done here in the way of sanitation and drainage. The people suffer very much from ague and enlargement of the spleen, both of which are diseases due to malaria. Manglaur is said to have been founded by one Raja Mangal Sain, a Rajput feudatory of the celebrated Vikramaditya. Traces of the foundations of the fortress of the founder are still visible near the town. Manglaur possesses a second class police-station, a post-office, and a parganah school, and was once celebrated for its carpentry, but nearly all the best workmen died during the fever epidemic of 1868-69. (See Cutcliffe's Report, Appendix A., 1.)\n\nManglaur, a parganah in tahsil Rurki of the Saharanpur district, is bounded on the north by parganahs Bhagwanpur and Rurki; on the south, by the Muzaffarnagar district; on the east, by parganah Jawalapur; and on the west by parganahs Nagal and Deoband. According to the census of 1872 this parganah had then a total\narea of 121 square miles, of which 94 square miles were under cultivation. The area assessed to Government revenue during the same year was 120 square miles, of which 94 square miles were cultivated, 10 square miles were culturable, and 16 square miles were barren. At the time of settlement the villages in this parganah were divided into four groups. In the first group comprising those lying in the khadir to the east, the rausti soil is grey and loamy, and the ddkar soil is stiff and brown. There are some swampy patches especially near the Hadwaha, and the spring level is found at about nine feet from the surface. The staple crop is wheat, but good rice is produced here and there. The next group consists of those villages having a mixed upland and lowland area. The lowlands in a few of these villages to the north are good, and yield fair crops of rice; but in the greater number they are swampy, the springs having risen owing to percolation from the canal. To the south the lowlands have been injured by the new cut through which the waters of the Solani have been taken. The ridge of uplands is much cut up by ravines, and the level tract beyond is on the whole sandy and poor. The third group consists of a few villages on either bank of the Sila Khala, containing much poor bhada soil, and with little irrigation, owing to the depth of water from the surface (20 feet). The fourth group includes the upland villages irrigated from the Ganges Canal, which are well populated, irrigated and cultivated. A ridge of sand with a strip of bhada runs through this group, nearly parallel to the upland cliff. A second sandy ridge, first becoming apparent in the Rurki parganah, runs down this parganah on the west, first on one side of the Sila and then on the other, and passes into the Deoband parganah, and through it into the Muzaffarnagar district. The land between these ridges is productive and easily worked, and the Jat and Gujar cultivators are both industrious and prosperous.\n\nThe last year of the old settlement effected by Mr. E. Thornton showed a land revenue amounting to Rs. 96,487, which Land revenue. Mr. VansAgnew increased to Rs. 96,992. The late Mr. Wynne revised this assessment, and proposed Rs. 1,01,746. At that time the total area was found to be 77,070 acres, of which 66,370 acres were assessed to land revenue, and 59,311 acres were then under cultivation. The actual land revenue for 1872 amounted to Rs. 93,215 (or with cesses, Rs. 1,02,507), falling at a rate of Re. 0-8-2 per British acre on the total area, at Re. 0-13-7 per acre on the area assessed to Government revenue, and at Re. 1-5-0 per acre on the cultivated area. The sum paid by cultivators to the landowners as rent and cesses during the same year has been estimated at Rs. 1,26,659.\n\nBetween the years 1839-40 and 1859-60, fifty-two portions of villages, Allotments. having an area of 4,509 acres, and paying a revenue of Rs. 5,759, and valued at Rs. 35,858, were transferred\nby private arrangement in this parganah. The transfers by decree of Court comprised one entire village and 59 portions of villages, having an aggregate area of 5,732 acres, and paying a revenue of Rs. 7,510. The value recorded was Rs. 21,111. Out of the 66 whole and 78 portions of villages remaining with the original proprietors, 620 acres, bearing a revenue of Rs. 767, valued at Rs. 3,112, of the former, and 865 acres, bearing a revenue of Rs. 1,368, valued at Rs. 10,047, of the latter, were under mortgage. These statistics give a percentage of private transfers to the total area of 6 per cent., of transfers by decree of Court amounting to 7 per cent. and of transfers by mortgage amounting to 2 per cent. The average value per acre in each of these cases was Rs. 8-12-0, Rs. 4-9-10 and Rs. 12-7-0; and the land revenue assessed amounted to Re. 1-3-4, Re. 1-3-8 and Re. 1-5-0 per acre respectively. The result from the entire parganah on 15 per cent. of the total area gives an average value of Rs. 6 per acre when the average land revenue amounted to Re. 1-5-0 per acre. G\u00fajars and J\u00e1ts were the principal losers, yet the former still retain 39 entire villages, and the latter 12.\n\nAccording to the census of 1872, parganah Manglaur contained 115 inhabited villages, of which 86 had less than 200 inhabitants; 36 had between 200 and 500; 32 had between 500 and 1,000; eight had between 1,000 and 2,000; and one had between 3,000 and 5,000. The towns containing more than 5,000 inhabitants are Manglaur and Landhaura. The records show that at settlement there were 146 estates in this parganah, of which one was a jungle grant. The total population in 1872 numbered 66,742 souls (30,152 females), giving 551 to the square mile. Classified according to religion, there were 48,272 Hind\u00fas, of whom 21,498 were females; 18,468 Musalm\u00e1ns, amongst whom 8,654 were females; and there were two Christians. Distributing the Hindu population amongst the four great classes, the census shows 4,116 Brahmins, of whom 1,820 were females; 135 Rajp\u00fats, including 56 females; 3,109 Baniyas (1,385 females); whilst the great mass of the population is included in \"the other castes\" of the census returns, which show a total of 40,912 souls, of whom 18,337 are females. The principal Brahman sub-divisions found in this parganah are the Gaur (3,786), Ach\u00e1rs, Dakaut and Bharaddhwaj. The Baniyas belong to the Agarw\u00e1l (1,714), Sarangi (206), Bishnoi, Goyel, G\u00e1t\u00e1, Sangal and Dasa divisions. The other castes are for the most part the same as those noticed under the R\u00farki parganah. Those castes having more than one thousand members in this parganah are the Kumb\u00e1r, 1,077; Kah\u00e1r, 2,818; Cham\u00e1r, 18,158; Kh\u00e1krob, 1,535; G\u00fajar, 6,615; Barhai, 1,236; Garariya, 1,048; Saini, 1,790; and J\u00e1t, 4,344. The Musalm\u00e1ns are returned under Shaikhs (435), converted Pundirs and Chauh\u00e1ns (447), and Path\u00e1ns (1,436); the remainder are entered without distinction. The principal landholders are G\u00fajars, J\u00e1ts, Kalw\u00e1rs, Shaikhz\u00e9dahs, Jhojas, and Mah\u00e9jans.\nThe occupations of the people are shown in the statistics collected at the census of 1872. From these it appears that of the male adult population (not less than fifteen years of age), 746 are employed in professional avocations, such as Government servants, priests, doctors, and the like; 2,894 in domestic service, as personal servants, water-carriers, barbers, sweepers, washermen, &c.; 1,491 in commerce, in buying, selling, keeping or lending money or goods, or the conveyance of men, animals, or goods; 7,762 in agricultural operations; 4,178 in industrial occupations, arts and mechanics, and the preparation of all classes of substances, vegetable, mineral, and animal. There were 4,935 persons returned as labourers, and 480 as of no specified occupation. Taking the total population, irrespective of age or sex, the same returns give 583 as landholders, 21,165 as cultivators, and 44,994 as engaged in occupations unconnected with agriculture. The educational statistics, which are confessedly imperfect, show 1,128 males as able to read and write out of a total male population numbering 36,590 souls.\n\nManglaur is an old Akbari parganah. It remained unchanged until 1842, and gave a land revenue in 1840-41 of Rs. 62,607. In 1842 it received villages assessed at Rs. 21,002, and villages assessed at Rs. 2,781 were transferred to other parganahs. Five villages were handed over to the Muzaffarnagar district, and five were received from parganah Nurnagar (now Gordhanpur). In 1855 considerable changes took place, which are shown in the following table:\n\n| Parganah | Villages | Area in acres | Revenue | Population | Parganah | Villages | Area in acres | Revenue | Population |\n|----------|----------|---------------|---------|------------|----------|----------|---------------|---------|------------|\n| Transferred to Bhagwanpur | 19 | 4,754 | 9,715 | 4,601 | Jaufal | 28 | 11,265 | 11,168 | 7,804 |\n| Received from Burki | 24 | 13,232 | 17,196 | 16,236 | Deoband | 9 | 785 | 985 | 226 |\n| Total in 1855 | 145 | 77,401 | 94,642 | 69,801 |\n\nMASKHARA, a river which rises directly in the Kaluwala pass in the Siwalik hills. Like most of the other hill streams, the bed is sandy, the fall is rapid, and, except in the rains, it is dry. The Maskhara is fed by three other streams rising in the same hills, viz., the Kalkar, Jaitpur, and Sansara Baos. When the opening of the Eastern Jumna Canal was determined on, cuts were made from the Maskhara in three places, by which its surplus waters were led into the Chafaha, Nagdeo, and Dumanla, the head-waters of the Hindan.\n\nMUZAFFARABAD, a parganah of the Saharanpur tahsil, is bounded on the north by the Siwaliks; on the west, by the Faizabad parganah; on the east, by Bhagwanpur; and on the\nsouth, by parganahs Saharanpur and Haraura. According to the census of 1872, parganah Muzaffarabad had a total area of 202 square miles, of which 78 square miles were under cultivation. The area assessed to Government revenue during the same year was 105 square miles, of which 78 square miles were cultivated, 14 square miles were culturable, and 13 square miles were barren. The northern portion of the parganah is similar to the neighbouring parganah of Faizabad, and much covered with forest. Four hill torrents intersect the parganah, two of which (the Barkala and Sahasrao) join the Maskhara, which falls into the Jumna; a third joins the Hindan, and a fourth falls into the Solani, a feeder of the Ganges, just below Kheri. The last two contain water during the greater part of the year, and the estates on their banks have moist khaddir lands. There is very little irrigation, and in the greater portion of the parganah earthen wells cannot be constructed, as water is found only at a great depth (100 to 150 feet) below the surface, and the soil contains a large proportion of stones and boulders. Those at present in existence are chiefly used for domestic purposes and for watering cattle. The beds of the canal distributaries, even in the south of the parganah, are too low to admit of their supplying the means of irrigation to any large extent. The rabi crops form 56 per cent. of the total cultivation, and but little sugar-cane cultivation is seen.\n\nThe last year of the settlement made by Mr. Thornton in 1839 showed a land revenue of Rs. 41,948, and this was raised to Rs. 43,556 by Mr. VanAgnew. Mr. H. Robertson revised the latter assessment, and proposed a revenue of Rs. 57,095 on a total area amounting to 51,621 acres, of which 42,924 acres were assessed to land revenue, and of these 33,967 acres were cultivated. The actual land revenue for 1872 amounted to Rs. 64,465 (or with cesses, Rs. 71,006), falling at a rate of Re. 0-8-0 per British acre on the total area, at Re. 0-15-4 per acre on the area assessed to Government revenue, and at Re. 1-4-8 per acre on the cultivated area. The sum paid by cultivators to the landowners as rent and cesses during the same year has been estimated at Rs. 1,14,949.\n\nThe parganah may be divided into two very distinct tracts, varying materially in the character of their soils and the facilities that they possess for irrigation. The northern portion, comprising about one-third of the total area, has the dark chocolate-coloured alluvial soil noticed under the Faizabad parganah, whilst the portion lying nearest the hills is often altogether valueless, owing to the thinness of this layer of soil. The depth of the spring-level, too, is a great hindrance to cultivation, though this is partially counterbalanced by the great rainfall, here averaging about 60 inches per annum. With the exception of a few estates in the valley of the Solani, the remainder of the parganah is covered with a rich raushi soil.\noccasionally intermixed with sand, but, as a whole, productive of luxuriant crops, and rendered still more valuable by its participation in the high rain-fall of the submontane tracts. The water here, too, is only from 10 to 18 feet from the surface, and well-irrigation is easy. In the cultivated area, first class soil (misam) forms fifteen per cent., and the worst soil (bhada) only nine per cent. of the whole.\n\nBetween the years 1839-40 and 1859-60 six whole villages and 29 portions of villages, having an area of 7,540 acres, and paying a revenue of Rs. 5,752, and valued at Rs. 46,234, were transferred by private arrangement in this parganah. The transfers by decree of Court comprised 28 portions of villages, having an aggregate area of 5,805 acres, and paying a revenue of Rs. 4,067. The value recorded was Rs. 19,625. Out of the 32 whole and 38 portions of villages remaining with the original proprietors, 4,315 acres, bearing a revenue of Rs. 2,652, valued at Rs. 18,000, of the former, and 4,923 acres, bearing a revenue of Rs. 2,913, valued at Rs. 47,265, of the latter, were under mortgage. These statistics give a percentage of private transfers to the total area of 14 per cent., of transfers by decree of Court amounting to 11 per cent., and transfers by mortgage amounting to 23 per cent. The average value in each of these cases was Rs. 6-2-1, Rs. 3-6-1 and Rs. 7-4-4, and the land revenue assessed amounted to Re. 0-12-2, Re. 0-11-2, and Re. 0-10-0 per acre, respectively. The result from the entire parganah on 48 per cent. of the total area gives an average value of Rs. 5-13-7 per acre when the average land revenue amounted to Re. 0-11-4 per acre. Shaikhs, Garas, Brahmins and Hindu Rajputs were the principal losers, but still retain 3, 1, 16 and 6 entire villages, respectively, besides shares in others.\n\nAccording to the census of 1872, parganah Muzaffarabad contained 136 inhabited villages, of which 62 had less than 200 inhabitants; 42 had between 200 and 500; 26 had between 500 and 1,000; 5 had between 1,000 and 2,000; and one had between 2,000 and 3,000. At the settlement there were 98 estates, of which three were held free of revenue, and fifteen were jungle grants. The total population in 1872 numbered 37,078 souls (21,020 females), giving 229 to the square mile. Classified according to religion, there were 33,809 Hindus, of whom 15,222 were females, and 12,469 Musalmans, amongst whom 5,798 were females. Distributing the Hindu population amongst the four great classes, the census shows 1,443 Brahmins, of whom 614 were females; 1,425 Rajputs, including 564 females; 968 Baniyas (398 females); whilst the great mass of the population is included in \"the other castes\" of the census returns, which show a total of 29,973 souls, of whom 13,646 are females. The principal Brahman subdivisions found in this parganah are the Gaur (1,331), and Achhraj. The Rajputs show members of the Pundir (746), Khagi, Polast and Chandrabansi.\nclans, and the Baniyas are chiefly Agarwals (634), Sarangis, Garge, Goyels and Maithilas. The other castes are for the most part the same as those given under the notice of the Haraura parganah. Kah\u00e1rs number 2,072 souls; Cham\u00e1rs, 11,777; Sainis, 3,469; Kambohs, 1,339; and Banj\u00e1ras, 2,909. Of the 80 estates paying revenue to Government, there are 39 which belong to the same class of proprietors, viz., 22 to Mah\u00e1jans, 10 to Rajp\u00fats, 5 to G\u00e1r\u00e1s, and 2 to Brahmans. The cultivators are chiefly Sainis and G\u00e1r\u00e1s. The Musalm\u00e1ns comprise Shaikhs (295), converted Pundirs (44), Path\u00e1ns (1,154), converted Rajp\u00fats (846), and Musalm\u00e1n G\u00fajars (703); the remainder are entered without distinction.\n\nThe occupations of the people are shown in the statistics collected at the census of 1872. From these it appears that of the male adult population (not less than fifteen years of age) 156 are employed in professional avocations, such as Government servants, priests, doctors, and the like; 1,211 in domestic service, as personal servants, water-carriers, barbers, sweepers, washermen, &c.; 796 in commerce, in buying, selling, keeping or lending money or goods, or the conveyance of men, animals, or goods; 6,552 in agricultural operations; 1,671 in industrial occupations, arts and mechanics, and the preparation of all classes of substances, vegetable, mineral, and animal. There were 4,249 persons returned as labourers, and 309 as of no specified occupation. Taking the total population, irrespective of age or sex, the same returns give 812 as landholders, 9,419 as cultivators and 26,847 as engaged in occupations unconnected with agriculture. The educational statistics, which are confessedly imperfect, show 79 males as able to read and write out of a total male population numbering 25,258 souls.\n\nMuzafrabad is one of the old Akbari parganahs. In 1840-41 the land revenue stood at Rs. 37,375; by transfers in 1841-42 there was an increase of Rs. 19,685, and a decrease of Rs. 8,047, leaving a revenue of Rs. 49,013. The next changes took place in 1855, and are shown below:\n\n| Transferred to | Received from |\n|---------------|--------------|\n| Names of parganahs | No. of villages | Area in acres | Land revenue | Population |\n| Haraura | 63 | 29,975 | 30,495 | 23,367 |\n| Sah\u00e1ranpur | 4 | 1,767 | 2,098 | 860 |\n| Bhagw\u00e1npur | 17 | 18,974 | 7,489 | 6,929 |\n| Sarasawa | 1 | 108 | 50 | ... |\n| Total | 63 | 49,970 | 30,117 | 21,855 |\n\n| Names of parganahs | No. of villages | Area in acres | Land revenue | Population |\n|-------------------|----------------|---------------|--------------|-------------|\n| Sah\u00e1ranpur | 6 | 5,716 | 4,660 | 2,310 |\n| Bah\u00e1t | 57 | 44,364 | 35,357 | 19,545 |\n| Balance | 96 | 77,674 | 44,925 | 43,762 |\nN\u00c1GAL, a village in the parganah of the same name in the Sah\u00e1ranpur district, is distant 10 miles from Sah\u00e1ranpur. The population in 1872 numbered 586 souls. N\u00e1gal is a small unimportant place on the line of march from Meerut to Landour, distant 11\u00bd miles from the previous station (Deoband), and 17 miles from the next station (Fatehpur). Supplies are only procurable after notice, and the encamping-ground is confined. From Deoband the country is well wooded and fairly cultivated; the road is a second-class raised and bridged but unmetalled road; it is rather heavy, and passes Saisara at 7\u00bd miles, and Barsara at 9\u00bd miles. From hence to Fatehpur you cross the R\u00farki and Sah\u00e1ranpur road at 6\u00bd miles, pass Haraura at 10\u00bd miles, a village where water and supplies are plentiful; road for the rest of the way is metalled. There is a third-class police-station and branch post-office here.\n\nN\u00c1GAL, a parganah in tahsil Deoband of the Sah\u00e1ranpur district, is bounded\n\nArea. on the north by the Haraura parganah; on the east by Bhagw\u00e1npur and Manglaur; on the south by Deoband; and on the west by R\u00e1mpur. According to the census of 1872 this parganah had then a total area of 122 square miles, of which 99 square miles were under cultivation. The area assessed to Government revenue during the same year was 121 square miles, of which 99 square miles were cultivated, 11 square miles were culturable, and 11 square miles were barren. To the west lies a small strip of the old K\u00e1tha parganah, and next to it that lying along the Hindan, and containing much bad bh\u00e1da. To the east of this, a tract of good land runs down the centre of the parganah, and this is succeeded by a very scantily irrigated tract in the Du\u00e1b between the heads of the K\u00e1li Nadi. The villages in the first two groups resemble those similarly situated in the Deoband parganah, except that in the K\u00e1tha portion irrigation is impracticable, and in the Hindan villages the kh\u00e9din is much richer and better than in Deoband. The cultivators are for the most part G\u00e1r\u00e1s, Tagas and Kol\u00eds. In the central plateau there is much irrigation, and fine sugar-cane of the dhaut\u00ed species is produced. The proprietors and cultivators are chiefly Tagas and Kol\u00eds, supposed to be a branch of the J\u00e1t caste. In the villages adjoining the heads of the K\u00e1li river the soil is light, the surface undulating, and the sub-soil is not retentive of moisture. In the remainder of this group the soil is good, with a very fair sub-soil. Irrigation is scanty, and there are few wells, so that if the sub-soil were bad, there would be scarcely any crop to be found here in a season of drought. Water is to be found at 17 feet from the surface in the Western Du\u00e1b, and at 21 feet in the Eastern Du\u00e1b, which is in all respects the inferior of the two. The population over the whole area is very thin.\n\nAt the close of the last settlement the land revenue stood at Rs. 1,07,444; this was increased by Mr. Vans Agnew to Rs. 1,04,746. Mr. Wynne then undertook the revision of Mr. Vans-\nAgnew's settlement, and fixed the assessment at Rs. 1,00,860 on a total area then amounting to 77,539 acres, of which 70,240 acres were assessed to Government revenue, and of these 61,316 acres were under cultivation at the time of settlement. The actual land revenue for 1872 amounted to Rs. 91,713 (or with cesses, Rs. 1,00,926), falling at a rate of Re. 1-2-10 per British acre on the total area, at Re. 1-2-11 per acre on the area assessed to Government revenue, and at Re. 1-7-2 per acre on the cultivated area. The sum paid by cultivators to the landowners as rent and cesses during the same year has been estimated at Rs. 1,44,724.\n\nBetween the years 1839-40 and 1859-60, two whole villages and 71 portions of villages, having an area of 5,583 acres, and paying a revenue of Rs. 9,913, and valued at Rs. 36,922, were transferred by private arrangement in this parganah. The transfers by decree of Court comprised 90 portions of villages, having an aggregate area of 9,410 acres, and paying a revenue of Rs. 16,395. The value recorded was Rs. 61,624. Out of the 20 whole and 97 portions of villages remaining with the original proprietors, 391 acres, bearing a revenue of Rs. 587, valued at Rs. 3,412, of the former, and 3,736 acres, having a revenue of Rs. 6,854, valued at Rs. 28,159, of the latter, were under mortgage. These statistics give a percentage of private transfers to the total area of 7 per cent., of transfers by decree of Court amounting to 12 per cent., and of transfers by mortgage amounting to 5 per cent. The average value per acre in each of these cases was Rs. 6-9-9, Rs. 5-8-0 and Rs. 7-10-0, and the land revenue assessed amounted to Re. 1-12-4, Re. 1-12-0 and Re. 1-13-0 per acre, respectively. The result from the entire parganah on 24 per cent. of the total area gives an average value of Rs. 6-5-0 per acre when the average land revenue amounted to Re. 1-12-0 per acre. Gujars and Tagas were the principal losers, but they still retain ten entire villages amongst them.\n\nAccording to the census of 1872, parganah N\u00e9gal contained 110 inhabited villages, of which 34 had less than 200 inhabitants; 34 had between 200 and 500; 26 had between 500 and 1,000; 14 had between 1,000 and 2,000; and two had between 2,000 and 3,000. The settlement records show that there were 123 estates in this parganah, of which one was held free of revenue in perpetuity. The total population in 1872 numbered 54,537 souls (24,159 females), giving 447 to the square mile. Classified according to religion, there were 43,854 Hindus, of whom 19,304 were females; 10,680 Musalm\u00e1ns, amongst whom 4,855 were females; and there were three Christians. Distributing the Hindu population amongst the four great classes, the census shows 4,171 Brahmans, of whom 1,894 were females; 1,774 Rajputs, including 633 females; 1,358 Baniyas (587 females); whilst the great mass of the population is included in \"the other castes\" of the\nSAHARANPUR DISTRICT.\n\ncensus returns, which show a total of 36,561 souls, of whom 16,190 are females. The principal Brahman sub-divisions found in this parganah are the Gaur (4,011) and Saraswat. The Rajputs belong to the Pundir (1,631) and Solankhi clans, and the Baniyas to the Agarwal (846), Sarangi and Gal\u00e1 divisions. The other castes are for the most part the same as those mentioned under the notice of the Rampur parganah. Those having more than one thousand members in this parganah are as follow:\u2014Kah\u00e1r, 2,649; Cham\u00e1r, 10,579; Kh\u00e1krob, 1,655; Guj\u00e1r, 3,917; Koli, 2,901; Saini, 2,503; and Taga, 3,025. The Musalmans include Shaikhs (384), converted Pundirs (49), other Rajputs (845), and Pathans (113); the remainder are entered without distinction. The principal landowners are G\u00e1rs, Rajputs, Tagas, Kolias, Mahajans, Brahmins, Gujar\u00e1s, Jats, Ahirs and Rangars.\n\nThe occupations of the people are shown in the statistics collected at the census of 1872. From these it appears that of the male adult population (not less than fifteen years of age) 658 are employed in professional avocations, such as Government servants, priests, doctors, and the like; 2,065 in domestic service, as personal servants, water-carriers, barbers, sweepers, washermen, &c.; 873 in commerce, in buying, selling, keeping or lending money or goods, or the conveyance of men, animals, or goods; 8,588 in agricultural operations; 2,944 in industrial occupations, arts and mechanics, and the preparation of all classes of substances, vegetable, mineral, and animal. There were 3,023 persons returned as labourers, and 421 as of no specified occupation. Taking the total population, irrespective of age or sex, the same returns give 12,921 as landholders, 10,831 as cultivators, and 31,085 as engaged in occupations unconnected with agriculture. The educational statistics, which are confessedly imperfect, show 187 males as able to read and write out of a total male population numbering 30,378 souls.\n\nThe N\u00e1g\u00e1l parganah is a modern creation, having been formed from the neighbouring parganahs in 1855, when 118 villages, having an area of 72,365 acres, assessed at Rs. 94,069, and with a population of 48,713 souls, were received from Deoband, and nine villages, with an area of 7,268 acres, and assessed at Rs. 7,870, were received from K\u00e1tha, with a population of 4,526 souls. This made the area in 1855 amount to 79,633 acres, with a revenue of Rs. 1,01,939, and a population numbering 53,239 souls.\n\nNak\u00far or N\u00e1kur, the chief town of the parganah and tahsil of the same name in the Saharanpur district, is distant 16 miles from the town of Saharanpur, and has an area of 170 bighas. The population in 1865 was 4,535, and in 1872 numbered 4,493 souls, chiefly Sarangis and Baniyas. Nak\u00far is said to have been founded by N\u00e1kula, one of the P\u00e1ndavas, after whom it was called N\u00e1kul, and finally Nak\u00far. It has a tahsil\u00ed, a first-class police-station, a branch\npost-office, a Government school, and a dispensary. The site is well raised on the eastern border of a large jhil, and is furnished with well-made and metalled ways, drained by saucer drains and lined by shops with ornamental fronts. The drainage runs towards the jhil, which extends for a great distance as a sheet of stagnant water with muddy margins, and is much used for rice cultivation; on the north and east there are mango groves, but the other sides are bare. The water in the wells in the centre and highest parts of the town is 35 feet from the surface, in the lower outskirts it rises to 32 feet. There is a fine Jain temple here, and the school-house, tahsildari, dispensary and sarasi are all well built and cleanly kept places. Act XX. of 1856 (the Chaukidari Act) is in force, and supports a village police of eight men, at an annual cost of Rs. 432, besides a staff of eleven sweepers.\\(^1\\) The total income from all sources in 1872-73 amounted to Rs. 2,005, giving an incidence of Re. 0-6-7 per head of the population, and Re. 1-12-11 per house. A portion of this was expended during the same year in paving and draining the town. Nakur originally formed a part of the jagir of the Sikh Sardar, Rai Singh. There is hardly any trade, and the town has a dilapidated look, but not nearly to so great an extent as Gangoh or Lakhnauti.\n\nNakur suffered severely during the mutiny. On the 20th June, 1857, it was burned by a party of Gujars before the force sent for its relief could arrive. This force, however, succeeded in recovering a portion of the plunder from the inhabitants of Fatehpur, and in punishing a body of Gujars who tried to show fight. All the town, with the exception of the Muhammadan quarter, where the police took refuge, was plundered. The police did nothing to resist the plunderers, and the Government offices were burned to the ground. Ghatampur and several other villages in the neighbourhood of Ambahata were the principals in these disturbances, and, under the leadership of Bakshi and Fatua, Gujars, continued for some time to give much trouble.\n\n**Area.**\n\nAccording to the census of 1872 Nakur had a total area of 109 square miles, of which 73 square miles were under cultivation. The area assessed to Government revenue during the same year was 96 square miles, of which 71 square miles were cultivated, 17 square miles were culturable, and 8 square miles were barren. The same division of villages into groups for assessment purposes was made here as in Sarsawa. The villages of the first or canal-irrigated group are better according as they lie towards the south, and worse as they lie towards the\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) See Cutcliffe's Report, Appendix A., xiii.\nnorth. The northern villages are much intersected by the drainage channels from the Kumh\u00e1rh\u00e9ra jhil, and many of the lands in the centre and south have a slope towards the K\u00e1tha N\u00e1la. Nearly two-thirds of the cultivated area in this group is irrigated either from canals or wells, and produces fine crops of wheat, rice and sugar-cane. Water is on an average only eight feet from the surface.\n\nIn the second group, comprising the remainder of the upland villages, with the exception of six villages owned by Path\u00e1ns, and a few of which the Pirz\u00e1dahs of Ambahta are proprietors, the entire proprietary body are G\u00fajars, who cultivate their own lands. They are not so industrious as their brethren in Sult\u00e1npur, and approximate more to the turbulent character of the G\u00fajars of Gangoh. In the third group of mixed upland and lowland villages the G\u00fajars hold all except six villages, and are here particularly indolent and improvident. In the uplands the soil is very poor, and in many places almost worthless, and in the kh\u00e1dir the soil to the north is light, but very stiff indeed to the south. Water is found at a depth of 22 feet from the surface, but the sub-soil is very irretentive of moisture, and earthen wells seldom last more than a year and-a-half. No crop grows well in any but a few detached spots in this group, and this poorness of soil may possibly account for the carelessness and improvidence shown by the G\u00fajar inhabitants. In the fourth group or kh\u00e1dir villages, the G\u00fajar element is not so strong. There are a number of J\u00e9t villages in the north, and several villages owned by Sayyids in the south. Water is found at a depth of eleven feet from the surface, but earthen wells hardly last six months, and brick-built wells are so expensive, that well-irrigation is scanty, and there is none from canals.\n\nThe last year's land revenue of Mr. E. Thornton's settlement amounted to Rs. 60,967, which was increased to Rs. 65,262 by Mr. VansAgnew. Mr. Wynne revised this settlement, and proposed an assessment amounting to Rs. 73,143 on a total area of 68,781 acres, of which 57,791 acres were assessed to revenue, and of these 44,995 acres were cultivated. The actual land revenue for 1872 amounted to Rs. 66,119 (or with cesses, Rs. 73,550), falling at a rate of Re. 0-15-2 per British acre on the total area, at Re. 1-1-3 per acre on the area assessed to Government revenue, and at Re. 1-6-5 per acre on the cultivated area. The sum paid by cultivators to the landowners as rent and cesses during the same year has been estimated at Rs. 97,027.\n\nBetween the years 1839-40 and 1859-60, forty-three portions of villages, having an area of 2,857 acres, and paying a revenue of Rs. 3,468, and valued at Rs. 25,080, were transferred by private arrangement in this parganah. The transfers by decree of Court comprised one entire village and 73 portions of villages, having an aggregate area of 5,267 acres, and paying a revenue of Rs. 6,477. The value recorded was\nRs. 24,317. Out of the 38 whole and 94 portions of villages remaining with the original proprietors, 116 acres, bearing a revenue of Rs. 187, valued at Rs. 1,401, of the former, and 2,365 acres, bearing a revenue of Rs. 3,088, valued at Rs. 29,486, of the latter, were under mortgage. These statistics give a percentage of private transfers to the total area of four per cent., of transfers by decree of Court amounting to seven per cent., and of transfers by mortgage amounting to three per cent. The average value per acre in each of these cases was Rs. 8-12-0, Rs. 4-9-10 and Rs. 12-7-0, and the land revenue assessed amounted to Re. 1-3-4, Re. 1-3-8 and Re. 1-5-0 per acre, respectively. The result from the entire parganah on 14 per cent. of the total area gives an average value of Rs. 10-9-1 per acre when the average land revenue amounted to Re. 1-4-0 per acre. The principal losers were G\u00fajars and J\u00e1ts, but the former still retain 24 entire villages, and the latter hold six.\n\nAccording to the census of 1872, parganah Nak\u00far contained 103 inhabited villages, of which 40 had less than 200 inhabitants; 35 had between 200 and 500; 21 had between 500 and 1,000; three had between 1,000 and 2,000; two had between 2,000 and 3,000; and one had between 3,000 and 5,000. The settlement records show 136 estates in the parganah, of which three are held free of revenue in perpetuity. The total population in 1872 numbered 50,590 souls (22,636 females), giving 464 to the square mile. Classified according to religion, there were 35,912 Hind\u00fas, of whom 15,603 were females; 14,677 Musalm\u00e1ns, amongst whom 7,033 were females; and there was one Christian. Distributing the Hind\u00fa population amongst the four great classes, the census shows 2,840 Brahmans, of whom 1,321 were females; nine Rajputs; 2,973 Baniyas (1,376 females); whilst the great mass of the population is included in \"the other castes\" of the census returns, which show a total of 30,090 souls, of whom 12,903 are females. The principal Brahman sub-division found in this parganah is the Gaur (2,533). The Baniyas belong to the Agarw\u00e1l (2,148) and Sarangi (413) sub-divisions. The other castes are for the most part the same as those found in the Sult\u00e1npur parganah, and there noticed. Kumh\u00e1rs number 1,172 souls, Kah\u00e1rs, 2,246; Cham\u00e1rs, 5,778; Kh\u00e1krobs, 2,234; G\u00fajars, 7,332; Barhais, 1,132; M\u00e1l\u00eds, 2,494; and J\u00e1ts, 1,981. The Musalm\u00e1ns comprise Shaikhs (1,182), converted Pundirs (996), and Path\u00e1ns (2,120); the remainder are entered without distinction. The landholders are chiefly G\u00fajars, Sayyids, J\u00e1ts, Mah\u00e1jans and Path\u00e1ns.\n\nThe occupations of the people are shown in the statistics collected at the census of 1872. From these it appears that, of the male adult population (not less than fifteen years of age), 310 are employed in professional avocations, such as Government servants, priests, doctors, and the like; 2,206 in domestic service, as personal servants, water-carriers, barbers, sweepers, washermen, &c.; 1,105 in commerce, in\nSAHARANPUR DISTRICT.\n\nbuying, selling, keeping or lending money or goods, or the conveyance of men, animals, or goods; 8,094 in agricultural operations; 2,707 in industrial occupations, arts and mechanics, and the preparation of all classes of substances, vegetable, mineral, and animal. There were 2,352 persons returned as labourers, and 476 as of no specified occupation. Taking the total population irrespective of age or sex, the same returns give 1,076 as landholders, 19,881 as cultivators, and 29,633 as engaged in occupations unconnected with agriculture. The educational statistics, which are confessedly imperfect, show eight males as able to read and write out of a total male population numbering 27,954 souls.\n\nNakur is one of the old Akbari parganahs. In 1840-41 it yielded a land revenue of Rs. 43,385. In the following year, villages assessed at Rs. 17,142 were received from the neighbouring parganahs, and villages assessed at Rs. 4,963 were transferred. The changes that took place in 1855 are shown in the following table:\n\n| Name of Parganah | No. of Villages | Area in acres | Land Revenue | Population |\n|------------------|----------------|---------------|--------------|------------|\n| Saraswa          | 48             | 22,934        | 21,859       | 10,456     |\n| Gangoh           | 1              | 311           | 435          | -158       |\n| Saharanpur       | 2              | 1,737         | 2,038        | 1,885      |\n\nThis left the parganah in 1855 with 135 villages, containing 70,347 acres, and assessed at Rs. 63,193.\n\nNAKUR, a tahsil in the Saharanpur district, comprises the parganahs of Nakur, Gangoh, Saraswa and Sultanpur. The total area according to the census of 1872 contains 423 square miles, of which 286 square miles are cultivated. The area assessed to Government revenue is given at 394 square miles, of which 278 square miles are cultivated, 77 square miles are culturable, and 39 square miles are barren. The land revenue during the same year stood at Rs. 2,62,787 (or with cesses, Rs. 2,90,498), falling at Re. 0-15-6 per on the total area, Re. 1-0-8 per acre on the area assessed to Government revenue, and Rs. 2 acre on the cultivated area. The population numbered 189,022 souls (85,569 females), giving 447 to the square mile, distributed amongst 405 villages. The same statistics show one person an idiot, five deaf and dumb, 107 blind, and 12 lepers in the tahsil. The tahsil comprises the four parganahs along the Jumna, each\nof which possess a portion of the kh\u0101d\u012bs, on an average about four miles from the river bank. Then comes a high bank, often much cut up by ravines; and beyond this the uplands proper. All other matters connected with the tahsil will be found in the district notice, or separately under each parganah.\n\nN\u0101nauta, an old Akbari parganah of the Sah\u0101ranpur district, yielded a revenue of Rs. 28,139 in 1840-41. In the following year it was broken up and distributed amongst the parganahs of R\u0101mpur and Gangoh in the Sah\u0101ranpur district, and amongst parganahs Jhanjh\u0101na and Th\u0101n\u0113 Bhawan in the Muzaffarnagar district.\n\nN\u0101nauta, a village in parganah R\u0101mpur of the Sah\u0101ranpur district, is distant six miles south from R\u0101mpur and 20 miles from the civil station. The population in 1872 numbered 4,887, for the most part Musalm\u0101ns. The site is well raised, but surrounded by water-holes and irrigation channels, which assist the growth of numerous groves, in which the trees have a very dense foliage. The water in the wells stands at fifteen feet from the surface in the hot weather, and at ten feet in the rains. Out of the twelve wells in the village, the water in ten is brackish, and some of these have an oily substance floating on the top. The zam\u012bnd\u0101rs are an ill-conditioned lot of Path\u0101ns, Sayyids and Shaikhs; and the money-lenders resident here have also a bad name. The Shaikhs are descended from one M\u012bran Bar\u0101. Their former prosperity and orthodoxy were such as to attract the Sikhs from the Panj\u0101b, who so often visited and plundered N\u0101nauta that it obtained the name of \u2018Jal\u0101shahr\u2019 and \u2018Kh\u0101tashahr\u2019 amongst the peasantry. The name N\u0101nauta is said to have been given by the founder N\u0101nu, a Gujar chief, who was subsequently expelled by R\u0101ja R\u0101m of R\u0101mpur. There is a second class police-station, a village school, and a district post-office here. Act XX. of 1856 is in force, and in 1873 supported a village police numbering eight men of all ranks, at an annual cost of Rs. 450, besides six public sweepers. The total income from all sources in 1872-73 amounted to Rs. 1,355, giving an incidence of Re. 0-4-3 per head of the population, and Re. 1-4-0 per house. A project for draining the town has been taken in hand in connection with the Krishni Nadi works. The village is clean and fairly well kept, but the people suffer much from fever (see Cutcliffe\u2019s report, Appendix A., XXII.)\n\nNojli, a station of the Great Trigonometrical Survey in the Sah\u0101ranpur district, in latitude 29\u00b0-53\u2032-28\u2033, and longitude 77\u00b0-42\u2032-52\u2033, has an elevation of 929\u2032 feet above the level of the sea. The upper markstone of the survey station lies 0\u20324 miles to the south of the village of Nojli, one mile south of Pundir, and one mile south-west of Bar\u0101pur. This height is deduced trigonometrically.\n\nPaniyala, a village in parganah Bhagw\u0101napur of the Sah\u0101ranpur district, is distant 20 miles from the civil station. The population in 1872 numbered 2,271 souls, consisting principally of Brahmans and Baniyas. The houses, with one exception, are built of mud, and in number are about 520. There is a\nsmall bazar lined with shops, and seven brick wells, with water only eight feet from the surface. The site is well raised, but on the east is a large water-hole, three-fourths of a mile long and 600 yards wide, containing water at all seasons. This was excavated to make bricks for the Ganges Canal, which flows some three miles east of Paniyala. West of the large hole are some jhut-like places of smaller extent. To the west of the site are some fine mango groves, and beyond them the Sila Nadi. Fever prevailed here in 1870-71, and cattle disease was very fatal in 1871. Paniyala is a thriving little place, and now absorbs most of the grain of the neighbourhood.\n\nPatehar, a taluka of the Saharanpur district, was separated from Sultanpur Bahat in the time of Najib Khan, Rohilla, by an Afghan follower named Anwar Khan. It continued to form a separate tappa up to 1842, when it was distributed between Sultanpur and Faizabad. Patehar lay between the Eastern Jumna Canal, the Maskhara stream, and the Jumna. It formed the mukarasi of Murtaza Khan, and comprised only 31 villages. The settlement from 1813-14 was made with village zemindars, and before its absorption (in 1840-41) amounted to Rs. 16,227.\n\nRajapur, a large village in parganah Deoband of the Saharanpur district, is distant 19 miles from the civil station. The population in 1872 numbered 2,773 souls; in 1865 there were 36,028 inhabitants, chiefly Musalmans Sheikhs. Rajapur contains 611 houses, of which 218 are brick-built, and of these, three or four fine houses belong to Baniyas. There is a good bazar containing forty shops; nine brick-built wells and a good masjid. The site is well raised on the eastern border of the Sila lowlands, which are cultivated as vegetable gardens by Malis, who occupy some sixty houses in the village. The water in the wells has risen to ten feet from the surface since the introduction of canal irrigation, and has changed very much in taste for the worse. During 1869-71 fever was epidemic here and very fatal: 98 persons died in 1869, 122 died in 1870, 98 died in 1871, and even in 1874 fever was very prevalent.\n\nRampur, a town in parganah Hampur of the Saharanpur district, is distant 14 miles from Saharanpur on the old Delhi road, and 13\u00bd miles from Jalalabad in the Muzaffarnagar district. The population in 1853 numbered 6,566 souls, which increased to 8,464 in 1865. In 1872 there were 8,234 inhabitants, of whom 4,157 were Hindus (1,922 females), and 4,077 were Musalmans (1,953 females), chiefly Garas. The site is rather low and almost level, and the houses are crowded together. The lanes are narrow and uneven. Some of the houses are brick-built and have fine fronts, especially those inhabited by the Jain Baniyas known as Sarangie in the upper Doab, who carry on a good grain trade. They have recently built a fine temple with a gilt spire. A metalled and drained road runs through the town. The bazar has been metalled and the streets have been paved, and a scheme for the drainage is under consideration in connec-\ntion with the Karuni Nadi project. The town looks well from a distance, owing to the numerous groves which surround it and the gardens within it. The water in the principal well is found at a depth of 20 feet from the surface, and in many of the wells is somewhat brackish. Supplies are plentiful. Act XX. of 1856 (the Chaukidari Act) is in force, and in 1872 supported a village police numbering 16 men, at an annual cost of Rs. 882, besides a staff of six public sweepers. The total income from all sources in 1872-73 amounted to Rs. 3,715, giving an incidence of Re. 0-6-2 per head of the population, and Re. 1-9-6 per house. During the same year, Rs. 2,609 were expended on works of public improvement connected with the town. Rampur is said to have been founded by one Raja Ram, and, like Deoband, is believed to have been captured by Salar Masaid. The town is noted for the manufacture of glass bangles, which keeps six large ovens at work. There is a good parganah school, a first class police-station, and a branch post-office. An urs or religious fair is held in June at the tomb of Sheikh Ibrahim Pir, which attracts a large assemblage. (See Cutcliffe's Report, Appendix A., XV.)\n\nRampur, a parganah of the Deoband tahsil in the Saharanpur district, is bounded on the north by parganah Saharanpur; on the west by Nakur and Gangoh; on the east by Nagal and Deoband; and on the south by the Muzaffarnagar district.\n\nAccording to the census of 1872, parganah Rampur had a total area of 129 square miles, of which 101 square miles were under cultivation. The area assessed to Government revenue during the same year was 124 square miles, of which 98 square miles were cultivated, 15 square miles were culturable, and 11 square miles were barren. The parganah is intersected by the Jumna Canal on the west, and the Krishni Nadi on the east, both of which have a course from north to south.\n\nNatural divisions. The drainage of the tract lying to the west of Rampur itself is carried off along the bed of the old canal until it collects near Anantmanu, whence it is taken by the Andauli cut into the Katha; that of the tract to the south of this, and about Nanauta, is carried off by another cut into the Krishni on the east, whilst in the extreme south-west a cut leads the superfluous moisture collected in the old canal by Titron into the Katha. Between the Hindan and the Krishni a small drainage line carries off the superfluous moisture from Umri southwards. The Hindan flows along the extreme north-eastern boundary, separating this parganah from Nagal. Rampur is still the most water-logged portion of the district, and therefore the most unhealthy and its reclamation forms a portion of the Krishni Nadi scheme. Near the banks of the Hindan there is some low land which grows wheat without irrigation. On the west there is a little sandy land, but beyond, the soil is a stiff clay, which, when irrigated, yields rice and sugar-cane, and in the rabi, wheat.\nPortions of the parganah near Anantmau and Banhera have become so indurated by continuous submersion, that unless irrigated they would not produce any crops. In the south-east lies the tract known as the K\u0101tha, which formerly composed a separate parganah. It is owned and cultivated by Rajp\u016bt Pundirs almost exclusively as R\u0101mpur proper is in the hands of Gtijars. The soil here is particularly good and very retentive of moisture, but it is not adapted for earthen wells. The canal and brick-built wells fully supply all the wants of the people in this respect. In the whole parganah there were 825 brick-built and 126 earthen wells at the time of settlement. The Pundirs of the K\u0101tha are a proud, stiff-necked generation, very clannish, and always ready to unite in open or secret opposition to the law; but of late years there has been much improvement in these respects. They are not too proud to labour with their own hands, but make admirable horse-breeders.\n\nThe last year of Mr. Thornton's settlement of this parganah showed a land revenue amounting to Rs. 1,02,249, which was increased to Rs. 1,11,467 by Mr. Vans Agnew. Mr. Wynne fixed the assessment at Rs. 1,29,108 on a total area of 80,105 acres, of which 72,247 acres were assessed to land revenue, and of these, 59,537 acres were cultivated. The actual land revenue for 1872 amounted to Rs. 1,15,892 (or with cesses, Rs. 1,28,110), falling at a rate of Re. 1-6-6 per British acre on the total area, at Re. 1-7-4 per acre on the area assessed to Government revenue, and at Re. 1-12-8 per acre on the cultivated area. The sum paid by cultivators to the landowners as rent and cesses during the same year has been estimated at Rs. 1,92,250.\n\nBetween the years 1839-40 and 1859-60 two whole villages and 57 portions of villages, having an area of 4,555 acres, and paying a revenue of Rs. 6,919, and valued at Rs. 39,286, were transferred by private arrangement in this parganah. The transfers by decree of Court comprised one entire village and 63 portions of villages, having an aggregate area of 4,859 acres, and paying a revenue of Rs. 6,933. The value recorded was Rs. 22,702. Out of the 43 whole and 94 portions of villages remaining with the original proprietors, 384 acres, bearing a revenue of Rs. 593, valued at Rs. 4,304, of the former, and 2,814 acres, bearing a revenue of Rs. 4,101, valued at Rs. 22,864, of the latter, were under mortgage. These statistics give a percentage of private transfers to the total area of five per cent., of transfers by decree of Court amounting to six per cent., and of transfers by mortgage amounting to four per cent. The average value per acre in each of these cases was Rs. 8-10-0, Rs. 4-10-9 and Rs. 8-0-0, and the land revenue assessed amounted to Re. 1-6-0, Re. 1-6-9 and Re. 1-1-0 per acre respectively. The result from the entire parganah on 15 per cent. of the total area gives an average value of Rs. 7-0-0 per acre when the average land revenue amounted to\nRe. 1-6-0 per acre. The principal losers were G\u00fajars, who still hold fifteen entire villages, besides shares in others.\n\nAccording to the census of 1872, parganah R\u00e1mpur contained 115 villages, of which 26 had less than 200 inhabitants; 41 had between 200 and 500; 28 had between 500 and 1,000; 18 had between 1,000 and 2,000; and one had between 3,000 and 5,000. The only town containing more than 5,000 inhabitants is R\u00e1mpur. The settlement records show 140 estates, of which three are held revenue free for life, and three are free of revenue in perpetuity. The total population in 1872 numbered 74,732 souls (33,718 females), giving 579 to the square mile. Classified according to religion, there were 59,201 Hind\u00fas, of whom 26,387 were females; 15,521 Musalm\u00e1ns, amongst whom 7,330 were females, and there were four Christians. Distributing the Hind\u00fa population amongst the four great classes, the census shows 3,617 Brahmans, of whom 1,644 were females; 4,436 Rajp\u00fats, including 1,761 females; 2,556 Baniyas (1,392 females); whilst the great mass of the population is included in \"the other castes\" of the census returns, which show a total of 48,592 souls, of whom 21,818 are females. The principal Brahman sub-division found in this parganah is the Gaur (3,602). The Rajp\u00fats belong to the Pundir (3,231), Kh\u00e1g\u00ed (311), Jhotiyana, Bargoti and Rahtor clans. The Baniyas are principally of the Agarw\u00e1l (1,092) and Saraugi (1,346) subdivisions. The other castes are the Jogi, Jul\u00e1ha (2,325), Kumbh\u00e1r (1,630), Haj\u00e1m, Kah\u00e1r (4,166), Cham\u00e1r (14,789), Kh\u00e1krob (3,213), G\u00e1jar (7,905), Barhai (1,214), Loh\u00e1r, Bair\u00e1gi, Garariya (1,116), Darzi, M\u00e1li, Saini (3,370), Dhobi, Bh\u00e1t, J\u00e1t, Orh, Chhip\u00ed, Sonar, Bharbh\u00fanja, Kalw\u00e1r, Gos\u00e1n, Taga, Kayath, Mium\u00e1r and Ahir divisions. The Musalm\u00e1ns show amongst them Shaikhs (1,617), converted Pundirs (831), Chauh\u00e1ns and Rajp\u00fats and Path\u00e1ns (1,098); the remainder are entered without distinction. The principal landholders are the G\u00fajars, who hold 20,070 acres; Rajp\u00fats, who have 16,109 acres; Mah\u00e1jans, with 6,479; Shaikhs, with 4,099; and J\u00e1ts, Rohs, Tagas, Brahmans, Musalm\u00e1n G\u00fajars, G\u00e1rf\u00e9, Sayyids, and Path\u00e1ns, who have each more than one thousand acres.\n\nThe occupations of the people are shown in the statistics collected at the census of 1872. From these it appears that of the male adult population (not less than fifteen years of age) 731 are employed in professional avocations, such as Government servants, priests, doctors, and the like; 3,183 in domestic service, as personal servants, water-carriers, barbers, sweepers, washermen, &c.; 1,374 in commerce, in buying, selling, keeping or lending money or goods, or the conveyance of men, animals, or goods; 9,805 in agricultural operations; 4,527 in industrial occupations, arts and mechanics, and the preparation of all classes of substances, vegetable, mineral, and animal. There were 4,779 persons returned as labourers, and 805 as of no specified occupation. Taking the total popu-\nlution, irrespective of age or sex, the same returns give 9,205 as landholders, 14,906 as cultivators, and 50,621 as engaged in occupations unconnected with agriculture. The educational statistics, which are confessedly imperfect, show 21 males as able to read and write out of a total male population numbering 41,008 souls.\n\nRampur is one of the old Akbari parganahs, formerly included in dastir Deoband. The land revenue in 1840-41 stood at Rs. 38,943. In the following year it lost Rs. 3,090 and gained Rs. 47,423 by transfers, leaving the revenue at Rs. 83,276. One village was transferred to Muzaffarnagar, and seven were received from that district. The changes effected in the area of this parganah in 1855 are shown below:\n\n| Transferred to | Received from |\n|----------------|---------------|\n| Name of parganah | No. of villages | Area in acres | Land revenue | Population | Name of parganah | No. of villages | Area in acres | Land revenue | Population |\n| Nakur ... | 2 | 1,528 | 1,592 | 1,054 | Ketha ... | 8 | 8,313 | 9,329 | 5,232 |\n| Saharanpur ... | 6 | 2,428 | 8,128 | 1,737 | Saharanpur ... | 8 | 1,711 | 2,519 | 1,050 |\n| Gangoh ... | 11 | 4,914 | 6,295 | 2,991 | Gangoh ... | 7 | 3,994 | 4,017 | 3,301 |\n| Deoband ... | 3 | 1,583 | 2,070 | 1,869 | Deoband ... | 1 | 303 | 365 | 311 |\n| Total ... | 22 | 10,447 | 13,010 | 7,151 | Total ... | 19 | 14,221 | 16,130 | 8,794 |\n\nThis left 138 villages, with an area of 84,271 acres, assessed at Rs. 99,935, and inhabited by 58,066 souls.\n\nRurki (Roorkee), an important town situated on an elevated ridge overlooking the bed of the Solani in parganah Rurki of the Saharanpur district, is distant 22 miles east from Saharanpur in latitude 29\u00b0 52' 25\", and longitude 77\u00b0 55' 40\".\n\nThe population in 1853 numbered 8,592 souls, and in 1865 there were 7,588 inhabitants. Out of a total population of 10,778 in 1872, there were 6,925 Hindus (2,692 females); 3,551 Musalmans (1,899 females), and 302 Christians (137 females). The town site occupies 70 acres, giving 154 souls to the acre. Distributing the population amongst the urban and rural classes proper, there were 142 landholders, 220 cultivators, and 10,416 persons pursuing avocations unconnected with agriculture in 1872. The number of enclosures in the same year was 1,469, of which 883 were occupied by Hindus, 526 by Musalmans, and 60 by Christians. The number of houses was 3,587, and of these 2,307 were occupied by Hindus, and 1,179 by Musalmans; 2,188 houses were built with skilled labour, of which Hindus\npossessed 1,362, and Musalmans owned 727. Of the 1,399 mud huts in the town, 945 were inhabited by Hind\u00fas, and 452 by Musalmans. Taking the male adult population (not less than fifteen years of age), the following occupations are found to be represented by more than fifty members each:\u2014Blacksmiths, 64; cultivators, 72; labourers, 702; landowners, 62; servants, 2,622; shopkeepers, 571; water-carriers, 68; and weavers, 50.\n\nR\u00farki was, until the Ganges Canal works were commenced, a mere mud-built village on the banks of the Sol\u00e1ni Nadi. It is now a fair-sized town, with good, broad, metalled roadways meeting at right angles and lined with shops. The centre space contains an open chawk or market-place. The roads on each side are lined with open saucer drains leading to the lowlands beyond the town. The Ganges Canal, flowing between raised embankments, passes the town on the east. Between it and the town are several open water-holes, which during the hot weather present a large expanse of uncovered mud. On the west of the town the land is low and moist, and the Mas\u00fari (Mussooree) road passes through it by a raised embankment. On the north lies the bed of the Sol\u00e1ni, here fully a mile wide, always moist and green, and in the rains containing a considerable body of water. The town extends a little down into this low tract, and there the water in the wells was found to stand at six feet from the surface in March, whilst at the same time in the upper portion of the town it stood at twenty-one feet. Percolation from the canal has here, as elsewhere, raised the spring-level, and brought with it ague and other malarious diseases, but not to such an extent as is found elsewhere, owing to the greater attention to cleanliness and ordinary sanitary precautions due to the presence of an European element in the management of the town.\n\nR\u00farki possesses an excellent meteorological observatory under careful management, and the results of the observations made here are particularly worthy of record. The following table gives the mean barometer readings for five years, reduced for temperature, but not for sea level. The mean of each month for the same years is also given:\n\n| Year | January | February | March | April | May | June | July | August | September | October | November | December

well-made bridged and metalled road crossing the Ganges Canal at \u00bc mile, R\u00e1mpur (q.v.) at two miles, Bhagw\u00e1npur at 7 miles, and joining the Sah\u00e1ranpur and Dehra road at Chatmalpur, one mile south of Fatehpur. An alternative route, which should not be attempted in the rains, is afforded by the road via Bah\u00e1durabad to Hardw\u00e1r, 9\u00bd miles, crossing the Sol\u00e1ni and Ratnau, which are fordable except after heavy rain, the former soon after leaving R\u00farki, and the latter at four miles, and arrive at Bah\u00e1durabad; thence to Hardw\u00e1r, 7 miles, Kansrao, 12 miles, Lachhiw\u00e1l\u00e1, 8 miles, and Dehra, 10\u00bd miles. The route through the Eastern D\u00edn is unhealthy during and immediately after the rains. In proceeding to Sah\u00e1ranpur\u2014the road turns off at Bhagw\u00e1npur, 9 miles, to Hindan bridge on the Sah\u00e1ranpur and Dehra road,\u2014the first stage is Umrpur (11 miles). The road is metalled for seven miles, and after that is tolerably good. The country is well-wooded and cultivated, supplies are procurable, water is good. In proceeding to Meerut the first stage is P\u00far in the Muzaffarnagar district (15\u00bd miles); the road passes by Manglaur, where there is a police-station and branch post-office, and crosses the canal by a bridge at 9\u00bd miles.\n\nR\u00farki is said to have been founded by a Rajp\u00fat chief of some local notoriety, who called the place after one of his wives named R\u00fari. It, however, owes its chief distinction to its being the head-quarters of the Ganges Canal workshops and iron-foundry, established here in 1852, and the Civil Engineering College, instituted in 1847 by the late Mr. Thomason, Lieutenant-Governor of these Provinces, both of which have already been described in the district notice. The Sappers and Miners of the Native Army have been cantoned here since 1853, and it has formed a station for British troops since 1860. The garrison, European and native, now number about one thousand men of all ranks. The Church of St. John the Baptist was built here in 1852, and consecrated some four years afterwards. A Cantonment Magistrate has been stationed here since 1859 (G. O. G. G., 28th July, 1858). There is a good dispensary, under the superintendence of the Surgeon attached to the Sappers and Miners, who is also the Civil Surgeon of the station, besides a first class police-station, post-office and a tahs\u00edli. The Society for the Propagation of the Gospel has a mission school here, and there is also another private school, called the Orman Institute, after Major Orman, late Cantonment Magistrate of R\u00farki. The Chaunkd\u00e1ri Act (XX. of 1856) is in force both in the cantonments and civil station and in the native town. In the former, in 1872, a village police force, numbering 14 men, was supported from a house-tax, at an annual cost of Rs. 1,286, in addition to a staff of sweepers. A separate collection from the native town supported during the same year 16 men, at a cost of Rs. 792 per annum, for police purposes, besides a few\nscavengers. The total income from all sources during 1872-73 amounted to Rs. 8,062, a great portion of which was expended on local improvements. At Piran Kaliyar on the Ganges Canal, about four or five miles north-east of R\u00farki, a Muhammadan fair is held every year, to celebrate the death of Raja Karn. The fair takes place on the first day of the month Rabi-ul-awal, and is attended equally by Musalm\u00e1ns and Hind\u00fas. There was much sickness of a malarious type prevalent here in 1867 amongst the 79th Highlanders, and some account of it is given in Dr. Cutcliffe's Sanitary Report (1868). Malarious fever is still not uncommon at R\u00farki, and occasionally epidemic cholera breaks out. The last attack of cholera occurred in 1872. In a radius of eight miles around the town, containing a population of 78,619 souls, distributed amongst 60 centres of population, there were 777 cases of cholera and 323 deaths reported; and notwithstanding a strict sanitary cordon around the cantonments, several deaths took place within both the European and native quarters.\n\nThe fiscal history of R\u00farki is of some interest. From about the middle of the last century it formed part of the great estate held on a fixed revenue (mukarari) by the powerful Guj\u00e1r family of Landhaura, and remained in their possession until the death of Raja R\u00e1mday\u00e1l in 1813. The town of R\u00farki, with seventeen dependent villages, were then settled with certain of the Rajput proprietors without any previous attempt to define the rights possessed by the individuals from whom engagements for the land revenue were taken. In fact, here as elsewhere, so long as the proprietary body, through their representatives recorded in the village papers, punctually discharged the revenue, no inquiries were ever made as to the internal constitution of the estate. At several of the quinquennial settlements the numbers of the proprietary body were increased without any further examination into their rights. At last some members of the proprietary body became indebted to the notorious Shaikh Kalan of R\u00e9inpur, and his sons, Ni\u011fabat Ali Kh\u00e1n and Z\u00e1min Ali Kh\u00e1n. Three of their debtors were sued in the Civil Court, and a decree was obtained in an undefended suit for possession of the shares of the debtors in R\u00farki which had been conveyed by a deed of conditional sale to the sons of Shaikh Kalan. Here the imperfection of the record-of-rights gave the astute Musalm\u00e1ns the desired opportunity. More for form's sake than that they ever had any right to it, the names of two of the debtors were recorded in the bond as possessors of \"the third portion of the sixth division of the town of R\u00farki, \u00bcth and \u00bdth of Akbarpur, and one-half of Salimpur,\" and the third was said to own the sixth division of R\u00farki, half of R\u00e1mpur, and one-fourth of Akbarpur. A decree was given in the terms of the bond, without any further inquiry, and in 1824 orders were issued for giving possession to the Shaikhs, which was effected by the Collector in the same year.\n\n---\n\n1 Sel. Rev. Rec., N.-W. F., 1873, p. 272; 1 Set. Rep., 82.\nIn 1825 these proceedings came under the notice of the Board of Revenue, and from inquiries made, it was found that in the portion of R\u00farki and its dependencies transferred to the Shaikhs, there were actually seventy-two individuals in possession by virtue of proprietary right, and not three, as had been stated in the decree; and such was the lax procedure in vogue in those days, that these three individuals were able not only to convey the title in their own lands, but practically the title of sixty-nine of their fellow sharers. After putting their heads together, the great legal authorities declared that, as the Shaikhs had been once in possession they could not be ousted again save by a regular appeal to the proper court. This court lay then in Bareilly, more than 130 miles off, and in that day the roads were not so easy as they are now; and if the R\u00farki Rajputs desired to save their property, which became imperilled through no fault of their own, they had to undergo the trouble, expense and danger of a journey to Bareilly in the hope of getting justice done to them. At the settlement in 1838 thirteen out of the fifteen dependent villages were settled with the zamindars of R\u00farki, and for the remaining two they were allowed a charge of five per cent. on the land revenue, whilst the settlement was made with the actual resident proprietors.\n\nR\u00farki, a parganah in the R\u00farki tahsil of the Sah\u00e1ranpur district, is bounded on the north by the Siwal\u00edk hills; on the east by parganah Jaw\u00e1lipur; on the west by parganah Bhagw\u00e1npur; and on the south by parganah Manglaur. According to the census of 1872, parganah R\u00farki had then a total area of 198 square miles, of which 71 square miles were under cultivation. The area assessed to Government revenue during the same year was 107 square miles, of which 69 square miles were cultivated, 18 square miles were culturable, and 20 square miles were barren. The villages of this parganah were divided into four groups for the purposes of assessment. The first of these comprises a few villages on the high plateau south of R\u00farki, and bordering on parganah Manglaur. With few exceptions, the surface here is perfectly level, the soil is good, and the sub-soil is retentive of moisture. The spring level is 32 to 34 feet from the surface, so that irrigation from wells is impracticable, and the level of the country is too high for canal irrigation. Still good sugar-cane and wheat crops are grown in ordinary years without watering. The second group includes the villages with mixed uplands and lowlands. The lowlands are subject to the denudating action of the Sol\u00e1ni, but when removed from its influence, produce excellent sugar-cane, cotton and wheat. Near Jaur\u00e1si the highlands are much broken up into ravines, which, owing to the indolence and apathy of the people, are year by year cutting more and more into the cultivable area. With the exception of one narrow strip on the west, the remainder of the highlands\npossess a soil similar to that described under the first group, and with similar capabilities if irrigated, but owing to the depth at which water is found (20 to 32 feet), irrigation is practically unknown, and only bajra and jowar are grown.\n\nThe third group contains the villages on the northern plateau of the uplands. In those lying between the Haljaura and Ratman torrents, there are several strips of good khaddir along both those streams, which produce good wheat and sugar-cane, and in places good rice. The uplands of these villages are very undulating, with a light soil, and a spring level varying from 23 to 42 feet from the surface, so that there is no irrigation, and the only fair crops are bajra and jowar. The villages in the tract lying between the Ratman torrent and the Siwaliks are intersected by the Pathari, a mountain torrent, causing much diversity of surface. The water in this portion of the third group is found at a depth of from 16 to 40 feet from the surface, the population is thin, and the cultivation of the more valuable crops is very restricted. The fourth or lowland group of villages possesses a fairly level surface, with a gradual slope from west to east, and also to the south-east. In the latter direction there is much swampy land near the banks of the Pathari, and in the d\u00e1khar tracts where the Hadw\u00e1ha takes its rise. A rich rauseli soil prevails in the west, and d\u00e1khar is the characteristic soil on the east. In the marshy tract, rice, and in the rest, wheat, sugar-cane and cotton grow well where the cleaning of the crops from weeds is attended to. Water is found at a depth of from eight to twelve feet from the surface.\n\nThe last year of Mr. Thornton's settlement of this parganah showed a land revenue of Rs. 42,023, increased on revision to Rs. 45,835. Mr. Wynne was then appointed to examine the assessments made on revision by Mr. VansAgnew, and proposed a land revenue amounting to Rs. 50,661 on a total area of 60,046 acres, of which 47,741 acres were assessed to land revenue, and of these 35,648 acres were then under cultivation. The actual land revenue in 1872 amounted to Rs. 53,034 (or with cesses, Rs. 58,464), falling at a rate of Re. 0-6-8 per British acre on the total area, at Re. 0-12-5 per acre on the area assessed to Government revenue, and at Re. 1-2-8 per acre on the cultivated area. The sum paid by cultivators to the landowners as rent and cesses during the same year has been estimated at Rs. 88,566. Between the years 1839-40 and 1859-60, four whole villages and 19 portions of villages, having an area of 2,676 acres, and paying a revenue of Rs. 4,127, and valued at Rs. 16,189, were transferred by private arrangement in this parganah. The transfers by decree of Court comprised one entire village and 18 portions of villages, having an aggregate area of 1,780 acres, and paying a revenue of Rs. 2,710. The value recorded was Rs. 10,418. Out of the 52\nwhole and 34 portions of villages remaining with the original proprietors, 208 acres, bearing a revenue of Rs. 193, valued at Rs. 1,201, of the former, and 134 acres, bearing a revenue of Rs. 108, valued at Rs. 390, of the latter, were under mortgage. These statistics give a percentage of private transfers to the total area of four per cent., and of transfers by decree of Court amounting to three per cent. The transfers by mortgage are merely nominal. The average value per acre in the case of transfers by private and public sale was Rs. 6-0-4 and Rs. 5-13-7, and the land revenue assessed amounted to Re. 1-9-0 and Re. 1-8-4 per acre respectively. The result from the entire parganah on seven per cent. of the total area gives an average value of Rs. 4-14-0 per acre when the average land revenue amounted to Re. 1-7-10 per acre. Pathans, Brahmins and Rajputs lost one entire village each, and Gujars lost four; Hindu Rajputs still hold 27 entire villages.\n\nAccording to the census of 1872, parganah Rurki contained 107 inhabited villages, of which 37 had less than 200 inhabitants; 37 had between 200 and 500; 18 had between 500 and 1,000; 12 had between 1,000 and 2,000; two had between 2,000 and 3,000. The only town containing more than 5,000 inhabitants is Rurki. The settlement records show that there are 118 estates in this parganah, of which two are held free of revenue in perpetuity, and twenty-two are jungle grants. The total population in 1872 numbered 54,881 souls (24,747 females), giving 277 to the square mile. Classified according to religion, there were 34,657 Hindus, of whom 15,606 were females; 19,895 Musalmans, amongst whom 9,004 were females; and there were 302 Christians. Distributing the Hindu population amongst the four great classes, the census shows 1,786 Brahmins, of whom 737 were females; 749 Rajputs, including 277 females; 1,940 Baniyas (774 females); whilst the great mass of the population is included in \"the other castes\" of the census returns, which show a total of 30,182 souls, of whom 13,818 are females. The principal Brahman subdivisions found in this parganah are the Gaur (1,611) and Kanaujia. The Rajputs belong to the Pundir (560), Chauhan and Panwar clans, and the Baniyas to the Agarwal (1,235), Sarangi, Bishnoi and Garg divisions. The other castes comprise the Jatia, Jogi, Kumbhar, Hajjam, Kabar (1,678), Cham\u00e1r (11,270), Khakrob (1,068), Gujar, Barhai, Lohar, Bairagi, Garariya, Darzi, Koli, Mal\u00ed, Saini (4,357), Dhobi, Bh\u00e1t, J\u00e1t, Orh (997), Chhipi, Son\u00e1r, Bharbhunja, Kalw\u00e1r, Goshain, Tagas, Kamboh, Kayath, Ahir, Khatik, Lodha, Banjara (932), Khatri, Lohera, Chauhan, Kachhi, Aheriya, Nuniya and Pasi castes. The Musalmans comprise Shaikhs (607), converted Pundirs (107), converted Chauhan (24), other Rajputs (300), and Pathans (810); the remainder are entered without distinction. The principal landholders belong to the Gujar, Rajput, both Hindu and Musalman, Goshain, Mahajan, Saini and Jhoja divisions.\nThe occupations of the people are shown in the statistics collected at the census of 1872. From these it appears that, of the male adult population (not less than fifteen years of age), 433 are employed in professional avocations, such as Government servants, priests, doctors, and the like; 4,120 in domestic service, as personal servants, water-carriers, barbers, sweepers, washermen, &c.; 1,141 in commerce, in buying, selling, keeping or lending money or goods, or the conveyance of men, animals, or goods; 6,016 in agricultural operations; 2,368 in industrial occupations, arts and mechanics, and the preparation of all classes of substances, vegetable, mineral, and animal. There were 4,460 persons returned as labourers, and 413 as of no specified occupation. Taking the total population, irrespective of age or sex, the same returns give 465 as landholders, 17,196 as cultivators, and 37,220 as engaged in occupations unconnected with agriculture. The educational statistics, which are confessedly imperfect, show 952 males as able to read and write out of a total male population numbering 30,107 souls.\n\nR\u00farki is one of the old Akbari parganahs, formerly included in Dastur Deoband. It remained unchanged until 1842. The land revenue in 1840-41 amounted to Rs. 74,793, and in the following year it received by transfer villages assessed at Rs. 44,241, and lost villages assessed at Rs. 4,461. In 1855 considerable changes took place in its area, which are shown by the following table:\n\n| Transferred to | Received from |\n|----------------|---------------|\n| Name of parganah | Number of villages | Area in acres | Land revenue | Population | Name of parganah | Number of villages | Area in acres | Land revenue | Population |\n| Haraura        | 28            | 14,295       | 18,723       | 9,619       | Jaunjal       | 91             | 66,189      | 34,254      | 37,612      |\n| Bhagwanpur     | 69            | 40,208       | 56,803       | 35,066      | Jawalapur     | 2              | 1,409       | 750         | 1,289       |\n| Jawalapur      | 17            | 15,937       | 9,023        | 6,731       |               |                |              |             |             |\n| Manglaur       | 24            | 13,223       | 17,196       | 16,933      |               |                |              |             |             |\n| Total          |               |              |              |             |               |                |              |             |             |\n| Balance        |               |              |              |             |               |                |              |             |             |\n\nRs. 67,598 35,004 88,901\n\nRs. 82,208 52,251 55,849\nR\u00farki, a tahsil in the Sah\u00e1ranpur district, comprises the parganahs of R\u00farki, Jaw\u00e1lapur Manglaur and Bhagw\u00e1npur. The total area according to the census of 1872 contains 789 square miles, of which 330 square miles are cultivated. The area assessed to Government revenue is given at 503 square miles, of which 328 square miles are cultivated 108 square miles are culturable, and 67 square miles are barren. The land revenue during the same year stood at Rs. 2,76,588 (or with cesses, Rs. 3,04,345), falling at Re. 0-8-9 per acre on the total area, Re. 0-13-9 per acre on the area assessed to Government revenue, and Re. 1-4-11 on the cultivated area. The population numbered 242,696 souls (109,010 females), giving 307 to the square mile, distributed amongst 498 villages. The same statistics show 20 persons insane, 5 idiots, 46 deaf and dumb, 604 blind, and 52 lepers in the tahsil. This tahsil occupies the whole of the east of the district from the Siw\u00e1liks to the Muzaffarnagar district, and fully two-thirds of it is covered with forest, or lies in the lowlands drained by the Sol\u00e1n\u00ed, Ratman, Pathari and R\u00e1nipur torrents. Other matters connected with the tahsil are given under the district notice, or separately under each parganah.\n\nSah\u00e1ranpur, the chief town of the Sah\u00e1ranpur district, is situated in the parganah of the same name in latitude 29\u00b0-28'-15\", and longitude 77\u00b0-35'-15\". The population in 1847 numbered 34,294 souls; in 1853 there were 31,988 inhabitants; and in 1865 there were 44,119. In 1872 the population was returned at 43,844, of whom 19,528 were Hind\u00fas (8,665 females); 24,296 were Musalm\u00e1ns (11,898 females), and 20 were Christians and others not included in the above two classes. Distributing the population amongst the rural and urban classes proper the same returns show 613 landholders, 2,124 cultivators, and 41,107 persons engaged in occupations unconnected with agriculture. In 1872 there were 4,492 enclosures in the city, of which 1,705 were occupied by Hind\u00fas, 3,283 by Musalm\u00e1ns, and four by Christians. During the same year there were 9,364 houses, of which 4,621 were built by skilled labour, and of these 2,257 were inhabited by Hind\u00fas and 2,361 by Musalm\u00e1ns. Of the 4,743 mud huts in the town, 2,824 were occupied by Hind\u00fas and 3,916 by Musalm\u00e1ns. The area occupied by the town is 550 acres, giving 80 inhabitants to the acre. Taking the male adult population (not less than fifteen years of age) we find the following occupations represented by more than fifty males:\u2014Barbers, 240; beggars, 286; blacksmiths, 82; bricklayers, 55; butchers, 140; carpenters, 82; cultivators, 775; dyers, 51; goldsmiths, 140; grain-parochers, 55; green-grocers, 54; herdsmen, 127; labourers, 3,090; landowners, 199; letters of carriages, 109; merchants, 385; money-lenders, 108; oil-makers, 115; polishers, 61; potters, 221; purohits, 114; servants, 4,166; shopkeepers, 2,304; shoemakers, 334; singers, 131; stone-masons, 60; sweepers, 284; washermen, 90; water-carriers,\n129; and weavers, 995. Out of the whole population only 327 males are shown as able to read and write. The Musalmans are a very influential body here, and have recently commenced to build a new masjid on the plan of the Delhi Jamai Masjid.\n\nSaharanpur is the head-quarters of the district, and the residence of the Collector-Magistrate and his assistants. The mission, the stud, and the botanical gardens have already been noticed in the account of the district. In addition to these institutions, there is a very good dispensary, schools, a distributing post-office, a telegraph office, a first-class police-station, the head-quarters of the Jumna Canal establishment, the tahsil, an old Rohilla (Ruhela) fort now used as an office, a district jail, a fine new mosque, and St. Thomas's Church, built in 1854, and consecrated in 1858. The railway was opened here in 1869, and there is one hotel and a travellers' bungalow in the European quarter near the railway station. This being the point of departure from the rail for travellers to Mauiri (Muzzaffarabad), the station presents a busy appearance during the commencement and close of the hot season, and the hotel and dak bungalow are usually crowded with Europeans passing to and fro during those months. Saharanpur was the principal station in the Great Trigonometrical Survey of the Himalayas, where all the most valuable observations, whether of latitude, longitude or azimuth, were taken. According to the spirit-levelling records of the survey, the surface of the stone slab on the west side of the south porch of the Church is 902-73 feet above the level of the sea. The top of the first milestone on the Meerut road, or thirty-sixth from Muzzaffarnagar, is 906-55 feet, and the top of the fourth milestone in the Dehra road is 912-07 feet above the level of the sea.\n\nThe civil station lies on both sides of the Damaula Nadi, which is crossed by a low bridge. The railway station is close to the city side of the nadi, which flows through the centre of the civil station past the north-west suburb of the city. The site of the city itself is low and moist, the water is near the surface,\u2014at a depth of seven to ten feet in March, and close enough in the rains to reach it from above. All the surrounding land is, as a rule, irrigated from the canal. On the west was a large excavation known as the Raiwala Jor, which has recently been filled up, and is now cultivated. The drainage which used to fall into it has been taken right through the town by a large masonry drain, which in two places passes through cuttings. Within the north-eastern suburb of the city is the Pandhoi Nadi, which joins the Damaula near the civil station. This was, until the recent improvements were carried out, a mere sluggish swamp, used as a receptacle for all manner of filth, overgrown with jungle, and choked with mud. In 1870, a project embracing the effectual surface drainage of the city, the thorough reclamation to purity of the Pandhoi Nadi, and the straightening\nand deepening of the Damaula to its junction with the Hindan, a distance of quite eight miles was carried out under the superintendence of Mr. G. H. Howe, C.E. This has resulted in a marked decrease in the malarious diseases for which the city of Saharanpur had been some time notorious. The ghats on the Pandhori were repaired, and better arrangements made for the removal of refuse.\n\nAbout one-half the houses are built of brick, and these are being added to daily. The ganj or principal market place is an important busy spot. The bazar way is narrow but long, and lined on each side by good shops, the floors of which are raised about three feet above the road level, whilst on each side an open saucer drain renders the permanent accumulation of impurities impossible. The smaller roadways however contain open, deep, narrow brick drains, which are too often neglected. This evil however is in process of removal. The principal streets are metalled with kunkur. Only one muhalla lies to the east of the Pandhori, the remainder all lying to the west. Cultivation formerly extended close to the houses on the western side, but the growing of high rain crops close to the site has recently been put a stop to, as has been done with marked advantage in other large centres of population. Rheumatism, ague, influenza, fever, and occasionally small-pox as an epidemic, are common in Saharanpur. Dr. Planck thinks that there is reason to suppose that fever has been prevalent here since the foundation of the city, and cites its abandonment as a military station many years ago in proof of his surmise. At the same time the introduction of the canal has had much to do with the ague from which the people now universally suffer. The water level has been raised, and drainage has not been attended to, whilst the flow of the natural existing lines of drainage has been impeded by the same causes. At the same time the character of the well-water has been changed for the worse. There are now few good wells, and the surface impurities held in solution have a smaller depth through which to percolate before mingling with the well-water. In many places where the well-water used to be clear and sparkling, it is now of a dull colour, with a brackish or unpleasant taste. The new drainage and other works have already effected an improvement in these matters, but it will take some time and much close supervision before the sanitary arrangements of the city can be considered to be in a satisfactory state.\u00b9\n\nSaharanpur possesses a municipality supported by an octroi tax, which in 1872-73 gave a revenue of Rs. 38,324. The affairs of Municipality. the municipality are managed by a committee of fifteen members, of whom five are appointed ex-officio, two are nominated by the house-proprietors and inhabitants of the civil station, and the remainder are elected by the tax-payers. The following statements give the statistics of the octroi\n\n\u00b9 For an elaborate description of the drainage system, see Dr. Cutcliffe's Report, App. A., p. 2.\ncollections for a series of years, and at the same time indicate the nature and relative importance of the local trade. The population within the limits of the municipality numbered 45,019 souls in 1872-73, and the incidence of taxation fell at 13\u00bd annas per head of the population:\n\n### Receipts\n\n|          | 1868-69 | 1869-70 | 1870-71 | 1871-72 | 1872-73 | 1873-74 |\n|----------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| **Rs.**  |         |         |         |         |         |         |\n| Opening balance | ...     | 6,478   | 14,491  | 10,848  | 21,340  | 12,642  |\n| Class I.\u2014Food and drink | ...     |         |         |         |         |         |\n| II.\u2014Animals for slaughter | ...     |         |         |         |         |         |\n| III.\u2014Fuel, &c. | ...     |         |         |         |         |         |\n| IV.\u2014Building materials | ...     |         |         |         |         |         |\n| V.\u2014Drugs, spices | ...     |         |         |         |         |         |\n| VI.\u2014Tobacco | ...     |         |         |         |         |         |\n| VII.\u2014Textile fabrics | ...     |         |         |         |         |         |\n| VIII.\u2014Metals | ...     |         |         |         |         |         |\n| Total of octroi | ...     | 25,246  | 29,087  | 22,235  | 28,458  | 38,334  | 47,364  |\n| Rents | ...     | 134     |         |         |         |         | 298     | 1,002   |\n| Ordinary income other than taxation | ...     |         |         |         |         |         |         | 1,813   |\n| Extraordinary | ...     | 845     | 4,150   | 827     | 4,350   | 20,661  | 27,169  |\n| Total | ...     | 25,924  | 40,115  | 37,463  | 36,637  | 82,518  | 89,390  |\n\n### Expenditure\n\n|          | 1868-69 | 1869-70 | 1870-71 | 1871-72 | 1872-73 | 1873-74 |\n|----------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| **Rs.**  |         |         |         |         |         |         |\n| I.\u2014Collections | ...     | 3,101   | 2,598   | 2,252   | 2,330   | 2,728   | 2,546   |\n| II.\u2014Head-office | ...     |         |         |         |         |         |         |\n| III.\u2014Public Works\u2014 | ...     |         |         |         |         |         |         |\n| a.

It is therefore not absolutely accurate, as it will not correctly record the annual export in the case of any article which is principally on the move during the first three months of the year. The returns for 1873-74 are based on the actual registration of exports and imports for the whole year. In 1872-73 the export of grain amounted to about one-eighth the imports; 7,821 maunds of rice, 4,252 of wheat, and 1,269 of barley were exported to the Panj\u00e1b, and 6,839 maunds of rice, 3,850 of wheat, and 1,034 of barley went to districts in these provinces. The rice was chiefly taken by Muzaffarnagar, Meerut and H\u00e1thras, and the wheat by Cawnpore and Dehra. Of refined sugar 3,941 maunds were consigned to the Panj\u00e1b, and 598 to these provinces; of g\u00e9r, half the exports went to the Panj\u00e1b; shira was chiefly consumed by the neighbouring parts of the district. The cloth exported was taken for the most part by the north-western districts. The consumption per head in regard to saccharine substances, oil, tobacco, spices and metals seems too high when compared with the average for these provinces, which shows 15 sers, 4\u00bd sers, 3 sers, Re. 1-2-4 and Rs. 2-8-4 respectively. The rate\nof taxation for the last nine months of the year 1872-73 for the principal articles paying duty was as follows:\n\n| Per maund | Per maund | Per maund | Each |\n|-----------|-----------|-----------|------|\n| As.       | As.       | As.       | As.  |\n| Cleaned rice | ... 1 Other sugars | ... 1 | Country tobacco... 2 Sheep and goats 0 |\n| Other sorts of rice | ... 0 | Rab | Chewing tobacco... 2 Cattle ... 1 |\n| Superior grams | ... 0 | Rice | Copper ... 0 |\n| Inferior grams | ... 0 | Gai | Manufactured iron ... 4 Cloth ... 24 |\n| Fine wheat flour | ... 1 | Fish | Vessels of brass ... 10 Essences ... 40 |\n| Coarse ditto | ... 0 | Potatoes | Ditto of copper, 134 Drugs and spices 22 |\n| Other flours | ... 0 | Oil-seeds | Charcoal ... 0 Timber ... 32 |\n| Refined sugar | ... 4 | Oil | Country string ... 14 sticks, stone ... 24 |\n\nSaharanpur is passed on the route from Meerut to Ambala (Umballa), and is distant 9\u00bd miles from N\u00e1gal, and 10\u00bc miles from Sars\u00e1wa. The road from the border of the district is unmetalled as far as the Hindan (5 miles); thence on it is metalled. The railway is crossed by a level-crossing just beyond Saharanpur. The encamping ground is near the city. Hence to Sars\u00e1wa the road passes the Karn\u00e1l road and railway at two miles, and crosses the Eastern Jumna Canal by a bridge at 3\u00bd miles. From Saharanpur to Delhi the first stage is R\u00e1mpur (14 miles); the road is sandy and heavy in places, and crosses numerous canal channels and the Krishni river on the way. From Saharanpur to R\u00fark\u00ed (23\u00bd miles) the first stage is Umarpur (11\u00bd miles); the road crosses the N\u00e1gadeo by a bridge at 3 miles, the Hindan by a bridge at 6\u00bd miles, and the West K\u00e1li Nadi close to Sikandarpur. Both these latter rivers are always fordable, except after heavy rains. The road is rather a good one.\n\nSAHARANPUR, a parganah of the Saharanpur district, is bounded on the north by parganah Faizabad Bah\u00e1t; on the south by R\u00e1mpur; on the east by Haraura; and on the west by Sars\u00e1wa and Sult\u00e1npur.\n\nAccording to the census of 1872 it comprised a total area of 129 square miles, of which 97 square miles were under cultivation. The area assessed to Government revenue during the same year was 113 square miles, of which 92 square miles were cultivated, six square miles were culturable, and fifteen square miles were barren. The Jumna Canal passes through the western portion of the parganah, and irrigates a very large proportion (four-fifths) of the irrigated area, which amounts to about 57 per cent. of the cultivation. There is also some irrigation from wells and tanks. To the east of the canal runs the Krishni river, and east of this the Pandhoi and Duma\u00fala, which unite at the city of Saharanpur. On the extreme east the Hindan intersects the parganah. The course of all these streams is from north to south. The soil is generally good, showing eighteen per cent. of the first class, and only seven per cent. of the worst class in the whole cultivated area. The soil of the parganah may be divided into three belts or zones. In the northern zone it is light, and\nof the class called rausti, similar to that found in the parganahs to the north. In the southern belt it is generally a hard clayey rausti, resembling that found in the parganahs to the south; whilst the central zone combines the characteristics of both descriptions, and according to its elevation presents clay or sand in larger proportion. The produce of each season is about equal.\n\nThe thirty years' settlement of this parganah was made by Mr. E. Thornton, and in the year before the commencement of the existing settlement, amounted to Rs. 95,070. Mr. VansAgnew's new assessment rose to Rs. 95,561, and Mr. H. Robertson's revision gave a land revenue of Rs. 1,28,332, based on a total area amounting to 76,945 acres, of which 65,886 were charged with Government revenue, and of these 58,691 acres were cultivated. The land revenue for 1872 amounted to Rs. 1,18,083 (or with cesses, Rs. 1,30,506), falling at a rate of Re. 1-6-10 per British acre on the total area, at Re. 1-10-1 per acre on the area assessed to Government revenue, and at Re. 1-14-5 per acre on the cultivated area. The sum paid by cultivators to the landowners as rent and cesses during the same year has been estimated at Rs. 1,74,011.\n\nBetween the years 1839-40 and 1859-60, five whole villages and 105 portions of villages, having an area of 16,288 acres, and paying a revenue of Rs. 14,433, and valued at Rs. 74,543, were transferred by private arrangement in this parganah. The transfers by decree of Court comprised one entire village and 108 portion of villages, having an aggregate area of 16,831 acres, and paying a revenue of Rs. 12,569. The value recorded was Rs. 70,537. Out of the 33 whole and 141 portions of villages remaining with the original proprietors, 942 acres, assessed at Rs. 1,155, and valued at Rs. 8,461, of the former, and 13,227 acres, assessed at Rs. 11,014, and valued at Rs. 1,02,600, of the latter, were mortgaged. These statistics give a percentage of private transfers to the total area of 20 per cent., of transfers by decree of Court amounting to 21 per cent., and of transfers by mortgage amounting to 7 per cent. The average value per acre in each of these cases was Rs. 4-9-1, Rs. 4-6-1, and Rs. 7-15-0; and the land revenue assessed amounted to Re. 0-14-2, Re. 0-11-11, and Re. 0-13-0 per acre respectively. The result from the entire parganah on 48 per cent. of the total area gives an average value of Rs. 5-7-0 per acre where the average land revenue amounted to Re. 0-13-3 per acre. Pathans, Brahmans and Gujars lost one entire village each, and Hindu Rajputs lost two entire villages and 63 shares, but still retain nine villages.\n\nAccording to the census of 1872, parganah Saharanpur contained 140 inhabited villages, of which 39 had less than 200 inhabitants, 47 had between 200 and 500, 41 had between 500 and 1,000, nine had between 1,000 and 2,000, two had between 2,000 and\n3,000, and one had between 3,000 and 5,000. The only town containing more than 5,000 inhabitants is the city of Saharanpur itself. At the time of settlement there were 179 estates, of which nine were held free of revenue. The total population numbered 109,767 souls (50,825 females) in 1872, giving 851 to the square mile. Classified according to religion, there were 60,220 Hindus, of whom 27,084 were females; 49,627 Musalmans, amongst whom 23,732 were females; and there were 20 Christians. Distributing the Hindu population amongst the four great classes, the census shows 3,614 Brahmans, of whom 1,600 were females; 2,095 Rajputs, including 789 females; 5,715 Baniyas (2,639 females); whilst the great mass of the population is included in \"the other castes\" of the census returns, which show a total of 48,796 souls, of whom 22,056 are females. The principal Brahman sub-divisions found in this parganah are the Gaur, numbering 3,199 souls, and the Saraswat and Ach\u00e1ra\u00ed, numbering 75 and 92 members respectively. They own two entire estates. Amongst the Rajputs are the Pundir (386), Khagi (176), Polast, Bais and Ban\u00e1phar clans. They own three entire estates. Agarw\u00e1l Baniyas number 4,355 souls, and Sarangis, 388; other Baniya divisions represented here are the Biahnoi, Garg, Goyel, and Dasa. They possess nine entire estates. The other castes show Jul\u00e1has (1,155), Jogis (543), Kumh\u00e1rs (1,586), Hajj\u00e1ms (617), Kah\u00e1rs (4,339), Cham\u00e1rs (17,355); Kh\u00e1krobs (2,705), Gujars (3,829), Barhais (1,379), Loh\u00e1rs (560), Garariyas (444), M\u00e1l\u00eds (4,223); Sain\u00eds (2,933), J\u00e1t\u00eds (462); Chip\u00eds (358), Son\u00e1rs (660), Tag\u00e1s (711), Kayaths (492), Khat\u00edks (536), Khattr\u00eds (465), and Ah\u00edrs (440). Kal\u00e1ls possess two entire estates, Sain\u00eds have one, Khattr\u00eds three, Kayaths one, Gujars nine, J\u00e1t\u00eds one, and Tag\u00e1s hold five. Musalmans possess 24 entire estates in the parganah. The cultivators are chiefly G\u00e1r\u00e1s, Gujars and Sain\u00eds. The Musalmans comprise Shaikhs (5,614), converted Pundirs (1,144), Kh\u00e1g\u00eds (298), other Rajputs (671), and Path\u00e1ns (2,675); the remainder are entered without distinction.\n\nThe occupations of the people are shown in the statistics collected at the census of 1872. From these it appears that, of the male adult population (not less than fifteen years of age) 886 are employed in professional avocations, such as Government servants, priests, doctors, and the like; 6,980 in domestic service, as personal servants, water-carriers, barbers, sweepers, washermen, &c.; 3,666 in commerce, in buying, selling, keeping or lending money or goods, or the conveyance of men, animals, or goods; 9,346 in agricultural operations; 6,920 in industrial occupations, arts and mechanics, and the preparation of all classes of substances, vegetable, mineral, and animal. There were 8,360 persons returned as labourers, and 894 as of no specified occupation. Taking the total population, irrespective of age or sex, the same returns give 1,890 as landholders, 24,684 as cultivators, and 83,193 as engaged in occupations unconnected with agriculture. The edu-\ncational statistics, which are confessedly imperfect, show 1,886 males as able to read and write out of a total male population numbering 58,942 souls.\n\nThis parganah received by transfer, in 1842, portions of taluka Patehar and parganahs Jah\u00e1ngirabad and Malhaipur, giving a land revenue of Rs. 16,537, and lost lands yielding a revenue of Rs. 50,939. The more important changes that took place in 1855 may be shown by the following table:\n\n| Transferred to | Received from |\n|---------------|--------------|\n| Names of parganahs | Number of vil. | Area in acres | Land revenue | Population | Names of parganahs | Number of vil. | Area in acres | Land revenue | Population |\n| Haraura       | 23           | 11,738        | 15,140       | 9,481       | Muzaffarabad     | 4            | 1,767         | 8,088       | 860         |\n| Muzaffarabad  | 8            | 5,716         | 4,563        | 2,810       | Bahat            | 1            | 1,339         | 5,466       | 3,318       |\n| Sar\u00e1wa        | 14           | 4,919         | 4,901        | 8,013       | Sult\u00e1npur        | 1            | 146           | 200         | 83          |\n| Sult\u00e1npur     | 2            | 915           | 1,830        | 1,128       | Faizabad         | 1            | 578           | 902         | 1,265       |\n| H\u00e1mpur        | 3            | 1,711         | 2,819        | 1,056       | K\u00e1mpe            | 5            | 2,428         | 3,123       | 1,737       |\n| Total         | 48           | 24,999        | 27,450       | 16,677      | Nak\u00far            | 2            | 1,737         | 2,038       | 1,533       |\n\nThis left 180 villages in the parganah, with a land revenue amounting to Rs. 93,226, an area of 81,279 acres, and a population numbering 95,201 souls.\n\nSah\u00e1r\u00e1npur, a tahsil in the district of the same name, comprises the parganahs of Sah\u00e1r\u00e1npur, Faizabad, Muzaffarabad, and Haraura. The total area, according to the census of 1872, contains 618 square miles, of which 328 square miles are cultivated. The area assessed to Government revenue is given at 441 square miles, of which 323 square miles are cultivated, 59 square miles are culturable, and 59 square miles are barren. The land revenue during the same year stood at Rs. 3,31,518 (or with cesses, Rs. 3,65,656), falling at Re. 0-13-5 per acre on the total area, Re. 1-2-10 per acre on the area assessed to Government revenue, and Rs. 1-9-8 on the cultivated acre. The population numbered 253,371 souls (116,360 females), giving 410 to the square mile, distributed amongst 523 villages. The same statistics show 11 persons insane, 2 idiots, 32 deaf and dumb, 267 blind, and 30 lepers in the tahsil. This tahsil lies in the centre of the district, running up on the north to the Siw\u00e1l\u00edk hills. Formerly there was an extensive forest on this side, but this has long been divided into grants and let out on clearing leases, most of which have now fallen into the hands of the Sah\u00e1r\u00e1npur money-lenders. The other matters pertaining to the history of this tahsil will be found in the district notice, or separately under each parganah.\nSAKRATDA, an old tappa of the Saharanpur district, which was separated from parganah Jaurasi and formed into a separate tappa by Rao Kutb-ud-din in the time of Zabita Khan. Sakrauda, with the adjacent hill tracts, remained in the possession of the descendants of Rao Kutb-ud-din until the settlement in 1838, when Mr. Thornton separated the waste from the cultivated lands, and broke up the tappa, distributing the villages between parganahs Jaurasi and Musaffarabad. The Raos of Sakrauda are Rajputs converted to Islam, and some account of them is given under the heads of 'waste lands' and 'old families' in the district notice. A full account of the arrangements made at the settlement under Regulation VII. of 1822 will be found in Mr. Thornton's report in I. Set. Rep., 90. These being of purely administrative interest, and already in an available form, need not be repeated here.\n\nSARSAWA or Sirsawa, the chief town of the parganah of the same name in the Saharanpur district, is situated on the road from Ambala to Saharanpur, 10\u00bd miles from Saharanpur and 14\u00bd miles from Jagadri. The population in 1865 was 3,706, and in 1872 numbered 3,433 souls. Sarsawa has a second-class police-station, a post-office, and a village school. Supplies are plentiful and water is abundant. Act XX. of 1856 (the Chaukidari Act) is in force, and in 1873 defrayed, from a house-tax, the cost (Rs. 504) of a village police numbering nine men. The total income from all sources in 1872-73 amounted to Rs. 1,250, giving an incidence of Re. 0-4-1 per head of the population, and Re. 1-6-4 per house. The site lies on the high land above the basin of the Jumna, and the houses, though for the most part built of mud, are kept in better repair than is usual in this district. A small trade to and from the Panjab passes through the town. Sarsawa has been identified with Sharwa, the city of Raja Chand in the eleventh century, and is noticed in the local history of the district (p. 245). Sarsawa forms a stage on the route via Saharanpur to Ambala (Umballa). From Saharanpur the road is metalled, and crosses the Karnal road and railway at two miles, and the Eastern Jumna Canal at 3\u00bd miles by a bridge. Hence to Jagadri the road is very heavy, and descends into the Jumna khadir, crossing that river by boats in the rains and by a bridge-of-boats in the dry season at 5\u00bd miles. The stone bench-mark of the Trigonometrical Survey, imbedded in front of the sarai doorway, is 896\u00b745 feet above the level of the sea.\n\nSARSAWA, a parganah of tahsil Nakur in the Saharanpur district, is bounded on the north by parganah Sultanpur, on the south by parganah Nakur, on the east by parganah Saharanpur, and on the west by the Jumna river. According to the census of 1872, parganah Sarsawa had a total area of 95 square miles, of which 70 square miles were under cultivation. The area assessed to Government revenue during the same year was 92 square miles, of which 69 square miles were cultivated, 14 square miles were culturable, and nine square miles were barren. The character and appearance of this parganah is in many respects\nsimilar to those to the north and south, and, like Sult\u00e1npur, it was divided into four groups for settlement purposes. In the first or canal-irrigated group the proprietors and cultivators are for the most part Gujars, but they are decidedly less industrious and less prosperous than their clansmen in the similarly situated group in Sult\u00e1npur. In the second group of upland villages the soil is, as a rule, light, but capable, with manure and water, of producing excellent rice. Patches of stiff d\u00e1k\u00e1r soil afford good crops without irrigation. Irrigation is easy, and earthen wells last from three to four years, with a depth of water from the surface of from nine to fifteen feet. Gujars, J\u0101ts and Mah\u0101jans own between them about two-thirds of this tract. The third group comprises the mixed upland and lowland villages, but possesses little khaddir, and this, too, is devoid of wells. In the b\u0101ngar portion the water is found at a depth from the surface varying from ten to sixteen feet. Here irrigation is deficient, earthen wells seldom last more than two years, and the subsoil is not retentive of moisture. The bulk of the villages in the north of the fourth or khaddir group belong to Rajputs, and in the south to Mahajans of Nakur. This group resembles the corresponding one in Sult\u00e1npur, except that there is much poor land in the villages bordering on the Jumna. Irrigation is very scanty, and the subsoil is not retentive of moisture. Water is found at a depth of from ten to fourteen feet from the surface, but earthen wells seldom last more than one year. The only want is a denser population and a greater expenditure of capital to bring this group up to the standard found in Sult\u00e1npur. There the population shows 516 souls to the square mile, here there are only 403. Wheat and rice are the principal crops throughout the whole parganah, though cotton and sugar-cane are also cultivated to some extent.\n\nThe last year of Mr. Thornton's settlement showed a land revenue of Rs. 60,883, increased to Rs. 62,687 by Mr. Vans Agnew. Mr. Wynne proposed an assessment of Rs. 69,804 on 59,683 acres, of which 53,947 acres were assessed to revenue, and of these 43,257 acres were cultivated. The actual land revenue for 1872 amounted to Rs. 63,462 (or with cesses, Rs. 69,935), falling at a rate of Re. 1-0-8 per British acre on the total area, at Re. 1-1-3 per acre on the area assessed to Government revenue, and at Re. 1-6-8 per acre on the cultivated area. The sum paid by cultivators to the landowners as rent and cesses during the same year has been estimated at Rs. 88,930.\n\nBetween the years 1839-40 and 1859-60 eight whole villages and 56 portions of villages, having an area of 5,840 acres, and paying a revenue of Rs. 7,486, and valued at Rs. 37,288, were transferred by private arrangement in this parganah. The transfers by decree of Court comprised 63 portions of villages, having an aggregate area of 4,163 acres, and paying a revenue of Rs. 5,500. The value recorded was Rs. 24,248. Out of the 32 whole and 85 portions of villages remaining with\nthe original proprietors, 278 acres, bearing a revenue of Rs. 265, valued at Rs. 1,600, of the former, and 1,542 acres, bearing a revenue of Rs. 1,526, valued at Rs. 15,753, of the latter, were under mortgage. These statistics give a percentage of private transfers to the total area of nine per cent., of transfers by decree of Court amounting to seven per cent., and of transfers by mortgage amounting to 18 per cent. The average value per acre in each of these cases was Rs. 6-6-0, Rs. 5-18-2, and Rs. 9-9-5, and the land revenue assessed amounted to Re. 1-5-0, Re. 1-6-3, and Re. 1-3-3 per acre respectively. The result from the entire parganah on 34 per cent. of the total area gives an average value of Rs. 4-7-6 per acre when the average land revenue amounted to Re. 0-14-0 per acre. Tagas lost eight villages, nearly all their possessions in this parganah.\n\nAccording to the census of 1872, parganah Sars\u00e1wa contained 93 inhabited villages, of which 32 had less than 200 inhabitants, Population. 37 had between 200 and 500, 17 had between 500 and 1,000, six had between 1,000 and 2,000, and one had between 3,000 and 5,000. The settlement records show 129 estates, of which five are held revenue-free in perpetuity. The total population in 1872 numbered 38,306 souls (17,157 females), giving 403 to the square mile. Classified according to religion, there were 28,705 Hind\u00fas, of whom 12,644 were females; and 9,601 Musalm\u00e1ns, amongst whom 4,513 were females. Distributing the Hindu population amongst the four great classes, the census shows 2,196 Brahmans, of whom 1,018 were females; 1,779 Rajp\u00fats, including 692 females; 1,694 Baniyas (803 females); whilst the great mass of the population is included in \"the other castes\" of the census returns, which show a total of 23,036 souls, of whom 10,131 are females. The principal Brahman sub-division found in this parganah is Gaur (1,978). The Rajp\u00fats belong to the Khagi (1,583) and Pundir clans, and the Baniyas are chiefly Agarw\u00e1ls (919). The other castes belong for the most part to the same classes mentioned under the notice of the Sult\u00e1npur parganah. Jul\u00e1has number 1,046 souls; Kah\u00e1rs, 1,715; Cham\u00e1rs, 6,214; Kh\u00e1krobs, 1,312; Guj\u00e1rs, 4,936; and M\u00e1lis, 1,692. Musalm\u00e1ns show 7,278 Shaikhs, 454 converted Pundirs, 1,026 converted Rajp\u00fats, and 787 Path\u00e1ns. The landholders are principally Guj\u00e1rs, Mah\u00e1jans, Sayyids, J\u00e1ts, G\u00e1r\u00e1s, and Rajp\u00fats, both Hindu and Musalm\u00e1n.\n\nThe occupations of the people are shown in the statistics collected at the census of 1872. From these it appears that, of the male adult population (not less than fifteen years of age), 463 are employed in professional avocations, such as Government servants, priests, doctors, and the like; 1,270 in domestic service, as personal servants, water-carriers, barbers, sweepers, washermen, &c.; 667 in commerce, in buying, selling, keeping or lending money or goods, or the conveyance of men, animals, or goods; 6,110 in agricultural operations; 1,749 in industrial occupations, arts and mechanics, and the preparation of all classes of substances,\nvegetable, mineral, and animal. There were 2,428 persons returned as labourers, and 312 as of no specified occupation. Taking the total population, irrespective of age or sex, the same returns give 273 as landholders, 16,525 as cultivators, and 21,508 as engaged in occupations unconnected with agriculture. The educational statistics, which are confessedly imperfect, show 6 males as able to read and write out of a total male population numbering 21,149 souls.\n\nSarsawa is one of the old Akbari parganahs. In 1840-41 it yielded a revenue of Rs. 56,440, and in the following year received lands assessed at Rs. 1,152, and lost others assessed at Rs. 8,072. In 1855 further changes took place, which are shown in the following table:\n\n| Transferred to | Received from |\n|----------------|---------------|\n| Names of parganahs | Number of vil. lages. | Area in acres. | Land revenue. | Population. | Names of parganahs | Number of vil. lages. | Area in acres. | Land revenue. | Population. |\n| Nakir          | ... | 3 | 637 | 970 | 413 | Nakir          | ... | 46 | 32,924 | 31,359 | 10,68 |\n| Saharanpur     | ... | 44 | 30,431 | 18,350 | 11,653 | Saharanpur     | ... | 14 | 4,919 | 6,001 | 1,031 |\n|                | Musafarabad   | ... | 1 | 109 | 50 | Sultapur       | ... | 1 | 631 | 750 | 38 |\n\nThis left in the parganah in 1855 an area of 60,536 acres, assessed at Rs. 59,570, and distributed amongst 127 villages.\n\nShaikepura, a village in parganah Saharanpur of the Saharanpur district, lies four miles south-east of Saharanpur town on the road to Deoband. The population in 1872 numbered 2,767 souls.\n\nShiuipuri, a station of the Great Trigonometrical Survey in parganah Rurki of the Saharanpur district, lies in latitude 29\u00b0-19\u2032 and longitude 78\u00b0-1\u2032-59\u2032 at an elevation of 870-7 feet above the level of the sea. The upper markstone is on an elevated earthen mound on the high bank which bounds the bed of the Ganges to the western side, apparently the site of a ruined fort. The village of Shiuipuri lies to the west, about half a mile from the station of Gangadaspur close by, and Mirapur south-east, three miles. This height was deduced trigonometrically.\n\nSikandarpur, a village in parganah Bhagwanpur of the Saharanpur district, on the road from Saharanpur to Rurki, is distant 14 miles from the former, and 9\u00bd miles from the latter town. The population in 1872 numbered 1,160 souls. Supplies and water are procurable, and the encamping-ground is good. Road from Rurki metalled for seven miles, remainder good; it crosses the canal close to Rurki by a bridge, passes Rampur at 1\u00bd miles, and Bhagwanpur at 6\u00bd miles. From Sikandarpur to Saharanpur the road is rather good, and crosses the Kali close to the village, the Hindan at 7\u00bd miles, and the Nagdeo\nat 11 miles. The two latter are bridged, and are also fordable except after heavy rain; the K\u00e1li is unbridged. The district officers say that the better encamping-ground is at Umarpur Begampur, a small village of 324 inhabitants, 12 miles from Sah\u00e1ranpur and 11\u00bd miles from R\u00fark\u00ed.\n\nSULT\u00c1NPUR, the chief town of the parganah of the same name in the Sah\u00e1ranpur district, is distant about nine miles north-west from Sah\u00e1ranpur. The population in 1872 numbered 3,022 souls. Sult\u00e1npur and Chilk\u00e1na have between them one village school, and are also united for the purposes of the Chaukid\u00e1ri Act (XX. of 1856). From this source a village police, numbering 16 men of all grades, was entertained in both villages in 1872, the cost of whom, amounting to Rs 882, was defrayed from a house-tax. Sult\u00e1npur is noted for the number and wealth of its Jain or Sarangi residents, who carry on a considerable trade in sugar and salt with the Panj\u00e1b. It is said to have been founded by Sult\u00e1n Bahlol Lodi in 1450-1488 A.D.\n\nSULT\u00c1NPUR, a parganah of tahsil Nak\u00far in the Sah\u00e1ranpur district, is bounded on the north by parganah Faizabad, on the west by the Jumna which separates it from the Amb\u00e1l\u00e1 district of the Panj\u00e1b, on the south by parganah Sars\u00e1wa, and on the east by parganah Sah\u00e1ranpur. According to the census of 1872, parganah Sult\u00e1npur had a total area of 88 square miles, of which 67 square miles were under cultivation. The area assessed to Government revenue during the same year was 87 square miles, of which 67 square miles were cultivated, 9 square miles were culturable, and 11 square miles were barren. This parganah may be broadly divided into two tracts,\u2014the one lying in the kh\u00e1dir of the Jumna, and the other on the bangar or upland. For settlement purposes the villages were distributed into four groups. The first comprised the villages watered by the Jumna Canal. Mahesri and Badgaon, the two most northern of these, are intersected by the bank separating the upland from the basin of the Maskhara river, and grow some of the best rice in the district. Hence, too, a ridge of red sand runs southward, to the east of which is a fine strip of d\u00e1kar soil. To the west and on the bangar bank the soil is poor and light. To the south the land abruptly sinks to the Sikri swamp, a great rice-growing tract. Water along the ridge is found at 17 to 18 feet from the surface, and elsewhere at from 6 to 10 feet. Earthen temporary wells can easily be dug, but have been seldom used since the introduction of canal irrigation. The sugar-cane and rice grown here are some of the best of their kind; the cotton and wheat, though a little inferior to that found elsewhere, are still excellent.\n\nThe second group comprises those villages having portions of both bangar and kh\u00e1dir lands. In them the kh\u00e1dir produce the best rice in the district. Much land on the bank of the B\u00fadhi N\u00e1l\u00e1 is kept as a reed and grass preserve, which at certain seasons are cut down and sold in Sah\u00e1ranpur. The soil of the bangar portion is very light and poor. The subsoil, too, unlike the upland\ngroup, is not retentive of moisture, and earthen wells can only be dug with difficulty. This, added to the fact that the proprietors are either money-lenders or non-resident Sayyids, will account for the backwardness of these villages when compared with those in the neighbourhood. The third group, or those villages lying in the basin of the Sikri swamp, formerly belonged to Sayyid Zamin Ali of Chilkana, but they have long gone out of the possession of his family. The irrigation here is wholly from wells, which are easily dug and last two or three seasons. The fourth group comprises the khaddir villages, where the Gujars predominate both as cultivators and proprietors, and are fairly prosperous and industrious. Except in the high, sandy tract near Gorakhpur, irrigation even from wells is hardly necessary or resorted to in this group. The subsoil consists of a friable blue soil, which would in any case prevent the construction of other than brick-built wells here.\n\nThe last year of Mr. Thornton's settlement showed a land revenue of Rs. 51,205, which was increased by Mr. VansAgnew to Rs. 57,021, and revised by Mr. Wynne, who proposed a revenue of Rs. 67,052, on a total area amounting to 56,717 acres, of which 49,632 acres were assessed to Government revenue, and of these 40,329 acres were cultivated. The actual land revenue for 1872 amounted to Rs. 61,997 (or with cesses, Rs. 67,205), falling at a rate of Re. 1-1-4 per British acre on the area assessed to Government revenue, and at Re. 1-15-9 per acre on the cultivated area. The sum paid by cultivators to the landowners as rent and cesses during the same year has been estimated at Rs. 88,608.\n\nBetween the years 1839-40 and 1859-60 two whole villages and 56 portions of villages, having an area of 4,564 acres, and paying a revenue of Rs. 4,608, and valued at Rs. 37,620, were transferred by private arrangement in this parganah. The transfers by decree of Court comprised three entire villages and 76 portions of villages, having an aggregate area of 10,592 acres, and paying a revenue of Rs. 9,527. The value recorded was Rs. 42,131. Out of the 30 whole and 86 portions of villages remaining with the original proprietors, 266 acres, bearing a revenue of Rs. 309, valued at Rs. 2,515, of the former, and 5,813 acres, bearing a revenue of Rs. 5,538, valued at Rs. 45,743, of the latter, were under mortgage. These statistics give a percentage of private transfers to the total area of eight per cent., of transfers by decree of Court amounting to 18 per cent., and of transfers by mortgage amounting to 11 per cent. The average value per acre in each of these cases was Rs. 8-3-11, Rs. 3-15-7, and Rs. 7-14-9, and the land revenue assessed amounted to Re. 1-0-1, Re. 0-14-6, and Re. 0-15-5 per acre respectively. The result from the entire parganah on 37 per cent. of the total area gives an average value of Rs. 6-0-5 per acre when the average land-revenue amounted to Re. 0-15-0 per acre. Pathans and Guras were the principal losers. Gujars hold twelve entire villages; Tagas, one; Pathans, one; and Hindu Rajputs, two.\nAccording to the census of 1872, parganah Sult\u00e1npur contained 102 inhabited villages, of which 39 had less than 200 inhabitants, 37 had between 200 and 500, 18 had between 500 and 1,000, six had between 1,000 and 2,000, one had between 2,000 and 3,000, and one had between 3,000 and 5,000. There were 121 estates at the time of settlement, all of which paid land revenue to Government. The total population in 1872 numbered 45,378 souls (20,918 females), giving 516 to the square mile. Classified according to religion, there were 24,244 Hind\u00fas, of whom 11,498 were females; and 20,134 Musalm\u00e1ns, amongst whom 9,420 were females. Distributing the Hindu population amongst the four great classes, the census shows 1,527 Brahmans, of whom 706 were females; 51 Rajp\u00fate, including 13 females; 2,045 Baniyas (980 females); whilst the great mass of the population is included in \"the other castes\" of the census returns, which show a total of 21,621 souls, of whom 9,799 are females. The only Brahman sub-division found in this parganah is the Gaur, and the Baniyas belong to the Agarw\u00e1l (1,667) and Jaini divisions. Amongst the other castes the following sub-divisions are found:\u2014Jul\u00e1ha (561), Jogi, Kumb\u00e1r (799), Hajj\u00e1m, Kah\u00e1r (2,324), Cham\u00e1r (7,381), Kh\u00e1krob (1,039), Guj\u00e1r (2,537), Barhai (803), Loh\u00e1r, Bair\u00e1g\u00ed, Garariya, Darzi, Koli, M\u00e1li (1,672), Dhobi, Bhat, J\u00e1t (549), Chhip\u00ed, Son\u00e1r, Bharbhunja, Kulw\u00e1r, Gos\u00e1in, Taga, Kamboh, Kayath, Bohra, Ahir, Khat\u00edk, Lodha, and Banj\u00e1ra. The Musalm\u00e1ns show Shaikhs (495), Pundirs, Chauh\u00e1ns, and Path\u00e1ns (794); the remainder are entered without distinction. The principal landholders are Mah\u00e1jans, Gujars, G\u00e1ras, Path\u00e1ns, Tagas, and Sayyids.\n\nThe occupations of the people are shown in the statistics collected at the census of 1872. From these it appears that, of the male adult population (not less than fifteen years of age), 527 are employed in professional avocations, such as Government servants, priests, doctors, and the like; 1,294 in domestic service, as personal servants, water-carriers, barbers, sweepers, washermen, &c.; 840 in commerce, in buying, selling, keeping or lending money or goods, or the conveyance of men, animals, or goods; 6,258 in agricultural operations; 2,394 in industrial occupations, arts and mechanics, and the preparation of all classes of substances, vegetable, mineral, and animal. There were 3,521 persons returned as labourers, and 358 as of no specified occupation. Taking the total population, irrespective of age or sex, the same returns give 1,232 as landholders, 16,685 as cultivators, and 27,461 as engaged in occupations unconnected with agriculture. The educational statistics, which are confessedly imperfect, show 489 males as able to read and write out of a total male population numbering 24,460 souls.\n\nSult\u00e1npur, or Sult\u00e1npur Bahat of Shahjah\u00e1n's reign, represents the Bahat Kanj\u00e1war of the \u00c1\u00edn-i-Akbari. Bahat and Sult\u00e1npur were made separate parganahs in the time of Najib.\nKh\u00e1n, and remained separate thereafter. In 1840-41, Sult\u00e1npur yielded a land revenue, amounting to Rs. 39,674. This was increased by the transfer from other parganahs of villages assessed at Rs. 23,007 in 1842, and it also then lost villages assessed at Rs. 24,804. Further changes took place in 1855, which are shown in the following table:\n\n| Name of parganah | Number of vil. | Area in acres | Land revenue | Population |\n|------------------|---------------|---------------|--------------|------------|\n| Faizabad         | 3             | 2,231         | 2,366        | 1,366      |\n| Sah\u00e1ranpur       | 1             | 146           | 200          | 83         |\n| Saraw\u00e1           | 1             | 631           | 750          | 256        |\n\n| Name of parganah | Number of vil. | Area in acres | Land revenue | Population |\n|------------------|---------------|---------------|--------------|------------|\n| Rahat            | 1             | 387           | 265          | 81         |\n| Saraw\u00e1           | 44            | 20,491        | 18,330       | 11,62      |\n| Sah\u00e1ranpur       | 3             | 915           | 1,330        | 1,113      |\n\nTotal | 5 | 3,013 | 3,316 | 1,705 | Total | 47 | 21,663 | 19,645 | 13,89 |\n\nThis left in 1855 an area of 57,043 acres, assessed at Rs. 54,717, and distributed amongst 120 villages.\n\nTH\u00c1NA BH\u00c1WAN, or Th\u00e1na Bh\u00edm, was an old Akbari parganah formerly belonging to the Sah\u00e1ranpur district. It received portions of N\u00e1nauts, and in 1840-41 yielded a revenue of Rs. 72,030. In the following year eighty villages were transferred to the Muzaffarnagar district, and the remainder was distributed amongst other parganahs.\n\nT\u00edtron, a village in parganah Gangoh of the Sah\u00e1ranpur district, is distant 26 miles south-east from Sah\u00e1ranpur. The population in 1872 numbered 3,825 souls, chiefly G\u00fajars and Path\u00e1ns. T\u00edtron lies on the road between Sah\u00e1ranpur and P\u00e1nipat, and possesses a post-office and a village school. Act XI. of 1856 (the Chankid\u00e1ri Act) is in force, and in 1873 supported a village police numbering eleven men, at an annual cost of Rs. 612, which is defrayed from a house-tax. The total income from all sources in 1872-73 amounted to Rs. 1,956, giving an incidence of Re. 0-6-4 per head of the population, and Re. 1-10-2 per house. During the same year one-fifth of the collections was expended upon works of public utility, such as drains, culverts, and roads. The neighbourhood of T\u00edtron is celebrated for its excellent sugar-cane of the species known as merthi. The town is situated to the west of the K\u00e1tha Nadi about 1\u00bd miles, but close by there is a canal distributary. The site is raised and the streets slope down to the outskirt, so the surface drainage is good and the soil in general is clayey and retentive. To the north-east is a large extent of swamp covering one hundred acres and lying between the canal and the K\u00e1tha. The water level in wells in low ground is about six feet, and in high ground about twenty feet from the surface. Many of the wells and houses are built of brick, and some of the streets are paved with brick and sloped towards a narrow central drain. The town has improved very much of late years, and the reputation that it once possessed for unhealthiness is no longer justly due to it.\nDistrict of ALIGARH\n\nScale 8 Br.

The Eta parganahs on the east are Faizpur Badariya, Pachlana, Bilram, and Maha. The Jumna separates the Tappal parganah of this district from the Palwal parganah of Gurgaon on the west; and the Noh Jhil and Mat parganahs of Muttra also lie on the western boundary. Parganahs Mahaban and Sadabad of Muttra and Jalesar of Agra form the southern boundary. The district lies between north latitude 27\u00b0-29' to 28\u00b0-10'-30\", and east longitude 77\u00b0-32'-30\" to 78\u00b0-42'-30\", with an area of 1,957-41 square miles, or 1,252,747 statute acres, of which 897,172 acres are cultivated, 121,168 acres are culturable, 20,165 acres are held free of land revenue, and 214,242 acres are barren. The population in 1865 numbered 926,538 souls, and in 1872 there were 1,073,108 inhabitants, giving 546 to the square mile. The extreme length from north to south is 45 miles, with an average length of 40 miles; the greatest breadth from east to west is about 70 miles, with an average breadth of 50 miles. The shape of the district is somewhat that of an irregular hexagon, the rivers Jumna and Ganges, opposite each other, forming the two shortest sides.\n\nThe following table gives the existing administrative sub-divisions of the district, with statistics of their area, revenue, and population:\n\n| Present Tahsil | Parganah | Entered in the Ain-i-Akbari in | Number of estates in 1874 | Land revenue in 1874 | Area in acres in 1874 | Population in 1874 | In the Police jurisdiction of station |\n|----------------|----------|-------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| L\u2014Koli         | 1.

It was also bound to furnish a contingent of 4,035 cavalry and 78,950 infantry.

Saidhupur is the same as Sirhpura, and Malakpur or Malikpur has been converted into An\u00fapshahr since the time of Shahjah\u00e1n. The changes that have occurred since the Musalm\u00e1n occupation may be briefly noticed here. In 1802, by the treaty of Faizabad, the British frontier came within fifteen miles of Koil, and included parganahs Sikandra Rao, M\u00e1rahra, Akbarabad, Jal\u00e1l\u00ed, Pachl\u00e1na, and Gangfri. On the fall of Aligarh, on the 4th September, 1803, the territories to the north as far as the Siw\u00e1liks, and to the east as far as the S\u00e1rda, fell into the hands of the British. On the 2nd of October of the same year, Mr. R. Cunynghame, Collector of Et\u00e1wa; Mr. Leycester, Collector of Moradabad; and Mr. Claude Russell, Governor-General's Agent at Farukhabad, were directed to distribute the conquered territory into three divisions, and attach one division to each of their respective districts, in order to commence the settlement.\u00b9 The Collectors met at Koil on the 28th of October, and, modifying the instructions received by them, submitted to Lord Lake, as Commander-in-Chief, statements of a proposed division into four portions of the conquered districts. The first portion comprised the present districts of Sah\u00e1ranpur, Muzaffarnagar, and the parganahs in the neighbourhood of Meerut and H\u00e1pur, containing altogether fifty-three mah\u00e1ls or parganahs. The second portion included Kh\u00farja, Sikandarabad, Baran, Shik\u00e1rpur, D\u00e1dri, D\u00e1sma, K\u00e1sma, Dankaur, Gh\u00e1zi-ud-dinnagar (Gh\u00e1z\u00edabad), Begamabad, Malikpur, Garhmuktesar, and some other neighbouring parganahs, amounting altogether to thirty mah\u00e1ls. The third portion, to be attached to Fatehgarh, contained Koil, including Kanka, Atrauli, Dib\u00e1i, Chharra, Bhamauri, Pindr\u00e1wal, Khair, Noh, Chandaus, Barauli, Murthal, and Pitampur, altogether twelve mah\u00e1ls. The fourth portion, to be attached to Et\u00e1wa, included Firuzabad, Sadabad, Sahpu, Khandauli, R\u00e9ya, Jo\u00e1r, Murs\u00e1n, M\u00e1t, Mah\u00e1b\u00e1n, Hasangarh, Gorai, Husain, Tuks\u00e1n, H\u00e1thras, Jalesar, Khal\u00edlganj, Daryapur, Moheriya, and Sonri, or fifteen mah\u00e1ls. The third and fourth divisions were sanctioned at once; the second was placed under charge of Colonel Ochterlony, the Resident at Dehli; and the first was sub-divided into the northern and southern divisions, the latter of which was annexed to the Moradabad district.\u00b2\n\nIn 1804 the Aligarh district was formed by the union of the second, third, and fourth divisions, with the addition of parganah An\u00fapshahr from Moradabad\u00b3 and parganah Sikandra Rao from Et\u00e1wa; and on the 1st of August, 1804, Mr. C. Russell was appointed Collector of the new district. In 1816 the K\u00e1sganj tahsil, comprising parganahs\u2074 Bilr\u00e1n, Faizpur Badariya, Soron, and half M\u00e1rahra, were annexed to Aligarh from Et\u00e1wa, and Firuzabad, Khandauli, and\n\n\u00b9 For a more detailed account of the several parganahs see the alphabetical arrangement following the district notice. \u00b2 November 4, 1803. \u00b3 Board's Records, 18th February, 1805, No. 19, Et\u00e1wa transfers; Ibid., 28th July, 1809, No. 33; and 8th August, 1809, No. 16. \u2074 Ibid., 31st December, 1816, No. 16.\nSabpu were transferred to Agra. In 1818 A.D., Ah\u00e1r Tilbegampur, Sikandarabad, Dankaur, K\u00e1sna, Baran, M\u00e1l\u00e1garh (Agauta), and Malikpur were transferred to Meerut. The next great change occurred in 1824, when parganahs Bilram, Faizpur Badariya, Soron, and half of M\u00e1rahra were annexed to the newly created district of Sabiswan, now known as Budson. Parganahs Sadabad, Sikandra Rao, Mahaban, Mat, Sonai, Raya, Jalesar, Awa Misa, and Noh Jhil were transferred to the newly-created district of Sadabad, now known as Muttra; and parganahs Dibai, Shikarpur, Anupshahr, Jahangirabad, Khurja, half Pitampur, and Ahmadgarh were transferred to the newly created district of Bulandshahr.\n\nIn 1828-29 parganahs Somna and Chandaus were transferred to Bulandshahr, but were re-annexed to Aligarh two years afterwards. Parganah Sikandra Rao was also re-annexed from Sadabad in 1832-33, and half of M\u00e1rahra from Fatehgarh in 1837. The Budaon parganahs were shortly afterwards transferred to Fatehgarh, but were re-annexed to Budaon in 1837, and again separated in 1845 and attached to the Patiali sub-division (now Eta), to which M\u00e1rahra and Pachlana were transferred in 1856. In 1854, 17 villages from Barauli and one from Atrauli were transferred to Bulandshahr. Of the parganahs appearing in the present list, Koil, Atrauli, Gangiri, Sikandra, Tappal, and Chandaus were in existence in the time of Akbar. The origin of Mursan and Hatha has been explained. Khair, Hasangarh, Gorai, Murthal, and Barauli are talukas detached from Koil, and Akbarabad is the modern rendering of Akbarabad.\n\nThere were originally two Sadr Amims, besides the covenanted Judge and Civil administration. Registers (Registrars), for the trial of civil suits. The latter were salaried officers, and the former received each Rs. 50 a month besides the institution fees until 1815, when, by section 49 of Regulation XXIII., 1814, the remuneration for themselves and their establishments was confined to the value of the stamps on the plaints in cases decided on the merits or by compromise. In 1816 the Judge reported these as amounting to Rs. 927 only, of which Rs. 600 were disbursed for establishment, leaving only Rs. 27 a month to the Sadr Amims. In 1815 munsifs were appointed under Regulation XXIII., 1814, instead of k\u00e1zis or native commissioners, and were remunerated by institution fees. They were appointed to eleven stations,\u2014Sikandarabad, Bulandshahr, Khurja, Anupshahr, and Dibai, now in the Bulandshahr district; Atrauli, Khair, Kauriyaganj, and Sikandra Rao, now in Aligarh; Jalesar, now in Agra; and Mahaban, now in Muttra. The number of munsifs was shortly afterwards reduced to eight. In 1833 there were seven munsifs,\u2014Koil, Khair, Atrauli, Hatha, Kasganj, Raya, and Jalesar. In 1846 the two last were removed to Agra. In 1856 the munsifs in Aligarh were\n\n---\n\n1 Board's Records, 4th August, 1818.\n2 Ibid, 15th September, 1823, No. 21; 27th February, 1824, No. 1; 23rd June, 1829, No. 1.\n3 Ibid, 4th August, 1828, No. 2.\nKoil, Atrauli, Khair, H\u00e1thras, and K\u00e1sanj; the last was transferred to Etia in the same year. At present there are four of these courts of original civil jurisdiction, viz., Akrabad, Koil, Khair, and H\u00e1thras. The munsif of Akrabad has jurisdiction over tahsil Atrauli, parganah Akrabad, and part of Sikandra Rao; the munsif of Koil over tahsil Koil; the munsif of Khair over tahsils Khair and Ig\u00edas; and the munsif of H\u00e1thras over tahsil H\u00e1thras and portions of Sikandra Rao. The Judge of Aligarh has appellate civil and criminal jurisdiction, and original criminal jurisdiction in sessions cases throughout the district.\n\nThe number and distribution of the magisterial and other courts and officers from 1803 to 1855 have been given in detail in Mr. Hutchinson's Memoir. In 1860-61 there were 21 magisterial courts, 12 civil and revenue courts, and five covenanted officers serving in the district; in 1870-71 the numbers were 25, 13, and 6 respectively. The revenue and magisterial staff in 1874 consisted of a Magistrate-Collector and his Assistant, five Deputy Collectors, six tahald\u00e1rs, three of whom have revenue powers and magisterial powers of the second class, and six Honorary Magistrates. There is also a Deputy Inspector of Customs and of Schools, an Inspector of Post-offices, District Superintendent of Police, and a Civil Surgeon, besides the railway staff and the officers of the Canal and Public Works Departments.\n\nThe district consists of one vast plain drained by six streams, and possesses no natural inequality of surface nor any artificial one of General appearance. The height of the Du\u00e1b at Somna is 622\u00b731 feet above the level of the sea, at H\u00e1thras it is 586\u00b701 feet, and at Ali-garh 605\u00b785 feet. Where the Ganges and Jumna bound the district there are tracts of low-lying land, rich and well cultivated, and for the most part dry, except in the rains. The old bed of the Ganges is known as the B\u00farh Gang\u00e1, besides the term kh\u00e1dir commonly applied to such lands. To the south of the district there is no kh\u00e1dir, and altogether the kh\u00e1dir of the great rivers comprises no more than nine entire villages and portions of eleven others on the Jumna side, and eighteen entire villages with portions of twelve others on the Ganges side; with a river frontage on the west of about twelve miles, and on the east of about ten miles. On the Jumna the kh\u00e1dir is well raised and but little subject to inundation, whilst on the Ganges it is lower, and its appearance changes with the floods of almost every year. From the Ganges and the Jumna the land rises, at first abruptly, and afterwards gradually, to the watershed along which passes the Ganges Canal. Taking a section of the country from east to west the change in elevation is well marked by the high bank of the Ganges, to the west of which the heights are only varied by the depressions through which the smaller streams flow southward.\nThe following table of ascertained heights above the level of the sea in this district is compiled from the records of the Great Trigonometrical Survey.

To the north-east, in parganah Atrauli, the land bordering the Ganges possesses a more or less sandy soil. To the west, along the high bank of the Jumna, the soil is sandy for a few miles, but then comes pure loam, and wherever sand occurs it appears in the form of high ridges or hillocks, running from north to south in irregular lines, sometimes interrupted for a space, but traceable throughout. Thus three ridges run through the Khair tahsil; the western ridge forms the natural boundary between Tappal and Chandaus; the middle ridge follows the line of the Karwan; and the eastern ridge is less defined and most interrupted. All three ridges are continued through the upper portion of Igl\u00e1s, and two of them extend into Murs\u00e1n. Occasional spurs are thrown off from these lines of sand, and gradually intermingle with the plain. In the other tahsils there are tracts of land of varying extent, but none in any way remarkable and with irrigation the soil is always fertile. To the north the eastern tracts are inferior to the western, and neither are so fertile as the tracts to the south. The substratum is entirely kunkur,\u2014a formation composed of nodules of impure carbonate of lime, which is found everywhere at a few feet below the surface, and in several places crops out even at the surface. In many cases it takes the form of blocks, and is used for building purposes, and in the form of coarse gravel for metalling roads.\n\nThe conventional distribution of soils in this district comprises (1) b\u00e1ra, or the lands immediately adjoining the village site, and highly cultivated and manured; (2) those more distant, known as manjha (middle); and (3) the outlying lands called barh\u00e1. The natural classification of soils is into dum\u00e1t, mattiy\u00e1r, bh\u00e9r, and plliya or sand. At the recent settlement, the soil was divided into seven classes for settlement purposes, viz., b\u00e1ra\u2014irrigated (ch\u00e1hi), and unirrigated (kh\u00e1ki)\u2014comprising the manured land around the village site; manjha, irrigated and unirrigated, the manured fields between the b\u00e1ra and the unmanured outlying lands; barh\u00e1, the outlying lands which are always unmanured, divided into irrigated and unirrigated. The unirrigated barh\u00e1 is sub-divided, according to quality and consistency of land, into four classes:\u2014chiknot (clay), mattiy\u00e1r (loam), plliya (light sandy loam), and bh\u00e9r (sand). Though almost all irrigated barh\u00e1 is of equal value as to productive power, unirrigated barh\u00e1 presents marked differences in quality. So little, however, exists between unirrigated chiknot and mattiy\u00e1r and between bh\u00e9r and plliya, that the two former constitute the first class, and the latter form the second class unirrigated barh\u00e1 of the settlement records. These artificial distinctions are well understood by the people, and form the foundation of their own system of assessment of rents. The following statement gives the soil areas of the cultivated area.\nALIGARH DISTRICT.\n\nin acres by parganahs for the whole district, as ascertained at the recent settlement:\n\n| Parganahs | Irrigated | Unirrigated | Total |\n|-----------|-----------|-------------|-------|\n|           | Bkra.     | Manjha.     | Bath\u00e1 (I). | Total. | Bath\u00e1 (II). | Total. | Total cultivated area. |\n| Atrauli   | 3,032     | 3,659       | 38,919    | 40,590 | 350         | 373     | 611,419 | 617,992 | 30,137 | 70,727 |\n| Gangfri   | 3,176     | 3,690       | 25,950    | 32,816 | 495         | 819     | c12,390 | d83,058 | 46,762 | 79,578 |\n| Hasangarh | 4,600     | 5,170       | 40,904    | 50,684 | 41          | 75      | 5,979   | 12,108  | 18,303 | 68,897 |\n| Gorai     | 3,182     | 4,047       | 31,659    | 35,888 | 34          | 74      | 4,604   | 5,060   | 9,772  | 48,660 |\n| Akrambad  | 2,746     | 3,425       | 39,464    | 45,635 | 81          | 28      | 1,003   | 2,654   | 4,371  | 49,852 |\n| Sikandra  | 7,024     | 8,146       | 60,960    | 75,130 | 24          | 54      | 5,175   | 3,616   | 5,710  | 40,457 |\n| Paramuli  | 385       | 454         | 5,888     | 6,397  | 18          | 18      | 2,968   | 3,787   | 4,106  | 10,903 |\n| Koli      | 6,846     | 7,778       | 77,856    | 91,849 | 77          | 146     | 12,693  | 11,187  | 24,108 | 110,068 |\n| Morthal   | 1,098     | 1,177       | 15,749    | 21,084 | 80          | 48      | 1,820   | 2,679   | 4,677  | 26,601 |\n| Tappal    | 2,899     | 2,703       | 26,275    | 31,877 | 129         | 196     | 22,378  | 14,092  | 36,189 | 68,166 |\n| Chandaus | 1,754     | 2,020       | 20,000    | 23,783 | 47          | 57      | 9,833   | 9,807   | 19,644 | 48,027 |\n| Khair     | 8,657     | 4,799       | 86,998    | 44,754 | 76          | 208     | 15,431  | 15,830  | 31,030 | 76,790 |\n| Murshin   | 4,336     | 5,026       | 35,388    | 40,751 | 40          | 56      | 743     | 2,856   | 3,199  | 38,905 |\n| H\u0101thras   | 9,505     | 11,126      | 79,530    | 100,161| 40          | 56      | 4,077   | 2,788   | 7,865  | 107,171 |\n\nTotal | 53,402 | 63,465 | 531,946 | 649,115 | 1,489 | 2,825 | 110,437 | 184,213 | 248,357 | 897,173 |\n\nExtensive plains or tracts of barren land, impregnated with noxious salts, and known as *usar* or *reh* lands, occur on or near the watersheds of the district, and always close to good loam or clay soil. One irregular line of *usar* soil follows the line of the main canal, and is continued between the two branches of the canal, which bifurcate at N\u0101nu, on into the adjacent district. Another line of *usar* runs north and south along the watershed between the Nim and the K\u0101li; and a third line takes a course between the sandy tract near the Jumna in Khair and the Karwan Nadi. To the north of the H\u0101thras tahsil there are a few detached *usar* plains, but to the south and in Igl\u00e1s they are practically absent. These plains are now, and have always been, unculturable. Regarding the spread of *usar* in this district Mr. W. H. Smith writes:\n\n\"The results of an observation of some years lead me to the opinion that in the dry tracts, where well irrigation alone is possible, and where the soil is subject only to the natural action of the seasons, it has never manifested any signs of a liability to spread. Both the old maps and the statements of the people agree in showing that to this day there are the same patches, within exactly the same limits, as were observable at last settlement, nearly 40 years\n\n---\n\na includes 374 acres 1st class khaddir.  \nb includes 437 acres 2nd class khaddir.  \nc includes 1,003 acres 1st class khaddir.  \nd includes 1,613 acres 2nd class khaddir.\nago. No change is known to have taken place in this long period. It is in tracts near the Ganges Canal that a very different state of things appears to have arisen since the canal has been opened. What has happened to a small extent near the K\u00e1l\u00ed N\u00e1di has occurred to a considerable extent in some parts adjacent to the canal, and from apparently similar causes. There is and must be a considerable amount of percolation from so large a body of water, flowing at so high a level, and the line of usar plain runs almost parallel with the parent canal in the Koil tahsil, and in Sikandra Rao actually between the two branches. At present, however, the total income of the proprietors has been so much increased by the means of additional irrigation supplied by the canal, insomuch that the whole area perhaps is now watered when formerly not half was irrigated, that the damage is scarcely, if at all, felt. But if the present state of things continues, it seems to me to follow that a great part of the tract must become waste, and with a reduced culturable area, there will be considerable loss both to the State and the proprietor. In the Koil tahsil, where there is only one canal channel, the increase of usar is comparatively insignificant, and is confined almost wholly to low lands near jhils. The appearance presented by the 'reh' on the tracts where it is increasing is very singular. It forms a white crust on the ground, and the plains on which it lies stand out from the landscape glistening white in the sun, like snow on a bright winter's day in England. After rain it renders the ground so slippery as to be almost impassable. In the drier tracts the 'reh' rarely exudes, and there is no white incrustation. But even grass refuses to grow on the soil it frequents, and an almost complete absence of vegetation marks its presence.\"\n\nThe district is partly bounded on the east by the Ganges, and on the west by the Jumna. The character of these rivers present no peculiar features in this district. The former touches parganah Atrauli, and the latter borders on parganah Tappal. The Jumna kh\u00e1dir has here a breadth of about six miles, which is largely used for grazing purposes. There are thousands of acres of cultivation, but the land, as a rule, is inferior in quality to the uplands of the interior. The Ganges bed, especially that portion known as the B\u00farh Ganga, is little better, containing for the most part an excessive proportion of sandy and unirrigated land. There are ferries across the Ganges at S\u00e1nkra or S\u00e1nkura and Dinapur in the Atrauli tahsil; across the Jumna at L\u00e1lpur in parganah Tappal, leading to Biloipur in parganah Palwal in the Gurgaon district; and at Antasani, leading to Mahiw\u00e1la. The Jumna kh\u00e1dir is so raised as to be almost above the level of the highest floods, except such an exceptional one as that of 1871, which continued during the whole of August. The Ganges kh\u00e1dir is low, and the deep stream continually changes from one side to the other;\u2014one year it lies under the Budaon\nside, and the next year, perhaps two miles away, close under the high land at S\u00e1nkura on the Aligarh side. Old land is constantly cut away, and new land is formed every year. The fresh soil is not at once fit for cultivation, and the alluvial deposits of several years are required to render it available for the plough; it is then, however, singularly fertile. The permanency of the Jumna kh\u00e1dir always ensures a crop, and therefore, though the culturable land is of inferior quality, rents are higher than along the Ganges. The B\u00farh Ganga or old bed of the Gangee is dry in this district, except during the rains.\n\nThe head-waters of the Rind are closely connected with those of the Sengar, and collect between the Cawnpore and Et\u00e1wa terminal branches of the Ganges Canal, close to their bifurcation from the main branch at N\u00e1nu. The principal sources of the Rind are a series of hollows containing water, which lie near the fourth, sixth, and ninth miles of the Cawnpore branch of the canal. The hollow at the fourth mile, near the village of Ladhawa, is the most distinct, and is traceable to a set of shallow depressions which lie to the north of N\u00e1nu. From these jhils or hollows the drainage appears to pass around by Akrabad to the west of Ladhawa. It then crosses the line of the canal, and sweeping around the village of Kanakpur in a defined line of water-course, assumes under that shape the name of Rind. The maximum depth of the main hollows lying to the north of N\u00e1nu, and which form the true Rind, is only three feet below the surface of the neighbouring country, whilst in its course around Akrabad and Ladhawa it does not exceed twelve inches in depth. At the sixth mile of the canal, near Gopi and Rudain, the hollow is of the same character in its immediate junction with the canal, and the drainage passes off towards the Rind without any perceptible depression. The hollow at the ninth mile, near Ginauli, is less extensive, and drains into the Rind. To the west of the N\u00e1nu branch of the Rind, and close to the village of Sah\u00e1oli, lies a depression which is so intimately connected with the head-waters of both the Rind and Sengar, that not even the most careful examination could discover the difference, or lead to any other conclusion than that the drainage was common to both rivers. The alignment of the Et\u00e1wa branch of the canal has, however, entirely turned its waters towards the Rind. The Rind flows onwards into the Et\u00e1 district, and drains the depressions on each side of its course. The Rind is also known by the name of Ratwa in this district, and further south it is called Arind. Reh is common along the course of this stream, and has increased very much of late years, so that hardly a village close to the river is now free from this destructive salt.\n\nThe Sengar rises in this district near the great Adh\u00e1wan jhil, and, taking a southerly course at first, continues onward inclining to the east. It has a total length of 190 miles through this district, Et\u00e1wa, Mainpuri, and Cawnpore, and joins the Jumna near the\ntown of Musansgar in the Cawnpore district, at a point centrically situated between the two stations of Kalpi and Hamirpur. The increasing width and depth of the channel characteristic of the Duab rivers renders the Sengar a formidable stream in the lower part of its course, where it runs through deep and raviney ground on its approach to the Jumna. This line of drainage receives the rain-fall from the south of Koil, almost due south. For two or three years the Sengar, in its course through Hathras, has been used as a canal distributary, but in the hot and cold weathers this stream is dry. In the rains it has a breadth of about 42 feet and a depth of about four feet. The banks are sloping, and the bed is soft and clayey.\n\nThe Isan rises in a tract to the east of Sikandra Rao, amidst a series of jhils or extensive flats near the villages of Ikbalpur, Kheriya, and Bargawan; to the east of the Rind and between the two, the Cawnpore terminal branch of the Ganges Canal runs along the watershed southwards. These depressions, like those forming the sources of most of the Duab rivers, are so very shallow, that their irregularities in depth can only be traced by the levelling instrument. They continue onwards parallel to and almost fringing the line upon which the Cawnpore branch runs, as far as its twenty-fourth mile, where the Jinwar jhil in the Etah district is met with. The Isan is dry except during the rains, when it has a breadth of about 100 feet and a depth of about six feet. The banks are sloping, and the bed is soft and muddy.\n\nThe Karon or Karwan Nadi rises in the Bulandshahr district, and runs through the west of this district through parganahs Chandauli, Khair, Hasangarh, Gorai, and Mursan. The fields lying close to this stream are often benefited by the percolation of moisture during the rains, but, as a rule, in the hot and cold weathers it is dry. The Karon has a breadth of about 29 feet, and a depth of about five feet in the rains. The banks are generally sloping, and the bed is soft and muddy. The Chohiya rises in the Bulandshahr district, and after entering this district joins the Nim near Shaikhupur in parganah Atrauli. The breadth in the rains is about 170 feet, with a depth of eight feet. At other times it is dry.\n\nThe Nim is a considerable stream, which enters this district from parganah Dibai of the Bulandshahr district, near the village of Dhuro in parganah Atrauli. It flows slightly southwest, approaching closer and closer to the Kali, which it eventually joins to the south in the Etah district. It is seldom dry, and is used for irrigation purposes. There is a certain amount of tarai, or low-lying land liable to inundation during the rains, along the Nim towards its confluence with the Kali. The Nim is bridged at Malasi and Bhikampur. It has a breadth of 200 feet, and a depth of eight feet in the rains, with a sandy bed and sloping banks.\nThe K\u0101l\u012b or Kalindri N\u0101di flows from north-west to south-east through parganahs Atrauli, Jal\u0101li, and Akram\u0101d, and, forming East K\u0101l\u012b N\u0101di. the boundary between Gang\u0101tri and Sikandra Rao, enters the Et\u0101 district. It is not navigable in this district, but is used for irrigation, and for some years has formed an escape for the excess water from the canals. Inundation from this cause has occasionally been a source of loss to the villages lying along its banks in this district. Another evil, due to the increased volume of water in the K\u0101l\u012b, is the exudation of reh, which renders patches of land quite unculturable. The facilities afforded for irrigation would, however, appear to more than counterbalance the losses from floods and reh.\n\nThe canal escapes are situated at K\u0101simpur on the main line, and at Ginauli on the Cawnpore terminal line. There is a fair amount of tar\u1e0di or low-lying land along the banks of this river. The K\u0101l\u012b is bridged on the eleventh mile of the road from Aligarh to Moradabad, and here the width of the stream in high flood is 187 feet, and depth 14 feet; width in ordinary flood 95 feet, and depth 7\u00bd feet; and width in hot season 30 feet, and depth 3 feet. It is also bridged at mile 22 on the Aligarh and Kasganj road, and here the width of the stream in flood is 250 feet, with a depth of 14\u00bd feet; width in ordinary flood 237 feet, with a depth of 8 feet; width in hot season 60 feet, with a depth of 5\u00bd feet. The bed is generally sandy, and the banks are sloping in this district.\n\nThe Ganges Canal enters the district at the village of D\u0101npur in parganah Barauli, bordering on the village of Khera Kh\u0101s of parganah Pah\u0101su of the Bulandshahr district. The canal continues on a straight south-easterly course, whilst the East K\u0101l\u012b N\u0101di maintains its relative position with regard to the canal as far as Dabthala, opposite the 160th mile, where it takes a bend to the eastward, regaining its former position a few miles southward, opposite S\u0101lgarhi. The distance between the Karon and K\u0101l\u012b at Kh\u016brja on the 140th mile is only 11 miles, whilst at the 160th mile this has been increased to 24 miles. The slope of the country in this section is 27\u00b773 feet, or 1\u00b738 feet per mile, from north to south. The canal passes along the watershed, and on its 160th mile the surface of the country is 15\u00b762 feet above the bed of the Karon, and 25\u00b733 feet above that of the K\u0101l\u012b. In advance of the 160th mile the alignment continues direct to Sumera, at which village there is a curve on a radius of 20,000 feet, which brings the canal on the direct bearing of the head-works of the Et\u0101wa and Cawnpore terminal lines, and of the villages of N\u0101nn and R\u0101jupur, between which these head-works are situated. This point is 180\u00b78 miles from the regulator of the canal head at Mayapur, and the main line of canal terminates here. The slope from north to south of the surface of the country from the 160th to the 180th mile is 26\u00b786 feet, giving an average per mile of 1\u00b734 feet. Its transverse slope tends towards the\nwestward from the K\u00e1li to the Karon, and further south to the heads of the Sengar river. The canal alignment has been kept as near as possible to the K\u00e1li, in order to avoid the low tracts in which the Sengar collects, and in the neighbourhood of Harduanganj the canal is only 1\u00b775 miles from the K\u00e1li. The width between the Karon and K\u00e1li at the 160th mile is, as above mentioned, 24 miles, and this continues nearly to the 180th mile. Here, however, the intervention of the heads of the Sengar, which now have a well-defined section, reduces the width to ten miles, through which, about midway and along the highest ground, runs the canal. The country throughout this section is well cultivated, except near the heads of the Sengar, and the depth of the water in wells from the surface varies from 16 to 49 feet.\n\nTaking up the Cawnpore terminal line from N\u00e1n\u00fa, its total length is 169 miles 3,700 feet. It is thus described by Colonel P. Cantley:\n\n\"After leaving N\u00e1n\u00fa, and after having overcome the difficulties of the flats and hollows between that place and Sikandra Rao, the channel proceeds in an easterly direction, keeping to the line of main canal of my original survey, and maintaining an almost direct course centrally between the Isan and Rind rivers, as far as the 98th mile at the village of Dingari; south of this point the Hind river discontinues its parallelism with the Isan, and proceeds onwards on a more southerly course, whilst the P\u00e1ndu river, the heads of which lie on the left of the Rind and in the neighbourhood of Sabhad and B\u00e1ndmau (villages situated to the south-east of Dingari), takes up the bearing which the Rind has deserted and continues on a course parallel to the Isan river. At the 98th mile, therefore, the line of canal turns the heads of the P\u00e1ndu and proceeds onwards, keeping to the left of that river and between it and the Isan, until it reaches the 139th mile; at this point, and on the left, the N\u00fan, a line of drainage connected with the Ganges and the lowland lying between Cawnpore and Bith\u00far, rises; keeping this low land connected with the N\u00fan on the left, and still maintaining its parallelism with the P\u00e1ndu river, the canal proceeds onward to the village of B\u00e9ra, or to the 160th mile, from thence it takes a long sweep to the north-east, and passing between the town and military baz\u00e1rs of Cawnpore, enters the Ganges river by a series of lock and falls.\"\n\nThe total length of the Et\u00e1wa terminal branch, from the N\u00e1n\u00fa regulator to the Jumna, is 175 miles. It leaves the regulator at an angle of 21\u00b75\u00b0 corresponding with that of the departure of the Cawnpore branch. After passing the fort of Bijaiagarh, where it takes a curve bringing it directly parallel to the Cawnpore branch and the course of the Rind, it proceeds onwards in the same direction on a length of 65 miles. At this point, near the village of Gangsi, \"it makes a turn to the right, and leaving the Rind,\n\n---\n\n1 Ganges Canal, I, 250.\nit keeps clear of the heads of the Ahniya and Phura, two rivers which join the Rind in one connected channel under the village of Bhimwaman. Avoiding the drainage connected with the above two rivers, the line regains its parallel direction to the Rind, which it maintains from the 116th to the 145th mile. At this point a comparatively sharp turn to the right, near the village of Gajamau, not far from the town of Akbarpur, clears the heads of the Nim, a river that, rising near Akbarpur, takes a course almost parallel to the Rind. From thence the canal, passing to the right of the Nim, reaches the Jumna river at the village of Fatehabad, eight miles east of the town of Musanagar. From the above general description it will be understood that the Etawa terminal line, throughout its whole course, runs to the right of the Rind river, keeping as much as possible out of the influence of the tributaries and drainage which are connected with it. The Sengar river, the heads of which lie in the neighbourhood of Koil and the town of Bijaiagarh, throughout its whole course maintains a parallel direction to the canal flowing on its right, so that, in fact, the Etawa branch, from its head at the N\u00e1nu regulator to its terminus in the Jumna, passes between the Rind and the Sengar rivers on a course as equidistantly marked out as the position of the ridge or watershed would admit of.\"\n\nHaving described the course of the canal, I now turn to the works on the main line and its branches. At D\u00e1npur there is a bridge with a water-way of three bays of 40 feet each, r\u00e1jbaha and inlet heads; gh\u00e1ts and a second-class chauki are attached, and similar bridges exist at Barauli and Dabthala. Near Sumera, on the 163rd mile of the course of the canal, falls have been constructed with a drop of five feet in perpendicular height, to meet the lower level found near the heads of the Sengar and Rind on the right, and the Isan on the left. This work consists of five bays of 20 feet each, giving a clear water-way of 100 feet, with a navigable channel, locks, mills, r\u00e1jbaha heads, &c. Three miles below Simra, near the village of Kasimpur, an escape leads into the K\u00e1li, with a water-way of 60 feet divided into ten sluices of six feet each, attached to the up-stream side of the bridge, with its head well protected by masonry revetments constructed in the step form. The distance from the K\u00e1li is 20,577 feet, and the total fall between the escape flooring and the bed of the river is 21-35 feet. The other works between Kasimpur and N\u00e1nu are the bridges at Barautha, Mach\u00faa, Changeri, and Shaikha, each with a water-way of three bays of 40 feet each, r\u00e1jbaha and inlet heads, gh\u00e1ts and a second-class chauki. From B\u00farki to the 50th mile, where the Fategarh or Am\u00fapshahr branch is given off, the height of the top of the bank from the canal bed has a minimum of 15 feet, and that of the berm or towing path from the canal bed is 12 feet. The latter is a constant quantity, and although it is exceeded in many places where the depth of excavation is great, the depth of 12 feet for the trapezoidal portion which is\nintended for the retention of the canal water is always maintained. The height and width of embankments vary with the amount of earth excavated from the channel, but the earth is always spread out so as to form an even esplanade.\n\nSouthwards from the Anupshahr branch head the width of the canal falls from 140 feet to 130 feet, and the depth from the top of the bank from 15 feet to 14 feet, and from the berm to the bed of the canal from 12 feet to 11 feet. These are continued as the minimum measurements as far as Khatauli or the 62nd mile, and from this point to the 105th mile the width is reduced to 120 feet; from the 105th to the 144th mile it is 110 feet, and the berm is reduced from 11 feet to 10 feet from the bed of the canal, leaving an average depth of 8 feet of water in the canal. From the 144th mile to Nanu the width is gradually reduced to 80 feet by decrements averaging 10 inches per mile. The depth of trapezoidal channel, or from the surface of the towing path to the canal bed, is maintained at ten feet, to allow of a clear two feet above the high-water level in the canal. The width of the water-way of the bridges from the 110th to the 180th mile has been maintained on two uniform dimensions, viz., of 135 and 120 feet, the former having three bays of 45 feet each, and the latter three bays of 40 feet each. Every bridge, except Damkaura and Acheja, from the Bplandsbahr head downwards, has two rajbahas heads attached to it, one on each side of the canal, with channels ten feet in width. The sill or flooring of the rajbahas is laid two feet above the bed of the canal and of the flooring of the bridge to which it is attached.\n\nThe following diagram gives a section and plan of the general arrangement of the canal, and shows the lining out of the road at a point where it comes in contact with a milestone. These stones are numbered from the Mayapur regulating bridge in a continued series to Nanu. They are situated away from the road on a platform kept clear for their especial purpose. \"They consist of a square prism of stone imbedded in a cylindrical mass of masonry, the top of which acts as a benchmark, and the figures engraved on the stone, independently of the mileage, give the exact depression of that particular point from the flooring of the regulating bridge at Mayapur. On the following diagram the width of the bank is supposed to be much greater than that laid down as a minimum dimension; in fact, as it really is on the greater part of this section of the canal, the road is here 20 feet wide, with an additional 10 feet between it and the plantations, so as to prevent the passage being interrupted by boughs of trees. The road by these means actually maintains a width of 30 feet; it has a slight slope internally, so that all drainage may flow away from instead of towards the canal channel, and there is a low edging of earth carried along the crest of the interior slope,\n\n1 From Cautley's Ganges Canal, I, 244.\nfor the purpose of preventing the action of the water from destroying its uniformity.\"\n\nAt the Sumera falls near Jaw\u00e1, a small portion of the water-power in the navigation channel is utilised for driving mills; one containing six pairs of stones has been erected there, and each pair turns out about one maund (82lb.) of flour per hour.\n\nThe position of the drainage areas of the Sengar and Rind influenced in a great measure the direction of the line of main canal from the 152nd mile, in the neighbourhood of Somna, downwards, and the intervention of the Isan determined the site for the bifurcation of the Et\u00e1wa and Cawnpore terminal lines, so as to reach the high land stretching between the Isan and the Rind along which the Cawnpore line is taken. The slope of 15 inches has been continued along both lines as far as the natural profile of the country would admit of it, and when this ceases to be the case, the slopes are reduced to 12 inches per mile, the superfluous fall being overcome by masonry descents and lockage. The regulating bridges at N\u00e1n\u00fa have each a water-way of 100 feet divided into five bays of 20 feet each, and are connected with each other by a line of curved revetment, resting upon a redan-shaped platform, which projects its acute angle towards the point of\nbifurcation. The main line as it approaches this point bears on a line which bisects the angle of departure of the two branches. This angle is equal to $43^\\circ$ and the main line meets it on an angle of $158^\\circ$. The object of this lining out of the works is, that ordinarily each branch may have an equal supply, which can be increased or decreased by the regulators over each branch as occasion may require, and, if necessary, either branch can be left entirely dry without interfering with the other, the excess water being passed off by the K\u00e1simpur and Munda Khera escapes. The staple material for building throughout this and the Bulandshahr district has been block kunkur, the use of bricks being confined to arches and to those works where block kunkur was not procurable.\n\nWith the exception of a slight curve, which gives the Cawnpore branch of the canal a direction to the south of the town of Sikandra Rao, the bearing for thirty miles is almost due south-east; at points near the fourth, sixth and ninth miles, and before its arrival at Sikandra Rao, the line of canal crosses low country which is connected with the heads of the Rind (see \"Rivers\" ante). Here there are three bridges, at Kailanpur, Rud\u00e1in and G\u00ednauli, each of which is provided with masonry inlets. These inlets have been constructed more with a view of preventing the accumulation of water by the interference of the bridge approaches with the drainage of the country than to relieve the drainage itself. To obviate the difficulties attendant upon these obstructions to the natural drainage, an escape cut was made from the G\u00ednauli bridge to the K\u00e1li, and cross cuts were made connecting the escape with the hollows in the fourth, sixth and ninth miles above mentioned. The distance of the canal from the K\u00e1li is eleven miles, and the difference in level between the sill of the escape and the bed of the K\u00e1li is $28\\cdot67$ feet, or $2\\cdot42$ feet per mile. The breadth of the cut is ten feet, and it is further connected with an escape head from the canal channel itself, which may be used should necessity arise for relieving the canal of its surplus waters. From G\u00ednauli the canal passes onwards on the same bearing into the \u00c9ta district.\u00b9 The only other works besides those already mentioned that exist along this branch in this district are the bridges at Baramai, Purdilnagar, Jarauli and Jansoi, with r\u00e1jbaha and inlet heads.\n\nThe \u00c9tawa terminal branch passes to the west of the head-waters of the Rind river, and \"proceeds onwards, touching the heads of some drainage connected with the Sengar, in the neighbourhood of the fort of Bijaigarh; the contact is very slight, occurring at the fourth mile near Bajrangpur, and at the $5\\frac{1}{2}$ mile near the village of Dupur; the country is exceedingly flat throughout, so much so, that on the right of the canal as it passes by the fort of Bijaigarh, which lies at a distance of half a mile, the eye wanders over sheets of waste and uncultivated plain, the whole of which throws its drainage into the Sengar river. As far as the fort of Bijaigarh, the line of canal is carried on a bearing almost\n\n\u00b9 Its description will be carried on under the notice of the \u00c9ta district in Gazetteer, III.\ndue south; from thence, however, it takes a turn to the left, proceeding onwards in a south-easterly direction, running parallel to the Rind as well as to the Cawnpore terminal line; at the tenth mile the canal comes in contact with a hollow in the neighbourhood of the village of J\u00e1o, over which it passes under the inconvenience of heavy embankments, but with little interference with drainage; at the twelfth mile, another hollow, but small as compared with that at J\u00e1o, is crossed under similar circumstances; the canal, in fact, at the above two points, is fringing a line of drainage that passes into the Sengar under the town of Jalesar. On its onward course, and between the 17th and 23rd miles, or between the villages of Janera and Rudarpur the canal crosses the heads of a third line of hollows, which is also connected with the Jalesar N\u00e1la.\" Bridges are built at Chitrauli, Bajrangpur, Bijaigarh, J\u00e1o, Lodipur, Katai, and Sitapur with three arches each, an eighteen feet roadway, r\u00e1jbahas, inlet heads, gh\u00e1ts, and a second-class chauki attached.\n\nThere has been some little extension of canal distributaries of late years. Feeders from Bulandshahr now enter Khair, and give water where it was much needed. The Koil r\u00e1jbaha, too, when in full work, will irrigate all the country between the railway and the Karon; and the Sikandra Rao distributary will supply water to the tract between the Cawnpore branch canal and the Isan river.\n\nThough not yet completed, the Lower Ganges Canal is so far advanced that a short account of what it is intended to perform, and the present state of the works, must be given here. It is designed to be taken from the right bank of the Ganges at Narora, on the border of the Aligarh district, about four miles below the R\u00e1jgh\u00e1t station of the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway. It will thence cross the K\u00e1li, and running down the D\u00fa\u00e1b between the Isan and the K\u00e1li, will cross the former river and the Cawnpore branch of the Ganges Canal. It will then turn the head of the P\u00e1ndu N\u00e1di, and keep between that river and the Rind to a little below Cawnpore, and afterwards follow a course south of the railway to Allahabad.\n\nThe committee appointed in 1866 to examine into the various projects for strengthening the irrigating power of the Ganges Canal, and the means to be adopted for providing water for the tract lying between the canal and the Ganges, recommended R\u00e1jgh\u00e1t in the Bulandshahr district as the point from which water should be drawn, either for a separate canal, or to supplement the Ganges Canal. It was proposed to construct a weir, 4,500 feet in length, to raise the low-water level eight feet, of which 5\u00bd feet should be raised by a masonry weir, and 2\u00bd feet by a movable board, thus raising the flood level estimated at 300,000 cubic feet per second about 1\u00bd feet, and giving a velocity of 12 feet per second over the weir in high floods. The project provided for wells and the use of block kunkur in the works, and for a channel capable of carrying 5,000 cubic feet per second. The discharge\nat R\u00e1jgh\u00e1t on the 10th April, 1866, was only 5,680 cubic feet per second, and at Cawnpore, on the 5th of April, it was 5,438 cubic feet per second, so that with the Ganges Canal at Hardw\u00e1r drawing its full supply, it was thought that this canal could not always be relied upon to receive more than about 3,000 cubic feet per second. The cost was estimated at 192 lakhs of rupees, and the return at eight per cent. on the outlay, or, with a reduced volume of water, at five per cent.\n\nIn November, 1869, the Government of India forwarded a proposal by Colonel Revival of the scheme. Strachey, C.S.I., to the Government of the North-Western Provinces for the construction of this canal. The inquiry into the merits of the work was entrusted to Mr. R. Forrest, who submitted to Government, in 1870, four alternative projects for lines to be constructed from alternative heads. His work was never completed, but to him is due the credit of having selected from amongst many alternatives the best position for the weir and head of the canals, of effecting a large saving of expense by projecting a passage across the khaddir of the Ganges, and of designing an arrangement of the various lines, which has been substantially adhered to in the ultimate project. The design was completed by Major Jeffreys, R.E., and Colonel Brownlow, R.E., arranged for the distribution of the water from a discharge fixed at 3,500 cubic feet in the cold weather and 6,500 cubic feet in the rains,\u2014the same quantities that are allotted to the Ganges Canal.\u00b9 The water will be raised to fill the canal by a weir 6\u00bd feet above the cold-weather level of the river, which is also the level of the sill of the canal entrance. Shutters will be used on the weir to increase the depth of water to ten feet when required. The main canal commences with a bottom width of 216 feet, a slope of six inches per mile, and a full supply depth of ten feet. A branch, intended as a distributary, will be thrown off at the 26th mile, to water the K\u00e1li-Ganges Du\u00e1b in the Fatehgarh District; and at mile 39, a supply channel will be thrown off to feed the Cawnpore and Et\u00e1wa branches of the Ganges Canal, which are intersected by the new canal on the 39th and 37th miles respectively of their course below N\u00e1nu. Henceforth the demands on the stream entering the Ganges Canal at Hardw\u00e1r will cease at these points, and the upper canal will be relieved of irrigation from 128 miles from Cawnpore on the Cawnpore branch and on 130 miles of the Et\u00e1wa branch. The Lower Ganges Canal will then pass on through the Et\u00e1 and Mainpuri districts, and will cross the valleys of the Isan and K\u00e1li rivers by aqueducts at miles 34 and 112, and the Cawnpore branch of the Ganges Canal at mile 115 in its own mile 94. Then heading the Pandu Nadi, the line will pass through a corner of the Et\u00e1wa district, and will intersect the Cawnpore district, running on a narrow watershed between the P\u00e1ndu and the Rind to the Fatehpur district, which it will traverse in close proximity to the railway. Through this\n\n\u00b9 Project of the Lower Ganges Canal : Allahabad, 1874.\nportion of its course it interferes little with the natural drainage of the country, and on approaching the Sasur Khaderi Nala, skirts the right bank to the Jumna, to which the surplus waters will find their way by a dry ravine. From the Etawa branch will be taken the Bhognipur line, to water the tract between the Sengar and the Jumna, and lower down the Gh\u00e2tampur r\u00e2jbaha, and to supply these two important channels with water it is intended to lead a second feeder, to be called the Jhinjhak branch, into the Etawa branch. A still-water channel will go on to Allahabad itself, and the main line will be navigable to this point. The supply branch to the Cawnpore and Etawa branches will be made-navigable, while the Cawnpore branch is already navigable, and the Etawa branch will be made so. A still-water channel will connect the town of Fatehgarh main with the main line, and the tail of the Cawnpore branch will be linked on to the line by a channel crossing the P\u00e2ndu river. The details of the works in each district are given in the district notices, and need not be further noticed here.\n\nThe scheme embraces in all 555 miles of new main canals and 942 miles of distributaries. The cost of these is estimated at Rs. 1,82,58,451, and if we add to this the original cost of the Cawnpore and Etawa branch channels, which this project now absorbs, the capital account will stand at Rs. 2,22,65,232. The gross income is taken at Rs. 25,80,000, and the net income at Rs. 19,50,000, which would give a direct profit of 8-8 per cent. From these estimates and the actual cost of the Upper Ganges Canal, it would appear that the ultimate cost of the whole of this great system of works for the Du\u00e1b will not exceed five millions sterling. The only great work in the upper portion of the Lower Ganges Canal is the weir and head-works at Narora. These were estimated to cost Rs. 19,61,828, besides Rs. 2,40,600 for temporary accommodation, such as workshops, bungalows, &c.\n\nThree divisions (Narora, Kasganj, and Bhongaon), comprising 107 miles of main canal and 24 miles of supply channel, were started during 1873-74. The workshops form a separate charge. The outlay during the year on works, including the workshops, was Rs. 14,92,735; tools and plant, Rs. 105,979; manufacture of materials, Rs. 6,27,250; and establishment, Rs. 2,10,687; or a total of Rs. 24,36,651. The work taken in hand on the weir comprised the under-sunk foundations for the left wing wall, those of 800 feet run of the weir proper adjoining it, and those of the weir sluices. The left wing wall will stand on twenty-seven circular wells, 12 feet in diameter, and all these were sunk to within five feet of their proper depth in 1873-74. The weir proper contains in its foundations a line of blocks ten feet square and sunk to 18 feet, and a line of wells eight feet in diameter; nearly all of these were sunk before the rains of 1874, and concretion was commenced. The foundations of the weir sluices contain 152 blocks under the superstructure, 80 blocks under the partitioning floor, 32 wells 12 feet in diameter,\nand 54 wells eight feet in diameter; of these all were in hand except 31 of the first set of blocks, and eight of the second. The sinking of the blocks varies from 12 to 20 feet, and that of the wells is about 33 feet. A branch railway connected with the Oudh and Rohilkhand line has been made for the carriage of block kunkur and other materials. Brick and mortar are brought from the brick-fields near Narora, where six steam mortar mills are at work near the lime-kilns adjoining the weir. The foundations sunk to the close of the year aggregated 1,227 feet in length, and, in addition, the right and left revetment foundations were completed. In a few years the entire works will be finished, and the great scheme of irrigation for the whole Du\u00e1b, from the Siw\u00e1l\u00edks to Allahabad, after forty years of thought and work, will be brought to a conclusion. Twenty years hence it will be time to review the effect of these recent extensions upon the prosperity of the Lower Du\u00e1b. As I have already shown, canals have not been an unmixed benefit to the people; but it is promised that the experience gained by the department shall not be lost sight of, and that the \"error committed in the Upper Du\u00e1b of diverting drainage from its natural course into other natural channels which were not created for its reception, without duly enlarging their capacity, shall be avoided.\"\n\nThere are now no public ferries in this district. By Regulation VI. of Ferries.\n\n1819, seven ferries and fourteen dependent gh\u00e1ts were made public ferries, and yielded in 1820 a net revenue of Rs. 7,673; in 1821, Rs. 6,658; and in 1822, Rs. 7,260. In 1823 the ferries were leased to Mr. James Gardner of K\u00e1sganj for Rs. 22,000. In 1832 the ferries were again placed under the Magistrate; and in 1837, the last remaining ferry, that of Jasupur on the Ganges, was transferred to the Budaon Magistrate, who still controls the Ganges ferries, while those on the Jumna are under the Deputy Commissioner of Gurgaon.\n\nThe general surface of the country is, as a rule, dry, and the few jhils or natural reservoirs of water are confined to the depressions in the higher level of the country through which the Ganges Canal and its branches pass. Some of these have been drained by the canal authorities, and measures are being taken to drain the rest. Occasionally in the rains strips of land, several miles in extent, are slightly flooded in parganah Akrabad, and the Adh\u00e1wan jhil, near the sources of the Sengar, is of considerable size in the rains. There are also fair sized jhils at Gopi, Bhawan Garhi, Shaikha, Ikri and Gursikaran in Koil. The Shaikha jhil on the borders of parganah Husain and that near Husain itself are of fair size. The Sikandra Rao parganah contains a large number of jhils, and the one near the town of that name is said to affect particularly the health of the inhabitants. To the north of the district, the Aligarh and Barauli parganahs contain a fair number of jhils, but there are none in the other parganahs of the district that deserve the name.\nThe railway stations on the East Indian Railway within this district are Somna, 14 miles north-west of Aligarh; the Aligarh civil station, which forms the junction with the Oudh and Rohilkhand line to Moradabad; P\u00e1li, seven miles south-east, and H\u00e1thras road, 19 miles south-east. The stations of the Oudh and Rohilkhand line are Aligarh, R\u00e1mpur for Harduaganj, and Raipur for Atrauli. The statistics of the traffic of the district by rail show a maximum from October to April, and thence a gradual falling off, until the minimum is reached during the rains.\n\nThe returns of the East Indian Railway for 1871 were\u2014\n\n| H\u00c1THRAS. | P\u00c1LI. | ALIGARH. | SOMNA. |\n|----------|-------|----------|--------|\n| Goods.   |       | Goods.   |        |\n| Inwards. | Outwards. | Passengers. | Inwards. | Outwards. | Passengers. | Inwards. | Outwards. | Passengers. | Inwards. | Outwards. | Passengers. |\n| 315,988  | 306,415 | 37,820   | 3,718   | 6,820   | 1,615     | 173,386   | 143,652   | 84,221   | 194      | 1,474     | 5,283     |\n\nThe following table shows the detail of traffic on the Rohilkhand line:\n\n| ATRAULI ROAD. | ALIGARH. |\n|---------------|----------|\n| Goods.        | Passengers and Parcels, &c. |\n| Inwards.      | Outwards. | Number of passengers. | Earnings. | Inwards. | Outwards. | Number of passengers. | Earnings. | Inwards. | Outwards. | Number of passengers. | Earnings. | Total earnings. | Cost of establishment. |\n| Period.       |           | Inwards. | Outwards. | Number of passengers. | Earnings. | Inwards. | Outwards. | Number of passengers. | Earnings. | Inwards. | Outwards. | Number of passengers. | Earnings. | Total earnings. | Cost of establishment. |\n| 1st half of 1872 | 4 3 | 4 17 | 4,084 | 65 | 9 | 4,363 | 70 | 6 | 170 | 9 | 1,948 | 17 | 18,151 | 410 | 18 | 17,557 | 516 | 4 | 5,150 | 7 | 81 | 2 |\n| 2nd ditto ... | 8 0 | 4 17 | 5,486 | 98 | 16 | 5,956 | 108 | 8 | 953 | 6 | 448 | 6 | 2,555 | 1,155 | 19 | 34,949 | 1,007 | 4 | 5,157 | 12 | 88 | 0 |\n| 1st ditto 1873 | 30 | 15 | 5 | 5 | 6,848 | 156 | 13 | 6,922 | 165 | 11 | 5,951 | 6 | 2,607 | 18 | 38,596 | 2,195 | 11 | 38,392 | 2,581 | 9 | 11,356 | 7 | 286 | 5 |\n| 2nd ditto ... | 34 | 17 | 132 | 6 | 6,953 | 153 | 9 | 7,417 | 179 | 12 | 3,794 | 10 | 4,361 | 5 | 13,013 | 3,063 | 15 | 38,108 | 2,549 | 9 | 14,343 | 6 | 31 | 15 |\n| 1st ditto 1874 | 29 | 11 | 1,064 | 16 | 7,690 | 189 | 9 | 8,321 | 231 | 7 | 6,982 | 15 | 5,945 | 7 | 44,097 | 3,395 | 4 | 45,614 | 3,397 | 4 | 27,540 | 13 | 44 | 10 |\nThe H\u00e1thras road station of the East Indian Railway is about six miles from H\u00e1thras town, and the Atrauli road station of the Rohilkhand line is about the same distance from Atrauli. A new line of light railway on the narrow gauge system, now in process of construction between H\u00e1thras and Muttra, is intended to accommodate the H\u00e1thras traffic towards the west, and the pilgrim traffic to and from Muttra. It will run nearly parallel to the metalled road from H\u00e1thras to Muttra, on a nearly level line, and will cost a comparatively small sum when compared with other lines: about 15 miles of this line lie within the Aligarh district. To avoid the great expense and delay experienced in the transhipment of goods from broad gauge wagons to narrow gauge wagons, two lines of rail, constituting a narrow and broad gauge, will run between H\u00e1thras city and the East Indian Railway station. The Ganges Canal also constitutes a means of communication, chiefly for through traffic, and for timber and bamboos as far as Baranatha and N\u00e1n\u00fa.\n\nThe principal metalled and bridged first class roads in the district are the\u2014(1) Grand Trunk Road, which enters the district at the 276th mile from Allahabad, at the south-east corner, and proceeds by Sikandra Rao, Koil and Somna to the Bulandshahr district, where one branch leads to Dehli and another, via Bulandshahr, to Meerut. The total length of this road in this district is 49 miles 5-3 furlongs. It crosses the Ganges Canal at N\u00e1n\u00fa and the East Indian Railway near Ch\u00fahanpur; (2) Koil to Moradabad by Atrauli and Ramgh\u00e1t, 24\u00bd miles in this district, passes by the important marts of Harduanganj and Atrauli, and crosses the K\u00e1li by a handsome bridge, built in 1851 on the eleventh mile; (3) Koil to An\u00fapshahr by Jaw\u00e1, 12\u00bd miles, crosses the canal by a bridge; (4) Koil to Tappal 31 miles 7-5 furlongs, of which 20 miles are metalled and the remainder is raised and bridged; (4) H\u00e1thras to K\u00e1sganj by Sikandra Rao and the railway station, nearly 30 miles from the town and 23 miles 7-7 furlongs from the railway station; (5) Koil to Agra through S\u00e1sni and H\u00e1thras, 29 miles 5 furlongs; (6) Koil to Muttra through Igl\u00e1s, 24\u00bd8 miles; (7) Aligarh to K\u00e1sganj by Panehti, has a total length of 20-08 miles in this district, of which 9\u00bd miles are metalled, and it is intended to macadamize the whole road in connection with the Eta authorities. At present the road is raised and bridged, and, when metalled, will complete all the principal lines of communication in this district: this road crosses the K\u00e1li by a bridge in the 22nd mile from Aligarh; (8) H\u00e1thras by Murs\u00e1n to Muttra, 15\u00bd miles. Besides these metalled roads, a network of cross country roads connect each great branch with the other, and with all the principal marts, towns, police-stations and bridges on the canals. There are good bridges over the Nim at Mals\u00e1i, built in 1841 at Bhikampur, built by subscription in 1856; and over the K\u00e1li at Haidaramai, built by Government in 1830; and over the same river at D\u00e1ul\u00ed.\n\n---\n\n1 See page 30.\nThe following table gives a list of the second-class roads which, though unmetalled, are raised and bridged, and the third-class roads which are not raised with the distances of each within this district:\n\n### Second class roads\n\n| Route                        | M.

The western tahsils of Igl\u00e1s and Khair have a smaller rain-fall than the remainder of the district, and the winter crops in Khair and Atrauli are dependent upon the winter rains. On the whole, the rain-fall is adequate, and there is so much irrigation that even in seasons of drought there can now be little distress in this district.\n\nPART II.\n\nPRODUCTIONS OF THE DISTRICT.\n\nThere are no species of animals, either wild or domesticated, peculiar to this district as distinguished from the other districts of the Meerut division. Cows sell at from ten to thirty rupees each, and plough cattle can be obtained at from ten to fifty rupees each. Ponies fetch from ten rupees upwards, but a serviceable country-bred horse costs two hundred rupees. Riding camels are not bred in the district, but camels for burden can be bought for about Rs. 75. Sheep sell at from half a rupee to one rupee each, and when prepared for sale to Europeans, they fetch two rupees each. Government stallions from the stud stand at Bhilpur Mit\u00e1i, Daryapur, Somna and Kauriyaganj, and a few stud bulls are distributed throughout the district with good results. The black buck or antelope is very common, and there are a few nilgai (Portax pictus). Game birds are generally scarce, but peacock and, in the cold-weather, all kinds of wild duck and geese are plentiful. Rewards are given for the destruction of wolves: one rupee for every full-grown male, two rupees for full-grown females, and eight annas for cubs. The following table shows the deaths recorded as due to the attacks of wild beasts and snake-bites for the years 1869 to 1873:\n\n|        | 1869 | 1871 | 1872 | 1873 | Total of four years | Average of four years |\n|--------|------|------|------|------|---------------------|-----------------------|\n| Males  | 27   | 16   | 47   | 26   | 118                 | 29                    |\n| Females| 21   | 18   | 33   | 32   | 104                 | 26                    |\n| Total  | 48   | 34   | 80   | 60   | 222                 | 55                    |\nFish is not a common article of consumption. The kinds usually sold are for the most part scaleless and are caught in tanks. The more common are the *saur*, *potra*, *jhinga*, *singi*, *lachi*, *rohi*, *karol*, *rotiya*, *chilka*, *dor*, *seteliya*, *bhir*, and *mughara*. There are no regular fisheries in this district, and no colonies of persons living by river industries. The census returns show only forty men who have no other trade than fishing.\n\nThe mode of husbandry in this district differs so little in any important respect from that practised in the other districts of the division, that it would be useless repetition to describe it here. The facts relating to the practice of agriculture given under the Meerut district will hold equally good for Aligarh. I will therefore confine myself to a general view of the present state of the district, its cultivation, amount and value of produce, irrigation, and the few peculiar agricultural products worthy of notice. The great extent to which, at last settlement, cultivation had already been carried, left comparatively little room for the increase which steadily advancing prices and the introduction of canal irrigation would have led us to expect.\n\nCultivated and culturable area.\n\nStill the change, such as it is, has everywhere been on the side of increase. The total cultivated area, which at the last settlement amounted to 839,127 acres, has now increased to 897,172 acres, or by seven per cent. The settlement statistics of cultivation for Atrauli and Igl\u00e1s respectively represent the maximum and minimum of increase. From the same records it appears that the proportion of the cultivated area to the culturable area has risen from 82 per cent. at the past settlement to 88 per cent., so that now only 12 per cent. of the culturable area, or 121,168 acres, remains unfilled, and of this 5,676 acres are under groves. The greater portion of this culturable waste consists of wide tracts of poor sand or alluvial *khadir* lying in tahsilis Atrauli and Khair (75,769 acres, or 62\u00bd per cent.), and there cultivation reaches only 81 per cent. of the culturable area, whilst in the remainder of the district it covers 92 per cent., and the culturable waste comprises only small patches devoted to grazing purposes. The area under grass for pasturage is very restricted, so much so, that in several parganahs, as Murs\u00e1n, where cultivation is 96 per cent., and H\u00e1thras, where it is 95 per cent. of the culturable area, the *kharif*, which is specially useful for growing crops for fodder, has had to be increased at the expense of superior produce in the *rabi*. As a general rule, the more extensive the *rabi* the richer and more productive the crop, and here only in exceptional cases does the *kharif* in any way exceed the *rabi*. The few wide uncultivated pasture lands in Atrauli and Khair must sooner or later come under the plough, and in a very short time cultivation must reach its maximum in this district. The pressure of the population on the land is even now severely felt; and when extension of cultivation can no longer be resorted to, emigration must be attempted; and it would be wise\nto commence this in time, so as to gain the experience which will ultimately be found necessary.\n\nGreat fertility is the characteristic of the district, and in the cold-weather it presents an almost unbroken sea of green, with the village sites appearing at intervals. Though only a portion of the total area is sown with rabi crops, a considerable portion of the kharif is also resown, so that the intervals of unoccupied ground are scarcely seen. Mr. Smith thinks that, of all the parganahs, Hathras has best retained its old pre-eminence of being the most fertile. As early as the beginning of the present century, the Commissioners who visited Hathras compared its appearance favourably with that of other portions of the district, and now, though there is more equality in the various sub-divisions of the district, Hathras is still supreme. \"Next to Hathras in natural advantages comes Igl\u00e1s, then Sikandra Rao and Koil, and then the two tahsils of Khair and Atrauli. There are tracts, indeed, in these two last tahsils which equal or surpass anything in other parts of the district, but on the whole the sub-divisions stand pretty much in the order named so far as soil and natural capability of irrigation are concerned.\" B\u00e9ra and manjha lands are always manured, but manjha to a less extent than b\u00e9ra. The cost of manuring is not great, and the benefit is enormous. These lands yield both the rain and cold-weather crops, and sometimes an intermediate crop. Nearly all the other lands yield but one crop in the year, the kharif or rabi crop being taken according to circumstances.\n\nThe principal crops are wheat, barley, jodr, bdjra, gram, cotton and indigo.\n\nPrincipal crops. Within the last twenty years the quality of both cotton and indigo has improved, whilst that of the other kinds of agricultural produce has remained much as it was. The statement given below shows the acreage of the various crops on the ground during the year in which each sub-division of the district was surveyed at the recent settlement. The estimate of average produce is formed \"chiefly on the results of constant and unremitting inquiry from cultivators and landholders in every portion of the district for every quality of soil, and as the knowledge of the cultivator or landowner is based on the experience of many lives available over the whole area of the district, and is itself, in fact, the outcome of innumerable and trustworthy trials,\" Mr. Smith has depended almost wholly on this source of information, having found the actual cutting and weighing of specified areas, in practice, both not to be relied upon and misleading. The estimate of chaff or jh\u00e1sa is very difficult to frame correctly. By far the larger portion is privately consumed by the cultivators for their own cattle, and but very little is sold. Some kinds of chaff, such as that of gram, mung, urd, masur, and peas are especially prized, and fetch a high price. The price is the harvest price, or that actually received by the cultivator, and is necessarily much below the price ruling in the market at the time. These prices were obtained from the patw\u00e1ris or\nvillage accountants of the various sub-divisions. I give Mr. Smith's statement here. The value of cotton includes that of seed, of moth, arhar, &c., and the cereals includes the value of the chaff:\n\n**Statement showing the area under each crop, the produce and value.**\n\n| Name of

cultivated area, 433,516 acres, or 48\u00b73 per cent., are under kharif or rain crops, and 450,946 acres, or 50\u00b73 per cent., are under rabi or cold-weather crops, whilst 12,710 acres are fallow (b\u0101han), ploughed and ready for sowing. The area under wheat, cotton and j\u014dar is 460,866 acres, or 51 per cent. of the whole cultivated area, of which wheat occupies 20, and j\u014dar 17 per cent.; next come barley and bejar, the latter a mixture of gram and barley, or peas and barley, which occupy 185,426 acres, or 20 per cent. of the cultivated area. B\u0101jra and gram cover 126,679 acres, or 14 per cent. of the cultivated area; the pulses moth, mung, and urd and goj\u0101i, a mixture of wheat and barley, occupy 54,482 acres; and indigo appears on 29,013 acres. The valuable crops of tobacco and vegetables only show 4,894 acres, and Mr. W. H. Smith considers this to be the chief defect of the returns. A much larger area is cultivated under these crops\u2014such as maize, tobacco, vegetables, chaina, onions, fenugreek, spices, &c.\u2014than is shown above. These crops are chiefly \u2018dofasli,\u2019 that is, one of a double crop in the same year, and only the crop on the ground was recorded. In the case of indigo, only that which was sown as one crop for the year of measurement was recorded, whilst it is notorious that always in b\u0101ra and manjha lands, and often in bark\u0101 lands, indigo ground is re-sown with cold-weather crops. It is estimated that at least ten per cent. of the cultivated area is dofasli, or bears two crops in the year. The estimate is also defective under the miscellaneous crops. Where sarson is sown with wheat, d\u0101a with barley, arhar with cotton, mung and urd with j\u014dar, and moth with b\u0101jra, the chief crop only is stated. The estimate of their value is about two per cent. of the total value of all produce. For these reasons the total value of the produce given above must be increased from Rs. 2,06,40,749 to Rs. 2,31,17,637, or Rs. 25-12-3 per statute acre. The Government demand according to this estimate would amount to 9\u00b74 per cent. only of the value of the total produce during a fair average year.\n\nIt will be seen from the table above given that there is no poppy and very little sugar-cane cultivation, and that, besides grain, the staple crops are indigo and cotton. Grain naturally takes up by far the greater part of the cultivated area,\u2014in fact wheat, barley, j\u014dar, b\u0101jra, gram, bejar and goj\u0101i occupy 73\u00b72 per cent. of the cultivated area; and if b\u0101han, or land ploughed and prepared for sowing, be excluded, then these grain crops comprise 74\u00b73 per cent. of the entire cultivation. Similarly, cotton occupies 119,715 acres, or 13\u00b76 per cent. of the actual cultivation, and the indigo cultivation covers 29,013 acres, or 3\u00b74 per cent.; so that the principal grains, indigo and cotton taken together, form 91\u00b73 per cent. of the total produce. The area under both cotton and indigo has\nincreased very much of late years, but there has been no such great or sudden displacement of the area under food-grains to make way for cotton and indigo as to afford any reasonable ground for alarm. In fact, the increase in cultivation more than counterbalances the increase in the area devoted to other than food grains.\n\nIndigo being a crop of special importance to the district, some account of its cultivation and the manufacture of the dye appears to be necessary here. The peculiarity in the cultivation of indigo in this district is that the plant occupies the ground only for six months (April to September), and there is not a khunti or second crop as in the Benares Division. The monsoon breaks so very late in the Upper D\u00fa\u00e1b that recourse must be had to irrigation either from wells or the canal before sowing the seed. Towards the end of the spring, as soon as the approaching hot-weather tempers the coldness of the nights, the seed is sown. If the seed were sown earlier, there would be danger of its germination being checked, or perhaps killed altogether, by the excessive cold. It is therefore not considered advisable to sow earlier than the end of March or beginning of April. The seed is sown broad-cast and roughly harrowed in by the henga, or even a bundle of branches of trees, and in five or six days the young plants spring above the ground. Weeding operations commence within about a month from the appearance of the plant above ground, and have to be repeated at least twice, and sometimes oftener. In August the plant has generally attained to its full growth, and the cutting commences. When cut it is tied into bundles and taken on carts to the place of manufacture, where it is weighed in presence of the cultivator. The manager of the factory loses no time in having the plant packed into the vats, and the pressure requisite for fermentation being effected by means of several strong beams tightly fastened down between posts fixed into the opposite walls of the vats, and water being applied, the process of steeping commences.\n\nThe first process, or the steeping of the plant, continues from eleven to fifteen hours, according to the temperature prevailing at the time. Thus one day and one night have been occupied in cutting, leading and steeping the plant. The second process consists in beating the fermented water and separating the fecula. The plant having been sufficiently steeped, the water therefrom is drawn into a lower vat, and by the aid of coolies (who beat the water with sticks) the separation of the particles of colour is brought about. This process in fine weather occupies two to three hours. The third process is boiling the fecula. In the course of this process, during the second day, the water is drawn off from the\n\n---\n\n1 Agra Exhibition Catalogue, 1867.\nlower vat, leaving the dye deposited at the bottom, from which it is conducted in a drain to the boiler. Here no time should be lost in lighting the boiler furnace, care being taken that the colour be well stirred in the boiler until the boiling is considered sufficient. These operations generally occupy five to six hours from the time of lighting the fire. The fourth process consists in cooling and collecting the dye.\n\nBelow the boiler (and roofed over) is a large shallow vat, in which (a few inches from the bottom) rests a framework of bambu, over which is stretched a stout sheet. When the boiling has been concluded, the contents of the boiler are drawn off into this cooling vat, the water being drained off under the bambus, and the now thickened dye remaining on the sheet. The fifth process consists in filling the frame with the dye, and pressing the same by means of screws. As soon as it has become quite cool, the sheet is unfastened at the far end and sides, and the whole of the colour drawn together to facilitate its removal. This is then taken in buckets and put into perforated boxes or frames, inside of which strong cloth has been previously placed to prevent any of the dye escaping from the holes by which the water trickles out when pressure is applied.\n\nThe sixth process is pressing the dye. The mass of colour now filled into the frames (12 inches) in a liquid state is compressed down to about 3\u00bd inches by means of screws. After remaining pressed down for some hours, until all the water has escaped, the screws are all unloosed, and the dye, now comparatively firm, and forming a slab of 3\u00bd inches in thickness is cut into cakes of 3\u00bd inches square. The cakes having been thus cut are placed upon an open bambu framework, fitted in stages, in a house from which the wind is carefully excluded. This precaution is rendered necessary from the tendency which indigo has to crack and fall to pieces if allowed to dry rapidly. Indigo when presenting a sound and uncracked appearance in the chests, when exposed for sale in Calcutta, will find a much readier market than it would have met with had the cakes been allowed to crack and crumble. When the cakes have dried sufficiently, the assortment of the colours may then be made. The indigo cakes are then packed into chests according to the assortment, and a specimen cake is kept from each chest and placed in the box of samples, with the number of the chest attached, and the whole is then sent to the Calcutta market. The facilities for irrigation being intimately connected with the production of the more valuable crops have next to be considered.\n\nIrrigation is extensively practised from wells (chahi), tanks and rivers (abi), and canals (nahari.)

Except in the kh\u0101d\u012brs of the rivers, and close to the canals, water is nowhere very near the surface, whilst at the same time it is not so far below as to prevent the formation and use of temporary earthen wells. The driest portions of the district are the parganahs of Khair and Atrauli, on the Jumna and the Ganges, and of these the portions nearest to the high bank of those rivers are particularly dry. The same rule holds good generally\u2014\"that on or near the watershed, and consequently the highest part of the D\u016bb, water is comparatively near the surface and the sub-soil is generally firm, while as the two rivers are approached the water-level sinks, the sub-soil becomes loose and sandy, and wells are made with difficulty and expense.\u201d Mr. W. H. Smith notices that in Igl\u0101s, which lies nearer the Jumna than H\u0101thras, the water is generally farther from the surface.\nthan in the latter tahsil, though the average irrigation capability is very good. For these reasons it is difficult to give the average depth of the level of the water from the surface of the ground in this district, but from 20 to 30 feet may be considered a fair approximation to the fact.\n\nFrom the imperfection of the records, it is not easy to give the areas irrigated during the last settlement, but Mr. Smith, from the existing data for H\u00e1thras and Murs\u00e1n, estimates a total irrigated area at last settlement amounting to 506,485 acres, and an unirrigated one of 332,642 acres, in the proportions of 60 and 40 per cent. of the cultivated area respectively. The irrigated area, according to the records of the recent settlement, amounts to 648,815 acres, with an unirrigated area of 248,357 acres, as shown above, or 72\u00b73 and 27\u00b77 per cent. on the cultivated area respectively. From these figures it would appear that irrigation has increased by 142,330 acres, or 28 per cent. The cost per acre of irrigation under each class is a much debated point. Some officers think that canal irrigation is cheaper than well irrigation, whilst others hold the opposite view. General experience goes to show that home-circle lands (b\u00e1ra and manjha) are usually irrigated from wells, even though canal water be available. The coldness of the canal water is supposed to be injurious to the tender plants. In the outlying lands (barha) canal water usually supersedes wells, and always does so in the case of indigo. Most of the wells in the district have been constructed by the cultivators themselves. There are over 51,000 wells, which roughly give an average area watered by each well of 10\u00b75 acres. Generally speaking, the wells may be divided into two classes,\u2014percolation wells and spring wells. Little dependence can be placed on the former, as half a day's labour will often suffice to exhaust the supply. The water in spring wells, where the sot or spring is reached, is practically unlimited. The popular classification of wells is, however, into pukka and kuchcha. Percolation wells are usually pukka or brickbuilt. Spring wells are of three kinds\u2014(1) pukka, where the sub-soil to the spring is sandy, and masonry is necessary throughout; (2) garduari, where the sub-soil is clay, but a layer of sand intervenes, and wooden frames are necessary to prevent the walls from falling in; or ajdr; where wicker-work is used for the same purpose; (3) kuchcha wells, made of clay throughout. The pukka wells number 11,000, and irrigate some 42 per cent. of the wet area irrigated from wells; kuchcha wells number 40,000, and irrigate the remainder. Comparing percentages with areas, the figures do not appear to tally; but it must be remembered that whereas pukka wells have always two l\u00e9os (buckets) or runs, and sometimes three or four, kuchcha wells have rarely more than one. The average area irrigated per run of a pukka well is nine to eleven acres, and per kuchcha well is six to eight acres. As a rule, wells can easily be constructed, except in the tracts close to the canal. Irrigation\nfrom ponds and tanks only amounts to 10,005 acres, and is confined to a few parganahs.\\(^1\\)\n\nThe length of the main Ganges Canal running through the district is 48\u00b762 miles, and from it 260\u00b712 miles of r\u00e9jbahas or principal distributaries, 49\u00b75 miles of minor r\u00e9jbahas, and 487\u00b762 miles of small channels (gills) are fed. In a few places, where the surface drainage has been impeded, and where percolation has taken place, the efflorescence of reh along the line of canal has increased. As a rule, it disappears with efficient drainage, and where it does exist, up to the present, the increased facilities for irrigation afforded by the canal more than reimburse the loss caused by reh.

Cereals in the particular crops, rabi, and indigo and cotton in the kharif, are the principal crops watered from the canal. In a good year for indigo the cultivation nearly doubles, falling again with reduced prices. A similar rule seems to hold good in regard to cotton; and owing to the presence of the canal, prices, when\nremunerative enough, can always obtain a full proportional supply of the raw material from this district:\n\n| Crops          | 1869-70 | 1870-71 | 1871-72 | 1872-73 |\n|----------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Gardens        | 1,485   | 1,267   | 1,478   | 1,890   |\n| Sugar-cane     | 147     | 206     | 245     | 401     |\n| Wheat          | 32,887  | 39,435  | 28,336  | 28,998  |\n| Barley         | 21,130  | 24,942  | 17,144  | 17,833  |\n| Rice           | 2       | 619     | 576     | 595     |\n| Other cereals  | 7,520   | 2,157   | 565     | 751     |\n| Fodder         | 199     | 15      | 45      | 39      |\n| Gram           | 4,259   | 1,613   | 1,489   | 2,243   |\n| Other pulses   | 318     | 585     | 177     | 170     |\n| Cotton         | 9,147   | 6,307   | 2,960   | 1,961   |\n| Other fibres   | 17      | 3       | 113     | 3       |\n| Indigo         | 38,788  | 35,631  | 40,776  | 35,689  |\n| Drugs          | 93      | 74      | 53      | 159     |\n| Oil-seeds      | 9       | 4       |         |         |\n\nThe district has suffered, in common with the rest of the Upper Du\u00e1b, from hailstorms and droughts. The first great drought that is still remembered is that of 1782-84. It was felt very severely in the district, and the sites of many villages are pointed out that were devastated during the *chalis* (1840 Sambat). Many died from starvation and others emigrated. For the previous two years the rains had been unfavourable and the produce very scanty. The famine year itself opened with an entire absence of rain in As\u00e1rh and S\u00e1wan (June to August). Then Bh\u00e1don came and clouds appeared, but no rain. The land remained unploughed, and the full force of the calamity fell at once upon those portions of the Du\u00e1b that were most distant from the rivers. About the middle of September the rains began and fell with such regularity that seed which had lain in the ground for two years, is said to have germinated. In 1803-04 and 1805-06 there were scarcities from a want of rain, the prevalence of hailstorms, and the disturbed state of the country, as no one knew whether he should be able to reap the crop that he had sown or should be obliged to leave it to another. In 1806-07 no rain fell until the 15th August, and no steady rain set in until the 4th of September.\u00b9 The distress continued to be felt to such a degree that in February, 1808, Government granted remissions to all except the great zam\u00ednd\u00e1rs, at the rate of three annas in the rupee.\u00b2 In September, 1808, there was still want of rain, and serious consequences were apprehended, as only one good shower had fallen during the previous month. The district participated in the droughts between 1813 and 1837.\n\n\u00b9 Board's Records, 36th July, 1806, No. 8.\n\u00b2 Ibid, 26th February, 1808, No. 1; 25th August, 1808, No. 48.\nWriting in 1826, the Collector represented that the preceding rain crop was very poor in Aligarh, and had been the source of great loss. The district had not had a good shower for six months, and many of the cultivators had emigrated. The Collector estimated that the cultivation of the cold-weather crops had fallen off by 8,000 bighas. \"Though the crops on the irrigated lands looked flourishing, yet the fields not under the influence of wells gave no room for hope of a tolerable harvest.\"\n\nIn 1837 the chaur\u00e1nause famine occurred, so called from 1894 Sambat, the corresponding year of the Hind\u00fa calendar. It is the year from which, until the mutiny, most of the poorer classes used to reckon their time, and to which they referred all their misfortunes. The mutiny has since taken the place of the chaur\u00e1nause k\u00e1l. In June, 1837, there was a shower of rain, but none fell in this district in July or August, and very little in September. The price of food-grains rapidly rose, crime increased and immense numbers of people flocked into the district from Rajput\u00e1na. Relief works were opened, but still the distress lasted for nearly a whole year; and to add to the sufferings of the people cholera broke out amongst the low Musalm\u00e1n population who lived on inferior meat. It is a curious fact that both in 1837 and 1856 easterly winds prevailed, and meat became bad in an abnormally short space of time. The suffering was intense, and far greater than that felt in 1860-61, when the introduction of the canal to a certain extent removed the ever-impending dread of starvation in seasons of drought. The influence of the canal was more clearly seen in 1868-69, when the returns showed 59 per cent. of the cultivated area as irrigated, and of this 129,088 acres got their water from the canal, and three-fourths of this area were under food-grains. Still the drought was very injurious to tracts like Khair and Atrauli which were unprotected by canals or wells. \"Owing to the late and scanty rains of July, 1868, a less breadth than usual of food-crops was sown, and the produce on dry lands was stunted and withered. The rain in September was of the utmost benefit in securing the spring sowings in quarters where irrigation was defective; but the autumn crop was too far gone for recovery, and the farmers showed their sense of the imminent danger of famine by planting carrots in every available spot round the wells. Towards the close of the year 1868 great fears were entertained for the spring crops. The long drought which intervened between the September storms and the middle of January, 1869, rendered it generally impossible to sow on any lands that were without means of irrigation; still, so beneficial were the effects of the cold-weather showers when they did arrive that not less than seven-eighths of an average crop was expected. The want of fodder was very pressing and farmers were obliged to supplement the usual food for cattle with the leaves of the b\u00e1b\u00fal tree. This was of course mitigated by the cold-weather rain.\"\n\"In respect of the grain traffic, the official reports from this district give no figures, but observations, here and there, indicate that the course of trade was much the same as elsewhere in the Northern Do\u00e1b, and the market no less sensitive. On the 18th September, the Collector informed Government that the heavy rain down country had checked exports. But on the 25th idem it was said that the prices of grain were kept up by the exports to the Panj\u00e1b, thus showing that the current had immediately turned westwards. In the middle of October, the exports slackened and prices fell, only to rise again in November, when the prospects of the rabi looked extremely bad. Generally it may be said regarding the grain trade that large supplies were attracted to the important mart of H\u00e1thras. Thence, to September, 1868, the export was eastwards. In September, October, and November grain was sent westwards and southwards, but chiefly to native states. With the beginning of 1869 the great drain for the Panj\u00e1b commenced, though the Collector says that he saw at the close of 1868 dispatches lying on the H\u00e1thras railway station, and destined both for Jalandhar and Jabalpur. Prices were considerably lowered by the spring harvest in April. They soon, however, rose again, and the Collector did not expect a decline until favourable rain should fall. But it seems more probable that the demand elsewhere ruled the market than that the outlook of the local agriculture was thought precarious. The rains of 1869 were in due time and abundant; a slight break occurred in August, 1869, but it was followed by magnificent showers all over the district. Still there was no decline in prices, on the contrary wheat was as dear in the autumn of 1869 as it had been in the winter of 1868.\"\n\n**Prices during the season of scarcity.**\n\n| Month       | Wheat | Barley | Bajra | Jo\u00e1r | Common rice | Gram |\n|-------------|-------|--------|-------|------|-------------|------|\n|             | M. s. | M. s.  | M. s. | M. s.| M. s.        |      |\n| February, 1869 | 14 8 | 16 0 | 14 8 | 15 0 | 10 0 | 15 8 |\n| March       | 15 0 | 19 0 | 18 0 | 14 0 | 11 0 | 14 0 |\n| April       | 18 8 | 18 19| 12 0 | 13 0 | 11 0 | 13 8 |\n| May         | 14 8 | 19 0 | ** | ** | 11 0 | 13 8 |\n| June        | 14 8 | 18 0 | 10 0 | 10 0 | 11 0 | 14 0 |\n| July        | 13 0 | 16 8 | 10 0 | 9 0 | 11 0 | 13 0 |\n| August      | 15 8 | 16 0 | 11 0 | 12 0 | 11 0 | 11 8 |\n| September   | 15 8 | 14 8 | 14 0 | 16 8 | 11 0 | 11 8 |\n| October     | 11 8 | 17 0 | 10 0 | 16 0 | 9 0 | 11 8 |\n| November    | 10 8 | 16 0 | 18 0 | 25 0 | 11 0 | 10 8 |\n| December    | 8 4 | 16 0 | 16 0 | 19 0 | 11 0 | 8 0 |\n| January, 1870 | 9 8 | 16 8 | 21 0 | 25 0 | 12 0 | 11 0 |\n| February    | 10 0 | 20 0 | 20 0 | 21 0 | 13 0 | 12 0 |\n| March       | 12 8 | 25 0 | 21 0 | 25 0 | 13 0 | 14 8 |\n| Average     | 13 2 | 16 0 | 15 2 | 16 3 | 10 9 | 13 9 |\nThe prices given are those ruling during the last week of the month, as given in Mr. Henvey's report.\n\nTahsil H\u00e1thras is infested with the weed called *ba\u00edsur\u00e1di*. The roots of this plant are said to penetrate the soil to a depth of twenty feet or more, so that where it once takes possession of the soil it is in effect ineradicable. \"The rains seem to keep it down, and in the case of the khar\u00edf crop it entails little inconvenience; but immediately after the conclusion of the rainy season, wherever it has taken root, it completely covers the ground, and from a distance looks like a dense green cultivated crop. Constant cutting is the only remedy, and this must be done three or four times during the growth of a *s\u00e1b\u00ed* crop. The weed generally grows so thickly that the operation of cutting requires much more labour and time than ordinary weeding, and cultivation therefore, where the weed abounds, is expensive. Opinions as to its ultimate effect on the crop are various. Some assert that it materially diminishes produce, some deny this; my own view is that it is a matter of industry only.\" When it is cut as often as it emerges from the soil, and is never allowed to grow high enough to incommode the rising crop, it has very little (if any) deleterious effect on the produce. When the cultivation has been careful, I have seen the very finest and richest crops on *ba\u00edsur\u00e1di*-infested land; on the other hand, where husbandry is lax and the weed is allowed to make head, the crop naturally grows up thin and poor. Its worst characteristic is its tendency to spread. It is now common in numbers of villages, which, at the time of last settlement, were not affected.\" *Ba\u00edsur\u00e1di* and, to the south-west, *k\u00e1ns* are the greatest enemies to good cultivation that are to be met with in these Provinces.\n\nAt the commencement of British rule the surface of the country was covered with large tracts of jungle, principally of *dh\u00e1k* (*Butea frondosa*). These have generally given way before increasing cultivation, and what remains is fast disappearing. In fact, with the exception of a preserved tract in Chandaus belonging to the Pis\u00e1wa zam\u00edn-d\u00e1rs, there is now little *dh\u00e1k* jungle, and there are few trees of any size or value in any part of the district. The total area under groves, such as mango and other fruit trees, &c., is 5,676 acres, of which nearly one-half is in Gang\u00edr\u00ee and Sikandra Rao. There are few districts which have such a bare appearance, and nowhere more efforts should be made to induce the people to plant trees. This has been partially attained by the Government allowing a remission of revenue for lands under groves as long as they are maintained; and no doubt in a few years we may expect some improvement in this direction. The principal plantation trees are *n\u00edm*, *mango*, *j\u00e1man*, *pip\u00e1l*, *b\u00e1bul*, *mah\u00fala*, *fards*, and *ber*. *S\u00e1l* and the better sorts of timber for building purposes are imported.\n\n---\n\n1 Mr. W. H. Smith.\nThe building materials of the district are brick and block kunkur; there is no stone. Block kunkur costs about a rupee per hundred cubic feet to quarry, and eight annas per hundred cubic feet per mile to transport. Bricks, the smaller size, Rs. 150 to 200 per lakh. The larger size (gumbar), Rs. 500 to 800 per hundred thousand. Kunkur lime is worth about ten rupees per hundred maunds; kunkur for roads, 24 to 32 annas for digging 100 maunds, and the transport per mile is about the same as for block kunkur. Kunkur quarries exist in considerable numbers all over the district. Road kunkur can be laid down on the side of the road at a cost of about Rs. 225 per mile of twelve feet wide and six inches deep. Nim karls or joists sell at a rupee each; mango, jaman, and the like at Rs. 18 a score; and fer\u00e9s and ber at Rs. 8 a score.\n\nPART III.\n\nINHABITANTS OF THE DISTRICT.\n\nThe first census took place in 1847, and gives a total population of 739,356 souls, or 455 to the square mile. There were 651,792 Hind\u00fas, of whom 336,150 were engaged in occupations unconnected with agriculture. The Musalm\u00e1ns numbered 87,564 souls, of whom 21,880 were engaged in cultivation. The villages numbered 1,964, of which 1,895 were inhabited; and of these 1,782 had less than 1,000 inhabitants, 106 had between 1,000 and 5,000, and there were seven towns containing more than 5,000 inhabitants, viz., Harduanganj, 5,942; S\u00e1mi, 5,524; Patti Umda Begam (Sikandra Rao), 7,195; Ahmadnagar, 6,740; Atrauli, 12,722; H\u00e1thras, 22,903; and Koil, 36,181. The town population therefore numbered 97,207 souls, or 11\u00b77 per cent. of the total population, whilst in the whole district the agricultural population amounted to less than one half the total number of inhabitants.\n\nThis enumeration was followed by the regular census taken in 1852 and reported in 1853, which showed a total population of 1,134,565, or 527 souls to the square mile. There were 1,013,874 Hind\u00fas, of whom 502,513 were cultivators; and 121,191 were Musalm\u00e1ns, of whom 29,582 were agriculturists. There were only fourteen villages added to the district in the interval between 1847 and 1852, and this will not account for the great difference in the results. Mr. J. Hutchinson, who conducted the census of 1852, declares the enumeration of 1847 \"to be totally incorrect, and no dependence can be placed upon it.\" Subsequent enumerations would lead one to suppose that he was right in his estimate, for though M\u00e1rahra and Pachl\u00e1na were transferred to Eta between 1852 and 1865, and deducting their population the figures for Aligarh should be 1,026,690, or 516 to the square mile, the census taken in 1865 more nearly approaches the total given in 1852.\nthan that given in 1847. The relative population of the villages remain nearly the same, but the number of towns having more than 5,000 inhabitants has increased from eight in 1847, to twelve in 1852, by the inclusion of Jal\u00e1li, Tappal, Khair, Shahgarh, Murs\u00e1n, and M\u00e1rabra, whilst Hardnagarj and Ahmadnagar were excluded. The urban population in 1852 was 153,463 souls, or 13\u00b75 per cent. of the total number of inhabitants, whilst the proportion of agriculturists remained about the same.\n\nThe census of 1865 shows the total population at 926,588, giving 498 souls to the square mile. The distribution according to sex, age, religion, and occupation of the Hind\u00fa and Musalm\u00e1n population may be briefly shown as follows:\n\n|                | AGRICULTURAL |                |                |\n|----------------|--------------|----------------|----------------|\n|                | Males.       | Females.       |                |\n|                | Adults.      | Boys.          | Adults.        | Girls.         |\n| Hind\u00fas         | 133,179      | 73,099         | 109,361        | 60,504         |\n| Musalm\u00e1ns & others | 7,437     | 4,766          | 6,669          | 3,903          |\n| Total          | 140,606      | 77,865         | 116,030        | 64,407         |\n\n|                | NON-AGRICULTURAL |                |                |\n|                | Males.       | Females.       |                |\n|                | Adults.      | Boys.          | Adults.        | Girls.         |\n| Hind\u00fas         | 148,210      | 90,805         | 139,805        | 67,510         |\n| Musalm\u00e1ns & others | 26,069    | 16,094         | 25,458         | 13,679         |\n| Total          | 174,279      | 106,899        | 165,263        | 80,189         |\n\nIn addition to the above, there were 484 persons employed in the railway, 566 in military occupations, and 166 Europeans and Eurasians. The number of villages is given at 1,799, of which 1,625 had less than 1,000 inhabitants, 166 had between 1,000 and 5,000, and only eight towns existed with more than 5,000 inhabitants, viz., Murs\u00e1n, Tappal, Jal\u00e1li, Hardnagarj, Sikandra Rao, Atrauli, H\u00e1thras, and Koil. The decrease between 1853 and 1865 amounts to ten per cent., and is wholly inexplicable.\n\nThe census of 1872 gives the total population at 1,073,333, or 547 persons to the square mile. Of these, 955,121 were Hind\u00fas, 117,911 were Musalm\u00e1ns, 239 were non-Asiatics, and 62 were Native Christians. There were 1,750 villages, giving an average of 0\u00b79 villages to each square mile, and 613 inhabitants to each village. The actual classification of villages showed 422 with less than 200 inhabitants, 693 with between 200 and 500, 411 with between 500 and 1,000, 168 having from 1,000 to 2,000, 47 having from 2,000 to 5,000, and nine above 5,000. These last include the towns mentioned in 1865, with the addition of Bijasgarh or Gambhira. The\nsettlement records give the average area in acres of the villages in each taluq as follows:\u2014Koil, 639; Igl\u00e1s, 604; Atrauli, 737; H\u00e1thras, 481; Sikandra Rao, 853; and Khair, 922. The next table gives the population, divided into agriculturists and those following other occupations; and the succeeding table shows the details of population for each parganah according to sex, age, and religion, from the census returns of 1872.\n\n| Land-owners | Agriculturists | Non-agriculturists | Total |\n|-------------|----------------|--------------------|-------|\n|             | Male | Female | Male | Female | Male | Female | Male | Female |\n| Hind\u00fas      | 12,340 | 10,522 | 225,189 | 184,440 | 278,023 | 244,198 | 515,561 | 439,550 |\n| Musalm\u00e1ns   | 1,745 | 1,903 | 10,796 | 9,345 | 49,115 | 45,195 | 61,656 | 56,255 |\n| Christians  | 14    | 15    | ...    | ...    | 33    | 15    | 46    | 30    |\n| **Total**   | **14,109** | **12,442** | **235,985** | **194,085** | **337,169** | **289,318** | **577,363** | **495,845** |\n\n| Parganah | Hind\u00fas | Muhammadans and Others Not Hindu | Total |\n|----------|--------|----------------------------------|-------|\n|          | Up to 15 years | Adults | Up to 15 years | Adults | Male | Female | Male | Female |\n| Koil     | 34,458 | 28,463 | 53,594 | 45,547 | 6,883 | 5,883 | 10,781 | 10,059 |\n| Baranll  | 1,967  | 1,875  | 3,591  | 3,458  | 249   | 317   | 810    | 825    |\n| Murth\u00e1l  | 6,806  | 4,878  | 7,655  | 7,004  | 349   | 314   | 595    | 446    |\n| Sikandra Rao | 25,957 | 20,907 | 37,183 | 31,476 | 2,910 | 2,518 | 4,085 | 3,928 |\n| Akramad  | 12,987 | 10,962 | 17,921 | 15,628 | 1,675 | 1,499 | 3,483 | 2,942 |\n| Gorai    | 9,922  | 8,068  | 14,988 | 13,547 | 606   | 646   | 732    | 797    |\n| Bhanangar| 13,344 | 12,777 | 20,177 | 19,110 | 740   | 651   | 1,199 | 1,036 |\n| Gangapur | 14,709 | 11,961 | 19,269 | 17,495 | 2,998 | 2,685 | 3,920 | 3,650 |\n| Atrauli  | 16,086 | 15,059 | 21,460 | 19,571 | 2,901 | 2,013 | 3,184 | 2,172 |\n| H\u00e1thras  | 20,756 | 25,551 | 47,411 | 41,970 | 2,998 | 2,548 | 6,635 | 3,971 |\n| Mure\u00e1n   | 9,386  | 7,844  | 14,444 | 12,423 | 727   | 606   | 1,118 | 1,001 |\n| Tappal   | 12,353 | 9,698  | 16,769 | 15,422 | 1,008 | 885   | 1,204 | 1,269 |\n| Chandaus | 7,994  | 6,503  | 10,800 | 9,896  | 784   | 689   | 1,096 | 956   |\n| Khair    | 16,680 | 11,974 | 21,597 | 19,059 | 1,093 | 946   | 1,663 | 1,589 |\n| **Total**| **210,633** | **171,818** | **304,929** | **268,342** | **24,720** | **21,891** | **36,989** | **34,394** |\n\nThe number of Hind\u00fa males was 515,561, or 54\u00b70 per cent. of the entire Hind\u00fa population; Hind\u00fa females number 439,560, or 46\u00b70 per cent.; Musalm\u00e1n males, 61,656, or 52\u00b73 per cent. of the entire Musalm\u00e1n population; and Musalm\u00e1n females, 56,255, or 47\u00b77 per cent. The percentage of Hind\u00fas on the total population is 89\u00b70, and of Musalm\u00e1ns is 11\u00b70, or one Musalm\u00e1n\nto every nine Hind\u00fas. The percentage of males in the total population is 53\u00b78, and of females is 46\u00b72, whilst the divisional percentages are 54\u00b70 and 46\u00b70 respectively.\n\nThe statistics relating to infirmities show that in 1872 amongst the total population of the district there were 83 insane persons (35 females), or 0\u00b77 per 10,000 of the population; 62 idiots (13 females), or 0\u00b76 per 10,000 inhabitants; 167 deaf and dumb (53 females), or 1\u00b76 per 10,000; 3,222 blind (1,634 females), or 30\u00b70 per 10,000; and 240 lepers (23 females), or 2\u00b72 per 10,000.

Taking the quinquennial periods up to 15 years of age, or 0 to 5, 5 to 10, and 10 to 15 years, the percentage of both sexes to the total population is 18\u00b79, 11\u00b78, and 9\u00b71 respectively; or taking females only, the numbers are 19\u00b76, 11\u00b74, and 7\u00b79 per cent. Here, as all throughout the division, females are slightly in excess of males in the first period, and considerably below them in the other two. In the third period males show 10\u00b71 to 7\u00b79 females. This is no doubt due to the systematic concealment of the females of marriageable age. Again, taking the total population of the same sex and religion, only the proportion of Hind\u00fa males of the ages of 10 to 13 to all the\nHind\u00fa males is 5\u00b77, and of Hind\u00fa females to all Hind\u00fa females is only 4\u00b75; whilst Musalm\u00e1ns show 5\u00b74 and 4\u00b74 respectively. From the ages of 13 to 20 the proportion of Hind\u00fa males to the total of the same sex and religion is 16 per cent., and of Hind\u00fa females is 15\u00b72 per cent., whilst Musalm\u00e1ns show 16 and 16\u00b73 per cent. These results support the conclusion that the enumeration of females from ten to fifteen years of age is defective.\n\nDistributing the Hind\u00fa population, numbering 955,121 souls, amongst the four great classes, we have 148,249 Brahmans (67,556 females), 88,414 Rajp\u00fats (38,900 females), 53,444 Baniyas (24,999 females), and the great mass of the inhabitants included in 'the other castes' of the census returns, which number 664,914 souls, of whom 308,095 are females. Amongst the Brahmans, 24,393 belong to the great Gaur subdivision, 8,299 are San\u00e1dhs, 7,488 are Saraswats, 1,226 Kanaujiyas, and the remainder are unspecified in the census returns, or belong to minor subdivisions. The Gaurs connect their name with the ancient kingdom of Gaur in Bengal, and say that they came to the Upper Du\u00e1b to assist Raja Janamej\u00e1ya in his great snake-sacrifice, and, like the Tagas, received a grant of lands in return for their services. The Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata opens with an account of the snake-sacrifice performed by Janamej\u00e1ya in revenge for the death of his father, Parikshit, who had been bitten by a snake. Janamej\u00e1ya subsequently killed a Brahman, and in expiation of this crime, amongst other austerities, he listened to the recital of the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata by Vais\u00e1mp\u00e1yana, a pupil of Vy\u00e1sa. Some time afterwards a dispute as to the ritual to be observed in certain cases arose between the Raja and the Brahman, and the former perished in consequence of the curse pronounced upon him by the enraged priest.\u00b9 The story of the immigration from Bengal is too improbable to be accepted. The Gaurs would have to pass through the country of the Jajhotiya and Kanaujiya Brahmans, where now hardly a trace of them is to be found, and they are almost confined to the Meerut Division and the adjacent districts of Rohilkhand. Gaur, too, was only made the capital of Bengal a short time before the Musalm\u00e1n invasion, and the present tribes of Gaur Brahmans, Tagas, and Rajp\u00fats were settled here long before Mahm\u00fad ever left Ghazni. There can be little doubt but that the name is connected with Gauda or Gaura (now called Gonda), a subdivision of the district of Uttara Kosala in Oudh, lying to the south of the Rapt\u00ed (R\u00e1vati). The ancient city of Sr\u00e1vasti is said in the Pur\u00e1\u1e47as to be in Gauda, and modern research identifies Sr\u00e1vasti with Sahet-mahet, 12 miles from Balr\u00e1mpur in the Gonda district.\u00b2 Sr\u00e1vasti was the seat of a powerful dynasty of the solar race who ruled until the fourth century, when they appear to have fallen amid the general dissolution of the eastern kingdoms. About the beginning of the Christian era\n\n\u00b9 Vish. Pur., IV, 162. \u00b2 Arch. Sur., I, 330; Beames' Elliot, I, 102.\nreligious differences may have led to the emigration of the Brahmans and others from the Gaurian kingdom, for we know that fierce disputes raged between the Buddhists and the followers of the old law about that time, and that at the same time the Gaurians settled in the Upper Du\u00e1b. There are a few Gautam Brahmans who say that they belong to the Maithila division. The San\u00e1dhs are a branch of the Kanaujiyas, and intermarry with both Kanaujiyas and Gaurs. As landholders they form cultivating communities, and are good agriculturists, and, as a rule, do not claim or expect favour in rent. The Saraswats are those who come from the sacred river Saraswati or Sarasuti in the Panjab. Brahmans altogether form an important portion of the proprietary body in this district, and they own 244 villages, with an area of 113,576 acres.\n\nAmongst the Rajputs the following clans are the most important:\u2014J\u00e1don (36,423), Chauh\u00e1n (15,408), Kir\u00e1r (9,352), Pundir (6,125), Jangh\u00e1ra (3,490), Barg\u00fajar (3,429), Gahlot (3,085), Surajbansi (1,160), Bh\u00e1l (1,009), Bais (948), Panw\u00e1r (952), Gaharw\u00e1r (905), Rahtor (801), Tomar (749), S\u00edkharw\u00e1r (354), Geur (459), Jaisw\u00e1r (490), Rachhal, Bangar, Barkhar, Bharadw\u00e1j, Chandel; Chhonkar, Dh\u00e1kra, Gautam, Joliya, Kachhw\u00e1ha, Porach, Parwal, Mandwal, Khajuniya, Raghubansi, Raikw\u00e1r, Solankhi, Seengar, and Tanak. The remainder are unspecified. The J\u00e1dons belong to the B\u00e1gri or inferior division of the tribe, and are not on an equality with the J\u00e1dons of J\u00e9war in Bulandshahr and those of the native state of Karauli. The principal landed proprietors of this tribe are the talukd\u00e1rs of Somna in this district, and Awa Misa in the Muttra district, noticed hereafter under the principal families of the district. The J\u00e1dons claim descent from Sri Krishna, and through him from Y\u00e1du of the Lunar race. Those living in this district trace their origin to Muttra and Bate-sar, whence they spread over all the neighbouring country. They are now most numerous in tahsil Koil and in parganahs Akraibad, Sikandra, Atrauli, Gorai, Hasangarh, and Khair. Many, however, belong to the pure Y\u00e1dava race, and an account of them will be found under Muttra. The Chhonkars or Chonkars claim descent from the Karanli J\u00e1dons, but common report makes them a spurious branch derived from the marriage of a J\u00e1don and a shokri or female servant. The Chauh\u00e1ns are scattered all over the district, but are the prevailing clan in Khair, Chandans, and Morthal. Bhup\u00e1l Singh of Khair, the head of the clan in this district, was hanged for rebellion in the mutiny. They claim descent from Raja Sangat, the great-grandson of Ch\u00e1hira Deva, the brother of Prithir\u00e1j, one of whose numerous progeny settled in Khair. The Chauh\u00e1n clan will be noticed at length under the Mainpuri district. Kir\u00e1rs are a numerous clan, and, though numbered amongst Rajputs, are held to be of very inferior rank: They are good cultivators, but as proprietors they have lost more than half their villages during the last settlement. They claim to be a branch of\nthe J\u0101dons, and say that they came from the west, and are descendants of one Kunwar or Karanli P\u0101l. They have occupied villages in this and the Mainpuri district since the middle of the fifteenth century.\n\nThe Pundirs, also called Purirs, form an important clan, and in this district are more prosperous than any other of the old Rajput clans. The Jangh\u0101ras give the derivation of their name asjang (war) and \u0101dra (hungry), or those who hunger after war; but their enemies say that they might as well derive the name from 'jang' and '\u0101dra' (worsted), those who were overcome in war. The Bargujars have been noticed under the Bulandshahr district. Gahlots are one of the thirty-six royal tribes, and formerly held large possessions in this district. This clan is divided into two great branches, the Sisodhiya and Ah\u0101riya. The branch in this district is the Sisodhiya, which is the same as that to which the R\u0101na of Udepur or Mew\u0101r, the premier Raja of Rajputana and the \"sun of the Hind\u016bs,\" belongs. Tod devotes a large portion of his first volume to the annals of the Gahlots of Mew\u0101r. The Gahlots are of the Solar race, and trace their descent from Lava, the eldest son of the deified hero R\u0101ma. They emigrated from Oudh and settled at Dv\u0101rak\u0101 in Gujrat, and on their expulsion from thence settled in Mew\u0101r and changed their name to Gahlot. One branch made the town of Ar or Ah\u0101r, in the valley of the present capital of Udepur, their chief seat, and were hence called Ah\u0101riyas, whilst another branch settled in Sisodha on their expulsion from Ch\u012bt\u014dr, and founded the present house of Mew\u0101r. The origin of the name Gahlot is said to be in this wise: on the expulsion of the clan from Gujrat, the queen Pushpavati alone escaped the sack of the capital (Balabhi), where her husband, the celebrated Sil\u0101ditya, was slain. This event happened in 523 A.D. The queen fled to a cave in the hills and was there delivered of a son, whom she named Guha or the cave-born. His descendant Bappa seized on Ch\u012bt\u014dr in 727 A.D., and founded the Gahlot dynasty of Mew\u0101r, who subsequently removed to Udepur. The Persian historians make Naushir\u0101zad, son of Naushirw\u0101n, or Maha Bann, daughter of Yezdijird, the source of the present Sisodhiya line. The Gahlot prince of Ch\u012bt\u014dr married the sister of Prithir\u0101j, and it is to this connection is due the presence of Gahlots in the Upper Du\u0101b. They all say that they came to assist the Chauh\u0101n prince of Dehli in his numerous wars, and that in reward he gave them over the lands of the Meos and the Dors. Chand Bardai mentions Gobind Rao, Gahlot, as one of Prithir\u0101j's auxiliaries. The Bulandshahr Gahlots say that they settled near D\u0101sna under Raja Khum\u0101n at an early period. A long inscription in a m\u0101\u1e6d behind the temple of Aohalevara on mount Abu, bearing date 1286 A.D., speaks in high praise of the liberal race of Guhila, so early had the name been fixed. But here Guhila is made the son of Vappaka, and\n\n---\n\n1 Madras Edition, I., 175-561. 2 Thomas's Prinsep, U.T., 252. Their enemies say that the correct derivation is from guhla, a slave girl. 3 Tod, I., 198.\nit is said that the name Guhila \"is attached to the princes who have been born in his race.\" Some say that the Guhila Rajputs are distinct from the Gahlots, and this may be due to a branch formed by this Guhila, son of Bappu, the conqueror of Chitor.\n\nThe Bhais are noticed under the Bulandshahr district. The Bhattis or Jaiswars also call themselves a branch of the Jadon stock. They came from Jaisalmer, and many of them have become Musalmans in this and the neighbouring districts. They say, as usual, that they came here in the time of Prithviraj; in fact this era is quite as common in the district as 'the Norman Conquest' is in England. The Porach clan formerly possessed Daryapur, Hathras, Mendu, and Hussain, but all have now passed out of their hands. They are old settlers in the district, and were contemporaries of the Dors and Moos before the Musalman conquest. The returns of 1872 show only 83 Dors in this district, which once 'almost entirely' belonged to them. None of the other Rajput clans require any particular notice here. Altogether Rajputs still possess 544 villages, with an area of 346,648 acres in this district, in full proprietary right.\n\nBaniyas belong to the following subdivisions:\u2014Barahsaini (14,049), Agarwal (15,027), Dasa (4,512), Jaiswar (2,684), Maseeri (3,472), Gaharwal (2,890), Chausaini (2,521), Khandelwal (1,172), Sarangi (1,222), Lohiya, Mahar, Badhpeta, Bishnoi, Baranwal, Ghoi, Rastaugi, &c., They are an important and wealthy class, and have now 210 villages, comprising 115,450 acres in this district. They are chiefly absentees, following their trades of money-lending and brokerage in the principal towns. Before the last settlement they held only 41 villages, and have occupied their present position entirely of late years. The Agarwals claim descent from Raja Ugrasen of Agroha in the Sarsa district of the Panjab. They are divided into two great branches,\u2014the Bisa and Dasa. Ugrasen is said to have married the daughter of Vasuki, the Rasa of the Nagas, and by her he had eighteen sons, of whom seventeen founded the gots of the Agarwals, and the eighteenth became the guru of the rest. Agroha was destroyed by Shihab-ad-din Ghori. The Dasas of the original stock are descendants of the concubines of Ugrasen, and are called Kadimi Dasas, to distinguish them from the new families of impure origin who adopt the name. They are also called Raja-ke-baradari, from one of their members having obtained the title of Raja in the reign of Farrukhsiyar. The Chausaini or Chauseni is considered rather a low caste even amongst Baniyas. They say that they came from Muttra and are descendants of one of the wrestlers of Raja Kana, to whom the Chamars also look up as their progenitor. The Dhusars are said to have come from Riwari. They are a spurious clan, who assume to themselves the name of Brahman, and often that of Bhargava or descendants of the Muni Bhrigu.\nAs in other districts, the great mass of the population comes under the head of other castes. The following table gives the names and numbers of each of the principal other castes found in Aligarh in 1872:\n\n| Other castes | Numbers |\n|--------------|---------|\n| Ah\u00e1r         | 1,808   |\n| Ahiriy\u00e1      | 7,461   |\n| Ahir         | 26,578  |\n| Baheliya     | 9       |\n| Banj\u00e1ra      | 2,852   |\n| Burha        | 38,188  |\n| Bari         | 357     |\n| Beda         | 66      |\n| Bharbhunja   | 1,834   |\n| Bh\u00e1t         | 4,185   |\n| Bhati        | 18      |\n| Borah        | 178     |\n| Cham\u00e1r       | 178,126 |\n| Chhipi       | 2,709   |\n| Chobdar      | 216     |\n| Darzi        | 6,847   |\n| Dhanak       | 467     |\n| Dhobi        | 13,838  |\n| Dhuma        | 7,285   |\n| Dom          | 17      |\n| Garariya     | 82,788  |\n| Ghosi        | 602     |\n| G\u00e1jar        | 640     |\n| Hab\u00edra       | 909     |\n| Hajj\u00e1n       | 23,076  |\n| J\u00e1t          | 89,592  |\n| Jot\u00edshi      | 834     |\n| J\u00fat\u00e1ha       | 381     |\n| K\u00e1dh\u00ed        | 19,211  |\n| Kah\u00e1r        | 26,049  |\n| Kal\u00e1l        | 12,796  |\n| Kanjar       | 1,139   |\n| Kayath       | 8,645   |\n| Kh\u00e1krob      | 24,833  |\n| Khat\u00edk       | 19,994  |\n| Khattr\u00ed      | 1,616   |\n| Koll         | 25,081  |\n| Kumh\u00e1r       | 10,550  |\n| Kunj\u00e1ra      | 218     |\n| K\u00e1rm\u00ed        | 460     |\n| Lodha        | 38,526  |\n| Loh\u00e1r        | 2,068   |\n| Mium\u00e1r       | 1,110   |\n| Mall         | 5,786   |\n| Vall\u00e1h      | 2,159   |\n| Manh\u00e1r       | 81      |\n| Mathuriya    | 18      |\n| Meo          | 805     |\n| Mochi        | 503     |\n| Nat          | 375     |\n| Nanera       | 493     |\n| Orh          | 3,866   |\n| Patwa        | 93      |\n| Ramaiya      | 46      |\n| Riw\u00e1ri       | 554     |\n| Sangtar\u00e1sh   | 23      |\n| Sun\u00e1r        | 5,918   |\n| Taga         | 7       |\n| T\u00edmol\u00ed       | 328     |\n| Taw\u00e1lif      | 21      |\n| Teii         | 3,690   |\n| Thathera     | 144     |\n| Agb\u00f3ri       | 552     |\n| Balr\u00e1gl      | 5,099   |\n| Fakr         | 14      |\n| Gosh\u00e1m       | 2,752   |\n| Jogi         | 5,097   |\n| Marw\u00e1ri      | 29      |\n| M\u00edna         | 496     |\n\nThe Cham\u00e1rs are the most numerous, and form the bulk of the labouring population, and even 16-5 per cent. of the total population. Some few of them have attained to considerable prosperity, but as a rule they are mere serfs of the proprietor, tied to the soil, and going with it on occasions of transfer. In fact no sharer will think a partition complete until an adequate number of Cham\u00e1rs has been allotted to his share in proportion to his interests in the estate. J\u00e1ts are the most industrious and painstaking of all the cultivating classes. There is a great spirit of rivalry between them and the Rajp\u00fats, so that these two castes seldom reside in the same village, and if let alone would at once fly at each others' throats. In the mutiny \"the old J\u00e1t and Rajp\u00fat feud raged strongly in the western portions of the district, and was only stopped by news arriving of the fall of Delhi.\"\n\nThe J\u00e1ts are decidedly the most powerful amongst these 'other castes.' They hold amongst them 452 villages as proprietors, and belong chiefly to the Tenwa, Th\u00e1kurel, Khandiya, and Ch\u00e1buk subdivisions. They occupy nearly the whole of the western portion of the district. A notice of the clan is given under the Meerut district, and a short sketch\nof their local history is only necessary here. The Khandiya got prevails in Tappal, the Th\u00e1kurel in Hasangarh, and the Tenwa in Gorai, Murs\u00e1n, and H\u00e1thras. The history of the Tenwa got will be found hereafter under the history of the Murs\u00e1n and H\u00e1thras talukas. The Th\u00e1kurels of the Hasangarh or Lagasw\u00e1n parganah, say that they came here in 1046 A.D. under Vikrama Th\u00e1kur, and expelled the Jangh\u00e1ras and Kal\u00e1rs, whose lands they formed into 54 villages, and held possession of these until the British occupation, when very many of the villages fell into the hands of the money-lenders. The Khandiya J\u00e1ts take their name from the village of Khandiya in parganah Tappal, where they settled at a very early date, and spread all over the parganah. The Pis\u00e1wa taluk\u00e1d\u00e1rs are of the Ch\u00e1buk got, and are noticed hereafter. The J\u00e1ts in the eastern parganahs are chiefly those who settled in the district during its usurpation by the Bharptpur Raja, towards the close of the last century. They do not seem to have settled and multiplied in the way that the western J\u00e1ts have done, and are altogether not so prosperous.\n\nAhars and Aheriyas are chiefly found in the Atrauli parganah, in the sandy tracts towards the Ganges, where they eke out their professional livelihood of robbery and cattle-breeding by tilling the land for enough food to support themselves throughout the year. Mr. Smith writes of the Aheriyas:\u2014\"Their profession is theft, robbery, or dakaiti, and the Aheriyas of Aligarh are notorious in the adjoining districts to which their crimes are mostly confined. They form a sort of powerful secret society, and under the name of cultivators are mere robbers and murderers; and there can be little doubt, whether from fear or sympathy, they receive ample support and assistance from many of the proprietors of their villages.\" Ahirs own some ten villages, and are pretty numerous in Sikandra Rao and Atrauli. In the former tahsil they have the character of being fair cultivators, but in Atrauli they are said to be idle, lazy and careless. The soil may have something to do with this state of things, as in Atrauli it is sandy, and the Ganges kh\u00e1dir affords good pasturage for cattle, the breeding of which is the Ahirs' hereditary occupation. In Sikandra Rao there is no waste land, and the peasantry must depend upon the cultivation of the soil for their maintenance. Lodhas hold 25 villages in Koil, Atrauli, and Akrabad, and seem to have acquired the management of their villages during the troubled times of the Marhatta supremacy in the last century. Khattris hold 18 villages. K\u00e1chhis are chiefly found in H\u00e1thras, Sikandra Rao, and Atrauli, and here, as elsewhere, are market gardeners. They are few in number in each village, and cultivate the small holdings that they possess very highly. The more they work the more is exacted from them, whilst with the lazy Gujjar and the Aheriya dakait, the less they do and the more they make their neighbours afraid of them, the better off they are.\nGarariyas are chiefly found in Sikandra, Koil, and Atrauli. As a rule they are sheep breeders, but many villages in this district are altogether cultivated by them, and they own one; they make fair agriculturists. Kayaths hold 77 villages, most of which are hereditary amongst the descendants of former parganah officials. They held 61 of these villages in 1838. The Lodhas are among the best agriculturists in the district, and hold 25 villages as proprietors. They are chiefly to be found in Koil, Atrauli, and Akrabed, and assumed the management of their villages during the struggle for life at the close of the last century. The Meos, who once owned so much of the land, the Ishmaelites of the twelfth to the fifteenth centuries, now have but one village. Bohras, a money-making class, vie with their trade-fellows, Baniyas and the usurer Brahmans, in their careful money-getting habits. But it would appear that the Brahman money-lender is more grasping than either. \"To the power derived from the possession of money they add the influence of caste, and some of them have been among the largest accumulators of property in the district. As a class they are accused of every sort of fraud and chicanery; and if half the tales told are founded on truth, in times not so long past, when there was less careful supervision than now over the subordinate civil courts, their predecessors must have been a curse to the country. They have had most success among the formerly heavily-assessed proprietary communities; and within the last 50 years two wealthy families have grown up in the south of the district\u2014one, that of Ganga Ram of Kanchhauri among the Jats of Iglas; and another, that of Gaj Singh of Lakhnau, among the Jats and Porach Thakurs of Hathras.\"\n\nThe Musalmans in the census returns of 1872 are divided into Shaikhs (16,459), Sayyids (4,180), Mughals (1,192), Pathans (15,226), Mivatis (2,040), and unspecified, 78,774. Amongst the latter class must be included the great mass of converted Hindus or Nau Muslins, who hold 78 villages in the district. Many of them are absenteeees and residents of Bulandshahr, but many also live in the district. The Jalali Sayyids are the most noteworthy of their class in the district. Though a small community, they are distinguished by the number of servants that they have given to the State. The Sayyids hold 55 villages. Mughals hold only 7 villages, and are of little importance. Shaikhs hold 35 villages, and Pathans are owners of 232 villages, many of which are included in the Datauli and Bhikampur talukas. A fakir has one village. The Musalmans as a rule are exacting, though not absolutely severe landlords, like the money-lenders and the Jatons of Awa Missa. They get as much as they can out of their tenants, but help them largely in times of scarcity and need. Europeans, or rather Eurasians, hold 51 villages; they make good landlords when they look after their villages themselves, but as a rule they are more in the hands of their agents than others. The district returns of 1872 showed 123 English, 12 Scotch, 16 Irish, 10 French,\nand 17 Europeans whose nationality was not specified. There were also two Australians, 61 Eurasians, and 62 Native Christians. Few of these are permanent residents; the railway brings an ever-changing population from all countries amongst its servants, and the European census above given may not hold good for a single year.\n\nThe census of 1872 for the first time has attempted to collect statistics regarding the occupations of the people. The distribution of the population into the two great divisions of agriculturists and those following occupations unconnected with the cultivation of the soil has been sufficiently noticed in the preceding pages. The agriculturists as a body will be described hereafter, and here we have chiefly to speak of the subdivision of the non-agricultural classes. The whole population was divided for the purposes of the census of 1872 into six great classes, each of which had several subdivisions, and included all the male adults engaged in the occupations it represents. The first or professional class embraces all Government servants, soldiers, and persons following the learned professions, literature, the arts and sciences, and numbered 4,319 male adults (not less than fifteen years of age), amongst whom are included 1,296 uprohites or family priests, 1,686 pandits, 160 baidas or physicians, 376 singers, &c. The second class numbered 45,965 members, and comprised all males engaged in domestic service, as cooks, washermen, sweepers, water-carriers, and the like. The third class represents commerce, and numbered 22,849, amongst whom are all persons who buy or sell, keep or lend money and goods of various kinds, as money-lenders (1,527), shopkeepers (11,934), bankers (375), and all persons engaged in the conveyance of men, animals, or goods, as pack-carriers, okka-drivers, porters, &c. (4,923). The fourth class includes persons possessing or working the land as proprietors (8,988), cultivators (146,040), ploughmen, gardeners and nut-growers, and every one engaged about animals, as shepherds, graziers, &c., they number 1,974 male adults. The fifth class, containing 50,955 members, included all persons engaged in industrial occupations, the arts and mechanics, in the manufacture of textile fabrics and dress, or articles of food and drink, as well as dealers in animal, vegetable, and mineral substances. The sixth class contained 76,193 males, including labourers and others (67,752), persons of independent means (18), and persons supported by the community and of no specified occupation (8,423); altogether there are 257,854 males classified by occupation in this district, nearly one-half of whom belonged to the agricultural population.\n\nThe five municipal towns of the district contain an aggregate population of 121,168 souls, and besides these there are only four other towns having a population exceeding 5,000, viz., Jalalabad, Tappal, Murshidabad, and Bijaigarh, aggregating 251,538 souls, giving a total town population of 146,321. But in all these towns there is a proportion of inhabitants who live by cultivation, and, roughly speaking,\nthe five municipal towns may be said to contain all the non-agricultural population of the district, and the cultivators who live in the municipal town may be set off against the few artisans and other non-agriculturists of the rural towns. Thus the bulk of the population is agricultural; the only manufacture (indigo) is the mere working up of an extensively grown plant, and the only other trade (cotton) is nothing more than a carrying trade of agricultural raw materials.\n\nThe census of 1872 gives the number of enclosures inhabited by Hind\u00fbs at 99,322, whilst Musalmans occupy 14,856, and Christians 18, or a total of 114,196. This shows 58 enclosures to the square mile, and nine persons to each enclosure. The separate houses, their character and distribution, are shown as follows:\n\n| Class of house | Hind\u00fbs | Musalmans | Christians | Total | Number of inhabitants |\n|----------------|--------|-----------|------------|-------|-----------------------|\n| Built with skilled labour | ... | 21,598 | 2,876 | 16 | 24,480 | 121,963 |\n| Ditto unskilled labour | ... | 165,770 | 21,249 | 7 | 187,026 | 951,145 |\n| Total | ... | 187,368 | 24,125 | 33 | 211,446 | 1,072,108 |\n\nThis return gives 107 houses to the square mile, and five inhabitants to each house. The proportion of persons inhabiting the better class of houses in the total population is only 11-3 per cent., whilst the divisional average is 10-2 per cent., showing a low standard of comfort in this division, which, however, ranks second in the province in this respect.\n\nThe district, and especially the northern half, abounds in the remains of old forts; few of them, however, have any claims to any antiquity, and the greater number owe their origin to the necessity that was felt for a means of defence against the lawless bands who overran the Du\u00e2b towards the end of last century. Many of the old Rajp\u00fbt forts were improved and strengthened by their successive owners. H\u00e1thras was built of brick by the J\u00e2t Raja, and nearly every respectable landholder constructed a mud fort into which he could retire at the approach of danger. Even for some years after the British occupation fort-building was the daily occupation of all the more powerful talukad\u00e2rs; and that they succeeded in their own unscientific way in turning out something formidable is shown by the story of S\u00e1sni, Kachaura, and Bijaigarh, which were not taken until after great loss in 1802. Mau, Murs\u00e1n, and Luts\u00e1n in tahsil H\u00e1thras, Morthal in Koil, Tappal, Chandaus, Pis\u00e2wa, Besw\u00e2n, Gorai, Deori, Chharra, Barla, and Atrauli must all have been\nplaces of considerable strength, sufficient to withstand any attacks of native troops, and only to be attempted by Europeans when well led and skilfully handled.\n\nPassing from the people and their houses to the customs that prevail amongst them we find that \"panch\u00e1yats are chiefly resorted to by the lower castes, with whom these meetings appear to be a kind of promiscuous assembly of as many of the caste brotherhood as can be got together, to discuss the business in hand, whatever it may be.\" Breaches of caste rules and matrimonial affairs are the most usual subjects of discussion. In nearly all low castes, widows are re-married to the deceased husband's brother, and this observation applies to Jats and Ahirs, though they can hardly be called low castes. Panch\u00e1yats also arrange divorces and re-marriages of divorced women. Their procedure is untrammelled by any system of rules, and, so far as can be ascertained, even the decision of a majority is not binding. Indeed it is not easy to say how they arrive at their conclusions. Nearly all trades and bodies of artisans have chaudhris. Here, again, it is not easy to say how these men come to enjoy the office. In some cases it is admittedly hereditary. In others it seems to depend on a kind of scramble; the man with most vigour and audacity being recognized as chaudhri, to the exclusion perhaps of the last chaudhri's heir. In no case does it appear that election is in use by the trades-people themselves, and in a case where election was suggested by the authorities as the best means of settling an inveterate dispute, although a formal majority was obtained, the dispute raged with as much vigour as ever.\"\n\nAligarh was one of the districts selected and placed by Mr. Thomason under Mr. H. S. Reid for experimental schools. Schools were opened at each of the eight tahsillis in 1850-51. In 1845 the number of Persian and Arabic schools was 159, attended by 1,432 pupils, and the number of Hindi schools amounted to 137, attended by 1,473 pupils\u2014total, 2,905, of whom 682 were Musalm\u00e1ns and 2,223 were Hind\u00fas. The percentage of male children at school to the number fit for school in 1845 was 4\u00b77 per cent. In 1851 the number of schools had increased to 548, and the pupils to 4,948, of whom 3,882 were Hind\u00fas. At the same time there were eight tahsil schools with 366 pupils, and three Anglo-veracular schools with 21 pupils. The halkahbandi or village schools were opened in 1853. The zila school was opened in 1858; the new school-house was built, partly by subscription, in 1870, and has a master's residence and boarding-house attached, to the support of which grants-in-aid are made by the Koil and H\u00e1thras Municipalities. The Anglo-veracular schools are placed at H\u00e1thras, Sikandra Rao, and Atrauli, and are kept up by local contributions and municipal grants.\n\nThe female normal school was opened in 1867, and is under the charge of the Inspectress of Girls' Schools, whose salary is charged to the establishment.

The following statement gives the educational statistics of the district for the years 1860-61 and 1871-72, from the records of the Education Department.\n\n| Class of School | 1860-61 | 1871-72 |\n|-----------------|---------|---------|\n|                 | No. of schools | No. of pupils | Rs. | No. of schools | No. of pupils | Rs. | Average daily attendance | Cost per head | Proportion borne by State | Total charges |\n| Zila (superior) | 1       | 83      | 1,721 | 1       | 146     | 17   | 137                      | 78           | 15                       | 45            | 12,833        |\n| Tahsil          | 8       | 889     | 9,467 | 6       | 580     | 105  | 524                      | 4            | 3                        | 6             | 2,630         |\n| Halkahbandi     | 100     | 1,258   | 4,104 | 95      | 8,450   | 308  | 2,745                    | 3            | 8                        | ...           | 11,778        |\n| Female          | ...     | ...     | ...   | 42      | 625     | 36   | 440                      | 4            | 4                        | 1             | 2,904         |\n| Aided           | ...     | ...     | ...   | 3       | 319     | 39   | 184                      | 40           | 0                        | 16            | 5,941         |\n| United, Indigenous | 268    | 3,084   | 14,857| 229     | 1,799   | 670  | 2,669                    | 6            | 0                        | ...           | 14,538        |\n| Normal (female) | ...     | ...     | ...   | 1       | 20      | ...  | 13                       | 302          | 5                        | 309           | 4,534         |\n| Total           | 497     | 4,984   | 93,149| 370     | 6,766   | 1,175| 6,462                    | ...          | ...                      | ...           | 84,264        |\n\nAn attempt was made during the census of 1872 to collect statistics in regard to the state of education amongst the people. The following statement shows the results,\u2014the number of Hind\u00fas and Musalm\u00e1ns who can read and write (literate), and the percentages of the same to the total population of the same religion, sex and age. The Christian population is so small that the statistics referring to them have been omitted:\n\n| Ages | Hind\u00fas | Males | Females | Musalm\u00e1ns | Males | Females |\n|------|--------|-------|---------|-----------|-------|---------|\n|      | Number | Literate | Percentage | Number | Literate | Percentage |\n| 1 to 12 | 182,416 | 2,888 | 1\u00b75 | 152,186 | 4 | 21,863 | 369 | 1\u00b77 |\n| 13 to 20 | 87,866 | 4,169 | 4\u00b77 | 70,660 | Nil | 10,469 | 614 | 3\u00b79 |\n| Above 20 | 245,279 | 14,616 | 5\u00b79 | 216,714 | ... | 29,884 | 1,881 | 4\u00b74 |\n| Total | 515,561 | 21,703 | 4\u00b72 | 439,560 | 4 | 61,656 | 2,116 | 3\u00b74 |\n\nThese statistics must be very imperfect, for the girls' schools mentioned above must have turned out more than five pupils able to read and write. The educational statistics also show a total of 7,941 boys attending school in the district, without counting those privately educated, whilst the census shows only 7,840 males up to 20 years of age as able to read and write. Few remain at school after they\nhave passed 18 years of age, so that these returns palpably under-estimate the number of literate persons in the district. The census shows 102,807 males between 6 and 15; and taking two-thirds of those between 15 and 20, we have 138,597 males of a school-going age. Comparing these figures with the school returns, we find only about one boy in every seventeen attending school, whilst there is but one school for every 374 boys. This much may at least be gathered, that there is much room for the extension of the lower class or village schools.\n\nThe Aligarh Institute and Scientific Society, founded in 1864 by Sayyid Ahmad Khan, C.S.I., at present Judge of the Small Court at Benares, is thus described by Mr. Smith:\u2014\u201cThe main design of the society was an ambitious one,\u2014it was an endeavour to bring to the knowledge of the general native public the more important results of modern science and historical investigation by means of translations into the vernacular from works in English or other European languages. This design has been steadily kept in view, and during the last nine years various translations have issued from the Society\u2019s Press. Some histories, treatises on farming, on electricity and on political economy, and many of Todhunter\u2019s elementary as well as more advanced mathematical works, have opened out a new course of possible study to the native who knows no language but his own. A captions critic might find objections in some cases to the books selected for translation; but when the end aimed at is so good, and the obvious difficulties in the way are so numerous, it is scarcely fair to criticize with severity. Defects in execution there must be, and these are chiefly due to the want of a European supervisor, who should not only be possessed of considerable scientific attainments, but should have a perfect knowledge of both English and Urdu. Such a man is not easy to obtain, nor could the Society afford the price of his services. The Institute boasts of a library of more than 2,000 volumes, and in the building is a public reading room furnished with the leading English and vernacular papers. In connection with the society, a newspaper called the Aligarh Institute Gazette is published. Part of its contents are printed in Urdu alone, part in English, and a portion also in both languages. It consists largely of extracts from the English papers, but general subjects of social or political interest are frequently discussed in its columns, and the moderation of its tone is attested by the fact that Government is a large subscriber for copies of the paper for use in its various schools.\u201d The \u2018Tahzib-ul-Akhlaq,\u2019 or \u2018Muhammadan Social Reformer,\u2019 is also printed here, but is published at Benares. Thakur Giri Parshad of Benares publishes a paper called the Mangal Samachar.\n\nThe language of the peasantry is very pure Hindi, which, in the southern parganahs, is strongly tinged with the Braj dialect of Muttra; but the language used by the better classes is the Urdu of Delhi. There is only a very small congregation of Native Christians,\nand there is no Brahmo Sam\u00e1j. The religion of Isl\u00e1m is not believed to be making much progress amongst the people, nor is the Wah\u00e1bi movement popular. It must, however, be admitted that the teaching of the more zealous amongst the Aligarh Musalm\u00e1ns has had the effect of inducing all classes of Muhammadans to adopt stricter views of their religion, and to be disposed to abandon many of the customs and observances which Indian Muhammadans have borrowed from their Hind\u00fa neighbours, or which remained untouched with their conversion to Isl\u00e1m. On the one hand, the zealous and bigoted, who form the mass of the population, hold that the Kur\u00e1n claims political supremacy for the religion of Isl\u00e1m. On the other hand, the most eminent, most learned, and most intelligent of the Musalm\u00e1ns deny that this claim of political supremacy is of the essence of Isl\u00e1m, and strongly assert the duty of loyalty to the sovereign, of whatever faith, who permits the free exercise of their religious rites to Muhammadans. As might be expected from its proximity to Delhi, there has been much Muslim colonization and conversion in this district. Converted Badg\u00edjars and Chauh\u00e1ns hold large estates near the Bulandshahr border; and in connection with the Puritan movement amongst the Musalm\u00e1ns, it may be mentioned that these talukad\u00e1rs have dropped the Hind\u00fa title of Th\u00e1kur which they formerly used, though the word has no necessary connection with Hind\u00fa superstition of any kind. Some few J\u00e1ts have embraced Isl\u00e1m in the southern portion of the district, but no family of any note. Indeed there are few Hindu castes that have not given some of its members as converts to the Muhammadan religion.\n\nPrevious to 1846 there was no district d\u00e1k; the letters from police-stations were brought to the Court, by the post when practicable, and in other cases by policemen. In 1846 a district post was organized, and defrayed by a cess from the landholders known as dak\u00e1na.\n\nThe statistics for the years 1846-47 to 1851-52 were as follow:\n\n| Year | Amount realized from talukad\u00e1rs | Cost of establishment | Number of private letters | Amount of postage |\n|------|---------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|------------------|\n|      | Rs.                             | Rs.                   | Posted at police-stations | Posted at Sad-r-\u00e1de, |\n|      |                                 |                       | Received at police-stations | Received at Sad-r-\u00e1de, |\n|      |                                 |                       | Total                    | Total            |\n| 1846-47 | 1,599                           | 1,599                 | 2,258                    | 3,457            |\n| 1847-48 | 1,560                           | 1,567                 | 3,542                    | 4,383            |\n| 1848-49 | 1,596                           | 1,592                 | 3,163                    | 5,225            |\n| 1849-50 | 1,516                           | 1,563                 | 7,250                    | 6,017            |\n| 1850-51 | 1,648                           | 1,635                 | 8,696                    | 7,041            |\n| 1851-52 | 1,656                           | 1,643                 | 9,605                    | 8,598            |\n| 1852-53 | 1,793                           | 1,710                 | 10,129                   | 9,308            |\n| Total | 11,093                          | 11,098                | 24,558                   | 44,837           |\n\nThe postal charge on private letters was six pie, or half an anna, per tola.\nThe great increase in the number of letters posted and postage received will be seen from the following tables, which comprise the returns of both the district and imperial post-offices. There are fifteen imperial post-offices in the district, viz.,\u2014Aligarh, Akrabad, Atrauli, Besw\u00e1n, D\u00e1don, H\u00e1thras, Harduaganj, Igl\u00e1s, Jal\u00e1l\u00ed, Khair, Murs\u00e1n, S\u00e1sni, Sikandra Rao, Tappal, and Somna. There are fourteen district post-offices, viz.,\u2014Ahan, Bijaiagarh, Barla, Chandaus, Daryapur Gonda, Gangfri, Husain, Jaranli, Jaw\u00e1, J\u00e1t\u00e1ri, Sal\u00edmpur, and Aksoli.\n\n| Year | Miscellaneous receipts, fines, Rs. | Passengers and parcels, Rs. | Deposits, guarantee funds, family funds, Rs. | Remittances, Rs. | Postage, Rs. | Total receipts, Rs. | Charges for land rent, etc., Rs. | Charges for transport, Rs. | Mail services, Rs. | Remittances, Rs. | Other charges, refunds, advances, printing, Rs. | Cash balance, Rs. | Total charges, Rs. |\n|------|----------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------|--------------|-------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------|----------------|-----------------|---------------------------------|-----------------|----------------|\n|      |                                  |                           |                                             |                 |              |                   |                               |                       |               |                 |                                 |                 |                |\n| 1861-62 | 9,611                           | 21,189                     | 797                                          | 2,84,931        | 14,014       | 3,70,849          | 18,545                        | 2,64,576            | 50,044         | 649,283          | 8,34,097           |                 |                |\n| 1865-66 | 408                             | 164                        | ...                                          | 82,448          | 16,171       | 99,191            | 19,050                        | 56,613              | 23,249         | 1,183            | 99,190             |                 |                |\n| 1870-71 | 865                             | ...                        | 572                                          | 61,513          | 13,668       | 75,835            | 50,812                        | 19,714              | 14,832         | 10,840           | 150                | 76,338           |                |\n\nIn addition to the above, the receipts in 1860-61 from staging bungalows amounted to Rs. 4,670, and the expenditure to Rs. 1,422; the receipts for service postage to Rs. 14,301, and the expenditure to the same amount, making a total receipt of Rs. 3,49,820.

There were only forty prisoners in 1805, but yet this temporary jail was insufficient for their accommodation. In 1810 the criminal jail was built, and in 1816 the first civil\njail and hospital. In 1806 the duty of guarding the prisoners at work was given to a corps of peons, and from 1817 to 1831 the jail guards were supplied from the Agra Provincial Battalion. In the latter year special guards were entertained. The jail administration is now conducted under Act XXVI. of 1870. The jail statistics for five years previous to the mutiny were as follow:\n\n| Year | Aggregate number of prisoners during the year | Daily average number of prisoners | Cost of permanent establishment | Cost of contingent guard | Miscellaneous charges | Cost of native medicines | Cost of rations | Cost of clothing and bedding | Cost of additions and repairs | Grand total of expenditure |\n|------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|---------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|\n| 1844 | 255,118                                     | 619                             | 1,394                         | 5,976                    | 6,781                 | 1,714                  | 231           | 11,997                     | 1,274                       | 318                       | 26,885                   |\n| 1845 | 274,159                                     | 641                             | 1,954                         | 5,976                    | 5,88                   | 1,968                  | 309           | 9,556                      | 1,117                       | 846                       | 25,701                   |\n| 1846 | 286,280                                     | 659                             | 1,176                         | 5,976                    | 4,83                   | 1,277                  | 190           | 8,832                      | 1,391                       | 4,599                     | 28,784                   |\n| 1847 | 253,851                                     | 695                             | 1,808                         | 4,717                    | 4,779                 | 778                    | 84            | 8,069                      | 39                          | 86                        | 20,714                   |\n| 1848 | 225,628                                     | 609                             | 2,124                         | 5,871                    | 4,138                 | 831                    | 76            | 7,660                      | 345                         | 191                       | 21,542                   |\n\nThe following table gives the average cost per head per annum of the main items of expenditure, except rations, which gives the daily cost per head:\n\n| Year | Average cost of permanent guard | Contingent guard | Rations per diem | Clothing | Total cost | Total cost, exclusive of additions and repairs | Total cost, exclusive of permanent establishment and repairs |\n|------|--------------------------------|------------------|------------------|----------|------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|\n|      | Rs. a. p.                       | Rs. a. p.        | Rs. a. p.        | Rs. a. p.| Rs. a. p.  | Rs. a. p.                                        | Rs. a. p.                                                   |\n| 1844 | 8 6 9                           | 9 11 2           | 61               | 15 13 11| 41 5 3    | 40 2 54                                         | 30 5 3                                                      |\n| 1845 | 9 5 2                           | 8 3 0            | 78               | 14 14 5 | 3 4 1     | 10 1 6                                          | 30 3 103                                                    |\n| 1846 | 9 9 7                           | 7 6 7            | 74               | 18 10 1 | 0 9 0     | 43 8 6                                          | 26 4 118                                                    |\n| 1847 | 6 12 7                          | 6 14 0           | 6                | 11 9 6  | 29 15 10  | 29 10 10                                        | 20 4 8                                                      |\n| 1848 | 9 10 8                          | 6 12 8           | 61               | 12 9 1  | 0 9 8     | 35 6 7                                          | 34 8 11                                                     |\n\nThe later statistics of the Aligarh Jail are as follow:\u2014The average number of prisoners in jail in 1850 was 562, in 1860 was 481, and in 1870 was 470; the ratio per cent. of this average number to the population, as shown in the census of 1865 (925,538), was in 1850, '067; in 1860, '056; in 1870, '051. The number of prisoners\nadmitted in 1860 was 1,660, and in 1870 was 1,260, of whom 26 were females. The number of persons discharged in 1870 was 733. In 1870, there were 314 admissions into hospital, giving a ratio of admissions to average strength of 66:98; 4 patients died, or '85 of the average strength. The cost per prisoner per annum in 1870 was for rations Rs. 18-2-1; clothing, Rs. 2-14-3; fixed establishment, Rs. 6-11-3; contingent guards, Rs. 3-7-10; police guards, Rs. 2-4-9; and additions and repairs, Rs. 12-6-0, or a total of Rs. 45-14-2. The total manufactures during the same year amounted to Rs. 2,437, and the average earnings of each prisoner to Rs. 5-3. In 1870 the Muhammadan prisoners numbered 165, and the Hind\u00fa 499; there were 17 prisoners under 16 years of age, 879 between 16 and 40, 123 between 40 and 60, and 22 above 60. The occupations of the majority of the male prisoners were\u2014agriculturists, 402, labourers, 319, and domestic servants, 153.\n\nIn the year 1804 Government undertook the police duties in all large towns, and intrusted the interior police to the tahsild\u00e1rs, who were remunerated by a fee of one-half per cent. on the collections. Regulation XIV. of 1807 relieved the tahsild\u00e1rs of all police duties, and ordered the establishment of regular th\u00e1n\u00e1s or police-stations, which was carried out in 1809, when thirty-eight stations were formed in what then constituted the Aligarh district, employing 1,187 officers and men, at a yearly cost of Rs. 78,696.\u00b9\n\nThe attention of the Magistrate was early directed towards the suppression of the crime of kaz\u00e1ki, or robbery by mounted highwaymen, which in those days assumed such proportions that, as a matter of fact and not a figure of speech, the highways were unoccupied, and the travellers walked through bye-ways. The facility of escape into the Begam Sumr\u00fa's territories, the protection afforded by the heavy jungles and numerous forts which then studded the country, and the ready sale for plundered property, contributed to foster this crime, which probably had its origin in the recent disbandment of the Marhatta forces, by which hundreds of mercenary adventurers were left to their own resources. In 1806, the Magistrate reported to Government that the kaz\u00e1ks had become so daring as to rob and plunder travellers in the extensive plains near the town of Koil, and that he had as a matter of necessity entertained fifty horsemen for the protection of the roads. Government immediately sanctioned this establishment, and when, in 1809, it was found that still more vigorous measures were required for the suppression of kaz\u00e1ki, and also of thagi and d\u00e1k\u00e1ti which had begun to prevail\n\n\u00b9 The cost of police under the first system amounted to Rs. 91,020, viz., tahsild\u00e1r's commission, Rs. 21,756; sadr kotw\u00e1l\u00ed establishment, Rs. 16,560; and police of towns under Regulation XXXV., 1808, and XXI., 1806, Rs. 52,704. These figures and facts are taken chiefly from Hutchinson's Aligarh Statistics.\nin these provinces, orders were issued to Colonel Gardner to raise a corps of irregular cavalry for the support of the police and for other local purposes. Next year Regulation II. of 1810 was passed, containing very stringent enactments against kazdki, and in the same year the office of superintendent of police was instituted. One of the first steps this officer (Mr. Guthrie) took, was to establish a horse patrol of one hundred and forty-five sawars from Colonel Gardner's corps, for the protection of the roads in this district. In 1812, he placed subordinate stations of footmen to co-operate with the horse patrols in the suppression of crime along the high roads, but, even after the adoption of these measures, the roads were so insecure that it was the practice of passengers to travel in company, and to be conveyed from station to station by parties of the patrols. Colonel Gardner's exertions for the suppression of kazdki were completely successful for in a short time, many of the kazdks surrendered to him and were pardoned at his recommendation, on giving security for future good conduct. Not content with arresting the offenders themselves, he struck at those who sheltered them, and denounced Thakur Hira Singh, talukadar of Awa Misa in the Muttra district, as a notorious harbourer of these criminals and participant in their spoils.\n\nThe Magistrate was ordered by Government to inquire into the conduct of Raja of Awa Misa, chief Hira Singh; but as no positive proof was elicited against him, the matter was allowed to drop. In 1815 Colonel Gardner's corps was removed for military service, and was replaced in its police duties by a small party of irregular cavalry, and by a detachment of 50 men from Major Lumsdaine's dromedary corps. The dromedaries were found to be of little use for patrolling, and in 1817 the Magistrate was authorised to entertain a local force, numbering 78 men, at a monthly cost of Rs. 1,615. In the meantime, whilst kazdki was being put down with a strong hand, every other description of crime was committed almost with impunity. On the 23rd February, 1809, the Magistrate (Mr. Ross) reported to Government that since the 12th of the preceding month, three daks had been robbed not far from Koil; since the commencement of the year, 40 cases had occurred of robbery, 24 of house-breaking, and 81 of thefts of magnitude; in all which crimes 684 persons were concerned, of whom only 70 were apprehended. The old system of police had been abolished, and no other had been introduced in its stead. The tahsildars, in name at least, still continued in charge of the police, but relieved of all responsibility, and knowing that even the work of supervision would remain but a short time in their hands, they cared little for the suppression of crime, and their efforts to preserve the public peace were guided and directed by the influence which such proceedings would have on the collection of the public revenue. The punctual discharge of the duty of the office of collector of the revenue was found more profitable than any other, and consequently more\nattention was paid to it than to the less show duties of the magistrate. Two years later the Magistrate reported that there was an increasing spirit of disobedience amongst the zamindars, who all possessed strongholds which enabled them to defy the officers of police; and that scarcely a process was issued which was not either evaded or openly resisted. In 1814 Ajit Singh, zamindar of Sumera, in Khandauli, plundered a treasure party, wounding two of the chapr\u00e1sis on guard. The Magistrate applied for the assistance of the military, and in the meantime sent the darogahs of Sadabad, Itmadpur, and Khandauli, with 55 footmen, to act against Ajit Singh. The latter attacked them, killed the darogah and jamadar of Khandauli, wounded three footmen, and took the darogah of Itmadpur prisoner. After this he remained unmolested in his fort until a detachment of two companies of the 13th Regiment, with two 6-pounders, was sent against him under Major Maxwell, when he made his escape, and his fort was destroyed.\n\nFor many years this district was the head-quarters of gangs of thugs and dacoits, the extent of whose depredations may be inferred from the following extracts from a report by the Superintendent of Police, dated 30th April, 1816:\u2014\u201cThe most heinous robberies committed in these provinces are perpetrated by gangs of Budhiks and Shughal Khors. These gangs are almost exclusively settled in the district of Aligarh and in that part of the territory of the Naw\u00e1b Vazir bordering the district of Gorakhpur. After much enquiry I am disposed to believe that the Budhiks of Aligarh and the Shughal Khors of Bhar\u00e1ich are connected with each other, and are one and the same people, the name constituting the sole difference. Exclusive of the Shughal Khors established in the country of the Naw\u00e1b Vazir, the following tribes are notorious in the western provinces:\u2014Budhiks, Kanjars, Bhauriyas, Gidhiyas, and Hab\u00faras. All of these subsist by robbery, and are more or less attached to a vagrant life, eating the flesh of jackals, lizards, &c. The Budhiks of Aligarh and the Shughal Khors of Gorakhpur are outcasts of Musalm\u00e1n as well as Hind\u00fa tribes; the majority, however, are Rajputs. Formerly numbers of Budhiks infested different parts of the districts of Aligarh, Et\u00e1wa, Farukhabad, and Agra. At present those residing in the North-West Provinces are settled on the estates of the chieftains of Murs\u00e1n, H\u00e1thras, &c., in Aligarh, and some few in the district of Agra. The gangs generally make excursions once a year, in the prosecution of which they journey several hundred miles. Those in Aligarh have been known to visit Sah\u00e1r\u00e1npur, Hardw\u00e1r, Lucknow, Allahabad, Benares, and Jaipur for the purpose of plunder, and those in Bhar\u00e1ich have visited Chupra in the district of S\u00e1ran, Haz\u00e1r\u00edb\u00e1gh in Ramgarh, and Allahabad. The high roads leading through Et\u00e1wa, Aligarh, and Farukhabad are for the most part the scenes of the atrocities committed by a class of thugs who rob and murder on the highways.\nTo so great an extent did this crime prevail in former years, that during 1808 and 1809 not less than sixty-seven bodies were taken out of wells in the single district of Et\u00e1wa. The gangs composing this class were established and fostered in the estates of Hira Singh of Awa Misa, Bhagwant Singh of Murs\u00e1n, Daya R\u00e1m of H\u00e1thras, and Himmat Singh of Ets. In 1811 a list of sixty-eight persons and several sird\u00e1rs called jamad\u00e1rs, composing these gangs, was given into this office by persons who were induced to deliver themselves up to Colonel Gardner under hopes of pardon. They were all Musalm\u00e1ns, and chiefly of the Mewati tribe.\" The chief gangs of Budhiks quitted these provinces on the fall of H\u00e1thras. The fall of H\u00e1thras and the subsequent establishment of police-stations and outposts in the parganahs of H\u00e1thras, Murs\u00e1n, Awa and Besw\u00e1n effected immediately a reformation in police matters which the Magistrates had hitherto vainly attempted to obtain. The rebellious and disaffected were deprived of their last rallying point, outlaws lost a refuge inaccessible to our police, and the robber gangs no longer had a safe home where they could divide and dispose of their spoils, and from whence they could issue unchecked on their plundering expeditions.\n\nAt present the chief crimes of this district are petty burglaries, thefts, and cattle-stealing. The worst cases of burglary and highway robbery are generally committed by Hab\u00faras, a kind of gipsy tribe, notorious as vagrants and ruffians, and whose sole profession is thieving. These Hab\u00faras infest those parts of the district which border on Muttra and Bulandshahr, and when disturbed in their avocations by a zealous police-officer, they usually cross the boundary into the neighbouring jurisdiction, to return again at a favourable opportunity. In the police circles to the south and east of Koil the tribe of Aberiyas (also called Baheliyas) are the perpetrators of most of the cases of burglary and theft. They are well known as a thieving caste, but they generally conceal their real occupation under the nominal profession of agriculture. Suicides are numerous, especially amongst females; the impelling motive appears generally to be a sudden impulse of passion, or jealousy or revenge, and in some few cases self-destruction is effected from fear of shame or dread of exposure. In 1806 it was found that several instances had occurred of persons killing their children from an impulse of passion, with the intention of revenging themselves for an insult or injury offered to them, under the idea that the guilt of the innocent victim's death would be on the head of the person offering such insult or injury. To put a stop to this practice, a proclamation was issued by the Court of Circuit that persons convicted of so flagrant and cruel an offence would be invariably punished with death. Judging from the records, sati was seldom practised: only twelve cases were recorded from 1815 to its abolition by law in 1829. From 1817 to 1831 the duty of jail, treasury, court and personal guards was performed by sepoys of\nthe Agra Provincial Battalion, which was disbanded in 1831, and from that time to the mutiny the guards were furnished from the native regiments cantoned at Aligarh. The chaukidars or village watchmen are now organised under Act XVI of 1873, and in 1873 numbered 2,000 men, maintained at a cost of Rs. 75,000, and giving one chaukidar to every 485 of the inhabitants. The regular police are enrolled under Act V. of 1861, and during the same year numbered 1,057 men of all ranks, entertained at a cost of Rs. 1,14,210 per annum, of which Rs. 30,184 were chargeable to the provincial revenues. The proportion of police to area is one to 1:75 square miles, and to total population is one to every 1,015 inhabitants. The average number of offences for seventeen years before the mutiny (1836 to 1852), distributed under the heads then adopted, was as follows:\u2014Murder, 7:5; homicide, 7:4; dakaati, 1:1; highway robbery, 8:2; burglary, 541:4; cattle-theft, 88; theft with poisoning from 1843 to 1852, 3; other thefts, 1,013:4; affrays, 7:2; assault with wounding, 40; arson, 2; rape, 1; receiving stolen property, 13; attempts and other offences, 1,081. The average value of property stolen from 1843 to 1852 was Rs. 25,905, and of property recovered was Rs. 5,028, showing only 19:5 per cent. of recoveries. The average number of cases during the same ten years was 512, concerning 925 persons, of which 43 cases and 109 persons were committed, and 364 cases and 917 persons were acquitted. The percentage of convictions for the ten years is 60:09. The following statement shows the crime statistics and the results of police action for seven years after the mutiny:\n\n| Year | Cases cognizable by the Police | Value of property | Cases | Persons |\n|------|-------------------------------|------------------|-------|---------|\n|      | Murder | Dakaati | Highway Robbery | Burglary | Theft | Stolen | Recovered | Total cognizable | Under inquiry | Presented to conviction | Brought to trial | Convicted and committed | Acquitted | Proportion of convictions to persons tried |\n| 1865 | 6     | 15     | 765             | 1,281  | 23,058 | 4,901 | 2,404   | 610           | 518           | 705           | 450           | 800         | 57:6       |\n| 1866 | 5     | 11     | 742             | 955    | 23,286 | 5,905 | 2,898   | 1,901         | 598           | 1,558         | 1,425         | 169         | 85:7       |\n| 1867 | 5     | 11     | 742             | 955    | 23,286 | 5,905 | 2,898   | 1,901         | 598           | 1,558         | 1,425         | 169         | 85:7       |\n| 1868 | 10    | 10     | 528             | 451    | 22,945 | 7,551 | 2,114   | 1,176         | 506           | 3,146         | 968          | 193         | 88:1       |\n| 1869 | 3     | 13     | 899             | 724    | 23,756 | 8,586 | 1,996   | 1,083         | 507           | 1,140         | 95           | 901         | 88:4       |\n| 1870 | 12    | 11     | 1,047           | 731    | 80,177 | 11,685 | 2,241   | 2,085         | 544           | 1,427         | 1,151         | 249         | 87:66      |\n| 1871 | 11    | 217    | 924             | 718    | 27,904 | 23,524 | 2,112   | 1,998         | 629           | 1,541         | 1,148         | 148         | 74:17      |\n\nThe administration comes out well of late years in serious cases against the person; but in heinous cases against person and property, or property alone,\nthe police here, as in the greater part of the Meerut division, have comparatively failed to render that security to the persons and property of travellers which one should expect in a well-governed British district. The junction of the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway with the East Indian line at Aligarh has led to an influx of travellers, who are the prey of regularly organized bands of plunderers.\n\nThe first-class police-stations in the district are Khair, Igles, H\u00e1thras, S\u00e1ni, Sikandra R\u00e1o, Akrabad, Atrauli, Dadon, Jaw\u00e1, Aligarh, and Hardanganj. The second-class police-stations are Tappal, Gonda, Nar\u00e1yanpur, Murs\u00e1n, Husain, Agsoli, S\u00e1nkora, Barla, Gang\u00edri, Somna, and Chandaus. The third-class stations are Hastpur, Mit\u00e1i, Hat\u00edsa, Alam, Gopi, J\u00e1o, Chherat, Panehti, Madr\u00e1k, Bh\u00e1nkri, junction of roads from S\u00e1ni to Jalesar and from H\u00e1thras to K\u00e1sganj.\n\nOrders were issued under the Infanticide Act (VIII. of 1870) at an early period in Aligarh, and the result at first was much difference of opinion. The Magistrate reported that he did not think that the crime prevailed to any extent in this district; but he sent up a list of 127 villages, and another of certain clans in which the percentage of female minors on the total minor population fell below 40 per cent., the standard then in force. The statistics, however, were incomplete, and further information was called for. A special census was taken in the cold weather of 1871-72, and on this basis, as all Rajp\u00fats in the district had already been proclaimed, the Pand\u00edr, J\u00e1don, and Chanh\u00e1n tribes were brought under the rules from the beginning of 1872 in 85 villages where the minor population exceeded 25 souls with less than 40 per cent. of girls. The total population of the proclaimed villages was then 9,657, with 2,253 boys and 1,146 girls. On receipt of the census statistics of 1872, and orders lowering the standard of exemption to 35 per cent., 54 villages were removed from supervision by the police, whilst inquiries were directed to be held in regard to the Rajp\u00fat, J\u00e1t, Ahir and Banj\u00e1ra villages in which, from the census statistics, it appeared that there was reason to believe that the practice still continued. The result of these inquiries was that 37 villages were exempted. There are now 85 villages on the proclaimed list\u201412 J\u00e1don villages, 14 Chanh\u00e1n, 8 Pand\u00edr, 1 Gahlot, 1 Solankhi, 1 Badg\u00fajar, 25 J\u00e1t, 22 Ahir, and 1 G\u00fajar village.\n\nAfter the conquest in 1803, the first settlement of the Firozabad division of the conquered provinces was made by Mr. R. Cunynghame of Et\u00e1wa for 1211 fa\u0161li (1803-04) almost entirely with farmers. Parganahs Mah\u00e1b\u00e1n, M\u00e1t, Sonai, R\u00e1ya, Sahpu, Hasangarh, and talukas K\u00e1ras and Jo\u00e1r were farmed by Raja Daya R\u00e1m of H\u00e1thras and Raja Bhagwant Singh of Murs\u00e1n, besides their ancestral lands of H\u00e1thras and Murs\u00e1n. Sadabad and Khandauli were given in farm to one Puran Chand,\nand B\u0101h Pan\u0101hat to Brijbasi L\u0101l. F\u012bruzabad and Jalesar were held am\u0101ni, the am\u0101nis appointed to settle and collect the revenue receiving ten per cent. on the collections. The Koil parganahs also under Mr. C. Russell were chiefly settled on the am\u0101ni system. Owing to the disturbed condition of the district, assessments could only be made on an estimate of the crops, as they stood, or those of the preceding years were accepted. The parganahs of Khair, Noh Jhil, and Malikpur were farmed to obtain the farmer's assistance in restoring them to order, and parganahs Shikarpur, Pitampur, and Barauli were then held in open rebellion by D\u016bndi Khan.\n\nIn October, 1804, instructions were issued for the new settlement. Lands Settlement of 1213 fa\u1e63li, were to be leased at a fair assessment by a comparison of the rent-roll of each village for some years back, and in all cases possible, the village proprietors were to be admitted to engagements and encouraged by easy assessments. Nank\u0101r allowances not exceeding ten per cent. were to be deducted from the land-revenue, and engagements were to be taken for the remainder under Regulation VIII. of 1793. If subordinate proprietors existed in a taluka, the settlement was to be made with them, and in any case with the parties in possession. The troubled state of the district, however, rendered it advisable to continue the practice of giving most of the parganahs in farm to the more powerful talukadars. The Rajas of H\u0101thras and Mur\u0101n were confirmed in their farms with the addition of Sadabad and Khandauli, and B\u0101h Pan\u0101hat was given in farm to Sheonandan Dichit, the agent of the Bhadauriya Raja. Mr. J. R. Hutchinson gives the assessment of 1803-04 at Rs. 18,19,250, and that of 1804-05 at Rs. 19,86,483. Although these assessments were fixed on a comparatively moderate estimate of the rental assets, not much more than three-fourths of the demand were realized; and remissions to the extent of Rs. 9,78,440 were granted for both years. This was necessary from losses caused by drought, hailstorms, and war. D\u016bndi Kh\u0101n was in rebellion and plundered the parganahs now forming the Bulandshahr district; Holkar and Amir Kh\u0101n made irruptions into the Du\u0101b, and the Banj\u0101ras carrying supplies to the English army at Bharatpur and Muttra devastated the country through which they passed. The drought of 1803-04 is still remembered as having been very severely felt in the Upper Du\u0101b.\n\nThe Government attempted to relieve the cultivators by a system of advances, Triennial settlement, but this soon became a source of emolument to the native officials instead of a privilege to the landholders, so that on inquiry being made much of it had to be remitted. Regulation IX. of 1805 gave instructions for a triennial settlement, 1213 to 1215 fa\u1e63li (1805-06 to 1807-08), at the expiration of which another settlement for a similar term was to be concluded with all those willing to engage. After 1218 fa\u1e63li a new\n\n---\n\n1 The charges for collection amounted to Rs. 1,66,279 and Rs. 1,95,445 respectively.\nsettlement was to be concluded with the same persons for a further term of four years (1811-12 to 1814-15), the assessment being formed by adding to the annual revenue of the second three years, three-fourths of the net increase of revenue during one year of that period. At the same time the following instructions\\(^1\\) were issued to the Collectors:\u2014\"In those instances in which the land-revenue assessed on the lands in the Ceded Provinces under the late settlement has been proved to be too heavy, adequate deductions must necessarily be granted in fixing the land-revenue of 1213 \\(f\\)asli; but it will be the duty of the Collectors, in all practicable cases, to restore the land-revenue of 1212 by a progressive assessment previously to the expiration of the approaching settlement. The Governor-General in Council does not however consider it to be proper to rescind his orders of the 22nd of April, for the conclusion of a settlement on the land-revenue of 1212 \\(f\\)asli with those landholders and farmers who have fulfilled their engagements, although some loss may be sustained by Government in the adjustment of the land-revenue of those lands which have been too highly assessed. It is of the utmost importance, with reference to the improvement of the resources of the country, that the assessment should in all cases be moderate, and the temporary diminution of the public revenue which may result from the principles on which the approaching settlement is to be made will be amply compensated by the confidence they will inspire in the moderation of the British Government, and by the encouragement which will be afforded to the improvement of the lands, and by the increasing prosperity of our subjects of every description in the Ceded Provinces.\" Though orders had repeatedly issued for the settlement with the village proprietors, Mr. C. Russell in the Koil parganahs continued the great farms: The Rajas of H\u00e1thras and Murs\u00e1n, and Harkishan Singh of Besw\u00e1n, were confirmed as farmers; Dib\u00e1i was given to Th\u00e1kur Mard\u00e1n Ali Kh\u00e1n; Malakpur to Akbar Ali Kh\u00e1n; Noh Jhil, Khair, Pitampur, and Shik\u00e1pur were settled with Hanmast Kh\u00e1n, the son of the rebel leader D\u00fandi Kh\u00e1n; while Chand\u00e1s was leased to Puran Chand, a banker of Mah\u00e1b\u00e1n. Mr. Russell considered that it was necessary to conciliate the principal land-owners at any cost, without bestowing any attention on the rights of the village proprietors, who were left to their mercies.\n\nThat the difficulties connected with the settlement of the land-revenue with the actual proprietors of the land were real is shown by the following letter\\(^2\\) from the Collector:\u2014\"In the column specifying the names of the farmers, the Board will observe that Raja Daya R\u00e1m holds the principal farms in this district. The parganahs which compose them,\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Extract from Board's Proceedings, No. 25, of June 14th, 1805.  \n\\(^2\\) Ibid., No. 17, dated July 29th, 1806, containing a letter from Collector of Aligarh; see also Board's Records, 2nd October, 1805, No. 1; and 21st January, 1806, Nos. 5-6.\nwith the exception of Khandauli, were placed under his superintendence by Lord Lake immediately after the conquest of these provinces, and they were continued to him by the late Acting Collector of the Firuzabad division in that year, with the approbation of His Lordship. In the last year the same arrangement was directed by His Lordship, and the parganah of Khandauli was added to his farm by the Acting Collector, with the concurrence of His Lordship, as he had in vain attempted to realize the collections or to preserve tranquillity and good order by the appointment of a tahsildar. From the same causes, and under similar circumstances, the parganah of Sadabad was also given in farm to Raja Bhagwant Singh in that year, as the refractory and violent spirit of the zamindars set the authority of the tahsildar at defiance. The farm of Noh Jhil and Khair the Board are already informed to have been granted to Ranmast Khan, the son of Dundi Khan, according to the conditional offer of pardon to the latter by the Right Hon'ble Lord Lake, and any observations upon this point are unnecessary.\n\n\"Independent of these places, there are only three small farms, of Chandaus, a part of Dibai, and of Ahar Malikpur. The former has been farmed, as I could not procure any adequate security for the collections upon the tahsilidari system upon the percentage of Government, owing to the mutinous habits and character of the zamindars, and their not being able to produce any securities. Dibai was originally under a tahsildar, but in consequence of the separation of the taluka Gangapur, the remainder was given in farm to Mardan Ali Khan, in consideration of the attachment and fidelity he had manifested to the British interests. The zamindar of Gangapur had been in rebellion against the Government. He was pardoned by the Right Hon'ble Lord Lake, and his lands being restored to him, his revenues are paid into the head treasury. The same circumstances apply with respect to Ahar Malikpur, from which parganah the three talukas of Jadani, of Payama, and of Sonai, have been separated in the present settlement, and the collections of them are payable at the head treasury. The remaining villages are farmed by Akbar Ali Khan, the person who held them in farm in the past year. Under the head of amdani are included the istimadari tenures of Yahiya Khan of Karoli and of Maloi, and Muhammad Kadir Baksh of Jhajhar, upon which subjects I have already had the honour to address the Board. The towns of Koil and of Khurja, which have always been held khils, are also included in it, as likewise one or two small disputed mukarari tenures, and two or three different talukas (some villages of which have been separated and granted in jagir by the Right Hon'ble Lord Lake to individuals, and no engagements yet entered into for the remainder), as well as a few other villages which are at present held khils. The zamindari lands of Ranmast Khan are also included, until he may think proper to conclude a final settlement.\"\nAnother of Mr. Russell's letters shows his opinions on the tenure question. In replying to objections raised by certain village proprietors against the grant of their lands in j\u0101g\u012br to one Gop\u00e1l Kishan, he writes in the following terms:\u2014\"Any objections of the zam\u012bnd\u0101rs upon occasions of j\u0101g\u012br are erroneously founded; their rights are preserved and secured to them, and any oppressive grievances can be redressed by law. The right of soil, indeed, rested formerly solely and exclusively with the king, and not with the immediate landholders. I am not aware, therefore, of any obstacle to Government granting in j\u0101g\u012br any lands which they may think proper in this country, nor can the objections of the zam\u012bnd\u0101rs be considered valid.\" The Board in reply stated that they did not concur in the Collector's opinion regarding the rights of zam\u012bnd\u0101rs, and declared that the grant of j\u0101g\u012br, except in cases where Government is the actual proprietor of the soil, is objectionable, inasmuch as it tends to affect the rights of individuals.\n\nAlthough the Collector was so unmindful of the interests of the inferior proprietors, he was quite aware of the defective title by which the talukad\u0101rs held their large possessions. In April, 1808, he writes thus to the Board of Commissioners:\u2014\"It is notorious that in the majority of the talukas and the nominal zam\u012bnd\u0101ri estates of our principal landholders, the proprietary right in the soil is not vested in the possessors. A vast proportion of the lands have been successively annexed to their estates from time to time through intrigues and by means of that power and influence which they have possessed. They have taken advantage of the distractions and revolutions which have prevailed, and have in many instances founded their own consequence and authority upon the weakness of the ruling power. The talukad\u0101rs possess pattahs granted under former Governments, in which they are styled zam\u012bnd\u0101rs and talukad\u0101rs, and they attach the validity of regular sanads to them.\" More than forty years after the date of this letter, the claims of the talukad\u0101rs in this district to the absolute proprietary right of the whole of their talukas were finally negatived by the civil courts, as will be seen further on. This settlement was based on a progressive revenue rising from Rs. 23,56,464 in 1218 fa\u0161li to Rs. 24,21,575 in 1219, and Rs. 24,57,253 in 1220. The average number of persons engaging for the land-revenue was only 827, and the average charges for collection amounted to Rs. 2,03,362.\n\nAs Government relinquished all extra cesses, and had forbidden the zam\u012bnd\u0101rs to collect them, deductions were made on this account in the assessment. The sums remitted to some of the chief talukad\u0101rs as compensation for the abolition of transit (rahd\u0101ri), salt and\n\n---\n\n1 Board's Records, 28th June, 1806; Ibid., 22nd October, 1805, No. 1; and 31st January, 1806, Nos. 5, 6.\nbazar (gomi) duties were considerable, amounting in the case of Daya Ram of Hathras\u00b9 to Rs. 20,000 a year, and in the case of Bhagwant Singh of Mursan to Rs. 10,000. Not content with this, Daya Ram claimed an additional remission of Rs. 10,000 a year, on the ground of custom, for 1211 and 1212 fasli. He was then as farmer paying Rs. 3,30,000 per annum as land revenue, and as proprietor Rs. 1,35,000, and put in a letter of the Marhatta General DuBoigne allowing Rs. 10,000 as 'mudfi bamiyib mamul' or 'customary deduction,' and one of Perron's allowing Rs. 16,062 for 1802, and Rs. 10,000 for 1803.\u00b2 This claim was disallowed, but neither he nor the Mursan Raja refrained from collecting the illegal cesses until the fall of Hathras and Mursan. In 1806, the want of rain was much felt. None fell up to the 15th of August, and it was not until the 4th of September that the regular monsoon commenced. Similar complaints were received in 1808, when the rains did not set in until August. The consequence of this was, that remissions amounting to three annas in the rupee were granted to all except the most powerful zamindars. These remissions amounted in 1806 to Rs. 1,88,278 for loss caused by the marching of troops; Rs. 60,980 for damages alleged to have been committed by field mice (miskhori), besides the three annas in the rupee.\u00b3 Mr. Grant, writing in 1806, says, with regard to these remissions\u2074:\u2014\"I am convinced that the intention of Government has been nearly rendered abortive, and that of the considerable remissions which have been authorised in this district, a very small proportion has been granted to the inferior classes of zamindars and ryots, for whose relief I conceive the indulgence of Government to have been intended.\" Besides the remissions of land revenue, large remissions of advances (takkavi) were granted, so that it is not surprising that during the first five years of our rule no sales for arrears of land revenue were necessary.\n\nThe Board of Commissioners, appointed under Regulation X. of 1807, met at Aligarh in December of that year, and issued instructions for a permanent settlement. The Collector stated that, owing to wars and bad seasons, only three-fifths of the culturable land were then under cultivation; that with improved management he expected an increase of eight lakhs of rupees to the revenue in six years; and deprecated the introduction of a permanent settlement. The\n\n\u00b9 Board's Records, 20th June, 1806, No. 17; Ibid 27th June, 1806, Nos. 16\u201420; 26th August, 1806, Nos. 7\u20148; 23rd January, 1807, No. 28. Daya Ram also received compensation for the abolition of the Hathras mint. \u00b2 Board's Records, 22nd April, 1806, No. 5; 23rd January, 1808, No. 28; 24th May, 1808, No. 5; 25th April, 1809, No. 46-53. \u00b3 As to drought, see Board's Records 26th August, 1806, Nos. 7, 8; 26th February, 1808, No. 1; 25th September, 1808, No. 48; and Remissions, 26th February, 1808, No. 1; 23rd September, 1809, No. 34. \u2074 Again, in Board's Records, 16th January, 1809, 40, Collector reports that \"but few of the people have received the benevolent indulgence of Government,\" whereon he was directed in forming the settlement to make further inquiries.\nBoard then directed a settlement with farmers for three years, and with proprietors for a similar term, with a stipulation that the revenue assessed for the last year should remain fixed for ever, in case the zamindars were willing to engage for its payment in perpetuity, subject to the sanction of the Court of Directors. This sanction was, fortunately for the State, never obtained. The Court of Directors were informed of this intention in a despatch dated 31st July, 1807, and again in 1808, and in their reply, dated 27th February, 1810, they express their determination not to proceed immediately to the settlement of the ceded and conquered provinces in perpetuity until all the proceedings regarding the current settlement were before them. In 1811 they disallowed the permanency of the existing settlement, and the conditions laid down in Regulation X., 1807, were rescinded by Regulations IX. and X. of 1812, which again reverted to the declarations contained in the Regulations of 1803 and 1805.\n\nWith this settlement was introduced the system of tahsilis, by which tahsildars received fixed salaries instead of the commission of ten per cent. on the collections formerly given. Mr. Russell was succeeded by Mr. Trant, who carried out the new settlement with the village proprietors of the Matira and eastern parganahs which had been held in farm by Daya Ram, Bhagwant Singh and Harkishan. Mr. E. Elliott joined in December, 1808, and carried out the settlement of the remainder of the district, with the exception of two parganahs. The land revenue of Aligarh in the year 1218, exclusive of the lands formerly held in farm or at a fixed revenue, stood at Rs. 20,74,010, or Rs. 4,00,906 above the land revenue of 1215. The revenue of the resumed farms was fixed at Rs. 8,12,835, and exceeded the revenue paid by the farmers by over three lakhs of rupees, yet the people did not complain, and only rejoiced at being delivered from the oppression of the late farmers. The total revenue of 1216 fauzi (1808-9 A.D.) is given by Mr. Hutchinson at Rs. 26,03,825, of 1217 at Rs. 28,60,661, and of 1218 at Rs. 31,03,793, and the number of persons allowed to engage at 3,324.\n\nThe settlement was too hurried to admit of that scrutiny into the rights of the proprietors which Government desired; and in 1810 Mr. Fortescue, whilst regretting the frequency of sales for arrears, suggested that the separate possession and responsibility of sharers might be attempted, when he believed that fewer sales would occur. The Board, accordingly, instructed Collectors to allow all persons to claim admission to the proprietary right, whether they had previously been admitted to engage for the Government revenue or not. Another cause of distress was\n\n---\n\n1 A full account of the arguments and proceedings in relation to this attempt at a permanent settlement is given in Selections from Revenue Records, N.W.P., 1818-20 : Calcutta, 1866; see page 29.\n2 1st January, 1808.\nthe system of taking security for one-fourth of the revenues from the zam\u00edn-d\u00e1rs, which Mr. H. Newnham thus describes.\u00b9 \"In this district many estates are confessedly in the actual possession of the securities,\u2014in some cases on the strength of the security bond, in others by katkina. Possession of the securities, on whatever grounds, is equally injurious to the landholders and to Government. A process is issued to the landholder, who attends and says he is not in possession; the security is then called upon, who frequently confesses possession, but complains of loss, claims a settlement of accounts, and advances a variety of private engagements and pecuniary concerns. Legally, if the security has paid a fourth of the revenue for which he is responsible, he is released from every public demand. Supposing him to have paid the fourth, but to have realized the whole demand from the estate, in which way is the revenue recoverable? The ruin of the estate is too often the object of the security, and possession gives him full means to effect that purpose. As many talukas have arisen through this cause, the landholders of large estates become security to ruin the smaller zamind\u00e1rs, and thereby increase their estates by the purchase of the former zamind\u00e1rs' lands. The sufferings of the former class from this one cause are numberless, and I have reason to believe that nearly one-eighth of the whole landed property in this district is in this predicament.\" The Board replied that they were aware of the inconveniences to which landholders were exposed by the requisition of security, and contemplated proposing to Government, from the expiration of the present leases, the exemption of actual proprietors of land from the necessity of furnishing it. But it was not till November, 1817, that the Board authorized the Collector to dispense with the requisition of security in cases where it appeared unnecessary for the safety of the revenue.\n\nThe settlement in the parganahs lately farmed was in every instance a progressive one, and was adopted with a view of affording temporary relief to the newly admitted village proprietors, and, at the same time, of retaining ultimately the assessment which these talukad\u00e1rs were understood to have realized from them. It was also adopted in Firuzabad and Jalesar for the sake of securing the highest obtainable assessment for the last year of the lease, as such final assessment was, under the provisions of Regulation 7, 1807, to become permanent. This object failed in most of these parganahs. Mr. Newnham, writing\u00b2 in 1811, says:\u2014\"The change in the management of the lands (from farmers to zam\u00edn-d\u00e1rs) appears to have failed in continuing the same state of high cultivation; in the place of a floating capital, of the command of labour, and all the ready powers of agriculture, men who had no wealth but their industry and proprietary rights were introduced, and who could not be expected to be able to entice\n\n\u00b9 To Board, 1st January, 1811. \u00b2 To Board 30th July, 1811.\ninto their villages, ryots to cultivate the lands which had been tilled by the personal servants of the talukadar as labourers, or as assignments in lieu of money wages, which compensation was not omitted in the account of the assets. The newly acknowledged zamindars could only look to their ryots, on whom they increased the demand in proportion that the Government demand increased towards themselves. A ryot, insolvent through misfortune, or resisting a claim he could scarcely discharge, soon gave rise to difficulties, and the ruinous vacancy which the flight or death of ryots or labourers occasioned was in no way to be remedied.\"\n\nThe next settlement was for four years. Since the revocation by the authorities in Europe of the promised permanency of the second triennial settlement might have been understood to authorize a recurrence to the original provisions of Regulation IX. of 1805, which had prescribed that, on the expiration of such second triennial settlement, a third settlement for four years, from 1219 to 1222 fasli was to be formed on specified principles, it would probably have been advisable to have adopted this measure to equalize the assessments on particular estates; but as Regulation X. of 1812, which rescinded Regulation X. of 1807, was silent in regard to such intermediate re-settlement, the only modifications attempted during the four years preceding the expiration of the decennial period from the conquest (1223 fasli), for which provision was made, consisted of annual expedients for the management of the deteriorated estates, while those who continued to pay the assessments of 1218 fasli were left undisturbed.\n\nMr. C. F. Ferguson in 1812-13 slightly increased the revenue, and the number of persons admitted to engagements rose from 3,324 to 4,612, showing that the Board's directions in 1810 were not overlooked. Though the charges of collection were decreased, and there was more supervision, heavy balances accrued, with remissions, reductions, and partial re-settlements, in consequence of landholders absconding and sales of land administration not meeting purchasers. The accounts of the re-settlement of farmed villages show a decrease in the revenue of Rs. 90,443 in 1219, Rs. 23,474 in 1220, and Rs. 1,03,600 in 1221. Attempts at the demarcation of village boundaries were now for the first time made. In 1814-15, the Western Board sent Messrs. Calvert and Boulderson to take charge of a portion of the district. Parganahs Antupshahr, Akrabad, Gangiri, Jahangirabad, Jalali, Pachlana, and Sikandra Rao were made over to Mr. Calvert, together with some parganahs of Etawa and Fatehgarh. Parganahs Sadabad, Khandauli, Mahaban, Mat, Firuzabad, Jalesar, Raya, Sonai, and Sahpu were intrusted to Mr. Boulderson, and Mr. Ferguson retained charge of Koil and the remaining parganahs. In 1816, Mr. Ferguson resumed charge of the eastern division on Mr. Calvert's departure. In the same year, three\nparganahs, Firuzabad, Sahpu and Khandauli, were transferred to Agra, and at that time paid a revenue of Rs. 3,77,711. At the same time Noh Jhil and Sikandra were given over to Mr. Boulderson, and the Kasganj tahsil was received from Etawa.\n\nThe fourth settlement for five years was made by Messrs. Ferguson, Calvert and Boulderson for the parganahs under their respective charges, giving an aggregate land revenue of Rs. 30,29,833, being an increase on the former settlement of Rs. 2,74,638. In the old farmed parganahs the rates established by Mr. Boulderson reached the highest assessment of 1218. In submitting an account of the portions of the district settled by Messrs. Ferguson and Calvert, the Board of Commissioners, after noticing the considerations which led to the extension of the settlement of 1218 for four years, and the principles on which that measure was founded, remark:\u2014\u201cA progressive settlement, which should rest on a speculation of prospective improvement, will generally defeat itself. The landholders seldom look beyond the immediate operations of the current year, and will thoughtlessly bind themselves to a future incumbrance of any extent for the sake of a present relief. A moderate enhancement would perhaps stimulate their exertions, and industry to meet it, particularly if it be limited to a portion of the lease, so as to leave to them in the remainder of the term the benefits of such industry. But, generally speaking, when the actual pressure of a load (the weight of which they did not estimate) falls upon them, they recede in despair from the struggle, and the result not only disappoints the anticipated increase from expected improvement, but will frequently produce a retrograde falling off in the former cultivation. This remark is fully exemplified in several of the accounts now submitted to your Lordship, where the deficiency on the ultimate demand of the former settlement far exceeds the difference between that demand and what had been punctually realized in the early part of the lease. The remark might also be deemed as affording an argument against the new arrangements which are proposed for your Lordship\u2019s sanction, as a large proportion of them are at a progressive assessment. But in the present instance the measure is principally confined to the re-establishment of temporary abatements. Those cases in which the progressive assessment is at an increase upon the former settlement are comparatively few, and of inconsiderable amount, and the further additions to the assessment of the current year, which has been realized with sufficient punctuality, are trifling. In taking a view of these settlements, and of the accounts of the other portion of the district, we cannot hesitate in offering to your Lordship our deliberate opinion that no increase of revenue can be expected from any future\n\n---\n\n1 Sahpu, Rs. 40,028; Khandauli, Rs. 65,255; Firuzabad, Rs. 209,428; see Board\u2019s Records, 6th November, 1816, No. 1.\n2 Ibid, 31st December, 1816, No. 16\nre-settlement of this district. These arrangements have certainly remedied many errors and inaccuracies which have occurred in the former settlement; but, exclusive of errors, which are perhaps unavoidable in a general settlement, and of probable embarrassments from unfavourable seasons, much counteraction to any future re-settlement is to be apprehended from the landholders themselves, who have learnt the mode of anticipating the requisition of an increase by a reduction of the assets towards the expiration of the lease, either by throwing the land altogether out of cultivation, or by discontinuing the culture of the more valuable produce, such as sugar-cane, cotton, &c. This latter measure affects also the revenue of the customs. Section 7, Regulation IX., 1805, held out to the landholders of the conquered provinces the hope of a permanent settlement from the year 1223. The promise may, indeed, be said to be partial, and to be not very clearly defined, as it is restricted to those lands which may be in a state of cultivation to warrant the measure. But the landholders looked only to the promise, and did not calculate on the reservation attached to it. The disappointment is accordingly general. Even under this reservation, a majority of the parganahs in this district would, on a comparison of the improvable land with that in actual cultivation, be found not to possess more of the former than what the landholders might be deemed entitled to as the future reward of their industry. Considerable abatements were granted (in some cases apparently on insufficient grounds) in the first years of this settlement; but the Board deemed it expedient to waive a retrospective revision of them, an indulgence which has probably contributed to the punctuality with which the revenue has, generally speaking, hitherto been paid. The land fit for cultivation is stated at more than two-thirds of the land under tillage, so that of the arable land little more than seven-twelfths are in cultivation. The waste also appears very extensive,\u00b9 \u2014 the twenty-five parganahs, regarding which this information is furnished, exhibit 281 farms out of an aggregate of 1,692 estates.\u201d\n\nThis quinquennial settlement was extended in the ceded parganahs for five years by Regulation XVI. of 1816, and again for five years by order of Government in 1822, and for a further term of five years, from 1235 to 1239 fa\u0161li (1827-8 to 1831-2 A.D.), by Government orders of the 13th April 1826. In the conquered parganahs it was extended for five years, from 1228 to 1232 fa\u0161li, by orders of Government in 1818. Soon after the formation of this settlement it was found advisable to restrain tahsildars from exacting interest on balances and from taking villages under direct management without the express sanction of the Collector. These settlements were again extended from 1233 to 1237 fa\u0161li (1815-16 to 1829-30, A.D.), to allow time for the inquiries directed by Regulation VII. of 1822,\n\n\u00b9 Settlement Records, N.W.P., 82.\nwhile certain parganahs in which the errors were most glaring were exempted from the rule of extension and were immediately settled.\n\nFor the settlement under Regulation VII. of 1822 scarcely any extra establishment was allowed in this district, and the Collector's time was too much occupied by the other duties of his office to admit of his careful attention being given to the detailed and laborious enquiry prescribed by Regulation VII. of 1822. It was found at the next settlement of this district, that villages settled under this Regulation were generally over-assessed. Mr. H. Rose, in reporting the settlements of parganahs Jalali, Akabad, Sikandra Rao and Marahra in 1839, writes that \"out of 37 villages settled under Regulation VII. of 1822, 35 required reduction of revenue to the extent of Rs. 6,440, on a jama of Rs. 47,533. The system of settlement under that Regulation undoubtedly tended to cause over-assessment; but that system, faulty as it was, had not fair play in this district, where the Settlement Officer, when he was not satisfied with the revenue which his papers warranted him to demand, was in the habit of appointing native assessors for the express purpose of raising the estimate of assets. That under such a method of settlement some estates should have broken down and others should now exhibit marks of over-assessment is not to be wondered at. The matter for surprise is that the whole have not been ruined long ago.\"\n\nMr. Stirling gives the following lamentable description of the state of the district in his time:\u2014\"The consequence of the inadequacy of the tahsili establishments, and their inefficiency, has been that almost all the villages in this district have been mortgaged, farmed, sold or given over to creditors. A few intriguing, dishonest and avaricious men, have by indirect means possessed themselves of the greater portion of the most flourishing estates in this district. These changes of property have upset all kinds of village rights, and the individual claims of cultivators, amongst whom tenfold more distress has been occasioned than has been experienced in any district of which I have had charge.\" In a subsequent letter to the Commissioner of Agra, dated 19th May, 1832, Mr. Stirling attributes much of the prevailing distress in the country to the abolition of the Benares mint, the bankruptcy of indigo factories, and the reduced purchases of Government. He stated the effects of the abolition of the mint to be, first, a considerable enhancement of the price of coin as compared with silver bullion; second, an unavoidable continued debasement of the currency; third, a growing scarcity of the circulating medium; and he considered the commerce and agriculture of the country to have suffered from these causes at the rate of eleven per cent., and that the prices of commodities and of grain and labour had fallen to that extent. The bankruptcy of all the indigo manufactories not only occasioned the failure of many respectable native houses,\nbut swept away a large amount of currency from those channels of circulation in which it had been long employed, and had afforded occupation to the industry of a great number of commercial men and agriculturists. Such a convulsion caused no inconsiderable distress; but happily the immediate loss did not fall with too great a weight on the country. Owing to the practice of making large advances, the people had received perhaps more than the full price of their labour and commodities, and when the treasure usually expended on indigo works ceased to flow, they had only to turn their attention to the production of grain. Mr. Stirling calculated the diminution of the Company's purchases to be about ten lakhs of rupees annually. At the same time Mr. Smith thinks\\(^1\\) that, during this period, though at first much land was left out of cultivation and many of the old proprietors lost their villages, still there had been much general progress. In 1815, the total cultivated area of the district as it then stood, exclusive of the large talukas, was only 934,078 acres; and if 100,000 acres be taken as the area under cultivation in the talukas, the total cultivated area will have been 1,084,078 acres. \"But the cultivated area of the district, reduced to its present size at the time of last settlement, was 839,127 acres, or 81 per cent. of the total cultivation of about three districts in 1815. I am rather under the mark in concluding that by the time the last settlement was finished, cultivation in Aligarh, even since 1815, had at least doubled, and that since 1803 it must have more than doubled. In 1815 the revenue fell at Rs. 3-6-5 per cultivated acre, and at last settlement (1838) though the revenue was increased, it fell at only Rs. 2-8-1 per cultivated acre.\"\n\nIn 1833, Mr. John Thornton was appointed to officiate as Deputy Collector of Aligarh, and was intrusted with the revision of the settlement under Regulation IX. of 1833. He joined his appointment in December of that year, and remained in charge of the settlement office five years, during which time he finished the settlement of parganahs H\u00e1thras, Murs\u00e1n, Gorai, Hasangarh, Khair, Chandaus, Somna, Koil, Atr\u00e1uli, Murthal and the talukas of Bhamauri N\u00e1h and D\u00e1tanli. He also made a summary settlement for six years of parganah Tappal, part of the j\u00e1gir of the Begam Sumru, which had lapsed by her death in 1837. Mr. Thornton was succeeded by Mr. H. Rose, who took charge in December, 1838, and finished the settlement of the remaining parganahs, viz., Sikandra Rao, M\u00e1rahra, Akra-bad, Jal\u00e1li and Barauli in July, 1839. Both Mr. Thornton and Mr. Rose were ably assisted by Mr. W. B. Wright, formerly Superintendent of the Customs line at Hansi, who was appointed, at Mr. Thornton's recommendation, in 1837, as Assistant in the settlement. In 1840, parganah Tappal was resettled by Mr. Wright, at a revenue of Rs. 1,18,206.\n\n\\(^1\\) Settlement Report, p. 63: the opinion of Mr. Smith as Settlement Officer is particularly valuable on this point.\nBy this revision of the settlement a total increase in the assessment was gained of Rs. 75,785, but this increase was mainly effected on the estates of some of the talukadars, who, during the past settlements, had contrived to conceal their real resources. Under the new system of settlement, such an evasion of the just demand of Government was almost impossible. The Settlement Officer no longer trusted to arbitrary valuations of assets and estimates of area formed by the kanungoes and patwaries. Each village was accurately surveyed, measured and mapped, field by field, and the lands divided into four classes with reference to their proximity to the village, as at present. These four classes were comprehended in the two great divisions of irrigated and unirrigated lands, and for each class average parganah rent-rates were framed from the results of a careful enquiry into the actual rents paid by cultivators for such lands, and by a comparison with the rates in neighbouring parganahas. These rates, applied to the areas of each class of land, gave the village rent-roll or gross assets of each village, and the jama or Government demand was then obtained by a deduction in favour of the zamindars of not less than 30 per cent. on the gross assets. This demand was further tested by an examination of the recorded assets of the estate for the past ten years, and by the daul or estimate of the tahsildars. Nothing could be more fair than such an assessment, provided that the lands were rightly classified. Mr. Thornton and Mr. Rose were careful to satisfy themselves on these important points; one or two of the talukadars tried to obtain easy terms by throwing a great proportion of their lands out of cultivation at the time of settlement, and by stopping up their earthen wells; but Mr. Thornton readily detected the fraud.\n\nThe revenue survey was made between the years 1833 and 1837, when parganah Tappal was surveyed by Captain Brown, and the remaining parganahs by Captain Wroughton. In most instances the kharaas or indices, and shajrahs or field maps were furnished by the survey establishment, but it is to be regretted that these important documents were in general drawn up very incorrectly, especially the field maps.\n\nMr. W. H. Smith made the existing settlement of the district between 1866 and 1873. In reviewing the past fiscal history of the district, he writes:\u2014\"From all the authorities and facts which I have considered, my deductions are as follows:\u2014That at the time of the conquest the entire district was in a terrible state of disorganization; that population was defective and much land out of cultivation; that the zamindars generally were in a depressed and unsettled state; and that they were called upon to pay a very heavy revenue before they had recovered from the injurious results of former misrule, but that the good effect of our rule very soon became manifest. With the aid of remissions and reductions, which were largely resorted to, in other words, by lenient treatment, they tided over times of difficulty.\"\nMeanwhile population and cultivation alike increased, and within 30 years there was double as much land under the plough as before, while the assessments having been, with few exceptions, left untouched after 1819, the incidence of the revenue rate on the cultivated acre fell lower and lower, and at the end the people were paying half the rate for double the amount of land. No doubt the revenue was even then heavy, and from time to time bad seasons may have caused much individual and partial distress, but on the whole the landholders of the district maintained their original position, and the general results of the 30 years was a constantly improved revenue administration, and in the mass an enormous amelioration in general progress and prosperity.\"\n\nThe principles of assessment adopted at the present settlement were substantially the same as those described above, but in working out the average rates, the particular rates which each class of soil actually paid were first discovered, and then these rates were applied to the soils as classified, and the general total of these rates was taken as the estimate for the tract of country for which they had been selected. The classification of soils adopted has already been noticed (p. 352); and here it may be said that this classification is the one acknowledged by the people in their own transactions; and the rates found to prevail, and on which the assessment is based, represent actual facts. The general rates, modified by the peculiar local characteristics of each estate, form the basis of the individual assessment of these estates. The following statement shows the initial and expiring revenue of the past settlement, and the new revenue for each tahsil in the district:\n\n| Tahsil | Initial revenue of past settlement | Expiring revenue of past settlement | Initial revenue of present settlement | Expiring revenue of present settlement |\n|--------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n|        | Rs.                               | Rs.                                | Rs.                                 | Rs.                                   |\n| Atranli | 2,47,136                          | 2,46,407                           | 2,92,144                            | 1,13 3 1 1 5 1 4 8 1 10 3 1 4 7 1 8 1 15 1 |\n| Eoil   | 3,01,900                          | 3,01,400                           | 3,67,144                            | 2 3 0 1 2 1 12 6 1 15 9 1 14 7 1 8 1 15 1 |\n| Ieda   | 3,01,400                          | 3,01,400                           | 3,67,144                            | 2 3 0 1 2 1 12 6 1 15 9 1 14 7 1 8 1 15 1 |\n| Khair  | 3,55,177                          | 3,54,406                           | 4,01,050                            | 2 3 1 6 9 1 9 6 1 14 4 1 8 8 1 13 10 2 2 4 |\n| Bathing| 3,91,751                          | 3,96,074                           | 4,15,520                            | 2 12 9 2 2 8 2 9 2 11 5 2 4 0 1 8 11 4 2 15 8 |\n| Shandra Rao | 3,85,657                        | 2,10,357                           | 3,97,350                            | 2 12 9 2 2 8 2 9 2 11 5 2 4 0 1 8 11 4 2 15 8 |\n| Total  | 18,41,242                         | 18,47,760                          | 21,47,343                           | 2 3 1 1 7 7 1 13 0 2 0 11 1 11 5 3 1 8 1 6 9 |\n\nThe new assessment has resulted in an increase of Rs. 3,06,100, or 16\u00b76 per cent. over the initial revenue of the old assessment, and of Rs. 2,90,573, or 16\u00b72 per cent. over the current revenue, and this, too, though the proportion taken by the State has fallen from 68\u00b79 per cent. to 50 per cent. of the rental assets. The causes of this increase are the increase in cultivation, population and irrigation, and the rise in the value of land, rents and prices. Besides the land revenue,\nRs. 2,14,551-7-6 are collected for the ten per cent. cess under Act XVIII. of 1871, and Rs. 1,08,117 for patw\u0101ris' fees, bringing up the total demand from the district to Rs. 24,70,011, and giving an increase of 23\u00b78 per cent. on the old demand. In tahsilis Koil and Atrauli, the new demand was collected in 1871-72; in Igl\u00e1s and Khair in 1872-73; and in H\u00e1thras and Sikandra Rao in 1873-74. The settlement will probably be confirmed from 1871 to 1901.\n\nThe following statement gives the official account of the revenue demand, collections, and balances from 1860-61 to 1872-73.\n\n| Year | Demands | Collection | Balances |\n|------|---------|------------|----------|\n|      | Rs.     | Rs.        | Rs.      |\n| 1860-61 | 18,32,750 | 17,12,038 | 1,20,712 |\n| 1861-62 | 18,42,735 | 17,86,684 | 56,111 |\n| 1862-63 | 18,48,697 | 17,98,623 | 49,874 |\n| 1863-64 | 18,41,974 | 18,38,853 | 7,981 |\n| 1864-65 | 18,41,952 | 18,37,738 | 18,864 |\n| 1865-66 | 18,40,445 | 18,30,828 | 10,617 |\n| 1866-67 | 18,40,905 | 18,37,150 | 1,750 |\n| 1867-68 | 18,40,601 | 18,39,452 | 1,149 |\n| 1868-69 | 18,40,060 | 18,38,349 | 1,111 |\n| 1869-70 | 18,40,435 | 18,37,648 | 2,580 |\n| 1870-71 | 18,40,659 | 18,39,163 | 1,496 |\n| 1871-72 | 19,63,805 | 19,51,775 | 830 |\n| 1872-73 | 30,05,468 | 20,05,050 | 418 |\n\nTurning from the land to the proprietary body, I shall now take up the great talukas for which the district is noted. For the history of the J\u00e1t taluk\u00e1s of H\u00e1thras, Murs\u00e1n and Igl\u00e1s, we have the valuable report of Mr. John Thornton, from which the following account is mainly taken. All these families trace their origin to a man named Makan, who about the end of the sixteenth or the beginning of the seventeenth century came from Rajput\u00e1na to the neighbourhood of Murs\u00e1n. He was a J\u00e1t of the Tenwa tribe, and on his arrival found the country occupied by Rajputs and J\u00e1ts of the Khokhen tribe. Makan married a woman of the Khokhen tribe, and partly through the influence of her clansmen, and partly, probably, on account of the surrounding country being imperfectly cultivated, he and his descendants, during the next three generations, were enabled to obtain possession of a considerable tract of country, which they divided amongst themselves. Each sub-division became the parent of a number of hamlets (d\u0101khli mauta), the occupants of which are all of the same caste, and trace their origin to the common ancestor who founded the parent village (asli).\n\n1 Settlement Reports, N.-W. P., I., 247.\nThese clusters of villages in the course of time became known as talukas. The tract occupied by the Tenwa J\u00e1ta was known as tappa Jo\u00e1r, because the town of Jo\u00e1r or Jaw\u00e1r was the principal place therein, or the residence of the head of the family. Tappa Jo\u00e1r belonged to parganah Jalesar, but in the reign of Shahjah\u00e1n (in 1652 A.D.), Sadullah Kh\u00e1n took 200 villages from Jalesar, including the J\u00e1t tappa, 80 villages from Mah\u00e1ban, and 7 from Khandauli, and formed them into a new parganah, which he called after his own name, Sadabad. The J\u00e1t confederation had become firmly established at the death of Shahjah\u00e1n in 1658 A.D.; and during the wars that ensued for the possession of the throne, Nandr\u00e1m, a great-grandson of Makan, found means to establish himself as head of his tribe. Possessed of great abilities, and supported by the Porach Raja of Dary\u00e1pur, Nandr\u00e1m not only refused to pay the land-tax, but succeeded in incorporating several villages not owned by J\u00e1ts into the J\u00e1t tappa of Jo\u00e1r. When Aurangzeb became firmly established on the throne, Nandr\u00e1m submitted to the emperor, and was rewarded with the khidmat zam\u00edn-dari or revenue management of Jo\u00e1r and Toohigarh. He subsequently received a grant, conferring the police management also upon him, with the title of faujd\u00e1r.\n\nNandr\u00e1m's influence remained unimpaired until his death in 1695 A.D.\n\nSuccessors of Nandr\u00e1m. He left fourteen sons, of whom three only need be mentioned here:\u2014Zulkaran, the eldest; Jai Singh, the second son; and Bhoj Singh, the seventh son. The H\u00e1thras family is descended from Jai Singh, and that of Murs\u00e1n from Zulkaran Singh. Zulkaran died before his father, and for some years Bhoj Singh took the lead amongst the brethren. It is probable that the authority of Bhoj Singh varied just as he was able to secure the favour of the local Government officers. At last, in 1716 A.D., Bhoj Singh obtained from Sayyid Abdullah, the famous minister of Farrukhsiy\u00e1r, a grant in terms similar to that conferred upon Nandr\u00e1m by Aurangzeb, and in the following year a remission of revenue as j\u00e1gir. The two brothers, Jai Singh and Bhoj Singh, divided the tappa equally between them, and transmitted their possessions to their sons. Bhoj Singh died in 1750 A.D. and left three sons. Of these, Mohan Singh obtained taluka Simardhari; Jagat Singh, the eldest son, received talukas Barha and Tuks\u00e1n, and left Barha to his eldest son, Part\u00e1b, whilst his second son, Mukt\u00e1wal Singh, received Tuks\u00e1n, and transferred it to Phup Singh of Murs\u00e1n. Kanjal Singh, the third son of Bhoj Singh, received Chotwa and Kotha Patta, but he was ousted in 1768 on account of arrears, and the talukas were divided between the H\u00e1thras and Murs\u00e1n Rajas.\n\nWe have now to trace the history of the family of Jai Singh. He died in 1749 A.D., and left two sons: S\u00e1want Singh, the younger son, received a number of villages as his share, which he formed into a taluka named Gubr\u00e1ri; but the greater portion of the estate came into the hands of the eldest son, Bar\u00e1n Singh, a man of great ac-\nvity and determination of character. In 1752 Baran Singh induced the amil of the Oudh Vazir to transfer to him H\u00e2thras and the surrounding villages, held until then by a clan of Porach Rajputs, and when Surajmal, in 1760, expelled Ratan Singh, the Porach talukadar of Mendo, Baran Singh had influence enough to secure the revenue management for himself. Baran Singh died in 1668 and left two sons. The younger of these, by name Sakat Singh, succeeded to most of those villages included in his father's estate which had formed a portion of the old tappa Joar. These were divided after his death into two smaller talukas, K\u00e2ras and Kar\u00eel,\u2014the former fell to the share of his son Durga Singh, and the second son, Udai Singh, obtained Kar\u00eel. But all the individual acquisitions of Baran Singh descended to his eldest son, Bh\u00fbri Singh, who did not survive many years, and during whose time the estate appears neither to have increased nor diminished. Bh\u00fbri Singh died in 1775 A.D., and Daya R\u00e1m, his youngest son, found means to supplant his elder brother, Nawal Singh, in by far the larger part of his father's possessions. The latter retired to Besw\u00e1n and founded the Besw\u00e1n taluka.\n\nBefore commencing the history of Daya R\u00e1m, I will give the genealogical tree of the family, from Makan the founder, which will show the ancestors from whom the several taluka-d\u00e2rs in H\u00e2thras are descended. It is taken from Mr. Thornton's report, and purposely omits mention of those sons of Nandr\u00e2m whose descendants are extinct, or who obtained portions of territory which never came at a subsequent period into the possession of Daya R\u00e1m, and which have therefore never been included in parganah H\u00e2thras:\n\n```\nMakan.\nSona.\nKunwar Sen.\nNandram, Fauld\u00e1r.\nZailasa, (see Murad.)\nJai Singh.\nBhoj Singh.\nChaturram, (Tochigarh.)\nJaswant.\nAdhiram, (Sringar)\nBijal, (Harrampur.)\nBaran.\nSawant Singh.\nSubba Ram,\n(Kajran.)\nBairi\u00e2l,\n(Sharees in Tochigarh.)\nTej Singh,\nHar\u00fbl.\nBhawan, (Gubr\u00e2l.)\nKh\u00e2ban, (Gubr\u00e2l.)\nHar\u00fbl Thakur Daya R\u00e1m.\nJiw\u00e2ram Har\u00eesh\u00e2n.\nGebind, Sakat.\nJagat Singh.\nMohal Singh.\nKunal Singh.\nHar\u00fbl Thakur\n(see Mundin.)\nJalkhan, (see Besw\u00e1n and Shahuddpur.)\nAdopted son.\nDurga.\nUdai.\nSundar,\n(see K\u00e2ras.)

They had possession of other villages also at different times; but as all but these two had been in possession of Daya R\u00e1m for 38 years, the possession of the descendants of these two sons of Nandr\u00e1m was confirmed in these two villages only. The descendants also of Bijai Singh were confirmed in the possession of Harr\u00e1mpur as a tenure of talukas Barha and Gujr\u00e1t. Mukt\u00e1wal Singh, son of Jagat Singh, was dispossessed of his estate by Phup Singh of Murs\u00e1n, who also acquired Kanjal Singh's share in Kotha Patha, and his share in Chotwa fell to Daya R\u00e1m.\n\n\"A few separate villages were added to the estate by Th\u00e1kur Daya R\u00e1m, through arrangements made with the amils of the neighbouring parganahs; but his chief efforts appear to have been directed towards the expulsion of the other descendants of Nand R\u00e1m from their several estates, and the annexation of the latter to his own extensive possessions. In 1776 A.D., taluka Simardhari fell into his hands. In 1779, taluka Tochigarh met the same fate. Taluka Gubr\u00e1ri followed in 1794, and taluka Barha in 1799 A.D. The last named taluka had been taken out of the talukad\u00e1r's hands by the Marhattas 22 years before, during which interval the revenue was collected by amils from the village communities. These transactions are said by Th\u00e1kur Daya R\u00e1m to have taken place in the way of sale, mortgage or the like, but it is probable that little option was allowed to the weaker party. The subsequent possession of the Th\u00e1kur was not uninterrupted, as the Government of the time in some years preferred to collect its dues from each village by means of its own officers. Talukas K\u00e1ras and Karil were allowed to remain in the hands of their former occupants, who were more nearly related to Daya R\u00e1m, as the foregoing account will show; but they were considered as included in the main estate, and the revenue required from them by the Government was paid by Th\u00e1kur Daya R\u00e1m himself. Such was the state of things at the commencement of our rule in 1803 A.D.\"\n\nAfter the conquest of Aligarh, the Commander-in-Chief used every means in his power to conciliate Daya R\u00e1m. He was confirmed in the possession of his ancestral lands in H\u00e1thras on the same terms on which he had held them under the Marhatta Government. The revenue was fixed at Rs. 1,62,828, and remained at that sum until 1807-8. In the following year talukas Gubr\u00e1ri and Simardhari were assigned to him in jdg\u00e9, and he was allowed to engage for the remainder of the parganah at a revenue, fixed for his life at Rs. 93,620. No kind of interference was made with his interior management, and indeed he was allowed to remain so independent that the people count the introduction of British rule in the parganah from the date of Daya R\u00e1m's expulsion. It was probably the injudicious\nrelaxation of our due authority and superintendence which led to his eventual ruin. During the commotions caused by the war with Holkar and the rebellion of Dundi Khan, Daya Ram certainly did good service: he kept his part of the district free from the rebels, and he also raised a force of cavalry, for which however he was paid liberally by the Commander-in-Chief. But he soon displayed a spirit of insubordination and disaffection, and as early as September, 1806, the Resident of Delhi wrote to the Magistrate of Aligarh to the effect that letters had been received by Holkar from Daya Ram expressive of discontent, and recommending the Magistrate to keep a watchful eye on him. Daya Ram and the other chiefs of his tribe, viz., Bhagwant Singh of Mursan, and Harkishan Singh of Beswan, appear to have made it a point of honour never to pay the Government demand till the last moment to which they could safely put it off; and the Collector, conscious of his inability to enforce the demand, was obliged to content himself with repeated remonstrances, and an occasional vigorous representation to the Board of Commissioners of the state of affairs in those talukas. On one occasion, 8th August, 1810, the Collector stated that \"the principle on which these talukadars withhold their revenue is, that in the event of hostilities they may have a supply of cash, or that Government, with a view to the debt, may be prevented from proceeding to extremities.\" Not less frequent were the complaints of the Magistrates against these talukadars for affording a secure asylum to offenders of all descriptions, for levying arbitrary duties, for omitting to report the occurrence of heinous crimes, and for disregarding the authority of the courts of judicature. At length, in July, 1816, the Magistrate (Mr. Majoribanks) reported the gross misconduct of Thakur Daya Ram in refusing, after repeated injunctions, to deliver up four offenders in a case of murder; and he strongly recommended that both Daya Ram and Bhagwant Singh should be deprived of their privilege of exemption from the police system introduced in the other parts of the district. This report reached the Supreme Government at a time when it was particularly politic not to pass over such misconduct, as a rising of the Pathan population of Rohilkhand a few months before had shown that the minds of the people in this part of our dominions were very unsettled. \"It was therefore important to strike a blow that should impress all ranks with a proper estimate of our vigour and military means. At the close of 1816 it was resolved to reduce both Daya Ram and\n\n---\n\n1 In 1806 Daya Ram held a farm of Rs. 3,31,000 revenue, and was proprietor of an estate assessed at Rs. 1,56,000. For matters connected with his history see Board's Records, 2nd April, 1806, No. 6; 20th June, 1806, No. 17; 27th June, 1806, No. 17 to 30 August, 1806, No. 1; 26th August, 1806, Nos. 7-8; 5th September, 1806, No. 17-23; 23rd September, 1806; 18th January, 1807, No. 6-7; 6th February, 1807, No. 7; 23rd January, 1808, No. 26; 26th May, 1808, No. 5; 29th August, 1808, No. 22; 21st February, 1809, No. 25; 26th February, 1809, No. 48; 26th March, 1809, No. 46-58; 8th June, 1809, No. 27; 21st November, 1809, No. 81A; 21st November 1809, No. 29.\nBhagwant Singh to the level of subjects, and to employ an overwhelming force for that purpose, as well to beat down all opposition as to give eclat to the measure. The divisions from Cawnpore, Meerut and Muttra were accordingly ordered to concentrate upon H\u00e2thras, and place themselves under the immediate command of Major-General Marshall, the officer commanding in the field. H\u00e2thras was reckoned one of the strongest forts in India. It was kept in the completest state of repair, and every improvement that was introduced into the neighbouring fortress of Aligarh, such as preparing a covered way, raising a glacis, and levelling the height of the ramparts, was carefully copied by Daya R\u00e1m. On the 21st of February the place was invested on all sides; and Daya R\u00e1m was then summoned to surrender a gate of his fort, and allow of its being dismantled. After some evasion on his part, and a negotiation which lasted till the 16th, he finally refused, when the siege immediately commenced. The katra or fortified town was breached and evacuated on the 23rd; approaches were then made to the fort, and batteries erected under a smart though ineffectual fire from the ramparts. By the 1st of March the works of the besiegers were completed, and on the following morning forty-two mortars and three breaching batteries of heavy guns began to play on the fort. Such powerful means had never yet been employed against any fortified place in India, and the effect was beyond measure destructive and astonishing to the garrison. The batteries continued to play till evening, when at 5 o'clock a large magazine blew up within the place, destroying half the garrison and nearly all the buildings. The effect is described to have been awful. Daya R\u00e1m with a few horse made his escape in the dark that same night, and, though challenged and pursued by a piquet of the 8th dragoons, got off with little-damage. The rest of the garrison, in attempting to follow, were driven in and obliged to surrender at discretion. Bhagwant Singh agreed to dismantle his fort on the first summons; and thus was this important object gained, with the loss of only one European and five natives killed on our side, while the impression of the utter futility of resistance spread far and wide through Hindustan.\"\n\nOn the expulsion of Daya R\u00e1m his property was confiscated, and an opportunity arose for restoring the condition of the village occupants, and for admitting them to the same liberal terms and the same direct intercourse with Government that were allowed to men of a similar class in other places. Notwithstanding the oppressive and arbitrary rule of Daya R\u00e1m, the original proprietors, in the greater number of villages, \"still adhered to the soil, which they claimed as their own, and even where this was not the case, there frequently existed individuals or families who, though originally located by the talukadar himself, and therefore not strictly entitled to protection, might have been considered worthy of it from\n\n---\n\n1 Prinsep's Transactions in India, I., 419.\nlong possession, improvement of the cultivation, or other causes. If this liberal and just course had been then pursued after due and careful enquiry, all the distress and confusion which subsequently existed might have been avoided, and there would still have remained a considerable number of estates, to the occupancy of which no one could with reason lay claim, and which might therefore have been made over by Government to any one whom they wished to favour. But though all correspondence which took place at the time shows clearly that the intentions of Government coincided with the above views, yet those intentions were defeated by the superficial way in which the question was taken up by the local officers, and the too ready acquiescence of the Board of Revenue in their representations. Misled by the title of zamindar, which Daya Ram had enjoyed in the greater part of the parganah, and considering, as was then too often done, that the unrestricted power which the Thakur had exercised was the true index to his just and rightful interest, the Collector thought that no individuals or communities throughout the parganah could be entitled to protection, for the sole reason that none had hitherto been protected. It followed as a necessary corollary to this proposition, that the Government were authorized, after Daya Ram's forfeiture, to make over any portion of the estate, to whomever they chose, in absolute proprietary tenure, and to derive a larger revenue from such part as they might keep in their own hands than would have been demanded from a tract of equal size and fertility elsewhere.\n\n\"In consequence of these unfortunate and erroneous conclusions, the five talukas of Joar, viz., Simardhari, Barha, Gubrari, Karil and Kuras, were restored to the descendants of the former talukadars, who, in the three first cases, had been wholly dispossessed for the respective periods of forty-one, forty, and twenty-three years, while the real owners or occupants of the soil in every separate village, who still retained and cultivated it, were admitted to no engagements, and were left in the condition of tenants-at-will. The rest of the parganah was composed of single and independent villages, of which 31 were made over to Thakur Jiwa Ram as a mark of the favour of Government under the name of taluka Mendu, and 20 were committed in the same manner to Thakur Jaikishan, under the appellation of taluka Shahzadpur. These two individuals, of whom the former was a son, and the latter a grandson, of Nawal Singh, elder brother of Daya Ram, were supposed to have shown good will to our authority during the operations against Hathras. This indeed was a politic, and in their case, owing to the supersession of Nawal Singh before narrated, a natural course to adopt. After the success of those operations they applied to be admitted as farmers of part of the forfeited estate; but the Governor-General thought fit to direct, as a fuller means of evincing his approbation of their services, that they should be installed...\"\nas proprietors of some of those villages which might have been held by Th\u00e1kur Daya R\u00e1m, 'in undisputed proprietary tenure.' No injustice could have been caused by this order if it had been properly executed; but as it was left to the Collector to decide what villages had really been thus held by Daya R\u00e1m, the objections which were urged by the people, whose estates were selected by the new talukad\u00e1rs, against this transfer of them to other masters were disregarded in every instance.\n\nWhen these arrangements had been decided upon, the new settlement, which was to commence with 1226 j\u00e1sli (1818-19 A.D.), came under consideration. This settlement was intended to last for only five years, but unfortunately, with the exception of 13 villages and certain modifications of the land revenue in others, it remained in force till Mr. Thornton's revision. Though the higher authorities were still anxious that all under-rights should be protected as well in the different talukas as in that part of the parganah which remained under the immediate management of the Government officers, this object was most imperfectly attained, either as regarded the real and effectual preservation of the under-tenures themselves, or the selection of the parties who were entitled to hold them. A very hasty and incomplete inquiry took place into the names of those who were termed mukadams in every village. Under this unmeaning title were included individuals of all classes, from the original zamind\u00e1r to the ndmi of Th\u00e1kur Daya R\u00e1m, who had obtained possession of a village on condition of furnishing a certain number of horses. And while it was clearly considered indispensable that some persons should be recorded in every case under the appellation in question, even when no one claimed it, it seems to have been thought of little moment, when claimants did appear, to select those who could show the best title. The gross assets of every village being then assumed, in most cases at a very full, and in many at an excessive amount, the revenue payable by these mukadams to the talukad\u00e1rs in talukas Mendu and Shahz\u00e1dpur, and to Government in the miscellaneous villages, was determined by a deduction of only 10 per cent. to cover all risks and expenses, including the patw\u00e1ri's fees. From the amount thus payable by the mukadams in Mendu and Shahz\u00e1dpur, 15 per cent. was deducted for the profit of the talukad\u00e1rs, and the remainder formed the Government revenue. In the five Jo\u00e1r talukas no deduction whatever was made in favour of the mukadams; and though it would seem to have been vaguely intended that no more than the assumed gross rental, under the name of the raiband\u00ed, should be demanded from them, yet this intention, if it really existed, had never been enforced. In these talukas the revenue demandable by Government from the talukad\u00e1rs was determined by a reduction of somewhat more than 20 per cent. from the above mentioned rental or raiband\u00ed.\"\nThe settlement, above described from Mr. Thornton's report, remained in force until 1822-23, and was then extended as regarded Mr. Thornton's revision. The mukadam villages for five years, and subsequently, owing to the misleading advice given by the Collector of the time, up to Mr. Thornton's revision. The Collector's object seems to have been to extract from the already overburdened estates a further allowance for the sons of Daya R\u00e1m. Daya R\u00e1m himself was pardoned, and a residence was provided for him near Koil, with a pension of Rs. 1,000 for himself and Rs. 750 for his family. He died in 1823. The condition of the H\u00e1thras estates in 1835 was most deplorable. Deeds of mortgage existed for parts of almost every estate, and the general debt could not be less than two lakhs of rupees. In talukas Mendu and Shahz\u00e1dpur the people were in still greater difficulties. In the five talukas of Jo\u00e1r, the condition of the cultivating communities was perhaps least miserable where they appeared at first sight to have been most hardly treated. For when they had been excluded from the management of their estates, though still poor and destitute, they escaped being involved in debt, except such as they might have incurred in cultivating their own separate fields. Mr. Thornton adopted the same principles that were followed by him in the settlement of Murs\u00e1n. Where there were no village proprietors in existence, he conferred proprietary rights on the talukad\u00e1r; but where the original proprietors existed, and no transfer of their rights had taken place, he admitted them to engagements. These persons, formerly known as mukadam, were styled biswad\u00e1rs, and the rates of deduction from the rental by which he determined the Government revenue were the same as those which he adopted in Murs\u00e1n, and which are noticed hereafter.\n\nGobind Singh, son of Daya R\u00e1m, continued to live at Koil on a pension of Rs. 750 a month, and during the mutiny did such good service that he was rewarded with the gift of several villages, including the zam\u00ednd\u00e1ri of Koil itself. He died too soon to enjoy his well earned honours, and his estates are now managed by his widow and adopted son.\n\nAs already mentioned, the Murs\u00e1n family is descended from Zulkaran, the eldest son of Nandr\u00e1m. Zulkaran predeceased his father who himself died in 1695, A.D. He left a son, Khush\u00e1l Singh, who resided with his mother at Rahatpur and M\u00e9nkraul,\u2014two villages made over to him by his uncle, for his support. When he grew up to manhood he attracted the favour of the Oudh Vazir, Saadat Kh\u00e1n, who gave him the farm of the following talukas, some of which had probably been in a greater or less degree subject to his grandfather's authority, and had afterwards recovered their independence, but most of them appear not\n\n---\n\n1 Board's Records, 11th August, 1818, No. 35; 11th September, 1818, No. 6; 20th January, 1818, No. 81; 20th June, 1818, No. 82; 3rd April, 1818, No. 91; 14th August, 1818, No. 34; 6th October, 1818, No. 34; 2nd November, 1819.\n\n2 Ibid., 17th October, 1823, No. 2.\nto have been so subject:\u2014Talukas Day\u00e1lpur, Murs\u00e1n kh\u00e1s, Gopi, Puteni, Ahri, B\u00e1r\u00e1m\u00e1i, and six other villages. Phup Singh succeeded his father about the year 1749 A.D., and increased his estates very largely by obtaining, from the amils of the neighbourhood, the lease of all such villages as had fallen out of cultivation, or in which the revenue was from any cause collected with difficulty. He also acquired a great portion of the estates held by the heirs of Bhoj Singh. Phup Singh was expelled from the Murs\u00e1n estate by Surajmal, the J\u00e1t Raja of Bhartpur, in 1757, and retired to S\u00e1sni, over which he acquired complete authority. He recovered possession of Murs\u00e1n in 1761, but was again expelled by Naj\u00ed Kh\u00e1n in 1776. He did not again occupy Murs\u00e1n until 1785, and it was some years before he recovered all the talukas that he formerly held. Shortly before his death he relinquished the management of the estate to his son Bhagwant Singh. Phup Singh was the first of his family to assume the title of Raja. His acquisitions were the greater part of taluka Moheriya, talukas Rohi, Bisana or Lashkarpur, Kotha Patta, Chotwa and Tuks\u00e1n, and about seventeen single villages.\n\nBhagwant Singh obtained entire control of the estate on the death of his father in 1798 A.D. He added talukas Sonk and Madan to it in 1795, and taluka Dunaitiya in 1796. In 1808 he was allowed to engage for the whole of the estates held by him, and in the engagement papers is styled zamind\u00e1r in some places, talukad\u00e1r in others, and farmer in others. On this point the Collector seems to have been guided by the leases which the Raja had received from the former Government. At the close of the year 1215 fasil\u00ed (1807-8 A.D.) a lease was granted to him for his own life, at a fixed revenue of Rs. 80,000, for the whole estate, exclusive of talukas Sonk and Madan, which were granted to him in r\u00e9j for good service performed in Lord Lake\u2019s campaign. The following table shows the descent of the Murs\u00e1n family from Makan to Raja Tikam Singh, C.S.I., the present representative. The r\u00e9j has always descended to the eldest son, but the collateral branches are entitled to be maintained by the Raja of the time being.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 Mr. Thornton gives a full table of the collateral branches of the family in Set. Rep. I., 345.\nNo investigation was made in 1803 with regard to the internal circumstances of the taluka, nor was the Raja's management in any way controlled or interfered with until the death of Bhagwant Singh. During this interval several individuals petitioned for the recovery or the maintenance of their rights in particular villages, but they appear to have been all referred to a future opportunity for the investigation of their claims. Bhagwant Singh could not resist the example of his brother J\u00e1t, Daya R\u00e1m, and joined with the latter in setting at nought the orders of the civil courts; but on the fall of H\u00e1thras he surrendered and consented to dismantle his own fort of Murs\u00e1n. Raja Bhagwant Singh died in 1823, leaving a son, Tikam Singh, and the whole of his estates were held under direct management by the Collector for the year 1823-24. All persons who considered themselves to possess rights as being the descendants of those who were the original zamind\u00e1rs previous to the annexation of their respective villages to the parganah, as well as those who only rested their claims on long residence and management, came forward and prayed for the protection of Government. In the settlement for 1232-36 fasli (1824-25 to 1828-29 A.D.), all these claimants were permitted to engage for their respective villages with the title of mukadams, and those villages in which no claimant came forward were left with the farmers. Tikam Singh was declared the sudder malguzar or principal engager for the revenue, and was given a malik\u00e1na allowance of fifteen per cent. on the land revenue paid by those who engaged for each village, besides a sum of Rs. 644 per mensum on account of expenses of collection. Between 1232 and 1237 fasli, Tikam Singh lost nearly a lakh of rupees by this arrangement, and this led to a summary settlement in 1238, conducted on the former system of allowing Tikam Singh to collect only a fixed sum from each village, on which he received malik\u00e1na. Farmers were again selected for those villages to the management of which there existed no rightful claimant, and security was demanded from each one admitted to engage; but bad seasons and insufficient security were again said to be a cause of loss to the Raja.\n\nIn 1832-34, when Mr. John Thornton was appointed to revise the settlement of the district, the Murs\u00e1n estate comprised some 300\u00bd villages, of which 231 were hamlets dependent on parent villages. These had all been drawn from time to time from parganahs Jalesar, Sadabad, Mah\u00e1ban, R\u00e1ya and Koil, and were then distributed amongst eighteen talukas, each consisting for the most part of a parent village with its surrounding hamlets. Taluka Moheriya contained several minor talukas which had become obsolete through the extinction of the original settlers, and one other comprised all the villages not in the other talukas. Mr. Thornton's first care was to \"discover in what villages there existed individuals or communities who were entitled to retain the management under the Raja, and to\n\n---\n\n1 Board's Records, 7th April, 1815.\ndetermine the relation in which the two parties should stand towards each other.\" Mr. Thornton's remarks on the formation of the taluka so well apply to the other talukas of this district, that I shall give his conclusions in his own words. He writes:\u2014\"I have found that in about two-thirds of parganah Murs\u00e1n, the descendants of the original zam\u00ednd\u00e1rs who held the villages before they came under the Raja's authority are still forthcoming, and that neither by their own act, nor by the will of the former Government, have they forfeited their right of managing their respective estates as long as they shall pay the revenue demanded from them. With the exception of the three talukas of Sonk, Madan, and Dunaitiya, it was not even alleged by the Raja that the rights of the original zam\u00ednd\u00e1rs had been transferred to his ancestors in any legal manner; but he relied upon the assertion that the descendants of those zam\u00ednd\u00e1rs were extinct, and that the ancestors of the present claimants had been located by his predecessors as common cultivators. This assertion, however, was in itself vague and improbable; it was supported by no proof, and opposed to all evidence, oral or documentary. The holders of the several villages give a clear and credible account of their descent and past history, which is attested by all those who could be supposed to have any knowledge on the subject. Their rights were acknowledged by the former Government when opportunity offered, as is proved by some original papers from the office of the parganah registrar (kantingo) of the latter part of the last century. By these papers, it appears that during the time that Raja Phup Singh was expelled from his estate, the ancestors of the present village occupants were recorded by the Government of the time as zam\u00ednd\u00e1rs or mukadams (for the terms appear to have been used indiscriminately) of their respective villages. Even during the life of the late Raja Bhagwant Singh the management of the land was left to these men, except when some reason presented itself to the contrary. All others were called farmers (mustajire); and even when any village was leased out to an individual of the latter class, the hereditary village occupants frequently continued to hold as kitkinadars under him, and if totally deprived of the management, they still retained their seer land, which they repeatedly mortgaged as necessity occurred. These points, taken together and combined with the total absence of proof on the other side, form as strong evidence as can generally be looked for in inquiries of this nature. But in Murs\u00e1n the assertion of the Raja is still more powerfully refuted by the circumstances of the cases themselves, and particularly by the formation of the talukas mentioned above. No race of mere tenants-at-will could have obtained the sole occupancy of a large tract; caused by such occupancy the villages which arose therein to be so connected as to be termed a taluka; divided that taluka from a remote period into separate portions, each known by the name of one of the early members of the family; held each of those portions distinct to the present day;\nsettled their several shares without dispute as soon as they were allowed to engage in 1825-26; and finally procured the sanction and the testimony of the neighbouring inhabitants to their claim of being the parties to whom, under whatever superior, the right of cultivating and managing the soil belongs. In the three talukas above mentioned, the Raja allowed the descent of the present mukadams from the original zamindars, but rested his claim for their expulsion from the management on the plea that their ancestors had sold them to his father, Bhagwant Singh, in return for his discharging some arrears of revenue due to the Government of the time. But it appeared, upon examination, that these transactions were rather between the amils and Bhagwant Singh than between the Raja and the zamindars, or at all events, that the inconsiderable number of the latter who were present at the time, contemplated nothing more than the annexation of their villages to the parganah and the consequent transfer of their future payments from the amil to the Raja. I have, therefore, admitted to engagements all those who have established their descent from the original zamindars, and who consequently inherit rights which existed at a period anterior to the Raja's authority. Those who have derived their tenures from the Raja himself, or his ancestors, have been directed to apply to the same quarter for their renewal. In about one-third of the parganah the stock of the old zamindars was extinct, and these villages have, in consequence, been made over to the exclusive management of the Raja, with the title of zamindar.\n\nA similar course has been pursued with regard to a few villages, in which the rightful occupants have been prevailed upon, by certain equivalents, to withdraw their claims of every kind in favour of the sudder malguzar.\"\n\nThose villages which were settled with the Raja, under the title of zamindar, in consequence of the absence of other claimants, were classed as zamindari. Those which were settled solely with the Raja, on account of the refusal of the village occupants, were termed talukadari, and the remaining villages settled with the village communities were classed under mukadami (see parganah Mursak). The Raja made every effort in the civil courts to obtain a reversal of Mr. Thornton's proceedings but without effect. During the currency of Mr. Thornton's settlement, Raja Tikam Singh held his own amid the fall of all around him. Notwithstanding his dissatisfaction with the changes made by Mr. Thornton, the Raja proved a staunch friend to the British during the troubles of 1857, and was rewarded with the decoration of 'Companion of the Star of India,' the proprietorship of several large villages, such as Gonda in Igl\u00e4s and others, and the remission of the revenue of five villages, assessed at Rs. 6,550 per annum, for two generations. Though in debt, he is not embarrassed, and will leave to his\n\n---\n\n1 In 1846, the Raja instituted 57 civil suits in the local courts to contest Mr. Thornton's proceedings, all of which, except five, which were compromised, were dismissed in appeal to the superior courts.\u2014Hutchinson, 140.\nson and grandson one of the finest estates in all the surrounding country. He is of fearless and independent character, and commands the respect of all who know him. Raja Tikam Singh is an honorary magistrate of the district.\n\nMr. Thornton, with his final proceedings, drew up a set of rules for preventing any doubt or uncertainty in future as to the relations between the two parties that he found in the parganah. First, as regards the village occupants, the following principles were formulated:\n\n1. I consider them entitled to retain the management of their respective villages as long as they shall pay the land revenue which may be settled by the Collector at any revision of the settlement as that which the Raja is to obtain from them. This land revenue shall at least be so moderate as to be paid easily in an average year, in order that even in case of an unfavourable season, the malguzars may be able to make arrangements for its liquidation.\n\n2. If they shall at any time be deprived of the management on account of refusing to engage at the time of settlement, or on account of balances afterwards due from them, they shall retain the lands which are in their own seer cultivation, and shall not be called upon to pay more for the same than the rates fixed at the time of settlement.\n\n3. In all such cases of dispossession, they shall be allowed the option of recovering the management at any ensuing settlement, provided they then discharge the arrears due from them, in cases where failure in paying the revenue may have been the cause of their deprivation.\n\n4. They shall be termed 'biswadars,' and their representatives 'mukadam biswadars.'\n\n5. Whenever the holders of any thok or patti, the revenue of which is separate from that of the remainder of the village, shall fall into balances, the holders of the other thoks shall have the option of taking it into their own hands upon discharging the balance, and of holding it as mortgagees till they shall have been repaid the amount.\n\n6. The abovementioned rights shall be considered to be hereditary and transferable, that is to say, while in possession of management they may transfer their share or interest, and, when dispossessed, their seer land, subject to the payment of the settlement rates.\n\nSecondly, as regards the Raja\u2014\n\n1. The Raja being established by length of possession as sudder malguzar of the parganah, is entitled to the difference between the revenue required by the State from each village and the sum which it may fix that he shall receive from the village communities. It follows that if the Government demand should at any time be pressed to the utmost extent that each village can regularly pay, his\ninterest will cease in the villages settled with the mukadams, or remain in abeyance, though the revenue may still be paid through his hands.\n\n2. When the malguzars of any village may fail to pay their revenue in any year, the Raja shall sue them before the Collector, and after establishing his claim, if neither they nor their securities shall discharge the balance, he shall be entitled to make his own arrangements for the future management. He shall also assume the management in cases when the mukadams may decline engaging on the terms proposed at the time of settlement.\n\n3. Whenever the descendants of the old zamindars, who have now been recorded as biswadars, shall become extinct in any village, the Raja shall succeed to their rights and title in the same manner as he has now been allowed to succeed to the original occupants in those estates which have been settled with him as zamindar.\n\n4. As long as the abovementioned descendants continue to exist, and are forthcoming on the spot to assert their claims to the occupancy of the soil, the Raja shall, in such villages, retain the appellation of talukadar.\n\n5. The talukadari rights which the Raja has been above described to possess shall be considered to be hereditary and transferable. His successor will be of course in exactly the same position with respect to the village malguzars as has now been assigned to himself.\"\n\nAs has been seen, taluka Beswan owes its origin to Nawal Singh, eldest brother of Daya Ram, who, when worsted in the contest with his energetic younger brother, retired to Beswan, which with 26 other villages had been set apart for his maintenance during the life of Bhuri Singh, his father. Nawal Singh does not appear to have ever taken any measures to press his claims to the Hathras estate by right of seniority. He was succeeded by his two sons, Jiwa Ram and Harkishan. The former received Beswan and the estate connected with it, partly in jagir and partly on a fixed revenue for life, and the latter shared with him.1 Harkishan was succeeded by his son Jaikishan or Jaikishor, who, on the downfall of Hathras, obtained the grant of taluka Shahzadpur, formed partly from Hathras and partly from Mendu. Jaikishan was succeeded by Girdhar Singh and Gir Parahad; the latter still holds Beswan and Shahzadpur. Jiwa Ram having previously squandered, through extravagance and folly, much not only of his paternal possessions but also of taluka Mendu, granted to him in 1817, died in 1835. He left five sons, and was succeeded by the eldest, Randhir Singh, who has succeeded in retaining but little of the family property. From the genealogical table given on a preceding page it will be seen that\n\n1 Board's Records, 29th September, 1809, No. 30; 18th November, 1809, No. 8; 30th December, 1809, No. 13; 24th March, 1818, No. 4; 5th May, 1918, No. 7; 3rd July, 1818, No. 9; 11th August, 1861, No. 8.\nJaswant Singh, one of the sons of Nand R\u00e1m, had three sons\u2014Subha R\u00e1m, Bairis\u00e1l, and Tej Singh. The two latter received Tochigarh, whilst Subha R\u00e1m obtained a few villages in Tappa Jo\u00e1r. In the troublous times of Muhammad Sh\u00e1h, Subha R\u00e1m increased his possessions, and his son Umed Singh, during the J\u00e1t usurpation (1757 to 1775), succeeded in obtaining the lease of a considerable tract of country. On the accession of Najaf Kh\u00e1n to power, Umed Singh was dispossessed (1775) and his farm was given in j\u00e1gir to one Rustam Beg Kh\u00e1n, who held it until the arrival of the Marhattas in 1785. Umed Singh then recovered possession and divided the taluka with his nephews, Shiu Singh and S\u00e1hib Singh, sons of Sumer Singh. One share was called Kanka and the other Kajraut. Both have since been more than once subdivided. In 1792 the talukas were given in j\u00e1gir to a Marhatta named Gul\u00e1bji Kadam, who remained in possession until a short time before the conquest. The J\u00e1ts were then again admitted to engage and settlements were made with Nih\u00e1l Singh, son of Umed Singh, Shiu Singh and Kishan Singh, son of Sumer Singh, in 1805-06, and continued with them until 1836. Mr. Thornton at the revision found that the talukad\u00e1rs had so thoroughly exterminated the old proprietors that he could only restore four villages to the real owners, the Jangh\u00e1ra Rajputs. The following table shows all that is necessary concerning this family up to the last settlement:\n\n```\nJaswant Singh.\n  Subha R\u00e1m.\n    Umed Singh.\n      Umar.\n        Nih\u00e1l.\n          Naubat Girdhar, Takar\u00e1n.\n            Randh\u00ed and 5 others.\n      Khushal.\n        Khushal.\n          Hardeo, Khel.\n            Randh\u00ed and 5 others.\n      Suja\u00edn.\n        Khushal.\n          Jaw\u00e1hir.\n            Pirthi.\n              Dharm.\n                Khaborl.\n                  Ganga Bakhsh.\n```\n\nThe shares of Pirthi and Dharm, sons of Shiu Singh, have been alienated, those of several others have been mortgaged, and the talukas, for all purposes, have now been broken up and separate interests have been created.\n\nThe J\u00e1ts of the Ch\u00e1bak got hold taluka Pis\u00e1wa. They first obtained a footing in the district by Mukhr\u00e1m, their leader, undertaking the lease of Pis\u00e1wa and the neighbouring villages from Perron. At Mr. Elliot\u2019s assessment Mukhr\u00e1m was dispossessed of all the villages except taluka Pis\u00e1wa, and the real proprietors were allowed to engage. Taluka Pis\u00e1wa itself was settled by Mr. Sterling in 1833 for twenty years. Mukhr\u00e1m Singh was succeeded by Bharat Singh, and he by his three sons, Tej Singh, Shib Singh, and Gobind Singh. Like most others of\nthe influential J\u0101ts, the proprietors of P\u012bs\u0101wa sided with the British during the mutiny of 1857 and received a few villages as reward. They have increased their paternal possessions by purchase, but of late years have shown a grasping, quarrelsome disposition, and their \"constant disputes with their own tenants and the neighbouring zamindars have, to a certain extent, impaired the general good estimation in which they were formerly held.\"\n\nThe Pundirs or Purirs of N\u0101i, represented by Th\u0101kur Kundan Singh,\n\nPundirs of N\u0101i.\n\nreceived two villages in reward for their service during the mutiny. Mr. Bramly writes:\u2014\"Kundan Singh's estates are small, but his influence in his clan is great. His presence in the neighbourhood of Sikandra Rao continually served as a check to the Muhammadan population of that town, who never dared to do any overt act of rebellion without the help and screen of rebel troops, on whom they could afterwards throw the blame. During the month of June and a portion of July, the Tahsildar, though his functions were entirely in abeyance, still was allowed to live in the town without molestation. During this time the only two men who visited him, or showed him any countenance, were Kundan Singh and Debi Parshad, Baniya. After the departure of Mr. Watson for Agra, the Tahsildar, being no longer safe in the town, took shelter with Kundan Singh. In the end of August, after the defeat of Ghaus Kh\u00e1n's followers near Koil, Kundan Singh having been made Nazim of the Parganah, entered the town of Sikandra Rao with a body of some 1,500 of his own followers, reinstated the Tahsildar, and maintained him in that position till our authority was thoroughly established. I have always heard Kundan Singh well spoken of as an upright man. He is one of the best specimens of the home-bred, untravelled Rajput I have ever met.\"\n\nRaja Pirthi Singh, the adopted son of the late Pitambar Singh of Awa Misa,\n\nPirthi Singh of Awa Misa.\n\nin the Muttra District, in common with many other members of the spurious offshoots of the great Jadon stock, claims kinship with the Jadons of the Karauli State, but his claim is not allowed by any of the pure Jadava families. His history will be given under the Muttra District. The family is noticed here as having acquired of late years talukas Daryapur and Husain, which belonged to the Porach Rajputs, and the greater portion of the Bijaigarh taluka, which belonged to the Pundir Rajputs. The Awa family are more money-lenders than landholders, and have always proved severe and grasping landlords. They are now the largest single owners in the Sikandra Tahsil.\n\nTalukas D\u0101tauli and Bhamauri N\u0101h are held by a clan of Sarwani Afghans\n\nAfghans of D\u0101tauli.\n\nwho settled here some two hundred years ago. One of their leaders, Muhammad Mir Kh\u00e1n, obtained possession of D\u0101tauli in the reign of Akbar. Abdul Rahman Kh\u00e1n increased the ancestral\npossessions considerably by the purchase of estates at sales for arrears of revenue during the early years of British rule, and was succeeded by his son, Muhammad Husain Khan. The latter died soon after signing the engagement papers at the settlement in 1838, and was succeeded by his brother, Faiz Ahmad Khan, then only twelve years of age. The estate was placed under the management of Muhammad Daud Khan, one of the talukadars of Bhamauri Nah, whose sister had married Abdul Rahman Khan, and whose daughter had married Muhammad Husain Khan, and so well was it managed that specie enough was accumulated to complete the purchase money of the valuable Malikpur estate in the Bulandshahr district from the assignees of Mercer and Co., indigo-planters. Datali now consists of 25 villages, paying a revenue of Rs. 30,246, and situated in the most fertile portion of the parganah. Malikpur contains 32 villages, all of which will descend to the eldest son according to the custom of the family.\n\nTaluka Bhamauri was acquired by Afghans of the same stock, named Yusaf and Sulaiman, during the reign of Shahjahan. They resided at Bhikampur, which now frequently gives its name to the family. They added considerably to their possessions, but were twice ejected, once by the Bharatpur Jats in 1757 A.D., and again by Indurgir Gosain, who during the government of Najaf Khan established a temporary supremacy in these parganahs. Nah was originally held by Megdwar Rajputs who were dispossessed by the Jats, and their lands were given to Baz Khan by De Boigne in 1793-94 A.D. The grant was confirmed by the British Government in 1808, and the two talukas were joined together under the name of Bhamauri Nah. In 1856 they comprised 61 villages, paying a revenue of Rs. 42,313. Baz Khan had three sons\u2014Muhammad Khan, Khanzaman Khan, and Daud Khan, who divided the estates between them. Hadi Yar Khan, the son of Muhammad Khan, now owns one-third, and has taken up his residence at Dedon. Khanzaman's share has been divided into three smaller talukas,\u2014two held by his sons, Abdul Shakir Khan and Muhammad Taki Khan, and one by his grandson. Daud Khan's share again has been equally divided between his two sons, Inayatullah Khan and Ghulam Ahmad Khan. In spite of these subdivisions each member of the family still retains a considerable property. Hadi Yar Khan holds 32 villages in Aligarh and the large estate of Mohanpur in Eta. Abdul Shakir Khan and his brother and nephew hold 48 villages in Aligarh and several estates in Eta, and the sons of Daud Khan hold 15 villages each, besides estates in the adjoining district. During the mutiny Daud Khan's conduct was very suspicious. Mr. Sapte writes that he refused to furnish supplies to the Bulandshahr force on their way to Eta, and \"for two days we were put to great inconvenience, and his personal bearing towards us was disrespectful in the extreme. Of the movements and intentions of the rebels at Kasganj he feigned complete ignorance, though his house was but a few miles from that town.\" If he\nhad been, as he professed, a well-wisher of the British, he must have felt anxiety for himself if the rebels had advanced, but his conduct plainly showed that he was under no apprehension from them.\"\n\nA branch of the Badg\u00fajar family converted to Isl\u00e1m by S\u00e1bit Kh\u00e1n, the well-known Governor of Koil in the beginning of the last century, owns taluka Chak\u00e1thal. They claim descent from D\u00e1n Sah\u00e1i, a lineal descendant of Part\u00e1p Singh, and in the last century, R\u00fap Singh the son, and T\u00e1ra Singh the grandson, of D\u00e1n Sah\u00e1i became converts to Isl\u00e1m. T\u00e1ra Singh died in 1811, and his widow, Mah\u00e1 Kunwar, succeeded to the property. Mah\u00e1 Kunwar died in 1859. During her life, Nitanand, the father of Jaw\u00e1l\u00e1 Baksh, Brahman, a servant of the estate, induced her to transfer it to him. On the death of Mah\u00e1 Kunwar, her sister Ratta Kunwar succeeded and contested the transfer to the Brahmans. The case was recently decided in the Privy Council adversely to her. One-fourth of the remainder was decreed to be the property of Ar\u00e1m Singh, the grandson of a cousin of T\u00e1ra Singh. Ratta Kunwar has made over all her rights to M\u00e1zh\u00fak Ali Kh\u00e1n, the son of her daughter. The death of Ratta Kunwar will be the signal for another appeal to the Courts, and there are grave doubts whether the estate can stand the expense. The converted Badg\u00fajars of Taluka Pilkhana also belonged to the S\u00e1bitkh\u00e1n\u00ed family, but their importance ended with the sale of the taluka by auction in 1815, when it was purchased by Mard\u00e1n Ali Kh\u00e1n.\n\nTaluka Barauli is held by a family of Badg\u00fajar Rajputs who claim to be the eldest branch of the clan settled in this and the Bulandshahr Districts (see BULANDSHAHR DISTRICT).\n\nEven at the last settlement five villages were mortgaged and the estate was sadly neglected. The zamind\u00e1rs were idle and extravagant and deeply involved in debt, and by 1856 one-half of the villages had passed into the hands of the Musalm\u00e1n Badg\u00fajars of Pah\u00e1su, Pindr\u00e1wal, and Chat\u00e1ri in the Bulandshahr District. The present owner, Rao Karan Singh, has increased the debt by a protracted litigation concerning his right to one-half the estate. The suit has been decided by the Privy Council in his favour, and if he only pays attention to his estate, there can be no doubt that he will eventually be able to clear off the present incumbrances, as Barauli has been much improved of late years by the canal. The families of Muhammad Ali Kh\u00e1n of Chat\u00e1ri, B\u00e1kir Ali Kh\u00e1n of Pindr\u00e1wal, and Faiz Ali Kh\u00e1n of Pah\u00e1su, are noticed in the account of the Bulandshahr District. They are Musalm\u00e1n Badg\u00fajars, and have acquired by purchase considerable estates in this district.\n\nThe Somna taluka belongs to J\u00e1don Rajputs\u00b9 of the B\u00e1gr\u00ed got. The taluka belonged to Chauh\u00e1n Rajputs\u00b2 but in the troubled times of Marhatta rule, during the last decade of the eighteenth\n\n\u00b9 Board's Records, 31st August, 1822, No. 7. \u00b2 Settlement Report, 345; Board's Records.\ncentury, Jair\u00e1m Singh, of the Jadon clan, obtained the farm of the taluka from General Perron. Though he appears to have had no sufficient title to the proprietary right in most of the villages of the taluka, the settlement of 1803 and successive settlements were made with him as zamind\u00e1r until his death in 1826. Before his death, two of his collateral relatives, Khush\u00e1l Singh and R\u00e1mparsh\u00e1d, sued for and obtained a share in the estate, and the remainder was divided amongst his three sons, Hira Singh, Chandan Singh, and Balwant Singh. At the revision of settlement Mr. Thornton found that he could not restore the original zam\u00ednd\u00e1rs, as they had been so long out of the management of their estates, and he found that their exclusion was mainly due to the policy adopted by Jair\u00e1m, who used his utmost endeavours to keep the old zam\u00ednd\u00e1rs satisfied with his management of the estate. To the few J\u00e1t communities he granted indulgences which left them the entire management of their villages, and so stopped them from engaging in a doubtful contest to prove their undoubted rights, whilst the Chauh\u00e1ns were allowed certain privileges which sufficed for their support. His sons, however, pursued a different course. They not only deprived the original proprietors of every privilege granted to them by Jair\u00e1m, but those men who were weak enough to trust to Rajp\u00fat honour were not even allowed to reside within the limits of the taluks; and so the injustice done by the nature of the early summary settlements was allowed to continue by the arbitrary, though salutary, influence of our limitation laws. All these brothers are now dead. Balwant Singh alienated his portion of the estate through extravagance. The widow of Hira Singh is still alive and in possession of her husband's share. Chandan Singh died childless, leaving an estate largely increased by judicious purchases to his two widows and his adopted son. One of the widows now manages the estate.\n\nJal\u00e1li is noticeable for a family of Sayyids who have settled here from the time of Ala-ud-din, when Sayyid Kam\u00e1l-ud-d\u00edn married the daughter of the K\u00e1zi. In the time of Shahjah\u00e1n they expelled the original Path\u00e1n proprietors. They have supplied a large number of men who have attained to considerable distinction in the civil and military service of the State. (See Jal\u00e1li.)\n\nTaluka Husain was acquired by Raja Ratan Singh of the Porach tribe of Rajp\u00fats, about 1760, shortly after his expulsion from Taluka Husain. Mendu and H\u00e1thras by the J\u00e1ts. Ratan Singh retired to Farukhabad and subsequently acquired the favour of Nawal Singh of Bhartpur, who, in 1770, gave him a j\u00e1tir and allowed him to engage for taluka Husain. The taluka had, originally, been farmed by one Muhammad Sh\u00e1kir, who had been allowed to withdraw certain villages from Parganah Jalesar and to hold them as farmer, but about seven years before Ratan Singh obtained the taluka, the Musalm\u00e1n had been expelled and the village proprietors had again paid direct to the Jalesar amil. Neither Ratan Singh nor his predecessors had\never before had any portion of the taluka beyond a few houses in Husain Kh\u00e1s. The arrangement in favour of Ratan Singh continued in force only until 1786, when the dominion of the Marhattas commenced. Ratan Singh died in 1787 and was succeeded by his son Mitrsen, who was deprived of the taluka. Husain was then made over to an Afgh\u00e1n named Kotal Kh\u00e1n, and afterwards in jdedd\u00e1 to B\u00e1p\u00faji Sindhia. It subsequently formed a portion of Perron and DeBoigne's possessions, who collected the revenue separately from each village. So that from 1786 to 1803 the Raja retained no portion of the estate except three revenue-free villages. During the confusion of the earlier years of our government Mitrsen found means to have himself admitted to engage for the taluka, and from 1803-04 to 1807-08 he was entered as the chief engager for the revenue. In the latter year, in consequence of the indebtedness of Mitrsen,\u00b9 the old proprietors were recorded, and it was directed that engagements should be taken from them, but the settlement was again made with the Raja as farmer on his giving security, and was continued to his son Jaswant Singh and grandson Nar\u00e1yan Singh. Mr. Thornton revised the settlement in 1836, and found that the taluka consisted of forty revenue-paying and three revenue-free estates, held by the Raja on a conditional and temporary lease, without prejudice to the rightful owners; but in only 17 villages could these owners be found, and the remainder of the taluka was settled with the Raja as proprietor. Nar\u00e1yan Singh mortgaged his rights to Pirthi Singh of Awa Misa, in the Muttra District, and on his death in 1846 was succeeded by his two widows as heirs. His malik\u00e9d allowance, in accordance with rule, was reduced to ten per cent. on the land assessment, and a pension of Rs. 600 per annum was allowed to each of his widows. They brought a suit for redemption against the mortgagees, and obtained a decree in the lower Courts, which was reversed on appeal. The J\u00e1don talukad\u00e1r of Awa Misa is now in possession, and the only member of the old family now living is the childless widow of Nar\u00e1yan Singh.\u00b2 Taluka Dary\u00e1pur, another old possession of the Porach Rajp\u00fats, was the head-quarters of the Raja who first assisted Nandr\u00e1m, the ancestor of the H\u00e1thras and Murs\u00e1n families; his descendants retained possession until the last settlement, when they borrowed money from the Raja of Awa Misa, who is now in possession of their estates.\n\nTaluka Igl\u00e1s was held under the Marhatta Government by one Gangadhar Pandit as a grant for religious and charitable purposes, and it was confirmed to him by the British Government. On his death the grant was resumed, and in 1816\u00b3 one-fourth of the\n\n\u00b9 Board's Records, 23rd May, 1809; No. 11; 16th June, 1809, No. 14; 4th July, 1809, No. 35; 11th July, 1809, No. 39; 29th September, 1809, No. 33; 17th November, 1802, No. 19. \u00b2 G.

The entire revenue from the eleven villages of the taluka is paid into the treasury, and the public three-fourths now go to make up part of the endowment of the Agra College. The revenue assessed at the present settlement is Rs. 7,740 per annum, of which the Agra College gets Rs. 5,805 and the heirs of Gangadhar the remainder.\n\nTaluka Gambhira, more commonly known as Bijaigarh, in the old Parganah Taluka Gambhira or Jalali, and Tahsil Sikandra Rao, belongs to an old family Bijaiagarh of Pundir Rajputs, who formerly held the greater portion of Parganahs Akabad and Sikandra Rao. Rao Manik Singh was expelled by the Jat-Marhatta Government, and his taluka was given to Raja Bhagwant Singh of Mursan. The fort of Bijaigarh was taken, after great loss, by the Commander-in-Chief in 1802. The graves of those who fell in the attack are in the low dhuar lands below the fort. In 1805-06 Rao Manik Singh was admitted to engage for the revenue, and was succeeded by his son Khawan Singh, with whom the settlement under Regulation IX. of 1833 was made and whose extravagance and weakness ruined the estate. In 1838 Khawan Singh mortgaged the taluka to Man Singh, a banker of Koil, who in 1840 sub-mortgaged it to Mr. J. O'B. Saunders, at that time an indigo-planter in this district. In 1852 Khawan Singh obtained a decree in the local Courts for redemption of the mortgage, but this was reversed by the Sadr Diwani in 1853. Khawan Singh died the same year, leaving as his heirs his widow, Baldeo Kunwar, a son, Balwant Singh, only four years of age, and his mother, Jai Kunwar. He left the estate encumbered with debt to the amount of Rs. 75,000. The taluka originally contained 32 villages, of which eight were sold prior to the revision of settlement in 1838, and thirteen were sold subsequently. Balwant Singh now holds only eleven villages, most of which are small. \"He would appear to have accepted the warning taught by the ruinous excesses of his father, and limits his expenditure by the reduced amount of his income.\" The new settlement has enhanced the demand on his villages, but with ordinary prudence he ought to be able to pay the increased land-revenue without difficulty.\n\nParganah Sikandra Rao was originally composed of talukas Agsoli, Deori, Pora, and Naukhail. After the cession, taluka Agsoli was farmed to Hurmat Ali Khan, and the other talukas to Muhammad Nur Khan, both residents of Sikandra Rao. In 1809 the farm of Agsoli was discontinued, and the villages of the taluka were settled with the several zamindars; but at the special request of the real proprietors of the remaining talukas, Nur Khan was allowed to continue as farmer. In 1810 the tahsildar absconded, and Nur Khan became bankrupt. The Government took Nur\n\n---\n\n1 See Board's Records, 16th July, 1814, No. 4; 2nd August, 1814, No. 7; 29th September, 1818, No. 6.\n2 Board's Records, 24th June, 1809, No. 26; 19th July, 1809, No. 12.\nKh\u00e1n's fort of Deori in part payment of his arrears, and the three talukas were broken up and the villages were separately settled with the old proprietors.\n\nMajor Louis Derridon was an officer in the Marhatta service, whose sister married M. Perron. Perron held the village of Bhamola in jdyir by sanad from Sindhia and by a farm\u00e1n of Shah Alam. After leaving the Marhatta service he made over his jdyir to his brother-in-law by deed of gift, dated Chinsurah, June 11th, 1804. Major Derridon refused to give up this village to the British, and was ejected by force, but was afterwards reinstated. Part of the village being subsequently required for cantonments, the village of Dodhpur and half of Alampur were given in exchange for Bhamola on a revenue-free tenure to Major Derridon and his heirs for ever (October 13th, 1821). Major Derridon died in 1845, and his estate was divided amongst his heirs, most of whom are now in comparatively poor circumstances. Alampur has been sold and is now in the hands of Mahm\u00fad Ali Kh\u00e1n of Chat\u00e1ri, and the greater portion of the interests in Bhamola and Dodhpur has been lost to the family. Those left of the family reside in Agra.\n\nAmongst the minor estates in this district may be mentioned taluka Raipur in Parganah Atrauli, which formerly belonged to a family of Musalm\u00e1n Rajp\u00fats, but before the mutiny it passed into the hands of a Baniya of Atrauli, the Afgh\u00e1ns of Bhamauri N\u00e1h, and other creditors. Similarly, taluka Lohgarh was purchased by a servant of the Barla indigo factory, and taluka Sahnaul came into the hands of one Khushwakt Ali, son of one Waz\u00edr Irsh\u00e1d Ali of Cawnpore. Taluka Badesra fell into the hands of the J\u00e1t\u00eds of Kuchchesar in the Bulandshahr district. In Parganah Koil, talukas \u00c1isa and Manchaura, belonging to M\u00edr Mahar Ali, and taluka Sikh\u00e1ran, belonging to Hak\u00edm Zulfak\u00e1r Ali, have been broken up: the former in 1810 and the latter in 1816. Taluka Sukraw\u00e1l\u00ed, in the same parganah, has been divided amongst the heirs of Nandr\u00e1m J\u00e1t, who acquired the estate at the first settlement. Taluka S\u00e1hibabad belonged to a Kayath family who held the hereditary kan\u00fangoship of the parganah. They founded Keshopur, Gadr\u00e1ns, and Gambhirpur, but the latter village subsequently passed into the hands of the adopted sons of M\u00e1n Singh, a well-known banker of Koil. The Chauh\u00e1ns of B\u00e9manti, in Parganah Khair, formerly held the whole of the parganah. Rao Pirthi Singh was dispossessed by Perron, and on the British occupation, Rao Lachhman Singh, son of Pirthi Singh, obtained certain allowances which terminated with his death. Lachhman Singh was succeeded by Hira\n\n---\n\n1 Board's Records, 24th January, 1806, Nos. 3-5; 18th February, 1806; 24th June, 1806, No. 2; 28th October, 1806; 26th June, 1807, No. 1; 8th November, 1808, No. 32; 8th June 1821, No. 7.\nSingh, and he by Bhupal Singh, who attacked and plundered Khair in 1857. He was subsequently captured and hanged. The bankers of Duchita, in Khair, have also large possessions in the parganah.\n\nAll proprietary tenures fall under one or other of the three great classes already explained, viz., zamindari, pattidari, and bhayachara. Of the 2,046 estates or mahals, including those held free of revenue, 1,064, or 52 per cent., are zamindari; 854, or 42 per cent., are bhayachara; and 128, or 6 per cent., are pattidari. Both these latter tenures indicate the existence of numerous co-sharers and mostly of cultivating communities, and, on the other hand, zamindari tenures are often confined to a single owner, though in the majority of cases there are here also several co-sharers. Counting the two latter classes as one, it will be found that the whole district is pretty equally divided between small village communities and those who are, in some cases, the possessors of considerable property. Cases of perfect pattidari with complete division of the land and joint responsibility are few and exceptional; for once separation is complete the holders prefer to remain unfettered and to erect their shares into distinct estates. But a very considerable number exhibit a combination, or rather a commixture, of the two former systems, partial separation and partial union in one and the same village, the division being founded on hereditary right, or (specially when the proprietary body is numerous and the lands tilled by the sharers) depending on ability to cultivate and to pay the recognized bakh. In Iglas and Khair villages of this kind constitute more than half the entire number; in Hathras they are 168 out of a total of 400, and in Koil they number 202 out of 412 estates. Zamindari estates are most numerous in Atrauli and Sikandra Rao.\n\nNo description of tenures would be complete without a reference to that condition of landed property known as the talukadari, which prevails to a considerable extent in Iglas and Hathras, and in which there are two distinct classes of proprietors\u2014the superior and inferior. This was the subject that engaged the attention of Mr. J. Thornton in 1838, and he was the first to grasp the real nature of these holdings and lay down the principles on which they should be dealt with by the State. The Mughal conquerors, and, in imitation of them, their Marhatta successors, seem to have applied the term zamindar to all those from whom they received the revenue, whether of a large tract or a single village, provided the tenure of such persons was of a permanent nature. Thus, when Phup Singh was expelled from Mursan, the ancestors of the present village proprietors enjoyed the same title as the ousted Raja. It is clear, therefore, that the term 'zamindar' was never intended, at that time, to convey or express a right to the occupancy in the soil itself. In the district held by the larger zamindars, the land was\n\n1 See page 222. 2 Thornton's Mursan Report: I., Settlement Report, 247.\nstill retained by those to whom it belonged before the appointment of any permanent officer between them and the State, and who were emphatically termed 'bhumiyas,' as being indissolubly connected with the soil; and although these large zamindars were frequently enabled, by the apathy of the native governments, and especially of an usurping power like the Marhattas, to encroach upon the rights of those whom they were bound, by the terms of all their leases, to protect, the condemnation of such tyranny by the general voice of the country was sufficient to prove that in so doing they exceeded the power entrusted to them. If, then, the title of zamindar had still retained its original meaning, Mr. Thornton considered that there could be no objection to apply it still, in the sense of 'sudder malguzar' or principal engager for the revenue, to all individuals of that class in the country. \"But from the first period of our sway we seem to have been misled, partly by the etymology of the word, and partly by the absence of any class in our own country corresponding with these large farmers of revenue, and the term zamindar has thus been brought to signify the possession of a proprietary right in the land itself. In compliance with this new signification of the word, those who have it in the lower provinces have been constituted absolute masters of the tract of which they were found to pay the revenue, whether that tract were large or small, and whether the occupancy of the soil really belonged to them or not. And it appears that the people of the country have entirely adopted the term in its new sense, and they have learned to prize it as the official title which conveys the same idea as the more familiar ones of 'bhumiyas,' 'biewadars,' &c., which are in use among themselves.\n\nIn the case of Mursan, for example, they would have considered the recognition of the Raja as zamindar of the whole parganah to be fatal to the security of their tenures. Since then the native governments, whose usage in this respect was the only foundation of the Raja's claim, have passed away, and different views have since been adopted, as well by the mass of the people as by the Government itself,\" Mr. Thornton thought that it would be neither just nor expedient to admit the claim alluded to; nor was there anything in the documents conveying the grants to Nandram and Bhoj Singh which could affect this question. The argument will equally apply against the concession of the title to the Raja, whether his ancestors obtained that title by a formal grant, or merely from custom and courtesy, and, moreover, it is evident that no formal grant was intended in either of those cases. Such a grant would have required an imperial farm\u00e1n and the Emperor's seal, and would have clearly conveyed an hereditary title. But the simple order of the minister of the day was sufficient to commit the fiscal and favildari charge of a district to any individual, and to assign him a jagir therein as the reward of his services, both arrangements\n\n1 Settlement Report, 257. The biewadars are chiefly cultivating proprietors, tilling the land without the intervention of any non-proprietary cultivating class.\nbeing equally liable to cease on the death of the individual in question or at the minister's own pleasure. The real grounds for upholding the tenure were its long continuance and the principle laid down by Government of maintaining any arrangement which was found to be in force at the time of the cession or conquest. Mr. Thornton found that in quite two-thirds of the great talukas the original proprietary body still survived. In these he acknowledged the rights of the village communities, but owing to the long continued connection with the talukad\u00e1rs, he allowed to the latter a certain right, called the \"superior\" or taluka-d\u00e1ri right, by which the talukadar received a certain percentage (malik\u00e1na) of the revenue paid by the \"inferior\" proprietors. These words \"superior\" and \"inferior\" are not used as indicative of the quality of the respective rights, but refer to the position of the holders with regard to the State. The inferior proprietors or biswad\u00e1rs pay their revenue through the superior proprietors to Government.\n\nThe proportion of the assets allowed as malik\u00e1na, or the dues of the superior proprietors, varied with each taluka. In all cases the biswad\u00e1rs were allowed 20 per cent. of the gross rental assets, and of the remainder 30 per cent. was allowed to the talukad\u00e1rs of Kanka and Kajran, and 18 per cent. to the other J\u00e1t talukad\u00e1rs. Mr. Thomason\\(^1\\) ruled that of the \\(22\\frac{1}{2}\\) per cent. of the revenue (or 18 per cent. of the assets) thus alienated, only ten per cent. should remain as a heritable and transferable right to the heirs of the talukad\u00e1rs on the demise of the existing incumbents. This rule has not been always observed, and in the case of Raja Tikam Singh of Murs\u00e1n, Government has conferred on him and his heirs for ever the same amount of malik\u00e1na as that fixed at last settlement. This is very hard on the village proprietors, for, as noticed by Mr. Smith, whilst they would have only had to pay 55 per cent. of the assets as land-revenue under the existing rules on the death of Tikam Singh, or, in other words, 50 per cent. of the assets plus 10 per cent. on the revenue, they will have now to pay 63\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) per cent. of the assets for ever, and thus pay the reward which Government certainly intended should be paid out of its own resources. Mr. Thornton hoped that his new arrangements would place the rights of both parties on a firm basis, which should be equally advantageous to the superior and inferior proprietor, but Mr. Smith shows that these hopes have scarcely been realized. \"On the whole, indeed, the policy has been favourable to the prosperity and maintenance of the high position of the talukad\u00e1rs, and where it has appeared to fail, its failure is not due to the nature of the policy itself, but to the minute subdivision of property consequent on the laws of Hind\u00fa inheritance, or to the extravagance of the original talukadar. But it has been fatal to the great majority of the inferior proprietors or biswad\u00e1rs.\"\n\n\\(^1\\) Thomason's Desp., I, 24; II., 199.\nThe following tables show the changes in the talukadari rights during the last settlement:\n\n| No. of villages | No. of villages | Land-revenue | Malikana | Total |\n|-----------------|----------------|--------------|----------|-------|\n| 218             | 119            | Rs. 1,039,694|          |       |\n|                 |                | Rs. 39,868   |          |       |\n|                 |                | Rs. 1,079,562|          |       |\n\n| No. of villages | Land-revenue | Malikana | Total |\n|-----------------|--------------|----------|-------|\n| 15              | Rs. 13,083   |          |       |\n|                 | Rs. 3,176    |          |       |\n|                 | Rs. 16,259   |          |       |\n\n| No. of villages | Land-revenue | Malikana | Total |\n|-----------------|--------------|----------|-------|\n| 14              | Rs. 13,086   |          |       |\n|                 | Rs. 4,088    |          |       |\n|                 | Rs. 17,174   |          |       |\n\n| No. of villages | Land-revenue | Malikana | Total |\n|-----------------|--------------|----------|-------|\n| 70              | Rs. 85,848   |          |       |\n|                 | Rs. 38,346   |          |       |\n|                 | Rs. 124,194  |          |       |\n\nOf the villages where the talukadari rights have been preserved intact, the Raja of Mursan holds 84, Gir Parshad Singh of Shahzadpur holds 19, and the remaining 16 belong to various small talukas of the Hathras and Mursan families. Of the 70 estates where the superior rights have gone to strangers, 30 belonged to the Mendu estate, 14 to Husain, and the remainder to various small talukadars whose rights were sold as they became more minutely subdivided by the increase in the number of co-sharers. On the whole, 53 per cent. of the talukadari rights remains with the original owners, 40 per cent. has been permanently alienated, and seven per cent. has been temporarily alienated between 1838 and 1868.\n\nThe biswadari rights have suffered still greater vicissitudes. Of the 218 villages, 79 have entirely passed out of the hands of the original proprietors; in 71 villages half and more than half the area of the village has been alienated; in 49 less than one-half the area has been transferred, and in only 19 villages is the stock of the old proprietors in possession. In other words, in nine per cent. of the malikana villages paying six per cent. of the original demand the original stock remains; in 22.5 per cent. of the villages paying 24 per cent. of the demand they have lost nearly half their estates; in 32.5 per cent. of the villages paying 34 per cent. of the entire revenue assessed they have lost more than half their possessions, and have lost all in 36 per cent. of the villages paying the same percentage of the land-revenue. This state of things is much to be regretted. The purchasers of both the\nsuperior and inferior interests belong to the Baniya and Mah\u00e1jan money-lending classes. Mr. Smith writes:\u2014\u201cThere can be little doubt that the cause of their (biswad\u00e1rs) decay has been the large percentage of assets which was deducted as their joint dues to Government and the talukad\u00e1r. Eighty per cent. was too large a proportion to be paid at a time when prices were low and the effects of the former heavy assessments were still being felt. Those who have held on until now are mostly in a very different position; their revenue has long been paid with ease, and the present settlement has added practically nothing to the demand.\u201d \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u201cThe H\u00e1thras Baniyas and the village money-lenders, who have taken the place of the Jats and Rajputs of thirty years ago, bought their estates well knowing their liabilities, and at a time when the profits of zamind\u00e1rs were much lower than they are now; and now land has so greatly increased in value, and so much greater importance is attached to its possession, they are not likely to turn defaulters. Those of the old proprietors still remaining are in a more prosperous condition than they were, and their prosperity is still increasing with high prices and rising rents. The enhancement in their total payments, resulting from the retention of the old malik\u00e1na allowances, is probably not sufficient to ruin them.\u201d\n\nMr. Smith notices a peculiar tenure to be found amongst certain village communities, especially in Khair and Igl\u00e1s. \u201cThe village, as a whole, is held in imperfect pattid\u00e1ri tenure; each proprietor holds a certain portion of the area in severalty, and, besides, enjoys his share of common rights of whatever value or kind they may be. But apart from the general body of proprietors, who all share on the same principles, will be found one or two individuals who are admitted to be proprietors, but are allowed no share whatever in the interests held in common. They own so many acres of land, which they cultivate or lease out as they please, and for which they pay Government revenue, but have no further concern with the general management of the estate, and no voice in the settlement of village accounts. The origin of these tenures is various. Sometimes the holdings have been granted to returned absentees or their descendants, who claim relationship with the coparcenary body, but whose ancient rights have been forfeited by lapse of time and non-possession. Sometimes they are held by Brahmans, whose ancestors obtained them from former proprietors. In some cases they are the result of the settlement of a disputed claim to a share in the common property. The holdings are mostly of small extent and value.\u201d\n\nDividing the proprietary body into three classes,\u20141st, petty proprietors, or Distribution and value of those possessing one-fourth or less of a single village; proprietary rights. 2ndly, those possessing more than one-fourth, and not more than an entire village; and 3rdly, those who are proprietors of more than\none village, the following statement shows the distribution of the land amongst the proprietors in this district at the recent settlement:\n\n| Class of proprietor | Number of shares | Total area in acres | Average area per share in acres | Revenue in rupees | Rate per acre in rupees | Average revenue per share in rupees | Total area cultivated by tenants in acres | Average area per share cultivated by tenants in acres | Total area cultivated by shareholders | Average area per share cultivated by shareholders |\n|---------------------|-----------------|---------------------|---------------------------------|------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| 1st or petty        | 96,808          | 426,682             | 4                               | 10,494           | 40                     | 262,853                           | 108                                      | 148,230                                       | 5                                           |\n| 2nd or middling     | 770             | 186,530             | 2                               | 8,949            | 5                       | 138,515                           | 172                                      | 84,005                                        | 44                                          |\n| 3rd or large        | 196             | 304,570             | 1                                | 7,029            | 11                      | 8,587                             | 1,413                                    | 27,708                                       | 149                                         |\n| Total               | 27,178          | 697,173             | 3                               | 21,473           | 8                       | 275,867                           | 254                                      | 304,938                                      | 76                                          |\n\nThese statistics show that the district is held either by very large or very small proprietors. The first class in the above table holds 47\u00b75 per cent. of the entire cultivated area, the second class holds 18\u00b75 per cent., and the third class has 34 per cent. Each proprietor cultivates a portion of his share as his seer or home-farm, and leases out the remainder to tenants. The average amount retained by each class of proprietor will be the difference between columns 9 and 4, and the profits will be represented by the difference between the rental and the revenue of the plots leased plus the net profits of the home-farm. Taking with Mr. Smith the first class or petty proprietors, the area of the portions leased to tenants amounts to 10\u00b78 acres, of which the land-revenue is Rs. 26-11-2, and the rental therefore paid by tenants will be Rs. 53-6-4. As shown elsewhere (page 377), Mr. Smith estimates the produce of the land as worth, on an average, Rs. 25-12-3 per acre, and therefore the produce of the 5\u00b74 acres retained as his home-farm by the petty proprietor will amount to Rs. 139-2-1. From this must be deducted the cost of production apart from rent or revenue, which may fairly be set down at two-fifths of the produce. The results are as follows:\n\n**Expenditure**\n\n| Description                          | Rs.   | a. p. |\n|--------------------------------------|-------|-------|\n| Land-revenue of entire holding       | 40    | 0     |\n| Causes and patent's fees              | 6     | 0     |\n| Cost of cultivation of home-farm     | 55    | 10    |\n| **Total Rs.**                        | 101   | 11    |\n\n**Receipts**\n\n| Description                          | Rs.   | a. p. |\n|--------------------------------------|-------|-------|\n| Rent of tenant's land                | 53    | 6     |\n| Value of produce of home-farm        | 189   | 2     |\n| **Total**                            | 192   | 8     |\n| Balance left to proprietor, Rs.      | 30    | 13    |\nThis gives a monthly income of Rs. 7-9-1 per month to the petty proprietor, and, as far as one can see, Mr. Smith's figures are incontrovertible. \"No doubt the income of the zamindar is supplemented in various ways. There is the common pasture land of the village on which he can graze his cattle; his wood for fuel or for agricultural implements is grown on his own estate; his hired labour is obtained at a cheap rate, some kinds of labour are given gratis, and custom assigns to him certain dues from his tenants at marriages and other ceremonies. If, too, he is out of the money-lender's hands, he can store his grain and sell it at a higher rate than the harvest price. But, after all, the great majority of the members of the proprietary communities are poor men, who make a rudely comfortable subsistence perhaps, but nothing more.\" Calculated in the same way, the average income of proprietors of the second class will amount to Rs. 65-3-0 per mensem, or Rs. 782-4-3 per annum; and similarly the income of the third class amounts to Rs. 4,580 per annum, or Rs. 381 per mensem. Mr. Smith explains the difference in the incidence of the revenue on the first and third classes of proprietors as due to the fact that, in Atrauli, the poorest subdivision in the district, \"petty proprietors hold a much smaller, and great proprietors a much larger area than in any other portion of the district.\" Deduct the area and revenue belonging to the two classes in this tahsil, and the rate paid by each for the remainder of the district comes out exactly the same, or Rs. 2-7-11. The villages held by the laborious proprietary communities have not been, \"as was often the case in former times, assessed at a higher rate than those of other landholders.\" On the whole, the portion of the proprietary body included in the second and third classes is fairly well off. Many of the third class possess estates in other districts, or are engaged in trade or service, and their actual profits from the land here is but a small item of their income. Again the increase of population and the subdivision of estates continually tends to drive the proprietor to the money-lender, and to the accumulation of land in the hands of the wealthy capitalists.\n\nThe revenue-free (mudfi) tenures may be divided into\u2014(1) those which are granted for ever; (2) life grants and groves, the revenue of the latter of which will be assessed on the removal or decay of the trees; and (3) certain lands part of the revenue of which is paid to Government, but is devoted to special purposes and does not form a portion of the general revenue of the State. The permanent alienations may be further subdivided into\u2014(a) whole estates, (b) small plots, and (c) patches of less than ten bighas. The returns of the revenue-free plots and patches of land for the H\u00e2thras and Sikandra Rao tahsils are incomplete, and give only an estimate.\n\n---\n\n1 The settlement accounts of 1805-06 show that the number of persons admitted to engagements as proprietors was then only 827; these increased to 3,824 in 1808-09, and to 4,612 in 1812-13.\nThe following statement gives the returns for the whole district under each class:\n\n| Class of grant | Area in acres | Estimated land-revenue remitted | Cesses | Remarks |\n|---------------|---------------|---------------------------------|--------|---------|\n| **1.

This gives 2.5 per cent. on the total demand, and only one per cent. of this will eventually revert to the State.\n\nOf the twelve villages held revenue-free in perpetuity, two belong to the dargah of Sh\u00e1h Jam\u00e1l (see ALIGARH town); L\u00e1l Garhi History of these grants. to a Hind\u00fa temple near H\u00e1thras; Mominabad and H\u00e1shimpur to a temple at Brindaban in Muttra; three villages to the Derridon family or their representatives (page 449). Badhesi was given to one Nauh\u00e1t R\u00e1\u00ed in Akbar's time, and still belongs to his descendants; and Kh\u00e9riya Khwajah Budha, Husainpur, and Sul\u00e1mpur were Musalm\u00e1n grants for religious purposes. The remaining grants in perpetuity are small plots and patches given by the village proprietors either for the support of small shrines and temples, or for the subsistence of Brahmans and fakirs. Few of these have ever been confirmed by the State. At Mr. Thornton's settlement those patches not exceeding ten bighas, found in the possession of members of the priestly clan, were granted to them as such, and those to which the occupants seemed to have no claim were resumed at once, or only granted free of revenue until the next settlement. Of the latter class, Mr. Smith has resumed land assessed now at Rs. 1,823, but the account is incomplete. The five villages granted revenue-free for two generations comprise a portion of the reward given to Raja Tikam Singh of Mur-s\u00e1n for his services in the mutiny. The villages are assessed at Rs. 6,550, and the Raja pays the excess above Rs. 6,000 into the treasury. He also holds nine villages as a life grant, assessed at Rs. 4,190 per annum, which will be paid by his heirs. Two other life villages, Oghipur and Imlahra, were with\nTimukhiya, in the Meerut District, granted by the Marhattas to the man who captured Ghulam Kailir on his escape from Meerut. They were originally granted in perpetuity, but owing to the loss of the sanad, the Aligarh estates will be resumed on the death of the present grantee, whilst the Meerut village still remains with his representative. The Iglas villages are those of which the revenue is granted partly (one-fourth) to the heirs and assignees of Gangan-dhar Pandit, and partly for the support of the Agra College. At the recent settlement of the district, the holders of resumed revenue-free grants have been recorded as absolute proprietors of their lands.\n\nThe following statement shows the distribution of the cultivated area amongst proprietary and non-proprietary cultivators.\n\nOf the entire cultivated area, 29 per cent. is held by cultivators with a right of occupancy, 48 per cent. by tenants-at-will, and 23 per cent. as seer by the proprietors. Of the area cultivated by tenants only, those having a right of occupancy hold 37 per cent., whilst tenants-at-will hold 63 per cent. of the tenant area:\n\n### Statement showing classes of cultivators and areas held by them.\n\n| Parganas | Cultivated by proprietors | Cultivated by tenants with rights of occupancy | Cultivated by tenants without a right of occupancy |\n|----------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n|          | Number of holdings | Area | Average acres per holding | Number of holdings | Area | Average acres per holding | Number of holdings | Area | Average acres per holding |\n| Atrai    | 668                | 10,847 | 16.28 | 2,195 | 22,511 | 10.95 | 4,715 | 37,369 | 7.91 |\n| Gangiri  | 848                | 9,198 | 26.45 | 2,780 | 2,148 | 7.86 | 5,150 | 46,915 | 9.49 |\n| Hasangarh| 2,024              | 24,559 | 8.4   | 1,328 | 8,734 | 7.11 | 3,442 | 35,534 | 9.74 |\n| Gorai    | 996                | 9,184 | 9.91 | 913 | 8,956 | 9.84 | 2,852 | 30,493 | 10.55 |\n| Akabad   | 706                | 8,33 | 11.8 | 3,175 | 25,425 | 8 | 1,698 | 16,096 | 10.0 |\n| Sitandra Rao | 1,251            | 19,768 | 15.18 | 6,144 | 50,001 | 9.74 | 4,068 | 26,496 | 6.22 |\n| Dholi    | 248                | 757 | 3.04 | 416 | 3,694 | 8.94 | 5,081 | 59,507 | 10.3 |\n| Koll     | 2,068              | 29,851 | 14.22 | 4,166 | 33,694 | 8 | 5,081 | 59,507 | 10.3 |\n| Morhal   | 216                | 4,850 | 21.45 | .07 | 8,485 | 9.85 | 1,713 | 15,458 | 7.29 |\n| Tappal   | 2,052              | 31,605 | 15.4 | 1,256 | 9,537 | 7.63 | 3,130 | 26,974 | 8.64 |\n| Chandans | 793                | 15,039 | 18.96 | 560 | 6,286 | 11.2 | 1,381 | 21,709 | 16.0 |\n| Khair    | 1,367              | 30,856 | 14.89 | 1,519 | 13,567 | 10.3 | 3,609 | 43,867 | 12.1 |\n| Mureah   | 861                | 7,976 | 9.26 | 1,000 | 13,298 | 8.19 | 2,453 | 18,636 | 7.6 |\n| Hathras  | 951                | 13,553 | 14.28 | 5,153 | 30,755 | 11.1 | 5,305 | 55,377 | 10.6 |\n| **Total**| **15,193**         | **204,998** | **13.49** | **28,380** | **858,749** | **9.12** | **43,753** | **4,33,485** | **9.9** |\n\nMr. Smith writes that \"on the whole there seems to be good reason for believing that the area held by tenants with a right of occupancy has not decreased during the last settlement.\" In the first place those only were recorded then as having a right of\n\n---\n\n1 The total number of holdings is 67,825, occupying 897,173 acres, and giving an average area of holdings of all classes of 10.27 acres.\noccupancy, who had really cultivated for generations in the village, and were of the better castes and classes. Those of menial and inferior castes, though they always held land in a village, never seem to have attained the privilege of a right of occupancy. Act X. of 1859 changed all this; it recognized no distinctions of caste or class, and put altogether aside the custom of a village if the custom was ruled by any other standard than the mere occupancy of twelve years' duration. It was only probable, therefore, that when that law was passed many tenants would find themselves in possession of occupancy rights which they had never thought of claiming before. The effect of every succeeding year was to increase the number of these tenants. At first neither tenants nor zamindars perfectly understood their position; as years went on and the law became gradually better known, a struggle arose between the two classes, and this struggle has been continuously going on. Where the zamindar is very powerful and at the same time inclined to be exacting, the tenant goes to the wall, and very few maurisi cultivators are now found on the large estates held by the Nan-Muslim talukadars of Koil and Morthal, by the Path\u00e1n zamindars of Atranli, or by the wealthier Rajp\u00fat proprietors of Sikandra and Akra-bad. But on the other hand, where the zamindar is easy going, like the Raja of Murs\u00e1n, or comparatively weak, like the general run of smaller proprietors, the cultivator will fight for his rights, and has little difficulty in establishing them. The cases instituted in the Settlement Courts with the object of obtaining a record of maurisi rights have been very numerous. On the whole I am inclined to think that the cultivator has got the best of the battle; and that if the records of last settlement survived, it would be found that the maurisi area had increased. But it is doubtful if it will increase much further. The zamindars are now fully alive to the disadvantages of the position, as far as they themselves are concerned, and few tenants will henceforth ever be allowed to hold beyond the limit of eleven years, within which term the power of dispossession remains with the proprietor.\" Many artifices were resorted to in order to induce the old cultivators to resign their rights at the time of settlement, but fortunately the recording officer thought it necessary to note only facts, and so disappointed many who then wished to get rid, once and for ever of \"the 12 years' man.\" The new revenue laws, if judiciously worked, will smooth over much of the present difficulty, for the Settlement Officer will now have power to increase the rents of the cultivators pari passu with the increase of the land-revenue, and the doubtful litigation which up to the present time inevitably ensued after each revision of settlement will be avoided. The custom of subdividing the land under the operation of the laws of inheritance has lessened the average extent per holding, and will continue to work in this direction. Occupancy rights are frequently the subject of temporary transfer, but permanent transfers seem to be unknown in this district.\nThe bulk of the agricultural classes in this district are drawn from the Brahman, J\u00e1t, Cham\u00e1r, Rajp\u00fat, Ahir, and Lodha castes, more especially from the three first mentioned. Of these the J\u00e1ts and Cham\u00e1rs are the best cultivators. The J\u00e1ts unite with untiring diligence an intelligent discrimination as to rotation of crops, and the treatment and selection of soils, and are almost alone in the practice of regularly and constantly employing their women in field labour. The Cham\u00e1rs are laborious and painstaking, but are less enterprising cultivators. The mass of the agricultural classes are fairly well-to-do, but while some are substantial farmers with a good stock of cattle and a reserve for a bad season, many still discount the harvest at the door of the village money-lender, and rely upon his advances for food and seed alike. The average extent per holding is 9\u00b712 acres for cultivators with a right of occupancy and 9\u00b79 acres for tenants-at-will. Perhaps 10, 30, and 50 acres, respectively, would fairly represent the local idea of a small, a middle-sized, and a large holding. Many holdings, however, sink below ten acres, and many rise above fifty acres. With regard to the question as to whether a five-acre holding is as good as eight rupees cash wages a month the Assistant Settlement Officer writes:\u2014\"The answer to the question depends upon the quality of the soil and the character of the cultivator. As a rule five acres in this district do not represent a value equal to eight rupees cash wages. Usually a holding consists of a small portion of the best and a large portion of inferior land. Now eight rupees a month would represent a clear profit of eleven rupees per standard bigha, which is an exceptionally high figure here. I should say that the produce of an ordinary five-acre holding is equivalent to an income of five rupees a month.\" Curiously enough the average area per holding (10\u00b727 acres) nearly coincides with the average area under tillage per plough (11 acres), and accords pretty closely with the popular estimate of fifty village bighas per plough. The total number of ploughs is over 70,000, and each requires two bullocks. Ploughs with only one bullock are exceedingly rare; and if a cultivator cannot afford two bullocks, he falls back on the chance of a loan, or works the land with his own hand. The following statement shows the number of ploughs in each tahsil and the average cultivated area in acres to each plough:\n\n| Tahsil     | Ploughs | Area |\n|------------|---------|------|\n| Sikandra Rao | ...    | 14,202 | 10\u00b70 |\n| Khair      | ...    | 14,183 | 13\u00b70 |\n| H\u00e9thras    | ...    | 13,155 | 11\u00b74 |\n| Igl\u00e1s      | ...    | 9,454  | 12\u00b74 |\n| Koil       | ...    | 13,105 | 11\u00b70 |\n| Atrauli    | ...    | 13,325 | 11\u00b70 |\n\n---\n\n**Note:** The table provides data on the number of ploughs and the average cultivated area in acres for each tahsil.\nThroughout the district cash rents are the rule. In a few estates *batdi* or division of the produce, and *sabti* or fixed cash rates according to the crop, still prevail. In the latter case, should the crop fail, a proportional deduction is allowed in the rent demanded. As a rule, the tenant holds on a written lease for a long or a short term, as the case may be; often the agreement is a verbal one, generally made at the commencement of the agricultural year, or a particular rent is sanctioned by the usage of years, and in some cases of generations. *Batdi* is dying out, as with the advance of cultivation the tenant finds it more his interest to have a fixed sum to pay, and the practice now only obtains where, from the character of the soil and the absence of irrigation, the outturn is uncertain and the cultivation is a mere matter of speculation. It is now wholly confined to the kh\u00e9dir lands and the high sandy soil above the two great rivers in the Khair and Atrauli tahsils. In Atrauli the system chiefly prevails in the sandy estates of the D\u00e1tauli and Bhamauri N\u00e1h talukas, which are cultivated by Ahars and Aberiyas, and there is good reason to believe that the system suits these tracts. In Khair the system is dying out. As a rule, the standard of division is half to the landowner and half to the tenant; and only in a few cases, chiefly the headmen of the Atrauli villages, does the landowner restrict himself to two-fifths of the produce. Altogether there were 252 cases of commutation of produce rents to cash rents from 1866 to 1873, of which 182 cases and 7,824 acres belong to Atrauli, 96 cases and 930 acres to Khair, and 24 cases and 511 acres to Koil. The rent-rate fixed averages Rs. 2-15-7 per acre, \"whilst the general rent-rate of the whole district is Rs. 4-12-6, or a rate sixty per cent. higher than that found possible to apply to *batdi* lands.\" Rates of rent vary to same extent throughout the district, but the following details give the average rates found at settlement:\n\n| Tahsil | Bdra. | Manjha. | Outlying lands. |\n|--------|-------|---------|----------------|\n|        | Irrigated. | Dry. | Irrigated. | Dry. | Irrigated. | 1st class dry. | 2nd class dry. |\n|        | Rs. a. p. | Rs. a. p. | Rs. a. p. | Rs. a. p. | Rs. a. p. | Rs. a. p. | Rs. a. p. |\n| Sikandra Rao ... | 13 0 0 5 4 0 | 8 12 0 3 8 0 | 4 12 0 | 2 18 0 | 1 18 0 |\n| Atranli ... | 12 4 6 5 4 3 | 8 12 0 3 8 0 | 4 6 2 | 2 10 2 | 1 10 4 |\n| Koil ... | 11 8 0 5 4 0 | 8 4 0 3 8 0 | 4 9 0 | 2 12 0 | 1 12 0 |\n| Igt\u00e1s ... | 11 6 0 5 4 0 | 8 4 0 3 8 0 | 4 12 0 | 2 12 0 | 1 12 0 |\n| Pargana. | Khair ... | 12 0 0 5 4 0 | 8 12 0 3 8 0 | 4 12 0 | 5 0 0 | 0 0 0 |\n| Chandans ... | 12 0 0 5 4 0 | 8 12 0 3 8 0 | 4 12 0 | 5 0 0 | 2 0 0 |\n| Tappals ... | 11 8 0 5 4 0 | 8 4 0 3 8 0 | 4 9 0 | 2 0 0 | 2 0 0 |\n| H\u00e1hras ... | 11 8 0 5 4 0 | 8 8 0 3 8 0 | 6 0 0 | 2 12 0 | 1 12 0 |\n| Mur\u00e1n ... | 11 0 0 5 4 0 | 8 0 0 3 8 0 | 4 9 0 | 2 12 0 | 1 12 0 |\nIncreased prices, competition for land, and increased population have all tended to raise the rent-rates beyond those prevalent at the last settlement. The settlement records show that the percentage of rise during the settlement operations varies from 17 to 38, the average for the whole district being about 31 per cent. From 1866 to the middle of 1873, 2,359 enhancement cases were decided by the settlement courts, involving an extent of 52,769 acres, or one-sixteenth of the entire cultivated area. The former rent-rate of this tract was Rs. 1,91,303, and the rental now fixed is Rs. 2,50,699; the old rate was Rs. 3-10-0 per acre, and the new rate is Rs. 4-12-0, giving a rise of 31 per cent. The greatest number of enhancement cases has been decided in tahsil Sikandra Rao, which has so largely benefited of late years by canal irrigation; next in order come the Koil, Igl\u00e1s, H\u00e1thras, Atrauli, and Khair tahsils.\n\n| Tahsil     | No. of cases | Area in acres | Former rental | Former rent-rate | Amount enhanced | New rental | New rent-rate | Percentage of rise |\n|------------|--------------|---------------|---------------|------------------|-----------------|------------|---------------|-------------------|\n| Atrauli    | 177          | 5,803         | 20,685        | 3 9 0            | 7,930           | 28,615     | 4 12 8        | 38                |\n| Igl\u00e1s      | 193          | 9,914         | 33,124        | 3 15 11          | 10,984          | 45,148     | 4 8 9         | 38                |\n| Sikandra Rao | 889       | 16,692        | 55,760        | 3 12 9           | 18,512          | 75,288     | 4 7 11        | 32                |\n| Koil       | 517          | 10,466        | 36,853        | 3 8 3            | 15,449          | 50,308     | 4 12 6        | 36                |\n| Khair      | 168          | 4,566         | 15,154        | 3 5 1            | 4,816           | 19,970     | 4 5 81       | 31                |\n| H\u00e1thras    | 415          | 6,018         | 26,736        | 4 7 0            | 4,856           | 31,382     | 5 8 14       | 17                |\n| **Total**  | **2,359**    | **52,769**    | **1,91,303**  | **3 10 0**       | **59,396**      | **2,50,700** | **4 12 0**   | **31**            |\n\nRegarding these enhancement suits, it would at first sight appear that they There were really few have been very few when the area and the increase of enhancement suits. revenue at assessment is considered. \"But,\" writes Mr. Smith, \"it must be remembered, in the first place, that these suits are only instituted against tenants with a right of occupancy, and that the total area held by this class of tenants in this district is only 258,749 acres, so that the amount of land hitherto affected by suits is rather more than one-fifth of the full amount to which suits are applicable, and meanwhile more cases are being instituted. In the next place the characteristics of the Aligarh tenures are on the whole unfavourable to the institution of an excessive number of cases. Talukad\u00e1rs and zam\u00ednd\u00e1rs owning large collections of villages abound on the one hand, and, on the other, proprietary brotherhoods, cultivating their own land, are very numerous. With neither class are rent suits in favour. The tenants of the more powerful proprietors, whether tenants with a right of occupancy or tenants-at-will, find it to their interest to meet the views of their zam\u00ednd\u00e1rs, and when an enhancement of revenue has taken place are generally willing to\npay an enhanced rent. In the village communities, the cultivators are either of the same brotherhood, or are, at all events, on terms of amity and almost equality with the proprietary body. The new revenue is provided for by an increased rate on the holdings of the members of the community; while each cultivator, not a proprietor, readily acknowledges the justice of a similarly increased rent on his own patch of land. In neither cases are the courts needed or sought. It is in villages held by what may be called the middle class of proprietors, those who own one or two villages only, or even less, and have little wealth or hereditary influence, or in estates where new purchasers have crept in, that enhancement cases chiefly arise. Proprietors of these classes are compelled to have recourse to the courts for assistance in raising rents. But nevertheless, at the time of settlement, the cultivators as a body admit their liability to an enhanced demand, when they see that a corresponding increase is exacted by the State from the zamindars, and all proprietors alike, if they use tact and show a wish to conciliate, can at such a time get their tenants to agree to rents which on other occasions they would in vain demand; and hence it is that in Aligarh a very large number of rents have been settled by mutual agreement.\"\n\nAs shown elsewhere the increase in cultivation during the past settlement General increase of rent has been 7 per cent., and the increase in irrigation throughout has been 28 per cent. Taking Rs. 4-4-0 per acre as the irrigated rent-rate of the past settlement, and Re. 1-9-0 as the unirrigated rent-rate, and applying these rates to the former areas, there results a rental for the whole district of Rs. 26,72,014. The rental actually assumed in 1838 was Rs. 26,71,273. Applying the same rates to the increased cultivated and irrigated areas of the present settlement, the result is a rental of Rs. 31,54,947, or an increase of 18 per cent. on the application of the old rates. The rate of this rental will be Rs. 3-8-1 per acre, and the former rent-rate was Rs. 3-2-11 per acre. \"If the above assumption,\" writes Mr. Smith, \"approximate to correctness, a rise of 10 per cent. in the general rent-rate will represent the combined effects of an increase of 7 per cent. in cultivation and 28 per cent. in irrigation. This is as much as could be expected, when it is considered that the proportion of irrigation to cultivation has only altered by 12-3 per cent., and that the increase in cultivation itself, though small, has a tendency at least to lower the general rate. If not exactly the truth, this calculation is near enough for all practical purposes.\"\n\nTaking the figures given above and the rentals recorded in the village papers, it will be seen that rents have actually risen. The village papers give the rents which purport to be actually paid by cultivators, both hereditary and tenants-at-will, as well as the nominal rents entered for the land held as seer by proprietors. Taking the seer land at non-occupancy rates, being those at which it would be leased if not cultivated by the proprietors, the total recorded rental\nof the district is found to be Rs. 36,53,016, or 36-7 per cent. above the rental of 1838. The old rent-rate of 1838 was Rs. 3-2-11 per acre, and the new rental according to the village papers amounts to Rs. 4-0-11 per acre, giving a rise of 27 per cent. in the rent-rate. But these records are imperfect if taken as they stand. In many cases the rents are purposely under-stated, and in others, though correctly given, they are much below the rents paid elsewhere for similar land. Still materials are forthcoming for the ascertainment of the true rental; rent suits, the examination of the accounts of farmed villages, and personal enquiry were all brought in as aids to the correction of the rental as recorded in the village papers, and the result was a rental of Rs. 42,94,685 and a rent-rate of Rs. 4-12-6 per acre, which allows for purposely under-stated rent-rolls, under-rented villages, and for future enhancement where needed. Thus ascertained facts show that the effect of the rise in prices and the increase in population, cultivation, irrigation, means of communication, &c., has been an increase in the rental of about 50 per cent., and the tendency is still towards a rise. \"On the whole there can be very little doubt that any approximation to the true idea of rent is only beginning to be grasped by the zamindar, and that until of late years, rents have meant little more than a slight arbitrary increase on the revenue-rates.\"\n\nAs might be expected, one of the results of peace was the enhanced value of land, and with it the possibility of making the land a security for the advancement of money. The first sale for arrears of revenue took place in June, 1810, for the balances of 1216 and 1217 fasi, and was quickly followed by others, so that during 1810-11, 45 estates, paying an aggregate revenue of Rs. 27,868, were put up for auction for arrears amounting to Rs. 11,253, and were sold for Rs. 2,359. Thirty-four of these were bought in by Government for nominal prices. This went on from bad to worse, so that hundreds of estates were put up for sale, but found few purchasers. Not so much harm as might have been expected was done by this multiplicity of sales. Few estates were actually sold, and the remainder were re-settled, in many cases with the original zamindars, at reduced assessments. In other cases, when they were temporarily re-settled with farmers, they were subsequently restored to the real proprietors on their paying up the balances for which they had been sold. In fact the zamindars seem to have regarded the sale regulation as a kind of Insolvent Act, which released them from their embarrassments, and gave them a fresh lease of their villages on more favourable terms. Another device which they occasionally resorted to was the throwing up of their engagements, in hopes of thereby compelling the revenue authorities to lower the demand. This practice became so general that the Board of Commissioners found it advisable to issue a circular in\n\n---\n\n1 Hutchinson, p. 39.  \n2 17th February, 1817.\nALIGARH DISTRICT.\n\n1817, directing that in cases where zamindars gave in their resignation in hopes of the assessment being lowered, the Collectors should make it a rule to settle with the farmer, and not to re-admit the zamindars on a lower assessment.\n\n| Year | Number of estates | Land-revenue | Areas | Sale proceeds | Number purchased by Government |\n|------|------------------|--------------|-------|---------------|-------------------------------|\n| 1810-11 | ... | ... | 45 | Rs. 27,868 | 11,253 | 2,359 | 34 |\n| 1812-13 | ... | ... | 59 | 53,639 | 18,097 | 3,558 | 24 |\n| 1814-15 | ... | ... | 122 | 1,61,891 | 1,35,301 | 7,310 | 83 |\n\nMr. Stirling, writing in 1831, says that \"almost all the villages in this district have been mortgaged, farmed, sold, or given over to creditors.\" Mr. Smith, writing in 1874, qualifies this statement and says that the alienations which took place previous to last settlement cannot be compared in extent with those which occurred subsequent to 1833. The changes were mostly in individual villages, and nothing approaching a general transfer of ownership took place. It was only when rights were established and consolidated by the elaborate proceedings of the last settlement that radical changes began. As has been seen, land formerly had no marketable value and purchasers could not be found. The system of requiring security for advances, the handing over the village communities to the tender mercies of the talukadar, the system of rewarding the sub-collectors of revenue by a commission, the sudden changes made by the conferment of a proprietary right on persons little accustomed to understand its responsibilities, and the withdrawal of the capital invested in indigo and the company's trade all prepared the way for the accrual of indebtedness which led to the introduction of capitalists and other speculators that is characteristic of the period between 1838 and 1868.\n\nLeaving out the transfers by confiscation on account of rebellion, the alienations by revenue process from 1839 to 1868 have amounted to 144,452 acres, or 11\u00b79 per cent. of the total area (1,213,779 acres), and 870,717 acres, have been alienated by private or forced sale, or 71\u00b77 per cent. of the total area. If sales of all kinds are reckoned as permanent transfers, while revenue farms and private mortgages are considered as temporary alienations only, then 608,650 acres, or 50 per cent., have been permanently, and 406,519 acres, or 33 per cent. of the total area, have been temporarily transferred during the short period of thirty years. Though\n\n1 From Mr. W. H. Smith's Report, 1875.\nthese figures represent the total area alienated, and where, as it often happened, a village was transferred more than once, the area has been calculated as many times; the transfers are abnormal and exceed those recorded in any other district in this division. Mr. Smith divides the period of thirty years into three decades and gives the following table of transfers:\n\n| Decade          | Transfers by revenue process | Transfer by other processes | Total |\n|-----------------|------------------------------|----------------------------|-------|\n| 1st (1839 to 1848) | ...                          | 95,285                     | 316,809 | 412,094 |\n| 2nd (1849 to 1858) | ...                          | 19,779                     | 248,823 | 268,602 |\n| 3rd (1859 to 1868) | ...                          | 19,488                     | 306,085 | 325,573 |\n| Total           | ...                          | 134,552                    | 870,717 | 1,005,269 |\n\nIn explanation of this table he writes:\u2014\u201cFrom this table it will be seen that nearly eight per cent. of the total area was transferred by revenue process during the first decade, and of the whole area transferred nearly 41 per cent. changed hands during the first ten years. In the second ten years transfers of all kinds were fewer than in either the previous or succeeding decades; land was increasing in value, rents were beginning to rise, and new owners had to a large extent taken the place of the former defaulters. But this period was one of low prices, and the effects seem to have been felt in the succeeding decade, when transfers again became more numerous. The reign of high prices did not set in until those proprietors who were embarrassed had lost the opportunity of recovering themselves. From the excess of mortgages over other modes of transfer in the second decade, and that of private sales in the third, it would seem that they first had recourse to a temporary alienation which probably only too often ended in a permanent loss of property. Mortgage in this country mostly involves the surrender of possession to the mortgagees, and generally ends in an absolute sale, when the mortgagor finds himself unable to meet his engagements. With all these transfers, therefore, it follows that the proprietors who were holding land at last settlement have to a large extent been displaced by strangers. In Atrauli, J\u0101ts and Rajp\u016bts together have lost more than half their former possessions; in Murthal the Chanh\u0101ns have yielded to the Nau-Muslim Badg\u016bjars, who with their old religion seem to have given up the thriftless tendencies of their caste; in Khair, J\u0101ts, Nau-Muslims and Chanh\u0101ns have all suffered in various degrees; in Tappal the Chanh\u0101ns have been almost obliterated from the list of zam\u012bnd\u0101rs; in H\u0101thras and Murs\u0101n few of the old clans of Rajp\u016bts survive, and even in Sikandra Rao and Akrabad there have been great changes of ownership. In Igl\u0101s the J\u0101ts have offered a tough resistance, but with moderate success.\n\n1 Except Koli and Atrauli.\nIn more exact terms the kanungo's returns show that in Atrauli and Gangiri together about 50 per cent. of the old proprietors have been replaced by others; in Igl\u00e1s 52\u00bd per cent. of the area has changed hands; in Khair 47 per cent. of the land is no longer held by the old zamindars, 38 per cent. having been permanently, and 9 per cent. temporarily alienated; in Sikandra 30 per cent. has gone for ever, while 25 per cent. is in mortgage and farm, and in H\u00e1thras 54\u00bd per cent. of the proprietary interests have suffered the former, 11\u00bd per cent. the latter fate.\"\n\nThe following statement shows the relative gains and losses of the various castes in land paying revenue to Government, giving the areas held by each caste at the commencement of the past settlement and at the beginning of the present settlement:\n\n| Caste       | Area held at former settlement | Present area |\n|-------------|--------------------------------|--------------|\n| Rajp\u00fat      | 466,921                        | 846,648      |\n| J\u00e1ts        | 302,055                        | 284,926      |\n| Brahman     | 111,047                        | 118,576      |\n| Kayath      | 80,927                         | 98,381       |\n| Baniya      | 91,669                         | 111,450      |\n| Khatri      | 6,608                          | 11,095       |\n| Goshain      | 9,581                          | 1,821        |\n| Garariya    | 2,394                          | 323          |\n| Bohra       |                                 | 4,019        |\n| Bhil        |                                 | 405          |\n| Son\u00e1r       |                                 | 68           |\n| Sarangi     |                                 | 215          |\n| Lodha       |                                 | 16,180       |\n| Ahir        |                                 | 5,752        |\n| Europeans   |                                 | 13,685       |\n| Nau-Muslim  |                                 | 47,828       |\n| Mughal      |                                 | 7,873        |\n| Path\u00e1n      |                                 | 135,261      |\n| Shaikh      |                                 | 11,970       |\n| Fakir       |                                 | 882          |\n| Mewati      |                                 | 2,804        |\n| Sayyid      |                                 | 25,279       |\n| Other castes|                                 | 1,373        |\n| Total       |                                 | 1,918,799    |\n\nThis statement does not include 29 estates held free of revenue and comprising 9,998 acres, nor does it give the fate of individual proprietors. J\u00e1ts have bought from J\u00e1ts, Brahmins from Brahmins, and the J\u00e1don Rajp\u00fats of Awa M\u00edsa has laid hold of the patrimony of the Porach Rajp\u00fats of Daryapur and Hussain, but these changes are not shown. J\u00e1ts, Rajp\u00fats, and Brahmins still hold more than one-half the whole district, and though there have been many changes amongst individuals, the relative position of the castes in the proprietary body remains pretty much as it was. At the last settlement Khatis, Baniyas, Bohras, and Europeans, who may fairly be said to represent the speculators in land, held 41,887 acres, or only 3\u00b74 per cent.; they now hold 153,899 acres, or 12\u00b73 per cent. The increase is most marked in the case of the Baniyas. Besides the purely speculative classes, the Nau-Muslim Badg\u00fajars, Path\u00e1ns, Kayaths, and notably the Awa M\u00edsa family, have largely increased their\npossessions by purchase. Altogether the old J\u00e1t and Rajp\u00fat proprietary body has been to a large extent displaced, and Mr. Smith attributes much of this to the severity of the past settlement. Though Mr. Thornton did not over-estimate the assets, yet the proportion of the assets taken by him was too high, and averaged 69 per cent. of the assets of the district. Then, in addition to this, the various cesses for roads, post-offices, schools, patw\u00e1ris and watchmen were put on, so that the proprietor seldom had more than 25 per cent. of the assets. In the talukad\u00e1ri estates the proprietor had, in addition, to pay the malik\u00e1na allowance of the taluksd\u00e1r. \u201cHad there been a large margin of culturable waste, the zam\u00ednd\u00e1rs would probably have been able to hold out; but this was not the case. The increase in cultivation, during the 30 years, has been only 7 per cent., and there is now in most tahsils little enough left even for the pasturage of cattle. The cultivated area at the present time is 88 per cent. of the culturable; while, therefore, prices and rents were low, as they remained for many years after last revision, it was difficult for all and impossible for some proprietors to keep out of debt. Many were ruined at once, others held on for years by means of mortgages and loans, which only increased their liabilities, until at last they were obliged to succumb. Those who have survived the struggle are prosperous enough, and the new proprietors are to a large extent men of wealth and position; but the history of this settlement supplies strong grounds for a conviction that the demand of 69 or 70 per cent. of the assets as the share of the State, if assessed with care and rigidly collected, is far too high to be imposed with safety.\u201d The following table gives the official return of transfers from 1868-69 to 1872-73:\n\n| Year | Under Orders of Court | By Private Transfer |\n|------|-----------------------|---------------------|\n|      | Sale                  |                     |\n|      | Number of cases       | Number of cases     |\n|      | Aggregate rent of property transferred | Aggregate rent of property transferred |\n|      | Total number of cases |                     |\n|      | Succession cases      | Mortgage, &c., number of cases |\n|      | Total number of cases |                     |\n| 1868-69 | 90 | 4,243 | 77 | 167 | 159 | 4,872 | 534 | 355 | 948 |\n| 1869-70 | 87 | 10,428 | 47 | 134 | 160 | 8,850 | 606 | 253 | 1,019 |\n| 1870-71 | 57 | 740 | 39 | 96 | 105 | 3,491 | 601 | 189 | 886 |\n| 1871-72 | 119 | 6,095 | 4 | 133 | 164 | 18,431 | 684 | 474 | 1,922 |\n| 1872-73 | 78 | 9,907 | 49 | 127 | 131 | 15,772 | 622 | 401 | 1,154 |\nThe following table shows the results of each mode of transfer of each class during each decade of the last settlement (1838 to 1868) derived from the settlement records:\n\n| Mode of transfer | Area transferred in acres | Land-revenue in rupees | Price in rupees | Price per acre in rupees | Year's purchase |\n|------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|----------------|--------------------------|----------------|\n| **1839-48**      |                           |                        |                |                          |                |\n| Private sale     | 50,997                    | 71,946                 | 3,79,100       | 7 6 11                   | 52             |\n| Mortgage         | 104,581                   | 1,52,764               | 4,54,837       | 4 1 0                    | 27             |\n| Public sale      | 76,047                    | 1,14,861               | 4,79,296       | 6 4 10                   | 41             |\n| Total            | 231,575                   | 3,39,571               | 12,83,333      | 5 8 8                    | 37             |\n| **1849-58**      |                           |                        |                |                          |                |\n| Private sale     | 68,597                    | 1,04,057               | 6,51,998       | 9 8 0                    | 63             |\n| Mortgage         | 75,347                    | 1,10,807               | 5,84,842       | 7 12 2                   | 52             |\n| Public sale      | 45,467                    | 76,186                 | 3,40,985       | 7 0 4                    | 44             |\n| Total            | 190,411                   | 2,91,050               | 15,77,925      | 8 3 1                    | 54             |\n| **1859-68**      |                           |                        |                |                          |                |\n| Private sale     | 103,194                   | 1,57,815               | 12,59,661      | 13 8 8                   | 70             |\n| Mortgage         | 88,367                    | 1,43,994               | 9,81,177       | 11 1 7                   | 68             |\n| Public sale      | 59,514                    | 98,898                 | 4,54,958       | 7 10 8                   | 46             |\n| Total            | 251,075                   | 4,00,539               | 26,95,776      | 10 11 9                  | 67             |\n\nDuring the second decade the average price shows an increase of 47 per cent. over the prices ruling from 1839 to 1848, whilst the price obtained in the third decade is 93 per cent. above that obtained in the first ten years. It may be noted that the increase obtained at auction sales is very small, and that if this item be eliminated from the account, we find that land changed hands during the first decade at Rs. 5-2-8 per acre, and at 3\u00bd years' purchase of the land-revenue. During the last decade the averages were Rs. 11-11-1 per acre and 7-4 years' purchase\u2014that is, these last ten years exhibit an average increase of 126 per cent. in price and 111 per cent. in the number of years' purchase. The cause of the lower price at auction sales is undoubtedly the dread of future litigation as to the rights or interests purchased, or the fear lest some claimant with a prior lien should spring up. For this reason Mr. Smith considers that private sales and mortgages more correctly show the actual increase in the value of land. \"By common consent six or seven per cent. is considered a fair return for investment in land. Suppose, then, a man buys a village assessed now with a revenue of Rs. 1,000. Under existing arrangements the rental in full should be Rs. 2,000. From this must be deducted the land-revenue of Rs. 1,000; cesses at ten per cent. of the land-revenue, Rs. 100; patw\u00e1ris' fees at five per cent.\nRs. 50; and, as the purchaser is generally a non-resident, Rs. 50 for expenses of collection. His full profits will therefore be Rs. 800. Assuming this sum to represent six or seven per cent. on the outlay, the buyer will have had to pay from Rs. 11,400 to Rs. 13,300 for the estate; in other words, from about 11\u00bd to 13 years' purchase of the land-revenue. Special reasons will, of course, at times greatly enhance the value of any particular village, but in average cases the above estimate is not far from the truth. Even during the last decade of the settlement, in certain parganas where the revenue was not heavy and the assessment pretty evenly distributed, as much as this was paid; as, for instance, in Atrauli, where private sales were effected at an average of 11\u00b77 years' purchase, in Akabad all kinds of sales at 11 years, in Sikandra private sales again at 11\u00b72. It is quite certain that the value of land has not decreased since 1868.\"\n\nIn the early days of British rule, as shown in the history of the fiscal arrangements, the land had no value and found no purchasers, but as soon as Mr. Thornton's settlement established the various rights in land and placed a limit on the Government demand, land began to have a marketable value, and as the character and importance of our fiscal laws became better known, this value increased until now, as shown above, land which sold for Rs. 7-6-11 per acre in the first decade of the last settlement brought over Rs. 12 in the last decade. And this increase in the value is progressing, as land is becoming more and more, every day, a favourite investment of capitalists.\n\nGrain, cotton, indigo, indigo-seed, and to a small extent oil-seeds, form the principal articles of export. Though much of the grain is consumed in the district itself, still there usually exists a considerable surplus which is collected in the larger marts and disposed of by the grain-dealers. Much of the surplus grain goes down-country and to Rajputana by the Makanpur ghat on the Jumna. A great proportion of the grain actually consumed in the district also is first collected in the hands of the grain-dealers, and is then distributed according to the demand. The principal marts are Hathras, Koil, Atrauli, Sikandra Rao, and Harduanganj, and the imports of grain into those towns will be found under the notices of them in the alphabetical arrangement hereafter. The exports of food-grains by rail from March, 1871, to April, 1872, amounted to 18,955 maunds. In 1872-73 Aligarh alone exported 92,899 maunds, and Hathras exported 17,150 maunds. During the same year the canal carried off 6,838 maunds. The trade to Rajputana is entirely by cart and has not been registered. The imports into Rewari in the Gurgaon District through Palwal and Delhi from these provinces amounted to Rs. 4,47,962 in 1870-71. Most of this traffic passes through the Aligarh and Muttra Districts. Allowing three-quarters of a ser, or one and a half pounds, of grain per diem as the food allowance per head of the population, we find that 7,344,083 maunds represent\nthe annual consumption of food-grains. In a former page the estimate of\nthe annual production of food grains is set down at 9,367,652 maunds, and\nthus a margin amounting to 2,023,569 maunds is left to meet seed, fodder, and\nexport requirements. Mr. Smith estimates one-fourteenth of the total produce,\nor 669,118 maunds, as the seed requirements, which would leave 1,354,451\nmaunds of food-grains for cattle, reserves, and exportation. Nearly all the\nrain-crops, except the pulses, are consumed locally, and the exports are confined\nto wheat, barley, bejar, gram, and the pulses. Cotton cultivation has increased\nof late years to such an extent as to make it one of the characteristic products\nof the district. Mr. Smith estimates the yield from the acreage under cotton\nat the settlement as 239,430 maunds of 82lbs., or\nCotton. 19,154,000lbs. The population, according to the cen-\nsus of 1872, is 1,073,108 souls, and allowing a local consumption of two pounds\nper head, there would still be left for exportation 212,603 maunds. In the\nneighbouring district of Bulandshahr, Kunwar Lachhman Singh estimated\nthree pounds of cleaned cotton as the average consumption per head, of which two\npounds consist of country cloth and one pound of foreign cloth. Mr. Smith\nremarks:\u2014\u201cNearly every one of the great mass of the Hind\u00fas, who constitute\n89 per cent. of the total population, buys at least one new dhoti of country\ncloth every year, and a dhoti weighs from about 2\u00bd to 3\u00bdlbs. The poorer\nclasses, too, wear jackets of the same cloth, and in this part of the country\nthere are few without a large cloth or dopatta to cover themselves with, besides.\nWith women\u2019s langas and dopattas taken into consideration, the estimate seems\nlow, even though imported cloth is largely used.\u201d From April, 1872, to the\nend of March, 1873, the export of cotton by rail from Aligarh (63,649 maunds)\nand H\u00e1thras (50,518 maunds) amounted to 114,167 maunds, whilst 45,930\nmaunds passed down by the canal to Cawnpore. This gives a total of 160,097\nmaunds without counting the considerable traffic by road and river. The exports\nby rail during the previous year amounted to 146,441 maunds, and estimating\nthe canal export at the amount registered in 1872-73, the total exports during\n1871-72 by canal and rail reach the high figure of 192,000 maunds. The register\nof traffic passing down the Grand Trunk Road by Bhongaon in the Mainpuri\ndistrict, from October, 1870, to July, 1871, shows that 253,180 maunds of cotton\npassed down by cart alone from Aligarh and the north. During the year from\n1st April, 1870, to the end of March, 1871, 32,914 maunds of cotton were sent\nby river from places above Cawnpore on the Ganges to places below Cawnpore,\nand 1,77,500 maunds of cotton passed through the Jhusi bridge-of-boats at\nAllahabad. These facts show that the road and river traffic must be consider-\n\n---\n\n1 The following statement of the canal traffic (in maunds) downwards to Cawnpore during\n1872-73, will show its character; there was no upward traffic:\u2014Wheat, 2,892; Arhar, 2,468;\nMung, 484; Oilseeds, 2391; Bejar, 1,650; Cotton, 45,930; Salt, 6958; Miscellaneous, 3,838.\nable, and support Mr. Smith's high estimate of the local produce, which nearly equals the outturn from the whole of Rohilkhand. Cotton presses are to be found in many of the large townships, and several in Koil itself and H\u00e2thras.\n\nThe following table shows the average price of cleaned cotton per maund in rupees annas and pies for different periods from 1828 to 1873 in this district:\n\n| Rise in price of cotton | 1828-36 | 1837-40 | 1844-53 | 1854-63 | 1864-73 | 1874-75 |\n|------------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Rs. a. p.              | 6 0 0   | 6 8 0   | 7 12 4  | 11 9 4  | 14 0 0  | 7 9 5   |\n|                        |         |         |         |         |         | 14 5 0  |\n\nThe increase in 1854-63 over 1844-53 amounts to 49 per cent., and the last decade (1846-73) shows an increase of 20 per cent. over the previous decade, and 80 per cent. over the first decade (1844-53). The increase in price since the mutiny has been 88 per cent., or very nearly double what it was for seventeen years before, and if we take the Koil rates since 1828, the price has more than doubled. During the last four years the prices have been Rs. 14\u00bd, 15, 12\u00bd, and 13\u00bd per maund, and even allowing for the difference between market and harvest rates, this rate is high enough to pay the cultivators well, and to ensure the cultivation of much above the present area devoted to the plant.\n\nThe first indigo-planters settled in this district under DeBoigne, the Mar-\n\nHistory of indigo-planting. They were M. Jourdan, who settled at Khair; Mr. Orr at Mendu; Mr. John Thornton at Koil and M\u00e2chhna; Mr. Longcroft at Koil and Jal\u00e2li, and Messrs. Robertson and Stewart at Maloi and Allahd\u00e2dpur. The other factories have been established since the British occupation in 1803. M. Jourdan died at Aligarh, and one of the monuments in the grounds of the late Judge's house is believed to mark his grave. Mr. Thornton also died there in 1848. His house was the same as that lately purchased by Mr. Bramly and presented to the Aligarh Dispensary. Mr. Longcroft lived where the garden of Badari Parshad is now situated. Mr. Stewart removed to Calcutta, and was succeeded at Allahd\u00e2dpur by Mr. Hashman, whilst Mr. Orr went to Lakhwa in Oudh. The S\u00e2ni factories were built after the conquest by Mr. R. Carruthers from the ruins of the fort of S\u00e2ni; Chotwa was built in 1806 by Mr. George Mercer; Barla and An\u00fbpshahr at the same time, and Mr. George Blunt formed the H\u00e2thras factory in 1817. During this time indigo-planting flourished. Mr. W. Morton, formerly a captain in the Bengal Engineers, introduced a system by which the tahsild\u00e2rs or sub-collectors of the land-revenue contracted with the European planters\n\n---\n\n1 From notes by Mr. W. Connor, Honorary Magistrate, and an anonymous letter in the Delhi Gazette, 1874.\nfor supplying the green indigo plant. Under this system the tahsildars received the advances made by the planters and applied them to meet the land-revenue due from the estate. They, moreover, managed the cultivation, and were rewarded by presents both from the factory and from Government. Notwithstanding the general prosperity of indigo speculators, there were many serious obstacles to successful trade during the Marhatta administration; chief amongst these was the number and excessive nature of the tolls on exports. Indigo and cotton, then, as now, the chief exports, used to be shipped at Farukhabad for Calcutta, but had to pay the following duties on their way to the river:\u2014to the Koil authorities from Koil to Jaljali; to the S\u00e1ni Raja from Jaljali to Sikandra Rao; to the Kachaura Th\u00e1kur from Sikandra Rao to Eta; to the Eta Raja from Eta to Kar\u00e1oli; and to the Mainpuri Raja from Kar\u00e1oli to Bhongon. These dues were all abolished by the British, and remissions of revenue were allowed in lieu of them to the several petty Rajas. The indigo trade prospered until 1830, when the failure of the Calcutta houses involved the Aligarh factories in their ruin. Many valuable estates and enormous outstanding debts were sold by auction for very inadequate prices in 1834. The purchasers were chiefly hangers-on about the Courts, pleaders and money-lenders who bided their time, and when things began to look better, pressed for the debts that they had purchased, and in this manner acquired, at auction sale, under their own decrees many villages from the people indebted to the factories. Hence the numerous shares and fractions of shares in villages in the hands of the money-lending classes in this district. The indigo trade revived a little in 1862, but soon fell again, and though the area under indigo has increased very much of late years, it has never equalled the area previous to 1830. The withdrawal of the Europeans from the indigo trade was a great loss to the district, and gave its prosperity a shock from which it has hardly yet recovered. Though the native manufacture has increased so much, yet natives look more to quantity than quality, and even now their indigo averages only Rs. 120 per maund, where indigo from a neighbouring factory grown on similar soil, but manufactured under European superintendence, brings Rs. 180 per maund.\n\nThe district is now literally studded with factories. The following statement shows that there were 171 factories, producing 3,625 maunds of marketable indigo, in 1873:\n\n| Tahsil | Number of factories | Produce in maunds |\n|--------|---------------------|------------------|\n| Koil   | 89                  | 695              |\n| Sikandra | 91               | 1,799            |\n| Atrauli | 16                | 162              |\n\n| Tahsil | Number of factories | Produce in maunds |\n|--------|---------------------|------------------|\n| Khair  | 18                  | 276              |\n| Igias  | 5                   | 167              |\n| Hathras | 6                 | 248              |\nThe quantity of indigo annually produced in the Upper Provinces was reckoned by Mr. Stirling in 1830 at an average crop of 20,000 maunds, and this at Rs. 200 per maund made the value of the annual supply of indigo about 40 lakhs of rupees. The effect of the abstraction of this sum from the general commerce of the country must have been immense, for it did not find investment in other channels; it was a sort of foreign capital which nourished so long as it lasted, but did not take root in the country. We have some means of testing the local estimate of produce. The imports of indigo into Riwari in 1869-70 was 106 maunds, and in 1870-71 was 273 maunds; more than one-half of this may be credited to Aligarh, or, say, about 150 maunds per annum.\n\nThen we have the returns of the Calcutta brokers (W. Moran & Co.), which for the European factories give the following results for eleven years; the output is shown in chests which average about 3\u00bd factory maunds of 74 lbs. 10 oz. 10-666 dr. avoirdupois each. The price is per factory maund, and the minimum and maximum rate of exchange is also given:\n\n| Factory | 1863-64, Exchange, 2s. 1\u00bdd. to 2s. 3\u00bdd. | 1864-65, Exchange, 2s. 1\u00bdd. to 2s. 3\u00bdd. | 1865-66, Exchange, 2s. 1\u00bdd. to 2s. 3\u00bdd. | 1866-67, Exchange, 1s. 10\u00bdd. to 2s. 1\u00bdd. | 1867-68, Exchange, 1s. 10\u00bdd. to 1s. 11\u00bdd. | 1868-69, Exchange, 1s. 11\u00bdd. to 2s. 0\u00bdd. |\n|---------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Chests  | Price per maund.                     | Price per maund.                     | Price per maund.                     | Price per maund.                     | Price per maund.                     | Price per maund.                     |\n| Rs. a.  | Rs. a.                               | Rs. a.                               | Rs. a.                               | Rs. a.                               | Rs. a.                               | Rs. a.                               |\n| Bela    | 143                                  | 144 12                               | 209                                  | 168 12                               | 276                                  | 168 12                               |\n| Hathras | 33                                   | 136 0                                | 24                                    | 164 8                                | 26                                    | 173 0                                |\n| N.W.

The accounts of the brokers show the native manufacture of the Du\u00e1b and Rohilkhand under one head as follows (in factory maunds):\n\n| Year | 1863 | 1864 | 1865 | 1866 | 1867 | 1868 | 1869 | 1870 | 1871 | 1872 |\n|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Outturn | ... | 1,781 | 3,983 | 4,574 | 4,716 | 10,148 | 9,995 | 23,876 | 15,028 | 18,317 | 11,000 |\n\nIt will be seen from this that there has been an extraordinary advance in cultivation by natives during the last ten years, and examining all the data before us, there is much reason to believe that the local estimate is far under the real outturn. Taking the area under indigo, and allowing 42 maunds of green plant per acre and 325 maunds of the green plant to one maund of manufactured indigo, the outturn should show 3,749 maunds of indigo. This too, though it has been proved that the area under indigo has been considerably understated in the settlement returns. Tahsil Atrauli shows only 162 maunds; whilst the Barla concern alone, for the same year, turned out 351 maunds, or more than double the estimate given for the whole tahsil.\n\nThe local prices for the green plant at the Barla concern for a series of years, both for badni (or advance terms) and khush khard (or ready market prices) in rupees per 100 maunds has been as follows:\n\n| From | Advance | Cash price | From | Advance | Cash price | For | Advance | Cash price | For | Advance | Cash price |\n|------|---------|------------|------|---------|------------|-----|---------|------------|-----|---------|------------|\n| 1887-58 | 16\u201419 | 21\u201424 | 1859-65 | 19\u201433 | 28 | 1870... | 20\u201424 | 26\u201430 | 1873... | 30\u201428 | 30 |\n| 1857-58 | 20 | 23 | 1866-69 | 20\u201424 | 26\u201438 | 1871... | 20\u201426 | 26\u201430 | 1873... | 30\u201428 | 30 |\n\n\"Badni is an arrangement for the supply of plant to be furnished at a fixed price at the time of manufacture, on consideration of an advance of money at the time of the arrangement; khush khard is plant sold at the time of manufacture by the cultivator who has planted it on speculation. Taking the highest prices paid, we find that the price has risen for badni plant from Rs. 19 per 100 maunds in 1837 to Rs. 28 in 1873, or 47 per cent., and for khush khard from Rs. 24 to 30, or 25 per cent. This rise in the price of indigo plant especially illustrates the rise in the rentable value of land, for though the price of plant has considerably increased and the increased price in badni operations has been\nmaintained this year, yet last year was conspicuous for an enormous fall in\nthe price of manufactured indigo, and it was not expected that it would be\nmuch higher when the sales took place this cold weather (1873). Whether the\nmanufacturer, erroneously called the planter in this district, gains or loses, the\ncultivator gets a price for plant, which enables him to pay a higher rent than\nwas exacted from him in past years.\" The Calcutta prices for the manufac-\ntured dye have been given on a previous page. As a rule, the D\u00fa\u00e1b indigo is\ninferior to that of the Benares Division, whilst the latter is inferior to the\nBengal and T\u00edrh\u00fat plant. Prices during 1872-73 for gand and low native\nindigo ruled from Rs. 75 to Rs. 105 per maund; for ordinary and middling\nplant quality (European and native) Rs. 115 to Rs. 150, and for good quality\nRs. 180 to Rs. 200. A few European factories turn out indigo of very supe-\nrior quality, and some few lots of these particular marks sold as high as Rs. 220\nto Rs. 250, and one lot as high as Rs. 247-8-0. Prices during 1872-73 ruled\nfrom Rs. 85 to Rs. 100 per maund below those of the previous year. A consider-\nable amount of indigo seed is sent to Bengal, but as most of this traffic passes\nby boat down the Ganges, there are no accurate returns in existence for judg-\ning of its real importance.\n\nOil-seeds were exported in 1871-72 by rail to the amount of Rs. 61,145\nmaunds, and in 1872-73 there were 54,480 maunds sent\nout of the district by rail and 2,391 maunds by the\ncanal. This trade centres in H\u00e1thras and Koil.\n\nIn 1856 there were 37 saltpetre manufactories in the district, producing\nabout 50,000 maunds per annum. In 1872-73 the\noutturn was only 25,000 maunds, but the num-\nber of refineries has increased from two in 1856 to sixteen in 1873, with\nan outturn of 10,190 maunds of refined saltpetre, valued at Rs. 6 per\nmaund, or Rs. 61,140. Crude saltpetre is valued at Rs. 3-6-0 per maund, so\nthat the entire value of this manufacture, all of which is exported, is nearly a\nlakh and a half of rupees. The returns of the five municipalities in the district\nshow the imports very fairly. They consist of sugar, rice, European cloth\ngoods, spices, metals, tobacco, rice, timber, bambus, and pedlar's wares gene-\nrally. The details there given show the extent of the external trade of the\ndistrict and the importance of H\u00e1thras as a distributing centre of commerce\nfor this and the surrounding districts. The line of railway under construc-\ntion from H\u00e1thras to Muttra and from the East Indian Railway to the town\nof H\u00e1thras will still further raise its position as one of the most flourishing\nmarts of the upper D\u00fa\u00e1b; and if to these lines be added the projected line\nfrom H\u00e1thras by K\u00e1sganj to the Ganges, Aligarh will be better off in the\nway of communication by road, rail, canal and river than many counties in\nEngland.\nThe following table shows the goods and passenger traffic on the East Indian Railway for one year, and is sufficient to exhibit the relative importance of each station:\n\n| Month | HATHRAS | PALL | ALIGARH | SONNA |\n|-------|---------|------|---------|-------|\n|       | Goods   | Passengers | Goods   | Passengers | Goods   | Passengers | Goods   | Passengers |\n|       | Inwards | Outwards | Inwards | Outwards | Inwards | Outwards | Inwards | Outwards |\n|       | Rs.     | Rs.     | Rs.     | Rs.     | Rs.     | Rs.     | Rs.     | Rs.     |\n| January 1971 | 38,000 | 20,587 | 3,620 | 706 | 150 | 100 | 13,543 | 10,144 | 7,283 | 48 | 360 | 667 |\n| February | 35,023 | 22,883 | 3,620 | 719 | 561 | 350 | 10,466 | 11,293 | 7,302 | 75 | ... | 663 |\n| March    | 30,111 | 21,549 | 3,620 | 729 | 561 | 350 | 10,466 | 11,293 | 7,302 | 75 | ... | 663 |\n| April    | 41,280 | 25,926 | 3,620 | 747 | 944 | 190 | 20,760 | 7,710 | 7,290 | 6 | ... | 643 |\n| May      | 39,208 | 25,058 | 3,620 | 772 | 1,024 | 146 | 8,484 | 3,906 | 6,223 | 8 | ... | 643 |\n| June     | 39,208 | 25,058 | 3,620 | 772 | 1,024 | 146 | 8,484 | 3,906 | 6,223 | 8 | ... | 643 |\n| July     | 11,617 | 10,069 | 2,549 | 263 | 690 | 76 | 6,535 | 6,314 | 3,244 | 16 | ... | 597 |\n| August   | 9,451 | 11,367 | 8,614 | 263 | 690 | 76 | 6,535 | 6,314 | 3,244 | 16 | ... | 597 |\n| September| 17,320 | 12,624 | 2,108 | 99 | 245 | 76 | 3,670 | 2,979 | 2,900 | 16 | ... | 529 |\n| October  | 24,955 | 20,120 | 2,108 | 99 | 245 | 76 | 3,670 | 2,979 | 2,900 | 16 | ... | 529 |\n| November | 28,928 | 40,670 | 5,357 | 8 | 819 | 154 | 14,307 | 8,191 | 8,711 | 3 | 323 | 364 |\n| December | 28,408 | 44,546 | 5,357 | 192 | 900 | 151 | 32,904 | 42,714 | 7,978 | 84 | 6 | 469 |\n\nTotal, | 8,15,839 | 8,08,415 | 57,820 | 3,718 | 8,830 | 1,415 | 17,838 | 14,603 | 8,421 | 104 | 1,674 | 5,833 |\n\nFrom the 17th to the 23rd October the Ramliia religious fair is held in most of the large towns in the district, and about 12,000 persons come into Koil for its celebration during this period. Similarly at the Musalm\u00e1n festival of the Muharram large crowds assemble at the principal shrines. In September the Hind\u00fas hold a fair at Barhad, near Sikandra Rao, in honour of Raghun\u00e1thji, where some 8,000 people assemble, and a small trade in mules, asses, leather buckets for water and wooden utensils is carried on. The bar\u00e1ha fair during the last week in October attracts some small assemblages of people in the large Hind\u00fa towns. Sweetmeats, toys, European and country cloths are the staple articles of trade at these fairs, and none of them are large enough to assist, in any way, in the spread of contagious diseases. The only places where special police and sanitary arrangements are necessary are the Koil and H\u00e1thras Muharram fairs, the Koil Ramliia fair, and the Sikandra fair. Of the mere market towns the most important are S\u00e1sni, Akrahad, Bijaiagarh, Gangtiri, Teppal and Khair; but small market towns exist everywhere. Excluding the municipal towns there are 180 markets in the district: 26 in tahsil Sikandra Rao, 43 in H\u00e1thras, 34 in Koil, 31 in Igl\u00e1s, 23 in Atrauli, and 23 in Khair, or one to every ten villages and to every 5,961 persons. Cattle, grain, country cloth, vegetables, sweetmeats, toys,\nbrass utensils, and the numerous articles of domestic consumption are the chief commodities of trade.\n\nFor corals and pearls the weights used are: 12 grains of rice make one rati, and 24 ratias make one tank, which is equivalent to\n\nWeights and measures. 2 dwts. 19 grains Troy. For weighing gold and silver, 8 grains of rice go to the rati, 8 ratias to the m\u00e1sha, and 12 m\u00e1shas to the tola, equivalent to 7 dwts. 12 grains Troy. The common bazar weight for goods is 5 tolas make one chhat\u00e1k, and 16 chhat\u00e1ks one ser, weighing 2 lbs. 6 oz. Troy; 40 sers make one maund; a smaller ser containing with three tolas to the chhat\u00e1k, and 9 chhat\u00e1ks to the ser makes the latter only 1 lb. 6ozs. Troy, and the maund of 24 sers known as a kuchcha maund. In selling unrefined saltpetre a ser of 16 chhat\u00e1ks, with 7\u00bd tolas to each, or weighing 3 lbs. 9 ozs. Troy is used. Indigo and refined saltpetre are weighed with a ser, of which the chhat\u00e1ks weigh 6\u00bd tolas each; the ser therefore weighs 3 lbs. 2 ozs. 5 dwts. The ser of 80 tolas is now generally used, but in H\u00e1thras and Koil metals and spices are sold at the ser of 85 tolas, called the ser of 28 taka of Jaipur or Bharatpur piec.\n\nThe linear measures for cloth gives a yard of 36 inches divided into two h\u0101ths or cubits, each of which contains three giras, which are again subdivided into three angasht or digits. Masons and carpenters use the mi\u00fam\u00e1ri yard of 2 feet 9 inches, in which 12 thread breadths make one tasti and 24 tastis make one yard. The Il\u00e1hi gaz or yard is generally used for all purposes, including stone-cutter's work, land-measuring, cloth-measuring, &c. It contains 33 British inches, and a bigha of land measured with this yard is exactly five-eighths of an acre. Two Il\u00e1hi yards make one dand, and 2,500 dands make one kos. In the official measurement of land, at the settlement of 1838 the jarbi gaz amounted to 2 feet 7\u00bd inches; one span or eight digits made one kuri, and three links made one jarbi gaz or yard, and eight yards made one gatta, and twenty gattas made one jarbi.\n\nThe subdivisions of a bigha are as follows:\u201420 nanw\u00e1nsi = 1 kachw\u00e1nsi; 20 kachw\u00e1nsi = 1 bisw\u00e1nsi; 20 bisw\u00e1nsi = 1 biswa; and 20 biswa = 1 bigha. Here the local bigha of the greater part of the district is equivalent to 2,756\u00b725 square yards or 0\u00b75694 of an acre; 1\u00b77560 bighas make one acre. The standard or Shahjah\u00e1n\u00ed bigha used in a few villages annexed from Bulandshahr is equivalent to 3,025 square yards, or 0\u00b7625 of an acre. The Government have adopted the British acre for all purposes. Three kuchcha bighas are equivalent to one pukka bigha. In the early days of our rule rupees coined at different places were current in the district. The following are the rates established in 1805 for their conversion into Lucknow rupees, then considered the standard rupee:\u2014Farukhabad, Rs. 1\u00b78\u00b71 per cent.; H\u00e1thras, Rs. 2\u00b79\u00b74; Muttra, Rs. 8\u00b73\u00b77; Dig, Rs. 12\u00b71\u00b70, and Brindaban, Rs. 16\u00b77\u00b72.\n\n1 The taka is equal to two Jaipur piec.\nThe following statement shows the prices of the chief agricultural products in this district for the years 1861 to 1870 in *ser* of Prices.\n\n|                      | 1861 | 1862 | 1863 | 1864 | 1865 | 1866 | 1867 | 1868 | 1869 | 1870 |\n|----------------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Paddy                | 28   | 27   | 29   | 30   | 26   | 29   | 25   | 25   | 16   | 15   |\n| Common rice (husked) | 134  | 15   | 14   | 14   | 12   | 10   | 134  | 134  | 124  | 114  |\n| Best rice (husked)   | 9    | 10   | 9    | 9    | 8    | 7    | 9    | 8    | 8    | 7    |\n| Wheat                | 164  | 85   | 26   | 24   | 18   | 19   | 24   | 25   | 16   | 18   |\n| Barley               | 20   | 48   | 33   | 31   | 26   | 26   | 33   | 33   | 28   | 30   |\n| Bajra                | 21   | 36   | 35   | 32   | 27   | 26   | 38   | 37   | 42   | 33   |\n| Jodr                 | 21   | 35   | 26   | 26   | 26   | 27   | 30   | 30   | 33   | 26   |\n| Indian-corn          | 30   | 37   | 37   | 36   | 35   | 35   | 35   | 35   | 35   | 35   |\n| Urd                  | 21   | 34   | 32   | 31   | 15   | 20   | 24   | 22   | 9    | 10   |\n| Mung                 | 19   | 30   | 30   | 15   | 18   | 24   | 28   | 20   | 15   | 24   |\n| Arhar                | 27   | 27   | 32   | 35   | 33   | 32   | 40   | 33   | 35   | 40   |\n| Moth                 | 30   | 29   | 28   | 26   | 25   | 25   | 25   | 25   | 25   | 25   |\n| Gram                 | 18   | 32   | 29   | 26   | 23   | 24   | 20   | 26   | 16   | 19   |\n| Lentils              | 16   | 32   | 34   | 24   | 23   | 23   | 35   | 35   | 35   | 35   |\n| Clean cotton         | 34   | 31   | 31   | 31   | 31   | 31   | 31   | 31   | 31   | 31   |\n| Sugar (raw)          | 24   | 34   | 34   | 34   | 34   | 34   | 34   | 34   | 34   | 34   |\n| Sugar (refined)      | 24   | 34   | 34   | 34   | 34   | 34   | 34   | 34   | 34   | 34   |\n| Salt                 | 7    | 7    | 6    | 6    | 6    | 6    | 6    | 6    | 6    | 6    |\n| Ghi                  | 14   | 9    | 9    | 9    | 9    | 9    | 9    | 9    | 9    | 9    |\n| Til seed             | 12   | 11   | 10   | 15   | 18   | 14   | 14   | 11   | 10   | 12   |\n| Mustard seed         | 15   | 14   | 13   | 13   | 12   | 12   | 12   | 12   | 12   | 12   |\n\nIn connection with his inquiries into the effects of the rise in prices on the rental of the district, Mr. W. H. Smith gives some valuable notes on the rise of prices in general throughout the district. He shows that there has been a considerable and steady rise in the price of the four standard grains\u2014wheat, barley, jodr, and bajra. The following table is arranged in periods from 1828 to 1870-71, and the percentages of the rise or fall of price in each period as compared with the other are calculated. The *ser* of 80 *tolas* is used throughout:\n\n| Grain | 1828-37 | 1838-49 | 1850-61 | 1862-70 | 1871-78 | 1879-81 | 1882-89 | 1890-97 | 1898-1905 | 1906-1913 |\n|-------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|-----------|-----------|\n| Wheat | S.

C.   | Fall.     | Fall.     |\nFrom the above it will be seen that from 1827 to 1858 prices ruled very low; and that since the mutiny there has been a great and permanent rise. The first decade of all includes the famine of 1837, and the famine of 1868-69 is left out of the calculation of percentages. The prices of 1870-71, though lower than those of the two preceding years, are higher than the average of the decade preceding the mutiny, and the tendency is still on the side of rise. With the present improved communications this must continue, and can only change in an unusually good season. The prices of cotton and indigo are given under the head of 'trade,' and need not be further noticed here.\n\nThe present rates of daily wages of artizans are:\u2014For blacksmiths, carpenters and masons five annas; labourers as beld\u00e1rs, 2\u00bd to 3 annas; coolies 2, women 1\u00bd, and boys 1\u00bd annas. The wages of agricultural day labourers are about 2 annas, and in addition half a ser of chapatis or unleavened bread, or the same quantity of grain. Weeders receive 3 annas a day and the grass they pick out, which is often worth 2 annas more. The following statement shows the official returns as to wages for six years after the mutiny:\n\n| Year | Near Koll. | In the District. | Near Koll. | In the District. | Near Koll. | In the District. | Near Koll. | In the District. |\n|------|------------|------------------|------------|------------------|------------|------------------|------------|------------------|\n| 1858 |            |                  |            |                  |            |                  |            |                  |\n| 1860 |            |                  |            |                  |            |                  |            |                  |\n| 1862 |            |                  |            |                  |            |                  |            |                  |\n| 1864 |            |                  |            |                  |            |                  |            |                  |\n| 1866 |            |                  |            |                  |            |                  |            |                  |\n| 1874 |            |                  |            |                  |            |                  |            |                  |\n\n- Beld\u00e1rs\n- Bhiatis\n- Kah\u00e1rs\n- Tailors\n- Washermen\n- Blacksmiths\n- Barbers\n- Carders\n- Carpenters\n- Dyers\n- Goldsmiths\n- Shoe-makers\n- Grooms\n- Masons\n- Tile-makers\n- Brick-layers\n- Bracelet-makers\n- Painters\nThe following statement sufficiently explains the revenue and civil expenditure of this district for the years 1860-61 and 1870-71:\n\n| Receipts | 1860-61 | 1870-71 | Expenditure | 1860-61 | 1870-71 |\n|----------|---------|---------|-------------|---------|---------|\n| Rs.      | Rs.     | Rs.     | Rs.         | Rs.     | Rs.     |\n| Land-revenue | 17,92,903 | 19,66,550 | Revenue charges | 1,21,286 | 1,67,560 |\n| Profit and loss, Revenue Department | 61,611 | ... | Judicial charges | 1,17,766 | 1,09,230 |\n| Stamps | 19,280 | 38,594 | Police charges | 1,31,369 | 78,108 |\n| Revenue charges | 10,625 | ... | General charges | 12,857 | ... |\n| Judicial charges | 37,168 | 1,75,820 | Stamp charges | 4,634 | 7,045 |\n| Police | 1,197 | ... | Mutiny profit and loss | 72,824 | ... |\n| Military profit and loss | 12,796 | ... | Public works | 86,550 | 30,154 |\n| Public works | 2,752 | ... | Fabla works | 18,654 | ... |\n| Income-tax | ... | 99,519 | Profit and loss, Revenue Department | 10,856 | ... |\n| Miscellaneous | ... | ... | Interest and refund | ... | 13,588 |\n| Abkari | ... | 87,043 | Excise and cess | ... | 4,925 |\n| Medical and education, Miscellaneous | ... | ... | ... | ... | 38,180 |\n| Total | 19,78,373 | 28,37,093 | Total | 5,21,465 | 4,84,738 |\n\nThe revenue from December, 1857, to April, 1858, was Rs. 11,46,715, and the expenditure during the same period was Rs. 2,89,551.\n\nThe actual assessment of the income of the district at six pies in the rupee, calculated upon profits exceeding Rs. 500, for the purposes of the income-tax of 1870, during 1870-71, was Rs. 1,25,467.

These figures include immoveable and moveable property, wills, &c., and give the total aggregate values of all the documents registered.\n\nFor the collection of inland customs a post was established at Aligarh under the charge of the Collector of the land-revenue. This was withdrawn under Regulation IX. of 1810, and for the five years of its continuance the total receipts amounted to Rs. 6,25,757,\nand the charges to Rs. 95,246. For the same years the receipts from town duties were Rs. 30,085, and the charges were Rs. 6,344. Subsequently the town duties were farmed, and rose gradually from Rs. 6,200 in 1810 to Rs. 12,500 in 1836, in which year they were abolished, together with inland customs duties. During the ten years 1826-1836 upwards of Rs. 30,345 were expended from these funds in local improvements in Koil alone.\n\nThe excise in this district consists of a tax on the sale of spirituous liquors and intoxicating drugs, which for many years was realised by the system of farming out the taxes by parganahs.\n\nThe following table shows the collections for ten years before the mutiny:\n\n| Year | Amount of lease of liquor vessel | Amount farm of drugs | Amount farm of opium | Total revenue | Collected during the year | Subsequently realised | Remitted by Government |\n|------|---------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|--------------|--------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|\n|      | Rs.                             | Rs.                  | Rs.                  | Rs.          | Rs.                      | Rs.                   | Rs.                    |\n| 1843-44 | ...                           | 11,250               | 3,700                | 2,200        | 17,150                   | 16,936                | 1,108                  |\n| 1844-45 | ...                           | 11,700               | 3,900                | 2,400        | 18,000                   | 16,136                | 1,803                  |\n| 1845-46 | ...                           | 18,050               | 4,825                | 2,735        | 20,000                   | 16,883                | 3,117                  |\n| 1846-47 | ...                           | 12,500               | 4,000                | 2,500        | 18,000                   | 16,201                | 1,799                  |\n| 1847-48 | ...                           | 14,000               | 4,200                | 3,900        | 22,100                   | 19,091                | 3,009                  |\n| 1848-49 | ...                           | 14,851               | 4,099                | 3,701        | 22,650                   | 20,440                | 2,210                  |\n| 1849-50 | ...                           | 15,200               | 4,675                | ...          | 19,775                   | 16,731                | 1,044                  |\n| 1850-51 | ...                           | 17,507               | 4,700                | 3,303        | 25,807                   | 23,512                | 2,195                  |\n| 1851-52 | ...                           | 21,550               | 5,303                | 3,800        | 30,050                   | 27,469                | 2,577                  |\n| 1852-53 | ...                           | 21,550               | 6,050                | 4,000        | 31,600                   | 23,416                | ...                    |\n\nThe consumption of opium rose from nearly six maunds in 1843-44 to 8\u00bd maunds in 1846-47; then falling again, it suddenly rose in 1849-50 to 22 maunds 22\u00bd sers, and in 1852-53 was 22 maunds 27 sers.\n\nThe following table gives the statistics connected with the excise for ten years after the mutiny:\n\n| Year | Licences fees for end of spirits | Duty on spirits | Opium | Madak | Taki | Intoxicating drugs | Fines &c. | Gross charges | Net receipts |\n|------|---------------------------------|----------------|-------|-------|-----|-------------------|-----------|---------------|--------------|\n|      | Rs.                             | Rs.            | Rs.   | Rs.   | Rs. | Rs.               | Rs.       | Rs.           | Rs.          |\n| 1863-64 | ...                           | 945            | 10,862| 18,510| 16  | 35                | 4,745     | ...           | 667         |\n| 1864-65 | ...                           | 3,302          | 9,586 | 14,700| 84  | 45                | 4,813     | 87            | 1,153       |\n| 1865-66 | ...                           | 6,829          | 10,685| 30,160| 275 | 33                | 5,532     | 204           | 11,364      |\n| 1866-67 | ...                           | 6,184          | 11,111| 21,760| 351 | 18                | 4,785     | 196           | 13,847      |\n| 1867-68 | ...                           | 6,971          | 14,518| 24,900| 408 | 7                 | 4,305     | 418           | 16,589      |\n| 1868-69 | ...                           | 8,381          | 14,951| 33,920| 476 | 32                | 7,431     | 107           | 20,848      |\n| 1869-70 | ...                           | 8,595          | 11,064| 24,880| 442 | 69                | 8,103     | 124           | 20,467      |\n| 1870-71 | ...                           | 5,882          | 10,058| 36,272| 478 | 45                | 7,894     | 4             | 21,243      |\n| 1871-72 | ...                           | 6,404          | 10,026| 37,648| 373 | 60                | 10,629    | 99            | 21,425      |\nThe town of Kol or Koil is of undoubtedly great antiquity. Local tradition identifies it with the Kosam or Kosambhi to which Nichakru removed his capital after Hastinapur had been swept away by the Ganges. But Kosambhi has been identified with Kosam on the Jumna near Allahabad, so that this suggestion cannot be accepted. Indeed Ah\u00e1r in the Bulandshahr District and other towns in other districts make similar pretensions. To carry out the story, the founder is said to be a Kshatriya of the lunar race, named Kosh\u00e1ra. The present name was given to the city by B\u00e1l\u00e1rama, who slew here the great Asura (demon) Kol, and with the assistance of the Ahirs subdued this part of the Du\u00e1b. B\u00e1l\u00e1rama is said to have gone from Koil to R\u00e1mgh\u00e1t on the Ganges, where he founded a town, and Hardeva (Harduaganj) is said to have been founded by the Ahirs of R\u00e1m\u00e1's army, and named after another of the many names of their chief (Hardeo). Another legend connects the foundation of Koil with the Dor tribe of Rajp\u00fats, of whom so much has been said in the Bulandshahr District. The story runs that in 429 Sambat (or 372 A.D.) Raja Vikrama Sen, of the Dor tribe, ruled at Baran (Bulandshahr), and his brother K\u00e1l\u00ed held Jal\u00e1li, and both were tributary to Raja Anangp\u00e1l of Dehli. Vikrama Sen had two sons, Indar and Mokindur; the former succeeded his father in Baran, and the latter his uncle at Jal\u00e1li. Mokindur was succeeded by Gobind Sen, and he by N\u00e1har Singh, the founder of Sambhal. After him came his grandson Dasrath Singh, the founder of Jalesar, who, dying childless, was succeeded by his brother Bijai R\u00e1m, and he was followed by Budh Sen. \"One day as Budh Sen was riding from Jal\u00e1li to Dehli, considerably ahead of his followers, he came to a jhil (called in old Hindi 'kol') and dismounted. Whilst waiting for his retinue a fox came up and barked at him, which so irritated the Raja that he drew his sword and struck the fox. The fox retreated to a hole and continued to bark at the Raja and attack him until his suite arrived. After consoling their master, they suggested that there must be some excellent inherent quality in the soil which had imparted to a contemptible creature like the fox, vigour and audacity enough to enable him to set at nought a royal Rajp\u00fat; and that therefore it would be a desirable site for the foundation of a city and fort. Raja Budh Sen, after consulting his astrologer, found that it was an auspicious moment for the purpose, so at once he dug up a little clay from the jhil with his own dagger, and laid the foundation of a city which he named Kol after the jhil. In a few years the fortress and city were finished, and the seat of government was removed from Jal\u00e1li to Koil, which became the capital of a large kingdom, comprising Pati\u00e1li, Jalesar, Budaon, Sambhal, Kampil, and Baran. After a reign of 55 years the Raja was succeeded by his son Mangal Sen.\n\n1 Spelled Kol and pronounced Koil. 2 Bhilsa Topes, Chaps. 2, 3. Arch. Sur., L, 201. 3 Vol. III. of the Gazetteer.\nlatter made an alliance with the Raja Bena of Atranji and Et\u00e1wa, and gave his daughter Padm\u00e1vati in marriage to the heir of the Et\u00e1wa Raja. On Raja Bena's death his sons deposed and murdered their eldest brother, and Padm\u00e1vati returned a widow to her father's house at Koil. She became a devotee of Ganga, and her father built for her a lofty column in the centre of his fortress, from whence she might be able to view daily the sacred river. Another version of the legend is that the unfortunate Padm\u00e1vati was built up alive in this column. It has been shown in the introduction that Anang P\u00e1l cannot have ruled in Dehli earlier than A.D. 736, and the inscription on the column in the fort shows that it was erected in 1253 A.D. by Balban, so both the main facts of the story want corroboration.\n\nThis much, however, may be said, that some time before the Musalm\u00e1n invasion the district was held by the Dor Rajputs, and that in the time of Mahm\u00fad of Ghazni the chief of the Dors was Hardatta of Baran. Koil continued an outpost of the Raja of Baran until the close of the twelfth century, when, weakened by the attacks of the Meos, the Dors fell an easy prey to the Badgujars. Prithir\u00e1j has left an inscription boasting of his victory over the Dors, and the Badgujar traditions all agree in stating their settlement here as due to the grant of 150 villages as dowry with his daughter by the last Dor Raja to Part\u00e1b Singh, the Badgujar leader. The Badgujars were the principal tribe at the time of the Musalm\u00e1n invasion. There is some reason to believe that Koil was once the seat of a Buddhist community. Statues of Buddha and other Buddhist remains have been found in excavations made in the eminence on which the citadel of Koil stood. So also have Hind\u00fa remains indicating that in all probability the citadel contained in succession a Buddhist and a Hind\u00fa temple. As will be seen, these were superseded in their turn by a Muhammadan building (see Koil). For Koil, as for most places in Upper India, authentic history commences with the Muhammadan invasion, and I shall now turn to the Musalm\u00e1n historians, and mention the few events, connected with the district, recorded by them.\n\nIn the year 1194 A.D. Kutb-ud-din marched from Dehli to Koil, \"which,\" writes Hasan Niz\u00e1mi, \"is one of the most celebrated fortresses of Hind. Those who were wise and acute were converted to Isl\u00e1m, but those who stood by their ancient faith were slain with the sword. The nobles and chiefs of the State entered the fort and carried off much treasure and countless plunder, including one thousand horses.\" From Koil the conqueror proceeded to Benares, and on his return occupied himself in chasing a certain tribe in the neighbourhood of the fort, which, \"after the manner of foxes playing with lions, had occasioned much trouble by-\n\n1 Ledlie's Miscellany in Allgarh Statistics, 560. 2 Tejul Ma\u00e1sir in Dowson's Elliot, II., 232-234, 248, 358, 380.\ntheir deceits and stratagems; therefore by the edge of the sword they were despatched to the fire of hell. Three bastions were raised as high as heaven with their heads, and their carcases became the food of beasts of prey. That tract was freed from idols and idol worship, and the foundations of infidelity were destroyed.\" Kutb-ud-din appointed Hisam-ud-din Ulbak as the first Musalm\u00e1n governor of Koil. The conversions boasted of by the Muhammadan writers must have been partial, as few (if any) converted Hind\u00fa families trace back the change in their religion to so early a period.\n\nNiz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk Mahzab-ud-din was governor of Koil in 1242 A.D., during the reign of Sult\u00e1n Ala-ud-d\u00edn Mass\u00fad Shah bis Firuz Shah, but so disgusted the Turki nobles by his insolence and avarice that they caused him to be assassinated. Ten years later there would seem to be some attempt to throw off the Musalm\u00e1n yoke, for we find the great Vaz\u00edr Gh\u00e1\u00ed\u00e1s-ud-d\u00edn Balban sent as governor to Koil to quell a rebellion of the Native Rajas. He was son-in-law of the great Altamsh (Ilkitmish), and was powerful enough to succeed his brother-in-law, the Sultan N\u00e1sir-ud-d\u00edn, on his death in 1265. To him we owe the great mindar that until lately stood in Koil, and an inscription on it, bearing date in the eighth year of the reign of N\u00e1sir-ud-d\u00edn, runs as follows:\n\n\"This building was built during the reign of the great Sult\u00e1n, the owner of the neck of nations, N\u00e1sir-ud-dunya w\u00e1-ad-d\u00edn, king of kings, the protector of the people of the faith, the heir of the kingdom of Sulaim\u00e1n, the lord of the seal in the kingdom of the world, Abul Muzaffar Mahmud, son of the king. May God perpetuate his kingdom and his rule! By order of the learned great Malik Azam Kutlugh Kh\u00e1n, Bah\u00e1-ud-hak w\u00e1-ad-d\u00edn, the Malik of the Maliks of the east and of China, Balban, the Sham\u00ed, during the days of his governorship\u2014May his high office continue\u2014on the 10th Raj\u00e1b A.A. 651 (17th August, 1253 A.D.)\"\n\nThe pillar was pulled down in 1862. Balban seems to have been relieved of his government by Malik Sher Kh\u00e1n, who, in 1259 A.D., received the districts of Bay\u00e1na, Koil, B\u00e1l\u00e1r\u00e1m, and Gwalior. He was nephew of the great Ulugh Kh\u00e1n, and owed his appointment to the good offices of his uncle. On his accession to the throne, Balban gave the fief of Koil to Muhammad Sherand\u00e1z, who, with his brother Malik Mukaddir, took part in the Bengal campaign against the rebel Tughril. Under Firuz Shah, Kiki Malik was governor of Koil (1291 A.D.) During the reign of Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn, in 1300 A.D., the Mughals under Targhi\n\n---\n\n1 The inscription is in the Toghra character, and I am indebted for the translation to Mr. Blochmann of Calcutta, from a rubbing procured at Koil. Mr. Thomas gives a facsimile of the inscription in his 'Pathan Kings of Delhi,' p. 199, Lond., 1871. He also gives a faulty reading, but no translation. Mr. Blochmann notes that \"Thomas imagines that the inscription was traced by N\u00e1sir himself, but of this there is no proof, and in page 130 he mistakes 'Malik-ul-Akia' ('the learned malik') for 'Malik-ul-Alam' ('king of the world'). Balban, whose real name was Bah\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn, is here called Sham\u00ed, which means related to Shams-ud-d\u00edn Altamsh. His title, Kutlugh Kh\u00e1n, (not Kutlagh Kh\u00e1n), is Turkish, (1), the word 'Kutlugh' meaning 'a standard-bearer' in Turki.\"\n\n2 Tarikh-i-Firuz Shahi, Elliot, III, 117, 190, 538.\ninvaded Hindust\u00e1n and encamped on the banks of the Jumna between Dehli and the imperial forces, which were shut up in Baran and Koil, and were unable to advance towards Dehli. Ibn Batuta gives us a glimpse of the state of Koil in the reign of Muhammad b\u00eda Tughlik. He mentions the town in his account of his embassy from Dehli to China (1342 A.D.) From him\u00b9 it would appear that the district was then in a very disturbed state, since the escort of the Emperor's embassy had to assist in relieving Jal\u00e1li from an attacking body of Hind\u00fas, and lost one of their officers in the fight. Ibn Batuta calls Koil \"a fine town surrounded by mango groves.\" From these same groves the environs of Koil would appear to have acquired the name of Sabzabad, or 'the green country.' In 1376-77, during the reign of Firuz Shah Tughlik, the fiefs of Oudh and Sandila (Shadida) and the Shikk of Koil were placed under Malik His\u00e1m-ul-Mulk and His\u00e1m-ud-d\u00edn Naw\u00e1. \"These nobles showed such zeal in establishing order in their respective commands that the Sult\u00e1n had no anxiety about the safety of these parts of his dominions.\" The next great event of local importance was the invasion of Timur, detachments of whose cavalry are said to have swept through the north of the district. On his departure this portion of the Dn\u00e1b fell into the hands of Ikb\u00e1l Kh\u00e1n, who made several expeditions against the refractory Hind\u00fa tribes throughout the Dn\u00e1b. In one of these petty raids Ikb\u00e1l Kh\u00e1n was joined by Sult\u00e1n Mahm\u00fad, who had taken refuge in Dh\u00e1r during the late troubles. Ikb\u00e1l Kh\u00e1n took the Sult\u00e1n with him to Kanauj and left him there, whilst he himself proceeded towards Jaunpur. From 1400 until his death in 1405 A.D. Ikb\u00e1l Kh\u00e1n was master of Upper India, whilst Sult\u00e1n Mahm\u00fad resided, with the mere semblance of power, at Kanauj. The nominal king was little better off by the death of his keeper, for when, towards the end of 1405 he went to Dehli and sent the family of Ikb\u00e1l Kh\u00e1n to the khitta of Koil, Daulat Kh\u00e1n was made Faujd\u00e1r of the Dn\u00e1b, and Koil became the scene of many a battle between the Jaunpur and Dehli forces.\n\nOne result of this absence of control was that the successors of Mahm\u00fad found the whole of the Dn\u00e1b in utter confusion. The imperial authority was only recognized in Koil as long as the army remained, and in 1419 A.D. Khizr Kh\u00e1n, the first of the Sayyid Sult\u00e1ns, found it necessary to march against Koil in person. In the following year T\u00e1j-ul-Mulk was sent again to chastise the rebels in the neighbourhood of Koil. In 1426 A.D. the imperial forces encamped at Atrauli for a season, under Sult\u00e1n Mub\u00e1rik Sh\u00e1h II., in order to oppose the advance of the Jaunpur forces under Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Sh\u00e1h Sharki, and pursued the latter prince through the Et\u00e1wa district and across the Jumna. In 1445 A.D. Isa Kh\u00e1n Tarkbacha held Koil along with Jal\u00e1li, and was confirmed in his office by Sult\u00e1n Bahlol Lodi on the defeat of Sult\u00e1n Husain of Jaunpur, who had hitherto retained possession of the Dn\u00e1b as far as Jalesar and Jal\u00e1li.\n\n\u00b9 Cathay and the way thither, II., 412.\nDuring the reign of Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Lodi, the zam\u00ednd\u00e1rs of Jartoli, a place dependent on Koil, were chastised by the governor of Sambhal, and the district was completely brought under subjection by Bahlo\u00ee Lodi in 1478. We next hear of Koil in connection with the Mughals. After the capture of Delhi B\u00e1bar appointed his dependant Kaohak Ali governor of Koil (1526 A.D.), but as soon as the reverses of the Mughals threatened the stability of their government, Kaohak Ali was attacked by a body of Du\u00e1b bowmen under one Ily\u00e1s Kh\u00e1n and was taken prisoner. The success of the insurgents was very short-lived, for in the following year Ily\u00e1s Kh\u00e1n was taken prisoner and was slain alive.\n\nAn inscription in the fort of Koil records its construction during the reign of Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Lodi by the Shikk\u00e1d\u00e1r Muhammad, son of Ummer, in 1524-25 A.D. The text runs as follows:\n\n\"In the name of God, the Merciful and the Clement!\n1. At first I said:\u2014'Praise be to God, who has created Mustafa.'\n2. I then wrote several verses on account of the fort. I shall not remain, a monument (of me) shall remain.\n3. A strong fort, a firm foundation, completed in the reign of my king,\n4.

He has suffered much hardship on account of the building, and raised the structure, in a short time.\n7. It was in 931 H. when the fort was completed.\n8. May I, a helpless man, whose name is Ahmad, find on the day of resurrection the shadow of Ahmad (the prophet).\"\n\nIn the reign of Akbar, Koil was made a Sirk\u00e1r, and included the dast\u00fars of M\u00e1rahra, Kol ba Haveli, Th\u00e1n\u00e9 Far\u00edda, and Akbarabad. The greater portion of dast\u00far Th\u00e1n\u00e9 Far\u00edda is now in the Meerut district, and of dast\u00far M\u00e1rahra is now in Eta. The names and revenue of the parganahs forming this district are given elsewhere. In the beginning of Shahjah\u00e1n's reign Nij\u00e1bat Kh\u00e1n was faujd\u00e1r of the district, and in 662 A.D. Hasan Ali Kh\u00e1n, tuyuld\u00e1r, was sent to suppress a local rebellion by Aurangzeb. An inscription on the Idgah in Koil dates from the reign of Akbar and runs as follows:\n\n\"In the name of God, the Clement and the Merciful!\n\nIn the reign of the victorious ruler, in the time of the faith cherishing Shah Jal\u00e1-ad-d\u00edn Muhammad Sh\u00e1h, over all Sh\u00e1hs greatest (Akbar), Muhammad Gesu, the benevolent, erected this building as fruit of life (devoted) to the prophet, and as a radiant eye to Ali. This building was well erected in the month of Ramazan, in the year of the Hijra 900 and 70 over (i.e., 970, or June, 1668 A.D.).\"\n\nMuhammad Gesu was clearly a Shiah, and may be the same as the M\u00edr Muhammad Gesu, a servant of Akbar's faujd\u00e1r of Meerut in 1582 A.D., and eventually murdered there. The next inscription is one on the dargah of Sh\u00e1h Il\u00e1hbaksh, bearing date in the reign of Farrukhsiy\u00e1r:\u2014\nThis tomb was built for the rest and peace of Shah Ilahbakhsh (the saint), acquainted with hidden truths and revelations, by the slave, the servant of the fakir, S\u00e1bit Kh\u00e1n, alias Jafar Beg, son of Muhammed Beg, in the year 1129 H. (1717 A.D.), the sixth year of the reign of Muhammed Farrukhsiyar, Padishah-i-Gh\u00e1z\u00ed, with the assistance of Bhau Singh, the architect.\n\nThe mention of S\u00e1bit Kh\u00e1n brings us to the best known and best remembered of all the governors of Koil in modern times. S\u00e1bit Kh\u00e1n repaired the old Lodi fort and called it, after his own name, S\u00e1bitgarh, and the great mosque in the centre of the town, also built by him, bears the following inscription:\n\n\"The praise belongs to God; let us praise him without ceasing: and the thanks belong to God; let us thank him without end, that with sums for benevolent purposes, for the sake of Muhammad, may God bless him. The servant of the throne of him with whom all creatures take refuge, S\u00e1bit Kh\u00e1n Bah\u00e1dur, S\u00e1bit Jang, son of Muhammed Beg, a Turkman Mughal, living in Koil, built the Jam\u00e1 Masjid and the well; commenced in 1137 H. and finished in 1141 H., or the eleventh year of Muhammed Shah, Padishah-i-Gh\u00e1z\u00ed (A.D. 1732.) Who can sufficiently perform the duty of thanking God.\"\n\nHe was a pious, careful ruler, and induced many of the Hind\u00fas to become Musalm\u00e1ns. One important branch of the Badg\u00edjars of Bulandshahr was converted by his influence, and to this day bears the name 'S\u00e1bit Kh\u00e1n\u00ed.' The descendants of S\u00e1bit Kh\u00e1n reside to the present day in Koil, and assume the name of Naw\u00e1b as a title of honour, though most of them are common labourers. Soon after the death of this governor the district fell into the state of confusion common to the whole empire, and which has been slightly sketched in the introduction to the present volume. The Marhattas commenced their incursions, and the J\u00e1tas soon followed. These latter were invited by Safdar Jang to assist him in his campaign against the Afgh\u00e1ns of Farukhabad, and having once obtained a footing in the Du\u00e1b, knew well how to increase the advantages of their position. About the year 1757, Surajmal, the J\u00e1t leader, took the fort of S\u00e1bitgarh, and changed the name to R\u00e1mgarh, still the name of a village close to the fort. The J\u00e1tas soon became masters of the entire country, and no doubt their new capital must have materially aided them in their conquests. The fort lies about two miles to the north of the city of Koil, and must always have been a place of strength and importance. The roads leading from Muttra and Agra towards Dehli and Rohilkhand all centre here.\n\nThe J\u00e1tas, however, did not remain long in possession for, in 1759, the Afgh\u00e1ns, under Ahmad Sh\u00e1h Abd\u00e1l\u00ed, expelled them from Koil, which was made a portion of the Afgh\u00e1n head-quarters, and appears to have been the encampment of the Rohilla detachments also. As soon as the Daur\u00e1ni retired\n\n---\n\n1 For this translation also I am indebted to Mr. Blochmann.

He was opposed by Najib-ud-daula between Tappal and Jawar on the banks of the Jumna. The Rohilla had intrenched himself in a strong position, and S\u00farajmal erected batteries to make the attack at leisure, whilst with his horse he intercepted his adversary's supplies. One day, whilst in a battery, a sally was made by the royal troops, and S\u00farajmal was shot, and his troops retired to Bharatpur. Six months later Jaw\u00e1hir Singh, the son and successor of S\u00farajmal, re-entered the Du\u00e1b accompanied by a large Marhatta force (1765 A.D.), but retired the following year. Aligarh was frequently, for a time, in the possession of the J\u00e1tas until 1773 A.D., when Naw\u00e1l Singh, the J\u00e1t leader, was completely defeated by Naj\u00ed Kh\u00e1n, who followed up his successes so well that in 1776 A.D. Dig alone remained to them, and Naj\u00ed Kh\u00e1n himself undertook the government of the Du\u00e1b. He repaired the fort of R\u00e1mgarh and changed its name to Aligarh.\n\nNaj\u00ed Kh\u00e1n died in 1782 without issue, and there was at once a contest for his offices. Afrasy\u00e1b Kh\u00e1n succeeded him as am\u00edr-ul-umara, but he met with powerful rivals in Shafi Kh\u00e1n, who commanded in the Panjab, and Muhammad Beg Hamad\u00e1n\u00ed, who held Agra. The latter did all he could to plunder and lay waste the country towards Koil, now held by Afrasy\u00e1b Kh\u00e1n. All these subsequently united their forces, and Afrasy\u00e1b Kh\u00e1n was left in possession of the Du\u00e1b and the tracts to the south-west of the Jumna jointly with Muhammad Beg. In 1784 Afrasy\u00e1b Kh\u00e1n was assassinated with the connivance of Madhoji Sindhia, who became am\u00edr-ul-umara. All the accumulations of Afrasy\u00e1b were at this time in Aligarh, which was held by his brother Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr Kh\u00e1n.\n\n\"He had a strong garrison, and the siege was expected to be long and bloody. Early in the month of July of the current year Sindhia appeared before the place. Contrary, however, to all expectations, it held out but a short time. It has been imagined that the fears of the women for the preservation of their honour and effects had inclined the commandant of the fort to pacific measures. Certain it is that Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr Khan, signifying his readiness to negotiate, a treaty was accordingly drawn up and agreed to by the respective parties. To Kh\u00e1dim Husain, eldest son of the deceased Naw\u00e1b, a j\u00e1g\u00e9r was allotted amounting to a yearly revenue of a lakh and a half of rupees. To the Begams were promised an honourable asylum, and to Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr Khan personal safety. It appears, however, that this treaty was very ill adhered to by the Marhatta Chief; for, on the place being surrendered, the Begams and Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr Kh\u00e1n were sent under a strong guard to the fort of Gwalior and there detained in confinement. The young Naw\u00e1b, indeed, was received by Sindhia with great\n\n---\n\n1 Life of H\u00e1d\u00edz Rahmat Kh\u00e1n, 84.

He died in 1827, and was succeeded by his son Ghul\u00e1m Husain Kh\u00e1n, who received a pension of Rs. 130 per mensum from Lord Auckland. He had nearly persuaded Lord Ellenborough to restore the taluka to him revenue-free, when it was found that his sanad had been tampered with in order to introduce the words \u2018naslan bad naslan,\u2019 signifying a grant in perpetuity. The consequence was that he lost the pension as well as the estate.\n\nAligarh remained in possession of the Marhattas until 1788, when Ghul\u00e1m K\u00e1dir Kh\u00e1n, abandoning his associate Isma\u00edl Beg at Agra, made a rapid march on Aligarh and took the fortress by storm. He obtained a considerable booty, and leaving a Rohilla garrison behind him proceeded to Dehli. Sindhia recovered Aligarh the same year, and it remained in the hands of the Marhattas until 1803. Aligarh, under the Marhattas, is chiefly remarkable as the place where Sindhia, with the aid of De Boigne, organised those regular battalions drilled and armed after the European fashion, which subsequently did such good service on many a hard-fought field. It was here that De Boigne completed the arrangements of his corps, and received nearly the whole of the Meerut Division in jaeddd for their support. Two battalions were raised in 1784 and placed under the control of Apa Khandi Rao, and did such good service at Chak\u00e1na and Agra in 1785 and 1786, and at L\u00e1lson in 1788, that on his restoration to power Sindhia ordered De Boigne to raise fourteen more battalions in 1789, and form them into two brigades, with one hundred pieces of cannon. This was completed in 1790, and shortly after their formation they were drawn into action in the famous battle of Mairta in 1790, where they defeated the Rathors, and again the combined forces of the Jaipur Raja and Isma\u00edl Beg. In the quarrel between Holkar and Sindhia regarding the division of the spoil of Hindustan, De Boigne\u2019s battalions won for Sindhia the battle of Lakha\u00edri, though opposed to Dudrene\u00e9\u2019s battalions fighting on behalf of Holkar. They also won the battle of Kanond against the forces of Isma\u00edl Beg and the widow of Najf K\u00fali Kh\u00e1n. In fact all the Marhatta successes from the Chambal to the Him\u00e1layas since 1784 A.D. were due to these troops alone.\\(^3\\) In 1796 De Boigne was succeeded by Perron. At this time there were three brigades: one commanded by Major Perron at Poona, one under Major Sutherland at Muttra, and one under Captain Pedron at Aligarh.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Franklin\u2019s Shah Aulum 136: London, 1798.\n\n\\(^2\\) L. F. Smith\u2019s Regulus Corps in the service of Native States: Calcutta, 1804.\nPerron came to Aligarh in 1797 and assumed the supreme command. He at once arranged and pursued a systematic plan to aggrandise his authority and riches. From Lahore to Kota and from Aligarh to Jodhpur the country obeyed his authority and dreaded his frown: his only rivals, Tantia Pagnavis and Lakhwa Dada, perished in 1801, and in the following year George Thomas fell. Another brigade was added in 1802, which increased the disciplined forces to four brigades, or thirty-two battalions. A storm, however, broke out at Ujjain, and Perron, at the risk of his life and place, was obliged to proceed to court and appease his enemies, which having accomplished by the liberal use of money, he returned in safety to Aligarh. At this time (November, 1802) the Peshwa demanded assistance from Sindhia against Holkar, and Sindhia ordered Perron to send him some of his brigades but Perron hesitated, and so long, that when he did despatch them they arrived too late, and the Peshwa had already joined the British. The result of this step was the triple alliance between Holkar, Sindhia, and the Raja of Nagpur against the British, the Nizam, and the Peshwa. Perron drew up the plan of the campaign and advised Sindhia to attack the Nizam's country whilst he held the northern Duab, and Holkar attacked Surat and Ambaji Inglia, and Shamsher Bahadur from Bundelkhand ravaged the lower Duab, then held by the British.\n\nBy the treaty of 1802 the British frontier had been advanced to within fifteen miles of Koil. \"Such was the weakness of the former administration that the zamindars tyrannized over the people with impunity, levying imposts at their pleasure, and applying the revenues solely to their own use. These petty despots, whose treachery could only be exceeded by their rapacity, were, at the time of the cession, becoming every day more dangerous to the neighbouring states, in erecting fortresses and training soldiers on their domains, thereby opposing the legitimate authority, opening new sources of contention, and forming numerous banditti, who acknowledged no law but the commands of their respective chiefs. To such a degree of power and confidence had these refractory zamindars arrived through the debility of the Government of Oudh, that even some trouble was experienced in reducing their strongholds, after the change had taken place by the transfer of the country to the British authority. This was particularly instanced at Ssani and Bijeigarh (then in Parganah Jalali), two forts belonging to Raja Bhagwant Singh of Mursan, which, though attacked by the Commander-in-Chief in person, were not carried without the loss of many lives. It was the introduction of our system of customs and transit duties which prompted the Raja and other zamindars to rebel. Hitherto in every large village they had their toll-house, at which they levied arbitrary duties on goods passing through their estates, and they resisted by force of arms the transfer to the British Government of a source of revenue which they greatly valued.\nas adding to their power and dignity no less than to their wealth. Raja Bhagwant Singh was expelled from his forts in March, 1803, and his possessions in Parganah Jaliali were confiscated.\" Petty expeditions against the neighbouring chiefs were of daily occurrence, and all prepared for the grand struggle which they knew must sooner or later come. The Marhatta chiefs formally adopted Perron's plan of campaign, but with little intention of adhering to its spirit, should that be opposed to what they considered their own interests.\n\nThe first result of this condition of affairs was a declaration of war in 1803.\n\nCapture of Allgarh. On the 29th August the British force under Lord Lake advanced towards the frontier and were met by Perron with about 8,000 good horse, but nothing was done, and the cavalry dispersed at the first round of grape from the British horse artillery. Perron himself fled to Hathras, and thence to Muttra. On the 5th September he wrote to General Lake from Muttra and proposed to surrender himself on assurance of protection to his person and property. This was readily granted, and Perron having sent for his family from Agra, contrived to elude the vigilance of his troops by giving them liberal largesses, and joined the British force at Sassi. In the meantime every preparation was made for the assault of the fort then commanded by Colonel Pedron and garrisoned by about two thousand men. The 4th of September was fixed for the assault, and Colonel Monson was appointed to lead the attack with four companies of Her Majesty's 76th Regiment under Major McLeod, two battalions of the 4th Native Infantry under Colonel Browne, and four companies of the 17th Native Infantry under Captain Bagshaw. During the night immediately preceding the attack, two covering batteries of four 18-pounders each were erected,\u2014one at a village near the fort, and the other near Perron's house, to protect the storming party.\n\n\"About 3 a.m. the whole of the attacking party left the camp, marching in a circular direction towards the gateway, which was the only entrance into the fort across the ditch, on their arrival within four hundred yards of which they halted till daybreak. While thus waiting in breathless expectation, an officer who had been reconnoitring reported his having seen about sixty or seventy of the enemy seated round a fire and smoking under a tree in front of the gateway. On receiving this intelligence, a small party from Her Majesty's 76th Regiment was sent with the view of taking these men by surprise, and to endeavour, amidst the confusion, to enter the fort with them, when the gate might be secured till the arrival of the main body. This design, however, unluckily failed through the ardour of those employed; but though the surprised party gave an alarm on discovering our soldiers, not one of them escaped to relate the particulars, so that the assailants had an opportunity of retiring as quietly as they came; and the sentries on the ramparts, while they opened\na brisk fire in that direction, took the affair for nothing more than a near approach of our videttes. On the firing of the morning gun, which was the appointed signal for the assault, the storming party, covered by a heavy fire from the two batteries already mentioned, moved on till they came within one hundred yards of the gate, in front of which was a traverse, recently thrown up, and mounted with three 6-pounders, from which, however, the enemy were dislodged before they had time to discharge them. Colonel Monson then pushed forward with the two flank companies of the 76th Regiment, and attempted to enter the fort along with the guard stationed behind this breast-work; but on reaching the place it was found abandoned and the first gate shut, while the entrance or sortie was raked by two or three guns, and flanked by the bastions, particularly the lower one of the rampy opposite to it, and which kept up a most destructive fire of grape shot. Two ladders were then instantly applied to the walls, and Major McLeod, of the 76th, with the grenadiers, attempted to mount, but being opposed by a formidable row of pikemen, threatening death to all assailants, they were obliged to desist. A 6-pounder was then planted before the gate to force it open, but without effect; on which a 12-pounder was brought up, though some time elapsed before it could be properly placed, on account of the peculiar situation of the gate, which was near the flank of a bastion. Four or five rounds were fired before any impression was made upon the gate; and during the whole of the interval, which lasted full twenty minutes, the storming party was exposed to a most severe and raking fire, not only of musketry but grape, from the great guns and wall-pieces. The scaling ladders placed against the walls were crowded with the enemy, who left the ramparts and came down by them to contend with us while engaged in the effort to force an entrance. This was the arduous crisis; and here we sustained our principal loss. Colonel Monson was wounded by a pike on this spot; and here four grenadier officers were killed, together with the adjutant of the 76th Regiment and Lieutenant Turton of the 4th Native Infantry. Dreadful, however, as the struggle was, with death flying and grappling in every direction, nothing could appal the determined spirit of the British troops, who by their perseverance amidst these fearful odds and perilous circumstances succeeded in overcoming all obstacles. As soon as the first gate was thrown open, the whole party advanced in a circular direction along a narrow road, defended by a strong round tower built of masonry. This tower was pierced with loop-holes from which a constant and most deadly fire was kept up by a number of matchlock-men, while showers of grape poured from the neighbouring bastion and the narrow passage. After forcing the second gate, which was easily accomplished, the troops proceeded along a narrow causeway to another gate, of which they gained possession by taking advantage of the confused state of the enemy, who, in crowding to get through, gave our\nparty an opportunity of passing, before it could be shut against them. During this time the troops were severely annoyed by a heavy cross fire in every direction, but nothing could repress their ardour in the pursuit, which was continued till they arrived at a fourth gate leading into the body of the place.\"\n\n\"Here new delay and mortification occurred, for Captain Shipton, of the artillery, who had charge of the guns, and who, though wounded, still remained actively at his post, experienced some difficulty in bringing up the 12-pounder; and when it actually came, the gate was found too strongly secured to be forced. Major McLeod, however, having succeeded in passing through the wicket and ascending the ramparts, resistance gradually lessened, till this fortress, hitherto considered impregnable, fell, a hard-earned conquest to the intrepid band of assailants, after a most vigorous defence which lasted nearly an hour. Though our loss was necessarily considerable, it was far exceeded by that of the enemy, who had at least two thousand killed, the surrounding ditch being almost filled with dead bodies, owing to the attempts made by many of the garrison to effect their escape that way after the entrance of our troops into the interior of the fort. Many who could swim were enabled to gain the plain on the outside, but numbers were drowned; and even the former, through their obstinacy in refusing to surrender, were cut up by a picquet of the 27th Dragoons. They who yielded were permitted to quit the fort and be at large by the Commander-in-Chief, who was close to the place all the time, observing with the utmost anxiety the result of his energetic and ably arranged plan of attack. The fort being carried, M. Pedron, who had commanded it, was conducted as a prisoner to General Lake. He was an elderly man, clad in a green jacket, with gold lace and epaulettes; the second in command, a Marhatta chief, was killed; and two other chiefs were taken prisoners. It should here be observed that the achievement was materially facilitated by the loyal and gallant conduct of Mr. Luncan, a British officer, who had lately quitted the service of Sindhia to avoid fighting against his countrymen. On joining our army he undertook to lead Colonel Monson to the gate and point out the road through the fort, which he effected in such a manner as to gain the particular thanks of the Commander-in-Chief and the public acknowledgments of the Government.\" The British lost in the attack 26 Europeans and 21 natives killed, and 76 Europeans and 105 natives wounded. Guns of various descriptions to the number of 281 were captured in the fort, besides large supplies of powder and shot, accoutrements, and some tumbrils containing Spanish dollars.\n\n---\n\n1 Thorn Mem., War in India, 447.  \n2 Major Smith gives the names of the officers killed, viz., Cameron, Browne, Fleming, Campbell, and St. Aubin of the 76th Regiment, and Turton of the 4th Native Infantry. The officers of the 76th were interred in front of their standard guard, in presence of General Lake and his staff. Eleven officers were wounded. It was not until 1851 that a medal was given for the storming of Aligarh (see further under Aligarh in the alphabetical notices).\nFrom the importance attached to Aligarh by M. Perron, and his retaining it as his place of residence, it may be naturally supposed that nothing was omitted which the skill and experience of French engineers could devise, for the purpose of adding to its natural strength. The elevated plain in the midst of which it stands, being interspersed with large swamps and deep morasses, becomes so completely inundated during the rainy months as to render the fort perfectly inaccessible, nor can any military operations be then carried on against it. The ditch is from one to two hundred feet in breadth, and thirty-two in depth, of which there are always ten feet of water. The several bastions and faussebrayes lined with guns, bearing upon the only entrance into the fort, are, from their peculiar situation, extremely formidable; and had the garrison cut the narrow passage in front of the gate, so as to unite the two ditches, it would have been impossible to have carried the place by assault. They had, indeed, the day before the attack commenced, a mine on the outside of the gate, under the traverse recently erected, and, no doubt, the junction of the ditches would soon have followed, if we had allowed time for it, by adopting the slow operations of a siege, or deferred the attack a few days longer. This neglect of an obvious advantage on the part of the enemy could not escape observation, and therefore our first care after the capture was to render the fort completely insular, by uniting the ditches, substituting a drawbridge for the causeway, and thus making the place impregnable, at least to a native army.\n\nThe formation of the district and its fiscal history is told elsewhere, and here I will merely give the general history of the pacification of the district. Scarcely had the district been formed, when the war with Holkar broke out, and his emissaries poured into the Du\u00e1b, exciting the hopes and fears of all those who had managed to assume some semblance of right over the collection of villages known as talukas. These talukas were undoubtedly due to the disorders of the previous half century, when revenue had to be collected by some means, and there was no regular assessment. Amils were appointed as farmers who were obliged to pay a certain sum within a fixed time into the treasury, and in order to meet their engagements they sublet their farms to others who had full power to collect all that they could lay hold on. Some energetic individuals engaged for a cluster of bad villages, and by force or persuasion managed the cultivators, provided for the cultivation, and paid the revenue as it became due. No inquiry was ever made into proprietary rights; success in collecting the revenue was the sole standard of fitness, and the amil supported the title, though the persons engaging for the revenue never possessed an acre of land in the tracts for which they engaged. Gradually the most unscrupulous and most energetic survived and assumed the title of talukad\u00e1rs, and, owing to their local knowledge and experience, could not be passed over by the successive Imperial, J\u00e1t and Marhatta governors of the district. In this manner the Badg\u00fajar,\nJat, Rajput, and Musalm\u00e1n talukas arose and increased, and flourished more and more with anarchy and disorder. Sindhia himself with all his power failed, in many cases, to recover the just demands of the State from those to whom lands had been granted in jagir for services rendered to the contending factions, who were almost year by year compelled in this way to purchase the support of the military communities. Even De Boigne and Perron thought themselves fortunate if they could collect a nominal revenue from the more powerful talukadars and grantees. Perron's administration was undoubtedly a strong one. His subjects enjoyed peace from the hands of maraudors, who used occasionally to visit the towns for plunder; but still there was no real safety for person or property. Cash and valuables were buried, no money-lending could be carried on, trade was crushed by vexatious imposts, there was no export of grain and cultivation languished, no one wore good clothes in order to avoid contributions, mud houses, for the same reason, were alone built, and altogether insecurity and 'the right of might' showed their natural results in the total disorganisation of society. Such was the state of things at the British occupation, and our early rulers at once set themselves to the task of reducing chaos to order. Inquiries were made into the rights of the talukadars, the levying of transit dues was prohibited, and those whose own will had hitherto been their sole law began to feel that a really strong power had, at last, sprung up and would make itself respected.\n\nHolkar's emissaries had, therefore, good material to work upon in 1804. Amongst the first to join the Marhattas were Nahar Ali Khan and Dundi Khan, converted Badgujars\u00b9 of Pitampur, now in the Bulandshahr district, who held the whole of the northern and north-eastern parganas. Holkar's amils held the country to the west and north-west, whilst Abhai Singh, a leader of banditti, occupied Chandaus, and in Koil itself an insurrection broke out in September which lasted for nine days. Mr. Claude Russell joined his appointment as Magistrate and Collector in December, 1804, and with the assistance of the talukadar of Beswan expelled the Marhattas from Noh Jhil and Khair.\u00b2 Colonel Grueber expelled Abhai Singh from Chandaus, and Captain Cruttenden recovered Parganahs Atrauli and Dibai. When Colonel Grueber retired, Atrauli and Dibai were again occupied by the Badgujars and Chandaus was menaced. The commandant at Aligarh could not spare sufficient troops for the Collector's support, and at length Colonel Richardson was sent against the Badgujars, and their rebellion was put an end to by the capture of Turkipura in July, 1805. Dundi Khan was pardoned and his estates were given to his son Ranmast Khan, who at once set about repairing the losses suffered during the recent campaign, and, unchecked and unwarned, restored his numerous forts to order. The estates of Nahar Ali Khan also were confiscated, but on his death, a\n\n\u00b9 The history of this family is given in full under the Bulandshahr district. \u00b2 Board's Records, 18th February, 1805, No. 19.\nshort time afterwards, they were restored to his son. In February, 1805 the Amir Khan, with his Pindaris, crossed the Jumna at Mahaban and marched upwards celebrated through the Duab to Kamona, the fort of Dundi Khan. Colonel Grueber with two battalions and two companies of regular troops and 1,500 of Skinner's horse was at that time investing Kamona, and retired on the approach of the Pindaris, but Amir Khan stayed only one day, and passed northwards to the Meerut district closely pursued by General Smith. A fortnight after, on their way back, the Pindaris defeated a body of the Hathras Raja's troops at the fords of the Jumna, but made no further disturbance in this district. Notwithstanding the lenity with which he had been treated, or perhaps in consequence of that mistaken lenity, Ranmast Khan soon showed fresh signs of disaffection and refused to engage for his share of Pitampur and the farm of Shikarpur on any reasonable terms. He was expelled in 1806. In October, 1806, the Magistrate (Mr. Cunningham) reported to Government that Dundi Khan had marched with an armed force against the zamindars of Masmana in Noh Jhil, had expelled them, and fired a salute of eleven guns. In August, 1807, the Magistrate (Mr. Speeding) reported that Dundi Khan and Ranmast Khan were prepared to resist any force sent against them, and that they had mounted cannon on their forts of Kamona and Gannaura. In the following month the Collector (Mr. Russell) reported Ranmast Khan's general and systematic disregard of authority, his uniform disaffection to the Government, and his positive violation of the conditions of his pardon, and in consequence of these reports the Governor-General, on the 25th September, ordered a military force against Dundi Khan, to apprehend him and reduce his forts, unless he should pay his revenue, dismantle his forts, and surrender his person. But the troops were directed not to commence operations till the legal forms required by Regulation III. of 1804 had been fulfilled. Accordingly the Magistrate summoned Dundi Khan and Ranmast Khan to attend, but instead of answering the summons they commenced laying in provisions and making preparations for defence, and Ranmast Khan increased the list of his offences by plundering the town of Shikarpur. On the 12th of October Major-General Dickens invested the fort of Kamona; on the 19th November a breach was effected, and an attempt made to carry the place by storm, but the assailants were driven back with great slaughter, the loss of men and officers exceeding that sustained in many of the pitched battles of the time. The impression however made on the garrison was such that Dundi Khan evacuated the fort on the 24th and threw himself into Gannaura, from which place he made his escape on the 13th of December. A reward of Rs. 10,000 was offered for his apprehension, and Rs. 5,000 for the arrest of\n\n---\n\n1 Board's Records, 3rd July, 1807, No. 12; 25th September, 1807, No. 15. 2 Ibid, 29th September, 1807, No. 1. 3 Ibid, 31st October, 1807, No. 72.\nALIGARH DISTRICT.\n\neach of his sons. His ancestral estate of half Pitampur was given by Government to Mard\u00e1n Ali Kh\u00e1n, who, though a near relation of D\u00fandi Kh\u00e1n, was a zealous partisan of our Government during D\u00fandi Kh\u00e1n's rebellion. It is now known as Chat\u00e1ri. (See Bulandshahr District).\n\nAfter this the peace of the district was not disturbed for several years until the rebellion of Daya R\u00e1m of H\u00e1thras and Bhagwant Singh of Murs\u00e1n rendered military operations on a somewhat extensive scale necessary. An account of the subjugation of these talukad\u00e1s has already been given (pages), 430,436 and from this time until the mutiny of 1857 there is little worth recording beyond what has been given in the fiscal history of the district.\n\nNews of the outbreak at Meerut arrived at Aligarh on the 12th May, 1857. Messrs. Watson, Lane, and F. B. Outram represented the civil administration of the district, and the military garrison comprised 300 men of the 9th Native Infantry under Major Eld. A period of the usual uncertainty and dismay ensued, but the troops appeared quiet and orderly, and beyond the burning of an empty bungalow no overt act of disaffection occurred until the 20th of May. On the 19th the infantry were reinforced by a detachment, and on the 20th the right wing of the 1st Gwalior Cavalry marched in under Captain Alexander. On the same day a Brahman named Nar\u00e1yan, a resident of a village close to Aligarh, was found tampering with the sepoys and was sentenced to death the same evening. The execution had hardly terminated when the 9th broke out into open mutiny. The officers, civilians and ladies escaped to H\u00e1thras, and the station was occupied by rebel troops and the rabble from Koil and the neighbouring villages. The Courts were plundered and burned, and seven lakhs of rupees in specie were divided amongst the insurgents. The prisoners were released from the jail, and the large bullock train at the post-office was plundered chiefly through Ras\u00fal Kh\u00e1n, kh\u00e1sd\u00fam\u00e1h of the d\u00e1k bungalow, and Mr Kh\u00e1n, mail-guard. Messrs. Conner, Cline, and Nichterlein, who had been left behind on the 20th, made their way to Saw\u00e1m\u00e1i, close to S\u00e1sni, on the 22nd, where they were attacked and plundered by the Mewatis, and Mr. Nichterlein, junior, was killed. The party was, however, released the same night by Panna L\u00e1l, a resident of S\u00e1sni, and was conducted in safety to H\u00e1thras. On the 24th 100 men of the Gwalior Cavalry mutinied and left for Dehli, and the Europeans retreated to Khandan\u00ed in the Agra district. On the 29th the planters of the Muloi factory were released by the Agra volunteers, who remained with Mr. Watson until the arrival of the Nimach rebels, and the mutiny of the remainder of the Gwalior Cavalry obliged that officer to retire to Agra (July 2nd).\n\nThe following account is taken from Mr. W. J. Bramly's official narrative and the other mutiny memoirs.\nMr. Watson communicated with the Meerut and Bulandshahr authorities throughout, but they were unable to afford him any assistance.\n\nThe volunteers comprised forty men commanded by Lieutenant W. H. Greathead. On the 28th May they advanced to Aligarh and occupied the station. Whilst at Aligarh intelligence was received from Khair that Rao Bhupal Singh, Chauhan, had deposed the tahsildar and proclaimed a Rajput government. Mr. Watson and Dr. S. Clarke, with the volunteers, made a night march to Khair, about fourteen miles west of Aligarh, and whilst the town was surrounded by videttes to prevent the rebel chief's escape, Mr. Watson, with a few volunteers, gallantly rode straight through the town to the tahsili, where Bhupal Singh was surprised and captured with sixteen followers. Rao Bhupal Singh was hanged on the spot, and the party returned to Aligarh. Mr. Paterson Saunders then took command of the volunteers. About the middle of the month the Chauhans joined by the Jats, re-occupied Khair and plundered and destroyed nearly all the Government buildings, as well as the houses of the Baniyas and Mahajans. Until about the middle of June the volunteer force remained intact. Mr. Cocks writes: \"It was sufficiently strong to overawe the Muhammadan population of the town of Koil, as well as the refractory villages, which were ever ready to take advantage of the state of anarchy. On several occasions we were obliged to saddle at a moment's warning and descend on these villagers, who met us with matchlocks, swords, and bludgeons, but were on every occasion well punished. Our greatest danger, however, arose from the frequent arrival at Koil of large bands of mutineers from Oudh and the districts which had been abandoned. When we felt unable to face those in the open field, we occasionally harassed their movements, by firing at their advanced guards, and then made an orderly retreat to some position capable in a certain measure of defence. We were never attacked by those parties, owing to their anxiety to reach Delhi. Our military duties were very heavy; not a night passed but we were told off for either sentry or patrol; and during the day, when not employed on some expedition, we were without the convenience or even necessaries of life; and it was considered a luxury to get a thatch or tree to sleep under. I consider myself bound to remark here that, so long as the volunteers remained in the district, their conduct was soldier-like and creditable, and many displayed a dashing courage which was afterwards memorably proved at Agra on the 5th of July, and at Aligarh on the 24th of August.\"\n\nAbout the 21st June the Lieutenant-Governor recalled most of the volunteers to Agra, and there remained with Mr. Watson but eleven men. With this reduced force Aligarh was again abandoned, and the deserted factory of Mandrak, situated about seven\n\n---\n\n1 Messrs Cocks and Outram of the Civil Service; Ensigns Marsh and Olivant; Dr. Stewart Clark and Messrs. F. Saunders, J. Tandy, H. B. Harlington, Hind, Castle, and Burkinyoung.\nmiles from Aligarh on the Agra road, was occupied. At the same time Captain Burlton held S\u00e1\u015bni between Mandr\u00e1k and H\u00e1thras, and Captain Alexander remained at H\u00e1thras. From Mandr\u00e1k various expeditions were undertaken to the different towns, and the month of June passed by without anything more stirring than the news brought by camel-riders of fresh mutinies and whispers of a projected rising amongst the Gwaliar troopers at S\u00e1\u015bni and H\u00e1thras. A jahdd was preached in the town of Koil, and the jahddis boasted that they would fix the heads of the Europeans on the gates of the city before night. On the 2nd July news came of the mutiny of the Gwaliar troopers, and on the same day some one thousand of the Musalm\u00e1n rabble of Koil appeared before Mandr\u00e1k. Mr. Cooks writes:\u2014\"On that date (2nd July), at 3 p.m., we sat down to our mess dinner. In the midst of it we heard the buzz of an enraged populace; soon tom-toms were beating, flags flying, and the country swarming with white clothes, each Government chauki in a blaze added to the excitement of the scene. Scarcely a word was spoken, but each seemed to understand his neighbour's thoughts, saddled his horse, and drew his sword. We rode forth, the gallant Watson at our head. On reaching the road we were met by a salute from a hundred matchlocks; a hundred more were aimed, but missed fire, owing to the damp state of the atmosphere. \"Charge\" was the order, and well was it obeyed. Stirrup to stirrup, and man to man, we dashed through the mass of cowards, scattering them like so many sheep, and not stopping till nearly 15 corpses remained as trophies of our victory. Watson was wounded, as was his horse, and two or three got contusions. When we charged, I believe not one expected to have come back alive; and when darkness compelled our return, it was with feelings of intense satisfaction and thankfulness that we finished our repast and talked over our escapes and adventures.\" It is such gallant acts as this that have won us India, and that will keep India, and I have no doubt that when occasion arises, Englishmen will always be found ready to emulate the heroes of 1857.\n\nThe same day the traitorous Gwaliar Cavalry broke out into open mutiny, and their officers were obliged to fly to Agra. This necessitated the retreat of the gallant volunteers, and, sad to relate, the noble Watson died of cholera at Agra. Naturally of a weak constitution, the exposure and anxiety rendered him an easy prey to Asiatic cholera, and no less a victim to the mutiny than those who died on the field. One who knew him well writes:\u2014\"I fully believe he had, from the commencement of the outbreak, made up his mind to be killed or die in the defence of the district in which he took so much interest.\" So long as he remained in Aligarh communication with Meerut was maintained, and the establishment of a rebel government in Koil was delayed.\n\nFrom the 2nd July, 1857, until the 24th August, 1857, the district was in the hands of the rebels. A committee (panch\u00e1yat) was formed to preserve order and save the city of Koil.\nfrom plunder by the Mewatis, butchers, and other low Musalmans. One Nasimullah, a vakil of the Judge's Court, took umbrage at his exclusion from the panchayat and invited Muhammad Ghaus Khan, of Sikandra Rao, to Koil. Nayaz Ahmad, Inspector of Schools, assisted Nasimullah, and both procured for Muhammad Ghaus Khan the appointment of deputy from Walidad Khan of Masagarh in the Balandshahr district. They ousted the committee of safety, and Nasimullah became sub deputy governor of Koil, Mahbub Khan was created tahsildar, and Hasan Khan was placed in charge of the police (kotwal). Forces were levied and the police and jail guards took service with the usurpers, but Ghaus Khan never extended his power beyond the city and never collected any revenue. On the 20th August, Mr. Cocks, with a force under Major Montgomery, was despatched from Agra to succour Hathras, which was supposed to be threatened by the Koil rebels. On the 24th the British force moved upon Koil and attacked the rebels under Ghaus Khan and Maulvi Abdul Jalil near the garden of Man Singh close to the city. The rebels were defeated, the Maulvi himself was killed, and the Musalmans abandoned the city. Mr. Cocks was accompanied in his advance by the troops of the Mursan Raja and Thakur (afterwards Raja) Gobind Singh. To the latter was assigned the charge of the city, with the aid of a council composed of Attab Rai, an experienced old tahsildar, Sundar Lal, a Subordinate Judge, and Rai Durga Parshad, a Deputy Collector. All the tahsilis were reoccupied, though the authority of the officers was necessarily, but weakly, established. On the 25th September Gobind Singh was surprised by a rebel force under Nasimullah and expelled from the city, and on the same day the tahsildar of Atrauli was murdered at his post. The following day Major Montgomery's force was obliged to leave Hathras to avoid the large force of rebels in retreat from Delhi. This body of rebels arrived at Hathras, on the 3rd October and Sikandra Rao on the 4th, where they halted on the 5th, and marched again southward on the 6th.\n\nOn the 5th Colonel Greathed's column occupied Koil without resistance. The rebels fled to Akrabad pursued by Major Ouvry's Lancers, when many of the Gujar raiders were punished. Akrabad was occupied on the 6th, and the rebel leaders Mangal Singh and Mahtab Rai were slain, and a considerable number of guns and much ammunition was captured. Colonel Greathed's column arrived at Agra on the 10th October, and shortly after the action of the Karwan Nadi, Mr. Cocks with Major Eld, 150 Europeans, two guns, 100 Sikhs, and Mr. Bramly as Magistrate, were sent to re-occupy the district. They took possession of the fort and easily held their own. The police and revenue establishments were strengthened, Gobind Singh was reinstated in Koil, and the collection of the land-revenue proceeded steadily with the returning confidence in the stability of our Government. Payment, except in a few cases, was withheld only where there was real inability to pay. During the month of November\nthe district was continually harassed by flying parties of rebels proceeding from across the Jumna eastwards: but these did little or no harm in their passage, though they caused a great feeling of insecurity at our police and revenue posts, where the mere cry of 'rebels' was sufficient to put to flight the raw levies.\n\nIn December a body of the Fatehgarh rebels threatened the district from the south. Colonel Farquhar, commanding in Bulandshahr, deemed it advisable to march in their direction with a view to holding them in check, if possible, until the arrival of the column which was being formed at Dehli and Meerut under Colonel Seaton, C.B., to convey a quantity of stores and ammunition for the use of the troops at Cawnpore. The Bulandshahr force occupied Pindriwal, and marched thence by Atranli to Chharra, a small village close to the residence of Daud Khan, talukadar of Bhikampur. On the 11th December Colonel Seaton's column arrived at Aligarh, and on the 14th joined the Bulandshahr force, and the same day completely routed the enemy at the Nim Nadi. After this the Doab was completely cleared of the rebels, and the only danger lay on the Rohilkhand side, for even after the occupation of Fatehgarh the whole river face between it and Aligarh was at the mercy of the rebels. In March, 1858, General Penny's force marched down and took up a position at Patiali, and afforded some show of protection.\n\nThe old Rajput and Jat fuds broke out with their accustomed fury during the mutiny. In the western portions of the district, and especially towards Sadabad of Muttra, internal struggles raged until the fall of Dehli. The feeling of animosity between the Musalmans and Hind\u00fas was also generally very bitter, especially after the excesses of Nasimullah and the elevation of Thakur Gobind Singh. No officer of Government above the rank of zamindar of police joined the rebels except the Inspector of Schools and the Jailor. Only one Christian was murdered, and Mr. Hoggan and his family, (five persons) were kept concealed in a sweeper's house in Koil for six days after the departure of the Europeans, whilst Mr. Ryan of Nanu was rescued by a zamindar and sent into Hathras. One large indigo factory was plundered and burned by the villagers, and three others by the mutineer troops. The remainder were saved by the village zamindars. The records of the head-quarters offices and those of four out of eight tahsils were destroyed and the towns of Khair and Hardaaganj were plundered. Mr. Bramly thus sums up his experiences of the mutiny:\u2014\"Little trust can be placed in the humanity of the lower classes, whether Hind\u00fa or Musalm\u00e1n. They have proved themselves little better than savages, and all that can be said is that they treat us not worse, but perhaps better than they treated each other. Though aid in the struggle has been rendered us in many instances by the natives, especially by the Hind\u00fas after they had a foretaste of a Musalm\u00e1n government, still their general attitude\nmust be characterized as apathetic. The large number of persons who had so much to gain from the overthrow of our Government was content to annex their lost estates and await the result of the struggle. That the people plundered when they suddenly found authority overthrown by the mutinous troops and anarchy ready made for them was natural. What people would have done otherwise, but to take an active part and assist the mutineers, the small Muhammadan section excepted, they showed in this district little desire. Much as they love plunder, they love life and security more; and the same with the sepoys. A hard contest, even though successful, formed no part of their programme. The treacherous and easy slaughter of their officers and other Europeans, accompanied with the certain plunder of treasuries, the wiping out of debts, and the prospect of a new r\u00e9gime in which they must necessarily play a leading part, was the pleasing picture they had before them, when they shouted 'din! din!' The storming of forts and entrenchments, though held by a few Europeans, and they worn and exhausted, was a service of danger to meet which there was no sense of duty of spirit or patriotism, no sense of injuries to be avenged, to spur them on. In such a cause they could not meet death.\"\n\nThe confiscations for rebellion amounted to 21,912 acres, paying a land-revenue of Rs. 34,708. These punishments were imposed more for isolated acts of plunder amongst the people themselves than for overt acts of rebellion against the Government.\n\n| Tahsil | Areas confiscated in acres | Land revenue in rupees | Tahsil | Areas confiscated in acres | Land revenue in rupees |\n|--------|--------------------------|-----------------------|--------|--------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Atrauli | ... | 1,352 | 2,195 | Khair | ... | 5,810 | 8,550 |\n| Koil | ... | 4,969 | 6,959 | H\u00e2tiras | ... | 1,116 | 2,616 |\n| Igl\u00e1s | ... | 8,650 | 8,798 | Sikandra | ... | 5,566 | 5,589 |\n\nWith the exception of malarious fevers, there are no endemic diseases prevalent in the district. The country is flat, and level, and in many cases it has been found very difficult to carry off the extra moisture caused by the canal. The natural drainage lines are shallow, sluggish streams incapable of further extension as receptacles for the excessive rain-fall: hence swamps arise, and with them appear the malarious fevers. Some improvement has taken place near Koil and in other parts of the district by judicious draining, and with the increase in cultivation and the planting of trees the general health seems to have improved throughout the district. Cholera first broke out in 1817 and committed great ravages. In 1821 again cholera visited the district, and the people say that \"firewood...\"\nbecame scarce in consequence of the quantity used for burning the dead.\" The next cholera year was 1827, following on the famine of 1825-26, and again after the chaurdhanwe famine of 1837-38 cholera raged. From June to August, 1856, and after the famine of 1860-61, cholera was again very destructive in this district. In 1837 a malignant typhoid fever broke out in the S\u00e1sni subdivision. Some say that it was conveyed into the district by travellers from Bombay; others that it was due to the fact that some Cham\u00e1rs had eaten the decayed flesh of a cow that had died of the murrain which raged at the same time. The fever held possession of the patient for four or five days, and ended in delirium, during which the crisis took place. This epidemic lasted for six months. In 1856 fever followed the cholera epidemic of that year, and extended its ravages well on into the cold-weather. This outbreak was characterised by its rapid course in individual cases, and death generally resulted on the fourth day after seizure, while those who survived this period ultimately recovered. It was calculated that 34,000 persons died during its prevalence, or three per cent. of the total population. Fever also followed the famine of 1860-61, especially in Koil and Hardnaganj. It broke out in April and May, when the fresh grain was brought into the market, and, the old stocks having been exhausted, was, at once, used for food. In February, 1850, there was an outbreak of small-pox, which was much intensified by the imperfect disposal of the bodies of those who had died of the disease. The following statement, compiled from the sanitary reports, gives the mortuary statistics of the district for the years 1867 to 1873:\n\n| Year | Fever | Small-pox | Bowel complaints | Cholera | Other causes | Total | Percentage of deaths to 1,000 of the population |\n|------|-------|-----------|-----------------|---------|--------------|-------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| 1867 | 6,066 | 486       | 1,023           | 1,104   | 1,965        | 10,604| 11'4                                          |\n| 1868 | 5,662 | 1,938     | 967             | 106     | 1,768        | 10,441| 11'2                                          |\n| 1869 | 6,668 | 6,449     | 1,601           | 499     | 1,819        | 16,966| 18'3                                          |\n| 1870 | 8,603 | 518       | ...             | 68      | 3,419        | 13,606| 13'60                                         |\n| 1871 | 12,954| 701       | 2,098           | 61      | 1,824        | 17,338| 18'69                                         |\n| 1872 | 15,307| 598       | 8,036           | 799     | 1,933        | 21,027| 19'85                                         |\n| 1873 | 14,063| 4,678     | 4,152           | 350     | 1,605        | 24,848| 23'13                                         |\n\nIn 1873-74 there were 14,743 vaccine operations, of which 12,229 were successful, 1,637 were unsuccessful, and the results in 877 cases were unknown.\nAmongst the deaths from other causes the following are recorded as due to injuries:\n\n| Year | Suicide | Wounds | Accidents | Snake-bites |\n|------|---------|--------|-----------|-------------|\n|      | Male    | Female | Total     | Male        | Female     | Total     | Male    | Female | Total |\n| 1871 | 23      | 9      | 32        | 6           | 10         | 16        | 75      | 83     | 158    | 16     | 18     | 34     | 240    |\n| 1872 | 37      | 16     | 43        | 29          | 27         | 56        | 64      | 72     | 136    | 47     | 33     | 80     | 315    |\n| 1873 | 8       | 27     | 35        | 7           | 4          | 11        | 30      | 30     | 60     | 11     | 12     | 23     | 129    |\n\nCattle disease is very common, and assumes a virulent form in the rainy season. The poor half-starved cattle gorge themselves with the rank grass which flourishes as soon as the rain falls. Foot-and-mouth disease seems to be produced by the cattle standing in and cropping the wet herbage in the rains. The local treatment of this disease consists in placing the hoof of the animal on a heated brick and washing the diseased part with wine (shardd) and water. A mash of d\u0101l (split pulse), flour and oil is also given. In b\u0101dan or dysentery, black-pepper, ghi, aniseed, sugar, and rice-water are the remedies employed. In aphara or windy colic, ammonia, salt, borax, and g\u016br are given. Cattle disease is also attributed to the existence of a noxious insect on certain grasses during the rains. In 1871 it was estimated that about one thousand head of cattle died of these diseases during the year.\n\nAmongst the indigenous drugs used by the native physicians in this district the following may be mentioned:\u2014Opium as a sedative; capsules of the poppy plant as a stimulant and expectorant; ispaghul (Plantago ispaghula) useful in diarrhoea; bel (\u00c6gle marmelo) as a tonic and febrifuge; pomegranate fruit in dysentery; flowers of the madar (Calotropis Hamiltoni) used in cholera and dyspepsia; tobacco used as a sternatatory; tulsi (Ocymum sanctum) a demulcent; imli or tamarind used as a laxative; amalt\u0101s (Cassia fistula) used as a purgative; castor-oil; dhat\u00e9ra (Datura alba) in cough and leprosy; gum arabic, muriate of ammonia, and ginger are also used. Dr. Jackson thus describes the local practice of medicine in this district:\u2014\"The treatment adopted by both Hind\u00fa and Musalm\u00e1n physicians is based on a system of physiology which divides the active principles in the system into air, blood, and bile, and the remedies are divided into hot and cold, as also the temperament. The system has been handed down for ages, and is the very essence of empiricism. The Muhammadan hakim is certainly ahead of the Hind\u00fa, having less faith in mantras.\"\nand charms, and it is not uncommon to find him well versed in European remedies. He looks on derangement of the stomach and digestion as the source of all disease. The stomach is likened to a retort, gases from which during the process of digestion proceed to the brain, where they are distilled in the form of fluid which may exercise a most pernicious effect. Filtering downwards this fluid causes catarrh, and attacking the lungs is the source of hemoptysis and consumption, and, if it finds its way to the intestinal canal, dysenteries, cholera, and other bowel complaints are the result. In the treatment of disease the hakim has travelled in the same groove as his forefathers, and his patient is perfectly satisfied with hot and cold remedies, while the result, successful or the reverse, is attributed with stoical resignation to all-powerful kismet.\"\n\nThere were dispensaries at Koil, H\u00e1thras, Sikandra Rao, and Khair in 1872, which treated 12,915 out-door patients and 742 in-door patients. The Koil dispensary was established by private subscriptions through Mr. Blunt in 1849, and was placed under Government in 1851, when branch dispensaries were also opened at Sikandra Rao and H\u00e1thras. In 1853 the average attendance at these three dispensaries was 3,328 per annum, it is now 3,414. In 1872, Mr. Bramley, C.S., gave a good house to the Koil dispensary, which now affords ample accommodation to the whole city.\nGAZETTEER\nOF THE\nALIGARH DISTRICT.\n\nCONTENTS.\n\n| Page | Page | Page |\n|------|------|------|\n| Ahan or Ehan | ... 508 | Gharbara | ... 546 | Koil parganah | ... 578 |\n| Akabad village | ... ib. | Gorai | ... ib. | Koil tahsil | ... 582 |\n| Akabad parganah | ... 509 | Hasangarh | ... 549 | Mahn | ... 584 |\n| Aligarh | ... 513 | Hathras Bhagwanpur | ... 552 | Mandrak | ... ib. |\n| Atrauli town | ... 525 | Hathras town | ... ib. | Mendu | ... ib. |\n| Atrauli parganah | ... 527 | Hathras parganah | ... 557 | Mitai | ... ib. |\n| Atrauli tahsil | ... 532 | Hathras tahsil | ... 564 | Morhal | ... ib. |\n| Barnali village | ... 533 | Hardaganj | ... 565 | Mursan town | ... 588 |\n| Barnali taluka | ... ib. | Hussain | ... 567 | Mursan parganah | ... 589 |\n| Beswan | ... 536 | Iglia or Agila | ... ib. | Pilkhana | ... 592 |\n| Bijalgarh | ... ib. | Iglia tahsil | ... ib. | Plawna | ... 593 |\n| Chandaus town | ... 537 | Jalail | ... 569 | Purdilagar | ... ib. |\n| Chandaus parganah | ... ib. | Jarauli | ... 571 | Salimpur | ... ib. |\n| Chhara Rafaipur | ... 542 | Jalari | ... ib. | Sani | ... ib. |\n| Dadoon | ... ib. | Jawla | ... ib. | Sikandra Rao town | ... 594 |\n| Darlyspur | ... 543 | Kachaura | ... 572 | Sikandra Rao parganah | ... 597 |\n| Datauli | ... ib. | Kanriyaganj | ... ib. | Sikandra Rao tahsil | ... 603 |\n| Gangiri parganah | ... ib. | Khair | ... ib. | Somna | ... 606 |\n| Gangiri village | ... 545 | Khair parganah | ... 573 | Tappal town | ... 606 |\n| Gaunda | ... 546 | Khair tahsil | ... 577 | Tappal parganah | ... 607 |\n\nAhan or Ehan, a town parganah H\u00e1thras of the Aligarh district, is distant 10 miles from H\u00e1thras and 25 miles from Aligarh. In 1865 there were 1,296 inhabitants, and in 1872 there were 1,380. It has a police-station.\n\nAkabad, a village in parganah Akabad and tahsil Sikandra of the Aligarh district, is situated on the Grand Trunk Road, 12 miles from Aligarh and 11 miles from Sikandra. The population in 1861 was 2,008; in 1865, 2,199; and in 1872, 2,197. There is a police-station, encamping-ground, and munsif here. The Chaukid\u00e1ri Act (XX. of 1856) is in force in Akabad, and in 1873 supported a village police numbering six men of all grades, at an annual cost of\nRs. 324. The number of the houses in the town in 1872-3 was 477, and of these, 460 were assessed with a house-tax averaging Re. 0-13-3 per house and Re. 0-2-1 per head of the population per annum. The income for the same year was Rs. 532, including a balance of Rs. 149 from the previous year, and the expenditure was Rs. 520. In 1857 Mangal Singh and Mahtab Rai of Akabad not only allowed their followers to plunder the tahsil after the mutineers had looted the treasure, but refused all aid to the tahsildar, and lived a life of open rebellion. On the 6th October, 1857, Akabad was captured by Colonel Greathed's column, and the two rebel leaders were captured, tried, and executed. Their brethren, Tej Singh and Jawahir Singh, proved loyal. Akabad or Akbarabad is said to have been founded by the Emperor Akbar during one of his hunting excursions.\n\nAkabad or Akbarabad, a parganah of the Aligarh district, is bounded on the north by parganah Gangiri; on the south by parganahs Hathras and Sikandra; on the east by Gangiri and Sikandra; and on the west by Koil and Hathras. According to the settlement records, Akabad in 1873 comprised an area of 74,226 acres, of which 19,392 acres were unassessable, 5,052 acres were culturable, and 49,852 acres were cultivated. The physical features of the parganah present no peculiarities, being a level plain bounded by the Kali or Kalindri Nadi on the north-east, and the Isan for a short distance on the south-west. There are a few small jhils at Gopi, Akabad, and Golshah Sahawali. At the last place the fourth division of the Ganges Canal branches off for Etawa. The Grand Trunk Road to Meerut runs through Akabad, which is also connected by cross roads with Jalali, Barla, and Bijaigarh, and externally with Sasi, and through Kauniyaganj with Kasganj. The principal towns are Akabad, Pilkhana, Bijaigarh, and Kauniyaganj.\n\nThe parganah is made up of portions of parganah Jalali on the north and parganah Akabad or Akbarabad on the south. These were originally separate tahsils, the head-quarters of Jalali being at Pilkhana; but they were united in 1840, and the head-quarters were fixed at Akabad on the Grand Trunk Road. Both parganahs belong to the Ceded Provinces. At the revision of settlement under Regulation IX. of 1833, parganahs Pachlana and Gangiri belonged to the Akabad tahsil, and were subsequently transferred to Atrauli in exchange for taluka Datauli. Similarly, parganah Jalali contained taluka Sasi, transferred in 1840 to Hathras. Akabad and Jalali were settled by Messrs. H. Rose and W. B. Wright in 1839, and Datauli by Mr. J. Thornton in 1836. The proportion of irrigation in Akabad at the settlement was 59 per cent., and in numbers of the estates kuchcha wells were impracticable. In Jalali the percentage of irrigation was 76. The increase in the former was Rs. 1,674, falling at Re. 1-14-6 on the\n\n1 Pachlana is now in the Eta district.\ncultivated, and at Re. 1-12-6 on the assessed area per acre; in the latter the increase was Rs. 932.\n\nThe new settlement has been made by Mr. W. H. Smith, and shows the following statistics:\n\n| Total area | Cultivable area | Cultivated area |\n|------------|----------------|----------------|\n|            |                |                |\n| Acres      | Acres          | Acres          |\n| 74,326     | 153            | 19,169         |\n|            |                |                |\n|            |                |                |\n|            |                |                |\n\nThe percentage of unassessable land to the total area is 26, and of the culturable area to the total area is 74, but 92 per cent. of the culturable area is cultivated, and 91 per cent. of the cultivated area is irrigated. There has been an immense increase in the proportion of irrigation to cultivation since the last settlement, entirely due to the opening of the canal. The new assessment amounts to Rs. 1,30,980 for land revenue, and Rs. 13,098 for cesses. The initial revenue of the past settlement stood at Rs. 92,817, and the expiring revenue at Rs. 90,627, thus giving an actual increase of Rs. 40,353, or 44 per cent. The incidence of the new revenue on cultivation is Rs. 2-10-0 per acre, against a former incidence of Re. 1-14-11. The results of the last settlement, as regards the transfer of property, show that 8,202 acres were farmed on account of arrears of revenue, whilst the changes due to voluntary transfers, such as private sale, mortgage, &c., and to transfers by auction under orders of the Civil Courts, were as follow:\n\n| Area in acres | Land revenue | Price per acre | Years' purchase |\n|---------------|--------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Private sale  | 17,070       | Rs.           | Rs. a. p.      |\n| Mortgage      | 16,415       | 21,770        | 18 0 7         |\n| Auction       | 11,914       | 29,474        | 10 0 1         |\n| Total         | 45,399       | 58,984        | 9 11 0         |\n\nThe selling price of land in this parganah is shown to have risen soon after the expiry of the first decade of Mr. Thornton's settlement. From 1889 to 1848 the price fetched by land at private sales was 8\u00bd years' purchase of the land-revenue; in the next ten years this had risen to ten years, and in the last decade to eleven years. The permanent transfers from the old proprietors have amounted to 41\u00b73 per cent. of the total area, whilst mortgages are only 11\u00b74 per cent.\nOut of 24 villages owned by the Pundir Thakur of Bijaigarh, only 17 now remain to him. Rajputs, Brahmins, Kirars, and Musalmans have been the principal losers. In this parganah, out of 40,990 acres transferred, 25,922 acres belonged to persons who owned three-fourths or more of an estate. The following statement shows more clearly the nature of the changes amongst the proprietary body from 1838 to 1868:\n\n| Caste | Area held in 1838 in acres | Lost between 1838 and 1868 by Sale | Mortgage, &c. | Total | Remaining |\n|-------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------|-------|-----------|\n|       |                           |                                   |               |       |           |\n| Brahman | 3,649                     | 480                               | 411           | 891   | 2,758     |\n| Khatri | 1,327                     | 1,327                             |               |       |           |\n| Kayath | 6,316                     | 3,507                             | 1,006         | 3,512 | 2,704     |\n| Rajput | 51,561                    | 21,011                            | 9,335         | 20,69 | 21,318    |\n| Goshain | 339                      | 259                               |               | 245   | 80        |\n| Dhaseer | 3,114                    |                                   |               |       |           |\n\nOf the 110 estates found in the parganah during the year of measurement, 77 were held in zamindari and 33 in imperfect pattidari tenure. Thirty-four per cent. of the total area was held by proprietors possessing more than one village; 36 per cent. by proprietors who were less than six in number, and possessed one village or less than one village; and the remainder by proprietors who numbered over six sharers. The percentage of the land-revenue paid by each of these classes was 32-5, 40, and 27-5 per cent. respectively. Kharif crops during the season of measurement occupied 22,144 acres of the cultivated area, and the rabi crops covered 27,698 acres. Amongst the kharif crops, cotton occupied 7,470 acres, jodr 8,126 acres, indigo 3,039 acres, and bajra 2,226 acres. The principal rabi crops were wheat, 22,144 acres; barley, 12,425 acres; bajar, 5,656 acres; and goji, 4,747 acres. 497 holdings were held by proprietors as seer, 2,541 by hereditary tenants, and 1,724 by tenants-at-will. Only 6 acres out of 49,842 acres leased to tenants paid rent in kind, and the average rental per acre was Rs. 4-6-4, viz., Rs. 4-1-8 for hereditary tenants and Rs. 4-12-0 for tenants-at-will. Seventeen per cent. of the total area is held as seer by proprietors, 46 per cent. is cultivated by hereditary tenants, and 37 per cent. by tenants-at-will. The average area of the holdings of each class is 17 acres, 8-9 acres, and 10-6 acres respectively. In 1855 hereditary tenants possessed 996 holdings,\naveraging 12\u00b74 acres, and paying an average rental of Rs. 3-10-6 per acre, whilst tenants-at-will cultivated 2,466 holdings, averaging 12\u00b76 acres each, and paying an average rental of Rs. 4-3-11 per acre. Altogether here, as in Sikandra Rao, the rental has increased, whilst the average area of the holdings has decreased.\n\nAccording to the census of 1872 pargana Akrabad contained 87 inhabited villages, of which 13 had less than 200 inhabitants, 33 had between 200 and 500, 25 had between 500 and 1,000, 10 had between 1,000 and 2,000, 2 had between 2,000 and 3,000, and 3 had between 3,000 and 5,000. The only town containing more than 5,000 inhabitants is Bijaigarh, with 5,652. The settlement records show that there are 113 mahals or estates in the parganah, containing 89 villages, which have an average area of 834 acres each. The total population in 1872 numbered 64,747 souls (29,731 females), giving 566 to the square mile. Classified according to religion, there were 56,898 Hind\u00fas, of whom 25,990 were females; 7,845 Musalm\u00e1ns, amongst whom 3,739 were females; and 4 Christians. Distributing the Hind\u00fa population amongst the four great classes, the census shows 7,585 Brahmans, of whom 3,417 were females; 7,448 Rajputs, including 3,261 females; 3,232 Baniyas (1,519 females); whilst the great mass of the population is included in \"the other castes\" of the census returns, which show a total of 38,638 souls, of whom 17,793 are females. The principal Brahman subdivisions found in this parganah are the Gaur (412), Saraswat (214), and San\u00e1dh (162). The Rajputs belong to the Gahlot (199), Chauh\u00e1n (435), Badg\u00fajar (115), J\u00e1don (489), Jangh\u00e1ra, Tomar, Pundir, and Panw\u00e1r clans. The Baniyas are chiefly Agarw\u00e1ls (369), Chaussains (143), Dasas, Mathuriyas, and Jaisw\u00e1rs. The principal divisions of the other castes are the J\u00e1t, Son\u00e1r, Barhai (1,300), Hajj\u00e1m (1,287), R\u00e1j, M\u00e1l\u00ed, Bh\u00e1t, Kal\u00e9l (1,904), Gosh\u00e1in, Ahir (2,901), K\u00e1hh\u00ed (1,455), Joshi, Darzi, Kah\u00e1r (1,910), Jogi, Bair\u00e1g\u00ed, Dhobi, Loh\u00e1r, Koli (1,276), Cham\u00e1r (9,843), Khat\u00edk, Kh\u00e1krob (1,547), Kumh\u00e1r, Garariya (3,741), Aheriya (726), Orh, Banj\u00e1ra, Kayath, Lodha (2,068), Dhuna, Bharbh\u00fanja, Teli, Kanjar, Ghosi, Chhipi, B\u00e1ri, and Nuniya. The Musalm\u00e1ns are distributed amongst Shaikhs (1,545), Sayyids (258), Mughals (116), and Path\u00e1ns (508); the remainder are unspecified.\n\nThe occupations of the people are shown in the statistics collected at the census of 1872. From these it appears that of the male adult population (not less than fifteen years of age), 256 are employed in professional avocations, such as Government servants, priests, doctors, and the like; 2,782 in domestic service, as personal servants, water-carriers, barbers, sweepers, washermen, &c.; 2,106 in commerce, in buying, selling, keeping or lending money or goods, or the conveyance of\n\n---\n\n1 See Rev. Rep., N. S., II, 105.\nmen, animals, or goods; 9,388 in agricultural operations; 2,830 in industrial occupations, arts and mechanics, and the preparation of all classes of substances, vegetable, mineral and animal. There were 4,234 persons returned as labourers, and 367 as of no specified occupation. Taking the total population, irrespective of age or sex, the same returns give 1,475 as landholders, 25,251 as cultivators, and 38,021 as engaged in occupations unconnected with agriculture. The educational statistics, which are confessedly imperfect, show 1,328 males as able to read and write out of a total male population numbering 36,016 souls. In 1863, 22 villages of Akrabad were transferred to Atrauli, aggregating 43,624 acres and giving a land-revenue of Rs. 50,707, and in 1862, 23 villages were transferred to parganah Koil, and 4 to Hathras.\n\nALIGARH, the head-quarters of the district, with the town of Koil, may, for all practical purposes, be regarded as one and the same place. Aligarh is so called from the neighbouring fort of that name, known at different times as Muhammadgarh, S\u00e1bitgarh, R\u00e1mgarh, and, since the time of Najf Kh\u00e1n as Aligarh. It lies in latitude 27\u00b0-55'-41\" and longitude 78\u00b0-6'-45.\"\n\nIn 1847 the city of Koil had 36,181 inhabitants; in 1853 the population numbered 55,001, and in 1865 there were 48,403 inhabitants. The site has an area of 400 square acres, giving 146 souls to the acre. According to the census of 1872 there were 58,539 inhabitants, of whom 39,012 were Hind\u00fas (17,343 females), 19,489 were Musalm\u00e1ns (9,423 females), and 38 were Christians (12 females.) Distributing the population amongst the rural and urban classes, the returns show 417 landholders, 1,982 cultivators, and 54,128 persons pursuing occupations unconnected with agriculture. The number of enclosures in 1872 was 7,142, of which 2,571 were occupied by Musalm\u00e1ns. The number of houses during the same year was 11,276, of which 3,963 were built with skilled labour, and of these 995 were occupied by Musalm\u00e1ns. Of the 7,313 mud huts in the town, 3,153 were owned by persons of the same religion. Taking the male adult population, 19,718 souls (not less than fifteen years of age), we find the following occupations pursued by more than fifty adult males:\u2014Attornies, 61; barbers, 322; beggars, 478; blacksmiths, 189; bricklayers, 179; butchers, 271; carpenters, 202; carpet-makers, 104; cartmen, 406; cotton-cleaners, 82; dancing boys, 144; druggists, 86; dyers, 416; flour-dealers, 82; goldsmiths, 219; grain-dealers, 184; grain-parchers, 127; green-grocers, 167; inn-keepers, 129; labourers, 3,300; leather-dyers, 380; lime-burners, 82; merchants, 506; money-lenders, 215; oil-makers, 98; painters, 71; porters, 498; potters, 160; purohits, 121; servants, 6,368; shopkeepers, 1,557; sieve-makers, 67; sweepers, 289; tailors, 161; tobacconists, 79; washermen, 214; water-carriers, 423; weavers, 1,719; and wine-sellers, 214. From these figures it would appear that the population has increased by 22,358 souls since 1847.\nKoil is rather a handsome town in its general appearance, and is particularly well situated. The centre of the town is occupied by the high site of an old Dor fort, now crowned by S\u00e1bit Kh\u00e1n's mosque, which forms a conspicuous object in the landscape from whichever side the town is approached. The precincts of the mosque have been much improved of late years by clearing and levelling the space around and paving it with kunkur. The new tahsil, also, is placed here, and, close to it, a number of fine shops have been built by the municipality. From this central space one wide road runs to the north-east, to the railway station, and another runs westward to the Khair road, whilst it is contemplated to make a third road to the southward, to eventually wind to the westward and open up a portion of the city that most needs improvement. The really business part of the city lies to the eastward, between the high central site and the railway. The principal bazarway runs from north to south, and is crossed by the road to the railway station, and a branch connecting it with the Grand Trunk Road, which serves as the main line of communication for the east of the town. The road from Muttra to R\u00e1mghat, on the Ganges, also furnishes an important commercial way. All these roads are well made, drained and paved with kunkur, and even many of the small connecting ways are paved, and all are drained to a certain extent. The smaller lanes have room for improvement, but vigorous efforts are being made by the municipality, and it is hoped that within a few years the whole town will be effectually paved and drained. The situation is decidedly healthy, and the facilities for drainage, on the whole, are fairly good. The heavy rains of 1871 and 1874, however, caused considerable lodgements of surface water in some places, but the remedy for this is practicable. In the principal streets the houses are chiefly built of bricks, but the greater number are made of earth. The outskirts, especially to the east and south, are low, so that the drainage there passes off very slowly, and, as a rule, they are not so well kept as the interior of the town.\n\nThe town contains 101 muhallas or wards, many of which go by the name subdivisions of the town of Sar\u00e1i, as Hak\u00edm-ke-Sar\u00e1i, Babu-ke-Sar\u00e1i, and the like. A good part of the town probably originated in clusters of sar\u00e1s\u00eds, this being a central halting-place for travellers to Dehli, Agra, Muttra, Rohilkhand, &c. The northern part of the principal bazarway is called Miy\u00e1nganj, and from it branch off the large market-place of the same name and Perronganj. Russellganj was founded by Mr. Claude Russell in 1805, and in rivalry with it, one Hak\u00edm Asad Ali built the sar\u00e1\u00ed known by his name. The descendants of the Hak\u00edm still reside in the city in very poor circumstances. Neither De Boigne nor Perron did anything for the city. De Boigne's residence lay outside the city towards the fort, and is the same as that occupied by Perron before the siege in 1803. It is called the S\u00e1hib Bagh.\nIt consists of a large two-storeyed building situated in the midst of a garden and surrounded by a high wall and bastions. It was here that Perron held his court and kept a garrison consisting of his body-guard and a few artillery with light field-pieces. Of late years it has been used as a settlement office, but is now in a very dilapidated condition. Portions of the premises still belong to the Messieurs Derridon, great-grandsons of M. Perron's sister, and there are still some remains of the bastion and the garden. Perron had another large garden opposite Thornton's factory, now occupied by one Nasr-ullah. Both Perron and De Boigne were fond of gardening, and formed plantations of fruit trees obtained from all parts of India, and even from Europe and Persia. M. Pedron, who commanded in Aligarh at the conquest in 1803, had his house in the midst of an extensive garden, where the Judge's Court now stands. Dudreney lived in a house in the outskirts now occupied by one Khushwakt Ali. The city in De Boigne's time extended only as far as the large masonry building on the edge of Perronganj, and that quarter is still known as Aligarh darw\u0101za. Beyond this house to the north-west there was only a bare open plain; close to it, on the road, were the cotton screws and indigo factories of Mr. John Thornton, one of the first planters in the district. Mr. Longcroft's factories lay on the Meerut road, where the remains of old vats are yet to be seen, and his garden is now in the possession of one Badari Parsad. Messrs. Robertson and Stewart had also residences near the city. Mr. John Thornton's house was recently purchased by Mr. Bramly, C.S., and presented to the city for a dispensary. Kinlochganj, named after the Collector of that name, stands on the site of S\u00e1bit Kh\u00e1n's garden, and contains S\u00e1bit Kh\u00e1n's tomb and those of his family. S\u00e1bit Kh\u00e1n purchased many estates for his family, but through extravagance and carelessness his descendants are now in penury, and the only sign now remaining of their former position is the self-assumed title of Naw\u00e1b.\n\nNaw\u00e1b S\u00e1bit Kh\u00e1n's mosque stands on an eminence in the centre of the city known as the B\u00e1l\u00e1 Kila. From the inscription given in the history of the district (page 498) it appears to have been commenced in 1724 A.D., and it was finished in 1728 A.D. The architecture is the debased style of the last century. The building has five cupolas,\u2014three in the middle and one on each side. The side cupolas are of the peculiar shape which Mr. Ferguson declares to be borrowed from the bambu roof of a hut in the Lower Provinces; yet the mosque, as seen from a distance, is by no means without beauty and even dignity. The materials are block kunkur, brick in the domes, and here and there red sandstone. The last must have been brought from some place beyond the Jumna. The mosque at present, notwithstanding the glitter of its gilded pinnacles, is not in a good state of repair, and reflects little credit upon the Musalm\u00e1n population.\nBuddhist and Hindu remains have been discovered in making excavations in the B\u0101la Kila, and there must be still many more there. Several of the fragments found have been placed in the compound of the Institute, and contrast in their elegance with the ugly fountain erected there. Near the fort of the B\u0101la Kila, and south-east of the J\u0101mah Masjid or great mosque, is a smaller and somewhat more ornate mosque, attributed also to S\u0101bit Kh\u0101n, and known as the Moti Masjid. Another memorial of the Naw\u0101b is the tank near the mosque.\n\nAlthough the tomb of Shaikh Jam\u0101l is held in most reverence by the pious, the tomb of Gesu Kh\u0101n is undoubtedly the most beautiful of the mortuary buildings around the town. It is an open pillared chhatri, such as the early Musalm\u0101ns imitated and modified from the Hind\u016bs. Close behind it is an Idg\u0101h bearing an inscription showing that it was built by Gesu Kh\u0101n in 1563 A.D. (page 448). Local tradition makes this personage governor of the town during the reign of Akbar. Altogether there are nearly one hundred im\u0101mbarahs in the town. The Hind\u016bs have many temples, but none of them are of any antiquity or deserving of notice. The temple of Achaleswar, in the southern portion of the city, borders the Achal tank; it is built of kunkur blocks. The tank is of considerable size, and is supplied with tolerably pure water from the Ganges Canal. The temple was a common building until the J\u0101ts came, who presented several valuable gifts to the priests and enlarged the temple. There is a large masonry tank on the Delhi road, built about 200 years ago by J\u0101lu Rai, a Kayasth, which is now in ruins and used as a melon garden.\n\nThe site of the present fort was originally known as R\u0101mgarh, from the village of that name close to it. The oldest inscription as yet discovered connects it with one Muhammad, who was holder of the shikk of Koil under the Lodis in 1524 A.D., and who called it Muhammadgarh after his own name. This name was changed to S\u0101bitgarh at the beginning of the last century (about 1717 A.D.), and to R\u0101mgarh by the J\u0101ts about 1757. Naj\u012bf Kh\u0101n took the fort and changed the name to Aligarh, which it has since retained. Its successive holders, and notably Afr\u0101z\u0101b Kh\u0101n, repaired and strengthened the works in every possible way, and the Marhattas only obtained possession by stratagem. De Boigne and Perron both employed all the military skill available in those days to render the fortress impregnable. Nature itself assisted them. The vicinity of the fort for some distance is interspersed with marshes and shallow pieces of water, which become so much swollen during the rains as to render the place inaccessible, and consequently secure from attack at that season. The outline of the works at the time of the capture by the British was a polygon of probably ten sides, having at each\nangle a bastion, with a renny or fausse-braie, well provided with cannon. Outside this line of defence was a ditch, above 100 feet wide, thirty feet deep from the top of the excavation, and having ten feet of water. Across this ditch was no passage, but by a narrow causeway, defended by a traverse, mounted with three 6-pounders. The result of the attack by the British has already been related. After the capture the fort was insulated by cutting away the causeway and replacing it by a drawbridge; the entrance was strengthened by a ravelin, the ramparts were lowered, a glacis and covered way were added, and the interior was cleared of numerous buildings, which it was thought might interfere with the defence. It was occupied by a few of the rebels for a short time in 1857. The walls and bastions were again repaired in 1858, and barracks for Europeans were built inside, and the trench outside deepened so as to contain seven feet of water in the rains. The fort is now, however, quite unoccupied and garrisoned only by a single watchman under the Public Works Department. There can be no doubt that it could easily be refitted for military purposes, but it is unhealthy. Besides, a force of British soldiers sufficient to garrison the fort should be able to hold their own in the field against any odds, and it is, of course, highly undesirable that it should be occupied by a hostile or insurrectionary army.\n\nThe Koil Min\u00e1r, as we have seen, was erected in 1253 A.D. to commemorate the victories of Sult\u00e1n N\u00e1sir-ud-d\u00edn. A writer in Ledlie\u2019s Miscellany gives an account of the pillar, and winds up with \u201ca hope that the local authorities or the Government may be induced to interpose on behalf of this relic of antiquity. Though vastly inferior to the Kuth Min\u00e1r at Dehli in size and beauty, it is almost equal in historical interest, and deserves to be rescued from the grasp of decay\u2019s effacing fingers.\u201d Alas for his hopes, for in August, 1862, it was pulled down with the sanction of Mr. G. Edmonstone, Lieutenant-Governor, to make room for improvements around the mosque, and for a row of shops which have never yet been let. The Min\u00e1r stood on the high ground of the Bala Kila. It consisted of a round tower on a square base, apparently divided by external cornices into stages, or it may be that balconies were at one time thrown out as in the Dehli pillar. At the time of demolition, the first stage and a part of the second still remained. The base was of block kunkur, with a few pieces of red sandstone; the first stage was entirely of block kunkur, and the second of burned bricks. To the north, a doorway opened on a spiral staircase made of block kunkur which originally led to the top of the column. The staircase was lighted by several apertures, and opened on the balcony at the top of the first stage. The lower stage was 54 feet high, and what remained of the second stage was 20 feet. The external circumference at the base was\n\n---\n\n1 Page 602. 2 Page 486. The inscription is preserved in the Aligarh Institute.\n80 feet, and the walls here were six feet, diminishing at the top of the first stage to four and a half feet. Immediately where the kunkur staircase terminated, there was an ornamental Hind\u00fa pillar laid across the stairway, and above this several beams of wood, which would appear to show that the second stage was built by other hands, and was of comparatively recent origin. It is a little remarkable that the Hind\u00fas of Koil appear to have invented a mythical origin for their pillar, just as those of Dehli did for the Kutb; and as in the Dehli tradition so in that of Koil, the tower was erected at the desire of the pious daughter of the king, who wished to look daily upon the sacred stream of the Jumna or Ganges. The coincidence can hardly be accidental, and we may well admire the ingenuity which thus disguises a badge of defeat and slavery.\n\nThe tomb of Il\u00e1h Baksh stands close to the Moti Masjid. It is small, but handsome and cupola shaped. From the inscription given on a previous (page 489), it would appear to have been built by S\u00e1bit Kh\u00e1n for the fak\u00edr Il\u00e1h Baksh in 1717 A.D. Local tradition says that the tomb was originally built by the Naw\u00e1b for his own remains, but that warned by the fak\u00edr Sh\u00e1h Il\u00e1h Baksh that he should never lie in the tomb that he had built, the Naw\u00e1b defiantly or jestingly replied that either he or the fak\u00edr should lie in it, whichever died first. It so happened that the fak\u00edr did die first, and his heirs claimed the fulfilment of the promise. So his remains were laid in the Naw\u00e1b's sepulchre, whilst S\u00e1bit Kh\u00e1n himself was buried in his own garden now occupied by Kinlochganj.\n\nAbout a quarter of a mile to the west of the J\u00e1mah Masjid, there is a curious group of tombs to the south of the Khair road. The central one, and that which is most venerated by natives, is called the darg\u00e1h of Sh\u00e1h Jam\u00e1l, Shams-ul-Arif\u00edn. The building itself is insignificant, but the surrounding graveyard contains a number of slab tombs and head stones, many of them evidently of considerable antiquity. The inscriptions on a good many are in Arabic. Sh\u00e1h Jam\u00e1l is supposed to have been one of the original invaders of Koil, and the tombs in the neighbourhood probably contain the remains of some of the besiegers. Local tradition makes Jam\u00e1l to be a T\u00e1itar darvesh who took up his abode near Koil previous to the siege and capture by Ala-ud-d\u00edn Ghori. The darvesh predicted the capture, when the assailants were reduced to despair by the long resistance of the town and the sickness that prevailed amongst themselves. Two of Jam\u00e1l's disciples perished in the attack which took place the next day, and in which the town was taken. It is possible that Sh\u00e1h Jam\u00e1l and his disciples were spies of the Ghorian invader, as fak\u00edrs have been both before and since his time. One of his disciples is buried in the M\u00e1mu Bhanja Muhalla in the city, and the other at the tomb called Aulia Ambia; others are buried in the nameless tombs about the city, near\nwhich are some fine tamarind trees. Many of these tombs had endowments, but owing to mismanagement and extravagance and the subdivision of property, the kh\u00e1dims have fallen into poverty and the tombs are now in very bad repair.\n\nPir Bah\u00e1dur was a cavalry commander of some note in Ala-ud-d\u00edn's army, who was killed in the assault on Koil. His remains lie near the (late) Military Hospital, and there used to be a superstition that it was dangerous to gallop a horse in the vicinity of the tomb. In corroboration of this belief, a story is told of the son of a former tahsild\u00e1r of Koil who was thrown from his horse, and, becoming entangled in the stirrup, was dragged along the road till he died, because he galloped close to the tomb. However of late days the station race-course has been established not far from it, without any manifestation of resentment on the part of the Pir.\n\nSh\u00e1h Jam\u00e1l was another chief in the Muslim army whose tomb is not far from the railway station. The villages of Jam\u00e1lpur and Dhorera are still held as a revenue-free grant for the support of the dargah of Sh\u00e1h Jam\u00e1l. The estimated land-revenue of these villages amounts to Rs. 1,440 per annum. An urs (or religious gathering) is held at the tomb of Sh\u00e1h Jam\u00e1l in June, at which about 2,000 persons assemble for worship. In former times the city had several gates, of which the names of the Mad\u00e1r, Dehli, T\u00fcrkman, S\u00e1mi, and Aligarh darw\u00e1zas still survive. Of these, only the vestige of one pillar of the Aligarh gate now remains near the dargah of Kalan Shahid.\n\nI now pass from the city to the precincts occupied by the civil station or Aligarh proper. The station is admirably kept, and consists of a series of private residences and the post-office on one side of a large central space, and on the other the public offices, courts, zila school, the institute building, and the cemetery. The telegraph office is on the south-side of the East Indian Railway, on the outskirts of the city. The old cemetery of 1802 lies towards the fort. There was a military cantonment here until 1870, when the cantonment was abandoned and the lands were handed over to the Koil municipality. Besides the Judge's and the Magistrate's Courts, the principal buildings are as follow:\u2014The Anglo-vernacular school, with an average attendance of 125 boys, of whom 25 are boarders: the latter live in a separate house specially built for them and adjoining the school. The Aligarh Institute and Scientific Society has already been described in the district notice (page 403). The post-office workshops were first started about 32 years ago by Dr. Paton, Postmaster-General, when the custom of carrying mails by the agency of runners was superseded by the innovation of wheeled carriages, mail-carts, and bullock wagons. The experiment was found to be so successful\nthat almost every part of India was supplied from these workshops, not only with carts and wagons, but also with bags, stamps, and other postal apparatus. Soon there arose a colony of workmen, and skilled labour was never wanting in times of emergency. Thus, after the mutiny, as many as 2,000 workmen were employed, and to the workshops is the credit due of the rapidity with which postal communication was re-established at that critical period. Since the opening of the railway the operations of the workshop have been considerably curtailed: at present only between 300 and 400 workmen are employed, consisting of carpenters, iron-smiths, leather-workers, stamp-cutters, &c. The net cost of articles manufactured, exclusive of all profit, is upwards of Rs. 70,000 per annum. The district jail stands to the west of the station: it is built for over 500 prisoners and is usually full.\n\nThe East Indian Railway Station, a well constructed and commodious building, lies between the city and the civil station. The line of the railway here runs in a north-westerly direction, and the traffic between the city and the country lying beyond the civil station passes the railway by level crossings north-west and south-east of the railway station. A junction station for the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway is under construction. There is a small church in the centre of the station, built by Mr. T. P. Woodcock in 1838. Just where the railway passes the jail, at the south-west corner of the jail enclosure, stands a small, plain and indeed ugly, domed monument commemorating the officers who fell in the assault on the Aligarh fort in 1803. Near the premises of the dispensary and the Government Telegraph Office, and also in the grounds of a house in the civil station belonging to Mr. Bramley, C.S., are some old brick tombs, the inscriptions on which have perished. They are certainly not Muhammadan, and most probably mark the burial-place of some of the French residents of M. Perron's time. Mr John P\u00e9che, the last survivor of Perron's companions, died in February, 1872. In Koil there is a dispensary in Russellganj and an important vernacular school known as the \"Madrasah-i-ma'ad-i-khalidik.\"\n\nDr. Whitwell analysed the waters of the civil and military stations, as well as those of the jail and railway station, in August, Drinking water. 1869. He remarked* that the station had been abandoned as a military post owing to the prevalence of fever, and that all the drinking water with one exception was unusually foul, being greatly contaminated by sewage matter, and the water in the well on the railway platform, from its proximity to the latrine and urinal, was particularly unwholesome. The exception was the Ganges Canal water, which appeared to be so free from impurities of any kind that it would be desirable to supply the whole population from it. The physical properties of all the waters examined when passed through filter\n\n* Sixth Report on Analyses of Potable Waters, 1870.\npaper were found to be good, with an alkaline reaction.

Koil was held free of revenue by various grantees. S\u00e1bit Kh\u00e1n, during the reign of Muhammed Sh\u00e1h, resumed many of the grants, but these were again released by Najf Kh\u00e1n. Anand Rao, Desmukh of the Marhattas, in 1785, again resumed all the old holdings, allowing in some cases to the ex-grantees six annas of the produce, and in other\ncases ten annas. Hence the terms shashani and dasani applied to these tenures. Those who appealed to Sindhia were restored to their original holdings, whilst very many accepted the new state of things. Previously to the revision of settlement by Mr. Rose, grants to the yearly value of Rs. 4,500 were resumed by Mr. Harvey, but many of his proceedings were reversed, and Mr. G. Blunt assessed the town at only Rs. 5,272. Hitherto the sums due to the grantees were paid from the Government Treasury; but Mr. Blunt placed farmers in possession, confirming Government as landholder. The town was then divided into four mah\u00e1ls or estates,\u2014the Dehli Darw\u00e1za, Budaun Darw\u00e1za, M\u00edthi Kirki, and Khari Kirki, and the revenue was distributed in the following manner:\n\n| Area in acres | Assumed rent. | Grantees' allowance. | Residue for the State. | Collection fees to farmer. | Net result |\n|---------------|--------------|----------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|------------|\n| 1,786         | Rs. 7,217    | Rs. 1,945            | Rs. 5,272              | Rs. 59                    | Rs. 4,743   |\n\nThis state of things lasted until after the mutiny. A complete change was then effected. \"The city was conspicuous for its disloyalty, and many of the residents and ex-mu\u00e1fid\u00e1rs were found deserving of punishment. Of the ten farmers, eight were Muhammadans and two Hind\u00fas. No charge was made against the latter; of the former, one was an absconded rebel, and a son of another had been killed in action with our troops. The Muhammadans indeed had been notoriously refractory, and Mr. Bramley, the Collector, wrote:\u2014 'Against the others, if no overt act can be proved, still the fact of their disaffection has been sufficiently obvious.' He then went on to recommend the immediate transfer of the farm held by the Muhammadans to Raja Gobind Singh of H\u00e1thras, who had specially distinguished himself by his good services in behalf of order, leaving the share of the Hind\u00fas in their possession for the time, but proposing that it also should be conferred on the Raja on the expiry of the term of settlement in 1868. Not only was this proposal, as far as it went, sanctioned by the Governor-General, but, in addition, the zamind\u00e1ri rights of Government in the city were conferred on the Raja and his heirs for ever by a sanad dated 5th June, 1866.\"\n\nThe gift was not a valuable one, as it merely placed Gobind Singh in the position of the farmers, whilst the same allowances were paid to Government. At the recent settlement the names and arrangements of the mah\u00e1ls were altered. There are now five pattis or subdivisions forming one mah\u00e1l, viz., (1) R\u00e1ni S\u00e1hib Kunwar, including the former revenue-paying land and the revenue-free land\u2014which has come into the possession of Gobind Singh and his heirs; (2)\nPatti Mu\u00e1fi Muzabta, comprising all the resumed revenue-free lands in the possession of the original grantees and assessed at half assets; (3) Patti Mu\u00e1fiat comprises all revenue-free land a portion or all of which is cultivated; and (4) Patti Ab\u00e1di includes sites of houses, bungalows, and land taken up for public purposes.\\(^1\\) The statistics of each patti are as follows:\n\n| Name of patti. | Total acres. | Barren. | Waste. | Cultivated. | Land-revenue. | Cases. | Fees of lumbermen. | Total. |\n|----------------|--------------|---------|--------|-------------|---------------|--------|-------------------|-------|\n|                | Acres.       | Acres.  | Acres. | Acres.      | Rs.           | Rs.    | Rs.               | Rs.   |\n| 1.

Henderson in 1823. The same gentleman made considerable improvements in the manufacture of cotton, indigo, and fine gunpowder. He also founded the Agra United Service Bank and established the *Agra Ukht\u00e1*, under the editorship of Mr. Harry Tandy, who died in Aligarh in 1842. The chief trade is in cotton, for which there are screws near the railway station, and about 8,434 bales of cotton, weighing 31,154 maunds, were exported by the East Indian Railway alone in 1872. The indigo manufacture is altogether in the district; there are no factories allowed in the town. The affairs of the town are managed by a municipality, numbering fifteen members, of whom five are official and ten are elected by the tax-payers. The income is raised by an octroi tax on imports, which in 1872-73 fell at a rate of Re. 0-11-6 per head of the population. The following table shows the income and expenditure for a series of years, and\n\n\\(^1\\) See further regarding this settlement in Smith's report, 114.\nthe succeeding table shows the net imports in quantity or value for the year 1872-73:\n\n| Articles | Net imports in quantity | Net imports in value | Consumption per head |\n|----------|------------------------|----------------------|---------------------|\n| Grain of sorts | 367,478 | 7,74,530 | 7 0 13 |\n| Rice and khil | 18,560 | 37,677 | 9 9 2 |\n| Sugar, refined | 16,745 | 3,00,928 | 0 12 2 |\n| Ditto, coarse | 70,112 | 2,79,786 | 1 10 12 |\n| Ghi | 7,085 | 1,41,708 | ... |\n| Fruits and sugar-cane | 7,228 | 1,49,784 | ... |\n| Noodles | 66,169 | 21,906 | ... |\n| Vegetables and milk | 19,540 | 40,876 | ... |\n| Oil | 6,409 | 51,907 | 0 4 11 |\n| Wax | 79 | 1,579 | ... |\n| Oil-seeds | 30,818 | 60,635 | 0 21 15 |\n| Fuel | 176,585 | 44,998 | ... |\n| Soap-nuts, soap, &c., | 24,397 | 1,646 | ... |\n| Building materials | 72,616 | 46,096 | ... |\n| Iron | 1,170 | 14,741 | ... |\n| String, bamboos, &c. | 22,550 | 30,250 | ... |\n| Drugs, spices, &c. | 14,888 | 58,834 | ... |\n| Tobacco | 2,974 | 3,915 | ... |\n| Cloth | 6,37,360 | 11 6 94 |\n| Metals | 1,635 | 49,132 | 0 14 2 |\n\nTotal | 46,710 | 47,161 | 45,378 |\nFrom Aligarh military routes branch off by S\u00e1\u0161ni and H\u00e1thras to Agra (distant 53\u00bd miles, or five marches); by Jal\u00e1li and K\u00e1s- ganj to Budaun (distant 73 miles, or 7 marches); by Jawa and An\u00fapshahr to Budaon (distant 96\u00bd miles, or 8 marches); by Somna and Kh\u00farja to Dehli (distant 80\u00bd miles, or 7 marches); by Jawa and An\u00fap- shahr to Moradabad (distant 80\u00bd miles, or 8 marches); by Somna and Buland- shahr to Moradabad (distant 110 miles, or 10 marches), and by Igl\u00e1s to Muttra (distant 38\u00bd miles, or 3 marches). Each of the stages will be found noticed in the district alphabetical arrangement under the names of the towns or halting-places where they occur.\n\nAtrauli, the chief town of the parganah and tahsili of the same name in the Aligarh district, is distant 16 miles from Koil on the R\u00e1mghat road.\n\nIn 1847 Atrauli had 12,722 inhabitants; in 1853 the population numbered 15,410; in 1858, 14,329; and in 1865 there were 15,052 inhabitants. The site has an area of 163 square acres, giving 98 souls to the acre. According to the census of 1872 there were 15,941 inhabitants, of whom 9,829 were Hind\u00fas (4,643 females), and 6,112 were Musalm\u00e1ns (3,059 females). Distributing the population amongst the rural and urban classes, the returns show 483 landholders, 2,070 cultivators, and 13,388 persons pursuing occupations unconnected with agriculture. The number of enclosures in 1872 was 2,020, of which 761 were occupied by Mu- salm\u00e1ns. The number of houses during the same year was 3,419, of which 960 were built with skilled labour, and of these 283 were occupied by Musalm\u00e1ns. Of the 2,459 mud huts in the town, 1,021 were owned by the same religionists. Taking the male adult population, 4,985 (not less than fifteen years of age), we find the following occupations pursued by more than fifty males:\u2014Barbers, 90; beggars, 142; bullock-dealers, 73; butchers, 60; calico-printers, 90; confectioners, 64; flower-sellers, 212; goldsmiths, 81; labourers, 853; mer- chants, 134; money-lenders, 69; pandits, 59; petty dealers, 75; potters, 55; servants, 530; shepherds, 99; sweepers, 66; water-carriers, 113; and weavers, 502.\n\nThe town is well built, clean and healthy, and the principal ways are fairly wide, well-drained, and metalled. A good road runs under Atrauli to R\u00e1mghat on the Ganges. The K\u00e1li is crossed by a fine well-built masonry bridge at the extremity of the Ukhl\u00e1na boundary on this road. The three ways of entrance to the town from the Aligarh road converge on the market-place in the centre of the town, and from it two bazarways branch off to the east, and then to the south known as the Mandi and Bara baz\u00e1rs. In the southern border of the town, these two bazar- ways join by a curving road, so that the business portion of the town forms an oval, well-metalled and drained throughout. The Bara bazar is the more\nimportant of the two, and has a fair trade in cotton, iron, brass utensils, and country produce. The Mandi bazar-houses are poor, and many are in a ruinous state. The southern portion of the town is chiefly inhabited by agriculturists and Cham\u00e1rs, who cultivate the rich lands in the vicinity. The water in wells is found at a depth of 20 feet from the surface, and is good as a rule, though occasionally brackish. There is no canal irrigation near, and drainage could easily be effected to the K\u00e1l\u00ed, distant 2\u00bd miles to the west. There is a tahsili, police-station, post-office, and a school here. The tahsili is on a high-raised site in the centre of the town formerly occupied by a fort. It consists of a group of buildings surrounded by a high wall, and communicates by a metalled road, planted with trees, with the market-place below. The sar\u00e1i lies in the centre of the town between the two baz\u00e1srs. The school is a church-like building, with many windows; it is of faulty construction and but badly attended, as the Musalm\u00e1ns have many private schools at which Persian and the reading of the Kor\u00e1n is taught.\n\nAtrauli has had municipal government since 1865. The committee now consists of nine members, of whom three are official, three are elected by the tax-payers, and three are nominated by the Collector. There is very little trade, and no manufacture of any importance.

I have only found it mentioned once in the Persian stories as the halting-place of Mul\u00e1r\u00e1k Sh\u00e1h's forces in 1426 A.D., in his contest with the Jaunpur Sultan.\u00b9 The Musalm\u00e1n inhabitants have always had a bad reputation. From June until the early part of September, 1857, they remained in possession of the town. They are converted Hind\u00fas, and from the first showed disaffection to the British rule. Early in September, Mr. Cocks, the Special Commissioner, sent Muhammad Ali, a devoted servant of Government, as Joint Magistrate to Atrauli, with Da\u00fad Kh\u00e1n as his deputy. But the Musalm\u00e1ns refused to acknowledge his authority, and on the 25th September they broke out into open rebellion and murdered Muhammad Ali on his leaving the tahsil. On the restoration of order several of the more prominent leaders of rebellion suffered punishment.\n\n\u00b9Dowson's Elliot, IV., 63.\n\nAtrauli, a parganah in the tahsil of the same name in the Aligarh district, is bounded on the north by the Bulandshahr district; on the east by pargana Gang\u00edri; on the south by parganahs Koil and Gang\u00edri; and on the west by parganahs Morthal and Koil. In 1874 the area comprised 106,022 acres, of which 70,727 acres were cultivated (40,590 irrigated),\n16,669 acres were culturable, 20,464 acres were barren, and 162 acres were held free of revenue.\n\nThe eastern portions of parganah Atrauli as it stood before 1870, viz., those estates which immediately adjoin the low ground in the old bed of the Ganges (or Burhganga) are of the worst description, containing for the most part a large portion of sandy and unirrigated land. The lowlands themselves are not of large extent, but their produce, especially where the soil is suited to sugar-cane, or to the double crop of wheat and rice, is exceedingly sure and abundant. The villages on the extreme western boundary are chiefly of inferior quality, while the remainder of the parganah is on the whole comparatively good. This parganah is traversed by three streams, of which the K\u00e1li Nadi skirts the western boundary, whilst the Chohiya and Nim Nadis enter the parganah at different points, and, after uniting at the village of Ramam\u00e1i, flow out in a southerly direction. These two last streams do not add much to the fertility of the parganah, for their overflow in the rainy season seems rather to deteriorate than to improve the soil, while they dry up so soon as to be of little use, except below the junction, for the purpose of irrigation. The K\u00e1li Nadi, on the other hand, retains its water through the year, and wheat is consequently raised in most places on its banks. But the lands through which it flows are not commonly of a superior kind, and they have moreover suffered much of late years by the exudation of reh, which has caused much of them to remain out of cultivation.\n\nThe changes in area since the last settlement have been considerable, and are noted hereafter. The former settlement in taluka Bhamauri N\u00e1h took 62 per cent. of the assets; in Datauli 65 per cent. was taken; in Faizpur Badariya, 66 per cent.; and in Atrauli Kh\u00e1s, Morthal, Akribad, and Jal\u00e1l\u00ed, 70 per cent. was taken. The new assessment is at half assets.\u00b9 The following statement gives the statistics of the present settlement of the assessable area:\n\n| Cultivable | Cultivated |\n|------------|------------|\n| New allot. | Old waste. | Groves. | Total | Irrigated | Dry | Total |\n| Acres.     | Acres.     | Acres.   | Acres. | Acres.     | Acres. | Acres. | Acres. |\n| 2,063      | 14,019     | 597      | 16,669 | 40,590     | 30,137 | 70,727 | 87,996 |\n\nThe proportion of culturable land to the total area is 81 per cent., and the proportion of cultivation to the culturable area is the same. The proportion of irrigated area to cultivated area is 57. The character of the culturable waste\n\n\u00b9 See detailed observations on new assessment in Revenue Reporter, IV., 67.\nis of three kinds\u2014dh\u00e9k jungle, bh\u00e1r or sand, and the lowlying lands in the river bed. The first does not abound; as to the second, which lies chiefly about the N\u00eem and above the Ganges, much of it is covered with k\u00eene grass, and can only be cultivated at intervals of from two to four years. The settlement of five villages lying within the river-bed has been made for only five years; as the land within their area is seldom used except for grazing purposes, and is subject to injury from reh, and even if cultivation would pay, the habits of the Ahars and Aheriyas who inhabit these tracts are little favourable to a settled life. The land-revenue assessed at the recent settlement amounts to Rs. 1,47,275, and the cesses to Rs. 14,635, falling at a rate of Re. 1-5-10 per British acre on the total area, at Re. 1-11-0 per acre on the area assessed to Government revenue, and at Rs. 2-1-3 per acre on the cultivated area. The sum paid by cultivators to the landowners as rent and cesses during the year 1871 has been estimated at Rs. 2,64,023.\n\nTalukas Bhamauri N\u00e2h, Datauli, Chak\u00e1thal, Raipur, Lohgarh, Sanaul, and Badesara are mentioned in the district notice. Taking this parganah and Gangiri together, though two-thirds belong to the talukad\u00e2rs of Bhamauri N\u00e2h and Datauli, the transfers during the currency of the expired settlement have been considerable. Out of a total of 6,120 shares into which the estates in both parganahs had been divided, 3,928 shares changed hands between 1838 and 1868. Many of these shares were transferred several times, and the net result is that 2,970 shares, comprising one-half of the old parganah of Atrauli and one-third of the old parganah of Gangiri, have been permanently lost to the old proprietors. Much of these changes must be attributed to the severity of the assessment. The following table shows the mode of transfer, the area, revenue and average price per acre of transfers made during each decade of the expired settlement:\n\n| Mode of transfer | Area | Price | Average per acre | Area | Price | Average per acre | Area | Price | Average per acre |\n|------------------|------|-------|------------------|------|-------|------------------|------|-------|------------------|\n|                  | Acres | Rs. | Rs. a. p. | Acres | Rs. | Rs. a. p. | Acres | Rs. | Rs. a. p. |\n| Private sale ... | 13,412 | 93,964 | 7 2 7 | 13,730 | 1,41,800 | 11 9 4 | 10,706 | 1,51,008 | 14 1 8 |\n| Mortgage ...     | 15,041 | 88,992 | 5 18 0 | 7,050 | 37,985 | 5 6 2 | 7,051 | 75,570 | 10 11 5 |\n| Auction sale ... | 26,508 | 1,80,644 | 6 13 0 | 4,614 | 56,988 | 12 2 0 | 6,687 | 64,037 | 8 1 11 |\n| Total ...        | 55,001 | 3,64,900 | ... | 24,384 | 2,36,778 | ... | 24,414 | 2,80,635 | ... |\n\nThe average value for the whole 29 years in both parganahs is roughly seven years' purchase of the land-revenue. In the old parganah of Atrauli the price has risen from 5\u00b79 years' purchase in the first decade to 9\u00b72 years' purchase in\nthe last nine years, and in the old parganah of Gangirif rom 2\u00b78 years' purchase in the first decade to 6\u00b78 years' purchase in the last nine years. The soil in the latter tract is inferior to that in the former, and consists of a continuation or part of the Atrauli sandy tract. Hereditary tenants held, in the whole tahsil in 1868, 4,134 holdings, comprising 34,448 acres, or 23 per cent. of the cultivated area; tenants-at-will held 9,900 holdings, comprising 98,823 acres, or 62 per cent. of the same area; and the seer of proprietors comprised 978 holdings, equal to 22,222 acres, or 15 per cent. of the cultivation. Their holdings averaged respectively 8 acree, 9\u00b75 acres, and 23 acres. In 1867-68 hereditary cultivators paid an average rental of Rs. 3\u00b77\u00b72 per acre, whilst tenants-at-will paid Rs. 3\u00b714\u00b78 per acre, a rate Rs. 13\u00b75\u00b70 per cent. higher than that paid by tenants with a right of occupancy. Comparing the statistics of 165 villages for which records from the last settlement exist, the statistics of the holdings of hereditary tenants in 1838 and 1868 are as follows:\n\n| Year | Area | Number of holdings | Average area |\n|------|------|--------------------|--------------|\n| 1838 | ...  | 22,306             | 2,591        |\n|      | Acres.|                    |              |\n| 1868 | ...  | 18,755             | 2,349        |\n|      | Acres.|                    |              |\n\nThis shows a diminution of 14 per cent in the number of holdings and of 16 per cent. in the area held by hereditary cultivators\u2014a result seldom met with elsewhere, and only to be accounted for by the disinclination of the Bhikampur talukadars and the new Baniya landowners to permit the growth of occupancy rights. One-third of the area in both parganahs is leased on rents in kind. This system is, however, almost entirely confined to the sandy tracts along the Ganges and Kali, cultivated by the notoriously unthrifty Ahirs and Ahriyas\u2014the first devoted to breeding and grazing cattle, and not seldom stealing them, and the latter lazy and worthless as cultivators.\n\nAccording to the census of 1872 parganah Atrauli contained 161 inhabited villages, of which 50 had less than 200 inhabitants; 71 had between 200 and 500; 28 had between 500 and 1,000; 10 had between 1,000 and 2,000; and one had between 2,000 and 3,000. The only town containing more than 5,000 inhabitants is Atrauli, with 15,941. The settlement records show that there are 203 mahals or estates in the parganah.\n\nThe total population in 1872 numbered 80,647 souls (37,764 females), giving 477 to the square mile. Classified according to religion, there were 70,128 Hindus, of whom 32,580 were females; 10,519 Musalmans, amongst whom 5,184 were females. Distributing the Hindu population amongst the four great classes, the census shows 9,040 Brahmans, of whom 4,088 were females; 2,393 Rajputs, including 1,041 females; 3,011 Banias (1,422 females); whilst the great mass of the population is included in \"the other castes\" of the census returns, which show a total of 26,029 souls, of whom 29,655 are females.\nThe principal Brahman subdivisions found in this parganah are the Gaur (608), Saraswat (426), and Sanadh (243). The Rajputs chiefly belong to the Chauhan (686), Badgujar (1,157), Gahlot, Jadon, Janghara, Tomar, Pundir, Panwar, Mandwar, and Bais clans. The Baniyas are of the Agarwal (394), Ohansaina, Dasa, Ghoi, Jaisawal, Rastagi, Sarangi, and Badpeta subdivisions. Amongst the other castes the following have more than 1,000 members:\u2014Barhai (1,568), Hajjam (1,471), Ahir (1,847), Kahar (2640), Koli (2,895), Cham\u00e1r (11,069), Khattik (1,640), Khakrob (1,614), Garariya (3,017), and Lodha (12,538). The following have less than 1,000 and more than 100 members:\u2014Jat, Sonar, Mali, Bh\u00e1t, Kal\u00e1l, Goshain, Kachhi, Darzi, Jogi, Bairagi, Dhobi, Lohar, Kumhar, Aheriya, Banjara, Kayath, Dhuna, Mallah, Teli, and Chhipi. The Musalmans are distributed amongst Shaikhs (1,717), Sayyids (391), Pathans (1,471), and Mughals (142). The remainder are unspecified.\n\nThe occupations of the people are shown in the statistics collected at the census of 1872. From these it appears that of the male adult population (not less than fifteen years of age), 285 are employed in professional avocations, such as Government servants, priests, doctors, and the like; 2,378 in domestic service, as personal servants, water-carriers, barbers, sweepers, washermen, &c.; 1,069 in commerce, in buying, selling, keeping or lending money or goods, or the conveyance of men, animals, or goods; 12,767 in agricultural operations; 4,803 in industrial occupations, arts, and mechanics, and the preparation of all classes of substances vegetable, mineral, and animal. There were 4,468 persons returned as labourers, and 560 as of no specified occupation. Taking the total population, irrespective of age or sex, the same returns give 2,043 as landholders, 36,770 as cultivators, and 41,834 as engaged in occupations unconnected with agriculture. The educational statistics, which are confessedly imperfect, show 1,623 males as able to read and write out of a total male population numbering 42,883 souls.\n\nSince 1838 constant changes have taken place in the area of this parganah; thus from 1848 the following alterations may be noted:\n\n| Year | Number of Villages | Transferred to | Area in acres | Land Revenue |\n|------|--------------------|----------------|---------------|--------------|\n|      |                    |                |               |              |\n| 1848 | 1                  | Bulandshahr    | 576           | Rs.          |\n|      |                    | Mortal         | 940           | 1,851        |\n| 1854 | 3                  | Gangiri        | 2,921         | 1,728        |\n| Total| 5                  |                | 3,752         | 3,460        |\n| Increase| 62                |                | 47,001        | 54,356       |\n\n| Year | Number of Villages | Received from | Area | Land Revenue |\n|------|--------------------|---------------|------|--------------|\n|      |                    |               |      |              |\n| 1848 | 2                  | Mortal        | 1,612 | 1,456        |\n|      |                    | Fairpur       | 6,617 | 6,678        |\n| 1854 | 14                 | Jalalpur      | 22,677 | 21,454       |\n|      |                    | Akrahad       | 19,947 | 28,158       |\n| Total| 67                 |               | 50,758 | 57,736       |\nIn 1873 further changes were sanctioned which resulted in the addition of 91,252 acres to Gangtiri; at the same time four villages were transferred from Gangtiri to Morthal and two were received from Morthal.\n\nAtrauli, a tahsil of the Aligarh district, comprises the parganahs of Atrauli and Gangtiri. The total area according to the settlement records of 1874 contains 226,371 acres, of which 478 acres are held free of revenue and 35,286 acres are barren. Of the remaining assessable area (190,607 acres) 150,305 acres are cultivated, and of these 73,406 acres are irrigated. Of the culturable area (40,302 acres) 1,663 acres are under groves, 33,547 acres are old culturable waste, and 5,092 acres are new fallow. The new land-revenue assessed on the parganah amounts to Rs. 2,92,184, and the cesses to Rs. 29,218. The revenue falls at a rate of Re. 1-15-1 on the cultivated acre. In 1872 the population numbered 157,374 souls (73,595 females), giving 445 souls to the square mile, distributed amongst 294 inhabited villages. The agricultural population numbers 80,371 souls, and possess 1-8 acre per head and 9 acres per family. There are altogether 306 villages, with an average area of 739 acres, and ranging from 3,907 acres to 47 acres. The same statistics show 447 persons as blind, 34 lepers, 28 deaf and dumb, 8 idiots, and 15 insane persons in the tahsil in 1872.\n\nThe Nim Nadi runs through the centre of Atrauli and the southern portion of Gangtiri, and the Chhoiya joins the Nim in the centre of Atrauli. These streams are dry except during the rains. The Kali affords some irrigation throughout the year, but owing to the efflorescence of reh, that which is cultivated one year may be barren the next, and here reh was known before the introduction of the canal and cannot be attributed to its action. The physical conformation of the tahsil is similar to that of other tracts throughout the Duab. First are the lowlands of the Ganges comprising the old bed of the river to the extreme east. Next come the uplands known as the bingar or padra, which rise sharply from the lowlands and for some distance contain light and sandy soil. This soil is gradually exchanged for a clay and loam as one proceeds westward, and these soils are characteristic of the central portions of the tahsil. Here and there extensive dair plains occur. Further west and near the Kali comes a second long strip of sand, but of much less extent than the similar tract near the Ganges, and then we have the tardi or lowlands of the Kali itself. Though so much of the old area has been permanently alienated between 1839 and 1868, the increased value of land and improvement in prices must conduce to put a stop to these transfers, and one ought not to hear much of them in future. The culturable area of the whole tahsil is 84 per cent. of the total area; cultivation covers 79 per cent. of the culturable area, but irrigation only reaches 49 per cent. of the cultivation, and of the culturable waste one per cent. is under groves.\n\nG. O. No. 182, dated February 7, 1870.\nThere is a less proportion of irrigation and a greater of unirrigated sandy soil here than in any other subdivision of the district.\n\nUnirrigated bh\u0101r and piliya occupy 82 per cent., or one-third, and irrigated and unirrigated bh\u0101r and piliya together 46 per cent., or nearly one-half the entire cultivated area. B\u0101rah and manjha comprise only nine per cent. of the cultivated area. The crops too are inferior. There is more barley (18 per cent.) and less wheat (18 per cent.), more b\u0101jra (16 per cent.) and other inferior rain-crops than elsewhere. The cold-weather crops are 48\u00b75 per cent. of the whole crops. The old rate on cultivation amounted to Re. 1-13-3 per acre; and is now Re. 1-15-1 per acre. The increase in revenue on the two parganahs amounts to 18 per cent. on the old revenue of Rs. 2,47,136. The general result of the new revision is that enhancement of the Government demand has taken place in 79 per cent. of the villages and 83 per cent. of the former revenue: in 4 per cent. of the villages and 2 per cent. of the revenue the assessment remains as it was before, and in the remainder reductions have taken place. These last comprise the sandy villages (8) east of the Nim, and on the high lands above the Ganges and the villages (19) lying in the kh\u0101dir of the Ganges. The kh\u0101dir villages are generally thickly studded with patches of reh, and if cultivated will only give the poorest crops. In twelve of them the settlement has been made for five years only, and will then be revised, as, owing to the scanty cultivation at present existing, it was found impossible to assess them for a longer term. The soils here were divided into three classes\u2014(1) kh\u0101dir b\u0101rah and manjha, with an average rental of Rs. 5-4-3 per acre; (2) first-class outlying kh\u0101dir or sugar-cane land, with an average rental of Rs. 7-14-5 per acre; and (3) second-class outlying kh\u0101dir, with an average rental of Rs. 2-10-2 per acre.\n\nBarauli, a village in parganah Barauli and tahsil Koil of the Aligarh district, is distant 13 miles from Aligarh. The population in 1865 numbered 2,274 souls, and in 1872 there were 2,523 inhabitants, chiefly Badg\u016bjars. The Chaukid\u0101ri Act (XX. of 1856) is in force in Barauli, and in 1873 supported a village police numbering four men of all grades at an annual cost of Rs. 234. The number of the houses in the town in 1872-3 was 469, and of those 348 were assessed with a house-tax averaging Re. 1-0-5 per house and Re. 0-2-3 per head of the population per annum. The income for the same year was Rs. 458, including a balance of Rs. 99 from the previous year, and the expenditure was Rs. 385.\n\nBarauli is a small taluka, now called a parganah, lying to the extreme north of the Aligarh district. It is bounded on the north-east and north-west by the Bulandshahr district, and on the south by parganahs Koil and Khair of the Aligarh district. The census of 1872 shows that it had then a total area of 25 square miles and 617 acres, of which 15 square miles and 603 acres were under\ncultivation. The area assessed to Government revenue during the same year was 17 square miles and 62 acres, of which 2 square miles and 19 acres were culturable, and the remainder was cultivated.\n\nThere is nothing peculiar in the physical appearance of this tract, and the history of the Badg\u00fajar family who own it is given in the district notice (page 445). Mr. Rose made the assessment in 1838. There was then 52 per cent. of irrigation, and the rate on cultivation fell at Rs. 1-10-5 per acre. The present settlement was made by Mr. W. H. Smith, and the statistics of area are as follows:\n\n| Settlement | Unassessable | Cultivable | Cultivated |\n|------------|--------------|------------|------------|\n|            |              |            |            |\n|            | Acres        | Acres      | Acres      |\n| Former     | 4,680        | 346        | In correct |\n| Present    | 5,121        | ...        | 1,265      |\n\nThe proportion of the culturable to the total area is only 69 per cent., but the proportion of cultivation to the culturable area is 89, and of irrigation to cultivated area is 60, showing an increase of 22 per cent. The new assessment amounts to Rs. 20,590, and the cesses to Rs. 2,059. The increase in the revenue has therefore been 27 per cent. There have been very few changes in the proprietary possession of the soil since 1838. The alienations have chiefly been temporary through mortgage, and these incumbrances are now being paid off. The returns show that in 12 out of the 25 villages in the parganah 9,153 acres, out of a total of 16,074 acres, have been transferred, but the greater portion of these transfers are only temporary by mortgage. The following statement shows the particulars of the transfers made between 1838 and 1868; 24 out of the 25 villages in the parganah still belong to one owner:\n\n| Mode of transfer | 1839-1848 | 1849-1858 | 1859-1868 |\n|------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n|                  | Acres     | Rs. a. p. | Acres     | Rs. a. p. | Acres     | Rs. a. p. |\n| Private sale     | 815       | 12 14 1   | 11 0      |           | 65        | 21 3 6   |\n| Mortgage         | 3,640     | 8 12 9    | 9 8 10    | 8 7       | 104       | 8 13 2   |\n| Auction sale     |           |           |           |           | 3         | 21 9 2   |\n| Total            | 4,455     | 7 1 5     | 3 7       | 330       | 9 8 10    | 8 7      |\n|                  |           |           |           |           | 178       | 13 4 11   |\n|                  |           |           |           |           |           | 11 9     |\nMortgages form the great bulk of the transfers in this parganah. Mr. Rose, in his report on the assessment in 1838, remarks that \"the present managers are deeply in debt, and it is not probable that the property will in a few years pass out of their possession; and, so far as the prosperity of the cultivating community and the interest of the State are concerned, the sooner such a change takes place the better.\" These expectations have not been realised; the proprietor of the day, though still in debt, is in possession. Few sales have taken place and the mortgages are being gradually reduced, whilst the general rise in the value of land will probably enable him to clear off all his present incumbrances. There have been no farms or sales on account of arrears of the land-revenue between 1833 and 1868 in this parganah, and the present easy assessment can without difficulty be paid from the assets. In Barauli, in 1857, hereditary tenants paid an average rental of Rs. 1-12-5; this had increased in 1868 to Rs. 2-14-5; tenants-at-will, in 1857, paid on an average Rs. 2-13-8 per acre, and this has been increased by 37-2 per cent., or to Rs 3-14-8 per acre. The land-revenue for 1872 amounted to Rs. 20,590 (or with cesses Rs. 22,549), falling at a rate of Re. 1-8-10 per British acre on the total area, at Re. 1-2-6 per acre on the area assessed to Government revenue, and at Rs. 2-0-2 per acre on the cultivated area.\n\nAccording to the census of 1872 parganah Barauli contained 24 inhabited villages, of which 6 had less than 200 inhabitants; 15 had between 200 and 500; 2 had between 500 and 1,000; and one had between 2,000 and 3,000. The settlement records show altogether 25 villages distributed amongst mahals or estates. The total population in 1872 numbered 9,652 souls (4,535 females), giving 445 to the square mile. Classified according to religion, there were 8,591 Hind\u00fas, of whom 4,033 were females, and 1,061 Musalm\u00e1ns, amongst whom 502 were females. Distributing the Hind\u00fa population amongst the four great classes, the census shows 1,631 Brahmans, of whom 749 were females; 1,433 Rajp\u00fats, including 617 females; 406 Baniyas (200 females); whilst the great mass of the population is included in \"the other castes\" of the census returns, which show a total of 5,121 souls, of whom 2,467 are females. The principal Brahman subdivisions found in this parganah are the Gaur (249) and Saraswat (43). The Rajp\u00fats belong chiefly to the Chah\u00e1n (118), J\u00e1don (1,223), Gahlot, Badg\u00fajar, and Jangh\u00e1ra clans. The Baniyas comprise Agarw\u00e1ls (263), D\u00e1sas, Chaunainis, and Mah\u00e9ris. Amongst the other castes the only one that has more than one thousand members is the Cham\u00e1r (1,442). The following have more than one hundred and less than one thousand members each:\u2014J\u00e1t, Barhai, Hajj\u00e1m, Kah\u00e1r, Jogi, Koli, Khatik, Kh\u00e1krob, Kumh\u00e1r, and Garariya. The Musalm\u00e1ns comprise Shaikhs (577) and Mew\u00e1tis (450).\nThe occupations of the people are shown in the statistics collected at the census of 1872. From these it appears that of the male adult population (not less than fifteen years of age) 25 are employed in professional avocations, such as Government servants, priests, doctors, and the like; 385 in domestic service, as personal servants, water-carriers, barbers, sweepers, washermen, &c.; 61 in commerce, in buying, selling, keeping or lending money or goods, or the conveyance of men, animals, or goods; 1,490 in agricultural operations; 456 in industrial occupations, arts and mechanics, and the preparation of all classes of substances, vegetable, mineral, and animal. There were 519 persons returned as labourers and 94 as of no specified occupation. Taking the total population, irrespective of age or sex, the same returns give 104 as landholders, 4,342 as cultivators, and 5,206 as engaged in occupations unconnected with agriculture. The educational statistics, which are confessedly imperfect, show 210 males as able to read and write out of a total male population numbering 5,117 souls.\n\nBarauli is in reality a taluka still held almost intact by Badgujara. It belonged to the old parganah of Koil, and was not detached from it until the last century; for all practical purposes it is now regarded as one with taluka Morthal under the name of parganah Morthal (see MORTHAL). In 1854, 17 villages were transferred from Barauli to parganah Pahasa in the Bulandshahr district.\u00b9\n\nBeswan, a village in parganah Gorai and tahsil Iglas of the Aligarh district, is distant 26 miles from Aligarh and 4 miles from Jewar. The population in 1865 was 8,253, and in 1872 there were 3,541 inhabitants, chiefly Jats. Beswan gives its name to a taluka, an account of which has been given in the district notice under the head of \"old families.\" The Chaukidari Act (XX. of 1856) is in force in the village, and in 1873 supported a village police numbering seven men of all grades, at an annual cost of Rs. 396. The number of the houses in the town in 1872-78 was 826, and of those 695 were assessed with a house-tax averaging Re. 0-13-10 per house and Re. 0-2-9 per head of the population per annum. The income for the same year was Rs. 666, including a balance of Rs. 64 from the previous year, and the expenditure was Rs. 629.\n\nBijai Garh, or Gambhir as it is often called, a town in parganah Akabad and tahsil Sikandra Rao of the Aligarh district, is 12 miles from Aligarh and 10 miles from Sikandra. The population in 1858 numbered 4,449 souls, and in 1865 there were 4,798 inhabitants. In 1872 there were 5,652 inhabitants, of whom 5,228 were Hind\u00fas (2,359 females) and 424 were Musalm\u00e1ns (197 females). The town site occupies 41 square acres, giving 138 souls to the acre. A fair kuchcha road runs from Iglas by S\u00e1ni, and passing the fort of Bijai-garh joins the Grand Trunk Road above Akabad. The neighbourhood is\n\n\u00b9 G. O. No. 1159, dated March 8, 1854.\nirrigated from a r\u00e9jbaha of the Ganges Canal. There is a watchman's post, a school, and a post-office here. The town is purely an agricultural one, but rapidly advancing in prosperity. The Chaukid\u00e1ri Act (XX. of 1856) is in force in Bijaigarh, and in 1873 supported a village police numbering nine men of all grades at an annual cost of Rs. 516. The number of the houses in the town in 1872-73 was 968, and of these 795 were assessed with a house-tax averaging Re. 1-1-2 per house and Re. 0-2-5 per head of the population per annum. The income for the same year was Rs. 856, including a balance of Re. 0-8-11 from the previous year, and the expenditure was Rs. 729.\n\nBijaigarh was held by Bhagwant Singh in 1803, and was not taken without some trouble. There is a monument here to Colonel Gordon, who was killed by the accidental explosion of a tumbril after the fort had been taken. The neighbouring fort of Kachaura was held by Th\u00e1kur Harkishan Singh of Besw\u00e1n, and in the attack Major Nairn, of the 2nd Cavalry, lost his life. The slab erected to his memory was in 1853 removed to Bhadw\u00e1s, on the Grand Trunk Road between Eta and Aligarh. The graves of those who fell at Bijaigarh are in the low d\u016bhar lands below the fort, and those who fell at Kachaura are buried in Loh\u00e1r-ke-Nagla.\n\nChandaus, a town in parganah Chandaus and tahsil Khair of the Aligarh district, lies in latitude 28\u00b0-5'-2\" and longitude 77\u00b0-54'-7\", at an elevation of 699-3 feet above the level of the sea. The upper markstone of the Great Trigonometrical Survey station is on a high bank of accumulated sand about 400 yards from the village of that name. The village of Umri lies to the south-west of the station 5-9 miles, and Elampur north-west 2-4 miles. This height was deduced trigonometrically. Chandaus is distant 20 miles from Aligarh and 6 miles from Somna. The population in 1865 was 2,512, and in 1872 was 2,931. There is a police-station and a post-office here. The Chaukid\u00e1ri Act (XX. of 1856) is in force in Chandaus, and in 1873 supported a village police numbering seven men of all grades at an annual cost of Rs. 396. The number of the houses in the town in 1872-73 was 620, and of these 570 were assessed with a house-tax averaging Re. 1-3-7 per house and Re. 0-3-9 per head of the population per annum. The income for the same year was Rs. 724, including a balance of Rs. 28 from the previous year, and the expenditure was Rs. 627.\n\nChandaus, a parganah of tahsil Khair in the Aligarh district, is bounded on the north by parganah Kh\u00farja of the Bulandshahr district, on the south by Khair, on the east by Kh\u00farja and Koil, and on the west by parganah Jewar of the Bulandshahr district and Tappal of this district. According to the census of 1872 this parganah had then a total area of 103 square miles and 137 acres, of which 68 square miles were under cultivation. The area assessed to Government revenue during the same year was 102 square miles, of which\n67 square miles were cultivated, 14 square miles were culturable, and 21 square miles were barren. Chandaus is drained by the Karon Nadi, which is dry except during the rains. Three separate lines of bh\u0101r or sandhills run through this parganah and Khair, and of these the western ridge, which may be said to form the natural boundary between Chandaus and Tappal, is almost unbroken. The middle ridge follows the course of the Karon Nadi, crossing the stream from the left to the right bank near Doohts, whilst the eastern ridge, rising here and there among lowlying villages, is less easily traced as a continuous line; occasional short spurs jut out from each range. Water is found at a depth of 18 to 30 feet from the surface, and wicker-lined wells, which last from two to three years, are easily made. Of the 79 estates at settlement, 39 were zam\u012bnd\u0101ri, 37 were imperfect pattid\u0101ri, one was imperfect pattid\u0101ri, and two were held free of revenue, and in all these estates only 10-57 per cent. of the land-revenue was paid by landholders possessing one or more villages.\n\nThe following statement shows the changes that have occurred in this parganah since 1838:\n\n| Caste       | Area held in 1838 | Area transferred | Area held in 1868 |\n|-------------|-------------------|------------------|------------------|\n|             | Acres             | Acres            | Acres            |\n|             |                   |                  | Area            |\n|             |                   |                  | Revenue         |\n| Chandaus   | 26,091            | 18,673           | 14,415           | 15,554          |\n| J\u0101t        | 15,756            | 4,098            | 11,659           | 15,921          |\n| J\u0101don      | 3,881             | 1,634            | 12,267           | 3,068           |\n| Brahman    | 4,491             | 2,683            | 1,736            | 1,078           |\n| Goahin     | 605               | 101              | 504              | 788             |\n| Nau-Muslim | 12,613            | 5,846            | 6,767            | 6,962           |\n| Sikh       | 309               | 154              | 155              | 223             |\n| Total      | 65,676            | 24,182           | 37,494           | 43,207          |\n\nChandaus includes taluka Pis\u0101wa, which is separately mentioned in the district notice. The present settlement was made by Mr. W. H. Smith. The statistics of area show a total area of 66,843 acres, of which 13,382 acres are entered as barren and 1,028 as held free of revenue. The assessable area is distributed as follows:\n\n| Cultivable. | Cultivated. |\n|-------------|-------------|\n| New fallow.| Old waste.  |\n| Groves.    | Total.      |\n| Irrigated. | Dry.        |\n| Grand Total.| Total.      |\n| 648        | 8,101       |\n| 157        | 8,906       |\n| 28,763     | 19,944      |\n| 43,037     | 51,933      |\nThese figures show that the proportion of culturable land to the total area amounts to 78 per cent., and the proportion of cultivation to the culturable area is 83 per cent. Irrigation reaches only 55 per cent. of the cultivated area, and only 17 per cent. of the culturable waste is available for the extension of cultivation. Much of this culturable waste is under dh\u00e1k jungle which sooner or later must come under the plough, but much of it also is of such a character as will prevent any attempt at its cultivation, so that on the whole the actual margin of available land fit for cultivation is hardly more than ten per cent. of the cultivated area in this parganah.\n\nBy the recent settlement the land-revenue has been fixed at Rs. 90,890 and the cesses at Rs. 9,089. The new land-revenue falls at Rs. 2-1-9 on the cultivated acre, and gives a rise of 14 per cent. on the old assessment (Rs. 79,308). Irrigation has increased by 32\u00bd per cent., and cultivation by 3\u00bd per cent., since last settlement.\n\nThe statistics of the successive revisions of settlement in this parganah may be shown as follows:\n\n| Year | No. of villages | Land-revenue |\n|------|----------------|--------------|\n|      |                | Rs.          |\n| 1809-11 | ...            | 48,232       |\n| 1812-15 | 60             | 53,929       |\n| 1816-20 | 61             | 60,661       |\n\n| Year | No. of villages | Land-revenue |\n|------|----------------|--------------|\n|      |                | Rs.          |\n| 1821-37 | ...            | 61           |\n| 1838-68 | ...            | 64           |\n| 1868   | ...            | ...          |\n|        |                | 79,141       |\n\nDuring the first settlement several villages now separated were then included in others, but, on the whole, the parganah was much as it is now, and two villages were then and are still held free of revenue. The revenue of four villages of the second settlement and of three villages of the third settlement cannot now be traced. 4,441 acres were farmed for arrears of land-revenue during the currency of the past settlement, and 2,926 acres were sold, aggregating 11 per cent. of the total area and 14 per cent. of the revenue. Much of this was due to the difficulty found in borrowing money, owing to the smallness of the security that could be offered by the petty proprietary body and the absence of any wealthy body of traders. Rs. 4,728 were remitted from the revenue demand in Chandaus during 1860-61, but, as a rule, the revenue has been punctually paid in this parganah. The following statement shows the mode of transfer, the average price per acre, and the average number of years' purchase of the land-revenue brought by the areas transferred between 1838 and 1868. It is to be\nnoted that if a single plot or estate has changed hands ten times, ten entries have been made in this account:\n\n| Mode of transfer | 1838-1848 | 1849-1858 | 1859-1868 | Total |\n|------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------|\n|                  | Area | Price per acre | Years purchase | Area | Price per acre | Years purchase | Area | Price per acre | Years purchase |\n| Private sale     | 1,108 | Rs. 15 | 6 | 2-96 | 9,774 | Rs. 8 | 9 | 6-1 | 11,787 | Rs. 2 | 2 | 7 |\n| Mortgage         | 5,518 | Rs. 9 | 5 | 1-27 | 4,566 | Rs. 6 | 1 | 10 | 4,996 | Rs. 11 | 8 | 4-27 |\n| Auction sale     | 6,504 | Rs. 4 | 5 | 2-43 | 2,677 | Rs. 6 | 5 | 3-35 | 4,373 | Rs. 18 | 8 | 3-66 |\n| Total            | 11,885 | Rs. 3 | 6 | 2-21 | 10,317 | Rs. 5 | 3 | 4-86 | 24,503 | Rs. 13 | 9 | 5-56 |\n\nThe transfers by revenue process have also been considerable, amounting to 2,866 acres during the first ten years of the expired settlement, and showing for the whole term 4,441 acres farmed for arrears of revenue and 2,926 sold on the same account. The average price brought at these sales was only Rs. 2-4-10 per acre, or 1-48 year's purchase on the revenue. Private sales are the true standard of the value of land, and in this parganah the price at private sales during the last twelve years of the expired settlement was 102-6 per cent. higher than during the first eleven years. On the whole, 32 per cent. of the area bearing 34 per cent. of the land-revenue had been permanently alienated in 1868, and 11 per cent. of the area bearing 12 per cent. of the revenue was mortgaged or in farm. Out of 28,182 acres transferred, 11,728 acres belonged to proprietors owning three-fourths of a village or more. The kharif crop occupies 44 per cent. of the entire cultivated area, and in it jodr covers 16 per cent. of the total area, bajar 12 per cent., cotton 9 per cent., and moth 6 per cent. Amongst the rabi crops, wheat occupies 17 per cent. of the total cultivation, bajir 20 per cent., and gram 8 per cent. 4,092 acres, or 9 per cent. of the cultivation, are leased on payments in kind. There were 9,245 bulls and bullocks, 5,192 buffaloes, 6,244 cows, 522 horses, and 6,375 goats and sheep in the parganah in 1868. 640 holdings are held as seer by proprietors, 623 by hereditary tenants, and 1,505 by tenants-at-will, including revenue-free estates, with an average area of 22-2 acres, 11-1 acres, and 15 acres respectively. The average rental is Rs. 3-7-2 per acre, and hereditary tenants pay on an average Rs. 3-1-8 per acre, whilst tenants-at-will pay Rs. 3-8-10 per acre. Altogether 30 per cent. of the cultivated area is held by cultivating proprietors. At the commencement of the expired settlement only 70 holdings were entered as possessed by hereditary tenants, with an average area of 15-2 acres and an average rental of Rs. 2-7-0 per acre, whilst tenants-at-will held 1,493 holdings, with an average area of 17\nacres and an average rental of Rs. 2-12-5 per acre. The comparative areas held by each class are as follows:\n\n|                | 1868 |       | 1869 |       |\n|----------------|------|-------|------|-------|\n|                | Area | Rent  | Area | Rent  |\n| Hereditary tenants | ...  | 1,064 | 2,596| 6,925 | 21,510 |\n| Tenants-at-will   | ...  | 25,419| 70,819| 32,672| 80,570 |\n\nAccording to the census of 1872 parganah Chandaus contained 64 inhabited villages, of which 12 had less than 200 inhabitants; 20 had between 200 and 500; 21 had between 500 and 1,000; 9 had between 1,000 and 2,000; and 2 had between 2,000 and 3,000. The settlement records show that in 1874 there were 76 mah\u00e1ls or estates in the parganah, and 66 villages, with an average area of 1,005 acres; the largest having 3,835 acres, and the smallest having 105 acres. The total population in 1872 numbered 38,699 souls (18,033 females), giving 376 to the square mile. Classified according to religion, there were 35,172 Hind\u00fas, of whom 16,818 were females; 3,537 Musalm\u00e1ns, amongst whom 1,645 were females. Distributing the Hind\u00fa population amongst the four great classes, the census shows 6,456 Brahmans, of whom 2,999 were females; 4,828 Rajp\u00fats, including 2,164 females; 1,603 Baniyas (760 females); whilst the great mass of the population is included in \"the other castes\" of the census returns, which show a total of 22,285 souls, of whom 10,465 are females. The principal Brahman subdivisions found in this parganah are the Gaur (4,080), Saraswat (291), and Kanaujiya. The Rajp\u00fats belong to the Chauh\u00e1n (2,538), Badgujar (140), Gahlot (61), J\u00e1don (1,221), Jaingh\u00e9ra (179), and Bh\u00e1l clans, and the Baniyas to the Agarw\u00e1l (454), Dasa (588), Chausaini, Mahes\u0144i, B\u00e1rahssaini, and Gur\u00e1k\u00fa subdivisions. Amongst the other castes, the following have more than one thousand members each:\u2014J\u00e1t (4,381), Cham\u00e1r (5,700), Khat\u00edk (1,787), and Orh (1,055); the following having between one hundred and one thousand members:\u2014Son\u00e1r, Barhai, Hajj\u00e1m, M\u00e1li, Bh\u00e1t, Kal\u00e1l, Gos\u00e1h\u00edn, Ahir, Darzi, Kah\u00e1r, Jog\u00ed, Bair\u00e1g\u00ed, Dhobi, Loh\u00e1r, Koli, Sweeper, Kumh\u00e1r, Garariya, Aheriya (376), Banj\u00e1ra, Dh\u00fana, Teli, and Riw\u00e1ri. The Musalm\u00e1ns comprise Shaikhs (232), Path\u00e1ns (98), Musalm\u00e1n Rajp\u00fats (89), and those entered without distinction.\n\nThe occupations of the people are shown in the statistics collected at the census of 1872. From these it appears that of the male adult population (not less than fifteen years of age) 114\nare employed in professional avocations, such as Government servants, priests, doctors, and the like; 1,308 in domestic service, as personal servants, water-carriers, barbers, sweepers, washermen, &c.; 558 in commerce, in buying, selling, keeping or lending money or goods, or the conveyance of men, animals, or goods; 6,750 in agricultural operations; 1,444 in industrial occupations, arts and mechanics, and the preparation of all classes of substances, vegetable, mineral, and animal. There were 1,928 persons returned as labourers and 365 as of no specified occupation. Taking the total population, irrespective of age or sex, the same returns give 723 as landholders, 18,909 as cultivators, and 19,667 as engaged in occupations unconnected with agriculture. The educational statistics, which are confessedly imperfect, show 810 males as able to read and write out of a total male population numbering 20,666 souls.\n\nIn 1838 Chandaus comprised 62 villages, with an area of 60,441 acres and a revenue of Rs. 72,266, and in 1840-41 one village was received from parganah Koil, two villages from Khurja in the Bulandshahr district, and one village from Khair, leaving Chandaus possessed of 66 villages. Chandaus was originally occupied and owned by Chauhans; but even at last settlement the Jats of the Tappal family held nearly half the parganah. The Chauhans, however, still retain 17 out of 21 villages held by them in 1838.\n\nChhabra Rafaipur, a town in parganah Gangiri of the Aligarh district, is distant 23 miles from Aligarh and 11 miles from Atrauli. The population in 1865 numbered 2,130 souls, and in 1872 there were 2,072 inhabitants. The Chaukidari Act (XX. of 1856) is in force in Chhabra, and in 1873 supported a village police numbering three men of all grades, at an annual cost of Rs. 162. The number of the houses in the town in 1872-73 was 454, and of these 402 were assessed with a house-tax averaging Re. 1-2-9 per head and Re. 0-3-8 per head of the population per annum. The income for the same year was Rs. 627, including a balance of Rs. 155 from the previous year, and the expenditure was Rs. 470.\n\nDadon, a town in parganah Gangiri of the Aligarh district, is distant 28 miles from Aligarh and 14 miles from Atrauli. The population in 1865 numbered 1,797 souls, and in 1872 there were 2,092 inhabitants. There is a police-station here since 1851, now a first-class station. The Chaukidari Act (XX. of 1856) is in force in Dadon, and in 1873 supported a village police numbering five men of all grades at an annual cost of Rs. 288. The number of the houses in the town in 1872-73 was 427, and of these 359 were assessed with a house-tax averaging Re. 0-9-2 per head and Re. 0-1-7 per head of the population per annum. The income for the same year was Rs. 240, including a balance of Rs. 34 from the previous year, and the expenditure was Rs. 235. Dadon is the residence of a branch of the Bhikampur talukadari family.\nDARYAPUR, a town in parganah H\u00e1thras of the Aligarh district, is distant six miles from H\u00e1thras and 14 miles from Aligarh. The population in 1865 numbered 2,729 souls, and in 1872 there were 2,763 inhabitants. Daryapur was the seat of an old r\u0101j held by the Porach Rajputs. It was taken from them by the J\u0101ts, and the Porachs retired to Hussain, which they have also recently lost. The Chaukid\u00e1ri Act (XX. of 1856) is in force in Daryapur, and in 1873 supported a village police numbering seven men of all grades, at an annual cost of Rs. 396. The number of the houses in the town in 1872-73 was 594, and of these 549 were assessed with a house-tax averaging Re. 1-0-10 per house and Re. 0-3-4 per head of the population per annum. The income for the same year was Rs. 689, including a balance of Rs. 110 from the previous year, and the expenditure was Rs. 632.\n\nDATAULI, a town in parganah Atrauli of the Aligarh district, is distant 21 miles from Aligarh and 10 miles from Atrauli. The population in 1865 was 2,934, and in 1872 there were 3,437 inhabitants. Datauli gives its name to a taluka held by Path\u00e1ns, some account of whom is given under the district notice. The Chaukid\u00e1ri Act (XX. of 1856) is in force in Datauli, and in 1873 supported a village police numbering seven men of all grades at an annual cost of Rs. 396. The number of the houses in the town in 1872-73 was 722, and of these 588 were assessed with a house-tax averaging Re. 0-15-2 per house and Re. 0-2-7 per head of the population per annum. The income for the same year was Rs. 558, including a balance of Re. 0-1-0 from the previous year, and the expenditure was Rs. 558.\n\nGANGFRI, a parganah in the Atrauli tahsil of the Aligarh district, is bounded on the north by parganah Atrauli and the Ganges, on the east by the Eta district, on the west by Atrauli and Koil, and on the south by Akra-bad and Sikandra Rao. According to the census of 1872 this parganah had then a total area of 185 square miles and 30 acres, of which 125 square miles were under cultivation. The area assessed to Government revenue during the same year was 184 square miles, of which 124 square miles were cultivated, 37 square miles were culturable, and 23 square miles were barren. Until 1870 Gangfri was confined to a narrow strip of land running along the eastern side of parganah Atrauli from north to south, and containing only 26 villages, with an area of 27,097 acres, or 42-3 square miles. More than three-fourths of its present area has been received from parganah Atrauli since then. As these changes were made subsequent to the preparation of the rent-rate reports, it is very difficult to make any comparison with past statistics. It will be merely necessary here to refer to the results of the present settlement as affecting the present area. The area in 1874 amounted to 118,349 acres, or 184 square miles and 589 acres, of which 14,822 acres were barren,\n\n1 For an account of Gangfri as it was, see Rev. Rep., IV., 87.\nand 316 acres were held free of revenue. The assessable area was distributed as follows:\n\n| Culturable | Cultivated |\n|------------|------------|\n| New fallow | Old waste  |\n| Acres      | Acres      |\n| 3,039      | 19,528     |\n| Groves     | Total      |\n| Acres      | Acres      |\n| 1,066      | 33,633     |\n| Total      |            |\n| Acres      | Acres      |\n| 33,633     | 33,816     |\n| Irrigated  | Dry        |\n| Acres      | Acres      |\n| 46,749     | 79,578     |\n| Total      |            |\n| Acres      |            |\n| 108,211    |            |\n\nHere the culturable area is 87 per cent. of the total area, the cultivated area is 77 per cent. of the culturable area, and the irrigated area is 41 per cent. of the cultivated area. The actual margin left for increased cultivation is 22 per cent. of the culturable area. Seven villages in the Ganges khadir are assessed for terms of five years only. The total land-revenue of the parganah at present is Rs. 1,44,909, and the cesses are Rs. 14,413.\n\nAccording to the census of 1872 parganah Gangiri contained 133 inhabited villages, of which 33 had less than 200 inhabitants; 51 had between 200 and 500; 33 had between 500 and 1,000; 8 had between 1,000 and 2,000; 6 had between 2,000 and 3,000, and two had between 3,000 and 5,000. The towns containing more than 5,000 inhabitants were the total population in 1872 numbered 76,727 souls (35,831 females), giving 415 to the square mile. Classified according to religion, there were 63,324 Hind\u00fas, of whom 29,846 were females; 13,396 Musalm\u00e1ns, amongst whom 6,483 were females; and 7 Christians. Distributing the Hind\u00fa population amongst the four great classes, the census shows 4,783 Brahmans, of whom 1,283 were females; 2,124 Rajp\u00fats, including 905 females; 2,399 Baniyas (1,131 females); whilst the great mass of the population is included in \u201cthe other castes\u201d of the census returns, which show a total of 54,018 souls, of whom 25,127 are females. The principal Brahman subdivisions found in this parganah are the Gaur (217), Saraswat, and Kanaujiya. The Rajp\u00fats chiefly belong to the Chauh\u00e1n (306), Badg\u00faj\u00e1r, Gahlot, J\u00e1don (652), Pundir, Solankhi, Gaharw\u00e1r, Bais, Gaur, and Aghaya clans; and the Baniyas to the D\u00e1s Chaussaini (269), Agarw\u00e1l, B\u00e1rahsaini and Mahesri subdivisions. Amongst the other castes the following show more than one thousand members:\u2014J\u00e1t (3,893), Barhai, Hajjam, Kal\u00e1i (1,753), Ah\u00edr (8,633), K\u00e1chhi (2,666), Kah\u00e1r, Koli (2,271), Cham\u00e1r (12,969), Khat\u00edk, Kh\u00e1krob, Garariya (2,396), and Lodha (5,932). The following castes have less than one thousand, but more than one hundred.\nmembers each:\u2014Son\u00e1r, M\u00e1li, Gosh\u00e1in, Darzi, Jog\u00ed, Bair\u00e1g\u00ed, Dhobi, Knmh\u00e1r, Aheriya, Banj\u00e1ra, K\u00e1yath, Mall\u00e1h, and Teli. The Musalm\u00e1ns comprise Shaikhs (1,640), Sayyids (646), Maghals (71), and Path\u00e1ns (4,222); the remaining Muhammadans are unspecified.\n\nThe land-revenue for 1872 amounted to Rs. 1,44,909 (or with cesses Rs. 1,66,541), falling at a rate of Re. 1-3-7 per British acre on the total area, at Re. 1-3-8 per acre on the area assessed to Government revenue, and at Re. 1-13-1 per acre on the cultivated area. The sum paid by cultivators to the landowners as rent and cesses during the same year has been estimated at Rs. 2,73,939.\n\nThe occupations of the people are shown in the statistics collected at the census of 1872. From these it appears that of the male adult population (not less than fifteen years of age) 108 are employed in professional avocations, such as Government servants, priests, doctors, and the like; 2,777 in domestic service, as personal servants, water-carriers, barbers, sweepers, washermen, &c.; 1,171 in commerce, in buying, selling, keeping or lending money or goods, or the conveyance of men, animals, or goods; 13,434 in agricultural operations; 2,891 in industrial occupations, arts and mechanics, and the preparation of all classes of substances, vegetable, mineral, and animal. There were 3,792 persons returned as labourers and 395 as of no specified occupation. Taking the total population, irrespective of age or sex, the same returns give 1,169 as landholders, 40,379 as cultivators, and 35,179 as engaged in occupations unconnected with agriculture. The educational statistics, which are confessedly imperfect, show 1,172 males as able to read and write out of a total male population numbering 40,896 souls. In 1854 parganah Gang\u00edri received three villages from Atrauli, making in all 26 villages. Its present boundaries were fixed in 1870, and increased the area from 27,097 acres to 118,349 acres, by the addition of villages from parganah Atrauli (see ATRAULI parganah). One-third of the proprietary rights in the old parganah has changed hands and been permanently alienated from the original owners between 1839 and 1868, or 170 shares out of 520.\n\nGang\u00edri, a village in parganah Atrauli of the Aligarh district, is distant 24 miles from Aligarh and 16 miles from Atrauli. The population in 1865 numbered 1,284 souls, and in 1872 there were 2,253 inhabitants. Gang\u00edri lies on the route from Koil by Jal\u00e1l\u00ed and K\u00e1sganj to Budaon, distant 11\u00bd miles from Jal\u00e1l\u00ed and 12\u00bd miles from K\u00e1sganj. For the road from Jal\u00e1l\u00ed see JAL\u00c1LI. To K\u00e1sganj the road is unmetalled throughout, and crosses the Nim Nadi by a bridge at Mals\u00e1i, and passes Dholna at five miles. The Chawkid\u00e1ri Act (XX. of 1856) is in force in Gang\u00edri, and in 1873 supported a village police\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 G. O., N. W. P., No. 182, dated 7th February, 1870.\nnumbering 4 men of all grades at an annual cost of Rs. 216. The number of the houses in the town in 1872-73 was 469, and of these 387 were assessed with a house-tax averaging Re. 0-15-3 per house and Re. 0-2-7 per head of the population per annum. The income for the same year was Rs. 417, including a balance of Rs. 49 from the previous year, and the expenditure was Rs. 365. There is a police-station here and a post-office.\n\nGaunda, a town in parganah Gorai of the Aligarh district, is distant 16 miles from Beswan and 12 miles from Aligarh. In 1865 there were 2,052 inhabitants, and in 1872 there were 2,312. There is an outpost of police here.\n\nGharbara, a town in parganah Khair of the Aligarh district, is distant 37 miles from Aligarh and 6 miles from Tappal. The population in 1865 numbered 2,578 souls, and in 1872 there were 2,351 inhabitants.\n\nGorai, a parganah in tahsil Igl\u00e1s of the Aligarh district, is bounded on the north by Hasangarh, on the south by part of Hasangarh and the Mahaban parganah of Muttra, on the east by parganah H\u00e1thras, and on the west by the Muttra district. According to the census of 1872 this parganah had then a total area of 88 square miles and 462 acres, of which 79 square miles were under cultivation. The area assessed to Government revenue during the same year was 80 square miles, of which 71 square miles were cultivated, 3 square miles were culturable, and 6 square miles were barren. The general features of the parganah resemble those of Hasangarh, and both are described under Igl\u00e1s. The changes that took place during the currency of the past settlement have been so great as to render any comparison of the state of the parganah as it now exists with the statistics of previous settlements difficult without details which are out of place here. The existing settlement was made by Mr. A. B. Patterson. The total area was then found to comprise 56,797 acres, of which 4,020 acres were barren and 1,763 acres were held free of revenue. The statistics of the assessable area are as follows:\n\n| Cultivable | Cultivated | Total |\n|------------|------------|-------|\n| New.       | Old.       |        |\n| Fallow.    | Waste.     |        |\n| Groves.    |            |        |\n| Total.     |            |        |\n\nThese figures show that the percentage of the culturable to the total area is 90, of cultivation to the culturable area is 95, and of irrigation to cultivation is 80. Only five per cent. of the culturable area remains to come under the plough. Cultivation has increased by 0\u00b78 per cent. since last settlement, and irrigation\nby 19\u00b72 per cent. The land-revenue assessed amounts to Rs. 1,32,110, and the cesses to Rs. 12,211. During the currency of the past settlement, 18 whole villages and 54 parts of villages, comprising 20,816 acres, were transferred in Igl\u00e1s, and of these 16,394 acres passed forever from the hands of the old proprietary body. In addition, 7,613 acres were temporarily farmed on account of arrears of land-revenue. As the settlement went on the rise in prices told on the value of the land, and by the close of the settlement the average price per acre increased by 65 per cent. Talukas Kanka, Igl\u00e1s, Besw\u00e1n, and Kajraut are separately mentioned in the district notice.\n\nThe following table shows the mode of transfer, the area transferred, the price per acre, and the number of years' purchase on the land-revenue of the areas transferred during the three decades of the expired settlement. The average price from all sources was Rs. 9-2-11 per acre, and the average years' purchase was 4\u00b705 years.\n\n| Mode of transfer | 1839-1848 | 1849-1858 | 1859-1868 |\n|------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n|                  | Acres     | Rs. a. p. | Years' purchase | Acres     | Rs. a. p. | Years' purchase | Acres     | Rs. a. p. | Years' purchase |\n| Private sale     | 1,385     | 6 14 7    | 8\u00bd        | 3,171     | 6 3 9     | 4\u00bd        | 4,584     | 11 9 21    | 5\u00bd        |\n| Mortgage         | 4,544     | 6 3 3     | 2\u00bd        | 9,569     | 8 2 6     | 5\u00bd        | 4,008     | 12 7 8     | 5\u00bd        |\n| Auction by Court | 5,470     | 7 7 5     | 3\u00bd        | 2,937     | 10 1 7    | 4\u00bd        | 2,956     | 10 10 10   | 4\u00bd        |\n| Sale for arrears of revenue | 235 | 5 2 1 | ... | ... | ... | ... | 1,088 | 7 3 9 | 4\u00bd |\n| Total            | 11,613    | 6 13 6    | 2\u00bd        | 8,677     | 9 3 10    | 4\u00bd        | 12,596    | 11 4 9     | 5\u00bd        |\n\nIn Gorai, out of 48,787 acres under cultivation at measurement, 38,355 acres, or 78\u00b76 per cent., were held by tenants; and of these, 10,959 acres, or 28\u00b75 per cent., were held by tenants with a right of occupancy, each of whose holdings on an average covered 11\u00b79 acres, whilst the average holding of tenants-at-will was 14\u00b71 acres, and of all tenants was 13\u00b72 acres. Tenants with a right of occupancy paid an average rental of Rs. 3-13-3 per acre, and tenants-at-will paid Rs 4-1-8 per acre, the average for all being Rs. 4-0-5 per acre. Sixty villages are held on a zamindari tenure, four villages in perfect pattidari, and 59 villages in bh\u00e1yach\u00e1ra tenure. Fifty-two villages, paying a revenue of Rs. 45,687, belong to proprietors who own more than one village; 15 villages, paying a revenue of Rs. 11,713, belong to one owner or to less than six sharers; and 46 villages, paying Rs. 52,208, to more than six sharers. Rs. 7,030 were remitted in 1838 on account of the famine of 1837, and Rs. 2,516 were remitted in 1862 on account of the famine of 1860-61.\nAccording to the census of 1872 parganah Gorai contained 105 inhabited villages, of which 39 had less than 200 inhabitants; 35 had between 200 and 500; 19 had between 500 and 1,000; 11 had between 1,000 and 2,000, and one had between 3,000 and 5,000.\n\nThe settlement records show 113 villages distributed amongst 116 mahals or estates in 1874. The average area of each village is 503 acres. The total population in 1872 numbered 47,827 souls (21,848 females), giving 537 to the square mile. Classified according to religion, there were 45,156 Hind\u00fas, of whom 20,629 were females; 2,671 Musalm\u00e1ns, amongst whom 1,219 were females. Distributing the Hind\u00fa population amongst the four great classes, the census shows 10,845 Brahmans, of whom 4,925 were females; 752 Rajputs, including 341 females; 2,229 Baniyas (1,030 females); whilst the great mass of the population is included in \u201cthe other castes\u201d of the census returns, which show a total of 31,330 souls, of whom 14,333 are females. The principal Brahman subdivisions found in this parganah are the Saraswat (1,229) and Gaur (370); the Rajputs chiefly belong to the J\u00e9don (230), Jangh\u00e1ra, (188), Chauh\u00e1n, Badg\u00fajar, Gahlot and Jaisw\u00e1r clans, and the Baniyas belong to the Agarw\u00e1l (1,254), D\u00e1s\u00e1, Chausaini, Mahesri, and B\u00e1rah\u00e1sini subdivisions. Amongst the other castes the following show more than one thousand members:\u2014J\u00e1t (9,958), Barhai, Hajj\u00e1m, K\u00e1chhi (1,118), Koli (1,283), Cham\u00e1r (7,514), Khat\u00edk, Kh\u00e1krob, and Garariya (1,131). The following have between one hundred and one thousand members each:\u2014Son\u00e1r, Bh\u00e1t, Kal\u00e1l, Darzi, Kah\u00e1r, Jogi, Bair\u00e1gi, Dhobi, Kamh\u00e1r, Aheriya, K\u00e1yath, Dh\u00fana, Mall\u00e1h, and Teli. Musalm\u00e1ns comprise Shaikhs (111) and Path\u00e1ns (177); the remainder are unspecified.\n\nThe occupations of the people are shown in the statistics collected at the census of 1872. From these it appears that of the male adult population (not less than fifteen years of age) 174 are employed in professional avocations, such as Government servants, priests, doctors, and the like; 1,814 in domestic service, as personal servants, water-carriers, barbers, sweepers, washermen, &c.; 902 in commerce, in buying, selling, keeping or lending money or goods, or the conveyance of men, animals, or goods; 7,898 in agricultural operations; 2,014 in industrial occupations, arts and mechanics, and the preparation of all classes of substances, vegetable, mineral, and animal. There were 2,862 persons returned as labourers and 407 as of no specified occupation. Taking the total population, irrespective of age or sex, the same returns give 1,433 as landholders, 21,340 as cultivators, and 25,954 as engaged in occupations unconnected with agriculture. The educational statistics, which are confessedly imperfect, show 1,249 males as able to read and write out of a total male population numbering 25,979 souls. At the last settlement Gorai contained 38 villages, with an area of 28,426\nacres. Since then 65 villages have been added from Koil and 10 from Muttra; in all 75 villages, with an area of 27,171 acres and a revenue of Rs. 45,901.\n\nHasangarh, a parganah in tahsil Igl\u00e1s of the Aligarh district, is bounded on the north by parganahs Khair and Koil, on the south by Gorai, on the west, by Muttra, and on the east by Koil. A portion of the parganah lies to the south of Gorai and between it and Mursan. According to the statistics of the census of 1872 the parganah had then a total area of 125 square miles, of which 109 square miles were under cultivation. The area assessed to Government revenue during the same year was 124 square miles, of which 108 square miles were cultivated, seven square miles were culturable, and nine square miles were barren.\n\nAs the general features of both parganah Hasangarh and parganah Gorai are the same, they are noticed as one under tahsil Igl\u00e1s (see Igl\u00e1s). The changes that have taken place in the area of the parganah during the currency of the last settlement render any comparison of its fiscal returns difficult without going into a detail which appears to be unnecessary. The existing settlement was made by Mr. A. B. Patterson. The total area was then found to be 79,771 acres, of which 5,805 acres were barren and 402 acres were held free of revenue. The statistics of the assessable area are as follows:\n\n| Cultivable | Cultivated | Total |\n|------------|------------|-------|\n| New fallow | Old waste | Groves | Total | Irrigated | Dry | Total | Total |\n| Acres      | Acres     | Acres | Acres | Acres     | Acres | Acres | Acres |\n| 779        | 3,673     | 75    | 4,727 | 50,634    | 18,903| 69,537| 73,564|\n\nFrom the above it will be seen that the proportion of culturable land to the total area is 92 per cent., of cultivation to the culturable area is 94 per cent., and of irrigated to cultivated area is 73 per cent. Only six per cent. of the total culturable area is available for the extension of cultivation. Cultivation has increased by 5\u00b76 per cent. since last settlement, and irrigation by 28 per cent. The new assessment amounts to Rs. 1,65,584, and the cesses to Rs. 16,558. During the currency of the past settlement, 18 whole villages and 89 parts of villages, comprising 38,960 acres, changed hands, or more than one-half the total area, and of this 28,394 acres were permanently transferred from the industrious J\u0101ts; and besides these, 10,492 acres were farmed for arrears of revenue. At first land in this parganah fetched only 2\u00b75 years' purchase of the land-revenue; but by the close of the settlement in 1868 the value of land had increased by ninety per cent., and this enhancement has fallen into the hands of the land speculators who bought up the land during the earlier years, when the pressure of the assessment was most felt. On the whole the parganah is one of the most\nfertile and the most flourishing in the district. Cultivation and irrigation have nearly reached their maximum, and the recent arrangements have left a sufficient margin to the cultivators, from which they can easily keep out of fresh debts and meet those already in existence. One should not hear of excessive transfers again in this parganah. The following table shows the mode of transfer, area transferred, average price per acre, and average number of years' purchase of the land-revenue in each decade of the expired settlement. The average price per acre from all sources was Rs. 8-9-1, and the average years' purchase was 3-12:\n\n| Mode of transfer | 1839-1848 | 1849-1858 | 1859-1868 |\n|------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n|                  | Area      | Average price per acre | Years' purchase | Area      | Average price per acre | Years' purchase | Area      | Average price per acre | Years' purchase |\n| Private sale     | 3,631     | 8 14 8    | 1         | 5,112     | 5 3 1     | 2\u00bd       | 8,323     | 8 0 9     | 3\u00bc       |\n| Mortgage         | 2,881     | 4 9 1     | 1\u00bd       | 5,870     | 9 6 6     | 3\u00be       | 6,946     | 12 11 9   | 5\u00bd       |\n| Auction by Courts | 7,381   | 7 11 7    | 3 \u00bd      | 5,500     | 12 10 6   | 5\u00bd       | 6,931     | 10 9 11   | 4\u00bd       |\n| Sale for arrears of revenue | 1,638   | 1 14 6    | 1         | 138       | 3 8 11    | 11       | 396       | 2 8 5     | 11       |\n| Total            | 15,551    | 5 10 4    | 2 \u00bd      | 16,029    | 9 2 1     | 8\u00bd       | 29,094    | 11 8 2    | 4\u00bd       |\n\nIn Hasangarh tenants cultivate 44,972 acres, or 63\u00b77 per cent. of the total cultivated area. Of this, 9,082 acres, or 21\u00b72 per cent., are held by tenants with a right of occupancy, whose average holding is 8\u00b76 acres. Tenants-at-will cultivate holdings averaging 9\u00b76 acres each. The latter pay an average rental of Rs. 4-3-8 per acre, whilst the former pay Rs. 3-14-6 per acre, the average for all tenants being Rs. 4-2-7 per acre. Though Hasangarh is inferior in its soil to the neighbouring parganah of Gorai, the average rent-rate is higher, which is partly attributable to the greater influx of new landholders into Hasangarh, and an effort on their part to raise the general rate. In Hasangarh only 13 villages, paying a revenue of Rs. 10,775, belong to proprietors who own more than one village; 12, paying Rs. 12,885, belong to less than six sharers; and the remainder, paying a revenue of Rs. 1,85,307, belong to cultivating communities. In these property is generally much subdivided. In 1838 Rs. 10,117 were remitted on account of the famine of 1837, and Rs. 9,602 were remitted in 1862 on account of the famine of 1860-61. From the statistics of 97 villages in the whole\nALIGARH DISTRICT.\n\ntabshl, the following facts in regard to the growth of tenant-rights during the currency of the past settlement are gathered:\n\n| Year | Hereditary tenants | Tenants-at-will | Total |\n|------|-------------------|-----------------|-------|\n|      | Holdings | Area | Rent | Holdings | Area | Rent | Holdings | Area | Rent |\n| 1838 | ... | 150 | 9,018 | 10,692 | 2,641 | 26,910 | 95,462 | 2,791 | 29,823 | 1,06,154 |\n| 1868 | ... | 1,179 | 9,869 | 34,143 | 3,871 | 37,741 | 1,61,363 | 5,060 | 47,610 | 1,96,005 |\n\nThese hereditary tenants in 1838 paid Rs. 3-8-9 per acre; they now pay Rs. 3-7-4, showing a decrease of 2\u00bd per cent: the tenants-at-will then paid Rs. 3-10-3 per acre; they now pay Rs. 4-4-4 per acre, showing an increase of 17\u00be per cent. The general rise in rents amounts to 13 per cent. The assumed average rental per acre at assessment was Rs. 5-10-11 for irrigated land in the tahsil and Rs. 2-2-4 for dry land, or a cultivation rate of Rs. 4-13-5.\n\nAccording to the census of 1872 parganah Hasangarh contained 107 inhabited villages, of which 27 had less than 200 inhabitants; 36 had between 200 and 500; 28 had between 500 and 1,000; 10 had between 1,000 and 2,000; 4 had between 2,000 and 8,000, and two had between 3,000 and 5,000. The towns containing more than 5,000 inhabitants were\n\nThe settlement records show 113 villages, distributed amongst 117 mahals or estates in 1874. The average area of each village is 705 acres. The total population in 1872 numbered 66,838 souls (30,378 females), giving 535 to the square mile. Classified according to religion, there were 63,288 Hind\u00fas, of whom 28,687 were females; 3,550 Musalm\u00e1ns, amongst whom 1,691 were females. Distributing the Hind\u00fa population amongst the four great classes, the census shows 10,653 Brahmans, of whom 4,886 were females; 206 Rajp\u00fats, including 89 females; 3,124 Baniyas (1,436 females); whilst the great mass of the population is included in \u201cthe other castes\u201d of the census returns, which show a total of 49,305 souls, of whom 22,276 are females. The principal Brahman subdivisions found in this parganah are the Saraswat (879) and Gaur (346). The Rajp\u00fats are chiefly members of the Jangh\u00e1ra (148), Chubh\u00e1n and J\u00e1don clans, and the Baniyas belong to the Agarw\u00e1l (905), D\u00e1sa (484), Chausaini, Mah\u00e9sri, and B\u00e1rahsaini (1,194) subdivisions. Amongst the other castes the following have more than one thousand members each:\u2014J\u00e1t (20,552), Barhai, Haj\u00e1m, Kah\u00e1r, Bair\u00e1gi, Koli (3,246), Cham\u00e1r (9,345), Khatik, Kh\u00e1krob, and Garariya. The following\ncastes have less than one thousand and more than one hundred members each:\u2014Son\u00e1r, Bhat, Kal\u00e1l, K\u00e1chhi, Jogi, Darzi, Dhobi, Kumh\u00e1r, Orh, K\u00e1yath, Dh\u00e1na, and Teli. The Musalm\u00e1ns comprise Shaikhs (135) and Path\u00e1ns (151); the remainder are unspecified. The old parganah comprised 50 villages of Th\u00e1kurel J\u00e1ts and four villages of Brahmans, known as the \"Chawar (54) gaon\" but the J\u00e1ts have lost a good portion of their property owing to the severity of the last assessment, and have been replaced by Baniyas and land speculators.\n\nThe occupations of the people are shown in the statistics collected at the census of 1872. From these it appears that of the male adult population (not less than fifteen years of age) 305 are employed in professional avocations, such as Government servants, priests, doctors, and the like; 2,090 in domestic service, as personal servants, water-carriers, barbers, sweepers, washermen, &c.; 1,671 in commerce, in buying, selling, keeping or lending money or goods, or the conveyance of men, animals, or goods; 10,596 in agricultural operations; 3,540 in industrial occupations, arts, and mechanics, and the preparation of all classes of substances, vegetable, mineral, and animal. There were 8,935 persons returned as labourers and 750 as of no specified occupation. Taking the total population, irrespective of age or sex, the same returns give 1,255 as landholders, 27,748 as cultivators, and 37,835 as engaged in occupations unconnected with agriculture. The educational statistics, which are confessedly imperfect, show 1,495 males as able to read and write out of a total male population numbering 36,460 souls. Hassangarh, at the past settlement, comprised 54 villages, with an area of 51,951 acres and paying a revenue of Rs. 1,03,315. Since then 43 villages have been added to it from Hathras, 6 from Murs\u00e1n, 5 from Koil, and 1 from Khair; in all 55 villages, with an area of 26,941 acres and a land revenue amounting to Rs. 53,127.\n\nHATHYSA BHAGW\u00c1NTPUR, a town in parganah H\u00e1thras of the Aligarh district, is distant 3 miles from H\u00e1thras and 24 miles from Aligarh. In 1865 there were 1,854 inhabitants, and in 1872 there were 1,336. There is a police-station here.\n\nH\u00c1THRAS, or H\u00e1thras Kh\u00e1s as it is sometimes called, is a town in the parganah of the same name in the Aligarh district, situated in lat. 27\u00b0-35'-31,\" and long. 78\u00b0-6'-9\", distant from Aligarh 21 miles, 29 miles from Agra, and 24 miles from K\u00e1sanganj in Eta.\n\nIn 1847 H\u00e1thras had 22,903 inhabitants, in 1853 the population numbered 20,504, and in 1865 there were 23,722 inhabitants. The site has an area of 256 square acres, giving 92 souls to the acre. According to the census of 1872 there were 23,589 inhabitants, of whom 21,121 were Hind\u00fas (9,795 females) and 2,468 were Musalm\u00e1ns (1,076 females). Distributing the population amongst the rural and urban\nclasses, the returns show 30 landholders, 624 cultivators, and 22,935 persons pursuing occupations unconnected with agriculture. The number of enclosures in 1872 was 2,897, of which 332 were occupied by Musalm\u00e1ns. The number of houses during the same year was 5,057, of which 2,610 were built with skilled labour, and of these 149 were occupied by Musalm\u00e1ns. Of the 2,447 mud huts in the town 338 were owned by the same religionists. Taking the male adult population, 8,296 souls (not less than 15 years of age), we find the following occupations pursued by more than fifty males:\u2014Attorneys, 56; barbers, 177; beggars, 186; brokers, 232; cart-drivers, 245; confectioners, 238; cotton-cleaners, 147; flower-sellers, 142; goldsmiths, 98; grain-dealers, 56; grain-parchers, 118; greengrocers, 190; labourers, 978; merchants, 147; milk-sellers, 56; money-lenders, 95; painters, 166; pandits, 201; porters, 62; potters, 210; purohits, 99; servants, 1,971; shopkeepers, 1,009; sweepers, 99; tailors, 217; water-carriers, 137; weavers, 124; and weighmen, 72. The town is essentially a great centre of commerce, and most of the merchants belong to the Baniya class. The B\u00e1rahsaini and Agarw\u00e1ls (here of the Ch\u00faruw\u00e1la gotra) are the leading subdivisions. The Musalm\u00e1n portion of the population is insignificant, both in number and influence.\n\nThe general plan of the town is compact and the houses stand close together. A broad metalled road skirts the entire city where the walls once stood. One wide way passes through the centre from east to west, and two good roads pass from north to south dividing the town into six principal divisions known as the Nayaganj, Pur\u00e1naganj, the An\u00e1j (grain), Rui (cotton), Nimak (salt), Loha (iron), and Gurh\u00e1i (sugar) mandis or markets; Panserihatta or druggists' quarter; Baz\u00e1za (cloth-merchants), Halw\u00e1i (confectioners), and Bis\u00e1ti (pedlars) muhallas or wards, and the Chank Daulat R\u00e1m, where two roads cross. The names of these divisions show the thoroughly commercial character of the town. There are more brick-built and stone-fronted houses than mud huts, and this gives the town an appearance of solidity and prosperity which it also really possesses. The fostering care of successive Collectors is shown throughout. The streets and lanes are level, well-drained, and metalled. In 1824 Mr. W. J. Harding established Hardingganj, and in 1821 he inaugurated the existing drainage scheme, widened the streets, and repaired the wells. Mr. E. F. Tyler, in 1851-52, improved the town and the markets. The outskirts to the north along the circular road are being built over, and on the west the same improvement is going on. To the east of the town are the remains of Daya R\u00e1m's fort, consisting of a broken mound of earth-work and four corner bastions of great size, surrounded by a ditch fully forty yards wide on the town side. An old temple in the fort still bears traces of the furious cannonade which\nwas thought necessary for the reduction of the place in 1817. The buildings which were left undestroyed are now used as a tahsil. On the north-western outskirts a large and unsightly excavation is being gradually converted into a square tank with masonry steps, and on one side stands the municipal hall, and to the south a school-house with a clock tower, containing a chiming clock, has been built. Besides an ugly temple which was commenced as a dwelling-place there is no striking edifice in the town, which throughout shows nothing but devotion to the acquisition of money. The Hind\u00fas feel the want of water for bathing purposes and it is intended to supply the new tank with water from the canal, which runs at a distance of some ten miles off. A dispensary was built in 1868, and a post-office was finished in 1871. There is a munshi of the first class resident here, who has civil jurisdiction over the tahsil.\n\nThe only point requiring future attention is the unfinished state of the old excavation forming the city ditch to the west and south of the site. This has, of late years, come to be a receptacle for stagnant water and impurities, and could easily be filled up from the excess of earth on the fort mound. The water supply is not good. As a rule, the water of the old wells is brackish, but the water of the Naya bazar and the outskirts tastes well. The water in the wells stands at about 40 to 45 feet from the surface. The Banj\u00e1ras are said to have built, in early times, a stone cenotaph and a well in H\u00e1thras.\n\nH\u00e1thras lies on the route from Agra to Al\u00edgarh.\u20148\u00bd miles from Sadabad station towards Agra, and the same distance from S\u00e1sni, the station between it and Al\u00edgarh. The road all through is metalled and bridged. Between Sadabad and H\u00e1thras, five n\u00e1l\u00e1s are crossed. The country is open and well cultivated. The road passes Bis\u00e1na at 2\u00bd miles, Chandpa at 5 miles, and Mit\u00e1i at 7\u00bd miles. On to S\u00e1sni, the road passes H\u00e1thras at \u00be mile from the encamping-ground, which lies to the south of the town; road to Muttra (distant two marches, or 22 miles) at 1\u00bc; Rohari at 4\u00bd, and Barsa at 7 miles. To Budaon the road (metalled and bridged) passes by Sal\u00edmpur (q.v.). It is intended to construct both a broad gauge railway between the town and the H\u00e1thras Station of the East Indian Railway, now 5\u00bd miles distant from it.\n\nThe Municipal Act has been in force in H\u00e1thras since 1863, and the affairs of the town are now administered by a committee of nine members, of whom three hold office ex-officio and six are elected by the tax-payers. The limits of the municipality have been carefully demarcated by means of stone pillars, and there are seven octroi stations and five police-stations, all built of brick and kunkur. The conservancy of the town is fully provided for by the entertainment of a large staff of sweepers and by the construction of numerous latrines. The Municipal Committee have completed nearly all the important works which are likely to be required for some time.\nThe octroi in 1873-74 fell at Re. 1-1-4 per head of the population.

Even after exempting drugs, spices, vegetables, gums, metals and other similar articles from taxation, and lowering the tax on other goods, the incidence is still abnormally high. The refunds on exports in 1872-73 amounted to Rs. 26,846, and in 1873-74 to Rs. 8,343. The duty on grain has now been reduced to an all-round rate of three pie per maund, whilst sugar has been entirely exempted, for any tax, however small, seems to turn into a mere transit due owing to the great importance of the trade. The exports of coarse sugar in 1872-73 amounted to 87,000 maunds, and in the following year to 84,000, whilst the exports of refined sugar would appear almost to have been to the same amount. Grain of all sorts, oil-seeds, cotton, sugar and ghi are the staple exports, and the imports consist of iron for building purposes, metal vessels of all kinds, cloths both European and native, drugs and spices of all kinds, pedlar's wares, and in fact every article of local consumption in these provinces which are distributed from H\u00e2thras, as the great centre of the supply trade, to all the marts throughout the upper Du\u00e1b, Rohilkhand, and the neighbouring districts of the Panj\u00e1b. Even with the reduced schedule of duty the income will still be quite sufficient for all ordinary expenditure, whilst the check to trade caused by imposts which are vexatious where unnecessary has been practically removed. The opening of the new line of rail to Muttra, in which the municipality has invested a considerable portion of its surplus funds, and the\nbroad gauge line connecting the business portion of the town with the East Indian Railway, must give a considerable impetus to the trade of this town, which, next to Cawnpore, is already the most important commercial centre in the Du\u00e1b. It is also proposed to carry on the light line of railway by Kasganj to Farukhabad.\n\nThe history of H\u00e1thras is the history of the J\u00e1t family of H\u00e1thras which has already been given in the district notice. From History. 1803 to 1817 it was held by Daya R\u00e1m. On the occasion of Holkar's invasion, as well as at other times, Daya R\u00e1m acted with hostility towards the British, and at length his assumption of independence was found so mischievous and alarming, especially in the threatening state of affairs at the commencement of the Marhatta war in 1817, that it was found necessary to dislodge him. Daya R\u00e1m was summoned to surrender his fort and allow it to be dismantled, but trusting in his defences, which were modelled on those of Aligarh, he refused compliance. The town was invested; and on the 23rd of February, 1817, the town-wall was breached and evacuated, and on the 1st of March fire was opened on the fort from forty-five mortars and three breaching batteries. At the close of the same day a magazine in the fort was exploded and caused such destruction of the garrison and buildings that Daya R\u00e1m fled during the night, and H\u00e1thras and the neighbouring fort of Murs\u00e1n were forthwith dismantled. H\u00e1thras remained tranquil during the mutiny of 1857 through the exertions of Chaube Ghans\u00e1n D\u00e1s, a blind pensioned tahsild\u00e1r, who was afterwards murdered by the rebels at Kasganj. After the mutiny of the troops at Aligarh the Europeans fled to H\u00e1thras, and thence, about the 2nd of July, to Agra. It was one of the first places recovered, and owing to the services of Gobind Singh, son of Daya R\u00e1m, who, for his conduct on this occasion and during the operations against the Koil rebels, was rewarded with the grant of several villages and the proprietary right to Koil itself.\n\nH\u00e1thras, a parganah of the Aligarh district, is bounded on the north by parganahs Koil and Akrabad; on the west by parganahs Gorai, Hasangarh, and Murs\u00e1n; on the south by the Muttra District, and on the east by Akraab and Sikandra Rao. According to the census of 1872 this parganah had then a total area of 218 square miles and 67 acres, of which 180 square miles were under cultivation. The area assessed to Government revenue during the same year was 212 square miles, of which 174 square miles were cultivated, 3 square miles were culturable, and 35 square miles were barren. This parganah lies near the watershed of the Du\u00e1b, and may be described as one wide level plain of loam, with no elevations, and not more depressions than are required by the natural drainage of the country. With the exception of a few villages towards Murs\u00e1n and Gorai, there is little\nsandy soil, and no tract of sand as in other parganahs. Here and there are a few fields of gently rising ground, and in a few villages a light soil may prevail, but as a rule the whole is composed of rich, easily workable loam. The Bengar flows through the eastern portion of the parganah, and is used as a canal escape and as a distributary. A considerable area is irrigated in this manner along its banks. There are no other streams in the parganah, and no jhils larger than ponds.\n\nThe previous history of the parganah has been given under that of the Jat talukadars in the notice of the district, and in comparing it with the present settlement statistics note should be taken of the changes in area that have taken place between 1839 and 1868, and which are mentioned hereafter. The net gain to the parganah amounts to 13 villages, but the actual area gained is not ascertainable. The parganah as settled by Mr. Thornton in 1848 contained 206 parent villages and 107 hamlets, including talukas Moudu, K\u00e1ras, Karil, Shahz\u00e9dpur, Gulbr\u00e1ri, Samardhari, and Barha. Mr. Thornton followed the same principles that he had adopted in Murs\u00e1n, that whatever may have been the standing of the talukd\u00e1r, provided it was evident that, from the first, he was a species of Government officer, and that no private transfer of the rights of the original proprietors had taken place in his favour, the descendants of the old proprietors had the first and most undoubted claim to be admitted to engagements on fair and equitable terms. To them also rightly belonged the title of zamind\u00e1r as then understood, \"but, perhaps, it was more suitable to allow them the equivalent designation of biswad\u00e1r as long as the desire of providing for the talakad\u00e1r or other causes interfered with their admission to the same terms as the village zamind\u00e1rs in other places.\" In nearly all these propositions Mr. Thornton carried the people with him, and even the talukadars themselves. He lowered the Government demand by ten per cent. all round. In all cases 20 per cent. was deducted from the net assets as shown in the rental and left with the biswad\u00e1rs, and where the talukadars were recorded as zamind\u00e1rs 30 per cent. was allowed to them.\u00b9 In biswad\u00e1ri villages the talukadars' allowance or malik\u00e1na was fixed at 18 per cent. on the rental, giving a total reduction of 38 per cent. on the rental assets. Mr. Thornton settled all the disputes that he found to exist, and made arrangements as far as he could for clearing off the old liabilities of the landholders. His action in these matters is so different from that adopted at the present day that it deserves careful study and notice. The village communities had been so shattered and injured that in many cases he had to reconstruct them from the foundation. Before allowing that reduction of the land-revenue which he found necessary for the welfare of the village proprietary body, he examined into their liabilities, and arranged terms with the money-lenders, by which the usufruct of a certain\n\n\u00b9 See Set. Rep., I, 881, and Re. Rep., II, N.S., 49.\nterm of years was held sufficient to clear off the whole mortgage. As far as he could he \"rescued the village zamindars from their former hopeless state, and gave them the power by future prudence and industry of recovering from all their embarrassments.\" In furtherance of this object he procured from Government a compensation to the talukadars of Mendu and Shalzadpur in exchange for a formal release by them of all debts due from the biswadars in their talukas. The talukadars themselves were not forgotten in this scheme of relief. The entire debts due by them, and indeed the whole balance due from the parganah, was remitted as irrecoverable, and thus H\u00e2thras started afresh into life.\n\nNotwithstanding all these efforts to place matters in H\u00e2thras on a more satisfactory footing, the success obtained has been very small. Certainly great difficulties had to be encountered. The former settlements were framed on the excessive assessments which had been levied by the talukadars, but the farming system adopted by these men had already led to the total disruption of all ties connected with the village community. Many of the old proprietary body were often obliged to bid higher than the actual outturn to secure possession of their ancestral lands and prevent the intrusion of a stranger; hence the abnormally high rates of the old settlements. Mr. Thornton reduced these assessments by ten per cent., and had to explain his reasons for this reduction by showing that even then the village zamindars paid Rs. 3-3-6 per cultivated acre. Still these reductions were not enough. It was found necessary in 1851-53 to allow remissions amounting to Rs. 18,420, and in 1855 again Rs. 22,693 were remitted. The greater part of the changes affecting the area took place in 1840, when taluka S\u00e2sani was received from Murs\u00e2n, and certain villages from Jal\u00e2li and Akabad, all assessed at 75 per cent. of the assets. The indebtedness of the landholders is said by Mr. Wright to have amounted to not less than twelve lakhs of rupees (in 1839), of which nine were commercial debts due to the great indigo factories of Mendu; H\u00e2thras, S\u00e2sani, and Jo\u00e2r, and three were for arrears of land-revenue. He writes:\u2014\"The wells have gone to decay, and the utter hopelessness of the people of escaping from their creditors has caused general neglect as to their restoration, and thus the chief means of paying the revenue has failed. The present demand is not excessive, and any difficulties in the way of collecting it must be attributed to other causes than a heavy rate of assessment.\" Bad seasons had something to say to this state of affairs as well as of the assessment.\n\nTaking the results of the assessment during its entire term as shown by transfers between 1839 transfers by revenue process of rights and interests in and 1848. land in the parganah, the figures are as follows on a total area amounting to 136,168 acres and assessed at Rs. 3,08,344.\n18\u00b76 per cent. of these transfers occurred during the first ten years of Mr. Thornton's settlement, 1\u00b759 per cent. during the second ten years, and only 0\u00b734 per cent. between 1859 and 1868. But the voluntary sales and transfers by order of the Civil Courts show a total revolution in the proprietary body, for which it is difficult to find a parallel in these provinces. The statistics are as follows:\n\n| Area | Land-revenue | Percentage of area | Percentage of land-revenue |\n|------|--------------|--------------------|---------------------------|\n| Sold privately | 54,858 | 1,27,189 | 40\u00b727 | 41\u00b722 |\n| Mortgaged | 52,370 | 1,19,909 | 39\u00b738 | 38\u00b785 |\n| Auction | 49,666 | 1,18,961 | 36\u00b747 | 36\u00b795 |\n| Total | 156,794 | 3,60,999 | 116\u00b712 | 117\u00b705 |\n\nNearly 60 per cent. of this changed hands during the first ten years, 31\u00b73 per cent. during the second ten years, and 29\u00b77 per cent. during the last decade. In the whole parganah an area exceeding the total area by 15 per cent. changed hands by voluntary or forced sale in addition to the 20\u00b76 per cent. transferred by revenue processes. So severe was the assessment that between 1889 and 1852 land fetched only one and a half times the Government demand, and the percentage of transfers to area show that the purchasers only held the land for a short time, and gladly allowed new speculators to come in. This was especially the case during the first decade, when nearly 79 per cent. of the entire transfers took place. In H\u00e1thras 13,874 acres, or 10\u00b71 per cent. of the total area, has been temporarily transferred from the original proprietors by mortgage, and 1,506 acres, or 1\u00b71 per cent., by farm. The permanent alienations from the old proprietary body amount to 76,548 acres, or 56\u00b72 per cent. of the entire area, leaving only 44,220 acres, or 32\u00b72 per cent. of the total area, in the hands of those whose families possessed it in 1888. Rajputs, Jats, Brahmins, and Kuiras have been the principal losers, and the money-lenders of H\u00e1thras, S\u00e1uni, and Koil have stepped into their places. It would appear that the benevolent\nintentions of Mr. Thornton were frustrated by their very character. His arrangements gave a heritable and transferable value to the land which it never had before. The progress of the settlement and its duration combined with the increase of population, the rise in prices and the introduction of the canal, enhanced this value. Old debts, especially those due to the indigo factories, and which were before the settlement not worth one anna in the rupee, were eagerly bought up and enforced against the land. Taking the Rajputs alone, they have lost 50,660 acres out of 60,537 acres held by them at the commencement of the last settlement. The Porach clan, once lords of Mendu, H\u00e1thras, and Daryapur, now have only 1,346 acres. Bh\u00e1ts have saved only one out of 25 villages held by them in 1888. Bangars have disappeared altogether, and Gahlots only retain 1,542 out of 11,726 acres. The J\u00e1ts, amongst whom must be reckoned Raja Tikam Singh, have retained only 61 per cent. of their old possessions. Kir\u00e1rs, though very industrious, have not preserved one-half of their lands, and Brahmins have lost 65 per cent. of their old shares. Out of 242 villages 218 were held by these four castes.\n\nThe following statement will show more clearly the individual loss to each caste; the column for mortgage includes 1,115 acres belonging to Th\u00e1kurs which were confiscated for rebellion and 1,526 acres farmed for arrears of revenue:\n\n| Caste       | Area held in 1888 | Lost between 1838 and 1888 by Sale | Mortgage | Total | Remaining |\n|-------------|-------------------|------------------------------------|----------|-------|-----------|\n| Orh         | 269               | ...                                | 269      | ...   |           |\n| European    | 744               | ...                                | 744      | ...   |           |\n| Ahir        | 664               | ...                                | 664      | ...   |           |\n| Brahman     | 20,976            | 11,018                             | 2,763    | 15,781| 7,195     |\n| Th\u00e1kur      | 60,537            | 39,839                             | 10,821   | 50,660| 9,877     |\n| J\u00e1t         | 32,128            | 11,355                             | 1,101    | 12,474| 19,654    |\n| Baniya      | 1,452             | 952                                | 396      | 1,848 | 104       |\n| Cham\u00e1r      | 888               | 828                                | 45       | 868   | ...       |\n| K\u00e1yath      | 1,976             | 819                                | 83       | 401   | 1,575     |\n| Kir\u00e1r       | 10,437            | 5,108                              | 1,004    | 6,112 | 4,325     |\n| Khatik      | 260               | 260                                | ...      | 260   | ...       |\n| Lodha       | 261               | 149                                | 16       | 165   | 95        |\n| Mew\u00e1ti      | 268               | 151                                | 53       | 304   | 54        |\n| Na-n-m u-s-lim | 3,857          | 3,068                              | 195      | 3,281 | 576       |\n| Musalm\u00e1n    | 1,481             | 686                                | 31       | 717   | 764       |\n\nTotal: 196,168 75,483 16,515 91,948 44,230\n\nThe new settlement was made in 1872 by Mr. W. H. Smith. The statistics of area then collected show that the total area amounted to 139,345 acres, of\nwhich 19,583 acres were returned as barren and 5,781 acres were held free of revenue. The distribution of the assessable area was as follows:\n\n| Culturable | Cultivated |\n|------------|------------|\n| New fallow | Old waste  |\n| Acres      | Acres      |\n| 970        | 4,779      |\n| Grove      | Total      |\n| Acres      | Acres      |\n| 6,266      | 100,161    |\n| Total      | DRY.       |\n| Acres      | Acres      |\n| 107,717    | 7,556      |\n| Grand Total| Acres      |\n|            | 1,13,991   |\n\nThe proportion of culturable land to the total area is 82 per cent., and of cultivation to the culturable area is 95 per cent., whilst irrigation reaches the enormous proportion of 93 per cent. of the cultivated area. The area available for the increase of cultivation in this parganah, even including grove-land, is only five per cent., so that here, if in any parganah in these provinces, all the conditions precedent to the grant of a permanent settlement exist. Cultivation has increased by 3-36 per cent., and irrigation by 15-9 per cent., since last settlement. The new assessment of the land-revenue amounts to Rs. 3,11,635-4-0 and the cesses to Rs. 31,163-8-0. H\u00e1thras has but 2-5 per cent. of unirrigated sand, and very little of the irrigated area is sandy. The old revenue of the parganah as it now stands was Rs. 2,96,542, which rose to Rs. 3,02,226 when the present assessment commenced, whilst the new land-revenue shews an increase of three per cent. on the expiring land-revenue of the past settlement. Of the 265 mah\u00e1ls or estates in the parganah in 1872, two were held free of revenue, 132 were held on a zamind\u00e1ri tenure, 6 were pattid\u00e1ri, and 125 were bh\u00e1yach\u00e1ra; 18-1 per cent. of the revenue is paid by owners holding more than one village, 32-6 per cent. by villages where there are not more than six co-sharers, and 49-3 per cent. by villages in which the sharers are numerous. The rabi crops cover 47 per cent. of the total cultivated area, and amongst them wheat occupies 18 per cent., barley 12 per cent., and bejar 7 per cent. Amongst the kharif crops, cotton occupies 15-5 per cent. of the total cultivation, j\u00f3r 21-5 per cent., bdj\u00e1ra 6 per cent., and indigo 4 per cent. 1,134 holdings are recorded as the seer of proprietors, 2,943 as held by hereditary tenants, and 5,223 by tenants-at-will, or 12-9 per cent., 31-3 per cent., and 55-7 per cent., of the total cultivated area respectively. The average area of each proprietary holding is 12'5 acres. Tenants occupy 87 per cent. of the cultivated area, and with the exception of the Raja the landowners are mostly absentees. The average rent paid by hereditary tenants is Rs. 5-1-8 per acre, and by tenants-at-will Rs. 4-12-7, or together Rs. 4-14-8. In H\u00e1thras 14,258 cultivated acres are entered as seer of proprietors, 34,554 acres as held by hereditary tenants, and 61,580 acres as held by tenants-at-will.\nAccording to the census of 1872 parganah H\u00e2thras contained 241 inhabited villages, of which 53 had less than 200 inhabitants; 93 had between 200 and 500; 62 had between 500 and 1,000; 28 had between 1,000 and 2,000; and four had between 2,000 and 3,000. The only town containing more than 5,000 inhabitants is H\u00e2thras itself.\n\nThe settlement records show that there were 244 villages in 1872, distributed amongst 257 mah\u00e2ls or estates. The average area of each village was 576 acres.\n\nThe total population in 1872 numbered 159,834 souls (74,035 females), giving 733 to the square mile. Classified according to religion, there were 145,687 Hind\u00fbs, of whom 67,521 were females, and 14,147 Musalm\u00e2ns, amongst whom 6,514 were females. Distributing the Hind\u00fb population amongst the four great classes, the census shows 27,551 Brahmins, of whom 12,571 were females; 17,094 Rajputs, including 7,558 females; 11,739 Baniyas (5,581 females); whilst the great mass of the population is included in \"the other castes\" of the census returns, which show a total of 89,303 souls, of whom 41,787 are females.\n\nThe principal Brahman subdivisions found in this parganah are the Gaur (1,844), Saraswat (905), Sam\u00e2dh (3,439), and Kanaujiya. Rajputs are of the Gahlot (1,332), Chauhan (573), Badgudjar, Jadon (2,298), Jangh\u00e2ra, Gaur, Pundir, Rathor, Panw\u00e2r, Bh\u00e2l, S\u00eekharw\u00e2r, Galharw\u00e2r, Jarauliya, Raikw\u00e2r, Khaj\u00e2ri, Kir\u00e2r, and Surajbansi clans; whilst Baniyas belong to the Agarw\u00e2l (3,668), Chaussini, D\u00e2sa, Maheri, B\u00e2rahassini (3,990), Khandelw\u00e2l, Gurw\u00e2l, Jaisw\u00e2r, and Sarangi subdivisions. Amongst the other castes the following have more than one thousand members:\u2014J\u00e2t (5,880), Son\u00e2r, Barhai (3,957), Hajj\u00e2m (3,707), Kal\u00e2l (2,123), Kachhi (6,103), Darzi, Kab\u00e2r, Jog\u00ee, Dhobi, Koli (6,264), Cham\u00e2r (30,192), Khatik, Kh\u00e2krob (3,601), Kumb\u00e2r, Garariya, Aheriya, K\u00e2yath, and Dh\u00e2na. The following have between one hundred and one thousand members each:\u2014R\u00e2j, M\u00e2li, Bh\u00e2t, Gosha\u00een, Ah\u00eer, Joshi, Bairagi, Loh\u00e2r, Banj\u00e2ra, Bharbh\u00e2nja, Lodha, Mall\u00e2h, Teli, Kanjar, and Chhipi. The Musalm\u00e2ns belong to the Shaikh (2,381), Sayyid (346), Mughal (78), and Path\u00e2n (1,218) subdivisions. The remainder of the Muhammadan population is entered without distinction.\n\nThe occupations of the people are shown in the statistics collected at the census of 1872. From these it appears that of the male adult population (not less than fifteen years of age) 914 are employed in professional avocations, such as Government servants, priests, doctors, and the like; 7,337 in domestic service, as personal servants, water-carriers, barbers, sweepers, washermen, &c.; 4,558 in commerce, in buying, selling, keeping or lending money or goods, or the conveyance of men, animals, or goods; 19,045 in agricultural operations; 8,895 in industrial occupations, arts and mechanics, and the preparation of all classes of substances, vegetable, mineral, and animal. There were 11,983 persons returned as\nlabourers and 1,466 as of no specified occupation. Taking the total population, irrespective of age or sex, the same returns give 3,580 as landholders, 49,278 as cultivators, and 1,06,976 as engaged in occupations unconnected with agriculture. The educational statistics, which are confessedly imperfect, show 4,112 males as able to read and write out of a total male population numbering 85,799 souls. Parganah H\u00e2thras was formed out of parganahs Sadabad, Mah\u00e2ban, Jalesar, and Koil during the last century, and varied in size up to 1838. It then contained 220 villages, with a cultivated area amounting to 93,104 acres and a land-revenue of Rs. 2,62,168. Between 1839 and 1868, 43 villages were transferred to Igl\u00e2s, 17 to Murs\u00e2n, 3 to the Muttra district, and 4 to Sikandra Rao. During the same period 28 villages (taluka S\u00e2sni) were received from Jal\u00e2li, 44 (taluka Moheriya) from Murs\u00e2n, 4 from the Muttra district, and 4 from Akrabad, whilst one village (Dariyspur) was divided into twelve villages.\n\nH\u00e2thras, a tahsil of the Aligarh district, comprises the parganahs of H\u00e2thras and Murs\u00e2n. The settlement records show a total area of 185,952 acres, of which 9,317 acres are held free of revenue and 28,097 acres were barren. The assessable area comprised 154,538 acres, of which 146,633 acres were cultivated (135,912 acres irrigated) and 7,916 acres were culturable; of the latter 554 acres were under groves. The percentage of the culturable land to the total area is 88 per cent.; of cultivation to the culturable area is 95 per cent., and of irrigation to cultivation is 93 per cent. The old land-revenue stood at Rs. 3,91,751, falling at Rs. 2-11-5 on the cultivation, and the new assessment is Rs. 4,18,525, falling at Rs. 2-13-8 per cultivated acre, and giving a rise of 6-8 per cent. over the initial demand of the old settlement and of 5 per cent. over its expiring demand. The population in 1872 numbered 207,330 souls (95,911 females), giving 715 souls to the square mile. Excluding the city of H\u00e2thras the density is 635 souls to the square mile. There are 370 inhabited villages in the tahsil. The total number of villages is 386, with an average area of 481 acres, or 0'751 square mile to each village. In 1872 the villages were distributed amongst 408 mah\u00e2ls or estates, of which 11 are held free of revenue, 208 are of the class known as zam\u00eend\u00e2ri, 6 are pat\u00ee-d\u00e2ri, and 183 are bh\u00e2yach\u00e2ra, so that, roughly speaking, one-half of the tahsil is pretty minutely subdivided amongst cultivating village communities, and one-half is held by large proprietors. The census statistics show 534 blind persons, 34 lepers, 47 deaf and dumb, 21 idiots, and 15 insane persons in the tahsil.\n\nThe tahsil is remarkable for the high standard it has reached. Out of the total area 83 per cent. is culturable, and of this 95 per cent. is actually cultivated, whilst irrigation reaches 93 per cent. of the cultivated area. The proportion\n\n---\n\n1 Many changes have taken place; thus Rs. 6,000 have been alienated to the Murs\u00e2n Raja for two generations, and there has been a large increase.\nof culturable waste still remaining uncultivated, even including grove-land, is only five per cent., not enough for pasture and firewood. The consequence is that a yearly increasing portion of the cultivated area is being devoted to inferior fodder crops. Irrigation and cultivation have almost reached their maximum, population is dense, labour is abundant and in great demand, and great pains are bestowed on husbandry. 86 per cent. of the cultivated area is watered from wells, in which the water is found at a depth averaging from 26 to 28 feet from the surface. The crops follow the character of the cultivation. In the year of remeasurement cotton covered 15 per cent. of the cultivated area, joda 21.5 per cent., wheat 17 per cent., and barley and bajar together 20.5 per cent. In natural capabilities H\u00e2thras is unequalled in the district.\n\nHarduaganj or Hardewaganj, a town in parganah Koil of the Aligarh district, is distant six miles east from Aligarh. The population in 1848 was 5,942, in 1853 there were 8,292 inhabitants, and in 1865 there were 6,120. In 1872 the population numbered 6,970 souls, of whom 6,353 were Hind\u00fbs (3,127 females) and 617 were Mussalmans (275 females). The town site occupies 80 square acres, giving 87 souls to the acre. All persons residing beyond the limits of the municipality were excluded from the census of 1872. The residents are chiefly Baniyas engaged in trade, and who occupy the brick-built houses in the eastern quarter of the town. The town clusters around the ganj in a long and narrow strip to the east and west, and is connected with the R\u00e2mg\u00e2t and Aligarh metalled road by four roads, also made and drained. The ganj is a fine open bazarway lined with fair shops built of brick, and widens out on the south into a large circular space. The ganj itself is fairly raised, but elsewhere the town site where not level is depressed, especially on the west. During the rains the water overflows the site both towards the east and the west, and flows southwards towards a great jhil about three miles off towards the head-waters of the Sengar. The R\u00e2mpur Station of the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway, called in the traffic tables Harduaganj, is three miles north of the town, and hitherto the rail traffic passes by Aligarh. There is a police-station, a post-office, and a school, none of which deserve any particular notice. Nearly all the town lands are irrigated by the canal, and since its introduction the water in wells has risen from 25 feet to only 10 feet from the surface. Fevers are common.\n\nThe municipality was established in 1865, and is now managed by a committee of nine members, of whom three are official, three are elected by the tax-payers, and three are nominated by the Magistrate. The incidence of taxation in 1865 was 9 annas 9 pie per head of the population. It is the only town much affected by canal traffic. It lies just a mile from Barauta bridge, and is the nearest town of any size to the canal. The chief imports are salt, timber, and bambus, and the chief exports are cotton.\nand grain. In 1860-61 a large amount of grain was imported by the canal from Cawnpore. The following table gives the receipts and expenditure of the municipality for three years:\n\n| Receipts | 1870-71 | 1871-72 | 1872-73 |\n|----------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Rs.      | Rs.     | Rs.     | Rs.     |\n\n| Expenditure | 1870-71 | 1871-72 | 1872-73 |\n|-------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Rs.         | Rs.     | Rs.     | Rs.     |\n\nThe following statement gives the value of the imports for two years:\n\nNet imports.\n\n| Articles | Value, 1871-72 | Value, 1872-73 | Quantity, 1871-72 | Consumption per Head, 1871-72 |\n|----------|----------------|----------------|--------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Grain    | 87,795         | 59,710         | 38,065             | 7 18 9                        |\n| Sugar    | 31,738         | 51,788         | 9,201              | 1 41 1                        |\n| Ghi      | 3,996          | 11,639         | 582                | 0 4 8                         |\n| Vegetables | 5,755       | 9,994          | 3,737              |                               |\n| Fodder   | 1,885          | 2,979          | 4,995              |                               |\n| P\u00e1n      | 1,337          | 293            | 1,173              |                               |\n| Oil      | 5,710          | 5,791          | 681                | 0 5 4                         |\n| Oil-seeds| 2,061          | 979            | 0 7 6              |                               |\n\nHardusaganj is said to owe its origin to Hardeva or B\u00e1l\u00e1r\u00e1ma, the brother of Krishna, whose name is also connected with Koil and with R\u00e1mgh\u00e1t in the Bulandshahr district. The Y\u00e1davas of B\u00e1l\u00e1r\u00e1ma's party were accompanied by an auxiliary force of Ahira, whose commander, Chiman, excavated the tank in the present town of Hardusaganj. On the conquest of Dehli by the Muhammadans, a colony of refugees\nChauh\u00e1ns took up their quarters here and got possession of the neighbouring country. There is no building and no remains of any antiquity about the town, which was plundered during the mutiny by the villagers of the neighbourhood, and property estimated to be worth four lakhs of rupees was stolen or destroyed. In the last century Hardwaiganj was patronised by Naw\u00e1b S\u00e1bit Kh\u00e1n, who improved the town very much and encouraged the settlement of traders in it.\n\nHusain, a town in parganah Sikandra of the Aligarh district, is distant 22 miles from Aligarh and 8 miles from Sikandra. The population in 1865 was 2,588, and in 1872 there were 3,164 inhabitants. The Chaukid\u00e1ri Act (XX. of 1856) is in force in Husain, and in 1873 supported a village police numbering nine men of all grades at an annual cost of Rs. 528. The number of the houses in the town in 1872-73 was 730, and of these 658 were assessed with a house-tax averaging Re. 1-8 1 per house and Re. 0-4-10 per head of the population per annum. The income for the same year was Rs. 1,011, including a balance of Rs. 28 from the previous year, and the expenditure was Rs. 829. Hussain gave its name to a Porach taluka which has since been absorbed in parganah Sikandra Rao.\n\nIgl\u00e1s or Agil\u00e1s, a tahsili town in parganah and tahsil Igl\u00e1s of the Aligarh district, is situated on the Muttra road, 18 miles from Aligarh and 8 miles from Besw\u00e1u. The population in 1865 was 1,310, and in 1872 there were 1,491 inhabitants. It is the head-quarters of the tahsil, and possesses a police-station and post-office. Unconnected with the public offices, Igl\u00e1s is of no importance whatever, and is a mere agricultural village. The Chaukid\u00e1ri Act (XX. of 1856) is in force in Igl\u00e1s, and in 1873 supported a village police numbering three men of all grades at an annual cost of Rs. 162. The number of the houses in the town in 1872-73 was 289, and of these 240 were assessed with a house-tax averaging Re. 0-15-1 per house and Re. 0-2-5 per head of the population per annum. The income for the same year was Rs. 298, including a balance of Rs. 70 from the previous year, and the expenditure was Rs. 287. In 1857 the J\u00e1ts of the parganah attacked the tahsil of Igl\u00e1s, which was protected by Burton's troopers and guns from S\u00e1ani. The J\u00e1ts attempted to seize the guns, but a shower of rain put out their matches (pall\u00e1s), and a charge of cavalry utterly overthrew and scattered them in all directions.\n\nIgl\u00e1s, a tahsil in the Aligarh district, comprises parganahs Hasangarh and Gorai. According to the settlement records the total area in 1874 contained 186,568 acres, of which 2,165 acres were held free of revenue and 9,825 acres were barren. The assessable area comprised 124,758 acres, of which 117,497 acres were cultivated and 7,081 acres were culturable. Of the cultivated area 89,522 acres were irrigated, and of the culturable area 122 acres were under groves. The proportion of culturable land to the total area is 91 per cent., of cultivation to the culturable area is 94 per cent., and of irrigation to cultivation\nis 76 per cent. Six per cent. of the culturable area is untilled, and this small margin hardly suffices for grazing purposes. In 1872 the population numbered 114,665 souls (52,226 females), giving 536 souls to the square mile, distributed amongst 212 inhabited villages. The census statistics show 643 persons blind, 28 lepers, 19 deaf and dumb, 4 idiots, and 10 insane persons in the tahsil. The new assessment amounts to Rs. 2,87,694, and the cesses to 28,769, or a total of Rs. 3,16,463. The incidence of the old land-revenue was Rs. 2-5-4 per acre of cultivation, and of the new revenue is Rs. 2-7-2, giving an increase in the land-revenue of Rs. 22,703, or 8-5 per cent. The percentage of increase in the different portions of the tahsil varies very much (2 to 31 per cent.), owing to the percentages on which the former revenue was cultivated, having varied from 58 to 80 per cent. of the rental assets. The uniform rate of 50 per cent. of the assets has now been applied to all villages, and the incidence of the State demand has been thus equalised.\n\nThe only poor tract is in talukas Jo\u00e1r and Barha, where the sand is yellow and rises into high ridges, and the sub-soil is not favourable to well-making. The industrious J\u00e2ts are good cultivators, and over 14 per cent. of the cultivated area is manured. They have also increased the number of hamlets in their villages, and thus enlarged the area of the better classes of land. Irrigation is from wells, and three-fourths of it from earthen wells; it reaches 76 per cent. of the cultivated area. Of the same area 23 per cent. is under wheat, 14 per cent. under cotton, barley 5 per cent., gram 8 per cent., bajra 8 per cent., and 17 per cent. is under jo\u00e1r. These crops show the natural fertility of the soil, and in the whole tahsil there is only six per cent. of the culturable area uncultivated. The agricultural classes are chiefly J\u00e2ts of the Tenwa and Thakurel gots, who are especially good cultivators, so that there is little left to desire in the prosperity of this tract. At the recent settlement the malik\u00e2na allowances have been reduced from 30 and 22-5 per cent. on the land-revenue to a uniform allowance of 10 per cent., and thus though enhancement of the revenue has taken place in many cases, the general result has been a relief to the overburdened biswad\u00e2ri villages. Throughout the tahsil, while the increase in the Government demand has been 7 per cent. in malik\u00e2na villages, the actual increase in the payments made by the village proprietors has been only 4 per cent., owing to the fact that they now only pay Rs. 4,984, instead of Rs. 12,671, as the taluka-d\u00e2r's allowance. It would be well, should opportunity offer, that Government should buy out these abnormal middlemen and consolidate the malik\u00e2na and revenue as one charge on the biswad\u00e2ri estates.\n\nThe tract comprising the tahsil contains no natural boundaries. It is a long strip of varying width, running from north to south, and forms a small portion of a section of the Du\u00e1b, which to the east is continued in the same form in Koil and H\u00e2thras, and to the west in Muttra. Undulating ridges of\nsand may be traced in three parallel bands of irregular size and form from north to south. Between these ridges are lowlying level plains of loam, interspersed with patches of sand formed by a continuation of the main ridges in the form of spurs thrown out laterally, so that there are few villages which do not contain soils of both kinds. The Karwan Nadi runs through the centre of both parganahs and forms the drainage line. It is dry during a great portion of the year, and its bed is cultivated during the hot weather. The land on each side being low is always of the best quality, though here and there the sandy hills approach to within a few hundred feet of the bank. To the west the lowlying tract is wider than elsewhere and continues on into the Muttra district. No sandy ridges or other offshoots run into this tract from the west, and the eastern ridges are more distant than elsewhere. To the east the ridges are wider and continue on into Koil and H\u00e1thras, so that, on the whole, the eastern side of the tahsil is of inferior fertility to the western. The soil of both tracts is good, and the loam and sand to the west are as productive as any other soils of that class in the district. The natural capabilities for irrigation are excellent. Water is found at a depth of 20 to 30 feet from the surface, and the subsoil is so firm that earthen wells will stand for years with only a brushwood frame, and for many years with a wooden frame, costing from Rs. 20 to 50. The wells are all fed from springs, not from percolation.\n\nJal\u00e1l\u00ed, a town in parganah and tahsil Koil of the Aligarh district, is situated close to the East K\u00e1li Nadi on the K\u00e1sganj road, 11 miles southeast of Aligarh. The population in 1853 numbered 6,599 souls, and in 1865 there were 6,155. In 1872 there were 7,480 inhabitants, of whom 4,689 were Hind\u00fa (2,153 females) and 2,791 were Musalm\u00e1ns (1,400 females). The site of the town occupies 58 square acres, giving 129 souls to the acre. The most noteworthy inhabitants are the Sayyids, descendants of one Kam\u00e1l-ud-d\u00edn, who settled in the town during the reign of Ala-ud-d\u00edn Muhammad Shah (1295 A.D.) Kam\u00e1l-ud-d\u00edn married the daughter of the K\u00e1zi, and during the reign of Sh\u00e1bjah\u00e1n his descendants were powerful enough to expel the old Path\u00e1n landholders, and thus obtained the full proprietary rights in the town which they still possess. \"These rights have since become so subdivided that the individual shares are scarcely worth retaining. The reputation of the family is due to their having given so many useful subordinate officers to the British Government. Among its co-sharers the village can boast of an exceptionally numerous body of men who have obtained, or are now obtaining, distinction in both the military and civil services. On the one hand Ris\u00e1ld\u00e1r Majors, Ris\u00e1ld\u00e1rs, Subahd\u00e1rs; on the other hand, Sadr Amins, Muns\u00edfs, Deputy Collectors, and Tah\u00e1ld\u00e1rs, besides innumerable subordinate servants of the State, abound among the members of this comparatively small proprietary community.\" The Sayyids are of the Shiah sect, and are noted as the leading members of that\ndivision of Muhammadians in the upper Du\u00e1b. Maulvi Mukarram Husain lives here and preaches every Friday in the principal mosque to large congregations of attentive listeners. Altogether there is no town in the district possessing such an influential and energetic colony of Musalmans.\n\nThere is little remarkable in the situation of the town beyond its isolation. It has no good roads, and lies between two high raised r\u00e9jibahas of the Ganges Canal. The site also is high, and presents a curious appearance from the large number of im\u00e1mb\u00e1r\u00e1s interspersed amidst the houses. There are upwards of eighty of these structures devoted to Musalm\u00e1n worship, of which thirty are of a good size, and one is a fine building. The ways are narrow, tortuous and unmetalled, and to the west there are several large excavations charged with water which becomes stagnant during the cold weather. To the west and south the land is low, and the road there is raised, but unmade. There is no regular bazar, and no trade. There is no Government school in the town, but there are four schools where the Kor\u00e1n is taught. The town is essentially an agricultural one, comprising a cluster of villages inhabited by landholders and cultivators, and this character is borne out by the number of cattle one sees coming into it of an evening. The well-water has risen from 42 feet from the surface to 30 feet since the opening of the canal, but its quality has not deteriorated. The Chaukid\u00e1ri Act (XX. of 1856) is in force, and in 1872-73 supported a village police numbering 13 men of all grades at an annual cost of Rs. 744. The number of houses in the town is 1,447, and of these 1,309 were assessed with a tax averaging Re. 1-0-5 per house and Re. 0-2-10 per head of the population per annum. The income for the year 1872-73 amounted to Rs. 1,519, including a balance of Rs. 180 from the previous year, and the expenditure was Rs. 1,279. Though a staff of four sweepers is entertained, the condition of the town is extremely filthy, and nothing appears to be done by the local committee towards improving it. On the east is a hollow called the pokkar, in which the rainfall collects, but its natural outfall has been cut off by the r\u00e9jibaha, and it now overflows and causes considerable damage. What is most wanted is a good road connecting it with the Aligarh road and an enforcement of sanitary rules.\n\nJal\u00e1l\u00ed lies on the route from Aligarh by K\u00e1sganj and Kachila Gh\u00e1t to Budamaun, 14\u00bd miles from Aligarh and 11\u00bd miles from Gangiri, the next stage. From Koil to Jal\u00e1l\u00ed the road is metalled and bridged. It leaves the Grand Trunk Road at Panehti (302\u00bd miles from Allahabad), 7\u00bd miles; passes Allahd\u00e1dpur, 7\u00bd miles, from the Ganges Canal by a bridge, 10\u00bd miles. The encamping-ground is about half a mile from the town of Jal\u00e1l\u00ed, whence supplies are procurable after due notice. Hence to Gangiri the road is metalled as far as Ka\u00fariyaganj, 2\u00bd miles, and beyond that is unmetalled; passes Shahgarh and the East K\u00e1li N\u00e1di by a bridge at Haidar\u00e1ma\u00ed, 7\u00bd\nThe country open and cultivated. Jal\u00e1li gave its name to an old parganah which was absorbed in the neighbouring parganahs in 1862-63; 32 villages belonging to parganah Jal\u00e1li were transferred to parganah Koil, 38 villages to parganah H\u00e1thras, and 29 villages to parganah Atrauli.\n\nLocal tradition makes the foundation of Jal\u00e1li to precede that of Koil itself.\n\nHistory.\n\nThe story is given in the history of the district, and need not be repeated here (page 484). It was then called Nilanti. It must have fallen into ruins, for it is said to have been rebuilt by Jal\u00e1l-ud-din Fir\u00faz Sh\u00e1h during the reign of Gh\u00e1ias-ud-d\u00edn Balban, who erected the minar at Koil. A mosque still exists here bearing an inscription dated in 665 Hijri (1266-67 A.D.) Jal\u00e1l-ud-din called the town after his own name and settled here a colony of Path\u00e1ns. Previously (in 1242 A.D.) Ulugh Kh\u00e1n was obliged to lead a large force to chastise \"the rebels of Jal\u00e1li and Dewali and the Mawas of the D\u00fa\u00e1b between the Ganges and the Jumna. He fought much against the infidels and cleared the roads and the neighbouring country from insurgents.\" For a short time Jal\u00e1li formed a portion of the kingdom of Jaunpur and was occupied by the Jaunpur troops. In the time of Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1n the Path\u00e1ns were ousted by the Sayyids, who are still in possession.\u00b9\n\nJARAUULI, a town in parganah Akrabad of the Aligarh district, is distant 12 miles from Sikandra and 11 miles from Aligarh. In 1865 there were 2,050 inhabitants, and in 1872 there were 2,366.\n\nJAT\u00c1RI, a town in parganah Tappal of the Aligarh district, is distant 27 miles from Aligarh and 13 miles from Khair. The population in 1865 numbered 2,011 souls, and in 1872 there were 2,281 inhabitants. The Chawkid\u00e1ri Act (XX. of 1856) is in force in Jat\u00e1ri, and in 1873 supported a village police numbering six men of all grades at an annual cost of Rs. 342. The number of the houses in the town in 1872-3 was 494, and of these 451 were assessed with a house-tax averaging Re. 1-1-4 per house and Re. 0-3-6 per head of the population per annum. The income for the same year was Rs. 629, including a balance of Rs. 139 from the previous year, and the expenditure was Rs. 591.\n\nJAWA, a village in parganah Keil of the Aligarh district, is distant 14 miles from Aligarh. The population in 1865 was 1,194, and in 1872 was 1,420. There is a police-station and a post-office here. Jawa lies on the road by An\u00fapsahr to Budson, and is distant 9\u00bd miles from Aligarh and 13\u00bd miles from D\u00e1npur. The road is metalled and bridged throughout, and passes Ch\u00edrat at 5\u00bd miles from Aligarh. Hence to D\u00e1npur crosses the Ganges Canal by a bridge at one mile, passes T\u00e1jpur at 1\u00bd, the district boundary at 2\u00bd, the East K\u00e1li Nadi by a bridge at 7\u00bd, and Nar\u00e1yanpur at 11\u00bd miles. Jawa is a mere village, but supplies (after notice) and water are plentiful.\n\n\u00b9 Dowson's Rillot, II., 365, V., 74, 79, 89.\nKACHAURA, a town in parganah Sikandra of the Aligarh district, is distant 30 miles from Aligarh and 6 miles from Sikandra. The population in 1865 was 3,384, and in 1872 there were 3,911 inhabitants. Kachaura is noted for the defence made by the fort in 1803, when the gallant Nairn was slain in the assault. The Chaukidari Act (XX. of 1856) is in force in Kachaura, and in 1873 supported a village police numbering 10 men of all grades at an annual cost of Rs. 582. The number of the houses in the town in 1872-3 was 759, and of these 609 were assessed with a house tax averaging Rs. 1-2-7 per house and Re. 0-2-11 per head of the population per annum. The income for the same year was Rs. 764, including a balance of Rs. 56 from the previous year, and the expenditure was Rs. 763.\n\nKAURIYAGANJ, a town in parganah Akrabad of the Aligarh district, is distant 12 miles from Aligarh and 12 miles from Sikandra. The population in 1865 was 3,607, and in 1872 there were 3,852 inhabitants. The Chaukidari Act (XX. of 1856) is in force in Kauriyaganj, and in 1873 supported a village police numbering 9 men of all grades, at an annual cost of Rs. 528. The number of the houses in the town in 1872-73 was 768, and of these 728 were assessed with a house-tax averaging Re. 0-15-9 per house and Re. 0-3-0 per head of the population per annum. The income for the same year was Rs. 918, including a balance of Rs. 198 from the previous year, and the expenditure was Rs. 765. Kauriyaganj was founded by an Amil of the Oudh Government during the last century.\n\nKHAIIR, a tahsil town in the Aligarh district, is situated on the road to the Jumna, distant 14 miles from Aligarh. The population in 1865 was 3,339, and in 1872 was 4,850. There is a tahsil, a police-station, a post-office, a school, and a munsif here. The Chaukidari Act (XX. of 1856) is in force in Khair, and in 1873 supported a village police numbering 11 men of all grades at an annual cost of Rs. 612. The number of the houses in the town in 1872-73 was 1,291, and of these 947 were assessed with a house-tax averaging Re. 0-15-6 per house and Re. 0-3-0 per head of the population per annum. The income for the same year was Rs. 968, including a balance of Rs. 52 from the previous year, and the expenditure was Rs. 844. In 1857 Khair was occupied by the Chauhans under Rao Bhupal Singh, Chauhan, who set himself up as the Raja of the parganah. On the 1st June, 1857, an expedition comprising the Agra volunteers under Mr. Watson surrounded the town and captured the rebel who was tried by court-martial and hanged. Before the end of the month the Chauhans, intent on revenge, called in the Jats and attacked Khair. The Government buildings and the houses of the wealthy Baniyas and Mahajans were plundered or destroyed. The tahsil, a strong masonry building, might have held out longer had its defenders more heart and more gunpowder. It was besieged for several days in vain, until the tahsildar and officials, despairing\nof help, withdrew in the night. It is supposed that property amounting to about three lakhs of rupees was plundered during the rule of the insurgents.\n\nKhair, a parganah of the Aligarh district, is bounded on the north by the Bulandshahr district; on the east by Koil; on the west by Chandaus and Tappal, and on the south by Parganah Nuh of Muttra and Hasangarh of this district. According to the census of 1872 this parganah had then a total area of 154 square miles and 14 acres, of which 119 square miles were under cultivation. The area assessed to Government revenue during the same year was 153 square miles, of which 118 square miles were cultivated, 12 square miles were culturable, and 23 square miles were barren. Khair extends from the north-east corner of the tahsil, where it touches parganah Khurja in a south-westerly direction until it joins Tappal near the southern extremity of its eastern boundary. It is drained by the Karon Nadi, which is dry except during the rains. The line of sand-hills in Chandaus are continued on into this parganah. Water, as a rule, is found at a depth of from 18 to 30 feet from the surface, and wicker-lined wells are common and easily made, and last for from two to three years. Of the 145 estates found at the recent settlement, 71 were zamindari, 72 were imperfect pattidari, and two were held in perfect pattidari tenure, and only 11.84 per cent. of the revenue of all these was paid by landholders possessing one village or more. The following table shows the changes that have occurred in the proprietary body between 1838 and 1868:\n\n| Caste       | Area held in 1838 | Area transferred | Area held in 1868 |\n|-------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n|             | Acres            | Acres            | Acres            |\n| Jat         | 24,678           | 15,849           | 8,829            |\n| Brahman     | 19,458           | 9,816            | 10,087           |\n| Rajput      | 23,589           | 17,357           | 6,232            |\n| Jadon       | 24,620           | 9,657            | 14,963           |\n| Nau-muslim  | 4,052            | 2,210            | 1,842            |\n| Kayath      | 998              | 998              |                  |\n| Carpenter   | 425              | 312              | 118              |\n| Total       | 96,910           | 55,649           | 41,161           |\n\nThe lands held by Jats and Jadons have, as a rule, passed into the hands of members of the same clan, whilst those possessed by Chauhans have been bought up by strangers. Parganah Khair has had seven settlements of the land-revenue including the existing one. The following statement shows the statistics of each:\n\n| Year    | No. of villages | Revenue |\n|---------|-----------------|---------|\n| 1849-51 | 115             | 10,37,101 |\n| 1852-53 | 115             | 1,12,565 |\n| 1854-55 | 115             | 1,16,532 |\n| 1856-57 | 116             | 1,28,661 |\n| 1858-59 | 124             | 4,56,290 |\nDuring the first three settlements there were two villages held free of land-revenue, and six were at that time not in the parganah. The great majority of the villages in 1821 were settled for 16 years only. The enhancement of the fifth settlement was obtained on eleven villages, ten of which were among the former 115, but were assessed only to 1829-30, and one was a revenue-free village resumed in 1825-26. The number of villages is now 125, one having been divided into two. The settlement of 1816 was made at a time when cultivation was backward, and there have been considerable and successive enhancements since then, so that the revenue has risen about 50 per cent. In Khair 5,311 acres were farmed for arrears of revenue during the currency of the past settlement, and 2,926 acres were sold, aggregating 12 per cent. of the total area, assessed with 14 per cent. of the land-revenue. Rs. 16,182 were remitted from the revenue demand during 1860-61, but as a rule the revenue has been punctually paid in this parganah. The following statement shows the areas transferred and the average year's purchase and price per acre for each decade of the last settlement:\n\n| Mode of transfer | 1839-48 | 1849-58 | 1859-68 |\n|------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n|                  | Acres   | Price per acre | Year's purchase | Acres   | Price per acre | Year's purchase | Acres   | Price per acre | Year's purchase |\n| Private sale     | 6,614   | 10 5 3   | 6 5 4   | 4,670   | 10 12 7  | 7 1   | 13,648  | 13 9 3   | 8 16   |\n| Mortgage         | 14,888  | 4 10 3   | 3 3     | 11,160  | 12 8 2   | 8 2   | 11,004  | 8 6 9    | 4 39   |\n| Auction sale     | 6,011   | 5 13 2   | 3 4 4   | 2,596   | 7 11 4   | 3 8 2L | 11,638  | 6 15 7   | 3 38   |\n| Total            | 31,213  | 6 8 2    | 4 2 9   | 18,426  | 11 6 8   | ...   | 36,285  | 9 13 8   | 5 34   |\n\nIf a single plot has changed hands twenty times, the entry has been made twenty times in this account.\n\nThe transfers by revenue process, apart from the above, amounted to 7,454 acres during the first ten years of the expired settlement, and during the whole term of settlement 5,311 acres were farmed for arrears and 6,612 acres were sold by auction on account of arrears of revenue. The price brought at these land-auctions averaged only Rs. 3-11-0 per acre, or about two years' purchase of the land-revenue. The prices brought at private sales are, however, the true standard by which to judge of the rise in the value of land. The average price per acre at private sales during the last twelve years of the expired settlement was 51-3 per cent. higher than during the first eleven years. On the whole, 47 per cent. of the area, bearing 48 per cent. of revenue, had been permanently alienated by various processes, and 11 per cent. of the area, with the same\npercentage of the land-revenue, was under temporary alienation in 1868, but of 55,649 acres transferred 37,600 acres belonged to proprietors of three-fourths of a village or more. Khartf crops occupy 46 per cent. of the cultivated area, and amongst them cotton covers 11 per cent. of the area, jodr 19 per cent., bajra 8 per cent., and moth 7 per cent. In the rabi, wheat occupies 20 per cent. of the total cultivation, bajar 17 per cent., and gram 8 per cent. Only 2,500 acres, or 3 per cent. of the cultivation, is leased on payments in kind. There were 15,998 bulls and bullocks, 9,502 buffaloes, 7,653 cows, 916 horses, and 10,167 goats and sheep in the parganah in 1868; 1,335 holdings are held by proprietors as seer, 1,082 by hereditary tenants, and 2,660 by tenants-at-will, averaging 16\u00b71 acres, 11\u00b73 acres, and 15\u00b77 acres respectively. The average rental where cash is paid is Rs. 3-14-1 per acre; hereditary tenants pay on an average Rs. 3-8-2 per acre and tenants-at-will pay Rs. 3-15-10 per acre; 80 per cent. of the cultivated area is held by cultivating proprietors. In 1838 only 375 holdings were recorded as in the possession of hereditary tenants, with an average area of 12\u00b74 acres, and an average rental of Rs. 2-12-3 per acre; whilst tenants-at-will possessed 3,247 holdings, with an average area of 15\u00b73 acres and an average rental of Rs. 3\u00b72 per acre. The areas held by each class at each period are as follows:\n\n|                | 1838 |       | 1868 |       |\n|----------------|------|-------|------|-------|\n|                | Area | Rent  | Area | Rent  |\n| Hereditary tenants | 4,677 | 12,936 | 13,331 | 49,970 |\n| Tenants-at-will   | 50,837 | 1,57,385 | 41,912 | 1,67,818 |\n\nTaluka Somna is now included in parganah Khair and is separately mentioned in the district notice. It was separately assessed at the settlement in 1838. The new assessment was made by Mr. W. H. Smith. The statistics of the present area show a total area of 98,305 acres, of which 14,845 acres are returned as barren and 365 are held free of revenue. The assessable area is distributed as follows:\n\n| Culturable     | Cultivated |\n|----------------|------------|\n| New fallow     | Irrigated  |\n| Old waste      | Dry        |\n| Groves         | Total      |\n| Acres          | Acres      |\n| 467            | 44,756     |\n| 6,544          | 31,038     |\n| 394            | 75,790     |\n|                | Grand Total|\n|                | Acres      |\n|                | 83,095     |\n\nThese figures show a proportion of culturable land to the total area amounting to 84 per cent., and of cultivation to culturable area of 91\u00b72 per cent. Irrigation\nreaches only by 59\u00b72 per cent. of the cultivated area, and the margin for increase of cultivation is only 8\u00b78 per cent. The revenue assessed amounted to Rs. 1,74,070, and the cesses to Rs. 17,407. The new land-revenue falls at Rs. 2\u00b74-9 on the cultivated acre, and gives an increase of 11 per cent. on the old assessment (Rs. 1,56,526). Irrigation has increased since last settlement by 30\u00b73 per cent. and cultivation by 4\u00b78 per cent.\n\nAccording to the census of 1872 parganah Khair contained 124 inhabited villages, of which 21 had less than 200 inhabitants; 58 had between 200 and 500; 23 had between 500 and 1,000; 19 had between 1,000 and 2,000; 2 had between 2,000 and 3,000, and one had between 3,000 and 5,000. The settlement records show that in 1874 there were 144 mahals or estates in the parganah and 125 villages with an average area of 786 acres; the largest having 3,948 acres, and the smallest having 109 acres. The total population in 1872 numbered 71,951 souls (33,320 females), giving 467 to the square mile. Classified according to religion, there were 66,890 Hind\u00fas, of whom 81,013 were females and 5,061 Musalm\u00e1ns, amongst whom 2,307 were females. Distributing the Hind\u00fa population amongst the four great classes, the census shows 16,016 Brahmans, of whom 7,409 were females; 8,419 Rajputs, including 3,798 females; 2,889 Baniyas (1,301 females): whilst the great mass of the population is included in \"the other castes\" of the census returns, which show a total of 39,566 souls, of whom 18,505 are females. The principal Brahman subdivisions found in this parganah are the Gaur (6,011), Saraswat (1,224), and San\u00e1dh (309). The Rajputs are chiefly members of the Chauh\u00e1n (1,575), Badg\u00fajar (224), Gahlot, J\u00e1don (6,146), Jangh\u00e1ra (115), and Rathor clans; and the Baniyas are of the Agarw\u00e1l (760), D\u00e1s\u00e1 (1,279), Chan-saini, Mahesri, B\u00e1rahssini, Gur\u00e1ku, and Rautgi subdivisions. Amongst the other castes, those having more than one thousand members each are the J\u00e1t (8,510), Barhai, Haj\u00e9jm, Kah\u00e1r (2,215), Koli (1,735), Cham\u00e1r (9,819), Khatik, Kh\u00e1krob, and Gararia (1,583). Those having between 100 and 1,000 members are the Son\u00e1r, M\u00e1l\u00ed, Bh\u00e1t, Kal\u00e1l, K\u00e1chhi, Darzi, Jog\u00ed, Bair\u00e1gi, Dhobi, Loh\u00e9r, Kunmh\u00e1r, Aheriya (797), Orh, Banj\u00e1ra, K\u00e1yath, Bharbh\u00fanja, Dhuniya, and Teli. Musalm\u00e1ns are distributed amongst Shaikhs (100), Path\u00e1ns (278), and those entered without distinction.\n\nThe occupations of the people are shown in the statistics collected at the census of 1872. From these it appears that of the male adult population (not less than fifteen years of age) 266 are employed in professional avocations, such as Government servants, priests, doctors, and the like; 2,602 in domestic service, as personal servants, water-carriers, barbers, sweepers, washermen, &c.; 1,316 in commerce, in buying, selling, keeping or lending money or goods, or the conveyance of men, animals, or goods; 12,355 in agricultural operations; 2,772 in industrial\noccupations, arts and mechanics, and the preparation of all classes of substances, vegetable, mineral, and animal. There were 3,914 persons returned as labourers and 656 as of no specified occupation. Taking the total population, irrespective of age or sex, the same returns give 1,490 as landholders, 33,621 as cultivators, and 36,840 as engaged in occupations unconnected with agriculture. The educational statistics, which are confessedly imperfect, show 1,466 males as able to read and write out of a total male population numbering 38,681 souls.\n\nAt the last settlement in 1888 the parganah comprised 125 villages, with an area of 98,585 acres, and a land-revenue amounting to Rs. 1,57,082. In 1841-42 two villages were transferred to parganah Koil and one to Chandans, and in 1851-52 one village was transferred to Hasangarh. Between 1841 and 1852 six villages were received from Koil and one village from Tappal, leaving Khair, including taluka Somna, possessed of 124 inhabited villages. The parganah proper was formerly occupied and owned by Chauhanas, but even at last settlement Jats and Jadons of the Somna family had each an equal share in the parganah, and there was a good sprinkling of Brahmans. Jats and Jadons have improved, whilst the Chauhanas are gradually losing the little that has remained to them.\n\nKhair, a tahsil of the Aligarh district, comprises the parganas of Chandans, Tappal, and Khair. According to the settlement statistics in 1874 it comprised a total area of 260,147 acres, of which 1,898 acres were held free of revenue and 36,304 acres were barren. The assessable area contained 222,450 acres, of which 186,988 acres were cultivated (99,914 acres irrigated) and 35,467 acres were culturable. Of the latter 597 acres were under groves. The culturable area is 85 per cent. of the total area, and cultivation covers 84 per cent. of the culturable area, whilst irrigation reaches 53 per cent. of the cultivation. The proportion of manured land is, as in Atrauli, only 9 per cent. The old revenue amounted to Rs. 3,55,177, and the new revenue to Rs. 4,01,050, falling at Rs. 2-2-4 per acre on cultivation, and giving an increase of Rs. 12-9 per cent. over the former demand. The population in 1872 numbered 169,459 souls (78,731 females), giving 417 souls to the square mile, distributed amongst 277 inhabited villages. The census statistics show 556 blind persons, 60 lepers, 24 deaf and dumb, 6 idiots, and 13 insane persons in the tahsil.\n\nThe greatest length of the tahsil, from east to west, is about 32 miles, and its greatest breadth is 22 miles, but its shape is irregular, and between these extreme distances its length and breadth varies greatly. According to the settlement records its total area is 260,159 acres, or 406-5 square miles. Khair the largest; and Chandans the smallest of the parganahs within it, occupy the eastern and greater portion of the tahsil, and Tappal forms the western tract. The Karon Nadi runs through Chandans and Khair, and is dry except during the rains. The general surface of the country is level and the character of its soil uniform; but three separate lines of bhar or sandhills running from north\nto south at varying distances from each other, undulate through Chandaus and Khair. These and the khadir of the Jumna in Tappal form the only exceptions to the uniformity of the tract. Taking the bangar portions of Tappal, the irrigating capabilities of all three parganahs are about equal and bear a fair proportion to the cultivated area.\n\nKhair is the largest tahsil in the district, though in population it is inferior to Koil. The proportion of the culturable area to the total area is 85 per cent., and of the cultivated area to the culturable area is 84 per cent., leaving only 16 per cent. for the increase of cultivation. Khair in a great measure resembles Atrauli on the east. Both tahsils have a considerable amount of khadir land; in both there is a large percentage of sandy soil, and water lies deep beneath the surface. As in Atrauli, we have first a khadir, then a large strip of high raised sandy soil parallel to the course of the river, then a level stretch of good loam, which however, in Khair, is interspersed with sandhills which mingle with those of Koil and Igl\u00e1s on the east. On the whole, however, Khair possesses more natural advantages. The ridge of sand bordering the Jamna, from the nature of the sub-soil, permits of the construction of wells, whilst on the ridge along the Ganges well-irrigation can hardly be said to exist. The canal too has been introduced here and has extended its operations very much of late years. Again, cultivating communities of Jats and Chauhans are the rule, and the division of produce system of rent is seldom met with, \"alike the cause and sign of inferiority of produce.\" The tahsil as a whole has improved very much between 1839 and 1868. During the year of re-measurement cotton and jo\u00e1r covered thirty per cent. of the total cultivated area and two-thirds of the kharif area alone, and on the other hand wheat covered exactly one-third of the rabi area, and barley and baj\u00e1r only a little more. These facts show a more than average fertility in the soil. At the last settlement the tahsil consisted of 273 villages, with an area of 249,442 acres, or 390 square miles, and a land-revenue of Rs. 3,48,161. The present area has been given above.\n\nKoil, a parganah of the Aligarh district, is bounded on the north by parganahs Barauli and Morthal; on the south by Hasangarh, Gorai, and H\u00e2thras; on the east by Atrauli and Akraabad, and on the west by Khair and Hasangarh Kh\u00fbrja. According to the census of 1872 the parganah had then a total area of 274 square miles and 100 acres, of which 186 square miles were under cultivation. The area assessed to Government revenue during the same year was 268 square miles, of which 182 square miles were cultivated, 18 square miles were culturable, and 68 square miles were barren. The Koil tahsil lies almost in the centre of the district on the watershed between the great rivers. The level is therefore high and the soil of uniform character. Vast tracts of \u00fasar, commencing in a north-west direction, run in a more or less connected line almost parallel with the course of the canal.\nBhur villages are found here and there, but they are few and far between, and mostly lie in the tract between the Khair and Igl\u00e1s metalled roads. The soil for the most part is good loam, and the tract to the north-east, so backward at the past settlement, is now so improved by irrigation that little or no inferiority is apparent in it when compared with the remainder of the tahsil.\n\nThe settlement of parganah Koil in 1838 was made by Mr. Thornton, and after his revision there were 288 villages, with an area of 145,232 acres and a revenue of Rs. 2,25,814. The former assessment was very unequal. There appears to have been, during the last century, a very general dispossession of the original proprietors, and a great number of estates, especially those lying close to the city, fell into the hands of the Lodhas and other castes as managers. Many of the villages thus held were very heavily assessed at the previous settlements, whilst the kanungo families and others who possessed greater influence obtained easier terms. The consequence was that there was much poverty and distress in parts of it. Mr. Thornton reduced the former assessment by Rs. 3,718, and his rates fell at Rs. 2-4 per cultivated acre. Since then numerous changes have taken place in the boundaries of the parganah, and these are noted hereafter. Out of a total area of 175,274 acres at the present settlement, 41,377 acres were found to be barren and 5,567 acres were held free of revenue. In 1838, out of a total area of 162,603 acres, 35,301 acres were entered as barren and 4,120 as free of revenue. The distribution of the assessable area at both assessments was as follows:\n\n| Year | Culturable | Cultivated |\n|------|------------|------------|\n|      | New fallow | Old waste | Gross | Total | Irrigated | Dry. | Total | Grand Total |\n|      | Acres      | Acres     | Acres | Acres | Acres     | Acres | Acres | Acres       |\n| 1866 | 1,041      | 10,283    | 954   | 12,278| 91,949    | 24,103| 116,052| 128,380     |\n| 1838 | Inaccurate | ...       | 13,160| 77,880| 38,142   | 111,022| 132,182|\n\nThe culturable area is 73 per cent. of the total area and the percentage of cultivation to the culturable area is 90. The percentage of irrigated area to cultivation is 79, against 72 at the preceding settlement. Only nine per cent. of the culturable area is actually available for the extension of cultivation. The same excessive assessment seems in a great measure to have been continued by Mr. Thornton, who took 70 per cent. of the assets, so that the increase in the new assessment has not been more than 15 per cent., giving a land-revenue of Rs. 281,600 and cesses Rs. 28,160.\nThe following statement shows the character of the transfers made during each decade of the expired settlement:\n\n| Mode of transfer | 1839-1848 | 1849-1858 | 1859-1867 |\n|------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n|                  | Acres     | Rs. a. p. | Acres     | Rs. a. p. | Acres     | Rs. a. p. |\n| Private sale     | 9,527     | 6 8 2     | 13,824    | 10 2 0   | 23,318    | 13 12 0   |\n| Mortgage        | 15,085    | 5 5 11    | 12,155    | 7 6 2    | 11,548    | 14 4 2    |\n| Auction sale     | 9,672     | 6 11 3    | 7,859     | 7 11 4   | 14,055    | 8 9 3     |\n| Total            | 34,182    | 6 0 10    | 35,859    | 8 8 11   | 48,921    | 12 6 7    |\n\nThe settlement of the city of Koil is noticed under the description of the city; and the history of the talukas of Aisa, Manchaura, Sakrawali, Sahibabad, and the grants held by the Derridon family, is given under the district notice. The alienations during the term of the past settlement in this parganah have been very numerous. In 234 out of 330 villages, an area of 118,650 acres, out of a total area of 164,776 acres, has been transferred: 42 per cent. of these have passed by private sale, 34 per cent. by mortgage, and 24 per cent. by order of the civil courts. It is unquestionable that the proximity of a large city brings about a rapid movement of property. The facilities for contracting loans are great and the money-lenders are ever accommodating, and in addition to these the temptations to extravagance and luxury are also very great. Hence temporary mortgages often end in private sales, \"or the land is put up for sale in satisfaction of the decrees of a civil court, which is at the door of the usurious lender, and the accessibility of which encourages both fraudulent and frivolous claims.\" The principal losers are Thakurs, Sayyids, and Musalmans Rajputs, and no matter how long the day may be delayed, the remainder of them must all go, sooner or later, to make room for the usurers, who are the only monied men left. Fifty-two per cent. of the estates in this parganah are held on a zamindari tenure. In 1857 hereditary tenants paid on an average Rs. 3-7-4 per acre for their cultivation: this rate increased in 1868 to Rs. 3-9-7; tenants-at-will, in 1857, paid Rs. 3-4-3, which increased by 17\u00bd per cent., or to Rs. 3-13-5, in 1868. In Koil only 267 biswas, with an area of 7,817 acres, were farmed, and 50 biswa shares, with an area of 682 acres, were sold for arrears of land-revenue between 1838 and 1868. A few confiscations for rebellion took place after 1857.\n\nAccording to the census of 1872 parganah Koil contained 269 inhabited villages, of which 63 had less than 200 inhabitants; 109 had between 200 and 500, 75 had between 500 and 1,000;\nhad between 1,000 and 2,000, and three had between 2,000 and 3,000. The towns containing more than 5,000 inhabitants were Aligarh or Koil, with 58,539; Hardusganj, with 6,970; and Jalali, with 7,480. The settlement records show altogether 274 villages, distributed amongst 321 mahals or estates. The average village area comprises 639 acres, the smallest containing only 96 acres. The total population in 1872 numbered 194,160 souls (89,945 females), giving 708 to the square mile. Classified according to religion, there were 161,061 Hindus, of whom 74,009 were females; 33,061 Musalmans, amongst whom 15,994 were females; and 38 Christians. Distributing the Hindu population amongst the four great classes, the census shows 21,106 Brahmans, of whom 9,578 were females; 22,675 Rajputs, including 10,028 females; 12,016 Baniyas (5,549 females); whilst the great mass of the population is included in \"the other castes\" of the census returns, which show a total of 105,264 souls, of whom 48,863 are females. The principal Brahman subdivisions found in this parganah are the Gaur (1,690), Saraswat (2,078), Sanadh (1,388), Kanaujiya, and Gujrati. The Rajputs chiefly belong to the Gahlot (115), Chauhan (2,297), Badgujar (588), Jadon (15,380), Janghara (2,332), Tomar, Pundir, Solankhi, Rathor, Panwar, Jaishwar, Bhial and Bachhal clans. The Baniyas are of the Agarwal (2,867), Chausaini (686), Dasa (841), Maheeri (1,119), Barahsaini (5,125), Khandelwal, Gurkha, Sarangi, and Lohiya subdivisions. Amongst the other castes the following have more than 1,000 members each:\u2014Jat (8,676), Sonar (1,407), Barhai (4,368), Hajjam (3,521), Mali (2,396), Kheshhi (1,444), Ahir (1,997), Darzi, Kahar (3,506), Dhobi, Koil (6,613), Cham\u00e1r (31,697), Khatik, Khakrob (4,585), Kumbar (2,090), Garwariya (6,021), Kayath (3,386), Lodha (9,615), and Dhuna. The following have less than 1,000 and more than one 100 members each:\u2014Raj, Bh\u00e1t, Kal\u00e1l, Gosh\u00e1in, Joshi, Jog\u00ed, Bairagi, Loh\u00e1r, Ah\u00e9riya (790), Orb, Bharbhunja, Teli, Kanjar, Chhipi, and Riwari. Musalmans are distributed amongst Shaikhs (4,496), Sayyids (1,967), Mughals (403), and Pathans (4,373). The remainder are entered without distinction.\n\nThe occupations of the people are shown in the statistics collected at the census of 1872. From these it appears that of the male adult population (not less than fifteen years of age) 1,045 are employed in professional avocations, such as Government servants, priests, doctors, and the like; 12,585 in domestic service, as personal servants, water-carriers, barbers, sweepers, washermen, &c.; 4,534 in commerce, in buying, selling, keeping or lending money or goods, or the conveyance of men, animals, or goods; 21,321 in agricultural operations; 11,424 in industrial occupations, arts and mechanics, and the preparation of all classes of substances, vegetable, mineral, and animal. There were 18,719 persons returned as labourers and 1,397 as of no specified occupation. Taking the total population, irrespective\nof age or sex, the same returns give 7,374 as landholders, 55,880 as cultivators, and 130,906 as engaged in occupations unconnected with agriculture. The educational statistics, which are confessedly imperfect, show 5,725 males as able to read and write out of a total male population numbering 104,215 souls.\n\nNumerous changes have taken place in the limits of the parganah since the settlement in 1838. The changes up to 1870 are shown in the following table:\n\n| Year | Transferred to | No. of villages | Area | Land-revenue |\n|------|----------------|-----------------|------|--------------|\n|      |                |                 | Acres | Rs.          |\n| 1851-2 | Khair         | 6               | 3,856 | 5,404        |\n|       | Chandauli     |                 | 908   | 1,511        |\n|       | Morthal       |                 | 540   | 856          |\n|       | Hasangarh     |                 | 5     | 1,456        |\n|       | Goral         |                 | 65    | 22,979       |\n| Total |                | 78              | 29,669| 53,902       |\n\n| Year | Received from | No. of villages | Area | Land-revenue |\n|------|---------------|-----------------|------|--------------|\n|      |               |                 | Acres | Rs.          |\n| 1851-2 | Khair         | 2               | 1,759 | 2,250        |\n|       | Akabad        |                 | 22    | 20,875       |\n|       | Jalalai       |                 | 22    | 27,079       |\n| Total |               | 57              | 49,943| 70,927       |\n\nKOIL, a tahsil of the Aligarh district, comprises the parganahs of Koil, Morthal, and Barauli. The total area according to the settlement records of 1874 amounts to 227,897 acres, of which 5,575 acres are held free of revenue and 53,088 acres are barren. The assessable area amounts to 169,234 acres, of which 17,878 acres are culturable and 151,856 acres are cultivated. Of the culturable area, 1,533 acres are new fallow, 14,634 acres are old waste, and 1,111 acres are under groves. Of the cultivated area, 119,070 acres are irrigated. The new assessments amounted to Rs. 3,60,569, and the cesses to Rs. 36,055, or a total of Rs. 3,96,624. The new land-revenue gave an increase of 19 per cent. over the current revenue, and falls at Rs. 2-5-11 per cultivated acre. In 1872 the population numbered 280,669 souls (106,842 females), giving 848 souls to the square mile, distributed amongst 350 inhabited villages. The same statistics show 571 persons blind, 45 lepers, 23 deaf and dumb, 19 idiots, and 20 insane persons in the tahsil.\n\nThis tahsil is an old one. It was known as the Hazur tahsil up to 1840, when the name was changed to the Koil tahsil. It is divided into two unequal parts by the Grand Trunk Road running from the south-east corner in a north-western direction, and into two still more unequal portions by the Ganges Canal. Property is considerably subdivided throughout the tahsil: 55 per cent. of the\n\n---\n\n1 See Rev. Rep., V., 69.\nestates are held in zamindari tenure, 15-5 per cent. in perfect pattidari, and the remainder are bhayash\u00e1ra. Only 18 per cent. of the land-revenue is paid by proprietors who own more than one village, 25-5 per cent. by villages owned by less than six sharers, and 56-5 per cent. by proprietary communities. Twenty-three per cent., or nearly a quarter of the cultivated area, is recorded as the seer of proprietors. Hereditary tenants cultivate 28 per cent. of the cultivated area, or 36 per cent. of the tenants' land, and hold 42,411 acres: tenants-at-will occupy 74,240 acres, or 49 per cent. of the cultivated area, and 64 per cent. of the tenants' land. The holdings of hereditary tenants average 8-7 acres each, and of tenants-at-will 11 acres; and all tenants together, 10 acres, or 17-5 pukka bighas, which are equivalent to 53 kuchha bighas. The average rental per acre paid by hereditary tenants is Rs. 3-8-11, and by tenants-at-will Rs. 3-13-8, giving a general rate of Rs. 3-12-0 per acre. The papers of the revision of 1857 show a rate for hereditary tenants of Rs. 3-6-3 per acre, and a rate for tenants-at-will of Rs. 3-1-10, giving a general rate of Rs. 3-2-8 per acre, which shows a rise, during the last decade, of 4-9 per cent. in the rents paid by hereditary tenants, of 22-37 per cent. in the rents paid by tenants-at-will, and a general rise of 18-4 per cent. The greatest rise has been in Morthal, which, owing to the influence of the canal, has increased its competition rate 43-8 per cent. In Barauli the increase has been 37-2 per cent., and in Koil only 17-5 per cent.\n\nIn 1857 the holdings of hereditary tenants had an average area of 12 acres, and by 1868 this had dwindled down to 8 acres: the holdings of tenants-at-will have remained the same, or 11 acres. But though the area held by each hereditary tenant has diminished, the total area held by that class of tenant has increased. In 1857 they held only 20,877 acres, and in 1868 their total holdings covered 42,411 acres; or more than double the amount of land formerly cultivated by them, and at a rate 8 per cent. below that paid by other cultivators. Here there were no powerful talukadars, as in Atrauli, to contest and practically prohibit the growth of occupancy rights, and the result is that the old cultivators have more than held their own. The old tenants probably held better land, and so paid a higher rate in 1857, but with the introduction of the canal into the poorer lands held by the tenants-at-will, the landholders have been able to increase the rates paid by the latter class of tenants, and to extract from them a much larger proportional share of the benefits derived from irrigation than they can from their old tenants. Seventy-eight per cent. of the cultivated area at assessment was irrigated, and of this, 80,424 acres, or 66 per cent. of the total irrigation, was from wells. 10-5 per cent. of the area is unirrigated sand, and rabi crops occupy 52 per cent. of the total cultivation; khari crops 47 per cent.; and miscellaneous crops, such as tobacco and the like, one per cent. In the rabi, wheat takes up 25 per cent. of the total area, barley 11 per cent., bajri 8 per cent., and gram 7 per cent. In the khari, cotton covers 14 per cent. of the\narea, jodr occupies 18 per cent., bajra 6 per cent., and indigo 4 per cent. Two per cent. of the area leased to tenants in Koil and 7 per cent. in the remainder of the tahsil was paid for in kind, but only in the worst villages, where poor sandy soil prevails. The entire increase in cultivation between 1838 and 1868 amounts to only 5\u00bd per cent., but a very appreciable portion of the cultivated and culturable area has been taken up for the purposes of the canal, railway and roads. Twenty-six per cent. of the total area is unassessable, 9 per cent. comprises culturable waste, and one per cent. is under groves. The proportion of cultivation to the culturable area is 90 per cent., and of culturable land to the total area is 74 per cent.\n\nMahu, a town in parganah H\u00e2thras of the Aligarh district, is distant 12 miles from H\u00e2thras and 20 miles from Aligarh. In 1865 there were 1,473 inhabitants, and in 1872 there were 1,515.\n\nMandrak, a village in parganah Koil of the Aligarh district, is distant 7 miles from Koil on the Agra road. The population in 1865 numbered 1,496, and in 1872 there were 1,937 inhabitants. The Mandrak indigo factory was the scene of the spirited defence made by Mr. Watson and eleven Europeans against 1,000 Musalm\u00e2n rebels on the 1st of July, 1857, and which has been noticed in the district history. The Chawkidari Act (XX. of 1856) is in force in Mandrak, and in 1873 supported a village police numbering four men of all grades, at an annual cost of Rs. 216. The number of the houses in the town in 1872-73 was 340, and of these 240 were assessed with a house-tax averaging Re. 1-1-16 per house and Re. 0-2-7 per head of the population per annum. The income for the same year was Rs. 380, including a balance of Rs. 62 from the previous year, and the expenditure was Rs. 296.\n\nMendu, a town in parganah H\u00e2thras of the Aligarh district, is distant 4 miles from H\u00e2thras and 17 miles from Aligarh. The population in 1865 was 4,194, and in 1872 there were 4,262 inhabitants. Mendu gave its name to a taluka, an account of which is given in the district notice. The Chawkidari Act (XX. of 1856) is in force in Mendu, and in 1873 supported a village police numbering nine men of all grades at an annual cost of Rs. 528. The number of the houses in the town in 1872-73 was 929, and of these 875 were assessed with a house-tax averaging Re. 0-15-7 per house and Re. 0-2-11 per head of the population per annum. The income for the same year was Rs. 1,010, including a balance of Rs. 158 from the previous year, and the expenditure was Rs. 870.\n\nMitai, a town in parganah H\u00e2thras of the Aligarh district, is distant 5 miles from H\u00e2thras and 26 miles from Aligarh. In 1865 there were 1,583 inhabitants, and in 1872 there were 1,619.\n\nMorthal, a small parganah in tahsil Koil of the Aligarh district, is bounded on the north by parganah Pah\u00e2su of the Bulandshahr district; on the\nsouth by Koil; on the east by Atrauli; and on the west by Koil. By the census return of 1872 the parganah had then a total area of 82 square miles and 8 acres, of which 55 square miles and 8 acres were under cultivation. The area assessed to Government revenue during the same year was 82 square miles, of which 55 square miles were cultivated, 8 square miles were culturable, and 19 square miles were barren.\n\nThe physical features of the parganah so resemble that of Koil that it is needless to repeat them here. It originally formed part of the Atrauli tahsil, but since 1852 has been included in Koil. The zamindars are chiefly Chauhan Rajputs. Mr. Thornton, writing in 1838, says:\u2014\u201cThere have been more sales by auction, and there is generally more pecuniary distress in this taluka than in any other tract of land which I know of equal size, when the revenue has been on the whole so moderate. The zamindars have possessed great facilities for borrowing money, in consequence of there being a large mart in the neighbourhood, named Harduaganj. The Baniyas who reside in that town generally exact badni engagements in return, and this is a system which, sooner or later, is sure to ruin the borrowing party. Besides the above disadvantages, the soil of this taluka is for the most part of a decidedly inferior kind. The system of cultivation is almost entirely badni, or by division of crops. The proportion of irrigation is 57 per cent., of which 54 per cent. is furnished by the Kali Nadi and by tanks or jhuls, and is of less value than that which is afforded by wells. Under these circumstances, the new revenue, although higher by Rs. 104 than the old, falls only at Re. 1-13-6\u00bd per cultivated acre.\u201d\n\nThe new assessment was made by Mr. W. H. Smith: the statistics of area are as follow:\n\n| Unassessable | Culturable | Cultivated |\n|--------------|------------|------------|\n|              |            |            |\n|              |            |            |\n|              |            |            |\n\nHere the proportion of the cultivated to the culturable area is 87 per cent., whilst the proportion of culturable soil to the total area is 82 per cent. Irrigation covers 82 per cent. of the cultivated area, showing an increase of 62 per cent. The new assessment was made at Rs. 58,379, and the cesses stand at Rs. 5,836. The increase in the land-revenue over the old settlement amounts to 36 per cent. The changes that have occurred in Morhal from 1839 to 1868 affect 46 out of 64 villages; and 24,072 acres out of a total of 35,091 acres\nwere transferred, forming 72 per cent. of the entire area. Nearly all this, as noted above, formerly belonged to the Chauhans. The following table shows these changes more clearly:\n\n| Mode of transfer | 1839-1846 | 1849-1858 | 1859-1867 |\n|------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n|                  | Acres     | Rs. a. p. | Acres     | Rs. a. p. | Acres     | Rs. a. p. |\n| Private sale     | 2,677     | 10 12 8   | 14 1     | 2,907     | 10 8 11   | 7 7       |\n| Mortgage         | 501       | 3 13 0    | 3 3      | 3,390     | 8 13 11   | 6 0       |\n| Auction sale     | 2,025     | 8 9 5     | 9 3      | 2,287     | 8 15 7    | 4 7       |\n| Total            | 5,213     | 9 4 2     | 10 7     | 8,534     | 8 8 10    | 6 2       |\n\nOn the whole the Chauhans have retained but few of their old possessions, and these few are slowly but surely passing out of their hands. High prices and enhanced rents have not changed the characteristics of the clan in this district, and debt, idleness and extravagance, are still producing their natural results. One thing may be noticed here, and that is the gradual rise in the value of land. The average price per acre, though weighted by the sales of land under decrees of the civil courts, which are so low owing to incumbrances, still show a decided rise in each decade of the past settlement, and the tendency is still towards a rise. At no time was there any difficulty found in paying the late assessment, which was framed at 70 per cent. of the assets then existing, and the present light assessment should, therefore, be easily paid. Only 25 shares, amounting to 219 acres, were farmed for arrears of revenue between 1838 and 1868; 51 per cent. of the estates in this parganah are held on a zamindari tenure. In 1857 hereditary tenants paid on an average Rs. 3-7-0 per acre on their cultivation; this had increased in 1868 to Rs. 3-9-2; tenants-at-will in 1857 paid Rs. 2-10-10 per acre, and this increased in 1868 by 42-8 per cent., or to Rs. 3-13-2 per acre.\n\nAccording to the census of 1872 parganah Morthal contained 57 inhabited villages, of which 16 had less than 200 inhabitants; 25 had between 200 and 500; 11 had between 500 and 1,000; four had between 1,000 and 2,000; and one had between 2,000 and 3,000. The settlement records show altogether 54 villages, distributed amongst 66 mahals or estates.\nThe total population in 1872 numbered 26,857 souls (12,342 females), giving 445 to the square mile. Classified according to religion, there were 25,153 Hind\u00fas, of whom 11,582 were females; and 1,704 Musalm\u00e1ns, amongst whom 760 were females. Distributing the Hind\u00fa population amongst the four great classes, the census shows 3,406 Brahmins, of whom 1,583 were females; 2,945 Rajputs, including 1,284 females; 960 Baniyas (450 females); whilst the great mass of the population is included in \"the other castes\" of the census returns, which show a total of 18,842 souls, of whom 9,265 are females. The principal Brahmin subdivisions found in this parganah are the Gati (372) and Saraswat. The Rajputs chiefly belong to the Chauhan (1,964), Gahlot, Badg\u00fajar, J\u00e1toun (586), Janghar\u00e1 and Bais clans, and the Baniyas to the Agarw\u00e1l, Dasa, Mahesri, and B\u00e1rahssaini subdivisions. Amongst the other castes, those which have more than 1,000 members each are the J\u00e1t (1,001), Cham\u00e1r (51,756), Garariya (1,327), and Lodha (2,860) castes.\n\nThe following castes have less than 1,000 and more than 100 members:\u2014 Barhai, Hajj\u00e1m, Kal\u00e1l, Ahfr, Kachhi, Darzi, Kab\u00e1r, Dhobi, Loh\u00e1r, Koli; Khatik, Kh\u00e1krob, Kumh\u00e1r, and K\u00e1yath. The Musalm\u00e1ns comprise Shaikhs (133), Path\u00e1ns (144), and a number unspecified.\n\nThe occupations of the people are shown in the statistics collected at the census of 1872. From these it appears that of the male adult population (not less than fifteen years of age) 40 are employed in professional avocations, such as Government servants, priests, doctors, and the like; 968 in domestic service, as personal servants, water-carriers, barbers, sweepers, washermen, &c.; 276 in commerce, in buying, selling, keeping or lending money or goods, or the conveyance of men, animals, or goods; 4,728 in agricultural operations; 637 in industrial occupations, arts and mechanics, and the preparation of all classes of substances, vegetable, mineral, and animal. There were 2,050 persons returned as labourers and 89 as of no specified occupation. Taking the total population, irrespective of age or sex, the same returns give 715 as landholders, 12,527 as cultivators, and 13,615 as engaged in occupations unconnected with agriculture. The educational statistics, which are confessedly imperfect, show 191 males as able to read and write out of a total male population numbering 14,515 souls.\n\nMorthal and Barauli are mere talukas, and are practically looked upon as one parganah in the revenue records. Both of them originally formed part of Parganah Koil, and during the last century became detached as separate talukas. Morthal belonged almost entirely to a Chauhan colony, and now, though a few villages, belong to B\u00e1kir Ali Kh\u00e1n of Findr\u00e1wal, and a few to Mah\u00e1jans, the parganah may be said to be divided between the old Chauhan\nproprietors and the Musalm\u00e1n Badg\u00fajar Mahmud Ali Kh\u00e1n of Chat\u00e1ri. The following changes took place since 1838:\n\n| Year | Transferred to | Villages | Area | Revenue |\n|------|----------------|----------|------|---------|\n|      |                |          | Acres | Rs.     |\n| 1851-52 | Atrauli | 9 | 1,512 | 1,456 |\n|        | Bulandahahr | 18 | 11,187 | 10,378 |\n| Total |                | 20 | 12,649 | 11,834 |\n\n| Year | Received from | Villages | Area | Revenue |\n|------|---------------|----------|------|---------|\n|      |               |          | Acres | Rs.     |\n| 1851-52 | Koll | 1 | 522 | 526 |\n|        | Atrauli | 1 | 298 | 198 |\n| Total |               | 2 | 821 | 1,316 |\n\nMurs\u00e1n, a town in parganah Murs\u00e1n and tahsil H\u00e1thras of the Aligarh district, lies 24 miles from Aligarh and 7 miles from H\u00e1thras, on the Muttra road. The population in 1853 was 6,568, and in 1865 was 5,572. In 1872 there were 5,998 inhabitants, of whom 5,009 were Hind\u00fas (2,223 females) and 989 were Musalm\u00e1ns (442 females). The town site occupies an area of 69 square acres, giving 87 souls to the acre. The town is separated from the Muttra road by an excavation, to the east and west of which run the roads from Aligarh by Igl\u00e1s, and that from the fort to the main road. The latter forms the principal street and bazarway, and shortly after it enters the town it branches into two near the ganj and joins the Igl\u00e1s road. It is raised and drained at the sides, but all the other ways are low, unmetalled, and ill-kept. There are but 30 or 40 brick-built houses, and these belong to grain-merchants. Murs\u00e1n is essentially an agricultural town, and there is hardly any trade, except in country produce which eventually finds its way to H\u00e1thras. The well-water is good and lies at about 30 feet from the surface. There are two schools here, a police-station, and a post-office. On the whole the place appears to be neglected, and neither the Raja nor any one else takes much interest in its improvement. The Raja employs two native physicians to attend the people in the town, but beyond this nothing has been done for it. There is a sar\u00e1\u00ed for travellers and an encamping-ground for carts near the high road. The Chaukid\u00e1ri Act (XX. of 1856) is in force in Murs\u00e1n, and in 1873 supported a village police numbering 13 men of all grades, at an annual cost of Rs. 744. The number of the houses in the town in 1872-73 was 1,282, and of these 1,081 were assessed with a house-tax averaging Re. 1-1-10 per house and Re. 0-3-2 per head of the population per annum. The income for the same year was Rs. 1,275, including a balance of Rs. 69 from the previous year; and the expenditure was Rs. 1,171.\n\nThe history of Murs\u00e1n is that of the J\u00e1t Rajas of the place, and this has already been given in the district notice. Raja Tikam Singh, C.S.I., the present representative, is an Honorary Magistrate. On the capture of Daya R\u00e1m's fort of H\u00e1thras in 1817, the Murs\u00e1n Raja, Bhagwant Singh, surrendered his fort, of which the bastions and\nwalls were dismantled by the British forces. The fort is now in ruins, and is occupied by the followers of the Raja and the house of the Raja; but the latter chiefly resides in another house at some distance from the fort.\n\nMURS\u00c1N, a parganah in tahsil H\u00e1thras of the Aligarh district, is bounded on the north by Rasangarh; on the west and south by the Muttra district; and on the east by H\u00e1thras. The census statistics of 1872 show a total area of 73 square miles and 79 acres, of which 66 square miles were under cultivation. The area assessed to Government revenue during the same year was 67 square miles, of which 61 square miles were cultivated, one square mile was culturable, and five square miles were barren.\n\nThis parganah is a continuation of tahsil Igl\u00e1s, and is marked by similar physical characteristics. The K\u00e1ron N\u00e1di runs down its centre, with a kh\u00e1dir of good quality and tolerably fertile. As in Igl\u00e1s, however, parallel lines of sandy soil run within a short distance of each side, limited in extent on the west, and broader and more irregular on the east. These are well-defined tracts and of far greater extent and poorer capability than those in H\u00e1thras. There are no jh\u00edla in the parganah larger than ponds, and no stream other than the K\u00e1ron. This absence of rivers and tanks is however made up for by the great facilities afforded for well-irrigation. Water is found at a depth of 25 to 30 feet from the surface, fed by inexhaustible springs and the subsoil is good.\n\nThe fiscal history of the parganah is given under the Mur\u00e1s\u00e1n family in the notice of the Aligarh district. The villages of this parganah were divided by Mr. Thornton in 1834 into samudd\u00e1ri, mukad\u00e1mi, and talukad\u00e1ri. The first comprised those villages in which the Raja of Mur\u00e1s\u00e1n was found to have proprietary rights; the second, those settled with the village communities; and the third, those settled with the Raja on the refusal of the village communities to accept the engagements for the land-revenue. Up to Mr. Thornton's revision the total amount of revenue due from the parganah had been paid through the Raja, and the sum realisable by him in the previous settlement was Rs. 2,05,414, of which the Government land-revenue was Rs. 1,74,602. Mr. Thornton reduced the demand by 13 per cent., or to Rs. 1,52,053, of which the Raja paid Rs. 60,102 for the villages settled with him, and Rs. 91,951 for the mukad\u00e1mi villages, which paid to the Raja Rs. 118,624. The incidence of the revenue was Rs. 2-9-6 per cultivated acre. This settlement framed on the heavy assessments that had been exacted by the former talukad\u00e1rs, worked very badly; and though remissions and revisions were made, 7,269 acres, or 17\u00b767 per cent. of the entire area, were farmed, and 2,037 acres, or 4\u00b795 per cent. of the area, were sold for arrears of revenue during the currency of Mr. Thornton's settlement. In addition to this, 38,867 acres, or 94\u00b752 per cent., changed hands by private sale, mortgage or forced sale. At the conclusion of the present settlement operations...\nin 1872, only 16,052 acres, or 39 per cent. of the total area, remained to the old proprietors, whilst 19,943 acres, or 48\u00bd per cent., had been permanently transferred to others, and the remainder had been mortgaged. J\u0101ts, Brahmins, Gahlots, and Musalmans have been the principal losers and money-lenders the gainers.\n\nThe following statement shows the loss to each caste:\n\n| Caste | Area held in 1838 | Lost between 1838 and 1868 by Sale | Mortgage | Total | Remaining |\n|-------|------------------|-----------------------------------|----------|-------|-----------|\n|       |                  |                                   |          |       |           |\n| Aib\u0101si | 549              | 91                                 | 165      | 256   | 293       |\n| Sar\u0101d\u0101 | 8,710            | 4,159                              | 1,107    | 5,266 | 3,464     |\n| \u0100garw\u0101la | 42             | ...                                | ...      | ...   | 42        |\n| Gahlot | 4,087            | 2,890                              | 414      | 3,094 | 943       |\n\nBetween 1838 and 1869 the parganah has been reduced by the transfer of 66 villages to other parganahs. Originally the parganah was formed on purely historical considerations, and the recent changes have been made to form a compact area for administrative purposes; any minute comparison therefore with previous areas is out of the question.\n\nThe new assessment of the land-revenue has been made by Mr. W. H. Smith. The statistics of area show a total area of 46,607 acres, of which 2,514 acres are returned as barren, and 3,536 acres are held free of revenue. The distribution of the assessable area is as follows:\n\n| Cultivable | Cultivated |\n|------------|------------|\n| New fallow | Old waste  |\n| Acres.     | Acres.     |\n| 150        | 1,463      |\n| Groves     | Acres.     |\n| 39         |            |\n| Total      | Acres.     |\n| 1,692      |            |\n| Irrigated  | Dry.       |\n| Acres.     | Acres.     |\n| 35,751     | 3,154      |\n| Total      | Acres.     |\n| 38,905     |            |\n| Grand Total| Acres.     |\n| 40,557     |            |\n\nThe proportion of culturable land to the total area is 87 per cent.; and here also cultivation is very high, being 96 per cent. of the culturable area. Irrigation, too, reaches 92 per cent. of the entire cultivated area, and only four per cent. of the culturable area, including land under groves, has not yet been brought under the plough. Cultivation has increased by 9\u00b718 per cent., and irrigation by 9\u00b78 per cent. since last settlement. The new assessment amounts to Rs. 1,06,890-8-0, and the cesses to Rs. 10,869. Murs\u0101n is undoubtedly\ninferior to H\u00e1thras in its soil: it contains 6 per cent. of dry bhair, and a large proportion of the irrigated area is of the same character. The old land-revenue at the commencement of the past settlement stood at Rs. 95,209, which rose to Rs. 95,848 when the new settlement commenced. The increase shown at the new assessment amounts to 11 per cent. Out of 143 mah\u00e1ls or estates in 1872, nine were held free of revenue, 76 were zamind\u00e1ri, and 58 were bh\u00e1yach\u00e1ra.\u00b9 59-8 per cent. of the total area is held by numerous sharers, 7 per cent. by a few, and the remainder almost entirely by the Raja of Murs\u00e1n. The khar\u00edf occupies 55 per cent. of the cultivated area, and in it cotton covers 13\u00b75 per cent. of the total cultivated area, jodr 21\u00b75 per cent., and bajra 7\u00b75 per cent. Amongst the rabi crops, wheat occupies 14 per cent. of the entire cultivation, barley 15 per cent., and bajra 9 per cent. 708 holdings are in the possession of cultivating proprietors as seer, 1,071 holdings are held by hereditary cultivators, and 2,130 holdings by tenants-at-will, or 18\u00b76 per cent., 30\u00b75 per cent., and 50\u00b79 per cent. respectively of the total cultivated area. The area of each proprietary holding averages 10\u00b76 acres. Thus, tenants who were formerly for the most part proprietors occupy 81\u00b74 per cent. of the cultivated area, and the landowners are nearly all absentees. The average rental is Rs. 4\u00b715\u00b70 per acre; hereditary tenants pay, on an average, Rs. 4\u00b713\u00b74 per acre, whilst tenants-at-will pay Rs. 5\u00b70\u00b72 per acre. Though inferior to H\u00e1thras, the general rent-rate in this parganah is slightly in excess. In Murs\u00e1n 7,515 cultivated acres are recorded as seer, 12,302 acres as held by hereditary tenants, and 20,526 acres as held by tenants-at-will.\n\nAccording to the census of 1872, parganah Murs\u00e1n contained 129 inhabited villages, of which 51 had less than 200 inhabitants, 58 had between 200 and 500, 19 had between 500 and 1,000, and 5 had between 1,000 and 2,000. The only town containing more than 5,000 inhabitants is Murs\u00e1n itself. The settlement records show that there were 142 villages in the parganah in 1872, distributed amongst 143 mah\u00e1ls or estates. The average area of each village was 328 acres. The total population in 1872 numbered 47,496 souls (21,876 females), giving 651 to the square mile. Classified according to religion, there were 44,049 Hind\u00fas, of whom 20,269 were females; 3,447 Musalm\u00e1ns, amongst whom 1,607 were females. Distributing the Hind\u00fa population amongst the four great classes, the census shows 9,908 Brahmans, of whom 4,572 were females; 973 Rajputs, including 444 females; 1,775 Baniyas (824 females); whilst the great mass of the population is included in \"the other castes\" of the census returns, which show a total of 31,393 souls, of whom 14,429 are females. The principal Brahman subdivisions found in this parganah are the Gaur (558), San\u00e1dh (1,136), and\n\n\u00b9 For further details as to the fiscal history of this parganah, see Sett. Rep. I, 247, and Rev., Rep. II, N. S., 49.\nSaraswat (54). Rajputs belong to the Gahlot (566), Chauhan, and Badgujar clans, and the Baniyas to the Agarwal (1,104), Mahesri (241), Barahsaini (112), Dasa, and Chausaini subdivisions. The following, amongst the other castes, have more than 1,000 members each:\u2014Jat (8,849), Barhai, Hajjam, Koli (2,031), and Cham\u00e1r (18,625). The following have less than 1,000, but more than 100 members each:\u2014Son\u00e1r, Bh\u00e1t, Kal\u00e1\u00ed, Ahir, Kachhi, Darzi, Jogi, Kah\u00e1r, Bairagi, Dhobi, Khatik, Khakrob, Kumbh\u00e1r, Garariya, Aheriya, Kayath, and Mallah. The Musalmans are distributed amongst Shaikhs (803), Sayyids (101), and Pathans (460); the remainder of the Muhammadan population is entered without distinction.\n\nThe occupations of the people are shown in the statistics collected at the census of 1872. From these it appears that of the male adult population (not less than fifteen years of age) 205 are employed in professional avocations, such as Government servants, priests, doctors, and the like; 2,090 in domestic service, as personal servants, water-carriers, barbers, sweepers, washermen, &c.; 1,031 in commerce, in buying, selling, keeping or lending money or goods, or the conveyance of men, animals, or goods; 6,560 in agricultural operations; 2,324 in industrial occupations, arts and mechanics, and the preparation of all classes of substances, vegetable, mineral, and animal. There were 3,585 persons returned as labourers and 419 as of no specified occupation. Taking the total population, irrespective of age or sex, the same returns give 954 as landholders, 17,425 as cultivators, and 29,117 as engaged in occupations unconnected with agriculture. The educational statistics, which are confessedly imperfect, show 935 males as able to read and write out of a total male population numbering 25,620 souls. Murs\u00e1n originally formed a portion of parganah Jalasar and Koil. In 1838 it contained 208 villages, with a cultivated area amounting to 58,631 acres and a land-revenue of Rs. 1,52,058. Between 1839 and 1868, 17 villages were received from Hathras, and 33 villages were transferred to parganah Mahaban of the Muttra district, 44 villages to Hathras, and 6 to Igl\u00e1s.\n\nPilkhana, a town in parganah Akbarabad of the Aligarh district, is distant 11 miles from Aligarh and 12 miles from Sikandra. In 1865 there were 3,809 inhabitants, and in 1872 there were 4,500. The town is a very old one, and gave its name to a taluka which was farmed to Daya Ram at the commencement of the British rule. In 1817 the taluka was broken up, and the villages were settled with the original proprietors. The Chaukidari Act (XX. of 1856) is in force in Pilkhana, and in 1873 supported a village police numbering 9 men of all grades at an annual cost of Rs. 528. The number of the houses in the town in 1872-73 was 798; and of these 750 were assessed with a house-tax averaging Re. 1-4-4 per house and Re. 0-3-5 per head of the population per annum. The income for the same year was Rs. 1,043,\nincluding a balance of Rs. 88 from the previous year, and the expenditure was Rs. 894.\n\nPis\u00e1wa, a village of parganah Chandaus in the Aligarh district, is distant 26 miles from Aligarh and 6 miles from Chandaus. The population in 1865 numbered 2,428 souls, and in 1872 there were 2,668 inhabitants. Pis\u00e1wa gives its name to a taluka held by J\u00e1tas, an account of whom is given under the district notice. In the neighbourhood there is the only jungle deserving the name in the district.\n\nPurdilnagar, a town in parganah and tahsil Sikandra of the Aligarh district, is 26 miles from Aligarh and 2 miles from Sikandra Rao. The population in 1865 was 3,967, and in 1872 was 4,123. There is a police-station and a post-office. The Chawkidari Act (XX. of 1856) is in force in Purdilnagar, and in 1873 supported a village police numbering 11 men of all grades, at an annual cost of Rs. 636. The number of the houses in the town in 1872-73 was 878; and of these, 811 were assessed with a house-tax averaging Re. 1-2-9 per house and Re. 0-3-9 per head of the population per annum. The income for the same year was Rs. 1,028, including a balance of Rs. 79 from the previous year; and the expenditure was Rs. 915. The Ganges Canal passes close to the town which is named after Naw\u00e1b Purd\u00edl Kh\u00e1n of Sikandra Rao.\n\nSalimpur, a village in parganah and tahsil H\u00e1thras, is distant 11 miles from H\u00e1thras and 90 miles from Aligarh. The population in 1865 was 1,285, and in 1872 was 1,356. There is a police-station here. Salimpur lies on the route between H\u00e1thras and Budaua, distant 10\u00bd miles from H\u00e1thras and 10\u00bd miles from Sikandra Rao, the next stage. The road throughout is metalled and bridged, and the country open and well cultivated. From H\u00e1thras, Sokhu\u00e1r is passed at two miles, the railway at six, and Kailora at 7\u00bd miles. To Sikandra Rao, the Ganges Canal is crossed by a bridge at 6 and 10\u00bd miles. Salimpur is a mere village, and supplies can only be had after due notice. Water is, however, plentiful.\n\nS\u00e1ni, a town in parganah and tahsil H\u00e1thras in the Aligarh district, is distant 14 miles from Aligarh on the Agra road, and 7 miles from H\u00e1thras. The population in 1853 numbered 5,484 souls, in 1865 there were 4,994 inhabitants, and in 1872 there were 4,208. The town is steadily declining in importance. There is a police-station and a district post-office here. S\u00e1ni lies on the route from Agra to Aligarh, 8\u00bd miles from H\u00e1thras and 14\u00bd miles from Aligarh. The encamping-ground for troops is to the west of the town. The road all through is metalled and bridged, and supplies and water are abundant. From H\u00e1thras you pass the Muttra road (Muttra distant 22 miles) at 1\u00bd; Rohari at 4\u00bd, and Barsa at 7 miles. To Aligarh, pass Sushat at 4 miles, Mandr\u00e1k at 6\u00bd, Parh\u00e1wali at 10, road to Muttra at 12, and join the Grand Trunk Road at 12\u00bd miles, after which pass to the east of the\ntown of Koil, to the encamping-ground. The fort, of which the remains exist, was built by the Jat Raja Phup Singh of the Mursan family. Tradition makes him out to have been a person of a very arbitrary disposition. It is said that he was specially proud of his palace garden; and once, when one of his young sons had broken a twig or a leaf from some favourite tree the Raja ordered the lad's arm to be cut off. The Raja's followers however interceded, and the youth was punished by being forced to go about for several days with his sleeves cut short and his arms bare. On another occasion the Raja saw a peasant woman on the road break off the leaf of an overhanging tree to cover the mouth of a pot of ghi she was carrying; whereupon he made her empty the whole pot over the tree, \"to heal,\" as he said, \"the wound she had inflicted.\"\n\nSasni, Akabad, Jalali, and Sikandra Rao, at the beginning of this century, were included in the dominions of the Nawab Wazir of Oudh. They were ceded by treaty in 1802. Raja Bhagwant Singh then held Sasni and Bijaiagarh, and Thakur Harkishan held Kachaura in Sikandra. The then Lieutenant-Governor (Hon'ble Gerald Wellesley) forbade these chiefs to collect transit duties, and offered them a nankar allowance as compensation. They disobeyed, and a force was sent to reduce them. Thereupon the Sasni chief offered to surrender, but secretly made preparations to destroy by treachery the small force (commanded by Colonel Blair) which was sent to occupy the fort. General St. John was then sent against Sasni with a strong force in the winter of 1802, but the place held out until some time in 1803, when it was taken by Lord Lake in person, not without considerable loss. At Sasni are the remains of the monuments erected in memory of Lieutenant Blair and other officers who were killed in the attack on that fort. A great portion of the materials of the fort was used in the building of the Sasni indigo factories in 1806.\n\nThe Chaukidari Act (XX. of 1856) is in force in Sasni, and in 1873 supported a village police numbering 13 men of all grades at an annual cost of Rs. 720. The number of houses in the town in 1872-73 was 1,265, and of these 1,126 were assessed with a house-tax averaging Re. 0-15-10 per house and Re. 0-3-9 per head of the population per annum. The income for the same year was Rs. 1,166, including a balance of Rs. 48 from the previous year, and the expenditure was Rs. 1,047.\n\nSikandra Rao, a town in the parganah of the same name in the Aligarh district, is situated on the Cawnpore road, 23 miles south-east-by-east of Koil. The population in 1847 numbered 7,195, in 1853 it was 12,873, and in 1865 there were 12,451 inhabitants. The site of the town has an area of 140 square acres, giving 96 souls to the acre. According to the census of 1872 there were 12,642 inhabitants, of whom 7,598 were Hindus (3,401 females) and 5,044 were Musalmans (2,573 females). Distributing the population amongst the rural and urban classes, the\nreturns show 321 landholders, 1,499 cultivators, and 10,822 persons pursuing occupations unconnected with agriculture. The number of enclosures in 1872 was 1,516, of which 679 were occupied by Musalm\u00e1ns. The number of houses during the same year was 2,556, of which 493 were built with skilled labour, and of these 197 were occupied by Musalm\u00e1ns. Of the 2,063 mud huts in the town, 815 were owned by Musalm\u00e1ns. Taking the male adult population, 4,064 (not less than fifteen years of age), we find the following occupations pursued by more than fifty males:\u2014Barbers, 61; beggars, 51; butchers, 143; cultivators, 539; inn-keepers, 57; labourers, 647; landowners, 113; letters of vehicles, 181; merchants, 77; oil-makers, 61; servants, 962; shop-keepers, 317; sweepers, 103; water-carriers, 213; weavers 213.\n\nSikandra Rao is rather a squalid, poor looking town, badly situated in low ground, the drainage of which is both difficult and inefficient. To the north there is a high portion, but the south is very low, and on the east there is a great jhil about 600 yards long and 500 yards wide in the cold-weather. In the rains this lake extends fully four miles, and forms one of the sources of the Isan Nadi. It has a considerable depth and abounds with fish. Two ways connect the town with the Grand Trunk Road, one of which, to the north, leads to the tahsili, and the other, to the south, forms the bazarway and the entrance to the business portion of the town. Both are metalled, but are very winding. There are many ruinous houses in the town, especially in the Path\u00e1n quarter, but many new houses are also springing up, especially those belonging to the money-lending classes. The Ganges Canal passes the town about 1\u00bd miles to the west, and has resulted in a greater accumulation of water than ever around the town. The water in the wells is, as a rule, brackish, but in a few wells it is fairly sweet. Since the canal was opened the water level has risen by about twelve feet. Fever prevails, and many die of it every year. Out of a total number of deaths from all causes in 1871, amounting to 287, or 23\u00b708 per thousand of the population, 247 were set down to fever alone. The greater portion of the town lands are also irrigated from the canal, and in the rains the low portion of the site is so subject to flooding that the Grand Trunk Road is the only way always free from water in the neighbourhood. There is a tahsili, police-station, post-office, school, and dispensary here. The tahsili is an enclosed building in the upper portion of the town with the usual public offices. The school and dispensary are poor places. There are four sar\u00e1\u00eds\u2014one inside the town and three on the Grand Trunk Road.\n\nSikandra Rao lies on the route from H\u00e1thras to Bud\u00e1o, 10\u00bd miles from Sall\u00edmpur, the previous stage, and 10 miles from Mohanpur in Eta, the next stage. The road is metalled and bridged throughout, and from Sall\u00edmpur crosses the Ganges Canal by bridges at the 6th and 10\u00bd miles. To Mohanpur, the village of R\u00e1mpur is passed at\n3\u00bd miles, Agaoli at 6\u00bd miles, and the district boundary at 8\u00bd miles. The country throughout is level, open, and cultivated. The encamping-ground at Sikandra Rao is large and spacious, and supplies and water are abundant. Both the Grand Trunk Road and the road from H\u00e1thras by K\u00e1sganj to Soron are used by numbers of pilgrims from Muttra.\n\nSikandra Rao possesses a municipality which is now managed by a committee of nine members, of whom three are official, three are elected by the tax-payers, and three are nominated by the Magistrate. The incidence of taxation in 1872-73 was eight annas and one pie per head of the population. The system has been in force since 1865, and has resulted in much local improvement; in fact, whatever has been done is almost entirely due to the municipality.

It was afterwards given in j\u00e1tir to one Rao Kh\u00e1n, Afgh\u00e1n, and became known as Rao-ke-Sikandra, or Sikandra Rao. The town is divided into two shares, Kasba Naukhel and Kasba Afgh\u00e1nan. The latter contains four pat\u00eds, viz., Um\u00e1 Begam, Muhammad N\u00far Kh\u00e1n, Jam\u00e1y\u00e1t Kh\u00e1n, and M\u00edr\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n. During the mutiny of 1857 Ghaus Kh\u00e1n of Sikandra was one of the principal rebel leaders, and for a long time held Koil itself as deputy of Wali\u00e9d Kh\u00e1n of M\u00e1l\u00e1garh in the Bulandshahr district. Kundan Singh, a Pundir Rajp\u00fat of N\u00e1i, did good service on the British side, and for some time held the parganah in their behalf as N\u00e1zim. He was rewarded for his services, and Debi D\u00e1s, Baniya, also received the thanks of the district authorities for the assistance that he was able to afford. A mosque dating from Akbar\u2019s time was built by the Governor Shahdil Kh\u00e1n, and a ruined house in the town was formerly the residence of another governor, Purd\u00edl Kh\u00e1n; who founded Purdinagar.\n\nSikandra Rao, a parganah in the tahsil of the same name in the Aligarh district, is bounded on the north by parganas Gangiri and Akrabad; on the west by Akrabad and H\u00e1thras; on the south by parganah Jalesar in the Agra district, and on the east by parganahs Mar\u00e1hra and Bilr\u00e1m of the Et\u00e1 district.\n\nThis parganah, according to the statistics of 1872, had then a total area of 141,586 acres, of which 38,473 acres were barren and 1,084 acres were held\nfree of revenue. The assessable area during the same year amounted to 102,029 acres. The changes in area since the last settlement have been great. There are now 164 villages,\u2014an increase due to the absorption of the whole of taluka Husain and a few villages from H\u00e1thras and parganah Mar\u00e1hra of the Kta district. The last settlement of Sikandra Rao proper was made by Mr. Rose in 1838, and as the parganah then stood, the revenue fell at Rs. 2-1-0 on the cultivated acre, the irrigation being 62 per cent. Mr. W. H. Smith made the existing settlement. The statistics of the assessable area are as follows:\n\n| Culturable. | Cultivated. |\n|-------------|-------------|\n| New fallow. | Old waste | Groves. | Total. | Irrigated. | Dry. | Total. | Grand Total. |\n| Acres. | Acres. | Acres. | Acres. | Acres. | Acres. | Acres. | Acres. |\n| 621 | 6,192 | 1,158 | 7,972 | 85,356 | 8,701 | 94,057 | 102,029 |\n\nThese figures show a proportion of culturable land to the total area of 72 per cent., but the proportion of cultivation to the culturable area is as high as 92 per cent., and only 9 per cent. of the cultivation is unirrigated. The margin of waste, including groves, left for the plough is only 8 per cent. of the culturable area. The new assessment amounts to Rs. 2,56,340, and the cesses to Rs. 25,634. The new revenue falls at a rate of Rs. 2-11-0 per cultivated acre. Irrigation has increased immensely since the last settlement. Formerly there were only wells and a few lowlying fields in the valley of the K\u00e1li watered from that river; now the canal commands the entire parganah, but not without certain disadvantages as far as the efflorescence of reh is concerned (see the Tahsil notice).\n\nMr. Rose\u2019s assessment was far less severe than that of Mr. Thornton. The soil throughout the parganah is good, and Mr. Rose\u2019s revision only added eight per cent. to the revenue, whilst the new assessment shows a rise of 37 cent. above the settlement of 1838. The working of the past settlement resulted in the sale by revenue process of 673 acres and the farm of 6,817 acres. The changes by voluntary transfers and the orders of the Civil Courts were as follows:\n\n| Area in acres. | Revenue. | Price per acre. | Years\u2019 purchase. |\n|----------------|----------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Private sale   | 23,496   | Rs. 34,571      | 9 4 10          | 6 3 |\n| Mortgage       | 66,971   | Rs. 88,940      | 5 9 1           | 4 9 |\n| Auction        | 26,305   | Rs. 36,835      | 3 13 10         | 2 7 |\n| Total          | 116,672  | Rs. 1,60,346    | 5 15 10         | 4 3 |\n\n1 I.Sett.Rep. 380; II., Rev. Rep., N. S., 105.\nThe sales for arrears took place very shortly after the settlement in 1838, and the value of land increased after the first ten years, when it was 2\u00bd years' purchase in cases of private sale, to 5\u00bd years' purchase in the second decade, and 11\u00bd years purchase in the third decade. Twenty-four per cent. of the area has been permanently transferred from the original proprietors, and 30 per cent. has been mortgaged. These figures include the whole of the Husain villages formerly settled with the Porach Raja. Puudir Th\u00e1kurs, represented by the talukd\u00e1r of Bijaigarh and the zam\u00ednd\u00e1r of N\u00e1i, are now the most important clan in the two parganahs of Akraabad and Sikandra. But Th\u00e1kurs as a whole have lost 57 per cent. of their old possessions, which covered 165 out of the 259 villages in the tahsil, and 147,760 out of 218,975 acres. Musalm\u00e1ns still hold 13,499 acres in the tahsil, or 47 per cent. of their ancestral lands. The changes however are chiefly from a caste to their fellow-castemen, and not to the money-lenders as in H\u00e1thras.\n\nLarge owners have been more affected by these transfers than small owners, and the conclusion is that it is the tendency of small cultivating proprietors to hold their land where the non-cultivating landholder on a larger scale will be compelled to part with his possessions, and that an assessment which will crush the latter will leave the former comparatively uninjured. The practice of the old settlement officers in sparing the large owners and pressing heavily on the more industrious cultivating communities, if strictly speaking inequitable, was at least based on a sound knowledge of who could and who would not be likely to pay the demand. In this parganah, out of the 79,299 acres transferred, 57,744 acres belonged to individuals owning three-fourths or more of an estate, and similarly all through the district, the smaller proprietary bodies have come well out of the troubles of the past half century. The following statement shows more clearly the nature of the changes in each case:\n\n| Caste | Held in 1838 | Lost between 1838 and 1868 by Sale. | Mortgage, &c. | Total. | Remaining. |\n|-------|--------------|-------------------------------------|---------------|--------|------------|\n|       |              |                                     |               |        |            |\n| Brahman | 6,393        | 1,279                               | 714           | 1,993  | 4,400      |\n| Banjya | 2,652        | 229                                 | 552           | 1,809  | 1,809      |\n| Kayath | 2,311        | 1,816                               | 403           | 1,699  | 516        |\n| Rajp\u00fat | 90,099       | 22,039                              | 39,747        | 55,880 | 40,819     |\n| Dhunar | 2,656        | 1,115                               | 1             | 1,116  | 1,116      |\n| J\u00e1t   | 891          | 891                                 | 891           |        | 891        |\n\nOf the 204 mah\u00e1ls or estates returned as in the parganah at the recent revision of settlement, 129 were zam\u00ednd\u00e1ri, 31 were held on a perfect patt\u00edd\u00e1ri\ntenure, and 44 were imperfect pattidari. One-quarter of the area was held by proprietors possessing more than one village, 28 per cent. by proprietors who were less than six sharers and possessed up to one village, and 47 per cent. by proprietors who were more than six sharers. The percentage of the land-revenue paid by each of these classes is 26, 28-5, and 45-5 per cent. respectively.\n\nKhari crops occupied during the year of measurement (1871) 45,648 acres, and rabi crops 48,409 acres, 12,443 acres were under cotton, 16,204 acres under jodr, and 10,559 acres under indigo in the khari, and in the rabi 23,873 acres were under wheat, 10,099 acres under barley, and 6,364 under bajra. A summary of the prices is given under the district notice for the whole district, where also communications are fully described. 1,148 holdings are held by proprietors as seer, 6,193 by tenants with a right of occupancy, and 2,938 by tenants-at-will. Only 515 acres out of 83,560 acres are paid for in kind, and the average rental per acre at cash rates is Rs. 4-8-8, viz., tenants with a right of occupancy Rs. 4-4-4, and tenants-at-will Rs. 5-1-11 per acre. Twenty-three per cent. of the cultivated area is held as seer by proprietors, 53 per cent. is cultivated by hereditary tenants, and 24 per cent. by tenants-at-will, and the average area of their holding is 18 acres, 8 acres, and 7-8 acres respectively. In 1855 hereditary tenants possessed 4,868 holdings, averaging 8-4 acres each, and tenants-at-will had 3,784 holdings, averaging 8-6 acres each; whilst the rentals showed Rs. 3-13-3 and Rs. 4-15-5 per acre respectively. Rentals have risen, and the size of the holdings has decreased in all cases. In the above remarks taluka Husain is included and the parganah as it now stands.\n\nThe Porach taluka of Husain, now included in this parganah, and in the possession of the Jadon money-lender of Awa Mira, has been noticed in the accounts of the old families of the district. At the revision in 1836 Mr. Thornton followed the same principles that he adopted in other talukas. He found 48 villages in the Raja's name, including three formerly held free of revenue. From 1786 to 1803 the taluka had formed a portion of the jadedd of the Marhatta occupants of the fort of Aligarh, and they collected direct from the village occupants, and neither the Raja nor his family retained more than the three revenue-free villages mentioned above. On the arrival of the British, Mitzen assumed such a position that in the confusion of the time he was recognized as sunder malguzar and admitted to engagements for 1211 faisi (1808-04.A.D.), at a revenue of Rs. 32,600, and again for 1212 faisi at a revenue of Rs. 30,031, and the same terms were allowed up to the end of 1215. In the beginning of 1216 faisi (1808-09) Mr. Elliott made a revision of the settlement and drew up a proceeding in which the Raja is recorded to have promised to permit the old proprietors to retain possession of their lands.\n\n1 Set. Rep., I., 338.\nat a reasonable revenue. The names of the proprietors, where ascertainable, were entered in the record, and the Raja was styled \"talukadar mustajir,\" at a revenue of Rs. 31,001, rising to Rs. 37,001 in the third year. This assessment was continued until 1222 fasli. A money-lender then obtained possession of the estate and held it from 1228 to 1227 at a revenue of Rs. 44,000, and was succeeded by Jaswant Singh, and finally by Narayan Singh, who was alive in 1836. The arrangements made by Mr. Elliott seem never to have been acted on, and the only enquiries subsequently set on foot were made with the object of extracting as much as possible from the villages, to prop up the declining fortunes of the Raja's house and to support him in his extravagance.\n\nIn applying the principles adopted in the case of Mursan to Husain, Mr. Thornton found that the Raja had never by any valid or sufficient means acquired any proprietary rights in the taluka. His position rested neither upon a grant from Government nor upon any private and voluntary transfer on the part of the people themselves. Originally without any possessions in the taluka, he received a farm from an agent of one of the short-lived governments of the time, and remained in possession for only seventeen years. This was followed by a time of deprivation for a similar period, so that the reinstatement of Mitrsen in 1803-04 must be considered to have been merely conditional and temporary, and five years after it was distinctly stated to be so when he was allowed to renew his engagement. Mr. Thornton then began his inquiry into the history of each village, and his account throws such light upon the history of village colonization that I quote him here:\u2014\"I was enabled, with few exceptions, to discover with great certainty to what tribe and family each village originally belonged. In many cases I could trace that gradual spread of cultivation from a central point, and consequent formation of new villages as offsets from the one first established, which affords such undeniable proof of the rights of those who in times past thus appropriated and parcelled out the soil. I had also procured from several distinct and unconnected sources a number of old records, which showed the names of the malguzars by whom each village had been held under the former Government, together with the title then assigned to them. The mudif records furnished further evidence, as the numerous holders of these small rent-free portions of land, which are almost entirely the gift of the zamindars, had been called upon some years ago to state the date of the grant with the name of the giver. It was thus frequently made evident that the ancestors of those who now claimed in opposition to the Raja had held as zamindars before the taluka was made over to Ratan Singh, as well as afterwards during Mitrsen's dispossession. The results of all this evidence were further corroborated by the papers given in by the kanungoes in 1216 fasli, as well as by the unanimous and uncontradicted testimony of the surrounding inhabitants.\" Though the above\nALIGARH DISTRICT:\n\nInvestigation showed the communities to which the soil belonged, the descendants of those old proprietors were not forthcoming in many instances; and in others were too long out of possession to admit of their being reinstated. In seventeen only of the forty-three estates in the taluka were the old proprietors restored, and the remainder were settled with the Raja as zamindar. \"The continuance of the Raja in this position,\" writes Mr. Thornton, \"must be considered a matter of favour on the part of Government rather than of actual right on the part of the Raja, but his ancient descent and the former condition of his family confer upon him a title to consideration. It so happens, moreover, that if the talukadari allowance be granted for the life of the present incumbent, its future diminution or entire cessation will be felt much less severely than if it took place at present.\" The entire Government demand was lowered from Rs. 44,000 to Rs. 41,558, falling at a rate of Rs. 2-6-7 on the cultivated acre, with 63 per cent. of irrigation. After much litigation the whole of the taluka has fallen into the hands of the Muttra J\u0101dons, and the only representative of the old family, now, is a childless widow. The biswadari villages formerly paid Rs. 15,950 plus malik\u0101na, Rs. 4,627, or a total of Rs. 20,577, and the revenue of the other villages was Rs. 25,608. The present settlement shows an assessment of Rs. 21,990 on the biswadari villages, or an increase of 37 per cent. plus Rs. 2,199 as malik\u0101na, which has been reduced from 22-5 per cent. on the revenue to 10 per cent., so that the whole increase now amounts to only 17 per cent. on the biswadari village. The zamindari villages are now assessed at Rs. 23,684, or by 18 per cent., and the whole increase in revenue is therefore 25 per cent., and the incidence on cultivation is Rs. 2-13-9 per acre. The villages composing the taluka are among the richest in quality and the most carefully cultivated in the parganah; rents too have been gradually raised to a high pitch by the farming system adopted by the present owner.\n\nAccording to the census of 1872 pargarah Sikandra Rao contained 160 inhabited villages, of which 22 had less than 200 inhabitants; 60 had between 200 and 500; 40 had between 500 and 1,000; 29 had between 1,000 and 2,000; 3 had between 2,000 and 3,000; and 5 had between 3,000 and 5,000.\n\nThe settlement records show that there were 100 mahals or estates in this parganah in 1874, and 164 villages, having an average area of 863 acres each. The total population in 1872 numbered 128,864 souls (58,829 females), giving 566 to the square mile. Classified according to religion, there were 115,473 Hind\u016bs, of whom 52,383 were females; 13,864 Musalmans, amongst whom 6,432 were females; and 27 Christians. Distributing the Hind\u016b population amongst the four great classes, the census shows 10,859 Brahmans, of whom 4,729 were females; 15,812 Rajputs, including 6,767 females; 5,543 Baniyas (2,547 females); whilst the great mass of the population is included in\n\"the other castes\" of the census returns, which show a total of 83,259 souls, of whom 38,340 are females. The principal Brahman subdivisions found in this parganah are the Gaun (190), Saraswat (80), Sanadh (1,452), and Kanaujiya. The Rajputs belong to the Gahlot (656), Chauhan (4,109), Badgajjar (380), Jadon (4,052), Janghara (166), Pundir (4,136), Gaharwar (319), Bais Gaur, Tomar, Solankhi, Rathor, Panwar, Jaiswar, Sikkharwar, Bangar, Kirar, and Surajbansi clans; and the Baniyas to the Agarwal (1,023), Dasa, Chausaini (246), Maheeri (452), Barahsaini (840), Garwal, Jaiswar, Sarangi, and Lohiya. Amongst the other castes the following show more than 1,000 members each:\u2014Barhai (2,778), Hajjam, Kalai (2,976), Ahir (9,010), Kachhi (3,635), Kahar (3,561), Koli (3,622), Chamari (25,545), Khakroo, Kumhar, Garariya (8,299), Aheriya (1,369), Kayath and Lodha (5,007). The following have less than 1,000 and more than 100 members:\u2014Jat, Sonar, Raj, Mali, Bhat, Gosain, Joshi, Darzi, Jogi, Bairagi, Dhobi, Khatik, Banjara, Dhuna, Bharbhunja, Mallah, Teli, Kanjar, and Ghosi. The Musalmans are distributed amongst Shaikha (2,210), Sayyids (310), Mughals (289), Pathans (1,775), and unspecified beyond religion.\n\nThe occupations of the people are shown in the statistics collected at the census of 1872. From these it appears that of the male adult population (not less than fifteen years of age) 410 are employed in professional avocations, such as Government servants, priests, doctors, and the like; 5,191 in domestic service, as personal servants, water-carriers, barbers, sweepers, washermen, &c.; 2,057 in commerce, in buying, selling, keeping or lending money or goods, or the conveyance of men, animals or goods; 19,795 in agricultural operations; 5,438 in industrial occupations, arts and mechanics, and the preparation of all classes of substances, vegetable, mineral, and animal. There were 8,391 persons returned as labourers and 874 as of no specified occupation. Taking the total population, irrespective of age or sex, the same returns give 3,298 as landholders, 54,745 as cultivators, and 70,821 as engaged in occupations unconnected with agriculture. The educational statistics, which are confessedly imperfect, show 2,278 males as able to read and write out of a total male population numbering 70,035 souls. Parganah Sikandra now includes taluka Hussain.\n\nSikandra Rao, a tahsil of the Aligarh district, comprises parganahs Sikandra Rao and Akabad. The total area according to the settlement records is 215,812 acres, of which 1,237 acres are held free of revenue and 57,642 acres are barren. The assessable area comprises 156,938 acres, of which 143,909 acres are cultivated (130,991 acres irrigated) and 13,024 acres are culturable. Of the latter 1,629 acres are under groves. The amount of barren land is larger than in any other tahsil in the district. The percentage of culturable land to the total area is only 73, but the area under cultivation is 93 per cent. of the\ncultivable area, and irrigation reaches 91 per cent. of the cultivated area. There is very little land left either unirrigated or uncultivated in this tahsil. Fifteen per cent. of the cultivation is manured, and there is only 4 per cent. of poor unirrigated sandy land in the tahsil. The population in 1872 numbered 193,611 souls (88,560 females), giving 566 souls to the square mile, distributed amongst 247 inhabited villages. The old revenue demand amounted to Rs. 2,80,587; the new assessment gives a land-revenue of Rs. 3,87,320, falling at a rate of Rs. 2-11-0 on the cultivated acre, or Rs. 2-11-7 for Sikandra and Rs. 2-10-0 in Akabad, as compared with a former incidence of Rs. 2-1-0 and Re. 1-14-11 per acre respectively. The census statistics show 471 persons blind, 39 lepers, 26 deaf and dumb, 4 idiots, and 10 insane persons in the tahsil.\n\nThe division into parganahs is purely nominal: neither has preserved its ancient limits, and both are wholly alike in general character, and have been subject to the same influences during the past settlement. Mr. Smith thus describes the present character of the subdivision:\u2014\"The tahsil lies exactly on the watershed of the Du\u00e1b, and the soil is almost uniformly good loam. Two small tracts form the only exceptions of any importance: one the rising ground above the lowlands of the K\u00e1li Nadi, which for the breadth of, perhaps, from a quarter to half a mile is generally composed of bh\u00e1r or sand; the other a sandy ridge running from Husain due south into Jalesar. Elsewhere, in a few villages only is there any bh\u00e1r at all, and then over only limited areas. The proportion of sand throughout the subdivision is very small indeed, and the soils as a whole may be considered a rich and fertile loam.\n\nThe Cawnpore and Et\u00e1wa branches of the Ganges Canal run along its highest level. These two lines branch out from the main canal at N\u00e1nu, close to the Koil boundary, and flow through the tahsil at a distance of about four miles apart. Distributaries from the upper canal, as well as from the two lower branches, command the vast majority of the villages in both parganahs, and no part of the district, H\u00e1thras alone excepted, is so amply supplied with every capability for easy irrigation. Of the whole irrigated area rather more than half is watered from the canal. A great change has thus been worked in the character of this tract of country. At last settlement there was, on the whole, indeed, a fair amount of irrigation. Of the cultivated area, 61 per cent. was irrigated from masonry and temporary wells; but facilities for obtaining water were unequally distributed. As remarked by Mr. Hutchinson, numbers of the estates were of such a nature that the formation of kuchha wells was impracticable; masonry wells were necessary over much of the area, and the general expense of irrigation was consequently heavy. At the present time nearly every village obtains an adequate amount of water. Masonry wells are still\n\n---\n\n1 See Rev. Rep., N. S., II, 108.\nin use, though few new ones are constructed. Where kuchcha wells were formerly sunk at will canal-water is generally substituted: and villages where there was originally no irrigation at all are now covered with a net-work of canal-feeders. The productive power of the soil has been largely increased. In one tract, however, considerable damage has been done by the canal. Throughout the tahsil \u00fasar plains form 21 per cent. of the entire area, and since the introduction of the canal their character has changed very much, while reh, which formerly never exuded to any appreciable extent, has effloresced extensively and covered the ground with a brittle crust, looking like snow in the distance. This reh, which had previously confined itself to the \u00fasar alone, has now cropped up on cultivated as well as barren lands, and is yearly throwing numerous fields out of cultivation. More than one hamlet has become wholly\n\nInjurious efflorescence waste, and has been deserted by its former residents; of reh and fields which three years ago (1871) were surveyed as cultivated were at the time of inspection covered with white soda exudations. As yet this damage is compensated on the whole by the extra irrigation supplied by the canal to the soil which still remains unaffected, and the recorded rent-rolls show that the people, complain as they may, have, as a rule, suffered no sensible loss. But this state of things cannot last: the reh will increase, and in the end, though probable after many years, a great part of this tract must, in the opinion of the Settlement Officer, become waste. The efflorescence of reh may be due to the stoppage of the natural drainage of the country, or it may arise from the water-logging of the soil from percolation between the canals or excessive canal irrigation. The popular idea is that the canal-water collects reh in solution during its course and deposits it over the cultivation, and that during the rainy reason the rains have the same effect. In this district reh is never found except in a certain proximity to \u00fasar plains, and (it may therefore be assumed) where reh already exists somewhere in the soil. Again, it exudes in profusion where the soil is moist and swampy; as, for instance, on the lowlands along the side of the Rind, where scarcely a field has been left uninjured. The weed boiawari is found in a small portion of Hussain near the borders of H\u00e1thras and Jalesar, and does not appear to affect the cultivation. All other particulars regarding this tahsil will be found under the parganah notices or in the district notice.\n\nSomna, a town in parganah and tahsil Khair of the Aligarh district, is distant on the Grand Trunk Road 14 miles from Aligarh and 11 miles from Khair. The population in 1865 was 1832, and in 1872 was 2,038. There is a police-station here and a post-office, also a station of the East Indian Railway. The elevation above the sea is 752 feet. Somna lies on the route by Kh\u00e1rja from Aligarh to Dehli, distant 14\u00bd miles from Aligarh and 12\u00bd miles\nfrom Kh\u00farja. The road is metalled throughout and bridged. From Aligarh the road passes Bh\u00e1nkri at 6 miles and Ch\u00faharpur 11 miles. Hence to Kh\u00farja it passes the Aligarh district at 2\u00bd miles; Kirauta (59th milestone from Debl\u00ed), 6 miles; Dasara (56th milestone), 9 miles; Meerut road within half a mile of Kh\u00farja (Meerut distant 58\u00bd miles, or five marches) Railway Station, 3\u00bd miles from Kh\u00farja. The Chaukid\u00e1ri Act (XX. of 1856) is in force in Somna, and in 1873 supported a village police numbering five men of all grades, at an annual cost of Rs. 288. The number of the houses in the town in 1872-73 was 442, and of these 417 were assessed with a house-tax averaging Re. 1-4-5 per house and Re. 0-4-0 per head of the population per annum. The income for the same year was Rs. 593, including a balance of Rs. 60 from the previous year, and the expenditure was Rs. 582.\n\nTappal, a town in parganah Tappal and tahsli Khair of the Aligarh district, is situated near the Jumna, 32 miles from Aligarh and 18 miles from Khair. The population in 1853 was 5,941, and in 1845 was 5,744. In 1872 there were 6,028 inhabitants, of whom 4,057 were Hind\u00fas (1,998 females) and 1,966 were Musalm\u00e1ns (1,067 females). The town site occupies 89 square acres, giving 68 souls to the acre. The town is built on the old high bank of the Jumna, which now runs four miles to the west. The inhabitants are chiefly Rajputs, Musalm\u00e1ns, and Brahmans. The ways are unmetalled, and, with the exception of about fifty houses, the buildings are ruinous and neglected. The town is entered on the north-east by a low sandy road, which, as it rises with the rising site, divides into two branches, circling round to rejoin in the midst of the town. Where they meet is the bazar with a few poor-looking shops. The whole town is a decaying one with no trade, and only occasionally used by carts passing to the gh\u00e1t on the Jumna. There is a school, a police-station, and a post-office. The well water stands at 35 feet from the surface and is remarkably good. The Chaukid\u00e1ri Act (XX. of 1856) is in force in Tappal, and in 1873 supported a village police numbering 11 men of all grades at an annual cost of Rs. 636. The number of the houses in the town in 1872-73 was 1,279, and of these 1,149 were assessed with a house-tax averaging Re. 1-2-10 per house and Re. 0-3-7 per head of the population per annum. The income for the same year was Rs. 1,492, including a balance of Rs. 140 from the previous year, and the expenditure was Rs. 1,278. Tappal in former days was a place of some note. Towards the edge of the high land separating it from the kh\u00e1dir of the Jumna are the remains of a very large old fort said to have been built some eight hundred years ago, and to the north-east of the town, where the police-station now stands, are the remains of another fort which formerly belonged to Begam Sumru, the j\u00e1gird\u00e1r of parganah Tappal, and was the residence of her amil. In the early days of British rule the town was the residence of a tahsild\u00e1r, but the collecting\nestablishment now reside at Khair, and since then the town has steadily declined in importance.\n\nTappal, a parganah in tahsil Khair of the Aligarh district, is bounded on the north by the Bulandshahr district; on the south by the Muttra district; on the east by Chandaus and Khair of this district; and on the west by the Jumna, which separates it from the Panjab. According to the census of 1872 this parganah had then a total area of 149 square miles and 29 acres, of which 106 square miles and 29 acres were under cultivation. The area assessed to Government revenue during the same year was 149 square miles, of which 106 square miles were cultivated, 30 square miles were culturable, and 18 square miles were barren.\n\nThe Jumna kh\u00e1dir in this parganah varies in breadth from two to seven miles. Formerly subject to constant inundation, it now lies high above the river-bed, and even the lower portions are, now, submerged only in seasons of unusual flood. Close to the river's edge changes occasionally occur from diluvion or alluvion, but the newly formed soil is fertile, and the crops on it are certain. The old soil is hard and firm, and only its purely recent formation differs from the uplands. It requires the same care and skill in cultivation as the dry upland. Parallel with the kh\u00e1dir and along the extreme edge of the uplands there is a narrow strip of poor sandy soil, and beyond it commences the large loamy tract of the Du\u00e1b. Whilst on the Ganges side the kh\u00e1dir is usually rich and moist, and the bh\u00e1r above is remarkably poor and of a considerable extent, by the Jumna the kh\u00e1dir is very inferior, and the sandy upland small in quantity and comparatively fertile. The depth of water from the surface in the uplands is from 35 to 60 feet, and the substratum is so sandy that wells, if not of masonry, can only be made, as a general rule, with stages of wooden frames. These are expensive, but they last for many years. In the kh\u00e1dir water throughout is close to the surface, but the substratum is composed of such loose sandy soil that any but pukka wells are almost useless. The dh\u00e9ngli or lever is used here in dry seasons, but the small wells fall in so soon and irrigate so small an area that they are little used. The new formation on the edge of the river-bed seldom requires artificial irrigation, and, when necessary, small percolation wells are dug.\n\nThe existing settlement of Tappal was made by Mr. W. H. Smith. The statistics of area show a total area of 95,499 acres, of which 8,077 acres are recorded as unculturable. Of the assessable area the distribution is as follows:\n\n| Cultivable | Cultivated |\n|------------|-----------|\n| New fallow | Old waste | Groves | Total | Irrigated | Dry | Total | Grand Total |\n| Acres | Acres | Acres | Acres | Acres | Acres | Acres | Acres |\n| 541 | 18,569 | 146 | 19,256 | 31,377 | 26,789 | 68,166 | 87,422 |\nThe proportion of culturable land to the total area is 91 per cent., but the proportion of cultivation to the culturable area is only 78 per cent., showing a very large margin of waste land not yet brought under the plough (22 per cent.), but much of this is the hard old waste of the khadir now under thatching grass and scarcely culturable. Irrigation reaches only 46 per cent. of the cultivated area. The land-revenue as now assessed amounts to Rs. 1,36,090, and the cesses to Rs. 18,609. The new land-revenue falls at Re. 1-15-11 per cultivated acre, and gives a rise of 14 per cent. on the old revenue (Rs. 1,19,343). Irrigation has increased by 78-7 per cent., and cultivation by 18-8 per cent., since last settlement. Of the 99 estates existing at the recent settlement, 24 were held in zamindari tenure, 73 in imperfect pattidari, and 2 in perfect pattidari, and of all these only 2-34 per cent. of the revenue was paid by landholders possessing one or more villages. The following table shows the losses that have fallen upon the proprietary body as it stood in 1838 between that date and 1868:\n\n| Caste | Area held in 1838 | Area transferred | Area held in 1868 |\n|-------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n|       | Acres            | Acres            | Acres            |\n| Jat   | ...              | 63,468           | 15,464           |\n| Brahman | ...          | 3,770            | 2,068            |\n| Rajput | ...              | 10,139           | 6,348            |\n\nThe lands held by Jats and Jadons have usually passed to members of the same clans, whilst those lost by Chauhans have, as a rule, passed into the hands of strangers.\n\nTappal, up to 1836, formed a portion of Begam Sumru's jagir. It was resumed on her death and was summarily settled by Mr. Thornton, who reduced the demand from Rs. 1,34,625 to Rs. 1,15,489. The first regular settlement was made in 1840 by Mr. Wright, who raised the revenue to Rs. 1,18,206. Since then the boundaries have been changed, and on the expiration of the old settlement the revenue stood at Rs. 1,19,064. The revenue of the villages now constituting the parganah was from 1835-36 to 1839-40 fixed at Rs. 1,18,254, and in the following year the assessment was fixed at Rs. 1,19,343. \"The change from the lax and variable character of the Begam's management,\" writes Mr. Smith, \"to the rigidity of our system excited a dangerous and what, in these times, would have been a fatal influence on the fortunes of the Jat proprietors.\"\nAccustomed to annual remissions when they could obtain them, or temporary flight and evasion of payment when the jagirdar's collections were obdurate, they soon fell into arrears under the regular demands of their new masters. More than one-third of the parganah was either sold for arrears of revenue or farmed during the first ten years (1838-39 to 1847-48) of the regular settlement, and this was purely revenue process, and is apart from all consideration of private sales or mortgages and the action of the civil courts. Out of a total area of 87,982 acres 33,657 were thus treated, and the sales at auction involving 21,405 acres only fetched an average price of 10 annas 5 pie per acre. Fortunately the very magnitude of the evil seems to have been its own cure. Outsiders either considered the property in the parganah worthless, or they were afraid to enter so close a borough as the Jat clans of Tappal. Government was compelled itself to purchase some of the estates at the nominal price of a rupee; others were bought at almost equally nominal prices by the near relations of the defaulters; others, the defaulters themselves, purchased under false names. Those which were bought by Government were farmed out in some cases to the connections of the recusant owners, in others to individuals of the defaulting community. In some way or other all, or nearly all, these estates came back to the original owners or to their close relations. By the second decade of the settlement there was no difference between the fiscal condition of Tappal and that of the neighbouring parganahs, except that in the former the proportion of transfers was small and the circumstances of the proprietors comparatively prosperous. Only 2,977 acres were farmed and 998 sold for arrears of revenue between 1256 and 1265 fasi, and the price obtained per acre (Rs. 6-13-2) was fair for the time. Since the last date there have been no revenue sales, and 5,840 acres only have been farmed. Singular enough, in no parganah in the district were there within so short a period so many coercive revenue processes, and in no other parganah has so much property in the end been found to remain in the hands of its original owners. Out of 69 villages held by Jats at the commencement of the expiring settlement, three only have been invaded by intruders of other castes; 66 are still held solely by Jats, and in the remaining three the same caste still holds shares. Not one estate has been wholly lost. Had the parganah been well known to the neighbouring capitalists, or had the value of the land been recognized, as it is now, large communities of the most deserving and industrious cultivating proprietors that we possess would have been reduced to the condition of mere tenants-at-will. Fortunately for their preservation the money-lenders of adjoining districts were too suspicious to speculate, and at that time the ownership of land was a thing of small consideration to outsiders. The Jats therefore still remain and still hold three-fourths of the parganah. The remissions found\nnecessary during the 32 years amount to the small sum of Rs. 6,143 only. In 1855-56 the crops were terribly damaged by a violent hailstorm, and Rs. 4,505 were remitted. The remission of Rs. 1,637 is due to the famine of 1860-61.\"\n\nThe following statement shows the mode of transfer, the average price per acre, and the average number of years' purchase of the land-revenue brought by the areas transferred between 1838 and 1868. It is to be noted that if a single plot or estate has changed hands ten times, ten entries have been made in this account:\n\n| Mode of transfer | 1839-48 | 1849-58 | 1859-68 |\n|------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n|                  | Acres   | Price per acre | Years' purchase | Acres   | Price per acre | Years' purchase | Acres   | Price per acre | Years' purchase |\n| Private sale     | 718     | 2 14 8 | 2 49    | 4,756   | 4 18 3 | 4 18           | 12,439  | 6 15 11 | 5 41         |\n| Mortgage         | 6,570   | 4 7 5 | 3 21    | 2,690   | 8 3 10 | 4 23           | 4,312   | 8 12 9 | 5 9         |\n| Auction sale     | 1,803   | 4 8 10| 2 64    | 2,018   | 8 15 1 | 4 91           | 2,543   | 8 8 8 | 4 25        |\n| Total            | 9,091   | 4 4 9 | 3 8     | 9,466   | 6 10 9 | 4 28           | 19,084  | 7 8 11 | 5 35        |\n\nThe average price per acre during the last twelve years of the expired settlement has been 75-8 per cent. higher than during the first eleven years. It was only in the last decade that the value of land in this parganah began to be properly estimated. Altogether 62 per cent. of the area bearing the same percentage of the land-revenue had been permanently alienated in 1869, and 5 per cent. of the area bearing the same percentage of the revenue was mortgaged. Out of 32,596 acres transferred, 20,940 acres belonged to proprietors of three-fourths or more of a village, whilst the smaller proprietors have escaped. Forty-six per cent. of the cultivated area is occupied by kharif crops, and amongst these jodr covers 21 per cent. of the total cultivated area, cotton 12 per cent., bajra 7 per cent., and moth 5 per cent. Amongst the rabi crops, wheat occupies 16 per cent. of the total cultivated area, bajar 24 per cent., and barley 4 per cent. 7,258 acres, or 10 per cent. of the cultivation, are leased on payments in kind. The system is confined to small, and generally the worst, portions of poor villages and on the lowlands of the Jumna, and, except in a few instances, to soil newly broken up for cultivation, where the returns are very uncertain. Very little irrigated land is held on division of produce, and here, as elsewhere in the district, the system is gradually dying out. There were 12,741 bulls and bullocks, 9,115 buffaloes, 9,206 cows, 852 horses, and 9,970 sheep and\ngoats in the parganah in 1869. 2,082 holdings are entered as the seer of proprietors, 1,263 are held by hereditary tenants, and 2,841 by tenants-at-will, with an average area of 14\u00b76 acres, 15 acres, and 9\u00b75 acres respectively. The average rental where cash is paid amounts to Rs. 3-4-3 per acre; hereditary tenants pay on an average Rs. 3-2-9 per acre, whilst tenants-at-will pay Rs. 3-4-10 per acre. Altogether 45 per cent. of the cultivated area is held by cultivating proprietors. At the commencement of the expired settlement there were only 120 holdings possessed by hereditary tenants, with an average area of 14\u00b72 acres and an average rental of Rs. 2-1-6 per acre, whilst tenants-at-will held 2,090 holdings, with an average area of 12\u00b72 acres and an average rental of Rs. 2-5-8 per acre. The areas possessed by each class in 1839 and 1869 were as follows:\n\n|                  | 1839 |       | 1869 |       |\n|------------------|------|-------|------|-------|\n|                  | Area | Rent  | Area | Rent  |\n| Hereditary tenants| ...  | ...   | 1,701| 3,581 |\n| Tenants-at-will  | ...  | ...   | 87,771| 89,006|\n\nAccording to the census of 1872 parganah Tappal contained 89 inhabited villages, of which 16 had less than 200 inhabitants; 34 had between 200 and 500; 25 had between 500 and 1,000; 9 had between 1,000 and 2,000; and 4 had between 2,000 and 3,000. The settlement records show that there were 100 mahals or estates in the parganah in 1874, and 91 villages, with an average area of 1,049 acres; the largest having 6,305 acres, and the smallest having 84 acres. The average area is here increased by the great size of the kh\u00e1dir villages. The total population in 1872 numbered 58,809 souls (27,378 females), giving 395 to the square mile. Classified according to religion, there were 54,251 Hind\u00fas, of whom 25,130 were females; 4,558 Musalm\u00e1ns, amongst whom 2,248 were females. Distributing the Hind\u00fa population amongst the four great classes, the census shows 8,410 Brahmins, of whom 3,857 were females; 1,312 Rajp\u00fats, including 603 females; 2,618 Baniyas (1,254 females); whilst the great mass of the population is included in \u201cthe other castes\u201d of the census returns, which show a total of 41,911 souls, of whom 19,416 are females. The principal Brahman subdivisions found in this parganah are the Gaur (7,946), Saraswat (12). The Rajp\u00fats are chiefly of the Chauh\u00e1n (697), Badg\u00fajar (72), Gahlot, Jangh\u00e1ra, J\u00e1don, and Panw\u00e1r clans, and the Baniyas belong to the Dasa (636), Agarw\u00e1l (1,346), and Gur\u00e1ku subdivisions. Amongst the other castes the following have more than 1,000 members each:\u2014J\u00e1t (16,900), Barhai, Hajj\u00e1m, Koli (1,382), Cham\u00e1r (9,160),\nKhatik (2,881), and Kh\u00e1krob (1,627). The following have more than 100 members each:\u2014Son\u00e1r, M\u00e1l\u00ed, Bhat, Kal\u00e1l, Darzi, Kah\u00e1r, Jog\u00ed, Bair\u00e1g\u00ed, Dhobi, Loh\u00e1r, Kumbh\u00e1r, Garariya, Orh, Dhuna, Mall\u00e1h, and Teli. The Musalm\u00e1ns are entered as Shaikhs (384) and Path\u00e1ns (327). The remainder is shown without distinction.\n\nThe occupations of the people are shown in the statistics collected at the census of 1872. From these it appears that of the male adult population (not less than fifteen years of age) 172 are employed in professional avocations, such as Government servants, priests, doctors, and the like; 1,658 in domestic service, as personal servants, water-carriers, barbers, sweepers, washermen, &c.; 1,139 in commerce, in buying, selling, keeping or lending money or goods, or the conveyance of men, animals, or goods; 10,853 in agricultural operations; 2,059 in industrial occupations, arts and mechanics, and the preparation of all classes of substances, vegetable, mineral, and animal. There were 2,389 persons returned as labourers, and 585 as of no specified occupation. Taking the total population, irrespective of age or sex, the same returns give 938 as landholders, 31,855 as cultivators, and 26,016 as engaged in occupations unconnected with agriculture. The educational statistics, which are confessedly imperfect, show 1,337 males as able to read and write out of a total male population numbering 31,431 souls.\n\nThe boundaries of Tappal have seen many changes. In 1838 the parganah comprised 90 villages, with an area of 90,416 acres and a land-revenue of Rs. 1,17,913. In 1840-41, 13 villages were transferred to parganah Jewar in the Bulandshahr district, and in 1851-52 one village was handed over to Khair. In 1840-41, 15 villages were received from parganah Jewar, leaving Tappal possessed of 91 villages. Tappal has been the residence of a J\u00e1t colony for many centuries. Originally settling in Khandiya, they have spread over all this parganah, and though, at first, the action of the past settlement threatened to overwhelm them, they are now more flourishing than ever.\nGLOSSARY OF VERNACULAR TERMS USED IN THIS VOLUME.\n\nA.\n\nAbi, irrigated from tanks and rivers, 379.\nAbw\u0101s, cesses, 35.\nAdh\u0101hal, a plough with one pair of bullocks (S'pur),
