Some fifty or sixty years afterwards the Gaur Chhattirs took it, and ever since it has been held by them, and is the headquarters of the taluqdar of Katesar. It is 20 miles from Sitapur to the north-east, and 3 miles north-west from L\u00e1harpur, on the cross-country road which joins that town to Harg\u00edm. It has no other communications, but one mile to the west is the river Kew\u00e1ni, which is navigable during the greater part of the year. It is a poor place, with only one masonry house in it, the taluqdar's residence; the mud houses being 323, and the population 2,649.\n\nThe only public building is the school. And the only sacred place in it is a tank, on the brink of which stands a mean Hindu temple.\n\nThere are no shopkeepers in the town with the exception of the Bani\u00e1n, who supplies the taluqdar's establishment.\n\nThe inhabitants get their necessaries from Kesirganj, which was founded by Kesri Singh, grandfather to the present taluqdar; and which lies between this town and L\u00e1harpur.\n\nThe annual value of the yearly sales being close upon Rs. 1,00,000.\n\nNAGR\u00c1M.\u2014Pargana Mohanlalganj\u2014Tahsil Mohanlalganj\u2014District Lucknow.\u2014Situated at the extreme eastern boundary of the pargana, about midway between the two roads from Lucknow to Sultanpur and Rae Bareli. The date of its foundation is unknown, but it is said to have been called after R\u00e1ja Nal, a Bhar chieftain, who had a large fort here, the site of which, a high mound in the centre of the village, still exists. For some considerable time the village appeared in the Government records as Nalgram, so the tradition assigning the foundation to R\u00e1ja Nal is a well attested historical fact. It seems to have fallen in the track of Sayyad S\u00e1l\u00e1r's invasion; for on the mound of the fort are the graves of Munawwar and Anwar Shahids, and outside is the tomb of Pir\u00e1n H\u00e1ji Burd, and a \"Ganj Shah\u00edd\u00e1n,\" or \"martyr gathering.\" There is no proof that Sayyad S\u00e1l\u00e1r's conquest was in any way permanent. The place seems to have been left to the Bhars, and was subsequently occupied by\n\n* By Mr. M. L. Ferrar, C.S., Assistant Commissioner.\nthe Kumhr\u00e1w\u00e1n Amethias, a branch of the family established at Amethi D\u00edngur. They were led by Jaip\u00e1l Singh, and were probably driven out by the same Musalman invasion that established the Ans\u00e1ri Shekhs in Amethi at about the end of the 15th century. But the Rajputs did not forget their rights nor the solemn duties of prosecuting the blood feud which they had inherited. Twice afterwards\u2014once in the reign of Farrukh Siar when they were led by Sher and Baghar Singh, and fought a battle at the Gurha tank, called after this the Ran-i-Gurha, the Gurha of the fight, and again in the time of Alamgir II., under Chhatar Dhar and Gobar Singh\u2014did they attack the village, and the second time with some success, for they secured four villages which they still hold, and established an impost called Satr\u00e1h of Rs. 4 on the shopkeeper, and Rs. 24, a road cess, on the inhabitants of Nagr\u00e1m, which was maintained throughout the Nawabi. In the reign of Akbar, Nagr\u00e1m was made the centre of a pargana, and was not broken up till the time of \u00c1sif-ud-daula in 1789 A.D. With this administration came the usual accompaniment of pargana officials\u2014chaudhris, q\u00e1z\u00eds, muftis, mutawallis. The latter three offices were conferred on members of the chief Sayyad family that had assisted in the invasion, and who now hold two out of the three tarafs of the village. In addition to the tombs already mentioned, there is that of Miran Shah, a Sayyad, the founder of the Sayyad family, and some lesser ones erected to the faq\u00edrs of the village who have died here. The town is of very considerable size, the population numbering nearly 5,000 souls, of which a very fair population are Musalmans. All the trades are fairly represented, but there are in special some 14 families of a K\u00e1yath class called professionally Koh-h\u00e1l, who practice the profession of oculist, and are held in great repute. The annual bazar sales amount to, 35,500, and the chief article of sale is rice, which is largely grown in the neighbourhood. In the old d\u00e1k, the site of the fort, stands the Government school which overlooks the village. The people seems to evince some appreciation of education, for, in addition to the boys' school there is a girls' school. The town presents a somewhat runious appearance, for the old masonry houses of the Musalmans are not rebuilt, and probably the Musalmans are poorer than they were. The country round is fairly wooded, and finely cultivated towards the south. But to the north the land is very low and marshy, though well adapted for rice cultivation.\n\nN\u00c1IN\u2014Pargana SALON\u2014Tahsil SALON\u2014District RA\u00c9 BARELI.\u2014This village was founded by Naini, an Ah\u00edr\u00edn, about 500 years ago. It is two miles north of the road from Salon to Rae Bareli, fourteen miles from Rae Bareli. This place is now the headquarters of a branch of the Kanhpuria clan, the most turbulent Chhattirs in Oudh. In 1802, there was a fight between the chakladar Shukr-ulla and Ishuri Bakhsh. In 1815, another fight occurred with Ihs\u00e1n Ali, chakladar. In 1833, Mirza K\u00e1zim, chakladar, again attacked the fort. In 1826, N\u00e1zm Darshan Singh besieged the fort, attacking it when some marriage festivities were in progress. Many of the guests were killed and wounded, and the Kanhpurias had to leave the estate for this year. R\u00e1na Beni M\u00e1dho was wounded in this m\u00eal\u00e9e. In 1836, again R\u00e1ja Kundan L\u00e1l, chakladar, had another fight with the taluqdars of N\u00e1in. Again in 1843, five thousand men fought\nround Nain. In 1853, Khan Ali Khan, chakladar, and the Nain gentlemen fought again. In 1857, at the commencement of the mutiny, the Nain taluqdars joined the rebel soldiery, and plundered the station of Parshadepur:\n\n| Population | ... | ... | 811 Hindus. |\n| Ditto | ... | ... | 16 Mussalmans. |\n\nThe fort was formerly a strong place; it is in the middle of ravines, covered with brushwood, which extend to the bank of the Sai, here a narrow deep channel, with lofty banks, picturesquely clothed with jungle. This is celebrated for being the haunt of many wild cattle; these animals differ little from ordinary cattle, yet it is almost impossible to keep them alive if caught and put in confinement.\n\nNAKPUR\u2014Pargana SURHARPUR\u2014Tahsil TANDA\u2014District FYZABAD.\u2014This town is on the Tons, 52 miles from Fyzabad. It was founded by one Muhammad Naqi three hundred years ago. The population consists of 1,248 Hindus and 1,569 Musalmans\u2014all Sunnis. There is one mosque. This, as far as population is concerned, is the chief place in the pargana, as it contains 2,672 persons, but in appearance it rather resembles three or four rural villages joined together than a town. It is on the same bank of the river Tons as Jalalpur, and not more than two miles from that place. It is said to have been founded by an early member of the Baragao family, Sayyad Naqi by name, and to be older than Jalalpur, but very little seems to be known of its past history.\n\nNANDORA\u2014Pargana BIHAR\u2014Tahsil KUNDA\u2014District PARTABGARH.\u2014This village was founded by one Raja Nand, on the road from Bihar to Allahabad. It is three miles north of the Ganges, 31 from Bela, two from Bihar. The population is composed of\u2014\n\n| 1,622 Hindas. |\n| 1,240 Moslems. |\n\nThere are eight mosques, and the tomb of one Sanatul-Haq. There is a bazar called Lalganj, at which property to the amount of Rs. 3,00,000 is annually sold.\n\nNANPARA Pargana*\u2014Tahsil NANPARA\u2014District BAHRAICH.\u2014Nanpara pargana is a creation of the English Government; the whole of it under the late rule (with the exception of 63 villages formerly included in Firozabad) having formed a portion of pargana Bahraich. It is well nigh conterminous with the taluqa of the same name; 259 villages out of 314 belonging to that estate. It is bounded on the north by the Naipal territory, on the east by pargana Charda, on the south by Bahraich, and on the west by Dharmapuri and the Gogra. Its extreme length is 38 miles; its extreme breadth 24 miles; its area being 523 square miles.\n\n* By Mr. H. S. Boye, C.S., Assistant Commissioner.\nThe eastern portion lies high, and forms a part of that table-land which acts as the watershed of the two river systems of the R\u00e1pti and the Gogra. The western half of the pargana is a portion of the basin of the latter river and its affluent the Sarju, which joins the main river just below Khairigh\u00e1t, and has been channelled in all directions by these streams in their wanderings over the country. This section is peculiarly fertile, having a rich yet light alluvial soil which requires no irrigation, and but little labour to induce it to yield very fine crops. The pargana is not so well wooded as its neighbours to the south; only 1\u00b771 per cent. being grove land. The proximity of the jungle tracts, however, in some degree compensates it for this drawback. There is an immense area of culturable waste land, there being 213 square miles of it to 257 square miles of cultivation out of a total area of 523 square miles. Irrigation there is none, except in the higher lying villages to the east. Here, as in the Bahraich pargana, there is every facility for irrigation, the water being near the surface.\n\nThe following shows the areas of land under the main staples of the pargana:\n\n|                      | Acres |\n|----------------------|-------|\n| Wheat                | 2,706 |\n| Barley               | 19,044|\n| Wheat and barley mixed | 5,751 |\n| Sugarcane            | 69    |\n| Arhar and labra      | 2,444 |\n\n|                      | Acres |\n|----------------------|-------|\n| Indian-corn          | 10,408|\n| Rice                 | 18,777|\n| Rape seed            | 5,970 |\n| Other grains         | 78,464|\n\nThe revenue demand is distributed as follows:\n\n| Class of village     | Number of villages | Area in square miles | Government demand | Incidence of Government demand per acre |\n|----------------------|--------------------|----------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------|\n|                      |                    |                      | On cultivation    | On total assessable area               |\n| Taluqdari            |                    |                      | Rs. a. p.         | Rs. a. p.                              |\n| Perpetual settlement.| 8                  | 10                   | 2,280             | 0 0 0 8 3 0 6 3 0 5 6                 |\n| 30 years ditto       | 290                | 489                  | 1,90,920          | 0 0 1 4 1 0 11 11 0 10 11              |\n| 10 years ditto       | 8                  | 27                   | 3,970             | 0 0 0 11 5 0 6 5 0 8 10                |\n| Total                | 306                | 476                  | 1,97,170          | 0 0 1 3 5 0 11 7 0 10 4                |\n| Independent villages | 3\u00bd                 | 3                     | 1,569             | 2 5 1 6 1 0 14 5 0 13 3                |\n| Revenue-free for lifetime only | \u00bc | 1 | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |\n| Grand Total          | 311                | 480                  | 1,98,739          | 2 5 1 8 6 0 11 7 0 10 5                |\nThe following statement gives the population:\n\n| Agricultural | Non-agricultural |\n|--------------|------------------|\n| Brahmins     | 5,618            |\n| Chhetris     | 2,971            |\n| Vaidya       | 4,331            |\n| Kayasth      | 1,406            |\n| Total        | 1,34,100         |\n\n| Agricultural | Non-agricultural |\n|--------------|------------------|\n| Ahir         | 17,560           |\n| Bhanjwa      | 2,930            |\n| Pasi         | 4,514            |\n| Tell         | 3,855            |\n| Chamars      | 10,683           |\n| Karmi        | 16,897           |\n| Kahar        | 6,983            |\n| Kalwar       | 2,754            |\n| Kori         | 5,978            |\n| Garasia      | 2,439            |\n| Nao          | 2,708            |\n| Lodh         | 3,169            |\n| Lohia        | 3,344            |\n| Murao        | 3,061            |\n| Others       | 24,645           |\n| Total        | 1,48,572         |\n\nNumber of souls per square mile, exclusive of Oondh Forest area.\n\nThe large number of Musalmans, of whom the Pathans form the greater portion, are mostly residents of Nanpura itself, and are the retainers of the former taluqdars.\n\nThe main road from Bahrach to Naipalganj passes through Nanpura, and second-class district lines run from Nanpura to Motipur, 16 miles, to Bhinga 29, and to Khairighat 12 miles. The main bazaars are at Nanpura and Khairighat; a great quantity of grain being shipped at this last-named place for exportation. Timber also is floated down from here. Large fairs are held at Jangli Nath, seven miles to the south, and at Takighat, Shah Sujan's Dargah, on the Sarju; at the latter place in November, and at Jangli Nath several times during the course of the year.

As early as the reign of Bahlol Lodi\u2014viz., 891 Hijri (A.D. 1474)\u2014one R\u00e1ja Sangr\u00e1m S\u00e1h, a hill chieftain, is found paying nominally a revenue of Rs. 54,921 for pargana Rajhat, which lies between N\u00e1np\u00e1ra and the hills, but it may safely be assumed that the entry of this payment was a mere boast, and that Sangr\u00e1m S\u00e1h was independent, for Todar Mal is more honest and admits that his imperial master only held sway over 4,064 bigh\u00e1s of cultivated land in Rajhat.\n\nThere is a tradition that shortly before Akbar\u2019s reign\u2014viz., in 1500 A.D.\u2014the whole of this part of the country had the misfortune to be cursed by a saintly mendicant by name Shah Sujan, who had his dwelling at D\u00fag\u00e1on, a town on the banks of the Sarju. The ban was effectual, the city was deserted by its inhabitants in one day, and the country side was overrun by the Banj\u00e1ras. It is certain, however, that this did not happen until after the time of Akbar; for in Abul Fazl\u2019s record the town is spoken of as being a flourishing place, the centre of a considerable trade with the hill tribes; and in the Ar\u00e1ish-i-mahfil, under the name of Deokhan or Deokan, it is described in similar terms, mention being made also of a mint of pice which was established here. The town was evidently one of some importance, the ruins of the houses which still exist proving the very substantial character of the buildings. The Banj\u00e1ras in the reign of Shah Jah\u00e1n became so troublesome that Salona Begam, the wife of Prince D\u00e1ra, was unable to obtain possession of a j\u00e1gir of 148 villages, which, under the name of Salonabad pargana, had been granted to her by her husband\u2019s imperial father. It was then, in 1632 A.D., that one Ras\u00fal Khan, Afgh\u00e1n, Togh, received a commission from the emperor to coerce the Banj\u00e1ras, obtaining a grant of five villages and one-tenth of the rental of the whole of this disturbed tract of country. This ris\u00e1ld\u00e1r is the ancestor (seventh in ascent) of the present R\u00e1ja of N\u00e1np\u00e1ra, whose family gradually secured a firm hold of the large estate now owned by him. In 1662 A.D., the R\u00e1ja of Sali\u00e1na, a fort situated within the hills, held the pargana of Rajhat, and also a portion of pargana Sujauli on the west, but he was apparently unable to penetrate further south, though he was supported by other hill chieftains on the east of Salonabad. In 1784 A.D., the condition of this part of the country is illustrated by a clearing lease that was given to Bhayya Himmat Singh, of Pi\u00e1gpur, by \u00c1sif-ud-daula, from which it appears that out of 1,734 villages in the north of Bahraich 1,486 were completely deserted, while the N\u00e1np\u00e1ra estate only comprised 59 villages. Subsequently the N\u00e1np\u00e1ra r\u00e1ja pushed further northwards, and occupied 105 villages of pargana Rajhat; the R\u00e1ja Kans\u00far S\u00e1h of Sali\u00e1na being driven back until his Tar\u00e1i territory was limited to 173 villages. This remaining tract of country was, after the successes achieved by General Ochterlony, annexed by the British, and made over to the Oudh Government in 1816 A.D.; Kans\u00far S\u00e1h being killed in 1822 A.D. by the Chau-h\u00e1n R\u00e1ja of Tulsipur, to whom this portion of the conquered territory was\nassigned. The next thirty years seem to have been a period of progress. The jungles gradually disappeared, and the taluqdars being men of a strong hand were able to hold their own against the avaricious chakladars (native collectors). For the 16 years, however, prior to annexation, the internecine quarrels of the two r\u00e1n\u00eds, widows of Munawwar Ali Khan, inflicted injuries on the estate from which it is but just recovering. The wide expanse of waste, however, is now gradually coming under the plough, and the pargana is entering on a period of prosperity which it will be difficult even for the present bad management entirely to avert. The estates of the Tulsipur Taluqdar were confiscated for rebellion, and conferred on the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja of Balr\u00e1mpur, but the Government subsequently made over all the villages of what was formerly pargana Rajhat, except a few held by the r\u00e1ja of N\u00e1np\u00e1ra, to the Naip\u00e1l sovereign, from whom they had been wrested in 1816 A.D., and the Balr\u00e1mpur Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja received the Charda and K\u00e1kardari estates in lieu of his first assignment.\n\nN\u00c1NPARA\u2014Pargana* N\u00c1NPARA\u2014Tahsil N\u00c1NPARA\u2014District BAHR\u00c1ICH (Latitude 27\u00b051'20\" north, longitude 81\u00b032'23\" east)\u2014Lies 22 miles to the north of Bahr\u00e1ich on the road to Naip\u00e1lganj, the well known iron mart of Naip\u00e1l. It is about 520 feet above the sea level, and is situated about one mile from the edge of the high ground which forms the watershed of the Sarju and the R\u00e1pti. It is the headquarters of a tahsil and the R\u00e1ja of N\u00e1np\u00e1ra, who owns the larger portion of the pargana of the same name; has his residence here. Tradition says that the town was founded by an oil-man named Nidhai, whence the name Nidhaipurwa, corrupted into N\u00e1dp\u00e1ra, and latterly to N\u00e1np\u00e1ra. In 1047 Hijri (A.D. 1630), one Ras\u00fal Khan, the ancestor of the present r\u00e1ja, obtained it and four other villages in service grant. Ahirs are said to have been the prevailing caste of this part in old times; the Musalmans, however, have lately increased in numbers. The population numbers 6,818, of whom 3,808 are Musalmans. There are 1,267 houses, of which 12 are of brick. Five Hindu temples, four mosques and idg\u00e1hs, a school house, a tahsil and police station, a sar\u00e1\u00e9, and the r\u00e1ja's houses, are the only buildings which call for notice. The vernacular town school is maintained by Government. The police force stationed here consists of one chief constable, three head constables, one mounted constable, and 18 constables.

A fair increasing yearly in importance is held during the Dasahra festival at Jangl\u00ed N\u00e1th on the old bank of the river, 8 miles to the south, and another in November at Tak\u00edagh\u00e1t, 5 miles to the north-west, main roads go from N\u00e1np\u00e1ra to Bahraich and Naip\u00e1lganj, and there are second-class district lines to Mot\u00edpur (via Saragh\u00e1t) 16 miles, to Kat\u00e1igh\u00e1t on the Kauri\u00e1la via Shiupur, Bar\u00fahi, and Khairigh\u00e1t, and to Bhinga via Bhangha, 30 miles.\n\nNASIRABAD\u2014Pargana Rokha J\u00e1is\u2014Tahsil Salon\u2014District Rae Bareli.\u2014This town lies in latitude 26\u00b015' north, longitude 81\u00b034' east, and is situated forty miles west of Sultanpur, four miles south-east of J\u00e1is, and fourteen miles north-east of Salon. This town is partly built on a rising ground which covers the ruins of an ancient fort. The water of the wells is sweet. No forests are near the place. There is a Government school here in which Urdu and Hindi are taught. There is neither sar\u00e1\u00e9 nor baz\u00e1r here. It has only a few shops from which articles of daily consumption are supplied. The annual sales amount to Rs. 20,787. The population amounts to 3,420. And the number of houses is 875, of which as many as 162 are brick-built. Sayyad Dild\u00e1r Ali, the Mujtahid (high priest) of the Shia Musalmans, was a native of this town. He settled at Lucknow, and was appointed mujtahid in the reign of Sa\u00e1dat Ali Khan. Sayyad Muhammed, the mujtahid, who died in 1868 was his son. Maulvi Khw\u00e1ja Ahmad of this town, belonging to the Sunni sect, has a good many disciples. R\u00e1ja Har Parsh\u00e1d, K\u00e1yath, a native of this town, was the N\u00e1zim or Commissioner of Khairabad Division during the reign of the ex-king. He joined the mutineers and went up to Naip\u00e1l where he is said to have died.\n\nIn 1867 A.D., during the Muharram, a fight took place between the Sunnis and Shias, but no lives were lost. The town is said to have been named after Nas\u00edr-ud-d\u00edn Hum\u00e1sy\u00fan, of Delhi, who founded it on the site of four villages. He also built a masonry fort here. But there are two more stories relating to the origin of the name; the one ascribes it to Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Sharqi, who is alleged to have built the fort in the name of his son, Nas\u00edr-ud-d\u00edn, and the other to Sayyad Zikr\u00eda, who transmigrated from J\u00e1is to this place, and is said to have founded the town in the name of his grandfather, Nas\u00edr-ud-d\u00edn. The descendants of Zikr\u00eda are still in possession of the place, and thus give some clue to the latter story. The Musalmans reached this place not before they occupied J\u00e1is. The Hindus, however, seem to have come to this place at a time anterior to theirs, though the exact dates are unknown. The K\u00e1yaths of Nas\u00edrabad are descendants of R\u00e1e H\u00edra Mal, who, on the overthrow of the Ujjain r\u00e1j, came to M\u00fangi P\u00e1tan, and thence accompanied the Bais chief, R\u00e1e Ahban, who invaded Oudh along with the forces of Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn Ghori. R\u00e1e Bh\u00edkham R\u00e1e, son of S\u00e1nbhar Mal, came here as paymaster-general.\n\nNAWABGANJ Pargana\u2014Tahsil Nawabganj\u2014District Bara Banki.\u2014This pargana is bounded on the north by Ramnagar and Fatehpur, on the east by Daryabad, on the west by Dewa, and on the south by Partabganj.\nIts area is seventy-nine square miles, or 50,479 acres, of which 32,266 acres are cultivated, 11,276 culturable, and 5,592 barren. The irrigated area amounts to 9,691 acres, and the unirrigated to 22,575. The river Kaly\u00e1ni skirts the pargana on the north, and flows for about eight miles within its limits. There are about twelve villages on its banks. Water is met with at from six to twelve feet. The principal manufactures are sugar and cotton cloth. Nawabganj town has a considerable market. The metalled road from Lucknow to Fyzabad passes through this pargana; also a road leading to Bahramghat, the great timber market. The railway traverses it, and it also contains the village of Bara Banki, in which is the civil station. The district post and registry offices, the head dispensary, the police stations, and the Government high school, are all at Nawabganj. There are two other village schools. The Government revenue amounts to Rs. 87,441; and the seventy-seven villages of this pargana are held as follows:\n\n| Taluqdari | Mufrad |\n|-----------|--------|\n|           |        |\n\nThe population is returned as 62,832, being at the rate of 795 per square mile. The only villages having a populations of over 2,000 are Nawabganj and Masoli.\n\nThe pargana has been known as such since the Nawabi. Out of the forty-four taluqdari villages twenty-five are held by R\u00e1ja Farzand Ali Khan, of Jah\u00e1ng\u00edrabad, the rest are divided between several neighbouring landowners.\n\nNAWABGANJ\u2014Pargana NAWABGANJ\u2014Tahsil NAWABGANJ\u2014District BARA BANKI.\u2014Nawabganj, the headquarters of the tahsil and pargana of the same name, lies in latitude 26\u00b0 55' north, longitude 81\u00b0 15' east, at a distance of seventeen miles east of Lucknow, 61 west of Fyzabad, and 22 south of Bahramghat. The civil station is situated at Bara Banki, a mile west of the town on some high ground sloping down to the Jamuriha\u2014a small stream flowing between the two. The ground in its immediate neighbourhood is very barren, and cut up by a net work of ravines. The Deputy Commissioner's kachshri, the offices of the assistant engineer, and the assistant opium officer, the jail, police lines, and a few bungalows constitute the station. The imperial road to Fyzabad after crossing the Jamuriha passes close by the town. The main street is broad and the houses on either side well built. A country house was built here by Nawab Shuj\u00e1-ud-daula some 100 years ago on the land taken from two villages, Ras\u00falpur and Faiz-ulla-ganj. The land was made nazul and the town founded by \u00c1sif-ud-daula, but it was never of importance until Bara Banki became the headquarters of the district. The well-to-do Hindus are chiefly Bani\u00e1ns and Sar\u00e9waks (if the latter can be called Hindus), who carry on a large trade in sugar and cotton. The public buildings are the th\u00e1na, Government school, three sar\u00e1es, and a very commodious dispensary. The drainage is good, water plentiful, and climate remarkably healthy. The Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway passes about half a mile to the north of the town, and the railway station, at which there is a junction, with the branch line to Bahramghat, is about a mile to the west of it.\nThere is a temple to Debi, and a shiwal\u00e1 of N\u00e1geshwar N\u00e1th Mah\u00e1deo. The people attend on Mondays and Fridays at these temples, and the fairs of Chait and Ph\u00e1gun, in honour of both respectively are attended by a great assemblage. The total population is 10,606, of which Hindus are 7,411, and Muhammadans 3,195.\n\nThe battle of Nawabganj, in 1857, may be related from Ballis' History of the Mutiny.\n\n\"At length it was considered proper to put an end to operations that produced so much needless anxiety; and at midnight, on the 12th of June, Sir Hope Grant, with a column of all arms, amounting to 5,000 men, marched for Chinhut on his way to beat up the quarters of a division of the enemy, reported to be commanded by the Maulvi.\n\n\"The night was dark, but the guides were skilful, and the force, without accident, reached Jaadrigunge, near Nawabgunge, where it was to cross the Beti Nuddee. Here the advance guard was challenged by a picket of the enemy, and the column halted. At daylight it again moved forward, and crossed the bridge under a fire of musketry and guns, so placed in adjacent topees as to sweep the line of advance. The enemy's fire was well directed, but fortunately the river bank was sufficiently elevated to cover the bridge and the approach to it, and as soon as the artillery had got up and opened fire, the rebels began to retire to their main body (about 16,000 strong), a short distance in the rear of a tope and ravine.\n\n\"The troops followed, and in a short time found themselves surrounded\u2014a heavy ill-directed fire opening upon them from the brushwood in their front, their rear, and both flanks. Encouraged by the success of the manoeuvre by which the European troops had been as it were drawn into a trap, the rebels ventured to emerge from the wood, and bringing their guns into the plain commenced an assault; but Grant's artillery, only 200 yards distant, opened upon them with such a destructive shower of grape as inflicted a fearful slaughter in their ranks, and deterred them from any further effort to attack.\n\n\"While yet hesitating, two squadrons of cavalry and one of Hodson's horse charged, with the infantry, and cut down about 500 of them, and the remainder of the insurgent force, finding themselves beaten on all points, retired precipitately on Nawabgunge, where they remained till the following day, when they were driven out with considerable loss by the English troops, leaving also a great portion of their baggage behind them. At noon on the 14th, Sir H. Grant occupied Nawabgunge, which he at once proceeded to fortify. The rebels, who had retired to Bittowlee, at the confluence of the rivers Ghagra and Chauka, lost no time in throwing up strong earthworks for their protection at that place. The loss sustained by them in the action of the 13th amounted in killed and wounded to 1,000 men, with nine guns and two standards; that on the British side amounted to thirty-six killed and sixty-two wounded.\"\n\nNAWABGANJ Parganat\u2014Tahsil BEGAMGANJ\u2014District GONDA.\u2014This pargana is bounded on the north by parganas Mahadewa and Manikapur, on the south by theriver Gogra and some villages of the Fyzabad district.\non the west by parganas Digsar and Mahadewa, and on the east by the district of Basti. The former area was 90,040 acres; but since settlement the pargana has received an addition, raising its present area to 91,080 acres or 143 square miles, divided into 128 demarcated mauzas or townships. The area of the pargana is divided as follows:\n\n| Unculturable waste | Cultivable ditto | Cultivated | Groves |\n|--------------------|------------------|------------|--------|\n| ...                | 19,979 acres     | 28,484     | 41,274 |\n| ...                | or 21\\(\\frac{1}{8}\\) per cent. | \" 31\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\" | \" 45\\(\\frac{3}{8}\\)\" |\n|                    |                  |            | 1,343  |\n|                    |                  |            | \" 1\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\)\" |\n|                    |                  |            |        |\n|                    |                  |            | 91,080 |\n\n6,039 acres are irrigated from wells, 4,469 acres from tanks, and 30,766 acres are left to natural irrigation. In other words, 28 per cent. of the actual cultivation is irrigated, and 72 per cent. is left unirrigated.\n\nThe Gogra borders the pargana on the south. The smaller streams are the Tirhi, the Jamni, and the Sujoj. These rivers are of no use for irrigation purposes, and occasionally do mischief by overflowing their banks during the rains. There are about 12 villages of this pargana which border the Gogra, and about 15 which lie near the Tirhi. The Jamni skirts 12 villages, and the Sujoj 2. All these are liable to injury from floods. Water is met with at from 14 to 21 feet below the surface. There is no disease peculiar to the pargana. The villages near the jungle suffer much from fever during the cold weather.\n\nThe revenue demand amounts to Rs. 68,307-5-0, land revenue Rs. 66,530, and cesses Rs. 1,777-5-0. The varieties of tenure are:\n\n| Taluqdar\u00ed | Zamindari | Pattidar\u00ed | Total |\n|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------|\n| ...       | ...       | ...       | 272*  |\n\n| Demarcated mauzas | Cupercentary mah\u00e1lis |\n|-------------------|----------------------|\n| ...               | ...                  |\n| 128               | 144                  |\n\nThe tribal distribution of property is as follows:\n\n| Brahman | Chhattari | Musalman | Kayath | Bairagi | Europeans | Nanak shahi | Others |\n|---------|-----------|----------|--------|---------|-----------|-------------|--------|\n| ...     | ...       | ...      | ...    | ...     | ...       | ...         | ...    |\n| 110     | 82        | 27       | 26     | 17      | 7         | 2           | 1      |\n\nTotal 272\n\nThe taluqdar\u00ed villages are mostly held by P\u00e1nde Krishan Datt R\u00e1m, of Singha Chanda, and the Basantpur and Birwa taluqdar\u00eds.\n\nThe population of the pargana is given in the census at 57,439. These reside in 10,345 houses, of which 35 are masonry. The number of the prevailing castes is as follows:\n\n| Brahman | Ahir | Kah\u00e1r | Chhattari | Bani\u00e1n | Mur\u00f3o |\n|---------|------|-------|-----------|--------|-------|\n| ...     | ...  | ...   | ...       | ...    | ...   |\n| 10,079  | 9,011| 4,478 | 4,198     | 2,079  | 1,901 |\nThe traffic is carried on via the metalled road from Gonda to Fyzabad which crosses the Gogra at Miran Gh\u00e1t just above Fyzabad city. A bridge of boats is kept during a great part of the year, but is removed during the rains, and communication is kept up by ferries. It is but seldom, and that only during the rainy season, that boats are seen in the Tirhi. The town of Nawabganj has a considerable grain mart; in it are the post and registry offices; schools have been established at the following places:\n\n| Place                        | Number of pupils |\n|------------------------------|------------------|\n| Tulsipur                     | 53               |\n| Anbholi                      | 48               |\n| Bhanoharpur                  | 32               |\n| Kalyapur                     | 57               |\n| Female school at Kalyapur    | 20               |\n| Another female school        | 20               |\n| Hargobindpur female school   | 20               |\n| Town school, Nawabganj       | 110              |\n| Ramnagar                     | 25               |\n\n**History.**\u2014This pargana was formerly known as Raj R\u00e1mgarh Gauri, and was in the possession of a chief of the Sarawak or Jain religion. These sectaries worshipped the sun, and also a god named Sobh N\u00e1th. Their dominions extended to the hills on the north, to the south the Gogra was the boundary, and on the east were the mountains of Butwal.\n\nWhen Suhel Deo came to the throne, Sayyad Masa\u00fad led his crescent-tade to Oudh, and having fought with him was killed at Bahraich. R\u00e1ja Suhel Deo met his destruction by his fort having been turned topsy-turvy, and the whole of his family crushed to death. His kingdom remained for some time without a lord, till in 1141 A.D. the Muhammadans conquered India, and the Emperor of Delhi bestowed this raja upon Ugarsen Dom as j\u00e1gir. He built several forts in these parts, and fixed his abode near Gorakhpur on the bank of the R\u00e1pti. That place is still called Domangarh. In 1376 A.D., the Dom R\u00e1ja became very powerful, he demanded the hand of a Brahman girl of mauza Karghand, pargana Amo-dha, district Basti, and on his request being refused confined the family to their house. The girl then on the pretence of a pilgrimage to Ajodhya, went to R\u00e1e Jagat Singh, K\u00e1yath, subahdar of Sultanpur, and implored his aid. The subahdar, on the day the marriage was to take place, crossed the Gogra, reached the place with a large force, and cut down all the raja's family and retainers. The P\u00e1nde, father of the girl, then came out rejoicing, and in gratitude for his having saved the Brahman religion, he took off his sacred cord, and threw it on the neck of the valiant subahdar. His descendants are all invested with the sacred cord, and, though K\u00e1yaths, are known by the surname of P\u00e1nde. These K\u00e1yaths abstain from all alcoholic drinks.\n\nThe subahdar after this adventure reported the matter to the Delhi Dar-b\u00e1r, and in consequence was granted the raja of Amodha, and of all this\npart of the country. R\u0101e Jagat Singh then parcelled out the country, and gave portions of it in reward to his followers. There was one Newal S\u0101h, a Bandhalgoti Chhattri, who held the office of ris\u0101ld\u0101r in the R\u0101e\u2019s force, and had shown his bravery in subduing the fort of R\u0101manpur, in the possession of R\u0101ma Bhar, a lieutenant of the Dom R\u0101ja. This officer was a native of Amethi, in the district of Sultanpur; he received the part of country which is now known by the name of the Nawabganj pargana as his share of the booty.\n\nPargana families.\u2014Mah\u0101r\u0101ni Subh\u0101o Kunwar.\u2014This taluqdar is the widow of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Sir M\u0101n Singh, K.C.S.I., and \u201cQ\u0101im Jang,\u201d of Sh\u0101hganj.\n\nRaj\u0101 Krishan Datt R\u0101m, P\u0101nde, of Singha Chanda.\u2014Hann\u016bn R\u0101m P\u0101nde was the progenitor of the line.

His estates lie in seven districts of Oudh. His total land revenue paid to Government amounts to Rs. 81,096-13-8.\n\nAntiquities.\u2014Of the antiquities there is only the B\u0101gh-i-Harharpur, built by Nawab Shuj\u0101-ud-daula in 1184 A.D.\n\nThere are 30 religious places of both creeds, as follows:\n\n| Hindu places of worship | ... | ... | 26 |\n|-------------------------|-----|-----|----|\n| Muhammadan mosques, &c. | ... | ... | 4 |\n\nThe only religious fair is held on the day of R\u0101mnaumi in Chait (March), on the opposite bank of the river, where the fair of Ajodhya assembles. The gathering amounts to more than 50,000. Common articles of daily use are sold. People who come to this fair are those who don\u2019t wish to go across the Gogra to Ajodhya. The gathering disperses as soon as the bathing ceremonies are over.\n\nNAWABGANJ*\u2014Pargana NAWABGANJ\u2014Tahsil BEGAMGANJ\u2014District GONDA.\u2014Latitude 26\u00b052\u2019 north, longitude 82\u00b011\u2019 east. A century ago the present teeming parganas of Nawabganj and Mahadewa were but thinly populated, and Nawab Shuj\u0101-ud-daula, in his frequent hunting expeditions from Fyzabad to Waz\u012brganj, found it necessary to establish a bazar on the north of the Gogra for the supply of his troops and attendants. A site was selected about two miles from the river, just far enough\n\n* By Mr. W. C. Benett, C. S., Assistant Commissioner.\nto be tolerably safe from the rain floods, on the boundary of the villages of Agampur and Tathia; and, from the small beginning thus made, has grown the largest grain market in the district, and perhaps in the whole of Oudh. During the interval of English rule (1802-1816 A.D.), two new quarters were added to the infant bazar, but up to annexation it was never of sufficient importance to be the seat of a government official, and it is since the mutiny that the ten new quarters of Golaganj, Pakka Darwaza, Chai Tola, Lonia Tola, Teliangi Tola, Puria Ram Sahai, Pura Koriaina, Julaha Tola, Thatherai Tola, and Bazzaz Tola, have sprung up round the old muhals of Nawabganj, Motiganj, and Sanichari bazar. The present town contains 6,131 inhabitants and 1,273 mud-built houses. The religion of the people is reflected in the distribution of their places of worship, of which 22 are dedicated to Mahadeo, while three are mosques. It contains one small and very dirty sarai for the accommodation of travellers; and a school, attended by 106 boys, contends without any striking success against the indifference of the local traders to any learning beyond the art of writing their unintelligible business characters. In plan it is a long street, with shops and dwelling-houses on each side, in front of which are piled heaps of grain to attract the attention of dealers. To the north the street broadens on to a good-sized plain, which is bordered here and there by substantial sheds for the storage of merchandize, and serves as a standing place for the innumerable carts, which bring down the produce of the Tarai. The principal export is the rice of Tulsiapur, Utraula, and the north-west portions of the Basti district, and during the end of the cold weather the infamous road from Utraula, which forms the only channel for this trade, is blocked by strings of carts, often numbering over a hundred in a single line.\n\nBesides rice the Tarai contributes large quantities of oil seeds, and the more southern parts of the district their wheat, Indian-corn, and autumn rice. A considerable export business is done in hides, but there is no other article of merchandize of any importance, and the imports are quite insignificant, being confined entirely to salt, and a few thousand rupees worth of English cloth, and pots and pans from Mirzapur or Bhagwantnagar. The trade on leaving Nawabganj takes two main directions\u2014one by the Gogra to Dinapore, Patna, and Lower Bengal, the other through Fyzabad to Cawnpore, and the cotton country. The main export by the latter is rice, while Bengal absorbs the greatest part of the oil seeds, Indian-corn, and hides. Of such part of the trade which passes through other districts before leaving the province, there are absolutely no means of making at all an accurate estimate: nor do I attach any great value to the returns of the registration office for the merchandize which leaves the province at once. It is obviously for the interest of the natives stationed there to leave as many carts out of their tables as possible, and pocket the fees themselves, and effective supervision is impossible. Anyhow the returns, if absolutely accurate, could only give an inadequate idea of the trade actually carried on, as there is nothing to confine carts to this one halting place, and numbers of them dispose of their merchandize at small bazars, a few miles to the east\u2014in Shahganj, Ismailpur, and other stations\u2014along the river, where they are free from Government toll, Government police protec-\ntion, and Government regulation cleanliness. An abstract of the returns is given for what it is worth. As far as I can tell their audacious mendacity puts them beyond the pale of criticism. For instance, that only 360 hides left the market for Lower Bengal in 1871-72 is wholly incredible, as it is hardly possible to visit the place for a single day without seeing a far larger number collected there. The fact that these returns only cover the direct trade with Lower Bengal is here of no consequence, as that province takes all the hides exported from Gonda.\n\nTill two years ago octroi was levied on every article sold in the bazar, and a light ad valorem duty provided from the traders' pockets, the cost of repairing roads, which is now paid in addition to his land revenue by the proprietor of the soil. When this was abolished a small fixed toll on each cart and beast of burden was substituted; and the register shows that in 1870-71 A.D., the market was visited by 36,500 carts and 9,100 beasts of burden, while the numbers in 1871-72 were 42,344 and 26,680 respectively. Assuming, as will be near the truth, that a fourth of the carts were drawn by four bullocks, and allowing twenty maunds for a four-bullock, ten for a two-bullock cart, and four maunds to each beast of burden, we get the following results. Total exports in 1870-71, 4,81,400 maunds, total in 1871-72, 6,50,160 maunds.\n\nThe mart is connected by a good metalled road with Gonda (24 miles), a good grass road runs through Par\u00e1spur to Colonelganj (35 miles), while Utraula is divided from it by an almost impassable embanked way, which in a length of thirty-six miles opposes at least as many formidable obstacles in the shape of broken bridge arches, or severed banks, to the toiling cart bullocks.\n\nExport returns via the Gogra from Nawabganj bazar.\n\n| Wheat | Value | Rice | Value | Oil-seeds | Value | Other edible | Value | Hides | Value | Total exports | Value |\n|-------|-------|------|-------|-----------|-------|--------------|-------|-------|-------|---------------|-------|\n| 1867-68 | 163,173 | 2,46,077 | 53,333 | 69,644 | 290,806 | 4,64,967 | 284,996 | 2,03,908 | 14,380 | 7,159 | 780,908 | 8,04,688 |\n| 1868-69 | 166,241 | 2,66,945 | 443 | 1,105 | 783,567 | 199,171 | 810,581 | 1,186,892 | 10,510 | 5,990 | 1,325,273 | 84,74,854 |\n| 1869-70 | 3,902 | 8,495 | 271 | 550 | 622,800 | 118,163 | 71,745 | 1,19,835 | 88,330 | 84,838 | 548,960 | 13,80,509 |\n| 1870-71 | 46,512 | 46,400 | 225 | 539 | 92,638 | 1,09,518 | 16,198 | 17,079 | ... | ... | 155,963 | 1,63,634 |\n| 1871-72 | 18,646 | 21,474 | 1,185 | 1,480 | 56,297 | 1,47,748 | 38,213 | 38,693 | 960 | 400 | 101,133 | 2,05,635 |\n\nNAWABGANJ\u2014Pargana JHALOTAR AJGAIN\u2014Tahsil Moh\u00e1n\u2014District Unao.\u2014Lies 12 miles north-east of the sadr on the metalled road to Lucknow, from which place it is 25 miles distant. A th\u00e1na, a tahsil, and school were all established at this place, but all have been removed. There is a large fair in the end of Chait every year in honour of the Durga and Kusahri Devis. The temple of the former goddess lies in Nawabganj, and that of the latter in village Kusumbhi, where there is also a pick-up station of the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway, Cawnpore Branch. This fair attracts a very large gathering from Lucknow and Cawnpore, besides the people of the neighbourhood.\n\nThis ganj was built by Am\u00edn-ud-daula, the prime minister of Oudh in 1249 fasi (1842 A.D.), with a sar\u00e1e and mosque. There is also a tank built\nby Naubat R\u00e1e, treasurer. Though the removal of the tahsil from it, and\nthe introduction of the railway to Cawnpore, caused material damage to\nthe local trade, as it was a d\u00e1k station, and most traffic since then passes\nby railway, the annual sales still amount to Rs. 18,000; a great part of\ncourse being made up by the bargains made in the fair. The population\nis 3,128, of which 547 are Musalman.\n\nNEOTINI\u2014Pargana Moh\u00e1n Aur\u00e1s\u2014Tahsil Moh\u00e1n\u2014District Unao.\u2014\nNeotini is a Muhammadan town, situated south-west of Moh\u00e1n about two\nmiles off on the right bank of the river Sai. It is the seat of the only\nMuhammadan colony that seems to have come into the pargana. But\nthe arrival of the Musalmans was early, and they took possession of nine\nvillages, which they hold to the present day. The town is said to have\nbeen founded by a Dikhit, R\u00e1ja R\u00e1m, a descendant of R\u00e1ja Balbhadr of\nJhalotar, who on a hunting expedition saw the spot, and attracted by its\nbeauty cut away some of the thin grass that grew there, and founded a\ntown which he called Neotini. There is an old d\u00e1k in the place still as-\nsigned as the site of his fort. It remained with the Dikhits till the time\nof R\u00e1ja Apre, who having, it is said, ill-treated and plundered a great mer-\nchant, whose complaints reached the ears of Mahm\u00fad of Ghazni, was\ndriven out by an invasion headed by M\u00edr\u00e1n Muhamad and Zah\u00edr-ud-d\u00edn\n\u201cAft\u00e1b.\u201d They and their descendants have occupied the place ever since.\nThey said it was Khuda D\u00e1d which gives the date 614 A.H. (1197A.D.),\nso it must have been occupied in the reign of Shams-ud-d\u00edn. The place\nbears an air of prosperity. There are several old mosques and shrines and\nsome good houses belonging to members of the family, who hold appoint-\nments under the British Government, and are pleaders in the courts. The\nland round the town is extraordinarily rich and well cultivated; the crops\nbeing poppy, vegetables, spices, and medical herbs. The p\u00e1n gardens are\nvery numerous; the families of tamol\u00eds number no less than 37. The\nwhole population is 3,809, and the number of houses 718. There is a\nGovernment school in this place. There is only a small bazar.\n\nNEWALGANJ-cum-MAHR\u00c1JGANJ\u2014Pargana Moh\u00e1n Aur\u00e1s\u2014Tah-\nsil Moh\u00e1n\u2014District Unao.\u2014(Latitude 26\u00b048' north, longitude 80\u00b0\n43' east.) This is a junction of two market towns situated on the road\nto Moh\u00e1n from Lucknow, about 13 miles from the city. It is two miles\neast of the tahsil station Moh\u00e1n, and 26 south-east of the sadr (Unso.)\nThe former was built by Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja Newal R\u00e1e, the N\u00e1ib of Nawab\nSafdarjang, and the same who built the bridge over the Sai at Moh\u00e1n; the\nlatter is a continuation of it built by Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja B\u00e1lkrishn, the late finance\nminister of the ex-king. It is approached by a long and handsome bridge\nwhich terminates in an archway, the entrance into the bazar. The ganj\nis about one-fourth of a mile long, and ends in another archway, passing\nunder which, a sharp turn to the right brings the traveller opposite a third\narch, which is the entrance into Newalganj. The bi-weekly bazar is held\nin Mahr\u00e1jganj, and is one of the largest in the neighbourhood. The total\nannual sales amount to Rs. 25,000, and consist of all the usual country\nproduce of grain, tobacco, spices, and vegetables, with country cloth and\nEuropean piece-goods. There is also a separate trade in brass vessels.\nwhich are made in large quantities in Newalganj, where a large colony of Thatheras (braziers) has established itself. The climate of the place is healthy, water good, and scenery tolerable. The remains of an enclosure built of solid masonry round the town and its gateway are historical features.\n\nThe Machberia gate contains the Government school. There is also an old sar\u0101e; it boasts of three temples to Mah\u0101deo and eight mosques. A fair is annually held on the day of Dasahra, the 10th of the lunar half of Jeth (May-June), having an attendance of not more than 500 people.\n\nAt the west end of Newalganj is the police station where a force of 12 policemen is kept up, who have the whole of the pargana to look after. The station is not very centrally placed. The total number of inhabitants is 3,728, and the houses 725, but none are of masonry. The inhabitants are chiefly Hindus, and largely made up of braziers, Bani\u0101ns, and Brahmans. There are of these classes 77,129, and 91 families respectively. The rest consist of food and vegetable-dealers, Bhurjis (grain-parchers), Halwais (confectioners), Ahirs (herdsmen), Telis (oil-men), and Cham\u0101rs (tanners). The population amounts to 4,028; Hindus being 3,618, and Musalmans 310. The place is a thriving centre of trade.\n\nNIGH\u0100SAN Pargana*\u2014Tahsil NIGH\u0100SAN\u2014District KHERI.\u2014Pargana Nigh\u0101san has been quite recently constituted. It consists of the Trans-Chauka portion of the old pargana of Bh\u016br; like that pargana it somewhat resembles a wedge in shape, lying from west to east, with the narrow end at the west, and the broad end at the east. On the north lies pargana Khairigarh, which is separated from Nigh\u0101san by the river Suheli or Sarju, which flows from west to east with a very winding course of about 45 miles from Dudhua Gh\u0101t, where it enters the pargana to Shit\u0101bi Gh\u0101t, where it flows into the river Kauri\u0101la. The length of Nigh\u0101san, however, is only on the northern side 35 miles from east to west. On the south lies pargana Bh\u016br, which is separated from Nigh\u0101san by the river Chauka, which has a tolerably straight course of about 30 miles. The length of Nigh\u0101san on the southern side from east to west is 26 miles. On the west side Nigh\u0101san touches Palia, which till recently belonged to the district of Shahjahanpur in the North-West Provinces. A straight line eight miles in length going due north and south from the Sarju to the Chauka, and marked by masonry pillars, denotes the boundary between the two parganas, which was also for about 53 years the boundary between British India and the kingdom of Oudh. On the east Nigh\u0101san marches with pargana Dhaurahra, and is 14 miles in breadth from the Chauka at Pachper\u012b Gh\u0101t to the Sarju; at Shit\u0101bi Gh\u0101t there is no natural boundary, and the line of demarcation is irregular, and about 18 miles in length.\n\nThis pargana forms a part of the low plains lying between the great rivers and the mountains which are called the G\u0101njar. It nearly all lies in the tar\u0101i of the rivers Chauka and Sarju; there is some high land\n\n* By Mr. J. C. Williams, C.S.\nbetween them; the pargana possesses certain geographical features which may be now described.\n\nThe Sarju is a narrow stream of an average width of 50 yards; the depth of water at the fords is only a few feet, and the fords are numerous; the current is slower than that of the Chauka; the banks are generally about 20 feet high, both on the north and south side, or even higher; sometimes they follow close along the edge of the river, and sometimes reach to a distance of a mile or two miles from it, leaving a low tarai along the river side. Innumerable small tributary streams flow down into the Sarju from the higher land to the south, but many of these are backwaters through which the autumnal floods often escape out of the Sarju and inundate the tarai; occasionally but seldom rising to the level of the higher lands.\n\nThis tarai is generally covered with a jungle of khair, shisham, and gular trees, and is subject to inundation during the autumnal rains. After the reconquest of Oudh a large portion of this jungle was appropriated by Government, and was afterwards made over to the Forest Department; for the first 28 miles of the river's course, after entering the pargana at Dudhua Gh\u00e1t, the jungles along its banks belong to the Forest Department; for the next 17 miles they belong to revenue-paying villages.\n\nThe course of the Sarju is so winding that its distance from the Chauka and consequently the width of the pargana varies from 4 to 14 miles. Between the two rivers there exists a long high ridge of land, with a good loamy soil, forming a central plain varying in width from one to nine miles, the greatest width being at the east. This plain can only be called high by comparison with the lower lands along the rivers to the north and south. There is probably no part of it where water is not found 14 feet below the surface; and the soil is so moist that except vegetables, poppy, and tobacco no crops need irrigation. It is intersected by \"sotas\" or backwaters of the Sarju and Chauka, which frequently communicate with each other; and it is covered with jhils of the curious formation called \"bhagghar,\" which have been already described under the head of pargana Bh\u00far.\n\nOne of these sotas is called the Bahatia; it has a wide bed, and in the autumn carries a large volume of water; it crosses the pargana in the centre, flowing at right angles to the Sarju and Chauka from north to south, or from south to north, according as the floods from the Sarju or that from the Chauka be the stronger. The bhagghars assume the most fantastic shapes, but always retain the one characteristic attribute\u2014a very high bank on one side and a low marsh on the other.\n\nIn addition to the bhagghars and sotas, large shallow jhils are scattered over the whole surface of the central plain, while dry water-courses and ravines intersect it in every direction, running into the jhils, sotas, and bhagghars at every imaginable angle.\n\nIn the higher parts of the central plain the soil consists of a very thin loam, mixed with much gritty earth and very small stones. This soil\nshines like sand, and generally has a substratum of pure sand at a distance of from a few inches to a few feet below the surface. It is poor and unproductive, and known by the local name of *t\u0101pa*.\n\nIn my report of pargana Bh\u016br, I said that I believed the whole country between the high bank in that pargana and the corresponding high banks in Khairigarh formed once a large inland lake.*\n\nThe general appearance of the country, its interminable network of lakes and streams, dry water courses, and gritty high land, and specially the alternate ridges and depressions of soil by which the high land gradually slopes down into the river tar\u0101is\u2014all seem so many evidences of a time when the whole country was part of a great inland lake. The absence of *\u015b\u0101kha* trees, which only grow in soils beyond the influence of fluvial action, may be mentioned as another argument; they grow in abundance to the south of the high bank in Bh\u016br, or north of the high bank in Khairigarh, but hardly anywhere between the two rivers.\n\nThough the period when the country was a lake has long ago passed from the memories and traditions of the people, the fact that the river Chauka or S\u0101rda and the river Sarju were once the same stream is still fresh in their minds. These rivers are known to have been once connected quite recently by a water-course now almost dry which passes near Newalkh\u0101r, and when they were thus connected, the waters passing down the stream flowing under Khairigarh, now called the Sarju, were called the Chauka, and far exceeded in volume those contained in the most southern channel of the Chauka. Now the case is exactly the reverse, and the name Chauka is restricted to the southern stream. I have mentioned that the two rivers are even now connected by the Baita river which flows across this pargana.\n\nAn argument that the rivers were once the same may be derived from the etymology of the words. Sarju is of course a mere euphonious contraction of S\u0101rda koj\u016b; the river of S\u0101rda, and *as j\u016b* is Persian, the name must have been given first in Muhammadan times. This reduces the three names to two. Now S\u0101rda is the title of a goddess, and is assumed both by Saraswati, wife of Barmha, and by Durga, wife of Shiva. The mythology of the Brahmins, which assigns divine protectors to mountains, rivers, and all great natural features, necessarily provided a goddess for a stream mightier even than the Ganges; probably the goddess was originally Saraswati, but she receives now but scanty honour. The Chauka is now looked on by the residents on its banks as under the peculiar protection of Durga. It is frequently called Mah\u0101r\u0101ni or Chauka Mah\u0101r\u0101ni; sometimes S\u0101rda, or S\u0101rda Mah\u0101r\u0101ni. These two names therefore are evidently the names of one river and of its tutelary goddess. The word Chauka\n\n---\n\n* An argument in support of this conclusion may be drawn from the etymology of the word *t\u0101pa*. For it is evidently the same as *t\u0101p\u0101*, which in Hindi means an island, and I think the conclusion is possible that the patches of high land which have the soil now called *t\u0101pa* were originally islands in the middle of the large lake or inland sea which once stretched from the Sarju to the Chauka; being the highest land, they are of course the parts of the plain which would first be left dry by the receding waters.\nis I understand derived from a Sanskrit word meaning cleanliness, purity. The Hindus even now believe that its waters possess peculiar efficacy both for ordinary cleansing purposes and for ceremonial ablutions. Some go so far as to maintain that its waters yield not even to those of mother Ganga: Chauka therefore means the pure river, Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ni Chauka, the Queen of purity.\n\nOn the south of the central plateau is a low plain forming the tar\u00e1i of the river Chauka, and generally resembling the low plain already described in pargana Bh\u00far. It is completely inundated for several months of every year. The floods reach it by simply overflowing the river bank, and not as in Bh\u00far and Srinagar by first flowing up backwaters communicating with the stream, and generally joining it at almost a right angle. In Nigh\u00e1san the bank of the Chauka is seldom more than 5 feet in height, but the northern bank of the river Gh\u00e1ghi, which is now to be described, is on an average quite 20 feet in height during the eastern part of its course.\n\nThere are hardly any backwaters or sotas running out of the Chauka. Their place is taken by a branch of the Chauka called the Gh\u00e1ghi. The Gh\u00e1ghi leaves the Chauka between the Gh\u00e1ts of Marauncha and Patw\u00e1ra in pargana Palia, and flows in a direction nearly parallel to that of the Chauka to a spot some three miles north of Pachperi Gh\u00e1t only 22 miles to the south-east. The Gh\u00e1ghi draws the high country in the centre of the pargana, and a great number of jh\u00edls and streams run into it.\n\nThe course of the river has so many windings that it is some 32 miles in length. Its average distance from the Chauka is from one to four miles, and it may be considered as the boundary between the central plain and the Chauka tar\u00e1i.\n\nThe Gh\u00e1ghi joins the Chauka at Chhedoipatia for about a quarter of a mile and then again leaves it. From this spot it has increased in volume of water greatly within the last few years, and it now flows with a deep and rapid current between high and steep banks, but in a very narrow bed, about 15 yards in width. Year by year the volume of its waters is increasing, and there appears a probability that the Chauka may soon altogether leave its present bed and pass off into that of the Gh\u00e1ghi.\n\nThis will be a mere repetition of the process that we have seen has been at work in pargana Bh\u00far for many ages, where apparently every change of the river's course brought it further to the north.\n\nIf this happens, as the present bed of the Gh\u00e1ghi will be far too small to contain the whole stream of the Chauka, the waters will sweep over the country bordering on the Gh\u00e1ghi, and spread ruin far and wide over some of the finest villages in this pargana.\n\nThe change of the Chauka's course opposite Bh\u00farguda has been mentioned in my Bh\u00far report. Abandoning its old bed it has cut through Maurias Loki and Munria Mah\u00e1deo, leaving Dhundhila and the jungle grant No. 12 on its south; and joining the Gh\u00e1ghi it re-enters its old bed three miles above Pachperi gh\u00e1t in company with that stream. From the spot where the Gh\u00e1ghi rejoins the Chauka, the latter has a high bank.\non its northern side, somewhat similar to the high ridge which meets the river on its southern side just above Bh\u00farguda, about two miles west of junction of the two rivers. At annexation several villages of this pargana were found to be deserted, some lay on the Palia frontier, forming a considerable tract of country, to a great extent overgrown with jungles, several others lay along the banks of the Chauka, these villages had all formed part of the great Bh\u00far taluqa, and appear to have fallen out of cultivation, and become abandoned by their inhabitants in the time of R\u00e1ja Ganga Singh, or at any rate within 30 years of annexation.\n\nAt the reconquest of Oudh these villages were appropriated by Government, and were soon repeopled by immigrants from Khairigarh, Dhaurahra, Bahaich, and Sh\u00e1jah\u00e1npur. After being held for sometime on lease by the taluqdar of Patihan, they have lately been decreed to Government, the north-west corner of the pargana,\u2014in fact the whole of the forest Chak is still very scantily inhabited.\n\nThe forests along the Sarju river swarm with wild animals, and herds of wild pigs, deer, blue bulls, and antelopes wander about undisturbed, and find abundant pasture and water; they do great injury to the crops in the villages alongside the forest; and great labour and trouble have to be devoted to the necessary task of watching the fields by night. Tigers are occasionally but seldom found to the south of the Sarju; panther and leopards are more frequently met with.\n\nThe inhabitants of the villages in the forest chak suffer terribly from goitre, which occasionally reaches the stage where it becomes cretinism, and from jungle fevers, generated by the decaying vegetation in the malarious swamps within the forest.\n\nThese villages are mostly small and thinly peopled, but they all have very large areas of fallow, waste, and forest land within their boundaries. Tilokpur and Maj\u00f3n are the only considerable villages in this portion of the pargana. The former gives its name to the taluqa held for some years by Sarabj\u00edt S\u00e1h, Taluqdar of Patihan, and now decreed to Government.\n\nOn the south also, in the G\u00e1njar chak, there are no large villages except one Munra Munri which has the remains of an old fort. Here every village has a number of small hamlets scattered over its lands, and situated on rising ground just out of reach of the floods; generally this part of the pargana is exactly like the G\u00e1njar plain of pargana Bh\u00far.\n\nThere are some large, fine, and populous villages in the central chak, of these Lodhauri was formerly one of the headquarters of the Bh\u00far taluqa; Nigh\u00e1san has a police station, a tahsil station, and a large bazar, and gives its name to the pargana. Rakheti and Parua have some fine masonry mosques and temples, and are surrounded with magnificent mango groves.\n\nThere is a road running through the pargana from Palia on the west to Shit\u00e1bi Gh\u00e1t on the east frontier, being a part of the high road from Bahaich to Sh\u00e1jah\u00e1npur; and at Bahr\u00e1mpur, near the centre of the par-\ngana, it is crossed at right angles by a road from Sirsi Gh\u00e1t, on the south to Khairigarh on the north. There are no other roads.\n\nThe gh\u00e1ts or ferries on the Chauka are at Margha, Sirsi, or L\u00e1lhojhu and Pachperi, a hamlet in Munra, and have been mentioned in the Bh\u00far report. On the Sarju there are fords at Dudhua, Khairigarh, Dukherwa, and Shit\u00e1bi, where the Sarju and Kauri\u00e1la meet. The area and population of the whole pargana is here given\u2014\n\n| Number of villages | Cultivated area without fallow | Cultarable area including fallow | Barren and revenue-free |\n|--------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------|\n|                    |                               |                                 |                        |\n| 78                 | 66,184                        | 64,894                          | 16,045                 |\n\nTotal 1,47,160\n\nPopulation 54,683\n\nPopulation per square mile 239\n\nThe one grant which has now been partly cultivated, and is held by R\u00e1o Tula R\u00e1m, lies on the river Chauka. It has an area of 3,252 acres, and a population of 159 persons. This grant belonged at first to a Eurasian, Mr. Taylor, but was sold in execution of a decree of the civil court, and purchased by its present owner.\n\nThe seven tracts of forest along the river Sarju have an area of 15,971 acres. In these forests there are a few huts here and there inhabited by herdsmen tending cattle, and boatmen taking logs of timber down the Sarju river, but the population is fleeting and inconsiderable, has never been enumerated, and is not known. For the whole pargana then the figures are as follows:\n\n| Total area | Population | Population per square mile |\n|------------|------------|---------------------------|\n| 146,160    | 54,683     | 239                       |\n| 3,252      | 159        | 33                        |\n| 15,971     | Not known. | Not known.                |\n| **165,383**| **54,842** | **212**                   |\n\nBut as the forest will never be brought under cultivation, the forest area is to the settlement officer the same as barren land, and is excluded from all calculations about the relation of population to the cultivated and culturable areas. For purposes of assessment, the population per square mile is not 212 but 239.\n\nThere are no data for giving exact details of the number of the various castes, as the pargana has been newly constituted since the census tables were compiled. Approximately I estimate them as follows:\n\n| Muhammadans | Brahmins | Chhattris |\n|-------------|----------|-----------|\n| 2,900       | 3,800    | 1,400     |\nThere has been a considerable immigration of Mur\u00e1os and Lodhs since the reconquest of Oudh. There is only one proprietary caste throughout the whole pargana, the Chauh\u00e1n Rajput family of the Bh\u00far taluqa. The old pargana of Bh\u00far was conterminous with the boundaries of the Bh\u00far taluqa. Proprietary rights in the pargana are thus distributed:\n\n| Name of taluqdar. | No. of villages. | Remarks. |\n|-------------------|-----------------|----------|\n| Joint estate of the R\u00e1ni of R\u00e1j Ganga Singh, R\u00e1j Gubardhan Singh, R\u00e1j Gum\u00e1n Singh, and R\u00e1j Dal\u00edpat Singh... | ... | 49 |\n| R\u00e1j Gum\u00e1n Singh... | ... | 1 |\n| R\u00e1j L\u00e1lta Singh, a relative of the family... | ... | 1 Rent-free for life. |\n| R\u00e1j Mil\u00e1p Singh, ditto ditto... | ... | 1 |\n| R\u00e1j Dal\u00edpat Singh... ditto ditto... | ... | 6 |\n| R\u00e1ni R\u00e1j Ganga Singh ditto ditto... | ... | 4 |\n| Mahura D\u00e1s Gosha\u00edn... | ... | 1 Rent-free for ever. |\n| Government... | ... | 10 |\n\nThe eleven villages which do not now belong to this family did so once, the Gosha\u00edn's village was given to him by a former taluqdar, and the ten villages now belonging to Government were appropriated at annexation as waste land; because they had become deserted by their inhabitants, and entirely fallen out of cultivation; they are called the Tilokpur taluqa from the name of the principal village.\n\nIn a description of this pargana, the Mur\u00e1os from their number and prosperity claim special notice. Like almost all of the agricultural and artizan castes, the Mur\u00e1os claim to have seven subdivisions, and these subdivisions are bound down by very strict rules regulating what they may and what they may not cultivate. The name of the subdivision that ranks first is, as in the case of many other castes, Knaujia. The other six tribes are Thak\u00faria, Kachhw\u00e1ha, Haridw\u00e1ra, M\u00e1nwa, Jaisw\u00e1r, and Kori.\nMur\u00e1os are enterprising and bold men, and are always ready to emigrate from their homes and settle in new lands, specially if they are offered easy tenures, and find soil suitable to their peculiar crop, \"Ubi bene est, patria est,\" should be the Mur\u00e1os motto. Mur\u00e1os cultivate all the common cereals that are grown by other castes, and a Mur\u00e1o's field may generally be known by the closeness of the furrows to each other, and the smallness of the clods into which the plough has broken up the soil. Of crops almost exclusively grown by this caste turmeric is the principal. This crop is grown only by the Thakurias and Haridw\u00e1ras, and since annexation there has been a considerable immigration of these men into the northern villages of Bh\u00far, who are bringing large areas of lands under turmeric cultivation.\n\nThe Kanaujias are the sub-caste that abound all over pargana Nigh\u00e1san, and they have been up to the present time increasing in number by immigration every year. They are not allowed by the rules of their caste to grow turmeric; their peculiar crops are vegetables and poppy and tobacco; they also grow onions and garlic, in great quantities, and here all castes eat garlic, and all except Brahmans eat onions. Recently the district authorities have been directed to aid the Opium Department in stimulating the cultivation of the poppy, and within the last year the plant has spread very greatly all over this pargana. Besides turmeric, onions, garlic, tobacco, and poppy, the following articles are occasionally grown by the Mur\u00e1os of this pargana:\n\n- Coriander (dh\u00e1nia).\n- Pepper (mirch).\n- Parsain (luniya).\n- Fenugreek (methi).\n- Aniseed (ajwain).\n- Marshmallows (khatm\u00ed).\n- Ginger (sonth).\n- Endive (k\u00e1ni).\n- Anise (saunf).\n\nThe fear of destruction by wild animals prevents Mur\u00e1os from growing these plants in the h\u00e1r, and they are all grown quite close to the village; whereas in England a farmer never will sow his most valuable crops, such as turnips and carrots, anywhere except at some distance from a village or town from fear of being robbed by them at night.\n\nIt speaks well for the morality of the peasantry that the market gardener can rear his valuable produce unprotected by wall or fence, and, surrounded by the dwellings of a dense population, without the slightest fear or risk of being robbed.\n\nIn the settlement report of the Bh\u00far pargana I have described G\u00e1njar scenery, but when closing my description of pargana Nigh\u00e1san, I cannot refrain from making a few remarks on the description of the people of G\u00e1njar country recently written by the Extra Assistant Commissioner, K\u00e1l\u00ed Sah\u00e1e. He states that the customs and manners, the dress, the food, and the language of the G\u00e1njar people are all totally different from those of the people in the upper country,\u2014in fact, he seems almost to consider the inhabitants of the G\u00e1njar as a separate nation.\n\nThese statements are, I think, somewhat exaggerated and likely to mislead. There are some differences, but they seem to me to be only such as\nare naturally attributable to the backwardness and remoteness of the country. There is no great highway of commerce through it or near it, and large forests and enormous rivers are formidable barriers to the progress of civilization. The usual characteristics of a rustic population are found in an exaggerated form. This is the principal point of difference between the G\u00e1njar and the upper country.\n\nThe simplicity and ignorance of the people is certainly greater than in any other part of Oudh. I have been in villages where a European had never before been seen; where on several occasions the th\u00e9k\u00e1d\u00e1rs came forward to offer me their nazaras (presents) of three or four rupees, and showed great surprise when they were refused. In fact, once a lengthy explanation and apology on my part became necessary to remove from an old gentleman's mind the impression, that the refusal of the nazar was a direct insult, or at least a signal mark of the H\u00e1kim's displeasure.\n\nThere is no difference in the language, but the pronunciation is peculiar; the vowels are broadened and softened, and some of the inflections in the conjugation of the verb are different from anything I have heard before. These differences are sufficient to cause some difficulty in understanding the people. But there is great ignorance of the most ordinary Urdu or Persian words, which sometimes lead to puzzling and amusing errors. I recollect two villages, Girda Kal\u00e1n and Girda Khurd. None of the inhabitants know the meaning of the distinguishing epithets. They had always called their villages Bar\u00e1 Girda and Chhota Girda, and now considered that two new names\u2014Kal\u00e1n and Khurd\u2014had been bestowed on them by the Government. They were loth to give up the old names, yet hesitated to disobey a supposed order, so they had compromised the matter by naming their villages Bar\u00e1 Girda Kal\u00e1n and Chhota Girda Khurd. An old instance of a new application of a familiar term, and also of the rapidity with which historical facts are forgotten, is the name given to pargana Palia by the inhabitants of the Oudh pargana bordering it. It is always known as the Angrezi Maur\u00fasi, the hereditary dominion of the English.\n\nIn dress I have found no difference except in the case of one caste, the Banj\u00e1ras, whose women wear petticoats and jackets made of different coloured patches of cloth, and having no sleeves for the arms, which are bare of clothes, but generally almost covered with silver ornaments. But Banj\u00e1ra women dress thus wherever they may be settled.\n\nCustoms and manners differ only so far as they are agricultural, and are modified by the peculiar circumstances under which husbandry is in this country carried on.\n\nIn the matter of food there is some difference,\u2014for instance rice, jundhri, and barley are almost the only grains eaten by the people, specially the first of the three; wheaten bread is an unheard of luxury, only the cheaper kinds of rice are eaten, and the better kinds are exported.\n\nThe differences in social customs, if they exist, are certainly not apparent to a European. But the remoteness and backwardness of the country is a constant theme of merriment to native visitors from the upper country and the contempt with which an inhabitant of Kheri pargana, or of any place south of the Ul, regards the people of the G\u00e1njar, and their country\nis most amusing to a European; the southerner looks on the people of the G\u00e1njar as rustic boors, and on their country as an outlandish jungle, and parties and witnesses in court constantly apologize for their inability to speak intelligibly, or their ignorance of the simplest rule of procedure, by begging the presiding officer to remember that they are simple people living in the G\u00e1njar.\n\nThe aversion with which the low river plains are regarded is most advantageous to the inhabitants, though they do not know it. But it keeps out population, and therefore keeps down competition for land. Immigrants from the upper country have to be tempted to settle by the most liberal offers. The nakshi tenure is probably more favourable to the cultivator than any other in India.\n\nConsequently the people as yet are very well off, and it is gratifying to see their prosperity, and the independence that must accompany it, shared by low castes as well as by high. The evidences of it stare one in the face. Little children, with golden ear-rings and bracelets, meet me in every village, and the wives of even Cham\u00e1rs and Pit\u00e1s load themselves with silver ornaments. The same is the case in Khairigarh.\n\nThe independence and prosperity of the lower castes tends to weaken the feelings by which caste distinctions are supported. Brahmans, Chhatris, and Gosains are not ashamed here to plough with their hands; whereas in Baisw\u00e1r\u00e1 the high caste man is degraded by the touch of the plough. In the densely inhabited villages of Baisw\u00e1r\u00e1, and districts in the south of Oudh, the females of the lowest castes are not allowed to wear any jewellery whatever, and generally would be too poor to possess any.\n\nThe low castes keep great herds of swine, and pigs attain a size and fatness that would win them honourable mention even in Baker street. Dogs abound in G\u00e1njar villages, testifying by their independent bearing and loud and bold barkings that they too share in the general prosperity. Banj\u00e1ras specially have a fine large breed of dogs which they use for the chase of wild animals, principally boars, of the flesh of which this caste is immoderately fond. Gar\u00e9rias also keep dogs in great numbers for watching their flocks of sheep and goats.\n\nTable showing the population of the pargana.\nNIGOH\u00c1N SISSAINDI Pargana*\u2014Tahsil MOHANLALGANJ\u2014District LUCKNOW.\u2014The pargana of Nigoh\u00e1n Sissaindi lies between latitude 26\u00b030' and 26\u00b050', and is crossed by 81\u00b0 of longitude. It is one of the two parganas into which the tahsil of Mohanlalganj is divided. Its area is seventy-two square miles. In shape it is oblong, with a length of from twelve to thirteen miles, and an average breadth of five. The Mohanlalganj pargana lies on its north, and it is bounded on the south by the river Sai, which separates it from the district of Unao.\n\nIt is traversed by two roads\u2014one running from Rae Bareli along the north side of the pargana through Mohanlalganj to Lucknow, and the other from Sissaindi, lying at its south-west corner to Mohanlalganj.\n\nThe pargana is finely wooded to the south and round the town of Nigo- h\u00e1n, but to the north-west it is bare, and crossed by large barren plains. The country along the Sai is light and sandy, and also along the banks of the Bank stream, which crosses the pargana obliquely from the north, and joins the Sai at a point to the south of Nigoh\u00e1n. This sandy land amounts to twenty per cent. of the cultivation, and very much affects the fertility of the pargana. Except round the large villages, and in the south-west of the pargana, the cultivation is not so high as in the other parganas of the district.\n\nThe Sai is the only river, and is little fitted for irrigation, which is carried on chiefly from small jhils and wells. The only large jhils are at Sissaindi\u2014where the water is almost unfailing\u2014and Jabrauli. The cultivation round the former village is specially fine. Water throughout the pargana can be met with at a distance of thirteen feet from the surface, and well-irrigation is more than ordinarily common, amounting to thirty-seven per cent. of the whole extent irrigated.\n\nThe old pargana consisted of sixty-four villages, but by demarcation they have been reduced to fifty-seven, averaging an area of 805 acres each.\n\nThe population is in density 517 to the square mile, and Musalmans amount to only 4\u00b76 per cent. of the whole. In this it stands lowest of any of the parganas in the district.\n\nThe agricultural element is fifty-two per cent. This is also below the average, and is perhaps due to the presence of Brahmans; who are more than usually numerous in this pargana.\n\nOf the total area fifty-seven per cent. is cultivated, and the population falls on this at the rate of 1,005 per square mile. The culturable is high, amounting to 34\u00b719 of the whole, but 9,890 or forty-three per cent. of this is under groves. What is left is situated towards the north of the pargana, and being largely mixed with \u00fasar, will not readily be broken up. Probably all that is worth much has been taken in hand.\n\nWith the percentage of agriculturists somewhat less than in other parganas their average holdings are large; they amount to from three and a half to five acres. The rents are very equitable, and, as might be expected\n\n*By Mr. H. H. Butts, Assistant Commissioner.\nfrom the nature of the pargana, low. They vary from Rs. 4 to 5 per acre except for a few Mur\u0101os, who pay Rs. 8-14 per acre.\n\nThe summary revenue was ... ... Rs. 37,330\nThe revised demand is ... ... \" 48,160\n\nThe revenue falls at a rate of Rs. 2-0-0 on the cultivated, Re. 1-5-0 on the cultivated and culturable, and Re. 1-1-0 throughout.\n\nIt falls lower than any other pargana in the district.\n\nThe only two towns, with a population of more than 2,000, are the old pargana centres of Nigoh\u00e1n and Sissaindi. These two towns are separated from each other by a distance of some ten miles, and lie at the east and west ends of the pargana. The former contains 2,306 and the latter 3,104. Besides these there are seven other towns, with a population of over 1,000. They are Bhadew\u00e1n, Bhasanda, Bhandi, Jabrauli, Day\u00e1lpur, Diburia, Sherpur L\u00e1wal.\n\nSchools are established at Nigoh\u00e1n and Sissaindi, at Jabrauli, Diburia, and L\u00e1wal. Its chief bazars are held at Nigoh\u00e1n, Sissaindi, and Day\u00e1lpur. The former, situated on the road to Rae Bareli, is the most important; its annual sales are said to amount to Rs. 17,000.\n\nFor police arrangements the pargana lies within the jurisdiction of the station fixed at the Mohanlanganj t\u0101bsil.\n\nThe two towns of Nigoh\u00e1n and Sissaindi are of importance as being the old headquarters of the two clans of Janw\u0101rs and Gautams, who colonized\u2014the former forty-two and the latter twenty-two villages. It seems that the latter were much the earliest comers, for their traditions connect them with the Bais of Baisw\u0101ra and the kingdom of Kanauj. The former came with or subsequently to the Janw\u0101rs of Mau and Khujauli, at perhaps the end of the sixteenth century, and, it is said, drove out a tribe of Bhars, whose stronghold was on the Kakoha d\u012bh on the village of Siris. The two settlements combined form the modern pargana of Nigoh\u00e1n Sissaindi.\n\nBoth were included in the Baisw\u0101ra jurisdiction, and the Bais of the Naistha house claimed to be lords of the soil. Even at as late a date as 1231 fa\u1e63l\u012b, one of the houses transferred the lordship of the pargana of Sissaindi to R\u0101ja K\u0101shi Parsh\u0101d, of whose estate it forms the chief part, while Th\u0101kur Bhagw\u00e1n Bakhsh, Bais of Kusmaura, successfully occupied and still holds five villages in Nigoh\u00e1n.\n\nBut in the Nigoh\u00e1n pargana, Gautams, inheriting from the Janw\u0101rs, and the Janw\u0101rs of Jabrauli kept the rest, though in the end the latter were dispossessed by the Khattri bankers of Maur\u0101nw\u0101n, who farmed their villages.\n\nBoth the towns that formed the headquarters of these parganas are very old. Sissaindi was founded by Shiu Singh, one of the Gautam leaders. But to Nigoh\u00e1n some mythic history is attached. It is said to have been founded by R\u0101ja N\u0101huk, of the Chandrabansi line of kings. And near the village to the south is a large tank, in which the legend says\nthat the r\u00e1ja, transformed into a snake for cursing a Brahman, was con-\ndemned to live. Here at length the P\u00e1ndu brothers in their wanderings\nafter their battle with the Kurus came; and to each as he reached the\nedge of the tank to draw water were five questions, touching the vanity\nof human wishes, and the advantage of abstraction from the world, put\nby the serpent. Four out of the five brothers failed to find answers, and\nwere drawn under the water, but the riddle was solved by the fifth. The\nspell was thus loosened, the r\u00e1ja's deliverer had come; the P\u00e1ndu placed\nhis ring round the serpent's body and he was restored to his human shape.\nThe r\u00e1ja then performed a great sacrifice, and to this day the cultivators,\ndigging small wells in the dry season in the centre of the tank come\nacross burnt barley and rice and betel nut. Probably the root of the\nword Nigoh\u00e1n, N\u00e1g, exists in this legend, which points to some former\nN\u00e1g worship, and not in the name of N\u00e1huk.\n\nIt seems not unlikely that the settlement of Janw\u00e1rs in Nigoh\u00e1n was\nsubsequent to the time of Akbar, for in the \u00c1\u00edn-i-Akbar\u00ed no such pargana\nis mentioned.\n\nThe tenure is largely taluqdari. The total number of demarcated vil-\nlages is only fifty-seven, and of these thirty-six belong to taluqdars. They\nare divided between three taluqdars\u2014R\u00e1ja Chandra Shekhar of Sissaindi,\nTh\u00e1kur Bhagw\u00e1n Bakhsh of Kusmaura, and L\u00e1la Kanhaiya L\u00e1l of Jab-\nrauli; but the latter taluqdar belongs more properly to Maur\u00e1nw\u00e1n in\nUnao. The remaining villages are pretty equally divided amongst\nthe Hindu caste, but Brahmans and Chhattirs predominate. The\nfollowing account is from the settlement report. R\u00e1ja Kashi Parshad\nhas since died, and has been succeeded by his adopted son, Chander\nShhek\u00e1r.\n\nR\u00e1ja K\u00e1shi Parsh\u00e1d of Nigoh\u00e1n is one of the six loyal taluqdars\nwho, for their adherence, and the assistance they gave to the British\nGovernment during the mutinies, were conspicuously rewarded by grants\nof villages, and a remission of ten per cent. on their revenues.\n\nThe rise of this family is recent, and dates from the marriage of the pre-\nsent taluqdar into the family of P\u00e1thak Amirt L\u00e1l, the chakladar. The\nR\u00e1ja's grandfather was L\u00e1l Man, a Tew\u00e1ri Dam\u00e1n, Brahman of Misr Khera,\nand of one of the most honoured Brahman houses, who only give their\ndaughters in marriage to the Awasthi Parbh\u00e1kar the B\u00e1ppei of H\u00edra,\nand the P\u00e1nde of Khor, Brahman tribes. L\u00e1l Man was a banker of\nhis native town, and rose to be chakladar of Baisw\u00e1ra in 1240 or 1442 fa\u0161li\n(1833 A.D.). In the latter year he was imprisoned as a defaulter, but\nwas released on the security of P\u00e1thak Mohan Lal, son of Amirt L\u00e1l, who\ngave him, moreover, Rs. 10,000, and arranged for the marriage of his grand-\nson, K\u00e1shi Parsh\u00e1d, with one of his the P\u00e1thak's daughters.\n\nK\u00e1shi Parsh\u00e1d is now a great man. He has built himself a fine house\nat Sissaindi, and a handsome temple and ganj in the village of Mau, on the\nroad from Lucknow to Rae Bareli, which he has called Mohanlalganj after\nhis father-in-law, and which now has become the headquarters of the tahsil,\nand gives its name to both the pargana and tahsil. He holds a large il\u00e2qa consisting of the whole of\u2014\n\n(1) The Sissaindi pargana, with the exception of one village.\n\n(2) Of Mau and Dewa, and the estate of Karora in Mohanlal ganj, eleven villages in all.\n\n(3) Of Barauna, &c., twelve villages in pargana Bijnaur.\n\n(4) Of Dadlaha, &c., twenty-five in the district of Unao.\n\nFifty-eight villages in all, assessed at Rs. 54,989.\n\nThe Dadlaha estates he received for his services during the mutiny. The Barauna estates he acquired by sale. Karora he got by a mortgage transfer in 1238 fasli (1831 A.D.), the genuine nature of which transaction however is strenuously denied by the old zamindars. Mau and Dewa were only held on farm. But the Sissaindi estate was acquired through P\u00e2thak Amirt L\u00e2l. The proprietary of this pargana is said to have vested on the chief of the Bais family of Kurar Sidauli, and it was one of the nine parganas that fell to the Naistha house on the partition of the Baisw\u00e2ra principality. In 1231 fasli (1824 A.D.), on the occasion of the investment of Shankar Sah\u00e2e, grandson of Amirt L\u00e2l, with the Brahmanical cord, he induced the R\u00e2ni Basant Kunwar, the widow of R\u00e2ja Dirgp\u00e2l Singh, to confer the pargana on him in shankalp.\n\nP\u00e2thak Amirt L\u00e2l had three sons:\u2014(1) Kundan L\u00e2l, whose son was Shankar Sah\u00e2e, whose cord-investment occasioned the gift. The wife of Shankar Sah\u00e2e still holds her share in the estate, though subordinate to the taluqdar. (2) Sit\u00e2r\u00e2m, whose share R\u00e2ja K\u00e2shi Parsh\u00e2d bought up when he defaulted. (3) And Mohan L\u00e2l, father-in-law of R\u00e2ja K\u00e2shi Parsh\u00e2d. These three all died previous to 1248 fasli (1841 A.D.); and from 1243 fasli to 1259 fasli (1836 to 1852 A.D.), the estate was held either by the widow of Shankar Sah\u00e2e or Mohan L\u00e2l. This is the pedigree:\n\n```\nBakhsh\u00ee R\u00e2m.\n|\nP\u00e2thak Amirt L\u00e2l.\n|\n|     |\nSit\u00e2r\u00e2m. Mohan L\u00e2l. Kundan L\u00e2l.\n|\nA daughter married to R\u00e2ja Shankar Sah\u00e2e.\nK\u00e2shi Parsh\u00e2d.\n```\n\nThe history of Taluqdar Th\u00e1kur Bhagw\u00e1n Bakhsh, of Kusmaura, lies in the Rae Bareli district, and he only possesses in this pargana of Nigoh\u00e2n the small estate of Kusmaura consisting of five villages, which he inherited from his adoptive mother, the widow of Jaw\u00e2hir Singh, Bais.\n\nThe Bais's title is however questionable; there are no records of his holding at all till 31 fasli (1847 A.D.). But it seems that Nigoh\u00e2n was one of the nine parganas of the Baisw\u00e2ra principality that are said to have fallen to the Naistha house on the division of R\u00e2ja Tilok Chand's kingdom.\nThe Bais, however, had no real zamindari here, and the real owners of the soil were Gautams and Janwars, who were regarded and treated as the zamindars on the annexation of the province. But the widow of Jaw\u00e1hir Singh, the Thakur\u00e1in Gul\u00e1b Kunwar, was settled with to their exclusion on its re-occupation in 1858 A.D., and has been succeeded by her adopted son, the present taluqdar, a member of another branch of the family. His estate in this pargana is assessed at Rs. 5,300.\n\nTaluqa of Jabrauli.\u2014The history of L\u00e1la Kanhaiya L\u00e1l, of Jabrauli, better known as the taluqdar of Maur\u00e1nw\u00e1n, lies more properly in the Unao district.\n\nNIGOH\u00c1N\u2014Pargana NIGOH\u00c1N SISSAINDI\u2014Tahsil MOHANLALGANJ\u2014District LUCKNOW.\u2014Nigoh\u00e1n, on the Lucknow and Rae Bareli road at the 23rd milestone from Lucknow, lies a little off the road to the right, and is beautifully surrounded by woods. It was under the native rule, the administrative centre of the pargana known as Nigoh\u00e1n, and was included in the Baisw\u00e1ra division of the province. The name of the town is said to have been derived from R\u00e1ja N\u00e1huk of the S\u00farajbansi line of Ajodhya, but the tradition is mixed up with the mythology of a snake whose body the raja, it is said, was condemned to assume, and which dwelt in a tank to the south of the village. A yearly festival is held to the memory of this snake, and the origin of the name (Nigoh\u00e1n) probably lies in this. It is said to have been one of the centres of Bhar rule, and the Bhars were driven out by Janwars, who migrated here from Ikauna in the Bahraich district. A generation or two after him saw his line ending in a daughter who had been married to L\u00e1ka Singh, Gautam of Kunta Naraicha, royal dynasty, and Nigohan, with a few villages, fell to him, and it has ever since remained in his family. It is probably that the Janwars did not arrive in this part of the country till some time towards the end of the 16th century. They are nearly connected with the Janwars of Mau, who, it is said, were admitted by the Shekhs of Rahmatnagar, of the same family as the Salempur Chandhris, the owners and occupiers of a great part of the adjoining pargana of Mohanlalganj during the reign of Akbar. It was during the reign of this emperor that a pargana was made out of two tappas, 22 Gautam and 24 Janw\u00e1r villages, with Nigoh\u00e1n as its centre. As its history will show the population is very largely Hindu. It was an unimportant division of a revenue circle of the Baisw\u00e1ra division, and was ruled from Haidargarh maintaining here only a tahsildar and q\u00e1numg\u00f3. The population is 2,306 inhabiting 509 houses, and the Brahman element in this is very strong. Their principal means of subsistence are the numerous large groves which surround the village and which have always been held rent-free. The few remaining inhabitants that are not agricultural follow the ordinary village trades. There is a Government vernacular school here, and the sales in the bazar amount to 17,500.\n\nIn the centre of the village is a small shrine on which offerings are made on Sundays and Mondays to the eponymous hero of the place, B\u00e1ba N\u00e1huk, and the Gautams light in his house a daily taper. And in the month of K\u00e1tik there is the annual snake festival at the Abh\u00edniw\u00e1ra tank, the tank where the snake was thrown off (Abh\u00edniw\u00e1ra). On the bank of\nthis jh\u0101l is a picturesque grove of old trees in which is a small brick enclosure dedicated to Mah\u0101deo, to whom offerings are made at this festival, and amongst other observances milk is poured into a small hole in the ground probably to the special honour of the snake. Near the grove is a small hamlet of Ahirs.\n\nNIH\u00c1LGARH CHAK JANGLA\u2014Pargana JAGDISPUR\u2014Tahsil Mus\u00e1firkhana\u2014District Sultanpur.\u2014This village stands 36 miles west of the Sadr Sultanpur on both sides of the Lucknow-Sultanpur road. The village S\u00e1th\u00e1n lies six miles north of this. It was founded 150 years ago by R\u00e1ja Nih\u00e1l Khan, the ancestor of the husband of R\u00e1ni S\u00e1dha B\u00edb\u00ed, taluqdar of Mahona in this district, on the land of the village Chak jangla whence the village derived its name. The mud-built castle, built by R\u00e1ja Nih\u00e1l Khan, was occupied by the tahsildar who resided here up to annexation, but it has been razed since. This village has a police station, and there is also a Government school. There are 562 mud-built houses, and only one brick-built belonging to Balmukand, a banker of the Agarw\u00e1la Bani\u00e1n caste, who has acquired the zamindari right in some villages by mortgage and sale deeds. By the census of 1869, the population amounts to 2,593; of these there are 1,292 males and 1,301 females. There are three small brick-built Hindu temples. The bazar of this town contains some shops of Thatheras (braziers) besides those of the ordinary dealers in articles of food and clothing.\n\nNIMKH\u00c1R or N\u00cdMS\u00c1R*\u2014Pargana MISRIKH\u2014Tahsil MISRIKH\u2014District Sitapur.\u2014This town is 20 miles from Sitapur, and lies on the left bank of the Gumti at the junction of the Khairabad and Sitapur roads in latitude 27\u00b026' north, longitude 80\u00b035' east. A third road connects it with Hardoi, and there is good water communication afforded by the Gumti, which flows down through Lucknow, Sultanpur, and Jaunpur, to the Ganges. It is unbridged here. The town is famous for its sacred tanks, and the traditions connected with them, to treat of which would be out of place here. Suffice it to say that its origin is buried in remote antiquity, and no trace remains of the original founders, who they were or whence they came. The name is derived either from \"nawa saranga,\" the forest of holiness, or from n\u00edmas, which bears locally the meaning of the holder of the discus: because it is said that Brahma flung a discus into the air bidding people to deem holy the place where it fell. It is a poor place with but 2,307 inhabitants, who are mostly Brahmans and their dependents. A bazar is held on Tuesdays and Fridays, the annual sales being but Rs. 18,540 in value.\n\nThe tanks and temples are numerous; of the former those called the Panch Par\u00e1g (containing the water of five holy places), the Chakr T\u00edrath, wherein thousands of people attend to bathe on Somb\u00e1ri Am\u00e1washy\u00e1s, the God\u00e1ori, the K\u00e1shi, the Gangotri, the Gumti, &c., are very famous. The temple of L\u00e1lt\u00e1 Debi has widespread celebrity. There is but one mosque. There are the pakka remains, bricks, and blocks of limestone, of the old Government fort, the residence of an \u00e1mil under the native r\u00e9gime.\n\nBy Mr. M. L. Ferrar, B.A., C.S., Assistant Commissioner.\nHere commences the pilgrimage or paikarma described in the notice of Misrikh, where it is brought to a conclusion. The climate of Nimkh\u00e1r is peculiarly salubrious. Cholera has never been known to appear in it. The camping ground is good, and water is abundant. There are several masonry and 610 mud built houses. The following is from Colonel Sleeman:\n\n\"This place is held sacred from a tradition that Ram after his expedition against Ceylon came here to bathe in a small tank near our present camp, in order to wash away the sin of having killed a Brahmin in the person of Rawun, the monster king of that island, who had taken away his wife (Seeta). Till he had done so, he could not venture to revisit his capital (Ajoodheea).\n\n\"There are many legends regarding the origin of the sanctity of this and the many other places around, which pilgrims must visit to complete the pykurma or holy circuit. The most popular seems to be this. Twenty-eight thousand sages were deputed, with the god Indur at their head, on a mission to present an address to Brimha, as he reposed upon the mountain Kylas, praying that he would vouchsafe to point out to them the place in Hindoostan most worthy to be consecrated to religious worship. He took a discus from the top-knot on his head, and whirling it in the air directed it to proceed in search. After much search it rested at a place near the river Gomtee, which it deemed to be most fitted for the purification of one's faith, and which thenceforth took the name of Neem Sarung\u2014a place of devotion. The twenty-eight thousand sages followed, and were accompanied by Brimha himself, attended by the deotas or subordinate gods.\n\n\"He then summoned to the place no less than three crores and a half or thirty millions and a half of teeruts or angels, who preside each over his special place of religious worship. All settled down at places within ten miles of the central point (Neem Sarung); but their departure does not seem to have impaired the sanctity of the places whence they came. The angels or spirits, who presided over them sent out these offshoots to preside at Neemsar and the consecrated places around it, as trees send off their grafts without impairing their own powers and virtues.\"\n\nNIR*\u2014Pargana Gopamau\u2014Tahsil Hardoi\u2014District Hardoi.\u2014(Population 2,481, chiefly Chamars.) A rich agricultural village, six miles south-east from Hardoi. It was founded by Nir Singh, a Chamar-Gaur in the service of the Hindu kings of Kanauj, who drove the Thatheras out of their stronghold at Besohra, and utterly destroyed it. A ruined mound of brick remains still marks its site.\n\nOEL\u2014Pargana Kheri\u2014Tahsil Lakhimpur\u2014District Kheri.\u2014This large village is situated on the road from Lakhimpur to Sitapur, eight miles west of the former. It lies on a plain of fine clay soil, beautifully cultivated and studded with trees, intermixed with numerous clusters of graceful bamboos. The two villages, Oel and Dhakua, adjoin each other and form a large town, but the dwelling-houses have a wretched appearance, consisting of ruinous mud walls and thatched roofs. There is a handsome\n\n* \"Sleeman's Tour through Oudh,\" Vol. II. pages 4-5.\n\u2020By Mr. A. H. Harrington, C.S., Assistant Commissioner.\ntemple dedicated to Mah\u00e1deo in the centre of the town, and the houses are close upon the ditch of the fort, which has its bamboo fence inside the ditch and mud parapets. This temple was built by Bakht Singh, grandfather of R\u00e1ja Anrudh Singh, the headquarters of whose estate Oel is. There are two other temples, one of which was built by R\u00e1m D\u00edn, n\u00e1ib of the said r\u00e1ja. There are four sugar manufactories, but no market.\n\nPopulation, 3,003\u2014\n\n| Hind\u00fas | ... | ... | 2,648 | Muhammadans | ... | ... | 360 |\n|--------|-----|-----|-------|-------------|-----|-----|-----|\n| Male   | ... | ... | 1,387 | Male        | ... | ... | 182 |\n| Female | ... | ... | 1,256 | Female      | ... | ... | 178 |\n\nPACHHIMR\u00c1TH Pargana*\u2014Tahsil BIYAPUR\u2014District FYZABAD.\u2014It is said that an influential Bhar chief, of the name of R\u00e1thor, founded the village of R\u00e1th, now known as R\u00e1het, to which he gave his own name. Here he had his residence, and made his revenue collections. He is also traditionally believed to have founded another village to the eastward in the direction of Chir\u00e1n Chupra, to which he gave the same name and used in the same way. From that day the one village was known as Pachhim (the western) R\u00e1th, the other P\u00farab (the eastern) R\u00e1th. This is the q\u00e1n\u00fango's account. The more likely tradition as to the name is that mentioned in the account of pargana Haweli Oudh, and which I obtained from Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja M\u00e1n Singh\u2014viz., that at a former period the territory between the rivers Gogra and Gumti was known as Pachhimr\u00e1th and P\u00farabr\u00e1th. From the village of Pachhimr\u00e1th or R\u00e1het the pargana takes its name.\n\nMore than 200 years ago one Bhagan R\u00e1e, Bais, whose family history will be detailed further on, came from Baisw\u00e1ra, and founded the bazar still known as R\u00e1mpur Bhagan. A Government fort was also there built, and the Government revenue was thereafter collected there.\n\nThis tahsil contained the four zila subdivisions of K\u00fal Sar\u00e1on, Achhora, Asth\u00e1na, and Bhadaula. There was also formerly the usual tappa distribution, and the names of these subdivisions are marginally indicated, but they have long been set aside.\n\nThe pargana during native rule consisted of 856 townships, of which 50 were offshoots (d\u00e1khl\u00eds). Under the operations of the demarcation department these villages were reduced to 467 in number. Of these 104 villages have since been transferred to parganas Am-sai and Mangalsi, to give convenient jurisdictions, while 52 other villages have, for the same reason, been added from the jurisdictions marginally noted, so that pargana Pachhimr\u00e1th, as now constituted, contains 415 townships.\n\nMangalsi. Jagdispur. Sultanpur.\nHaweli Oudh. Majhaura.\n\n*By Mr. F. Carnegy, Commissioner.\nThis pargana is bounded on the east by Majhaura, on the west by Rudauli of Bara Banki, on the north by Haweli Oudh, and on the south by Sultanpur Baraunsa, of the Sultanpur district. The pargana is intersected by two unnavigable rivulets, the Madha and the Bisoil. The former stream takes its rise in the village of Basorhi in the Bara Banki district. The latter has its source in the Anjar jhil in pargana Sultanpur of the district of that name. After passing through Pachhimrath these streams unite in the neighbourhood of the town of Majhaura, and from that point the river is known as the Tons, on which stands the station of Azamgarh; the stream is rendered memorable by traditionary associations with R\u00e1m Chandra.\n\nThere are remains of the former Bhar population in about 32 villages of this jurisdiction, the chief of these being those which are marginally mentioned.\n\nThe following details embrace such meagre particulars as have been ascertained regarding the former landed proprietors of the jurisdiction\u2014\n\nChauh\u00e1ns of Ahran.\u2014The family traditions set forth that one R\u00e1e Bh\u00e1n R\u00e1e of this clan, the ancestor of Tahdil Singh and Amar Singh, the present representatives of the family, came with his followers from Mainpuri to bathe at Ajodhya, some 400 years ago, and ended in replacing the Bhars and assuming possession of 565 villages, of which however 125 only were of this pargana, the rest being of Isauli, Sultanpur, and Khanda\u0144ska. R\u00e1e Bh\u00e1n R\u00e1e was succeeded by his two sons, J\u00e1l\u00e9 R\u00e1e and Dunia R\u00e1e, who divided the property equally between them. The estate of the former of these brothers was swallowed up by the Bh\u00e1le Sult\u00e1n tribe, a century and a half ago. The portion of the estate (62 king's mauzas) which pertains to this pargana, and which belonged to the other brother, remained in the proprietary possession of his descendants till annexation; they have since lost the Intg\u00e1on estate under settlement decree. The offspring of R\u00e1e Bh\u00e1n R\u00e1e are still found inhabiting 16 villages, and the revenue they pay under the revised assessment amounts to Rs. 19,721.\n\nThe Bais of Malahtu.\u2014The family traditions have it that some 200 years ago, one Jamuni Bh\u00e1n Singh, of this clan, the ancestor of Kunjal and Bhab\u00fat, the present representatives of the family, came from Mungi P\u00e1tan, in the province of M\u00e1lwa (the locality whence the Bais of Baisw\u00e1ra also trace their advent), and overthrew and dispossessed the Bhars, and increased his estate till it contained 84 villages, including the Kur\u00e1w\u00e1n and P\u00e1ra Malahtu properties of 42 villages in this pargana, and the Johar\u00edmpur property of 42 villages in pargana Sultanpur. The 42 Pachhimrath villages are now included in 10 demarcated villages, and to these the descendants of Jamuni Bh\u00e1n have subproprietary claims; they are residents of five of them.\n\nThe Bais of Sohwal and Bur\u00fa.\u2014Jagat R\u00e1e, of this clan, the ancestor of Subh\u00e1n Singh, Autar Singh, and others, now living, came from Baisw\u00e1ra some 400 years ago, and aided in the suppression of the Bhars. He had\ntwo sons, Rudr S\u00e1h and Mehndi S\u00e1h. The former established the Bar\u00fa estate of 27 villages, the latter the Mehdon\u00e1 estate of a similar number of villages. These properties are now included in the estate of Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja Sir M\u00e1n Singh, and in six of these villages only have the Bais anything resembling a subproprietary position, in some of the others they still cultivate the soil.\n\nThe Bais of Uchh\u00e1pali.\u2014About 300 or 400 years ago, New\u00e1d S\u00e1h, of this tribe, the ancestor of Isri Singh and others, still living, came from Baisw\u00e1ra, and succeeded the Bhars in the management of this estate, which he then increased to 20 mauzas (villages). New\u00e1d S\u00e1h in his lifetime made over eight of these villages to his priest, a Tiw\u00e1ri Brahman. The offspring of New\u00e1d S\u00e1h are still in subordinate possession of the remaining 12 villages.\n\nThe Bais of R\u00e1mpur, Bhagan\u2014Tikri, &c., Moti R\u00e1e, and Chhote R\u00e1e, two brothers of this tribe, the ancestors of Jaskaran Singh, Binda Singh, Sarom\u00e1n Singh, &c., who are still living, came from Baisw\u00e1ra with a f\u00e1rm\u00e1n for 104 villages, and the office of chaudhri, from Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr Shah, and fought the Bhars, replacing them in the possession of mauza Nitw\u00e1ri, Chhatarpur, and 51 other villages of tappa Pars\u00fami, and 52 villages of tappa Pind\u00fa, including R\u00e1mpur Bhagan. The office of Chaudhri of tappa Rahet was also held by the family in the person of the direct ancestor of Jaskaran Singh, but this office they had lost long before annexation.\n\nThis family still holds most of the ancestral property in direct engagement with the State, and it is now represented by 41\u00bd demarcated villages. Five other villages had, however, passed into taluqas before annexation.\n\nThe Bais of Gandor.\u2014One Chhatai Singh, of this tribe, the ancestor of Dunia Singh and Daljit Singh, now living, came from Baisw\u00e1ra 300 years ago, and took service with some Bhar chief. Having afterwards invited his master to partake of his hospitality, he put him to death, and took possession of his estate. Chhatai Singh had three sons, Chand\u00ed R\u00e1e who succeeded to Gandor, and whose descendants in the present generation still hold the parent village in their proprietary possession. They have been named above. Kali\u00e1n R\u00e1e, who founded Kali\u00e1n Bahadarsa, pargana Haweli Oudh, and Barsingh R\u00e1e, who founded mauza Barsingh in the same pargana.\n\nFrom the above details it will be seen that there are no less than five families of Bais alleging a separate and distinct advent and origin in this pargana. There are four similar families in the neighbouring pargana of Mangalsi, and one in Haweli Oudh. I request attention to my note on the Bais of Mangalsi, for the observations there recorded apply equally here. All these Bais are looked down upon and disowned by the Tilok-chandi Bais, and I have no doubt that their ancestors were persons of low origin, who have been admitted within the last few centuries only to a place amongst the Rajput tribes.\n\nTwo taluqas have their centres in this pargana, Khajur\u00e1hat and Meh-dona. Of these I now proceed to give some details.\nThe Bachgotis of Khajur\u00e1hat.\u2014B\u00e1b\u00fa Abhai Datt Singh, the present owner of this taluqa, is the younger brother of B\u00e1b\u00fa Jai Datt Singh of Bhiti; both being offshoots of the Kurw\u00e1r r\u00e1j. An account of the elder of these brothers is given in the Majhaura history, but some further particulars of the family have since been obtained, and these may as well be given here.\n\nAfter the overthrow of Shuj\u00e1-ud-daula at the battle of Buxar, more than 80 years ago, he is known for a time to have abandoned the neighbourhood of Fyzabad, and to have spent some months in the direction of Rohilkhand. Advantage was taken of his absence by, amongst others, Duni\u00e1pat, the then taluqdar of Kurw\u00e1r, to increase his possessions by annexing thereto Khajur\u00e1hat and numerous other estates of parganas Pachhimr\u00e1th and Haweli Oudh, but, on the return of the Nawab, the B\u00e1b\u00fa was again deprived of all these new acquisitions. After the death of Shuj\u00e1-ud-daula, and in the days when his widow, the Bah\u00fa Begam, held this part of the country as j\u00e1g\u00edr, B\u00e1b\u00fa Bari\u00e1r Singh, a younger brother of Duni\u00e1pat, again succeeded in acquiring a property in these parganas, which paid an annual demand of Rs. 80,000 to the State, and of this estate he retained possession till 1232 fasli. In the following year, owing to the B\u00e1b\u00fa's default, the then N\u00e1zim Val\u00e1yat Ali deprived him of his entire property. In 1234 fasli, the n\u00e1zim returned to the B\u00e1b\u00fa the Khajur\u00e1hat portion of the property, consisting of 26 villages, held on an annual rent of Rs. 6,000, but of which sum Rs. 4,700 was remitted on account of the taluqdar's n\u00e1nk\u00e1r. The rest of the estate was settled village by village with the zamindars, with whom the n\u00e1zim entered into direct engagement. This state of things ran on till 1243 fasli, when the then N\u00e1zim, Mirza Abdulla Beg, made the Bhiti and Khajur\u00e1hat properties, consisting of the entire estate that B\u00e1b\u00fa Bari\u00e1r Singh and his predecessor had accumulated, over to the chief of the rival clan of the neighbourhood, B\u00e1b\u00fa Harp\u00e1l Singh Garagbansi, the ancestor of the taluqdar of Khapr\u00e1dih. B\u00e1b\u00fa Bari\u00e1r Singh then fled to the British territories where he soon afterwards died.\n\nIn 1245 fasli, R\u00e1ja Darshan Singh became n\u00e1zim, and during his rule the sons of Bari\u00e1r Singh, B\u00e1b\u00fas Jai Datt Singh and Abhai Datt Singh, were restored to the Bhiti and Khajur\u00e1hat estates, which moreover were considerably added to. The two brothers divided the family property in 1259 fasli, the elder receiving the Bhiti estate, estimated at one and a half share, and the younger Khajur\u00e1hat, of one share. The former of these now consists of 81 villages paying Rs. 37,850-10-0 per annum to the State, the latter of 54\u00bd villages paying Rs. 21,472. These brothers are highly respected, and I look upon them as amongst the best of our smaller taluqdaris.\n\nThe Sangald\u00edpi Brahmans of Mehdona.\u2014According to the family records, Sad\u00e1sukh P\u00e1thak was a Sangald\u00edpi Brahman of note in Bhojpur, who held the office of chaudhri. In the general confusion that followed the overthrow of Shuj\u00e1-ud-daula by the English in that quarter, Gop\u00e1lram, the son of Sad\u00e1sukh P\u00e1thak, left his home, and finally settled in the village of Nandnagar Chori, pargana Amorha, zillah Basti, about the\nend of the last century. Purandar R\u00e1m P\u00e1thak, son of Gop\u00e1l R\u00e1m, subsequently crossed the river, and married into the family of Sadhai R\u00e1m, Misr, zamindar of Palia, in the Fyzabad district, which latter village he thenceforth made his home. Purandar R\u00e1m had five sons, whose names are marginally detailed.\n\nThe eldest of these commenced life as a trooper in the old Bengal Regular Cavalry. Whilst Bakht\u00e1war Singh was serving in this capacity at Lucknow, his fine figure and manly bearing attracted the notice of Nawab Sa\u00e1dat Ali Khan, who having obtained his discharge, appointed him a jamadar of cavalry, and shortly afterwards made him a ris\u00e1l\u00edd\u00e1r.\n\nAfter the death of Sa\u00e1dat Ali, Bakht\u00e1war Singh secured the favour of Gh\u00e1zi-ud-d\u00edn Haidar, the first king of Oudh, which led to his further advancement, and to the acquisition of the life-title of r\u00e1ja. This title was subsequently granted in perpetuity by Muhammad Ali Shah, when he also turned the Mehdona property into a r\u00e1j, under the following farm\u00e1n, under date the 13th Rabi-us-s\u00e1n\u00ed, 1253 Hijri.\n\n\"Whereas the services, intelligence, and devotion of R\u00e1ja Bakht\u00e1war Singh are well known to and appreciated by me, I therefore confer upon him the proprietary title of the Mehdona estate, to be known hereafter as a r\u00e1j, of which I constitute and appoint him the r\u00e1ja in perpetuity. All rights and interests pertaining thereto\u2014such as sir, s\u00e1yar j\u00e1g\u00edr, n\u00e1nk\u00e1r, abk\u00e1ri, transit dues, &c., as well as a revenue assignment of 42 mauzas, and some smaller holdings, are also gifted to him for ever. He is, moreover, considered the premier r\u00e1ja of Oudh, and all the other r\u00e1jas are to recognize him as such. All Government dues and revenue from the villages alluded to are released for ever, and no other is to consider himself entitled to share these bounties with the r\u00e1ja.\n\n\"The detail of the grant is as follows:\u2014\n\n\"1. Cash n\u00e1nk\u00e1r, Rs. 74,616-8-9.\n\"2. Mu'\u00edf\u00ed and j\u00e1g\u00edr lands, 41 villages, and some smaller holdings.\n\"3. Sir, 10 per cent. (? of the estate) to be revenue-free.\n\"4. S\u00e1yar, including the bazar dues of Sh\u00e1hganj, Darshannagar, and R\u00e1eganj, and all transit duties on the estate.\n\"5. Abw\u00e1b faujd\u00e1ri, including all fines levied.\n\"6. Abw\u00e1b diw\u00e1ni, including periodical tribute, occasional offerings, and fees on marriages and births.\n\n\"Bakht\u00e1war Singh then summoned his younger brother Darshan Singh to Court, and the latter soon received the command of a regiment. This was followed in 1822-23 by the appointment of Darshan Singh to the chakla of Salon and Baisw\u00e1ra, and in 1827 to the niz\u00e1mat of Sultanpur, including Fyzabad, &c. Shortly after this Darshan Singh obtained the title of R\u00e1ja Bah\u00e1d\u00far for his services to the State, in apprehending and sending in to Lucknow Shuid\u00edn Singh, Bahrela, Taluqdar of S\u00farajpur, district Bara Banki, a notorious disturber of the public peace and revenue defaulter of those days. In 1842 A.D., R\u00e1ja Darshan Singh obtained the niz\u00e1mat of Gonda Bahraich, which he had previously held for a short time in 1836, and he then seriously embroiled himself with the Naip\u00e1l\nauthorities in the following year, by pursuing the present Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja of Balr\u00e1npur, Sir Digbijai Singh, whom he accused of being a revenue defaulter into that territory. The circumstances connected with this aggression of territory are fully detailed by Sleeman at page 59, Vol. I., of his Journal. The pressure at that time put upon the king of Oudh by Lord Ellenborough, led to the dismissal from office and imprisonment of R\u00e1ja Darshan Singh, and to the resumption in direct management of the Mehdon\u00e1 estate, which the brothers had already created. But all these punishments were merely nominal, for in a very few months R\u00e1ja Darshan Singh was released from confinement, retiring for a time to the British territories, while the elder brother, R\u00e1ja Bakht\u00e9war Singh, was allowed to resume the management of the Mehdon\u00e1 estate; and this was almost immediately followed by R\u00e1ja Darshan Singh being again summoned to court, when without having performed any new service to the State, he had the further title of Saltanat-Bah\u00e1dur conferred upon him. But the r\u00e1ja did not long survive to enjoy these new honours, for within a few weeks he was seized with an illness from which he never recovered, and it was with difficulty that he was conveyed to the enchanted precincts of holy Ajodhya where he speedily breathed his last, leaving three sons whose names are marginally indicated.\n\nR\u00e1ja R\u00e1m\u00e1dh\u00edn Singh, R\u00e1ja Raghuberday\u00e1l Singh, and Mah\u00e1-r\u00e1ja M\u00e1n Singh, (originally named Hanom\u00e1 Singh.)\n\n\"In 1845 A.D., M\u00e1n Singh, the youngest of these sons, was appointed nazim of Daryabad-Rudauli, at the early age of 24, and to this charge the Sultanpur niz\u00e1mat was also afterwards added. M\u00e1n Singh soon gained his spurs by an expedition against the then owner of the S\u00farajpur estate (for overthrowing whose predecessor, Shiud\u00ed Singh, his father, had also obtained honours, in October, 1830), in the course of which that taluqdar's fort was surrounded and assaulted, and its owner, Singhji Singh, captured and sent to Lucknow (see Sleeman's Journal, page 256, Vol II.). For this service M\u00e1n Sing obtained the title of Raja-Bah\u00e1dur. In 1847 A.D., M\u00e1n Singh was ordered to proceed against the stronghold of the Gargbansi chief, Harp\u00e1l Singh.\" The details of that affair are also to be found in Sleeman's Journal, Vol. I, page 144. There are two sides to the story. The one is that Harp\u00e1l finding his fort surrounded, and resistance hopeless, surrendered at discretion and unwittingly lost his life. The other is that he was betrayed under promises of safety into a conference, and was beheaded in cold blood. One thing is certain, that the transaction was looked on in different lights at Fyzabad and at Lucknow. The local tradition of what occurred is not favourable to the chief actor in the tragedy, while the service he had performed was thought so important at the capital, that Q\u00e1emjang (steadfast in fight) was added to the existing distinctions of the young r\u00e1ja. As an impartial historian, I am bound to add that I have yet to learn that any fight at all took place, when Harp\u00e1l Singh, who was at the time in wretched health, met his death. In 1855, R\u00e1ja M\u00e1n Singh obtained the further honourary titles of Saltanat-Bah\u00e1dur for apprehending and sending to Lucknow, where he was at once put to death, the notorious proclaimed offender Jagann\u00e1th chapr\u00e1si, whose proceedings occupy no inconsiderable space in Sleeman's Journal.\n\"Almost simultaneously with the last recorded event, R\u00e1ja Bakht\u00e1war Singh died at Lucknow. He left a widowed daughter but no son, and on the evidence of Sleeman, who had good opportunities of knowing (and who wrote in February, 1850, while Bakht\u00e1war Singh still lived), he had previously nominated as his sole heir R\u00e1ja M\u00e1n Singh, the youngest of the three sons of Darshan Singh. The following is a free translation of R\u00e1ja Bakht\u00e1war Singh's last Will and Testament, now in the possession of the family of the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja:\u2014'It is known to one and all that by my own unaided exertions I obtained the favour of my sovereign who conferred on me the title of r\u00e1ja, the proprietary functions of which rank I have to this time exercised in the Mehdon\u00e1 estate, which was also created by the royal order into a r\u00e1j; and moreover other properties were also purchased or acquired by mortgage by me, which are held in the name and under the management of my brothers, R\u00e1ja Darshan Singh, Inchha Singh, and Debi-p\u00e1rsid; and also in the names of my nephews. It had recently happened that in my old age I had been imprisoned for arrears of revenue, and although my brother Inchha Singh and others of my family still lived, it fell to the lot of M\u00e1n Singh alone to assist me as a son, and by the payment of lacs of rupees to release me from my difficulties. Whereas the recollection of a man is only kept alive by the presence of offspring, and whereas I have not been blessed with a son, therefore be it known that while still in the full exercise of my senses, I have voluntarily adopted R\u00e1ja Man Singh as my own son and representative, and have made over to him, with the sanction of the Government, my entire property howsoever acquired and wheresoever situated, and whether till lately held in my own name and management or in the name and management of other members of the family. All my possessions have now been transferred by me to R\u00e1ja M\u00e1n Singh, and his name has been substituted for my own in the Government records. No brother or nephew has any right or claim against the said R\u00e1ja M\u00e1n Singh, who will be my sole representative in perpetuity. But whereas it is a duty incumbent on me and on R\u00e1ja M\u00e1n Singh to make provision for the other members of the family, both now and hereafter, therefore the following details are to be followed, so that they may never suffer from want. At the same time it is incumbent on the said relatives to treat M\u00e1n Singh as their own son, taking care that they never fail to conform to his wishes in all things. Should they fail in doing so, he has full power to resume their allowances.\n\n\"In view to these wishes being carried out this deed of gift (H\u00edb\u00e1n\u00e1ma) has been penned:\u2014\n\n**Detail.**\n\n1. To my widow ... ... Rs. 207 per mensem in cash.\n2. \" R\u00e1m\u00e1dhin Singh ... ... 600\n3. \" Raghubar Singh and his sons ... ... 500 \"\n4. Inchha Singh and his sons, Rs 500 per mensem: thus, Rs 300 to Inchha Singh and 200 to his sons.\n5. To Hardatt Singh and his brothers and his sons Rs. 300 per mensem in cash.\n6. \" Harvar\u00e1n Singh ... ... 100 \"\n7. \" Darshan Singh's temple ... ... 300 \"\nThe Sargaddw\u00e1r Th\u00e1kurdw\u00e1ra ... ... 80 \"\nThe R\u00e1jhn\u00e1t ... ... 20 \"\nThe S\u00e1rajkund ... ... 10 \"\n8. Certain lands were also assigned to different persons and objects which need not be detailed.\"\nWhen Oudh was annexed R\u00e1ja M\u00e1n Singh was found in possession of Mehdon\u00e1, the family property, with a then paying jama, after deduction of Rs. 66,053 n\u00e1nk\u00e1r, of Rs. 1,91,174.\n\nHe was at that time returned as a defaulter to the extent of Rs. 50,000 of revenue due to the ex-king. In consequence he was deprived at the first summary settlement of his entire estate, and sought refuge for a time in Calcutta. This did not, however, prevent his offering protection and convoy to such of the Fyzabad officials as chose to accept it, when they had to flee from Fyzabad, nor did it prevent him from procuring boats for them, and starting them safely on their voyage down the river.\n\nThe mutiny found the r\u00e1ja a prisoner in our hands, and he was released in order that he might protect our women and children. Of these proceedings the Deputy Commissioner, Captain Reid, at the time thus wrote:\n\n\"Without R\u00e1ja M\u00e1n Singh's assistance it would have been quite impossible to get away this large number, and for his good services he well deserves our gratitude. I was always opposed to the plan of imprisoning him. He was the only man who could have saved Fyzabad aided by our treasury, and I believe he would have done it.\"\n\nAt a subsequent period the r\u00e1ja was instrumental in saving Mrs. Mill and other Europeans, who certified to his uniform kindness and consideration.\n\nOn these services Sir John Lawrence made the following remarks on the occasion of his great Lucknow Darb\u00e1r:\n\n\"You have in my estimation a special claim to honour and gratitude, inasmuch at the commencement of the mutiny in 1857, you gave refuge to more than fifty English people in your fort at Fyzabad, most of whom were helpless women and children, and thus, by God's mercy, were instrumental in saving all their lives.\"\n\nIn the earlier days of the mutiny, Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja M\u00e1n Singh remained in constant communication with Mr. Gubbins, the former Financial Commissioner, and Sir Charles Wingfield, who was then at Gorakhpur, and he was an earnest advocate for an advance against Lucknow by the Gogra and Fyzabad route. So long as there was a chance of such a movement being carried out, he never wavered in his allegiance to the British Government, but having previously made it distinctly known that such would of necessity be the result if no such movement was speedily carried out, no sooner did he hear that the scheme of an advance by the Gogra route had been abandoned, than he proceeded to join the rebel cause at Lucknow.\n\nDuring the siege of the Residency, although the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja had command of an important rebel post, he was in frequent communication with the garrison, and there is little question that had his heart been in the rebel cause, he could have made our position even more disagreeable than it was, and colour is given to this belief from the fact, that when Lucknow fell, M\u00e1n Singh returned to his fort of Sh\u00e1hganj, where he in turn was\nbesieged by the rebels, and had actually to be relieved by a force under Sir H. Grant.\n\nOn the return of peace, the title of Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja was conferred on M\u00e1n Singh. The estate he possessed at annexation was restored to him, and the confiscated property of the Raja of Gonda was made over to him in proprietary title for his services.\n\nIn the great Oudh controversies that have for several years engaged so large a share of the public attention, Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja M\u00e1n Singh was the mouthpiece, as he undoubtedly also represented the intellect of the taluqdars; and it was for the assistance rendered in bringing these controversies to a satisfactory close, that he had so recently been decorated by command of Her Majesty with the Star of India. The words of the Viceroy on presenting this decoration were these:\u2014\u201cMah\u00e1r\u00e1ja M\u00e1n Singh, Her Majesty the Queen of England and India, having heard of your good services in various important matters connected with the administration of the province of Oudh, has thought fit to appoint you a Knight Commander of the Most Exalted Order of the Star of India.\u201d\n\nIt will thus be seen that the Sh\u00e1hganj family is but of yesterday. It was created by a daring soldier of fortune, and it was ennobled by another, who to courage of an admittedly high order, added an intellect than which there were few more able or more subtle.\n\nSince this biography was sketched, the subject of it has been gathered to his fathers. He died in his 50th year after a protracted illness of eighteen months, contracted in the over-zealous performance of onerous duties connected with the final settlement and consolidation of the taluq-dari system of Oudh.\n\nIt is a remarkable circumstance that the year 1870 has proved fatal to all the three sons of R\u00e1ja Darshan Singh. R\u00e1ja Raghubarday\u00e1l, the second son, died on the second May, 1870; Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja Sir M\u00e1n Singh, K.C.S.I., the youngest, on the 11th October, 1870, and R\u00e1ja R\u00e1m\u00e1dh\u00edn, the eldest, on the 13th November, 1870. Of these the first mentioned will ever be remembered with a shudder by the readers of Sleeman\u2019s Journal, as the cruel official devastator of the Trans-Gogra districts. The latter long devoted himself with credit to the management of the family property, but in consequence of a petty zanana dispute he relinquished the charge and betook himself for several years to a life of devotion at Benares. He, however, returned to Oudh shortly before the province was annexed, and since then the brothers have made Sh\u00e1hganj a fortified town, founded by the uncle and father, and which is situated 14 miles south of Fyzabad, their general residence.\n\nMah\u00e1r\u00e1ja M\u00e1n Singh has left a daughter who has a son, Kunwar Part\u00e1b Narain Singh, to whom it was his intention that his fine estate, which at present yields a revenue of Rs. 4,32,128 per annum to Government (not including the Gonda property) should eventually descend, but the will leaves the property to the widow who is not the lad\u2019s grandmother, and to her is assigned the duty of finally naming the heir,\nThe will is in the following terms:\n\n\"Whereas my intentions as to the nomination of any of the youths (of the family) as my representative have not as yet been finally matured, it is necessary in the meantime to appoint the Mahar\u00e1ni as representative and proprietrix, that she, until such time as she may appoint a representative, may remain as my representative and proprietrix, but without the power of transfer. No co-sharer has any concern whatever with my property, real or personal. I have therefore written and filed this will and testament, that at the proper time it may take effect. Dated 22nd April, 1862.\"\n\nThe other brothers, who were men of an altogether inferior stamp, have each left several sons, who are supported by the estate.\n\nIt is popularly averred, with what truth it is hard to say, that on one occasion R\u00e1ja Bakht\u00e1war Singh intimated his intention of leaving his estates to Rim\u00e1dhin, his riches to Rughubarday\u00e1l, and his army to his favourite, M\u00e1n Singh. He was asked how the army was to be supported without property or wealth, and he is said to have replied naively,\u2014\"I am no judge of men, if he who gets the army does not very soon possess himself of the estates and the treasure as well.\" Be the truth of this story what it may, the Mahar\u00e1ja rested his right and title to the estates on R\u00e1ja Bakht\u00e1war Singh's last will and testament, a free translation of which has already been given.\n\nThe following letters referred to the Mahar\u00e1ja's services during the mutiny:\n\n\"The undersigned being about to leave the escort of R\u00e1ja M\u00e1n Singh, desire to place on record the high sense they entertain of the services he has rendered them.\n\n\"When the danger of the mutiny of the troops at Fyzabad became imminent, he came forward of his own accord and offered an asylum to all the ladies and children at his fort of Sh\u00e1hganj, and his offer was gladly accepted, and eight women and fourteen children of this party (besides three others) were sent there.\n\n\"Shortly after the emeute took place they were joined by their husbands, and R\u00e1ja M\u00e1n Singh made arrangements to forward the whole by water to Dinapore.\n\n\"Though the party lost their money and valuables en route (this was owing to an untoward accident which the raja could not possibly have foreseen), the voyage on the whole has been as satisfactory as could be expected, and free from the extreme misery and discomfort which other refugees have experienced.\n\n\"Without the personal aid of the raja, it would have been quite impracticable to get off such a large number of persons (29). There can be no\ndoubt that under Providence we are indebted to him for our safe passage to this place.\n\n(Sd). J. Reid, Capt.\n\u201e A. P. Orr, Capt.\n\u201e F. A. V.

Commr.\"\n\nGOPALPUR,\nThe 24th June, 1857.\n\n\"This is to certify that by the kind assistance of R\u00e1ja M\u00e1n Singh, I and my three children, and also three sergeants' wives, with their families, have been protected, and our lives, indeed, saved.\n\n\"When the disturbance took place at Fyzabad my husband, Major Mill, Artillery, had made, as he imagined, every careful arrangement for the safety of myself and our children, but by some mismanagement and untoward circumstances, of which I know not the cause, it appears he was obliged to fly without me, though he gave orders for me to be sent for. As I and the children were hidden and placed under (on the night of the 7th June) the care of a person who had promised to do everything that was needed but who proved false to his trust, I did not get a boat till Wednesday, the 9th, and that was through other people's influence. I proceeded scarcely above a mile from Gupt\u00e1r Gh\u00e1t when my boat was stopped by order of the sepoys of the 6th Regiment Oudh Irregular Infantry, and several came on board and threatened to kill me and my children unless I immediately left the boat, which I therefore was obliged to do. I was told that we should be killed if we remained in the station, and the same fate would also await me if I took another boat; however I determined to try if safety could be obtained by water, and engaged a small boat, for which I had to pay 80 rupees. I was taken over to the opposite side, and there again threatened with death from every one I met, as the Delhi B\u00e9dsh\u00e1h had given orders to that effect. We were then put on shore, hurriedly left there, and all my property left behind. I wandered from village to village with my children for about a fortnight, existing on the charity of the villagers, when R\u00e1ja M\u00e1n Singh discovered the fact, and most generously took us under his care, and has been exceedingly kind and attentive, providing us with all we needed, food and clothing; and he is now about to send me on towards Gorakhpur, to the charge of Mr. Osborne, by the request of Mr. Paterson. I most sincerely hope and trust Government will amply reward the R\u00e1ja for his uniform kindness to all Europeans; had R\u00e1ja M\u00e1n Singh not protected us we must all have perished, and we are deeply indebted to him for his great assistance.\n\n\"OUDH,\nThe 7th July, 1857.\n\n(Rajputs ... ... 24 per cent.\nBrahmans ... ... 29 \"\nKoris, Kurmis, and Ahirs 16 \"\nMusalmans ... ... 7 \"\nOther castes ... ... 24 \"\n\n\"(Sd.)

Astik.\u2014In mauza P\u00farai B\u00edrbal a fair is held for two or three days in the month of S\u00e1wan, in connexion with the feast of snakes (N\u00e1g Panchmi), which is attended by some hundreds of people of the neighbourhood who go to make offerings at this shrine.\n\n(2.) S\u00edtakund.\u2014In mauza Taron D\u00e1r\u00e1bganj a fair is held in K\u00e1rtik and Chait, where those of the neighbours assemble who cannot join in the larger half-yearly gatherings at Ajodhya for the purpose of commemorating important events in the life of R\u00e1m Chandar. The tradition is that S\u00edta offered sacrifice at this place on her way back from the wilds, and dug the tank in which the pilgrims bathe to commemorate the event.\n\n(3.) S\u00farajkund.\u2014In mauza R\u00e1mpur Bhagan 1,000 or 1,200 people assemble here the first Sunday after the 6th day of Bh\u00e1don to commemorate the birth of the sun. During the day salt in every shape is eschewed, and a strict fast, extending even to abstaining from drinking water, is maintained from sunset till sunrise the next morning.\n\nPACHHOHA Pargana\u2014Tahsil SHAHABAD\u2014District HARDOL.\u2014This pargana is bounded on the north by the Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur district of the North-Western Provinces, on the east by pargana Shahabad, on the south by Pali pargana, and on the west by the districts of Farukhabad and Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur. The area is 56,280 acres or about 88 square miles, divided as follows:\n\n- Cultivated: 42,861 acres\n- Irrigated: 13,808 \"\n- Unirrigated: 28,559 \"\n- Culturable: 10,275 \"\n- Unculturable: 3,644 \"\n\nTotal: 56,280 \"\n\nThe soil is chiefly bh\u00fbr (sandy). There are two rivers\u2014the Garra and the Sunsaha Chanab. There is only one road from Thatheora to Farukhabad. The Government revenue demand amounts to Rs. 44,284-2-6. There are 17 schools and two post-offices. The population is 30,420; the number of houses 4,980.\n\nPachhoha pargana was in the Nawabi, included in Pali. In 1834 the pargana was named \"Pachhoha Deh\u00e1t,\" and a tahsildar was appointed owing to the defalcation of the Pachhoha zamindars. This tahsildar resided at Bilsar. Pachhoha was formed into a separate pargana after annexation. The village of Pachhoha lies west of the fort of Pali, and hence the name. The zamindars are mostly Panw\u00e2rs.\nPAH\u00c1RAPUR Pargana\u2014Tahsil GONDA\u2014District GONDA.\u2014This pargana is bounded on the north by pargana Gonda, on the south by Guw\u00e1rich, on the west by His\u00e1mpur of the Bahraich district, and on the east by some villages of pargana Gonda. Formerly it contained only 63,193 acres, divided into 114 villages, but since the recent survey in 1876, 14 more villages, with an area of 10,098 acres, have been transferred to this pargana from His\u00e1mpur. Now therefore the pargana contains 128 villages, with an area of 73,391 acres, or 115 square miles. The surface is level; unculturable land amounts to 7,346 acres, barren land to 15,026 acres, and groves cover 3,880 acres. The irrigated land is 8,095 acres, or 19 per cent., and unirrigated 39,044 acres or 81 per cent. There are no forests within the limits of the pargana. There are no large rivers. The Tirhi, which traverses the pargana from west to east, is neither used for navigation nor irrigation. It does mischief during the rains by inundating the villages which border it.\n\nThe only crop peculiar to this pargana is d\u00fcnsi dh\u00e1n, which is sown in Bais\u00e1kh (April) and cut in S\u00e1wan (July). It is never in danger of being submerged by the flood, as it continues to grow as the water rises, so that its top is never covered. Water is met with at 6 to 9 feet from the surface. There is no disease peculiar to the pargana. During October and November fever is somewhat prevalent.\n\nThe revenue of the pargana amounts to Rs. 98,618-2-0, Rs. 91,328, being land revenue and Rs. 2,290-2-0 cesses.\n\nThe pargana is held chiefly by the r\u00e1jas of Kap\u00farthala and Singha Chanda. The Bishambharpur estate belongs to the heirs of Mah r\u00e1ja M\u00e1n Singh.\n\nThe villages are thus held:\u2014\n\n| Taluqdar\u00ed | Zamindar\u00ed | Pattidar\u00ed | Bhayyach\u00e1ra |\n|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------------|\n|           |           |           |             |\n|           |           |           |             |\n\nIncluding coparcenary muh\u00e1ls.\n\nThe tribal distribution of property is as follows:\u2014\n\n| Brahman | Bais Chhattri | Kalbans Chhattri | Musalm\u00e1n | N\u00e1naksh\u00e1hi faq\u00edr | Chaub\u00e1n Chhattri | Gosh\u00e1in | Janw\u00e1r Chhattri | Balr\u00e1gi faq\u00edr | Kurmi |\n|---------|---------------|------------------|----------|-----------------|-----------------|--------|----------------|--------------|-------|\n|         |               |                  |          |                 |                 |        |                |              |       |\n|         |               |                  |          |                 |                 |        |                |              |       |\n\nTotal 128 villages.\n\nThe total population amounts to 46,990.

The country was then in the possession of N\u00fale S\u00e1h, a Th\u00e1ru chief. This was at the time when Judhishtir, the hero of the Mah\u00e1bharath, reigned at Hastinapur. Some time after the Th\u00e1ru line became extinct, and R\u00e1ja Pithora of Delhi annexed this country to his kingdom. On the fall of the Hindus at Delhi, and the ascendency of the Muhammadans, Chh\u00edtan, a Brahman, became lord of it. Nothing further is known till the end of the 17th century when (1692) R\u00e1ja Datt Singh, of Gonda, annexed this country to his dominions, and gave it the name of Pah\u00e1rapur. Since this time it has remained in the uninterrupted possession of the Gonda r\u00e1jas.\n\nThe only famous battle is that fought between Al\u00e1wal Khan N\u00e1z\u00edm and R\u00e1ja Datt Singh of Gonda. It occurred at B\u00e1lpur Gh\u00e1t, cost the life of the N\u00e1z\u00edm himself and thousands of his followers.\n\n*This is crossed by the road that leads from Gonda to Bahramghat.\n\u2020This is crossed by the road from Colonelganj to Balrampur. A wooden bridge is only kept up in the dry weather.*\nThere is no religious building in this pargana which particularly requires notice. The only fair is that held in Ph\u00e1gun on Shiar\u00e1tr\u00ed in honour of Barkhandi N\u00e1th Mah\u00e1deo.\n\nKatra bazar is the only place in the pargana which has a population of over 2,000\n\n**PAILA Pargana\u2014Tahsil LAKH\u00cdMPUR\u2014District KHERI.\u2014** Pargana Paila includes the old pargana of Karanpur which has lately been joined to it. It now contains 119 villages covering an area of 105 square miles. The general features and history of the two portions of the pargana\u2014viz., pargana Paila proper and the old pargana of Karanpur, which were separately assessed, are as follows:\n\nPargana Paila proper is bounded on the north by the old pargana of Karanpur, on the east by pargana Kheri, on the south by pargana Bas\u00e1ra, and on the west by parganas Kasta and Sikandarabad. It contains 59 regularly demarcated villages, comprising a total area of 32,910 acres or 51\u00b742 square miles, with a population of 345 to the square mile. The cultivated area is 17,649 and the culturable and fallow 11,091 acres more, or a total assessed area of 28,740 acres, out of 4,170 acres. Of the unassessable area there are 910 acres under groves, and 32 acres still released as rent-free grants, which latter have now been separately assessed at Rs. 74. There are 4,243 cultivators and 3,419 ploughs, being 1\u00b724 men and 5\u00b716 acres of cultivation to each plough. Again, the percentage of the irrigated land is 32 from wells and tanks chiefly. The pargana is almost entirely free of jungle; it has much good average loam and clay soils; and in certain localities a good deal of wet land producing two crops a year. Owing to some feuds between R\u00e1ja Lone Singh and R\u00e1ja Anrudh Singh of Oel, several of the villages, Atwa, Shankarpur, &c., to the north of the pargana were destroyed and thrown out of cultivation since 1248-49 fasli, when R\u00e1ja Lone Singh got these villages in his lease under the Huz\u00far Tahsil. Many of these villages were in possession of the R\u00e1ja of Oel at the time. According to Colonel Sleeman\u2019s account \u201cR\u00e1ja Lone Singh got the lease in March, 1840, and commenced his attack in May.\u201d The result was, a great fight occurred between him and the Oel r\u00e1ja on the Paila plain, and Lone Singh is represented to have been beaten back and lost some of his guns. The R\u00e1ja of Oel eventually left the villages he held. These villages are now held by several of the grantees, and are now only beginning to revive.\n\nIn Atwa and Shankarpur and some others large areas are still waste, but rapidly are being brought under the plough. The soil in these villages is everywhere good.\n\nThe largest jhil is at the village of Kutwa; it is a long narrow deep jhil, with high and sandy banks on both sides, which prevent the lands being irrigated from it. After the rains another jhil is formed in the hollow of some low land lying between the villages ef Ras\u00falpur and Kishanpur on one side, and Part\u00e1bpur and Sajw\u00e1n on the other side. At certain seasons much of the waste is available for irrigation, and the flooding from the jhil adds much to the fertility of the adjoining lands. There are two streams,\nwhich partly form the boundary of the pargana, the Jamwari on the north-east and Sarayan in the south-west, but at present very little use is made of the water of these rivers.\n\n**Nature of tenures and number of villages.**\u2014The following are the varieties of the tenures in the 59 villages of this pargana:\n\n| Tenure          | Number |\n|-----------------|--------|\n| Taluqdari       | 38     |\n| Decreed to Government | 6     |\n| Pattidari       | 2      |\n| Zamindari       | 18     |\n\nThese are all khalsa villages; of these 48 villages were formerly given over to grantees. Subsequently Gay\u00e1 Parshad, grantee, was allowed to exchange four villages he held in this pargana for other villages in the Unao district; so these and two others have been decreed to Government, the remaining nine villages are still held by the former proprietors. Paila was formerly a part of Nimkh\u00e1r pargana.\n\nThat portion of the Paila pargana which was formerly the Karanpur pargana is separated from Haidarabad on the west by a curious range of low sand hills, with sal jungle along both bases and a succession of jhils; these at Kaimahra become a river which flows west and joins the Kathna; formerly probably a branch of the Chauka passed down here. After leaving these hills the pargana presents the appearance of a flat plain well watered with numerous jhils and large wells. Water is more abundant than in Haidarabad, but so is \u00fasar. After passing the river Jamwari the soil is lighter, but water is everywhere plentiful from rivers, jhils, or wells, which unlike those of Haidarabad are often stable enough for using leather buckets. Towards the north the boundary is the Ul for 14 miles, but this is hardly available for irrigation on account of the height of the banks. The Karanpur pargana was likewise formerly a part of the Bh\u00farw\u00e1ra, and one of the earliest seats of the Ahbans. The present village (Bh\u00farw\u00e1ra) lies a mile south of the Ul, and the whole way along the banks of this river to R\u00e1mpur Gokul; remains of old buildings are numerous opposite Fatehpur Karra; near the latter place there are numerous mounds, and wherever the earth has been turned up large blocks of carved stone, capitals of pitters, friezes, and architraves have been discovered. Silver and gold coins of the Kanauj series have been found in considerable numbers. The original zamindars are Ahbans. The Bh\u00farw\u00e1ra estate was divided among the five sons of Muhammad Husen Khan mentioned in \"Sleeman's Tour.\" Siath\u00fa, with Kupia Murtehar; belongs to a family headed by Im\u00e1m Ali Kh\u00e1n. The Janw\u00e1rs represented by the R\u00e1ja of Oel and Th\u00e1kur of Mahewa seized a number of villages between 1840 and 1850. Simrai, an old village on the bank of the largest jhil in the district, and several villages round it, then passed into the hands of the Th\u00e1kur of Mahewa, who had held the village of Karanpur before.\n\nThe Karanpur pargana contained 60 villages covering an area of 54 square miles, principally owned by the Janw\u00e1rs of Kheri, the lords of Mahewa and Oel; their occupation is a recent one.\nPAILA\u2014Pargana PAILA\u2014Tahsil LAKHYMPUR\u2014District KHERI.\u2014The town of Paila is built on some high land, looks very dilapidated now, and is nothing beyond an ordinary-sized village; the residents being chiefly Brahmins, Kurmis, P\u00e1sis, and Cham\u00e1rs. The returns showing a population of 1,613 in 317 houses. No trade seems to be carried on in the town.\n\nPAINTEPUR*\u2014Pargana MAHMUDABAD\u2014Tahsil B\u00c1RI\u2014District SITAPUR.\u2014This town lies in about 3 miles west of the high road from Bahramghat to Sitapur, which latter place is 42 miles south-east; latitude 27\u00b014' north, and longitude 81\u00b013' east.\n\nThe town is said to have been founded 300 years ago by one Paint P\u00e1l, an Ahban R\u00e1ja of Maholi, and to have been named after him. It is now the residence of K\u00e1zim Husen Kh\u00e1n, who owns estates in the neighbourhood, and who is cousin of the Taluqdar of Mahmudabad, four miles off. The population is 5,127, there being about seven Hindus to every Musalman. The only Government building in the town is the school at which the average daily attendance is 70. Paintepur contains 1,189 mud-built and but two masonry houses, one of which latter is the taluqdar's residence\u2014a substantial edifice.\n\nThe local bazar is held on Sundays and Tuesdays; and in the month of December there is a fair at which all the commodities in ordinary demand are to be purchased. The annual value of all sales is estimated at Rs. 1,31,060. There is a large community of bankers settled here, in addition to whom, the Bani\u00e1n element is strong in the town, which on the whole is flourishing and of considerable local importance.\n\nPALI Pargana\u2020\u2014Tahsil SHAHABAD\u2014District HARDOL.\u2014A light sandy tract in the south-eastern corner of the Shahabad tahsil, between the Garra and Sendha rivers. On the east the Garra separates it from parganas Shahabad and Saromannagar, and on the west and south-west the Sendha from parganas Allahganj (Farukabad) and Kati\u00e1ri. Barwan adjoins it on the south and Pachhoha on the north. In an area of 73 square miles, of which 46 are cultivated, it contains 92 villages. In shape it is irregularly square, with a maximum length and breadth of nearly 12 and 11 miles respectively. Its general aspect is thus described in Captain Gordon Young's assessment note book:\n\n\"The whole, as a rule, is bh\u00far, not necessarily of one standard, but generally light and sandy. There are, however, strips of tar\u00e1i or low-lying moist lands all along the Garra, and by the sides of the long jh\u00edls which intersect the pargana from north to south. Between these jh\u00edls are long high tracts of bh\u00far, and along the sides of the jh\u00edls and between these ridges are strips of tar\u00e1i. From Pali to Sahjanpur all is bh\u00far of the very sandiest, with numerous shifting sand-hills brought into position by any stump or scrub which arrests the eddy and thus forms the nucleus of a sand hill. If vegetation gets a hold on the hillock it is probably stationary for ever, otherwise the first high wind carries it away to another spot.\"\n\n* By Mr. Ferrar, C.S., Assistant Commissioner.\n\u2020 By Mr. A H. Harington, C.S., Assistant Commissioner.\nThe villages skirting the Garra though light of soil are the best in the pargana. In some of them the lands by percolation from the river remain moist till March or April, so that irrigation is scarcely required. In others, where the river runs between higher banks and with a narrower flood-basin, fine crops of opium, tobacco, and vegetables are raised along the river bank, owing to the ease with which a never-failing supply of water is drawn from it by lever (dhenkli) wells. To the west of these villages, with an average breadth of about three miles, runs parallel with the Garra a belt of high, dry, uneven, unproductive bh\u00fbr.\n\nAll the villages in this tract have been rated in the third or fourth class. Here rents are low and wells are few. In some of the villages there is no irrigation at all. To the west of this tract, and up to the boundary stream, the Sendha, breadths of dh\u00e2k jungle copiously intersected by narrow marshy jhils, along whose edges cultivation is gradually extending, alternate with treeless ridges of thinly cropped bh\u00fbr. Many of the jungle villages are fairly productive with average soil and good water-supply, but in some the soil is cold, stiff, and unproductive, and in almost all cultivators are still scarce, rents low, and mischief done by forest animals considerable. In the extreme west of the pargana, as in the east along the Garra, a narrow strip of moderately good villages fringes the Sendha. There is not a mile of road in the whole pargana. Cart-tracks wind deviously from village to village. Along these, except in the rainy season, a light bullock cart (Shikram) can be driven without much difficulty.\n\nThe staple products are b\u00e2jra and barley, which, in the year of survey, occupied three-fifths of the crop area. Wheat, arhar, rice, and gram made up the greater part of the remainder. Tobacco, opium, and kitchen vegetables are raised principally in Pali, Nizampur, Amt\u00e2ra, Barw\u00e2ra, Lakanaur, and Bharkani. The nodular limestone (kankar) is found at Morair and Behti.\n\nRent-rates vary from Rs. 10-8 and more per settlement b\u00eegha (gths of an acre) on market gardeners\u2019 lands in Pali to nine annas on the dry uneven bh\u00fbr. Cash rents prevail; but here and there payments are still made in kind.\n\nSombansi Rajputs hold more than half the pargana; Brahmans nearly a fifth; Muhammadans a tenth. Three villages have been decreed to Government. The tenure is zamindari in 56 and imperfect pattidari in 17 villages; 19 belong to the Sewaichpur taluqa.\n\nExcluding cesses, the Government demand is Rs. 37,041, a rise of 47 per cent. on the summary assessment. It falls at only Re. 1-4-1 per cultivated acre; Re. 0-12-8 per acre of total area; Rs. 10-8-5 per plough; Re. 1-13-2 per head of the agricultural, and Re. 1-5-1 per head of the total population.\nThe number of inhabitants is 28,087, or 385 to the square mile. Hindus to Muhammadans are 25,578 to 2,509, males to females 15,243 to 12,841, and agriculturists to non-agriculturists 20,298 to 7,789. More than a fourth of the Hindus are Brahmans; Cham\u00e1rs and Chhattris each constitute a ninth; Mur\u00e1os a twelfth; Kah\u00e1rs, Ah\u00edrs, and K\u00eds\u00e1ns predominate in the remainder.\n\nThere are no important fairs. Village schools have been established at the following places\u2014Pali, Sahjanpur, Babarpur, Madnapur, Sar\u00e1e, and Lakm\u00e1pur.\n\nThe only market is at Pali on Sundays and Thursdays.\n\nFor some account of the past history of the pargana see Pali town. The q\u00e1n\u00fangos say that Pali has been a pargana for seven hundred years\u2014i.e., since Shah\u00e1b-ud-d\u00edn\u2019s conquest. It is probable that if not so ancient as this, its formation into a revenue subdivision dates at least from the reign of Hum\u00e1y\u00fan. In the A'in-i-Akbari it is mentioned as containing 56,156 bighas, and as paying 12,061,230 d\u00e1ms of revenue, and 36,488 dams are set down as j\u00e1g\u00edr. No fort is mentioned, but there was a garrison of 30 troopers, 1,000 foot-soldiers. Ananas (?) are entered as the zamindars. Pali originally contained the whole of what are now parganas Shahabad and Pachhoha, and a part of parganas Saroman-nagar and Kati\u00e1ri.\n\nPALI*\u2014Pargana PALI\u2014Tahsil SHAHABAD\u2014District HARDOI.\u2014(Population 5,122.) The chief town of pargana Pali lies in latitude 27\u00b030' north, longitude 79\u00b0 44' east, and is pleasantly situated on the right bank of the river Garra on the old route from Fatehgarh to Sitapur, nine miles south-west from Shahabad, 18 miles north from S\u00e1ndi, 20 north-west from Hardoi, 19 north-east from Farukhabad, 64 west from Sitapur and 90 north-west from Lucknow. Its general appearance was thus described by General Sleeman twenty-three years ago:\n\n\"The road for the last half way of this morning's stage (along the Sandi road) passes over a good doomuteea soil. The whole country is well cultivated and well studded with fine trees, and the approach to Palee at this season (January) is very picturesque. The groves of mango and other fine trees, amidst which the town stands on the right bank of the Gurra river, appear very beautiful as one approaches, particularly now that the surrounding country is covered by so fine a carpet of rich spring crops. The sun's rays falling upon such rich masses of foliage produce an infinite variety of form, colour, and tint, on which the eye delights to repose.\"\u2014Sleeman's Tour, Vol. II., page 40.\n\nThe Garra here is fordable at R\u00e1jgh\u00e1t for about five months of the year. A ferry is kept up at other times. The river has shifted a good deal northwards away from the town within the last forty years.\n\nLocal tradition describes the circumstances of its foundation, but does not furnish any clue to the derivation of the name. The tract of coun-\n\n* By Mr. A. H. Harington, C.S., Assistant Commissioner.\ntry of which Pali is the centre was conquered from the Thatheras by the Sombansis under R\u00e1ja S\u00e1tan before the Muhammadan conquest.\n\nThe name may, not improbably, be connected with the P\u00e1l dynasty of Kanauj, from which place Pali is distant only 34 miles.\n\nThe founding of Pali is placed by local tradition at the close of the twelfth century, shortly after the great campaign of Shah\u00e1b-ud-d\u00edn Ghori, and the downfall of the R\u00e1thor dynasty of Kanauj. In those days the country round Pali was ruled from S\u00e1tannagar (S\u00e1ndi) by the Sombansi R\u00e1ja Harhar, surnamed Shius\u00e1l Deo, son of R\u00e1ja S\u00e1tan. The office of mace-bearer at R\u00e1ja Harhar's court belonged hereditarily to a powerful family called variously Gabrs (fire-worshippers) and Kis\u00e1ns. They lived a little to the west of the present town of Pali on the new ruined site called S\u00e1ndi Khera, and enjoyed the revenues of a considerable tract lying round it, known then as S\u00e1ndi Pali. These Gabrs (or Kis\u00e1ns) seized the opportunity of the Ghorian invasion to revolt from their prince, and possess themselves of his dominion. Harhar strove in vain to recover it. In his strait he despatched Gi\u00e1m P\u00e1nde, his family priest, to his brother, a ris\u00e1ld\u00e1r in the Musalman garrison of Kanauj. At his request troops were sent from thence under the command of Shekh Mo\u00edn-ud-d\u00edn Usm\u00e1ni, son of H\u00e1ji S\u00e1l\u00e1r. The upstart Gabrs were crushed; R\u00e1ja Harhar was restored. Shekh Mo\u00edn-ud-d\u00edn, Gi\u00e1m P\u00e1nde, and his brother, the ris\u00e1ld\u00e1r, were each rewarded with a rent-free grant of five hundred bighas. Settling down on their grants they gradually cleared away the forest along the river bank, and founded the present town of Pali. The Brahmans established themselves to the north and the Shekhs to the south of the site. The former became the chau-dhirs and the Shekhs the q\u00e1z\u00eds of the tract. At this day Shekh Mo\u00edn-ud-d\u00edn is represented in Pali by his descendants Shekhs Naz\u00edr Ahmad, Tajammul Husen, and Q\u00e1zi Niw\u00e1zish Ali; Gi\u00e1m P\u00e1nde by Chaudhri Hanwant Singh, and the ris\u00e1ld\u00e1r by Chaudhris R\u00e1e Singh, Dari\u00e9e Singh, and Buddhi Singh. Mr. Carnegy (I do not know upon what authority) assigns a much later date to the founding of the Shekh colony at Pali under Shekh Mo\u00edn-ud-d\u00edn:\u2014\u201cThere, about \u201c1350, really began the Muhammadan immigration. Shekh Mo\u00edn-ud-\u201cd\u00edn, grandson of a lieutenant of Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn Khilji, Governor of Oudh, \u201cstationed at Kanauj, crossed over to Pali and established a colony which \u201cwas afterwards increased by the assimilation of numerous adventurers.\u201d (Notes on Tribes, page 66.)\n\nIn the Nawabi, from 1839 to 1854, the n\u00e1ib or deputy chakladar of the S\u00e1ndi Pali chakla, or revenue circle, was stationed at Pali.\n\nThere are five muhallas or wards\u2014(1) the Shekhs quarter, (2) Q\u00e1zi Sar\u00e1\u00e9, (3) the Malik and Path\u00e1ns quarters, (4) the Maghrabi or western quarter, inhabited exclusively by Path\u00e1ns, and (5) the Hindu town, in which P\u00e1nde and other Brahmans preponderate. The Hindu town looks well to do, but the Muhammadan muhallas have, for the most part, a decayed and impoverished appearance. The resumption of rent-free grants, and the loss of Government service, have been felt here as elsewhere. Out of 1055 houses only 32 are of brick. There are two mosques and a\nth\u00e1kurdw\u00e1ra. One of the mosques is a very showy florid structure, built recently by Ris\u00e1ld\u00e1r Imti\u00e1z Ali, the principal Muhammadan resident.\n\nA brick school-house was built in 1865. The school is a village one, with an average attendance of 60 pupils. There is a small mud-built S\u00e1r\u00e1e, which is repaired annually from local funds. At the market on Sundays and Thursdays grain, salt, vegetables, tobacco, and cloth are bought and sold. The only shops are those of two grain-sellers, two confectioners and one seller of p\u00e1n-leaf. A little coarse country cloth is manufactured.\n\nPALIA Pargana\u2014Tahsil NIGH\u00c1SAN\u2014District KHERI.\u2014This pargana lies between the S\u00e1rda on the south and the Suheli\u2014an old, channel of the Chauka\u2014on the north; it is bounded by Nigh\u00e1san pargana on the west, by the Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur district and a portion of Naip\u00e1l on the east. It is 23 miles long and 11 miles broad; its area is 139 square miles, divided into 50 townships. Of cultivated land there are 37 square miles. Much of the arable land recorded as barren being included in the Government forest, there is really hardly any barren land in the pargana. The level lies generally very high, quite above the reach of inundation, still it is not so elevated as that beyond the Suheli northwards, and the forest generally consists therefore not of s\u00e1l but of dh\u00e1k, khair, and shisham. Up till 50 years ago the S\u00e1rda ran in the channel now indifferently called the Suheli or Sarju. Into this fell two streams called the Buri and the Newri, with its affluent the Nagraur. When the S\u00e1rda changed its course more to the south past Maraungh\u00e1 Gh\u00e1t, the rivulets above mentioned continued to supply a scanty stream, which now does not cover a tenth of the channel formerly belonging to the S\u00e1rda. The Suheli is a picturesque little stream running under high banks, and generally fringed with extensive shisham forest; its breadth opposite Khairigarh is not above twenty yards. In some places, where the ancient river scoured deeply, its waters are deep, dark, and sluggish, but it is generally easily fordable, the depth not exceeding three feet. It is much used for rafting timber from the Government forests to Bahramghat on the Kauri\u00e1la.\n\nThe eastern portion of the pargana from Tikaulia lies very high and quite beyond the reach of floods, but much of it has been cut away recently by the Chauka. Westward, however, from Tikaulia and Pat\u00edhan the whole of the land almost is the alluvial deposit left by the S\u00e1rda in its various wanderings. There are innumerable channels, some dry and silted up, others containing stagnant water and treacherous quicksands, others in which tiny streams still flow over dark quaking mud\u2014all are generally covered with magnificent crops of the narkul, a gigantic reed, whose waving plumes of pure white floesey filaments cover acres of ground surrounded by the dark green grasses and conf\u00e9rv\u00e6. Crossing one of these streams at Tikaulia we enter a large tract running up to the north-west, which formerly belonged to Khairigarh, where the river S\u00e1rda ran in the channel above pointed out. Recently it has been demarcated with Palia without much reason, as the entire tract belongs to the R\u00e1ja of Khairigarh. It is an extensive prairie, edged near the rivers with fine shisham woods for many miles. The traveller on an elephant even will seldom be able to see more than a few\nyards on each side, the grass is so dense and lofty that numerous herds of nil-g\u00e1\u00e9, spotted deer, and black buck\u2014when the grass is shorter\u2014range over this primeval waste. A few villages, with narrow belt of cultivation, can be discovered by means of a guide; for such is the density of the vegetation that the low lands of the peasantry are quite buried in the prairie grass, and the traveller may be within a few yards of a large village without being aware of it.\n\nThe pargana is not a healthy one. Even villages, which are well situated on dry and elevated spots far from marshes, seem to be affected by malaria, as well as those of the low-lying tracts. But, indeed, only about one-fourth of the pargana, the south-eastern portion, a belt about three miles broad skirting the Chauka from Marauncha Gh\u00e1t, really can boast of such conditions of soil, elevation, and climate as conduce to health. To the west fever and cattle-murrain are frightfully prevalent, the people seem weak and emaciated, the cultivation is of a slovenly type, rice is the main crop, and turmeric the only staple to which any labour or pains are devoted.\n\nThe population is 20,370, of whom only 1,794 are Musalmans, and only 8,877 are females. The singular disproportion exists in all the Tar\u00e1i parganas, and is quite unaccountable. It is the most thinly populated of all the parganas in the district except Khairigarh, falling at the rate of only 146 to the square mile.\n\nHistory.\u2014The proprietors were originally Katehria Chhattirs, and a number of the villages are still in their possession, but all are deeply embarrassed. A number of Pah\u00e1ri Chhattirs, relatives of the R\u00e1ja of Khairigarh, were originally lessees under the R\u00e1ja of Khot\u00e1r, the head of the Katehria clan. At the first settlement for thirty years (in 1839) these and others, who have occupied a similar position, were declared to be proprietors by the British Government. Not however on any title, real or pretended, of their own, but simply because the pargana was a waste wilderness; over it the R\u00e1ja of Khot\u00e1r had exercised titular authority for some years. These lessees had exerted themselves, and spent money in cutting down the forest and inducing cultivators to settle in regions which were then unhealthy, and still more terrible to the people's minds as the haunts of numerous tigers and wild elephants. The Suheli river, with the swamps on each side, and the numerous ancient river channels above described, are still the haunts of numerous tigers. And we can judge how destructive they must have been in former times by the pertinacity with which they cling to old haunts, now the resort of a numerous population. Near Newalkh\u00e1r the forest department has its timber dep\u00f4ts and saw-mills; some famed tiger swamps are in the vicinity; notwithstanding the presence of armed men, the bullocks employed in carting the timber are constantly killed; numerous bands of sportsmen annually move against the tigers, and in 1870 several were shot by the Duke of Edinburgh.\n\nThe following extracts bearing on the condition of the people are taken from the assessment report:\n\n\"The circumstances of this pargana are very peculiar as appears from the history already given.\"\n\"The tenure of land is zamindari; there are no taluqas except fifteen villages, which were formerly in Khairigarh.\n\n\"The other landowners are relatives of the Katehria R\u00e1ja of Khot\u00e1r, or the descendants of the men who took farming leases from the Government in 1838, and who now have become proprietors. The land was nearly all waste at that time, and these men were engaged with as the representatives of the cultivating community; the terms of their engagement seem very favourable, and they naturally gave similarly good terms to the tenants whom they represented. The system of naqshi payment was introduced\u2014namely, that the tenant paid for each harvest, and if the crop was spoiled by flood, or destroyed by the forest denizens, the tenant paid nothing.\n\n\"The average rate paid by the as\u00e1mis is four annas per bigha rising to six in a few villages\u2014that is, from eight annas to twelve for the year; this becomes Re. 1-6 to Rs. 2-7 for the jarfibi bigha in dufasli land, and twelve annas to Re. 1-3-6 for ekfasli. The local bigha varies in size; it is in some places 2\u00bd to the jarfibi bigha, but the average is 3\u00bd among low caste as\u00e1mis. These rents, considering the quality of the soil, situation of the pargana between two navigable rivers, and density of the population, are absurdly low, and are due to the nature of the relation between the landlord and tenant, which really more resembled those between state lessee and shareholders.\n\n\"I have repeatedly met as\u00e1mis in the fields who admitted reaping a harvest of 8-7, and never less than 5 maunds rice per bigha, and who were paying four annas rent; now taking the average of above 6\u00bd kachcha maunds of 18 sers, the whole value of the crop at 39 sers would be Rs. 3, the lambardar's share at \u00a7ths would be Re. 1-1-3, and the Government share eight annas. I do not say that all land yields an average of 6\u00bd maunds; all I say is that land which admittedly does so, and which should pay rent of more than one rupee, pays only four annas, there being very little dufasli. In other villages the as\u00e1mis assured me that whenever the crop in unmanured land becomes less than five maunds of rice, they abandoned that land and dug up new.\n\n\"It is also clear that the rents are low, because the wealth of the pargana lies with the as\u00e1mis; their cattle, carts, jewellery, clothes, are infinitely superior to those in the old Oudh parganas. The lambardars, on the other hand, are very poor and embarrassed; they receive a very small margin, indeed, upon the Government jama: many of them have been sold out. It is abundantly evident that these rents are wholly abnormal, and cannot be used as a base for the rent rates of a thirty years' settlement, during which for the first time the lambardars, who were formerly only lessees, and fettered by Act X., will be able to treat their tenants as they please: because they themselves are at last formally recognized as proprietors, and the cultivators are now formally declared by the Oudh Rent Act to be tenants-at-will. Indeed, the lambardars have already commenced to exercise their new powers\u2014not by raising the old rents upon the old staples, but by imposing disproportionably high rates upon new staples.\"\n\"Turmeric, for instance, has either been introduced, or its cultivation largely extended since annexation; in most villages it grows everywhere and will on poor sandy soil. It pays one rupee to twenty annas per kachcha bigha; the as\u00e1mi grumbles; he says that only exceptional prices make it pay; but he holds on, making up such losses by his gain on cereals. Now there is absolutely no reason for this turmeric rate, five hundred per cent, above the grain rate.\n\n\"Turmeric has only one advantage, that is, that wild animals do not eat it, but really the danger from this to any crop is a mere trifle\u2014nothing to what occurs in Kukra, Mail\u00e1n\u00ed, Aurangabad, Srinagar, and other parganas. During three weeks' residence I only saw five nil-gae in the pargana. In Srinagar I have killed seven in a morning. Turmeric is a most difficult product to prepare, the expense of boiling down the roots is great, the value of the produce after deducting cost of preparation is by no means more than that of fair crops of rice, and I have no doubt that this now exceptional rate is really very little above what will prevail over the whole area, when the relation between the landlord and tenant have settled down. Precautions have been taken to protect any men who had acquired a right to hereditary tenancies before the inclusion of the pargana in Oudh, but hardly any have claimed. When I asked the landlords why rent was so low, I received complaints of as\u00e1mis, of cattle disease, and of unhealthiness; but in all these matters the pargana is far better than Khairigarh, where the tenants pay much higher rents, eight and ten annas the kachcha bigha.\"\n\nPALIA\u2014Pargana PALIA\u2014Tahsil NIGH\u00c1SAN\u2014District KHERI.\u2014A town from which a pargana derives its name in the district of Kheri, is situated two miles north of the Chauka river, and 112 miles north-west from Lucknow. Latitude 28\u00b026', longitude 80\u00b037'. There are two Hindu temples in Palia. It has a market twice a week, on Wednesdays and Saturdays. Articles of country consumption are sold. There is only one masonry well, and no masonry house; the place is very liable to fever, partly from the bad water; it belongs to a Kateria Chhattri. The place is of modern foundation.

Two miles south of it there is an unmetalled road between Unao and Rae Bareli districts through tahsil Purwa.\n\nIt is related regarding its foundation that two brothers, Borh\u00fa P\u00e1nde and Hari P\u00e1nde, Brahmans by caste, were in the service of R\u00e1ja Jai Chand, of Kanauj, and each of them laid the foundation of a village, naming it after himself by the permission of the raja. It is so called because it was founded by the elder brother. The soil is clay and sand and surface level; neighbouring country delightful. There is no jungle, but mango trees in\nabundance. The climate good, water sweet, but some wells are brackish. There is one temple of Sagreshwar Mah\u00e1deo here. There is now a school here numbering 75 pupils, of whom 71 are Hindus and four Muhammadans. There are two markets weekly, but no fair. Total population, 3,852.

Its greatest width is three miles and greatest length four miles, and the total area is 12,168 acres; and population, according to census of 1869 A.D., 7,997 souls.\n\n| Caste       | Number |\n|-------------|--------|\n| Hindus      | 7,769  |\n| Muhammadans | 218    |\n\nThe cultivated area bears but a small proportion to the total area, being only 5,281 acres; but is well irrigated; the irrigated area being 4,227 acres and the unirrigated area 1,054 acres. The land devoted to cultivation of rabi crops is about double of that devoted to kharif. The pargana comprises 23 mauzas (townships), of which 9 are taluqdari and 14 mufrad. Of the taluqdari mauzas (villages) none are held by under-proprietors. The nik\u00e1si kh\u00e1m (gross rental) is at present Rs. 27,629, and of this Government takes Rs. 16,809.\n\nThe surface of the pargana presents no striking features, and is a level plain except at the extreme south, where there is a slight inclination to the bed of the river Lon. There are no jungles, and but few groves throughout the pargana, but babul trees grow plentifully along the line of villages near the Lon on a tract of land where formerly salt was extensively manufactured. This trade has, however, disappeared as a private enterprise under British rule. The Lon indicates by its name that the land through which it passes is highly impregnated with salt. It flows from west to east passing the villages of K\u00e1kori, Baijuamau, M\u00edrwan, Parsanda, Dainta, Bhagwantpur, and Biy\u00e1sipur. The stream scarcely deserves the name of river. The flow of water is but scant when greatest, and the bed of the stream is completely dry in many places in the hot weather. On the Rae\n\n* By Mr. W. Hoey, C.S., Assistant Commissioner.\nBareli side of the pargana and lying between the villages on the east of this pargana, and the nearest villages of Rae Bareli, is a very large jhil, named the Sudna T\u00e1l\u00e1b. The shape of this sheet of water is a horse-shoe, the convex side being towards Panhan. This tank is one of the largest in this and the adjoining pargana on the Rae Bareli side. It is well stocked with saur, parhan, sahri, and other fish.\n\nThe history of this pargana is meagre. The earliest known occupants were the Bhars, one of whose rajas is said to have borne the name of Pann, and to have built the town of Panhan, giving it his name. The remains of an old fort are discernible in the vicinity of the village of Panhan, and are said to be the remains of the ancient Bhar stronghold. About 1,600 years ago S\u00e1liv\u00e1han came with his army to Sh\u00edr\u00e1jpur in the modern district of Fatehpur, and halted there to bathe in the Ganges. Abhai Chand Bais and his brother, Pirth\u00ed Chand, were with S\u00e1liv\u00e1han. The former advanced and crossed the Ganges, attacked the Bhars, and defeated them at Panhan. Abhai Chand added other dominions to his conquest, and Panhan formed part of the large domain known as Baisw\u00e1ra.\n\n**PANHAN Village\u2014Pargana PANHAN\u2014Tahsil PURWA\u2014District UNAO.**\n\n\u2014Panhan lies 24 miles south of Unao on the country road from Unao to Rae Bareli. The river Lon runs two miles to the north. The town was founded 2,200 years ago by the R\u00e1ja Pann, chief of the Bhars, from whom it derived its name. It is well situated among groves, good water, and fertile soil. A celebrated faq\u00edr named Muhammad Shah resided here. There is a vernacular school attended by about 50 boys. Fairs are held in January and March in honour of Muhammad Shah, each attended by about 4,000 people. Sweetmeats made at this place are remarkable. Population is 2,773, of whom 800 are Brahmans and 130 Musalmans. There are two temples to Mah\u00e1deo and one to Debi. The sales at the fairs amount to Rs. 24,000 annually.\n\n| Latitude | ... | ... | 26\u00b025' north. |\n|----------|-----|-----|---------------|\n| Longitude| ... | ... | 80\u00b054' east. |\n\n**PAR\u00c1SPUR \u00c1TA*\u2014Pargana GUW\u00c1RICH\u2014Tahsil BEGAMGANJ\u2014District GONDA.**\n\n\u2014A very large straggling village in the Guw\u00e1r\u00edch pargana on the country road between Nawabganj and Colonelganj, 26 miles from the former, and 10 from the latter market, and 15 miles south-west of Gonda. Adjoining, and in fact making one village with it is Ata, and the joint population is returned at 7,107. It is almost entirely Hindu, and contains no remarkable castes or religions; on the boundary of the two villages is a flourishing school where rather over a hundred boys imbibe instruction in Hindi, Urdu, arithmetic, and the elements of algebra and euclid. The houses are almost without exception of mud, and in Par\u00e1sipur itself is a small bazar, open twice a week for the wants of the neighbouring rustics, and acting as a d\u00e9p\u00f4t for as much of the export produce of the surrounding villages as does not find its way to one of the larger bazars. The town was founded nearly 400 years ago by R\u00e1ja Paras R\u00e1m Kalhans, the only surviving son of the ill-starred chieftain whose destruction by the\n\n* By Mr. W. C. Bennett, C.S., Assistant Commissioner.\nGogra wave has been recounted in the district article. His descendant, the present R\u00e1ja of Par\u00e1spur, and chief of the Kalhans of Guw\u00e1r\u00edch, still resides in a large mud-house to the east of the village. The B\u00e1bu of \u00c1ta, representative of a younger branch, and with a separate estate, lives in \u00c1ta, a name accounted for by the following curious legend. B\u00e1bu L\u00e1l S\u00e1h, the first of his branch of the family was out hunting near Par\u00e1spur, he met a faq\u00edr eating what appeared to be carrion. The holy man pressed him to join, and his repugnance yielded to hunger and a dread of the curse which was promised to his refusal. To his surprise it turned out to be excellent wheat flour (\u00c1ta), and at the faq\u00edr's bidding a pot full of the deceptive flesh was buried under the doorway of the fort which L\u00e1l S\u00e1h was building.\n\nPARASR\u00c1MPUR.\u2014Pargana PATTI\u2014Tahsil PATTI\u2014District PARTABGARH. This place was founded by Parasr\u00e1m, a Gosh\u00e1\u00edn. The road from Bela to B\u00e1dsh\u00e1hpur passes a mile from this village. It is six miles from Bela and close to the river Sai. There is alleged to have been a fort here belonging to Madan Singh Bais, a subject of the great Gahilwar R\u00e1ja Manik Chand; he revolted. \u00c1lha and \u00dadal were sent against him; the R\u00e1ja seized and imprisoned them; but their wives Sona and Blola raised a force, conquered the R\u00e1ja, and released them. There is a temple of Chauh\u00e1rja Debi here, at which cocks and pigs are sacrificed. There is a fair in honour of Chauh\u00e1rja Debi at which about 6,000 people assemble. Population 329.\n\nPARIAR Pargana.\u2014Tahsil UNAO\u2014District UNAO.\u2014This pargana is bounded on the north by Safipur, on the east by pargana Unao, on the south by Sikandarpur, and on the west by the Ganges, which separates it from the Cawnpore district of the North-Western Provinces. The pargana is nine miles long by five broad, and its area is 36 square miles or 23,040 acres, divided into 42 mauzas or townships. The soil is chiefly loam and clay, and the pargana produces wheat and barley of the first quality. The principal stream is the Kaly\u00e1ni, which falls into the Ganges. Water is found 32 feet from the surface. There are many acres of groves, chiefly of mahua and mango. There are three bazars. Salt earth is to be found in small quantities. There are two lakes in the pargana, viz., Mahna, beside the village of Pariar, which is about two miles long and half a mile broad, and Bhedeona, in the village of the same name, about a mile square. The principal village is Pariar on the Ganges, which is held sacred by the Hindus, and is separately noticed. The land revenue amounts to Rs. 29,408, which gives an assessment of Re. 1-4-6 per acre.\n\nThe tenure is as follows:\n\n| Taluqdari | ... | ... | ... | 1,529 acres. |\n|-----------|-----|-----|-----|-------------|\n| Zam\u00edndari | ... | ... | ... | 13,576 \"   |\n| Patt\u00eddari | ... | ... | ... | 7,759 \"    |\n\nThe population is 15,717, of whom 8,173 are males. The people are poor, and, as a rule, involved in debt. The principal fair is that held on the K\u00e1rt\u00edki P\u00faranm\u00e1shi at which 100,000 people assemble.\nTradition relates that there was formerly a jungle here. In the Treta Yog, or second age of the world, Lachhman, by order of his brother R\u00e1ja R\u00e1m Chandar, of Ajodhya, turned out R\u00e1ni S\u00edta on this land; hence the name of the pargana from the Sanskrit word \"Parhar,\" to turn out, or let go\u2014i.e., divorce\u2014afterwards corrupted into Pariar. In 595 A.H. (1187 A.D.), Hewanchal Singh, a Dikhit Th\u00e1kur, came here with an army from the north, conquered the Lonias, then zamindars of the pargana, and founded the village of Pariar. In 1785 A.D., 28 villages were taken from Sikandarpur and Safipur and formed as pargana Pariar.\n\nPARIAR\u2014Pargana PARIAR\u2014Tahsil UNAO\u2014District UNAO.\u2014Lies in Latitude 26\u00b044' north, longitude 80\u00b022' east to the north-west of Unao, at the distance of 14 miles. An unmetalled road connects it with Ras\u00falabad. The river Ganges runs past the village towards the south. There is a lake by name Mahna near this village. The origin of the name is given in the pargana article. R\u00fap Singh, B\u00e1chhil, was a man of note here in the time of Mi\u00e1n Alm\u00e1s \u00c1li Khan. He built a fort and a ganj or walled bazar at this place. A tahsildar resided here during the Nawabi. There is one general market, and a cloth market twice a week in Daulatganj. There is now no sar\u00e1e, th\u00e1na, or tahsil. There is no jungle near. The climate is good. The population amounts to 2,593, of whom Brahmans are as many as 638, and Musalmans only 117. There is a great bathing fair on the K\u00e1rt\u00edki Pur\u00e1n-m\u00e1shi, attended by 100,000 souls. The market and fair realize about 1,522 rupees only. There are 589 mud-built houses and two masonry. There are six Hindu temples.\n\nTradition relates, when R\u00e1ja R\u00e1m Chandar was performing the sacrifice called Ashwamed Jagg, he loosed the horse Shy\u00e1mbaran, and announced that whoever caught it would thereby signify a wish to make war with him. Kus and Lav, the sons of the raja himself, seized the horse in the jungle of Pariar, and thereupon a great fight ensued. In a temple at Pariar there are to be seen up till the present time a number of arrow heads said to have been used by the contending parties, and they are also sometimes picked up in the bed of the river. There is a temple in honour of Sr\u00ed B\u00e1lkaneswar N\u00e1th Mah\u00e1deo on the Ganges built by Lav and Kus, and one to J\u00e1nkiji or R\u00e1ni S\u00edta.\n\nPARSANDAN\u2014Pargana Gorinda PARSANDAN\u2014Tahsil MOH\u00c1N\u2014District UNAO.\u2014Parsandan is 12 miles south of Jhalotar Ajgain and 14 north-east of Unao. In the king's time it was headquarters of the pargana of the same name, but since the establishment of British rule Parsandan has been joined to pargana Gorinda, and made a part of tahsil Moh\u00e1n. A metalled road from Lucknow to Cawnpore passes through this part of the country. There is nothing certain known about the date and circumstances connected with its foundation. It is said that in early days there was a dense jungle in the vicinity, and the heroic Paras R\u00e1m, the sixth incarnation of the deity, performed his penances here; date unknown. There were some traces of his place of worship left which induced R\u00e1ja Ugrasen to come from the other side of the Jumna, and he cleared the jungle, and founded the present town. It is supposed to have taken its\nname from having been the residence of Paras R\u00e1m. The soil is principally clay. There is a pleasing variety of hill and hollow round this town. There is no jungle. Climate healthy and water good. Some 500 years ago there was a great contest between Himmat Singh, ancestor of the present possessors, and the Subahdar of the king of Delhi. There are still ruins of an old fort built by Himmat Singh.

In her tenure Parsh\u00e1depur and Ateha were constituted as parganas. Another account gives Sikandarpur as the old name of this pargana, and Pars, a Bhar chief, is said to have called it Parsh\u00e1depur. The Bhars were driven from here as from other places by Muhammadans, whose traces are found in the names of villages as Rash\u00eddpur, Moh\u00ed-ud-d\u00ednpur, and Dil\u00e1waripur, &c. The Path\u00e1s were ejected through the instrumentality of a Kurmi, named D\u00e1s\u00ed, who it is said became a Moslem, and gaining influence at the court of Delhi, acquired a grant of the pargana. D\u00e1s\u00ed was himself killed and succeeded by some Gautam Rajputs, who are still in the pargana represented by Ra\u00e9 Mahip\u00e1l Singh, Taluqdar of B\u00e1ra, and other owners of six independent villages.\nThe place, Parsh\u00e1depur, is really the mingled village sites of some four villages\u2014viz., R\u00e1mpur, Ahora, Launsari, Songna, and Shah\u00e1bpur. There is no village called Parsh\u00e1depur. A force used to be quartered there under the native government of Oudh. When the country was annexed Salon was the name given to a district, and the headquarters were placed at Kashw\u00e1pur in this pargana on the bank of the river Sai. Upon the mutiny breaking out the civil officers went to R\u00e1ja Hanwant Singh\u2019s fort of K\u00e1lak\u00e1nkar, and thence to Allahabad. The N\u00e1in taluqdars, true to their character of pestilent marauders, signalised themselves by seizing the earliest opportunity in the mutiny to plunder right and left.\n\nPARSH\u00c1DEPUR\u2014Pargana PARSH\u00c1DEPUR\u2014Tahsil SALON\u2014District RAEBARELI.\u2014This place was founded by a Bhar chief, R\u00e1ja Pars, on the road to Salon. The river Sai flows a mile to the south; it is twenty miles from Rae Bareli. It is alleged that the name of this place was Sikandarpur in ancient days. The population is 4,319, of whom the Hindus are 2,645 and Musalmans 1,674. There are 48 masonry houses, five temples to Mah\u00e1deo, six mosques, three im\u00e1mb\u00e1ras, and one vernacular school. There is a baz\u00e1r called Khud\u00e1ganj; the annual sales amount to Rs. 5,000.\n\nPARTABGANJ Pargana\u2014Tahsil NAWABGANJ\u2014District BARA BANKI.\u2014This pargana is bounded on the north by villages of the Fatehpur tahsil, on the east by villages of the R\u00e1m Sanehi Ghat tahsil, on the south by pargana Satrikh, and on the west by pargana Nawabganj. Its area is fifty-six square miles or 35,751 acres. The cultivated soil amounts to 24,288 acres, the culturable to 3,776 acres, and the barren to 6,339 acres. The irrigated area amounts to 10,212 acres and the unirrigated to 15,206. The Kaly\u00e1ni skirts the pargana on the north and east. Its length within the limits of the pargana is about six miles. This stream does neither good nor harm. Water is met with at from six to twelve feet. The metallad road to Fyzabad passes through this pargana. There are no manufactures of any note. The land revenue amounts to Rs. 64,293-1-6, falling at the rate of Rs. 2-5-1 per arable acre. The fifty-four villages of this pargana are held under the following tenures:\n\n| Taluqdari | Zamindari | Pattidari |\n|-----------|-----------|----------|\n|           |           |          |\n|           |           |          |\n\nTotal 54\n\nThe pargana is held by Rajas Sarabj\u00edt Singh and Farzand Ali Khan, Chaudhr\u00e1in Sahib-un-nisa, Hak\u00edm Karam Ali, W\u00e1jid Husen, Ghul\u00e1m Abb\u00e1s, N\u00e1ipal Singh, and Amjad Husen.

Schools have been established at Partabganj, Safdarganj, Rasauli, Udhauli, and M\u00e1lpur. There is a post-office at Safdarganj. Police posts are at Jal\u00e1lpur and Maktaura. There is no registry office. A fair held at the end of \u00c1s\u00e1dh, in honour of N\u00e1g Deota, at mauza Machhad, is attended by about 11,000 persons; milk and rice are offered. The pargana takes its name from the principal\ntown. In the village of Pindra a battle was fought between the king's men and the Mahmudabad taluqdar.\n\nPARTABGANJ\u2014Pargana PARTABGANJ\u2014Tahsil NAWABGANJ\u2014District BARA BANKI.\u2014This market town lies in latitude 26\u00b055' north, longitude 81\u00b020' east, at a distance of five miles east of Nawabganj on the Fyzabad road. It was founded on the land of Rasauli village by Rae Partab Singh, a royal official, about 150 years ago. The market days are Mondays and Fridays. This ganj was very prosperous during the Nawabi, but now it presents the aspect of decay. There are two large jhils close to the village which in the season are covered with ducks, &c.\n\nDh\u00e1n Singh, a banker, built a masonry tank and wells here during the Nawabi. Since then M\u00e1t\u00e1d\u00edn, Halw\u00e1i, has constructed a masonry tank on the road side at a cost of Rs. 10,000. There is a branch school at this place.\nPARTABGARH DISTRICT ARTICLE.\n\nABSTRACT OF CHAPTERS.\n\nI.\u2014PHYSICAL FEATURES. II.\u2014AGRICULTURE AND COMMERCE. III.\u2014THE PEOPLE.

The area is 1,444 square miles, the population 7,82,681 souls. It is at an average altitude of 300 feet above the sea. There are no mountains.\n\nBoundaries.\u2014It is bounded on the north by the conterminous district of Sultanpur, of which the adjoining parganas running from west to east are Amethi, Tappa Asl, and Chanda, on the west by the parganas of Salon and Parshadepur of Rae Bareli. The Ganges running south-east and dividing Oudh from the Allahabad district of the North-Western Provinces, is the boundary of the district as far as the village of Jah\u00e1nabad. This adjoins the village of Kadwa in the Allahabad district. Here the boundary line takes a north-east direction, and runs up very irregularly to the Gumti river, conterminously with the Allahabad and the Jaunpur districts of the North-Western Provinces. The Gumti, across which lies the Alde-mau pargana of Sultanpur, forms the boundary for four miles only.\n\nThus the district adjoins the districts of Sultanpur and Rae Bareli in Oudh, Fatehpur, Allahabad, and Jaunpur in the North-Western Provinces; its area, internal divisions, and population are shown in the accompanying table.\n\n| Parganas | No. of villages or townships | AREA IN BRITISH SQUARE MILES | POPULATION |\n|----------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|\n|          |                             |                             |            |\n|          |                             |                             |            |\n|          |                             |                             |            |\n|          |                             |                             |            |\n|          |                             |                             |            |\n|          |                             |                             |            |\n\nTotal... 708 494 283 241,180 28,290 184,651 139,769 364,420 609\n\nNo. of persons to each square mile... 619\nThis statement is taken from the census report, and does not quite agree with later calculations, the details of which are not procurable.\n\nThe present district of Partabgarh then contains three tahsils and seven parganas. Up to 1869 the district contained nine parganas\u2014namely, Salon and Parsh\u00e1depur\u2014in addition to those in the foregoing table. The area in acres was 11,09,072.\n\nCorrection in area.\u2014This total of acres gives a superficial area of 1732\u00b78, or in round numbers 1733 square miles, showing an increase of nine square miles over the area given by the settlement survey. The error in that calculation being the result of the omission of the areas of the jungle grant estates which were surveyed by the revenue surveyor, but were not mapped by the field survey establishment. The jungle grants, as they are styled in the records, lie in parganas Partabgarh and Salon only. They constitute twenty-eight mauzas, of which twenty-three belong to the latter pargana and five to the former. All these small estates were formed almost entirely out of waste lands appertaining to certain villages confiscated in 1859. The cultivated areas having been conferred in reward on various loyal subjects, the uncultivated portion was stripped from the villages, and reserved for the purpose of waste land grants.\n\nUnder the recent territorial re-distribution of the fiscal divisions of Oudh, the Partabgarh district has been deprived of one of its four tahsils, the two parganas of Salon and Parsh\u00e1depur having been transferred to the adjoining district of Rae Bareli, and the Ateha pargana (which with the other two made up the Salon tahsil) having been added on to the Kunda tahsil. By the loss of these two parganas the area of the district is diminished by 280 square miles and 347 mauzas; the former population was 936,053.\n\nPresent jurisdiction of the Deputy Commissioner of Partabgarh.\u2014The present jurisdiction, therefore, of the Deputy Commissioner of Partabgarh\nextends over an area of 1,444 square miles, embracing 2,214 mauzas, with a population of 782,681 souls. In point of magnitude the Partabgarh district now stands eleventh of the twelve.\n\nGeneral aspect.\u2014The general aspect of the Partabgarh district is that of a richly wooded and fertile campaign country. The ordinary dead level is here and there relieved by gentle undulations, and in the vicinity of the rivers and rain streams by ravines and broken ground. The southern portion of the district in the more immediate neighbourhood of the Ganges is perhaps more densely wooded than other parts. In places may be seen unculturable \u00fbsar and reh impregnated plains. These, however, do not extend over any considerable area. For the most part rich and varied cultivation, with magnificent groves of mango, mahua, and other trees combine to form a pleasing landscape, into which the neatly built villages and hamlets of the population enter with no small effect.\n\nSoil.\u2014The soil of the district is light, but at the same time very fertile. The prevailing soil is known by the name of \"dumat\"\u2014i.e., two earths. It may be said to be argil and silica in thorough combination. Dumat degenerates into the poor sterile stuff known as \"bh\u00fbr,\" where the sand too largely preponderates over the mould. Such localities are the uplands near the Ganges, Sai, and Gumti. The stiff and rich loamy soil, styled \"mat\u00eer,\" is in this district to be found, chiefly in the vicinity of large swamps or jh\u00fbls. In such places, where there is a sufficiently rapid evaporation of the rain water, magnificent crops of wheat and sugarcane may frequently be seen; but, unlike the ordinary soil of the district, considerable labour and strong cattle are required to prepare the land for the seed.\n\nFertility.\u2014The soil, though fertile, bears evidence of exhaustion through want of manure and fallow seasons. The latter condition has, I fear, ceased to be regarded as an essential to successful farming by the agriculturist of this district. The root of the existing complaint, that the present yield is not equal to that of former times, lies in the fact that, under the native rule, a field was seldom tilled for more than two or three years in succession. In the third or fourth year, a plot of waste was broken up (on which a nominal rent only was assessed), while the old land was allowed to lie fallow. A succession of rich harvests was the consequence. Now, however, owing to the greatly increased number of the cultivators, and the proportionately enhanced demand for land, caused by the closing to the country of the outlets of military service, feudal retainership, and the many other occupations incidental to the native dynasty, competition steps in and prevents the resting of a single acre. With respect to manure, I think a growing appreciation of its value is discernible; at the same time it is far more difficult to procure than formerly.\n\nWater.\u2014The water obtained from the wells is for the most part sweet and good. In several villages, however, it is found to be brackish and strongly impregnated with the saline properties of the circumjacent saliferous lands. It is in these villages that the finest and most luxuriant tobacco is grown, generally on old village sites. It is asserted, and I believe not without truth, that in certain wells in which the water is ordin-\narilly sweet, a change is sometimes perceptible, the water for a season becoming brackish, but subsequently resuming its normal condition. This may possibly be attributable to subsoil percolation, after the absorption of large quantities of surface moisture; but the solution of the problem, if problem there be, is worthy the attention of the analyst.\n\nWater supply.\u2014Abundance of water, both for irrigation and domestic purposes, exists as a rule throughout the district. The exceptions are ordinarily in localities bordering on the banks of rivers and n\u00e1las, where, owing to the sandy nature of the subsoil, mud wells are found to be impracticable, and the building of masonry wells is attended with considerably greater expense than elsewhere. There are no less than 9,947 masonry wells in working order at the present time, of which 3,146 have been constructed since the annexation of the province. This represents an average of between three and four wells to each village in the district. Mud wells are innumerable, and are sunk annually as required, the cost being trifling. The average depth at which water trickles is 25 feet. The range of distance varies from 11 to 80 feet.\n\nClimate, temperature.\u2014The climate of the Partabgarh district is comparatively temperate, and is decidedly salubrious. The maximum heat in the hottest months is less, I believe, than that experienced in the adjacent district of Allahabad to the south of the Ganges; while the climate of the cold season, which ordinarily extends from the 15th October to the 15th March, can hardly be said to be surpassed by any climate in Europe.\n\nThe readings of the thermometer in 1869 shows a mean range of 29\u00b77 degrees, and for the following year, 1870, a mean range of 30\u00b71 degrees. Taking both years together, the maximum range was 43 degrees in April, 1870, and the minimum range 17 degrees in August, 1870, the same year exhibiting both extremes.\n\nRainfall.\u2014The average for 1864-1868 inclusive was 36 inches; the average of the twelve years ending with October 1st, 1875, has been 37\u00b73 inches; three years have shown drought, 1864, 1868, and 1873; three have shown excessive rainfall; only two have had the moderate rainfall, 35 to 46 inches, which when properly distributed generally results in a bumper crop.\n\n| Years | Inches |\n|-------|--------|\n| 1864  | 36\u00b70   |\n| 1865  | 30\u00b70   |\n| 1866  | 35\u00b70   |\n| 1867  | 52\u00b71   |\n| 1868  | 36\u00b70   |\n| 1869  | 44\u00b71   |\n| 1870  | 58\u00b78   |\n| 1871  | 59\u00b70   |\n| 1872  | 29\u00b71   |\n| 1873  | 26\u00b70   |\n| 1874  | 33\u00b72   |\n| 1875  | 36\u00b70   |\n\nAverage for 12 years 37\u00b73\n\n*Circa.*\nThe accompanying table exhibits the rainfall for the last two years of drought, 1868 and 1873. It will be noted that the entire rainfall was not scanty; the distribution was capricious and unusual, and there was no rain during the individual months, in which it is much needed for agricultural purposes. There are four rainfalls, each of which must be propitious to secure a good harvest. First, the June rains, the former rains as they may be called: In 1873, there was under a quarter of an inch, not enough to moisten the earth for the plough and to water the early rice. Second, the main monsoon, which commences in July and ends at the beginning of October. This was sufficient in both years, but the fall in September, 1873, was only 6\u00b76 inches, and it ceased too soon\u2014viz., on September 15th. Thirdly, the latter or October rains, which are required to water the late rice, and moisten the land for the winter ploughings; these were wholly deficient in both years. Fourthly, the January-February rains, which were wholly wanting in 1869, and in 1874 were under half an inch.\n\nSpeaking broadly, then the rains commenced well in 1868, badly in 1873. They ended with a good fall in 1868, but too soon: in 1873 they were scanty for the last month, and ended still earlier in September. So far 1873 was much worse than 1868; then there was absolutely no rain in either year from October till January. In February, there was no rain in 1869, and not quite half an inch in 1874:\n\n| Rainfall from June 1st to October 1st | 29\u00b74 | 28\u00b77 |\n|-------------------------------------|------|------|\n| \" from October 1st to December 31st | 0\u00b70  | 0\u00b70  |\n| \" in June                           | 3\u00b72  | 0\u00b72  |\n| \" in September                      | 9\u00b77  | 6\u00b76  |\n| \" in October                        | 0\u00b70  | 0\u00b70  |\n| Date of rain commencing             | June 15th | June 21st |\n| of rain ending                      | September 23rd | Sept. 13th |\n| Rain in January-February of ensuing year | 0\u00b70  | 0\u00b74  |\n\nNatural drainage.\u2014The large admixture of sand in the soil of this district favours a rapid absorption of moisture. At the same time, a large share of the superabundant water is carried off by rain-streams, some of which, when swollen, assume formidable dimensions, and acquire a very considerable velocity. Thus the district may be said to possess an excellent natural drainage, which no doubt exerts a highly favourable influence on its general salubrity.\n\nPrevalent diseases.\u2014Of purely endemic diseases, intermittent fever, skin diseases, and ophthalmia are perhaps the most common. In the cold season of 1868-1869, the district suffered from an epidemic of small-pox, which was immediately followed by a severe and general outbreak of cholera. These epidemics, if they did not originate in, were doubtless rendered more virulent by, the death and distress, which resulted from the total failure of the autumn harvest of 1868, and the partial failure of the spring crops of 1869. The intermittent fever above alluded to is most prevalent at the close of the rainy season, and generally disappears with the thoroughly cool weather and westerly winds of November. While attributable to malaria, the disease is doubtless kept alive by debi-\nlitating influences, such as a trying exposure to alternate cold, damp and hot sun; the constitutions of the poorer classes being at that season un-\nsided by sufficiently stimulating nourishment.\n\nVegetation.\u2014There is no lack of vegetation in this part of the country. Trees, both large and small, low brushwood and grasses abound. The fine umbrageous groves of the mango and mahua in this and the adjoin-\ning districts, often the growth of centuries, cannot fail to impress the traveller with admiration. It was at one time apprehended that these old trees were in many places falling under the axe, without at the same time any attempt being made to replace them by fresh plantations. This led to the subject being taken up by district and settlement officers. The result of my enquiries in this district, extending over nearly three years, is highly re-assuring. The wooded area, so far from being dimin-\nished, is gradually extending.\n\nThe mango (Magnifera Indica).\u2014Of cultivated trees the mango largely preponderates. In the Kunda tahsil and the Ateha pargana mahua groves are numerous; but in the remainder of the district it is the exception to meet with a grove of any other tree but the mango. It is largely planted by all, and has hitherto been most religiously preserved by the Hindus. It is one of the five trees, which they are taught to regard as sacred. They are brought up to consider as a meritorious act the planting of a mango, but the cutting down or destruction of it as a species of sacrilege. This feeling is, however, losing force amongst them; several instances having recently come under my notice of high caste Hindus felling their mango trees, and selling the timber. The sale of mango groves also is far more common than it was a short time ago. Nevertheless, the propagation con-\ntinues to outstrip the destructive agency; and as the operation of the latter is very gradual, no very appreciable difference as regards the removal of the older trees will be apparent. The wood of the mango is of a light colour and soft. It is largely used for building and for fuel. It is also employed for a variety of common purposes. In building, the wood of the mahua is, however, greatly preferred by those who can afford it, being more lasting both in respect to the ravages of insects and the action of wet. The fruit of the mango ripens in May, and is in season until September. It is extensively consumed by all classes, and is so abundant as to be within the reach of the poorest. As a further instance of the gradual change of ideas in the Hindus of the present day, I may mention that the fruit of the mango, the sale of which was formerly almost unknown, has now become a regular market commodity. Zamindars and taluqdars alike, many of them no longer entertain the slightest repugnance to turn their orchard produce into money.\n\nThe mahua (Bassia latifolia).\u2014As previously stated, the mahua is principally found in the western half of the district. The flower withers in March and April and drops from the tree during the night. It is then collected and carried away in baskets. Of this tree Mr. King writes:\u2014\"There are found to be in the four tahsils the large number of 434,570 mahua trees. These represent a valuable pro-\nperty, and as, save in very exceptional instances, I have not assumed them as an asset of revenue, I look on them as a considerable resource in bad years and other times, upon which the m\u00e1lguz\u00e1r can fall back. If we assume every tree to produce twenty 'sers' of dried flower, this, at the price at which mahua has sold for the last four years\u2014viz., 1\u00bd maunds per rupee\u2014would represent a sum of Rs. 1,44,856. It is largely used for the distillation of spirit, and, when plentiful, is given to cattle. As a rule, the mahua crop is not good save once in three years. The seed of the mahua (which succeeds the flower from which the spirit is made), is extensively used for the manufacture of oil for burning; and the failure of the mahua crop is usually followed by a high price of oil throughout the year in which the failure occurs.\"\n\nThe tamarind (Tamarindus Indica) and other trees.\u2014That most graceful and beautiful tree, the tamarind, is everywhere common, together with the shisham (Dalbergia sissoo), the tun (Cedrela toona), siras (Acacia speciosa), j\u00e1mun (Eugenia jambolana), g\u00falar (Ficus racemosa), and n\u00edm (Azadirachta Indica). It is dotted about throughout the groves of the district. The wood of the tamarind is used for fuel only. The j\u00e1mun and g\u00falar come in most usefully in the construction of the \"niw\u00e1r\" or wooden supports of masonry wells. The wood of the shisham and tun are expensive, and are only accessible to the wealthy few. The latter is highly esteemed for furniture, and the former in the manufacture of bullock carriages, or \"bahals\" as they are called. The n\u00edm is prized for its medicinal properties. Its seeds yield an oil which is used chiefly as a therapeutic, although the poorer classes burn it in their houses. The disagreeable odour it emits is its principal drawback. The wood of the n\u00edm is somewhat soft, but enters largely into the manufacture of small articles of domestic use. Who has not heard of the \"n\u00edm-ka-misw\u00e1k\"* or famous native tooth-brush, which is said to exert so beneficial an effect on the enamel of the Indian ivory? From the older trees there exudes at times large quantities of sap of exceedingly bitter taste. This is carefully collected by the people, and is used as a tonic in cases of boils and other skin eruptions.\n\nThe kathal or jack fruit tree (Artocarpus integrifolia) and other fruit trees.\u2014The kathal or jack fruit tree occupies a high rank in the estimation of the people. The fruit is much sought after, and in the season the price varies, according to the size, from two pice to one rupee each. Other fruit-bearing trees\u2014such as the barhal (Artocarpus lakoochay), shaht\u00fat or mulberry (Morus Indica), bel (Egle marmelos), karaunda (Curissa cardenas), and \u00e1mla, or as it is commonly pronounced aonla \u2020 (Phyllanthus emblica)\u2014are all more or less common; while the orange, lemon, guava, pomegranate, and other finer fruits, find a place only in the gardens of the wealthier zamindars and residents in large towns.\n\n* Mr. Elliott, in his chronicles of Oonao, mentions a curious circumstance in connection with this subject\u2014viz., that the Rajkwar is alone of all Rajput clans forbidden the use of the n\u00edm tooth-brush.\n\n\u2020 Also called Phyllanthus emblica, of the natural order Euphorbiaceae.\nTrees of wild and indigenous growth.\u2014Of purely indigenous trees, the pipal* (Ficus religiosa), bargad (Ficus Indica), p\u0101kar (Ficus vinoso), amilt\u0101s (Cassia fistula), chilbil (Ulmus integrifolia), kachn\u0101r (Bauhinia), bakain (Melia azedarach), sahijna or horse-radish tree (Moringa pterygosperma), sihor, of stunted growth (Trophis aspera), are perhaps the most conspicuous. The wood of the pipal is chiefly used as fuel in brick-kilns. The resin or gum, which exudes from the bark, is collected and manufactured into the \"churis\" or bracelets worn by native women. Elephants, camels, and other animals browse on the leaves of the pipal and bargad. The glutinous substance found inside the seed-pod of the amilt\u0101s is a very old and much valued medicine in the hakim's pharmacopoea. The chilbil yields a white pretty looking wood, which is sometimes used for making plough bullock-yokes; but it is fragile, and in consequence but little esteemed. The kachn\u0101r, when in full blossom, affords a beautiful spectacle, while the flowers emit a fragrance which is almost overpowering. The natives pluck the buds just before they burst into flower, and eat them either raw or prepared as a condiment. The bakain and sahijna call for no particular remark beyond that they are exceedingly ornamental trees. The leaves of the sihor are consumed by the cattle, who regularly strip off the smaller branches, and thus no doubt cause the tree to bear that close-cropped stunted appearance which it does.\n\nDh\u0101k (Butea frondosa) and r\u016bs (Adhatoda vasica) brushwood.\u2014The small patches of jungle which are now left in this district are principally composed of dh\u0101k and r\u016bs brushwood, interspersed with the thorny makoe (Solanum nigrum), dehra, wild karaunda, and sihor. Around most of the old forts of the taluqdars, these thorn bushes were grown so thickly as often to form a dense and impenetrable thicket for several hundreds of yards. The dh\u0101k sometimes shoots up into a large tree. I recently came across one which was not less than 40 feet high. The root of the dh\u0101k, or \"chheol\" as it is also called, furnishes a coarse fibre, wherewith ropes are manufactured. Buffaloes are fed on the leaves. The r\u016bs is extensively employed in the construction of the fascine-like supports of mud wells. The smaller branches are exceedingly pliant, and are worked round and round in a sort of neat triple plait. The leaf is held to possess high qualities as a manure, and is scattered over the fields just before the rainy season commences. It is then worked into the soil with the plough, and left to decay with the moisture, and form mould. As fuel it is almost exclusively used in the process of boiling down the cane juice, and is collected into large heaps some days prior to the cutting down of the sugarcane.\n\nThe bamboo (Bambusa arundinacea).\u2014The bamboo, though to be met with in abundance in this district, can hardly I think be said to be\n\n---\n\n* In his chronicles of Oomoo, Mr C. A. Elliott, C.S., writes:\u2014\"There are five sacred trees among the Hindus\u2014the 'pipal,' the 'g\u016blar,' 'bargad,' 'p\u0101kar,' and mango. Of these the 'pipal' is far the most reverenced. A good Hindoo, who on a journey sees a 'pipal' tree on his road, will take off his shoes and walk round it from right to left (pardachua), and repeat this verse\u2014\n\n\"M\u016ble Br\u0101hma, tuche Bishan, S\u0113kha R\u016bdr Mahesh\u016bran, sir madhe basat Ganga, p\u0101tre p\u0101tre Dev\u0101n\u0101m, Brichh R\u0101j namastute.\n\n\"The roots are Br\u0101hma, the bark Vish\u016bn, the branches are the Mah\u0101deos.\n\n\"In the bark lives the Ganges, the leaves are the minor deities.\n\n\"Hail to thee, king of trees!\"\nindigenous to it. In the northern parts of the province it forms, I believe, extensive jungles. It is one of the most ornamental, as it is one of the most highly prized natural products of the country. To attempt to detail its various uses would be tedious. For thatching purposes, for boughy poles, in the manufacture of umbrellas and baskets, and for many other common purposes, it possesses a special value.\n\nThe wild aloe (Aloe spicata) (Agave, vivipara).\u2014The khetki or \"h\u00e1thi ching\u00e1r,\" one of the aloe tribe, is now chiefly grown as hedges to keep out cattle. It yields a strong fibre, which was formerly much used in the manufacture of rope and coarse matting. Where hemp (san) is procurable, however, the aloe is at a discount, as the process of making rope and matting from the former is far easier than from the latter. In the district jail many of the prisoners are employed in turning the aloe to account in the manner abovementioned, as tolerably hard labour is demanded to beat out a certain amount of fibre in an allotted time.\n\nThe senhur (Epicarpus orientales) and other plants.\u2014The senhur, a plant of the euphorbia tribe, also forms excellent hedges for the prevention of cattle trespass and for the protection of young trees. It is everywhere common. The mad\u00e1r (Culatropis Hamiltoni) is generally regarded as an ill-favoured weed; but it has its uses notwithstanding, for valuable medicinal properties akin to those of the ip\u00e9ca\u00e7uanha plant are ascribed to it. That queen of poisonous plants, the dhat\u00fara (Datura alba),* with its lovely bell-shaped flower, is but too common in the district. Although it possesses so evil a reputation, it is permitted to flourish unmolested up to the very doors of the houses. The flower of the \"harsingh\u00e1r\" (Nyctanthes arbor tristis) is carefully collected and dried in the sun, after which it is steeped in water and simmered over a slow fire, when it produces a brilliant yellow dye. This dye is not so much esteemed, however, as that yielded by the cultivated \"kusam\" or safflower.\n\nThe palm.\u2014There are but few palm trees left in this part of the country. They have gradually died off, or been cut down, and have not been replaced. Some fine trees are still to be seen in the neighbourhood of M\u00e1nikpur. The Khaj\u00far or date palm (Phoenix sylvestris) and the t\u00e1r (Borassus flabelliformis) are the only two varieties known to this district.\n\nGrasses.\u2014Of grasses and ridges there are several varieties. Those most esteemed are the d\u00fab,\u2020 (the sweetest and best of all, and which, when carefully tended, is equal to English lawn grass), the janewar, the moth\u00e1,\u2021 the senwei, the danura, and the makraili, of prostrate grasses. The senwei and danura come up and are reaped with the rice crop. Of standing grasses, the sarpat, the sentha, the g\u00e1ndar, or tin, the k\u00e1sa, and the kus are the best known and most useful.\n\n---\n\n* The \"kila dhat\u00fara\" (Datura fastuosa) is also to be met with, but is not so common. It is the more powerful poison of the two.\n\n\u2020 Scientific name Agrostis linearis.\n\n\u2021 Scientific name Cyperus rotundus.\nThe sarpat (Saccharum moonja).\u2014The \"sarpat\" grass is chiefly found along the banks of the Ganges, and to some extent by the sides of the Sai and other streams. It delights in a light sandy soil, and attains to a considerable height in the cold weather. When in full flower, in the month of November, it is highly ornamental. The uses to which this grass is put are numerous, and it forms, where grown to any extent, a really valuable property. Each plant possesses three separate parts, each part being known by a distinctive name, and applied to a different use. The leaf or blade is called sarpat, and is used for thatching. The upper and tapering portion of the stem, for about three feet or so, is incased within three wrappers or sheaths. This goes by the name of sirki, and comes into use in the manufacture of winnowing fans, sieves, &c., and for the coverings of carts in the rainy season. The wrappers or sheaths are called \"munj,\"* and of these when thoroughly dried and beaten out, twine and matting are extensively prepared. Lastly, the flower even comes into play, being tied into bunches and figuring as the domestic broom.\n\nThe g\u00e1ndar or tin grass (Andropagan muricatum)\u2020 and the \"K\u00e1sa\" (Andispoya muricatum).\u2014From the root of the g\u00e1ndar or tin grass is obtained the scented fibre called \"khas,\" of which the cooling apparatus known by the name of tatties are made. The upper joint of the culm of this grass is styled \"sink,\" and from it are manufactured numerous small articles of domestic use, such as fans, grain baskets, &c. The tin or leaf is called the sarpat, also used for thatching purposes; but is greatly preferred to the latter being thicker and more impervious to wet. The k\u00e1sa is a less esteemed grass. It is, however, made into coarse string occasionally.\n\nThe kus grass.\u2014The kus possesses no practical utility that I am aware of. A blade of kus grass is made the accompaniment by Hindus of any gift offered to a Brahman. In the month of October (Ku\u00e1r), when the Hindu head of the family makes his yearly oblation of water to his ancestors, he always makes a point of wearing on the third finger of each hand a ring made out of kus grass; and it is this kus grass which has given the name to the tenure known as \"kushast shankalp,\" the literal meaning of kushast being through the medium of kus.\u2021\n\nRivers.\u2014The rivers of the district are the Sai, the Ganges, and the Gumti. The principal river is the Sai, which traverses four-fifths of the length of the district. This river, which is never perfectly dry, rises in the Hardoi district in Oudh, and running through that and the adjoining district of Rae Bareli, enters Partabgarh between the Partabgarh and Kunda tahsils, and, with innumerable sinuosities, maintains a south-easterly course through the Partabgarh into the Patti pargana, where it leaves the district and enters Jaunpur. It is finally united to the Gumti some\n\n* The munj of the \"khajhwa,\" a species of \"sarpat\" peculiar to the banks of the Ganges, is of no use whatever.\n\u2020 Pallaria ziraina of Linn\u00e6us.\u2014Vide Drury's plants of India, p. 38.\n\u2021 Kus grass, hast, the hand, the grass passes from one hand to another, as does the tenure, hence the name.\ntwenty miles south-east of the town of Jaunpur. The Sai runs chiefly between high banks at a considerable depth below the level of the adjoining country. It seems probable that this depth was greater formerly, as the quantity of soil carried into the river is very great, and must be gradually raising the bed to a level with the surrounding country. The regular working of the annual rains in the alluvial lands of the Gangetic valley, to bring the surface irregularities of the soil to an uniform level, must have struck every one who has been for any length of time conversant with that part of the country. This river is navigable in the rains, as is also the Gumti all the year round.\n\nThe Gumti forms the boundary of the Patti pargana for a distance of about five miles only, quite in the north-east corner of the district, where it abuts on the borders of the adjacent district of Sultanpur. To the south-west again, in an entirely opposite direction, flows the Ganges, separating the lands of parganas M\u00e1nikpur and Bih\u00e1r from the neighbouring North-Western Provinces territory, for a distance of some forty-four miles. It leaves the district at a village named Jah\u00e9nabad, in the Bih\u00e1r pargana, about eighteen miles above Allahabad. The two rivulets\u2014called the Chop and the Du\u00e1r\u2014empty their contents into the Ganges.\n\nWatershed.\u2014Regarding the watershed of the district, Mr. King writes:\u2014\"Nearly the whole of the watershed of the district lies towards the river Sai, which is thus in the rains a considerable stream. It receives the waters of several tributary rivulets, among which the Gogra, Lon, Sakarni, Bakl\u00e1hi from the south, and the Udepur and Mangapur n\u00e1las, the Chamrowa and Puraiya, the n\u00e1las at D\u00edw\u00e1nganj and Parhat, and the Pili nadi from the north, are the most considerable. The district is, in fact, the basin of the Sai river. It is not till the immediate neighbourhood of the Ganges is reached that the watershed lies towards the south.\"\n\nLakes.\u2014There are many natural lakes, mostly small and more usually known as jhils or tanks; but some are of considerable area, and in the height of the rains measure some miles in circumference, and cover large areas with shallow water. The lakes of Behti, Nanera, and Rohenia are the most considerable of these. The surface accumulations of water are pretty evenly distributed over the district, but are seldom found near the banks of the Ganges or the Sai. The drainage afforded by these rivers naturally causes a scouring of the top soil, and this, carried on through centuries, has now removed much of the loamy deposit which formerly covered with a uniform coat the surface of the Gangetic valley. The sand, which underlies the loam at no great depth, is unable to retain the water which is carried off through the soil into n\u00e1las and ravines whence it finds its way into the stream. Where the clay or loam exists, the water is retained, and, as said above, this is pretty fairly distributed over the district in wide and shallow lakes. To attempt to deepen these considerably would be to defeat the purpose they now serve, for if the excavation were continued to the sand that lies below, the whole of the water would pass\naway into the earth and be lost; they average about three feet deep, but are practically of no use for navigation or transport.\n\nWild animals.\u2014It is hardly to be expected that there should be many wild animals in a district so highly cultivated; nevertheless wolves still exist in the ravines and grass n\u00e1las, and frequently commit depredations on the flocks of the shepherds. Their numbers are yearly diminishing, and, with the continuance of the imperial grant for their destruction, will soon become a thing of the past. During the last ten years 256 wolves have been destroyed, while the total sum paid in rewards has amounted to Rs. 740. For a full-grown animal from Rs. 3 to 6 are allowed, and for a cub Re. 1 only. Of enemies to cultivation may be mentioned the nil-g\u00e1e, wild cattle, pig, and monkeys. These last are to be seen in most large groves, and owing to the prejudice against killing them entertained by the Hindus, their numbers remain constant. They are exceedingly mischievous, and their devastations extend from the time the seed is put into the ground until it is ripe for the sickle. Nil-g\u00e1e, wild cattle, and pig are almost entirely confined to the grass or kachh\u00e1r lands on the borders of the Ganges. They occasion very considerable damage in those villages which are within a distance of 5 or 6 miles from the river, and travelling as they do in large herds, a night's work is often attended with serious loss to the cultivator. Snakes are not numerous. From January, 1865, to the end of 1869, only 255 appear to have been killed for the Government rewards, which amounted to Rs. 56-13-0.\n\nGame.\u2014There is a fair sprinkling of small game in the Partabgarh district, consisting principally of the hare, pea-fowl (Pavo cristatus), grey partridge (Ortigornis pontixviana), common snipe (Gallinago gallinula), large grey or European quail (Coturnix coromandelica), the bush quail (Perdicula combryensis), together with several varieties of geese and ducks. The black partridge (Francolinas vulgaris) is a comparatively rare bird, and is to be found chiefly in the sarpat and k\u00e1sa grass along the banks of the Ganges.\nCHAPTER II.*\n\nAGRICULTURE AND COMMERCE.\n\nVegetable products.\u2014Cultivation and produce, fibres, indigo and cotton, p\u00e9n gardens\u2014T\u00e1l and jh\u00fal produce\u2014Harvest\u2014Rotation of crops\u2014Agricultural implements\u2014Enemies of produce\u2014Agricultural operations\u2014Irrigation\u2014Maurice\u2014Cattle, sheep, and goats\u2014Rents\u2014Distribution of land\u2014Agricultural labour\u2014Village establishment\u2014Statement of prices\u2014Fish\u2014Bazaars and markets\u2014Fairs, bathing places, and shrines\u2014Manufactures\u2014Trade and traffic\u2014Ferries, roads, and bridges.\n\nVegetable products.\u2014Under this head will be noticed more or less briefly the ordinary cereals, millets, pulses, and oil-seeds. The only dyes which are cultivated, with the exception of the Harsingh\u00e1r referred to in the last chapter, are the kusam (Curthamus tinctorius), which is sown with the spring crops; haldi or turmeric (Curcuma longa), chiefly grown by Mur\u00e1os amongst other garden stuffs; and indigo (Indigofera tinctoria), sugarcane, poppy, tobacco, cotton, and the fibres; sanai (Crotalaria juncea) and patwa (Hibiscus cannabinus) complete the list of the crops ordinarily cultivated in this district.\n\nWheat.\u2014The white and the red wheat are both grown in these parts. There are two species of the former\u2014the spike-eared and the awnless. These both go by the name of \u201cdaudi,\u201d\u2020 while the red wheat is called \u201clalae.\u201d If there be any actual difference between these species in this country, it appears to be but little appreciated by the native husbandman, the selling price being uniform for all three. I have always regarded the white wheat as finer and heavier grain than the red.\n\nCultivation and produce.\u2014Wheat requires ample irrigation, and in this district the fields are flooded at least three times during the cold season. In good goind lands, or lands within a certain distance of the village site, luxuriant crops of wheat may generally be seen; thus showing that it thrives best in a well manured and rich soil. The seed is almost invariably sown in drills. In the subjoined table the irrigated lands are shown under two heads\u2014viz., manured and unmanured; while the unirrigated lands refer chiefly to those low and moist kh\u00e1dir lands on the borders of rivers and rain-streams, where, from the constant supply of latent moisture, the soil never stands in need of irrigation:\n\n| Irrigated land | Unirrigated land |\n|----------------|-----------------|\n|                | Manured. | Unmanured. | M. s. c. | M. s. c. | M. s. c. |\n| Average produce per acre of wheat | ... | 17 2 0 | 12 10 0 | 18 34 0 |\n\n* This chapter is taken with a few alterations and additions from the Partabgarh settlement report.\n\u2020 Probably after the g\u00e1l-e-daudi, the common camomile flower.\nThose figures, calculating the maund at 82\u00b724lbs., represent\u2014\n\nFor manured land ... ... ... 33\u00b787 bushels.\n,, unmanured ditto ... ... ... 16\u00b779 \"\n,, unirrigated 'khadir' ditto ... ... 18\u00b798 \"\n\nThe average on the three kinds of land being thus 19\u00b771 bushels, and this is believed to be a very fair average for the district.\n\nReference to English standard.\u2014In his Farmer's Encyclopaedia, Johnson has the following regarding the produce of wheat:\n\n\"The fair produce of wheat varies so much upon different kinds of land, and is so much governed by climate and mode of cultivation, that it is difficult to form any acreable estimate of the amount on soils of average quality in ordinary seasons, and under the common course of management: it may, however, be fairly calculated at three quarters or perhaps twenty-eight bushels per imperial acre. To produce the latter quantity, circumstances must however be favourable, and anything beyond that may be considered large, though on some land four to five quarters are not unusual. The weight may average 60lbs. per bushel. The straw is generally reckoned to be about double the weight of the grain; an acre producing three quarters of wheat of the ordinary quality may therefore be presumed to yield about twenty-six cwt.\"\n\nMaking due allowance therefore for the two important conditions, \"climate and mode of cultivation,\" an outturn of 19\u00b771 bushels per acre, over an extensive wheat growing district, is not at all a bad one.\n\nBarley.\u2014Barley is of all grains the most extensively cultivated in this district. The soil is eminently adapted to it, and so would appear to be the climate also; for regarding this cereal the same writer, whom I have above quoted, records that \"barley is a tender plant, and easily hurt in any stage of its growth. It is more hazardous than wheat, and is generally speaking raised at a greater expense, so that its cultivation should not be attempted, except where the soil and climate are favourable for its growth.\" Again, in another place the writer goes on to say. \"The land that produces the best barley is generally of a silicious, light, dry nature. Cold wet soils, which are peculiarly retentive of water, are ill adapted to the growth of this grain, both in reference to its weight and its malting qualities. The whole matter of barley and its straw contains more silicious particles than that of any other grain cultivated by the British farmer; and hence one reason why a sandy soil is most congenial to the growth of this plant.\" Certainly in this part of India barley does not appear to be a tender plant; nor does it require greater expense in its cultivation than wheat. For while the latter demands a rich soil, constant moisture, and in the up lands and other dry localities at least two waterings, barley thrives best on land but slightly manured, and will suffer but little, if it does not get more than one watering.\n\nProduce of barley.\u2014The average yield per acre of barley may be safely set down at sixteen maunds per acre, which, assuming the bushel of barley\nto weigh 50 lbs., and the maund as before to be 82.24 lbs., represents 1315.84 lbs. or 26.31 bushels. The usual crop in England, it is said, is from twenty-eight to thirty-six or thirty-eight bushels. An average of 26.31 bushels does not therefore, in my opinion, belie the alleged fertility of the soil of this district.\n\nRice.\u2014There are four sorts of rice ordinarily grown\u2014viz., those distinguished by the names of \"ku\u00e1ri dh\u00e1n,\" \"jethi dh\u00e1n,\" \"s\u00e1thi dh\u00e1n,\" and \"jarhan.\" The principal rice localities are the low-lying lands of the Patti tahsil, and the neighbourhood of the large hills and swamps in the tahsil of Kunda. But little rice is to be seen in Partabgarh. These last three divisions of the district may be said to depend mainly on the spring or rabi harvest; while a failure of the khar\u00edf or autumn crops causes most distress in Patti.\n\nYield, rate, &c.\u2014The yield of the different sorts of rice above enumerated varies a good deal. The outturn per acre of ku\u00e1ri dh\u00e1n is on an average from twelve to thirteen maunds, and the selling price at harvest time is ordinarily one maund for the rupee. Ku\u00e1ri dh\u00e1n is sown with the first fall of rain, and is cut in Ku\u00e1r (September-October), hence the name. Jethi dh\u00e1n is sown in April in places where water is still lying, and it is cut at the beginning of June. This kind of rice prevails chiefly in the Kunda tahsil. The average yield per acre is from eighteen to twenty maunds. This rice (which appears to be precisely similar to the ku\u00e1ri rice) entails far more labour in its cultivation than any of the other kinds. During the great period of its growth the fields are flooded. But the water is not allowed to lie incessantly. It is generally allowed to lie for twelve hours, and is then drained off for twelve hours. This latter period is during the night. S\u00e1thi rice\u2014so called because it is said to ripen sixty days after sowing\u2014is the least esteemed of the different sorts of this grain. S\u00e1thi dh\u00e1n is very little grown, and is seldom cultivated in places where there is the least hope of a better crop. The average produce per acre may be set down at nine or ten maunds. Jarhan is the best rice grown, both as regards quality and quantity; the average yield per acre is fifteen maunds, and the selling price fifty sers for the rupee when cut:\n\n| Rice Type     | Yield per Acre | Selling Price |\n|---------------|----------------|---------------|\n| Ku\u00e1ri dh\u00e1n    | 12-13 maunds   | 1 maund       |\n| Jethi dh\u00e1n    |                |               |\n| S\u00e1thi dh\u00e1n    |                |               |\n| Jarhan        |                |               |\n\nThese three kinds of rice are preferred by the poorer classes to jarhan, because they swell to a much larger bulk in process of cooking, and consequently less is required for a meal. Jarhan is thickly sown in small plots and is transplanted, when rather more than a foot high, in bunches of four or five plants, into fields which have been previously carefully prepared.\n\nGram, peas, and other food grains.\u2014Of other grains, gram, peas, arhar, ju\u00e1r, and bajra are perhaps alone worth special notice. Gram, peas, and arhar cover an extensive area, and are reckoned valuable crops. They belong to the spring or rabi harvest. Gram is a crop to which water is not indispensable, and it is often grown on poor light soil where mud wells are impracticable. Peas and arhar are also hardy crops; but the former,\nto repay the cultivator, requires at least one watering. Arhar again is never irrigated, and may be seen anywhere and everywhere; besides being an important item of food, the stalks are extensively used in the construction of the frame-work supports of the village thatch roofs, specially where the bamboo is not, or is with difficulty procurable. Ju\u00e1r and bajra are kharif millets. The former is sown at the commencement of the rains; the latter about two months later. Both, however, ripen at the same time, and are reaped early in November. The stalks of the ju\u00e1r or jundhri constitute valuable fodder for cattle. It is chopped up into small lengths, and about seven sers go to a feed.\n\nSugarcane.\u2014The cultivation of sugarcane is rapidly extending, and has probably increased during the last ten years, not less than twenty-five per cent. Three kinds of cane are cultivated\u2014viz., saroti, k\u00faswar, and k\u00e1t\u00e1ra,\u2014all varieties of the *Saccharum officinarum*. The last named is used for eating only; four or five stalks, according to the size, being procurable for a pice. Gur is made from the juice of the other two kinds, and is of the best quality in pargana Patti. One bigha of good cane should, as a rule, produce fifteen maunds of gur, the average value of which is from thirteen to fourteen sers for the rupee. This represents a total value of Rs 72 for the produce of an acre. Deducting the expenses according to the following scale:\n\n| Item                        | Rs. a. p. |\n|-----------------------------|-----------|\n| Rent of one acre            | 12 12 9   |\n| Seed                        | 4 0 0     |\n| Herding sheep and manuring  | 3 3 3     |\n| Sowing and ploughing        | 4 12 9    |\n| Seven waterings             | 22 6 6    |\n| ,, dressings                | 8 12 9    |\n| **Total**                   | **56 0 0** |\n\nthe cultivator may reckon on a clear profit of Rs. 16, which is a higher return than can be looked for from an acre of wheat, barley, or other ordinary crop. It is not therefore to be wondered at that the cultivation of sugarcane should prove somewhat attractive, and long may it continue so; for the higher the standard of cultivation the better the prospect of a speedy improvement in the circumstances and condition of the agricultural classes, whether owners of the soil or mere tenants-at-will. Regarding sugarcane Mr. King has left the following remarks on record:\n\n\"Sugarcane has been almost confined hitherto to the Patti tahsil, which is credited with 6,930 bighas of the crop out of 9,933 bighas in the whole district. Since the assessment, however, a great impetus has been given to this branch of agriculture, and in the Partabgarh tahsil a considerable quantity is now grown. In Bih\u00e1r* the white-ants are said to prevent the grain being grown, and this appears to be true; for it is not unusual to see in a village several fine stone sugarcane mills, although cane has not been grown within the memory of man. Judging from the number of these deserted evidences of a former cultivation, I should say that in Bih\u00e1r there had been, some seventy or eighty years\n\n* Now the Kunda tahsil.\nago, a far greater growth of sugarcane than is now to be seen in any part of the district.\"\n\n**Poppy.**\u2014The cultivation of the poppy (*Papaver somniferum*) being under the close superintendence of the opium department, the extent to which it has increased, and the rate at which it is increasing, can be accurately ascertained. The following figures furnished by the opium officer of this circle exhibit the area under poppy in 1860-61, as compared with the present year. The ratio of increase is no less than 606\u00b76 per cent.\n\n| Sown with poppy in 1860-61 | Acres |\n|---------------------------|-------|\n| Ditto ditto 1870-71       | 1,239 |\n\nNotwithstanding the past increase exhibited by these figures, I am by no means prepared to say that the cultivation of poppy is particularly popular. The last year's export of opium from the Partabgarh district has been returned at 900 maunds, representing at four rupees a ser, the price paid to the cultivator, the sum of Rs. 1,44,000. The extraction of the drug is a troublesome and dirty process. When the flower falls off, and the capsules attain a sufficient size, the opium is extracted. This is done by means of longitudinal incisions and inspissation.\n\n**Tobacco.**\u2014Tobacco is a very fine crop in this district. It is grown wherever the locality and water are favourable. It flourishes on high lands, and more specially on old ruined sites, and it requires abundant well water, which should possess saline properties. Sweet water, or water from tanks and ponds, is held to be injurious to the growth of good tobacco. From a return which was prepared in the settlement department last April, I find that there are about 1,177 bighas, or 736 acres, grown with tobacco. The average outturn per standard bigha is five maunds fourteen sers, or eight mannds twenty-two sers per acre; and the average rent for tobacco land is Rs. 10-13-6 per acre. At the ordinary selling price of seven sers for the rupee, the gross value of the produce of an acre may be set down at Rs. 48-14-4.\n\nDeducting expenses as below:\n\n| Item                          | Rs. a. p. |\n|-------------------------------|-----------|\n| Rent of one acre              | 10 13 6   |\n| Ploughing                     | 1 9 6     |\n| Manuring                      | 1 8 3     |\n| Eight waterings               | 12 12 9   |\n| Weeding and loosening the earth about the roots | 1 9 6     |\n| **Total, Rs.**                | **28 0 5** |\n\nthe average clear profit on the acre amounts to Rs. 20-13-10, and this figure is, I believe, very moderate. I trust that the recent experiment of introducing the American tobacco-seed may prove successful; for I cannot but think that, with moderate care, the yield will be a safe and highly profitable source of income.\nFibres, indigo, and cotton.\u2014Regarding the cultivated fibres, san\u00e1i and patwa, indigo and cotton, Mr. King writes as follows:\n\n\"Hemp, sanai, a tall plant, with a light yellow flower. The fibre is used for well ropes and is called san.\n\n\"Patwa is grown in ju\u00e1r fields. It has a bell-shaped light yellow flower, and the fibre, which is called san, is used for common purposes. The above are cultivated fibres.\n\n\"Dyes.\u2014Indigo is grown a little, and is made up in the native method. There are indigo planters' lands to the extent of some 3,000 or 4,000 bighas in the district. The produce is sent to Calcutta.\n\n\"Cotton is not much grown. A return made in 1866-67 showed an estimated area of 2,693 acres, and an outturn of 2,430 maunds of cleaned cotton, which shows that the crop is not a heavy one in this country.\"\n\nUncultivated fibres.\u2014Of uncultivated fibres may be here mentioned the silmil, one of the Leguminosae, a tall, thin looking plant, which is found here and there in the \"kachh\u00e1r\" lands bordering the Ganges. It seeds in the cold season, the seeds being contained in very long narrow pods. Mr. G. P. Gartlan, Manager of the Palmerland Estate, showed me some of the fibre. It was very clean, and apparently of considerable strength; but it would, he informed me, scarcely repay cultivation, the yield of fibre being too small. The fibre comes from the corticate casing of the stem, after a certain period of immersion. It has been already mentioned that the \"dh\u00e1k\" tree furnishes a coarse fibre. There remains the sarpat grass, producing, as Mr. King writes, \"a fine fibre, which is made up and called b\u00e1dh, used for stringing the common native charpoy or bed, and for making up the bamboo frame-work of roofs.\"\n\nP\u00e1n gardens.\u2014Plantations of the succulent creeper called p\u00e1n (Piper chavica) are very common in the district. The plant thrives best in a stiff soil, which is retentive of moisture. The site selected is generally an elevated spot with a good slope. The Tamboli or Barai then proceeds to plough, level, and clean the land thoroughly: this done, he encloses it with stakes and brushwood, and he then covers it in with a roof of sentha grass. Shallow trenches are next scooped out about two feet wide by five or six inches deep. These trenches are about five feet apart. Water is then let into them, and when the soil is thoroughly saturated, the planting commences, which is performed in this wise. A full-grown plant, after it has been sufficiently stripped, is cut down close to the root. It is then divided into three or four portions, and these are laid horizontally in the trenches and covered over with earth. In the course of a few days, at each knot or excrescence, sprouts will appear, and each of these sprouts becomes a separate plant, and is trained to grow up sticks fixed in the ground for the purpose. P\u00e1n planting goes on from February\n\n* There are three kinds of cotton grown in this district, viz., radhia, manwa, and ku\u00e1ri kap\u00e1s. The first is the most productive and the most highly esteemed.\nto April, and, except when rain happens to fall, each row receives two and sometimes three waterings daily. From about the middle of June commences the stripping of the leaves, and continues regularly for about a year, after which the plant becomes exhausted, and is used for stocking a fresh plantation on another site, the old site being allowed to rest for a year or two. The leaf is sold in bundles of 200 called dholfi, the price varying according to quality and age of leaf, from 1\u00bd pies to as much as 14 annas per dholfi. The plantation usually consists of twenty rows, or as they are styled \"autar;\" and it is reckoned that one row or \"autar\" should yield on an average Re. 1-8-0. Several kinds of vegetables are also frequently cultivated within the limits of and around p\u00e1n gardens. All produce combined, the yearly returns accruing to a tamboli from his plantation may, on an average, be set down at from Rs. 25 to Rs. 30. Rent is paid to the landlord at the rate of two annas per row, which comes to Rs. 2-8-0 on the whole.\n\nT\u00e1l and jh\u00fal produce.\u2014Under this head I shall shortly notice the singh\u00e1ra, a kind of water nut; the pas\u00e1hi or pass\u00e1ri, and the tinni, both species of wild rice, and the kaser\u00fa, a succulent root of the gon grass, of which matting is made, and which grows in water.\n\nSingh\u00e1ra (Trapa bispinosa).\u2014In the month of November the singh\u00e1ra nut ripens, and such of the fruit as remains from gathering falls off and sinks to the bottom of the water. When the water dries up in May or June, these nuts or bulbs are found to have thrown out a number of shoots. They are then carefully collected into a small hole in the deepest portion of the tank or pond, and covered with water: when the rains commence and the ponds begin to fill the bulbs are taken up; each shoot is broken off, enveloped in a ball of clay, in order to sink it, and thrown into the water at different distances. They at once take root and grow rapidly, until in a short time the surface of the water is covered with the plants. The fruit forms in October. The produce of a standard bigha is about two and a half mauuds, which, at the selling price of ten sers for the rupee, represents a total value of Rs. 10. As an article of food the singh\u00e1ra is much more extensively consumed by the Hindus than by the Muhammadans.\n\nPas\u00e1hi or pass\u00e1ri and tinni (Zizania aquatica).\u2014These are both species of wild rice of spontaneous growth, found on the borders of certain ponds and swamps. The tinni is a larger and better grain than the other. The sale is regulated by the price current of ordinary rice or dh\u00e1n, the amount of the former procurable for one rupee being half as much again as that of the latter; while the pas\u00e1hi or pass\u00e1ri, as it is also called, is somewhat cheaper still.\n\nKaser\u00fa (Cyperus tuberosus).\u2014The kaser\u00fa is the root of the sedge called gon, and is dug up after the water has dried up. It is highly esteemed for its reputed cooling properties, and finds an extensive sale in large towns and bazars; the ordinary price being two annas per ser standard weight. The digging is a very labourious process, as the coveted root lies very deep in the ground. P\u00e1sis, Kah\u00e1rs, and Kurmis are the most industrious\nsearchers, and are allowed three-fourths of their findings on condition of yielding up the remaining share to the lord of the manor.\n\n**Harvests.**\u2014There are only two principal harvests as recognized in the district of Partabgarh, known by the well known names of the rabi and kharif. The name henwat is unknown here. Within the kharif harvest, however, may be said to be included three minor harvests called after the months in which the several crops ripen. These are styled bhadui, ku\u00e1ri, and agahni. The subjoined table shows the division of these harvests, with regard to the ripening of produce:\n\n| Rabi | Kharif |\n|------|--------|\n|      | Bhadui | Ku\u00e1ri | Agahni |\n| Wheat | S\u00e1nw\u00e1n | Dh\u00e1n | Jarhan rice |\n| Barley | Urd | Kodo | B\u00e1jra |\n| Arhar | K\u00e1kun | Til (white) | Ju\u00e1r |\n| Peas | Makra | Til (black) | Urd |\n| Gram | B\u00e1gri dh\u00e1n | Patwa | Moth |\n| Sugarcane | *S\u00e1thi dh\u00e1n* | Sanai | M\u00e1ng |\n| Poppy | | Maize | Fatwa (seed) |\n| S\u00e1nw\u00e1n | | Cotton | R\u00e1m\u00e1na |\n| Jethi dh\u00e1n | | | Lobia |\n| Mas\u00far | | | Bhatoi |\n| Sarson | | | |\n| Barre or kusam | | | |\n| Mustard | | | |\n| Linseed | | | |\n| Tobacco | | | |\n| Cotton (manwa) | | | |\n| Cotton (radhia) | | | |\n\nSugarcane, s\u00e1nw\u00e1n, and jethi dh\u00e1n are to a certain extent intermediate crops, but belong more properly to the rabi division than to the kharif.\n\n**Rotation of crops.**\u2014Fallows being in these days almost unknown, and manure, as previously stated, by no means abundant, it follows that if a certain rotation of crops were not observed the land would soon be utterly exhausted. By far the greater portion of the cultivated area in these parts is dufasli, or two-crop bearing land. The kharif crop is no sooner off the ground than preparations are at once made for sowing the rabi. A heavy agahni or kharif crop, like ju\u00e1r or b\u00e1jra, is followed by a light spring crop such as peas or barley. This is repeated a second year, and in the third year no autumn crop will be sown; but the land will be well worked up, and prepared for a crop of wheat or sugarcane. The number of ploughings the land requires for different crops varies very much. For instance, wheat is held to require, on an average, eighteen or twenty ploughings; tobacco, sugarcane, peas, and barley fifteen or sixteen ploughings; poppy twelve ploughings; cotton eight; and so forth. Three or four ploughings\n\n* So named because it attains to maturity sixty days after sowing.\nare sufficient for all the autumn produce. This scale is, as regards the rabi produce, all very well in theory, but is largely departed from in practice. As an example, we will suppose the cultivator has just reaped a late kharif or agahni crop. It is manifest that he has only time left for, at most, four or five ploughings before it becomes necessary to put in the seed for the rabi. This inconsistency in practice and theory is met with the reply, that a maximum yield is never looked for at both harvests. Let a good ju\u00e1r or such like crop be secured, and the cultivator is satisfied with half the possible outturn of barley or peas six months later. He is seldom, however, satisfied with the certainty of a short out-turn of a valuable crop, as wheat, &c., and prefers to forego the kharif harvest entirely, so that he may bestow on the land the requisite number of ploughings for a valuable rabi, and, indeed, it is no exaggeration, with reference to this district, to say that such lands are tilled twenty times, and even more, before they are sown. When the native capitalist consents to experiment with prepared manures and steam ploughs, combined with a proper observance of fallows, we may look forward to a brighter future for the science of agriculture in this country. At present, however, while labour continues so cheap, such experiments would hardly prove remunerative.\n\nAgricultural implements.\u2014The rude implements of husbandry in vogue in this district differ but little; except perhaps in name from those ordinarily used in the upper provinces of India.\n\nEnemies of produce.\u2014Of the injurious influences to which wheat and barley are liable may be mentioned first, excessive cloud and vapour, hail, the blight, and mildew known as dh\u00e1ra and girwi, and the worm. Frost, excessive vapour, and hail are general enemies of all the rabi crops. The first is specially fatal to arhar, peas, and gram. Blight and mildew are the natural consequences of a continued easterly wind with cloud and damp. Sugarcane is liable, when the plants are still young, to the ravages of an insect called bhungi, which eats up and destroys the leaf. At a later stage the roots are sometimes attacked by a grub called diw\u00e1r or t\u00e1ra, while at a time when the plant has escaped these, and bids fair to ripen well, it not unfrequently withers away under the blighting influence of a disease called k\u00e1ri which dries up the juice and causes the stock to look black. Gram is liable, as was manifested last year, to the ravages of a caterpillar called gadhela, which lies concealed during the day and at night sallies forth and literally eats up the entire plant. The pods of peas and arhar, when fully formed, are often attacked by a species of wire worm, which pierces the shell and destroys the fruit. Rice, when nearly ready for the sickle, is liable to the devastation of a fly called g\u00e1ndhi, by which the grain is rendered useless. Rice also suffers from a blight called khaira, which turns the ears an orange colour and destroys them. All the oil-seeds, except the alsi or linseed, are prone to the ravages of a fly called \"m\u00e1h\u00fan,\" which attacks the plant when a few inches high, and covering it with a glutinous slime effectually prevents it from arriving at maturity. Owing to the \"m\u00e1h\u00fan\" there is little or no mustard in the district this year.\nAgricultural operations.\u2014From the time the spring crops are cut in March and April until the commencement of the rains (about the end of June) is the idle season of the year, and it is during this interval that disputes arising out of the arrangements to be made for the ensuing agricultural year so often terminate in riots. With the first signs of rain, however, the cultivator, if not evicted, has something else to think about, and ploughing and sowing the early kharif seed entirely engages his time and attention. It may not be uninteresting to record here in a calendar form the different agricultural operations of each month of the fasil\u00ed year, which commences about the same time as the monsoon.\n\nJune-July (As\u00e1rh).\u2014Ploughing in preparation both for rabi and kharif harvests, sowing ku\u00e1ri dh\u00e1n, makra, maize, s\u00e1nw\u00e1n, k\u00e1kun, urd, ju\u00e1r r\u00e1md\u00e1na, patwa, sanai, kodo, jarhan rice, mung, til, cotton (manwa and radhia), arhar, lobia, and bhatoi; driving the h\u00ednga to break up the clods and cover in the seed; herding sheep and cattle in the fields for the purpose of manuring and enriching the soil.\n\nJuly-August (S\u00e1wan).\u2014Weeding and earthing up ku\u00e1ri dh\u00e1n, makra, maize, s\u00e1nwan, k\u00e1kun, ju\u00e1r, and kodo. Ploughing for the rabi. At the end of the month transplanting jarhan rice after fresh ploughing and leveling with the h\u00ednga. Herding sheep and cattle as above.\n\nAugust-September (Bh\u00e1don).\u2014Ploughing for the rabi. A second weeding of the crops mentioned under the last month. Reaping and carrying the bhadain or bh\u00e1don harvest. Herding sheep and cattle as above. Transplanting jarhan, sowing urd, mothi, b\u00e1jra, and arhar.\n\nSeptember-October (Ku\u00e1r).\u2014Reaping, carrying, and threshing the ku\u00e1ri harvest. Ploughing and leveling with h\u00ednga lands for rabi. Rotting the sanai stalks by immersion in water to obtain the fibre. Sowing the following rabi seeds\u2014viz., gram, peas, barre, or kusam, linseed, and sehuan. Herding sheep and cattle as before; gathering cotton (kap\u00e1s).\n\nOctober-November (K\u00e1rtik).\u2014Manuring for the better rabi crops, sewing peas, gram, wheat, barley, mas\u00far, barre, linseed, sarson, mustard, sehuan, poppy, and tobacco, and then leveling and covering in with h\u00ednga. Making irrigation beds or squares with pharwa.\n\nNovember-December (Ag\u00e1h\u00e1n).\u2014Reaping, carrying, and threshing the agahni harvest. Chopping up the cane, and carrying it to the mill. First watering of the rabi crops; weeding and loosening soil around the poppy.\n\nDecember-January (P\u00fa\u0161).\u2014Manufacture of gur. Second watering of rabi crops. Weeding and loosening soil round the poppy. Pruning the tobacco plants in order to cause them to throw out leaves from the base of the main stem.\n\nJanuary-February (M\u00e1gh).\u2014Manufacture of gur. Third watering of the rabi. Flooding and preparing land for reception of cane. Early sowing of the latter and irrigating about a week afterwards. Herding sheep and cattle as in As\u00e1rh, S\u00e1wan, &c. Flooding and preparing fields for\nSowing s\u00e1nw\u00e1n and covering in with h\u00ednga. Should rain fall in this month, the bijar or ku\u00e1ri dh\u00e1n fields are ploughed. Early peas cut and carried. At the end of this month, incisions are made in the poppy heads with the pachhni towards evening, and the opium, which exudes, is collected with the kachhni early the next morning.\n\nFebruary-March (Ph\u00e1gun).\u2014Fourth irrigation of rabi, which watering however is confined to wheat, sugarcane, tobacco, and poppy. Continuation of sugarcane planting and of s\u00e1nw\u00e1n sowing. Putting sickle to the barley, peas, and here and there early sown wheat. Gathering sarson. Manufacture of gur. Extracting opium as described in M\u00e1g.\n\nChait.\u2014Harvesting wheat, barley, peas, gram, linseed, seh\u00fa\u00e1n, mustard, barre, and arhar; cutting down poppy and tobacco; irrigation of cotton; continuation of sugarcane sowing, and watering of that previously sown in M\u00e1g and Ph\u00e1gun; flooding and preparing fields for the jethi dh\u00e1n, which is sown in this month of and irrigated constantly up to the time that it is cut in this and following months. Threshing out and winnowing of grain in the kh\u00e1l\u00edan or threshing floors.\n\nBais\u00e1kh.\u2014Irrigation of sugarcane, cotton, tobacco, and s\u00e1nw\u00e1n, gathering the kap\u00e1s or ordinary cotton. Storing bh\u00fasa brought from the threshing floors.\n\nJeth.\u2014Manuring the khar\u00edf fields. Irrigating the sugarcane and s\u00e1nw\u00e1n second cutting down of tobacco plants. In this month, the cultivators re-thatch their huts in anticipation of the coming rains, and store fodder, wood, and cow-dung fuel.\n\nIrrigation.\u2014Under district R\u00e1e Bareli is given an elaborate account of irrigation from masonry wells in the high land which skirts the Ganges, the same holds true for this district. Throughout this tract, whose breadth is from three to seven miles, water is met with at from 50 to 60 feet from the surface, but the digging is generally continued about fifteen feet further till good springs are reached. The entire depth then will be 75 feet or fifty cubits, the cost of digging is estimated at one rupee a cubit, but such a well will last many years, and two large leather buckets can be used in it.\n\nFrom such a well two superior bullocks, whose labour is worth four annas per day, will draw up in an entire day of nine hours enough water for five biswas; three men will attend them and the distribution of the water. They will water a bigha in four days at a cost of one rupee for cattle, and one rupee eight annas for human labour. This will amount to four rupees per acre for one watering.\n\nThe consequence of this costliness is that the cereals, wheat, &c., which require three waterings, hardly ever get more than two, and generally only one. In Patt\u00ed Tahsil water is much nearer the surface averaging about 20 feet; there irrigation is cheaper. It is of the same nature as that described in south Lucknow, which also lies mainly between the Sai and\nthe Gumti. The cost of well-irrigation may be set down in Partabgarh, north of the Sai, as varying between Rs. 2-4-0 per acre and Rs. 4-0-0.\n\nIrrigation is extensively carried on from wells both bricked and unbricked, or as they are styled \"kachcha,\" as well as from jhils, ponds, and excavated tanks. Some of the rivulets or rain streams are also utilized by damming the current.\n\nStreams.\u2014Where the banks of the stream are sufficiently low, the water is baled out with the \"dogla\" or bamboo basket, swung on double ropes, and worked by a couple of men. Four men are told off to each dogla, and each couple works for about half an hour, and is then relieved. A day's work continues for fourteen or fifteen hours out of the twenty-four, and thus each man has more than seven hours of it. Where the banks of the stream are too high for the dogla a convenient spot is selected, and the well apparatus of the moth (leathern bucket) and pulley is brought into play.\n\nJhils, ponds, and tanks.\u2014Irrigation from jhils, ponds, and tanks is carried on by means of the \"dogla\" or the \"dauri.\" The latter is a smaller and lighter basket than the dogla, and is preferred to the latter where the water is deep, and consequently the labour of lifting thereby enhanced. Where the water is some little distance from the cultivation, and the difference of level considerable, a succession of two and three doglas or dauris may be seen working simultaneously at successive points. These points are called \"riks,\" and the water is collected in more or less deep pools at each of them. This system of irrigation is frequently carried on by a co-operative or mutual aid society, the members whereof combine to work together by gangs, until the lands of the whole have been watered. This is in practice found to be more economical than the independent hiring of labourers. In the latter case the daily wage consists generally of three sers of some one of the inferior food grains.\n\nWells.\u2014The water is lifted out of wells by means of the \"moth\" or \"pur,\"* a flexible leathern bucket, containing from two and a half to twelve and a half gallons, which is attached by a strong rope to a pulley. In masonry wells the number of \"l\u00e1sos\" or runs, which can be worked at one and the same time, varies from four to twenty. The average number may be set down at eight. As regards unbricked wells, I have seldom seen more than two l\u00e1sos worked. These l\u00e1sos are worked in this district by men or women, bullocks, and buffaloes. The latter are, however, comparatively rare. Bullocks are of course preferred, and may be said to be the rule. Where men and women are employed, six persons are told off to one l\u00e1s, twelve to two l\u00e1sos, and so on. These are exclusive of two persons, one of whom directs the course of the water in the field, and the other receives and empties the bucket on its arrival at the mouth of the well. A third man is necessary, where bullocks are used, to drive them. Human labour irrigates more quickly than bullocks, but is obviously more expensive, and is only had recourse to when the cultivator\n\n* The \"pur\" is larger than the \"moth,\" and is peculiar to certain parts of the district.\nhas no cattle, or wishes to work more l\u0101os than he has cattle for. The rate of remuneration in such cases is a daily dole of a kachcha panseri (equivalent to one ser fourteen chhat\u0101ks) of some coarse grain such as barley, ju\u00e1r, or b\u00e1jra. During the irrigating season, the same set of men or women will work from early morning before sunrise to nightfall for this pittance. The wage of a worker at the dogla or dauri is higher, and is generally one kachcha panseri and a half (two sers eight chhat\u0101ks), as the labour is far more severe.\n\nCapabilities of irrigation from ponds and wells.\u2014The area of land, which on an average may be irrigated in one day by either of the methods above described, varies inversely according to the distance from the water supply. It may be generally assumed, that about two standard bighas can be irrigated in one day by one relief of two men working one dogla or dauri. More than one relief to the dogla is the exception in this district. Where two reliefs are available, and the distance from the water moderate, from two and a half to two and three-fourths bighas can be supplied in a day. These results are of course affected in a diminishing ratio by the number of riks. One l\u0101o of a masonry well, when worked by human labour, irrigates on an average six biswas standard measure. When bullocks are attached, the average is about three and a half biswas. In the case of kachcha wells these results may be slightly modified. There is, however, very little actual difference. The quality of the soil affects the irrigated area in proportion to its absorbent properties. A larger surface of clay can be irrigated in a day than of loam, and similarly a larger amount of loam than of sand.\n\nCost of wells.\u2014The average cost of constructing a masonry well is Rs. 250. The cost, of course, varies in proportion to the depth of water. The depth in the wells in the Partabgarh district ranges from eleven to eighty feet. Water is nearer the surface in the Patti pargana; less so in parganas Bih\u0101r and R\u0101mpur; and is, as a rule, deepest in Partabgarh.\n\nKachcha and ag\u0101ri wells.\u2014Kachcha wells are impracticable in localities where there is a substratum of white sand, which causes the sides to fall in. These spots are, however, exceptional, and, as a rule, the land in the vicinity is very sandy and sterile. The kachcha well can be sunk at a cost of from 4 to 15 rupees according to circumstances; this latter amount is exceptional. Should the well be required for drinking purposes only, the cost is much less, and may be put down at about one-half. The irrigation well has to be dug much deeper, and in many places the sides must be protected by r\u016bs fascines, or as they are termed by the natives, \u201cbin\u201d or \u201crangarh.\u201d There is a well also, which is supported by large wooden segments, or circular bricks, and which is called \u201cag\u0101ri.\u201d The conversion of a kachcha well into an ag\u0101ri entails an additional cost on the former of from Rs. 5 to Rs. 10. \u201cAg\u0101ri\u201d wells are not, however, very common, except where, owing to the sandy nature of the soil, they are more the rule than the exception.\n\nExtended well-irrigation since annexation and since revised assessment.\u2014I have before recorded that 3,146 masonry wells have been constructed\nin this district since annexation. Of this number 2,256 have been built since the revised assessments were declared in 1863 to 1866. Very few masonry wells are built by persons possessed of any right or title in the soil. With the exception of about 1,106, all the wells in this district have been constructed by persons who have no proprietary or under-proprietary rights in the land. It will be observed that more skilled and industrious cultivators\u2014such as Mur\u00e1os, Kurmis, and Ahirs\u2014have been the most enterprising in this respect. Next come Brahmins, after these, longo sed intervallo, Mah\u00e1jans (bankers) and Bani\u00e1ns. It is at first difficult to perceive the motives, which induce the sinking of so much capital on little or no security, and where there is an impossibility, it appears to me, of ever obtaining such returns in the way of interest as would justify the outlay in the light of a moderately profitable speculation. Desire for distinction and for the grateful recollection of posterity, coupled with the feeling that the act is in accordance with the teachings of the religious codes of both persuasions, appear to be the principal incentives.\n\nManure.\u2014Animal and vegetable manures are made use of wherever procurable. Ashes of burnt cow-dung (kanda), and less often of wood, are also sprinkled over the fields. During the rainy season the leaves of the dh\u00e1k and dhera trees are strewed over fields, which are to be sown with wheat, barley, poppy, and tobacco, and which are ordinarily called \"chaum\u00e1s\" lands.\n\nCultivators stack their manure in convenient places near the village; if possible, on a piece of waste, otherwise in a grove. These manure heaps are a constant and fertile source of dispute, and it is a great object to carefully record in the \"w\u00e1jib-ul-arz,\" or administration paper, such rights in them as are clearly ascertainable. There is at present no traffic in manure except within the limits of municipalities. If a landlord has not enough for his own use, he has no scruple in relieving such of his tenants as are well off in this respect of their surplus stock, and the latter seldom demur to the demand, as it is generally regarded as a manorial right.\n\nCattle, draught, and milch.\u2014For agricultural purposes bullocks are chiefly used. These are as a rule a small breed of cattle, but are capable of undergoing pretty hard work. If there were but a sufficiency of good pasture, I believe they would not be by any means the inferior animals they are generally considered. Buffaloes are used only by those of the more impoverished cultivators, who are unable to afford to buy bullocks, and who are not prevented by local caste prejudices from making use of them. The market price of bullocks varies according to size and age from Rs. 12 to Rs. 40 per pair; whereas a pair of he-buffaloes may be purchased for Rs. 10; more than Rs. 12 is very seldom given or demanded. There is apparently no effort or desire to improve the present breed, and the services of the Government stud bulls are but seldom called into requisition. Nevertheless at several of the local bazars a brisk trade in draught and milch cattle and in buffaloes is carried on. Of milch cattle the buffalo is the most esteemed, and yields the finest gh\u00ed. As much as Rs. 20 is frequently paid for a really good animal of this sort. The country cow gives but little milk, and that little of very poor quality.\nSheep and goats.\u2014There is a fine breed of sheep in the Kunda tahsil. They may be seen in considerable flocks, and are bred by the shepherds who sell but few, as they prefer to keep them for their wool, out of which they manufacture blankets at a larger profit than they could otherwise obtain. There is little to be said regarding the breed of goats in this district. Attempts to improve the breed by the introduction of the larger Trans-Jumna goat have hitherto resulted in failure. The absence of proper pasturage will probably account for this. Goat's flesh as well as goat's milk is a universal item of food amongst all classes. Shepherds, who keep large flocks of sheep and goats, manufacture and sell ghi made from the mixed milk of both animals; it is much sought after, and is mainly consumed by the poor.\n\nPrevalent diseases amongst stock.\u2014Since the fatal outbreak of rinderpest in England, attention has been more closely directed to the diseases of cattle in this country, and there can be no doubt but that the cattle of India are liable to many of the diseases, which have been hitherto supposed to be more or less peculiar to a European climate. The complaint known as the foot and mouth disease broke out in this district a short time since, but not of a fatal type. While a few weeks previously there had been great mortality in several places amongst sheep and goats by the ravages of a disease somewhat resembling rot. It was highly infectious, but in many instances yielded to segregation, with complete change of air and water, when all other means tried had failed.\n\nDistribution of land.\u2014The land is well distributed, the averages taken on the cultivated area falling as follows:\n\n| Per agricultural male adult | ... | ... | 3\u00b71 |\n| Per cultivator's house | ... | ... | 4\u00b79 |\n| Per plough | ... | ... | 5\u00b713 |\n\nWith reference to the extent to which the land is distributed, and the consequent smallness of the average holding, this district stands next to Fyzabad. Cultivators may be broadly classified into resident and non-resident. The resident cultivator, or \"chhaparband,\" is so called because he tills land situated within the limits of the village in which he resides. The non-resident, or \"pahikasht,\" cultivates land in one village while residing in another. Of course there are a considerable class, who from motives of self-interest, expediency, or other cause cultivate land in two or more villages, and who may be said to come under both categories; that is to say, they not only till land in their own village, but are also tenants in a neighbouring village. In point of fact, however, they are reducible to one or other class, according as reference be made to either one or other of the villages in which they cultivate. Thus A. cultivates land in R\u00e1mpur and His\u00e1mpur; but his house is situated in the latter village. He is a pahikasht with respect to R\u00e1mpur, but a chhaparband with respect to His\u00e1mpur.\n\nIncrease to cultivated and wooded areas.\u2014Since the declaration of the revised assessment, very extensive clearances of jungle and waste land have been and are still being made. By an approximate calculation,\nprepared as carefully as circumstances have permitted, I estimate the increase to the cultivated area at 17,900 acres or 3\u00b735 per cent. Much of the land, which the wily zamindars, with rueful countenances, earnestly assured the assessing officers was sterile and fit for nothing, has since been worked up and cleaned, and is now in many places bearing luxuriant crops. By the time the period of the present settlement expires, there will be ample margin whence to correspondingly increase the imperial demand. In cases of large tracts of jungle or waste, the taluqdar or zamindar often sells the land in patches to the highest bidder. The purchaser is generally a banker or other small capitalist, who at once sets to work and rapidly clears the land. Where the plots of waste are small and sparse, the landlord usually lets it out on clearing leases, charged with a nominal rent for at least three years. These leases are almost always taken by the more skilled cultivators. The average cost of clearing brushwood or thorn jungle may be set down at from Rs. 6 to Rs. 10 per acre; while that of grass jungle seldom exceeds from Rs. 2 to Rs. 5 the acre. When the khasra survey was completed there were 76,008 acres under wood. This area has since been extended to about 85,499 acres, or 12\u00b748 per cent., a result we may likewise hail with satisfaction.\n\nRents.\u2014Rents have steadily risen in this district since the introduction of British rule, and still have a tendency to rise. It has been asserted that, if the extraneous items, such as \"batta,\" \"bhent,\" and other such nawabi imposts, be taken into calculation, we shall find that as a matter of fact, rents have not risen. Now this question has been carefully gone into by the settlement officer, and the deliberate conclusion to which he arrived, taking each and every such regularly realized exaction into consideration into account, is that rents under our rules have risen and are rising. This was attributable, in his opinion, to the enhanced value of land, and to competition. He took the papers of 100 villages, which were prepared before annexation, and carefully abstracted their contents. Comparing these contents with jamabandis drawn out since the district came under survey, he found that against a former average rent-rate of Re. 1-10-1 per bigha, taken on the whole 100 villages, we have now (i.e., in 1868), an average rent-rate of Rs. 3-1-1 per bigha. But, it may be urged, these results hardly admit of fair comparison, the bigha in the latter case being the standard bigha of \u00a7ths of an acre, and in the former case, the variable village bigha. This difficulty may, I think, be got over by bearing in mind the following facts, viz.:\n\nOf the villages selected, twenty-five pertain to each tahsil in the district. It has been found, by actual experiment, that in three out of the four tahsils,* the village bigha is actually larger than the standard bigha. In the case of seventy-five villages, therefore, the nawabi rent-rate falls on a larger bigha than the present standard bigha, while in twenty-five villages only does it fall on a smaller one, the difference, in either case, not exceeding four biswas. It follows then, that unquestionably rents are higher than formerly, and that land has acquired a higher market value.\n\n* In the old district.\nAt the same time he found, from the same set of papers, that under the Government of the king of Oudh the total number of cultivators in these one hundred villages was 3,653, and that the average holding of each amounted to six bighas, thirteen biswas, thirteen bisw\u00e1nsis, while under British rule the number of cultivators has increased to 8,536, and the average holding of each has diminished to four bighas, nineteen biswas, and ten bisw\u00e1nsis. These results, combined with the fact of the almost entire commutation of produce rates into cash payments, point to competition.\n\nRents in kind versus cash payment.\u2014Rents in kind largely prevailed prior to annexation, and were chiefly, if not entirely, levied on poor and unirrigated lands, where the produce was more or less precarious, in the proportion of one-half. Now, however, they have been almost everywhere commuted into money rents; another result of increased numbers and competition.\n\nCompetition.\u2014Custom has not restricted the landlord's right in this matter, nor as regards the enhancement of rent generally. Custom, coupled with the fear of incurring universal odium, operated formerly in preventing a landlord from raising the rents paid by Brahmans. Now, however, such is no longer the case, and it is by no means unusual to find cultivators of this class paying at even double the rates they used to pay in days gone by, their threats of \"dharna\" and self-mutilation or destruction notwithstanding. It is only to be expected that in a densely populated district like this competition should prevail. While custom regulated the transactions between landlord and tenant, prior to the summary settlement of 1858, since that date competition has been gradually displacing, and has now, in most parts of the district, superseded custom; the result, alike of a radical change of government, of greater security to life and property, and of the altered state of the fiscal relation between the landowner and the State. This sounds very much like heresy in the face of Mr. J. S. Mill's emphatically expressed doctrine, that \"competition as a regulator of rent has no existence.\" At the same time he says in another place:\u2014\"The relations, more specially between the landowner and the cultivator, and the payment made by the latter to the former, are, in all states of society, but the most modern\" (the italics are mine), \"determined by the usage of the country. Never until late times have the conditions of the occupancy of land been (as a general rule) an affair of competition.\" Mr. Mill then goes on to cite India as an example in favour of his previous argument, but the analogy, so far as Oudh is concerned, is not established; the system described, although in vogue in other parts of the country, being inapplicable to the now unquestioned tenant status of this province. It has been noticed that the reluctance, which has hitherto been manifested by tenants, to leave their native village with even the certain prospect of bettering themselves elsewhere, is beginning to give way in some places; a fact which is a further indication of the presence of competition, but which is at the same time a healthy sign.\n\nAgricultural labour.\u2014In the present day, when this country is being rapidly opened up to civilization, and its alleged hidden wealth is daily\nundergoing development, the progress and effects of agricultural labour, which in the territorial division of labour has peculiar reference to this province, must be watched with the closest interest. In this district labour is abundant, and at the same time cheap; too cheap in fact, having due regard to the enhanced price of all the necessaries of life, to maintain a just equilibrium between the values exchanged. Skilled labour has doubtless profited by the vicinity of the railroad; and many of the cleverest artizans of the district have long since become almost permanent employees under the East Indian Railway Company, where they obtain far higher wages than local employers could or would allow them. On the other hand, the condition of the unskilled labourers who form the masses has not been ameliorated. Numbers were employed some time back on the railroad, and many still, who live in the more immediate neighbourhood, earn their livelihood by the same means. These, however, compose but a small proportion of the whole and it is proposed to notice the more important and common subdivisions of labour, with the present rates of remuneration accorded to each by the zamindar; to compare these rates with those which prevailed in the nawabi, shortly before annexation, and lastly, to note, as far as possible, the difference between the present and the former prices of the cheaper and lighter food grains, which form the principal subsistence of the poorer classes:\n\n| Description                  | Men.

It may be more and it may be less.\nNow as to the cheaper grains:\n\nBarley sold in the Nawabi at 50 sers, now sells at 33 sers.\nMaize \" \" 32 \" \" 26 \"\nMakra \" \" 40 \" \" 28 \"\nBajra \" \" 30 \" \" 25 \"\nJu\u00e1r \" \" 50 \" \" 35 \"\nKu\u00e1ri dh\u00e1n \" \" 40 \" \" 30 \"\nJoth\u00ed \" \" 40 \" \" 30 \"\nPeas \" \" 40 \" \" 28 \"\nArhar \" \" 50 \" \" 30 \"\n\nThus it will be seen that in some instances the rates of remuneration have only slightly increased since the introduction of British rule. The price of the coarser grains has, however, risen very considerably, and to an extent which is not quite compensated by the amount of enhanced wage. A slight advance on the latter is therefore necessary in order to place these, who are chiefly artizans, on the same footing as they were in the nawabi; while it is evident that the circumstances of the farm labourers are certainly not more straitened than before annexation as regards actual wage.\n\nRelative quantities of seed to the acre.\u2014The amount of seed, of course, varies very much with the nature of the crop to be sown. The following table represents the average requirements per acre for the principal crops:\n\n| Per acre | Broadcast | Drill |\n|----------|-----------|-------|\n| Wheat    |           | 1\u00bd to 2 maunds. |\n| Barley   | 1\u00bd to 2   |       |\n| Peas     | 32 \"sers\" to 1 |       |\n| Gram     | 1\u00bd        | 1\u00bd   |\n| Ku\u00e1ri dh\u00e1n | 1 to 1\u00bd  |       |\n| Jeth\u00ed    | 1 to 1\u00bd   |       |\n| S\u00e1th\u00ed    | 1 to 1\u00bd   |       |\n| Jarhan   | 1 to 1\u00bd   |       |\n| Maize    | 9\u00bd sirs   |       |\n| Bajra    | 3\u00bd to 8\u00bd sers |       |\n| Ju\u00e1r     | 4 to 6    |       |\n| Urd      | 6 to 7    |       |\n| Moth\u00ed    | 4 to 5    |       |\n| Makra    | 2         |       |\n| K\u00e1kun    | \u00bd         |       |\n| Sarson   | 4         | \u00bd ser |\n| S\u00e1uw\u00e1n   |           |       |\n| Sahal    | 1 to 1\u00bd   | maund. |\n| Patwa    | \u00bd sers    |       |\n| Cotton, Kap\u00e1s... | 3\u00bd to 4 sers |       |\n| \" Radhia | 3\u00bd to 4   |       |\n| \" Manwa  | 2\u00bd        |       |\n\nIt is curious to observe here, with reference to barley, peas, and gram, which are sown both broadcast and in drills, that an excess of seed is required for the latter method. In English farming it is just the reverse, broadcast invariably requiring more seed than drill. Wheat is never sown broadcast in this district. It is always sown in drills. A comparison of the quantities of seed required for an acre of wheat and barley in these parts and in England is appended:\u2014\nThe bushel of wheat is calculated as sixty pounds and the bushel of barley as fifty pounds. There is not much difference, it will be observed, between the two rates.\n\n**Village establishment.**\u2014The village officials and the village servants, ordinarily styled the \"parja,\" will now be noticed.\n\n**The patw\u0101r\u012b.**\u2014The patw\u0101r\u012b, or village accountant, is an important functionary, whether viewed in his relations to the landed proprietor, his master, or to Government, who demands from him the periodical submission of the accounts of his charge. These men are entirely K\u0101yaths or K\u0101yath converts to Muhammadanism. In other than taluqdari estates they hold office during the joint pleasure of the landowner and the district officer; that is to say, neither has the power to remove a patw\u0101r\u012b independently of the other. Nevertheless his wages are paid by the former alone, and are usually proportioned to the extent of land under his charge.* A patw\u0101r\u012b's charge varies from a portion of a village to a large circle of several villages. In the latter case, he employs members of his own family or others as assistants, he himself being responsible for their work. The ordinary rate of remuneration is six per cent. on the imperial revenue, and is either paid in cash, or by an allowance of land, which again is either rent-free or charged with a low rent according to circumstances. The patw\u0101ris of this district are, as a rule, an intelligent body of men; but, as might be expected, often dishonest, untruthful, and rapacious. The cultivators live in dread of them, and are ever ready to propitiate them with offerings of grain, &c. Indeed, it is generally noticed that the patw\u0101r\u012b is a sleek, well conditioned man, who lives in one of the best, if not the best house in the village, and wears clothes of a better material than his neighbours. All this could hardly be compassed with his often slender wage, and must be set down to the thriving trade he drives with the ignorant tillers of the soil, in his capacity of village accountant and referee; and, in fact, he does possess a considerable power for good or evil over these unfortunates, who both in court and out of it are so often at his mercy.\n\n**The chaukidar.**\u2014Next to the patw\u0101r\u012b, and but little his inferior in importance in the eyes of the people, is the chaukidar or village watchman. The principal duty of the chaukidar is, of course, the detection and prompt report of crime; but, from the circumstance that though morally\n\n---\n\n* In taluqdari estates the taluqdar has the power to appoint and remove a patw\u0101r\u012b.\nbound to the Government in this capacity, he is, in reality, the paid servant of the landlord, only so far as the latter is alive to a sense of his public responsibilities as a landholder, will the chaukidar prove an efficient servant of the State.\n\nThe gorait.\u2014The gorait has always differed from the chaukidar in as much as he is entirely a private servant as it were of the zamindar. The Government makes no demand on his services. The gorait may be described as a kind of universal errand boy, and, when appointed by the zamindar, is expected to make himself generally useful in the village. In consideration of the modest fee of a ser's weight of grain at harvest time, he undertakes to keep an eye on the cultivators' crops at night. His remuneration from the landlord is usually from one to two bighas of land, rent-free. Both chaukidars and goraits are chiefly of the Pasi class, although a not inconsiderable number of Muhammadans and Chamars may also be found among them.\n\nThe parja.\u2014The following are the village servants which are included in the comprehensive term \"parja\":\n\n| Name          | Occupation                                      |\n|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| Lohar         | Blacksmith.                                     |\n| Barhat        | Carpenter.                                      |\n| Kumbhar       | Potter.                                         |\n| Kahar         | Water-carrier and palanquin-bearer.             |\n| Dhobi         | Washerman.                                      |\n| Darzi         | Tailor.                                         |\n| Hajjam or Nao | Barber.                                         |\n| Bari          | Torch-bearer.                                   |\n| Chamar        | Occasional labourer. The wife is the village accoucheuse. |\n| Mehtar        | Sweeper.                                        |\n| Manihar       | Lac bangle-maker.                               |\n| Mith          | Gardener. Provides flowers for necklaces, and offerings at marriages and fairs. |\n| Tamboli       | P\u00e1n-grower and seller.                          |\n\nRemuneration.\u2014The first three generally receive from the zamindar small grants of land, varying from ten biswas to three bighas, as well as thirteen sers of grain at each harvest. This latter due is styled \"lehna.\" From the cultivators they are entitled to thirteen and a half sers of grain per plough during the year. This is called \"kharifaq.\"\n\nThe Kahar receives from the zamindar from five biswas to two bighas of land, and this is all. He gets no grain allowance, either from the landlord or the tenant.\n\nThe Dhobi has a j\u00e1gir from the zamindar of about the same extent as the Kahar; but he receives in addition a grain allowance of seven sers from each cultivator who employs him.\n\nThe Darzi enjoys a small j\u00e1gir like the two preceding; but has no fixed allowance from the tenants on the estate.\n\nThe Hajjam or Nao is allowed a small plot, not exceeding one bigha, by the landlord; and for each beard (i.e., man) he is entitled to seven sers of grain annually.\nThe B\u0101rhai is uncommon except in taluqdari villages, and his remuneration is on no fixed scale.\n\nThe Cham\u0101r holds up to one bigha of land from the zamindar, while for each occasion of child birth, at which his wife attends, he receives either one or two annas.\n\nThe Mehtar, unfortunately for sanitation, is far too rarely met with amongst the existing roll of village servants. Where kept, he is favoured with a pittance of from two to eight annas a month.\n\nThe Manih\u0101r manufactures lac bangles, and his wife generally sells and fastens them on to the wrists of the purchasers. For the performance of this ceremony at the house of the zamindar she receives her food for the day.\n\nThe M\u0101li obtains cash presents from the zamindar on each festive occasion. These gifts seldom, if ever, exceed three rupees at one time.\n\nThe Tamboli exists entirely by his trade and receives no perquisites.\n\nAll village servants comprised in the category of parja, in addition to the j\u00e1girs, presents, and allowances recapitulated above, receive on the occasion of each marriage one suit of female apparel. The custom of the country is that when a daughter is married, the bridegroom's family supplies the dress to the parja of both villages, since it rarely if ever happens that the bride and bridegroom reside in the same village. Not included in the parja, but nevertheless formerly a regular part of the village establishment was the Baya or weigher. The office is now, however, very nearly obsolete.\n\nStatement showing the details of produce and prices.\n\n| Description of produce | Average |\n|------------------------|---------|\n|                        | 1861   | 1862   | 1863   | 1864   | 1865   | 1866   | 1867   | 1868   | 1869   | 1870   | Of ten years |\n| Paddy                  | 24     | 24     | 24     | 37     | 26     | 22     | 27     | 28     | 26     | 25     | 26\u00bd    |\n| Common rice (husked)   | 20     | 19     | 20     | 17     | 11     | 11     | 17     | 10     | 18     | 16\u00bd    | 16\u00bd    |\n| Best rice (husked)     | 12     | 10     | 15     | 18     | 15     | 8      | 8      | 9      | 8      | 10     | 11\u00bd    |\n| Wheat                  | 21     | 21     | 26     | 26     | 19     | 14     | 21     | 22     | 13     | 14     | 20\u00bd    |\n| Barley                 | 41     | 31     | 36     | 33     | 25     | 19     | 32     | 29     | 13     | 40     | 30\u00bd    |\n| Bajra                  | 34     | 27     | 35     | 20     | 18     | 16     | 27     | 27     | 16     | 18     | 24\u00bd    |\n| Juar                   | 36     | 39     | 36     | 26     | 31     | 17     | 32     | 32     | 16     | 19     | 28\u00bd    |\n| Gram                   | 19     | 22     | 30     | 27     | 23     | 14     | 25     | 30     | 16     | 16     | 22\u00bd    |\n| Arhar (Cytilus cajan)  | 23     | 24     | 22     | 22     | 21     | 11     | 18     | 32     | 18     | 19     | 21\u00bd    |\n| Urd or M\u0101sh (Phaseolus max) | 21     | 23     | 23     | 18     | 19     | 11     | 18     | 24     | 15     | 14     | 18\u00bd    |\n| Mothi (Phaseolus aconitfolius) | 38     | 27     | 36     | 31     | 17     | 16     | 38     | 17     | 15     | 20     | 24\u00bd    |\n| Mung (Phaseolus mungo) | 21     | 22     | 20     | 18     | 18     | 9      | 16     | 17     | 11     | 16     | 16\u00bd    |\n| Mas\u016br (Ervum lens)     | 24     | 16     | 24     | 29     | 20     | 16     | 19     | 19     | 13     | 16     | 20     |\n| Ahsa or matra (Pisum sativum) | ...     | ...     | ...     | ...     | ...     | ...     | ...     | ...     | ...     | ...     | ...     |\n| Ghuiy\u0101n (Arum colocasia) | 30     | 40     | 40     | 50     | 38     | 40     | 40     | 21     | 21     | 21     | 36\u00bd    |\n| Sarson, Sinapis Dichotoma (Roxb) | 22     | 33     | 31     | 24     | 20     | 22     | 29     | 18     | 14     | 18     | 20\u00bd    |\n| L\u0101hi (Ahra Sinapis nigra) | 4     | 4     | 4     | 4     | 4     | 3     | 4     | 4     | 4     | 4     | 3\u00bd    |\n| Raw sugar              | 4      | 4      | 4      | 4      | 4      | 4      | 4      | 4      | 4      | 4      | 4      |\nFish.\u2014The rivers and reservoirs, both natural and artificial, abound with fish. In the former are principally caught the \"rohu,\" the \"anwari\" (Indian mullet), the \"chhalhw\u00e1,\" the \"sahri,\" the \"saur,\" the \"hunga,\" the \"tengr\u00e1,\" the \"singhi,\" the \"belgagra,\" the \"manguri,\" the \"darhi,\" the \"b\u00e1m,\" and the \"parhni.\" The fresh water prawn called \"jhingu\u00e1\" is also very plentiful. With the exception of the \"anwari,\" all the above-mentioned fish may be seen in the \"jhils\" and tanks of the district. In these the fishing season commences with the irrigation in November, and continues till May and June. In the rivers the season is much the same, with this difference, that during the continuance of the first fall of the rains, or in other words, when the river is in flood for the first time in the year, larger quantities of fish are often caught in one week than have been taken during the course of several weeks previously.\n\nKah\u00e1rs are the principal fishermen, and engage in the pursuit as a trade; although at the same time other castes at times adopt the calling. Nets of various shapes and sizes of mesh are used in the different localities; while spearing with the \"pachki\" or tri-furcated spear is also largely resorted to, wherever the water is sufficiently shallow and clear to admit of it.\n\nThe statistics concerning fish, which are given in Dr. Day's report, as derived from the Partabgarh authorities, are as follows:\u2014The fish-eating population amounts to 97\u00b778 per cent. of the whole (Bih\u00e1r). About 40,000 maunds of fish are caught annually (Patti). The net meshes are so small that a grain of barley cannot pass through, the fry is therefore destroyed in large quantities. The markets are not fully supplied; prices of large fish reach two annas per ser, but small fish are sold at one anna per ser; mutton being two annas. The fish are caught in the fields when the water retires from the inundation in September, and in April when the ponds dry up.\n\n\"The Collector of Partabgarh reports that breeding fish and very young ones are destroyed indiscriminately and to a very great extent from April to the end of June and from September to October, wherever they can be captured, in rivers, jhils, tanks, and n\u00e1las, by means of nets, traps, or by hand. The minimum size of the mesh of nets will admit of a corn of barley passing through it, and nothing larger. There is no difficulty in regulating the size of the mesh of nets except the unwillingness of the people to let even the smallest fish escape them, and he proposes at first, as an experiment, to double the size now in use. There can be no objection to prohibiting the sale of the fry of fish in the bazars, or any other reasonable measures being adopted to arrest the senseless destruction of breeding fish and of the very young ones now going on. Some restriction also should be put on the capturing of fish in the breeding season.\"\u2014Para 287, \"Francis Day's Freshwater Fish and Fisheries of India and Burma.\"\n\nThe Tahsildar of Partabgarh observes that fishermen are generally Kah\u00e1rs, but some are Lonias. The markets are not fully supplied with fish, the price of larger sorts is seven pie, smaller sorts four pie, and mutton two annas a ser. About half the population are stated to eat fish. The\nsupply in the waters this year has increased. Very small ones are taken by means of nets. \"Fish are shot with guns, and caught by means of tap, tengali, and pahra, and by hand when the water dries up in the month of Jeth.\"\u2014Para. 309, \"Francis Day's Freshwater Fish and Fisheries of India and Burma.\"\n\n\"The Tahsildar of Bih\u00e1r observes, Kah\u00e1rs and others follow the occupation of fishing in addition to their regular work; besides these, there are Kewats, Kanjars, and P\u00e1sis. The bazars are not sufficiently supplied with fish; the largest sort fetch one anna, the smaller three quarters of an anna a ser; whilst the first sort of mutton realises two annas, and the second one anna and a half a ser. Upwards of 97 per cent. (97.78) of the population, it is asserted, are consumers of fish, the supply of which has increased this year. Very small ones are taken in large quantities by means of nets with very minute meshes, the size of which is equal to a grain of barley. Fish are not trapped during the rains in the inundated fields. The following are the nets used\u2014patli, pahrah, packkhi, tilheri j\u00e1l.\n\n\"In the Patti Tahsil it is observed fishing is not confined to one class, but Kah\u00e1rs, Lonias, Kewats, P\u00e1sis, Kurmis, and Koris, all follow it as well as other occupations. The markets are not fully supplied with fish, the larger sorts obtain two annas, the smaller one anna and a half a ser, and mutton two annas; about half the population are stated to be fish-eaters. The amount in the waters is said to have increased this year. About 40,000 maunds of very small fish are annually netted, the mesh of some of the nets being 'so small that a grain of moth\u00ed cannot pass through it.' Boys generally trap fish in fields during the rains. Fish are destroyed by akhsah; the names of nets and traps are jal, kuryar, halka, chahtur, khore, chaundhi, pahrah, tap, harya, punchkhi, pailni bissarigunj, tameri, kantiya.\"\u2014Para. 308, \"Francis Day's Freshwater Fish and Fisheries of India and Burma.\"\n\nBazars and marts.\u2014The following are the principal bazars of the district, recorded in the order of their importance, chiefly with reference to the aggregate value of the sales.\n\nLalganj.\u2014Four miles to the south of Bih\u00e1r on the road to Allahabad. Total value of sales, Rs. 3,00,000. This is a bi-weekly mart, and is numerously attended. Cattle, English stuffs of better qualities, country fabrics, raw cotton and sugar are amongst the more important sales. The sale dues are shared by the taluqdar of Bhadri and zamindars of Nimd\u00fara, within the limits of which village the ganj is situated.\n\nDerwa bazar, in the village of Sabalgarh, is at the nearest point about three miles distant from the road between Partabgarh and Bih\u00e1r, and is some twelve miles from the latter place. Here again, as in fact is the case with regard to all the larger marts, a bazar is held twice in the week. The total value of the sales is about Rs. 1,50,000. This is principally a grain mart, although other commodities find a ready sale. The bazar dues belong exclusively to the Bhadri estate.\nJalesarganj, included in the village of Dh\u00e1r\u00fapur on the road, which connects the latter place with Lalganj (in pargana R\u00e1mpur), and which was constructed by R\u00e9ja Hanwant Singh. English and country fabrics, sweet-meats, grain, matting, and string figure most prominently at this mart. A very good quality of English cloth is frequently to be met with here, the sale being much encouraged by the abovementioned taluqdar, who, as lord of the manor, is sole recipient of all dues. The value of the sales may be placed at about a lakh of rupees.\n\nMacAndrewganj, the sadr station bazar, is a thriving and rapidly increasing mart. Five years ago the sales were only valued at Rs. 15,000. They have now reached the respectable figure of Rs. 60,000. Grain and English and country cloth are the principal articles traded in. The chungi or bazar tax is paid into the municipal funds.\n\nK\u00e1l\u00e1k\u00e1nkar, the residence of R\u00e9ja Hanwant Singh, on the left bank of the Ganges, is about two miles distant from the Bih\u00e1r and Rae Bareli road. A brisk trade is carried on in raw cotton, gh\u00ed, and salt. The sales exceed in value half a lakh of rupees.\n\nGadew\u00e1ra, a village about six miles north of the sadr station, and not far off the road to Amethi (branching off from the imperial road near Nawabganj). Large quantities of grain are brought here for sale, and a not inconsiderable trade is carried on in coarse matting and fibres. The bazar dues are paid to the Taluqdar of D\u00e1nd\u00edkachh; while the value of the sales may be set down at about Rs. 50,000.\n\nPirht\u00edganj, within the limits of the village of Ram\u00e1epur, in the R\u00e1epur Bichar estate, is close to the road between Bela and the town of Badsh\u00e1hpur in the adjoining district of Jaunpur. Here grain, sugar, cotton, and English stuffs constitute the principal sales, the value of which does not fall short of half a lakh.\n\nNawabganj B\u00e1wan Burji, situated in the village of Murassapur, on the Bih\u00e1r and Rae Bareli road, is an important thriving mart, and is noted for its stamped cloths and chintzes. I have been unable to ascertain correctly the total value of the sales. I believe, however, that in reality it does not fall far short of a lakh of rupees. There are several other less important markets, in which local produce is chiefly represented, which it would serve no useful purpose to detail in this report.\n\nFairs.\u2014There are several local fairs held during the year at different places in the district. Few of these are worthy of separate mention. The two fairs held at M\u00e1nikpur in April and July in honour of Jw\u00e1la Mukhi* attract considerable numbers, many of whom come from a distance. The gathering on each occasion lasts for two days, during which the presiding deity is worshipped and propitiated with offerings, &c. Both at these fairs, and during the bathing assemblies described in the next paragraph, English cloths and articles of foreign manufacture are exposed for sale. At Katra Mednisigh, a place about a mile from Partabgarh, and at Nawabganj B\u00e1wan Burji, which has been already mentioned, fairs take place during the Dasahra festival, which are attended by between 40,000 and 50,000 people, but no trade is carried on.\n\n* Meaning flame-emitting mouths: one of the impersonations of the goddess Bhaw\u00e1ni.\nBathing places and shrines.\u2014The only bathing places of any note are the masonry gh\u00e1ts of M\u00e1nikpur and Shah\u00e1b-ud-d\u00ednabad, The two towns being contiguous form in reality but one rendezvous. Twice in the year there is a large concourse of people at this spot for the purpose of bathing in the Ganges. In July is the first occasion, when the four months' fasts for the deities Jw\u00e1la Mukhi and S\u00edtla* are brought to a termination with bathing ceremonies and great rejoicings. The second occasion occurs early in November, or at the end of October, when the multitudes meet to do honour to the goddess Ganga herself. This is the larger gathering of the two.\n\nManufactures.\u2014With the exception of the manufacture of crystalized sugar at Partabgarh, and of glass at Saw\u00e1nsa, and one or two other places in the pargana of Patti, there are no local manufactures worthy of the name.\n\nThe sugar manufactured at Partabgarh is of excellent quality, and is not to be found anywhere else. The process is a peculiar though by no means a difficult one. When completed, the sugar is turned out into thin flat circular shapes of about 15 inches in diameter. It finds a ready sale amongst the taluqdars and wealthier classes.\n\nThe glass foundry at Saw\u00e1nsa is on a comparatively large scale, and supplies most of the neighbouring fairs and markets with beads, bracelets, and other female ornaments, to say nothing of Ganges water phials and cheap articles of ordinary requirements.\n\nTrade and traffic.\u2014From the most recent trade returns it would appear that the total value of the exports nearly quadruples that of the imports, but I have reason to doubt the accuracy of the valuation of some of the items of the former, and consequently prefer to regard the proportion as in all probability nearer three to one. Partabgarh is an extensive grain exporting district, and may be said to be, to a great extent, the granary of the adjacent districts of the North-Western Provinces. Of wheat and barley alone upwards of 200,000 maunds are stated to have left the district during the last year; while of the less valuable food grains also a very considerable exportation has taken place. This should represent large money returns to zamindars and small farmers; but I have reason to believe that it is almost entirely the bani\u00e1n and village banker who fatten on this trade. The former classes are, as a rule, too deep in the books of the latter to reap any direct advantage. Nevertheless, we have the fact of an influx of money and a consequent increase of private capital, which, in whomsoever's hands, subserves no doubt the prosperity of the district, and tends to the ultimate benefit of the population. The exports of edible grains in 1872 are reported at 349,000 maunds, value Rs. 7,90,000; the other exports, such as oil-seeds, sugar, tobacco, and country cloth, make up the total value of exports to Rs. 9,77,000, the imports were valued at Rs. 4,08,000, of which cotton and salt are the principal items; but in these returns English piece-goods imported are valued at Rs. 2,670; it should probably be Rs. 2,67,000.\n\n* Also an incarnation of Bhaw\u00e1ni and tutelary deity of small-pox.\nExports and imports.\u2014Besides grain, opium, tobacco, sugar, and molasses, oil, and ghi, cattle, sheep, and timber are by no means unimportant staples of export trade. On the other hand, the imports consist mainly of salt, cotton, metals, and hardware, country cloth, and dyes. English stuffs and piece-goods are also becoming more and more common in the local bazars. All the above almost entirely find their way into the district from the opposite side of the Ganges. The traffic by way of the adjoining districts of Jaunpur on the east, and of Sultanpur and Rae Bareli on the north and west respectively is, comparatively speaking, inconsiderable.\n\nIn connection with this subject, Mr. King writes as follows:\n\n\"It may not be out of place here to suggest what new roads should be made, and to show the direction which traffic takes in this district. Oudh exports grain, oil-seed, sugar, and tobacco, some timber and little beside. These mainly go in a south-east direction towards Gorakhpur, Azamgarh, Jaunpur, and Mirzapur. Lines drawn from the north-west to the south-east of Oudh will mainly represent the direction in which produce moves. Of course, I am speaking in general terms. Roads will often be diverted owing to the presence or absence of a ferry or other cause. Imports into Oudh are chiefly salt, cotton, English cloth, and other miscellaneous matters. Salt and cotton come in by western and south-western routes from Cawnpore, Banda, &c.\n\n\"In the Partabgarh district, the main Ganges ferries, where this traffic passes, are Badshahpur, Kharoli,* K\u00e1l\u00e1k\u00e1nkar, Gutn\u00ed, and Jah\u00e1nabad; and at all of these traffic-registrars are placed. The traffic from this quarter finds a sufficiency of routes to the interior of Oudh by tolerable roads, but the out traffic wants a channel towards Jaunpur, and a new road should be opened out from Patti to the border of the district somewhere about R\u00e1ja-ka-baz\u00e1r in the Parhat estate of R\u00e1ja Mahesh Narain, and, in communication with the Jaunpur authorities, be carried on so as to reach Jaunpur.\"\n\nMineral products.\u2014This branch may be said to comprise salt, saltpetre, and kankar. There is a considerable area of saliferous land in the Partabgarh district.\n\nSalt.\u2014The manufacture of salt in Oudh is punishable under the excise laws. The following salt statistics furnished by Mr. King are interesting. After remarking that as an article of food it was formerly \"extensively manufactured in this district, and that the annual value of the manufacture to the native government, or farmer, was Rs. 72,000,\" my predecessor writes:\n\n\"Mr. Braddon, Superintendent of Excise and Stamps, in a pamphlet on Oudh salt, gives the area of salt-producing lands in Partabgarh, thus:\n\n| Highly saliferous | ... | ... | ... | 3,287 |\n| Moderately       | ... | ... | ... | 1,121 |\n| Total            |     |     |     | 4,408 |\n\n* This is close to the Kandr\u00e1wan or Naubasta ferry and is of far less importance than the latter.\n\"He gives the revenue derived from salt in 1856 as Rs. 61,496. In 1859 the revenue from salt was, as reported by the Chief Commissioner to the Government of India, Rs. 68,022 for Partabgarh. I fancy that in neither year was the revenue what it should have been, and there can be no doubt that, as experience was gained, the salt department would have been enabled to collect a considerably higher figure than Rs. 72,000, which, under the native government, were paid by the landowners on account of salt lands. I will not digress into the question of salt manufacture, whether it should or should not be allowed in Oudh, nor, indeed, say more than that I have from the first held the belief, that it is on the whole impolitic to stop the trade.\"\n\nSaltpetre.\u2014The manufacture of this substance was carried on in this district until about a year and a half ago. The manufacture was put a stop to, because it was discovered that it afforded too many facilities for engaging in the illicit preparation of edible salt.\n\nUsar.\u2014This earth is to be found principally in the R\u00e1mpur pargana of the Kunda tahsil. It has been generally regarded as unproductive, but in later times it has in some places been made to yield a crop of rice by filtration of the top soil. This is effected by confining the water in the rainy season in low-lying localities by means of an embankment. After two or three years of this process, the earth becomes freed from the presence of its deleterious components, and rice can be sown in it. Such lands may be then regarded as permanently reclaimed, and in a very few years come up to the standard of average rice lands. The analysis of the different \u00fasar soils, which are met with in Oudh, will be found at length in Mr. Maconochie's report on the settlement of the Unao district.\n\nReh.\u2014Regarding reh, I cannot do better than transcribe Mr. King's remarks:\u2014\"In many places that efflorescence of the earth known as reh is to be found. I give the results of a chemical analysis of it, which appeared in the Times of India in 1864:\n\n\"Soda\" ... ... ... ... ... ... 28 parts.\n\"Sulphuric acid\" ... ... ... ... ... ... 17 parts.\n\n\"Potass, lime, magnesia, carbonic acid, and silica form the rest of the mass. It is used by dhobis in washing, and by makers of cheap lac bangles.\"\n\nKankar.\u2014The conglomerate known as \"kankar,\" and which is composed principally of carbonate of lime, with a variable proportion of silica, is common enough in this part of the country. It is mainly used for metalling roads, and for this purpose it is extensively quarried in this district. I have been informed by Dr. Whishaw, Officiating Sanitary Commissioner of Oudh, that the presence of reh efflorescence on the surface of the ground is a sure indication of the existence of kankar formation below.\n\nAnimal products (wool).\u2014The animal products of the district may be said to consist entirely of wool, hides, horns, and ghi. There is an excellent breed of sheep in the Kunda Tahsil, which furnishes the best wool\nThe sheep are shorn three times in the course of the year\u2014viz., in the months of As\u00e1rh (June-July), K\u00e1rtik (October-November), and Ph\u00e1gun (February-March). The heaviest fleece falls to the K\u00e1rtik shearing, and the lightest in Ph\u00e1gun. The annual weight of wool yielded by a single sheep varies from one and a half to two and a half pounds. About two pounds represents a fair average, and this quantity is consumed in the manufacture of the small blanket \"kamli\" of such universal use. The average price of these small blankets is now twelve annas. That of the larger ones \"kammal\" Re. 1-10-0. Of the former, about ten years ago, two could be purchased for the rupee; while a good heavy blanket of the larger description could be had for the same sum.\n\nIn this district the shepherds themselves manufacture the wool into blankets. It is on this account that wool is not much exported as a staple. The \"baip\u00e1ris\" or itinerant traders drive a brisk trade with the shepherds of Bih\u00e1r. About the month of June the shepherds receive advances of money from the baip\u00e1ris, and by the end of October or beginning of November the blankets are ready, when the purchasers come and carry them off. These traders chiefly come from Jaunpur, Azamgarh, and Gorakhpur.\n\nHides and horns.\u2014Hides and horns are principally exported from the Salon tahsil.* This is probably attributable to the fact of there being a larger Muhammadan population here than in other parts of the district, and in consequence a greater consumption of animal food. This trade goes entirely across the Ganges. In return prepared skins are imported from Cawnpore and Allahabad which are manufactured into the \"moths\" or leathern buckets used for wells, and also into the coarser kinds of native shoes.\n\nGhi.\u2014Ghi is extensively prepared and consumed in the district of Par-tabgarh, and forms by no means an unimportant item of trade. The export of this article largely exceeds the import; at the same time that the quality of the latter is very much inferior to that of the former.\n\n**Detail of Exports and Imports for 1873.**\n\n| Article                  | Quantity | Value | Article                  | Quantity | Value |\n|--------------------------|----------|-------|--------------------------|----------|-------|\n| Sugar                    | 2,358    | 23,732| Cotton cleaned           | 4,275    | 89,067|\n| Gar                      | 7,953    | 23,308| Do, uncleaned            | 864      | 14,688|\n| Spices                   | 548      | 6,722 | Sugar                    | 1,135    | 8,670 |\n| Wheat                    | 84,837   | 9,19,937| Edible grains            | 6,55,175| 5,351 |\n| Edible grains            | 3,05,971 |       | Salt                     | 23,070   | 1,19,283|\n| Lac                      | 330      | 9,019 | Metals and hardware      |          | 69,375|\n| Opium                    | 1,720    | 11,300| ware.                    |          |       |\n| Salt                     | 1,122    | 5,748 | English piece-goods      |          | 8,260 |\n| Oi seeds                 | 9,886    | 83,696| European miscellaneous   |          | 68,731|\n| Horned cattle            | 1,700    | 10,948| goods.                   |          |       |\n| Firewood                 |          | 8,050 |                          |          |       |\n| Country cloth and        |          | 13,940|                          |          |       |\n| materials                |          |       |                          |          |       |\n| Ghi                      |          | 12,390|                          |          |       |\n| Oil                      |          | 6,475 |                          |          |       |\n| **Total**                |          | 1,055,620| **Total**               |          | 4,05,691|\n\n* Now included in the Rae Bareli district.\nFerries.\u2014For about eight months of the year the Sai is in most places easily fordable. During the rainy season, when the stream rises, the zamindars along the banks make their own arrangements, by which boats are available for the crossing of foot-passengers at no less than thirty points. The only available crossing for animals and wheeled traffic during the rains is over the recently built masonry bridge at Bela. Two ferries under the administration of the Deputy Commissioner of Partabgarh ply on that portion of the Gumti which forms the boundary of the district, and are farmed at an annual income of Rs. 325. Each is distant from the other about one mile only. That known as the Birshimpur ferry is a landing and lading station for traffic carried along the Patti road, which meets the imperial road between Fyzabad and Allahabad at a village called Nawabganj, two and a half miles from the sadr bazar, also for traffic traversing the Jaunpur and Sultanpur road, which intersects the former road at the village of Sonpura, about two miles from the ferry. The other ferry within the limits, on this side of the village Mahraura, has been for some time past used only as a passenger ferry, and the traffic registrar has been lately removed from the spot.\n\nGanges ferries.\u2014There are several ferries on the Ganges within the limits of this district. I shall mention the principal ones only. The highest is the K\u00e1lak\u00e1nkar ferry, which is a considerable grain lading station. Below this again, some four miles or so, is the M\u00e1nikpur ferry, which is kept for passenger traffic principally. Proceeding almost due south for another five miles we come to Gutni, another passenger ferry. Lastly, at a distance of some ten miles further on is the Jah\u00e1nabad ferry, which is likewise kept more for the convenience of foot passengers than for goods traffic. All these ferries are under the administration of the North-Western Provinces authorities.*\n\nRoads, bridges, and traffic.\u2014The district is now well opened up by roads. Exclusive of twenty-two and a half miles of the imperial road, which connects the military stations of Fyzabad and Allahabad, and which passes through the headquarters, there are 342 miles of good second class roads. These have been entirely bridged, save at four points only, where the Sai, Sakru, Pareya, and Bakl\u00e1hi respectively require large and solid masonry bridges to withstand the opposing force of the current in the rains, each of which will necessitate some amount of delay, to say nothing of money. My predecessor's remarks on the roads and traffic of the district here find a suitable place.\n\n\"General roads.\u2014There is but one first-class road in this district, viz., that one which runs from Fyzabad to Allahabad. This was begun soon after the re-conquest of the province, and is a military road joining the two cantonments named above, which are ninety-six miles apart. There are only twenty-two and a half miles of this road in the Partabgarh district, which it traverses in its breadth, entering it at the village of Dharodi, and leaving it at the village of Dehl\u00edpur. There are two road bungalows, one at Bela, and one at Bikn\u00e1pur, some eleven miles\n\n* The receipts are divided in the proportion of 60 per cent. to the North-Western Provinces and 40 per cent. to Oudh.\napart. The road is metalled throughout from the Ganges bank to Fyzabad, saving the river Sai at Bela.*\n\n\"District roads.\u2014There is a very good network of country roads in the district, and the principal are the following:\u2014\n\n\"(1.) From Rae Bareli to the headquarters station at Bela. Forty-four miles of it lie in this district, and it passes through the tahsil of Salon, the bazar of Lalganj, and the town of Partabgarh. This road is bridged save over the two streams of the Loni\u2020 and Sakarni, the former ten and a quarter and the latter five and a quarter miles from Bela.\n\n\"(2.) From Bela to Gutni Gh\u00e1t on the Ganges, thirty-nine miles. This passes through Partabgarh, three miles from Bela, and through the tahsil of Bih\u00e1r, twenty-nine and a half miles from Bela, and through the bazar of Kunda, six miles from Bihar.\n\n\"(3.) From Bela to Patti, fifteen and a half miles, crossing the Sai by the Fyzabad and Allahabad road, which it leaves about a mile north of the river at the Nawabganj bazar for Patti, thirteen miles distant. This road continues through Saifabad, eight miles from Patti on the north, to the town of Chanda (in the Sultanpur district), which is twelve miles from Patti.\n\n\"(4.) Bela to B\u00e9dsh\u00e1hpur in the Jaunpur district, twenty-one miles, some twenty miles being in this district. The road passes by the R\u00e1mganj th\u00e1na in the village of Pachhr\u00e1o.\n\n\"(5.) A road from Rae Bareli passing through Jagatpur T\u00e1nghan enters the Salon tahsil, and passing through Mustafabad, Nawabganj, B\u00e1wan-Burji, M\u00e1nikpur, and KundaleavesthedistrictatLalganjintheBih\u00e1r tahsil.\"\n\nAllahabad.\u2014This is the most direct road from Lucknow to Allahabad. There are other minor roads, which do not call for particular description e.g.,\u2014\n\n6. Salon to Ateha, 12 miles.\n7. Salon to Dalmau Gh\u00e1t in Rae Bareli district, 24 miles.\n8. Salon to Naubasta Gh\u00e1t on the Ganges, 16 miles.\n9. Salon to M\u00e1nikpur, 18 miles.\n10. Salon to Lalganj on the Allahabad border, vid Bih\u00e1r, 28 miles.\n11. Salon to Lalganj (in pargana R\u00e1mpur) to Ateha, 12 miles.\n12. Bela to Amethi vid Nawabganj, 24 miles.\n13. Bela to Katra, 8 miles.\n14. Patti tahsil to R\u00e1mganj th\u00e1na, 14 miles.\n\n* In August, 1868, a large and handsome masonry bridge of nine arches and forty-five feet span was opened for traffic over the Sai at Bela Gh\u00e1t. It was built under the immediate superintendence of the late Mr. D. Turner, Civil Engineer.\n\n\u2020 Since Mr. King wrote the above, a fine masonry bridge has been completed over the Loni of five arches, with a span of twenty-five feet.\nThe imperial road from Fyzabad to Allahabad passes through this district and through the chief town of Bela. It passes for $22\\frac{1}{2}$ miles throughout this district and the stages are\u2014\n\nChera $9\\frac{1}{2}$ miles from Bela on Sultanpur side, then Bela itself, and Kar\u00e1ni, 12 miles from the latter place.

Number of n\u00e1las 2.\n\nCarriage.\u2014Wheeled carriage is scarce and difficult to procure. A few country carts are detainable in and near the sadr station, also in places in the Kunda tahsil. Great reluctance is everywhere manifested by the owners to hiring out their carriage, and when it is known that troops are on the move, and that carriage will be impressed, the carts are frequently taken to pieces, and the latter concealed in different houses, the bullocks at the same time being sent to a neighbouring village. Bullocks, buffaloes, and ponies afford the ordinary means of transport. The bullock is capable of carrying a load of from three to three and a half maunds; a buffalo about five maunds; while the usual load of the country pony or tatt\u00fa seldom exceeds one and a half maunds.\nCHAPTER III.\n\nTHE PEOPLE.\n\nPopulation\u2014Muhammadan settlements, Sunnis, Shias\u2014Hindu population, Brahmans, Chhattris, landed proprietors, Valahyas, K\u00e1yaths\u2014Aboriginal tribes\u2014Houses\u2014Food\u2014Dress and ornaments\u2014Tenures\u2014Rural Customs\u2014Proprietary Rights\u2014List of Taluq-dars.\n\nPopulation.\u2014A census of the population of the province was taken on the 1st February, 1869, and the results have been tabulated and reported on by Mr. J. C. Williams, Assistant Commissioner.\n\nFrom the appendices to his report it will be seen, that the entire population of this district on the night of the census amounted to 936,268 souls, which gives a proportion of 540 to the square mile. The most densely populated parts were parganas Partabgarh, M\u00e1nikpur, and Parsh\u00e1depur; and the population was thinnest in pargana R\u00e1mpur, where it was only 433 to the square mile.\n\nSince the census, however, there has been a redistribution of territory and Partabgarh has lost two of its parganas. The present population will be found in the following tables:\u2014\n## Area and population.\n\n### POPULATION.\n\n| Division | Hindu | Agricultural | Non-agricultural | Muhammadans and other not

Muhammadans.\u2014The district may be said to be peopled by Hindus; the proportion of the latter to Muhammadans, and others not Hindus (the number of the latter is insignificant) being 11:27 to 1. This large preponderance of Hindus appears to be common to the greater portion of the province of Oudh, the exceptions being the central districts of Lucknow, Bara Banki, and Sitapur.\n\nI have shown in the margin the varying ratios for each district of the province. It is a curious fact, that the districts of Rae Bareli and Lucknow, which are contiguous, should respectively exhibit the highest and lowest proportion. Looking at the map, it would seem, that the larger preponderance is in the border districts, that is, in those adjoining the older provinces of the north-west,* while of these again the preponderance is highest in the four districts which are bounded by the Ganges. The remaining four districts\u2020 form the heart of Oudh, and are enclosed on the north by the Naip\u00e1l range: no doubt it was this portion of the country on which the Muhammadan conquerors established a stronger and more lasting hold, as is evident by there being more of their large towns, \u201cqasbas,\u201d and religious endowments than elsewhere.\n\nMuhammadan settlements.\u2014The Muhammadan conquerors established seats of government at Lucknow and Fyzabad; near the latter place, which for many years was the capital of Oudh, is the famous shrine of Ajodhya, and it is no doubt to be inferred that many of the vast numbers of Hindus annually attracted thither in course of time settled in the adjacent country; and while thus largely increasing the population of the pargana of Haweli Oudh\u2021 and of the district of Fyzabad\u00a7 generally, counteracted the numerical influence of the rising Muhammadan settlement. After a time, too, the capital was transferred from Fyzabad to Lucknow. Thus the seat of government at Lucknow came to be, in a sense, the sole centre, around and within a certain radius of which others and more or less powerful Muhammadan settlements sprung up. These served to keep in check the surrounding Hindu communities, little disposed though the latter seem to have been to offer serious molestation to the invader. As time wore on, it would appear that those settlements and families which were furthest removed from the influence of the reigning head, and the benefits of court alliances, gradually decayed, were supplanted, or removed elsewhere. Mr. J. C. Williams, C.S., in para. 125 of his census report, lays it down \u201cas a general rule, that Muhammadan influence is strong, their lands extensive, and their numbers, among the population great, in exactly inverse proportion to the influence, numbers and territorial possessions of the great Rajput clans,\u201d and to this, in a general sense, I subscribe.\n\n* i.e., Kheri, Hardoi, Unao, Rae Bareli, Partabgarh, Sultanpur, Fyzabad, and Gonda.\n\u2020 i.e., Lucknow, Bara Banki, Sitapur, and Bahraich.\n\u2021 1,042 to the square mile.\n\u00a7 616 to the square mile.\nDistribution of Muhammadans.\u2014The followers of the Prophet are, in this district, most numerous in the parganas of M\u00e1nikpur, Partabgarh, and Bih\u00e1r; and least so in parganas Dhingwas and R\u00e1mpur. They are nearly evenly divided between agricultural and non-agricultural; the former slightly preponderating. The higher castes are almost entirely confined to Shekhs and Path\u00e1s. The Muhammadan converts from higher castes of Hindus number only 534. Of the lower castes who for the most part pursue some distinctive trade, the \"jul\u00e1ha\" or weaver, the \"dhunia\" or cotton corder, the \"darzi\" or tailor and tent maker, the \"manih\u00e1r\" or lac-bangle maker (who also colours but does not manufacture glass-bangles), and the kunjra or fruiterer, predominate.\n\nSunnis and Shias.\u2014No distinct enumeration was made at the last census of the respective professors of the Sunni and Shia faiths. The latter, however, is principally confined to families of pure descent; while the followers of Sunni persuasion are undoubtedly far the most numerous over the whole Muhammadan population. The Shia faith came no doubt from Persia, and I cannot but believe that its importation dates from the written promise of Hum\u00e1y\u00fan in the famous interview with the Q\u00e1zi of Sh\u00e1h Tuhm\u00e1sp. \"Though the Shias and Sunnis,\" says Elphinstone, \"differ less than Catholics and Protestants, their mutual animosity is much more bitter.\"\n\nHindu population.\u2014Of the Hindu population, about 70 per cent. are tillers of the soil, and this proportion is pretty evenly maintained in each pargana. Brahmans, Chhattirs, Vaishyas, and K\u00e1yaths almost exclusively compose the higher castes. Of the lower castes Ah\u00edrs, Kurmis, Cham\u00e1rs, and P\u00e1s\u00eds predominate; at the same time there is a good sprinkling of Mur\u00e1os. Kurmis and Mur\u00e1os, who may be styled cultivators of the first class, are almost to a man agriculturists in this district; and in regard to the number of the former, the Partabgarh district ranks second in the province. The majority of the Ah\u00edrs, Cham\u00e1rs, P\u00e1s\u00eds, and Garerias, who are all second-rate cultivators, are also wedded to the soil. There are more Loh\u00e1rs and Loni\u00e1s in this district than in any other in Oudh; but very few of the former, comparatively speaking, are engaged in agricultural pursuits. The latter have, as it were, embraced a new profession, and are almost exclusively cultivators, now that their normal occupation has gone. As agriculturists they rank high, and are much sought after.\n\nBrahmans.\u2014The Brahmins are chiefly composed of the subdivision known as Sarwaria. There are a few Kanaujias proper, Gaur Brahmins, and San\u00e1dhs here and there. Unfortunately the census papers do not give numerical details of these subdivisions. The Kanaujia is less of a stickler for his dignity than the Sarwaria; for the former may frequently be seen driving and carrying his own plough, while the latter invariably employs a ploughman. It may therefore be reasonably inferred that the Kanaujia is better off, in a worldly point of view, than his prouder and greater ease-loving brother. The Sarwaria nevertheless looks well after\n\n*In this district a large proportion of Cham\u00e1rs carry palanquins, and seem to have usurped the hereditary trade of the Kah\u00e1r.\nhis interests, and is in general a good cultivator and solvent tenant. While however the latter will never drive or carry the plough, he may be frequently seen mounted on and driving the \"hinga\" or harrow, and using other agricultural implements.\n\nGradual change in their mode of life.\u2014The sh\u00e1stars forbid all active employment and labour of every description. The Brahman is expected to pass his life in contemplation, and to support himself by the gleanings of the field and grain market, and by alms-begging. In the second period of his existence, as Elphinstone writes, \"when the regular sources fail, a Brahman may, for a mere subsistence, glean or beg, or cultivate, or even (in case of extreme necessity) he may trade.\" Cases of \"extreme necessity\" must, however, have become very frequent of late, judging from the number of Brahman money-lenders and traders one meets with. A highly respectable and intelligent pandit recently informed me, that since 1857 far more laxity in the observance of tenets has prevailed amongst Brahmans than formerly; and he dared not say how it would end. In Oudh, he observed, prior to British rule the Brahman youth of the country devoted themselves to the reading and study of the sacred writings, and nearly every qualified student might reasonably look forward to a post of greater or less honour and emolument, as spiritual adviser, or private chaplain, in a taluqdar's or other wealthy family. Latterly, however, the demand for the article having declined, the supply has almost stopped, and it is now the exception (my informant told me) to find any respectable young Brahman conversant with the Vedas.* It must have become palpable to all but the most careless observer, how great has been the progress of late in the quiet and gradual though sure undermining of the vast edifice of caste prejudice and superstition owing to the nearer advance of civilizing influences and extended education.\n\nSpurious Brahmans.\u2014In the M\u00e1nikpur and Bih\u00e1r parganas there are a great many families of the spurious Brahmans, whose ancestors belonged to the lower castes of Hindus, and who were to the extent of 125,000, it is said, invested with the sacred thread by order of R\u00e1ja M\u00e1nik Chand, of M\u00e1nikpur celebrity. 28,370 acres of the soil of this district are in the proprietorship of Brahmans, for which they pay a yearly revenue of Rs. 30,631 to the State. There is no Brahman Taluqdar in the Partabgarh district, but this class hold fifty-one villages and hamlets in sub-settlement.\n\nChhatris.\u2014The number of Chhatris in the district, according to the last census, is almost exactly half that of the Brahmans. The four principal classes of landed proprietors are Bachgotis, Sombansis, Bisens, and Kanhpurias, and the possessions of these are very approximately co-extensive with the boundaries of the four tahsil subdivisions.\n\nIt is much to be regretted, with reference to the Chhattri population also, that so large a proportion as 30\u00b77 per cent. of the whole should have been returned in the census papers without a detail of the clans they\n\n* Mr. P. Carnegy, in his admirable \"Notes on the Races, Tribes, and Castes of Oudh,\" records that on questioning one of the Gaur Brahmans in charge of the Jain temples at Ajodhya about his lax religious views, the latter told him he would not take charge of a church even if he were paid for it.\nbelonged to. Of the detailed percentage, it appears that the Sombansi is the most numerous; then the Bachgoti, the Bais, the Kanhpuria, and the Bisen; but the absence of detail in the whole, of course, renders any calculation based on the above fractional data very liable to considerable error. The Bais of this district are not the Tilokchandi Bais of Baiswara, but come of an inferior stock, and go by the name of Kath bais. They are of course not recognized by the former. At the same time I entirely concur in Mr. Carnegy's argument, that the Bais have but little to boast of in comparison with other Rajput tribes, as regards either antiquity or purity of religion and descent. There is another Bais family in Itaura in the Salon pargana who call themselves Bais chaudhri.*\n\nChhatri landed proprietors.\u2014I append a statement showing the distribution of zamindari rights in mauzas and hamlets,\u2020 as vested at present in the different Rajput clans of the district:\n\n| Clan          | Taluqdari villages | Zamindari villages | Villages held in sub-settlement |\n|---------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Bachgoti      | 683                | 35                 | 14                              |\n| Sombansi      | 360                | 154                | 85                              |\n| Bisen         | 532                | 70                 | 54                              |\n| Kanhpuria     | 120                | 128                | 41                              |\n| Dirgbanj      | 15                 |                    |                                 |\n| Bilkaria      | 4                  | 21                 | 5                               |\n| Gautam        | 8                  | 7                  | 9                               |\n| Bais (Kath Bais) | ...              | 4                  | 47                              |\n| Bais (Chaudhri) | ...              | 8                  | 2                               |\n| Ralkwar       |                    | 2                  |                                 |\n| Chandel       |                    | 9                  |                                 |\n| Bach          |                    | 1                  |                                 |\n| Kajkum\u00e1r      |                    | 2                  |                                 |\n| Amethia       |                    | 1                  |                                 |\n| Gharwar       |                    |                    |                                 |\n| Khagal        |                    |                    |                                 |\n| Kosik         |                    |                    |                                 |\n| Parihar       |                    |                    |                                 |\n| Mungarha      |                    |                    |                                 |\n\nTotal 1,732 387 262\n\nThe most extensive proprietors are the Bachgotis, next come the Bisens, then the Sombansis, and lastly the Kanhpurias. After these, the holdings of the remaining Rajput tribes are comparatively insignificant, and call for no special remarks.\n\nVaishyas.\u2014The Vaishyas represent the Bani\u00e1n or chief trading class of the district. The Agarwala is rarely met with; the Baranwala more frequently. Another subdivision, the Sardwak, also professing the Jain religion (but not alluded to by Mr. Williams in his census report), exists in small numbers. The most common sects are perhaps the Agrahri and Ajodhya-bashi in tahsils Partabgarh and\n\n* I have, I am sorry to say, been unable to discover the origin and history of these two families of the Bais.\n\n\u2020 In the old district.\nBihar, and Omar in tahsil Patti. These sects are entirely distinct, and neither eat and drink together, nor intermarry. I have heard it alleged (and the story is current, I believe, in parts of the Punjab), that once upon a time a certain raja had two daughters, named Ch\u00e1mu and B\u00e1mu. These married, and each gave birth to a son, who in time grew up to be pahlw\u00e1ns or prodigies of strength. An elephant happened to die on the raja's premises, and being unwilling that the carcass should be cut up and disposed of piece-meal within the precincts of his abode, he sought for a man of sufficient strength to carry it forth whole and bury it. Ch\u00e1mu's son undertook and successfully performed this marvellous feat. The son of B\u00e1mu, stirred no doubt by jealousy, professed to regard this act with righteous horror, (personal contact with a corpse or dead animal amounting to defilement), and he thereupon broke off all relations with his cousin, and pronounced him an outcast. Ch\u00e1mu's are asserted to be descendants of the latter, and Bani\u00e1s of the former, and hence the former in some parts, though admitting their moral degradation, have been known to assert that they are in reality possessed of a higher rank in the social scale than the latter.\n\nK\u00e1yaths.\u2014The K\u00e1yaths are chiefly of the Srib\u00e1stab and Saksena branches, a few of the M\u00e1thur and Amisht being interspersed among them. All the q\u00e1n\u00fangos in the district are Srib\u00e1stab. There are no K\u00e1yath taluqdars, but the large muh\u00e1ls of Ch\u00e1ch\u00e1mau and Salempur Bhairon belong to this class, who own altogether sixty-five villages and hamlets. The greater portion of the K\u00e1yath population are in service as patw\u00e1ris, agents, writers, &c., at the same time, a not inconsiderable proportion are addicted to agricultural pursuits. In his census report Mr. J. C. Williams, C.S., remarks that the Saksenas have two sub-castes called Khare and D\u00fasre. This favours the supposition that the Saksenas alone of the twelve sects possess these two subdivisions, whereas the Khare and D\u00fasre sub-sects are common to all. The origin of these sub-sects is thus traced by the K\u00e1yaths of this district. The twelve brothers, the founders of the twelve branches of K\u00e1yath families, married each the daughter of a deity (deota). Hearing this, the demons (R\u00e1chchhas) determined not to be outdone, and persuaded each of the brothers to take to wife a R\u00e1chchhas daughter also. The descendants of the deity came to be known as D\u00fasre and those of the demon as Khare (Sanskrit alias for R\u00e1chchhas).\n\nProportion of females to males.\u2014The percentage of females on males as taken on the entire population is 96\u00b79. In this respect the district of Partabgarh stands third in the province: the other two districts of the division, viz., Rae Bareli and Sultanpur, being respectively first and second. The same order is maintained on taking the percentage on the Hindu population only, and a further analysis of the agricultural and non-agricultural statistics of the Hindu community, as exhibited in Table I. of the Oudh Census Report, affords details of adults and children. The proportion is almost invariably lowest among the agricultural classes; but as this seems to be in the main the case also with regard to the Muhammadan\npopulation of the province any argument based hereon, in favour of the prevalence of infanticide amongst the Hindu agricultural classes, at once loses force. In fact the census figures are opposed to the idea of the existence of the crime, in the light of even a partially prevailing custom; and from my own enquiries in this, and the adjoining district of Sultanpur, I incline to the belief that the practice has become all but obsolete. Of the Rajput clans of this district, who were the principal offenders in this respect, the Bachgoti and Sombansi may be prominently mentioned. Unlike his more aristocratic congener of Baiswara, the lower Bais or Kath Bais, of the Bihar and Salon tahsils, has never, I believe, been addicted to the habit. The Bisen and Kanhpuria likewise deny all former participation in infanticide, but with what truth I have been unable to ascertain with any degree of certainty.\n\n**Houses.\u2014**The ordinary habitation of the peasantry consists of four rooms built in this wise:\u2014Four outer clay walls are run up in the shape of a parallelogram, the longest sides running north and south, according to the teaching of the Shastras.\n\nWithin these walls and parallel to them, at a distance of from seven to ten feet, four more walls are built up to the same height. The two sets of walls are then covered over with common thatch (khas posh), and thus they form, with the aid of divisions, either four or eight rooms (kothris), with an inner enclosure or courtyard called \"angan\" or \"agnadi.\" A ground plan will perhaps convey the best idea of the houses most commonly seen:\u2014\n\n[Diagram of a house with labels \"Angan\" or \"Angnadi,\" \"Entrance,\" etc.]\nThe spaces between the lines \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) represent an outlet for drainage purposes, which is made either on the eastern or northern face. The main entrance at \\(c\\) is always constructed on the southern half of the face \\(E\\), so as to afford a screen to the inner doorway, which is in the centre of the line \\(e\\). The other principal doorways are built in the centre of the walls, north, west, south. The doorways are merely vacant spaces which, when required, are closed with a rough brushwood or grass screen called a \"tatti.\" In the Patti and Partabgarh tahsils one sees more thatch-pent roofs than any other; but in the Bih\u00e1r tahsil the flat mud roof is principally adopted. The walls are covered with a rough frame-work of leaves and r\u00fa\u0161 brushwood, and clay is then plastered over it for a thickness of about two feet. These roofs, used also as dormitories in the hot weather, are preferred to the pent roof, as they do not leak and last for many years; whereas the latter require renewal every year or two, according to the extent of the ravages made by the white-ants. Sometimes one sees a habitation combining both styles of roof. Then again, there is the single slope thatch roof, constructed by building up the inner wall to a considerable height above the outer one, and then applying the hypotheneuse in the shape of a cumbrous thatch frame-work. Those who can afford the luxury use tiles. This is of course exceptional, and the fashion dates from annexation only. Within the space shown in the above figure, the cultivator manages to house his family, to shelter his bullock (and, if a Cham\u00e1r or P\u00e1s\u00ed, to keep his pigs like the Irishman in his cabin),* to store his grain, and in fact to keep all his worldly possessions. The zamindars and more opulent classes enclose their dwellings again by another outer wall, within which cattle sheds are erected and fuel and grain stored without encroaching on the inner space reserved for the privacy of the family.\n\nReceptacles for storing grain.\u2014Of grain storing receptacles the following deserve mention:\u2014The \"garh\" or \"khaun,\" a deep circular hole generally constructed within the \u00e1ngan, capable of holding from 100 to 300 standard maunds of grain. The mouth of the hole is narrow, seldom exceeding two feet in diameter, and retains this width until it reaches some three feet below the surface of the ground when it rapidly widens into the required dimensions. In this the different grains to be stored are deposited in layers, with a stratum of chopped straw between each sort. The mouth is then closed up in the following manner:\u2014At the bottom of the shaft or entrance hole sticks are secured cross-wise, and over these straw is placed, mud is then applied, and lastly dry earth is filled in up to the level of the ground. This style of storehouse is more common to the premises of the zamindar and village banker than to the dwelling of the ordinary cultivator. When closed up in Jeth (May and June) the garh is not opened until the season arrives for making advances and for sowing.\n\nThe koth is the common granary of the cultivator, and is a curious contrivance. It consists of a solid mass of clay mixed with chopped straw, of circular shape, about three feet in diameter, and from about\n\n---\n\n* Cham\u00e1rs and P\u00e1s\u00eds are, as a rule, only allowed to keep pigs within their dwellings when their houses are situated on the outskirts of the village, as indeed is generally the case.\ntwelve to sixteen inches in thickness. This is deposited in one of the kothris or chambers of the habitation, and upon it are piled up some five or six more circles of the same dimensions, but hollowed out in the centre so as to leave a lateral thickness of about four inches. The interstices are then carefully plastered over, and when the whole is quite dry, the grain is poured in at the top and a cover applied. Lastly, a hole is made below on a level with the upper surface of the first or solid circle, whence the grain is taken out as required. A wisp of straw or a wooden bung serves as a stopper. A koth is capable of containing up to thirty-five maunds. More than one sort of grain is not kept in the koth at the same time. Rice is frequently stored in a primitive fashion called \"bakh\u00e1r.\" A clear space outside the dwelling is selected, so situated as to be within sight of the inmates by day, one of the male members of the family sleeping close to the spot at night. The rice is then collected here and covered completely with straw, over which mud is plastered to a thickness of some four or five inches. When the value of rice has risen, the bakh\u00e1r is opened and the grain sold to the highest bidder.\n\nThere is lastly the interior bakh\u00e1r for the rabi grains. This is merely a cross-wall run up at one end of a kothri or chamber to a height of about five feet, in the space enclosed by which the different grains are kept, separated by layers of bh\u00fasa or chopped straw. The arrangement is made with due regard to the immediate and ulterior requirements of the family. Access to this store room is by means of a short ladder. In all receptacles of grain dried mahua leaves are placed, in order to keep off the white-ant.\n\nFurniture.\u2014Of other common articles of house furniture may be mentioned the \"chond\" or cylindrical earthen vessel for holding flour, salt, &c., and with a varying capacity of from two to five maunds; the \"chirwi\" or earthen cooking pot with a wide mouth, of which there are at least three or four in every house; the \"galwa,\" a large coarsely made circular basket in which the bullocks receive their feed of chopped straw or stalks; the \"jhawwa,\" a similar basket but smaller, in which is carried to the field the seed for sowing; the \"tokri\" or \"palri\" and the \"sikhaula,\" still smaller baskets, with very little apparent difference between them, which are used as refuse baskets and for a variety of common purposes, which it is hardly necessary to detail; the \"dauri,\" a bamboo-made basket for holding flour in, and which is also used as a grain measure; the \"mauni,\" a small hand basket made of \"k\u00e1sa\" grass, bound with \"m\u00fanj\" (sheath of the \"sarpat\" grass), and used in sowing. The \"mauni\" is filled from the \"jhawwa\" and is held in one hand, while the seed is taken out and scattered with the other; the \"s\u00fap\" or winnowing fan, made of \"sirk\u00ed;\" the \"chalni,\" \"bikna,\" and \"\u00e1kha,\" different kinds of grain and flour sieves; the \"m\u00fasal,\" a wooden instrument, with a iron ring at one end, used for threshing purposes; the \"p\u00edrha\" and \"bilna,\" board and rolling pin for kneading, (the p\u00edrha is sometimes also a flat stone); the \"sil\" and \"lorha,\" a flat stone and round stone used for pounding spices and condiments, in fact a rude pestle and mortar. The \"charkha,\" or cotton spinning-wheel, used by women only; the \"charp\u00e1i\" or common bedstead, and the \"machia,\" a low four-cornered stool, complete the list of articles.\nof primitive furniture to be commonly seen in the interior of a Partabgarh peasant's hut. As a rule the owner is careful in observing the old maxim\u2014a place for everything and everything in its place; for one seldom sees confusion and untidiness in his internal arrangements. Filth and rubbish may reign rampant outside and around the dwelling, but, generally speaking, the inside will be found to be neat and clean.\n\nFood.\u2014As might be expected from the foregoing details, the food of the masses is exceedingly simple, and varies with each harvest. After the rabi harvest cakes made of wheaten flour, ground barley, peas, grain, &c., are chiefly eaten. Rice and other kharif grains succeed to these in their season, and are varied with lentils (dal). As a savoury adjunct ghi is mixed with their food by those who can afford it. \"Gur\" (molasses) is also a luxury which but few comparatively can afford daily. It is chiefly eaten with the noon-tide \"chabena\" or parched grain. Vegetables and fruit are, in their seasons, largely consumed. The first meal is generally taken between 9 A.M. and noon, and the second after sunset. Seldom is food taken before 9 o'clock in the morning. For those engaged in agricultural pursuits, the women of the house always cook and prepare their food. In fact, the hard work and general drudgery of the household here, as elsewhere in India, falls to the lot of the weaker vessel.\n\nDress and ornaments.\u2014Excluding the wealthier classes, who can afford fine muslins, silks, &c., the mass of the population may be separated into two divisions with regard to the nature of the material with which they usually clothe themselves. The least poor of these two divisions wear, as a rule, the English fabrics here known as \"m\u00e1rk\u00edn\" and \"nainsukh,\" while the dress of the poorest class is almost entirely composed of the coarse country materials called \"g\u00e1ra,\" \"dhotar,\" and \"gazi.\" The ordinary dress of the Hindu is the \"mirz\u00e1\u00ed,\" or short jacket with sleeves, below which is worn the \"dhoti.\" Round the head is twisted the \"dupatta,\" which is a long narrow strip of any common material. The Muhammadan usually wears tight \"p\u00e1ej\u00e1mas,\" fastened round the waist and reaching about six inches below the knee, over which he throws the \"kurta,\" or long loose garment with sleeves, which falls down as far as the knees. The mirz\u00e1\u00ed of the Hindu is fastened in front on the right, while the similar fastening of the Muhammadan garment is on the left. The Hindu female peasant attire is ordinarily the dhoti and the \"lahnga pharia.\" The former is, as a rule, the dress of the older women, and the latter that of the younger. The dhoti is simply a large sheet, two-thirds of which are rolled round the body, and the remainder thrown over the head and shoulders. The \"lahnga pharia,\" consists of two garments;\u2014viz., the lahnga, a kind of petticoat, commonly made of some stripped or coloured material, fastened at the waist, and the pharia, a simple piece of some coarse material like g\u00e1ra, &c., and not unlike the dhoti. It is thrown over the head and upper portion of the body, and the ends in front are tucked in beneath the lahnga. A \"kurti\" or short jacket, without sleeves, or with very small sleeves, is often worn with either style of dress. The dress of the Muhammadan women does not much differ from the above, except that the Qureshi women often wear loose p\u00e1ej\u00e1mas and a sheet (or as it is in\nthis instance called dupatta) thrown over the head and shoulders, thence falling down to about the knees; under this again the kurti above described is usually worn.\n\nMode of collection and of payment of the Government demand, &c.\u2014The mode of collecting rents and of meeting the Government demand differs according to the tenure of the village. In the case of zamindari and imperfect pattidari villages, the whole proprietary body are responsible for the failure of one sharer; in pattidari estates again where the partition is perfect and complete, and extends to the waste and uncultivable lands, the defaulting pattidar is alone liable for his sins of omission. The arrangements for the cultivation are, as a rule, made by the lambadar or lambardars, or by these in conjunction with the other shareholders.\n\nSuccession and transfer.\u2014With regard to succession to landed property amongst the Hindus, on the death of a sharer, without male issue, his widow is allowed to succeed. She cannot, however, alienate the property without the consent of the community. In the case of inability to meet the Government demand, arising from bad seasons or other causes over which she has had, and could have had no control, mortgage or sale is permissible. On her death, the property goes to the nearest of kin in the male line according to the Shastras. Amongst the Muhammadans, on the death of a proprietor, the widow succeeds as in the above case. If there be more than one wife, each shares equally, and under the same restriction with regard to transfer as among the Hindus. Landed property is usually distributed among Hindus according to the principle of Jethansi, which secures to the eldest son or heir a larger share than goes to the others. The measure of the Jethansi varies very much according to the locality. For instance, in the taluqas of Patti Saifabad and Raipur Bichhaur, in the Patti tahsil, the share of the eldest son is 11-20th and that of the younger 9-20th, the calculation being based on the bigha which consists of 20 biswas. Again, in taluqa Dariapur in the same tahsil, the share of the eldest is twice that of each of the younger sons. In taluqa Dhingarh, in tahsil Bih\u00e1r, the shares are 9-16th and 7-16th, based on the rupee. In smaller estates the division on these principles is very tedious.\n\nGroves: Custom as regards owners of estates.\u2014I propose first to notice the custom prevailing in this district with regard to the planting of groves, and to the liability of the owner or occupier to the payment of rent in the event of the trees being felled and the land cleared. The first class consists of those who have a full proprietary or under-proprietary right in the lands of the entire estate, and whose responsibilities have been once for all fixed in a lump sum, either with reference to the imperial demand, or to the due of the superior holder in the case of sub-settlements. The superior holder is bound by the tentative rules in force, which, with the object of encouraging the growth of plantations, exempt from assessment a wooded area not exceeding 10 per cent. of the whole. Failing in this object, grove lands, if found to be wantonly cleared of trees, will be liable to future assessment. Similarly, and by implication, is the discre-\ntion of the under-proprietor in sub-settled estates restricted by the same rules.\n\nCustom as regards ex-proprietors and tenants with a right of occupancy.\u2014The next class is composed of those persons who are ex-proprietors, but who are possessed of an under-proprietary right in their sir and s\u00e1yar lands; (the latter including grove lands); of tenants with a right of occupancy, and those who have purchased or have otherwise acquired proprietary or under-proprietary rights in any portion of the village lands. These persons pay the rent which has been assessed upon their holdings through the superior holder or m\u00e1lguz\u00e1r. Now, it is obvious that they can plant to any extent they please, so long as they continue to discharge their liabilities. But what is the effect of cutting down their groves, and so increasing the cultivated area of their holdings? The custom, as ascertained in this district, authorizes the superior holder in such cases to demand rent so soon as the land thus cleared is brought under the plough, no matter whether, as grove land, it had been held rent-free for generations. Occasionally, in the case of an ex-proprietor, the taluqdar will refrain from exercising this power; but, as a rule, it is freely exercised, and in the case of purchasers and other outsiders without mercy or compunction. It is a custom which, supplementing as it does the local rules regarding the larger wooded areas, has a direct tendency to preserve intact the smaller plantations.\n\nCustom as regards tenants-at-will.\u2014The third and last class consists of tenants-at-will, and as the groves occupied by these form a very considerable proportion of the entire timber lands of the district, it is of the utmost importance to carefully record in the \"W\u00e1jib-ul-arz\" (administration paper) the customs and usages which prevail with regard to their tenure of such lands, as well as the relations which in this respect, subsist between them and the landlord. First of all, it by no means follows that because a cultivator has been forced through enhancement of rent, or by other circumstances, to relinquish his holding, he is therefore obliged to abandon his grove also. My experience in this and the adjoining district of Sultanpur, has convinced me that so long as the cultivator remains in the village, he retains a lien on his grove, even though dispossessed of his cultivated holding. There is one general exception to this rule, however, and this I can better describe with the aid of an illustration than in abstract terms. For instance A, a cultivator, has a holding of 10 bighas for which he pays a rent of Rs. 40. He asks B, his landlord, for two bighas more, for the purpose of planting a grove. B, consents and gives A. two bighas of waste or cultivated land for the purpose required. No rent is charged for this two bighas, but the rent on the holding is raised from Rs. 40 to 50. A. sets to work and plants the two bighas with trees. In the event of ouster, A. loses trees and all. If, on the other hand, A, content with his original 10 bighas, plants a grove in one bigha, and continues to pay Rs. 40 rent for the remaining 9 bighas, he still retains possession of his trees if ousted from his cultivated holding.\n\nUsufruct and timber.\u2014As regards the usufruct, with the exception of the mahua tree, the right of the planter of the grove is complete. I shall\nrefer separately to mahua plantations. The custom as regards the felling of the trees permits the cultivator to sell, or otherwise dispose of the timber without reference to the landlord, it being however at the same time generally understood that no fresh trees can take the place of those cut down without the sanction of the latter. Here again the mahua tree is an exception. No such tree on which is levied a \"k\u00fat\"* or \"per\u00ed\"\u2020 tax can be felled without the consent of the lord of the manor. In the case of an under-proprietor who pays in a lump sum, including the per\u00ed, he can of course fell his mahua trees, provided he continues to pay the entire rent assessed upon his holding; but if he pays a cash rent for the land, and a k\u00fat or fruit tax on his mahua trees, he cannot do so; the latter being in a manner hypothecated for the tax assessed upon them. Untaxed mahua is quite the exception. The k\u00fat or share of the fruit preponderates over the per\u00ed or money value. The proportion given to the over-proprietor in the former case varies from one-half share to three-fourths of the produce: as a rule, the latter is the prevailing rate as regards tenants-at-will.\n\nMahua groves.\u2014Mr. C. W. McMinn, C.S., who was formerly Assistant Settlement Officer of this district, has left on record some very valuable remarks regarding the mahua of these parts. His enquiries extended over some weeks, and were chiefly conducted among the extensive mahua groves of the Kunda tahsil. Mr. McMinn writes:\u2014\"The 'broadest distinction is generally found between mahua groves and all others; mahua, as a rule, seems just as much a village asset for revenue purposes as wheat, and to have been so regarded in the Nawabi. Whether zamindar, or Brahman, or as\u00e1mi planted mahua, whenever the tree ceased to be a 'pora,' viz., in from ten to twenty years, according to soil, the right to its produce accrued to the m\u00e1lguz\u00e1r. There are of course innumerable exceptions among the lacs of mahua trees in this district, but I have made hundreds of enquiries beneath the trees while the fruit was dropping and gatherers collecting, and I am pretty certain that this was not only the general practice, but that it had quite reached the dimensions of an unquestioned right. For one man who disputes it in our courts twenty have quietly acquiesced. Either the m\u00e1lguz\u00e1r took per\u00ed, or he included the rent of the trees in the jam\u00e1f land,\u2021 or he took k\u00fat. This last was as follows:\u2014Three-fourths of the estimated produce to the m\u00e1lguz\u00e1r, one-fourth to the grove owner, who had also to defray the expenses of gathering the mahua (one-twelfth of the gross produce), storing and drying. The above being the case, the question arises,\u2014have either old proprietors or others any valuable interest to claim in mahua groves? Undoubtedly they have. This fourth, which is occasionally raised to a third, and even a half, is valued and fought for, while the per\u00ed is generally very moderate, and the jam\u00e1f system facilitates embezzlement.\n\n\"I do not believe there is a single village in which the taluqdar did not generally or at times, under a well recognized custom, take the\n\n* \"K\u00fat\" is a tax paid in kind, being a certain fixed share of the fruit.\n\u2020 \"Per\u00ed\" is a cash payment, and varies from 4 to 12 annas per tree.\n\u2021 Cash rent paying land.\u2014W. E. F.\nmass of the mahua produce, leaving one-fourth to the collector as payment for his labour. Many things complicated this enquiry, and made the clearing up of the parties' rights difficult. Unlike cereals mahua is an irregular crop; every fourth year there is none, or so little that the taluqdar will not take the trouble of asserting his rights. For all those years the zamindar can truly say that he held his trees free. Again, by acknowledged custom, whoever plants a grove holds it free, keeping all the produce as long as it is a pora. I have been unable to determine even approximately the recognized age when a tree ceases to be a pora; at first I used to hear that it was about twelve years, but the moment the zamindars found that the point might become of use to an officer who was seeking out facts, then the limit of the age of a pora rose to 20, 30, 40 years; nor were the taluqdar's witnesses a whit behind. Still every zamindar can point to real pora trees, or to those which he has as yet managed to keep out of the paying register, and say with truth 'look at my muafi trees!'\n\n\"I have no doubt that the zamindars had many trees muafi, (rent free); many more included in their jama\u00ed land, according to the peculiar custom of the taluqas, but the rest are the right of the taluqdar, and his rights are too large to be lost through any ignorance of the pargana custom, or ill-grounded trust in oral evidence, without doing him serious damage, and leading to a general distrust of our courts.\"\n\nMahua in Patti.\u2014In the Patti pargana the mahua tree is untaxed. In one village only, viz., mauza Pipri, in the Adh\u00e1rganj estate, in which there are about 50 trees, is peri paid by a family of Brahman ex-proprietors at the extraordinarily high rate of Rs. 2 per large tree, and Re. 1 for the smaller ones, not poras. In all other parts of the pargana, the planter of the grove enjoys the entire produce without let or hindrance; and yet Patti is composed almost exclusively of taluqdari estates.\n\nCultivator's right over his grove.\u2014Whilst in some portions of the district the cultivator or tenant-at-will possesses an absolute power over the trees of his grove, so that he can mortgage and even sell without the previously obtained sanction of the landlord, there are many places where his rights are so restricted that he can only enjoy the usufruct, but cannot pick up the smallest twig in the shape of dried or fallen wood, much less fell, mortgage, or otherwise alienate the trees.\n\nBeruni and l\u00fawarsi trees.\u2014It is usual in some estates to set apart one or two mango groves in a village, according to its size, for the sole benefit of the cultivators on the rent-roll. \"Beruni\" or \"l\u00fawarsi\" trees (that is, trees which have sprung up of themselves, or the former owners of which have died without heirs, or have left the village) belong exclusively to the lord of the manor. He either consumes or sells the produce himself, or else he adds a patch of land, on which are growing some of these trees, to a tenant's holding, and turns the deed to account by raising the rent on the latter. This is what is sometimes called jama\u00ed holding, but the term in this sense is restricted.\n\nRights of irrigation.\u2014Rights of irrigation may be broadly classified as natural and artificial. Under the former come rights of irrigation from\nrivers, n\u00e1las, jhils, and swamps; while under the latter are comprised all rights in wells, excavated tanks and ponds, and embankments. With reference to irrigation from natural sources, the custom is that should the landholder require water he is first to be served, then the cultivators, according to priority of sowing, on the principle that the earliest sown crop soonest requires water. The second class ordinarily gives rise to disputes and litigation, but in this district irrigation suits have been remarkably few.\n\nArtificial reservoirs.\u2014Rights in wells are clear, and are seldom, if ever, called in question. With regard to artificial reservoirs two classes may be said to exist, viz., (1) those in the case of which the excavator or his heir is living and in possession, and (2) those in which all rights have lapsed. In the former case, after taking as much water as his purpose requires, the owner usually allows the privilege of irrigation to such cultivators of the village or neighbouring village as he pleases. In the latter case, however, it is usual for the lord of the manor to first irrigate his sir lands; afterwards those cultivators, whose lands are situated within reach of the water, appoint a committee to estimate the contents of the reservoir and the amount of land which it is proposed to irrigate. The amount of water to which each man is entitled is then apportioned in dauris. The dauri contains about five gallons, and the dogla rather more than twice as much. This distribution of water by the \"b\u00e1ch\" system extensively prevails in this district, and, being regulated by a sort of standing panch\u00e1yat (court of arbitration), tends to reconcile mal-contents who would otherwise come into court. The patw\u00e1ri is ordinarily ex-officio member of the \"panch\u00e1yat,\" the remaining three or four members being either landholders, muqaddams, or other respectable residents. It has come to my knowledge that a practice has begun to prevail in some parts of levying irrigation dues, or in other words of selling water. P\u00e1hik\u00e1sht cultivators requiring the commodity are made to pay 8 annas per diem for each \"rlk\" or raising station which they work. This is another innovation which characterises the age we live in, in connection with the gradual decay of caste prejudice.\n\nGrazing rights.\u2014The subject of grazing rights may be dismissed in a few words. Unfortunately for the cultivator and his live stock, the grazing area is yearly becoming more restricted. The uncultivated land of a village is, as a rule, free for grazing purposes, not only to its own cattle, but to the cattle of the neighbourhood. In other words, clusters of villages possess pasture lands common to all. This simple arrangement, based on ancient custom, does away with all ground of contention. Disputes when they do arise are nearly always connected with the trespass of cattle in the cultivation, and the consequent damage to the crops. They are not occasioned by any abstract ideas of right in this or that patch of waste. Grazing dues are at present unknown amongst the agricultural population, but how long they will remain so it would be hazardous to conjecture. A system of irrigation dues may be soon followed up by the levy of a tax on grazing.\n\nManure stacks.\u2014Manure heaps are in some districts frequent cause of contention. In this district however disputes have been rare. Since the\nissue of the prohibition against stacking manure within the inhabited inclosures, it is usual to collect it in a grove, or other convenient waste spot. Not unfrequently cultivators dig a large hole in a corner of a field, and throw into it all the manure and refuse matter they can get hold of. There are no common manure heaps. Each zamindar and each cultivator possesses his own, quite apart from the others.\n\nShankalp.\u2014The religious tenure known as \"shankalp\" largely prevails in this district. Grants of shankalp vary in extent from one or two bighas to entire estates of several villages, and are confined to Brahmins. As a rule some consideration was always given. The grantee either gave a large entertainment, or an elephant, camel, horse, or other valuable article such as a shawl; less frequently a present of money or jewels. In very rare instances was the value given a purely nominal one.\n\nBirt, which is a tenure in some respects analogous to shankalp, finds no existence in this district. Not a single suit founded on a birt holding has come before the courts.\n\nD\u00e1r.\u2014There is however a tenure in Patti, and strictly confined to that pargana which goes by the name of \"d\u00e1r.\" It is similar to the kind of birt known as \"bai birt,\" or purchased birt; d\u00e1r, as existing in this district, represents a purchased interest in a patch of land or chak, and is obtainable by all classes. It is never found to extend to entire villages. The real and primary meaning of the word d\u00e1r is obscure. It is said to be a corruption of zamindari. There are 403 acres at present held under this tenure.\n\nThe following table of the tenures in the Partabgarh district is roughly correct, assuming that column 15 does not include the owners of sir:\u2014\n## Statement of Tenures, &c.\n\n| Name of pargana | No. of villages and hamlets | Total area |\n|-----------------|----------------------------|-----------|\n|                  |                            |           |\n|                  |                            |           |\n\n### Settlement\n\n- Khore niwazas:\n  - Dhaki villagee and iractionals parts:\n\n### Village Lands not sub-settled:\n\n- Total: [value]\n\n### Uninhabited:\n\n- Total: [value]\n\n### Independent:\n\n#### Proprietors\n\n- Number of sub-proprietors:\n\n#### Resident cultivators:\n\n- Number of landholders:\n\n#### Non-resident cultivators:\n\n- Number of sub-proprietors:\n\n#### Protector:\n\n- Sub-protection or under-protector:\n\n#### Remarks:\n\n|          | Of land per acre | Remarks |\n|----------|------------------|---------|\n|          |                  |         |\n## List of proprietors paying more than Rs. 5,000.\n\n| Number | Name of owner | Name of estate | Number of villages | Area | Government jama. | Remarks |\n|--------|---------------|----------------|--------------------|------|-----------------|---------|\n| 1      | R\u00e1mp\u00e1l Singh and R\u00e1ja Hauwant Singh | Dh\u00e1rupur K\u00e1lala Kankar, Bhadri | 196 | 101,264 | Rs. a. p. 86,088 | Bisen. |\n| 2      | B\u00e1e Jagat Bah\u00e1dur Singh | Patti Safabad, 11th share. | 98 | 68,611 | 78,406 | Do. |\n| 3      | D\u00edw\u00e1n Ran Bijai Bah\u00e1dur Singh. | | 170 | 61,563 | 59,352 | Bachgoti. |\n| 4      | Ajit Kunwar ... | Do. 9th do., Bahloipur ... | 116 | 47,810 | 61,768 | Do. |\n| 5      | R\u00e1ja Bijai Bah\u00e1dur Singh. | | 60 | 227,000 | 29,245 | Sombansi. |\n| 6      | Thakur\u00e1in J\u00e1nki Kunwar | Puw\u00e1nsi ... | 94 | 43,495 | 43,495 | Do. |\n| 7      | B\u00e1e M\u00e1dho Parsh\u00e1d Singh. | Adh\u00e1rganj ... | 99 | 42,575 | 44,765 | Bachgoti. |\n| 8      | Thakur\u00e1in Raijnat\u00e1h Kunwar, Chhatarp\u00e1l Singh, S\u00e1raj P\u00e1l Singh, Chandarp\u00e1l Singh. | Kundraj\u00edt, | 68 | 43,938 | 43,574 | Bisen. |\n| 9      | R\u00e1ja Surp\u00e1l Singh ... | Mustafabad, Madhopur ... | 27 | 22,646 | 25,597 | Kanhpuria. |\n| 10     | L\u00e1l Bah\u00e1dur Singh, Nagashar Bakhsh, Hanom\u00e1n Singh, Chanharja Singh, Saltanat Singh, Sit\u00eda Bakhsh Singh. | | 83 | 28,836 | 25,204 | Bachgoti. |\n| 11     | R\u00e1ja Ajit Singh ... | Tarwal ... | 59 | 19,977 | 67,235 | Sombansi. |\n| 12     | Thakur\u00e1in Sult\u00e1n Kunwar, R\u00e1e Biheshwar Bakhsh Singh. | R\u00e9epur Bichaur. | 83 | 47,240 | 39,164 | Bachgoti. |\n| 13     | B\u00e1bu D\u00e1n Bah\u00e1dur P\u00e1l Singh. | D\u00e1ndi Kaohh, | 31 | 18,063 | 14,849 | Kalhans. |\n| 14     | B\u00e1bu Hanom\u00e1n Bakhsh Singh. | Dom\u00edpur ... | 47 | 16,825 | 17,313 | Sombansi. |\n| 15     | D\u00edw\u00e1n Harmangal Singh | Urayya Dih Jamt\u00e1l\u00ed. | 53 | 15,497 | 16,585 | Bachgoti. |\n| 16     | R\u00e1ja Mahesh Bakhsh Singh. | Kaithaula ... | 30 | 13,998 | 16,099 | Kanhpuria. |\n| 17     | L\u00e1l Sit\u00eda Bakhsh and L\u00e1l Shankar Singh. | Dh\u00e1ngarh ... | 45 | 18,829 | 15,549 | Bisen. |\n| 18     | B\u00e1bu Bajrang Bah\u00e1dur Singh. | Baispur ... | 29 | 11,655 | 14,915 | Sombansi. |\n| 19     | B\u00e1bu Balbhaddar Singh, B\u00e1bu Hardatt Singh ... | Suj\u00e1kh\u00e1r ... | 52 | 13,630 | 14,465 | Do. |\n| 20     | Sagan\u00e1th Kunwar and Kharag Kunwar. | Pitthiganj ... | 84 | 10,570 | 12,660 | Do. |\n| 21     | L\u00e1l Mahesh Bakhsh Singh. | Dasr\u00e1thpur, | 19 | 7,686 | 8,285 | Bachgoti. |\n| 22     | L\u00e1l Sarabj\u00edt Singh ... | Dah\u00edaw\u00e1n ... | 10 | 6,356 | 7,845 | Bisen. |\n| 23     | Shekhpur Char\u00e1s. | | 12 | 4,647 | 5,754 | Do. |\n| 24     | L\u00e1l Sh\u00ed\u00e1ambar Singh ... | R\u00e9japur ... | 9 | 4,865 | 6,199 | Kanhpuria. |\n| 25     | B\u00e1bu Mahip\u00e1l Singh ... | Umr\u00e1n ... | 6 | 5,008 | 6,065 | Do. |\n| 26     | R\u00e1ja Chitp\u00e1l Singh ... | Chitp\u00e1lgarh, | 15 | 4,575 | 5,980 | Sombansi. |\n| 27     | R\u00e1ja Mahesh Nar\u00edn Singh. | Parh\u00e1s ... | 15 | 4,729 | 5,800 | Drigban\u00e9. |\n| 28     | R\u00e1e Bh\u00e1gwant Singh, Jagmohan Singh, Arat Singh, Bisheshwar Bakhsh Singh. | Dari\u00e9pur ... | 37 | 13,985 | 19,985 | Bachgoti. |\n\n*Cannot be correctly given as he has sold some villages.*\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nADMINISTRATIVE FEATURES.\n\nAdministration\u2014Police\u2014Crimes\u2014Accidental deaths\u2014Population of thanas\u2014Revenue and Expenditure\u2014Education\u2014Postal statistics.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The administration is carried on by a deputy commissioner with five or six assistants and extra assistants, European and native, and four tahsildars.\n\nAll these courts have civil, criminal, and revenue powers;

The high school, in addition to preparing pupils for the Canning College at Lucknow, and for the University classes, \"must also,\" it has been distinctly laid down, \"play the part of an ordinary village school,\" and again, that the elementary education of the agricultural masses, is \"one of the special though incidental duties of the high school.\" The average attendance during the year 1869-70 was 129, which was 78 per cent. of the number registered. Two of the taluqdars of the district, Raja Chitpal Singh of Nurpur\u2020 and Babu Mahesh Bakhsh of Dahiawan, have been educated at this school, which they attended for some seven years. The senior inspector has reported that \"both have received a very fair education, and take much interest in the village schools on their estates, as well as in the school where they were educated.\" They are still anxious to improve themselves, and devote much of their leisure time to reading English standard works. They are good landlords, and have the respect of their tenantry.\n\nVernacular town schools.\u2014With regard to the vernacular town schools, Mr. Harington has recorded that they \"are of peculiar interest and deserve special encouragement. Their high aim is ultimately to convey in Eastern tongues to Eastern minds the advance which has been made in Western civilization and thought.\" The Patti school registers 90 students, of which number 80, or 88.8 per cent., constitute the average attendance; while 52 is the number borne on the rolls of the Bihar school, of which the average attendance is 45, or 86.5 per cent. Urdu, Nagri, and Persian are the languages in which instruction is conveyed. Of the total number of students 116 are Hindus, principally Chhattris, Brahmans, and Kayaths, and 26 are Muhammadans. There are five teachers on monthly salaries of from Rs. 30 to Rs. 7.\n\nGrant-in-aid school.\u2014The grant-in-aid school at Nawabganj on the estate of Shekh Dost Muhammad, Taluqdar of Pariawan, is supported by subscriptions and by the Government grant-in-aid. It is attended by 54 pupils, of whom 20 are Muhammadans and the remainder Hindus. Two teachers are employed\u2014one on Rs. 20 per mensem and the other on Rs 6. The course is much the same as in the vernacular town school. Shekh Dost Muhammad takes a deep interest in the welfare of this school, and though far from well off, has contributed handsomely towards the neat and substantial building, which is now the alma mater of Nawabganj.\n\n* These remarks on schools, which are taken from the Partabgarh settlement report, were written some years ago. There are at present in Partabgarh 90 schools of all classes, and the number of scholars on the rolls, on the 31st March, 1875, was 3,194.\n\n\u2020 The head and representative of the old family of Partabgarh.\nVillage schools.\u2014With regard to village schools the district may be said to be studded with them:\n\nIn Tahsil Pattl are 17 schools.\n\" \" Partabgarh 19 \"\n\" \" Kunda 14 \"\n\nThe attendance has been falling off of late, owing chiefly to high prices and to the impoverished circumstances of the agricultural classes, which furnish the largest proportion of pupils. The pressure has the effect of causing the parents to withdraw their sons from the school, and transfer them to the field, where their labours prove more directly remunerative. A succession of good harvests will, I have no doubt, by and bye, put money in the pockets of the husbandman, and restore a good attendance in the schools. The curriculum is reading and writing, elementary arithmetic, dictation, grammar, and composition, geography, the history of India, mensuration of surfaces and land surveying. There are 66 boys in this district, who, as members of the senior class, are learning these latter subjects. Of the sons of zamindars, actual proprietors or under-proprietors in the soil, 316 are students in the village schools, while of others the numbers are:\n\n| Category                        | Number |\n|---------------------------------|--------|\n| Sons of patw\u0101ris and q\u0101n\u0101ngos   | 162    |\n| cultivators                     | 495    |\n| artizans                        | 129    |\n| traders and bankers              | 75     |\n| professional men such as pandits, hakims, &c. | 92     |\n| Government servants             | 88     |\n| private servants                | 45     |\n| **Total**                       | **1,080** |\n\nOf Hindus, the Chhattri caste as usual preponderates, next comes the Brahman, then the K\u0101yath, the remainder being contributed by the Sudra classes. The proportion of Muhammadan to Hindu students is 36\u00b79 per cent., which, having regard to the relative numbers of the whole population, would seem to indicate a greater desire to avail themselves of the educational opportunities offered them, on the part of the former than of the latter. Sixty-three teachers find employment in the village schools of this district, and are in receipt of salaries ranging from Rs. 10 to 5. The majority receive Rs. 6 to 7. It will be a good thing for the department when circumstances will admit of the salaries of teachers being raised. The qualifications of several entitle them to higher emoluments.\n\nGirls\u2019 school.\u2014Female education may be said to have made a beginning, though a modest one in this district. A girls\u2019 school has been opened at Nawabganj under the superintendence of the active and intelligent deputy inspector, Munshi Muhammad Husen. The pupils at present only number thirteen, but small beginning in a work of such vital importance, viewed in reference to the enlightenment of the masses, are not to be despised.\n\nDistrict postal arrangement.\u2014The d\u0101k cess in this district amounts to Rs. 2,981 and the Government grant-in-aid to Rs. 576, making a grand\ntotal of Rs. 3,557. This sum provides for thirteen postmasters, thirty-one runners, and twenty-six delivery peons, leaving a small margin for contingencies. The following tables are from the Chief Inspector's office:\n\n**Statement showing the working of the district dak during 1876-77.**\n\n| No. of miles of dak line | ... | ... | ... | 78 |\n|--------------------------|-----|-----|-----|----|\n| No. of runners           | ... | ... | ... | 31*|\n| Cost for the year        | ... | ... | Rs. | 2,565-9-10 |\n| No. of covers delivered  | ... | ... |     | 30,087 |\n| No. of covers returned undelivered | ... | ... |     | 2,591 |\n| Total No. of letters sent to district post-office | ... | ... |     | 32,600 |\n\n* Ten runners have worked for a part of the year.\nCHAPTER V.\n\nHISTORY.\n\nHistory\u2014Antiquities.\n\nHistory.\u2014It has not been thought necessary to give any account of Partabgarh in the past under the district heading. There are three great clans in the district\u2014the Sombansi of pargana Partabgarh, the Bachgoti of Patti Dalippur, and the Bisen of Bihar, Manikpur. The annals of each clan are identical with those of its own peculiar parganas; they did not interfere with each other; their interests did not clash, nor did they conquer or expel each other. The history of each can be given consecutively without diverging into the annals of others, and without digressions which weaken the narrative and weary the reader; it has not been thought desirable therefore to mix them up in a forced and unnatural connexion, and to give a retrospective unity to the district of Partabgarh, which in fact did not exist till after the reconquest of Oudh in 1858.\n\nThe history of the people of Partabgarh will be found under the pargana headings Patti, Partabgarh, and Manikpur. The more remarkable ancient sites and forts will be also there mentioned. As to antiquities there are none which can properly lay claim to the title \"Kukar Deora.\" Here and there in the Kunda tahsil are to be seen strange looking brick-built erections called Kukar Deora, resembling cupolas and pyramids. The former are nine feet in diameter at the base, and the latter seven and a half and eight feet; while the average height of both descriptions is about twelve feet. These curious buildings are by some ascribed to the Bhars, by others to the aboriginal Banjaras, others again affirm that they were built by bankers of old as treasure vaults. As a fact it is well known that from some of these treasure has been abstracted both before and since the rebellion. Whatever be their origin, their antiquity is undoubted. They go by the name of \"Kukar Deora,\" which means in Hindi \"dog's dwelling.\" This has reference to a curious superstition in connection with these buildings to the effect that a walk seven times round any one of them, and a peep in at the door, is a certain cure for the bite of a mad dog. I have been unable, in any tangible way to connect these quaint relics of the past with the Bhars. They are all situated at some distance from the existing and known sites of old Bhar towns and villages. Near Bilkhar there is a mound which is believed to be an ancient Buddhist tope.\n\nPARTABGARH Pargana\u2014Tahsil PARTABGARH\u2014District PARTABGARH.\n\nThis large pargana lies to the south-east of the district, extending for many miles on both sides of the river Sai. Its area is 355 square miles, of which 192 are cultivated. The population is 219,777 or 619 to the square mile: of this number 31,230 are Brahmans, 20,595 are Chhattis, 32,787, are Kurmis, 20,875 are Musalmans. Of the Chhattis above mentioned 13,000 are Sombansis, and the pargana presents an instance of a large area of country being owned by a numerous and powerful clan with its various chiefs, rajas, babus, and thakurs.\nThe following history of the Sombansis is taken from the Partabgarh settlement report:\n\nAs in the case of Patti Dalippur, the pargana of Partabgarh is co-extensive with the tahsil. It contains 634 villages, which are held as follows:\n\n| Taluqdari | Mufrad | Total |\n|-----------|--------|-------|\n| Sombansi  | 800    | 148   | 948  |\n| Bilkaria  | 4      | 13    | 17   |\n| Brahman   | *10    | 37    | 47   |\n| Bais      | *11    | 0     | 11   |\n| Kayath    | *2     | 12    | 14   |\n| Khattris  | *1     | 0     | 1    |\n| Bh\u00e1t      | 0      | 3     | 3    |\n| Raikw\u00e1r   | *2     | 0     | 2    |\n| Raghubansi| *1     | 0     | 1    |\n| Chandwaria| *1     | 0     | 1    |\n| Shekh     | 0      | 12    | 12   |\n| Path\u00e1n    | *9     | 2     | 11   |\n| Faqir (Muslim) | 0 | 1     | 1    |\n| Christians| 0      | 5     | 5    |\n\nTotal ... 401 233 634\n\nThe taluqas comprised under the 360 Sombansi villages are:\n\nBahloipur. Suj\u00e1khar.\nTirwal. Palaspur.\nD\u00e1nd\u00edkachh. P\u00edrth\u00edganj.\nDom\u00edpur. N\u00farpur.\n\nwhile the four Bilkaria villages constitute the miniature taluqa of Ant\u00fa, paying a revenue of Rs. 3,546-8.\n\nThe Sombansis.\u2014Partabgarh is the Sombansis\u2019 country. Beyond its limits they are rarely met with. Of course I except the other colony in the Hardoi district. Mr. Carnegy states that \u201cthe Sombans of these days give their daughters to the Gautam, Baghel, Gharw\u00e1r, and Mainpuri Chauh\u00e1n clans, and this indicates a higher status than is enjoyed by the local Bais, Bisen, and R\u00e1jkum\u00e1r tribes.\u201d Mr. W. C. Benett, C.S., in his report on the chief clans of the Rae Bareli district, has some interesting remarks about the Sombansi clans, more especially in connection with the Tiloi r\u00f3j of S\u00farat Singh (between 1670 and 1680 A.D.), and as they may serve to render more complete the history of the pargana as given by Mr. King, I shall offer no apology for transcribing them in this place.\n\nMr. W. C. Benett\u2019s account of the Sombansis of Partabgarh.\u2014\u201cThis tribe are found at the beginning of connected history at the fort of Jh\u00fasi, near Allahabad. They have no further traces of an immigration, and their tradition connects them for an indefinite period with their present dominions. The family worship is paid to five saints\u2014four of them princes of the Sombansi blood, and the fifth a Gharw\u00e1r R\u00e1ja of Benares, who\n\n* These are all loyal grantees, having been rewarded out of the portion of the Suj\u00e1khar estate, which was confiscated by the British Government owing to the discovery of a concealed gun in 1859. These grantees are entered in the lists appended to Act I, of 1868 and are therefore styled taluqdari in contradistinction to mufrad.\nsuccessfully abstracted themselves into nonentity during the Dvdparyug. The principal of these, Al\u00e1 Rikh, gave his name to the town and pargana Al\u00e1rikhpur, contracted into Aror and since named Partabgarh, and is perhaps identical with the \u00c1lap Rikh of Dalmau tradition, who resided in the Ganges forests, and whose teaching enabled D\u00e1l and B\u00e1l to attain their wide dominion. Two remarks may be made here,\u2014first, that the worship of the Manes of their ancestors is common to the Sombansis and several low castes in their neighbourhood. Bare Purukh is one of the favourite local penates, and shares with Si\u00e1d, the jackal, and K\u00fare Dec, the snake, the chief offerings of home devotion. Another is that the most ancient tradition discovers the Sombansis on the northern, and the dawn of history on the southern banks of the Ganges. An intermediate tradition, attested by the numerous remains of their peculiar forts, points to the existence of a Bhar r\u00e1j in the territory occupied before and after by the Chhattris. The commencement of the pedigree is, as usual, marked by some historical convulsion. Sakr\u00e1ma Singh had three sons,\u2014one of whom went to Naip\u00e1l, the second to Hardoi, while the third remained at Jh\u00fasi. The son of the latter was cursed by a Musalman faqir, Shekh Taqi, and lost his kingdom. The usual posthumous son was born in exile, and, with the name of Lakhan Sen, founded the kingdom of Aror. One of his sons was a convert to Isl\u00e1m, and in the eighth generation some subordinate centres of power began to branch off from the main r\u00e1j. No prince of this race attained any extraordinary distinction before Part\u00e1b Singh, who, in the last quarter of the seventeenth century, consolidated the power of his clan, built a huge new fort at Aror, which has since been known by his name, and assumed all the characteristics of independent sovereignty between the territories of the Bachgotis, the r\u00e1jas of M\u00e1nikpur and the Kanhpurias. He maintained an organized army composed chiefly of the militia levies of his clan, and furnished with a corps of sappers and miners enrolled from the Lunias of his pargana, and he provided for the population and tillage of his dominions by liberal grants of waste land to Brahmans and others.\"\n\n\"Conflict between the Sombansis and Kanhpurias.\u2014A prince of S\u00farat Singh's energy was not likely to remain long at peace with his neighbours, and a friendly interview afforded him the desired pretext for invading the contiguous domains of the Sombansis. Part\u00e1b Singh was lame, and on asking after S\u00farat Singh's health received the ordinary polite reply, 'ap ke gadam dekhne se,' to which he angrily retorted with reference to S\u00farat Singh's blindness, 'I too am well,' 'ap ke chashm dekhne se.' The personal insult was eagerly welcomed, and S\u00farat Singh marched at the head of his clansmen against Partabgarh. He was met at Hindsaur, and an obstinate battle resulted in the defeat of the Kanhpurias. As their chieftain was being carried from the field, he felt the\n\n*The present territories of the Kanhpurias and Sombansis are separated by the wide estates of the Bisens, but it does not appear that, at the time of S\u00farat Singh, the leaders of that tribe had attained the dignity of independent sovereigns. A very large part of their present property was under the rule of the Musalmans of M\u00e1nikpur, and of their three principal houses we find R\u00e1mpur ranged with the Kanhpurias and Dehra and Dhingwas with Sombansi. It is probable that they respectively owned the nominal supremacy of the chieftain in whose army they fought.\"\nwind strike on his sightless eyes, and asked from which quarter it came, and the answer, from the west, conveyed the first information of his defeat. His retreating forces were covered by a zamindar of Nain, who commanded the then unusual arm of a hundred matchlock men, and who for this received the grant of thirteen villages in the Salon pargana, which formed the root of the present large Nain taluqas.\"\n\nWe may now pass on to the more detailed history of the pargana as given by Mr. King.\u2014In this pargana the Bhars are said to have been the first inhabitants of whom there is no knowledge. The Raikwar Rajputs are said to have effected a footing in about one-third of the pargana as early as 554 fasli (A.D. 1147), and they were thus prior to the Sombansis, who hold now undisputed sway in the pargana. These are a very high caste of Chhattis, and give the following account of themselves. It may be known to the curious in such matters that Chhattis are said to have two primary classes, Bansik and Jaggik. The latter are those whose original stock can be traced to the creative power of some saint, as in the case of the Bachgotis of Patti. The Bansiks are those, whose origin defies research. They are in fact a kind of Melchisidees, without father without mother, &c., &c. To this highly ancient race the Sombansi clan belongs. In the eighth generation from Brahma was the Raja Jujiat who had one son called Pur and one called Jad, by different wives. Pur is the ancestor of the Sombansi and Jad of the Jadubansi. Ninety generations from Pur came Ramdeo, father of Bai Sen, and here we come to what may be history. Bai Sen had his castle at Jhusi near Allahabad on the north bank of the Ganges. This castle can be still pointed out I am told.\n\n\"Birth place of Lakhan Sen.\u2014To relapse into fable, Raja Bai Sen one day was visited by a Musalman saint, Sheikh Naqi, who very unreasonably requested him to clear out of the castle and leave it to the saint. The raja naturally refused, and was not prevailed on by the entreaties of his rani, who took part with the Sheikh. The saint of course killed the raja, and consoled the rani (who was pregnant), with the assurance that she should have a son of great renown. She went off north-ward as directed by the saint, and arriving at the ancient shrine 'Panchosiddh' near the town of Partabgarh, gave birth to a son, Lakhan Sen.\n\n\"The pargana of Aror.\u2014The pargana now called Partabgarh was then known as Aror, and was held by Bhars and Raikwar Chhattis. Lakhan Sen, grown up, got from the king the raj of the Aror pargana in lieu of Jhusi, and subdued or expelled the proprietors. This was about 666 fasli (1258 A.D.). The village of Hindaur, some twelve miles from Bela; and lying on the main road to Rae Bareli, was the residence of Lakhan Sen. A high commanding mound is now clearly visible from a great distance, and is pointed out as the site of his castle.\n\n\"Malik Singh.\u2014He had three sons, Gohanwar Deo, Malik Singh, and Jait Singh. Gohanwar begot Udhran Deo, and wished to transfer his\n\n* For an account of Jhusi and the Raja Harbong who dwelt there, see Elliott's Glossary under \"Harbong-ka-raj.\"\npower to him while he himself yet lived. Mal\u00fak Singh objected, and went to Delhi to get help, which he purchased by becoming a Musalman. He was appointed Subahdar of Allahabad, and married a princess of the imperial family. Thence he invaded his brother's dominions, and expelling the chief, desired to convert the whole clan of Sombanisis to the Muhammadan faith. This was too much for the mild Hindu, and Mal\u00fak was proscribed. Gohanw\u00e1r Deo agreed with his brother, Jait Singh, that the title and estates should be the prize of him who should kill the apostate invader. Hereon Jait Singh affected to desert to Mal\u00fak's side, and being taken into his confidence, assassinated him and his wife at a place called Phulw\u00e1ri near Partabgarh. Their tomb is now to be seen in the village called Teonga at a place called Phulw\u00e1ri. Thus the younger brother became r\u00e1ja, and the elder took the title of b\u00e1b\u00fa, and an estate of twenty-four villages. His son, Udhran Deo, is the ancestor of the now existing families of Suj\u00e1khar, Chilbila, Gaurad\u00e1nd, Chhatarpur, and Gonda.\n\n\"R\u00e1m Singh.\u2014Jait Singh Deo left a son, K\u00e1nh Deo, who had four sons\u2014R\u00e1m Singh, K\u00e1nh Singh, Gy\u00e1n Singh, and Pirthmi Singh. R\u00e1m Singh had five sons, whose descendants hold the estates Baniamau, Chatmau, (lately decreed to one R\u00e1e Nand Kum\u00e1r, an ex-chakladar, and who seems likely to have but a bad bargain in his estate), Mahri Sip\u00e1h, and Barista. R\u00e1m Singh's four sons are now represented by the owners of Kamaipur, Achalpur, Sahodrpur, Karanpur, and Ajgara.\n\n\"R\u00e1ja Pirthmi Singh.\u2014Gy\u00e1n Singh's progeny are in Ankodhia and Lakh\u00e1pur. The youngest son, Pirthmi, succeeded to the r\u00e1j. His grandson, Sult\u00e1n S\u00e1h, led a force in aid of the Dehli emperor, then warring in the south of India. His exertions were crowned with success, and in return he acquired from the emperor a grant of the parganas Soraon, Sikandra, Nahw\u00e1i, and Kiw\u00e1i in the Allahabad district. His paternal estate of Aror was made over to him in j\u00e1gfr tenure, and the title of R\u00e1hbardar Khan conferred on him. A service was at the same time imposed on him which explains the title. He was required to escort the annual tribute of Bengal to Delhi.\n\n\"R\u00e1ja Gh\u00e1tam Deo.\u2014His youngest son succeeded him, and was the last younger son who did so. In the next generation Ghatsam Deo, the eldest of six sons, became r\u00e1ja. A younger brother, Morai Singh, is noteworthy as having been the husband of five wives and father of fifteen sons\u2014all of whom are still traceable in various villages.\n\n\"R\u00e1ja Sangr\u00e1m S\u00e1h and R\u00e1m Chand.\u2014\"Sangr\u00e1m S\u00e1h, the next r\u00e1ja, is noticeable for transferring the family residence from Hindaur to Aw\u00e1r in the Pirth\u00edganj il\u00e1qa. R\u00e1ja R\u00e1m Chand succeeded his father Sangr\u00e1m S\u00e1h, and was succeeded by \u0141achhm\u00ed Nar\u00e1in, who was followed by Tej Singh, noticeable for a second transfer of his residence to Tejgarh, now in the D\u00e1ndikachh Il\u00e1qa.\n\n\"R\u00e1ja Part\u00e1b Singh (change of name from Aror to Partabgarh).\u2014He had one son, Part\u00e1b Singh, who fixing his residence at a place till then known as R\u00e1mapur, built a great fort, and giving it his own name changed the\nname of the pargana from Aror to that of Partabgarh; he was murdered by the subahdar of Allahabad.\n\n\"R\u00e1ja Jai Singh.\u2014Jai Singh succeeded Part\u00e1b Singh his father. He had a 'chel\u00e1,' Bakht Bali Singh, who was deputed to represent him at the court of Delhi. There he was fortunate enough to defeat and capture a Bundela rebel, Chatur S\u00e1l, and the emperor conferred on his master the privilege of wearing a 'topi' in darb\u00e1r (in lieu of the usual 'pagri'), which brought the title of 'Kul\u00e1hnares'* to the Partabgarh r\u00e1ja. A more substantial reward was the grant of the parganas Mungra and Garwara\u2020 in Jaunpur. He proceeded to Benares to confer the title of r\u00e1ja on the Gautam lord of that city.\n\n\"R\u00e1ja Chhatardh\u00e1ri Singh.\u2014Jai Singh reigned for seventy-five years and added much to the fort of Partabgarh. His son, Chhatardh\u00e1ri, succeeded him, and his sons may be traced in various villages. One, Medni Singh, is identified with the large bazar of Katra Medni Singh close by Partabgarh. In Chhatardhari's time, the parganas which, it would appear, had been immediately under the Allahabad authorities, were transferred to the Oudh Government, and the new ruler wrested from him the parganas of Nahwai, Kiw\u00e1i, Mungra, and Garwara, leaving Partabgarh, Soraon, and Sikandra.\n\n\"R\u00e1ja Pirth\u00edpat.\u2014Pirth\u00edpat, second son of Chhatardhari, was the next r\u00e1ja. He cruelly murdered the son of a M\u00e1nikpur banker, who refused (probably with good reason) to send him money. The banker had influence enough with the Delhi Court to get an order issued to Mans\u00far Ali Khan, Subahdar of Oudh (otherwise known as Safdar Janj and successor of Sa\u00e1dat Kh\u00e1n, Burh\u00e1n-ul-Mulk, the founder of the Oudh dynasty), to punish the murderer. This was accomplished by treachery near Gutni on the Ganges in this district, the r\u00e1ja being assassinated in darb\u00e1r. The vast estates were then confiscated, and revenue engagements were made with the villagers. Duni\u00e1pat, son of Pirth\u00edpat, recovered the Partabgarh pargana, but Soraon and Sikandra have never since been in the hands of this family. He proved intractable, and two Government officials, Ism\u00e1il Beg Khan and Taqi Beg Khan, were deputed to chastise him. They drove him from his estate, and pursuing him hotly killed him at Badwal in the Sikandra pargana. This was the end of the Partabgarh r\u00e1j as co-extensive with the pargana; and the history which has hitherto been confined to the fortunes of one leading family will, if pursued, be found to embrace those of several families who are now the taluqdars of the pargana.\n\n* \"From 'kul\u00e1h' cap (in Persian) and 'nares' a king (in Sanskrit). A similar distinction, but of a far inferior degree in consequence of the rank of the donor, was conferred by the king of Oudh on the r\u00e1ja of Amethi. The r\u00e1ja of Partabgarh is still known in the pargana as the Kulaira R\u00e1ja, and it is said that the identical cap (kul\u00e1h) is or was in the possession of R\u00e1ja Chhatarp\u00e1i Singh, of N\u00e1rpur, who is the true descendant of the old Partabgarh stock.\"\n\n\u2020 \"The story is told that the R\u00e1ja of Garwara opposing the transfer of his property to a stranger fought the Partabgarh R\u00e1ja and was beaten. To express contempt for his foe the victor got a jackal, named it Shid\u00e9\u00e9s, and put it on the gaddi, and kept the unfortunate animal there for twelve years, when I suppose the beast died.\"\n\"The Estate of Bahlolpur.\u2014Duni\u00e9pat left no issue, but he had two illegitimate brothers, Bah\u00e1dur Singh and Mohkam Singh. His widow, Kusal Kunwar, survived him. Bah\u00e1dur Singh ingratiated himself with the n\u00e1zim and got something allowed for his maintenance. In 1205 fasli, he got the village of Bahlolpur, and, having a nucleus, he aggregated other villages. He had no issue, and covenanted with Kusal Kunwar that she should adopt some suitable person. Shiuratan Singh of Karoin and Tarwal was selected, and Bah\u00e1dur Singh wrote a deed of agreement to bequeath the estate to Shiuratan. Shortly after Bah\u00e1dur Singh fell ill, and while he was in a state of collapse, his wife, S\u00e1gund Kunwar, adopted her sister's son, Shamsher Bah\u00e1dur Singh, of the Sar\u00e1e An\u00e1deo family, descended from Morai Singh; Bah\u00e1dur Singh disapproved of his wife's act. Kusal Kunwar adopted Shiuratan in all due form and got him acknowledged a r\u00e1ja, and a cash allowance sanctioned for his maintenance; nevertheless Shamsher Bah\u00e1dur succeeded to Bah\u00e1dur Singh's estate. Dh\u00edr Singh, son of Shiuratan Singh, got the cash allowance of his father converted into a grant of twenty villages, now known as the N\u00farpur il\u00e1qa. These are settled with his grandson, Chit-p\u00e1l Singh, in whom the British Government has admitted the right to assume the hereditary title of r\u00e1ja.\n\n\"The Saw\u00e1nsa estate.\u2014To complete the annals of the Partabgarh, or rather of the Bahlolpur family, as it had now become, it may be as well to relate that Pirth\u00edpat had a younger brother, Hind\u00fapat, who after Duni\u00e9pat's death became a convert to Muhammadanism, and took the name of Sarfar\u00e1z Ali Khan. Before this he had begotten an illegitimate son, Udit Singh, who was father of Bhairon Bakhsh and Sftal, and they are still to be found in the Saw\u00e1nsa estate, in the Patti tahsil. This estate, which had been acquired by the Partabgarh family from the Dal\u00edppur family by marriage, was conferred by the authorities on Hind\u00fapat as the reward of his apostacy from the Hindu faith.\n\n\"Revenue of pargana Partabgarh.\u2014In 1262 fasli, or just before annexation, the pargana of Partabgarh included 983\u00bd villages, eight chaks, and two 'mazras' (hamlets), and 1,263 bighas, which were not included in any village on the rent-roll. I have not been able to find out the revenue demand of this pargana in the day of Todar Mal, but report fixes the amount at one lac of rupees. It was formerly included in the Allahabad Subah, but when that province passed into British hands in 1800, Partabgarh became a part of Oudh as chakla Partabgarh, and was subsequently included in the niz\u00e1mat of Sultanpur. It was heavily assessed in the following years:\n\n| Year | A.D. | Rs.   | a. p. |\n|------|------|-------|-------|\n| 1210 | 1792 | 2,66,436 | 0 0 |\n| 1236 | 1818 | 2,77,000 | 0 0 |\n| 1238 | 1820 | 2,16,426 | 0 0 |\n| 1240 | 1822 | 2,77,086 | 0 0 |\n| 1253 | 1844 | 3,05,772 | 0 0 |\n| 1255 | 1847 | 2,11,955 | 0 0 |\n\nIt is now assessed at 2,64,457 0 0\n\nAt annexation it was assessed at 1,72,944 6 0\nThere used to be a revenue of nearly Rs. 40,000 realised from salt works.\n\n\"Other landed castes.\u2014There are very few Musalman landowners; some of these are circumcised K\u00e1yaths, who in the days of Alamgir embraced the Moslem faith. They are now known as Shekhs. There are a few Path\u00e1n families, as in Bahlolpur and Purai Mustafa Khan. They acquired their properties in service either of the Sombansi or the Government. The Brahman zamindars owe their land to grants from the Chhatris. The Bilkharia Chhattirs beaten out of Patti are still to be found in Partabgarh. Ten villages paying a revenue of Rs. 6,970 form the two estates of the R\u00e1ja of Umri and the B\u00e1bu of Ant\u00fa.\n\n\"Chakladar's Camp.\u2014The Chakladar's camp used to be pitched at Hindaur and Nawabganj on the north of the Sai (on the Allahabad and Fyzabad road), at Sandwa Chandika, and a kind of standing camp was at Partabgarh, in the fort of which place 1,000 men, two guns, and some cavalry were the usual garrison.\"\n\nPlaces of note.\u2014Of places of antiquarian interest in this pargana I proceed to notice Partabgarh, Hindaur, and the old shrine of \"Panchosiddh,\" which is situated within the limits of mauza Banb\u00edrk\u00e1chhi.\n\nPartabgarh\u2014To begin with the town of Partabgarh. It is said that in or about the year 1617 A.D., R\u00e1ja Part\u00e1b Singh, when at the zenith of his power, founded the town and gave it his own name. During the rule of his son, R\u00e1ja Jai Singh (A.D. 1682 to 1718), and after the establishment of a permanent fort, the Governor Piru, of the Allahabad Subah, arrived in the neighbourhood, and encamping on the land of mauza Mahkini, laid siege to the fort. Though details are wanting in this respect, there can be little doubt but that this was one of those frequent raids made by Government officials against the taluqdars of Oudh, which were prompted by the growing wealth, power, and independence of the latter. Contumelious behaviour in not paying up the Government revenue demand was the ordinary and plausible pretext for these not unfrequently wanton attacks on the part of the local Government. To return to our tale, the siege is asserted to have dragged on its weary length for no less a period than twelve years, and still the raja and his gallant band held out. His patience becoming exhausted, the Governor commenced to run an underground gallery from his camp to the fort as a means of effecting his object. These operations were discovered by the besieged, and no time was lost in countermining. A shaft was sunk on the north side of the besiegers' gallery, and in it were deposited several cases of gunpowder. Just as the attacking force arrived at this spot the match was applied. The results may be imagined. Disappointed in this his last hope, the governor raised the siege and removed his camp to the neighbouring village of Teonga. Here the raja flushed with his late success determined to give the enemy battle, and fortune still befriending him in the engagement which ensued, his opponent was killed and his forces dispersed. Vestiges of the gallery above alluded to are still to be seen.\nDecay of the town.\u2014From the time of the defeat and death of R\u00e1ja Duni\u00e1pat described above, the town of Partabgarh lost its former prestige and gradually became less populous: and soon afterwards Nawab Mans\u00far Ali Khan alias Safdar Jang commanded an \"Ahalk\u00e1r\" to take possession of the fort in his name. Two years afterwards, Sikandar S\u00e1h, brother of R\u00e1ja Pirth\u00edpat, came down with a considerable force and wrested the fort from the Nawab's troops. He only occupied it however for six months, as in a second engagement he was defeated and driven out of the pargana. After the lapse of another five years, R\u00e1ja Balbhaddar Singh, son of R\u00e1ja Pirth\u00edpat, who had taken up his residence in Rewah, came down and recovered the fort after a severe contest. Subsequently he took part with L\u00e1l Balwant Singh, Taluqdar of R\u00e1mpur, in a dispute between the latter and the n\u00e1s\u00edm, at which the n\u00e1s\u00edm was so incensed that he marched against Partabgarh and overthrew the raja in battle. The fort fell into the n\u00e1s\u00edm's hands, and from that time up to 1263 fasli (1856 A.D.) it remained in possession of the Government officials. Chakladars were permitted to reside in it.\n\nHindaur.\u2014Hindaur is fifteen miles from the civil station on the Rae Bareli road. The name of this place is popularly ascribed to a \"R\u00e1chchhas\" or demon named Handavi, who is believed to have founded the old qasba in the pre-historic period. The legend, as currently believed and narrated, is that Bhim Sen, one of the sons of the marvellous R\u00e1ja P\u00e1ndu,* once came to Hindaur and fought with Handavi. The latter was defeated, and thereupon bestowed his daughter in marriage on the conqueror. The issue of this union is asserted to be that section of the Sombansi clan known as \"Chaw\u00e1na,\" a remnant of which tribe is still to be seen in manza Kusph\u00e1ra, a \"mufrad\" village some fourteen or fifteen miles to the east of Hindaur. They are mere cultivators, however, without any rights in the soil. Hindaur is remarkable as having been the battle-field of the Kanhpurias under S\u00farat Singh, and the Sombansis under Part\u00e1b Singh, when the former were defeated; and as the alleged residence of Lakhan Sen, the conqueror of the Bhars and Raikw\u00e1rs (A.D. 1258). Hindaur was a large and populous place until about a century ago when it began to fall into decay. The main cause of its decline appears to have been the removal of its trade to Phulpur in the Allahabad district, occasioned by the excessive exactions in the way of imposts levied under the later rulers\n\n* From the \"Khul\u00e1s-tut-taw\u00e1r\u00edkh,\" a Persian translation of the \"Mah\u00e1bharat,\" I find the following account of R\u00e1ja P\u00e1ndu. There was once upon a time a certain R\u00e1ja Mahip of Hastamapur (one of the lunar race of P\u00e1ndu). He had two sons\u2014Bider, who was blind and the offspring of a slave girl, and P\u00e1ndu. The latter succeeded his father as ruler. One day he went out shooting and saw a buck and doe antelope together. He put an arrow to his bow and shot the buck, which on closer examination was found to be not a deer but a faqir! The latter in dying cursed the raja, and warned him that he would meet with a violent death, if found under similar circumstances. Alarmed beyond measure, the raja left his dominions and fled with his four wives to the hills, and there took up his residence. Remembering the faqir's curse he lived to old age without children. He then directed his wives to go forth and raise up seed to him, as otherwise he would die without issue, and thus perish everlastingingly. They refused to do as he wished, so he then shut each up separately in a certain chamber or \"kothri,\" and prayed heaven to assist him. The first wife who went in, named Kunti, came out pregnant, and bore three sons, named Sh\u00edrm, Arjuna, and Judh\u00e1str. A second named M\u00e1ndri, was likewise favoured and bore two sons, named S\u00e1h Deo and Nakul. Judh\u00e1str married Duropadi, daughter of R\u00e1ja R\u00e1j\u00e1v\u00e1, of Hindu celebrity, and Bhim defeated the R\u00e1chchhas Handavi, and married his daughter as described above.\nof the Partabgarh r\u0101j. It is now but a village with an average population; nevertheless the remains still extant sufficiently attest its former greatness. The ruins of the old fort (said to have been built by the R\u0101chchhas Handavi) are still traceable. Hindaur was one of the regular encamping grounds of the n\u0101zims.\n\nPanchosiddh.\u2014This shrine is situated at the junction of the waters of the Sakarni and Sai about a mile and a half from the town of Partabgarh. It has attained its celebrity from the following fabulous narrative. Many years ago five Sombansis, of different villages, used to meet and perform their devotions at this spot. One day they agreed to cut off their heads (how the last man managed to decapitate himself and arrange all the heads is not stated, and perhaps it would not be wise to enquire), and piling them together to offer them to Durga Debi. No sooner said than done. The heads in course of time turned to stone, and these stones were to be seen until four years ago when they suddenly disappeared. The place was named \"Panchosiddh\" or the \"vow of the five fulfilled.\" Every Tuesday the shrine is visited by a few persons from the neighbourhood; a goat is usually sacrificed, and offerings made of cakes, grain, pice, &c. There is also a celebrated shrine in the village of Sandwa Chandika, known as Chandika Debi.\n\nDetailed account of the death of R\u0101ja Pirth\u012bpat.\u2014I cannot pass on without noting an error (though a popular one), by which Mr. King has been misled, in connection with the death of R\u0101ja Pirth\u012bpat of Partabgarh. According to the \"Taw\u0101r\u012bkh Zah\u016br Qutubi,\" Vol. II., the following is, I believe, the correct and historical account of the occurrence. It appears that in A.D. 1750-61, during the Rohilla invasion, Ahmad Khan, Bangash,* of Farukhabad, in revenge for the seizure of his brother's property by Nawab Safdar Jang, the Wazir, directed K\u0101le Khan, whom he had nominated as Naib Subahdar of Allahabad, to proceed at once with an army and attack Muhammad Quli Khan, the Wazir's nephew, who was in charge of the fort at Allahabad. Accordingly K\u0101le Khan, and Usman Khan, his nephew, proceeded to invest the fort of Allahabad. R\u0101ja Pirth\u012bpat, whose disposition towards Safdar Jang was anything but friendly, went and allied his forces to those of the Nawab of Farukhabad. K\u0101le Khan succeeded in securing a footing in the city, but failed to obtain possession of the fort. Meanwhile the forces of the Wazir and of Ahmad Khan Bangash had come into collision at Farukhabad, on which occasion the latter had sustained a signal defeat. Hearing this R\u0101ja Pirth\u012bpat withdrew with his men from Allahabad and returned to Partabgarh.\n\nNawab Safdar Jang, greatly enraged at the overt act of hostility on the part of his subject, resolved to be revenged. Accordingly when encamped at Gutni on the banks of the Ganges, he sent word to R\u0101ja Pirth\u012bpat to come and visit him. Suspecting the Nawab's designs, Pirth\u012bpat refused to obey. Thereupon Safdar Jang wrote and declared on oath, that he intended the r\u0101ja no evil, and at the same time promised, in the event of compliance, to give him the Fanjdarship of M\u0101nikpur, a post which\n\n* The Bangash are an Afghan tribe.\nhad been long coveted by Pirth\u00edpat. Deluded with these specious premises, and by the more substantial bait held out to him, R\u00e1ja Pir-th\u00edpat, accompanied by 1,000 sabres, started for Gutni. Nawab Safdar Jang received him with every appearance of cordiality, presented him with a sanad for the coveted post, and, directing a \"khilat\" to be given him, requested him to go into an adjoining tent and robe himself. At the same time he secretly directed Ali Beg Khan, Ch\u00e1rchin, to follow and assassinate him. Accordingly Ali Beg Khan followed the r\u00e1ja into the tent, and on pretence of congratulating him on his good fortune, sprang upon him and endeavoured to throw him down. Pirth\u00edpat was the more powerful man of the two, and in the struggle which ensued fell uppermost, whereupon Ali Beg Khan, quick as thought, snatched a dagger from the r\u00e1ja's girdle and stabbed him with it mortally. The R\u00e1ja, after inflicting a severe wound in his adversary's face with his teeth, fell back a corpse.\n\nThe annals of the clan are remarkable and instructive. They have always disregarded two maxims supposed to be of primary force, purity of blood and indivisibility of estate. It is mentioned in the family annals as an exceptional incident that the line of Mallapur is of pure descent; its scions being all the sons of wives. It does not appear, however, that any division took place in the way of partition of the inheritance. The younger brothers were provided with a village or two, which small patriarchies they proceeded to enlarge by every means in their power, and specially by picking up stray villages after their r\u00e1ja was murdered. Thus the Suj\u00e1khar lord commencing with 24 villages in 1778, added twelve more, and from 1828 to 1855 forty more, finally acquiring an estate of 110 villages, and losing half of it for concealing cannon in 1859. The Sombansi have 360 taluqdari, 154 zamindari, and 85 sub-tenures. No other clan can boast such a fair distribution of property, and such a good basis for future prosperity. Most of its chiefs are kind and liberal men.\n\nPARTABGARH\u2014Pargana PARTABGARH\u2014Tahsil PARTABGARH\u2014District PARTABGARH.\u2014Partabgarh lies in latitude 25\u00b053' north, and longitude 81\u00b059' east. It was founded in 1618 A.D. by R\u00e1ja Part\u00e1b Singh; it is on the metalled road to Allahabad, 36 miles distant, 56 from Rae Bareli, and 24 from Sultanpur. The general history of the town is given under that of the pargana. There is a fine old fort here built by the r\u00e1ja, but seized 90 years ago by the Government. The British Government has now sold it to R\u00e1ja Aj\u00edt Singh, a relative of the ancient owner. It was of considerable size, but its outer wall and flanking works were knocked down after the mutiny; an inner keep and little walled garden still remain. It is a favourable specimen of Hindu architecture. The population is 3,743. There are six mosques, and four temples to Mah\u00e1deo, which in addition to the fort are the only masonry buildings. The annual sales in the bazar are about Rs. 5,000; very good sugar is made here. This place gives its name to the district, tahsil, and pargana, and is four miles from Bela, the civil station. There is a Government high school, the registry, and other usual district offices.\nPASGAWAN Pargana *\u2014Tahsil Muhamdi\u2014District Kheri.\u2014The modern pargana Pasgawan was formed in 1869 A.D. by the amalgamation of the two older parganas, Pasgawan and Barw\u00e1r. It is bounded on the north by the Muhamdi pargana, on the east by the river Gumti, on the south by the Hardoi district, and is separated from the Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur district on the west by the Sukheta nadi. Besides the last mentioned channel and the Gumti river, which is here a well conducted stream, with an undulating sandy margin, Pasgawan is drained by two high banked water courses, each of which bears the name of Ch\u00e1ha, and by a string of jhils, whose waste waters, commingled during the rains, flow from the north-west corner through the pargana into the Hardoi district.\n\nThe soil is generally of the better kind; yet much uncleared jungle remains, specially in the south-west; and of a total area of 118 square miles, only 35,479 acres were found cultivated at survey (1866 A.D.).\n\nThe population is 40,741, a rate of 336 to the square mile. Cham\u00e1rs, P\u00e1s\u00eds, Ah\u00edrs, and Brahmans, whose occupation is chiefly agricultural or pastoral, contributed the largest numbers to the census. There are no large towns or important bazars. The local trade is on a petty scale, yet the military road affords facilities for such traffic as there is with Sitapur and Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur.\n\nAfter the dissolution of the great Barw\u00e1r estate, settlement was made with independent zamindari bodies, who escaping the fate of the small proprietors of the neighbouring pargana, Atwa Piparia, have for the most part retained their villages. Thus the number of demarcated mauzas being 163, the small proprietors hold 142, while 21 are taluqdari.\n\nThe present revenue demand is Rs. 60,523.\n\nPASGAWAN\u2014Pargana Pasgawan\u2014Tahsil Muhamdi\u2014District Kheri.\u2014This village is situated on a level plain of fine soil, having its sides studded with groves, tanks, and Hindu temples. It lies in latitude 27\u00b050' north, longitude 80\u00b013' east. There are four temples, one mosque, one mud-built fort, and a sar\u00e1e. The fort and sar\u00e1e were built by Hakim Mehndi Ali during his chakladarship of Muhamdi (1799\u20141820). They are now in ruins. It has a sugar manufactory and a market (on Wednesdays and Saturdays). The average annual sales amount to Rs. 1,625. Population, 1,125,\n\n| Hindu | 946 | Muhammadans | 179 |\n|-------|-----|-------------|-----|\n| Males | 521 | Males       | 104 |\n| Females | 425 | Females    | 75 |\n\nPATAN Pargana\u2014Tahsil Purwa\u2014District Unao.\u2014This pargana is bounded on the north by Magr\u00e1yar, Purwa, and Panhan, on the east by Panhan and Bih\u00e1r, on the west by Magr\u00e1yar, and on the south by Bhagwantnagar. Its area is 11 square miles or 6,910 acres divided into 15 mauzas (villages). In shape it is a parallelogram, 4 miles in breadth from east to west, and 3 in length from north to south. The soil is principally loam. The river Gurdhoi, a tributary of the Ganges, passing through\n\n* By Mr. T. R. Redfern, C.S., Assistant Commissioner.\nvillages Birha, S\u00e1tanpur, and R\u00e1lipur, and other villages of this pargana, of Bhagwantnagar and Daundia Khera, falls into the river Ganges at a spot in village Duroli Khiera in pargana Daundia Khera. The irrigation is, as a rule, effected from wells; the water is found at an average depth of 50 feet. The climate of the pargana is salubrious and suited to the constitutions of the residents who are generally healthy. In the village of P\u00e1tan a market is held on Saturdays and Wednesdays. An unmetalled road from Bih\u00e1r to Cawnpore passes through this pargana and through that of Magr\u00e1yar. The Government revenue is Rs. 16,258; the rate per acre being Rs. 2-5-8. The tenure is as follows:\n\n| Taluqdari | Zamindari |\n|-----------|-----------|\n|           |           |\n|           |           |\n\nThe population consists of almost all castes, but Brahmans and Bais of the higher, and Kurmis of the lower caste, are the chief proprietary body, and form the most numerous class. Of Muhammadans there are very few.\n\nThe total population is 5,842, comprising 5,671 Hindus and 171 Musalmans, composed as follows:\n\n| Castes     | Number |\n|------------|--------|\n| Brahmans   | 9,004  |\n| Chhattris  | 383    |\n| K\u00e1yaths    | 164    |\n| Ban\u00edans    | 59     |\n| Ahirs      | 244    |\n| Other castes | 2,837 |\n| **Total**  | **5,671** |\n| Musalmans  | 171    |\n| **Grand Total** | **5,842** |\n\nTwo fairs are held annually; one is held in the month of P\u00e1s (December-January) and the other in Jeth (May-June) on the first Thursday of the month in honour of and near the tomb of Muhabbat Shah. This darvesh lived in the time of Shuj\u00e1-ud-daula, and died in that of \u00c1sif-ud-daula. He is said to have come to this place on pilgrimage. It is related that Muhabbat Shah had a disciple or \"Mur\u00edd\" known as Ni\u00e1mat Shah, whom he was very partial to. Ni\u00e1mat Shah died and was buried in this \"takia\"* (grave-yard), and therefore, in commemoration of his name, Muhabbat ordered a fair to be held over his tomb, which is still kept up. The majority of the people, whether Hindus or Muhammadans, have faith in him; and the cause of Ni\u00e1mat's death is related by the neighbours as follows:\u2014One day a Kurmi on his way home from the fields fell accidentally into a dry well, called out Muhabbat's name for help to take him out of the well, as he had faith in him and considered him present everywhere, but without any result; he then called Ni\u00e1mat, who instantly appeared, took him by the hand, and drew him out of the well. The next day the\n\n* The fair is well known in the vicinity, and is generally called \"Takia-ka-mela.\"\nsame Kurmi attended the darvesh's lodging, but saluted Ni\u00e1mat Shah only, and on being asked why, he related the matter in full; then Muhabbat getting enraged with his disciple, Ni\u00e1mat, ordered him to die which command he directly fulfilled.\n\nThe second fair or mela in (May-June) was established by Muhabbat's disciple, Shafqat Shah, in honour of his religious master.\n\nThis pargana was, prior to its being held by the Bais Ohhattris, in the possession of Bhars, though it was considered as forming part of the Kanauj kingdom. In the Nawabi the site of the tahsil was on the western side of this town, where a tahsildar resided, who had also the charge of the th\u00e1na or police station. It was formed into a pargana by Akbar Shah, deriving its name from the town P\u00e1tan.\n\nP\u00c1TAN\u2014Pargana PATAN\u2014Tahsil PURWA\u2014District UNAO.\u2014The principal village of pargana P\u00e1tan, district Unao. The river Lon flows past the little town which has a population of 2,373, a temple dedicated to Mah\u00e1deo, and a school attended by forty-two pupils. The tomb of a faq\u00edr, Muhabbat Shah, whose spirit is supposed to exercise those into whom satan has entered, attracts two annual fairs. One a little one in March, at which about 2,000 people congregate, the other is held in September, and sometimes 70,000 persons assemble including many taluqdars. The insane are tied in hundreds to trees opposite the tomb, left all night, and it is said benefit thereby.\n\nPATTI\u2014Pargana PATTI\u2014Tahsil PATTI\u2014District PARTABGARH.\u2014This village, which is also the seat of a tahsil, is on the road from Bela to Ch\u00e1nda, in the district of Sultanpur. The place is called so from the division which took place between the Bachgotis. It is thirteen miles from Partabgarh and thirty-six from Allahabad. The population amounts to 1,584. There are two mosques and one school. There are a th\u00e1na and tahsil.\n\nPATTI DALIPPUR Pargana\u2014Tahsil PATTI\u2014District PARTABGARH.\u2014This large pargana at the south-eastern extremity of Oudh, bordering on the Jaunpur district, is conterminous with the tahsil of the same name; it was originally called Jak\u00edpur Bilkhar. It covers 468 square miles, of which 217 are cultivated; its population is 223,173 or 477 to the square mile; of these 36,517 are Brahmins, 16,237 are Chhattris, 29,222 are Ahirs, 26,390 are Cham\u00e1rs, 25,380 are Kurmis. Of these Chhattris 6,605 are Bachgotis, but a very large number of them are alleged to be of impure blood, and have no share on the property of the clan.\n\nThere are ten Bachgoti taluqdars having among them 683 villages, and a numerous body of shareholders, with thirty-five villages and only 14 copyholds among them.\n\nThere are 900 Bilkhariyas, but all the eight villages belong to one man.\n\nThere are 406 Dirgbansis, but the fourteen Dirgbansi villages belong to one small taluqdar; the rest of the Chhattris have no proprietary rights.\nThe following extracts are taken from the settlement report:\u2014\n\nMangil Chhattirs are the original zamindars of Patti Dalippur, a family still exists in Adh\u00e1rganj.\n\nLanded castes.\u2014Pargana Patti Dalippur, as it now exists, includes 816 villages.

There are less Muhammadans in this tahsil than in any one of the other three tahsils of the district.\n\nThe Bilkhar\u00edas.\u2014At the time of the Rajput colonization, after the fall of Kanauj, and the dispersion of the Dikhit colony of Samoni, Ghaibar S\u00e1h,* fourth son of Jaswant, and great grandson of Balbhaddar Dikhit, migrated into Oudh, took possession of the fort known as \u201cKot Bilkhar\u201d in mauza Bilkhar (now included within the limits of mauza Ayy\u00e1pur on the left bank of the Sai), and settled there. His descendants came to be known as Bilkhar\u00edas. Whether this name was assumed from the place itself or from a famous Mah\u00e1deo (still to be seen at the spot), called \u201cBilkharn\u00e1th,\u201d which was enshrined therein, must for ever remain doubtful. At this point I shall allow Mr. King to take up the history of the pargana.\n\n\u201cThe Bachgotis.\u2014Imperial hostility, which caused the destruction of the Bhars, indirectly led to the next scene of the drama. Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn\n\n* Mr. C. A. Elliot, in his chronicles of Oonao, gives the name as Khvrdj, but this I believe to be incorrect.\nKhilji's wrath was kindled against the Chauh\u00e1n Chhattirs of Mainpuri, and he vowed their destruction. These Chauh\u00e1ns were formerly known as 'Batsgotis,' a name derived from a saint named 'Bats,' the founder of their race. To this old name the devoted clan recurred to conceal their prescribed name of Chauh\u00e1n; and hence came a clan of Chhattirs now known as 'Bachgotis.' Two members of this clan migrated eastward; and native history records that in the month of Sawan 1252 Sambat (about 1200 A.D.) Bari\u00e1r Singh, Bachgoti, came with his brother K\u00e1h\u00ed Singh from Delhi, two adventurers apparently, in search of service or of plunder. K\u00e1h\u00ed Singh proceeded to Bengal, and I am not aware whether his fortunes can be traced; but Bari\u00e1r Singh entered the service of R\u00e1ja R\u00e1mdeo, the Bilkharia lord of not only Patti but much other land in the neighbourhood. Bari\u00e1r Singh rose to be the chief military officer under his master; and his ambition was encouraged by his marriage to R\u00e1ja R\u00e1mdeo's daughter. It is said that the raja, on the approach of death, advised his son, Dalpat S\u00e1h, to rid himself of so formidable a subject; but the letter containing this advice fell into Bari\u00e1r Singh's hand, and he anticipated the treacherous counsel by putting Dalpat S\u00e1h to death, and seizing the estate for himself. Another account is that he was peaceably married to R\u00e1mdeo's daughter and heiress, and thus succeeded his father-in-law. This story sounds tame in comparison with the other, which should in the interests of history be preferred.\n\n\"Bari\u00e1r Singh and his descendants.\u2014Bari\u00e1r Singh being thus master of the vast estates of the Bilkharia, becomes the starting point in our history, which will be occupied in following the fortunes of one part of his descendants. Before however doing this, I will give a brief account of his immediate issue with their present positions. Bari\u00e1r Singh had four sons\n\n\"First.\u2014Asal Singh, from whom is named a pargana in Sultanpur.\n\n\"Second.\u2014Gajr\u00e1j, or G\u00fange, whose descendants are called Rajw\u00e1rs, and live in the Ch\u00e1nda pargana of Sultanpur, in taluqas R\u00e1mpur and G\u00e1rapur, &c.\n\n\"Third.\u2014Gh\u00e1tam R\u00e1e, whose few descendants can now only be found in the Kam\u00edpur, S\u00edkri, and Barha villages of Dal\u00edppur, and Mahr\u00e1ipur of pargana Patti.\n\n\"Fourth.\u2014R\u00e1j Singh, who inherited such portions of the estate as were not disposed of among the above. Though the youngest, he succeeded to the title.\n\n\"R\u00e1j Singh and his descendants.\u2014The descendants of R\u00e1j Singh deserve a passing notice, as they are now to be identified as the taluqdars of some important estates.\n\n\"First.\u2014Chakrpati, the youngest, succeeded his father in Patti, &c.\n\n\"Second.\u2014R\u00fap Singh, whose descendants are now taluqdars of Hasanpur in Sultanpur, and having become Musalmans are known as Kh\u00e1n-\nThe story of their conversion to Moslem faith is variously told, and I will not trespass on a domain of fable which strictly belongs to my contemporary, the Settlement Officer of Sultanpur.\n\n\"Third.\u2014Asneh Singh, whose descendants, under the name of Rajkumar, are in the estates of Dera and Meopur in Fyzabad. The younger son having succeeded to his father's estate becomes a fresh starting point. Chakrpati had two sons; Bahubar, whose descendants are to be found in the Ateksan ilaq of twelve villages, which however has not maintained its independence, part having been absorbed into an estate in the Sultanpur district, and part having been re-united to the Patti Saifabad estates by mortgage some sixty years ago.\n\n\"Goshain Singh.\u2014Chakrpati Singh's second son was Goshain Singh, who had four sons.\n\n\"First.\u2014Harbans Rae, the youngest, succeeded to the title and estates.\n\n\"Second.\u2014Hamir Deo or Haram Deo Singh, whose descendants are in an independent village called Sirsi, and in Sarai Jamwari in the ilaq of Madhopur.\n\n\"Third.\u2014Karan Pal Singh, whose descendants are in Ujla and Mahdi of pargana Dalippur.\n\n\"Fourth.\u2014Lakhan Sen Rae, whose posterity are in Sheosat and Phenhan; the former an independent village, and the latter in the Adharganj estate. Harbans Rae, the younger son, had two sons, Dingur Singh and Nahar Singh. Up to this time, the estate had gone by the name of Jalalpur Bilkhar; but on the death of their father the brothers divided the estate, and it is observable that if the chronicles are true, which say that up to this time the youngest son had been the usual successor of his father, they may be credited here in the reverse, and henceforth we shall find that the course of nature was followed, and the elder son succeeded to his father's estate and title. Dingur, elder son of Harbans, got 11-20ths in the division of the paternal estate, and Nahar Singh got 9-20ths. The former estate was called Dalippur, the latter Patti, and from the division the two parganas so named begin a separate existence.\n\n\"Chilbila.\u2014Dalippur has been lessened by the transfer of an estate called Chilbila to the estates and pargana of the Sombanai Chhatris in Partabgarh.\"\n\n\"Sonpura (Bais).\u2014Patti was increased by the annexation of thirty-six villages known as Muhal Sonpura on the extreme east of the district. This was effected by Diwan Sumer Singh in 1222 fasi; about fifteen other villages of Bajjalpur were acquired by him from Bais Chhatris, and the estates of Saifabad, fifty-two villages, were wrested from the Maliks (a Muhammadan family) by the same taluqdar. Both Patti and\n\n* The Raja of Kurwar is the present Hindu representative of Raj Singh.\nDal\u00edppur have been divided into several estates now held by their several owners.\n\n\"A few details will be given of the eldest branch of the family, which demands the first notice.\n\n\"Pargana Dal\u00edppur.\u2014Fifth in descent from D\u00edngur R\u00e1e, taluqdar of the pargana of Dal\u00edppur, was Suj\u00e1n R\u00e1e, who was succeeded by his son Gaj Singh. This taluqdar had two sons who survived him, R\u00e1e Buddh Singh and B\u00e1z Bah\u00e1dur. The latter procured a division of the paternal estate, and was the founder of the Dari\u00e1pur il\u00e1qa, the second in importance in this pargana.\n\n\"History of the Adh\u00e1rganj family.\u2014The history of the Dal\u00edppur (or as it is now called the Adh\u00e1rganj) family presents a succession of violent deaths.\n\n\"Suj\u00e1n R\u00e1e and his son, Gaj Singh, were killed by a Shekh family of the Machlishahr pargana in Jaunpur, which borders on the Dal\u00edppur pargana. R\u00e1e Buddh Singh (the chief of this house, who received the title of R\u00e1e from the Hasanpur R\u00e1ja of Sultanpur) joined Nawab Shuj\u00e1-ud-daula in his war with the British, which ended with his defeat at Buxar in 1764 A.D. Adhering to the fortunes of the Nawab, he is said to have been killed at the subsequent battle of Mahoka.\n\n\"R\u00e1e Meherb\u00e1n Singh.\u2014He was succeeded by R\u00e1e Bhaw\u00e1ni Singh, who was followed by his son, R\u00e1e Meherb\u00e1n Singh, who was the last of the family who held the pargana of Dal\u00edppur by a single revenue engagement. About 1780 A.D., this taluqdar fell into arrears, and adopting the usual policy fled beyond the Oudh border to Bindh\u00e1chal, south of the Ganges, in the Mirzapur district. He died very shortly after this, leaving three sons.\n\n1. R\u00e1e Bindeshuri Bakhsh.\n2. Chauh\u00e1rja Bakhsh.\n3. S\u00edlta Bakhsh.\n\n\"The three sons of Meherb\u00e1n Singh.\u2014True to their instinct, these brothers kept up such a reign of terror and disturbance, by plundering and murdering those who submitted to the officers of Government and made terms for the payment of the revenue, that they were soon permitted to return to their homes, and by degrees to acquire some considerable portions of their ancestral estate. R\u00e1e Bindeshuri Bakhsh acquired the following sections of the estate:\n\n| Adh\u00e1rganj, containing 36 villages. |\n| --- | --- |\n| Haweli, ditto 12 do. |\n| Kharb\u00e1r, ditto 22 do. |\n| W\u00e1ri, ditto 21 do. |\n\n\"He died about 1824 A.D., being killed by the Taluqdar of Patti Saf\u00e1bad of 9-20ths; and, being childless, was succeeded by his brother Chauh\u00e1rja Bakhsh, who recovered sixteen villages of the pargana, which\nhad been since R\u00e1e Meherb\u00e1n Singh's flight settled with the villagers. He died in 1844 and left no issue, save an illegitimate son and daughter by two women. The son, Bisheshwar, is provided for in the village of Mehdeori. The younger son of R\u00e1e Meherb\u00e1n then succeeded to the estate and died in 1852, but not before he had added four more villages to the estate by revenue engagement for them. He also got the village of Phenh\u00e1n by fighting the Madhopur taluqdar for it. He was succeeded by his son, K\u00e1lka, who died, as some say, by an accidental discharge of a pistol, but, as others say, by his own hand, in consequence of discovering his mother in an intrigue with a servant. He was followed in 1858 by his brother, the present taluqdar, R\u00e1e M\u00e1dho Parsh\u00e1d. The residence of the taluqdar is in the village of Dal\u00edppur, some six miles from the headquarters station, in a south-east direction.\"\n\n\"The Bachgoti clans.\u2014It will not be necessary here to recount the family annals of each of the houses of the Bachgoti clan. They would be found more fitly in a history of the landed families of the district. My object in the above sketch has been to give a clue connecting the chief house of the clan with the days of old, and to show how the other families have sprung from the parent stock.\n\n\"Kishna P\u00e1nde.\u2014I will devote a short space to the history of the Patti families in matters which, being of comparatively recent occurrence, may be of value to those whose duties require a knowledge of such annals. Sumer Singh, eighth in descent from N\u00e1har Singh (whence Patti as a separate property dates) was a minor when his father, Dh\u00edr Singh, died. His factotum was one Kishna P\u00e1nde, whose family fortress is still to be found in P\u00farai Shiu Parsh\u00e1d, in the village of Kohr\u00e1n in the Dasrathpur estate. He proved faithless. Instead of paying the revenue he embezzled it, and then got the engagement in his own hand, and ejected the hereditary master, who fled to Rewah. For twelve years Kishna reigned; but Sumer Singh, grown up, allied himself with the powerful R\u00e1ja of Partabgarh, and overthrew and slew the treacherous Brahman, whose posterity have acquired an under-proprietary title in P\u00farai Shiu Parsh\u00e1d from our settlement courts.\n\n\"The Dirgbansi.\u2014The pargana of Patti, as constituted till its recent consolidation with Dal\u00edppur, was a most remarkable instance of the conterminousness of the property of a clan with the limits of a pargana. There was not a single village in Patti which did not belong to a Bachgoti il\u00e1qa till recent arrangements included the Parhat estate of R\u00e1ja Mahesh Nar\u00e1in Dirgbansi* (fifteen villages) in the pargana. Neither was there one independent village. In Dal\u00edppur there are zamindars not Bachgotis, nor even Rajputs.\n\n\"The old Bilkharia clan has a few specimens still in Patti, chiefly in the northern portion in and about the now extinct Aurangabad taluqa, where they hold eight villages. The only two Bilkharia taluqas, those of the R\u00e1ja of Umri and the B\u00e1bu of Ant\u00fa, are and have been for many years included in the Partabgarh pargana, of which we shall speak presently.\n\n* \"The Dirgbansi is said to be really an offshoot of the Bilkharia clan, descended from Durg\u00e1j\u00e1s, second son of R\u00e1ja R\u00e1mdeo, abovementioned.\"\n\"Brahman zamindars, Gur\u00fas of Bachgotis.\u2014There are some Brahman zamindars in fifty-four villages, who, however, owe their lands to grants from the Bachgotis. They are Sarwaria Brahmans. The P\u00e1nde family is the hereditary Gur\u00fa family of the Bachgotis. The Patti family Gur\u00fas will be found in Asogpur. Those of Dal\u00edppur are in Padi\u00e1pur, now part of the village of Ratanmai.\n\n\"Three villages belong to Musalmans, who acquired them by service rendered to the Dal\u00edppur family.\"\n\n\"Position of Patti Dal\u00edppur under native rule.\u2014The tahsil of Patti was subordinate to the N\u00e1zim of Sultanpur. A chakladar used to be posted to the three parganas of Patti Dal\u00edppur and Partabgarh. His headquarters were at Partabgarh, and his usual camping grounds on his tours were in Bibipur close to Patti, Tarda, Sarabjitpur, W\u00e1ri, and Jogipur. It is not worth while to give details of each n\u00e1zm; I will notice only those whose administration or mal-administration produced results which are worth knowing.\n\n\"Battle of Jaisingarh.\u2014R\u00e1ja Hul's R\u00e1e (from 1201 to 1203 fasli) endeavoured to arrest Diw\u00e1n Zabar Singh of Patti taluqa in 1203 fasli, and an encounter took place in Jaisingarh, where the chieftain's fort was. Zabar Singh fled, and a P\u00e1nde Brahman, named Deoman of K\u00e1sapur, engaged for the payment of the revenue of the whole pargana for 1204-5 fasli. In 1206, Zabar Singh recovered his position. R\u00e1ja Bhaw\u00e1n\u00ed Parsh\u00e1d, who was n\u00e1zm for one year (1204 fasli), proceeded to coerce the Bais villages of Sonpura, and seized Ishri Bakhsh and Pargash Singh (both now alive) as a material guarantee. The Bais rose as one man, and attacking the n\u00e1zm, effected the release of their leaders before they were taken far. They then withdrew across the border into the Jaunpur district, but the removal of the n\u00e1zm from office enabled them to return to their homes very shortly.\n\n\"Battle of D\u00e1\u00fadpur.\u2014M\u00edr Ghul\u00e1m Husen (n\u00e1zm from 1226 to 1230 fasli), to punish R\u00e1e Pirth\u00edp\u00e1l Singh, Taluqdar of R\u00e1epur Bichhaur * for the murder of one Bah\u00e1dur L\u00e1il, a q\u00e1n\u00fango (father of present q\u00e1n\u00fango S\u00edtal Parsh\u00e1d), invested the fort of D\u00e1\u00fadpur, and for nineteen days the battle raged. On the 20th, Pirth\u00edp\u00e1l Singh fled, and for three years the estate was held 'kh\u00e1m.' Then the taluqdar's elder son, Jagmohan Singh, took the engagement for the estate for two years. In 1232 fasli, Pirth\u00edp\u00e1l Singh recovered it. Jagmohan is still alive; but from that time he has been an imbecile.\n\n\"Battle of Loh\u00e1r T\u00e1ra.\u2014In T\u00e1j-ud-d\u00edn Husen Khan's (n\u00e1zm from 1231 to 1234 fasli) term of office, a notable fight took place between R\u00e1e Bindeshuri Bakhsh of Dal\u00edppur and Diw\u00e1n Pirth\u00edp\u00e1l Singh of Urayy\u00e1dsh and J\u00e1mt\u00e1li, for the possession of some border land in Loh\u00e1r T\u00e1ra. The Dal\u00edppur taluqdar was killed, and his tomb is to be seen in Loh\u00e1r T\u00e1ra. Hence there is 'h\u00e1r' (grudge or feud) betwixt the present Dal\u00edppur taluqdar, R\u00e1e M\u00e1dho Parsh\u00e1d, nephew of Bindeshuri, and some of the Patti families,\n\n* Died in 1866.\nwho are closely connected with the Urayy\u0101d\u012bh taluqdar, and they neither eat nor drink, nor halt in each other's villages.\n\n\"Darshan Singh (n\u00e1zim).\u2014In 1235 fasli, R\u00e1ja Darshan Singh (a Sangalp\u00edpi Brahman of no high caste), invested the fort of Chauh\u00e1rja Bakhsh, taluqd\u00e1r of Dalippur (successor to the slain Bindeshuri). The taluqdar as usual escaped, and shortly afterwards reinstated himself in official favour. Darshan Singh was twice n\u00e1zim\u2014once from 1235 to 1241, and again in 1245-46 fasli.\n\n\"M\u00e1n Singh (n\u00e1zim).\u2014This man, who has achieved notoriety since, was n\u00e1s\u00edm from 1252 to 1254 fasli. His term of office was not remarkable. In 1255 fasli, W\u00e1j\u00edd Ali Khan, for some private grudge (people say concerning an elephant, which R\u00e1e Pirth\u00edpal Singh of D\u00e1\u00fadpur had refused to give him), allied himself with that taluqdar's two sons, Digbijai Singh and Randh\u00edr Singh (the latter had by adoption acquired an independent estate now known as the hissa half or 9-20ths of Patti Saifabad), and invested the fort of D\u00e1\u00fadpur. After eighteen days fighting, the taluqdar was obliged to evacuate the place, and escape into British territory. The son, Digbijai Singh, obtained the estate, but matters were accommodated in two months, and the father returned to power.\n\n\"The zamindars of Phenh\u00e1n and Horilpur.\u2014As an instance of taluqdars tenure and method, it may be worth while to recount how the zamindar of Phenh\u00e1n and Horilpur, which villages are and were in the Dalippur estate, took on himself to mortgage his lands to Debi Singh of M\u00e1dhopur. Sitla Bakhsh of Dalippur at once resented the liberty, and the bands were mustered on each side. They met in Phenh\u00e1n. The fight was determined by the capture of a M\u00e1dhopur cannon by Sitla Bakhsh's men, and the villages remained as they were. Another illustration of taluqdar\u00ed manners is the story of Randhir Singh (late husband of Th\u00e1kur\u00e1in Ajit Kunwar of 9-20th Patti taluqa, and son as aforesaid of R\u00e1e Pirth\u00edpal of R\u00e1epur) and Mangal Parsh\u00e1d. The former, bearing ancient hostility to the latter, seized him one day in Kishunganj in the Sultanpur district when off his guard, and tortured him to extort money. After a month of this work he let him go. Mangal Parsh\u00e1d applied to the n\u00e1zim, \u00c1gh\u00e1 Ali Khan, for redress, which Randh\u00edr Singh did not wait to see administered; but fled the country and remained under the guise of a merchant for many months travelling from place to place. At last spies tracked him to Kasota in Allahabad, where the magistrate of the district arrested him. He was made over to the n\u00e1zim who went to Allahabad to take him. He was very properly kept in painful confinement at Lucknow, and was released only when the British Government was established in Oudh.\"\n\nPlaces of note.\u2014I now propose to record a few notes in connection with the old fort of Bilkhar, the temple of Chauh\u00e1rja at Parasr\u00e1mpur, the villages of D\u00e1\u00fadpur, Patti, and Dalippur, which, are the only places of any archaeological interest in pargana Patti Dalippur:\n\n\"Kot Bilkhar.\u2014With regard to the old fort of Bilkhar, the q\u00e1n\u00fangeo gives the following account, which is currently believed in these parts. Many hundreds of years ago Ghaibar S\u00e1h, ancestor of R\u00e1ja R\u00e1mdeo Bil-\nkharia, came from headquarters with \u00c1s\u00e1j\u00edt, ancestor of the Patti q\u00e1n\u00fangos, armed with instructions to exterminate the Bhars, and provided with a title deed bestowing on him the zamindari of the entire pargana. Having successfully performed the former part of his mission, Ghaibar S\u00e1h took possession of the broad lands of the pargana, and, establishing himself in manza Bilkhar, built therein the famous fort known as 'Kot Bilkhar,' the ruins of which remain to this day. This fort may be said to have been the historical rallying point of the Bilkhar\u00edas. A Mah\u00e1deo or representation of the deity, which is still to be seen within the ruins, is, and has been from time immemorial, known as Bilkharn\u00e1th. A fair is annually held here on this account, which takes place on the 13th of the month of Ph\u00e1gun (February-March), and attracts about 2,500 people from the more immediate neighbourhood. If procurable, Ganges water is poured on the idol, otherwise water from the Sai; while offerings of flowers, fruit, and pice complete the ceremony. The fort of Bilkhar was successively occupied by the descendants of Ghaibar S\u00e1h down to R\u00e1ja R\u00e1mdeo Singh, with whose rule the supremacy of the Bilkhar\u00edas terminated. It is further asserted that some 600 years or, more ago, Bari\u00e1r Singh, ancestor of the Bachgotis, slew R\u00e1ja R\u00e1mdeo, and took possession of the fort, and his descendants to the time of Harbans R\u00e1e occupied it. When the paternal acres were divided between D\u00edngur and N\u00e1har Singh, the two sons of Harbans R\u00e1e, 'Kot Bilkhar' fell to the lot of the former, who is ancestor in a direct line of the present Taluqdar of Dal\u00edppur, R\u00e1e M\u00e1dho Parsh\u00e1d Singh. D\u00edngur Singh and his heirs continued to occupy the fort down to the year 1180 fasli (A.D., 1773), when the last owner, R\u00e1e Meherb\u00e1n Singh, came into collision with the n\u00e1zim, who razed the fort and left it in ruins. The spot is on the left bank of the Sai, some seven miles from the headquarters of the district. The ruins of the old fort may be seen on an elevated plateau surrounded on three sides by ravines and broken ground covered with scrub jungle, and on the fourth side by the river. The fosse is clearly distinguishable all round.\"\n\nThe temple of Chauh\u00e1rja.\u2014Concerning the temple of Chauh\u00e1rja, my predecessor has placed the following on record:\n\n\"In the village of Parasr\u00e1mpur, in the Dari\u00e1pur il\u00e1qa, is situated a noted fane of the goddess Debi, who is worshipped under the name of Chauh\u00e1rja. It is said to be of superlative antiquity, and, in proof of it, the priests assert that the hero \u00c1lha, whose praises and deeds form the subject of minstrels' songs to this day, and whose tomb is shown at Chun\u00e1r, worshipped Debi here, and made a well at this place, which is still visible. Indeed, \u00c1lha is said to have continued his visits to the shrine long after he disappeared from mortal life; and stories of his apparitions are told, but I need not relate them.\"\n\nTwo fairs take place here annually: one on the 8th Ku\u00e1r (September-October), and the other on the 9th Chait (March-April). On each occasion some 6,000 people, within a radius of about 20 miles or so, collect at the spot. In addition to the observances recorded above with reference to Bilkharn\u00e1th, extensive sacrificial offerings of goats and sucking pigs are made at this shrine of Chauh\u00e1rja.\nD\u00e1\u00fadpur.\u2014D\u00e1\u00fadpur\u2014in the R\u00e1epur Bichhaur taluqa, hissa 9-20th\u2014was formerly a place of some note. It is traditionally asserted that the founder of the town and fort, D\u00e1\u00fad Khan, was in the first instance a Bhar, but that alarmed for his safety at the Muhammadan invasion, he embraced the faith of Isl\u00e1m, and returned as an adherent with the conquering Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn Khilji to the Sult\u00e1n's court. He was then rewarded with a grant of twelve villages in this part of the country and dubbed a Kum\u00e9d\u00e1n within the Subah of Allahabad. His two brothers, Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Khan and Saif Khan, founded about the same time the two adjacent villages of Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm-pur and Sar\u00e1\u00e9 Saif. After a lapse of some time, the property of D\u00e1\u00fad Khan and his posterity passed into the hands of a family of Bisr\u00e1ha Chhat-tris* (an offshoot of the Bachgoti clan), and was by them held until 1182 fasli (A.D. 1795), when it became incorporated in the taluqa of Patti Saifabad. On partition of the latter estate in 1217 fasli (A.D. 1809), D\u00e1\u00fadpur went into the taluqa of Raipur Bichhaur. The two sieges, which have rendered the fort of D\u00e1\u00fadpur famous, have already been narrated in Mr. King's account of the pargana. It was only levelled in A.D. 1858, when orders were issued to destroy all native standing forts. D\u00e1\u00fadpur itself has now dwindled down into a small and insignificant village.\n\nThe Bachgoti clan deserves a more general notice; it numbers, including the R\u00e1jkum\u00e1rs, above 40,000 in Oudh besides many in Jaunpur; it extends over three districts\u2014Partabgarh, Sultanpur, and Fyzabad\u2014having started originally from Tappa Asl in Sultanpur, to which one of its early scions gave its name. It was exceptionally fortunate during the mutinies; none of its chiefs lost even a portion of their estates through persistence in rebellion, or concealment of cannon; none of their estates are of unwieldy size, the largest, that generally known as Nissa-igara, covering only 60,000 acres. Several of its leading men are of considerable intelligence and education.\n\nThe clan originally possessed a very perfect feudal organization; its r\u00e1ja of His\u00e1mpur turned Musalman, and since then its titular terminology has become confused. It has several r\u00e1jas, several diw\u00e1ns, several b\u00e1b\u00fas, and several r\u00e1sos. For a further history of the R\u00e1jkum\u00e1r branch, see pargana Aldemau.\n\nIt only remains to be added that the pargana is a fertile and well watered one. There are numerous jh\u00fals, and water is found at about 24 feet from the surface.\n\nPIH\u00c1NI\u2020\u2014Pargana PIH\u00c1NI PINDARWA\u2014Tahsil SHAHABAD\u2014District HARDOI.\u2014(Latitude 27\u00b038' north, longitude 80\u00b014' east.) A town of 7,582 inhabitants on the unmetalled road between Sitapur and Sh\u00e1hjahanpur; 3,088 of the residents are Muhammadans, and 4,494 are Hindus. They are lodged in 327 brick and 1,493 mud houses. Its public buildings are a police station and a Government school. Its chief interest lies in its association with Akbar's celebrated chancellor, Sadr Jah\u00e1n.\n\n* These Bisr\u00e1has were a degraded offshoot of the Hashgotis, owing, it is said, to a misalliance. The term is derived from \"B\u00eds\u00e1r,\" a Sanskrit word, signifying seed which has been borrowed in advance from a Mah\u00e1jan in contradiction to saved seed, and is used to denote impurity, or rather what is improper.\n\n\u2020 By Mr. A. H. Harington, C.S., Assistant Commissioner.\nTwo accounts are given of the founding of Pih\u00e1ni. The Hindus trace it to a settlement of Dub\u00e9 Brahmins invited from Kanauj by R\u00e1ja Lakhan Sen, the Gaur conqueror of the Thathera fort at Simaurgarh. The Muhammadan history, as collected by Mr. McMinn, is this:\n\n\"At the date of the battle of Bilgr\u00e1m (A.D. 1540), Abdul Ghaf\u00far, Sayyad, was q\u00e1zi of Kanauj. He had a younger brother, Abdul Muqtadi. After Hum\u00e1y\u00fan was expelled by Sher Sh\u00e1h, and took refuge with Shah Tuhm\u00e1sb of Persia, it is alleged that the latter called on Sher Sh\u00e1h to state why he usurped the throne which belonged properly to the Mughal. Sher Sh\u00e1h in return collected various statements from nobles of India, proving that Hum\u00e1y\u00fan was not a true believer. Abdul Ghaf\u00far was required to send a similar statement. He refused to do so, and to escape Sher Sh\u00e1h's vengeance, he left Kanauj, and concealed himself in the jungle on the opposite side of the Ganges where Pih\u00e1ni now stands.\n\n\"In 1555 Hum\u00e1y\u00fan returned, and Abdul Ghaf\u00far from his hiding place sent a letter of congratulation. Hum\u00e1y\u00fan gave him five villages rent-free in parganas Pasgawan and Pindarwa; also five thousand bighas of the jungle in which he had found shelter. This spot was therefore called Pih\u00e1ni; Pinh\u00e1ni meaning concealment, and a town founded in the forest-clearing.\n\n\"Ghaf\u00far \u00c1lam was the son of Abdul Muqtadi. He was sent to the Q\u00e1zi-ul-Quzz\u00e1t at Delhi as a pupil. He made great progress, and was brought before the Emperor Akbar, who made him tutor to Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr; and was so pleased with the latter's success in his studies, that he entitled his preceptor Naw\u00e1b Sadr Jah\u00e1n, and made him sadr or chief mufti of the empire. It is possible, however, that this promotion was due to Sadr Jah\u00e1n's conversion to the new religion of which Akbar was the high priest, and into which Sadr Jah\u00e1n led his two sons. The sadr was the fourth officer in the empire. He was the highest law officer. He was administrator general and inquisitor into religious opinion. Sadr Jah\u00e1n continued to serve under Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr\u2014a proof, if any was needed, that the latter emperor shared the free-thinking views of his father, or he would never have allowed the official guardianship of the purity of the faith to be held by a pervert...........Sadr Jah\u00e1n's tomb is at Pih\u00e1ni. It was completed in 1068 Hijri (A.D. 1657). His descendants held high office under the Mughal emperors. Like his masters, Akbar and Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr, he had married Hindu wives, by one of whom, a Brahmani, P\u00e1rbat\u00ed, he had Murtaza Khan and Irtiza Khan. Murtaza Khan was Faujdar of Gopamau, and Irtiza Khan held the more important charge of the Ran-tambhaur fort. Badr Jah\u00e1n, another son, held both Barw\u00e1r and Kheri in rent-free tenure.\"\n\nMr. Blochmann gives some further particulars about Sadr Jah\u00e1n and his descendants:\n\n\"M\u00edr\u00e1n Sadr Jah\u00e1n was born at Pih\u00e1ni, a village near Kanauj. Through the influence of Sheikh Abd-un-nabi he was made mufti. When Abdul-lah Kh\u00e1n Uzbak, King of Tur\u00e1n, wrote to Akbar regarding his apostacy...\"\nfrom Isl\u00e1m, M\u00edr\u00e1n Sadr and Hak\u00edm Hum\u00e1un were selected as ambassadors. The answer which they took to Abdullah contained a few Arabic verses which Abdullah could construe into a denial of the alleged apostacy\u2014\u2018Of God, people have said that he had a son; of the prophet, some have said that he was a sorcerer. Neither God nor the prophet has escaped the slander of men. Then how should I?\u2019 M\u00edr\u00e1n returned in the 34th year and was made Sadr. Up to the 40th year he had risen to the dignity of a commander of 700; but later he was made an amil, and got a mansab of 2,000. During the reign of Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr, who was very fond of him, he was promoted to a command of 4,000, and received Kanauj as tuy\u00e1l. As Sadr under Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr he is said to have given away more lands in five years than under Akbar in fifty. He died in 1020 at the age, it is believed, of 120 years. His faculties remained unimpaired to the last. There is no doubt that he temporized, and few people got more for it than he. He also composed poems, though in the end of his life, like Budaoni, he repented and gave up poetry, as against the spirit of the Muhammedan law. He had two sons:\n\n\u201c(1.) M\u00edr Badr-i-Alam. He lived a retired life. (2.) Sayyid Niz\u00e1m Murtaza Khan. His mother was a Brahman woman, of whom his father had been so enamoured that he married her; hence Niz\u00e1m was his favourite son. He was early introduced at court, and at the death of his father was made a commander of 2,500, 2,000 horse. In the first year of Shah Jah\u00e1n\u2019s reign he was promoted to a command of 3,000, and received on the death of Murtaza Kh\u00e1n Suji\u00e9 the title of Murtaza Khan. He served a long time in the Dakhin. His tuy\u00e1l was the pargana of Dalmau, where he on several occasions successfully quelled disturbances. He was also Faujdar of Lucknow. In the 24th year of Shah Jah\u00e1n\u2019s reign he was pensioned off, and received twenty lacs of dams per annum out of the revenue of Pih\u00e1ni, which was one kr\u00f3r. He enjoyed his pension for a long time. His sons died before him. On his death his grandsons, Abdul Muqtadi and Abdullah, were appointed to mansabs, and received as tuy\u00e1l the remaining portion of the revenue of Pih\u00e1ni. Abdul Muqtadi rose to a command of 1,000, 600 horse, and was Faujdar of Khairabad.\u201d (Translation of \u00c1\u00edn-i-Akbari, Vol. I., Farc\u00ed V., p. 468.)\n\nIn the Kheri history will be found a detailed account (by Mr. McMinn) of the steps by which, in the beginning of the eighteenth century, the Sombansi pervert r\u00e1ja, Ib\u00e1dulla Khan, possessed himself of the j\u00e1g\u00edr of these Pih\u00e1ni Sayyads.\n\nThe decay of Pih\u00e1ni is attributed to Ib\u00e1dulla Khan\u2019s encroachment, to the resumption of the j\u00e1g\u00edr by Sa\u00e1dat Ali Khan, and the loss of service since annexion.\n\nThe oldest portion of the town is called Bari Pih\u00e1ni; dirt and decay abound in it. Its chief ward or muhalla is M\u00edr-ki-Sar\u00e9. The oldest building in it is the tomb of Abdul Ghaf\u00far. The date stone has been removed from it. It stands close to the Khera or deserted site, which marks the residence of the early founders of chak Pih\u00e1ni, the Dubes from Kanauj, and the first Sayyad settlement during the reign of Akbar. The\nSayyad seem to have obliterated all traces of the earlier occupants. No ruined shrine is to be seen, only the remains of a huge masonry well. Bari Pih\u00e1ni was deserted when Niz\u00e1m Murtaza Khan founded the nearer adjacent town of Niz\u00e1mpur, or Chhoti Pih\u00e1ni. Chhoti Pih\u00e1ni presents an agreeable contrast to the older town. It is altogether clearer, brisker, more populous; viewed from the outside it seems to be buried in trees. The soil is good; the water near the surface. The western gateway, with its huge shafts of red sandstone, the bastions of the high enclosing wall, brick-faced, with blocks of kankar. The remains of Murtaza Khan's fort show many a scene of picturesque ruin. But the gem of the whole place is the grand old mosque and tomb of Sadr Jah\u00e1n and Badr Jah\u00e1n in Bari Pih\u00e1ni.\n\nIt is a building of much beauty. A double dome, poised on red sandstone pillars, rises from a pavement of brick, cased with carved slab of stone, and shaded by tamarinds of enormous girth. Lightness, symmetry, and grace, delicate colour, and rich but not florid ornamentation, are its characteristics.\n\nIn the nawabi, Pih\u00e1ni was the Damascus of Oudh, noted for the temper of its sword blades. But these and its woven turbans (dast\u00e1r) are things of the past.\n\n**PIH\u00c1NI PINDARWA Pargana\u2014Tahsil SHAHABAD\u2014District HARDOI.**\n\nThis pargana is bounded on the north by the district of Kheri, on the east by Kheri and Sitapur, on the west by pargana Alamnagar and Mansurnagar, and on the south by Gopamau and Mansurnagar. Its area is 45,544 acres, or 71 square miles, divided as follows:\n\n| Cultivated | ... | ... | 27,899 acres |\n|------------|-----|-----|--------------|\n| Irrigated  | ... | ... | 9,383 \"      |\n| Unirrigated| ... | ... | 18,066 \"     |\n| Culturable | ... | ... | 12,741 \"     |\n| Unculturable| ... | ... | 5,404 \"     |\n| **Total**  | ... | ... | **45,544\"** |\n\nThe soil is loam; the river Gumti passes through the pargana. There are four roads, viz.:\n\nFrom Pih\u00e1ni to Shahabad, from Pih\u00e1ni to Kulh\u00e1bar Gh\u00e1t, from Pih\u00e1ni to Hardoi, and from Pih\u00e1ni to Aurangabad.\n\nPih\u00e1ni and Pindarwa are the principal villages. The Government revenue is Rs. 40,861. The population amounts to 36,979, and the number of houses is 6,607. There are 12 schools within the pargana; the town of Pih\u00e1ni has post and registry offices, and a police station.\n\nFormerly Pih\u00e1ni was not a pargana, but was merely known by the name of \"J\u00e1g\u00edr of S\u00e1d\u00e1t.\" Since the Sayyads of Pih\u00e1ni lost their j\u00e1g\u00edrs, the land revenue of Pih\u00e1ni itself was collected along with that of pargana Pindarwa. In the time of Hak\u00edm Mehndi, Chakladar of Muhamdi (1819-1820), some of the villages of Pindarwa pargana were amalgamated\nwith Pih\u00e1ni; since then Pih\u00e1ni was selected as the headquarters of the ziladar, and consequently Pih\u00e1ni was converted into a pargana. Some 100 years ago a combat took place at village Zam\u00far between the Sayyads of Pih\u00e1ni and the Gaurs. The zamindars of Pih\u00e1ni are of various castes\u2014Rajputs, Brahmins, K\u00e1yaths, and Muhammadans.\n\n**PIRNAGAR Pargana*\u2014Tahsil SITAPUR\u2014District SITAPUR.**\u2014Pargana P\u00edrnagar is bounded on the north and north-east by pargana Bisw\u00e1n, on the north-west by pargana Khairabad, on the west by pargana Machh-rehta, on the east by pargana B\u00e1ri, and on the south by pargana Gundlamau. It is separated from Machhrehta and Gundlamau by the river Sar\u00e1yan and from Khairabad by the Gon, which flows into the Sar\u00e1yan at the town of P\u00edrnagar, the Sar\u00e1yan flowing into the Gumti at Hindaura Gh\u00e1t.\n\nThe Sar\u00e1yan is a very winding river, and the lands on either side of it are high and barren and cut up by ravines. The jungle here is considerable; there is a deal of us\u00e1r land; water is found, where found at all, at a great depth, 49 feet from the surface; wells cannot be dug at all in the neighbourhood of the ravines.\n\nBut in the centre of the district the character of the soil is quite different; there wells are dug with ease. The productive powers of the soil are good; the land is level. There are no hills or forests.\n\nThe pargana is a small one being only 44 square miles in extent, of which 28 are cultivated. The detail is as follows:\n\n| Acres | Cultivated | Culturable |\n|-------|------------|------------|\n|       | 17,770     |            |\n| ,,    | 4,296      |            |\n| ,,    | 21,994     |            |\n| ,,    | 15         | Rout-free  |\n| ,,    | 5,947      | Barren     |\n| ,,    | 5,962      |            |\n| Total | 27,956     |            |\n\nThe population numbers 15,295, and is distributed thus:\n\n| Hindus agricultural | Musalmans agricultural | Non-agricultural |\n|---------------------|------------------------|-----------------|\n| 8,841               | 370                    | 705             |\n| Non-agricultural    |                        |                 |\n| 5,379               |                        |                 |\n| Total               |                        | 1,075           |\n\nThese live in 2,935 houses, each of which thus is occupied by 5\u00b72 individuals. The Musalmans are 7 per cent. of the whole population; and to each head of the entire agricultural population there are 1\u00b79 acres of cultivated land, and 2\u00b74 of m\u00e1lguz\u00e1ri.\n\nThis proportion agrees with what obtains in parganas Khairabad and Sitapur. The incidence of the revised jama is as follows:\n\n| On cultivated area | 1 3 8 per acre. |\n|--------------------|-----------------|\n| On m\u00e1lguz\u00e1ri      | 0 15 4 \"        |\n| On total area      | 0 12 1 \"        |\n\n* By Mr. M. L. Ferrar, B.A., C.S., Assistant Commissioner.\nThe principal castes of the Hindus are\u2014Brahmans 2,374, Rajputs 1,139, Ahirs 1,422, Pasis 2,034, Chamars 2,394.\n\nThe pargana contains 54 demarcated villages, which are thus distributed,\u201415 taluqdari, 39 zemindari, Bais Chhattris own 48, Brahmins 3, Kaysaths own 2, Musalmans own 1; these Musalmans being descendants of a converted Rajput, a Purana or ancient Bais, to distinguish the caste from the modern Tilokchandi Bais, who now possess the greater part of the pargana.\n\nThese villages are all small, none of them having a population exceeding 1,000. Pirnagar itself boasts of but 790. There is not a single masonry house in the pargana, the people having a superstition against using burnt bricks or tiles for their residences. This superstition is not peculiar to Pirnagar, but exists in many other parts of the district (vide Towns Seota and Tambaur).\n\nThe fairs are six in number as follows:\n\n| Name of fair | Village          | Date   | Average attendance |\n|--------------|------------------|--------|--------------------|\n| Bansibat     | Jairampur        | Aghan  | 12,000             |\n| Hatila Pir ka| Bhainpur         | Jeth   | 500                |\n| Mahothe Rani | Mahothepur near Saidapur | Chait | 3,000              |\n| Husenia Dih  | Muhammedpur alias Mahothepur | Jeth | 5,000              |\n| Katki        | Phulpur          | Kartik | 1,000              |\n| Dhanuk Jagg  | Bhitauli         | Aghan  | 3,000              |\n\nand at these a good trade is carried on by the dealers in the ordinary necessaries of life.\n\nThe Jairampur fair was founded by Bansibat, a follower of the great Ram Chandar, in honour of whose espousals with Sita the mela is held.\n\nThe fair called Hatila Pir-ka-mela is a Musalman festival, and commemorates the death of Hatila Pir, a martyr to Islam, who fell fighting for his faith, in the ranks of his maternal uncle, Masaud of Ghazni, the Sayyad Salar, who invaded Oudh, and whose tomb is at Bahraich.\n\nThe Mahothepur fair is a local Bais festival, held in honour of Queen Mahothe, an ancient princess of that clan, whose life was pure and noble, and who on her consort's death became a sati.\n\nThe Bhitauli feast is to commemorate the breaking of the bow (dhanuk) by Rama before his marriage with Sita.\n\nHusenia Dih is an unimportant local gathering requiring no particular notice.\n\nBesides the metalled road between Lucknow and Sitapur which divides the pargana, there are no other roads in it, and the only water communi-\ncation is afforded by the Sar\u00e1yan, which bears country boats down to the Gumti at Hindaura Gh\u00e1t, and thence to Lucknow.\n\nThe only sar\u00e1e in the whole pargana is at Kam\u00e1lpur. There are five shiw\u00e1las or Hindu temples, the most famous being that in honour of D\u00e1\u00fadh N\u00e1th in P\u00edrnagar. This town also possesses a mosque built by a Hindu, R\u00e1e Gans\u00far D\u00e1s; masonry tanks are unknown throughout the pargana, and the masonry wells, which are only 15 in number, are not used for irrigation, but for domestic purposes. The absence of all which things is to be accounted for by the impecuniosity of the zamindars.\n\nThe only public (Government) structures in the pargana are the metalled road and caravan-serai already mentioned, a masonry bridge at P\u00edrnagar over the Sar\u00e1yan, and an Engineer's bungalow on the high road at D\u00e1\u00fadh-pur, close to P\u00edrnagar.\n\nThe pargana is not at all historically famous; no great heroes lived here; no great battles were fought; no Hindu hero or Delhi B\u00e1dsh\u00e1h or Lucknow Nawab ever tarried in it for the pleasures of the chase, or in exile, as has happened in some of the other parganas. In fact, its history may be given in a few words, and runs thus:\n\nIn the beginning, the country, now known as the pargana, was held by Bais Chhattris, not by Tilokchandi Bais, whose origin dates from only 400 years back, but by ancient Bais, and was part of their dominions, which went under the name of Chap\u00e1ngarh. They gradually became extinct, and were succeeded by Kacheras and Gujars, and J\u00fats also, according to the q\u00e1n\u00fangos, who held sway under king Akbar's time, or 300 years ago, when Bhikhandeo, a Tilokchandi Bais, and Th\u00e1n Singh, were granted the lands by that monarch, as a reward for having saved the life of the R\u00e1ni of Baundi (in Bahraich), who on her way to bathe in the sacred water of Pr\u00e1g (the modern Allahabad) had been seized by certain Moslem ravishers. So Tilok Chand Bais got the lands, which had just then been formed into a pargana by Todar Mal, and their descendants hold the greater part or nine-tenths of it to the present day; one village only out of the 54 is held by a descendant of the ancient Bais, and he is a Musalman, as already mentioned.\n\nThe pargana was known at first as Bahrimau, which name it retained until Jah\u00e1ngir's reign, when it was changed to P\u00edrnagar, from the name of the town. The founder of this latter was R\u00e1e Gans\u00far D\u00e1s, the Diw\u00e1n of P\u00edr Muhammad, then Subahdar of Oudh, and he named it after his master, and built the mosque abovementioned to calm the indignation which the subahdar felt on being informed that in the town founded in his honour a Hindu temple had been erected.\n\nThe place is not mentioned in any of the older epics or histories of India, and the only remains of antiquity to be met with are 9 of those nameless barrows, called by the country folk d\u00edhs. These are mounds of earth varying in area from 20 to 50 acres, and raised from the surface of the ground by from 20 to 100 feet. They are covered with the remains\nof broken tiles and bricks, and are apparently the sites of old towns or strongholds, built before the memory of man. The villages can tell nothing of their origin. At Unasia (see pargana Khairabad), at Manwan (vide town history), at R\u00e1mkot, at Harg\u00e1m, &c., the dih is connected with the name of some mythical or historical character. They are met with all over the province of Oudh, and they bear evidence that the people who erected them had advanced to a higher degree of civilization than the present inhabitants of the country. It is strange that up to the present time nothing in the way of inscriptions has been discovered in any of these dihas. They were probably, as stated above, strongholds; they were certainly not tombs, so that perhaps they should not have been called above nameless barrows.\n\nPIT\u00c1RI\u2014Pargana Sikandarpur\u2014Tahsil Unao\u2014District Unao.\u2014A village about four miles north-west of the sadr station. No river flows near it, or road passes through it. It is an old village dating from the time of R\u00e1ja Unwant Singh, the reputed founder of Unao. Kunwar Singh, the grandfather of Gajr\u00e1j Singh, the present lambardar, was a man of local celebrity. The people are mostly Hindus. The average annual sales at bazar amount to Rs. 3,000. The population is 3,589, as follows:\n\n| Brahmins | ... | ... | ... | ... | 223 |\n| Chhattiri | ... | ... | ... | ... | 388 |\n| Musalmans | ... | ... | ... | ... | 179 |\n| P\u00e1si | ... | ... | ... | ... | 139 |\n| Ahir | ... | ... | ... | ... | 300 |\n| Others | ... | ... | ... | ... | 2,665 |\n| **Total** | ... | ... | ... | ... | **3,589** |\n\nPUKHRA\u2014Pargana Haidargarh\u2014Tahsil Haidargarh\u2014District Bara Banki.\u2014This village is situated on the Rae Bareli and Haidargarh road, five miles east of the Gumti. The country around is fairly wooded and fertile. The population is 3,383, of whom 1,005 are Brahmans. There is a very fine temple in honour of Mah\u00e1deo, and a tank, with masonry bathing gh\u00e1ts, erected by Beni Dube, late Suba in a native state, at a cost of Rs. 89,000. This temple is much larger than the ordinary ones. There is also a Th\u00e1kurdw\u00e1ra, but nothing else of note in the town.\n\nThis place is the headquarters of the estate of Pukhra Ans\u00e1ri of the chief Amethia Chhattiris, one of which clan R\u00e1ja Sahaj\u00edram Bakhsh was a notorious insurgent in the naw\u00e1bi.\n\nPURWA Pargana\u2014Tahsil Purwa\u2014District Unao.\u2014This pargana is bounded on the north by Gorinda Parsandan, on the east by Maur\u00e1nw\u00e1n, on the south by Panhan, P\u00e1tan, and Magr\u00e1yar, and on the west by Harha. Its area is 111 square miles or 71,032 acres, comprising 123 villages. It is twelve miles long by ten broad. The soil is chiefly loam and clay, and the principal crops are wheat, b\u00e1jra, and sugarcane. The Lon river winds its way through a portion of the lands of this pargana during the rainy and cold seasons, but dries up in the hot weather. Water is found at from 52 in the south to 15 feet in the east. There are six baz\u00e1rs.\nThe Government revenue is Rs. 84,367, and the assessment falls at Re. 1-3-0 per acre. The tenure is as follows:\n\n| Taluqdari | Zamindari | Pattidari |\n|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n|           |           |           |\n|           |           |           |\n\nThe population amounts to 64,758. There is an old temple in Purwa to Billeswar Mah\u00e1deo.\n\nThe pargana was formed in Akbar's time; for a history of the name see town article. This was the most westerly portion of the Bais dominions. It was ruled by Achal Singh, thus referred to by Elliot:\n\n\"There is nothing to notice in the history of the family till we come to Oogursen. His younger son, Dhara, was in the service of R\u00e1ja Achul Singh of Poorwah, and was the chief of his armed retainers. His valour is conspicuously mentioned in the ballad which details the fight between Achul and Dewanbux, who headed the houses of the combined families of Symbusse and Nyhesta. In that fight a pair of kettle-drums were taken from Dewanbux and were kept by the head of Achul's family at Doonea Khera. The disgrace was keenly felt by the other party, and quite lately Rana Rughonath Singh sent to Rao Rambux to offer terms on which he might get the drums back, a message to which the Rae politely answered that he would be most happy if Rughonath could recover them in the same way in which Achul Singh had taken them. Oogursen stood security for a friend who defaulted, and he was unable to pay up the default. Achul Singh, unmindful of the services of his son, seized and bound him, and had one of his sons, named Dheer Singh, murdered before his eyes. Next morning Oogurseu was found dead at the bottom of a well, and it was darkly whispered that it was not grief or despair which brought him to that end. Dhara at once threw up the raja's service, and took to plundering his estates, and lived the life of an outlaw. In order to keep him in check, the tahsil and fort were removed from Asoha to Kantha, and the forces allotted to the pargana were stationed in that town. In 1184 fesli Achul Singh was succeeded in the Nizamut by Bhowani Singh, and soon after took poison and died, on which Dhara Singh came back to his home, and became a peaceable subject again.\" (pp. 48-49, \"Elliot's Chronicles of Oonao.\")\n\nPURWA\u2014Pargana PURWA\u2014Tahsil PURWA\u2014District UNAO.\u2014The town of Purwa lies in latitude 26\u00b032' north, longitude 80\u00b052' east, and is situated twenty miles south-east of Unao. There is a lake called Basha close to this town on the north. Four unmetalled roads lead to it\u2014one from Unao to Rae Bareli, another from Purwa to Cawnpore, a third from Purwa to Lucknow, and a fourth from Purwa to Bilh\u00e1r, Baksar, and Rae Bareli. The town is locally noted for good shoe-makers. Two baz\u00e1srs are held weekly, attended by about 1,000 visitors. There are three large fairs here during the year. Two are held in honour of Sri Billeswar Mah\u00e1deo, about one mile east of the town, one on the day of Shiur\u00e1ttri, and the other on the 1st and 2nd days of Aghan, about November; each of these fairs is\nattended by about seven or eight thousand people. The annual amount of sales at these fairs and the bazars is about Rs. 31,000. The population amounts to 10,880, the Hindus number 8,355, and Moslems 2,525, of the Hindus, Brahmins (2,267), Bani\u00e1ns (2,000), and K\u00e1yaths (1,000) predominate. There is a tahsil, a th\u00e1na, and a school where more than a hundred boys are taught. Purwa was formerly the headquarters of the chakladar of the Harha Purwa, chakla or collectorate of the nawabi. At annexation also the headquarters of the district were at Purwa. A t\u00e1sildar only resides there now.\n\nThe town is said to have been founded about 500 years ago. Primarily one R\u00e1ja Newan, a Raghubansi resident of Ajodhya, came and settled at a place four miles west of this town, which is now known as New\u00e1yan. After some time the river Lon washed that village away. R\u00e1ja Ranb\u00edr Singh, a descendant of the abovenamed raja, who ruled New\u00e1yan at that time laid the foundation of this town, which stands on the land of the villages Bhaw\u00e1n\u00edpur, Sokipur, and Kal\u00ed\u00e1npur. It was then called Ranb\u00edrpur. Now the word \"Ranjit\" is put (erroneously) instead of Ranb\u00edr, and the town is called \"Ranjitpurwa\" or \"Purwa.\"\n\nR\u00e1ja Achal Singh Bais, a resident and taluqdar of Daundia Khera, was chakladar, as also the liege lord of the town of Purwa, and had taken up his residence at this place from 1123 fa\u0161li (A.D. 1716) to 1183 fa\u0161li (A.D. 1776). The other Th\u00e1kurs of Baisw\u00e1ra and of the Bais tribe, who had a great dislike to the rule of the chakladar, waged war against Achal Singh, in which they were totally defeated. R\u00e1ja Achal Singh then had a garden laid out on the very plain where the battle was fought which is still there. R\u00e1ja Achal Singh, R\u00e1ja S\u00edtal Parsh\u00e1d, Tirbedi, Nazim, and Fateh Ali, a favourite slave of Alm\u00e1s Ali, Khw\u00e1ja Sar\u00e1, have been remarkable persons in the history of this town. R\u00e1ja Achal Singh is said to have been the founder of Achalganj in the pargana Harha, district Unao, Achal Khera, &c., in pargana and tahsil Purwa, as also of the following villages in this district,\u2014Purwa, \u00danchg\u00e1on, Naig\u00e1on, Banthar, Jhalotor.\n\nR\u00e1ja S\u00edtal Parsh\u00e1d founded S\u00edtalganj in this place, embellishing it with a temple and a tank. Another place of this name was founded by the same n\u00e1zim in Ras\u00falabad.\n\nFateh Ali was the founder of Fatehganj which lies near Purwa, and he planted the road from Purwa to Bash\u00e1, and from Jal\u00e1labad to the entrance gate of the city of Lucknow, with trees for the convenience and comfort of travellers. He also had laid out and planted a garden, with a masonry tank, in the city of Lucknow. Buildings of former times now remaining are the temple of Billeswar Mah\u00e1deo and the tomb of one M\u00edna S\u00e1hib\u2014both regarded as sacred by Hindus and Muhammadans respectively; a shrine of Ni\u00e1m\u00e1t Shah, and a burial-place of one Hira Shah, both famous hermits, are also worthy of note here.\n\nQUTUBNAGAR*\u2014Pargana MISRIKH\u2014Tahsil MISRIKH\u2014District SITAPUR.\u2014Is 18 miles west from Sitapur on the high road to Hardoi.\n\n* By Mr. M. L. Ferrar, C.S., Assistant Commissioner.\nThree miles to the south-west runs the Gumti, which is navigable at all times of the year, and within two miles to the north-west runs a small stream called the Kathna which is not navigable.\n\nThe population numbers 2,256 of all castes; at the school attend 70 boys; the bazar is held on Tuesdays and Fridays; but the sales are inconsiderable, not exceeding Rs. 5,000 in the year. The climate is good. The only masonry house in the place is the residence of the taluqdar, and is built on some rising ground, the site of an old d\u012bh called \u201cKunj Bih\u0101ri-pur,\u201d which had been owned by a community of faq\u012brs. Within the enclosure is an ancient Hindu well called \u201cBiswa Mitra,\u201d and the remains of what once is said to have been a masonry tank called \u201cJamb\u016b D\u012bp.\u201d There are 421 mud-built houses.\n\nHard by in Deog\u0101on is a mud tank, which is visited in ph\u0101gun by the Nimkh\u0101r pilgrims when going on their \u201cpaikarma.\u201d\n\nThe taluqdar of Qutubnagar belongs to the same family as the taluqdar of Aurangabad, both being descended from that Bah\u0101dur Beg who 200 years ago, in the reign of \u0100lamg\u012br, got a j\u0101g\u012br of this part of the country.\n\nAnother account has it that it was in Shah Jah\u0101n\u2019s reign the present taluqdar\u2019s ancestor, Mirza Muhammad At\u0101, acquired the property.\n\nThere are no manufactures of any sort in Qutubnagar, and the place is altogether devoid of any interest, historical or otherwise.\n\nRAE BARELI DIVISION.\u2014R\u0113c Bareli is a division of British territory in Oudh comprising three districts, whose names, areas, and population are given in the accompanying table:\n\n| Division | Number of villages | Total | Cultivated | Hindu | Musliman | European | Eurasian | Males | Females | Total | Average to square mile |\n|----------|--------------------|-------|------------|-------|----------|----------|---------|-------|---------|-------|----------------------|\n| Rae Bareli | 1,768 | 1,747 | 857 | 909,930 | 68,706 | 47 | 38 | 498,320 | 495,688 | 999,008 | 146 |\n| Sultanpur | 2,526 | 1,706 | 890 | 911,441 | 84,495 | 43 | 40 | 506,644 | 490,932 | 996,576 | 584 |\n| Partabgarh | 2,200 | 1,445 | 696 | 719,329 | 63,183 | 18 | 23 | 398,576 | 384,108 | 782,681 | 542 |\n| Total | 6,494 | 4,898 | 2,443 | 2,540,700 | 216,384 | 108 | 98 | 1,397,840 | 1,370,728 | 2,768,568 | 568 |\n\n* The areas in the above statement are obtained from settlement returns.

At present it lies between 25\u00b049' and 26\u00b035' north latitude, and 80\u00b045' and 81\u00b040' east longitude. Its area is 1,739* square miles, and its population 989,008\u2020. It now consists of four tahsils\u2014Rae Bareli, Digbijalganj, Laalganj, and Salon. These are subdivided into the following parganas:\n\n| Rae Bareli. | Inhauna. |\n|-------------|---------|\n| Dalmau.     | Simranata. |\n| Sareni.     | Mohanganj. |\n| Khiron.     | Kumhrawan. |\n| Salon.      | Bachhrawan. |\n| Parshadepur.| Hardoi. |\n| Bokha Jais. |         |\n\nBoundaries.\u2014The present district has no natural boundaries except the Ganges to the south-west and south; on the east it is bounded by tahsil Bih\u00e1r (Kunda) of Partabgarh, on the north-east by Bara Banki, on the north-west by Lucknow district, and on the west by Unao. The general shape of the country is a rough truncated ovoid, with its base to the south-west on the Ganges, and its extremity reaching to within seven miles of the Gumti. This segment of the Gangetic plain is divided into two nearly equal portions by the river Sai. It is flat, with no mountains; its elevation varies from about 395 feet above the sea on the north-west to 285 the level of the Ganges when it leaves the district. The slope is good therefore; it is from north-west to south-east; and all the rivers take that course. Particular points are recorded in the revenue survey map as attaining a higher elevation, but these are on artificial elevations selected or erected by the surveyors themselves. Such are the present territorial limits of the Rae Bareli district.\n\n* By Settlement Returns, 1,747 square miles.\n\u2020 This is the total of the pargana population as given in the census report, and it differs somewhat from later calculations which make the population of the district 988,719.\nChange of territory.\u2014But the administrative arrangement has only been arrived at after several steps. There were at first four tahsils\u2014Bih\u00e1r, Dalmau, Bareli, and Haidargarh. These were reduced to three\u2014Bih\u00e1r, Bareli, and Haidargarh. Then the Bih\u00e1r tahsil containing seven parganas\u2014Daundia Khera, Gh\u00e1tampur, Bhagwantnagar, Bih\u00e1r, Panhan, P\u00e1tan, and Magr\u00e1yar\u2014was transferred to the Unao district; Haidargarh at the extreme north was placed in Bara Banki; while Simrauta, Mohanganj, Inhauna, Rokha Jais have been transferred to Rae Bareli from Sultanpur; Salon and Parsh\u00e1depur from Partabgarh.\n\nThe area, population, and administrative divisions of the district are given in Chapter III. Those of the old district were as follows:\u2014Area 1,350 square miles, number of villages 1,482, population 782,874.\n\nRae Bareli has been more changed by the re-distribution of 1869 than any other district. In fact, it received so to speak a fresh tahsil to the south-east: its parganas were transferred to Unao and Bara Banki; and it was compensated by additions from Partabgarh and Sultanpur to the east. Still the map of the old district remains incorporated, and forms the chief portion of the new. The former is thus described by the settlement officer. It must be remembered that the north-east extremity towards the Gumti, the shank of the shoulder of mutton afterwards mentioned, has been cut off and transferred to Bara Banki.\n\nSuperficial configuration.\u2014The district of Rae Bareli may be said to resemble in shape a shoulder of mutton, with the shank broken and bent backwards. The shank forms the tahsil of Haidargarh; the remainder forms the three tahsils, which last year from motives of economy were doubled up into two.\n\nThe river Ganges forms the south-west boundary of the district. On the north-east, at the extremity of the Haidargarh tahsil, the Gumti is the boundary. Between them the Sai runs through the very centre of the district, and between the Sai and the Ganges, the Loni n\u00e1la coming out of the Unao district, and running generally parallel to the course of the rivers, falls into the Ganges near Dalmau. About midway between the rivers is a kind of elevated hollow in which there is a string of jhils which on the map follow the course of the rivers, and are a striking feature of the country. From these jhils lateral n\u00e1las lead into the rivers, and carry off the superfluous water. This conformation is to be found between the Gumti and the Sai, the Sai and the Loni, and the Sai and the Ganges, after the confluence of the Loni with the Ganges, while it also is to be found in a limited degree between the Loni and the Ganges. But the high bank of the Ganges and the Loni approach so near to each other at the western extremity of the district, that the space left for the jhils is very small, and they become almost nothing.\n\nThe effect of this is to make the country topographically lie in belts or zones. Beginning with the Ganges, we have the villages on the high bank of the river much broken and sandy, with the water a good distance from the surface. Those villages are generally among the poorest in the\ndistrict. Within this belt lies a strip of villages, which, taken all in all, are perhaps the finest in the district, as they are wholly cultivated, and are irrigated nearly altogether from wells, though they get assistance from small ponds. Within these again come the villages among the large jhils, showing many of them the finest land of all, but intermixed with large waste tracts, of which it is sometimes very hard to say whether they are barren or culturable. These villages are irrigated mainly from the jhils, whence the water is thrown up upon the fields by manual labour. Proceeding still in a north-easterly direction, we come again to the belt of five villages irrigated from wells, and further on to the sandy, poorer, and broken villages on the banks of the Sai, where irrigation is less resorted to. The like description will suffice for the surface of the country, still pursuing a north-east line, up to the Gumti.\n\nGeneral aspect.\u2014The general aspect of the district is undulating in a slight degree, which, as the country is beautifully wooded, chiefly with mango and mahua groves, gives it a variety which is not often to be observed in the valley of the Ganges. The fertility of the soil is remarkable, and the cultivation being of a high class, the beauty of the country is not to be surpassed by any part of the real plain of Hindustan. Scattered here and there, all over the district and more specially towards the Ganges, are noble trees, generally bargad or pipal. Trees are not however grown for timber. The babul is not plentiful, and the bamboo is very scarce, while the shisham and the tun, both of which thrive well, and would be a certain revenue from the lands which are too broken for cultivation, are not to be found in the district, save where planted as ornamental trees since our occupation of the country.\n\nThe general appearance of the Rae Bareli district conveys the impression of its being a highly favoured and richly productive tract of country, and as a rule the crops, where there has been careful cultivation, are heavy and probably up to the average of production in the province, but the absence in any quantity of the heavy black, loamy, bog-like soil, found in large quantities in the south-eastern portion of Oudh, is a remarkable feature of this district. Not that this want affects the general fertility of the country, and the reason is obvious, the agricultural implements in local use are few in number; light, quickly worn out, and easily broken, the lighter therefore the material to be worked upon, the less is the expenditure; nor are the returns less in light than on heavy soils, the successful cultivation of which requires the possession of capital. The chief growth on the heavy clay soils of the south-eastern part of Oudh is of rice which is first sown thickly in small beds, and after it has attained a height of about a foot, the tops of the plants are cut off, and they are planted out in fields which are surrounded by mud walls to retain the water, with which they are flooded soon after the rains commence till long after they have ceased, but efforts are seldom made to cultivate these lands for the spring crops; because the clay on them, after a short exposure to even a November sun, becomes as hard as a rock and as dry as a bone, and it is only when thoroughly saturated with water, as during the rainy season, that they,\ncan be even roughly worked. The chief advantages of clays over light soils are that they require but little manure, as they contain large quantities of the substances required by plants, and that they retain these substances which in lighter soils would be washed down by heavy rain into the substratum; and the disadvantages of light soils are that water washes out the valuable portions of manures before the roots of plants have had time to take them up, and that consequently they have to be frequently manured.\n\nIn a country blessed, as this portion of British India is for the greater part of the year, with the nearly vertical rays of an almost tropical sun, and still raised sufficiently above the water level to escape remaining a perpetual swamp, the advantages above described as appertaining to clay soils are nullified, whilst their disadvantages are intensified. No amount of clay in a soil will do away with the necessity for irrigation, except during the rainy season, when the more valuable kinds of crops cannot be grown, and when the lightest description of soil becomes fertile, owing to the water level over the whole country remaining for some months high; on the other hand, light soils are adapted to the means at the disposal of and the mode of agriculture familiar to the people.\n\nThe rivers.\u2014The principal rivers are the Ganges and the Sai. The Ganges skirts the district for 54 miles separating it from Fatehpur; the Sai runs through it for 55 miles. The former is everywhere navigable for boats of 1,200 maunds or 40 tons; the latter is navigated during the rains only; it is about two feet deep in the dry weather, and might be used by barges. The banks of both are high and generally precipitous, and the level of the water is seventy or eighty feet below the surface of the country. They are not therefore of much value for irrigation except for the alluvial bottoms in the immediate neighbourhood. The bottoms are sandy. There are no large towns on their banks, and no centres of trade or commerce. Very little fishing is carried on except in the jhils. These rivers both flow from the north-west to south-east as do the smaller streams afterwards mentioned. The Sai is spanned by a fine bridge at Rae Bareli, erected since annexation in 1864 by the taluqdar; the ferries are so numerous and so changeable that it is not worth while to detail them here. The extreme flood discharge of the Sai is about 6,000 cubic feet per second; the average discharge during the five rainy months is about 1,000 cubic feet per second; the minimum discharge in the dry weather is about 25 feet per second. The Loni stream issues from a marsh known as the Moti jhil in the Unao district entering this district at a village named Utwal, pargana Magr\u0101yar, and leaving it at village Khaj\u016brg\u0101on, pargana Dalmau, where it falls into the Ganges. It runs a course of about thirty miles in this district, and dries up in the hot weather.\n\nThe Gurdhoi.\u2014The Gurdhoi is a water-course dry in the hot weather, and fed from the Ganges during the rains.\n\nThe Basha.\u2014The Basha is also a water-course dry during the hot weather, but a rather formidable stream during heavy rains. It enters this\ndistrict from Unao and after traversing the Khiron, and a portion of the Bareli parganas, it falls into the Sai river, a few miles west of Rae Bareli. It is apparently to the discharge of water from this stream that the heavy floods in the river Sai about and below Bareli are attributable.\n\n**Mung Tal.**\u2014Is a shallow lake occupying the greater portion of a village in pargana Simrauta about 1,500 acres in extent, to which it gives its name. Its margin only is usually cultivated, but when its contents are not exhausted by irrigation (for which purpose it is extensively used by the villages in its proximity), it bears a crop of summer rice. The piscary is valuable. It is famous also for its wild fowl; and this was the consideration, perhaps, which induced Nasir-ud-din Haidar to build a house upon its banks, but scandal, with its busy tongue, asserts that some fair Rosamond was the game of which he came in quest. The village long since ceased to be a royal residence, and nothing but the ruins of Nasir-ud-din's house now exist to show that it formerly enjoyed that honour.\n\n**The Naiya.**\u2014The Naiya is also a water-course dry during the hot weather. It enters this from the Lucknow district, and flows in three channels during the rains; two streams running into the Sultanpur district, and one finding its way into the river Sai near village Undobar.\n\n**The Sur.**\u2014A water-course dry during the hot weather, named the Sur, brings the surplus waters of a tank in the Unao district into the river Sai at a village named Bardar during the rains.\n\n**Drainage and irrigation.**\u2014Besides the above there are a great number of marshes and water-courses, which are all dry during the hot weather, and which all contribute towards causing floods during heavy rainy seasons. It is more than probable that by utilizing the natural advantages presented by these escapes and reservoirs, agreeably to some sensible and comprehensive system of drainage, heavy floods might be avoided throughout the district at a small expense, and that in deficient rainy seasons the water now wasted might be economically stored. As it is, the people never have one-tenth of the water they could utilize in the dry weather, and in occasional rainy seasons like the one just past (1871 A.D.) they are homeless and houseless wanderers owing to heavy floods. Here and there occasionally a dam is to be seen across some very small stream, and once or twice since annexation a dam has been made across the river Sai by private enterprise, but any combined or general efforts in this direction cannot be expected from the people.\n\nThe following notes on the natural products of the district are taken from Major Ouseley's settlement report:\n\n**Indigenous products of the district.**\u2014Tun (Cedrela toona),* a magnificent tree, with beautiful foliage, and a rather fine-grained wood, which takes a very good polish. The furniture made of it is much esteemed. The flowers are used for dyeing a yellow colour which the natives say is fast.\n\n* The botanical names have been taken from Shakespear's Hindustani dictionary.\nShisham (Dalbergia sissoo), a magnificent tree, with beautiful foliage, and a very fine-grained wood, which takes a very good dark polish. It is rather heavy for furniture, but is used extensively in gun and other carriage manufacture.\n\nDh\u00e1k (Butea frondosa), a tree much used for firewood, and with the roots the natives make rope.\n\nBabul (Acacia arabica), a tree of fast growth, with graceful foliage, and a very hard wood, universally used in the manufacture of country carts, agricultural implements, tent pegs, and mallets.\n\nGrazing grasses.\u2014The most esteemed species being \"dub\" (Agrostis linearis). It does not burn up so fast as other kinds in the hot weather.\n\nTin (Andropogon muricatum), a grass in universal use for thatching purposes, the reeds being made into brooms. The roots of it supply the 'khas,' with which our hot weather tatties are made. It grows on the banks of rivers and marshes, and is generally strictly preserved, as it takes time to spread. Proprietors are averse to its being dug up for the khas.\n\nPat\u00e1war or sarpat.\u2014(Saccharum munja, saccharum procerum, saccharum sara.) With the upper part of the stem are made \"sirki,\" a kind of mat which keeps off rain. The upper leaves are used for thatching. With the coarser leaves below these a string called \"munj\" is made, and the natives use the stalks or strong reeds which they call \"sentha\" for the groundwork of their thatches.\n\nK\u00e1ea (Saccharum spontaneum) is used for thatching and making a kind of string called \"b\u00e1n.\"\n\nKus.\u2014A kind of grass used for thatching, and of which blacksmiths make charcoal for their forges.\n\nPas\u00e1hi.\u2014A kind of rice which grows in many tanks and marshes.\n\nL\u00e1kh.\u2014The product* of an insect \"coccus lacca,\" which is found on the branches of different trees. From it is produced, after it has been steeped in water to carry off the colouring matter, the \"chapra,\" or shell lac of commerce, the manufacture of which is carried on at Cawnpore, where the colouring matter is made into cakes of a deep red colour. The raw produce is sold to P\u00e1s\u00eds, Khat\u00edks, and other low caste tribes, who break off the twigs on which it is deposited in the months of May and June.\n\nIn this state it is known as \"stick lac.\" After separating the deposit from the twigs, when it is known as seed lac, they sell it to Manih\u00e1rs, who make it into \"ch\u00faris\" or bangles.\n\nSilkworm.\u2014Kuswari. The cocoon of a silkworm, \"Phal\u00e9na paphia,\" which spins on the b\u00e9ri, a kind of yellow plum tree. The thread is like\n\n---\n\n* Drury's Useful Plants of India, Page 5.\nvery fine tasar silk. The cocoon when cut spirally into a thin long strip was used during the native rule by matchlock-men to fasten the barrel to the stock of their matchlocks, and was esteemed by them better for that purpose than iron. The thread is used sometimes now for the end of the line employed in fishing.\n\nWhether certain trees are indigenous or not.\u2014Exception may perhaps be taken to the tun tree being enumerated as among the indigenous products of the district. It is very seldom seen, and is never cultivated as the mango, the mahua, and other trees are, so it is but natural to suppose that those which exist were self-sown. It never attains in this district the same size or height which it reaches in the forests of Oudh, and the same may be said of the shisham tree; but for this there are probably very good reasons independent of the prevalent idea that forest trees will not grow outside certain tracts of country. It will be generally admitted that these trees are essentially forest trees, and it would be well worth the while of Government to have plantations of them made on true forest principles, to see whether, when grown close together and subsequently thinned, they would not attain the same height and growth as their fellows of the forest. No tree will attain the same height when grown far from other trees that it will when closely surrounded, and it is natural to suppose that, owing to the clearance consequent on increasing population, the shisham and tun trees in this district grew gradually smaller till the species has deteriorated to the size of the specimens now extant, and probably in a few years if left to themselves they will become extinct. The same reasoning applies most probably to most so called forest trees, but there was a special reason for the extinction of the sal, \"Shorea robusta,\" which is called by the natives the \"sakhu\" tree. Sal trees are to be found to the south of the Dudhi, pargana Singrauli, south Mirzapur, probably not more than one hundred miles from Benares, but though covering vast tracts of waste land, it is seldom that a full-grown tree can be found, because the saplings are tapped by the lessees or contractors before they are eight years old for a juice which is then called \"dhup,\" and for which they get a ready sale in the bazars. The process kills the saplings in a month or two when the villagers cut down, stack, and just before the rains, set fire to them windward of a patch of ground which they want to break up; the people declaring all the time that although the seed of the sal tree germinates the tree cannot attain to any age or size in those parts. No clearer proof could be produced that it is the increase of population that destroys the indigenous products of districts, and that it is not the climate, nor the soil, but the destructive element in man that disagrees with these giants of the forest.\n\nThe seed of the sal tree germinates in this district.\u2014Babu Ajit Singh, a taluqdar in the Partabgarh district, and other Europeans and natives, have made efforts to raise the sal tree by seed in that and other districts, but till this year hitherto without any recorded success; up to the time of Nasir-ud-din Haidar there were sal trees near Char Bagh in\nLucknow, and some ground near goes by the name of S\u00e1kh\u016b-ka-B\u00e1gh to this day. There are now in this station over one hundred young plants raised from s\u00e1l seed sown last June. Many of which will doubtless attain to maturity if not forcibly uprooted or villainously tapped, or subjected to some other destructive treatment. A small plantation of tun and sh\u00edsham trees was made at Government expense in this district in the rainy season of 1868, and several of the trees had attained to a height of over twenty feet within three years, and the general result has made it evident that it rests with us to show why the next generation should not have better timber growing at their doors than we get now from the forest.\n\nWild cattle.\u2014Herds of wild cattle are to be found in the pargana of Daundia Khera* near the river Ganges, also in Salon near the Sai. They are generally very poor small animals, but occasionally a fine bull is to be seen among them. The natives catch the male calves, and they grow into tolerable bullocks. There is no difficulty in domesticating the cattle if caught young, but the females give little, almost no milk beyond what is necessary for rearing their offspring. The herds devastate the crops by night, and think nothing of clearing the low walls and small ditches by which the cultivators endeavour to check their depredations.\n\nThe fauna.\u2014The Ferae naturae are the same in Rae Bareli as in other parts of Oudh, but black buck are not found, except a very few near Bechhr\u00e1w\u00e1n; they are entirely absent from the southern portions of the district, although they have recently become numerous in Fatehpur across the river Ganges.\n\nNil-g\u00e1e are common near the Ganges; wolves are occasionally met with in the jungles. There are no tigers, leopards, spotted deer, gond (swamp deer), but with the exception of the above, which are confined to the Himalayan Tar\u00e1i in Oudh, the fauna is the same as that described under Kheri.\n\nClimate and rainfall.\u2014These are treated under their medical aspects a little further on. In this general sketch it may be remarked that the rainfall has averaged 37 inches during the last eleven years. There is a considerable difference in the returns of the tahsils.\n\nThe following are the returns for 1874:\n\n| Tahsil       | Rainfall |\n|--------------|----------|\n| Rae Bareli   | 37.7     |\n| Salon        | 47.5     |\n| Digbijalganj | 27.3     |\n| Lalganj      | 27.7     |\n\nThe two former tahsils both adjoin the river Sai, the other two lie north and south of them. Whatever the reason, the central tahsils have steadily exhibited a fair rainfall, and the other two a scanty one. Any rainfall less than 35 inches as a rule results in very inferior crops.\n\n* Now in the Unao district.\nAverage fall of rain in Rae Bareli district:\n\n| Years | Inches |\n|-------|--------|\n| 1865  | 27\u00b70   |\n| 1866  | 26\u00b70   |\n| 1867  | 60\u00b73   |\n| 1868  | 19\u00b74   |\n| 1869  | 38\u00b75   |\n| 1870  | 49\u00b74   |\n| 1871  | 49\u00b75   |\n| 1872  | 34\u00b75   |\n| 1873  | 41\u00b70   |\n| 1874  | 36\u00b70   |\n| 1875  | 33\u00b70   |\n\nAverage for eleven years: 37\u00b77\n\nThe rainfall is however very capricious, and caprice is the ruin of agriculture. A table is subjoined showing the rainfalls of that portion of agricultural years, viz., from June to February (during which alone rain falls) for the last two droughts, those of 1868 and 1873. These years, although differing much in the amount of rainfall, agree in that the rain was deficient in the critical month when the kharif is sown, viz., June; and stopped almost entirely during the five months, October, November, December, January, February, when the cold-weather crops are springing up and ripening. During this latter period in 1868 not a tenth of an inch fell, and in 1873 only one-third of an inch. But in 1873, there was a further misfortune, the rains did not commence till July 6th, consequently the ploughs, which cannot be worked till the ground is moistened, were idle, the ground was not broken up, and much of the land was left uncultivated owing to the pressure and hurry at last.\n\nIf favourable, the rains commence about June 5th; the fall in that month is about five inches; about nine inches fall in each of the next three months; there are four inches in October, ending about October 16th, and two inches in January or February; such a combination has not occurred since annexation.\n\nRae Bareli.\n\n|                | 1868 | 1873 |\n|----------------|------|------|\n| **TOTAL RAINFALL** |      |      |\n| Rainfall from June 1st to October 1st | 26\u00b765 | 42\u00b72 |\n| From October 1st to December 31st, | 0\u00b70  | 0\u00b70  |\n| In June | 3\u00b74  | 0\u00b70  |\n| In September | 11\u00b71 | 13\u00b72 |\n| In October | 0\u00b70  | 0\u00b70  |\n| Date of rain commencing | June 15th, | July 6th. |\n| Of rain ending | September 21st, | September 15th. |\n| Rain in January-February of ensuing year | 0\u00b70 | 0\u00b73 |\nThe following memorandum has been furnished by the civil surgeon:\n\n**MEDICAL ASPECTS.**\n\nStatistics of births were only taken in 1868 and 1869, and yielded insufficient averages. The birth-rate per thousand of population for the former period was only 28\u00b701, and for the latter period 29\u00b720.\n\nStatistics of deaths have been obtained through the agency of village chaukidars since 1868. The mortality of the last six years is exhibited in the following table:\n\n| Year | Population | Mortality from all causes | Rate per thousand of population |\n|------|------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| 1868 | 7,88,246   | 12,346                    | 15\u00b717                           |\n| 1869 | 7,83,874   | 27,914                    | 35\u00b765                           |\n| 1870 | 7,82,874   | 22,862                    | 29\u00b720                           |\n| 1871 | 9,89,008   | 22,268                    | 29\u00b751                           |\n| 1872 | 9,89,008   | 18,406                    | 18\u00b761                           |\n| 1873 | 9,89,008   | 17,815                    | 18\u00b701                           |\n\n**Endemic diseases.**\u2014The endemic diseases of the district are cholera, small-pox, and malarial fevers.\n\n**Cholera.**\u2014The following table gives the annual mortality from cholera of the last six years:\n\n| Year | Number of deaths from cholera | Rate per thousand of population |\n|------|------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| 1868 | 163                          | '21                             |\n| 1869 | 4,779                        | 6\u00b710                            |\n| 1870 | 619                          | 0\u00b779                            |\n| 1871 | 2,575                        | 2\u00b760                            |\n| 1872 | 2,563                        | 2\u00b761                            |\n| 1873 | 1,927                        | 1\u00b794                            |\n\nCholera in sporadic or epidemic form has only been absent from parts of the Rae Bareli district for short periods since 1868. Seasons of summer heat have been marked by increased prevalence of the disease. Every quarter of the district has within the last three years been visited by the malady in epidemic form. After commencing and remaining (from two to five weeks) in one or two villages, the disease has usually spread by\nsuccessive implication of other localities in their immediate or more remote neighbourhood. The cause of cholera has not been determined. Endeavours to connect outbreaks in particular places, with concurrent and exceptional insanitary influences in the surroundings and mode of life of affected communities, have resulted in failure. I am impressed with the belief that cases of the disease were greatly multiplied by the close association of the healthy with the sick in ill-ventilated and overcrowded dwellings.\n\nSmall-pox.\u2014The deaths from small-pox of the last six years are given in the following table:\n\n| Year | Number of deaths from small-pox | Rate per thousand of population |\n|------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| 1868 | 659                            | '84                             |\n| 1869 | 2,036                          | 8\u00b786                            |\n| 1870 | 2,478                          | 3\u00b715                            |\n| 1871 | 697                            | 0\u00b770                            |\n| 1872 | 211                            | 0\u00b721                            |\n| 1873 | 763                            | 0\u00b771                            |\n\nExcept when epidemic in 1869 and 1870 this disease has not been extraordinarily destructive. Vaccination is being gradually extended outwards from the sadr station, and a notable decrease in the prevalence of small-pox within protected areas must ensue. This result will bring conviction of the efficacy of vaccination to the minds of the people, and the number who annually consent to the operation may increase in consequence.\n\nFevers.\u2014The deaths reported in the last six years as due to fevers are included in the following table:\n\n| Year | Number of reported deaths from fevers | Rate per thousand of population |\n|------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| 1868 | 6,637                                 | 8\u00b747                            |\n| 1869 | 10,820                                | 13\u00b782                           |\n| 1870 | 14,330                                | 18\u00b730                           |\n| 1871 | 16,654                                | 16\u00b783                           |\n| 1872 | 14,970                                | 15\u00b713                           |\n| 1873 | 14,716                                | 14\u00b787                           |\n\nAs it is a well known fact that natives of this country ascribe all deaths from primary ailments of special organs to fever (vernacular \"bukhr\u00e1\"),\nthe malarious character of the country, included in the Rae Bareli district, is not established by the large figures of mortality exhibited under this heading.\n\nThe nature of the soil of the district (which is sand and alluvium on kankar beds) does not favour the production of malaria by retention of moisture, and there exist only small and isolated patches of jungle lands which have not yet been cleared and brought under cultivation.\n\nThe elevation of the district above the sea is about 430 feet, and surface drainage is effected by channels leading to the river Ganges and to the Sai, Naiya, and Loni rivers. Water-bearing strata are reached at an average depth of about 30 feet below the ground level in hot and dry seasons, and at about 12 or 14 feet after wet seasons.\n\nTemporary and abundant sources of malaria are in existence annually while rice swamps in the district are drying after the rains, when periodic fevers prevail very generally for two or three months, and prove speedily fatal when of remittent type. During other periods of the year the suffering from such ailments is comparatively inconsiderable. Organic and constitutional derangements, resulting from recurring attacks of fever, come frequently under observation at the dispensary, and often prove intractable.\n\nCattle epidemics.\u2014I learn from the people that extraordinary mortality from disease has now and then within some years back occurred amongst herds of cattle in particular parganas of the Rae Bareli district. Agriculturists are familiar with the symptoms of foot and mouth disease which they designate \"khanj,\" \"khurha,\" and \"ghurkha.\" They also speak of another and more formidable contagious ailment of very fatal character to which cattle have at times been subject. This latter disease is known by the names \"hulka,\" \"dhumsa,\" \"hijab,\" \"bura-\u00e1z\u00e1r,\" and is most probably identical in nature with rinderpest. It does not appear that cattle in the district have yet suffered from the extension of cultivation at the expense of the pasture lands.\n\nFairs and religious gatherings.\u2014Bathing fairs at Dalmau and Gokuna, both places with gh\u00e1ts on the banks of the Ganges, are held at every full moon. Usually three or four thousand people collect together on such occasions, but in November when the \"K\u00e1rtik k\u00e1 nah\u00e1n mela\" is celebrated, about one hundred and fifty thousand people assemble at each of the two gh\u00e1ts. No commercial object is fulfilled by these gatherings. The stream of the Ganges is held sacred, and bathing therein with religious ceremonials the only object of the multitudes. No connection has yet been traced between these assemblages and epidemic attacks in the district.\n\nNative system of medical treatment.\u2014The physicians of the country are ignorant of surgery. Their practice is founded on obsolete humoral doctrines of pathology. In the treatment of disease they employ remedies which produce effects that are opposite in nature to the symptoms.\nCHAPTER II.\n\nAGRICULTURE AND COMMERCE.\n\nAgriculture\u2014Renta\u2014Agricultural statistics from the settlement report\u2014Irrigation\u2014Advances and land improvements\u2014prices and famines\u2014Food of the people\u2014Fish\u2014Manufactures and trades\u2014Means of communication\u2014Extracts from the route book\u2014Weights and measures.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014The principal occupation of the people is agriculture. It is not necessary here to detail the different processes and crops which are much the same as in the adjoining district of Partabgarh and are there described. The rotation of crops, the crops sown, the implements, the outturn, are much the same. Irrigation depends not so much upon the agriculturist's habits, which are monotonous and uniform as upon natural features which differ in each district. The following remarks are from the settlement report, and other sources severally indicated. It may be premised that speaking generally the agricultural features of Rae Bareli are\u2014a great deal of rice, wheat, arhar, gram, opium, and comparatively little maize, sugarcane, and tobacco. The accompanying table shows the opium area and outturn; it will appear that the produce is much greater than that of the two adjoining districts, Sultanpur and Partabgarh taken, together:\n\n| Districts       | Area (1872-73) | Area (1873-74) | Maunds (1872-73) | Maunds (1873-74) | Sers (1872-73) | Sers (1873-74) |\n|-----------------|---------------|---------------|------------------|------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Rae Bareli      | 7,692         | 7,816         | 1,178            | 1,768            | 8             | 34            |\n| Sultanpur       | 4,103         | 3,842         | 470              | 759              | 4             | 25            |\n| Partabgarh      | 1,688         | 3,079         | 367              | 574              | 8             | 2             |\n|                 | 13,863        | 13,737        | 2,015            | 3,102            | 20            | 21            |\n\nAverage produce per acre,\n\n| Rent of land suitable for | Rs. a. p. per acre |\n|---------------------------|--------------------|\n| Rice                      | 4 4 0              |\n| Wheat                     | 8 8 0              |\n| Inferior grain            | 4 4 0              |\n| Opium                     | 9 9 0              |\n| Oil seeds                 | 4 8 0              |\n| Sugar                     | 9 6 0              |\n| Tobacco                   | 11 4 0             |\n| Cotton                    | 9 9 0              |\nThe highest rents are for opium lands in the vicinity of the towns, such pay up to Rs. 13 the bigha, or Rs. 20-12-0 per acre. Ordinary wheat lands, irrigated by the tenants' own wells, let up to Rs. 7 the bigha, or Rs. 11-3-0 per acre, and unirrigated lands, in which nothing can be grown but gram, barley, and arhar, let at Rs. 5 the bigha, or Rs. 8 the acre, if the soil is not very sandy.\n\nWhen the land is very sandy, and very remote from the village site, so that it is impossible to manure it except at a prohibitive cost, rents fall as low as one rupee an acre. The above figures are not meant to embrace the cases of tenures granted on favourable terms to tenants of high caste or recently settled. The rents have been much raised of late years.\n\nThe following is from the settlement report:\n\n\"Outturn.\u2014The following are approximate statistics. One man with one pair of bullocks can cultivate fairly about four acres per annum, from which he may calculate on an average annual yield of twelve maunds of grain per acre, or forty-eight maunds of grain per annum. The present average value of this, together with the straw, is about ninety-six rupees, and taking the landlord's share at one-third, the rental of the holding should be about Rs. 32, or Rs. 8 per acre.\n\n\"Seed per acre.\u2014The amount of seeds for a crop of wheat averages about a maund and a half per acre.\n\n\"Hired labour.\u2014Labourers are paid chiefly in grain, and so are village servants.\n\n\"Village servants.\u2014Under this denomination come\u2014\n\n| Watchers. | Herdsmen. |\n| Astrologers. | Barbers. |\n| Blacksmiths. | Washermen. |\n| Carpenters. | Kah\u00e1rs (p\u00e1lki-bearers). |\n| Priests. | Potters. |\n| Ploughmen. |\n\n\"Some of these get sometimes grants of lands. The Kah\u00e1rs are employed to draw water and for other purposes. Besides the above many Brahmans and mendicants are entitled to what is called \"anjuri,\" or both hands filled with grain before its removal from the threshing floor.\n\n\"Agricultural seasons.\u2014The agricultural operations are conducted according to certain astronomical divisions of time into which the rainy season is divided.\n\n\"Thus in 1871\u2014\n\n| Mirgi\u015bara commenced on the 6th June. |\n| \u0100dra ditto 20th |\n| Punarbas ditto 4th July. |\n| Pakkh ditto 18th |\n| Ashlekh\u0101 ditto 1st August. |\n| Magha ditto 15th |\n| J'\u016brba ditto 29th |\n| Uttra ditto 13th September. |\n| Hast ditto 26th |\n| Chitra ditto 9th October. |\n\"The dates on which these divisions commence are ascertained from pandits, and the different kinds of seeds are sown accordingly. For instance, early sowings of rice commence in Ardra, and the latest can be made in Pukkh; ju\u00e1r, mak\u00e1i, (Indian corn), arhar can be sown at the same time; m\u00fang, moth, urd are sown later till Magha. Reaping of the rain crops commences from Uttra, or about the middle of September, and continues for two months or more.\n\n\"Festivals and superstitions.\u2014On the occasion of the Guria festival, which takes place on 5th S\u00e1wan Sudi, 23rd July, 1871, no one ploughs or weeds. On 6th Bh\u00e1don Badi, 6th August, 1871, occurs \"Harchhath, a fast day in this district for women, on which no ploughing or weeding is done here. On the last day of Ashlekha and the 1st Magha it is in some places considered unlucky to plough or weed.\n\n\"Lessened fertility of the land.\u2014People say that the land is not as fertile as it used to be twenty years ago. Doubtless since annexation it has had less rest than it used to have during the native rule.\n\n\"Local methods of irrigation from wells.\u2014Everybody is familiar with the sight of the long rope passed over a pulley, to the former of which are attached a leathern bag at one end and a pair of bullocks at the other. The bags used in this district are small because the bullocks are small; they contain about twelve gallons of water, and if worked well are capable of bringing between 600 and 700 gallons to the surface per hour. Some of this falls back into the well in the effort to hand the bag, and much of it is lost by soakage and evaporation before it reaches the crop. Hence it often takes as many as eight days to irrigate an acre in this way.\n\n\"Cost of irrigation from wells.\u2014A man and a pair of bullocks can be hired in the station of Rae Bareli for five annas per diem, which makes the cost of irrigating one acre once Rs. 2-8-0, or from Rs. 15 to Rs. 20 per season; but this is hired labour, and the cost to cultivators, who have their own bullocks, cannot be calculated at this rate.\n\n\"From marshes and ponds.\u2014The 'beri' or 'dugla' is a basket with strings fastened to each end; it is worked by two men standing on either side of a narrow cut open towards the water supply and dammed at the other end. By a succession of easy and graceful movements one side of the basket is swept just below the surface of the water in the cut; it is lifted brimful over the level of the dam, there upset by a dexterous action of the wrist, and returned to its original position in very much less time than it takes to describe the process. Two baskets are frequently worked at one cut, the men being relieved regularly at intervals of from ten to twenty minutes. The labour is really hard, and generally persevered in from early dawn to sunset, with the intermission of about one hour at noon. The water has often to be taken far and lifted high. In November, 1868, fifty-one men were employed irrigating some fields near Katghar in the Dalmau pargana in the above manner; supposing that there were with reliefs eight men at each lift, and giving a raise of three feet and a half for each, the water must have been raised about twenty feet.\"\n\"Cost of irrigation from ponds and marshes.\u2014This gang managed to irrigate 2\u00bd acres per diem, and calculating their wages at one anna and a half per man per diem, the cost of irrigation was about Rs. 2-0-0 per acre. About seven gallons of water are raised about three feet and a half at each delivery of a common sized basket, and the process can be repeated by men working easily at least six hundred times, which gives over four thousand gallons in the hour.\n\n\"Artificial reservoirs.\u2014Rights in wells are clear, and are seldom, if ever, called in question. With regard to artificial reservoirs, two classes may be said to exist\u2014(1) those in the case of which the excavator or his heir is living and in possession, and (2) those in which all rights have lapsed. In the former case, after taking as much water as his purpose requires, the owner usually allows the privilege of irrigation to such cultivators of the village or neighbouring villages as he pleases. In the latter case, however, it is usual for the lord of the manor to first irrigate his sir lands, afterwards those cultivators, whose lands are situated within reach of the water, appoint a committee to estimate the contents of the reservoir, and the amount of land which it is proposed to irrigate. The amount of water to which each man is entitled is then apportioned in 'dauris.' The dauri contains about five gallons, and the 'dugla' rather more than twice as much.\n\n\"Depth of water.\u2014The maximum depth of water in this district is 78 feet, and to be found in village Bigabpur Kal\u00e1n, pargana Magr\u00e1yar, the minimum is eight feet in village P\u00e1ra Khurd, pargana Hardoi. During the heavy rains of 1868, the river Sai rose to within twelve feet of the general ground level of the station, whilst the water in wells not far from the banks, remained at their normal level of about twenty feet from the surface. On the 21st September, 1871, the river rose to within twelve feet of the ground level of a compound three hundred yards distant, in which is a well, the water in which on the same date was twenty-five feet below the same level.\n\n\"Pakka wells.\u2014The assessment returns show 11,560 kachcha to 10,501 pakka wells; pakka wells are properly those of which the chambers are made of kiln-burnt bricks and mortar; but wells of which the chambers are made of kiln-burnt bricks, joined with clay, are also so called. The cost of construction of pakka wells varies from Rs. 50 to Rs. 200.\n\n\"Kachcha wells.\u2014Kachcha wells are properly those which have no interior supporting walls or chambers below the water level, but wells are also called kachcha in which there are such chambers made of potters bricks, wood, or twig fascines. The cost of making a kachcha well varies from two or three to thirty rupees and over. Potter's bricks differ from common bricks, only in being of such a shape that a certain number put together will form a circle; some are made in wooden frames, but the larger ones are made by drawing concentric circles on prepared earth when it becomes consistent, and then cutting the bricks of an uniform size and burning them in a kiln. It is said that these bricks are generally made by 'kumh\u00e1ra' or potters, hence their name.\"\nDistribution of water by the 'bachh' system extensively prevails in this district, and, being regulated by a sort of standing panchayat, tends to reconcile malcontents who would otherwise come into court. The patwari is ordinarily ex-officio member of the panchayat, the remaining three or four members being either zamindars, muqaddams, or other respectable residents. It has come to my knowledge that a practice has begun to prevail in some parts of levying irrigation dues, or in other words of selling water. Pahikast (non-resident) cultivators requiring the commodity are made to pay 8 annas per diem for each 'rik,' or raising station, which they work.\n\nWells lately made in this district.\u2014One hundred and four pakka wells, at a total cost of Rs. 19,760, were constructed in this district during the year ending 30th September, 1876. The details are as follows:\n\n| Wells | Cost |\n|-------|------|\n| By Chhatris | 27 | 5,965 |\n| Brahmins | 21 | 4,400 |\n| Bhats | 3 | 300 |\n| Musselmans | 10 | 2,140 |\n| Kurmis | 3 | 575 |\n| Baqqal | 3 | 960 |\n| Lodhas | 3 | 300 |\n| Kayaths | 4 | 1,000 |\n| Ahirs | 19 | 2,980 |\n| Pasis | 2 | 250 |\n| Murdos | 6 | 950 |\n| Barhis | 1 | 100 |\n| Telis | 1 | 150 |\n| European (Captain Bunbury) | 1 | 250 |\n\nTotal | 104 | 19,760 |\n\nThis return has been obtained from the district records which do not show how many of these men are proprietors.\"\n\nThe following memorandum on irrigation in Rae Bareli has been contributed by Mr. P. Gartlan, a resident of the district:\n\n\"As regards wells in my part of Oudh, that is, in the tahsil of Salon in the Rae Bareli district, circumstances change from village to village. In some places water is met at 40 feet, at others at 24 and 30 feet, and at others at 12 and 15 feet below the surface. The spring is found now at 65 or 70 feet, now at 45 feet, and now at 30 feet below the surface. Wells are often sunk below 65 feet from surface, without a spring being met with. I have myself constructed wells under the foregoing circumstances, and have seen many such constructed by neighbouring zamindars (few) and asamis. Success in sinking a well does not depend so much on the depth to which the wooden foundation has to be sunk as on the quality of soil through which it has to go. Where pure sand is met above the water level it is walled up from the firm clay, and the actual well is sunk inside of this circular wall; but where the sand is met below the water level, it is next to impossible to succeed in constructing a well fit for irrigation, except by improved scientific means which do not always succeed, and which owing to expense are beyond the reach of zamindars or asamis. I have tried Bull's patent dredger with sand, through which I managed to\nsink a pakka chuna cylinder about 16 feet below water level, without reaching clay, and owing to the sand bursting through the sides of the cylinder, I failed in procuring a successful sinking. The asami with his limited means is helpless where sand is to be found under water level.\n\n\"I cannot say how long pakka wells will last, but I would say, that if properly built, and of good bricks, no well should give way before 60 or 70 years. In speaking of pakka wells, I mean wells built of pakka (burnt) bricks with mud mortar, not lime; for wells built with lime mortar are too expensive for the cultivator. Wells built with small bricks are stronger, and last better than wells built with block bricks or with phaura-shaped bricks.\n\n\"Block bricks are not now used, but the phaura-shaped bricks are general; a well can be constructed much cheaper with the latter than with small brick. Rs. 300 would on an average be a fair price for a well, of ordinary size on which eight purs could be worked; but such wells, under ordinary circumstances, can be built by asamis for sums varying from Rs. 80 to Rs. 150 each according to depth of well and quality of soil. Zamin-dars and asamis for their brick-kiln get their timber free, their manure free, their kanda free; for the well itself, the bamboos are seldom paid for, the necessary timber is free, no new purs or well ropes are made for the sinking operations, and the labourers are paid cheaply and have much work got out of them. Where land is of first quality, a well, such as described by Mr. Chapman for irrigating 30 bighas, would enable the landlord to enhance the rent by one rupee per bigha without oppressing the tenant, and, where the land was formerly not irrigated, should enable him to put on a greater enhancement, especially where brackish water is obtainable, when the rent can be doubled and trebled.\n\n\"Wells do very often give way after a few years, but it is generally owing to faulty construction, such as insufficient filling in behind the wall, or leaving the wooden foundation on unsafe clay, or digging a kachcha well inside, which after a time falls in, and brings the pakka superstructure down with it. Trees such as fig, gulal, palak, bargad, or pipal growing in the interstices of the bricks do much damage to pakka wells. No repairs ought to be necessary to a well within ten years of its construction, and if an unfailing spring has been reached, there will be no necessity of even clearing out the well. A well on which the full complement of purs is worked is less liable to deteriorate than a well which is seldom used. Generally speaking the natives execute no repairs to their pakka wells, but allow them to crumble to ruins when a slight expenditure on repairs would save them.\n\n\"Except in known localities there is no certainty of reaching an unfailing spring, and of late years, owing to excessive rains, the water level has risen, and the filtration of the subsoil has become so abundant, that it has been very difficult to sink the cylinder far enough to reach the genuine spring. The ordinary filtration of the subsoil would not suffice to irrigate 30 bighas of spring crops, though it may suffice to keep a couple of purs at work all day. The fact of the water getting low in a well could not put a stop to irrigation, so long as there is sufficient water in the well for the pur to sink in. Many wells, pakka and kachcha, are exhausted before noon\nwith only one pur working. No as\u00e1mis would rely on such a well for irri-\ngation though he might reserve alongside such a well a biswa or two for\ncarrots and perhaps ten biswas or so for wheat, barley, or peas. The con-\nditions of soil are seldom so favourable as to allow kachcha wells being\ndug with any certainty of permanence, but where practicable they are dug\nand sometimes last for many years; generally speaking only one pur is\nworked on a kachcha well owing to its limited diameter. The fact of a\nkachcha well being in a given locality not feasible is no reason why the con-\nstruction of a pakka well in the same locality should be expensive.\n\n\"Under no circumstances could one pair of bullocks or six men work-\ning a pur irrigate a pakka bigha per day. Under favourable circumstances,\nwith water at 12 to 15 feet below the surface, and land not sandy, three to\nfour purs would water a bigha in a day; where water is far from the surface,\nand land sandy, six to eight purs would water a bigha per day; a second\nwatering can be done in less time.\n\n\"With a dhenkli or a ghara a pakka bigha can be watered in from six\nto nine days. In this part of the country bullock labour only is used to\nwork purs for irrigation. The cost of irrigation from wells, including\nlabourers, bullocks and gear, varies from Re. 1 to Rs. 2-4-0 per bigha.\nThe ordinary cultivator having gear, &c., at his disposal merely pays in\ngrain his hired labourers.\n\n\"Generally several as\u00e1mis work their purs in common, each man's holding\nbeing watered by turn, thus effecting a saving; the pur, not the land irri-\ngated, forms the basis of their calculations.\n\n\"Wages.\u2014Wages are not paid in cash but in grain, which varies in\nquantity according to kind of grain; dh\u00e1n, barley, peas, chana, or mindwa;\nthe latter would not be accepted alone; the quantity also varies according\nto the work to be executed. The weeder and ploughman generally get from\n1\u00bd to 2 sers, while the labourer at the lift in jhfl irrigation gets as much\nas 3 sers per day, if at work before dawn. When cash wages are given, I\nbelieve four pice and five pice per day are given for ordinary work. For\nother than ordinary work slightly higher wages are given. Men digging\ninside a well sometimes get two annas per day. I pay women and boys as\nweeders, earth carriers, irrigation coolies, or threshing-floor coolies at the\nrate of one anna per day; able-bodied coolies from one anna eight pies to\ntwo annas each per day. At these rates labourers are procurable in any\nnumbers all the year round. Carpenters, blacksmiths, masons, &c., get\nfrom three to four annas each per day.\n\n\"With reference to the interest which capital expended on wells will\npay, I refrain from giving any opinion, for the land under my charge is\npeculiarly unfavourable for experiments in this line. Our land is either\nthe uneven n\u00e1las bordering the Ganges and the Sai, or \u00fasar lands in which\ndh\u00e1n is sown, with but patches here and there of good soil fit for winter\ncrops. However, the many wells which we have constructed have not\nonly enabled us to keep up the rents of lands once rich but now exhaust-\ned, but have also allowed our enhancing the former rent where the land\nwas of first quality. There is an indirect as well as direct profit from con-\nstruction of wells; in a village with wells watering say one-third of the cultivated area, you are always able to let out the other two-thirds at fair rents to the cultivators of the former.\n\n\"My part of the district is, as you are probably aware, densely populated, and there is a steady competition for land in most villages. A pakka well, in which the water supply is insufficient to keep at work the full complement of purs, would scarcely pay any interest on the capital expended. In speaking of pakka wells, I consider an ordinary well ought to be about $7\\frac{1}{2}$ or 8 feet in diameter, and on such a well eight purs could be worked. In 1869 I built a pakka well 13\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) feet in diameter, and on this well, in the November of same year, I worked 18 purs daily for three days consecutively without being able to exhaust the water supply, the depth of water each evening varying from 9 to 10 feet. This well is sixty-six feet deep, the water levels being 36 feet from surface. Except on specified cases, it would be difficult to give you any precise details about wells, for circumstances so change the aspects of the subject, that what is common in one locality is impossible in another. Again, the water found in some wells possesses peculiar properties. Brackish water, suitable for tobacco, poppy, s\u00e1nw\u00e1n, &c., is invaluable, and enables the cultivator to pay excessively high rents for the land irrigated therewith.\"\n\nAdditional note by Mr. Gartlan.\u2014\"As I mentioned in my former letter on the subject, purs are not worked in my neighbourhood with coolies at the pull, when water is drawn for irrigation purposes. Men are only used to work the pur or baskets when a well cylinder is being sunk. The pakka bigha to which I refer equals 3,025 square yards, and the purs worked in my part of the country contain from 10 to 12 gallons of water. The pur which I use, and which is extensively used, contains when new about 3,400 cubic inches of water.\n\n\"I think, however, that a pur worked by men will water one and a half times as much land as a pur worked by bullocks will do in the same time. You calculate that a pur worked by six men will cost nine annas, your calculation strikes me as moderate. The cost per pur worked by bullocks is something varying from five to six annas per day. As an asmi has not to pay ready cash in his irrigation operations, he does not realize to himself what the irrigation per bigha has cost him.\n\n\"Were canal water to have no evil effects on the soil, we should certainly be glad to get the water as often as required during the season at the small cost of Rs. 2 per acre per annum. A permanent water rate would be disliked, the cultivator preferring of course to pay only for the water he might take; for in many seasons one watering is all that the crop requires.\n\n\"In my former letter, when I stated that irrigation cost from Re. 1 to Rs. 2-4-0 per bigha, I meant that each irrigation cost about those amounts, and that consequently three irrigations for wheat would cost Rs. 3 per bigha at the least. I consider this latter estimate moderate. At the present day, one well rope and one pur cost Rs. 3, and they only last one year; no other cash expenditure is incurred in well irrigation by the asmi who employs no hired labour, and has not to dig his own well. Irrigation\nfrom jhils costs about the same thing as well irrigation; here again, the quality of soil, the number of lifts, and the distance of the fields cause the cost per bigha to vary. Crops watered with well water thrive better than crops watered with jhil water.\"\n\nThe following note describes the cost of irrigation in northern Rae Bareli, as the preceding account is of the southern part of the district:\n\n\"Near Rae Bareli itself water is 21 feet from the surface when nearest and 27 feet in some places, but the springs are met with at 45 to 60 feet. A well for three or four purs cost 400 if of a strong and permanent character. Here a system of half reliefs is adopted for the bullocks, two pairs are employed, and a third pair as a relief every second hour, each pair thus works six hours, and two pairs are constantly at work during a nine-hour day. The three pairs water ten biswas a day if the field is at an average distance, but more if it is close at hand. The leather bags are of different sizes\u2014from seven to twelve spans round the mouth is the popular mode of estimation.\n\n\"The diameter of the water skin ranges from $5\\frac{1}{2}$ to $7\\frac{1}{2}$ balisht. The village people reckon one balisht as equal to a ghara of water of the ordinary size, and the ghara they consider capable of holding six sers of water. A skin of the average size ($6\\frac{1}{2}$ balishts) will be found to hold about 40 sers or a maund of water.\"\n\nIn the portion of Rae Bareli which lies between the Sai and the Gumti the facilities and modes of irrigation resemble those already described under Lucknow, except that the features of irrigation common to eastern Oudh, show themselves markedly, viz., masonry wells are very numerous, and the labour is generally that of cattle.\n\nThrough the centre of the tract water is near the surface, being met with sometimes at 15 feet; the spring, however, is not reached till a depth of 30 feet has been attained. A cylinder of bricks without mortar for such a depth will cost Rs. 60 if broad enough for only one bucket, for two Rs. 90; the addition of mortar will make the cost about Rs. 90 and Rs. 130 respectively. From these wells the crops will be irrigated at the rate of ten biswas a day with the aid of two pairs of bullocks, changed at noon, and three men who work all day\u2014one driving the cattle, one emptying the bucket, one distributing the water in the field.\n\nAllowing one anna for each bullock, and two annas for each man, the cost will be ten annas per day, Re. 1-4-0 for a bigha, and Rs. 2 for an acre, for one watering. Interest on Rs. 60, the cost of a single bucket well, at Re. 1-8-0 per cent. per month, the ordinary rate will be Rs. 10 per annum. The area which such a well will supply with water during the year is 10 acres, the cost then of irrigating an acre twice will be Rs. 4 for labour and Re. 1 for interest. But this must be taken as below the average cost of well irrigation; water is more often about nineteen feet distant, and the quantity of land irrigated in a day is only seveh biswas. Then the cost will be Rs. 2-13-0 for one watering, Rs. 5-11-0 for two, besides Re. 1 per acre for interest. These figures certainly are\n\n* Kinlock's Statistics of Fatehpur, page 18.\nrather striking at first sight; not only does the cost of irrigation appear extravagant, double and treble what canal water costs, but it seems impossible that it would pay to irrigate wheat or barley three times as is commonly the case in this district.\n\nIt is impossible to value either the human or cattle labour at a lower rate than is here estimated. Mr. Halsey, of Cawnpore, values bullock labour in a similar calculation at three annas a head, and one anna per day is rather less than the sum which will feed a bullock, pay the interest on its value, and the required quota to a sinking fund to replace it when dead or decrepid. Two annas is the rate actually paid to men who work at the wells all day; those who only labour half the day get 1\u00bd. The labour rates then seem unimpeachable; it seems impossible that it can pay to give three waterings. Wheat watered once will give 900 lbs to the acre, watered three times it will not exceed 1,250 lbs.\u2014a difference of 350 lbs., worth on the average Rs. 8 for an increased expenditure of Rs. 6-11-0. This would pay, but in many fields the crop is never more than 1,000 lbs., even after three waterings; its value then will be about Rs. 25 for grain and Rs. 5 for straw. Rent will be Rs. 8, ploughing Rs. 8, seed Rs. 2, weeding Rs. 2, manure Rs. 3, reaping and thrashing Rs. 2\u2014in all Rs. 25. It is apparent then that watering even twice will not pay.\n\nThe people of Rae Bareli are industrious, and apparently would rather work in their own fields even when they might obtain more by hiring themselves out. Further, when as is generally the case the cattle are their own, it is better to employ them even if the result will only pay half their keep than that they should be idle. The people, however, quite understand that watering is very expensive, and they abstain in this tract from the cultivation of sugarcane, tobacco, and other crops requiring much water. If canal water were introduced, the cattle thus partially deprived of employ would be profitably used in pressing sugarcane, carting fuel and manure, ploughing more land. At present hardly any sugarcane and little tobacco are grown in the district, the main reason being apparently the scarcity of water.\n\nNo permanent embankments of the rivers have been made, and the tanks made by the Bhars are not so numerous as in Partabgarh. The estates of the different land owners are a good deal intermixed, and the more intelligent of them give this as a reason for their inactivity. The Sai and Naiya rivers have high steep banks, and in many places might be embanked with great advantage to the surrounding crops. The Oudh Government in 1858 issued a circular containing advice and instructions on the subject.\n\nSome very interesting statistics on the subject of wells are given by Major Orr of Rae Bareli. Since annexation he had constructed 20 wells for irrigation purposes up till September, 1873; their average width was 8\u00bd feet, the average depth to which they were sunk 44 feet, of which 19\u00bd feet were filled with water; the average cost was Rs. 277, and six leather buckets could be used at once from each well. Of these wells seven were not sunk to the spring, and would not probably irrigate more than six acres of ground each, the other 13 would irrigate 15 acres each\u2014in all 237 acres, or say 200 acres. The rent\nof this land might in the course of some years be raised from Rs. 5 to Rs. 8 per acre in consideration of the supply of water, the receipts then would be Rs. 600 per annum or 11 per cent.; but making allowance for the proportion of failures of wells which fell in, and for the accumulation of interest before the rents are raised, the landlord would consider himself fortunate if he got 7 per cent. These wells are made without mortar, and at least 2 per cent. would have to be deducted from this sum for repairs and replacing fallen wells by new ones. On the other hand, this deduction should be more than counterbalanced by the increased security from bad debts which the landlord attains. A masonry well saves the crop from drought, and the rents are paid up even in dry seasons. On the whole, a prudent and careful investor in irrigation wells should expect 7 per cent. for his money, and as he can get 10 or 15 per cent. by loans to agriculturists, we need not wonder at mere capitalists not being tempted into this speculation. Other points of interest may be noted. In no less than six of these wells water was reached at an average depth of 14 feet. The greatest depth at which water was met was 42 feet, the greatest depth to which the well was sunk before reaching the spring was 67 feet. The average cost of a six pur well would appear to be Rs. 9 per cubit of masonry, being cheaper than in Lucknow.\n\nConstruction of masonry wells.\u2014\u201cA site having been chosen, a circular excavation or \u2018dahal\u2019 is commenced of a diameter considerably larger (for convenience of working) than that of the intended well. This excavation is carried on until the moist nature of the earth reached, shows signs of water being near. The \u2018niw\u00e1r\u2019 or circular rim of wood of the proper size is then lowered down and placed on the ground, and on this as a foundation is commenced the brick-work or \u2018girgaz\u2019 of the well which in the first instance is only raised to a certain height, so as to weight the niw\u00e1r and cause it to descend as afterwards explained. The excavation is then proceeded with, but now within the cylinder or girgaz just constructed, and the niw\u00e1r, with the brickwork resting on it having no longer a support, sinks to the extent of the depth excavated; at the same time the water, which generally at this stage of the work oozes out plentifully, has to be constantly drawn away. The excavation continues and again the niw\u00e1r sinks, and thus the operation is repeated until at last the spring or m\u00fasl\u00e1 is reached, when it only remains to complete the brickwork resting on the niw\u00e1r, raising it to the level of the upper soil.\n\n\u201cFrom the above description, it will, I hope, be easily seen how much the cost of construction of wells depends on the nature of the soil to be traversed before reaching the spring. We will suppose that two wells of equal dimensions have been built, either in the same village or in different localities. We will also suppose that the spring in each was found at an equal depth, and that the bricks employed in the construction of these two wells were of the same dimensions and cemented with mud. Still under conditions so similar the cost of construction may widely differ. In the one instance the soil excavated may have been of clay nearly throughout, and the brick cylinder may have been made to sink without any difficulty; in the other instance, the soil may have been excavated under very great difficulties for sand, or sand partaking more or less of the nature of quick-\nsand may have been encountered, thus rendering the sinking of the brickwork a difficult and, in many cases, a dangerous operation, necessitating great precautions and of course additional expense. In one of my villages, 'Jahowa Sherki,' in a well under construction, the girgaz had been lowered to a considerable depth, when suddenly it sank into quicksand, and was thrown so much out of the perpendicular that it was damaged beyond remedy, and the work could not be continued. Again, in another village, 'Umri,' a large well was being constructed, the girgaz had nearly reached the spring when its further progress was arrested by the niwar resting on one side on a projection of kankar rock. Fortunately in this case the brick cylinder remained in a vertical position, but it was with the utmost difficulty that this obstacle was removed, and the work brought to a successful termination, but of course under great additional cost.\n\n\"In some cases it happens when sand prevails to a great extent, that before the spring is reached, and consequently before the brick cylinder has been completed to the surface of the upper soil, that the earth above the cylinder shows large cracks, indicating a tendency to fall inwards; to avert this danger, all attempts to sink the girgaz down to the spring are abandoned, and the brickwork to the upper level of the ground is completed with all despatch. This done, a second 'niwar' is laid down, smaller of course than the one first employed, and on it another girgaz is erected and sunk, as before explained, to the spring; such a well is styled a 'do-band' or double-walled one. Here the cost is nearly double to what it would have been had there been only a single cylinder, whilst at the same time the capacity of the well for yielding water in a given time is lessened from the fact of its diameter being decreased through a great portion of its depth, for of course fewer purs can be employed.\n\n\"Besides the above there are other though minor circumstances which affect the cost of wells. For instance, the mud suitable for making bricks may be at a greater or less distance from the site of the well, necessitating a greater or less amount of cost in the transit of the bricks; the same may be said of the wood for feeding the brick-kiln; it may be obtainable at a\ndistance from the latter or in its immediate vicinity. Finally the costs will differ according to the bricks employed; *cateris paribus*, a well constructed with the common thin brick, will cost more than one built with the thick or 'furohi' brick. One point, it seems to me, it is most important to consider in the valuation of wells, and that is whether they have been sunk down to the spring or 'm\u00fasl\u00e1' or not. For it is evident, that whatever may have been the respective costs of (say) two wells of equal dimensions, the one fed by a spring will be more valuable than the other, which only holds water by filtration; for the latter will be quickly exhausted when worked for purposes of irrigation, so that the actual cost of construction of a well does not always represent its real agricultural value.\"\n\n*Taq\u00e1vi advances and land improvements.*\u2014Taq\u00e1vi advances are made by Government at a low rate of interest, 6 per cent., to defray the cost of agricultural improvements. During the seven years (1868-74,) 127 wells and 16 embankments were constructed at a cost of Rs. 29,250, an average expenditure of Rs. 4,170 per annum, and an increase to the irrigating facilities of the district of 18 wells. In addition to these, however, 65 wells at a cost of Rs. 11,825 were made during the years 1873-74 at the private expense of the owners.\n\nWe may say, then, that 50 wells per annum are made, watering perhaps 600 acres, and at a cost of Rs.10,000. The rent-roll of the district amounts to about Rs. 27,00,000; it does not seem sufficient that the people only invest \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\) of the incomes drawn from the land upon its permanent improvement.\n\n*Prices and famine prices.*\u2014The general subject of prices need hardly be touched upon. They have risen, but there are no exact statistics exhibiting to what extent. The return of prices called for by the Secretary of State from 1861 to 1870 is subjoined. It is however very incorrect. Paddy is entered at 31\u00bd sers in Sultanpur for the ten years, it cannot therefore have averaged 21\u00bd sers per rupee in Rae Bareli, the adjoining district. Wheat is entered at 17\u00bd sers per rupee, and in Sultanpur at 21\u00bd; the latter seems correct. On further testing the return by individual years, there seems still more reason to doubt its accuracy. In 1869, the year of scarcity, the average price of wheat is entered at 10\u00bd sers per rupee; but on taking the monthly returns from the official Gazette, the average from July to November, the season of highest prices, comes to 11\u00bd sers per rupee, and the year's average would be nearly 13 sers. Another and more trustworthy table prepared for the settlement department gives the price of wheat for the seven years (1856-1862) as averaging 26 sers per rupee, gram 29\u00bd, rice 23\u00bd. According to this return arhar, peas, and barley\u2014being 25, 26, and 22 sers per rupee respectively\u2014are the cheapest grains; the maizes are not as abundant or so cheap as in northern Oudh. Annual averages are however very deceptive. In 1873 for instance, the average price of arhar was 20\u00bd sers for the rupee, but during the last four months of the year it was about 15 sers, and there was considerable scarcity.\n\nThis return does not include the cheapest grains\u2014kodo, mindwa, and s\u00e1nw\u00e1n,\u2014the latter of which at any rate is very extensively grown in the district. The earliest fields of s\u00e1nw\u00e1n ripen about the 5th April, and from\nthat date the price unhulled averages about 43 sers. Kodo and mindwa average similar prices, and the poorer classes can generally get them from the middle of October to the middle of January; after that date they are not to be had in quantity, and the official quotations are merely nominal.\n\nThere is in fact a succession of harvests during the greater part of the year, and during the two months after being reaped each staple in its turn is very cheap\u2014kodo and mindwa are reaped about October 1st, Indian corn from September 15th to October 15th, the deorha rice about October 1st, bajra about November 1st, jarhan rice, and at the same time ju\u00e1r, about November 10th; these are cheap till the end of the year. In January and February there is no new grain in the market, and supplies are not eked out as in other districts by large crops of sugarcane which is then being cut. Peas come in by the 25th February being much earlier than in northern Oudh, barley by the 10th March, wheat by the 15th, arhar by the 25th, sanw\u00e1n about the 5th April to 1st May. Prices are thus kept low till July, and it is only in July, August, and September, that there is any considerable pressure upon the people.\n\n**Statement showing the details of produce and prices in

There is nothing noteworthy about Rae Bareli in this respect. Its communications are not so good as those of some other districts, having no railway and only 56 miles of water communication along its outer border. On the other hand, its masonry wells afford it a greater insurance against famine, its drainage is superior to that of other districts, it suffers comparatively less from floods, and its area of artificial irrigation being it is alleged so much as three-fourths of the whole, absolute famine ought to be almost unknown. Great scarcity from a deficiency of rainfall in October for the rice, and in January for the spring crops, is common enough. On the average in five years out of ten the rains in October and January are so scanty as to be of no practical value. The average rainfall is as we have seen 38 inches, about the same as Lucknow; the rains were specially deficient in 1864, 1868, and 1873. In these years the rainfall was respectively 22, 19, and 41 inches, but the distribution was bad, the September October rains were deficient, and the consequence was that in 1865, 1869, and 1874 there was very considerable scarcity, approaching to famine, in 1869. No special measures were called for, and the people were employed on the district roads. A brief abstract of the Rae Bareli famine and scarcities viewed historically is given compiled from official records:\n\nAll agree that there was a very severe drought and famine in 1784-85 A.D. In Partabgarh coarse grain sold at seven sers for the rupee; it lasted for nine months. Dr. Young says that this famine is often alluded to as the \"ak\u00e1l ch\u00e1l\u00edsa\" in allusion to its recurring every forty years. None of the reports show that any scarcity occurred in 1824, and so it can only be considered an odd coincidence that the saying is countenanced by the scarcity of 1864-65, when wheat flour sold in Partabgarh for eight, seven, and six sers for the rupee. There seem to have been seasons of scarcity in other years, as for instance in 1770 A.D. and in 1810 A.D., but no actual famine occurred comparable with that of 1784. In 1797 and 1816 frost greatly injured the crops. The rains were average in 1837, when famine attacked the North-Western Provinces. The Rae Bareli report states that there was a severe drought and famine in 1769-1770. The Sultanpur authorities mentioned the following prices as ruling in 1784, differing from those quoted above in Partabgarh.\n\n| Articles | Year |\n|----------|------|\n| Wheat    | 1856 | 1857 | 1858 | 1859 | 1860 | 1861 | 1862 | Average |\n| Gram     | 28   | 24   | 26   | 25   | 28   | 26\u00bd | 26   | 26     |\n| Rice     | 36   | 30   | 21   | 30\u00bd | 30\u00bd | 30   | 29   | 29\u00bd   |\n\nThe following have been the prices current in sers for rupee:\u2014\nIt appears from the above that the famine of 1861 did not affect Rae Bareli.\n\nFood.\u2014The food of the people is the same as that consumed throughout the rest of Oudh. Moth, or peas pottage, and barley bread, or cakes made of barley and gram mixed, form the ordinary bill of fare. There are generally two meals in the day, at noon and at sunset; but if the people are very poor, they content themselves with one meal at sunset and a little of what is left served up cold the next morning and called basi. S\u00e1nw\u00e1n and kodo are largely consumed in the rainy season. Rice and the maizes are less used than in northern and western Oudh. Three quarters of a ser is reckoned a meagre allowance, and arh\u00e1i p\u00e1o or ten chhat\u00e1ks a famine allowance of the grains above alluded to. This subject is dwelt upon at length in the Sitapur and Kheri articles.\n\nThe following are the average prices of food grains in Fatehpur, the adjoining district from 1830 to 1850, a period of 21 years:\n\n| Grain   | Price per rupee |\n|---------|-----------------|\n| Wheat   | 23 sers         |\n| Gram    | 31 \"            |\n| Barley  | 30 \"            |\n| Peas    | 33 \"            |\n\nIn 1837, the year of famine, the average price of barley was 24 sers.*\n\nFisheries.\u2014\"The Collector of Rae Bareli considers the destruction of all sorts of fish as considerable, the principal seasons for fishing being in the hot weather and during the rains. In the former the big fish are mostly trapped; during the latter the smaller fish are more extensively caught than at other seasons of the year. The smallest size of the mesh of nets employed is from a quarter to one-third of an inch. The difficulties in regulating the size of the mesh of nets consists in the natural dislike and prejudice of the rustic population against any innovation whatever in the implements for carrying on their craft, so he deprecates such and gives no opinion as to what size he considers advisable. The fry of fish, he observes, are not sold separately from the fish in this district, and therefore the prohibition of the sale of the fry would be superfluous. Large fish are sold at from three-fourths to one anna, small ones at one quarter to half an anna per ser.\"\u2014Para. 285, Francis Day's Fresh Water Fish and Fisheries of India and Burma.\n\nThe following is from the settlement report:\n\n\"Manufacture.\u2014Some years ago the idea that salt manufacture in Oudh could compete with the imported article prevailed sufficiently to induce the Imperial Government to sanction the experiment of opening legalized local works. The following statistics show how erroneous was the idea, how complete has been the failure. The manufacture of salt was commenced in this district in pargana Panhan\u2020 in March, 1870, and\n\n* \"Kinock's Statistics of District Fatehpur.\"\n\u2020 Now in Unao.\ncontinued to the end of the rainy season. The total quantity manufactured was maunds 24,983, of which were sold 23,666, destroyed by inundation 1,317. The sale of this salt took no less than sixteen months i.e., from April, 1870, to July, 1871, and it sold for very much less than its cost,\u2014in fact, a large quantity could only be cleared by letting it go on payment of the Government dues only, which here are Rs. 3-2-0 per maund, viz.:\n\n| Duty | Rs. |\n|------|-----|\n|      | 3 0 0 |\n| Cesses for cost of estate | 0 1 0 |\n| Landlord's royalty | 0 1 0 |\n\nTotal Government dues per maund | 3 2 0 |\n\n\"Its cost.\u2014Salt cannot be manufactured in this district at less than 12 annas per maund. In some part of the Delhi division superior salt can be produced for from two to three annas per maund; the cost of carriage and other incidental charges to Cawnpore being nine annas per maund. In the Rae Bareli bazars the following are at present the prevailing retail prices of salt per maund:\n\n| Kila (black) | Rs. a. p. |\n|--------------|-----------|\n|              | 13 5 4    |\n| Sambhar      | 8 14 3    |\n| Lohauri      | 8 0 0     |\n| Katila       | 6 2 6     |\n| Nuh (salambha) | 5 0 0   |\n| Gurari from 5 to | 5 11 5 |\n\n\"The fact that the local product did not fetch on the spot what its manufacture cost, over and above Rs. 3-2-0, and in some cases only Rs. 3-2-0 per maund, with such prices for the imported article prevailing in the bazars, shows how mistaken was the idea that occasioned this profitless endeavour; but it is to be hoped that this failure will put an end to lamentations about the destruction of a flourishing manufacture and the serious loss entailed thereby on landed proprietors.\n\n\"Trade.\u2014Of trade there is not much, of manufactures there are none, with the exception of the making of brass and copper utensils at Bhagwantnagar.*\n\nWeaving for local consumption is also carried on. A statement is given of the amount of the sales at the different bazars and fairs in the district, and further on a return of the amounts of salt and saltpetre said to have been manufactured during the native rule. Both these returns, however, must be received with caution, as they have been compiled from the statements of chaudhris and patwaris, and not from any systematically prepared returns.\"\n\n* Coarse

to Haidargarh, district Bara Banki, by Lalganj and Bachhr\u00e1w\u00e1n\u2014all in Rae Bareli district. This part of the principal road above named is 45 miles in length, and the stages are Lalganj, 12 miles from R\u00e1lpur, Gurbakhshganj 10 miles further, and Bachhr\u00e1w\u00e1n 14 miles. The rivers are Matra and Sai, both unbridged. There are four n\u00e1las on this road.\n\nB.\u2014Barh\u00e1mpur station, East Indian Railway, to Fyzabad.\u2014The part of this road lying within the Rae Bareli district is from Naubasta Gh\u00e1t, left bank of the Ganges to Haidargarh, district Bara Banki, by Salon, Jais, and Inhauna\u2014all in Rae Bareli district. Total length of this part of the road is 59 miles. The stages are Mustafabad in Partabgarh, 3 miles from Naubasta Gh\u00e1t, Umr\u00e1w\u00e1n 6 miles further, Salon 10 miles, Bichhw\u00e1ri 9 miles, Jais 11 miles, Mohanganj 9 miles, and Inhauna 11 miles. The Sai is the only river, and it is unbridged. There are five n\u00e1las.\n\nC.\u2014From Dus\u00fati, Rae Bareli, and Mohanganj road to Bachhr\u00e1w\u00e1n by Digbijaganj, district Rae Bareli.\u2014This road is 21 miles long, and the stages are Digbijaganj, 9 miles from Dus\u00fati, and Bachhr\u00e1w\u00e1n 12 miles further; rivers there are none, and n\u00e1la only one.\n\nD.\u2014From Allahabad to Cawnpore, North-Western Provinces, by Lalganj, Salon, and Bih\u00e1r.\u2014This road passes for 48 miles throughout this district, and the stages are Jagatpur, 12 miles from Allahabad, Dil\u00e1war 13 miles further, Lalganj 8 miles, and Bih\u00e1r in Partabgarh 15 miles. There is no river, but one n\u00e1la.\n\nE.\u2014From Fatehpur, East Indian Railway, to Fyzabad by Dalmau, Rae Bareli, and Haidargarh, district Bara Banki.\u2014This road passes for 50 miles throughout this district; the stages are Katgarh 9 miles from Dalmau, Rae Bareli 9 miles further, and Digbijaganj. The rivers are the Ganges, the Sai, and Naiya,\u2014all of which except the first are bridged. Communication is made over the first by a ferry.\n\nF.\u2014From Allahabad to Lucknow by Salon and Rae Bareli.\u2014This road passes for 52 miles throughout this district; the stages are Salon, 13 miles from last stage in Partabgarh district, New\u00e1da, Karauli 10 miles further, Rae Bareli 9 miles, Harchandpur 10 miles, and Bachhr\u00e1w\u00e1n 10 miles. The Sai is the only river, and it is bridged. There are six n\u00e1las on this road.\n\nG.\u2014From Fatehpur, East Indian Railway, to Fyzabad by Lalganj, Rae Bareli, and Mohanganj.\u2014This road passes for 38 miles throughout this district and the following are the stages\u2014Itaura 10 miles from Lalganj, Rae Bareli 9 miles further, Dus\u00fati 10 miles, and Mohanganj 9 miles. The Sai is the only river, and it is bridged. There is only one n\u00e1la.\nH.\u2014From Rae Bareli to Sultanpur.\u2014This passes for 20 miles throughout this district, and the stages are Fursatganj 11 miles, and Jais 9 miles.\n\nK.\u2014From Allahabad to Rae Bareli by Manikpur, Mustafabad, and Jagatpur.\u2014This road passes for 34 miles throughout this district. The stages are Jagatpur, 11 miles from Mustafabad, last stage in Partabgarh district, and Rae Bareli 11 miles further. The river is the Sai here (bridged.)\n\nL.\u2014From Rae Bareli to Cawnpore by Gurbakhshganj and Bihar.\u2014This road passes for 30 miles throughout this district, and the stage is only Gurbakhshganj, 15 miles from Rae Bareli.\n\nLocal measures.\u2014There is nothing worthy of note about these. The local paseri of five for two sers is current in this district. In Dalmau a local ser larger than the imperial ser has been current for generations. This consists of sixteen gandas, each ganda being four Maddu Sahi pice; each of these weighs 270 grains, and the weight of the ser will be consequently 17,280 grains, the Government ser being 14,400 grains. Since annexation, however, the baniyas in some places have reduced the weight of the ser to fourteen gandas; this will come to 15,120 grains, or exactly one British Indian ser and four tolas. The Shahjahapur bigha of 4,025 square yards is everywhere used, but local bighas bearing no proportion to it, supposed to be based on the same unit of measurement, are also used collaterally. The measures of length and capacity are common to Oudh.\nCHAPTER III.\n\nTHE PEOPLE.\n\nThe people, their castes\u2014Table of area and population\u2014Religion\u2014Fairs\u2014Urban population\u2014Condition of the people\u2014Tenures\u2014List of taluqdars\u2014Table exhibiting tribal distribution of property\u2014Extracts from the settlement report regarding proprietary possessions.\n\nThe people: their castes.\u2014Rae Bareli is essentially a rural and a Hindu district. The population is mainly agricultural; there are hardly any manufactures except a little glass at Dalmau, coarse cloth at Jais, and such matters. The culture of the earth is the main stay of the people.\n\nThe Brahmans are the most numerous caste; they number 128,575. Then come the Ahirs 115,534, the Chamars 81,853, the Chhattris 73,320. Compared to the average of Oudh districts the proportion of high caste is larger than usual. Nor is this unaccountable. Rae Bareli has been for centuries the seat of a Hindu authority, but little controlled by the Musalman Lord Paramount. The peculiarities of its land tenure thence arising will be afterwards considered, here it may only be remarked that Chhattris and Brahmans naturally crowded to a country practically governed by their co-religionists.\n\nThe following table shows the population and area of the district in detail:\n\n**District Rae Bareli, Area and Population.**\n\n| Pargana | Area in square Bri-tish statute miles | Population |\n|---------|--------------------------------------|------------|\n|         | No. of townships | Total | Cultivat-ed | Hindus | Mahommedan | Males | Females | Total | No. of persons to each square mile |\n| Delmau  | ...               | 292   | 253        | 121    | 138,767   | 6,831 | 72,185  | 72,958 | 145,068 |\n| Sareni  | ...               | 169   | 114        | 61     | 64,021    | 1,208 | 33,027  | 33,820 | 65,259  |\n| Khiron  | ...               | 128   | 103        | 56     | 56,366    | 1,918 | 32,091  | 33,193 | 59,354  |\n| Total   | ...               | 584   | 469        | 238    | 259,144   | 9,457 | 133,258 | 135,848| 268,601 |\n| Rae Bareli | ...            | 863   | 371        | 201    | 199,564   | 12,969| 106,117 | 106,416| 212,533 |\n| Total   | ...               | 863   | 371        | 201    | 199,564   | 12,969| 106,117 | 106,416| 212,533 |\n| Inhauna | ...               | 77    | 100        | 44     | 48,841    | 6,678 | 28,389  | 29,237 | 57,519  |\n| Bachhr\u00e1wan | ...          | 58    | 94         | 49     | 48,090    | 2,777 | 25,507  | 25,360 | 50,867  |\n| Kumhr\u00e1wan | ...           | 58    | 70         | 32     | 38,474    | 859   | 19,995  | 19,840 | 39,339  |\n| Hardoi  | ...               | 23    | 24         | 11     | 14,968    | 743   | 7,808   | 7,898  | 15,706  |\n| Simrauta| ...               | 73    | 97         | 46     | 56,841    | 1,980 | 29,611  | 29,260 | 58,771  |\n| Mohanganj | ...            | 75    | 80         | 39     | 42,950    | 4,831 | 25,475  | 25,806 | 47,381  |\n| Total   | ...               | 384   | 465        | 219    | 250,159   | 19,318| 134,576 | 134,901| 269,477 |\n\n---\n\nRAE\n### Area and Population (concluded).\n\n| Pargana | No. of townships | Total | Cultivated | Hindus | Mahomedans | Males | Females | Total | No. of persons to each square mile |\n|---------|------------------|-------|------------|--------|------------|-------|---------|------|-----------------------------------|\n| Salon   | 387              | 236   | 110        | 109,680| 10,915     | 60,220| 60,385  | 130,545| 533                               |\n| Parab\u00e1depur | 60            | 54    | 38         | 30,851 | 2,186      | 16,625| 16,412  | 33,037 | 612                               |\n| Rokha Jais | 110            | 154   | 71         | 70,582 | 13,861     | 43,289| 42,204  | 84,443 | 548                               |\n| **Total** | **457**         | **434**| **309**    | **211,063**| **26,962**| **119,084**| **118,941**| **338,025**| **548**                           |\n| **Grand Total** | **1768**       | **1789**| **867**    | **916,980**| **68,706**| **493,030**| **495,806**| **989,636**| **548**                           |\n\n**Europeans** | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n**Eurasians** | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n**Prisoners and employees in jail** | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\n**Note.\u2014This is taken from the census report and differs but slightly from later calculations which make the total population 986,719, and the total area 1,747 square miles.**\n\nThe Hindu religion has no special developments in Rae Bareli.

A table is given showing the principal festivals and fairs\u2014all of which have a religious origin.

Kakor was it is alleged the brother of D\u00e1l, the Bhar king of Dalmau, who incurred the wrath of the Sharqi sovereign of Jaunpur by demanding the daughter of a Musalman in marriage. It is worthy of inquiry whether this festival is a mere instance of hero worship, or whether Kakor represents some aboriginal divinity. According to the table this Bhar prince is the only eponymous personage whose celebration attract any crowds. A clan called Bharotia, said to be a sept of the Ah\u00edr, continues to pour oblations of milk on the tombs of the Bhar chiefs, B\u00e1l and D\u00e1l, at Bareli and Dalmau, and the women of the clan in mourning for these ancient chiefs still refuse to wear the common lac bracelets which are the usual ornaments of the sex.\n\nUrban population.\u2014The Urban population is very small; there are only four towns, with a population of above 5,000.\n\n| Town          | Population |\n|---------------|------------|\n| Rae Bareli    | 7,092      |\n| Ikhtiy\u00e1rpur   | 5,003      |\n| Dalmau        | 5,654      |\n| Salon         | 5,190      |\n| J\u00e1s           | 11,689     |\n\nA town called Kunsa entered in the census tables as having a population of 5,864 is merely a collection of separate villages thrown together in the Government revenue records. The urban population is therefore 8\u00b75 per cent. Besides the above there are 58 large villages, with a population of from 2,000 to 5,000.\n\nThe following is from the settlement report:\n\nCondition of the people.\u2014The low caste cultivators are very poorly off. They live almost entirely on the inferior grains of the khar\u00edf crop, the more valuable rabi going to pay the mah\u00e1jan, for nearly the whole of this class come under advances to the village mah\u00e1jan both for their food and their seed, and make over the crop to him. They enjoy only a bare subsistence, for the usual rate of interest demanded is 50 per cent. at the harvest. Last year, 1870, grain being exceptionally high at the time of rabi sowing as the year before had been one of short crop, the mah\u00e1jans refused to advance seed on the usual terms; and they were arranged on the basis that the cultivator was to pay back at the harvest one and a half times as much grain as the then market price of the seed furnished would buy when the harvest was reaped.\n\nWith all this these people are as improvident as their betters, and when a plentiful harvest puts something in their pockets, they spend it at once in a marriage or something of the kind.\n\nSince 1871 in the spring of which year the hail caused so much damage, the seasons have been most indifferent for the small cultivator, who is now more or less reduced to poverty. This year's spring crops, however, have somewhat strengthened his position, and owing to the good prices realized at the harvest time have improved his condition. To the above cause must also be added a fair mahua crop and an abundant mango crop.\n\n* See article Dalmau\nBesides bad seasons the cultivator has for the past five years suffered much from cattle disease, which annually visits some part or other of the district. Cattle disease is just now raging in the villages on the Sai. No precautions are taken against the disease; about a third of the cattle attacked escaped. In 1874, land which had been fallow for two or three years has been again brought under cultivation. Sugarcane and garden crops are on the increase, but wheat does not seem to be ousting barley or peas; jarhan dh\u00e1n is more extensively grown of late years. Poppy and jethwa s\u00e1w\u00e1n are much more extensively cultivated, and the custom is spreading of transplanting the makra or mindwa crop instead of sowing it. This custom ensures a more plentiful and a much earlier crop, but it is dependent on well irrigation till the rains commence.\n\nThe rate of interest in the district is nominally 24 per cent. per annum, but the poorer cultivators pay considerably more. Mortgages of groves, sir lands, and of shares in pattidari villages are very common, but sales are not so. Interest I think had a tendency to fall some years ago, but the hard times have caused it to rise again.\n\nI regret to be obliged to state that nearly every as\u00e1mi, who within the last six years has constructed a pakka well in my neighbourhood, has been ruined or next to ruined.\n\nWith reference to weaving, I am informed that the weaving of finer cloths, which were formerly in great demand, has almost entirely stopped, but the coarser cloths are still manufactured as generally as formerly, not only for the local markets but also for exports. This industry, however, is I think, doomed, especially now that English cloths are becoming so common and so cheap, and are being so generally used at the dye factories.\n\nWithin the last four or five years the price of plough-bullocks has risen about 75 per cent., there is however no scarcity of bullocks, for the cattle bazars continue well supplied, but owing to the high prices, the mah\u00e1jans ruinous interest, and the frequent recurrence of the cattle disease, cultivators possess very inferior draught animals, which, with hard work and insufficient fodder, are not likely to improve in their hands.\n\nTenures.\u2014It is impossible to do more than to indicate the features of property in this district, for the settlement and census report, which are the main sources of information, concerned themselves solely with the old district which differs entirely from the new one. Of the 1,350 square miles in the old district 422 have been taken away, and 711 square miles of new territory have been added. Still the main features of the tenures have not been much altered, the district remains taluqdari, although the Kanhpuria clan owns a much larger portion of the new than of the old territory. There are altogether about 1,198 villages covering 1,279 square miles, the property of 100 large owners, and 537 villages covering 460 square miles, the property of about 11,000 small proprietors, mostly Bais and Kanhpurias.\n\nThe proprietary rights in the district of Rae Bareli are very interesting from a historical as well as economical point of view. Out of 1,735\nvillages in the present district, no less than 1,719 are owned by Tilokchandi Bais, viz., those of the Bais clan who are descended from the great chief Tilok Chand, who died shortly before B\u00e1bar ascended the throne of Delhi. As an historical and social fact it is strange to a degree. The immobility and stability of the Hindu system is remarkably proved by the fact that for hundreds of years this Bais and other Chhattri clans who number 75,000 in Rae Bareli, men of the sword, too, have contentedly submitted to be ruled by about forty chiefs whose position was in itself a usurpation upon the throne, and against whom at any time the masses would have been aided to rebel by royal officers. The position of these chiefs was so assured that they have throughout treated their brethren with contumely, refusing to eat with them: because they could not boast of an ancestor who had once exercised regal or semi-regal authority.\n\nThe great proprietary clans now are the Bais in the west holding parganas Dalmau, Rae Bareli, Sareni, Khiron, Hardoi and others, and the Kanhpuria to the east who hold Salon, Rokha Jais, Parsh\u00e1depur, Mohanganj, Simrauta.\n\nFurther, the proprietors are mostly taluqdars; 1,198 villages belong to taluqdars and 537 to smaller proprietors. Among the latter there is an extreme subdivision; great numbers of them, even two-thirds of the entire number possess on the average only ten acres of land each. On the other hand, eleven men have among them 350,000 acres, and 816,000 acres, or two-thirds of the district, are held in 62 great estates owned by 100 chiefs. A list of the great estates is given.

taluqdars.\u2014Out of the total number of villages of this district amounting to 1,482, there belong to taluqdars 1,029.\n\n\"Of these latter there have been decreed in sub-settlement\u2014\n\nEntire villages ... :: :: :: :: :: :: 56\n\nPortions of villages :: :: :: :: :: :: 8\n\n\"And there have been given on a farming tenure 12, viz.:\n\n3 at a ten per cent. and less share of the gross assets.\n5 at fourteen to twenty per cent. and less share of the gross assets.\n4 at over twenty per cent. and less share of the gross assets.\"\n\"The gross assets of the estates of taluqdars have been estimated at Rs. 15,71,191, and of the portion decreed away from them as above Rs. 1,09,417.\n\nOf which sam Government takes ... ... ... ... 55,893\nThe taluqdars take ... ... ... ... 26,477\nThe old proprietors take ... ... ... ... 27,547\n\nTotal ... 109,417\n\n\"Eleven hundred and forty-four persons are recorded as holding shares in these assets, which gives an average of Rs. 24 per annum for each recorded shareholder. In other words, the share of the assumed profits of their own villages absorbed by the old proprietors holding on a sub-settlement tenure and on farming leases is 50\u00b741 per cent. to a share of 49\u00b759 per cent. awarded to taluqdars.\n\n\"Altogether 10,623 claims to subordinate rights, excluding sub-settlement of all kinds in taluqas, have been preferred in this district, of which 4,678 related to sir and n\u00e1nkar.\n\n331 \" to shankalp.\n5,619 \" to all other claims.\n\n\"Of these three hundred and thirty-one claims to shankalp, 161 were decreed.\n\n\"Shankalp kushast is a pure mu\u00e1fi tenure given by taluqdars, and therefore liable to resumption by them at regular settlement. Grants by shankalp were probably in existence long before the word taluqdar was invented.\n\n\"Original shankalp.\u2014They were originally grants of land, money or property of any kind, made to Brahmans of esteemed holiness by pious or superstitious persons. A ceremony has to be gone through which is called kushast, from the fact of grass being placed on the grantee's hand during it, and a formula was repeated from which the grant took its name of shankalp.\n\n\"Enormity of resuming a shankalp.\u2014To resume a grant of shankalp is by the Hindu religion, the deadliest of sins; and is visited by transformation in a future state into a worm in the nethermost Hindu hell, the nearest approach to which state of existence is in this world, the life of a maggot in an unclean place whatever that may be like. The natives have a story of a r\u00e1ja who in knocking down some mud buildings, to clear a site on which to build a place, was on the point of destroying the nest of a bird, which was endeavouring to rear some young ones, and who in the agony of her despair, threatened to drop one grain from out of some grant of shankalp made by the r\u00e1ja into his food, to the end, that by eating it he might commit the unpardonable sin. It is to be hoped that the r\u00e1ja spared the nest, and escaped the punishment.\n\n\"Of the 5,619 other claims, which include claims to groves, grazing lands, jungles, waste, wells, village sites and proprietary dues, 3,466 were admitted and 2,153 were dismissed or withdrawn.\"\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nADMINISTRATION.\n\nAdministration\u2014Thanas\u2014Police\u2014Crimes\u2014Accidental deaths\u2014Revenue and expenditure\u2014Education\u2014Post-offices.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The administration is in the hands of a deputy commissioner, aided by one or more assistant commissioners, three or four Native or European extra assistant commissioners, four tahsildars, and seven honorary magistrates. The arrangements of the police stations, the strength and cost of the police are given in the following tables,\u2014another exhibits the increase of crime and of their duties during the last five years, and a third shows the accidental deaths and suicides. The number of both these in 1871 is unusually large, the season was one of heavy rain and consequent floods, many people were drowned, others crushed by falling walls.\n\nStatement showing the

revenue of 1872-1873 is shown in the following table; it will appear that the land revenue constitutes 89 per cent. of the whole, and the landowners pay four-fifths of the income-tax besides. The income tax is no longer collected. In 1873 it was assessed upon 306 persons and yielded Rs. 15,452; of these 163 were landowners, and paid 12,517 or above four-fifths. Eleven lawyers paid income-tax and 118 money-lenders, while nine persons paying Rs. 105 represented the wealth acquired by trade and manufactures among nearly a million of people. The expenditure does not call for comment; it amounts to Rs. 1,61,038 or 12 per\ncent. of the revenue, but both sums leave out of account large receipts and expenditure on account of police, education, and local works:\n\n### Revenue.\n\n| Description                                      | 1871   | 1872   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| 1.

The fact that all the coins belong to the same series makes it nearly certain that the date of their consignment to the receptacle from which they have just been delivered was between 17 and 18 centuries ago. The names Kadphises and Kanerki, the title Rao Nana Rao, and the Mithraic words \"Okro\" and \"Athro\" are distinctly legible; there are other inscriptions which might be explained by an experienced numismatologist.\n\nMr. Capper discovered some very fine gold coins of the Skanda Gupta series at Baksar; and besides these the irregularly shaped bits of silver with devices stamped one over the other, and apparently at different times, which were the coin of an unknown period of antiquity, are not uncommon.\n\nFrom this it may be inferred that some kind of civilization existed in this district from very early times down to at least the end of the third century A.D., and it is no wild conjecture that the desolation which we discover when its modern history commences was due to the exterminating wars which marked the revival of Brahmanism.\n\nThe first piece of local history is connected with Dalmau which appears to have been a flourishing town from early times. On a hill to the north-west of the fort is still shown the tomb of a Muhammadan martyr Badrud-din, whose traditional date is 646 H., (1248 A.D.) From an old Hindi story-book which professes to have been copied in 1043 H., from an original composed in 779 H. (1587 A.D.), we learn that Jauna Shah,\u2020 the lieutenant of the Emperor Firoz, had stopped at Dalmau on his way to what was to become Jaunpur, and had beautified the city. It is further stated that Malik Mubarak was the Governor, and that there was a considerable colony of Musalmans, besides a settlement of Chauhans and Sunars. Malik Mubarak's name is still held in great reverence at Dalmau, and his tomb is shown in the fort. The kings of Oudh used to allow a small monthly stipend for the purpose of keeping a light burning on it, and the government officials when they arrived at the town were expected to pay it a visit before they proceeded to their work. From this it may be inferred that he was the founder of the Musalman settlement, and that before the time of Jauna Shah the town had been entirely Hindu.\n\nTowards the end of the fourteenth century the town was in danger from the neighbouring Bhars, who, under the rule of four brothers, had\n\n* The greater part of the historical portion of this chapter is from Mr. Benett's \"Clans of Rae Barcli.\"\n\u2020 Jauna Shah preceded Firoz on the throne of Delhi.\nestablished something like an organized government over the Bareli and Dalmau parganas.\n\nD\u00e1l and B\u00e1\u00ed had forts at Dalmau and Rae Bareli, while two less famous brothers, Kap\u00far and Bh\u00e1wan, were settled at Sud\u00e1m\u00e1npur. It is said that D\u00e1l offered violence to the daughter of a Dalmau Sayyad, and the complaints of the insulted father brought Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Sharqi from Jaunpur to avenge the indignity. It is at any rate certain that this king fought a great battle with the Bharas at Sud\u00e1m\u00e1npur, and drove them before him into the Dalmau fort, where after a stubborn defence their whole army was destroyed. The tomb of the Bhar chieftains is still shown at Pakrauli, rather more than a mile from Dalmau, and is celebrated by a fair in the autumn, at which great numbers of Ahirs collect, and offer milk to the souls of the departed heroes. The women of the Bharotia Gotr of Ahirs do not wear anklets, saying that they are still mourning for their kings.\n\nThis success at Dalmau was only part of a regular Musalman conquest of the whole district. In 796 H. (1394 A.D.), Khw\u00e1ja Jah\u00e1n, the Subahdar of Kanauj, Oudh, Karra and Jaunpur had asserted his independence, and his successor on the throne of Jaunpur, Shams-ud-d\u00edn Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Shah Sharqi, applied himself to consolidate his power over the subject provinces. Already he had established his rule at Salon, Parsh\u00e1depur, J\u00e1\u00eds, M\u00e1nikpur, and other places, building, says tradition, 52 forts in one day.\n\nSalon is said to derive its name from S\u00e1l B\u00e1han, who relieved the country from the presence of a demon called Sahasr B\u00e1han, and founded the town.\n\nParsh\u00e1depur is said to be called after Paras R\u00e1m, the Oudh incarnation of Vishnu, but etymologically it is much more likely that R\u00e1ja Parsh\u00e1d Singh, the great Kanhpuria, who subdued this neighbourhood in Tilok Chand's time, gave his name to an older town. Near it is the village of Ranki, the traditional seat of the Government of * R\u00e1ja Bhartari*, elder brother of Bikramajit. This unfortunate prince was cheated by his brother out of a magic fish, the digestion of which gave the knowledge of all things that occurred in the three worlds. He dissembled his disappointment, and retired to the distant solitudes of Oudh where he founded the city of Ranki.\n\nThe present inhabitants say that Ranki is the Bhar name for a wine-seller, and that they have occasionally found in their village gold coins, chains, and articles of domestic use, which have been exposed by the rainy season; they were, however, unable or unwilling to show me any of these relics. The ruins themselves are sufficiently remarkable. A sea of bricks represents what must have once been a large town, in the midst of which high grass-grown mounds preserve the sites of lofty mansions. To the south-west of the town there is a large oblong fortress measuring about 250 yards in one direction, by 150 in the other, and surrounded by a moat some 30 yards wide.\n\nThe old name of J\u00e1\u00eds was Uj\u00e1lknagar, and it was the seat of a Bhar kingdom. The irregular appearance of the town is attributed to the caprice of its Bhar monarch, who in constantly recurring fits of drunkenness had a\n\n* This raja is also connected with the Bhitari L\u00e1t on the Gumti, and the tradition in the text is peculiarly valuable.\nmethodical madness for raising fortifications. M\u00e1nikpur was named after M\u00e1nik Chand,* the great Gahrw\u00e1r r\u0101ja, who reigned from that town. It is said that he fell at the hands of Shah\u00e1b-ud-d\u00edn Gardezi,\u2020 the lieutenant of Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Sharqi. A part of the remnants of his family fled to Salon, of which town their descendants are at present part proprietors.\n\nAfter his success at Dalmau the Shah marched on Rae Bareli, which like the towns just mentioned was at that time a Bhar village clustered round a large fort. The traditions of the T\u00e1r Bir demon, and the monstrous well whose overflowing threatened to swamp the town have already been told. It is singular that traces of buffalo sacrifice, which must have descended from the Bhar times existed in connection with this fort up to annexation. When a Muhammadan n\u00e1zim came he sacrificed the buffalo; a Hirdu contented himself with slitting its ear.\n\nThe next enemy met by the Muhammadans was the Bais colony in the south-west of the district, and it is necessary that I should stop to give an account of that remarkable family.\n\nTheir early history is involved in much obscurity, and for the sake of clearness I will here leave all other families than the Tilokchandi Bais out of consideration. The story of the birth and life of Sal B\u00e1han, the son of the world serpent, and their first ancestor, has all the appearance of being a genuine tradition, in spite of the monstrous and indecent Brahmanical traditions with which it has been overlaid; and it agrees well with probable historical conjecture that this prince was one of the Takshak or Scythian dynasty, who were known as n\u00e1gas or snakes by their Arian subjects\u2014a conjecture which is further confirmed by the fact that the serpent is the tribe deity of his descendants at the present day.\n\nThe original tradition, as far as I have been able to extract it from the various accounts which I have heard, is as follows:\u2014A son of the great world serpent was brought up under the roof of a potter of M\u00fangi P\u00e1tan on the Nerbudda, and early showed by his wit and strength that he was destined to be a king. As a judge among his youthful companions, by what would now be considered a simple process of cross examination, he excited the wonder of a people unaccustomed to law courts; and deserved and received the same kind of honour as was accorded to Daniel by the Jews of the captivity after his successful investigation of the case of Susanna and the elders. His amusement was to make clay figures of elephants, horses, and men at arms, and before he had well reached manhood he led his fictile army to do battle with the great king Bikramaj\u00edt. When the hosts met, the clay of the young hero became living brass, and the weapons of his enemies fell harmless on the hard material.\n\n* M\u00e1nik Chand as well as D\u00e1l and B\u00e1\u00ed, the Bhar chieftains, are constantly appearing at any time within the years 1000 and 1400 A.D., and have successfully eluded all my efforts to saddle them with a date. I think it probable that M\u00e1nik Chand and possible that D\u00e1l and B\u00e1\u00ed lived near the beginning of the thirteenth century.\n\n\u2020 In Shekh Ahmad's history of the Sayyeds of India, it is stated that Shah\u00e1b-ud-d\u00edn Gardezi settled at M\u00e1nikpur in the reign of Qutb-ud-d\u00edn-bin-Altamah. At M\u00e1nikpur they suppose two Shah\u00e1b-ud-d\u00edns, one of the 18th century and another, father of Sharf-ud-d\u00edn, Q\u00e1zi-ul-Quzz\u00e1t in Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Sultan's time. Like all the Muhammadan families of Rae Bareli and Partabgarh, they have no trustworthy pedigree.\nBikramajit fled, and took refuge in a large shiw\u00e1la whither he was pursued by S\u00e1l B\u00e1han. At the mere sound of the boy's voice the ponderous gates of the temple rolled back, and Bikramajit acknowledged his conqueror with appropriate homage. A reasonable arrangement was made on the spot for the partition of the royal power, and on the elder king's death, S\u00e1l B\u00e1han became undisputed R\u00e1ja of India. Later in life he conquered the Punjab, and died and was buried at Si\u00falkot.\n\nOf the history of his descendants till the time of the invasion of Oudh by Abhai Chand nothing is positively known. The R\u00e9j Tarangini relates that a Bais general usurped the throne of Delhi at the beginning of the seventh century, A.D.\n\nTwo different pedigrees connect Tilok Chand with S\u00e1l B\u00e1han,\u2014one giving 42 generations with Abhai Chand at the fourteenth, the other 31, with Abhai Chand at the twenty-second. Twenty names are common to both lists which are sufficiently unlike to prove separate sources, and sufficiently like to show a common historical ground-work. Both where they corroborate and where they contradict one another they are equally interesting and unintelligible.\n\nThe supporters of the longer list state that in Bhagwant R\u00e1e's time the kingdom was divided between his three sons, one of whom got Oudh. I may hazard a conjecture that this is a historical tradition on the following grounds.\u2014The first name common to the two lists is Ghuk Kum\u00e1r, who in the longer list is represented as the father of the above named Bhagwant R\u00e1e, and below him the number of generations and the names, though in a different order, are almost identical in both lists. This is sufficient to make it very probable that Ghuk Kum\u00e1r's reign was an epoch in Bais history, and the division of the kingdom in his son's reign affords an excellent explanation. It is likely that the story refers to a forced change of abode before a victorious enemy, or a ver sacrum, by which an overcrowded home was relieved of some of the younger and more vigorous offshoots.\n\nThe coincidence of the pedigrees makes it reasonable to suppose that this took place thirty generations before the time of Tilok Chand, in the eighth century, A.D. Between Abhai Chand and Tilok Chand the shorter list is undoubtedly in the main correct; and the extraordinary divergences between the two are amply accounted for by the violent vicissitudes of fortune which marked Bais history in the reigns of R\u00e1e T\u00e1s and his two successors.\n\nTwelve centuries after the death of S\u00e1l B\u00e1han two gallant youths who boasted that they were of his race found themselves and their followers at a bathing place on the Ganges when an affray arose between some soldiers of the Gautam r\u00e1ja of \u00c1rgal and the forces of the Subahdar. The Hindus were defending the honour of their queen and her daughter from the lust of the Musalmans, and no Rajput could turn a deaf ear to the agonized appeals for help that issued from the lady's bullock cart. So the Bais joined the losing side of their countrymen, rallied the fugitives, and beat off the Muhammadans, but left one of their princes dead on the\nfield. The survivor, Abhai Chand, escorted the rescued queen back to Argal. It was only natural that the young princess should fall in love with the soldier who had been wounded in her defence, and the king of Argal was himself in a position which made him very glad to secure the services of such a son-in-law. In the eastern part of his dominions was a large tract of country over which he exercised only a nominal authority, and which was thinly populated by a fierce intractable people called the Bhars, who paid him neither tribute nor respect. So he gave his daughter to Abhai Chand, and with her the vice-royalty of this unprofitable province.*\n\nWhatever may be the value of this story, there can be no doubt that at about this time there was a very general advance of Hindus into this district. The Kanhpurias\u2020 at the eastern, and the Bais at the south-western corner, as well as several old zamindari families, such as the P\u00e1ndes of Shiun\u00e1m, are proved by the coincidence of their pedigrees to have settled nearly contemporaneously in the seats where they are now found; and it is clear that they were portions of one wave of Hindu emigration.\n\nThe greater part of this district was then covered with extensive forest, and in the clear spaces the few brick huts and scattered hamlets of the Bhars were the only evidences of human life. The nationality and religion of this people is a favourite topic for disquisition, and my truncated investigations have just so far enlightened me as to make me refrain from forming any opinion as to who or whence they were.\n\nA bad time was beginning for them now. Abhai Chand lost no time in proceeding to his newly gained dominions, and crossing the Ganges built a fort at Baksar as a basis of operations. His enemy was, however, too powerful for him, and he had to give up his position and retire to Abhaipur, the village he had founded in the Antarbed, where he died. His successor, Karan R\u00e1e, prosecuted his enterprise and again occupied Baksar, but the first real success was obtained by his grandson Siddh\u00fa R\u00e1e, who utterly routed the Bhars in a great battle, the memory of which is preserved in the name of the village Sangr\u00e1mpur, which he founded on the scene of his victory. Pushing on through the wooded ravines, and driving his enemy before him, he took possession of Mur\u00e1rmau and Daundia Khera, since famous as the seats of the two greatest of the Bais families, and was the first to establish his clan in the new country. His descendants continued to extend their dominion, and when in the fifth generation from him, and at the time of the Jaunpur invasion, R\u00e1e T\u00e1s succeeded to the chieftainship, he was the acknowledged ruler of the seven and a half small parganas which form the kernel of Baisw\u00e1ra.\u2021\n\nWhether this chieftain resisted and was defeated, or yielded without striking a blow to the vastly superior forces of the Muhammadans, I have been unable to discover; but we find him with his family and retainers\n\n* At the present day a Bais considers a marriage with a Gautam peculiarly lucky.\n\u2020 If, indeed, the Kanhpurias immigrated at all.\n\u2021 These were \u00danchi\u00f3n, Siddh\u00fapur, now Daundia Khera.\nBara, Kambhi, half Bhagwantnagar, now Bhagwantnagar.\nGh\u00e1tampur, Mag\u00e1yar, Panhan.\nshortly afterwards at the Court of the Chauh\u00e1n R\u00e1ja of Mainpuri. Many stories are connected with their exile, of which perhaps the most striking is that which accounts for the assumption of the title of r\u00e1ja by R\u00e1e T\u00e1s. It is said that Sumer S\u00e1h,* the Chauh\u00e1n, ridiculed the lately established family of the Bais, and refused their chief the honours paid to an equal. On this R\u00e1e T\u00e1s challenged him to a pitched battle. On the morning of the fight all the Bais youths less than 20 years old, to the number of about 500, were directed to return to their home, and in the event of the defeat of their elders preserve their family from extinction. With a modified obedience, and a happy compromise between prudence and valour, they withdrew to an eminence at such a distance from the engagement that they would be able to participate in the success or get a good start in case of the defeat of their relations. They watched an indecisive conflict from morning till evening, and then, taking advantage of the fatigue of both parties, swooped down on the Chauh\u00e1ns and secured the victory. In consequence of this Sumer S\u00e1h formally invested R\u00e1e T\u00e1s with the r\u00e1ja's tilak, and gave him his daughter in marriage. The Bais is said to have entered the army of the Delhi emperor, and to have served with distinction, and most accounts represent that he died fighting under his standard against some rebellious chieftain.\n\nHis son, R\u00e1ja Satna, successfully invaded the territories of the Sharqi Sultan. Having re-occupied his ancestral dominions, and acquired the new territory of Kh\u00edron from the Bhars, he pushed his conquests to the north, and taking advantage of the unsettled state of the Jaunpur empire, occupied the strong fort of K\u00e1kori after a severe contest with the Musalman colonists. His success was the signal for a general rising against the hated conquerors.\n\nFrom Safipur and K\u00e1kori to Salon and M\u00e1nikpur, the Az\u00e1n and the slaughter of kine were proscribed, and in most of the larger towns the new Muhammadan judges and tax collectors were murdered or driven away. At Salon, Sayyad Ma\u00fad, the ancestor of the present q\u00e1z\u00eds of that town, was cut down at his prayers by the neighbouring r\u00e1ja, who was most probably an ancestor of the Kanhpurias. His younger son was taken alive and kept in captivity by the Bhars. After a few years' imprisonment he made his escape to the court of the Jaunpur emperor. Even at M\u00e1nikpur, Az\u00edz-ud-d\u00edn and Sharf-ud-d\u00edn Gardezi,+ who had been left in charge of the town, were obliged to fly to the opposite stronghold of Karra. Husen Shah on his accession to the throne immediately sent a force from Karra to retrieve these losses. He had no difficulty in restoring the q\u00e1z\u00eds to the principal towns from which they had been ejected, but met with a stout resistance from R\u00e1ja Satna before the fortress at K\u00e1kori. It was taken at length by force or by fraud, and the r\u00e1ja was killed. Some accounts say that he was bricked up in the wall alive, and others that he was decapitated, and his head buried where the Shekhan Darw\u00e1za now stands at Lucknow. The brave R\u00e1na Beni M\u00e1dh\u00f3 Bakhsh, whose estate was confiscated for mutiny, swore to recover the head of his ancestor, but his oath was unfulfilled.\n\n* It is not however probable that Sumer S\u00e1h was then the reigning r\u00e1ja.\n\u2020 The sons of Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b-ud-d\u00edn, the founder of the family.\nThe r\u0101ni escaped, and on her flight to the Ganges was delivered of a son at the small village of Kotbhar on the confines of the Rae Bareli and Una districts. This posthumous son was afterwards famous as Tilok Chand, the eponymous hero of the greatest of the Bais clans, the father or the founder of many castes of Rajputs, and to the present day no Bais passes the place of his birth without showing his respect by dismounting from his horse and going by barefooted. His mother arrived safely at Mainpuri, and the young chieftain passed the first twenty years of his life at the refuge which had sheltered his father and grandfather. In 1478 A.D., the opportunity arrived which was to enable him to humble his ancestral enemies and to put him in possession of far more than his ancestral property.\n\nBahlool Lodi had sent an expedition against Husen Shah of Jaunpur, which resulted in the defeat of the latter, and his exile to the Court of Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn of Bengal, and Tilok Chand took this opportunity to lead a large force of Rajputs from Mainpuri into Oudh.* Following the steps of his father, he crossed the Ganges near Baksar, and marching northwards defeated the Musalmans who garrisoned K\u00e1kori. His further advance in that direction was checked by the Path\u00e1ns of Malihabad, and he had to be contented with K\u00e1kori as the northern limit of his r\u00e1j.\n\nAs his rule is the commencement of a new chapter in the history of the district, its consideration must be postponed for a short sketch of what had occurred in the northern and north-western parganas.\n\nAs has been already mentioned, several families of Hindu zamindars settled in these parts when Abhai Chand made his first attempt at occupation in the south. Of these by far the most important were the P\u00e1ndes of Shiun\u00e1m, the founder of whose family, Baram Datt P\u00e1nde, like Abhai Chand, fought under the auspices of Gautam government, and like him, too, lived 24 generations ago. The next settlers, the Muhammadans of Bhilwal and Am\u00e1w\u00e1n, were brought in by the invasions of Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Sharqi and his grandson Husen Shah, and are the ancestors of the present Chaudhri of Bhilwal, and the taluqdars of Pahremau and Am\u00e1w\u00e1n.\n\nThe Amethias, afterwards destined to be the most important family in the neighbourhood, were already hovering on the confines of Haidargarh.\n\nI will now briefly review the general aspect of the country before its conquest by Tilok Chand. The element of a regular Government had been established by Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Sultan of Jaunpur whose lieutenant ruled from Dalmau, and is still remembered by his tomb composed of vast bricks and slabs of kankar in a fine grove on the banks of the Ganges. The principal Bhar forts were rebuilt and garrisoned and the surrounding country divided into tappas for the administration of justice and the collection of a precarious revenue. Makhd\u00edm Bakhsh and his two sons, Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr and Rukn-ud-d\u00edn, were left as q\u00e1z\u00eds at Rae Bareli, and the most important of the present Musalmans of Dalmau and Salon, Parsh\u00e1depur and M\u00e1nikpur, are descended from judges appointed under the same rule and reinstated at the second conquest by Husen Shah.\n\n* He gave help to Bahlool Lodi by storing food.\u2014See Ferishta.\nThe whole country was still mainly occupied by the Bhars, but in the south the Shekh zamindars of Jal\u00e1lpur, Dehi and Bh\u00e1i, had been settled for two generations; the Kanhpurias were present at the north-east, in the north were the colonies of the six or seven tribes of Hindus and the Path\u00e1ns of Am\u00e1w\u00e1n, while on the borders of the Rae Bareli and Lucknow districts, the Amethias and the Shekhs of Bhilwal were face to face, and had already laid the foundations of a family feud. The Bais parganas of the south-west were empty of their legitimate owners and probably abandoned to the Bhars. In a few years a complete change was to be effected, and the commencement of the sixteenth century may be regarded as the beginning of our modern history.\n\nThe reign of Tilok Chand is probably the most interesting and important epoch in the history of Oudh, and it is here that I particularly deplore the scantiness of my information. The traditions connected with it are at once extravagant and meagre, but through the mists of time we can still discern the figure of a conqueror and a statesman. Of the details of his conquests little is known, and it is probable that as he led a considerable force into a country which had been distracted for two hundred years by the constant wars of the Hindus, the Muhammadans, and the old inhabitants, in the course of which struggle every party had been weakened; and succeeded to the comparatively strong government of Jaunpur, which must have greatly reduced the chances of a successful opposition, he found little difficulty in asserting his supremacy over the whole of eastern Oudh from the Gogra to the Ganges, and from the gates of Lucknow to Partabgarh, of the Sombansi. The only defeat which is recorded of him is when his pretensions were successfully resisted by the Path\u00e1ns of Malihabad; and, indeed, his conciliatory policy was not likely to provoke opposition except in the case of a proud and powerful Musalman family who could not endure even the nominal superiority of a Hindu chieftain.\n\nThe Brahmans of Sultanpur relate that in his old age, like another king of distinguished wisdom, he supported the prodigious responsibility of an establishment of three hundred wives, and by them became the father of a family countless as the sands of the sea.* The princesses of Rewa and Mainpuri to whom he had originally been married, disgusted by an association in which the dignity of castes had not been respected, fled from his castle and gave rise to a distinction between the Bais from within (Bhitaria) and the Bais from without (Baharia), those from without being the offspring of the genuine Rajput blood, while those from within were of contaminated lineage, and occupied a doubtful position in the class system. The K\u00e1yaths of Rae Bareli are never weary of repeating and embellishing the tale of their adoption, and the fact, that to the present day their leading families receive the title of Th\u00e1kur, shows that it is not a pure invention. A probable tradition connects the final establishment of the Kanhpurias in Tiloi and Simrauta with this chief's reign, and the story of his creation of new castes is too well attested and too much opposed to the spirit of Hindu invention to admit of doubt. More than\n\n* The same story is told of S\u00e1\u00ed B\u00e1han, but the application to Tilok Chand is valuable.\none caste of Brahmans are grateful to him for their cord and their privileges, while it is indisputable that he largely increased the number of Chhattri clans. The Ahir Bhale Sultans, the Kahar Mahrors, and the Pargahis directly ascribe their elevation to him; and numerous castes in the Fyzabad and Gonda districts, such as the Gandhariyas, the Naipurias, the Barwars, and the Chahus claim to have been originally Bais, while the equal length of their pedigrees shows that they were established in those districts at about the commencement of the sixteenth century. There are besides numerous families of small zamindars in the east of this district who call themselves Bharadhi Bais, and whose want of any tradition of immigration and peculiar religion distinguish them from the pure Bais of the west.\n\nTwo traditions connected with the Bais colonies on the Gogra deserve to be recorded. One is that as Achal Singh was going to bathe at Fyzabad, a Bais zamindar offered him tribute, and the raja gratefully ordered him to assume the new name of Naipuria. Naipuria is not a more honourable name than Bais, and the literal tradition is obviously improbable, but the times to which the story refers make it significant.\n\nAchal Singh was the last of eight Kalhans rajas, and was succeeded in Gonda by fifteen Bisen rajas, the last of which was the celebrated Debi Bakhsh Singh who lost his estates in the mutiny. The numbers of the generations show that Achal Singh was contemporaneous with Tilok Chand, and the creation of the Naipurias is also referred to that raja's reign.\n\nA second tradition tells how Rae Amba, the son of Tilok Chand, and his younger brother, Rae Mardan, were sent with 5,000 cavalry to Janakpur Tirhoot in the Naipal tarai. On their way back a Sangaldipi Brahman living on the banks of the Gumti complained to him that the Bhar King of Hastinagh\u00e1t had made an offer of marriage to his daughter. The rae represented that he could not take a fort with his cavalry, and advised the Brahman to pretend to submit to the desires of the Bhar. He consequently went to Hastinagh\u00e1t, professed himself delighted at the prospect of so illustrious an alliance, and invited the raja to come at an early date and bear away his bride. The unsuspecting monarch immediately set forth with his servants and people in holiday costume, and on retiring to their encampment after a day spent in revelry, fell an easy and perhaps inglorious prey to the arms of the Chhattri chieftain.\n\nThis service was rewarded by the grant of the zamindari of the Bhar kingdom. Rae Amba had a son called Rae Bidad, who lived at Gajanpur, and was succeeded by his son Rae D\u00fadhich who turned Muhammadan, and was the ancestor of all the present Musalman Bhale Sultans, a name derived from the bhala or light javelin with which this cavalry was armed.\n\nTilok Chand established a series of forts at Khiron (Sathanpur), Sangr\u00e1mpur, and Rae Bareli, the latter of which he entrusted to his favourite D\u00edw\u00e1nand half Rajput L\u00e1l N\u00e9bh Rae. The whole of the traditions connected with this remarkable man lead us to suppose that he embraced the project\nof erecting a kingdom on the union of the hitherto discordant elements which he found in Oudh. With a singular absence of superstition he selected the class system as an admirable instrument for this end, and enrolled the principal families of his own army and of the conquered country in his own clan, fully comprehending that unity of name is almost as powerful as unity of interest.*\n\nThe boundaries of his rule do not now admit of being defined with absolute certainty, but it is possible that he was undisputed king in the twenty-two Bais parganas, while his influence must have extended far beyond those limits.\n\nOn his death the whole structure fell to pieces. Pirthi Chand, one of his sons, took the western province\u2020 with the ancestral castle of Sangr\u00e1mpur, the other, Harhardeo, ruled over the east from S\u00e1thanpur, which his grandfather had built when he conquered the Bhars of the Kh\u00edron pargana. The K\u00e1yaths of Rae Bareli may or may not have acquired a limited dominion in the neighbourhood of that town. The Kanipurias on the death of Parsh\u00e1d Singh fell into three branches, Janga Singh taking Tiloi, Madan Singh Simrauta, and M\u00e1n Singh Ateha.\n\nEven the small clan of the Amethias in Haidargarh divided their possessions, Dingur taking Kumhr\u00e1w\u00e1n, R\u00e1m Singh Ans\u00e1ri, and Lohang R\u00e1\u00e9 Akhaipur, with the pretentious titles of r\u00e1ja, r\u00e1o, and r\u00e1na.\n\nNothing further of importance is recorded till we come to the reign of Hum\u00e1y\u00fan, which was marked by a general conversion to the imperial religion without parallel in the annals of the district. The Bh\u00e1le Sult\u00e1ns, the Bisens of Usm\u00e1npur, and the zamindari families of Bais of Gareu and of Sehen, the Chauh\u00e1ns of Ashanjagatpur and the Raghubans\u00eds of Hardoi, each contributed a convert. The Shekhs of Bhilwal made use of the opportunity presented by the improved condition of their co-religionists to recover their villages from the Amethias. The defeated Hindus submitted gracefully, and one of their number, Jai Singh, received the then fashionable distinguishing mark of Isl\u00e1m. In the general confusion the Bhars left in that neighbourhood rose against the Hindus of Rae Bareli, and succeeded in killing Bhagwati D\u00e1s, the representative of the N\u00e1bh R\u00e1\u00e9, who had been adopted and established there by Tilok Chand. His five sons fled to Allahabad, whence they procured assistance, and their hearty vengeance closes the last appearance of the Bhars in this history.\n\n* It should be remembered that what I have written of the Tilokchandi Bais does not necessarily apply to the innumerable clans of Bais scattered over eastern Oudh from Singramau in Jaunpur to the heart of the Bara Banki district, and from the Gogra to the Ganges. These, instead of the very highest, occupy nearly the lowest position among Oudh Chhatris. They differ from each other and from the real Bais in their family traditions; and while some can boast pedigrees of 25 generations, connecting them with the 13th century and Abhai Chand's invasion, lists of from 14 to 17 generations refer the great majority to the epoch of Tilok Chand. It seems most probable that about 400 years ago numbers of the agricultural and military aristocracy of all castes assumed the title of Bais, in much the same way as the leading families of Orissa and parts of Central India are now claiming to be Chhatris.\n\n\u2020 Worth 14 lakhs.\nThe complete extinction of this people has occasioned much surprise, but it is not difficult to understand. Both the Musalmans and the Hindus were conquering nations, and the hand of each was turned against the old inhabitants whom they wished to dispossess. Against one enemy the Bhars might have stood and retained, even when defeated, a portion of their former rights, but in the wars between the invaders, each victory, to whichever side it inclined, was to them a new defeat, and entailed another onslaught on their possessions. As the balance swayed from side to side in the long and doubtful struggle between the Rajputs and the eastern empire, they suffered with every change of fortune, and were conquered not once but many times. It was not one war of extermination, but the harassing attacks of two centuries, often repeated, each time with new vigour, before which they fell. Their customs, their position, and we may conjecture their language and nationality prevented anything like a perfect union with either of their enemies. And yet there can be no doubt that while many were slain, and many fled to the north and to the east, many still survive in their old territory under modern names. The statesmanship of Tilok Chand elevated not a few of their principal families to the rank of Chhattris, and the Tirgunait Brahmans, the Kharibind Kurmis, the Bharotia and Bhattia Ahirs, and many families of the Gajars, are connected with their race by hardly doubtful tradition. A careful enquiry into the private worship and peculiar customs of the present castes of the district would probably still further disprove the tale of their utter extinction, but it can hardly be a matter for surprise that the more obvious evidences of their kingdom have been swept away.\n\nHitherto I have followed Mr. Bennett, but must now adventure independently in order to make clearer the succession and distribution of property among the sons of Tilok Chand. The first remarkable thing is that neither of the legitimate sons assumed the title of raja, which therefore it is not likely that Tilok Chand himself had claimed. Pirthi Chand, the eldest, took the southern province, ruling from Daundia Khera or Sangrampur; his heritage was worth 14 lakhs; he was called rao; the second, Harhardeo, without any title; his grandson afterwards became rana, took the northern, Khiron and Patan, ruling from Sathanpur; his estate was worth seven lakhs, and the illegitimate son, the Rawat of Harha, got one of five lakhs in that pargana. Now what were the dominions of which this division was made?\n\nThe following list is given by Mr. Elliot. I have corrected it freely:\n\n| District Rae Barell ... | Daundia Khera. |\n|-------------------------|----------------|\n|                         | Uchghon.        |\n|                         | Kumhi.          |\n|                         | Bachhrawan.     |\n|                         | Kahanjar.       |\n|                         | Ghatampur.      |\n|                         | Sareni.         |\n|                         | Magriyana.      |\n|                         | Dalmau.         |\n|                         | Bareli.         |\n|                         | Bihar.          |\n|                         | Patan.          |\n|                         | Panhan.         |\n|                         | Sathanpur.      |\n\n|                         | Harha.          |\n|                         | Purwa.          |\n|                         | Mauranwan.      |\n|                         | Sarwan.         |\n|                         | Asaha.          |\n|                         | Gorinda.        |\n|                         | Parsandan.      |\n\nDistrict Lucknow ... Bijnaur.\nWhy the owner of extensive property like this should not have taken the title of r\u0101ja is not quite clear. But then it is not in the least certain that all these parganas ever did belong to Tilok Chand. Rae Bareli, for instance, is mentioned in the Ain-i-Akbari as the property of the Kanh-purias, Dalmau of Musalmans; if further, the southern parganas belonged to the Sangr\u0101mpur or Mur\u0101rmau houses\u2014how did Harhardeo\u2019s son come down from S\u0101thanpur in Kh\u012bron and take possession of an estate at Khaj\u016brg\u0101on in Daundia Khera? It is also alleged (see Rae Bareli article) that the Bais did not obtain possession of that pargana till about the reign of Jah\u0101ng\u012br. It is not impossible that Tilok Chand, who joined the army of Bahlool Lodi in its last invasion of the Jaunpur kingdom* and rendered material services, may have been appointed Governor under the new dynasty of all the parganas which are recited as his property. His connexion with the Delhi monarch would account for his eldest son and probably himself only boasting the title of r\u0101o, the supreme monarch would not have allowed him to use the prouder title, the symbol of an equal sovereignty.\n\nMr. Elliot\u2019s account of the successors of Tilok Chand is as follows:\u2014\n\n\u201cPirthie Chund\u2019s son was Deorai, in whose time, according to the Bais tradition, the worst disgrace which they had yet known befell the Rajpoots of Oudh. The head of the Buchgotie tribe, who till Tilok Chund\u2019s time had been premier Raja in Oudh, and in whom had been vested the right of confirming the title of each new raja affixing the Tilok to his brow, left the faith of his ancestors and became a Mahomedan. Deorai swore that on no descendant of his should the Tilok be placed by the tainted hands of the pervert, and, with the consent of the brotherhood, his second son assumed the title of Raja, that he might in future place the Tilok on the head of his elder brother\u2019s family. From the eldest son, Bhyrudas, descend the Raos of Doondeea Khera; from the second son, the Rajas of Morar Mow; and the descendants of the third, Kulian Mul, are known as chhotbhyaes or cadeta.\n\n\u201cHurhiurdeo, the brother of Pirthie Chund, in the meanwhile went to Behar, and his two sons settled in the villages of Symbussie and Nyhesta in that pargana.\n\n\u201cThese two in considerable villages gave their names to the branches of the house which sprang from these two brothers, and hence it is popularly said that the Tilokchundi Bais is divided into four branches, Rao, Raja, Symbussi, Nyhesta; the two former being from Tilok Chund\u2019s eldest, the two latter from his younger son.\u201d\n\nNow then we have a distinct and remarkable contradiction between the Unao and the Rae Bareli traditions. The Unao tale contains internal evidence of its truth; it admits that after Tilok Chand\u2019s death none of the heads of the family assumed the title of r\u0101ja. It admits that the family\n\n* Ferishta.\nwas still in the position of feoffer to the D\u00edw\u00e1n of Hasanpur. And here again we come upon a puzzling feudal custom of eastern Oudh. A very clear and widespread tradition represents all r\u00e1jas in those early days as taking investiture from the R\u00e1ja of Hasanpur also called d\u00edw\u00e1n. It is my own impression that he was the Hindu d\u00edw\u00e1n or n\u00e1ib of the Jaunpur kingdom, and that this investiture by him was just the act of homage to the delegate of the Jaunpur suzerain. At any rate, after the Jaunpur kingdom passed away, this exclusive right or rather hegemony passed away also from Hasanpur; the Bais had a r\u00e1ja of their own, so also had the Kanhpurias and the Sombansis, and the latter chief in the 18th century was called to Benares to place the sacred oil or rather clay upon the forehead of the great Bhuinh\u00e1r* r\u00e1ja. The difference between the two traditions is not serious. The Rae Bareli bards declare that the eldest son of Tilok Chand\u2019s grandson became R\u00e1ja of Mur\u00e1rmau, the Cawnpore bards relate that he was a younger son; that the Daundia Khera r\u00e1os, who afterwards divided their property into the Purwa and Daundia Khera estates, were the elder as they were the more powerful branch. The following is the Rae Bareli tale as related by Mr. Benett.\n\nFor some time nothing of note occurred except a division in the Bais r\u00e1ja\u2019s house. Either Deo R\u00e1e or his son, Bhairon D\u00e1s, separated from the main stock, and receiving Daundia Khera and four other villages as their share of the family property, founded the subsequently powerful house of the B\u00e1bus or R\u00e1os of Baisw\u00e1ra. It is probable that their propinquity to the throne, and the personal character of their chiefs from the first gave them great influence, as we find them very shortly afterwards contending on equal terms with the r\u00e1jas of Mur\u00e1rmau. The division probably took place shortly after the general conversion just described.\n\nThe end of Akbar\u2019s reign was a season of great vitality among the Rajput families, which showed itself after the usual fashion by the prosecution of the old, and the successful establishment of new family feuds. It is probable that the dearth of history during this reign may be ascribed to the firm and enlightened rule of the great emperor. When the ruins became relaxed, the whole district was thrown into confusion. In Baisw\u00e1ra itself the most remarkable event was the spread of the Simbasi family. Shakt Singh, the fourth in descent from Harhardeo, invaded the Dalmau pargana, which, though nominally in Baisw\u00e1ra, contained too many powerful Muhammadan families to yield a ready obedience to Bais rule. The expedition was successful, and his sons, Domandeo and Rudr S\u00e1h, succeeded him in the government. Of these the first was celebrated for the largeness of his family, the second for the number of his conquests.\n\nDomandeo, in his fort at Chiloli, added eight sons to the strength of his race, and Rudr S\u00e1h founded S\u00e1hpur and dispossessed his first cousins, the sons of the brothers of Shakt Singh, of the villages which had been assigned for their support. It appears that the achievements of the two brothers were regarded as equally brilliant, and they divided the estate they had\n\n* Oldham\u2019s Gh\u00e1sipur.\nacquired in equal shares, giving rise to the title Adhi\u00e1ri, which, whilst it has been discarded by the proud house of Khaj\u00farg\u00e1on, is retained with complacency by the less fortunate Th\u00e1kurs of Samarpha, the descendants of Rudr S\u00e1h.\n\nOf Domandeo's eight sons, three deserve especial notice. The eldest, Aj\u00edt Singh, succeeded to the Khaj\u00farg\u00e1on chieftainship, and his brothers, Pah\u00e1r Singh and Mitarj\u00edt, attended the brilliant court of Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n, where their yeoman manners seem to have excited some amusement. The sarcasms of the courtiers were repelled by retorts which are fondly preserved by the family, but whose effect must have depended rather on their rudeness than on their wit. They accompanied Prince Aurangzeb on his ill-starred expedition to Candahar, and in the retreat in 1647 A.D., were overwhelmed by an avalanche.* Their present representatives are the Taluqdars of P\u00e1hu and Kurih\u00e1r Sat\u00e1wan.\n\nShortly after the time of Shakt Singh's invasion of Dalmau, his first cousins, Har Singh R\u00e1e and B\u00edr Singh R\u00e1e, founded the present house of Naistha by establishing themselves in the Bih\u00e1r pargana. The R\u00e1ja of Mur\u00e1rmau appears to have regarded their emigration as an invasion of his own dominions, and B\u00edr Singh R\u00e1e was killed by his hand or his forces. The R\u00e1o of Daundia Khera took the part of the Naihestas against the head of his family, and their combined efforts resulted in the death of Bh\u00fapat Singh, and the flight of his widow and son to Rudr S\u00e1h, the warlike chief of the Simbasis. He readily embraced the opportunity, and succeeded at least in re-establishing the youthful Chhatarp\u00e1t Singh in Mur\u00e1rmau, though it does not appear that the rajas ever regained their old position. The Naisthas at any rate retained their new conquests. B\u00edr Singh's sons remained in P\u00e1tan Bih\u00e1r, while R\u00e1m Singh, the son of Harsingh R\u00e1e, removed into the Bachhr\u00e1w\u00e1n pargana, and founded the house of Kurih\u00e1r Sidhauli.\n\nIt must be remembered, therefore, that there was first the elder branch with its R\u00e1ja of Mur\u00e1rmau, its R\u00e1o or B\u00e1bu of Daundia Khera, and its R\u00e1ja of Purwa; this by the way was a man of personal distinction, for R\u00e1ja Achal Singh's descendants were simple b\u00e1b\u00fas. Then there was the younger branch divided into Simbasi with its two R\u00e1nas of Khaj\u00farg\u00e1on and Shan-karpur and the Naistha, with numerous small taluqdars.\n\nThis rapid summary brings our history down to the end of the reign of Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n. The first years of his successor saw the continued depression of the house of Mur\u00e1rmau. Amar Singh was engaged in an incessant petty warfare with R\u00e1o Purandar Singh of Daundia Khera, in which he was invariably the loser, and his death was followed by the ruin of his family. The infant, R\u00e1ja Debi Singh, was left in the charge of his uncle, Gop\u00e1l Singh, who betrayed his trust, and assuming in his own name the property of his orphan nephew and ward gave rise to the R\u00e9jkum\u00e1ri branch\n\n* Their date is further proved by a tradition which describes a duel between Mitarj\u00edt and the famous Rustam Khan.\nwhich retained almost all the r\u0101ja\u2019s villages till it was reduced by R\u0101ja Digbijai Singh in the present century. Debi Singh, when he came of age, sought and obtained the sympathy of the Delhi emperor, but the f\u0101rm\u0101ns by which Muhammad Shah reinstated him in his ancestral dignity were mere waste paper to the practically independent chieftains of Baisw\u0101ra. In the two long reigns of Purandar Singh and Mardan Singh, the b\u0101bus reached the zenith of their fortunes, and acquired the supremacy of the whole of Baisw\u0101ra, with the exception of the territories of the powerful Simbasis of Dalmau and the Naisthas of Sidhauli.\n\nThe reaction against the encroachments of the r\u0101os in Bih\u0101r was headed by the young Chet R\u0101e, an illegitimate son of Ban Singh of Sidhauli. He collected the forces of his house and effectually deterred the aggressor from making any attempt in that direction. His services do not appear to have commanded the gratitude of the reigning chief, who was only compelled by force to recognize his independent position in the pargana of Mau-r\u0101nw\u0101n.\n\nAlone among the Bais he ventured to offer any serious opposition to Nawab Sa\u02bfdat Khan. The story of his siege in his fort at Fachhimg\u0101on is mentioned further on, but some doubt is thrown on the accounts which represent it as merely a sham fight, by the fact that he remained for some time an exile at the court of Panna, and did not return till after the death of the great Nawab.\n\nThe Simbasis in the meanwhile continued to increase and spread in peace, only perhaps occasionally interrupted by boundary disputes with their Kanhpuria neighbours. R\u0101na Ajit Mal\u2019s younger son, Gul\u0101b S\u0101h, separated, and was the founder of the Gaura house, second in importance to that of Khaj\u016brg\u0101on. R\u0101na Kharag Singh, who succeeded Ajit Mal, had two sons, the younger of which built a fort at Shankarpur, since famous as the home of Shiu Farsh\u0101d Singh and his still greater son, R\u0101na Beni M\u0101dh\u014d Bakhsh.\n\nAt the beginning of the eighteenth century, Chhabile R\u0101m, an official in the Allahabad district, was one of the numerous leaders, who, throwing off the semblance of subordination, endeavoured to erect an independent kingdom on the ruins of the Mughal empire. Having occupied the fort at Allahabad, and collected for his own use the revenues of the surrounding country, he crossed the Ganges at Dalmau, and was met by the Simbasi clans under the chieftains of Gaura and Khaj\u016brg\u0101on. After an obstinate resistance the Rajputs were defeated; Chhabile R\u0101m possessed himself of the western parganas of the district. On the accession of Muhammad Shah, he was recalled to Allahabad, and after successfully repulsing two imperial armies, was converted, not conquered, by being recognized as Subahdar of Allahabad. Amar Singh never recovered his position, and it was not till some twenty years later that his grandson, Pah\u0101r S\u0101h, was admitted to engage for the four villages of Khaj\u016brg\u0101on, Sareli, Bajpaipur, and H\u00e1jipur, and resumed the lead of his clan levies. It is possible that if their r\u0101na had been present, Sa\u02bfdat Khan\u2019s assessment of the Dalmau parganas would not have been without its romance.\nPah\u00e1r Singh, the r\u00e1na, emerged from the cloud which had concealed his family since the defeat of his grandfather by Chhabile R\u00e1m at about the same time as Chet R\u00e1e returned from his exile at Panna. With the exception of the name, Mr. Elliot has given a correct account of his disputes with the R\u00e1os of Daundia Khera. After his defeat there he was besieged in his fort at Khaj\u00farg\u00e1o by Chet R\u00e1e, who drove him out, and symbolized the destruction of the place by throwing five of its bricks into the Ganges. His descendants were generally in arms either against Government or their own relations, and their old prestige rendered the acquisition of a taluqa in their case exceptionally rapid. R\u00e1na Raghun\u00e1th Singh was engaged in continual wars with his cousin, Beni M\u00e1dho Bakhsh, whose genius threatened to eclipse the leading house and transfer the title of R\u00e1na to Shankarpur. A ten years' war was ended by the usual compromise by which both competitors were awarded the title. In 1843 A.D., Haidar Hearsey on his way to Partabgarh had left a small detachment at Bhitarg\u00e1o. The r\u00e1na considered this an unwarrantable interference and burnt the station down. Haidar Hearsey was furiously angry at hearing of this act of impertinence, and was not appeased by the ill-success of the artillery he sent to chastise the aggressor. He soon arrived in person, and defeating the r\u00e1na before his new fort at H\u00e1jipur, drove him into the old stronghold of Khaj\u00farg\u00e1o. Here the besiegers were worthily resisted, and their commander himself pointed the gun which he had slung in the branch of a tree overlooking the fortress. Eventually Raghun\u00e1th Singh escaped to the dense jungles of N\u00e1in, and returned to the enjoyment of his estates when the danger had passed. He lived to engage under the English for the largest estates in Baisw\u00e1ra, and was succeeded by his grandson, R\u00e1na Shankar Bakhsh.\n\nGaura presents the same picture of continual opposition to the Lucknow Government, of which some details will be given further on. D\u00edn S\u00e1h, on one of the rare occasions when he condescended to appear in the Dalmau kachahri, drew his sword on the t\u00e1sildar and was himself promptly cut down. On the death of his brother, L\u00e1l S\u00e1h possessed himself of his villages and rapidly acquired an estate. His usurpation of course led to a continual dispute between his descendants and those of his brother, and in 1830 A.D., Inchha Singh, the n\u00e1zim, divided the estate, giving three-fifths to L\u00e1l S\u00e1h's representative, and the remainder to Bajrangbali with the name of Narindpur Charh\u00e1r. From this division it is possible that L\u00e1l S\u00e1h was really the elder brother, but D\u00edn S\u00e1h was up to the time of his death certainly the most prominent of the two.\n\nBikramaj\u00edt, a younger son of L\u00e1l S\u00e1h, got the small estate of Khaj\u00fari. The character of his clan is illustrated by a story told of him in which he rivals Mucius Scevola. Being informed by the n\u00e1zim in kachahri that his assessment was to be raised, he replied by holding up his thumb\u2014a coarse gesture with the same meaning as is expressed in English by extending the fingers from the nose. The incensed official directed that the thumb should be cut off, on which Bikramaj\u00edt turned to his servant, and taking his betel scissors himself cut off the last joint, threw it in the n\u00e1zim's face, and walked out of the tent.\nAnother story is told of a Bais zamindar who, when he was brought from prison to kachahri, made a dart at the sword which was lying before the n\u00e1zim's masned and struck at his tyrant's head. The discomposed official rolled backward off his pile of cushions, the sword passed through his clothes, and the Bais immediately plunged it into his own body and fell down dead. We may perhaps congratulate ourselves that such scenes do not occur in our own kachahris.\n\nThe taluqa of Girdh\u00e1pur was got together by mortgage by a younger branch of the r\u00e1nas's house, who were originally zamindars of K\u00edratpur Charh\u00e1r.\n\nOf Kurih\u00e1r Sat\u00e1wan little remains to be said. When Gur Bakhsh Singh died childless, R\u00e1na Raghus\u00e9th Singh managed to get his il\u00e1qa, and kept it till 1832 A.D. Fateh Bah\u00e1dur, the adopted son, recovered it in the succeeding year with the help of R\u00e1na Beni M\u00e1dho, who stood his security, and in his turn possessed himself of the estate. General Sleeman interfered, and Fateh Bah\u00e1dur recovered it on the payment of Rs. 40,000 arrears. His son, Chandrap\u00e1l Singh, him, succeeded and died immediately on emerging from the tutelage of the Court of Wards.\n\nOf Domandeo's descendants, Pilkha and P\u00e1hu remain. The original village of the first family was Jagatpur Kota, and their attempts to form a taluqa were not successful. Two small collections of villages were made, but both were almost immediately absorbed by the r\u00e1nas, and they now possess little more than their zamindari inheritance. The latter house does not fall within this district, and when I was transferred to another, I had as yet made no enquiries into their history.\n\nOf Rudr S\u00e1h's descendants, Daulat Singh of Samarpha engaged for only one village. His son, L\u00e1lji, began the foundation of a taluqa, and maintained it in two fights with the N\u00e1zims, Jai R\u00e1m P\u00e1nde in 1820, and Qutb-ud-d\u00edn Hasan Khan in 1827 A.D. His wealth is proved by the fact that he built the great bazar of Lalganj, the central mart of Beisw\u00e1ra. The widow of his son adopted Basant Singh who himself died childless during the mutiny, and was succeeded by his widow Dari\u00e1o Kunwar.\n\nAlmost the same story might be told with altered names for Chandania. Dalpat Singh, the ally of D\u00edn S\u00e1h of Gaura, was temporarily driven out, and separate engagements taken for all the neighbouring villages. On the return of L\u00e1l S\u00e1h, he too returned, and he and his son put together the estate now held by Sard\u00e1r Singh.\n\nAt the time of Sa\u00e1dat Khan's invasion, Sadak Singh, the half brother of Chet R\u00e1c, held the gaddi of Kurih\u00e1r Sidhaul\u00ed. His importance may be conjectured from his marriage with a sister of the celebrated rebel Bhagwant R\u00e1c Kh\u00edch\u00e1r, and both he and his father ruled an extensive tract stretching from Bachhr\u00e1w\u00e1n into the heart of the Lucknow district, embracing, at any rate nominally, nine parganas.\n\nThe direct line became extinct on the death of the brothers Bikramaj\u00edt and Sikandar Singh, and a cousin who had been converted to Muham-\nmadanism was adopted as successor. His son found no difficulty in returning to the religion of his forefathers, but the family still fasten their clothes in the Muhammadan fashion. A son of Rahmat Ali Singh acquired the small estate of Udhrera, a great portion of which was almost immediately lost to the Bani\u00e1ns of Maur\u00e1nw\u00e1n.\n\nThe r\u00e1ja's house remained in the obscurity into which it had fallen on the death of Amar Singh. Digbijai Singh was, like Tilok Chand, brought up in his mother's house at Patti Saifabad, and on reaching manhood succeeded in regaining some of the villages which had been usurped by his cousins of the Rajkum\u00e1ri branch. Up till annexation he never engaged for more than Rs. 5,000 or 6,000, and the present estates of his son, R\u00e1ja Shiup\u00e9l Singh, were mostly confiscated from B\u00e1bu R\u00e1m Bakhsh and R\u00e1na Beni M\u00e1dho, and granted to the r\u00e1ja in reward for his saving European lives during the mutiny.\n\nA careful look at the genealogical tree of the Bais will show, more clearly than any description could, the ramification of their different families. Of these only three besides the R\u00e1o of Daundia Khera possess estates in the Unao district. They are the Simbasi family of P\u00e1hu, the Naibesta house of Pachhimg\u00e1on, and the Chhotbh\u00e1iya of Sandana. Of two of these very little mention need be made. The Sandana family are much impoverished, and now possess only two villages where they once had sixty. The P\u00e1hu taluqa is also much fallen away from what it was when Mitarj\u00edt first founded it, but Bh\u00fap Singh has still some 20 villages in his estate.\n\nMitarj\u00edt is a favourite hero with the bards, who tell many stories of his prowess and of the amusement which his rustic plainness occasioned at the Delhi court. When he first went to Delhi he attended the darb\u00e1r, but stood outside the entrance, expecting some one to invite him in. He waited till it was all over, and when the R\u00e1jas of Jaipur and M\u00e1rv\u00e1r were passing out they noticed his country manner, and thinking to make fun of him asked who he was? They were told \"a R\u00e1ja of Baisw\u00e1ra.\" One asked \"what he wore two swords for?\" \"To fight any two men who dare to meet me\" said he. The other asked \"why did he not enter the darb\u00e1r, but stood without at the door?\" He replied \"that in his country it was customary to invite the stranger, not to leave him to push his way in uninvited, but that as they had given their daughters and sisters to the king, of course they could not be looked on as strangers; so they were quite right to go in.\" Incensed at this insult, they challenged him to single combat.\n\nMitarj\u00edt came to the field mounted on a mare, who on the first onset became uncontrollable and ran away with him; with great trouble he stopped her and dismounted, pronouncing a curse on any member of his race who should ever cross a mare's back; and to this day no Bais of the house of P\u00e1hu can be induced to mount a mare. Mitarj\u00edt returned to the field on foot, and wounded both his antagonists.\n\nA more corrected account may now be given of the r\u00e1o, or Daundia Khera branch of the family, which up till the end of the eighteenth century\nwas much the most powerful. These scattered sketches of the scions of this great family will, it is hoped, afford an idea of the utter historical confusion and actual anarchy which the rule of a Hindu clan exemplifies.\n\nAlthough so nearly connected, the r\u00e1o and r\u00e1ja were soon at deadly feud with one another. R\u00e1o Kanak Singh killed the r\u00e1ja of the time being, who had previously killed his brother Barsinghdeo. The blood feud was never stanch\u00e9d, and the r\u00e1ja was the chief sufferer, for though the r\u00e1o in later days was highly unpopular, and the sympathies of every Bais except his own branch of the family were against him, he kept up a constant pressure on the r\u00e1ja, till he reduced him almost to a nonentity, his estate having fallen away to Rs. 6,000 in 1856.\n\nIn the ninth generation from Tilok Ghand, about 1,700 A.D., R\u00e1o Mardan Singh was beginning to be famous. Hitherto the r\u00e1os had been content with the seven and a half parganas which form the Daundia Khera estate, but Mardan Singh recovered the seven parganas in the Unao district, which had been lost to Baisw\u00e1ra since Tilok Chand\u2019s time, and he also took from the Simbasis by force of arms, the greater part of P\u00e1tan and Bih\u00e1r. About the same time, Chaitr\u00e1j, an illegitimate son of Sidhauli, separated from his father\u2019s house, and built a fort at Paclhhimg\u00e1on (pargana Maur\u00e1nw\u00e1n), where he acquired a considerable estate. He was a skilful and daring warrior, and though none of them would have admitted him to sit or eat on equal terms with them, the whole Naihesta branch recognised his superiority in warlike matters; so that he was looked on as the military leader of that portion of the Bais. Many ballads are extant extolling his gallant deeds, and one of them narrates the following story, which is interesting, not only as an example of Rajput pride, but as illustrating the nature of a revenue settlement in those days. When Sa\u00e1dat Khan was appointed Governor of Oudh, he found that the revenue system of the province had fallen into great disorder under his predecessor, R\u00e1ja Girdhar Bah\u00e1dur, and he resolved to repair this by a personal progress through the country and examination into the state of things. When he reached Maur\u00e1nw\u00e1n he summoned all the q\u00e1n\u00fanges of Baisw\u00e1ra, and called on them to produce the \u201cdaul\u201d or rent-roll of their respective parganas. They said what daul will you have, and on being asked the meaning of their answer, they explained that there were two dauls which a q\u00e1n\u00fange could give in\u2014the \u201ccoward\u2019s daul\u201d and the \u201cman\u2019s daul.\u201d In the \u201ccoward\u2019s daul\u201d against every landowner\u2019s name was written only the same sum which had been fixed on him at the last assessment, but in the \u201cman\u2019s daul\u201d every one\u2019s rent was raised in proportion to the improvement that had taken place in his land, Sa\u00e1dat Khan called for the \u201cman\u2019s daul,\u201d and the assessment of Baisw\u00e1ra was doubled.\n\nThen having summoned the agents of all the r\u00e1jas and landowners in full darb\u00e1r, he placed before him on one side a heap of p\u00e1n leaves, on the other a heap of bullets, and bade the agents, if their masters accepted the terms offered them, to take up the p\u00e1n, if not, the bullets. One after another they came forward and every one took up a p\u00e1n leaf. Sa\u00e1dat Khan turned round to one of his courtiers, and said in a sneering aside\u2014\u201cI had heard\ngreat things of the fighting men of Baisw\u00e1ra, but they seem readier to pay than to fight.\" By this time the p\u00e1n had been accepted by every one except the agent of Chet R\u00e1e, who as being illegitimate held the lowest rank, and therefore came last in order. He stepped forward and said\u2014\n\n\"Nawab, my master was ready to accept your terms, but if you wish to see how a Bais can fight, he will not refuse to gratify you. Give him but a day to prepare himself, and then lead your forces against his fort.\" Next day Sa\u00e1dat Khan attacked Pachhimg\u00e1on, and the battle raged all that day with no success to the besiegers. In the evening the Nawab admiring the gallant bearing of the man, sent to say he was quite satisfied with that specimen of the bravery of Baisw\u00e1ra, and if Chet R\u00e1e would come in now, he should be assessed at only half the sum that had been fixed on his estate. Chet R\u00e1e accepted the terms and was received by the Government with great distinction. From Baisw\u00e1ra Sa\u00e1dat went on, past Tiloi and Amethi (in both of which places the r\u00e1jas resisted him and were defeated) to Fatehpur where, after a sanguinary battle, he defeated and killed Bhagwant Singh Kh\u00edch\u00e1r, who had rebelled against the Delhi Government, and had already defeated the wazir's forces in a pitched battle. Returning thence to Delhi, the king asked him if he had found the people in those parts as turbulent as he had expected. \"No\" he said. \"No one gave me any serious trouble except the half sword of Chet R\u00e1e, and the whole sword of Bhagwant Kh\u00edch\u00e1r.\" Sa\u00e1dat Khan's assessment was very heavy (he is said to have raised the revenue of Oudh from seventy lakhs to two crores), and when (in 1740) Mans\u00far Ali Khan succeeded his uncle, and began a similar progress through the country, a panic seized all Baisw\u00e1ra lest he should demand a similar increase on the former taxation, which was more than the land could afford to pay. Many of the landowners fled across the Ganges in anticipation of his arrival, and there was a general uneasiness. R\u00e9o Mardan Singh was now grown old, and desired to end his days in quiet and to divide his estates among his sons; so he called them to him, and asked their advice in the present emergency. The eldest, Raghun\u00e1th Singh, advised instant flight to Daundia Khera, from whence if necessary they could cross the Ganges in a moment. The second, Udat Singh, could not see the use of flying,\" the Nawab had not come yet; perhaps he would not come at all; perhaps he would not impose hard terms; and if he did, they had the fort there in which to fight him; and if they found themselves getting the worst of it, then as a last resource they could fly.\" The third son, Achal Singh, said \"the Nawab has not yet crossed the Sai. Let me go to him at once, and he will be pleased at our coming in so early to proffer allegiance, and we shall secure good terms.\"\n\nR\u00e9o Mardan then told them that he had spoken to try them, and that he should divide his estate among them according to their answers. To Raghun\u00e1th Singh he gave Daundia Khera with its seven and a half par-ganas, saying that he would now be as far off as possible from the seat of Government, and could always gratify his propensity for running away. To Udat Singh he gave the recently annexed par-ganas of P\u00e1tan Bih\u00e1r, saying that he was brave and daring, and would have plenty to do to maintain himself there against his antagonists. To Achal he gave the\nsix parganas attached to Purwa (i.e., all the Baisw\u00e1ra parganas in Unao except Maur\u00e1n\u00e1n), as he would then be nearest the seat of Government, and be best able to keep on good terms with the Governor.\n\nAchal Singh was received into high favour by Mans\u00far Ali Khan, who entrusted to him the collection of revenue throughout all Baisw\u00e1ra. Udat Singh was less fortunate. The Simbasi and Naihesta branches combined to recover their former possessions in P\u00e1tan Bih\u00e1r. Amar Singh (Simbasi), ancestor of the present R\u00e1na Raghn\u00e1th, and Chet R\u00e1e of Pachhimgaon, were their leaders, and defeated the force of Udat and Achal Singh in a battle in which Udat lost his life.\n\nAchal Singh retired to his fort at Purwa greatly dispirited, and when his enemies determined to attack him there, it was with great difficulty that he was persuaded to try the chance of a second battle. But in the meantime something had re-opened the old quarrel between the Simbassis and Naihesta, and Chet R\u00e1e withdrew his forces in the middle of the fight. Amar Singh in consequence was totally defeated, and lost even those attendants of victory in which a Rajput's pride is so much wrapped up, his nag\u00e1ras or kettle-drums. Achal Singh sent them to Daundia Kh\u00e9ra to be carefully kept by the head of the house, and they were there till the rebellion broke out, and probably were destroyed when the fort of Daundia Kh\u00e9ra was taken by Sir H. Grant in April, 1858. Not long before the annexation R\u00e1na Raghn\u00e1th Singh sent to R\u00e1o R\u00e1m Bakhsh Singh to negotiate about their restoration, to which the R\u00e1o replied that the only way in which they could be recovered was the same as the way in which they had been lost. This challenge the r\u00e1na did not care to take up.\n\nIn 1655, when Shuj\u00e1-ud-daula had been defeated by the Company's troops at Buxar, he fled along the banks of the Ganges to Farukhabad.\n\nAs he passed Daundia Kh\u00e9ra, R\u00e1o Raghn\u00e1th Singh shut his gates on him, and refused not only to admit him, but also to assist him with provisions and men. He then pursued his way till he reached Harha where Achal Singh was at the time, and was received by him with every mark of sympathy and respect.\n\nAchal gave him both supplies and men, and as he was travelling too lightly to carry a large treasury with him, sent a quarter's revenue, which was due from Baisw\u00e1ra, to him at Farukhabad. The province was so much disturbed that he had to conceal the money in fagots of wood, which he put on men's heads, who thus passed through the country unmolested. When peace was restored, Shuj\u00e1-ud-daula marked his gratitude by showing him the highest favour and remitting three lakhs from the revenue assessment of Baisw\u00e1ra, and also by conferring the title of r\u00e1ja\u2014an honour which strange to say has been acknowledged and confirmed by the people.\n\nThis is perhaps the only case in which a title conferred by Government on a Rajput Taluqdar has met with the sanction of the brotherhood, and has taken root in popular parlance.\nWhile Shuj\u00e1-ud-daula lived Achal Singh prospered, but the favourite of the father could hardly be popular with the son, and on \u00c1sif-ud-daula's accession in 1776 A.D., his accounts were examined, he was declared a defaulter, and deposed from his position. A Sarwaria Brahman, R\u00e1ja Bhaw\u00e1n\u00ed Singh, was made n\u00e1zim in his place. Achal Singh deeply resented this. One day when he was attending the n\u00e1zim's darbar, he received some slight insult, on which he instantly took poison and died on the spot. The pacific character of Achal Singh descended to his progeny, but did not serve them as well, for the family have been getting poorer in every generation. They had no party in the country to support them; for, as before remarked, the Bais has not colonised at all in these parganas, and R\u00e1o Mardan conquered them merely by force of arms. Achal's descendants threw away the sword with which the estate had been won, and remained dependent on the complaisance of the n\u00e1zim, who, if their friend, would sometimes make over to them a large estate, or sometimes refuse them a single village. Thus the present representative of the family, B\u00e1bu Debi Bakhsh, has had at one time an estate worth Rs. 50,000 given him, but in most years his possessions have been only one or two small rent-free villages. But for the accidental finding of a large treasure in the fort of Purwa, the family could not have kept up their dignity and position so long, and when Debi Bakhsh forfeited everything by his obstinate persistence in passive rebellion, the glory of the house departed.\n\nThere are many most interesting points connected with the Tilokchandi Bais, if space would permit of dealing with them. The direct descendants of Tilok Chand in the legitimate line have sixteen taluqas and 779 villages, paying a revenue of Rs. 5,71,143 in the Rae Bareli district alone. The extraordinary thing is that, notwithstanding the vicissitudes of families, notwithstanding the internal wars and external pressure of an almost always hostile Government, this family has kept firm hold of such vast property.\n\nWhile the much more numerous Kath Bais, who allege an equally lofty royal lineage, have only as yet been able to acquire one village, the Tilokchandi Bais kept 900. Wars and intestine quarrels have weakened the Tilokchandis, around them the other clans have always been hovering, watching for an unguarded moment to break within their fence and appropriate some of the rich lands which are always the first aspiration of a Hindu. Apparently landed property then distributed among a few must have been in a state of unstable equilibrium, yet till the mutiny of 1857 tempted the lords of Daundia Khera and Shankarpur to measure swords with the British, the power of the Tilokchandi seems to have been almost unbroken. This partly seems due to the liberal way in which the younger branches of the family were always provided for. The eldest son seems generally to have got only a larger portion than the others, innumerable divisions of the property took place, the head of the family only had property worth six thousand rupees out of the six hundred thousand owned by the clan.\n\nThe very same thing is to be noted with the Kanhpurias and Sombansis; the most powerful and prosperous Hindu clans were those who\nneglected in practice the principle of primogeniture, and regarded their raja not as the lord of the clan's property but as the ceremonial chief, the social leader, and nothing more; who were prepared to follow the military guidance of any able scion of the family in despite of, or even in opposition to the nominal head to whom their allegiance was due. At the same time there is no doubt that the name of Tilok Chand and the credit of a lofty lineage have had a wonderfully conservative effect upon the minds of the Hindus, constraining naturally dissonent elements into harmony.\n\nTheir estates are occupied by more than half a million of inhabitants, whom their internal wars have made miserable for three hundred years, yet, as Mr. Benett points out, not so miserable as they would have been without them. There is no longer now a necessity for them, and there is little doubt that if the fostering hand of Government were withdrawn, the whole Tilokchandi clan in the space of a hundred years would give place to men more in accord with the spirit of the time. That their subjects are beginning to question that divinity whose potency was rudely assailed in 1857 is evident from the following anecdote related by Colonel Macandrew:\n\n\"These call themselves Tilokchandi Bais to distinguish them from the Kath Bais, who are supposed to be the offspring of the real Bais by women of inferior caste. The Tilokchandi Bais will neither eat nor intermarry with them. An instance of this was exemplified the other day when the proposal was made that the Bais should erect a bridge over the Sai at Rae Bareli. The Tilokchandis proposed that the Kath Bais should subscribe. The latter at once professed their willingness to do so provided the Tilokchandis would acknowledge them to be Bais by eating with them. Nothing more was heard of the proposal that they should subscribe. The Kath Bais are scattered over the district, generally in considerable communities, holding their villages both from Government and from the taluqdars; there are no Kath Bais taluqdars.\"\n\nAs a general rule family trees are not given in this work, but an exception must be made in honour of this heroic clan, nearly every name in whose roll has a place in the annals of Oudh chivalry.\nMr. Benett's account of the district generally may now be reverted to.\n\nThe q\u00e1n\u00fangos and q\u00e1z\u00eds of Rae Bareli were naturally anxious to take a place in the taluqdari system, but their attempts were always foiled by their too powerful neighbours, and they were only able to acquire the small estates of Hard\u00e1spur and Binohra.\n\nEach family of Musalmans was vexed by its special enemy among the Hindus. Those of Bareli by the K\u00e1yaths, of Bhilwal by the Amethias, and of Pahremau by the Kanhpurias. Up to annexation the first two were tolerably evenly matched, but the Path\u00e1ns of Pahremau had long been overpowered. Subdued by Mohan Singh of Tiloi, they afterwards enjoyed a brief respite during the vigorous period of Mughal ascendancy, and were again utterly ruined by Tiloi and Simrauta on the revival of Hindu power. For thirty years they supplicated the courts for their ancestral villages, and were reinstated at the fortunate moment when the wicked ceased to have the power of troubling. During the mutiny they were again burnt out, and that they now hold a small estate is to be ascribed only to the restoration of English Government.\n\nThe Chaudhris of Kh\u00edron were more successful, and Raghun\u00e1th Singh, the descendant of a Janw\u00e1r soldier, who had settled there in Aurangzeb's reign, supplied by his money his want of family interest. He held his villages however on a very precarious tenure, and was constantly being ousted by one or another of the Bais competitors, nor is it likely that his possession would have been long maintained if annexation had not frozen the waves.\n\nThough not falling directly within the scope of this report, it may not be out of place to mention that the once illustrious r\u00e1jas never succeeded in acquiring any large estates. In about 1750 A.D., a Mahratta force under a leader known on the spot as Bargi R\u00e1o occupied M\u00e1nikpur, and found ten months amply long enough to ruin the local chieftains, and impress a lasting memory of their sojourn. A Muhammadan family is not supported by that living organization which preserves the Hindu clan and its r\u00e1ja, and when it falls it rarely recovers itself. Thus the Gardezis retained little but their title and the ruins of their palaces, and when the game of taluqa-making commenced were unable to take a hand. The Bisens and the Kanhpurias filled the void they had left, and absorbed into their estates the villages of their old parganas. The three prominent characters just before annexation were B\u00e1bu R\u00e1m Bakhsh, R\u00e1na Raghun\u00e1th Singh, and R\u00e1na Beni M\u00e1dho Bakhsh, the two former supported by great wealth and the prestige of an illustrious pedigree; the latter celebrated for his undaunted bravery and extraordinary bodily vigour.\n\nHitherto it has been my endeavour to state clearly the bare facts through which the present social order has been developed, but my report would be incomplete, if not unintelligible, without a short commentary describing the stages and manner of the development. This divides itself naturally into three periods, the first extending from the invasion of Shah\u00e1b-ud-d\u00edn Ghori to the downfall of Jaunpur, the second beginning with the kingdom\nof Tilok Chand and ending with the reconquest by Sa\u00e1dat Khan, and the last reaching down to annexation, during which the whole social fabric was changed by the Lucknow Government. Throughout, the main fact has been the living growth of Hinduism, beside which the Muhammadan empires, with their elaborate revenue systems and network of officials, have been merely secondary causes, like artificial dams, temporarily impeding and distorting the course of a strong river.\n\nOf the first period little remains to be said. The Hindu clans were slowly and painfully acquiring their hold on the soil which was never to be permanently loosened. Their opponents were the Muhammadans, who like them were invaders, and a Government already established in the country. There are good grounds for believing that they found congenial elements on the spot in the remains of older Hindu clans, who were living in a state of subjection to the Bhars, but this subject is enveloped in much obscurity, and I have not the information which would enable me to speak with clearness and certainty.\n\nAll account of Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn's connection with Oudh has been omitted. There can be no doubt that he sent frequent expeditions into the country, and his name is still dimly remembered; but the fact that Chhattri pedigrees are silent on the point, proves that at that time the great clans of the present day were not in the position of rulers; and the not unfrequent discovery of old Muhammadan coins in Bhar remains countenances the conjecture that the kingdom of that people was still flourishing. He yet lives vividly in M\u00e1nikpur tradition, which represents that Jal\u00e1l-ud-d\u00edn's head was cut off as he was crossing the river from Karra, and carried by the waves of the Ganges to the opposite shore, confusing with the more famous story some circumstances of a Jaunpur sedition more than a hundred and fifty years later. A bluff promontory overlooking Karra may have been the site of the fatal pavilion, and three small tombs are pointed out as covering the bodies of the old emperor and two of his relations. Amidst a tangled underwood of briers, the remains of an ancient mosque and a small stone slab before which villagers worship the impress of the feet of Buddha, under the name of the Bhumia R\u00e1ni (earth queen) carry the imagination past a series of fallen empires.\n\nEverything leads me to believe that up to the end of the first chapter the invading Hindus had acquired no prominent position. Their most powerful clan do not pretend to have spread beyond the very limited tract now known as the seven and a half parganas, and the names Siddh\u00fapur and Gh\u00e1tampur, with their separate families of Siddh\u00fapuri and Gh\u00e1tampuri Bais, probably mark the encroachments of successive r\u00e1jas. After having been driven back by the Jaunpur empire the returning wave found nothing to oppose it, and spread far and wide over the whole of the country.\n\nThe kingdom of Tilok Chand probably resembled in every way that of the great Hindu r\u00e1jas of the west, and it is not likely that he was more than nominally dependent on the distant and distracted empire of Delhi. It has been seen the kingdom broke up immediately on the death of its founder; but it was unquestionably at this time that the country was first\nroughly distributed among the clans according to their position on the map of the present day. The accounts of the half century which elapsed between the death of Tilokchand and the accession of Akbar are very meagre, but no important new houses were thrown off, and it may be surmised that the R\u00e1ja of Mur\u00e1rmau, and the R\u00e1na of Kh\u00edron, and the Kanhpuria chieftains of Tiloi, Ateha and Simrauta, each exercised on a smaller scale the sovereign powers of the first great r\u00e1ja. Some light is thrown on the influence of Tilok Chand by the thorough insignificance of the older Kaithola r\u00e1ja, when compared with the descendants of Parsh\u00e1d Singh, a cadet of the same house, whose greatness dates from this period.\n\nUnder the vigorous administration of Akbar and his successors, the Hindu clans were naturally much depressed, and driven, so to speak, nearer to the soil. Their connection with the villages in their domain became much closer, new villages were founded, and the increasing numbers of each family led to the establishment of the non-cultivating village proprietors who are now known in our courts as old zamindars. The intervention of a foreign rule, and the diminished danger of invasion from without, deprived the r\u00e1jas of half their attributes; the principle of unity was lost sight of, and each member of a leading house was able when he separated to assume in his new home almost all the privileges retained by the head of his family. The ties of kinsmanship were however still vividly recognized, and at the end of this period instead of a few unconnected r\u00e1jas, we find hierarchies of powerful zamindars, each immediate proprietor and landlord of a few villages from which he drew his subsistence, and acknowledged head of a larger circle from which he collected the militia levies of his clansmen and their dependents for the prosecution of his private disputes, or at the summons of the chieftain of his tribe.\n\nWhen the Mahratta wars distracted the forces of the empire, and the province of Oudh was no longer regarded at the Mughal court, the clan system at once reassumed its old form as far as it was compatible with the modifications which had been introduced during the preceding century. The flames of war broke out over the whole district, and the subordinate centres of power united themselves for conquest or defence under the banners of a leading r\u00e1ja, who again exercised the royal authority which had fallen into abeyance. In his mud fort surrounded by the mud hovels of his servants and the few handi craftsmen needful for the ordinary wants of himself and his household, he received in council the heads of the infeudated families, or held a court of justice to dispose of the principal disputes of his subjects; and when he went to war he was followed by an enthusiastic army attached to himself and to each other by the closest ties of common origin and common interests. Within his r\u00e1j he exercised every degree of authority from the absolute proprietorship of his private villages to the receipt of a feudal allegiance from the great zamindars; and isolated in the midst stood the large Muhammadan towns where the q\u00e1zi still dispensed the Koran, and the kotw\u00e1l preserved order and collected a few unimportant transit dues.\n\nTwo direct acts of ownership were exercised by the r\u00e1ja over the soil. The first was the appropriation of villages for the support of the younger\nbranches of his family and his principal retainers. When the head fort became over-crowded, one or more communities of cultivators were assigned to each of the offshoots which could not be accommodated at home, the assignees went to reside in the villages granted to them, and instead of being an inconvenience and possible source of danger, contributed to the power of their chieftain. These idle and warlike bodies of zamindars were found so useful in times of disturbance that their number was continually being increased by Rajputs from the Du\u00e1b, who came to reside at the direct invitation of the lord paramount, or by members of wedding processions who were induced to make their visit permanent.\n\nThe second direct proprietary act was the allotment of small patches of uncultivated land chiefly to Brahmins. Such grants were sanctioned by all the solemnity of religious formalities, and the grantor had the satisfaction of knowing that he secured the peace of his soul in the next world, while the presentation of a handsome tribute or the remission of a troublesome debt facilitated the conduct of the wars of this, and relieved him of the necessity, always so hateful to a Chhattri, of making a regular sale of his land. Similar grants were often made from purely superstitious motives, to reward a successful astrologer, pension the family priest, or secure the services of a celebrated pandit. Generally it may be said that while the right to pay, as well as exemption from, the revenue was conferred by the Delhi government, the proprietary right in the soil was derived from the Hindu raja. Imperial grants though occasionally frequent in the neighbourhood of Muhammadan colonies, bear a very small proportion, indeed, to the mass of proprietary rights derived from the latter source.\n\nTwo other rights may be enumerated as invariable attributes of Hindu chieftainship. The first was the calling out of the clan levies. The principal subordinates held their lands on the condition of military service; and the regular enforcement of this condition by the raja against the larger zamindars, and by them over the villages within the circle of their influence, is one of the most striking points of resemblance between the social system of India, and the feudalism of Europe. The exercise of this right was strongly approved of by public opinion, and the man who refused to attend when the \"goh\u00e1r\" was sent round, was sure at least of having his house burnt about his head.\n\nThe second was the receipt of tribute which his subjects never withheld even in the worst days of his struggle with the central authority, and sent to him with almost equal regularity when he was ruling with despotic power from his fort, and when he was a proscribed rebel hiding for his life in the jungles. Twice at least in every year\u2014at the Holi in spring, and at the festival which commemorates R\u00e1m's victory over R\u00e1wan in the autumn, the villagers flocked to offer their tribute to their hereditary ruler; and it is probably from this source that his never overfull treasury received its principal supplies.\n\nIn this way the Kanhpuria had carried his conquests from Rae Bareli and M\u00e1nikpur far into the Fyzabad and Bara Banki districts; the Sombansi\nwas the head of another considerable principality containing the present seat of his clan, and stretching across the Ganges to the east of Allahabad; the r\u0101na led a number of almost equal chieftains in Rae Bareli, Dalmau, Khiron, and Sareni. The R\u0101o of Daundia Khera ruled from Bih\u0101r to the centre of Unao; and the Naihesta at Sidhauli held Bachhr\u0101w\u0101n and several parganas in the present district of Lucknow.\n\nNo very clear record is preserved of the relations which existed between the Hindu and Mughal governments; generally the chiefs seem to have held aloof, and looked on at a system of officials they were not strong enough to interfere with. Occasionally they contributed a quota of men to the imperial forces, and every now and then a troublesome chief was conciliated by j\u0101gir of territories already practically his own. The grants of mansabs became especially common in the period of weakness which succeeded the outbreak of the Mahratta wars, when the emperors were glad to attach to themselves powerful elements which they could not subdue. But we never find any great house taking a place in the regular ranks of local officials, and the fact that the office of chaudhri was never held by one of the leading clans of the district, throws some light on their position. The nature of this office is accurately described by Mr. Elliot in his chronicles of Oonao. It was generally held by respectable but thoroughly second rate families, such as the Janw\u0101rs of Khiron, Kath Bais of Jagdispur, the Shekhs of Bhilwal, and the K\u0101yaths of Rae Bareli. The Bais, the Kanhpurias, Sombansis, and even the Amethias never contributed a single member to this order. The Bisens of R\u0101mpur might be quoted as an exception, but the universal tradition of the neighbourhood asserts that they rose on the ruins of the r\u0101je family of M\u0101nikpur after its destruction by the Mahratta; and its truth is, in my opinion, strongly confirmed by the fact that they and not the r\u0101jes were the pargana chaudhris.\n\nSa\u0101dat Khan\u2019s invasion of this district was particularly well timed. Mardan Singh was past the prime of life, and the expiring embers of the opposition to the aggressive policy of Daundia Khera had been resuscitated by Chet R\u0101e: where one chieftain might have been successful two were certain to fail. The R\u0101nas of Khaj\u016brg\u0101on had shortly before been humbled by Chhab\u012bl\u0113 R\u0101m of Allahabad; and the R\u0101ja of Tiloi, after having reduced all other elements of resistance, was too old and feeble to assert his independence, as he certainly would have ten years earlier.\n\nThe first problem which presented itself to the conqueror was the union of the elements he found existing in Oudh, under his own central authority; and a promising solution was arrived at when he acknowledged the chiefs in their respective parganas, and entrusted to them the collection of the Government revenue. The arrangement was in every way a good one, as the pargana boundaries very generally corresponded with the limits of the chieftain\u2019s authority and the distribution of his clan, and each was already furnished with a body of hereditary revenue officials.\n\nThe chieftain was allowed to retain rent-free the villages which he had previously kept for his own maintenance, and as neither he nor Delhi had probably drawn much revenue for many years from the remainder, it was not to be anticipated that he would feel much repugnance to the collection\nof an impost which did not affect himself. His old tribute was sanctioned and defined by the permission to levy for his own use two rupees per annum from each village in his pargana, and he could hardly have incurred much danger by exceeding this moderate limit. In one case I noticed a curious order providing for the senior but less important Kumhr\u00e1w\u00e1n house by the grant of one anna on the cultivated bigha throughout the four parganas which had been assigned in the usual form to the Pukhra Ans\u00e1ri Amethia.\n\nThe power of disposing of the waste lands was never interfered with, and in many cases* the deed of the local chieftain was sanctioned by a sanad from Lucknow. He was not however permitted to assign whole villages as before, and his position is forcibly illustrated by the permission occasionally given him to purchase the right of engaging for the Government demand as proprietor in particular villages in which he already collected the revenue as head of the pargana. In these pargana grants he is usually described as the zamindar, but I have seen the word taluqdar applied as early as 1760 A.D. to Diw\u00e1n Bakhsh, who collected the revenue of the Maur\u00e1nw\u00e1n pargana, holding three villages as his private property, and receiving one rupee at each harvest from each of the rest. This compromise seems to have been very usual, and except in the case of an obstinate rebel like Balbhaddar Singh, to have been attended by tolerable success down to near the end of the eighteenth century.\n\nAt that time the heavy demands of the English and the extravagance of the Nawabs had brought the country to the verge of bankruptcy, and every nerve was stretched to realize as much revenue as could possibly be extorted from the people. The pargana tenure was found clumsy and unprofitable, and separate engagements were taken from the village proprietors. This proceeding, which reduced the chieftain to the level of one of his own subordinate zamindars, met with the most strenuous opposition, and it was found impossible to continue governing on this principle. Sometimes by favour, but more often by force, the chieftains repossessed themselves of single villages, and adding one or two each year to their engagements, for the first time began to hold small estates exactly corresponding to the taluqas of to-day.\n\nA report from the tahsildar of Dalmau, dated 1809 A.D., gives a lively picture of the difficulties under which the revenue was collected. Din S\u00e1h, the zamindar of Gaura, had covered fifteen acres with a fort which he defended with two guns and a hundred matchlockmen. At his call Shiu Parsh\u00e1d Singh brought three hundred stout villagers from Shankarpur. Dalpat S\u00e1h of Chandania, and Fateh Singh of Samarpha, could between them raise a thousand men, and at the prospect of a fight the Kanhpuria zamindars trooped in from the N\u00e1in jungles; so that a levy of two thousand men could be raised at a moment's notice. By royal command the fort at Gaura was burnt, but the army had hardly turned its back when another rose from the smoking ruins, and the baffled official represents that the diabolical ingenuity of a wandering Englishman sug-\n\nhave seen instances in Gor\u00e1s where the Lucknow sanad has been confirmed in royal style by the Bisen r\u00e1j.\ngested the plan of the new gateway. Not only did this chief generally refuse to pay any revenue himself, but he rendered it impossible to collect in the neighbouring villages, by destroying the crops of zamindars who were more inclined to acquiesce. At one time he was caught and shut up in the Dalmau fort in consequence of a quarrel with the merchant who stood security for his villages, but he soon made his escape to the jungles, and it was found that he was a more intolerable nuisance as a proclaimed outlaw than he ever had been before, and he was brought back by the bribe of a village rent-free. To this he soon added eleven more, and after he had been cut down in the Dalmau kachahri in 1795 A.D., his brother, L\u00e1l S\u00e1h, and nephew, R\u00e1m Bakhsh, continued the same policy, and in 1810 A.D. engaged for 29 villages, 21 of which belonged to other zamindars, \"who,\" writes the tahsildar, \"still attend my kachahri in person, though I am obliged to let their villages remain in the Gaura engagement.\"\n\nThis report gives a tolerably faithful picture of the state of affairs throughout the district, officials attempting to collect direct, and resisted by chieftains who would not tolerate interference in their neighbourhood, and acquired by force an estate reckoned by single villages instead of their old general superintendence of a pargana, as their still older and still more vague supremacy within the limits of their r\u00e1j. The last twenty years of the eighteenth century saw the taluqa proper in its infancy; and it is not probable that it would ever have attained its present enormous development, but for the introduction of the contract system. The immediate effects of this both in enlarging the taluqas held by the ancient local chieftains, and in introducing strangers who were attracted by the position of landed proprietor, have already been described minutely and clearly in the chronicles of Oonao, and I need not go over the same ground again.\n\nIt is easier to discern the various revolutions which have taken place in their internal polity than to ascribe a beginning to the village communities. They seem to have originally consisted of a society of labourers, each in the possession of the lands in his immediate cultivation, and presided over by a leading member who collected and apportioned the incidence of the Government revenue. For these services he was remunerated by a light assessment on his peculiar holding, and the right to a due known in royal farm\u00e1s as muqaddami, which has perhaps survived in a number of forms to the present day. Within the reach of history there was probably no village in which more land had not accumulated in the hands of two or three influential families than they could till themselves without the help of tenants or hired labourers, still I am induced to believe that for some time after Akbar, villages in the exclusive proprietary possession of one non-cultivating family were the exception and not the rule.\n\nWhere villages were assigned to Chhattri zamindars, all the rights of the former cultivating proprietors rapidly disappeared. Even in villages not thus appropriated, the common and unrestrained right of sale favoured accumulation of property, and, on the principle that wealth gathers wealth, we often find that one rich family had become the sole proprietors, and, in imitation of their Rajput neighbours in the same position, assumed the title\nof zamindar. A third case was when the village was included in the taluqa before its acquisition of a zamindari body, and these are the villages in which we are told that the taluqdar is the sole zamindar.\n\nFor the first class of villages I take an instance from the Haidargarh pargana. About two hundred years ago the cadets of the Kumhr\u00e1-w\u00e1n r\u00e1j had to be provided for, and M\u00e1n Singh was assigned the village of Bhaw\u00e1n\u00edgarh. He found it occupied by a mixed community of Kurmis and Brahmans, whose rights he speedily extinguished, and his descendant, Qalandar Singh, is now in full proprietary possession of the village. The descendants of the heads of old society still retain the name of muqaddam, though it has ceased to have much meaning. A fair example of the second class is Katra Bah\u00e1durganj near Salon, a village famous under the king's rule for its panch\u00e1yats. The litigants were summoned before a board and stated their case; if it was not perfectly clear witnesses were dispensed with, and the parties separately consigned to solitary confinement and a meagre diet. It was seldom that many months elapsed before a deed of compromise released the prisoners, and rewarded the patience of the judges by a satisfactory settlement of the dispute. This village was sold in numerous small parcels by people of every caste, on deeds extending over fifty years, to the Sayyads of Salon. In the third case the muqaddams retained their title and collected the rents for their landlord instead of the Government. The retention of their rights depended chiefly on the proximity of the landlord, and in ordinary zamindari villages they had long altogether disappeared.\n\nGenerally the muqaddam had yielded to the zamindar, and again in most instances the zamindar to the taluqdar, but the village remained an integral unit in society, and the old rights left their traces on the most recent constitution.\n\nThe following is from the sepoy war touching the fights during the mutiny, 1857-58:\u2014\"On the morning of the 12th May I went to Nagar, and hearing that the enemy had taken up a position in force at Simri, five miles in an easterly direction, I started for that place the same afternoon. The weather was becoming fearfully hot; and to add to our discomfort, a duststorm was raging, accompanied by a hot wind. Nevertheless we came up to the position at 5 o'clock p.m., and found a strong force of the enemy, estimated at 1,500 infantry and 1,600 cavalry, with two guns posted along a nullah, with broken ground around, and a large jungle in their rear.\n\n\"Their cavalry was on our right flank, ready to pounce down on our baggage; but my mind was easy on this point, as I had left it some distance behind in a secure position, protected by 200 infantry, two guns, and a squadron of cavalry. The ball opened on our part with a shower of shot and shell. The Rifles and Sikhs were extended in skirmishing order, with the 38th and 9th in reserve, and covering the heavy guns. We soon cleared the nullah of the rebels, killing Amrathan Singh, a wealthy and influential taluqdar or landholder, and his brother, and taking two guns. The enemy were in full retreat, and as it was becoming dark, I throw out my pickets, and ordered the troops to bivouac.\"\n\"In the middle of the night we were suddenly awakened by a scream, followed by the thud of the hoofs of horses galloping about. We all supposed that the enemy's cavalry had broken in upon us favoured by the darkness, and a general commotion took place. A bullock-driver was killed, and Captain Gibbon* of the artillery was twice knocked down, finally wounding himself accidentally with his revolver. The Rifles also set to work in grim earnest, every one fighting against his neighbour, and breaking each other's heads with the butt-ends of their rifles. Fortunately at the time none happened to be loaded, or the loss would have been serious. As it turned out, ten or twelve men were sent to hospital. The alarm had been caused by a snake creeping over the face of a Madras sepoy, who terror-stricken started up with a scream. The confusion was then increased by several of our horses breaking loose and galloping about.\n\n\"The discomfort of having entire horses on a campaign is not to be told; and yet the Government of India have never had strength of mind to alter the system, though it has been denounced over and over again by every one competent to judge.\"\u2014Pages 273-275, \"The Sepoy War.\"\n\nAntiquities\u2014This district, as will be gathered from the historical sketch, presents many objects of interest to the antiquarian. The principal are found in the towns of Rae Bareli, Dalmau, and Jais. The forts of Rae Bareli and Dalmau are supposed to have belonged to the ancient Bhar chiefs, D\u00e1l and B\u00e1l, after whom they are named. The former is a vast quadrangular structure consisting of a high earthen mound which has been faced with brick. The gate is composed of huge bricks eighteen inches long by twelve thick; in one corner is a h\u00e1oli, a vast well about 35 feet in diameter, the sides have fallen in, but a good portion is still perfect, and it still contains water. In the interior are various buildings of no interest. The only local superstition appears to be the adoration of the manes of a poor Teli and his wife, who it is alleged were bricked up in the wall by the cruel barbarian Bhar chief who found his foundation giving way, and was told that they would not stand firm till a couple of Hindus were sacrificed. The legend is interesting as evidencing the popular belief that the Bhars were not of Arian descent.\n\nThere are no distinct traces of Buddhist origin about the fort except the bricks which probably belonged to some local shrine. Unlike the Dalmau fort, there is no elevated plateau inside.\n\nThere is a ditch outside, and the original design of the work is obviously for military purposes, of course it is possible that some prior structure may have been embraced in the circumvallation.\n\nJais is separately described.\n\nThe fort at Dalmau is an object of much more interest from several points of view. It is an irregular quadrangle with its base on the river forming one of the long sides; it might be more correctly described perhaps as shaped like a javelin head, with its point to the south-east, one\n\n* Now Colonel Gibbon, C.B.\nedge along the river, another to the east facing the ruins of the old town, and two short sides forming an advancing angle at the back. The two north-eastern sides are respectively 163 and 315 yards long, the other two are of nearly equal dimensions, and the entire circumference may be estimated at 900 yards or above half a mile. The corners however are advanced considerably, and the space is therefore circumscribed within by the retreating ramparts. The land sides particularly are almost crescent shaped, and good flanking fire could be kept up from the advancing angles on every part of the rampart. The defences consist of vast earthen mounds from 40 to 60 feet high and some hundreds of feet thick, for in point of fact, except at one break in the middle where a deep hollow extends right through from the river face, the fort consists of one immense artificial mound covering about eight acres, which was originally crowned with a wall, and appears to have been partially fenced with masonry all round.\n\nAt the south-east corner of the river face the masonry is still standing, the earth is cased with brickwork about four feet thick, and sloping at an angle of about 30 degrees to the ground; from this at a perpendicular height of about 40 feet the battlements rise wall within wall, each outer one acting as a buttress for that on the inside\u2014and the whole is crowned by a b\u0101rahd\u0101ri, or the place of twelve doors\u2014an open pavilion about one hundred feet above the river, to which at this point the descent is a sheer perpendicular.\n\nThe entire river face is scarped either by nature or the action of the water, to the land sides the slopes are more gradual, but still would be very difficult to escalade.\n\nIt does not appear as if this work was originally designed for military purposes; there is no ditch on the land side and never has been; it further appears on examination that the steep scarp in many places was replaced originally by terraced steps, some of which with their brick casings are still to be seen. The remains of wells, too, are found outside the defences, only one small and modern well is within the enclosure; the mass of earthwork also is quite beyond what would be required even to resist modern artillery, and for defence against the engines of medieval India exhibits an unaccountable prodigality of labour. It is apparent on inspection that the work is one of different ages; in several places the torrents of rain from the high plateau within have forced their way out, forming yawning rifts or ravines, on entering which it appears that considerably within the present outer line of circumvallation, there exists a brick wall of excellent material and fine work laid without lime resembling in all respects the early Buddhist work to be seen at Sarnath.\n\nThis wall appears to have been formerly all round the place; in some places it has been removed, on others the upper wall, which was formerly much higher than it appears at present, has tumbled down in vast masses forming a glaciis of mixed materials and concealing the ancient wall; the wall in fact has doubled over, and the inner casing of earth alone is visible. The interior is studded here and there with houses, mosques, and tombs of\nmasonry of very inferior workmanship; a fine gateway to the east is also of modern date, and largely composed of carved slabs square and column shaped, which formed a portion of some more ancient building. The carvings are partly buried in the brickwork, and architraves have been worked in upside down.\n\nIt would appear that this fort consists really of two of those great Buddhist vih\u0101ras on mounds which are still found at S\u00e1nchi, Amrit\u0101pur, and on the Haz\u0101ra frontier. These mounds were generally circular, and had a perpendicular casing of masonry which rose in terraces, while the top was shaped into a solid dome. They were accessible by stairs, supplied with balustrades, and used for the open, air ceremonies of the Buddhist faith.\n\nApparently two of these adjoined as was often the case; the original height was probably not less than 150 feet, a very mediocre elevation for these edifices. After the peaceful Buddhist period witnessed by Hwen Thsang expired, some military leader, R\u00e1ja D\u00e1l or his ancestor, seeing the advantage of the position connected the two mounds, probably lowering their height and forming the whole into a vast plateau with a hollow in the centre, which was not filled up to the original level.\n\nThis of course is mere conjecture; what seems certain is that the entire structure is an artificial one; the floods have laid low the very foundation, and at a depth of 60 feet from the surface, bricks and pottery pared away by the river, attest that the entire mass has been placed there by the hand of man. If so, this huge mound would have served no known purpose but that for which the Buddhist raised his tope, while the terraces, the brick plinth, and wall, the ancient carving, and numerous stone pillars, lintels, and balustrades, of types well known in Buddhist architecture, attest the same fact.\n\nThis mound, with its tottering pavilions and crumbling battlements, is perhaps the most picturesque object on the banks of the Ganges in Oudh. Nor is it without interest from a military point of view. The deep stream of the Ganges, the only navigable branch, flows under the overhanging battlement from which yearly it cuts a portion away. In the face of the cliff so formed are seen walls, floors, arches, and vaults, strangely carved blocks of stone protrude themselves, here and there appear large earthen jars, the latter probably used for some funeral purpose\u2014all seem thrown together in one chaotic compost. These fragments of the ancient buildings seen in vertical section are embedded in the clay, and present a strange medley of relics of the past; each year some structure probably 2,000 years old is unearthed by the river, is seen for a few months by the boatmen whose vessels pass underneath, and with the floods of the next moonsoon is again swept away or tumbles into the torrent.\n\nRAE BARELI Pargana\u2014Tahsil. RAE BARELI\u2014District RAE BARELI.\u2014This large pargana lies on both sides of the river Sai; it is bounded on the south by Dalmau, on the east by Salon and Rokha J\u00e9ia. It is twenty-five miles from north to south, and twenty-one from east to west. Its area\nis 371 square miles, divided into 363 villages, of which 283 are taluq-\ndari, 60 are zamindari, and 20 pattidari. The Government revenue is\nRs. 5,34,925, which falls at the rate of Rs. 2-4-0 per acre.\n\nThe pargana is said to have been called after R\u00e1\u00e9 B\u00e1\u00ed, a Bhar chieftain,\nbrother of D\u00e1l, who founded Dalmau; others state that it was named so\nbecause it was the capital of the Bhars. The headquarters of the pargana is\nR\u00e1hi, a place about three miles north of Rae Bareli, which was originally\ncalled Bharauli or Barauli. The great Bais R\u00e1ja, Tilok Chand, having no\nchildren of his own adopted his diw\u00e1n's son, N\u00e1bh R\u00e1\u00e9, a K\u00e1yath; he had\nsome time afterwards several natural children; he then provided for N\u00e1bh\nR\u00e1\u00e9 by giving him 178 villages-rent free. This happened in 1350 Sambat\n(A.D., 1293). N\u00e1bh R\u00e1\u00e9 founded the village Harchandpur calling it after his\nson, and fixed his residence there. His descendants divided into twenty-eight\nbranches who live in as many separate villages; these are therefore called\nthe \"Atthaisa\" K\u00e1yaths.\n\nThe Bhars are said to have risen again to power after the death of Tilok\nChand, and the Bais and K\u00e1yaths united several times contended with\nthem in battle. The Bhars were finally overthrown by Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Sharqi of\nJaunpur. Such is the tradition given in this pargana, which differs how-\never from those current elsewhere.\n\nThe Jaunpur sovereign divided the present pargana into four muh\u00e1ls or\ntappas\u2014R\u00e1hi, Bh\u00e1wan, Bachewan, Anguri. Akbar constituted the par-\ngana of Rae Bareli in Sark\u00e1r M\u00e1nikpur, and S\u00e1adat Ali Khan made the\nchakla of Bareli in the niz\u00e1mat of Baisw\u00e1ra.\n\nThe K\u00e1yath family already mentioned served the Bais chiefs for six\ngenerations as diw\u00e1ns, from the time of Abhai Chand to that of Tilok\nChand. Akbar made them chaudhr\u00eds and q\u00e1n\u00fangos of the pargana. Th\u00e1-\nkur Bijai Singh, Aurangzeb's diw\u00e1n, belonged to this family, and got the\ntitle of khw\u00e1ja from his master. These K\u00e1yaths are still called Th\u00e1kurs,\nbecause they are descended from R\u00e1ja Tilok Chand's adopted son, an\ninstructive fact; they style the Bais gentlemen of the pargana in familiar\ncorrespondence \"Bhayya S\u00e1hib,\" and are styled by them \"Th\u00e1kur\nS\u00e1hib.\" The present representatives of the family are the Q\u00e1n\u00fango,\nMajlis R\u00e1\u00e9, of Bareli, and Thakur\u00e1n Jogr\u00e1j Kunwar, Taluqdar of Har-\nd\u00e1sipur.\n\nThe entire population is 212,533, of whom 12,969 or six per cent. are\nMuhammadans. The Sai passes through the pargana, but is useless for\nirrigation as its channel is very deep. The river Naiya also passes through\nit to J\u00e1s. The Isoi, the Bas-ha, the Kharhi, the Baita, are all rivulets\nof this pargana and affluents of the Sai. The Baita rises in a lake near\nthe village Thulendi.\n\nThe land towards the east lies low, that to north-west and south is high;\nto the south the soil is sandy, elsewhere it is a good loam; towards the\nsouth irrigation is effected from tanks, the wells are not lasting; the\nclimate is tolerably good.\nMarkets are held every day in the principal town\u2014Bareli, Capperganj, Jah\u00e1abad, Darw\u00e1za Qila alias Pur\u00e1na bazar. The names and days on which the other bazars are held are tabulated thus:\n\n| Names of markets | Days on which held |\n|------------------|--------------------|\n| Sahdeoganj       | Sunday and Wednesday. |\n| Saray\u00e1n in village Sar\u00e1c D\u00e1mu | Ditto. |\n| Shamahorganj in village Khatw\u00e1ra | Ditto. |\n| Bishn\u00e1thganj in village Rahwa | Sunday and Thursday. |\n| Gauriganj in Hard\u00e1spur | Saturday and Tuesday. |\n| Gurbakhshganj in Ulush | Ditto. |\n| Aseha            | Ditto. |\n| R\u00e9hi             | Ditto. |\n| Bela J\u00e1nki       | Monday and Friday. |\n| Husenganj in Kas\u00far | Sunday and Wednesday. |\n| Hanom\u00e1nganj in Bela Bhela | Ditto. |\n| R\u00e1mganj in Indohar | Ditto. |\n| Rop\u00e1man          | Tuesday and Friday. |\n| Bela Khar        | Saturday and Wednesday. |\n| Ganeshganj in Bih\u00e1rpur | Tuesday and Friday. |\n| Munshiganj in Garhi Mitall | Sunday and Thursday. |\n\nOf all these markets that of Capperganj and of Munshiganj only need mention. Capperganj was built by Mr. W. C. Capper, C.S., while he was the Deputy Commissioner of this place. The market is four-sided and stands on the roadside, and contains about a hundred masonry built shops. Almost every kind of commodity is bought there; English articles are for the most part imported from Cawnpore and Fatehpur via the Ganges near the Dalmau Gh\u00e1t. Metal plates, goblets, and drinking cups are brought in from Hasanpur Bandhua, a place famous for them in district Sultanpur, country cloth from J\u00e1s, vegetables and fruit from Lucknow.\n\nThe second Munshiganj, or more properly D\u00edw\u00e1nganj, was built by Diw\u00e1n Chandi Sah\u00e1e, brother to Munshi Gur Sah\u00e1e, K\u00e1yath, noblemen of Lucknow. These two brothers were the assistants to the prime minister, Nawab Ali Naqi Khan of Oudh. The ganj stands on the metalled road from Bareli to Dalmau about two miles south of the former.\n\nHanom\u00e1nganj and Husenganj are the principal cattle markets; at the latter fifty or sixty head are sold generally every market day; the price of a good pair is Rs. 100. The cattle merchants give long credit; if the purchaser does not meet his engagement at the appointed date, the seller and all his brother dealers assemble and demand to be fed by the defaulter till he makes good the price.\n\nThere are two fairs held in the town of Bareli, each attended by ten or twelve thousand people. One termed the R\u00e1ml\u00edla about the middle of October, the other in the Muharram. A fair is held on the Queen\u2019s birthday at the village Chaul\u00e1mau near the tank of Diw\u00e1n Rewti R\u00e1m.\n\nSaltpetre and salt were formerly manufactured in above 50 villages, and the annual outturn was 6,000 maunds of salt and 1,300 saltpetre; this has been stopped since annexation. The principal landholders of this district\nare Bais Chhattirs, but the principal of them, R\u00e9na Beni M\u00e9dho, lost all his estates in the mutiny. The Bais are not however very ancient landholders; they came to this pargana about 1090 A.H., just at the close of Alamgir's reign.\n\nRae Bareli is mentioned in the Ain-i-Akbari as belonging to the Kanhpuria who spread hither from the adjoining pargans of Jais and Salon. The original habitat of the Bais was Daundia Kheri now in Unao.\n\nRAE BARELI\u2014Pargana Rae Bareli\u2014Tahsil Rae Bareli\u2014District Rae Bareli.\u2014This town lies in latitude 26\u00b014' north, longitude 81\u00b017' east, forty-eight miles south-east of Lucknow, thirty miles north of Fatehpur, North-Western Provinces, 52 miles north-west of Partabgarh, and 56 miles due west of Sultanpur. It was founded by Bhars, and after them called Bharauli, altered afterwards to Bareli. Some say that it is called Rae Bareli from Rahi, a town three miles from Bareli, the original headquarters of the pargana.\n\nA third account attributes the name to its having long been in possession of Kayaths generally called rae.* Husen Shah, the king of Jaunpur, changed the name to Husenabad, but the novelty was not lasting. It is the headquarters of the pargana, tahsil, district, and division, bearing the same name.\n\nIt is pleasantly situated on the river Sai, here spanned by a fine bridge; the picturesque temples and minarets of the old town are now rather in decay, but the huge crenelated battlements and gateways still rise grandly above the rich crops.\n\nThe town was handed over to Shekhs and Sayyads in 820 Hijri by Sultan Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Sharqi after he had killed B\u00e1\u00ed, the Bhar chief, said to be the eponymous hero of the place. In 1040 Hijri, during the reign of Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n, Subahdar Nawab Jahan Khan, Path\u00e1n, founded Jah\u00e1nabad in the village of Ikhtiy\u00e1rpur; this has always been considered a muhalla or ward of Bareli.\n\nThe town flourished, as it was always reckoned the healthiest spot in the district or the neighbourhood. Different muhallas or wards were founded at different times, and the descendants of the founders still are proprietors. Muhallas Qasb\u00e1na, Neza And\u00e1z, Sayyad R\u00e1jan, B\u00e1ns Tola, Pirai H\u00e1mid, were founded by Musalmans; Jaunpuri, Kh\u00e1l\u00ed Sah\u00e1t, Suri\u00fapur by Brahmins; Khatrauni Khurd and Kal\u00e1n by Khattri treasurers of the Jaunpur kings; Shah Tola by the king's purveyor. The sovereign erected in 820 Hijri (A.D. 1403), a very spacious and strong fort; this was probably made with bricks belonging to still more ancient buildings; they are two feet long, one foot thick, one and a half wide.\n\nAn ancient b\u00e1oli yawns in the centre; this is a huge circular tank or well dug down to the springs and then lined with brick walls, supporting balconies and containing chambers on a level with the water. This one is 108 yards in circumference, and when in good repair must have been a pleasant retirement in the hot weather.\n\n* Page 69, \"Ellott's Chronicles of Oomao.\"\nTradition relates that when the fort was building, whatever was erected during the day fell down in the ensuing night. After some days of such futile labour, the king called for the holy saint Makhdu'm Sayyad J\u00e1'fri from Jaunpur; his holy footsteps trod the precincts, and no more interruption was given to the work. The saint's tomb is beside the gate of the fort.\n\nThe magnificent tomb and palace, Rang Mahal of Nawab Jah\u00e1n Khan, adorn the suburb of Jah\u00e1nabad. During the reign of Shuj\u00e1-ud-daula, when the Mahrattas were hovering round trying to invade Oudh, a number of the degenerate nobles were so terrified that they took up their residence inside the fort, and built themselves houses in which descendants still reside.\n\nSince annexation a fine masonry bridge of five arches, twenty-eight feet broad, has been constructed over the Sai; the work was inaugurated by Mr. W. Glynn, the late Deputy Commissioner; the expense (Rs. 36,000) was defrayed by a subscription of the taluqdar. A fine idg\u00e1h or assembly room for the Id festival was built by Shekh Najaf Ali Khan, the money being subscribed by the Musalmans of the neighbourhood.\n\nSeveral tanks also have been made since annexation; so although the residents may not be so wealthy as they were in former times, they put their means to better use.\n\nThe population is 11,544, of whom Bareli proper contains 6,542 and Jah\u00e1nabad 5,002. The Muhammadan population consists of 2,446 Sunnis, and 40 Shias. Notwithstanding, an order had to be passed forbidding the latter to bring their t\u00e1zias in procession past the houses of the much more numerous Sunnis. Most of the Hindus are low castes, there being only 372 Brahmins.\n\nSahdeo Singh and Gul\u00e1b Singh, Sikhs, have a number of followers who reside in the town. The former is the grandson of Mah\u00e1raja Ranjit Singh, the ruler of the Punjab; the latter was one of his generals; they are in honourable banishment and have got estates here.\n\nThere are four fine mosques, besides others of less note, and 337 masonry houses. The J\u00e1ma Masjid was built by Sultan Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Sharqi of Jaunpur, and repaired in 1089 A.H. by the emperor \u00c1lamg\u00edr. The second great mosque was built in 1040 A.H. by Nawab Jah\u00e1n Khan. The third by Shah \u00c1lam-ulla; it has no domes, but three spacious halls, and is a copy of the K\u00e1ba at Mecca. The fourth mosque is in the suburb D\u00e1ira, and was built by a son of Shah \u00c1lam-ulla. Two Hindu temples, one to Mah\u00e1deo and one to Mah\u00e1b\u00edr, suffice for the less fervent devotions of the Hindus.\n\nThere are two schools, one with 150 pupils, the other a Christian Mission school with 70. A dispensary and a caravan-serai, built since annexation by R\u00e9ja Digbijai Singh, are also features of the place; the former stands on the site of another mosque built by Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Shah at the gate of the fort; thus the ancient king intimated that he trusted for the defence of his realm to the God without whom his walls were vain. This evidence of his devotion has now given place to drugs.\nThere are three market places\u2014one built by Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Sharqi known as \"Qile-ki-baz\u00e1r,\" one Jah\u00e1nabad, and the third Capperganj, erected by Mr. W. C. Capper, C.S., the late Deputy Commissioner. The market in the latter is a daily one.\n\nThere are two fairs\u2014one the Dasahra of the Hindus, the other, the Muharram for the Musalmans; each is attended by about twelve thousand people. It will be observed from the following table that the sales in the daily and weekly markets reach the amount of Rs. 1,181 daily. This will be above Rs. 4,00,000 annually. English cloth commands, it appears, a larger sale than native:\n\n| Name of articles                  | Quantity | Value |\n|----------------------------------|----------|-------|\n| **Town Daily Markets**           |          |       |\n| 1.

There was a great fight here between the taluqdars of Dhingwas and Bhadri; 100 men were killed. The population consists of 4,008 Hindus and 315 Musalmans. There is one mosque and three temples to Mah\u00e1deo, and a small bazar.\n\nRAHMNAGAR PANDI\u00c1W\u00c1N.\u2014Pargana Bijnaur\u2014Tahsil Lucknow\u2014District Lucknow.\u2014Rahimnagar Pandi\u00e1w\u00e1n is the chief of a group of 12 villages belonging to P\u00e1nde Brahmins, situated on the right bank of the Sai on the southern boundary of the Bijnaur pargana. The village is purely agricultural and chiefly inhabited by Hindus. But as its name imports, has some pretensions to be called a Muhammadan settlement. There is a family of Path\u00e1ns living in a hamlet of the village called Ballochgarhi, who assert their original right to the soil, which had been conferred on them in j\u00e1gir by the emperors of Delhi, but which when the right was confiscated by Sa\u00e1dat Ali Khan, 7th Nawab of Oudh, was conferred on the Brahmins.\n\nBrahmins are known to have colonized parts of this pargana, and it is more likely that kept under for a time, they were at length able successfully to assert their right. The population is 2,500, and there are 407 houses, all of which are mud-built. A small Government school has been established here, but is not at present much appreciated by the people.\n\nThe cultivation in this and the neighbouring villages is very fine.\n\nRAMIA BIHAR.\u2014Pargana Dhaurahra\u2014Tahsil Nigh\u00e1s\u00e1n\u2014District Kh\u00e9ri.\u2014This village is beautifully situated on the north side of an ancient channel of the Kauri\u00e1la (this is now closed up and forms a lake). There are splendid groves to the east and west.\n\nRamia Bih\u00e1r has a market in which articles of country consumption are sold. The average annual sale of cotton fabrics is estimated at Rs. 200. It belongs to R\u00e1ja Indra Bikram S\u00e1h, Taluqdar of Khairigarh.\n\n| Population | Males | Females |\n|------------|-------|---------|\n| Hindus     | 741   | 611     |\n| Muhammadan | 76    | 58      |\n\nR\u00c1MKOT Pargana*\u2014Tahsil Sitapur\u2014District Sitapur.\u2014R\u00e1mkot is a very small pargana, lying close to Sitapur on the south-west; on the south it is bounded by pargana Machhrehta, in the west by Misrikh, and on the east by Khairabad, from which it is separated by the Sar\u00e1yan stream. Its area is 20 square miles, of which 11 only are cultivated. The average is as follows:\n\n- 7,336 cultivated\n- 3,500 culturable\n- 66 rent-free\n- 1,681 barren\n\nAssessed.\n\nUnassessed.\n\n*By Mr. M. L. Ferrar, C.S., Assistant Commissioner.\nThe population of 8,791 is thus distributed:\n\n| Hindus, agricultural | ... | ... | ... | 5,068 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \" non-agricultural | ... | ... | ... | 3,532 |\n| Musalmans, agricultural | ... | ... | ... | 38 |\n| \" non-agricultural | ... | ... | ... | 158 |\n\nagainst 1\u00b74 of an acre of cultivated land per head of agricultural population there are 2\u00b71 acres of culturable land.\n\nThe pargana is, indeed, in a very backward condition; its present proprietors, Janw\u00e1r Rajputs, having done nothing for it since annexation, and in this they contrast very unfavourably with their predecessor Hardeo Bakhsh (see town R\u00e1mkot), who did so much for the property. The present proprietors are his two sons, K\u00e1lka Bakhsh and Ganga Bakhsh, and they own the entire pargana (R\u00e1mkot), which consists of 12 demarcated villages.\n\nWith the exception of the very fine tanks in R\u00e1mkot itself, there is no structure in the whole pargana deserving of notice.\n\nThe Hindus are distributed thus: Brahmans 1,367, Rajputs 361, Beni\u00e1ns 337, Ah\u00edrs 899, P\u00e1s\u00eds 665, Cham\u00e1rs 1,157, and the whole population lives in 1,343 houses, each of which thus contains on average 5\u00bd individuals. There are 489 to the square mile. The Musalmans are only 2\u00b72 per cent. of the entire population, and are all of a humble rank in life, Jul\u00e1hs principally.\n\nThe incidence of the revised revenue falls as follows:\n\n| Description       | Rs. a. p. |\n|-------------------|-----------|\n| On uncultivated area | 1 10 9    |\n| On assessed area   | 1 2 0     |\n| On total           | 0 15 7    |\n\nThe history as given by the oldest inhabitants is as follows:\u2014When R\u00e1m Chandar was on his pilgrimage, he sojourned on the spot where now stands R\u00e1mkot. Here he founded a fort, the remains of which are extant in the form of a dh\u00ed (mound) to the present day. But R\u00e1m went on in his pilgrimage, and the place decayed. Subsequently a tribe of Kachhers acquired the district, and held it down to 1707 A.D., when they were dispossessed by the ancestor of the present taluqdars, and his descendants have held it ever since. The history of the pargana is the history of the town, to which the reader is referred.\n\nHardeo Bakhsh abovementioned did a good deal for the pargana. He made roads, planted avenues, dug wells, and caused the increase of cultivation. On his death in 1842 A.D. his widow succeeded him, and she managed the estate for her two infant sons, K\u00e1lka Bakhsh and Ganga Bakhsh, with prudence and success down to her death in 1853. After that\nthe chakladar oppressed her sons, and for the three years preceding annexation they were quite unable to do anything for the property, which accordingly was found in a very poor condition in 1856. The taluqdars behaved loyally in the mutiny, for which good conduct they received a reward.\n\nThe physical features of the pargana resemble those of its neighbour Sitapur. A dead level, well wooded and producing good crops. There are no mines, quarries, or manufactures beyond the ordinary coarse country cloth, which is made in every chief town of a pargana. The only mela celebrated is that described in town R\u00e1mkot. The rents are entirely paid in kind, the exceptions being the rent of the lands which produce tobacco, sugar, &c. Water is found at a maximum depth of 26 feet from the surface of the earth.\n\nR\u00c1MKOT*\u2014Pargana R\u00c1MKOT\u2014Taheil SITAPUR\u2014District SITAPUR.\u2014R\u00e1mkot is seven miles south-west of Sitapur, the high road from which place to Hardoi passes through it. It is said to have been founded by the great R\u00e1m Chandar during his pilgrimage, and to have derived its name, \"The castle of R\u00e1m,\" from him. The present town is a poor place, consisting entirely of mud-built houses. The census of 1869 puts the number of inhabitants down at 1,977. Its present owners are Chhatris of the clan Janw\u00e1r, whose ancestors acquired it vi et armis in the civil wars of 1707 A.D., the former proprietors, who were Kachheras, having been expelled by them.\n\nThe town as it at present exists, though entirely mud-built, is erected on an ancient dh\u016b (mound), the remains of a former town in which the houses were mostly of burnt bricks. The only notable structure in the place is a very handsome masonry tank with a Shiw\u00e1la, &c., built 70 years ago by Hardeo Bakhsh, father of the present taluqdar, which is not only deemed holy by the Hindus of the locality, but is also a place of favourite resort of the Europeans of Sitapur. The only public building in the town is the school attended by 55 scholars.\n\nThere is a bazar held twice a week, and at the Diw\u00e1li festival a mela or fair, of no great magnitude, takes place at the tanks abovementioned. Besides the road to Sitapur, R\u00e1mkot is connected by good unmetalled roads with Hardoi through Qutubnagar, and with Misrikh and Nimkh\u00e1r.\n\nThe annual value of the bazar sales is Rs. 14,400. There are no manufactures of any kind. The camping ground is good; and in the neighbourhood of the place are several avenues of trees planted by the same Hardeo Bakhsh who built the tank and temple above described.\n\nR\u00c1MNAGAR Pargana\u2014Taheil FATEHPUR\u2014District BARA BANKI.\u2014This pargana is bounded on the north by the Chauka, on the east by pargana Bado Sarai, on the south by the Kaly\u00e1ni, and on the west by Fatehpur. Its area is 112 square miles or 71,716 acres, of which 50,732 are cultivated. The irrigated land amounts to 11,080 acres, and the unirrigated to 39,652.\n\n* By Mr. M. L. Ferrar, C.S., Assistant Commissioner.\nThe Chauka flows on the north, and the Kalyani on the south; the latter has a course of 9, and the former of 8 miles within this pargana. The metalled road to Bahramghat and that from Fyzabad to Sitapur and Kheri pass through it. Bahramghat is a great timber market. Schools have been established at Ramnagar, Mahadewa, Ganeshpur, Tilokpur, Suratganj, and Amoti Kalan. The post-offices are at Ganeshpur and Ramnagar. There is also a police station and a registry office at Ramnagar. Two considerable fairs are held at Lodhaura in Aghan and Phagun in honour of Sri Lodheswar Mahadeo. The land revenue amounts to Rs. 68,505-12-8, falling at the rate of Re. 1-10-8 per arable acre; the number of villages in this pargana is 168. They are held under the following tenures:\n\n| Taluqdari | Zamindari | Pattidari |\n|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n|           |           |           |\n|           |           |           |\n\nThe population amounts to 80,686, of which higher castes number 25,000. Some of the lower castes\u2014e.g., Ahirs (6,726), Lodhs (3,729)\u2014are very numerous. The pargana was in the Nawabi called Sailuk. The town of Ramnagar was founded on the land of Keshwamau by Ram Singh, ancestor of Raja Sarabjit Singh, the present taluqdar. For the history of Ramnagar Dhameri, which is the same as that of the pargana, see article Bhitauli pargana. The principal landlord is Raja Sarabjit Singh of Ramnagar Dhameri.\n\n**Ramnagar\u2014Pargana Ramnagar\u2014Tahsil Fatehpur\u2014District Bara Banki.**\u2014This town is situated about 19 miles from Nawabganj and four from Bahramghat on the Gogra, and is the seat of a thana and branch dispensary. There was a tahsil, but it has lately been removed to Fatehpur; the surrounding country is rich and well wooded, and forms part of the Ramnagar Dhameri taluqa.\n\nThe present proprietor is Raja Sarabjit Singh, a Raikwar Chhattri. His father, Raja Gur Bakhsh Singh, is still alive and dwells at Ramnagar. In the Nawabi Gur Bakhsh was a man of some importance, and lived in a chronic state of war with the Government. He had a strong fort at Bhitauli at the apex of the Duab of the Gogra and Chauka rivers to which he retired when pressed for Government revenue. Sleeman says that he used to pay Rs. 2,00,000 a year for his estate. See article Bhitauli.\n\nThe total population amounts to 5,717, of which the Musalmans are 909 and the Hindus 4,808, higher castes 1,469, houses 1,308.\n\nLatitude 27\u00b05' north, longitude 81\u00b028' east.\n\n**Rampur Pargana\u2014Tahsil Kunda\u2014District Partabgarh.**\u2014This large pargana extends from the river Sai on the north almost to the Ganges on the south; its area is 179 square miles, of which 79 are cultivated; the population is 77,572, which is 433 to the square mile. Of this population 4,223 are Chattars, of which body two individuals, the Rajas of Rampur, Bisen, and Kaithaula, Kanhpuria, hold the entire pargana besides many\nvillages in others. Brahmins who number 12,597 are the most numerous and intelligent. The account of the Bisens told by themselves may be given. It is evident, however, that it contains only the element of truth. Unlike the Dikhits, the Sombansi of Partabgarh, and the Bais, the Bisens, at least as a ruling family, are of very modern origin; as a clan they were powerful. The qanungo's relation is that they were merely chauthris, Government officers drawing fees from this jurisdiction till the general break up of the Musalman empire after the death of Aurangzeb, then they gave up office and acquired an estate. But it is quite evident that, whatever may have been the case with the present great family, the Bisen clan held this pargana and others, for they are mentioned as the owners in the Ain-i-Akbari. The fact that they had no raja, till 20 years ago, and that a younger scion of the family, that of Bedri, was made a rao about 1800 A.D., is a proof that the feudal lordship claimed by the Rampur family never existed save in the fertile imagination of the bards. It is alleged that the head of the family was called rae till Khushal Singh, grandfather of the present incumbent, got the title of rae from Raja Bahadur Singh of Partabgarh, a sufficient proof of the subordinate position of the family.\n\nBut the title of lal is much lower than that of rae, so the Rampur chief can never have exchanged the latter for the former. In point of fact lal was the first title, possibly, as the qanungos say, the head of the family was formerly called chaudhri.\n\nThe present head of the family is one of the most chivalrous and liberal-minded gentlemen in Oudh; he has been generally in opposition to the Government of the day, and has only found peace since annexation. He built his great fort of Kalkankar in 1246 fasli (A.D. 1839) thirty-four years ago. He surrounded it with a canal from the Ganges, that the waters of the sacred stream might be round about him by day and by night. In 1247 he defended his fort at Dharpur for nine days against the great Nazim Darshan Singh. In 1256, during a short glimpse of court sunshine, the title of raja was conferred upon him by Wajid Ali Shah. In 1260 he again fought the Nazim; was besieged in Kalkankar for 57 days; meanwhile he escaped from the fort, and, disguised it is said as a female of rank, he fled to Lucknow to get help from the resident; finding no resource there, he abandoned the fort and fled to the Sujakhar jungles in Partabgarh north of the Sai. The family history is thus given in settlement report:\u2014\n\"The present taluqdar families of the Bisen clan all trace their origin to H\u00fam, whose posterity are shown in the subjoined table:\u2014\n\n**R\u00c1E H\u00daM.**\n\n- **Purandar R\u00e1e.** (P\u00farb\u00e1ra village)\n- **R\u00e1e Gop\u00e1l.** (Gop\u00e1lipura.)\n- **R\u00e1e R\u00e9gho.** (R\u00e1ghopur and R\u00e9epur)\n\n---\n\n**R\u00e1e Askaran,** K\u00e1shi, (R\u00e1mpur) il\u00e1ga.

I may narrate however their uprising against Jiu R\u00e1m N\u00e1g\u00e1r, a n\u00e1zm of the Bani\u00e1n caste, whose headquarters were at M\u00e1nikpur. This official attempted to introduce a settlement of the land revenue with villagers (as did our Government in 1856), but this so incensed the Bisens that they rose as one man, attacked the n\u00e1zm at M\u00e1nikpur and killed him. This was 1155 fasli or 1748 A.D., in the time of Safdar Jang. A trophy of the fight is still preserved in the Kundraj\u00edt family in the shape of a pair of drums which belonged to the n\u00e1zm, and which are now called 'Ranj\u00edt' or 'won in battle.'\n\n\"The R\u00e1mpur estate.\u2014The R\u00e1mpur family assert that their ancestor, Bh\u00e1o Singh, held the parganas of Salon, M\u00e1nikpur, Dhera-cum-Dhingwas,\n\n---\n\n*This is the story currently reported; but there is no historical foundation for it, and moreover in the year 1748 A.D., the Sark\u00e1r of M\u00e1nikpur was not included in Oudh, and certainly was under no Hindu Governor until after A.D. 1762.*\nand the Kaithaula estate. In the time of Mans\u00far Ali Khan (Safdar Jang) they lost this after a siege of their fort of R\u00e1mpur. There is an old feud between them and the Kaithaula estate, which lies in the R\u00e1mpur pargana, and has been at various times the object of their cupidity. Several fights occurred, and the Kanhpuras of Kaithaula have had hard work to maintain themselves in the vicinity of their powerful and not over-scrupulous neighbours.\n\n\"R\u00e1ja Hanwant Singh.\u2014The present R\u00e1ja Hanwant Singh has fought both with and against the n\u00e1zims at various times. His estate was held 'kh\u00e1m' in 1242, 1243-4, and again in 1248 fasli, owing to his unruly opposition to the authorities. In 1260 fasli, the N\u00e1zim, Khan Ali Kh\u00e1n, beat him out of his two forts of K\u00e1l\u00e1k\u00e1nkar and Dh\u00e1r\u00fapur, and his estate was not only 'kh\u00e1m' but laid waste. From his fort of K\u00e1l\u00e1k\u00e1nkar, which is on the banks of the Ganges, a British steamer proceeding to Cawnpore during the mutiny was fired on. His son, Part\u00e1b Singh, took an active part in opposing the re-occupation of Oudh, and was killed at Chanda in Sultanpur in an action with Colonel Wroughton's force. An account of this taluqdar and his tactics may be found in the book called 'Dacoitee in Excelsis,' pages 124-5-6. He is a very good specimen of the Nawabi taluqdar, and perhaps too good a one to be taken as an average, or as a representative of his order, being a most courteous and kind hearted man, intelligent, frank, and honest. The old Adam of the taluqdar pur et simple is however distinguishable in the manner in which he likes to have his own way in his estate and resents opposition. We cannot expect it to be otherwise, and may be well content if we get many taluqdars like him. He has had the chronicles of his family done into Urdu verse by a domestic poet, Muhammad Asghar, familiarly known as 'Ust\u00e1dj\u00ed.' This work called 'Bisen Sabha,' or the 'Court of the Bisens,' has been printed, and a copy may be got by the curious in such matters.\"\n\nFurther account of the Bisens.\u2014In his chronicles of Unao, Mr. C. A. Elliott mentions the Bisen as having, with the Gahrw\u00e1r and Bhandel, settled in that district in the pre-historic period. In another place he records that \"the Bisens came from Salempur Majhauli in the Gorakhpur district, and pushed westward to M\u00e1nikpur, and that the Unao branch is an offshoot from M\u00e1nikpur.\" Mr. P. Carnegy places this clan amongst those of the Rajputs, \"who are avowedly descended from deified Brahmans, who are styled Rikhs, and their offspring as Rikhbans, literally the children of the saint.\" Mr. Carnegy's further remarks regarding this Bisen clan may with advantage be here introduced.*\n\n\"These people have already been mentioned as descended from a devotee Mewar Bh\u00e1t. What their claim may be to being placed under the Sombans line is not quite clear. Their avowed chief is the R\u00e1ja of Majhauli in Gorakhpur. In Oudh we have no less than thirteen chiefs of this clan, and their colonies are principally to be found in the Partabgarh district, but also in Bahraich, Gonda, Dariabad, and Sultanpur. The local heads of the family are R\u00e1ja Hanwant Singh of K\u00e1l\u00e1k\u00e1nkar, as fine a\n\n* Notes on the Races, Tribes, and Castes of Oudh, by Mr. P. Carnegy, page 49.\nspecimen of the oriental yeoman as is to be found anywhere, and one who will ever be respected by our countrymen for the asylum he offered to the officers of his district in the rebellion; and also the R\u00e1jas of Manikapur and Bhinga. Sir Henry Elliot affirms that the present R\u00e1ja of Majhauti is in the hundred and fifteenth generation from Mewar Bhat, the devotee. The Oudh branch state that they broke off from the parent stem in the person of R\u00e1e H\u00fam, and settled in the province under the wing of M\u00e1nik Chand, the then powerful Gahrw\u00e1r R\u00e1ja of M\u00e1nikpur; he who so happily picked up the foundling mother of all the Kanhpuria clan. Within the last three years the present R\u00e1ja of Majhuli took to himself a wife from the R\u00e1jkum\u00e1r house of Dera, a sure indication that the Bisens (indigenous devotee Chhattis of Gorakhpur though they be) are higher in the social scale than the R\u00e1jkum\u00e1r offshoot of the Mainpuri ex-convert Chauh\u00e1ns.\"\n\nEarliest Bisens settlement in the Partabgarh district.\u2014The Bisens first settled in this district in the time of M\u00e1nik Chand, some few years prior to 590 Hijri (A.D. 1193). Their earliest settlement was Badg\u00e1wan in pargana Dhingwas. For three generations they do not seem to have made much way, or to have much enlarged their possessions. In the fourth generation from R\u00e1e H\u00fam, their pioneer settler, R\u00e1e R\u00e1gho, appears to have made friends with the Gardezis of M\u00e1nikpur, and from them to have obtained twelve villages, with headquarters at Derwa. The place was selected on a jungle site, as being on the borders of the Sombansi territory, and a convenient and suitable spot for repelling those raids to which the Sombansis were formerly so much addicted, and which were so frequently the cause of embroiling them with the Government officials. These twelve villages were the nucleus of the subsequent extended possessions of the Bisen clan. The R\u00e1mpur family has always been the most powerful of the Bisen taluqdars, amongst whom may be prominently mentioned Dh\u00e1r\u00fa S\u00e1h, R\u00e1e Shi\u00e1m Singh, R\u00e1e Sangr\u00e1m Singh, R\u00e1e Bh\u00e1o Singh, R\u00e1e Khush\u00e1l Singh, R\u00e1e Balwant Singh, L\u00e1l Bair\u00e1s\u00ed Singh, and L\u00e1l Hanwant Singh (now known as R\u00e1ja Hanwant Singh).\n\nThe Bisen clan in the district of Partabgarh numbers three thousand (vide census); but of these only a portion belong to the blood of R\u00e1e N\u00e1m; the larger number belong to another line; they claim to be descended from a brother of R\u00e1e N\u00e1m's; the taluqdar's line declares that they are bastards; there is no commensality or friendship even between the two, and the inferior order has been rather severely treated in the matter of its landed tenures.\n\nOf the pure Bisen nine men hold between them six taluqas embracing 532 villages; 20 zamindari villages and 54 sub-settlements are divided among the rest of the brotherhood, at least among its heads.\n\nThe Bisen clan is a very weak one compared to the Sombansi, the Kanhpuria, or the Bachgoti; the connexion of R\u00e1mpur with Kaithaula, and the ancient position of the Bisen clan towards the M\u00e1nikpur lords, are points for inquiry in future.\nThe following extract from Sleeman* refers more properly to Bih\u00e1r, but is given here as shedding light upon the position of the Bisen:\n\n\"The Bhuderee family give their daughters in marriage to the Bugheela Rajas of Rewa and the Powar Rajas of Ocheyra, who are considered to be a shade higher in caste than they are among the Rajpoots. Not long ago they gave one hundred thousand rupees, with one daughter, to the only son of the Rewa Raja, as the only condition on which he would take her. Golab Sing, the brother of Seoruttun Sing, of Pertabghur, by caste a Sombunsee, is said to have given lately fifty thousand rupees, with another daughter, to the same person; Raja Hunmunt Sing, of Dharoopoor, who is by caste a Beseyn Rajpoot, the year before last went to Rewa accompanied by some fifty Brahmins, to propose an union between his daughter and the same son of the Rewa R\u00e1ja. A large sum was demanded, but he pleaded poverty, and at last got the R\u00e1ja to consent to take fifty thousand rupees down, and seventy-five thousand at the last ceremony of the barat or fetching home of the bride. When all had been prepared for this last ceremony, the Raja of Rewa pleaded the heat of the weather, and his son would not come to complete it, and take away his bride. Hunmunt Sing collected one hundred resolute Brahmins, and proceeded with them to Rewa, where they sat dhurna at the raja's door, without tasting food, and declared that they would all die there unless the marriage was completed.\n\n\"The Raja did all he could, or could make his people do, to get rid of them; but at last, afraid that some of the Brahmins would really die, he consented that his son should go and fetch his bride if Hunmunt Sing would pay down twenty-five thousand rupees more, to defray the cost of the procession, in addition to the seventy-five thousand. He did so, and his daughter was taken off in due form. He has another daughter to dispose of in the same way. The Rewa R\u00e1ja has thus taken five or six wives for his son from families a shade lower in caste; but the whole that he has got with them will not be enough to pay one of the Rajpoot families, a shade higher in caste than he is in Rajpootana, to take one daughter from him. It costs him ten or twelve lacs of rupees to induce the R\u00e1ja of Oudeepoor, Joudhpoor, or Jypoor, to take away as his bride a daughter of Rewa. All is a matter of bargain and sale. Those who have money must pay, in proportion to their means, to marry their daughters into families a shade higher in caste or dignity, or to get daughters from them when such families are reduced to the necessity of selling their daughters to families of a lower grade.\"\n\nR\u00c1MPUR MATHURA\u2020\u2014Pargana KUNDRI (SOUTH)\u2014Tahsil B\u00c1RI\u2014District SITAPUR.\u2014R\u00e1mpur Mathura is 44 miles across country from Sitapur to the south-east, and is but one mile to the east of the river Chauka, and three miles west of the Gogra, both of which rivers are navigable throughout the year, and afford good water communication to the inhabitants of the surrounding district.

It is a very sinuous stream, and it is continually changing its course; but it flows in a deep channel confined by high banks, and only in more than ordinarily wet seasons overflows its banks to any great extent. These overflows, however, are sufficiently frequent to keep the alluvial soil of the villages within their range fresh and productive.\n\nThe dry weather discharge of this river is 900 feet* per second.\n\nThe following very correct extract from Thornton is given here for convenience of reference:\n\n\"Rapti, called also Airawati, after the white elephant of the god Indra, a considerable river rising in Naip\u00e1l.

There is no jungle near. There are some mahua and mango groves which yield abundantly.\n\nThere are two market days in each week, but the bazar is not a place of much resort. There is no school in the village, but the children attend the village school at Th\u00e1na, which is not quite two miles off.\n\n* By Mr. Hoey, C.S., Assistant Commissioner.\nR\u00c1WATPUR\u2014Pargana DAUNDIA KHERA\u2014Tahsil PURWA\u2014District UNAO.\u2014Lies 16 miles south of the tahsil, and 28 miles south-east from the civil station of Unao.\n\nIt was founded by R\u00e1wat Singh, Bais, about 400 years ago. This R\u00e1wat Singh was a distinct individual from the ancestor of B\u00e1bu R\u00e1m Bakhsh. It takes its name from its founder. The soil is loam and clay. It presents a pleasing prospect. The water is fresh. Site on level ground. Climate healthy. No jungle. Groves here and there, but rather more scanty than usual. Goldsmiths, carpenters, and potters work in the village. The population is composed of 1,352 Hindus and only of 17 Moslems. Total 1,369.\n\nThere are 352 mud-built houses and two temples, both dedicated to Debi.\n\nThe amount of sales at the bazar annually is about Rs. 2,000.\n\nROKHA J\u00c1IS.\u2014See J\u00e1is Rokha.\n\nRON\u00c1HI\u2014Pargana MANGALSI\u2014Tahsil FYZABAD\u2014District FYZABAD.\u2014This place was founded by the Bhars close to the bank of the river Gogra, here a broad and deep river. The road and railway from Fyzabad, which is ten miles distant, pass through it. R\u00e1c Gobardhan D\u00e1s, K\u00e1yath, received it from the Bhars on service tenure. The Bais and Bis\u00e9n afterwards acquired it. An ancient government fort is still here. It was a station for troops under the former government.\n\nThe population amounts to 5,193\u2014Hindus being 3,664 and Musalmans 1,529. There are five temples, of which three are Th\u00e1kurdw\u00e1ras, eleven mosques, and three Jain temples. There is a masonry sar\u00e1\u00e9 and a Government school.\n\nRUDAULI Pargana\u2014Tahsil R\u00c1M SANEHI GH\u00c1T\u2014District BARA BANKI.\u2014This pargana is bounded on the north by the Gogra, on the east by the Mangalsi pargana, of the Fyzabad district, on the west by Basorhi and Daryabad, and on the south by Mawai Mah\u00f3l\u00e1ra. It is 17 miles from east to west, and 16 from north to south. Its area is 173 square miles or 111,102 acres, divided into 196 villages. The cultivated land amounts to 73,316 and the uncultivated to 32,786 acres. The irrigated area is 21,252 acres. The soil is for the most part loam. The river Sarju or Gogra flows along the north, separating Gonda from Bara Banki; it takes an easterly course skirting only three villages which are often damaged by its floods and are left uninhabited. In the interior of the pargana there is a river (the Janori) which contains much water during the rains, but is in other seasons almost empty. There are six villages on the border of this river; it is neither useful nor injurious. The average rainfall for the last three years 1281-1283 fa\u0161li (A.D. 1874-76)\u2014amounted to 40 inches. Wells are generally 10 feet deep. Silhor Gh\u00e1t in Fyzabad is 14 miles from Rudauli, and Kaithli Gh\u00e1t on the Gogra is 8 miles; by these routes grain is exported to the Gonda district or Simaria in times of scarcity. The bazars are at Shuj\u00e1ganj, Lokipur, Ch\u00e1ra, B\u00e1ridpur, Aliabad Barai, Jakhauli (Sultanganj and Akbarganj in the town of Rudauli). The population of the pargana is 134,050; the houses number\n27,670. Rudauli Bhilsar, Kaithi, Kheta Sarie are villages possessing more than 2,000 inhabitants. Schools have been established at nine places. The post and registry offices are at Rudauli. The police station is at Bhilsar, and there are police posts at Shah L\u00e1l and Bhalsanda.\n\nThe fair at Rah\u00edmganj, which is held on the 27th Safar (February), and lasts for three days, is held in honour of one Molvi Am\u00edr Ali of Amethi, who led a crescentade against Ajodhya in 1856. He started from Amethi and passed through Daryabad, where the chakladar endeavoured to persuade him to stop. Finding his efforts of no avail, he despatched Captain Boileau of the king's army in pursuit, who overtook him at Rah\u00edmganj. R\u00faja Sher Bah\u00e1dur Singh was at the same time advancing from Kamy\u00e1r to arrest the progress of the Molvi, who was caught between the two forces, defeated, and killed. His head was sent to Lucknow by Captain Boileau. His body was interred here, and since annexation the fair has been held, but it is now declining in popularity.\n\nThe Zohra fair is held in honour of Zohra Bibi, the daughter of Sayyad R\u00e1ni of Rudauli, on the 1st Sunday in Jeth. Zohra is said to have been cured of blindness by Sayyad S\u00e1l\u00e1r, of Bahraich, whom she afterwards married. She was buried at Bahraich, but a brick of her tomb was brought by her votaries, and a tomb erected to her at Rudauli where this fair is held. The head sweeper presents a bed as his offerings to the shrine, and the lower classes go through an imitation of the marriage ceremonies.\n\nOther fairs held in the pargana are those at Kaithi held on P\u00faranm\u00e1shi of P\u00fas for bathing Sangam, at Kalwa or S\u00farajkund held on K\u00e1rtiki P\u00faranm\u00e1shi in honour of the sun, and at Rudauli Kh\u00e1s on 13th, 15th Jam\u00e1di-us-s\u00e1n\u00ed in honour of Abdul Haq or Sh\u00e1h Ahmad, a local saint.\n\nThe Government revenue amounts to Rs. 1,47,908; the villages are held under the following tenures:\n\n| Taluqdari | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | 86 |\n|-----------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|----|\n| Zan\u00edndari Bhayyach\u00e1ra | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | 76 |\n| Patildari | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | 40 |\n\nThe pargana was formed in Akbar's time, and it takes its name from the chief town, whose foundation is ascribed to Rudr Mal Bhar. There was a fort and a tahsildari at Rudauli during the Nawabi. The only event of note was the fight which occurred in 845 A. H. between Muhammad S\u00e1leh, the ancestor of the present taluqdars, and Hasan Raza, &c., of the S\u00e1l\u00e1r Muhalla of Rudauli; the governor of the place at that time was T\u00e1t\u00e1r Khan, who lived at Sarkatia near Rudauli. He was a desciple of Muhammad S\u00e1leh, took part with him, and their combined forces gained the victory. The tombs of those who fell still exist in the S\u00e1l\u00e1r Muhalla.\n\nThe chief landholders are Chaudhri Ihs\u00e1n Ras\u00fal of Am\u00edrpur, Raza Husen of Narauli, Sayyad Husen of Pur\u00e1i, heirs of Mahr\u00e1ja M\u00e1n Singh of Abh\u00e1r, Chaudhri Mahb\u00fab-ur-Rahm\u00e1n, &c.\n\nRUDAULI\u2014Pargana RUDAULI\u2014Tahsil R\u00c1M SANEHI Ghat\u2014District BARA BANKL.\u2014This is a large Musalman town about 37 miles east south-east\nof the civil station lying in latitude 26\u00b045' north, longitude 81\u00b046'20\" east. The principal market places are Akbarganj and Sultanganj. The latter was established in the time of Nasir-ud-din Haidar by Sarfaraz Ahmad, an ancestor of Ghulam Farid, the present taluqdar, and the former by Akbar Ali Khan, the son of Haidar Beg Khan, a Nawab of Lucknow. Daily markets are held and a brisk trade carried on in grain, vegetables, cotton, and cloth. There is a Shrine of Shah Ahmad alias Shekh Abdul Haq, who is alleged to have remained entombed for six months, and a tomb of Zohra Bibi. Fairs are annually held at both these places.

There are 50+ souls to the square mile, and 5-1 to each house. And each head of the agricultural population has on an average 1-5 acres of cultivated against 1-8 acres of assessed land.\n\nWell irrigation is badly wanting, because the tenantry cannot afford to build masonry wells, and the mud ones are comparatively expensive and easily fall in. But the country is cut up by numerous small streams, and if these were utilized as much as they might be, irrigation would be largely increased.\n\nOn the east is the navigable river Chauka which flows into the Gogra at Bahramghat, some twenty miles from the southern extremity of the pargana; on the west, and separating it from Mahmudabad, flows the Sowbe, unnavigable; in the centre are the Kew\u00e1ni and Chauri\u00e1ri streams. The old bed of the Chauka described in the notice of pargana Mahmudabad is also one of the eastern boundaries.\n\nThe pargana is a poor one. There are only two towns in it with a population exceeding 2,000, namely, Sadrpur and B\u00e1nusra. There are no roads\u2014no mines nor quarries. No crops nor manufactures peculiar to the place; no melas or fairs, no remains of antiquity, no great bazars.\n\nThe name is derived from that of the chief town Sadrpur, for the derivation and origin of which name the reader is referred to the town article, and the history (if the traditions of the people deserve such a title) is as follows:\u2014In the beginning the tribe of Bhars possessed the land; K\u00e1yaths drove them out and held the country for 150 years, when certain Sourikya (Solankhi) Chhattirs overran and occupied it for half a century. But the K\u00e1yaths at the end of that time rose against the descendants of the invaders and overcame them, and recovered their ancient dominions in 979 fasli (A.D. 1572). This was 305 years ago: and the K\u00e1yaths dwelt in the land unmolested for 100 years, when again they were attacked. This time the invaders were of many castes.\n\nIn 1058 Muhammad Q\u00e1zi got five villages, and Shekh Ahmad All\u00e1mi 22. In 1065 certain Janw\u00e1r Chhattirs from Bisw\u00e1n possessed themselves of 108 villages, and a clan of Bisens got ten. The K\u00e1yaths succeeded in keeping only 29.\n\nThe pargana was formed by Todar Mal, and consisted of 212 villages. At Survey 52 were put into the neighbouring parganas, and out of the 160 which remained, 114 demarcated villages were constituted. These are held as follows:\u2014Taluqdari 81, zamindari 33.\nFifty-six of the former are held by the Mahmudabad taluqdar, and 11 by Th\u0101kur Gum\u00e1n Singh of the neighbouring Kundri pargana. The proprietary title to the 160 villages is distributed thus\u2014119\u00bd Musalmans; 11 Raikw\u0101rs; 5 Seths; 4 Janw\u0101r Chhattris; 4 Panw\u0101rs, 4 Kashmiri Brahmins. The remainder are held by K\u0101yaths, bankers, and a Gosh\u016b\u00edn.\n\nThe account which makes the K\u0101yaths once powerful over the whole pargana is no doubt incorrect, and no one but the q\u0101n\u016bngos believe it, if even they do. But it has been recorded here as being the only history of the place which I have been able to procure.\n\nIn the \u0100in-i-Akbari the pargana of Sadrpur is included in Sark\u0101r Khairabad.\n\nSADRPUR*\u2014Pargana SADRPUR\u2014Tahsil B\u0100RI\u2014District SITAPUR.\u2014Sadrpur is 30 miles south-east from Sitapur, the route from which place to it is the high road to Bisw\u0101n, 21 miles, whence the traveller must go across country still in the same direction, 9 miles; neither high road, river, canal, nor rail road connect it with any place. The town was founded in the year 974 fa\u1e63l\u012b (1567 A.D.) by one Sadr Jah\u0101n who gave his name to the place; subsequently a K\u0101yath family acquired it.\n\nIt is an insignificant place, with a population of only 2,109, which includes 982 of Kherwal, both towns having been demarcated as one. The mud-built houses are 280 in number, and there are some masonry buildings. At the school the average daily attendance is 57. At the usual bi-weekly bazar the ordinary necessaries of life are sold, the value of the sales for last year being Rs. 4,200.\n\nThe situation of the town is good; the climate favourable; Mahmudabad is 10 miles to the south across country; and the chauka, a navigable river, is four miles to the north-west. No fair is held here.\n\nSADULLAHNAGAR Pargana\u2020\u2014Tahsil UTRAULA\u2014District GONDA.\u2014This pargana is bounded on the north by the Utraula pargana, from which it is divided by the Kuw\u0101na, on the west by Gonda, on the east by B\u016brha-p\u0101ra, and on the south the Bis\u016bhi, running along its whole frontier, separates it from Manikapur. Its total area is 103 square miles, and the greatest length in a straight line from east to west 13; its greatest breadth, which is at its eastern boundary nine miles. Both of the bounding rivers are fordable after the rains by men and cattle at short intervals of one or two miles, and the more important tracks are furnished with faggot bridges for the easier transit of carts. The Utraula and Nawabganj road cuts through its western corner, passing under the police station at Rahra, and taking off the greater part of the local grain traffic. Rough cart tracks, crossing the Bis\u016bhi at the Maddo and Singh\u0101r gh\u0101ts, converge on the same bazar, and tap the eastern half of the pargana. To the north and the south along the banks of both streams is a fringe of forest varying in depth from three miles to a few hundred yards, but containing little good timber. The s\u0101l trees, stunted by excessive crowding, never attain sufficient size to make them of any great value, and except the J\u0101mun, which is plentiful, and attains a fair growth at the very brink of the water,\n\n* By Mr. M. Ferrar, C.S.\n\u2020 By Mr. W. C. Benett, C.S., Assistant Commissioner.\nand is of use both for building and burning, the only tree of any consequence is the mahua, whose flowers and fruit are leased out at considerable sums for the manufacture of spirits and oil, and whose wood is largely employed in roofing the mud huts of the neighbouring villages. Game is not particularly plentiful, though spotted deer and nil-gaie, and even an occasional panther, may be found in the remoter thickets, and the jungle clearings swarm in places with hares and grey partridge. The centre of the pargana is a flat ugly plain, underwooded and covered with fair cultivation alternating with tracts of the long khar grass, the home here and there of an unfrequent black buck. The soil is of a light dry loam, and, as the whole is included in the central table-land of the district, the constant moisture of the southern tarhar and the stiff clay of the Sub-Himalayan tar\u00e1i are equally unknown. Water may be struck almost anywhere at a depth of from fifteen to twenty feet from the surface, and irrigation is very common both from wells and from the small tanks which stud the whole pargana, and form natural storage reservoirs for the rain water. Brick wells cemented with mud are most usual; but in the jungle clearing they are often square holes walled with planks of sal wood dovetailed at the corners. There are practically only two crops, the winter harvest being as elsewhere on the uparh\u00e1r hardly known. The cultivated area is 37,406 acres, or rather more than 56 per cent. of the whole. In this 12,025 acres are under both crops, and 22,040 under kharif, and 24,675 under rabi; the small balance having been fallow at the time of survey. The only important autumn products are rice and kodo, covering respectively 15,545 and 1,890 acres. In the spring wheat takes the lead with 8,060, and is closely followed by gram which grows most luxuriantly on the land lately reclaimed from jungle with 6,670 acres. The remaining crops of any consequence are arhar, peas, and linseed. Cultivation is nowhere, except in a very few villages in the centre of the pargana, of a high class, and the settlement returns give an average area of nine cultivated acres to each plough.\n\nAfter the mutiny the larger tracts of jungle were declared Government property, and sold in six separate parcels aggregating an area of 8,489 acres. The remaining 57,387 acres have been demarcated in 106 villages, and there are 401 hamlets and outlying houses. Floods being unknown, there is no necessity for selecting high spots, and habitations are scattered closely all over the cultivated area. The only bazars are at Rahra and Sadullahnagar, and they are merely small collections of mud huts, where it is often difficult to get even grain for a moderately sized encampment.\n\nOwing to the extent of jungle the population is for Oudh thin, being only 35,152 or 341 to the square mile; of these 6,931 are Muhammadans, and the high proportion of nearly a fifth of the inhabitants is due to the religion of the ruling Musalman house of Utraula. Many are Path\u00e1ns, but the majority are either low-caste weavers, or new converts to the creed of the prophet from among the agricultural Hindus. Kurmis and Mur\u00e1os are the most numerous castes of Hindus with a total of 5,146, and next to them come the Koris with 3,349 and Ah\u00edrs with 3,442 souls; Brahmans number 2,219, and there are 1,048 Chhattirs, mostly Bisens and Bandhalgotis, of the large coparcenary communities of Itua and Khera Dih. The most active classes in subduing to the plough the fever-stricken jungles\nare Bhars and Lunias, who occur in small colonies at the extreme verge of the cultivation.\n\nUntil quite lately the greater part of the pargana was under a dense jungle, the home of predatory bands of Siy\u00e1r Khawwas (jackal eaters), Qalandars, and Banj\u00e1ras, and others of the singular nomadic tribes, whose ethnological position it is so difficult to determine, and most of the present tilth commenced with the purchase of parcels of land in birt from the later R\u00e1jas of Utraula. Some idea of the scantiness of the agricultural population at the commencement of the present century, when the practice of selling birt rights became for the first time common, may be gathered from the fact that in 1815 A.D., the government revenue was only Rs. 6,925. From that time the advance becomes rapid and steady. In 1819 the demand had risen to Rs. 13,312, and ten years later it reached Rs. 24,067. With a few trifling variations, it remained at this amount till R\u00e1ja Darshan Singh in 1838 raised it to Rs. 35,107, a figure which was never again attained under the native government. Shortly before annexation it had fallen to little over Rs. 20,000, and when we took over the district, Sadullahnagar was assessed on the principle of half profits at Rs. 24,048. The progress of population and agriculture since that period has been incredibly rapid, and in 1872 A.D., at revised assessment, the government land revenue was raised to Rs. 56,075, with Rs. 1,522 on account of cesses. In consideration of the largeness of the enhancement, and in view of the fact that much of the recently broken land was held on long leases at progressive rents, the rise has been distributed over a period of ten years, and it is not proposed to take the full demand till 1883 A.D. Anything worth noting in the history of the pargana and its agricultural customs will be found under the article on Utraula, of which it was till annexation a tappa, or revenue subdivision, under the same Path\u00e1n r\u00e1ja. For more than a century the local chiefs have had but little power, and though they sold almost all the villages to birtias, they were hardly ever allowed by the Lucknow government to engage for the revenue, and had lost all direct proprietary rights except the precarious collection of a few unimportant transit dues, and the receipt of nazar\u00e1na, or the feudal tribute of two or three rupees in each year from each of the village heads. In 1849 and 1850, the great revenue speculator P\u00e1nde R\u00e1m Datt R\u00e1m held the pargana in security for money advanced by him to the n\u00e1zim, and succeeded in purchasing a number of the hitherto independent villages, which after the mutiny were included in the sanad granted to his brother R\u00e1ja Krishn Datt R\u00e1m. But for this circumstance only three villages, the property of the R\u00e1ja of Utraula, would have been held in taluqdari tenure. As it is, the proportion of zamindari holdings is larger than it is in most parts of the district, and 62 villages, with a revenue of Rs. 28,356, have been settled with independent proprietors, while the taluqdars have 50 villages with a revenue of Rs. 29,241.\n\nBeyond the mahua and timber of the fast disappearing forests, and an occasional quarry of kankar, there are no natural products of value, and no manufactures except the universal one of coarse cotton cloth for the apparel of the lower classes.\nSADULLAHNAGAR\u2014Pargana SADULLAHNAGAR\u2014Tahsil UTTRAULA\u2014District GONDA.\u2014This village of 706 inhabitants is 28 miles north-east of Gonda, 64 from Bahramghat, and 40 from the hills. The climate is damp, but there is no malady peculiar to the place. Water is sweet, and is met with at 18 feet from the surface. It was founded in 1193 fa\u0161li (A.D. 1786) by R\u00e1ja Sadullah Khan of the Utraula family. It gives its name to the pargana.\n\nSAFDARGANJ\u2014Pargana PARTABGANJ\u2014Tahsil NAWABGANJ\u2014District BARA BANKI.\u2014Ten miles east of the civil station has a th\u00e1na, a barrack, and a masonry bridge over the Kaly\u00e1ni, built by Shuj\u00e1-ud-daula.\n\nAt this place there is a railway station.\n\nSAFIPUR Pargana\u2014Tahsil SAFIPUR District UNAO\u2014This pargana is bounded on the north by the river Sai, which separates it from the pargana (Sand\u00edla) of the Hardoi district, on the east by Asiwan Ras\u00falabad, on the south by Pariar, and on the west by Fatchpur of the Unao district. It is 16 miles long and 16 broad. Its area is 132 square miles or 84,530 acres, divided into 137 townships. The soil is chiefly loam and clay. The staple crop is barley. The pargana is well wooded; some 4,408 acres being under groves. Black buck and nil-g\u00e1e are occasionally met with. Saline earth is to be found in considerable quantity throughout the pargana. Water is found at 30 feet. There are six bazars, and four fairs held during the year; the largest being held at Patti Amaura in September where some 15,000 persons congregate; the fair lasts three days. The other fairs are two at Safipur and one at Siah (in honour of Sayyad S\u00e1l\u00e1r). The Government revenue amounts to Rs. 1,08,368, and falls at Re. 1-4-5 per acre.

The cultivators of the soil are of all castes, and are said to be poor and involved in debt.\n\nThe first mention of the pargana is made in the \u00c1\u00edn-i-Akbari. Before the conquest of the country by the Moslems, the Bhars, K\u00e1yaths, Ah\u00edrs, Lodhs, and Lunias were the proprietors, but they gave way to the Chauh\u00e1ns of Mainpuri, the Gautams, the Raikw\u00e1rs, the Janw\u00e1rs, and the Muhammadans. For the origin of the name see Safipur town.\n\nTradition connects this pargana with the events recorded in the R\u00e1m\u00e1yan, when it relates that the country now known as parganas Pariar, Harha, and Safipur was the scene of the battle of R\u00e1ja R\u00e1m Chandar with his sons Lava and Kus. The lake Mahna is shown as exhibiting proof in its still containing the stone arrows * that were used then by the contesting parties. On the bank of this lake there is a temple in honour of Sri Someswar Mah\u00e1deo, built just after the event abovementioned.\n\nOf the Hindu places of antiquity two only need mention; the temple of R\u00e1m Sw\u00e1mi Mah\u00e1deo, in the village of Vakarma, and of Debi at Balir\u00e1j At\u00e1ha. For the Muhammadan tombs and shrines see Safipur town, where they are principally situated.\n\n* See Pariar.\nThe pargana during the king's reign formed part of the Mi\u00e1nganj Safipur collectorate.\n\nSAFIPUR\u2014Pargana SAFIPUR\u2014Tahsil SAFIPUR\u2014District UNAO.\u2014This town lies in latitude 26\u00b050' north, longitude 80\u00b024' east, and is situated 17 miles north-west of Unao on the country road leading from Unao to Hardoi. There is a daily market in which articles to the value of Rs. 55,000 are sold annually. It is a flourishing well built town, containing 89 masonry houses, 14 mosques and 6 Hindu temples. The population amounts to 7,286, of whom 2,950 are Musalmans. There is a flourishing school here. The town is also the headquarters of the tahsildar of the Safipur tahsil and of an Inspector of Police. D\u00edw\u00e1n Ummaid R\u00e1e, K\u00e1yath, and Molvi Fazl Az\u00edm, who were in high position under the Oudh Government, were natives of this town; the former built a bazar and caravan-sarae, the latter constructed many wells, mosques, and an im\u00e1mb\u00e1ra.\n\nThe town is said to have been originally founded by one S\u00e1i Sukul, a Brahman, and is generally called after him \"S\u00e1\u00edpur.\" A religious mendicant named S\u00e1\u00ed afterwards came to this place, established himself there, and was buried, so in commemoration of his name the name was changed to Safipur, though in the district throughout the epithet of S\u00e1\u00edpur is still more common. The fate of S\u00e1i Sukul is thus related, that in 1389 A.D. Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm of Jaunpur marched with a large army against him, and his master, R\u00e1ja Ugarsen of Ug\u00fa, fought and killed them, ruined the whole Hindu family, and put his lieutenants in possession of the town. These were Molvi Akram, the ancestor of the Darvesh S\u00e1\u00ed, R\u00e1o Mahesh R\u00e1o, paymaster to the force, the ancestor of Bih\u00e1ri L\u00e1l, K\u00e1yath, the present q\u00e1\u0144\u00fango, Sayyad M\u00edf Ris\u00e1ld\u00edr, the ancestor of the present zamindars, Zain-ul-\u00e1b\u00edd\u00edn and others, and Sayyad Hasan Raza, from whom are descended the present taluqdars, Sarfar\u00e1z Haidar, Val\u00e1yat Ahmad, and other zamindars.\n\nOf the remains of antiquity there are several tombs of noted darvesses, viz., Sh\u00e1hs S\u00e1\u00ed, Qudrat-ulla, Fami-ulla, Hafiz-ulla, Abdulla, to the former of which a king of Delhi is said to have paid a visit in 1534 A.D.\n\nSAHET MAHET*\u2014OR THE ANCIENT SR\u00c1VASTI\u2014Pargana BALR\u00c1MPUR\u2014Tahsil UTTRAULA\u2014District GONDA.\u2014A vast collection of ruins on the south bank of the R\u00e1pti, ten miles from Balr\u00e1mpur, and six from Ikauna, was identified a few years ago by General Cunningham as the remains of the ancient city Sr\u00e1vasti, whose site had already been conjecturally fixed by Lassen within a few miles of the place, but to the north of the river.\n\nThe foundation of the city is attributed to Sr\u00e1vasta, an old king of the Solar race, the ninth in descent from Manu, at a time beside which the most ancient myths are comparatively modern. From him was derived the name Sr\u00e1vasti, which appears in the Pr\u00e1krit forms S\u00e1wattha, S\u00e1wanta, and Shr\u00e1vanta, and has since been corrupted into Sahet. Though the words do not at first look alike, it is probable that the names of the river and the town, Sahet Mahet and R\u00e1pti, were once the same, viz., Shar\u00e1vati, and derived from Savitri, the sun god; at the disputed era of the Ram\u00e1yana, Shr\u00e1vasti was the capital of Uttara Kus\u00e1la, the northern province of Rama's empire, which on the division of the kingdom at the death of that hero\n\n* By Mr. W. C. Benetr, C.S. Assistant Commissioner.\nfell to the share of his son Lava. At the commencement of the historical age, in the sixth century before Christ, we find it still one of the six principal kingdoms of Madhyadesa or Central Hindustan. It was then bounded on the south by Saketa, or Ajodhya, and on the east by Vaishali, the modern Behar and Benares; so it probably contained at least the present districts of Bahraich, Gonda, Basti, and Gorakhpur. The king Parasenajit, who is given in the Vishnu Purana as great grandson of Buddha, and who was very probably connected in race with the princely prophet was an early convert to the new faith, and invited its founder to the Kalandaka Vihara in the Venuvana at Sravasti. Here or in Ajodhya Buddha spent the greater number of the rainy seasons during which he used to rest from his missionary labours, nor did he finally leave the place till he started on that journey to Bengal which ended in his attainment of perfection. During his lifetime Suddatta, the prime minister, built the Jetavana, a magnificent monastery whose ruins lie to the south-west of the capital. On the death of Parasenajit his son Virudhaka succeeded, and showed himself a bitter enemy to the faith; he crowned many acts of oppression by including 500 Buddhist virgins in his harem. For this it was predicted that on the seventh day he should be consumed by fire. To falsify the prophecy, he and his court spent the day on boats on the pond to the south of the city, but the waters fled back, the earth yawned, and the guilty monarch disappeared in a supernatural flame.\n\nFrom this time Sravasti remained one of the principal seats of Buddhist learning, and twelve centuries afterwards the Chinese pilgrim collected with reverence the traditions of his faith which lingered round the sacred city.\n\nAt the end of the second century, B.C., Rahulata, the sixteenth of the Buddhist patriarchs, died here after having imparted his secret lore to the king's son Sanghanandi, and at the fourth Buddhist Synod convened by the Scythian Emperor Kanishka, the Jetavana, furnished one of the three principal sects of Sthaviras or Buddhist doctors.\n\nThe greatest political importance ever reached by this state was in the reign of Bikramajit, who, in the middle of the second century A.D., overthrew the mightiest king in India, the Ghavashana of Kashmir, and as ruler of a vast dominion stretching from Peshawar to Malva, and from Malva to Bengal, assumed with some show of right the title of emperor of Jambudipa or the Indian continent. Contrary to the traditions of his capital, he was a bigoted adherent of the Brahmanical religion, and the legends connected with his rebuilding of the sacred places at Ajodhya and Debi Patan show how low the fortunes of that creed had fallen in these parts when he lent it his powerful support. Both were a complete jungle, and he restored the localities of the birth of Rama and of his passage to heaven by measurements from the Ramayana. His identifications probably are the base of the topography of the present day, and it is to be hoped that they have not been a source of error to the pious pilgrim. The remains of this monarch's tank and temple still exist at Debi Patan. His death appears to have been followed by open disputes between the rival faiths, and the story that a distinguished Buddhist Vasubandhu worsted the Brahmans in argument may refer to a more material victory especially as we find that his still more distinguished predecessor Man or Nita had\nbeen worsted in argument by the Brahmans under the Brahman Bikram\u00e1jit. Here as elsewhere royal faiths seem to have been irrefutable.\n\nThe Ajodhya tradition undoubtedly preserves the correct story of the fall of this dynasty. It relates that after a glorious reign of eighty years Bikram\u00e1jit was visited by a Jogi Samudra P\u00e1l, who, after exhibiting several remarkable miracles, induced the monarch to allow his spirit to be temporarily transferred to a corpse. The royal body was no sooner vacant than Samudra P\u00e1l projected his own spirit into it, and refused to evacuate. By this disreputable trick he obtained the throne of Ajodhya and Sr\u00e1vasti, which he and his descendants retained for seventeen generations.\n\nThe fact contained in this singular legend is that Samudra Gupta, who reigned for the first forty years of the third century A.D., overthrew the local dynasty and himself reigned in their stead. The period of eighty years, as the duration of the rule of Bikram\u00e1jit and his descendants, is exceedingly probable, and it is singular, though not much weight can be attached to the coincidence, that from Samudra Gupta to Gayaditya, the last of the Aditya Monarchs of Kanauj, there are exactly seventeen names of the great Vaishya emperors who governed northern India.\n\nThe Chinese pilgrims did not, of course, omit to visit so sacred a city. Fahian in the commencement of the fifth century found it inhabited by 200 poor families, and the grand building in decay; and 150 years later, when Hwen Thsang arrived, the desolation was complete, and only a few monks haunted the ruins.\n\nIt was destined, however, to recover for a while before it finally disappeared from history, and it is here that I must refer to its connection with the origin of a third religion, that of the Jains. The third of their Tirthank\u00e1ras, Shambh\u00fa N\u00e1th, was born at Sawatthi, both his immediate predecessors, and both successors were born at the neighbouring city of Ajodhya. There is still a small Jain temple dedicated by the accounts of the neighbouring villagers to Sobh\u00e1 N\u00e1th. I have no doubt that Sobh\u00e1 N\u00e1th and Shambh\u00fa N\u00e1th, S\u00e1watthi and Sr\u00e1vasti, are the same, and that this was the birth place of the third Tirthank\u00e1ra. The eighth of these supernatural beings was born at Chandripur, and this place is always identified in local tradition with Sahet Mahet, as I shall have occasion to remark when I come to the Mah\u00e1bharata legend. Since the best authorities differ about 1,500 years as to the probable date of these patriarchs, and their very existence is a fair subject for doubt, I shall not venture to conjecture on their connection with the rise of a strong Jain kingdom in the ninth and tenth centuries. Of this dynasty little more is known than of that of Bikram\u00e1jit; one great victory throws them into the full light of history, and an interesting legend accounts for their downfall. Local tradition gives the following list of names:\n\nMayura dhwaja,\nHanesa dhwaja,\nMakara dhwaja,\nSudhanaya dhwaja,\nSubhiral or Suhele Deo or Dal.\n\nThese are diversely reputed to have been either Th\u00e1rus, or of some Rajput house. Considering the almost certain origin of the modern Rajputs, the two accounts may both be true; but, as they were Jains, some confusion\nabout their caste is easily intelligible. What is utterly baffling is that the second and fourth are the heroes of one of the episodes of the Drigvijaya section of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata. The only one who is really historical is the last, whose capital was at Sravasti, and who had a fort at Asokpur or Hatila or Raza, about half way on the road between Gonda and Fyzabad. The tradition connecting him with Dumbria Dih is clearly transferred from the recollections of the subsequent Dom Raj. When Sal\u0101r Masafid crossed the Gogra, he met Suhel Dal* at Hatila, and the Jains were apparently defeated though the place still is reverenced as the scene of the martyrdom of a distinguished Muhammadan officer. The invaders pushed to the north, and if tradition is to be believed, fought another great battle under the walls of Sahet Mahet, which contains the tomb of another martyr. Finally, after a long occupation of the country, the decisive battle was fought at Bahraich, where the Moslem were completely exterminated. In the undecisive conflicts, and prolonged encampment in a hostile country, in all fact but its denouement, the story bears a strong resemblance to that of the Path\u00e1n conquest of Utraula in the time of Sultan Sher Shah S\u016br.\n\nIt is said that only about forty years after this victory the Jain house fell. The king,\u2020 whose name is not given, was passionately devoted to the chase, and returned one evening just as the sun was setting. It would have been a sin to eat after sunset, and the queen, in order to secure the royal supper, sent up to the roof the exceedingly beautiful wife of his younger brother. The experiment succeeded, and the sun stayed to enjoy the sight as long as she stood there. When the feast was over she descended; the sun at once disappeared and the clocks struck nine. The astonished king enquired the cause, and was determined to see with his own eyes the wonder-working beauty. His incestuous passion was punished by the ruin of his state, and amidst a terrific storm the whole city was turned bottom upwards. The modern name Sahet Mahet, says the legend is descriptive of this inversion. This story is valuable as putting beyond, reasonable doubt the first religion to which these kings belonged, the inability to eat after sunset which is the point on which the whole turns being derived from the Jain reluctance to sacrifice insect life.\n\nThe chronology is also not without its value, and I have no doubt points to the conquest of the country by the first of the great R\u0101thor kings, of Kanauj, Sri Chandradeva. In the last half of the eleventh century he made a pilgrimage to Ajodhya, and Kus\u0101la (i.e., Gonda); and with a Chhattri prince pilgrimage is often another word for military expedition\u2014\"na Chhattri ka bhagat na musal ka dhanuk;\" \"you cannot make a saint of a Chhattri or a bow of a rice pestle;\" an inscription of his descendant, the ill-starred Jai Chandra, has been found at Ajodhya.\n\nWith the Ghori conquest of India the history of Sahet Mahet comes absolutely to an end, and it only remains for me to notice one more local legend. Everywhere in the neighbourhood it is told that the real name of the city before its boulevardisation was Chandrik\u0101puri or Chandipur, and that it was here that Hansa Dhwaja reigned, and Arjuna gained his very unheroic victory over the brave and beautiful Sudhania. It is added\n\n* In other places Suhel Deo, the murderer of Musafid.\n\u2020 A similar story is given of a prince in Guw\u0101rich pargans.\nthat from here the demigod marched south to M\u00e1nikpur on the Ganges, where he fought with his unknown son by the daughter of Chitrangada, Bebruv\u00e1hana. The whole story completely baffles me, and I only remark that it has also been localized at Chhattisgarh (vide Central Provinces Gazetteer, page 159).\n\nThere can be little doubt that this city was the Srib\u00e1stam, which has given its name to the principal division of the K\u00e1yaths of upper India.\n\nAll that now remains of this once famous city is the great fortress on the banks of the R\u00e1pti, with a smaller ruin to the south-west, a lofty mound due south on the Balr\u00e1mpur and Bahraich roads, and numerous small piles of bricks, probably the remains of ancient stupas scattered here and there within a distance of two miles of the main city. The fortress is in shape a semi-circular crescent with the concave side facing the river, and is completely surrounded by solid brick walls, the highest remains being to the west, where the ruins of the river bastion are still 50 feet in height. The ordinary walls vary from a greatest elevation of 40 feet on the western front to a lowest of 20 feet along the east and south-east. The interior is covered with a dense jungle, so thick in parts as hardly to admit of the passage of an elephant, which is broken into a wavy surface by the remains of temples and palaces underneath. All the principal buildings were in the western half, and it is there that the undergrowth is the thickest, only ceasing along two or three broad streets which have been left bare, and indicate the chief features of the old city. The main street runs right through the centre, and is built so as to command a view of the great mound Or\u00e1 Jh\u00e1r from one end to the other. To the south it debouches by one of the principal gateways, and at the north it ends in a small square, containing among other lofty remains the two principal mounds, which may be identified with the Sudatt\u00e1s house and the Angulimati a stupa mentioned by Hwen Thsang. The dense brushwood, and the possibility that the city which he saw may have been considerably altered by the later Jain dynasty, renders the application of that traveller's descriptions a difficult and hazardous task, but I am inclined to conjecture that his palace of Parasen\u00e1j\u00edt was situated among the mounds of the south-eastern corner where there is now the small Jain temple. The next principal building mentioned by him, both in his life and in the Siguki, is the hall of the law built by that monarch for Buddha, which would have been situated between the palace and the main street, while Prajapatis Vihara would have formed the whole or part of the long and even line of buildings which face the west of the street. The north-west corner of the ruin contains a large open space with a small pond in its centre, and a nearly straight road running from it to another southern gateway and converging with the main street on the Or\u00e1 Jh\u00e1r. The eastern half has no very important remains, though the surface is broken everywhere with the debris of houses, and it was here probably that the common people had their quarters. The walls are pierced with numerous gateways, the principal being at either end of the main street and the north eastern bastion, and in the middle and southern corner of the west wall. At a distance of half a mile from the south-west gate, and separated from the main town by swamps, which probably mark the course of the old moat, is another\nconsiderable ruin identified by Hwen Thsang with the old Jetavana, once one of the most famous monasteries in India. It is a singular fact that this feature is exactly reproduced in the remains of Rangi in the Rae Bareli district, where a similar oblong ruin lies at the same distance and direction from the main town. The remainder of the Chinese pilgrims measurements seem to have been taken from this point; but it is difficult to select among the numerous mounds the remains of the great Vihara and its rival the idol temple. Nearly a mile to the east of the Jetavana is the high congeries of bricks known, as is the Mani Parbat at Ajodhya, by the name Or\u00e1 Jh\u00e1r or basket shakings, and supposed to be the place where Rama\u2019s labourers emptied out their baskets of earth. This is identified with some probability by General Cunningham as the Purvavarama built by the lady Vais\u00e1kha in honour of Buddha. The top is protected by the tombs of two Muhammadan saints, but General Cunningham cleared one of the sides, and found four pilasters of an exceedingly ancient style of architecture. From the fact that two of the chief thoroughfares of the city so converge as to command a view of this mound, I should conjecture that it was more ancient than the plan of the present remains, and consequently one of the oldest monuments left in the neighbourhood. As yet very little is known of this very interesting ruin which must contain relics which would do much to elucidate some of the darkest and most interesting periods of Indian history. I was once able to spend a few days in excavations, and dug more than 20 feet deep into the crown of the Angulimati stupa, but beyond disclosing a square building of 24 feet each way, with a partition wall down the centre, and a second wall running all round the building at a distance of four feet, I discovered nothing of interest. It is somewhat difficult to get labourers, as the neighbouring villagers have a superstitious dread of interfering with the old city, and will not even enter it after sunset. A storm of thunder and lightning, which came on when I encamped there on a second occasion, was interpreted as a manifest token of the demons\u2019 displeasure with the man who had violated their haunts.\n\nNote.\u2014Since the above was written, the learned S\u00faraj Nas\u00edn Ach\u00e1rya, of Lachhmanpur, in the district of Sultanpur, favoured me with the following information, the sources of which I was unable to ascertain:\n\nAfter the time of Asoka (S\u00edladitya of Kanauj), the Th\u00e1rus descended from the hills and occupied Ajodhya. The dispossessed Buddhists called in R\u00e1ja Sri Chandra, of Sr\u00ednagar, who drove back the Th\u00e1rus, and marching north founded Chandravatipura, now known as Sahet Mahet. His grandson was the celebrated Sahel Dal or Deo who defeated the Muhammadans. Shortly afterwards Chandradeva, Sombansi of Kanauj, took Sahet Mahet, and the S\u00faraj Bansis of Sahel Dal\u2019s family fled to Simla, where their descendants are still in existence.\n\nI am inclined to consider this legend as unusually valuable, illustrating as it does the religious wars which ensued on the fall of the great Aditya dynasty of Kanauj, and confirming the account of the refounding of Sr\u00edvasti after centuries of desolation by a powerful Jain monarch, and the destruction of the Jain kingdom by Chandradeva of Kanauj.\n\nSALIMPUR\u2014Pargana Mohanlalganj\u2014Tahsil Mohanlalganj\u2014District Lucknow.\u2014This is a small town at the 20th milestone from Lucknow on the road to Sultanpur. It is itself of not much consequence, but as the residence of the Shekh Chaudhris of Salimpur, who at one time claimed the whole pargana by right of conquest, it has played a conspicuous part in the history of the pargana.\nThis town was founded by Shekh Salim, son of Shekh Abul Hasan Sunni, the descendant of Shekh Abul Hasan, Ansari, who drove out the Amethia Rajputs from the old pargana town Amethi Dingur. It was founded probably in the time of Akbar, for the family is said to have held a farm\u00e1n appointing Shekh Salim the chaudhri of the pargana. The town is picturesquely situated in some broken and high ground overlooking the Gumti river, and the approach to it lies over a ravine spanned by a long bridge built since the establishment of the present Government, two or three scattered mosques, and the taluqdar's house in the distance, built with some attempt at magnificence, add to the picturesqueness of the scene. But the country is otherwise wild looking and scantily wooded.\n\nThe population is 2,365 and chiefly Hindu and agricultural and labouring. Very little trade is carried on, and the annual sales in the bazars do not amount to more than Rs. 3,700. A small Government vernacular school is maintained at which some 30 pupils attend. The population gives a somewhat illusory idea of the size of the place, for it includes that of some hamlets that have been included within the village boundary.\n\nSALON Pargana\u2014Tahsil SALON\u2014District RAJ BARELI.\u2014This large pargana was formerly in the Partabgarh district, but is now in that of Rae Bareli; it extends from the Ganges to the south, and is bounded on the north by Parshadepur. Its area is 226 square miles, of which 110 are cultivated; its population is 120,545 or 533 to the square mile. Of these 12,252 are Brahmans, 6,137 are Chhattirs, 15,940 are Ahirs, 9,554 Pasis, 12,150 Chamars, 12,118 Kurmis, 10,915 are Musalmans. Of the Chhattirs, 4,099 are Kanhupuras, nearly all of whom eat together and form a powerful and valiant body. The following remarks are taken from the settlement report:\n\n\"In Salon there were 305 villages, of which 20 have been included in the pargana of Manikpur. These form the estates of Pariawan and Lowana. Two villages were transferred from the Rampur pargana to Salon, so that the whole present number is 287. Of these 287 villages twenty-one are newly founded by a grantee under Lord Canning's rules. The grant was made just after the mutiny to Mr. Thomas Palmer of Cawnpore, and is now held by trustees for his wife and children. Deducting these villages 266 are left. They are held as follows:\n\n| Taluqdari | Mufrad |\n|-----------|--------|\n| Kanhupura | 32     |\n| Bais Chaudhri | 0     |\n| Chandal | 0     |\n| Raikwar | 0     |\n| Bisam | 2     |\n| Brahman | 0     |\n| Kayath | 0     |\n| Kurmi | 0     |\n| Murdo | 0     |\n| Shekh | 19    |\n| Sayyad | 0     |\n| Pathan (Qandhari Gharwar) | 0     |\n| Faqir Nanak Shahi | 0     |\n| Government villages | 0     |\n\nTotal | 266 |\nThere are three taluqas in this pargana, viz.:\u2014\n\n1. N\u00farudd\u00ednpur ... ... ... Kanhpuria.\n2. Asifabad ... ... ... Shekh.\n3. Bh\u00e1gipur New\u00e1da ... ... ... Kanhpuria.\n\nThe N\u00farudd\u00ednpur estate comprises twenty-one villages, and the Bh\u00e1gipur New\u00e1da estate eleven only. The name of the former is the old name by which the estate was known by its former proprietors, the Path\u00e1ns, who were conquered and driven out by the Kanhpurias.\n\n\"The Bhars of Salon.\u2014Here as elsewhere tradition goes back to the Bhars as the earliest occupants of the country. In Salon the traces of a masonry fort ascribed to them may be still found. The Bhars of Salon appear to have been no better than their brethren elsewhere: unjust, illiterate, and violent, they were a kind of Phillistines, whom the enlightened rulers at Delhi had to exterminate. Three Musalmans are said to have been commissioned to finish off the Bhars, and having done so they settled at Mustafabad on the banks of the Sai in pargana Ateha, where the remains of a large brick fort in fair preservation attest their residence. Many of the names of the villages are traced to them and their descendants.\n\n\"The Kanhpurias.\u2014These worthies trace their origin to the famous R\u00e1ja M\u00e1nik Chand (Gharw\u00e1r), who once on a time gave a daughter in 'shankalp' to a Brahman who lived on the banks of the Sai. She bore a son named K\u00e1nh, who from infancy was marked for a wonderful destiny. His name is found in K\u00e1nhpur in the N\u00farudd\u00ednpur taluqa. Grown up, he drove out the Path\u00e1ns, and his four sons occupied their estates. These sons were R\u00e1has, S\u00e1has, Ur\u00e1n, and Parsed. From R\u00e1has the Kaithaula family and R\u00e1ja trace their descent, and the other sons have their descendants in various places. The R\u00e1ja of Tiloi in Sultanpur, adjoining this district, finds his ancestor in S\u00e1has, K\u00e1nh's second son. This family acquired great power, and their estates are said to have embraced fourteen parganas, including Salon.\n\n\"The elder son, R\u00e1has, is the ancestor of the N\u00e1in families, and it is said that originally they had fifteen villages only, but they have been a pushing and aggressive family, and being not over scrupulous, they have gone on annexing till they have got fifty-two villages. They have of course separated from one another and hold distinct properties, but this is only as regards the acquired villages. The original fifteen villages are still common property, and each branch has its share in the parent stock of the Pachmad estate.\"\n\nFrom Mr. Carnegy's \"Notes on the Races, Tribes, and Castes of Oudh,\" I extract the following regarding the Kanhpurias, which Mr. Carnegy records as \"the officially accepted version of the history of the origin\" of this clan:\n\n\"This clan is said to have sprung from one Ch\u00fachu P\u00e1nde, a Brahman devotee of Bh\u00e1rat Dwaj in Allahabad. He is said to have been a man of great learning, and was held in high esteem by Hindu chieftains of every\nclass. The great Gharw\u00e1r R\u00e1ja, M\u00e1nik Chand, whose descendants now possess the r\u00e1j of Kantit in Mirzapur, had no sons; he had given the daughters of thousands of indigent Brahmans in marriage, hoping thereby to propitiate the gods and obtain male issue, but all his lavish gifts proved useless. As a last resource he gave his adopted daughter (a girl whom his r\u00e1n\u00ed is said to have picked up at the M\u00e1nikpur gh\u00e1t on the Ganges, and for whom various offers of marriage by other Chhattri chiefs had been made) to the devotee, not in marriage, but as a living offering presented at his shrine. The pandit accepted his votive offering, and in due time, the damsel gave birth to a male child which the Pandit named K\u00e1nh;\" and so on.\n\n\"A very pretty piece of word-painting no doubt,\" remarks Mr. Carnegie, \"and from this K\u00e1nh are said to descend the Kanhpuria clan, with its fifteen r\u00e1jas and chiefs.\"\n\nFrom Mr. W. C. Benett's very able little work on the \"Family History of the chief clans of the Rae Bareli district,\" I extract the following regarding this clan:\n\n\"These trace their descent from the celebrated Rish\u00ed Bh\u00e1rat Dw\u00e1j and their blood is enriched by the piety of eighty-three generations of saints and anchorites. The birth of K\u00e1nh, their first Chhattri ancestor, is involved in much obscurity.\n\n\"The common tradition is shortly as follows:\u2014Suchh, a saint of distinction, lived at M\u00e1nikpur in the reign of the great M\u00e1nik Chand. A fable of Brahmanical invention describes and accounts for his marriage with the daughter of the r\u00e1ja.*\n\n\"From this marriage two sons were born, one of whom turned Brahman and the other Chhattri. The Chhattri was K\u00e1nh, the eponymous hero of his tribe, who married into a Bais family, abandoned M\u00e1nikpur, where he had succeeded as his mother's heir to the throne of M\u00e1nik Chand, to his wife's relations, and founded the village of K\u00e1nhpur on the road from Salon to Partabgarh. The present tribe deity of the Kanhpurias is the Mahesha Rakshasa (buffalo demon), to whom they offer one buffalo at every third Bijai Dasami, and another for every wedding or birth which has occurred in their chief's family since the last sacrifice. I regard this tradition as extremely important. All the leading tribes, of whose immigration their can be no doubt, retain distinct legends of their former homes. Here it is admitted that the founder of the tribe in these parts was also the first of his people who was admitted into the Hindu caste system, as his father, the Rish\u00ed, and his ancestors, the eighty-three preceding anchorites, were of course of no caste at all. The connection with the Bais is more important than that with M\u00e1nik Chand, as the latter is introduced into legends of every date from Mahm\u00fad Ghaznavi down to Husen Shah Sharqi.\n\n\"K\u00e1nh's sons, S\u00e1has and R\u00e1has, completed the conquest of the territory to the north-west of K\u00e1nhpur by inflicting a decisive defeat on the Bhars,\n\n* \"This princess, the only daughter of M\u00e1nik Chand, seems to have contracted several alliances, and to have transmitted the r\u00e1j and the Gharw\u00e1r blood by each.\"\nwhose kings the brothers, Tiloki and Biloki, were left dead on the battlefield. Their names are preserved in the neighbouring villages of Tiloi and Biloi.\"\n\nThe seniority of the Kaithaula family over that of Tiloi.\u2014R\u00e1has was the eldest son of K\u00e1nh, the assertions of the Tiloi family notwithstanding, and his immediate descendants find their representative in R\u00e1ja Maheshwar Bakhsh, taluqdar of Kaithaula. The R\u00e1ja of Tiloi is descended from S\u00e1has, the second son, whose posterity in the race for wealth and power very soon outstripped that of the eldest son, R\u00e1has, and so came to be the dominant family. Whilst the head of the houses of Tiloi has always figured prominently in the history of these parts, the family of Kaithaula have remained in comparative obscurity.\n\nMuhammadan settlements.\u2014The Shekh, Sayyad, and Path\u00e1n settlements are all offshoots from M\u00e1nikpur, established at various periods between A.D. 1030 and 1762. They present no particular features of interest apart from the history of the parent colony. Mr. King continues:\n\n\"J\u00e1gir of Bah\u00fa Begam.\u2014The Salon pargana was part of the vast estates held as 'j\u00e1gir' by the Bah\u00fa Begam, wife of Shuj\u00e1-ud-daula, and mother of \u00c1sif-ud-daula. She died on the 23rd Muharram 1223 fasli, (1816 A.D.). Salon was conferred on the queen of the reigning sovereign, Gh\u00e1zi-ud-d\u00edn Haidar. She was P\u00e1dsh\u00e1h Begam, who, espousing the cause of her grandson, Munn\u00e1 J\u00e1n, in his attempt to secure the succession to the throne, after Nas\u00edr-ud-d\u00edn Haidar's death, was defeated by the firmness of the resident, Colonel Low, as is related in Sleeman's tour through Oudh, Vol. II., Chapter IV., and departed to the Fort of Chunar with Munn\u00e1 J\u00e1n, where both were kept prisoners of State. The Begam and her grandson both died there.\n\n\"Religious endowment at Salon.\u2014There is a Muhammadan religious endowment at Salon which rose thus\u2014\n\n\"Shah Pir Muhammad, inhabitant of muhalla Adhan, of the city of Jaunpur, went to study at the feet of the M\u00e1nikpur saint, Pir Kar\u00edm, who made him his chela or spiritual son, and sent him to Salon to the darg\u00e1h and tomb of the martyr (Shah\u00edd), Pir\u00e1n Paront\u00e1, a companion, it is said, of the renowned Sayyad S\u00e1l\u00e1r of Bahraich fame. At Salon the chaudhris allotted him a post under a red tamarind tree, and his name and fame spread. The Emperor \u00c1lamg\u00edr (Aurangzeb) gave him revenue-free lands, and the grants have been not only respected and confirmed by subsequent rulers (such as Sa\u00e1dat Khan, \u00c1sif-ud-daula, and the P\u00e1dshah Begam) but increased. They are confirmed by the British Government and are represented by eleven villages and some chaks or hamlets, of which the annual value may be estimated at Rs. 16,000 at least. It is probably not less than Rs. 18,000. The grants extend into the Kunda Tahsil of the Partabgarh district, where they consist of thirteen villages and hamlets, of which the annual revenue is about Rs. 7,000, so that this endowment is worth about Rs. 25,000 per annum.\n\n\"Former official divisions.\u2014Salon gave its name to a Chakla of which the extent varied at different times. Either the arrangements regarding\nthe mutual inter-dependence of the administrative powers were very undefined, or the actual limits of jurisdictions were vague; but it is most difficult to get any reliable information regarding the various executive officers and jurisdiction under the native government. Everybody in power seems to have been loosely called a n\u00e1zm, and it is not uncommon for a q\u00e1n\u00fango even, who should know better, to speak of the same person as n\u00e1zm and chaklad\u00e1r in the same breath.\"\n\nSalon is a very picturesque and interesting pargana; it lies rather low towards the bank of the Sai; it is covered with the jungle in which the N\u00e1in taluqdars and other free-booters built their forts. Wild cattle are still found here in large numbers; the banks of the river are bluff and covered with brushwood through which ravines and many bosky dells radiate far into the country. Water is near the surface but mud wells do not last. The Government revenue falls at the rate of Re. 1-10-10 on the arable area, and was raised 49 per cent. above the summary settlement.\n\nSALON\u2014Pargana SALON\u2014Tahsil SALON\u2014District RAE BARELI.\u2014R\u00e1ja Sahasra Bhar is said to have founded this village; it is on the road from Partabgarh to Rae Bareli; it is three miles from the Sai, thirty-six from Partabgarh, and twenty from Bareli.\n\nThe Bhars held this town originally; two Sayyads were killed here because they sounded the az\u00e1n when saying their prayers, the consequence was the destruction of the Bhars. This town is much reduced now; seventy years ago it was a flourishing place; the population is as follows:\n\n| Hindus | Musalmans |\n|--------|-----------|\n| 2,184  | 2,971     |\n\nThere are 85 masonry houses and 1,025 with mud walls; there is one temple to Mah\u00e1deo and ten mosques, with other religious buildings. There is a th\u00e1na, a tahsil, and school. There is also a bazar whose annual sales amount to Rs 10,000.\n\nThis town is pleasantly situated, with many groves and palm trees round it, also a large jhil.\n\nSAMARPHA\u2014Pargana DALMAU\u2014Tahsil LALGANJ\u2014District RAE BARELI\u2014This town is situated on the road from Lalganj in pargana Dalmau, and is the residence of a lady taluqdar Thakur\u00e1n Dari\u00e1o Kunwar. It is pleasantly situated among numerous groves. The population is 2,352, mostly Hindus. There is a vernacular school and a temple to Mah\u00e1deo.\n\nSANDANA\u2014Pargana JHALOTAR AJGAIN\u2014Tahsil MOH\u00c1N\u2014District UNAO.\u2014Lies 7 miles south-west of Moh\u00e1n, and 14 miles north of Unao. It was peopled some 400 years ago by one Sadhan Singh Dikhit, son of R\u00e1e R\u00e1m Singh, ancestor of the present holders. The soil is principally loam. It is on level ground; the site of the village is pleasing; climate good and water fresh. About one mile to the north is a jungle of dh\u00e1k wood. Nothing manufactured here, excepting earthenware for the use of the inhabitants.\nThe population is divided as follows:\n\n| Hindu | Muhammadans | Total |\n|-------|-------------|-------|\n| Brahmins | ... | 125 |\n| Chhattis | ... | 191 |\n| R\u0101yaths | ... | 26 |\n| P\u0101sia | ... | 65 |\n| Ahirs | ... | 97 |\n| Others | ... | 421 |\n| **Total** | **925** | **1,121** |\n\nThere are 217 mud-built houses and three temples, two shiw\u0101las, and one temple to Debi.\n\nS\u00c1NDI Pargana*\u2014Tahsil BILGRAM\u2014District HARDOL\u2014The chief subdivision of tahsil Bilgr\u0101m in the Hardoi district. It consists of 141 villages; on the north and west it is bounded by parganas B\u0101wan, Barwan, and Kati\u0101ri; on the south-west and south by the Ganges and by pargana Bilgr\u0101m; on the east by pargana Bangar. The Garra flows right through it from north to south and the R\u0101mganga flows irregularly along or near its western and south-western border. Its extreme length and breadth are 13\u00bd and 17\u00bd miles. Its area is 168 square miles, of which 107 or three-fifths (61\u00b762 per cent.) are cultivated, a fifth (19\u00b791 per cent.) is culturable, and less than a fifth (17\u00b752) barren. The proportion of the cultivated area returned as third class, that is, light and sandy is 15\u00b765 per cent. only a sixth of it (16\u00b737 per cent.) is irrigated, the area watered from tanks and ponds (11\u00b740 per cent.) being more than twice as large as that watered from wells (4\u00b797 per cent.). The number of wells and ponds are returned at 1757 and 1157 respectively. The percentage under groves is unusually low, only 9\u00b75. The average area of cultivation per plough is 6\u00bd acres.\n\nThe pargana is divided into two distinct portions by the irregular sandy ridge, which running down through it from north to south immediately to the east of S\u00e1ndi marks the edge of an ancient channel of, as I believe, the Ganges, long since abandoned in its gradual westward recession. All the villages on and to the east of this ridge are poor, uneven, and sandy. Irrigation is scanty and difficult. In some villages wells cannot be made, at all, in others only the small pot and lever (dhenkli) wells can be made and these have constantly to be renewed. On the other hand, all of the country to the west of this ridge, that is to say, four-fifths or more of the pargana is a distinctly alluvial tract, levelled and enriched by the floods of three Himalayan rivers, the Garra, Ramganga, and Ganges, and by minor streams such as the Sendha. All this tract is tar\u0101i, that is to say, it has been scooped by fluvial action out of the adjacent bangar or original plateau, and in it the water level is always so near the surface that in the dry months percolation largely supplies the want of irrigation, while in the rainy season it is more or less completely flooded. It constitutes in fact the flood basin of the three rivers named above. In heavy floods such as those of 1871, a sea of waters spreads from S\u00e1ndi, 20 miles west to Fatehgarh. The rivers bring down a rich alluvial deposit locally called seo, which greatly fertilizes the submerged fields and makes manure.\n\n* By Mr. A. H. Harlington, C. S., Assistant Commissioner.\nunnecessary. The deposit brought down by the R\u00e1mganga is considered the richest. In heavy floods it is sometimes spread two feet thick over the fields. Besides its richness it has this further advantage, that its preparation for seed involves only a quarter of the labour required for ordinary land.\n\nThe autumn crops in this part of the district cannot be depended on, and if the floods are late in running off, the spring sowings suffer. Along the Garra, which flows between well defined banks of from fifteen to twenty feet high, irrigation is carried on by the pot and lever (dhenkli) or by the lift (beri). Opposite S\u00e1ndi I have seen five lifts at work to fetch the water up to the fields. Wheat and even opium are grown up to the very edge of the bank. Watering from the Sendha is very difficult and expensive owing to the depth of the stream below its banks. Much of the soil in this rivered tract is a hard stiff cold clay requiring large and powerful bullocks to force the plough through it and heavy rains to soften it. A natural consequence of the moisture of the surface and slight need of artificial irrigation is that irrigated and unirrigated lands in many villages fetch much the same rent.\n\nAway from the Garra the country is poorly wooded. There is little jungle except a patch full of nil-g\u00e1e at Jeori on the Sendha. In some villages, especially those along the R\u00e1mganga, a rank deep rooted grass called sarai is very baneful. Every flood brings down fresh seeds of it, and not improbably it will in time be as bad a pest as the \"kans\" of Bundelkand.\n\nIn this low river swept tract the soil of the bangar has here and there withstood the fluvial action, and has left a high isolated bluff overlooking the surrounding champaign. The views from these \"coigns of vantage\" is very striking. Thus from Malanthu Khera the eye can range from the Christian spire of Fatehgarh Church, twelve miles away across the Ganges; on the west, to the pagan pinnacle of B\u00e1wan Shiw\u00e1la, fourteen miles to the east, or from S\u00e1ndi fort on one hand to the groves of Siwaichpur on the other. Another grand view is to be had from S\u00e1ndi fort.\n\nThe S\u00e1ndi lake, called 'D\u00e1har,' has been formed, I suppose, by the silting up of the channel of the great river which must have flowed close up to the sandy ridge on the east of it, much in the same way as the snipe-famed Baghar T\u00e1l near Bahramghat has been formed by the silting of the Sarju. It is two miles long, with a breadth of from four to six furlongs, and abounds in fish and water-fowl.\n\nThe beauty of the groves round S\u00e1ndi attracted Sir W. Sleeman's attention. Writing in 1850, he says* :-\"I observed very fine groves of mango trees close to Sandee planted by merchants and shopkeepers of the place. The oldest are still held by descendants of those by whom they were first planted more than a century ago; and no tax whatever is imposed upon the trees of any kind, or upon the lands on which they stand. Many young groves are growing up around to replace the old ones as they decay; and the greatest possible security is felt in the tenure by which they are held\n\n* Vol. II., pages 31-32, Tour through O dh.\nby the planter, or his descendants, though they hold no written lease or deed of gift, and have neither law nor court of justice to secure it to them. Groves and solitary mango, semul, tamarind, mhowa, and other trees, whose leaves and branches are not required for the food of elephants and camels, are more secure in Oude than in our own territories; and the country is, in consequence, much better provided with them. While they give beauty to the landscape they alleviate the effects of droughts to the poorer classes from the fruit they supply; and droughts are less frequently and less severely felt in a country so intersected by fine streams, flowing from the tarae forest or down from the perpetual snows of neighbouring hills; and keeping the water always near the surface, these trees tend also to render the air healthy by given out oxygen in large quantities during the day and absorbing carbonic acid gas.\"\n\nThe taluqdari tenure obtains in 30\u00bd villages, 61\u00bd are zamindari, and 49 imperfect pattidari.\n\nThe Government demand, excluding cesses is Rs. 1,27,218\u2014a rise of 23-13 per cent. over the summary assessment. It falls at Re. 1-14-7 on the cultivated acre; 1-2-10 per acre of total area; 11-10-7 per plough; Rs. 2-9-4 per head of agricultural and 1-13-2 per head of total population.\n\nThe incidence of population is 415 to the square mile. The leading statistics are\u2014\n\nTotal 69,751; Hindus to Muhammadans 64,252 to 5,499; males to females 37,734 to 32,017, agriculturists to non-agriculturists 49,289 to 20,462. Brahmans (8,756) and Ahirs (8,240) head the list. Then come Kisans and Chamars, Chhatris (5,984) and Murasos (4,853).\n\nThere is an aided school at Sandi and village schools have been established at Palia and Chamarsar. The opium department has a weighing station at Sandi.\n\nThe Ain-i-Akbari contains the following mention of the pargana:\u2014\n\nCultivated area, 2,11,814 bighas.\nRevenue, mal, 31,55,339 dama.\nSiyar ghal ... 1,95,108 \"\nZamindars, Bomans.\nGarrison, 30 sawars and 2,000 foot soldiers.\n\nThe chief products are wheat, barley, bajra, gram, juara, arhar and paddy. At survey wheat covered a third of the cultivated area; barley between a fifth and fourth; bajra and gram together a fourth. The areas under sugarcane, cotton, tobacco, indigo, and poppy were respectively only 353, 18,979, 50, and 1 acres.\n\nThe climate of Sandi itself is considered very good, but the wells are brackish.\nThe 141 villages are held thus:\n\n| Kat\u00ed\u00e1rs | ... | ... | ... | 35 |\n|---------|-----|-----|-----|----|\n| Sombansis | ... | ... | ... | 16 |\n| Janw\u00e1ras | ... | ... | ... | 10 |\n| Bant\u00edlas | ... | ... | ... | 1\u00bd |\n| Nikumbhas | ... | ... | ... | 2 |\n| Chauh\u00e1ns | ... | ... | ... | 1 |\n| Gaura | ... | ... | ... | 5\u00bd |\n| Ralkw\u00e1ras | ... | ... | ... | 4 |\n| Bais | ... | ... | ... | 2 |\n| R\u00e1thors | ... | ... | ... | 1 |\n| Galalw\u00e1ras | ... | ... | ... | 1 |\n| Katerias | ... | ... | ... | 1 |\n| B\u00e1chhils | ... | ... | ... | 1 |\n\nTotal Chhattirs | ... | ... | ... | 80\u00bd\n\n| Sayyads | ... | ... | ... | 18\u00bd |\n| Pathans | ... | ... | ... | 5 |\n| Shekhs | ... | ... | ... | 2 |\n| Mughals | ... | ... | ... | 1 |\n\nTotal Muhammadans | ... | ... | ... | 26\n\n| Brahmans | ... | ... | ... | *11\u00bd |\n| Ahirs | ... | ... | ... | 1\u00bd |\n| Government | ... | ... | ... | 12 |\n| K\u00e1yaths | ... | ... | ... | 4 |\n| Lodhs | ... | ... | ... | 5\u00bd |\n\n* Misrs, Dikhits, Aganhotris, Tiw\u00e1ris, and P\u00e1th\u00e1ks, one each; Dubes four, Pandes two; Chaubes a half.\n\nIt is believed traditionally that \u00c1rakhs preceded Thatheras in holding the country round S\u00e1ndi. The displacement of the Thatheras was effected by Sombansi Chhattirs who had migrated from Jh\u00fasi. At the time of the Muhammadan conquest the domains of the Sombansi are said to have extended over S\u00e1ndi, Kat\u00ed\u00e1ri, Barwan, Saromannagar, Patti, Pachhoha, Shahabad, Bangar, and B\u00e9wan. The headquarters of the clan was at Santan Khera or Santannagar, a fort named after R\u00e1ja Santan Singh, lying at a short distance to the north of the present town of S\u00e1ndi to which it has given its name. The Sombansi were driven out at the Muhammadan invasion and retired to the Kumaun hills.\n\nThis retreat, and their complete subjugation, did not take place till about 1398 A.D. Traditions still linger on the country side of the stubbornness of the defence of Santan Khera, the depth of the moat, the failure of the siege till a channel was cut from the moat to the Garra. The conquerors abandoned Santan Khera, and founded a new town about a mile and a half to the south-east, and named it Fatehpur Isl\u00e1mabad. But pestilence broke out twenty-two years later and caused the abandonment of the new town. The village of Chandiapur stands near the deserted site which is now known as Fatihan Khera. In compliance with the wishes of the inhabitants the old town was re-peopled, and the Muhammadans gave it the name of Ashrafabad. But the new title did not go down. Santan Dih or S\u00e1ndi became its name. The proprietary connection of the Sayyads with the pargana began with Sayyad Husen Tirmuzi, who was a leading man in the conquering post, and was rewarded for his\nservices with several villages in j\u00e1gir. In 1061 Hijri (1650 A.D.) his descendant, Sayyad S\u00e1d-ulla, was killed in an affray with certain Srib\u00e1s\u00e1b K\u00e1yaths of the pargana, arising out of a dispute as to the ownership of the Manjhua.\n\nOn the petition of the slain man's family Shah Jah\u00e1n deputed Bahman Y\u00e1r Khan to chastise the K\u00e1yaths. The task was very thoroughly done, and none of this family of K\u00e1yaths are to be found in S\u00e1ndi. The same emperor bestowed the whole pargana, then consisting of 332 villages, on Khalil-ulla Khan in j\u00e1gir; but later on in 1093 Hijri (A.D. 1681), Aurangzeb conferred the proprietorship of the town and of forty villages which had belonged to the K\u00e1yaths on Sayyad Fateh Muhammad and Sayyad Muhammad, the heirs of the slain Sayyad S\u00e1d-ulla. Sayyad Muhammad was the elder son and heads the bari taraf or senior line, while the junior or chhoti taraf (or saikai) traces its descent from Sayyad Fateh Muhammad. Since then the town, and the post of chaudhri and q\u00e1n\u00fango have been held by this family. I learn from the Bhamapur proprietary rights record that the whole of (pargana) S\u00e1ndi was at one time held by the chaudhrs on a pargana grant from the throne. This ceased in 1194 fa\u0161li (A.D. 1843) or thereabouts. Then every village fell into the direct tenures of the old inhabitants. The pargana had been held by the chaudhrs for nearly 180 years.\n\nThe Oudh treaty of 1772 was ratified at \"Camp Saundee.\" Vide Aitchison's Treaties II., pp. 83-84.\n\nS\u00c1NDI*\u2014Pargana S\u00c1NDI\u2014Taheil BILGR\u00c1M\u2014District HARDOI.\u2014(Latitude 27\u00b017' north, longitude 80\u00b00' east.) An interesting town of 11,123 inhabitants, on the left bank of the Garra on the old route from Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur via Shahabad to Lucknow. For its history the pargana article may be referred to. Tennant, visiting it in 1799, complained of \"the bleak, desolate, and dreary aspect of the country, where you are constantly sinking at every step in loose sand and blinded by showers of dust.\" Heber, in 1824, gives a more cheerful account, but under-rated the size of the place. \"The country,\" he writes, \"through which we passed to-day was extremely pretty, undulating with scattered groves of tall trees and some extensive lakes which still (4th November) showed a good deal of water. The greater part of the space between the wood was in green wheat, but there were round the margin of the lakes some small tracts of brushwood, and beautiful silky jungle-grass, eight or ten feet high, with its long pendant beards glistening with hoar-frost\u2014a sight enough in itself to act as a tonic to a convalescent European. Sandee is a poor little village shaded by some fine trees, with a large jheel in the neighbourhood swarming with water-fowl. It was described to me as a very dangerous place for travellers without my present advantages, and I was told that from thence to the company's frontier the country bore an extremely bad character, and several robberies and murders had taken place lately. The lake was half dry already, and would, they said, in three months time be quite so. As it recedes it leaves a fine bed of grass and aquatic plants on which a large herd of cattle was now eagerly grazing.\"\n\n* By Mr. A.H. Harington, C.S., Assistant Commissioner.\nTwenty-six years later Sir W. Sleeman noted his impressions of S\u00e1ndi (Vol. II., p. 31, Sleeman's Tour in Oudh):\n\n\"The river Garra flows under the town to the north. The place is said to be healthy, but could hardly be so were this lake to the west or east instead of to the south whence the wind seldom blows. This lake must give out more or less of malaria that would be taken over the village for the greater portion of the year by the prevailing easterly and westerly winds. I do not think the place so eligible for a cantonment as Tandeeawun in point either of salubrity, position, or soil. The lake on the south side abounds in fish, and is covered with wild fowl, but the fish we got from it was not good of its kind.\"\n\nThe best market is that held on Sundays and Thursdays in muhalla Nawabganj, but smaller bazars are held on Tuesdays in muhalla Khalisa, on Mondays in muhalla Aul\u00e1dganj, on Fridays in muhalla Munsh\u00edganj, and on Wednesdays in Sal\u00e1mullaganj. The S\u00e1ndi market has a local fame for its small cotton carpets or q\u00e1lins.\n\nThe principal wards or muhallas are called Sayyadw\u00e1ra, Sal\u00e1mullaganj, Munsh\u00edganj, Khalisa, Aul\u00e1dganj, Nawabganj, and \u00danchatl\u00eda. \u00danchatl\u00eda has been built on one of those isolated bluffs where soil harder than usual has withstood the river-floods of ages, and has left a sort of natural fortress commanding the adjacent river basin. Here, layer upon layer, are piled the vestiges of the \u00c1r\u00e1ks, Thatheras, Sombansis, and Sayyads of the past, crowned with the successive remains of an earthwork thrown up during the reign of Shuj\u00e1-ud-daula, a factory built by European enterprise at a rather later date, a chakladar's tahsil and fort, an English tahsil and police station established at annexation, and now a Government opium godown or weighing house and office. A gloomy association clings to this building, for it was here, in 1870, that the opium officer Mr. MacMullen was atrociously murdered by his bearer, who in revenge for a trifling punishment by the kindest and most indulgent of masters, blew out his brains as he lay asleep, and then gave out that his master had committed suicide. A moment's glance at the poor victim's body refuted the lie; the murderer confessed his crime, and was hanged for it.\n\nIn Sayyadw\u00e1ra the chief buildings are a mosque and mansion built by Sayyad Qutb-ud-d\u00edn Husen Khan, chakladar at annexation of B\u00e1ngarmau and S\u00e1ndi. In this house is located the Government aided school, averaging 102 pupils. To the south of it is an im\u00e1mb\u00e1ra and mosque built in 1844. Two other mosques adorn the quarter raised by Munshi Mub\u00e1rek Ali and Naj\u00e1b\u00e1t Ali, reader of the khutba or prayer for the king. Sal\u00e1mullaganj, named after one of the Sayyad chaudhris of the pargana, boasts its rauza built in 1738 by Sayyad Muhammad Amjad, father of chaudhri Sal\u00e1m-ulla, and a mosque built by the same Sayyad three years later.\n\nTo the east of the town are the darg\u00e1hs and graves of Sh\u00e1h Allah Bakhsh Darwesh, called also zinda P\u00edr and of Maul\u00e1na Kh\u00e1l\u00eds, faq\u00edrs of great local renown, and claimed by tradition as companions in arms of Sayyad S\u00e1l\u00e1r Masa\u00fad,\nThese tombs seem to have been constructed about the end of the fourteenth century. One of them has evidently been chiefly built out of the ruins of a Hindu temple, being made almost entirely of large blocks of kankar of different sizes. At the edge and in front of the raised platform are two large blocks, of which the upper surface has been hewn into the segment of a large circle. In their present position these stones are without use or meaning. They have apparently been originally a part of the doorway of a Hindu shrine. Other fragments of pillars and bas-reliefs, belonging probably to the same building, are collected at the shrines of the Mangla and Gobardhani Devis.\n\nIn Munshiganj there is a masonry well of great age, said to be of a date prior to the Sombansi under R\u00e1ja Santan, and called Mitha ku\u00e1n or the well of sweet waters. It was repaired during the reign of Sa\u00e1dat Ali Khan by Muhammad Ali Naqi Khan, uncle of Sayyad Qutb-ud-d\u00edn Husen Khan.\n\nThe Khalisa and Aul\u00e1dganj wards contain many good masonry houses built by wealthy R\u00e1ez\u00e1da K\u00e1yaths such as the L\u00e1las Gop\u00e1l R\u00e1c, Ganga Parsh\u00e1d, and Sh\u00e1di L\u00e1l. Here, too, are two Th\u00e1kurdw\u00e1ras, erected in recent times by Beni Datt Misir and Chhote L\u00e1l P\u00e1nde.\n\nTo the east of M\u00faratganj lies the sacred shrine of the Mangla Debi. Here, in addition to the usual fragments of stone bas-relief, are two small white marble images, of which the feet and hands have been broken off, a huge block of hewn kankar, and a fragment of a red sandstone capital. Close by is the Phil Mati dher, a bas-relief representing a pagoda-like structure, rising over a seated central figure with attendants, of apparently Buddhist type.\n\nIn Nawabganj there is a fine sar\u00e1s. This ganj was built by one Sabadh Gir Gosh\u00e1in, a military officer in the Nawabi. In this quarter used to be cantoned some of the ex-kings' troops, with guns. The road to Bilgr\u00e1m and Hardoi passes through Nawabganj, which is by far the most thriving mart in S\u00e1ndi.\n\nA mile from the town in Admapur at the edge of the lake a little spring wells up and trickles into it. The spot is called \"Brahm\u00e9wart,\" and is regarded with peculiar veneration by the Hindus of the neighbourhood. Here a grove has been planted, and in it over the sacred spring is a little shrine tended by a few priests.\n\nSANDILA Pargana*\u2014Tahsil SANDILA\u2014District HARDOI.\u2014The principal subdivision of tahsil Sandila in the Hardoi district. It consists of 213 villages. On the north it is bounded by pargana Gopamau, on the west by parganas B\u00e1lamau and Mall\u00e1nw\u00e1n, on the south-west and south by parganas B\u00e1ngarmau, Safipur, and Moh\u00e1n Aur\u00e1s of Lucknow, on the east by parganas Gundwa and Kaly\u00e1n Mal, and across the Gumti by pargana Aurangabad of Sitapur. The Sai flows along the greater part of its south-western and southern border.\n\n* By Mr. A. H. Harington, C.S.\nIn shape it is an irregular rhombus, with an extreme length and breadth of 31 and 22 miles. Its area is 329 square miles, of which 170 or 51\u00b714 per cent. are cultivated. Rather more than a fifth (22\u00b756 per cent.) is culturable; a fourth (24\u00b77 per cent.) is returned as barren. More than a fourth (27\u00b765 per cent.) is rated as third class, that is, sandy, light, and uneven. Rather less than a third (31\u00b705 per cent.) of the cultivated area is irrigated in the proportion of about four parts from tanks and ponds to one from wells. The percentage under groves is only 1\u00b76; 7\u00bd acres is the average area of cultivation per plough.\n\nThere is nothing very striking or interesting about its physical features. The statistics already given show that it is poorly wooded, that the area of barren and sandy soil is very large, and that wells are scarce. This last circumstance is owing to the sandiness of the subsoil\u2014a feature always met with in the vicinity of Indian rivers. The worst and sandiest tract is to the north near Beniganj and M\u00e1njh\u00e1g\u00e1on. Here the neighbourhood of the Gumti, which forms the north-eastern border, is plainly visible for miles inland from it, in the great irregularity of the surface, scantiness of wells and jhils, and the lightness of the sandy undulating soil. This region abounds in extensive herds of deer, whose depredations add seriously to the cultivator's difficulties. Southwards, as the scene shifts towards the centre of the pargana, a more even surface and a firmer soil is reached, abounding in jhils of no great size, of which the largest is at Rai-son. It is notable for the number of grebe on it, and the advantages for duck shooting presented by the embankments across it. The Baita n\u00e1la rises among the jhils in the east centre of the pargana and drains its south-eastern side.\n\nLarge tracts of dh\u00e1k jungle and barren waste follow its course, and it is not much used for irrigation. Towards the Sai on the west the soil again deteriorates.\n\nIt becomes sandy and unable to retain water. Jhils disappear. The surface becomes uneven. But the slope into the basin of the Sai is neither steep nor deep, so that there is comparatively little of the scour which so disastrously affects the Gumti side of the district.\n\nFor the same reason the land on this side is less sandy, that is, less denuded of its loamy particles. A few spotted deer (ch\u00edta) still linger in the Utar Gui\u00e1n jungle near Kachhona.\n\nThe main road is the unmetalled one from Lucknow to Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur, passing through Sandila, from Malihabad, and Kachhona, on its way to Hardoi. Parallel to it now runs the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway with stations at Sandila and Kachhona. From Sandila other unmetalled district roads branch off south-westward to B\u00e1ngarmau, westward to Ghaus-ganj and Mall\u00e1nw\u00e1n, and northward to Beniganj and N\u00edmkh\u00e1r.\n\nThe chief products are barley, wheat, b\u00e1jra, gram, arhar, m\u00e1sh, paddy, and jn\u00e1r. Of these at survey barley covered a fourth of the cultivated area; wheat a fifth; b\u00e1jra and gram together rather more than a fifth; rather more than another fifth was cropped with arhar, m\u00e1sh, paddy, and jn\u00e1r. The areas returned as under cotton, cane, poppy, tobacco, and indigo were respectively 2,618, 1,789, 276, 267, and 9 acres.\nThe climate is considered average, but damp makes it unhealthy at and near Sandila.\n\nThe 213 villages are held thus:\n\n| Village       | Number |\n|---------------|--------|\n| Nikumbus      | 50     |\n| Janwars       | 13     |\n| Raikwars      | 2      |\n| Bais          | 1      |\n| Ahbans        | 9      |\n| Kachhwahas    | 5      |\n| Sakarwars     | 2      |\n| Gharwars      | 1      |\n| Chauhans      | 6      |\n| **Total Chhattis** | **88** |\n\n| Community     | Number |\n|---------------|--------|\n| Tiwari Brahmins | 1     |\n| Dube          | 1      |\n| Sukul         | 1      |\n| Bilwar        | 1      |\n| Saraswat      | 1      |\n| **Total Brahmins** | **5** |\n\n| Community     | Number |\n|---------------|--------|\n| Shekhs        | 63     |\n| Sayyads       | 17     |\n| Pathans       | 1      |\n| **Total Muhammadans** | **81** |\n\n| Community     | Number |\n|---------------|--------|\n| Kayaths       | 41     |\n| Kurmis        | 2      |\n| Kalwars       | 1      |\n| Lodhas        | 1      |\n| **Total Miscellaneous** | **45** |\n\nThe taluqdari tenure obtains in 114 of the villages; 70 are zamindari; 26 imperfect pattidari; 3 are bhayyachara.\n\nThe Government demand, excluding cesses, is Rs. 1,92,553, a rise of 42 per cent. on the summary assessment. It falls at Re. 1-12-7 on the cultivated acre, Re. 0-14-7 per acre of total area, Rs. 12-14-6 per plough, Rs. 2-11-1 per head of agricultural, and 1-6-5 per head of total population.\n\nThe incidence of population is 417 to the square mile. The leading statistics are: total 1,37,275; Hindus to Muhammadans 1,17,371 to 19,904; males to females 72,175 to 65,080; agriculturists to non-agriculturists 71,569 to 65,275. Among the Hindus Chamars, Pasis, Brahmins, and Muras predominate. Chamars are more than a sixth of the entire population; Pasis are nearly a tenth. Brahmins rather less than an eleventh; Muras about a fifteenth. Among the rest Chhattis (7,054), Ahirs, Vaishyas, and Arakhs (4,215) (the earliest children of the soil according to tradition) are most numerous. Among the Muhammadans Shekhs are strongest (5,076), then Ghosis and Julahas; Sayyads are only 1,610.\n\nThere is an Anglo-veracular tahsil school at Sandila, and there are village schools at Beniganj, Assa, Ghausganj, Bainkdar, and Behsar.\nThe pargana is mentioned in the Ain-i-Akbari as having a cultivated area of 3,93,700 bighas.\n\nRevenue, m\u00e1l ... ... ... ... 26,35,398 dams.\nS\u0101yarghal ... ... ... ... 1,567 \" .\nZamindars, Chandals.\nGarrison, 20 assw\u0101rs and 1,000 foot soldiers.\n\nIn the early history of this pargana Arakhs occupy the place which is filled elsewhere in the Hardoi district by Thatheras. Two brothers of the tribe, Salhia and Malhia, are said to have founded the one Salhia Purwa now Sand\u012bla, the chief town of the pargana; the other Malihabad, in the adjacent pargana of that name in the Lucknow district. The Arakhs held the tract till towards the end of the 14th century, Sayyad Makhdum Alaud-din, the fighting apostle of Nasir-ud-din, the \"lamp of Delhi,\" undertook to drive out the infidels, and to carry the faith and arms of Isl\u0101m a stage farther to the south. The promise of a royal revenue-free grant made the prospect of success as tempting to the soldier as was the expulsion of the infidel to the saint. How long or how fiercely the Arakhs resisted we know not. Only the issue of the contest has been remembered. To this day the Arakhs of Utraula, on the Rapti, 120 miles away to the east in Gonda, recall their lost domains in Sand\u012bla. A century and a half earlier in the reign of Shams-ud-din Altamsh, the Sayyad had driven out the Hindu lords of Bilgram and settled themselves there.\n\nSand\u012bla was their next acquisition of importance in this part of the country. The process of consolidation is thus described in the T\u0101r\u012bkh-i-Mubarak Sh\u0101hi (Elliot's History IV., p. 13). \"The frontiers of the empire were secured (1375 A.D.) by placing them under the charge of great and trusty amirs. Thus on the side of Hindustan, on the Bengal frontier, the fief (ekta) of Karra and Mahoba, and the Shikk of Dalmau, were placed under the charge of Malikas Shark (prince of the east) Mardan Daulat, who received the title of Nasir-ul-Mulk. The fief of Oudh and Sand\u012bla and the Shikk of Kol were placed under Malik Hisam-ul-Mulk and Hisam-ud-din Naw\u0101. The fief of Jaunpur and Zafarabad was given to Malik Bahroz Sultani. The fief of Bih\u0101r to Malik Bir Afgh\u0101n. These nobles showed no laxity in putting down the plots of the infidels, and in making their territories secure\"........(1394 A.D.). \"Through the turbulence of the base infidels the affairs of the fiefs of Hindustan had fallen into confusion, so Khwaja-i-Jah\u0101n received the title of Malik-ul-Shark (king of the east), and the administration of all Hindustan, from Kanauj to Bih\u0101r, was placed in his charge. In the month of Rajab, 796 Hijri (1394 A.D.), he proceeded to Hindustan with twenty elephants; and after chastising the rebels of Etawah, Kol, Kah\u0101ra-Kamil, and the environs of Kanauj, he went to Jaunpur. By degrees he got the fiefs of Kanauj, Karra, Oudh, Shadidah (Sand\u012bla), Dalmau, Bahraich, Bih\u0101r, and Tirhut into his own possession. He put down many of the infidels, and restored the forts which they had destroyed. God Almighty blessed the arms of Isl\u0101m with power and victory. The Rai of J\u0101jnagar and the king of Lakhnauti now began to send to Khwaja-i-Jah\u0101n the elephants which they used to send (as tribute) to Delhi.\"\n\n(1899 A.D.) \"The fiefs of Kanauj, Oudh, Karra, Dalmau, Sand\u012bla, Bahraich, Bih\u0101r, and Jaunpur were held by Khwaja-i-Jah\u0101n. In the same\nyear (1399) Khw\u0101ja-i-Jah\u0101n died at Jaunpur, and his adopted son, Malik Mub\u0101rak, became king in his stead, assuming the title of Mub\u0101rak Shah, and taking possession of all the fiefs.\"\n\nThe inventive piety of the Muhammadans dispenses with the traditional clue to the derivation of the name, and asserts that it is traceable to an exclamation of Sayyad Makhdum Al\u00e1-ud-din who when on his way thither from Delhi cast into the Jumna the grant or charter received by him from his imperial master saying, Sanad Allah, God be my charter.\n\nAccordingly he named his first conquest Sanad-illa or Sand\u012bla, though till then it had been known as Sital Purwa. Taking as his own share a rent-free grant of 360 bighas he built and settled upon it, and it is called to this day Makhd\u016bmpura in remembrance of him; and his dargh\u0101 stands upon it. The tyranny and exactions of Muhammad Shah Tughlaq at Delhi are said to have contributed to the development of Sand\u012bla whither fled many a refugee, chiefly of the Brahman and Chhatt\u012bri castes. In the time of Sher Shah the settlement had become so crowded that Sayyad Husen founded a new town adjacent to it and styled it Ashraf\u012bola. Up to this time no Government officer had been posted at Sand\u012bla; so that, like the cave of Adullam, it was a convenient refuge for all who wished to keep out of the way of the imperial writs; but about the time of Akbar the q\u0101z\u012b was transferred hither from Mahona, and the other pargana officials came in time to be posted here. Firoz Shah twice visited Sand\u012bla in 754 Hijri (A.D. 1353) on his march to Lucknow, and in 776 Hijri (A.D. 1374) on the way to Bahraich. A mosque bearing the date 769 Hijri (A.D. 1367) was built by his order.\n\nThe restoration of Humay\u016bn brought trouble upon Sayyad Husen, who had been faithful to the fortunes of Sher Shah. The town was plundered by Humay\u016bn's troops; Sayyad Husen was dispossessed of his grant, and a force was quartered here. The lands which for three centuries had been held by Sayyads were made over to Chandels. But the tenure of the Chandels did not last long. The Sayyads regained court favour and a portion of their lost possessions. Molvi Muhammad Moia ingratiated himself with Alamg\u012br, who conferred upon him in j\u0101g\u012br for military service Ter\u0101himpur, Tiloi, and ten other villages, and, when he died in Beh\u0101r, sent his corpse to Sand\u012bla to be buried with his forefathers. Most of the Sayyad's grants were resumed and charged with revenue after Shuj\u0101-ud-daula's defeat at Buxar, and the remainder were resumed by Sa'adat Ali Khan.\n\nIn our own time nineteen villages were conferred on Molvi Fazl Ras\u016bl of Jal\u0101lpur of this family for distinguished services during the mutiny.\n\nTwo severe actions were fought at Sand\u012bla on 6th and 7th October, 1858.\n\n**Sand\u012bla**\u2014Pargana Sand\u012bla\u2014Tahsil Sand\u012bla\u2014District Hardol\u2014(Latitude 27\u00b04' north, longitude 80\u00b034' east). Sand\u012bla ranks sixth in\n\n* By Mr. A. H. Harington, C.S., Assistant Commissioner.\npopulation among the towns of Oudh, and second among those of the Hardoi district. It lies nearly midway between Lucknow and Hardoi, at a distance of 32 miles north-west from Lucknow and 34 miles south-east from Hardoi. It is 31 miles east from Bilgram. There is a station of the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway at it.\n\nFor an account of its foundation and political history the pargana article should be referred to. Its four muhallas are named Ashraftola, Mahetwana, Mandai, and Malkana.\n\nThe population is 15,786, of whom 7,629 are Hindus and 8,157 are Muhammadans. They are lodged in 1,114 brick and 3,986 mud-built houses.\n\nBeing the headquarters of a revenue subdivision, the town has the usual Government offices, tahsil, police station, dispensary, and Anglo-vernacular school.\n\nMarkets are held on Tuesdays and Saturdays. Pan and ghi are sold for export in considerable quantities.\n\nThere are no buildings of special interest or antiquity. The Bera Kambha, a hall of the twelve pillars, was built of stone a century and half ago by an ancestor of Farzand Ali and Musharraf Ali.\n\nSir W. Sleeman's notes on the place are worth quoting, written as they were six years before annexation (Volume II., p. 2, Volume I., pp. 336-337):\n\n\"Halted at Sundeela. To the north of the town there is a large uncultivated plain of osur lands that would answer for cantonments, but the water lies, for some time after rain, in many places. The drainage is defective, but might be made good towards a rivulet to the north and west. There is another open plain to the west of the town, between the suburbs and the small village of Ausoo Serae, where the trigonometrical survey has one of its towers. It is about a mile from east to west, and more from north to south, and well adapted for the location of troops and civil establishments. The climate is said to be very good. The town is large and still populous, but the best families seem to be going to decay or leaving the place. Many educated persons from Sundeela in our civil establishments used to leave their families here; but life and property have become so very insecure that they now always take them with them to the districts in which they are employed, or send them to others. I observed many good houses of burnt brick and cement, but they are going fast to decay, and are all surrounded by numerous mud houses without coverings, or with coverings of the same material, which are hidden from view by low parapets. These houses have a wretched appearance.\n\n\"Several of the villages of Sundeela are held by Syud zumeendars, who are peaceable and industrious subjects, and were generally better protected than others under the influence of Chowdhree Sheik Husainut Allie, of Sundeela, an agricultural capitalist and landholder, whom no local authority could offend with impunity. His proper trade was to aid landholders of high and low degree, by becoming surety for their punctual payment of\nthe Government demand, and advancing the instalments of that demand himself when they had not the means, and thereby saving them from the visits of the local authorities and their rapacious and disorderly troops: but in an evil hour he ventured to extend his protection a little further, and, to save them from the oppressions of an unscrupulous contractor, he undertook to manage the district himself, and make good all the Government demand upon it. He was unable to pay all that he had bound himself to pay. His brother was first seized by the troops and taken to Lucknow. He languished under the discipline to which he was there subjected, and when on the point of death from what his friends call a broken heart, and the Government authorities cholera morbus, he was released. He died immediately after his return home, and Hushmut Allee was then seized and taken to Lucknow, where he is now confined.\n\n\"The people here lament his absence as a great misfortune to the district, as he was the only one among them who ever had authority and influence, united with a fellow-feeling for the people, and a disposition to promote their welfare and happiness.\"\n\n**SANDWA CHANDIKA\u2014Pargana PARTABGARH\u2014Tahsil PARTABGARH\u2014District PARTABGARH.**\u2014This town was founded by the Bhars; it gets its second name from the temple of Chandika; it is near the road from Partabgarh to Amethi, eleven miles from the former. The tradition is that Chandika Debi here killed certain R\u00e1kshases or demons. The population consists of 1,960 Hindus and 27 Musalmans. There is a temple of Debi, and great fairs are held in her honour\u2014one in March, the other in October. Each Tuesday about 1,000 people assemble; at the annual fairs about 5,000.\n\n**SANGR\u00c1MPUR\u2014Pargana R\u00c1MPUR\u2014Tahsil KUNDA\u2014District PARTABGARH.**\u2014This village was founded by Sangr\u00e1m Singh, the ancestor of the taluqdar of R\u00e1mpur, about 150 years ago.\n\nIt is on the unmetalled road to Manikpur 30 miles from Partabgarh.

The Dasahra is celebrated here by a festive meeting at which 6,000 people assemble.\n\n**SANGR\u00c1MPUR\u2014Pargana DAUNDIA KH\u00c9RA\u2014Tahsil PURWA\u2014District UNAO.**\u2014This village was founded 1,900 years ago by R\u00e1ja Abhai Chand Bais, who called it Sangr\u00e1mpur (city of the fight): because he had to fight a fierce battle here on entering this country. The place is also called Daundia Kh\u00e9ra, the original Bhar name. Babu R\u00e1m Bakhsh Singh, a descendant of Abhai Chand's, lived here, and was hanged after the mutiny for abetment of murder. There is a vernacular school attended by about 35 pupils, none of whom are Musalmans. Population is 1,190, of whom 106\nare Musalmans. There is one mosque, four temples in honour of Debi, and one to Mah\u00e1deo.\n\n**SARA Pargana*\u2014Tahsil HARDOI\u2014District HARDOI.\u2014** A subdivision of tahsil Hardoi consisting of 85 villages. Pargana Alamnagar bounds it on the north, pargana Shahabad on the west, parganas B\u00e1wan and Gopamau on the south and south-east, pargana Mansurnagar on the east. The Sai, here called Bhainsta, flows along part of its eastern border. It is eleven and a half miles and thirteen miles in extreme length and breadth, and its area is 90 square miles.\n\nRather more than half (52\u00b792 per cent.) is cultivated; a third (34\u00b709) is culturable. About an eighth (11\u00b756) is returned as barren. Not quite a seventh (14\u00b782 per cent.) is rated as third class, that is, sandy. Half of the cultivated area (49\u00b741) is watered from wells (34\u00b719) and tanks (15\u00b722). The percentage under groves is 1\u00b743. Seven acres is the average area of cultivation per plough.\n\nThere is little to notice in its physical features except the excellence of the soil and the great quantities of jhils and marshes. Some of them are embanked, but the facilities offered for rice cultivation are not taken advantage of. \"There are,\" notes Mr. McMinn, \"thousands of bighas of splendid rice ground which lie utterly unproductive. I have no doubt the lambardars object, because the pasdhi (wild rice), which is their manorial right, and which grows spontaneously, would be superseded. They say they do not sow rice, but in some places K\u00e1chhis have raised very fine crops. The country is rather bare of groves. Single pipal and banyan and p\u00e1kar trees are common, but no groves have been planted for years. All in existence are clearly old and mostly barren.\"\n\nThe number of forest trees still standing in the fields is an indication that the pressure of population has not yet become overpowering. The banks of the Bhainsta near Harfaon, fringed with low jungles and shaded by stately beech-like \"arjan\" trees, presents a scene of quiet beauty. A fine prospect may be enjoyed from the ruined fort of Sa\u00e1datnagar, on the top of Soh\u00e1wan Khera. The closeness of the water to the surface\u2014it has rarely to be dug for more than fifteen feet\u2014makes irrigation easy. The sub-soil is so firm that in most of the villages wells worked with the leathern bucket (pur) and oxen can be dug. They cost from two to four or five rupees, and last generally for four years, and some times up to 10 and 12 years. The pargana is pretty well off for roads.\n\nThe Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway runs through its western side, and one of the stations is at Ch\u00e1ndpur. The north is traversed by the unmetalled road from Pih\u00e1ni to Shahabad; the Hardoi and Shahabad road skirts the west, while the east side is crossed by the road from Hardoi to Pih\u00e1ni. But cross-roads are wanted to connect the heart of the pargana with the Pih\u00e1ni and Shahabad road on the north. There are no markets of any importance.\n\n* By Mr. A. H. Harington, C.S.\nThe main products are wheat and barley which occupied at survey nearly half the cultivated area, more than a fifth was cropped with bajra and juar, the rest was chiefly covered with cotton, sugarcane, gram, arhar, paddy, mash, and moth. The areas returned as under cotton, cane, tobacco, poppy, and indigo were respectively 1,785, 1,586, 2,518, and 8 acres.\n\nThe climate is not exceptionally bad, but with so many marshes the pargana cannot be salubrious. Kankar is found in Kursoli, Basoha, Bari, and Kutla Sarae.\n\nThe eighty-five villages are thus distributed:\n\n| Gaurs | Janwars | Sombansis | Rathors | Brahmins | Muhammadans | Kayaths | Ahirs | Government |\n|-------|---------|-----------|---------|----------|-------------|---------|-------|------------|\n|       |         |           |         |          |             |         |       |            |\n|       |         |           |         |          |             |         |       |            |\n|       |         |           |         |          |             |         |       |            |\n|       |         |           |         |          |             |         |       |            |\n\nOnly one of these villages is taluqdari; 40 are zamindari; 43 imperfect pattidari; one is bhayyachara.\n\nThe Government demand excluding cesses is Rs. 60,132, a rise of 31-30 per cent. over the summary assessment. It falls at Re. 1-15-5 on the cultivated acre, Re. 1-0-8 per acre of total area, Rs. 1-4-1-2 per plough, Rs. 2-6-0 per head of agricultural, and Re. 1-11-6 per head of total population.\n\nPopulation is 389 to the square mile, or a total of 34,972; Hindus to Muhammadans are 33,375 to 1,597; males to females 19,052 to 15,920; agriculturists to non-agriculturists 25,069 to 9,903; Chamars are a sixth of the whole; Pasis a seventh; Brahmins an eighth; Chhattris only an eleventh; Ahirs, Vaishyas, and Garerias predominate among the remainder.\n\nThere are village schools at Hariyon, Baholia, Ant, Amrauli, Dhanwar, Todarpur, and Sadatnagar.\n\nThere are no religious fairs; the pargana is thus mentioned in the Ain-i-Akbari.\n\nPargana Sara, Dastur Pali, Sarkar Khairabad; zamindars Chauhans.\n\n| Area | Garrison | Revenue, mai | Siwai |\n|------|----------|--------------|-------|\n|      | 68,832 bighas | 800 Infantry; 60 Sawars | 20,91,983 dama, 8,666 dama |\n\nI am indebted to Mr. McMinn for the following historical notes:\n\n\"The pargana was formerly occupied by Thatheras, who may or may not be identical with the Bhars of Sultanpur, who afterwards spread to the Chambal and the Ganges. Then Chamar Gaurs came in from about ten miles north of Bijnaur in Jai Chand's time. They came in under two chiefs, bringing with them Dichhit Brahmins, who up to date are their...\"\nrecognized priests. They first settled at Basowa in this pargana about six miles south-east of Pih\u00e1ni, on the border of a large jh\u00edl. From thence they scattered to all quarters, colonizing and conquering. They established, according to their own account, 370 villages in the parganas principally of Sara, B\u00e1wan, Bangar, and Gopamau. They differ entirely from the Chamar Gaurs who came from near Cawnpore, whose hereditary priests are Tiw\u00e1ri Brahmins. The Th\u00e1kurs having established military stations rather than colonies, I do not think that they ever condescended to touch a plough. They have held their villages with a tight hand ever since. Up to the establishment of the Oudh Government they were de facto and de jure lords of the soil. They were subject to the Mitauli raja, an Abhan Th\u00e1kur, but he does not seem to have interfered with their possession. Shah \u00c1lam of Delhi granted a few villages rent-free to the Q\u00e1zi of B\u00e1ri, which were afterwards resumed by the Oudh Government, but with that exception I can find no traces of disturbance in the holding of the territory till the reign of \u00c1sif-ud-daula. In his reign, Sa\u00e1dat Khan, the ancestor of the Nawab Dost Ali Khan, being tahsildar of the pargana, and a man of great ability, managed through mortgages, purchases, and other well known means, to become master of about forty villages in the north and east of the pargana, and shortly afterwards Jagann\u00e1th, a q\u00e1n\u00fango, violent and unscrupulous, mastered some more. The Th\u00e1kurs took to the jungles, followed by their as\u00e1mis. The new K\u00e1yaths and Musalmans proprietors found their conquest barren, and after having got sanads they gradually abandoned their gains. Sa\u00e1dat Ali Khan, with his well known exactitude, finding the revenue falling, farmed the four parganas to a family of Kashm\u00edri Brahmins, who had entered India with Zam\u00e1n Shah or rather Ahmad Shah Daur\u00e1ni, and entered the service of the king of Oudh. Their farm lasted with brief interruptions from 1210 fasil (A.D. 1803) up to 1264 fasil (A.D. 1857). The taluqdars were driven out, many villages were settled kh\u00e1m, or the collections made through resident K\u00e1chhis. The exactions grew heavier and heavier, and the Th\u00e1kurs abandoned village after village. There was no room for village lambardars, and no margin of profit for taluqdars. The settlements were always largely in excess of those now holding. In every village there are desolate quarters of bare rain-washed walls, which represent the old cots of the peasantry that fled from Kid\u00e1rn\u00e1th and his Kashm\u00edri brethren. The Th\u00e1kurs are, I should think, declining in numbers. They have very few children; many not married, and plead poverty. They were much oppressed in the times of Kid\u00e1rn\u00e1th, whom, however, they always mention with respect. His mode of adjusting balances was peculiar. Being a Brahman, though of low caste, and a smoker of the huqqa, he used to visit villages which had not paid up, and place himself at the lambardar's door in dharna, vowing neither to eat nor drink till the rupees were forthcoming. The th\u00e1kurs never ventured to be contumacious, and hurried their buffaloes to the nearest bazar. He sometimes devolved the execution of this religious terrorism upon Brahman chapr\u00e1sis. He was a man of conscience, however, and refused bribes and presents.\"\n\nI have little to add to these interesting notes. The only derivation that the q\u00e1n\u00fangos can offer for the name is, that of old the pargana was a\nwild bandit-haunted tract, and that when by degrees it was cleared and settled, it acquired the epithet of S\u00e1r\u00e1 (clear). The traditional account of the expulsion of the Thatheras from parganas Sara and B\u00e1wan by Kuber S\u00e1h, and of the origin of the K\u00e1na and Onai branches of the Chamar Gaurs will be found under heading B\u00e1wan (pargana). The Onai or R\u00e1e branch became the more powerful of the two and obtained the chaudhriship of the pargana. Their chief seats were at Todarpur and Sara. The leading men of this stock are Nay\u00e1z Singh of Pipri and Mohan Singh of Todarpur, while the head of the K\u00e1na branch is Padam Singh of Simmaur and Chandeli. The Gaurs had things pretty much their own way till the reign of Sa\u00e1dat Ali Khan when the N\u00e1sim of Khairabad, R\u00e9ja S\u00edtal Parsh\u00e1d Tirbedi, of evil memory, was set over them. Among the cruelties practised by him was the hacking off of men's noses and women's breasts. The q\u00e1n\u00fango, Jagann\u00e1th Parsh\u00e1d, assured me that he had seen one Manbh\u00e1wan Sombansi of Beg\u00e1on, an aged man of ninety who died in 1867, whose nose had been cut off by S\u00edtal Parsh\u00e1d's orders. The pargana officials used to be thus posted: the q\u00e1zi at B\u00e1ri, the q\u00e1n\u00fango at Umrauli, the tahsildar or \u00e1mil at Sa\u00e1datnagar, the chaudhri at Todarpur.\n\nThe successive steps by which the taluqa of Mustafabad was broken up are thus described by Mr. Bradford in his Ai\u00e1ri judgment. \"The mushroom taluqa of Sa\u00e1datnagar or Mustafabad in 1235 f\u00e1sl\u00ed (A.D. 1828), after dwindling down from 39 to 23 villages, was suddenly and completely broken up. In 1163 f\u00e1sl\u00ed it had consisted of 34 villages; in 1192 f\u00e1sl\u00ed of 37; from 1202 f\u00e1sl\u00ed to 1211 f\u00e1sl\u00ed of 39, and called the Mustafabad taluqa.\"\n\nThe antiquarian will not find much to interest him in this pargana. I give the names of the twelve villages which contain dh\u00eds or deserted sites of Thathera and more recent settlements. They are R\u00fahi, Hari\u00e1on, Kurseli, B\u00edg\u00e1on, Uttar, Ai\u00e1ri, Barg\u00e1on, Todarpur, Dhanw\u00e1r, R\u00e1mpur, Sa\u00e1datnagar and Kam\u00e1lpur.\n\nSAR\u00c1YAN River.\u2014A small river which rises in the Kheri district, having its source in the village of Ahmadnagar, pargana Haidarabad, in latitude 27\u00b046' north, longitude 80\u00b032' east. In a south-easterly direction it flows through that district, and enters into Sitapur at about 49 miles from its source; it receives on its left side the Jamw\u00e1ri, in latitude 27\u00b032' north, longitude 80\u00b047' east. Thence it flows for about 3 miles in a north-westerly direction, and then resuming its previous north-easterly course it joins the Gumti in latitude 27\u00b09' north, longitude 80\u00b055' east. Its total length may be estimated at about 95 miles. It flows past Sitapur, B\u00e1ri, Pirnagar, and other places. It causes extensive and destructive floods in some years, as it drains a very considerable area of country with its numerous affluents.\n\nS\u00c1RDA River.\u2014An account of the river from the point of its junction with the ancient channel of the Chauka comes more properly under the latter name.\n\nIt is described in Thornton's Gazetteer under the incorrect name of Gh\u00e1g\u00e1ra or Gogra, which name properly belongs to the Kauri\u00e1la after it has\nreceived the waters of the S\u00e1rda at Kat\u00e1i Gh\u00e1t. The course of the river, as described in that work, is that taken by it up to about 1010, but not since that date. The S\u00e1rda enters the plain at Barmdeo in latitude 29\u00b06', longitude 80\u00b013', 148 miles from its source, which is 18,000 feet above the sea in the mountains which separate Kumaun from Thibet. Barmdeo is 847 feet above the sea, 798 according to Thornton. This river is there 450 feet broad, the minimum discharge is about 5,600 feet on an average of four years, but in the unusually dry season of 1869 it sank to 3,818 in February. Shortly after leaving Barmdeo it divides into several channels which reunite nine miles further down at Banb\u00e1sa, but again separate, and finally join at Mandia Gh\u00e1t, thirteen miles further south, where the last rapids occur, and the bed ceases to be composed of large boulders and shingle. About half way between Banb\u00e1sa and Mandia Gh\u00e1t at Nagla, on the most westerly branch of the river, it was proposed to erect the weir which was to divert the water into the S\u00e1rda canal. This scheme, for which the preliminary surveys were taken in 1859, and for which the complete plan and measurement were prepared in 1868-1872, was finally disallowed in the latter year.\n\nThe S\u00e1rda after a course of 168 miles becomes at Mandia Gh\u00e1t an ordinary plain river; eleven miles further down it touches the territory of Oudh in the pargana of Khairigarh, and 22 miles from Mandia Gh\u00e1t or 190 from its source it joins the Chauka, near Mothia Gh\u00e1t. At Banb\u00e1sa the river is 500 feet broad, with an average depth of nearly five feet; at Mothia Gh\u00e1t the breadth is about 700 feet, and the deepest channel about 10 feet, but the velocity is not above 2\u00bd miles an hour.\n\nThe following particulars of the discharge are taken from the S\u00e1rda Canal Report by Major Forbes:\n\n\"From the 15th February to 6th March, 1869, when the river was extraordinarily low, and the levels of springs in the Bangar lands four to five feet lower than in ordinary seasons, the loss was 28\u00b77 per cent. between Burm Deo and Bunbassa; the discharge at the former place being 4,747 cubic feet, and at the latter 3,619 cubic feet, or a loss of 1,128 cubic feet per second.\n\n\"From the discharges taken this year, between Bunbassa and Chuknathpore (20 miles below Delaha), it appears that the volume in the river steadily decreases until it arrives about 20 miles below where the shingly bed ceases and the sand commences. At this point there is a slight increment which goes on increasing for about 40 miles, when the discharge is again diminished.\n\n\"For instance, when the discharge at Bunbassa was 6,022 cubic feet per second; at Moondeea Ghat, 13 miles lower down, where the shingly bed ceases, the discharge was 5,448 cubic feet; at Chunpoora Ghat, 9 miles lower, the supply was 5,162 cubic feet; and again, 7 miles lower, at Bylah, it was 5,124 cubic feet, or practically the same.\n\n\"Below this point, however, there was an increase; for, at Mooteea Gh\u00e1t, 6 miles below Bylah, the discharge was 5,502 cubic feet, of which only 40\ncubic feet were due to affluents. At Narowsa Ghat, 8 miles lower, the discharge was 5,651 cubic feet; at Marowcha Gh\u00e1t, 10 miles below Narowsa, the supply was 6,220 cubic feet; and at Bulwari Ghat, 5 miles below Marowcha, it had increased to 6,890 cubic feet; at Sirsee Ghat, 14 miles lower, and close to Delaha, the amount in the river had decreased again to 6,718 cubic feet. Two other discharges were also measured, at 10 and 30 miles below the above gh\u00e1t, viz., at Burragaon and Chuknathpore, giving amounts of 5,581 and 5,592 cubic feet per second respectively; but when these were measured, the supply in the river at Bunbassa was 200 cubic feet per second less than when the above discharges were taken.\n\n\"Deducing this quantity, there still remains a loss of 1,000 cubic feet per second to account for in the distance of 30 miles between Sirsee Ghat and Chuknathpore; but looking at Map No. 3, it will be seen that below Sirsee Ghat the numerous nullahs on either side of the river drain away from it instead of emptying themselves into it, as they do above the ghat; there are also many old and deserted beds of the river in close proximity to and below the level of the present stream, each of which, as well as the above nullahs, are undoubtedly fed by percolation from the river; for although dry at their heads, they quickly become running channels, with a considerable amount of water passing down.\"\n\nThe S\u00e1rd\u00e1 as already stated now enters the Chauka at Mothia Gh\u00e1t, but formerly at some distance above that river it kept a separate course whose ancient channel is still apparent, and which is the boundary between pargana Khairigarh and Naip\u00e1l; in this channel, after a few miles, percolation supplies running water; two more small streams flow in from the forest of Khairigarh, and under Newalkh\u00e1r they become the river Suheli or Sarju. This is a placid stream, in many places very deep, but not more than two feet deep at the ford; it runs under the fort of Newalkh\u00e1r, and thence east into the Kauri\u00e1la at Shit\u00e1bi Gh\u00e1t, keeping the whole time within the ancient broad channel of the S\u00e1rd\u00e1, now covered with weeds, jh\u00e1u jungle, or sh\u00edsham trees. Through this bottom land, a most picturesque wilderness, the Suheli now winds a mere riband of water. The north bank rises, high and steep, crowned with s\u00e1l trees, above the evergreen tops of the sh\u00edsham trees which grow below, and beneath them again stagnate broad morasses, which the narkul covers with acres of feathery plumes. The whole of this ancient channel is the haunt of tigers. Considerable pains were taken to render the Suheli navigable, so that s\u00e1l wood might be floated down it to the d\u00e9p\u00f4t at Bahramgh\u00e1t.\n\nThe nomenclature of this river has been always uncertain. In the treaty with Naip\u00e1l it is styled the K\u00e1l\u00ed\u2020 in March 1816; in May 1816, in the treaty with Oudh, it was called Gogra.\u2021 Both names were incorrect. Tiffenthaler, in 1767, found the S\u00e1rd\u00e1 \"rivi\u00e8re qui n'est pas m\u00e9diocre\" joined the Kauri\u00e1la at Shit\u00e1bi Gh\u00e1t.\u00a7 The broad features of the changes which have occurred are clear enough; there were formerly numerous\n\n* \"Oudh Report on the S\u00e1rd\u00e1 Canal Project,\" pp. 14-15.\n\u2020 Aitchison's Treaties, Volume II, page 206.\n\u2021 Aitchison's Treaties, Volume II, page 164.\n\u00a7 Volume I, page 286.

Volume III, page 278.\nconfluents of the Kauri\u00e1la on the west, the Suheli, the S\u00e1rda, the Dah-aura, the Chauka, the Ul; they joined it at intervals from Shit\u00e1bi Gh\u00e1t down to Fyzabad. The tendency has been to select one main channel, and now the S\u00e1rda and the Chauka uniting into one pour nine-tenths of the drainage into the Kauri\u00e1la at one central spot. The back water of the Chauka and the Ul still form a languid stream uniting at Bahramghat, but the ancient channel of the Ul and Gh\u00e1ghi which joined the Kauri\u00e1la near Fyzabad is quite dry. The same slow process has been at work in the Kauri\u00e1la, the lateral streams have shrunk down to rivulets or have quite dried up, and the central channel has attracted the waters of all. As the name S\u00e1rda is still sometimes applied to the Chauka, and as the waters are still undoubtedly those of the S\u00e1rda, although the bottom and banks may be those of the Chauka, I now proceed to give an account of the latter river.\n\n\"River Chauka\u2014A tributary of the great river Gogra, rises in the district of Bareilly, North-Western Provinces, about latitude 28\u00b059', longitude 80\u00b04'. It takes a south-easterly direction, and passing through the districts of Bareilly and Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur, enters into the Kheri district in latitude 28\u00b021', longitude 80\u00b031'. At the distance of forty miles from the source and in latitude 28\u00b043', longitude 89\u00b015', it, on the left side, is joined by an offset from the river Gogra (S\u00e1rda). It passes on in the same direction dividing the pargana of Palia from that of Bh\u00far, and then continuing the same course, and having traversed throughout the latter pargana forms the boundary of the parganas of Srinagar and Dhaurahra, having the former on its right and the latter on its left side. Lower down, in latitude 27\u00b042', longitude 81\u00b018', it receives on the right side the Ul, and continuing a south-easterly course for about forty miles further, falls into the Gogra on the right side, in latitude 27\u00b09', longitude 81\u00b030'.\"\n\nThe above extract from Thornton's Gazetteer accurately describes the Chauka river as it flowed forty years ago. It was then one of the four rivers which running tolerably parallel in a south-east direction drained Northern Oudh, commencing with the most southerly, their names were the Ul, the Chauka, the S\u00e1rda, the Suheli. Details of the various changes which they underwent come more fitly under the name S\u00e1rda, that is, the proper name of the great river which bursting through the mountains at Barmdeo beyond the boundaries of Oudh occupied sometimes one, sometimes several at a time of these channels, all of which probably it scooped for itself in the deltaic soil, together they take the drainage east of the water shed which is marked by Mina Koth.* The point where the river seems to have diverged into one or other is near the present Mothia Gh\u00e1t, twenty-four miles north-west of Marauncha Gh\u00e1t, a little north of this are two lateral channels; one breaks off to the north and can be still traced, though silted up, as far as the Suheli in whose new course the S\u00e1rda's waters flowed probably till 1810; to the south a channel now almost effaced leads south-east, and after a few miles drainage or percolation again creates a stream called the Ul. Midway between the two is the now Chauka or S\u00e1rda. A comparison of the maps, even of such recent charts as that of the country bordering the grand trunk road published by the Surveyor\n\n* S\u00e1rda Canal Report, para. 3.\nGeneral in 1857, and republished in 1862, will show how variable was the course of these rivers. It must be borne in mind that the Chauka was as is described by Thornton up to 1810, and that since it has been the most frequent channel of the waters of the S\u00e1rda.\n\nThe Chauka proper, indeed, is a mere plain stream; its highest flood discharge is 1,161 feet, its lowest about 50, which now falls into what is called the S\u00e1rda near Mothia Gh\u00e1t near the north-western extremity of pargana Palia, and from that point the joint streams are called the Chauka. It would be more correct to say perhaps that the S\u00e1rda falls into the Chauka, but it is usual to term the smaller stream the tributary, and the larger the main river. Nor will historical accuracy be wholly violated; a river in ordinary parlance consists both of its waters and of the channel in which they run; the former remain the same even if they cut a new channel or resume that of some other stream. Here, therefore, may be indicated one cause of the double or treble nomenclature which renders the chartography of this river system ambiguous, and its historical aspects uncertain. When a great river has changed its course and entered another channel formerly known by a name of its own, the greater part of the world, notably the navigators on its waters, will continue to give the new channel the name of the river whose waters now fill it. On the other hand, the old residents in the neighbourhood of the new channel, who were familiar with the ancient landmarks, see no reason to abandon the familiar name, the banks, the groves, the villages, which they recognise are still there, and the mere increase in the volume of the water seems no sufficient reason for a new name.\n\nThus the S\u00e1rda which flowed past Newalkh\u00e1r and Khairigarh forced a new course south and joined the Chauka at Mothia Gh\u00e1t. The channel of the latter has been in the main the same from immemorial time; it was only amplified by an addition to its waters, yet in course of time it has become the S\u00e1rda, although the people of the adjoining parganas still call it the Chauka, and with greater unanimity as they live on the banks further down from the point of union.\n\nThat the Chauka has not changed its course materially at any rate since 1767, is evident from the valuable itinerary of Tieffenthaler. That traveller in 1767 described a number of villages and towns as upon or near the banks of this river. Aliapur and Mahr\u00e1jnagar in Dhaurahra,* Srinagar in the pargana of that name, Tambaur in Sitapur, Ratanpur near Bahramghat, Bhitauli at the confluence with the Kaur\u00ed\u00e1la, towns still existing are all described as situated at the same distance and direction from the river as they now are. Its channel then is unchanged, but its waters and its names have altered greatly. Briefly then the present Chauka on being joined by the S\u00e1rda, about fifty miles from its source, takes the name of that river with the majority of people. It flows on and eighty-five miles further on it bifurcates. The eastern channel, which retains the name of Chauka, was the only one till 1862; the western one called indiscriminately the Chauka and S\u00e1rda, and carrying five-sixths of the waters, joins the Dah-aura, and occupying its channel after a course of\n\n* Tieffenthaler. Description de l'Inde, Volume I., pp. 285-288.\nthirty miles, flows into the Kauri\u00e1la at Mall\u00e1pur near Kat\u00e1i Ghat. We may follow its further changes for moment\u2014the joint stream becomes the Gogra a few miles beyond Bahramghat; it then flows south-east dividing Bara Banki and Fyzabad on the west, from Gonda and Basti on the east; it is or was formerly called the Dewa and sometimes the Gandak; indeed the changes are perplexing.\n\nThe course then has generally been the same, but there have been several minor changes, or rather what is more likely there were at several places two or more channels, which sometimes together sometimes separately conveyed the water, the river has now gradually settled down into one course, the three principal of these are mentioned in detail, as very important questions connected with property arise when the river alters its channel. The custom of the country is that the deepest point in the deepest channel shall be considered the demarcating line between the contiguous estates on either banks; sometimes for instance in Daryabad in the Har\u00e1ha estate there are tracts of country covering ten or twenty square miles insulated between channels of the river; sometimes the main body of water would take the eastern channel for ten years, then the island will belong to the western bank proprietor, and after ten years perhaps with a change of the current caused by a snag or sunken boat, the vast property would be transferred to the proprietors on the western bank. Since annexation this custom has been invalidated, and masonry pillars which are sometimes buried in the water, sometimes high and dry, form a fixed boundary. The first change in the channel of the Chauka is described as follows in the settlement report, pargana Bh\u00far:\n\n\"But there are many persons still living in the pargana who can remember the last great change. Up to about 35 years ago the river flowed under the high bank from the ruins of the old fort of K\u00e1mp close to Ali-ganj down to the villages of Bh\u00far, Burahia Khera, and Jagd\u00edspur, the headquarters of the great taluqa Bh\u00far. The ruins of the fort of Jagd\u00edspur, destroyed after the rebellion, are now five miles from the river, but the fort was built at a time when it commanded the stream. At the last settlement of pargana Palia, 52 years ago, the whole of the pargana was to the north of the stream, whereas now there are parts of seven villages to the south. At a distance varying from 12 to 20 miles to the north of the high bank or ridge which I have been describing, and to the north of the Chauka there is in pargana Khairigarh another high bank which runs nearly parallel to and at a short distance from the north bank of the river Sarju, in the same manner as the Bh\u00far ridge is parallel to and at a short distance from the south bank of the river Chauka.\"\n\nThe next change which took place was further down the course. The description given is as follows:\n\n\"In the report on pargana Bh\u00far it has been mentioned, that at Buseha in Bh\u00far, which lies to the north of the village of Srinagar in the pargana of that name, there occurred many years ago a great and important change in the river's course. This has now to be described.\n\n* Il faut observer que dans ce canton le Ghagra s' appelle Gandek et qu'on donne Tschoka le nom de Ghagra : ce changement de nom pourrait induire en erreur.\u2014Tieffen-thaler I., p. 295.\n\"Up to about forty years ago the Chauka seems to have flowed from Buseha to Pachperi; and so on in its present channel along the frontier of Srinagar and Dhaurahra. In those days a small back-water of the river left it at Buseha, and passed under Srinagar to the south, and after a winding course of about 12 miles, it was joined by the river Kundwa under the old village of Mahewa, the headquarters of the Mahewa taluqa. Those two villages were large, populous, and prosperous places, both had bazars and temples and mango groves; the former had a large brick fort, built at a time when Srinagar gave its name to a taluqa of Muhammad Bisens of which it was the headquarters, about forty years ago an unusually heavy rainfall caused the Chauka to rise about Buseha beyond its banks. It swept over into the back-water communicating with the Kundwa, rushed up it, and covered the surrounding low country with deep floods over an extent of about 50 square miles. These floods caused widespread ruin; Mahewa and Srinagar and several intervening villages were completely destroyed, and a large tract of country was depopulated, and remained for many years a desolate waste.\n\n\"After the autumn rains had ceased, the main body of water continued to flow down the bed of the back-water, partially deserting the old channel on the north. The Kundwa, which flowed into the back-water at Mahewa, had up to this time given its own name to the united streams from that point, and they had flowed on till they rejoined the Chauka at Rohria, 16 miles east of Mahewa. But from this time the little Kundwa lost its identity by its connexion with its big neighbour, and for the last 16 miles of its course, the united streams became known as the Chauka, and by way of distinction I will now call it the southern Chauka. It is generally called the Chauka in this pargana while the name S\u00e1rda is reserved for the more northerly stream.\n\n\"After this for about thirty years the Chauka flowed in two large streams, its own channel to the north and that of the Kundwa or south Chauka to the south which channels now average about six miles apart. About ten years ago the fickle waters again completely returned into their old bed and left the back-water communicating with the Kundwa quite dry. The great change which occurred, when the waters of the S\u00e1rda-cum-Chauka abandoned their westerly channel and bursting into the Dah-aura with it joined the Kauri\u00e1la at Mall\u00e1pur, has already been referred to. This was in pargana Firozabad.\"\n\nThe next change was in pargana Dhaurahra. At the south-west corner the river up to 1866 ran three miles south of village Aira past the temple of Marwa and the fort of Umarnagar, taking a very circuitous course; but about 1869 it abandoned that channel after having, it is said, cut away a part of the Marwa temple wall and been propitiated by the priests into diverting its waters. It cut a more direct channel for itself about three miles to the north, sweeping away several villages; the river is in fact slowly selecting for itself a permanent channel. The Chauka has a very considerable slope, and its current is consequently rapid. Rising near Mina Koth in Pilibhit, at an elevation of about 630 feet above the sea, at Mothia Gh\u00e1t, where the S\u00e1rda joins its channel and it enters Oudh, the water level is 540 feet above the sea; from this point to Mall\u00e1pur, a distance of about\n110 miles, the level falls at 165 feet or exactly eighteen inches per mile; the length in a straight line is 78 miles, so that the slope of the country is more than two feet per mile.\n\nThe current averages about three miles per hour but there are places when during the rains it exceeds five. It is nowhere fordable after its junction with the S\u00e1rda, before that it is a mere stream. The river channel is considerably beneath the watershed. The high lands of southern Kheri, for instance, run parallel to the river at a distance of about 15 miles. Mail\u00e1n\u00ed is 550 feet above the sea, the river at Srinagar Gh\u00e1t 500, Gola Gokarann\u00e1th is 503 feet, the river at Delaha 467, Lakhimpur 484, the river at Chakn\u00e1thpur 427, L\u00e1harpur 453, the river at Aira 398; it thus appears that the channel is from 36 to 55 feet beneath the level of the high lands. It is thus useless for irrigation, except through a high level canal. The deltaic lands on its banks do not require irrigation except for certain crops.\n\nThe quantity of water discharge varies with the season. It is at its lowest in March. The averages of 1866-67-68-70 were\u2014\n\n| Month | Discharge |\n|-------|-----------|\n| January | 6,300 cubic feet per second |\n| February | 6,471 \" |\n| March | 6,068 \" |\n| April | 6,673 \" |\n| May | 7,935 \" |\n| June | 10,618 \" |\n\nIt may here be noted that the Ganges at Cawnpore only discharges 5,000 feet.\n\nIn 1869 the river being low beyond all precedent, the discharge in February was only 3,818.\n\nThe river itself is not a picturesque one; its banks are sandy, and the variations of its current are so uncertain and frequent that groves are not planted near it, or if they are, are generally soon carried off. At a distance from the channel, where the great river now sweeps along, there are many noble lagunes formed of old by its waters and now deserted; these present grand sweeps of still-water, with high sloping banks, crowned by magnificent groves. The fish are the mahsir and the roh\u00fa; the latter everywhere, the former are met with as far as Pachperi Gh\u00e1t. Large boats, capable of carrying 1,200 maunds, or 45 tons, ascend to Marauncha Gh\u00e1t, and smaller of 500 maunds almost to Mandia Gh\u00e1t. The unpublished maps prepared for the S\u00e1rda canal scheme exhibit the most recent changes of the river channel. That in Tieffenthaler, Vol. III., page 278, gives a fair chart of the river as it was about 1770 A.D. As to the previous aspect, in Akbar's time it did not join the Gogra till close to, about four miles above Fyzabad. There are no contemporary maps to my knowledge.\n\nSARENI Pargana\u2014Tahsil LALGANJ\u2014District RAE BARELI.\u2014This pargana takes its name from the chief town (Sareni), which was founded by S\u00e1rang S\u00e1h of the Bais clan. It is asserted that all these parganas belonged to Bhars, but Abhai Chand of the Bais tribe drove them away, and acquired possession; all these were under one chief, with Daundia Khera the capital. The disunion, however, among the sons of Pirth\u00ed Chand resulted in the separation of the estate, and then Daundia Khera remained.\nin the possession of the descendants of Deo R\u00e1e, one of whom, B\u00e1bu R\u00e1m Bakhsh, was hanged for rebellion in 1858; the il\u00e1qa Sareni fell into the hands of the next brother, Aji Chand, whose descendant, Shiup\u00e1l Singh of Mur\u00e1rmau, is the present chief.\n\nThe pargana was formerly called Bhojpur, and under the arrangements of Akbar Shah was named Khanjar; but Nawab Sa\u00e1dat Ali Khan called it Sareni, and fixed the tahsil and principal headquarters of the pargana in the village of the same name. The village Sareni is principally inhabited by q\u00e1n\u00fangos, and perhaps it was at their request that the seat of the tahsil was transferred from Khanjar to this village. The pargana comprises 169 villages; it is 11 miles in length from east to west, and 9 miles in breadth from north to south. It is bounded on the east by pargana Dalmau, on the west by pargana Daundia Khera, on the south by the Ganges, and on the north by pargana Kh\u00edron.\n\nThe Bais are the chief proprietary body. R\u00e1ja Shiup\u00e1l Singh of Munr\u00e1rmau is the head taluqdars, and his taluqa is now much larger than in the kings' reign. It comprises his own hereditary one and those confiscated from the mutineers, B\u00e1bu R\u00e1m Bakhsh and R\u00e1na Beni M\u00e1dho Bakhsh. R\u00e1ja Shiup\u00e1l received these il\u00e1qas as a reward from the British Government for the good will shown and assistance rendered to the British soldiers and Major Thompson, who were found floating on the Ganges, and took refuge with the r\u00e1ja of Mur\u00e1rmau.\n\nThe proprietary system runs thus:\n\n| Taluqdari | Grant in reward | Zamindari | Pattidari |\n|-----------|-----------------|-----------|-----------|\n|           |                 |           |           |\n|           |                 |           |           |\n\n169 villages.\n\nThe area is 72,976 acres. The revenue assessed is Rs. 1,91,003-0-10, and the rate per acre on an average Rs. 2-9-11.\n\nThe population consists of all castes almost. But of the Hindu higher castes Brahmins and the Bais are numerous; the creed of the Hindus is principally Shaivi, and the Muhammadans are solely of the Sunni sect. The whole population amounts to 60,825, of whom Hindus are 59,471 and Musalmans 1,354.\n\nThere are two rivers in this pargana\u2014one the river Ganges which passes through it to the eastern boundary of pargana Dalmau; the other is the river Lon, which passes through the northern part of the pargana, and falls into the Ganges in pargana Dalmau.\n\nThere is also a stream which commences from a tank in village Bhadia, pargana Bhagwantnagar, and passing through this pargana joins the river Lon. These, however, do not aid materially in the irrigation of the soil. The soil is of three kinds\u2014loam, clay, and sand. Irrigation is chiefly carried on by wells. The products are\u2014in khar\u00edf harvest\u2014ju\u00e1r, m\u00e1sh, paddy, moth, kodo, makr\u00e1, b\u00e1jra, oil-seeds; in rabi harvest\u2014barley, gram, wheat, birra, sugarcane, peas, sarson, alsi, tobacco. There are four marts\u2014\nSareni held on Monday and Friday, Bhojpur and Chanla on Sunday and Thursday and Beni Madhoganj on Saturday and Wednesday.\n\nThere is no fair held in this pargana; climate is on the whole salubrious. During the king's reign in 16 villages salt was manufactured to the extent of 97,884 maunds and the value of Rs. 77,457, but it has now been put a stop to. Mango and mahua are the principal trees. No others need be mentioned.\n\n**SAROMANNAGAR Pargana*\u2014Tahsil Shahabad\u2014District Hardoi.**\n\nA level and well watered tract of forty-two villages lying midway between Shahabad and S\u00e1ndi along the south-eastern corner of the Shahabad tahsil, district Hardoi.\n\nThe Garra flows along its western side separating it from pargana Pali; on the south and south-east the Sukheta divides it from Barwan; on the east it is bounded by B\u00e1wan, and on the north by Shahabad. The greatest length is $8\\frac{1}{2}$ and breadth 6 miles. Its area is 35 square miles, of which 21 are cultivated. It is intersected by numerous streams; of these the Sukheta is the largest and most valuable. It runs in a loop round the north-eastern corner of the pargana, and then stretches southwards through the heart of it till, after being joined by its principal affluents, the Gauria and the Kasrua, it flows along the south-eastern boundary for about four miles, approaching to within half a mile of the Garra at the southernmost extremity of the pargana. In the dry season the Sukheta is easily fordable except where it has been dammed up for irrigation. It is crossed by an old stone bridge at Saromannagar; and at Dalelnagar, an encamping ground on the route from Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur to Unao, there is a ferry during the rains. In the hot season these streams dry up, but by a system of dams water is kept in them till March, after which month irrigation is not required.\n\nThe Garra, rising in the Himalayas, never fails. Along its bank lies a belt of rich Tar\u00e1i villages, whose land always remains moist, so that wells are scarcely required. These villages are subject to floods, and after heavy rains the autumn harvest suffers, but the loss is in such seasons made good by the increased outturn of the spring crops. To the east of these villages, about a mile away from the river, on either side of the Sukheta and its affluents, but mainly along the western bank of that stream, stretches a belt of jungle villages two miles broad. In these the soil is generally firm and good, and almost entirely free from sand, but in some places it is very stiff and hard to work.\n\nThe tillage in this tract is backward. The jungle is full of n\u00edl-g\u00e1\u00e9 and wild hogs which do infinite damage to the crops. Rents are low and cultivators somewhat scarce. Though backward this tract is highly improvable, but its villages can never become so rich as those which lie along the Garra.\n\nTo the east of this belt lies a strip of sandy, light villages, above and away from the network of streams that covers the rest of the pargana, but\n\n---\n\n* By Mr. A. H. Harington, C.S., Assistant Commissioner.\nirrigable for the most part by wells. Here the small lever-wells (dhenkli) are used. They cost from one to two rupees, and last one and sometimes two seasons. In the jungle villages these wells are also used, but the large wells worked by bullocks can be also made for from three to five rupees, and last for three years. The lever and pitcher system (dhenkli) is used all along the Garra for irrigation, and on the Sukheta, wherever the banks are too high to allow of the \"lift\" method being employed. Tanks and jhils too, of which there are 230, contribute considerably to the irrigation of the pargana. Only two-sevenths of the irrigation is from wells; 36 per cent. of the cultivated area is irrigated from wells, rivers, and ponds.\n\nOnly two roads cross the pargana, the unmetalled road from Sandi to Shahabad, a part of the old Shah-R\u0101h, or king's highway to Delhi from the south, and an unfinished road from Hardoi to Fatehgarh, which stops short half-way at the Garra, and is not kept in repair. No ferry is kept up over the Garra in this pargana. The nearest ferries are at Pali and Barwan. In the dry season it is fordable in most places.\n\nThe staple products are wheat, barley, and bajra, covering about two-thirds of the crop area. On the remainder rice, gram, and arhar are most largely cultivated. The climate is not so good as in drier tracts.\n\nThe Sombansis are the oldest and largest land owners. They hold twenty villages. Next to them come the Chamar Gaurs with fifteen. Three have been decreed to Government. Brahmans and K\u0101yaths each own two. In thirty villages the tenure is imperfect pattidari, in the remaining twelve it is zamindari. The Government demand, excluding cesses, is Rs. 22,298, being a rise of 35 per cent. over the summary assessment. The rate is Re. 1-10-5 per acre of cultivation and Re. 0-15-10 per acre of total area; Rs. 9-11-2 per plough; Rs. 2-0-11 per head of agricultural, and Re. 1-6-10 per head of total population.\n\nThe pargana is well populated with a total of 15,624 or 446 to the square mile. There are only 293 Muhammadans to 15,331 Hindus. Males to females are 8,651 to 6,973, and agriculturists to non-agriculturists 10,827 (69 per cent.) to 4,797. Rajputs, Brahmans, Cham\u0101rs, and Mur\u0101os head the list, together making up half of the Hindu population. In the other half Ah\u012brs, Kah\u0101rs, P\u0101s\u012bs, and Kis\u0101ns predominate.\n\nNo fairs are held. The only market is at Saromannagar on Sundays and Thursdays. Schools are more numerous than in many other parts of the district. There are village schools at Saromannagar, Shahpur, Nay\u0101g\u0101on, Sakrauli, and Nasauli.\n\nThe pargana is named from its only town, which was founded by R\u0101e Saroman D\u0101s in 1708 A.D. In 1803 R\u0101ja Bhaw\u0101ni Parsh\u0101d, Chakladar of Muhamdi, took villages out of the adjacent parganas of Pali and Sara, and made them into pargana Saromannagar. Like all this part of the country, it was originally occupied by Thatheras. About the middle of the twelfth century, and perhaps much earlier, the Thatheras seem to have been driven out of many of their possessions by a body of\nGaur Rajputs under the command of Kuber Sah. A little later, and about a generation before the fall of Kanauj, their expulsion was completed by the Sombansis under the following circumstances.\n\nA strong body of Sombansis headed by Raja Satan migrated southwards from Delhi and established themselves at Satan Khera (Sandi). Thence they spread over the whole of the Barwan pargana and into the Pali and (what is now) the Saromannagar country, gradually driving out the Thatheras. The local tradition is that Maw\u00e1n Sah, a Sombansi chief resident at Barwan, went out one day in search of game towards Shiupuri, a Thathera town, seven miles north of Barwan. The Thatheras resented his intrusion within their borders; there was a quarrel, and Maw\u00e1n Sah summoned his clansmen from Barwan. They drove out the Thatheras from Shiupuri, and settling there themselves renamed it Bhaiangon, since corrupted into Behgson. The name (Shiupuri) is perhaps worth noting as a possible indication that the Thatheras were worshippers of Shiva. Since then no important change seems to have taken place in the ownership of the pargana.\n\nSAROMANNAGAR*\u2014Pargana SAROMANNAGAR\u2014Tahsil SHAHABAD\u2014District HARDOI.\u2014Saromannagar, the chief village in the pargana of the same name, district Hardoi, lies 15 miles north-west from Hardoi, 6 south of Shahabad, and 18 north of Sandi, at the point where the old Sah-Rah, or king\u2019s high road from Sandi to Sahjah\u00e1npur crosses the Sukheta n\u00e1la.\n\nIt was founded in 1708 A.D. by R\u00e1e Saroman D\u00e1s, a Srib\u00e1stab K\u00e1yath of Sandi, in the employ of Nawab Abdulla Khan, the celebrated B\u00e1ra Sayyad, Governor of Allahabad, and afterwards Farukh Siari\u2019s waz\u00edr, who, with his brother Hasan Ali, \u201cmade four Tim\u00farides emperors, dethroned and killed two, and blinded and imprisoned three\u201d (Blochman\u2019s translation of the \u00c1fn-i-Akbari, page 391).\n\nIn those days a dangerous jungle surrounded G\u00e1egh\u00e1t, as the crossing of the Sukheta was then called, and the spot was of evil repute among travellers. R\u00e1e Saroman D\u00e1s bought this wild bandit-haunted tract from its owners, the Sombansis of Bhadauna, cleared it, bridged the Sukheta, and built in his own name a small fortified town. Saromannagar has a population of only 1,452, of whom 1,303 are Hindus, mostly Br\u00e1hmans. It contains two brick and 140 mud houses. A Government village school accommodating 100 pupils was built in 1868. The sar\u00e1\u00e9, wall, and bastions built by R\u00e1e Saroman D\u00e1s are in ruins. Market days are Sundays and Thursdays.\n\nReginald Heber visited Saromannagar in 1824, and has thus described it\u2020:\n\n\u201cA large village with an old fortress. The country improved in beauty, becoming more and more woody and undulating, but was neither so well\n\n* By Mr. A. H. Harington, C. S., Assistant Commissioner.\n\u2020 Heber\u2019s Journey II., page 2.\ninhabited nor so well cultivated as that which we had gone through before (S\u00e1ndi and Bilgr\u00e1m).\n\n\"The fortress is pretty much like a large sar\u0101e, surrounded by a high brick wall, with round towers at the flanks, and two gothic gateways opposite to each other.\n\n\"That by which I entered had a tall iron-studded door like a college, with a small wicket in one leaf; within on each side of the passage was a large arched recess about three feet from the ground where were seated twelve or fifteen men, armed as usual, with one or two guns, and matches lighted, but mostly having bows and arrows; all had swords and shields. I passed on through a narrow street of mud houses, some looking like warehouses, and the whole having more the air of a place where the peasantry of a small district were accustomed to secure their stores, than the usual residence of any considerable number of people. I went on to the opposite gate, which was supplied with warders in the same way as the previous one, and then entered a little straggling bazar, which, with some scattered huts, completed the hamlet.\n\n\"A pretty stream winds under the walls of Saromannagar through a beautiful carpet of green wheat interspersed with noble trees.\"\n\nThe quiet beauty of the spot moved the pious Bishop to note:\n\n\"It is strange, indeed, how much God has done to bless this land, and how perversely man has seemed bent to render his bounties unavailing.\"\n\n**SARWAN\u2014Pargana MAURANW\u00c1N\u2014Tahsil PURWA\u2014District UNAO.**\n\nThis village lies in latitude 26\u00b0 36' north, longitude 80\u00b056' east, at a distance of six miles north-east of Purwa, and 26 miles due east of Unao. It is a very old village, and the date of foundation is unknown. The site is good. There is a school here. The climate is agreeable, and water good. The population amounts to 2,183, of which Hindus amount to 2,067, and Musalmans to 116.\n\nReferring to the foundation of the village and the temple of Billesur Mah\u00e1deo, Mr. C. A. Elliott gives the following (pp. 5-6, \"Chronicles of Oonao\"):\n\n\"To worship at this temple and to shoot and hunt in the wild forest country around came Raja Duseruth from Ajoodhia, the father of Ramchundur, the fifty-seventh Raja of Ajoodhia, in direct descent from its great founder Icshwaca. He was encamped at Sarwara on the edge of a tank.\n\n\"By night came Surwun, a holy Rishi, from Chounsa (near Ajoodhia), by caste a Bunniah. He was going on pilgrimage, and was carrying his blind father and mother in a Kanwar,* slung over his shoulders. Reaching the tank he put his burden down and stopped to drink. Raja Duse-\n\n* A pair of baskets hung on a bamboo, carried on the shoulder by all pilgrims in India.\nruth heard a rustling noise, and thinking it was some wild beast, took up his bow and shot an arrow which struck Surwun and he died. Then his blind parents in their misery lifted up their voices and cursed the man who had done that thing. They prayed that as he had slain the son who was the light of their hearts, so he might have trouble and sorrow from his own children, and might die of grief even as they were dying. Having so said they gave up the ghost, and from that day to this no 'Chhattri' has lived in the town which is founded on the spot and is called Surwun. Many Rajpoots have tried it, but evil has overtaken them in one way or another. The tank remains to this day, and by it lies under a tree the body of Surwan, a figure of stone; and as he died with his thirst unquenched, so if water is poured into the navel of the stone figure, the hole can never be filled up, but is inexhaustible in its demand.\"\n\nSATAN\u2014Pargana Harha\u2014Tahsil Unao\u2014District Unao.\u2014This village is about 14 miles from the sadr station to the south-east. A river called Gurdhoi runs about a mile north of this place. Some 500 years ago, when there was jungle all over the place, a Muhammadan mendicant named S\u00e1tan lived here. A Brahman of the P\u00e1thak class was his disciple, and succeeded him after his death; having all the jungle cleared away, he founded this village and called it after his late master (S\u00e1tan.) That Brahman's descendant is still the lambardar of the village. The soil is clay and sand mixed, It is situated on a plain with scarcely any jungle in its vicinity. The appearance of the village is pleasant, climate healthy, and water good. There are many mango, bab\u00fal, and n\u00edn trees in the vicinity. There is a well and temple to Sitla Debi of very ancient date. There are two markets weekly, and one fair annually in honour of Sateswar Mah\u00e1deo lasting for one day, at which about 4,000 people assemble.\n\nPopulation:\n\n| Hindus | Brahmins | ... | ... | 673 |\n|--------|----------|-----|-----|-----|\n|        | Chhattirs| ... | ... | 6   |\n|        | P\u00e1\u00eds\u00ed    | ... | ... | 97  |\n|        | Ahirs    | ... | ... | 306 |\n|        | Other castes | ... | ... | 613 |\n|        | Total    | ... | ... | 1,584 |\n|        | Muhammadans | ... | ... | 69  |\n|        | Grand Total | ... | ... | 1,653 |\n\nThere are 340 mud-built houses and one masonry house.

The soil is good, and the place is surrounded by numerous groves.\n\nSATHAN\u2014Pargana Inhauna\u2014Tahsil Digbijaganj\u2014District Rae Bareli.\u2014This little town is pleasantly situated on high ground overlooking the Gumti, six miles north of the police station (Jagdispur), and forty miles\nnorth-west of Sultanpur. It was founded by S\u00e1than, a Bhar, and called after him, but the date of its foundation is unknown. The Moslems under Sayyad S\u00e1l\u00e1r are said to have expelled the Bhars. Shekhs and Sayyads now reside here. One Shah Abdul Lat\u00edf came after the mutiny, settled here as a missionary of pure religion; he built a mosque on high ground near the Gumti, and hundreds of the Sunnis assemble every Friday to hear his harangues. The idg\u00e1h of this town is a place of considerable resort for the faithful when the Id festival comes round. The population is 2,253, of whom only 1,028 are males. There are no temples, but one brick im\u00e1mbara erected in 1256 A.H.\n\nSATRIKH Pargana\u2014Tahsil NAWABGANJ\u2014District BARA BANKI.\u2014This pargana is bounded on the north by parganas Nawabganj and Partabganj, on the east by Siddhaur, on the west by Dewa, and on the south by Haidargarh. Its area is 46 square miles or 29,404 acres; the cultivated land amounts to 19,318 acres, and the culturable to 10,086. Of the former only 5,207 acres are irrigated. The number of villages in the pargana is 42. The prevailing soil is clay. The Gumti forms part of the western boundary; it frequently damages the khar\u00edf crops by overflowing its banks. The river takes a southerly course; its length being about 16 miles. There are 12 villages on its banks. Water is met with at six to twelve feet. The only road is an unmetalled one from Nawabganj to Satrikh town. There are three gh\u00e1ts in this pargana\u2014viz., Tikra, T\u00edrg\u00e1on, and Ibr\u00e1h\u00edmabad. The first two lead to Amethi, Goshainganj, &c., and the third is the route to the tahsil station Haidargarh. There is no trade save that in salt. Schools are established at Ibr\u00e1h\u00edmabad and Satrikh, also a branch at Lachhmanpur. There are post and registry offices at Satrikh. The Government revenue amounts to Rs. 47,986. The tenure is as follows:\n\n| Taluqdari | Zamindari | Pattidari |\n|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n|           |           |           |\n|           |           |           |\n\nThe population of the pargana amounts to 24,157, being at the rate of 525 to the square mile. Satrikh, Ibr\u00e1h\u00edmabad, and Sethmau are villages possessing a population of more than 2,000.\n\nFor the origin of the name see Satrikh town. The taluqdars of the pargana are R\u00e1ja Nawab Ali, R\u00e1ni Rukmin Kunwar, M\u00edr Buni\u00e1d Husen, and Amjad Husen, S\u00e1hib-un-nisa, and Q\u00e1zi Ikr\u00e1m Ahmad.\n\nSATRIKH\u2014Pargana SATRIKH\u2014Tahsil NAWABGANJ\u2014District BARA BANKI.\u2014This town lies 5 miles south-east of the civil station and 28 miles south of Bahramghat, in latitude 26\u00b051'20\" north, and longitude 81\u00b014'40\" east. It was founded by a Hindu R\u00e1ja, Sabtrikh, but was taken by the Musalmans in the days of Mahm\u00fad of Ghazni. S\u00e1l\u00e1r S\u00e1hu, alias Birdha B\u00e1ba, married the sister of Mahm\u00fad, and led the invaders against the town; here he died and a shrine was built in his honour. The darg\u00e1h has a rent-free grant of 54 local bighas of land for its expenses. A fair lasting two days is held here in March at which 17 to 18,000 people assemble.\nThere is a market at which the trade is chiefly in salt. There is a school, and a registry and post-office. The population amounts to 3,584; Hindus number 2,177 and Moslems 1,407.\n\n**SEOTA\u2014Pargana Kundri (North)\u2014Tahsil Bisw\u00e1n.\u2014District Sitapur**\u2014Is 32 miles due east from Sitapur, and lies four miles north of the road from that place to Chahl\u00e1ri and Bahaich. It is four miles to the east of the Chauka, and five miles west of the Gogra, both navigable rivers, and between it and the latter are several smaller streams fordable in the dry season. It was founded by \u00c1lha, a Chandel Th\u00e1kur, the story of whose expedition is generally sung in this part of the country and is styled \u201c\u00c1lha.\u201d This chieftain was a proteg\u00e9 of R\u00e1ja Jai Chand of Kanauj, and was granted possession of all the surrounding district known as G\u00e1njar. He with his patron was killed by R\u00e1e Pithaura, King of Delhi and Ajmer, who in turn was slain by Shah\u00e1b-ud-d\u00edn Ghori in 1193 A.D. There is a superstition against building a masonry house or growing sugarcane. Besides a school, there are good bazars at which the value of annual sales is Rs. 2,000. There are the ruins of a mosque, and of an ancient taluqdar\u2019s fort. On every P\u00faranm\u00e1shi a fair is held in honour of Son\u00e1ri consort to \u00c1lha. The population numbers 3,428.\n\n**SHADIPUR.\u2014Pargana Bangarmau.\u2014Tahsil Safipur.\u2014District Unao**\u2014Lies about nine miles north-west from the tahsil station and 26 miles from Unao.\n\nThere is no river or large town near; the date of its foundation is not known, but it is said that some three-hundred years ago there was one Parsh\u00e1di Guj\u00e1r living here, when the place was inhabited by Guj\u00e1rs. The R\u00e1jputs came afterwards from Shiur\u00e1jpur of Cawnpore district and brought ruin for the Guj\u00e1rs, but the name of the place was retained.\n\nThe soil is principally clay. It is on a level, and there is some jungle towards the south about one mile from the site. The appearance of the place is very agreeable. Climate healthy, and water good. Hindus and Muhammadans live amicably. There is no s\u00e1rse, th\u00e1na, tahsil, or school here. There is no bazar but three fairs in the year\u2014one in March, one in October, and one in August\u2014on account of the 8th incarnation of the deity, the great Krishna. These fairs last one day each where some 2,000 people assemble. Sweetmeats and toys are brought for sale.\n\nThere are no manufactures excepting earthenware and shoes.\n\n| Latitude | Longitude |\n|----------|-----------|\n| 26\u00b058' north | 80\u00b013' east |\n\n**SHAHABAD Pargana*\u2014Tahsil Shahabad\u2014District Hardoi.**\u2014A subdivision of tahsil Shahabad in the district of Hardoi comprising 143 villages. It is bounded on the north by the Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur district; on the west the river Garra divides it from parganas Pachhoh\u00e1 and Pali; on the south it is bounded by pargana Soromannagar; on the east the Sukh\u00e9tan\u00e1la divides it from parganas Alamnagar and Sara.\n\n* By Mr. A. H. Harington, C.S.\nIts extreme length and breadth are 14 and 11\u00bd miles, and its area 131 square miles.\n\nThree-fifths (61\u00b771 per cent.) is cultivated; more than a fifth (22\u00b71 per cent.) is culturable. About an eighth (12\u00b72 per cent.) is returned as barren.\n\nRather more than an eighth (13\u00b747) is rated as third class, i.e., sandy and light. Two-fifths of the cultivated area (41\u00b773) is irrigated in the proportion of two-thirds from wells and a third from tanks and ponds. The percentage under groves is 3\u00b799; 6\u00bd acres is the average area of cultivation per plough.\n\nAs the rivers and streams of the pargana all flow from north to south the physical features will be most conveniently observed by crossing it from west to east or vice versa. Beginning with the Garra on the west, and the villages along its left bank, the following characteristics will be noticed. The Garra, rising in the Kumaun tarai, flows past Pilibhit and Shahjah\u00e1npur across the Oudh border into pargana Shahabad. Fed with Himalayan snows it never dries up. As remarked of the Saromannagar villages which it fertilizes after leaving this pargana, \"along its bank lies a rich belt of tarai (or khadir) villages, whose land always remains moist, so that wells are scarcely required. These villages are subject to floods, and after heavy rains the autumn harvest suffers, but the loss is in such seasons made good by the increased outturn of the spring crops.\" In the dry season it is generally fordable. The lever and pot (dhenkli) system of irrigation is used all along it; wherever the bank is too high to admit of the use of the ordinary 'lift' method. Though the soil in these villages is light, they are the best in the pargana.\n\nEast of them there is the usual strip of uneven sandy villages marking the edge of the 'b\u00e1ngar' and the 'tarai.' Further east is a considerable tract of good but backward land, watered by the Narbh\u00fa and Gauria nulas holding one or two large jhils, and thickly interspersed, in the southern half of the pargana, with dh\u00e1k jungle and brushwood.\n\nThe soil here is firm and good and retentive of water, and bears fine rice crops, but wild animals do much damage in the jungle parts, and rents are low and cultivators rather scarce. This tract will gradually improve. Large wells worked by bullocks can be cheaply dug in it for from three to five rupees, and last about three years. Further to the east the quality of the soil falls off, becoming light and poor. Towards the Sukheta, which forms the eastern boundary, a quantity of 'dh\u00e1k' and thorn jungle is met with, full of nil-g\u00e1c, wild hog, hare, pea-fowl, partridge, and bush quail. The cost of protecting the crop from the depredation of jungle animals is a heavy drag on the cultivator.\n\nThe Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway runs through the pargana, with a station near Shahabad. The road (unmetalled) from Shahjah\u00e1npur to Hardoi also runs through it, parallel with and about two miles west of the railway. From Shahabad other unmetalled roads branch off from it\nto Pali, Sandi, and Pihani. The road from Sitapur to Shahjahanpur via Pihani crosses the north-eastern corner.\n\nThe chief products are wheat, barley, bajra, gram, juar, paddy, arhar and sugarcane. Of these at survey wheat occupied nearly a third of the acreage under cultivation; barley covered a tenth; bajra nearly a tenth; gram, juar and paddy together, nearly a fourth. The areas returned as under cane, cotton, poppy, tobacco, and indigo were respectively, 2,928, 1,292, 129, 36, and 5 acres. The nearness of the Rosa Factory at Shahjahanpur accounts for the large breadth of sugarcane.\n\nThe climate is considered good.\n\nThe 143 villages are thus held\u2014\n\n| Community       | Number |\n|-----------------|--------|\n| Sombansis       | 4      |\n| Chamar-Gaurs    | 14\u00bd    |\n| Nikumbha        | 3      |\n| Total Chhatris  | 21\u00bd    |\n| Tiwari Brahmins | 3      |\n| Misra           | 3      |\n| Pathaks         | 8      |\n| Pandes          | 5      |\n| Tirbedis        | 8      |\n| Agnhotris       | 6      |\n| Barmbeharis     | 2      |\n| Upaddhlas       | 1      |\n| Total Brahmins  | 25\u00bd    |\n| Shekhs          | 4      |\n| Sayyads         | 4      |\n| Pathans         | 64     |\n| Total Muhammadans | 72   |\n| Kayaths         | 9      |\n| Goshain         | 1      |\n| European (Mesar, Carew) | 1 |\n| Government      | 13     |\n| Total Miscellaneous | 24 |\n\n26 of the villages are taluqdari, 82 are zamindari, 35 pattidari.\n\nThe Government demand, excluding cesses, is Rs. 98,426\u2014a rise of 30 per cent. over the summary assessment. It falls at Re. 1-12-11 on the cultivated acre, Re. 1-1-10 per acre of total area, Rs. 11-8-4 per plough, Rs. 2-3-4 per head of agricultural, and Re. 1-6-1 per head of total population.\n\nPopulation is extremely dense\u2014516 to the square mile. The leading statistics are total 67,646; Hindus to Muhammadans, 56,187 to 11,459; males to females, 35,894 to 31,752; agriculturists to non-agriculturists 42,297 to 25,349.\n\nBrahmans are most numerous, and are an eighth of the whole; Chamars are rather less than an eighth; Lodhas a tenth; Muraos a twentieth; Ahirs-Chhatris 2,523; Kahars, Telis, and Pasis make up most of the remainder.\nThere is an Anglo-veracular tahsil school at Shahabad, and village schools at Udranpur Parial, Fatehpur Goind, B\u00e1sitnagar, Puraili, and Bari, and female schools have been established at Udranpur and Parial.\n\nThe pargana is not mentioned in the Ain-i-Akbari, not having been constituted till about 1745 A.D., when the villages to the east of the Garra in what was then pargana Pali were made into a new pargana (Shahabad).\n\nThe leading events have been the expulsion of the Thatheras, the growth and spread of their Chhattiri successors, the successful campaign of Diler Khan, and the foundation of Shahabad and of the Path\u00e1n taluqa of B\u00e1sitnagar.\n\nThe chief Thathera settlement seems to have been at and round Angni Khera, the nucleus of the present town of Shahabad. It consisted of twenty-six villages surrounding a fort named Shabazpur, Todarpur, Nizampur, Sorapur, Jangpur, Muh\u00faudd\u00ednpur, Chaudhripur, Dal\u00e1walpur, Mahehpur, Ch\u00e1ndpur Khokar, Ni\u00e1matpur, H\u00e1labpur H\u00e1ns, Bibipur Gautar, Bibipur Udhaukal, Bah\u00e1durpur, Malikpur, Nahok B\u00e1ra, Jam\u00e1lpur, Kautaisa, Chand Thok, Muhammadipur alias Jam\u00e1lpur, Thok D\u00e1l\u00fa, Khandi, Mominpur, Yusufpur, and Malhaia. These names are obviously modern.\n\nThe conquest of this settlement is attributed to a pilgrim band of P\u00e1nde Parw\u00e1r Brahmins, who on their way from K\u00e1shi (Benares) to Hardw\u00e1r halted here, noticed the weakness of the Thatheras, and on their way back fell upon and dispossessed them; who these P\u00e1nde Parw\u00e1rs were is a mystery. The tradition gives only the name of their leader Angad, and traces their origin to a Kori, who, from the accident of his being found with a thread (t\u00e1g\u00e1) on his body, when Brahmins were in great request for a royal \u201cjagg,\u201d got irregularly enrolled among the P\u00e1nde Brahmins, and was dubbed P\u00e1nde Parw\u00e1r. The date of this displacement of the Thatheras may be presumed to have been synchronous with the great Brahmanical revival which set in with the sacking of Sarn\u00e1th, and the expulsion of the Buddhist monks from India in the eighth century.\n\nTo the P\u00e1nde leader Angad is traced Angni Khera, the name whereby the ruined site of their town is called, and Angad Khera, a spot which, it is said, was the \u201cakh\u00e1ra\u201d or \u201ccampus martius,\u201d where the P\u00e1nde youths used to hold their athletic sports.\n\nThe only surviving Thathera name is to be found in the Tank Ratauka, derived from R\u00e9\u00e9 Th\u00e1n, or the seat of R\u00e9\u00e9, a Thathera prince.\n\nThe Path\u00e1n, Ghoris of Jamra, claim to be converted Sombansis. Their tradition goes to show that the Muhammadan conquest took place before the Thatheras by Chhattiris had been completed, R\u00e9\u00e9 Santan Sombansi they say, of S\u00e1ntan Khera (S\u00e1ndi), had four sons who ruled at Barwan, at Siwaichpur, at Semar Jhala, and at Raigaw\u00e1n. D\u00e1l\u00edp Singh, of Raigaw\u00e1n, fought against Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn Ghori for twelve years.\n\nAt last while out in search of game he was taken captive and carried to the Muhammadan Sultan, and imprisoned at Delhi for twelve years.\nThen his brother ransomed him. On his return home his kinsmen treated him as an outcast till he should propitiate the Brahmans.\n\nIn spite of his protestations that he had not become a pervert during his captivity his brethren held aloof from him, and when at last prevailed upon to eat with him, drew a line of demarcation on the floor. Stung deeply with the affront, he renounced the faith of his fathers before them all, took horse for Delhi, sought the Sultan, told the tale, and announced his desire to become a Muhammadan. Whereupon he was admitted as a convert, was named Mi\u00e1n Dilpasand Khan, and honoured with a grant of eighty-four villages, among the chief of which were Fatehpur Goind, Aigaw\u00e1n, Adranpur, Maujhala, and Loni.\n\nAnd in those days two and twenty Thathera chieftains still ruled from Angni Khera to the Sarju, against whom he warred with great renown.\n\nAnd he died leaving four sons, of whom Mustafa Khan dwelt at Loni, and there his descendants are to this day; and Daulat Khan lived at Piani, and Jajhar Khan at Raigaw\u00e1n, and Mahm\u00fad Khan at Jamra.\n\nThe Bais under-proprietors of Bhairaia relate a third displacement of Thatheras in this pargana from Pair\u00e1s and Deor\u00e1s and the adjacent forest by their ancestor Pahalw\u00e1n Singh, who, married to the sister of R\u00e1ja Satmor, left Baisw\u00e1ra, and sought distinction in his wife's country.\n\nThe P\u00e1nde Parw\u00e1rs retained possession of Angni Khera and the neighbourhood till the reign of Aurangzeb. In an evil moment they plundered a convoy of treasure on its way from Khairabad to Delhi. The Sultan despatched Diler Khan Afgh\u00e1n, a distinguished officer, to repress the bandits arriving at Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur, recently founded, and then, commanded by his brother Bah\u00e1dur Khan, Diler Khan rode out alone towards Angni Khera to reconnoitre. Smitten with thirst he begged water of an ancient crone. The gift of two gold mohars loosened a garulous tongue, and he learned from her the strength and ways of the P\u00e1nde Parw\u00e1rs. In particular he heard that on a certain date the whole tribe mustered at the old Thathera tank Ratauha to bathe. Returning to Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur he mustered a strong force, marched secretly to Angni Khera on the night of the bathing, and surrounded and slew the unsuspecting Brahmans. In reward for his skill and daring he was granted the whole of their possessions in pargana Shahabad and Sara in j\u00e1g\u00edr, and became Naw\u00e1b Diler Khan Bah\u00e1dur Haft Haz\u00e1ri, or commander of seven thousand. His descendants held the grant rent-free till Sa\u00edd\u00e1t Ali Khan resumed it. In 1877 A.D., he founded the city of Shahabad on Angni Khera, filled it with his Afgh\u00e1n kinsmen and troops, assigning them jungle grants in the neighbourhood: and in the midst raised the spacious mansion known as the Bari Deorhi. Fifty-two wards or muhallas trace their present names to the followers who then built in the places on which they stand.\n\nThe further progress of the family has been thus described by Captain Gordon Young in his settlement decision regarding the village of Dariapur.\n\"These Nawabs acquired either by purchase, mortgage, fraud, or force every village in the pargana, and held as proprietors till fifty or sixty years ago, when the family began to decay and the taluqa to fall to bits, the old proprietors in a few instances getting back, mostly by purchase from the Nawab's family. The sales made by the Nawabs were generally followed by possession. There was no question at that time as to whether they had the right to sell. They sold, and the vendees got in and held and the title was respected. In dealing with the transactions of those days one is reminded of the stanza\u2014\n\n'The good old rule sufficeth them,\u2014\nThe simple plan,\nThat those should take who have the power,\nAnd those should keep who can.'\n\nElsewhere the same officer writes:\u2014\n\n\"The sons of Nawab Diler Khan were four\u2014namely, Kam\u00e1lud-d\u00edn Khan, Ch\u00e1nd Khan, Dild\u00e1r Khan, and Fateh Muhammad Khan.\n\n\"The eldest son and his sons have always been known as the 'Bari Deorhi W\u00e1las' from the large fort he built, and this appellation still appertains to this branch of the family, which is now represented by Sarfr\u00e1z Husen Khan and Ahmad Husen Khan. The descendants of Ch\u00e1nd Khan are known as the 'Khera Deorhi W\u00e1las.' Dild\u00e1r Khan's branch is represented by the present taluqdar (of B\u00e1sitnagar) Nawab Husen Ali Khan.\"\n\nSHAHABAD*\u2014Pargana SHAHABAD\u2014Tahsil SHAHABAD\u2014District HARDOI.\u2014Latitude 27\u00b038' north, longitude 79\u00b059'. The chief town of the pargana of the same name in the Hardoi district. Thornton's account of it is:\u2014\"A town on the route from Lucknow to Shahjehanpur, 15 miles south of the latter and 30 miles north-east of Futtehgurh.\" Tieffenthaler describes it, about A.D. 1770, \"of considerable circuit, and nearly in the middle is a palace of brick, strengthened with towers like a fortress, with a vestibule and spacious covered colonnade. Most of the houses are of brick, and there is a fine mosque built of the same material, and inclosed by a wall. The town extends a mile from north to south; its breadth is something less, but of its flourishing state little remains.\" When visited by Tennant, A.D. 1799, it was an expanse of ruins \"that appeared in the form of hills and broken swells crumbling to dust.\" Heber found it, in 1824, \"a considerable town or almost city, with the remains of fortifications and many large houses.\" According to Tieffenthaler, \"it was founded by Angad, the nephew of Rama, king of Oudh, and if so; must be of high antiquity, as Rama is considered to have reigned 1600 years B.C.; hence it is sometimes called Angadpur. It was renovated by Dil\u00e1war Khan, an Afghan chief, contemporary with Aurangzeb. At present it has a bazar and encamping ground, close to which are two tanks lined with brick. The road to the north or towards Shahjah\u00e1npur is good; to the south-east, or towards Lucknow, very bad.

Its present population is said to be only a third of its former size. It is connected with Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur, Pali, S\u00e1ndi, Hardoi, and Pih\u00e1n\u00ed by unmetalled roads, and the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway passes close to it, and has a station here.\n\nThe subdivisional office (tahsil) and police station (th\u00e1na) are located in the enclosure of the J\u00e1ma Masjid\u2014a mosque built by Diler Khan. Among other buildings are an Anglo-veracular tahsil school, a dispensary, and a sar\u00e9 built originally by R\u00e1e Mangli L\u00e1l, Chakladar, and repaired by the present Government.\n\nBathing fairs are held at the old Thathera pool, Raitanha, and at a masonry tank built by Diler Khan and called Narbada, because water from that river was poured into it when it was opened, but they are not attended by pilgrims from any distance.\n\nThere is no trade or manufacture of importance; for sugar, the most valuable product of the neighbourhood, is worked up at the Rosa Factory at Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur. Bazars are held in Sard\u00e1rganj, Jam\u00e1l Khan's Ganj, Namak Mandi, Roshan Bazar, Nih\u00e1lganj, D\u00edlerganj, Sas\u00e1datganj, called also Katra, the Chauk, Maul\u00e1ganj, and Mahm\u00fadganj. Mahm\u00fadganj has been opened since annexation, and a daily grain market is held in it. The town is noted for its excellent mangoes, and grafts are exported to a distance. A native cloth called 'Mahm\u00fadi' used to be manufactured here and was much prized.\n\nSir W. Sleeman's account of Shahabad (1850) is worth extracting, as it gives the origin of the chronic ill-feeling between Muhammadans and Hindus which has smouldered ever since, and broke out into active disorder at the Muharram of 1868:\n\n\"Palee is a good place for a cantonment, or seat of public civil establishments, and Shahabad is no less so. The approach to both, from the\nsouth-east, is equally beautiful, from the rich crops which cover the ground up to the houses, and the fine groves and majestic single trees which surround them.\n\n\"Shahabad is a very ancient and large town, occupied chiefly by Pathan Mussulmans, who are a very turbulent and fanatical set of fellows. Subsookh R\u00e1e, a Hindu, and the most respectable merchant in the district, resided here, and for some time consented to officiate, as the deputy of poor old Hafiz Abdoollah, for the management of the town where his influence was great. He had lent a good deal of money to the heads of some of the Pathan families of the town, but finding few of them disposed to repay, he was last year obliged to refuse further loans. They determined to take advantage of the coming mohurrum festival to revenge the affront as men commonly do who live among such a fanatical community. The tazeens are commonly taken up and carried in procession ten days after the new moon is first seen at any place where they are made; but in Oudh all go by the day in which the moon is seen from the capital of Lucknow. As soon as she is seen at Lucknow, the king issues an order throughout his dominions for the tazeens to be taken in procession ten days after. The moon was this year in November first seen on the 30th of the month at Lucknow, but at Shahabad where the sky is generally clearer she had been seen on the 29th. The men to whom Subsookh R\u00e1e had refused further loans determined to take advantage of this incident to wreak their vengeance; and when the deputy promulgated the king's order for the tazeens to be taken in procession ten days after the 30th, they instigated all the Mahommedans of the town to insist upon taking them out ten days after the 29th, and persuaded them that the order had been fabricated, or altered, by the malice of their Hindoo deputy to insult their religious feelings. They were taken out accordingly, and having to pass the house of Subsookh R\u00e1e, when their excitement, or spirit of religious fervour had reached the highest pitch, they there put them down, broke open the doors, entered in a crowd, and plundered it of all the property they could find, amounting to about seventy thousand rupees. Subsookh R\u00e1e was obliged to get out, with his family, at a back door, and run for his life. He went to Shajehanpoor, in our territory, and put himself under the protection of the magistrate. Not content with all this, they built a small miniature mosque at the door with some loose bricks, so that no one could go either out or in without the risk of knocking it down, or so injuring this mock mosque as to rouse, or enable the evil-minded to rouse, the whole Mahommedan population against the offender. Poor Subsookh R\u00e1e has been utterly ruined, and ever since seeking in vain for redress. The Government is neither disposed nor able to afford it, and the poor boy who has now succeeded his learned father in the contract is helpless. The little mock mosque, of uncemented bricks, still stands as a monument of the insolence of the Mahommedan population, and the weakness and apathy of the Oudh Government.\"\u2014(p.p. 46\u201447, Tour through Oudh, Volume II.)\n\nSHAH\u00c1B-UD-DIN-ABAD\u2014Purgana M\u00e1nikpur\u2014Tahsil Kunda\u2014District Partabgarh.\u2014This place was founded on the bank of the Ganges by R\u00e1ja Sayyad Abdul Q\u00e1dir M\u00edr \u00c1dil. See the history of pargana M\u00e1nikpur.\nIt is 36 miles from Partabgarh. A magnificent palace was erected here; part of it has fallen down, part been carried away by the river, but enough remains to attest the magnificence and taste of the founder. A long stately front of red stone from Fatehpur Sikri is varied by several buildings, the hall of forty columns, the hall of colours and others; these have balconies boldly projecting over the river with finely carved columns and delicate tracing. Population,\u20141,106 Hindus; 153 Musalmans; total 1,259.\n\nThere are 103 masonry houses, two temples to Mah\u00e1deo, and four mosques.

The soil is good, and the climate healthy, but the country is rather bare of trees. The population is 2,672, of whom 428 are Brahmans, 351 Chhattirs. There is a weekly market; the sales average about 400 rupees.\n\nSIDDHAUR Pargana*\u2014Tahsil NAWABGANJ AND HAIDARGARH\u2014District BARA BANKI.\u2014This pargana is bounded on the north by Partabganj, on the east by S\u00farajpur pargana, on the south by Haidargarh and Subeha, and on the west by Satirkh. Its area is 141 square miles, or 64,474 acres. Of cultivated land there are 44,225, and of uncultivated 20,249 acres. The irrigated area is 26,263, and the unirrigated 37,049 acres. The villages lying close to the Gumti are uneven; the land is also cut up by ravines. The soil is chiefly loam. The climate is good. The Gumti borders the pargana on the south; it flows from east to west, having a course of 30 miles. There is a stream (the R\u00e1ri) also in the interior of the pargana flowing for 12 miles through it. There are about 30 villages lying along the banks of the Gumti. The road from Nawabganj to Debiganj and Haidargarh passes through this pargana, and another from the chief town to the Daryabad and Safarganj stations. There are seven ferries\n\n* Half in Nawabganj and half in Haidargarh tahsils.\non the Gumti; country cloth is the only item of export. There are seven schools; the post and registry offices are at Siddhaur.

Siddhaur and Bibipur are the only villages possessing a population of above 2,000 souls.\n\nThis pargana had its origin in the time of Akbar Shah. The Bhars were the original occupants; they were expelled by the Moslems at the time of the invasion of Masa\u00fad. The Sayyads form a great part of the population. The taluqdars of the pargana are P\u00e1nde Sarabjit Singh, W\u00e1jid Husen, and Ahmad Husen, Amjad Husen, R\u00e1ja Farzand Ali Khan, Hak\u00edm Karam Ali, B\u00e1b\u00ed Bech-un-nisa, Th\u00e1kur Shiu Sahae, R\u00e1ni Lekhr\u00e1j Kunwar, and Ghul\u00e1m Q\u00e1sim Khan.\n\nSleeman writes as follows:\n\n\"February 26th, 1850, Sidhore, sixteen miles west south-west. The country a plain, covered as usual with spring crops and fine foliage; but intersected midway by the little river Kuleeanee, which causes undulations on each side. The soil chiefly dumatand light, but fertile. It abounds more in white ants than such light soil generally does. We passed through the estate of Soorujpoor Behrelee, in which so many of the baronial robbers above described reside, and through many villages beyond it, which they had lately robbed and burnt down, as far as such villages can be burnt. The mud-walls and coverings are as good as bomb-proofs against the fire, to which they are always exposed from these robbers. Only twenty days ago, Chundee Behraleea and his party attacked the village of Siswae, through which we passed a few miles from this plundered it, and killed three persons, and six others perished in the flames. They served several others in the neighbourhood in the same manner; and have within the same time attacked and plundered the town of Sidhore itself several times.\n\n\"The boundary which separates the Dureeabad from the Sidhore district we passed some four miles back; and the greater part of the villages lately attacked are situated in the latter, which is under a separate Amil, Aga Ahmud, who is in consequence unable to collect his revenue. The Amil of Dureeabad, Girdhara Sing* on the contrary acquiesces in all the atrocities committed by these robbers, and is in consequence able to collect his revenue and secure the favour of the court. Some of the villages of the estate held by the widow of Singjoo, late Raja of Soorujpoor, are under the jurisdic-\n\n* Girdhara Sing's patron is Chundee Sahae, the minister's deputy, whose influence is paramount at present.\ntion of the Sidhore Amil; and, as she would pay no revenue, the Amil took\na force a few days ago to her twelve villages of Sonowlee, within the\nDureeabad district, and seized and carried off some three hundred of her\ntenants, men, women, and children, as hostages for the payment of the\nbalance due, and confined them pell-mell in a fort. The clamour of the\nrest of the population as I passed was terrible; all declaring that they had\npaid their rents to the Ranee, and that she alone ought to be held responsi-\nble. She, however, resided at Soorujpoor within the jurisdiction and under\nthe protection of the Amil of Dureeabad.\n\n\"The Behraleea gangs have lately plundered the five villages of Sadut-\npoor, Luloopoor, Bilkhundee, and Subahpoor, belonging to Soorujbulee, the\nhead canoongo, or chowdheree of Dureeabad, who had never offended them.\nBoth the Amils were with me for the latter part of the road; and the dispute\nbetween them ran very high. It was clear, however, that Girdhara Sing\nwas strong in his league with the robbers, and conscious of his being able\nto maintain his ground at court; and Aga Ahmad was weak in his efforts\nto put them down, and conscious of his being unable much longer to pay\nwhat was required, and keep his post. He has with him two companies of\nNajeeks and two of Telingas and eight guns. The guns are useless, and\nwithout ammunition or stores of any kind; and the Najeeks and Telingas\ncannot be depended upon. The best paymaster has certainly the best\nchance. It is humiliating and distressing to see a whole people suffering\nsuch wrongs as are every day inflicted upon the village communities and\ntowns people of Dureeabad, Rodowlee, Sidhore, and Dewa, by these merci-\nless freebooters; and impossible not to feel indignant at a Government that\nregards them with so much indifference.\"\u2014(\"Sleeman's tour through\nOudh,\" Vol. II., pages 316-318.)\n\nSIDDHAUR\u2014Pargana SIDDHAUR\u2014Tahsil HAYDARGARH\u2014District BARA\nBANKI.\u2014This town lies 16 miles west of the civil Station and 24 from\nBahramghat in latitude 26\u00b046' north, longitude 81\u00b026'10\" east.

The original name of it was Burh\u0101npur, but in A.D. 1297 Sikandar Khan, an agent of Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn, altered the name to Sikandarpur. In 1535 A.D. this pargana was held by Harju Mal Dhobi (washerman), but in the reign of Sh\u00e9r Shah in 1540 he was killed by Medni Mal, Parih\u00e1r Th\u00e1kur of Jigni, from whom the present taluqdar, Gop\u00e1l Singh, descends. The Parih\u00e1r Th\u00e1kurs of this pargana are thus described by Mr. Elliott:\n\n\"The present Purihars in the Unao district inhabit the pargana of Surosee, or as it has recently become habitual to call it Secunderpore, and possess the mystic number of 84 villages\u2014a tract of land which is called a Chowrassie. According to their local traditions they came from a place called Jiginie (which is not to be found on the map), or Sarinagur, i.e., Cashmere.\n\n\"From that high hill country they were driven, we know not by what cause to inhabit the sandy plains of Marwar; expelled thence, they were broken into innumerable little principalities, which found no abiding place, and have undergone continual changes, till we meet with a small portion of the clan who settled comparatively a short time ago in a little corner of Oudh, and even here the name of the beautiful valley from which they came ten centuries ago is still common in the mouths of men.\n\n\"The story of the settling of the ancestors of the clan in Surosee is thus told. About three hundred years ago, in the time of Hum\u00e1y\u00fan, king of Delhi, a Dikhit girl from Purenda was married to the son of the Purihar Raja, who lived in Jiginie across the Jumna. The bridegroom came with a large escort of his friends and brotherhood to celebrate the marriage, and the party on their journey passed through Surosee.\n\n\"As they sat down around a well (the locality of which is still shown though the well has fallen in), they asked who were the lords of the fort which stood not far off. They were told that the fort was held by Dhobies (washermen) and other Soodurs who owned the neighbouring country. The procession then went on to Purenda, and returning conducted the bride to her home. Just before the Holie festival a party headed by Bhag\u00e9 Singh returned, waited for the evening of that riotous feast, and then, when the guards of the fort were heavy with wine, and no danger was looked for, suddenly attacked and slaughtered them, and made themselves masters of the fort and the surrounding country.\n\n\"Bhag\u00e9 Singh had four sons, and they divided the eighty-four villages he had conquered at his death. Asees and Salhu, the two eldest sons, took the largest portion of the estate; twenty villages falling to the former and to the latter forty-two.\"\n\"The third son, Manik, was a devotee, and refused to be troubled with worldly affairs. All he asked for was one village on the banks of the Ganges, where he might spend his life in worship, and wash away his sins three times a day in the holy stream. The youngest son, Bhooleldhan, was quite a boy at the time of his father's death, and took what share his brothers chose to give him, and they do not seem to have treated him badly.\n\n\"The law of primogeniture did not exist among the family, and every son, as he grew up and married, claimed his right to a separate share of his father's inheritance, and thus the ancestral estate constantly dwindled as fresh slices were cut off it, till at last the whole family were a set of impoverished gentlemen, who kept up none of the dignity which had belonged to the first conquerors, Bhag\u00e9 Singh and his sons. For six generations they stagnated thus, no important event marking their history till the time of Heera Singh.\n\n\"The family property in his time had grown very small, and he had five sons to divide it amongst; and to add to his misfortunes he was accused of some crime, thrown into prison at Fyzabad, and loaded with chains. With the chains on his legs he escaped, arrived safely at Surosee, and lay in hiding there. His pride being thus broken, he resolved to send his third son, Kulunder Singh, to take service in the Company's army. He rose to be Soobadar Major in the 49th Regiment of Native Infantry, and in this position, through his supposed influence with the Resident, became a very considerable man. He knew that as long as he was at hand, no chukladar would venture to treat the Purihar zemindars with injustice; but on his death they would be again at the mercy of the local authorities.\n\n\"He therefore collected all the members of the brotherhood who were descended from Asees, and persuaded them to mass their divided holdings nominally into one large estate, of which his nephew, Golab Singh, should be the representative talookdar; so that while in reality each small shareholder retained sole possession of his own share, they should present the appearance of a powerful and united talooka making Golab Singh their nominal head. Thus the chukladars would be afraid to touch a man, who seemed to hold so large an estate, though in reality he only enjoyed a small portion of it. The brotherhood consented to this, and from 1840 till annexation the estate was held in the name of Golab Singh alone, and they had no further trouble from the oppressions of the chukladars.\"\n\n\"Elliott's Chronicles of Oonao\" pages 58-60.\n\nGolab Singh is now the recognized Taluqdar of Sarausi.\n\nSIKANDARPUR\u2014Pargana Sikandarpur\u2014Tahsil Unao\u2014District Unao.\u2014This village, which has a population of 1,679 gives name to the pargana.

Khattris got this place rent-free from Akbar.\n\nPrior to this one Sayyad Taj settled here and dug a tank; a tomb in an island within this tank still bears an inscription dated 1365 A.D., one of the oldest in Oudh.\n\nIt is a picturesque spot on the high bank of the Tons, opposite Akbarpur, 36 miles from Fyzabad on the road to Jaunpur, here crossed by the road from Sultanpur to Gorakhpur.\n\nThere are numerous groves here. A great family of Khatri bankers, headed by Gajidhar Mal and Shiubans Rae, formerly flourished here.\n\nThe population is 5,069, of whom 2,021 are Sunnis, 84 are Shias, 2,964 are Hindus.\n\nThere are 916 houses, of which 24 are of masonry.

The rise of the raja's family is recent, and the village once, together with the 27 villages that formed the pargana, are said to have belonged to a clan of Gautams, an offshoot of the Argal raj, who must have established a colony here in very early times; for their ancestor, Bhuraj Singh, is said to have led an expedition, as a servant of the Raja of Kanauj, against the Bhrs of a neighbouring village, who had the presumption to propose an alliance with the daughter of a Janwar chief. The Janwar appealed to Bhuraj Singh, who was leading a marriage procession through the neighbourhood, for help, and it resulted in the invasion and conquest of the pargana by the Gautams. In the village there is a small heap of stones worshipped under the name of Bhura Baba, probably the same as Bhuraj Singh; but the name of the village seems to have been given to it by Shiu Singh, his son, if it be not due to some more mythic origin for the worship of Shiva under his emblem seems to prevail very extensively in the village.\n\nThe population is chiefly Hindu in which there are a great many Brahmins. The Musalman element is very small. The total population is 3,140 the and number of houses is 723, of which a very few are masonry. But in the centre of the village the raja has built an imposing edifice. Notwithstanding that it was known as the headquarters of a pargana, it never attained to any importance. There are the usual trades carried on in the village, and a good deal of traffic passes through it direct for Unao, to which\nplace a road, with a bridge over the Sai, has been made, and by a rough country road that meets the Mohanlalganj and Bani road at about six miles to the west of Sissaindi.

This embraces the whole of the present division of Sitapur, including the three districts Kheri, Sitapur, Hardoi, with the exception of a row of parganas on the extreme south. Kachhandan, Bilgram, Mallawan, Sandila, Gorinda, and Gundwa, are now in Hardoi; Bar, and Bilahra, now Mahmudabad are in Sitapur. They were formerly in the Sark\u00e1r Lucknow.

In only two parganas the old owners are still found; in that of Gopamau the then proprietary body, the Ch\u00e1war or Abban-Chhattis, still retain a portion of their possessions; the Sombansi also now hold part of S\u00e1ndi. The B\u00e1chhil Chhattis who held Bas\u00e1ra, Sandfla, Bisw\u00e1n, Sadrpur, Machhrehta, and part of Khairigarh now do not possess any lands in those parganas. Similarly the Bisens have disappeared from Khairigarh and Kheri. Ah\u00edrs no longer hold N\u00edmkhar or Garh Qila Nawa. It is not that these tribes have gone elsewhere; they have died out, or become mere tenants-at-will.\n\nOne or two Chhatti tribes have prospered mightily; of such are the Gaurs who then had only Sitapur, but now have Sitapur, L\u00e1harpur, Chan-dra, Harg\u00e1m, B\u00e1wan, Barwan, Sara, in main part; the Chauh\u00e1n Janw\u00e1rs of \u00d3el, who then had no villages and now have over 300; the Nikumbh, Kati\u00e1r, and J\u00e1ngre, who now have several parganas and formerly had none. It is, however, the Musalmans who have made the greatest progress. They now hold 1,445 villages in this division. In Akbar's time only Bilgr\u00e1m is mentioned as being partly the property of the Sayyads. They probably had not more than 50 villages. In fact, as elsewhere remarked, the Musalmans never aimed at acquiring property in land till the latter end of Akbar's time; and this is the reason that no deeds of mortgage or sale can be found bearing a date prior to his reign. Musalmans then aimed at getting rent-free land granted them for life only. Since Akbar's time, and above all during Alamgir's reign, Musalmans have been gradually acquiring large estates over Khairabad and everywhere in Oudh except in Baisw\u00e1ra. They have spread out from each town\u2014from Sandila, S\u00e1ndi, Shahabad, Bilgr\u00e1m, Mahmudabad, Aurangabad, Kheri; during Shuj\u00e1-ud-daula's reign Musalmans held probably two-thirds of the whole country. The reaction which took place since Sa\u00e1dat Ali Khan's time deprived them of much of their property, but they still hold estates far beyond the proportion which might be expected from their numbers and influence.\n\nAnother remarkable matter in Khairabad is the fixity of the internal divisions. In a few cases ancient parganas have been broken up into several small ones, but there has been no wholesale uprooting of ancient land marks and redistribution of the lands. The reason is not far to seek. The great taluqdars who acquired possession of eastern Oudh, and who in many cases paid tribute and allegiance to the central Government just when it suited them, considered each man's property as a separate estate, in which the owner was to exercise authority civil and criminal, and for which the Government revenue was to be paid separately. In fact, local government superseded central, and consequently the territorial jurisdictions of local magnates superseded the ancient divisions. The former were very generally called after their owner's name or after his favourite fortalice; he was never satisfied till he had rebaptized the territory and got the new name entered in the Government records. So Partabgarh, Parsh\u00e1depur, Gh\u00e1tampur, Dal\u00edppur, Mohanganj, Bhagwantnagar, Mohanlalganj, were called after various chiefs of south-east Oudh; and Dhingwas, R\u00e1mpur, Ateha, Daundia Khera, Haidargarh after their forts; in each case displacing, split-\nting up, and blending in new combinations the older subdivisions. Nothing of the kind took place in Khairabad, at least not to such an extent. No great Hindu barons rose to power and remade the map of Hardoi or Kheri. L\u00e1harpur and Mahmudabad are instances in Sitapur of how powerful Gours and Musalmans did break up ancient divisions, superseding in fact the pargana or country by the muh\u00e1l or estate. Khairabad was afterwards broken up under the Oudh kings into the chakladaris of S\u00e1ndi, Pali, Tandiaon, Muhamdi, Khairabad.\nSITAPUR DISTRICT ARTICLE.\n\nABSTRACT OF CHAPTERS.\n\nI.\u2014GENERAL ASPECTS. II.\u2014AGRICULTURE AND COMMERCE. III.\u2014THE PEOPLE. IV.\u2014ADMINISTRATION. V.\u2014HISTORY.\n\nCHAPTER I.\nPHYSICAL FEATURES.\n\nBoundaries, area\u2014General aspect\u2014Soil\u2014Subdivisions\u2014Rivers\u2014Groves\u2014Jhils\u2014Jungles\u2014Vegetable products\u2014Wild animals\u2014Mineral products\u2014Fauna\u2014Game birds\u2014Temperature\u2014Winds\u2014Climate\u2014Rainfall\u2014Medical aspects.\n\nBoundaries and area.\u2014The district of Sitapur which takes its name from the country town of the same name, lies between the parallels of 27\u00b053' and 27\u00b07' north latitude, and 80\u00b021' and 81\u00b026' east longitude. Situated in the interior of Oudh, it is bounded on the north by the Kheri district on the east by that of Bhaich, from which it is separated by the great river Gogra; on the south by districts Bara Banki and Lucknow; and on the west by Hardoi; the river Gumti being the common boundary of both.\n\nIn shape like an ellipse, its greatest length from south-east to north-west is 70 miles, and its extreme breadth from north-east to south-west 55; its area is 2,250* square miles. Its population is 932,959, being at the rate of 414 to the square mile. There have been no changes in the area of the district; its capital bears the same name.\n\nPhysical features and characteristics of the soil.\u2014Without hills or valleys, devoid of forests and lakes, properly so called, the district presents the appearance of a vast plain; well wooded through the numerous groves and scattered trees with which it is covered; well cultivated save in those parts where the soil is barren and cut up by ravines; intersected by numerous streams, and possessing many of those shallow ponds and natural reservoirs of water which in the rains are full to overflowing, but in the hot season become dry, and which are called jhils in the vernacular tongue. A plain, it slopes imperceptibly from an elevation of 505 feet above the level of the sea in the north-west to 400 feet above the level, in the south-east, the fall being just 1\u00bd foot in each mile.\n\nSoil.\u2014With the exception of the eastern parganas, which lie in the duab of the Gogra and Chauka, the soil of the district is as a rule dry. In many parts, especially in the neighbourhood of the larger rivers, we meet with tracts of sand; barren land \"risar\" is found all over the district; the lands close to the smaller streams are much cut up by the ravines.\n\n* By census report; by settlement returns the area is 2,214.\nwhich form the natural drainage of the contiguous country; and in the eastern parganas specially there are numerous patches of land covered with that white mineral efflorescence called \"reh,\" a combination of sulphate of soda and other salts, which is deadly to vegetation, but which recent experiments have demonstrated can be decomposed and got rid of by an improved system of tillage.\n\nInundations.\u2014The eastern parganas are flooded more or less entirely every year (vide descriptions of Tambaur, Kundri north and Kundri south); the inundations often ruining entire villages and always causing loss to the inhabitants by the destruction of their houses and cattle. At the present time (September, 1871) all that part of the country is under water, and for the past six weeks it has been with the greatest difficulty that the zamindars have been got to come into Sitapur, or that the process-servers have been able to execute the orders of the courts. And it is said the greater part of the autumn harvest has failed.\n\nSubdivisions.\u2014The collection of the demand is entrusted to the collector of the district, who is assisted in the duty by four native sub-collectors or tahsildars, having their headquarters at the four tahsils into which the district is divided. These tahsils with their component parganas are as follows:\n\n| Tahsil | Parganas |\n|--------|----------|\n| I.\u2014Sitapur | Sitapur, Khairabad, Pirnagar, R\u0101mkot, Harg\u0101m, L\u0101harpur. |\n| II.\u2014B\u0101ri | B\u0101ri, Manw\u0101n, Mahmudabad, Sadpur, Kundri south. |\n| III.\u2014M\u012br\u012bkh | M\u012br\u012bkh, Aurangabad, Gundamau, Machhrehta, Chandra, Maholi, Kurauna. |\n| IV.\u2014Bisw\u0101n | Bisw\u0101n, Tambaur, Kundri north. |\n\nRivers, water communication, 300 miles.\u2014Sitapur is well provided with rivers and streams\u2014from the Gogra in the east to the Gumti in the west. The former is a very large river indeed, fordable nowhere during any part of the year, and in the rains having a width of from four to six miles.\n\nThe Chauka.\u2014Eight miles to the west is the Chauka, the second largest river in the district, and running into the Gogra at Bahramghat in the Bara Banki district. This ghat is connected with Lu\u0107know by a railway, and thus a ready outlet to the west is provided for the grain from the east of Sitapur which borders on the Gogra.\nSmaller streams.\u2014Between these two rivers the country is cut up by numerous smaller streams, which are all fordable in the dry weather, and the chief of which are the Bah\u00e1\u00ed, the Gubraiya, the Yaha, the Ghagghar, and the Sukni; this part of the district is known as the Gogra Chauka Du\u00e1b, and is subject to frequent and heavy floods as mentioned above.\n\nUl, Kew\u00e1ni, Sumli.\u2014West again of the Chauka is the Ul flowing into the Kew\u00e1ni, and the Sumli, all three fordable during the dry season, but navigable for country boats during the rest of the year.\n\nOld bed of the Chauka.\u2014We then meet with a narrow strip of moist land overlooked by a ridge of earth of from 20 to 40 feet in height, and running down from Kheri through Sitapur to the Bara Banki district; this strip of land was apparently once the bed of the Chauka (now 9 miles to the east), and the ridge of earth its right bank. The river is said to have changed its course about 150 years ago.\n\nGon.\u2014Twelve miles further west we meet with the Gon, an inconsiderable stream, and not used as means of communication.\n\nSar\u00e1yan.\u2014It flows into the Sar\u00e1yan at P\u00edrnagar 14 miles south of Sitapur through which town that river passes; and the united stream goes on in a south-easterly direction until it meets the Gumti at Hindaura Gh\u00e1t. West of the Sar\u00e1yan, and flowing into it, is a small stream, the Retha, and still further west is the Retia, also a small stream, joining the Gumti at D\u00fadhanmau.\n\nGumti.\u2014Last of all comes the Gumti, a good sized navigable river, and at the same time fordable here and there in the dry season. It flows down through Lucknow, Sult\u00e1npur, and Jaunpur until it meets the Ganges at Benares.\n\nOf the above rivers the Chauka, the Gogra, and the Gumti, described at length under their proper headings, are navigable for boats of from five to twelve hundred maunds; the Kew\u00e1ni, and the Sar\u00e1yan are navigable by boats of one hundred maunds. Their beds are all sandy. There are no towns upon their banks, nor is there any trading population. Formerly only the feudal lords resided near the rivers in order to command the passage by their cannon, and compel trading vessels to pay for permission to proceed. The Gogra is fordable nowhere; all the others are fordable in innumerable places; the Chauka about five years ago changed its course, and the main stream now joins the Kauri\u00e1la or Gogra at Mall\u00e1pur. The traffic on them is detailed under that heading.\n\nDetails of the area of the district as shown by the khasra survey.\u2014The khasra survey of the district was commenced in the cold weather (1863-64,) and was completed in 1866-67. This survey was superintended by the settlement officer, and is not to be confounded with the survey conducted by the revenue surveyor which preceded it. The former goes much more carefully into details than the latter, but both correspond pretty exactly in their results for the whole district.\nThe khara survey then shows as follows for the years in which it was accomplished:\n\n| Cultivated area | Acres |\n|-----------------|-------|\n| Culturable      |       |\n| Revenue-free    |       |\n| Barren          |       |\n\nTotal, 1,440,209\n\nGroves, jhils, jungles.\u2014The detail of the jhils, groves, and jungles is given thus:\n\n| Groves         | Acres |\n|----------------|-------|\n| Jungle         |       |\n| Jhils          |       |\n\nThe above figures are given by the settlement officer. But the following table is an abstract of the statistics given in the final settlement report, and they differ materially from the preceding. It omits the grants of waste lands, for the reason that they pay no land revenue; in other respects the table is generally correct.\n\nGeneral statement explanatory of the revised assessment.\n\n| Bari | Miarikh | Silapet | Biswais | Grand total |\n|------|---------|---------|---------|-------------|\n| No.  | No.     | No.     | No.     | No.         |\n| Number of mubils | 548 | 667 | 480 | 560 | 2,355 |\n| acres | acres | acres | acres | acres |\n| Total area of mubils | 318,469 | 376,185 | 333,673 | 367,127 | 1,417,554 |\n| Barren | 48,415 | 27,749 | 44,600 | 44,948 | 175,702 |\n| Groves less than 10 per cent | 6,784 | 6,923 | 11,867 | 10,531 | 35,085 |\n| Total non-assessable | 55,796 | 45,516 | 92,867 | 58,692 | 242,865 |\n| Irrigated by wells | 10,504 | 8,715 | 15,967 | 7,108 | 43,394 |\n| Ditto by ponds | 38,410 | 12,649 | 28,467 | 8,209 | 89,755 |\n| Unirrigated | 159,349 | 222,906 | 172,970 | 283,781 | 758,006 |\n| Total cultivation | 208,853 | 257,292 | 210,466 | 269,948 | 946,561 |\n| Total assessable | 262,678 | 332,767 | 290,876 | 311,445 | 1,297,766 |\n| Resident cultivators | 16,639 | 24,982 | 24,884 | 58,955 | 104,460 |\n| Non-resident cultivators | 11,918 | 9,581 | 14,693 | 36,238 | 62,430 |\n| Total number of cultivators | 37,557 | 34,563 | 39,577 | 49,293 | 151,080 |\n| Number of ploughs | 26,639 | 27,097 | 27,079 | 27,321 | 108,036 |\n| Ditto cattle | 185,570 | 177,510 | 176,964 | 217,556 | 753,500 |\n| acres | acres | acres | acres | acres |\n| Sir | 18,997 | 17,918 | 21,684 | 17,724 | 75,223 |\n| Other cultivation of proprietors | 2,257 | 14,677 | 6,458 | 1,643 | 25,539 |\n| Of resident cultivators | 147,060 | 158,975 | 115,463 | 184,920 | 565,428 |\n| Of non-resident cultivators | 40,623 | 67,946 | 49,809 | 102,434 |\n| Rs. a. p. | Rs. a. p. | Rs. a. p. | Rs. a. p. | Rs. a. p. |\n| Rent-rate on cultivation | 1 10 7 | 1 6 4 | 1 7 7 | 1 4 8 | 1 7 3 |\n| Ditto culturable | 1 5 1 | 0 15 11 | 1 1 10 | 1 0 4 | 1 1 0 |\n| Total | 1 1 4 | 0 14 0 | 0 14 6 | 0 14 10 | 0 14 40 |\nThere are a number of lakes in Sitapur, but most of them are merely large ponds with stretches of marshy land all round. There are four in pargana B\u00e1ri,\u2014one borders on the villages Bahirwa, Chh\u00e1jan, Jal\u00e1lpur, Andhna, a second on Haraiya, R\u00e1md\u00e1na, Bhandia, Ajai, and a third on Chauriya, Chandiy\u00e1, Uncha Khera, Semra, Kaima, R\u00e1mpur, and others, a fourth on Surjanpur, Shankarpur, Sair. In Mahmudabad there is a fifth small lake bordering the villages Kaur\u00e1r, Mad\u00e1pur, Bh\u00e1npur, Lodhaura, and others. In Tambaur pargana there are two jhilis at Harharpur and Rudr\u00e1pur. In Kundri at Ajaipur and Rajpur. All of them are navigable by small boats of shallow draught, but they are only useful for irrigation.\n\nVegetable products.\u2014To come to the vegetable products they may be divided into A cultivated produce, B uncultivated produce.\n\nTaking the latter first we have that derived from trees under the form of timber, fruit, fibres, dyes, gum, and lac, and the trees yielding these are as follows:\n\n| Mango (Mangifera indica). | Kathal (Artocarpus integrifolia). |\n|---------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Pipal (Ficus religiosa).   | Babul (Acacia Arabica).          |\n| G\u00falar (Ficus glomerata).   | Khair (Acacia catechu).          |\n| P\u00e1kar (Ficus venosa).      | Dh\u00e1k (Butea frondosa).           |\n| Bargad or Banyan tree (Ficus indica) | Khajur (Phoenix sylvestris). |\n| Nim (Azadirachta indica).  | Koala (Phyllanthus emblica).     |\n| Sissoo (Delbergia Sissu).   | Stras (Morusa serissa).          |\n| Tun (Cedrela toona).       | Tamarind (Tamarindus indica).    |\n| Phalenda (Syzygium jambolanum). | Kachn\u00e1r (Bauhinia variegata). |\n| J\u00e1mun (Eugenia jambolana). | Common Bamboo (Bambusa).        |\n| Bel (Egla marmorea).       | Semal (Bombax heptaphylla).      |\n\nOf these the only tree grown in groves is the mango, and it, and many of the others notably the pipal and bel are considered by the Hindus to be sacred trees, and no devout member of that body will destroy them with the axe or by fire or in any other way. The bel, for instance, is a representative of Shiva, and the pipal and banyan represent Vishnu; the person who plants one of the latter does so expecting that just as he has set apart a tree to afford shade to his fellow-creatures in this world so after death he will not be scorched by excessive heat in his journey to the kingdom of Yama, the regent of death.\n\nThese two with the g\u00falar and p\u00e1kar are of the fig genus; the fruit of the g\u00falar being of a better and larger description than that of the p\u00e1kar. Lac is yielded by the pipal. The leaves of the nim possess medicinal properties, as does also the fruit of the bel tree.\n\nThe semal is the \u201ccotton tree\u201d growing to an immense size and bright with crimson flowers; the phalenda is a larger species of the j\u00e1mun, both having a purple fruit as large as a damson; and the kathal is the well known \u201cjack fruit tree.\u201d The babul, khair, and dh\u00e1k are smaller trees than any of the others, and grow in the most barren soil; the first yields both a dye and a gum, the ordinary \u201cgum arabic,\u201d the last the gum known as \u201cdragon\u2019s blood or kine,\u201d and the khair produces the \u201ccatechu\u201d familiar to doctors. All three are combined to form the khaki colour used in dyeing the uniforms of many of the native regiments and of the well known Oudh constabulary. A red dye is obtained from the scarlet flowers of the dh\u00e1k,\nand is used at the Holi and at weddings for smearing the clothes of those who take part in those joyous festivals. A red dye is also obtained from a gum which the pipal yields, and from it the country red ink is made.\n\nThe khajur is the common date palm, and is useful in this part of India rather for its leaves than for its fruit, the former making good matting; its fruit is very small, and it yields a juice or tari just like that of the properly so called tari tree.\n\nThe kachnar in the month of February is exceedingly pretty being one mass of lilac-coloured flowers; and these are not only pretty to the eye, but when cooked form a delicate vegetable for the table. The fruit of the aonla is about the size of a small orange. The siras, of the genus acacia, is a small but graceful tree, with pretty leaves, and covered in the season with yellow flowers. The tamarind and bamboo are two well known to require any description here. The dhak mentioned above is known in other parts of India as the palis or paris, and from this word the village of Plassey, the scene of Clive's famous victory, takes its name.\n\nThese are the trees of Sitapur. There are no forests to be met with as has already been stated: nor do we find the mahua tree which is so common in the other parts of Oudh. This is very much to be regretted, as the profits arising from it are very considerable, and in bad seasons the zamindars and grove-holders would have something to fall back upon. In one district (Partabgarh), the area of which is only two-thirds that of Sitapur, the settlement officer has estimated the yearly value of the mahua crop at one lakh and a half of rupees, the flower being used in the distillation of spirit, the fruit as food for man, and when plentiful for beast; and the seed for oil.\n\nUncultivated products.\u2014The other uncultivated vegetable products of this district are the fibres obtained from the roots of the dhak, from the munj and sarpat grass, and from the date palm already mentioned. From the munj and sarpat a string is twisted which is woven into matting, and a coarse rope is made from the other two which is used for tying up cattle and such like purposes. Mud wells are often lined with a sort of cable made from the rusa, a wild shrub, growing to the height of four or five feet.\n\nWild animals.\u2014The wild animals resemble those of Upper India generally, and are the nil-gae, the black buck, pahra, gond, and other kinds of deer, the wild pig, fox, jackal, wolf, and hare. We meet with none of the larger carnivora, nor are wild elephants, rhinoceroses, or wild buffaloes found anywhere within the district. There are a few wolves; no rewards are paid for killing snakes.\n\nIn the river itself there are the different varieties of the Indian crocodile and river porpoise, and of course fish of many descriptions, but the hills, the Cekti, and the mahsir are not among them.\n\n\"The following sporting particulars are given by Major Tweedie:\u2014\n\nAs a rule, on the plains in India game of all descriptions will generally be found most abundantly in the neighbourhood of large rivers. The\nreason of this is apparent. The inundations caused by the overflow of rivers during the rains cause tracts of land to be covered with grass, where a great deal of sand is deposited by the floods a very coarse description of grass springs up, and on low lying lands where inundated by rivers whose source is in the plains, the grass is generally the kind used for thatching purposes by the natives. In the Sitapur district, therefore, nil-gae, pig, parha, and antelope will be found in the greatest numbers in the waste lands lying along the banks of the rivers Gumti, Chauka, and Gogra. A few swamp deer are also to be found in the eastern parts of the district. The antelope being the most numerous of all the fauna in this district, is deserving of mention first. The black buck, the male of an antelope, is so well known in India that any lengthy description of him would be out of place here. Antelope are found more or less all over the district, but in greatest numbers on high and low ground running along the banks of the river Gumti, where they may be seen in herds of some 20 and 30 does to one black buck. The young bucks are not allowed to remain in the company of the does, and generally herd together in small parties. Directly the black buck of a herd is shot, another takes his place. Should an outsider approach a herd before the master buck has been shot a fight instantly takes place, and at this time they can be easily approached and shot. At other times the does keep a watchful look out, one in a herd always remaining standing, and on the first approach of danger a grunt or two is given and all begin to stand up; at this time the only way to kill the buck is to circle him; if the circling is properly performed the buck will be under the delusion that you are walking away from him. This plan is however only followed by European sportsmen, the exertion being usually too great for natives. A shot can then be generally got at about 120 or 150 yards, and the shot should always be delivered standing. Natives shoot and kill them in a variety of ways, the most common being that of shooting with a trained bullock. The bullock is driven with a rope passed through his nostrils, and the shikari walks alongside of the bullock. When near enough, say some 50 yards, the bullock is checked and the shikari shoots either behind or underneath the stomach of the bullock; another very common way is for the shikari to dig a pit in the middle of the grass plains inhabited by the antelope, just deep enough to conceal the shikari sitting down, the top of the pit is left quite flush with the ground. This is a very tedious way of shooting them, and can only be followed by natives who wait patiently for hours before getting a shot; when however they do get one they are certain to kill as they shoot at very short distances, and rest their gun on the edge of the pit. A class of men called Bahelia come frequently from the neighbourhood of Gwalior, and are very skilful in catching antelope by the legs with nooses. Pegs are driven into the ground in a line often some 200 yards long and at distances of two or three feet apart. To these pegs are attached nooses, and these are fastened to the grass so as to raise them a few inches of the ground, as soon as a herd of deer is seen in the vicinity of the place; the shikaris gently drive them towards the line of nooses. Two or three of the deer generally manage to get their legs into the nooses, and the shikaris running up despatch them with their clubs and knives. Antelope are very destructive to young crops, and as they feed by night their depredations are very\ngreat. Where numerous the cultivators are obliged to watch the fields by night.\n\n\"After the antelope the nil-gae (Tortax picta) come next as regards numbers in this district. No Hindu will kill the nil-gae, as they consider them allied to the domestic cow. Such however is not the case, for they belong to the same family as the antelope, and are so classed by naturalists. They are very destructive animals and require shooting carefully, or will invariably get away to die of their wounds. The male is a very handsome creature, and if he has come to mature age is of a dark blue colour. This is the blue bull of the Indian sportsman. The Muhammadans are very fond of eating his flesh, but it is usually considered coarse and inferior to the flesh of the antelope by Europeans. They are to be found in numbers on the waste land, situated in the eastern part of the district. They are, however, scattered in small numbers all over it, and wherever there is a piece of tree jungle nil-gae are sure to be found. The female is of a light dun colour, and like the female of the antelope has nothing very striking about it in appearance. Europeans usually consider shooting the nil-gae but very poor sport, for there is not the same excitement about it as there is in antelope shooting. The nicety and delicacy of hand required in antelope shooting is probably one of its chief charms to the English sportsman. The nil-gae is, however, a very destructive animal as he can eat as much as an English ox, and their numbers should always be kept down if possible.\n\n\"The wild pig (Sus Indicus) is dying out rapidly in this district. They are still to be found on the low grass lands in the eastern portion of the district, and a few in the tree jungles in the western portion. The part of the district inhabited by these animals is however not suitable for the sport of riding them down and killing them with a spear. The wild pig is a very fine looking creature, feeds cleanly, and is of a very different habit from his domestic native relation. The P\u00e1s\u00eds are the greatest hunters of the wild pig in this district, and it is to their exertions, together with the spread of cultivation, that this animal will in a few years only be known by name.\n\n\"The p\u00e1rha, known also as the hog-deer, is found in the eastern portion of the district, and inhabits the same kind of ground as the wild pig. Like the pig they are becoming very scarce, and in a few years hence will cease to exist. There is one other animal still existing in this district which requires notice. The swamp deer of Bengal (Cervus wallichii) known also as the gon, barah singha, and maha. They are to be found in small numbers in the tall grass jungles on the banks of the Chauka and Gogra. The stag is a very handsome creature with fine branching horns and not unlike the red deer of Scotland. This year (1874) I have shot two stags, but took good care not to shoot the hinds; and as long as the grass jungle remains we shall still have the pleasure of seeing this noble creature. They are very harmless and shy, but rarely leave the grass jungle and feed entirely on grass. Their flesh is quite unfit for consumption, and the only inducement to shoot them is for the sportsman to hang up the heads and horns as a trophy to delight his eyes when the time comes when he will be unable to sight and draw the trigger of his rifle.\"\n\"The tiger was very plentiful in this district some 20 or 25 years back. At that time a much larger body of water used to come down the river Chauka, and the floods were consequently much more extensive than they are now; of late years the river Gogra has carried off the most of the water which used to flow into the Chauka, and the grass and jh\u0101u jungle is gradually disappearing before the spread of cultivation. The king of Oudh and his nobles used to pursue the sport of tiger shooting in the eastern portion of this district, and there are also native gentlemen now alive who have killed many tigers there. The last tiger killed here fell to the gun of Colonel E. Thompson, C.S.I., and was shot near Budhbar some few years ago.\n\n\"The leopard (Felis leopardus) is occasionally killed in this district. A few still find their way down through the tree jungle on the banks of the river Kathna. They are very scarce, however, and as the tree jungle is gradually disappearing in this district, so will the leopard like the tiger and wild pig become eventually to be known only by name.\"\n\nDomestic animals.\u2014The domestic animals of the district require no particular mention; they are the ordinary oxen, buffaloes, ponies, asses, goats, pigs, sheep, and dogs, met with all over India. In addition to these the wealthier inhabitants possess elephants, camels, and imported horses.\n\nGame birds.\u2014Feathered game of all kinds is to be found in fair quantity in this district. It comprises\u2014\n\n| Game Bird                  | Scientific Name                      |\n|---------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Peacock                   | *Pavo Cristatus*                    |\n| Black partridge           | *Francolinus vulgaris*              |\n| Grey partridge            | *Ortygornis Pondicerianus*          |\n| Common grey quail         | *Coturnix Communis*                 |\n| Rain quail                | *Coturnix Coromandelicus*           |\n| Florican                  | *Syphoetides bengalensis*           |\n| Leek Florican             | *Syphoetides auritus*               |\n| Kulans                    | *Grus cinerea*                      |\n| Snipe                     | *Sclopax gallinago*                 |\n| Painted snipe             | *Rhyncuedula troeana*               |\n| Teal                      | *Querguedula circa*                 |\n| Gargenning Teal           | *Branta rufina*                     |\n| Pochard                   | *Athya nyroca*                      |\n| White-eyed duck           | *Anas Boschas*                      |\n| Mallard                   | *Dafila senta*                      |\n| Pintail duck              | *Casarca rufia*                     |\n| Ruddy sheldrake           | *Cyettapaa coromandeliana*          |\n| Cotton teal               | *Dendrocygna awasee*                |\n| Whistling duck            | *Spatula clypatea*                  |\n| Shoveller duck            | *Anser cineceus*                    |\n| Wild goose                | *Sarkidiorus melanotus*             |\n| Comb goose                |                                     |\n\nThe peacock is to be found in considerable numbers in the western portion of this district. They are however not so numerous as they were a few years back, owing to the soldiers from the Cantonment at Sitapur being extremely fond of shooting them. It will be long however before they become extinct as the Hindus do all they can to prevent their destruction. No prettier sight can be seen than peacock strutting about in the early morning in the spring time. Then is the time of their courting, and the male displays his tail to the admiring eyes of his future wives.\nThe black partridge is still to be found along the banks of the large rivers in this district, as also in the tree and grass jungle in the western portions. They are much sought after by European sportsmen, and their flesh is deservedly esteemed. The grey partridge is scattered all over the district, but in small numbers and chiefly delights in the comparatively open country. They are not in much request by European sportsmen, but natives are fond of keeping them in cages. The common grey quail is numerous all over the district in the winter and spring months. They are much sought after by Europeans as well as natives, and the latter keep them in cages in large numbers for fighting purposes. The quail is a bird of passage, and leaves the country as soon as the hot weather begins. The rain quail and button quail breed in the district, but are not to be compared to the grey quail for culinary purposes. The jhils and tanks contain numerous kinds of ducks. Large numbers are snared by the fowlers for sale, and are readily bought both by Europeans and natives. All the jhils in which there is grass cover contain snipe, as many as 60 and 100 couple have frequently been shot in a day. Their numbers never decrease, and each succeeding year sees the jhils well stocked with this delicate bird. The snipe does not breed in this country, but retires to colder latitudes on the approach of the hot weather. The whistling teal or tree duck breeds in this district in large numbers during the rains. Their nests are invariably placed in trees, and as soon as the young are hatched the old birds carry them down on their backs to the nearest piece of water. The cotton teal also breeds in the district during the rains. The kulan, a species of crane, is very abundant just after the rains; they feed entirely in the rice fields, and at night collect in large numbers on the sand banks in the rivers Chauka and Gogra. There are two species of the kulan, one is larger than the other, and has a very pretty tuft descending from the back of his head. They are good eating, and much appreciated by the natives. Sportsmen should refrain from shooting partridges or peafowl after the first of March, as they then begin to pair and make preparations for incubation.\n\nIn making mention of the fauna in this district, I have omitted to mention the hare (Lepus vulgaris). They are to be found everywhere, and are about one-half the size of their English brethren.\n\nMineral products.\u2014There are neither mines nor quarries, properly so called, in the district. Kankar is dug up all over the country, and is used for local purposes, the lime burnt from it in the town of Mahrajnagar having a certain local repute.\n\nWe do not meet here with any salt-producing lands such as exist in southern Oudh, the proceeds from which formed such a large source of profit to the zamindar and the State under the native rule.\n\nTemperature.\u2014The average temperature ranges from 45\u00b0 in the cold season to 96\u00b0 in the hot weather, but it is often so cold at night that hoar-frost is seen in the morning and the manufacture of ice in shallow earthenware vessels is carried on with success in December and January.\n\nWinds.\u2014The prevailing winds are from the east during the rains, and from the west during the remainder of the year.\nClimate.\u2014The climate is considered very salubrious for Europeans, and the cantonments of Sitapur are famous for the small mortality of the British stationed there. There are no diseases peculiar to the district.\n\nSeasons.\u2014The year may be divided into four seasons as follows:\n\n- From 1st February to 1st April, pleasantly warm.\n- 1st April to 15th June, very hot.\n- 15th June to 1st October, rains.\n- 25th October to 31st January, cold weather.\n\nRainfall.\u2014The average yearly rainfall for the past five years ending 1871 was $32\\frac{1}{2}$ inches, the provincial average being 38. This is one of the driest districts of Oudh, the average for the last ten years being thirty-five inches; 1867 and 1870 were years of excessive rain; 1864, 1866, 1868, and 1873, years of partial drought. This subject will be referred to afterwards under that of famines. Here it may be remarked that as elsewhere the rainfall is most uneven varying almost 300 per cent. in one year, falling from 60 inches in 1867 to 21 inches in 1868. Except in so far that the water level in the wells may probably be slightly raised by the heavy rainfalls of preceding years, there is no store of water from previous abundant seasons to counteract the effects of a drought. No canals of any kind have been made in this district, and it seems one in which some more enlarged means of storing water will shortly be required. Masonry wells are not used for purposes of irrigation except in rare instances for garden lands.\n\n| Years | Inches | Remarks |\n|-------|--------|---------|\n| 1864  | 36\u00b70   |         |\n| 1865  | 31\u00b70   |         |\n| 1866  | 25\u00b70   |         |\n| 1867  | 60\u00b75   |         |\n| 1868  | 21\u00b73   |         |\n| 1869  | 27\u00b76   |         |\n| 1870  | 55\u00b79   |         |\n| 1871  | 49\u00b72   |         |\n| 1872  | 32\u00b79   |         |\n| 1873  | 25\u00b70   |         |\n| 1874  | 48\u00b78   | 8       |\n| 1875  | 32\u00b73   | 3       |\n\nAverage for twelve years. 35\u00b74\n\nThe following table exhibits the rainfalls for the last two years of drought, 1868 and 1873, each of which was followed in 1869 and 1874 respectively by a considerable scarcity.\n\nIt will be noted that the entire rainfall was not scanty, but the distribution was capricious and unusual, and there was no rain during individual months in which it is much needed for agricultural purposes. There are four rainfalls each of which must be propitious to secure a good harvest.\nFirst the June rains, the former rains as they may be called; in 1873 they were quite wanting; there was no rain to moisten the earth for the plough and to water the early rice.\n\nSecond, the main monsoon which commences in July and ends at the commencement of October; this was sufficient in both years; but the fall in September, 1873, was only 3\u00b77 inches, and it ceased too soon, viz., on September 15th.\n\nThirdly, the latter or October rains, which are required to water the late rice and moisten the land for the winter ploughings, were wholly deficient in both years.\n\nFourth, the January-February rains, which were wholly wanting in 1869 and in 1874, amounted to an inch and a half.\n\nSpeaking broadly then the rains commenced fairly in 1868, badly in 1873; they ended with nearly five inches in 1868, but too soon in 1873; they were scanty for the last month, and ended still earlier in September.\n\nSo far 1873 was much worse than 1868; then there was absolutely no rain in the either year from October till January, but in January-February there was no rain in 1869, and a good fall in 1874.\n\n|                  | 1868. | 1873. |\n|------------------|-------|-------|\n| **TOTAL RAINFALL** |       |       |\n| Rainfall from 1st June to October 1st | ...   | 25\u00b76  |\n| From October 1st to December 31st    | ...   | 0\u00b70   |\n| In June                            | ...   | 2\u00b79   |\n| In September                       | ...   | 4\u00b78   |\n| In October                         | ...   | 0\u00b70   |\n| Date of rain commencing            | June 5th | July 6th. |\n| If rain ending                     | September 23rd | September 17th. |\n| Rain in January-February of ensuing year | 0\u00b70   | 1\u00b760  |\n\n*Medical aspects.\u2014The climate of the station and greater part of the district of Sitapur is considered healthy and I believe justly so. The soil is light and sandy, and fairly cultivated. There is little jungle now remaining in the district and what does exist, distributed in patches of no great extent, is neither high nor dense. Jhils are neither very numerous nor very large, and except in the north western part of the district there is not much low lying or marshy land.\n\nTemperature.\u2014The range of the thermometer in the shade throughout the year is from a minimum of 40\u00b0 in December and January to a maximum of 112\u00b0 in May and June. The mean daily range is however only about 13\u00b0.\n\nThese figures are taken from records kept in hospital. The temperature is taken by a common thermometer, the minimum at sunrise; if taken\n\n* By the Civil Surgeon.\nby a self-registering thermometer the minimum a little before sunrise would be less and the daily range greater, but the figures given above show a close approximation to the range, and we may fairly infer from them that the daily range, is not great, and this fact is more important as far as health is concerned than the actual temperature.\n\nThe cold weather is good and bracing, better than that of most districts in the province,\n\nVital statistics.\u2014From examination of the mortuary returns for the last three years it would appear that 77 out of every 100 deaths in the district are due to fevers.\n\nThe returns for 1872 put down 63 per cent. of total deaths to fever.\n\n| Year | Deaths |\n|------|--------|\n| 1873 | 83 per cent. |\n| 1874 | 87 \" |\n\nThe fever is supposed to be of the intermittent kind and of malarious origin; but these returns are obviously incorrect. The death rate calculated from them and the census of 1869 is for 1873 a little under 12 per 1,000 of the population, and for 1874 under 11 per 1,000, giving an average life of about 87 years. In dealing with returns which gives such results great care is necessary.\n\nFever.\u2014The prominent symptoms of fever are common to other diseases, and I have no doubt that in many cases these symptoms were mistaken for the disease, and deaths put down to fever which were caused by other diseases.\n\nFrom August to November intermittent fever is prevalent, but the type of fever prevailing in the greater part of the district is not a bad one; the cases met with at the dispensaries yield readily to treatment and are seldom fatal. From my experience of the district, I would not expect the mortality from fever to be great. The conditions most favourable to malaria are not present in the greater part of the district, at least to any great extent. I except from this statement the north-west part of the district, the parganas of Tambaur and Kundri in the Biswan tahsil and Kundri pargana in the Bari tahsil, that part of the district between the Gogra and Chauka, and a strip of land on the eastern side of the latter river; these parts are low lying and marshy. The staple crop is rice, and the ground during the rains is more or less under water. Here the conditions favourable to malaria are present in abundance, and intermittent fever of a bad type is present during the latter months of the year. The mortuary returns would indicate that fever is nearly equally prevalent in other parts of the district. In this and other respects I believe the returns are incorrect.\n\nSmall-pox.\u2014The returns put down 12 per cent. of the mortality to small-pox. This disease is much more easily dangerous than fever, and I am inclined to think the returns not far from the mark on this point. The disease is prevalent from March to September, and vaccination has made little progress in the district.\nCholera.\u2014Some deaths from cholera are reported every year, but the disease seldom appears in the district as an epidemic, and the mortality from it is comparatively trifling. In 1869 it prevailed during April and May in an epidemic form. It commenced at the Nimkh\u00e1r fair on the Gumti in the beginning of April, and spread to different parts of the district on the return of the pilgrims to their homes. I cannot obtain any mortuary returns for 1869, but I know that the mortality from cholera that year was considerable. As a rule, however, the district is very free from epidemic cholera. The ratio of total deaths to deaths from cholera for the last three years is as 1 to 0.018. I do not know of any disease especially peculiar to the district.\nCHAPTER II.\n\nAGRICULTURE AND COMMERCE.\n\nTowns\u2014Principal staples\u2014Agricultural operations\u2014Kharif and rabi crops\u2014Sugarcane\u2014Cotton\u2014Poppy\u2014Indigo.

The former is believed by the inhabitants to be the city of king Bair\u00e1t where the P\u00e1ndavas spent the thirteenth year of their exile; and the latter, formerly known as M\u00e1npur, is said to be the Mainpur of the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1r\u00e1t, in the neighbourhood of which Arjun, the third P\u00e1ndava, was slain by his son Babar B\u00e1han. One mile from the town is the village of Ranu\u00e1para, \u201cor the place of the battles,\u201d and here it was that the son killed the father. L\u00e1harpur is famous as being the birth-place of the celebrated R\u00e1ja Todar Mal.\n\nPrincipal staples.\u2014The principal staples of Sitapur resemble those of the greater part of Upper India, and are as follows:\n\n| Crop          | Acres   | Average price during last five years |\n|---------------|---------|--------------------------------------|\n| Wheat         | 165,003 | 18 sars 15 ch. per. Re.              |\n| Barley        | 95,008  | 81 \u201d 18 \u201d                            |\n| J\u00faar          | 70,000  | 20 \u201d 10 \u201d                            |\n| Gram          | 95,000  | 25 \u201d 1 \u201d                             |\n| Sugarcane     | 15,000  |                                      |\n| Bajra         | 52,000  |                                      |\n| Oil seeds     | 30,000  |                                      |\n| Rice          | 81,000  |                                      |\n\nTotal: 403,006\nIn addition to these there are of course the \"Kachhi\u00e1na,\" or vegetables and other similar crops cultivated by the K\u00e1chhis and Mur\u00e1os who are found in most villages.\n\n**Tobacco.**\u2014The tobacco grown and manufactured at Bisw\u00e1n is much sought after, and is exported to other districts.\n\n**Poppy.**\u2014The poppy is cultivated under arrangements with the local Opium Agent, whose headquarters are in Sitapur.\n\n**Cotton.**\u2014Cotton is grown, but to an inconsiderable extent, and only to supply local needs.\n\n**Indigo and silk.**\u2014There are no indigo factories or silk filature in the district, and the mulberry tree is unknown, and almost the same may be said of flax, which is grown very sparingly. The following extracts are mostly taken from the Settlement Report.\n\n**Agricultural operations and crops.**\u2014In addition to what has been already stated, it may be observed that in Sitapur the main crops are wheat, barley, gram, kodo, ju\u00e1r, urd, and tobacco. This last crop is its specialty, that of Bisw\u00e1n especially is celebrated; 18,000 acres are devoted to this cultivation, above a quarter of the whole area in Oudh, 69,000 acres, so applied. The best Bisw\u00e1n tobacco sells at three and a half seers for the rupee, ordinary tobacco at eight seers for the rupee.\n\nBut the price has fallen slightly this year; at the town itself it is sold for from Rs. 3 to Rs. 7 per maund after being kept and dried for a year. The price has fallen from recent rates which were from Rs. 8 to Rs. 11 per maund, but is still higher than the prices current in the Naw\u00e1bi, Rs. 3 to Rs. 6 per maund. The reason of this is that the sale has expanded with the opening of roads and Bisw\u00e1n tobacco which formerly all went to Lucknow, now is transported to Bareilly and R\u00e1mpur. Halw\u00e1sis on the spot prepare the tobacco with sugar and spices brought from Lucknow, the fragrance of Bisw\u00e1n tobacco is ascribed to the water. Akbarpur in pargana Mahmudabad is most celebrated for its produce. There is no secret in the preparation. The crop is watered about five times. A good crop is reckoned three maunds to the local bigh\u00e1, but half that is above the average. The maund used in the tobacco trade is 56 seers or exactly one hundred weight; it is supposed to be three local maunds; a very good crop then will be 20 maunds or rather 1,620lbs. per acre, and 810lbs. about an average; its value will be about Rs. 52, at Rs. 7 per hundred weight; rent will be Rs. 18, cost of irrigation with a dhenkli watering four biswas Rs. 18, manure Rs. 3, ploughing Rs. 6, dressing Rs. 3,\u2014total, Rs. 48 per acre.\n\n**Crops.**\u2014The cultivated produce consists of the following staples:\n\nI. **The Khar\u00edf or autumn crops.**\n\n- **Rice (Oryza Sativa).**\n- **Kodo (Paspalum Sero biulatum).**\n- **S\u00e1nw\u00e1n (Panicum frumentaceum).**\n- **Mindwa (Eleusine coracana).**\n- **K\u00e1kun (Panicum italicum).**\n- **Ju\u00e1r large and small (Tea Mays and Sorghum Vulgare).**\n- **B\u00e1jra (Penicillaria spicata).**\n- **Til (Sesamum indicum).**\n- **Urd or M\u00e1sh (Phaseolus radiatus).**\n- **M\u00fang (Phaseolus Mungo).**\n- **Moth (Phaseolus aconitifolius).**\nPatwa (Hibiscus sabdariffa) sanai or san (Crotalaria juncea). These are well known and call for no detailed notice here; suffice it to say that there are very many varieties of rice, and this crop is the staple of the eastern portion of the district. The name paddy, by which it is very generally known among Europeans, appears to be like many other Anglo-Indian words of Dutch origin. No Munshi has ever been able to tell me anything about it more than that; \"it was an English word;\" while the ordinary European asserts that \"it must be a native word;\" and although Professor Forbes in his dictionary states, I know not on what authority that it is a Hindi word, I hazard the opinion that it is Malay from the fact that in Batava there is one variety of the crop known as \"paddi rawa\" or mountain rice.\n\nTil, like some of the rabi oilseeds, is not grown alone but in the same field with other crops. Urd, mung, and moth are pulses. Patwa is grown along with either arhar (a rabi crop) or ju\u00e1r. It has a yellow flower, and from its fibre, as also from that of san or sanai (the common Indian hemp) string and rope are made\u2014\n\nII. The rabi or spring crops\u2014\n\n| Wheat (Triticum vulgare). | Linseed (Linum usitatissimum). |\n|---------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Gram (Cicer arietinum).   | Castor oil or Rendi (Ricinus communis). |\n| Barley (Hordeum distichon) | Peas (Pisum sativum). |\n| L\u00e1hi (Sinapis).           | Masur (Pisum lens) |\n| Mustard (Sinapis nigra).  | Arhar (Cajanus indicum). |\n| Sarson (Sinapis glauca).  | Safflower (Carthamus tinctorius). |\n\nOf these the first in the list covers the greatest area, and then come barley and gram. L\u00e1hi and linseed (alsi) are occasionally sown by themselves, and not like til and other oilseeds, in conjunction with some other crop. This tinum linseed is the common flax. Castor-oil is produced from a plant which often reaches to the proportions of a tree. It is not as a rule grown in fields, but as a hedge round some other crop. Arhar is planted in July along with ju\u00e1r in the same field, but is not cut until six months later than that crop or in March-April. It bears the d\u00e1l so well known to the eater of pol\u00f3os and khichris. Safflower is planted along with wheat, and produces familiar dyes. Oil is expressed from its seeds which are then given as food to the cattle.\n\nSugarcane.\u2014Besides the above, which are the staple kharif and rabi crops, there is a considerable quantity of sugarcane grown in the district producing one crop in the year, and being of several kinds, as described in the following note by Captain Young, late Settlement Officer.\n\nSpeaking of pargana Maholi, he says,\u2014\u201cThere are four very well marked rent-rates which appear universal in the pargana, and they are regulated entirely by the season at which the cane is sown, or more strictly by the length of time during which the land is occupied by the crop between preparation for sowing and actual development.\n\n\u201cThe local names attaching to the cane are derived from the crops which immediately precede the sowing except in the fourth instance in which this rule does not apply. They are as follows:\u2014\n\n\u201cI.\u2014Chaneri, where sown in a field from which chana has been cut; II.\u2014Maseri, where sown after a crop of m\u2019sh; III.\u2014Dhankari, where it\u2019\nfollows a crop of dh\u00e1n; IV.\u2014Pareli, where there has been no khar\u00edf crop, the land having been under tillage for the cane throughout the rains.\n\n\"The rates I found to be were for No. I. Re. 1-4-0 per kachcha bigha plus 2 annas per rupee kharch or Re. 1-6-6, equal to Rs. 6-12-0 per acre: for No. II. Re. 1-8-0 plus 2 annas per rupee, or Re. 1-11-0 a bigha, equal to Rs. 8-1-7 the acre: for No. III. Re. 1-12-0 plus 2 annas as above, or Re. 1-15-6 a bigha, equal to Rs. 9-9-3 the acre: and for No. IV. Rs. 2-0-0 plus 2 annas as before, or Rs. 2-4-0 per bigha, equal to Rs. 10-12-8 per acre.\n\n\"The rates differ directly as the land is occupied by the cane crop for a longer or shorter period as will be seen from the following statement. For Pareli, the land is wholly clear of the rabi crop by As\u00e1rh (July); it is not sown with khar\u00edf, but is allowed to lie fallow absorbing all the rain and receiving frequent ploughings till the month of M\u00e1gh-Ph\u00e1lgun (January-February) when the cane is sown. The crop thus sown is reaped the following P\u00fas-m\u00e1gh (December-January) having occupied land for one year and seven months.\n\n\"Dhankui. The Dh\u00e1n is the earliest of the khar\u00edf crops, and is cut in Ku\u00e1r (September). This still leaves the husbandman 4 months before cane sowing time to prepare his land. He sows in M\u00e1gh-Ph\u00e1lgun, and cuts in P\u00fas-M\u00e1gh, the crop having occupied the land between preparation and development for one year and four months.\n\n\"Masuri mish is cut in Aghan (November) leaving P\u00fas and M\u00e1gh to prepare the land for a late sowing in Ph\u00e1gun. The crop will then occupy the land for 12 or 13 months.\n\n\"Chaneri chana is the earliest rabi crop, and is cut in Chait (March-April). The plough is then hastily run through the soil again, and cane may even then be sown although nearly two months late. It will in all occupy the land 10 or 11 months.\n\n\"These several calculations have been reckoned only up to the date of the cutting of the crop, but over and above this it must be remembered that as the season for rabi sowing is then past, no further return is got out of the land until the following khar\u00edf.\n\n\"I conclude therefore,\" Captain Young goes on to say, \"that the crop though very profitable to the tenant is not specially so to the landlord even though the rent paid is much higher than ordinary. The real benefit the landlord derives is to be found in the fact that the land after being so thoroughly manured and watered as it is for the cane, yields a very fine rabi without fresh manure at the ensuing spring harvest.\"\n\nIt is remarkable that the cultivation of this crop is under a ban in the eastern parganas of Tambaur and Kundri (north) as is also the use of burnt bricks or tiles.\n\n*Kachhi\u00e1na crops.*\u2014The Kachhi\u00e1na or vegetable garden produce is very various; garlic, haldi, vegetables of all description, spices, ginger, water-\nmelons, are to be seen at almost every village. Haldi gives the well known yellow dye turmeric.\n\nP\u00e1n (Chavica bettepiper) or the leaf used with the betelnut (sup\u00e1ri) as a quid for chewing is met with here and there; the p\u00e1n field presenting the curious appearance of a crop growing on a sloping ridge of earth, and covered over by a trellis work and mats to keep off the rays of the sun. It is a creeper growing somewhat higher than the tallest English pea, and is propagated by cuttings. The plant lasts four or five years.\n\nPrice of staple crops.\u2014The average price during the last five years (1866-1870) of the principal grain crops was as follows:\u2014\n\n| S. ch. | S. ch. |\n|--------|--------|\n| Wheat  | 10     |\n| Barley | 31     |\n| Gram   | 20     |\n| B\u00e9jra  | 25     |\n\nAnd we may here add concluding our notice of this part of our subject that unlike other crops the ears of the bajra and ju\u00e1r are taken off by the hand, and the stalk left standing to be subsequently cut down and chopped up into \"karbi,\" the common fodder of horned cattle.\n\nCultivated fruit trees.\u2014Besides the wild fruit trees already mentioned the district has the following well known cultivated fruits.\n\n| Guavas. | Melons. |\n|---------|---------|\n| Plantains. | Papitas. |\n| Custard apples. | Pummelos. |\n| Oranges and lemons. | Karanda. |\n\nRents.\u2014Rents as a rule are paid in kind, only about one-tenth of the whole being cash payments. The zamindar's share varies from one-fourth to one-half, both extremes being exceptional, and the former to be found only in what was the R\u00e1ja of Chahl\u00e1ri's taluqa in pargana Kundri. The variations are caused by the difference in the allowances made to the tenants. For instance the division is made thus: the tenant is allowed 5 sers out of the maund as k\u00far, and the remaining 35 is divided half and half between him and his landlord; the latter thus getting 17\u00bd sers against the other's 22\u00bd, and the tenant then contributes 2 or 2\u00bd sers towards the patw\u00e1ri's allowance. In other estates, in addition to the 5 sers k\u00far, certain classes of the tenants have a let off which is called \"charwa\" of from 5 to 7\u00bd sers; and thus out of the maund the landlord gets from 12\u00bd to 15 sers, and the tenant 25 to 27\u00bd, subject to the patw\u00e1ri's deduction as before.\n\nVarious proportions of the batti.\u2014These allowances and deductions vary as I have said very much. In some estates the tikur system prevails, that is to say, the tenant keeps two-thirds of outturn, or in other words 26\u00bd sers out of the maund, without any reference to k\u00far or charwa, but subject to the 2 or 2\u00bd sers deductions for village expenses, including the patw\u00e1ri's remuneration. In pargana Gundlamau, again, the system is quite different from the above. The landlord first takes five sers out of the heap of grain for every maund therein. The maund is then divided into two equal portions; and the shares stand thus:\u2014\nLandlord's 25 sers, tenant's 20; finally each contributes 2\u00bd sers for the village expenses, and the result is:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Landlord's share} & : \\quad 24\\frac{1}{2} \\\\\n\\text{Tenant's} & : \\quad 17\\frac{1}{2} \\\\\n\\text{Patwari's} & : \\quad 5 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nFor every maund in the heap.\n\nThe tenant thus gets only \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) or less than one half of each maund which he produces\u2014a proportion which I have not found to be the rule in any other pargana than Gundlamau.\n\nThe custom above noted as prevailing in the Chahl\u00e1ri il\u00e1qa is as follows:\u2014The tenant first takes 7 sers as a k\u00far out of the maund, and the balance is then apportioned one-third to the landlord and two to the tenant, who thus gets 29 sers against the others 11 out of every 40 produced by the land.\n\nThese represent the usual rates for b\u00e1t\u00e1i rents, and the system is in force with respect to all lands, excepting those which produce sugarcane, poppy, tobacco, and vegetables.\n\nThe ryots prefer the b\u00e1t\u00e1i system.\u2014There has been no desire evinced by the people, save in very exceptional instances, to have their payments in kind commuted into cash payments, and perhaps it is too much to expect that any such change should take place immediately. For the Oudh cultivator is wedded to his \"old ideas, and stubbornly stands upon the antiquas vias of his forefathers: what they have been doing for hundreds of years cannot surely be wrong: who is he that he should set himself up against the immemorial custom of his family.\n\nAll this, to be sure, is very much to be regretted. As long as the system of b\u00e1t\u00e1i prevails so long we may expect little advance in the cultivation of the country. Irrigation will not spread: and until forced by the increase in the population which is yearly taking place, the people will do little or nothing towards improving their farming or breaking up new ground.\n\nThe following remarks are the result of enquiries on the spot:\u2014\n\nCondition of the people.\u2014The condition of the people does not greatly vary from its aspect in the adjoining district (Bars Banki); population is not so dense, the landlords are more generally Hindus, and akin to the mass of the people, the properties of the taluqdars are larger, averaging 23,800 acres each, the smaller proprietors are lightly assessed, wages are higher, and there is a great aspect of contentment and prosperity.\n\nThe people is more homogeneous, there are more heads of clans in the position of taluqdars and fewer mere farmers, court favourites, and city Musalmans. The average size of the farms is small; there are only one and two-thirds of an acre for each adult head of the agricultural population; the farms average 3\u00bd acres; the profits of cultivation after paying for labour are calculated to be about two rupees per acre; the human\nlabour at the market price is worth about Rs. 30 per annum; therefore a tenant with 3\u00bd acres will be worth about Rs. 37 per annum, and if his cattle are his own, unburthened by debt, he may be worth Rs. 48. What with bad seasons, unforeseen expenses, the small tenant is generally in debt, and his net earnings in that case will be about Rs. 30 per annum.\n\nWhen again the rent is a grain one the tenant's income can be still more easily calculated. I found tenants of the Lodh caste in pargana Khairabad irrigating the wheat crops from which the landlord was to take more than half the produce; the process of division was for the landlord to take first two sers in the maund or one-twentieth under the name of village management expenses, g\u0101on kharcha, town cesses in fact, and then divide evenly with the tenants.\n\nNow in a farm of five acres which a family and a pair of bullocks can cultivate, the average value of the crops has been estimated at Rs. 14 per acre. Allow Rs. 18 because the Lodh is a good cultivator, the total produce will be Rs. 90. Deduct one-twentieth and halve the remainder, the Lodh family will have Rs. 43 or the cost of the keep of bullocks (Rs. 12) being deducted, Rs. 31 per annum for their maintenance, just the average price of labour. If the family is in debt, the interest it will have to pay must be deducted from that sum. In many cases the grain division is not so harsh to the tenant.\n\nI append details of crop divisions taken from the patw\u0101ri's papers. The following is an extract from a village record, pargana Khairabad, village Binaura:\n\nA crop of s\u0101nw\u0101n was appraised or estimated at 73 sers per bigha. From this the landlord first took 7\u00bd sers\u2014viz., 1\u00bd for his servant, the patw\u0101ri, \u00bc ser a weighing fee, 5 sers for lambardari right; the tenant then took 5\u00bd sers as k\u016br or ploughman's allowance, there was left 60\u00bd sers. This was divided equally, but from the tenant's 30 sers were deducted 1\u00bd sers for the lambardar, called village expenses. Thus the tenant got 30\u00bd sers + 5\u00bd \u2212 1\u00bd, therefore he received 34\u00bd sers, and the landlord 38\u00bd. In another case in the same village the crop was 178 sers. It was actually measured and the chaff resifted; 18 sers went to the lambardar\u2014viz., \u00bc to the patw\u0101ri, 2 for weighing, and 12 to the landlord, the remainder was divided equally; the tenant got therefore 80 sers and the landlord 98. In both the above instances the tenant gets only 46 to 44 per cent. of the gross crop.\n\nThe following is however more usual. First, one ser is weighed out for the patw\u0101ri, then one-half sers for the weigher, then two or two and a half for the lambardar\u2014in all four sers; then three, four, or even seven and a half sers for the tenant, and the remainder is divided half and half. The tenant getting from 44 to 60 per cent. of the gross crop.\n\nCaste in very few instances acts as a protection. The bhala m\u0101nus or respectable man often escapes paying lambardar's dues, but this privilege is confined generally to Brahmans or Chhattris, nor is it extended to all\nof them. The other castes\u2014Ahirs, Kurmis, Lodh, Chamars, Pasi\u2014are taxed equally; in some villages the second g\u00e1on kharcha is remitted from Ahirs and Kurmis and exacted from Chamars, in others all are treated alike.\n\nThe entire heap before anything is taken out is called panchom\u00e1l, the five shares, a remnant probably of the ancient idea formulated in Manu that the state should take one-fifth. In all proportional statements of village cesses or allowances it must first be noted whether the incidence is upon the panchom\u00e1l or upon the tenant's share. It will be observed that the patwari is paid by both parties, but as the landlord can, according to Oudh law, discharge him at his pleasure, and can pay him as he pleases, he must be considered as the landlord's servant.\n\nThe following remarks are by Mr. Williams:\n\n\"The division of the crops,\" writes Mr. Williams, \"is made thus\":\u2014\"In every maund 3 sers are first given to the zamindars as wages of patwari and village expenses; then 7\u00bd sers to the cultivator as k\u00e1r; and the remaining 29\u00bd is shared between the cultivator and the zamindar. Even low-caste cultivators get k\u00e1r: for if not allowed it they find it more profitable to accept work on the roads or the barracks, a striking proof, if proof were wanted, of the levelling effects of British rule on the caste system.\n\nThirty kachcha bighas are cultivated by one plough. Of these wheat is sown in ten bighas, and some other rabi crop, but which does not require irrigation, such as gram or urd, is sown in five bighas. In these five bighas kharif crops are also grown\u2014ice in the field which afterwards grows gram, kodo in the field which afterwards bears urd. There are fifteen bighas left, and in these kharif crops of all sorts are grown. Thus one-half of the cultivated area is under rabi and one-half under kharif; two-thirds of the former being under wheat. As a general rule, about two-thirds of the wheat area is irrigated. In other words, only two-ninths of the entire rabi area under crops is irrigated.\"\n\nAverage outturn of the principal crops.\u2014By enquiries in some thirty villages the average outturn of the principal crops was found to be as follows:\n\n| First-rate wheat irrigated and manured | 9 kaohcha maunds per kacha bigha. |\n|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Second class                          | 7 ditto.                         |\n| Third                                 | 5 ditto.                         |\n| Best urd                              | 6 ditto.                         |\n| Second class                          | 3 ditto.                         |\n| Third                                 | 1\u00bd ditto.                        |\n\nThe three qualities of rice and kodo 5, 4, and 2 maunds.\n\nThe three qualities of gram 5, 3, and 2 maunds.\n\nThe three qualities of b\u00e9jra 3, 2\u00bd, and 1\u00bd maunds.\n\nWages.\u2014Wages differ but little throughout the district, but owing to the thinness of population are higher than in Bara Banki. For instance, the agricultural labourer in Mahmudabad engaged by the month receives\nthree rupees instead of two rupees or two rupees eight annas. If working by the day at raising water from wells or tanks he receives two annas, near the towns and in rural neighbourhoods, near Mahmudabad, 1\u00bd panseris of urd or ju\u00e1r, and \u00bc sers of parched gram or Indian-corn, thus in all 8\u00bd kachcha sers; and as 2\u00bd kachcha sers equal one regulation ser, it will appear that his wages are almost four sers pakka. Such grain at present (January, 1874); is worth ten panseris or 22\u00bd sers for the rupee; the labourer will then receive grain worth 2\u00bd annas or Rs. 4-12 per working month of 28 days; but this is an exceptionally high rate. In this district, however, labour is harder than in Bara Banki; here they have the deorha not the duna system of relief\u2014that is to say, six men working at a well will only have a relief of three men instead of six. Nine men then will be employed instead of fourteen at a dodandi well, four pulling up the leathern bag, with two for a relief, one attending to emptying the bag, one to the water channel, and one to the proper distribution over the crop. In Biswan wages at irrigation are one anna and a kachcha ser of coarse grain per day; this will be Re. 1-12-0 in cash and 11 sers grain, now worth 8 annas or Rs. 2-4, per month of 28 days. Ploughmen are generally paid by receiving one-sixth of the crop. It is very remarkable that the price of labour should vary 100 per cent. between Biswan and Mahmudabad.\n\nAgricultural capital and operations.\u2014The soil especially towards the east is very sandy, but it is easily cultivated. The cottier tenant requires hardly any capital; a plough costs 20 annas, a hoe 10 annas, a sugarcane mill 4 to 5 rupees, a pair of oxen 25 rupees. A cart is not needed; it would stand him Rs. 60; ordinary agricultural implements and stock would not cost above Rs. 40.\n\nIrrigation.\u2014Water lies at a considerable distance from the surface in the greater part of the district; the levers then which are so commonly used in Bara Banki, and the earthen pitchers wound upon a pulley used in Kheri are not common here.\n\nAccording to the survey it is the worst irrigated district in Oudh leaving out of the comparison the moist sub montane districts which hardly require water at all. The irrigated area is 154,840 acres, the unirrigated 759,258, but doubtless there was some concealment of the irrigation capabilities of the parganas at the time of survey in order to obtain a light land assessment.\n\nIrrigation from tanks and rivers which cover 5\u00b771 per cent. of the surface is not much used, the water is costly, and unlined wells, which will admit of a leather bag, are only found in a belt running through the centre of the district.\n\nNine men working such a well as detailed above will irrigate 1 to 2 kachcha bighas a day. In Mahmudabad two kachcha bighas are equal to seventeen biswas of a regulation bigha nominally, really to about fifteen; consequently a kachcha bigha equals about 1,140 square yards or 4\u00bd to the acre (in Biswan a kachcha bigha is equal to 1,008 square yards). The\nnine men will cost paid in grain Re. 1-9, and if two kachcha bighas a day are watered, one irrigation will come to Rs. 3-8 per acre. Generally grain is not so dear as it is this year. But taking one and a half bighas as the average day's work, and two annas worth of grain as the average pay, the cost of one watering will be Rs. 3-3 per acre, by the cheapest method generally applied. Tanks are little used in many places because they are wanted for the cattle whose owners are too lazy to dig wells. In some parts of the district water is nearer the surface and irrigation is somewhat cheaper. It is possible that the cultivators understate the area irrigable; but considering the depth at which water is reached, 30 feet, the statement harmonizes with facts elsewhere recorded. Bullocks are sparingly used for dragging up the leather buckets being probably reserved for ploughing. There is no superstition against their use in this district apparently; some say that human labour is cheaper, because six men will do the work of two bullocks and one man. This argues a very low standard of human comfort. The real reason seems to be that owing to cattle disease and the poverty of the people, bullocks are so scarce that there are scarcely enough for the ploughs.\n\nIn pargana Khairabad, for instance, I found wells which had been dug to the depth of 38 h\u00e2ths, or 57 feet. The water was lying at a depth of 33 feet, six men pulled up the leather bucket; here it would have been cheaper probably to use bullocks. But in point of fact the question of cheapness can hardly have been considered at all. The cost of irrigation as it was being actually carried on before my eyes in January, 1874, exceeded the value of any increase of crop which the owner could hope to obtain. The owner of a few acres had prospected for a well site; he had made a bad guess; he had dug 75 feet without meeting a spring, and had then stopped after spending Rs. 17. He tried again, and at 57 feet he got enough water to water one local bigha a day with the labour of 11 men. The watering season will last from January 10th three weeks at the utmost, in that time the owner would irrigate 20 bighas or four and a quarter acres at a prime cost of Rs. 27 for the two wells, and a labour cost of Rs. 20-8, or Rs. 11-3 per acre, for a single watering. In this case the landlord probably anticipated a famine, and that prices would rise so as to recoup him. The wells would be useless for the next year, as they would fall in in the rains; he probably watered his wheat because his ploughmen would have been otherwise idle than in obedience to any calculation of profit or loss. Such land was not assessed as irrigated for Government revenue; the supply of water being considered so precarious.\n\nPloughing and harrowing are performed much more perfunctorily than in eastern Oudh, and there is no regular rotation of crops. Manure costs, if purchased, Rs. 4 to 5 per acre according to distance of field. A pair of plough bullocks will cost Rs. 24 to 28 if of local breed, Rs. 35 to 50 if from Pilibhit or Dhaurahra. They will work from 20 to 40 local bighas, viz., from 4\u00bd to 8\u00bd acres. Grain is carried on the backs of ponies which will carry two maunds pakka or 164 lbs, the driver carrying 20 sers or 40 lbs on his back. Buffaloes and carts are used more sparingly, except on the main roads.\nRents.\u2014Rents are uneven. The rates given in the official returns are as follows:\n\n| Crop       | Rs. per acre |\n|------------|--------------|\n| Rice lands | 4 3          |\n| Wheat      | 5 7          |\n| Gram, barley, maize | 3 10 |\n| Cotton     | 6 1          |\n| Opium      | 9 12         |\n| O' seeds   | 4 2          |\n| Sugar      | 10 2         |\n| Tobacco    | 10 14        |\n\nThese are about correct averages, but near Mahmudabad, an inferior portion of the district, I found sugarcane Rs. 2 the kachcha bigha; wheat lands Re. 1-8 to Rs. 2; maize, kodo, and other inferior lands 10 annas to Re. 1-4. At Biswan tobacco lands were from Rs. 2 to Rs. 5-4 per kachcha bigha; wheat Re. 1-8 to Rs. 2 the bigha, being exactly 1,008 square yards; this will reach Rs. 25-6-0 per acre for tobacco.\n\nDebts: rate of interest.\u2014A much smaller proportion of the tenantry were in debt than in Bara Banki, which is probably owing to their holding more generally upon grain-rents whose elasticity enables them better to tide over bad seasons. Still many of them owed a great deal more than they were worth, and most dated their embarrassments from annexation. Probably the money-lenders conceived that there then arose some security for repayment and let them have advances. Interest is the same as elsewhere, 24 to 36 per cent. on good security, 18 per cent. on large transactions, and usurious arrangements such as \"up\" for the mere tenant without property.\n\nThe entire land revenue of the district is Rs. 14,31,000; and about two-fifths belong to the wealthy lords of Mahmudabad, Aurangabad, Rampur, Bilahra, Basahi, Dih, and other places. The taluqdars, 30 in number, have 6,76,383 acres in 1,019 villages, paying a revenue of Rs. 6,50,277, or 15 annas 5 pies per acre; the small proprietors have 741,176 acres, paying a revenue of Rs. 7,03,400, or 15 annas 2 pies per acre.\n\nPrices.\u2014A table showing the prices for the last ten years has been prepared for the Secretary of State, a copy is appended. It does not, however, contain the cheaper grains such as kodo and sanw\u00e1n, which as in Bara Banki form a main resource of the people. Kodo at present, January 2nd, 1874, is selling at 36 sers for the rupee, and that which has become matna or spoiled with dew, so that its consumption causes paralysis is selling for 38 sers. If such grain is husked and used as rice it becomes harmless; urd is now 22\u00bd sers for the rupee, 70 per cent. dearer than kodo, maize is 24\u00bd, gram 20, and wheat 16\u00bd.\n\nThese prices are considerably lower than those ruling in Lucknow and Bara Banki although there has been the same drought, there are the same apprehensions of scarcity, and water supplies in the shape of wells are still more precarious. It is partly accounted for by the thinness of population, partly by the fact that rice, the great failure of the year, is comparatively a minor crop here, and maize and ju\u00e1r have been good. Kodo was obtainable in October, 1873, at 43 sers for the rupee.\nStatement showing details of produce and prices in Sitapur district for ten years 1861 to 1870.\n\n| Produce                        | Average |\n|--------------------------------|---------|\n|                                | 1861    | 1862    | 1863    | 1864    | 1865    | 1866    | 1867    | 1868    | 1869    | 1870    | Average of ten Years |\n| Paddy                          | 34      | 49      | 61      | 33      | 28      | 26      | 34      | 38     | 22      | 26      | 25\u00bd     |\n| Common rice (husked)           | 23      | 28      | 28      | 16      | 13      | 14      | 18      | 19      | 11      | 13      | 18\u00bd     |\n| Best rice (husked)             | 9       | 10      | 10      | 10      | 9       | 9       | 9       | 9       | 9       | 9       | 9\u00bd      |\n| Wheat                          | 23      | 30      | 39      | 18      | 20      | 16      | 23      | 29      | 12      | 19      | 22      |\n| Barley                         | 34      | 53      | 66      | 41      | 27      | 28      | 27      | 50      | 21      | 34      | 38      |\n| Bajra                          | 27      | 43      | 51      | 31      | 28      | 26      | 27      | 48      | 33      | 39      | 39\u00bd     |\n| Juar                           | 86      | 44      | 50      | 32      | 25      | 26      | 39      | 49      | 22      | 22      | 34\u00bd     |\n| Gram                           | 25      | 48      | 45      | 30      | 17      | 17      | 36      | 36      | 17      | 17      | 28\u00bd     |\n| Arhar (Cylium cajan)           | 24      | 47      | 45      | 33      | 33      | 18      | 25      | 40      | 31      | 23      | 29\u00bd     |\n| Urd or mas (Phaseolus maz)     | 25      | 44      | 33      | 23      | 16      | 16      | 18      | 36      | 17      | 17      | 24\u00bd     |\n| Mothi (Phaseolus aconitifolius) | 26      | 38      | 43      | 25      | 31      | 21      | 26      | 44      | 19      | 19      | 28\u00bd     |\n| Mung (Phaseolus mungo)         | 16      | 39      | 25      | 15      | 12      | 14      | 17      | 24      | 13      | 13      | 18      |\n| Masur (Ermen lene)             | 26      | 37      | 50      | 29      | 20      | 19      | 20      | 44      | 19      | 19      | 29\u00bd     |\n| Ahas or matra (Pisum sativum)  | ...     | ...     | ...     | 23      | 21      | 27      | ...     | 19      | 20      | 22      |\n| Ghaiyan (Arum colosca)         | 18      | 66      | 86      | 44      | 16      | 45      | 33      | 27      | 28      | 38      | 41\u00bd     |\n| Sarson (Sinapis dichotoma)     | 16      | 18      | 15\u00bd     | 17\u00bd     | 19      | 20      | 17      | 17      | 14      | 14      | 17\u00bd     |\n| Lahi (Sinapis nigra)           | ...     | ...     | ...     | 23      | 20      | 23      | 33      | 33      | 18      | 18      | 32\u00bd     |\n| Raw sugar                      | 4       | 5       | 5       | 5       | 5       | 4       | 5       | 4       | 4       | 4       | 4\u00bd      |\n\nFamine.\u2014There has never been a serious famine in this district since 1837, and even concerning it the reports are somewhat conflicting. There have been a great number of scarcities notably since annexation. Famine prices seem to be reached when no grain is under fifteen sers for the rupee. The district was verging on famine for a few months at the close of 1869, but a plentiful crop restored the balance. The following details for the entire division of Sitapur are drawn from a report prepared for the Oudh Government in 1867. Sitapur apparently always suffers with its neighbour Hardoi, except perhaps that locusts and hail storms do more damage in the latter district.\n\n\"The Deputy Commissioner of Sitapur reports that from local enquiry it appears in 1769-70 as well as 1784-85, 1837-38, and 1860-61 famine extended to Oudh, owing particularly to want of rain and dryness of the weather. The immunity from famine referred to in the letter under reply is attributable principally to the fact that there was little or no export from the country as compared with other provinces.\n\n\"The Deputy Commissioner of Hardoi states that of the famine of 1769-70, I can in these parts learn but little. It is said that there was a famine but no particulars of it are still matter of common report. The latter fact may indicate that it was not a famine of great severity.\n\n\"The famine of 1784-85 is well known. It is called the 'h\u00e1rah sadi famine' by the Muhammadans and the 'ch\u00e1l\u00edsi' famine by the Hindus; it having taken place in 1200 Hijri or 1840 Sambat. From want of rain it continued for two years. The scarcity was very great, and the loss of\nlife from starvation great. Children were disposed of by sale or abandoned; some reports, which are possibly untrue, say that they were roasted and eaten.\n\n\"The famine of 1837 was felt. A little rain fell in the early part of the usual rainy season; but was not followed by rain, and none fell till the end of Bh\u00e1don when it rained for one day only. There was not so great distress here as in parts further west, but the distress was much increased by the influx of people from other parts. Grain sold at eight sers for the rupee.\n\n\"In 1860 rain fell seasonably but not in abundance, and there was scarcity but not drought or famine. The officer reporting states that he has no knowledge of 'meteorology or of the divine counsels,' and cannot account for the uncertain incidence of famine. Nothing is said about the scarcity of 1864-65.\n\n\"The Deputy Commissioner of Kheri reports:\u2014It would appear that Oudh was visited by a severe famine in 1253 fa\u0161li (1837 A.D.) It is known among the natives as 'tirpana' from the year 53 or tirpan in which it occurred. Grain sold as low as 8 sers and under for the rupee, and there was great distress throughout the land. The scarcity was not in any way owing to local causes, but owing to the influx into the country of the starving population of the North-Western Provinces.\n\n\"In 1860-61 there was no scarcity although the price of grain rose, owing to the large exports of grain made by the traders in the province to the north-west.\"\n\nIn 1865, in 1869, and in 1873, the same thing has happened; the rains ceased early; a poor rice-crop was the result, and there was little water in the tanks for irrigating the spring crops, while there was no rain except an occasional drizzle from October till February.\n\n**Statement of Prices.**\n\n*Retail sale\u2014quantity per rupee.*\n\n| Articles          | July, 1869 | August | September | October | November | January, 1870 | February, 1870 |\n|-------------------|------------|--------|-----------|---------|----------|---------------|----------------|\n|                   | Md. s. c.  | Md. s. c. | Md. s. c. | Md.s.c | Md.s.c | Md. a. c. | Md. s. c. |\n| Wheat, 1st quality| 0 12 1     | 0 10 13 | 0 10 15   |        |        | 0 10 13      | 0 10 5        |\n| Ditto, 2nd quality| 0 12 4     | 0 11 2  | 0 11 6    |        |        | 0 11 5       | 0 10 10      |\n| Gram, 2nd quality | 0 12 13    | 0 11 1  | 0 11 4    |        |        | 0 10 11      | 0 10 13      |\n| Bajra             | 0 10 4     | 0 9 14  | 0 10 0    |        |        | 0 19 1       | 0 20 1       |\n| Ju\u00e1r              | 0 8 5      | 0 8 0   | 0 9 0     |        |        | 0 20         | 0 23 2       |\n| Arhar             | 0 15 3     | 0 12 15 | 0 13 1    |        |        | 0 12 4       | 0 18 5       |\n| Urd               | 0 12 1     | 0 10 14 | 0 11 0    |        |        | 0 17 7       | 0 17 8       |\n| Mas\u00far             | 0 16 5     | 0 13 14 | 0 14 0    |        |        | 0 10 4       | 0 19 5       |\n| M\u00e1ng              | 0 8 5      | 0 8 0   | 0 7 6     |        |        | 0 16         | 0 14 15      |\n| Rice, 2nd quality | 0 7 6      | 0 7 2   | 0 8 10    |        |        | 0 11         | 0 11 14      |\nFish.\u2014The Collector of Sitapur says young fish are caught, but not to any great extent; they are taken by damming in the smaller streams during the dry weather, and in irrigated fields during the rainy season. The minimum size of the mesh of nets employed is about a quarter of an inch; no difficulty exists in regulating its size, which might be fixed at one inch. He opposes altogether prohibiting the sale of the fry of fishes, observing\u2014'no real harm is done by catching young fish in tanks, jhils, or irrigated fields, for these fish, if left alone, would never find their way back to the river.' Captain Thompson, in 1868, reported from this place\u2014\"fishing goes on at all seasons of the year, and there can be no doubt that in the small rivers and tanks the supply would be materially increased by a short 'close time.' Still I hardly think that the protection is necessary in the large rivers. But the narrow and shallow streams of this district can be well nigh cleared of fish with the net, and the supply is scanty in consequence. In such rivers the protection of the spawning fish would, no doubt, have a very good effect.\"\u2014Pura. 283, \"Francis Day's Fresh-water fish and fisheries of India and Burma.\"\n\n\"At Sitapur the native official observes that the Kahars and Guryas take fish at certain times, but their regular occupation is agriculture. The local markets are not fully supplied. Large fish obtain two annas, small ones one anna a ser, mutton two annas a ser. He is unable to give the proportion of fish-eaters. The general opinion is that fish have increased, due to several consecutive years of floods. The smallest size of the mesh of nets is given at a quarter of an inch. Fish are trapped during the rains in the irrigated fields. The native names of the nets and traps in use are pandi jal, locari jal, maha jal, kharia jal, patia jal, palma jal, tapa jal.\"\n\nManufactures.\u2014The only manufactures of any note are those of smoking tobacco and tazias at Biswin, with a little cotton printing and weaving in Biswan, Khairabad, and generally in all the towns. In Biswan there are one hundred houses of weavers; the same remarks as those already made about Bara Banki weaving apply to Sitapur, except that country thread has not been so entirely displaced in the latter district. The same complaints are heard that cotton is dearer, and that English cloths have now actually lowered the price offered for the local products. Native thread sells here for Re. 1-4-0 to Re. 1-8-0 per ser; English from Rs. 2 to Rs. 2-8-0. No emigration of the distressed weavers from this neighbourhood has as yet taken place.\n\nRoads aggregate, length 266 miles.\u2014Like all other districts in the province, Sitapur is well provided with good unmetalled roads, running in all directions, and generally carried over the smaller streams by bridges, many of which were built before we took the country. In addition, there is the fine metalled high road from Lucknow going on to Shalihampur; travellers from either of which cities reach Sitapur in eight or nine hours by post chaise or dak gari. Hardoi is a 12 hours' journey to the west of Sitapur by palanquin post, and a similar means of locomotion takes the traveller in nine hours to Lakhimpur in the north,\nThe following is an extract from the official route book:\n\nRoads.\u2014There are two metalled roads\u2014one from Sitapur to Lucknow, the other to Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur. The former passes for $33\\frac{1}{2}$ miles through the district; the stages from Sitapur are Jal\u00e9lpur 11 miles, Bah\u00e1durpur 10\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), Ja\u00edp\u00falpur 10; the only river is the Gon, which is bridged. The latter passes for 23 miles through the district; the stages are Maholi, 14\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) miles from Sitapur; other stages are in the Kheri district; the only river is the Sar\u00e1yan which is bridged. The district unmetalled roads are\u2014\n\n1. From Sitapur to Lakh\u00edmpur; the only stage within this district is Selamau, 10 miles from Sitapur.\n\nThere are no rivers.\n\n2.

This is only 19 miles long; the stages are Bhandia seven miles from B\u00e1ri and Mahmudabad 12. No river.\n\nLand measures: local weights.\u2014The rate of rent is always per \"kachcha\" or small bigha throughout this district. This is supposed to form one-third of a regulation bigha containing 3,025 square yards, in which case about four and three-quarters local bighas go to an acre. But the measurement of this unit varies with the pleasure of the landlord, his servant the p\u00e1twari being the surveyor. All the fields have been, it is true, surveyed and mapped out by Government; elaborate maps and records of the field areas are in the muniment rooms at every tahsil; a duplicate is at the headquarters, and a triplicate in the hands of the patw\u00e1ri, but in all money* rented and appraised\u2020 fields the patw\u00e1ri remeasures the fields at each harvest affixing the rent agreed upon. If the land is under garden crops a smaller local bigha is used, but apparently there is not so much variation in this respect as in the district of Bara Banki. When the crop is actually divided there is of course no necessity for measurement at all.\n\nThe local weights vary in every bazar just as is related in the Bara Banki district article; the local maund being from 16 to 20 regulation sers, and the local sers one-fortieth of it.\n\n* Jama.\n\u2020 Kit.\nCHAPTER III.\n\nTHE PEOPLE.\n\nPopulation\u2014Tenures\u2014Table exhibiting the tribal distribution of property\u2014List of taluqdars.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The population of the district numbered at the census of 1869 so many as 930,224 souls living in 181,764 houses; and as its area is 2,250 square miles, these figures show that there are 414 inhabitants to the square mile, and 5\u00b71 to each house against a provincial average of 476 and 4\u00b75 respectively.\n\nHindus and Musalmans.\u2014Of this population there are 812,776 Hindus against 117,448 Musalmans; the latter being thus 12\u00b76 of the entire number, which is something higher than the provincial percentage of 10\u00b77.\n\nMale and female.\u2014There are 494,833 males against 435,391 females, the males forming the majority in each of the two great religions.\n\nRural and Urban population.\u2014The population may further be divided into rural and urban as follows:\n\n| Rural | Urban |\n|-------|-------|\n|       |       |\n| 880,542 | 49,682 |\n\nTotal ... 930,224\n\nWhich shows that the inhabitants of the towns are 5\u00b74 per cent. of the whole; this is something lower than the provincial average of 7\u00b71 per cent., but is still the 5th highest among the twelve districts, the percentages of which range from 31\u00b77 for Lucknow to 1\u00b73 for Partabgarh.\n\nPrincipal castes, Musalmans.\u2014The principal Musalman castes, if we may so call the subdivisions of the Muhammadan population, are as follows:\n\nPath\u00e1ns ... 17,694\nShekhs ... 10,459\nSayyads ... 2,734\nMughals ... 1,940\nJulah\u00e1s, weavers ... 30,895\nKanjras, greengrocers ... 4,289\nGhosis, milkmen ... 3,649\nQas\u00e1s\u00eds, butchers ... 2,138\nDarris, tailors ... 7,025\n\nThe remainder is made up of inconsiderable numbers of:\n\nDyers.\nMusicians.\nCutlers.\nWater-carriers and others.\n\nHindus I.\u2014High castes.\u2014Among the Hindus the chief castes are the following:\n\nSikhs ... 248\nKhattris ... 1,468\nBrahmans ... 99,596\nRajputs ... 39,696\nVaishyas ... 16,745\nK\u00e1yaths ... 12,587\nJ\u00e1ts ... 650\nII.\u2014Low caste.\u2014The low-caste tribes are principally distributed thus:\n\n| Tribe                  | Number |\n|------------------------|--------|\n| Ahir, cowherds         | 85,509 |\n| Bhunjwa, grain-parchers| 12,584 |\n| Bh\u00e1t, bards            | 4,664  |\n| Barhi, carpenters      | 10,974 |\n| P\u00e1si, watchmen, labourers, &c. | 72,771 |\n| Arakhs, ditto ditto    | 2,832  |\n| Tamol\u00ed, pawn-sellers   | 5,676  |\n| Teli, oilman           | 20,904 |\n| Cham\u00e1r, tanner and labourers | 111,745 |\n| Halw\u00e1\u00ed, confectioner    | 4,163  |\n| Dhobi, washerman       | 15,483 |\n| Dhunia, labourer, cotton-cleaner | 11,886 |\n| Kah\u00e1r, palki-bearers   | 26,367 |\n| Sug\u00e1r, goldsmith       | 4,248  |\n| Kumh\u00e1r, potter         | 7,685  |\n| Kurmi, cultivators and zamindars | 74,597 |\n| Kalv\u00e1r, distillers     | 8,993  |\n| Kori, weavers          | 14,209 |\n| Garasia, shepherds     | 16,444 |\n| Lodh, cultivators      | 36,146 |\n| Lon\u00eda, cultivators and saltpetre manufacturers | 8,429 |\n| Loh\u00e1r, ironmiths       | 11,865 |\n| Murk\u00f3, gardeners and cultivators | 32,593 |\n| N\u00e1u, barbers           | 19,776 |\n\nBhars and Th\u00e1rus.\u2014There are 319 \u201cBhars\u201d in Manw\u00e1n, B\u00e1ri, and 18 \u201cTh\u00e1rus\u201d in L\u00e1sharpur. These low-caste Hindus do not all necessarily follow the peculiar occupation of their tribe, for many of them engage in agriculture in common with Lodhs and Kurmis.\n\nReligious professions.\u2014The Hindus who have adopted religion as a profession are the following:\n\n- Gosh\u00e1\u00edns: 4,040\n- N\u00e1naksh\u00e1h\u00eds\n- Jog\u00eds and others: 8,505\n\nbut among these we find some (of the Gosh\u00e1\u00edns) in possession of land as zamindars. The foregoing account of the population of the district does not deal with the numbers of the troops, European and native, or with the Europeans and Eurasians, temporarily stationed in it.

the division of property. Some of the information given in the settlement report tables is hardly correct, and some requires explanatory comments. We are told, for instance, that there are 104,760 resident cultivators, and 53,705 non-resident cultivators, but the large majority of the latter have been reckoned as residents in their own villages, and are counted again as non-residents for other villages in which they occupy and till fields.\nThe table No. IV. merely states how many villages are zamindari, pattidari, and bhayyach\u00e1ra. The taluqdari villages are recorded at 937 in form No. IV., but at 1,019 in a list of their estates furnished by the Deputy Commissioner. There are about 1,150 villages in estates paying above Rs. 5,000 revenue.\n\nSoils.\u2014We find, what are called first, second, and third class soils in the following proportions:\n\n| Class | Proportion |\n|-------|------------|\n| 1st   | ...        |\n| 2nd   | ...        |\n| 3rd   | ...        |\n\nThe first class in this district is mati\u00e1r or clay, which in all other districts has been reckoned second class.\n\nAppendix No. IV., Settlement Report, shows us at a glance how many mauzas in the collectorate are zamindari and how many taluqdari, noting at the same time how many of the latter are held in sub-settlement. From it we learn that 937 villages, being 36 per cent. or a little more than one-third of the entire number, are in taluq\u00e1s, and that of these only 43 have been decreed in sub-settlements. But this does not represent the entire under-proprietary rights of the ex-zamindars, for column 4 of the same statement informs us that in 146 other villages smaller holdings, that is to say s\u00eer, dh\u00eehd\u00e2ri, and n\u00e2nk\u00e2r lands, have been decreed.\n\nThe sub-tenures.\u2014In every instance whether of an entire village, a portion of village or a s\u00eer, &c., holding, the rent payable by the sub-proprietor to the taluqd\u00e2r has been fixed for the term of the present settlement at an amount in the computation of which the two principal factors are, the rent payable under native rule, and that now assessed by the settlement officer as payable by the taluqd\u00e2r. Speaking generally, no under-proprietor pays for his tenure more than 75 or less than 60 per cent. of the estimated gross rental \u201cnik\u00e2si kh\u00e2m.\u201d In some cases we find the ex-zamindars with rent-free n\u00e2nk\u00e2r and dh\u00eehd\u00e2ri lands, but this is exceptional. From Appendix No. VII. we gather that the profits of the general body of under-proprietors amount to Rs. 27,531 for the whole district.\n\nOf s\u00eer land the statement would show that each sub-proprietor has acres 36. But this is not quite correct, for each of these sub-proprietors has a number of pattidars or co-sharers, perhaps ten or even fifteen on an average, which would bring each actual sub-proprietor\u2019s holding down to ten or fifteen kachcha b\u00eeghas. And as these ten or fifteen co-sharers in the natural order of things increase and multiply, their tenures will be further split up, so that we may expect in the course of another generation to find a very numerous body of small under-proprietors living more or less from hand to mouth, except in the case of those families who may be fortunate enough to have a son or brother in Government employment, and thus able to contribute ready money towards meeting the rent on quarter day. This, however, is only a speculative contingency which need not be dwelt upon here.\n\nThe taluqdari villages.\u2014The statement further shows that the 937 taluqdari villages are distributed among thirty taluq\u00e1s, the areas of which, with the Government demand payable on the same, and the profits of the taluqdars, are detailed in Appendix No. VII.\nThe zamindari and the pattidari villages.\u2014We also see that here are 1,635 villages, or not quite two-thirds of the district other than taluqdari, and classified as zamindari, pattidari, and bhayyach\u0101ra. These are all held by brotherhoods similar to the ordinary village communities of Hindustan, the great majority of them being Hindus of the Rajput, Kayath, Kurni, and Brahman castes. The non-taluqdar proprietors, who appear from the appendix to number only 2,301, are in reality many more. For every zamindar whose name is recorded in the khewat is a proprietor, and in many villages such persons number so many as forty or fifty, while in others they are only four or five; so that instead of two thousand there are actually nearer twenty thousand proprietors.\n\n### Statement of Tenures, &c.\n\n| Name of Tehsil | Name of pargana | Tenures and number of villages, &c., of each kind | No.

These officers are generally of three grades, drawing from Rs. 200 to Rs. 150. Their headquarters are in the principal town of the area of their jurisdiction. The list of parganas and tahsils is given in Chapter I. The following is a descriptive sketch on all tahsils by Mr. M. L. Ferrar, B.A., C.S., assistant commissioner.\n\n\"The tahsils.\u2014As related in the preceding pages, Sitapur is divided into four tahsils, each being in charge of a native tahsildar, under the orders and subject to the control of the deputy commissioner of the district. These officers are vested generally with criminal and civil court powers, and are also judges between landlord and tenant. They further are entrusted with many executive duties, such as the serving of revenue processes for the due payment of the state rental by the zamindars, the care of the public revenues, the execution of decrees, and much other miscellaneous work.\n\n\"As a territorial subdivision of the country the tahsil is altogether a British institution, and embraces several of the native subdivisions formed by the Emperor Akbar and styled by him 'parganas.' Of these there are 21 in the whole district, and they are fully described in their proper places where the reader will find information as to the rural statistics of the country, its history, details of population, and area, natural productions, bazars, great fairs, and the like. In the present place it will be sufficient to give the population, area, and boundaries of each tahsil as an integral portion of the whole district.\n\n\"Tahsil Sitapur\u2014Is bounded on the north by the Kheri district, and runs down through the centre of the district; its greatest length being 38 and its extreme width 26 miles. In area it is 564 square miles, of which 357 are cultivated, and its population numbered at the census of 1869 246,801 souls, or 433 to the square mile. It contains 650 demarcated villages, \"mauzas,\" and 48,029 houses, to each of which there are 5-1 inhabitants.\n\n\"Tahsil Biswan\u2014Lies in the north-east corner of the district; its northern boundary being the district of Kheri and its eastern the Bahraich district,\nwith the river Gogra flowing between. Its extreme length and breadth are 38 and 27 miles, and its area is 575 square miles, of which 397 are cultivated. Its population numbers 244,028, living in 43,821 houses, and 509 villages. Thus to each square mile and house there are 426 and 4\u00b75 inhabitants respectively.\n\n\"Tahsil Bari\"\u2014Is a long rectangular tract, 36 miles by 20, lying in the south of the district and to the north of the districts of Bara Banki and Lucknow. Its area is 498 square miles, 336 of which are under cultivation. There are 548 villages, containing 46,615 houses, and its population being 238,598, we see that to each square mile there are 479 souls, and to each house 5\u00b709.\n\n\"Takei Mirrikh\"\u2014Forms the western subdivision of the district, and lies to the east of the Hardoi district and the river Gumti. Its extreme length is 43 miles, and its greatest breadth 20; and its area is 613 square miles, of which 385 are cultivated. The villages are 657, and the houses 43,229; and its population of 201,367 gives an average of only 328 to the square mile and 4\u00b76 to each house.\"\n\nPolice.\u2014For police purposes the district is divided into nine police circles, the headquarters of each being the thana.\n\nThanas.\u2014The strength of the force is 544 men of all grades, and the thanas are at Sitapur, Bari, Maholi, Mahmudabad, Misirkh, Biswan, Lakharpur, Tambaur, Thanaon, and Khimauna, in addition to which there are three police posts (chausis)\u2014Rudrpur, Jalalpur, and Bahadurpur on the Lucknow road, and a fourth at Nimkhair.\n\nCattle pounds.\u2014The police are in charge of the cattle pounds, of which there are ten in different parts of the district.\n\nChaukidars.\u2014The village police are the chaukidars, numbering in all 3,815 men, and armed with a spear or a sword. These two bodies constitute the ordinary police force of the district.\n\nTown police.\u2014A special force of town police exists in Sitapur, Khairabad, and Biswan numbering 61, and in addition to these are 18 men in charge of the military cantonments.

There are now 111 Government schools of all grades in the district at which the number of scholars on the books is 4,052, or about 1 to every 228 of the entire population. Of these 4,052, it is to be noted that 114 are girls. There is an aided mission (Wesleyan) school at Khairabad, with a roll of 80 pupils, the headquarters of the Mission being at Sitapur.\n\nPost-offices.\u2014The following statements are supplied by the Post-office authorities.

Further details concerning each family will be found under the pargana in which it resides.\n\nA few general remarks may be made concerning the present distribution of property in the district among the clans, and their earlier history. To the east the Raikw\u00e1rs occupy most of the country between the Chauka and Kauri\u00e1la, north and south Kundri, forming part of the block of territory extending north and south about sixty miles along both sides of the Kauri\u00e1la, over which for one or two centuries the Raikw\u00e1rs have exercised a real or nominal supremacy. The great estates of Baundi and R\u00e1mnagar are fully described under articles Bahraich and Bhitauli; here it need only be stated that the younger branches of the clan settled at Mall\u00e1pur, at Chahl\u00e1ri, and R\u00e1mpur\u2014all on the western bank of the Kauri\u00e1la. The ancestor of each branch got three or four villages, and has gradually increased his possessions through the aid and influence of the great lords of his blood in Baundi and R\u00e1mnagar. The estate of Chahl\u00e1ri was forfeited after the mutiny for rebellion. The clan is a very small one in point of numbers.\n\nTo the north in parganas Sitapur, L\u00e1harpur, Harg\u00e1m, Chandra, and Tambaur, the great Bamhan Gaur clan from N\u00e1rkanjari settled itself towards the close of \u00c1lamg\u00edr's reign. It was a resolute and warlike body of men. It commenced by attacking the Ahbans and the Janw\u00e1rs of Kheri which were driven into exile about A.D. 1760. The Gaurs then proceeded further to the north-west having meanwhile consolidated their power in Sitapur and L\u00e1harpur; they attacked the Musalman r\u00e1ja of Muhamdi, defeated and drove him out. At length the Rohillas came to the aid of the r\u00e1ja and drove back the Gaurs with heavy loss; the last battle was fought at Mail\u00edni, twenty miles north of Kukra, so far had the Gaurs carried their victorious arms. They then joined with the R\u00e1ja of Dhaurahra in resisting N\u00e1zim S\u00edt\u00e1l Parsh\u00e1d, the most sanguinary of all the satraps whom the early Oudh Nawabs let loose upon the conquered country. They were defeated with heavy loss at Dhaurahra; one of their chiefs was beheaded in the river under the fort of Khairigarh, and the clan then settled down into ordinary rustic squires.\n\nTo the south the Kh\u00e1nz\u00e1da family of Bilahra, in the Bara Banki district, has within the last seventy years occupied most of the parganas of Mahmudabad, Sadrpur, besides acquiring large estates in Bisw\u00e1n, by mortgage or simply as trustee. This family has generally numbered among its members men of ability and energy; they were connected by marriage with the influential Shekhz\u00e1sas of Lucknow, and were used by the Lucknow court as a check upon the great Raikw\u00e1r r\u00e1j along the Gogra, which their principality almost cut in two.\nTo the east the Abbans held formerly parganas Nimkh\u00e1r, Aurangabad, Maholi, and part of Khairabad, besides parts of districts Kheri and Hardoi, Lone Singh, the great raja of Mitauli, was banished for rebellion in 1859, and his estate divided among a number of loyal grantees. His only brother tried in vain to recover a part of the property which once is said to have included 2,700 villages. The Abbans produce a family tree with 109 generations; they are Chawar Chhattirs and came from Gujrat. Almost the only survivor of the clan in Sitapur is called a Kunwar, and is a man of little property or influence. The clan is now of no importance, so hollow and transitory is the power of these great landowners. A number of deeds were produced in the Kheri courts in which the Abbani chiefs are styled Mah\u00e1r\u00e1jas by the Emperors Akbar and Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr; they were skilfully executed forgeries. Their former parganas are now held by Mughal grantees from the Oudh kings, by K\u00e1yaths and others, probably retainers of the ancient Abbans.\n\nThe middle portion of Sitapur is held by many different clans of Chhattris. Originally there was a powerful Chauh\u00e1n sovereignty in Sitapur, and a Raghubansi principality in Tambaur; they have both disappeared. A variety of clans occupy each a pargana or the greater part of a pargana, except in Bisw\u00e1n and Khairabad which were the seats of local governors, who took care to destroy the co-herence of the clan system by breaking up its possessions and distributing them miscellaneously. It is remarkable that no clan except the Gaura asserted its supremacy over large areas like the Kanhpurias, Sombansis, or Bais in southern Oudh; it is a mistake, indeed, to call them clans: each is a collection of a few families, of whom the eldest member was the leader, and was called the Th\u00e1kur. These gentlemen increased their estates during the latter Nawabi times by appropriating the shares of their brethren.\n\nThe land owning clans are the following:\n\n| Pargana       | Name of Chhattri clan                  |\n|---------------|----------------------------------------|\n| In Gundlamau | B\u00e1chhils                               |\n| ,, Bari      | Bais                                   |\n| ,, Pirnagar  | Bais                                   |\n| ,, Manw\u00e1n    | Panw\u00e1r                                 |\n| ,, R\u00e1mkot    | Janw\u00e1r                                 |\n| ,, Kureusa   | Janw\u00e1r                                 |\n| ,, Machhrehta| Kachhw\u00e1ha, Janw\u00e1r, B\u00e1chhil, Bais, R\u00e9thor |\n\nIt may be observed that the Janw\u00e1rs are mainly to the west of the Sar\u00e1yan river, the Bais to the east; both of these clans are probably of indigenous origin as are also the B\u00e1chhils and the Raghubansis. The Panw\u00e1rs, Kachhw\u00e1has, Gaurs are immigrants from R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. None of the above clans have a raja in the district; from outside the district the Abb\u00e1n raja of Mitauli, the Panw\u00e1r raja of Itaunja, and the Raikw\u00e1r raja of Baundi did to a certain extent exercise a control over their clansmen in the district. But it is noteworthy that there is not in the district a single raja by descent recognized as such by the people, the title is not even claimed by any one: The special feature of the Sitapur land proprietary is the existence of a number of men, about fifteen, with large estates paying Rs. 5,000 to Rs. 19,000 land revenue, who have not been entered in the\ntaluqdar's list. Practically this is now no loss to them, and in some respects is an advantage.\n\nAntiquity of the clans.\u2014About the origin or antiquity of these clans little need be said. The Bais are not Tilokchandi at all, and the assertion of the taluqdars to that effect is in defiance not only of the statement of the admitted descendants of the great Baisw\u00e1ra chief but is opposed to all chronology. For instance, they make Todar Mal a contemporary of Tilok Chand's, although the latter died in the reign of B\u00e1bar. The Bais really belong to the very numerous clan of Kath Bais, whose power seems to have centered in Kursi pargana and Gundwa pargana of the Lucknow and Hardoi districts; these are only separated from the Bais colony in B\u00e1ri and Pirmagar by the B\u00e9chhil intruders of Gundlamau. These Bais are probably some aboriginal tribe which assumed the title of Rajput after the break-up of the Buddhist system. The r\u00e1jas and r\u00e1os of Baisw\u00e1ra deny that they have any, even illegitimate, connexion with themselves, or are in any way descended from S\u00e1lb\u00e1han, the great ancestor of the Tilokchandis. The Janw\u00e1rs are also probably aboriginal. The Raghubansis allege a descent from the former rulers of Ajodhya; they possibly are of the S\u00farajbans blood; they had four large estates each of 44 villages in pargana Kundri, but have none now. The K\u00e1yaths allege very old tenures in Bisw\u00e1n and Sadpur, but their statements are not confirmed.\n\nJanw\u00e1r Chhattris.\u2014K\u00e1lka Bakhsh, of R\u00e1mkot, pargana R\u00e1mkot. The family which this gentleman represents has, it is said, lived in R\u00e1mkot for some 300 years. Its early history is obscure. The immediate predecessor of K\u00e1lka Bakhsh, Hardeo Bakhsh, distinguished himself by profuse expenditure on works of public utility. A very fine tank at R\u00e1mkot, and the long and fine avenues of trees upon all public roads converging on the village, still attest his great liberality. K\u00e1lka Bakhsh was a foundling, and Hardeo Bakhsh having no heir adopted him as his son. Subsequently, and contrary to his expectations, a son was born to him. The adopted son succeeded to the estate on his father's death, and took the management while the son was a minor. The latter holds half the estate under his adopted brother. K\u00e1lka Bakhsh, in the rebellion of 1857, received into his fort a British officer who escaped from the massacre at Sitapur, and forwarded him on towards Lucknow where he arrived safely. An estate of the annual rental of Rs. 1,000 was conferred upon him by Government for this act of loyalty.\n\nGaur Chhattris, Pargana L\u00e1harpur.\u2014\n(1).\u2014Th\u00e1kur Shiu Bhaksh Singh, of Katesar.\n(2).\u2014Th\u00e1kur Beni Singh, of K\u00e1nhm\u00e1u.\n(3).\u2014Th\u00e1kur Shiu Bhaksh Singh, of B\u00edhat.\n(4).\u2014Fazl Ali Khan, of Akbarpur.\n(5).\u2014Bah\u00e1dur Singh, of Keshopur.\n(6).\u2014Munnu Singh, of Barehta.\n\nThese six gentlemen and a large number of smaller landholders in the Sitapur district date their family history from their ancestor Chandar\nSen, whom tradition asserts to have been of royal descent in N\u00e1rkanjari. He came to Oudh in the time of \u00c1lamg\u00edr Aurangzeb, about A.D. 1658. From his four sons\u2014Ajit Mal, N\u00e1g Mal, Khark Sen, and \u00dadho R\u00e1m\u2014are descended a large family of Gaurs who have absorbed nearly the whole land in the Sitspur, L\u00e1harpur, and Chandra parganas. Their descendants are known by the name of the ancestor of each branch. Of the six great taluqdars detailed above the three first are known as N\u00e1g Mals, the three last as Ajit Mals, and of the smaller zamindars, descendants of the four sons of Chandar Sen, each preserves the family appellative of his own line. Of the N\u00e1g Mals, Tej Singh, one of their ancestors, was invested with the title of r\u0101ja about A.D. 1650.\n\nMusalm\u00e1n Gaur Rajput.\u2014Th\u00e1kur Fas\u00ed Ali Khan, of Akbarpur, pargana L\u00e1harpur, is a Musalman. The estate of this branch was confiscated three generations back in consequence of certain disturbances in which the head of the family Mah\u00e1bali took part. It was, however, restored to him on condition of his embracing the Musalman faith, which condition he accepted. Since then the family have been Muhammadans, but they still observe Hindu customs, and mix with the Hindu members of the family on friendly terms, observing only those distinctions which the diversity of religion renders compulsory.\n\nRaikw\u00e1r Rajput.\u2014Th\u00e1kur Gum\u00e1n Singh, taluqdar of R\u00e1mpur, Mathura, pargana Kundri, is the present representative of a family which have held the R\u00e1mpur property for the last 680 years. They claim relationship to Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja Jai Chand, said to have formerly ruled Oudh when it was subordinate to Kanauj; and they came from their native town Raika, in the Jummuo territory, seventeen generations back. Family tradition holds that the estate, at that time lying waste, was conferred on their ancestor for services against the notorious dacoits named S\u00e1rangdhar and Kap\u00fardhar of the Bhar caste. Beyond this nothing is known of their family history.\n\nOther branches of this stock held estates in R\u00e1mmagan, in Bara Banki, in Rahwa, and Har\u00edharpur in Bahraich, and in Mall\u00e1pur in Sitspur.\n\nThe Chahl\u00e1ri estate in Sitapur, and the Baundi estate in Bahraich, belonged also to members of this family, but were confiscated for rebellion in 1857.\n\nR\u00e1o Muneshar Bakhsh, of Mall\u00e1pur, is related by blood to the R\u00e1mpur taluqdar, and his family have held this estate for ten generations, before which they occupied, it is said, lands in Banndi.\n\nAs in the case of the R\u00e1mpur family, their exact history is not known, but tradition assigns a common origin to the two families.\n\nBais Chhattris.\u2014Mahr\u00e9j Singh, taluqdar of K\u00e1hnhmau, pargana B\u00e1ri. This family traces its descent from Tilok Chand, who is said to have been the father of all the Bais clan in Oudh. He is said to have come from M\u00e1ngi P\u00e9an in the west; but the connexion of this family with\nthe great Tilok Chand is fabulous, and they have no commensality with the real descendants of that monarch. Bh\u00edkham Singh and Th\u00e1na Singh came to Behrimau, in P\u00edrnagar, in the service of Diw\u00e1n Kesho D\u00e1s, who was agent for Dost Muhammad Khan and Pir Muhammad Khan, at that time Subahdars in Oudh, and who held the lands as j\u00e1gir. On the resumption of the j\u00e1gir, thirteen years later, Bh\u00edkham Singh and Th\u00e1na Singh remained in possession as zamindars. For three generations the estate was undivided, but in the time of Jagat R\u00e1\u00e9 the estate was divided between his two sons, K\u00e1h\u00ed Singh and Madkar Sah\u00e1e; K\u00e1h\u00ed Singh took the K\u00e1h\u00edmau estates, and is the ancestor of the present representative, Mahr\u00e1j Singh. The father of the latter was rewarded for loyal services in the rebellion by a grant of land of the annual value of Rs. 2,000, and was made Honorary Assistant Commissioner in his own estates.\n\nJaw\u00e1hir Singh, taluqdar of Besah\u00edd\u00edn, pargana B\u00e1ri. This gentleman is descended from Madkar Sah\u00e1e, brother of K\u00e1h\u00ed Singh, and is therefore nearly related to the K\u00e1h\u00edmau family, of which Mahr\u00e1j Singh is the present head. Jaw\u00e1hir Singh was rewarded for loyal conduct in the rebellion of 1857 by a grant of land of the annual value of Rs. 5,000. He afterwards was made an Honorary Assistant Commissioner, but was allowed to resign office in 1863. He was convicted of taking part in a riot attended with loss of life in November, 1873, and was imprisoned for seven years with fine of Rs. 10,000.\n\nPann\u00e1r Chhatr\u00ed.\u2014Harihar Bakhsh, taluqdar of Saraura, pargana Manw\u00e1n. The family of this taluqdar came from Gwalior about A.D. 1602, and the three brothers, Malam Deo, Ph\u00fal Deo, and M\u00e1\u00ed Deo, from whom the family are descended, possessed themselves of large estates in Itaunja, Mahona, Saraura, and Nilg\u00e1on. The descendants of Malam Deo still hold the Itaunja estates in the Lucknow district. The last representative of the family of Ph\u00fal Deo, Digbijai Singh, lost the Mahona estates for rebellion in 1857, and the descendants of M\u00e1\u00ed Deo hold the estates of Saraura and Nilg\u00e1on; the family estates of that branch having been divided by the two brothers, Binda D\u00e1s and Har\u00ed D\u00e1s, in the third generation from M\u00e1\u00ed Deo.\n\nThe Saraura family, of which Harihar Bakhsh is the head, is descended from Binda D\u00e1s.\n\nTh\u00e1kur Durga Bakhsh, of Nilg\u00e1on, pargana Manw\u00e1n. This gentleman is descended from Har\u00ed D\u00e1s in the third generation from M\u00e1\u00ed Deo. He was rewarded for good and loyal services in the rebellion of 1857 by a grant of land of the yearly rental of Rs. 1,000.\n\nK\u00e1yath.\u2014Th\u00e1kurs Anant Singh, Jagan N\u00e1th Singh, Ganga Bakhsh, and Hardeo Bakhsh, taluqdar of R\u00e1mpur Kal\u00e1n, pargana Bisw\u00e1n. The ancestor of this family received in reward a j\u00e1gir of 20 villages about A.D. 1150 from the king of Delhi, and he and his family have lived in Bisw\u00e1n since that time. Such is the family chronicle, but it may be remarked that Oudh was not in the kingdom of Delhi at any time during the twelfth century.\nThey were at one time driven out by the Bhars, but were subsequently restored in the reign of Akbar some twenty years later, and the office and title of q\u00e1n\u00fango were then conferred on the head of the family. The present representative is q\u00e1n\u00fango of Bisw\u00e1n. Th\u00e1kur Dari\u00e1o Singh, the father of these gentlemen, was rewarded for loyalty during the rebellion of 1857 by the grant of an estate of Rs. 1,000 rental.\n\nAnother branch of the main stock is represented by the non-taluqdar\u00ed family of Chaudhri Arjun Singh.\n\nKhattri.\u2014Seths Sita R\u00e1m and Raghubar Day\u00e1l, taluqdar of Moiz-ud-dinpur, pargana Bisw\u00e1n. The ancestor of this family, Jiwan D\u00e1s, came from Delhi about 1720 with Nawab Sa\u00e1dat Khan, and received from him a grant of 137 villages. In the third generation the estate was seized by the Government, but about A.D. 1820 a portion of it, known as Moiz-ud-dinpur, was restored. The rest was confiscated. These taluqdars' predecessor, Murli Manohar Seth, was rewarded for loyalty during the rebellion by a grant of land of the annual value of Rs. 2,000, and remission of Rs. 1,000 from his revenue. He held the office of treasurer of the Sitapur district.\n\nSita R\u00e1m Mehra, taluqdar of Bisendi, pargana Bisw\u00e1n. The ancestor of this gentleman was a Delhi banker, who came to Oudh about 200 years ago and settled in Lucknow and Bisw\u00e1n, in which places the family have been bankers ever since. The greater part of the estate was acquired in A.D. 1863 by purchase. Sita R\u00e1m Mehra was rewarded for loyalty during the rebellion by the grant of an estate of the yearly rental of Rs. 2,000.\n\nKh\u00e1ns\u00e1da.\u2014R\u00e1ja Am\u00edr Hasan Khan, taluqdar of Mahmudabad, pargana Mahmudabad. This gentleman is descended from Shekh Nath\u00fa, who about 1360 A.D. was employed by the king of Dehli against the Bhars, and was rewarded for good services by the grant of large estates in and about Fatehpur. In the fourth generation D\u00e1d\u00ed Khan was invested with the title of \"Nawab,\" which was supplemented by several additional distinctions \"Muzaffarjang,\" \"Bah\u00e1dur,\" &c., in the time of Bazid Khan in the sixth generation, but these titles died with him. In the twelfth generation a division of estate took place between the issue of Muhammad Im\u00e1m Kh\u00e1n.\n\n| Muhammad Im\u00e1m Khan. |\n|---------------------|\n| Muhammad Ikr\u00e1m Khan. | Mashar Ali Khan. |\n| Mus\u00e1hib Ali Khan and Sarfar\u00e1z Ali Khan. | Am\u00edr Ali Khan. |\n\nThese two branches divided the estate in equal portions. Mus\u00e1hib Ali Khan and Sarfar\u00e1z Ali Khan dying childless, Mus\u00e1hib Ali's widow managed,\nthe estate during her life, and before her death adopted one of the sons of Am\u00edr Ali Khan, named Nawab Ali Khan, who succeeded her in possession of her estate. The other, and elder son of Am\u00edr Ali Khan, named Ib\u00e1d Ali Khan, succeeded to the whole of Am\u00edr Ali Khan's estate, which is now known as the taluqa of Paintepur. In 1850 the title of r\u00e1ja was conferred upon Nawab Ali Kh\u00e1n by the king of Oudh, and in 1852, the titles \"Muq\u00edm ud-daula\" Bah\u00e1dur \"Q\u00e1im Jang\" were added. The present r\u00e1ja owes his title to the British Government. Nawab Ali Khan died in 1858 during the rebellion; and on re-occupation by the British, his son, then a minor, was placed under the Court of Wards.\n\nThe estate is the largest in the Sitapur district. It was brought to its present condition mainly by the exertions of Mus\u00e1hib Ali Khan, his widow, and Nawab Ali Khan. The caste of this family is Musalman Shekh, but they are usually called Kh\u00e1nz\u00e1das, because at some remote time the title \"Khan\" was conferred on one of their ancestors.\n\nMuhammad K\u00e1zim Husen Khan, taluqdar of Paintepur Bilahra, pargana Mahmudabad. This taluqdar is the son of R\u00e1ja Ib\u00e1d Ali Kh\u00e1n. It is said that the title of r\u00e1ja was conferred on R\u00e1ja Ib\u00e1d Ali Kh\u00e1n in 1853 by the king of Oudh, but it was not recognized by the British Government.\n\nAr\u00e1b.\u2014Mirza Muhammad Ali Beg, taluqdar of Aurangabad, and Mirza Ahmad Beg, taluqdar of Qutubnagar, pargana Mahmudabad, have for their ancestor Mirza Bah\u00e1dur Beg, otherwise known as Farrukh F\u00e1l, an Arab, who settled at Delhi in the time of Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n about 1644 A.D. In the reign of Aurangzeb he received a grant of land in N\u00edms\u00e1r then a large pargana, and in honour of the king he named the estate Aurangabad, by which name the pargana is known to this day, the old name of N\u00edms\u00e1r having fallen into disuse. It is said that the estate consisted of 1,500 villages. Of the four sons of Bah\u00e1dur Beg, the two youngest returned to their native country, the two remaining divided the estate, the elder Sa\u00e1dat Khan retaining the main portion, and the second, Y\u00e1r Ali Beg, receiving the Qutubnagar estate.\n\nMugh\u00e1l.\u2014Nawab Amjad Ali Khan,* taluqdar of Sendhur estate, pargana Khairabad. This nobleman is the son of M\u00fanawwar-ud-daula, formerly W\u00e1z\u00edr of Oudh, who acquired the estate during his tenure of office.\n\nPath\u00e1n.\u2014R\u00e1ja Shamsher Bah\u00e1dur, taluqdar of Sa\u00e1datnagar in Sitapur, pargana Misrikh and Jal\u00e1lnagar in Hardoi. The family of this gentleman are commonly called Mughals, but are really Y\u00fasufzai Path\u00e1ns. An ancestor followed N\u00e1dir Shah from K\u00e1b\u00fal to Delhi in the year A.D. 1734, and more recently the great-grandfather of the present r\u00e1ja, Mirza \u00c1gha Muhammad Ali Beg, came to Oudh in command of troops, and was rewarded for good services by the grant of an estate. The father of the present representative was created a r\u00e1ja by W\u00e1jid Ali Shah the king of Oudh, which title his son inherits.\n\n* Has died since these remarks were written.\nSAYYAD.\u2014M\u00edr Muhammad Husen, taluqdar of K\u00e1li, pargana Misrikh and R\u00e1j\u00e1para. This gentleman is a native of Budaun, where he has some small landed property. He entered the service of the Oudh Government and was chakladar for some time, and afterwards rose to be a collector. During his tenure of office he became possessed of his present estate by mortgage. The precise history of this family is not known. One brother was killed during the rebellion, and another, Fida Husen, commonly known as \"Captain,\" is now a taluqdar in the Kheri district.\n\nThe non-talugdari families.\u2014The following gentlemen have large property and influence, although they are not taluqdars:\n\nJANW\u00c1R CHHATTRIS.\u2014Th\u00e1kur M\u00e1dh\u00f3 Singh, &c., of Jargaw\u00e1n in pargana Kurauna, tahsil Misrikh. The history of this gentleman's family has been lost, and beyond the fact that their ancestor came to Oudh from Janakpur about 400 years ago even tradition is silent. The names of the heads of the family cannot be traced back beyond four generations; but of these four it may be recorded that one was in possession of the estate for 75 and another for 72 years, instances of longevity which can hardly be equalled in any family in the district.\n\nJANW\u00c1R CHHATTRIS.\u2014Th\u00e1kur D\u00e9bi Singh, of Bani\u00e1nmau, in pargana Machhrehta, tahsil Misrikh. Tradition assigns a very ancient date to the first acquisition of the estate by the head of this family. The genealogical tree extends back over 33 generations and 1,149 years. Beyond the names and dates, however, little or nothing is known, except that the family came originally from Gujarat.\n\nBeni Singh, taluqdar of Ulra, in pargana Bisw\u00e1n, tahsil Bisw\u00e1n. This gentleman's family have lived in Sitapur for fourteen generations. Their ancestor was Dewa R\u00e1m, who came from Jaipur and settled in Oudh about A.D. 1510. Beyond the genealogical tree little or nothing is known.\n\nTh\u00e1kur Balbhaddar Singh, of Bujhara, in pargana Sadpur, tahsil B\u00e9ri, is descended from Hastr\u00e1j, a native of Gwalior, and a ris\u00e1l\u00edd\u00e1r in the Oudh service. The estate belonged to the Bhars, a race at that time in process of extermination, and now extinct. It is supposed that the estate was conferred on Hastr\u00e1j for good service, and that he drove out the Bhars and took possession.\n\nBAGHUBANSI CHHATTRIS.\u2014Gop\u00e9 Singh, taluqdar of Bamhnaw\u00e1n, in pargana Kundri, tahsil Bisw\u00e1n. The family of this gentleman is descended from S\u00e1th\u00e1n R\u00e9e, a resident of Ajodhya, who about A.D. 1072 settled in the Mall\u00e1pur du\u00e1b driving out the aborigines from Garh Qila. The history of the family is obscure, but it is certain that the estate has suffered much in recent times, and that the family of Baghubansis, formerly a large and powerful clan, is gradually dying out.\n\nIn that portion of the du\u00e1b still known as Garh, and which comprises nearly the whole of pargana Kundri, a tradition exists that the cultivation of sugar is fatal to the cultivator, and that the tiling of a house brings\ndown divine displeasure upon the builders. To this day no sugar is grown nor a house tiled in the whole of the Garh estates. The origin of this tradition has been lost.\n\nThakur\u00e1in of Shiu Bakhsh Singh, of Sikri Sipauli, in pargana Tambah, tahsil Bisw\u00e1n. This lady is also a descendant of S\u00e1than R\u00e1e, and inherits part of the old family estates of Garh Qila. The history of the ancestors been has lost though their names have been preserved. The separation of branches took place in the third generation from S\u00e1than R\u00e1e. These two families alone possess property in this district of the once all powerful Raghubansis.\n\nKunwar Chhattris.\u2014Ranjit Singh, Munnu Singh, Mah\u00edpat Singh, taluqdar of Deokalia, in pargana Bisw\u00e1n, tahsil Bisw\u00e1n. The history of this family has been lost, but they trace their pedigree back for eleven generations, and believe themselves to belong to the aboriginal inhabitants of Oudh. They are Ahbans of the Mitauli family.\n\nKachkudha Chhattris.\u2014Widow of Hari Singh, Bhikham Singh, Raghu-n\u00e1th Singh, Bijai Singh, and Z\u00e1l\u00edm Singh, taluqdars of Bihat Bair\u00e1m, in pargana Machbrehta, tahsil Misirkh. This family descended from Bair\u00e1m Singh, an inhabitant of Jaipur, who settled in Oudh about 1459 A.D. The family history is unknown, but the names of the various members of it have been preserved for eleven generations back to Bair\u00e1m Singh, from whom the taluqa derives its name (Bihat Bair\u00e1m). The present representatives were honourably distinguished in the rebellion of 1857 by protecting European fugitives, for which they were rewarded by a grant of land of the annual value of Rs. 443.\n\nConverted K\u00e1y\u00e1t\u00e9.\u2014Muhammad Bakhsh, taluqdar of Sarwa Jal\u00e1lpur in pargana Bisw\u00e1n, tahsil Bisw\u00e1n, is a member of the same family as Th\u00e1kur Anant Singh. The estate was divided in the third generation, and both branches remained Hindu until recently. The grandfather of Muhammad Bakhsh was his father's only son by a Muhammadaan mother, and the estate descended to him in default of Hindu heirs.\n\nS\u00f3ch.\u2014Chaudhri Lutf Ahmad and Ghul\u00e9m Ahmad, taluqdars of All\u00e1-d\u00e9dpur in pargana B\u00e1ri, tahsil B\u00e1ri. This family has lived in the Sitapur district for ten generations. They were originally Hindus, but their ancestor, Part\u00e1b Singh, is said to have suffered from a boil, and for its cure to have been anointed with the fat of cows when insensible, in consequence of which he turned Musalman. About this time he received in reward from the king of Delhi an estate in the Sitapur district, into which, according to the custom of those days, he had to fight his way with the sword. He was subsequently appointed Chaudhri of B\u00e1ri, which post his family have held for ten generations. Part\u00e1b Singh had three sons (Hindus) by his first wife, and one son (a Musalman) by a second marriage. The larger estates in B\u00e1ri are held by the descendants of the Musalman branch, and some smaller estates are still in possession of the Hindu family, descendants of the three sons of his first marriage.\nEvents of the mutiny in 1857 A.D.\u2014A description of this district would hardly be complete without an account of the mutiny and outbreak of the native troops stationed at Sitapur in 1857. The following graphic account by Mr. Martin Gubbins, who bore so prominent a part in the defence of Lucknow, will well repay perusal. With it ends this notice of the district of Sitapur, it being only sufficient to add here that on the restoration of order in 1858 the Government offices were re-opened, and that ever since the district has enjoyed complete repose, and the people are rapidly progressing in the march towards prosperity and civilization.\n\nOutbreak of the troops, 3rd June, 1857.\u2014The first outbreak took place at Sitapur, the headquarters of the Khairabad division, of which Mr. G. J. Christian was Commissioner. On the 4th of June, a scrap of paper containing a few lines, without any signature, brought in by a police horseman, stationed on the Sitapur road, announced to us that some European refugees from that station required assistance. Captain H. Forbes at once started from Lucknow with a party of mounted volunteers and Sikh horsemen to escort them, and every carriage, buggy, and conveyance available was sent out to bring them in.\n\nLate in the evening they arrived; a party of men, ladies, and children, worn and exhausted, having travelled all that day in the burning sun, and all the preceding night. Some of the ladies had ridden the whole way, others with the children had been conveyed in buggies. Many of the ladies had returned by this time from the Residency to my house, and we now gladly received a party of the Sitapur refugees, viz., Mrs. Apthorp and three children, and Mrs. and Miss Birch. The other officers and ladies were accommodated at the Residency at Mr. Ommaney's and in the houses of the garrison; this party of the fugitives had been escorted in by about thirty sepoys of the 41st regiment, native infantry, to which they themselves mainly belonged. About half these men had from the first protected them, and had started with them, the second half had followed and joined them on the road not without suspicion of their having come with evil intention. But there being several well-armed officers of the party, if such ill designs had been harboured they were not attempted. All the men therefore were most cordially received by Sir Henry Lawrence; high praises and promises of reward were given them; and they were placed under their own commander, Major Apthorp, in the Machohhi Bhawan. Strange is it that, within one fortnight, even these men could no longer be trusted. A Christian drummer overheard some mutinous discourse, and it was thought best to tender to them the option of returning to their homes. When this offer was made, it was gladly accepted by all without exception, and not a man remained with the officers whose lives they had before saved.\n\nSome days after, by ones and twos, other fugitives arrived. Mr. Bickers, a clerk, and his family, who had been concealed (and kindly treated by the villagers, Lieutenant Lester, Assistant Commissioner, who spoke highly of the kindness and aid which he had experienced from the people who had escorted him from village to village. This officer joined\nmy garrison. About three weeks afterwards arrived a native cart escorted by a few villagers containing Mr. Dudman, a clerk, and his family, and several other East Indians; with them arrived Mrs. Dorin, whose husband while commanding the 10th regiment, Oudh irregular infantry, at Sitapur, had been butchered before her eyes. She was dressed in native clothes, had been lodging in a native village for more than a fortnight, and now found a home in our house. All this party spoke highly of the kindness with which they had been treated; and, with Sir Henry Lawrence's sanction, I sent to the zamindar who had thus protected them an official document promising him high reward.\n\nFrom all these parties we fully learnt the sad particulars of the mutiny at Sitapur. At that station were quartered the 41st regiment of native infantry, the 9th and 10th regiments of Oudh irregular infantry, and the 2nd regiment of military police. The troops rose on the 3rd of June. The outbreak had long been feared, and the Commissioner, Mr. Christian, who maintained a bold and manly bearing throughout the anxious time, had collected the civilians and their families at his house, which he proposed to defend by aid of a strong guard of the regiment of military police which he believed to be staunch. He had advised his military friends to send their ladies to him also for safety, but fortunately this had not been done. One lady from cantonments alone came, Mrs. Stewart, and she with extraordinary prudence took a good survey of the position. On two sides of Mr. Christian's compound flowed the small river Sar\u00e1yan, and there was no means of reaching the high road but through the military cantonments. Considering the position to be unsafe, she returned to her home, and fortunately was one of the first party of refugees. On the morning of the 3rd June, a cry was raised in the lines of the 41st regiment that the 10th irregulars were plundering the treasury; and as the men were in a state of excitement, the commander, Colonel Birch, who reposed the most entire confidence in his men, called out the two most suspected companies, the light and the rifle, and led them to the treasury. All there was found to be quiet, and the colonel was about to return, when a sepoy of the guard stepped out of the ranks and shot him in the back. Colonel Birch fell from his horse dead; and Lieutenant Smalley and the sergeant-major were then killed. The adjutant, Lieutenant Graves, escaped wounded, through a volley of bullets. The mutiny soon spread to the irregular regiments. In the 9th regiment the commandant (Captain Gowan) and his wife, the second in command (Lieutenant Greene), and the Assistant Surgeon (Mr. Hill) were destroyed. Mrs. Greene escaped. In the 10th regiment the commander (Captain Dorin) the second in command (Lieutenant Snell), his wife, and child were murdered. Mrs. Dorin (whose arrival had been mentioned) and the Adjutant (Lieutenant Burnee) escaped.\n\nCaptain John Hearsey, commanding the 2nd regiment military police was protected by some of his men, and escaped. At Mr. Christian's bungalow the scene must have been fearful. At the commencement of the outbreak he proceeded outside to put in readiness the guard of military police in whom he confided. The wretches immediately turned and fired on him. Flying back into the house, he alarmed the assembled inmates; and the men, ladies,\nand children fled out of the bungalow on the opposite side of the house which faced the river; pursued and fired upon by the miscreants of the military police, and other regiments which now joined them, some were shot down before they reached the stream, others were killed in it, a few perished on the opposite bank, two or three only escaped, viz., Sir Mountstuart Jackson and his two sisters and little Sophy Christian, who was saved by Sergeant Major Morton. There fell Mr. and Mrs. Christian and child, Mr. and Mrs. Henry Thornhill and their children, and several others. Those who escaped broke into two parties. Lieutenant Burnes, Sir Mountstuart, and Miss Madeline Jackson, Sergeant-Major Morton and little Sophy Christian found refuge, though an unwilling one, with the R\u00e1ja Lone Singh at his fort of Mitauli. Mrs. Greene, Miss Jackson, and Captain John Hearsey fled northwards, and, after being joined by other refugees, found shelter at Mathi\u00e1ri with the R\u00e1ja of Dhaurahra, whence also they had soon to fly.\n\nThe following account of a battle near Bisw\u00e1n and subsequent proceedings is taken from Sir Hope Grant's Sepoy War:\u2014\"On the 13th April we marched at daybreak, but had scarcely gone three miles on our way when I heard the advanced guard commence firing. The road or rather track had been very bad, and I had remained behind to see the heavy guns brought across a n\u00e1la. I immediately galloped to the front, and found that a strong cavalry picket of the enemy had attacked our advanced guard, had surrounded a troop of Wale's horse, wounding one of the officers, Prendergast,* and would have taken the two guns which were with it, when they suddenly perceived a squadron of the 7th Hussars, which the dust had hitherto prevented them from seeing, ready to charge them, whereupon they wheeled about and galloped off. When I reached the scene of the conflict I saw this hostile force, which now amounted to some thousand men, working round our right flank, evidently bent on attacking our baggage, which extended over a line of nearly three miles. I instantly brought up 300 cavalry and two of Mackinnon's guns to protect our flank, and fired several shots at them, but without effect. In addition to our rear guard, I ordered the Bengal Fusiliers to cover our right flank. I sent a troop of the 7th Hussars to patrol along both flanks, and another squadron to watch the movements of the sowars. The enemy came round in rear of a village, and were in the act of charging upon our baggage when the troop of the 7th Hussars, who were ready prepared for them, dashed down and galloped through them, putting them to flight and sabring many of their number.\n\n\"Captain Topham,\u2020 who commanded the troop, and who had run a native officer through the body, was wounded by a lance. He had two men mortally and six men slightly wounded. A little after another body of the rebels charged down upon our baggage, but were met by two companies of the Bengal Fusiliers, who poured a volley into them when within 30 yards distant, which rolled a number in the dust. Thereupon they desisted from further attacks, and retreated as quickly as possible.\n\n* Now Major M. M. Prendergast, second in command of the 4th Bengal cavalry.\n\u2020 Captain R. Topham is now in command of the 16th Bengal cavalry.\n\"The infantry were then ordered to advance. The enemy occupied a village on a hill in front of us, at the base of which a stream flowed. Large columns were posted on both sides of this valley. I threw out the rifle brigade in skirmishing order, supported by the 5th Punjab corps. The main line in rear advanced close up to the village under a heavy fire and stormed it gallantly, capturing two colours.\n\n\"We afterwards advanced and took the higher ground, the rebels bolting without firing a shot. The cowardly fellows might, with a little resolution, have defended the position for some time, as the banks and honey-combed ground would have delayed us under fire considerably, but they had no confidence either in themselves or in their leaders. Whether they had artillery or not I cannot say. Our cavalry on the right captured a waggon filled with ammunition, but no guns opened on us.\n\n\"We proceeded to Beleri, three miles distant, and were there told that the Maulvi had commanded the cavalry in person. This I doubt, as all their leaders valued too much their precious lives.\n\n\"The next day we marched to Burassie, 12 miles off. The weather was now becoming excessively hot, and poor Augustus Anson, who had held out so long, was taken very unwell with a dreadful sickness and dysentery. He was obliged to get off his horse, and was carried in a doli.\n\n\"A decoction of the bel fruit, which was now ripe was given to him, and the next day he was in a fair way to recovery.\n\nOn 15th April we marched for Mahmudabad where it was reported Kh\u00e1n Ali Khan had collected a force of 3,000 men. On reaching the town, however, we found it deserted, and the chief's house, though surrounded with mud walls and bastions, left undefended.\"\n\n**SITAPUR Pargana**\u2014**Tahsil Sitapur**\u2014**District Sitapur**.\u2014Pargana Sitapur runs north and south, and in shape resembles a pear; its length being 20 miles and its greatest breadth 9 miles. It is bounded on the east and south by the Sar\u00e1yan, a small stream fordable in the dry weather, but rising to a great height in the rains, on the west by pargana Maholi, and on the north by the district Kheri.\n\nThe superficial area is 115 square miles, of which 67 are cultivated, and the following is the detail in acres:\n\n- 48,029 cultivated,\n- 12,221 culturable,\n- 8,651 revenue-free,\n- 9,794 barren,\n\nmaking up a total of 73,695 acres.\n\nIts villages (mauzas) number 159, besides which there are 11 grants amounting in all to 170.\n\nThere are no hills or lakes in the pargana, and its natural features are those of the greater part of Oudh\u2014namely, a flat fertile country with\n\n* By Mr. M. L. Ferrar, B.A., C.S., Assistant Commissioner.\nnumerous groves. There are many wells; water being found at a depth of from 20 to 28 feet from the surface of the ground.\n\nBeside the bazars in the town of Sitapur there are others at Artia, Sardi, Khamolia, and Kania.\n\nThere are no places of special historical interest in the pargana, and the only sacred buildings deserving notice are the Qazi's Imambara, the Shivala of Sharnath, Mahadeo, and a temple in honour of the mythical Sita\u2014all in the town of Sitapur.\n\nThe population as estimated at the census of 1869 is as follows:\n\n| Hindus, agricultural | 21,796 |\n|---------------------|--------|\n| \" non-agricultural  | 20,035 |\n| Total Hindus        | 41,831 |\n\n| Musalmans, agricultural | 1,950 |\n|-------------------------|-------|\n| \" non-agricultural      | 7,021 |\n| Total Musalmans         | 8,971 |\n\nThe total population of the pargana being 49,896, or 434 to the square mile.\n\nThe Musalmans form about 16 per cent. of the entire population, and the principal castes of the Hindus are Brahmans 6,036, Rajputs 3,918, Kayaths 1,117, Ahirs 2,657, Pasis 4,092, Chamars 6,725, Kahars 1,596, Lodhs 1,085, Muraos 1,766, Kurmis 1,196. The amount of cultivated land per head of agricultural population is 1-90 of an acre, and of assessed land 2-4.\n\nThere are no mines or quarries in the pargana with the exception of some inconsiderable kankar diggings, lime being manufactured from the kankar. The manufacture of sugar is also carried on to some extent, and with these exceptions the productions of the district under notice are of the ordinary description.\n\nThe present assessment amounts to Rs. 66,079, being an increase of Rs. 9,868, or 17\u00bd per cent. on the summary settlement, and giving the following incidence:\n\nOn cultivated land: 19 6 per acre.\nAssessed: 13 2\nTotal area: 0 15 11\n\nThe pargana contains 9,697 houses, which gives an average of 5-1 individuals to each house.\n\nOf 159 villages only five are owned by taluqdars, and of the remaining 154 so many as 115 are held by Gaur Chhattris, and only nine by the Nandwani Chauhans who preceded them in the dominion of the district.\n\nThe climate is good, the productive powers of the soil a good average, and the state of agriculture fair. The rents are almost entirely paid in kind.\n\nThe history of the pargana is traditional only and is as follows:\u2014R\u00e1m Chandar and his consort Sita are said to have sojourned in the place\nwhere Sitapur now stands, which town was founded in her honour by King Bikramajit, who raised a temple to the heroine and called the name of the place Sitapur or the city of Sita. To come to later times, in 590 A.H. (A.D. 1092), or about seven centuries ago, a tribe of Chauhans under Gahildeo, a relative of King Pithiraj of Delhi, invaded the district and drove out the then possessors who were Kurmis and low-caste tribes, and founded a fort in Saadatnagar then called Bhik Gahildeo, and his successors reigned for 10 generations it is said, each reign lasting 50 years. This is manifestly incorrect, but the people believe it and give the dynasty thus: I. Gahildeo, II. Lobang Sah, III. Suraj Sah, IV. Sujan Sah, V. Dara Sah, VI. Lachhman Sah, VII. Kalian Sah, VIII. Chandar Sen, IX. Gutram, X. Hiram.\n\nThese Chauhans are locally known as Nandbansi, and they possess at the present day nine villages only, one of them being the ancient Bhik, now Saadatnagar.\n\nSo Gahildeo and his descendants held sway for five centuries until the reign of Aurangzeb, when (in 1070 A.H.) a tribe of Gaur Chhattis, led by another Chandar Sen from the North-West Provinces, invaded the country and dispossessed the Chauhans from the sovereignty, leaving them Sitapur, Saadatnagar, and Tehar. This warrior king had four sons named Ajit Mal, Nag Mal, Kharak Sen, and Udho Ram, whose descendants are now distinguished from each other by the names of their four progenitors, the Nagmals for instance, being different from the Ajit Mals. They all belong to that caste of Gaurs, which is known as the Bamhan Gaur caste, and they still possess the greater part of the pargana, though a stranger to both them and the Chauhans possesses the town of Sitapur, Gur Parshad Qanungo, whose title rests on a deed of sale to him from the former proprietors.\n\nAs constituted by Todar Mal the pargana consisted of 1282 villages with certain Chaks and fractional parts of a village. The summary settlement recognized 312 villages, which have now at regular settlement been demarcated into 170.\n\nWith the exception of the Ramliila festival celebrated in the town of Sitapur there are no fairs at all held in the pargana.\n\nIn the Ain-i-Akbari this pargana under the name \"Chhittapur\" occurs in the list of muhals making up \"Sarkar Khairabad,\" and to the present day the name is generally pronounced by the villagers as there spelled.\n\nSITAPUR\u2014Pargana SITAPUR\u2014Tahsil SITAPUR\u2014District SITAPUR\u2014Sitapur, the chief town of the pargana of the same name is situated on the small river Sarayan, and is 52 miles north-west from Lucknow, and 53 from Shahjahanpur, the high road between which two places passes through it. The name is derived from that of Ram Chandar's consort, who is said to have tarried in this locality some time during her pilgrimage; and the town itself was founded after the Musalmans had captured\n\n* By Mr. M. L. Ferrar, B.A., C.S., Assistant Commissioner.\nDelhi in her honour by certain Nirbansi Chhattris, whose descendants, as Nandbansis, held it down to modern times. It now belongs to a Kayath family.\n\nThe population numbers 5,780, being pretty equally divided between Hindus and Musalmans, being about 5 of the former to 6 of the latter. There are besides the ordinary Musalman and Hindu religious buildings a temple in honour of Debi, and said to have been founded by Sita, a number of Government buildings, such as a school-house, district offices, jail, dispensary, &c.; and as the place is at the same time the headquarters of a Commissioner, and is garrisoned by European and native troops, there are good bazars in which not only country but also foreign commodities can be purchased. From Sitapur travellers can proceed to Lucknow or Shahjahanpur by dak gari, the roads to either being metalled, and to Hardoi 40 miles, and Kheri 30, by palanquin dak on a good unmetalled road.\n\nThe town and station are prettily situated, with good groves in all directions; an extensive serpentine artificial lake is a great ornament. The Sarayan river meandering to the south-east is fordable in the dry weather, but in the rains rises to a great height, and occasionally as in 1870 floods the town. There is no water communication with any other town; neither canal nor railway come near the place.\n\nThere are no manufactures, no very large fairs, though 8,000 people are said to attend at the Kans-ka-mela in Bhadon (August), nor is the place in any way historically famous. There are 56 masonry and 980 mud-built houses in the native town, attending the school are 170 boys. The bazar sales are estimated to average annually Rs. 4,82,010. The town lies in longitude east 80\u00b043' and in north latitude 27\u00b035'.\n\nSRINAGAR Pargana\u2014Tahsil LAKHYMPUR\u2014District KHERI.\u2014The pargana as it is at present constituted consists of the old pargana of Srinagar, and the trans-Ul portion of the old pargana of Kheri, consisting of 51 villages of that pargana which have been transferred since the census was taken. Previous to this there had been a rectification of frontiers along the Chauka, and the cis-Chauka portion of pargana Dhaurahra, consisting of eleven villages and one grant, were transferred to Srinagar; on the other hand, the trans-Chauka villages of the old pargana of Srinagar now belong to Dhaurahra. The pargana is very irregularly shaped, something between a square and a circle. It is bounded on the west by pargana Bhur; there is no natural boundary, and the line of separation is irregular and about 21 miles in length; on this side the pargana is only 15 miles in length from north to south. On the south it is 24 miles broad, and is separated from Pargana Kheri by the river Ul, and on the north it is 22 miles broad, and separated from pargana Dhaurahra by the river Chauka. At the north-west corner at Pachperi Gh\u00e1t it just touches pargana Nighasan. On the east there is no natural boundary, and here the pargana is only seven miles long from north to south. It is bounded on this side by the pargana of Tambeur in the district of Sitapur.\n\nThe original geographical feature of this pargana is the river Chauka or Sarda, and the history and topography of the pargana would to a great\nextent consist of an account of the numerous changes in the course of this river. At Buseha in Bh\u00fbr, which lies to the north of the village of Srinagar in the pargana of that name, there occurred many years ago a great and important change in the river's course; this has now to be described. Up to about 40 years ago the Chauka seems to have flowed from Buseha to Pachperi, and so on in its present channel, along the frontier of Srinagar and Dhaurahra. In these days a small back water of the river left it at Buseha and passed under Srinagar to the south, and after a winding course of about 12 miles, it was joined by the river Kandwa under the old village of Mahewa, the headquarters of the Mahewa taluqa. Those two villages were large, populous, and prosperous places; both had bazars and temples and mango groves; the former had a large brick fort built at a time when Srinagar gave its name to a taluqa of Muhammadan Bisens, of which it was the headquarters. About forty years ago an unusually heavy rainfall caused the Chauka to rise about Buseha beyond its banks. It swept over into the back water communicating with the Kandwa, rushed up it, and covered the surrounding low country with deep floods over an extent of about 50 square miles. These floods caused widespread ruin; Mahewa and Srinagar and several intervening villages were completely destroyed, and a large tract of country was depopulated and remained for many years a desolate waste.\n\nAfter the autumn rains had ceased, the main body of water continued to flow down the bed of the back water, partially deserting the old channel on the north. The Kandwa, which flowed into the back water at Mahewa, had up to this time given its own name to the united streams from that point, and they had flowed on till they rejoined the Chauka at Rahria, 16 miles east of Mahewa. But from this time the little Kandwa lost its identity by its connexion with its big neighbour, and for the last 16 miles of its course the united stream became known as the Chauka, and by way of distinction I will now call it the southern Chauka. It is generally called the Chauka in this pargana while the name S\u00e2rda is reserved for the more northerly stream. After this for about 30 years the Chauka flowed in two large streams; its own channel to the north and that of the Kandwa or south Chauka to the south, which channels now average about six miles apart. About ten years ago the fickle waters again completely returned into their old bed and left the back water communicating with the Kandwa quite dry.\n\nThus that branch of the river Chauka which I call the southern Chauka does not now carry the waters of the real Chauka in any part of its course. It is merely a continuation of the Kandwa and its tributaries. In the last few years since the back water dried up, the villages of Srinagar and Mahewa and those between them have greatly improved, and will probably in time regain all their former prosperity. Population has been attracted in large numbers in the last few years, but a considerable period must still elapse before the villages in this part of the pargana are once more as well inhabited and cultivated as they used to be.\n\nThe high ridge as marking the southern limit of the river Chauka in pargana Bh\u00fbr has almost disappeared at the point where the river\nenters pargana Srinagar at the village of that name. It appears to cross over to the north side of the river between Buseha and Srinagar, for we find a high and steep bank bounding the Chauka on the north in the villages of Sona Adlabad and Munra Munri in pargana Nighasan, and running off thence into pargana Dhaurahra. There are ridges of varying height along both banks of the southern Chauka throughout the whole of its course, from Srinagar where, though now dry, its waters used to leave the Chauka to Rahria where, conveying the waters of the Kandwa and its tributaries which it has received on its way, it rejoins the Chauka. There is this difference between the ridges on the north and the south bank of the southern Chauka, the ridge on the south bank gradually rises into a still higher tract of country which reaches as far as the river Ul; the ridge on the north bank gradually sinks into a very low plain intersected by ravines and covered with marshes. This plain has an average width of about three miles, and it then rises almost imperceptibly towards the north into another ridge which bounds the southern bank of the Chauka.\n\nThe Chauka seems to resemble deltaic rivers in its formation of these parallel ridges along its sides, the usual course of such rivers is to cast up silt along their sides, thus gradually making the lands through which they flow higher than those somewhat further off. So much for the river Chauka.\n\nThe Ul, which bounds the pargana on the south, is a very different river. It has a low tarai on both sides varying in width from a quarter of a mile to half a mile, and this tarai it overflows in the autumn rains, but never gets beyond it. It is a slow sluggish stream with a small volume of water, an average width of twenty yards, and an average depth of 10 feet. Beyond the tarai the land rises by a gentle ascent into a flat plain of fertile soil, which has an average width of 3 or 4 miles, and bounds the Ul along its whole course in this pargana. In this plain are situated all the 51 villages which have been transferred to this pargana from Kheri, and this tract bears a greater resemblance to pargana Kheri than to the rest of pargana Srinagar.\n\nAfter the Chauka and the Ul the Kandwa remains to be mentioned; this river has been shortly described in the article on pargana Bhur. It enters this pargana at Mitra Bhoji on the west frontier at a distance of three miles from the Ul, and flowing parallel to that river for ten miles, joins the southern Chauka at Mahewa as has been mentioned above.\n\nOn its way it is joined by a little stream called the Kutnaiya on the south, and by the Janai on the north. The Janai enters the Srinagar pargana at Bisaiyapur on the Bhur frontier, and after receiving the waters of the Mihanni and the Kusaiya joins the Kandwa a mile above Mahewa. The tract of country through which flow these small streams gradually converging to one point like the spokes of a wheel is low and marshy and lies on a level intermediate between the high fertile plain along the Ul and the ganjar country bounding the Chauka.\n\nIt is evident then that the geography of the pargana at once suggests the chaks into which it should be divided. First we have the plain along\nthe Ul, just beyond the Ul river plain comes the low marshy tract which is watered by the little Kandwa and its still smaller tributaries, then still further to the north and east are the g\u00e1njar lands along the river Chauka. These naturally constitute two chaks. The one consists of the ridges along the north bank of the southern Chauka and the south bank of the Chauka; the other consists of the low plain between these ridges. In describing these chaks I take the g\u00e1njar country first. An explanation of the name appears necessary, but I am unable to give its etymology. It is applied generally to the low plains lying between the Chauka and the Kauri\u00e1la rivers and stretching away to the foot of the Himalaya range. Inhabitants of the country more to the south apply the term also to the plain between the Ul and the Chauka. But the residents of those parts for instance of Aliganj would repudiate the name. I am told that the word is derived from g\u00e1\u00e9 (a cow) and means the cattle pasturing country. I have said that there is a high ridge along the north bank of the southern Chauka, and another high ridge along the southern bank of the Chauka or S\u00e1rda. This follows the river along its southern bank throughout the whole length of the pargana. During the rains the waters rise and flow off out of the Chauka through various back waters towards the south and south-east; and as the surface of the land rises up towards the ridges along the two rivers, and sinks into a wide low plain at a distance of a few miles from them, the floods discharged by the Chauka through these back waters first inundate the low plain, and then gradually in a very wet season rise up over the ridges to the north and south, and flow over either into the southern Chauka or back again into the S\u00e1rda; the whole of the two g\u00e1njar chaks is therefore more or less liable to inundations, but the waters do not stay so long in the land as they do in the low plains along the river in pargana Bh\u00far.\n\nThe villages are large and contain many small hamlets scattered all over their areas; their sites as in Bh\u00far generally escape the floods; but mango groves are here numerous, and the scattered khair and g\u00falar, i.e., catechu and wild fig trees so abundant in the more northern pargana do not form here a chief feature of the landscape. All over the g\u00e1njar country population has increased greatly during the last ten years, and prosperous fairly cultivated villages now stand in places where ten years ago there was nothing but grass jungle.\n\nThe entire pargana contains an area of 229 square miles divided into 143 villages. Of this area of 146,339 acres 76,962 are cultivated, 49,020 are arable, and 19,120 are barren; the population is 75,840 at the rate of 331 to the square mile; the proprietary rights are mainly divided between the taluqdars of Oel and Mahewa, who acquired possession as a revenue arrangement about thirty-five years before annexation. A few villages belong to the q\u00e1n\u00fange of Kheri.\n\nSUBEHA Pargana\u2014Tahsil Haidargarh\u2014District Bara Banki.\u2014This pargana is bounded on the north by the Gumti, on the east by pargana Jagd\u00edspur of Sultanpur, on the west by pargana Haidargarh, and on the south by pargana Inhauna of Rae Bareli. Its area is 88 square miles or 56,467 acres. Of cultivated land there are 30,783 acres, and of uncultivated\n25,684; the irrigated area is as much as 19,471 acres. In some parts which are cut up by ravines the surface is uneven, but the greater part of the pargana is level. The soil is chiefly loam. The climate is salubrious. The river Gumti flows from west to east on the north border of the pargana; its length here is 24 miles; it skirts 15 villages. Water is met with at from 50 to 60 feet. The chief thoroughfares are the road from Lucknow to Sultanpur, and that from Rae Bareli to Daryabad. There is also a third tract to Rich Gh\u00e1t. There are ferries at 12 places on the Gumti. There are no manufactures except that of country cloth. Schools are at Subeha, Bhatw\u00e1ra, Gr\u00e1nw\u00e1n, Kursia, Pachori, and Muhammadpur. There are post and registry offices at Subeha. The Government revenue amounts to Rs. 66,105. The tenure is as follows:\n\n| Taluqdar\u00ed | Zamindari | Pattidari |\n|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n|           |           |           |\n|           |           |           |\n\nThe population is 52,510. In Subeha there is a shrine of Sh\u00e1dman Shah\u00edd where a fair is held every Jeth (May); the gathering is exclusively local. Subeha and Chaubisi are villages possessing more than 2,000 inhabitants.\n\nThis has been known as a pargana since Akbar's time. The Bhars were the former owners of the soil, but the Musalmans drove them away about 900 years ago under Masa\u00fad who was killed at Bahraich; in later times the Bais obtained possession. The taluqdars of the pargana are Chaudhri Murtaza Husen and Bech-un-nisa.\n\n**SUBEHA\u2014Pargana**\n\n**SUBEHA\u2014Tahsil**\n\n**HAIDARGARH\u2014District**\n\n**BARA BANKI.**\u2014This town lies in latitude 26\u00b0 38' north, longitude 81\u00b0 34' east, 52 miles north-west of Sultanpur, and 30 miles east of Bara Banki near the river Gumti. The tahsil station of Haidargarh is 10 miles to the south-west. There are good many tanks and masonry wells, but most of the former are so shallow that in the rainy season the water overflows them. Depth of wells is from 50 to 60 feet. There is a market held here on Mondays and Thursdays.* Country cloth is the only manufacture. There is a school for teaching Urdu, Persian, and N\u00e1gri, also a police post and a registry office. The population is 2,754, and the number of houses is 691.\n\nThe origin of the name and the date of foundation of the town are lost in obscurity. It is supposed to have been in the dominions of the Bhars prior to the invasion by Sayyad S\u00e1l\u00e1r. The Moslems then seized it, and they form a large portion of the inhabitants still. The principal inhabitant, the late Chaudhri Sarfar\u00e1z Ahmad, was a large landed proprietor; his ancestors, Khw\u00e1ja Bahr\u00e1m and Khw\u00e1ja Niz\u00e1m, are alleged to have accompanied Sayyad S\u00e1l\u00e1r and settled here.\n\nBut the family was obscure till 1033 A.H. (A.D. 1616), when Shekh N\u00e1sir was appointed chaudhri of the pargana Subeha by the Emperor Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n. His descendants divided the pargana amongst themselves, but the office of chaudhri remained undivided, and in 1209 (A.D. 1792), Chaudhri Im\u00e1m Bakhsh commenced to absorb all the separate properties into his own\nestate. Chaudhri Sarfar\u00e1z Ahmad continued this career of aggrandizement; he acquired the Bhilwal estate also in this district, and was granted another near Simrauta in Rae Bareli as a reward for his exertions after the mutiny. His successors are Murtaza Husen and his widow Bech-un-nisa. A fort was built here by Mirza Quli, Chakladar, in the reign of \u00c1sif-ud-daula, and a tahsildar was stationed here till 1227 (A.D. 1810). The late owner of the property built a good brick house, and laid out a garden on the banks of the Gumti.\n\n**SUD\u00c1M\u00c1NPUR\u2014Pargana Dalmau\u2014Tahsil Lalganj\u2014District Rae Bareli**\u2014This village is situated two miles north of the Ganges; it is so called after Sud\u00e1m\u00e1n Singh, its founder, a Janw\u00e1r Chhattiri, who came here about 500 years ago. It is situated in rather low ground which receives the drainage of a large area and is greatly cut up by ravines. The ground rises gradually, and the skirts of the village are buried in groves. The population is 2,140. There is a temple and fair in honour of Kakoran, a Bhar hero, killed by Musalmans, referred to in Dalmau pargana article.\n\n**SUKHETA river\u2014District Kheri**\u2014Has its source in the Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur district in latitude 27\u00b0 55' north longitude 80\u00b0 7' east, forming the boundary between Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur and Kheri. It flows in a south-easterly direction for about 20 miles from its source; it then runs about 2 miles east by north, and finally turning in a south-westerly direction, enters into the Hardoi district about 23 miles from its source in latitude 27\u00b0 39' north, longitude 80\u00b0 13' east. Following the same direction it flows into the Garra in latitude 27\u00b0 18' north; longitude 80\u00b0 2' east. Its total length may be estimated at about 84 miles. It is a torrent in the rains, and cuts off communication with Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur.\nSULTANPUR DISTRICT ARTICLE.*\n\nABSTRACT OF CHAPTERS.\n\nI.\u2014Physical features.

The district as at present constituted differs entirely from that which existed prior to 1869. It will appear that there were formerly twelve parganas in Sultanpur, of these seven remained in the new district which also received four\u2014Isauli, Sultanpur Baraunsa, Aldemasu, and Surharpur\u2020 from Fyzabad. Of the five remaining one (Subeha) went to Bara Banki, and the four others\u2014Inhauna, Rokha Jais, Simrauta, and Mohanganj\u2014to Rae Bareli.\n\nThe area of the district, however, was little altered, and the population only rose from 930,000 to 996,000. The object was to render the district more compactly arranged round the headquarters and to secure easier means of access to the courts and authorities for all the inhabitants. This object was achieved at considerable cost, and the confusion of statistics so caused has not yet been cleared up.\n\nThe old district.\n\n| Tahsil | Pargana | Number of manzas or townships | Total area in British statute miles | Remarks |\n|--------|---------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|---------|\n| Inhauna | Inhauna | ... | 77 | 100 |\n|         | Jagdispur | ... | 156 | 154 |\n|         | Subeha | ... | 86 | 88 |\n|         | Total | ... | 339 | 348 |\n| Mohanganj | Rokha Jais | ... | 110 | 154 |\n|         | Simrauta | ... | 73 | 97 |\n|         | Gaura Jamun | ... | 91 | 93 |\n|         | Mohanganj | ... | 75 | 80 |\n|         | Total | ... | 349 | 434 |\n\n* Most of the information contained in this article is taken from the settlement report.\n\u2020 Part only of the old Surharpur pargana was transferred to Sultanpur; there are thus two parganas of this name\u2014one in this and the other in the Fyzabad district.\nThe old district\u2014(concluded.)\n\n| Tahsil | Pargana | Number of mauzas or townships | Total area in British statute miles | Remarks |\n|--------|---------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------|---------|\n| Amethi | ...     | ...                           | ...                                |         |\n|        | Amethi  | ...                           | 864                                | 299     |\n|        | Isauli  | ...                           | 85                                 | 61      |\n|        | Tappa Aal | ...                         | 97                                 | 67      |\n|        | Total   | ...                           | 546                                | 427     |\n| Sultanpur | ...    | ...                           | ...                                |         |\n|        | Sultanpur | ...                         | 299                                | 246     |\n|        | Chanda  | ...                           | 290                                | 130     |\n|        | Total   | ...                           | 689                                | 376     |\n| District Total | ... | 1,918                        | 1,569                              |         |\n\nThe additions to the district then comprise the trans-Gumti parganas of Isauli, Sultanpur Baraunsa, Aldemau, and Surharpur; a description of them is given under the respective headings, and for an account of the old district of Sultanpur, which still constitutes the main portion of the new one, the settlement officer may be consulted. The present district lies between 81\u00b036' and 82\u00b043' east longitude, and between 26\u00b03' and 26\u00b038' north latitude. Its extreme length is above 80 miles; its extreme breadth about 36.\n\nSlope and watershed.\u2014With the exception of a gradual and scarcely perceptible slope from north-west to south-east, its surface is generally level, being broken only by ravines by which its drainage is effected. Its watershed is identical with that of the Gumti and Sai rivers, starting from a point nine miles west of Haidargarh in the Bara Banki district; it passes a little to the south of Jais and Sultanpur; its altitude above mean sea level being there 351 and 352 feet respectively, and thence onward to Daudpur some miles east of Partabgarh.\n\nGeneral appearance.\u2014The various parts of the district present by no means a uniform aspect; the scenery of many spots on the Gumti is exceedingly pretty, but its immediate neighbourhood is for the most part a black and ravine cut tract, the dreariness of which is sometimes relieved only by mango groves and single trees, and sometimes even these are wanting. The road from Lucknow to Jaunpur again traverses nearly throughout its entire length in this district; highly cultivated and well wooded villages, rich in landscapes as picturesque and varied as a level country can display, while in strong contrast with this fertile range there lies on the extreme south a broad belt of rice land which, interspersed with large arid plains and swampy jhils and marshes, possesses the dismal and uninteresting character peculiar to such vicinities.\nRivers and streams.\u2014Not a single river, unless rain-streams be dignified with the name, intersect the interior of the district. It is traversed however for a considerable distance by the Gumti. The Gumti takes its rise from the Fuljar T\u00e1l in an alluvial tract between the rivers Deoli or Garra and Gogra in the district of Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur; it has a mean south-easterly direction, but its course is often extremely sinuous, a feature from which its name is sometimes with questionable accuracy supposed to have arisen.* It first touches this district on the west, and then flows along its entire north-eastern border at the opposite extremity of which it enters the district of Jaunpur. Within these limits its bed is generally regular, and consists of a superficial stratum of clay overlying an inferior one of sand. The former is usually about five or six feet in depth; the latter is more uneven; in some places it is of immense thickness, in others it has been penetrated and found to rest on a second kankar-dotted formation of clay of yet unascertained dimensions. In some places, however, the regularity of the bed is broken by large and curious kankar reefs, the most remarkable of which is in the vicinity of the civil station, where it nearly hinders the passage of the river.\n\nThe water of the Gumti is sweet and wholesome but not always clear, often being after rain has fallen of a muddy yellow colour, probably attributable to the nature of its bed. Its banks differ greatly from each other, the high bank is generally lofty and abrupt, pierced here and there by ravines hollowed out by the scour of rain floods; though in some places strips of low lying land intervene between the ordinary stream of the river and the high level, the left bank is low, and the land behind it, on the Fyzabad side, ascends by a very gentle and gradual incline. Its affluents individually insignificant are numerically important, and fed by them its stream is liable to great and sudden changes. The degree to which it may be affected by this cause in the rainy season will be seen from the following particulars:\n\nFrom November to June its ordinary breadth is under 200 and its depth about 12 or 13 feet, its velocity being then about two miles an hour, and its volume about 5,000 cubic feet: in the heavy floods of last September it attained a depth of 48 feet, its velocity increasing to close upon four miles an hour, and its volume, where it flowed through the embankments of the new pile bridge at Sultanpur, to more than 100,000 cubic feet; all this time, moreover, an escape was open to it in the inundation of the low lands on its left bank for a distance of a mile or more.\n\n* If this derivation were accurate, the name should be \"Gh\u00famti.\" The absence of the h might perhaps be explained by the extremely evanescent nature of that letter, but the correct Sanskrit name is well known, and is not \"Gh\u00famti\" but \"Gomati.\" The Gomti is mentioned in the Vishnu Puran under its Sanskrit name (Asiatic Society's Journal, I., 10, 1865). It is also referred to in the following passage of the \"Jama-ut-taw\u00e1r\u00edch\" (A.D. 1310):\u2014\"Afterwards the waters of the Gang\u00e1, the Rah\u00e1b, the Kuh\u00ed, and the Sarju unite near the city of B\u00e1r\u00ed.\" For General Cunningham says that the Kuh\u00ed is undoubtedly the Gomti, the union of the Sarju with the Gomti being a fable (Elliott's History of India, Vol. I., 49-50). Later Muhammadan writers, e.g., B\u00e1bar and Abul Fazi, call it Kod\u00ed or God\u00ed. In the \"T\u00e1rih-i-Farishta it is called Kawah (Elliott, III., 307).\"\nOf rain-streams the most important are the K\u00e1ndu, the P\u00edli, the Tengha, the Nandhia. The K\u00e1ndu takes its rise in a morass in the village of R\u00e1epur, pargana Simrauta, and in the upper or western portion of its course skirts the Inhauna pargana, being there a shallow stream known by the name of Naiya. Further on, near Jagdispur, it becomes a small river with rugged banks, and is then called the K\u00e1ndu, under this name it proceeds onward to the Gumti with which it ultimately unites itself, forming during the last portion of its course the boundary between the Isauli and Jagdispur parganas. The Pili nadi becomes in the rains a considerable stream, but at other times consists of a string of disconnected jh\u00edls and swamps. Their ramifications cover a great portion of the south of Ch\u00e1nda, but where they commence it is impossible to say\u2014not apparently anywhere in this district. They appear rather to belong to a vast system, and to be continuous with other similar ones in Rae Bareli, the connection being maintained by those in the Amethi and Mohanganj parganas. The Tengha is so called from a village of the same name in pargana Amethi, where it is spanned by an old masonry bridge erected about half a century ago by M\u00edr Ghul\u00e1m Husen, the N\u00e1zim of the period. In the first portion of its course it consists of two branches, the village of Sukulpur being the point of bifurcation after flowing south-east for a distance of five miles from that village, it crosses the borders of the Partabgarh district, and falls eventually into the Chamrauri, a tributary of the Sai. The Nandhia nadi first appears in the village of that name in pargana Tappa Asl; for some way it holds a course parallel to one of the branches of the Tengha, but ultimately unites with the main body of that stream, at the point where it discharges itself into the Chamrauri. Both the Tengha, and the Nandhia are streams of some consequence as their channels are deep though narrow, and form the outlet for the superfluous waters of extensive series of jh\u00edls.\n\nLakes.\u2014One of these series known as jh\u00edl Lodhai commences in the village of Bhalg\u00e1on and stretches through Go\u00e1w\u00e1n to Nar\u00e1in, a distance of thirteen miles, where the lacustrine formation ceases, and is succeeded by one of the branches of the Tengha. A second series is composed principally of the \"R\u00e1ja's B\u00e1ndh,\" a dam of great magnitude in the village of Katra R\u00e1ni, thrown up between twenty and thirty years ago by R\u00e1ja Bisheeshwar Singh of Amethi, the name, though strictly speaking it refers to the dam itself, is commonly given to a vast sheet of water several miles in length, the collection of which is in great measure due to it. Below the B\u00e1ndh the line of jh\u00edls is resumed, and goes on until it gives place to the second branch of the Tengha. This branch is naturally of less importance than it formerly was owing to the interception of so much water by the R\u00e1ja's B\u00e1ndh, but it proved useful when that embankment burst two years ago in carrying off the tremendous quantity of water which was then set free, and which for a time caused a partial inundation of some of the adjacent villages. The jh\u00edls connected with the Nandhia nadi may be traced back from the head of that stream to the village of Bis\u00e1ra in the Isauli pargana; from the latter as far as Dhamaur it is called Jh\u00edl Naiya, the remaining portion of it being known as B\u00e1ndh Bujhwa.\nNatural productions: vegetable.\u2014Of woods and forests though none now remain, tradition tells of the existence within the last sixty years. One large tract of dense jungle, it is said, extended in an unbroken stretch from the residence of the R\u00e1ja of Amethi quite up to the provincial road to Lucknow, and the Bhadaiy\u00e1n jungle, also, which even after the mutiny covered more than a thousand acres, is said to have been the remains of an extensive wood, patches of which are still to be found in villages far removed from Bhadaiy\u00e1n. The only tree-covered tracts of spontaneous growth at the present day are dh\u00e1k jungles. These, however, cannot be called forests of which they lack the stateliness and density; seen in the twilight at the season of the year their leaves are gathered for fuel, their crooked trunks and branches present the appearance of a number of gaunt weird figures in all sorts of grotesque and fantastic attitudes. The absence of forest scarcely furnishes matter for regret. If they have come under the axe, it is because it is more profitable to cultivate the land they occupied; and a satisfactory substitute for them, devoid of their unhealthiness, is to be found in the large and noble groves with which the district is plentifully studded. Two or three well known single groves are over fifteen acres in extent, and elsewhere separately planted ones combine to fill an area of more than half that size. The trees most in favour for groves are the mango, the j\u00e1mun, and the mahua, interspersed now and then, especially near village sites, with an \u00f1oula, g\u00falar, or kathal; the mahua is also often found alone or in clumps of two or three in open spots, as are the bel, the kaitha, and the nfm. Grand old solitary trees of immense magnitude, the banyan, the p\u00e1kar and the p\u00edpal, planted perhaps in the days of Bhar supremacy, here and there form a prominent feature in a village landscape; and the cotton tree and the dh\u00e1k are at one season of the year rendered conspicuous for a long distance round by the brilliancy of their profuse and gaudy blossoms. The tamarind and the palm which affect damp and feverish localities are comparatively rare in the district; such as there are lie principally near old Muhammadan qasbas. The bab\u00fal is common everywhere. The sissoo and the tun, though they seem to thrive with very moderate care, are only found in the civil station and in road-side avenues planted from nurseries at that place. The asok, the teak, and the Millingtonia are of recent introduction, and must, with regard to this district, be at present considered garden trees. A teak raised from seed sown a few years ago is now eighteen feet in height, and has a fine straight stem, with a girth at its thickest part of eighteen inches. It is already valuable for its handsome foliage, but, as it takes from sixty to eighty years to come to maturity, it will be time enough two or three generations hence to base an opinion on it as to whether trees of its class could be profitably grown in this climate for their timber.\n\nOf horticultural produce a great variety is to be found in the public gardens at Sultanpur, and also in many private ones. Most sorts of European vegetables will thrive in the cold season, though fresh seed requires to be imported annually for them; the cabbage, cauliflower, beet-root, carrot, and tomato reach great perfection; the artichoke, asparagus, and celery, the pea and various sorts of beans, though inferior to the former, are still of a very fair quality; broccoli and Brussels sprouts have been found to succeed\nbut are not commonly grown; lettuces and cress last during the greater portion of the year. The vine and the strawberry have been cultivated with considerable success, the pine apple grows, but has never yet borne fruit, whether it is capable of being made to do so is, I think, an open question. There are lechi, apple, and pear trees in the Sultanpur gardens, but their fruit is of little value. The orange, lemon, guava, and custard apple, the peach, pomegranate, the plantain, and the kamrak are more common. They are to be met with in private gardens all over the district, into which, indeed, many kinds\u2014not only of fruit, but of vegetables also\u2014have already found their way. It is probable that with these examples of the possibility of successful cultivation before their eyes, the more skilful agricultural castes will soon venture to make the experiment of field cultivation with many of the more hardy vegetables. The potato is already ceasing to be uncommon. I have seen enclosed fields of it in Mohanganj, Chanda, and Isauli. Some classes, however, are said to have a prejudice against it.\n\nMinerals.\u2014Kankar, a carbonate of lime, containing silica and oxide of iron, is the only mineral production of the district, in nearly every part of which it is found in great abundance. It lies at a distance of from a few inches to 3 or 4 feet from the surface, in a stratum of about the same thickness. It is of four sorts\u2014bichua, black in appearance, and a first rate road metal; mathia, a lighter softer kind, with which a quantity of clay or earth is always intermixed; pathria, a sandy stony metal, and chatan, a hardy yellow metal good for roads, which neither mathia nor pathria is. The kankar reefs of the Gunti have been already mentioned; some of these contain a fossil formation of a yellow colour from which excellent lime is to be obtained. A bed about five acres in extent, and about four feet from the surface of Multani-matti or Armenian bolic, an earth used for dyeing purposes, which has been recently found in pargana Chanda, may perhaps be worthy of notice.\n\nAnimals.\u2014Very few wild animals infest the district, and even those, with the exception of wolves, are rather mischievous than dangerous. Wolves haunt the neighbourhood of ravines; nil-gae are found in a few of the denser jungle tracts; wild pigs are comparatively scarce, sugarcane fields, furnishing at once both food and shelter, are their favourite resort, \"the wild hog's reedy home;\" jackals are ubiquitous; monkeys are not numerous, but where they do take up their abode, commit sad depredations on the crops. It is worthy of remark that deer and antelope, so common in other portions of the province, have no place whatever in the zoology of this district.\n\nGame of various sorts\u2014the hare, wild goose, partridge, quail, and wild ducks being the most common\u2014is plentiful in the cold weather; fish is found in large quantities both in the river and in large tanks and jhils. The mullet and the rohu are held in most esteem; the former, which is particularly fine, is confined to the Gunti; the latter is more general.\n\nOf useful animals there are few indigenous breeds, and what there are, miserably poor. The horse is altogether wanting; the nearest approach to it is the ordinary wretched pony of the country; the standard of excellence\nof horned cattle, the buffalo excepted, is similarly low; the supply of\nthe better sort of these animals is kept up by importation. Horses may\noften be purchased of itinerant dealers who pay occasional visits to most\ntowns of any consequence; but the husbandman who wishes to renew his\nteam of oxen generally prefers to undertake a journey to one of the great\ncattle dep\u00f4ts and there make his own selection. N\u00e1npira, Dhaurahra, and\nKhairigarh are the places he most commonly resorts to.\n\n\"There are three descriptions of produce,\" says a French writer,* \"which\nman may demand from cattle besides the manure, the hide, and the offal,\nnamely, their labour, their milk, and their flesh. Of these three the least\nprofitable is the first...........\" The French agriculturist requires labour from\nhis cattle in preference to everything else; the British agriculturist looks\nchiefly to the milk and the meat; the Indian agriculturist, different from\nboth, contents himself with the labour of the ox and the milk of the cow;\nit is only where non-Hindu communities reside that the flesh of those\nanimals becomes a source of profit. Their hides indeed, in the first place,\nsupply all local wants, and any surplus there may be is carried to some\nneighbouring bazar, to be thence forwarded directly or indirectly to\nCalcutta or Bombay, and forms an infinitesimal quota of the immense num-\nber annually exported from those places. The labour demanded from the\nox is to carry the packsaddle and draw the cart and plough.\n\nOf sheep and goats large flocks are often kept with the principal object\nof obtaining the valuable manure they afford. When used for this pur-\npose they are folded on the land the manure is required for, and the\nowner receives his remuneration in kind; a goat or sheep being thought\na fair return for the loan of the flock for a night. The goat is further\nuseful for its milk and the sheep for its wool, which is manufactured into\ncoarse blankets for the wear of the village population. Both of these\nanimals are slaughtered to a limited extent for food. The indulgence is\nsometimes, indeed, restricted to festival occasions, and even then is invested\nwith a sacrificial character; but if it is not more common, it arises as\nmuch from the comparative expensiveness of the diet as from the vegeta-\nrian propensities of the Hindus.\n\nClimate\u2014The climate, judged by a tropical or sub-tropical standard, is\nmild, temperate, and healthy. From October to June westerly winds\nprevail, and during the first four of those months are dry, cold, and bracing,\nmore particularly after rain, of which there is almost invariably a slight\nfall about Christmas. Towards the end of February they begin to increase\nin force, their temperature becoming higher, and by the end of March, if\nnot earlier, the hot winds usually set in. These, however, are much less\ntrying than they are in many places further to the west. They do not\nbegin for some hours after day-break, and seldom last long after dark,\nwhile they occasionally cease for several days together. In these intervals,\nwhich become more and more frequent as the hot weather progresses, a\nnorth-east wind takes its place. About the middle of June the rainy season\ncommences, and with occasional breaks of greater or less duration conti-\nnues till the end of September or beginning of October; sometimes, but\n\n* Rural Economy of England, 31.\nnot often, lasting till the middle of the latter month; the wind during this period scarcely ever leaves the east.\n\nThe following statement exhibits the rainfall for eleven years*:\n\n| Year | Inches | Tenths |\n|------|--------|--------|\n| 1865 | ...    | 29     |\n| 1866 | ...    | 32     |\n| 1867 | ...    | 42     |\n| 1868 | ...    | 36     |\n| 1869 | ...    | 43     |\n| 1870 | ...    | 58     |\n| 1871 | ...    | 66     |\n| 1872 | ...    | 40     |\n| 1873 | ...    | 32     |\n| 1874 | ...    | 46     |\n| 1875 | ...    | 39     |\n\nAverage for eleven years: ... 41 5\n\nThe rainfall up to date\u2014September 5th, 1877\u2014has been from June 1st 10' 7\".

These amounted only to 1'7 inches\u2014not sufficient to moisten the earth for the plough and to water the early rice.\n\n* This is for the whole district. The figures given subsequently are from observations taken at the Sultanpur dispensary only, hence the difference.\nSecond.\u2014The main monsoon which commences in July and ends at the commencement of October. This was sufficient in both years, but the fall in September, 1873, was only 3'7 inches, and it ceased too soon, viz., on September 15th.\n\nThirdly.\u2014The latter or October rains, which are required to water the late rice and moisten the land for the winter ploughings, were wholly deficient in both years.\n\nFourth.\u2014The January-February rains, which were wholly wanting in 1869 and in 1874, were under an inch.\n\nSpeaking broadly then the rains commenced well in 1868, badly in 1873; they ended with a fair fall in 1868, but too soon; in 1873 they were scanty for the last month, and ended still earlier in September.\n\nSo far 1873 was much worse than 1868, then there was absolutely no rain in either year from October till January.\n\nBut in February there was no rain in 1869, and about an inch in 1874.\n\n|                  | 1868 | 1872 |\n|------------------|------|------|\n| Rainfall from June 1st to October 1st | 25\u00b74 | 36\u00b71 |\n| From October 1st to December 31st     | 0\u00b70  | 0\u00b72  |\n| In June ... ... ...                   | 3\u00b75  | 1\u00b77  |\n| In September ... ...                 | 4\u00b77  | 8\u00b79  |\n| In October ... ...                   | 0\u00b70  | 0\u00b70  |\n| Date of rain commencing              | June 16th | June 18th |\n| ... of rain ending                   | September 21st | September 16th |\n| Rain in January February of ensuing year | 0\u00b70  | 0\u00b79  |\n\nThe following memorandum on medical aspects was furnished by the Civil Surgeon, Dr. A. Cameron:\n\nVital statistics.\u2014There is no registration of births carried on at present in this district. Birth statistics appear to have been collected in 1869 and 1870, but their collection was discontinued in the latter year.\nThe registration of deaths has been attempted during the last 5 or 6 years, but hitherto the numbers registered have been very far below the truth. The numbers for the last four years were\u2014\n\n| Year | Registered deaths per 1,000 of population |\n|------|------------------------------------------|\n| 1870 | 15-3                                     |\n| 1871 | 18-35                                    |\n| 1872 | 7-83                                     |\n| 1873 | 5-5                                      |\n\nIt is needless to say that these are altogether impossible figures representing an average duration of life of somewhere between 55 and 180 years.\n\nThe agency at present employed for the collection of these statistics is that of the village chaukidars who are called upon to report the deaths that take place in their villages once a month, or oftener in epidemic seasons, at the police stations. It was hoped when this agency was adopted in 1870, that it would yield better results than the one previously employed, and for some time the number of deaths registered was considerably higher than it had been, but the returns of the last two years show that the improvement was only temporary.\n\nEndemic diseases.\u2014The principal endemic diseases of the district are fevers, of which the prevailing types are intermittent and remittent. Continued fevers are also met with, but they bear a small proportion to the periodic, and appear to be merely aggravated cases of intermittent or remittent, and without any specific character of their own. Fever, pure and simple as it is met with in this district, is, in fact, altogether of the \"malarious\" kind.\n\nOf 2,000 cases of fever treated at the Sultanpur Dispensary the proportion of quotidian agues was said to be 4ths, of tertian about 1/4, of quartans about 1/4th, and of remittents about 1/7th. None were entered as \"continued,\" but it is probable that some of the remittents would more properly have been so named. In severe cases the remission is often very slight or not at all perceptible.\n\nIt is impossible to say precisely to what extent fever prevails amongst the general population. Amongst the prisoners in the Sultanpur Jail the average annual number of attacks during the four years, from 1870 to 1873, was 13 per cent. of average strength, and amongst the Sultanpur police during the same period it was about 15 per cent. Assuming that the general population suffered in an equal degree, and making allowance for repeated attacks in the same individual, it is no extravagant estimate to assume that at least 10 per cent. of the population suffers every year from fever.\n\nNo trustworthy statistics with regard to the death-rate from fever can be given. The mortuary returns, as already stated, are unreliable, and the mortality amongst the police and the prisoners is no criterion, as it is affected by the treatment the patients receive. Considering the great preponderance of the comparatively non-fatal intermittent type it is\nprobable that the mortality is nothing like what it is represented to be in the mortuary returns, where it appears as the cause of more than half the deaths in the district.\n\nThe great causes of the fever that prevails in the district appear to be the defective drainage and the annual saturation of the soil by the rains. The surface is so flat and the natural drains so few that surface water cannot find a ready escape. It accumulates wherever there is a hollow in the surface, forming stagnant pools, or sinks into the ground raising the subsoil water level. In many places this rises in the rains to within a foot or two of the surface. In this way the soil becomes waterlogged, except in the immediate vicinity of the water courses, and the immediate result is an outbreak of fever. The period of the year from July to November being that during which the ground is thus saturated is the season in which fever is most prevalent. Its severity appears to be proportionate to the rainfall; the greater the fall the more prevalent the fever. The amount of fever depends also on the manner of the rainfall. When the showers are moderate and occur at intervals the water escapes by percolation into the soil or by evaporation, and the resulting fever is proportionally moderate, but when the rain falls in heavy bursts, lasting for days together as it sometimes does, the soil becomes completely waterlogged, extensive tracts of land are flooded, and fever breaks out with great severity. The rainy season of 1871 was marked by heavy floods in September, and as a consequence of this the number of deaths reported from fever during that and the three following months was very great, more than the whole numbers set down to the same cause in 1872 when rain fell more equally and at greater intervals.\n\nIn proportion as the surface-water dries up and the subsoil water level sinks, the fever diminishes until it reaches a minimum in the dry hot season.\n\nThe cultivation of rice, which is extensively grown during the rains, must greatly assist in the production of fever by obstructing the surface drainage, and the decay of the rank vegetation which springs up during the rains may also have an effect in producing fever. The latter cause cannot, however, be a very powerful one as cultivation is general throughout the district, and jungly tracts are few and of limited extent; at the same time many marshy places are covered with a kind of long coarse weedy grass and other weeds, which in process of rotting and drying up under the hot sun may give forth malaria.\n\nPerhaps the alluvial nature of the soil itself may have much to do with the prevalence of malarious fevers.\n\nIt is impossible to say in the absence of reliable statistics whether increased cultivation has had any effect in lessening the prevalence of fever of late years.\n\nConservancy has as yet made but little progress, being almost entirely confined to the small town of Sultanpur itself, and its effect in diminishing the prevalence of fever has yet to be tried. The clearing away of rank vegetation from within and around villages, and the protection\nof the drinking water from pollution, would no doubt do much good. The great want of the country, however, in relation to fever is drainage, and until some improvement is made in this, there is not likely to be much diminution in the prevalence of fever.\n\n**Bowel complaints.**\u2014The most important of the endemic diseases after fever are dysentery and diarrhoea. According to the mortuary returns the annual number of deaths from \"bowel complaints,\" which are probably chiefly dysentery and diarrhoea, is from $\\frac{1}{15}$th to $\\frac{1}{30}$th of the whole mortality. It is impossible to say how near this is to the truth. Comparison with jail mortality would not be proper, as prisoners are placed under very different hygienic conditions from the free population, and these must greatly influence the mortality from bowel complaints. The police, again, receive careful medical treatment.\n\nThe number of attacks amongst the police may, however, be taken as a measure of the extent to which these diseases prevail amongst the general population. During the last four years the police have been attacked with dysentery at the rate of 2\u00b73 per cent. per annum, and with diarrhoea at the rate of 1\u00b73 per cent. per annum. It is, for many reasons, probable that the general population suffered more than this, and, for them, 5 per cent. for both diseases together would not be an excessive estimate.\n\nThe end of the rainy season and the beginning of the cold weather is the period when bowel complaints are most prevalent. The dry hot season is the period when they are least so.\n\nThe fact that dysentery and diarrhoea prevail most at the same time of the year that fever is most common points to a common cause, and it seems probable that dysentery, at all events, is of malarial origin. There are many circumstances, however, in the ordinary life of the poorer classes of natives which render them peculiarly liable to bowel complaints. These are chiefly the exposure of the abdomen, which the native dress but scantily covers, to sudden chills, the drinking of impure water, about which the average native is not particular, and the eating of green vegetables and unripe fruits in inordinate quantities whenever procurable. In times of scarcity, too, the poorest classes are reduced to the necessity of supporting life on poor and unwholesome grains. Jail experience teaches also that a native whose strength has been reduced by fever and old people generally, are exceedingly liable to attacks of dysentery and diarrhoea, and the most careful attention to diet is necessary to ward these off. In their own homes, where no such intelligent care is taken of them, their almost superstitious attachment to their \"roti\" (bread), or their inability to obtain food suitable to their condition, must, under these circumstances, often prove fatal to them.\n\n**Leprosy.**\u2014Leprosy is a common disease in the district, and there are probably few villages of any size which do not contain some victims of this frightful malady. The number of lepers was estimated in the census report of 1869 at 651 or '06 per cent. of the population, but the writer cannot help thinking that the disease is much more common than this represents it to be.\nIt appears to affect chiefly the lower classes, but it is by no means confined to them. Its cause is quite unknown. Most probably it is some local condition connected with the food of the people. The consumption of arhar d\u00e1l has been suggested as a cause, but this, like many other conjectures regarding leprosy, seems to rest on very insufficient grounds. The disease appears to be, in many cases, hereditary.\n\nGoitre.\u2014Goitre is almost unknown in the district. A few cases are to be met with on the border of the Fyzabad district, in some parts of which the disease is common, but the rest of the district is quite free from the disease.\n\nStone.\u2014Stone in the bladder is a not uncommon affection. From 10 to 20 cases are treated every year at the dispensaries, and there are probably many more that never apply there for treatment.\n\nThere is no other important disease of a markedly endemic character in the district excepting perhaps simple cholera which is noticed further on. Amongst less important diseases, however, may be mentioned two very common affections of the skin\u2014the \"dad,\" or dhobies itch and \"senhwa,\" or scurf skin, both of which, if not peculiar to the natives of the country, affect them to a much greater extent than diseases of a similar nature do Europeans.\n\nThe dad is a disease closely resembling ringworm, which attacks the loins, the fork of the thighs, or other moist parts, and often spreads extensively over the surface of the body. It is unpleasant in appearance, but does not appear to cause much inconvenience. It is easily cured by the application of a lime and sulphur lotion, but the subject of it is usually too regardless of it to do anything for it.\n\nThe senhwa is not so common. It attacks the neck, shoulders, and upper part of the body, appearing in small droplike patches which gradually coalesce, are covered with branny scales, and are paler than the surrounding skin. It is identical with the Pityriasis Versicolor of Europe.\n\nIt is curable by the same means as the dad, but not so readily. Both diseases appear to be of parasitic vegetable origin, and their being so common is no doubt due to the native custom of bathing in stagnant and usually filthy water, and dressing afterwards without drying the skin.\n\nEpidemic diseases.\u2014The diseases that prevail in the district in an epidemic form are cholera and small-pox. Measles is probably sometimes present also, but judging from the experience of the last 6 or 7 years, it does not seem ever to become widely epidemic. Indeed, it does not appear at all amongst the names of diseases treated at the dispensaries, and the only reason the writer has for saying that it is probably to be met with is that he has seen the disease in two contiguous districts.\n\nCholera was epidemic in the district in 1869 (the first year for which statistics are forthcoming), 1870, 1871, and 1872; since June, 1872, a period of more than two years, the disease has not appeared in an epidemic form.\n\nThe epidemic of 1869 lasted from June to November, and is represented by the mortuary returns to have caused during that period about 2,000\nThe disease then subsided, but did not altogether disappear, and again assumed epidemic proportions in October, 1870. This outbreak was comparatively mild, the recorded deaths being under 1,000, and the disease again subsided in February, 1871. During the succeeding months it was still present, but was not very fatal till October following, when it broke out again with great virulence, numbering upwards of 5,000 victims in three months.\n\nIn February, 1872, it had again all but disappeared, but once more became epidemic in March, and caused about 2,000 deaths during that and the three following months. In July, 1872, it ceased to be epidemic, and since that time, with the exception of a few sporadic cases occurring chiefly during the warm weather, the disease has entirely disappeared.\n\nThe above brief account contains almost all that can be told of epidemic cholera in this district. Nothing positive seems to have been ascertained regarding the mode in which the disease was introduced, if it was introduced from without, the classes of people chiefly attacked, the proportion of fatal cases, and many other points of interest regarding it. The general impression of the Civil Surgeons who had to do with these epidemics seems to have been that the disease spread through the medium of the drinking water, the general neglect of conservancy in villages, and the pollution of wells and tanks used for drinking purposes, greatly favouring the spread of, if they did not actually produce the disease.\n\nEpidemic cholera is not peculiar to any season as the above account of its latest outbreaks shows, but the rains and the three months immediately following appear to be most favourable to it. As already noticed, this is the period when fever is also most prevalent. The epidemic of 1872, which began in March and lasted till June, may be looked upon as a revival of the severe epidemic of 1871, which for some reason received a check in January and February. Excluding the period of this outbreak, there appears a general coincidence between the season at which fever and cholera most prevail. It is worthy of remark, too, that the great mortality from the latter disease in 1871 was coincident with a very high death rate from fever, the heavy floods of that year appearing equally favourable to both.\n\nThough not epidemic every year, cholera appears to be always present more or less in the hot weather and rains. Looking at the mortuary returns of the last five years, it may in fact be said to be endemic in the district. Not a month passed, from 1868 to September, 1872, without some deaths being reported, and though the disease entirely disappeared during the cold weather of 1872-73, sporadic cases again appeared in each month from April to November following. These sporadic cases are similar to all appearance to those that occur during an epidemic, and whatever may be the difference between the sporadic and the epidemic disease in point of causation, there is none to be detected in the symptoms presented by individual cases. So far as known at present, it is most probable the epidemic disease is either imported by travellers from a distance or spreads from neighbouring districts, and is not a mere occasional aggravation of the endemic disease.\nSmall-pox.\u2014Small-pox unlike cholera is epidemic in the district every year. It is never wholly absent, but during the cold weather the number of deaths is usually small. The epidemic season begins with the dry hot weather and lasts till June. On the setting in of the rains the number of deaths rapidly diminishes till it reaches a minimum about the beginning of the cold weather throughout which the disease remains comparatively inactive to wake again into activity in March. This, with but little variation, is the history of the disease from year to year as shown by the mortuary returns, and these may be accepted as correctly representing, in a general way, the annual course of the disease. The regular recurrence of its outbreaks each hot weather is due, no doubt, partly to the increased temperature, but in greater measure to the free intercourse amongst the people at that period; March, April, and May being the great months for marriages and visits amongst relatives.\n\nThe mortality from small-pox varies according to the returns from 300 or 400 to 1,200 per annum. It is impossible to say how far these variations are due to defective registration, but it is probable the actual mortality does vary considerably, a circumstance somewhat remarkable, seeing that the people remain equally unprotected from year to year, and adopt no precaution against the spread of the disease. This is a phenomenon common to all epidemic diseases, however, and is no more to be explained as regards small-pox than other diseases of the same class.\n\nThe proportion of deaths to attacks cannot be precisely ascertained. It is probably not very high, judging from the fact that at least 90 per cent. of the population are attacked with small-pox before they reach adult age. So common is the disease that it is looked upon as inevitable that every one should have the disease at least once in his life, and the sooner the better after infancy. The people do not, however, attempt to anticipate the natural course of things by practising inoculation; this does not appear to be anywhere practised throughout the district.\n\nA few vaccinators have been employed by Government during the last 3 or 4 years, but the efforts of these have very properly been concentrated chiefly on the small town of Sultanpur itself and its neighbourhood, and the offer of vaccination has not as yet been extended to the great mass of the people. Judging from the small progress the prophylactic has made in the esteem of the small section of the people which has been offered it, it will be long before small-pox ceases to be one of the chief scourges of the district.\n\nCattle epidemics.\u2014The principal epidemic disease that prevails amongst cattle in the district is rinderpest. It is the only one alluded to in the district sanitary report, and though foot and mouth disease is said to be also prevalent, there is no definite information regarding it, and it is probable many cases of so-called foot and mouth disease are really cases of rinderpest, the ulceration of the mouth attending the latter disease giving rise to the mistake.\n\nThe symptoms of rinderpest as observed in the district are those usually ascribed to the disease. They are briefly fever, bloody purging,\nand ulceration of the mouth, with occasionally a pustular eruption on the skin. On examination after death the bowels are found to be congested and ulcerated, and this is all that is usually observed.\n\nThe disease would seem to be always more or less prevalent in the district, and to have its seasons of dormancy and activity like small-pox in the human being to which it bears some resemblance. It is very fatal; but in the absence of statistics it is impossible to say anything definite regarding either its prevalence or the rate of mortality amongst the animals attacked. It may, however, be stated that it is not nearly so fatal as the same disease in Europe.\n\nNotwithstanding that the disease is so evidently spread by contagion, the owners of cattle do not seem to make any attempt to separate the sick from the healthy. Nor do they, as a rule, attempt any curative measures. The \"stamping out\" of the disease by killing the diseased animals is of course out of the question in a Hindu community, nor would it be justifiable, as a large proportion of the animals recover.\n\nFairs.\u2014There are no large fairs held in this district, and the few local gatherings that take place cannot have much effect in propagating disease, as they do not in any instance last more than a day, and are chiefly attended by the people of the neighbourhood.\n\nIndigenous drugs.\u2014The following is a list of some of the most important of the indigenous medicines found in the district:\n\n| Native name | English or scientific name | Therapeutic action |\n|-------------|---------------------------|--------------------|\n| Adrak       | Ginger                    | Stimulant and carminative. |\n| Afiun       | Opium                     | Sedative, narcotic, &c. |\n| Amilte ka phul | Cassia pulp             | Purgative. |\n| Ananta Muli | Hemidismus Indicus        | Alternative, diaphoretic, diuretic, tonic. |\n| Anar ka jar ka chilka | Pomegranate root bark | Anthelmintic. |\n| Babul ka good | Gum acacia               | Demulcent. |\n| Bel gari    | Bael fruit                | Astringent. |\n| Dhatuva     | Dhatura siba              | Anodyne and antispasmodic. |\n| Imli        | Tamarind fruit            | Laxative and refrigerant. |\n| Indran      | Colocynth (pseudo)        | Purgative. |\n| Kaliadana   | Black seed (pharbitis nil), Ditto. |\n| Madar       | Calotropis                | Alternative diaphoretic emetic. |\n| Namadar     | Sal ammoniac              | Alternative. |\n| Padina      | Mint                      | Carminative. |\n| Shera       | Saltpetre                 | Refrigerant, diuretic, and diaphoretic. |\nNative practitioners.\u2014There are few, if any, native practitioners of repute, either Hindu or Musalman, in the district. The village Baid or Kabiraj possesses at most but a smattering of medical knowledge, though his pharmacopoeia is extensive and varied enough. His system of treatment appears to be founded on the humoural pathology, which ascribes all disease to the derangement of the four humours\u2014blood, bile, mucous, and wind. Disturbance of the normal balance of the humour gives rise to disease, and the curative means employed are directed to restoring the normal balance. This is first attempted by reduction and regulation of diet, the food allowed being of a stimulating or non-stimulating nature, according as the disease is understood to be caused by cold or heat. Should these means fail bloodletting, emetics, or purgatives are employed to expel the peccant humour; the first when the patient is plethoric, the second when the mucous humour is in excess, and the last especially when the bile or wind is in undue abundance. Besides these means they appear to use a great variety of medicines whose chief merit is that they are either cooling or heating in their properties. They also employ tonics largely, both vegetable and mineral.\n\nTheir prescriptions are usually very complicated, and include a large number of substances. The ingredients are sometimes of an extraordinary nature\u2014such articles as gold, silver, pearls, and precious stones being very commonly prescribed.\n\nThere seems in superficial inquiry to be but little difference between the system of the Kabiraj and that of the Hakim, except that the treatment of the former is more stimulant and less exhausting to the patient than that of the Hakim.\n\nThe following is a list of some of the drugs used by them besides those in the list above given:\n\n| Mineral          | Vegetable       |\n|------------------|-----------------|\n| Arsenic          | Atis            |\n| Cinnabar         | Chiretta        |\n| Bichloride of mercury | Nim           |\n| Gold             | Pepper          |\n| Silver           | Rasot           |\n| Sulphate of copper | Aconite      |\n| Antimony         | Lotus root, &c., &c. |\n\nThe natives of the district are of fair average physique, though judged by an English standard they are, taken as a whole, both undersized and deficient in bony and muscular development. Amongst the higher castes there are many tall well built men to be met with, and even amongst the lower castes there are many exceptions to the general rule of inferiority of physique, still the great mass of the population are short in stature compared with Englishmen and greatly inferior in muscle. The difference in the nature of their diet and the scanty way in which the labouring native\nis enabled to feed himself are quite sufficient to account for his inferiority of physique.\n\nAverage temperature.\u2014The average temperature is lowest in January, the mean of that month being about 65\u00b0F. It gradually rises till May, when it ranges from 90\u00b0 to 100\u00b0; on the setting in of the rains the mean temperature comes down to about 85\u00b0, and remains about that height till October, when it begins gradually to decrease, reaching its minimum again in January.\n\nThere are no severe frosts, but cold blighting winds are not unfrequent in December and January. There are also occasional hailstorms about March and April, which sometimes do great damage to crops.\nCHAPTER II.\n\nAGRICULTURE AND COMMERCE.\n\nCrop area\u2014Irrigation\u2014Food of the people\u2014Fish\u2014Prices\u2014Traffic\u2014Exports and imports\u2014Manufactures\u2014Communications.\n\nCrop area.\u2014The following table shows the crop area in detail as derived from the settlement records for the old district of Sultanpur. This is probably correct with the important exception that dufasli crops (the area bearing two crops) are not entered.\n\nThe entire area under cultivation was 505,520* acres, the detailed crops in the accompanying table only account for 488,423 acres; this will leave 17,000 acres or 3\u00bd per cent. for fallow\u2014a fair percentage; and the remainder will be the area under cultivation cropped once, but about 20 per cent. of the land is cropped twice, so that the crop area really should be about 600,000 acres.\n\nThe present area of cultivation is 890 square miles or 509,600\u2020 acres, so the changes of boundary have practically not affected the area under cultivation.\n\nIn order to correct the settlement return a considerable area should be added to the kharif crops; this return was prepared in the cold weather, the cold weather crops were entered, and the fields which had borne a kharif harvest, and which exhibited the stubble, but crops of kharif which had been replaced by cold weather crops, were not apparent to the observer, and were not entered. The crops which have suffered most from this omission are juar and the maset, or mixed crop of mash (or urd) and moth.\n\nThe main feature of Sultanpur cultivation is the predominance of the two staples\u2014wheat and rice\u2014to the exclusion of maize, barley, &c. High cultivation\u2014such as tobacco, sugarcane, poppy, and vegetable\u2014requiring repeated irrigations amounts to 32,600 acres, or about 6 per cent. of the total; this is fairly good. The departmental opium return gives the opium areas at 4,103 and 3,842 acres\u2014a about half the area in Rae Bareli. The outturn in these two years amounted to 1,430 maunds, and the amount paid to the cultivators, at Rs. 5 the ser, to Rs. 2,86,000:\n\n| Name of crop          | Area in acres |\n|-----------------------|---------------|\n| Dhan                  | 201,333       |\n| Kapas (cotton)        | 5,854         |\n| Sugarcane             | 8,056         |\n| Indigo                | 309           |\n| Tobacco               | 6,861         |\n| Juar (Indian-corn)    | 4,200         |\n| Oil seeds             | 765           |\n| Vegetables            | 2,285         |\n| Miscellaneous         | 10,833        |\n| **Total**             | **239,127**   |\n\n* Statistical Tables I.E.2.\n\u2020 Statistical Tables L.A.1.\n**RABI CROPS.**\n\n| Name of crop | Area in acres |\n|--------------|---------------|\n| Wheat        | 148,092       |\n| Gram and arhar | 44,508       |\n| Poppy        | 5,111         |\n| Vegetables   | 3,305         |\n| Oil seeds    | 188           |\n| Miscellaneous| 48,247        |\n\nTotal: 249,296\n\nGrand Total: 488,483\n\n**Irrigation.**\u2014There is no correct information about the irrigable area of the present district. That of the old district was 77 per cent., and as that of Fyzabad, portions of which have been transferred to Sultanpur, was 72 per cent., we may say roughly that three quarters of the present district are irrigable, while none of the tahsils present any special features in this respect.\n\nThis however is the often sanguine settlement estimate; it applies only to ordinary years; this year (1877) not one-twentieth of the kharif has been irrigated, and unless we have heavy rain, the wells will soon be as dry as the jhils now are, and the rabi sowings will not germinate.\n\n**Food of the people.**\u2014The principal food at present, September 5th, is a mixture of barley and mahua; the former is at 18 to 19 sers the rupee, the latter is at about 2\u00bd maunds the rupee, the crop having been very good, wheat is at 14 sers, gram is at 20 sers the rupee; a common food is birra or barley and gram mixed.\n\nThe following quotations are from Dr. Day\u2019s \u201cFisheries\u201d:\n\n\u201cThe Collector of Sultanpur observes that breeding fish and young ones are destroyed, but not to any great extent. Those taken are from tanks and marshes fed by the rain, or filled by the overflow of rivers such as the Gumti. The meshes of the nets are small enough when so required to catch fish about the size of a gudgeon. Interference is not considered desirable, because there would be a difficulty at first in the novelty of making regulations laying down the size of the mesh of nets, and he refrains from answering what size he considers advisable. As a rule, the fry of fish are reported not to be sold in the bazar, and he would avoid all novel regulations suitable for European countries, interfering with property and old customs. He considers no objection exists to a close season for breeding fish in hilly districts.\u201d\u2014Para. 286, \u201cFrancis Day\u2019s Freshwater Fish and Fisheries of India and Burma.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt Sultanpur the native official estimates the fishermen at from 900 to 1,000, all of whom have also other occupations; they are Mullahs, Kahars, Kewats, and Gurias. The markets are said to be fairly supplied with fish, the larger sorts obtaining from an anna and a quarter to two annas a ser, and the smaller from three quarters to one anna and a quarter a ser; whilst the bazar mutton obtains from one and a quarter to two annas a ser. Three-fourths of the population are said to eat fish. The amount in the Gumti are said to have decreased of late years.\u201d\nVery small ones are netted and taken by a trap called 'puhra.' The mesh of the nets 'is so small, hardly anything can pass.' Fish, but not to any great extent, are trapped in the inundated fields during the rains. Streams are dammed and fish thus taken; various sorts of nets, traps, and hooks are also employed.\"\u2014Para. 307, \"Francis Day's Fresh-water Fish and Fisheries of India and Burma.\"\n\nPrices.\u2014The average prices for the last six years for ju\u00e1r, gram, and wheat were as follows:\n\n| Year | Wheat per Re. | Gram per Re. | Ju\u00e1r per Re.

traffic.\u2014The most common objects of internal traffic are grain, cotton, molasses (gur), salt, and native cloth; at Perkinsganj, Sukul bazar, and Aliganj a respectable trade in cattle may be added.\nExports and imports.\u2014Exports and imports are almost identical with the articles just enumerated; they become one or the other according to the comparative prices prevailing in this district and adjacent ones; cattle form an exception; the demand for the local breed is altogether limited to the district itself.\n\nManufactures.\u2014Manufactures are even of less consequence than trade. Textile industry of a very humble kind is common among the Kori and Jul\u0101ha castes. It flourishes principally at J\u0101is,* where various sorts of cloth, plain and brocaded, are manufactured; a peculiar kind of muslin (tanzeb) is the most famous. In this the weavers have a curious art of in-weaving, at the time of manufacture any design that may be suggested to them, verses and sentences are most common, but these are varied to suit every creed and taste. Some are passages from the Koran, others Hindu Ishloks, others a verse or two from the most instructive of Dr. Watt\u2019s moral songs and hymns. Bandhua enjoys a limited renown for its metal vessels, and other rough sorts of metal-work. Sugar and indigo are manufactured in a very small scale in pargana Ch\u0101nda. Under native rule the manufacture of salt and saltpetre was largely carried on, but it has now been discontinued.\n\nCommunications.\u2014The main channels of traffic are the river Gumti and the various roads by which the district is intersected, but beasts of burden are extensively employed, and these find their way from one place to another, little checked by the absence of roads.\n\nThe Gumti will serve to connect the whole of the northern and eastern portion of the district with the station of the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway at Jaunpur. It is scarcely, if at all, used for passenger traffic, the neighbouring road being more advantageous for the purpose, the difference in length between the two being much the same as the sum of the length of several arcs and the sum of the lengths of their chords. For freight, however, where speed is a secondary object, it is much used, being navigable hereabouts for country boats of 800 or 1,000 maunds burden. It should thus become a valuable feeder of the railway, unless all that is at present taken to the Jaunpur market is required for the consumption of that vicinity.\n\nOther stations of the same railway lie at an easy distance to the north, for communication with which there are many roads easily traversable by wheeled carriage. The Gumti intervenes, but is passable in many places. At \u00c1mgh\u00e1t, a few miles north-east of Jagd\u00edspur, it is spanned by a lofty pile bridge consisting of fifteen bays. The platform is 16 feet in width, and is supported by strut and straining beam trusses; it stands at a height of twenty-four feet above the summer level of the water. At Sultanpur there is a similar bridge, of somewhat larger dimensions. Ferries are numerous.\n\nRoads.\u2014The principal road by which the district is connected with the outer world is the imperial high road from Fyzabad to Allahabad. It enters the district due north of the civil station, which it crosses, and running nearly due south passes into the Partabgarh district about twelve miles further on. It is metalled and bridged throughout that distance.\n\n* Since transferred to Rao Bareli.\nAll the other roads are unmetalled, but bridged where necessary, and except when subjected to very severe trials, such as that of exceedingly heavy rains, are usually fit for any sort of traffic. They are as follows:\u2014\n\nThe Lucknow-Jaunpur road. This enters the district at a point two miles east of Haidargarh, and leaves it two miles east of Chanda; its total length within these limits being seventy miles, in the course of which it traverses the town of Inhauna, Nihalgarh, and the village of Saraiyan, in which are the headquarters of the Musafirkhana tahsil. It leaves the civil station about two miles to the north, but is connected with it by three separate lines\u2014(1) metalled from Amghat, (2) also metalled from the point of its intersection with the Allahabad road, (3) unmetalled from Lucknow.\n\nThe Sultanpur-Rae Bareli road. This starts from Sultanpur and skirting the large village of Dhamaur, the bazar of Gauriganj, and the town of Jais, leaves the district about eleven miles from the last named place.\n\nThe Fyzabad-Rae Bareli road. This crosses the Gumti over the Amghat bridge, cuts the Lucknow road at Jagdispur; it is thence continued to the Mohanganj thana, and thence onward through the pargana of that name into Rae Bareli.\n\nThese constitute as it were local trunk lines, and the Imperial road excepted, throw out lateral branches in various directions, regarding which sufficient particulars may be given in the following tabular form:\n\n| No | Main road.          | Point of divergence | Direction                                      | Length in miles |\n|----|---------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| 1  | Lucknow-Jaunpur.    | In Inhauna          | North-east to Aishghat                         | 11              |\n| 2  | Ditto               | Ditto               | South to Mohanganj, where it joins the Fyzabad-Rae Bareli road. | 10              |\n| 3  | Ditto               | In Jagdispur        | Nearly due south to Jais                      | 14              |\n| 4  | Ditto               | Musafirkhana        | South-west to Gauriganj, where it meets the Sultanpur-Rae Bareli road | 13              |\n| 5  | Ditto               | Lambusa             | North to Deraghat                             | 2\u00bd              |\n| 6  | Ditto               | Chanda              | South-west to Saltabad in the Partabgarh district. | 4               |\n| 7  | Sultanpur-Rae Bareli.| Sultanpur           | West to Kurw\u00e1r                                | 9               |\n| 8  | Ditto               | Near the village Dhamaur. | South-west via Amethi to Salon in the district of Rae Bareli. | 19              |\n| 9  | Ditto               | Gauriganj           | South-east via Amethi to Partabgarh            | 16\u00bd             |\n| 10 | Fyzabad-Rae Bareli.| Mohanganj           | South-east to Jais, connecting the Sultanpur-Rae Bareli and Fyzabad-Rae Bareli roads. | 9               |\n\nIf the map be examined, it will be seen that every part of the district is well supplied with roads, with the exception of a triangle lying between Sultanpur, Chanda, and Amethi, within which they are conspicuous by their absence. The only route from Chanda to Amethi is via Sultanpur, and this involves a detour of several miles.\nThough scarcely deserving the name of roads, village cart tracks must not be altogether omitted. Numbers of these have been aligned and inequalities of surface partially removed; they will in time perhaps prove a valuable addition to regular roads; at present, however, they are only practicable for country carts at once strong and lightly laden.\n\nThe following is an extract from the official route book:\n\nThere is one metalled road in this district which goes from Fyzabad to Allahabad, passing for 29 miles throughout this district. There are three encamping grounds on this road\u2014one at the 26th mile near Kur\u00e1bh\u00e1r, one near the 29th mile on the east side of the road, and a third at the 48th mile also on the east side of the road. At the 26th mile a road branches off on the west side to Am\u00e1n\u00edganj and on the east to Akbarpur, Am\u00e1n\u00edganj being 34 miles from the pargana road, and Akbarpur 32 miles. At the 31st mile near the village Katka a road branches off on the east side to Akbarpur (Railway Station, Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway), the distance from Katka to Akbarpur being 24 miles. At the 39th milestone a road branches off on the west to Lucknow, and on the east to Jaunpur, the distances from the point where they leave the pargana road to Lucknow and to Jaunpur being respectively 84 and 50 miles. The Gumti is the only river.\n\nBazars.\u2014Most villages of any consequence have their own bazars, either permanent or periodical. The latter are often nothing more than open air markets held on certain fixed days of the week; the former are often large walled enclosures, bisected by a road and lined with shops on either side. These local bazars are small but important media of commerce. Every village may be said to be affiliated to one of them, and each of them in turn is connected in its dealings with one or more of the larger centres of traffic.\n\nThe principal bazars are as follows\u2014(1) Perkinsganj at the civil station, founded shortly after re-occupation by Colonel Perkins, Deputy Commissioner. One of the newest, it nevertheless is one of the most, if not the most flourishing in the district. A large trade is carried on here, and goods are brought for sale from a great distance. Its rapid growth has been favoured by the extremely convenient nature of its position. It is in close proximity to the district court-house, the sadr tahsil, and the th\u00e1nas, and is hence much frequented by persons whose business takes them to those places. It is also little more than half a mile from the right bank of the Gumti, so that if trade be slack here, unsold goods can be easily placed in boats and carried by water to Jaunpur. (2) Sukul bazar, in the village Mawayya Rahmatgarh, pargana Jagd\u00edspur, founded about forty years ago by some members of a well to do Sukul (Brahmin) family. It shared with Perkinsganj the advantage of being near the Gumti. (3) Gauriganj, called after the deity of that name, and founded by R\u00e1ja M\u00e1dho Singh of Amethi about 25 years ago. It is situated in the village of R\u00e1jgarh a few miles east of J\u00e1s\u00ed. (4) Bandhua, an old bazar on the Lucknow-Jaunpur road close to Hasanpur. (5) Aliganj, in the village Unchg\u00e1on, pargana Sultanpur, founded in 1202 fasli (A.D. 1795) by the taluqdar of Mani\u00e1rpur.\n## CHAPTER III.\n\n### THE PEOPLE\n\nPopulation\u2014Classification\u2014Class distribution\u2014Character of the people\u2014Condition of the people\u2014Habitations\u2014Shrines and fairs of interest\u2014Tenures\u2014List of taluqdars.\n\n### Area and Population.\n\n| Pargana | Number of mauzas or townships | Area in British square miles | Population |\n|---------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|\n|         |                               | Total | Cultivated | Hindu | Mahomedan | Male | Female | Total | Number of persons to each square mile |\n| Sultanpur | 899                           | 216   | 125        | 138,357 | 20,968    | 86,663 | 78,562 | 159,225 | 644 |\n| Sultanpur and Baraunna | 460 | 258 | 146 | 143,882 | 11,358 | 79,169 | 76,071 | 155,240 | 601 |\n| Total | 859 | 504 | 271 | 282,239 | 39,226 | 159,832 | 154,683 | 314,465 | 624 |\n| Isanli | 183 | 147 | 7 | 87,939 | 9,244 | 48,101 | 49,042 | 97,145 | 660 |\n| Jagdispur | 166 | 154 | 78 | 80,683 | 19,884 | 49,928 | 50,639 | 10,567 | 651 |\n| Gaura J\u00e1m\u00fan | 91 | 93 | 49 | 46,636 | 3,391 | 25,067 | 24,949 | 50,016 | 538 |\n| Total | 440 | 391 | 224 | 215,237 | 32,489 | 123,096 | 124,630 | 247,726 | 638 |\n| Amethi | 364 | 299 | 131 | 155,261 | 5,491 | 79,785 | 80,967 | 160,752 | 538 |\n| Tappa Aul | 97 | 67 | 32 | 37,163 | 1,108 | 19,300 | 18,986 | 38,286 | 571 |\n| Total | 461 | 366 | 163 | 192,444 | 6,594 | 99,085 | 99,953 | 199,038 | 432 |\n| Ch\u00e1nda | 99 | 130 | 73 | 69,091 | 3,502 | 38,025 | 34,568 | 72,593 | 558 |\n| Aldeman | 43 | 277 | 142 | 139,771 | 9,413 | 78,144 | 71,040 | 149,184 | 538 |\n| Surharpur | 36 | 33 | 14 | 12,659 | 271 | 6,895 | 6,035 | 12,930 | 392 |\n| Total | 763 | 440 | 229 | 221,521 | 13,186 | 123,064 | 111,693 | 234,707 | 533 |\n| District total | 2,523 | 1,704 | 887 | 911,441 | 84,495 | 505,077 | 490,859 | 995,936 | 584 |\n| European | | | | | | | | | |\n| Eurasian | | | | | | | | | |\n| Prisoners and employ\u00e9s in Jail | | | | | | | | | |\n| Grand Total | 2,523 | 1,704 | 887 | 911,441 | 84,495 | 505,077 | 490,859 | 995,936 | 584 |\nDensity of population.\u2014The district is very thickly inhabited. Mr. Williams shows that Oudh in density of population surpasses even the most populous countries of Europe, and Sultanpur, in respect of the average number per square mile, falls below three districts only of the province, while with regard to the number per cultivated acre it is equalled by Lucknow alone.\n\nClassification according to creed.\u2014The total population of the district according to the general census was 930,633*. It was divided into three great classes, the numbers of which were as follows:\n\n| Classification                  | Number |\n|---------------------------------|--------|\n| Christian (European and Eurasians) | 83     |\n| Muhammadans                     | 91,556 |\n| Hindus                          | 838,467|\n\nWhich, with 557 prisoners and employ\u00e9s in the jails, give the total mentioned above.\n\nChristians.\u2014The Christians, are very nearly all Government employ\u00e9s. It will be seen that there were no natives among them. Mr. Williams accounts for this by the very probable supposition that they have been entered in the returns as Europeans or Eurasians. The error as regards this district, however, was, so far as I am able to say, limited to a single instance, that of one Matthew, a cobbler.\n\nMusalmans.\u2014The Musalmans in all were rather less than one-tenth of the whole population. Of these again, about one-fourth only belonged to the Sayyad, Shekh, Mughal, and Path\u00e1n classes, another one-tenth was composed of converts from the principal Chhattri castes, and the remainder of all the lower castes of Muhammadans.\n\nHindus.\u2014The Hindus still form the bulk of the population; and of the multiplicity of castes into which they are divided, the Brahman predominates not only in social importance but also in numerical strength, forming no less than 14 per cent. of the inhabitants of the district. Next in both respects, among the higher castes, come the Chhattri clans aggregating 8 per cent., and after these come in order the Vaishyas and the K\u00e1yath. Of the meaner castes, the Ah\u00edr contains the largest number, nearly 10 per cent., and is followed by the Cham\u00e1r and P\u00e1si. G\u00fajars are more common in Sultanpur than elsewhere in the province.\n\nClassification according to occupation.\u2014Compared with the rest of Oudh, the district contained a large portion of non-agriculturists, and yet agriculturists amount to no less than 56\u00b79 per cent. Of the more skilful castes Mur\u00e1os are numerous, but Kurmis remarkably few.\n\nClass distribution.\u2014Musalmans of the higher classes are to be found only in towns. Hindu converts to Isl\u00e1mism are intermixed with their unconverted brethren. Of the Hindus the Chhattris are with a few\n\n* The details of the present population which amounts to 906,576 have already been given. The great difference between the population now and at the time of the census is due to redistribution of territory.\nexceptions lords of the soil: they lie in clans, and it may almost be said that each pargana has its own phylarchy. Brahmins and others are scattered about promiscuously; they own a village here and there usually acquired by grant or purchase from a Chhatti.\n\nCharacter of the people.\u2014The people are characterised by a bold and manly spirit. \"The natives say,\" remarks General Sleeman, \"that the air and water of Malwa may produce as good trees and crops as those of Oudh, but can never produce such good soldiers. This I believe is quite true. The Sultanpur district is included in the Banaudha division of Oudh, and the people speak of the water of this division for tempering soldiers as we talk of the water of Damascus for tempering sword blades.\n\n\"They certainly never seem so happy as when they are fighting in earnest with swords, spears, and matchlocks. The water of the Baiswara division is considered to be very little inferior to that of Banaudha, and we get our sipahis from these two divisions almost exclusively.\"\n\nTheir condition\u2014Under native rule no man's property or even life was safe for many days together; Government officials, instead of affording the protection it was their duty to, busied themselves only in their own enrichment, and became the most active oppressors of the people. They kept up duplicate accounts, the one forged for the minister at Lucknow, the other genuine for themselves, and in plain words embezzled the difference. Under the plausible pretext, therefore, of collecting the just revenue of the state, they extorted as much as they possibly could from the landholders of every degree.\n\nTheir immediate inability to pay was immaterial, if a money-lender could be found to advance the requisite amount; and in that case they were compelled to give their creditors a mortgage-deed bearing the exorbitant interest of 24 per cent. per annum. The example set by officials was readily followed by private individuals, and the consequence was that every zamindar kept as many armed retainers as his means permitted, nominally to repel force by force when necessary, but in reality employed as often as not for purposes of aggression. Under such circumstances there was little inducement, even where the opportunity occurred to attempt to accumulate capital, and the result is that the landed proprietors are now, as a rule, poor, unthrifty, and deeply involved in debt.\n\nIn sketching such a state of things in the past and present, it is natural to look also towards the future, and here it is gratifying to find that the prospect is considerably brighter.\n\nThe landholder, while conscious that if he would retain his estate, the payment of the revenue assessed upon it is indispensable, also knows that that amount will not be exceeded; he is confident, too, that no powerful neighbour will carry off his harvests, and thus deprive him of the means of paying it, he finds additional safety in the ever-increasing price of agricultural produce, and if, in an unfortunate season, he is obliged to resort to the money-lender, he is charged no more than half the former rate of interest. For the relief and protection of the more important encumbered\nestates special measures have been taken. If, then, I have correctly described the causes of the present unsatisfactory condition of the proprietary classes, it may be concluded, with moderate certainty, that a prosperous future will follow the altered circumstances in which they are now placed.\n\nThe dwellings of the people are usually grouped together in towns and villages; but single huts or houses are not uncommon. Towns are few in number.\n\nIn some parts villages are large and at a distance from each other, as in the Mohanganj tahsil,* the unsettled state of which perhaps led the inhabitants to band themselves together in large bodies for mutual protection. Further east, on the other hand, where shankalps are numerous, and the shankalpdars have founded purwas on their holdings, villages are small and hamlets abound. In Chanda solitary houses are pretty thickly scattered over the pargana. Domestic architecture is principally remarkable for its monotonous simplicity. The most common description of house consists of walls of puddled mud, and a roof of thatch or tiles. Even this is beyond the reach of all; many an agriculturist is, but the \"monarch of a shed.\" On the other hand, a few substantial brick houses may be found here and there they belong to the more wealthy landowners, to successful traders, or Muhammadans of the better classes.\n\nShrines, fairs, places of interest.\u2014It may seem odd to place shrines and fairs in the same category; but there are few if any of the latter which have not a religious character attached to them.\n\nSitakund.\u2014On the right bank of the river Gumti, immediately below the civil station, the place is still pointed out where the now deified Sita is said to have bathed while accompanying her husband Rama into his self-imposed exile. In commemoration of that event a fair is held there twice a year (Jeth dasahra and Kartik puranmashi), to which the pious Hindus of the neighbourhood throng to the number of fifteen or twenty thousand. The fair lasts for a few hours only, the visitors bathing immediately on their arrival and then taking their departure. A few enterprising sweetmeat vendors from the Perkinsganj bazar find their way there, but otherwise no attempt is made at traffic.\u2020\n\nDhopap.\u2014Dhopap, in the village of Rajapatti. The triumph of Rama's return from his long exile was clouded by the recollection of a great crime committed in the achievement of his principal exploit, his victory\n\n* Part of this has since been transferred to Rae Bareli.\n\u2020 In this part of the Gumti, between Sitakund and Dhopap, there are said to have been at one time 360 places of pilgrimage; but there is probably a mere local adoption of a common fable. A similar story is told of a lake near Thanesar (Arc. Geo. 323), and the same number of temples is said to have been built at Ajodhya by Bikramjit (Elliot's Supplementary Glossary, Chaurasi).\nover R\u00e1wan, for he had thereby incurred the guilt of Brahmanicide. His spiritual advisers accordingly set to work to find the means of effecting his purification; and a moral Bethesda so to say was discovered in a particular part of the Gumti in the present village of Rajapatti, bathing at which was pronounced to be efficacious for the purpose. Rama performed the enjoined ablution and his guilt was thereby removed. The spot was thus sanctified thenceforward and received the appellation of Dhop\u00e1p, which being interpreted signifies the place that \"cleanseth away sin.\" Fairs are held here similar to those at Sitakund, but the Jeth gathering is somewhat larger.\n\n\"The site of Dhop\u00e1p,\" says General Cunningham, \"is evidently one of a very considerable antiquity as the whole country for more than half a mile around it is covered with broken bricks and pottery.\n\n\"The place is said to have belonged to the Bhar R\u00e1jas of Kusabh\u00e1wanpur or Sultanpur, but the only name that I could hear of as specially connected with Dhop\u00e1p was that of R\u00e1ja Hel or Hela.\" Close to Dhop\u00e1p are the ruins of an old fort, which, as shown by a local investigation made by a native official a few years ago, in a suit between two landed proprietors, is commonly known as Garh or Shergarh. Both these names point to its construction, or reconstruction, by the S\u00far king Sher Shah, assisted very probably, as some accounts say, by his son Salem Shah. To them also is attributed the first erection of an old mosque in the neighbourhood which was repaired by Safdarjang, and subsequently used as a school, but now for some time altogether deserted. General Cunningham mentions several carved stones which have been collected by the people from the ruined fort, and says that they point unmistakeably to the existence at some former period of a large temple at Dhop\u00e1p, probably one only of a considerable number at that place.\n\n\"I obtained,\" says the same writer, \"coins of many of the early Muhammadan kings, from Nas\u00edr-ud-d\u00edn Mahm\u00fad Ghori down to Akbar, but not a single specimen of any Hindu coinage, although I was informed that coins bearing figures are found every year during the rainy season.\" One particular coin of this kind is better remembered than any other by the villagers; it was picked up shortly after annexation, and is said to have contained the device of a cone on one side and a flag on the other.\n\nP\u00e1pargh\u00e1t.\u2014Safdarjang, having established his virtual independence of the Mughal emperor, determined to build a new capital. He selected as the site for it the high bank of the Gumti overlooking P\u00e1pargh\u00e1t in the village of Sh\u00e1hpur, pargana Ch\u00e1nda, and, but for the accident of a sickly season, that now comparatively unknown locality might have enjoyed the celebrity that afterwards fell to the lot of Fyzabad. The construction of a fort was commenced, and the walls had already risen to some height, when the emperor receiving intelligence of this presumptuous act of his now independent, but still nominal minister, sent him messages of congratulation, and a \"khilat\" (dress of honour), to all outward\nappearance, suitable to his rank and dignity. The royal gift had been packed up with becoming care, and its acceptance does not appear to have struck Safdarjang as incompatible with the rebellious attitude he had assumed. The box in which it was enclosed was opened with due ceremony, when it was discovered that the emperor, with grim pleasantry, had selected as an appropriate gift an image of Mari Bhaw\u00e1ni! That neither donor nor recipient venerated that goddess, mattered no more than that the Philistines regarded the ark with little reverence; the one was as fatal by its presence as the other, and the mortality which ensued in Safdarjang's camp was perfectly appalling. The simple expedient resorted to by the Philistines does not appear to have occurred to the modern sufferers, who adopted the more cumbrous measure of moving their whole army; and Mari Bhaw\u00e1ni was left in undisturbed possession. The unfinished walls still exist, and the triumph of the destructive goddess is celebrated by periodical fairs, held in the months of Ku\u00e1r and Chait, which are attended by 10,000 to 12,000 persons.\n\nS\u00e1g\u00e1r.\u2014S\u00e1g\u00e1r in the village of Bandhua, in the Sultanpur pargana, is a fine large masonry tank, on the border of which stands what may be called, in comparison with any thing to be found for a long distance, an imposing pile of buildings. The tank was dug at the expense of one B\u00e1ba Sahajr\u00e1m, a N\u00e1naksh\u00e1hi Faq\u00edr, a great miracle-monger, and is thence known as B\u00e1ba Ji-k\u00e1-s\u00e1g\u00e1r. The buildings mentioned were the B\u00e1ba's residence. He and his successors received several revenue-free grants from officials in the king's time, and these have now been confirmed in perpetuity by the British Government. A large concourse of people, about 8,000 to 10,000, assemble at this tank at fairs held every year in the months of K\u00e1rtik, Chait, and Jeth.\n\nLohr\u00e1mau.\u2014In the village Lohram\u00e1u, pargana Sultanpur, is a shrine of Debi, which is said to occupy the site of an old Bhar temple. There is now a brick shrine enclosed by mud walls, but these were erected only twenty five years ago by the zamindars of the village. Three or four hundred people collect here every Monday, and a much larger number twice a year in the months of Ku\u00e1r and Chait to worship the presiding goddess.\n\nSet Bar\u00e1h.\u2014In the village of Kotwa, a mile or two south-east of the \u00c1mg\u00e1h\u00e1t bridge, nearly at the summit of a lofty mound overlooking the river Gumti stands a small shrine. In point of size it is very insignificant, but this is more than compensated by its extreme sanctity. It is dedicated to the \"white boar,\" one of the incarnations of Vishnu. It is reputed to contain a statue of the god, but such is not the case; all there is to do duty for it is a small hollowed block of carved stone. In what its similitude to a boar consists it is difficult to say. There is perhaps a bare possibility that it represents the jaws of that animal as depicted on the B\u00e1r\u00e1h coins, but even this is improbable, and if it be the case, the figure to which it belonged must have been of colossal proportions. All that the villages can contribute to the explana-\ntion of the mystery is that the stone was picked up out of the river below, and enshrined in the little edifice which now holds it. I am disposed to conjecture that there once stood on the spot a famous temple of the boar-god, which was long ago destroyed; but that the memory of it having outlived its destruction, the present modest substitute was erected, and when the stone was found, it was hailed as the return of the tenant god. In the immediate vicinity are several brick-strewn or rather brick-built mounds of various dimensions. The largest of them, that nearly touching the present village, and the only one of which I could learn anything, is said to have been the site of an old Bhar fortress. It is very probable that a town of considerable importance once existed here, and the name of the village itself Kotwa, a colloquial corruption of Kot, implies the former presence of some sort of fortification.\n\nOn the peak of the same mound as the Set B\u00e1r\u00e1h temple lies the tomb of a faqir, who after a life of mortification and penance died here about five hundred years ago. Austerity and devotion, say the sacred books of the Hindus, bring to those who practice them, with the requisite degree of earnestness, power to control and suspend the laws of nature; and to this pitch of holiness did our faqir attain. The story is still told to admonish the incredulous how he walked at will upon the river, and the obedient waters rose not above his sandals.\n\nAt this spot of two-fold sanctity a fair is held every year at full moon in the month of K\u00e1rtik; it lasts a day and night, and attracts visitors from a distance of twenty miles round to the number of 25,000. Vendors of fruit and sweetmeats avail themselves of the occasion to turn an honest penny.\n\nOther fairs.\u2014The six fairs above described are the principal ones of the district, and however little worthy of mention they may be, the others are still less so. Ample justice will be done them in a tabular list:\u2014\n\n| Name of village | Name of pargana |\n|-----------------|----------------|\n| 1. Harg\u00f3n       | ...            |\n| 2.

It is simply an arbitrary aggregation of a few parganas, the number of which may be varied at pleasure, without causing much inconvenience or confusion. It has no counterpart whatever that I am aware of in Akbar\u2019s arrangements; the \u201cdastur,\u201d the nearest to it, being rather a district. An approximation to it came into existence in the constitution of the chakla by S\u00e1d-ulla Khan, minister of Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1n, and its formal reintroduction in the time of Sa\u00e1dat Ali Khan.\n\nThere were then also tahsildars eo nomine, but their jurisdictions were scarcely analogous to the present tahsils.\n\nPargana.\u2014The pargana, on the other hand, may lay claim to considerable antiquity; it is usually believed to have succeeded a still older division, the tappa, which must itself have been in common use for some length of time, as the recollection of it still survives in various familiar names,* though in all other respects it has long been obsolete. The pargana on its first introduction became to the tappa what the tahsil is now to the pargana, the former usually consisting of two or more of the latter; and in old documents the two divisions may be found mentioned together, though their co-existence was probably never recognized officially.\n\nThe exact date of the creation of the pargana is uncertain. Sir H. Elliott says that the name means \u201ctax-paying land,\u201d and mentions instances of its use in A.D. 1210 and again in A.D. 1350. Mr. C. A. Elliott in the Chronicles of Oonao shows that it is possible the pargana was constituted by Shah\u00e1b-ud-din Ghori, and the use of the word in the early years of the thirteenth century favours the supposition. It occurs in B\u00e1bar\u2019s Memoirs, but on the other hand, is not exclusively employed in the \u00c1\u00edn-i-Akbari, where the term muh\u00e1l is often used as its equivalent. The co-extensiveness of a pargana with the possessions of a clan or individual family has often formed the subject of remark, and in its convertibility with muh\u00e1l here illustrated lies a very possible explanation of the circumstance; for it suggests that the pargana was not only tax-paying land, but that like the muh\u00e1l it was a separately possessed parcel of such land; in other words, that it was founded on the distribution of properties at the time of its creation. Dr. W. Oldham seems to take a somewhat similar view when he says that \u201cin the early days of Muham-madan empire parganas appear to have been clearings or cultivated spaces in the forest, occupied generally by a single but sometimes by more than\n\n* For example, Tappa Aal, a name often given to the pargana.\none fraternity or clan;\" and Mr. C. A. Elliott thinks there is no doubt that if they are attributable to Shah\u00e1b-ud-d\u00edn Ghori they are based on still more ancient divisions which he found already in existence. Further confirmation of the theory I follow lies in the fact, of which numerous examples might be found, that pargana limits have often been expanded or contracted to suit the growth or decay of private estates. The following table, which was prepared before the redistribution of territory, shows of what parganas and tahsils the Sultanpur (settlement) district was till lately composed, together with the tappas, muh\u00e1ls, and chaklas out of which they were developed.\n\nTerritorial Divisions, past and present.\n\n| Number | Taluq. | British. | Nawabi. |\n|--------|-------|----------|---------|\n|        |       | Present parganas. | Summary settlement parganas. | Nizamat | Chakla. |\n|        |       | No. of villages. | No. of villages. |         |         |\n| 1      | SULTANPUR | Ch\u00e1nda ... | 290 | Ch\u00e1nda ... | 310 | Sultanpur ... | Sultanpur ... |\n|        |       | P\u00e9par Gh\u00e1t ... | 92 | ... | ... | ... | ... |\n| 2      | Sultanpur ... | Sultanpur ... | 399 | Sultanpur ... | 432 | Sultanpur ... | Sultanpur ... |\n|        |       | Mir\u00e1npur ... | 48 | ... | ... | ... | ... |\n| 3      | Inhauna ... | Inhauna ... | 77 | Baisw\u00e1ra ... | 89 | Haldargarh ... |\n| 4      | Subeha ... | Subeha ... | 86 | Ditto ... | 207 | Ditto ... |\n| 5      | Jagdispur ... | Jagdispur ... | 166 | Sultanpur ... | 278 | Jagdispur* ... |\n| 6      | Asl or Tappa Asl | Asl | 97 | Ditto ... | 156 | Sultanpur ... |\n| 7      | Amethi ... | Amethi ... | 364 | Ditto ... | 826 | Jagdispur\u2020 ... |\n| 8      | Isanli ... | Isanli ... | 85 | Ditto ... | 106 | Sultanpur ... |\n| 9      | Gaura J\u00e1m\u00fan, | Gaura ... | 91 | ... | 77 | Salon ... |\n|        |       | J\u00e1m\u00fan ... | 101 | Sultanpur ... | ... | Jagdispur ... |\n| 10     | Rokha J\u00e1s ... | Rokha ... | 110 | ... | 100 | Salon ... |\n|        |       | J\u00e1s ... | 86 | ... | ... | Ditto ... |\n| 11     | Simrauta ... | Simrauta ... | 73 | ... | 97 | Ditto ... |\n| 12     | Mohanganj ... | Mohanganj ... | 75 | ... | 99 | Ditto ... |\n\n* This chakla was sometimes separately held, sometimes included in Chakla Sultanpur.\n\u2020 Kishni by itself constitutes a dast\u00e1r.\nTerritorial Divisions, past and present.\u2014(concluded.)\n\n| Number | Tahsil | Mughal | Hindu |\n|--------|--------|--------|-------|\n|        |        | Subah  | Sark\u00e1r | Dast\u00far | Muh\u00e1l | Tappas |\n| 1      | Allahabad, Janpur ... | Haweli Janpur ... | Ch\u00e1da ... | None known. |\n|        | Oudh ... | Oudh ... | Haweli, Oudh, Bilshri (part) | Ditto. |\n| 2      | Ditto ... | Ditto ... | Ditto ... | Sultanpur (part). | 1 Hawal or Hasanpur. |\n|        | Allahabad. | M\u00e1nikpur | M\u00e1nikpur b\u00e1 Hawell. | Kathat ... | 2 Tappa Ti\u00e1r or Harkpur. |\n|        | Oudh ... | Oudh ... | Haweli, Oudh | Inhauna ... | 3 Sondal. |\n| 4      | Ditto ... | Ditto ... | Ditto ... | Subehs ... | 4 P\u00fara or Pure Bagh R\u00e1e. |\n| 5      | Ditto ... | Ditto ... | 1 Ditto ... | 1 S\u00e1tanpur ... | Ditto |\n|        | Ditto ... | Ditto ... | 2 Kishni \u2020 ... | 2 Kishni ... | Ditto |\n| 6      | Ditto ... | Ditto ... | Haweli Oudh, Th\u00e1na Bha-daun. | Tappa Asl |\n| 7      | Ditto ... | Lucknow ... | Haweli, Luck-now. | Garh Ame-thi. |\n| 8      | Ditto ... | Ditto ... | Ditto ... | Isauli ... |\n| 9      | Allahabad, M\u00e1nikpur ... | Rae Bareli ... | J\u00e1s ... |\n|        | ... ... | ... ... | ... ... | ... ... |\n| 10     | Allahabad, M\u00e1nikpur ... | M\u00e1nik b\u00e1 Hawell. | Nas\u00edrabed (part) |\n|        | ... ... | Rae Bareli ... | J\u00e1s (part) ... |\n| 11     | Allahabad, M\u00e1nikpur ... | Ditto ... | Ditto ... |\n| 12     | Ditto ... | Ditto ... | Ditto ... |\n\nMuh\u00e1l.\u2014The term muh\u00e1l has long been extinct as expressive of territorial division, and I question whether, in that sense, it ever took any\n\n* In the assignment of muh\u00e1ls to dast\u00far subahs and subahs Prof. Blochmann's \u00c1\u00edn-i-Akbari (text) is followed.\n\n\u2020 In Chakla Partabgarh till 1249 fa\u1e63l; in Jagdispur (muh\u00e1l tahsil) from 1250 fa\u1e63l; Harurah tahsil from 1253 fa\u1e63l till annexation.\ngreat hold upon popular favour. It is still, however, in ordinary official use to denote the individuality of estates held under separate revenue engagements. With this signification it forms the revenue subdivision of the pargana, and is, indeed, the unit of revenue responsibility. It forms also the point where official fiscal arrangements become merged in private land tenures; for each muh\u00e1l is represented by one or more lambardars or headmen, who possess a double character\u2014on the one hand they are private persons, members of the proprietary body of the muh\u00e1l, raised to their representative position in conformity with rules springing out of the past customs of the family: on the other hand, they are invested with a quasi-official position, inasmuch as they have delegated to them the duty of collecting the revenue payable by their co-sharers, and are primarily responsible to the state for its collection.\n\nVillage.\u2014As the muh\u00e1l is the unit of fiscal subdivision of the pargana, so is the village or township the unit of local subdivision. The townships, says Elphinstone, are the indestructible atoms, from an aggregate of which the most extensive Indian empires are composed, just as Creasy says Anglo-Saxon townships were the integral molecules out of which the Anglo-Saxon state was formed.\n\nPolice.\u2014With respect to police jurisdictions, th\u00e1na circles take the place of the fiscal arrangement of parganas. Their boundaries sometimes but not always coincide. In the district as it stood previous to July, 1869, eight th\u00e1nas corresponded to twelve parganas, and in the changes which then took place, symmetry was again subordinated to convenience and utility; the principle acted upon was that each village should report to the nearest th\u00e1na, subject to any modifications which might be caused by the local topography of the country.\n\nThe police force consists of two branches, the regular belonging to a provincial establishment, and the rural which is purely local. The first is partly distributed at the th\u00e1nas partly employed as jail and treasury guards, and partly held in reserve at headquarters. The regular force allotted to the district numbers 379 of all ranks.\n\nThe rural police or village chaukidars at the time of settlement were 2,664 in number, or one to every 354 of population. Each of them had his separate fixed beat extending over an average area of 377 acres. A large majority of the chaukidars belong to the P\u00e1si and other low castes; but a Brahman now and then condescends to fill the post with very questionable advantage, I believe, to the village he honours with his service.\n\nStatement showing the population of th\u00e1nas.\n\n| Name of Th\u00e1na | Population |\n|---------------|------------|\n| Raipur        | 139,645    |\n| Jag\u00e1npur      | 129,697    |\n| Mus\u00e1firkhana   | 174,708    |\n| Kur\u00e1bhh\u00e1r     | 114,246    |\n| Piparpur      | 64,044     |\n| Dostpur       | 87,978     |\n| Sultanpur     | 1'0,190    |\n| Lambha        | 86,584     |\n| K\u00e9dipur       | 98,694     |\n| **Total**     | **1,000,786** |\n\nThe total population in this calculation which has been made later differs somewhat from that given in the table of area and population in Chapter III.\n### Crime Statistics\n\n| Year | Cases reported | Cases investigated | Cases convicted |\n|------|----------------|--------------------|-----------------|\n| 1867 |                |                    |                 |\n| 1868 |                |                    |                 |\n| 1869 |                |                    |                 |\n| 1870 |                |                    |                 |\n| 1871 |                |                    |                 |\n| 1872 |                |                    |                 |\n\n#### Comparative Memo. of accidental deaths.\n\n| Year | Suicides | By drowning | By snake bite | By wild quadrupeds | By fall of buildings | By other causes | Total |\n|------|----------|-------------|---------------|--------------------|---------------------|----------------|-------|\n|      | Male     | Female      | Male          | Female             | Male                | Female         |       |\n| 1867 |          |             |               |                    |                     |                |       |\n| 1868 |          |             |               |                    |                     |                |       |\n| 1869 |          |             |               |                    |                     |                |       |\n| 1870 |          |             |               |                    |                     |                |       |\n| 1871 |          |             |               |                    |                     |                |       |\n| 1872 |          |             |               |                    |                     |                |       |\n\nThe following statements give the receipts and expenditure of the district for 1872:\n\n#### Receipts.\n\n1.

Of these the principal is the high school at the civil station. Instruction is afforded in it in four languages, viz., English, Urdu, Hindi, and Persian, together with a variety of other subjects. The standard it teaches up to is that of the entrance examination of the Calcutta University; next in importance comes the town school of Jagdispur. Then come the village schools. In these of course a lower standard is aimed at, and the curriculum embraces fewer subjects than in the high school, but their usefulness and suitability to the requirements of the village population is manifested by the fact that they attract more than four thousand students.\n\nThis class of schools at the outset entails a good deal of trouble and expense for building, training teachers, &c., so that they must be established gradually; and as those now in existence come into full working order, some augmentation of their number will take place. The total number of persons who attend the Government schools is 4,607.\n\n**Postal.**\u2014Postal arrangements on a somewhat limited scale were established soon after the re-occupation of the province; they were, however, almost entirely restricted to the conveyance of the mails to and from outlying th\u0101nas and tahsils, and the extension of regular postal communications throughout the interior of the district was deferred till the present settlement, being one of certain specific objects for which provision was then directed to be made. Settlement officers were charged with making\nthe requisite arrangements, the main principles laid down for their guidance being that the th\u00e1na and tahsil officials should, as far as possible, be relieved of postal duties that a system of independent rural offices should be established, and that there should be a postal delivery in every village.\n\nSimultaneously therefore with the introduction of the revised assessments into any pargana or tahsil a postal scheme satisfying the above condition was introduced therein, and at the end of last year was in operation throughout the whole district with the exception of pargana Ch\u00e1nda.\n\nThe working of the scheme was originally placed in the hands of the district officer, but in 1871 with a view to the improvement of the postal service, the district post establishment throughout the province was reorganized as a separate institution, and the control and management was formally transferred to the Chief Inspector of Post-offices in Oudh.\n\nCertain modifications of previously existing arrangements naturally suggested themselves in the substitution of a single homogeneous scheme for one composed of sections constructed independently of each other and at different periods to keep pace with the revision of assessment. The system as it at present stands may be briefly thus described. There is an Imperial office at the civil station, which forms the connecting link between the internal and external postal lines; and rural offices have been fixed at the headquarters of each tahsil and at such other places within it as offer the most convenient sites, viz., Ramnia, Amethi, Gauriganj, Piparpur, Mus\u00e1firkhana, Jagdispur, Kishni, Gaura J\u00e1m\u00fan, K\u00e1d\u00edpur, Dostpur, Kuraibh\u00e1r. At Khairabad, Hanom\u00e1nganj, and Munshiganj offices have recently been abolished; at these places letter-boxes will continue to be kept up.\n\nThe neighbouring stations with which Sultanpur is connected by Imperial lines are those of Allahabad, Lucknow, Fyzabad, and Rae Bareli, communication with which is effected by means of foot runners; any more expeditious means of transit for the mails being still among the desiderata of the future, and dependent on correspondence with a concomitant increase of the postal revenues. The transmission of mails from one rural office to another is carried on by the same means. For the delivery of letters each office has attached to it the requisite number of peons or rural messengers; to each of these a separate circle is allotted, within which it is his duty to distribute the incoming letters so received from the Postmaster.\n\nHe is also furnished with a \"travelling letter-box,\" so that he may at the same time collect any letters intended for outward despatch.\n\nThe agency employed is of a mixed character, partly imperial and partly local. The imperial office at Sult\u00e1npur has been already mentioned; others were placed some years ago at Jagdispur and Dostpur, and others have recently been placed experimentally at Amethi and Mus\u00e1firkhana. All charges connected with these are met from the imperial revenues. The local agency consists of all but that just described; the income, from which the cost it entails has to be defrayed is derived from two sources\u2014viz., the special cess levied expressly for this purpose and a subvention\nfrom the imperial revenues computed on the number of police stations in\nthe district, the last remnant of the system which has now been superseded.\n\nStatement showing the number of articles received for delivery and\nthose returned undelivered during 1876-77:\n\n|                | Letters | Papers | Packets | Parcels |\n|----------------|---------|--------|---------|---------|\n| Given out for delivery | 28,667  | 470    | 39      | 1,010   |\n| Returned undelivered     | 2,654   | 37     | 2       | 20      |\n\nStatement showing the working of the district d\u0101k for 1876-77:\n\nNo. of miles of d\u0101k line 94,\nNo. of runners 30,*  \nCost for the year Rs. 3,037-6-9,\nNo. of covers delivered 27,493,\nNo. of covers returned undelivered 2,713,\nTotal No. of letters sent to district post-office 30,206.\n\n* Eight runners have worked for a part of the year.\nCHAPTER V.\n\nHISTORY.\n\nHistory\u2014Places of interest.\n\nEarliest Muhammadan settlement in this district.\u2014The history of Sultanpur need not here be carried back beyond the thirteenth century of our era. During this period it probably was that the first Muhammadan conquests were achieved, and the first Muhammadan colonies planted in the western portion of this district. From the tenure of the message sent to Sayyad S\u00e1l\u00e1r when he arrived in Satr\u00edchk it may be gathered that the princes of M\u00e1nikpur claimed dominions over the whole tract which intervened between their capital and Satr\u00edchk, nearly the whole of which, indeed, was afterwards included in the M\u00e1nikpur Sark\u00e1r, and the chronicles of J\u00e1\u00eds and Subeha towns which lay nearly on the line of march from one place to the other, point to the time of S\u00e1l\u00e1r Mas\u00e1\u00fad as that in which they were first visited by Muhammadans.\n\nSultanpur conquered by the Muhammadans.\u2014Sultanpur, in spite of the expeditions sent from Satr\u00edchk against Benares and other places to the east, appears for some unexplained reasons to have escaped the fate of its neighbours, J\u00e1\u00eds on the one side and Jaunpur on the other; it may have been that its naturally strong position baffled for the time all the attempts of the invaders. But be the cause what it may, the traditions current in its vicinity are singularly unanimous in omitting all mention of Sayyad S\u00e1l\u00e1r, and in representing the Bhars to have remained masters of it, until it was captured from them by Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn Ghori.\n\nAnd as part of Oudh under Muhammadan governors.\u2014This view is further supported by the fact that about this time the first mention is made of a Muhammadan governor (or Commander-in-Chief) in Oudh, being indeed, so far as I have been able to ascertain, the first instance in which allusion is made to that province by the Muhammadan historians. In relating the history of Muhammad Bakhtiar Khilji, the author of the Tabaqat-i-N\u00e1siri* says that \"this Muhammad Bakhtiar was a Khilji of Ghor of the province of Garms\u00edr. He was a very smart, enterprising, bold, courageous, and experienced man. He left his tribe and came to the court of Sultan Muizz-ud-d\u00edn at Ghazni, and was placed in the D\u00edw\u00e1n-i-arz (office for petitions), but as the chief of that department was not satisfied with him he was dismissed, and proceeded from Ghazni to Hindustan. When he reached the Court of Delhi he was again rejected by the chief of the D\u00edw\u00e1n-i-arz of that city, and so he went on to Budaon into the service of Hizabr-ud-d\u00edn Hasan, Commander-in-chief, where he obtained a suitable position. After some time he went to Oudh in the service of Malik His\u00e1m-ud-d\u00edn Ughlabak. He had good horses and arms, and he had showed much activity and valour at many places, so he obtained Sahlat and Sahli in j\u00e1g\u00edr.\"\n\nI have quoted this passage in extenso, because Muhammad Bakhtiar is himself credited by Elphinstone with the conquest of a part at least of Oudh, whereas from the above passage it looks as if he found the province\n\n* Ellioti's History of India, II., 305.\nunder a Musalman governor, or at least in the occupation of a Musalman army on his first arrival in it, and as if it was only by entering the service of the governor (who it may be remarked had been a companion of Qutb-ud-din in the Benares campaign, and had in its termination been immediately appointed to a governorship, that of Koil) that he obtained a base of operations for his subsequent incursions into Beh\u00e1r; at a later period he may certainly have held the province, as in the year A.D. 1202, \"he joined the auspicious stirrups and came to pay his respects from the direction of Oudh and Beh\u00e1r.\" After Muhammad Bakhtiar's unsuccessful attempt to establish an independent eastern empire, and the consequent restriction of his dominion to Bengal proper by Shams-ud-din Altamsh, the rest of the territory previously held by him was parcelled out into smaller jurisdictions, in which may be traced perhaps the outlines of those arrangements which were afterwards more fully elaborated in the Ain-i-Akbari. Among them Oudh became again a separate province; it was first held by Nasir-ud-din, elder son of Shams-ud-din, and in the next generation reference is made to a \"Hakim Oudh.\" The incumbent of the office being one Qazi Jalal-ud-din, and the recurrence of the title may be noted until after the accession of the Khilji dynasty.\n\nExtent of Oudh at this period.\u2014The Oudh here alluded to, it must at the same time be remarked, was very much smaller in extent than either the kingdom of Ram Chandar had been in early ages, or than the subah to which it subsequently gave a name; for contemporary with the Qazi Jalal-ud-din, above-named, Nasir-ud-din Mahmud, afterwards emperor; held the northern portion of the province which constituted the separate district of Bagraich, and in the opposite direction where Oudh marches with Manikpur their mutual boundary line most likely cut across the south-western corner of this district, excluding a large track from Oudh, and placing it in Manikpur.\n\nThese two governments being thus contiguous, the politics of the one were not unnaturally influenced by those of its neighbours, and it is not surprising to find that when Malik Jhajhu, a nephew of Ghayas-ud-din, rebelled against his Khilji sovereign in his government of Karra, Amir Ali,\u2020 his contemporary in Oudh, participated in the revolt. One of the immediate effects of the defeat of the confederates, which was speedily effected by the royal forces was the conferment of the government of Karra Manikpur by the emperor on his nephew, Al\u00e1-ud-din Khilji, who now first appears in the history of this district, and as he was chief among those whom the king delighted to honour, he soon became still more intimately connected with it by receiving a second grant, viz., of the government of Oudh, which had of course become vacant in consequence of the rebellion of Amir Ali.\n\nAl\u00e1-ud-din Khilji's two governments included the whole district.\u2014Al\u00e1-ud-din Khilji was thus the first Musalman governor under whose rule the two previously separate portions of the district were united,\u2021 but he is nevertheless completely ignored in the annals of all parts of it alike. Whether\n\n* Elliott's History of India, II., 344.\n\u2020 Also called H\u00e1tim Khan (Farishta).\n\u2021 Even then Chanda belonged to another government.\nrightly so or not is doubtful; for it has been suggested that to him* of right belongs the honour of the exploit which is ascribed to his namesake of the Ghori dynasty, which would make him the principal character in the principal event in the history of the capital. It would then, indeed, almost seem that the Khilji might pride themselves on having monopolised the annihilation of the Bhars of Sultanpur. A Khilji it was who dealt the first blow to their independence by the overthrow of Jais; for a Khilji has been claimed the honour of first conquering the region in which their principal possessions lay; a Khilji again is said to have demolished their last remaining citadel, and thus effected their complete subjection.\n\nBut I venture to think that it is quite possible the name has been correctly preserved as Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn Ghori, being as in the case of Jais, that of a person all but locally obscure; and that if, as is possible enough, the legend is inaccurate at all, it errs rather in the particular of confounding a private individual with a well known historical character than in that of substituting one distinctive designation for another; in the instance quoted that of Jais, it will be observed the very word Khilji, which is here supposed to have been merged in that of Ghori, is seen to have been retained unaltered. Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn, Khilji, moreover, so far as I have been able to ascertain from the sources of information at my command, does not appear to have once visited Oudh during the short period he was its governor, while it appears, after having been conquered by Musalman armies, to have been held by Musalman rulers, for nearly a century before his time, I have therefore told the tale as it was told to me, and assigned no more modern a date to the occurrences it narrates than historical probability absolutely demands, i.e., the reign of Shah\u00e1b-ud-d\u00edn.\n\nWhether Ghori or Khilji was the victor, the thoroughness of the conquest is evidenced in the most conclusive manner by the absence of any event connecting Sultanpur with general history, until the dismemberment of the Delhi empire in the time of Mahm\u00fad Tughlaq.\n\nSultanpur part of the kingdom of Jaunpur.\u2014Up to shortly before that period, the jurisdiction of the governor of Jaunpur had been limited to \"Jaunpur and Zafarabad,\" with such provinces to the eastward as were held neither by petty chiefs nor the lords of Lakhnauti;\u2020 but when in A.D. 1394, Mahm\u00fad Tughlaq deputed his Waz\u00edr, Khw\u00e1ja Jah\u00e1n, to that important charge, he invested him with the newly created title of Malik-ush-sharq, and at the same time extended his authority over the lower Du\u00e1b and the provinces on the left bank of the Ganges. When therefore later on in the same year, Khw\u00e1ja Jah\u00e1n, throwing off his allegiance to Delhi, assumed the emblems of royalty, Sultanpur found itself again, as in the time of Rama, in the centre of an eastern empire, very much the same in extent as Rama's, and at about the same distance, though in a different direction from the new capital as it was from the old one of Ajodhya.\n\nThe change of the sovereignty does not appear to have produced any marked effect on the even flow of its internal history, and Sultan Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm is, indeed, the only one of the Sharqi dynasty who lives in local story. In this he figures among the most ardent of the propagators of the faith of\n\n---\n\n* But he has no place in local tradition.\n\u2020 Calcutta Review, 1865, pargana Jaunpur.\nIsl\u00e1m, and as the indefatigable champion of the professors of that creed. That the tales told of him are exaggerated may be assumed;* but they are nevertheless pervaded by a vein of truth, and the reason for his being made the hero of them is not far to seek. Immediately after ascending the throne he had to hurry off from Jaunpur in the direction of Kanauj to join his army then encamped near the latter place on the left bank of the Ganges, and more than one march and countermarch between the two places is on record; so that it is quite credible not only that Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm himself actually passed the spots where there still lingers the recollection of his visit, but also that when he did so he had at his back forces sufficient in his estimation to cope with those of Delhi.\n\nEstablishment of the Mughal power.\u2014The downfall of the Jaunpur kingdom was no more actively felt in this part of Oudh than its erection; nor did anything of note occur within the half century of Lodi\u2020 rule. At the close of that period, however, B\u00e1bar, who had elsewhere established the Mughal power, marched in person into Oudh. Crossing the Ganges in the proximity of B\u00e1ngarmau, he marched by Lucknow eastwards, and encamped on the very day on which his General Ch\u00edn Taim\u00far Sult\u00e1n defeated the Afgh\u00e1n chief, by whom his power was contested in this province \u201ctwo or three kos above Oudh at the junction of the Gogar and Sirwa.\u201d Here he halted some days for the purpose of \u201csettling the affairs of Oudh and the neighbouring country and for making the necessary arrangements.\u201d \u2020This halt of B\u00e1bar\u2019s demands attention, as it was the proximate cause of one of the leading events in the history of the Bachgoti clan: the conversion to Isl\u00e1mism of Tilok Chand, nephew of the then chief of the clan,\u2021 whose descendants afterwards became premier r\u00e1jas of Oudh.\n\nThe S\u00far Kings.\u2014The temporary overthrow of the Mughal power, which occurred about ten years later, and the establishment of the S\u00far dynasty in the person of Sher Shah, must not be passed over in silence. They were fraught with results, material if not moral also, more important from a local point of view than any other of the numerous dynastic changes which had taken place since the fall of Delhi and Kanauj at the end of the twelfth century. Sher Shah had, soon after B\u00e1bar\u2019s death, made himself master of the province of Beh\u00e1r and of the important forts of Chun\u00e1r and Roht\u00e1s, and though from motives of prudence he bent for a time before the storm, and took shelter in the fortress of Roht\u00e1s when Hum\u00e1y\u00fan marched against him in A.D. 1538. No sooner did he find his army weather bound in Bengal than he issued from his retreat, took possession of Beh\u00e1r and Benares, recovered Chun\u00e1r, laid siege to Jaunpur, and pushed his detachments up the Ganges as far as Kanauj. So confident was he in the result of his future operations that at this period he\n\n---\n\n* They are more numerous in Rae Bareli, but are not altogether wanting in this district. Thus he is said by some accounts to have built a fort in Nasirabad, and another story states that Parshad Singh, the Kanhpuria chief, having attacked a Muhammadan tribe of that town, the Khat\u00edba, they appealed to and obtained the protection of Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm.\n\n\u2020 That is from the downfall of Jaunpur when the Lodi rule commenced in Oudh to the Mughal conquest.\n\n\u2021 The conversion is said to have taken place at Allahabad, so that it may not have happened till the following year, when B\u00e1bar\u2019s camp was pitched in this place; but it is improbable, as he only halted there for a few hours.\nassumed the title of king. In A.D. 1539 he inflicted a decisive defeat on Humayun who fled to Delhi, and was occupied there for eight or nine months in repairing his losses, and during that interval his conqueror contented himself with retaining his acquisitions in Hindustan, recovering possession of Bengal, and putting all his former territories into order. The renewal of hostilities still found him on the east of the Ganges opposite Kanauj. It is not immaterial to add that he had been accompanied throughout all these transactions by his son Salem Shah, who distinguished himself as a soldier in his father's wars; and was an improver like his father, but in public works rather than in laws.\n\nThe genuineness of the instances of Sher Shah's and Salem Shah's active interference in the affairs of this quarter of Oudh may, therefore, be unhesitatingly admitted. Tilok Chand, the Bachgoti Musalman convert, was now dead; but his grandson, Hasan Khan, is said to have managed to ingratiate himself with Sher Shah, and so to have carried still further that aggrandizement of his family which his grandfather had commenced; and as an example is ready at hand in Sher Shah himself of the success which might speedily be achieved by soldiers of fortune in such unsettled times ready credence may be yielded to the statement.\n\nCareful of the interests of his followers, Sher Shah was no less so of his own; and for the more effectual protection of the latter, he is said, under the influence perhaps of his son's taste for public works, to have ordered the simultaneous erection of fifty-two substantial fortresses.* The ruins of many of these still exist; some of them are to be identified no doubt with the forts of burnt brick noticed in the Ain-i-Akbari. This fact corroborates in an important manner the statement made by Elphinstone, that \"Akbar's revenue system though so celebrated for the benefit is conferred on India, presented no new invention, but was in fact only a continuation of a plan commenced by Sher Shah, whose short reign did not admit of his extending it to all parts of his kingdom.\"\n\nRestoration of the Mughal power.\u2014The restoration of the Mughal power by Humayun might remain unnoticed had not his son Akbar left his famous institutions. In the systematic division of the empire into subahs, of subahs into sarkars, and of sarkars again into muhals, which they gave rise to, Oudh was selected to furnish a name at once to one of each of those divisions.\n\nSultanpur in Akbar's time.\u2014Sultanpur formed one of the constituent muhals of the Sarkar of Oudh, and so of course lay in the subah of that name. Neither the Sultanpur muhal, however, nor the Sarkar, nor even the subah of Oudh included the whole of the tract known more recently by the name of Sultanpur. What has been vaguely and inferentially remarked regarding an earlier period, may be regarding the time of Akbar more definitely and certainly repeated, viz., that the whole of the eastern and much of the southern and western portions of the present district belonged not to Oudh, but to the sarkars of Jaunpur and Manikpur in the subah of Allahabad.\n\n* A similar tale is current in Bas Bareli, but the forts are attributed to the Sharqi dynasty. As Shergarh and Salemgarh are said to be two of them, I think the Sur dynasty is the more probable.\nMany of Akbar's muh\u00e1ls admit of early and certain identification with parganas of the present time, but with regard to others there is ample room for doubt, and I therefore give in full three out of the four sark\u00e1rs just named as described in the \u00c1fn-i-Akbari, together with what I believe to be their modern representatives. The Jaunpur sark\u00e1r is shown by Sir H. Elliot to have contained Ch\u00e1nda only belonging to Sultanpur, and it will therefore be sufficient to give so much of it as relates to that pargana.\n\n**Sarkar Oudh, 21 muh\u00e1ls.**\n\n| Number | Muh\u00e1ls of the \u00c1fn-i-Akbari. | Parganas of the present day. | Present districts (according to arrangements of 1869.) |\n|--------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| 1      | Oundh b\u00e9 haweli, 2 muh\u00e1ls... | Haweli Oundh                   | Fyzabad.                                            |\n| 2      | Ambodha                      | Ambodha                       | Basti.                                              |\n| 3      | Ibr\u00e1himabad                  | Ibr\u00e1himabad                   | Bara Banki.                                         |\n| 4      | Inhanna                      | Inhanna                       | Rao Bareli.                                         |\n| 5      | Pachh\u00edmr\u00e1th                 | Pachh\u00edmr\u00e1th                   | Fyzabad.                                            |\n| 6      | Bilahri                      | Sultanpur Baraunsa (alias Bilahri.) | Sultanpur.                                          |\n| 7      | Basorhi                      | Basorhi                       | Bara Banki.                                         |\n| 8      | Th\u00e1na Bhad\u00e1on*               | Tappa Asl                     | Sultanpur.                                          |\n| 9      | Baktha                       | Baksha                        | Bara Banki.                                         |\n| 10     | Daryabad                     | Daryabad                      | Ditto.                                              |\n| 11     | Rudanli                      | Rudanli                       | Ditto.                                              |\n| 12     | Sallik                       | Sallik                        | Ditto.                                              |\n| 13     | Sultanpur\u2020                   | Sultanpur                     | Sultanpur.                                          |\n| 14     | S\u00e1thanpur\u2021                   | Jagd\u00edspur                     | Ditto.                                              |\n| 15     | Sab\u00e9hs                       | Sab\u00e9hs                        | Bara Banki.                                         |\n| 16     | Satr\u00edkh                      | Satr\u00edkh                       | Ditto.                                              |\n| 17     | Sirwap\u00e1l\u00a7                    | Ams\u00edn                         | Fyzabad.                                            |\n| 18     | Guw\u00e1r\u00edch                     | Guw\u00e1r\u00edch                      | Gonda.                                              |\n| 19     | Kishn\u00ed\u00a7                      | Jagd\u00edspur                     | Sultanpur.                                          |\n\n* There is still a village called Bhad\u00e1on in pargana Tappa Asl. It formerly gave its name to a tappa which is said to have been in pargana Sultanpur, and both these remarks are equally applicable to Tappa Asl. Both th\u00e1na Bhad\u00e1on and Tappa Asl are very small, and the prevailing clan in both is the same, the Bachgotl. I hence infer that th\u00e1na Bhad\u00e1on was the old name of Tappa Asl.\n\n\u2020 The old pargana is now divided into two parts, separated by the river Gumti, and called Sultanpur Baraunsa and Sultanpur Mir\u00e1npur:\n\n(a).\u2014Sultanpur Baraunsa is the present name of Bilahri pargana, or rather of part of it; it continued to be a separate pargana until annexation, and was composed of two sil\u00e1s of which Baraunsa was one and Gudara or P\u00e1p\u00e1r Gh\u00e1t the other. The junction of the names of the two parganas is not altogether new. Professor Blochmann tells me that \"the Muhammedans histories often mention Sultanpur Bilahri, where the battle was fought.\" Regarding this battle see his \u00c1fn-i-Akbari's translation, p. 400.\n\n(b).\u2014Sultanpur Mir\u00e1npur, Mir\u00e1npur or rather Moranpur Kathot, modern name of the old Kathot pargana. The change occurred when the tahsildar's quarters were removed from one place to another. The Sultanpur and Mir\u00e1npur parganas were separate until after the mutiny; the latter was then absorbed in the former, and its name was disused for a time, but revived and combined with that of Sultanpur on the reorganization of districts in 1869.\n\n\u2021 S\u00e1than or S\u00e1tanpur continued to be a separate pargana until 1750 when it was united with Kishn\u00ed, and a single new pargana, Jagd\u00edspur, which still exists, superseded them both.\n\n\u00a7 The change of name took place in 1763; see pargana Ams\u00edn.\n\n\u2020 See S\u00e1tanpur. Kishn\u00ed still survives as a large qasba and postal town.\n| Number | Muh\u00e1ls of the \u00c1\u00edn-i-Akbari | Parganas of the present day. | Present districts according to arrangement of 1869. |\n|--------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| 1      | Bhitauli                  | Bhitauli                      | Bara Banki.                                       |\n| 2      | Dewa                      | Dewa                          | Ditto.                                            |\n| 3      | Kumbhi*                   | Ditto                         | Ditto.                                            |\n| 4      | Kursi                     | Kursi                         | Ditto.                                            |\n| 5      | Kahanjra\u2020                 | Ditto                         | Ditto.                                            |\n| 6      | Siddhaur                  | Siddhaur                      | Ditto.                                            |\n| 7      | Sidhipur                  | Ditto                         | Ditto.                                            |\n| 8      | Bilgram                   | Bilgram                       | Hardoi.                                           |\n| 9      | Garanda                   | Ditto                         | Ditto.                                            |\n| 10     | Hardoi                    | Hardoi                        | Ditto.                                            |\n| 11     | Kascha Ando               | Kachhandan                    | Ditto.                                            |\n| 12     | Mallanwan                 | Mallanwan                     | Ditto.                                            |\n| 13     | Sandila                   | Sandila                       | Ditto.                                            |\n| 14     | Amethi                    | Amethi                        | Lucknow.                                          |\n| 15     | Bijnaur                   | Bijnaur                       | Ditto.                                            |\n| 16     | D\u00e1dra\u2021                    | Ditto                         | Ditto.                                            |\n| 17     | Deor\u00e1kh                   | Deor\u00e1kh                       | Ditto.                                            |\n| 18     | Lucknow b\u00e1 Haweli         | Lucknow                       | Ditto.                                            |\n| 19     | Mari\u00e1son                  | Ditto                         | Ditto.                                            |\n| 20     | Mahona                    | Mahona                        | Ditto.                                            |\n| 21     | Malhabad                  | Malhabad                      | Ditto.                                            |\n| 22     | Sande                     | Siasaindi                     | Ditto.                                            |\n| 23     | K\u00e1kori                    | K\u00e1kori                        | Ditto.                                            |\n| 24     | Gh\u00e1tampur                 | Gh\u00e1tampur                     | Unao.                                             |\n| 25     | Halhar\u00a7                   | Ditto                         | Rae Bareli.                                       |\n| 26     | Tara Singhana             | Ditto                         | Unao.                                             |\n| 27     | Nisgarbh                  | Ditto                         | Rae Bareli.                                       |\n| 28     | Pahrimau\u00b6                 | Ditto                         | Ditto.                                            |\n| 29     | S\u00e1thapur                  | Khiron                        | Ditto.                                            |\n| 30     | Sih\u00e1li                    | Ditto                         | Bara Banki.                                       |\n| 31     | B\u00e1ri                     | B\u00e1ri                          | Sitapur.                                          |\n| 32     | Manwi                     | Manw\u00e1n B\u00e1ri                   | Ditto.                                            |\n| 33     | Garh Amethi**             | Amethi                        | Sultanpur.                                        |\n| 34     | Isauli                    | Isauli                        | Ditto.                                            |\n\n* Kumbhi is given as one of the twenty-two Bais parganas in Chronicles of Oonso, page 67.

In the reign of Shah Jah\u00e1n the parganas of J\u00e9is and Amethi were held as j\u00e1gir by Ahmad Beg Khan, nephew of N\u00e1r Jah\u00e1n (Professor Blochmann's \u00c1\u00edn-i-Akbari's translation, para. 609), but whether Garh Amethi is here intended I cannot say. In later times this pargana belonged to M\u00e1nikpur Sark\u00e1r, how or when it came to do so is not clear. If it is the one Ahmad Beg Khan held, the change may have taken place then. It may have been separated from its old Sark\u00e1r when it became his j\u00e1gir, and have been thrown when he gave it up into the Sark\u00e1r, to which J\u00e9is the remainder of the j\u00e1gir belonged, which was M\u00e1nikpur. In Hindi p\u00e2s\u00ee the name of the pargana is often preceded or followed by the expression \"R\u00e2ja Hej\u00fbr;\" but the meaning of the first word I cannot ascertain.\n### Sarkar Lucknow.\u2014(concluded.)\n\n| Number | Muh\u00e1ls of the \u00c1in-i-Akbari | Parganas of the present day | Present districts according to arrangement of 1869 |\n|--------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| 36     | As\u00edwan                    | As\u00edwan                      | Unao.                                            |\n| 37     | Ascha                     | Ascha                       | Ditto.                                           |\n| 38     | B\u00e1ngarmau                 | B\u00e1ngarmau                   | Ditto.                                           |\n| 39     | Farosi *                  | Sikandarpur                 | Ditto.                                           |\n| 40     | Fatehpur                  | Fatehpur                    | Ditto.                                           |\n| 41     | Fatehpur Chaur\u00e1s\u00ed         |                             | Ditto.                                           |\n| 42     | Harha                     | Harha                       | Ditto.                                           |\n| 43     | Jhalotar                  | Jhalotar                    | Ditto.                                           |\n| 44     | Mukraid \u2020                 | Magr\u00e1yar                    | Ditto.                                           |\n| 45     | Maur\u00e1nw\u00e1n                 | Maur\u00e1nw\u00e1n                   | Ditto.                                           |\n| 46     | Moh\u00e1n                     | Moh\u00e1n                       | Ditto.                                           |\n| 47     | Panhan                    | Panhan                      | Ditto.                                           |\n| 48     | Parsandan                 | Parsandan                   | Ditto.                                           |\n| 49     | P\u00e1tan                     | P\u00e1tan                       | Ditto.                                           |\n| 50     | R\u00e1mkot                    |                             | ...                                              |\n| 51     | Ranbhirpur\u2021               | Purwa                       | Unao.                                            |\n| 52     | Saipur\u00a7                   | Saipur                      | Ditto.                                           |\n| 53     | Sarwan                    | Sarwan                      | Ditto.                                           |\n| 54     | Un\u00e1n                      | Unao                        | Ditto.                                           |\n| 55     | Unchgaon||                | Daundia Khera              | Ditto.                                           |\n\n* See Chronicles Oonso, p. 57.\n\n\u2020 Village of name still exists (commonly pronounced Magr\u00e1yar) near Harhs.\n\n\u2021 See Chronicles Oonso.\n\n\u00a7 See Chronicles Oonso, p. 25.\n\nThis pargana and those of Sidhipur and Tara Singha were formed into one about a century ago under the name of Daundia Khera by R\u00e1o Mardan Singh, ancestor of the notorious rebel B\u00e1bu R\u00e1n Bakhsh of the taluqa of that name.

The change of name took place seven generations ago, when Part\u00e1b Singh, fixing his residence at a place till then known as R\u00e1mpur, built a great fort, and giving it his own name, changed the name of the pargana from Aror to that of Partabgarh.\n\n\u2020 Jal\u00e1ipur Bilkhar was the old name of Patt\u00ed Dalippur pargana. It was at the same time the name of a single estate, a partition of which took place ten generations before 1780 A.D., or soon after Akbar\u2019s time. Two smaller estates were then formed and called Dalippur and Patt\u00ed, and from this division the two estates, so called, began a separate existence. (Mr. R. M.

They are now partly in the Bih\u00e1r and Salon tahsils in the Rae Bareli district, and partly in the Partabgarh tahsil is the district of that name. They were like \"Gus\u00e1ra,\" assigned villages. Their name derived from \"P\u00e9eg\u00e1h\" a stable, indicates the purpose of their assignment; their revenues were devoted to the defrayment of expenses connected with the purchase and maintenance of the royal cattle (du\u00e1b). The existence of such a grant in the locality may very possibly be due to the circumstance mentioned by the Emperor B\u00e1h\u00e1r in his memoirs, that in the 16th century there were thirty or forty villages in Karra M\u00e1nikpur, the inhabitants of which were exclusively employed in catching elephants. Professor Blochmann thinks it probable that the \"old Pathan Sult\u00e1ns kept the elephants there that came up from Purwa.\" These Qari\u00e1t P\u00e9eg\u00e1h had their own kashahr\u00eds in the village of Juir and their own Q\u00e1n\u00fangos, whose descendants are still called \"P\u00e9eg\u00e1hw\u00edla.\"\n\n\u2020 The revenue of the Bhilwal pargana was until the reign of \u00c1sif-ud-daula paid at N\u00e1g\u00e1ram, now in the Mohanlalganj tahsil, in the Lucknow district. In 1787 the residents of that place having made frequent complaints of the violence and oppression of the military force stationed there, the Chakladar, Haidar Beg Khan, removed the tahsil office to Fatehgarh where he built a fort and called it after himself Haidargarh. From this time the old name of Bhilwal began to be displaced by that of Haidargarh. Bhilwal is still a large village, a collection of 11 hamlets.\n\n\u2021 This pargana continued to retain its old name up to the end of native rule. Sultan Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Sharq\u00ed built a fort in the village of Thulendi, and this continued to be the residence of officials until Shuj\u00e1-ud-daula's time. R\u00e1ja Niw\u00e1s Singh, the then N\u00e1s\u00edm, appropriated to his own private use an estate of which Thulendi was the village, and in consequence deemed it prudent to transfer his official residence to the neighbouring village of Bachhr\u00e1w\u00e1n. This led to Bachhr\u00e1w\u00e1n being selected, on the annexation of the province, as the headquarters of a tahsil, and the name of the jurisdiction attached to it was simultaneously altered to bring it into accordance with the actual state of things.\n\n\u00a7 J\u00e1s is one of a very few parganas which have been broken up into several smaller ones since the time of Akbar. Its dismemberment has in great measure followed the course of history of the Kanpurias. That is commenced before A.D. 1715 is manifest from the mention of Simrants in a treaty of that year. Since the re-arrangement of pargana boundaries after re-occupation there has been no separate pargana of the name of J\u00e1s. The one which contains the old eponymous city is now called Rokha J\u00e1s, and comprises portions of the old parganas of J\u00e1s and Nasirabad.\nSark\u00e1r M\u00e1nikpur\u2014(concluded.)\n\n| Number | Muh\u00e1ls of the \u00c1\u00edn-i-Akbari | Parganas of the present day | Present districts according to arrangement of 1869 |\n|--------|---------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| 11     | Qari\u00e1t-i-Guz\u00e1ra*          | ...                        | Rae Bareli.                                      |\n| 12     | Nasirabad\u2020                | Rokha                      | Ditto.                                           |\n| 13     | Kathot                    | Mir\u00e1npur                   | Sultanpur.                                       |\n\n* The word qari\u00e1t is familiar in a somewhat different form to European scholars; it forms the first part of the word Carthage, and, says Professor Blochmann, \"occurs also in many biblical names.\" The word guz\u00e1ra means \"maintenance.\"\n\nThe whole expression \"Qari\u00e1t-i-Guz\u00e1ra\" is variously explained. According to one account, it signified villages assigned to the king's private servants; according to another, villages of which the revenues were allowed for \"Aind ravind,\" or expenses incurred in entertaining royal messengers or public servants passing through M\u00e1nikpur. These villages were 262 in number, but few of their names are now known. They are now partly in the Bih\u00e1r and partly in the Salon tehsils in the Rae Bareli district. They had their own kuchabhrs (in Karetha and Bih\u00e1r) and their own q\u00e1unngo's. The present q\u00e1unngo of the Partabgarh pargana belongs to the family of the old \"guz\u00e1ra\" officials.\n\n\u2020 The name of Nasirabad has now been superseded by that of Rokha. The latter continued to be the name of a separate pargana until annexation.\n\nSark\u00e1r Jaunpur Muh\u00e1ls.\n\n| Number | Muh\u00e1ls of the \u00c1\u00edn-i-Akbari | Parganas of the present day | Present districts according to arrangement of 1869 |\n|--------|---------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| 1      | Ch\u00e1nda*                   | Ch\u00e1nda                     | Sultanpur.                                       |\n\n* Ch\u00e1nda appears to have been detached from the Jaunpur Sark\u00e1r by the treaty of 1775 A.D. At the same time its size was reduced to the separation of taluqa Singhr\u00e1man, which remained in that Sark\u00e1r. According to local accounts the way it happened was that the Taluqdar of Singhr\u00e1man rendered good service to the British Government, and in return got his estate taken under its sheltering wing. A more probable explanation is that taluqa Singhr\u00e1man was the only part of pargana Ch\u00e1nda included in Balwant Singh's estate which formed the extent of the British acquisitions under that treaty. (See Aitchison's Treaties.)\n\nSultanpur under the Nawab Wazirs' dynasty.\u2014Sultanpur continued to be divided between the subahs of Allahabad and Oudh for about two centuries, or until the time of the Nawab Wazirs. The circumstances connected with the establishment of that dynasty throw some little light on the state of affairs in Sultanpur at that period.\n\nSa\u00e1dat Khan, the founder of the line, was rewarded for his good services to the crown with the Subahdarship of Agra; and in that post proved himself to be possessed of considerable administrative ability. In the meantime Oudh was in a state verging on rebellion; and foremost among the\nrefractory was the ancestor of one of the principal landholders of this district, Mohan Singh, the Kanhpuria R\u00e1ja of Tiloi, who had been in a chronic state of opposition to the local rulers; and appears to have been attempting to convert his private estates into an independent principality. Intelligence of this reached Delhi, and the Emperor deemed it prudent to transfer Sa\u00e1dat Khan to Oudh. The new governor at once adopted vigorous measures for the restoration of tranquillity. He first endeavoured to induce the R\u00e1ja of Tiloi to make peaceful submission, but that chief turned a deaf ear to his advice, and he was at last obliged to march against him. Sa\u00e1dat Khan\u2019s army consisted of but ten thousand men, while that of Mohan Singh was just five times as numerous. Mohan Singh, however, was defeated and slain, and the other chiefs having lost their leader speedily tendered their allegiance.\n\nNow, as in the time of Akbar, the possessions of the Kanhpurias brood as they are stretch no further north and east than the old mub\u00e1l of J\u00e1is did.* It would thus appear that Sa\u00e1dat Khan\u2019s subah had been enlarged at the expense of that of Allahabad. On the contrary, what brought Mohan Singh into collision with Sa\u00e1dat Khan was that he claimed as his, and sought to annex to his estates in M\u00e1nikpur, Inhauna and other par-ganas belonging to Oudh, and thus owed fealty to Sa\u00e1dat Khan as well as the Subahdar of Allahabad, although he withheld it impartially from both. Again, with J\u00e1is on the west and with Ch\u00e1nda on the east, Sa\u00e1dat Khan had no concern. It was not till this reign that they ceased to be a subject to a separate Government,\u2020 when Safdarjang after engaging in a civil war with his sovereign consented to make peace on condition that he should be invested with the double Subahdari of Oudh and Allahabad.\u2021\n\nWhether the names of Oudh simultaneously received and extended meaning is uncertain, probably not: for the inheritance of Safdarjang was divided and Allahabad and Oudh were separately held awhile by Shuj\u00e1-ud-daula and Muhammad Quli Khan. The integrity of the Allahabad subah did not commence to be threatened until Shuj\u00e1-ud-daula was compelled, under the treaty of A.D. 1765, to cede the sark\u00e1s of Allahabad and Karra to the emperor, and as the subah was thus lopped of the part from which it derived its name, it is possible that what remained assumed the designation of the province to which it continued to be attached. But this dismemberment was only temporary; and the Nawab Waz\u00edr recovered Allahabad and Karra (Rohilkhand being added to them) by the treaty of A.D. 1775. I think it is doubtful therefore whether J\u00e1is, Ch\u00e1nda, and Kathot came to be considered part of Oudh proper until the Subah of Allahabad was finally broken up in the reign of Sa\u00e1dat Ali Khan, when a great part of it was ceded to the English.\n\nIn Sa\u00e1dat Ali Khan\u2019s time.\u2014This cession by Sa\u00e1dat Ali Khan of a portion of his dominions was made with a view to insuring the better management of the remainder. One of the measures adopted in order to\n\n* It, indeed, in Akbar\u2019s time they extended so far, for J\u00e1is was then held by various tribes (Aqw\u00e1m Mukhtalif).\n\u2020 Their union with Oudh under Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn was temporary only.\n\u2021 Elphinstone, 4th Edition, p. 651.\ngive effect to that purpose was a complete reorganization of jurisdiction. The old and half obsolete arrangement of subahs and sarkars was formally abolished, and the province was divided into nizamats and chaklas* which continued to exist until the introduction of British rule. The importance of Sultanpur was now on the increase. Nizamats each comprised about a quarter of the province, and Sultanpur was selected to give its name to one of them. In its widest sense it now signified a tract extending from the Gogra on the north to the British district of Allahabad on the south and from Jagdispur on the west to the boundary of the province on the east.\n\nHere then for the third time in its history Sultanpur is found a political and religious landmark; of the west the emblem was the crescent, of the east the cross. The masses of the people, indeed, in both directions were of the same persuasion. Brahmanism with them still reigned supreme. The distinction lay between the governing races not the governed; on the west lay the kingdom of the Muhammadan and Asiatic, the vassal of the Emperor of Delhi, on the east lay the possessions of the Christian and European subject to the presidency of Bengal. The nizamats were subdivided into chaklas, which however it was practically if not theoretically at the option of the n\u00e1zm to disregard. Separate officers were usually appointed to each chakla under \"am\u00e1n\u00ed\" n\u00e1zims, but otherwise only occasionally. An explanation of this difference was once offered to me in the naive remark that it entailed too great an expenditure to find much favour with revenue farmers\u2014a pretty instructive comment on one of the evils of the contract system.\n\nThe Sultanpur nizamat contained four chaklas, viz., 1 Sultanpur, 2 Aldemau, 3 Jagdispur, 4 Partabgarh.\n\nSubjoined is a list of the N\u00e1zims of Sultanpur from the date of the institution of the office until the annexation of the province.\n\n| No. | Name                        | Years          |\n|-----|-----------------------------|----------------|\n| 1   | Mirza Satt\u00e1r Beg            | 1793 to 1793   |\n| 2   | S\u00edl\u00e1t Parsh\u00e1d               | 1794           |\n| 3   | R\u00e1ja Niw\u00e1s Singh            | 1801           |\n| 4   | Mirza J\u00e1n\u00ed                  | 1803           |\n| 5   | R\u00e1ja Jagal Kishor           | 1806           |\n| 6   | R\u00e1ja Niw\u00e1s Singh            | 1808           |\n| 7   | Fazl Ali Khan               | 1811           |\n| 8   | Mir Khuda Bakhsh            | 1812           |\n| 9   | Mir Ghul\u00e1m Hus\u00e9n            | 1812           |\n| 10  | Ikram Muhammad Khan         | 1815           |\n| 11  | Mir Ghul\u00e1m Hus\u00e9n            | 1818           |\n| 12  | T\u00e1j-ud-d\u00edn Hus\u00e9n Khan       | 1824           |\n| 13  | R\u00e1ja Darshan Singh          | 1828           |\n| 14  | Mehdi Khan                  | 1835           |\n| 15  | Mirza Abdulla Beg           | 1836 to 1838   |\n| 16  | Qutb-ud-d\u00edn Hus\u00e9n Khan      | 1837           |\n| 17  | R\u00e1ja Darshan Singh          | 1838           |\n| 18  | Mirza Saf-shikan Khan       | 1840           |\n| 19  | Ata-ulla Beg                | 1841           |\n| 20  | Shekh Hus\u00e9n Bakhsh          | 1841           |\n| 21  | W\u00e1j\u00edd Ali Khan              | 1842           |\n| 22  | T\u00e1j-ud-d\u00edn Hus\u00e9n Khan       | 1843           |\n| 23  | R\u00e1ja Inchha Singh           | 1843           |\n| 24  | Qutb-ud-d\u00edn Hus\u00e9n Khan      | 1845           |\n| 25  | R\u00e1ja M\u00e1n Singh              | 1845           |\n| 26  | W\u00e1j\u00edd Ali Khan              | 1848           |\n| 27  | Agha Ali Khan               | 1850           |\n\nAnnexation.\u2014Towards the beginning of 1856 Oudh was annexed to the British Empire. \"The revolution was accomplished without the shed-\n\n* Perhaps I should rather say constructed nizamats out of the previously existing chaklas, for the latter was no new division. Mr. C. A. Elliott (Chronicles of Oonao, p 127) attributes the introduction of nizamats to Safdarjang, but the popular view of the question in this district is that it was due to S\u00e1d\u00e1t Ali Khan, and so it is in the neighbouring district of Rae Bareli. It is certainly against the supposition that nizamats were not formed until after the treaty of 1801, that the list of n\u00e1zims commences at an earlier date. But considering how commonly n\u00e1zims and chakladars are used as synonymous, it is very possible that one or two officials of the latter degree have been added to make the list commence with the fa\u00e1l\u00ed century. 1793 A.D. is equivalent to 1800 fa\u00e1l\u00ed.\nding of a drop of blood, even where difficulty and danger was apprehended everything was quietly and prosperously accomplished. The Oudh troops were peacefully disbanded, receiving from the British Government, in addition to their arrears of pay, either a gratuity or a pension, if they were not, as a large number were, drafted into a new irregular force in the service of the company. The people generally gave no sign of discontent. A few of the tradesmen at the capital, and others who had profited by the licentious profession of the court, declared their attachment to the royal family; but if beyond this there was any regret at the extinction of the old dynasty of Oudh, there was no intelligible expression of feeling. The new system of administration which was applied to Oudh was identical with that which had been found by experience to work so well in the Panjab. A mixed commission of soldiers and civilians was appointed with Sir James Outram at its head, and it was soon said that the disorganized and distracted kingdom of Oudh was fast subsiding into a tranquil, well ordered province of the British Empire.\"* But the calm was a deceitful one as was shown by the outbreak in 1857.\n\nThe following account of the mutiny at Sultanpur is taken from \"Gubbins' History of the Mutinies in Oudh\":\n\n\"Mutiny.\u2014The station of Sultanpur was commanded by Colonel S. Fisher, whose regiment, the 15th Irregular Horse, was stationed there. Besides it there were the 8th Oudh Irregular Infantry commanded by Captain W. Smelt, and the 1st regiment of Military Police under Captain Bunbury. Apprehending an outbreak of the troops, Colonel Fisher sent off the ladies and children on the night of the 7th June towards Allahabad under care of Dr. Corbyn and Lieutenant Jenkins. The party reached Paratagarh safely, but there they were attacked and plundered by the villagers. Three of the ladies\u2014Mrs. Goldney, Mrs. Block, and Mrs. Stroyan, with their children\u2014were separated from the rest, and were taken to the neighbouring fort of Lai Madho Singh at Garh-Amethi, where they were very kindly treated. Madho Singh sent us in their letters to Lucknow, furnished them with such comforts as he could procure himself, and took charge of the articles which we wished to send; and after sheltering the ladies for some days forwarded them in safety to Allahabad. The rest of the party, joined by Lieutenant Grant, Assistant Commissioner, found refuge for some days with a neighbouring zamindar, and were by him afterwards escorted in safety to Allahabad.\n\n\"The officers who remained at Sultanpur were less fortunate. The troops rose in mutiny on the morning of the 9th of June, when Colonel Fisher, in returning from the lines of the Military Police, whom he had harangued and endeavoured to reduce to order, was shot on the back by one of that regiment with a musket-ball. The wound was mortal, and Fisher was attended in his last moments by the Adjutant of the corps, Lieutenant C. Tucker. The troopers of the regiment would not come near their Colonel; but neither did they injure him. They, however, attacked and killed the second in command, Captain Gibbings, who was on horseback near the\n\n* Murray's History of India, p. 724.\ndooly in which Fisher lay. The men then shouted to Lieutenant Tucker to go; and finding it useless to attempt to stay longer he rode off, and crossing the river found shelter in the fort of Rustam Sah, at Dera, on the banks of the Gumti. There, he was joined next day by Captain Bunbury of the Military Police, and Captain W. Smith, Lieutenant Lewis, and Dr. O'Donel, of the 8th Oudh Irregular Infantry. Information was sent into Benares of their escape, and they were brought in by a native escort, which was immediately sent out by the Commissioner of Benares, Mr. H. Carre Tucker.\n\n\"Rustam Sah is a fine specimen of the best kind of taluqdars in Oudh, of old family, and long settled at Dera. He resides there in a fort very strongly situated in the ravines of the Gumti, and surrounded by a thick jungle of large extent. It had never been taken by the troops of the native Government, which had more than once been repulsed from before it. Rustam Sah deserves the more credit for his kind treatment of the refugees, as he had suffered unduly at the settlement, and had lost many villages which he should have been permitted to retain. I had seen him at Fyzabad in January, 1857, and after discussing his case with the Deputy Commissioner, Mr. W. A. Forbes, it had been settled that fresh enquiries should be made into the title of the villages which he had lost, and orders had been issued accordingly. It is singular that Rustam Sah and Lal Hanwat Singh, in the Salon district, who had both been severe sufferers by the settlement proceedings, should have distinguished themselves by their kindness to British officers.\n\n\"Thus perished Samuel Fisher, a man well known in India, where he had many friends and no enemies. A keen sportsman, a splendid rider, he excelled in every sport of the field, while his kind and loving disposition endeared him to all who knew him. Until the day before his death I had been in daily communication with him, conveying and receiving intelligence. On the 10th of June no post arrived from Sultanpur, and we too surely guessed the cause.\n\n\"Besides Colonel Fisher and Captain Gibbings, two young Civilians were unhappily also slain\u2014Mr. A. Block, C.S., and Mr. S. Stroyan. When the mutiny broke out, they crossed the river and took refuge with one Yasin Khan, zamindar of the town of Sultanpur. This man at first welcomed them, but afterwards most basely betrayed them. He turned both officers out of his house, and then caused them to be shot down. This is the only instance of like treachery on the part of a petty zamindar in Oudh which came to our notice.\n\n\"After getting rid of the European officers the mutineers sacked and burned their houses. The three regiments then marched for Lucknow. On the way, however, they heard of the discomfiture of the 3rd regiment of Military Police, which was on its march from Lucknow to meet them, and turning to the right took the road to Daryabad. Thence they proceeded on to Nawabganj, Bara Banki, which by the 27th June became the rendezvous of all the mutineers in Oudh.\"\nThe following is an account of some of the clans in this district:\n\n**The Tiars.**\u2014The Tiars are now nearly an extinct race, but at one time it is said that the lords of the Sultanpur pargana were all Tiars. They succeeded the Bhadaiy\u00e1ns, the conquerors of the Bhara, and were in turn overcome by the Bachgotis, whose star is at present in the ascendant. This order of succession is chronicled in the following doggerel lines:\n\n```\nBhar m\u00e1r Bhadaiy\u00e1n ;\nBhadaiy\u00e1n m\u00e1r Tiar ;\nTiar m\u00e1r Bachgoti.\n```\n\nThe Tiars gave their name to one of the old subdivisions of the pargana, viz., Tappa Tiar, and this perhaps rather than the entire pargana was the extent of their domains. At present they have nothing more than a right of occupancy in a few acres in their old tappa. Regarding the Tiars very little is known. Mr. Carnegy considers them to belong to the Solar race; * they themselves say they are descended from emigrants from Baisw\u00e1ra, who received a grant of the Bhadaiy\u00e1n's territory from the R\u00e1ja of Benares. Nor is much assistance to be gained from their name. Local accounts say they built a fort in the village Terai, and made it their headquarters, but Harkpur is usually considered to have been their principal village. Phonetic resemblance might suggest their connection with Tirhoot or Tirabhakti, especially as their reference to the R\u00e1ja of Benares points to an eastern origin \u2020 but on the other hand, Thornton mentions an influential class called Tiars \u2021 in Malabar, and I forbear therefore to offer any conjecture as to what their name denotes or what ethnological relationship it indicates.\n\n**The Raghubansis.**\u2014The Raghubansis profess to be the lineal descendants of Raghu, an ancestor of Rama. There are two colonies of them in this district\u2014one in Simrauta, the other in Sultanpur, but neither of them is of much importance at the present time. The Raghubansis of Simrauta, once possessed half that pargana, which they say they obtained from some Muhammadan king for some unknown reason at some unknown period of antiquity. They were robbed of their independence more than three centuries ago, and few of them now remain.\n\nThe Raghubansis of Sultanpur claim to have been settled in their present abodes ever since the time of their eponymous ancestor. For centuries they resisted the threatened encroachments of the Bachgotis, and maintained intact a frontier marked by a little nameless affluent of the Gumti. It was not till within the half century of disorder and misrule which preceded the annexation of the province that they succumbed; and even now though in a subordinate position, they retain no small portion of their ancient heritage.\n\n**The Bais.**\u2014There is scarcely a pargana in this district in which at some period or another, a Bais colony has not been established. In Simrauta, before it was overrun by the Kanhpurias, they shared the proprietorship with the Raghubansis; in Ch\u00e1nda stories yet linger of their having interven-\n\n---\n\n*Notes on races, p. 27.\n\u2020 Unless, indeed, one of Jai Chandr\u00e1's line be referred to.\n\u2021 In connection with this circumstance, note the Southern origin of the Bais, with whom the Tiars of Sultanpur, claim kindred.\ned between the Bhars and the Rajwars; in Amethi the Bais of Udiawan still retain some vestiges of their former rights; the Bais of Gandeo are still the most extensive proprietors in Inhauna and Subeha; the Bhale Sultans of Isuli and Jagdispur claim descent from the redoubtable Tilok Chand.\n\nThe Bais of Simrauta.\u2014The Bais of Simrauta claim to have received fifty-four villages in that pargana in dowry with a Chauhan bride from Prithi Raj of Delhi; but as the fortunes of the Kanhpurias rose their's declined; and they are now reduced to the possession of a couple of villages, though a few of them may also be found scattered here and there in cultivation of lands they have now ceased to own.\n\nThe Bais of Udiawan.\u2014The Bais of Udiawan profess to trace their descent from Tilok Chand, but I have searched in vain for any point of agreement between their pedigree and that of the Bais of Baiswara. Bijai Singh, their ancestor, they say who lived when the days of Bhar rule were drawing to a close, married a Bachgoti girl of Asl and, when taking her home to Baiswara, broke his journey at Udiawan, in the Amethi pargana, then the headquarters of an estate of forty-two villages belonging to Brahman Lakhandar Pande. Bijai Singh was a favourite disciple of this Lakhandar, who being childless induced him by a promise of heirship to render his stay permanent. In due time he succeeded his Gamaliel, and on his death left his estate to his three sons\u2014Son Singh, Bharat Singh, and Rathi Singh\u2014by whom it was divided into three parts (thoks) Sonari, Bhareta, and Tengha. How long the dominion of the Bais continued over Udiawan is uncertain, but it is now held by the Bandhalgotis, and it is the general belief, corroborated by the Ain-i-Akbari,* that it was one of their very earliest conquests effected many centuries ago. The Raj of Amethi, indeed, denies that his tribe was preceded by the Bais at all, and says they were settled in the pargana by one of his ancestors from whom they received a large jagir for military service.\n\nThey still occupy many villages in the Udiawan ilaka, but their proprietary interest in it is now greatly circumscribed.\n\nThe Bais of Gandeo.\u2014About four hundred years ago a body of Bais, under the leadership of Bariar Sah, set out from Gahumanj (supposed to be somewhere in the Muzaffarnagar district) in quest of a new home. The greater part of Northern India had by that time passed into the hands of Chhattis, and the Bais wandered to the neighbourhood of Inhauna and Subeha before they came to a place which would satisfy the object of their expedition. Here in a tract called Gandeo, containing three hundred and sixty villages, they discovered an ignoble community of Bhars and Dhobis still in the enjoyment of independence. The name, supposed to mark the spot where the famous bow Gandiva was dropped in his flight by one of the defeated heroes of the great war, suggested reflections full of interest to the Hindus, and thus practical and sentimental considerations\n\n* That is to say, the Bais are not there mentioned as zamindars, and the Bandhalgotis are, which means that if the Bais had ever (as is usually believed) been independent zamindars, they had already ceased to be so.\nconcurred in prompting the adventurers to select this as their abode. The reduction of the Bhars and Dhobis was speedily accomplished and the victors have since been known as the Bais of G\u00e1ndeo, Gar\u00e9u, or Garhai. This commences and at the same time almost ends their history, the only other event in it worthy of notice being that in the reign of Sher Shah, Bharat Singh's great-grandson of Ban\u00e1r S\u00e1h embraced the Muhammadan faith.*\n\nThe Bharoivans.\u2014This name is simply a corruption of the word Bhainsaulian, or natives of Bhainsaul, whence the clan derives its origin. While the Bais of Gandeo were still at Gah\u00fam\u00fanj, Jaip\u00e1l Singh, son of Jagat Singh, Chauh\u00e1n, was chief of Bhainsaul, in the Mainpuri pargana. He married a daughter of the Gab\u00fam\u00fanj family, and the issue of this marriage was a son, Karan Singh, who, with a band of followers, joined the expedition of Ban\u00e1r S\u00e1h. Shortly after the location of the Bais colony in G\u00e1ndeo he married the daughter of one of their chiefs, Tip\u00far, R\u00e1wat; and there being no sons to stand in his way, succeeded to his father-in-law's estate consisting of forty-two villages. Karan Singh had two sons, R\u00e1o and Kunwar, the former of whom died childless, and the latter had two sons, B\u00e1z Singh and J\u00edt Singh. J\u00edt Singh died without issue, and B\u00e1z Singh received the title of Kh\u00e1n-i-Azam Bhainsaulian. His conversion is reputed to have taken place in the reign of Sher Shah, and his descendants are manifestly the Chauh\u00e1n-i-nau Muslim alluded to in the \u00c1\u00edn-i-Akbari as occupying the Inhauna pargana. Fateh Bah\u00e1dur Khan, a descendant of B\u00e1z Singh, still possesses a taluqa Bhowa, consisting of twenty-four villages.\n\nMandarkyas.\u2014The Mandarkyas describe themselves as Sombansi, descendants of a chieftain, Kishan Chand, the founder of the town Kishni. Mandala, they explain in the Sanskrit language, signifies an area of sixty-four kos or one hundred and twenty-eight miles, and such was the extent of Kishan Chand's domains. He was hence styled Mandalak, or lord of a Mandala, and his descendants Mandalakya, or by contraction Mandarkya. But the word Mandala does not appear to possess the particular meaning here attributed to it; it signifies any region or country, and in that sense is of not unfrequent occurrence, as Kosambi Mandala, Chala Mandala, and Garha Mandala; but by itself, it is altogether meaningless.\n\nI venture to offer another derivation of the name, which has at least the recommendation of simplicity. The common pronunciation of the name is Mararkya, but it has just been seen that according to the people themselves the first r is an instance of the common colloquial practice of substituting that letter for nd, and Mandarkya is the more correct orthography. They imply also that kya is a terminal affix only, and that the radical portion of the name is m\u00e1ndar. It is true they make kya an accumulation of two simpler affixes kand yas, but this difficulty is disposed of by the fact that they do not always use this combination, as\n\n* Mr. Benett (Chief Clans of Rao Bareli, page 24) places this event in the reign of Humayun, which is much the same thing.\noften calling themselves Mandarakas as Mandarkyas. Now M\u00e1ndar S\u00e1h is the name of one of their ancestors second only in importance to Kishan Chand himself, and this verbal coincidence leads me to think that the Mandarkyas take their name from their ancestor, M\u00e1ndar S\u00e1h, just as the Tilokchandi Bais are called after their ancestor Tilok Chand.\n\nThe Mandarkyas are partly Musalmans and partly Hindus; the conversion of the former was attributed to the time of Sher Shah. Their apostacy does not seem to have bettered their worldly prospects, for none of them even acquired large estates. Hindus and Musalmans together, they now hold but four villages, and the family is in the last stage of decay.\n\nPlaces of interest.\u2014The following are the few places of interest the district possesses:\n\nGanaur.\u2014Ganaur, pargana Isauli. In this village are the ruins of what must once have been a vast structure. For a wonder, though its history is unknown, it is not ascribed to the Bhars. The single fact I have been able to ascertain about it is that it was the house of an oilman. The ruins consist of some massive walls of masonry of immense thickness, and three or four pagoda shaped buildings of proportionately substantial construction. The latter are ornamented with beautifully executed scroll-work engraved or rather moulded in the external surface of the bricks; a portion of the design only is contained in each brick so that to complete it two or more have to be placed in a particular position\u2014a work of no small difficulty when they are once separated. In the roof of one of the buildings is a large spherical cavity, in which the oilman is supposed to have hoarded his vast wealth to protect it from the rapacity of his neighbours. Who this mysterious individual was, whither he went, how he disappeared, or when he lived, no one seems to know.\n\nBikhar.\u2014Bikhar, pargana Ch\u00e1nda. This village is said to take its name from the great Vikramaditya, Bikram\u00e1j\u00edt, or Bikram. On the border of one of the tanks in it is a statue said to be that of the legendary hero, and worshipped by the people of the village. The head of it only is now visible, and even that is said to be gradually disappearing. This is possible enough, and may be traced to natural causes, but this is too simple for rustic superstition, which discovers supernatural agency at work. Vikramaditya is said to be sinking into the earth with horror at the depravity of modern days. As to the reason for the erection of the statue in the village accounts are discrepant. One says it marks the scene of a battle in which Vikramaditya lost his life; another that it commemorates an exploit of a devotional character. A certain faq\u00edr by way of showing his veneration for Bhaw\u00e1ni cut off his head, and presented it as an offering to that goddess. So unusual an act of piety deserved an appropriate reward at her hands, so she caused the head to return to his shoulders, and presented him with a buffalo-load of gold. The faq\u00edr distributed the gold in charity, and repeated the same ceremony every day with the same satisfactory result. Bikramaditya heard of this and his\n\n* According to the Hindus, moreover, the name of one of their clans Chalukya is formed by the addition of the termination *kya* to *chalu* (see \"Chronicles of Oonao,\" page, 56.).\nenterprising spirit at once prompted him to attempt the feat. He was no less successful than the faqir, and the statue is intended to bear witness to the circumstance.\n\nArjunpur.\u2014Arjunpur, pargana Chanda. Here are remains of a large fort built by Salem Shah; it long ago ceased to be occupied, and little more than the foundations now exist. The walls are about three feet thick with bastions here and there, and enclose a large area now under cultivation. The fort is said to have been called Makarkala and to have given name to the still existing village of Sarae Makarkala from a bazar at which place the inmates of the fort obtained their supplies.\n\nArju.\u2014Arju, pargana Chanda. This village contains a brick well, said to have been in existence since the time of the Bhars. Here, too, are found large bricks nearly two feet in length, which are said to have formerly held a place in the walls of one of those Bhar forts, of which we hear so much and see so little. It is the only one of the kind to which I need allude under this head; numbers of them are said to have existed in every pargana, but with a few exceptions nothing is known about them, so that an enumeration of their names would be tedious and unprofitable.\n\nKothot.\u2014Kothot in pargana Sultanpur. The popular account of Kothot is that after the capture of Kushbhawanpur by Ala-ud-din Ghori the Musalmans erected two fortresses. The principal one was Sultanpur on the north of the Gumti on the site of Kushbhawanpur; the other a kind of outpost, was built a few miles from it on the south side of the river. Hence the latter came to be called by the Sultanpur garrison Kot-ut, or the fort on the other side, and Kothot is simply a corruption of the name so formed.\n\nThis derivation may be nonsense; but nevertheless Kothot is a place of undoubted antiquity. The remains of its old fort are still shown in a mound on the borders of the village of Jurapatti, and it gave its name to a pargana in the time of Akbar. It is not at all improbable therefore that it was occupied by Muhammadans as early as the time of Ala-ud-din, the conqueror of Sultanpur.\n\nSULTANPUR Pargana\u2014Tahsil Sultanpur\u2014District Sultanpur.\u2014This pargana lies along the south bank of the Gumti; its natural features are described under the district heading. It is rather a dreary and dry expanse of country with no large towns except Sultanpur; it is intersected with ravines stretching down to the Gumti. It has an area of 246 square miles and a population of 159,225, being at the rate of 644 to the square mile. The most numerous class of the community is the Brahman numbering 22,879; this may perhaps be accounted for by the soundness of the bank of the Gumti along which in this quarter it is believed that no less than 360 temples are to be found. Withal the Brahmans have only managed to get ten villages in the pargana. The Chamars come next numbering 19,829. The Bachgoti Chhattirs are the principal landholders owning 190 villages. The Khansadas who are converted Bachgotis come next with 130, and the annals of these clans may here be given.\nThe landed property is divided between the following clans to the following extent:\n\n| Clans          | Taluqdar\u012b | Zamindar\u012b |\n|----------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Bachgotis      | ...       | 94        | 96        |\n| Rajkum\u0101ras     | ...       | 30        | 8         |\n| Kh\u0101nz\u0101das      | ...       | 111       | 19        |\n| Musalmans      | ...       | 0         | 13        |\n| Brahmins       | ...       | 0         | 10        |\n| K\u0101vathas       | ...       | 0         | 15        |\n| Other castes   | ...       | 3         | 2         |\n\nTotal: 238 163\n\nThe Bachgoti Kh\u0101nz\u0101das of Hasanpur.\u2014Jai Chand Singh's posterity have played a conspicuous part in local history, the head of the family for the time being is still acknowledged premier r\u0101ja in this part of Oudh. Tilok Chand, son of Jai Chand, says tradition, was a contemporary of B\u0101bar, during one of whose eastern expeditions he laid the foundation of the future greatness of his house. Either taken prisoner in battle, or arrested as a refractory landholder, Tilok Chand fell a prisoner into B\u0101bar's hands. He was allowed to choose between the adoption of the faith of Isl\u0101m with immediate liberty, or adherence to his old religion with incarceration for an indefinite period. With many respectable precedents to guide him, he selected the former alternative, and was thereupon received into the emperor's favour.* His name was changed to T\u0101t\u0101r Khan, and with it he received the title of Kh\u0101n Bah\u0101dur, or Kh\u0101n-i-\u0100zam.\n\nT\u0101t\u0101r Khan had three sons. One Fateh S\u0101h, whose descendants still hold the Dhamaur il\u0101qa, was born before his father's conversion, and retained the name Bachgoti; the others, Bazid Khan and Jal\u0101l Khan, were brought up as Muhammadans, and from their father's title coined themselves the new and pretentious name of Kh\u0101nz\u0101das.\n\nOf Bazid Khan nothing but the name is known; but his son, Hasan Khan, attained to greater eminence than any other member of his family, and in his time the prosperity of the Kh\u0101nz\u0101das reached its culminating point. Sher Shah,\u2020 it is said, during his progress from Bengal to Delhi chanced to make a lengthened halt at Hasanpur, or as it was then called Narmal, the headquarters of Hasan Khan, who following the policy inaugurated by his grandfather of seeking advancement through the medium of court favour, welcomed his distinguished visitor with a sumptuous banquet, worthy of the rank to which he was aspiring, and, indeed, had recently assumed. Sher Shah was much gratified at this mark of attachment and respect; and Hasan Khan having now placed his foot on the ladder of fortune, soon mounted higher and higher.\u2021\n\n* I here follow local tradition, but Sir H. Elliott says the Kh\u0101nz\u0101das must have been converted before the Mughal dynasty commenced, as we read of Bachgotis with Musalman names before that (Supplementary Glossary, Bachgoti). Perhaps the conversion was indirectly connected with the turbulence already mentioned in Sikandar Lodi's reign.\n\n\u2020 It may be noted that this is another of the periods during which the Bachgotis distinguished themselves by their turbulence.\n\n\u2021 Elphinstone, 4th Edition, page 388, Sher Shah assumed the title of king before he had conquered his way as far west as Kanauj.\nOne day at court a question arose between the R\u00e1ja of Riwa and Hasan Khan, the latter boldly asserting his precedence, the former as positively rejecting his pretensions. \"How far then,\" said Sher Shah, \"do your vast territories extend? \"whose but mine,\" promptly answered Hasan Khan, \"is the very ground on which your majesty's residence stands?\"* Sher Shah amused at the quick reply, placed Hasan Khan beside him, and said that he should be thereafter styled co-monarch\u2020 at the same time delegating to him the favour to confer the title of raja on whom he pleased within the limits of Banaudha. And this last was by no means a barren honour, for theoretically at least during the investiture, the king-maker stands upon a costly dais, which is constructed of a lac and a quarter of rupees at the expense of the raja elect, and the ceremony over becomes the perquisite of the occupant.\u2021\n\nHowever gratifying these tokens of favour to the recipient, they were not likely to extinguish the dispute between him and his rival; and it was agreed that the question at issue should be referred to the arbitrament of the sword. Hasan Khan conscious of his inability to cope single-handed with his antagonist at once set himself diligently to work to obtain allies. With the Chauh\u00e1ns of Mainpuri he appealed to clan feeling and the ties of kindred, and argued that it was incumbent upon them to strain every nerve to establish the Chauhan's superiority over the Baghels, to Musalman chiefs he pointed out the merit of making common cause with him, a convert to their faith, against the unbeliever, and by such means as these soon succeeded in collecting a vast army. This he led to the appointed rendezvous; but the R\u00e1ja of Riwa shirked the conflict, and failed to put in an appearance on the ground.\n\nThe Kh\u00e1nz\u00e1da accordingly returned in triumph, and rose yet higher in the favour of Sher Shah. In the midst of a courtier's life, Hasan Khan found leisure to pay considerable attention to his interests as a landholder. Not only did he found the present village of Hasanpur, but the estate which thence derives its name is said to have seen its palmiest days while it was in his possession. It may, indeed, be surmised that the overthrow of the S\u00far dynasty caused him to retire into private life, for he is said to have died at Hasanpur. A little to the north of the Lucknow road, on the west of that town, may be seen a brick-built enclosure of massive construction. In its present dilapidated condition it might be mistaken for the ruins of a small castle, but it was built by Hasan Khan as a family mausoleum, and his remains are said to have been the first deposited there.\n\nThe mantle of Hasan Khan does not appear to have fallen upon any of his successors; but there are signs that each of them, according to his\n\n* \"P\u00e1\u00e9 takht b\u00e1dsh\u00e1 kis ke r\u00e9j men hai?\" It must be remembered that at this time Sher Shah chanced to be at Hasanpur, which appears to give point to the joke.\n\u2020 B\u00e1dsh\u00e1 doem Masnad-i-\u00c1la. The last words are vulgarly corrupted into \"Masan-Delhi.\"\n\u2021 Dr. Butter (Southern Oudh, page 150) says that the R\u00e1ja of Hasanpur is the descendant of the R\u00e1ja of Banaudha, the last of whom gave his daughter in marriage to \"Ghori B\u00e1dshah.\" Dr. Butter takes this person to be Qutb-ud-din Ghori, but Sher Shah also claimed to be a Ghori (Elliot 4th edition, pages 384 and 816 note) and the title of B\u00e1dshah only commenced with B\u00e1bar. Is it then possible that Sher Shah is the Ghori B\u00e1dshah of the story, and that Hasan Khan was the raja who gave his daughter to him? This would fully account for Hasan Khan's good fortune.\nability, strove to maintain the honour of the family. Nor did they allow such considerations as kinship to interfere with the pursuit of this object. Fateh S\u00e1h's line had in the fourth generation that had elapsed since its commencement, done its best to struggle into importance, and had annexed among others a little il\u00e1qa known as the \"twelve kanait villages.\" Upon these Zabardast Khan of Hasanpur cast covetous eyes, and at last he determined to take possession of them.\n\nHe accordingly attacked them with a large force, and in the internecine strife which followed, much Bachgoti blood was spilled on both sides. Zabardast Khan remained master of the coveted tract, but to obliterate the recollection of the events connected with its acquisition directed that the name of the village which had been the scene of conflict, Kanait itself, should be no longer used, and it should be for the future replaced by Shahpur. In yet another family quarrel did Zabardast Khan figure about the same time, but an account of it will be more properly given under the history of Mani rpur which is just afterwards given.\n\nRoshan Ali Khan son of Zabardast Khan was the first to permanently injure the fair edifice which Hasan Khan had reared. At the outset of his career, indeed, his power was equal to that of his predecessors, and it might have remained so to the last, had he not rashly ventured to measure strength with Safdarjang. He was killed in a battle with the Nawab, and the importance of the Hasanpur family thereby sustained a serious blow.* At that time their estate was in danger of being altogether broken up; as for the next thirty years during the nominal incumbency of Ali Bakhsh,\u2020 adopted son of Roshan Ali Khan, it was held under direct management by the officers of Government. Ashraf Ali succeeded Ali Bakhsh; but for five years afterwards a similar state of affairs continued, and it was not until A.D. 1809 that he obtained full control over his estate. This he retained for ten years only when he died leaving two sons, Husen Ali and Khair\u00e1t Ali, both of whom afterwards ascended the gaddi.\n\nUntil Husen Ali reached his majority (in 1830), Hasanpur was again held under direct management; in the following year he was admitted to engage for it, and thereafter continued to do so until annexation with the exception of a short break in 1837-38, the date\u2021 of which suggests that it may have been in some measure due to the circumstances described in the following story:\u2014Husen Ali was in 1836, when the circumstances referred to occurred, about twenty-five years of age, and an extensive zamindar holding much of the land which lies between his residence and Jagd\u00edspur.\n\n* Elliott's Supplementary Glossary. Bachgoti, where Roshan Ali is called Diw\u00e1n, \"but\" says Sir H. Elliott, most people deny the right of the Hasanpur Bandhua family to the title of Diw\u00e1n, which they say belongs only to the Bilkharia family, and in practice it is certainly usual to give the title to the latter. (The present Hasanpur title is raja.)\n\n\u2020 After Roshan Ali's death his widow, Bibi Jamayyat Kh\u00e1nam, obtained a farman granting her the Bh\u00e1da Il\u00e1qa, forty-two villages, rent-free. They were resumed by Sa\u00edd\u00e1t Ali Khan in 1798.\n\n\u2021 It may be added also that the name of the Government manager, Sher Ali, is the same as that of Husen Ali's adversary.\nIt being known that his mother, who resided at Dh\u00faa, a fort lying about a mile south of his residence, Hasanpur, cohabited with a neighbouring zamindar named Sher Ali, and the father of her son-in-law, Husen Ali resolved to put her to death, and one night attempted to execute his intention by setting fire to her residence, which he had surrounded with his armed followers. In the smoke and confusion she escaped, with her daughter and another female relative through an unguarded breach in the wall of the fort, and fled on foot to the cantonment of Sultanpur as the nearest place of safety. Neutrality in all private quarrels being deemed essential to the security of the British cantonments in Oudh, she was at first refused admission within the boundary pillars, but was ultimately smuggled into the regimental bazar, whence she was on the point of being ejected, and would have been murdered by her son had not Sher Ali opportunely come up with 300 matchlockmen and carried her off. Husen Ali subsequently made another attempt on her life, and got near enough to hack her p\u00e1lki with his sword, but she again escaped, and is now in a fort near Sikraura with Sher Ali, who abandoned his kot (small fort) Jaisingarh, twelve miles north-east of Sultanpur, with his villages, to Husen Ali, who was expected to take possession of them at the expiration of the financial year (20th June, 1837).\n\nDuring the mutiny Husen Ali took an actively hostile part against the English; he was present at the battle of Sultanpur (22nd March, 1858), when he commanded the infantry of the rebel army; he was accompanied by his son, who lost his life in the battle. Not having so compromised himself however as to be excluded from the benefit of the general amnesty, he was on re-occupation maintained in possession of his estate. He died in November, 1860, and the inheritance devolved on his brother Khair\u00e1t Ali, who was followed in 1869 by his son Muhammad Ali, the present raja.\n\nThe Bachgoti Kh\u00e1nz\u00e1das of Mani\u00e1rpur.\u2014Bah\u00e1dur Khan, fifth in descent from T\u00e1t\u00e1r Khan, had two wives. By the first marriage he had issue, Ism\u00e1il Khan, and by the second, Hay\u00e1t Khan and Dalel Khan. Some accounts state that the two latter received an il\u00e1qa (Mani\u00e1rpur) containing one hundred and nine villages as their share of the Hasanpur estate, while others contradict this statement. It seems probable either that they attempted to assert their right to a share but without success, or that they obtained one and were almost immediately ousted. It is at least certain that bitter enmity prevailed between Hay\u00e1t Khan and Zabardast Khan, grandson of Ism\u00e1il Khan, and that no other cause of quarrel is recorded; that Hay\u00e1t Khan was killed by Ism\u00e1il Khan, and that both Hasanpur and Mani\u00e1rpur remained in the hands of the latter.\n\nHay\u00e1t Khan left six sons, Daria Khan and five others. Shortly after his death, Daria Khan and one or two of his brothers went by night to Hasanpur, determined to take vengeance on the murderer of their father, and stealing quietly into his fort found him alone and fast asleep. They now drew near to kill him, but repenting suddenly of their design they spared his life; at the same time to show how far it had been in their power, they took up his turban, sword, and slippers which were lying by his side, and left their own instead. When he awoke in the morning\nZabardast Khan found no difficulty in identifying his midnight visitors, and was deeply moved by their generous forbearance. Determined now to put an end to his feud with them he set off for Daria Khan's house in Maniarpur, and to show his appreciation of the chivalrous character he had displayed went unattended. Daria Khan seeing him approach fled precipitately into the neighbouring jungle; but Zabardast Khan, resolved not to have his good intentions thus frustrated, sought an interview with Hay\u00e2t Khan's widow. Having related to her the events of the preceding night, he urged that Daria Khan had already exacted a noble and sufficient vengeance for his father's death, inasmuch as he had had the culprit's life in his hands, although his natural sense of honour had forbidden him to play the part of an assassin. By these and similar arguments he gained the widow over to his cause, and by her intercession a reconciliation was effected with her sons also. Daria Khan took up his residence at Hasanpur, and was entrusted with the management of the entire estate; and at the same time, in conjunction with his brothers, received a grant of eleven villages for his support. These villages formed the nucleus of the present Maniarpur taluqa. They received considerable additions even in the time of Daria Khan, who took advantage of his influential position to enlarge his boundaries whenever the opportunity occurred; but at his death, which happened about 1743 A.D., a partition took place among his sons and brothers, and the separate properties thus formed became small and unimportant. The majority of them were re-united by Roshan Zam\u00e1n Khan, who could show a rent-roll of Rs. 3,50,000; and it was in his time that the consequence of Maniarpur commenced.\n\nRoshan Zam\u00e1n Khan died in 1818, and was followed by his brother Bas\u00e1wan Khan, who survived him but two or three years. Maniarpur then came into the possession of B\u00edbi Rahm\u00e1ni; it received several important accessions by what to European notions seems rather curious means. She is said to have intended to make the chakladar, M\u00edr Ghul\u00e1m Husen, her heir, and he was fully aware of that interesting fact. He accordingly first handed over to her several villages in the Sultanpur pargana in which her estate lay; and afterwards not content with this, began to draw upon the neighbouring parganas of Tappa Asl and Isauli, simultaneously altering the boundary line between them and Sultanpur. Under such auspices there is no knowing to what extent Maniarpur might not have increased, but its prosperity received a sudden check by the untimely (or perhaps many thought timely) death of M\u00edr Ghul\u00e1m Husen; and B\u00edbi Rahm\u00e1ni deprived of her protector appears to have fallen among thieves; for it was in her time that the Gargbansi, of whom General Sleeman says so much, first obtained a footing in the estate. Immediately after Bas\u00e1wan Khan's death in 1821 A.D., B\u00edbi Rahm\u00e1ni made Nih\u00e1l Singh, \"Gargbansi of Sehipur, manager of her affairs. From the time that he entered upon the management, Nih\u00e1l Singh began to increase the number of his followers from his own clan, the Gargbansi, and having now become powerful enough he turned out his mistress; and took possession of the estate in collusion with the local authorities.\"\n\n*Sleeman's Tour through Oudh, I., 142. The following account of the Maniarpur estate is in great measure taken from this work; but partly also from local sources.*\nIn this he was not unopposed, for R\u00e1ja Darshan Singh who held the contract for the district interfered\u2014not as might be expected in his official capacity, and for the protection of B\u00edbi Rahm\u00e1n\u00ed, but because he wished to take advantage of the occasion to seize upon the estate for himself. Unable, however, as a public servant of the state to lead his own troops openly against his rival, he was compelled to secure the co-operation of a powerful Taluqdar, B\u00e1bu Bari\u00e1r Singh of Bhiti, in the execution of his schemes. Nih\u00e1l Singh was killed in a night attack by Bari\u00e1r Singh (1832), but Harp\u00e1l Singh his nephew was ready to take his place and continue the struggle at once; even while Darshan Singh was in office, he held possession of the greater part of the disputed property, and when another n\u00e1zm\u00ed was appointed (1834), he recovered the remainder, still pretending to hold it for the rightful owner B\u00edbi Rahm\u00e1n\u00ed. In 1835 B\u00edbi Bas\u00e1o, widow of Bas\u00e1wan Khan, succeeded to the estate; but Harp\u00e1l Singh, with great pertinacity, continued to force his services upon her until 1838, when Darshan Singh, a second time n\u00e1zm\u00ed, at last proved too strong for him. Next year B\u00edbi Bas\u00e1o resigned in favour of B\u00edbi Sughra, who in 1843 managed to get the estate transferred from the jurisdiction of the contractor for Sultanpur to that of the Haz\u00far Tahsil, and so held it till 1845. M\u00e1n Singh, who then had the contract got it restored to his jurisdiction, and put it in charge of his own officers, until, in the following year having collected the greater part of the revenue due on it, he made it over to Harp\u00e1l Singh and Shiumbar Singh, who put its owner into confinement, and plundered her of all she had left.\n\nB\u00edbi Sughra now summoned to her aid Rustam S\u00e1h and other R\u00e1jkum\u00e1r landholders, friends of her late husband. A fight ensued in which Shiumbar Singh and his brother, Hobd\u00e1r Singh, were killed, and Harp\u00e1l Singh fled to his fort at Khapr\u00e1dh. B\u00edbi Sughra escaped and fled to Lucknow, whence she got orders issued to M\u00e1n Singh and all the military authorities to restore her to the possession of her estate and seize or destroy Harp\u00e1l Singh. The death of the latter occurred soon after, and the Gargbans\u00eds then relinquished their hold upon Mani\u00e1rpur; and though they subsequently, with the connivance of a revenue farmer, secured some portion of it for themselves, their connection with the so called management of it finally terminated on the death of Harp\u00e1l Singh. In 1847 M\u00e1n Singh was superseded in the contract by W\u00e1jid \u00c1li Khan who was commissioned by the Darb\u00e1r to reinstate B\u00edbi Sughra, and brought her with him from Lucknow for the purpose. Soon afterwards, however, he made over part of her estate to his friend B\u00e1qar Ali of Issuli, and another part to R\u00e1msar\u00fap, son of Shiumbar Singh, for a suitable consideration, and left one half only to B\u00edbi Sughra. After no little hesitation she agreed to accept this on condition that the revenue demand upon it should be considerably reduced, but not only was no remission made, but she was required by the n\u00e1zm\u00ed to pledge all the rents to Husen Ali Khan, the commandant of a squadron of cavalry on detached duty under him. B\u00edbi Sughra again appealed to the influence of her friends at Court, and orders were reiterated for the restoration of the whole of her estate, but W\u00e1jid Ali Khan completely disregarding them made over or sold several villages to Raghubar Singh, brother of M\u00e1n Singh, who killed B\u00edbi Sughra's agents in the manage-\nment, plundered her of all her property, and all the rents which she had up to that time collected for payment to Government, and took possession of the villages transferred to him. W\u00e1jid Ali soon after came with a large force, seized the lady, and carried her off to his camp and refused all access to her. At last when she became ill, and likely to sink under the treatment she received, he made her enter into a written engagement to pay to the troops, in liquidation of their arrears of pay, all that he pretended she owed to the state, and handed her over to Ghaf\u00far Beg, a commandant of Artillery, in whose hands she fared much the same as in those of W\u00e1jid Ali Khan.\n\n\u00c1gh\u00e1 Ali, who superseded W\u00e1jid Ali in 1849, directed that martial law should cease in Man\u00ed\u00e1rpur, but Ghaf\u00far Beg and his artillerymen were too much for him, and refused to give up possession of so nice an estate, which in spite of all the usurpations and disorders it had suffered, still possessed a rent-roll of a hundred thousand rupees a year. At this time in the fortunes of unlucky B\u00edbi Sughra, General Sleeman made his tour through Oudh, and on hearing of his approach, Ghaf\u00far Beg moved off with his captive to Chandauli, where she was treated with all manner of indignity and cruelty by the artillery. The Resident represented the hardship of her case to the Darb\u00e1r with a consciousness, at the same time that there was a very slender chance of her obtaining redress. She recovered her liberty at last in 1851, and after surviving all her troubles and misfortunes died at a good old age in 1866. She left her estate by will to B\u00e1bu Akbar Ali Khan who has since died, and a female Taluqdar, B\u00edbi Il\u00e1hi Kh\u00e1n\u00e1m, his widow, again holds Man\u00ed\u00e1rpur.\n\nThe Bachgoti R\u00e1jkum\u00e1rs.\u2014When R\u00fap Singh emigrated from Bilkhar to Dikhiali, his brother, \u00c1sre Singh, ancestor of the R\u00e1jkum\u00e1r Bachgotis, settled a little further to the east, in the same pargana in the village of P\u00farai B\u00e1gh R\u00e1e. Almost immediately, however, he moved to Bhadayy\u00e1n which standing in the midst of ravines and jungles perhaps recommended itself as a suitable position for a fort, and here the headquarters of the R\u00e1jkum\u00e1rs have since remained.* The next event in the history of his house is its colonization of trans-Gumti territory. Bijai Chand, eighth in descent from \u00c1sre Singh, had four sons\u2014Jamayyat R\u00e1e, Jiu Narain, Jalip R\u00e1e, and Harkarandeo. Jamayyat R\u00e1e remained in Bhadayy\u00e1n, the others led colonies across the Gumti, whither they were followed in the two succeeding generations by Hari R\u00e1e son, and Madkar S\u00e1h, a grandson of Jamayyat R\u00e1e. \u201cIt is believed to be about 250 years since the offspring of Bari\u00e1r Singh, having become too numerous to find room on the right bank of the Gumti, and powerful enough to encroach on the property of their neighbours, crossed over to the left or Fyzabad bank, and by degrees established six colonies.\u201d Further allusion to these would be a work supererogation on my part, the more so that a full account of them may be found in Mr. Carnegy\u2019s printed Aldemau Report.\n\nThe house of Bhadayy\u00e1n has little history that would repay perusal. It had the ordinary petty encounters with its neighbours, but none of them\n\n* The R\u00e1jkum\u00e1rs, who are said to be descended from R\u00e1j Singh, i.e., the same son of Bari\u00e1r Singh as the Bachgotis of Sultanpur, adjoin them and separate them from their more distant kindred the R\u00e1jkum\u00e1rs.\nhave been of sufficient interest to merit any detailed notice. An exception may perhaps be made in favour of the siege and destruction of the Bhaday\u00e1n fort, which took place between thirty and forty years ago. This fort was defended by the then taluqdar Shuday\u00e1l Singh against two chakladars, both of whom fell during the siege. It was at last destroyed by the British troops under Colonel Faithfull, but rebuilt by Shuday\u00e1l Singh's son, Shankar Bakhsh, and maintained by him in 1836 against the chakladar, who at length took and demolished it.*\n\nThe term Rajkum\u00e1r is commonly applied to the junior branches of all houses in which a r\u00e1j exists; and thus there are Rajkum\u00e1r Bais, and Rajkum\u00e1r Kanhpuria as well as Rajkum\u00e1r Bachgotis. And the only explanation I have heard of the last named being so called is in accordance with this, viz., that it is to distinguish them from their brethren the Rajw\u00e1rs, who could once pride themselves on their chief being a r\u00e1ja. They are the only ones, however, with whom this distinction has superseded the broader appellation of the clan.\n\nThe Bachgoti Rajw\u00e1rs.\u2014Though confined to narrower limits than their kinsmen of the time of Raj S\u00e1h, Ghunghe Singh's descendants, occupying as they do the greater portion of pargana Ch\u00e1nda, are still entitled to take rank among the principal families of the district. Ghunghe Singh had three sons, Gaj Singh, Ghanp\u00e1l Singh, and Harp\u00e1l Singh, the first and last of whom kept their old name of Bachgoti, and obtained lands in the Partabgarh district to which their history belongs. Ghanp\u00e1l Singh had two sons, R\u00e1md\u00e9o and Garabdeo; from the former spring the Kh\u00e1nz\u00e1des of Moraine, the latter is the ancestor of all the Hindu Rajw\u00e1rs. I have not yet explained this cognomen; it would not have been an anachronism, indeed, to apply it to any generation yet mentioned, for it originated only with Jamnibh\u00e1n, a son of Garabdeo.\u2020 Jamnibh\u00e1n is said to have been distinguished both for martial prowess and intellectual ability, and by a judicious use of these rare gifts, to have considerably extended the already large possessions of the Bachgotis. With the unanimous consent of his connexions he assumed the title of r\u00e1ja, and his immediate relations in consequence of the dignity they borrowed from the circumstance were thenceforward styled \"Rajw\u00e1rs.\" To his descendants, however, the name only remained while the substance disappeared. In the very next generation his ephemeral principality was dissolved; the ordinary law of partition was reverted to, and his son Kali\u00e1n S\u00e1h received the separate estate of Garabpur. The remainder of his domains passed to a second son, Jagd\u00ed R\u00e9\u00e9, in the third generation from whom they were split up into three estates, Part\u00e1bpur, R\u00e1mpur, and Sar\u00e9e Kali\u00e1n.\n\nGarabpur, Part\u00e1bpur, and R\u00e1mpur are now of sufficient importance to have separate sanads, but the story of their growth is made up of wearisome details. The two latter are principally remarkable for the peculiarity of their tenures; in the first place, though distinct in interest from each other, they contain many villages common to both, in which sometimes\n\n* Dr. Butler's Southern Oudh, p. 119.\n\u2020 The samindars of Ch\u00e1nda were still called Bachgotis when the Ak\u00e1-i-Akbar\u00ed was composed.\nthere is a third and even a fourth sharer; in the second place, each of the properties thus curiously constituted is, though a taluqa, in possession of a coparcenary community.\n\nThe Bachgotis of Tappa Asl.\u2014Regarding this portion of the Bachgoti fraternity there is little to be said, except that it still monopolizes nearly the whole of the pargana Tappa Asl, which it considers to be its birthright by inheritance from Asal R\u00e1e, who won it with the sword from the earlier Bais and Bhadayy\u00e1n occupants.* Either of their own free-will, or because there have been no elder sons capable, by force or otherwise, of convincing their younger brethren of the advantage of a custom of primogeniture, they have all alike remained in a common level of obscurity. Their traditions go back to a time in the distant past, when a single share in a partition was represented by six thousand bighas; but at the present time their villages are more minutely subdivided perhaps than any others in the district. Their principal estates, of which the rest are mostly offshoots, are Sissaindi, Kali\u00e1npur, Bhadewa, and Biss\u00e1pur. Under native rule the Bachgotis of Tappa Asl were not a bit behind the rest of their clan in turbulence and audacity, and the following story is told as an illustration of their character. On the arrival of a new Government official among them, they pointed out to him the tombs of various of his predecessors, disapproval of whose rule they had testified by armed resistance; and as an appropriate comment on this cheerful exhibition, requested him to carefully observe those monuments, and bear their import well in mind in the administration of his office.\n\nI may here add a list of the various shrines and temples of Sultanpur, thus affording some idea of the religious life of the people, whose history and warlike annals have been related.\n\n**Hindu religious places.**\n\n| Name of village | Name of temple | Remarks |\n|-----------------|---------------|---------|\n| Hassanpur       | Temple of Mah\u00e1b\u00edr | Built by R\u00e1mji\u00e1wan, K\u00e1yath, 75 years ago. |\n| Dakhwa Il\u00e1qa of Bhat-gawan | ... | Built by Durg\u00e1 P\u00e1nde at a cost of Rs. 200 in 1376 faisl (A.D. 1869). |\n| Katw\u00e1n          | Ditto         | Built by R\u00e1m Suchitt, Subadar, at a cost of Rs. 200 in 1970 faisl (A.D. 1862). |\n| Chh\u00e1oni Sadr    | Ditto         | Built by P\u00edr Bakhsh, Kalw\u00e1r, at a cost of Rs. 1,500 in 1242 faisl (A.D. 1884). |\n| Ditto           | Ditto         | Built by Shuddin, Subadar, at a cost of Rs. 150 in 1272 faisl (A.D. 1864). |\n| Ditto           | Ditto         | This temple stands on the banks of the Gumti near Sita Kund; was built by Bandhan, Ag-phottri, at a cost of Rs. 200, 30 years ago. |\n| Ditto           | Ditto         | Built by Jh\u00e1\u00fa L\u00e1l, Chandhri, at a cost of Rs. 300, 24 years ago. |\n| Ditto           | Ditto         | Built by Harday\u00e1l Thathera at a cost of Rs. 250, 25 years ago. |\n| Ditto           | Masonry Dharams\u00e1la | Four hundred years ago this was built from the subscription made by the Banians of asdr bazar and district officials.

Its history is so much interwoven with that of the district that I will give here only the most prominent points in it. The original town is said to have been founded by Kusa, son of Rama, and to have been named after him Kusapura or Kusabhawanpur. It subsequently fell into the hands of the Bhars who retained it until it was taken from them by the Musalmans in the twelfth century. About seven hundred years ago, it is said, two brothers, Sayyad Muhammad and Sayyad Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn, horse-dealers by profession, visited Eastern Oudh, and offered some horses for sale to the Bhar chieftains of Kushbhawanpur, who seized the horses and put the two brothers to death. This came to the ears of Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn Ghori, whose piety equal to his valour forbade him to allow such an outrage upon the descendants of the prophet to pass unpunished. Gathering a mighty host, therefore, he set out for Kushbhawanpur, and at length arrived and pitched his tents in Karaundi, then a dense jungle near the devoted town, on the opposite side of the river. Here he remained encamped for a year without gaining any advantage over the besieged, when feigning to be weary of the fruitless contest, and anxious only to obtain an unmolested retreat, he had some hundreds of palanquins richly fitted up, and sent them as a peace-offering to the Bhars,\n\n* By Mr. A. F. Millet, C.S.\npretending that they were filled with presents peculiarly suited to the taste of those for whom they were intended.*\n\nThe cupidity of the Bhars overcame their caution, and they received the fatal gift within their walls. But suddenly, at a given signal, the palanquins were all thrown open by unseen hands and out sprung a crowd of armed warriors, the very flower of Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn's army, who, thus taking their enemies unprepared, speedily put them to the sword. Kusbh\u00e1wanpur was reduced to ashes, and a new town of Sultanpur, so called from the rank of the victor, rose upon its ruins.\n\nSultanpur is often mentioned by Muhammadan historians, but only as the means of identifying the scene of a great battle which took place in its immediate neighbourhood, nor can it, so far as I am aware, boast of having been the birthplace of any man of note. It was nevertheless at one time a flourishing little town consisting of several muhallas or wards.\n\nBut many years before annexation a military station and cantonments were established on the right bank of the river in a village then known as Girghit,\u2020 but now more commonly called by officials Sultanpur, or chh\u00e1oni sark\u00e1r, and by the rustic population kamp\u00fa or the camp. From this period the importance of the old town began to decline, and its condition in the year 1839 is thus described:\u2014\"The only supposed remains of the Bhar city now extant are two brick wells at the south verge of the present town, and about a mile from the river, which still contain water and a rising ground (dih) called Majharg\u00e1on in the middle of the town, consisting of broken bricks, the remnants of the palace of the Bhar sovereigns. On the summit of the dih is a partially ruined fort built by the Sultan, and containing houses which are now occupied by the faujdar and his followers; there is also a mosque built by the Sultan, within the town and north-west of the fort. There are two or three smaller mosques built by Sayyads, who are chaudhris of the pargana, and have salaries varying from Rs. 100 to Rs. 500 a month, besides rent-free lands, for keeping the revenue accounts of the pargana. The town having no manufacture or trade is in a decayed state, and contains only 1,500 inhabitants, chiefly sip\u00e1his and personal followers of the chaudhris with a few cultivators, and of this population 100 are Musalmans. It contains many old brick dwelling-houses and a few new ones, among others a large one now building by one of the chaudhris Muhammad Ali, who was also the vakil envoy of the Lucknow darb\u00e1r 'near' the commandant of the Company's adjoining cantonment.\" The whole town was finally razed to the ground during the military operations connected with the reoccupation of the province, in consequence of the inhabitants having been concerned in the murder of two British officers at the outbreak of the mutiny.\n\nUntil 1837, the Sultanpur military force consisted of a regiment of native infantry and a detachment of artillery, but in that year the latter\n\n* This appears to have been very favourite, and if all accounts be believed, a very often successful stratagem. For other instances of it see Hiphinstone's History of India, 336, note, and Murray's History of India, 189.\n\u2020 The name of Girghit is still preserved in Girghit Gh\u00e1k.\nwas withdrawn, and thereafter until annexation there were no guns or cavalry of any kind. At annexation the force was considerably increased, its conduct in the mutiny is described elsewhere. On reoccupation a detachment of a British regiment was stationed here for a short time; and the recollection of the fact is now perpetuated by its lines, which lay about a mile or two south of those of the native infantry, having given a name to a tract now demarcated as a separate village, Gora B\u0101rik, or the barracks for the European soldiers. In 1861 all the troops, British and Native, were removed, and Sultanpur ceased to be a military cantonment.\n\nThe present civil station occupies the site of the old cantonments. It lies \"on the right bank of the Gumti river upon a dry soil, among deep ravines which drain off the water rapidly. The bungalows are on the verge looking down into the river and upon the level patches of land dividing the ravines. The water in the wells is some fifty feet below the surface on a level with the stream below.\" This was written in the year 1849; there were then \"no groves within a mile of the cantonments; and no lakes, marshes, or jungles within a great many, and the single trees in and near the cantonments were few.\" At the present time, owing mainly to the great interest taken by Colonel Perkins, while Deputy Commissioner, in the improvement of the station, the unsightliness of the bleak ravines is hidden by the graceful foliage of the acacia; and the roads, of which there is a plentiful supply, are lined on either side with rows of mango and other shady trees, while the public gardens more than ten acres in extent exact a just tribute of praise from all who visit them. A fine kachahri has recently been erected, and immediately opposite to it is a church of modest dimensions, but no mean architectural beauty. Of the other public buildings the principal are the jail erected on the site of and partly composed of the European infantry barracks, the Government schools, the charitable dispensary, and the police station.

Its area is 96 square miles or 81,645 acres divided into 107 villages. The cultivated area is 37,052 acres, and the uncultivated 24,593. The irrigated portion is only 12,674 acres and the unirrigated 24,378. The soil is mostly loam. The river Kaly\u00e1ni, flowing from east to west, forms the northern boundary for eleven miles; it is much utilized for irrigation purposes; nineteen villages lie on its banks. The Gumti which forms the southern boundary is to some extent mischievous during the rains. Its course of about 10 miles is very tortuous, there are 12 villages lying on its banks. The average amount of rainfall for the years 1874-75 was 40\u00bd inches. Wells are on the average 12 feet deep. Unmetalled roads lead from S\u00farajpur to Dhoti Gh\u00e1t (4 miles), and to P\u00fara Gh\u00e1t in Tahsil Haidargarh. The following are the bazars in this pargana, Mau, Mahip\u00e1lganj, Debiganj, Dhoti, Sa\u00e1datganj, Khasori, Tikra, and Ahmadpur. There are five schools, a police station at the headquarters of the Tahsil of R\u00e1m Sanehi Ghat, and a police post at Kotwa on the metalled road. The registry and post-offices are at Mahip\u00e1lganj. The Government revenue\namounts to Rs. 96,488. The 107 villages of the pargana are thus held:\n\n| Taluqdari | ... | ... | ... | 57 |\n|-----------|-----|-----|-----|----|\n| Zamindari | ... | ... | ... | 43 |\n| Pattidari | ... | ... | ... | 7  |\n\nTotal | ... | ... | ... | 107\n\nThe population amounts to 65,953 living in 13,482 houses.\n\nThe pargana takes its name from the chief town which has been in existence for the last 600 years. This part of the country was called S\u00farajpur Bahrela and was originally in possession of Bhars, who were succeeded by Path\u00e1ns, the chief of whom, \u00c1war Khan, rebelled in the time of Akbar. A force was sent in 964 A.H. (1547 A.D.), of which R\u00e1ja Baram Bali was ris\u00e1ld\u00e1r, who expelled the rebellious Path\u00e1n and took possession of the estate. This officer was the ancestor of the present taluqdar. In later Oudh history R\u00e1ja Singhji, one of the family, was a very formidable chief, whose career is sketched by Colonel Sleeman in pp. 256 and 257 of his \"Tour in Oudh.\" The taluqdars of the pargana are B\u00e1bu Mah\u00edp\u00e1l Singh of S\u00farajpur and R\u00e1\u00e9 Abhir\u00e1m Bali of R\u00e1mpur.\n\nS\u00daRAJPUR\u2014Pargana SURAJPUR\u2014Tahsil R\u00c1M SANEHI GHAT\u2014District BARA BANKL.\u2014This village gives its name to the pargana. It was founded 600 years ago. The taluqa was called S\u00farajpur Bahrela after the Bhars in whose possession it originally was. The next occupants were the Path\u00e1ns whose chief, \u00c1war Khan, refused to pay the Government revenue, revolted, and was overthrown by R\u00e1ja Baram Bali Singh, the ancestor of the present taluqdar. This r\u00e1ja was granted 71 villages; he fixed his residence at Bahrela, and afterwards at Dhoti on the bank of the Gumti. The Government revenue of the taluqa is Rs. 52,630.\n\nSURHARPUR Pargana\u2014Tahsil AKBARPUR\u2014District FYZABAD.\u2014This pargana is situated at the south-east corner of the district lying along both sides of the river Tons. It contains 94,519 acres, of which 48,400 are cultivated and 22,600 are barren, there being a very great quantity of \u00fas\u00e1r land in it; it contains 233 demarcated villages, but these include in all 549 small towns and hamlets. It is intersected by three unnavigable rivers\u2014the Tons, the Majhoi, and the Bangar, which abundantly lend their water for irrigation purposes.\n\nIts population is 82,927 being at the rate of 560 to the square mile, the Government revenue has been fixed at Rs. 98,175, being at the rate of Re. 1-10-2 per culturable acre; in Akbar's time it was Rs. 42,000. More than half the area is irrigated, and water is generally abundant. That portion of the pargana lying south of the Gumti has recently been placed in the Sultanpur district, Tahsil K\u00e1d\u00edpur, as will appear from the account of that district.\n\nThe history of the pargana is thus epitomized by Mr. Carnegy, Commissioner.\n\nThe origin of the name of this pargana is unknown, but it is said to have been given to it by one Sohandal, a chief of the Bhars.\nIt is further affirmed, that prior to the adoption of the designation of pargana the tract of country subsequently included within its bounds, consisting of 748 villages was divided into the tappas marginally noted. Surharpur is named in the Afn-i-Akbari as one of the forty parganas included in sark\u00e1r Jaunpur, subah Allahabad.\n\nThe Bhars were formerly dominant in this pargana, and it was inhabited chiefly by them; traces of their buildings may still be seen in the seven following villages:\u2014Surharpur, Harpur, Kh\u00e1npur-Pilai, Umran, Bhojgi, Deodi, and Masora. Their advent and status is matter for conjecture, but they are known to have paid revenue to the rulers of Delhi, and their downfall is here attributed to default, and lack of power to manage, in the early days of Taim\u00far Shah, 450 years ago.* The Th\u00e1rus of the Tar\u00e1i are said by the people of these parts to be the descendants of the expelled Bhars, but in 14 villages of this pargana an unusually large number of these people are still to be found tending swine, seldom tilling on their own account, and engaged in menial servitude. None of the existing Bhars have any rights in the soil, and so all proprietary rights date from a period subsequent to them, and may be traced back to seven parties who, from time to time, settled in the pargana, first as servants of the Bhars, and who eventually succeeded these people in their revenue engagements with the dominant power.\n\nIn 1801, Nawab Sa\u00e1dat \u00c1li made over what are known to us as the \"ceded districts\" of the old regulations, the transfer being effected in accordance with the actual status of 1206 fa\u0161lf (A.D. 1798), and under this arrangement the boundary with the Azamgarh district, of both pargana Surharpur and Birhar was formed.\n\nUnder this transfer 199 villages, comprising the entire tappa of P\u00edkarpur and portions of seven other tappas, passed away from pargana Surharpur, and these, with pargana Negun in Azamgarh, and part of Ungli in Jaunpur, on the authority of Sir H. M. Elliott, were formed into what is now known as pargana M\u00e1hul, of the former district. At the time of cession, M\u00e1hul was entered in the registers as a taluqa only, still it was one of the four portions into which the province of Gorakhpur was\n\n---\n\n* Note.\u2014It will at once occur to the historical student that Taim\u00far Shah never penetrated further than Delhi, where he remained only a few days after he overthrew Mahm\u00fad Tughlaq in 1398 A.D., when he again quitted India. Almost simultaneously, however, with the above events, Mahm\u00fad's Was\u00edr, Khw\u00e1ja Jah\u00e1n, founded the kingdom of Jaunpur, A.D. 1394, or 470 years ago; and he no doubt had a good deal to do with the suppression of the Bhars in these parts. So that, though it appears quite absurd to say that Taim\u00far exercised any influence here 450 years ago, it is not difficult to see that his operations before Delhi were intimately connected with the establishment of the Jaunpur dynasty, which included all these parts and extended up to Kanauj. By local tradition, a great many events here are attributed to the time of Taim\u00far, and the above facts explain the reason, and show tradition to be not far out.\ndivided. In the middle of the last century two Sayyads of the name of Sher Jah\u00e1n and Shamsher Jah\u00e1n acquired large possessions in Negun, Ungli, and Surharpur, and taking up their abode in M\u00e1lul gave to their usurpations the name of \"taluqa M\u00e1hul.\"*\n\nThese Sayyads are said to have sprung from a renowned saint whose piety was so great that his wishes were always fulfilled. In Mr. Thomason's report of the settlement of the Azamgarh district, para. 32, mention is made of this family of Sayyads, who are there said to have obtained possession of pargana M\u00e1hul as a zamindari grant at so early a period that the tradition of it was lost. They located themselves firmly in the pargana, suppressing the Rajput communities in many of the villages. The head of the family had the title of r\u00e1ja, but he was dispossessed of his Government office by the Nawab of Oudh previous to session. He still however retained some villages as his private property when Mr. Thomason wrote (1837).\u2020 The writer saw the last of these r\u00e1jas, Ir\u00e1dat Jah\u00e1n, hanged, under the operation of martial law, in September, 1857, for rebellion, he having proclaimed himself N\u00e1zim of Jaunpur. His eldest son was subsequently sentenced to imprisonment by the ordinary courts. His daughter is married to Malik Hid\u00e1yat Husen, one of the principal taluqdars of the Fyzabad district. Thus was taluqa M\u00e1hul created, and so it passed away.\n\nThe 199 villages that I have alluded to as having been transferred from Surharpur formed part of the great taluqa of which I have been writing, and when the separation took place all villages belonging to that estate went over with it, without any reference whatever to geographical situation or a convenient frontier. It was this that led to the troublesome state of things which has ever since existed, of isolated villages of Oudh being found within the circuit of our old districts, and vice vers\u00e9.\n\nThe portion of pargana Surharpur which remained in Oudh after cession, and which passed into our hands at annexation, is in shape something like an irregular arch, and consisted of 549 villages.\n\nThe Palw\u00e1rs.\u2014This is the more prosperous clan. One Pirthir\u00e1j Deo, Sombansi, known also by the name of M\u00far Deo, and more familiarly still as Bh\u00far Deo, is said to have come from Pali, in the Hardoi district in Oudh, in Sambat 1305 (A.D. 1248), or six hundred and fifteen years ago, and to have taken up his residence in the village at Rann\u00fapur close to Bandipur in this pargana, where he accepted service under the Bhars. From having come from Pali, he and his descendants thenceforth took the name of Palw\u00e1rs, and ceased to be known as Sombansis. After a time he was promoted to the management of tappas Tardi and Kharka. Subsequently, when the Bhars were driven out, he entered into revenue engagements with the Delhi rulers for the tappas in question, consisting of 96 villages, and he afterwards extended his influence by taking possession of parganas Kauria, Tilheni, Atraula, and Dadur Qari\u00e1t, which are now in the Azamgarh district. Mr. Thomason also shows that these powerful people made still\n\n* Sir H. M. Elliott.\n\u2020 Asamgarh Settlement Report.\nfurther appropriations at a subsequent period, by encroaching on the neighbouring forest lands of Nizamabad.\n\nPirhiraj Deo had five sons; of these Bhim Deo, the eldest, and Bharat Deo, the second, were legitimate, and accompanied their father from Pali. He then formed a connexion with a female inhabitant of the Rannipur woods, of great personal beauty, to whom tradition assigns the character of being the daughter of a fairy (Deokannya) or of a demon (dain). This woman gave birth to Harihar Deo, the third son of Pirhiraj. The latter is said to have formed other attachments for an Ahirin and a Bharin, both of low origin, and of whom there are multitudinous descendants in the Azamgarh district; but as the history of these branches pertains more properly to that district, I will not encumber this report with further details regarding them.\n\nOf the above named sons the eldest, Bhim Deo, betook himself to a hermit's life, and he therefore forfeited his birthright. To the second son, Bharat Deo, was assigned pargana Kauria Tilheni, district Azamgarh, and at a subsequent period his offspring overran the pargana of Birhar in this district: and it is from him that the four present taluqdars of Birhar descend, representing the senior and legitimate branch of the clan.\n\nTo Harihar Deo, the illegitimate son, was assigned the tappas of Tardi and Kharka in pargana Surharpur, and he and his offspring have always on account of their origin been stigmatized as Dainias (the children of the dain) or Bantarias (the dwellers in woods).\n\nTradition says that on one occasion, soon after the birth of her son, this lady of the woods was engaged in the homely office of baking cakes, when her infant, which lay some paces off, began to cry. The domestic feelings were divided between neglecting the babe or neglecting the cake; at this juncture the husband arrived, just in time to see his (fairy or fiend) wife assume supernatural and gigantic proportions, so as to allow both the baking and nursing to go on at one and the same time. But finding her secret discovered the dain disappeared for ever, leaving her son as a legacy to her astonished husband! This child was the Harihar Deo mentioned above, from whom this branch of the clan descend. They still form the majority of the inhabitants of fourteen villages in this pargana, while the taluqdars of Tigra, Babu Pirhti Pal Singh, and of Morera, Thakurain Brij Kunwar, widow of Ram Datt Singh, belong to this branch, live in this pargana, and are seventeen removes from their common progenitor, the son of the dain. Strange though it may seem, the villages in which these taluqdars live, and which give their names to their respective properties, are only in part owned by them, and in part by others.\n\nOur earliest records have reference to the year A.D. 1790 (1197 fasil) and from these we learn that at that time the family held in this pargana two taluqas and twenty-five smaller estates, paying Rs. 36,266 annual revenue to Government. At the last summary settlement two taluqas remained paying Rs. 9,369, and 13 smaller estates paying Rs. 10,706 per annum; the clansmen are also sub-proprietors in 46 villages, which pay Rs. 8,489 a year; their total payments in this subdivision thus equal\nRs. 28,564. The falling off in their payments is in consequence of the estate of Kehera Salempur only being for a time in one of the taluqas, about the year above indicated.\n\nThese Palwars were the first people who offered a successful opposition to the extensions and usurpations of the Rajkumar clan. In the pargana article of Aldemau reference is made to the battles fought for the village of Masora in this pargana. That village belonged to the Palwar property of Birma. This property was managed by six branches of one family of the clan. Of these four having fallen into decay made their holdings over to the taluqdar of Dera; a fifth had already made his share over to the taluqdar of Meopur; and when the latter went to take possession, the Dera party raised the country, and the great battle was fought in which so many of the Meopur family lost their lives; and they also lost, and never afterwards recovered, the footing they had in mubal Birma.\n\nIt was this branch of the Rajkumars from their local position that was most likely to overrun the Palwar country, but their usurpations in that quarter were terminated by the proceedings at Masora.\n\nThe House of Tigra.\u2014From 1790 to 1816 A.D., Babu Sarabjit Singh held this taluqa, which then consisted of 46 villages, paying Rs. 9,501 revenue. He left two sons, Gobin Bakhsh Singh and Gobind Dayal Singh, and was succeeded by the former, but the property in the meanwhile had lost some of its villages. About the year 1828, these brothers gratuitously put to death Mohan Lal, qanungo of the pargana, who happened to have a house in the Azamgarh district; and on this account the relatives of the deceased were enabled to apply to the British authorities for redress.\n\nThe brothers were summoned to stand their trial; but they failing to give themselves up were outlawed, and several ineffectual attempts were made to apprehend them. About the year 1832, the name of the younger brother was entered as joint owner of the property. In 1839 the Oudh officials succeeded in apprehending Gobind Bakhsh, the elder brother, and made him over to the Azamgarh authorities, who, owing to want of jurisdiction, had to transfer him to the Lucknow authorities, by whom he was retained a close prisoner until long afterwards, when he was released by death. The younger brother, Gobind Dayal, evaded capture for many years, but in the year 1852, being then a revenue defaulter and fugitive of the Oudh Government, he fell sick, and in the hope doubtless of obtaining absolution for his many sins, he betook himself to Allahabad, hoping that there he might die. He was traced however by Captain Orr of the Oudh frontier police and apprehended, and he died shortly afterwards in the Azamgarh jail ere his case was investigated. He was succeeded in his property by his son Babu Pirthi Pal Singh, the present taluqdar, who was at once officially recognized by the Oudh authorities. The two brothers, whose history is above sketched, were notorious freebooters, and within the recollection of the writer their names inspired terror all along the Azamgarh border.* Their successor is a man of comparative insignificance,\n\n* Note.\u2014When Wajid Ali Khan was Nazim his amil, Jamshed Khan, was killed in an encounter with this clan; and the present Thakurian Brij Kunwar of Morera succeeded her father-in-law, who fell fighting against the Nazim, Raja Darshan Singh.\nyet he made himself troublesome in the mutinies, and a force was sent from Azamgarh to destroy his fort at Tigra, which is just within the Fyzabad district.\n\nThe R\u00e1jkum\u00e1rs\u2014The history of the rise and progress of this clan in the district is detailed in the Aldemau pargana article. Having overrun that pargana some 200 or more years ago, they gradually spread in the Surharpur direction, and at the date of our earliest records, which go back over 90 years, we find them holding the settlement of six villages in this subdivision, and they had in the meantime so well improved their opportunities, that when we annexed the province, they had absorbed 188 villages.\n\nThe Taluqdar of Barag\u00e1on, B\u00e1b\u00fa Umresh Singh, belongs to this clan, and has his headquarters in the village of this pargana which gives its name to his property, and which he usurped from the descendants of Sayyad Kam\u00e1l.\n\nUnder our revised settlement operations pargana Surharpur as finally arranged, contains 233 villages, which are now held as follows, Nos. 1 to 6 being Palw\u00e1rs, 7 to 9 R\u00e1jkum\u00e1rs, and 10 and 11 Muhammadans:\n\n| No. | Name of taluqdar and of estate. | No. of villages. | Remarks. |\n|-----|---------------------------------|------------------|----------|\n| 1   | B\u00e1b\u00fa Pirthl P\u00e1l of Tigra        | 18\u00bd              | These branches divided 14 generations ago; the estates are nine generations old as taluqas. |\n| 2   | Brij Kunwar of Morera           | 7\u00bd               | These villages have been included in the Birhar taluqas since 1824 faisl. |\n| 3   | B\u00e1b\u00fa Haridatt Singh of Birhar   | 2                 | All acquired since 1180 faisl. |\n| 4   | Kishan Paras\u00e1d Singh of Birhar  | 2                 | Acquired in 1912 faisl. |\n| 5   | Mahip Nar\u00e1in Singh of Birhar    | 1\u00bd                | Acquired since 1916 faisl. |\n| 6   | Shiu Parg\u00e1sh Singh of Birhar    | 1\u00bd                | Held by independent zamindars. |\n| 7   | Udresh Singh of Dhaurus         | 49\u00bd               | |\n| 8   | Umreah Singh of Barag\u00e1on        | 38                | |\n| 9   | R\u00e1ja Shankar Baksh of Dehra     | 24                | |\n| 10  | Malik Hid\u00e1yat Husen of S\u00e1manpur.| 9                 | |\n| 11  | Mir B\u00e1gar Husen of P\u00edrpur       | 19\u00bd               | |\n| 12  | Non-Taluqa villages             | 60\u00bd               | |\n\nThe pargana contains three towns, of which the capital bears the same name, and numbers 1,474 inhabitants. It is now a place of small import, but formerly, when it was in the hands of the Sayyad zamindars, it used to supply men of education as Government officials. It stands on the left bank of the river Majhoi, which is here spanned in the Jaunpur direction by a curious old masonry bridge said to be of Akbar's time. There are also ruins of interest in this town. There is an old masonry fort on a rising ground, of the Bhar time, and tradition says that a Jogi named Subh N\u00e1th once held it, and so great was his repute that people fell to worshipping him. For this he incurred the displeasure of Sayyad S\u00e1l\u00e1r Mas\u00e1ud who therefore proceeded against him and put him to death. This the Bhars resented, but they were overthrown and their fort destroyed. This old fort is also said to have been the stronghold of the Bhar Chief.\nSohandal, mentioned in the beginning of this pargana history, but little reliance however can be placed on the stories told of either him or Subh N\u00e1th. The other towns are Jal\u00e1lpur and Nakpur.\n\nUnder the king's Government this pargana contained a colony of 600 houses of Muhammadan weavers. The facilities for getting Europe piece-goods, a result of annexation, and the demand for cotton consequent on the American War, has diminished the number of these weavers just one-half, there are now 300 houses of them in the pargana, and of these 253 are situated in the towns of Jal\u00e1lpur and Nakpur. Situated between these towns is the village of Dundwa. At this place an edifice of some pretension, known by the name of the \"Im\u00e1mb\u00e1ra Panch\u00e1ti Jul\u00e1ha,\" or \"Subscription Church of the Weavers,\" was built, nearly a century ago, under the supervision of Y\u00e1r Muhammad, weaver and broker. Rs. 4,000 were raised for the purpose by the fraternity, each man setting aside the fourth of a pice from the price of every piece of cloth he wove towards the common object. An annual fair is here held on the 13th day of Rajjab, (July August) which is largely attended by persons in search of relief from their sorrows.\n\nUeraha.\u2014Is the only other place in the pargana which contains any approach to a bazar; it is situated on the Jaunpur frontier, and the population amounts to 340 souls.\n\nY\u00e1singarh fort.\u2014This picturesque masonry ruin was built by one Shekh Ghul\u00e9m Y\u00e1s\u00edn, whose ancestors, Shekh Arz\u00e1ni and Shekh N\u00edz\u00e1m-ud-d\u00edn, are said to have come from Ghazni, and to have located themselves in this place, which was then a jungle, and is in fact little else now.\n\nThis person rose to be N\u00e1ib Subahdar of Jaunpur and Gh\u00e1zipur and acquired great power and influence, which he exercised by taking proprietary possession of the surrounding country. But his immediate offspring turned out utterly worthless and soon squandered his acquisition; his descendants now subsist on a few bighas of rent-free land which they hold from the Taluqdar Malik Hid\u00e1yat Husen. It is popularly believed that forty goblets of gold mohars still lie buried in this ruined fort.\n\nDeodi.\u2014This village is mentioned at the beginning of this pargana history as one of those in which traces may yet be seen of the Bhar race. This is a Fyzabad village, but it falls within the circuit of the district of Azamgarh. I mention it here because two copper inscriptions have lately been surrendered to the authorities, essaying to indicate the presence of much buried treasure; but as these profess to be 1,200 years old, while they mention existing places by their Muhammadan and not by their original Hindu names, it seems improbable that they can be of any value. It is obvious that Sultanpur, Suj\u00e1nganj, and such like names are due to the Muhammadan conquest alone, which bears date some generations later.\n\nS\u00daSUMAU\u2014Pargana SAFIPUR\u2014Tahsil SAFIPUR\u2014District UNAO\u2014This village lies six miles south-west from the tahsil station, and 20 miles west from the sadr staton Unao.\nThe Kaly\u00e1ni river flows close to the village on the south-west. Kan-\nchan Singh of the Janw\u00e1r tribe is said to have reclaimed this place in the\nEmperor Akbar's time, but in what year is not known. The derivation of\nthe name cannot be made out. In former times this was the residence of\nSayyad Mubarak Ali, and the village bore the name of Mubarakpur. It\nafterwards fell into decay, and on the expulsion of the Sayyads by Karan\nDeo it was again restored by Kanchan Singh. It is on a level tract of\nground; its appearance is very pretty, climate healthy, water sweet; soil\nloam, no jungle. There was a great battle fought here between Karan\nDeo and the Sayyads; there is a market held here attended by about 700\npersons. Corn, English cloth, bullocks, and vegetables are sold. Shoes,\nearthenware, and some jewellery are made here.

It has no water communication whatever, though there are\nnumerous jhils or tals in the immediate neighbourhood from which the\ntown takes its name.

The population was at the\nCensus of 1869 2,098, principally cultivators, the Musalmans being in\nexcess of the Hindus.\n\nThe place has three mosques, and in the month of Bh\u00e1don (August)\nthere is held a Musalm\u00e1n Fair in memory of a local saint, at which ten or\ntwelve thousand people attend; and many commodities are sold, especially\nbrass and copper ware.

The annual value of the bazar sales averages\nRs. 25,000. Half the town is held by the Kh\u00e1nz\u00e1s\u00e1s (Shekhs) and half\nby Kirm\u00e1n\u00ed Sayyads. The latter assert that it was their ancestor who\n\n* By Mr. M. I. Ferrar, C.S., Assistant Commissioner.\nfounded it 900 years ago; and that the Shekhs have come in through marriage.\n\n**TAMBAUR Pargana**\u2014**Tahsil Biswan**\u2014**District Sitapur**.\u2014Pargana Tambaur is bounded on the north by district Kheri, and on the three sides by the Kundri, Biswan, and Lahrapur parganas. It contains 190 square miles, of which 132 are under cultivation.\n\nThe area is thus classified:\n\n| Cultivated acres | ... | ... | ... | 84,805 |\n|------------------|-----|-----|-----|--------|\n| Culturable ditto | ... | ... | ... | 21,146 |\n| Rent-free ditto  | ... | ... | ... | 36     |\n| Barren ditto     | ... | ... | ... | 15,985 |\n\nTotal acres ... 121,471\n\nThe population was at the census of 1869 as follows:\n\n| Hindus, agricultural | ... | ... | ... | 46,605 |\n| Ditto, non-agricultural | ... | ... | ... | 16,816 |\n| Musalmans, agricultural | ... | ... | ... | 2,880 |\n| Ditto, non-agricultural | ... | ... | ... | 2,988 |\n\nTotal ... 69,289\n\nThese live in 13,237 houses, each of which thus accommodates 5\u00b72 individuals. There are 365 souls to the square mile. To each head of the agricultural population are 1\u00b77 acres of cultivated against 2\u00b71 of assessed land. The Musalmans are only 8\u00bd per cent. of the entire population.\n\nThe physical features of this pargana differ very much from those of the rest of the district, with the exception of Kundri, which resembles it to a great extent. Bounded on the north by the large river Dahawar and on the west by the Gogra, it is intersected by another large river, the Chauka, and by numerous smaller rivers such as the Ul and the Dhauria, which render the pargana a complete net-work of streams.\n\nThe soil is everywhere tarai and ganjar, that is to say, it is so moist as not to require irrigation for the ordinary rabi crops, and during the rainy season scarcely a village but is more or less flooded. When the floods are heavy, the autumn crops perish. On the waters subsiding often a rich deposit of loam is left, often a layer of sand, which is ruinous to vegetation. The Chauka, too, is most eccentric in its course, and both it and the Dahawar annually cut away land from the villages by or through which they flow. And yet notwithstanding all the disadvantages, the pargana on the whole is a good one, for the industrious classes are numerous. In other words, the zamindars are in receipt of a rental paid on a higher scale than if there were no Kurmis or Mur\u0101os among the peasantry. The pargana has no lakes, forests, or large villages.\n\n* By Mr. M. L. Ferrar, C.S., Assistant Commissioner.\nThere are 186 villages in the Tambaur pargana held as follows:\n\n| No. | Owner |\n|-----|-------|\n| 43  | Bhaksh Shin Bakhsh (Gaur), vide pargana L\u00e1harpur. |\n| 10  | Raja Muneshwar Bakhsh of Mall\u00e1pur (Raikw\u00e1r). |\n| 1   | J\u00e1ngre. |\n| 1   | Janw\u00e1r. |\n| 3   | Mahant Harcharn D\u00e1s. |\n| 9   | Raja of Mahmudabad. |\n| 1   | Nawab Amjad Ali Khan. |\n| 7   | Bhaksh Fazl Ali (converted Gaur). |\n| 5   | Other Muhammadians. |\n\nThe zamindari villages are these\u201440 with Gaurs, 12 Raghubansis, 4 K\u00e1yaths, 6 Musalmans, 13 loyal grantees.\n\nThus we see that one half of the pargana is owned by the Gaurs. The taluqdars who own 80 villages out of the 186 are described elsewhere. Of the smaller zamindars the Raghubansi estate is known as Sikri Sipauli, and, with the exception of Bani\u00e1nmau in Kundri, is the only Raghubansi taluqa in the district of Sitapur. The ancestors of the Kurmis once owned many villages. They are now only 11, including Tambaur, the metropolis of the pargana.\n\nThe country was originally occupied by Raghubansis, Kurmis, K\u00e1yaths, Janw\u00e1rs, and P\u00e1s\u00eds. The last mentioned were dispossessed in king Akbar's time. Here again as in Khairabad and L\u00e1harpur we meet with the story of the extinct P\u00e1si zamindari.\n\nThe history of the pargana, as given by the local \"oldest inhabitants\" is as follows:\u2014In the days of Jai Chand, king of Kanauj, a Chandel chieftain, \u00c1lha by name, was granted the lands which were afterwards formed into the pargana. The modern town of Tambaur existed then as \"Purwa Tamboli\u00e1n,\" and this \u00c1lha gave it to one of his lieutenants, Ranua P\u00e1si, who built a fort in it. Soon after both master and man were slain in battle fighting under the banners of Jai Chand against Pirhti R\u00e9j, king of Delhi. But the P\u00e1si's descendants remained in possession for some time, in fact for 330 years, until dispossessed by king Akbar. When \u00c1lha first got the country he built him a fort in \u00danch\u00e1g\u00f3n across the Dah\u00e1war river, but this fell into decay on the founder's death. Soon afterwards, or in 589 A.H., just 700 years ago, Shah\u00e1b-ud-d\u00edn, the Ghori king, conquered Oudh, and among other things restored \u00c1lha's fort, calling it \"N\u00e1wa Garh, or new fort.\" It subsequently came to be known as new fort (Qila N\u00e1w\u00e1), and is so called in the \u00c1\u00edn-i-Akbari. This by a metathesis not uncommon in India was changed to \"Garh Qila N\u00e1w\u00e1,\" and by this name the pargana was known under native rule. Subsequent to Shah\u00e1b-ud-d\u00edn's time, or in 911 A.H. (A.D. 1494), the town and fort went into the river, and from that year up to 962 A.H. (A.D. 1545), the \u00e1mil of the period resided in Mughalpur. In the following year (963 A.H.), the headquarters of that official were transferred under Todar Mal's arrangement to Tambaur.\n\nThere are no places of historical or antiquarian interest in the pargana. The place is not mentioned in any of the poems or myths of Hind. The\nonly fairs celebrated in it are three small ones in Parbatpur, \u00danchag\u00e1on, and Sipauli, at which not more than 500 or 600 people assemble, and which require no further notice in this place. In Tambaur is a Shiwi\u00e1la built 100 years ago by Mansa R\u00e1m, Q\u00e1n\u00fango, who also constructed a masonry tank now fallen into decay.\n\nHere too is one of those martyr's tombs which we find scattered all over the northern districts of Oudh, and which are said to cover the remains of certain of the faithful, who accompanied the Sayyad S\u00e1l\u00e1r to this part of India in 1026 A.D. The martyr buried at Tambaur was Burh\u00e1n-ud-d\u00edn.\n\nThe only manufacture carried on in the pargana is that of saltpetre. The growth and manufacture of sugar is said to have been placed under a ban many centuries ago. Certain it is that all through what was once known as the Gur-ka il\u00e1qa no sugar is grown. Notice of this occurs under the town histories of Seota and L\u00e1harpur. In the same il\u00e1qa, too, the use of baked bricks or tiles in the construction of dwelling-houses is considered accursed.\n\nThe chief trade of the pargana is concentrated in Tambaur, only one road crosses the pargana, that from Sitapur running to the Mall\u00e1pur. Water communication is abundant.\n\n**TAMBAUR\u2014Pargana** TAMBAUR\u2014Tahsil BISW\u00c1N\u2014District SITAPUR.\u2014Tambaur 35 miles north-east of Sitapur, and six miles west of Mall\u00e1pur, on the high road which connects these two places. No other road runs through it. Two miles to the east is the river Dah\u00e1war, and four miles to the west is the Chauka, both of them navigable rivers throughout the year, and the intervening space is interlaced with many smaller streams which render cross country traffic in the rains a matter of very great difficulty. The town was founded 700 years ago by certain Tambolis, whence its name. About 300 years ago it became the seat of an \u00e1mil or revenue superintendent.\n\nThe population numbers 3,014 souls, who live in 520 mud-built houses. The only masonry house is that of the Q\u00e1zi. The town is situated in that part of the district which was once officially, and still is locally known as the Garh, \u201cor Garh Qila Naw\u00e1\u201d il\u00e1qa, so called from the new fort which in 589 A.H. Shah\u00e1b-ud-d\u00edn Ghori built on the site of the former fort of that Alha Chandel, who founded Seota (*quid vide*). All through this Garh Il\u00e1qa no burnt bricks or tiles are used in the construction of dwelling-houses, and the growing of sugarcane is also prohibited by an old superstition.\n\nTambaur includes in its limits the village of Ahmadabad. There are the remains of the old government fort where the revenue collector resided. At the school 62 boys are receiving the elements of instruction. A bazar is held twice a week, the annual value of the sales at which is estimated to be Rs. 5,000.\n\n*By Mr. M. L. Ferrar, C.S., Assistant Commissioner.*\nIt belongs to a Kurmi community. In the town is a Shiw\u00e1la and brick-built tank; the latter in decay; both constructed by Mansa R\u00e1m, q\u00e1n\u00fango. There are also several places of Muhammadan worship requiring no special notice, and there is a darg\u00e1h or tomb of one Burh\u00e1n-ud-d\u00edn, a martyr the faithful call him, who was in the army of Sayyad S\u00e1l\u00e1r when it passed through Tambeur in the early part of the 11th century.\n\n**T\u00c1NDA Pargana**\u2014**Tahsil T\u00c1NDA\u2014District FYZABAD.**\u2014This pargana is bounded on the north by the river Gogra, on the west by pargana Amsin, on the south by pargana Akbarpur, and on the east by pargana Birhar. It is washed for a distance of 15 miles on its north face by the waters of the river Gogra. It is well wooded, and is traversed by a beautiful avenue of fine old mango trees, which was planted some years ago by Musamm\u00e1t S\u00edtla, a native of T\u00e1nda, who married a Benares banker, and which formerly connected T\u00e1nda with Fyzabad\u2014a distance of nearly 40 miles. The history of the T\u00e1nda pargana is as follows:\n\nIt is affirmed that the Bhars formerly cleared this part of the district of jungle, and having established a village therein, they gave to it the name of Kh\u00e1sipur, because it was their personal abode. Traces of these people are still to be found in the villages of Mad\u00e1rpur, Th\u00e1n\u00fapur, Umeda, and Kh\u00e1sipur.\n\nWithin two miles of the latter village was a spot on the banks of the Gogra, which was formerly largely visited by Banj\u00e1ras or travelling dealers, probably because it was the only ferry for miles, and from the fact that the encamping ground of Banj\u00e1ras, and the gangs of Banj\u00e1ras themselves also, are both known by the name of T\u00e1nda, so this spot permanently came to be called by that name.\n\nIn process of time the place expanded into a town taking up the whole or a part of the lands of the villages marginally named.\n\n| 1. Jot Bakcha Q\u00e1zi. | 7. Fatt\u00e1 Patti. |\n|---------------------|----------------|\n| 2. \" Mir\u00e1n.         | 8. Mauz-ha.    |\n| 3. Siktaha.         | 9. Sakr\u00e1wal.   |\n| 4.

Alimuddinpur. |\n\nIn the course of his revenue territorial arrangements, the Emperor Akbar, it is said, gave to this pargana the joint names of Kh\u00e1sipur-T\u00e1nda, and it is so entered in his Doomsday book.\n\nIt formerly contained 408 villages, of which 70 were offshoots. Of these two have disappeared owing to the action of the river Gogra, three have been built over and included in the area of the town, being the first three marginally named above, another was taken up for his establishment by a Mr. John Scott, formerly employed in the cloth trade at T\u00e1nda, and 402 villages included in 37 muh\u00e1ls or estates remained in 1217 fa\u0161li or 1810 A.D. In the following year 38\u00bd villages were transferred to the Huz\u00far Tahsil establishment on being included in the P\u00edrpur taluqa. Again between\n\n* By Mr. P. Carnegy, Commissioner.\nthe years 1254 and 1262 fasli, or 1847 and 1855 A.D., the pargana was diminished by 141\u00bd villages, on these being transferred to the taluqas marginally named; so that 222 villages only remained at annexation. At the last summary settlement, however, the villages that had thus been transferred elsewhere were restored to the pargana, and under the arrangements then carried out they were reduced in number from 402 to 256 in number. Again under the more recent operations of the demarcation department this number was cut down to 149 villages and two jungle grants. Finally when pargana boundaries were adjusted by the settlement officer, 16 villages were transferred to Akbarpur, and 33 villages of pargana Iltifatganj being added on to Tanda, the pargana of Tanda as now constituted, containing 166 villages and two grants, was formed.\n\nIt has already been said that the river Gogra forms the northern boundary for a distance of 15 miles, and the Thirwa, a small unnavigable stream, winds its course through the pargana, falling into the former river just below its capital.\n\nThe earliest known distribution of landed property in the pargana vested in the following old families:\n\nI.\u2014The Malikhs of Khaspur.\u2014It is traditionally asserted that one Malik Kh\u00e1s Z\u00e1hidi of Bagdad came and settled in these parts some centuries ago, and taking up his residence at Khaspur, he gave to it his own name, and he soon attached several other villages thereto. This seems a more likely origin to the name than the one which attributes it to the Bhars.\n\nAt a subsequent period one Muzaffar Balakh\u00ed a mendicant, is said to have settled in the village, and owing to their having incurred his displeasure, he is said to have visited the descendants of the Z\u00e1hidi with his curse, in consequence of which they rapidly began to die off. In this emergency those who remained went to the faqir and craved his advice. He told them to get a couple of sun-dried earthen vessels, and to fill the one with sharbat and the other with water, to place them on the heads of two enceinte females, who were to carry them as far as possible without breaking, and that wherever the vessels broke there the children of the Malik were finally to settle. The vessel with the sharbat broke two miles to the east of Khaspur, and to the spot was given the name of Sakr\u00e1wal (from shakar, sugar); while the other vessel broke three miles further on, and to the spot was given the name of P\u00fanthar (from p\u00e1ni, water). The derivations seem far-fetched. In these two places the descendants of Malik Kh\u00e1s settled, and there their offspring are still to be found. One widow of the old stock, however, with her daughter, still remained in Khaspur. This girl was subsequently married to Sayyad H\u00e1mid of Ir\u00e1n, who came and settled there, and from him are descended Muhammad Husen and Tafazul Husen, the former of whom is still the proprietor of the village Muhammadpur; the latter was the owner of taluqa Khaspur of 53\u00bd villages which was confiscated by the British Government owing to his rebellion, he having been a prominent supporter of the rebel n\u00e1zim of Gorakhpur.\nII.\u2014The Sheikhs of Ras\u00falpur and \u00c1s\u00fapur, &c.\u2014Three hundred years ago one Shekh Khal\u00edl-ur-rahm\u00e1n, a native of T\u00far\u00e1n, came from Delhi, having been appointed q\u00e1zi of T\u00e1nda by that court, and took up his residence in what is now the town. He is said to have acquired an estate of 12 villages by driving out the Bhars, but he was surely late in the day to effect that. His successors divided the estate into two portions. The branch of q\u00e1zi Amjad soon disappeared, but the daughter of q\u00e1zi Fatt\u00fa married into the influential family of Sayyad Abdul B\u00e1qi who eventually succeeded him. A descendant of this daughter, Muhammad Hay\u00e1t, entered the Delhi service, and afterwards obtained a j\u00e1g\u00edr in these parts as a reward. In those days pargana T\u00e1nda was held as a j\u00e1g\u00edr by the royal washerman, and an exchange of j\u00e1g\u00edrs was afterwards effected between Muhammad Hay\u00e1t and the said washerman. The former having obtained a royal patent for the pargana as j\u00e1g\u00edr came and settled in the town, founding that portion of the bazar which is still known by his name.\n\nAfter the death of Muhammad Hay\u00e1t, Nawab Sa\u00e1dat Khan Burh\u00e1n-ul-mulk, assessed rupees 5,000 upon the estate which then descended to the heirs. Nawab Shuj\u00e1-ud-daula afterwards doubled this assessment, and his son, Nawab As\u00edf-ud-daula, took the estate into direct management in 1197 fasil or 1790 A.D., to the entire exclusion of Muhammad Hay\u00e1t\u2019s heirs.\n\nIn 1201 fasil or 1794 A.D., Mr. John Scott, the T\u00e1nda trader, already mentioned, farmed the entire pargana from the Lucknow authorities, and sub-leased it in two portions\u2014(1) Ras\u00falpur of 54 villages to Ghazanfar Ali, son of the aforesaid Muhammad Hay\u00e1t, and (2) \u00c1s\u00fapur of 26 manzas to Hasan Ali, nephew of the said Ghazanfar Ali. In 1203 fasil or 1796 A.D., Mr. Scott\u2019s connexion with the farm ceased, but the two men just named continued to hold their leases till 1227 fasil or 1820 A.D.\n\nIn the following year Ghazanfar Ali having previously nominated his daughter\u2019s son, Abb\u00e1s Ali, his successor, died. Abb\u00e1s Ali, commonly called r\u00e1ja, then got the qub\u00faliat of the Ras\u00falpur estate, which he held till it was confiscated on account of his persistent rebellion in 1857.\n\nHusen Ali having nominated his daughter\u2019s son, Ali Hasan, as his successor, died in 1227 fasil or 1820 A.D. Ali Hasan then held the \u00c1s\u00fapur estate till 1256 fasil or 1849 A.D., when by the favour of the then N\u00e1z\u00edm, it was incorporated into the Samanpur taluqa, and taken under direct management by the proprietor thereof. The taluqdar, however, as an act of grace, has lately conferred a sub-proprietary position on the representatives of Hasan Ali.\n\nMuhammad Hay\u00e1t, who has been mentioned above, did his best to have the town called after himself, but in this he entirely failed, and a street only is now known by his name. The town rapidly became largely populated by all classes, but more especially by Muhammadan hand-loom weavers (Jul\u00e1has), and by Hindu thread-spinners (katwah), who were alike famous for their skill and for the beauty and fineness of the fabrics they produced. Process of time a very large trade in cloth sprung up, so\nmuch so that Europeans became connected with it. Mr. Scott is said to have had an immense establishment, where all the cloth made in the bazar was brought to be washed and bleached. All the washermen seem to have been in his pay, and for the security which they enjoyed, a tax of 8 annas a score was readily paid by the weavers of the place to Mr. Scott for permission to use his establishment.\n\nIn the days when the pargana was held in j\u00e1g\u00edr tenure, the cesses and taxes pertaining to the town as per margin were all taken by the j\u00e1g\u00edrdar. Subsequently they were collected by the Government along with its land revenue. In 1207 fa\u0161li or 1800 A.D., these cesses and taxes were all separately leased to one Q\u00e1dir Bakhsh, but so unpopular did he become, that his place was soon taken by a Government darogha, one Maolvi Hasan Ali, in whose time two new taxes were introduced\u2014one of 20 per cent. on transfers of property, and the other of 10 per cent. on mortgages. All land in the town was considered the property of the state, and building sites were sold at their estimated value by the Darogha to intending purchasers, each of whom, however, also had to pay a fee of 2-8 per dwelling to the former j\u00e1g\u00edrdar under the name of t\u00e1w\u00e1n (loss).\n\nThese sources of revenue were discontinued in Sa\u00e1dat Ali\u2019s time, and thereafter the fruit of the mango trees, the loom tax, and the marriage tax were again farmed out at Rs 320 per annum, and they continued to be so farmed till annexation. The native government also continued to collect as a special item of revenue a tax of 8 annas a score on all new cloth as it passed through the hands of the washerman.\n\nMr. Scott, who from the above account appears to have been a great cotton bleacher, seems to have left T\u00e1nda about the close of the last century, and to have been succeeded there by other Europeans.\n\nBetween T\u00e1nda and the town of Mub\u00e1rakpur there is a masonry tomb which bears the inscription marginally transcribed. Mr. Orr is said to have been a paymaster in the British service, and he is still locally remembered as \u201cBakhshi Orr.\u201d He is believed to have introduced great reforms in the manufacture of cotton fabrics at T\u00e1nda, importing patterns of table cloths, towels, &c., from Europe; he also spent much money in improving the art of cloth printing, introducing new designs of fabulous beauty. He built a large mansion and formed native connexions, and the considerable fortune which he realized was afterwards squandered by his sons, who sold the very bricks of which his house was built.\n\nThere was also a Mr. Johannes located at T\u00e1nda, who was apparently a contemporary of Mr. Orr\u2019s. A fine large masonry house still exists to the east of the town, which was built by Mr. Johannes, and the old bridge, the foundations of the piers of which are still to be seen, was constructed by\nhim. The house was mortgaged to a Benares banker, by whom after Mr. Johannes' death, at Mirzapur, it was sold to that gentleman's munshi, by whose family it is still possessed.\n\nThere are the ruins of an Indigo concern in the quarter of the town where these gentlemen lived, but to which of them it belonged is not clear.\n\nIn 1862 there were 1,125 looms in Tanda, but owing to the cotton famine many of the weavers have left, and it is estimated that there are not now more than 875 looms. Each loom when English thread is used will turn out Rs. 212 worth of cloth per annum, of which the weaver's profit will be Rs. 62. If native thread be used the outturn will be Rs. 170 and the profit Rs. 50. Before annexation Tanda sent more than 1\u00bd lacs of rupees worth of cloth to Naip\u00e1l; it does not now send half that quantity.\n\nBazars.\u2014The chief bazars of the pargana are held at the following places, the numerals indicating the number of population:\n\n| Place     | Population |\n|-----------|------------|\n| Tanda     | 11,760     |\n| Khaspur   | 1,134      |\n| Uraht\u00e9    | 773        |\n| Anw\u00e1n     | 591        |\n| Pah\u00e1pur   | 621        |\n\nThe usual half-yearly fairs in honour of the birth and disappearance of Rama are held at Tanda, and the R\u00e1m\u00edl\u00eda festival which commemorates the overthrow by that hero of the diabolical Ravana is also there annually held.\n\nCastes.\u2014The castes of the inhabitants of the pargana are as follows:\n\n1. Musalmans  ...  ...  ...  ...  20 per cent.\n2. Kurmi      ...  ...  ...  ...  14 \"\n3. Brahman    ...  ...  ...  ...  9 \"\n4. Chhattri   ...  ...  ...  ...  2 \"\n5. Other castes ...  ...  ...  ...  55 \"\n\nShrines.\u2014The shrine of Shekh Harawn.\u2014It is affirmed that a holy man named Shekh Harawn came to these parts 500 years ago to convert the pagans, and his efforts at first met with considerable success, but he was eventually put to death, and his tomb, a picturesque one, out of which has grown a large and shady pipal tree, is still pointed out a mile to the east of the town. All local officials on taking office under the native government used to commence their public career by making offerings of cloth and sweetmeats at this shrine, and such were often also offered by all those who had any special wish to gratify. A considerable fair is also held here on the first Sunday of the month of Bh\u00e1don, when the inhabitants for several miles round assemble for the day to the number of 6 or 7,000.\n\nThe im\u00e1mb\u00e1ra of Hus\u00e9n Ali, the grandson of Muhammad Hay\u00e1t, stands a couple of miles to the west of the town, and here the t\u00e1zi\u00e1s are annually buried at the Muharram when 10 or 12,000 persons are said to assemble.\nS\u00e1l\u00e1rgarh.\u2014To the west of the town of T\u00e1n\u1e0da an elevated masonry ch\u00e1b\u00e1t\u0101 or platform has been erected by the Muhammadans of the place where the fall of their sainted champion, Sayyad S\u00e1l\u00e1r, at Bahraich, is annually commemorated in the end of the month of Bais\u00e1kh, when a considerable throng assembles for the day to do honour to his memory.\n\nT\u00c1NDA\u2014Pargana T\u00c1NDA\u2014Tahsil T\u00c1NDA\u2014District FYZABAD.\u2014Latitude 26\u00b0 33' north, longitude 82\u00b0 42' east. This large town lies on the road from Fyzabad to Azamgarh at a distance of 36 miles east of the former. The road from Sultanpur to Gorakhpur also passes through it. Sultanpur is 44 and Gorakhpur 57 miles from this place. The Gogra flows 8 miles to the north. It has large groves to the east. The place is celebrated for its weaving, its manufactures\u2014such as j\u00e1md\u00e1n\u00ed cloth\u2014are said to rival those of Dacca; they value from Rs. 100 to Rs. 150 per piece. The export of cloth is said to amount to Rs. 1,50,000. The chief bazar is that at Hay\u00e1tganj.\n\nIt consists of two towns (Maus-ha also called T\u00e1n\u1e0da and Sakr\u00e1wal); they adjoin and form one. The origin of the name of \"Maus-ha\" is ascribed to a tribe called Muh\u00fasar who inhabited it. T\u00e1n\u1e0da means \"caravan,\" and as caravans used to halt here with their commodities the encamping ground received the name of T\u00e1n\u1e0da. It is now the headquarters of the tahsil and th\u00e1na of the same name. The population is 14,428.\n\n| Musalmans | Sunni | ... | ... | ... | ... | 7,990 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| | Shia | ... | ... | ... | ... | 223 |\n| Hindus | Shaiv\u00ed | ... | ... | ... | ... | 213 |\n| | Sh\u00e1kti | ... | ... | ... | ... | 4,439 |\n| | Vaishnav\u00ed | ... | ... | ... | ... | 1,454 |\n| | N\u00e1nak Sh\u00e1hi | ... | ... | ... | ... | 555 |\n| | Jain or Bar\u00e1wak | ... | ... | ... | ... | 124 |\n\nThere are 3,660 houses, of which 21 are of masonry. There are 44 mosques, 34 im\u00e1mb\u00e1ras, and 9 Hindu temples. There is a good Government school attended mostly by Hindus. There are two fairs\u2014one in honour of S\u00e1l\u00e1r Masa\u00fad, the other for bathing on the K\u00e1rtiki P\u00faranm\u00e1shi.\n\nThe town was granted by Farrukhsiar, king of Delhi, to Hay\u00e1t Khan, taluqdar, and since then the place has flourished. Sa\u00e1dat Ali Khan, of Oudh, was much interested in the prosperity of this town. During the nawabi there was a tahsil, a kotw\u00e1l\u00ed, customs office, and a mufti's court. There were also two banking firms by whom hundis were cashed.\n\nTAPPA ASL Pargana\u2014Tahsil RAIPUR\u2014District SULTANPUR.\u2014This small pargana lies east of Amethi and north of Patti in the Partabgarh district. The area is 67 square miles, of which 32 are cultivated. There are 97 villages, of which 83 belong to the Bachgotis, whose original seat in Oudh lies a few miles south in Patti, and whose chronicles are given under that pargana. There are seven villages owned by Bilkh\u00e1r Chhatris, the predecessors of the Bachgotis. All the villages are owned by zamindars except one. The population consists of 37,183 Hindus and 1,103 Musalmans; it is at the rate of 571 to the square mile. 6,823 are Brahmans, 5,652 or nearly\n16 per cent. are Chhatris, 5,616 are Ahirs, and Chamars are 5,232; high castes are in unusual proportion. The Government demand is Rs. 42,560, being at the rate of Re. 1-4-7 per acre of arable land. This moderate assessment is no doubt necessary, considering the nature of the population. The summary settlement was Rs. 36,893.\n\nThis pargana was formerly called Mangra Martha; it was taken possession of by Asl R\u00e9e, son of Bariar Singh, the leader of the Bachgotis; he called it after his own name. The landed property is thus divided:\n\n| Taluqdari | Zamindari | Total |\n|-----------|-----------|-------|\n| Bachgoti  |           | 83    |\n| Bhikharis |           | 6     |\n| Other castes |       | 7     |\n\nTARGAON\u2014Pargana HARHA\u2014Tahsil UNAO\u2014District UNAO.\u2014Latitude 26\u00b036' north, longitude 80\u00b046' east. This village is six miles east of the civil station. The road leading from Unao to Purwa passes about one mile from it on the north. The river Lon flows about one mile south of the town. There was a forest here before the existence of this village of t\u00e1r (palm) trees. About 400 years ago one T\u00e1ra Singh, Chhattri, resident of Jaitipur, tahsil Mohan, of this district, came here hunting, and being delighted with the appearance of the place built a house, and thus having gradually got all the jungle cleared founded this village and called it T\u00e1rgaon. It may take its name from the t\u00e1r trees, but is equally possible that it may have taken its name from its founder T\u00e1ra Singh. Soil, clay and sand. The surface level and scenery beautiful. There is no forest, but mango and mahua trees abound. Climate healthy. Water both sweet and brackish. There is still existing one noted building called Qila Garhi, which was erected by the founder of the village. There is a school here and two markets weekly. The place is noted for the manufacture of glass bracelets, which the women of this country wear on their wrists.\n\n| Population. |\n|-------------|\n| Hindus      | 4,459 |\n| Muhammadans | 78    |\n| Total       | 4,537 |\n\nIn the T\u00e1rganj bazar the annual sales amount to Rs. 2,400.\n\nThere are 871 mud-built houses, and one of masonry, seven temples, viz. three shiw\u00e1las, three masonry platforms without any superstructure, dedicated to Mah\u00e1deo, and one to Debi.\n\nTERHA\u2014Pargana GH\u00c1TAMPUR\u2014Tahsil PURWA\u2014District UNAO.\u2014Terha lies 18 miles south of Purwa and 25 south-east of Unao. A country road to Baksar passes through it. The Ganges flows six miles to the south. It is said to have been founded 2,000 years ago by Tori Mal, a descendant of R\u00e1ja Pann, a Bhar chief. It is pleasantly situated among numerous groves. There is a school here at which 39 boys are taught Urdu and N\u00e1gri. Population amounts to 2,755, of whom 1,262 are Brahmans and 42 Musalmans. There are four temples, two to Mah\u00e1deo and two in honour of Debi.\nTH\u00c1NA\u2014Pargana UNAO\u2014Tahsil UNAO\u2014District UNAO.\u2014Th\u00e1na, a village in the pargana and tahsil of Unao, lies about five miles north-west of it. An unmetalled road passes through it from Unao leading on to Hardoi. Excepting Unao there is no other large town near. In the year 887 A.H., in the time of the Emperor Akbar, two persons, Th\u00e1n Singh and P\u00faran Singh, Chauh\u00e1n Th\u00e1kurs of Mainpuri, came here from Delhi with the Subahdar of Oudh, and in obedience to his orders had all the jungle cut down, settled here, and founded this village, calling it after the name of Th\u00e1n Singh.\n\nOne Bh\u00edm Singh, the great grandfather of Jodh\u00e1 Singh and Hukum Singh, present lambardars, was a very shrewd and ambitious native of this village. He lived in the reign of Nawab Sa\u00e1dat Ali Khan, and was during his life taluqdar and ruler of the country. The people are generally Hindus, some few Muhammadans.\n\nThere is one fort constructed by Th\u00e1n Singh. There is one school; but no th\u00e1na or talsil. There is a small daily market and two weekly large ones; annual amount of sales about 2,000 rupees.\n\nPopulation 2,994, as follows:\n\n| Community | Number |\n|-----------|--------|\n| Musalmans | 128    |\n| Brahmins  | 149    |\n| Chhattris | 415    |\n| F\u00e1ris    | 58     |\n| Ahirs    | 179    |\n| Other tribes | 2,070 |\n\nTotal 3,994\n\nThere are 388 mud-walled houses and three of masonry; one mosque.\n\nTHULENDI\u2014Pargana BACHHR\u00c1W\u00c1N\u2014Tahsil DIGBIJAIGANJ\u2014District RA\u00c9 BARELI.\u2014This town stands 10 miles west of the tahsil station and 14 miles north-west of the civil station. It is 18 miles south of Bhilwal, 18 south-west of Haidargarh, and 32 miles south-east of Lucknow. It was founded by Th\u00edla, a Bhar chief, who was in possession of this estate, and therefore it is called Thulendi. Malik T\u00e1j-ud-d\u00edn, the companion of S\u00e1l\u00e1r Masa\u00fad, named it Maliknagar when he obtained possession of it after the annihilation of the Bhars; but this name did not remain long, for the Bhars again got possession of this estate and put Malik T\u00e1j-ud-d\u00edn to death. The exact date of the foundation of this town cannot be ascertained, but the existence of the tombs of Malik T\u00e1j-ud-d\u00edn and other martyrs leads to the supposition that it has been in existence more than 800 years. It was one of the five muh\u00e1ls into which Rae Bareli was divided by Akbar Shah, but the name of the pargana was changed by the British Government to Bachhr\u00e1w\u00e1n. The soil is chiefly clay. The site is on an elevated plain, the inhabited part is bounded on all sides by groves. There are two large tanks on the northern and southern limits. The climate is in general salubrious. The Jaunpur king, Sultan Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm, had a mud-built fort here in 820 Hijri, which was made the residence of the Collector, but R\u00e1ja Niw\u00e1z Singh, Brahman, the chakladar of this place,\ntransferred the seat of Government to Bachhr\u00e1w\u00e1n. The population of the town increased much during the time of the abovementioned R\u00e1ja Niw\u00e1z Singh, who was a native of this town. At present it is far from being in a flourishing state. Of the architectural works there is the fort built by Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm of Jaunpur, two masonry mosques, and a house of R\u00e1ja Niw\u00e1z Singh, also two mud-built tanks constructed by Malik T\u00e1j-ud-d\u00edn under the name of \"bara hauz\" (large reservoir) and \"chhota hauz\" (small reservoir). The population of the town amounts to 3,157, of which 2,085 are Musalmans, principally of the Sunni sect and Hanafi sub-class.\n\nOf Hindus there are 531 Brahmans, 16 Chhattirs, and 46 K\u00e1yaths\u2014in all 593. These belong to the Shaivi creed. The remainder of the population (1,506) is composed of lower castes. There are 17 brick-built houses and 651 mud-built ones. There is a Government vernacular school here. There are five Hindu temples in honour of Mah\u00e1deo, and also a serai built by R\u00e1ja Niw\u00e1z Singh, but this has now fallen into ruins. A market is held in this town on Sundays and Thursdays, and the value of the articles sold amounts to about 333 rupees.\n\nA fair is held here on the first Friday in Jeth (April-May) in honour of S\u00e1l\u00e1r Masa\u00fad. The Musalmans of the neighbourhood bring their banners and lodge here for one night, and then proceed to Satr\u00edkh and Behraich where great fairs in honour of the same martyr take place. The gathering in this town amounts on that night to 4,000 souls, and the sale of necessary articles to 250 rupees.\n\nTIKAITGANJ AND MAUSAR\u2014Pargana KURSI\u2014Tahsil FAT\u00c9HPUR\u2014District BARA BANKL\u2014Mausar is situated some two miles to the north of Kursi on the road to Mahmudabad. It is held three parts by Musalmans, Maliks, and Shekhs, and one by Kurmis. The origin of the name of the town is fanciful enough. It is said to have belonged to one of four Bhar brothers, who each named a village from an article in daily domestic use; to this musal (a pestle) gave its name. The remaining three were named from a mortar, a mill, and an oven\u2014ukhli, chakia, chella. The village is built on an elevated site probably raised by the old Bhar inhabitants, and below it on the north is a huge well built of slabs of kankar, also ascribed to the Bhars. The Muhammadans perhaps drove out the Bhars. The Malik proprietors say that they came with the first Musalman invader Sayyad Masa\u00fad under Malik Muhammad Shar\u00edf, a prince of the kingdom of Ir\u00e1n, and that Sayyad N\u00far \u00c1l\u00ed Shah was killed here. There is a tomb here built to his memory, and he is revered as a Shah\u00edd or martyr. There is no trace of the Kurmis' coming; they could not have been the first inhabitants, for they would not have subsisted side by side with their conquerors who were carrying on a war of extermination. The tradition about Malik Muhammad Shar\u00edf is doubtful. The Shekhs say that he came in the time of Taim\u00far Shah in 785 Hijri (A.D. 1368), and probably the Muhammadan colonization is not earlier than this. The population is 4,241, but a great part of this is made up of the residents of Tikaitganj, a market-place, that was founded by Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja Tikait R\u00e1\u00e9, the famous Diw\u00e1n of \u00c1sif-ud-daula.\nThe market-place lies on the road from Mahmudabad to Kursi, and long rows of Bani\u00e1n's shops line the road on each side, and the annual sales of its bi-weekly bazars are said to amount to Rs. 16,000.\n\nTIKAITNAGAR\u2014Pargana DARYABAD\u2014Taksil RAM SANEHI GHAT\u2014District BARA BANKI.\u2014Twenty-four miles east north-east of the civil station, founded about 80 years ago by Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja Tikait R\u00e1e, K\u00e1yath, Naib of Nawab \u00c1sif-ud-daula, in 1192 fa\u0161li (A.D. 1784). He seems to have been a man of great public spirit; he established two ganjes and bazars at Lucknow, one at Calcutta, one at Kursi, and another at Dalmau on the Ganges. This is the largest mart in the district, and great quantities of grain are brought from the trans-Gogra districts and sold here. The town of Daryabad four miles south is fed from this bazar; Thursdays and Sundays are the market days. A brisk manufacture, of brazen vessels is carried on. The conservancy and town police are paid from the octroi. The town is infested with monkeys.\n\nTILOKPUR\u2014Pargana RAMNAGAR\u2014Taksil FATEHPUR\u2014District BARA BANKI.\u2014Fourteen miles north of the civil station founded by R\u00e1ja Tilok Chand Bais; is noted for its bazar, where cloth is sold in large quantities. Longitude 81\u00b020', latitude 27\u00b012'.\n\nTIRBEDIGANJ\u2014Pargana HAIDARGARH\u2014Taksil HAIDARGARH\u2014District BARA BANKI.\u2014This town lies not far from Ans\u00e1ri on the road from Lucknow to Sultanpur, four miles south of the Gumti. Its original name is Tirhinga, but R\u00e1ja Th\u00e1kur Singh Tirbedi, a high officer of the native Government, bought it from the R\u00e1ja of Pukhra Ans\u00e1ri, and settled many new inhabitants calling the place after his own name. This was eighteen years before annexation in 1254 Hijri (A.D. 1837). The soil is loam; the country is rather bare of trees; there is a small bazar, a temple to Mah\u00e1deo, and a population of 2,397.\n\nTULSIPUR Pargana*\u2014Taksil UTRAULA\u2014District GONDA.\u2014Bounded all along the north by the lower range of the Himalayas, to the east by the \u00c1ra n\u00e1la, which divides it from district Basti in the North-West Provinces, on the south by Balr\u00e1mpur, and on the west by district Bahraich, this enormous pargana presents the most varied natural features. All along the hills stretches the conserved Government forest, which is followed by undulating ground, slightly higher to the west than to the east. This is intersected by numerous hill torrents, which are confined by cliffs varying in height, but generally sufficient to preserve the neighbourhood from floods. The soil of this strip is usually of an excellent heavy loam, fertilized by leaf mould washed down from the forests; but it is exceedingly unhealthy, the population very scanty, and the cultivation of the lowest class, such crops as there are, being exposed to the depredations of the wild animals which swarm in the adjoining jungles. The great bog to the east which forms the body of the pargana is a level plain considerably lower than the strip under the hills. The best part of this is to the east of the Bhambh\u00e1r n\u00e1la which is least subject to\n\n* By Mr. W. C. Benett, C.S., Assistant Commissioner.\ndestructive inundations, and to the centre at least under fairly good cultivation.\n\nThe soil is of a stiff clay and yields in profusion the finest kinds of autumn and winter rice. The tract to the west of this is not only much underpopulated but is exposed to the constant overflows from the mountain streams. These deposit every rains, sometimes at one place and sometimes at another, thick layers of white sand through which the field ridges of former rice cultivation just show. It takes years of patient and unremitting labour\u2014or, that rare event, the deposit of a layer of mud\u2014to reclaim these for the plough. Here and there, among the sandy or barely inhabited villages, an exception may be found recalling the careful rice cultivation and heavy clay of the Bhambar division. All along the south, where this pargana abuts on the Burhi Rapti, there is a barren almost uninhabited plain covered with high khar grass, which might be useful were there any houses near to be thatched.\n\nThroughout the pargana the mango groves, which form so pleasing a feature in Oudh scenery, are almost wanting, and when the rice crops are off the ground, the eye may often travel for miles over a hard grey clay plain, cut up by the high ridges of rice fields with no middle distance between the spectator and the hills, but perhaps a party of vultures discussing the remains of a victim to the cattle plague.\n\nThe whole pargana, from the stiffness of the soil and the necessary incidents of rice cultivation, is during the rains under water, and for this reason villages are built only on the few slightly raised spots which escape the surrounding floods. The population is consequently closely packed and the streets filthy, the neighbouring air being fetid with the poisonous exhalations of putrefying cattle carcasses. Mud huts are rather the conventional luxury of the higher than an object of ambition to the lower classes, who are for the most part contented with miserable sheds of straw hurdles and leaves; and constant fires destroy whole villages without, if the grain store be saved, materially injuring the wealth of the inhabitants. The seeds of disease are easily engendered in these crowded and unclean habitations, and combine with the malaria of the Tarai to render fever and dysentery endemic. The worst time is of course in November and December while the rains are drying up, but the scourge is not wholly absent at any time of the year. The feeble population, already predisposed to receive the germs of sickness, collects for the Debi Patan fair, where it meets pilgrims from the hills and the plains. A crowded encampment is defiled by the refuse of hideous bloody sacrifices, and often scattered before the conclusion of the festival by the appearance of virulent cholera. This is conveyed to the opium gatherings at Fyzabad, and may spread thence over the whole province. It is satisfactory that the careful sanitary arrangements of last year entirely prevented the occurrence of this terrible epidemic.\n\nThere are no communications, unless an unmetalled road made by Major Hill of the frontier police, immediately after the mutiny from Pattali to Tulsipur, which carts have here and there to take a circuit of miles\nto avoid, be called a means of communication. The unusual height of the boundary ridges everywhere, and to the north the precipitous sides of the hill torrents, render locomotion very difficult, and the district officer would do well to ride himself on an elephant, and send his goods on camels. The grain carts which convey the large exports to Nawabganj wind painfully from village to village, and do not cross the R\u00e1pti till they have suffered many an upset and many a broken axle-tree.\n\nThe whole area of the pargana as originally constituted amounted to 324,583 acres, of which 200,435 were under cultivation. Within the last few years an area of 39,914 acres, of which 18,923 are cultivated, have been transferred from Gonda to B\u00e1draich. Of the whole tilled area 119,495 acres are under autumn and 94,330 under spring crops. 33,030 bear a double harvest, leaving the large margin of 19,640 acres for new fallow. The minute rice fields are protected by high ridges of stiff clay to prevent the rain water being drained off into the B\u00farhi R\u00e1pti, but artificial irrigation is hardly ever resorted to, and wells except for drinking purposes are practically unknown.\n\nThe area in acres under each principal crop is shown in the following table:\n\n|                  | Winter rice. | Autumn rice | M\u00e1sh or urd. |\n|------------------|--------------|-------------|--------------|\n| Kharif           | 54,330       | 18,680      | 10,220       |\n\n|                  | Wheat.       | Barley.     | Gram.        | L\u00e1hl. | Mas\u00far. |\n|------------------|--------------|-------------|--------------|-------|--------|\n| Rabi             | 14,570       | 10,615      | .15,425      | 12,520| 5,355  |\n\nGram, peas, and mas\u00far are generally sown in the outlying lands at a distance from the village site, the fields are roughly broken up with a spade, and the grain sown broadcast. As rents are taken in kind a return of anything above threefold of the sowing repays the cultivator, and the abundance of waste land is utilized for the minimum of profit.\n\nThe power of the r\u00e1jas and their distance from the central authority kept the Government land revenue during native rule at a very low proportion to the real rent of the pargana. In 1800 A.D. it amounted to Rs. 75,649, and for the next 28 years it fluctuated between Rs. 42,000 and Rs. 70,000. In 1828 A.D. the r\u00e1ja got the grant of a perpetual lease at Rs. 62,759 from the Oudh Government, which remained in force, with the exception of two years (1854 and 1855), till annexation. The amount of the r\u00e1ja's profits may be conjectured from the fact that in those years, when the contumacy of Drigr\u00e1j Singh induced the Lucknow government to attempt to collect the rents direct from the village heads, the pargana was assessed at Rs. 1,87,395 and Rs. 2,19,064. At summary settlement the revenue was fixed at Rs. 1,45,003, and at the revised settle-\nment in 1871 this was raised to Rs. 2,05,360, which as a special mark of favour to the Maharajas is to be confirmed for perpetuity. Of this Rs. 18,420 are assessed on the 32 villages which have been transferred to Bahraich. The revenue falls at the rate of one rupee to the acre of cultivation, and ten annas per acre of whole area, each head of population contributing nearly two rupees. The area under opium appears to be steadily increasing as the average production is declining in quantity. From 1866 to 1870 the average area was 342 bighas (226\u00bd acres), while the average produce was 4\u00bd sers per bigha, the area rose in 1871 to 470 bighas and in 1872 to 550, and the average yield per bigha fell to 3 sers 13\u00bd chhat\u00e1ks.\n\nThe absence of any great market and the difficulty of communication renders grain very much cheaper here than in any other part of Gonda. The harvests of 1870 A.D. were about equally good all over the district, and in January, 1871 A.D., when the rice had reached the market, it was sold in Nawabganj at 100lbs., while at the same time in Tulsipur it varied from 145 to 150lbs. to the rupee. Nor is this to be wondered at as the cultivator sells from his threshing-floor to a small speculator from the south, who has to make his own profit and in addition pay for the expenses of his cart and cattle to and fro\u2014a journey generally lasting about a fortnight. He sells to the Nawabganj grain merchant, and the price of money in grain at Tulsipur is compounded of the ordinary price at Nawabganj as settled by the supply and demand there, plus the Nawabganj dealer's profits, plus the interest on the capital of the small speculator, and the rateable expenses of keeping himself and his cattle for a fortnight, and the repairs to his cart. In spite of this, the richness of the soil, and the immense size of the individual cultivator's tenements, due to the sparseness of the population, result in a large export trade, which the tolerable certainty of the rain supply elevates into almost imperial importance. The rice is of the finest quality produced in India, and is famous from the bazars of Dehli to the cotton districts of the Central Provinces. The local markets are Pachperwa in the Bhambhar division and Tulsipur proper. At neither of these is there any great trade beyond what is sufficient to supply the neighbouring villagers with their coarse cotton clothes and pots and pans. Both were till quite lately resorted to by considerable numbers of hillmen from Naip\u00e1l, but Sir Jang Bahadur makes a large revenue from market dues, and to increase that has forbidden exports. Now any small trade that exists between the two countries is transacted via the Jarwa pass at Deokhar, or over the Parasr\u00e1mpur and Tiknia Gh\u00e1ts on the Ara n\u00e1la and the B\u00farhi R\u00e1pti at Kapt\u00e1nganj, both Naip\u00e1l\u00e9se bazars. The next import of any importance is the l\u00e1hi, a good quality of oil seed, which is sent in considerable quantities to the Nawabganj bazar, whence it is conveyed by river to Patna and other Bengal markets. Cow hides are in the same way exported both by the R\u00e1pti and the Gogra to Lower Bengal, and there are dep\u00f4ts for this trade at Gonda and Nawabganj connected with leading native houses at Patna and Calcutta.\n\nAt the end of February parties of low-caste Hindus, generally Ch\u00e1\u00eds, come to the forest to manufacture catechu. A khair tree is cut down,\nand about three feet of the thickest part of the trunk fixed upright in the ground; the bark and outer part of the wood are then cleared off, and the heart cut up into small fragments. These chips are collected and set to boil in brick pans, built in rows of ten or twelve along the ground, and heated from underneath. When the water becomes sufficiently red the fibre is cleared away, and the juice allowed to thicken by evaporation. At the end of two days boiling nothing is left in the pan but a dark red sediment, which is formed into cakes about four inches square, and taken for sale to the nearest markets. The price at the place of manufacture averages a rupee for 4\u00bd lbs., which is about a third of its ordinary bazar price in Oudh. A few professional dealers attend at the spot to make purchases, but the greater part is taken away by the manufacturers themselves.\n\nThere are no imports of any kind but salt, which is very expensive, and coined silver.\n\nOwing to the thinness of the population which secures good terms for the agriculturist, and the large excess of production, the people are generally well to do, and beggary is unknown except in the case of professional mendicants who arrive from the southern districts. Crime is rare, the principal offence being adultery, the natural concomitant of the impotence resulting from the malarious air, the guilty couple generally manage to evade punishment by a voluntary expatriation, and small colonies of genial criminals on the other side of the Naip\u00e1l frontier smile at the baffled efforts of deserted husbands.\n\nThe edge of the forest produces a small breed of cattle. Immense herds of these wander about under the charge of one or two shepherds, and do incalculable damage to the young trees in March or April. When the plains are dried up, and pasturage becomes scanty, the herds are driven into Naip\u00e1l or to one or two small table-lands which exist on this side of the hills. At the commencement of the rains they return to their Tulsipur villages. In October and November they are generally attacked by disease, and after a heavy or late rainy season the victims are innumerable. The carcasses are left to the crows and vultures on the open plain, and the air is poisoned with the stench of rotten flesh. Only the oxen are sold, and they are rarely large enough for draught. Ordinary calves of a year to eighteen months fetch from Rs. 8 to Rs. 10, and the best Rs. 30 to Rs. 35 the pair, and are used for ploughing and stamping out the grain. The worst and most common form of disease is that known as \"jh\u00e1nk.\" It begins with violent diarrhoea, and the animal affected rejects food, but shows a craving for water. In two or three days it becomes unable to stand from weakness, worms are formed in its nostrils, eyes, and ears, and within four or five days of the commencement of the disease it dies. Recoveries are known, but they are exceedingly rare, and whole flocks will be carried off within a few weeks by this terrible pestilence.\n\nThe population numbers 104,454, which, excluding from the calculation the uninhabited tract of Government forest, gives an average of 206 souls to the square mile. It is distributed over 387 demarcated villages,\nand census gave 128 hamlets and detached houses, whereas the settlement returns, which had the advantage of being compiled after the revenue survey, show no less than 252 separate hamlets in addition to the main villages; 13,774 or 13 per cent. of the whole population are Muhammadans, and the proportion of females to a hundred males is with the Hindus 93\u00b76 and with the Muhammadans 93\u00b79. There are no towns or considerable villages, the largest being Tulsipur with a population of 2,292. Of the Hindu castes the Ahirs, who in addition to field work tend the great herds of Tarai cattle, head the list; next to them and about half as numerous are the Kurmis; Brahmins and Koris are the only other classes which occur in any numbers.\n\nThe most singular tribe in this pargana are the Tharus, whose flat faces, scanty beards, and high cheek bones prove their Turanian origin. They arrogate for themselves a descent from the Rajputs of Chittor, and history acquaints us with more than one emigration northward from that fortress. The peculiar Mongolian physiognomy is not so strongly marked with them as with the lower classes of Naipalese and Thibetans, and it is very possible that they may be descended from a Chattri horde which intermarried with aboriginal women. It is said that they have a separate language, of which however I was unable to get any specimens, as those settled in the plains speak a bad Hindi. They are still the pioneers of civilization, and can never be induced to remain in fully cultivated tracts. The tilled plain is distasteful with them, and they retreat with the retreating forest. Legend ascribes to them the possession of the secret of treasures buried by their forefathers ages ago, and villages are pointed out in the southern parganas in which they and their forests have long given way to the agriculture of the Hindu, where vast amounts of the precious metals are supposed to be still concealed. It is even said that parties of Tharus have descended from the Tarai, and at the dead of night carried off their hidden inheritance; but of this I know no authentic instance.\n\nPork divides them into two classes, the Dangaria and the Kateria, of which the first indulges, the second refrains, but except this, and flesh of the cow, all meat is lawful to all the members of the community. Fowls are their favourite food, and they are famous for the production of fine capons, an art unknown in the plain. They are great drinkers, preferring a liquor distilled by themselves from rice, but I have seen quite a small party dispose of six bottles of rum and one of brandy undiluted in a very short time and with infinite satisfaction.\n\nTheir houses are built of screens of leaves and grass, and one house serves for one family, being easily enlarged to suit its natural increase. The beds are arranged in rows against each wall with a screen between each bed, and a path between the rows terminating in the door, of which there is never more than one to each hut. They build square wells to a considerable depth walled by strong plants of the sakhu wood, dovetailed at the corners, and the whole village joins in accomplishing this common benefit. Their only manufacture is strong coarse mats made of the fine bankas grass, which they gather in great quantities on the lower hills.\nfrom January till March, and which serves for a hundred useful purposes, forming excellent twine and rope.\n\nCheerful, brave, modest, and truthful, their character presents some pleasant contrasts to that of their more civilized neighbours. Their honesty is vouched for by a hundred stories, and it is said that when a family flies into the hills they will always leave any arrears of rent that may be due tied up in a rag to the lintel of their deserted house. Their bravery is proved by their love of the chase, though it does not appear in their singular contrivance for killing tigers. A trench is dug, and in this the carcass of a cow is placed, attached to the cow is a string, which is securely fastened at the other end to a plank laid across the trench. This plank supports a pile of heavy blocks of wood, and when the tiger pulls away the cow, the heavy booby trap descends, and if it does not kill sufficiently, disables him to allow of the Th\u00e1rus coming up and despatching him.\n\nThe women of the Th\u00e1rus are credited with the power of the evil eye, and the dread thus excited is most efficacious in keeping Hindus out of their villages. The magic is of two kinds or rather degrees, the major curse being known as \"lohn\u00e1,\" which commences with violent wasting away and results invariably in a rapid death. From the lesser, known as \"bej,\" recovery may be expected; it displays itself in a low fever accompanied with diarrhoea. The fever and dysentery of the Tar\u00e1 keep the superstition alive. Both men and animals are supposed to be subject to this malignant influence; but a handsome bachelor is considered the most likely victim,\u2014a belief in which we see something of the love magic of the Thracian witches. The souls of those who are thus affected remain forever in the power of the enchantress, and when she dies she becomes a \"bhukhm,\" a malignant demon commanding a troop of the souls she has slain. Among the lower castes of Hindus, and especially the Kewats and Ch\u00e1is, whose traditional descent from the Kaivartas or Nishad\u00e1s stamps them as non-aryan, are found individuals who possess the secret antidote to this fascination. At Pipra Gh\u00e1t on the R\u00e1pti, between Utraula and Tulsipur, there is an especially famous \"Jhari\" or exorciser of the carpenter class, who has a large school of pupils. He receives patients every Tuesday, and by observing a grain of mustard seed placed in the open hand can at once detect the kind and the degree of the possession. His frequent cures are attested by the crowds which attend his receptions, and by the direct testimony of trustworthy witnesses. From the description given of his treatment, I should conjecture that he employed a kind of mesmerism, which would no doubt prove occasionally effectual where the natural virulence of the disease has been greatly aided by a superstitious terror of witchcraft.\n\nBefore leaving the subject of the women, it is curious to remark that a girl is considered to belong to no one till she marries, and a father is absolutely indifferent to what his unmarried daughters do or hear. One of the principal branches of Hindustani abuse has thus for him no sting. Girls are generally married at the age of sixteen or seventeen, and the marriage bond does not set heavy, as friends will often exchange wives\nin a spirit of mutual accommodation. Their dance is national and peculiar. A boy of fifteen or sixteen is dressed as a woman, and his partner beats a small drum suspended from the neck. The pair advance and retreat with a gliding motion, and represent with coarse fidelity the advances of the lover and the coyness of the maid. As they proceed they warm to the work, and I shall never forget the ecstatic but somewhat ludicrous rapture which shone in the face and spoke in every limb of the drummer after two hours of the exercise, and the infusion of a large amount of raw spirits. Every now and then the dancing gives place to a dramatic interlude in which a dullard is made the butt of the rough and occasionally obscene wit of the leading actor. These scenes are invariably the vehicle of satire, and the Brahmans of the plains, and Sir Jang Bah\u00e1dur of Naip\u00e1l, were visited with unsparing ridicule. Women never take a part in the representation. Their fondness for dancing is shown at weddings. When the principal negotiator of the match dances before the train which fetches the bride to her husband's village. Their principal object of worship is K\u00e1li under various forms, but ordinarily as the goddess of demonical possession, with the title Sonmat K\u00e1lika, and to her they offer spirits and the young of pigs and goats. Next in popular estimation is Garur B\u00edf, the ancient cloud god, an enemy of Vitra, the demon of drought, better known in modern Hindu legend as the bird-vehicle of Vishnu. To him they offer cocks, cutting of the comb and wattles and letting the bird loose in the forest. Raksha Gur\u00fa and Daharchandi are among the minor deities; the first receives offerings of goats and the second is the guardian of the village site, and is represented by a clump of low wooden crosses at the verge of the cultivation by the path where the cattle leave the village.\n\nThere is no peculiar religious caste, and Brahmans are held in no estimation, except that some of the Kateria division which claims superior respectability, have recourse to Pandits for fixing lucky moments. The whole family is represented in worship by its eldest member, who alone possesses the secret of the religious ceremonial, a custom which makes any enquiry into their rites somewhat difficult. Their Gur\u00fas or oracles are people of any class on whom K\u00e1li may have descended, and the presence of the deity is revealed by frenzied motions of the head or hands. They burn their dead, and, when the mountain torrents are swollen by rain, cast the ashes on the waters.\n\nThere can be little doubt that this interesting and peculiar race will soon disappear from this side of the hills. Their numbers in Gonda have already been reduced to barely three thousand, and yearly decrease through emigration into Naip\u00e1l. Till quite lately the whole of the country between the R\u00e9pti and the hills was a vast s\u00e1l forest, interspersed here and there with small colonies of Th\u00e1rus, under their own rulers and peculiar laws, who preserved a semi-independence by paying a double tribute, the dakhinaha, to the southern authorities, the R\u00e1ja of Balr\u00e1mpur, or the Oudh government, and the uttarai to the hill r\u00e1jas of D\u00e1ng, who afterwards were better known as R\u00e1jas of Tulsipur. Under hereditary chaudhr\u00eds the original inhabitants had divided the pergana into the eight tappes of\nBhambh\u00e1r, Bijaipur, P\u00edpra, Dhondi, Gar\u00e1wan, Dond, Chaurahia, and D\u00e1ri, separated from each other by as many hill streams, and defended against aggression by strong mud forts. The first of the family of hill Chauh\u00e1ns, who ruled a vast r\u00e1j in Naip\u00e1l covering three lower valleys of the lower Himalayan ranges, was Megh R\u00e1j, who, if the legend connected with his name is of any value, must have lived in the latter half of the fourteenth century. It is said that as he was one day hunting in the forest he wounded a deer, who proclaimed himself to be the great Ratan N\u00e1th, third in descent from Gorakh N\u00e1th, the founder of modern jogism. In return for his profuse apologies the disguised saint prophesied that his offspring should rule for 84 kos, as far as his eye could stretch.\n\nFor many centuries his descendants ruled in the hills receiving their tribute from the plain Th\u00e1rus. About a hundred years ago R\u00e1ja Pirithp\u00e1l Singh of Balr\u00e1mpur died, and his rightful heir, Newal Singh, was driven out by his cousin, the Bhayy\u00e1 of Kalw\u00e1ri, and took refuge in the hills. The Chauh\u00e1n r\u00e1ja placed at his disposal a force of 2,000 Th\u00e1rus, who drove out the usurper, and replaced Newal Singh on the gaddi of Balr\u00e1mpur. Not many years after this the same hill r\u00e1ja was himself driven into the plains by the powerful ruler of Naip\u00e1l, and found refuge with his old ally, R\u00e1ja Newal Singh of Balr\u00e1mpur, who requited his services by putting down the resistance of the Th\u00e1rus of Tulsipur, and assuring the fugitive Chauh\u00e1n in a chieftainship not inferior to the one he had just lost. In return for this, and in acknowledgment of some vague zamindari claims, Newal Singh of Tulsipur agreed to pay the Balr\u00e1mpur r\u00e1ja an annual tribute of Rs. 1,500. His son, Dalel Singh, continued the payment, but when D\u00e1n Bah\u00e1dur Singh succeeded to the chieftainship he asserted that it was due only as remuneration for military aid, which he could now dispense with, and declined to pay it any longer. This led to a long war with Balr\u00e1mpur, which up to annexation was renewed with varied success whenever a favourable opportunity presented itself. As a general rule, as far as I can make out, the gratitude of the Tulsipur r\u00e1ja was stronger than his pride, and the subsidy was paid without demur. In 1828 A.D., the Governor-General made a hunting expedition in the Tulsipur Tar\u00e1\u00ed, and in reward for the sport induced the king of Oudh to give the r\u00e1ja a perpetual lease of the whole pargana at a fixed annual rent. After a long reign, remarkable rather for its material prosperity than its wars, D\u00e1n Bah\u00e1dur Singh died in 1845 A.D., not without suspicion of violence from his son, Drigr\u00e1j Singh, who succeeded him in the chieftainship. The crime if committed was more than avenged, and the reign of Drigr\u00e1j Singh was embittered and cut short by the rebellion of his son, Drig Nar\u00e1in Singh, who in 1850 A.D. drove his father to seek refuge with the R\u00e1ja of Balr\u00e1mpur. The dispossessed chieftain sought and obtained assistance at Lucknow, and supported by the Government engagement and a small body of Government troops recovered his power for a few months in 1855 A.D. He was however unable permanently to resist his son, who defeated him, and, after a short imprisonment, had him carried off by poison. The unnatural conflict was brought about partly by the lust of rule, which would not let the younger chief wait till the succession became lawfully his, and partly by a disgraceful dispute between the father and the son for\nthe possession of a celebrated Lucknow courtezan. At annexation Drig Narain Singh declined to pay his revenue, and was apprehended by the Commissioner and sent under guard to Lucknow, while the pargana was settled with the village heads, 10 per cent. on the collections being reserved for the raja's maintenance. In the meantime the mutiny broke out, and the captive was shut up with the British force in the Residency at Lucknow, where the hardship of the siege put an end to his life. His Rani seized the reins of power, and her first act was to imprison Pirhipal Singh, the next in succession to the raja, and Ram Singh, the general of her husband's forces, whom she suspected of having treacherously betrayed their master in order to secure the pargana for themselves, finding it inconvenient to keep a continual guard over them, she had the hut in which they were imprisoned set on fire, and they perished in the flames.\n\nDuring the whole of the mutiny she remained in arms, and at the conclusion joined the broken forces of Bal\u00e1 Rao Maratha, the Begam, R\u00e1ja Debi Bakhsh Singh of Gonda, and the N\u00e1zm Muhammad Hasan Khan in their last futile stand under the hills. Driven with them across the Naip\u00e1l frontier, she was unable to trust the promised amnesty of the British Government, and her contumacious absence was punished by the confiscation of her estates, which were conferred, in reward for his unshaken loyalty, on the Mah\u00e1raja of Belr\u00e1mpur. No changes have occurred since, except that the strip that runs under the Government forests between the hill stream known as the Hattia Kund, and the Bhagora T\u00e1l, has been transferred to Bahraich. It contains 32 large but thinly populated villages, and includes the old tappas of Chaur\u00e1hia and D\u00e1ri, and part of Dond.\n\nThe old Chauh\u00e1n r\u00e1jas seem hardly to have been recognized as pure Chhattirs by their brethren of the plain, and though a daughter of their house on one occasion married a raja of Par\u00e1spur, such relations were almost always contracted with the inhabitants of Naip\u00e1l. A peculiar family institution reminds us of the Th\u00e1kurs of Rajput\u00e1na, and each of the hill princes was surrounded by numbers of illegitimate children and connexions. These were known as Khetas and Khetis, and filled the principal posts in the army and private abode of their chief. A bloody, distrustful, and capricious race, the service was attended with considerable danger, and one head agent after another was murdered in cold blood, as soon as his wealth excited the cupidity or his influence the fear of his master.\n\nIn their dealings with the peasantry they seem to have been more enlightened, and the prosperity and wealth of the country, only now partially recovered from fire and sword of the fugitive mutineers, are recalled with enthusiasm, and may be easily believed. Absolutely independent, except for the payment of his annual tribute, the raja was able to make his own internal arrangements without the fear of seeing them upset by an extortionate N\u00e1zm from Lucknow, and his object was permanent wealth rather than immediate profit. Each tappa had its separate\nrent collector with his staff of only two chapr\u00e1sis, and if he attempted any kind of extortion he was immediately exposed by the \"Panches,\" of whom two or three were appointed to each division for the maintenance of order and decision of civil disputes. The unsatisfactory system of assigning land in payment of service was carefully avoided, and every retainer received his fixed and for the circumstances of the times liberal pecuniary stipend. Intermediate between the r\u00e1ja and the cultivator were the old Th\u00e1ru chaudhr\u00eds where Th\u00e1rus yet existed, and in other villages the usually hereditary headmen who, besides slight privileges on their own cultivation, received a percentage generally amounting to one-tenth on the whole grain division of the village. Each member of the society was supported by fixed shares of the produce, the servants first taking their dues, and the remainder being divided into equal heaps\u2014one for the cultivator, the other for the r\u00e1ja and village headmen. At the head of the servants came the ploughmen, who received one-fifth of the gross outturn of their master's fields. After them the blacksmith, who was paid 18 panser\u00eds (a panseri being equal to something less than 2lbs. avoirdupois) for each plough in the village, and selected and cut for his own use one biswa of grain at each of the three harvests from each cultivator's holding. The Ah\u00edr who had charge of the common herd, the chaukidar, who guarded the village site, and the carpenter, each got his 15 panser\u00eds per plough and biswa at each harvest per cultivator. The gorait, who watched the crops, was allowed 13 panser\u00eds and biswas, the pandit, who performed the marriage ceremonies, six panser\u00eds and biswas, while the lowest remuneration of six panser\u00eds and no standing crop was thought enough for the lessee's Kah\u00e1r servant, the potter, the washerman, the barber, and the Gur\u00fa, or half-inspired half-insane soothsayer.\n\nThe lessee provided for his expenses undertaken on behalf of the community by a rate of between 4 annas and 8 annas per plough, and the cultivator was allowed to ensure himself good luck by cutting one biswa for himself from each crop, and exempting its produce from the general division. Money transactions are even now almost unknown, and the communities still retain their ancient customs.\n\nWhere money rents are taken they are generally fixed by the plough and not by the area under cultivation. Thus a four-bullock plough will be charged from Rs. 20 to Rs. 30 per annum, and its owner take the whole of the grain of his fields except what he must pay as servants' dues. It is still more common to find half plough rates and half grain rates, in which case the cultivator pays from Rs. 10 to Rs. 15 on each four bullock plough, and besides gives the village head a quarter instead of the ordinary half of the grain heap.\n\nA number of taxes on trade\u2014such as transit dues, fines on sales, fees for the establishment of stalls at the Debi P\u00e1tan Fair, and benevolences on every conceivable occasion\u2014were levied by the r\u00e1j\u00e1s; but though the differed slightly in every pargana, these impositions were alike in character all over the district, and having described them in detail in the Utraula pargana article, I need not repeat the description here.\nTULSIPUR*\u2014Pargana TULSIPUR\u2014Tahsil UTRAULA\u2014District GONDA.\u2014The capital of the pargana of that name, founded some 200 years ago by one Tulsi D\u00e1s, Kurmi, lies about 5 miles from the edge of the forest in full view of the hills, and is about equi-distant from Utraula and Balrampur, the 15 miles of cart track being broken in the first case by the Pipra ferry, and in the second by the Sasai Gh\u00e1t, where the R\u00e9pti is crossed during the cold and hot seasons by a bridge of boats.\n\nIt has no roads, no school, and no tahsil, but a mud th\u00e1na about 200 yards to the south of the village preserves the peace of the neighbourhood; and not far from the th\u00e1na the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja of Balrampur is building a good brick house in the Hind Teutonic style of architecture.\n\nThe village itself is a long bazar running due north and south for about half a mile, which the piety of a converted prostitute has adorned with a small mosque, and the gratitude of a Hindu money-lender with an unpretentious shiw\u00e9la.\n\nNo octroi is levied, nor indeed is there more than a small retail trade in pots and pans, grain, and coarse cloths.\n\nThe population is 2,292, almost entirely Hindu.\n\nThe neighbourhood is a vast nearly treeless expanse of heavy clay soil broken up into small fields for rice cultivation, and cut by the deep hill torrents of the Siria n\u00e1la to the west and Nakti to the east. The only objects of interest (except Debi P\u00e1tan q. v.) in the neighbourhood are the remains of the large mud fort of the rajas of Tulsipur to the south, and a few black buck to the north of the village.\n\nUDHAULI\u2014Pargana PARTABGANJ\u2014Tahsil NAWABGANJ\u2014District BARA BANKI.\u2014On the main road to Fyzabad, 13 miles east of the sadr, chiefly inhabited by Kurmis.

R\u00e1ja Ugarsen, a Panw\u00e1r Chhattri, of Kanauj, is said to have peopled the village; his descendants held it till 806 Hijri, when they were overthrown in a war with Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Sharqi of Jaunpur; then Kurmis took possession, and still hold it.\n\nThe site is level; there is no forest near, but many orchards have been planted round. Two temples to Mah\u00e1deo and one Th\u00e1kurdw\u00e1ra, with a vernacular school at which 50 pupils attend, are the local institutions. There is an annual fair and two weekly markets. The remains of the ancient palace and court-house, where R\u00e1ja Ugarsen used to dispense justice, are still to be seen.\n\n* By Mr. W. C.

It takes a direction to the south by east, and after a course of 7 miles forms the boundary between the districts of Sh\u0101hjahanpur and Kheri; enters the latter district in latitude 28\u00b022' north and longitude 80\u00b028' east. It flows through that district in a south-easterly direction to its junction with the Chauka, on the left side of the latter in the Sitapur district in latitude 27\u00b042' north, longitude 81\u00b013' east. Its total length may be estimated at about 110 miles. It is liable to very great floods; its cold weather discharge is not more than 30 feet at Lakhimpur, and near Aliganj the channel is entirely dry in places, but during the rains the current is in places a third of a mile broad and ten feet deep in mid-channel. It is not used for navigation, and is of little service for irrigation, being 100 feet below the level of the adjoining country. It is bridged on the road between Aliganj and Gola.\nUNAO DISTRICT ARTICLE.\n\nABSTRACT OF CHAPTERS.\n\nI.\u2014NATURAL FEATURES. II.\u2014AGRICULTURE AND COMMERCE. III.\u2014THE PEOPLE.

The area of the district is 1,765-50 square miles, with an aggregate population of 945,955, or 588 to the square mile. It lies between 26\u00b06' and 27\u00b02' north latitude, and between 80\u00b06' and 81\u00b04' east longitude. There are 1,697* towns, villages, and hamlets in the district, containing 3,120 masonry and 210,810 mud-built houses, which gives to each dwelling an average of 4 residents. The number of adult males in the district is 305,772, and that of adult females is 306,656. Children number 332,322. This is exclusive of the Europeans and the prisoners in the jail. The Muhammadan population is 6\u00b77 per cent. to the Hindu 93\u00b73 per cent.\n\nThe district is very flat, and has no features of particular interest. It is well wooded, which gives a relief to its otherwise uninteresting appearance. It abounds in lakes, and for sometime after the rains marshes spread far and wide; these however dry up during the hot weather months.\n\nThe Sai and the Loni run through the district; the latter is dry during a portion of the year.\n\nThe soil to the west and north is light and decidedly sandy and to the east containing laterite; here and there saline terrene but not sufficiently saliferous to make salt manufacture paying as a Government monopoly.\n\nThe area under cultivation is about 52 per cent. The present district is divided into four tahsils and twenty-one parganas given in the following table:\n\n* 1,706 according to Census Report.\nStatement showing the Tehsil and Pargana arrangement also their area in acres.\n\n| Tehsil and Pargana |\n|-------------------|\n| **Name of tahsil.** | **Name of pargana.** | **Area in acres.** | **Jama including cesses.** |\n| Unao ... ... | Unao ... ... | 40,693 | 54,109 |\n| | Faridpur ... ... | 22,586 | 27,985 |\n| | Nikandarpur ... ... | 37,458 | 62,944 |\n| | Harha ... ... | 143,649 | 1,83,919 |\n| | Total ... ... | 244,886 | 3,28,957 |\n| Sapshar ... ... | Safipur ... ... | 88,937 | 1,06,858 |\n| | Fatehpur Chaurasi ... ... | 54,999 | 62,583 |\n| | Bangarman ... ... | 110,079 | 1,27,149 |\n| | Total ... ... | 249,015 | 3,98,091 |\n| Mohan ... ... | Mohan ... ... | 124,686 | 1,16,943 |\n| | Ashwan ... ... | 62,104 | 84,969 |\n| | Jhalotar Ajgian ... ... | 62,432 | 91,34 |\n| | Parsandan ... ... | 28,051 | 35,503 |\n| | Total ... ... | 277,463 | 3,29,819 |\n| Purwa ... ... | Purwa ... ... | 69,830 | 85,712 |\n| | Maulanwani ... ... | 108,734 | 1,39,761 |\n| | Asoka ... ... | 27,658 | 34,453 |\n| | Magrayar ... ... | 19,485 | 20,938 |\n| | Panhan ... ... | 12,204 | 16,149 |\n| | Patan ... ... | 6,918 | 8,008 |\n| | Bhir ... ... | 14,634 | 18,924 |\n| | Bhagwantnagar ... ... | 27,807 | 33,330 |\n| | Ghatampur ... ... | 16,937 | 22,262 |\n| | Daundia Khera ... ... | 39,508 | 51,552 |\n| | Total ... ... | 343,780 | 4,22,504 |\n| **GRAND TOTAL** ... ... | **1,114,644** | **13,79,361** |\n\nFormerly it only contained twelve parganas, but in 1869 one pargana, Mohan Aur\u00e1s, was taken from Lucknow and added to Nawabganj tehsil, the headquarters being at the same time removed and tehsil Mohan constituted. Seven parganas were taken from Rae Bareli and added to\ntahsil Purwa. The population of the district was thus augmented from 724,949 to 945,750,* the area from 1,349 square miles to 1,7645\n\nThe land which has been added to the district is certainly superior to what formerly belonged to it in fertility. It forms in fact a large portion of the ancient province of Baisw\u0101ra, including the earliest seats of the Bais clan. Still the general features of the district have not been much changed, and at any rate what is extracted from the settlement report is still true as regards the whole of the ancient district and two-thirds of the modern one.\n\nGeneral aspect.\u2014Except where the country falls as it approaches the Ganges a uniform dead level prevails; rich and fertile tracts, studded with groves, alternate with waste and plains of \u00fasar, the whole intersected here and there by small streams as the Sai, Loni, &c. Natural objects of interest or beauty are entirely wanting.\n\nFertility.\u2014Though well cultivated, I do not think the district is at all distinguished for fertility. Of the total area 54 per cent. is actually under cultivation, 20 per cent. is recorded fit for cultivation, and 26 per cent. as unculturable. This is a large percentage of irreclaimable land, but I do not think the estimate is in excess of the real fact.\n\nProduction of cultivated land.\u2014As regards the productiveness of the land under cultivation there can be no doubt, the estimated yield per acre being shown below; that from the first class land being almost equal to what is obtained in England:\n\n| Land. | Irrigated. | Unirrigated. |\n|-------|------------|-------------|\n| 1st class | Bushels 21 | Bushels 11 |\n| 2nd ditto | ditto 18 | ditto 9 |\n| 3rd ditto | ditto 9 | ditto 7 |\n\nRich tracts, their situation.\u2014The richest tracts, where the best and most valuable crops are produced, lie chiefly in the centre of the district in parganas Purwa, Harha, Unao, Jhalotar, and Aswan. The prevailing soils are good, loom and clay; and water for irrigating purposes is for the most part abundant and certain, being obtainable at all seasons from considerable tanks and wells which are readily dug everywhere.\n\nPoor tracts, and where to be found.\u2014The inferior and poor tracts are found in the outer parganas of Safipur, B\u00e1ngarmau, Asoba, &c., running generally in a narrow belt varying from one to six miles in width, round the district, where the chief soil is inferior loam or sand.\n\nMarshes and tanks.\u2014Though there are no pieces of water sufficiently large to be dignified by the name of lakes, there are in several parganas numerous sheets of water which deserve notice. The chief are found in parganas Jhalotar, Ajgain, Parsandan, Unao, and the northern parts of Harha and Maur\u00e1nw\u00e1n. They hold water all the year round, and afford ample and certain facilities for irrigation to the villages bordering upon them. In the Samundar T\u00e1l at Jhalotar and the Jalesar, and Bas-aha T\u00e1l\n\n*Not including prisoners and Europeans.\nin Parsandan and Harha, fish abound and the water-nut is extensively grown. From both these items the landowners derive a considerable revenue; the former being purchased by speculators from Cawnpore and Lucknow, and the latter finding a ready sale in the adjacent towns and villages.\n\n**Rivers.\u2014**The only river in the district is the Ganges, which forms the southern boundary. It is not however put to much use, either as a highway for conveyance of produce to Cawnpore or for irrigation. The people have a strong prejudice against using the water from the main stream for the latter purpose, though occasionally they will irrigate from the smaller channels or \"sotas,\" which in some parganas run for a considerable distance inland.\n\n---\n\n**CAWNPORE GANGES BRIDGE WORKS.**\n\n*Water Level taken every day at 7 A.M., for the month of September, 1874.*\n\n| Date | Water level |\n|------|-------------|\n| Sep., 1st | 362-90 |\n| \" 2nd | 369-60 |\n| \" 3rd | 369-40 |\n| \" 4th | 369-90 |\n| \" 5th | 370-10 |\n| \" 6th | 370-40 |\n| \" 7th | 370-45 |\n| \" 8th | 370-70 |\n| \" 9th | 371-00 |\n| \" 10th | 371-00 |\n| \" 11th | 371-35 |\n| \" 12th | 373-10 |\n| \" 13th | 372-20 |\n| \" 14th | 373-45 |\n| \" 15th | 373-92 |\n\n| Date | Water level |\n|------|-------------|\n| Sep., 16th | 372-92 |\n| \" 17th | 372-88 |\n| \" 18th | 372-92 |\n| \" 19th | 372-00 |\n| \" 20th | 371-85 |\n| \" 21st | 370-00 |\n| \" 22nd | 369-35 |\n| \" 23rd | 369-00 |\n| \" 24th | 368-65 |\n| \" 25th | 368-20 |\n| \" 26th | 368-20 |\n| \" 27th | 368-20 |\n| \" 28th | 367-70 |\n| \" 29th | 367-50 |\n| \" 30th | 367-30 |\n\nHighest flood-level, of which we have any record before 1874, was 372-28, and varied from this to 369-00. Last year's highest flood was 370-50, whilst that of 1874 was 372-92, the highest on record.\n\n**Streams.\u2014**There are, however, several minor streams, either bordering on or passing through the district, and the water they all hold the greater part of the year is extensively used for purposes of irrigation, the flow being regulated and equalized by numerous earthen dams which are erected at fixed places. The rules under which these dams are maintained and regulated have been carefully recorded in the administration papers of the several villages interested. Water in a dry season becomes so valuable that unless rules are distinctly laid down and agreed to by all, these dams would be a never-ending source of dispute and quarrel.\n\n**Minor streams detailed.\u2014**The chief of these streams are as follows:\n\n(1.) The Sai which, rising in the Hardoi district, enters Unao at Sultanpur, pargana Bungarmau, and after skirting the entire northern boundary, leaves the district at Rampur passing into Rae Bareli. Though holding\nwater all the year round, it is readily fordable everywhere shortly after the rains have ceased, and there are bridges at all the main roads. The best specimens of native bridge architecture I have seen are to be found across this stream. The bridges at Mohan and Bani are well worthy of notice and preservation.\n\n(2.) The Kalyani, which also rises in Hardoi, enters the district at Lahramau, and passing through parganas Fatehpur and Bangarman falls into the Ganges at Maraunda. It is readily fordable at all seasons.\n\n(3.) Of much the same size as the Kalyani is the Tinai which, rising in the Kutkari jhil at Aswan, passes down through parganas Aswan and Pariar. Though holding water all the year round, it is not so much used for purposes of irrigation as the other two; the banks are high and steep, and the cost of raising the water to the fields absorbs the profit derived from the irrigation.\n\n(4.) The Loni is a small stream which, rising in the Pawai tank in the Unao pargana, flows in a south-easterly direction, passing out into the Rae Bareli district. It does not hold water any length of time, and is chiefly noted for the beautiful crops of rice grown in its bed and on its banks in the autumn. In October it may be traced for miles by the brilliant green which marks its course.\n\nCanals.\u2014The only canal is that of king Nasir-ud-din Haidar, which entering the district at Sultanpur traverses the north-western portion of pargana Bangarman and a small corner of Safipur, joining the river Sai at Kursat. The original idea was to join the Ganges and Gumti, but the levels were so infamously taken, and the money granted so misappropriated, that after spending lacs of treasure, and injuring, more or less, every village through which the canal was driven, the king found himself as far off as ever from the object he desired. It has never done aught but harm. Its bed shelters wild beasts and bad characters in the dry weather, and drains off all the water from the adjacent villages in the rains, thus not merely depriving the land of the water which would otherwise fertilize it, but causing a continual cutting and ravining away of all the neighbouring fields.\n\nTemperature.\u2014The range of the thermometer is much the same as in other plains stations. In the hot weather it varies in ordinary years from 75\u00b0 to 103\u00b0, and in the cold season from 46\u00b0 to 79\u00b0. I note below the range for the last year:\n\n| Month | Approximate mean temperature | Range of thermometer |\n|-------|-----------------------------|----------------------|\n| January | 60                          | 27                   |\n| February | 68                          | 32                   |\n| March   | 77                          | 24                   |\n| April   | 81                          | 25                   |\n| May     | 89                          | 28                   |\n| June    | 92                          | 28                   |\n| July    | 84                          | 15                   |\n| August  | 84                          | 11                   |\n| September | 86                        | 9                    |\n| October | 79                          | 19                   |\n| November | 70                         | 37                   |\n| December | 61                         | 20                   |\nThe following statement shows the rainfall for eleven years ending with 1875. It gives an average yearly fall of 37-4 inches:\n\n| Years | Inches |\n|-------|--------|\n| 1865  | 26-0   |\n| 1866  | 27-0   |\n| 1867  | 75-7   |\n| 1868  | 15-2   |\n| 1869  | 41-2   |\n| 1870  | 63-3   |\n| 1871  | 42-0   |\n| 1872  | 36-5   |\n| 1873  | 27-1   |\n| 1874  | 32-0   |\n| 1875  | 26-0   |\n\nAverage for eleven years ... ... 37-4\n\nThe accompanying table exhibits the rainfall for the last two years of drought, 1868 and 1873, each of which was followed in 1869 and 1874 respectively by considerable scarcity.\n\nIt will be noted that the entire rainfall was scanty in 1868, the distribution was capricious and unusual, and there was no rain during individual months in which it is much needed for agricultural purposes in both years.\n\nThere are four rainfalls, each of which must be propitious to secure a good harvest. First, the June rains, the former rains as they may be called; in 1873 and 1868 there was only about an inch, not enough to moisten the earth for the plough and to water the early rice. Second, the main monsoon which commences in July and ends at the commencement of October; this was insufficient in the year 1868, and the fall in September, in both years, was only six inches, and it ceased too soon, viz., on September 16th and 21st. Third, the latter or October rains, which are required to water the late rice and moisten the land for the winter ploughings, were wholly deficient in both years. Fourth, the January-February rains, which were wholly wanting in 1869 and in 1874, were less than a quarter of an inch.\n\nSpeaking broadly then, the rains commenced poorly in 1868, badly in 1873, they ended with six inches in 1868, but too soon; in 1873 they were sufficient for the last month, and ended still earlier in September.\n\nSo far 1873 was much worse than 1868; then there was absolutely no rain in either year from October till January, but in February there was no rain in 1869, and in 1874 none of any value.\n\n|                | 1868 | 1874 |\n|----------------|------|------|\n| Rainfall from June 1st to October 1st | 12-7 | 26-1 |\n| From October 1st to December 31st | 0-1 | 0-0 |\n| In June | 1-1 | 0-8 |\n| In September | 6-6 | 6-5 |\n| In October | 0-1 | 0-0 |\n| Date of rain commencing | June 16th | June 20th |\n| Date of rain ending | September 21st | September 16th |\n| Rain in January and February of ensuing year | 0-0 | 0-9 |\nMedical aspects.\u2014The medical aspects are described as follows by the Civil Surgeon, Dr. Selous. No statistics as to the annual birth-rate in this district exist.\n\nReturns of deaths were made up, but I do not think them trustworthy, inasmuch as they represent the death-rate for 1873 to have been 166 per mille\u2014a number which must be too small, being less than that for the United Kingdom.\n\nDeathrate.\u2014The following table shows the deaths from all causes for 1872 and 1873. Prior to 1872 the method of collecting was more imperfect than it is at present. I have not therefore thought it worthwhile to give the statistics of former years:\n\n| Cause | C. | M. | H. | O.C. | Cholera | Small Pox | Fever | Bowel Complaints | Accidents | Suicide | Wounds | Total |\n|-------|----|----|----|------|--------|----------|-------|-----------------|-----------|--------|-------|-------|\n| 1872  |    |    |    |      |        |          |       |                 |           |        |       |       |\n| 1873  |    |    |    |      |        |          |       |                 |           |        |       |       |\n\nThe mode of collection is as follows:\u2014The village watchman reports each death as it occurs at the police station, where the officer in charge enters it in his diary, which at stated intervals is sent to the office of the District Superintendent of Police at the headquarters' station where the returns are compiled. There is no check upon the chaukidars who may frequently omit to report a death.\n\nThe prevailing endemic disease of this district is malarious fever, intermittent, remittent, and continued with its sequelae, enlarged spleen, dropsy, &c. Dysentery, another disease of malarious origin, is also endemic, and prevails in the same places and during the same months as ague. Besides these leprosy is met with to a limited extent\u2014not in my opinion greater than in this province generally. The special causes to which these diseases are to be attributed are those which are productive of malaria, viz., the neighbourhood of marshy land and defective drainage. Rice cultivation is probably here as in Italy a cause of malaria, a rice field being an artificial swamp.\n\nI do not think it likely that any improvement is taking place, although it is impossible (owing to the untrustworthiness of our mortuary statistics) to bring this to proof.\n\nNo swamps have been drained at any rate within recent times, cultivation has increased, but not in such a way as to have any beneficial effect on the public health, inasmuch as it has been at the expense of pasture\nlands, not of marsh or forest, no forests have been cut down, there being none in the district, and sanitary efforts have been mainly directed to the removal of conditions favouring the development of such diseases as cholera or typhoid fever, not those producing marsh miasma. Something in the way of drainage has been effected near the station of Unao, but I am not able to say with what result.\n\n**Epidemics.\u2014**The epidemics, which usually are cholera and small-pox, visit the district yearly, but in addition dengue visited the town of Unao in 1872, but did not, as far as I can discover, pervade the district. Cholera generally commences in April or May, reaches its height about August, then declines and disappears at the end of the year. Its specific characters are purging and vomiting of a matter resembling rice water, followed by collapse in which the patient may die, and afterwards should he survive by a febrile state.\n\nWith regard to the cause nothing is known with certainty, some attributing its spread to contagion by means of the evacuation, others to atmospheric conditions, together with a peculiar state of the constitution rendering it liable to the disease. These different views are to be found in all standard works on medicine; there is nothing special in the disease as it presents itself in this district.\n\nAll classes of natives are liable to attacks of cholera, the poor perhaps to a greater extent than the more well-to-do, though this is doubtful. The rate of mortality among those attacked in 1873 was 53\u00b707.\n\nSmall-pox prevails during the whole year, spreading throughout the district and returning on its traces by the time a fresh crop of subjects has grown up. The largest number of deaths occur in July, August, and September. Specific characters of small-pox are well-known and to be found in every work on medicine; there is nothing unusual in the disease as it is met with in this district.\n\nThe cause is contagion or infection. The disease attacks all indiscriminately, rich and poor, Hindu and Muhammadans.\n\nNo statistics exist showing the rate of mortality among those attacked.\n\n**Cattle plague.\u2014**The only cattle epidemic about which I can obtain any information occurred in 1873, and affected a few villages only. Mr. Ireland, Inspector of Police, was sent to make inquiries, and describes the symptoms as follows:\n\nOn some part of the animal's body, generally the neck, a swelling formed which bursting left a sore, the skin around to a considerable distance being discoloured. At the same time diarrhoea set in, the bullock refused to eat, became extremely weak and died, or the symptoms abating slowly recovered. This description does not give a sufficiently clear notion of the disease as to enable me to offer any opinion as to its nature. In the opinion of the Deputy Commissioner cattle have suffered from the breaking up of pasture land, which is taking place to a considerable extent throughout the district.\nFairs.\u2014The principal fairs and religious gatherings are the following:\n\n1st.\u2014Pariar Fair. This is held at Pariar on the Ganges in the Unao tahsil, opposite Bithur, in the North-Western Provinces, at which town a similar gathering takes place at the same time, the full moon of Kartik (October or November). It lasts 10 to 15 days, and is attended by about 200,000 people. It is the most important commercial fair, but the chief traffic is at Bithur, whither a number of people from the Oudh side repair to make their purchases, though a good deal of business is done at Pariar chiefly in the cheaper articles of commerce. The staple articles of trade are cloth, blankets, silk and Amritsar goods, toys, &c. Besides being a commercial it is also a religious gathering, the principal ceremony being bathing in the Ganges, which is the object of adoration. No epidemic has of late years broken out among the pilgrims at this fair. It occurs at a season when cholera is not common, and sanitary arrangements are carefully carried out.\n\n2nd.\u2014Kolhwagara Fair, held at the village of that name on the Ganges, in the Unao tahsil, at the same time as that at Pariar. It lasts 7 to 10 days, and is attended by about 200,000 people. It is of the same character as the Pariar Fair; the staple articles of commerce are similar but adapted to the wants of a poorer class of frequenters; the ceremonies and object of adoration are also the same. No epidemic has visited this fair probably owing to the causes given above.\n\n3rd.\u2014Takia Muhabbat Shah, held at Patan in the Purwa tahsil in March and December. It lasts 10 to 15 days, and is attended by about 150,000 people. It is partly commercial and partly religious in character, the staple articles of trade being silk, blankets, cloths, toys, &c., and the object of adoration the shrine of Faqir Muhabbat Shah. No epidemic has as yet broken out here.\n\n4th.\u2014Kusahri fair, held at the village of Kusumbhi, in the Mohan tahsil, on the day of the full moon of Beisakh, lasts 7 or 8 days, and is attended by 40,000 people. It is chiefly of a religious character, though some business is done in cloths and other articles of consumption of the poorer classes. Debi is the deity worshipped there. The worshippers ask some boon of the goddess, and in the event of its being granted sacrifice a goat at the next yearly gathering. No epidemic has broken out here.\n\nAbout fever the Civil Surgeon reports as follows:\u2014I had the opportunity of looking at the country, generally of examining the villages which lay near my route, and of questioning all persons I could find who had lost relatives from fever during the past two years, in order to ascertain whether the disease had been really fever or not. The inducement to this last proceeding was furnished by the mortuary returns which, as remarked by the Sanitary Commissioner, show that registration is still in an imperfect state. It appeared to me that errors would be found in the returns of the diseases to which deaths were due as well as in those of the total mortality and the proportions of the sexes.\nI found the greatest difficulty in collecting evidence of this sort, the people seemed to imagine that some danger lurked under the interrogation to which they were subjected, and it sometimes happened that in a village of from two to three thousand inhabitants, I could not discover five persons who acknowledged having lost a relation during the past year. In the village of Atardhani, containing 250 houses for instance, which I visited with the Deputy Commissioner, although Mr. Dyson and myself used our utmost efforts at persuasion, only three men came forward to give evidence. In all the villages I visited I found, more or less developed, the causes which are well known to give rise to malarious emanations, the neighbourhood of low-lying, ill-drained lands, swamps, jhils, rice fields, and excavations, particularly in the Safipur and Bangarmau thanas, which supply the largest numbers of reported deaths. This part of the district skirts the Ganges and is low, intersected by ravines and jhils, connected during the rains with the river, and liable to floods. The villages themselves were generally speaking dirty and full of filthy pits and refuse heaps. I took down statements of 54 cases of fever from the lips of the relations of the deceased, taking care only to record the accounts of persons who, when asked what their relations died of, answered fever. The number is small considering how many villages I visited, but as I have said above, I experienced the greatest difficulty in getting men to come forward. Of these cases thirty seemed to me undoubtedly malarious fever, 14 not fever at all, and in the remainder I could not make up my mind as to whether the disease had been fever or no.\n\nIt appears then that of 54 deaths reported as having been caused by fever, 14 or 25.9 per cent. were not due to this disease at all, and that some doubt hangs over about 20 per cent. of the remainder. The number of cases examined was too small to enable one to generalize with safety, but when it is considered that they were collected from many villages scattered over a considerable area, I think they may be taken as affording an approximate notion of the ratio of genuine to spurious cases reported. I was also informed by several lambardars, patwaris, police officers, and chaukidars that when the relatives do not know what a man died of they return it as fever.\n\nThe conclusion I have come to is, that undoubtedly fever does cause a large proportion of the mortality, but not by any means to the extent which the mortuary returns indicate. Supposing that of every fifty-four cases reported fourteen were spurious, the mortality in 1873 from fever would be reduced from 8,930 or 52.4 per cent. to 6,624 or 43.0 per cent. The mortality in 1872 would in like manner be reduced of 10,386 or 70.07 per cent. to 7,697 or 52.4 per cent.\n\nIt is quite possible that owing to the small number of cases on which these calculations are based, the proportion of spurious cases is not so great as is shown here, but I think one can with safety assume that 20 per cent. of deaths returned under the heading \"fever\" are really due to some other disease. Even after making these deductions, the number of deaths from malarious fever is very large, but not sufficiently so as to place Una under the category of fever-stricken districts.\nCHAPTER II.\n\nAGRICULTURE AND COMMERCE.\n\nAgricultural statistics\u2014Crops\u2014Indigo and cotton\u2014Irrigation\u2014Wells\u2014Rents\u2014Prices\u2014Famines\u2014Food of the people\u2014Fisheries\u2014Markets\u2014Commerce\u2014Exports\u2014Manufactures\u2014Railway traffic\u2014Roads\u2014Cart-tracks\u2014Ferries.\n\nSoils.\u2014There are in this district three kinds of soil, known to the people as dumat (loam) mati\u00e1r (clay) and bh\u00far (sand). No doubt these might be easily subdivided into a considerable number of classes according to situation in the village and quality of soil; but it is as unnecessary as it would be tedious to descend into minute details.\n\nThe percentage each description bears to total area is as follows:\n\n| Description | Percentage |\n|-------------|------------|\n| Dumat       | 59 per cent |\n| Mati\u00e1r      | 18 \"        |\n| Bh\u00far        | 23 \"        |\n| Total       | 100        |\n\nThe barren waste is particularly bad, nowhere have I seen \u00fasar plains of such extent and apparent unfruitfulness as in this district. They extend through the central parganas, forming in their waste and desolate aspect a marked contrast to the rich tracts with which they are mingled. Nothing will grow upon them, except here and there a weird-looking bab\u00fal tree (Acacia arabica). During the rainy months, it is true, the village cattle pick up a scanty pasture, but even this fails; shortly after the rain ceases to fall the grass withering away.\n\nAmount of land which can be well cultivated by one plough.\u2014It is calculated that from eight to ten bighas of stiff soil, and from ten to fourteen of light, can be well and fully worked by one plough and a pair of bullocks. Taking the whole district through, there is an average of 9\u00b76 bighas, or six acres of cultivated land per plough. Cultivation would appear, therefore, to be somewhat under what might be expected.\n\nThe ordinary crops of the district kharff, henwat, and rabi are the same as are detailed at length in the account of the Partabgarh district.\n\nExceptional crops.\u2014Sugarcane and s\u00e1nw\u00e1n are quite exceptional crops, and belong to neither of the three main divisions. The thin kind of sugarcane, known among the people as \u201cbaraunkha,\u201d is that which is generally grown in the district, the people being under the impression that it yields a better description and more abundant supply of saccharine matter than the thicker and apparently finer description of cane as \u201cbarangha\u201d and \u201cmatra;\u201d my own impression, however, is that the secret lies in their rude mill, usually nothing more than the sharpened end of a small tree, working with a rotary motion inside a partially hollowed log, being unable to express the juice from the finer kind of cane, while the inferior description yields readily to the pressure brought to bear upon it. Cutting usually commences early in January, but is not completed and the sugar made until the middle of February. The crop lies midway between the henwat and the rabi, but cannot be classed with either. In\nthe same way the s\u00e1nw\u00e1n is not sown until the middle of May, and is only cut just before the rains commence.\n\nDependence of cultivators on their Mah\u00e1jans for seed.\u2014For seed the majority of the cultivators are still dependent upon the mah\u00e1jans, who usually take back the value in kind. As it is borrowed when grain is dearest and repaid when it is at its cheapest, the lenders usually contrive to get an exorbitant percentage out of the cultivator. It is a ruinous system, but no stop can be put to it until landowners become sufficiently unfettered to store up seed for themselves.\n\nQuality of produce.\u2014There is nothing grown in the district particularly deserving of notice: the crops are all of an ordinary description.\n\nSoil not adopted for cotton.\u2014Cotton does not appear to succeed well. During the American war when prices ranged high a good deal was grown, but as prices fell off its cultivation declined, and I do not think it will ever become a favourite staple.\n\nIndigo extensively grown.\u2014Indigo was formerly extensively grown in the parganas of Harha, B\u00e1ngarmau, and part of Safipur. There were two large manufactories in the Nawabi; one near the Ganges in the Harha pargana and the other at Mi\u00e1nganj, established by Mi\u00e1n Alm\u00e1s Ali Khan; both went to ruin in the latter days of the Nawabi, and the people ceased growing the plant. But since the recent establishment of a manufactory at Muradabad, the people in the B\u00e1ngarmau pargana, where the soil is suitable for it, have again taken to its cultivation.\n\nRotation of crop.\u2014In rotation of crop I find the rule to be one exhausting crop as wheat, followed by two or three light ones. For instance a field of ordinary soil is this year sown with wheat, next year it bears a light khar\u00edf crop as k\u00e1kun or mindwa, followed by a light rabi as barley or peas, the year following by a henwat crop as ju\u00e1r, the third year with wheat again. Of course where manure is abundant the valuable crop would come round more rapidly, but the usual rotation is as above. When only one crop is obtained from the land each year an exhausting crop is always grown, but when two, care is taken to sow a light one at both seasons.\n\nCultivators' holdings are small, the average being as follows:\n\n| Resident cultivators | Non-resident ditto |\n|---------------------|--------------------|\n| A.                  | P.                 |\n| ...                 | ...                |\n| ...                 | ...                |\n| 4                   | 1                  |\n| 5                   |                    |\n\nIrrigation.\u2014The chief sources of irrigation are wells, masonry and earthen, tanks and streams, the amount of land irrigated from either By wells 105,802 acres, from tanks source being about equal as shown in the marginal acres, note. There is thus irrigated from all sources a total 106,384 acres. of 210,656 acres, or 46 per cent. of the total cultivated area.\n\nWells: facility with which dug.\u2014In nearly every pargana earthen wells, by which I mean those unsupported by masonry in any way, are freely dug at comparatively small cost, the average price in the upper lands being from four to six rupees, the well lasting from two to six years. In\nmany places they last much longer, while in others they fall in as soon as the rains commence. I therefore give the average of the district.\n\n**Average depth of water in wells.**\u2014The depth of water from the surface of the ground varies considerably, but the average may be set down at twenty feet, the depth of water in the well being about ten feet.\n\n**Mode of working wells.**\u2014The majority are worked by bullocks with the charsa, a leathern bag containing from 15 to 20 gallons of water. Where the water is not very far from the surface manual labour is substituted for animal power, as men work quicker, and can irrigate a larger extent of area in a given time. When labourers are employed they are usually paid in grain, but the common custom is for the cultivators to form themselves into co-operative societies, and help each other in turn to irrigate their fields, every man being bound to assist, until the fields belonging to all the cultivators in the society have been watered.\n\n**Average amount of land irrigated per diem.**\u2014The amount of land capable of being irrigated per diem from each kind of well I estimate as follows:\n\n| Masonry well worked by one pair of bullocks | 8 biswas per diem |\n| Earthen ditto | ditto | 8 ditto ditto |\n| Masonry ditto by human labour | 5 to 10 ditto ditto |\n| Earthen ditto by hand (dhenkils) | 2 to 3 ditto ditto |\n\nSheogobind, taluqdar, has made ten wells in pargana Magr\u0101y\u0101r; they cost Rs. 1,700; the depth at which the spring is met with is 32 cubits; it was formerly 42 cubits; water lies in the well at 16 cubits or twenty-four feet. About 25 bighas of spring crops can be watered in the season, but much less sugarcane. The four purs will water a bigha in a day with ordinary bullock power; the one pair of bullocks work all day, eating a mouthful of bh\u016bsa at the end of each descent of the bucket. In April-May when the sugarcane is being watered there is about a two hours' cessation owing to the extreme heat. A pair of bullocks such as is required for well work will cost Rs. 30, if of less value they are useless and really more expensive.\n\n**Rents: prevalence of money payments: no fixed rents.**\u2014As a rule rents have for many years been paid in money and not in kind. But nowhere is there a trace of any fixed rate on the soil, classified either according to quality, or to position of the land in the village. The rule has always been for each field, to pay the price commensurate with its known productive capabilities, and the demand for land in the village; but as far as I have been able to ascertain, except in very rare instances, competition has not come in to regulate the price. During the cotton mania, I discovered competition in one pargana (B\u0101ngarmau), and rents rose considerably for land adapted to that class of produce, but on the termination of the American war, and the consequent fall in prices, the speculators were ruined, and the landlords lost considerably by them; the year following, they were glad to restore the land to the old cultivators, at considerably reduced rents.\n\n**Rents generally higher under native rule.**\u2014There is no doubt that rents as a rule, are lower now, than in the Nawabi, or perhaps I should say more equal. In the estate of a powerful landowner like the\ntaluqdar of Maur\u00e1nw\u00e1n they are much lower. He was able to protect his tenantry against outside oppression, consequently his land was at a premium, and he received higher rents than the petty landowner who could do nothing to protect his dependents, and whose land was consequently at a discount. In one village belonging to this taluqdar rents on annexation went down a third. It had been a harbour in former days for those who had to leave their own homes, to escape from the bullying they experienced in the independent villages, and therefore the cultivators were willing to pay almost any rent for the land. But annexation bringing peace and security brought the value of land to a level and equalized rents.\n\nThe prices of grain stuff in Unao for the ten years ending 1870 are given in the accompanying table. They are however only roughly correct. For instance in 1867 barley was more nearly 24 sers for the rupee than 14. Prices are undoubtedly higher in Unao than in any other town of Oudh. This is due to the neighbourhood of the great mart (Cawnpore) and to the proximity of the Ganges\u2014a trade channel by which grain is conveyed to Allahabad and Patna.\n\nWe find from the table that the average price of wheat is 18 sers for the rupee, the average of the province being 22 sers, but the discrepancy is really hardly so great. Prices are rising with considerable rapidity, more so than in other districts; capital abounds in Cawnpore; there is also a great demand for labour; mills and leather manufacture flourish, so wages are high, and there is a good market for food grains:\n\n**Statement showing the details of produce and prices for the following years.**\n\n| Description of produce | Averages |\n|------------------------|----------|\n|                        | 1861    | 1862    | 1863    | 1864    | 1865    | 1866    | 1867    | 1868    | 1869    | 1870    |\n| Paddy                  | 25\u00bd     | 36\u00bd     | 34      | 28\u00bd     | 28\u00bd     | 28\u00bd     | 28      | 27      | 20      | 26\u00bd     |\n| Common rice (husked)   | 13\u00bd     | 17\u00bd     | 16\u00bd     | 17\u00bd     | 13      | 14      | 14      | 9\u00bd      | 12      | 13\u00bd     |\n| Best rice (husked)     | 10      | 13      | 13      | 9\u00bd      | 7       | 8       | 8       | 7       | 7\u00bd      | 8\u00bd      |\n| Wheat                  | 17      | 31\u00bd     | 25      | 19      | 14      | 15\u00bd     | 15      | 12\u00bd     | 13      | 16      |\n| Barley                 | 28      | 43      | 34      | 24\u00bd     | 19      | 22\u00bd     | 14      | 27      | 18      | 26      |\n| Bajra                  | 91      | 29      | 28\u00bd     | 18\u00bd     | 20      | 21\u00bd     | 18      | 14      | 17      | 19      |\n| Jufir                  | 19\u00bd     | 34\u00bd     | 36\u00bd     | 19      | 19      | 21\u00bd     | 18\u00bd     | 14\u00bd     | 17      | 19      |\n| Gram                   | 18      | 30      | 27      | 31      | 16      | 24      | 24      | 14\u00bd     | 14      | 17      |\n| Arhar (Cyrtus cajan)   | 68      | 43      | 44      | 29      | 14      | 16      | 21\u00bd     | 17      | 18      | 28\u00bd     |\n| Urd or Miah (Phaseolus max), Mothi (Phaseolus aconitifolius), Mung (Phaseolus mungo) | 13      | 26      | 26      | 15      | 12      | 20      | 15\u00bd     | 17\u00bd     | 11\u00bd     | 13\u00bd     |\n| Masur (Ervum lens)     | 14\u00bd     | 23\u00bd     | 18\u00bd     | 14      | 11\u00bd     | 15\u00bd     | 13      | 11      | 14      | 14      |\n| Aha or Matra (Pistum sativum), Ghuiyan (Arum colocasia) | 14      | 21      | 18\u00bd     | 15\u00bd     | 13      | 13      | 14      | 11\u00bd     | 11      | 11      |\n| Sarson (Sinapis dichotoma) | 18      | 16      | 15      | 18      | 19      | 18      | 18      | 14      | 11      | 16      |\n| Lahi (Sinapis nigra)   | 21      | 20      | 18      | 21      | 21      | 20      | 19      | 16      | 16      | 13      |\n| Raw sugar              | 3       | 3       | 3       | 3       | 3       | 3       | 3       | 3       | 3       | 3       |\n\n**Famines.\u2014** The famines of 1769, of 1783-85, and of 1838, all affected this district; the price of grain rose to 7 sers for the rupee. The subject is\nreferred to in detail in the article on the adjoining district, Lucknow. In 1861, 1865, 1869, and 1874, there have been high prices leading to considerable distress. Drought has been the principal agent in causing the bad harvests which led to these calamities, but floods have been in the long run equally injurious, although each was in itself a minor calamity; they were more frequent. The irrigation of Unao being largely from wells, minor droughts do not affect its harvests as the artificial supplies of water do not fail.\n\nLittle need be said here on this subject which has been already fully treated in the article on Fyzabad, whose situation upon the bank of a good navigable river is similar to that of Unao. The last real scarcity was in 1869, but in 1873 and 1874 grain has been at very high rates owing to bad harvests and the export to Bengal. Prices as in other districts are at their highest in January-February before the spring harvest is reaped, and in July-August before the autumn harvest is ripe. Barley is the cheapest grain in the latter period, kodo and bajra in the former. If the price of these cheapest grains exceed eighteen sers per rupee famine is to be apprehended. The people feed mostly upon ju\u00e1r, bajra, kodo, barley, gram, arhar, moth, peas, of which they make bread and pottage. Rice is the most satisfying but arhar and gram the most nourishing. If any of these grains rise in price above fifteen sers for the rupee, it will be abandoned for a cheaper and inferior one.\n\nFood of the people.\u2014The food consists of the cheaper grains of maize, rice, and kodo in the five months ending with March 1st, of peas, barley, gram, pulses during the rest of the year. They take two meals a day,\u2014one at noon and one in the evening. Even the poorest do so; at any rate when working they could not labour properly without them. They economize not on the number but in the quality and quantity of their meals. A fair allowance for a working man is considered to be 12 chhat\u00e1ks of rice, 1\u00bd of gram and peas, but a ser of maize, and a ser and a quarter of kodo are required. Fish are referred to as follows by Dr. Day:\n\n\"The tahsildar of Unao considers the fishing population at about 1,000, but they also follow other occupations. They consist of Kah\u00e1rs, Lodhas, and P\u00e1s\u00eds. The market is fully supplied with fish, the cost of the larger sorts being from one anna to one and a half annas a ser; of the smaller from 9 pie to one anna and a half. The first sort of mutton is two annas a ser, the second one and a half annas. About 85,000 people in this tahsil are reported fish-eaters. The fish are stated to have increased. About 10,000 maunds of very small ones are said to be taken during the rains. The smallest size of mesh of nets used is given at half an inch, and fish are trapped in the irrigated fields during the rains. The native names of the traps and nets used are\u2014pandi, chhatta, lokari, chowruhi, bisari, or ulgi, k\u00e1nta (hook), and t\u00e1pa made of reeds and rushes, kurwar, and halka. Many fish are used as manure in the rains. There are said to be 2,000 fishermen in tahsil Purwa.\"\u2014Para. 290, \"Francis Day's Fresh-water Fish and Fisheries of India and Burma.\"\n\n\"Ranjit Singh, taluqdar of Kantha, observes that cultivators and others catch fish, but are generally people of the following castes:\u2014Kah\u00e1rs, P\u00e1s\u00eds, Koris, Lodhas, &c. The market is not fully supplied. The price\nof large fish is half an anna, and of small ones a quarter of an anna a ser. About half the population are fish-consumers. The supply has remained stationary. Small fish are taken, but not to any great extent. The mesh of the smallest nets employed is half an inch. Fish are trapped in the irrigated fields during the rains. The following are the nets and traps used:\u2014Haluka, kurwar, tap, kuttra, j\u00e1l, koena, khowra, phatka or supa, garie ulurana, kagurna, lokarel s\u00e1hjurya, ghughuroah.\u201d\u2014Para. 294, \u201cFrancis Day\u2019s Fresh-water Fish and Fisheries of India and Burma.\u201d\n\nMarkets.\u2014Besides the open markets, at the different bazars in the district, there are numerous smaller ones held once or twice a week at all the chief villages in each pargana for the convenience of the neighbouring villagers, who there dispose of their surplus produce and supply themselves with their few necessaries. The only one, however, worthy of note is that held for cattle, at the large village of Th\u00e1na, about 8 miles from Unao; it is the chief cattle market in the district, and the only one to which cattle are taken from any distance.\n\nCommerce.\u2014The commerce of the district is small, and chiefly carried on by traders resident at Maur\u00e1nw\u00e1n, Purwa, Muradabad, B\u00e1ngarmau, and some of the small ganjes scattered through the district.\n\nExports.\u2014The principal exports are grain of all kinds, gur, gh\u00ed, and tobacco, a little indigo and saltpetre; the latter is almost entirely shipped to Calcutta. The other articles are, for the most part, sent across the Ganges either to Cawnpore, Bilhaur, or Fatehgarh.\n\nImports.\u2014The chief imports are European cloth, salt, iron, cotton, spices, and similar necessaries, required for the consumption of a rural population. I do not attempt to estimate the amount of these imports and exports as there are no data available, from which reliable figures could be obtained, and statistics founded on insufficient data are worse than useless for they only lead us wrong.\n\nWholesale traders, bankers.\u2014The great banking house used formerly to be that of Chandan L\u00e1l at Maur\u00e1nw\u00e1n, whose family rose to wealth and influence through money-lending. Latterly, however, they have greatly withdrawn from trade living chiefly on their estates, and only lending among their neighbours. Their place, however, has been supplied by several Cawnpore houses who have established agents at the station of Unao.\n\nManufactures\u2014indigo and salt.\u2014There are no manufactures to speak of. Formerly there were large indigo and salt works at different places in the district, but since annexation both have been closed. Saltpetre is still made for export, its manufacture being chiefly in the hands of the Lucknow house of S h Makkhan L\u00e1l.*\n\nCountry cloth and other manufactures.\u2014All the country cloth, agricultural implements, &c., made in the district are consumed by the people of the neighbourhood in which they are manufactured.\n\n* Sah Makkhan L\u00e1l has now left Lucknow and the house is broken up.\nAccording to the return of 1872 the principal exports and imports were as follows:\n\n| Exports | Imports |\n|---------|---------|\n| Quantity | Value   | Quantity | Value   |\n| Rs.      | Rs.     |\n| Sugar    | 21,394  | 2,17,451 | Cotton, cleaned | 101,272 | 20,60,950 |\n| Gur      | 251,160 | 8,66,938 | Spices         | 47,781  | 5,48,660  |\n| Tobacco, prepared | 2,220 | 28,047 | Wheat          | 42,841  | 95,747   |\n| in leaf  | 20,392  | 1,61,088 | Edible grains  | 82,137  | 1,31,981 |\n| Spices   | 35,151  | 8,17,181 | Dyes           |        |         |\n| Wheat    | 49,875  | 98,873   | Salt           | 684,839 | 31,55,984 |\n| Edible grains | 341,751 | 6,74,056 | Cattle         | 11,485  | 1,79,964 |\n| Oil seeds| 33,286  | 91,887   | Country cloth  |        | 1,90,114 |\n| Timber   |        | 2,70,672 | Ghf            |        | 1,56,354 |\n| Country cloth |        | 1,18,647 | Metals and hardware |        | 3,91,125 |\n| Hides    |        | 1,14,066 | English piece-goods |        | 26,49,354 |\n\nTotal | ... | 82,87,857 | ... | 1,00,97,644\n\nIt will be observed that the imports vastly exceed the exports in value, but this is nominal. These returns only exhibit the foreign traffic of Unao, that which leaves the province at the gh\u00e2ts and bridges on the Ganges which divides it from the North West Provinces. The greater part of the so called import only passes through the district to Lucknow and north Oudh generally. Nor do the railway returns\u2014vide table\u2014shed more light on the matter. The railway traverses the district for 26 miles; there are four stations, but one Kusumbhi is not entered in the traffic returns. The number of passengers amounted to 2,36,688 in 1873, of whom half came from the city of Cawnpore which is beyond the Ganges although the station is on the hither side. The railway goods traffic is mainly confined to grain.\n\nIn 1873 the traffic at the various stations on the railway within the boundaries of the Unao district was as follows:\n\n| Stations | Outward | Inward |\n|----------|---------|--------|\n|          | Passenger | Total amount | Merchandise | Total amount | Passenger | Total amount | Merchandise | Total amount |\n|          | No. | \u00a3 | Tons. | \u00a3 | No. | \u00a3 | Tons. | \u00a3 |\n| Kusumbhi | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |\n| Ajgain   | 19,710 | 434 | 12 | 3 | 18,408 | 381 | 25 | 3 |\n| Unao     | 45,829 | 1,136 | 178 | 49 | 47,168 | 1,130 | 73 | 32 |\n| Cawnpore | 171,149 | 10,441 | 28,697 | 11,155 | 173,961 | 10,931 | 16,499 | 10,136 |\nRoads.\u2014There are several main lines of communication traversing the district in all directions. The chief are:\n\nI.\u2014From Cawnpore to Lucknow, the distance being in this district 22 miles. It passes through the station of Unao and the late tahsil station of Nawabganj, traversing two of the most fertile parganas in the district. It is metalled throughout and is in good order. On this road General Havelock fought some of his severest actions when advancing to the relief of the Lucknow garrison in 1857.\n\nII.\u2014From Unao to Rae Bareli via the tahsil station of Purwa and considerable town of Maur\u00e1nw\u00e1n, distance 26 miles to the boundary. It is bridged and passable at all seasons.\n\nIII.\u2014From Unao to Bih\u00e1r and Dalmau in the Rae Bareli district, via Achalganj, distance 16 miles to the boundary. It is only partially bridged and not much used.\n\nIV.\u2014From Unao to Sandila via the towns of Ras\u00falabad, Mi\u00e1nganj, and Haidarabad, to the boundary distance 36 miles. When once the bridge across the Sai river is built, this road will attract much traffic from the Sitapur and Hardoi districts. At present no carts can cross the river during the rains, and consequently other roads are preferred.\n\nV.\u2014From Unao to Hardoi via the tahsil station of Safipur and the large towns of B\u00e1ngarmau and Muradabad, distance 44 miles. This road is usually in capital order, and is frequented at all seasons by carts carrying grain from the western districts to Cawnpore. It is bridged throughout.\n\nVI.\u2014From N\u00e1n\u00e1mau Gh\u00e1t on the Ganges via B\u00e1ngarmau; As\u00edwan, and Mi\u00e1nganj to Lucknow, distance in Unao district 45 miles. Formerly under the native government this was the highway to Delhi; of late years however, this route has fallen into disuse, and the road is now only employed for local traffic.\n\nMinor roads.\u2014Besides these main roads there are several others of minor importance. They are aligned and partially bridged, but the traffic upon them is small:\n\n| Route                  | Distance |\n|------------------------|----------|\n| (1.) Cawnpore to Purwa | 26 miles |\n| (2.) Ras\u00falabad to Pariar | 15 ditto |\n| (3.) Mi\u00e1nganj to Safipur | 10 ditto |\n| (4.) Purwa to Bani     | 15 ditto |\n\nThe following is an extract from the official route book:\n\nRoads.\u2014The following is a list of unmetalled roads:\n\nI.\u2014From Unao to Rae Bareli by Achalganj and Bih\u00e1r.

The stages are B\u00e1ra 7 miles and Baksar 9 miles further.\n\nVII.\u2014From Bih\u00e1r to Baksar. This road is 14 miles long. The stages are Bhagwantnagar 6 miles from Bih\u00e1r and Baksar 8 miles further. Khurai nadi is the river on this road. Number of n\u00e1las 7.\n\nVIII.\u2014From Pariar to Hasanganj.

From Bangarmau to Sandila in Hardoi district by R\u00e1m Kot, 9\u00bd miles long.\nCart tracks.\u2014Moreover in addition to these aligned roads, there are numerous cart tracks, leading everywhere across the district. These are readily traversable for certainly eight months of the year.\n\nFacility with which the district can be traversed.\u2014From experience I can speak of the facility with which the whole district can be marched over any time between October and June. Recently another road has been made running almost straight from Safipur to Pariar; two more have been sanctioned\u2014one from Kusumbhi to Pachh\u00e1n near Nawabganj, where a fair is held, another from Ajgain to Moh\u00e1n; these roads bring traffic across country to the railway.\n\nRailway.\u2014In addition to these roads the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway Company have a branch line between Cawnpore and Lucknow. The land was applied for early in 1864, and handed over to the railway authorities after payment of compensation to the zamindars by August of the same year. The engineering works were completed, and the line opened for traffic in May, 1867. Following the same line of country as the present Imperial road, the railway runs through two of the richest parganas in the district. The average price of the land taken up amounted to eight years' purchase, only here and there did it rise as high as nine years.\n\nFerries.\u2014In addition to the railway bridge at Cawnpore ferries have been established under the Cawnpore authorities at N\u00e1n\u00e1mau and Pariar Gh\u00e1t; and all along the river the resident fishermen keep small canoes, in which they will convey passengers across the river; and in many places during the hot season the river becomes fordable, but few persons ever venture upon the passage.\nCHAPTER III.\n\nTHE PEOPLE.\n\nTowns and population\u2014Manners and customs\u2014Law of inheritance prevalent in the district\u2014Tenures\u2014Tables exhibiting the detail of ownership in the district of Unao.\n\nTowns.\u2014Population being to so large an extent agricultural towns of any size are not to be expected; there are however several with a population varying from 5,000 to 7,500 inhabitants as noted in the margin.* With exception of B\u00e1ngarmau, Maur\u00e1w\u00e1n, and perhaps Purwa, for in these alone is there anything like trade, these towns are rapidly falling to decay. Their prosperity was intimately connected with the native government, their inhabitants, for the most part in the civil or military service of the king, made a comfortable livelihood, and the Government establishments brought traffic and wealth into them; now these establishments have been removed, and the residents having lost their service, and having for the most part no property to fall back upon, are sunk in the deepest poverty and wretchedness.\n\nArea and Population.\n\n| Parganas | Number of mauzas or townships. | Area in British square miles. | Population. | Number of

A few remarks from the Settlement Report about inheritance may be appended:\n\n**Musalmans: inheritance: division of property.**\u2014The custom, as to inheritance has superseded the written law, and though of course an exception may be found here and there to the customs detailed below, the great majority are guided by them but even where there is a difference the complicated division of the Kor\u0101n law has been entirely set aside.\n\n**Where there are two or more wives: general rule.**\u2014Where there are unequal families by two or more wives the whole property is usually divided according to wives (mahrian b\u0101nt), and not according to the number of the children. For instance, if a man had three wives, one of whom had two children, another one, and the third six, the property would be divided into three equal portions, according to the number of the families, and then each portion would be subdivided among the children in each family.\nWhere there are sons, daughters, and widows.\u2014Where there are sons and daughters the landed property goes to the sons, the daughters receiving nothing, and the widows only maintenance. In houses, groves, and moveable property the daughters and widows receive a share.\n\nWhere no sons, but daughters and widow.\u2014Where there are no sons, but daughters and a widow, if the father before his death gives the share the daughter can inherit, otherwise it would descend to the widow or a nephew, but if there is no widow, or any near male relative, the daughters would inherit in preference to a distant collateral of the male line.\n\nWhere no children only widow.\u2014Where there are no children, a widow inherits in preference to a male collateral, but should the zamindari be undivided the male co-sharer inherits, the widow only receiving support.\n\nWhere neither children nor widow.\u2014Where there are neither children nor widow, the nearest male collaterals inherit equally.\n\nIllegitimate children.\u2014Illegitimate sons are entitled to maintenance only, but if born and brought up in the house the father can devise them a share; and even when he does not do so, if the people are left to themselves, as often as not, a share is given to such children.\n\nHindus concubinage: and inheritance by illegitimate children.\u2014Among all classes concubinage is common, and especially among the Rajputs who prefer this connection to a regular marriage. The consequence is that a great proportion of the Rajputs are really illegitimate, but it is hardly looked upon as a reproach, and hitherto, as often as not, the children were allowed to inherit. It is this, however, which has caused the Oudh Rajputs to bear so bad a name among the trans-Ganges clans.\n\nInheritance: school of law prevalent in district over-ridden by custom.\u2014For the most part in this district the Benares school of law has been used as the foundation, on which to build the rules of practice now in force, but custom has so completely over-ridden this written law as almost to obliterate it; and in deciding cases, I should not be inclined to follow its precepts except in matters on which custom is silent, or has not declared itself clearly.\n\nIn custom much diversity of practice prevails: instances given.\u2014As regards custom, however, there is the difficulty that it permits such diversity of practice\u2014not only in regard to property of different kinds, but even families of the same tribe vary greatly in their rules of inheritance. As an illustration of this, I would mention the Dikhits of Jhalotar; in five of their Tarafs the sons inherit equally; in the sixth the eldest son gets a half share more than his brothers. Again among some of the Bais and Kayaths the same practice prevails of giving the elder brother a larger share. Among the Bais of Bisara, Sandana, and Indarna only four sons inherit at all mere support, being given to those beyond that number, whereas in all other families of the same tribe division is made equally, no matter what number there may be.\n\nIn some tribes again it is customary, where there are two or more wives, to divide first according to number of wives, the sons then dividing their mothers' portion\u2014half, one-third, or one-fourth, as the case may be\u2014among themselves equally; others, set wives aside, and share the inheritance\ndirectly among the sons, while among the low-caste tribes no distinction between legitimate or illegitimate sons is ever thought of.\n\n**New Muhammadans.\u2014**Among the avowedly new Muhammadans, who turned from Hinduism but a few generations ago, to save either their lives or estates (among whom may be noted the zamindars of Rainapur, Umra-mau, Seora of pargana Jhalotar, and of Rikam in pargana Purwa), Hindu customs are carried on to even a greater extent; daughters are rigorously excluded from all participation in their fathers' property, sons inherit according to the custom of the Hindu clan from whence they sprang, and in some instances, as in the case of the zamindars of Mukdudpur, the practice of the rite of circumcision alone distinguishes them from the surrounding heathen population; they seldom or never repeat prayers, they wear Hindu clothing, and call themselves by Hindu names; in fact, they are at heart Hindus and, as far as practicable, keep up their old manners and traditions, but in some respects they have altered for the worse.\n\nThe people are not so truthful as they were when I joined the Settlement Department; an old zamindar would seldom tell a direct lie; he might say he did not know, but he would never deliberately state that black was white; but before I left the district, I regret to say, this had greatly altered for the worse, and men who but a few years before would have scorned to lie before their \"panch\" or a \"hakim\" came into court with a lie in their mouths as readily as the veriest bazar witness. I do not attempt to give the reason for this. I merely state the fact.\n\n**Proprietary tenures generally.\u2014**The tenures are for the most part simple; by far the greater portion of the district being held by independent proprietary communities, descendants of the original colonizers, who drove out and exterminated the aborigines. Notwithstanding the anarchy which prevailed for so many years previous to annexation, they have to a great extent held their own to the last, and though often deprived of the direct engagement of their villages by outsiders, favourites of the men in power, in the end always succeeded in re-establishing themselves and recovering possession.\n\n**Chief proprietary tenures.\u2014**The chief proprietary tenures, with the percentage each bears to the total number of villages in the district, are as follows:\n\n| Tenures       | No. of villages | Percentage |\n|---------------|-----------------|------------|\n| Taluqdari     | 268\u00bd            | 33         |\n| Zamindari     | 561\u00bd            | 47         |\n| Pattidari     | 344\u00bd            | 29         |\n| Bhayyachara   | 21              | 3          |\n\n**Talugas of three descriptions.\u2014**The taluqdars of this district are few in number and unimportant; they may be divided into three classes\u20141st hereditary, 2nd purchasers at auction, 3rd recent creations of our Government for services rendered during the disturbances. The numbers of each description are as follows:\n\n| Description      | No. of taluqas | No. of villages | Percentage |\n|------------------|----------------|-----------------|------------|\n| Hereditary taluqdas | ...            | 5               | 51         | 19         |\n| Auction ditto    | ...            | 5               | 156\u00bd       | 58         |\n| Recent creations | ...            | 5               | 59\u00bd        | 23         |\nHereditary taluqdar.\u2014It will be seen that the hereditary taluqdaras are few in number and not important as regards extent of their estates; the only ones who can lay claim to be so and require mention are Daya Shankar of Parenda, head of the Dikhits, Chaudhri Gulab Singh of Sarausi, nominal head of the Pariharas, Chaudhri Dost Ali of Unao, and Chaudhri Gopal Singh of Bangarmau.\n\nIn the accompanying tables a list of the principal tenures and of the villages held under each will be found. The zamindari is not generally found among the Rajput clans. Pattidari villages are found to abound among the Chhattiri clans, the Dikhits, Chauhans, Pariharas, Raikwars. What is called the imperfect form of land division prevails. The cultivated land is almost entirely divided according to some standard fixed by the original dividers, this standard is usually a bigha, but in some villages an arbitrary standard has been fixed. In Kalha Utaura for instance the shares are divided by reference to an assumed total area of 158 bhayya-bhara bighas as they are called. That is supposed to be the unit, and each man holds a multiple or a fraction of that area. In most of the villages the homestead, the waste, the water, are held in common by all, the cultivated land is divided off among the members of the commune.\n\nStatement of Tenures, &c., in the old district.\n\n| Name of tahsil | Name of pargana | Tenures and number of villages, &c., of each kind | Numbers of proprietors and sub-proprietors |\n|----------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n|                |                 | Taluqdar. | Independent. | Proprietors. | Number of taluqdars. | Number of proprietors. | Number of sub-proprietors. | Average area of land per resident cultivator. |\n| UNAO           | Unao            | Total    | Zamindari   | Patkidari   | Bhayya-bhara | Total    | Number of taluqdars. | Number of proprietors. | Number of sub-proprietors. | Acres. |\n|                | Harha           |          |             |             |              |          |                      |                          |                                      |       |\n|                | Sikandarpur     |          |             |             |              |          |                      |                          |                                      |       |\n|                | Pariar          |          |             |             |              |          |                      |                          |                                      |       |\n|                | Total           |          |             |             |              |          |                      |                          |                                      |       |\n| PUB.

The complicated tenures, found in the eastern districts nowhere prevailing except perhaps in the old pargana of Ajgain now joined to Jhalotar. It contained 30 villages held by a family of Dikhit Th\u00e1kurs, originally springing from the same head, but now divided into separate communities; instead, however, of each village being held separately as elsewhere, almost every one in the pargana holds a share in some of the neighbouring estates. It is not that the lands of one lie intermingled with those of another, but that the shares held are all regularly defined portions of each village; in most instances the cultivated land is alone divided, the waste, water, and townships being held...\nin common by all the shareholders. According to tradition, the intention of the founder of the scheme was to bind all his descendants together, and however much they might quarrel among themselves, give them all an interest in joining against outside aggression; this they have done, and not only against outsiders but against each other; no farmer or single member of the brotherhood ever had a chance of usurping the rights of others, and to this day the villages still remain intact in possession of their ancestral owners.\n\nThe number of divided pattis in villages held in severalty is very great, the average number being 10 per village, and as the average number of sharers in each patti may be set down at 4, we have about 40 sharers per village; taking the average size of villages this would give about 13 acres of assessed land per sharer. The majority of these men have nothing to live upon but their little property; it is not therefore to be wondered at that they get into debt, considering their previous habits and general dislike to work. The great majority keep ploughmen, and no man calling himself a zamindar would permit his family to work in his fields.\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nADMINISTRATIVE ASPECTS.\n\nAdministration of the district\u2014Thanas and police\u2014Crimes and accidents\u2014Infanticide\u2014Revenue and expenditure\u2014Education\u2014Post-offices.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The administration of the district presents nothing worth of comment. It is similar to what prevails elsewhere in Oudh.

There are four revenue tahsils and nine police thanas, the names and populations or areas of their jurisdictions are given in the accompanying tables.

A. Elliott's most interesting work on Unao, his researches having been so complete as to leave me little or nothing to add.\n\nAborigines: speculation regarding them.\u2014Of the races inhabiting the country previous to the main Rajput colonization but little is really known; the traditions extant among their conquerors being the sole guide. According to these traditions Mauranwan Purwa and the northern part of Harha may be assigned to the Bhars, and the rest of the district to the low-caste tribes of Lodhs, Ahirs, Thatheras, Lonias, Dhobis, &c. They appear to have been a pastoral race, herding their cattle in the forests which then covered the country, and raising a scanty crop of grain in the cleared patches of land about their villages.\n\nThough having recognized chiefs residing in mud forts, whose sites are in many places still pointed out, there appears to have been no unity among them, otherwise they would hardly have been overrun so easily.\n\nParallel with Bhil country.\u2014I should imagine the Bhil country in Rajputana presented a very fair picture of this district in the age of which we are now treating.\n\nAppear to have been exterminated by the conquerors.\u2014As a rule a war of extermination appears to have been carried on, and in one village only, Kantha, pargana Asoba Parsandan, is there any trace of these people. There, however, an old Lodh was pointed out as the last representative of the ancient landowners.\n\nTrace of Rajput colonisation previous to authentic history.\u2014The first historical event of importance is the colonisation of the district by the Rajputs. Previous to the dawn of authentic history we find a trace of Rajput dominion. The Gautams of Argal holding in the east, the Bisesns about Unao in the south, and the Chandels of Shurajpur in the west. But the Bisen alone appear to have had actual colonies, for they alone left a distinct trace of the estate they held. The others would appear to have merely exercised a nominal authority over the aborigines. For we find the Argal Raja gave numerous villages to his son-in-law Abhai Chand, which he could not have done had they been in the occupation of his clan; and among the colonizers of the western parganas there is no tradi-\n\n* The history is chiefly taken from Mr. Macdonochie's Settlement Report.\ntion of the Chandels having opposed their occupation of the country. It is true that in Akbar's time there was a large colony of this tribe in pargana Asawan, but they have all disappeared, and from their situation, and the absence of all tradition respecting them, I believe they arrived later with the Chauhans and Dikhits.\n\nColonizers divided into two bodies.\u2014The real colonizers may be put into two classes. The 1st are those who, after their defeat by the Muhammads under the Ghoris in Upper India, fled across the Ganges into the then almost unknown country of Ajodhya, rather than remain servants in their old homes where they had hitherto ruled as masters.\n\nThe 2nd class are those who as time went on entered the service of the Delhi Emperor, and acquired tracts of country either by direct grant from the ruler or by the sword.\n\n1st class of colonizers: their advent.\u2014Of the 1st class the Chauhans, Dikhits, Raikwars, Janwars, and Gautams are the chief, and their advent may be set-down between 1200 and 1450 A.D.\n\n2nd class of colonizers and probable date of settlement.\u2014Of the 2nd class the principal are the Sengur, Gahlots, Gaurs, and Parihars; their colonization dates from 1415 to 1700 A.D. A glance at the map will show how completely the warlike Rajput overran the district, and how tenaciously he held to the lands he then acquired.\n\nAccount of the several clans.\u2014With these preliminary remarks, I will now give a short account of the principal clans.\n\nJanwars: their arrival under Suraj and Dasu.\u2014Shortly after the taking of Kanauj, the Janwars under their leaders Suraj and Dasu migrating from Ballabgarh near Delhi settled in a tract of country lying in Hardoi, and partly in pargana Bangarmau; Suraj, however, and his followers went on further, and crossing the Gogra founded the Ikuna raj, of which the Maharaja of Balrampur is now the head.\n\nDasu settles down.\u2014Dasu remained and founded 24 villages; his successors divided into four tarafs, each taking six villages, and these their descendants for the most part retain. They were ever a blood-thirsty race, and are the only clan I have met with where the cadets as possible sharers in, and rivals to, the management of the estate were systematically murdered or driven away.\n\nConquest of pargana Fatehpur.\u2014From them are descended the Janwars of pargana Fatehpur Ghaurasi, who settled in the parganas about 200 or 250 years ago, driving out the then inhabitants, which some traditions assert were Thatheras, and others Muhammadan Gaddis.\n\nClan divided into tarafs.\u2014They divided into three tarafs, viz., the Sarae, Takhtia, and Markaha; but the eldest soon asserted its superiority and finally subjugated the other two.\nRise of Samal Singh.\u2014Early in this century Samal Singh, the chief of Taraf Sar\u00e9, was in high favour with the Lucknow court; he was made at various times chakladar of his pargana, and gradually acquired at the expense of his neighbours a large estate. After his death his son, Jasa Singh, succeeding both to his estate and influence, diligently followed in his footsteps. Cruel and unscrupulous, Jasa Singh early became one of the most notorious men in the district; while ever ready to fight, he contrived to keep on good terms both with the high officials in Lucknow and the local officers of Government, and consequently was allowed to do very much as he pleased. Dividing the pargana between himself and his cousin Bhop\u00e1l Singh, he set to work to stamp out every vestige of a former right. The villagers whom he turned out received the choice of service or death if he caught them. The majority fled, and not until annexation did they venture to return to their homes.\n\nThe fall and extinction of the family.\u2014The end of his whole family, however, has been an evil one. On the breaking out of the disturbances he was the first to turn against us; he seized and sent into the N\u00e1na at Cawnpore the Fatehgarh fugitives, and his followers were prominent in opposing General Havelock's forces. At length he was wounded in the hand at Unao, and of his wound he died on the fourth day. One of his sons was hanged, the other is still a fugitive, and his cousin, Bhop\u00e1l Singh, with his whole family, died in 1861 of cholera. The whole of their estates were confiscated, and the villages either restored to their original owners or given in reward for good service. The family has thus disappeared, and their ill-gotten wealth has been scattered to the winds.\n\nOther small colonies.\u2014There are one or two other colonies of this clan in the district who trace their descent from Gonda, but none are worthy of note. In the whole district the clan hold in zamindari right 73 villages.\n\nGautams.\u2014The Gautams formerly held 15 villages in parganas B\u00e1n-garmau and Safipur; they claim to be descended from the \u00c1rgal R\u00e1ja, but have no clear tradition of their arrival and occupancy. They now hold but 9 villages having lost several.\n\n\"The Raikwars inhabit twelve villages in pargana Bangermow, and their colony is well known by the name of Shadiepoor Gouria. They claim kindred with the Raikwar Rajas of Bondee and Ramnugur in the Baraich and Derriabad districts, and assert that at the same time that those larger colonies were founded their ancestors settled down in the twelve villages they now hold. The Bondee raja's ancestor immigrated to Oudh from the hill country about Cashmere eighteen generations or 450 years ago\u2014that is about 1400 A.D., and it is more on account of this date than from any distinct details preserved in the local traditions of these and other Raikwars that the colony is included in the first class. The connection of these Raikwars with the great rajas on the banks of the Gogra had been entirely broken off, but when they began to rise in political importance they sought to renew it. About sixty years ago, Mittoo Singh and Bukht Singh, two of the leading zemindars, went to Ramnugur and claimed brotherhood with the raja. He heard their\nstory and entertained them with hospitality, and sent them out food, and among other things tooth-brushes made of wood of the n\u00edm tree. All other Rajpoots place a special value on this wood, but the Raikwars alone are forbidden to use it, and the rejection of these tooth-brushes proved to the raja that his visitors were truly of his own kin.\n\n\"Shadiepoor Gouria was a name that had an evil savour in the nostrils of the provincial authorities of Oudh. It was a cave of Adullam, which every desperate and turbulent spirit, every outlawed or impoverished man, made his resort, so that it became a proverb in the country\u2014'Great dacoits to Jussa Singh, and petty robbers to Shadiepoor Gouria.' They had numerous conflicts with the forces of Government, and though often defeated, with their villages destroyed, and their groves (more sacred than all) cut down, the rebellious spirit was never extinguished.\"\n\n\"There is another colony of Gours who inhabit twenty-eight villages (the Tappah Banthur) in pargana Harha, and who are claimed by the above race* as an offshoot from themselves. They also are Bumun Gours of the same Gotr, but give a different account of their origin. According to them Bunthur was formerly inhabited by a race of Guddies or cowherds, who lived by pasturage and paid an annual tribute of ghi to the Government. One year, whether with intent to defraud or to show their insubordination, they filled the vessels in which the tribute was sent with cowdung, and covered it over with a small quantity of ghi. The fraud was discovered at Court, and Garupdes Gour, who held a military command at Dehli was directed to raise a body of followers and extirpate the offenders. After performing this service, he received a grant of the conquered villages, and settled there with his clan. This event is generally supposed to have taken place in Akbar's reign.\n\n\"The Gours rose to a very prominent position under Kesri Singh, who from about 1820 to 1845 exercised great influence in the country. Though not the eldest branch of the house, all the clan acquiesced in his headship, and his sagacity and prudence made him very useful to the chukladars, and gave him great influence. He not only included all the twenty-eight Gour villages in his talooka, but also got possession of several neighbouring estates, and his revenue for many years was more than a lac of rupees. He died about 1845. From the time of his death the estates he had acquired beyond his natural boundary were lost to his heirs, who had neither ability nor united spirit to maintain the position he had acquired. The twenty-eight villages were again split up into several estates, the owners of which have been engaged in incessant disputes with each other.\"\u2014\"Elliott's Chronicles of Oonao, p.p. 44-45.\"\n\nThe Dikhit.\u2014This clan whose greatness has now faded resided in Dikhit\u00e1na a province of ancient Oudh, whose boundaries are uncertain. It appears to have been mainly included in the present district of Unao, to have extended from the Ganges to Nimkh\u00e1r in Sitapur and from Baisw\u00e1ra on the east to the dominions of the Janw\u00e1rs in Fatehpur. The\n\n* The Gours of Maila in B\u00e1ngarmanu pargana.\nDikhits are described as follows by Mr. Elliott, but first it may be remarked that the pargana of Jhalotar Ajgain was the nucleus of their dominions:\n\n\"Dikhits.\u2014Next in order among the colonists we may probably place the Dikhits who, though still inhabiting a compact and extensive tract of country, have now but a meagre shadow of the power they once exercised, when the name of their country Dikhtheana was as widely renowned as that of Baiswara is still.\n\n\"The traditions of the clan relate that the Dikhits are descended from the Soorajbuns rajas, who for fifty-one generations ruled over Ajoodhia. In the fifty-first generation from Jeshwara, Raja Doorgbow left Ajoodhia and migrated to Guzerat, where his descendants took the title of Doorgbunses or children of Doorg. In the twenty-fourth generation from him Kulian Sah Doorgbuns went to pay homage to Raja Vikramajeet, the great Raja of Oojein, the supreme monarch of India. From him (about 50 B.C.) he received the title of Dikhit, which his descendants bore instead of that of Doorgbuns. For many centuries they remained stationary in Guzerat, till, at the time when the Raj of Canouj was at its zenith, Balbhuddur Dikhit, the younger son of Sumurpurdhan, entered the service of the Rahtore Raja. From him he received as a gift the Sumonie pargana which lies across the Jumna in the Banda district, and he settled down in this estate with his family and his followers. But the Hindoo monarchies were already drawing to their close, and the grandson of Balbhuddur, Juswant, saw the death of the Raja of Canouj, and the destruction of the power and the family of his benefactor. Sumonie was too near Canouj not to be affected by this great dynastic revolution, and the Dikhit colony was disturbed and broken up by these disastrous events. Juswant Singh had four sons. The eldest remained in Sumonie, and his descendants possess the estate to this day. The second, Udebhan, migrated into Oudh, and colonized the district of Dikhtheana. The third, Bunwarie, went still further north, crossing the Ghagra and the Raptee, and choosing a safe retreat in the Sub-Himalayan forests founded the great Sirneyt raj of Bansie. The fourth, Khyraj, migrated to the east, and settled down in the district of Pertabgurh, and took the town of Bilkhur whence his descendants are called Bilkhureas. Udebhan is said to have established his authority from the borders of Baiswara on the east, to Sandee Palee on the west, and from the Goomty to the Ganges embracing fourteen pergunnahs under his sway. The traditions all differ in the lists of these pergunnahs which they supply, and there is no independent evidence by which the statement can be supported. On the contrary, all other Rajpoot tribes reject the story as a mere fable. The Dikhits, however, assert that Udebhan buried charcoal at Neem Sarung as the boundary mark of his dominions in that direction. Considering the tenacity with which old boundaries are remembered and claimed, this story is not likely to be a pure invention. But as the Dikhits occupied the country earlier than almost any other clan, it is highly probable that they were unable to defend this boundary against the powerful immigrants who subsequently arrived and colonised those parts. The Malihabed Puthans\nmust have settled there about 1300 A.D., and as in 1400 A.D. they were strong enough to raise a barrier against the great Raja Tilockchund, and beat back his victorious forces, it must have been still easier for them to abolish from the territory they occupied the weak remains of Dikhit supremacy.\n\n\"The country which Udeghan and his followers occupied was thinly populated by Lodhs, who offered no resistance which tradition has cared to record. He founded a village on the banks of the Sai river in uncultivated land, and called it Neotnee from the 'tin' grass which flourished there, and was cleared away preparatory to cultivation.\n\n\"With the consent of his brotherhood, Udeghan assumed the title of raja which descended in a direct line through the eldest son for six generations. Whatever be the foundation for their claim to an extensive dominion in the west, there can be no doubt that during this period the Dikhit Raja held a very high position in the country, and that this was the time when Dikhtheana became famous as a geographical expression. The list of marriages preserved by the bard proves this, containing as it does the names of the daughters of the Jangra Raja of Dhourera, the Goutum of Argul, the Bundulgottie of Gurh-Amethie, the Buchgoti of Korar, and the Bisein of Manikpore. With an Oudh Rajpoot it is always an object of ambition to marry his daughters into a family of higher rank or position than his own, whatever the attendant expenses may be. The chiefs of eastern Oudh make it their ambition to marry their daughters only into the great Cuchwaha and Chouhan clans of Mynpoorie and Etawah; that they should have chosen the raja of Dikhtheana for their son-in-law is a proof that at that time his rank and influence were as great as those of the older western rajas are now.\n\n\"Runa Singh was the last ruler to whom the ancestral inheritance descended undivided. He has six sons, and they partitioned out Dikhtheana between them. The eldest, Beernath, settled in Chumrowlie; the second, Puthemul, in Putheora; the third, Beersah, in Bholie; Sudan occupied Sunana, Gunduraj Mushkabad, and Goodut Goura. The Purenda family, who are at present the head of the tribe, descend from Puthemul, the second son, and it is his fortunes that the hard of the clan loves to chronicle.\n\n\"When Hemow, the vizier of Mahomed Shah Adily, led his forces to oppose the return of Humayun, all Hindoostan was moved to see a Hindoo once at the head of affairs, and combating a Mahomedan in the field, and a vast army flocked to his standard. This feeling gave to the campaign something of the nature of a religious war, and as a natural result the victory of Akber spread over all the country the fear of a forcible conversion to Islamism. This fear was probably the immediate cause which prevented Puthemul from obeying the summons of Akber's General, Mahomed Ameen Khan, who was appointed to the Government of the province of Oudh. Though treated with the greatest courtesy, and repeatedly called on to submit, he refused to return any answer whatever to the summons, but sent his four rances to their fathers' homes, and called a\ncouncil of his feudatories and followers to discuss the conduct of the war. The council was attended by the Gour of Bunthur, the Bisein of Unao, the Chouhan of neighbouring Chouhan, and the Chundele mercenary, leader of a quota of horse. Some counselled him to meet the enemy in the field, and others warned him to keep within the ramparts of his fort, but not one spoke of surrender. Meanwhile the Delhi force had crossed the Ganges by a bridge of boats below Kanauj, and encamped before the fort of Putheora. Then was seen the resolution which the council of war had decided on. Clad in full armour, and followed by all his captains dressed in their saffron robes, the raja issued into the plain, and drew up his forces for the battle. The Moghal yoked his guns together to withstand their impetuous charge, but twice his staunchest battalions were driven back, and twice his shameful route was imminent, till fresh reserves came up. But the unequal contest was now all but over. Bhagwant Singh, the Chouhan had already fallen, other chiefs were wounded, and the Rajputs were weary and dispirited. Then the Moghul cavalry were brought up fresh to the attack. Lalla Singh Chundele headed one desperate charge, and fell drowned (as the bard phrases it) in that sea of horsemen. The enemy swept on in one irresistible wave over Puthemul and his captains who fell each in their places, and the power of the Dikhits was for ever broken. When the Moghul army had done its work, and had passed onward towards Ajoodhia, and Dikhtheana was left without a head, the Chundele Raja of Shurajpore thought to annex it to his own dominions, and ordered a Pundit to consult the stars and fix an auspicious day for the expedition. The Dikhits heard of it, and the elder or Chumrowlie branch of the brotherhood bestirred themselves to avert the danger. When Puthemul sent his wives to their homes, one of them, the daughter of the Dhourera raja, took her young son with her. They sent for the child, and with the consent of all the brotherhood, made him raja;\u2014and then strengthened by possessing this point of union they hastened to the banks of the Ganges to oppose the invasion of the Chundeles. By mutual consent the issue was referred to single combat, and in the first onset the Dikhit champion shot his antagonist through the forehead with an arrow. Then the Chundele Raja desisted from his attempt.\n\n\"The name of the child who was thus made raja in his infancy was Nirbuhun. He lived at Unao, and did not rebuild the ruins of his father's fort. His grandson, Beersinghdeo, founded the village of Beersingpoor, and his son Kheerut Singh removed thence and built the fort of Purenda which his descendant inhabits. But fortune did not deal well with this house, and the fame of the Raja was no longer what it had been. They never recovered the position they enjoyed before Puthemul's defeat; and what estates remained to them after that were rapidly divided and subdivided among the numerous sons, who according to Hindoo law could each claim an equal portion of the inheritance and separate himself from the parent stock. Thus the power of the eldest son dwindled away, and the title of raja brought but little substance with it. They seem, too, to have had no able or energetic men in their number. Hurrie Singh, great grandson of Kheerut, rebelled against the Government, and his fort was taken and his lands harried by Sherundaz Khan.\"\nFoujdar of Baiswara, about the year 1700 A.D. This was the finishing blow to their ill fortune, for Subuns Rai, the son of Hurrie, was too poor to be able to afford the ceremony of having the tilok affixed to his forehead on his father's death. Without the performance of this ceremony, so important in a Rajpoot's eyes, it is almost impiety for any one to assume the title of raja, and far beneath the dignity of the brotherhood to sanction it. From this fact, and from their poverty, the later rajas have lost their influence among the brotherhood, as well as among neighbouring clans, and are now looked on only as the elder brother where all are equal.\n\n\"The degradation of the family culminated in the person of Chundie Bux who died ten years ago. He was an exaggerated specimen of a character which appears occasionally among the Rajpoots to ruin the worldly prospects of a family, and to disgrace the memory of a long line of ancestors. His distinguishing, indeed his sole quality, was a laziness which was so overpowering that it assumed gigantic proportions. He professed to be a devotee, but the profession was but a cover for his desire to sit still. Neither intellectual pursuits nor manly exercises could tempt him. In his youth he was never seen on horseback, in later years never outside his house. He was too lethargic even to be stirred by hunger, and it is related on one occasion that he was forgotten by his servants, and remained for two whole days without food, too torpid to get up and fetch it. Now, if there was one thing on which the officials of the Oudh government insisted more than any other, it was that while they were engaged in their yearly revenue settlement as they traversed the country, every landholder in whose neighbourhood they were should present himself and remain in attendance on them while they were in that part of the country. Hence it became the established formula for a man who wished to show disrespect, or to assert independence to signify it by remaining in his house or fort when the chukladar approached. Chundie Bux, who would not get up to save himself from hunger, could not be expected to attend a chukladar's levee, and the natural result of this lethargy would be that the chukladar would attack him and confiscate his estate. The brotherhood therefore assembled, and unanimously deposed Chundie Bux, and elected Dya Shunkur, his first cousin, in his place. The title of raja thus for the second time fell to the younger branch as it had done in the case of Puthemul.\n\n\"Raja Dya Shunkur has shown himself superior in ability to most of his ancestors, and has done much to restore the prestige of his house, so that, though not beloved, and though considered close and grasping, he is influential and respected. He has shown himself to be brave when fighting was the wisest policy, and prudent and sagacious when he judged\n\n---\n\n*The tilok is a streak of paint marked on the forehead. The ceremony in one point answers to that of coronation in that it has a religious value, and till the proper authority has affixed it, no one can truly be called raja; it is a social ceremony, as all the brotherhood and the leading rajas and chiefs of the neighbourhood are summoned, and their presence is supposed to attest the fact of the new raja's legitimacy and right to the succession. As all these guests have to be entertained, and presents have to be made to them besides the ordinary gifts to Brahmins which are an essential part of every festival, the ceremony is very expensive.\"\nit better to temporise. He not only increased his estate by redeeming several villages from mortgage, but also got them assessed at a very low rate, and represented his poverty and difficulties with so much pertinacity and success that a large sum was remitted annually from his payment on account of armed men whom he was supposed to entertain in order to keep the neighbourhood quiet.\n\n\"He has had four great fights with chukladars. In 1248 F.S., Reo-teeram, chukladar, besieged him in his fort for several days, but at last they came to a compromise. In 1251 F.S. Ahmed Ali attacked him, and the raja escaped from the fort at night. In 1255 F.S., Bux Ali, Chukladar (the Dome who married Mrs. Walters), swore to him on the Koran that he would not hurt him, but when he came in put him in prison. The raja escaped after four days to his fort, and was attacked by the chukladar, but beat him off, took two guns from him, and killed his teh-sildar. Bux Ali retreated and got assistance from Lucknow, when the Raja evacuated the fort. In 1261 F.S., Heera Lal Misr, Nazim of Baiswara, had a quarrel with Rao Ram Bux of Doondea Khera. The Rao fled across the Ganges (this family were notorious for running away), and his Naib, Tukut Singh, took refuge in a village close to Purenda, in the house of a Dikhit, into whose family he had married. The nazim pursued him, when Raja Dya Shunkur took him under his protection, sent an escort with him, and kept the Nazim at bay till Tukut Singh had safely escaped. In the rebellion Dya Shunkur remained loyal to Government. His second cousin, Jeet Buhadoor, had always been at feud with him and claimed a share of the estate, and as he joined the rebels heart and soul, that was sufficient reason for Dya Shunkur's taking the other side. When Feroze Shah, Munsub Ali, and Jeet Buhadoor, were encamped at Russoolabad, Dya Shunkur gave great assistance to the Civil Officers at Bunnee and Nawabgung by keeping them constantly informed of the movements of the rebels.\n\n\"The list of marriages from the time of Puthemul clearly shows the decadence of the house. The rajas have formed connections only with the clans which inhabit the neighbourhood of Diktheana, such as the Sengur, Sukurwal, Raikwar, Junwar, &c. As to daughters infanticide has been the rule, and not a single daughter has ever been allowed to live.\"\u2014pp. 34-42, \"Chronicles of Oonao,\"\n\nNo villages lost to the clan.\u2014Of the villages divided among the sons of Ran Singh, Dikhit, none have been lost. At present 95 villages are held by the clan.\n\nChauhans: their chief colony.\u2014Next in importance to the Dikhit come the Chauhans, who also follow closely in order of colonization. Their chief colony, which is known as the Chauhara, lies at the junction of the Unao, Asiwan, Safipur, and Pariar parganas; the tract is said traditionally to have contained 92 villages, but many of these have been absorbed in others, and now there are in this il\u00e2qa but 67 demarcated villages. Some tribes whose origin is remarkable may be mentioned.\n\nMahrors: their origin.\u2014The first of these are the Mahrors, who hold five tappas in pargana Harha; they assert that their ancestor, Shiu Raj\nSingh, came to this part of the country in consequence of his relationship with the great Bais Raja, Tilok Chand, and settling in Beorajmau gradually colonized the adjacent country. On the other hand, the tradition current in the district is that when Tilok Chand was defeated by the Malihabad Pathans his followers fled, leaving him to his fate. The bearers of his litter, however, beat off his pursuers and carried him from the field in safety; for their bravery he made them Rajputs on the spot, changing their names from \"Mahra\" or Kahar (palki-bearer) to that of Mahror. The change has been accepted, and they now intermarry with the smaller clans; they hold 22 villages.\n\nR\u00e1wats: their origin.\u2014The second are the R\u00e1wats, who formerly held three tappas in pargana Harha; tradition calls them illegitimate sons of Tilok Chand by an Ahir woman. They themselves assert, they are pure Bais, and explain their title (R\u00e1wat) in this way. About 250 years ago or thereabouts the aborigines (Sunars) taking advantage of festivities at Bithar rose and massacred the whole race; one woman who proved pregnant alone escaping. She was protected by an Ahir, and in gratitude called her son \"R\u00e1wat Beni Singh.\" On growing up to manhood Beni Singh entered the service of the Emperor of Delhi. There he rose to favour, and obtaining permission to recover his ancestral estate led a force against the Sunars, and taking advantage of them when they were keeping up the festival of Bhadr Kali Debi massacred the entire tribe, re-establishing himself at Bithar, which had always been the headquarters of his family. After this he acquired the property, a part of which his descendants still hold; they formerly held 31 villages, but now only 14.\n\nIt has not been considered desirable here to give any detailed account of the Hindu history of Una since it came under Musalman ascendency. During the time of Delhi dynasty it formed a part of Sarkar Lucknow. The following muhals and their proprietors are recorded in the Ain-i-Akbari:\n\n| Names of parganas. | Proprietors. |\n|--------------------|-------------|\n| Unam (Una)         | Sayyads.    |\n| Asifwari           | Bais, Chandela. |\n| Asha               | Ahirs.      |\n| Bangarmati         | Gahlots.    |\n| Pashan             | Bais        |\n| Parsandar          | Rajput, Kunbis. |\n| Patan              | Brahmins, Kunbis. |\n| Ranbirpur (Parwa)  | Bais, Brahmins. |\n| Sripur or Safipur   | Chandela.   |\n| Fatehpur Chaurasi   |             |\n| Mohan              | Bais.       |\n| Manranwari         |             |\n| Harha              |             |\n| Magrayar           |             |\n| Sitauli            | Rajputs.    |\n| Ghatsampur         | Brahmins.   |\n\nOn the whole property has not changed very much up to date. The Bais Chhattirs are still the chief proprietors in the district; their earliest settlement was in Daundia Khera formerly of Rae Barali now of this district; but their history has been given under that district because the greater part of their possessions lie there.\nMuhammadans: their division into two parties.\u2014The Muhammadans may be divided in two classes\u2014colonists and converts. The former are gathered together in a few large towns; the latter, few and far between, are found in the villages occupied by their Hindu ancestors.\n\nConverts.\u2014These latter may be dismissed with a few words. The chief are the zamindars of Rahnapur, Seora, Simra, and a few other villages of pargana Jhalotar, of Unw\u00e1r and Gulzarpur in Safipur, and Rikka of pargana Purwa. They have no history worth recording, and are Muhammadans in little more than name.\n\nColonists.\u2014The colonists are of two kinds: first those who settled after conquest, of which the Muhammadans of Safipur and Unao are the chief examples; and those who settled on lands granted them in j\u00e1g\u00edr as in B\u00e1ngarmau and As\u00edwan.\n\nThe first invasion of Oudh.\u2014The first invasion of Oudh by the Muhammadans was under Sayyad S\u00e1l\u00e1r Mass\u00e1\u00edd, nephew to Sult\u00e1n Mahm\u00fad of Ghazni, about the year 1030 A.D.; but this expedition was most disastrous to the Moslems, as hardly a man returned to tell the tale of their defeat and death. Along the route taken by this army the graves of S\u00e1l\u00e1r's followers are still pointed out in this district, but principally at B\u00e1ri th\u00e1na and As\u00edwan; in the latter place the ganj built close to these tombs still bears the name of the martyr's market.\n\nThe end of the expedition was disastrous. Mas\u00e1\u00edd himself and the remnant of his host falling by the hands of the R\u00e1j Bhars of Bahraich, where his shrine is still extant, built about 200 years later when the Musalmans under the Delhi Emperor had acquired a permanent footing in the province.\n\nThe earliest settlement by colonization at B\u00e1ngarmau.\u2014The earliest settlement in the district dates from the end of the 13th or beginning of the 14th century; tradition relates that a saint, Sayyad Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn, coming from Kanauj, where numbers of the conquering Muhammadans had settled after its fall, to settle in the city of Newal, was not permitted to do so by the r\u00e1ja of the place, Newal Singh, who turned the Sayyad out of his territories. The saint in his anger cursed him and all his people for their inhospitality, and as a punishment turned the town upside-down, destroying the inhabitants at a blow. It is a singular circumstance that all old vessels of domestic use and other articles are invariably found topsy-turvey in the ground; and it is even asserted that the foundation of houses have been found the same way; unfortunate however for the tradition, all the old wells, of which several are still pointed out, are the right way upwards. After this Sayyad Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn founded the town of B\u00e1ngarmau at a short distance from Newal. The shrine built over his grave bears date 702 Hijri, or 1302 A.D.\n\nThe next Musalman conquest is that of Safipur. In 819 Hijri a saint, Maul\u00e1na Sh\u00e1h Akram, was insulted here when travelling to Jaunpur. He complained on arrival to the king, Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Sh\u00e1h, who sent an army to avenge the insult and conquer the country. As\u00edwan was colonized from\nSafipur probably in the 16th century, but the more remarkable settlement of the Musalmans at Unao may be related at length:\n\n\"Sayyad Baha-ud-din, son of the Sayyad Al\u00e9-ud-deen, who was killed in the taking of Safeepur, was the conqueror of the Biseins of Oonao and the founder of the Mahomedan family who have large estates in that pargana. They are Zaidie Syuds from Wasia, and relate of themselves that they are descended from one Syud Abdul Furah of Wasia, whom political troubles forced to quite his country and to flee into Hindostan. From him are descended the most renowned Musulman families in Northern India, the Barhah and Belgram Syuds, and in Khyrabad, Futtehpore Huswa, and many other places branches of the same stem are found. A young son of this race, by name Baha-ud-deen, had fallen in the taking of Kanauj by Shahab-ud-deen Ghori (1193 A.D.), and it was said that he was slain by the very hand of a Bisein Raja of Oonao, who as vassal to the raja of Kanauj had come to do him military service in that battle. Other members of the Syud family had taken up their abodes in Kanauj, and it was from here that the Ala-ud-deen above alluded to had proceeded to join the Jeunpore force in assisting whom he met his death. The conquest of Safeepore having proved so easy, the spirit of further acquisition was awakened, and Baha-ud-deen set out, about 1450 A.D., at the head of a party of his relations, with view at once to avenge their old blood feud with the Biseins, and to annex a valuable estate. They went craftily about their design and represented themselves as horse dealers. Their Persian and Cabulee studs were much valued in a country which produced nothing bigger than ponies, and the raja was easily induced to buy so large a number of horses from them that he was unable to pay in ready money, and was obliged to make over to them a portion of the estate, out of the profits of which they could gradually repay themselves. This was what was wanted to enable them to get a footing in the country. They sent for their families, and along with them obtained the assistance of several more of their party, who came under the pretence of escorting the women. Their arrival was timed so as to synchronise with the celebration of a marriage in the raja's family, and before their increased numbers could spread abroad any suspicion of their intentions, they obtained the raja's permission for their wives to enter the fort in order to visit his wife and congratulate her on the happy event. In each of the covered litters, which were supposed to contain the women, an armed man was concealed, and arms were hidden about the bearers of the litters. The fort was open to all comers, and its defenders were off their guard, and most of them intoxicated, when the Syuds throwing off their disguise, fell on the unsuspecting Biseins, and slaughtered every man within the fort. Only one son of the raja's escaped the massacre. He was out hunting when it occurred, and fled to his kin at Manikpur. The raja of that place took up his quarrel, and sent a force to reinstate him, but was defeated at Raithan and again at Kwelaghara. The Syuds, however, did not win the victory without great loss on their side, and felt that they could not long afford to continue such a combat. At this time the great Bai Raja, Tilokchund, was enjoying undisputed supremacy over the whole Rajpoot community of the south of Oudh. But the defeat he had experienced at the hands of the Mulhiabad Puthans had probably taught him that...\"\nthese new invaders were dangerous to meddle with. In token of respect and submission, the Syuds sent a present to him, which after some deliberation he accepted, answering those who wished him to assist his brother Rajputs by the arguments, that the Syuds had taken Oonao in pursuance of a blood feud, which it was their duty to prosecute, and he swore not to attack them himself nor to suffer any other Rajpoot to do so. They were to keep the Oonao pargana as their own zamindari, and charcoal was buried in the village of Kwelaghara to mark the bound.\n\n\"The Dehli king on hearing of the success of the Syuds gave them a sanud for the zamindari, and made them chowdris of the pargana, on condition that they should sound the 'Azan' and have prayers five times a day; that after each prayer they should shoot off ten arrows from the masjid, and should accompany the foujdar or chief government official whenever he went to fight any rebel in Baiswara.\n\n\"Nothing is recorded of the Syuds till two or three generations after we come to another Syud Baha-ud-deen, who is distinguished by the cognomen of Oonamy. He had singularly fallen off from the purity of Muhammadan tenets; for he had a Purihar mistress whose descendants are called Mirdahas, and inhabit the Mirdaha mohulla in Oonao. An Afghan of M\u00f3w Mahomdabad had been foujdar of Baiswara, and had acquired great unpopularity by his severity in putting down rebellion. After losing his appointment he married in Shahjehanpore, and was returning home when the zamindars of pargana Bijnoor attacked and stopped him. Syud Baha-ud-deen Oonamy went to his assistance, conveyed his bride through Mohan to Lucknow from whence her road was clear, and then returning attacked and was killed by the Bijnoor zamindars. Thus the generous daring of his death compensated for the irreligion of his life, and for many years flowers used to fall upon his grave thrown by unseen hands.\n\n\"His great grandson was Syud Gudun, during whose life the celebrated saint Shuruf-ud-deen Yehia Munery came to Oonao on his travels. Some miracles which he performed are recorded by the credulous chronicler of the house. He chose out a little square plot of ground, and had mud walls built round it, with no door, to the height of ten feet. Here he performed a 'chilla' or forty days fast, sitting inside his little castle and holding no communication with the world outside. At the end of the time he gave a signal that he wanted to come out, and on the wall being knocked down he walked forth rather thinner than before, but otherwise much as usual. On one occasion he saw some children pelting each other with unripe plums, and promised to supply ripe ones if they would shut their eyes for a minute. They all did so, but one little urchin peeped through the corner of his eyes and saw the holy man take off his cap and walk three times solemnly round it, and then take it up and shake the ripe fruit out. So when they had eaten all the plums the boy told his companions how the miracle had been performed. On this the saint cursed him, saying that his descendants should always be one-eyed. There was a man named Jasir also against whom the saint uttered this imprecation that his family should be always unsuccessful, and that sweep as they might their houses should never be free from spiders. Both these curses, Talib Ali,\nsays, were in force against the families of the original offenders in his day.\n\n\"Syud Gudun married first a Syud's daughter from Mohan, and when she died, leaving a young child, Shah Mahomed, he married a Pathan girl of Moradabad. Shah Mahomed was very sickly, and a fakeer predicted that if any woman would wave a vessel of water round his head, and give the water to another child to drink, the sickness would pass to that child, and Shah Mahomed would recover. The Pathan woman did this, and gave the water to her own son who died, and immediately afterwards Shah Mahomed recovered.\n\n\"When Syud Gudun died his son was a child, and his brother Gul Ali managed the estate. He was mortally wounded at Mohan in a fight with the Amil, who wanted to seize the daughter of the widow of a Syud there. Gul Ali had seven sons and died exhorting them to acknowledge Shah Mahomed as their head, and to have no quarrel with him. This exhortation they at once disregarded, and claimed a separate share in the estate. The case was referred to the Lodh zamindars of Dhora Muntria (pargana Mohan), who had a neem tree of such peculiar virtues that no one sitting under it could decide unjustly. The Lodhs heard their several arguments, and adjourned the case till next day. Then offering hospitality to the litigants, they sent them out some cooked food, one brass and seven earthen plates, one chair and seven bundles of grass. The seven brothers unanimously gave up the brass plate and the chair to Shah Mahomed, and took the others themselves. The Lodhs then said,\u2014you have yourselves decided the case by allowing Shah Mahomed's superiority\u2014how then can you sue for equal shares?' So they decided to give two-thirds of the estate to him, and the remaining third to his seven cousins remarking that Shah Mahomed would still have the expense of feeding all the travellers, fakeers, &c., and keeping up the credit of his house. The cousins were dissatisfied, and appealed to the Syuds of Suffeepore, but got a similar decision.\n\n\"Shah Mahomed's son, Syud Talib, had the misfortune of being a hen-pecked man. He married in Fatehpur, and was regularly driven from his home by his wife's violent temper. He wandered about the world till she died, and then he came home again, after which as this misfortune was his sole claim to a place in history, he very appropriately died. Syud Talib had three sons, who increased their estates by acting as security for defaulting zamindars, and if they were not paid taking the village. They seized on the village of Rao in this way, but the Bisein zamindars attacked and murdered them. On this Mohabut Khan, Governor of Oudh, and Tahowur Khan, Foujdar of Baiswara, and Syud Anwar, Jagheerdar of Rasoolabad, received orders from Dehli to punish the murderers. They did so, utterly destroying the village, and leaving in its place merely the great mound which now stands to the north-west of the present village of the same name.\n\n\"Mahomed Mah succeeded to the estate. His younger brother, Noor-ood-deen, took service in the Deckan, and received the parganas Oonao,\nSuffepore, and Jajmow in jagheer. When he was getting old and weary of the labour of managing this estate, he bribed the Canoongoes to draw up a certificate of his death, and sending it in the jagheer was transferred to another person, and he returned to his home to spend the rest of his days in peace. Mahomed Mah built the large house in Oonao, with the pillared verandah, which belongs to his descendant Dost Ali.\n\n\"His son, Dost Mahomed, accompanied Nawab Khwaja Bakur Khan, Naib of Sadut Khan, to the great fight at Sichendie (in Cawnpore) with Hindoo Singh, Chundele, and there he was killed. There are Biseins living in four or five villages of pargana Unao who are descendants of Raja Unwant, and it is said that when Mahomed was lying under a tree, badly wounded in that battle, some of these Biseins came and cut off his head in satisfaction of the old feud which belonged to thirteen generations ago. A relation of his, Gholam Rusool Ali, was in Ismail Khan's Resala, and crossed the Gogra with Sufdur Jung, and took part in his fight with the Gonda Raja. But happening to displease Ismail Khan he was beaten so severely that he died.\n\n\"Dost Mahomed's son Talib Ali, (the author of the chronicle before alluded to), was in the Dehli service, but on hearing of Gholam Rusool's fate threw it up in disgust and came home. From that time no member of this family entered the military service of Dehli or Lucknow. They confined themselves to their duties as zamindars and chowdries.\n\n\"Talib Ali had five sons, two of whom were childless, and two died before their father. He was succeeded by Badshah Ali, and on his dying childless the estate passed to Farzand Ali, son of Talib Ali's youngest son. He was the father of Dost Ali, the present talookdar.\"\n\nThe following account of the military operations in Unao prior to the relief of Lucknow in September, 1857, is based on the official reports quoted or abstracted in Ball's Mutiny in India, Vol. II., page 16.\n\n\"On the 28th July, 1857, General Havelock, who had crossed the Ganges at Cawnpore, and advanced six miles to Mangalwar, telegraphed as follows:\u2014\n\n\"Our losses from cholera are becoming serious, and extend to General Neill's force as well as my own. I urgently hope that the 5th and 90th can be pushed on to me entire, and with all despatch, and every disposable detachment of the regiments now under my command may be sent on. My whole force only amounts to 1,500 men, of whom under 1,200 are British, and ten guns imperfectly equipped and manned.\"\n\nCarrying out the intention expressed in the preceding telegram, Brigadier-General Havelock, on the morning of the 29th, commenced his march towards Lucknow. The force moved off their camping ground at Mangalwar as the day broke, aware that opposition awaited them at a village called Unao, about three miles from their starting point, and consequently they were not surprised when, on nearing the place, three guns opened upon them. Two field-pieces were immediately brought forward and silenced them; but as the troops moved on a line of white puffs of\nsmoke from the orchard and garden walls surrounding the place indicated that the matchlockmen intended to stand their ground. On this the skirmishers rushed forward, and drove the enemy out of the orchard into the village, leaving the three guns in the possession of the British, who pushing forward attempted to clear the village, but met with a resistance they were not at the moment prepared for.\n\nThe mud-walled villages of Oudh and their fighting inhabitants are among the peculiar features of the country. Every hamlet is at chronic feud with its neighbour; and all of them look upon open rebellion against the farmer of their taxes as a sacred duty. The consequence is that a century of practical experience in the art of self-defence had converted those villages into almost impregnable fortifications, and the villagers themselves into excellent garrison troops. A hundred Oudh men would flee from the attack of ten English soldiers on an open plain; but if ten Oudhians are placed behind a loopholed mud-wall, they will hold their position without shrinking and not consider it much of an achievement. Such was the case in the petty village of Unao. The enemy were completely hidden behind walls; the British troops were in the place and all round it, and yet they could comparatively do nothing, and were dropping fast under the bullets of their unseen foes. Thrice did a portion of them charge a mud-walled enclosure filled with men, and thrice were they driven back with heavy loss. At length it was determined to fire the place; the artillery drew back, portfires were laid to the thatch, and the men of the light companies stood waiting around the outskirts, with eager eyes and rifles cocked, like terriers waiting for the rats to rush out.\n\nJust at this moment, while the thatch was crackling amidst the spreading flames, the field engineer of the force, who had gone round to the front of the village by himself to reconnoitre came spurting back in hot haste with the information that a very large force of infantry, cavalry, and guns was rapidly advancing from the other side upon Unao. Upon this, the task of finishing off the rebels in the burning village was left to the Sikhs, and the whole British force was ordered to turn the position by the right, and move on to the front as quickly as possible.\n\nThis, however, was no easy matter as far as the artillery was concerned; for the ground was heavy, and the guns frequently stuck fast in the swamp for five minutes together under a galling fire of matchlocks. At length the main road was reached again, and the force pushed on through the groves which encircled the place.\n\nBeyond the trees lay a level swampy plain of vast extent traversed by a main road, along which was seen approaching a force of about 6,000 men, bearing down on our right and left flanks, with their guns in advance; the distance between the opposing columns being about 1,500 yards. The leading gun of the English troops was immediately unlimbered and opened upon the insurgents, with a view to arrest their progress, and give the infantry time to deploy; while the other guns, as they came up one by one, went into action in line with the first. By this time the enemy's artillery had closed to within a thousand yards, and\nopened fire. The sun fortunately was at the back of the English guns, and they could distinctly see the objects they were to fire at; and consequently in about ten minutes they had silenced the enemy's leading guns, and the whole of the English force moved forward with the artillery in the centre. The immense disproportion between the attacking column and the force of the enemy was a subject of hilarity among the troops, as their small thin line struggled forward knee-deep in swamp, with sloped arms, to encounter the vast masses of infantry and cavalry that swarmed in front of them. Not one of those grim and bearded Englishmen but felt confident of victory, and a groan ran through the line, \"Oh that we had cavalry to cut the dogs up!\"\n\nDuring this advance, the artillery came into action as opportunity occurred, and, still pressing forward, gun after gun was abandoned on the road; while those in the front and on the left flank stuck in the swamp, and were left to their fate. At last the English artillery got up near enough to tell upon the rebel infantry; while the saddles of the cavalry began to empty rapidly under the fire of the Enfield rifles. Presently the enemy's horsemen went threes about; there was a wavering among the infantry; and then, as if a sudden panic had seized them, they rushed off the field to a village in the distance across the plain, where they were afterwards discovered huddled together like a flock of sheep leaving the British in possession of the road and of fifteen captured guns. It was now past 2 o'clock P.M., and the troops halted where they stood for a couple of hours to cook and eat.\n\nAfter this refreshment the force again marched forward about eight miles to a large walled village named Bashiratganj, also surrounded by swamps to which the enemy had retired, and where they showed an intention to make a stand. On approaching this place three more guns were found to be in position; two behind a mud-wall built across the road and one on an elevated mud bastion. The two guns on the road were quickly silenced by the fire of the English artillery; but the one on the bastion continued to give some trouble until a well directed 9-pounder dismounted it and prevented further annoyance from that quarter. The sepoys at this place made but a feeble defence, and were quickly driven out of the village; but the matchlockmen, on the contrary, fought boldly and well, although uselessly, for Havelock's men had now become fierce and flushed with success, and nothing could withstand their impetuosity as house after house was stormed and carried, until the village was finally evacuated.\n\nThe pertinacity of one of the villagers at this place was remarkable. He had stationed himself in a little mud fort at the entrance of the place (which was almost the first position carried), and had contrived to hide himself, thus escaping the fate of his comrades in the general bayoneting. As soon as the main body of the English had passed on this man emerged from his shelter, and plied his solitary matchlock with effect at the guns, the baggage, the elephants, or anything that came within range. His bravery amused the men of the rear-guard, who, as he was not a sepoy, would have spared him if possible, and they\nrepeatedly called to him to desist; but their humanity was thrown away, and the result was that a party of Sikhs went and smoked him out of the fort, and the poor wretch was shot through the head as he was crossing over the parapet for a last hit at his enemies.\n\nThe loss of the enemy at Unao is estimated by native report at 1,500 killed and wounded. It might in truth amount to 500; it was lighter at Bashiratganj. In these two combats nineteen guns were captured from the enemy.\n\n\"I must praise the conduct of all my staff officers. Lieutenant-Colonel Tytler, hardly able from indisposition to sit on his horse, set throughout the day an example of daring and activity; Lieutenant Havelock, Deputy Assistant Adjutant-General, had a horse shot under him; Lieutenant Seton, my acting Aide-de-camp, was severely wounded; Major Stephenson, at the head of the Madras Fusiliers, showed throughout the day how the calmest forethought can be united with the utmost daring.\"\n\nThe victorious troops encamped on the night of the 29th on the causeway beyond the village of Bashiratganj, having fought from sunrise to sunset, with an interval of three hours during the heat of the day, and captured nineteen guns, amongst which were two complete 9-pounder English batteries, new from the Cossipore foundry.\n\nThe loss during the day's fight was heavy for the small force engaged, namely, 100 men killed and wounded; and as the number of wounded took up nearly the whole available sick carriage of the force, considerable embarrassment might have arisen on account of the wounded in a future action before the supply had been augmented. The contingency was, however, foreseen and guarded against.\n\nThe next battle took place in the ensuing month. General Havelock left his fortified camp at Mangalwar on the 4th August, bivouacked for the night at Unao, and on the following morning received intelligence that the enemy had re-occupied the town of Bashiratganj in considerable strength. He immediately commanded the advance, and on reaching a serai about six miles distant from the bivouac found the information correct. Two heavy guns and two 24-pounder howitzers were at once pushed forward by the road, while six guns, with the 78th Highlanders and Sikhs under Colonel Hamilton, proceeded to turn the left of the village; and the 1st Madras Fusiliers and 84th Foot covered the turning column with the heavy guns. By this movement the enemy was speedily expelled from the serai, but still obstinately held the villages on the other side of the street beyond it. At length they were driven out by the artillery, and the troops advanced, the heavy guns silencing some guns of the enemy posted on the right and left of the road, which were, however, withdrawn by the rebels, who retired slowly\u2014forced back but not beaten. The troops then passed through the village and came to the causeway crossing the swamp, from the other side of which a hot fire of matchlocks and guns was kept up both on the causeway and on the right wing of the English force which returned their fire across the water with interest. Taking advantage of the diversion thus made, the 84th dashed across the\ncauseway, and began skirmishing on the other side. The heavy guns followed and opened fire at grape range on the enemy's cavalry who were scattered to the winds by four volleys.\n\nThe troops were now in a richly cultivated country, studded with hamlets, every one of which swarmed with matchlockmen. Crossing the causeway, the whole force spread out to the right and left engaging the villagers and driving back the sepoys in front, and thus passed through the belt of cultivation, emerging upon an extensive open plain, on which were half a dozen different camps crowded with troops, and as many fortified villages occupied by matchlockmen. The artillery immediately opened fire on a camp in which a large red and white striped tent rose above the rest, surrounded by a strong body of cavalry and infantry with several guns, the whole of whom made a precipitate retreat the moment the 24-pounder grape-shot and shrapnell began to drop amongst them. Unfortunately the British guns were too far in advance of the infantry, and could not venture to follow without support. A halt was therefore sounded, to allow the remaining troops time to come up, and when the whole had joined, the men were ordered to cook and eat, while a consultation was held as to the expediency of pursuing the advantage already gained or of returning to Mangalwar. The result of the deliberation was an order to return thither without delay.\n\nFrom the evening of the 6th until the morning of 11th of August the troops remained in camp at Mangalwar, during which time a council was held as to the expediency of re-crossing the Ganges and falling back upon Cawnpore. That measure was ultimately decided upon, and arrangements for the purpose were made by the field engineer, who selected a spot for the embarkation considerably lower down than the place formerly crossed by the troops. The river at this place was much narrower; but to reach it a succession of swamps and creeks had to be crossed. Causeways were thrown across the former, and the latter were bridged with boats in an incredibly short space of time considering the amount of work to be done, and the very inefficient means at the disposal of the engineer officers. The commissariat stores and baggage were sent down daily and passed over; and finally, on the morning of the 11th, an order was issued that all the bedding (the only article of baggage the troops had been allowed to keep) was to be sent across the river immediately. The troops consequently anticipated that they would have to follow during the night; but their astonishment may be conceived when, at three o'clock in the afternoon, the bugles sounded \"the turn-out;\" and they learned that they were for the third time to advance to the front, in consequence of information that the enemy had come down to Unao, with the intent to attack them during their passage across the river. The troops accordingly marched off with their arms in their hands and their clothes on their backs, and not another thing. When they reached Unao it was found that the information was false, and not a single rebel was to be seen. During the halt, however, preparatory to retracing their steps, information reached the General that the enemy under the impression that the British troops had actually crossed the Ganges two days previous had come down in force to Bashiratganj; and that 4,000 infantry and 500 cavalry, with\none horse-battery and some guns were then lying encamped in front of that place. Having now advanced so far, it was felt to be impossible to retreat in the face of the enemy without exchanging shots; and accordingly the troops, after a scanty supper, bivouacked that night on the plain, and with the first streak of dawn marched to the encounter.\n\nMeantime the enemy having intelligence of the advance had worked hard all night intrenching themselves; and when the troops arrived in front they were found strongly posted; their right resting on the village of Bourse-ki-Chauki in advance of the town, which they had strongly fortified; their left on a mound about 400 yards distant, which they had cut down into a battery and mounted with three guns; the interval between being connected by a ditch and breastwork, lined with infantry, having cavalry massed on their left flank to act as opportunity might offer. To oppose the troops thus strongly posted, the British force did not consist of more than 800 effective men in the field, 200 having been left behind to guard the approaches to the river.\n\nThe plan of battle was soon formed. The 78th Fusiliers and four guns moved off on the right to attack the left of the enemy's position, the heavy guns on the left, supported by the 84th, went along the road to engage the enemy's right battery, and the remaining part of the force and guns took the centre. General Havelock was much retarded in bringing his battery and supporting troops across the deep and wide morasses that protected the enemy's front; during which operation the shot and shell of the rebels caused him severe loss; but on the right of the column the ground was good, and the men being fresh moved fast, and soon came into collision with the enemy's left. This movement appeared to annoy them much, and they turned the principal part of their guns in that direction. An officer writing of this engagement says:\u2014\"I certainly was never under so heavy a fire in my life. In five minutes after we came into action every man at the gun I was laying was wounded with grape, except the sergeant and myself; and four of our gun cattle were knocked over by round shot. The other three guns suffered nearly as much, and we found our fire had little effect on the battery in front; their guns were too well protected. So we limbered up and got away as fast as we could, taking ground more to the right, and then found it was possible to move still more forward and take the adverse battery in flank. This was accordingly done, and then we had our revenge, for they could only bring one gun to bear on us, while we, with our four, enfiladed their whole position. At this time we were within 500 yards of the enemy's cavalry, who, if they had had one atom of pluck, could have charged and taken our guns with the most perfect ease; but a handful of fusiliers, with their Enfields, lying down on our right, and the small body of volunteer horse drawn up in our rear, made us feel perfectly secure, and so we went on pounding the battery without paying the slightest attention to the horse-men. Presently an artillery waggon was seen creeping out of the battery\u2014that was instantly knocked over; and soon after a lucky shrapnell silenced the one gun which was firing direct at us. Our fire grew hotter than ever, and at last a swarm of men was seen rushing back in confusion from the trenches. Hereupon a cheer ran along the whole of our advancing lines.\nThe 78th quickened their pace before breaking into one of their magnificent charges, and the fusiliers on our right dashed forward with a yell in loose skirmishing order at the left flank of a large grove which extended along the rear of the enemy's position and was full of men. The 78th went straight at the battery, which still remained crowded with men, the gunners working their two remaining guns to the last, and only bolting when our men were at the foot of the slope, carrying off with them one gun, the team of which had escaped the shrapnel of our artillery. After bayoneting all they could catch, the 78th turned the two captured guns on the enemy. Some artillerymen came into the battery immediately after, and we had the intense satisfaction of giving the flying foe three rounds from each of their own guns.\"\n\nThe position was carried about the same time at all points, the enemy flying in headlong haste from the chastisement they had provoked. On the left of the position, as they had the advantage of the road, they managed to carry off their guns, the cavalry being unable to pursue them through the swamps, and the infantry were too much exhausted by fatigue and hunger to follow them up. Having contented themselves, therefore, with driving the enemy clear through and away from the village, the force halted for a short time to breathe, and then leisurely marched back to Unao where they cooked some food, and in the cool of the evening retraced their steps to Mangalwar. On the following morning (the 13th) the troops moved down to the river, and, owing to the excellence of the arrangements by the engineer, they were all crossed over and housed on the Cawnpore side by nightfall of the same day.\n\nLegends and traditions.\u2014The principal legends and religious traditions connected with the district of Unao are concerned with the following places:\n\nPurwa, where stands the great temple of Billeswar Mah\u00e1deo. Parsandan, where Paras R\u00e1m is said to have been born to the holy sage Jamdagni.\n\nSarwan, where R\u00e1ja Dasrath of Ajodhya killed the holy Rishi Sarwan; he shot him by night as he stooped to drink at the edge of a tank.\n\nPariar, where S\u00edta is said to have been cast forth, when R\u00e1m Chandr, king of Ajodhya, divorced her. Here she gave birth to her son Lava, and here her adopted son Kus founded the city of Kusumbhi, long afterwards described by the Buddhist pilgrims. The great jh\u00edl, which almost surrounds Pariar, is called Mahna, a corruption from Mah\u00e1ran, the great fight in which the sons of R\u00e1m Chandr, unaided, vanquished the mighty armies sent by their father.\n\nAt Maur\u00e1nw\u00e1n is said to have formerly reigned M\u00faraddhuj, who celebrated the Ashwamed simultaneously with the P\u00e1ndus at Hastinapur.\n\nAt Asoha Ashwasth\u00e1ma, the Brahman, who murdered the five young children of Draupadi in their sleep, and whose life was spared because he\nwas a Brahman, stayed for a time in his Cain-like wandering over the world, and here he is still worshipped.\n\nThe river Loni in Unao is said to have first commenced to flow in the following mysterious way:\u2014The great magician Dhanattar was proceeding to cure king Parichhit, when a snake demon, Takshak, who was predestined to kill that king\u2014in other words the Scythian to conquer the Arian\u2014met him assuming the form of a man and asked him, \"whither goest thou?\" He said, \"I go to Lomas Rishi who has called me, for the Takshak will bite R\u00e1ja Parichhit, and I am to heal him.\" Then the Takshak said, \"I am the Takshak, and whatever I bite that I destroy. I will bite the r\u00e1ja, and who is there that can cure the wound?\" And Dhanattar answered, \"whatever I look at I restore it even as it was, and my sight is the only limit to my power.\" The Takshak said, \"see there is a pipal tree with birds on it,\" and he touched it, and the birds died and the tree fell away into a heap of dust. The Baid then looked upon the tree, and instantly it became tall and green again as it had been before, and the birds were alive in its branches. On seeing this the Takshak departed, and made himself into a little rod of gold, and laid himself down in the path by which the Baid was to come. Dhanattar saw the stick, and wondering at it took it up. As he went he carried it now in this hand, and now in that, and at last he laid it across his shoulder. Then the Takshak, who was the stick, bit Dhanattar behind on the back of his neck, so that he could not see the wound to cure it.\n\nWhen he was bitten, Dhanattar knew that he had been deceived, and he went home again, and told his sons that the Takshak had bitten him and he must die, for he could not see the wound. But he said, \"when I am dead take you my body, and roast the flesh and eat it; then shall my skill, and all the learning that I have learned, descend to you, and your name shall be great. But be not deceived if any forbid you this, and answer that it is my order.\" Having said this he died, and his sons took his body, and cut the flesh from off the bones, and cooked it in a caldron, and prepared to eat it. But the Takshak took the form of a Brahman and came to the house, and said, \"what is this that you mean to do? Was ever such a thing heard in the land, that a son should eat his father's flesh? Are ye utterly without religion? Or do ye think that the words of a man in whose blood the poison is running, and who is at the point of death, should be obeyed in such a thing as this?\" Then they were ashamed, and taking up the flesh they placed it in the caldron on the water of the Ganges, and left it there. It floated down the river, and Ganga watched over it that none should do it harm, and cast it gently ashore beneath the sacred temple of Pariar. A woman of the Cham\u00e1r caste named Lona who lived at Unao was washing there, and seeing that there was meat in the vessel she took it and began to eat. And as she ate the wisdom of Dhanattar passed into her, and she became skilful in cures and medicines, and if any was bitten by a snake she healed him.\n\nThere came a day when all the people of Unao were transplanting the young rice plants from their seed bed into the wider fields in which they were to grow. Every man brought the plants in a basket, and threw\nthem out in one place where Lona Cham\u00e1rin was standing, but when they came back with another basketful, they found that Lona had already planted out all the plants which were in the heap. When they saw this they wondered greatly, and said \"we are two hundred men bringing baskets of plants\u2014how can one woman plant out so many all alone.\" So at last when the rest went away after emptying their baskets, her brother-in-law stayed behind and hid himself. He watched and saw that when all were gone, Lona stripped herself naked, and took up the heap in her hands, and muttered words and cast the plants into the air, and all the rice plants planted themselves out in order, each in its proper line and place. Then he cried out in his astonishment, and when she saw that she was watched, she was overpowered with shame, and crouching down tried to escape. Her brother-in-law followed to reassure her, but she fled the faster, and as she fled the earth opened before her, and behind her all the water from the rice fields collecting in one wave flowed down the channel which she made. At first she crouched as she ran, but when she saw she was pursued she rose up, and the channel became deeper, and the wave behind her rose higher, and fear added wings to her flight.\n\nSo she sped along, carrying destruction through the country as she ran, passing through the town of New\u00e1yan, till at last reached the Ganges at Dalmau, and rushed into it, and hid her shame in its water. The channel which she made is called the Loni nadi to this day. The flood destroyed the town of New\u00e1yan, and left nothing but a high mound which stands close to the brink of the stream. The raja of New\u00e1yan was named Ranb\u00edr, and he escaped with his life from the submerged city, and most of the people escaped also. He sought a place wherein to inhabit; and one day as he was hunting his dogs pursued a hare, and the hare turned on them and drove them off. Then he said \"there must be some strange strength in this place, since even the most timid animals if they live here become bold and fierce;\" so he built a city there, and called it Ranb\u00edr-pur, and established his kingdom there.\n\nIn those days the town of B\u00e1ngarmau was not, and the surrounding country took its name from the city of R\u00e1mkot. Little is known of the early history of this town, but its ruins, which lie in the north-west corner of this district overlooking the river Sai, still testify to its grandeur and extent. Some of the mounds which mark the site of the ancient buildings are still one hundred feet in height, and the ruins extend over a circumference of several miles. This was the seat of the R\u00e1jp\u00e1si power, which extended far to the west and north of R\u00e1mkot. The R\u00e1jp\u00e1si is still found in great numbers through all the Hardoi district, and in parts of Sitapur. The last of the lords of R\u00e1mkot, R\u00e1ja Santhar by name, threw off his allegiance to Kanauj, and refused to pay the annual tribute. On this R\u00e1ja Jai Chand gave to Alha and Udal the grant abovementioned of all the G\u00e1njar country, and they attacked and destroyed R\u00e1mkot, leaving it the shapeless mass of ruins which we now find it. The streams which run between the various mounds cut away the d\u00e9bris, and lay bare at times the massive walls made of enormous bricks un cemented, or sometimes turn up relics of the past, caskets full of dust which once was embroidered apparel, but which crumbles to the touch, or gold coins and\njewels with quaint and uncouth legends. But to those that find them such treasures ever are as fairy gifts, bringing misfortune and misery into the family, and dragging the possessors down to irretrievable poverty.\n\nBilleswar.\u2014In days so ancient that no record of their antiquity remains, and men are in doubt whether it were the golden or the second age, a herdsman pastured his cattle in the plains and forest glades where Purwa now stands. The pasturage was rich and fertile, but day after day one of his cows came home with udders all drawn dry. His suspicion fell on a boy who herded the cattle, and he threatened him with grievous punishment if it were he that daily drank the milk of the cow. The boy sought to clear himself of the suspicion, and watched the cow carefully. One day as he followed her he saw that at noon tide she stood still, and her milk fell on the ground. He told his master, and he also came and saw the wondrous sight, that no one milked the cow, but the milk ran down of itself. Then going closer to the spot he saw that it was an image of Mah\u00e1deo on which the milk was falling. He took the image up and worshipped it; and as days passed on, the fame of it was noised abroad, so that men came from afar to adore it, and one built a temple to place it in, and one dug a tank close by the door of the temple, and the tank is there to this day.\n\nSarwan.\u2014To worship at this temple and to shoot and hunt in the wild forest country around came R\u00e1ja Dasrath from Ajodhya, the father of R\u00e1m Chandr, the fifty-seventh R\u00e1ja of Ajodhya in direct descent from its great founder Ikshw\u00e1ku. He was encamped at Sarw\u00e1ra on the edge of a tank. By night came Sarwan, a holy Rishi from Chaunsa (near Adjodhya), by caste a Bani\u00e1n. He was going on pilgrimage and was carrying his blind father and mother in a k\u00e1war slung over his shoulders. Reaching the tank he put his burden down and stopped to drink. R\u00e1ja Dasrath heard a rustling noise, and thinking it was some wild beast took up his bow and shot an arrow which struck Sarwan and he died. Then his blind parents in their misery lifted up their voices and cursed the man who had done that thing. They prayed that as he had slain the son who was the delight of their hearts, so he might have trouble and sorrow from his own children, and might die of grief, even as they were dying. Having so said they gave up the ghost, and from that day to this no Chhattri has lived in the town which is founded on the spot and is called Sarwan. Many Rajputs have tried it, but evil has overtaken them in one way or another. The tank remains to this day, and by it lies under a tree the body of Sarwan, a figure of stone; and as he died with his thirst unquenched, so if water is poured into the navel of the stone figure, the hole can never be filled up, but is inexhaustible in its demand.\n\nIt then appears that the religious traditions of the place are connected with Mah\u00e1deo who has three great temples. Billeswar at Purwa, Ajleswar at Panhan also in this district, Khereswar near Shuri\u00e1jpur and Cawnpore. At Pachh\u00e1n and Kusumbhi there are temples of Debi, but no trace whatever exists of the matrimonial alliance which is said to have existed between the two divinities.\nUna is no doubt fortunate in the numerous visits paid by divine or semi-divine beings to it. No other district in Oudh except perhaps Sitapur can boast such a galaxy of places enlightened by divine halos. On the whole it is most probable that the events which constituted the germs of the miraculous tales now current really did occur in this district which no doubt served for centuries as the dark forest land of myth, of fable, and adventure for the more civilized regions on the west of the Ganges.\n\nArchaeology.\u2014In November, 1874, a large number of coins were discovered in the village of Simri, in pargana Asoha Parsandan, near the river Sai, tahsil Purwa. They were in an earthen pot just buried under the surface on the site of an old village. The finders were three labourers; they reported that there were a great number of small cubical gold coins about the size of gram seeds; the police authorities on making a search could only recover from the landlord who had removed them to his premises about eleven hundred silver coins, the finders allege that there were above four thousand of these. What are left are of considerable interest; twenty-seven carefully weighed by myself weighed 6\u00bd tolas or an average of 41\u00bd grains each. They are of alloyed metals, Apparently silver and tin, while some of them exhibit large traces of copper. Without an exception almost they exhibit the Buddhist prayer wheel (or as some think the sun), the other symbols are the sacred tree, and the Chaitya emblem; the type is that shown in Plate XX., Thomas Prinsep's Antiquities, but many are found other than those then engraved. The deer often appears, the taurus sign, and many mysterious symbols of which I can discover no interpretation. The large majority are only stamped on one side, but a few have apparently been cast in a mould; there are no inscriptions or traces of characters whatever; there is no trace of the Swastika emblem either, and for these reasons we may conclude that some of them are very early specimens of the Hindu mint, probably 300 years prior to the Christian era, and that even the latest date before that epoch.\n\nAsoha pargana is one of the ancient centres of myth and tradition in Oudh. Here Ashwasthama, the Brahman who came by night and cut off the heads of Draupadis' five children, is said to have paused in his pilgrimage of expiation, and the pargana is called after him.*\n\nThese coins are certainly, though of allied type, earlier than those engraved by Prinsep, which he places at the commencement of the Christian era.\u2020 The fact that all the coins in the large hoard are Buddhist, and the infinite vanity of the type, would indicate that a continuous dynasty of many Buddhist kings had governed the country around for many generations; this we know from Hiouen Thsang to be probable enough. We hardly want this evidence to show how completely the Hindu faith had been banished from Oudh; on none of these coins do we find a ling or any of the boars or first emblems of Mah\u00e1deo and Vishnu, which afterwards became so common. Not a trace of anything which the Hindus now hold sacred appears in these relics of a past which, compared\n\n* Elliott's Oonac, pages 14\u201415.\n\u2020 Thomas Prinsep, Vol. I., page 217.\nto the alleged antiquity of the Hindu faith, is modern. Antiquarians regard this type as the earliest of pure Hindu coinages, and the specimens in question are apparently about the most rude and ancient yet discovered in India.\n\nUNAO Pargana\u2014Tahsil UNAO\u2014District UNAO.\u2014The history of the pargana is given under that of the town. It lies north of the Ganges; its area is 64 square miles or 41,081 acres, of which 20,281 are cultivated and 11,663 are barren; most of this is irrigated, only 6,849 acres being unirrigated. The population is 33,725 or 328 to the square mile; of these 2,049 are Chhattis, 3,580 Brahmins; there are only 116 Kurmis, but 6,100 Lodhs\u2014a curious feature. The Government revenue is Rs. 53,663, which falls at the rate of Rs. 2-10-4 per acre on cultivation and Re. 1-13-4 on arable land. There is probably some mistake in the census, as otherwise this revenue would be a strangely high one compared with pargana Sikandarpur or Safipur for instance.\n\nThere are no local traditions connected with the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1r\u00e1t or R\u00e1m\u00e1yan in this pargana. The earliest settlement of Muhammadians in the Unao district dates from the end of the 13th century or the beginning of the 14th, and that was in the B\u00e1ngarmau pargana. \"Sayyad Bah\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn, son of Sayyad Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn, who was killed at the taking of Safipur, was the conqueror of the Bisens of Unao, and the founder of the Muhammadian family who have large estates in that pargana.\" The members of this family (of which the present head is the taluqdar Chaudhri Dost Ali) have long confined themselves to their duties as zamindars and chaudhris. There is a shrine in the village Gujauli to the memory of a saint who accompanied the army of Sayyad S\u00e1l\u00e9r. There is a fair held in the month of June, but it is only attended by about 500 pilgrims. The earliest zamindars known in pargana Unao were Bisens. They were annihilated by the Zaidi Sayyad from Wasit, of whom Bah\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn above-mentioned was the leader. These Sayyads still retain the zamindari of 9 villages out of 38 in the pargana.\n\nThe pargana is of an irregular shape, 10 miles long (east and west) and 3 miles broad. It abounds in mahua and mango groves. Its soil is principally loam and clay (mati\u00e1r); a fine friable mould of a dark slate colour. Water is found at an average depth of 40 feet. Sugarcane is not largely grown; tobacco, wheat, and rice thrive well.\n\nThe land is held thus:\n\n| Taluqdari | Sub-settlement | Zamindari | Pattidari |\n|-----------|----------------|-----------|-----------|\n| ...       | ...            | ...       | ...       |\n| ...       | ...            | ...       | ...       |\n| ...       | ...            | ...       | ...       |\n\nTotal: 41,080 acres.\n\nUNAO\u2014Pargana UNAO\u2014Tahsil UNAO\u2014District UNAO.\u2014Unao, a town in the pargana of the same name, is the headquarters of the tahsil and district authorities. It lies nine miles north-east from Cawnpore, from which city a railway and a metalled road pass through it to Lucknow.\nUnmetalled roads are constructed to Hardoi and Bareli; there is no river in its vicinity. There were formerly extensive jungles on the site of the present town. About 1,100 years ago Godo Singh, a Chauhan Thakur, an officer in the army of a Bengal raja, cleared off the jungle and founded a town which he called Sarai Godo. He left it shortly afterwards, and the place passed into the hands of Raja Ajipal, a prince of the Chandrabansi or Lunar race of the Chhattis reigning at Kanauj. Khande Singh was made governor. His lieutenant, Unwant Singh, a Bisen, murdered him; built a fort here, and having acquired independent authority renamed the place after himself. About 1450 A.D. a great battle was fought here. Raja Umrawat Singh, son of Raja Jagdeo Singh, and descendant of Unwant Singh, was a bigoted Hindu, and would not allow the Musalmans to sound the azan or pray in public. Some Sayyads organized an expedition against him, got into his fort by stratagem during a feast, killed him, and took possession of the estate. The present taluqdar, Chaudhri Dost Ali, is descended from their leader. Among his ancestors Bah\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn and Sayyad Husen distinguished themselves; they were entrusted with the government by the Delhi sovereigns, and founded several villages, among others Dostinagar and Baida Abbaspur. In the reign of Shah Jah\u00e1n Fateh-ulla, of a Sheikh family, settled here and was made governor. Some fine buildings of his erection still remain. One of his descendants, Molvi Ihsan Ali, a poet of repute, was attached as such to the court of Nawab Saadat Ali. One Gopal Das was appointed qanungo by Sher Shah, and his descendant Raja Nand Kishore was chakladar for some time. A battle was fought here in 1857 on July 29th between General Havelock's forces and the mutineers who were defeated with loss.\n\nThe town is pleasantly situated, the soil is loamy, to the west lie many picturesque groves and gardens; the water in some of the wells is brackish; it is met with at a great distance; some of the wells being 112 feet deep. There are the usual buildings for administrative purposes. The school is well attended by 234 pupils, of whom only 36 are Musalmans; nearly half of those attending learn English. There are no manufactures of note except one of pera\u2014a kind of sweetmeat.\n\nThe population is 7,277, as follows:\n\n| Community   | Number |\n|-------------|--------|\n| Musalmans   | 2,554  |\n| Brahmins    | 649    |\n| Chhattis    | 60     |\n| Kayaths     | 335    |\n| Pasis       | 173    |\n| Ahirs       | 448    |\n| Other Hindus| 8,122  |\n\nThere are 1,895 houses, of which 150 are of masonry. There are two Thakurdwaras or temples to Vishnu, 12 to Mahadeo, and 10 mosques. The annual value of the sale in the daily market is Rs. 33,000. It is a prosperous and improving place, but during some part of the year is reckoned unhealthy; the water stagnates round the town, being pent up by the railway embankment.\n\nLatitude 26\u00b034' north; longitude 80\u00b032' east.\nUTARDHANI\u2014Pargana B\u00c1NGARMAU\u2014Taheil SAFIPUR\u2014District UNAO.\u2014This village is 8 miles north-west of Safipur, and 25 miles in the same direction from Unao. The road from Lucknow to Hardoi passing through B\u00e1ngarmau is one mile from it towards the north. The date of its foundation is not known, but it is certain that at the time of Sayyad S\u00e1l\u00e1r's invasion, one Mi\u00e1n Gh\u00e1zi of Dohni, a respectable and rich merchant, came here, got the jungle cleared, and settled Musalman K\u00e1chhis at this place. The soil is mostly loam with some clay. It is on a plain. No jungle, scenery ordinary, climate excellent, water good. Population 1,349\u2014Hindus 999, Musalmans 350. There are 284 mud-walled houses.\n\nUTRAULA Pargana\u2020\u2014Taheil UTRAULA\u2014District GONDA.\u2014Bounded on the north by the R\u00e1pti, on the south by the Kuw\u00e1na, on the west by the Balr\u00e1mpur pargana, and on the east by Basti, from which it is divided by the R\u00e1pti and Suw\u00e1wan rivers along a part of its frontier; this pargana is a rough oval, containing an area of 200 square miles. The banks of the R\u00e1pti are from ten to twenty feet high along the greater part of its course, and the high land is succeeded at a distance of a few hundred yards from the river by a low clayey hollow. The water which overflows in the rains runs off the high bank into the hollow beneath, and settling there makes grand rice fields when the rains are moderate or a lake some feet deep when they are excessive. To the south of this the land becomes again a few feet higher and produces all kinds of crops, but particularly winter rice in great luxuriance. The Suw\u00e1wan river runs through the centre of the pargana, and the tract between that and the Kuw\u00e1na forms the commencement of the uparh\u00e1r, or slightly elevated table which occupies the centre of the district. Except on the edge of the rivers, which are fringed with a jungle now rapidly disappearing, the whole of this part is under very high cultivation, and the soil is the finest loam. The violent and capricious stream of the R\u00e1pti has along the north-eastern frontier scooped out from time to time a number of deep beds, which it has since deserted leaving long narrow ponds. One or two of these have islands in the centre and present a very remarkable phenomenon. Every bush on them during the cold season is covered so as to hide the foliage with countless swarms of cormorants, cranes of various kinds, and other aquatic fowl. On the discharge of a gun they rise with a deafening clangour cloud after cloud sweeping round and finally crossing to the other bank of the R\u00e1pti. What the special attraction may be I have not been able to ascertain, but I have never seen anything to compare with the spectacle in other parts of Oudh. The small streams which flow into the R\u00e1pti are well stocked with fish, and all along their banks may be seen the hurdle huts of the fishing classes who hang the produce of their sport along lines to dry in the sun, and finally carry it to the north to barter with the hillmen, who have as strong an appetite for stinking fish as we have for well-kept venison. The neighbourhood of these manufactoryes may be detected at some distance by the pestiferous stench and swarms of flies. Along the river banks the jungles are full of spotted deer, wild pig, and nil-g\u00e1\u00e9, and an occasional panther haunts the cane-brakes.\n\n* Should be Atardhani.\n\u2020 By Mr. W. C. Benott, C.S., Assistant Commissioner.\nat the edge of the Kuw\u00e1na. The plains by the R\u00e1pti maintain a few black antelope, and are covered during the cold season with swarms of the small hill pigeon and ortolan. Wild fowl and geese occur in every jhil and in great numbers.\n\nExcepting sheep there are no strains of domestic animals; horses and cattle are almost invariably imported, and are said to degenerate in the second or third generation if allowed to breed on the spot. Of the total area of 126,438 acres, 10,836 were found completely isolated jungle at the first summary settlement, and divided in twelve grants between as many Government grantees. These have not yet been assessed for the land revenue, and the cultivation is still in its infancy. Of the remainder 74,957 acres or 64\u00bd per cent. are under cultivation. Rabi covers 44,180, and the autumn and winter crops 47,350 acres, while 25 per cent. of the cultivated area is under double harvest. Irrigation where wanted is generally done from natural ponds of which 1,231 water 12,582 acres, whereas only 4,791 acres are indebted to the 597 brick and 158 mud wells. Water is always quite near the surface being at its greatest depth of about 15 feet along the southern boundary.\n\nThe settlement returns show a total of 9,363 separate holdings and 11,549 ploughs, giving an average of little more than eight acres to the cultivator and between six and seven to each plough. The principal crop\u2014which if it does not cover the greatest area is of the most pressing importance to both cultivator and proprietor\u2014is the winter rice, which is sown in the end of June, transplanted in the last fortnight of August, and cut in the end of November, and beginning of December. Taking very little seed (one maund under favourable circumstances will suffice for four standard bighas) it returns a very heavy crop, and from measurements made by myself, I should say that 15 maunds to the bigha was not above an average outturn. A further advantage is that the rice is of exceptionally fine quality, and commands a higher price in the market than the kinds cut in September. Almost the whole of this crop is exported, and the proceeds go to pay the Government revenue. It covers 13,799 acres, while autumn rice, sown at the same time and cut in September, occupies the larger area of 25,532 acres. The latter kinds are also largely exported, but much is also kept for local consumption. There is no other autumn crop of any importance. Urd or mosh and kodo come next with areas of about 3,000 acres each. In the winter, shortly after Christmas, l\u00e1hi, a kind of mustard of which oil is made, is harvested. It only covers 1,860 acres, but the large outturn in proportion to the seed, and the high price it commands, make this too very valuable to the rent payer. In the spring the centre of the pargana grows very fine wheat, while the edge of the jungle, still rich with its unexhausted deposit of leaf mould, yields the most superb grain and arhar crops that I have ever seen. The areas under the different spring crops are as follows:\n\n| Wheat | Gram. | Peas. | Alai. | Barley. | Arhar. |\n|-------|-------|-------|-------|--------|--------|\n| 10,425 | 13,263 | 2,885 | 2,880 | 4,720 | 3,120 |\nThe chief locale for peas and barley is the heavy loam, often submerged by floods along the banks of the R\u00e1pti.\n\nThe Government land revenue in 1797 A.D. stood at Rs. 35,590, and three years later at Rs. 30,974; from this time it rose gradually but steadily to Rs. 64,528 in 1826; Rs. 71,858 in 1836; Rs. 89,859 in 1842; and Rs. 94,242 in 1843 A.D. This was the highest point ever attained under the native government, and from that year till annexation the highest demands were Rs. 71,020 in 1846 and Rs. 67,276 in 1848 A.D. For the remaining years the collections ranged within a few thousands on one side or the other of Rs. 60,000. In the last few years of native rule the western parts of the pargana were regularly harried by predatory bands from the neighbouring pargana of Balr\u00e1mpur, and when we took over the Government we found the demand at Rs. 50,781. A native staff was sent out to make a summary assessment, and returned the area under cultivation at 28,440 acres, with an admitted rent of Rs. 73,938, giving an average rent of Rs. 2-8-6 to the acre. Allowing for misrepresentations the Government demand was fixed at Rs. 43,965, or 50 per cent. of the assumed rents, giving an average revenue rate per acre of Re. 1-8-5. In 1870 A.D., when the pargana was resurveyed, it was found that in the fifteen years of peaceful government the cultivated area had increased by the surprising proportion of 153 per cent. Much of the land newly brought under cultivation was paying very low rents and much more none at all, and it was not thought judicious to take the full increase in the land revenue at once, so a progressive demand was proposed amounting in the final year of increase to Rs. 1,15,745, a rise of 163 per cent. on the summary assessment, giving a rate of Re. 1-8-8 per acre of cultivation, and Re. 1-2-6 per acre of assessable area. The rise was distributed as follows:\n\n| Year | Rent |\n|------|------|\n| 1872-73 | Rs. 98,855 |\n| 1877-78 | Rs. 107,085 |\n| 1879-80 | Rs. 108,710 |\n| 1882-83 | Rs. 15,745 |\n\nThe following table of the prices of agricultural produce was compiled from village papers produced by claimants to proprietary rights, and from the old accounts of the chief local grain merchants; rents were always taken nominally in kind. A servant of the landlord used to go out and divide the crops, and often instead of taking the actual grain heap converted it into money at the ordinary price in the neighbourhood, and received the value in money from the headman of the village. These accounts are exceedingly common, and of unquestionable authority in determining what the real price of grain was. I have not been able to procure them for every year, but they were produced in sufficient numbers to enable me to strike a fairly trustworthy average. The table shows the number of pounds avoirdupois sold for the rupee, not in the bazar, but what is a very different thing at the village threshing floor:\n\n| Crop | Average price | Highest | Lowest | Average | Highest | Lowest |\n|------|---------------|---------|--------|---------|---------|--------|\n| Wheat | 1800-1830 | 102 | 90 | 204 | 47 | 70 | 94 | 43 |\n| Rice | 1830-1857 | 145 | 130 | 204 | 78 | 116 | 152 | 65 |\n| Gram | 1857-1871 | 148 | 116 | 290 | 58 | 108 | 145 | 58 |\n| Kodo | 1871-1871 | 204 | 145 | 310 | 116 | 147 | 182 | 180 |\n| L\u00e1hi | 1871-1871 | 87 | 80 | 160 | 50 | 50 | 80 | 36 |\nThe pargana is intersected by three unmetalled roads, one running from Materia Gh\u00e1t through Utraula to Balr\u00e1mpur, which is in fair order to the west of Utraula, but to the east of that town passes through low country, and is regularly swept away every rains. Carts have to go a circle of miles to avoid the swamp which is left, nor will it be passable till a few thousand rupees have been spent in making bridges and culverts. The other two connect Utraula with Gonda and Nawabganj, and the latter is especially important as the main channel of the great rice trade of the Tar\u00e1i. A rough and very difficult cart track continues it to the Pipra Gh\u00e1t on the R\u00e1pti, half way between Utraula and Tulsipur. The chief bazars are at Utraula itself, Chamr\u00fapur, and B\u00e1nk, and the latter village contains a small sugar manufactory. The trade is simply a retail one in grain, pots, and pans and coarse cloths, and requires no detailed description. A great quantity of rice and oil seed is exported to the Nawabganj market and exchanged against coarse cloths, salt, and coined silver. No mineral products of any importance are known, but kankar is quarried in considerable quantities along the banks of the Suw\u00e1wan.\n\nThe population by the census return was 72,464, giving an average of 367 to the square mile. The settlement returns almost exactly agree with this, showing a population of 69,830 for the 116,845 acres of assessed area excluding the grants. These are distributed in 266 revenue paying villages and 12 grants. The census returns show only 290 outlying hamlets and 30 isolated houses, but as they were taken before the revenue survey, the settlement returns, which show 684 hamlets and outlying houses, are perhaps more trustworthy. The Muhammadans, of whom the greater number are either Path\u00e1ns or recent converts, number 20,077, or the high proportion of nearly 28 per cent. of the whole population. The percentage of males to females is 91\u00b73 among Hindus and 92\u00b78 among Muhammadans. There is not the slightest suspicion of the practice of infanticide. The most numerous Hindu castes are of the working classes\u2014Kurmis, Ahirs, and Koris, who number respectively 6,597, 8,586, and 6,302 souls. At the time of the census there were 2,866 Bhars; but this singular caste never remain long in one spot, and will disappear as soon as the jungle is cleared, and full rents are demanded. Utraula is fortunate in owning only 3,023 Brahmins and 625 Chhattris, and it is obvious that the Path\u00e1n r\u00fajas did not care to encourage classes which prefer to consume rather than to pay rents. There are a few monasteries of Gosh\u00e1\u00fas, who though scanty in numbers are almost invariably well to do, and are among the largest village proprietors and dealers in gold, jewels, and asaf\u00e9tida. Occasional bands of wandering Nats, Siy\u00e1r-khaww\u00e1s, Khas-bandhi\u00e1s, and Qalandars, and other varieties of gipsy are to be met with, but the English rule is not favourable to their existence, and they are not nearly so numerous as they used to be.\n\nThe early history of this pargana is an absolute blank, though a few remains of ancient forts attest an extinct civilization, and the village divisions and most of the names are almost certainly older than the local Muslim conquest. The first of the present family of r\u00fajas was Ali Khan, a member of the widely spread K\u00e1nkar clan, who, like all Afgh\u00e1ns, claim descent from Kh\u00e1lid, son of W\u00e1lid, the uncle of the Prophet. He first\nappears as accompanying Humayun in his expedition to Gujar\u00e1t, where he incurred the displeasure of his sovereign by conniving at the escape of a raja of Bikanere from his beleaguered fort. Being threatened with execution he openly cast off his allegiance, and joined the old Afgh\u00e1n party which for a time drove the house of Taimur from India. For some years after the expulsion of Humayun he seems to have led an unsettled life at the head of a band of predatory horse, and finally occupied the r\u0101j of Nagar in Basti, having defeated the chieftain, a Gautam Chhattri. He was not destined long to enjoy his conquest, and after a ten years' usurpation was forced to fly before a rising of the Hindus, headed by a son of the late r\u0101ja. He next attacked Utraula, which was then a semi-independent principality, governed by a Rajput named Uttara Kunwar, of whose family and tribe tradition is wholly silent. The town, with its large brick fortress, on the ruins of which the present r\u0101ja's house is built, and four outlying defences, facing each point of the compass, proved too strong for his force, which must have consisted almost entirely of cavalry, and he formed a permanent camp at Chitar P\u0101ra, a village about two miles to the south-east of Utraula. Here he remained two years, plundering the country and doing his best to blockade the Hindus shut up in the fort. Uttara Kunwar's position at last became intolerable, and he led out his garrison to do battle with the invaders. The final engagement which took place to the west of the city, where the Gonda road now passes, through a large grove of mangoes, resulted in his utter defeat and death, and in 1552 A.D., two years before the return from Kabul of the enemy of his race, Ali Khan found himself in undisputed possession of the r\u0101j, which is still held by his descendants. To pay revenue was naturally distasteful to him and particularly when the Mughal was lord, so he kept himself aloof from the new court, absolutely refusing to recognize its authority. For some time the more pressing necessities which occupied young Akbar, the distance of Utraula from the seat of empire, and its forest fastnesses, served to protect him; but in 1571 A.D. the power of the rising dynasty could no longer be disputed, and Shekhan Khan, the only son of the old freebooter, determined to save his inheritance at his father's expense. The imperial subahdar of Oudh accepted his submission, and put him at the head of a sufficient force, on the understanding that he would prove his loyalty by bringing in his father's head. The old man marched out to meet him, and the unnatural battle was fought at Sar\u0101e in pargana Sadullahnagar. Shekhan Khan was victorious, and true to his word of honour, had his father's head cut off and embalmed, and hastened to present it in person at Delhi, where it for some time formed a conspicuous ornament of the Ajmer gate. His services were rewarded with the sounding titles of Shri Khan Azam Masnad Ali, and he was after a time allowed to return to Utraula with his father's head, and a farm\u0101n conveying him the samindari of the pargana. He discharged the claims of filial duty by raising a handsome tomb over the long suffering remains of his parent, whom he joined after an uneventful reign of twenty years. His successor D\u0101d\u0101 Khan was a man of war, and a quarrel about the possession of a noted courtezan gave him an occasion for attacking Janw\u0101r, lord of Bhinga. It is said that he was so powerful an archer that an arrow which he shot into the gateway of the Bhinga fort defied all efforts to extract it, and it remained a trophy of his prowess.\ntill Mend\u00fa Khan, a General of the Begam of Oudh, had it dug out during the late mutiny.\n\nOf his two sons, Al\u00e1wal Khan was the eldest, but he preferred sport and fighting to peaceful rule, and gratified both tastes by wresting the forests of B\u00farhap\u00e1ra from the Kalhans r\u00e1jas of Babhnip\u00e1ir. Adam Khan, the younger brother, remained at Utraula, and exchanged the old title of Malik, which had hitherto been borne by his ancestors, for the more sounding one of r\u00e1ja. R\u00e1ja Salem Khan succeeded his father in 1659 A.D., and during his long reign of forty-seven years raised the Utraula house to the zenith of its power. His descendants boast that his alliance was secured by his marriage with a daughter of the great Chhattri family of Ikauna, and the services he rendered to the r\u00e1jas of Gonda in their disputes with the Kalhans of Guw\u00e1r\u00edch were recognized by the concession to his standard and camel drums of the first place in the joint armies, while the ensign of Gonda, and his drums mounted on horseback, followed after. He was further held entitled to an honorary allowance of Rs. 151 for every day that he stayed in Gonda territory. The end of his life was embittered by domestic dissensions, and after having quelled the rebellion of his nephew, Bah\u00e1dur Khan, in B\u00farhap\u00e1ra, he was put in peril of his life by the unnatural conduct of his sons. Feeling that he had not much longer to live, he proclaimed the eldest, Fateh Khan, as his successor, and was proceeding to provide for the remaining three\u2014Pah\u00e1r Khan, Rahmat Khan, and Mub\u00edrak Khan\u2014in the usual manner, by the rent-free assignment of a few villages. This they declined to accept, claiming each an equal share in the patrimony with their elder brother, and they warned their father of what might possibly be the result to himself of undue obstinacy, by murdering Nil Kanth, the most trusted of his servants. The r\u00e1ja was convinced, and secured peace by dividing Utraula into five equal shares, one for each of his sons, and one for himself. The claims of a child of his old age, Gh\u00e1l\u00edb Khan, do not seem to have recommended themselves with equal force to the mutinous brothers, and he was provided for by the allowance of five villages only. B\u00farhap\u00e1ra, as the separate heritage of the elder branch of the family, was left out of the division, and some notion may be gathered of the state of the rest of the r\u00e1j, which included the present parganas of Utraula and Sadullahnagar, by the fact that its rent was assumed to be 29,70,555 d\u00e1sas or Rs. 74,264. R\u00e1ja Darshan Singh's assessment of the same area for 1843 A.D. was Rs. 1,17,525, and the late revised demand at half assets has risen to more than a hundred and seventy thousand rupees. Of the four sons of Salem Khan only Pah\u00e1r Khan and Mub\u00edrak Khan left offspring, and the shares of Fateh Khan and Rahmat Khan, as well as the villages reserved for himself by the old r\u00e1ja, reverted to the head of the family in whose possession they remained, at any rate nominally, till annexation. Pah\u00e1r Khan was engaged more than once in boundary disputes with his Janw\u00e1r neighbours, and as they do not mention them in their annals, it is possible that the victory claimed by the Path\u00e1ns had some foundation in fact. Pah\u00e1r Khan's son, Purd\u00edl Khan, died leaving only an infant son, who subsequently became R\u00e1ja Tarbiat Khan, but in the meantime affairs were conducted by his elder cousins, Mah\u00e1b\u00e1t and afterwards Dil\u00e1war Khan. The latter joined the great R\u00e1ja Datt Singh\nof Gonda in his war with the R\u00e1ja of B\u00e1nsi, and contributed considerably to his success. After several battles the R\u00e1ja of B\u00e1nsi was completely defeated, and acknowledged the R\u00e9pti and Suw\u00e1wan rivers as the boundary between his territories and Utraula. Two drums and the gates of the B\u00e1nsi fort were carried as trophies to Gonda, and a horse-drum was kept at Utraula.\n\nTarbiat Khan was very nearly embroiled with his old ally by the turbulence of one of his subjects, Ghul\u00e1m Ali Khan, a Path\u00e1n of Sadullahnagar, who collected a band of congenial spirits and harried the neighbouring villages of Gonda, driving their cattle off into the jungles of the Bis\u00fahi. The offended r\u00e1ja asked Tarbiat Khan to bring the robber to justice, but the request was not attended to, and the Bisens marched in force into Sadullahnagar. They were at once joined by the soldiers of Tarbiat Khan, who never had any serious intention of opposing his powerful neighbour, and Ghul\u00e1m Ali was compelled to restore the stolen property. Spared for the time he eventually met with a terrible fate; for resuming in the time of Sadullah Khan his old practices, he was apprehended and dropped alive into an old dry well just outside the r\u00e1ja's gateway, where he was left to die of hunger, the sweepings of the city being emptied on his head every morning. Sadullah Khan, who succeeded his father Tarbiat Khan, was a man of some learning, but of weak character, and quite unfit for the difficult position in which he was placed. His people were ground down by the exactions of a Lucknow official, Khw\u00e1ja Ain-ul-Haq, and the exhausted pargana was visited in 1733 A.D. by the most fearful famine that has ever been known in this district.\n\nBarley was sold at 3lbs. for the rupee, and even wealthy people subsisted on the seeds of grass and bamboos. Men still repeat the stories told to them by their grandfathers of parents devouring their children, the whole framework of society was broken up, and bands of starving peasantry wandered about the land plundering any stock of grain which might have remained. Numbers died, and numbers more left the pargana, which was almost entirely thrown out of cultivation, and has perhaps hardly yet recovered from the effects. The forest gained rapidly on the deserted villages, and became the favourite home of bands of wandering Banj\u00e1ras, who in the cold weather spread themselves for plunder and slaughter over the more populous neighbouring districts, returning for the rains to their refuge in Utraula. Added to these were a number of naked fanatics known as N\u00e1gas, who joined in large parties to subsist on the pillage of the peaceful inhabitants. The desolation was so complete, that eight years after land had to be offered at the rent of two Gorakhpuri paisa for the bigha in order to secure cultivators, and I have seen it entered in leases of villages on the banks of the Suw\u00e1wan, that the previous year's rent was remitted in consequence of the damage which herds of wild elephants, an animal now never heard of within forty miles of the spot, had done to the crops. His son, Im\u00e1m Bakhsh Khan, had acted as r\u00e1ja for many years during Sadullah Khan's lifetime, but died of cholera three months after he had actually succeeded to the dignity. As he had no children the heads of the house met, and at first offered the succession to a distant relative, M\u00e1li Khan, but as he refused the honour,\nMuhammad Niw\u00e1s Khan, a first cousin of the deceased r\u0101ja's father, was placed upon the gaddi. A drunken mad man, he was utterly unfit for the position, and the village heads were admitted to hold direct by the Lucknow officials, nor, except for a very few years, did the r\u0101jas of Utraula ever regain the collection of the revenue of their r\u0101j. Lutf Ali Khan, who succeeded his father in 1804 A.D., had to contend with the turbulent opposition of his distant cousin Kar\u00edm D\u00e1d Khan, descendant of the Mub\u00e1rak Khan who at the great division received one-fifth of the pargana. The share had been generally disregarded by succeeding chiefs, and Kar\u00edm D\u00e1d Khan proceeded to recover it by the well-known method of firing the villages, plundering the cultivators, cutting down the crops, and in fact rendering the collection of rent impossible. Caught once and imprisoned by the N\u00e1zim, his relative the r\u0101ja had compassion on him, and lending an over easy ear to his promises of future obedience, interceded for his release. The first use he made of his liberty was to carry off the wealthiest grain merchant of the Utraula bazar into the neighbouring jungles. Hunger and fear produced a handsome ransom, which enabled his captor to engage a small band of desperadoes and recommence his career of plunder. His efforts were not unsuccessful, and when, in 1831 A.D., he was surprised and cut down by a party of Government soldiers, he had put together a small estate of twelve villages, which served as a nucleus round which his surviving brother was able to collect nearly all the villages to which he conceived he had a hereditary title.\n\nAt about this time the pargana was twice invaded by the S\u00farajbansis of Amodha and the Gargbanisis from Fyzabad. The former were easily defeated, but the latter, who came in at the instigation of Raghu Bh\u00e1rthi, a Gosh\u00e1in, and large village proprietor in B\u00farhap\u00e1ra, offered a stubborn resistance. Besieged in the Baizpur fort, they managed to give their besiegers the slip, and marched direct on Utraula. The r\u0101ja pursued them, and drove them into the R\u00e1pti, cutting off the noses and ears of such as were unfortunate enough to fall into his hands. Muhammad Khan commenced his unhappy rule in 1830 A.D., and was incessantly employed in defending himself against enemies both from within and without. The old pargana chauthris at \u00c1chalpur defied him, and he burned their fort; the surviving descendants of Mub\u00e1r\u00edk Khan, in spite of all he could do, continued to recover village after village of their old share; the zamindars of Itua declined to pay him revenue, and when he sent his brother, Am\u00edr Ali Khan, to coerce them shot him; and finally he died of a broken heart when his ancestral enemy, the R\u00e1ja of Balr\u00e1mpur, surprised Utraula by a night attack, burning it to the ground, and carrying away as a trophy its r\u0101ja's Kor\u00e1n. His son, Umr\u00e1o Ali Khan, was half an idiot, with an impediment in his speech, which made his conversation almost unintelligible. He lived to see the English rule after having spent eighteen years in a wearying and monotonous border warfare with the R\u00e1ja of Balr\u00e1mpur. In the mutiny his son, Ri\u00e1sat Ali Khan, a lad of about twenty years of age, took the lead, and engaged for the whole pargana from the rebel Begam who assessed it at Rs. 82,000, and in return for his support allowed him to write down half as paid, as well as offering him a handsome share of Balr\u00e1mpur, whenever she should be in a position to get it. Both Ri\u00e1sat Ali Khan and his father died shortly after the end of the mutiny,\nand the present R\u00e1ja Mumt\u00e1z Ali Khan was a posthumous son, and is under the guardianship of the Court of Wards.\n\nAt annexation the pargana included Sadullahnagar and B\u00farhap\u00e1ra, and its area of 380 square miles was divided into the eight tappas or revenue subdivisions of\u2014\n\n1. B\u00e1nk.\n2. Haweli.\n3. Dhus D\u00e1b\u00e1r.\n4. Sanjhual.\n5. Pehar.\n6. Bhair\u00e1mpur.\n7. Sadullahnagar\n8. B\u00farhap\u00e1ra.\n\nNow in Utranla.\n\nIn consequence of the largeness of the area, and the difficulty of crossing the Kuw\u00e1na in the rains, it was thought advisable to split this up, and the last two tappas now form separate parganas.\n\nThe history would hardly be complete without a short sketch of the society, with the r\u00e1ja at its head, the village headmen, the village servants, and the cultivators.\n\nIn 1785 A.D. the r\u00e1ja's claims in the pargana were settled by the absolute grant to him in revenue-free tenure of twenty-four villages, yielding an estimated annual revenue of Rs. 4,185. Besides these, which he held till annexation, but which are now assessed for the Government demand, he was allowed one-fourth as his zamindari share of the two transit duties levied by the Lucknow officials. The first of these was the khatti, levied in the Utraula bazar on all goods, whether sold there or passing through to other markets. Each cart paid two annas, each beast of burden one anna, while cloth (each piece of which was stamped with the r\u00e1ja's seal) and brass vessels were charged an ad valorem duty of five per cent. The second was the m\u00edrbahar or Government ferry dues on the R\u00e1pti, Kuw\u00e1na, and Bis\u00fahi. The r\u00e1ja kept a gom\u00e1shta for the realization of these fees, and received a fourth of the gross collections. Besides these, in which he only took a share, there were numerous small cesses which he kept entirely to himself. To continue with, transit dues, khemt, or road cess was taken at Baibhit on the Balr\u00e1mpur and Kulh\u00fa on the Basti frontiers and at Sadullahnagar. It amounted to one anna per cart and \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) anna per beast. The low streams of the Kuw\u00e1na and Bis\u00fahi during the hot weather were crossed by faggot bridges. The contracts were let by the r\u00e1ja to the neighbouring villagers, who were allowed to take \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) anna per cart, a paisa from each beast, and as much as they could extort from foot passengers. This was called pul\u00e1hf.\n\nWood merchants had to pay 10 annas on each load of wood floating by the Materia Gh\u00e1t, besides a lump nazar\u00e1na according to their circumstances.\n\nThe boatmen at the ferries, whose charge was exclusive of the Government duty levied on passengers, had to pay a yearly nazar\u00e1na. Those at Materia Gh\u00e1t alone paid Rs. 25.\nAll merchants coming into the pargana for the purchase of hides were mulcted of a heavy nazar\u00e1na. One Dinapore Jew, whose name I can't make out, paid in one year Rs. 300.\n\nNo one might set up a spirit shop without the r\u00e1ja's leave, which was purchased at sums proportionate to the anticipated value of the trade. Six shops in Utraula paid Rs. 150 per annum.\n\nTangarahi (tang\u00e1ra an axe) was charged on the neighbouring villages of other parganas, whose inhabitants came to Utraula for wood, at fixed annual sums. Natives of the pargana were not charged for fuel, but paid 1\u00bd or 1\u00bd annas per cart-load of building wood. The owners were charged 8 annas per annum for each cart, and the same sum for each loom.\n\nIn case any one should escape paying his due share of the taxes, lump sums generally of several hundred rupees were demanded from the tradesmen in each bazar. They were compelled to appoint a chaudhri, who was responsible to the r\u00e1ja for the amount, and apportioned it among the several payers according to their ability to pay. This ingenious tax was known as subshi. At the head of the r\u00e1ja's miscellaneous dues was his bhent (feudal tribute) of Rs. 2 per annum, and Rs. 3 for nawa (first fruits) and n\u00e1chna (dancing at the holi) levied from each village. Each party to a boundary dispute paid Rs. 22 (mendi\u00e1wan) for the r\u00e1ja's decision. In ordinary suits each party bound himself to pay the r\u00e1ja a considerable fine if he lost his case.\n\nBunda was as much as could be extracted from an adulterer. It came to the ear of R\u00e9ja Sadullah Khan that S\u00e1l\u00edk, a rich Kurmi of Kirman, had formed a connexion with the wife of one of his ploughmen. He was immediately fined Rs. 27,000, and had to fly to Naip\u00e1l leaving all his property behind him in the r\u00e1ja's clutches.\n\nGay\u00e1ri denoted all property which in default of natural heirs devolved on the r\u00e1ja as escheat.\n\nIf the r\u00e1ja bought a horse or an elephant he divided the expense among the inhabitants of the pargana, and called it ghur\u00e1hi or hathi\u00e1hi, and if his fort needed repairs he levied kut\u00e1hi in the same way. If a son was born to him he demanded a general contribution under the name of kapr\u00e1hi (clothes money), and a similar levy was enacted on the occasion of the first shaving of the head of the heir apparent (m\u00fandan).\n\nFinally mourning and rejoicing (ghami, sh\u00e1di), births, deaths, and marriages among the subjects, all had their appropriate fees. It is unfair to blame native finance for want of ingenuity or comprehensiveness. For long after the establishment of the Path\u00e1n r\u00e1j the chieftains continued to collect the Government share of the produce, paying nothing but a fixed tribute to the central authority. The villages were held by communities of cultivators, and the headman received some small dues in recognition of his position, and as wages for collecting the r\u00e1ja's revenue. When the division of the pargana took place in the time of R\u00e9ja Pah\u00e1r Khan, the same state of things continued, each member of the ruling house exercising\nthe same rights in his own share, and contributing his own proportion of the Government tribute. Besides the villages held by cultivating headmen, there were a number assigned in jagir or retained in practical independence by the descendants of the old Muhammadan soldiers who had helped to establish the raja, and nothing was expected from these but that they should pay a small yearly tribute as an acknowledgement of the feudal superiority of the raja, and be ready to provide one or more horsemen to accompany their chieftain in war. Before the beginning of this century the raja had lost his hold on the pargana, and the Lucknow Government, no longer contented with taking from him a lump tribute for his entire raj, had made up its mind to collect the revenue itself from the several villages. The raja's entire profit was valued at little over Rs. 4,000 per annum, and for this he was assigned the revenue of twenty-four villages. But while he was debarred from any direct interest in the village collections, his power as suzerain remained substantially intact, and nothing illustrates more clearly how little the Muhammadan Government cared for any of the functions of sovereignty beyond the receipt of revenue. As head of the pargana, the raja still succeeded to all escheats, his sanction was necessary for all transfers of property, his feudal tribute of a few rupees a year from each village was never withheld, he was head of the clan forces in war, and in peace chief judge in its disputes; and more important than all, he retained the power of appointment to the headship of villages even after he had ceased to draw any rent from them. In fact, of all the tributes of Hindu government, he lost none but his title to the government share of the produce. The fact that the villages ceased to have any pecuniary value to him induced him to have recourse to an expedient for raising money, of which a few instances had occurred in the times of Tarbiat Khan and Dilawar Khan, but which now for the first time became extremely common.\n\nVillages had till quite lately been held almost universally on grain rents, the principles of which are elsewhere described, and when hard pressed for money, the raja would sell the complete zamindari right in the internal management of a village, with all zamindari claims in waste, wild fruits, and fisheries, with the further stipulation that instead of the old muqaddami dues, amounting generally to one-tenth, the purchaser should deduct for himself one-fourth from the government grain heap, the largest proportion ever allowed by any native government to any village proprietor. The title thus created was known as birt zamindari, and speedily became very prevalent, being the ordinary means by which the raja replenished his purse.\n\nThe purchasers paid what were for the time rather high prices, rarely giving less than Rs. 500, even for small tracts of pure jungle. Their rights were recognized by the Lucknow officials, in as far as they were confined to simple possession, but the one-fourth of the government share was never remitted, the birtia was assessed at the supposed money value of the whole of his share of the produce, and received a deduction of a fixed nankar or money allowance, apportioned to the position of the receiver, and bearing no relation whatever to the rental of the village. His position as regards the tax gatherer became in fact exactly similar\nto that of the small village proprietors in the district to the south of the Gogra. Some few birt villages were included in the small estates put together within the ten years preceding annexation by the raja and his relations. In these the terms of the original deed were nominally acted on, leases being given to the birtia at the estimated value of the net produce, and one-fourth being deducted as the birtia's right. As a matter of fact, however, the rent paid by the birtia to the taluqdar corresponded very nearly to the government demand on the village, being sometimes a little more sometimes rather less, as the demand changed with the charging officials during the term of the lease. The taluqdar's advantage lay in being better able to exact irregular cesses in his own than in villages held directly from the nizam, in his having a stronger hold on contested manorial rights, such as jungle fruit and fisheries, and what he perhaps valued more than all, in the fame of holding the villages of his ancestors and excluding from their immediate management the Lucknow officials. Another tenure was the sewa birt or cession for service. This was generally of small patches of land, but occasionally of whole villages. The grantee paid no rent, and the grant as a rule was resumable at the pleasure of the landlord, and rarely lasted beyond one life.\n\nDiffering from these was the jangaltarash\u00ed birt or cession for forest clearing. The birtia held on this rent-free for varying lengths of time, but generally for seven years. After a short further period at favourable rates, he held on the same terms as non-favoured cultivators, with this difference that, instead of the labourers expenses being first deducted, and the balance of grain divided equally between himself and his landlord, the grain was at first divided into three equal heaps, of which the landlord took one, leaving the remaining two to the birtia, who out of his share defrayed all the customary expenses. Highly manured lands in the immediate vicinity of the village site are generally held at money rents, in the rest of the village division of the grain prevails, except occasionally where a money rent is levied, not on the soil but on the ploughs; each four-bullock plough paying the landlord from Rs. 20 to 30. As a rule the grain heap forms the basis of the whole of the internal economy of the village, and the rights of the several classes of inhabitants are measured by the share in the gross produce of the land assigned to each by immemorial custom. The first great division is the hissa sarkari and the hissa raiati, the share of the landlord and the share of the cultivator, and independent of these are the dues of the various village servants, as much of the grain as is left after deducting the shares of the slave ploughmen (vide Gonda district article) and the village servants, is collected in a heap, which is then divided between the cultivator and the landlord in different proportions according to the character of the cultivation. The government share covers the whole dues of every one interested in the village of a higher rank than the cultivator himself, and theoretically, as the name indicates, belonged wholly to the government, where the Lucknow official or the local raja was regarded in that light. In practice it was subject to deductions in favour of the village headman or birtia proprietor\u2014a subject already treated of. The division is made by large baskets holding as much as two men can lift.\nWhere land has been just reclaimed from the forest nine baskets are given as the cultivator's to one as the government share. Every year one basket less goes to the cultivator till the proportion remains at two for the cultivator and one for government. Out of the government share one ser in each maund is refunded to the cultivator, and one ser set aside for the village accountant's pay. In land not under tree jungle, or where fields, after falling out of cultivation, are again brought under the plough, the cultivator's share of the produce amounts to two-thirds or three-fourths for one or two years, according to the circumstances of the case, but the ordinary division is half and half, government and cultivator taking equal shares. As has been said, the grain heap does not contain the whole produce of the land, and practically the cultivator gets one half independently of the whole of the expenses of cultivation not comprised in his own labour and that of his family. The deductions made from the total produce are of two kinds, either certain small patches of land are set aside, and the grain raised on them separately cut and stored, or, after the grain has been harvested, fixed proportions of the whole are deducted before the main division takes place. The principal of these deductions is made in favour of the slave ploughman, who takes one maund in every six before the division, and after it one ser in every maund from his master's share. These dues are known respectively as bh\u00e1t\u00e1 and ser. The carpenter is allowed one and a half local maund for each four-bullock and 30 sers for each two-bullock plough; in addition to this he selects a biswa of land from the fields of each of his employers at each harvest, and cuts and carries off the produce for his own consumption. When the grain is removed from the threshing-floor after division, fifteen sers more are handed to him from the share of each cultivator, and he is besides presented with a large armful of unthreshed ears. His dues before division are known as jaura at the carrying off of the grain pharjaggi. The local maund is equal to 14\u00bd standard sers. The blacksmith receives exactly the same dues as the carpenter, with the exception of the biswa of land, which is not given in his case.\n\nThe Ah\u00edr who tends the village cattle is remunerated on two different principles, according to the service taken from him. Ordinarily he only tends the cattle at pasture during the day time, returning them to their master's custody at night. In that case he takes one biswa of land and thirty sers of grain before division for each bullock at each harvest, and on the removal of the grain from the threshing-floor five sers pharjaggi from the cultivator's share.\n\nIt is however not uncommon for him to take entire charge of the cattle, feeding them in the hot weather, and assuming the responsibility of their safe keeping at night. He then takes a kachcha bigha (varies slightly in different villages, but is about one-third of the standard bigha) for each beast at each harvest, one and a half maund jaura before division, and fifteen sers on the removal of the grain.\n\nThe barber, the washerman, and the watchman are allowed one and a half maund before division for each four-bullock and thirty sers for each two-bullock plough.\nThe pandit, or the village astrologer, may cut one biswa of land at each harvest from the fields of each of his constituentes, besides his anjuri, or one or two double handfuls of grain from each heap.\n\nWhen the grain is removed the beggar is allowed one or more double handfuls from each heap.\n\nWhen the grain is cut the whole village joins in the work, and the labourers are repaid in the case of rice by dividing among themselves one maund out of seventeen of the gross produce after it is threshed out, but before the main division. With other crops the fattest sheaf out of thirty is set aside for them.\n\nAmong the cultivators themselves two singular customs are deserving of record:\n\nSmall bodies of cultivators hold land in common, and reproduce on a small scale many of the features of regular zamindari village communities. Thus, in the same village there will be found paying rent to the resident village proprietors three or four communities of non-proprietary cultivators, who always hold the same fields, frequently scattered over every part of the village area. Each field thus held in common is divided, according to the recognized shares of the labourers, along its whole length at the beginning of every agricultural year, and an acre will often be divided into several long strips, each not more than four or five yards broad, and marked off by tufts of dry grass stuck into the ground at intervals. To ensure fairness these strips are distributed among the cultivators by lot at the beginning of the season. It is hardly necessary to say that this splitting up of each cultivator's tenement into a number of narrow strips of land, situated in every part of the village, does not conduce to economy of labour, but it is on exactly the same principle as the division of every part of every village in an estate among the members of a co-proprietary community, and finds its origin in an instinct of equity, which demands that each sharer should participate equally in every special advantage possessed by different localities.\n\nAnother local custom is that three or four families will take a farm between them and cultivate it in common, storing the grain when cut in a common threshing-floor, after beating out and drying, division is made among the co-sharers, an equal share being taken by each male and each ox engaged in the cultivation. For instance, two families form a society of this kind\u2014one with three males and four oxen, the other with one male and two oxen. The total number of shares in the grain here is ten, of which the first family takes seven, the other three.\n\nI have hitherto refrained from saying anything about rights in waste, and I can hardly do so without giving a strong opinion on hotly contested points. In the first place I must point out the wide distinction between villages where there was no proprietary or quasi-proprietary body intervening between the cultivators and the raja, and villages held by what we call coparcenary communities of zamindars. Of the latter class it is enough to say here that the principal distinctive zamindari rights appear to me to be\nthe r\u0101ja's rights, split up by devolution between every member of a ruling clan. The former class is by far the most common in this district, and displays, I believe, the most simple and normal form of the constitution of a Hindu society. The unit of this is the r\u0101j whose boundaries usually corresponded with the revenue division known as the pargana, and the villages, though quite independent and self-contained with respect to each other, were, to use the words of Sir H. Maine, \"held together by a variety of subordinate relations to a feudal chief, single or corporate, the lord.\" This was the state of things we found at annexation; it had certainly existed for the whole period of the Path\u00e1n rule in Utraula. We find clear traces of it in the oldest extant historical records relating to the country, and if ever wholly self-contained and independent cultivating village communities existed, it was in a truly primitive time, beyond the reach of historical proof or even tradition. The oldest and latest form of native society with which we are acquainted, either contained the single lord or the tribe of ruling clansmen as an essential part of the body politic, and the only trace of anything corresponding to the mark unit, described by Maurer and Sir H. Maine which I have met, is to be found in the non-Hindu communities of Th\u00e1rf\u00e1s. The principle of association was a most complex and artificial form of commonism, in which no one could be said to have any real proprietary right in the land, but every single class has its definite share in the gross produce, the land belonging to the whole community of inhabitants in the lordship, as opposed to the inhabitants of neighbouring parganas, and jointly to the r\u0101ja and village community as opposed to neighbouring villages. Each individual class, the barber as much as the r\u0101ja, formed an essential part of the whole unit of property, and the absence of any one member would leave a share of the produce unappropriated, to which no one could advance a just claim on the ground of being proprietor of the land on which the grain was grown. It is certainly erroneous to suppose that the Hindu r\u0101ja bore the slightest resemblance to the medi\u00e6val beneficiary. Instead of being created by, he was countless centuries anterior to the Muhammadan Emperors, and if they were able to establish certain families in that position, any argument from analogy would raise a presumption that in Europe also, the courts of Charlemagne and his successors owed their stability and independence to the fact that they succeeded to an indigenous institution of chieftainship to the forms of which they naturally accommodated themselves.\n\nHence we find in Utraula facts at irreconcilable variance with the received view of village communities. Nothing could be further from the truth than to suppose that the village council was the sole tribunal. Such was undoubtedly the case with villages held by zamindari communities, but that, as I have already said, was a complex and abnormal form of society, where a ruling clan exercised corporately the rights of the feudal lord. In Utraula there was no such thing as a standing council of village elders, many disputes were settled by friendly arbitration, but the arbitrators could enforce their decision by no sanction, and the real court was the r\u0101ja's kachahri, whose orders were backed by ample force. Caste panch\u00e1yats are left out of consideration, as their jurisdiction was quite independent of village boundaries, and\nderived from another source than the local political organization. Neither do we find anything like the arable mark with its frequent redivisions according to fixed shares among the cultivating freemen. Indeed, there was no distinction between free and outside cultivators, all were equal, and though the fields under cultivation were commonly changed, they were distributed on no more regular principle than that of adaptation to the agricultural capital possessed by the several members of the community. In the same way then as the cultivated land belonged to the state, in the sense not of the government, but of the whole community, so also did the waste. Real rights in the soil were as little known in the one as in the other, and as the r\u0101ja appointed headmen, with certain rights in the government share of the grain, to whole villages, so did he, or his representative, the headman, appoint cultivators to the arable waste, with absolute right to the customary cultivator's portion of the produce. As long as the waste remained untilled, the rights in it of the different classes of the community were naturally very indefinite, but Sir H. Maine's description of what he considers a derived form of society, applies, with the exception of a few terms, to the original Utraula village. \"Waste was ancillary to the tenemental lands, the free tenants of the lord whom we may provisionally take to represent the freemen of the village community\" (read the village cultivators) \"retained\" (held) \"all their ascertained rights of pasture and firewood, but subject to all ascertained rights the waste belongs actually or potentially to the lord's domain.\" Thus we find that the villagers used to take as much wood, fish, or mahua fruit as they wanted for their own consumption from the ponds and jungles within the village boundaries, while they thatched their houses and fed their cattle free of charge from the grass lands. At the same time, any such produce as could be carried and sold beyond the limits of the village belonged to the r\u0101ja, and the proceeds formed one of the chief sources of his revenue, the s\u0101yar.\n\nIt was in accordance with this principle that when a cultivator moved to another village he ceased to have any rights in the house he left. The thatch beams and walls became the absolute property of the r\u0101ja. It was always a disputed point whether the chieftain had any right to plant new villages on the waste land of a village, in which he had created a birt tenure. The birtia's resistance was generally successful, but in 1841 A.D. the point in issue between R\u0101ja Umr o Ali Khan and the wealthy Gosh\u00e1in birtia of Magaipur was decided in favour of the former by the n\u0101zim, and the r\u0101ja carved four or five new birts from the extensive forests of that village.\n\nThe chief mercantile classes, the money-lenders, grain merchants, and spirit distillers were not included in the agricultural community, but we have seen that the r\u0101ja taxed them heavily, and when the shirakat\u00e1na, or forced contribution in times of need, was levied, they took their share in the burden with the cultivators and village headmen.\n\nUTRAULA*\u2014Pargana UTRAULA\u2014Tahsil UTRAULA\u2014District GONDA.\u2014(Latitude 27\u00b020' north, longitude 82\u00b028' east) Capital of the pargana of that name, situated three miles south of the R\u00e1pti, and a mile and a half north of\n\n* By Mr. W. C. Bennett, C.S., Assistant Commissioner.\nthe Suw\u00e1wan. One road connects it with Balr\u00e1mpur, 17 miles to the west, another with the important market of Biskohar in Basti about 30 miles due east crossing the R\u00e1pti by the Materia Gh\u00e1t. Another road, some 28 miles from Utraula, runs 32 miles to the south-west to Gonda, and another, 36 miles south, to the great mart of Nawabganj. Tulsipur, 15 miles to the north, is reached only by cart tracks crossing the R\u00e1pti at Pipra Gh\u00e1t.\n\nA rate of 6 pie per rupee on goods sold in the bazar yields the annual sum of Rs. 1,900 only; the ordinary grain, pots, and pans and coarse cloths are sold. Great quantities of rice pass through on its way to Nawabganj. The population is 5,788, of which an unusually large proportion are Muhammedans. The name signifies either the north town or Uttara's town, probably the latter. In the time of Uttra Kunwar (vide pargana article) it consisted of a large brick fort surrounded by a moat, the remains of which are still traceable, and covered by a circle of outlying forts, at distance of from one to one and a half miles. The first act of the Path\u00e1n conqueror was to dig a large oblong tank to the west of the town on the site of his final victory over Uttra Kunwar. On the edge of this and close to the road are the tombs of himself and some of his descendants in a brick building which has been rent asunder by a superb p\u00e1k\u00e1r tree. The next object to the east of the tombs is a large stone tank, sacred to Dukhra N\u00e1th Mah\u00e1deo. It was built some 80 years ago by a Balr\u00e1mpur saint, and is surrounded by the houses of two rival establishments of devotees, and by a picturesque garden and fine trees. A few paces further is the \u00e1k\u00e1ri godown, which here yields an annual revenue of about Rs. 25,000. With this the main street of Utraula commences, and runs due east for nearly three-fourths of a mile. More than half way down is the school which is frequented by some 70 or 80 pupils. A little way from the school, down an alley to the north of the main street, is the large brick house of the R\u00e1jas of Utraula. It is built on the top of the d\u00e9bris of the highest part of the ancient fort, and contains several courtyards, one of which is occupied by the tahsildar, while another serves as a temporary hospital, and a third as the residence of the boy raja and his mother. The brick work is solid and the arches pretty, but the building presents no very striking architectural features. Further east the th\u00e1na on the north of the road is confronted by the new charitable dispensary, a large masonry bungalow placed in an airy situation on the highest point in Utraula. Adjoining this is the raja's garden surrounded by a high brick wall. The sar\u00e1\u00e9 also a large brick building ends the town to the east.\n\nThe town lands are covered with magnificent groves of mango trees, and are divided in a number of small parcels among many proprietors. The chief of course being the old Path\u00e1n rulers. To the north at a distance of from 3 to 1 miles run a series of large jhills, with great quantities of duck, which however are exceedingly difficult to approach, and in places moderately good snipe shooting.\n\nYAHIA PUR\u2014Pargana PATTI\u2014Tahsil PATTI\u2014District PARTABGARH.\u2014The Sai river borders this village, which is seven miles from Partabgarh. This place was formerly in the possession of the Bhars; they killed the whole family of the q\u00e1n\u00fango except one pregnant woman who fled to\nDelhi and complained. Her son when come to years of discretion again urged the complaint. G\u016bl\u0101r S\u0101h, Dikhit Chhattri of Bisauli in B\u0101nda, was sent against the Bhars and received a grant of ten parganas. The Dikhits came to Bilkhar, conquered the Bhars, settled in Bilkhar, and in digging foundations found an idol, Bilkhar Mah\u0101deo, now a celebrated object of worship. This Bilkhar is within Yahi\u0101pur. There was a great fight in 1180 fasli (A.D. 1772) between the lord of Bilkhar, R\u0101e Meherb\u0101n Singh, and the chakladar; the former was overthrown, and his estate attached for several generations. The rest of the history is given under pargana Patt\u012b. There is a fair at the shrine attended by about 2,500 people.\n\nZAIDPUR\u2014Pargana Siddhaur\u2014Tahsil Nawabganj\u2014District Bara Banki.\u2014This town lies 14 miles east-south-east of the civil station; it is said to have been founded 400 years ago by Sayyad Zaid, the ancestor of the great Sayyad community now living there.\n\nA large manufacture of country cloth is carried on.\n\n| Population Details |\n|-------------------|\n| Total population   | 10,680 |\n| Musalmans          | 6,375 |\n| Hindus             | 4,305 |\n\nLatitude 26\u00b0 50' north\nLongitude 81\u00b0 21' 30\" east\n\nZOR\u0100WARGANJ\u2014Pargana Purwa\u2014Tahsil Purwa\u2014District Unao.\u2014This town is 6 miles north of Purwa and 23 miles east of Unao; a tank made by the founder of the town, Zor\u0101war Singh, is to be seen to the south. This man was a brother of Raj\u0101 Achal Singh Bais; in 1145 fasli (A.D. 1737) he founded this village. The site belonged to two villages, Sh\u0101hpur and Sumdaha. The soil is good and the neighbouring country well wooded and picturesque, being diversified with numerous groves. The population consists of 1,472 Hindus and 11 Musalmans. There are two markets weekly, and the annual sales are Rs. 7,650. Jewellery and shoes are made here. There are two temples to Mah\u0101deo.
