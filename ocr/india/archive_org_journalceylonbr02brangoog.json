MERVIN.\n\n(Read April 7th, 1881.)\n\nAstronomy was discovered and cultivated in the early period of the world. It spread from one country to another, and seems to have come from Chaldea to India and China.\n\nThe Rev. H. Hoisington, of the American Mission at Jaffna, in his work entitled The Oriental Astronomer, says:\u2014\"Chaldea may be considered as the cradle of astronomy. A series of observations was made at Babylon during a period of 1,903 years preceding the capture of that city by Alexander. This would carry back the origin of astronomy in Chaldea to at least 2,234 years before Christ.\"\n\n\"The Chinese possess the oldest authentic records of astronomical observations. They invented their cycle of 60 years as early as 2,900 years B.C., and they were able to predict (or calculate) the eclipses as early as 2,128 years B.C.\"\n\n\"The early part of Hindu astronomy is involved in great obscurity. The lunar mansions, or Nadchattirams, are the most ancient part of Hindu astronomy found on record. They date somewhere between the years 1528 and 1371 B.C.\"\n\n* The Society decline to be responsible for the statements of the author. The Paper is printed (in r\u00e9sum\u00e9) having been read at a General Meeting.\nTrue Hindu astronomy is very different from Hindu mythology. Some Europeans seem to think that the mythology and the astronomy of the Hindus are identical.\n\nHindu mythology is mingled with legends and exaggerations of poetry, which are utterly fantastic and absurdly false. But the true science of astronomy is found in other works which are really scientific, such as:\n\nBrahma Siddh\u00e1ntam.  \nS\u00fariya Siddh\u00e1ntam.  \nS\u00f3ma Siddh\u00e1ntam.  \nVashda Siddh\u00e1ntam.  \nR\u00f3maka Siddh\u00e1ntam.  \n\nViy\u00e1sa Siddh\u00e1ntam.  \nP\u00f3sa Siddh\u00e1ntam.  \nVar\u00e1ka Siddh\u00e1ntam.  \nA'riya Siddh\u00e1ntam  \nSiddh\u00e1nta Sir\u00f3ma\u1e47i.\n\nThere are several other works among the Hindus on astronomy, but these are the important ones.\n\nI do not pretend to say that I have read all these books. I have read only two of them, from which I will give quotations and authorities, to prove that many of the doctrines of the Hindu science do perfectly correspond with those of the European science.\n\nThe 59th verse of the 1st chapter of S\u00fariya Siddh\u00e1ntam reads as follows:\n\n\"Twice 800 y\u00f3janas are the diameter of the earth; the square root of ten times the square of that is the earth's circumference.\"\n\nHere it is plainly said that the earth's diameter is 1,600 y\u00f3janas, which at 5 miles each* will give 8,000 miles,\n\n* The measurement of the y\u00f3jana is not exactly settled. According to some authorities, it is equal to 16,000 yards; according to others, to 8,000 yards. The Chinese traveller Hieuen Thsang, who visited India in the middle of the 7th century, reports that in India, according to ancient tradition, a y\u00f3jana equalled 40 li (a li being about 550 yards). According to the customary use of the Indian kingdoms, it is 30 li. But the y\u00f3jana mentioned in the sacred books contains only 16 li; which smallest y\u00f3jana is equal to 5 English miles.\nand its circumference 25,298 miles. According to European science the diameter is 7,917 miles, and the circumference 24,856 miles, shewing a very close proximity to the Hindu calculation.\n\nAgain, the 52nd verse of the 3rd chapter of Siddh\u00e1nta Sir\u00f3ma\u1e47i reads thus:\u2014\n\n\"The circumference of the earth has been pronounced to be 4,967 y\u00f3janas, and the diameter of the same has been declared to be $1581\\frac{1}{24}$ y\u00f3janas.\"\n\nAccording to this, the diameter is $7,905\\frac{5}{4}$ miles, and the circumference 24,835 miles, which figures are very much nearer to the European than those given in S\u00fariya Siddh\u00e1nta, the difference being very insignificant.\n\nII.\u2014According to Hindu mythology, the earth is a circular, flat body, supported by the serpent \"A't\u00edch\u00e9dan,\" &c.; but the 32nd verse of the 12th chapter of S\u00fariya Siddh\u00e1n-tam says that the earth is a globe and a self-supporting body.\n\nThe same description is given in the 2nd verse of the 3rd chapter of Siddh\u00e1nta Sir\u00f3ma\u1e47i:\u2014\n\n\"This globe of the earth is perfectly round, and encompassed by the orbits of the Moon, Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn, and by the constellations. It has no (material) supporter, but stands firmly in the expanse of heaven by its own inherent force,\" &c.\n\nThe 4th verse demonstrates the self-support of the earth:\u2014\n\n\"If the earth were supported by any material substance or living creature, then that would require a second supporter; and for that second, a third would be required. Here, we have the absurdity of an interminable series. If the last of the series be supposed to remain firm by its own inherent power, then why may not the same power be supposed to exist in the first\u2014that is, in the earth?\"\nIII.\u2014According to Hindu mythology, the earth is said to be motionless, and the day and night are caused by the sun moving round the earth; but *A'riya Siddh\u00e1ntam* says that the earth moves round on its axis, and that thereby the day and night are caused. This verse of *A'riya Siddh\u00e1ntam* is quoted by Professor Colebrooke in his Essays, Vol. II., page 392.\n\nIV.\u2014The mythology states that the sun is nearer the earth than the moon; but the 2nd verse of the 3rd chapter of *Siddh\u00e1nta Sir\u00f3mani*, read before, says that the earth is encompassed by the orbits of the Moon, Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. By the order of the planets, as given here, it will be seen that the moon is nearer than the sun. The order is the very same as that given in the European science, except that the sun and the earth have been transposed.\n\nBesides, the 5th verse of the 10th chapter of the same work says that the distance of the moon from the earth is 51,566 y\u00f3janas, and that of the sun 689,377, shewing that the moon is much nearer to the earth than the sun.\n\nV.\u2014The diameter of the moon\u2019s disc is said in the 1st verse of the 4th chapter of *S\u00fariya Siddh\u00e1ntam* to be 480 y\u00f3janas or 2,400 miles, whereas according to European science it is 2,162 miles, shewing only a slight difference.\n\nVI.\u2014The common idea of the people and the poetical expression in almost all the Tamil epic poems are that the clouds go to the sea, drink its water, and then pour the rain on the earth. But a verse in *R\u00e1ku Vamsam* says: \u201cThe sun evaporates the waters and moisture of the earth, and then gives it back\u201d\u2014i.e., it rains.\n\nEuropean science is the same.\n\nVII.\u2014According to the European science, a year is caused by the earth revolving once round the sun in 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, and 48 seconds; and according to the Hindu science,\nit is caused by the sun going once through the twelve (12) signs of the zodiac in 365 days, 6 hours, 12 minutes, and 29 seconds. Whatever may be the difference in the theory, the result is almost alike in determining the length of a year, the difference being only about 24 minutes.\n\nVIII.\u2014The 2nd verse of the 4th chapter of Siddh\u00e1nta Sir\u00f3mani says: \"The atmosphere extends to the height of 12 y\u00f3janas from the earth; within this limit are the clouds, lightning, &c.\" Twelve y\u00f3janas are equal to 60 miles.\n\nEuropean science also says that the atmosphere surrounds the earth to the height of 50 or 60 miles.\n\nIX.\u2014The cause of the motion of the planets is explained in the first five verses of the 2nd chapter of S\u00fariya Siddh\u00e1ntam.\n\n(Verse 1.) \"Forms of time, of invisible shape, stationed in the zodiac (bhagana), called the conjunction (sighr\u00f3chcha), apsis (mand\u00f3chcha), and node (p\u00e1ta), are causes of the motion of the planets.\"\n\n(2.) \"The planets, attached to these beings by cords of air, are drawn away by them with the right and left hand, forward or backward according to nearness, toward their own place.\"\n\n(3.) \"A wind, moreover, called prav\u00e1ha impels them towards their own apices (uchcha); being drawn away forward and backward, they proceed by a varying motion.\"\n\n(4.) \"The so-called apex (uchcha), when in the half orbit in front of the planet, draws the planet forward; in like manner, when in the half orbit behind the planet, it draws it backward.\"\n\n(5.) \"When the planets drawn away by their apices (uchcha) move forward in their orbits, the amount of the motion so caused is called their excess (dhana); when they move backward, it is called their deficiency (r\u012bna).\"\n\nThere is some sort of agreement between European and Hindu sciences in this intricate and abstruse part of astronomy. European science says that the planets take their circular\norbits from the combined effect of their centrifugal and centripetal forces.\n\nIn the verses referred to just now the following description is given:\u2014\"The so-called apex, when in the half orbit in front of the planet, draws the planet forward; in like manner, when in the half orbit behind the planet it draws it backward. Being drawn away, forward and backward, they proceed by a varying motion.\"\n\nThe accelerated motion and retarded motion are conveyed by the terms \"sighr\u00f3chcham\" and \"mand\u00f3chcham,\" which mean respectively \"swiftness\" and \"slowness.\"\n\nThus, it will be seen that the European and Hindu sciences, although the expressions are different, agree as to the causes of the motion of planets in circular or oval orbits.\n\nX.\u2014Though the motions of planets and the figure of their orbits had been determined by Copernicus and other astronomers, yet the cause, or power, which carries them in their orbits, was unknown at that time. The discovery of this cause was made by Sir Isaac Newton.\n\nThe principle on which the planetary revolution is founded is gravitation. The laws of gravitation were known to the Hindus long before Sir Isaac Newton's time. Thus, the 6th, 7th, and 9th verses of the 3rd chapter of Siddh\u00e1nta S\u00edrom\u00e1ni state:\n\n(6th.) \"The property of attraction is inherent in the earth. By this property the earth attracts any unsupported heavy thing towards it. The thing appears falling, but it is in a state of being drawn to the earth. The ethereal expanse being equally outspread all around, where can the earth fall?\"\n\n(7th.) \"Observing the revolution of the constellations, the Buddhas thought that the earth had no support; and as no heavy body is seen stationary in the air, they asserted that the earth goes eternally downwards in space.\"\n\n(9th.) \"Observing, as you do, O Buddha, that every heavy\nbody projected into the air comes back again to, and overtakes, the earth, how can you idly maintain that the earth is falling down in space? If true, the earth being the heavier body, would perpetually gain on the higher projectile, and never be overtaken.\"\n\nB\u0101skara-\u0101\u015b\u0101riy\u0101r, the author of this work, was born in the year 1036 of S\u0101liv\u0101hana era, and composed it in the year 1072, corresponding with the year 1150 of the Christian era, or about 500 years before Sir Isaac Newton made the discovery of gravitation.\n\nXI.\u2014Now, lastly, about the Solar and Lunar Eclipses. The doctrine is the same in the European and Hindu sciences, though in Hindu mythology it is said that two serpents, called R\u0101ku and K\u0113tu, are hiding the sun and moon, and are causing the eclipses.\n\nOf all the phenomena of the heavens, it is the eclipses of the sun and moon that attract the attention of man more than any other. In early ages of antiquity eclipses were regarded as alarming prognostications of public calamities and tokens of divine displeasure.\n\nIn Mexico, during the times of eclipses, the natives fast and afflict themselves, thinking that the great spirit is in deep sufferance.\n\nSome of the Indian tribes of North America imagine that the moon has been wounded in a war.\n\nThe prevailing notion among the Hindus, which they derived from the mythological legends of poetry, is that certain serpents swallow the sun and moon, sometimes partially, and sometimes entirely. But the true Hindu science accounts for the eclipses just in the same way as European science does.\n\nS\u016brya Siddh\u0101ntam, 4th chapter, 9th verse:\u2014\"The moon is the eclipser of the sun, coming to stand underneath it like a cloud; the moon moving eastward enters the earth's shadow, and the latter (i.e., the shadow) becomes its eclipser.\"\nThis doctrine is in perfect accordance with the European. It has been shewn that in many respects there is a perfect accordance between the Hindu and European astronomy. There are discrepancies in the theory and principles as regards some points, as inculcated in the Hindu science, but in almost all cases the result of the calculations as regards the several phenomena is the same as that of European astronomy, such as the lunar and solar eclipses, the position of planets, the retrogradation in planetary motions, &c.\n\nIt is not known what instruments were used by the ancient Hindus, but it is an undoubted fact that they had the use of some sort of instruments, without which it would not be possible to make the several calculations.\n\nThe 11th chapter of Siddh\u00e1nta \u015airomani speaks of the use of certain instruments, such as armillary sphere, nodi va\u1e6daya, yashti, chanka, gha\u1e6di, circle, semi-circle, quadrant, swayam v\u00e1ha yantra, syphon, &c.\n\nTo once more quote Mr. Hoisington:\n\n\"The Egyptians, Chaldeans, Indians, and Chinese early possessed many astronomical facts, many observations of important phenomena, and many rules and methods of astronomical calculations; and it has been supposed that they had the ruins of a great system of astronomical science, which in the earliest ages of the world had been carried to a great degree of perfection, and that while the principles and explanations of the phenomena were lost, and isolated, unconnected facts, rules of calculation, and phenomena themselves remained.\"\nSCULPTURES AT HORANA.\n\nBy James G. Smithers, F.R.I.B.A.\n\n(Read April 7th, 1881.)\n\nHaving recently had occasion to visit Horana, a place distant about twelve miles inland from Panadure, I took the opportunity of inspecting some sculptured stones, which, with a few mouldings and some other fragments of an ancient building, lie half concealed by high grass and weeds behind the Government rest-house. There is nothing remarkable about the mouldings, but the sculptures are, I think, of sufficient interest, to warrant my forwarding to the Society the following short description of them.\n\nThe sculptured stones form the vertical face of the stylobate or raised platform, on which, doubtless, formerly stood a structure, of which all vestiges have entirely disappeared.\n\nThe platform (only 35 feet square) was originally about three feet high above the paved open court round about it, and was approached by a single flight of steps at the end towards the east. The court or enclosure measures 58 feet from north to south, and 56 feet from east to west. It was surrounded by a stone wall, now broken down, and was entered at the east end opposite the above mentioned flight of steps leading up to the platform. The wall of the stylobate consisted of a moulded base, a sculptured die 14 inches high, and a moulded cornice, the latter nowhere now in position. Most of the stones forming the die have been removed quite away from the spot, but the sculptures upon the few which remain differ entirely from any in the same position which have hitherto come under my notice, and are particularly interesting.\nThe subject represented is a procession, in honor probably, of some august personage who most likely figured in part of it.\n\nThe occasion must have been an important and joyous one, judging from the great length of the procession, (which, with figures under a foot high and closely following one another, must have extended more than 100 feet,) and the wild demonstrations of delight in which all who are taking part in it are indulging.\n\nUpon one stone, which measures 10 feet 6 inches in length, are nine male figures and two animals. This series commences with four dancing figures with musical instruments, followed by one who appears to be running in and out of the procession. Then comes a man leading a horse\u2014probably a led horse of the honored personage\u2014and holding an umbrella over the head of the animal; then a walking figure immediately followed by an elephant; and behind the elephant two men fencing with swords, each furnished with a shield.\n\nOn another stone measuring 4 feet 6 inches in length are five figures, all in the wildest dancing attitudes; one holds his left leg over his head with his right hand, and another flourishes a sword.\n\nOne stone, 3 feet 4 inches long, exhibits three dancing figures; and another, 3 feet long, two figures, one performing with a sword or stick which he holds with both hands.\n\nA stone measuring 6 feet 4 inches in length differs from those above described, and must, I think, have formed one of the angle stones of the course. At one end of the stone is a narrow panel, and near the other end a similar panel, each containing a seated lion, the interval between the panels being occupied by three running nondescript horned animals somewhat resembling goats. In the small space left at the extreme end of the stone beyond the small panel stands a man blowing a horn, with his face turned away from the panel and in the direction of the advancing procession, which doubtless commenced on the next stone. The\nthree horned animals occur again on another stone, and are most likely part of a similar composition to that above described.\n\nUnfortunately the whole of the sculptures are so much weather-worn and defaced, that it is very difficult to make out what some of them are intended to represent, and the details of dress, musical instruments, &c., are scarcely distinguishable. The absence of the stones which would complete the subject is much to be deplored, as well as the lamentable condition of those which remain; but the latter, even in their present state, are of so much interest, that they should certainly be preserved if possible, and the best means of doing so is to deposit them in the Colombo Museum.\n\nThe ruins at Horana have evidently been used as a quarry for some time past, and I observed that a fine carved stone doorway and other ornamental stones, which must have formed part of some ancient structure, (probably that under notice,) have been built into the walls of a Buddhist Temple, a most unsightly edifice, which has been very recently erected within 50 yards of the ruins.\nGOLD.\n\nBy Alex. C. Dixon, B. Sc. (Honors), London.\n\n(Read April 7th, 1881.)\n\nThe Island of Ceylon is referred to by Ptolemy as containing gold, and Solinus, a noted historian, makes mention of it in his works, A.D. 238. The early inhabitants of Ceylon were not ignorant of its presence. It is referred to in the Mah\u0101wanso, while during the founding of the Ruwanv\u0113li D\u0101goba at Anur\u0101dhapura there was a sudden appearance of sprouts of gold above and below the ground, and of silver in the vicinity of Adam's Peak.\n\nIt is also referred to in the Sinhalese works entitled Kada-yimpot, as being found in several localities; and the names of many places either have reference to its occurrence or to their glistening appearance resembling gold, such as Rumanevella, Ramboda (formerly Rangbod\u0101).\n\nThe Sinhalese name for gold is ran; for gold ore the term amur\u0101\u1e47, signifying not ripe or unextracted gold; while ratran refers to melted gold.\n\nIn 1854 it was found in the Maha-oya and at Nuwara Eliya, and still later again at Nuwara Eliya.\n\nThere is a great similarity between the hill regions of Ceylon and the South-East Wynaad district at the North-West base of the Neilgherries, which has recently become so prominent on account of its auriferous reefs. As to the probable age of these districts we are uncertain, but there can be no doubt that the two regions are contemporaneous, consisting of granitoid schists or gneissoid rocks, that they are highly metamorphosed, and that quartz reefs form a conspicuous feature.\n\nThe reefs are often white, occasionally somewhat brecciated, and not unfrequently bound together by haematite or limonite.\nAlthough the strike of the rock is peculiar in the Neilgherries E.N.E., yet the auriferous reefs run N.N.W., corresponding with the gneiss a little further to the North. The general run of the rocks here is N. to N.W.\n\nAs on the Wynaad, we have an absence of intrusive rock\u2014no dykes, porphyritic masses, or basalts. It has been observed that the auriferous belts are richest where micaceous and chloritic rocks occur. Strange to say, in the cuttings of the railway into our hill district, and the various cuttings on the public roads, no prominent reefs have been crossed. Probably one or more may be met with on the extension of the railway from N\u00e1walapi\u1e6diya to N\u00e1nu-oya. In several parts the country is traversed by large persistent reefs of quartz, with numerous narrow seams and veins diverging from them and often traceable into decomposed lithomargic earth. Some good examples of these are to be found in the Balangoda, Pussell\u00e1wa, Ramboda, and Dolosb\u00e1g\u00e9 districts.\n\nThe character of the vegetation in prospecting for gold is of great assistance in Australia, where each formation is characterized by distinct forms of vegetation, but in Ceylon we have no guidance, as the mountainous zone is but one formation.\n\nGold occurs in three chief forms:\n\n1.\u2014As scattered grains or nuggets in alluvial deposits, having been set free by natural causes from its matrix.\n\n2.\u2014In grains and leaves in numerous veins, chiefly quartz, still in the matrix, but not with other metals. This is called free gold.\n\n3.\u2014Associated (but not chemically combined) with numerous other metallic compounds, such as arsenides, sulphides, &c., generally classed under the term pyrites, found in veins of quartz and other rock.\n\nIn the first form, I have met with it in the alluvium of the D\u00e9duru-oya beyond Kurun\u00e9gala. The particles were exceedingly small, and other metallic matters were not uncommon.\nThis must have come from some quartz reefs further up in the hills. Its occurrence in this river is referred to in the Kadayim-pota.\n\nA second instance of its occurrence in this form was in the Galle District, where a small nugget was taken from the alluvium accumulated in one of the ravines; it weighed over 6 grains, and was associated with fragments of gems, such as sapphire, garnet, chrysoberyl, tourmaline, zircon, as well as of sulphides of some rare metals. This deposit was due to disintegration from the matrix in which they occurred originally. I followed up the ravine to its head with the expectation of finding a quartz reef from which the gold must have been dislodged, and found two small reefs crossing it. I took specimens from these and found traces of gold, but not in sufficient quantity to warrant its being worked. I have had further specimens from this reef of a much better character.\n\nIn the second form it occurs in the Ramboda district, Central Province, where several remarkable reefs strike across the valleys. In one of my tours I gathered numerous specimens of quartz of various hues, chloritic and micaceous rocks. On breaking them up and examining, I found in the quartz traces of gold, a specimen of which is on the table. I am unable to give the precise locality.\n\nIn the third form it occurs in the pyrites of the gem-pits in the Ratnapura-Rakwana districts, but only in very small quantity.\n\nFrom the little I have seen, it is my opinion that considerable quantities will yet be brought to light.\n\nSpecimens exhibited.\n\n1. Nugget of gold.\u2014Galle District.\n2. Associated Minerals of ditto.\n3. Gold in quartz.\u2014Central Province.\nSPECIMENS OF SINHALESE PROVERBS.\n\nBy Louis De Zoysa, Maha-Mudaliyar.\n\nContinued from No. 17, Vol. V. (1871-72), p. 32.\n\n(Read April 7th, 1881.)\n\n167.

He enquired of the prime minister what the lizard meant. The minister replied that the lizard wished to pay obeisance to his majesty. The king, pleased, caused a bit of gold to be tied to its neck. A few days afterwards, the king passing through the same gateway saw the lizard seated as before, but it took no notice of the king. The king again enquired of the minister why the lizard did not salute him as before. The minister replied that the lizard thought that he was now on a par with the king, as he himself wore a gold ornament, and that he was not therefore bound to pay homage.\n223.

I set myself to work at once in trying to improve the system. By the courtesy of Mr. Ferguson, the senior Editor of the \"Ceylon Observer,\" I was enabled to secure works on practical bee-keeping, and by carefully reading these I endeavoured to improve the primitive means adopted by the native apiarists, but without success. My thanks are also due to E. T. Sharpe, Esq., and R. Morris, Esq., who encouraged me much in the pursuit of my experiments by getting out for me English bee-hives and apparatus for working them.\n\nThere are four species of honey-bees in Ceylon:\u2014\n\n1.\u2014Mi\u2014Apis Indica;\n2.\u2014Danduwel\u2014Apis Florea;\n3.\u2014Bambar\u00e1\u2014Apis Dorsata; and\n4.\u2014Kana Veyiy\u00e1\u2014Trigona.\n\nThe Mi Mess\u00e1 (Apis Indica) is the common honey-bee of Ceylon, and the only species kept by natives. I have had a few colonies of these from the very beginning, and in the way of improvement I have transferred them to pots of quite a different shape from the ordinary narrow-mouthed pitchers used by natives, which required the destruction of the pot to get at the honey, thereby causing considerable destruction to bee-life. The pots I substituted are in two sections: the first section or entrance narrow-mouthed and oblong, which fits\ninto the second, which is flat and deep. When the first section, or mouth-piece with an opening of about 10 in. across, is taken up, the honey-combs are easily removed without any injury to the combs or to the bees, leaving the brood combs intact within it. Directly the honey-combs are removed the mouth-piece is again replaced, tied fast, and placed in its proper position, when all the bees return to it and begin to work as if they were never disturbed. At this critical stage, however, they are fed for a few days with jaggery and water, which is made into a thin light syrup, and placed close to the mouth of the pot in a flat vessel. In this manner I have always had a supply of honey for house use, and occasionally to spare for my friends. With regard to the English bee-hives, I have made little or no progress with them. The bees take to them easily, but it is an effort to keep them in long, as they shew a disposition to get out. By continual feeding they may be regularly established in them, and when once established they keep on and build their combs and fill the stock hive; but I have never been successful in inducing them to take to supers, which may be attributed to my want of ingenuity and experience to adapt the frames to their mode of comb-building, or to the bees preferring pots, which are I believe cooler than the boxes.\n\nThe bees are easily moved about in combs in frame boxes, and hence it is my impression that they can be by competent persons easily reared according to the European system, and with profit and advantage.\n\nThe native system of bee-keeping is very simple indeed. They invariably sweeten the pot intended to be used as a hive by fumigating it with resin, and place it in a cool elevated position, smearing the mouth of the pot with a little honey during the swarming season. The wild bees take to them without the least trouble and begin building their combs, and filling them. When the proper season comes round they break the pots, blow into them to drive the bees aside, and abstract\nall the honey as well as the brood combs; the former they retain, and the latter are thrown away, a great waste of material and reckless destruction of bee-life. When the next swarming season comes round, which is between March and April, a fresh pot is fumigated with resin, is placed in the same position for the next supply of honey, which is obtained in July or August. The largest supply the natives so obtain is about three or four bottles of liquid honey. With regard to the wild bees they always build in the crevices and hollows of rocks and trees, and, if not removed by bee-hunters in proper season, they themselves consume the produce of their labour, and abandon the empty combs and betake themselves to the woods; and it is firmly believed by the natives, that when the swarming season comes round they return to their old haunts and set to work again.\n\n2nd.\u2014Dan\u1e0duvel (Apis Florea) is an unprofitable bee, producing very little honey. It attaches its solitary semi-circular combs 9 in. by 5 in. to the branch of a tree. Its honey is esteemed by the natives as being cool and nice, but this species is not at all adapted for rearing purposes, as its produce is very scanty.\n\n3rd.\u2014Bambar\u00e1 (Apis Dorsata) is a large bee prettily marked with yellow and black, and makes a large quantity of honey varying from two to three gallons. It constructs its hive, a large thick comb about $3\\frac{1}{2}$ ft. by $2\\frac{1}{2}$ ft. in a peculiar shape, attaching it to the branches of very lofty forest trees, or securing it to the ledges of high rocks with its two ends fastened up, and having a narrow opening in the middle. It is with great difficulty got at by bee-hunters, and only by those used to such kind of work.\n\nAt the proper season three or four experienced men start on the expedition armed with knives and ropes and a quantity of straw and other materials (for smoking and burning the bees). Having reached the woods where the bees are located the hunters commence operations on a calm day. First they smoke\nout the bees by a heavy fire of straw, when the bees fly high in\nthe air in a straight line; meanwhile one of the hunters cuts\nthe hive, and lowers it down by means of a rope attached to a\nbasket, and hastens down in time to avoid being stung; his\ncompanions, who preceded him, throw the hive into the fire\ndirectly it comes down, in order to burn all the straggling bees\nin the comb, and remove away the hive at once, for the Bambara\nwhen provoked are very persistent in stinging, and the poison\nis as virulent as that of a wasp. People are known to have\nbeen stung to death by swarms of these. This is not to be\nwondered at, considering that they go to work without any\nprotection to their naked bodies. It is believed\u2014and my ex-\nperience corroborates the belief\u2014that they do not rebuild their\nhives in the same place unless a portion of the comb is left\nbehind with the queen bee uninjured. The honey of this bee is\nvery rich in flavour and highly esteemed, and is considered an\nuncommon luxury among the natives. It is not however so thick\nas the common bee honey. I have never heard of any attempts\nbeing made by natives to domesticate them like the common\nhoney bee of Ceylon; and it is my impression that any amount\nof exertion to domesticate them will prove fruitless. One of the\npeculiar characteristics of this species is that, unlike the common\nbees, they go about gathering materials for the construction of\ntheir hives only during the evening twilight, and myriads of\nthem are seen at that hour in the Mora, Kon, and other flowering\nforest trees during the season.\n\n4th.\u2014Kana Veyiy\u00e1 (a tiny bee belonging to the Trigon\u00e6),\nproduces a small quantity of honey which it makes in the\nhollows of rotten trees and crevices of rocks and dilapidated\nbuildings. I have seen and examined a great many of these\ncombs, which are irregular in shape; they never yield more than\na tea-cupful of honey, which has a rather acid taste, and is only\nused for medicinal purposes. Their combs are generally about\nfour or five inches in circumference, and the cells partially filled\nwith honey and the rest with their brood, like other honey bees, and kept separate. When interfered with or disturbed, they would buzz about one's ears and nostrils, but in other respects they are perfectly harmless and may be easily handled.\n\nSince writing the above I have been taken by surprise by Mr. Benton, a good authority on Bee Culture. His visit to Kurun\u00e9gala is for the purpose of hunting up the Bambar\u00e1 (Apis Dorsata). A narration of his valuable experience has afforded me much information, and I indulge in the hope that this will enable me to compete with my difficulties more successfully in the future.\n\nA person of Mr. Benton's acknowledged ability and experience would do much for Ceylon in opening up a branch of industry so easily conducted and yielding so large a return, but of which the natives are so lamentably ignorant.\nA SHORT ACCOUNT OF THE PRINCIPAL RELIGIOUS CEREMONIES OBSERVED BY THE KANDYANS OF CEYLON.\n\nBy C. J. R. LeMesurier, C.C.S.\n\n(Read May 7th, 1881.)\n\n1.\u2014The religious ceremonies of the Kandyans begin with that of New Year\u2014the Amurudu Mangaliya. This commences at a lucky hour, fixed by the astrologers, on the 11th of April. During the short interval that precedes it, while the old year is passing away, no food is eaten save that which has been prepared before that interval; and the people do not wash, work, spend money, or give alms. At the lucky hour (the Nekata) a gun is fired from a parapet on the walls of the temple containing the Sacred Tooth at Kandy, and the New Year begins. The customary daily ceremonies are then observed, but with more show than usual. The tom-toms are more vigorously beaten, the tenants of the temple and the priests put on their best clothes; and the services are more sumptuously performed. Milk is boiled in the main entrance to the temple, and is afterwards sprinkled over the floors. During the days of the kingdom, the king himself used to attend the opening services; but now the Diyawadana Nilame and other influential Buddhists take his place.\n\nThe offerings are much better than usual, and more neatly and extravagantly prepared. If the lucky hour is in the morning, rice and curry and sweetmeats are offered; the curry being of thirty, and the sweetmeats of thirty-two kinds. If the lucky hour falls in the evening, drinkables are presented. Besides these, it is usual for the wealthy to offer robes, fans, cloths, and other articles of value to the priesthood. At the beginning of the\nyear all Buddhists wash, and confine themselves to certain victuals prescribed by the astrologers. All work is abandoned for a certain specified time; and after the usual religious rites have been performed, the people engage in games of various descriptions. These they break off and resume at stated periods. During the intervals they pray, or have the scriptures read to them by their priests, or visit their friends, according as their fancies or opportunities dictate. The priests confine themselves for the most part to their religious duties: or they keep away from the busy world and meditate; it being considered that the New Year is a peculiarly fitting time for the exercise of this duty.\n\n2.\u2014The next in importance is the Perahera Mangalyaya, the great processional festival of the Kandyans. This festival is begun at Alutnuwara in the Badulla district on the first day after the full moon in May; and is repeated at different times in different parts of the Kandyan province. The forms in all cases are the same, though of course the magnificence of the ritual varies with the place and the means of those who engage in it. The most magnificent and complete is that at Kandy, which begins at a lucky hour on the first day after the new moon in the month of Esala (July-August). A jack tree, the stem of which is three spans in circumference, is selected beforehand for each of the four d\u00e9w\u00e1la\u2014the Kataragama, N\u00e1ta, Saman, and Pattini; and the spot where it stands is decorated and perfumed with sandal-wood, frankincense, and burnt raisins, and a lighted lamp with nine wicks is placed at the foot of the tree. At the lucky hour a procession of elephants, tom-tom beaters, and dancers proceeds to the spot; the tree is cut down by one of the tenants (the watt\u00f3rur\u00e1la) with an axe, and it is trimmed, and its end is pointed by another with an adze. It is then carried away in procession, and placed in a small hole in a square of slab rock, buried in the ground or raised on a platform in the small room at the back of the d\u00e9w\u00e1l\u00e9. It is then\ncovered with a white cloth. During the five following days the procession is augmented by as many elephants, attendants, dancers, tom-tom beaters and flags as possible; and it makes the circuit of the temple at stated periods. The processions of the several temples are then joined by one from the Dalad\u00e1 M\u00e1lig\u00e1wa (the temple of the Sacred Tooth), and together they march round the main streets of Kandy at fixed hours during the five days next ensuing. On the sixth day, and for five days more, four palanquins\u2014one for each d\u00e9w\u00e1la\u2014are added to the procession, containing the arms and dresses of the gods; and on the last day the bowl of water (presently to be explained) of the previous year, and the poles cut down on the first day of the ceremony. On the night of the fifteenth and last day, the Perah\u00e9ra is enlarged to the fullest limits which the means of the several temples will permit, and at a fixed hour, after its usual round, it starts for a ford in the river near Kandy, about three miles distant from the temple of the Sacred Tooth. The procession from the M\u00e1lig\u00e1wa, however, stops at a place called the A\u2019d\u00e1hana Maluwa in Trincomalee-street, and there awaits the return of the others. The ford is reached towards dawn, and here the procession waits until the lucky hour (generally about 5 A.M.) approaches. A few minutes before its arrival the chiefs of the four temples, accompanied by a band of attendants, walk down in Indian file under a canopy of linen and over cloths spread on the ground to the waterside. They enter a boat and are punted up the river close to the bank for some thirty yards. Then at a given signal (i.e., at the advent of the lucky hour) the four jack poles are thrown into the river by the men on shore, while each of the four chiefs, with an ornamental silver sword, cuts a circle in the water; at the same time one attendant takes up a bowl of water from the circle, and another throws away last year's supply. The boat then returns to the shore, the procession goes back to Kandy, the bowls of water are placed reverently in the several d\u00e9w\u00e1la, to remain there\nuntil the following year; and the Perahera is at an end. The next day, however, there is a grand winding up procession in the afternoon, after which the chiefs all pay their respects to the Government Agent of Kandy as the representative of the Queen.\n\n3.\u2014The Was Mangalyaya. On the day after the full moon in July, the elders of the village visit their village priest, or any other priest they may have selected, and ask him to stay with, and minister to, them for three months. They promise to give him a place of residence, to feed him and render him any service he may require during that period. The request is complied with, and a procession is organized to conduct him to the place prepared. Here he remains for the stated period. He cannot leave except under certain ceremonies; and at no time can he be absent for more than seven days. On a fixed day in October, determined on beforehand by the elders of the village and communicated to the priest, he is requested to invite a certain number of his brotherhood to the last ceremony. The number varies according to the means and generosity of the villagers. On the day named, these priests assemble and are sumptuously fed in the morning by the villagers. After the meal is over a sheet of white cloth, twenty cubits in length, is presented to the priests, who thereupon divide it into fifteen rectangular pieces, and these they join together again into the shape of a priest\u2019s robe\u2014a large rectangle, five cubits long, and four and a-half cubits broad. The object of this division and re-joining being to destroy the value of the cloth, and to carry out the rule that no priest may wear a robe of one piece. It is then taken by the dhoby of the village under a canopy to a neighbouring stream, and publicly washed; tom-toms and trumpets being sounded in the meanwhile. When washed, it is brought back to the hall where the priests are assembled, and placed in a small vessel containing the proper yellow dye. After it has remained in this a sufficient time, it\nis taken out and presented by the chief elder of the village as a common offering to the priesthood. The chief of the assembled priests thereupon puts the question, \"Who here requires a robe?\" to which all but the Was priest reply, \"We have robes already.\" Then another priest says: \"They have kept the Was priest so long here; let us give it to him.\" This is agreed to, and two other priests at once rise and chant the refrain:\u2014\n\n\"A robe has been presented to the priesthood, and we have agreed to present it to [naming the Was priest].\" One of them accordingly takes the robe, hands it round to each priest in turn, so that all may touch it, and then gives it to the Was priest. He puts it on, wet as it is, over his shoulder, makes a mark in a corner, repeats a stanza of Bana (the sacred scriptures), presses it over his other robes, and then hangs it up to dry in view of all. He is obliged to carry this robe, either on his body or in a bundle, for three months before it can be washed; and he always looks upon it with a certain degree of pride. A second robe is, however, usually presented afterwards to him; the first being considered as an offering to the priesthood in general, the second as a present to the individual priest.\n\n4.\u2014Next in order is the Keti Mangalyaya: so called because on this day the full moon and the Keti Nekata (the lucky hour) come together. It takes place on the full-moon day immediately after the termination of the previous\u2014i.e., the Was festival. On this day all the temples are brilliantly illuminated. This is done by means of small oil lamps, placed close together all round the buildings. During the night a procession of elephants, flags, tom-toms, etc., and a large number of torches, is kept up for many hours; the effect in Kandy, in conjunction with the illuminated temples, being very striking. It is customary also at this festival to make offerings of fans, robes, begging bowls, cloths, etc., to the recent Was priests.\n5.\u2014The *Aluts\u00e1l Mangalyaya*, or festival of the new rice. This festival takes place on the full-moon day in January. At the appointed hour, a large procession consisting of certain officers and the representatives of certain temples, with their attendants, elephants, etc., proceeds to the village of Gurudeniya in Lower H\u00e9w\u00e1h\u00ebta, and there receives a fixed share of the new rice and of the rice of the previous year; the villagers of Gurudeniya having originally obtained their lands from the king of Kandy on condition of devoting a certain portion of their harvests to this purpose. A fixed quantity is given to each; but as this in many cases is very small, it is seldom that all the temples and officers are represented. I however annex an interesting list (*vide* Appendix) shewing how the rice should be distributed, and during the time of the kings all the persons to whom rice was due were compelled to be present. The distribution takes place at the d\u00e9w\u00e1l\u00e9 at Gurudeniya; and in the case of temples the rice is taken home in procession and cooked on the following morning. It is then offered at the shrine, and afterwards distributed to the different priests and officers.\n\n6.\u2014*N\u00e1numura Mangalyaya*: the ceremony of purification. This is performed every Wednesday morning in every temple erected by the Kandyan kings, as follows. Some lime juice is made before the daily rice is offered, and is mixed with cuscus, sandal, and other fragrant herbs and bark. The officiating priest takes a looking-glass, and, holding it in front of the shrine, anoints the reflected image with the preparation. A vessel is held under to catch the liquor as it drops, to prevent it from falling to the ground. The liquor is then thrown away and the daily offerings are made.\n\n7.\u2014The reading of *B\u0101na*, or the sacred scriptures. This is done for the most part on the \"p\u00f3ya\" days of the month\u2014i.e., the four phases of the moon. The officiating priest, being seated on an elevated seat made for the purpose, recites passages from the Buddhist scriptures, generally from some portion of a\nPitaka* and then explains the meaning to his audience. For this service he is lodged and fed during the time of his ministry and is afterwards presented with robes, white cloths, handkerchiefs, etc., and sometimes money.\n\n8.\u2014Pirit, a ceremony to ward off evil. This is generally performed on the occasion of some epidemic, or in the case of serious illness. A large hall, called a Ba\u1e47a Ma\u1e0duwa, is prepared and decorated, and as many priests as possible are invited to take part in it, the number never being less than thirty. The floor of the hall is covered with mats, over which white cloths are spread. Cushions are placed all round for the priests, two for each, one to sit upon and the other to lean against. A low platform is erected in the middle, on which a table is placed, with two chairs on one side. This table is covered with a cloth, and the Pirit book is put upon it. A relic in the usual bell-shaped casket, called a karanduwa, is placed on a second table close by, and a bowl of water, taken from a newly-dug well in the vicinity, is put on a bench beside it. A piece of string is attached to the karanduwa and to the Pirit book, and is then carried up to a ring in the ceiling and thence down to the ground. It is of sufficient length to be held by all the priests when they are assembled, and sitting round the room; and during the ceremony they all hold it. On the appointed day the priests are brought in procession to the hall; their feet are washed at the entrance, and they are escorted to their places along stretched-out cloths. The place is consecrated and the deity is invoked, while the hall is perfumed with incense and tom-toms are beaten. An elder of the village then steps forward, and requests the priests assembled to open the Pirit, and to continue it for seven days. The priests assent, and thereupon dedicate the hall to that purpose. They then\n\n* The records of the teachings of Buddha are contained in the three Pi\u1e6dakas\u2014i.e., the S\u016btra, Vinaya, and Abhidharma Pi\u1e6daka.\nreturn for the night to the place prepared for them. At day-break next morning they re-assemble, and begin the Pirit. This is done by two of their number seating themselves at the table, and reciting the opening service of the Pirit-book; the other priests in the meantime holding their fans in front of them, and the string above described over their knees. When the invocation and one S\u00fatra* have been read, the two seat themselves by the others, and all joining in chorus recite three particular S\u00fatras: the Mangala (of festivals), the Ratana (of the means of warding off disease), and the Karaniya-metta (of the methods whereby dangers may be avoided and prosperity obtained by gods and men). When these are ended two other priests come forward, seat themselves at the table, and go on with the next S\u00fatras, while the others all retire. Every two hours the readers are relieved; and three times a day all re-assemble, and repeat in chorus the three S\u00fatras before mentioned. There is no break in the continuity, as this would mar the whole effect; and the reading continues for seven days. On the sixth night the last seven S\u00fatras in the book are read over and over again, either by twos or fours; if the latter, two more chairs are brought in and placed at the table opposite the first two. On the morning of the seventh day after the early meal, one of the priests reads the vih\u00e1ra Asne, the list of the names of the ancient temples in Ceylon and elsewhere; and then the assembled priests, with the exception of those who are reading the Pirit\u2014for the reading still goes on\u2014compose the D\u00e9w\u00e1la Patraya. This is a letter written on an ola, and addressed to the presiding deity of a neighbouring temple. It sets out the name of the d\u00e9w\u00e1l\u00e9, and invokes the deity to attend the Pirit with the other gods. This is taken in procession to the temple\u2014or, if there is no d\u00e9w\u00e1l\u00e9 in the\n\n* The S\u00fatras are a collection of the counsels of Buddha and form a portion of the three Pi\u1e6dakas.\nneighbourhood, to a b\u00f3-tree, where a god is supposed to reside, and carried by a villager, dressed to represent an angel, in many-coloured cloths and a Kandyan hat. The priests, except those who are reading, accompany the procession if desired. A portion of the water from the bowl in the hall is taken too; and this is sprinkled over any sick persons that may be met with along the way. On arrival at the d\u00e9w\u00e1le, the letter is presented, and is hung upon the wall. The procession returns; and the \"angel\" reports at the door of the hall that he has presented the letter, and that the gods have come. One of the priests blesses the gods, and the Mangala S\u00fatra is read over once, after which the A\u2019t\u00e1n\u00e1tiya S\u00fatra is read over and over again by fours till dawn. The ceremony is then at an end; and the priests are conducted back to their residence.\n\n9.\u2014G\u00f3d\u00e1na Mangalyaya: the ceremony performed for the very aged, or those who are about to die. The relations of the dying man are assembled, and offerings of different kinds are collected. These consist sometimes of cattle, sometimes of furniture, such as the bed of the sick man, sometimes of his implements of agriculture or of his trade, but more often they are merely cloths, robes, fans, etc.\n\nThe priest of the neighbouring pansala (residence of the priesthood), and any others that may be selected, are summoned and entertained; and the offerings are made to them. They read a portion of the scriptures suitable to the occasion, and bless the sick man; after which, escorted by the assembled company, they depart with their presents.\n\n10.\u2014Mataka D\u00e1na: the ceremony of conferring merit on the dead.\n\nOn the seventh day after death the priest of the neighbouring pansala is invited back, and is entertained as before. Bana is read till midnight, when he retires. In the morning after the early meal a cloth is presented to him, and he is escorted by\nthe friends and relations of the deceased to a prepared spot near the house. Here the plate and cup that had been used by the dead man are deposited; and cake and rice are put into the plate, and water is poured into the cup. A light is set up by their side, and incense is burnt; while the priest invokes the deceased in the following words: \"Take this rice, water, cake, light and fragrance, and release thyself from the condition of an evil spirit.\" At the same time he takes the cup of water and pours it on the ground. The plate and cup are washed; and the priest carries them off to his residence. The object of the ceremony is to confer merit on the departed, in whatever condition he may have been re-born.\n\n10.\u2014Ana Mangalyaya. A day is fixed, a month, forty-five days, or three months after the G\u00f3d\u00e1na; of which due notice is given. A number of priests are invited, through the priest of the neighbouring Pansala, the number varying with the means of the family; and rice, cakes, fruit, etc., are collected. The priests are brought in procession to the house, where they read the scriptures for several hours. After this, robes, begging-bowls, cups, handkerchiefs, etc., are presented to them; and a common offering, consisting of a load of vegetables, cakes, an adze, a mamoty, an axe, an arecanut-cutter, a chunam-box, and (if the deceased was an old man), a betel-pounder, is placed before them. A cloth not less than 16 cubits in length, and held at one end by the relations of the deceased, is then tied to the load, a priest holding it meanwhile near the other end. Another priest takes his seat close by; and, holding his fan in front of him, recites the following words, the people repeating them after him:\u2014\"These offerings, which have been procured by just means by us and the dead man, we offer to you, the descendants of the great Buddha, in order that we may obtain merit in the name of the deceased.\" The cloth is then rolled up and placed on the offering, and the eldest priest intones the stanza: \"As the\nrain from the sky falls on hills and mountains, rolls down the valleys, and thence to the rivers, which carry the waters to the ocean; so may the merits of this great act descend on the dead man.\u201d Upon this the remainder chime in with the prayer: \u201cIf there be anything you wish to obtain by these offerings, may you be blest with it as with the full moon.\u201d Bana is then read for about an hour; and after it a priest closes the ceremony with the words:\u2014\u201cBy these virtuous acts may you all obtain prosperity here and in the next world, and attain Nirwana at last.\u201d\n\nI was going to add a short account of the ordination and confession ceremonies of the priesthood; but my paper has run out to too great a length already. An exhaustive account of these will, however, be found in two papers contributed to the Royal Asiatic Society by Mr. J. F. Dickson in 1873 and 1875, and I need do no more here than merely refer to them.\n\nKandy, 2nd April, 1881.\n\nAPPENDIX.\n\nThe new rice (Alutsal) is distributed as follows:\n\n| Location                                      | Half Measures |\n|------------------------------------------------|---------------|\n| To the Dalad\u00e1 M\u00e1lig\u00e1wa, the temple of the Sacred Tooth | 10            |\n| Gangar\u00e1ma Vih\u00e1r\u00e9, a temple in Kandy             | 2             |\n| Kund\u00e1s\u00e1le Vih\u00e1r\u00e9, a few miles from Kandy in Lower Dumbara | 2             |\n| Degaldoruwa Vih\u00e1r\u00e9, do. do.                     | 2             |\n| N\u00e1ta D\u00e9w\u00e1l\u00e9, in Kandy                           | 4             |\n| Maha D\u00e9w\u00e1l\u00e9                                     | 4             |\n| Pattini D\u00e9w\u00e1l\u00e9                                  | 4             |\n| Kataragam D\u00e9w\u00e1l\u00e9 do.                            | 3             |\n| Ganadewi K\u00f3wila, a Hindu temple near the Post Office, Kandy | 1             |\n| Diwa Nilam\u00e9, the lay officer in charge of the Tooth Temple | 30            |\nThe four Basn\u00e1yaka Nilames, the lay officers in charge of the N\u00e1ta, Maha, Pattini, and Kataragama D\u00e9w\u00e1la ... 32\n\nThe four Kapur\u00e1ll\u00e1, the lay officiating officers of the same ... 4\n\nThe Tamb\u00f3ruk\u00e1ray\u00e1, the officer who beats the drum (tamb\u00f3ruwa) on all P\u00f3ya days, on Wednesdays, and on the four festival days, (the Awurudu, Perah\u00e9ra, Katti, and Aluts\u00e1l) ... 1\n\nThe Gurudeniya Vid\u00e1n\u00e9, the officer who supervises the cultivation of the M\u00e1lig\u00e1wa mutt\u00e9\u1e6du fields (i.e. the fields that are cultivated for the benefit of the temple only), the gathering of the crop and the storing in the granary (atuwa) ... 6\n\nThe Gurudeniya L\u00e9kama, the officer who keeps the account of the annual yield of the temple fields and of the new rice distributed ... ... ... 6\n\nThe Gurudeniya Gammah\u00e9, an assistant to the Vid\u00e1n\u00e9 ... 5\n\nThe Gurudeniya Man\u00e1r\u00e1la, the officer who measures the crop of every temple field when it is gathered, and the receipts and issues of the granary.

Spence Moss, P.W.D.\n\n(Read 7th May, 1881.)\n\nAfter treating at some length the history of the Island, he proceeds to give a sort of review of the mode of Government under \"Vimala Dharma Shriya Ada\" (whom he calls Don Juan) and a description of the Court, from which I extract as follows:\n\nThis Emperor, from fear of his own subjects, confines himself now (1604) to the mountain city of Diyatilaka, where he is surrounded by a large force of soldiers under the nobles, and by his higher officers of state; but he relies chiefly for his personal safety upon a special body guard of Moors, who keep watch continually at his chamber-door. Besides these he has many other guards, whom he selects from the best families, and who are the bravest and smartest young fellows in the country. They have long straight hair, go always bareheaded, and are generally about him wherever he goes.\n\nHis revenues are very great. Thrice a year must his subjects pay him tribute. The first he draws in March, at the time of their New Year; the second is taken from the first-fruits; and the third from a sort of offering which they make in November to the honour of their god.\n\nIn addition to these taxes every one is bound to provide for the Emperor whatever he may further require for use in his palace; and the nobles take advantage of this prerogative to practise extortion in his name wherever they think it is worth while.\n\nAll tribute and presents are covered with white cloth as a mark of respect, and are brought first to the Emperor after he has washed his\n\n* Valentyn (F.) Oud en Nieuw Oost Indien, 1724-26.\nhead and bathed at the New Year; when he shews himself publicly to the whole army assembled together for this purpose, and to the nobles also, under a salute from the whole of his artillery. After this the nobles and people come, in order, and offer him their presents of gold, silver, precious stones, arms, silk, stuffs, and cloth, besides the tribute proper, of which they then have to pay the first instalment in gold, palm wine (? arrack), oil, rice, honey, wax, iron, elephants' teeth, tobacco, or in other kind; and they then have often to remain a very long time about the Court before their gifts are accepted by the Emperor or his servants, in consequence of which great crowds are collected and commotions arise.\n\nBesides these revenues, which are fixed, he has many others which are uncertain or adventitious; as when, for instance, a man dies leaving cattle behind him, he (the Emperor) takes therefrom according to the law of the land and his own prerogative, one ox, one cow, and a pair of buffaloes, which are punctually claimed by certain officers appointed for the purpose.\n\nAt the time of the harvest in each year every one must pay to the Emperor a certain measure of corn, or rice, according to the extent of his land, which is sometimes commuted for all time by payment of a sum of money, though this latter custom is now no longer followed.\n\nThe estates of soldiers however who die in battle are free from this tax, but not otherwise.\n\nAll farmers also of the land, in addition to the prescribed grain tythe, must pay a certain sum of money; but, on the other hand, those lands are not liable which have been given to a priest or to a charity.\n\nIn olden times he had also the tolls at Kottiyar or Trincomalee, Port des Galles, and Portaloon, &c., &c., &c.\n\nAfter describing the religion of the Sinhalese he alludes to\u2014\n\nTrincomalee, which means either the hill of the three Pagodas, or of the world-famed Pagoda called the Pagoda of \"three stories.\" . . .\n\nOne of these (three temples) was appropriated to the use of the pilgrims who came thither by thousands to practise their idolatry, and of whom some in the fervour of devotion precipitated themselves\nfrom the rock into the sea and were drowned, firmly believing that this was the straightest and shortest way to come at heaven, and that the waters wherein they found their end had little less sanctity than those of the Ganges.\n\nThere is a tradition, which the writer will endeavour to obtain in its correct form, still extant in Trincomalee, that an European soldier entered and defiled by his presence the old temple on the rock, and that this soldier may now be seen by the faithful, down under the sea in the ruins of the old temple, when the priest after sacrificing holds his torch over the edge of the precipice when it is dusk or nearly dark.\n\nOf Adam's Peak, Valentyn goes on to give the following remarkable description, figuring Arangala or N\u00e1landa Peak by way of illustration. From enquiries of the old priest at Aluwihare, the writer has not been able to find any tradition of sanctity attaching to Arangala, so that Valentyn's mistake is the more remarkable:\n\nThis mountain was esteemed most sacred not only by the Sinhalese but also by all the Gentiles and heathen of India, and even by many Mahometans as their chief sanctuary. On the top of this mountain stands a beautiful Pagoda, concerning which the Sinhalese have many traditions, and where they say Buddha [whom he calls throughout \"Budhum\"], a disciple of the Apostle Thomas, dwelt. They say that he stood with one foot on this, and the other foot on a mountain near Tuticorin, and that he made so much water that thereby the Island of Ceylon was divided from the coast.\n\nFrom the same tradition they proceed to say of him that he was 26 cubits in stature.\n\nOf the same kind and size footprints of Buddha are found here and there upon the rocks in Ceylon, and also whole figures hewn out, from which many of them hold that Adam lived there; but most of them hold firmly to this, that Buddha went up to heaven from this hill (Adam's Peak), taking this account from the ascension of Christ, whereof they have obtained the tradition either through the St. Thomas' Christians or through the Portuguese.\nUp the Peak or Mount of Adam one has to climb by an iron chain, serving for the pilgrims and travellers who wish to make the ascent. This chain is made with shackles, by the help of which one can climb as if by the rungs of a ladder.\n\nOn the top of the mountain is a plain, 150 paces long and 110 broad, in the middle of which lies a stone nine palms high from the ground and twenty-two long, whereon they say the footprint is; although others testify, on the contrary, that they found there nothing but a dirty depression be-oiled by the lamps which the pilgrims leave there, who as they go down always take a little of the earth, which they consider sacred. Although many Sinhalese ascribe it [the footprint] to Buddha, Herr Baldaens states that not only they, but also the people of Siam, are in the habit of talking about Adam, and to this day shew his footprint impressed upon a stone on the summit of a mountain (of which we have spoken before), being $1\\frac{1}{2}$ ell long, $\\frac{3}{4}$ ell broad, and the sole of the foot going $\\frac{1}{2}$ ell down in the stone. It is set round the edge with silver, and there is an elegant temple built near, around which many Siamese priests and other people of the country dwell. These priests shewed a party of our people in March, 1654 . . . . . . a gold plate representing the length and breadth of the foot, on which were various figures which they said were to be seen formerly in the footprint itself, but that after the priests allowed them to be engraved on the gold they disappeared from the stone. These figures were 68 in number, and may be seen figured by Baldaens in his description of Coromandel, Vol. 154, with several other matters relating thereto.\n\nCompare the Sri P\u0101da stones engraved in Fergusson's \"History of Eastern Architecture.\" Valentyn then describes in great detail two galleries of rock-cut chambers containing figures of Buddha (\"Adam\"), and minutely specifies the dimensions of eyes, nose, mouth, head, hands, arms, fingers, nails, &c. In the lower gallery were two chambers hewn out of the cliff, and each containing one colossal figure in the usual Nirw\u0101\u1e47a attitude, with various smaller erect and sitting figures. In the upper gallery were four chambers, the largest called\nRaja Maha wih\u0101re. Then he describes a detached rock-chamber on the other side of the mountain:\n\n. . . . wherein lies a figure 9 ft. 10 in. in length, called after a certain Sinhalese woman ('Diego\u1e0da Mahage') who caused it to be made.\n\nThen again:\n\nOn the top of this mountain [which he now calls \"Mokeregalla\" otherwise called \"Adam's Peak\"] stands a white tower, which is 44 feet 3 in. in circumference, and 16 feet high. This mountain is flat on the top, and planted with several trees, and was at times sown with kurakkan. The sea can also be seen from its summit, although it is several miles distant.\n\nIt is worthy of remark, with regard to the large and small figures of the Sinhalese, that they shew the same attitudes reclining, standing, or sitting, and also the same expression, with their hands uplifted or folded and upraised fingers, as the idols of the Siamese.\n\nThe following letter from Mr. Helmont to H. E. Governor Symons gives us further light on this subject:\n\nNoble, Honourable, &c., &c., Sir,\u2014In conformity with Your Excellency's command, I reply thereto with all respect that Adam's Peak, as far as I remember, lies two days' journey from M\u00e1tara, and close by the Company's estate of Markatta. At the foot there is a large hewn chamber divided by a wall into two portions; in the one lies a huge naked figure with a yellowish body, brown eyebrows, red lips, and long ears, with the hand under the head, and the legs one above the other, called Adam by the Sinhalese; in the other a corresponding figure, of similar shape, a woman, called Eva; and I remember well that the nose of the former was measured out of curiosity in my presence, in the year 1690, by the Rev. Predicant Feico Wylsma, and found to be over a foot in length. From this cave you proceed by a flight of freestone steps, built dry without lime, up above where, on account of its steepness, you cannot go round the mountain. There is little space to walk and only to follow your guide. There are two smaller chambers: in the one Adam, with the Patriarchs, dressed as 'Baljadoors' of a heathen Pagoda, painted on the wall, and in the\nnext one Eva, with her legs crossed under her body, on a stone shelf like an altar, and an erect snake going up behind her back and over her head as if picking her brains, in the midst of her sons, of whom the eldest is discerned by his size, being the same as his mother life-size hewn out of stone. Outside there is a square shelf of which the border is inscribed with characters which no one can read, but which were explained. Near one of these small chambers one climbs up by means of a great iron chain soldered into the mountain [probably on standards, for which the sockets were seen by the writer on his recent ascent] and hewn steps, to near the top, which is reached by an ugly crevice in the following manner. Five, or six, or more blacks go up on their bellies climbing over each, other the lower one holding the upper by the legs. The topmost reaches out his hand, grasps the handle at the end of the chain, and so pulls up to the top, where there is nothing but a sham Pagoda and Devil's tree, the leaves of which are like the points of pikes. This tree shoots through a cleft in the rock an ever-flourishing root, whose sap is caught drop by drop in a chatty set near, and is considered of great value for many purposes, and held in great esteem as a cure for impotence.\n\nHe then describes the truly miraculous effect of a few drops upon women, but adds that he has not had an opportunity of observing its effect upon their virtue. It would be extremely interesting to know, whether these caves really exist, either on Adam's Peak itself or in some of the hills of the Peak range. Perhaps, if some of the gentlemen connected with the Revenue Service, of whom several are members of this Society, were to enquire from priests and headmen, some tradition would be discovered which would lead to their identification. The writer has been informed by the old priest of Aluwihare that there are rock-cut shrines at the base or half-way up Adam's Peak, that the approaches are now overgrown with jungle, and that no one dare make the ascent; that they lie on the west side. Possibly the priest has framed his answer in accordance with what he saw was the anxiously-expected answer, regardless of strict truth.\nIt would appear that the caves, or rock-hewn chambers, now used as shrines in Ceylon are not of any great antiquity as shrines from the following considerations:\n\n(1) The principal figure is in all cases the Buddha in Nirw\u0101\u1e47a.\n\n(2) The figure is of colossal size.\n\n(3) It is not of hewn stone, but of composition, and is painted and plastered.\n\n(4) The erect or sitting figures where found are mere accessories.\n\n(5) That the caves are immensely older than the figures in them is evident from the figures not being hewn in situ, but built up of chunam and brick, &c.\n\n(6) That the caves are of recent use as Buddhist shrines may be inferred from the character of the fa\u00e7ades by which they are closed in. These are plain to meanness, devoid of all attempt at decoration, being generally sun-dried brick laid in mud, rubble stone dry or in lime, or even plain mud walls.\n\nBut the writer is of opinion that these caves are of great antiquity, and have been used in past ages as refuges from floods and wild animals in the low-country, and from wild animals and hostile tribes in the hill-country. By mere difficulty of access as at Adam's Peak, Dambulla, Aluwih\u0101re and Dunumad\u0101lakanda, &c., they are eminently fitted as places of refuge; and from the commanding view which they in all cases give of the country round by which the smoke of the fire of any pursuing party by day, and the flame by night, could be readily detected, they would serve as natural forts in a primitive age.\n\nAt the caves of Aluwih\u0101re, near Mat\u00e1l\u00e9, may be seen a stone exactly similar to one discovered among some cave-dwellings in the Rhone valley, and figured by Mons. Louis Figuier in his \"L'Homme Primitif\" as a polishing stone used for polishing flint weapons.\n\nWhen by gradual civilization the forest aborigines learned to make huts without the help of Nature, and to fortify their\nhamlets in a rude way, these refuge places would naturally be adopted with the first uprising of any primitive form of natural religion as places pre-eminently fitted for the performance of worship. It has struck the writer when, in travelling in the Northern forests for miles under overarching trees, he has come upon some bald black rock, and, ascending its summit, has found a scooped-out water tank, a ruined dagoba, and a lovely view of nature, that the tank which has outlived the flimsy dry brick dagoba was in existence centuries before the religion was revealed to which the dagoba was dedicated,\u2014that the hill is the holy place of some primitive worship, probably of fire, and has been adopted by a later faith in a manner common throughout the world.\nIT is proposed to start a P\u0101li Text Society on the model of the Early English Text Society, in order to render accessible to students the rich stores of the earliest Buddhist literature now lying unedited and practically unused in the various MSS. scattered throughout the Public and University Libraries of Europe.\n\nThe Society looks forward to publishing, within a not very distant period, the whole of the texts of the P\u0101li Pitakas. Professor Faub\u00f6ll having completed the Dhammapada, is already far advanced with his edition of the J\u0101taka Book, the longest of the texts of the Sutta Pitaka; and Dr. Oldenberg has the Vinaya Pitaka well in hand. The remaining texts of the Sutta and Abhidhamma Pitakas lend themselves easily to distribution among various editors. The project has been most heartily welcomed by scholars\nthroughout Europe; and Professor Faub\u00f6ll and Dr. Oldenberg (when their present undertakings are completed), Dr. Morris, Dr. Trenckner, Dr. Thiessen, Dr. Frankfurter, Dr. Hultsch, Professor Ernst Kuhn, Professor Pischel, Dr. Edward M\u00fcller, Professor H. Jacobi, M. L\u00e9on Feer, M. Senart, Professor Kern, and Mr. Rhys Davids, have already pledged themselves to take part in the undertaking.\n\nIt is proposed to include in the Society's series those of the more important of the earlier Jain and uncanonical Buddhist texts which may be expected to throw light on the religious movement out of which the Pitakas also arose.\n\nAnalyses in English of the published Texts, Introductions to them, Catalogues of MSS., Indices, Glossaries, and Notes and Queries on early Buddhist History will appear from time to time in the Society's Publications.\n\nThe subscription to the Society will be One Guinea a year, or Five Guineas for six years, due in advance; and no charge will be made for postage.\n\nThose who wish to join in this important undertaking should at once send their subscriptions to the Honorary Secretary, as the work cannot proceed until a certain sum is in hand.\n\nThe price to Non-Subscribers will be about double the price of the subscription. All profits from the sales to Non-Subscribers will be devoted to increasing the number of volumes to Subscribers, who will receive each year more than the value of their subscriptions.\n\nProfessor Max M\u00fcller, Professor Cowell, Professor Weber, and Dr. Rost have expressed their cordial approval of the objects of the Society; other influential support is also promised; and a first list of Subscribers will shortly be issued.\nThe Committee, in submitting this proposal to your earnest consideration, ask you to fill up and return the annexed application.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI enclose a__________* for \u00a3 , s., and request you to enter my name as a Subscriber to the P\u0101li Text Society.\n\n(Signed)____________________\n\nU.

Nevill, Esq., C.C.S.\n\nIn the very complete compilation of ancient accounts of Ceylon, which Sir E. Tennent gives in the first Volume of his work on the Island, he proceeds (after giving most interesting notices of the emporium in Taprobane, or Serendib, through which the luxuries of Eastern Asia were gathered for the markets of the West) to adduce reasons, which appeared to him plausible, as to the identification of the ancient Kalah with the modern Galle.\n\nHe first clearly shows the errors into which Bertolacci and other authors had fallen, and then suggests the fresh site, in which, as I now hope to prove, he was deceived by a mere similarity of sound.\n\nIn the first place, we at once fail to trace on our S.W. coast the numerous Islands lining the shore, which form so striking a portion of the description of the earlier writers.\nAgain, the cramped and rocky creek known as Galle Harbour can scarcely be identified with the spacious 'limen' or lagoon, and tranquil inland water, which is often spoken of in connection with the emporium of Kalah.\n\nFurther, we have every reason to regard the Galle neighbourhood as of comparatively recent civilization, and possessing few ancient historical traditions, and no ancient historical remains. Neither in the extreme corner of the kingdom ever guarded for its legitimate Sovereigns by the loyal, brave, and independent mountaineers of Ruhuna, can we trace the half Tamil district of Kalah, which owned the sway of the Mah\u00e1-r\u00e1j\u00e1s of Zabedj, the Sultans of the Isles, who, as Cosmas in A.D. 550, (supported by Abou Zeyd in A.D. 900,) tells us were '\u1f10\u03bd\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03bf\u03b9 \u1f00\u03bb\u03bb\u03ae\u03bb\u03c9\u03bd' 'opposed to, or independent of, each other,' when spoken of in conjunction with the King who had the Hyacinth.\n\nIt may be well to remark here that the recurring expression 'the King who has the Hyacinth,'* scarcely refers to the great gem that was mounted on the pinnacle of a lofty d\u00e1goba, and is celebrated by the travellers to the royal city; or yet to the blue statue of Buddha described by Fa Hian, but rather means 'the King who had the country where the Hyacinth was found,' i.e. Sabaragamuwa and the adjacent Highlands, anciently included in Ruhuna.\n\nFurther, as we are told by Abou Zeyd, between the kingdom with the emporium and the Hyacinth country lies the pepper country\u2014a remark positively not applying to Galle, but at once understood, if we admit, as I hope hereafter to show is the case, that Kalah is the N.W. coast between the Arippu river (the ancient Kadamba) and the Deduru-oya; when the expression may be amplified into, between Puttalam District and the Adam's Peak District lies the plain of the Kelani river and\n\n* \"\u1f41 \u03b5\u1f30\u03c2 \u1f11\u03be\u03c9 \u03c4\u1f78\u03bd \u1f51\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03b8\u03bf\u03bd\" (Cosmas Indicopleustes)\u2014Tennent, Ceylon, Vol. I. p. 591.\nthe Mah\u00e1-oya, which through all tradition has been and still is, the 'pepper country'; or, in still conciser terms, between Kalah and Ruhuna is the M\u00e1y\u00e1-ra\u1e6da.\n\nMany other arguments might here be adduced, and some will be alluded to further on, but I think it is even already sufficiently shown that Galle was not the ancient centre of Kalah, the Tarshish of Solomon's fleets, and the rendezvous of Arabs, Persians, Indians, Syrians and Chinese.\n\nWe will now proceed to consider a number of facts, which, when aggregated, render it probable, or even certain, that the district alluded to on the N.W. coast was the great emporium of the Eastern trade\u2014the Kalah kingdom. In A.D. 50, when Claudius was Emperor at Rome, a ship sent to collect the revenues of Arabia was caught by the winds and borne to Hippuros, the bold point still known as Kutiraimalai or 'Horse Hill,' and which has from the dimmest dawn of tradition been, what it still is, the landmark of sailors, and a sacred spot at which they to this day make suitable offerings to appease winds and waters.\n\nHere the mariners were hospitably received, and after a short stay returned to Rome with an embassy from the King of that district, which, as Pliny tells us, consisted of four persons, the highest bearing the name of Rachia.\n\nCasie Chetty (Jour. A.S., Ceylon, 1848, p. 78.) has proved that Rachia is a corruption of Arachchiya, and not as Sir E. Tennent fancied, a form of R\u00e1ja, since that title was never used for persons of the rank selected for such missions.\n\nNow in this very remarkable embassy to Rome from a point of N.W. Ceylon, we have the most extraordinary confirmation of my views regarding the site of the ancient trade.\n\nFor though Pliny gives us a full account and minute description of the Ambassadors, and the details they gave of their country, yet he never even gives a hint that Hippuros was an out of the way and unknown port, but on the contrary we\nare naturally left to believe that once there, the mariners recognised the country, knew their way home, and ran no further risk.\n\nAlso had there not been regular intercourse between that port and the Red Sea, how would the Romans have found their way home? and is it likely an embassy would have been sent had it not been recognised that there was no difficulty in the relations of the two countries? On the contrary, once arrived, having recruited their strength, the sailors start off home as if on a beaten track, and without comment on their safe return, bring an embassy and presents. Further, from Pliny's silence, there can be no doubt the embassy went home, and was not condemned to a perpetual exile at Rome; and in consequence doubtless of its safe return with presents, we find another arriving in Rome, when Julian was Emperor.\n\nFifty years later still, in A.D. 110, Ptolemy gives his wonderful map taken down from the narratives of sailors, which clearly shows how well our N.W. coast was known even in its minutest details, and the course of its rivers inland.\n\nIn A.D. 410 Palladius writes, on the faith of a Theban merchant, that in the neighbourhood are a thousand islands, one group called Maniol\u00e6, and five large rivers.\n\nNow, in the boundaries assumed for Kalah we have a chain of islands recently joined and forming the Akkara-pattu of Kalpitiya, the long island of K\u00e1rat\u00edv\u00fa (no doubt then a group of detached islets), and various others scattered from Puttalam to Kutiraimalai, while on the North are Mann\u00e1r, R\u00e1messaram, and the adjacent group, parts of which are now connected by sandbanks, and form Adam's bridge; doubtless the Maniol\u00e6. Beyond these again are the islands of Jaffna, Delft and many others.\n\nBy this hypothesis the untenable supposition of Sir E. Tennent and M. Landresse, that the far distant M\u00e1ldives were referred to, is at once avoided.\nThe five rivers accurately answer to the Arippu or Kadamba river, the Kal\u00e1-oya, the Morachchikatti river near Kutiraimalai, the Mi-oya and the D\u00e9duru-oya.\n\nIn A. D. 550 Cosmas, writing the travels of Sopater, tells how on that trader's arrival at the emporium he learned that the Hyacinth was found beyond the pepper country. This, the ancient M\u00e1y\u00e1-ra\u1e6da, the Mah\u00e1wa\u1e47sa tells us was bounded on the North and South respectively by the D\u00e9duru-oya and the K\u0113lani-ga\u1e45ga, accurately enclosing and dividing the 'pepper' from the 'gem' districts and the district in which was the emporium.\n\nAgain, he says around it are a multitude of small islands containing fresh water and thickly covered with palms producing the Indian and the aromatic nuts.\n\nIn the islands now forming the Akkara-pattu as far as Kalpi\u1e6diya are abundant proofs of ancient groves of cocoanut and palmyra palms, and the latter from which palm-sugar, and a sweet paste called p\u016bnatu, is prepared, was perhaps the aromatic nut, and not the areka, which is a hill-growing species and not likely to have been valued by the Western traders. It is also of course possible the aromatic nut was not grown but imported for export, and Cosmas' informers mistaken in their statement.\n\nWith regard to the special notice of the abundance of fresh water even at this day, all visitors are surprised to find that excellent water may be got in all the islands, and the Akkara-pattu, at a foot or so in depth, while on the mainland water is extremely scarce, only obtained by deepwells and ancient tanks.\n\nSopater was presented to the King of the district in which was the emporium, who was independent of, or opposed to, the King that had the Hyacinth.\n\nIn A. D. 850 Soleyman, a trader who had made many voyages, described Adam's Peak and the district around as that which produced the gems, thus identifying the Hyacinth country of Cosmas with that part of Ruhuna.\nThe Island was then (A.D. 850) still subject to its two Kings, he tells us. When in his continuation of this work Abou Zeyd describes Ibn Wahab's voyages (Tennent's Ceylon, Vol. I., p. 587), the still water lagoons in which he so delighted, and where he spent months in coasting about, could only have been one of the lagoons either of Jaffna, Kalpitiya, or Batticaloa, \"and it is evident from the narratives of Soleyman and Ibn Wahab, that ships availing themselves of the monsoons to cross the Indian Ocean, crept along the shore to Cape Comorin, and passed close by Adam's Bridge to reach their destined ports.\"\n\nAt page 591 of the same work it is said:\u2014\"The assertion of Abou Zeyd as to the sovereignty of the Maharaja of Zabedj at Kalah, is consistent with the statement of Soleyman, that 'the Island was in subjection to two monarchs.'\"\n\nIn this we find still another strong support for our argument, since the whole N.W. coast and Jaffna has from the most ancient times been peopled by Tamils and Moors, thus accounting for the district being under the Mahar\u00e1j\u00e1s of Zabedj, who from B.C. 100 to A.D. 700 extended their empire and ruled the Malay Islands, Kalah, and Travancore; and it satisfactorily accounts for the silence preserved by the priestly annalists of the Kings who possessed the Hyacinth, as to the commercial wealth of their rivals who governed the territory in which was the great emporium.\n\nSir E. Tennent also quotes the \"Garsharsp-Namah\" of about the 10th century, in which the Mahar\u00e1j\u00e1 having requested Persian aid against the \"Shah of Serendib,\" one Baku, a fleet is sent, which lands at Kalah and obtains a signal victory over Baku; and this seems authentic, as the empire of Zabedj was then breaking up, and the Kalah Viceroy likely to seek aid from Persia, whose merchants profited so largely by its trade, and indirectly proving the old enmity between Ruhuna and Kalah, a feud at once understood as between the Tamil port and the Sinhalese capital, but not applicable to Galle.\nThis Baku may have been only a General, or he may have been the Par\u00e1krama P\u00e1\u1e47\u1e0di or B\u00e1hu, who in 1059 was Viceroy of Ruhuna according to the Mah\u00e1wa\u1e47sa, which also refers to the Solian conquest and frequent irruption of foreigners during the end of the 10th century.\n\nBaku in either case is no doubt a corrupt spelling of B\u00e1hu.\n\nStill later in 1347 Ibn Batuta visited the district where the traders went for cinnamon, and landing at a place called \u2018Batt\u0101la\u2019 (either Puttalam or some port nearer the Battala-oya) whence he crossed a river (the D\u00e9duru-oya) and reached the port of \u2018Salawat,\u2019 still called in Sinhalese by that name, a little on the Battala side of which the infidel King\u2019s territory ceased, thence turning inland he reached \u2018Kank\u0101r\u2019 (?

Its use by the Arabian in this context shows the King of Kalah was not a Buddhist, but of a religion hostile to that of the priestly annalists, who drew up the chronicles of the Kings of Anur\u00e1dhapura and Polonnaruwa, and accounts for their silence upon the flourishing port and busy commerce settled in the maritime state of\n\n* Lee\u2019s \u201cTravels of Ibn Batuta,\u201d 1829, pp. 189\u2014191.\nKalah, the point d'appui as it were of the hated Tamils, so hostile to their religion.\n\nHaving pointed out how well the site I have given corresponds with ancient descriptions, I will adduce analogies to its ancient name of Kalah, far surpassing that of 'K\u0101li' (Kalutara) and Galle; for though a more fallacious ground could not be selected as the base of an argument, yet it may be a corroborative proof of value when taken in connection with other and more direct proofs.\n\nIn the district between the Arippu-river and D\u0113duru-oya the principal river is the Kal\u0101-oya, or 'Kalah-river'\u2014the port of Kalpi\u1e6diya is still called by the natives Kalputti, i.e. 'the Kala sandbanks'\u2014the opposite point on the mainland is K\u0101rat\u012bvu, r & l being mutable, and the name signifying 'Kalah Island.'\n\nIn the commencement of this paper I have alluded to the absence of ancient historical remains, and traditions in the neighbourhood of Galle; let us see how far the proposed site is supported by such corroboration.\n\nWhen Wijaya landed and founded the historical dynasty of Ceylon, he arrived near the mouth of the M\u012b-oya at the present Put\u1e6dalam, B.C. 543.\n\nHe thence proceeded a short distance inland, where, after marrying the daughter of one of the Native Chiefs, he gradually extended his power, till from his capital of Tammanna Nuwara he acquired possession of the greater part of the Island, and ultimately became so strengthened by bands of adventurers from the coast, that he repudiated his wife and native allies, reducing many to the rank of slaves.\n\nAlthough the annalists of the Mah\u0101wans\u0101 confine the narrative to the conquerors, and have only sneers for the aborigines, the so-called Yakkhos and N\u0101gas, yet it is clear the assertion of their previous utter barbarity is quite unfounded, and we have abundant proofs that they had attained considerable civilization, although inferior to that of their Aryan invaders. Thus\nwe are told that one of their towns was called La\u00f1k\u00e1pura, and was the capital of the kingdom; hence they had a King and Chiefs under him, they had gathered into towns and were not mere savages or (as one popular idea supposes) the same as the present Rock Veddas;* also they understood jewellers' craft, since a \"throne of gems\" was an object of strife.\n\nWhere Wijaya first landed, the Princess whom he married was met near the tank, though this tank was doubtless used merely as a reservoir of water and not for irrigation; while\u2014most important\u2014here the Princess or Chieftain's daughter distributed rice to his followers, which was obtained from the shipwrecked boats of mariners. Now, had there not been considerable commerce on the shore of the lagoon, it is clear rice would not have so occurred, not from one special wreck, but from the wrecked boats, as if such were of frequent occurrence. This, too, is supported by the tradition extant (Pien-it-tien, Book LXVI.) when the Chinese travellers Hiouen-THsang and Fa-Hian heard that Wijaya had come as a merchant to the district, and there, by his tact gradually acquired royal power. I think we must deduce that the emporium of Ceylon existed as a trading station long prior to his advent.\n\nIt may be well at some length to notice the tradition as recorded by these ancient Chinese authors. Hiouen-THsang, who\u2014unlike the simple matter-of-fact Fa-Hian\u2014has always a ready ear for, and pen to record, the romantic, says the tradition was that a South Indian Princess on her way to be married, with her retinue, was waylaid by a King of the lions, and carried off captive to his mountain home, where she bore him a son and daughter. When the son attained puberty, he consulted with his mother and arranged to escape with her and his sister to her people. With this object he carefully explored the mountain paths, and at last succeeded in his plan and escaped with\n\n* S. Dir\u00e7o\u00e7t, veddo.\nhis mother and sister. The mother, however, having warned him his parentage would disgrace him in the eyes of her countrymen, they concealed the real nature of his father. Meanwhile the King-lion ravaging the neighbouring lands in search of his family, the King of the land to which the lion-son had gone was in extreme peril from him, on which the lion-son treacherously killed his own father with a dagger\u2014the father dying with forgiving love to his son.\n\nOn the \u00e9claircissement that ensued, the King deciding he must not break his pledge of reward, and also refusing to allow the parricide to remain in his territory, equipped two vessels, and in one sent off the lion-son with a retinue of men to seek his fortune, and in the other sent off a retinue of women. The history is here silent, but as the ships were sent off in this manner, each on its own course, it is only natural to suppose the lion-son's sister and mother were banished in that with a female retinue, which is said to have gone towards Persia. That which contained the lion-son and his male retinue reached \"the isle of jewels,\" and as many valuable articles of merchandize were procurable there, they settled, and after killing some of the chief merchants already settled there, married their widows and established a kingdom, calling it \"the Lion-kingdom.\"\n\nWe have only here to understand by lion, not the quadruped but a Gangetic hill chieftain, with the title of Sigha (not uncommon), and the tradition is a highly probable partial account of the origin of the Tamil coast race (which I assume to be the Yakkhos of ancient accounts) as settled in N.W. and E. Ceylon, in the country of the N\u00e1gas or aboriginal snake worshippers.\n\nThis is again supported by a passage in Upham's R\u00e1j\u00e1vali (p. 168) not hitherto connected with the above tradition. In this second legend the R\u00e1j\u00e1vali says that the Yakkhos came to Ceylon when the country was lying devastated and depopulated by the wars between R\u00e1ma and R\u00e1wana.\nIn combination we have from these traditions a very consistent story, that when the aboriginal (N\u00e1ga) race of Ceylon was weakened by the Indo-Aryan invasion perpetuated in the R\u00e1m\u00e1yana, a subsequent Tamil colony came from the South of India, established itself as Yakkhos, and was organised by an out-cast Prince of mixed Gangetic and South Indian blood, who landed at a port frequented by merchants already settled there, attracted by productions affording a lucrative trade.\n\nThis we may call the pre-Wijayan era, and accounts for the Gangetic and Br\u00e1hman Wijaya arriving at its port when the Island was inhabited by two races\u2014N\u00e1gas (snake worshippers)* and Yakkhos (probably a form of Saivites).\n\nHiouen-Thsang goes on to relate that 500 demon women, who lived in one of the towns, seduced a party of merchants who had arrived to trade, and each bore a son to her paramour. Their Queen, who seduced the chief merchant, bore a son who, after his father, whose name was Seng-kia (S\u00edgha) was called Seng-kia-lo.\n\nThe legend goes on to tell how Seng-kia-lo secretly deserted his wife after her lavish kindness: how she followed him to a neighbouring kingdom and implored him to return to her, and upbraided him with his ingratitude: how he replied she was of demon origin, justifying his repudiation: and how on her appealing to the King, he, struck with her beauty and moved with pity, took her to wife and protected her: how during the night all the inmates of the palace were murdered and mutilated, and on the next morning the refugee announced to the people that his wife was a devil, and in the night had flown to Ceylon, and fetched a party of other devils, who had killed and eaten the inmates of the palace and the King who had just married her. On this he was elected King, and proceeded at once to form an army and return to Ceylon, where he entirely conquered the Island, exterminating many of its\n\n* Note (1).\ninhabitants, and driving away the others to a neighbouring Island, and then, having destroyed their town, established a kingdom in his name \"Seng-kia-lo\" (Sinhala) to which people rapidly collected from other countries. Let us treat this as a true tradition, merely garnished by the persons who gave it to Hiouen-Thsang with the false representation that the unhappy wife was really a devil, as it suited her betrayer to represent when he effected the murder of the King, who had taken her part against him, together with the inmates of the palace.\n\nIt is scarcely surprising the Buddhist annalists omitted to record in their chronicles this horrible crime and the successful conspiracy that brought Seng-kia-lo back from India again, to the land of his birth, as a conqueror of the whole land; nor, priding themselves on their pure Gangetic race, would the Kings descended from Wijaya care to see it recorded that Wijaya was the son of a Gangetic Chief and a Yakkho Princess. On the other hand, there was absolutely no inducement for Hiouen-Thsang to invent the story, had it not been the current oral tradition.\n\nI should also here refer to the extract from the Pradipik\u00e1wa, given by Alwis at page xxv of the Introduction to his Sidat Sangar\u00e1ma, in which Gurulug\u00f3mi* quotes from the lost Atum\u00e1s (original Sinhalese commentaries on the P\u00e1li Scripture) compiled B.C. 92.\n\nHe says: \"'Since King Sinhab\u00e1hu took the Si\u1e45ha (lion) captive, he was (called) Sinhala, and his descendants were (thence also called) Sinhala,' so the name Sinhala is derived from the circumstance of the lion being taken captive by Sinhab\u00e1hu,\n\n* Gurulug\u00f3mi, the learned Thero of Aluvih\u00e1r\u00e9 (M\u00e1tal\u00e9 District), says the legend, wrote Am\u00e1watura at his sister's request for the instruction of his nephew. Said the mother:\u2014\"Brother, the dicti\u00f3n is not good; my son's style needs improving.\" Then he wrote Pradipik\u00e1wa; and yet the student of Sinhalese prose \"undefiled\" (E\u1e37u) may perhaps best study Gurulu-g\u00f3mi's earlier work.\u2014H.

With reference to the reign of Wijaya, I follow the Mah\u0101wans\u0101 in giving it as 38 years. May we not suppose the Su\u1e37u Raja Ratn\u0101kara gives it as 30 years, because the former dates his reign from his accession on his father Sinhab\u00e1hu\u2019s death, and the latter from his return from India at the head of an army to conquer the Island? The new light thrown upon the subject by the Chinese accounts renders this explanation highly probable.\nyounger brother Sumit to rule the paternal kingdom Sinhapura, established the kingdom of Lakdiva (La\u1e45k\u0101); but was succeeded by his nephew (P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0duwas D\u00e9va), son of Sumit who left Sinhapura to ascend the throne of Lakdiva.\n\nI think I can scarcely leave this part of my subject without alluding to another legend of the R\u0101j\u0101vali that is also unnecessarily regarded as an idle falsehood. This is the story that during the life of Gautama Buddha he caused a fire to break out in Ceylon which drove away the Yakkhos who had subsequently to the R\u0101ma era taken possession of the part of Ceylon, where Buddha foresaw his religion would be greatly cherished. This fire, we are told, drove the Yakkhos to the sea and to the Island of Yakgiridivayina, and by depopulating the land of these Yakkhos prepared the way for its settlement by the race destined to introduce the Buddhist cult.*\n\nLet us merely suppose that Mahinda and his disciples learned when building their temples at Anur\u0101dhapura, that a former city had existed on that spot, the inhabitants of which were driven from the country by an excessive period of heat and drought, during the life-time of Buddha himself. Can we wonder that such enthusiastic missionaries should seize the tradition, and by saying the drought and heat was a fire sent by Buddha, and not accidentally happening during his life, thus obtain a hold upon the faith of the newly-converted people and a special halo of sanctity upon their own mission? Nor in this connection must we forget the Abhayagiri monastery was itself founded on the site of an ancient temple of the former religion; and that in days before the large irrigation works were constructed there is nothing whatever forced or improbable in the tradition of such a drought.\n\n* Upham, \"Sacred and Historical Books of Ceylon,\" Vol. II., pp. 169-70.\nI think then these legends, thus connected, are all consistent, and show that after the wars of R\u00e1ma a second race, the Yakkhos, intruded in Ceylon from South India, drove out the enfeebled N\u00e1gas from the Anur\u00e1dhapura district, as they spread in from the N.W. coast and the trading ports, and were again driven back to the Coast and Islands by excessive heat and incessant drought, but subsequently, and about the Wijayan era, an Aryan race spread back again to the interior, where Wijaya's descendants formed again the city to which their Gangetic kinsmen came to preach the law of Buddha.\n\nFa-Hian naively tells us:\u2014\"This kingdom was originally uninhabited by man; only demons, genii [Yakkhos] and dragons [N\u00e1gas] dwelt there. Nevertheless, merchants of other countries trafficked with them. When the season for the traffic came, the genii and demons appeared not, but set forward their previous commodities marked with the exact price; if these suited the merchants, they paid the price and took the goods. As these traders went, and came, and sojourned, the inhabitants of other kingdoms learned that this country was very beautiful; these also came, and eventually established a great kingdom.\"\n\nFa-Hian who went to Anur\u00e1dhapura about A.D. 410 direct from To-mo-li-ti in the Ganges (the T\u00e1malitti of the Mah\u00e1-m\u00e1nya and almost on the site of Calcutta) says that he sailed thence by a trade wind to Ceylon in fourteen days and nights, (a surprisingly short time which accounts for the frequent intercourse between Ceylon and the Ganges). He took passage in one of some large vessels going on a merchant voyage to this Island. He proceeds to say that, arrived at Ceylon, \"to the right and to the left there are small islets to the number of a hundred; their distance from each other is in\n\n* Laidlay's \"Pilgrimage of Fa-Hian,\" translated from the Foe houe ki of MM. Remusat, Klaproth, and Landresse, 1848, pp. 332-3.\nsome cases 10 li, in others from 20 to 200 li; all are dependent upon the great Island.\u201d\n\nThese islets answer perfectly to the islands of Jaffna, Delft, Iranaitivu, &c., on the one side of the Straits of Mannar, and on the other to Mannar and the connected islands with K\u00e1rativu, Ipantivu, Dutch Bay, and the long peninsula of the Akkara-pattu of recent geological formation, and very likely a line of islands in A.D. 400, and the small islets of the Puttalam lagoon, and the present peninsulas opposite Negombo and Chilaw. Fa-Hian goes on to say of the islands, \u201cMany precious things and pearls are procured there.\u201d\n\nHe further says:\u2014\u201cThere is a district which produces the jewel mo-ni [a red gem probably, by the context, ruby] and which may be about 10 li square. The King sends people thither to protect it, and when they have gathered the jewels he takes three pieces out of every ten.\u201d\n\nTen li would be three miles,* and this district of red gems was possibly Nuwara Eliya, and not Sabaragamuwa.\n\nThis independent testimony of a Chinese pilgrim to Anur\u00e1dhapura, in A.D. 410, is surely convincing proof that \u201cthe large ships\u201d then traded with the North-Western coast of Ceylon as the emporium, and his account identifies the islands of the Arabian voyagers, and the King who had the hyacinth, as already quoted from their narratives.\n\nIt was not until A.D. 850, when Soleyman visited it, that we hear of any traveller actually visiting and identifying the gem district, no doubt jealously guarded as a secret monopoly by the Kings of Anur\u00e1dhapura.\n\nThe fact that former writers overlooked our islands North and South of the Straits of Mannar is not surprising,\u2014they are\n\n* Laidlay\u2019s \u201cPilgrimage of Fa-Hian,\u201d translated from the Foe koue ki of MM.

The stress laid on Sanchoniathon styling Ceylon \"the island of Rachius\" as an evident plagiarism from Pliny is to me a false argument, and the whole of his treatise on Ceylon is literally a correct account of an ancient journey from the Puttalam coast to a town near the modern Kurunegala, one of the most ancient districts of former civilization. Philo's island of Rachius may clearly be 'the Raj\u00e1's Island,' while Pliny's Rachia is 'A'rachiya,' an approximation at once perceptible. All throughout the N.W. coast of Ceylon, and as far in the interior as Anuradhapura and Kurunegala, the whole country is one continuous scene of ancient settlements. The extensive ruins of Tammann\u00e1 Nuwara near Puttalam, and the adjacent town and tank of Mah\u00e1-tabuwa are known, and a constant succession of reservoirs and hewn stones mark the site of old villages and towns.\n\nThese reservoirs are principally tanks made solely to preserve water, and not like the historical ones of the Buddhist annals as sources for\n\n* Lon,\" Vol. I, pp. 571-7.\nWe can scarcely expect, however, the trading ports of the coast to afford ruins, such as are seen on the site of the Buddhist cities of the interior, for the trading cities on the coast are said to have been singularly tolerant of all religions, and hence it is probable none were very dominant, while the King being only a Viceroy his palace would be a modest one. Now, except temples and palaces, it is well known no other buildings were built in a permanent way in ancient times, and so we must not be surprised that the trade which swept our coasts has left no very elaborate traces of its progress.\n\nAgain, perhaps I may notice as singularly illustrative of the hereditary nature of many qualities, that the villagers in the Tamil Wanni and Demala-pattu preserve to this day their characteristic hatred of any intrusion and their love of retirement. Just as in the days of the merchant sailors of Kalah the Yakkhos are described as hiding from sight, and leaving their merchandise on the shore for exchange: so we still find them withdrawing their houses from the busy high roads that now connect Puttalam with Kurunegala and Anuradhapura, and altogether abstaining from mixing in the commerce around them or the colonies of settlers that have come among them.\n\nI must also notice that at Kalaputti, or Kalpitiya, during various excavations, large quantities of coins, gold and copper, have been brought to light, and of the latter the commonest bear the name of Sahasa Mallawa, who reigned over Ceylon in A.D. 1202, though the Mahawansa tells us that he was deposed after two years,\u2014two facts apparently at variance with each other and requiring explanation; others are of Lilawati and Dharmasoka Dewa.\n\nFrom the vast amount of treasure buried through some miles of the country shortly after A.D. 1202, it is clear there must have been at that time some great and unexpected calamity and\ninvasion, so that it is probable that when the rule of the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1s of Zabedj finally collapsed and their wide domains fell under different sway, the protection withdrawn from Kalah was the cause of successful forays and inroads from the opposite coast of India or the Sinhalese capital, and that the wealthy community was then broken up and its trade abandoned.\n\nFrom the absence of buried hoards of any extent before or after this date, there is no doubt no such previous invasion took place, and never since, for probably never again did it recover from the blow received.\n\nWithin four square miles in the memory of the older people, there has been found near Kalpi\u1e6diya probably as much as a thousand pounds' worth of hidden treasure, gold coins and copper being the principal, but even a gold statue having been dug up by the father of the present Tamil Mudaliy\u00e1r of the district.\n\nTo conclude, I have endeavoured to show that the emporium of Taprobane or Serendib, from B.C. 500 until a comparatively recent time, was not Galle, but the coast from Mann\u00e1r to the D\u00e9duru-oya (the Northern limit of the M\u00e1y\u00e1-ra\u1e6da): that it was separated from the capital of the Sinhalese by jealousies that account for the silence of the Sinhalese chronicles: and that it forms the Kalah so often referred to.\n\nAs to which point on its coast we are to regard as the emporium, I cannot on the data yet known decide. I incline to think however, that the coast around, and opposite to, Kalpi\u1e6diya formed the centre of trade, and that the emporium was not one defined spot, but a cluster of petty ports all bartering the luxuries of the Far East for silver, and the wares of Europe, Persia, and Ethiopia; while the site of Tammann\u00e1 Nuwara with the adjacent ruins of Mah\u00e1-tabuwa was the Capital of the ruler who governed under the Sultans of Zabedj.\nThere remains only one further matter in relation to my subject to which I need still refer in recapitulation, and that is the bearing on it of the ancient accounts of the inhabitants of Ceylon before the Aryan immigration under and subsequent to Wijaya.\n\nThey are described as of two classes, Yakkhos and N\u00e1gas. I think it is now universally accepted that N\u00e1gas were an aboriginal tribe of snake worshippers, and formed, with an infusion of Aryan blood, the bulk of our present Si\u1e45halese. What then were the Yakkhos? Have I not succeeded in showing there was from the Islands of Adam\u2019s Bridge on the North, down to the D\u00e9duru-oya near Chilaw on the South, an ancient trading district forming an emporium for the East and West, and under a separate ruler of its own, opposed to the Chief King of the N\u00e1gas at La\u0144k\u00e1pura and the Kings who succeeded Wijaya? What more natural than that the people of this colony of the empire of Zabedj should be the Yakkhos, or demon worshippers (? Saivites), as opposed to the N\u00e1gas, or snake worshippers, who were the aborigines of the rest of the Island; and what more probable than that as the Si\u1e45halese of to-day represent the race of N\u00e1gas, so the Tamils of the Jaffna Wanni, Eastern Province, and the Puttalam District represent the Yakkhos who held the country in which was the port, and who were opposed to the N\u00e1gas who held the rest of the Island.\n\nNOTES.\n\n(1)\n\nI think the references here made to the Ceylon N\u00e1gas, as snake worshippers, perhaps justify the following note:\n\nIn the Ceylon Museum will be found the pottery image of a coiled cobra and also what looks like a lamp. These are of a peculiar and heavy pottery different to any I have yet seen from Ceylon. They were the only relics found under a crumbling heap of brickwork excavated on a little quoin rock in Bintenna, and are, as far as I know,\nthe only such recorded relics of the Ophid, or N\u00e1ga, cult in Ceylon.\n\nI was for a long while struck with surprise that the Ophid, or N\u00e1ga, image should have been enclosed in a mound of brick like a Buddhist relic, but on reading the notes in Fa-Hian's account of the combination of the Buddhist with the ancient Ophid cult at Samkassa (chapter xvii of Laidlay's translation) in this connection, I unexpectedly found Cunningham describing the ruins of the Ophid shrine as follows: \"It is a small mound of ruined bricks dedicated to the worship of the N\u00e1ga. Nothing whatever is erected there; but whenever rain is desired the people proceed to the spot and pray for it. The period of annual worship however is the month of Bys\u00e1kh, [? Sighalese, Wesak, \u0db8\u0dd9\u0dc3\u0d9a\u0dca] just before the commencement of the seasonal rains, when the village women go there in procession and make offerings of milk, which they pour out on the spot. This is no doubt the identical dragon (N\u00e1ga) which Fa-Hian mentions as appearing 'once every year,' from whose favour the people of Seng-kia-shi [this is Samkassa] obtained propitious rains and abundant harvests.\"\n\nI shall be excused for here further quoting the text of Fa-Hian (A.D. 400) to show the conclusive grounds for believing the Ophid cult actually witnessed by Captain Cunningham was practically identical with that witnessed by Fa-Hian. \"Their stay being ended, the dragon assumes the form of a little serpent with two ears bordered with white. When the ecclesiastics perceive him, they present him with cream in a copper vessel......He comes out once every year.\" And again ante: \"It is he who confers fertility and abundance on the country by causing gentle showers to fall upon the fields, and securing them against all calamities.\"\n\nI italicise two points in these accounts as worthy of attention: the one is the ascendancy of \"women\" in the Ophid ceremony, and the other is the expression \"two ears bordered with white.\" With reference to the former I draw attention to the ascendancy of woman as quite antagonistic to the usual Indo-Aryan customs, and suggest an additional deduction from it, that the Ophid cult was not of origin among an Indo-Aryan race; as to the snake, local knowledge enables me to\npoint out that there is a peculiar word always for the hood, or pen\u00e9,* of the cobra, which would have no Chinese equivalent, and which it would be difficult for Fa-Hian to translate or express without a very long explanation. No doubt Fa-Hian when he says \"white ears\" means 'white sides to the hood'; and it is well known that in India and Ceylon this albino, or partially albino, cobra is not very uncommon, and regarded with special veneration.\n\nIt is generally known that if enquiry be made from any intelligent old Sinhalese villager as to the habits of the cobra, he states that it has a special passion for new milk, and can always be enticed from its lurking place by a bowl of this delicacy. Are we to regard this belief as arising from fact, and originating milk as the offering made to the N\u00e1ga? or has a tradition that milk is the offering made given rise to the popular belief?\n\nThis is a most interesting question, and it is much to be wished one of our Members would experiment and report on the attraction milk or cream may, or may not, possess for the cobra.\n\nIn this connection I have asked my friend Mr. Haly, Director of the Ceylon Museum, if possible, to exhibit the N\u00e1ga and lamp presented by me to the Museum at the reading of this Paper, and also to exhibit for me two especially fine and ancient masks of the mythical King and Queen of the N\u00e1gas procured by me in the interior of the Southern Province, and still in my collection. I think it is possible what appears to be a lamp (found just in front of the snake) is in reality the dish for the offering of milk.\n\n(2)\n\nThis Paper is so largely mixed up with matter extracted from Fa Hian's travels, that the following notes on his account of Ceylon may be here appended:\n\n(i.) Firstly, observe the hitherto (as far as I know) neglected passage in which he, a devout Buddhist Priest, says the tradition in A.D. 400 was that the sacred B\u00f3 tree was grown at Anur\u00e1dhapura\n\n* S. \u0db8\u0dd4\u0dab\u0dca\u0da7\u0dd2, 'the cobra's hood,' and \u0db8\u0dd4\u0dab\u0dca\u0da7\u0dd2\u0dc0\u0dbd\u0dca, penogoba, 'the inside of the extended hood.'\u2014Hon. Sec.\nfrom \"seeds\" specially fetched from the Gangetic District. Fa-Hian's careful account of it throws much doubt on the otherwise miraculous, and to a horticulturist improbable, story, that the tree was a cutting from the original. No doubt, I think, the Sighalese chronicles have been tampered with, and the origin of the tree embellished since Fa-Hian wrote.\n\n(ii.) \"The Mountain without Fear\" is correctly identified in the notes to Laidlay's edition (p. 342) as the Abhayagiri Vih\u00e1r\u00e9.\n\n(iii.) With regard to the chapel \"Po-thi,\" should we not read this \"Bodhi\"? The Samanean's name we may safely read as \"Dharmajoti,\" for Tha-mo-ku-ti as it is written in Chinese\u2014a language unfitted to express Sanscrit more precisely. The \"stone house\" in which Dharmajoti lived with his rats and snakes is no doubt the literal rendering of 'cave,' still called by the Sighalese gal-g\u00e9, \u0d9c\u0dbd\u0dca\u0d9c\u0dda, 'stone house.'\n\n(iv.) Who were \"the merchants Sa-pho\"? I think this is worth enquiring, but, as far as I can see, the word must be a Chinese substitute for the original.\n\n(v.) As to the statue at the Abhayagiri Vih\u00e1r\u00e9 made of \"blue jasper\" and over 18 feet high, of what was the lustrous image really made? It is not conceivable so large a block of lapis lazuli could have found its way to Ceylon from North Asia, nor have turquoise or sapphire ever been heard of of such size.\n\nThe only approximate artificial product then known was the rare and beautiful blue glass used for the celebrated Portland vase, and the Theban pottery coated with a brilliant blue enamel like turquoise, of which small gods and amulets form the exquisite speciality of Egyptian antiquity. Is it possible this statue was made in Egypt for sale in Ceylon? Or that an ancient Egyptian god was brought to Ceylon for sale after its worship had died out in Egypt.\n\nAny fragment with blue enamel on it found among the d\u00e9bris near the Abhayagiri Vih\u00e1r\u00e9 should be carefully preserved, as its origin could at once be decided if Egyptian, and by encouraging a further search of the d\u00e9bris might lead to the partial recovery of an unique antiquity.\n(vi.) It is also desirable to note the tradition that the \"great tower 40 chang* high\" (? the Brazen Palace) was built over a footprint of Buddha.\n\n(vii.) The visit of the King to the Treasury of the Priesthood where the coveted \"Mo-ni\" (? ruby) was kept, will be found described in the Sinhalese chronicles, which, if my memory can be trusted, say the treasure chamber was under a D\u00e1goba to which they had access by a secret passage.\n\n(viii.) Fa-Hian describes the Dalad\u0101 temple at Anur\u00e1dhapura in A.D. 410, as decorated \"with the seven precious things.\" It may not be out of place to draw attention to the Chinese interpretation of these. (See Fa-Hian, Laidlay's edition, chapter xiii, and note (4) by Klapproth.)\n\nTwo series are here given from the Chinese Buddhist writings, but I think they are scarcely in each case rightly translated, and propose the following corrections:\n\nFirst series.\n\n1.\u2014Sou-fa-lo\u2014(suvarna)=gold.\n2.\u2014A-lou-pa\u2014(r\u00e1piya)=silver.\n3.\u2014Lieou-li\u2014in the Kowan-king-sou called Fei-lieou-li-ye which signifies \"not far.\" This is explained as identical with Vaid\u00farya (Sanscrit)\u2014the mountain Vid\u00fara on which Vaid\u00farya was found being \"not far\" (i.e., \"Vid\u00fara\") from Benares. Burnouf translated Vaid\u00farya as \"lapis lazuli.\" This I think is wrong. The hardness, the colour (green or blue), and the locality, all point to Oriental turquoise as the mineral here denoted, and there can be little doubt Lieou-li must be read \"turquoise\" and not \"lapis lazuli.\" I doubt the identification with Vaid\u00farya, which I have always elsewhere construed as corundum or sapphire.\n\n4.\u2014Pho-li, or Se-pho-ti-kia (sphatika)=rock crystal.\n5.\u2014Meou-pho-lo-kie-la-pho. This is star sapphire or asteria, not fossil, ammonite as somewhat wildly conjectured; the rays of the\n\n* \"A chang is a measure of 10 Chinese feet, and the Chinese foot is 8 lines shorter than ours.\"\nstar form the spokes of the wheel. May we not recognise in the wheel formed by the star on a round gem of asteria, the sacred symbol of the wheel, which accounts for the present belief among some Oriental races that there is a god in the asteria, although they have forgotten the reason for their superstition, and substitute the god for the symbol?\n\n6.\u2014Mo-lo-kia-li=agate.\n\n7.\u2014Po-mo-lo-kia (padmar\u00e1ga)=ruby.\n\nWe must here notice this ancient origin of the still existing Ceylon superstition, that the finest rubies lie in the head of cobras. This extraordinary myth seems to have been an accepted matter when the Chinese authors wrote.\n\nMay we not now translate this myth as simply the exaggerated form that arose when the Indo-Aryan races began to confuse the N\u00e1gas (ophid cult) and Yakkhos (perhaps an early form of Saivites) with actual snakes and demons, in which secondary sense the original name of the races evidently came after a time to be used by the Aryan invaders?* It might then simply mean, the N\u00e1gas with whom rubies are found in a secret and jealously guarded place, instead of the rubies hidden in the head of the cobras and jealously guarded, as we have recently been too literally interpreting it.\n\nSecond Series.\n\n1\u2014Po-lo-so=(prab\u00e1la) coral. Here I ask your attention to the Chinese account, that it was found on an Island to the S.W. [of the Gangetic countries or? of China] and dredged by iron nets from submerged rocks [evidently at a great depth, or divers would have\n\n---\n\n* \"Naglok (snake land) was at an early period a Hind\u00fa name for hell. But the N\u00e1gas were not real snakes\u2014in that case they might have fared better\u2014but an aboriginal tribe in Ceylon, believed by the Hind\u00fas to be of serpent origin,\u2014N\u00e1ga being an epithet for 'native.' The term is now used very vaguely. Mr. Talboys Wheeler, speaking of the 'Scythic N\u00e1gas' (History of India, Vol. I p. 147), says:\u2014'In process of time these N\u00e1gas became identified with serpents, and the result has been a strange confusion between serpents and human beings.' In the 'Padma Pur\u00e1na' we read of 'serpent-like men.' The dreaded powers were from another tribe designated Yakkhos 'demons.'\"\u2014Conway, \"Demonology and Devil-lore,\" Vol.I., p. 151.\u2014Hon. Sec.\nbeen employed]. This account agrees with fact. On the S.W. coast of Ceylon at Balapitiya, a considerable quantity of small pieces of valuable red coral, much water-worn, are annually washed up during the S.W. monsoon. The site on which it grows is no longer known, possibly it may come from a great distance S.W. of our coast, though I am inclined to think not from such a distance as the M\u00e1ldives.\n\nI have asked Mr. Haly to exhibit some coral picked up by me as above described.\n\n2.\u2014A-chy-ma-kie-pho (? asmagarbha). This is I think wrongly identified as amber. This transparent red substance should be translated carbuncle or garnet. It was in carbuncle that ancient Indian intaglios were cut, the translucency of the stone when cut thin giving great effect to the workmanship.\n\n3.\u2014Ma-ni or mo-ni\u2014pearl.\n\n4.\u2014Chin-shou-kia\u2014a gem like the flower of the kimsuka tree (Butea frondosa) [see First Book, Indian Botany, Olliver], that is of an orange red colour. This unidentified substance should be translated Oriental topaz (yellow, pink or orange corundum), one variety of which satisfactorily answers to the description.\n\n5.\u2014Shy-kia-pi-ling-kia\u2014not translated. This may be read diamond. The word \u201cpi-ling-kia\u201d is evidently of common origin from Sanskrit, with the modern Singhalese pa\u0142ingu (\u0db4\u0dcf\u0dbd\u0dd2\u0db1\u0dd4), which is used for crystal.\n\n6.\u2014Mo-lo-kia-pho\u2014translated marakata, or emerald. I would suggest another interpretation of chrysoberyl, or cat\u2019s-eye.\n\nThe Indian cat\u2019s-eye (quartz) is of remarkable softness, and is cut even by a pen-knife. The two forms of cat\u2019s-eye may have been confused. Has the Chinese form \u201cMo-lo-kia\u201d any origin in the Indo-Aryan word \u201csoft\u201d (S. molok, \u092e\u094b\u0932\u0915)? I am not myself scholar enough to say whether this word was then used in the Gangetic District in the sense of softness\u2014easy to cut. The same word occurs above possibly in Mo-lo-kia-li (agate), from which we learn vases were cut. I recall a passage in some old Oriental book\u2014I forget which, but think it is in the Ummagga J\u0101taka\u2014in which this word moloka is used in reference to the softness of a thigh as a pillow. Perhaps one of our Members may be able to rectify my\nignorance by stating whether such a word for 'soft' was in Indo-Aryan usage in above sense of 'easy to cut.'\n\n7.\u2014Pa-che-lo.\u2014This is translated vajra, or diamond, and is clearly erroneous. The colour, we are told, is like that of an amethyst and the stone is used for engraving others. It must be translated sapphire or corundum.\n\nWe have in these (what the learned annotators of course could not see with the imperfect light then thrown on the minerals) a parallel series in colour, thus:\n\nLight \\{ gold=Oriental topaz=? sun=? life. \\\\\nsilver=pearl=? moon=? death.\n\nCrystal=diamond=? ether. \\\\\nAsteria=(emerald or) cat's-eye=? air.\n\nFive elements \\{ Turquoise=sapphire=? water. \\\\\nRuby=carbuncle=? fire. \\\\\nAgate=coral=? earth.\n\nBoth gold and silver have in the ancient books one four-fold attribute, of which \"changeless,\" \"indestructible,\" \"incorruptible,\" and \"omnipotent\" would be the euphonious transcription.\n\n\"The seven precious things\" might thus symbolise the five elements:\u2014ether which is supported by (? generating) air, air supported by (? generating) fire resting on water, and water supported by (generating) earth, all adorned by the attributes of gold and silver: that is changeless, indestructible, incorruptible, and omnipotent, in one sense, and combined with light\u2014i.e., sun and moon\u2014in another.\n\nThis is a well-known ancient symbol of the elements.\n\nA, ether\u2014B, air\u2014C, fire\u2014D, water\u2014and E, earth\u2014which, by adoption among Buddhists give rise to the present D\u00e1gobas, originally no doubt erected over his remains, and symbolically used to show the return of Gautama Buddha to the five primitive and indestructible elements. We should thus have the shape of the D\u00e1goba borrowed from the symbol of creation of an older cult by the Buddhists, and further illustration of it by the seven precious ornaments.\n\nIn addition, then, to the question of the colours probably symbolising the five elements with neither beginning nor end, I would suggest\nthe study amongst our Members of the question, whether in our ancient records there is any account showing that the five colours were applied separately to the different parts of the St\u00fapa or D\u00e1goba, which I suggest they may symbolise. Thus, whether the rectangular case was painted red, the dome was painted blue, &c.\n\nIt is quite possible the colouring of a St\u00fapa may have been so arranged and a record preserved thereof.\n\nTo recapitulate. I suggest these \"seven precious things\" are the symbol of a cult which taught that the five elements combined with light (sun and moon) are the origin of all things and source of creation. In detail we may read the symbol that by action of (light causing) fire (heat) on water resting on earth proceeds air penetrated by the apex of the triangle of fire (heat), above which rests ether from which the triangle fire radiates but into which it does not enter; thus giving us in ether, or the firmament above our atmosphere, combined with sun and moon, or light, the creative power which shaped the earth into its four other distinct elements. Bearing this in mind, a special interest will follow the work of local students, who will take the trouble to record the exact shape of the various St\u00fapas or D\u00e1gobas still existent, or adequately described in ancient records, as they gradually diverged from the primitive type.\n\nMy view of the original Buddhist symbolised theory of creation, here suggested, accounts for the early Buddhist writers classing the theory of creation of the contemporary sect they call \"strong-mouth\" as an heresy. This sect, existing in and established before the lifetime of Gautama Buddha, taught that ether begat air, air begat fire\u2014fire, heat\u2014heat, water\u2014water, ice\u2014and the ice solidified begat earth\u2014and earth begat five kinds of grain, which produce life, which when ended returns to ether.\n\nIt will be seen then \"the heresy\" would consist in the interpolation of a glacial period in the earth's stage of development into dry land, and the mediation of vegetation derived from land; thus the meaning veiled in the seven precious things of early Buddhism is closely akin\u2014but brings in the action of sun and moon, and omits glacial and vegetable influence on creation.\nON THE SINHALESE OBSERVANCE OF THE KALAWA.\n\nBy L. NELL, Esq.\n\nSome time ago my attention was drawn to the belief of the common people amongst the Sinhalese in the kalawa (\u0d9a\u0dbd\u0dc0). This, according to the impression left on my mind, was some moveable principle or predisposition, moving in a certain course in the human body in accordance with the lunar calendar. The believers in the kalawa assert, that when it is in position on the crown of the head, the scratch of a pin on that part would be sufficient to cause death; so, on the day of this kalawa, women in some parts of the interior of the Island will decline to carry loads of firewood on the head. In like manner, on the new moon day labourers will not go into the jungle to clear it, on account of the risk of injuries to the toe of the foot. On the 6th day of the first half, and the 10th day of the second half, of the lunar month, it is considered dangerous to take a purgative medicine, the seat of the kalawa being then supposed to be in the belly. On the 7th day leeches should not be applied to the region of the chest.\n\nIn the case of a man, the kalawa rises, with the moon, from the big toe of the right foot, from part to part, till, on the 15th day of the moon, it reaches the crown of the head. It then descends in corresponding parts on the left side, till, on the 30th day, it reaches the big toe of the left foot, ready again to ascend on the right side. In the case of a woman, the movement is reversed, since it ascends on the left side and descends on the right, the positions being otherwise the same: that is, the kalawa ascends from the left great toe upwards to the crown of the head, then descends by the same degrees to the right toe. This corresponds to a principle in native\npalmistry, according to which the fortune of a male is told from the lines on his right hand, of a female from those on the left hand.\n\nI found subsequently that Tables of the kal\u00e1ma had been published in a Sheet Almanac, printed in a native vernacular press in Galle,\u2014in a Sinhalese Ephemeris for the year, printed in a pamphlet of 54 pages,\u2014and in a Sheet Almanac published by the press of the Lakrivikirana newspaper. Though this led to the idea that the subject was well known, I was surprised to find discrepancies when the Tables were translated. This led me to make personal enquiries during a short visit to the Bentota District, where I questioned the learned priest, Kohomala Indus\u00e1ra, and a native Vedar\u00e1la or medical practitioner. I was surprised to find that the latter had little or no knowledge of a subject so important, apparently, in native medical science.\n\nIn the discussion with the priest, a difficulty arose from his division of the lunar month into sixteen kal\u00e1; namely, (1) Am\u00e1naka, \u0d85\u0db8\u0dcf\u0db1\u0d9a, the day on which the moon does not appear; (2) P\u00e9laviya, \u0db4\u0dd9\u0dbd\u0dc0\u0dd2\u0dba, the day on which the moon first appears; (3) Diyanaka, \u0daf\u0dd2\u0dba\u0db1\u0d9a, the second day; (4) Tiyawaka, \u0dad\u0dd2\u0dba\u0dc0\u0db1\u0d9a, the third day; (5) Jalawaka, \u0d9a\u0dbd\u0dc0\u0db1\u0d9a, fourth; (6) Wis\u00e9niya, \u0dc0\u0dd2\u0dc3\u0dda\u0db1\u0dd2\u0dba, fifth; (7) Satawaka, \u0dc3\u0dad\u0dc0\u0db1\u0d9a; (8) Satawaka, \u0dc3\u0dad\u0dc0\u0db1\u0d9a; (9) Atawaka, \u0d85\u0dad\u0dc0\u0db1\u0d9a; (10) Namawaka, \u0db1\u0db8\u0dc0\u0db1\u0d9a; (11) Dasawaka, \u0daf\u0dc3\u0dc0\u0db1\u0d9a; (12) Ekaloswaka, \u0d87\u0d9a\u0dbd\u0ddd\u0dc3\u0dca\u0dc0\u0db1\u0d9a; (13) Doloswaka, \u0daf\u0ddc\u0dbd\u0ddd\u0dc3\u0dca\u0dc0\u0db1\u0d9a; (14) Teleswaka, \u0dad\u0dd9\u0dbd\u0dda\u0dc3\u0dca\u0dc0\u0db1\u0d9a; (15) Tuduswaka, \u0dad\u0dd4\u0daf\u0dd4\u0dc3\u0dca\u0dc0\u0db1\u0d9a; and (16) Pasaloswaka, \u0db4\u0dcf\u0dc3\u0dbd\u0ddd\u0dc3\u0dca\u0dc0\u0db1\u0d9a.\n\nThis, of course, omitting the day on which the moon does not appear, is the lunar calendar\u2014the full moon with the common people being known as the pahaloswaka-p\u00f3ya (\u0db4\u0dc4\u0dbd\u0ddd\u0dc3\u0dca\u0dc0\u0db1\u0d9a \u0db4\u0ddd\u0dba) or \u2018p\u00f3ya of the 15th lunar day.\u2019 The counting of the kal\u00e1 on which the moon does not appear introduces a\ndifficulty, since the kal\u00e1wa can ordinarily be only counted with 30 lunar days. The sixteen kal\u00e1, enumerated by the priest, therefore refer to the intervals between these \"days,\" and correspond to the 16th part of the disc of the moon, which will be referred to in a definition to be here quoted.\n\nIn the month during which I was making these enquiries, the new moon had risen on Wednesday, the 30th of March, at 3:52 P.M.: the first quarter, on Wednesday, the 6th of April, at 9:14 P.M.: the full moon on the next Thursday, at 5:9 P.M.: and the last quarter moon on Thursday, the 28th of April, at 3:44 P.M. So that, even taking the particulars given in an English Almanac, it must be a matter of difficulty for ordinary natives to fix the exact time of the commencement and close of each kal\u00e1wa, granting that it corresponds with a particular lunar day. This probably led to the neglect of this part of the native science in the empirical practice of the Vedar\u00e1las. It will also appear that even with the assistance of the native Tables (translations of which are appended), the science will be of difficult application till the limits of each kal\u00e1wa are more accurately limited. The duration of a particular kal\u00e1wa may, of course, be roughly recognized during some part of a lunar day, and the most ignorant native is usually aware of the principal phases of the moon from the practice of faithfully observing the poya days.\n\nL. De Zoyza, Mah\u00e1-Mudaliy\u00e1r, after kindly making enquiries at my request, wrote:\u2014\"I have received the explanation of two of the best Vedar\u00e1las here about the kal\u00e1wa; but they are somewhat contradictory, and I cannot make much sense of them. The truth is that their ideas of the matter are very vague.\"\n\nUnder these circumstances the derivation of the term is calculated to throw some light on the subject. According to the priest, already referred to, the term kal\u00e1 may be Sanskrit,\nP\u00e1li, or Elu, and means 'a share.' De Zoyza, M\u00e1ha-Mudaliy\u00e1r, pronounces it a Sanskrit, or P\u00e1li word, to which the following meanings have been given in the Dictionaries:\u2014(i) 'a part'; (ii) 'a fraction'; (iii) 'the 16th part of the Moon's disc'; (iv) 'a mechanical act;' (v) 'a division of time.' The kal\u00e1, \u0d9a\u0dcf\u0dbd, or Kal\u00e1na, \u0d9a\u0dcf\u0dbd\u0db1, in Sinhalese, of which we are now treating, he renders as 'the sixteenth part, or digit, of the moon's disc, which in some mysterious way ascends and descends in the human body.' As it is always difficult to apply a term of one language to translate a term of another accurately, each in its native use being associated with ideas foreign to the other, we must modify this definition. I think my original conception will consist with taking kal\u00e1na as a derivative from kal\u00e1, and the idea obtained will therefore be, that of some moving principle, or local predisposition, following a course in the human body in relation to the course of the moon in her increase and decrease.\n\nIn the examination of the calendar of the kal\u00e1na, many discrepancies occur in the various versions received by me. I propose to add translations of the two published versions, as they are probably more generally accepted on account of their publication. The principal discrepancies in the various accounts are in the fourth kal\u00e1na, described as \"the calf\" or \"the knee-cap\"; the eleventh described as \"the lip,\" \"the lower lip,\" \"the cheek.\" This second discrepancy may spring from the general application of the term tola \u0dad\u0ddc\u0dbd to the region of the fore-teeth, the lips, cheek, and chin.\n\nBut besides these discrepancies in details, I found that my original information, distinguishing the Mul-kal\u00e1na, \u0db8\u0dd4\u0dbd\u0dca\u0d9a\u0dcf\u0dbd\u0db1 from the Amrita-kal\u00e1na, \u0d85\u0db8\u0dca\u0dbb\u0dd2\u0da7\u0d9a\u0dcf\u0dbd\u0db1 (erroneously called Mruta-kal\u00e1na, \u0db8\u0dd4\u0da7\u0dca\u0da7\u0d9a\u0dcf\u0dbd\u0db1) was altogether wrong. It appears that in Sinhalese popular medical works the Amrita-kal\u00e1na means literally 'the ambrosial' or 'good' kal\u00e1na. The\nVisa-kal\u00e1wa, \u0dc0\u0dd2\u0dc3\u0dcf\u0dbd\u0dcf\u0dc0, I would translate as 'the baneful (literally, 'poisonous') kal\u00e1wa.' It will be seen in the Table taken from the Lakrivikirana Sheet Almanac that the Visa-kal\u00e1wa is said to ascend on the left side in males, and on the right in females. This Table and that from the Lita or Ephemeris for the year give both the Visa-kal\u00e1wa and Amrita-kal\u00e1wa, which I have not obtained from other sources. There can be no doubt that the Mul-kal\u00e1wa, commonly spoken of, is the same as the Amrita-kal\u00e1wa. The Sinhalese Lita (page 50) advises that if the Amrita-kal\u00e1wa locates itself in any part of the body, care should be taken of it, as \"life\" then chiefly exists in it. In the case of Visa-kal\u00e1wa it is asserted that any wound or hurt to the part where it is located will bring calamity or death. The distinction of effect is not very clear, except that a hurt in the latter case appears to be considered as more directly baneful. The only explanations remaining to be made are: first, that when the kal\u00e1wa is in the arm-pit or shoulder, the whole arm and hand are involved; and secondly, that the Amrita-kal\u00e1wa moves at a certain distance from the Visa-kal\u00e1wa.\n**KALAWA TABLES.**\n\nThe Kalawa Table appearing in the Sheet Almanac of the Lakrivikirana is as follows:\n\n| Ascending Visa-kalawa | Ascending

Mah\u00e1-Mudaliy\u00e1r.\n\n(Read July 6th, 1881.)\n\nIn submitting the following Note to the Society, it is not my intention to enter upon the vexed question of the origin of the Veddas, but simply to call attention to an important passage in the Mah\u00e1wa\u1e47so relating thereto, the true meaning of which has been long hidden from the readers of that work by an erroneous rendering in Mr. Turnour's translation.\n\nThe 6th chapter of the Mah\u00e1wa\u1e47so gives an account of the arrival of Vijayo, the first monarch of the Sinhalese dynasty, B.C. 543. The 7th chapter relates his encounter with an aboriginal Princess named Kuv\u00e9ni, how he married her, and how he conquered the Island by her means.\n\nWhen she had borne him two children, a son named Jivahatto and a daughter named Dis\u00e1la, the King wished to divorce her and marry a Princess from Southern Madura. For this purpose he sent ambassadors to King P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davo of Madura, soliciting his daughter in marriage, and duly obtained his consent. On the arrival of the Princess from India, Vijayo \"thus explained himself to Kuw\u00e9ni: 'A daughter of royalty is a timid being; on that account, leaving the children with me, depart from my house.' She replied: 'On my account, having murdered Yakkhos, I dread these Yakkhos; now I am discarded\n\nIt is due to Mr. De Zoysa to record that he had no opportunity of perusing the Papers on the Veddas\u2014only very recently received from England\u2014of Messrs. J. Bailey (Trans. Ethnological Soc., Vol. II. n.s., Art. xxvi., 1863), and B. F. Hartshorne (Fortnightly Review, Art v, March, 1876), prior to writing the \"Note\" now printed. Mr. De Zoysa's Paper has been delayed, whilst in the press, to enable the Honorary Secretary to add (necessarily as Notes) some extracts bearing thereon.\nby both parties, whither can I betake myself?\" 'Within my dominions,' said he, 'to any place thou pleasest, which is unconnected with Yakkhos; and I will maintain thee with a thousand bali offerings.' She who had been thus interdicted (from re-uniting herself with the Yakkhos) with clamorous lamentation, taking her children with her, in the character of an inhuman being, wandered to that very city (La\u1e45k\u0101pura) of inhuman inhabitants. She left her children outside the Yakkha city. A Yakkho who detested her, recognising her in her search for a dwelling, went up to her. Thereupon another fierce Yakkho, among the enraged Yakkhos, asked: 'Is it for the purpose of again and again spying out the peace we enjoy that she is come?' In his fury he killed the Yakkhini with a blow of his open hand. Her uncle (a Yakkho named Kum\u0101ro) happening to proceed out of the Yakkha city, seeing these children outside the town\u2014'Whose children are ye?' said he. Being informed 'Kuw\u00e9ni's,' he said: 'Your mother is murdered: if ye should be seen here, they would murder you also\u2014fly quickly.' Instantly departing thence, they repaired to the (neighbourhood of the) Sumanta mountain. The elder having grown up, married his sister, and settled there. Becoming numerous by their sons and daughters, under the protection of the King they resided in that Malay\u00e1 district. This person (J\u00edwahatto) retained the attributes of the Yakkhos.\"\n\nNow, I submit that the rendering of the words \"\u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e\u094b \u0935\u0947\u0926\u093e\u0902\u0924\u0947 \u092f\u0925\u093e \u091c\u0928\u094d\u092e\u0924\u093f\" [Eso pulindd\u0101na\u00f1 hi sambhavo] by \"this person (Jiwahatto) retained the attributes of the Yakkhos,\" is erroneous, and that the words should be rendered \"This is the origin of the Pulind\u0101\"\u2014i.e., the Vedd\u00e1s.\n\n* Turnour's \"Mah\u00e1wa\u1e47so,\" Vol. I., p. 52: Cotta, 1837. Followed by Forbes' \"Eleven Years in Ceylon,\" Vol. II., p. 81; Pridham's \"Ceylon, &c.,\" Vol. I., p. 27; and Tennent's \"Ceylon,\" Vol. I., p. 371.\u2014Hon. Sec.\nIn the first place, the word \"\u092a\u0941\u0932\u093f\u0902\u0926\u093e\" [Pulind\u00e1] which Mr. Turnour renders by \"Yakkhos\" (who are supposed to be supernatural beings), is never applied to Yakkhos, but means Vedd\u00e1s. The following is the meaning given by Professor H. H. Wilson in his Dictionary of the Sanskrit language, p. 545: \"S. V.

It is not found in the Abhidh\u00e1nappad\u00edpik\u00e1, the only authorized vocabulary of the P\u00e1li language, nor in Childers' P\u00e1li Dictionary, nor in any other P\u00e1li work I have seen. But this need not excite much surprise, as Sanskrit words, not found in the P\u00e1li vocabulary, are sometimes found in P\u00e1li writings; e.g., in this very chapter of the Mah\u00e1wanso the word \"\u0938\u0941\u0930\u0941\u0902\u0917\u093e\" [surung\u00e1], which is pure Sanskrit and not found in the P\u00e1li vocabulary, is used for a \"subterraneous abode.\"\n\nIn the second place, \"\u0938\u092e\u094d\u092d\u0935\u094b\" [sambhavo], which Mr. Turnour translates \"attributes,\" means, according to Childers' P\u00e1li Dictionary (p. 431), \"production, birth, origin, cause, union, &c., &c.\"\n\nThe demonstrative adjective \"\u0925\u094b\" [\u00e9so] (nom. sing. m.)

Sec.\nnatural construction, I think, is to connect it with the noun *sambhavo* (nom. sing. m.) \"origin.\"\n\nI discovered this erroneous rendering many years ago, but for obvious reasons I have refrained from calling public attention to it. The truth is, I was extremely reluctant to do so from fear that I might unwittingly lead others to think that Turnour's translation of the Mah\u00e1wa\u1e47so is generally incorrect. Such is not my opinion. The few mistakes found in this great work are mere \"spots on the sun,\" and I do not think there is a better translation of a historical work in the East. It is not too much to say that this \"gifted Englishman\" has, by his writings and researches, undoubtedly done more for the development of the *historical* literature of India and Ceylon than all his predecessors and successors, both European and native.\n\nMy belief is, that Mr. Turnour's Kandyan Pandits, not knowing the meaning of this unusual word \"*Pulinda*\" which, as I stated above, is not found in the P\u00e1li vocabulary, erroneously interpreted it to mean \"Yakkho\" instead of \"*Vedd\u00e1*.\"\n\nI may here add that I have had the satisfaction of discovering that my reading is confirmed by the Commentary on the Mah\u00e1wa\u1e47so, which has the following gloss on the passage in question:\n\n\"*Pulindanay hi sambhavoti.* Etthahik\u00e1ro k\u00e1ra\u1e47atthe. Yasm\u00e1 te Pulind\u00e1nay \u00e1di puris\u00e1 hutv\u00e1 tattha vasi\u1e63u. Tasm\u00e1 eththa Pulind\u00e1nay eso sambhavo \u00e1yuppatt\u00edti vi\u00f1\u00f1eyyo ahos\u00ed ti attho.\"\n\n\"'Pulindanay hi sambhavoti.'\u2014Here the letter 'hi' signifies 'cause' or 'reason.' On what account did they, becoming the progenitors (*\u00e1di puris\u00e1*) of the *Pulind\u00e1*, reside here (Malaya Division), on that account it should be known that this is the origin, first existence, of the *Pulind\u00e1*.\"\nIt will be seen from the above exegesis that they (Kuv\u00e9ni\u2019s children, Jiwa hatto and Dis\u00e1la) are spoken of by the commentator as \u201cthe progenitors\u201d [A\u2019di puris\u00e1], of the Pulind\u00e1s (Vedd\u00e1s).\n\nI am, moreover, in a position to add that the tradition that the Vedd\u00e1s are the descendants of Kuv\u00e9ni\u2019s children by Vijayo, is still current in some parts of the Kandyan country. In 1879, when I visited the Ratnapura and U\u2019va Districts to inspect Temple Libraries, I made it a point to collect information about the Vedd\u00e1s, whenever an opportunity occurred. When at P\u00e9lma\u1e0dulla Vih\u00e1r\u00e9, I enquired from the incumbent, Induruw\u00e9 Piyadassi Unn\u00e1ns\u00e9, whether he knew anything about the origin of the Vedd\u00e1s, and, to my surprise, he said at once that the tradition is that they are descendants of Kuv\u00e9ni\u2019s children by Vijayo. On my enquiry, whether he had read the passage in the Mah\u00e1wa\u014bso which forms the subject of this note, he replied he had never seen it, but that his information was derived from a Sinhalese work on the Vedd\u00e1s, which he had seen long ago in the possession of a native. He added that, according to that work, the Vedd\u00e1s first settled in Sabara-gamuwa, and hence the name for the district from Sabara \u2018a Vedd\u00e1,\u2019 and gamuwa \u2018a Village,\u2019 in strict conformity with the tradition, recorded in the Mah\u00e1wa\u014bso, that Kuv\u00e9ni\u2019s children settled themselves in the country near Samantak\u016b\u1e6da mountain (Adam\u2019s Peak), and became \u201cnumerous by their sons and daughters.\u201d I made every possible endeavour, both at Ratnapura and Badulla, to trace the work referred to, but unfortunately without success.\n\nWhen at Badulla, a low-country Sinhalese man, who had travelled much in Bint\u00ebnn\u00e0, and from whom I collected information about the Vedd\u00e1s, their songs, charms, &c., also stated the tradition current in Bint\u00ebnn\u00e0 is \u2018that the Vedd\u00e1s are descendants of Kuv\u00e9ni\u2019s children.\u2019 He further informed me that the Vedd\u00e1s themselves claim to be descendants of royalty,\nand considered the Sinhalese, whom they call 'Hingalu,' to be an inferior race.\n\n**VEDDA' SONGS.**\n\n**No. 1.**\n\nUda kad\u00e1ne mal pip\u00ed  \nPall\u00e9 kad\u00e1net\u00e1 vet\u00edn  \nPall\u00e9 kad\u00e1ne mal pip\u00ed  \nUda kad\u00e1net\u00e1 vet\u00edg\u00f3  \nUda n\u00e1 vinn\u00e9 n\u00e1 mal pip\u00ed  \nPall\u00e9 n\u00e1 vinnata vet\u00edg\u00f3  \nPall\u00e9 n\u00e1 vinn\u00e9 n\u00e1 mal pip\u00ed  \nUda n\u00e1 vinnata vet\u00edg\u00f3\n\nFlowers blossom in the upper thicket,  \nThey fall into the lower thicket:  \nFlowers blossom in the lower thicket,  \nThey fall into the upper thicket.  \nN\u00e1 flowers blossom in the upper n\u00e1 forest,  \nThey fall into the lower n\u00e1 forest:  \nN\u00e1 flowers blossom in the lower n\u00e1 forest,  \nThey fall into the upper n\u00e1 forest.\n\n**No. 2.**\n\nM\u00e1mini m\u00e1mini m\u00e1 deyy\u00e1  \nM\u00e1mini m\u00e1mihi m\u00e1 deyy\u00e1  \nK\u00e1ben p\u00e1bala yak gama v\u00e9  \nK\u00e1ben p\u00e1bala yak gama v\u00e9  \nYamu denn\u00e1  \nYamu denn\u00e1\n\nBimen yanna ta bolpini b\u00e9rinam  \nVad\u00e1n\u00e1 m\u00edma lanu b\u00e9dagan  \nM\u00edm\u00e1 piten yamu denn\u00e1  \nG\u00f3b\u00edndu kel\u00e9 yamu denn\u00e1  \nG\u00f3y\u00e1 puchch\u00e1 kamu denn\u00e1  \nG\u00f3 tombo puchch\u00e1 kamu denn\u00e1  \nG\u00f3 kura puchch\u00e1 kamu denn\u00e1  \nG\u00f3 b\u00e1dav\u00e9l tika tata denn\u00e1  \nG\u00f3 akum\u00e1 tika ma\u014b ka\u00f1\u00f1a\n\n* Each line of the songs should be repeated twice, and the vowels lengthened or shortened in pronunciation according to the exigencies of the metre.\n\n\u2020 [nd].\u2014Ironwood tree (Mesua ferrea, L.)\nV\u0113lkobb\u0101 v\u0113la dunna nam\u0101gana\nEnn\u00e9 Olagala M\u0101 Lokuv\u014d\nAngara netum natana nang\u012b\u1e6da\nR\u016bbara berapada gach\u0101p\u014d\nVal aten nat\u0101p\u014d\nChonda chonda netun nat\u0101p\u014d\nApatat vettila bed\u0101p\u014d\nGollat bos\u0113ma indinnan\nVallat karak\u0101 nat\u0101pan\nMetta\u1e6da av\u0101 bola deyy\u014d\nTa\u1e47 tadin\u0101n\u0113 tadin\u0101n\u0113\nTa\u1e47 tadin\u0101n\u0113 tadin\u0101n\u0113\n\nO great man!

Fields, villages, and families yet retain the name of Vedd\u00e1s, as Vedi-pa\u1e45gu, V\u00e9dde-kumbura, V\u00e9dde-watta, V\u00e9dde-ela, V\u00e9dde-gala, V\u00e9dde-g\u00e9, &c., in the district of Saffragam, which is the country at the foot of Adam's Peak, and in the Rayigam K\u00f3ral\u00e9.\"\nIndeed, Saffragam or Habara\u011famuwa means 'the district of Vedd\u00e1s' or 'barbarous people'; and in this form of the word the former existence of Vedd\u00e1s can again be traced as Habara-goda, Habara-kaduwa, &c. It is traditional throughout Saffragam that once Vedd\u00e1s predominated over Sinhalese in that district, and that, as the latter gained ground, the former withdrew towards Bintenna and Wellassa. But Mr. Macready, of the Civil Service, has given me very important proof of the existence of Vedd\u00e1s near the Samanta mountains. He has given me the translation of some stanzas from a Sinhalese poem, written about 400 years ago, called the Paravi-sand\u0113\u015baya, or 'the Dove's message.'* The poem treats of a message sent by means of a dove, from K\u00f3tt\u00e9 (near Colombo) to Vishnu at Dondra, at the extreme south of the Island. The dove takes its course exactly over the districts lying below Adam's Peak. The poet addresses the dove, and tells her she will see [at Potupitiya] 'the daughters of the Vedd\u00e1s' clothed in ri\u1e6di\u2020 bark, their hair adorned with peacock's plumes. So wild are they that the poet describes the herds of deer as being startled at the sight of them.\"\u2014J.

C. P. B., Hon. Sec.\n\nNo. 4.\n\n\"The bare assertion by a naked savage in the rudest state of barbarism, that he is the descendant of Kings, seems, at first, a sheer absurdity, though it naturally suggests the inquiry how the claim to so ambitious an origin could have arisen, and, having arisen, how it should be so pertinaciously adhered to by tribes unknown to each other.\n\n\"The custom which sanctions such revolting marriages [between brothers and younger sisters] seems, at first sight, simply a proof of the extreme depth of barbarism to which the race has sunk. But when we consider the tradition in connection with the fact that the Sinhalese invariably admit the Vedd\u00e1s to be of the highest caste, while they in turn affect to look down upon the Sinhalese; and when we regard the custom in connection with the story of the marriage of the son and daughter of Vijayo, himself the offspring of a similar connection; when we read the legend of their flight from both father's and mother's kindred to the forests, where, resuming the wild life of their maternal ancestors, they founded a wild race; when we find even yet the district which tradition gives as their refuge, still called by a name indicative of their former existence in it, and still abounding with traces of them\u2014though not a Vedd\u00e1 can be remembered there; and when we can trace among the Vedd\u00e1s of the present day the remains of Br\u00e1hmanism\u2014Vijayo's creed\u2014intermingled with the N\u00e1t worship, practised by Kuv\u00e9ni's nation; and when there are still in use among them names of Sanskrit affinity, common in India, though, rare among themselves, unknown in Ceylon;\n\n* I. e., that she has been robbed of the blueness of her own plumage by the peacock's feathers tied up with their hair.\nit is impossible to resist the conclusion that the wild tribes of the Vedd\u00e1s are not the mere remnants of the untamed aborigines, but the descendants of the ill-fated Kuv\u00e9ni and the faithless Vijayo; that they are indeed, as they profess themselves, 'the descendants of Kings.'\u201d\u2014J. B.\n\n\"The Kandyans universally agree that they [Vedd\u00e1s] all belong to the royal caste, and it is said that they used to address the king by the now obsolete title 'H\u00far\u00e1,' or 'cousin,' the term which they applied to myself in conversation.\"*\u2014B.

They are repeated by rote; they do not pause to understand them, and could not if they would. It is enough for them, as for most Oriental people, that a particular formula is to serve a particular purpose. These [charms] are identical; yet the Vedd\u00e1s and the Singhalese certainly do not associate so closely as to borrow one another's charms. Have they descended in each race since the time they were one? The term okma I can get no satisfactory explanation of. It is not Singhalese certainly. I assume it means 'wild boar,' as this is the charm to arrest a boar in the path; but it is not the term used by the Vedd\u00e1s for a boar in ordinary conversation. The allusion to the Pas\u00e9, or Pach\u00e9, Buddha, is curious as occurring in both; the one people being anything but Buddhists, while Buddhism is the religion of the others. As Gautama Buddha visited Ceylon long anterior to the final establishment of Buddhism in Ceylon, and descended in Bintenna, may not this solitary allusion to the religion have been handed down in this form among the Vedd\u00e1s from a period even before the invasion by Vijayo? In the form of a charm which is repeated by rote, such an allusion would be most naturally retained.\"\nSo far as having any Buddhist tendencies, they do not even show the slightest outward respect in the presence of a Buddhist priest. The other Vedd\u00e1 charms are, I believe, quite unlike those of the Sinhalese.\"\u2014Hon. Sec.]\n\nNo. 9.\n\nI have found this mantra or charm in a collection of Vedd\u00e1 songs and charms I procured at Badulla. The use in it, however, of a Hind\u00fa-religious term, and the corrupted form of a Buddhist metaphysical term, may raise a doubt whether this charm be a genuine Vedd\u00e1 production or not.\n\nThe Hind\u00fa term alluded to is Om nam\u00f3!\u2014\"Salutation to the triune deity!\" The following is the explanation given of this term by Wilson in his Sanskrit Dictionary:\n\n'O'm.\u2014The mystic name of the deity, prefiguring all the prayers and most of the writings of the Hindus: A., a name of Vish\u1e47u, U., of \u015aiva, and M. of Br\u0101hma. It therefore implies the Indian triad, and expresses the three in one.' The Buddhist term is \u0905\u0919\u094d\u0917\u093f\u0915\u093e\u0930\u0923 [chhandachkande], which is a corruption of the Sinhalese word \u092a\u093e\u0923\u094d\u0921\u0915\u0902\u0921\u0947 [pandaskande], which again is corrupted from the Sanskrit or Sinhalese word \u092a\u093e\u091e\u094d\u091a\u0915\u0902\u0921 [pa\u00f1chaskandha], 'the five constituent parts of the human body.' These terms may have been interpolated by the village Vedd\u00e1s, or more probably by their neighbours, the Kandyan Sinhalese, but the contents of the charm are peculiarly Vedic\u2014if I may use the term\u2014and the interesting information it gives of the seats or localities of the various Vedd\u00e1 demons or chieftains throughout the Island is unique, and is not now procurable from any other source.\n\nThe mantra also seems to afford information which may possibly enable us to settle a long-disputed point in the early history of Ceylon, namely, as to whence the aborigines (Yakkhos or demons of the Mah\u00e1wapso, who are doubtless the ancestors of the Vedd\u00e1s) came to Ceylon.\n\nIt will be seen that the Vedd\u00e1 demons are called here \u0915\u093e\u0926\u0935\u0930\u093e [Ka\u1e0davara Vedi ch\u00e9n\u00e1va]. I cannot find the meaning of the word Ka\u1e0davara, but the expression shows that they are identical\nwith the Vedd\u00e1s (Vedd\u00f3). It is well known that there is a tribe of demons called Ka\u1e0davara Yakku, \"Ka\u1e0davara demons,\" to whom offerings are made in some parts of the Kandyan country. If the songs and prayers (y\u00e1dini or kannalav), used by the Ka\u1e0davara devil-dancers, are examined (which I have no means of doing at present), I have no doubt they will throw light on the early history of the Yakkhos, or Vedd\u00e1s, and probably lead to very important ethnological results. Again, \"nine millions, nine millions\" (a vast number) of these Ka\u1e0davara or Vedi demons are said to reside in a \"far distant land beyond the seas,\" in a country called Mallava d\u00e9sa, possibly a corruption of Malaya d\u00e9sa, the 'hilly country.'\n\nDoes not this show that the Vedd\u00e1s of Ceylon have a faint tradition that their fatherland is the \"hill country\" of India?\n\nI may here mention a curious legend related in the R\u00e1j\u00e1vali and Kuv\u00e9ni Asna (a little work on the history of Kuv\u00e9ni, in Sinhalese blank verse), which seems to have some connection with the history of the Vedd\u00e1s. Panduv\u00e1sa (B.C. 504), nephew of Vijayo, and third in succession to him, became ill with a combination of diseases, \"cough, asthma, fever, burning, rheumatism, &c.,\" the result of perjury committed by his uncle, Vijayo, who swore that he would not renounce Kuv\u00e9ni, the aboriginal Princess whom he first married, but afterwards violated his oath, by repudiating her and marrying a princess from Southern India. When the King was afflicted with this disease, Sakra, King of the gods, (Indra of the Hind\u00fa mythology) ordered the R\u00e1hu, the Asura (the ascending node) to assume the form of a wild boar, in size like a huge mountain, and devastate the pleasure garden of the King of Malaya (the hill-country in India), who was versed in all the arts of necromancy. When King Malaya saw the destruction of his pleasure garden, he pursued the boar with bow and arrow, accompanied by his three brothers and a retinue of archers or Vedd\u00e1s, through the continent of India. The boar crossed over the sea near Tuticorin and made the circuit of the Island, followed by the King, and when it reached the vicinity of Anur\u00e1dhapura, the boar was turned into a mountain! The King of gods then appeared to Malaya R\u00e1j\u00e1, and conducting him to King\nPanduvas, got him to perform certain demon ceremonies, and restored the king to his wonted health.\u2014L. De Z.\n\n[Since writing the above I have seen some of the songs used by the Ka\u1e0davara devil dancers, which not only confirm the identity of the Ka\u1e0davara demons and the Vedd\u00e1s, but also in a remarkable manner strengthen the opinion I have ventured to express, that the legend of the Malaya Raja is connected with the history of the Vedd\u00e1s. It is stated in these songs that Malaya R\u00e9j\u00e1 on his visit to Ceylon was accompanied by 2,000 Vedd\u00e1s, and when he performed the devil ceremonies for the King, 36 Vedd\u00e1s stood around him assisting at the ceremonies.\u2014L. De Z.]\n\n\"The result of the most patient enquiry is, that the Vedd\u00e1s have a vague belief in a host of undefined spirits, whose influence is rather for good than for evil. Still, vague as this belief is, not even the wildest Vedd\u00e1s are without 'an instinct of worship.' They believe that the air is peopled by spirits, that every rock and every tree, every forest and every hill\u2014in short, every feature of nature\u2014has its genius loci, but these seem little else than mere nameless phantoms, whom they regard rather with mysterious awe than actual dread. But besides this vague spirit-worship, they have a more definite superstition, in which there is more of system. This is the belief in the guardianship of the spirits of the dead. Every near relative becomes a spirit after death, who watches over the welfare of those who are left behind. These, which include their ancestors and their children, they term their n\u00e9hiya yakun, 'kindred spirits.' They describe them as 'ever watchful, coming to them in sickness, visiting them in dreams, giving them flesh when hunting.' In short, in every calamity, in every want, they call on them for aid, and it is curious that the shades of their departed children, bilindu yakun, or 'infant spirits,' as they call them, are those which they appear most frequently to invoke.\n\n\"It is a pretty belief, and contrasts favourably with the superstitions of the Kandyans, who have spirits enough in their system, but almost all thoroughly malignant, and needing constant propitiation. But the Vedd\u00e1 spirit-world is singularly free from evil. I can find only one absolutely malignant spirit in it, whom they really fear, though,\nlike all savages, they have an undefined awe of the nameless spirits whom they believe to haunt the darkness. The shades of their ancestors and of their children seem to be purely benevolent. The ceremonies with which they invoke them are few as they are simple. The most common is the following. An arrow is fixed upright in the ground, and the Vedd\u00e1 dances slowly round it, chanting this invocation, which is almost musical in its rhythm:\n\n\"M\u00e1 miya m\u00e1 miya m\u00e1 d\u00e9y\u00e1\nTopang koyih\u00e9ti mitigan yanda,\"\n\"My departed one, my departed one, my God!\nWhere art thou wandering?\"\n\n\"The spirit of the dead is here simply called upon, without even the object for which it is invoked being mentioned. And this invocation appears to be used on all occasions when the intervention of the guardian spirits is required,\u2014in sickness, preparatory to hunting, &c.\n\n\"Sometimes, in the latter case, a portion of the flesh of the game is promised as a votive offering in the event of the chase being successful, and they believe that the spirits will appear to them in dreams, and tell them where to hunt.\n\n\"Sometimes they cook food and place it in the dry bed of a river, or some other secluded spot, and then call on their deceased ancestors by name: 'Come, and partake of this! Give us maintenance as you did when living! Come, wheresoever you may be; on a tree, on a rock, in the forest, come!' And they dance round the food, half chanting, half shouting, the invocation...........\n\n\"They have no system of medicine, though they will accept medicine when given. In cases of sickness, they sprinkle water on the patient, invoking their deceased ancestors to heal him. Sometimes they simply utter the names of spirits as they dance round the sick man. Sometimes a garland of flowers is offered to the spirit who has afflicted him.\n\n\"They invoke the Gal-yak\u00e1, 'spirit of the rock'; Vedi-yak\u00e1, 'spirit of the chase'; Unap\u00e1na-yak\u00e1, of whom I have no knowledge;\"\nand the shade of their grandmother. They also propitiate Mah\u00e1-yakinnti, who appears rather an evil personage. It is to her that they offer a garland of flowers. They describe her as a 'foreigner' and say that they know nothing about her, but acquired their awe of her from the Sinhalese.\n\n\"The Vedi-yaka is known to the Sinhalese; hunters offer flowers, blood, and burnt meat to this spirit, before hunting, to secure their success. Unap\u00e1na-yaka is known to the Sinhalese of the V\u00e9dira\u1e6da, but I do not think he is generally known to the Sinhalese.\n\n\"They believe in the efficacy of what are called devil-dancers, but are ignorant of the art of a Ka\u1e6d\u1e6d\u00e1diya, or devil-dancer.\"\u2014J. B.\nA H\u00daNIYAM IMAGE.\n\nBy L. NELL, Esq.\n\n(Read July 6th, 1881.)\n\nLong residence amongst the native Sinhalese and careful observation of their superstitious practices and expressions of superstitious ideas lead to the conclusion that, amongst the lower castes, who have also hitherto been the most ignorant, Buddhism has not existed as a religion. The tom-tom beaters, the toddy-drawers, the jaggery-makers, have only lately attempted to build Buddhist temples of their own. The Amarapura sect of Buddhists is a modern importation to satisfy the social ambition of the Mahabadd\u00e9 people, candidates of whose community for priestly ordination would have been refused by the previously existing Siamese sect. The latter, though heterodox in this exclusiveness, had confined the right of ordination to pupils drawn from the Goyigama caste.\n\nThe liberal and orthodox principle of the Amarapura sect extended in time from the Mahabadd\u00e9 and Kar\u00e1v\u00e9 to lower castes. As an instance, the jaggery people (Vahumpura) near Galle have built a temple, and their pupil-priests in yellow robes and with begging-bowls in their hands are now seen obtaining the food of mendicants from the hands of their own friends. The profound meditative air of the young mendicants, and the evident pride with which their friends give alms and honor the new priesthood are very striking. This is quite a reform, and Buddhism, perhaps for the first time, is subverting what other missions have not hitherto observed as a likely field of conversion. Before this reform the priests of the very low castes have been the Yakadur\u00e1s, commonly called Kat\u1e6d\u0101diy\u00e1s, belonging to the tom-tom beater and Oliya castes. Kapur\u00e1las belong to all castes, and Pattinis also belong to all castes.\nThese remarks apply to the practice of Kapur\u00e1las. The priests undergo a training\u2014which, if they have a good memory, is of not long duration\u2014namely, the committing to memory of certain charms, invocations, and songs to be accompanied on the tom-tom, drum, and by violent dances. One must live in the neighbourhood of these devil-worshippers to appreciate the form of nuisance known as a 'devil-ceremony.' The tom-tom is beaten violently to accompany the discordant song, and the noises are very violent during the intervals of dancing. The family having the ceremony keep it up from sunset till past dawn the next morning. If any remonstrance is used with respect to such practices, they will excuse themselves on the ground that it is their \"religion\" or \"faith.\" But the Yakadur\u00e1s are in no way respected for being priests, and their remuneration is very little.\n\nBesides the performance of these devil-dances the Yakadur\u00e1s practise H\u00faniyam charms,* by which harm\u2014such as disease\u2014is inflicted on one's fellow-creatures. To counteract H\u00faniyam charms counter-charms\u2020 are muttered over a cup of oil or a thread, and three limes are cut with an arecanut-cutter whilst charms are muttered.\u00a7 The failure of such counter-charms strengthens the belief in the potency of the H\u00faniyam. In most of these H\u00faniyam charms a small image, made of wax or wood or drawn on a leaf, is necessary. Nails made of five metals\u00a7 (usually gold, silver, copper, tin, and lead) are driven\n\n* \"Kodivina [\u03ba\u03bf\u03b4\u03b9\u03b2\u03af\u03bd\u03b1] or H\u00faniyam [\u03c7\u03bf\u03bd\u03b9\u03ac\u03bc] is the name given to evils of whatever kind inflicted by the agency of charms......There are said to be 84,000 [H\u00faniyam charms] of every degree of malignity, most of which more or less contribute to bring to an untimely death the person affected by this influence, though that event may be deferred for many years.

These images, after the process of charming, are buried under a stile so that the intended victim may pass over it* and be thus affected. This \"passing over\" of the buried image is generally indispensable. After the charms have taken effect, the image is otherwise secreted.*\n\nThe image I now send was found in the trunk of a *Rukattana* tree.\u2020 An oblong hole corresponding in shape to the tin box holding the image had been neatly cut into the trunk of the tree in a direction S.S.W., and about two feet high from the ground. The box containing the image had been inserted inside this hole and a tin plate, covering the hole, neatly nailed over with copper nails.\u00a7 It is of course absurd to suppose that this contrivance could have had any effect, but should the intended victim have met with an accident or stroke of disease, there would have been another instance of the potency of the *Huniyam*.\n\nIn the Society's Journal for 1865-66 will be found an exhaustive treatise on \"Sinhalese Demonology\" by Dandris De Silva, Mudaliyar. This short introductory sketch is only intended to introduce the *Huniyam* image now sent, which is interesting as a specimen of one which had been actually uttered with malicious intent. When discovered it had evidently been long imbedded in the tree, and unless the particular *Yakadur\u00e1* who performed the devil-ceremony in this instance will volunteer a confession, no further light will be thrown upon the subject.\n\n---\n\n* Pannavanav\u00e1 [\u092a\u0928\u094d\u0928\u0935\u093e\u0928\u0935\u093e].

This Huniyam image may therefore possibly have been made by a native of the Maldives, many of whom live near the neighbourhood where the image was discovered, though this is unlikely. This is one of the many points of resemblance between the low-country Sinhalese and Maldivians.*\n\nNOTE.\n\n[The Maldive Islanders\u2014particularly those living on the Southernmost Atols, Huvad\u00fa (Suv\u00e1diva) and Ad\u00fa, which have been least affected by foreign influence\u2014retain to this day the character of being \"great necromancers,\"\u2020 as old Duarte Barbosa (A.D. 1501\u201317) described them three and a half centuries ago, and as the captive Frenchman Pyrard found them a century later (A.D. 1602\u20137).\u2021\n\nThe difficulty all the world over of eradicating long-established customs and deeply-rooted beliefs\u2014more especially when these enter into the exigencies of every-day life\u2014is an accepted fact, confirmed by the experience of ages.\n\n* At Mr. Nell's request a brief note is added with the intention of partially illustrating the similarity between the superstitious practices of the Sinhalese and Maldivians.

T. Shams-ud-Di'n.\n\n(Read October 6th, 1881.)\n\nThis feast is annually held in Colombo at the Marad\u00e1na Mosque during Jam\u00e1d-ul-\u00e1khir, the sixth month of the Muhammadan year, in memory of the saint M\u00edr\u00e1 S\u00e1hib, whose miracles are well known to the Muhammadans, and whom they esteem as a great Wali.* His sepulchre is at N\u00e1g\u00far, near N\u00e1gapatam.\n\nThe festival\u2020 commences on the evening the new moon becomes visible in the month of Jam\u00e1d-ul-\u00e1khir, and lasts till the tenth of the lunar month. Five or six days previous to the new moon they erect a flag-staff, and in the evening of the new moon day the sacred banners are conveyed in solemn procession, attended by a ceremonious display of music, artificial trees, &c. After having perambulated the town in great pomp and state, the procession returns to the place where the flag-staff is erected. There the F\u00e1thihah or opening chapter of the Kur\u00e1n is recited in the name of the saint, and the sacred flag is hoisted.\n\nIn other parts of the Muhammadan world also, as at N\u00e1g\u00far, those Musalm\u00e1ns who venerate this saint set up a flagstaff and annually repeat the F\u00e1thihah in his name. On the night of the 10th a great feast is held on account of its being the day that the saint departed this life. The Mosque is illuminated and all kinds of sports take place, which attract crowds of people\n\n* \"The favourite of heaven.\"\n\u2020 Regarding these annual festivals (M\u00f3lids) held in commemoration of the birth of Muslim Saints, see Lane's Arabian Nights, Vol., I., Chap. iii., Note 63, p. 216.\u2014Hon. Sec.\nto the spot. In short, the whole town is awake that night, and presents a scene of bustle and confusion. The slow murmur of human voices rising at times like the waves of the ocean, and mingling with the clear voices of the ubiquitous sherbert vendor and roasted gram seller\u2014the invariable concomitants of a Ceylon crowd\u2014renders the scene perfectly picturesque. Moreover a k\u016bdu is constructed in honour of this saint. This is a frame-work of bamboo, in the shape of a pagoda, made with a sort of network of paper nicely clipped and pasted on it. It is further ornamented with different kinds of coloured paper, formed into various devices, tinsel fringes, &c. When the whole is lighted up within and without, it has a beautiful appearance.\n\nThe Musalm\u00e1n ship captains and sailors are in the habit of making vows and oblations in the name of this saint; e.g., when they meet with any misfortune at sea, they vow that should the vessel reach the desired haven in peace, safely with their property and cargo, they will spend a certain sum of money in offering F\u0101thihah to him.*\n\nThere is a tradition in general reception among the Moors, that in former times the inhabitants of the M\u00e1ldives were tormented by a demon, to whom they were compelled to sacrifice a female every year; but this saint, a descendant of the prophet, having arrived in the Island, attacked and overcame the demon, and that in return for this service the whole of the inhabitants\n\n* \"Before a voyage is undertaken, an offering is made to some saint for success, and in danger or distress the mariners trust chiefly in the efficacy of vows or offerings to the tombs of some personage (dead or living) eminent for piety. We are informed of large sums given as votive offerings made during boisterous weather to an old priest resident at Calcutta. All moneys paid at M\u00e1l\u00e9 in fulfilment of such vows go to the priest.\" (Christopher and Young, Memoir on the M\u00e1ldiv\u00e9 Islanders, Trans. Bombay Geo. Soc. 1836-8, p. 75.)\u2014Hon.

The miracles performed by this saint were innumerable.\n\nNOTE.\n\n[According to a Tamil version of an Arabic biography of this saint,* M\u00edr\u00e1 S\u00e1h\u00edb was born at \"M\u00e1\u0144ikkapuri\" on the 9th Jam\u00e1d-ul-\u00e1kh\u00edr, A. H. 910 (A. D. 1504), and died on the 10th of the same month, A. H. 978 (A. D. 1570). He is known to his votaries under several names, e.g., Hazrat M\u00edr\u00e1 S\u00e1h\u00edb, Shaikh 'Abd-ul-K\u00e1dir, S\u00e1ul Ham\u00edd, &c.\n\nAmong the miraculous adventures attributed to the Shaikh is included a visit to the M\u00e1ldives, where, after thwarting the treachery of the King and his subjects, he was enabled to win them over to Isl\u00e1m by ridding the Islands of a dreaded Jinni.\u2020\n\nIt should be noted, however, that the account of this conversion, though sufficiently quaint to warrant its insertion here in extenso, is manifestly nothing more than the plain unvarnished legend related by the Arab traveller Ibn Bat\u00fat\u00e1, as then (circa A. D. 1344) current among the Islanders\u2021 popularised and assimilated to the familiar Arabian Nights' Tale of the Fisherman, the 'Ifr\u00edt, and the bottle of brass.\n\n* Kalarattu Mir\u00e1n S\u00e1kipu A'ndavaravarka\u0144 h\u00e1ra\u0144a-sarittiram, K\u00e1raikk\u00e1l, A.

Perceiving that the sea was boisterous and having a mind to visit M\u00e1l\u0111ive Island, (the Shaikh,) after meditating upon God and performing the prayers of two *raka't,* looked at Hazrat Y\u00fasuf S\u00e1hib and the others, and said: \"Shut ye your eyes, and placing your feet in the salt sea follow me.\" The S\u00e1hib\u2014exclaiming 'In the name of God!'\u2014first set his lotus-like feet in the water and walked, the others following him. Before the twinkling of an eye the Shaikh with his holy\u2020 mouth commanded the devotees to open their eyes. When they looked and saw that they were on the shore of M\u00e1l\u0111ive Island they rejoiced exceedingly. But the Ruler of that country and the other infidels,\u00a7 seeing Hazrat S\u00e1hib come with a company, spoke one with another: \"They are come to make war on our land\"; and, intending to kill them by stratagem, introduced deadly poisons into fruits and other eatables. Taking these, the King and the rest of the inhabitants approached Hazrat S\u00e1hib with great respect, as though they had come to welcome them, and set before them the poisoned viands they had brought. But the S\u00e1hib\u2014although cognizant (of their treachery)\u2014feigning ignorance, saying 'In the name of God!' and laying his holy hands on the food, ate it, and handing to the others they too ate and rejoiced.

Some hold that the Devils (Shait\u00e1ns) are distinct from Angels and Jinn. The species of Jinn (said to have been created some thousand years before Adam) consists, according to tradition, of five orders:\u20141. Jann; 2. Jinn; 3. Shait\u00e1n; 4. 'Ifrit; 5. M\u00e1rid\u2014the most powerful. There are good and evil Genii. If good, they are exceedingly handsome: if evil, horribly hideous. At pleasure they become invisible, or disappear in earth or air; and appear to mankind commonly in the shapes of serpents, dogs, cats, or giants. Their chief abode is said to be in the mountains of K\u00e1f, which encircle the earth.

This custom has obtained from the time of our ancestors. We therefore give our maidens by turns. As it is now this girl's turn, we have come here and are preparing to take her away.\" Hazrat, looking on the infidels, forbade them, saying, \"Do not this wicked act, but marry ye the maid to a young man,\" and went away.\n\nBut those infidels disregarded the righteous words of the S\u00e1hib, being quite ignorant of his previous miraculous acts. According to their wont they adorned the girl, bound her tightly, and having placed her in a palanquin paraded her through the country with music and lighted torches\u2020; finally, leaving her in the temple which is outside the town, they departed to their respective houses.\n\nHazrat M\u00edr\u00e1n S\u00e1hib, aware of these circumstances by divine intuition, meditating on the wonderful God, in the dread night took a goglet joyfully in his hand, and walked alone to the place where the girl was kept.\u00a7 At that juncture the Jinn\u00ed approached with fearful noise, coming to gaze on the maid. M\u00edr\u00e1n Ham\u00edd seeing him said, \"O Shait\u00e1n, be patient; approach not the girl.\" Hearing those words the Jinn\u00ed, alarmed, confused in mind, trembling, with face distorted, made obeisance at the lotus feet of the S\u00e1hib.\u00a7 Hazrat looking on the Jinn\u00ed said \"Take this goglet, O Accursed,|| and fetch water from the tank which is opposite.\" The Jinn\u00ed, at once assuming human shape, took\n\n* \"There appeared to them every month an evil spirit, who came from the sea, resembling a ship filled with lamps.\" (Gray, J.

But when he dipped the goglet to draw water, all the water of the tank flowed into it. Perceiving this the Jinn\u00ed was filled with wonder, because the goglet did not come with his hand nor yield in the least though he lifted it with all his might. While the Jinn\u00ed was standing with diminished strength without releasing his hold on the goglet, the Islanders, taking their waterpots as usual and going to the tank to draw water at the third watch, seeing the tank dry and the Jinn\u00ed in human form standing tugging at the goglet, stood terrified. Because the goglet did not yield, although he tried his utmost to lift it, the Jinn\u00ed returned to the holy presence of Hazrat and informed him of what had happened. \"Go, Shait\u00e1n,\" said the Shaikh, \"and say our (Muslim) 'Bismill\u00e1h' ('In the name of God!'), and the water in the goglet will run out; again say 'Bismill\u00e1h,' draw water and come.\" The Jinn\u00ed went, did as directed, and bringing water placed it before Hazrat, who took it and made his ablutions.* The Jinn\u00ed, in his foolishness thinking 'I will enter the goglet and see the wonder inside,' as soon as the S\u00e1hib had finished, said \"Master, be pleased to allow me to enter this goglet.\" As Hazrat said \"Well, enter,\" the Jinn\u00ed contracted his body and crept into the goglet.\u2020 Whilst the Shaikh, having clapped on the stopper, was performing his prayers \u2021 those Islanders, as usual, brought the requisites for taking away the corpse. But when they saw the girl alive, as left the night before, they were astonished, approached her and asked what had occurred.

The Islanders, rejoicing exceedingly, with gladdened minds untied the bonds of the girl, and taking her with them worshipped the golden feet of the bountiful benefactor who abounded in the favour of the wonderful God; then very hastily went and narrated the circumstances to the King of the Island. He, rejoicing when he heard, surrounded by his ministers, other chief men, astrologers, and merchants, came quickly on foot, and seeing the Shaikh, worshipped him, saying \"O lord who hast removed the danger that threatened us, be pleased to save us: we are come under thy protection: we will without fail perform whatever thou commandest.\" Hazrat M\u00edr\u00e1n S\u00e1hib, having fed that King and all his subjects with the divine ambrosia called Kalimah, caused them to come into the right way,* and, having broken down all the temples in the Island, built mosques. Looking at that King he said, \"Do thou reign alone and be a help to thy subjects\"; (then) blessed them, and abode (there) a few days.\u2020 The King and the other inhabitants, however, came to the S\u00e1hib and said \"O lord, the fear of the harm he will work in the future distresses our minds, should we keep our enemy the Jinn\u00ed here thus; we will do whatever thou biddest us.\" Hazrat replied, \"Load the goglet in which the Jinn\u00ed is enclosed in a gundara,\u2021 and having taken and sunk it (in the sea) beyond Galle.\u00a7 return.\" But those people said\n\n* \"When any one is converted to Isl\u00e1m he is required to repeat the Kalimah, or Creed:\u2014La-il\u00e1h\u00e1-il-lal-laho Muhammad-ur-Ras\u00fal-Ullah.

C. P. B., Hon. Sec.]\nSERICULTURE IN CEYLON.\n\nBy J. L. Vanderstraaten, M.D.\n\n(Read October 6th, 1881.)\n\nSericulture, or, the raising of silk-worms, is derived from Seres, 'Chinese,' and cultura, 'culture,' because \"silk\" came from the Chinese word Se, which signifies 'silk.' The name, therefore, of the great Empire of China derives its name from the great silk industry. The discovery of the uses to which the cocoon of the silk-worm might be applied appears to have been first made in China by an Empress, who was the first to unravel the filmy thread, and to work it into a web of cloth, about 2,700 years before the Christian era.\n\nIn the middle of the 6th century, the Western world received the great boon of a supply of silk-worms' eggs. These were secretly conveyed from Semida, between Tartary and China, to Constantinople, by two Persian monks, who concealed the eggs in a hollow cane. At the proper season they were hatched, and the caterpillars were fed with the leaves of the wild mulberry tree. From this small commencement the myriads of silk worms have sprung, which, throughout Europe and Western Asia, have met the continual demand for silk. The introduction of silk into Europe occurred about the year A.D. 552, in the reign of Justinian, and we find from Tennent's History of Ceylon, (Vol. I., p. 569) that the earliest record made of the introduction of silk into the Island of Ceylon, was in the reign of Justinian, by Cosmas, an Egyptian merchant, who published the narrative of Sopater, a Greek trader, whom he had met at Adule in Ethiopia, when on his return from Ceylon. Sopater told Cosmas that, from China and other emporia, silk and other articles named by him were imported into Ceylon.\nI have searched for information on the subject of Sericulture, or silk, in all the works relating to Ceylon that I could find in the Library of this Society, and in the Colombo and Colonial Medical Libraries. I have looked into Bald\u00e6us, Knox, Valentyn, Percival, Cordiner, Davy, Lee\u2019s translation of Ribeyro, Marshall, Forbes, Knighton, Pridham, Hoffmeister and Tennent, but I have only been able to glean the following scanty information on these subjects.\n\nIn Valentyn\u2019s History, published in 1663, there is the following reference to Sericulture:\u2014\u201cIn Jaffnapatam experiments are made to nourish the silk-worm, and obtain by it a source of livelihood. Mulberry trees have been planted here and in many other places, and they appear to thrive well. In January and February the worms are transported from Jaffna, and other small insects can be collected here. These are occupations which are interesting, and can be undertaken with little pains and at small cost.\u201d\n\nI find from the Appendix to Lee\u2019s translation of Ribeyro\u2019s History of Ceylon, that in March, 1740, the Governor Baron Van Imhoff left the following memorandum on silk for the information of his successor:\n\n\u201cSilk has not been so successful as we anticipated when we began to grow it here.\u201d\n\nIn 1849, Pridham mentions (Vol. I., p. 374) that \u201con account of the dryness of the Northern Province, the culture of the mulberry plant might be almost indefinitely extended by the introduction of the silk-worm, and silk be rendered one of its leading staples, instead of being, as is now the case, completely neglected. The mode of culture practised in Hindostan, as being the most simple, will be at first the best-adapted for the native agriculturist, who has to acquire skill and practice ere he can be expected to improve upon Oriental methods. Much depends upon the abundance of cooly labour, which may be further cheapened by employing children to\nprepare and lay down the sets as soon as the nurseries of the mulberry plant are sufficiently stocked to admit of the operations of the planter.\"\n\nFrom Sir J. E. Tennent's \"Natural History of Ceylon\" I have obtained the following description of the Silk Moths found here:\n\n\"Among the strictly nocturnal Lepidoptera are some gigantic species. Of these, the cinnamon-eating Atlas often attains the dimensions of nearly a foot in the stretch of its superior wings. It is very common in the gardens about Colombo, and its size, and the transparent talc-like spots in its wings, cannot fail to strike even the most careless saunterer. But little inferior to it in size is the famed Tusseh silk-moth [Anther\u00e6a mylitta, Drury,] which feeds on the country almond (Terminalia catappa) and the palma christi or castor-oil plant; it is easily distinguishable from the Atlas, which has a triangular wing, whilst its is falcated, and the transparent spots are covered with a curious thread-like division drawn across them.\n\nTowards the Northern portions of the Island this valuable species entirely displaces the other, owing to the fact that the almond and palma christi abound there. The latter plant springs up spontaneously on every manure-heap or neglected spot of ground; and might be cultivated, as in India, with great advantage\u2014the leaf to be used as food for the caterpillar, the stalk as fodder for cattle, and the seed for expression of castor oil. The Dutch took advantage of this facility, and gave every encouragement to the cultivation of silk at Jaffna.\n\nThe Portuguese had made the attempt previous to the arrival of the Dutch, and a strip of land on the banks of the Kelan\u00ee river, near Colombo, still bears the name of Orta Seda, the silk garden. The attempt of the Dutch to introduce the true silk worm, the Bombyx mori, took place under the Governorship of\nRyckloff Van Goens, who, on handing over the administration to his successor, in 1663, thus apprises him of the imitation of the experiment:\u2014'At Jaffna Palace a trial has been undertaken to feed silk-worms, and to ascertain whether silk may be reared at that station. I have planted a quantity of mulberry trees, which grow well there, and they ought to be planted in other directions.'\u2014Valentyn, chap. xiii. The growth of the mulberry tree is noticed the year after in a report to the Governor-General of India, but the subject afterwards ceased to be attended to; but it never attained such a development as to become an article of commercial importance.\n\nCeylon now cultivates no silk-worms whatever, notwithstanding this abundance of the favourite food of one species; and the rich silken robes sometimes worn by the Buddhist priesthood, are imported from China and the Continent of India.\n\nIn addition to the Atlas moth and the Mylitta, there are many other Bombycidae in Ceylon; and though the silk of some of them, were it susceptible of being unwound from the cocoon, would not bear a comparison with that of the Bombyx mori, or even of the Tusseh moth, it might still prove to be valuable when carded and spun. If the European residents in the Colony would rear the larv\u00e6 of these lepidoptera, and make drawings of their various changes, they would render a possible service to commerce and a certain one to entomological knowledge.\n\nIn connection with the subject of Sericulture in Ceylon, I have obtained the permission of the Revd. Father Palla, of Galle, to illustrate my paper by the exhibition of a card of silk-worm eggs as originally received from Japan, through Government, in December last.\n\nIn November, 1879, the Rev. Father Palla applied to His Excellency the Governor, Sir J. R. Longden, to use his influence\nin obtaining a supply of eggs from China or Japan. In a few days he received the gratifying information that His Excellency would have much pleasure in applying to the Consul-General of Japan for a supply of eggs.\n\nIn January, 1880, a communication was received by Government from Her Majesty's Consul-General at Yeddo, in Japan, that it was too late in the season to forward any eggs then as they had almost all been exported, but that a supply would be sent in the next season.\n\nIn December, 1880, the first supply was received by Government from Yeddo, and at once handed to Father Palla, who distributed a few cards to some friends who had previously begun the cultivation of the mulberry plant in anticipation of the arrival of the eggs.\n\nThe eggs, which are as small as grains of mustard, as laid by the insect on white cards, (each 14 by 9 inches long,) cover the whole card, so that there are thousands of eggs on each card. The one I now exhibit has been practically hatched and bears the empty shells as well as those which have not hatched as yet. The cards have certain Japanese impressions on them to prove that they are genuine Japanese silk-worm eggs.\n\nThere were several cards, each being covered with tissue paper, and then wrapped in thick covers of China and brown paper. There was also a little box with 100 divisions, numbered; in each division there were six cocoons. The numbers on the divisions corresponded with the numbers on the cards, and the quality of the cocoons and silk, which each card was capable of producing, could be ascertained by reference to these numbers.\n\nThe eggs which were received in December began to hatch in a few days after they were exposed to the air in a ventilated room. It required a magnifying glass to enable one to see the minute caterpillars or larv\u00e6 which were hatched, and these\nhad to be carefully removed and kept in little paper boxes containing tender mulberry leaves. They began to grow rapidly and increase in size, as can be judged from the specimens now exhibited, containing caterpillars of different stages of growth.*\n\n**Indian Species**\n\nDescribed by Captain Thomas Hutton, F.G.S., C.M.Z.S., Corresponding Member of the Agri-Horticultural Society of India.\u2020\n\nWild species of India differ widely in form, habits, food, and silk from the Bombyces proper; they are all wild and indigenous to India and widely diffused wherever there are hills. The type of this group is the well-known *Tussar* or *Tusseh moth* (*Antheraea paphia*) which is found along the coast line from Bombay through Pondicherry and eastward to Bengal, and thence through Cachar, Assam, Darjiling, and even to the Punjab.\n\nWhen left to nature, in a wild state, they are annual or single-brooded; but when domesticated, two to five broods a year may be obtained.\n\nIn the whole family of the Lepidoptera there is no insect so variable in the imago state in point of colouring as the Tussar species, so that a novice would scarcely believe the varieties to be of one species.\n\nThe *Actias selene*, others of that genus, and the *Antheraea*, have a strong, sharp-pointed, horny spine at the shoulder of the wing, which is alternately brought into play in making a cross-cut, or in separating the threads without cutting, until the\n\n---\n\n* The card and other specimens exhibited at the Meeting can be seen at the De Soyza Museum, Ceylon Medical College, Colombo.\n\n\u2020 From the Journal of the Agricultural and Horticultural Society of India Vol. I. Part 4; New Series.\nmoth makes its exit from the cocoon. In *Actias* the cocoons are not so full of silk as those of *Antherea*, but it is \"strong, tenacious, elastic, and brilliant.\"\n\nOne species of wild silk-worm found in the N. W. Himalayas has been named after the writer alluded to, *Bombyx Huttoni*. It will not submit to domestication.\n\nThe other species are *Antherea assama*, found in Assam; *Antherea Roylei*, found in Mussoree and Simla feeding on the oak; and *Bombyx Mari a P\u00e1t Porloo*, found in Bengal.\n\nOf the *Eria*, *Erie*, *Arrea* or *Arindee* group *Phal\u00e6a cynthia*, found in Bengal, feeds on the castor oil plant instead of on the mulberry and yields a coarser silk.\n\nAnother of the *Eria* group is the *Attacus atlas*. It thrives well when found and taken from the jungle, but the moths could not be induced to breed. The *Attacus cynthia* is the same as the *Attacus canningi*, and is abundant in Mussorie and Cachar.\n\nThe above are also described as belonging to the genus \"Saturnia\"\u2014*Saturnia atlas*, 'the giant atlas moth' whose wings measure 7 or 8 inches across; *Saturnia cercropia* and *Saturnia luna* have their wings produced into a tail; *Saturnia cynthia* is the *arindi* silk-worm of India. Lattreille states that these are the wild species of silk worm of China. *Saturnia promethea* is a North American species. It forms its cocoon within the leaf of a sassafras tree, having previously fastened the stalk of the leaf to the stem by a strong silken web, whereby it is prevented from falling with the other leaves.\n\nWild silk-worms feed upon different trees, such as the jujube, *Ficus religiosa* or Peepul tree, the castor oil plant, the almond, some of the laurel tribe, and others. (*Royle's Productive Resources of India.*)\n\nAs Mr. Geddes of Moratuwa had a supply of silk-worm eggs from Father Palla I wrote to him for such information as he could give me. The following is his reply,\nwhich will be found full of interesting information on this subject:\n\nParate, Moratuwa,\nSeptember 29th, 1881.\n\nDear Sir,\u2014With reference to your request for specimens of the Mylitta silk moth, I regret that I have no moths at present, but only some larv\u00e6 of Mylitta and Atlas, which I am rearing for Mr. Alfred Wailly, of London. There must be specimens at the Museum.\n\nThere seem to be several varieties of the Mylitta. According to Major Coussmaker, the Himalayan variety is univoltine (single-brooded) and the larv\u00e6 casts the skin five times, and attains a length of seven inches when full grown. There are smaller varieties in other parts of India, and in the kind found here the larv\u00e6 moults four times and is about five inches long. In India the Mylitta feeds on the Terminalea tomentosa, Zizypus jujuba, Lagerstroemia indica, Ficus benjamina, Carissa, Guidia, and other trees. I do not know if any of these grow here. In this country the Mylitta is to be found on the kaju, kaha\u1e6da, milila, vera\u1e37u, and some other trees; and the Ceylonese variety of the insect is polyvoltine, producing four or five generations in a year. Sir Emerson Tennent says, in his Natural History, that the Mylitta feeds on the leaves of the castor oil tree, but he has confounded it with the Attacus ricini or Arinda silk worm, which is quite a different species and does not, so far as I know, exist in Ceylon.\n\nThe word tussur\u2014variously written \"tasar,\" \"tusseh,\" \"tussah,\" and several other ways\u2014is derived from tussurie, Hind\u00fast\u00e1n\u00ed for a shuttle.* In England they call all sorts of wild silk-worms by the general name of \"tussurs,\" but the name properly belongs to the species known scientifically\u2014or rather empirically, for such names have been multiplied until they have become worse than useless\u2014by the various names of Saturnia paphia, Anther\u00e6a paphia, Anther\u00e6a Mylitta and Attacus Mylitta.\n\nThe Mylitta silk-worm cannot be fed on plucked leaves like the mulberry and castor oil species, but must be kept either on growing\n\n* S. \u0dad\u0dc3\u0dbb [tasara], \"shuttle.\"\nthe leaves fresh. It has not hitherto been cultivated except by entomologists, all the tussur silk being made from wild cocoons gathered in the jungles. I have tried keeping the larv\u00e6 on exposed trees, but it did not answer, as they were all destroyed by birds, red ants, or lizards. Major Coussmaker keeps them on bushes covered with bamboo cages, and that plan might answer here; but I believe it would be too expensive a way of obtaining cocoons in sufficient quantity for manufacturing purposes. I keep mine on cut branches, and I have an arrangement by which they are transferred from exhausted branches to fresh ones with very little trouble. But this plan requires a plant that, after being cut and put in water, will not wither before the silk-worms have time to consume the leaves; and I have not yet found any plant that is perfectly satisfactory in that respect for feeding the Mylitta, though, in the case of the Atlas, the Milnea Roxburghiana answers perfectly. For the Mylitta I have used kahata, vera\u1e37u, and kaju, and I am now using ka\u1e6daka\u1e37u (Sinhalese for a common weed of which I do not know the botanical name). This plant seems to answer better than any I have tried before, but I have had very little experience of it yet. For keeping the branches for the silk-worms I have long tin cylinders placed horizontally and filled with water, and along the upper side of the cylinder there is a bar of wood pierced with holes for inserting the branches; but the plan is not easy to describe, though very simple when seen.\n\nThe culture of the tussur silkworm is only an experiment yet, and except as a matter of scientific investigation, it would be premature to give it any encouragement. Though a silk-worm be polyphagous in a state of nature, yet it does not follow that it has no proper food plant, and the proper food plant of the tussur\u2014if it has one\u2014is not yet known. Then there is no general market for tussur silk, because it is not a recognized commercial product as real silk is. Tussur silk may in future to a considerable extent supersede cotton, and it may also be largely used in combination with cotton and woollen yarn for improving fabrics both in appearance and durability, but it never can be a substitute for true silk. Those who are now giving attention to the artificial propagation of the tussur silk-worm may confer a service on future commerce and manufacturing industry, but they\ncannot expect to obtain from their experiments any pecuniary benefit for themselves. In the meantime the thing to be ascertained is the proper food plant of the tussur, for, as I said before, a silkworm's being polyphagous does not prove that it has not a proper tree on which it is more at home than any other. The Arinda silk-worm is polyphagous in a wild state, and yet it has for its proper food plant the castor oil tree. The Atlas is also more polyphagous than the tussur, and yet I know of no tree except the *Milnea Roxburghiana* on which it can be artificially reared for more than one generation; and while more than a hundred cocoons of the Atlas will be found on a single tree of this species, not more than two or three can be found on any other. I think the proper tree of the tussur must be an Indian species not indigenous to this country, because there does not seem to be any tree here on which the cocoons are to be found in such numbers as to be worth collecting for manufacturing purposes, as is done in India.\n\nIn the meantime the only silk industry likely to be commercially successful is the cultivation of the mulberry. Many persons when they first give their attention to silk production think that wild silk-worms must be more profitable than the mulberry species, but they always become converts to the mulberry in the end.\n\nYours truly,\n\n**Alex. T. Geddes.**\n\nP.S.\u2014The eggs of the tussur moth hatch in 8 days here. In a temperature of 70\u00b0 to 75\u00b0 Fah. they hatch in about fifteen, but they lose their vitality and become putrid if the hatching be delayed for more than twenty days. The breed can therefore be transported long distances only in the pupa state. I omitted to mention that the caterpillar, like that of the Atlas, has the habit of devouring its own cast off skin.\n\nI enclose a specimen of tussur silk and one of mulberry silk. The mulberry silk is the one tied with red thread.*\n\n* These can be seen at the \"De Soyza Museum,\" Colombo.\nSINHALESE OMENS.*\n\nBy S. JAYATILAKA, Mudaliy\u00e1r.\n\n(Read October 6th, 1881.)\n\nOMENS enter largely into the every-day life of the native of Ceylon. They exercise considerable influence in almost every remarkable occurrence or incident in his life\u2014the birth of a child, the marriage of a son or daughter, the undertaking of a journey or speculation, an illness or death in the family, and last but not least, the result of his favourite pastime, a lawsuit.\n\nOne of the peculiar characteristics in Ceylon of faith in omens is that this feeling, or fear, or belief\u2014by whatever name it may be called\u2014is shared alike by all classes of natives.\n\nOmens are of two kinds, lucky and unlucky. If one about to start on a journey, or undertake a particular work, meets with an omen described as a bad one, he postpones the journey and gives up the work for a while, and in many instances he abandons both altogether; and when compelled by necessity to do the one or the other, he does it with the foregone conclusion of a failure.\n\nInstances are known of medical men, summoned to attend on persons dangerously ill, whom, perhaps, timely aid might have saved, returning home and refusing to see the patient, or prescribe for him, as being perfectly useless and unavailing, because just after starting they had met with a bad omen.\n\nThe following verse from an Elu poetical work called Selalihini Sand\u0113saya, written by \u015ar\u012b R\u0101hula Totagamuv\u00e9, the great poet who flourished about the year\n\n* First published in abridged form in the \"Ceylon Diocesan Gazette,\" March 1st, 1879.\u2014Hon. Sec.\n1410, A.D., enumerates some of the good omens which it is lucky to meet with before commencing a journey or undertaking:\n\nLiterally translated it runs thus:\n\nObserve the following omens, and if met with they are far better than even consulting a good planet:\n\n1. A soft and balmy breeze,\n2. A pitcher filled with water,\n3. Peacocks, or sweet mangoes,\n4. Full-blown white flowers,\n5. A sweet-spoken woman,\n6. A gold vessel,\n7. Waving white ch\u00e1mara,\n8. White umbrellas,\n9. Elephants inflamed with ichor.\n\nThe following Sanskrit stanza, from a miscellaneous work on morals Pratya-s\u0142\u00f3kaya [\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0924\u094d\u092f\u0947\u0915\u094b\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0923] also enumerates good omens:\n\n\u2020 See Macready's translation. (Colombo, 1865), Stanza XV., p. viii.\n\n\"Look at thine outset for auspicious signs\nE'en better than the nekata, white fans\nWaving, umbrellas white, King elephants,\nWhite flowers in fullest bloom, and sweet-voiced maids,\nGold pictures, gentle breezes perfumed;\nO'erflowing cars, peacocks, and mango fruits.\"\u2014Hon. Sec.\nTranslation.\n\nIt is lucky for a man or a woman on starting on a journey to meet the following objects, viz.:\u2014\n\n1 Virgins,\n2 A milch cow,\n3 A tom-tom,\n4 A conch shell,\n5 Curdled milk,\n6 Fruit,\n7 Flowers,\n8 A flame of fire,\n9 A person after his ablutions,\n10 Horses,\n11 Elephants,\n12 Bullocks,\n13 A pitcher filled with water,\n14 Flags,\n15 S\u0113sat placed on elevated ground,\n16 Two strings of fresh fish,\n17 White boiled rice,\n18 Cow ghee,\n19 A harlot,\n20 Fresh meat,\n21 Sweet words.\n\nThe following Sanskrit stanzas are found in a similar work, and describe certain good and bad omens in connection with reptiles, birds, and beasts:\n\nTranslation.\n\nIf, on starting on a journey, a house lizard should cry on your left, or if a bird, a reptile, jackals, crows, or pigeons cross from the left to the right, it is unlucky; if from the right to the left, it is lucky.\n\nTranslation.\n\nIt is unlucky to meet with the following objects, viz.:\u2014\n\n1 One besmeared with clay or oil,\n2 A cobra,\n3 One with dishevelled hair,\n4 Naked persons,\n5 The aged,\n6 Noseless and blind persons,\n7 People with clotted hair,\n8 People covered with mud,\n9 A gossip, or one given to nonsensical talk,\n10 Empty pitchers,\n11 Dried wood (faggots),\n12 Noisy and quarrelsome people,\n13 Red flowers,\n14 Red garments.\n\nAmongst the Singhalese or Malabars, any person sneezing suddenly before commencing any work, taking any food or drink, or starting on a journey, allows a short interval to elapse before he begins his undertaking. But according to the following stanzas, extracted from a Medical Miscellany, it appears that in every case a sneeze from every person cannot be considered as prognosticating an omen of ill:\n\nTranslation.\n\nObserve the sneezing of a healthy person. The sneezing of delicate or lean persons and that of cattle forebodes death. Regard not the sneezing of the aged, sufferers from disease of the nose, and children.\n\nTranslation.\n\nSneezing from the\nEast forebodes want of success;\nSouth-east, death;\nSouth, destruction or ruin;\nSouth-west, calamities;\nWest, profit;\nNorth-west, success in whatever one is about to undertake;\nNorth, victory;\nNorth-east, profit.\n\nThe following formula is not unfrequently used in ascertaining the indications of the cry of a lizard, or of the result of a journey or other undertaking. This performance is invariably accomplished by the aid of a second person, the operator.\n\nThe operator arranges on the floor, in any order he chooses, eight pebbles, without letting the enquirer know which pebble he put down first. The operator then calls upon the enquirer to hold or touch any pebble he selects, and commences to recite a portion of the following stanza, from a discourse of Buddha called Ash\u1e6dal\u014dka Dharmmaya, [\u0905\u0937\u094d\u091f\u0932\u094b\u0915\u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e\u092e\u092f], word by word, till he comes to the pebble held or touched by the enquirer, and the result is then ascertained and communicated:\n\nTranslation.\n\nProfit, \u2014 Loss:\nMisery or poverty, \u2014 Prosperity or happiness:\nDisgrace, \u2014 Praise or encomium:\nHealth, \u2014 Sorrow.\n\nThe cry of the house lizard, or the cawing of a crow close to a person or a dwelling, is regarded as ominous of either good or evil, and deductions from such occurrences are detailed in two little works (lately corrected and published by one Hisvell\u00e9 Pandit) used as handbooks of reference by Nekett\u00e1s, or astrologers, called Suhunu-s\u00e1straya [\u0938\u0941\u0939\u0941\u0928\u0941\u0938\u093e\u0938\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0930\u092f] and Kapu\u1e6du-s\u00e1straya [\u0915\u092a\u0941\u091f\u0941\u0938\u093e\u0938\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0930\u092f]\u2014the \"Science of Lizards\" and the \"Science of Crows.\" Much reliance and faith are placed in these omens, and this feeling is in many instances shared by the more intelligent and educated natives.\nThe age of the above works, unfortunately, cannot be ascertained.

To this add 13 and divide by 7. The result must show either gain or profit, sorrow or misery, joy or happiness, food, friends, and lastly, an intelligence of a death. If the remainder be 1, it indicates the obtaining of something of a whitish colour, or sweet in flavour; if 2, it is bad; if 3, something to gladden; if 4, a quarrel; if 5, happiness and gain; if 6, the mean between good and bad; if no remainders, death.\nBesides the deductions of omens from reptiles, &c., already described, the falling or dropping, from a height, of a lizard, a cobra, a hikanal\u00e1, a blood-sucker or a chameleon, or a rat, on the body of any person is thus described:\n\nTranslation.\n\nIf on Sunday, it is a prognostication of victorious results in his projects and intentions;\nIf on Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, or Saturday, it is fatal to him;\nIf on Tuesday, it is fatal to his wife;\nIf on a Friday, it prognosticates his being obliged to quit his native country.\n\nShould these animals fall on the right hand side of any person he will gain or inherit riches which will last as long as he lives: if on the left hand side, it forebodes inexpressibly great evil.\n\nThe cry of the lizard, woodpecker, and the cawing of a crow is only ominous when one starts from home on a journey, projects a work, or is about to express an opinion, or when about to ask for something, or give an order\u2014in fact when about to do or think of anything of utility.\nSCIENCE OF CROWS.\n\nTranslation.\n\nShould a crow caw opposite to you in the morning, it forebodes great sorrow and sickness, death or trouble: if in the noon, profit, gain, and pleasure: if in the evening, gain, and arrival of friends and relatives.\n\nShould it caw in the morning looking towards the sun, great sorrows, sickness, troubles and death, await you: if in the noon, it forebodes the arrival of a friend: if in the evening, obtaining something profitable.\nShould a crow caw (near your dwelling) perched on the uppermost branches of a tree, you will see and converse with a great personage, obtain a present of food, witness the arrival of friends, or experience destruction, sorrow or death; if from the east, rain or wind: if from the west, the meeting of a particular friend.\n\nIf it caw from the north-west, or north-east, looking towards the sun, and perched on a dead tree or a tree without branches, it forebodes the obtaining of meat just killed, or food of whitish colour, and the arrival of a friend within three days.\n\nShould a crow caw from the south-east, perched on the withered stump of a tree looking towards one's face whilst taking meals, it forebodes death, sickness, a sudden journey, or certain death to his wife within three months.*\n\nTo proceed\u2014\n\nTranslation.\n\nShould a crow drop its dung on the head of a person it is a sign of great happiness and comfort ere long: if on the small of the back, or on either of the shoulders, the sign of great happiness and comfort likewise: but if on either of the knees, or on the instep, it is a prognostication of the speedy approach of his death.\n\nThe sudden entrance to any dwelling of certain beasts, birds, and reptiles likewise is considered as a sign of evil, shown from the following stanza, which I quote from a work called Golalipata Namadiya [\u0d9c\u0ddc\u0dbd\u0dbd\u0dd2\u0db4\u0da7 \u0db1\u0db8\u0da2\u0dd3\u0dc0].\n\n* So Sidrophel to Hudibras:\u2014\n\n\"Is it not om'rous in all countries,\nWhen crows and ravens croak upon trees.\"\u2014Han. Sec.\nTranslation.\n\nToucans; Owl; Jackals; Cobras; Swallow; Indian cuckoo; Crows; Outcasts. The entrance of any of these into any human dwelling forebodes its ruin.\n\nThe howling of dogs, jackals, the hooting of an owl from the roof of a house, and the screech of the Ulam\u00e1 or devil-bird near a dwelling-house are considered omens of sickness, sorrow, calamity, or death.\n\nIf a dog happen by some means to climb on to the roof of a house, it is considered as the harbinger of much evil, sorrow, and even death to the family; and the inmates of such houses invariably abandon them at once to avert the evil consequences.\n\nI have known two instances in which very fine houses, built in the Kandyan style\u2014one belonging to a very intelligent and well-informed Ra\u1e6d\u00e9mahatmay\u00e1, the other to a Basn\u00e1yaka-Nilam\u00e9, the latter living within six miles of Kurun\u00e9gala\u2014were abandoned and eventually allowed to fall into ruins in consequence of a dog having been discovered on the roof.\n\nAs one is about to start on a journey or commence any undertaking, a dog flapping its ears is also proverbially known as ominous of bad luck.\n\nIt is said that a dog belonging to a member of the household of the last Kandyan King, located near the store rooms of the Dalad\u00e1 M\u00e1lig\u00e1wa, on one occasion got into the Pattiripp\u00fava (the octagon), and that the Royal astrologers regarded this as an evil omen that would bring ruin upon His Majesty and his possessions ere long. Strange as the coincidence may be, before the expiration of three months the King, hearing of\nthe approach to Kandy of the British troops, had to abandon his throne and kingdom and betake himself to the jungles, where he was captured with his wives, and subsequently transported.\n\nThis belief in omens being identified with domestic life and shared alike by the high and low, is deeply rooted in the native mind, and although the benefits of education and civilization are (aided by the strenuous efforts of the Missionaries) enlightening the masses, it will be long before these superstitions cease to exercise powerful influence over the every-day life of the Sinhalese.*\n\n* \"They are very superstitious in making observations of any little accidents as Omens portending good to them or evil. Sneezing they reckon to import evil. So that if any chance to sneeze when he is going about his business, he will stop, accounting he shall have ill success if he proceeds. And none may sneeze, cough, nor spit in the King's presence, either because of the ill-boding of those actions, or the rudeness of them, or both. There is a little creature much like a lizard which they look upon altogether as a prophet, whatsoever work or business they are going about; if he cries, they will cease for a space, reckoning that he tells them there is a bad planet rules at that instant. They take great notice in a morning at their first going out, who first appears in their sight: and if they see a white man, or a big-bellied woman, they hold it fortunate: and to see any decrepit or deformed people as unfortunate.\" (Knox, \"An Historical Relation of Ceylon, &c.\", p. 64, London, 1681.

The sources of information cannot be too carefully and critically investigated, sifted, analyzed, and tabulated. The feeling of Nirv\u00e1na is hinted at in the Upanishad literature.* It is frequently mentioned in the Br\u00e1hma\u0144ic Pur\u00e1\u1e47as.\u2020 In the\n\n* See for instance the Upanishad (Mundaka III. 2, 6.) where the commentator explains Nirv\u00e1na.\n\u2020 See the Bh\u00e1gavat Pur\u00e1\u1e47a, Vish\u1e47u Pur\u00e1\u1e47a.\nTantra literature it occurs as a concrete fossilised ceremony.*\n\nIn the Bh\u00e1gavat G\u00edt\u00e1, the scriptures of all the sects of the Hind\u00fas, Nirv\u00e1na is the predominant aspiration\u2020; it is cherished by the present generation of the pious Hind\u00fas; it is a prominent idea in their sacred music.\u2021\n\nThere are two schools of Jainas\u2014the Digambara and Sv\u00e9tambara; both propound a view of Nirv\u00e1na. The ground-basis of their theology and metaphysics is the same as that of the Buddhists.\u00a7 But they do not carry their doctrines to all their consequences. Rationalistic in their feeling and aspiration, they are to a certain extent conservative in their practices and customs. Their literature || is extensive, intricate, and varied\u2014a literature which throws a great deal of light upon the subject of Nirv\u00e1na.\n\nNirv\u00e1na is a central doctrine of Buddhistic theology and metaphysics. The Buddhistic literature of N\u00e9p\u00e1la, the Tibetan Buddhistic literature, the Burmah Buddhistic literature, the Chinese Buddhistic literature, the Ceylon Buddhistic literature\u2014all these have been opened up to scholars by Brian Hodgson, by Cosmo K\u00f6r\u00f6s, by Bigandet, by Beal and by Hardy.\n\nIndian Buddhism, though extinct as a living system, is still important on account of the writings of the different A'ch\u00e1ryas of the different schools. The dicta uttered by the Y\u00f3g\u00e1-ch\u00e1ryas, the Sontrantikas the Vaibh\u00e1sikas, and the\n\n* In the Agni Pur\u00e1na this ceremony is described because it is an attempt at an Encyclop\u00e6dia of the Br\u00e1hma\u1e47ic science, history and philosophy.\n\n\u2020 See (V. 25. and VI. 15.) of the Bh\u00e1gavat G\u00edt\u00e1.\n\n\u2021 See an Abhanga of Tuk\u00e1ram:\u2014Nirvap\u00edch\u00e1 eka P\u00e1\u1e47duranga. See the Prabodha Chandrodaya which describes the doings of Chatainya of Bengala.\n\n\u00a7 The Jainas recognize karma or eternal activity as the Baudhas do. They discard the notion of god and sacrifice as the Baudhas do. They believe in the eternity of religious truth which they state is revealed from time to time as the Baudhas do. They uphold the doctrine of metempsychoisis as the Baudhas do. Both maintain pain to be positive.\n\n|| There are large Jaina libraries in Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d, and in some towns of the Karnatic.\nM\u00e1dhyamikas are found scattered in the polemical literature of the Br\u00e1hma\u1e47as, such as the writings of Kum\u00e1rla Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da.*\n\nThough the researches of eminent scholars have accomplished much in elucidating the subject of Buddhistic Nirv\u00e1\u1e47a, yet the water sheds of Br\u00e1hma\u1e47ic, Jaina, and Buddhistic literature are not reached and investigated. What is known is, however, sufficient to show the series of transformations the doctrine of Nirv\u00e1\u1e47a has passed through between 1,000 B.C. (the time of the Upanishad literature), and 1,200 A.D. (the time of Br\u00e1hma\u1e47ic and Jaina revival).\n\nII. A position stated.\u2014A doctrine like that of Nirv\u00e1\u1e47a, accepted and acted upon by the masses of people in different countries of the world, is not a mere accident; it is a growth determined by the environment of those who maintain the doctrine\u2014an environment involving historical conditions and circumstances, and originating in a many-sided revolution. Buddhism is a popular revolt against the exclusive \u00c1ryan conquerors. It is a rebellion of the proleteriat against the upper classes. It is the polity of absorption determined to upset the polity of exclusion. It is the masses (S\u0101\u1e45gha) in opposition to the upper classes (Udgha). It is a socialistic movement against the hereditary aristocracy of ancient India and its prior rights. The sequel will elucidate and support this view of Nirv\u00e1\u1e47a.\n\nIII. Summary of the differences between the Buddhists and V\u00e9dists.\u2014There were conservative and liberal \u00c1ryas\u2020; the former attempted to exclude half-castes from their schools: the latter encouraged them to learn and gave them instruction.\u2021 The S\u0101\u1e45gha or a class\u2014consisting of the \u00c1ryanized non-\u00c1ryas, half-castes and degenerated \u00c1ryas\u2014was distinguished from the higher classes or genuine \u00c1ryas \u00a7. The leaders of the S\u0101\u1e45gha gradually grew in intelligence and pressed forward, claiming\n\n* See M\u00e1dhava S\u00e1ya\u1e47a's Sarva Dar\u015bana S\u0101\u1e45graha, which offers a summary of their doctrines.\n\n\u2020 The P\u016brva M\u012bm\u0101\u1e41s\u0101 (VI. 1, 26, 27.)\n\n\u2021 Chh\u00e1ndogya Upanishad (IV. 4, 1.)\n\n\u00a7 P\u0101\u1e47ini's S\u016btras (III. 3, 86.)\nadmission into the Aryan polity. The Nish\u00e1ds* declared that they could perform sacrifices as the Aryas did. Sacrifice was the soul of all Aryan thought, feeling and activity; and none but the genuine Aryas could perform it.\u2020 The learned Aryas either favoured or opposed the Nish\u00e1ds; there were thus philo-Nish\u00e1ds and anti-Nish\u00e1ds. The conservative Aryas restricted or sought to restrict the rights of women,\u2021 declaring that they could not possess property of their own, that they could not learn in schools, that they could not live independently of the joint-family. The Aryan laws bore hard on the non-Aryas, and on the half-castes \u00a7; even a distinctive costume was prescribed.\u2016\n\nImpressed with the conviction that the Aryan gods were powerful and prompt in granting prayers, and that Aryan institutions conferred superiority and contributed to comforts of this life, the Sangha naturally desired to adopt the forms and modes of Aryan worship, to live as the Aryas lived, and to enjoy themselves as the Aryas did.\u00b6 They were systematically suppressed; and the Sangha was agitated. Vexed and alienated by the superciliousness of Br\u00e1hma\u1e47a priests, the Kshatriyas dissented, and condemned the V\u00e9dic polity of exclusion.* Some of the Va\u015byas necessarily sympathised with the Kshatriya princes.\u2020\u2020 The Sangha persisted in asserting their rights, but failed in securing them. The conflict between the genuine Aryas and the Sangha terminated in a revolution. Buddhism came.\n\n---\n\n* The P\u00farva M\u00edm\u00e1ns\u00e1 (VI. 1, 51.) and the K\u00e1l\u00edya Shronta S\u00fatra (I. 1, 12.)\n\u2020 The Taittir\u012bya Br\u00e1hma\u1e47a (I. 2, 1, 26.)\n\u2021 The P\u00farva M\u00edm\u00e1ns\u00e1 (VI. 1, 6 and 8.)\n\u00a7 The Upakri\u1e63\u1e6da and the Rathak\u00e1ra.\n\u2016 The costumes of the Br\u00e1hma\u1e47as and Kshatriyas are definitely described.

The platforms of the polities of exclusion and absorption or the V\u00e9dic and Buddhistic polities.\u2014The doctrine of worldliness was systematized. It was distinctly stated that the duties of man\u2014or rather A'ryan man\u2014were to live in happiness here and hereafter;* but perfect liberty to do as one pleased was not sanctioned. The V\u00e9da was recognised as a code\u2020 of ethical, social, and political conduct\u2014the eternal V\u00e9das.\u00a7 Truthfulness as among the A'ryas themselves was recognized as a binding and paramount duty.\u00b6 Worldly happiness was identified with heaven; and worldly happiness in its variety could be secured, they believed, by performing duly their sacrifices in conformity with the V\u00e9da.|| Gods like Indra or Mitra favoured their exclusive privileges, and it was a special privilege of the A'ryas to lord it over the whole world and specially over the non-A'ryas.\u00b6\u00b6 The reformers made a new departure: they condemned worldliness, and opposed to it spirituality:** they condemned exclusion and opposed to it universal benevolence: they condemned sacrifice and its arrogant superiority and opposed to it spiritual contrition of the heart: they condemned caste and opposed to it universal brotherhood: the schools were opened to all who sought instruction. A distinction was made between individuality, local in its grasp and earthly in its aspirations, and universality, disclosing transcending views, and inspiring by its deep spirituality. This is the first view of Nirv\u00e1na\u2014a condition of positive spiritual bliss as distinguished from worldly happiness or temporal power or secular privileges. The V\u00e9dic sacrifice pre-supposed worldly prosperity and encouraged secularity.\u2020\u2020 The V\u00e9dic A'rya sought happiness by acting on external nature and his surroundings. The reformer or the A'rya of the\n\n---\n\n* The P\u00farva M\u00edm\u00e1ns\u00e1 (VI. 1, 1,3.)\n\u2020 Id. (I. 1, 2.)\n\u2021 Id.

The first is systematized in the P\u016brva M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 philosophy: the last in the Y\u014dga doctrine.\n\nV. The cardinal principle of Y\u014dga and the cardinal doctrine of Gautama Buddha.\u2014\"Oh! man, control thyself\" was the principle which Buddha emphatically propounded and inculcated on his followers.\u2020 The Y\u014dga starts and ends with this same statement.\u2021 Nibbuti is thus opposed to Pabatti: attachment to life and its pleasures was opposed to asceticism. This is the first view of Nirv\u0101\u1e47a\u2014the view of moderate reforming \u0100'ch\u0101ryas who, still revering the V\u0113dic polity, aspired beyond it. Their utterances seek to reconcile sacrifices with spirituality, exclusion with absorption. Influenced by the narrowminded, but glorious, past, they rose superior to themselves, and, ascetically disposed and spiritually moved, looked into a future of universal benevolence.\u00a7\n\nVI. The Naimisya forest and its ascetics.\u2014Either prevented from living in towns or determined to enjoy his ecstatic trance in the solitude of the wilds, the Kshatriya philosopher or the \u015audra, fired with spiritual aspirations, retired into the Naimisya forest, and passed his life there, meditating on the essence of all he saw in external nature or of all he felt within himself. He characterized this conduct as Departure or Pravrajy\u0101. He earnestly sought the noumenon which underlies and constitutes all phenomena or tatva. Various were the conjectures of such philosophers and ascetics. Some fixed upon air || as\n\n* The Brihat Aranyak Upanishad.\n\u2020 \u2021 Compare Vi\u00f1\u00f1apassa Nirodhena etth' etam uparajjhadi\u2014a dictum of Buddha Gautama and Yogastu Chitta-Vritti-Nirodha\u2014the Y\u014dga S\u016btra (I. 2.)\n\u00a7 This is the spirit of the Upanishad literature. The distinction between Par\u0101 and Apar\u0101 Vidy\u0101 deserves attention (Mund. I. I. 5.) See again the Mundaka Upanishad (1 2. 2.)\n|| Samvarga Vidya Chh\u0101ndogya Upanishad (IV. 3, 1.)\nthe essence of all existence: others resolved matter and mind into light. Some analyzed life, its conditions and circumstances into a spirit in which they lived and moved: others referred their life and its phenomena to spiritual or meditational warmth. Whatever any of these thinkers fixed upon as the ultimate analytical unit or essence, they all agreed in condemning the V\u00e9dic polity which sanctioned animal sacrifices, and inculcated that worldliness itself was the last goal of all human aspirations. Abhi\u1e63\u0101 (recognition of all animal life being sacred) was the cardinal point of their belief; but they did not in a wholesale manner condemn the past. The V\u00e9dic polity with its devotion to caste, to sacrifice, and to the prior rights which they secured was adjudged to be inferior to the new philosophy,* the result of the new departure taken by these reforms. If sacrifice deserved attention and recognition, it deserved attention, because it led to contemplation of the essence of all intellectual, moral and physical phenomena.\u2020 A systematic attempt was made to interpret anew the utterances of the Rishis known as Mantra, and many Mantras were spiritualized away: worldliness was interpreted into spirituality. Women were freely taught: G\u0101rg\u012b and Maitrey\u012b discoursed on metaphysical subjects with their distinguished husband Yajna\u00f1alkya. Young men of doubtful birth were initiated into the mysteries of the new philosophy. Thus the land-marks of the V\u00e9dic polity were washed off. Aspiration after a new philosophy, earnest spirituality, a spirit of adjustment, new interpretation, a liberality of spirit with which caste and all prior rights were incompatible, distinguished these reformers. Nirv\u0101\u1e47a at this time signified identity and absorption into the unlocalized, universal, subtle essence which pervades all phenomena. A teacher points this out to a pupil:\u2014\"That thou art, Somija\u2021, that spirit which moves the air, from whose fear the sun regularly shines, and to which death itself is obedient.\"\u00a7 Attached to the V\u00e9dic polity,\n\n* Distinction between Par\u0101 and Apar\u0101 Vidy\u0101 (Mund. 1, 1, 5.)\n\u2020 \u0100dhi Daivam &c.

See the Br\u0101hma Vid\u0101 Upanishad (VIII.)\nand venerating it, these reformers did not violently denounce it. A modesty* which earnest enquiry generates, and a love of truth\u2020 which results from spiritual emancipation, characterized the period. The Brahmav\u00e1dins or V\u00e9dic teachers often explained a four-fold salvation,\u2014(i) dwelling in the same place with a god like Indra,\u2014(ii) dwelling near him,\u2014(iii) obtaining his dignity and form,\u2014(iv) identity with him.\u2021 The last was only materially understood by the V\u00e9dic teachers. These reformers or ascetics gave a spiritual interpretation to it and insisted upon final absorption into the spiritual essence as emancipation or salvation. This is the back-ground of Buddhistic Nirv\u00e1\u1e47a.\n\nVII. The Jainas or conservative rationalists.\u2014The Jainas divided into two classes\u2014the Sv\u00e9tambara and the Digambara, or those wearing white clothes and those who go about naked\u2014are to be found in all parts of India. There are about 2,000 of them in the city of Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d alone in Gujar\u00e1t. In this place I cannot discuss the chronology of the Jaina movement, and state the grounds of my belief that the Jainas preceded the Buddhists. The position of the Upanishad reformer was formulated and pressed on the attention of the V\u00e9dic A\u00b4ryas. The conservative sacrificing A\u00b4ryas attempted coercion. Anathemas were pronounced: prayers, offered. The reformers, aspiring after deep spirituality and communion with the all-pervading spirit, were stigmatized as lethargic and their doctrine was declared to be \u201cthe path of inactivity.\u201d The sacrificing A\u00b4rya publicly prayed :\u2014\u201cOh! let my lethargy, or rather my tendency to (moral) sleep, depart to the natives of Vidhea or to contemplative inactive men.\u00a7 In the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata the condition of society is feelingly depicted. Bh\u00edshma despondingly observes :\u2014\u201cNone knows what the truth is. To advance their own interests, selfish men preach to the people what they please.\u201d|| The Vaisyas, little accustomed to think for themselves and disposed\n\n* See the story of Nachiketas.

They, therefore, fell victims to scepticism. Their leaders stigmatized their views and stated their grounds. The logic of scepticism \u2020 was thus developed and it would be elucidated by a contrast between the views of the Upanishad reformer and those of the Jaina. The one merely adjusted the importance of a sacrifice and connived at the slaughter of animals; the other was fired by enthusiasm of life\u2014he strongly condemned the slaughter of any animal for any purpose. To the one Vedic lore, though a dispensation old and inferior, yet was important as the means of his superior wisdom; the other discarded all notion of revelation. The one believed that an abstract essence\u2014a generality, was real, eternal, and could be cognized; the other declared that a generality was only a kind of knowledge, and its notion was derived from the knowledge of particular facts. The one aspired after absorption into the eternal, all-pervading essence; the other aspired after maintaining his individuality \u2021 through eternity. The one believed that all phenomena are only transient and are ultimately to be resolved into Br\u0101hma; the other believed that they are real and eternally abide. The one thought that the universe is either created by or emanated from the Supreme Person; the other discarded all notion of a personal creator. The one was definite in his statements and had resort to the utterances of the Rishis and attempted to interpret them anew to support his views; the other more or less hesitated, but declared that virtue eternally abideth, and that it is revealable by eminent teachers.\n\n* Louk\u0101yatika or Ch\u0101rv\u0101ka as popularly known.\n\n\u2020 This is called Sy\u0101d v\u0101da. It states:\u2014Perhaps a thing is\u2014perhaps it is not. Perhaps in sequence of time it is and it is not. Perhaps at once it is and it is not,\u2014this cannot be stated. Perhaps it is and cannot be stated\u2014perhaps it is not, and cannot be stated. Perhaps in sequence of time it is, and it is not, and cannot be at once stated.\n\n\u2021 This view that every individual object has a spirit is met with in the Zendavesta in its chapter on Farohars.\nEqually repelled by the V\u00e9dic polity, the reformer and the Jaina rose superior to mere materialism of the Brahmav\u00e1dins, and sympathised with higher spiritual aspirations and virtue as distinguished from mere ritualism. Philosophically sceptic the Jaina was practically conservative; rationalistic in his method and aspirations, he adhered to his caste and believed in the philosophy of metempsychosis which the V\u00e9dic thinkers had developed. The reformer and the Jaina condemned this life as a perpetual source of pain and misery and aspired after emancipation or Nivritti, consisting in the eternal enjoyment of positive happiness and in escaping the transmigration of soul from life to life\u2014the inevitable consequence of all activity.\n\nVIII. The philosophical plexus.\u2014The activity of the Jainas paved the way of the radical rationalists or Buddhists. The ground-basis of the doctrine of emancipation as propounded by the Upanishad reformer or V\u00e9d\u00e1ntist, by the Jaina or the conservative rationalist, and by the Buddhist or radical rationalist is the same, because the same cause originated these movements\u2014the opposition to the conquering supercilious V\u00e9dic \u00c1ryas, their sacrificial exclusiveness, their prior rights, and their all-engrossing worldliness, and materialism. The V\u00e9d\u00e1ntist, the Jaina and the Buddhist are all world-weary, and seek the cessation of all activity, and its fruit\u2014the transmigration of soul. Activity or Karma is a potent cause. It is eternal: it is accumulated: it adheres to the human spirit: it produces all phenomena: it abides in the peri-spirit or the semi-material body which it gathers about itself. It is either increased or decreased in one life. As soon as the body decays, and is destroyed it leaves it and takes another body. This activity or Karma is a subtle entity. It is the cause of all human suffering: so long as a particle of this activity remains, there will be to that extent human misery. Separation from it is salvation. Thus human activity, human misery, inseparable from it, and its consequence\u2014metempsychosis, explain all phenomena of human life and of its environment. The practice of virtue, the power of contemplation to nullify the habit of belief in material and corporcal existence, and self-abnegation\u2014these are the remedies\nfor escaping from the trammels of all activity. Thus the Y\u00f3ga philosophy is developed\u2014the philosophy of contemplation or Dhy\u00e1na. I cannot explain in this place its different stages, the progress made from one stage to another, the amount of self-abnegation and power over the self secured, and the knowledge or the intellectual light it generates. The material body is gradually left behind, and the Y\u00f3g\u00ed lives a spirit above all worldliness, above the power of the flesh, free from all power of activity, working miracles and enjoying spiritual beatitude. Activity or rather a tendency to it is the disturbing cause\u2014Up\u00e1dhi. Until a Y\u00f3g\u00ed is completely emancipated, he is in danger of getting into its meshes. Annihilation of all Up\u00e1dhi is complete emancipation. Upon this ground-basis, all V\u00e9d\u00e1ntism, Jainism, or Buddhism are built. But the V\u00e9d\u00e1ntist seeks emancipation from all activity, and practises contemplation and self-abnegation, that the spirit encased in a material body and subject to the power of activity may re-unite with itself in its universality, and being once more unlocalized and universalized, enjoy perfect happiness. The Jaina seeks the emancipation of his individual spirit by the same means and for the same purpose; but he believes that the human spirit maintains its individuality and enjoys happiness for eternity. The Buddhist believes in the power of activity, dreads metempsychosis, practises contemplation and self-abnegation and aspires after emancipation, and yet differs from both the V\u00e9d\u00e1ntist and Jaina materially. His notion of Nirv\u00e1\u1e47a will be elucidated by that of the V\u00e9d\u00e1ntist or Jaina.\n\nIX. The radical rationalist or Buddhist.\u2014The Buddhist differed both from the V\u00e9d\u00e1ntist and Jaina, and made a new departure. The V\u00e9d\u00e1ntist developed into an isoteric school and moved forward on the lines of the V\u00e9dic polity, aspiring after being absorbed into a noumenal essence. The Jaina believed in the individuality of the spirit, and had recourse to acts of charity and faith\u2014a situation into which his logic of scepticism landed him. The Buddhist succeeded in organizing a national movement. His activity accomplished a moral-force revolution which subverted the V\u00e9dic polity itself.\nX. The Buddhistic method.\u2014The V\u00e9dic A'ch\u00e1ryas like \u00c1'sval\u00e1yana, P\u00e1ni and others, had developed and stated the definition method. Jaimini and Patanjali had developed exegetical logic, stated and applied it. The Jaina had sceptically argued. The definition-method, the exegetical logic and the logic of scepticism paved the way of analytic logic which the Buddhist preferred. He was, therefore, called the analytic reasoner.* A persistent attempt at analysing, classifying, and defining knowledge was made.\n\nXI. Its result.\u2014The Buddhist perceived that the human will was the ultimate analytic unit beyond which he could not proceed. The will was the noumenon from which all he said, thought, and felt was developed. This was the Chitta manas, or Ch\u00e9tas.\u2020 The disparity of human destiny and conditions of human life were explained by the action of accumulated activity or Karma. His realistic analytical reasoning recognized the ideality of knowledge as determined by realistic activity. This will, modified and acted on by Karma or activity or merit, was the basis of which all else was a phase\u2014a quality. But the will \u2021 acted on by activity invariably resulted in pain real and cognizable as such. Activity called into existence the will, and modified it. Its modifications are manifold, varied and subtle. The forms of human life and of phenomenal existence were considered to be so many phases of the human will acted on by activity and were not real. Emancipation from misery, the inseparable result of all activity acting on and modifying the will by externalizing it, was the summum bonum. The Buddhist discarded the reality and individuality of the human will and of the external noumenal essence.\n\n* Vibhajya V\u00e1di.\n\n\u2020 The opening lines of Dhammapada, when interpreted from this standpoint, are adequately and consistently adjusted. \"Man\u00f3pubbap gam\u00e1 Dhamm\u00e1\" is a phrase which is not adequately comprehended by those who have attempted to explain it, because they have not carefully examined the antecedents of Buddhism.\n\n\u2021 The Abhidhamma\u2014the metaphysical portion of the Tipitaka recognizes and states Chitta, Ch\u00e9tasika, R\u00fapa, and Nibb\u00e1na.\nXII. The determining causes; the Buddhistic stand-point stated.\u2014The V\u00e9d\u00e1ntist aspired after the eternal noumenal essence, and submitted to the V\u00e9dic polity with its caste, and prior rights, though he sought to interpret the V\u00e9dic code as liberally * as he could. The Jaina recognised the reality and individuality of the human spirit, the basis of his logic of scepticism. His inactivity and his conservatism, the Buddhist necessarily outgrew. Absorbed in profound thought, impelled by introspection, he feelingly believed, and assiduously taught. His view of the human will and of phenomenal existence was thoroughly analytic and the stand-points of the V\u00e9d\u00e1ntist and Jaina determined his view. The gross feeling or K\u00e1ma was distinct from form, and form was distinct from the ideal existence of form but not free from action or Kriy\u00e1. Beyond this was the life of contemplation, of introspection, of deep absorption, of all freedom from externalization gross or subtle. This is the K\u00e1m\u00e1vachara, the R\u00fap\u00e1vachara, Ar\u00fap\u00e1vachara, and L\u00f3kuttara, forms of life. In the last there is no action whatever, no Kriy\u00e1 chitt\u00e1ni, but the Vip\u00e1ka chitt\u00e1ni are playful, the Chitta or the will as acted on by itself. \u2020 To sum up, all gross and pure action and bustle \u2021 in the K\u00e1m\u00e1vachara life; pure formal action, but no bustle in the R\u00fap\u00e1vachara life,\u2014abstract ideal action in the Ar\u00fap\u00e1vachara life; but peace and inaction are the exclusive privileges of L\u00f3kuttara life.\n\nXIII. The ground basis of Buddhism or the \u00c1'riya-sachchas, and the Indian system of Y\u00f3ga.\u2014(1) Dukkha sachcham, or suffering in its variety; (2) Samudaya sachcham, or all life as a development of different analytic conditions; (3) Dukkha nirodha, or suppression of all thought and feeling of suffering; and (4) final emancipation.\u00a7 U\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u00e1na (Vyu\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u00e1na) or Pavatti (Prav\u1e5bitti) or gross life of mere externalization is common to\n\n* See the Story of J\u00e1b\u00f3la in the Chh\u00e1ndogya Upanishad, 4.\n\u2020 See the 1st Parichhedha of the Abhidhamm\u00e1tttha Sangaha.\n\u2021 The term U\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u00e1nam (Vyu\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u00e1nam in Sanskrit) characteristically expressed this. Y\u00f3ga was the latter term. Pavatti (Prav\u1e5bitti in Sanskrit) is another term.\n\u00a7 See the 9th Parichhedha of the Abhidhamm\u00e1tttha Sangaha.\nboth Buddhism and Y\u00f3ga. Both recognize that suffering (Kl\u00e9sa) is the inevitable destiny of humanity, a destiny intensified by the elaborate system of metempsychosis, both state that the Chitta or the heart, the intellect and will\u2014combined and forming one unit\u2014is constantly acted on and modified by activity, and a tendency to externalization, and this is the cause of all suffering. Both proclaim aloud that the suppression of this tendency is the means of happiness.* The means of accomplishing this suppression are identical in both, intense contemplation\u2020 which ends in producing a vision or higher knowledge.\u2021 The great point of difference is, the human will is the last unit recognized by the Buddhist, and beyond it he does not go. His notion of the human will corresponds to that of Y\u00f3ga; but Y\u00f3ga sees behind the human will a spirit which is essentially identical with the all pervading spirit, but which is enthralled and encased in the human body. This is the V\u00e9d\u00e1ntist view. The Jaina rejected it and declared the independent individuality of the human spirit, ever independent and ever existing by itself. The Buddhist rejected both as noncognizable by his intense and profound introspection. He knew he saw (R\u00fapa); he knew he perceived (V\u00e9dan\u00e1); he knew he reflected (Sa\u00f1\u00f1\u00e1); he knew his mind was acted on by itself, and its activities, and that which its merits and demerits attached to it (Sankh\u00e1ra); he knew he rose superior to all this, and absorbed in contemplation, realised a tranquility and a profundity of feeling (Vi\u00f1\u00f1\u00e1na). Beyond this, \u00a7 in the realm of infinity of knowledge or intellect, he lives, preparing for entering the stream of the great paths. When in this condition, he is above all\n\n* Notice and compare the following\u2014Yogachitta Vritti Niradhah\u2014the second S\u00fatra of the Y\u00f3ga Philosophy. (explained in my \u201cStudies in Indian Philosophy.\u201d) and the utterance of Buddha Gotama, \u201cetassa nirodhan\u00e1 idha\u2019 etam nirujjhati.\u201d\n\n\u2020 Sam\u00e1dhi or Jh\u00e1na. The Buddhist has elaborated this by his analytic reasoning. The Y\u00f3ga simply states it.\n\n\u2021 Compare Sam\u00e1patti in both, and the \u00d1ana Dassana S\u00e1ma\u00f1\u00f1a phala, Vipassan\u00e1 Dibbachakkhu of the Buddhist with Ritambh\u00e1ra Praj\u00f1\u00e1 of the Y\u00f3gi.\n\n\u00a7 \u00c1k\u00e1sana\u00f1ch\u00e1yatana; Vi\u00f1\u00f1\u00e1na\u00f1ch\u00e1yatana; \u00c1kina\u00f1\u00f1\u00e1yatana; Nevasa\u00f1\u00f1\u00e1nasa\u00f1\u00f1\u00e1yatana.\nform: he is conversant with nothing but abstract knowledge; his will is, however, affected and works.* His five-fold combination falls to pieces and ceases to exist when he enters the four paths. His intense contemplation and introspection failed him when he attempted to soar higher than this. Nor did he see the necessity of going beyond this. The tendency to externalization inseparable from the will so liable to be affected by external and internal influences, being destroyed, that on which Kamma can act, is destroyed. If nothing beyond the Chitta or the human will or heart in its five Skandhas existed or could be realised, then nothing in the form of noumenal essence would be thought of. The Buddhist began with introspection and ended with it.\n\nXIV. Buddhistic attitude towards the Vedic, Vedantist, and Jaina systems.\u2014He hates the Vedic polity, its pantheon, its heirarchy, its exclusiveness, and its prior rights. To him the Vedantist goes only half the way, and the Jaina is wrong, and is not able to contemplate and introspect. The Vedic polity recognizes the independent eternal individuality of the human spirit. It is the basis of the Purva Mimansa philosophy. Ondulomi had stated it long before Jaimini. The Jaina follows the Vedic polity in this, but the Buddhist rejects it as likely to land him in all the absurdities of ritualism and caste as he conceives it. The Vedantist recognised eternal noumenal essence consisting in eternal existence joined to intelligence and happiness.\u2020 When introspection unlocalized and universalized his inner self or the Chitta, he found himself plunged in a nothingness immeasurably expanding on all sides, transcending all thought, and growing into an infinitude of space and eternity.\n\nXV. Upadisesa Nibbana.\u2014The peri-spirit comes into existence, energises and externalises so long as a tendency to Karma exists. The tendency is annihilated when all desire is vanquished, when a Buddhist has risen superior to the flesh.\n\n* Mark the Vipakachitta and Kriyachitta as explained in the Abhidhamma.\n\u2020 Sachehidananda. This is the watch-word of all schools of Vedantists: it is based on utterances in the Upanishads.\nWhen in this condition a Buddhist is J\u012bvan Mukta, one who is emancipated while living, he is Bh\u0101vit \u0100tman, one who is unlocalized and universalised. He has yet, however, to live for some time and his accumulated activity is to be consumed by dint of mere living. When the accumulated activity is thus exhausted, he is completely emancipated when he dies, i.e., when his peri-spirit (the Pa\u00f1chaskandhas) fall to pieces, and when it can no longer act. The first condition is characterised as Up\u0101dis\u0113sa Nibb\u0101nam. A Buddhist is an Arhat. He is in the fourth Rath. He is a perfect Y\u014dg\u012b. He can perform miracles. He lives in a condition of beatitude. He lives on the earth merely to live out his last portion of earthly existence. The last condition\u2014the condition of an Arhat after his death is characterised as Anup\u0101dis\u0113sa Nibb\u0101nam. The Y\u014dga system of Indian philosophy throws a flood of light on this view of Nibb\u0101na. A perfect Y\u014dg\u012b ecstatically declares he has only to pass a few days of his last earthly existence in sportiveness. \u201cEmancipation is my wedded spouse.\u201d *\n\nXVI. Anup\u0101dis\u0113sa Nibb\u0101na.\u2014Perfect Nibb\u0101na is characterised in the following way by the Buddhists:\u2014\u201cA condition (Padam) permanent (Achchutam), infinite (Achchautam), unconditioned (Asankhatam), highest (Anuttaram)\u2014Nibb\u0101nam this say the great sages (Mahesayo) who are delivered from all desire (V\u0101namukt\u00e1).\u201d \u2020 I attach some importance to the term Viharati \u2021 \u201clives in sportiveness\u201d used in the Mah\u0101nibb\u0101na Sutta. \u201cAgain a Y\u014dg\u012b free from desire, from the sight of existence, sees the Sankh\u0101ra as nihil; (sees) the Skandhayatan\u0101ni, and Dh\u0101tavat as nihil (both) spiritually and materially; sees (all) realities distinctly as infinite (An\u0101laya) and known by the properties of ether (\u0100k\u0101sa) and of the law of Buddha (Dharma).\u201d \u00a7 \u201cEmancipation is the result of the extinction of all desire, the consequence of thought and feeling.\u201d || I have\n\n* See the Abhangas of Tuk\u0101rama.\n\u2020 See the 6th Parichcheda of the Abhidhamm\u0101ttha Sangaha.\n\u2021 See page 30 of Childer's edition.\n\u00a7 See the Lalita Vist\u0101ra Chap. XIII.\n|| This statement is made by Madhav S\u0101yana, a scholiast and an authority in Indian Philosophy.

Perfect Nirv\u0101\u1e47a stated.\u2014It is a negation of all that man, thinks, feels, and wills. So far it is nihilism. It is a negation of all suffering which results from thought, feeling and volition. So far it is nihilism. But suffering according to a Buddhist, a Jaina, or a V\u00e9d\u00e2ntist is a positive entity. Happiness he does not recognize as positive. Suffering (Dukkha) is positive and results from localized existence. Both localized existence and suffering are destroyed together. When this is accomplished, unlocalized universalization is emancipation, co-extensive with happiness itself. Suffering is the inevitable result of all localization: happiness\u2014of all universalization. Hence Nirv\u0101\u1e47a is both negative and positive. It is not nihilism. Nirv\u0101\u1e47a is beyond all localization. This is what all the Buddhists state. Reasoning on the basis of introspection alone, and observing the facts as they develope in the inner man, they stated that there are different degrees of localization. Infinity itself, as conceived by man, is localized. Eternity as conceived by man is localized. Hence persistent efforts were made by Buddhists so to soar in contemplation as to rise higher than all conception itself, as to leave behind all thought, feeling, and volition. In the K\u00e1m\u00e1vachara all is gross, material, involved in a multiplicity of all that is \u201cfrail and feverish;\u201d above it is the R\u00fap\u00e1vachara, the region of Gods and Divinities. Form is localized, and what is grosser and more material than form is dropped. Beyond the R\u00fap\u00e1vachara is the Ar\u00fap\u00e1vachara in which form itself is dropped, i.e., left behind. Infinity, eternity, is contemplated. But being the subject of contemplation, it is localized. In the four paths all this is left behind, and all tendency to localization is checked, i.e., destroyed. Existence\u2014substance\u2014that which is the nameless, the formless, the eternal, the infinite, the permanent, the unconditioned has a tendency to be localized. This tendency to be localized is what is called activity or Karma. It is strengthened as it is indulged. The tendency localizes the universal and Panchaskandhas result.\nThen there is immediately thought, feeling and volition which are inseparable from suffering. Buddhism does not attempt to state the properties or attributes of the unlocalized\u2014the eternal\u2014because no matter how carefully a statement is made, the fact of statement will localize it. It is, therefore, beyond all statement. It is enough to say\u2014it is Nirv\u0101\u1e47a.\n\nXVIII. Conclusion.\u2014Buddhism is an interesting study, scientifically, philosophically, religiously, socially, and politically. Scientifically, because science seeks the unification of force and the elements which embody all force; philosophically, because Buddhism discovers to what the psychological method of introspection leads; religiously, because when there are so many Buddhists in the world, not believing in a personal God and not yearning to worship Him the fact of religious instincts of man calls for re-examination and re-statement; socially, because it ignores all ritualism, ceremonies, and social life in its amplitude and minutude, in its materialism and its subtility of love, and ambition; and politically, because the convent of the Buddhists subverted the Vedic polity of caste, sacrifice and prior rights, and justified the aspirations of a proletariat and placed them on a legitimate basis for the first time in the history of man.\nTWO SINHALESE INSCRIPTIONS.\n\nBY B.

The translator has, therefore, taken the liberty to note and italicise what he considers clerical errors and place the proposed readings at the bottom of each page. He will feel thankful to any persons who may favor him with their remarks on the doubtful words of the text which he has noted, or suggest any better readings than those proposed by him.*\n\n**INSCRIPTION.**\n\n*Mr. L. De Soysa read a Paper on the Pepiliy\u00e1na inscription before the Society some years ago, but it was not printed in the Journal at the time, and is now lost. The following extract from the Paper appeared in the Ceylon Times of June 11th, 1873:\u2014\n\n\"This inscription, is to be found on a rock on the site of an ancient Buddhist Temple near K\u00f3tt\u00e9, where from A. D. 1410 to A. D. 1542 Sinhalese Kings held Court.\n\n\"No part of the ancient buildings of the Temple now remain, having been, it is said, levelled to the ground, by the Portuguese who destroyed this and other buildings in and near K\u00f3tt\u00e9.\n\n\"My copy of the inscription was taken from one in the possession of a Buddhist Priest who now occupies the modern Pansala built on the supposed site of the ancient Temple, and I was informed by him that his teacher's teacher obtained it some 70 or 80 years ago, from a transcript preserved in the*\n\n*a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z\nArchives of the late King of Kandy. There can be no question however, as to its genuineness. I have compared it with such parts of the stone as still remain, and have found that it exactly corresponds with the stone. The style and matter too of the inscription furnish indisputable evidence of its genuineness and authenticity.\n\n\"The inscription records the erection and endowment of a Buddhist Temple in memory of his deceased mother Sun\u00e9tra Mah\u00e1 D\u00e9vi, by King Sri Par\u00e1krama B\u00e1hu VI., who reigned at K\u00f3tt\u00e9 (according to Turnour) from A.D. 1410 to 1462. It also contains a variety of provisions for the due maintenance of the temple; for the expenditure of its income; and regulations for the observance of the clerical and lay members of the establishment.\n\n\"The style of the inscription is similar to that of other writings of the 14th or 15th centuries; and Mr. Alwis has published in his Introduction to the Sida Sangar\u00e1, the introductory paragraph of the inscription as a specimen of the prose of that age. The construction of the sentences, however, is very peculiar. The whole of the inscription, which is a very long one, is conglomerated, as it were, into one sentence by means of conjunctive particles and participles, having apparently only one finite verb expressed. The words in general are those in modern use, with a very few exceptions which I have noticed in the notes.\"\n\"The date assigned to the King's accession is stated to have taken place in the year of Buddha 1958 (A.D. 1415), whereas Turnour in his adjustment of Sinhalese Chronology, computed from native records, has fixed the date at 1953 (A.D. 1410) five years earlier. The authority of the stone however, cannot be disputed, and it is in a remarkable manner confirmed by the well known contemporary poem K\u0101vyas\u0113khara, the author of which was the most learned monk of the age, and, according to tradition, the King's adopted son.\n\n\"The regulations enacted for the management of the Temple establishment and for the distribution of its income are also very curious, and throw considerable light on the manners, customs, and social condition of the Island at the period in question. It shows that the form of Sinhalese letters now in use have not undergone any material change, during, at least, the last five or six hundred years, with the exception of a few.\n\n\"It is believed by many that the worship of Hind\u016b Gods, and the practice of Hind\u016b rites and ceremonies, were introduced into Ceylon by the last Malabar King who obtained the throne of Kandy, after the extinction of the Sinhalese Royal Family about the year A.D. 1739; but it would appear from the inscription that the innovation is of much earlier date. The King it is well-known was an eminent patron of Buddhism, having built four D\u00e9valas in connection with the Vih\u0101r\u0113.\"\u2014Hon.

It will be well if, in conformity with this Rock-Inscription caused to be inscribed by royal command,\nthe two classes of Priests, Kings, Sub-kings, Prime Ministers, &c., take care to maintain this Vih\u0101ra perfectly and to attain the bliss of heaven and Nirw\u0101na, not having failed (to act properly as regards) both worlds.\n\nOn Sunday the 5th day of the bright half of the month Unduwap (November-December), in the 44th year (of his reign, the abovenamed King Sri Par\u0101krama B\u0101hu) with a view to procure merit for the great Queen, gave orders to S\u0113liyadarayarun and caused to be completed the work of the image houses, halls, cells, &c., in the Vih\u0101ras of Kalub\u014dvila, Wattala, Mahara, M\u0101damp\u0113, Dedigomuwa, Navayodana, Denawaka and Aramanasala, and granted (the following lands, &c.,) to the venerable priest Sun\u0113tr\u0101 Mahad\u0113vi Piriwantera of Pepiliy\u0101na pouring out the water of donation and dedicating them to the Three Gems, to wit:\n\nFifteen amunas of paddy sowing extent from Kehelpat-dolavela, and houses and gardens thereabout; Totakumbura recently aswed\u1e0dumised in Kasawela; Mirisgala Kanda with the jungle and open ground thereon; Kendangomuwa; Elabada-kumbura of two amunas paddy sowing extent and Deltota kumbura (both) in M\u0101gama; tracts of forest and low lands contained in these villages, twenty males and females; Morato\u1e6da and Pattiy\u0101 for the purpose of supplying furniture for the Vih\u0101ra. The learned and high priests of this Vihara should cause this to continue for a long time by acting exactly in the manner above described.\n\nIf any one should hereafter disturb, encroach upon, or complain of any one of the abovementioned things given for the benefit of the Three Gems, or if any one should impose a new task by royal command, he will be born in hundred and thirty-six hells including eight principal hells, such as, Sanj\u012bva, K\u0101las\u016btra, &c., and suffer indescribable misery and be liable to the punishment assigned to such as have been guilty of the Panch\u0101nantariya crimes, such as parricide, &c. If any persons take back land given by himself or by another, or appropriate the produce thereof, he will be born a worm in f\u0153ces (and continue in that state) for a period 60,000 years.\nIf any one takes away grass, or wood, or flower, or fruit which belongs to Buddha, he will become a great Pr\u00e9ta.\n\nMay future kings, great ministers, &c., constantly bear in mind the humble request:\n\n\"I, Par\u00e1krama B\u00e1hu, Supreme Lord of the illustrious Lanka, the ornament of the solar race, make a request to you, O princes, who will hereafter come (to the throne of Lanka); hear ye my words. This religious act is certainly one in which the inhabitants of all the worlds are equally concerned. It is to be maintained by you at all times with feelings of joy and kindness towards me.

Let no unusual services, (such as, payment of) taxes or tribute be imposed on the residents of the Vih\u00e1ra. Let no residents of the Vih\u00e1ra be sold away by persons of any rank.

Gunatilaka, Esq.\n\n(Read, September 14th, 1882.)\n\nVery great interest and importance attach to the folk-lore of any nation, as is evidenced by the labors bestowed on the subject by eminent writers, and the manner in which those labors have been appreciated. The tales of a people once collected and recorded afford material alike for the ethnologist, the philologist and the historian to build upon, and enable them to arrive at truths previously unknown, and to throw fresh light upon theories which are but partially established. It is not the amusement which the tales and stories afford that makes them valuable but it is the great truths which they point to in the field of literature and science that commend them to our notice and study. Readers who wish to have some idea of the importance of folk-lore to ethnology and its cognate sciences, will find the subject fully treated in the \"Chips from a German workshop\" of Max M\u00fcller, and in the introduction to the \"Popular Tales from the Norse\" of Mr. Dasent.\n\nWhile different writers have labored in the work of collecting tales in other countries, while each successive number of the \"Indian Antiquary\" presents to us the folk-lore of the Panjab and other parts of India, it is a matter both of regret and surprise that no writer in Ceylon has, so far as I am aware, yet begun to work in a systematic manner in collecting the folk-lore of this Island.\n\n* I was requested by the Honorary Secretary of this Society, about a month ago, to prepare a Paper to be read at this Meeting, and he suggested the Folklore of Ceylon as a subject that would be of interest. Although the time at my disposal was insufficient either to collect materials, or, when collected, to digest them, I readily accepted the undertaking, convinced that any shortcomings on my part would be excused in view of the shortness of the time given me and the difficulty of the subject to be dealt with.\nMr. Steele the author of a metrical translation of the *Kusa J\u0101taka* has,\u2014no doubt with the view of attracting the attention of literary men to this interesting subject,\u2014given a few Sinhalese stories as an appendix to his work, and has concluded them with the following appropriate observations:\n\n\"Old-world household stories are very plentiful in Ceylon. The foregoing may be of interest as shewing how rich a field, one little harvested yet, lies open to the gleaner. When it is remembered that, besides the aboriginal wild race, the Vedd\u00e1s, the Island is the home of Sinhalese, an Aryan race from the upper valley of the Ganges, of Tamils, of Moors, the descendants of the ancient Arab navigators, who, as Sinbad avouches, voyaged often to Serendib, of Malays, not to mention Pars\u00eds, Chinese, Kaffirs from Eastern Africa, M\u00e1ldivians, Beng\u00e1lis and many others,\u2014men of widely diverse descent and creeds, the abundance of, so to speak, unwrought folk-lore will be readily recognised.\n\n\"It is the writer's hope, should the present venture meet with favor and acceptance, to offer a large and more varied selection to the reader hereafter.\"\n\nThe hope here entertained has not, I think, been realized, nor has the subject been taken up by any other writer that I am aware of.\n\nA complete collection of the tales and stories existing in Ceylon,\u2014and I think they exist as abundantly here as in any other country in the world,\u2014can only be the work of time. It is therefore desirable that, rather than wait to make such a collection, writers who may wish to labor in this field of literary investigation should publish what stories they may collect in the columns of this Society's Journal as the only literary periodical in the Island.\n\nThe present Paper is merely a beginning in this direction, and it is to be hoped that other writers who are more able than myself to undertake the task, and have more leisure at their disposal than I can command, will from time to time contribute their collections to this Journal, and thus supply a store of materials for future scientific and linguistic investigations.\nIn the work of collection it is necessary that a great deal of care and discrimination should be exercised, for what is really wanted and what can lead us to real truths are the genuine stories of the Sinhalese\u2014those which are quite free from foreign influences and have existed among the people from time immemorial. These can only be gathered from the inhabitants of villages and of the remoter parts of the Island into which western civilization has not yet penetrated. In the principal towns and suburbs there are now current among the Sinhalese several stories taken from English books and other sources, and hence too much care and caution cannot be exercised in deciding whether a story is really free from such influences or not.\n\nIn this paper I am able to give only one Sinhalese story out of the collection I have made. Its aim is to shew the cunning and avarice of women and the fertility of their resource when tricks have to be resorted to for the accomplishment of an object, the averting of a calamity or the getting out of a difficulty.\n\nIn order to understand the story it is necessary that the reader should know what is meant by the expressions \"to take sil\" and \"to give sil.\" Sil is a religious observance. \"To take sil\" is to vow or to promise and solemnly undertake to follow strictly the precepts of Buddha, not to kill, not to steal, not to drink &c. One desirous of taking sil attends the Pansala and after bowing down in reverence to the priest recites \"the three sara\u1e47as\" as follows, the devotee repeating them after him:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Buddha\u1e47 sara\u1e47an gachchh\u0101mi,} \\\\\n\\text{Dhamma\u1e47 sara\u1e47an gachchh\u0101mi,} \\\\\n\\text{Sangha\u1e47 sara\u1e47an gachchh\u0101mi.}\n\\]\n\nThis is done three times after which the commands or precepts are recited by the priest and repeated by the devotee. In this ceremony the priest is said \"to give sil\" and the devotee \"to take or receive sil.\"\n\nI must also premise before beginning the story that when a priest is invited by a layman to his house for the purpose of performing a religious ceremony or of partaking of meals usually\ncalled *dan* or *dana*, \"a gift or any thing given,\" it is not permitted to the priest to decline the invitation, except under unavoidable circumstances such as sickness or a prior engagement.\n\nThe story then runs thus.\n\nOnce on a time there was a simple and dull-witted man who had a cunning and artful wife. The woman was, however, much devoted to religion, and was a regular attendant on *poya* days at the Vih\u0101ra and P\u0101sala in order to worship Buddha and to receive *sil*. The man, who had previously paid no attention to religion, was one day seized all of a sudden with a desire to follow the example of his wife, and calling her immediately to his side said, \"I wish to take *sil*: tell me how I should set about it.\"\n\nThe wife delighted to see her husband form so good a resolution said, \"Get up very early in the morning, go to the P\u0101sala with a pingo of boiled rice and curries, offer them to the priest, and repeat the words which he will pronounce.\"\n\nThe earnestness with which the man formed his resolution and his anxiety to act on it were so great that sleep fled from his eyes, and he impatiently watched for the dawn to hasten to the priest's residence. Long before the break of day he set out for the P\u0101sala which lay about a mile from his house. On arriving there he found the door closed, but he knocked with such violence as to rouse the priest who was fast asleep in an inner chamber.\n\n\"I wonder\" said the priest to himself \"who this can be that disturbs my repose at this ungodly hour.\" So saying he rose and began to rub his eyes. The knocks on the door continued with redoubled vigour. The priest then jumped out of bed, and approaching the door with some degree of anxiety said \"Kavuda?\", \"Who's there?\"\n\nThe man, following literally the instructions of his wife as to repetition, replied \"Kavuda?\"\n\nThe priest could not understand how any one could be in the mood for fun at such a time or place, and drawing still nearer the door said, \"Mokada?\", \"What's the matter?\"\n\"Mokada?\", repeated the man.\n\nThe priest was bewildered. He could not for the life of him understand the meaning of so strange a proceeding, and he called out in a loud and stern tone, \"Allapiya\", \"Lay hold (of him).\"\n\n\"Allapiya\" was as quickly echoed forth.\n\nThe priest then went into one of the rooms to wake up his servant, and in the meantime the simpleton, hearing nothing more, concluded that the ceremony was over and returned home, leaving the pingo at the door. The priest and his servant opened the door to see what it all meant, and right glad were they to find the pingo, but they could see no one.\n\nOn reaching home the man called his wife to his side and said, \"I have received sil: I feel such a change: I am determined to be more assiduous than you have been in the observance and practice of the rite.\" The man then went to work in the field, returned home in the evening, and took his dinner, but was scarce in bed before he repeated \"Kavuda? Mokada? Allapiya.\"\n\n\"What's the sense of these words?\", enquired the wife in surprise.\n\n\"I am reciting what the priest taught me when he gave me sil,\" said the man.\n\n\"I wonder if you're right in your head!\", said the wife.\n\n\"Nay,\" said he, \"in right good earnest I tell you, I repeat what the priest taught me. I am practising sil.\"\n\n\"Don't talk to me,\" retorted the woman. \"If you're not mad already, you're very near it!\"\n\nThe man, however, paid no attention to his wife's words believing her to be in jest, but kept repeating the words all night long at frequent intervals, to the serious disturbance of his wife's rest and that of the other inmates of the house. This went on for several nights, and nothing that the wife could think of had the effect of convincing the man of his mistake.\n\nAbout this time three thieves broke into the King's Treasury at night, and stole from it a part of his treasure, consisting of gold, silver, precious stones, pearls and jewels of great value.\nCarrying off their booty they came to the pilikanna [back part] of the man's house, and, as it was a safe and convenient spot for the division of their spoil, they began to divide it. They had hardly commenced their task when they were startled by the words \"Kavuda? Mokada? Allapiya\" in a loud voice from within the house.\n\n\"We are undone,\" said one of the thieves: \"Discovered most certainly,\" said another: \"Hush! hush!\" said the third, \"the words may have been addressed to somebody else.\"\n\nSo they made up their minds to go on with the division, but had scarcely recommenced before the same words \"Kavuda? Mokada? Allapiya\" fell on their ears. Then they forthwith took to their heels leaving the booty behind.\n\nThe man hearing all the clatter outside, went to the pilikanna with a light, and saw to his amazement the three heaps of treasure. He immediately awoke his wife and took her to the spot. Her eyes beamed as she beheld the unexpected wealth. Husband and wife together conveyed the heaps into the house, and all was secure in trunks before the day dawned.\n\n\"Now,\" said the man, \"was it not my observance of sil that brought us this luck?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the wife, \"I am glad you have been so earnest in its practice.\"\n\nThe man's thoughts were now directed to the consideration, as to how best he might shew his gratitude to the priest who had given him sil.\n\n\"It is our duty,\" said he to his wife, \"to make a gift of one-third of the wealth to the priest who gave me sil, and who has thus been the means of our acquiring this unlooked for fortune. Prepare breakfast for him, therefore, to-morrow morning, and I will invite him to partake of it, and to receive the offering of a third of the treasure.\"\n\n\"Nay, nay,\" said the woman, \"that will never do. What the priest taught you was not sil.\"\n\n\"Nonsense,\" said her husband, \"hold your tongue and attend to what I say. I must shew my gratitude to the priest; I must give him a third of the wealth.\"\n\"Well, if you must\u2014you must\" said the woman.\n\nWords and tears were of no avail. The man was firm as a rock, and his wife gave up all hopes of dissuading him from his purpose.\n\nNext morning she prepared meals for the priest. The man called at the Pansala and said to the priest: \"My lord, you were kind enough to give me sil some time ago, and I have been a constant and diligent observer of the rite ever since. The result is that I have been blessed with very valuable treasure, quite sufficient to keep me and mine comfortable for many generations to come. Condescend therefore to repair to my humble abode, partake of the meal I have prepared for you, and receive one-third of the fortune I have come by, as a token of my gratitude.\"\n\n\"I never saw you before,\" said the priest, \"nor do I remember having ever given you sil.\"\n\n\"Then it must be some other priest in this Pansala,\" said the man; \"it matters little which, only come and receive the gift.\"\n\nThe man led the way and the priest and his servant followed, not, however, without some suspicion and fear. When they had come within sight of the house the man saw his wife standing in the compound.\n\n\"Come on leisurely,\" said the man to the priest, \"while I run a-head to see that everything is ready for your reception.\" So saying the man ran up to his wife and whispered in her ear, \"Has our neighbour brought the curds we ordered last evening?\"\n\n\"Not yet.\"\n\n\"I will go and fetch it then,\" said he; \"in the meantime give the priest a seat and attend to him till I return.\"\n\nNow when the priest saw the man whispering in the woman's ear, his suspicions of some foul play, which had already been roused, were almost confirmed.\n\nSo when he got to the house he said to the woman, \"Pray what did your husband whisper in your ear?\"\n\n\"Bad luck to you! \", said the woman, \"my husband is gone to fetch a rice pounder to make an end of you!\"\nWhen the priest heard this he ran as fast he could and the servant after him.\n\nThey had not run far before the man returned with the curds.\n\n\"Why are they running away?\" said he.\n\n\"That's more than I can say,\" answered his wife; \"but the priest told me to ask you to follow him with a rice-pounder.\"\n\nThe man hastened into the kitchen, took up a rice-pounder, and away he went at full speed.\n\n\"Stop a bit! stop a bit! your Reverence,\" he bellowed.\n\nBut the priest, seeing the man actually following with a rice-pounder, redoubled his steps and was soon out of sight, and the man could not find him though he searched every nook and corner of the Pansala.\n\nSo the man returned home and never more thought of offering the wealth to the priest, and right glad was the woman to find that her plan had succeeded so well.\nBUDDHA'S SERMON ON OMENS.\n\nBY LOUIS DE ZOYSA, MAH\u00c1 MUDALIY\u00c1R.\n\n(Read, September 14th, 1882.)\n\nThat the Founder of Buddhism has repudiated caste and superstition both in theory and practice, is well known. A high authority* has characterized Buddha as \"the great opponent of Hind\u00fa caste and superstition.\" But in countries like Ceylon, in which Hind\u00faism had prevailed before the introduction of Buddhism, caste and superstition still exist though in a modified form; and writers whose information is derived from secondary sources are apt to forget the real teachings of Buddha on these subjects. A notable instance of this I may mention here. A recent writer,\u2020 \"On the Religions of India\" has, according to a review of his work in the Athen\u00e6um, attributed the introduction of caste into Ceylon to the influence of Buddhism!\n\nI hope to lay before the Society from time to time, translations of extracts from Buddhist writings bearing on these two subjects. In the present note I shall confine my remarks to the subject of \"superstition,\" reserving those on \"caste\" for a future occasion.\n\nA fair idea of Buddha's views on superstition may be formed on reference to two papers published in this Society's Journal. I allude to the able translation of \"Brahmaj\u00e1la Sutta\"\u2021 by the late Revd. D. J. Gogerly, in which various superstitions are enumerated and condemned as \"unworthy and animal sciences,\" and to my own translation of two J\u00e1takas, (Nakkhatta and Namasiddhi),\u00a7 one of which exposes the folly of\n\n---\n\n* The late learned Dr. Mill, Principal of Bishop's College, Calcutta.\n\u2020 Mr. A. Barth. (Tr\u00fcbner's Oriental Series.)\n\u2021 C A. S. Journal 1846 (Reprint, 1861) pp. 17\u201462.\n\u00a7 C. A. S. Journal 1880, Part II, pp. 29\u201433.\nbelieving in astrology, and the other of the practice of conferring on individuals what are supposed to be lucky or auspicious names.\n\nMy special object however in the present note is to bring to light the true object of Mangalan Sutta, one of the most remarkable discourses of Buddha against \"superstition,\" which is found in two of the canonical Scriptures of Buddhism, namely in the Sutta Nipata and Khuddaka Pattha sections of the Khuddaka Pattha of the Sutta Pitaka.\n\nThere are three English translations extant of this discourse\u2014one by the late Rev. D. J. Gogerly, in the Ceylon Friend for June 1839, another by the late Professor R. C. Childers in his translation of the Khuddaka Pattha, and a third in the late Sir M. Coomara Swamy's translation of Sutta Nipata; but by an unhappy rendering of one expression by the learned translators, the true object of the discourse, namely, that of exposing the folly of believing in omens, has been completely kept out of view, and the discourse is simply regarded as a series of excellent moral maxims. Mr. Gogerly rendered the words \"etan mangalan uttaman,\" \"these are chief excellencies\": Mr. Childers, \"this is the greatest blessing\": this is also the rendering adopted by Sir M. Coomara Swamy.\n\nWhen Mr. Childers' able and lucid translation of Khuddaka Pattha appeared in 1874, I ventured to address a letter to that gentleman referring him to the Atthakatha or Commentary on the discourse, which explains its origin and objects, and submitting to him whether the words \"etan mangalan uttaman,\" which he has rendered \"this is the greatest blessing,\" should not be more correctly rendered \"this is the best omen,\" or \"these are the best omens.\" In reply he approved of my proposed rendering, but unfortunately having mislaid his letter, I am deprived of the gratification of producing it, but it will be seen that my late lamented friend has made the following note in the Addenda to his Pali Dictionary Vol. II. P. 617 s. v. \"'mangalo,' 'mangalan,' means also 'an omen.' I learn from Louis de Soysa that 'etan mangalan uttaman' should be rendered 'this is the best omen.'\"\nThe reasons which have induced me thus to render the words \"etan ma\u1e45gala\u1e47 uttama\u1e47\" will be seen from the following condensed translation of the introduction of this discourse in the Commentary.\n\n\"What is the origin of ma\u1e45gala\u1e47 suttan? It was the practice for people in Jambud\u012bpa to assemble at the gates of cities, in meeting houses and other places, and to hear the recital of various stories such as those of S\u012bt\u0101, Bharata, &c. The people discussed various subjects at these meetings. Each discussion some time lasted for four months. On one occasion, the subject of discussion happened to be that of ma\u1e45gala\u1e47 (happy or auspicious things i.e. good omens). What is a dittha ma\u1e45gala\u1e47 (a good omen of sight)? What is a suta ma\u1e45gala\u1e47 (a good omen of smell or taste or touch)? Do you know what a ma\u1e45gala\u1e47 is?, said some of the audience present). One of them, a believer in omens of sight (dittha ma\u1e45galiko), said, 'I know what a ma\u1e45gala\u1e47 is. For example, a man rising up early in the morning sees a speaking bird,* tender fruits of the bilva tree (\u00c6gle marmelos), a pregnant woman, a child, an ornamented brimming jar, a fresh cyprinus fish, a thorough bred horse, or the likeness of one, a bull, a cow, a tawny coloured cow, or any other object of an auspicious nature,\u2014it is a ma\u1e45gala\u1e47.' Some of the audience accepted his theory, but those who did not entered into a dispute with him.\n\n\"A believer in omens of hearing (suta ma\u1e45galiko) remarked that the eye sees what is pure and what is impure, what is good and what is bad, what is pleasant and what is unpleasant. If what is seen by the eye be a ma\u1e45gala\u1e47 (good omen), then every object of sight must be one. What is seen therefore is not a ma\u1e45gala\u1e47: that which is deemed a true ma\u1e45gala\u1e47 is that of hearing. If a man rising up early in the morning hears a sound such as 'it has prospered,' 'it is prospering,' 'it is full,' 'it is fresh,' 'it is delightful,' 'prosperity,' 'increase of prosperity' 'the lunar constellation,' 'to-day is auspicious,' 'a lucky moment,' a 'lucky day,' or any other pleasant sound deemed auspicious, this is said to be a ma\u1e45gala\u1e47.\n\n* Such as a parrot, mina, &c.\n\"Whereupon a believer in omens of smell, taste and touch, (muta mangaliko) addressed the meeting saying:\u2014'A man hears what is good and what is bad, what is pleasant and what is unpleasant; if what is heard by the ear be a mangalan, (good omen) then everything heard must be a good omen also. I say therefore that suta mangalan is not a true mangalan, and that the true mangalan is what is called muta mangalan. For example, if a man rising up early in the morning smells the fragrance of the lotus and other sweet smelling flowers, uses fresh dentrifice, touches the earth, or ripe corn, or fresh cow-dung, or a turtle, or a heap of sesamum seed, or flowers, or fruits, daubs (the floor) with fresh earth, puts on a new cloth, wears a new turban, or smells any other sweet smells, tastes or touches an object deemed auspicious\u2014it is a mangalan.'\n\n\"Thus men all over Jambudipa formed themselves into groups, and began to discuss what the real mangalani are. From men, their guardian deities, from them, their friends the terrestrial deities, from them, their friends the celestial deities, from them, their friends the deities of the Ch\u0101tummah\u0101rajika heavens, and from them, all the deities as far as Akanittha, the highest of the heavens, took up the subject of mangalan, and forming themselves into groups, began to discuss what mangalani are. Thus the discussion lasted for twelve years amongst men and gods. (except among the disciples of Buddha) throughout the ten thousand worlds of the universe, but they were unable to solve the problem. At last the gods of the T\u0101vat\u012bsa heavens approached Sakko, and begged of him to declare what the mangalani are. The King of the gods enquired of them where the Supreme Buddha was then residing. Being told that he was then residing at J\u00e9tavana Monastery in the city of S\u0101vatthi, he directed one of the gods to repair to him, and beg him to declare what mangalani are, and the god did so.\"\n\nThe sequel is told in the Sutta itself, and now I have the pleasure to reproduce Mr. Childers masterly version of Mangala Sutta, only substituting the expression 'this is the best omen,' for 'this is the greatest blessing.'\n\"Thus I have heard. On a certain day dwelt Buddha at \u015ar\u0101vasti, at the J\u00e9tavana Monastery, in the garden of An\u0101thapindaka. And when the night was far advanced a certain radiant celestial being, illuminating the whole of J\u00e9tavana, approached the blessed one, and saluted him and stood aside. And standing aside addressed him with this verse:\n\n'Many gods and men, yearning after good, have held divers things to be blessings (good omens); say thou, what is the greatest blessing (the best omen or the best omens)?\n\nBuddha:\u2014'To serve wise men and not serve fools, to give honour to whom honour is due, this is the greatest blessing (this is the best omen or these are the best omens).\n\n'To dwell in a pleasant land, to have done good deeds in a former existence, to have a soul filled with right desires, this is the greatest blessing (this is the best omen or these are the best omens).\n\n'Much knowledge and much science, the discipline of a well trained mind, and a word well spoken, this is the greatest blessing (this is the best omen or these are the best omens).\n\n'To succour father and mother, to cherish wife and child, to follow a peaceful calling, this is the greatest blessing (this is the best omen or these are the best omens).\n\n'To give alms, to live religiously, to give help to relatives, to do blameless deeds, this is the greatest blessing (this is the best omen or these are the best omens).\n\n'To cease and abstain from sin, to eschew strong drink, to be diligent in good deeds, this is the greatest blessing (this is the best omen or these are the best omens).\n\n'Reverence and lowliness, contentment and gratitude, to receive religious teaching at due seasons, this is the greatest blessing (this is the best omen or these are the best omens).\n\n'To be long-suffering and meek, to associate with the priests of Buddha, to hold religious discourse at due seasons, this is the greatest blessing (this is the best omen or these are the best omens).\n\n'Temperance and chastity, discernment of the four great truths, the prospect of Nirv\u0101na, this is the greatest blessing (this is the best omen or these are the best omens).\"\n'The soul of one unshaken by the changes of this life, a soul inaccessible to sorrow, passionless, secure, this is the greatest blessing (this is the best omen or these are the best omens).\n\n'They that do these things are invincible on every side, on every side they walk in safety, yea, theirs is the greatest blessing, (theirs are the best omens).'\n\nIt may be remarked, how could such distinguished scholars as Gogerly and Childers have committed such a mistake as the one referred to? The matter is easily explained. They have evidently translated the word *mangalan* in its ordinary sense,* without referring to the commentary which explains the special sense in which the word is used in this discourse. This is not to be wondered at, seeing that even some of the learned Buddhist Priests of the present day commit the same mistake and interpret the discourse simply as a series of moral maxims. Strangely enough, this discourse is used by Buddhists even for purposes of superstition, such as, exorcism, etc. It is so used by the Kandyan Buddhists according to Mr. C. J. R. LeMesurier, c.c.s., who, by the way, calls it \"the Sutra of Festivals\" which might lead one to suppose that it has some connection with the various Kandyan Hind\u00fa Festivals, which he describes in his account of \"The Principal Religious Ceremonies observed by the Kandyans of Ceylon.\"\u2020\n\nIt is only when this discourse is viewed by the light thrown on it by the commentary, that it appears in its true character, as one of the most powerful exposures of Hind\u00fa superstition on record.\n\n---\n\n*Mangalo* (adj.)

LEWIS, Esq.\n\n(Read, November 2nd, 1882.)\n\nNo naturalist, or more probably, no ornithologist has ever looked upon a feather without admiring its beautiful structure, and admirable adaptation of ends to means. Here will be found a maximum of strength in a minimum of weight; adapted alike, as an organ of flight, or as a means of warmth to the creature that supports this exquisite structure. Colored in some instances only as a means of attraction, or, in others, as one of protection, and yet withal, light as proverbially, 'as a feather.'\n\nIn variety of external form, we have many, even in Ceylon birds, though of course, if the examples of variation of pattern, from all parts of the world were tabulated, a long and interesting list could be made, were such necessary. My object in the present Paper is of a further character, and one which requires a deeper investigation than that of a mere comparison of external shapes and forms.\n\nA feather may not inaptly be likened to a cocoanut leaf or branch, as it is sometimes called. There is the shaft or quill, and from it diverge other shafts which form the webs. If a breast feather be pulled from some well-known bird, say a Woodpecker, we observe in the lower, or basal region, that the quill supports a shaft, or, as I shall call it, a web-shaft Fig. 1 (bb); which, in turn, towards the lower half of the feather bears a fine thread like process, say one-tenth of an inch long, which I shall call the sub-web-shaft Fig. 1 (ccc). In the upper or exposed part of the feather, this sub-web-shaft is absent, leaving the conclusion that these fine filaments are for the purpose of warmth\u2014a con-\nPlate I.\n\nNo 1\n\nShewing (a) the quill; (bb) the web shafts; and (ccc) the sub web shafts much enlarged so as to shew clearly the portions in question.\n\nNo 2\nSub web shaft of simple order x500.\n\nNo 3\nSub web shaft of the telescopic order x500.\n\nNo 4\nx500.\n\nLithographed at the S.G. Office, Colombo.\nPlate II.\n\nNo 5\nOf the partially spinous order\n\u00d7500\n\nNo 6.\nOf the highly spinous order\n\u00d7500.\n\nNo 7.\nThe probable aboriginal form\n\nNo 8.\n\nLithographed at the S.G. Office, Colombia\nclusion by no means unreasonable, as otherwise they are useless, and further a single glance would show that this portion of the feather is closer, and hence warmer, than if these sub-web-shafts were absent. Supposing a web shaft is removed from the same feather\u2014Woodpecker's\u2014and placed under a microscope of some power, the sub-web-shafts exhibit a series of joint-like markings of a more or less modified character. See Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5, & 6.\n\nThis modification is of very considerable interest, as the conclusion that I have arrived at, after carefully examining a large series of Ceylon birds, is, that they are modifications of an aboriginal form, which I have ventured to illustrate.\n\nI have drawn my conclusions from the fact, that at remote periods of time, it is but reasonable to conclude, that birds required a closer plumage than at present, in order to endure a colder temperature than now upon the earth, and to bring about that end a further addition to the sub-web-shaft would render most material assistance. I am confirmed in this view by the fact that some of our high flying eagles, such as Spizaetus, possess a spine upon the sub-web-shaft, that can be considered as a modified filamentous process, just as the sub-web-shaft is itself.\n\nThe conclusion then to be drawn is that those representing the series Fig. 2, are of a much older formation than the series Fig. 4 through process of modification, through disuse. In like manner the forms up to Fig. 6 can be traced up to what was probably the aboriginal form, Fig. 7. I am inclined to believe that any of the forms may be traced through variation and modification to the form Fig. 7, which through long ages of disuse forms the present modified structure. If then, this view be correct\u2014and I am unable to see cause for any serious objection to it\u2014the course of modification may be traced as represented in Fig. 8, from the aboriginal form to the present, as shewed by the dark lines, and the dotted lines, which bear a strong comparison with Fig. 7, or with Fig. 6, which last is an existing form.\n\nI consider that by this peculiarity of structure we shall be able to trace the relative ages of existing forms of birds, which\nin itself may be considered as a means of classification, if such there be. Unfortunately, I have not had the good fortune to be able to examine the plumage of birds from other countries, more especially those from the colder climates of the extreme north which would give evidence either in support, or to the contrary of my theory. For the present, I venture the subject more as a question, than as an established fact, though the evidence from local examples tends greatly to prove the force of my theory.\n\nClimatic effects may probably bear with more or less weight upon the point, but I find the conclusion is still irresistible that each existing form can be traced to a higher, which we may call the aboriginal parent, and its necessity is just the same, in a larger measure, as that which supplies the present sub-web-shaft. Where warmth is unnecessary, then sub-web-shafts do not exist, as for instance in the tail feathers, or feathers beyond the body, and by analogy, where greater warmth is required, then the additional process would exist, which through non-necessity is now reduced to a simple, or at most a spinous joint.\nSINHALESE FOLK-LORE STORIES.\n\nBy W. Knight James, F.R.G.S., F.R. Hist., S.\n\n(Read, November 2nd, 1882.)\n\nThe Sinhalese are essentially a social people. Some of the most important traits of their character are, deep attachment to friends, filial obedience; and love of their homes and villages. There are a few greater hardships which a Sinhalese can be called upon to undergo than separation from the home and friends of his childhood, and there are few dearer reminiscences to him, wherever he may be in after life, than those which recall the early days spent in his native village. Home stories and sayings exercise no little influence on him, and at any rate in the leisure portion of the life of the villager oral stories take an important place, whether they be the J\u00e1taka stories of the various births of Buddha,\n\n\"The preternatural tale,\n\"Romance of giants, chronicle of fiends,\"\n\nor the more modest stories that relate the doings of the people. In the Sinhalese home it is true that the \"fireside\" with which we connect the story-telling of harsher climes is absent, but it finds its representative in the little verandah or in the roadside, and often when the family have retired to rest for the night in the single room and verandah which generally form the \"house\" of the Sinhalese cultivator, one member, frequently the grand-father relates stories to the others until he finds that the \"dull god\" has drawn away his audience. In the night as two or three villagers sit guarding the ripening grain of their paddy fields from the inroads of elephant, buffalo or boar, stories serve to wile away what would be otherwise a weary vigil, and on numerous other common-place occasions story-telling plays an important part. Some of these stories throw considerable light\non the modes of thought, manners, and customs of the people, and also may perhaps be of some value in comparative folklore, I therefore give translations of a few of these village stories.\n\nI.\u2014The Trial at Avich\u00e1ra-pura.*\n\nIn the neighbourhood of Badulla there is among the Sinhalese a saying, when justice appears to have miscarried:\n\n\"Avich\u00e1ra-pur\u00e9 naduwa w\u00e1geyi,\"\u2014\"Like the trial at Avich\u00e1rapura.\"\n\nThe story on which the saying is founded is without doubt of considerable age and contains rich satire:\n\nOne night some thieves broke into the house of a rich man and carried away all his valuables. The man complained to the Justice of the Peace, who had the robbers captured, and when brought before him enquired of them whether they had anything to say in their defence. \"Sir,\" said they, \"we are not to blame in this matter: the robbery was entirely due to the mason who built the house; for the walls were so badly made, and gave way so easily, that we were quite unable to resist the temptation of breaking in.\" Orders were then given to bring the mason to the Court-house. On his arrival he was informed of the charge brought against him. \"Ah,\" said he, \"the fault is not mine, but that of my cooly, who made mortar badly.\" When the cooly was brought he laid the blame on the potter whom he said had sold him a cracked chatty, in which he could not carry sufficient water to mix the mortar properly. Then the potter was brought before the judge, and he explained that the blame should not be laid upon him, but upon a very pretty woman who in a beautiful dress was passing his house at the time he was making the chatty, and had so riveted his attention that he forgot all about the work. When the woman appeared, she protested that the fault was not hers, for she would not have been in that neighbourhood at all had the goldsmith sent home her earrings at the proper time; the charge she urged should properly be brought against him.\n\n* A, 'without'; vich\u00e1ra, 'enquiry'; pura, 'city.'\nThe goldsmith was brought and as he was unable to offer any reasonable excuse, he was condemned to be hanged. Those in the Court however begged the Judge to spare the goldsmith\u2019s life; \u201cfor,\u201d said they, \u201che is very sick and ill-favoured and would not make at all a pretty spectacle\u201d; \u201cbut,\u201d said the judge, \u201csomebody must be hanged.\u201d Then they drew the attention of the Court to the fact that there was a fat Moorman in a shop opposite who was a much fitter subject for an execution, and asked that he might be hanged in the goldsmith\u2019s stead. The learned Judge, considering that this arrangement would be very satisfactory, gave judgment accordingly.\n\nII.\u2014The Goldsmith Who Cheated His Mother.\n\nOf all workmen the Sinhalese regard the native goldsmith with the greatest suspicion. This is due no doubt to the fact that, whenever opportunity occurs, he appropriates a portion of the precious metal entrusted to him, often substituting for it that of a baser kind. There are many sayings in the language to the effect that \u2018whoever else is to be trusted, a goldsmith is not\u2019; and there is a popular belief that \u2018a goldsmith would cheat his own mother\u2019, in illustration of which the following story is told:\n\nA certain woman possessed a large piece of gold made up in the form of a frog,* which had been a heir-loom in her family for many years. She, though wishing to keep the metal, was anxious to have it made up in the form of ornaments, which she could wear and display before her friends. She was afraid to take it to a goldsmith, for she knew that they all had the reputation of being rogues, and that she would most likely be cheated. It, therefore, occurred to her that the safest way would be to have her son apprenticed to the trade: this she accordingly did. When he had learned it sufficiently well, she took the golden frog to him and requested him to make it into the ornaments she required. The cunning fellow first obtained a live frog and placed it among the ashes of his fireplace, and then, whilst his mother stood by, took the golden\n\n* S. Gemadiya.\none, put it among the ashes also, and commenced to blow the fire to melt it down. The live-frog feeling uncomfortable in the heat immediately jumped out and hopped away. \"See, dear mother\", said he, \"your frog is gone. How can you expect me to make ornaments from a living thing?\" \"Oh, my dear son\", said the mother, \"what is worse than bad fortune? My lump of gold has turned into a lump of flesh.\"\n\nIII.\u2014A Story of Two Rogues.\n\nThere are several stories which relate to the sharp-wittedness of people from different villages, towns, or districts, and which, seem to imply much the same as is expressed in our English proverb \"set a thief to catch a thief.\" The following is well-known, and, although the story varies somewhat in different localities, is in substance the same. The names given to the two rogues vary with the place where it is told, but they are, as far as I have heard, always the names of different villages, or districts, with the affix y\u00e1 or w\u00e1 thus Gampolay\u00e1 and Rayigamay\u00e1, 'a Gampola man' and 'Rayigama man'; Migamiw\u00e1 and M\u00e1taray\u00e1, 'a Negombo man' and 'M\u00e1tara man':\n\nTwo men who lived in different districts, and who depended principally on their wits for a livelihood, started off one day about the same time each to pay a visit to the other. On their way they met, and agreed to go together in search of adventure. As they went on they heard the sound of weeping at a certain house and, finding the friends of a dead man mourning for him, they went and joined in the lamentations. When the question of the division of the deceased's property arose, they put in their claim. \"Who are you?\", the people asked, \"and what right have you to any of the property?\" \"Was not this our own poor old grandfather whom we have not seen for these many years?\", said the men weeping. The friends at the house were so affected by the grief of the strangers, that they agreed to go that evening to the grave of the dead man, and see if he would express any wish in the matter. One of the rogues slipped out unobserved and laid himself beside the grave. \"Is it your will that these two\nstrange persons should have any share in your property?\u201d, asked one. \u201cYou are all my children: divide it amongst you fairly\u201d, came in sepulchral tones from the grave. Having received a box containing some valuable articles, they started off, and after journeying for some time lay down to rest near the sea-shore, placing the box between them. One, finding the other asleep shortly afterwards, took the box, and, going into the sea as high as the armpits, buried it in the sand; then going back again to his place fell asleep. Soon afterwards the second man awoke, and, finding his neighbour asleep and the box gone, guessed what had been done with it. He therefore commenced to lick along the whole length of his body, and, finding the taste of salt did not go above his armpits, knew the depth where it was buried. Having discovered the box, he carried it away; and hid himself in one of a number of ricks of straw that were standing a short distance off. On the other man awakening, he knew that his friend had discovered the treasure and made off with it, but, as had not had time to escape far, he thought that he was most likely hiding in one of the heaps of straw hard by. Tying a sokada (wooden bullock bell) round his neck he went on his hands and knees knocking his head against each of the ricks. The man who was hiding hearing the noise and thinking it was a buffalo, shouted out \u201cJah! jah! kotiy\u00e1 k\u00e1*!\u201d and so was discovered. After this, it is said, they divided the spoil equally.\n\nIV.\u2014How the Tumpan\u00e9 Folk went a-Bees\u2019-Nesting.\n\nAmong the folk stories of the Sinhalese there are a large number which relate to simpletons,\u2014a class of stories which we find in most countries. The following bears some resemblance to the story of the Wise Men of Gotham, who, seeing the reflection of the full moon in the river Trent as they passed over, and thinking it to be a cheese lying at the bottom, lowered one of their number with a rope to reach it.\n\nOne day a man in Tumpan\u00e9 (a district renowned for its foolish people) wanted some honey for his daughter who was\n\n* An imprecation, lit., \u201cMay a tiger eat you!\u201d\nvery sick: so he got his friends to assist him, and they started off to the forest in order to find a bees' nest. As they were passing by a deep pond, they beheld the reflection of one which was suspended on an overhanging tree. Having tried vainly to grasp the nest in the water, they thought that it must be deeper down than they supposed, and one of their number was, therefore, sent in. Believing, as he was unable to touch it, that he could not get down far enough, they tied a large stone round his neck. The other fools stood by the whole day waiting for the man to come up with the honey.\n\nV.\u2014How a Tumpan\u00e9 Man cured his Mother.\n\nOnce upon a time a half-witted villager bought a bullock to use in his hackery, and, as he took it away, the dealer (a philosopher in his way) repeated to him this proverb:\n\n\"Harak diya-badu w\u00e1ge,\" lit. \"cattle are like watery things,\" (that is, they are perishable, and consequently require a great deal of care and attention). The man, however, took the saying literally, and, noticing water coming from the bullock as it went along, thought that it had already commenced to dissolve. He was now very anxious to dispose of his bullock before the process went farther, and a man happening to be passing with a ketta (bill-hook) in his hand, the owner of the bullock asked 'what the ketta would do': \"fell jungle\", said the man. It was then agreed that an exchange should be made of the bullock for the ketta. The half-witted fellow took the axe, and going to some jungle land which belonged to him, placed it upon a stone and went away. Some time afterwards he returned to see how much jungle it had felled, but was surprised to find that it had not cut even a single tree. When he picked it up he found the iron was quite warm, and concluded that it had not been able to work that day as it was suffering from fever. He, therefore, went to the doctor, who, knowing how foolish the man was, appeased him by telling him to bury it in a cool spot until the morning and he would then find the fever gone. The man did as he was told, and found his ketta quite cool. Next day, however, his mother had a severe attack of fever, and, remembering\nthe medicine that had cured his ketta, he took the poor old woman to the same spot, and making a bigger hole carefully covered her up.\n\nVI.\u2014Hunting a Palm-Cat.\n\nA long time ago there lived in Tumpan\u00e9 a newly married couple. One evening as the wife was commencing to prepare her husband's dinner she heard the cry of a kalavedd\u00e1 (palm-cat) in a tree near the house, and, thinking if she could manage to catch it she might surprise her husband with a good meat curry, went out with the dog, saying \"usi, usi\" (urging on the dog). The dog ran to the foot of the tree barking and placed his forefeet on the trunk. She, thinking that he was trying to climb it, began to make him a valalla (a ring put round the ankles when climbing a tree). Just at that time the husband returned, and seeing what she was doing chid her for her foolishness, saying that 'he would shew her the way to get the dog up the tree.' Procuring a long stake he sharpened one end of it and sticking it into the dog hoisted him up to where the palm-cat was. The poor animal in agony whined b\u00e9! b\u00e9! \"Say not b\u00e9! b\u00e9! (I cannot, I cannot)\" said the man \"but lay hold of the palm-cat!\"\nRUINS AT VEHERAGALA.*\n\nThe ruins in question are known as \"Veheragala\" and are situated about two miles South of the 10th mile-post on the Anur\u0101dhapura road.\n\nThey consist for the most part of groups of stone pillars more or less roughly squared, and are probably the remains of palaces and Vih\u0101r\u0113s. The jungle is, however, so thick, and the ruins are so overgrown, that it is difficult to conjecture, from their formation, to what period they belong.\n\nThe only really interesting ruin which has so far been discovered, is that of an oval building, found upon a rocky mound, and the base of which is constructed of huge slabs of stone, (the shape of which is very peculiar) laid upon oblong blocks. They are cut into segments of a circle, each segment being 8 ft. to 12 ft. by 7 ft. \u00d7 7 in. or 8 in. thick. These slabs are also concave on the upper side and convex on the lower, but whether this was intentional, or the result of being wedged out of laminated rock\u2014with which the neighbourhood abounds,\u2014is not apparent. Another curious feature of the building is, that the oblong blocks upon which these slabs are laid, (and which seem to have formed the foundations) built upon the solid rock were morticed together, the sockets and notches being very distinct. The building faces North, on which side there is a flight of stone steps leading to the entrance, and its dimensions are, from North to South 56 feet, and from East to West 78 feet.\n\nIf this structure was intended for a Tope or D\u0101gaba\u2014which, considering that it was not circular, is, I think, unlikely\u2014it was never completed, and appears to have been temporarily used for some other purpose; for at the South end there are five spur stones, arranged in a curve, and upon which pillars must have\n\n* Extract from letter dated September 25th, 1882, from P.

As there are no remains of these pillars to be seen they were probably made of wood; and the debris of earth, bricks and tiles, which fill up the space inside the stone work, shows that a building of not very permanent character did exist at sometime.\n\nOn the slab rock near the flight of steps is an inscription, much of which was buried in earth. It is of the roughest kind and very difficult to copy in consequence. I have, however, had a copy made of it by Mr. F. Navaratna which I annex. The characters are not D\u00e9wan\u00e1gar\u00ed, though some of them bear some resemblance thereto.\n\nI annex tracing of a ground plan, sketched by Mr. C. T. D. Vigors, c.c.s., which gives the exact dimensions of the slabs forming the ring, and a very good idea of the elevation on the east side. A sketch is also annexed which I made from the top of a rock overlooking the building on the west side. This shows the peculiar shape of the slabs and the notches and sockets in the foundation blocks.*\n\n* The ground plan and inscription are here reproduced.\u2014Hon. Seo.\nTHE CONNECTION OF THE SINHALESE WITH THE MODERN \u00c1RYAN VERNACULARS OF INDIA.\n\nBy W. P. RA\u00d1ASINHA, Esq.\n\nIs Sinhalese to be placed under the Turanian family of languages with Tamil, Telugu, &c., or under the Indo-Germanic family, along with Hindi, Bengali, Panjabi, Sindhi, Marathi, Gujarathi, Nepali, Oriya, Assamese, and Kashmiri?\n\nThe Turanian family of languages has not got beyond the collocational or syntactical and agglutinated stages, whilst the Sinhalese has not only reached the inflectional stage, like Sanskrit, Greek and Latin, but has also advanced to the analytical, like the English, French, &c.: examples are \u0915\u0930\u093e\u092f\u093f, karayi, \"he does\"; \u092f\u093e\u092f\u093f, yayi, \"he goes\"; \u0926\u0947\u092f\u093f, deyi, \"he gives,\" &c. Here we find the stems \u0915\u0930\u093e, kara, \u092f\u093e, ya, and \u0926\u0947, de, which are derived from the Sanskrit roots \u0915\u0930\u093f, kri, \u092f\u093e, y\u00e1, and \u0926\u093e, d\u00e1, with an inflection \u092f\u093f, yi. This \u092f\u093f, yi, is again divisible into two parts \u092f\u093f, yi, and \u0907, i. The \u0907, i, is merely an augment adopted for the purpose of avoiding the hiatus which would otherwise occur if after the stem the \u0907, i, were pronounced alone. The \u0907, i, here is the remnant of \u0907, ti, in the Sanskrit verbs \u0915\u0930\u094b\u0924\u093f, karoti, \"he does\"; \u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u093f, bharati, \"he bears,\" &c. Mr. Beames points out that \u0907, ti, is equal to the English s in \"he bears, &c.\" In Greek \u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9, he says, we have i equal to the English pronoun \"he.\" In Latin fert the i is lost and t alone remains. In Gothic baireth we have th; here too the i is lost. In English \"beareth\" the i is lost, and the th alone remains. The English th and the Sinhalese i are parts of the same termination \u0907, ti. This th in English, he points out, is still further modified in the modern language into s as in \"bears,\" \"fears,\" &c. So the English s and the Sinhalese \u0907, i, in the third person singular number present tense of the indicative mood, can be traced to the \u00c1ryan \u0907, ti,\u2014the English taking the first part of the termination and further modifying\nit into s, the Sinhalese rejecting the first part, and taking the vowel alone, and inserting a \u03c9, y, to avoid the hiatus.\n\nThe \u03c9, y, in \u03c9\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9, karayi, &c., is an augment and not a substitute for \u03c9, t. We have in \u03c9\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9, ker\u00e9, \u03c9\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9, ye, and \u03c9\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9, de, other forms of the above verbs, meaning \u201che does,\u201d \u201che goes\u201d and \u201che gives.\u201d Here we find the \u03c9, i, without the \u03c9, y. By the rule of sandhi adigecornuvi, the vowel \u03c9, i, following the \u03c9, a, in \u03c9\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9, kara, \u03c9\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9+\u03c9+\u03c9, kar+a+i, becomes \u03c9, e, that is to say, both the \u03c9, a, and \u03c9, i, are lost, and \u03c9, e, is substituted in their place; hence the word \u03c9\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9, kare, and by the force of the vowel \u03c9, e, in \u03c9\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9, re, the word becomes \u03c9\u03ac\u0930\u03b9, ker\u00e9, \u201che does\u201d; similarly \u03c9\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9+\u03c9+\u03c9, y+a+i, becomes \u03c9\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9, ye, \u201che goes\u201d; and \u03c9\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9+\u03c9+\u03c9, d+a+i, becomes \u03c9\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9, de, \u201che gives.\u201d\n\nNow, although we never write \u03c9\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9, karai, \u03c9\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9, yai, and \u03c9\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9, dei, but \u03c9\u03ac\u0930\u03b9, karayi, \u03c9\u03ac\u0930\u03b9, yai, and \u03c9\u03ac\u0930\u03b9, deyi, yet they are pronounced \u03c9\u03ac\u0930\u03b9, karai, \u03c9\u03ac\u0930\u03b9, yai, and \u03c9\u03ac\u0930\u03b9, dei, as if they had been written so. This also is proof that the \u03c9, y, is merely an augment.\n\nIn the book language we have the following terminations:\n\n| Singular | Future |\n|----------|--------|\n| Present  |        |\n| 1. \u03c9\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9, harami, \u201cI do.\u201d | \u03c9\u03ac\u0930\u093f\u0928\u03b5\u03bc\u093f, karaunemi, \u201cI will do.\u201d |\n| 2. \u03c9\u03ac\u0930\u093f, herehi, \u201cYou do.\u201d | \u03c9\u03ac\u0930\u093f\u0928\u03b5\u0939\u093f, karannehi, \u201cYou will do.\u201d |\n| 3. \u03c9\u03ac\u0930\u093f, ker\u00e9, \u201cHe does.\u201d | \u03c9\u03ac\u0930\u093f\u0928\u0947, karanne, \u201cHe will do.\u201d |\n\n| Past |\n|------|\n| 1. \u03c9\u03ac\u0932\u03b5, hal\u00e9mi, \u201cI did.\u201d |\n| 2. \u03c9\u03ac\u0932\u0947\u0939\u093f, helehi, \u201cYou did.\u201d |\n| 3. \u03c9\u03ac\u0932\u0947, hele, \u201cHe did.\u201d |\n\nBut in the spoken language these perhaps were found to be a great encumbrance, and a form \u03c9\u03ac\u0930\u093e\u0935\u093e, karaaw\u00e1, has come to be used in the present and future tenses without any distinction as to number or person: and it is now necessary to say \u03c9\u03ac\u03c1\u093e\u0935\u093e, mama karaaw\u00e1, \u201cI do;\u201d \u03c9\u03ac\u03c1\u093e\u0935\u093e, u karanaw\u00e1, \u201che does;\u201d \u03c9\u03ac\u0930\u093e\u0935\u093e, mama het\u00e1 karaaw\u00e1, \u201cI will do to-morrow.\u201d Sometimes \u03c9\u03ac\u0930\u093e\u0935\u093e, kar\u00e1vi, and \u03c9\u03ac\u0930\u093e\u0935\u093e \u03c9\u093f, karaw\u00e1 \u03c9\u093f, are used. The past tense in the\ncolloquial is \u0dc0\u0dd9, kal\u00e1. This too having no inflections to shew the number or person, the pronouns have to be prefixed:\u2014\u0db8\u0dcf \u0dc0\u0dd9, mama kal\u00e1, \u201cI did\u201d; \u0d85\u0db4\u0dd2 \u0dc0\u0dd9, api kal\u00e1, \u201cwe did\u201d; \u0d94\u0dc0\u0dd4\u0db1\u0dca \u0dc0\u0dd9, i kal\u00e1, \u201che did,\u201d &c. We have here both the inflectional and analytical stages. Thus by classification Sinhalese must be grouped under the Indo-Germanic family. \u201cBut,\u201d it is said \u201cclassification is not in itself sufficient for purposes of analysis\u201d Let us therefore, look for other peculiarities. In the Turanian group, it is said that nouns are not distinct from verbs. In Sinhalese they are: \u0d9a\u0dbb, kara, \u0dba, ya, \u0daf, de, \u0db8\u0dda, s\u012b, &c.,\u2014are always verbs and never nouns; nor could a noun be converted into a verb except by the addition of a verb, as \u0db4\u0dd9\u0dbd\u0d9a\u0dbb\u0db8\u0dd2, pelakarami, \u201cI grow\u201d; \u0daf\u0dd2\u0dba\u0dcf\u0dc0\u0dda, diyaveyi, \u201cit becomes liquid\u201d; \u0daf\u0dd2\u0dba\u0d9a\u0dbb\u0db8\u0dd2, diyakarami, \u201cI liquify.\u201d\n\nAnother characteristic of the \u00c1ryan language, says Mr. Beames, is \u201cthat the noun possesses three numbers, singular, dual and plural; and numerous cases each distinguished by a peculiar and inseparable termination.\u201d\n\nWe have in Sinhalese only the singular and the plural numbers, the dual is lost, as in English. The case endings are inseparable, that is to say, if separated from the stem, as \u0db8\u0dcf, ta, in \u0db8\u0dcf, ma\u1e6da, \u201cto me,\u201d they have no meaning in themselves, and here the \u0db8\u0dcf, ta, when separated has no meaning in itself.\n\nWe have the following terminations in nouns:\n\n**Masculine**\n\n\u0db8\u0dcf, m\u0101, \u201cMan.\u201d\n\n| Singular | Plural |\n|----------|--------|\n| Nom. \u0db8\u0dcf, \u0101 | \u0db8\u0dcf, hu |\n| Acc. \u0db8\u0dcf, d | \u0db8\u0dcf, un |\n| Inst. \u0db8\u0dcf (\u0db8\u0dcf), d (visin) | \u0db8\u0dcf (\u0db8\u0dcf), un (visin) |\n| Loc. \u0db8\u0dcf, \u0101 | \u0db8\u0dcf, un |\n| Dat. \u0db8\u0dcf, \u0101 | \u0db8\u0dcf, un |\n| Abl. \u0db8\u0dcf, \u0101gen | \u0db8\u0dcf, ungen |\n| Gen. \u0db8\u0dcf, \u0101ge | \u0db8\u0dcf, unge |\n| Voc. \u0db8\u0dcf, \u0101, \u0113 | \u0db8\u0dcf, un |\nFeminine,\n\u0d9c\u0dda g\u0113ni, \"Woman.\"\n\nSing. | Plur.\n---|---\nNom. | \u0db8, mi, u, \u014d\nAcc. | \u0db8, mi\nInst. | \u0db8, mi\nAux. | \u0db8, ta\nDat. | \u0db8, ta\nAbl. | \u0db8, gen\nGen. | \u0db8, g\u00e9\nLoc. | \u0db8, a\nVoc. | \u0db8, a\n\nNeuter\n\u0d9c\u0dc3, gas, \"Tree.\"\n\nSingular | Plural\n---|---\nNom. | \u0db8, a\nAcc. | \u0db8, a\nInst. | \u0db8, a\nAux. | \u0db8, en\nDat. | \u0db8, ala\nAbl. | \u0db8, en\nGen. | \u0db8, \u00e9\nLoc. | \u0db8, \u00e9\nVoc. | \u0db8, a\n\nThe verb has three forms for the three persons and no forms for the three genders. Thus:\u2014\n\u0db8\u0dd9\u0db8\u0dca, \u0db8\u0dd9\u0db8\u0dca, \u0db8\u0dd9\u0db8\u0dca, \"he goes\"\n\u0db8\u0dd9\u0db8\u0dca, \u0db8\u0dd9\u0db8\u0dca, \u0db8\u0dd9\u0db8\u0dca, \"she goes\"; \u0db8\u0dd9\u0db8\u0dca, \u0db8\u0dd9\u0db8\u0dca, \u0db8\u0dd9\u0db8\u0dca, \"the ship goes.\"\n\n\"In the \u00c1ryan languages the personal terminations of the verb are abraded pronouns, or rather pronominal types.\" So are they in Sinhalese.\n\nIn Pr\u00e1krit the terminations are:\n\nPresent Tense.\n\nSingular.\n1. \u0db8\u0dd9\u0db8\u0dca, mi as \u0db8\u0dd9\u0db8\u0dca, hasami, \"I smile\"\n2. \u0db8\u0dd9\u0db8\u0dca, si as \u0db8\u0dd9\u0db8\u0dca, hasani, \"You smile\"\n3. \u0db8\u0dd9\u0db8\u0dca, i as \u0db8\u0dd9\u0db8\u0dca, hasai, \"He smiles\"\n\nPlural.\n1. \u0db8\u0dd9\u0db8\u0dca, mo, mu, as \u0db8\u0dd9\u0db8\u0dca, hasimu, \"We smile\"\n2. \u0db8\u0dd9\u0db8\u0dca, ha, as \u0db8\u0dd9\u0db8\u0dca, hasaha, \"Ye smile\"\n3. \u0db8\u0dd9\u0db8\u0dca, anti, as \u0db8\u0dd9\u0db8\u0dca, hasanti, \"They smile\"\nThe terminations of the future tense are the same, with icasa, prefixed to them.\n\n\"Another striking characteristic of this family,\" says Mr. Beames, \"is its power of expressing complicated ideas or strings of ideas by compounds. Several words are joined together, and the case and tense-endings are added to the last word only, the first member of the compound being either a preposition or a noun, or even a verb. This power is not possessed by other families.\" This power the Sinhalese language possesses in a preeminent degree, Bamba suranar\u00f3 namadit, given in the Sidat Sangar\u00e1 is a familiar example.\n\nI have here attempted to shew that most of the characteristics of the \u00c1ryan languages do also apply to the modern Sinhalese.\n\nThe following languages, as was said before, belong to the Indic class of the Indo-Germanic family, Hind\u00ed, Beng\u00e1li, Panj\u00e1b\u00ed, Sindh\u00ed, Mar\u00e1th\u00ed, Gujar\u00e1th\u00ed, Oriya, and Kashmir\u00ed. Following Mr. Beames' excellent work on the Philology of these languages I shall endeavour to shew the connection of Sinhalese with this family.\n\nThe numerals, says Mr. Beames, are those parts of speech which retain their forms with the greatest tenacity, and offer the most obvious similarities. Let us compare the Sinhalese with the Indian vernacular numerals.\n| Sanskrit | Bengali | Sinhalese (Old) | Sinhalese (Modern) |\n|----------|---------|-----------------|--------------------|\n| 1. \u0113ka   | \u00e9k -    | eka             | eka                |\n| 2. dwi   | dui     | de              | de                 |\n| 3. tri   | tin     | t\u016bna or te      | t\u016bna               |\n| 4. chatur | ch\u0101ri   | s\u012bva            | s\u012bl\u0101ra             |\n| 5. pa\u00f1cha | p\u0101uch   | pasu            | pahu               |\n| 6. shash | s\u0101t     | saha            | ha                 |\n| 7. sapta | \u0101\u1e6dh     | a\u1e6dha            | hata               |\n| 8. ashta | n\u014dy     | nava            | navu               |\n| 9. navan | da\u1e63     | dasa            | nama               |\n| 10. da\u1e63un| egar    | eko\u1e37osa         | eko\u1e37aha            |\n| 11. \u1e5bk\u0101da\u1e63a| b\u0101ro    | bara            | do\u1e37aha             |\n| 12. dv\u0101da\u1e63a| ter\u014d    | teles           | tera               |\n| 13. trayoda\u1e63a| ch\u0101rudda| tudusa          | dahatuna           |\n| 14. chaturda\u1e63a| ponera| panara          | pahalos            |\n| 15. panchada\u1e63a| sh\u014dla| solos           | dahasaya           |\n| 16. saptada\u1e63a| sat\u0113ra| satalos         | dahahala           |\n| 17. asht\u0101da\u1e63a| \u012b\u1e6dh\u0101ra| \u0101\u1e6dhalos         | dah\u0101\u1e6da             |\n| 18. \u1e5bnavin\u1e63ati| \u016bnis| ekunvisi       | dah\u0101navaya         |\n| 19. vi\u1e63ati| vi\u1e63a   | visi            | visi               |\n| 20. trin\u1e63at| tri\u1e63a  | t\u012bsa            | tiha               |\n| 30. chatw\u0101ri\u1e47\u1e63at| chall\u012bga| s\u0101\u1e6d\u012bs           | hataliha           |\n| 40. pa\u00f1ch\u0101\u1e63at| panch\u0101sa| s\u0101\u1e6d\u012bs           | panaha             |\n| 50. shasht\u012b| s\u0101\u1e6d\u012bs   | sa\u1e6da            | he\u1e6da               |\n| 60. saptati| sattura| satt\u0113            | hette              |\n| 70. asht\u012b| \u0101\u1e6di     | os\u016b              | as\u016b                |\n| 80. navati| nabbai | an\u016b              | an\u016b                |\n| 90. sata  | saya    | siya            | siya               |\n| 100. sata | saya    | siya            | siya               |\nIt will be perceived at a glance that the Sinhalese has followed the Pr\u0101k\u1e5bit very closely with the exception of the changes peculiar to the language.\n\nIn the Maldavian language the numerals are almost the same as in the Sinhalese. The difference, as far as I am aware, is that the progression in that language is by duodecimals instead of decimals. They are eken, den, tine\u00f1, hataren, pahen, hayen, hate\u00f1, aren, nuven, dihen, ekolahen, dolahen. Here they stop and for thirteen they have dolos eken, which means \u201ctwelve + one.\u201d This is continued up to \u201ctwenty-three\u201d which is dolos ekolos, and twenty-four is passihi: now passihi is evidently the same as the Sinhalese paswisi, which means \u201ctwenty-five.\u201d They proceed on with passihi eken, passihi den, &c., and their \u201cthirty-six\u201d is tindolos, (i.e., three twelves.) Their \u201cforty-eight\u201d is panas, which is the Sinhalese for \u201cfifty;\u201d their \u201csixty\u201d is pasdolos, (i.e., five twelves); \u201ceighty-four\u201d is hayidolos, (i.e., seven twelves; \u201cninety six\u201d is hiya, which is the same as the Sinhalese siya, \u201chundred.\u201d The real \u201chundred,\u201d however, they call sata, which is the P\u0101li form of the Sanskrit \u015bata, from which the Sinhalese siya, is derived through the Pr\u0101k\u1e5bit saya, as we have seen.*\n\nIn the Dravidian group the Telugu and the Tamil, I believe, stand foremost. The numerals in these two languages are:\n\n| Telugu | Tamil |\n|--------|-------|\n| 1      | ondu  | onru. |\n| 2      | rendu | irandu. |\n| 3      | m\u00e1du | mun\u1e0du. |\n| 4      | n\u00e1tugu | n\u00e1lu. |\n| 5      | aidu | aindu. |\n| 6      | \u00e1ru | \u00e1ru. |\n| 7      | \u00e9du | \u00e9fu. |\n| 8      | enimudu | efu. |\n| 9      | tommidi | ompadu. |\n| 10     | padi | pattu. |\n| 20     | iruvai | irupadu. |\n| 30     | muppai | muppadu. |\n| 40     | n\u00e1lpatu | n\u00e1padu. |\n\n* Note.\u2014\u201cMaldive Numerals\u201d\u2014Hon.

By reducing the \u1e63, s, into \u1e6d, h, and dropping it altogether, the \u0936\u0947\u091c, jj\u0101, is reduced to \u0936\u0947\u091c, da, and to compensate for the loss of the conjunct consonant, the vowel \u090f, e, is substituted. This is more apparent when we compare the Sinhalese \u0936\u0947\u091c, enda, with the old Hindi sayy\u0101\u2014the modern Hindi, Panjabi, and Sindhi being sej.\n\nIn Pr\u00e1krit, which, as Professor Max M\u00fcller says, is the basis of all the \u00c1ryan vernaculars of India, consonants are dropped in the middle of words; as visai for vinsati, twenty. In Sinhalese the hiatus is always avoided by the coalition of the letters or by the insertion of the semivowels \u1e5b, ya, or \u1e0d, va, and sometimes \u1e5b, ra; \u0930\u0924\u0928\u093e, ratana, \"cubit,\" Sinhalese \u0930\u093f\u092f\u093e\u0928\u093e, riyana; \u0915\u0925\u092f\u0924\u093f, kathayati, \"he says,\" Sinhalese \u0915\u093f\u092f\u093e\u0908, kiyayi.

O. id.; Sin. \u0905\u091f\u093e, ata.\n\nThe following rules may be deduced from the above and other peculiarities of the language.\n\n1. That pure Sinhalese retains all the Sanskrit vowels except \u0930\u093f, ri, \u0932\u094d\u0930\u093f, lri, \u0905\u0908, ai, \u0913\u0908, au: ri becomes either \u0930\u093f, a, \u0930\u093f, i, or \u0930\u093f, u, or \u0930\u093f, iri, sometimes \u0930\u093f, ru; as \u0924\u092a\u093e, \"grass,\" for\ntrina, idu, \"straight,\" for riju, utu, \"season,\" for ritu, rusi, for rishi.\n\n2. ai, becomes e, as hela, \"mount,\" for saila.\n\n3. au, becomes o, as sonduru, saundaryya, \"comely.\"\n\n4. A long vowel is generally shortened as ek, \"one,\" for eka; solos, \"sixteen,\" for s\u00f4da\u015ba; maga, \"road\" for m\u00e1rga; isuru, \"lord\" for \u00eeswara.\n\n5. The dental sibilent s represents the palatal and the lingual; as visi, \"twenty,\" for vi\u00f1\u1e63ati; seta, \"sixty,\" for shashti; sa, \"six\" for shash.\n\n6. Aspirated consonants are reduced to their unaspirated sounds, sometimes with h, to compensate for the loss of the aspirate; as bima, \"land,\" for bhumi; vidi, \"manner,\" for vidhi; d\u00eahena, \"religious meditation,\" for dhy\u00e2na.\n\n7. cha, is changed either to sa, or da, sometimes to ta; as satara, \"four\" for chatur; pas, \"five\" for pa\u00f1cha; goduru, \"an object of sense,\" for gochara; tudus, \"fourteen,\" for chaturdasa. The change of cha, to sa, is not peculiar to the Sinhalese alone: it is a feature of the Bengali and Marathi too. Mr. Beames says, \"In Eastern Bengal, where the pronunciation reaches the utmost limits of corruption, chha is regularly sounded as s, and in that dialect of Bengal spoken in Assam, not only has the s sound driven out the chha but also has in many cases still further passed into h.\" So it is in Sinhalese; sanda, \"moon,\" from Sanskrit chandra, is reduced to anda, handa; pa\u00f1cha, \"five\" is pasa, and reduced further into paha; dasa, \"ten\" becomes daha. This ha is sometimes still further reduced in Sinhalese, by dropping it altogether and retaining only its inherent\nvowel, e.g., Sanskrit, \u0936\u092f\u094d\u092f\u093e, sayy\u0101, \"bed\"; Pr\u00e1krit, sejja; Sinhalese, \u0dc3\u0dd9\u0db1\u0dcf, \u0113nda, the first form of which seems to have been \u0dc3\u0dd9\u0db1\u0dcf, s\u0113nda, then \u0dc3\u0dd9\u0db1\u0dcf, h\u0113nda, and now \u0dc3\u0dd9\u0db1\u0dcf, \u0113nda.\n\n8. \u091c, ja, is often changed to \u091a, da; as \u0932\u093e\u091c, laja, \"parched grain,\" Sinhalese, \u0dbd\u0da2, lada; \u0da2\u0dbd, j\u00e1la, \"net,\" Sinhalese, \u0da2\u0dbd, d\u0113la.\n\n9. The Sanskrit conjunct consonant \u0917\u0903, g\u00f1a, is changed in P\u00e1li to \u0928, na, which is changed in Sinhalese to \u0db1, n; as \u0917\u094d\u0928\u093e\u0928, g\u00f1\u0101na \"wisdom,\" P\u00e1li, \u0928\u093e\u0928\u093e, n\u0101na, Sinhalese, \u0db1\u0dcf\u0db1, n\u0113na, \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0917\u094d\u0928\u093e\u0928, prag\u00f1\u0101, \"wisdom,\" P\u00e1li, \u092a\u093e\u0928\u0928\u093e, pa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101, Sinhalese, \u0db4\u0db1\u0db1, pena.\n\n10. \u0921, \u1e0d, and \u0930, r, are changed to \u0932, l, in Pr\u00e1krit; and Sinhalese adopts it, e.g., \u0936\u0924\u0930\u0941\u0919\u094d\u0917, \u015batru\u1e45ga, \"sixteen,\" for \u0936\u0924\u0930\u0941\u0919\u094d\u0917, shatru\u1e45ga; \u0924\u0947\u0932, teles, \"thirteen,\" for \u0924\u0947\u0930\u0938, terasa; \u0905\u0920\u093e\u0930\u0938, atalos, \"eighteen,\" for \u0905\u0920\u093e\u0930\u0938, ath\u0101rasa. Sinhalese also changes \u091f, \u1e6d, into \u0932, l, as \u0d9a\u0dbb\u0d9a\u0da7\u0d9a, karka\u1e6daka, Sinhalese, \u0d9a\u0d9a\u0dd4\u0dbd, kakulu, \"crab.\"\n\n11. Pr\u00e1krit (in which is included P\u00e1li) always reduces conjunct consonants of different classes to one class: this is done by eliding one and doubling the other; \u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e, dharma, \"scriptures,\" is written \u0927\u092e\u094d\u092e, dhamma; \u0905\u0936\u094d\u0935, aswa, \"horse\" is written \u0905\u0938\u094d\u0935, assa; \u092e\u0942\u0921, mudga, \"kidney beans,\" is \u092e\u0942\u0921, mugga; \u092a\u0941\u0923\u094d\u092f, punya, \"merit,\" is \u092a\u0941\u0923\u094d\u092f, pu\u1e47ya, in Pr\u00e1krit, and \u092a\u0941\u0923\u094d\u092f, pu\u1e47ya in P\u00e1li; \u092e\u0924\u094d\u0938\u094d\u092f, matsya, \"fish,\" is written \u092e\u091a\u094d\u091b, machchha. The Sinhalese still further reduces these to single consonants by eliding one of them; as \u0926\u092e, dam, or \u0926\u0939\u092e, daham, \"scriptures\"; \u0905\u0936\u094d\u0935, as, \"horse;\" \u092e\u0942\u0921, mungu, \"kidney beans;\" \u092a\u0941\u0923\u094d\u092f, pin, \"merits\" \u092e\u0924\u094d\u0938\u094d\u092f, masu, \"fish.\"\n\n12. In Pr\u00e1krit, consonants are elided in the middle or end of words, and sometimes in the beginning also; but in Sinhalese the hiatus thus occurring is avoided either by the coalition of the vowel or by the insertion of semi-vowels: thus, \u0924\u094d\u0930\u093f\u0932\u094b\u0915\u094d\u092f, trail\u014dkya, \"the three worlds,\" is in Pr\u00e1krit teloa, but in Sinhalese we find \u0924\u093f\u0932\u094b\u0935, tilova. Here we have the semi-vowel \u0909, u, inserted between the vowels o and a. For the Sanskrit nabha\u015btala, \"sky,\" we find in Pr\u00e1krit nahaala, where both the b and the nexus st are lost. The Sinhalese avoids the\naspirate eliding the first letter of the conjunct consonant, and we get \u0db1\u0dd4\u0db6\u0dad\u0dbd, nubatala. Pr\u0101k\u1e5bit, naa, \u201cnine,\u201d Sinhalese, \u0db1\u0dc0 nava; Pr\u0101k\u1e5bit, visai, \u201ctwenty,\u201d Sinhalese, \u0dc0\u0dd2\u0dc3\u0dd3 visi.\n\n13. The Sinhalese sound \u03f5, e, comes into play when a long \u03c9, \u00e1, or \u03c9, \u00e9, is shortened, or a nexus preceded by \u03c9, a, is elided, e.g., \u0905\u0937\u094d\u091f\u093e\u0926\u094d\u0935, \u0101\u015b\u0101\u1e0dha, \u201cname of a month (June and July),\u201d \u0908\u0938\u0932\u093e, esala; \u092e\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093f\u0915\u093e, makshik\u0101, \u201cfly,\u201d \u092e\u0947\u0938\u0940, mesi; \u0939\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093f\u0928, hastin, \u201celephant,\u201d \u090f\u0924, et; \u0936\u0924\u094d\u0924\u0940, shashti, \u201csixty\u201d \u0939\u0947\u0924\u093e, het\u0101. It is also a substitute for \u03c9, e, as velli, \u201ccreeper\u201d Sinhalese \u0d91\u0dbd, vel. Though in Beng\u0101l\u012b and other vernaculars of India there is no letter corresponding to the Sinhalese \u03f5, e, yet Mr. Beames says:\u2014\u201cIn some instances in Beng\u0101l\u012b the vowel \u03c9, e, has a short harsh sound, like that of English a in hat. Thus ek, \u201cone,\u201d sounds yak or ack.\u201d This is just what the Sinhalese \u03f5, e, is: the vowel changes entirely depend upon the preceding or succeeding vowels of a word.\n\nThe following examples will shew that a large number of words with slight modifications, is common to all. I work on the materials supplied by Beames.\n\nSk\u1e5b.* karka\u1e6daka \u201ccrab;\u201d P\u0101li, kakka\u1e6da; S. k\u00e1nki\u1e0do; H. kekara; Sin. kakulu, \u201csea crab.\u201d\n\nSk\u1e5b. karka\u1e6dika; \u201ccucumber;\u201d P\u0101. kakk\u0101ri; S. kakid\u012b; H. kakad\u012b; O., B. kakud\u012b; Sin. k\u0113kiri.\n\nSk\u1e5b. karbura, \u201cvariegated;\u201d S. kubiro; H. kab\u0101ra, kaba-ra; Sin. kabara.\n\nSk\u1e5b. ksha\u1e47a; \u201cmoment;\u201d S. khi\u1e47a; H. khana, kha\u1e47a, chha\u1e47a; Sin. ke\u1e47a, s\u0113na.

Beyond 10 a modified form of the Hind\u00fast\u00e1n\u00ed decimal numeration is that in common use. Some confusion, however, arises from the co-existence of the two systems; thus, fanas or fans\u00e1s may be either 48 or 50; hiya or sat\u00e9ka, 96 or 100.\" (\"The M\u00e1l\u0111ive Islands,\" Sessional Papers, Ceylon, 1881, p. 121.)\n\nMr. Albert Gray in giving the M\u00e1l\u0111ive numerals recorded by Pyrard with their Sinhalese equivalents, adds, in a foot note:\u2014\"After this number Pyrard has the following:\u2014\u2018Note that they have the numbers up to twelve (as we have them up to ten): then they go on by twelves, and their hundred is 96, or eight times 12.\u2019 It will be seen by the numbers which follow that those only which are correct according to Sinhalese enumeration are compounds of dolos, viz., tin dolos, passedolos, and addolos. They are simply, \u2018three dozen\u2019, \u2018five dozen\u2019, and \u2018seven dozen\u2019. On the other hand, those which are not compounds of dolos are altered values of the ordinary Sinhalese decimal numbers. Yet it is strange that Pyrard could make mistakes with numbers so low as \u2018twenty-four\u2019 and \u2018forty-eight\u2019 which by analogy ought to be dedolos and h\u00e1radolos...... It seems that the Maldivians count much by dozens; indeed, Christopher (Trans. Bom. Geog. Soc. 1836-8, p. 69) says,\n\n* Mr. Ranasingha's paragraph (p. 241) on M\u00e1l\u0111ive numerals justifies this note.\u2014B. Hon. Sec.\n'they reckon by twelves, as we do by tens;' but they have not abandoned altogether the decimal system. If, however, passee and panas really stand for 'twenty-four' and 'forty-eight,' it will be interesting to know the Maldive for 'twenty' and 'fifty.'\" (Journ. R. A. S., Vol. viii. n. s. 1878, pp. 193-4.)\n\nMr. Ranasingha has rightly shown, from a comparison with the Sinhalese, the true meaning and value of the forms, fassehi, fanas, and hiya; but it is difficult to account for the anomaly of their employment in a duo-decimal system, otherwise than as relics of an original decimal numeration, which, from unknown causes, was temporarily abandoned, only to reassert itself, though under a different garb more closely resembling other \u00c1ryan vernaculars than Sinhalese.\n\nThe following table of M\u00e1ldives numerals exhibits both systems:\u2014\n| Duo-decimal | Decimal |\n|-------------|---------|\n| 1           | eke'    |\n| 2           | de'     |\n| 3           | tine'   |\n| 4           | hatare' |\n| 5           | fahe'   |\n| 6           | haye'   |\n| 7           | hate'   |\n| 8           | arhe'   |\n| 9           | nuvaye' |\n| 10          | dihaye' |\n| 11          | ekolohe'|\n| 12          | dolohe' |\n| 13          | dolos-eke' |\n| 14          |         |\n| 15          |         |\n| 16          |         |\n| 17          |         |\n| 18          | &c.,    |\n| 19          |         |\n| 20          |         |\n| 21          |         |\n| 22          |         |\n| 23          |         |\n| 24          | fassehi |\n| 25          | fassehi-eke' |\n| 26          |         |\n| 27          |         |\n| 28          |         |\n| 29          |         |\n| 30          | &c.,    |\n| 31          |         |\n| 32          |         |\n| 33          |         |\n| 34          |         |\n| 35          |         |\n| 36          | tin-dolos |\n| 37          | tin-dolos-eke' |\n| 38          |         |\n| 39          |         |\n| 40          |         |\n| 41          |         |\n| 42          | &c.,    |\n| 43          |         |\n| 44          |         |\n| 45          |         |\n| 46          |         |\n| 47          |         |\n\n\u2020 Transcribed from a list given in a M\u00e1ldives tartib, or commentary on the kur\u00e1n.\u2014B.

P. Bell, Esq., Hon. Secretary.\n\n1.\u2014Read and confirmed Minutes of last Meeting,\n\n2.\u2014The Hon. Secretary stated, that on assuming duties he found that the \"Proceedings\" of the Society had not been published (with the exception of the President's Address for 1879, printed in the Journal for 1880, Part I.) since 1873-4. He proposed to issue shortly in pamphlet form the \"Proceedings, 1875 to 1880.\"* An effort would be made in future to publish the Society's \"Proceedings\" regularly at the close of each year.\u2014Approved.\n\n3.\u2014With reference to the long delay in the issue of a new Catalogue of the C. A. S. Library, the Hon. Secretary laid before the Meeting a rough manuscript Catalogue, on which the Librarian of the Museum had been long engaged, and expressed his opinion that, if printed in its present form, it would be unsuited to fulfil the purpose of sure and ready reference. Under the circumstances it was hoped that additional delay for the preparation of a satisfactory Catalogue would be held justifiable. The Hon. Secretary consented to devote such attention to this work, as leisure might allow him.\n\n4.\u2014The Meeting was informed that the stock of several back Numbers of the Society's Journal had become exhausted\u2014not a single copy remaining even in the C. A. S. Library,\u2014viz., 1848-9; 1849-50; 1853 (1 pt.); 1856 8 (2 pts.); 1858-9; 1860-1; 1870-1. The Honorary Secretary had addressed Government (January 13th), with a view to obtaining permission for the said Journals to be reprinted at the Government Press, from copies kindly placed at his service by D. Ferguson, Esq., and the boon had been readily granted (January 20th).\n\n5.\u2014In order to put an end to the present confusion arising from the irregular numbering and paging of past Journals, it was suggested\n\n* Issued in March, 1881.\nby the Hon. Secretary that the Committee should once for all sanction an authoritative numbering and division of the series.\n\nApproved, and the matter left entirely in the hands of the Hon. Secretary.*\n\n6.\u2014The Hon. Secretary stated that on going over the Books, &c., belonging to the Library, he discovered that a large proportion required immediate binding or re-binding, and moved for a special vote under this head.\n\nThe Committee sanctioned an expenditure of Rs. 200, to be devoted to this object.\n\n7.\u2014It was notified by the Hon. Secretary that, in accordance with Resolution 2, passed at the Committee Meeting held July 16th, 1880, the Sub-Committee had met, and selected new Books for the Library to the value of \u00a350; and that the order had been sent to Messrs.

It was a pity that more Members were not present, as the Papers read were interesting. Those Papers were, however, too numerous to allow of free discussion upon them.\nThe first Paper read was by Mr. S. Mervin, a Jaffna Tamil, upon \"Hind\u00fa Astronomy as compared with the European science.\" The reader spent some time in apologising for his lack of eloquence and learning, and then read extracts from his Paper. The study of Astrology, he said, was cultivated by the immediate descendants of Adam; Josephus informed us that the sons of Seth were engaged in studying Astronomy. From the Egyptians the science passed to the Greeks. It seemed to have gone from Chaldea to India and China 2,000 years B.C. The records of the efforts of the early Indian Astronomers were, however, wrapt in obscurity. At first the Hind\u00fas thought the earth was round, and that the eclipses of the moon were caused by the earth's shadow. Some, however, maintained that the earth, though round, was at rest in the centre. A few believed that the earth was flat. Mr. Mervin then referred to the principles put forward by Ptolemy, and proceeded to show that Hind\u00fa astronomy was very different from its mythology. After a short dip into Hind\u00fa mythology he turned more directly to the real subject of the paper. Many doctrines of Hind\u00fa astronomy, he said corresponded with European science. The laws of gravitation were known to the Hind\u00fas long before Sir Isaac Newton's time. The Hind\u00fas believed ages ago that the atmosphere extended 60 miles from the earth, and he reminded them that European science had decided that the atmosphere could not extend more than 50 or 60 miles. He quoted from several old Tamil works to show that a great many years ago the Hind\u00fas held very similar opinions as to the planets as those held by the Europeans of to-day.\n\nMr. George Wall, (after one or two Members had expressed their interest in the Paper read) said he presumed that no one would imagine that any facts stated touching the alleged discovery of the laws of gravitation before Sir Isaac Newton's time were true. That the movements of the planets were well known was of course admitted, as they were mentioned in the old astronomical books and in the Scriptures. Facts of observation were very different from those laws which govern the movements of planets. He concluded that Mr. Mervin did not profess to state that the laws of gravitation were really known by the ancient Hind\u00fas. If such an allegation were made for a moment, the fact that the Hind\u00fas thought that the sun revolved round the earth would explode the idea. That one fact was sufficient to show that the laws of gravitation were not in the slightest degree understood in olden times by the Hind\u00fas. He was quite aware that the ancients had a pretty accurate knowledge of the movements of the planets, but they did not know the causes. About the time of the transit of Venus a very learned gentleman in Colombo said to him that he could not understand why the Government were taking so many observations and spending so much money and trouble in doing so, seeing that they knew exactly when the transit would take place. When the speaker told this gentleman that they did not yet know what distance Venus and the sun were from the earth, which it was very important to ascertain, he was quite astonished. They could easily tell the exact time shown by the town clock in the tower, but they could not so easily tell the exact diameter of the face. They know the exact movements and causes of the eclipses, but the laws of gravitation were a profound secret till the days of Sir Isaac Newton.\n\nMr. Smither then read his Paper upon \"Some ruins at Horana.\"\n\nMr. H. C. P. Bell (Hon Sec.) read Mr. A. C. Dixon's Paper on \"Gold in Ceylon.\"\nA few \"Sinhalese proverbs,\" from a large number of specimens by L. De Zoyza, Mah\u00e1-Mudaliy\u00e1r, were read by Mr. Ranasiqha, in the absence of the Mah\u00e1-Mudaliy\u00e1r.\n\nSamuel Jayatilaka Mudaliy\u00e1r's Paper on \"Bee Culture in Ceylon\" was read by the Hon. Secretary.\n\nThe Hon. the Chairman proposed a vote of thanks to those gentlemen who had written or read Papers. He said that they had had such a number of Papers that it had been almost impossible to pause and discuss the merits of any of them. He quite concurred with the remarks of Mr. Wall as to the knowledge of the Hind\u00fas as to gravitation. Upon such a point they might have had a free discussion had there been time.\n\nMr. Wall remarked that he was not quite clear whether Mr. Mervin wished to imply that the Hind\u00fas really understood the laws of gravitation. He proceeded (to Mr. Mervin): \"Do we understand that your belief is that the laws of gravitation, as propounded and explained by Newton, were understood by the ancient Hind\u00fas?\"\n\nMr. Mervin: \"As in other cases the principle was understood by the Hind\u00fas, but not as improved and made perfect since in the form of a system. The principle was understood.\"\n\nThe Hon. P. R\u00e1ma-N\u00e1than: \"The idea is that the Hind\u00fas should be credited with having conceived the first ideas of the laws of gravitation.\"\n\nMr. Wall: \"But none of the extracts he has read bear him out: rather the opposite. The figures as to the dimensions of the earth and the times of the eclipses were ascertained by observation without any knowledge of the laws of gravitation whatever. The fact that a year consists of 365 days and so many hours could be ascertained without any knowledge of the laws of astronomy. No doubt astronomical observations were carried to a very high degree of perfection and for a very great period of time, but there has not been anything said to show that the laws or principles of gravitation were ever propounded before Sir Isaac Newton discovered them. People may find out by observation that a clock goes, and also find out what the movements indicate, but that does not prove what works the inside of it.\"\n\nMr. Mervin, to illustrate his meaning, remarked that algebra was in existence among the Hind\u00fas ages since, but not in such perfection as among Europeans of the present day. And so attraction or gravitation was known to the Hind\u00fas. He did not say the laws of gravitation were known to perfection.\n\nMr. Wall: \"But it is the law which is everything in this case.\"\n\nMr. Mervin: \"It says in one of the passages I read that 'the earth is standing by its own inherent force.' What is meant by 'inherent force?'\"\n\nMr. Wall: \"The idea of gravitation first of all is shown with bodies having no motion. They must derive their motion from something. The first step towards gravitation is that bodies do not move at all unless they are moved by something. The facts were known, but your facts were obtained by observation, while Sir Isaac Newton's theory was laid down, whereby those facts could be confirmed and understood. Sir Isaac laid aside for 20 years his idea of the laws of gravitation because they did not agree with observation. No one had the slightest conception of the theory till Sir Isaac found it out. Then the whole thing became clear. The facts\nof observation were constantly coming into contact with the theory. The laws of gravitation required that certain motions should take place by a certain planet while the facts of observation were utterly opposed to it. It was afterwards discovered that there was another planet existing beyond the one expected to change, and upon which it acted. Thus the further planet was discovered. The law of gravitation was one theory, simply enounced; not a gradually worked out fact like geometry, about which there is no principle. The law of gravitation as discovered by Newton has never been altered. When, apparently, facts were opposed to it, as in the case of the new planet, further observations by the aid of the most complete instruments have shown that the laws of gravitation were perfectly correct, the apparently contradictory facts being explained after observation. No ancient Hind\u00fa, as far as at present known, ever had the slightest inkling of knowledge of those laws. None of their facts required a knowledge of those laws.\"\n\nThe subject then dropped.*\n\nThe Hon. the Chairman said that was the last Meeting at which he would be present for some time, as he was about to leave for England. It was very gratifying to be able to leave the Society in such a flourishing state.\n\n* Mr. Mervin subsequently published the following letter in the columns of the Observer:\n\nDear Sir,\u2014A portion of the Essay on Hind\u00fa Astronomy read by me at the Asiatic Society Meeting of the 7th instant, runs\u2014\"The laws of gravitation were known to the Hind\u00fas long before Sir Isaac Newton was born.\" The Hind\u00fa Astronomer B\u00e1skara-\u00e1s\u00e1riy\u00e1r was born in the year 1114, A.D., and composed the treatise called \"Siddh\u00e1nta Sir\u00f3mapi\" in 1150. In the 6th verse of the 3rd chapter of that book, the author says:\u2014\"The property of attraction is inherent in the earth. By this property, the earth attracts any unsupported heavy thing towards it. The thing appears to be falling, but it is in a state of being drawn to the earth,\" &c.\n\nSir Isaac Newton was born in the year 1642, A.D., and made the discovery of the laws of gravitation in 1703.\n\nDoes not the above quoted verse elicit that attraction of gravitation (if not the laws thereof) was known to B\u00e1skara-\u00e1s\u00e1riy\u00e1r 492 years before Newton was born? Why should any one hesitate to acknowledge this? I do not say that the laws of gravitation in their entirety were known to the Hind\u00fas. If one believes that the above verse was written by B\u00e1skara-\u00e1s\u00e1riy\u00e1r, could he doubt that the principles of attraction were known to him?\n\nShould it be said that B\u00e1skara-\u00e1s\u00e1riy\u00e1r knew this merely from his observation, and not scientifically, the Hind\u00fas would say that even so much was not known to the western nations before Sir Isaac Newton's time; for Sir Isaac deduced the attraction from his observation of the fall of an apple. Is it not clear that no European that lived before him did ever observe the fall of an apple, and therefrom deduce the earth's attractive power? Most sciences and arts are discovered by observation. Man derives his knowledge from observation, conversation, reading and meditation; observation being the first medium. It is therefore no wonder that B\u00e1skara-\u00e1s\u00e1riy\u00e1r\nDuring his absence, Mr. Wall, the Vice-President, would assume the Chair, and he was sure Mr. Wall would take an interest in everything affecting the Society, and contribute by his well stored mind to its benefit. He thanked the Members for the confidence shown in him by his being elected upon so many occasions as President, and assured them that he should always have the welfare of the Society at heart. At home he hoped to be of any use possible. He should try to get such Books, &c., as the Hon. Secretary might wish to obtain. He desired before leaving to recommend one very old Member who had held various offices in the Society the Mah\u00e1-Mud\u00e1liy\u00e1r, Louis De Zoyza, for nomination as an Honorary Member, coupling with his name that of Professor M. K\u00fcnt\u00e9, who had lectured to them, sent Papers, and promised to send more.\n\nMr. G. Wall seconded, although, as he remarked, the proposal did not need a seconder, coming from the Chair. He wished at the same time to propose a vote of thanks to the Society's \"restorer,\" Col. Fyers, as the Colonel had certainly fulfilled that part. The Society was in a dormant state till Col. Fyers took that lively interest in it which had revived it to its present position. He (Mr. Wall) had been a witness of the Society's career, and was only sorry that he had done so little for it.\n\nMr. Smither endorsed the remarks made by Mr. Wall as to the President.\n\nThe Hon. President replied, ascribing the praise to the Honorary Secretary, who had written to many people as to Papers, and by his endeavours had resuscitated the Society.\n\nThe Meeting was then adjourned till some convenient day soon, when Papers will be read.\u2014[See Ceylon Observer, 6th April, 1881.]\n\n---\n\ngot, at least, a faint knowledge of attraction of gravitation from his observation. But that is no reason why it should be asserted that he did not know the thing.\n\nIt may be argued that the Hind\u00fas maintain, as Ptolemy did, that the sun goes round the earth, and that this is inconsistent with the laws of gravitation. It is therefore that I say that the Hindus did not know all the laws of gravitation in their entirety.\n\nAs it appears that the Europeans here did not all this time know the teachings of \"Siddh\u00e1nta Siromani,\" it is quite right for them to say that the laws of gravitation, or gravitation itself, was not known to the Hind\u00fas before Sir Isaac Newton's time.\n\nI would now amend the wording of my Essay thus:\u2014\"The laws of gravitation were known\" &c., should be \"Attraction of gravitation was known,\" &c.\n\nS. Mervin.\n\nColombo, 13th April, 1881.\nGENERAL MEETING.\n\nMay 7, 1881.\n\nPresent:\n\nThe Hon. W. H. Ravenscroft, Acting Colonial Secretary,\n(in the Chair),\n\nJ. Capper, Esq. | S.

Douglas, c.m.g.) had consented to join the Society as its Vice-Patron.\n\n3.\u2014The Honorary Secretary laid on the table a list of Books presented to and purchased for the Society's Library since the last Meeting (April 7th).\n\n4.\u2014The Honorary Secretary then read the following Papers:\n\n(i.) \"A Short Account of the principal Religious Ceremonies observed by the Kandyans of Ceylon,\" by C. J. R. Le Mesurier, Esq., c.c.s.\n\n(ii.) \"Valentyn's Account of Adam's Peak,\" by A. Spence Moss, Esq.\n(iii.) A Letter from J. G. Smither, Esq., combating Mr. S. Mervin's statement of the length of the Y\u00f3jana (Paper on \"Hind\u00fa Astronomy.\")*\n\n* The Hon. Sec., Royal Asiatic Society, C. B.\n\nDear Sir,\u2014In the interesting Paper on Hind\u00fa Astronomy read at the General Meeting on Thursday, Mr. Mervin informed us that a \"y\u00f3jana\" is considered equal to five English miles.\n\nReferring to the glossary given in Turnour's translation of the Mah\u00e1wapso (page 30), I find the following definition of the term which I transcribe verbatim:\n\n\"Y\u00f3jana\u2014passim: a measure of distance equal to four \"g\u00e1wutan,\" and each g\u00e1wutan, called gow in Sinhalese, is equal to four h\u00e6takmas, and an h\u00e6takma is considered equal to one English mile, which would make a y\u00f3jana to be 16 miles.\"\n\nThis I have endeavoured to make more clear by the following table, which I have prepared from the above:\n\n| English Miles | H\u00e6takmas | Gaws | Y\u00f3jana |\n|---------------|----------|------|--------|\n| 1             | 1        |      |        |\n| 4             | 4        | 1    |        |\n| 16            | 16       | 4    | 1      |\n\nAs the discrepancy between the two statements is so striking, I have thought it desirable to invite attention to it, and as Mr. Mervin tells us that he has adopted the \"y\u00f3jana\" as a standard measure for his calculations, I venture to suggest that he be requested to favour us at our next Meeting with precise information on this important point.\n\nI am, Dear Sir, Yours faithfully,\n\nJ. G. Smither.\n\nColombo, 9th April, 1881.\n\nThe Hon. Sec., Royal Asiatic Society, C. B.\n\nDear Sir,\u2014With reference to Mr. J. G. Smither's letter to you, dated the 9th April, 1881, and forwarded to me on the 20th ultimo, in which it is stated, that according to the definition given in \"Mah\u00e1wapso,\" one y\u00f3jana is equal to 16 English miles, instead of 5 miles as stated by me, I would in the first place quote the passage in my Essay referring to my estimate in English miles of a y\u00f3jana:\n\n\"I must say that the measurement of one y\u00f3jana is not exactly settled. According to a table given in this chapter (44th chap. Andak\u00f3sam of Skandapur\u00e1na) it is equal to 32,000 yards; according to some other authorities it is equal to 16,000 yards; and according to others, to 8,000 yards. A Chinese monk named 'Hieoun-Thsang,' who visited India in the middle of the 7th century, states that in India, according to ancient tradition, a y\u00f3jana equaled 40 li (a li is about 550 yards). According to the customary use of the Indian Kingdoms it is 30 li. But the y\u00f3jana mentioned in the Sacred Books contains only 16 li; which smallest y\u00f3jana is equal to 5 English miles.\"\n4.\u2014Votes of thanks to the writers of the above Papers (proposed by the Chairman), and to the Chairman (proposed by G. Wall, Esq., Vice-President, seconded by J. G. Smither, Esq.), unanimously carried, concluded the Meeting.\n\nIt is a matter of no infrequent occurrence that a term of distance, weight, or measurement, is variously estimated at different places; for instance:\n\nOne English foot is somewhat smaller than a Dutch foot.\nOne English pound (weight) is less than a Dutch pound.\nOne dollar (money) is considered by the Tamils to be \u00a30 1 6\nBy the Americans ... ... ... 0 4 2\nOne marakal (corn measure) is considered:\nBy the people of Southern India to contain ... 4 quarts.\nBy the people of the Wanni in Ceylon ... 10 do.\nBy people in Batticaloa District ... ... 8 do.\nOne K\u00e1tham or Gawatham (distance) is estimated:\nBy the Indian Tamils to be ... ... 10 miles.\nBy the Sinhalese of Ceylon ... ... 4 do.\n\nBefore the introduction of the Imperial Measure, great uncertainty existed with regard to weights and measures used in Great Britain; for it appears from the Preamble of the Act of 1824 that different weights and measures, some larger and some less, were in use in various places. Nor were the weights and measures in France, before the Revolution, free from confusion.\n\nJust in the same manner, one \"y\u00f3jana\" is estimated:\nBy the Indian Historians to be about ... 18 miles.\nBy the ancient Indian Government about ... 9\u00bd do.\nBy the writers of Indian Sacred Books or Sh\u00e1stram ... 5 do.\nBy the Sinhalese of Ceylon (see Mah\u00e1w\u00e1sso) ... 16 do.\n\nIt will be seen from the foregoing quotation that I myself have stated in the Essay, that the measurement of a \"y\u00f3jana\" is not exactly settled, but that it is mentioned in the Sacred Books or Sh\u00e1strams as equal to 5 English miles.\n\nFurther, \"y\u00f3jana\" being a term used by the Indians in their sciences, their estimates should be adopted in preference to that of other nations.\n\nAuthorities in favour of the Estimate of 5 Miles.\n\nI.\u2014Winslow's Tamil and English Dictionary, which is acknowledged to be the best of the kind:\n\n\"G\u00far\u00fa\u015b\u0101r\" (y\u00f3chanai).

The following table of\ndistances is given by him:\u2014\n\n24 \u0100\u1e47kulams (nearly an inch) make 1 Cubit.\n4 Cubits \" 1 Dhanu.\n2 Dhanus \" 1 Dan\u1e0dam.\n500 Dandams \" 1 K\u016bppidu.\n4 K\u016bppidus \" 1 Yojan\u00e1.\n\nMr. Carroll's Notes say that an \u0101\u1e47kulum is equal to 5-6th of an inch.\n\nAccording to this table a yojana is equal to 384,000 \u0101\u1e47kulams, or 320,000\ninches. An English mile being 1,760 yards, or 63,360 inches.\n\n\\[ \\frac{320,000}{63,360} = 5.05 \\text{ English miles, a yojana.} \\]\n\nV.\u2014The distances in yojanas as given in ancient works on Science, such\nas \"S\u016briyasiddh\u0101ntam,\" in regard to the diameter of the Earth, to the\ndiameter of the Moon's disc, to the atmosphere surrounding the Earth, &c.,\nbeing multiplied by 5, nearly correspond with the distances in miles as\ngiven in the European works on Astronomy. This fact is an indirect proof\nthat a yojana as used in Hind\u00fa sciences is apparently 5 English miles.\n\nI think that the above authorities support my statement, that a yojana\n(as used in Hind\u00fa Astronomy) is approximately 5 English miles, and that the\nterm is used in different places as expressing longer or shorter distances.\n\nI beg to remain, Dear Sir,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJaffna, 2nd December, 1881.\n\nS. MERVIN.\n\nThe Hon. Sec., Royal Asiatic Society, C. B.\n\nDear Sir,\u2014I return Mr. Mervin's letter of the 2nd instant, which you\nhave been so good as to forward for my perusal with yours of yesterday.\n\nMr. Mervin, in replying to my communication of the 9th of April last,\nhas furnished much valuable information on the subject of the \"yojana.\"\nThe several lengths given in his letter are however so widely different one\nfrom another (varying as they do from 18 miles to 5 miles) that it seems\nmore than ever necessary to accept with due caution astronomical calcula-\ntions based on such an uncertain measure of length as the \"yojana.\"\nappears to be. Even the authorities quoted by Mr. Mervin in support of his statement do not quite agree on the subject.\n\nOwing to the great length of Mr. Mervin's essay, the reading of it at the Meeting had to be considerably abridged. Amongst the passages left unread was that to which he refers in his letter, and his statement that a \"y\u00f3jana\" is equal to 5 English miles was made verbally in reply to a question asked by one of the Members present.\n\nMr. Mervin will understand that my sole object in drawing attention to this matter was to elicit information on a doubtful point, and certainly the best thanks of the Society are due to that gentleman for taking so much pains to supply it.\n\nI am, Dear Sir, Yours faithfully,\n\nColombo, 13th December, 1881.\n\nJ. G. SMITHER.\n\nFrom the following additional authorities it would appear, on the whole, safer to put the y\u00f3jana at from 7 to 8 miles.\n\n\"Bopp ('Nalus,' p. 213) says it is equal to 8 English miles ........\n\nBy following Fa Hian's route between places of which the identity is beyond question, as between Muttra and Canouje, and between Patna and Benares, we find the y\u00f3jan in his time to be as nearly as possible 7 English miles; and this agrees much better with what we find the y\u00f3jan to be, if we resolve it into its component parts:\n\n\\[ \\begin{align*}\n8 \\text{ barley corns} &= 1 \\text{ finger [angula]} \\\\\n24 \\text{ fingers} &= 1 \\text{ dund} \\\\\n1,000 \\text{ dund} &= 1 \\text{ krosa} \\\\\n4 \\text{ krosa} &= 1 \\text{ y\u00f3jan}.\n\\end{align*} \\]\n\nThis makes the y\u00f3jan equal to 6 miles, 106 yards, and 2 feet\"\u2014(Princep's Indian Antiquities, Vol. ii., p. 130).\n\n\"The y\u00f3jana, according to Mogall\u00e1na's scale (Abhid\u00e1nappadipik\u00e1), would be equal to between 12 and 12\u00bd miles, and this is the length given by Childers, (Pali Dict.), but I think it is certain that no such scale as Mogall\u00e1na gives was ever practically used in Ceylon. The finger joint (angula), span (vidath\u00ed), and cubit (ratana) may have been used for short lengths; the usabha for longer ones; the g\u00e1vuta and y\u00f3jana for paths or roads; but I doubt whether any attempt was made in practice to bring these different measures into one scheme.\"\u2014(Rhys Davids, in Numismata Orientalia, p. 15, 1877.)\n\nMr. Rhys Davids then proceeds to give a tabulated statement of 30 passages on the length of the y\u00f3jana, disclosing an average of about eight miles to the y\u00f3jana, and sums up:\u2014\"We have no data as yet for determining the sense in which the word y\u00f3jana is used in the Three Pitakas; in the 5th century Pali Literature it means between 7 and 8 miles\" (p. 17). See too Alwis' 'Attanagaluvansa,' p.p. 7, 8. \"Great misapprehension prevails as to the precise measure of a y\u00f3jana, which, I believe, could not have been more than 7 or 8 English miles.\"\u2014H.

Secretary, and it was decided to hold a special Meeting to hear these Papers read. This Meeting was held at the Colombo Museum this afternoon.\n\nThe Books lately received from Messrs Tr\u00fcbner & Co., were on view in the room.\n\nThe first Paper was one written by Mr. C. J. R. Le Mesurier, c.c.s., of Kandy, and read by the Hon. Secretary.\n\nThe Hon. Secretary then read a letter from Mr. J. G. Smither, criticising Mr. S. Mervin\u2019s calculation of the y\u00f3jana in his Paper on Hind\u00fa Astronomy; after which he read Mr. A. Spence Moss\u2019s Paper on \u201cValentyn\u2019s account of Adam\u2019s Peak.\u201d In the introductory letter to the Paper Mr. Moss wrote:\n\n\u201cWith regard to the caves said to exist on Adam\u2019s Peak, I saw during my ascent in February last, some cave-like sheltering places, under huge masses of rock, which have been, and are, used by pilgrims to pass the night under, to cook under in wet weather, &c., but all traces of rock-hewn figures, or built up fa\u00e7ade, have disappeared.\n\n\u201cI have waded through a good deal of Valentyn; he seems to have believed almost anything he was told, and to have confined himself to very superficial observation.\u201d\n\nAfter some interesting notices of, and extracts from, Valentyn\u2019s writings, Mr. Moss remarks:\n\n\u201cIt would be extremely interesting to know whether these caves really exist either on Adam\u2019s Peak itself or in some of the hills of the Peak range. Perhaps, if some of the gentlemen connected with the Revenue Service, of whom several are Members of this Society, were to enquire from priests and headmen, some tradition would be discovered which would lead to their identification. The author has been informed by the old priest of Aluwih\u00e1r\u00e9, that there are rock-cut shrines at the base or half-way up Adam\u2019s Peak, that the approaches are now overgrown with jungle, and that no one dare make the ascent: that they lie on the west side. Possibly the priest has framed his answer in accordance with what he saw was the anxiously-expected answer, regardless of strict truth.\u201d\n\nVotes of thanks to the writers of Papers, and to the Chairman, concluded the Meeting. It is probable that another Meeting will be held in a month.\u2014[See Ceylon Observer May, 7.]\nCommittee Meeting.\n\nJune 14, 1881.\n\nPresent:\n\nJ. G. Smither, Esq., in the Chair.\n\nRev. E. F. Miller, M.A. | W. Ferguson, Esq.\n\nH. C. P. Bell, Esq., Honorary Secretary.\n\n1.\u2014Confirmed Minutes of last Meeting.\n\n2.\u2014The Honorary Secretary announced that there was a considerable balance to the credit of the Society\u2014about \u00a3140, he believed, on the assurance of the Honorary Treasurer\u2014and suggested that a Sub-Committee be formed to select additional new Works for the C. A. S. Library.\n\nThe following gentlemen were\u2014subject to their consent\u2014to be asked to act on a Book Committee:\n\nC. Bruce, Esq., C.M.G., W. Ferguson, Esq., Rev. E. F. Miller, M.A., J. G. Smither, Esq., and the Honorary Secretary.\u2014Carried.\n\n3.\u2014Decided to invite C. Bruce, Esq., C.M.G., and J. G. Wardrop, Esq., to serve on the Committee of the Society, in place of J. B. Cull, Esq., and H. J. Macvicar, Esq., who have left the Island.\n\n4.\u2014The Honorary Secretary announced that Papers had been circulated among the Reading Committee, and that at a Meeting it had been decided:\n\n(a) That Messrs. Kunt\u00e9 and Nevill be asked to favour the Society with r\u00e9sum\u00e9s of their Papers to be read at a General Meeting, on the understanding that the Papers will be published in the C. A. S. Journal in extenso.\n\n(b) That Mr. L. Nell\u2019s Paper on \u201cThe Singhalese Kalawa\u201d be read at the next General Meeting.\n\n5.\u2014The Honorary Secretary announced that His Excellency the Lieutenant-Governor had consented to preside at the next General Meeting, any day between the 28th instant and the 10th July. Decided to call a General Meeting for July 6th at 3:30 p.m.\n\n6.\u2014The Honorary Secretary stated that a new Number of the Journal (Vol. VII., pt. ii., No. 23, 1881), was in the Press and would shortly be issued. He further stated that he had been unable at present to carry out the wishes of the Committee for a new Catalogue, owing to some misunderstanding on the part of the Museum Librarian regarding the MS. Catalogue, which he trusted would soon be set right.\nGENERAL MEETING.\n\nJuly 6, 1881.\n\nPresent:\n\nHis Excellency the Lieut.-Governor, Hon. J. Douglas, C.M.G.,\nVice-Patron, in the Chair.\n\nC.

Secretary:\n   i.\u2014On the Sinhalese Kal\u00e2wa,* by L. Nell, Esq.\n\n* Extract from Letter to the Hon. Secretary by Dandeis De Silva Gunaratna, Mudaliy\u00e2r.\n\n\"Mr. Nell has embodied in his Paper all that is known, or said, about the subject among the natives. The popular idea which they have of kal\u00e2wa (\u0915\u0932\u093e\u0935) is the principle of life perpetually traversing the body in the manner described, and having some mysterious connection with the Moon. It is something like the Sun which, without being stationary at any particular point, diffuses light and heat throughout the surrounding universe. Though every part of the animal body is endued with life, yet the centre, or nucleus, of that life is located at some point or other in the body, not stationary but in ceaseless motion; and that is kal\u00e2wa. It is hard to say what is the difference between Amrita-kal\u00e2wa and Visa-kal\u00e2wa except in the simple meanings of the two words. I am, however, inclined to think that there are two principles acting together but in opposite directions, the one controlling the other, in the manner in which the Life-principle acts; Amrita-kal\u00e2wa tending to invigorate and renew the system, while Visa-kal\u00e2wa tends to keep in check the too accelerated action of the system due to the immediate presence of the former. Any injury to the body must be felt more painfully, and when the pain is excessive must cause death, when the part so injured or affected is endued with greater sensibility. Wherever the life-principle resides, there the sensibility must be the greatest. Hence it is, I think, that people are cautioned against hurting that point in the body where the kal\u00e2wa is found on any particular day.\"\nii.\u2014A H\u00faniyam Image, by L.

Wall, Esq., Vice-President, announcing his immediate departure from the Island. The Secretary pointed out that the Society would thus be left without its President (Col. A. B. Fyers, R.E.) or either of its Vice-Presidents, (W. R. Kynsey, Esq., P.C.M.O., and G. Wall, Esq.)\n\nProposed by J. G. Smither, Esq., seconded by J. G. Wardrop, Esq., that the Hon. W. H. Ravenscroft, and C. Bruce, Esq., C.M.G., be invited to become additional Vice-Presidents of the Society.\u2014Carried unanimously.\n\n4.\u2014The Honorary Secretary stated that a new Catalogue was in the Press, but that some time must elapse before it could be issued, owing to the little leisure he was able to devote to the revision of proofs.\n\n5.\u2014The Honorary Secretary suggested that the Society might from the commencement of next year (1882) issue\u2014say twice a year, a Supplement to its Journal, consisting of extracts from Works now scarce, or out of print, (e.g., Ceylon Almanacs, 1833-35; Colombo Journal, 1832-3) relating to Ceylon.\n\nDecided to obtain from the local presses estimates of the cost per page of printing such a Supplement\u2014the question to stand over meanwhile.\nGeneral Meeting.\n\nOctober 6, 1881.\n\nPresent:\n\nThe Hon.

L. Vanderstraaten, Esq., M.D.\n\nThe process of rearing Silkworms was illustrated in detail.\n\nMr. James then addressed the Meeting at some length, recounting his efforts (hitherto abortive) to introduce the Bombyx, commonly found in the Cinnamon Gardens round Colombo, to the notice of silk-weavers in Europe, and exhibited some of the cocoons of this species of moth. Some general conversation on the subject followed.\n\nii.\u2014In the absence of the authors the Honorary Secretary read extracts from:\n\n(a.)\u2014A Paper \"On the 'Mirakanduri' Festival of the Muhammadans as observed in Colombo,\" by A. T. Shams-ud-Din.\n\n(b.)\u2014From Mudaliy\u00e1r S. Jayatillaka's Paper \"On Sinhalese Omens.\"\n\n5.\u2014A vote of thanks to the Chairman closed the Proceedings.\nAfter the Minutes of the last Meeting had been read and confirmed Dr. J. L. Vanderstraaten was called upon to read his Paper on \"Sericulture in Ceylon.\" The leafned Doctor said that he would not read his Paper in toto, but would just refer to the way in which the cultivation of silk had been introduced into Ceylon, and describe the specimens of eggs, worms, moths, &c., which he had brought with him. He informed the Meeting that in the time of the Portuguese and Dutch there had been a garden of mulberries and buildings for the rearing of silkworms on the bank of the Kelani, called Orta Seda, which is the Portuguese for 'silk garden,' but when the British took possession they found the industry abandoned. His Excellency the Governor, Sir James Longden, has introduced eggs from Japan, and it is hoped the culture will prove successful and remunerative. Father Palla, of the Roman Catholic Mission, now at Galle, who has the good of the people much at heart, is devoting much time and care to the pursuit, and has succeeded so well that he hopes Ceylon will in time rival Japan in the export of eggs to England. It seems that in Japan the moths are made to lay their eggs (which they do most systematically) on sheets of card-board, stamped with the Japanese mark: the moths resulting from one card are expected to fill 100 more cards with eggs;\u2014or, in other words, one card, weighing 1 oz. and costing Rs. 10, yields Rs. 1,000 worth of eggs. If mulberries are plentiful two such supplies can be obtained in a year. Father Palla expects to obtain like results or even better, for he has succeeded, he believed, in rearing two batches in the year against the single crop of Japan. The eggs received by him from Japan began to hatch soon after their arrival in December; they formed cocoons in a month, and the moths which came out of these cocoons laid eggs on a card (which was exhibited). These eggs are now hatching, and the larve, cocoons, moths, &c., shown at the Meeting were from these eggs.\n\nMr. James said that at the request of several of his correspondents he had repeatedly endeavoured to introduce the cinnamon-garden Bombyx into Europe, but from various causes his efforts hitherto had not met with success. The moths in some instances had all come out during transit, some with only one wing, some with none at all, and all \"shouting for elbow room.\" Then the Post Office refused to take live stock, as it introduced vermin to the destruction of letters. He had always sent chrysalides, as he had been specially requested not to send eggs: he did not know why. He had asked Mr. De Soyza to get his cinnamon-peelers to collect the caterpillars, promising so much a caterpillar, but the latter said they could not (? would not) find any. He himself had once found 150 all together, not on the cinnamon, but on a large tree whose name he did not know: that was the biggest haul he had ever made. He might say that this insect was already acclimatized to England, for it fed freely on the leaves of apple, pear, and other English fruit trees. The difficulty was to get the moths or eggs safely transmitted.\n\nAfter Dr. Vanderstraaten had answered the many various questions put to him, and Mr. W. Ferguson had stated that the mulberry grew freely enough in Ceylon,\n\nMr. Bell (Hon. Sec.) read extracts from a Paper \"On the Muhammedan Festival 'Mira Kanduri,'\" by A. T. Shams-ud-din. The most interesting part was a reference to the manner in which the Maldivians were converted\nto Isl\u00e1m. Mr. Bell referred to the description of the conversion given by the Arab traveller Ibn Bat\u00fata, and stated that he had just come across a Tamil book containing another account of the miracles performed at the time, which smacked of the Arabian Nights. This he had translated and would, with the permission of the Meeting, read. It was just the tale of the fisherman, the brass bottle, and the \"Ifrit,\" over again, only in this instance the bottle containing the imprisoned Jinn is dropped into the sea off Point-de-Galle.\n\nMr. Bell next read extracts from S. Jayatilaka Mudaliy\u00e1r's Paper \"On Sihhalese Omens.\" By general consent those connected with crows, lizards, and dogs were selected, and the various omens created great amusement. A dog getting on to the roof of a house was given as the worst of omens, many new houses having been abandoned and allowed to go to ruin from this cause.\n\nThe election of several new Members (including four Doctors) shows that the Society is rapidly gaining new life and vigour.\n\nMr. W. Ferguson added to the interest of the Meeting by exhibiting a true chameleon which he had captured in the Cinnamon Gardens, and which he believed to be an escape, as none had ever been found in this part of Ceylon before.

Bruce, C.M.G., proposed, and Mr. W. Ferguson seconded, the election of the following candidates as new Members:\n\nHon. J. Stoddart, and Messrs. C. E. Dunlop, C.C.S., L. J. E. G. Tate, C.C.S., and Adrian Hope.\n\nNo objection being taken to the proposed candidates, they were declared duly elected Members of the Society.\n3.\u2014The Honorary Secretary laid on the table the books presented to, and purchased by, the Society since the last General Meeting.\n\n4.\u2014The Meeting proceeded to consider the amendments in the Rules, approved by the Committee:\n\n(a) In Rule 3; after clause (b) to add the following:\u2014\"Persons desirous of rejoining the Society may be re-admitted Members without entrance fee, subject to the discretion of the Managing Committee.\"\u2014Agreed to.\n\n(b) In Rule 4; to substitute for the words \"all appointed from time to time by open vote at some General Meeting,\" the words \"all appointed by open vote at the Annual Meeting.\"\u2014Agreed to.\n\n(c) It was proposed to follow up the previous amendment by the following clause:\u2014\"By departure from the Island any Office-bearer shall be held to have vacated his office.\"\n\nThis provoked considerable discussion.\n\nThe Hon. P. R\u00e1ma-Nath\u00e1n suggested that, in place of the above clause, the Rule with reference to the Legislative and Municipal Councils should be adopted; viz., if any officer absents himself from the Colony, and continues to be absent for three months, he shall, ipso facto, vacate his office.\n\nMr. Berwick thought it would be rather hard that any officer, who should absent himself for three months, say by taking a holiday trip\u2014for instance to the Nilgherries\u2014should thereby vacate his office. It seemed to him that the proposed rule would work very prejudicially to the interests of the Society. Ultimately the following amendment, proposed by Mr. Berwick and seconded by Mr. L. F. Lee, was adopted:\n\n\"In the event of any Office-bearer leaving the Colony for three (3) months, it shall be competent for the Committee to fill up the office at the next General Meeting.\"\n\n(d) To substitute in Rule 7, for the words \"in the first week of November,\" the words \"in December.\"\u2014Agreed to.\n\n(e) Subject to the consent of Museum Committee, to adopt the Rules for the C. A. S. Library, drawn up by the Honorary Secretary, in place of the Resolutions of the Museum Committee at present appended to the Rules of the Society.\n\nThis, after considerable discussion, was withdrawn in favour of the following amendment:\n\n\"That the Committee of the C. A. S. in conjunction with the Museum Committee, do consider the new Rules for the C. A. S.\nLibrary drawn up by the Honorary Secretary, with a view to their adoption.\"\n\n5.\u2014Mr. J. F. Churchill proposed and Dr. Loos seconded, that the following Office-bearers, nominated by the Committee, be elected for the ensuing year:\n\nPresident.\u2014C. Bruce, Esq., C.M.G.\n\nVice-Presidents.\u2014The Hon. R. Cayley, Chief Justice, and the Hon. W. H. Ravenscroft, C.C.S.\n\nHon. Treasurer.\u2014J. G. Wardrop, Esq.\n\nHon. Secretary.\u2014H. C. P. Bell, Esq., C.C.S.\n\nCommittee.\u2014Messrs. T. Berwick, J. Capper, A. C. Dixon, Major A. Ewing, W. Ferguson, L. F. Lee, Rev. E. F. Miller, A. Murray, Hon. P. Rama-Nath\u00e1n, J. G. Smither, and J. L. Vanderstraaten, M.D.\n\n\u2014Carried.\n\nThe Secretary then read the\n\nANNUAL REPORT.\n\n\"Your Committee wish to revive the salutary practice, which has been in abeyance for a decade, of submitting to the Society annually a brief Report, giving a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the year's work, and intended to supplement the usual Address of the President.\n\n\"As in 1871, when the last Report was issued, so now your Committee is able to congratulate the Society on \"the new era which has dawned upon it.\" It is highly satisfactory to believe that the efforts made to resuscitate the \"dry bones\" from the apparently hopeless sleep of at least five years (1874-1879) have met with success, and that the Ceylon Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society is once more in a fair way to re-assume the creditable position it formerly held among earned sister Societies.\n\n\"That a Society of this nature should have to pass through vicissitudes of fortune, is but to be expected, and the life history of the Ceylon Asiatic Society, as our past records disclose, has been marked by such alternations. The causes are easily traceable:\u2014frequent changes of Secretaries\u2014departure from Colombo, or the Island, of Members able and willing to help forward the Society's interests\u2014the irregular issue of Journals\u2014and, perhaps above all, the long intervals which have been allowed to lapse between Meetings. It is, therefore, the more encouraging to note that Phoenix-like, the Society has ever risen from its ashes and developed renewed vigour for another lease of life.\n\n\"Members.\u2014The Society has received during the year an accession to its numbers of 30 ordinary Members, of whom nine have rejoined. Two Members have left Ceylon and relinquished their connection\nwith the Society. In May the Lieutenant-Governor, the Hon. J. Douglas, C.M.G., consented to join the Society and become its Vice-Patron. There are now on the list 11 Life Members, 4 Honorary Members, and 94 ordinary Members, or 109 in all. These figures cannot but be satisfactory as showing that the Society is steadily regaining the attention of intelligent members of the community interested in the objects which it sets before it. Cordial relations have been re-established with many corresponding Societies, and the awakening once more to active life of the Ceylon Asiatic Society is welcomed on all sides.\n\n\"Meetings.\u2014During the year four General Meetings have been held, your Committee has met four times, and the Book and Reading Committee as occasion required.\n\n\"Papers.\u2014There has been no lack of Papers sent in to the Hon. Secretary, and it is believed that these will not suffer by comparison with those of past years generally. The coming year promises to witness the publication of further valuable and interesting Papers of equal, if not higher merit.\n\n\"Journals.\u2014In the 10 years between 1871 and 1880 inclusive, the Society issued only seven Numbers of its Journal (1870-71, 1871-72 with Proceedings, 1873 pt. i., 1874 pt. i., 1879, 1880, 2 pts.), and, in separate pamphlet form, Proceedings 1870-71 and 1873-74.\n\n\"At the outset of the present year matters stood as follow:\u2014\n\n(a) Proceedings of the Society had not been published for five years.\n\n(b) Journals had been issued so irregularly that not only had many fallen out of print, but the Library of the Society itself was without a single copy of several Numbers, nor was it known how many Journals had been published since the institution of the Society.\n\n\"Steps were at once taken by your Committee to remedy these defects. Government liberally acceded to a request for permission to have the back Numbers of the Society's Journals, the stock of which had become exhausted, reprinted at the Government Press, and a private member (Mr. D. W. Ferguson) generously lent his copies\u2014the only complete set available\u2014for the purpose. The Numbers out of print are, 1848-49, 1849-50, 1853 No. 1, 1856-58 2 pts., 1858-59, 1860-61, 1870-71. Pressure of other business prevented the work of reprinting progressing as fast as had been anticipated, and it is a question whether it may not be desirable to entrust a portion of the Journals to be reprinted to some local press. The Journal for 1853, No. 1, (now classed as No. 6, 1853) is, however, on the eve of completion, and another Number is well advanced.\n\"To put an end to the confusion as to past Journals, your Committee desired the Honorary Secretary to draw up an authoritative division into Volumes, numbering them consecutively. A \"Summary of the Ceylon Asiatic Society's Journals, 1845-1880,\" giving the headings of the several Papers, was accordingly issued, by which the 22 Numbers were divided into six Volumes. It is hoped this summary of contents may be of use (provisionally at least), and your Committee is glad to announce that a Member of the Society (Major A. Ewing) has consented to undertake the preparation of an Index to Volumes I to VI.\n\n\"The 'Summary' was preceded by 'Proceedings, 1875-80,' and has been followed by Journal, Vol. VII., pt. i., No. 23, 1881. A new Number is in the Press.\n\n\"Library.\u2014At the commencement of the year it was brought to the notice of the Committee that the state of the Books, &c., in the Society's Library was such as to call for immediate action. It was found that from neglect, and carelessness, not only had a large proportion of the Books, &c., remained unbound for many years, or been bound up irregularly, but very many had become so dilapidated as to necessitate their being rebound without delay, and that there were large gaps in series of the Transactions of various Societies, and in other Periodicals, one or two volumes missing from many sets\u2014besides several valuable works, which it is well known were formerly in the Library and have unaccountably disappeared. Efforts have been made during the year to fill these gaps, as far as possible, and, thanks to the generosity of other Societies, back Numbers of their Transactions have been received to fill the places of those missing. Of course the Society has been put to considerable expense by having to repurchase important works, which it once possessed, at an enhanced price. Thus, to give but one instance\u2014in 1867, Princep's invaluable \"History of Indian Antiquities,\" edited by Thomas, was purchased for \u00a31 5s. It disappeared, and the Society had this year to replace it at a cost of \u00a38 8s.!\n\n\"Some excuse for this discreditable state of things may be found in the fact of the necessary confusion occurring at the time of the transfer to the Museum building, to the want of a paid Librarian, and the absence of a Catalogue of the Library. The last Catalogue (on the alphabetical system) was issued in 1870, and has long been out of print. After the transfer of the books to the Museum the Library became virtually useless to all except a few readers, whose time fortunately allowed them to attend the Museum. By Resolutions of the Museum Committee, the rule by which the books could not be taken out of the Museum was relaxed as regards the Society's Library. The want of a new Catalogue was, however, keenly felt, and your Committee learns with satisfaction that one is now in the\nPress, and will be put into the hands of Members as soon as the Honorary Secretary can single-handed revise the proofs.\n\n\"At their last Meeting, the Committee resolved to ask Government to allow the present Attendant at the Museum to be employed as paid Librarian of the Society upon an increase to his salary of \u00a36 a year payable by the Society. This boon Government has granted. New Rules for the Library (adopted almost verbatim from those of the R. A. S. Bengal, June, 1878) have been submitted to the Museum Committee, and it is expected will obtain their sanction.\n\n\"Regarding additions to the Library made during the year, the Committee need do no more than refer to the lists which follow the Proceedings of each General Meeting in proof of the substantial gain thus acquired by the Society. Many valuable presentations have been made, and a sum of over \u00a3100 spent on the purchase of works. The improvement in the appearance of the Books on the shelves will be apparent, and that the sum expended on book-binding has been properly employed. Some 200 Volumes in all have been bound, or rebound, during the year. With the new Catalogue and explicit Rules in the hands of Members, the Library cannot fail to be more generally used than has been the case hitherto.\n\n\"Money.\u2014The Balance sheet of the year's expenditure is appended. As was to be expected, the disbursements have been exceptionally heavy, but the Society's annual revenue, coupled with the large amount to its credit at the close of last year, has enabled the Committee to spend freely wherever the interests of the Society seemed to require. In spite of all there is remaining a balance to the credit of the Society of Rs. 614\u00b789.\n\n\"The Committee cannot close their report without a special expression of their regret that Mr. A. Murray finds that his other duties will not allow him to continue as Honorary Treasurer. When Mr. Murray first assumed duties in 1877, the Society was in a state of chaos, and it is greatly due to his energy and zeal that a collapse was then prevented. The subscriptions had not been called in for some years, and the accounts of the Society were apparently in hopeless confusion. Mr. Murray grappled with the difficulty so effectually as to be able to continue to show a clean balance-sheet yearly.\"\n\nC. Bruce Esq., c.m.e., moved, and the Honorary Secretary seconded, the adoption of the Report.\u2014Carried nem. com.\n\nMajor Ewing then moved, and W. Ferguson, Esq., seconded, a cordial vote of thanks to the retiring Honorary Treasurer, Mr. Murray.\u2014Carried unanimously.\n\nC. Bruce, Esq., c.m.g., having returned thanks for the honor done him, in electing him President of this Society for the ensuing year, proceeded to read his Address:\u2014\nPresident's Address.\n\nThe Rules of our Society set forth that its design is to institute and promote enquiries into the History, Religion, Literature, Arts and Social Condition of the present and former inhabitants of the Island, with its Geology and Mineralogy, its Climate and Meteorology, its Botany and Zoology. It will be convenient for me to adhere to this order in a brief survey of the work accomplished, or undertaken, during the year, either by Members of our Society or by others interested in our design.\n\nHistory.\n\nSince our last Meeting, Dr. E. M\u00fcller's Archaeological labours in Ceylon have come to an end. Translations of eleven ancient inscriptions from the Anur\u00e1dhapura and Hambantota districts, now in the Museum, have recently been published as a Sessional Paper, and the Society now looks forward with interest to his final Report on the collective results of the archaeological work done by Dr. Goldschmidt and himself. When Dr. M\u00fcller left the colony, three months' leave was given to him for the preparation of this Report, which we may therefore shortly expect.\n\nOriental scholars interested in Ceylon will regret to hear that Mah\u00e1-Mudaliy\u00e1r de Zoysa's translation of the Mah\u00e1wa\u014bso has been for some time delayed by his failing health and loss of sight, and is now temporarily suspended, in order that he may complete the Catalogue of Sanskrit MSS. in the Temple Libraries, on which he has been long engaged. In the course of his official visits to the Temple Libraries, the Mah\u00e1-Mudaliy\u00e1r has had many opportunities of collecting information about the V\u0113dd\u00e1s, and the results of these incidental studies he is now preparing to contribute to our Journal. On the question of the origin of the V\u0113dd\u00e1s, he has called attention to an important passage in the Mah\u00e1wa\u014bso, the meaning of which he believes to be misinterpreted in Turnour's translation. The Mah\u00e1wa\u014bso narrates the adventures and marriage of Vijayo\u2014who in B.C. 543 landed near the mouth of the Mi-oya, on the site of the present Puttalam, and founded the historical dynasty of Ceylon\u2014with an aboriginal princess named Kuv\u00e9ni, by whom he had a son named Jivahatto and a daughter named Dis\u00e1la. Kuv\u00e9ni and her children, having been banished by Vijayo on his determining to marry a daughter of the South Indian King Pandavo of Madura, took refuge in the country near the Samantak\u00fa\u1e6da mountain (Adam's Peak) where Jivahatto married his sister and had a numerous family, of whom, if the interpretation given to the passage by the Mah\u00e1-Mudaliy\u00e1r is correct, the V\u0113dd\u00e1s are the descendants. In the course of his official duties, the Mah\u00e1-Mudaliy\u00e1r has ascertained the existence of a tradition, apparently independent of the Mah\u00e1wa\u014bso, that the V\u0113dd\u00e1s were originally settled in the Sabara-\ngamuwa district. To his note contributed to our Journal on this subject he has added a few specimens of Vedd\u00e1 songs and charms, and he has nearly ready for publication a Vocabulary of the Vedd\u00e1 language. It is desirable that the primitive elements of the language of this singular people should be established without delay. It is stated that they now communicate more freely with their neighbours, and, if this is the case, their original vocabulary is likely soon to be much disguised by the introduction of foreign words and forms. Another member of our Society, Mr. C. J. R. Le Mesurier, c.c.s., has also been collecting notes on the subject of the Vedd\u00e1s, which he hopes to complete during a projected shooting-excursion in the Vedd\u00e1 country.\n\nTwo Vedd\u00e1 skulls were sent last year to Professor Virchow, of Berlin, to be examined by that eminent anthropologist. They have recently been returned to the Museum, but we have not yet ascertained the results of Professor Virchow's examination.* Before making his report, he has asked for further information as to the number of Vedd\u00e1s still in existence, as to their colour, the shape of their features, and their size compared with Tamils and Sinhalese. He has also asked for a series of photographs illustrative of good types of the race. A few photographs have already been taken, and copies of them are in the Museum.\n\nMr. H. Nevill, c.c.s., has contributed to our Journal an erudite essay in identification of Kalah, the emporium in Ceylon, where the products of Eastern Asia were gathered for the markets of the West. Sir Emerson Tennent believed that the ancient centre of the kingdom of Kalah was the modern port of Galle, but Mr. Nevill has endeavoured to show that the emporium of Taprobane or Serendib, from B.C. 500 until a comparatively recent time, was not Galle, but the coast from Mann\u00e1r to the D\u00e9duru-oya. He believes that the emporium was not limited to one spot, but consisted of a cluster of petty ports, while the site of Tammann\u00e1 Nuwara was the capital of the ruler who governed under the Sultans of Zabedj. The identification of a commercial centre naturally suggests an enquiry into the circumstances and nationality of the people by whom it was maintained, and has led Mr. Nevill to an extensive study of the legendary and historical narratives connected with the early colonization of the Island. The results of these studies have brought him to the conclusion that the term N\u00e1gas signifies historically an aboriginal tribe of snake-worshippers whose descendants form, with an infusion of \u00c1ryan blood, the bulk of our Sinhalese population, while the term Yakkhos signifies historically the ancestors of the Tamils of the Jaffna Wanni, the Eastern Province, and the Puttalam district, who held the emporium\n\n* Professor Virchow's essay, Ueber die Weddas von Ceylon und ihre Beziehungen zu den Nachbars\u00e4mmen has since been received.\nof trade as a colony of the empire of Zabedj, in opposition to the N\u00e1gas, who held the rest of the Island. Mr. Nevill is now engaged on some essays on the religions and races of Southern India, which he hopes to put in circulation among literary Societies early next year.\n\nMr. Albert Gray has offered us, as a contribution to our knowledge of a later period of Ceylon history, a translation from the French of Defr\u00e9mery and Sanguinetti of so much of the Travels of Ibn Bat\u00fata (about A.D. 1344) as relates to Ceylon and the M\u00e1ldiv\u00e9 Islands. This we propose to publish in the first Number of our Journal for 1882, and in order to render it more valuable by the accurate identification of the places mentioned in the text we are sending proof-sheets of the Ceylon portion to Members of the Society, and others from whom we hope to receive assistance, with a request that their suggestions and views may be communicated to us.\n\nMr. Donald Ferguson is preparing for our Society a translation of an Essay, \"Origem do Reino dos Leces e do Nome de Ceylao,\" by J. de Vasconcellos Abreu.\n\nOur excellent Secretary is collecting information, letters, &c., touching the English and French captives in Kandy in the 17th century.\n\nBefore passing to another branch of the investigations of the Society, I would invite attention to the materials for historical research contained in the Government Record Office. Col. Fyers pointed out last year that the Dutch Records must contain valuable information, bearing on the past history and administration not only of this Island but also of the various settlements and marts mostly established by the Dutch. It is worth the consideration of the Committee whether some portion of our funds might be annually devoted to the preparation of a summary of the Colonial Office Records as suggested by Col. Fyers. There is the more reason to think seriously of this proposal, as before long many of the older Dutch Records are likely to succumb to age, climate, or insects.\n\nReligions.\n\nThe Asiatic and Oriental Societies of Europe and their branches in the East are not in the accepted sense of the term \"Religious Societies,\" but a very large share of their enterprise has always been devoted to the investigation of the religion of the East. In these investigations Christian Missionaries have taken an important part, and the earlier Journals of our Society owe much of their value to the contributions of the Rev. D. J. Gogerly, the Rev. Spence Hardy, and others. In the new revival of our Society we shall be glad to receive the assistance of their successors and disciples. In estimating the extent and depth of Mission work in the East, even those who are least inclined to look with partiality on Mission\nagencies must in candour admit that, while the Missionaries of various denominations are labouring to translate the Christian scriptures into all the languages of the world, in order to bring the doctrines of the Christian faith within the comprehension of peoples of every tongue, they avail themselves also of the linguistic abilities thus acquired in doing for the adherents of other religious systems what they have been slow to do for themselves. By means of translating, and still more by critical editions of the original text of the ancient Books which claim to be the inspired repositories of their several creeds, Christian scholars have now made it possible for the adherents of the four chief antagonistic systems prevalent in the world\u2014Christianity, Br\u00e1hmanism, Buddhism, and Isl\u00e1m\u2014to study each other's dogmas; and indeed their own, in the books held sacred by each (Modern India, Monier William, p. 204.)\n\nIn view of the enthusiastic interest with which Buddhistic studies have lately been prosecuted in Europe, I may be allowed to draw attention to two valuable repositories of Buddhist works, not widely known in Ceylon, and probably unknown altogether to European scholars. I refer to the Vidy\u00f3daya College Library, and the Library of the priest Subh\u00fati Terunn\u00e1nse at Waskaduwa. The former Library was founded by the high priest Sumangala, Principal of the College, and opened about two years ago. It contains P\u00e1li, Sanskrit and English works. The P\u00e1li works are all in manuscript, and consist of the three Pit\u00e1kas and grammatical writings. They are all arranged and classified. Most of the Sanskrit works are in print. The Sighalese works include both MSS. and printed books. The English books are confined chiefly to works on Buddhism and the History of India. The Library is intended for public use without payment of any subscription. At present it is almost exclusively used by the students of the College. As a large collection is expected shortly to be added to the Library, it would be of advantage that the preparation of a catalogue should be commenced without delay. The Waskaduwa Library is the property of Subh\u00fati Terunn\u00e1nse. It contains a large collection of Buddhist doctrinal works in the P\u00e1li language in Burmese characters, together with a good selection of Sanskrit and Sighalese works. I may here add that the learned master of this Library has prepared a revised edition of the P\u00e1li dictionary\u2014Abhidh\u00e1nappad\u00edpik\u00e1\u2014which is now being printed at the cost of Government. He has been good enough to send me a Catalogue of the works in his Library, which will be of service for the P\u00e1li Text Society, which has been started on the model of the Early English Text Society in order to render accessible to students the hitherto unedited stores of early Buddhist Literature. The prospectus of the Society was published in the first part of our Journal for the present year, and a further statement of the position and intention of the Society will be appended to our next issue.\nMr. Donald Ferguson has in hand for our Society the text and a translation of \"Jinacarita,\" a life of Buddha in P\u0101li verse.\n\nA private Society of Buddhists has lately published, at the Satth\u0101l\u014dka Press in Colombo, the \"S\u0101sanavagga Dipa: a History of the Buddhist Church in P\u0101li verse, compiled from Buddhist scriptures, commentaries and histories, by A'ch\u0101riya Vimalas\u0101ra Thera, of the Ambagahapitiya Vih\u0101r\u0113.\" The author and publishers of this work state that, having published it \"with the view of promoting the interests of religion,\" they \"have decided not to sell it, but to present free copies to those whom they may consider deserving.\" I have no doubt that they will consent to supply copies to learned Societies and scholars interested in the subject with which it deals.\n\nThe Society will learn with pleasure that Professor M. M. K\u00fcnte, who in the year 1879 gave us an interesting lecture in this room on the Vedic and Buddhistic politics, as the two influences which formed the present Br\u0101hmanic policy of India, has forwarded to us a Paper on Nirv\u0101na, in its connection with the social and religious developments traced in his lecture. Professor K\u00fcnte's paper will be printed in our Journal next year, and I will not now anticipate its publication.\n\nA short account of the principal religious ceremonies observed by the Kandyans, by Mr. C. J. R. Le Mesurier, was read at our May meeting. In addition to public ceremonies and processional festivals, it gives an interesting account of ceremonies connected with private life and personal religion, including Pirit, a ceremony to ward off evil, performed on the occasion of some epidemic or a serious illness, which is very minutely described; Godana Mangalyaya ceremony, performed for the very aged or those who are about to die; Mataka Dana, the ceremony of conferring merit on the dead; and Awa Mangalyaya, the ceremony in which offerings are made by the friends of a deceased person to the priests \"in order that they may obtain merit in the name of the deceased.\"\n\nWe are printing a short paper by Mr. A. T. Shams-ud-d\u012bn on the M\u012bra Kand\u016bri festival of the Muhammadans, annually held at the Marad\u0101na mosque in honor of M\u012bra Saibu\u2014a patron saint of Musulm\u0101n ship captains and sailors. Mr. H. C. P. Bell has given a particular interest to this contribution by a note on the legend which attributes to the miraculous intervention of this saint in the M\u0101ldives, by destroying a Jinn, to which the sacrifice of a girl had to be annually made, the conversion of the M\u0101ldive people to Isl\u0101m.\n\nAt the International Congress of Orientalists, held in Berlin in September last, Professor Monier Williams read a paper on the place which the Rig-veda occupies in the Sandhy\u0101, or daily morning and evening prayers, of the Hind\u016bs. I allude to this subject here, because it would be interesting for European scholars to know how far the Rig-veda, which serves as a bond of religious communion between\nmillions of Indo-Aryans spread over the vast area of India, distinct from each other in separate caste and communities, and owning subjection to divers laws and customs, forms a constituent part of the religious ceremonial of Ceylon Hind\u00fas. In the hope that the enquiry may engage the attention of Members or others interested in the design of our Society, I subjoin an abstract of Prof. William's paper:\n\n\"The Hind\u00fa worshipper, before offering his first morning prayer, is required to bring body and mind into a proper condition of purity and attention. He must bathe, apply ashes to his limbs and forehead, bind up his hair, sip pure water thrice from some sacred stream, inhale pure air into his lungs and retain it for some time in his chest by suppressing his breath. These preliminary acts must be completed before the sun rises. Then, turning towards the eastern sky, he utters his first morning prayer in Sanskrit\u2014the celebrated Gayatiri prayer from Rig-veda iii., 62, 10\u2014which like the Lord's Prayer among Christians, and like the F\u00e1tihah or first chapter of the Kur\u00e1n among Muhammadans, must always among Hindus take precedence of all other forms of supplication. It may be thus translated:\u2014\n\n'Let me meditate on the excellent glory of the divine vivifying sun. May he enlighten my understanding.'\n\nThe worshipper next performs a kind of self-baptism by pouring water over his own head, at the same time reciting the hymn Rig-veda x., 9:\u2014'O, waters, give fine health; bestow upon me vigour and strength,' etc. After that comes the repetition of the Agha-marshana or 'guilt-extinguishing' hymn (Rig-veda, x., 190), supposed to have an all-powerful effect in removing sin and containing a summary of the course of creation:\u2014'From glowing heat sprang all existing things; yea, all the order of this universe, etc.' The worshipper then renders homage to the rising sun by throwing water towards that luminary three times, each time repeating the Gayatiri prayer (Rig-veda, iii., 62, 10: as before), after which he repeats a prayer to the eternal mother Aditi, from Rig-veda, v., 69, 3:\u2014'I invoke the divine Aditi at early dawn,' etc.\n\nThe worshipper now sits down on the ground, repeating at the same time a prayer to the Earth:\u2014'Goddess, support me, purify my seat on the bare ground.' This is followed by some remarkable gesticulations. To a spectator it appears as if the worshipper were crossing himself, but he is really touching various parts of his own body\u2014such as eyes, ears, and breast and head\u2014with his fingers, as an act of homage to those organs, supposed to be animated by the Divine presence. After this the sacred Gayatiri prayer ought to be again repeated, and this time muttered 108 times by help of a rosary of 108 beads.\"\n\n\"The worshipper now rises, and, standing erect with his face towards the sun, recites what is called the Mitra hymn to the sun (from Rig-veda, iii., 59):\u2014'Mitra calls men to activity, sustains the earth and sky, and beholds all creatures with unwinking eye,' etc.\"\nThis is followed by a prayer to the Dawn goddesses (from Rig-veda, iv. 51, 11, :\u2014\u2018Hail, brilliant Dawn: Daughters of Heaven,\u2019 etc. The service closes with adoration of the ten quarters of the sky and a recitation of the family pedigree. In the mid-day service, other hymns of the Rig-veda are substituted, such as i., 35, 2; iv., 40, 5, and that called Saura-suk a (Rig-veda, i., 50.) In the evening service the prayers to the sun on standing erect is Rig-veda, i., 25. All three services conclude with the following prayer:\u2014\u2018May the one supreme Lord of the Universe be pleased with this my devotion.\u2019\n\nIn connection with this subject, I must mention that the great Petersburg Lexicon of B\u00f6htlingk and Roth, the existence of which gives by itself a new character to all investigations of the Sanskrit language, and pre-eminently to the study of the Vedic texts, has recently been added to the Museum Library.\n\nInseparable from the subject of popular religion is the subject of popular superstition, which has formed the topic of three papers read during the year. Mr. Louis Nell, at one of our meetings, exhibited a H\u00faniyam charm, of which a photograph will be published in our Journal. These H\u00faniyam charms represent a Sighalese custom in accordance with the widely-extended superstitious device of inflicting disease or disaster on a person\u2019s enemies through the potency of a rude eidolon or representation of the intended victim. Mr. Nell\u2019s note in explanation of this charm derives particular interest from the statement of his belief, founded on long residence among the native Sighalese, and careful observation of their superstitious practices and expressions of superstitious ideas, that Buddhism, up to the time of a quite recent reform movement, has not existed at all as a religion among the lower castes of the Sighalese people, whose priests have been the Yakadur\u00e1s or Kott\u00e1diy\u00e1s, belonging to the tom-tom-beater and oliya castes; and Kapur\u00e1llas and Pattinis, belonging to all castes. The following passage in Mr. Nell\u2019s note seems to me to suggest considerations of general importance for a right apprehension of the real extent and influence of Buddhism, and of quite paramount importance as an element in determining the direction of mission enterprise:\n\n\u201cThe tom-tom beaters, the toddy-drawers, and the jaggery-makers have only lately attempted to build Buddhist temples of their own. The Amarapura sect of Buddhists is a modern importation to satisfy the social ambition of the Mahabadd\u00e9 people, candidates of whose community for priestly ordination would have been refused by the previously existing Siamese sect. The latter, though heterodox in this exclusiveness, had confined the rite of ordination to pupils drawn from the Goiyagama caste. The liberal and orthodox principle of the Amarapura sect extended in time from the Mahabadd\u00e9 and Kar\u00e1we to the lower castes, and, as an instance, the jaggery people\n(Hakuru) near Galle have built a temple, and their priests in yellow robes and with begging bowls in their hands are now seen obtaining the food of mendicants from the hands of their own friends. The profound meditative air of the young mendicants and the evident pride with which their friends give alms and honor the new priesthood are very striking. This is quite a reform, and Buddhism, perhaps, for the first time is subverting what other missions have not hitherto observed as a likely field of conversion.\"\n\nMr. Nell has also favored us with a paper on the Sinhalese observance of the Kal\u00e1wa, which he interprets to be \"a moving principle and local predisposition following a course in the human body in relation to the course of the moon in her increase and decrease.\" The fact that Kal\u00e1wa tables are published by the Lakrivikirana Press and in native vernacular almanacs indicates a belief of wide-spread recognition, but Mah\u00e1-Mudaliy\u00e1r De Zoysa found the explanations of two of the best Vedar\u00e1las inconsistent and contradictory. I suppose that Kal\u00e1wa may be interpreted generally as the influence of the phases of the moon on the organization or temperament of the human body.\n\nAn elaborate paper on \"Omens\" by Mudaliy\u00e1r S. Jayatilaka of Kurun\u00e9gala was read before the Society in October, showing how large an influence they exercise on the daily concerns of Sinhalese life. The omens derived from the appearance and cry of lizards in particular are dealt with in an exhaustive manner, account being taken of their position relative to the person interested, with reference to every day in the week.\n\nMah\u00e1-Mudaliy\u00e1r De Zoysa is preparing for publication a translation of a sermon of Buddha on Omens.\n\nThis is really a subject of practical importance. It has been asserted that the impossibility of understanding the motives of the people in India is partly due to the control exercised over them by superstitious influences. The remark, perhaps, applies with equal truth to the people of Ceylon.\n\nLiterature.\n\nIn the domain of Literature I desire, in the first place, to invite attention to the labours of Mr. William Gunatilaka who has been engaged for some time on three important works; the B\u00e1lvabodhana of K\u00e1syapa; a new edition of P\u00e1nini's Grammar; and a MS. of the Meghad\u00fata of K\u00e1lid\u00e1sa. The B\u00e1lvabodhana is a reproduction of the grammar of Chandra by a Buddhist priest named K\u00e1syapa who lived in Ceylon about seven centuries ago. Incidental allusions to Chandra show him to have been the founder of one of the principal schools of Sanskrit grammarians, but his grammar has been supposed hitherto to exist only in a Thibetan version. It was\nbased on the model and intended as an improvement on P\u00e1nini's *Asht\u00e1dhy\u00e1yi*, from which it appears to differ by the artificial *memoria technica*, which constitutes the language of Sanskrit grammarians, being in certain instances even more ingeniously and comprehensively constructed than the *s\u00fatras* of P\u00e1nini. Provision is thus made for grammatical combinations which it taxed the utmost subtlety of P\u00e1nini's commentators to include in the interpretation of his *s\u00fatras*. The MS. of the B\u00e1l\u00e1vabodhana,* first discovered by Mr. Gunatilaka, belongs to the Lank\u00e1tilaka Vih\u00e1r\u00e9 near Kandy. Two copies have since been found, one belonging to the Suduhumpola Vih\u00e1r\u00e9, and the other to the Oriental Library of the Vidy\u00f3daya College, already alluded to. These copies are all in S\u00edghalese characters, but Mr. Gunatilaka has transcribed the whole work in Devan\u00e1gari character, and the text collected from the three copies, together with a short preface and explanatory notes is now only withheld from the press by the heavy expenditure involved in its issue. Mr. Gunatilaka is no doubt justified in his opinion that the publication of this work would be of great service to Oriental schools in throwing new light upon questions relative to the historical connection of the different systems of Sanskrit Grammar and upon other problems now engaging attention.\n\nThe same difficulty interferes with the publication of a work, undertaken by Mr. Gunatilaka, of at least equal importance\u2014an edition of P\u00e1nini which will enable students acquainted with the language of Sanskrit general literature to study P\u00e1nini's *s\u00fatras* without the aid of a teacher. The text, translation, and notes will not be separately printed, but the translation of each *s\u00fatra* will be given immediately under its Devan\u00e1gari text, and the notes immediately under the translation in smaller type. V\u00e1rttik\u00e1s, Paribh\u00e1sh\u00e1s, Ishtis and K\u00e1rik\u00e1s, whenever they occur will be quoted, translated, and explained. Alphabetical lists of the *s\u00fatras* and *ga\u1e47as* will be appended, as well as an alphabetical glossary of terms with reference to the *s\u00fatras* in which they occur. The work may fairly be called exhaustive, for the specimen which Mr. Gunatilaka has been good enough to send me in MS. indicates that hardly any question can suggest itself to the student of P\u00e1nini in his necessarily laborious study which has not been anticipated and answered. In the explanation of each word, every step taken is supported by authority, in the same manner as a problem or theorem of Euclid. Mr. Gunatilaka's present intention is to issue as a specimen a part of the work consisting of two printed octavo sheets, and to circulate it among Oriental scholars in the hope that a sufficient number of\n\n*A detailed account of the work, which is stated to bear the same relation, as regards matter and arrangement, to Chandra's Grammar as the Laghuk\u00e1umud\u00ed does to that of P\u00e1nini, was published in the Academy of January 24th and 31st, 1880.*\nsubscribers may be found to justify the publication. I trust that our Society may be able to assist Mr. Gunatilaka, both directly and indirectly, in bringing to issue both of these learned and laborious works, and with this view I propose to bring the subject before the Committee.\n\nThe importance of these works and the labour they have involved have induced Mr. Gunatilaka to entrust to another hand the preparation of a new edition of the Meghad\u00fata of K\u00e1lid\u00e1sa from a MS. discovered by him in the Kandy Oriental Library. The text of the poem in this MS., written in Siphalese characters, appears to differ little from the Devan\u00e1gari versions published by Gildemeister and others, but the MS. derives its value from a short appropriate introduction, a literal and correct Siphalese translation, and explanatory notes in Siphalese. In connection with what I have already said, it is especially interesting to note that the Siphalese commentator in this version refers to Chandra in the same way as the commentary of Mallin\u00e1tha supports his views by reference to P\u00e1\u00f1ini. The date of this MS., corresponding to the year 1717 of the Christian era, shows that Sanskrit was studied in Ceylon in the classical period of Siphalese literature equally with P\u00e1li and Elu. It will be published, with the assistance of Mr. Gunatilaka, by Mr. P\u00e1nabokka, late President of Dumbara Gansabh\u00e9wa.\n\nI understand that Pandit Gu\u1e47as\u00e9kara is engaged upon a Siphalese translation of Meghad\u00fata from another version.\n\nA Member of our Society, Mr. W. P. R\u0101pasinha, is preparing a Paper on the Siphalese language, which we hope to include in an early Number of our Journal.\n\nPerhaps the greatest literary need felt in Ceylon is the want of a good Siphalese and English Dictionary, a want of which I am very often reminded in my official capacity. A mixed Committee of Englishmen and Siphalese, to prepare a dictionary on the basis of Clough\u2019s work, seems to be the agency most likely to lead to good results.\n\nI must include under the general head of literature a paper on Hind\u00fa astronomy published in our journal by Mr. S. Mervin, a Tamil gentleman of Jaffna. The writer justly points out that Hind\u00fa astronomy is a very different thing from Hind\u00fa mythology, though many Europeans seem to think that the mythology and the astronomy of the Hind\u00fas are identical. This confusion undoubtedly pervades a brilliant passage in Lord Macaulay\u2019s writings, often quoted to throw ridicule on the scientific pretensions of the ancient Eastern world. The recent studies of scientific scholars have, however, conclusively shown that India early possessed many astronomical facts, many observations of astronomical phenomena, and many rules and methods of astronomical calculation. It is of\ninterest to our Society that native students should recognize that the fantastic legends of Hind\u00fa mythology belong to the domain of poetical imagination, and look for the science of astronomy in S\u016brya Siddh\u0101nta and treatises similar, which remain as the relics of a system of astronomical science carried to a degree of perfection that excites the admiration of modern scientific students.\n\nAlluding to the subject of astronomy, I must here record the generous offer made by Mr. E. Heelis to the Society of a 4-inch aperture astronomical telescope, on condition of an observatory being built for it adjoining the Museum. We were unfortunately obliged to decline this offer from inability to comply with the very reasonable condition attached to it.\n\nArt.\n\nI have very few words to say on this occasion on the subject of Art. Mr. Smither read a paper at our April meeting on some sculptures which he had examined on a visit to Horana. His suggestion that these sculptures should be brought to Colombo so as to be saved from further deterioration and depredations has been carried out, and they were deposited in the Museum a few days ago.\n\nSocial Condition of the People.\n\nThe official position which I occupy leads me naturally to assign the place of first importance under this head to the subject of Public Instruction, but for the same reason I may be allowed to content myself to-day with a reference to my Administration Report, in which I endeavour to give full and explicit information on all the work of my Department. It is however appropriate to this occasion that I should notice with pleasure the assistance I have received from several learned Buddhist priests, both in co-operation with the principal design of the Department and also in the preparation of books for the native youths of the Colony.\n\nAppropriate to the subject of school work is the subject of Games. Mr. Le Mesurier is preparing a Paper on 'The Games of the Kandyans' which will no doubt be an interesting supplement to Mr. Leopold Ludovici's contribution to our Journal for the year 1873, 'On the Sports and Games of the Sinhalese.' If the child is father of the man, it is good for those whose business it is to understand the ways of the men to learn the pursuits of the children, and, as a relaxation from the graver labours of our Society, I do not think that the papers of our Journal offer any contribution so full of genial instruction as Mr. Ludovici's article.\n\nMr. H. C. P. Bell, c.c.s., has a Paper ready on 'Sinhalese Ceremonies connected with P\u00e1di Cultivation in the Low-country, with specimens of songs sung during operations.' A short Paper on the\nsame subject, but limited to a Kandyan (K\u00e9galla) district, by Mr. R. W. Ievers, c.c.s., was published in our Journal for 1880.\n\nThe Proverbs of a people reveal many secrets of their social condition, domestic life, and private morality, and have always therefore been found an attractive study. Mah\u00e1-Mudaliy\u00e1r De Zoysa has published in our Journal another contribution to our knowledge of Sinhalese Proverbs, and I have also to notice the publication of two other collections\u2014the Atita V\u00e1kya D\u00edpuniya, by A. Mendis S\u00e9n\u00e1n\u00e9yaka, and the Puthya V\u00e1kya or Niti-s\u00e1stra, published by A. D. A. Wijayasinha. The aphorisms in the last-mentioned collection are skilfully arranged under separate heads, so as to supply in about 250 short lines a code of public and private morality.\n\nGeology and Mineralogy.\n\nMr. A. C. Dixon, who is the most active member of our Society in the department of Geology and Mineralogy, has continued his visits to different districts for the study of their geological formations. The recent activity of gold-mining operations in Southern India naturally drew attention to the known existence of gold in several parts of this Island, and Mr. Dixon read a short Paper on the subject at our April meeting. He has since \"prospected\" several districts, and has been good enough to furnish me with a summary of his researches. A small nugget taken near Wakwella (Galle) and weighing over 6 grains was tested and found to be genuine alluvial gold, which had been rolled some distance and deposited by an old stream. Careful search at the place revealed no traces of gold. In the Sabaragamuwa district Mr. Dixon visited Rakwana, North and Central Kukulu-k\u00f3ral\u00e9, and Kolonn\u00e1-k\u00f3ral\u00e9. In this district there are several valuable deposits of gems still unworked, but no evidence of gold was found. In the stream which flows past the Assistant Government Agent's bungalow at Ratnapura, further evidence has been found of the existence of gold in considerable quantities. Mr. Dixon has, however, not yet been able to explore this stream. At our Meeting in April Mr. Dixon alluded to his first visit to Ranboda, and exhibited a specimen of gold from the district. On a subsequent visit several well-defined reefs were found, samples of which were sent to London and assayed, yielding 15 grs. to the ton. In Do\u0142os-b\u00e1g\u00e9 two or three good reefs were found, but the yield here was only 4 grs. to the ton, though one sample of surface quartz from the same reef gave 14 grains. In the lower end of Maskeliya valley (\"Theberton\") two good reefs were found. From these gold has been obtained, but not in paying quantities as yet, though the prospect of this district as regards paying gold is considered good. From Rangalla surface quartz has been tested with a yield of 1 dwt. 1\u00bd gr. per ton. From H\u00e9v\u00e1h\u0113ta quartz has been examined yielding 10 grains to the ton. Traces of alluvial gold and platinum were found in the Deduru-oya.\nMr. Dixon has found the reported Mahara gold to be pyrites. Specimens from a quartz reef in Kandawuwa contained 3 per cent. of copper and the element telurium, which is always found in company with gold.\n\nClimate and Meteorology.\n\nThe long connection of Colonel Fyers, R.E., with our Society, of which he has been for many years President, has borne lasting fruit in the establishment of the meteorological observations which may now be considered, I suppose, as a permanent part of the work of his Department. Systematic observations have been carried under Col. Fyers' direction at the principal stations of the Island since 1870. A daily weather report is now published in the Post Office Bulletin, and four morning observations at Colombo, Galle, Trincomalee, Batticaloa, and Jaffna are telegraphed daily to Calcutta for the storm signal service. Copies of the monthly return of daily observations and annual reports, as well as diagrams giving the mean monthly rainfall for the number of years in which observations have been taken, are sent to London, Paris, Brussels, New York, Canada, Calcutta, Batavia, and Algiers, and are noticed in the Administration Report of the Meteorological Department of the Government of India for 1879-80, as follows (p. 37):\n\n'The Island of Ceylon in which a system of meteorological observations has been carried on for some years under the direction of Col. Fyers, R.E., communicates a monthly abstract of observations from which a selection is made for the tabular abstract given in the annual report, and I have lately included an abstract of the rainfall registers communicated to us from Singapore. Thus the extreme geographical range of the region for which meteorological data are collected for discussion during the past years comprises 53 degrees of longitude and 33 degrees of latitude.'\n\nThe period over which systematic observations extend has been as yet too short for reliable deductions to be made from the statistics collected.\n\nMr. J. Stoddart is at present investigating the subject of the very partial ranges of the rainfall in Ceylon, the prevalence of high winds over partial areas, and the influence of the monsoon-gales in the Bay of Bengal, and storms on the Bombay coast and on the coast of Ceylon. In conjunction with Captain Donnan, Master Attendant, he is also taking observations to show the direction, force and altitude of the waves in the Colombo harbour, when the wind is in the North and North-East.\n\nBotany.\n\nThe paramount influence of agriculture on the prosperity of this colony has, to a great extent, removed the department of Botany\nfrom the concerns of this Society to more open and more accessible channels of communication and discussion. The year has been especially marked by the publication of *The Tropical Agriculturist*, a monthly periodical established by the Editors of the *Ceylon Observer*, constituting in the strictest sense of the word a repertory (*repertorium ubi omnia repiriri possint*) of information on all subjects connected with Tropical Botany and Agriculture. To its pages, to the Report of the Director of the Botanical Gardens, and the Reports of Mr. Marshall Ward on Leaf Disease, all who are interested in this subject will naturally refer for the operations of the year. In connection with the Melbourne Exhibition, Mr. William Ferguson was good enough to furnish, at my request, a set of Notes descriptive of 96 specimens of Ceylon timber sent to the Exhibition. I have sent several copies of these Notes to the Government Agents and their Assistants, and to other persons to whom I believe them likely to prove useful. I will only add that an elementary Manual of Botany in Sinhalese has been prepared, and will shortly be published by the Department of Public Instruction. It will, I hope, be the means of carrying profitable instruction and amusement into many humble homes.\n\n**Zoology.**\n\nThe first two parts of the beautiful engravings of *Ceylon Lepidoptera*, with descriptive letterpress, now being published by Government, were received about the middle of the year, and the remaining portion of the work is expected very shortly.\n\nA Paper by Mudaliy\u00e1r Samuel Jayatilaka on the Honey Bees of Ceylon and the native method of Bee Culture was read at our April Meeting. This Paper derived unexpected interest from the visit of Mr. Frank Benton, an American Bee amateur, who had the intention of writing a Paper for our Society on the subject of our bees, but was prevented by a severe attack of malarial fever caught whilst bee hunting in the jungles of the Kurun\u00e9gala District. Mr. Jayatilaka has stated that he got more practical information about bees from Mr. Benton in a week than he had from all other sources in many years. Mr. Benton learned in Java that wax is imported into Netherlands India, chiefly from Holland, to the annual value of two millions of rupees. The wax is chiefly used in dyeing the sarongs and other cloths of the people. Mr. Benton\u2019s visit to Ceylon can hardly fail to be productive of useful results, as the Cyprian bees introduced by him are doing well with Mr. W. H. Wright and Mud\u00e1liy\u00e1r Jayatilaka, who thinks that they are more industrious and faster workers and more tractable than our common Ceylon bees. It is stated that Ceylon bees do not seem to approach vanilla flowers when in bloom, whereas the Cyprians are found continually among them, and it is hoped that they may turn out good fertilizers, and thus save\nmuch of the labour now involved in the process of artificial fertilization. There seems to be no reason why bee culture in Ceylon should not become an industry of considerable importance.\n\nDr. Vanderstraaten read at our October Meeting a synopsis of a Paper which he has prepared on 'Sericulture,' illustrating in detail the process of raising silkworms. As this Paper has not yet been forwarded to our Secretary for publication, I am unable to refer to it. The subject is one of undoubted interest, and I may mention that the Rev. Father Palla is endeavouring at Mount Calvary, Galle, to introduce the rearing of silkworms as an industry well adapted to the habits and inclinations of the people of Ceylon.\n\nMr. Bell's Report on the Maldives.\n\nA considerable part of Col. Eyers' Address last year was devoted to information derived from our Secretary, Mr. H. C. P. Bell, with reference to his recent visit to the Maldivian Islands. Mr. Bell's Report, as the result of this visit, is now being printed as a Sessional Paper by desire of the Secretary of State. I have had the advantage of seeing the proof sheets as printed, and it was my intention to give a summary of the information they contain, as the Papers of our Society may probably come before a circle of readers whom Sessional Papers are not at all likely to reach. For this reason, I regret that the Report has been published as a Sessional Paper and not by our Society, to whose Journal a contribution so comprehensive and complete would have been an acceptable addition. As a Sessional Paper, however, it will no doubt hold a distinct place of its own, and Mr. Bell will perhaps make, or allow others to make, an epitome of its principal results for the benefit of our Journal. I feel that it is impossible to do justice to a labour of such value at the close of a narrative of the Society's work, present and prospective\u2014imperfect, I well know, but likely, I fear, to be thought already prolix.\n\nOn the conclusion of the Address,\n\nThe Hon. W. H. Ravenscroft proposed a vote of thanks to the President for his most able Address, to which he was sure they had all listened with very great pleasure. Mr. W. Ferguson seconded.\n\nHis Excellency the Governor felt sure that the Members round the table had all listened with very great pleasure to that Address.\u2014Motion agreed to nem. con.\n\n7.\u2014A vote of thanks to the Governor for presiding brought the Meeting to a close.\nAdditions to Library.\n\nBibliotheca Indica: A Collection of Oriental Works published by the R.

He therefore suggested that arrangements be made with the \"Ceylon Times\" Press to reprint the Journals Nos. 9-12 (Vol. III.), 1856-1861.

C. P. Bell, Honorary Secretary.\n\n5.\u2014Upon the proposition of the President, it was unanimously carried that Mr. Albert Gray be invited to become an Honorary Member of the Society.\n\n6.\u2014Proceedings closed with votes of thanks to the Secretary for his Paper, and to the Chairman.\n\nThe President read an abstract of a Monograph by Professor Virchow on \"The Veddas of Ceylon,\" based on an examination of 23 reputed Vedd\u00e1 skulls. He believes they are a people of unmixed blood, whilst the Sinhalese are decidedly a mixed race. This opinion, however, is not supported by the researches of Mah\u00e1 Mudaliy\u00e1r De Soysa, who believes them to be the descendants of a son and daughter of Vijaya by a Yakkh\u00e1 princess.\n\nAfter some general conversation on the subject, it was decided to get the Professor's valuable pamphlet translated into English at home for the benefit of Oriental scholars unacquainted with German.\n\nThe Chairman followed this up by an abstract of a Paper on \"Nirvana,\" by Professor Kunt\u00e9, which will be printed in the Journal of the year in extenso.\n\nThe Honorary Secretary, Mr. H. C. P. Bell, read extracts from Mr. A. Gray's translation of a portion of Ibn Batuta's Travels relating to the Maldives (French edition of M. M. Defremery and Sanguinetti), the quaint descriptions in which agreed in the main with the Secretary's observations when at those Islands.\n\nMr. Bell then read an interesting Paper on \"Customs and Ceremonies connected with Padi Cultivation.\" The Paper entered into details showing that at every step taken in the cultivation of their padi\nfields, the villagers sought the advice and aid of soothsayers in order to secure a lucky day for their proceedings. This is done before the cultivator attempts to commence ploughing or treading up the ground. The same is observed in regard to the construction of dams; and before any attempt at sowing seed can be made, ceremonies are gone through in conformity with ancient customs as prescribed by the soothsayers.\n\nMr. Bell gave some specimens of the songs sung by the village cultivators whilst bailing the water out of the fields, as well as during reaping, together with a few strange *kem*, or charms, used to keep off flies, &c., from the ripe ears.\n\nThe after-proceedings of levelling the ground, and preparing it for the reception of seed, were all minutely described, showing as much attention to ceremonial as at any other stage of affairs.\n\nIf the crop promises to be a very good one, a ceremony is performed with a view of securing protection from the evil eye and evil mouth. In the centre of the field small stands are made, decorated with flowers and young cocoanut leaves. Here at night the *Katt\u00e1diy\u00e1*, dressed up fantastically, dances a sort of devil dance in the centre of the platform, lights being kept burning at the corners until morning.\n\nThere are also certain observances at the time of threshing the corn. Before the sheaves can be removed from the stacks, where they were placed from the field, five or seven mats are spread on the ground and three circles and two straight lines (with four of their agricultural implements) are drawn with ashes: in the centre are placed sea-shells, a little cow-dung with a little silver, copper, brass, iron, and ashes. This being done, some one believed to be lucky places a sheaf of corn on his head, walks up to the spot, and bows to the four corners; other men then bring in the ear, and spread it on the mats, and bullocks are brought in to begin the work.\n\nThe removal of the threshed corn is also a matter of ceremony. When all the grain is free from straw, the chief villager goes to the centre of the p\u00e1di, whilst the others heap it up around him as high as his knees. When this is done the heap is covered with mats, and the man in the centre, after certain forms, jumps down backwards. Then other observances follow prescribed by long custom.\n\nAll the p\u00e1di is then removed home. Before any of it is taken for use one or two handfuls are again separated. This, with some other p\u00e1di, is pounded by the women at night, and part of it is boiled, and cakes made with the rest. Before they begin this, the women bathe and put on clean clothes, and it is necessary that none of it should be tasted during the preparation. The neighbours are invited in the morning to enjoy this *Deviy\u00e1nne d\u00e1naya*, and the *Kapur\u00e1la*, lay priest of the *D\u00e9v\u00e1la*, is called in. All the people assembled sit down on mats spread on the compound, and the rice and vegetable curries, cakes and plantains, being served them on plantain leaves, the *Kapur\u00e1la* sings certain songs to bring prosperity on the cultivator. Meanwhile a table is prepared inside the house with everything cooked for the occasion. When the songs are over, he tastes everything, and sprinkles water on the people and their rice, which is the\nsignal for them to commence eating.\u2014(Ceylon Observer, February 16th, 1882.)\n\nThe information contained in Mr. Bell's very interesting paper, read to the Asiatic Society, on ceremonies amongst the Siphalese in connection with padi cultivation, conveys a lesson which should be well considered in reference to agricultural improvements amongst people who have been stigmatised as indolent and apathetic in the extreme.\n\nWe shall not be wrong if we say that the Siphalese people are fully as much imbued with feelings of superstition as any other race, notwithstanding that Buddhism is in its very nature opposed to anything approaching superstitious practices.\n\nPerhaps in no other occupation are superstitious observances so frequently and so thoroughly observed as in agriculture. This may be owing to frequent unfavourable seasons and failure of crops, which have led native cultivators to trust so much to charms and observances in the hope of warding off further disaster. From the earliest commencement of the cultivator's toils, the preparation of the ground to the garnering of the corn, the soothsayer is consulted, and his instructions devoutly followed by the ignorant villagers. A lucky day must be sought for turning the first sod of the saturated ground, and for sprinkling the first sowing of the season. In the hope of warding off pests and insects from the growing cornfield, rules have to be observed, and ceremonies performed; and the same with every operation connected with harvesting.\n\nBut Mr. Bell is careful to tell us that these childish observances are fast dying out amongst all but the most ignorant. He says most of these absurd and superstitious customs and usages, though still observed by some old cultivators, are little regarded by their juniors, and are but slowly but surely dying out. These men are unable to account for the performance of these ceremonies, and he adds that the majority of cultivators attribute the failure of crops in their villages during the past few years to the non-observance and gradual decline of faith in these ceremonies.\n\nIf, as believed by Mr. Bell, these absurd practices are fast dying out, there may be some prospect of inducing cultivators to turn their attention to improved modes of agriculture, and so in time bettering their condition. It is within the memory of living men that in many parts of the United Kingdom superstitions as absurd as any described in this paper prevailed amongst the rural population, especially in remote districts, and we know that it is only within the last twenty years that any real progress has been made in English agriculture, Scotland, to its credit, having set the example. We are therefore surely justified in hoping that as superstition dies out in this country, improvements in agriculture may take their place.\u2014(Ceylon Times, 17th February, 1882. \"Superstition or Progress.\")\nAdditions to Library.\n\nAgriculture, Department of, Report, 1878 and 1879, 2 Vols., Washington, 1880.\n\nArch\u00e6ological Survey of India: Tours in the Central Dool and Gorakhpur in 1874-75 and 1875-76, by Major-General A.

Secretary laid on the table a list of books received since last meeting.\n\n(i.) The Hon. Secretary read a Paper, entitled \"Buddha's Sermon on Omens,\" by L. De Zoysa, Mah\u00e1 Mudaliy\u00e1r.\nA short discussion followed, in the course of which Mr. Bruce remarked that it appeared to him the best rendering to bring out the exact meaning of the words \"etan mangalan uttamay\" would be \"these are the best things to bring luck;\" that this seemed to him to have a very appropriate meaning, more appropriate than the word \"omen.\"\n\nIn reply to a remark from the Chairman, Mr. Bruce said that undoubtedly the general meaning given to the words by the Mah\u00e1 Mudaliy\u00e1r was right, but perhaps not sufficiently comprehensive.\n\nAt this stage of the proceedings the Lieutenant-Governor left, and Mr. Bruce took the Chair.\n\n(ii.) The Hon. Secretary read a Paper on \"Folk Lore in Ceylon,\" W. Gunatilaka, Esq.\n\n5.\u2014The Meeting concluded with the usual vote of thanks to the Chair.\n\nA Paper, \"Buddha's Sermon on Omens,\" by L. De Zoysa, Mah\u00e1 Mudaliy\u00e1r, was first read. It was in reality, an essay in disproof of the theory that Buddha's teaching inculcated caste and superstition; and quotations were given in support of this from the Buddhist Scriptures. Mr. De Zoysa was careful to emphasize the declaration with which his paper commenced, to the effect that the founder of Buddhism repudiated caste and superstition both in theory and practice; at the same time he admitted that in a country like Ceylon in which Hinduism had prevailed before the introduction of Buddhism, caste and superstition still exist, although in a modified form.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Paper (which was somewhat technical in its contents), Mr. Bruce alluded to the particular words quoted by the author as being Sanskrit. He had been in correspondence with Mr. De Zoysa, but had not as yet had the reply he had hoped for. The word on which so much stress was laid appeared to signify anything done to procure or invoke a blessing or success; it was even applicable to a portion of the marriage ceremony.\n\nThe reading of Mr. Gunatilaka's paper on \"Folk Lore in Ceylon\" was then proceeded with, and was listened to with the interest the subject claimed. The author alluded to this field of research as one almost entirely neglected, but which offered the greatest inducements for enquiry and research. A complete collection would of course be a work of time, but this work would be materially aided if Members who came across any stories illustrative of the subject would publish them from time to time in the Society's Journal. His own contribution in the present instance was but the commencement of a work in which he trusted others would join. He reminded his readers that Mr. Steele, in his translation of the Kusa J\u00e1taka, had given as an appendix a few Sinhalese stories to which he added some remarks on the large collection of household stories that might be made in Ceylon.\nThe author of the Paper related one story only, but it was of sufficient interest to render his Paper attractive, and will no doubt be read by very many with great enjoyment. It was a story told in illustration of the strong powers held over a woman by avarice and cunning, and relates to the native custom of what is known amongst them as \"giving and taking sil\" at the hands of the Buddhist priesthood.\n\nMr. R\u00e1ma-N\u00e1than believed that many of the household tales current in Ceylon partook freely of Tamil characteristics; indeed, he remembered a story similar to that just read to them, in which all the characters were Hind\u00fas.\n\nMr. James mentioned as a fact, that Sinhalese versions of many of the Western fairy tales and legends were being printed at one or two native presses, and he believed there was a very active demand for all such works, as well as for purely Sinhalese stories.\u2014(Times of Ceylon, September 15th, 1882.)\n\nAdditions to Library.\n\nAnsflug nach dem Adamspik auf Ceylon, by Franenfeld, Wien, 1859.\nArabian Poetry for English Readers, by W.

A ground plan and sketch of the site accompanied the Report.\n\n(b) Letter from L. De Zoysa, Mah\u00e1-Mudaliy\u00e1r, in defence of his rendering of the word M\u00e1mini by \u201cO great man!\u201d in his note on the V\u00e9d\u00e1s (C. A. S.

Lewis, Esq.\n\nMr. James then read portions of his Paper on \u201cSighalese Folklore.\u201d\n\n5.\u2014A vote of thanks to the Chairman brought the Meeting to a close.\n\n* With reference to the Honorary Secretary\u2019s footnote on my rendering of the words \u092e\u093e\u092e\u093f\u0928\u0940 (m\u00e1mini) \u2018O great man,\u2019 to the effect that Bailey translates \u2018my gem,\u2019 I feel bound to state the reasons which led me to render the words as I have done. I recollect the late Mr. Bailey consulting me on the meaning of the words in question, and my telling him that I was unable to offer a satisfactory explanation. It will also be seen on reference to my translation of these songs published in the Ceylon Observer of 16th October, 1875, that I left these words untranslated, as I was not in a position then to offer a satisfactory translation. I have stated in my note that \u201cwhen at Badulla, in 1879, a low-country Sighalese man gave me much information regarding the V\u00e9d\u00f3.\u201d (Journal, Vol. VII., Pt. II., p. 97). On enquiry of this man, he at once and without any hesitation explained that the word m\u00e1mini means \u2018great man\u2019 from m\u00e1, \u2018great\u2019 and mini, \u2018man.\u2019 Mini in the V\u00e9d\u00e1 dialect is the word used for man. It is evidently derived from the Sanskrit word \u092e\u0928\u0941 (manu) \u2018progenitor of mankind,\u2019 and \u092e\u0928\u0941\u0937\u094d\u092f (manushya) \u2018man.\u2019 Hence the Sighalese \u092e\u093f\u0928\u093f\u0939 (minih\u00e1) \u092e\u093f\u0928\u093f\u0938 (minisa) and the M\u00e1ldivian mihun (Sighalese, \u092e\u093f\u0928\u093f\u092f\u093e? miniy\u00e1). I may add that in vernacular Sighalese the word \u092e\u093f\u0928\u093f (mini) is used both as an adjective and a noun\u2014e.g., \u092e\u093f\u0928\u093f\u092f\u093e (mini eta) means \u2018human bone,\u2019 \u092e\u093f\u0928\u093f\u0935\u093e\u0932 (mini wala) a \u2018human grave,\u2019 \u092e\u093f\u0928\u093f\u092e\u093e\u0930\u093e\u0935 (mini maranaw) is \u2018to kill men,\u2019 \u092e\u093f\u0928\u093f\u092f\u093e (miniya) a \u2018dead human body,\u2019 and it is also used for \u2018a funeral.\u2019 I think the words might also be translated \u2018my (our) man!\u2019 but I have thought the rendering I have adopted more appropriate as it tallies with the well-known worship of the ancestors by the V\u00e9d\u00f3, who regard the spirits of their dead as both men and gods.\n\nKegoda, 27th September, 1882.\n\nL. De Zoysa.\nThe Hon. Secretary read a letter forwarded to the Society by the Colonial Secretary from the Assistant Government Agent (P. A. Templer, Esq.) at Puttalam, on some ruins at a place called Veheragala, situated about two miles south of the 10th mile-post on the Anuradhapura road.\n\nThese ruins consist for the most part of groups of stone pillars more or less roughly squared. The neighbourhood is so much overgrown with jungle that it is difficult fully to make out their formation, or to conjecture to what period they belong. The oval-shaped building was found on a rocky mound. Its base is constructed of slabs of rock laid upon oblong blocks. The building faces north, on which side there is a flight of stone steps, and its dimensions are 56 feet from N.S., and 78 feet from E. to W.\n\nThe letter was accompanied by a sketch of the building, and a ground plan, as well as a copy of an inscription found on a slab near the flight of steps.\n\nMr. Templer thinks the building could not be intended for a Tope or D\u00e1gaba, owing to its oval shape; at any rate, in that case it can never have been completed.\n\nA discussion on the letter followed, in which it was agreed that it would be advisable to have the jungle in the neighbourhood cleared and experimental excavations made. It was also agreed to ask the opinion of Mr. Smither on the subject, and if necessary to refer the inscription to Dr. M\u00fcller, the late Government Archaeologist.\n\nThe Honorary Secretary read a letter from Mah\u00e1 Mudaliy\u00e1r De Zoysa, in defence of his rendering of the word M\u00e1mini by \u2018O great man!\u2019 in his Paper on the Vedd\u00e1s, published in the last Journal of the Society, as opposed to the late Mr. J. Bailey\u2019s translation \u2018my gem.\u2019\n\nA discussion ensued, and the consensus of opinion of those present seemed to be in favour of Mr. Bailey\u2019s translation.\n\nThe Honorary Secretary then read Mr. F. Lewis\u2019s Paper, \u201cNotes on the Microscopical characteristics of Feathers.\u201d It was pointed out that there is scope for more research in regard to the form and shape of feathers. A breast feather pulled from a well-known bird will show that in the basal region the quill supports a shaft, which in turn, towards the lower half of the feather, bears a fine thread-like process, say, one-tenth of an inch long, which Mr. Lewis calls the \u201csub-web shaft.\u201d In the upper part of the feather this sub-web shaft is absent. Supposing a web-shaft is removed from the same feather and placed under a microscope of some power, the sub-web shaft will exhibit a series of point-like markings of a more or less modified character.\n\nThe conclusion the author has arrived at, after examining a large series of Ceylon birds, is that they are modifications of an aboriginal form, his conclusion being derived from the fact that in remote periods of time, it is but fair to suppose, birds required a closer plumage than at present, in order to endure a colder temperature, and to bring about that end a further addition to the sub-web shaft would render most material assistance. By this peculiarity of struc-\nture, the writer believes we shall be able to trace the relative ages of existing forms of birds.\n\nMr. Lewis's Paper was illustrated by some neat sketches of feathers.\n\nIn the ensuing discussion the Chairman remarked that the modification of feathers on the different parts of the body of a bird was exactly what would be expected looking at the adaptation of means in all nature. Mr. Bell regretted that at present there were no other ornithologists in Ceylon who might have given their opinion on the subject; he had referred the matter to Mr. Staniforth Green, but unfortunately the subject was not in that gentleman's range of study. Mr. W. K. James pointed out that the subject of feathers had already received attention at the hands of some British ornithologists, but that probably Mr. Lewis had had no opportunity of seeing any articles on the subject. It was also to be regretted that he had been unable to examine specimens of feathers of birds from higher latitudes, which would furnish, no doubt, additional evidence for or against his theory; but apart from the theory, the actual observations made by Mr. Lewis would be no doubt of considerable value. The existing forms of feathers were no doubt modifications of an ideal type feather, and could be accounted for by Darwin's theory of natural selection. Mr. Fre\u00fcdenberg said he would be glad to send the Paper to the Berlin Academy for an opinion as to the signification of Mr. Lewis's experiments. This was unanimously agreed to.\n\nAs Mr. W. P. R\u0101nasipha's Paper on \"The connection of Sinhalese with the Modern Aryan Vernaculars of India\" was of a character which made it difficult to be read at the meeting, the President of the Society (C. Bruce, Esq., c.m.g.,) had kindly prepared the following summary:\u2014\"In this Paper Mr. R\u0101nasipha discusses the question whether the Sinhalese language is to be assigned to the Turanian or to the Aryan or Indo-Germanic family. The evidence adduced to show that it must be assigned to the latter is drawn from the inflectional and analytical structure of the words; from the distinction between nouns and verbs; from the terminational indications of number and case in nouns; and formation of personal terminations in verbs by abraded pronouns or pronominal types. From a comparison of the numerals as a part of language, which retains its forms with the greatest tenacity, it is that the Sinhalese has followed, with the remarkable fidelity, the Pr\u00e1krit language or dialect, which Professor Max M\u00fcller takes to be the basis of all Aryan vernaculars of India. Consistently with the modifications found in the structure of Pr\u00e1krit forms, the Sinhalese language avoids the combination of two or more consonants without an intervening vowel; drops consonants in the middle of words, and avoids hiatus either by coalition of words or the insertion of semi-vowels. These evidences are followed by a comparison of the Sinhalese names for the members of the body with those of the Aryan vernaculars of India. Mr. R\u0101nasipha then formulates certain laws, 13 in number, which he finds controlling the modifications of Sanskr\u00edt and Pr\u00e1krit forms by vowel and consonant changes in Sinhalese. The Paper closes with a long list of words, in\nwhich, subject to such modifications, are P\u0101li, Pr\u0101k\u1e5bit, Sanskrit and several of the modern Aryan vernaculars of India.\"\n\nMr. R\u0101\u1e47asipa's Paper was looked upon as of the highest interest and value, and it is to be hoped that the Society will have still more results of his scholarship.\n\nThe Paper on \"Sinhalese Folk-lore,\" by Mr. W. K. James, contains some interesting details regarding the social character and habits of the people of this country. There is amongst the Sinhalese a strong attachment to home and friends, and there are reminiscences dear to him which recall the days of his childhood. It is natural, therefore, that home stories exercise influence on him, and that these are stored up in his memory. In the night, as two or three villagers sit guarding their ripening p\u0101di, it is the recital of these stories which wile away the long hours of watching. Some of the stories related are not very complimentary to the intelligence of the Sinhalese villager, but nevertheless the folk-lore which has been handed down from generation to generation illustrates the ways and the words of much of the rural population, and in this sense they are full of interest.\u2014(Times of Ceylon, November 4th, 1882.)\n\nAdditions to Library.\n\nAccessions to Indian Museum, Appendix A., 1881.\nArch\u00e6ological Survey of India, Vols. 13 and 14, by Major-General A.

Bell, Esq., Honorary Secretary.\n\n1.\u2014Read and confirmed Minutes of General Meeting held on November 2nd.\n\n2.\u2014The Secretary drew attention to the rules of the Society. He said some suggestions for the amendment of the rules had been received, but he thought it would be better to let the matter lie over till the next annual General Meeting. There were two rules in particular which seemed to require revision. The first related to the Committee. The Committee, as at present constituted, consisted of nine members. The suggestion was to alter the wording of the rule so as to make it read \"not less than nine members.\" The second rule was with reference to the Papers read before the Society. The\nexisting rule is that Papers should be sent in to the Secretary \"at least a week before the meeting at which they are to be read is held.\" It had been found that a week was not sufficient to allow of the Papers being circulated among the members of the Reading Committee and properly digested by them. It was therefore proposed to go back to the former rule and alter \"week\" to \"fortnight,\" or, better still, \"three weeks.\" He had compared the existing rules with those in force twenty years ago, and he found they were substantially the same. A complete revision seemed desirable.\n\nMr. Wall suggested that, if any particular rules were found to be inconvenient, they might be properly amended at once, leaving a general revision of the rules for the next Annual Meeting.\n\nSome discussion ensued on the two rules, and it was eventually decided to leave the rules as regards the Committee intact, but to alter the rules as regards the time by which Papers should be sent in to the Secretary to \"a fortnight.\"\n\n3.\u2014The Secretary read the following letter from Mr. Bruce, conveying his resignation as President of the Society:\n\n---\n\nColombo, 13th December.\n\nDear Sir,\u2014I am very sorry that my departure from Ceylon has been hurried by my having to catch the next Mauritius steamer from Aden, that I have had no opportunity of taking formal leave of the Asiatic Society. My appointment as Colonial Secretary of Mauritius makes it necessary for me to resign the office of President of the Society. In doing so, I desire to express to the Society my sense of the great distinction they conferred upon me by electing me to the post. I shall always retain a very grateful sense of the good-will the Society has shown me and an agreeable recollection of our work together. I trust that the Society will long continue to flourish, and that every year will find in the pages of the Transactions and Journals contributions of a value equal to the last few years. With many friendly recollections and all good-wishes,\n\nBelieve me, &c.,\n\nH. C. P. Bell, Esq., Hon. Sec.\n\nCHAS. BRUCE.\n\nThe Secretary said that it was his duty to announce that the only remaining Vice-President, Hon. W. H. Ravenscroft, had consented to accept the office of President, and he felt sure Mr. Ravenscroft's election would be unanimously approved.\n\nMr. J. H. De Saram proposed and Mr. T. H. Lloyd seconded that the following gentlemen be elected Office Bearers for the ensuing year:\n\n[His Excellency the Governor is the Patron, and the Hon. J. Douglas, c.m.g., Vice-Patron.]\n\nPresident.\u2014Hon. W. H. Ravenscroft.\n\nVice-Presidents.\u2014Hon. J. F. Dickson, M.A., c.c.s., and Geo. Wall, Esq., f.c.s.\n\nTreasurer.\u2014J. G. Dean, Esq.\n\nSecretary.\u2014H. C. P. Bell, Esq., c.c.s.\nThe following gentlemen were invited to join the Committee:\u2014T. Berwick, Esq.; W. Blair, Esq.; J. Capper, Esq.; J. B. Cull, Esq., M.A.; Major Ewing; W. Ferguson, Esq., F.L.S.; P. Freudenberg, Esq.; Rev. E. F. Miller, M.A.; and J. L. Vanderstraaten, Esq., M.D.\n\nThe motion was carried nem. con.\n\nHon. W. H. Ravenscroft rose and thanked the members for electing him President. He said: \"Gentlemen,\u2014In accepting the honor, which I have much pleasure in doing now, of President of the Ceylon Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, I feel that it is but right and fitting that I should do so with very great diffidence. I feel that there are many others that are far more able to fill the position, which is one of no small responsibility, and which requires an amount of special knowledge that is possessed by many other members of the Society in a far greater degree than myself. I trust, however, with the assistance of our able and energetic Secretary, who is thoroughly conversant with the matters and subjects which come within the scope of this most valuable Association, that the records of the coming year will show that much good and useful work has been done, and that at its close we may all feel we have gained much valuable knowledge. In conclusion, I would advert to the great loss we have sustained in the departure of our late President, Mr. Bruce, who was possessed to a remarkable degree of the talents and special knowledge required to further the interests of the Royal Asiatic Society. While deploring our loss, I am sure you will all join me in cordially congratulating Mr. Bruce upon the well-merited advancement (hear, hear) he has received, and the sincere hope that further promotion will be his lot ere long.\" (Applause.)\n\nA cordial vote of thanks to Mr. Bruce for his services as President was carried with acclamation.\n\n5.\u2014The Secretary laid on the table the usual financial statement prepared by the Honorary Treasurer, showing a balance to the good of Rs. 141.08.\n\n6.\u2014The Secretary then read the Annual Report of the Committee on the past year, as follows:\n\nREPORT.\n\n\"The Society has reason to be satisfied with the work of the past year. The signs of returning life put forth in 1881 have continued to develop since, and afford ground for the belief that the Society has once more passed out of a critical stage, and is in a fair way to regain its former vigour. It is additionally encouraging to feel assured by the friendly congratulations of kindred bodies in other parts of the world that the well-being of the Ceylon Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society is a matter of cordial interest far outside this Island.\n\n\"Your Central Committee has endeavoured, as far as practicable in Colombo, to further the Society's interests, but would take this opportunity of inviting the more active co-operation of members in general, and particularly of out-station members. There is need for this appeal. An institution of this nature must rely for support...\"\nalmost entirely on itself, and cannot look for permanent success unless individual members will bear a share in the work as a whole. That the necessity for this inter-dependence between the trunk\u2014so to speak\u2014and its limbs is not sufficiently recognized, the Committee have to notice with regret. Non-resident members\u2014and a large proportion come under this category\u2014have, speaking generally, better means of prosecuting the literary and scientific studies within the Society's scope. The field of research is for them necessarily wider and more varied. Detailed accounts of outlying districts\u2014of the pursuits, peculiar superstitions, and folklore of the natives, which would rightly find no place in condensed official Administration Reports\u2014should furnish material for a series of Papers eminently suitable for our Journal. What in unpretentious fashion a Lewis could perform for Safragam* or a Brodie for Chilaw\u2020 might well be followed by many an outstation Government officer, or private estate owner, desirous of throwing all possible light on the condition of the people themselves and the commercial prospects of particular districts.\n\n\"Many branches of inquiry naturally suggest themselves. Such are specified in the preamble to our Rules and Regulations. Thus the able investigations of Drs. Goldschmidt and M\u00fcller in recent years have given prominence to the subject of archaeology. This is one of the principal objects contemplated by the Society, and well worthy the assiduous study of its members. Further inquiries conducted systematically are likely to yield discoveries of no less moment. A recent report by Mr. P. A. Templer, c.c.s., received through Government, on the hitherto unknown ruins at Vecheragala, between Puttalum and Anur\u0101dhapura, is a case in point.\n\n\"Members.\u2014During the year, 22 new members were elected, and 3 gentlemen, formerly members, re-admitted to the Society. By death or other causes, we have lost 7 members. There are at present 10 life-members (among whom the Lord Bishop of Colombo has recently been enrolled), four honorary members, and 111 ordinary members, or a total numerical strength of 125, as compared with 109 in 1881, and 72 in 1880. This steady increase is another proof that the Society is growing in favour.\n\n\"Meetings.\u2014Three general meetings have been held; the first in February and one each in September and November. As pointed out in the last year's Report, much of the success of such a Society as this depends upon frequent and regular meetings, and the Committee regret that an interval of seven months should have elapsed between the first and second meeting. This was partly due to the great difficulty of convening meetings in Colombo during the hot season, and partly, it must be confessed, to the apathy of the members themselves in not keeping the Hon. Secretary supplied with a sufficiency of Papers.\n\n\"Papers.\u2014This apathy has, however, been condoned during the last few months. In response to a special call by the Honorary\n\n* C. A. S. Journ., 1849. \u2020 C. A. S. Journ., 1858.\nSecretary, several Papers of considerable interest were sent in and read at the meetings of September and November. Others since received will shortly be circulated among the Reading Committee in anticipation of a meeting early next year, whilst more have been definitely promised. The following Papers were read at general meetings during the year:\n\n1.\u2014Abstract of Professor Virchow's Monograph on the Veddas of Ceylon. *Uber die Weddas von Ceilon und ihre Bziehungen zu den Nachbarstammen*, by the President, C. Bruce, Esq., c.m.g.\n\n2.\u2014Abstract of a paper on \"Nirwana,\" by Professor M. Kunt\u00e9, also by the President.\n\n3.\u2014Extracts from Mr. Albert Gray's translation from the French of the Maldivian portion of Ibn Batuta's Travels (*Voyages d'Ibn Batoutah*, Tome, 4e 110\u2014185, Paris, 1879.)\n\n4.\u2014\"Ceremonies and Customs connected with Padi Cultivation,\" by H. C. P. Bell, Esq., Honorary Secretary.\n\n5.\u2014\"Buddha's Sermon on Omens,\" by L. de Zoyza, Mah\u00e1 Mudaliy\u00e1r.\n\n6.\u2014\"Folk-lore in Ceylon,\" by Mr. W. Gunatilaka.\n\n7.\u2014\"Notes on the Microscopical Characteristics of Feathers,\" by F. Lewis.\n\n8.\u2014Abstract of Mr. W. P. Ranasingha's Paper on \"Sinhalese as compared with the modern Aryan Vernaculars of India,\" by the President.\n\n9.\u2014\"Sinhalese Folklore,\" by W. K. James.\n\n\"All these Papers will appear in the Journal for the year.\n\n\"The outlook for 1883 is no less satisfactory. Mr. Ranasingha has promised to follow up his valuable contribution to Sinhalese philology by a further Paper on the same subject.\n\n\"Dr. E. M\u00fcller has sent out for the Society \"Notes on Sinhalese Inscriptions\" in continuation of those published by the late Dr. Goldschmidt and himself in our Journals of 1879 and 1880 (Nos. 20 and 21.)\n\nLouis De Zoysa, Mah\u00e1 Mudaliy\u00e1r, has in hand a short Paper enunciating Buddha's view of caste.\n\n\"Mr. F. Lewis is turning his ornithological studies to some purpose and has favoured the Committee with some \"Ornithological Notes from the Bogawantala district.\" There is perhaps too prevalent an opinion that Captain Legge has quite exhausted the subject of Ceylon Birds, and it is to be hoped that the example set by Mr. Lewis will bring out similar workers in other districts.\n\n\"Mr. J. P. Lewis, c.c.s., has prepared an account of the little known \"Ceylon Gypsies\"\u2014a class to which the snake charmers and jugglers who haunt the precincts of our hotels would seem to belong.\n\n\"The Hon. J. F. Dickson, M.A., c.c.s., has promised a Paper on \"Buddhist Meetings.\" Mr. A. C. Dixon has one nearly ready on \"The Geological Section of the new Kelani Bridge,\" which is likely\nto bear curiously on the legendary history of La\u1e45k\u0101. In addition to these, some of the Papers alluded to in the President's address last year will probably see the light in the course of 1883.\n\n\"Publications.\u2014The Society's Transactions have not appeared as regularly as could be wished. This is attributable to the pressure of work in the Government Printing Office, and has been unavoidable. The Committee has therefore reluctantly decided to face the cost of printing at other presses, and has entrusted the Journal for 1882 to the \"Times of Ceylon\" Press. The Government Printing Office was, however, able to turn out, in its usual excellent style, the \"Proceedings, 1881,\" and \"Journal No. 24, 1881, Pt. II.\", besides a reprint of \"Journal Vol. VI., No. 1, 1853\" (now classed as Vol. II., No. 6), and may possibly be able to help us from time to time.\n\n\"Upon the recommendation of the President, a special grant of Rs. 100 was made to Mr. W. Gunatilaka, of Kandy, towards his new edition of P\u0101\u1e47ini's Sutras. A portion of the work (Vol. I., pp. 1\u201449), printed in Bombay, has been issued in connection with the last number of the Society's Journal.\n\n\"With the object of rendering the translation of Ibn Bat\u016bta's Travels\u2014offered to the Society by Mr. Albert Gray in 1881\u2014more valuable by the accurate identification of places, proof sheets of the Ceylon portion printed side by side with Dr. Lee's version were distributed among members and others whose assistance were courted. Some excellent suggestions have been received, and these, with Mr. Gray's own notes and others which the Hon. Secretary (Mr. H. C. P. Bell, c.c.s.) will be in a position to supply for the section relating to the Maldive Islands, will ensure an interesting and important addition to our knowledge of the history of Ceylon and its dependency.\n\n\"Library.\u2014By presentations and purchase the library has gained a considerable accession of books and pamphlets. A catalogue on the alphabetic system has at length been compiled\u2014thanks in great measure to the generous aid of one of our members, Mr. W. E. Davidson, c.c.s. The want had begun to be seriously felt owing to the very considerable additions with which the library had been enriched since the issue of the last catalogue in 1870. This had long been out of print. \"By the removal to the Museum building in 1876 of the books belonging to the Society\"\u2014we quote from the preface\u2014\"the majority of members was virtually debarred from the use of the library. This ban was but partially removed by subsequent resolutions of the Museum Committee. Its former privileges have now, however, been restored to the Society generally, whilst outstation members have the further boon secured to them of being enabled, under the new library rules, to take out books, &c.\" This will tend to minimize the disadvantage under which they labour of rarely being able to attend the Society's meetings, and be a fairer compensation than the receipt of the Transactions alone for their subscriptions.\n\n\"Money.\u2014The Hon. Treasurer's statement of the year's accounts laid on the table shows a balance of Rs. 141\u00b708. This is likely to be augmented before the close of the year by the recovery of subscriptions and entrance fees outstanding to the amount of Rs. 233. A large\nproportion of the funds, Rs. 607\u00b754, has again been devoted to the purchase and binding of books for the library. The new catalogue cost Rs. 260\u00b750\u2014an exceptional charge which must be incurred periodically. Under special payments appear a grant to Mr. W. Gunatilaka of Rs. 100 towards his edition of P\u0101\u1e47ini, and Rs. 59\u00b708, five years' subscription to the P\u0101li Text Society lately started in England. Against the balance, however, the prospective cost of the year's Journal must be set.\n\n\"President's Address.\u2014The hurried departure of Mr. Bruce for his new sphere of work in Mauritius precluded the possibility of the usual address by the President at the annual meeting. The exhaustive address with which Mr. Bruce opened his tenure of the President's office last December gave earnest of a like interesting close to our Proceedings this year, and had circumstances allowed of Mr. Bruce's remaining a few weeks longer in Ceylon this anticipation would no doubt have been fulfilled. The letter of resignation which has been read was not needed to prove the sincere active interest Mr. Bruce ever continued to take in the Society. In recording its keen sense of the hearty and substantial aid rendered by Mr. Bruce, and its deep regret at losing him from the Society, your Committee is confident that it expresses the genuine feeling of the Society.\"\n\nMr. Capper proposed, and Mr. Wall seconded, that the Report be adopted.\u2014Carried.\n| Dr. | The Honorary Treasurer in Account with the Royal Asiatic Society (Ceylon Branch.) | Cr. |\n|-----|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----|\n| To balance on 1st January | ... | 483 66 |\n| ,, Amount of annual subscription, entrance fees, and sale of journals | ... | 1,068 28 |\n| Amount of subscriptions and entrance fees outstanding | ... | 233 0 |\n| Total | Rs. 1,551 94 | |\n\n| By W.

M. Deffremery and Sanguinetti, by ALBERT GRAY, M.R.A.S., late of the Ceylon Civil Service.]\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nThe wonderful travels of Ibn Bat\u00fata are a record alike of the commercial activity of the Arabs, and of the far-reaching power of the Bagdad caliphate, whose influence long survived its overthrow. From the swift rise of the Muhammadan power in the seventh century down to the arrival of Vasco di Gama at Calicut in 1498, the trade of Europe with the East was in the hands of the Arabs. The carrying to Europe was done by their ships, but in the Indian seas a vast coast trade was developed by all the nations of the Indian sea-bord\u2014Persians, the races of India, Ceylon, the Eastern Islands and China. After the rounding of the Cape followed in succession the restrictive monopolies of the Portuguese, Dutch, and English, and the Eastern nations have never regained the great and free international commerce of the Arab days.\n\nFrom the story of Ibn Bat\u00fata, one comes to understand how it was possible for a native of Tangiers in the fourteenth century to travel, with but little difficulty, for twenty-four years over every country between Morocco and China. The Muhammadan faith had been spread over a great part of India, and had established a footing in China: Arab merchants were everywhere: and ships were never long in demand for voyages from any one port to any other.\nIbn Bat\u016bta was born at Tangiers in 1304, and died at Fez 1377\u20138. The following summary of his travels of twenty-four years (1325 to 1349) is given by Dr. Birdwood of the India Office. From Tangiers he travelled across Africa to Alexandria, and in Palestine, Syria, and Arabia: down the east coast of Africa to Quilon: across the Indian Ocean to Muscat, Ormuz, Kish, Bahrein and El Catif: through Central Arabia to Mecca and Jeddah: and again in Egypt and Asia Minor, and across the Black Sea to Caffa or Theodosia, and by Azov or Tana \u2018on past the hills of the Russians\u2019 to Bolgar on the Volga\u2014but not daring to penetrate further northwards into \u2018the land of Darkness.\u2019 Returning south to Haj-Tarkhan (Astrakhan) he proceeded in the suite of the wife of the Khan of Kipchah, the daughter of the Greek Emperor Andronicus, westward to Soldaia and Constantiniah (Constantinople), whence returning to Bolgar he travelled on eastward to Bokhara, and through Khorassan to Cabul, Multan, and Delhi where he remained eight years (1334-42). Being sent on an embassy to China he embarked at Kin-baiat (Cambay), and after many adventures at Calicut (where he was honorably received by the \u2018Samari\u2019 or Zamorin) and Hunawar (Onore), and in the M\u00e1ldiv\u00e9 Islands (beginning of 1343\u2014August, 1344) and Ceylon and Bengal, he at last took his passage toward China in a junk bound for Java, as he calls it, but in fact Sumatra. Returning from China, he sailed direct from the coast of Malabar to Muscat and Ormuz: and travelling by Shiraz, Bagdad, Jerusalem, Damascus and for the fourth time to Mecca, Egypt, Tunis, at last reached Fez again, after an absence of half his life-time. Subsequently he spent six years in Spain and Central Africa, where he was the guest of the brother of a countryman of his own from Ceutra, whose guest he had been in China. \u201cWhat an enormous distance lay between these two!\u201d he exclaims.\n\nThe first detailed account of his book was published in Europe only in 1808. Moura in 1845 commenced a translation in Portuguese of a copy obtained at Fez at the end of last century. The abridgment translated by Lee was brought from the east by Burckhart. It was not till the French conquest of Algeria that the best and completest texts were obtained. Five are in the Imperial Library at Paris, only two of which are perfect. From these M. M. Defr\u00e9my and Sanguinetti made their translation for the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Asiatique: and it is from their version that the present account of the M\u00e1ldives and Ceylon visithas been extracted. His description of the M\u00e1ldives is the most interesting and complete in existence, excepting only that of Pyrard de Laval.\nIBN BAT\u00daTA\n\nIN\n\nTHE M\u00c1LDIVES AND CEYLON.*\n\nI resolved to go to the Dh\u00edbat Almahal (the M\u00e1ldives) of which I had heard much. Ten days after we had embarked at Calicut we arrived at the Dh\u00edbat Almahal islands. Dh\u00edbat is pronounced as the feminine of Dh\u00edb (Arabic for \"wolf\"; it is really an alteration of the Sanskrit douipa, \"island\"). These islands are among the wonders of the world: they number about 2,000.\u2020 A hundred or less of these islands lie together in a circle in the form of a ring: the group has an entrance as to a harbour, and ships get through by that alone. When a ship arrives near one of these islands it must of necessity have a pilot from among its natives, so that it may reach the other islands under his guidance. They are so close to each other that the tops of the palms which grow on one seem to belong to its neighbour.\u2021 If the vessel misses its way it cannot reach the islands, and is driven by the wind to Ma\u2019bar (coast of Coromandel) or towards Ceylon.\n\n* Voyages d'Ibn Batoutah, par C.

S., 1878, Vol. X. n. s., pp. 196\u20137, notes 2, 3; and \"The M\u00e1live Islands\" (Ceylon Sessional Papers, 1881), pp. 3, 4, 5, Notes (1) (6)\u2014B.\n\n\u2021 So too more recent travellers:\u2014\"The Malabares say that heretofore they were joyn\u2019d to the Continent, and were separated by the sea, which in some places hath left such narrow divisions that an active man might leap from one side to the other\" (Mandels\u00f8\u2019s Travels into the Indies, 1639. Lib. II. 116. London, 1662). \"But that which makes them so numerous is the multitude of canals that divide them; which are so narrow that the sprit-sails of the ships strike the leaves of the trees which are planted on both sides. And in some places a nimble man may leap into an island from the top of a bough that grows in another.\"\u2014(Collection of Voyages of the Dutch East-India Company, p. 131. London; 1703)\u2014B.\nAll the inhabitants of these islands are Musalm\u00e1ns, pious and honest people. They are divided into regions or zones, each of which is ruled by a governor called Cordouiy. Among these zones the following are distinguished: (1) the zone of P\u00e1lipour; (2) Cannal\u00f3us; (3) Mahal, the province after which all the islands are called, and at which their sovereigns reside; (4) T\u00e9ladib; (5) Caridou; (6) Teim; (7) H\u00e9l\u00e9domm\u00e9ty; (8) H\u00e9l\u00e9domm\u00e9ty, the name differing from the preceding only by having its first letter an h; (9) B\u00e9r\u00e9idou; (10) Candacal; (11) Molo\u00fac; (12) Souweid. The last is the most distant of all.* All the M\u00e1l-dive islands are destitute of grain, except that in the province\n\n* The French editors identify these names with those given by Pyrard as follows:\u2014\u201cP\u00e1lipour\u201d\u2014\u2018Padypolo\u2019; Mahal\u2014\u2018Mal\u00e9\u2019; Caridou\u2014\u2018Caridou\u2019; T\u00e9l\u00e9domm\u00e9ty\u2014\u2018Tilla dou matis\u2019; H\u00e9l\u00e9domm\u00e9ty\u2014\u2018Milla doue madoue\u2019; B\u00e9r\u00e9idou\u2014\u2018Poulisdous\u2019; Molo\u00fac\u2014\u2018Molucque\u2019; Souweid\u2014\u2018Souadou.\u2019 The Cannal\u00f3us of Ibn Bat\u00fata, they add, is perhaps the \u2018Collomadous\u2019 of Pyrard, or, as Horsburgh writes it, \u2018Colomandous.\n\n[\u201cThe majority of the above \u2018are easily recognisable,\u2019 but five (viz., Cannal\u00f3us, T\u00e9ladib, Teim, H\u00e9l\u00e9domm\u00e9ty, and Candacal) present more difficulty,\u2014some, indeed, being shaped, more Arabic, out of all but unsatisfactory conjectural recognition.\n\n\u201cAs regards H\u00e9l\u00e9domm\u00e9ty, the French translators would appear to be at fault. It may perhaps with more reason be taken as equivalent to Hela-du(m)-mati (S. hela, \u2018white,\u2019 or even sela, = Jav. sela, \u2018rock\u2019 + d\u00edva, \u2018island\u2019 + matu-pita, \u2018above\u2019) passing by contraction into Had-dummati. Add\u00fa may similarly be a contracted form of Hela-d\u00fa or Hulu-d\u00fa\u2014the name of one of the islands in that Atol.\n\n\u201cIf it be open to question the orthography of the MS. and, supposing an error of the copyist, read N\u00e9ladib for T\u00e9ladib\u2014t and n are not unlike in Arabic\u2014it can be at once fitted to Nilandu-Atol. Even accepting the received form as correct, the identification may possibly be not considered too far-fetched. Cf. Tojaree = ? Nausdri; Accanee and Kaluftee islands\u2019 (Lakkadive group) = Aucutta, Kalpeni. Adm. Chart. (Col. Yule in Indian Antiquary, Vol. III., pp. 212-4 on \u201cNames in the Tohfat-al Maj\u00e1hidin.\u201d)\u2026\u2026\n\n\u201cTo attempt to twist the rest into probable coincidence with the modern names of the remaining Atols seems hopeless. But the identification of Caridou with Caridou (Kaharid\u00fa)\u2014if accepted\u2014suggests a likely clue to their origin. Admitting that this island\u2014now-a-days of comparative insignificance,\nof Souweid there is a cereal like the anly (a kind of millet) which is brought thence to Mahal.* The food of the natives consists of a fish like the lyroun, which they call koulb alm\u00e2s. Its flesh is red: it has no grease, but its smell resembles that of mutton. When caught at the fishing, each fish is cut up into four pieces, and then slightly cooked: it is then placed in baskets of coco leaves and suspended in smoke. It is eaten when perfectly dry. From this country it is exported to India, China and Yaman. It is called koulb alm\u00e2s\u2020 (cobolly masse, i.e., \"black fish\" according to Pyrard, Part 1, p. 210, 214.)\n\n\u2014was of sufficient importance in the 14th century to be classed as a 'province', it is not improbable that other islands would have been taken as representative of whole groups or Atols.\n\n\"Tiladib, if not Nilandu, might then be Toddu, on the analogy of Had-dummati from H\u00e9ledomm\u00e9ty: Cannal\u00f4us\u2014Kinalos, 'Kenoorus,' Admiralty Chart, (M\u00e1losma\u1e0dulu Atol): Candacal\u2014Kedikolu, 'Kaindecolu,' Admiralty Chart, (Miladumma\u1e0dulu Atol.

The nature of the coconut is marvellous. One of these palms produces each year twelve crops, one a month. Some are small, others large: many are dry [yellow], the rest are green and remain always so. From the fruit is obtained milk, oil, and honey, as we have said in the first part of this book. With the honey is made pastry, which they eat with the dried coconut. All the food made from the coconut, and the fish eaten at the same time effect an extraordinary and unequalled vigor in manhood.\n\nAmong the remarkable trees of these islands are the tchoumo\u00fbn (Eugenia Jambu) the lemon, the lime and the colocasia. From the root of the last named, the natives prepare a flour with which they make a kind of vermicelli, and this they cook in coco milk; it is one of the most agreeable dishes in the world. I had a great taste for it and ate it often.*\n\nOf the Inhabitants of these Islands and some of their Customs: Description of their Dwellings.\n\nThe inhabitants of the Maldivian islands are honest and pious people, sincere in good faith and of a strong will: they eat only what is lawful, and their prayers are granted. When one of them meets another, he says \"God is my lord: Muhammad is my prophet: I am a poor ignorant being.\" In body they are weak and have no aptitude for combat or for war, and their arms\n\n* \"The island [M\u00e1l\u00e9] produces ......... a bulb in shape and appearance much resembling an ordinary potatoe, but having a pungent flavor. This the natives grate down, and steep in water for some time to deprive it of the unpleasant taste, and dry it afterwards, when it looks very much like flour, and is very palatable\" (Christopher and Young in Trans. Bombay, Geographical Society, 1836-38, p. 80). Without doubt the yam called by Maldivians hittala (Pyrrard, itelpoul, \"an edible root which grows in abundance, round and large as the two fists\") and probably identical with the hiritala (Dioscorea oppositifolia) of the Siphalese\u2014B.\nare prayers. One day in this country, I ordered the right hand of a robber to be cut off; upon which many of the natives in the hall of audience fainted away. The Indian pirates do not attack them, and cause them no alarm, for they have found that whoever takes anything of theirs is struck with a sudden calamity. When a hostile fleet comes to their shores, they seize what strangers they find, but do no harm to the natives. If an idolater appropriates anything, if it be but a lime, the chief of the idolaters punishes him and beats him severely, so much does he fear the results of such an action. Were it otherwise, certainly these people would be a most contemptible foe in the eyes of their enemies, because of the weakness of their bodies. In each of their islands there are fine mosques, and most of their buildings are of wood.\n\nThe islanders are good people: they abstain from what is foul, and most of them bathe twice a day, and properly too, on account of the extreme heat of the climate and the abundance of perspiration. They use a large quantity of scented oils, such as sandal-wood oil, &c., and they anoint themselves with musk from Makdachaou.* It is one of their customs, when they have said the morning prayer, for every woman to go to meet her husband or son with the collyrium box, rose-water and musk oil. He smears his eye-lashes with collyrium, and rubs himself with rose-water and musk oil, and so polishes the skin and removes from his face all trace of fatigue.\n\nThe clothing of these people consists of cloths. They wrap one round their loins in place of drawers, while on their backs they wear the stuffs called alouilyan \u2020 which resemble the ihr\u00e2m\n\n* Makdachaou:\u2014? Madagascar. [Rather Magadozo on the Zanzibar coast, which Ibn Batuta had visited (Tome II., 181.) \"After leaving Zaila we sailed on the sea for fifteen days, and arrived at Makdachaou an extremely large town.\"\u2014See Yule's Marco Polo.

The Mal-dive equivalent for the ihr\u00e2m is known as digu lib\u00e1s\u2014B.\n(clothes worn by the Musalm\u00e1ns during the pilgrimage). Some wear the turban, others supply its place with a little kerchief. When any one meets the K\u00e1dhi or the preacher, he takes his garment off his shoulders, and uncovers his back, and so accompanies the functionary till he arrives at his place of abode. Another of their customs is this\u2014when one of them marries, and goes to the house of his wife, she spreads cotton cloths from the house door to that of the (nuptial) chamber: on these cloths she places handfuls of cowries on the right and left of the path he has to follow, while she herself stands awaiting him at the door of the apartment. On his arrival she throws over his feet a cloth which his attendants take up. If it is the wife* who goes to the husband\u2019s house, that house is hung with cloths, and cowries are placed thereon: and the woman on her arrival throws the cloth over his feet. And this is also the custom of the islanders when they salute the sovereign, they must without fail be provided with a piece of cloth to cast down at the moment, as we shall hereafter describe.\n\nTheir buildings are of wood\u2020 and they take care to raise the floor of their houses some height above the ground, by way of precaution against damp, for the soil of their islands is damp. This is the method they adopt: they cut the stones, each of which is of two or three cubits long, and place them in piles then they lay across these beams of the coco-tree, and afterwards raise the walls with boards. In this work they show marvellous skill. In the vestibule of the house they construct an apartment which they call m\u00e1lem,\u2021 and there the master of the house\n\n* It appears from this passage that the two kinds of Sighalese marriage, b\u00edna and d\u00edga, were in vogue at the M\u00e1ldives. [Both forms are said to be recognised still\u2014B.\n\n\u2020 Even at the present day there is but one stone or brick built private house at M\u00e1l\u00e9 (Sultan\u2019s Island)\u2014B.\n\n\u2021 M\u00e1lem. \u201cA partition near the middle divides the house into two rooms, one of which is private, and the other open to all visitors.\u201d (Trans.

The public room is called b\u00e9ru-g\u00e9 and the private or women\u2019s apartment eteri-g\u00e9, or in the Southern Atols m\u00e1val-g\u00e9\u2014B.\nsits with his friends. This room has two doors, one opening on the vestibule by which strangers are introduced, the other on the side of the house by which the owner enters. Near the room in question is a jar full of water [?] and a bowl called ou\u00e9lendj* made of the coconut shell. It has a handle of [only] two cubits, wherewith to draw the water from the wells, by reason of their little depth.\n\nAll the inhabitants of the M\u00e1ldives, be they nobles or the common folk, keep their feet bare. The streets are swept and well kept: they are shaded by trees, and the passenger walks as it were in an orchard. Albeit every person who enters a house is obliged to wash his feet with water from the jar placed near the m\u00e2lem, and rub them with a coarse fabric of lif\u2020 (stipulae which envelope the base of the stalks of the date-palm leaves) placed there: after which he enters the house. Every person entering a mosque does the same. It is a custom of the natives when a vessel arrives for the can\u00e2dir (in the singular cundurah)\u2021 i.e., the little boats to go out to meet it, manned by the people of the island and bearing some betel and caranbah \u00a7 that is to say, green coconuts. Each presents some of these to whom he will of those on board the ship, and then becomes his host carrying to his own house the goods belonging to him, as if he were one of his near relations. Any one of the new-comers who wishes to marry, is at liberty to do so. When the time comes for his departure, he repudiates his wife, for the people of the M\u00e1ldives do not leave their country. As for a man who does not marry,\n\n* Ou\u00e9lendj:\u2014These cocoanut bowls with long handles (M. d\u00e2ni, but cf.: S. valanda \u201cchatty\u201d) are regularly used by the Islanders for drawing water.

In return she is contented to receive from him a very small present. The revenue of the treasury, which is called bender *(custom-house)* consists in the right of buying a certain portion of all cargo on board ship, at a fixed price, whether the commodity be worth just that or more: this is called the bender law. The bender has in each island a house of wood called b\u00e9djens\u00e2r where the governor, the cordou\u00e9ry, (above it is written cordo\u00fbiy)\u2020 collects all such goods: he sells or barter them. The natives buy with chickens any pottery which may be brought: a pot fetches five or six chickens.\n\nShips export from the islands the fish of which I have spoken, coconuts, fabrics, the ouliy\u00e2r and turbans: these last are of cotton. They export also vessels of copper, which are very common there, cowries\u2021 and kanlar\u00a7, such is the name of the\n\n* Bender:*\u2014See Pyrard, p. 231, \"bandery\": cf. Sin. ba\u1e47\u1e0dh\u0101ra. The system of raising revenue here described was still in force in Pyrard's day (Pyrard, chap. xvii.), and seems to be identical in principle with the 'culture system,' employed by the Dutch in Java, where it is supposed to have been invented by one of the Dutch governors subsequent to the English occupation. [Each Atol has its own storehouse (v\u00e1ru-g\u00e9) into which the revenues of the Sultan are received, and whence they are transferred from time to time to the Treasury (bodu ba\u1e0d\u00e9ri-ge, cf.: S. bh\u0101\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101g\u0101rika) at M\u00e1l\u00e9.\u2014B.]\n\n\u2020 Cordou\u00e9ry, cordotiy:\u2014\"The Atol-wari [Atolu-veri or V\u00e1r\u016b-veri; Pyrard 'varuery'] is a governor or chief of a division of islands called an Atol ......

The Rarhu-wari [Rarhu-veri] or headman of an island, stands in the same relation to the Atol-wari, as the latter does to the Hindeggeree, in respect to the revenue.\" (Trans. Bombay Geo.

The natives make it undergo a preparation in pits dug near the shore: then they beat it with picks, after which the women work it into rope. They make of it cord for joining the boards of their ships, and such cordage is exported to China, India and Yemen. Kanbar rope is worth more than hemp. With this cord the (boards of) ships are joined in India and Yemen, for the Indian sea is full of rocks, and if a ship joined with iron bolts strikes a rock, it is broken up: but when it is fastened with this cord it has elasticity, and does not break.\n\nThe money of the islanders consist of cowries. This is the name of a creature (a mollusc), collected in the sea and placed in pits dug out on the beach. Its flesh decays and there remains only the white shell. A hundred of these shells is called sy\u0101h, and 700, f\u0101l; 12,000 are called cotta, and 100,000 bost\u014d\u016b. Bargains are struck through the medium of these cowries, at the rate of four bost\u014d\u016b to a din\u0101r of gold. Often they are of less value, such as twelve bost\u014d\u016b to a din\u0101r.* The islanders sell them to the people of Bengal for rice, for they too use them for money. They are sold in the same way to the people of Yemen, who use them for ballast in their ships in place of sand. These cowries serve also as a medium of exchange with the negroes in their native country. I have seen them sold, at M\u0101ly and at Djoudjou, at the rate of 1,150 to a din\u0101r of gold.\u2020\n\n**The Women of the Maldives.**\n\nThe women of these islands do not cover the head: the sovereign herself does not so.

[Cowries are usually sold in the Islands by the hiya = 100, the f\u0101l\u0113 = 800 to 1,000, and the koff\u00e9 = 12,000 (b\u0101ra-f\u0101.)] A koff\u00e9 is not now worth more than Rs. 1 at M\u0101le.\u2014B.]\n\n\u2020 M\u0101ly; Djoudjou:\u2014Two places in the Soud\u00e1n, afterwards visited by the traveller.\nup on one side [of the head.] Most of them wear only a cloth, covering them from the navel to the ground: the rest of the body remains uncovered. In this costume they promenade the baz\u0101rs and elsewhere. While I was invested with the dignity of K\u00e1zi in these islands, I made efforts to put an end to this custom, and to compel the women to clothe themselves: but I could not succeed. No woman was admitted to my presence in the trial of a case, unless she had her whole body covered: but, saving that, I had no power over the usage.* Some women wear, besides the cloth, chemises with short and full sleeves. I had some young female slaves whose dress was the same as that of the women of Delhi. They covered the head: but that disfigured rather than embellished their appearance, as they were not used to it.\n\nThe ornaments of the M\u00e1l\u0111ive women consist of bracelets: each has a certain number on both arms, indeed, so that the whole of the arm from the wrist to the elbow is covered. These trinkets are of silver: only the wives of the Sultan and his nearest relatives wear bracelets of gold. The M\u00e1l\u0111ive women have also khalkh\u00e2l (anklets) called by them b\u00e2il, and collars of gold round the neck, called besdered.\u2020 One of their curious customs is to engage themselves as house servants, in consideration of a fixed sum, which does not exceed five pieces of gold. Their board is at the expense of those who hire them. They do not regard this as a disgrace, and most of the daughters of the inhabitants do it. You will find in the house of a rich man ten or twenty of them. The cost of all dishes broken by one of these maids is charged against her. When she wishes to go from one house to another, the masters of the latter give her the amount of her debt, this she remits to the people of the house she is\n\n* Pyrard, 3rd ed., pp. 82, 124, says that all women in his time carefully kept the breasts covered.

Most of the men say nothing about a nuptial gift, contenting themselves with declaring their profession of the Musalm\u00e1n faith, and a nuptial gift in conformity to the law is given. When ships arrive, those on board take wives, and repudiate them on their departure: it is a kind of temporary marriage. The M\u00e1l\u0111ive women never leave their country. I have never seen in the world women whose society is more agreeable. Among the islanders, the wife entrusts to no one the care of her husband\u2019s service: she it is who brings him his food, takes away when he has eaten, washes his hands, presents the water for his ablutions, and covers his feet when he wills to go asleep. It is one of their customs that the wife never eats with her husband, and that he does not know what his wife eats. I married in that country many wives: some ate with me at my request: others did not, and I could not succeed in seeing them take their food, and no ruse to get a sight was of any avail.\n\nThe story of the motive for the conversion of the inhabitants of these islands to Isl\u00e1m: Description of the evil spirits who wrought harm to them every month.\n\nTrustworthy men among the inhabitants, such as the\n\n* Regarding these servants (M. femus\u00e9ri), who are still employed, Mr. Gray (J.

They are generally well treated and fed; if not they are entitled to their freedom. \u2018Many a poor man voluntarily enters the service of some great lord as a pemousser\u00e9 to gain his protection and favour.\u2019 Christopher says that the men of Mal\u00e9 having to pay no taxes are very lazy and \u2018become dependents of any of the chiefs, most of whom retain as many followers as they may be able to support, a large retinue being a sign of rank and power.\u2019 Compare with this custom the growth of the feudal system in the West.\u201d\u2014B.\njuris-consult I\u00e7a Alyamany,* the juris-consult and schoolmaster 'Aly, the K\u00e1z\u00ed 'Abd Allah, and others, related to me that the population of the islands used to be idolaters, and that there appeared to them every month an evil spirit from among the Jinn, who came from the direction of the sea. He resembled a ship full of lamps. The custom of the natives, as soon as they perceived him, was to take a young virgin, to adorn her, and conduct her to a boudkh\u00e2nah,\u2020 i.e., an idol temple, which was built on the sea shore and had a window by which she was seen. They left her there during the night and returned in the morning; then they found the young girl dishonored and dead. They failed not every month to draw lots, and he upon whom the lot fell gave up his daughter. At length arrived among them a Maghribin\u2021 called Abou'lb\u00e9r\u00e9c\u00e2t, the Berber, who knew by heart the glorious Kur\u00e1n. He was lodged in the house of an old woman of the island Mahal. One day he visited his hostess and found that she had assembled her relatives, and that the women were weeping as if they were at a funeral. He questioned them upon the subject of their affliction, but they could not make him understand the cause. An interpreter coming in informed him that the lot had fallen upon the old woman and that she had one only daughter, who had to be slain by the evil Jinni. Abou'lb\u00e9r\u00e9c\u00e2t said to the woman:\n\n* I\u00e7a Alyamany:\u2014i.e.,? Is\u00e1 Falliy\u00e1 Maniku.

Christopher gives bu\u1e0d\u1e0du as the modern M\u00e1l\u0111ive for \"image\" (J. R.A.S., Vol. VI., o.s., p. 57). But the word bodd seems to have been a general term for an image with the Arab Oriental travellers, and may only indicate that the Buddhist parts of India were the first visited by the Arabs.\u2014Journ. As, 1845, p. 167. Ibn Bat\u00fata elsewhere says that the Jama Masjid of Delhi was built upon the sight of a former Boudkh\u00e2nah he does not therefore mean to imply that the word was M\u00e1l\u0111ive. [For some remarks on \"Buddhism at the M\u00e1l\u0111ives\" see Ceylon Sess.

He was conducted the night following to the idol temple after he had done his ablutions. There he set himself to recite the Kur\u00e1n, then by the window he perceived the demon, and continued his recitation. As soon as the Jinn\u00ed came within hearing of the Kur\u00e1n, he plunged into the sea; and when the dawn was come, the Maghrabin was still occupied in reciting the Kur\u00e1n. The old woman, her relatives and the people of the island came to take away the girl, according to their custom, and to burn the corpse. They found the stranger reciting the Kur\u00e1n, and conducted him to their King, by name Ch\u00e9no\u00fbr\u00e1zah,* whom they informed of this adventure. The King was astonished: the Maghrabin proposed to him to embrace Isl\u00e1m, and inspired him with a desire for it. Then said Ch\u00e9no\u00fbr\u00e1zah to him:\u2014\"Remain with us till next month, and if you do again as you have just done and escape the evil Jinn\u00ed, I will be converted.\" The stranger remained with the idolaters and God disposed the heart of the King to receive the true faith. He became Musalm\u00e1n before the end of the month, as well as his wives, children and court. At the beginning of the following month the Maghrabin was conducted to the idol-temple; but the demon came not, and the Berber recited the Kur\u00e1n till the morning, when the Sultan and his subjects arrived and found him so employed. Then they broke the idols, and razed the temple to the ground. The people of the island embraced Isl\u00e1m, and sent messengers to the other islands, whose inhabitants were also converted. The Maghrabin remained among them, and enjoyed their high esteem. The natives made profession of his doctrine, which was that of the Im\u00e1n M\u00e1l\u00edc. Even at present they respect the Maghrabins for his sake. He built a mosque, which is known by his name. I have also read the following inscription graven in wood on the enclosed pulpit of the\n\n* Ch\u00e9no\u00fbr\u00e1zah.\u2014Cf. S.

This share of the taxes still bears a name which recalls this event.\n\nOwing to the demon in question many of the M\u00e1l\u0111ive islands were depopulated before their conversion to Isl\u00e1m. When I reached the country I was not aware of this matter. One night, when I was at one of my occupations, I heard of a sudden people crying with loud voice the formul\u00e6, \"There is no God but God\" and \"God is very great.\" I saw children carrying Kur\u00e1ns on their heads, and women rapping the insides of basins and vessels of copper. I was astonished at their conduct and said \"What is happening\"? and they replied \"Do you not see the sea\"? Upon which I looked and saw a kind of large ship, seemingly full of lamps and chafing-dishes. They said to me \"that is the demon; he is wont to show himself once a month: but when once we have done as you have seen, he turns back and does us no harm.\"\n\nOf the Queen of these Islands.\n\nOne of the marvels of the M\u00e1ldives is that they have for their Sovereign a woman, by name Khadidjah, daughter of the Sultan Dj\u00e9l\u00e2l eddin \u2019Omar, son of the Sultan Sal\u00e2h eddin S\u00e2lih Albendj\u00e2ly. The kingdom had at one time been possessed by her grandfather, then by her father, and when the latter died, her brother, Chih\u00e1b eddin, became King. He was a minor, and the Vizier \u2019Abd Allah, son of Mohammed Alhadhramy\n\n* Vestiges of this romantic legend of their conversion to Muhammadanism live in the traditions of the Islanders to this day. But with more probability, they assign to a Shaikh Y\u00fasup Shams-ud-din of Tabrij the honour, which Ibn Bat\u00fata not unnaturally would claim for a Maghrabin, and the votaries of Hazrat Mir\u00e1 S\u00e9h\u00eeb for the N\u00e1g\u00farsaint (C.A.S. Journ., No. 24, pp. 125\u201336 1881). Their first royal convert to Isl\u00e1m the M\u00e1ldivians commonly know as \"Darumavanta (= S.

He is the same personage who married the Sultan Khadidjah after the death of her first husband, the Vizier Dj\u00e9m\u00e1l edd\u00edn, as we shall describe hereafter. When Chih\u00e1b edd\u00edn attained full age he ousted his step-father 'Abd Allah and banished him to the islands of Souweid. He was then left in sole possession, and chose as Vizier one of his freedmen by name 'Aly Oalaky,* whom he deposed at the end of three years and banished to Souweid. It is related of the Sultan Chih\u00e1b edd\u00edn that he consorted nightly with the wives of the public officers and with courtezans. On that account he was deposed and deported to the province of H\u00e9l\u00e9dout\u00e9ny (above spelt H\u00e9l\u00e9dommety): afterwards some one was sent and put him to death.\n\nThere then remained of the royal family only the sisters of the deceased, Kadidjah who was the eldest, Miryam and Fathimah. The natives raised Kadidjak to the throne, who was married to their preacher Dj\u00e9m\u00e1l edd\u00edn. The latter became Vizier and master of the situation\u2020 and promoted his son Mohammed to the office of Preacher in his own stead: but orders were promulgated only in the name of Khadidjah. These are traced on palm leaves by means of an iron [style] bent down resembling a knife. They write on paper only the Kur\u00e1ns and scientific treatises. The Preacher makes mention of the Sultan on Fridays and on other days [of public prayer]; and here are the terms used, \"O God, succour Thy servant, whom Thou hast in Thy wisdom preferred before other mortals, and whom Thou hast made the instrument of Thy mercy towards all Musalm\u00e1ns, namely, the Sultan Khadidjah daughter of Sultan Dj\u00e9l\u00e1l edd\u00edn, son of Sultan Sal\u00e1h edd\u00edn.\"\n\nWhen a stranger comes among these people and repairs to the hall of audience, which is called d\u00e1r,\u2021 custom requires that he\n\n* 'Aly Calaky:\u2014i.e., 'Ali Kal\u00e9ge.

He makes obeisance before the Sultana and throws down one of these cloths. Then he salutes her Vizier, who is also her husband, Dj\u00e9mal eddin, and throws down the other. The army of this Queen consists of about a thousand men of foreign birth; some of the soldiers are natives. They come every day to the hall of audience to salute her and then go home. Their pay is in rice, supplied to them at the bender (v. s., p. 10) every month. When the month is ended, they present themselves at the audience hall, and, saluting the Vizier, say, \"Convey our respects (to the Queen) and inform her that we have come to request our pay.\" Thereupon the necessary orders are given in their favour. The K\u00e1z\u00ed and ministers, who have with the people the title of Viziers, also present themselves every day at the audience hall. They make a salutation, and go away after the eunuchs have transmitted their respects to the Queen.\n\nOf the Ministers and their Conduct of Government.\n\nThe people of the M\u00e1ldives call the Grand Vizier, the Sultana's Lieutenant, Calaky*; and the K\u00e1z\u00ed Fandayark\u00e1lou.\u2020 All judgments are in the jurisdiction of the K\u00e1z\u00ed: he is more highly esteemed by the people than all other men, and his orders are executed as well as those of the Sultan and even better.

The lawyer 'Aly gave me a feast. He was a distinguished person and had sons addicted to study. I saw there a man named Mohammed a native of Zhaf\u00e4r Alhomou\u1e0dh, who entertained me and said to me, \"If you set foot on the island of Mahal, the Vizier will forcibly detain you, for the people have no Kazi.\" It was then my intention to get away from that country to Ma'bar (Coromandel coast), to Serendib (Ceylon), to Bengal, and then to China. I had then arrived at the Maldives in a ship whose captain was 'Omar Alhinaoury, who was one of the virtuous pilgrims. When we had come into harbour at Cannalo\u00fcs, he remained there ten days; then he hired a little barque to take him thence to Mahal, bearing a present for the Queen and her Consort. I wished to go with him, but he said, \"The barque is not big enough for you and your companions; if you like to set out without them, it is your affair.\" I declined this proposal, and 'Omar took his departure. But the wind was contrary (literally 'played with him') and at the end of four days he came back to us, not without having experienced trouble. He made his excuses to me, and implored me to go with him, my companions and all. We set sail in the morning and towards midday disembarked on an island: leaving that, we passed the night at another. After a four days cruise, we arrived at the province of Teim, the governor of which was one Hil\u0101l. He welcomed me, and gave me a feast: and afterwards came to visit me accompanied by four men, two of whom had on their shoulders a rod* from which were suspended four chickens. The other two had a similar rod to which were attached about ten coconuts. I was\n\natoll of the name Cannalo\u00fcs or one resembling it. It is unlikely too that Ibn Bat\u016bta coming from the north made his landing at a point so far south as Collomandu. The termination 'loue;' moreover or 'lu' seems in the modern names of the islands to be quite distinct from 'du.' [V. z., p. 5, for identification of this island with Kinatos in M\u0101losma\u1e0dulu Atol.

He received us with honour and entertained us. On the eighth day we put into an island belonging to a Vizier named T\u00e9lemdy. On the tenth, we at length reached the island of Mahal, where the Sultana and her Consort reside, and cast anchor in the harbour. It is a custom of the country that no one may disembark without the permission of the inhabitants.\u2020 This was accorded to us: and I then desired to betake myself to some mosque, but the slaves on the beach prevented me, saying, \"It is necessary that you should first visit the Vizier.\" I had requested the captain when he should be questioned about me to say, \"I know nothing of him\"; for fear lest they should detain me, being unaware that some ill-advised babbler had written to them an account of me, and that I had been K\u00e1z\u00ed at Delhi. On our arrival at the audience hall, we took our seats on benches at the third entrance door. The K\u00e1z\u00ed 'I\u00e7a Alyamany came up and welcomed me, while I saluted the Vizier. The ship captain Ibr\u00e2h\u00eem (above he is called 'Omar) brought ten pieces of worked stuffs, made a salute before the Queen, and threw down one of them: then he bent the knee in honor of the Vizier and threw down another, and so on to the last. He was questioned about me, and replied, \"I know nothing of him.\"\n\nWe were then presented with betel and rose-water which is a mark of honor with them. The Vizier gave us lodging in a house and sent us a repast consisting of a large bowl full of rice and surrounded with plates of salted meats dried in the sun, chickens, melted butter and fish. On the morrow I set out with the captain and the K\u00e1z\u00ed, 'I\u00e7a Alyamany to visit a hermitage\n\n* The Sinhalese penumkada or pingo of presents of sweetmeats, provisions, fruits, &c.\n\n\u2020 Enforced to this day\u2014B.\nsituated at the extremity of the island and founded by the virtuous Shaikh Nedjib.* We returned at night, and on the following morning the Vizier sent me some raiment, and a repast comprising rice, melted butter, salt, sun-dried meat, coconuts, and honey extracted from the same fruit, called by the natives korb\u00e1nya,\u2020 signifying 'sugar-water.' They brought me also 100,000 cowries for my expenses. After ten days there arrived a ship from Ceylon, having on board some Persian and Arab fak\u00edrs who knew me and told the servants of the Vizier all about me. This enhanced the pleasure given by my coming. He sent for me at the commencement of Ramaz\u00e1n. I found the Chiefs and Viziers already assembled: food was served at the tables, each of which accommodated a certain number of guests. The Grand Vizier made me sit by his side, in company of the K\u00e1z\u00ed \u2019Iq\u00e1, the F\u00e1medd\u00e1r Vizier or Chief of the Treasury, and the Vizier \u2019Omar, the D\u00e9herd,\u2021 i.e., General of the army. The dinner of these islanders consists of rice, chickens, melted butter, fish, salt, sun-dried meat, and cooked bananas. After eating, they drink the coco honey mingled with aromatics, which facilitates digestion.\n\nOn the 9th of Ramaz\u00e1n, the son-in-law of the Vizier died. His wife, the daughter of that minister, had already been married to the Sultan Chih\u00e1b eddin: but neither of her husbands had cohabited with her on account of her youth. Her father, the\n\n* This old shrine (Najibu miskitu), it is said, may still be seen at M\u00e1l\u00e9.\u2014B.\n\n\u2020 Korb\u00e1nya:\u2014Probably ought to be \u2018hakorb\u00e1nya\u2019 equivalent to the Sinhalese hakuru, \u2018jaggery\u2019: peni, \u2018honey,\u2019 the former word appearing as acowrou for \u2018coco-honey\u2019 in the vocabulary of Pyrard.\n\n\u2021 D\u00e9herd:\u2014Cf.

I asked permission to entertain the fakirs returning from visiting the Foot of Adam, in the island of Ceylon (see below). This he granted, and sent me five sheep, a rare animal with the islanders, having to be brought from Ma'bar (Coromandel Coast) from Malabar and from Makdachaou. The Vizier sent me also rice, chickens, melted butter and spices. I had all these carried to the house of the Vizier Souleim\u00e1n, the M\u00e2ndyec (Admiral), who took the greatest care in having them cooked, augmented them in quantity, and sent me carpets and copper vessels. We broke the fast according to custom, in the palace of the Sultana, with the Grand Vizier, and I requested him to permit some of the other Viziers to assist at my dinner. He said \"I will come myself too.\" I thanked him and returned home: but he had already arrived with the Viziers and grandees of the State. He seated himself in a raised pavilion of wood. All who came, whether Chiefs or Viziers, saluted the Grand Vizier, and threw down a piece of unworked stuff, in such numbers that the total reached to a hundred or thereabouts, all of which the fakirs appropriated. Dinner was then served and eaten: then the readers of the Kur\u00e1n gave a reading with their fine voices, after which were singing and dancing. I had a fire prepared, and the fakirs then entered and trampled it under foot; some of them even ate the live embers, as one would devour sweetmeats, until the flame was extinguished.\n\nThe Story of Some of the Vizier's Bene-\nfactions to Me.\n\nWhen the night was ended, the Vizier went home and I accompanied him. We passed a garden belonging to the Treasury, and the Vizier said to me, \"This garden is for you: I will have a house built upon it to serve for your residence.\" I praised his kind action, and made vows in his favour. Next day he sent me a young female slave, and his messenger said, \"The Vizier bids me say, if this girl pleases you, she is yours: otherwise he will\nsend a Mahratta slave.\" I liked the young Mahratta girls, so I replied \"I desire only the Mahratta,\" The minister had one brought to me, by name Gulistan, which signifies \"the flower of the garden\" (or more exactly 'the parterre of flowers'). She knew the Persian tongue, and pleased me highly. The Maldivian inhabitants have a language which I did not understand.\n\nThe next day, the Vizier sent me a young female slave from Coromandel by name Anbery (ambergris colour). On the following evening he came to my house with some of his servants, and entered attended by two little [boy] slaves. I saluted him, and he asked me how I did. I made vows for his welfare and thanked him. One of the slaves put before him a lokchah (bokchah),* that is, a kind of napkin, from which he drew some silk stuffs and a box containing pearls and trinkets. The Vizier made me a present of them, adding, \"If I had sent these with the young slave, she would have said 'This is my property: I brought it from the house of my master.' Now that the things belong to you, make her a present of them.\" I addressed prayers to God for the minister, and rendered to him expressions of my gratitude, of which he was worthy.\n\nOf the Vizier's change of disposition towards me; of the project which I formed to depart; and of my continued sojourn at the Maldives.\n\nThe Vizier Souleim\u00e2n, the M\u00e2n\u00e2yec, had proposed to me to espouse his daughter. I sent to ask the permission of the Vizier Dj\u00e9m\u00e2l eddin to conclude the marriage. My messenger returned saying, \"It does not please him; he wishes you to marry his daughter when the legal term of her widowhood shall have expired.\" I refused to consent to this union, fearing the sinister fortune attached to the daughter of the Vizier, since two husbands had already died without having consummated the marriage. In the midst of all this a fever seized me, and I was very ill.\n\n* Lokchah or bokchah:\u2014If the latter be the correct reading = ? burugt the cloth worn over the face at times by Maldivian ladies.\u2014B.\nEvery person who goes to that island must inevitably catch the fever.* I made a strong resolve to get out of the country: I sold a portion of my trinkets for cowries, and chartered a ship to take me to Bengal. When I went to take my leave of the Vizier, the K\u00e1z\u00ed coming out met me, and addressed me in these terms, \"The Vizier,\" said he, \"bids me tell you this 'If you wish to go away, give us back what we have given you and then go.'\" I replied, \"With a part of my trinkets I have bought cowries; do with them what you will.\" In a little while the K\u00e1z\u00ed returned to me and said, \"The Vizier says 'We have given you gold, not cowries,'\" I replied, \"Very well: I will sell them and will pay you gold.\" Accordingly I sent to request the merchants to buy the shells from me. But the Vizier gave them orders not to deal with me; for his design, in so conducting himself, was to prevent me going away from him.\n\nThen he deputed one of his intimates, who had this conversation with me, \"The Vizier bids me request you to remain with us and you shall have everything you desire.\" So I said to myself, \"I am under their authority: if I do not stay with a good grace, I shall have to stay by constraint: a voluntary sojourn is preferable to that.\" I therefore made reply to the envoy, \"Very well: I shall remain with him.\" The messenger returned to his master, who was delighted with my reply, and sent for me. When I entered his presence, he got up and embraced me, saying, \"We wish you to remain with us, and you wish to go!\" I made my excuses, which were accepted, and said, \"If you wish me to stay, I will impose upon you certain conditions.\" The Vizier replied, \"We accept them: please to name them.\" I answered, \"I am unable to walk on foot.\" For it is a custom of the country that\n\n* \"On la connoist par toute l' Inde sous le nom de fi\u00e8vre des Maldives. Ils l'appellent Mal\u00e9 ons [hun or huma]. C'est de cette maladie que la pluspart de mes compagnons estoient morts, comme tous estrangers ne manquent pas d'en estre bientost atteints,\" (Pyrard, p. 95; again p. 201). The Indian Navy Surveyors (1834\u20136) suffered much from this pest of the group.\u2014B.\nno one rides on horseback, except the Vizier. So it was that when I had a horse* given to me and was mounted, the crowd of men, as well as children, began to follow me with astonishment, whereof I complained to the Vizier. Accordingly a donkorah was beaten, and it was proclaimed among the people that no one should follow me. The donkorah is a kind of copper basin, which is struck with an iron rod [or hammer], and gives a noise heard afar.\u2020 After it is struck, the crier cries in public whatever he required.\n\nThe Vizier said to me, \"If you wish to ride in a palaquin, well and good: otherwise we have a stallion and a mare: choose which of these animals you prefer.\" I chose the mare which was brought to me at once. At the same time some garments were brought to me. I said to the Vizier, \"What shall I do with the cowries which I have bought?\" He replied, \"Send one of your companions to sell them for you in Bengal.\" \"I will do so,\" said I, \"on condition that you send someone to help him in the affair.\" \"I will,\" he replied. So I despatched my comrade Abou Mohammed, son of Ferh\u00e1n, in whose company they sent one called the pilgrim 'Aly. But it happened that a storm arose: the crew jettisoned the whole cargo, including even the mast, the water, and all the other provisions for the voyage. They remained for sixteen days without sail, rudder, &c.; and after the endurance of hunger, thirst, and toil, they arrived at the island of Ceylon. In a year's time my comrade Abou Mohammed came back to me. He had visited the Foot (of Adam) and he afterwards saw it again with me.\n\nACCOUNT OF THE FESTIVAL IN WHICH I TOOK PART WITH THE ISLANDERS.\n\nThe month of Ramaz\u00e1n ended, the Vizier sent me some [proper] raiment, and we made our way to the place consecrated\n\n* In November, 1879, there were but two horses in the Islands, the property of the Sultan at M\u00e1l\u00e9, \"wretched wry-legged weeds, not fit to ride,\" and kept merely for show.\u2014B.\n\n\u2020 Donkorah:\u2014Ibn Bat\u00fata's ignorance of the M\u00e1ldivian language may possibly have led him to confuse dumm\u00e1rihi, the term for the 'flagiolet,' with k\u00f3li 'gong.' The iron striker is called dadiga\u1e0du.\u2014B.\nfor prayer. The path which the minister had to traverse, between his residence and the place of prayer, had been decorated: stuffs had been spread, and there had been placed to right and left heaps (literally cotta's, v. s., p. 11) of cowries. All the Emirs and grandees who had houses on the road had planted near them little coco-trees, arecas, and bananas. Ropes were hung from one tree to the next, and green nuts were suspended from the ropes. The master of the house remained near the gate, and when the Vizier passed, he threw before his feet a piece of silk or cotton. The slaves of the minister appropriated these, as well as the cowries placed by the way. The Vizier advanced on foot, covered with an ample robe of goat's hair of Egyptian manufacture, and with a large turban. As a scarf he wore a kerchief of silk; four umbrellas shaded his head, and sandals covered his feet. All his attendants without exception had their feet bare. Trumpets, clarions, and drums* preceded him: the soldiers marched before and behind him, all shouting the cry \"God is very great!\" until they were arrived at the place of prayer.\n\nPrayer ended, the son of the Vizier preached: then was brought a litter which the Vizier mounted. The Emirs and the other grandees again saluted him, casting down pieces of stuffs according to custom. Before this time the Grand Vizier used not to ride in a litter, for the Kings alone did so. The bearers then lifted it; I mounted my horse, and we entered the palace. The minister seated himself at a raised dais, having near him the Viziers and the Emirs. The slaves remained standing, bearing shields, swords, and staves.\u2020 Food was then served, and afterwards arecanuts and betel, after which was brought a little dish containing sandal mokassiry.\u2021 As soon as one party of the guests\n\n* M. talafli; dummdrhi; beru.\u2014B.\n\u2020 M. addana; kadis; daqiq.\u2014B.\n\u2021 Mokassiry: =?

That day I saw upon one of their dishes a fish of the species of sardines, salted and raw, which had been sent as a present from Caoulem. This fish is very abundant on the Malabar Coast. The Vizier took a sardine, and began to eat it, at the same time saying to me, \"Eat some of that; it is not found in our country.\" I answered, \"How can I eat it? It is not cooked.\" \"It is cooked,\" said he. But I replied, \"I know this fish well, for it abounds in my native land.\"\n\nOF MY MARRIAGE AND OF MY NOMINATION TO THE DIGNITY OF K\u00c1ZI.\n\nOn the 10th day of Shaww\u00e1l I agreed with the Vizier Souleim\u00e1n M\u00e1n\u00e1yec, or Admiral, that I should espouse his daughter, and I sent to request the Vizier Dj\u00e9m\u00e1l edd\u00edn that the betrothal should take place in his presence at the palace. He agreed and sent betel, according to custom, and sandal. The people were present for the ceremony. The Vizier Souleim\u00e1n delayed his coming. He was sent for; and yet he came not. He was sent for a second time, and he excused himself on account of the illness of his daughter: but the Grand Vizier said to me in private, \"His daughter refuses to marry; and she is mistress of her own actions. But see! the people are assembled: would you like to espouse the step-mother of the Sultana, the widow of her father?\" (The Grand Vizier's son was then married to this woman's daughter). I replied \"Yes, by all means.\" He then convoked the K\u00e1z\u00ed and the notaries. The profession of the Musalm\u00e1n faith was then recited, and the Vizier paid the dowry. After some days my wife was brought to me. She was one of the best women who ever lived. Such was her good manners, that when I became her husband, she anointed me with scented oils and perfumed my clothes; during this operation she laughed and allowed nothing disagreeable to be seen.\n\nWhen I had married this lady, the Vizier constrained me to accept the functions of the K\u00e1z\u00ed. The cause of my nomina-\ntion was that I had reproached the K\u00e1z\u00ed for taking the tenth part of inheritances, when he made partition among the heirs. I said to him, \"You ought to have only a fee, which you should agree for with the heirs.\" This judge did nothing rightly. After I was invested with the dignity of K\u00e1z\u00ed, I used all my efforts to have the precepts of the law observed. Disputes are not settled in that country as in ours. The first bad custom which I reformed concerned the sojourn of divorced women at the houses of those who had repudiated them; for these women did not cease to remain at the houses of their former husbands, until they got married to others. I prevented this being done under any pretext. About five and twenty men were brought to me who had conducted themselves in this sort. I had them beaten with whips,* and had them marched through the baz\u00e1rs. As for the women, I compelled them to leave the homes of these men. Next I exerted myself to get prayers celebrated: I ordered some men to run down the streets and baz\u00e1rs immediately after the Friday's prayers. If any were discovered, who had not prayed, I had him beaten and marched through the town. I compelled the Im\u00e2ms and Mouezzins in possession of fixed appointments to apply themselves assiduously in their duties. I wrote in the same sense to (the magistrates of) all the other islands. Lastly I essayed to make the women dress themselves, but in this I did not succeed.\n\nOf the Arrival of the Vizier 'Abd Allah, Son of Mohammed Alhadhramy Whom Sultan Chihab Eddin Had Banished to Souweid: Account of What Passed Between Us.\n\nI had espoused the step-daughter of this personage, and I loved this wife very dearly. When the Grand Vizier recalled him to the Island of Mahal, I sent him presents, went to meet\n\n* M. durr\u00e1. Pyrard has gleau \"leathern thongs used for corporal punishment.\"\u2014B.\nhim, and accompanied him to the palace. He saluted the Grand Vizier, who lodged him in a magnificent house, and there I often visited him. It happened, when I passed the month of Ramaz\u00e1n in prayer, that all the inhabitants visited me, except 'Abd-Allah. The Vizier Dj\u00e9m\u00e1l eddin himself came to see me, and 'Abd-Allah with him, but only bearing him company. Enmity arose between us. Afterwards when I came out of my retreat, the maternal uncles of my wife, the step-daughter of 'Abd-Allah made a complaint to me. They were the sons of the Vizier Dj\u00e9m\u00e1l eddin Assindjary. Their father had appointed the Vizier 'Abd-Allah to be their guardian, and their property was still in his hands, although they had by the law emerged from wardship. They demanded his appearance in Court. It was my custom when I summoned one of the contending parties to send him a slip of paper, either with or without writing. On delivery of that the party repaired to the Court; if he did not, I punished him. In this way I sent a slip to 'Abd-Allah. This procedure raised his choler, and on account thereof he conceived a hatred for me. He concealed his enmity and sent some one to plead for him. Some unseemly language was reported to me as having been used by him.\n\nThe islanders, both gentle and simple, were accustomed to salute the Vizier 'Abd-Allah in the same way as the Vizier Dj\u00e9m\u00e1l eddin. Their salutation consists in touching the ground with the forefinger, then kissing it, and placing it on the head. I issued orders to the public crier, and he proclaimed in the Queen's palace in the presence of witnesses, that whoever should render homage to 'Abd-Allah in like manner as to the Grand Vizier should incur severe chastisement. And I exacted from him a promise that he would not allow men to do so. His enmity against me was now increased. Meantime I married another wife, daughter of a highly esteemed Vizier, whose grandfather was the Sultan D\u00e1oud, the grand-son of the Sultan\nAhmed Ch\u00e9nodr\u00e2zah.* Then I married one who had been married to the Sultan Chih\u00e2b eddin, and I had three houses built in the garden which the Vizier gave to me. My fourth wife, the step-daughter of 'Abd-Allah, lived at her own house. She was the one of all my wives whom I cherished the most. Thus allied by marriage to the persons named, the Vizier and the people of the island feared me much, by reason of their own weakness. False reports were spread between me and the Grand Vizier, in great part by the care of the Vizier 'Abd-Allah, so that our estrangement became final.\n\nOF MY DEPARTURE FROM THESE PEOPLE, AND OF THE MOTIVE THEREOF.\n\nIt happened that one day the wife of a slave of the late Sultan Djel\u00e2l eddin made a complaint of him to the Vizier, to the effect that he had a liaison with one of the Sultan's concubines. The Vizier sent witnesses, who entered the girl's house and found the slave asleep with her upon the same carpet. Both were taken into custody. In the morning, on being informed of this, I went to the audience hall and took my seat in my customary place. I made no reference to the affair. A courtier then approached me and said, \"The Vizier requests to know if you have any business with him.\" I replied, \"No.\" The design of the minister was that I should speak of the affair of the concubine and the slave; for it was my invariable rule to decide every case which he put before me. But as I was showing him my dissatisfaction and dislike, I omitted to do so then. I went straightway to my own house and took my seat where I delivered my judgments. Soon after came a Vizier, saying on behalf of the Grand Vizier, \"Yesterday, so and so occurred in\n\n* This relationship fixes approximately the date of Ch\u00e9nodr\u00e2zah and of the Muhammedan conversion, which may have been as early as 1200 A.D., but\u2014allowing for early marriages\u2014perhaps more probably about 1220, or 1230 A.D.\u2014See Paper on the Maldives, J.R.A.S., Vol. X., N., s., 1878., p. 177.\nthe matter of the concubine and slave: judge both of them conformably with the law.\" I replied, \"It is a cause in which it is not fitting to deliver judgment save at the Sultan's palace.\" I then returned thither: the people assembled, and the concubine and the slave were summoned. I ordered that both should be beaten for their liaison; and adjudged that the woman should be set at liberty and the slave kept in prison: after which I returned home.\n\nThe Vizier sent several of his principal attendants to speak to me about setting the slave at liberty. I said to them, \"Intercession is made with me in favor of a negro slave, who has violated the respect which he owed to his master; while but yesterday, you have deposed the Sultan Chih\u00e1b eddin and slain him, because he went into the house of one of his slaves.\" Thereupon I ordered the prisoner to be beaten with bambu switches, which produced more effect than the whip. I had him marched through the whole island, with a rope round his neck. The messengers of the Vizier went and informed him of what passed. He discovered great agitation and was inflamed with anger. He assembled the other Viziers, the chiefs of the army, and sent for me. I obeyed the summons. It was my custom to pay him homage by bending the knee. This time I did not do so, only saying \"Peace be with you!\"* Then I said to those present, \"Be ye witnesses that I resign my functions as K\u00e1z\u00ed, because I am rendered powerless to exercise them.\" The Vizier having then bespoken me, I went up and took a seat in front of him, and then I answered him in terms yet more severe. After this rencontre, the Mouezzin made the call to prayer at sun-down, and the Grand Vizier entered his house, saying, \"It is pretended that I am a sovereign; but see! I have sent for this man in order to vent my wrath upon him, and he dares to be angry with me.\" I was only respected by these islanders for the sake of the Sultan of India, for they knew the position I occupied under\n\n*Salaam alecon!\u2014Ar.\nhim. Although they are far removed from him, they fear him much in their hearts.\n\nWhen the Grand Vizier had returned to his house, he sent the deposed K\u00e1zi, an eloquent speaker, who addressed me as follows:\u2014\"Our master requires to know why you have violated, in the presence of witnesses, the respect which is due to him, and why you have not rendered him homage?\" I replied, \"I saluted him only when my heart was satisfied with him; but now that dissatisfaction has supervened, I have renounced the usage. The salutation of Musalm\u00e1ns consists only of the word ass\u00e9l\u00e1m, (Peace be with you!) and that I have pronounced.\" The Vizier sent this person a second time, and he then said, \"You have no other aim but that of leaving us; pay the dowries of your wives, and what you owe to the men, and go when you will.\" At this speech I bowed and went to my house and paid such debts as I had contracted. Up to this time the Vizier had given me carpets and a suite of furniture, consisting of copper vessels, and other things. He used to grant me everything I asked; he loved me and treated me with consideration; but his disposition changed and he became inspired with fear of me.\n\nWhen he heard that I had paid my debts and that I was intending to depart, he repented of what he had said, and put off granting me permission to go. I adjured him by the strongest oaths that I was under necessity to resume my voyage. I removed my belongings to a mosque upon the beach, and repudiated one of my wives. Another was with child, to her I gave a term of nine months, within which I might return, or in default thereof she was to be mistress of her own actions. I took with me that one of my wives who had been married to the Sultan Chih\u00e1b eddin in order to restore her to her father who dwelt in the island of Molo\u00fac, and my first wife, whose daughter was half-sister to the Sultana. I agreed with the Vizier 'Omar Deherd (or General of the army, v. s. p. 22) and the Vizier\nHa\u00e7an, the Admiral, that I should go to the country of Ma'bar* (Coromandel), the king of which was my brother-in-law, and that I should return with troops, to the end that the islands might be reduced under his authority, and that I should then exercise the power in his name. I chose to serve as signals between us, white flags to be hoisted on board the vessels. As soon as they should see these, they were to rise in rebellion on shore. I never had any such idea, up to the day when I showed my displeasure. The Vizier was afraid of me and said to the people, \"This man is determined to get the Vizierate, me living or dead.\" He made many enquiries about me, and added, \"I have heard that the King of India has sent him money, to use in raising trouble against me.\" He dreaded my departure lest I should return from the Coromandel Coast with troops. He bade me remain until he should get a ship ready for me: but I refused.\n\nThe half-sister of the Queen complained to her of the departure of her mother with me. The Queen wished to prevent her, but did not succeed. When she saw her resolved to go, she said to her, \"All the trinkets you possess were provided with money from the custom-house. If you have witnesses to swear that Dj\u00e9l\u00e1l eddin gave them to you, good and well; otherwise restore them.\" These trinkets were of considerable value; nevertheless my wife gave them up to these people. The Viziers and Chiefs came to me while I was at the mosque, and prayed me to return. I replied to them, \"Had I not sworn, assuredly I would return.\" They said, \"Go then to some other island, so that your oath be kept, and then return.\" \"Very well,\" said I, to satisfy them. When the day of my departure\n\n* The name Ma'bar ('passage' or 'ferry') was given to the Coromandel coast by the Arabs during the 13th and 14th centuries. Col. Yule suggests that it referred to the communication with Ceylon, or, as is more probable, to its being at that age the coast most frequented by travellers from Arabia and the Gulf (Marco Polo II., p. 268). The tract of coast called Ma'bar extended from Cape Comorin to Nellore.\nwas come, I went to bid adieu to the Vizier. He embraced me and wept in such wise that his tears fell upon my feet. He passed the following night watching in the island, for fear lest my connections by marriage and my comrades should rise in rebellion against him.\n\nAt length I got away and arrived at the island of the Vizier 'Aly. My wife was in great distress, and wished to return. I repudiated her and left her there, and wrote this news to the Vizier, for she was the mother of his son's wife. I repudiated also the wife to whom I had fixed the term (for my return) and sent for a slave girl I was fond of. Meanwhile we sailed through the midst of the islands, from one group to another.\n\nOf Women who have only One Breast.\n\nIn one of the islands I saw a woman who had only one breast. She was mother of two daughters, of whom one resembled her exactly, and the other had two breasts, only that one was large and full of milk, the other small and contained none. I was astonished at the conformation of these women.\n\nWe arrived in course at another of these islands which was small, and had a solitary house, occupied by a weaver,* a married man and father of a family. He possessed small coco trees, and a little barque,\u2020 which served him for fishing and visiting the other islands when he wished: on his islet were also small bananas trees. We saw there none of the birds of the continent, except two crows, which flew in front of us on our arrival and circled round our ship. I truly envied the lot of this man, and made a vow that if his island should belong to me, I would retire to it until the inevitable term should arrive for me.\n\n* Mats, and some cloths, are woven in Huvad\u00fa (Suv\u00e1div\u00e9) Atol; the former on the islands Gadd\u00fa, Havara Tinad\u00fa, and Gemand\u00e1-furhi.\u2014B.\n\n\u2020 M. mas odi.\u2014B.\nI next arrived at the island of Molo\u00fbc,* where I found the ship belonging to the captain Ibr\u00e2h\u00eem in which I had resolved to sail to the Coromandel Coast. That person came to visit me along with his companions, and they entertained me at a fine feast. The Vizier had written in my favor an order requiring them to give me at this island 120 bost\u00fb (v. s. p. 11) of cowries, 20 goblets of athou\u00e2n\u2020 or coco-honey, and to add to that every day a certain quantity of betel, arecanuts, and fish. I remained at Molo\u00fbc 70 days, and married two wives there. Molo\u00fbc is one of the fairest islands to see, being verdant and fertile. Among other marvellous things to be seen there, I remarked that a branch cut off one of the trees there, and planted in the ground or on a wall, will cover itself with leaves and become itself a tree. I observed also that the pomegranate tree there ceases not to bear fruit the whole year round. The inhabitants of this island were afraid that the captain Ibr\u00e2h\u00eem was going to harry them at his departure. They therefore wanted to seize the arms which his ship contained, and to keep them until the day of his departure. A dispute arose on this subject, and we returned to Mahal, but did not disembark. I wrote to the Vizier informing him of what had taken place. He sent a written order to the effect that there was no ground for seizing the arms of the crew. We then returned to Molo\u00fbc, and left it again in the middle of the month of Rab\u00ee the second of the year 745 (26th August A.D. 1344). In the month of Shab\u00e1n of the same year (December, 1344), died the Vizier Dj\u00e9m\u00e2l eddin. The Sultana was with child by him and was delivered after his death. The Vizier 'Abd-Allah took her to wife.\n\n* Molo\u00fbc:\u2014Moluk, the chief island of Moluk Atol, is in lat. 2\u00b0 57' N. The Admiralty Chart says that it possesses good water. [More probably Fu\u00e2 Mulaku Island, which lies detached a little S.E. of the centre of the Equatorial Channel (lat. 0\u00b0 17', S.) between Huvad\u00fb and Add\u00fb Atols. Ibn Bat\u00fbta had already \"sailed through the midst of the islands, from one group to another.\"\u2014B.]\n\n\u2020 Athou\u00e2n:\u2014Above at p. 22 coco-honey is called korb\u00e2ny. In Moura's edition of Ibn Bat\u00fbta (Lisbon, 1855), the word appears as alatuan.\nAs for us, we sailed on, though without an experienced pilot. The distance which separates the Maldives from the Coromandel Coast is three days' sail. We were for nine days under sail, and on the 9th we went on shore at the island of Ceylon. We perceived the mountain of Serendib raised in the air like a column of smoke. When we came near the island, the mariners said, \"This port is not in the country of a Sultan in whose dominions the merchants can go in all safety; it is in the country of the Sultan Airy Chacarouaty* who is one of the unjust and perverse. He has ships engaged in piracy on the high seas.\" Wherefore we feared to land at his port, but, the wind rising, we were in danger of being swamped, and I said to the Captain, \"Put me ashore and I will get for you a safe-conduct from this Sultan.\" He did as I requested, and put me out on the beach. The idolaters advanced to meet us and said, \"Who are you?\" I apprized them that I was the brother-in-law and friend of the Sultan of Coromandel, that I was on my way to pay him a visit, and that what was on board the ship was destined for a present to that prince. The natives went to their Sovereign and communicated to him my reply. He sent for me, and I presented myself before him at the town of Bathalak (Puttalam)\u2020 which was his capital.\n\n* Airy Chacarouaty.\u2014This seems to be the (?) P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0diyan prince, \"Aareya Chakkra Warti,\" mentioned in Pr\u012bdham (Ceylon, Vol I., p. 78), who, after 1371 A.D., conquered the northern half of the Island, and took King Wikrama captive, but was defeated by the Adigar Alakeswara, and possibly the same Malabar Prince captured and put to death by Prince \"Sapoomal Cumara.\"\u2014See Upham's Rajawali, p.264, 269. [A correspondent writes:\u2014\"The name identifies no individual. All the Kings of Jaffna seem to have been called Ariya or Ariyan\u2014an old title in India. See the Khandagiri rock inscription, and one of those over the Manikpura cave at Udayagiri (Cunningham's Corpus Insc. Indic., Vol. I.) Jaffna at this period (A.D. 1344) was, if the Vaipasa Malai can be trusted, under the rule of Kunavirasinha Ariyan.\"\u2014B.]\n\n\u2020 Bathalak.\u2014This town has been identified with Puttalam by Lee, Tennent, the French Editor, and Col. Yule, successively; but, it seems to me, without sufficient authority. The \u0101 of Bathalak is against it; so too the want\na neat little place, surrounded by a wall and bastions of wood. All the neighbouring shore was covered with trunks of cinnamon trees, torn up by the torrents. This wood was collected on the beach, and formed as it were hillocks. The inhabitants of Coromandel and of Malabar take it away without payment, save only that in return for this favor they make a present to the Sultan of\n\nof corroborative evidence of the existence of Puttalam as a town of any importance at this period, and the want of any river in its neighbourhood answering to the \"torrents\" spoken of by the traveller. This last point, and the doubtful existence of cinnamon so far north as Puttalam, are the only difficulties raised by Tennent (Vol. I., p. 580). The site of Batth\u0101l\u0101h has to be found with a full consideration of the cinnamon question, and, of the site of M\u00e9n\u0101r Mendely, the town at which Ibn Bat\u016bta: first halts on his journey towards the Peak. With his usual laborious care Tennent (Vol. I., p. 596) has examined all the early authorities known to him, and concludes that the text here gives the first mention of cinnamon as a product of Ceylon. Col. Yule, however (Marco Polo, Vol. II., p. 255), points out that two previous notices of it exist, one in Kazwini (circa A.D. 1275), the other in a letter from John of Montecorvino (Ethel's Kazwini, 229; Cathay, 213.)\n\nThe account given by our traveller shews that it was not as yet cultivated, and perhaps that the \"trunks\" seen by him were not those of the valuable variety of later days, but of the common indigenous cassia. I am not aware whether the cultivation, or growth, of cinnamon positively ceases at Chilaw, as seems to be the common opinion: but, even if this be true of the Ceylon cinnamon of commerce, it may not be so of the indigenous plant, and the area of production may be more limited now than in the 4th century. Ribeyro (Lee's edn., p. 15), says \"there is a forest of it 12 leagues in extent between Chilaw and the pagoda of Tenevary,\" without saying that Chilaw is the northern limit: the French translator (at p. 11) in his note, remarks 'that it is only found between Grudumal\u00e9 and Tenevar\u00e9.' Now the promontory of Kutiraimalai is a considerable distance north of Puttalam: and I have little doubt that the French translator had good authority for the assertion. The remaining difficulty, that of the \"torrents,\" inclines me to believe that the site of Batth\u0101l\u0101h was probably further north, near the mouth of the Kal\u0101-oya, where the free access to the sea by the passage between Kalipi\u1e6diya and K\u0101rat\u012bvu would seem to designate a more suitable situation for a Prince, whose strength lay in ships.\n\nIt now remains to fix M\u00e9n\u0101r Mendely, which has been identified by preceding commentators, and not unnaturally, with the Minneri Mundal of\nstuffs and such things. Between Coromandel and the island of Ceylon there is a distance of a day and a night. There is also found in this island plenty of brazil-wood,* as well as Indian aloes, called alcalakhy (perhaps from the Greek \u03b1\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\u2020), but which does not resemble the kam\u00e1ry or the k\u00e1kouly.\u2021 We shall speak of them hereafter.\n\nOF THE SULTAN OF CEYLON.\n\nHe is called Airy Chacarouaty, and he is a powerful King upon the sea. I saw in one day, while I was on the Coromandel\n\nArrowsmith's map, adopted by Tennent. This place is represented as upon the Calpentyn [Kalpitiya] peninsular, due west of Puttal\u00e1m, and I could never account for the traveller taking it on his route to the Peak. I am now informed that no such place exists. There is, however, on the present road, about half way between Puttal\u00e1m and Chilaw, a village called Muntal or Mundal, four miles north of the Battul-oya, which seems to me to suit the description of the traveller in every way. M\u00e9n\u00e1r Mendely was the frontier town of the Batth\u00e1lah Prince, as Bender S\u00e9ldou\u00e1t (Chilaw) must (from the term Bender) have been to the Sinhalese King of the South: and the low jungles of the neighbourhood have always been a favourite haunt of wild buffaloes. By the Census of 1871, I find Mundal and T\u00e1ndivila together had a population of 128, and Paniya Muntal, a neighbouring village, of 80. In conclusion, I have to state that the correspondent who has indicated the places on the Peak route, is of opinion that Batth\u00e1lah is Jaffna and M\u00e9n\u00e1r Mendely, Mann\u00e1r. I have been unable, after due consideration, to adopt his views, nor could* I state them here at sufficient length. I trust, however, that if he has no objection he will formulate them in a separate paper for the use of the Society.\n\n* Brazil-wood.\u2014i.e., \"sapan.\" \"'They have brazil-wood, much the best in the world.' Kazwini names it, and Ribeyro (Lee's edn., p. 16) does the like.\" \u2014Yule, Marco Polo, Vol. II., pp. 254, 256.\n\n\u2020 Alcalakhy.\u2014Mr. L. Nell considers the surmise of the French editors correct. \"Ibn Bat\u00fata evidently uses the Greek term agallokon corresponding to the Latin Excaecaria agallocha.

There were in the port eight ships belonging to the Sultan of the country and destined to make the voyage to Yemen. The sovereign gave orders to make preparations, and assembled people to guard his vessels. When the Sinhalese despaired of finding an opportunity of seizing them, they said, \"We have only come to protect the vessels belonging to us, which also must go to Yemen.\"\n\nWhen I entered the presence of the idolater Sultan, he rose, and made me sit by his side, and spoke to me with the greatest good-will. \"Let your comrades,\" said he, \"land in all safety, and be my guests until they leave. There is an alliance between me and the Sultan of Coromandel.\" Then he gave orders to have me lodged, and I remained with him for three days, in great consideration, which increased every day. He understood the Persian tongue, and much did he relish all I told him of foreign Kings and countries. I entered his presence one day when he had by him a quantity of pearls, which had been brought from the fishery in his dominions. The servants of the prince were sorting the precious from those which were not so. He said to me, \"Have you seen the pearl fishery in the countries whence you have come?\" \"Yes,\" I answered; \"I have seen it in the island of Keis, and in that of Kech, which belong to Ibn Assaou\u00e2m\u00e9ly.\" \"I have heard of them,\" replied he; and then took up some pearls and added, \"Are there at that island any pearls equal to these?\" I said, \"I have seen none so good.\" My answer pleased him, and he said, \"They are yours: do not blush,\" added he, \"and ask of me anything you desire.\" I replied, \"I have no other desire, since I have arrived in this island, but to visit the illustrious Foot of Adam.\" The people of the country call the first man b\u00e2bd (father) and Eve, m\u00e2m\u00e2 (mother). \"That is easy enough,\" answered he, \"We shall send some one to conduct you.\" \"That is what I wish,\"\nsaid I, and then added, \"The vessel in which I have come will go in safety to Ma'bar and on my return, you will send me in your ships.\" \"By all means\" said he.\n\nWhen I reported this to the Captain of the ship, he said, \"I will not go till you have returned, even though I should have to wait a year for you.\" I made known this answer to the Sultan, and he said, \"The Captain shall be my guest until your return.\" He gave me a palanquin, which his slaves bore upon their backs, and sent with me four of those djoguis who are accustomed to undertake the pilgrimage annually to the Foot; he added to the party three Br\u00e4hmins, ten others of his friends, and fifteen men to carry the provisions. As for water, it is found in abundance on the route.\n\nOn the day of our departure, we encamped near a river, which we crossed in a ferry-boat formed of bamboos. Thence we took our way to M\u00e9n\u00e1r Mendely, a fine town, situated at the extremity of the Sultan's territory, the people of which treated us to an excellent repast. This consisted of young buffaloes, taken in chase in the neighbouring forest and brought in alive, rice, melted butter, fish, chickens and milk. We did not see in this town a single Musalm\u00e1n, except a native of Khorassan, who had remained on account of sickness, and who now accompanied us. We left for Bender Sel\u00e2ou\u00e2t,* a little town, and after quitting it we traversed some rough country, much of it under water. There were numbers of elephants there, which do no manner of harm to pilgrims, nor to strangers, and that is by the holy influence of Shaikh Abou 'Abd Allah, son of Khafif, the first who opened this way to visiting the Foot. Up to that time the infidels prevented the Musalm\u00e1ns from accomplishing the pilgrimage,\n\n* Bender Sel\u00e2ou\u00e2t, i.e., Chilaw.\u2014The fact that it was called Bender, implies, I think, that it contained a custom-house or store-house (V. s. p. 10), and was a frontier town of the King who ruled south of \"Aareya Chakrawarti.\" This is confirmed by the description of M\u00e9n\u00e1r Mendely as the frontier town of \"Aareya Chakrawarti.\"\nharried them, and would not eat or deal with them. But when\nthe adventure, which we have recounted in the first part of these\nVoyages (Tome II, pp. 80, 81) had happened to the Shaikh Abou\n'Abd Allah, that is to say, the murder of all his companions by\nthe elephants, his own preservation, and the manner in which the\nelephant carried him on its back, from that time on the idolaters\nhave respected the Musalmans, have permitted them to enter\ntheir houses and to eat with them.* They also place confidence\nin them, as regards their women and children. Even to this\nday they venerate in the highest degree the above-named Shaikh,\nand call him 'the Great Shaikh.'\n\nMeanwhile we reached the town of Conac\u00e1r,\u2020 the residence\n\n* \"In this statement Ibn Bat\u00fbta is fully borne out by Robert Knox, who\nsays, speaking of the charity of the Sighalese, in his Chapter 'concerning\ntheir religious doctrines, opinions, and practices,' Part iii., Ch. 5, 'Nor are\nthey charitable only to the poor of their own nation; but, as I said, to others\nand particularly to the Moorish beggars, who are Mahometans by religion;\nthese have a temple in Kandy. A certain former King gave this temple this\nprivilege\u2014that every freeholder should contribute a ponnam (fanam, 1\u00bdd.) to it;\nand these Moors go to every house in the land to receive it [except in\nDolosb\u00e2g\u00e2]; and, if the house be shut, they have power to break it open, and\ntake of goods to the value of it. They come very confidently when they beg,\nand say they come to fulfil the peoples' charity; and the people do liberally re-\nlieve them for charity's sake...... These Moors pilgrims have many pieces of\nland given to them by well disposed persons, out of charity, where they build\nhouses and live; and this land becomes theirs from generation to generation for\never.\" (Skeen, Adam's Peak, p. 285.)\u2014B.\n\n\u2020 Conac\u00e1r\u2014Dr. Lee identifies this place with Gampola, and he is followed\nby Pridham and Tennent. According to Turnour's Epitome, Gampola did not\nbecome the capital till after 1347, while Ibn Bat\u00fbta is writing of the end of\n1344. The Sighalese monarchy was then in a very troublous condition, and\nit is difficult to decide upon the locality of Conac\u00e1r.\u2014[Skeen (Adam's Peak,\np. 286) hesitates between Gampola and Ratnapura, the place where gems are\nchiefly found.] Col. Yule (Cathay, p. 423, Note) suggests that it was Kurun\u00e7gala.\n\n[Mr. L. Nell writes:\u2014\"Sir Emerson Tennent did not hesitate to identify\nthis Sovereign with Bhuwan\u00e9ka B\u00e1hu IV., whose capital was Ganga\u015bripura, the\nmodern Gampola. This identification was based on the Chronological Table of\nof the principal Sovereign of the Island. It is built in a gully, between two mountains, near a great vale, called 'the vale of precious stones,'* because gems are found in it. Outside this town is seen the Mosque of the Shaikh Othman of Shiraz, surnamed Ch\u00e2ouich (the usher). The King and inhabitants of the place visit him, and treat him with high consideration. He used\n\nTurnour; but there are two grounds to doubt this identification. In the first place Turnour admitted an anachronism about A.D. 1347, the date assumed for the accession of Bhuvan\u00e9ka B\u00e1hu IV, because the terms of three reigns immediately preceding this Sovereign are not given. Secondly, the capital of Kin\u00e1r or Kondr is described as situate in a valley between two hills in a 'vale' (or according to Lee 'bay') in which gems were found. The term Conac\u00e1r, sounds like an Arab attempt to reproduce the name Kurun\u00e9gala. Ibn Bat\u00fata wrote in A.D. 1344; according to Turnour, Gampola did not become the capital till after A.D. 1347. We are thus thrown back to a period before the accession of Bhuvan\u00e9ka B\u00e1hu IV. There is an old native route between Puttal\u00e1m and Kurun\u00e9gala. The route from Puttal\u00e1m to Gampola direct has not been known.\" The correspondent already quoted notes:\u2014\"In tracing the traveller beyond Chilaw reference is necessary to Ceylon history. Incomparably the best authority for this period is the Nik\u00e1ya Sangraha, which was composed about 1396 A.D. (Turnour states 1357 A.D., but that is manifestly wrong, as the author describes all the Kings up to Bhuvanaika B\u00e1hu V., who came to the throne 1914 A.B., showing Turnour's date to be wrong by 7 years): the corresponding portion of the Mah\u00e1caos was written in 1758 A.D., and is not of anything like the same authority.\n\n\"The King of Sighalese Ceylon in 1344 A.D. was Bhuvanaika B\u00e1hu IV. He ascended the throne 1342 A.D., and did not move the seat of Government to Gampola from Kurun\u00e9gala until 1346 A.D. Consequently Conac\u00e1r must be (as indeed one would expect from the sound) Ibn Bat\u00fata's way of rendering Kurun\u00e9gala. It lies 'between two mountains,' the Handrukkanda range and the Yakdessa range.\"\u2014B.]\n\n* \"The valley of the Mah\u00e1-oya which is within 10 miles of Kurun\u00e9gala. The word 'Manikam' used by the traveller (Lee's version) occurs in two villages in this valley Menik-divela and Menik-kadawara. The valley was celebrated for precious stones (see Kadaim pota), and the latter was a place of some notoriety in the 16th century, and figures in Tennent's Portuguese map as Manicavare: it is near Polgahawela.\"\u2014B.\nto serve as a guide for those who go to see the Foot. When he had his hand and foot cut off, his sons and slaves became guides in his stead. The cause of his being so mutilated was that he killed a cow. Now the law of the Hind\u00fas ordains that one who has killed a cow should be massacred in like wise, or enclosed in its skin and burnt. The Shaikh 'Othm\u00e2n being respected by those people, they contented themselves with cutting off his hand and foot, and granted to him, as a present, the dues levied at a certain market.\n\nOf the Sultan of Conac\u00e2r.\n\nHe is called by the name Con\u00e2r,* and possesses the white elephant. I have never seen in the world another white elephant. The King rides him on solemn occasions, and attaches to the forehead of this animal large jewels. It happened to this Monarch that the nobles of his empire rebelled against him, blinded him, and made his son King. As for him, he still lives in this town, deprived of his sight.\n\n* Con\u00e2r\u2014According to Turnour's list of Siphalese monarchs, the King at this time, 1344-45, would be Wijaya B\u00e1hu the Vth. Col. Yule (Cathay, p. 423 Note) thinks Con\u00e2r or Kun\u00e2r is the Sanskrit Kum\u00e2var, 'prince.'\n\n[\"Col. Yule's guess\" adds Mr. Nell \"at the name of the Sovereign 'Con\u00e2r,' as identical with 'Kum\u00e2var,' the Sanskrit for 'Prince,' comes near what I conceive to be the fact. It will be seen that the Arab traveller describes a Mahommedan Mosque, outside the town of this Prince. Now, a Mahommedan Prince, Vasthimi Kum\u00e2ray\u00e2, did reign with great popularity in Kurun\u00e9gala. His romantic story is a local tradition in that town. He is said to have been treacherously murdered by the Buddhist priests of a temple on Et\u00e1gala. They invited him to be present at a religious ceremony and suddenly pushed him over the precipice [Pridham, Vol. II., p. 649]. Offerings are made upon a mound on the road to the M\u00e1l\u00edg\u00e1wa, which probably marks the spot where the Prince was interred, or the Shaikh referred to hereafter. No native will venture to pass the spot after dark without company, for the spirit of Gala-Band\u00e2ra, on horseback, is supposed to ride about the neighbourhood. The Court is said to have been immediately removed to Dambadeniya after this assassination, on the ground that the sanctity of the city had been polluted by a Mahommedan usurper.]\nOF THE PRECIOUS STONES.\n\nThe admirable gems called albahram\u00e1n (rubies or carbuncles) are only found at this town. Some of them are found in the vale and these are the most precious in the eyes of the natives; others are extracted from the earth. Gems are met with in all localities in the island of Ceylon. In this country the whole of the soil is private property. An individual buys a portion of it, and digs to find gems. He comes across stones white-branched: in the interior of these stones the gem is hidden. The owner sends it to the lapidaries, who scrape it until it is separated from the stones which conceal it. There are the red (rubies), the yellow (topazes), and the blue (sapphires) which they call neilem (n\u00eelem).* It is a rule of the natives that precious stones whose value amounts to 100 fanams are reserved for the Sultan, who gives their price and takes them for himself. As for those of an inferior price, they remain the property of the finders.\u2020 One hundred fanams are equivalent to six pieces of gold.\n\nIt is probable that the priest, who compiled the history referred to by Turnour, has purposely omitted the name of this Kum\u00e1ray\u00e1, thus causing the anachronism noticed by Turnour. C\u00e1sie Chetty conjectures that this Prince was the son of Wijaya B\u00e1hu V. by his Moorish Queen Vasthimi and this is quite consistent with the above theory. It is also stated by Ibn Bat\u00fata that the King and inhabitants of Conac\u00e1r used to visit the Mahomedan Shaikh Othm\u00e1n of Shiraz at his Mosque, and to treat him with great respect. It is significant that the Prince of Conac\u00e1r is not mentioned in the French translation as 'an infidel King', as Ibn Bat\u00fata seems to be careful to do in all instances of those who were not his co-religionist. The French translation also describes this King as deposed by his subjects and deprived of his sight, whilst his son was placed on the throne. This son may have been Vasthimi Kum\u00e1ray\u00e1. The silence of the Sighalese historians has, however, left all this in doubt.\"\u2014B.]\n\n* Neilem = S. nila.\n\n\u2020 Barbosa on the other hand says that all the Ceylon gemming is done by the agents of the King, and on his behalf. The stones are brought to him, and his lapidaries select the best, and sell the rest to the merchants (Stanley's\nAll the women in the island of Ceylon possess necklaces of precious stones of divers colors: they wear them also at their hands and feet, in the form of bracelets and khalkh\u00e1ls (anklets). The concubines of the Sultan make a network of gems and wear it on their heads. I have seen on the forehead of the white elephant seven of these precious stones, each of which was larger than a hen's egg. I likewise saw in possession of Airy Chacarouaty a ruby dish, as large as the palm of the hand, containing oil of aloes. I expressed my astonishment at this dish, but the Sultan said, \"We have objects of the same material larger than that.\"\n\nWe left Conac\u00e1r, and halted at a cave called by the name of Ostha Mahmoud Allouzy. This person was one of the best of men; he had excavated this cave in the mountain side, near a little vale. Quitting this place, we encamped near the vale called Khaour bouzneh ('monkey vale'). Bouzneh (Persian bo\u00fbzineh) designates the same as alkoroud (plural of alkird, 'monkey') in Arabic.\n\nOf the Monkeys.\n\nThese animals are very numerous in the mountains: they are of a black colour, and have long tails. Those of the male sex have beards like men. The Shaikh 'Othm\u00e1n, his son and other persons, have related to me that the monkeys have a Chief whom they obey like a Sovereign. He binds round his head a wreath of the leaves of trees, and supports himself with a staff. Four\n\nBarbosa, Hakt. Soc., p. 169.) Ludovico di Varthema (A.D. 1505) says:\u2014\"And when a merchant wishes to find these jewels, he is obliged first to speak to the King, and to purchase a braza of the said land in every direction (which braza is called a molan [? amupam], and to purchase it for five ducats. And then when he digs the said land, a man always remains there on the part of the King, and if any jewel be found there which exceeds ten carats, the King claims it for himself and leaves all the rest free.\"\u2014Badger's Varthema, Hakt. Soc., p. 190.\n\n* See further, as to the wonderful gems of that period, Marco Polo, Bk. III., Ch. xiv., and Col. Yule's note thereto.\nmonkeys, bearing staves, march on his right and left, and, when the chief is seated, they stand behind him. His wife and little ones come and sit before him every day. The other monkeys come and squat at some distance from him: then one of the four above-mentioned gives them the word and they withdraw; after which, each brings a banana, or a lime, or some such fruit. The King of the monkeys, his little ones, and the four chief monkeys then eat. A certain djogui related to me that he had seen these four monkeys before their Chief, occupied in beating another monkey with a stick, after which they plucked his hair.*\n\nTrustworthy persons have reported to me that when one of these monkeys has got possession of a young girl, she is unable to escape his lust. An inhabitant of the island of Ceylon has told me that he had a monkey, and when one of his daughters entered the house, the animal followed her. She cried him off, but he did her violence. \"We ran to her aid,\" continued the speaker, \"and seeing the monkey embracing her, we killed him.\"\n\nThen we took our departure for 'the vale of bamboos,'\u2020 where Abou 'Abd Allah, son of Khafif, found two rubies, which he\n\n* \"This is evidently a confused account of the Veddas and their customs. Ibn Batuta was now in their country, Sabaragamuwa, through which he was journeying, being, as its name imports, 'the Vedda village.'\" (Skeen, loc. cit., p. 289). See C.A.S. Journ., Vol. VII., Pt. II., No. 24, 1881, p. 107.\u2014B.\n\n\u2020 \"Passing through the forest, and cresting several hills that rose each higher than the one behind we came to Ali-h\u00e1ntenne, [Ali-h\u00e9n-t\u00e9na] a tract of dense canes or batali, crossed in all directions by numerous elephant tracks. This was evidently one of the favourite feeding grounds of that monarch of the forest, as the name it bore plainly enough indicated. Beyond this is an extensive marsh, thickly covered with large reeds,\u2014'the estuary of reeds' of Ibn Bat\u00fata, [Lee's version]\u2014a swampy district, not at all pleasant to pass at any season, wet or dry, owing to the swarms of leeches that infest it: and further on is Batapola....

It lives upon trees and herbs in the neighbourhood of water, and when a man approaches, it pounces upon him.

The natives take care to have ready in that case a lime, the juice of which they express over\n\n* \"A steep and rough ascent, for a considerable distance from Batapola,\u2014midway in which a stone tumulus has been erected on the spot where the remains of an old priest were burned\u2014brings the pilgrim to Palabaddala, 'the house of the old woman,' according to Ibn Bat\u00fata, and 'the farthest inhabited part of the island of Ceylon' [Lee's version], that is, when he travelled through it, about five hundred and thirty years ago. * * * *\n\n\"The following legend is connected with the place, and accounts for its name:\u2014Long, long ago, a very poor woman was desirous of performing the pilgrimage to the Sri-p\u00e1da, but, owing to her extreme poverty, could take nothing with her except some common jungle leaves, which in times of distress the natives occasionally resort to for food; these she boiled, and rolled up in a plaintain leaf; and having arrived thus far, when about to partake of her food, she found the boiled leaves had been miraculously turned into rice. Thenceforward it was called Pali-bat-dola, 'the place [rill] of rice and vegetables,' a name which it has ever since retained.\" (Skeen, loc., cit. p. 147, 154-5.)\u2014B.\n\n\u2020 \"An ascent of some fifty feet brings the pilgrim to the crest of the ridge of which the Dharmma-r\u00e1ja-gala forms a part.

It is said that a certain pilgrim was passing this neighbourhood, and that the leeches fastened upon him. He remained impassive, and did not squeeze lime-juice upon them: and so all his blood was sucked and he died.* The name of this man was B\u00e2b\u00e2 Khouzy, and there is there a cave which bears his name. From this place we took our way to 'the seven caves,' then to 'the hill of Iskandar' (Alexander). There is there a grotto called of Alisfah\u00e2ny, a spring of water, and an uninhabited mansion, beneath which is the bay called 'the place of bathing of the contemplative.' At the same place is seen 'the orange cave' and 'the cave of the Sultan.' Near the latter is the gateway (derw\u00e2zeh in Persian, b\u00e2b in Arabic) of the mountain.\u2020\n\n* Dr. Lee has this note:\u2014\"Knox describes these leeches as being rather troublesome than dangerous. His words are:\u2014\u2018There is a sort of leaches of the nature of ours, only differing in colour and bigness; for they are of a dark reddish colour like the skin of bacon, and as big as a goose-quill; in length some two or three inches. At first, when they are young, they are no bigger than a horse-hair, so that they can scarce be seen. In dry weather none of them appear, but immediately upon the fall of rains, the grass and woods are full of them. These leaches seize upon the legs of travellers......Some, therefore, will tie a piece of lemon and salt in a rag, and fasten it unto a stick, and ever and anon strike it upon their legs to make the leaches drop off: others will scrape them off with a reed, cut flat and sharp in the fashion of a knife,' &c.\u2014Ceylon, p. 25.

About fifty or sixty feet below, he saw a clearing in a small dell, in the centre of which was a square kind of tank; and this dell he determined to examine on the occasion of his third visit. The result of the examination was, that he identified the station H\u00e9ramitip\u00e2na, and this place, as that described by Ibn Bat\u00fbta, as 'the ridge of Alexander, in which\nOf the Mountain of Serendib (Adam's Peak).\n\nIt is one of the highest mountains in the world: we saw it from the open sea, when we were distant from it upwards of nine days' march. While we were making the ascent, we saw the clouds above us, hiding from view the lower parts of it. There are upon this mountain many trees of kinds which do not cast their leaves, flowers of divers colors, and a red rose as large as the palm of the hand.* It is alleged that on this rose is an inscription in which one may read the name of God Most High and that of his Prophet.\u2020 On the mountain are two paths leading to the Foot of Adam. The one is known by the name of\n\nis a cave and a well of water,* at the entrance to the mountain Serendib. The old Moor's account is somewhat confused, his notes or recollections not always carrying his facts exactly in their due order; but half way down the descent, on the left hand, is a well, excavated in the rock, in which we found about five feet of water, and which swarmed with tadpoles. Possibly Ibn Bat\u00fata found it in the same condition, for he speaks of the well, at the entrance, full of fish, of which 'no one takes any.' At the bottom of the dell is a cleared space; in the centre of this is a square tank or well, the sides of which are formed of blocks of stone, six or eight feet long. Beyond this, almost facing the descent, some twenty feet up the opposite mountain's side, is a cave. To this my companion and I forced our way through the jungle, and came to the conclusion that this was the cave of Kh\u00edzr, where, Ibn Bat\u00fata says, 'the pilgrims leave their provisions, and whatever else they have, and then ascend about two miles to the top of the mountain, to the place of (Adam's) foot.' In the preceding sentence he says, 'Near this (cave) and on each side of the path, is a cistern cut in the rock.' Now, no other place that we saw, or heard of\u2014and we were particularly minute in our inquiries\u2014answers to such a description. There are the two wells, and the cave; and the distance to the foot-print is also pretty fairly estimated.\" (Skeen, loc. cit., pp. 226-7.)\u2014B.\n\n* \"Gigantic rhododendrons overhang the wall on the eastern side of the Peak. Their bending trunks seem, to the Buddhist mind, to bow to the foot-print; and to offer, in homage and adoration, their wealth of crowning crimson flowers to the pedal impress of the founder of their faith.\" (Skeen, loc. cit., p. 200.)\u2014B.\n\n\u2020The pious Musalm\u00e1ns in this age of faith found their creed proclaimed by nature itself not only on the flowers of the rhododendron, but on the leaves\n'the Father's path' and the other by that of 'the Mother's path. By these terms are Adam and Eve designated. The Mother's route is an easy one, and by it the pilgrims return; but any one who took it for the ascent would be regarded as not having done the pilgrimage. The Father's path is rough and difficult of ascent. At the foot of the mountain, at the place of the gateway, is a grotto also bearing the name of Iskandar, and a spring of water.\n\nof the fig-tree. Before he went to the M\u00e1ldives, Ibn Bat\u00fata was at Deh Fattan (? D\u00e9vipatam), a town on the Malabar Coast, where he records the existence of an extraordinary tree near the mosque. \"I saw that the mosque was situated, near a verdant and beautiful tree; whose leaves resembled those of the fig, except that they were glossy. It was surrounded by a wall and had near it a niche or oratory, where I made a prayer of two genuflexions. The name of this tree with the natives of the country was derakht (dirakht) acch\u00e9h\u00e1dah 'the tree of the testimony.' I was informed at this place that every year, on the arrival of autumn, there fell from this tree a solitary leaf, whose colour passed first to yellow and then to red. On this leaf were written, with the pen of the Divine power, the words following 'There is no God but God, and Mohammed is the apostle of God.' The juris-consult Hou\u00e7ain and many other trustworthy men told me that they had seen this leaf, and had read the inscription upon it. Hou\u00e7ain added that, when the time arrived for it to fall, trusted men from among the Musalm\u00e1ns and the idolaters sat down under the tree. When the leaf fell the Musalm\u00e1ns took one half of it, while the other was deposited in the treasury of the idolater Sultan. The inhabitants preserve it for the purpose of curing the sick. This tree caused the conversion of the grandfather of Coueil [the Sultan at the time of his visit] to the faith, and he it was who built the mosque and the tank [from its description similar to the Sinhalese pokuna]. This prince could read the Arabic characters: and when he deciphered the inscription and understood what it contained, he embraced the true faith and professed it entirely. His story is preserved in tradition among the Hind\u00fas. The juris-consult Hou\u00e7ain told me that one of the children of this King returned to idolatry after the death of his father, governed with injustice, and ordered the tree to be torn up from the roots. The order was executed, and no vestige of the tree was left. Nevertheless it 'began to shoot again, and became as fair a tree as it had been before. As for the idolater, he came to die full soon thereafter.\" (Tome IV., pp. 85-87.) I have quoted this passage\nThe people of old have cut in the rock steps of a kind, by help of which you ascend; fixed into them are iron stanchions, to which are suspended chains, so that one making the ascent can hold on to them.* These chains are ten in number, thus:\u2014two at the foot of the mountain [Peak] at the place of the gate-way; seven in contiguity after the two first; and the tenth, that is \u2018the chain of the profession of faith (Isl\u00e1m),\u2019 so named because a person who has reached it and looks back at the foot of the mountain will be seized with hallucinations, and, for fear of falling, he will recite the words \u201cI bear witness that there is no God but God, and that Muhammad is his prophet.\u201d When you have passed this chain, you will find a path badly kept. From the tenth chain to \u201cthe cave of Khidhr\u201d\u2020 is seven miles. This cave is situate at an open place, and it has near it a spring of water full of fish, and this also bears the name of Khidhr. No one may catch these fish. Near the cave are two basins cut in the rock, one on each\n\nat length as an illustration of the habit of missionary religions to annex and adapt the shrines and idols of local worship. The fig-tree in question was, I have little doubt, a b\u00f4 tree, surrounded by a wall and altars like the Mah\u00e1 Vih\u00e1r\u00e1 at Anur\u00e1dhapura. It is likely to have been credited with healing powers, and so to have preserved its influence in the locality from the decay of Buddhism in Malabar, through the centuries of Br\u00e1hmanish reaction, until at length the followers of the Prophet contrived by means of the fancied inscription to control the superstitious faith of its devotees. The similar attempt of the Muhammadans to annex the \u015ar\u00ee-p\u00e1da of Samanala, by claiming it as the foot-print of Adam, has done nothing towards the conversion of the Sighalese. The Hind\u00fas claim it as that of \u015aiva or Vish\u1e47u, according to their sect. (Skeen\u2019s Adam\u2019s Peak, p. 27.)\n\n* These chains are spoken of by Marco Polo in the previous century. \u201cFurthermore you must know that on this Island of Seilan there is an exceeding high mountain; it rises right up so steep and precipitous that no one could ascend it, were it not that they have taken and fixed to it several great massive iron chains, so disposed that by help of these men are able to mount to the top.\u201d\u2014Yule, Marco Polo, Vol. II., p. 256.\n\n\u2020 See, as to the identity of this saint or prophet, Dr. Lee\u2019s note, and Sell, \u2018Faith of Isl\u00e1m,\u2019 p. 260.\u2014B.\nside of the path. In the grotto of Khidhr the pilgrims leave their belongings; thence they mount two miles further to the summit, where is the Foot.\n\n**Description of the Foot.**\n\nThe impression of the noble Foot, that of our father Adam, is observed in a black and lofty rock, in an open space. The Foot is sunk in the stone, in such wise that its site is quite depressed; its length is eleven spans.* The inhabitants of China came here formerly; they have cut out of the stone the mark of the great toe, and of that next to it, and have deposited this fragment in a temple of the town of Zettoun (Tseu-thoung) whither men repair from the most distant provinces.\u2020 In the rock whereon is the print of the foot, are cut nine holes, in which the holater pilgrims place gold, precious stones and pearls. You may see the fakirs, arrived from 'the grotto of Khidhr' seeking to get ahead of one another, and so to see what may be in these holes. In our case we found there only some little stones, and a\n\n* Dr. Marshall, who in 1819 ascended the Peak with Mr. S. Sawers, says the foot is 5 ft. 6 in. in length. Tennent says it is \"about 5 feet long, and of proportionate breadth\" (Vol. II. p. 140), Knox (p. 3) says \"about two feet long,\" but he never saw it. Ribeyro, Liv. i., C. xxiii., says, \"two palms long and eight inches broad.\" See further Yule's Marco Polo, Vol. II., p. 261. Lieut. Malcolm, the first Englishman who made the ascent, (1815), says the impression is in kablook or ironstone. [\"The heel is much higher than the toes, and the artificiality of the whole is palpable. A thick raised edging of cement marks the rude outline of a foot 5 ft. 7 in. long, and 2 ft. 7 in. broad at the point where the heel begins to curve. The interstices between the toes are also formed of cement, and the whole of the markings of the foot every now and again need repair. The inner portion of the heel and instep are the only parts that are clearly natural [gneiss] rock, (Skeen, loc. cit., p. 203.)\u2014B.]\n\n\u2020 Marco Polo says that an embassy was sent by the great Khan in 1284 while he himself was in China, to obtain relics of our father Adam. They obtained a couple of teeth, some hair, and a dish of prophry used by our first parent. He does not mention that they brought a piece of the rock from the foot-print.\u2014Yule's Marco Polo, Vol. II., p. 259.\nlittle gold which we gave to our guide. It is customary for pilgrims to pass three days in 'the cave of Khidhr,' and during this time to visit the Foot morning and evening; and so did we.\n\nWhen the three days had elapsed, we returned by way of the Mother's path, and encamped hard by the grotto of Cheim, who is the same as Cheith (Seth) son of Adam. We halted in succession near 'the bay of fish,' the straggling villages of Cormolak, Djeber-r\u00e2ou\u00e2n, Dildin\u00e9oueh and Atkalendjeh.* It was in the last named place that the Shaikh Abou 'Abd Allah, son of Khaifif passed the winter. All these villages and stations are on the mountain. Near the base, on the same path, is the d\u00e9rukht (dirakht) rew\u00e1n 'the walking tree,' a tree of great age, not one of whose leaves falls. It is called by the name of m\u00e2chi\u00e2h (walking) because a person looking at it from above the mountain considers it fixed a long distance off, and near the foot of the hill; while one who regards it from beneath, believes it to be in quite the opposite direction. I have seen at this place a band\n\n* [The correspondent before quoted writes:\u2014\"I fear the route taken by the traveller after leaving Kurun\u00e9gala must always be a matter of conjecture. I have given it some attention and I think it most probable that he went from Kurun\u00e9gala towards the mountains and ascended Adam's Peak from the pilgrim's path in Maskeliya. My reasons are\u2014\n\n(i.) The extreme limit of the inhabited region was evidently a long way from the Peak\u2014this would be true on the Maskeliya side, but not true in the low country, as there were villages comparatively near the Peak.\n\n(ii.) From the traveller's description he evidently went into the mountains soon after leaving Kurun\u00e9gala.\n\n(iii.) The names of places described are found on this route, and on no other.\n\n(iv.) The traveller describes two routes as practicable. The 'father's path' as rough and difficult, the 'mother's path' as easy and the way of return. He went by the former, which is evidently the way through the hills and the forest of Maskeliya.\n\nThe most convenient pass from Kurun\u00e9gala to the mountains runs past Girih\u00e1gama, and there is a cave in the mountain side near a little vale (exactly as described) which still retains the name Galagedara ('cave abode').\nof djoguis, who did not leave the foot of the hill, waiting for the fall of the leaves of this tree. It is planted in a place where there is no possibility of getting at it. The idolaters retail some fictions concerning it; among them, this\u2014whoever eats of its leaves recovers his youth, even should he be an old man. But that is false.\n\nUnder this mountain is a great vale where precious stones are found. Its waters appear to the eye extremely blue. From this we marched for two days as far as the town of Din\u00e9wer, a large one, built near the sea and inhabited by merchants.* In a vast temple is seen an idol bearing the same name as the town. In this temple are upwards of a thousand Br\u0101hm\u012bns and djoguis,\n\n*Monkey vale' I cannot identify; there is a place in Dolosb\u0101g\u0113 called Wanduru-m\u0101na ('monkey measure').\n\n'The vale of bamboos (or reeds)' I should guess to be Rambukpi\u1e6diya in Upper Bulatgama; it is of some antiquity and importance, and lies right on the road to Adam's Peak.\n\nThe spot where 'Ab\u016b Abd-Allah found his two rubies is probably even yet to be identified by the name Menik-hambanto\u1e6da ('the gem ford of the foreign trader') on the pilgrim's route. 'The house of the old woman' (A 'chchi-gedara?) has probably not survived till our time. The rest of the route lay through 'the wilderness of the Peak,' containing no inhabitants but hermits. The Royal hermit called S\u00e9bik I should guess to be 'Raja Savlu (or Sakra) Vije Bahu,' afterwards father of the \u015ar\u012b-Par\u0101krama B\u0101hu VI. (Valentyn, p. 71, and K\u0101vyas\u0113kara, 89.) Of the straggling villages mentioned as halting places on the journey to Dondra, Cormolah is probably Gilimal\u0113; Dildin\u0113oueh may be either Dinawaka or a Deldeniya; and Atkalandjeh is certainly the Atakalan K\u014dral\u0113, the last district 'on the mountain' (i.e., Kanda-u\u1e0da or in the U\u1e0da-r\u0101\u1e6da).\n\n\"The pass would probably be that traversed on the road from D\u0101pan\u0113 to U'rubokka, which is the beginning of 'the great vale [leading to M\u00e1tara] where precious stones are found. Its waters appear to the eye extremely blue'\u2014of course the reference is to the N\u012bval\u0101-ganga ('blue-cloud-river')\u2014and precious stones are still found there in some quantity (Cf. Pybus' Journey to Kandy, p. 22). Din\u00e9wer is of course D\u00e9wi-nuwara, and K\u0101ly, Galle.\"\u2014B.]\n\n* Din\u00e9wer.\u2014Dondra.

The town and its revenues are the private property of the idol; all who live in the temple and those who visit it are supported therefrom. The statue is of gold and of the size of a man. In place of eyes, it has two large rubies, and I was told that they shone by night like two lamps.\n\nWe took our departure for the town of K\u0101ly,* a small one, six parasangs from Din\u0113wer. A Musalm\u0101n there, called the Ship-Captain Ibr\u0101h\u012bm, entertained us at his house. We then took the route for the town of Calenbou (Colombo), one of the largest and most beautiful in the island of S\u0113rendib. There dwells the Vizier, prince of the sea, Dj\u0101lesty,\u2020 who has there about 500 Abyssinians. Three days after leaving Calenbou, we arrived at Batth\u0101l\u0101h, of which mention is made above. We visited the Sultan of whom I have spoken. I found the Captain Ibr\u0101h\u012bm awaiting me, and we left for the country of Ma'b\u0101r.\n\n[Ibn Bat\u016bta and his friends met with tempestuous weather, and were wrecked on the Coast of Coromandel, probably near the mouth of the Patar. He and his party, consisting of two concubines, some companions and slaves, were conducted to Arcot, and thence two days journey to the Sultan, who was engaged in an expedition against the infidels.

He landed at Perivilis (? Barberyn) \u201cover against Paradise. Here a certain tyrant, by name Coya Jaan, a eunuch, had the mastery in opposition to the lawful king. He was an accursed Saracen, who, by means of his great treasures, had gained possession of the greater part of the kingdom.\u201d This person \u201cin the politest manner\u201d robbed him of the valuable gifts he was carrying home to the Pope, and detained him four months.\u2014Yule\u2019s \u2018Cathay,\u2019 p. 357.\nGhiy\u0101th edd\u012bn, whose wife was a sister of a woman Ibn Bat\u016bta had married at Delhi: he is therefore above called his brother-in-law. Ibn Bat\u016bta was hospitably entertained; and he thus continues:\n\nI had an interview with the Sultan and proposed the subject of the M\u00e1ldives, and the sending of an army to the islands. He formed a resolve to accomplish this object, and appointed the ships for the purpose. He arranged a present for the Queen of M\u00e1ldives, robes of honor, and gifts for the Emirs and Viziers. He entrusted to me the care of securing a marriage for him with the sister of the Queen; and lastly, he ordered three ships to be loaded with alms for the poor of the islands, and said to me, \"You will get back in five days.\" The Admiral Khodjak Serlec said to him, \"It will not be possible to go to the M\u00e1ldives until three months from this moment.\" The Sultan went on to address me, \"Since that is so, come to Fattan, so that we may finish this expedition and return to our capital at Moutrah (Madura): you will set out from there.\" I then remained with him, and as we waited I sent for my concubines and my comrades.\n\n[Ghiy\u0101th edd\u012bn won a great victory over the infidels and returned with Ibn Bat\u016bta to Fattan (? D\u00e9vipatam) a large seaport town, and thence to Madura. At Fattan the Sultan told the Admiral to cease preparing the vessels for the M\u00e1ldives expedition. He was then suffering from an illness, and shortly afterward died at a place near Madura. He left no son, and his nephew, N\u0101ssir edd\u012bn, whom Ibn Bat\u016bta had known as a domestic servant at Delhi, was accepted by the army, and reigned in his stead.]\n\nHe [N\u0101ssir edd\u012bn] ordered that I should be provided with all the ships which his uncle had assigned to take me to the M\u00e1ldives. But I was attacked with fever, which is mortal at this place. I imagined that I was about to die. God inspired me to have recourse to the tamarind, which is very abundant in that country: I took about a pound and put it in water. I then\ndrank the beverage, and that relieved me in three days, and God healed me. I took a disgust for the town of Moutrah, and requested the Sultan's permission to take a voyage. He said, \"Where would you go? There remains only a month ere you start for the Maldives. Remain here and we shall give you all the equipment ordered by the master of the world (the deceased Sultan).\" I declined, and he wrote an order in my favor to Fattan, that I should be allowed to depart in any vessel I would. I returned to that town, and there found eight vessels setting sail for Yemen, and in one of them I embarked.\n\n[Ibn Bat\u00fata left this ship at Caoulem (Quilon) on the Malabar Coast, and there remained for three months. He then embarked in another, which was attacked by the pirates near Hinaour (Honore), and the traveller lost all his property, including the pearls and precious stones presented to him by the Ceylon King, and all his clothes:]\n\nI returned to Calicut and entered one of the Mosques. A lawyer sent me a suit of clothes; the K\u0101zi, a turban; and a merchant, another coat. I was here informed of the marriage of the Vizier 'Abd Allah with the Queen Khad\u012bdjah, after the death of the Vizier Dj\u00e9m\u00e2l eddin, and I heard that my wife, whom I had left enceinte, was delivered of a male child. It came into my heart to go back to the Maldives, but I feared the enmity which existed between me and the Vizier A'b'd Allah. In consequence, I opened the Kur\u00e1n, and these words appeared before me, \"The angels shall descend unto them, and shall say, 'Fear not, neither be ye grieved.'\" (Kur\u00e1n, Sur. xii., 30.) I implored the benediction of God, took my departure, and arrived in ten days at the Maldives, and landed at the island of Cannalo\u00fbs. The Governor of this island, 'Abd al 'Az\u00eez Almakdach\u00e2ouy, welcomed me with respect, entertained me, and got a barque ready. I arrived in due course at Hololy,* an island to which the Queen and her sisters\n\n* Hololy:\u2014Probaly Oluveli island in North M\u00e2le Atol.\u2014B.\nresort for their diversion and for bathing. The natives term these amusements *teidjer,* and they then have games on board the vessels. The Vizier and chiefs send offerings to the Queen of such things as are found in the island. I met there the Queen's sister, wife of the preacher Mohammed, son of Dj\u00e9mil eddin, and his mother, who had been my wife. The preacher visited me, and he was served with food.\n\nMeanwhile some of the inhabitants went across to the Vizier 'Abd Allah and announced my arrival. He put some questions about me and the persons who had come with me, and was informed that I had come to take my son, who was now about two years old. The mother presented herself before the Vizier to complain of me, but he told her, \"I will not prevent him taking away his son.\" He pressed me to go to the island (Mahal), and lodged me in a house built opposite the tower of his Palace, in order that he might be aware of my estate. He sent me a complete suit of clothes, betel, and rose-water, according to custom. I took to him two pieces of silk to throw down at the moment of saluting him. These were received from me, with the intimation that the Vizier would not come out to receive me that day. My son was brought to me, and it seemed to me that a sojourn among the islanders was what was best for him. I, therefore, sent him back, and remained five days in the island. I thought it best to hasten my departure, and asked the usual permission. The Vizier sent for me and I repaired to his presence. They brought to me the two pieces of stuff they had previously taken from me, and I cast them before the Vizier and saluted him in the customary way. He made me sit by his side and questioned me of my condition. I ate in his company and washed my hands in the same basin with him, which thing he does with no one. Then betel was brought and I came away. The Vizier sent me\n\n* Tetdjer:\u2014Cf. M. kuli-jahan \u2018sports.\u2019\u2014B.\ncloths and *bostous* of cowries, and conducted himself towards me in the most perfect way. I took my departure and after a voyage of forty-three days we arrived at Bengal.\n\n[The son of Ibn Batt\u00fata here spoken of was probably born before the close of 1344. The traveller therefore took his final departure from the M\u00e1ldives about the close of the year 1346.]\n", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-03", "created": "2025-10-03", "metadata":
