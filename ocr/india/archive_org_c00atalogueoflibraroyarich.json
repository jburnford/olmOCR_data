The few students and savants\u2014who were obliged to have recourse to it for their researches\u2014had only for guides the somewhat meagre list of Books and Charts printed in the Council's Report for the year 1865, the manuscript list of the books forming the collection of Mr. Wylie, and the memory of the Librarian.\n\nThis Catalogue will show the poverty of the Library and probably induce public-spirited men to add to its value by presenting works which they may have thought of no interest or already in the collection. Libraries begin to make real progress only when their contents are well known and their object well determined. Mr. Wylie's Library served as the nucleus of a good series of works on China, and its 718 volumes or pamphlets, added to those already in the possession of the Asiatic Society, formed a collection of standard works on the East numbering about 1,300 volumes.\n\nHowever valuable this collection may be, its deficiency is very great; and many a volume which an Orientalist ought to find is sought in vain through the pages of the Catalogue. Works of reference, which, whatever is the specialty of a Library, should always have place on its shelves, are also sadly conspicuous by their absence. Now that the paucity of our resources is known, no doubt people will come forward and help us to fill the blanks, unfortunately too numerous. Let every one bear in mind that nothing is to be rejected\u2014a pamphlet, a newspaper, nay a handbill, which to the ordinary\n\n---\n\n1 The Books belonging to the Wylie Library are designated in the Catalogue by an asterisk (*).\n\n2 These figures do not include the 1,023 Chinese volumes of Mr. Wylie and the Transactions of Learned Societies and Periodical Publications, which form one of the most important classes of the Library.\nreader is no more than a valueless scrap of paper, may become, in the hands of the searcher, the means of an important discovery.\n\nOne word more. Some notes have been added to the description of the works,\u2014whether they will prove useful will be best judged by those who may have to go through the Catalogue. But in Shanghai, where the saying \"Time is Money\" is perhaps truer than in any other place in the world, it has been thought that by reference to them much time could be saved. Biographical Dictionaries and Biographical Treaties, Catalogues of Libraries and Booksellers, and especially the Catalogue of Klaproth's Collection, the classification of which has been adopted by the compiler, at least in its principal divisions, supplied the materials for those. The divisions will be found perhaps too numerous, but it must not be forgotten that this is only the skeleton of a Library and that some room must be provided for future acquisitions.\n\nH. C.\nMy predecessor, M. Henri Cordier, in his preface to the First Edition of the Catalogue of our Library, says: \"Now that the paucity of our resources is known, no doubt people will come forward and help us to fill the blanks, unfortunately too numerous.\"\n\nI may say at once that M. Cordier's anticipations have not been fulfilled. Donations to the Library, since the first Edition of the Catalogue was issued, have been, unfortunately, very few, and even for those we have received we are indebted not to our fellow-residents but to societies and individuals in other countries, a proof, according to my idea, that much more interest is taken in our proceedings, and much more sympathy is felt with our labours, at home than in China. Foreigners who have settled down in this country appear indeed to regard its progress and development with just as much indifference as was entertained in Europe two hundred years ago regarding the affairs of this Empire. For all this, however, the literature on China has expanded of late years so enormously that even the greatest and richest libraries in the world will find it difficult to secure a copy of every work that has been published on the subject, and as far as we are concerned \"the paucity of our resources\" is as much in evidence now as it was in M. Cordier's time; so that authors who have written on China need feel no astonishment if they are not represented on the shelves of our Library, seeing that so few of them have thought it worth their while to present us with copies of their works, whilst so many are indebted to us for the facilities we are always ready to afford to those who wish to study or write upon the subject.\n\nOwing to this lack of sympathy and support on the part of those whom we may call \"our own authors,\" our Library on China and the Far East must continue to be rather limited and behind the times, unless we go around from writer to writer, and from publisher to publisher, begging for contributions to our shelves; and in the interest of our members and\nfor the furtherance of the objects for the promotion of which we are incorporated, we are prepared, if necessary, to do this. There may be people who will say such a course is not befitting us, but to this our answer must be that one of our chief objects is to possess a first-class library of books relating, directly or indirectly, to China and the East, and, if possible, to the Orient in general, and that if authors do not come forward voluntarily to support, we must endeavour by the best means in our power to induce them to recognise our claims.\n\nIn order to attain the object just stated, namely to acquire a complete Library relating to the Far East, the collection in our possession has been rearranged. A great many books irrelevant to the subject have been laid aside, and will be formed later on into a special section. Books on Natural History have been handed over to the Museum branch.\n\nM. Cordier also remarks in his preface, \"The divisions will be found, perhaps, too numerous,\" and I am sorry to say that in view of our slow expansion the same observation is still pertinent to our collection. After the lapse of 22 years, when our first Catalogue was issued, all we have in our possession is still a skeleton Library, but nevertheless it has not been considered fair towards our first Librarian, who eminently distinguished himself in the establishment of the Library and the compiling of the Catalogue, or towards those members who still think it worth their while to make use of the collection, to alter the divisions of the books. I am afraid, at the present rate of increase, that the \"room\" to which M. Cordier referred as necessary \"for future acquisition\" will not be filled for twice 22 years.\n\nThe Library has had to be arranged according to the principles laid down by Lloyd P. Smith in \"The Qualifications of a Librarian.\" There has to be \"A place for everything and everything in its place.\" A perusal of the Catalogue now issued and an examination of our shelves will serve to show if this principle has been carried out. Many of our books, and amongst them some of the most valuable in our possession, have been lost. To those who omitted to return volumes taken away by them from the Library, we say that we cannot commend them for good taste or for conscience,\nand to those who brought their books back in a forlorn and dilapidated condition,\u2014well, we live in the fatalistic East and have to be philosophers.\n\nTel est le sort de tout livre pr\u00eat\u00e9:\nSouvent il est perdu, toujours il est g\u00e2t\u00e9.\n\nThe Rules of the Library have been posted up in many conspicuous places in the building, where they can be easily read by whoever thinks it worth his while to do so, but this measure even seems to prove without success.\n\nThe Librarian has availed himself of Rule V, which says that\u201cCertain rare and valuable books shall not be removed from the Library building,\u201d and has marked with a dagger (\u2020) those which are the rarest in the Catalogue. He will see that those volumes are not taken out on any pretence.\n\nThe numbers in the present Catalogue run up to 1325. Will this number be doubled when the fourth Edition is published?\n\nJoseph Haas,\nHon. Librarian.\n\nChina Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society,\nShanghai, May 10th, 1894.\nPREFACE\nTO THE FOURTH EDITION.\n\nSince, in 1894, Mr. Joseph Haas completed the third edition of the library catalogue there has been but one issue of a list of additions thereto, namely that compiled in 1899, by Herr Emil Fischer and published in Vol. XXX of the Journal. Members of the Society and the reading public generally, have, therefore, since then, been in ignorance of much that the library contains.\n\nIn 1907 after careful deliberation, the Council decided that a new catalogue be prepared\u2014that all the books in the library, instead of being kept, as heretofore apart as a \"Museum Section,\" China Section, etc. should be included in the same Catalogue, and finally, that one of the most modern systems of classification should be adopted.\n\nUpon the strong recommendation of Mr. Bolton of the Athen\u00e6um, Boston, U.S.A. who rendered invaluable aid, it was decided to make a \"dictionary catalogue\" on cards, classifying according to the Dewey Decimal Classification and Index, used in conjunction with the Cutter Author Numbers. It may be well to give in the words of the author a short explanation of this classification.\n\n\"The field of knowledge is divided into nine main classes, and these are numbered by the digits 1 to 9\u2014Encyclopaedias, periodicals, etc., so general in character as to belong to no one of these classes are marked nought and form a tenth class. Each class is similarly separated into 9 divisions, divisions are similarly divided into 9 sections, and the process is repeated as often as is necessary. The books on the shelves are arranged in simple numerical order, and since each subject has a definite number it follows that all books on any subject must stand together.\"\n\nThe Cutter Numbers for their part provide each book with a Shelf Number in addition to its Class Number.\nMain Divisions of Classification.\n\n000 General Works.\n010 Bibliography.\n020 Library Economy.\n030 General Cyclicopedia.\n040 General Collections.\n050 General Periodicals.\n060 General Societies.\n070 Newspapers.\n080 Special Libraries.

Therein works appear, not only under their author's name, their title, but also under the subject, or subjects, to which they refer. For instance, M. Cordier's Edition of Yule's Marco Polo will be found under Cordier, Yule, Polo, Travel, Asia (travels in). The student, desirous of knowing what books on any particular subject the library can place at his disposal has but to turn that subject up. \"Inscriptions\" \"Birds\" \"Language\" \"Geology\" \"History\" etc., as the case may be. Under each heading he will find a list of the works thereon.\n\nIn 1908 this catalogue was completed and the books were re-shelved. During this work the old catalogue was in continual use and but few changes were found necessary, in the actual classification,\u2014while the ample and studious notes, of my predecessors, were carefully preserved. Copies of the old catalogue being dissected and the note on each work, being pasted on to the title and reference cards of the new Catalogue.\n\nWhile the advantages of this card system, its possibility of infinite expansion, its comprehensiveness, etc., are obvious, the disadvantages are no less so. To those members of the\nSociety who do not live in Shanghai the complete contents of the library were as unknown as ever, and even for those on the spot, a journey to the library itself, was necessary, to discover these same contents.\n\nIt was therefore decided, to print, and issue in book form, a classified catalogue arranged according to subjects. This of necessity, has been done in a manner as abbreviated as possible. Each work is mentioned, it is true, but only once, and then in the class to which it belongs. Its title is where possible condensed\u2014its author is shorn of all titles and degrees\u2014in fact the printed catalogue is but a skeleton of the card catalogue which may be consulted in the library itself.\n\nSuch as it is however it will serve to bring to the notice of all our friends not only what the library contains, but what it lacks. Many of the remarks of M. Cordier and M. Haas apply to-day as they did 15 years ago; but judging by the generous and immediate response that has met all my requests for assistance during this period of re-organization, I feel that it is only through forgetfulness that the library is ever neglected\u2014and can but hope that this booklet may serve as a silent reminder, to those who have aught to give, that an honoured place for the fruit of their labours is prepared on the library shelves of the N.C.B.R.A.S.\n\nFlorence Wheelock Ayscough.\nHon.
