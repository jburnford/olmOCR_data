About the hero see \"Malayan Annals,\" translated by Leyden, chapters xiv. and xvi. A small extract is found in Crawfurd's \"History of the Indian Archipelago,\" ii. p. 51. Manuscripts of this work, the text of which might be available, are in the possession of Mr. J. Pijnappel, at Leyden; and of Mr. E. Netscher, at Riyow.* The last chapters of this tale are found in No. 2,607 of the manuscripts of the India Office, commencing with that\n\n---\n\n1 [This article has been revised from the Dutch translation in \"Bijdragen,\" III. vol. i. pp. 409-74. In the references to other collections of Malay MSS. the following abbreviations have been used:\u2014I.O. = India Office Library (\"Tijdschrift van Nederlandsch Indi\u00eb,\" 1849, vol. i. pp. 385-400); B.M. = British Museum (\"Bijdragen,\" III. vol. vi. pp. 96-101); L. = Leiden (ib., III. vol. v. pp. 142-78); Bat. = Batavia (L.

Texts from one manuscript, such as those published by Mr. J. J. de Hollander, in Holland, are not to be depended upon. Even quotations, found somewhere, I shall take notice of, as it may be useful to the editor of a Malay text to consult them.\n\nSECOND SERIES.\u2014VOL. II.\npart where the king of M\u00e4laka intends to make one of his sons king on Mount Siguntang.*\n\nThis composition is very interesting, as it exhibits a faithful picture of Malay life, and is written in genuine Malay.\\(^1\\)\n\nNo. 2 (large folio of 288 pages; the last four pages are filled up with doggrel rhymes by some transcriber). This manuscript appears to be a transcript made by a native of Java, for a great many words belonging to the Malay dialect of Java occur in it; as, for instance, uribang, flower of the hibiscus rosa Sinensis; b\u00f2p\u00e8ng, pock-marked; kul\u00f2n, west,\\(^\u2020\\) &c. It also abounds with Javanese titles, as d\u00f2mang, ngab\u00e9hi, kanduriwan, &c. The manuscript is in many passages too corrupt to be of use in editing the text. The transcriber has often changed words he did not understand into such as resembled them in sound, or nearly so.\\(^\u2021\\) But what is very strange, it has now and then a form less corrupted than the Javanese; v.g. nantab\u00f3ga (p.188) instead of the Javanese antaboga (a corruption of the Kavi anantabhoga). As to the contents, it follows the Javanese poem only to a certain extent, whilst it oftens contains passages which are not explicable otherwise than by supposing that a Javanese original has been translated or imitated, which did not deviate so much from the original Kavi poem, as the one published by Mr. A. B. Cohen Stuart. Although it is evidently taken from the Javanese, its first and last pages contain matter not found either in the Kavi or Javanese work, whilst no trace is found of the introduction, wherein the king, J\u00e1ya B\u00e1ya, in whose reign Mpu S\u00ecdah, the Javanese author,\n\n---\n\n* See No. 66 of my \"Kort Verslag der Maleische Handschriften in het East India House, London,\" where the reader will find a full account of those closing chapters. As the numbers in that account have been since changed, I shall give here the present numbers in the India Office Collection.\n\n\\(^1\\) [B.M. 9; L. 1762; Bat. 186. Copious extracts are given by G. K. Niemann in his \"Bloemlezing uit Maleische Geschriften\" (1878), vol. i. p. 1-104; vol. ii. p. 58-120.]\n\n\\(^\u2020\\) Even Dutch words, as, for instance, \u0628\u0644\u064e\u0648\u064f (blaauw, blue), occur in it.\n\n\\(^\u2021\\) So, for instance, we find passim \u062f\u0631\u0647\u0645 (Ar.) instead of \u062f\u0631\u0647\u0645\u0627 (alms, largesses of a king to priests and religious mendicants).\nlived, is spoken of in laudatory terms; moreover, the title B\u0101rata yuda (Bh\u0101rata-yuddha), which is given to the Javanese version, is not known in Malay; and the great war between the Koravas and P\u0101ndavas, wherever it is alluded to in Malay compositions, is always called p\u0101rang P\u0101nd\u0101wa Jaya, \"the war of the victorious P\u0101ndavas.\" Not until we reach p. 134 do the contents of this manuscript resemble the Kavi and Javanese composition. The Malay author says in the opening that his work, although containing the story of the Pandava Pancha Kalima,* gives a great many beautiful tales in the beginning, and afterwards the tale named Hikayat Pandava Jaya. These beautiful tales are, he says, a collection of Javanese dramatic compositions (l\u0101lakon), to which he gives no particular names. I shall, on another occasion,\u2020 make an analysis of the whole and divide it into three parts. The first will give a rapid view of the contents from pp. 1\u2013134, being what is not found either in the Kavi or Javanese work. The second will be more circumstantial, as it may illustrate the difficult passages of the Kavi original, and will comprise what is found from pp. 134\u2013208, being the record of the great war. The third will give only a brief account of the contents from p. 208 to the end, as it deviates in this part almost in every respect from the Javanese version,\u2021 which closes with a eulogy of king Jaya B\u0101ya, of which no trace is found in this manuscript.\n\nThe library of the India Office is possessed of two manuscripts bearing on the same subject, but only containing the description of the war. They are numbered 2,384 (small 4to, 234 pages), and 2,605 (8vo, 176 pages). Both commence with introducing to the reader the chief heroes who figure in it, and then speak of K\u0101\u015bna's \u00a7 mission to demand the half of the kingdom in behalf of\n\n* Translation of pancha.\n\u2020 [\"Tijdschrift voor de T. L. en V.,\" vol. xxi. p. 1\u201390.]\n\u2021 Of the Kavi version only twelve copies (!) have been lithographed by order of the Dutch government. It is not complete, ending with the combat of Arjuna and Asvatth\u0101ma.\n\u00a7 K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\nthe five sons of Pandu.* To enable the reader to form a judgment of the difference of the texts of the three manuscripts, some specimens are here given.\n\nThe names of the four holy men (rishi) that join Kasna when setting out for Hastinapura as mediator are in No. 2,603, and in No. 2,384, and in this manuscript, and in this manuscript,\n\nThe passage where the Javanese version speaks of a human sacrifice being performed by either of the contending parties runs in No. 2,384 as follows:\n\nNo. 2,603 has:\n\nThis manuscript has (p. 147):\n\n* Leyden (\"As. Res.\" x. 178) mentions the following separate tales about the Pandavas: 1st, The tale about their gambling; 2nd, that about their borrowing a hall; 3rd, that about their selling lime.\n\n\u2020 In the Kavi poem they are Par\u0101\u015bur\u0101ma, Ka\u1e47va, Janaka, and N\u0101rada (the Javanese has the same, only differently spelt, according to the Javanese pronunciation).\nThe Kavi (x. 6) has: tuwin pada tlas makaryya bhisuweng* tgal paprangan | rawan ngaran i kang tawur nripati pandava murwvani | kunang tawur i sang nripeng kuru ya karilud brahmana | rikan siru cinapa sang dwija sagotra matiyalaga. \"Then they all performed a sacrifice on the field of battle, Rawan was the name of the victim of the Pandawa king, commencing; as to the victim of the Kuru king, a brahmana was . . . . , thence he was cursed by the twice born, to die with his [whole] family in fighting.\" This remarkable passage will perhaps attract the attention of some Sanskrit scholar, who may succeed in explaining it. In No. 21 (see below) I have not been able to find it.\n\nNo. 3 (large folio of 244 pages, imperfect at the end) contains the \u062d\u0643\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0631\u063a\u0628 \u0627\u0631\u064a \u0643\u0648\u062f \u0646\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0641. It is one of the Panji tales, containing the adventures of Inu Kartapati, prince of Kuripan. This manuscript commences with the king of Kuripan's getting a son, called at his birth Asmira ning rat Onddkan Jaya. Then the birth is\n\n* Instead of bhisuwa (bhisuwang is bhisuwa + ing) a manuscript on palm leaves in my possession has bhisu-cng (bhisu + ing). I should like to read here bhisawa (abhisawa). The Malay text gives no explanation, as it is evidently influenced by the Javanese version, where sagotra has become the name of a person. Moreover it identifies Rawan with a son of Arjuna (of the name of Irawan), who is afterwards killed by a demon (xii. 17). The word \u0641\u0645\u0627\u0644\u064a\u064a\u0633 \u0645\u0645\u0627\u0644\u0633 in the Malay version is probably a substantive made from \u0645\u0645\u0627\u0644\u0633, which occurs in the Hikayat Kumala bahriin with the sense of to turn off the evil influence of a ghost from a person who is supposed to have been visited by a ghost, and in consequence of it has got some disease (compare the Ngaju-Dayak palis). \u0645\u0645\u0627\u0644\u0633 must then have the meaning of what is used to turn off the evil influence of ghosts.\n\n1 In the Malay Panchatandaran (ed. Van der Tuuk, p. 46, l. 17), there is the following allusion to this human sacrifice:\n\nDharmaraja is the name by which Yudhisthira is known in Malay tales [I.O. 87; Bat. 143; J. J. de Hollander, \"Handleiding bij de Beoefening der Maleische Taal- en Letterkunde,\" 5th edition, p. 336, No. 2].\nrelated of *L\u0101smining puri Chandra-kirana*, the princess of Daha, also named *Puspaning rat,* and betrothed to the above-named prince of Kur\u012bpan. This princess, when yet a girl, was carried off by Bat\u0101ra K\u0101la, and placed with her attendants in a forest, where she changed her name and that of her waiting-women. The prince of Kur\u012bpan goes, attended by his followers, in quest of his intended bride, and in his rambles for that purpose takes the name of *Rangga Ariya Kuda N\u0101stapa*, his followers too changing each his name.\n\nNo. 4 (folio of 246 pages and ending abruptly) and No. 73 (small 4to. of 420 pages) both contain the \u062d\u0643\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0628\u062f\u064a\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0627\u064a\u0646\u060c an imitation of the Persian \u0637\u0648\u0637\u064a \u0646\u0627\u0645\u0647. On comparing the introduction, where the owner of the parrot (\u062e\u0648\u0627\u062c\u0647 \u0645\u06cc\u0645\u0648\u0646) is spoken of, I found the readings to be nearly the same. In my possession is a copy (folio of 90 pages) wherein the parrot tells thirteen tales. In the library of the India Office there are two manuscripts of this composition (Nos. 2604 and 2606). The former contains twenty-two tales, but the latter only ten, whilst the introduction about *Khajah Meymin* is wanting in it. According to Abdu-llah the Moonshee this composition also goes by the name of \u062d\u0643\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u062c\u0647 \u0645\u06cc\u0645\u0648\u0646 after the parrot\u2019s owner. The two manuscripts of the India Office seem to belong to one and the same version, and only differ in the proper names, which have been changed to Malay ones in No. 2606. The versions in both differ from my manuscript.\n\nNo. 5 (folio of 315 pages) contains the \u062d\u0643\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u062f\u0627\u0645\u0631 \u0628\u0648\u0644\u0646. It is an imitation in prose of the Javanese poem, the commencement of which has been published by Mr. J. J. de Hollander in the Reader, p. 158 sqq., at the end of his \"Handleiding bij de Beoefening der Javaansche Taal-\n\n---\n\n* Compare under No. 14.  \n\u2020 See further \"Kort Verslag der Maleische Handschriften van het E. I. House,\" p. 394. [For a Makassar version see B. F. Matthes, \"Kort Verslag,\" No. 1, and for one in Bugi, ib. No. 90.  \n\u2021 See his Journal, p. 95 of the Singapore edition. Of this Journal there is also a reprint in the fourth volume of Meursinge's \"Maleisch Leesboek;\" and a French translation by Dulaurier.\nLetterkunde\" (Breda, 1848). A translation, as it would seem, of the Javanese poem is to be found in Roorda van Eysinga's \"Indi\u00ef:\" (Breda, 1843), p. 502 (3de boek, eerste deel.). No. 11 (folio of 151 pages, only written half-way down, the open spaces being perhaps intended for a translation) contains the same tale, but considerably abridged.\n\nNo. 6. See No. 31.\n\nNo. 7 (folio) contains:\n\nI. (71 pages) \u0634\u0639\u0631 \u064a\u0644\u064a\u0633\u0627\u0631\u06cc. This poem has been edited with a Dutch translation and annotations by Mr. R. van Ho\u00ebvell, in vol. xix. of the \"Transactions of the Batavian Society of Arts and Sciences,\" but may be had separately. A review of this edition is to be found in the \"Indisch Magazijn\" and the \"Gids\" (1847), and quotations from another manuscript in Roorda van Eysinga's \"Maleisch-Nederduitsch Woordenboek,\" under \u062f\u0627\u0641\u062a, \u062c\u0647\u064a\u0645, \u0628\u0648\u0643\u064a, \u062f\u0627\u0641, \u062f\u063a\u0631, \u0633\u0646\u062f\u0631, \u0631\u0627\u0648\u0646, \u0633\u0646\u062f\u0631, \u0633\u0646\u062a\u064a\u0645, and \u0633\u0646\u062f\u0631. Another copy is contained in No. 36 (folio of 130 pages, and ending abruptly). Both manuscripts may serve to correct the edited text. I subjoin here a specimen of the various readings:\n\nThe printed edition, p. 3, line 9 from below, has;\n\nSat\u016blah (baginda sampey)* kapantey | di lihatna p\u0101rahu (di atas lantey)\u2020 || langkap (lah sakaliyan)\u2021 kajang dan lantey | (b\u0101ik) \u00a7 lah put\u0101ri duduk b\u0101rjuntey ||\n\nPage 5, line 5 from above:\n\nTidurlah anakku bulang hulu | biyarlah ayahna b\u0101rjalan dahulu || (anakku pandang)\u00b6 hatiku pilu | bagcy di hiris dangan sambilu ||\n\nPage 6, line 4:\n\nSambilan bulan sambilan hari | (ku kandung)** di dalam (hutan duri)\u2020\u2020 ||\n\nPage 6, line 2 from below:\n\n* No. 7 has sampey baginda, and No. 36, sampey tuwan turun.\n\u2020 No. 36, t\u016brlalu b\u0101sey.\n\u2021 No. 36, dan.\n\u00a7 Nos. 7 and 36, correctly n\u0101ik.\n\u00b6 No. 7, anak ku pandang.\n** No. 7, kukandung.\n\u2020\u2020 No. 7, rightly diri.\nB\u0101rjal\u0101n lah baginda (laju manulih) * | rasa\u00f1a h\u0101ndak (b\u0101rbalik) \u2020 k\u0101mbali ||\n\nII. (69 pages) \u0634\u0639\u0631 \u0643\u0646 \u062a\u0645\u0628\u0648\u0647\u0646. This poem has been twice edited by J. J. de Hollander, once in the Reader of the first edition of his \"Handleiding bij de Beoefening der Maleische Taal- en Letterkunde,\" and once separately (Leyden, 1856), from an untrustworthy transcript evidently made in Java. The version of this manuscript has hardly anything in common with that of the one edited, but corresponds in many respects with that recension of the poem, from which Marsden has given extracts in the Reader at the end of his Grammar. The king mentioned in the opening is called here S\u0101ri nara-ind\u0101ra di Ch\u0101mpaka Jajar, but in the one edited Ratu Socha windu pura nagara. As proper names of females, Kin T\u0101dahan and Kin Pangalipur occur here; whilst the name of the heroine is sometimes shortened into Kin T\u0101buh, for the sake of rhyme and metre. Wira Daudani, Wira P\u0101ndapa and Wira K\u0101rta are found as proper names of males. The hero, the prince who fell in love with the heroine, goes here by the names of Puspa K\u0101nchana, Raden Inu,\u2021 Anak Mantiari, Inu Bangsawan, Raden Inu K\u0101rtapati,\u00a7 and Anak Inu. The beauty of the heroine is compared to that of Janurwati,\u00b6 the goddess of love (yangyang k\u0101suma), and the celestial nymph Nila-utama. Instead of taman (garden), this manuscript makes often use of the Kavi l\u0101langun.** Paduka Mah\u0101devi, Paduka Matur (?), and Paduka Liku are mentioned as inferior wives of the old king. The pages of the king employed on errands are called here pang\u0101lasan, instead\n\n* A correction by the editor instead of the words of the manuscript, sayang t\u0101rjalan.

The native tales speak always of delightful gardens, where a bathing-place is one of the first requisites.\nof b\u0101duwanda. This version, moreover, does not end so tragically; Indra bringing the two lovers back to life, accosting the heroine with anak galuh.* One of the characters represented is Si-Tuguk,\u2020 who is described as a kind of Falstaff, big-bellied and fond of fun. There is also a version in prose which goes by the name of \u062d\u0643\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0646\u062f\u0627\u0643\u064a \u0646\u0648\u0631\u0648\u0632. In this version, the heroine is the daughter of a king of IWanggar, and the waiting-maid, who dies with her, is called here, as in the printed edition, Kin Bayan. One of her most beloved nurses has the name of Antar\u0101smi, and is addressed by her with kakak or the Javanese \u1e6dimbok (elder sister). The principal attendants of the hero are Panta Wira Jaya and Jaran Angsoka. The place where the heroine is killed is here the wood (Jav. alas) Puchangan. The lovers are brought to life by B\u0101tara Kala, who changes them into lotus flowers, and then veils them in a cloud of incense. The residence is called in the end Sochawindu, but elsewhere only Pura nagara. The late Mr. H. C. Millies, at Utrecht, had a manuscript of this version. It is not worth publishing, but may be available for a new edition of the poem, of which there is a manuscript also in the library of King's College, if I recollect right. It is beyond all doubt that the poem as well as the tale belong to the widely spread cycle of the tales in which the adventures of Panji are related.\u2021\n\nIII.

The hero is carried off by a golden peacock; is sent by the king Sh\u0101hshiy\u0101n to B\u0101rma S\u0101qti; kills a giant or demon on Mount Ind\u0101ra Kila; \u2021 finds the wonderful sea in the midst of the world (tasik samud\u0101ra); meets with the princess Kum\u0101la R\u0101tna S\u0101ri; contends with the prince Lela Mang\u0101rna in exhibiting supernatural feats; is carried off by a genie (of the name of the name of \u062a\u0645\u0631\u062c\u0644\u0633), whose son (called \u062a\u0645\u0631\u062c\u0644\u0633) he kills; meets consecutively with mountains of gold and other precious metals, the seas of wonder and love; journeys in a cavern during a month; kills a serpent (of the name of \u0645\u0645\u0644\u0648\u062f), and a demon (called \u063a\u0648\u0631\u0642\u0633\u0627); meets with D\u0101rma Gangga, who instructs him in supernatural means of conquering his enemies, and with B\u0101rma S\u0101qti, &c. At last our hero comes home, and is made king of Samanta-pura with the title of Sultan Ind\u0101ra Mangind\u0101ra. No. 55 terminates with a great many erotic verses not found in the other copies.

It is very seldom that tales are divided into chapters (\u0641\u0635\u0644), of which there are here sixteen. In the commencement of the tale there is a kind of summary, wherein the hero is said to be a great king, who visited Mount Q\u016bf, China, and the land of the inferior gods (dewa), subjecting men and ghosts to his sovereignty. On p. 2 a State Samanda-puri is mentioned. Its king was called S\u0101riyawan, and was sprung from Ind\u0101ra Dewa Mahar\u0101ma Rupa, whilst his queen was of mere mortal extraction. He had two sons called Raja Ard\u0101n and Raja Mars\u0101dan. The two princes went with a large retinue to the forest Samanta Baranta, where a dewa of the name Sar\u0101ma Dewa was in the habit of enjoying himself. This god hated the king, their father, who had caused his residence to be destroyed in former times. He changed himself into an old man and visited the princes, saying that he wished to serve them. Contriving to separate them from their followers when engaged in hunting, the god transformed himself into an elephant, whom Ard\u0101n so hotly pursued, that he got the start of his brother, and at last found himself entirely alone. The god then flew away with the prince to the sky, but was killed by the young hero. Ard\u0101n, having arrived again on this sublunary orb, made the acquaintance of a \u1e5b\u1e63i called B\u0101yu R\u0101ma, who told him that he was not to revisit his country for many years. The prince remained in the dwelling of the holy man, who instructed him in all sorts of supernatural sciences. Mars\u0101dan goes in quest of his brother, and in his rambles arrives at Ind\u0101rapura, where he marries the king\u2019s only daughter,\nand succeeds his father-in-law.* Ard\u0101n has a great many adventures of the same kind, delivering a princess with her waiting women, &c. B\u00e4rma Shahd\u0101n, the hero of the tale, is a son of Mars\u0101dan Sh\u0101h, king of Kalingga dewa,\u2020 and his eldest brother is called here R\u0101jadir\u0101ja. This work is replete with pantuns, some of which are worthy of notice. The late Mr. P. P. Roorda van Eysinga possessed a manuscript (two volumes in folio), which he would have published, but for want of a sufficient number of subscribers: what has become of it I cannot say. J. J. de Hollander (\"Handleiding bij de Beoefening der Mal. Taal- en Letterkunde,\" 3rd edition, p. 332) says, I know not on what authority, that the author was Sheikh Ibn Abu Omar.\n\nNo. 13 is a number I could not find. Dulaurier has also omitted it in the list he gives (\"Journal Asiatique,\" 3rd series, x. 69) of titles of the manuscripts of this collection.\n\nNo. 14 (folio of 456 pages: on the back of the cover, Charang Kurina) contains the \u062d\u0643\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u062c\u0627\u0631\u063a \u0643\u0644\u064a\u064a\u0646. It is a tale belonging to the Panji cyclus. The commencement is about the king of Kuripan having two sons, the eldest being Karta Buwana, and the youngest Raden Asm\u0101ra Jaya, surnamed Ondakan Rawisdrangga, who was betrothed to the princess of Daha, called Raden Puspita-ning Rat.\u2021 The name by which this tale goes is the assumed name of the princess when she had fled from her father's residence in order to follow the prince, in the garb of a man.\n\nNo. 15 (small folio of 180 pages) contains the \u062d\u0643\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0645\u0647\u0631\u0627\u062c \u064a\u0648\u0645. The plot of this tale is nearly the same as that of the Bhaumak\u0101rya,\u00a7 relating the adventures of Boma\n\n* Called Bak\u012brma D\u0101li raja. The proper name Bak\u012brma is very frequent in Malay tales, and is a corruption of the Sanskrit vikrama; it is often confounded with Pak\u012brma.\n\n\u2020 The manuscript has \u0643\u0627\u0644\u0641\u0627\u062a \u062f\u064a\u0648 (p. 32).\n\n\u2021 Compare under No. 3. [B.M. S.]\n\n\u00a7 Edited by Friederich in the \"Transactions of the Batavian Society.\"\n(the Sanskrit Bhauma, son of the earth). He was the son of Bisnu (Vi\u1e63\u1e47u) by the goddess P\u0101rtiwi (Sans. pr\u012bthiv\u012b, earth), and became a powerful king, whom even the gods stood in dread of. As he, demon-fashion, annoyed the penitents, K\u0101sna (K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a) sends his son Samba against him. Boma is at last killed by Hanoman, after having himself killed Samba and Arjuna, who were, however, called into life again by Nar\u0101da (N\u0101rada) sent by Batara Guru for the purpose. The celebrated episode* of D\u0101rmadewa and D\u0101rmadewi is here inserted in the same way as in the Kavi poem, D\u0101rmadewa following Bisnu when incarnating himself into K\u0101sna and becoming Samba, whilst D\u0101rmadewi, after having burnt herself, becomes Janurwati,\u2020 and so is reunited to her former love. This tale is also named \u0633\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0628\u064e\u0629\u064f \u0628\u064e\u0647\u064e\u0627\u0645\u064e\u0629\u064c. The R.A.S.'s MS. (see also under No. 21) slightly differs from the one in the India Office (No. 2905, 4to, 120 pages). Raffles (\"History of Java,\" i. p. 388, first edition) mentions the Javanese version under the titles Buma Kalantaka and Embatali. The first name is no doubt Bhaumakalantaka (the death of the demon Bhauma, kala being used in Javanese to denote demons and Titans), as may be inferred from the Kavi poem, p. 233, where it is Bhau-m\u0101ntaka (Bhauma's end, the hero dying by the hand of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u). The Kavi version bears (ap. Raffles, l. l.) the name Anrakasura, which is to be corrected into Narak\u0101sura (the demon Naraka, another name of Bhauma). I shall give on another occasion an analysis of this Malay composition.\u00b2\n\nNo. 16 (folio of 206 pages). A duplicate is No. 62, I. (158 pages). The two manuscripts differ but slightly.

The author calls himself Nuru-dd\u012bn ibn \u2019Al\u012b ibn Hasanj\u012b, son of Muhammad, of the Hamid tribe, and a native of R\u0101n\u012br (see No. 78, IV.), and he composed it at Achih (Acheen) in the year of the Muhammadan era 1040, by order of Sultan Iskander II.

The twelfth chapter of the second book contains a summary of the history of Malay States; the thirteenth the history of Achilh up to the time of the author. In the first chapter of the fourth book there are several tales about the celebrated Ibrahim Ibn Adham, corresponding to some extent with the tale, published by Mr. P.

This collection of historical tales has been published for the greater part by Dulaurier in his \"Chroniques Malayes,\" and translated by Leyden (\"Malay Annals,\" edited by Sir Stamford Raffles). This MS., however, contains chapters not found in other copies, and not translated by Leyden. The last chapter but one, for instance, is about Sang Naya's conspiracy against the Portuguese at Malaka. There are several versions of these chronicles, as the reader will see from the various readings in Dulaurier's edition. No. 35 (folio of 117 pages), No. 39 (folio 120 pages), and No. 68 (small 4to) end with the death of Hang Kasturi, the last named number having besides an entirely different introduction, and being properly but an abridgment. In No. 76 (small 4to) only a part is found commencing with the chapter on the depredations of a Mangkasar prince (\u0643\u0631\u0627\u064a\u063a \u0633\u0648\u0643\u0648), and ending with the conquest of Malaka by the Portuguese.

To distinguish this composition from that which only relates to the war, I propose to call the last on account of its being so popular (see under No. 2), and the first As to the contents of this number, it is evident that it is an entirely different work, and by no means to be identified either with No. 2, or the two MSS. at the India Office (see under No. 2). The commencement narrates the birth of Par\u0101\u015bu Rama and Dewa B\u0101rata, sons of by the celestial nymph Manik. Then Sant\u0101nu is mentioned, and the birth of his children, who had a peculiar fishy smell about them, as they had been cut out of the belly of a fish, who had swallowed the seed of Sant\u0101nu. On p. 2 Paras\u0101ra cures the stinking princess Durgandini, and calls her afterwards Sayojana Suganda (sweet-scented at the distance of a yojana), taking her as his wife. She becomes the mother of Biy\u0101sa. Another part of the narrative is about B\u0101smaka, king of Mandira-s\u0101pta, who had three daughters, called Amba, Ambi, Ambalika. Amba becomes the wife of Dewabrata, who kills her by inadvertence. He therefore vows to surrender his life to a woman, burns his wife's body, and then goes to his brother, Parasurama, who consoles him and changes his name into Bisma. On p. 34 we find mention made of the birth of D\u0101star\u0101ta, Pandu Dewa Nata, and Widura S\u0101gma. D\u0101star\u0101ta was born blind, because his mother, when visited by Biyasa, from fear closed her eyes; Pandu's body was white as crystal because his mother had covered herself with a white veil when she conceived him; Widura S\u0101gma was born with one lame leg, as his mother had pulled his leg (?). On p. 38 the birth of Karna is related: he was the son of Sangyang\n\n* This title I derive from the first pages of No. 2, where the author calls the part of his work not bearing directly on the war by this name (see under No. 2).\n\u2020 [Probably Menaka.]\n\u2021 Dhritar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra. \u00a7 In Malay the name of P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du.\nRawi,* by Dewi P\u0101ta.\u2020 After this, the meeting is related of Bisnu and the goddess P\u0101rtiwi (see under No. 15), and then the birth of D\u0101rmadewa and D\u0101rmadewi (see under No. 15). On p. 91 we have the birth of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a) and Kak\u0101rsana (a surname of Baladewa). The last chapters relate the contest of Boma against Samba (see under No. 15). Although this composition is but a collection of narratives with no plot whatever to deserve the name of hikayat, it is very interesting, as it introduces nearly all the persons acting in the hikayat p\u0101rang Pand\u0101wa Jaya, and the hikayat Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Boma.\n\nNo. 22 (folio of 720 pages; the commencement is wanting) contains the \u062d\u0643\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0633\u0631\u064a \u0631\u0627\u0645. It is a very elaborate recension of the Malay Ramayana, from which Marsden has given extracts in the Reader at the end of his Grammar. A far shorter version has been published by Mr. P. P. Roorda van Eysinga (Amsterdam, 1843). A MS. in the Dutch India Office contains also a version of it as elaborate as this; it is in two small 4to volumes (marked Ned. Kolonien. Handschriften C. No. 1), the first volume being of 475, and the second of 654 pages.\n\nNo. 23 (folio of 698 pages) and No. 45 (4to. of 278 pages).

The first number corresponds in version with a manuscript belonging to the Dutch India Office (folio of 185 pages, and marked Ned. Kolonien. Handschriften C.

Another version is contained in No. 27 (folio of 347 pages), and No. 28 (folio of 348 pages: on the back of their cover, Hikayat Dalang Indra Kcsuna).

The title, \u062c\u064a\u0643\u0644 &c., of this Panji tale is after a name which the hero takes on his rambles in search of the princess of Daha, disguising himself as a man of the lowest class. This is one of the most interesting Malay compositions, and has influenced almost every literary production of the Malays; on another occasion I shall give an analysis of it. This cycle of stories has received by mistake also the name of \u062d\u0643\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0646\u0627\u064a \u0643\u0633\u0645\u0648\u0645 from its commencement, where a B\u0101tara Naya K\u0101suma, an inhabitant of Indra's heaven, is spoken of as the grandfather of K\u0101rtapati.\n\nNo. 24 (two folio volumes of 446 and 450 pages) contain the \u0633\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0629 \u0631\u0627\u062c\u0645 \u062f\u062a\u0627\u062b\u0647 \u062c\u0627\u0648. The first volume commences of course with Adam, whose son was Shith (\u0634\u064a\u062b), whose son was N\u016brchaya, whose son was Sangyang Wenang, whose son was Sangyang Tunggal, whose son was Guru, who had four sons and one daughter, being Sangyang Sambu, B\u0101rahma, Mah\u0101dewa, Bisnu, and Dewi S\u0101ri. Bisnu became king of Java with the title Prabu Seta (? \u0633\u064a\u062a). Then a chapter treats of the Ratu Sela P\u0101rivata of Giling B\u0101si. It ends with Pangcran Dipati taking the title of Susunan Mangku Rat Senapati, &c. The second volume commences with Susunan Mangku Rat being at Ba\u00f1u Mas, and ordering the Dipati of T\u012bgal to be fetched, and terminates with Susunan Pakubuwana's reign in K\u0101rtasura. Two quotations from this work have been given by Dulaurier in the \"Journal Asiatique\" for 1846.\n\nNo. 25 (folio of 304 pages). This Panji tale goes by the name of \u062d\u0643\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0645\u0627\u0644\u0643 \u0631\u0633\u064a\u0645\u06cc * \u0627\u0646\u063a \u0645\u0627\u0644\u0643 \u0631\u0633\u064a\u0645\u06cc from a name the heroine assumes when leading the life of a penitent. The commencement treats of the prince of Kuripan, called Kuda Jaya Asmara, surnamed K\u0101rtapati, who was betrothed to the princess of Daha, Raden Galuh Chand\u0101rakirana puspaning rat. A god falling in love with the\n\n* From the Javanese cendang (a female penitent or nun).\nsaid princess asked her of Batara Guru, but meeting with a refusal, as she was to be the wife of Kartapati, dropped her with her two waiting-women into a forest, where she led the life of a penitent, and changed her name and that of her companions. She is afterwards married to the prince, here passim called Raden Inu, who succeeds his father with the title of Parabu Anom ing Kuripan, the old king retiring to the woods to do penance.\n\nNo. 26 (folio of 239 pages). This Panji tale goes by the name \u0645\u0644\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0641\u0646\u0686 \u0648\u06cc\u0644 \u06a9\u0633\u0648\u0645. The commencement is almost the same as that of No. 23, relating the birth of Inu Kartapati, and that of the Raden Galuh Puspaningrat, surnamed Chandarakirana. Going in quest of his love, who is carried off by Batara Kala into a forest, the hero takes the name Mosa* Taman Panji Jayeng Kasuma. Afterwards in the course of the narrative he is called Sira Panji Wila Kasuma (p. 73 of MS.), but often merely Sira Panji. After a great many adventures he becomes king of all Java.\u2020 Werndly in his \"Maleische Boekzaal\" mentions a Hikayat Mosa Taman Wila Kasuma, and van Ho\u00ebvell, in his annotations on the Sair Bidasari, has given quotations from a Hikayat Panji Wila Kasuma, pp. 301, 326, 334, 339, 362, 363, and 374.\n\nNos. 27 and 28. See under No. 23.\n\nNo. 29 (folio, 645 pages; ends abruptly). This Panji tale has the lettering Hikayat Naga Bersru (on the flyleaf within). I dare not decide whether this is right, as I did not succeed in finding the reason for this title. Leyden, in his \"Dissertation on the Indo-Chinese Nations\" (As. Res. x.) speaks of a Hikayat Naga Bisaru,\u2021 or story of a princess of Daha, who was changed into a serpent, and banished to a lake. It is a pity he gave no explanation of the name. At all events this manuscript belongs to the Panji tales. It opens with the king of Kuripan asking\n\n* Jav.

The hero is here passim called Sira Panji and S\u0101ri Panji.\n\nNo. 30 (small folio of 74 pages; the wrong lettering on the back of the cover, Salasilah nabi Muhammad, is owing to the first words, which make Nuru-dd\u012bn a descendant of the prophet\u2019s) contains the \u062f\u0641\u062a\u0631 \u0634\u062c\u0631\u0629 \u0642\u0631\u0628\u0648\u0646. It is a genealogical account of the kings of Cheribon (properly, Chi-r\u0113bon), commencing with a confused tale about Sheykh N\u016bru-dd\u012bn, surnamed the Suhunan Gunung Jati, one of the apostles of the Isl\u0101m in Java. It is probably translated from a peculiar dialect of the Javanese, its language being anything but Malay, and mixed up with Javanese and occasionally with Sundanese words too. Besides the said Suhunan (\u201cReverend\u201d), other celebrated apostles, as the Suhunan\u2019s Kali Jaga, Ampel Danta, and Bonang are personated here as people endowed with miraculous gifts, and the conquest of Majapahit, Banten (Bantam), and Pajajaran (called here too by its ancient name Pakiwan) is briefly narrated. The Pan\u010dambah Sura Sohan, called also Mowl\u0101n\u0101 Hasanu-dd\u012bn, introduces, according to this chronicle, the Isl\u0101m in Pajajaran, the Lampong country, Ind\u0101rapura, Bangka-ulu (Bencoolen), and Balo. His elder brother, the Pan\u010dambah Pakung Wati rules the country from Krawang to Cheribon, he himself that from Bantam to Krawang.

All these versions are from the Persian.*\n\n* The Tamil version has been translated by Abdul-llah the Moonshee and published at Malaka [in 1835, 85 lithographed folio pages]. It is divided in the same way as the Panchatantra, and bears the title of \u0641\u0646\u06cc\u0647 \u062a\u0646\u062f\u0631\u0648\u0627\u0646.\nNo. 39.

The hero is the son of a king of \u063a\u0648\u0646\u0627\u062b\u064a in West Java. This king had two wives, the younger being \u0100mas Aj\u012bng, who bore him a son called \u062c\u0646\u0627\u0643\u0631 \u0646\u064a\u062a. She slanders the elder, making the king believe she had tried to poison him. The elder queen is defended by her son, who in consequence falls into disgrace, and is incarcerated. The queen herself is conducted into a forest to be killed, but the executioner, pitying her condition, leaves her in a grotto, where \u0628\u064a\u0627\u0631 \u0628\u0627\u0646\u0648 supplies her wants.

The story ends in a strange and abrupt way, as if not finished. I do not think it probable that this composition is the same as that mentioned by Bahrudd\u012bn under the title \u062d\u0643\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0633\u064a\u0631 \u0641\u0646\u062c \u0644\u0627\u0631 \u0643\u0633\u0648\u0645, which is decidedly a Panji tale.\n\nNo. 41 contains a Malay translation of a Javanese Wukon.* It is a miserable composition, not readable without the Javanese original.\n\nNo. 42\u2020 and No. 64.

This is all I could read, as the owner would not lend it me even for a day.\n\nII. \u0634\u0639\u0631 \u0633\u0628\u0648\u0631\u063a \u0641\u064a\u063a\u064a, an allegorical poem,\u2020 wherein the soul of man is spoken of as that of a bird (kalow t\u0101rbagn siburung pingey, \u2018al\u0101mat badan di makau ulat, if the pingey flies away, it is a sign that the body will be eaten by the worms).\n\nIII. \u0634\u0639\u0631 \u0641\u0631\u0627\u063a\u0629. An allegorical poem, wherein mankind is spoken of as a vessel tossing about on the waves. A small fragment is in my possession.\n\nIV. \u0634\u0639\u0631 \u0633\u064a\u062f\u063a \u0641\u0642\u064a\u0631. A copy is in my possession (small 4to of 14 pages). It is also an allegorical poem, speaking of mankind as forlorn and indigent.\n\nV. \u0643\u0634\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0646\u062c\u0644\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0628\u062d\u0627\u0646\u064a, a short exposition of God\u2019s nature, qualities, and works. Werndly knew it (see his \u201cBoekzaal,\u201d p. 354). It is quoted in the second book of the Taby\u0101n (see above, in the specification of Ranir\u2019s writings, No. VII.) as a book deserving to be burnt.\u2021\n\n* \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0646\u0635\u0648\u0631\u06cc Fantsur being the ancient name of Barus [see above, vol. i. p. 164]; hence the Barus camphor is called in Arabic \u0643\u0627\u0641\u0631 \u0628\u0627\u0631\u0633.\n\n\u2020 The poems of Hamzah were yet much read in Valentyn\u2019s time, but that he was a native of Barus that author did not know (see \u201cBeschrijving van Sumatra,\u201d p. 21).\n\n\u2021 The other books, the author of the Taby\u0101n speaks of in this way are the \u062f\u0627\u0626\u0631\u062a\u0627 \u0644\u0648\u062c\u0648\u062f, \u062d\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0642\u064a\u0646, \u062d\u0631\u0642\u0647, the \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0623\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0642\u06cc\u0642, the \u0633\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0628\u0648\u06cc\u0647 and the \u062a\u062d\u0642\u06cc\u0642\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0633\u0644\u0629.\nVI. \u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0645\u0646\u062a\u0647\u064a \u0641\u062f \u0645\u0631\u0627\u062c\u0646\u0627\u0643\u0646 \u0633\u0628\u062f \u0646\u0628\u064a.

It is cited in the second book of the Taby\u0101n. A badly mutilated copy is in the Leyden University Library (No. 1,332). The Sultan in whose reign it was composed is there only called \u0645\u0631\u062d\u0648\u0645 \u0645\u0627\u0643\u062a\u0628.\n\nII. \u0634\u0631\u062d \u0631\u0628\u0627\u0639\u064a \u062d\u0645\u0632\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0646\u0635\u0648\u0631\u064a. I saw at Padang a copy (8vo of 16 pages), but the owner would not part with it.

I am in hopes the deficiencies in this notice may be filled up by other scholars, who will also call attention to the many valuable Malay manuscripts in the Libraries of London. A New Malay Chrestomathy is urgently needed at the present time, as those published by Marsden, Meursinge, and de Hollander, are anything but trustworthy, each of the texts they contain having been taken from a single manuscript only. It is only by a careful comparison of many that a text can be furnished which may be depended upon by persons desirous of obtaining an adequate idea of the grammatical structure of the Malay language, and reluctant to trust the assertions of those who pretend that Malay is devoid of grammar.\nNOTE 3.\n\nThe proper name *si-lindung dalima* (Raffles Coll., No. 7, III.) had better be taken to mean \"she who excels the granate-apple in beauty.\" Thus we have in Menangkabau tales the name of a princess *si-lindung bulan*, \"who surpasses the moon in radiance\" (compare the Batak name *nan-chilok mata ni ari*, \"Miss Sun-stealer,\" see \"Bataksch Leesboek,\" IV. p. 157). In the prose edition of the poem, the heroine of which goes by the name of \u0633\u064a\u062f\u063a \u062f\u0644\u064a\u0645\u060c the proper name \u0633\u064a\u062f\u063a \u062f\u0644\u064a\u0645 also occurs (p. 15 of the I.O. MS.) ; the heroine's father is there called Dewa Lagasana, who had transformed himself into a granate-apple which, being eaten up by Sari Buniyah, became the cause of her pregnancy.\n\nNOTE 4.\n\nTo Raffles Collection, No. 62, V.\n\nMr. Engelmann informs me that there is also a Sundanese recension of this work, a copy of which (small 4to, 36 leaves) is in his possession. In it the prophet's advice is not only given to his daughter F\u00e2timah, but also to another female whom he calls Murtasiyah. I suspect that this proper name is nothing but the feminine of \u0645\u0631\u062a\u0636\u064a (a cognomen of F\u00e2timah's husband 'Al\u00ee), so that the second female recurring in the Sundanese recension has got in through misunderstanding. It is worth noting that \u0636 has become s, since this consonant is pronounced l both in Sundanese and Javanese (e.g., malarat i.q. Arabic \u0645\u0636\u0631\u0629). But as \u0636 is pronounced as a sibilant by the Persians and Indian Muhammedans, it is not improbable that the Sundanese redaction was subject to Kling or Bengali influence. The forming of female proper names by means of the termination *ah* is a\n\n1 [The following additional Notes (3-10) are found in the Dutch translation of this \"Account.\" See the note at the beginning of this article.]\nwell-known fact.* May not the Malay word rubiyah be explained as formed from \u0631\u064e\u0628\u0650\u0651\u064a (my lord), as the Malays generally know so little of Arabic that it could not well occur to them that \u0631\u064e\u0628\u0650\u0651\u064a is properly used only in reference to God? On the west coast of Sumatra they call rubiyah a female who keeps the five prescribed prayers (\u0641\u064f\u0631\u0636), reads the Koran, and, in short, lives in the fear of the Lord, while\u2014strangely enough!\u2014mande (mother) rubiyah, is a nickname for a procuress, or the keeper of a house of ill-fame. The name \u0631\u064e\u0628\u0650\u064a\u0639\u0647 (Raffles Coll., No. 70, II.) appears to convey an illusion to rubiyah. The usual cognomen of F\u0101timah in Malay is \u0627\u0644\u0632\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0621; hence they say of an unchaste woman:\n\n\u0646\u0627\u0626\u063a \u062f\u0628\u0627\u0648\u0629 \u0641\u0646\u062c \u0662 \u0641\u0627\u0637\u0645\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0632\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0621\n\n**Note 5.**\n\n*Ad No. 79, II., and No. 77, III.*\n\nOn \u0642\u062f\u0629 \u0643\u062f\u0629 for see the \u201cAnnotation to Panjatandaran\u201d (Leiden, 1866), p. xxii.\n\n**Note 6.**\n\n*Ad Raffles Coll., No. 2.*\n\nMr. Cohen Stuart informs me that from an interpretation given him by a Balinese, he has also been led to correct bisuwa into bhishawa\u2014a reading which I had already suggested in my pamphlet, \u201cTaco Roorda\u2019s beoefening van\u2019t Javaansch bekeken\u201d (p. 22, note 2).\n\n**Note 7.**\n\n*Ad Raffles Coll., No. 7, II.*\n\nConcerning inn compare vol. iv. of the \u201cBataksch Leesboek,\u201d p. 213.\n\n*The Javanese from Bulkiyah (for Bulqis) is probably due to a Menangkabau form Bulkih (cf. \u201cTobasche Spraakkunst,\u201d p. 50).*\nNOTE 8.\n\nAd Raffles Coll., No. 14.\n\nRawi sarangga, as one of the names of Panji, must mean \"ray of the sun,\" and have been chosen as a pendant to chandrakirana, \"ray of the moon,\" the cognomen of his betrothed.

(Bencoolen), 1822, pp. 1-11.]\n\nThis mountain, which stands detached from the regular range of hills, forms, by its peculiar and remarkable shape, an excellent landmark on this part of the coast. It lies about 18 miles N.E. of Bencoolen, but its exact position and distance had never been correctly ascertained. Two attempts had been made by Europeans to ascend the mountain, but without success, and a general impression prevailed that it was utterly impracticable to gain the summit. Remarkable mountains of this description are generally believed by the natives to be the residence of spirits, and their summits are considered as Kramats or places of peculiar sanctity.\u00b3\n\nA Kramat of this nature was said to exist on the top of the Sugar Loaf, and it was reported that the natives sometimes adventured to visit it from motives of superstition. It was therefore resolved to make another trial, in the expectation that it might afford the means of correcting and extending the observations already commenced on the coast, with a view to a more accurate survey of this part of the country.\n\n* [For the foot-notes the editor is indebted to the Hon. D. F. A. Hervey.]\n\n\u00b9 We should spell it Bengkok. This, which means \u201cwinding\u201d or \u201ccrooked,\u201d hardly tallies with the English name; but the Malays doubtless refer to different characteristics, possibly indicating the tortuous path which leads to it.\n\n\u00b2 The Malay name to which this is the English approximation is Bengkahilu. Hulu is source, of a river, and might imply that the Bencoolen river had its source in the Bengkok mountain. But while the mountain is here called Benko\u2019, it figures in Baron Melvill\u2019s map as Boengka (Bungka) [and in Favre\u2019s \u201cDictionary,\u201d as well as in the account of the Dutch expedition (\u201cMidden-Sumatra,\u201d Reisverhaal, 1881) as Bukit Bungkuk, or Dwarf Mountain.

They crossed the Bencoolen river a little above Tanjung Agung, and proceeding through the Lumba Selapan district, halted the first night at Lubu Pooar, a small Rejang village on the banks of a stream which falls into the Sungey Lamow.\\(^1\\) Thus far the journey was accomplished on horseback, but it was found impracticable to carry the horses any farther, and the party proceeded on foot to Punjong, a respectable village situated on the banks of the Simpang-ayer, and the residence of the Pasirah of the tribe of Marigi, the chief of the four into which the Rejangs are divided. The others are called Bermani, Saloopu, and Joru Kallang. On the third day they reached Rejak Bessi, the last village in the direction of the mountain, where they rested for the night. It is situated on the Ayer Kiti, a stream which falls into the Simpang-ayer below Punjong. The journey from Lubu Pooar to this might with ease have been accomplished in one day instead of two had the weather permitted.\n\nThe mountain was now to be attempted, and in order to ensure success, it was arranged to pitch a tent in the forest in case the ascent could not be accomplished in one day. From Rejak Bessi they proceeded over hilly ground gradually rising for about five miles, when they found their progress impeded by the increasing steepness of the ascent, and then halted under an overhanging rock, where the tent was pitched, as it was impossible to carry it any further, even if space could have been found to erect it on. The course from Rejak Bessi was through deep forests which precluded them from seeing the mountain. The last view they had of it was at Rejak Bessi, which it appeared to overhang, and whence they were able to form some idea of the difficulties they were likely to encounter from the steepness of the ascent and the precipitousness of the declivities. Soon after quitting Rejak Bessi they crossed a small river on a temporary bamboo bridge thrown across a deep chasm between two rocks, which confined the stream within a narrow channel after being precipitated over a fall of considerable height. A fine view of this fall was commanded from the bridge, which was itself suspended about one hundred feet above the stream, and the whole formed, with the surrounding forests, a beautiful and romantic scene. About ten o'clock they commenced the ascent of the cone along the rocky bed of a mountain torrent, until they arrived in front of a perpendicular face of bare rock stretching completely across the ravine which had hitherto afforded a passage, and seeming to bar all further progress. This difficulty was surmounted by placing two of the longest bamboos against the rock underneath where the bare root of a tree projected from above; by the aid of these\n\n\\(^1\\) More correctly Limau or L\u00e9mau.\nheld fast at the bottom, and afterwards secured by a rattan at the top, they succeeded in clambering up to the tree which overhung the precipice. The next acclivity terminated at the head of another ravine, where their progress was again checked by a jutting rock rendered moist by the trickling of a small spring of water from among its crevices. Here the guides declared that further ascent was impracticable, and that from thence the party might return as soon as they pleased. The fact is, they were extremely averse to their proceeding, fearing the vengeance of the evil spirits if they conducted strangers to the summit; they were, therefore, advising to return at every difficulty, and the ascent was ultimately accomplished without their aid, or rather in spite of them. The appearances around were calculated to confirm this assertion, but before determining to return they examined the extent of the precipice, and crossing the ravine, perceived that the opposite side, though almost perpendicular, had a thin coating of soil and moss, with numerous roots of trees half laid bare, by laying hold of which with the hands and placing the toes in the niches, they at length reached the ridge which formed the right-hand shoulder of the hill. Along this a path was found, sometimes along the base, sometimes over the face, of a succession of bare masses of rock, which it was necessary to clamber over by the aid of such twigs and roots as occasionally fastened themselves in their fissures. The last of these precipices was perhaps the most dizzy and dangerous, as it was necessary to make a step or two on a narrow ledge on the face of a cliff of such height that the eye could not discern the bottom, and thence catch at a dry stump barely within reach, by swinging from which it was possible with a considerable effort to clear the rock. The denseness of the moss and the stunted appearance of the trees now indicated their approach towards the top, and at length about two o\u2019clock they found themselves on the summit. This was a bare spot of not more than four or five yards in breadth with a precipice on each side partly concealed by brushwood. Of those who set out together from the foot of the hill a few only reached this point, by far the majority giving up in despair at different parts of the ascent, but the labour of those who persevered was amply recompensed by the view which opened from the summit. The line of the coast from Laye\\(^1\\) on the north to a considerable distance beyond Buffalo Point on the south was distinctly marked; the vessels in the basin of Rat Island were distinguishable with the aid of a glass, and the white ramparts of Fort Marlbro\u2019 were easily discerned. To the south, they looked down on the hills of Bukit Kandees,\\(^2\\) or the Lion\u2019s Rump, and Bukit Kabut (the hill of mist), which formed a straight\n\n\\(^1\\) This appears as La\u00efs in the Dutch maps.\n\n\\(^2\\) Kandis is the name of a tree (*Garcinia merguensis*) bearing an edible fruit.\nline with the Sugar Loaf. Inland the view was obscured by a cloud, which was evidently directing its course towards the hill, and it was necessary, therefore, to take the desired observations and bearings with all possible dispatch. This was done with a small compass, none of the larger instruments having been got up. The character of the vegetation was decidedly Alpine, the rocks and trunks of the trees being covered with dense moss,\u00b9 and many of the shrubs belonging to genera of higher latitudes, such as vaccinium, rhododendron, &c. There is also found here a shrub which the natives consider a substitute for tea,\u00b2 remarkable by its thick glossy leaves; it will form a new genus in the family of the Myrtaceae. Having finished their observations, they made haste to descend, as the cloud was now rapidly approaching the hill and threatened a deluge of rain. They found the descent fully as difficult as the ascent had been, but it was occasionally facilitated by fastening a long rattan to a tree above, and then sliding along it down the steepest places. It was necessary, however, to be cautious not to slide with too much velocity in order to be able to keep a footing when the rattan slipped from the hand. When they had got about half-way down, the cloud, which had now enveloped the hill, burst in a flood of rain, and rendered the footing still more insecure. The steepest parts, however, were then past, and the trees for a short while afforded some protection, but by the time they reached the lower ravines, the waters began to swell, and the latter part of the descent was in the very bed of the torrent. They arrived at the tent about an hour before sunset, and found the spot completely flooded; the rain had in no degree abated, and it was impossible to find shelter for the whole party of natives, &c., which was very numerous; it was, therefore, determined to make a push forward to Rejak Bessi, rather than pass the night in so uncomfortable a situation. A sharp walk brought them to the village soon after dark, and a good night\u2019s rest repaired the fatigues of the day. The next day was spent at the same place, both for the purpose of resting the people, and of bringing up the tent which had been left in the forest. On the 16th they travelled to Punjong, and the following day they commenced their return by another route, striking across the country in the direction of Bukit Kandees to the Bencoolen river. Sam-pans had been previously ordered to be in readiness at Tanjong.\n\n\u00b9 On Gunong Bel\u00famut in Johor, at from 2,000 feet onwards, the trees and saplings are thickly clothed with dripping moss, making stems only wrist-thick appear thigh-thick; hence the name \u201cthe be-mossed mountain,\u201d from limut, moss.\n\n\u00b2 There is a similar shrub on the summit of Mount Ophir at a height of about 4,200 feet, a spray of which stirred in boiling water gives it a very pleasant aromatic fragrance. This quality was discovered at the suggestion of Governor Sir F. Weld, who discerned in the plant a likeness to others he had seen possessing this quality on a mountain in one of the Australian colonies.\nSanei, and they arrived there about eleven o'clock, having in the latter part of the journey forded the main stream of the Bencoolen river no less than eleven times. About twelve they embarked on the sampans, and placed the baggage and some of the followers on bamboo rafts; the first part of the course was a constant succession of rapids, in shooting down which some management was necessary to avoid being upset upon the trunks of trees and other obstacles that lay in the way. Twice, by being driven against these, the boat was filled with water and with difficulty saved from being swamped. Below the junction of the Rindowati,\u00b9 the depth of the river increased and the current became more regular; and at length they landed near Bencoolen about nine at night, having thus accomplished, aided by the rapidity of the stream, in one day what would have occupied several in ascending.\n\nGunong Benko' is not estimated to exceed 3,000 feet in height,* but its shape, and its standing boldly out from the general range of hills, render it the most remarkable visible from Bencoolen. It is almost entirely composed of masses of basalt or trap, which is the most prevalent rock along this part of Sumatra. The whole of the country traversed on this occasion is exceedingly broken and irregular and but thinly inhabited. In the neighbourhood of the hill it is a complete forest and very wild, presenting an infinite number of romantic and beautiful views. The soil near the rivers is remarkably rich, and that of the forest tracts is little inferior, particularly in the bamboo groves, which indeed are generally found to prevail on the finest lands. The greater part of the rice is cultivated in ladangs,\u00b2 but there are a few sawahs. At Tello Anou is a small nutmeg plantation where the trees have never been manured, yet seem as thriving as any about town. The forests abound with noble timber trees; few animals were seen; of monkeys the Kra (S. fascicularis), and Chingkau (S. cristata), were the most common, and the loud cry of the Siamang (S. syndactyla) was frequently heard, though they did not come in sight. It is very singular to observe the young of the Chingkau and Simpai (S. melalophos) embracing their mothers, that of the former being fawn-coloured, while the adult is nearly black, and the latter having the young black while the mother is fawn-coloured, appearing exactly as if they had exchanged young ones.\n\nAt about half the height of the mountain the temperature of a small shallow spring was tried where it oozed from a cleft in a\n\n\u00b9 Perhaps for rindu h\u0101ti, desire of the heart\u2014i.e. an enchanting stream.\n* [In the new atlas of the Dutch East Indies, by Stemfoort and ten Siethoff, the height of the \"Suikerbrood\" or Sugar Loaf Mountain, is given as 1,029 metres; in Veth's \"Geographical Dictionary\" as 3,287 Rhenish feet.

Steck made a successful ascent.]\n\u00b2 Ladang, plantation on high ground, dry cultivation; sawah, padi or rice-field in swampy ground, wet cultivation.\nrock and found to be $68^\\circ$ Fahrenheit. The temperature might, however, have been lowered by evaporation; therefore it can scarcely be assumed as a true mean temperature, or employed in calculating the height. It may, however, be remarked that the mean temperatures given by Mr. Leslie for the level of the sea in the different latitudes will certainly not apply to the low latitudes in the eastern islands: $83^\\circ$, which is given as the mean temperature in latitude 3, is far too high for Bencoolen, where the range of the thermometer throughout the year is usually from $74^\\circ$ to $85^\\circ$, rarely falling below $70^\\circ$ or rising above $87^\\circ$ or $88^\\circ$.\u00b9\n\nThe people who inhabit the interior are Rejangs, and speak a different language from the Malays; they extend northward as far as Laye. From the Sillebar\u00b2 river southward, the Serawi tribe prevails, and the space between that river and the Bencoolen is occupied by the tribe of Dua-blas. Similar customs, with slight shades of difference in each, prevail among all these tribes. At every village where the party stayed for the night, the gadises, or virgins, paid a visit of ceremony in the evening, making a present of betel or siri, and receiving some trifling articles in return. This custom is general, and it is necessary to be provided with a sufficiency of fans, looking-glasses, or such like articles in consequence, as the number of the young ladies is often very considerable. Sometimes an entertainment is given in honour of the visitors, and then all the beauty of the surrounding villages is also called in.\n\nThese entertainments, which take place also on occasions of marriages, &c., are not unamusing, and to a European have the additional interest of novelty and originality. They are given in the Balei, or public hall, a large building generally in the middle of the village, appropriated to such purposes and to the accommodation of strangers, &c. When European visitors are present, the ceremonial is generally as follows:\u2014The gentlemen being seated near the upper end of the room, the gadises, dressed out in their best attire, make their appearance about nine o\u2019clock, and seat themselves on the floor, previously spread with mats, in a semicircle, with their attendant matrons behind them; each brings her siri box of various material and elegance according to the rank or wealth of the parties. The chief of the village or one of the elders then makes an harangue in the name of the ladies, welcoming the strangers to their village, and concluding with the presentation of the betel. An appropriate answer is then to be made, and, after taking out the siri leaves, a small present is put into each box, proportioned in some degree to the rank of the parties; this, however, may be put off at pleasure till the conclusion. The amusements of the evening then commence, which\n\n\u00b9 This is almost identical with the Singapore temperature.\n\u00b2 That is Sal\u00e9bar or Sel\u00e9bar, from lobar, broad.\nconsist, on the part of the young people, of dancing and singing; and of the old, in smoking opium in a circle apart to themselves. The musical instruments are commonly kalingtangs, which are a species of harmonicon formed of a series of small gongs arranged on a frame.\\(^1\\) A space is cleared on one side for the dance, which is performed by five or six of the young gadises; the step is slow and sailing; the salindang,\\(^2\\) or scarf, is adjusted in a particular manner over the shoulders so that the ends may be taken in the hand, and the motions of the arms and management of the flowing scarf are not the least graceful part of the performance.\n\nThe singing of pantuns in alternate contest is an amusement which seems to be peculiar to the Sumatrans, and of which they are very fond. It may either be formally commenced by two parties, who seat themselves opposite to each other after having danced together, or it may be begun by one of the ladies from the place where she happens to sit. She begins a series of pantuns in a kind of recitative or irregular song; a bujang, or young man, answers her in the same manner, and the contest is kept up indefinitely, or until one of the parties is unable to give the proper answer. The girls and young men relieve each other occasionally as one or other happens to get tired.\n\nThe Malay pantuns, strictly so called, are quatrains, of which the first two lines contain a figure or image, and the latter give its point or moral. Sometimes the figure or comparison is accurately suited to the subject, and then the application may be omitted in recitation, the more to try the ingenuity of the respondent; sometimes the whole is couched under one or more figures; while in many the beginning seems only intended as a rhyme, or, at least, has not obvious connection with the subject.\\(^3\\) Among the Rejang and Serawi people a greater latitude is allowed to the seramba*\\(^4\\) or pantun, the figure is pursued to greater length, and a kind of measured prose is often employed in place of confining themselves to the trammels of verse. The pantun is frequently framed into a kind of riddle, whose meaning it requires some ingenuity to discover, and a blundering answer to which excites much mirth. These pantuns frequently contain words derived from the lan-\n\n\\(^1\\) On the same principle as the Javanese gambang, in which pieces of wood take the place of the glass in the harmonicon, ranged over a hollow case or trough.\n\n\\(^2\\) In the Straits selendang.\n\n\\(^3\\) In the majority of Peninsula pantuns no meaning is to be attached to the first two lines as far as any connection with the remaining two is concerned. [See H. N. van der Tuuk's \"Bataksch Leesboek,\" vol. iv. p. 107, ff.; and J. Pijnappel in \"Bijdragen\" for 1883, pp. 161-75.]\n\n\\(^4\\) [The scope of the serambahs is somewhat wider than that of the pantuns. They are called berditivi, when young people sitting in rows sing them in the daytime; begandai, when sung standing; and nyambri, when they are sung in the evening, sitting.

The origin of this distinction is referred to the period of the wars between Imbang Jaya, a Javanese prince, and Tuanko orang Muda of Menangkabau, the traces of the Sunda dialect marking the limit of the possessions of the former.\n\nIn these contests the pantuns are supposed to be extemporaneous effusions, and perhaps sometimes are so in reality, but in general their memories are so stored with established verses, that they are not often put to the task of invention. Of their force and meaning it is extremely difficult to convey a just idea by any translation: whoever has attempted to transfuse the spirit of an Oriental composition into a European language must have felt the difficulty of doing so satisfactorily, where the whole structure of the language is so different, and the whole current of ideas seems to flow in another channel. This is particularly the case with the pantun, whose chief merit consists in conciseness and point, and in conveying a deeper meaning than is contained in the literal words and expressions. The figures and allusions are often quaint, but occasionally evince a considerable degree of poetic feeling and force of imagination.\n\nIt is not only on these set occasions that pantuns are employed, they enter largely into their more common intercourse, and are essential accomplishments to all who aspire to a character of gallantry, or who hope to woo and win their lady's love. Skill and readiness in this kind of poetry is with them a passport to female favour, much in the same way that a readiness at compliment and flattery in conversation and the art of saying soft nothings serves the European candidate for the smiles of the fair; much of this kind of flirtation goes on independently of the open and public display of skill, and is often accompanied with the interchange of flowers and other mute symbols, which have all a mystic meaning intelligible to those who have been initiated into this secret mode of communication. Making due allowance for difference of customs, of wealth, and of progress in civilization, there seems to be much in the conduct of these entertainments and in the general deportment of the Sumatrans towards women to indicate that they possess somewhat of that character of romantic gallantry which marked our own earlier ancestors, and there might be found as much delicacy of feeling and perhaps more of the poetry of the passion in their courtships, than in the over-refinement of modern English society. It must also be remembered that no people can be more jealous of female honour than the Sumatrans, and that all this is conducted with a strictness of decorum far greater than is observed in the free intercourse permitted by European custom.\nA few examples of the different kinds of pantuns may not be unamusing, though it would be as difficult to convey an idea of the effect with which they are applied at the moment and on particular occasions, as to record the sallies and evanescent sparkles of wit that sometimes enliven our own tables, and which like the champagne that inspires them, would seem flat and dull if repeated next morning. Of the Malay pantun of four lines, several examples have been already given by Mr. Marsden, the strictness of their form and limits perhaps render them better suited to translation, but they are considered by the people of the interior as too stiff and prosaic and as deficient in that boldness of allegory and recondite allusion which they consider the perfection of their own longer ones. The following are specimens of the Malay pantun, applicable to different occasions, such as the opening of a courtship, complaints of inconstancy, coyness, &c., expressions of compliment, of affection, of doubt, of ridicule or displeasure, and others which the reader may much better imagine to himself than they can be explained by words. In some the connection of the figure and the sentiment will readily be perceived, in others it is obscure, particularly where the allusions are idiomatic or have reference to popular fables or belief, and in others there is none at all.\n\nMemuti\u00b9 umbak di rantau Kataun  \nPatang dan pagi tida berkala  \nMemuti bunga de dalam kabun  \nSa tangkei saja iang menggila.\n\n\"The waves are white on the shore of Kataun, night and day they do not cease to roll; many are the white flowers of the garden, but one alone hath made me distracted with love.\"\n\nGuruh berbuni\u00b2 sayup sayup  \nOrang di bunni samoa bembang;  \nJika ada angin bertiup  \nAda kah bunga mau kambang.\n\n\"The thunder rolls loud and deep, and the inhabitants of the earth are dismayed; if the zephyrs should now breathe upon it, will the flower expand its blossoms?\"\n\nAyer dalam bertambah dalam,  \nUjan di ulu bulum lagi tedoh;  \nHati dendam bertambah dendam,  \nDendam daulu bulum lagi sumboh.\u00b3\n\n\u00b9 In the following notes the common (Straits) Malay forms are referred to:\u2014m\u00e9mutih, from putih, white; patang.\n\u00b2 B\u00e1nyi; S\u00e1yup means primarily as far as the eye can see, or the ear can hear.\n\u00b3 S\u00e9mboh, cured.\n\"The deep waters have increased in depth, and the rain hath not ceased on the hills; the longing desire of my heart hath increased, and its former hopes have not yet been accomplished.\"\n\nParang bumban \\(^1\\) di sabrang,\nPohon di hela tiada karuan; \\(^2\\)\nBulan pernama niatalah bindrang,\nSayangnia lagi di saput awan.\n\n\"The reed is cut down on the other bank, it is now at the mercy of the stream, draw it towards you; the moon is at the full and shining, a cloud as yet intercepts her light (literally affection).\"\n\nUlak berulak batu mandi.\nKian berulak tenang jua; \\(^3\\)\nHindak bertunah tunah ati,\nDewa membawa bembang jua.\n\n\"The stream becomes still behind the sunken rocks, and the waters are smooth and calm amid the eddies; I try to quiet the uneasiness of my heart, but there is a fairy that still disturbs its peace.\"\n\nPermata jatu di rumput,\\(^4\\)\nJatu di rumput bergelang gelang;\nKasih umpama ambun di ujong rumput,\nDatang matahari nischaya \\(^5\\) ilang.\n\n\"The jewel fallen on the ground, though fallen among the grass, is glittering still, but thy love is like the dew on the flower,\\(^6\\) quickly disappearing when the sun comes forth.\"\n\nTelah lama tiada ka rimbo,\nBumban berbua garangan kini;\nTelah lama tiada bersuo,\nDendam berubah \\(^7\\) garangan kini.\n\n\"It is long since we have been to the forest, perhaps the bumban (a species of flowering reed) is now gone to fruit; it is long since we have met, perhaps thy affections are now estranged.\"\n\n---\n\n1 Bumban; this plant, except for its more branching character, somewhat resembles the bamboo.

The remaining\nand by far larger portion appears now for the first time in English; the trans-\nlation having been made by Mr. A. H. May, at the suggestion and expense of\nMajor-General Sir George le Grand Jacob, C.B., K.C.S.I., who is greatly\ninterested in Balinese literature, and has long been desirous of obtaining a copy\nof the Kavi Brahman\u00e7a-Pur\u0101\u1e47a, according to Dr. Friederich the only Pur\u0101\u1e47a\nknown to the Balinese.\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nI must request the indulgence of friendly readers for the following\npaper on Bali. Not having prepared myself for this labour on Bali\nitself, I had not the means of collecting and properly arranging all my materials. I could only use for this purpose a small portion of the valuable manuscripts of the priests which were placed at my disposal. I could not avail myself of the information of the natives as to many points, and I was deprived of a great part of my manuscripts. These circumstances will, perhaps, in some degree excuse the many deficiencies, best known to the writer, of this preliminary account. I have divided this work into three sections\u20141st, language and literature; 2nd, religion, worship and cremation; 3rd, castes and royal races. With this is given a short description of the Balinese calendar.\n\nIn the \"Tijdschrift voor Ne\u00earland's Indi\u00eb,\" IX. vol. iii. p. 340, an explanation from the Sanskrit is given of the name Bali in the paper Usana Bali: subsequently the title of a work, Bali Sangraha, became known to the writer. This work, which however appears no longer to exist, was presented by a pandita to one of the princes of Bali. The name is explained thus\u2014Bali = wis\u00ebsha, sangraha = kumpulan. Following the Indian manner of composition, where the word, which must be taken to be in the oblique case, is placed before that in the nominative, it is to be explained thus\u2014The gathering of the excellent (the heroes). With this the Sanskrit sangraha entirely agrees. Bali is then not to be considered as \"offering,\" but as the nominative of the theme balin, a strong person, powerful, a hero. The name Bali signifies, thus, a hero, and the name of the country given in Usana-Bali, Bali angka, \"the lap (birthplace) of heroes,\" is a very beautiful denomination of the holy land, and one which expresses the bold spirit of the nation.\n\nCrawfurd and Raffles first drew attention to the great importance of Bali in a religious and scientific respect. After their time little progress was made towards a knowledge of the island, and thus the Balinese (from their wanting that courtesy which the Javanese exhibit, which however only shows their submissive character) have been considered as a rude uncivilized people, from whose knowledge not much was to be expected. It cannot, indeed, be said, that the whole population of Bali, in arts (wherein they clearly are behind) or in science, stand above the Javanese, but the priests bring before our eye the stage at which the Javanese stood before the introduction of Muhammedanism. They are, also, the only remaining preserves of the old literature and religion. To them must every one repair who desires the elucidation of the Kavi. They are the expounders of all laws and institutions; and of the knowledge of antiquity they have scarcely lost or forgotten anything from their faithful adherence to traditions.\n\nShould circumstances permit, I hope, after some time, to follow up this preliminary account by an extended work on this remarkable island.\nLANGUAGE AND LITERATURE.\n\nThe language of Bali, like that of Java, is divided into a High and a Low, the first being spoken by the lower to the higher orders, and the last by the higher to the lower. The *High Language* is nearly pure Javanese, but it does not entirely agree with the present high Javanese. It possesses many words which now belong to the low tongue of Java, while other high Javanese words cannot be used in it without giving offence. It is thus easy for a Javanese to understand the high language of Bali, but he is not able to speak it with purity. The *Low Tongue*, on the other hand, has very little in common with the Javanese, and it agrees more with the Malayan and Sundanese, so that it is easily learned by men from Western Java. This language is that of the original inhabitants of Bali before the arrival of the Javanese. It has naturally undergone some changes, but, in general, we find in it a rude Polynesian dialect, which, in the recognized relationship of all these languages, agrees most with the least polished dialects, the Sundanese and original Malay; while it is far behind, and greatly differs from, the polished language of Java, which, in the course of more than a thousand years, has been brought to its refinement. On Bali, four hundred years ago, there were yet savages or half savages without a finely elaborated language. The same we may suppose to have been the case with the Malays before the reception of Muhammedanism, and with the Sundanese before the kingdom of Pajajaran came into existence. From this alone, that is, from the original relationship between all the languages from Sumatra to Bali and further to the east, which has been only distinctly preserved where the people have remained in a lower stage of civilization, we may explain the agreement between the low Balinese tongue and the Sundanese and Malay; an immigration of Sundanese or Malay into Bali is not at all to be thought of. The Javanese conquerors found this language the prevailing one on Bali, and could not expel it, and, for this reason in particular, that the population of Bali was very numerous, and was brought under subjection more by the greater civilization of the Javanese than by the force of arms. The Javanese conquerors preserved as a high language the Javanese which they brought with them; for their intercourse with the people of the land they had to learn the original Polynesian tongue, which alone was spoken by the former, and which, to this day, has a wider prevalence on Bali than the low language on Java. It is still\n\n1 [R. van Eck, \"Beknopte Handleiding bij de beoefening van de Balineseche taal,\" p. 1-8; H. N. v. d. Taak in \"Tijdschrift v. de taalkunde,\" vol. xxv. p. 245; Dr. Brandes, \"Vergelijkende Klankleer,\" p. 108-11.]\n\n2 [Here and in the sequel we should prefer the term \"Malayan.\"]\nexceedingly difficult for a common man to express himself intelligibly in the high language; and to speak to each rank of a higher or lower degree with full conformity to the laws of politeness, is an accomplishment which many even of the young princes have not attained. The agreement between the Balinese and the Sundanese does not confine itself to words alone. Both have also only 18 letters, while the Javanese possesses 20; these 18 were as much as the Polynesian organs originally required; the second \u1e0d and \u1e6d are properly foreign to these languages, and the distinct pronunciation which the Javanese give to them is not easily discriminated by the ear. Notwithstanding, these characters, as well as the capital letters, exist in the writing of the Balinese, but are only used to express the corresponding Sanskrit characters \u1e6d and \u1e0d or \u1e0dh (cerebral), in the same manner as the aksara murda or g\u2019d\u00e9, the capital letters of Cornets de Groot.\\(^1\\) Further, the Sundanese and Balinese agree in preserving the pure pronunciation of the vowel a in all cases where the Javanese corrupt it to o (\u00e2). The a is also in these languages, as in the Sanskrit, of far greater range and predominance than the other vowels. The only degeneration is to pepet \u00e9, and this may also be considered less as a short \u00e9 than a short ejaculated \u00e1, which is commonly used with a nasal sound following it (m or n and ng).\n\nThe language of Java must originally have possessed a closer relationship to the Balinese. This we conclude principally from the appearance of Malay, and also (according to Humboldt, vol. i. p. 198) of Tagala words, in the Kavi. At the period when the Kavi formed itself, the Javanese language could not yet have been so refined as it might have been if it had been formed in the course of ages in civilized Hindu States.\\(^2\\) The Malay words of the Kavi, which do not exhibit themselves in the present Javanese, are original Polynesian, and reveal to us the union which once existed between the languages of Sumatra, Western and Eastern Java, Bali, and probably all the Eastern islands, and which, chiefly, in the Eastern or proper Java alone, has been obscured by a higher civilization. The influence of the polished Javanese has also, it is true, made itself felt in the Sunda territories, but the high language of those parts is far less developed than that of Java; it probably first began with the establishment of the kingdom of Pajajaran; as on Bali with the arrival of the Javanese. On Bali the division into castes operated most, which rendered necessary a subordination in the manner of speaking also.\n\n\\(^1\\) [And of the subsequent authors of Javanese grammars, T. Roorda, J. J. de Hollander, Jansz, Halkema. The ten letters in question are called capital because they are substituted, except when final, for their equivalents in writing names of objects to which honour is due, such as deities, princes, &c.]\n\n\\(^2\\) [The results of the labours of V. der Tuuk, Kern, Brandes, and other savants tend to modify these conclusions; see the following notes.]\nthe Javanese, however, the language must have been rendered so complicated, since it was developed by them during more than a thousand years. A further knowledge of the languages east of Bali will probably still more confirm this position: *the languages of all these islands are dialects differing from each other, which have departed the less from the original parent the less and the later the people have received Hindu civilization.* Besides the spoken languages, we have on Bali the written language; this is in poems, with the exception of the more recent, the *Kavi*, and in the sacred writings of the priests, the Sanskrit.\n\nHumboldt (vol. i. pp. 188\u2013203) has written best on the origin of the Kavi language.\u00b9 Some modifications, however, in the conclusions of Humboldt must be introduced by the fact that pure Sanskrit writings are still found with the priests on Bali.\n\n*Kavi* is explained by Humboldt to be \"poetical language\" (*Kavi* \"a poet,\" *k\u0101vya* \"a poem\"). With this explanation that of the Balinese agrees; they say that *Kavin* or *Kakavin* signifies \"to make comparisons,\" \"to speak in comparisons.\" This is the mode in which poetry is formed; comparisons are the ornaments and marks of poetry. The explanation of the Javanese by *Khavi* (strong) scarcely needs to be mentioned. Khavi is an Arabic word; first known in Java in the Muhammedan era, and in Bali not at all. How could the Arabs have given the name to a language which they neither produced nor cultivated, but, on the contrary, have nearly destroyed, because it was the prop of Hinduism and of all the institutions on Java which the Arabs sought to overthrow and cast into oblivion? It is due to the Arabs and their followers that the Kavi is no longer understood on Java, and that Kavi works have nearly disappeared there, while an abundance of them has been carefully preserved on Bali. The verb *kavin* or *kakavin* has caused the works to which that name is applied by the Balinese to be regarded as marriage poems, because it reminds us of the Malay *kavin* (to marry). Both words, the Balinese and the Malayan, appear to be referable to the same Sanskrit word. From *kavya* by the suffixing of the Polynesian *an*, *kavyan* is formed; this, by the contraction of *ya* to *e* commonly (however improperly) used in Java, gives *kaven*; and from this, by a careless pronunciation with the common permutation of *e* and *i*, are formed *kavin* and *kakavin*. This is then at once the Balinese word for \"poetry\" and the Malay for \"to marry,\" because the marriage songs (*hymenaea*) form a principal part of the festivity, and that which most strikes the ear.\u00b2 Respecting the origin of the Kavi language, it would seem that\n\n\u00b9 [See the later contributions, ap. Brandes, l.l. p. 73 ff.]\n\u00b2 [It is obvious that the Malay and Javanese word *k\u0101vin*, marriage, to marry, which is a Persian loan word, has nothing but the sound in common\nsome new ideas must be kept in view. The priests did not hold the Kavi but the Sanskrit as the sacred language; this language is still found on Bali in the Vedas, the Brahmandaipurana and other mystic writings or tuturs [that is Sansk. tantra.\u2014Ed.]. We cannot therefore agree with Crawfurd, who considered that the Kavi was the language of the priests (Crawf. \u201cArch.\u201d vol. ii. pp. 17, 18).\n\nThe Hindus, and particularly the Hindu-Brahmans who came to Java, brought with them the Sanskrit in their sacred writings, and, perhaps, also a Prakrit dialect. That they knew and could speak a Prakrit dialect may be concluded from the comparatively late period of their arrival from India, which we place at the highest 500 years after Christ; at that time, however, the Sanskrit had been at least 800 years a dead language in India. On the other hand, against the idea, that they spoke Prakrit, pleads strongly the fact that we do not find a single Prakrit word in the Polynesian languages, that none of the assimilations, contractions and elisions which characterize the Prakrit appear in the Indian words of the Kavi; but it is this very fact which points the way to an explanation of the origin of the Kavi.\n\nIn the Sanskrit words on Java and Bali we find corruptions, which have not originated in an Indian mode. To this class belong the contraction of va to o, ya to e, the indistinct pronunciation, and the permutation thence arising, of u and o, of i and e; further the permutation of ra and re (kerret, formerly recognized by me as ri-vocalis), which however, as well as the preceding corruptions, never appear in good Balinese manuscripts. To this class belong also the corruption of the prefix pra into par and per; the omission of the initial a in Sanskrit words, for example nugraha for anugraha, which are interchanged with the non-significant initial letter a of Javanese verbs. The pronunciation of Anusv\u00e1ra as ng, e.g. in ong, should not be ascribed to a corruption; as this pronunciation appears to stand nearest to the unsettled sound of the Indian letter. The change of the Indian v to b in Byasa, Balmiki, Baruna, is to be considered less as a corruption than as an accommodation of the Sanskrit idiom for the preservation of the vocalic pronunciation. I, therefore, believe that the few changes in Sanskrit words have had their origin in Java, and that not a single Prakrit word has been introduced into the language of that island.\n\nThus the Hindu immigrants into Java, though they certainly spoke the Prakrit, as we must presume if we consider the time of their arrival, appear to have abandoned that language at once and adopted the dialect of the country. The reason for this must be sought in the circumstance of the Hindus arriving but in small numbers and finding a large population of natives; further, in\n\nwith the Old Javanese and Balinese word kawin, which is a poem framed after a Sanskrit original.]\ntheir being partly Buddhists, the adherents of which creed always adopted the manners and language of the nation to be converted, in the different countries into which they came. By the Buddhists the devotees of Brahma were likewise compelled to yield with regard to language, in order not to irritate the people whom they wished to subject to their own worship and institutions, and to give thereby full play to the Buddhists. Thus Buddhists and Brahmins lived together in Java on peaceful terms, and the worship of each became not indeed blended with, but augmented and modified by, the dogmas of the other. We have noticed this already on an earlier occasion when viewing the ruins of Prambanan and Boro Budo; in the course of this account more distinct proofs will be given of this hypothesis in different places. The Kavi works are written partly by \u015aiva\u00eftes, partly by Buddhists; both use the same dialect, and the works of both are held in high regard by the people, though the \u015aiva Brahmins of Bali appear to entertain a predilection for the genuine \u015aiva\u00eftish works.\n\nThose friendly relations appear to be one of the chief causes of the existence of the Kavi language. The introduction of a foreign language was not practicable on account of the Buddhists, and because the original population of Java was too large; still the necessity was felt of augmenting the dialect of the country in order to express, in the tracts written for the people, ideas relating to worship and science, for which no terms were then existing. In this way the people became accustomed to a number of Sanskrit words employed by their instructors in religion, and by gradually introducing more and more foreign words, a distinct language was formed, destined exclusively for writings and teaching. This language could not of course adopt the inflexion of the Sanskrit, for, in order to understand it, the people would have had to be made acquainted with the entire Sanskrit grammar, which would have been too troublesome for a nation like the Javanese to acquire, and moreover the imparting of it was not for the interest of the priests, whose secret writings, containing unadulterated Sanskrit forms, remained unintelligible for the rest of the people.\n\nThe fact that the Buddhists formed the Kavi without the introduction of words from the Prakrit, seems also to prove that their secret writings were in Sanskrit. In Ceylon and the further Indian Peninsula the books of the Buddhists were composed in Pali (a dialect of the Prakrit); but, in China and Tibet, in Sanskrit; the promulgation took place earlier in the northern parts than in those towards the south, and, for this reason, the books were still written in the ancient sacred language of all India. If, therefore, the Buddhists brought their books to Java composed in the Sanskrit language, their introduction must have been in a comparatively ancient time. It has been observed already that this newly\nformed dialect\\(^1\\) was chiefly intended for the converted people, while the priests preserved in the Sanskrit the religious books used by them alone (the Vedas), and whatever they wished to keep secret from the people (Brahm\u0101ndapur\u0101\u1e47a and the Tuturs).\n\nThe Kavi contained all those works by which the religious ideas and the cherished mythology of the priests were communicated to the people. It thus became a sacred language to the people, and the holiness attached itself to all the words, principally however to the Sanskrit, which were rendered conspicuous\\(^2\\) by capital letters (the aksara g'de or murda). For the priests of Bali this language is that of pleasure; they always use it for their poetical compositions; almost every one of them composes a poem of greater or less extent, which is communicated to their colleagues and scholars. But the Kavi is not sacred to them; they greatly distinguish between Kavi and \u015aloka. \u015aloka is the usual Epic measure of India, in which, in Bali, the Mantras (secret writings) and also the Vedas are written. The name Sanskrita, as significative of the language, is unknown in Bali. It is not even of a very old date in India, having come into use to contradistinguish it from the Pr\u0101k\u1e5bita, the vulgar language. \u015aloka (the measure used in the epic poems of India) is used at present in Bali as the denomination of the works composed in that measure, the language of which is Sanskrit. Those are sacred and must be kept hidden from the people (rahasya). The Kavi has various epochs; in the opinion of the Balinese there are three principal ones, viz.:\n\n1. The epoch of Ayer Langgia; in the compositions of his age, according to the Siva Brahmans, the Kavi appears in the most beautiful and oldest form. He reigned in Kediri, and was one of the ancestors of Jayabaya. In his time the worship of Siva seems to have been predominant.\n\n2. The epoch of Jayabaya; of his time is the Barata Yudda, less esteemed than, for instance, the Viv\u0101ha, and indeed of a more recent style, also many works of Buddhist authors. His period cannot be ascertained from the Balinese records: according to them he reigned in Barata Varsa (India), but this is the India transferred by the Barata Yudda into Java. His period would appear to comprise the reigns of several rulers, since so many works are ascribed to him.\n\n3. The epoch of Majapahit, where we meet with still greater admixtures of the vulgar language, and less acquaintance with the riches of the Sanskrit. This period is succeeded by a fourth one, formed by the continued poetical compositions of the priests and of some princes in Bali. These, at least the priests, have preserved the knowledge of the Kavi, and even augmented it by new\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) [On the nature of Kavi and the position it holds with regard to Javanese, see the note to V. d. Tuuk's article \"On Malagasy,\" and the references.]\n\n\\(^2\\) [See, concerning the term \"capital,\" the note above at p. 72.]\nSanskrit expressions, which they take from the secret writings. From this we are inclined to trace their immigration into Bali, and the large stock of knowledge they are still in possession of, to another part of Java, perhaps Kediri, and not to Majapahit. The tale of \u015aiva Brahmans having come to Majapahit from India shortly before the destruction of that empire is altogether unknown in Bali. How is it, moreover, possible that those Brahmans should have acquired so speedily the knowledge of the Kavi and of the native language? The priests of Bali have been in Majapahit, how long is uncertain; but they descended from Kediri, and from thence probably it was that they brought their greater knowledge. These accounts can be brought into accordance with the account in question of the arrival of \u015aiva Brahmans at Majapahit, if we here, likewise, bear in mind the transfer of Baratavarsa into Java,\u2014Kediri with its king Jayabaya lay in Baratavarsa; Majapahit seems not to have been comprised in it.\n\nThe literature of Bali from its nature is divisible into\n\n1. Sanskrit works, with Balinese paraphrase; they include the Vedas, the Brahmanda-purana, and the greatest part of the Tuturs.\n\n2. Kavi works: (a) the epics sacred to the people, viz., the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a, Uttarak\u0101nda and the Parvas:\u2014(b) the lighter Kavi poetry, as the Viv\u0101ha, Barata Yudda, &c.\n\n3. Javanese-Balinese compositions, written partly in the native measures (Kidung), such as Malat; partly in prose, as the historical narratives Kenhangrok, Rangga Lave, Usana, Pameudanga.\n\nSome of the works in prose, especially the law-books, cannot be classed in the third category; they exhibit the ancient language strongly intermixed with Sanskrit, yet they cannot be called Kavi works, from the absence of measure, and this alone is the characteristic of the Kavi language. From this also the poetical language is determined.\n\nTo the accents which are used in the writings of Bali (vid. \u201cTijdschrift\u201d IX. vol. iii. pp. 254\u201356) must here be added a sign for the long \u016b differing from the ordinary Suku, and everywhere used in good manuscripts, where the Sanskrit exhibits the long \u016b. This long \u016b is called Suku ilud, and according to this, \u201cTijd.,\u201d ib., p. 255, l. 3, is to be corrected; the k\u0113r\u0113t (ri-vocalis) is called Guung mak\u0113r\u0113t (Guung is chakra, mak\u0113r\u0113t, joined to k\u0113r\u0113t). The long \u012b, with a small point in the common figure, is called ulu mijia. The Balinese have very indistinct notions respecting long and short vowels; however, they, at least the learned priests, use the long \u012b, the long \u016b, and the t\u0113dung as signs for the long \u0101, precisely following the tradition where they must stand according to the Sanskrit.\n\nThe priests are also in possession of a work on the euphonic laws, called Sroyanchana.\n\nIn earlier accounts it has been noticed that in Bali no inscrip-\ntions on stone or metal are met with, nor any older characters than the present current writing. This is naturally explained from the letters only having been introduced since the fall of Majapahit or a very little before. Although we meet with no modes of writing of a more ancient date, yet in the new writing all the richness is preserved which ever was possessed by the Sanskrit writing in Java. It is only in the Balinese manuscripts that we find reproduced, with the greatest purity, the numerous signs of the Sanskrit, which were superfluous and unpronounceable in Polynesian idioms. Nearly all doubt which may be entertained of the proper powers of the Sanskrit letters, as they have been received in Java and Bali, will be removed by the examination of the writing of such manuscripts as the Vritta Sanjaya, and principally of the numerous Sanskrit words occurring there; any possible faults will be corrected and excused by those who are conversant with the subject, if they consider the many transcriptions of such manuscripts which are made in Bali, and how easily some corruptions and inaccuracies might find their way into them among a small nation, shut out from the source of their civilization, and for 400 years dependent on themselves.\n\nSacred Writings newly Discovered.\n\nThe first rank in the Balinese literature, as in that of the Hindus, is occupied by the Vedas. According to the communications of the priests, they are not complete in Bali, but only fragments, although, to judge from appearance, tolerably large ones, of all the four Indian Vedas\u2014viz., 1, of the Rig-Veda; 2, Yajur-Veda (commonly inaccurately spelt Yayur Veda); 3, Sama-Veda; 4, Artava-Veda (a corruption caused merely by the transposition of the r, easily explained by the mode of writing the Indian-Balinese r above the line; the Indian name is Atharva-Veda). The author of the Vedas is Bagav\u00e1n Byasa (Vy\u00e1sa in India).\n\nThe Vedas contain the formulas of prayer as well for the private worship of the Panditas, performed in their houses, as for the feasts, great offerings and cremations of the people, when the Panditas mumble them inwardly. They are a mystery to all except the Brahmans, and the Panditas instruct the younger Brahmans in them in secret. The metre appears to be the epic Sloka, as further illustrated in the Article on Metre, and the language a pure Sanskrit. From their being written wholly in Slokas, we may suppose either that the Vedas were brought into that metre in ancient times, and in that form introduced into Java and Bali, or that the knowledge of forming Slokas existed in Java. If the names of the Vedas were not well known, I should rather incline to suppose that they never had been in possession of the genuine Vedas, since in India the metre of the Vedas is guarded\nby ample commentaries, and must be regarded as an integral and sacred part of those ancient scriptures. The whole of the Brahm\u0101ndapur\u0101\u1e47a has been communicated to me on the condition of my not making any uninitiated person acquainted with it. In the same way, I may hope to obtain, also, further information about the rest of the mystic writings, and about the Vedas themselves.\n\nThe Vedas have also been in Java, since the priests of Bali are of Javanese derivation and had their abode in Kediri and Majapahit. Any direct arrival of Brahmans from India is not known in Bali, and even the immigrants into Majapahit, shortly after the destruction of that empire, appear not to have adopted the Vedas of India but of Java, and it is even doubtful whether they arrived directly from India, or only from some other part of Java, since the Panditas know nothing of such an arrival from India, while they nevertheless trace their genealogy through Kediri to India. From the tenor of the Brahm\u0101ndapur\u0101\u1e47a in Bali we may draw conclusions as to the character of the Vedas. The genuine Indian pieces in the Vedas, which appear to be written in \u015alokas, are, probably, accompanied by a Balinese or Kavi comment, which, after the lapse of some time, became necessary even for the priests, in order not to lose the true sense of the original texts.\n\nIt is an object of the greatest importance to get possession of the remains of the Vedas in Bali. The religion can only by their means become thoroughly intelligible; they further give the standard for the determination of the state of Hinduism when it spread to the islands, and, if compared with the antiquities of India, especially through a more intimate knowledge of the history of the Vedas in that island, will be of service in ascertaining the age from which the Indian influence, and the civilization of Polynesia consequent on it, may be dated. Surya-sevana (worship of the sun) signifies not only the religion of the priests, but also the book containing those parts of the Vedas which are used for that worship. I saw the outside of the manuscript; it contained about eighty lontar-leaves. In respect of contents the Brahm\u0101ndapur\u0101\u1e47a come nearest to the Vedas; it is also called shortly Brahm\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da. We find in India eighteen Pur\u0101\u1e47as, among which is the Brahm\u0101ndapur\u0101\u1e47a. These eighteen are the sacred writings of all the different Indian sects. Six are especially holy to the votaries of Vishnu, six others to those of \u015aiva, and six keep the mean. The more special sects have embraced chiefly one Pur\u0101\u1e47a, as representing the abstract of their worship, as the worshippers of Krishna the Bh\u0101gavata-pur\u0101\u1e47a. In this way it is easily explained how, in Bali, the Brahm\u0101ndapur\u0101\u1e47a only should be in use, and how the Panditas should not have preserved even the slightest recollection of the other seventeen Pur\u0101\u1e47as, so little indeed that the names mentioned by me were altogether unknown to them. We\nfind in Bali but one \u015aivaitic sect, and the adherents of it have acknowledged the Brahmanda pur\u0101\u1e47a, perhaps already in India, as the only book of instruction. The Pur\u0101\u1e47as are, as we know, the sacred books of the sectaries, and the priests in India did not trouble themselves much with the sects and their controversies, but, adhering to the more purified worship of the Veda, held the religion of the other people in contempt. Hence it is that the Pur\u0101\u1e47as in India are, chiefly, in the hands of the people. In Bali, on the contrary, they are guarded by the priests like the whole of the holy scriptures, and even hid from the people. In Bali, everything relating to religion is in the hands of the priests, and on the great ignorance of the people in all that is necessary according to the sacred literature for their temporal and celestial happiness, is founded the unlimited power of the priests, who are the organs of the Deity for the blindly believing people.\n\nThe contents of the Brahmanda pur\u0101\u1e47a are: the creation, the ancestors of the world under the various Manus, the description of the world according to Indian notions, the history of the ancestors of old dynasties, besides mythology and mythic chronology; it is composed by Bagav\u0101n Vy\u0101sa (the holy Vy\u0101sa). He is also known in India as the author of the Vedas, of all the Pur\u0101\u1e47as and of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata; his name signifies [expansion, amplification, in contradistinction to sam\u0101sa, i.e.] composition, and Prof. Lassen is of opinion that it is a personification of the recension of those holy writings. (In what period did this take place?) It is worthy of remark, however, that in Bali he (as the compiler of the said works), as well as V\u0101lmiki, the author of the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a, are known, since from this we may complete the traditions from India.\n\nThe Brahmanda pur\u0101\u1e47a is written in \u015alokas like the Indian Pur\u0101\u1e47as; and it is to be lamented that we cannot get possession of the Indian Brahmanda pur\u0101\u1e47a; a comparison of both of them would furnish us with a large amount of revelations on the progress of the literature, as well as on the relation of the Balinese to the original Indian worship. The \u015alokas seldom follow each other unbroken; generally, we meet with only a fourth or the half of a \u015aloka, followed by an extended paraphrase in the Balinese language. Under the head of Religion we shall give a few examples.\n\n**Epic Poetry.**\n\n*R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a.*\u2014This is the oldest Indian epos, composed by V\u0101lmiki, who is also in Bali acknowledged as the author of it. Here, however, it exists as a Javanese elaboration by Mpu Raja Kusuma, also called Jogisvara, or prince of the penitents, father of Mpu (Hempu) Tanakung and of another poet Mpu Dharmaja, composer of the Svaradahana. The language is pure Kavi, with\na peculiarly large number of Sanskrit words. The Indian R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a contains seven K\u0101\u1e47\u1e0das, large divisions, again divided into Sargas, chapters; in Bali we find no K\u0101\u1e47\u1e0das, but the whole narrative of the first six K\u0101\u1e47\u1e0das is placed together and divided into twenty-five Sargas.\\(^1\\) The 7th, the Uttara K\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da, is no part of the narrative, but forms a separate work in Bali, the author of which, however, is accounted to be the same V\u0101lmiki. The separation of this K\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da from the rest of the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a is a proof that it was introduced from India as a different piece, not forming part of the large work, in favour of which position the contents also speak, the Uttara K\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da giving an account of the history of the family of R\u0101ma after his death. From this we conclude that in India, at the period when the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a was communicated to the Javanese, the Uttara K\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da was not yet annexed to this work. We, likewise, do not find, in the Java-Balinese R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a, the long stories of the B\u0101la K\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da, the history of R\u0101ma as a child, where Vasista, the priest of the house, tells him tales of the time of old. Those narratives, partly very beautiful, such as that of the Sag\u0101rides and the descent of the river-goddess Gang\u0101 on the earth (vide A. W. von Schlegel's \"Indische Bibliothek\"), are episodes not forming part of the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a; they have, however, so many charms, especially for a people like the Javanese and Balinese, who take every story for truth, that the absence of those tales in the Java-Balinese R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a is surprising. We ascribe their absence to the same reasons as the separation of the Uttara K\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da from the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a; at the time when the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a found its way into Java, it was not so voluminous as at present in India, and comprised exclusively the history of R\u0101ma. As to the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, it has long since been discovered by European scholars from the contents, and the form of different parts, that in this work, as it at present exists, we have before us a conglomerate of Indian myths, which have been interpolated, partly in recent times. The same seems to be the case with the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a, though the interpolations are not met with so repeatedly, and are not spread through the whole work. For a careful critical comparison of the Indian R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a with that of Bali I am at present in want of an edition of the Indian one. In Java, up to this time, there is only known a Javanese elaboration of the Kavi composition, the Romo; this is far behind the Balinese Kavi work both in language and style, and is looked upon by the Balinese as a corruption. The Romo probably was not composed until the Muhammedan era, and probably when, on the cooling of the religious zeal, the beautiful ancient literature was still remembered, while the knowledge of the Kavi was forgotten.\n\nI have borrowed a good manuscript of the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a from the highest and most learned priest in Badong, the Padanda Made\n\n\\(^{1}\\) [Kern, in \"Bijdragen\" for 1883, i. p. 1.]\nALENG KACHENG in Teman Intaran. It contains the R\u00e2m\u00e2yana complete on 210 lontar-leaves, and is written very fairly, with great care in the use of uncommon signs, and with attention to the euphonic laws. Of this manuscript the last leaf with the signature is wanting, so that it cannot be ascertained how old it is. For my use the little that was deficient has been transcribed from the text of another manuscript. This latter was written in the year (of \u0160aka) 1693, corresponding to the year of Christ 1771; and in Bali at Bandharapura (the Sanskrit name of Badong). Badong signifies as well the small kingdom of that name, as the residences of the princes of Badong, situated at no great distance from each other. We may translate Bandharapura, \u201cthe town of union,\u201d or \u201cthe united palaces of the princes,\u201d pura meaning a town and a royal palace. The Balinese word badong has also the same meaning. It is written with alpas\u00e2stra (small letters), which makes us think of capital (Kavi and Sanskrit) letters. The usual Balinese letters may indeed be said to be small ones (alpa), if compared with old writings still existing in Java. However, we find no other letters in Bali than the common recent current writing, and even the learned priests have lost every recollection of more ancient letters. Inscriptions on stone (as noticed already) are not found, and the letters of the Sanskrit shown by me to them were perfectly unknown to them. We can thus make nothing more of alpas\u00e2stra than that the writer humbly acknowledges that he makes use of the imperfect letters, since the want of greater knowledge does not permit him to write better and more correctly.\n\nThe last words contain an invocation of the Deity, and we find them with slight variations at the end of several manuscripts; they are pure Sanskrit, and correspond to the invocations at the beginning of Sanskrit works: Siddir astu, tatastu, ong Sarasvati namah, ong t'mung Ganapataye namah, ong sri Gurubyo namah, \u201cBe this the accomplishment, be it thus (?) : Ong adoration to Sarasvati, Ong adoration to Ganapati, Ong to the gurus adoration!\u201d The word t'mung is not very clear nor Sanskrit. The invocation of tat-astu (let this be) appears also superfluous; if we explain it by tath\u00e0 astu (may it be), the sense becomes no better. Sarasvati is the goddess of letters, the consort of Brahm\u00e0. In every Balinese year she has a feast, where the whole of the manuscripts are brought forth and consecrated in the temple. Ganapati or Ganesa, the son of \u0160iva and Parvati, is the god of arts and cunning, the Indian Mercury. His cunning is invoked in India as well as on Bali, in order to overcome the obstacles which are likely to be met with in the composition of an important work. The gurus are on earth the parents and spiritual teachers; here, however, are meant the celestial gurus, the Pitaras, or \u201cspirits of the departed members of the family,\u201d who receive a daily worship.\n\nThe R\u00e2m\u00e2yana is divided into twenty-five sargas or chapters. It begins with the incarnation of the god Vish\u1e47u in the family of the\nking Dasarata of Ayodhya (the present Oude); he becomes the son of Dasarata by his wife Kosalya (Sanskrit Kau\u015baly\u0101); his half brothers are Barata by Kekayi and Laksmana by Sumitra. His teacher is the Muni Vasista, who instructs him above all in the Danurveda, \"the art of arms.\" At an early age, the pious king Visvamitra, the rajarsi, royal rishi (vide the Rajarsis in Bali, his successors), when he was recognized as an incarnation of Vishnu, invoked his aid to deliver his hermitage from the Rakshasas who had made war against it. This he accomplished, and bent the bow of Parasu R\u0101ma. From this the tale turns to his nuptials with the fair Sita, and to the intrigues of his stepmother Kekayi, who forms the design to raise her son to the throne. After that he voluntarily retires into a hermitage, and subsequently into the forest of Dandaka, accompanied by Sita and Laksmana. Laksmana mutilates the Rak\u1e63asi Surpanaka who wooed for his love, and by this excites the hatred of R\u0101vana, the prince of Langka (Ceylon), and brother to Surpanaka, against R\u0101ma and his companions. R\u0101vana ravishes the beautiful Sita, and R\u0101ma seeks for her in vain. He makes an alliance with the monkey-king Sugriva, and his son the swift Hanuman. Hanuman discovers the hidden spot where Sita was concealed, and then begins the war of R\u0101ma and his monkey-warriors against the Rak\u1e63asas of Langkapura. A large part of the work is filled with instructive conversations between the monkey-princes and R\u0101ma, and their relations, especially between Vibisana, the brother of R\u0101vana, and the latter. Finally R\u0101vana is slain by R\u0101ma, who with his supernatural weapon chakra cuts off his ten heads. Sita is purified by Agni (the god of the fire), and disappears in mother earth. R\u0101ma becomes king of Ayodhya, and retires in old age to the forest hermitage, where he dies.\n\nThe R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a and the Parvas are to the Balinese a sort of pattern for princes. The adat of the princes, and of the second and third castes, is contained in those works, holy to them, whilst the Vedas and other secret writings furnish the rules for the Brahmins. The princes and the chiefs of Bali are to regulate their lives in accordance with the Epic writings, and as long as they do so peace and quietness shall prevail and increase in the country. In the present time, however, many princes are charged with indifference to the sacred precepts, and with being, thereby, the cause of the diminution of the fortune and prosperity of Bali. A virtuous prince, before undertaking the smallest matter, examines first the conduct of the old Kshatriyas and demigods, as it is described in the ancient holy literature. The conduct of those ancient heroes is ever in the recollection of the princes of to-day, in order to regulate their actions according to the holy patterns, wherever they may find themselves.\n\nA king is to have the accomplishments of the eight gods of the points of the compass\u2014viz., Indra, Yama, Surya, Chandra,\nAnila, Kuvera, Baruna, Agni (according to R\u00e2m\u00e2yana, lontar-leaf 181).\n\nUttarak\u00e2nd\u00e2.\u2014This, as we have seen, is the last (seventh) division of the Indian R\u00e2m\u00e2yana. The author is likewise Balmiki (V\u00e2lm\u00eeki). Up to this time I have not had access to it; it is, however, the history of the brothers of R\u00e2ma, and contains also stories altogether unconnected with the family of R\u00e2ma. A more recent Kavi work is the Arjuna-vijaya, which borrows its subject from the Uttarak\u00e2nd\u00e2; of which hereafter. K\u00e2nd\u00e2 (compare the \"K\u00e2nd\u00e2\" of Raffles, vol. i. p. 373 et seq.), division in India, is used in Bali like Parva for all sacred writings; those Kavi works, however, whose names are K\u00e2nd\u00e2 and Parva, are chiefly destined for the princes and nobles of the second and third caste in Bali, whilst the works written in Slokas are confined as holy to the priests and Brahmans. The R\u00e2m\u00e2yana and the Parvas (of the Mah\u00e2bh\u00e2rata) have not been long known to the whole people; they were a secret of the priests and chiefs, and contain rules for the latter in their government and for every action during their temporal life. In every undertaking and in every event, persons of rank are bound to conduct themselves in accordance with the precepts contained in those works. Contempt or indifference in following those sacred writings would bring disaster on princes and people alike, and the entire happiness of the country is indissolubly dependent on the imitation of those holy works.\n\nParvas (of the Mah\u00e2bh\u00e2rata).\u2014The second great Indian epos is the Mah\u00e2bh\u00e2rata, composed by the Muni Vyasa (Bal. Byasa). The name of Mah\u00e2bh\u00e2rata is not known in Bali, but its eighteen divisions or Parvas are known. The names of those eighteen are correct. Six exist entire and two are incomplete. From the name of Mah\u00e2bh\u00e2rata being unknown, it would appear that this work at the time it was brought from India to Java did not bear this name, nor perhaps any general name at all, but that its divisions were already regarded as sacred writings. In that case, the name Mah\u00e2bh\u00e2rata is only applicable to a small part of the whole work, since the war of the Bharatas, that is, of the Pandavas and Kurus, occupies not more than 20,000 Slokas, whereas the whole work contains above 100,000. The rest consists of interpolated narratives of various descriptions, which, as occasion admits, are inserted loosely or annexed. How much the Balinese Parvas did contain of the Indian ones, it is impossible for me to decide, without being in possession of the Indian Mah\u00e2bh\u00e2rata; the pieces contained in them stand, however, in high esteem, and are faithfully copied. They have:\n\n1 Ad\u00eeparva\n2 Virataparva\n3 Bismaparva\n4 Musalaparva\n5 Prastanikaparva\n\n6 Svarga-Rawanaparva and parts of\n7 Udyoga Parva and\n8 Asramawasoparva.\nThe names of the remaining ten they give as follows:\n\n9 Saba Parva.\n10 Aranyak Parva\n11 Drona Parva\n12 Karna Parva\n13 Salya Parva\n\n14 Gada Parva\n15 Svata Parva\n16 Soptika Parva\n17 Str\u012bpalapa Parva\n18 Asvamedhayajnya Parva.*\n\nAlong with them they mention also the Santika-parva, although they expressly said there existed no more than eighteen Parvas: this can, therefore, be nothing but another name for one of the above eighteen Parvas. Vy\u0101sa, the author, whom we have already mentioned in speaking of the Brahmandapur\u0101na, is the son of Parasara, the grandson of Sakri, who is the son of Vasista, the domestic priest in Ayodhya, teacher of Rima, and supposed progenitor of one of the most distinguished castes of the Brahmans. This family was nearly extirpated through Sakri, the son of Vasista, being devoured by one of the Raksasas. Vasista was ready to immolate himself by the flames, but was prevented on hearing from out of the womb of the mother, the cries of his grandson, who afterwards was called Parasara. He then resolved to spare his life for the education of the child. Upon this he performed his domestic worship, and while muttering the Veda a fire broke out, into which all the Raksasas were drawn down by an irresistible force and destroyed. This furnished the subject of a painting in the private temple of the r\u0101j\u0101 Kassiman of Gunong Rata, where we see the holy Vasista performing his worship in the manner still observed to-day by the Panditas, and hosts of Raksasas, by the power of his words, falling into the self-existent fire.\n\nThe Balinese maintain that the family of Vasista lived in Baratavars (the eldest holy name of the Brahmanical India, which, however, comprised only a part of the valley of the Ganges between Ganga and Jamuna). Vy\u0101sa, the writer, is also called Hempu or M'pu Yogisvara. This is a name of frequent occurrence, and signifies even the highest divinity Siva. It is, however, explainable by the fact that a saint or Padanda, who retires from the world, becomes identified with the Deity, and is himself called Siva. In a certain sense, the Deity is himself the author of all the holy scriptures, since he enters into the composer and speaks and acts by him.\n\n* These are, especially, the works whose deficiency the Brahmans, who spoke with Crawfurd, regretted. They requested me to communicate them to them, which I did as far as my pieces extended, with the promise to provide, also, the large remaining part. The Indian books themselves are of no use to them, since they do not know the writing. I was thus obliged to dictate them word by word.\n\n[See, on this specification, Weber in his \"Indische Studien,\" vol. ii. pp. 136-9. Also van der Tuuk, \"Notes on the Kawi Language and Literature,\" (1881), p. 7; and Kern, \"Over de Oudjavaansche Vertaling van't Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata,\" (Amsterdam, 1877), pp. 2-4].\nThe *Bismaparva* contains 102 lontar-leaves. The *Adiparva* is nearly of the same size. The *Prastanika-parva*, which I saw, contained only sixteen lontar-leaves, but was not complete. The names are all Indian ones with the exception of *Svatamaparva*, which seems to be a corruption of *Asvatth\u00e2mmaparva*, thus called after a hero of the *Mah\u00e2bh\u00e2rata*, a son of Drona. *Str\u00eepalapa-parva* is called in the Sanskrit only *Str\u00eeparva*; *palapa* seems to be formed in the Polynesian manner from *alapa* (harangue).\u00b9 The language of the *Parvas* is, like that of the *R\u00e2m\u00e2yana*, pure *Kavi*, and more difficult to be understood than the other important *Kavi* works. In addition we have a *Kap\u00eeparva*, containing the history of *Sugriva*, *Hanuman* and their ancestors in the monkey-dynasty. There exist also the *Chantaka* or *Khelaka-Parva*; this is a sort of dictionary, where all the synonyms are classed together after the manner of the Javanese *dasanaina*; it was compiled by Kavidasi, the follower of By\u00e2sa; it commences with the numerous denominations of the gods, and is for that reason of great importance for the mythology. It is, however, written in prose, and, like the *Kaviparva*, strongly separated from the eighteen holy *Parvas*. An *Agasti* (or *Auggasti*) *Parva* came also to my knowledge, in which the holy *Agasti* (the star *Canopus* and leader of *R\u00e2ma* in his campaign against the south of India) gives instruction to his son *Dredasya*; this work is not to be confounded with the *Parvas* of the *Mah\u00e2bh\u00e2rata*.\n\nTo the ancient Indian literature pertain further the books of the laws, especially that of Manu. The Balinese law-books are, likewise, drawn from them, although they are written neither in *Slokas* nor in *Kavi*, and we shall, therefore, speak of them after the *Kavi* literature. The original law-book of *Manu*, *M\u00e2navadharma-s\u00e2stra*, is not known in Bali either by that name or by that of *Menava S\u00e2stra* (as the name is said to be on Bali by Raffles, vol. i. p. 991). *Prabu Manu*, however, is mentioned as the founder of the law, and the Indian origin of the Balinese law and law-books is thus certain. The *Pur\u00fbd\u00eegama* or *Siva S\u00e2sana*, especially, is said to have *Manu* for its author. *(Vide infra.)*\n\n**Common Kavi Literature.**\n\n1. **B\u00e2rata Yudda.**\u2014With respect to its contents, the B\u00e2rata Yudda stands nearest to the Parvas. For a considerable time it has been regarded as the only version of the Indian Mah\u00e2bh\u00e2rata in our islands. But we have now found on Bali the original pieces of that epos. The B\u00e2rata Yudda is formed after four of the Parvas\u2014viz., after the *Bisma*, *Drona*, *Karna*, and *Salya-Parva*; the author is *Hempu* (or *M'pu*) *S'dah*, who lived in the time of *Sr\u00ee Paduka Bat\u00e2ra Jayabaya*, Prince of Kediri, and wrote his works.\n\n\u00b9 [Or, rather, to be a corruption of *pral\u00eepa*.]\nby the order of the latter; the design of the Prince was to obtain by the composition of the work a kadigjayan, a subjugation of the world. In this also an Indian idea is conspicuous; by the performance of great offerings, by sumptuous works of architecture, and by works of literature, the prince thus engaged becomes not only famous, but he also acquires extraordinary power, by which he is enabled to subject the universe to his will. Such was also the aim of the great offering of the prince of Lombok (in September, 1846), who, not being recognized by all as the legitimate chief, sought, by offerings and abundant alms, to prove his royal right and to strengthen himself for warlike enterprises. The time at which the manuscript of which I made use was composed is the year of Saka 1724 (corresponding to the year of Christ 1802). To judge from its outward appearance, I should have taken it to be much older; in forty-six years the lontar-leaves have already become much injured, and it seems to prove what is said, also, of Indian manuscripts, that they cannot survive a hundred years. This, probably, is also one of the causes that in Java, in so short a time, almost the whole of the ancient literature was lost, and that, when the desire for the old literature was revived, hardly any of the old manuscripts could be discovered. In Bali, also, we must not look for very old manuscripts; however, those which are guarded and transcribed in the families of the priests may almost be considered as original, since in these families the knowledge of language and religion is preserved with the minutest care. Some faults are, of course, also possible here.\n\nThe place where the manuscript was written is Svechchanagara, also called nagari Sukavati, situated in the kingdom of Gyanyar. I have noticed above that Badong has also a Sanskrit name (Bandanapura); this is the case with all distinguished places in Bali; this place has even two nearly accordant Sanskrit names. Sukavati is the city abounding in pleasure; Svechcha-nagara, the city of well-being. We perceive here, again, how far the Indian element, and thereby the Indian language, has penetrated into Bali. However, all those places have also Polynesian names for the populace\u2014the Sanskrit ones are frequently known to the princes and priests only.\n\nThe name B\u00e2rata Yudda was formerly translated \"penance, combat,\" and commonly written Br\u00e2t\u00e2 Yudda; brata (Ind. vrata) is penance, and the heroes of the combat acquiring perfection by penance, the explanation had appearance in its favour. But we find in the manuscripts of the priests of Bali constantly B\u00e2rata Yudda, with the capital b (according to De Groot), corresponding to the Sanskrit bh, and followed by the t'dung (or tarung), representing the long \u00e1; the name cannot, therefore, be brought into accordance with brata, which originated in vrata. B\u00e2rata, as we find it written, signifies, however, \"a descendant of Bharata\" (the\nold Indian ruler of the universe), and we have thus in our work \"the combat of the descendants of Bharata.\" Now the Kurus and the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas are descendants of that ruler, and nothing can be more appropriate than such a title for the work. This explanation has already been offered by Raffles, but the reasons which render it irrefutable we first learned from the good Balinese manuscripts.\n\nThe conclusion of this work agrees much with that of the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a, and is Sanskrit: Ong sri devyeyo namah, ong t'mung Ganapateye namah, ong siddha astu, tat-astu hastu, ong dirgayur astu. \"Ong adoration to the happy gods! Ong adoration to Ganapati! Ong may the accomplishment be, may that be! Ong, may there be long life!\" Devyeyo must be devebyo. What gods, however, are meant is not clear. Sarasvat\u012b and Gane\u015ba cannot be intended, since the latter is invoked separately; tat-astu is here made more forcible by the addition of another astu; the word t'mung here likewise precedes Ganapati. Dirgayus, \"long life,\" is a thing for which the Indians and Balinese, and especially the composers of literary works, always supplicate the Deity. It is not necessary to draw the attention of those who are acquainted with Sanskrit to the inflected Sanskrit forms, and to the proper observance of the difficult euphonic laws of that language, occurring here and at the conclusion of the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a. In an enumeration of the Kavi works of a less sacred character, the B\u0101rata Yudda is placed at the head, because the contents are closely connected with the holy Parvas. It stands, however, in less esteem, and is more recent than some other Kavi works\u2014e.g., the Viv\u0101ha. The language is also not a very pure Kavi, but more intermixed with the common bh\u0101s\u0101.\n\n2. Viv\u0101ha.\u2014This is known from the Javanese paraphrase of Gericke, published in the twentieth volume of the \"Transactions of the Batavian Society.\" The contents and arrangement of the narrative in the Kavi Viv\u0101ha is the same as in the translated paraphrase. The language is a very pure and beautiful Kavi; it is likewise not composed in the common Javanese song-form, but in the metres derived from India (to be afterwards described). The author is \u1e28'pu Kanva, not Kanno, as we find in the Javanese Viv\u0101ha, which word has been formed by the usual Javanese corruption of va into o. Kanva is the name of an Indian Muni or Saint. Our Kanva, however, we may be sure, was a Javanese, perhaps of an Indian descent. He, too, lived in Kediri under Ayer Langgia, the ancestor of Jayabaya.\n\nHempu S'dah and Hempu Kanva seem to have been adherents of the \u015aivaitic sect. We find here few or no traces of Buddhism in the B\u0101rata Yudda and Viv\u0101ha.\n\n3. Smara dahana, the burning of Smara (the god of love): a well-known Indian myth. The god \u015aiva is interrupted in his penance by Smara (or K\u0101ma), that is to say, he loses the fruits of his penance by falling in love. Enraged by this, he burns the\ngod of love in flames which issue from his body. The god of love is therefore also called Anangga (the bodiless), because his body was burnt by Siva. This work, too, is of the time of Ayer Langgia, Prince of Kediri. The author is called M'pu Darmaja, son of Raja Kusuma, the composer of the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a Kavi.\n\n4. Sum\u0101na Santaka comprises part of the Indian Raghuva\u1e47\u015ba. Raghu, the ancestor of R\u0101ma, begets the Adia; she is permitted to choose her consort after the Indian royal custom (Swayamvara, also so called on Bali). Her husband Devindu died, and she then gave birth to Dasarata, the father of R\u0101ma. This work also is composed in Kediri or Daha under Ayer Langgia; the writer is M'pu Monaguna (the name signifies \"whose prominent attribute is silence, mauna\"). The writers of the three latter works bear Sanskrit names, and belong to the \u015aivaitic sect; the names of the Buddhist writers are in the language of the country, and, in this circumstance, likewise, the characteristic of that religion is conspicuous, which made its way chiefly by yielding to and adopting the manners of the numerous and widely different countries into which it was propagated; whilst Brahmanism, rigidly adhering to the ancient traditions, and holding in contempt all that is foreign, is nowhere found beyond India except in Java and Bali, and perhaps in parts of Sumatra and Celebes.\n\nAll the three above-mentioned works are in a peculiarly good style, and highly esteemed, and this chiefly because they are of \u015aivaitic authorship.\n\n5. Bomakavya; the song of Boma (or Bh\u0101uma)*, \"the son of the earth;\" he is begotten by Vish\u1e47u from Pritivi (the earth), and has, as son of the earth, a demon form and disposition. He is a D\u0101nava (that is, like the Grecian Giants and Titans). He waged war against Indra, the god of (the lower) heaven, and triumphed over him. (Indra is also overcome by Ravana, the giant-king of Ceylon, and his power appears everywhere as secondary, against which the evil spirits are proof.) One of the higher gods (Vish\u1e47u or Siva) must subject his adversaries in order to restore peace and order on earth. Here it is sang K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the well-known (eighth) incarnation of Vish\u1e47u, who kills Boma, and delivers Indra from his distress. Boma is killed by being lifted up from the earth, which constantly re-invigorates him. The author is M'pu Bradah Boda, that is, \"a Bauddha, a Buddhist;\" he wrote in the time of Jayabaya of Kediri. Under that king Buddhism seems to have found its way for the first time into Kediri (the largest empire which existed in Java before Majapahit).\n\n6. Arjuna Vijaya (\"the triumph of Arjuna\") is formed after the Uttar\u0101k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da in like manner as the B\u0101rata Yuddha after the\n\n* Buma Kalantaka, by Raffles; the name Anraka Sura has not yet come to my knowledge in Bali. (Raffles, vol. i. p. 388).\nfour above-mentioned Parvas. It contains the combat of Arjuna with R\u0101vana and his victory. R\u0101vana is here bound, but not yet killed, because his time has not yet arrived. He is to be destroyed by R\u0101ma. Whether we are warranted in supposing, here, an expedition of the Brahman Hindus against the South of India and Ceylon, previous to that of R\u0101ma (who is considered to be a personification of the subjugation of those regions), further research must show. The composer is M'pu Tantular Boda, likewise a Buddhist in Kediri under Jayabaya.\n\n7. Suta Soma.\u2014The ratu Detia (Danawa, Demon). Purusada had made captive all the kings of Baratavarsa and conquered the ratu Darma. He is overcome by Suta Soma and his relative Prabu Maketu. It contains many episodes, and also the history of R\u0101ma. The subject is said to be taken from the Ketaka Parva (vide supra), although we should not have expected it from the nature of that work. The author is the same who composed the Arjuna-Vijaya\u2014viz., the Buddhist M'pu Tantular of Kediri.\n\nWe have thus compositions from older works in the epoch of Jayabaya, or at least of the successors of the King of Ayer Langgia; it appears that the older Kavi language then began to be difficult of comprehension, and that the favourite subjects of literature were, therefore, translated into a more comprehensible language. The influence of the Buddhists in this innovation is not to be mistaken.\n\n8. Harivangsa.\u2014This likewise is an Indian poem, commonly joined to the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata (the Indian one is translated by Langlois in Paris and obtainable in Calcutta); this piece, too, invites us to a comparison between India and Java, the Kavi and the Sanskrit. The contents, according to the priests, are: the conduct of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a towards Rukmini (his wife), and the war against the two princes Jarasanda, father-in-law of Kansa, ruler of Magada, and Chedi or Sisupala. This work was written in Majapahit,* and is thus of later origin than the preceding; the author is M'pu Penulu Boda, likewise a Buddhist. The King of Majapahit at this period was Brayang V'kasing Suka, father of Bra Vijaya (Brovijoyo), who, according to Javanese records, was the last (Hindu) prince of Majapahit.\n\nThese are the most important works of the Kavi literature, so far as I am yet acquainted with it. With these, however, we are far from having exhausted Balinese literature. We have besides\n\n* Majapahit is the literal translation of the Sanskrit Vilvalikta (corrupted, Vilatikta, Us. Java), the bitter vilva (aegle marmelos); this then at least is not a fictitious fruit, and the name of Majapahit not unmeaning, as it was formerly considered (vide Raffles).\n\n1 [See also R. van Eck in the Introduction (pp. vi.\u2013viii.) to his edition of Megantaka, in the Batavian \"Verhandelingen,\" vol. xxxviii.]\nthem, first, the law-books written in prose; further, the Tuturs, or \"instructive writings,\" of which nothing can as yet be ascertained, since they are for the most part secret writings. Further, the Babads, or historic-genealogical works, partly written in Kidung\u2014i.e. the newer (Javanese) measure, partly in prose. Moreover, we have pure Polynesian myths; above all, those of Panji, which are likewise written in Kidung. Then there also exist little essays on the transmigration of the soul, on erotic subjects, &c.; and finally there is the Balinese \"Kalendar,\" a work of the utmost importance.\n\nBabad, or Historical Essays.*\n\n1. Kenhangrok.\u2014He is a son of Brahma and progenitor of the rulers of Kediri, Majapahit and Bali. It has not as yet been ascertained in what epoch he must be sought for. His residence was in the Kampong M'dok, whose situation is not known in Bali, but is supposed to be in Baratavarsa. It is written in prose, and contains forty or more lontar-leaves. I am only in possession of the first part, which has no more than seventeen leaves. His mother is called Kenhendok. The god Brahma met her, much in the same way as the Greek Zeus knew how to win his numerous loves, whilst she, as a married woman, was amusing herself in the field.\n\n2. Rangga Lawe.\u2014\u015aiva Buddha (N. B.), ruler of Tumapel, is made captive for misgovernment by the King of Daha or Kediri, and his empire Tumapel is overthrown. The chief minister of Kediri is Rangga Lawe; he at a later time disagrees with his sovereign, and is finally vanquished and put to death. The work contains a minute description of the Court of Kediri and the position of the grandees of the empire, and may serve as a pattern of the constitution of the old empire in Java. It is, especially, maintained on Bali that the Court of Majapahit was altogether in the same style, and that all the rules of the Court of Kediri were carried to Majapahit. For this reason it would be desirable to have this work published (text and translation), accompanied by the necessary notes; this, however, can only be usefully done in Bali. The manuscript in my possession contains sixty-seven lontar-leaves, each of four lines front and back, and is written very neatly. It was written in Garogor (Glogor) in Badong, on the day of Saneschara Kaliwon Landep, in the month Kasa, the thirteenth day of the increasing moon, in rah 9, tengg\u00e8k 6, corresponding with the year of Christ 1847, Saturday, the 26th\n\n* The name Babad is also met with in Java (vide Raffles, \"Literature,\" vol. i. p. 393), and it also comprises, following him, all the historic works and new chronicles. Raffles spells it Babat. In Bali I find the word written Babad. [See also J. J. Meinsma, \"Babad Tanah Djawi,\" vol. ii. pp. 1-15.]\nof June. It commences with a metre of fifty-two syllables in each line, the stanza as usual of four lines.\n\n3. Usana Java.\u2014\"The ancient institutions of Java,\" a work containing the subjugation of Bali by the Javanese of Majapahit and the settling of the Deva Agung in Gelgel, with the distribution of the lands amongst the grandees of the Court. One manuscript of it had twenty-nine lontar-leaves, and was derived, as they told me, from Pasuruang; it, however, probably, came from Bali to this place, and seems to be little or not at all known in Java. It is written in prose. In that work a predilection for Arya Damar and his family is plainly manifested, whilst it passes over the Patih Gaja Madda, the founder of Mengwi and ancestor of the powerful family of Karang-Asem, almost in silence. For this we may find reason in the circumstance that it was originally composed by a follower of the dynasty of Arya Damar. According to the postscript it was written in Galogor by Pamchuttan (in Badong), on the day Rediti Pahing (Sunday), in the week Dungulan, in the month of Kanam (the 6th), on the thirteenth day of the dark half, in the year 1 (rah), of the tengg\u00e9k* 6. This would be the year 51; if we take the eighteenth century, we should have 1751 of Saka, corresponding to the year 1839 of the Christian era.\n\n4. Usana Bali.\u2014The contents of it are known from the \"Tijdschrift voor Nederlandsch Indie,\" 9th year, vol. iii. pp. 245-373. There I have said that it is a work exclusively intended for the people, and not esteemed by the priests. It is otherwise with the Usana Java, which is held in honour by all castes, at least in Badong.\n\n5. Pamendanga.\u2020\u2014A sort of chronicle of more recent times. It contains sundry confused histories of priests and kings, of the distribution of Bali amongst the original Pungavas of Gelgel, and genealogies of kings, of Karang-Asem, for instance. Respecting the division of the vice-regencies among the Pungavas, this work widely differs from the Usana Java, and its value and style are far inferior to those of the latter. It is also written in prose. Other Babads are found in the family of every prince; if it were possible to gather the greater part of them from the different States, they certainly would spread much light on the history of Bali, if carefully compared with each other.\n\nTuturs, or Doctrinal Writings.\n\nThese are divided into two classes: the secret writings of the priests, and such as are also current among the other castes, espe-\n\n* Tengg\u00e9k is a period of ten years. Rat, a single year of that time. Supposing the era to be known, we find from it the year of Saka.\n\n\u2020 From the Pamendanga a play is derived, performed by a single person in topengs (masks); it represents the more ancient history of Bali\u2014viz., of the Deva Agungs.\ncially the second and third. The former are extremely numerous, but since they are kept secret, we can only mention the names of a limited number of them. They seem to be written, like the Vedas, in \u015alokas. The names I obtained are the following:\n\n1. Buvana Sangk\u1e63epa (the shortening or contraction of the world or of men).\n2. Buvana Kosa (the treasure of the world).\n3. V\u1e5bhihaspati Tatva (the Tatva, truth, the essence of V\u1e5bhihaspati, the star Jupiter, teacher of the gods).\n4. Sarasa Muschaya (s\u0101rasa is explained by isi, the contents; it is, however, probably s\u0101r\u0101sa, the lotus; muschaya is not very clear, but is explained by kumpulan, \u201caccumulation,\u201d \u201cgathering\u201d; this is one of the works enumerated by Crawfurd.\u00b9\n5. Tatva Jn\u0101na (knowledge of substance, essentia).\n6. Kandampat.\n7. Sajotkranti.\n8. Tutur Kamoksa (vide infra). Under this denomination exist numerous works; it means, \u201cinstruction for blessedness, or for delivery from the transmigration of the soul.\u201d\n\nThe second class of the Tuturs, current, also, among the other castes besides the Brahmans, are, for instance:\n\n1. Rajan\u012bti (wisdom of kings); it contains rules for the policy and the government of kings, and it is in many respects analogous to Machiavelli\u2019s \u201cPrinceps.\u201d\n2. Nitipraya or Nitis\u0101stra (superabundance, or manual of wisdom): it is of a similar character with the former.\n3. Kamendaka Niti (rules of wisdom of the sage Kamendaka).\n4. Narana\u1e6dya (nara \u201cmen,\u201d natya \u201cthe mimic\u201d).\n5. Rangayajna (the sacrifice of the battle).\n6. Titi dasa gunita; this belongs properly to the first division, but has been made by Padanda Vahu Ravuh into Kavi under the name of Nitisara (compendium of wisdom).\n\nLaw-Books.\n\nThese are written in prose. They comprise most of the Balinese books which are mentioned by Crawfurd and Raffles. The accounts of them, however, differ from each other. Raja Kasiman names them:\n\n1. \u0100gama.\n2. Adigama.\n3. Dev\u0101gama (somewhat difficult to understand).\n4. S\u0101rasamuchchaya (the same we have just met with among the secret writings).\n5. Dustakalabaya (the fear of the malignant Kala), a law-book, in which in particular the faults committed by children are punished.\n\n\u00b9 [It should be s\u0101ra-samuchchaya, the aggregate of truth.]\n6. *Svara Jambu* (the voice of Jambu), that is, \u201cthe command, the law of India,\u201d *Jambu-Dvipa*.\n\n7. *Devadanda* (in very old language), it comes in use when *Vishnu* appears incarnated upon earth.\\(^1\\)\n\n8. *Yaj\u00f1asadma* (*yaj\u00f1a* \u201csacrifice\u201d\u2014*sadma*?)\n\nThe *Pandita* in *Taman Intaram* mentions only\n\n1. *\u0100gama.*\\(^*\\) 2. *Adigama*, the two law-books mentioned by Raffles as the basis of the law for the common people. Raffles calls the latter *Degama*.\n\n3. *P\u016brv\u0101digama* or *Sivas\u0101sana*, the above *Adigama*, or \u201cthe command of Siva,\u201d of value exclusively for the Brahmans.\n\n4. *Dev\u0101gama*, the *\u0101gama* of the *Devas*.\n\n5. *Svajambu\u2014Svarajambu*; the meaning is doubtful; perhaps *svara*, \u201cvoice,\u201d \u201ccommand,\u201d and *jambu*, in lieu of *Jambu Dvipa* (*India*), thus, \u201cthe voice of the law of India.\u201d\n\nThe principal law-book from India (ap. Raffles\u2019 *Menava Sastra*, Ind. *M\u0101nava-dharma-\u015b\u0101stra*) is wanting, according to all inquiries for it which I made among several priests and persons of rank. They, however, are aware that all their laws have been derived from *Prabu Manu* (the ruler of Manu), who, in different ages, under different names, holds the government of the world. I found it mentioned only in the *Siva\u015b\u0101sana*, the law-book of the Brahmans, under the name *Dharma-\u015b\u0101stra Ku\u1e6d\u0101ra-M\u0101nav\u0101di*; *\u0101di* has here, it would seem, the true Indian sense \u201cand so forth,\u201d so that the translation will be \u201cthe law-books, that of Ku\u1e6d\u0101ra M\u0101nava and the others.\u201d Ku\u1e6d\u0101ra\u2020 is also mentioned by Raffles as \u201ca law-book,\u201d and is not explained by Humboldt. Ku\u1e6d\u0101ra appears to me to be the same as *Uttama*\u2014viz., the name of the third in the line of *Manus*. The conversion of *Uttama* into Ku\u1e6d\u0101ra is quite possible, and supported by a passage of the *Brahm\u0101nda-pur\u0101\u1e47a*: *Ut\u0101ra Manu*, lont. 11. *Ut\u0101ra* is the comparative, \u201cthe higher,\u201d and *Uttama* the superlative, \u201cthe highest\u201d degree. The\n\n\\(^1\\) [A Dutch translation of this short code (35 sections) appeared in the Batavian \u201cTijdschrift,\u201d vol. xviii. pp. 295\u2013309.]\n\n\\(^*\\) *\u0100gama* is explained by Wilson, Sanskrit Dict., \u201ca \u015a\u0101stra or work on science and of divine origin.\u201d In the Malayan and common Balinese language signifies religion; in the names *\u0100gama*, *Adigama*, *Dev\u0101gama*, it has evidently more the old Indian meaning, and especially that of law-book. *Adigama* seems to have originated in *Adhi* and *\u0100gama*, with the omission of the first *\u0101* of *\u0100gama*, a carelessness which is frequently met with among the Sanskrit words in the Kavi\u2014e.g., *Svatamaparva* for *\u0100\u015bval\u0101th\u0101maparva*. The *a* in Polynesian words is a euphonic prefix, which was then omitted in the Sanskrit words likewise.\n\n\u2020 Ku\u1e6d\u0101ra is, following Wilson, \u201cthe post round which the string passes that works the churning-stick.\u201d This explanation is here in no way applicable. [The whole question as to the existence, on Bali, of a *M\u0101nava-\u015b\u0101stra* and a *Ku\u1e6d\u0101ra-\u015b\u0101stra* has been fully treated by Dr. J. C. G. Jonker in his work, \u201cEen Oud-Javaansch Wetboek\u201d (Leiden, 1885), pp. 11\u201320].\nbefore Utara I am inclined to regard as the Polynesian prefix, added through ignorance. Opposed to this conjecture, it is true, is the fact that the law of India must have been framed by the first Manu, Svayambhuva Manu; but we have various law-books, and these are even yet not all known. Possibly the original Balinese law-book has been derived from another Indian one, although the contents are upon the whole the same as in that of Svayambhuva.\n\nThis Dharma\u015b\u0101stra Ku\u1e6dara M\u0101nava is either now in Bali and kept secret, or it is one of the works which existed in Java, but were lost and were not brought to Bali. It is mentioned along with the S\u0101rasamuchchaya, which we learn to be one of the Tuturs; further, along with the Kamandaka, a Tutur for obtaining advantage or intrepidity. A learned Brahman is expected to be acquainted with all these works. It was not without the greatest difficulty that I got the \u015aivas\u0101sana into my hands; however, I may hope to obtain in the like way insight into the remaining law-books and the Tuturs. The \u015aivas\u0101sana was borrowed by me on the same condition as the Brahmandapura\u1e47a\u2014viz., not to show it to any one of the people. The manuscript of the \u015aivas\u0101sana in question was written on the day Mahulu Pahing Anggara (Tuesday), of the week Sungsang, in the year of Saka (Sakavarsa) 1682 (A.D. 1760), in the month Sravana, on the eighth day of the white half, in Vilatikta.* After this the writer makes his excuses in the customary manner for the bad and careless writing, and he has great need to do so, for the manuscript abounds in faults; he pleads his inexperience (muda) and inferiority (hina dina). He adds further that the work is a secret writing (rahasya), and concludes with the well-known invocation:\n\nSiddir astu, tat\u2019 astu astu  \nOng Saraswatie namah  \nOng g\u2019mung Ganapataye namah  \nOng sri Gurubyo namah  \nOng ong K\u0101madevaya namah\n\nRespecting these invocations, we refer to what is said under R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a and B\u0101rata Yuddha. Here only is added \u201cOng adoration to K\u0101madeva!\u201d He, the god of love, would thus appear to be peculiarly the favourite deity of the writer. The god of love is indeed highly honoured and praised in many of the newer poems, a circumstance the analogy of which we find\n\n* Where this Vilatikta is to be sought for in Bali remains uncertain; it is (Vilvatikta) the Sanskrit name for Majapahit. It is possible that the work was originally written in Majapahit, and that the copyists in succession retained the name of the city where it originally was composed, although they themselves were in Bali.\nagain in India. We give here the prologue, the text and the translation of the \u015aiva\u015b\u0101sana:\n\n\"This is the P\u016brv\u0101d\u012bgama\u2014\u015a\u0101sana-\u015b\u0101stra-s\u0101ro-dr\u0113tta,* first composed by the accomplished old teacher, the raja Purohita, who knows all qualities, who resembles the rays of the sun, who dwells in the hearts of all mankind; Mi\u015braharana, who, as the highest precious stone, outshines all the divine teachers of \u015aiva (of the \u015aivaite sect), the lowest, the middle, and the highest; further is he named the first Guru, the great saint. The same asked for ashes, after he had obtained permission to ask for ashes of the children and grandchildren of Sang Basmangkura(?); the same commanded him thereupon to compose the \u015a\u0101san\u0101d\u012bgama \u015a\u0101strasarodr\u0113ta for all priests, as many as hold the religion of \u015aiva; for the Panditas of \u015aiva as well as who live in the cities, the perfect ones, as also those who choose to dwell partly in cities, partly in the country, also for the host of the learned, who take care of processes, who settle disputes between all men, at the Court and in the country, this is their number. Assuredly the Adigama\u015b\u0101stra sarodr\u0113ta must contain the laws for the conduct of them all.\"\n\nThere further exists in Bali a law-book, called Svara, issuing from the Deva Agung, and in force for all princes and persons of rank. It cannot, as yet, be ascertained whether it is the same work as the Svarajambu (or Svajambu), but it seems to be a different one, since the addition of Jambu in the latter points to its Indian origin.\n\nTatwa or Tutur kamoksa (vide above) contains rules for a religious life, with special directions from the birth of a man up to his death. It frequently prescribes fasting (Ind. vrata, brata, votum). In accordance with those writings not only the Padandas regulate their lives, but also the princes and those of rank who aspire to the condition of holiness; they attain, thereby, the\n\n* This word must be divided, it would appear, into two parts; Purvadigama sasana, \"the command, law of the Purvadigama,\" and \u015a\u0101stra Saro dr\u0113ta, \"in which is contained the essence of holy works.\" The Saro is inserted instead of Sara, and we thus find the nominative case in place of the theme in a composition. This seems to be an error founded very likely in the want of acquaintance with the meaning of the Sanskrit terminations and inflexions, but offering at the same time another proof of the preservation of the inflexions in the memory of the Panditas. [S\u0101ro-dr\u0113ta = s\u0101rod\u0101hyita, \"gathered from the essence of the S.-f.\"]. The \u015aiva\u015b\u0101sana or P\u016brv\u0101d\u012bgama\u015b\u0101sana is the law-book for all the Brahmans, in the cities as well as in the country, and for those in whose hands the jurisdiction is deposited as well as for the rest. It is not, however, applicable in the decision of the lawsuits of persons belonging to one of the three lower castes.\n\n1 [The transliterated Kavi text, with Friederich's explanatory notes, is here, for obvious reasons, omitted.]\n\n2 [See P. L. van Bloemen Waanders in the Batavian \"Tijdschrift,\" vol. viii. (1859), pp. 201-27, and the Introduction to Jonker's work previously mentioned.]\ndignity of Resi (a saint, without sin), and the priests become Brahmarshi, the princes Rajarsi; the latter, of course, as it is natural, in consequence of their birth, rank below the former. Every prince must properly aim at this dignity, and the Abiseka, \"the anointing\" of the chief prince, is dependent upon it. By becoming Resi and by the Abiseka, not only the dignity of the prince is raised, but he is, thereby, as it were, received into the caste of the Brahmans\u2014the like rule is also observed in India. The predecessor of the last sovereign of Pam'chuttan was Resi, and had received the Abiseka; even as the former Deva Agungs. At present there is no prince of Bali who has received the Abiseka. The R\u00e2j\u00e2 Kassiman, however, aims at the dignity of Resi.\n\nMalat.\n\nThe Malat contains the history of the celebrated hero Panji, who had his adventures on Bali also. The work is as voluminous as the R\u00e2m\u00e2yana; it is, however, not written in the Kavi measure or language, but in Kidung, which means the newer Java-Balinese measure. The subjects contained in it are exhibited to the public in the Gambuh (dramatic performances by men, who speak themselves). The same is the case with the R\u00e2m\u00e2yana. The B\u00e2rata Yuddha and Viv\u00e2ha are represented in the Vayang Kulit in the same manner as on Java. Of the Indian drama nothing seems to have found its way into this island. The names of the most famous of the Indian dramas are unknown there. The tale of the Sakuntala is known from one of the Parvas, and the original narration we find also in India in the Mah\u00e2bh\u00e2rata. But the magnificent drama Sakuntal\u00e2 of K\u00e2lid\u00e2sa is not known. The reason of this is, probably, that most of the Indian dramas are of late times, and, perhaps, at the time the Brahmans came to Java, were exclusively found at the courts of the princes of Ujjayini, Kashmir, Ayodhy\u00e2, &c., so that the Brahmans could not be acquainted with them. Besides, the drama forms no part of the sacred literature, and the Brahmans might have neglected it for that reason.\n\nRELIGION.\n\nThe religion of Bali, as is well known, is the Hindu, and in fact the two great Indian creeds, the Brahmanical and the Buddhist, exist there. The adherents of the latter are few in number, and live in Karang-Asem in the dessa of Buddha Kling (Crawfurd) and in Gyanyar, in Batuan. These Buddhists, whom no European has ever visited, appear, however, to hold a modified form of religion. Crawfurd remarks that the people of Boleteng had\n\n1 [R. van Eck, in \"Bijdragen,\" III. vol. ii. pp. 3-5.]\nspoken rather contemptuously of the Buddhists, but I have not noticed this in the southern part of Bali. It is true they are said to be allowed to eat all kinds of animals, cows for example, which the worshippers of \u015aiva are forbidden to eat, and dogs and other unclean things, but they are not accused of actually eating them.\n\nAs for the relations between \u015aivaism and Buddhism, the Panditas state that Buddha is \u015aiva\u2019s youngest brother, and that the two sects exist peacefully side by side, although the Buddhists do not worship \u015aiva, and the \u015aivaites do not adore Buddha. In the form of worship, however, an intermixture of the two religions is apparent, for, on great feasts, e.g., the Panch\u0101valikrama, a priest of Buddha is invited to join the four Panditas of \u015aiva, and performs his devotions sitting towards the south, while the other four throughout the service sit towards the remaining cardinal points, and in the middle. At the cremation of princes, moreover, the holy water from a \u015aivaitic Pandita is mingled with that of a Pandita of Buddha, and is used in this form by the worshippers of \u015aiva. The intermixture of the two religions is also shown by the frequent mention of Buddha in the Kavi writings, and by the Buddhist composers of these writings, these works being also held in honour by the \u015aivaites. This, however, applies more to Java, whence all those writings came, but it is partly applicable to Bali also. So much is certain, that the Buddhists in Bali (and in earlier times in Java) were not fanatics, and that they left the Hindu Pantheon undisturbed, whilst they worshipped Buddha as the only true God.\n\n\u015aIVAITES.\n\nThe great majority of the Balinese hold the Brahmanical belief, and belong to the sect of \u015aiva. There is no trace of the other sects (Vishnuites) in Bali, and the worship of \u015aiva has absorbed, as it were, that of all other gods of the Hindu Pantheon. The religion may be divided into the private worship of the priests and the public worship of the people.\n\nTHE DOMESTIC WORSHIP OF THE PRIESTS.\n\nThe domestic rites of the Panditas remind us of the ancient Veda-worship of the Indian Brahmans, and in fact owes its origin to it. In old times the Brahmans in India did not worship the gods of the people; Brahma, Vishnu or \u015aiva, and all the rest of the gods connected with them, had no existence for those men\u2014they adored the celestial bodies, especially the sun, and fire (Agni) and various stars. The domestic worship of the Brahmans in Bali has also the sun for its object, and is called suryasevana (worship of the sun); it is performed without temples or idols and with but few offerings. Upon asking what the sun meant, I was told that it was \u015aiva, and therefore we may presume that the Brahmans no\nlonger hold the ancient faith, and have adopted the ordinary service of \u015aiva. \u015aiva, however, has become so idealized, at any rate by the Brahmans, that he may very well be identified with the supreme (solar) deity, and in the popular creed of India \u015aiva is also the representative of fire, and bears the sun as the third eye in his forehead. We, therefore, adhere to the hypothesis, that the Brahmans in Bali have preserved the ancient worship of the Indian Brahmans, which is based on the Vedas alone, and takes but little or no notice of the gods of the people, and that, although they conduct and regulate the worship of the popular gods, they do not themselves take part therein.\n\nI have been permitted to see the domestic devotions of a Padanda. They are performed between nine and eleven o'clock in the morning, on a fasting stomach, and are obligatory at least at full and new moons, in addition to which most Panditas perform them on every fifth day (Kalivon, according to the Polynesian week of five days). Especially holy priests, and those of high rank, such as the Padanda Made Aleng Kach\u00e9ng in Taman Intaran, observe them daily. On ordinary days, however, the service is not so long as on Kalivon, and on this day again it is shorter than at full and new moons. On the latter occasions, too, the priest is arrayed in his full vestments. The place of worship is a Bale, in one of the priest's inner courts. The portion of the Bale* where the ceremony takes place is surrounded on three sides with a lattice-work of bamboo: that of my Padanda was only open to the west. The Padanda is clothed in white, with the upper part of the body naked, after the Balinese-Indian manner. He sits with his face to the east, and has before him a board upon which stand several small vessels containing water and flowers, some grains of rice, a pan with fire, and a bell. He then mumbles, almost inaudibly, some words or prayers from the Vedas, dipping the flowers into the water and waving them and a few grains of rice before him (towards the east) with the forefinger and thumb of his right hand, whilst at the same time he holds up the pan containing fire. After having proceeded with his prayers for some time, during which he makes all kinds of motions with his fingers and turns his rosary, he appears to be inspired by the deity; \u015aiva has, as it were, entered into him; this manifests itself in convulsions of the body, which grow more and more severe, and then gradually cease. The deity having thus entered into him, he no longer sprinkles the water and flowers towards the east alone, but also towards his own body, in order to pay homage to the deity which has passed into it. The bells are not used in the ordinary daily worship, but only at the full and new moons and cremations.\n\n* The names of the Bale are: Yasa, Mahant\u00e9n, Mahari, Boat; the holy water is called Sevamba, i.e., \u015biva and ambhas, \"water of \u015aiva.\"\nBy this ceremony the Padanda is completely purified; all his actions, even the partaking of earthly food, are holy. He then eats (but only once in the day); while he is doing so no one but his children, who wait upon him, may approach, and they keep silence. The remains of his food are like Amrita (Ambrosia), and are eagerly solicited and consumed by those present\u2014including the princes, if they have a Pandita in their house, or happen to be in his house. The water which the Pandita has used during his devotions is looked upon, in accordance with the Vedas, as holy; it is called toya tirta (water of a holy place), and is bought by the people for their purifications, for sprinkling corpses and for offerings. This is one of the sources of income to the Panditas. In addition to his domestic worship, he performs the public religious ceremonies (see below), and conducts the cremations and the offerings for the departed. In his own house, moreover, he occupies himself with the Vedas, with the sacred and the common Kavi literature; he teaches his children and those (chiefly princes and men of rank) who come to him as pupils. He is also the people's astronomer and astrologer, and alone knows how to regulate the calculation of time according to the different divisions of the year (see the Balinese Calendar). Finally, he consecrates the weapons. Every new weapon to be wrought is brought to him before the operation: he places some mysterious signs upon it, especially the word Ong (om), and until this has been done, the weapon is of no value or power. When the weapon is quite finished, the owner makes offerings and the Pandita reads the Vedas over it to insure its effectiveness.\n\nReligion of the People.\u2014Places of Worship.\n\nThe chief places of worship are the saq-kahyangan (the six temples)\u2014so-called kar' \u1f10\u03be\u03bf\u03c7\u03af\u03bd. They are all dedicated, under various names, to Siva. The principal and oldest temple, the founding of which is narrated in the Usana Bali, is (1) in Basuki, at the foot of the Gunung-Agung, the holy mountain in Karang-Assem; the name of the deity is sang Purnajaya, and his weapon tuak (a sword-like creese).\n\n(2). Vatu Kahu, in Tabanan, at the foot of the peak of Tabanan, called Barattan or Vatu Kahu; the name of the deity is sang Jayaningrat, the weapon panah (bow).\n\n(3). Uluvatiu, on the point of the table-land (bukit) in Badong, picturesquely situated above the sea, over which the rock on which the temple stands projects. This temple is the prahu of Devi Danu. The deity worshipped here is sang Manik Kumavang (the brilliant precious-stone); his weapon is tumbak (lance). The access is difficult, through rocks and wild places. The temple can only be approached with the Sovereign.\n(4). Yeh Jeruk (Jeruk-water), in Gyanyar, in the interior, in the Kampong of Narangkana; the deity is sang Putra Jaya (the prince of victory); the weapon pedang (sword).\n\n(5). Giralava, in Klongkong, on the coast; the deity is Sanging Jaya (the triumphant one); the weapon is sambuk (whip).\n\n(6). Pakendungan, in Tabanan, on the coast. The name is sang Manik Kaleba (kaleba = dumilah, brilliant); the weapon duung (sword-like creese).\n\nThese are the principal temples, in which the rulers make offerings for the whole people. In Uluvatu, the feast-day is the twenty-first of the Balinese year; in Basuki, on the full moon of the month Kapat or Karttika (in September or October). A few other places, although of less consequence than those already mentioned, are of special importance.\n\n(1). Sakennan, on the island Serangan, belonging to Badong. The deity worshipped is sang hyang Indra; his weapon is the bajra (Sanskrit vajra), which really means lightning, but according to the drawing corresponds to the so-called thunderbolt. His feast is on the eleventh day after the Balinese new year.\n\n(2). Jempul, in Bangli, also with Indra as its deity.\n\n(3). Rambot Savi, in Jembrana, near the frontier of Tabanan.\n\n(4). Samantiga; and (5). K\u00ebnt\u00e9l Gunii, both in Gyanyar. It is not known what deities are worshipped in the last three. These places are sacred through the supernatural power which issues from the gods adored there.\n\nWe have besides in each dessa one or more Panatarans (natar, a court; the offerings to Durg\u00e1, K\u00e0la and the Bh\u00fatas, are placed upon the ground, in the court). In these Durg\u00e1, the wife of the malignant K\u00e0la, and the chief of the Bh\u00fatas or R\u00e1kshasas (evil spirits), is worshipped. The worship of these latter occupies the people almost more than that of the beneficent gods, for the pernicious influence of these beings must be guarded against in all sorts of ways, whereas the beneficent gods are more easily propitiated. Other temples are called Puri and Pangastanan; the former are, principally, for persons of the highest rank, and the latter for the people; here Siva is worshipped with his family. Another name is Par\u00e1ryangan, an assemblage of temples for all the gods and Pitara (the shades of the dead). The small temple-houses are called Kahyangan, place for a deity (Hyang). To these belong also the Sadkahyangan. Finally, there is in every house a number of small temples, called Sanggar (in Crawfurd, Sangga). Among these there is Meru, a temple with several roofs one above the other, rising up in the form of a pyramid, dedicated to Siva. The rest of the small temples are mostly devoted to the service of the Pitara. The house-temples of the princes are of some importance and costliness, but they are not built in the best taste. Among these, besides the Merus, which are of wood, we find also\nthe pyramidal erections of stone. *Padm\u00e1sana* (the *Padm\u00e1sana* must be dedicated to the sun; Siva is the sun), the apex of which is truncated and provided with a sort of stool, upon which incense is burnt to Siva, in his three forms\u2014viz., *Sad\u0101-Siva*, *Parama-Siva* and *Mah\u00e1-Siva* (the incense being of three sorts: *M'nyan*, *Madya-gawu* and *Chandana*); and *Chandi*, a complete pyramid, not truncated. Besides these buildings, one finds several *Bales*, partly of masonry (*G'dong Chant\u00e8l*) inlaid with Chinese porcelain and glass-work and ornamented at the back with pictures, and partly of wood (*G'dong Tarik*), upon which the offerings are placed. The *Meru* and *Padm\u00e1sana* are chiefly regarded as the seats of the supreme deity; the *Merus* are also provided with *lingas*, which however are, usually, merely of pointed wood and are fixed in great numbers in the roofs. The extremity of the *Merus* and also of the other small temple-houses is generally covered with an inverted pot or sometimes a glass, a circumstance that reminded me at once of Buddhism, since this seems to represent the dome (or *bubble*) which is the distinguishing feature of all Buddhist temples. The Sivaites, however, will not admit this, but they give no explanation of this ornament. The *linga* is also found in great numbers on the walls surrounding the temples, and here is of stone, shaped like the specimen which I have sent from *Boleleng* to the Batavian Genootschap. The original signification of the *linga* is almost lost; the word now means simply \"the most excellent one.\" In addition to the above, we have temples on the sea-coast, dedicated to the god of the sea, *Baruna*; and further, small houses in the *sawahs* and on the roads, dedicated to *\u015ar\u012b*, the consort of *Siva*; in the latter the passers-by strew a few grains of rice, if they have any with them.\n\n**The Gods Worshipped.**\n\nIn India, according to the popular belief, Brahm\u00e2, Vish\u1e47u and \u015aiva, or the *Trim\u016brti* (Trinity), are the supreme gods. It is well known that the Brahmins, originally the first caste, pay but little honour to these gods, and that the *Vedas* place other deities above them\u2014Vish\u1e47u and \u015aiva, indeed, playing a very subordinate part therein. The popular creed is further subdivided into two great sects, the one worshipping Vish\u1e47u, and the other \u015aiva, as its principal deity. In India, also, Brahm\u00e2 is not made the object of any special worship; as creator he is neutralized, as it were, for his work of creation is accomplished, while the attention of mortals is absorbed by Vish\u1e47u, the *preserver*, and the dreaded \u015aiva, the *destroyer*. It is certain that no Vish\u1e47uites ever came to Bali, nor probably to ancient Java. The only idols in Java which undoubtedly represent Vish\u1e47u are mostly found in conjunction with \u015aiva, and, it would appear, are merely added to make the retinue\nof the latter god larger and more splendid. It may be safely asserted that Vishnu has nowhere been the chief object of worship.\n\nIn Bali all the characteristics, names and attributes of Vishnu are given to \u015aiva; he combines in himself the power of all gods, all others being as it were but other forms of himself. \u015aiva is the highest invisible firmament (\u0101k\u0101\u015ba), or dwells alone in the heart; Brahm\u0101, fire, which through smoke becomes water, or Vishnu. Hence it is also that a Pa\u1e0danda is called \u015aiva; if \u015aiva were not the all-comprising deity, completely idealized, that designation would not be applicable to these holy men, whose power, through the study of the Vedas, is greater than that of the common gods. \u015aiva's heavens are, the Meru, Kail\u0101sa, Gunung Agung (Svarga or Indraloka; Vish\u1e47uloka or Brahmaloka, and Sivaloka are the three heavens rising one above the other).\n\nIn the Indian mythology we find several gods (Vishnu, Durg\u0101, Gaya\u015ba, Skanda, &c.) provided with many arms, to indicate their power. In Bali, four arms are given to \u015aiva alone, while all the other gods, unless they assume a demoniacal (R\u0101k\u1e63asa) shape, have but two arms. \u015aiva also has a third eye in his forehead (signifying in India the sun, but not recognized as doing so here) (mata trinatra) His names are: Paramesvara (the supreme lord); Mah\u0101\u015bvara (the great lord); Mah\u0101deva (the great god); \u015arikanda (the throat of eloquence?); Sudasina (with pure throne); Givaka (meaning uncertain); Sangkara, Garba (the fetus); Soma (the moon); Vrekanda (p); Kritiv\u0101sas (clothed in a tiger-skin); Garbad\u016bta (garbha, fetus, and d\u016bta, messenger); Gangg\u0101dara (he who carries the river Gangg\u0101 in his hair); Hara (he who grasps); K\u0101m\u0101ri (the enemy of K\u0101ma, the god of love); Vrishaketana (he who has the bull in his standard); Durjati, probably more correctly Durjati; Triambaka (he who speaks the three Vedas); Kawandi, Sarvaj\u00f1a (the omniscient); Viskandi, Pisnaki; B\u0101ma (V\u0101ma, the left-handed); Mr\u0113dd\u0101, Ugra (cruel); \u015a\u0101li (he who bears the trident); Ganasara, Gan\u0101d\u012bpa (the lord of hosts); \u012a\u015ba (the lord); \u012a\u015b\u0101na (ditto); Kandali, Matsyadurita (matsya, fish, and durita, sin); Pa\u015bupati (the lord of creatures); Tripur\u0101ri or Tripur\u0101ntaka (the enemy and destroyer of the demon Tripura; also Vishnu's name). Vrikshaketu (he who has a tree in his standard); Sambu, \u015a\u012brava, ear, and Bava, nature; Dara (the holding one); Krisnarsa, Kus\u0101di (he who has the Kusagrass as his first attribute); Saddakari\u1e47u (the enemy of the Saddaka); \u015a\u012bma (\u015b\u012bma, whole, or \u015b\u012bma, boundary); Prame\u1e63\u1e6di or Parame\u1e63\u1e6di (the highest); Nandakavahana (he who rides on the Nandi); K\u0101madahana (he who has burnt the K\u0101ma); Gir\u012b\u015ba (the lord of speech); Pravesada, S\u0101li (domestic?); Jiv\u0101tma (the soul of life); I\u015bv\u0101nukara, Pitambara (covered with a yellow garment); Berava (Bhairava, the terrible one, also a\nsubordinate deity in the demon-shape). *Nilakanta*, and *Nila-lohita* (with a dark blue throat, from drinking the poison that comes forth from the troubled sea); *\u015aani* (*\u015bani*, the name of the planet Saturn, and *sani*, worship); *\u012a\u015bvara* (the lord); *Dri\u1e63\u1e6daketu* (with plainly-visible standard); *Um\u0101pati* (consort of the *Um\u0101*); *Chaturbujja* (with four arms).\n\nPart of the manuscript of the *Chantaka-Parva* was wanting here, but many more names were mentioned to me from memory. \u015aiva appears to have in all not less than a thousand names in Bali, as in India. The following are further names: *B\u012bma* (he who is to be feared); *Rudra* (also a special class of eleven gods of this name); *Bava* (nature); *Kap\u0101labr\u012bt* (he who wears a skull-chain); and finally *Jagann\u0101\u1e6da* (the lord of the world). This last name always means Vish\u1e47u in India, but, in Bali, \u015aiva is the supreme and almost the only god, and thus Vish\u1e47u's principal name is given here to \u015aiva.\n\n\u015aiva's Attributes.*\n\nThese are different in his various forms and temples. He has the rosary (*guduha genitri*, Sansk. *aksham\u0101l\u0101*); the *fan* (*ubas-ubas*, Sansk. *ch\u0101mara*). These two symbols represent him as a penitent. He has further the *tri\u015b\u016bla* (the pointed trident, to be distinguished from the trident without points, which, e.g., the *Ba\u015bav\u0101n Trinavindu* in the Batavian Society's Collection carries, and which the Balinese call *Tekan*. Both tridents stand with their points upwards; the inverted trident (of Vish\u1e47u) I have not yet met with. \u015aiva also has in Bali, as in Java, the *Padma* (the lotus), which in India belongs to Vish\u1e47u; this, however, is not regarded as the lotus-flower, but as a weapon. We have already mentioned other symbols of \u015aiva in the *Sadkalhyangan*, namely, *Tuak*, a sword-like creese; *panah*, the bow; *tumbak*, the lance; *p'dang*, a sword; *sambuk*, a whip; and *duung*, a sort of creese. With the exception of the creeses, all these symbols are also Indian, and belong to \u015aiva in India; the creese, however, is purely Polynesian. The bow and the sword proper are not used in Bali, and which are only known there from the religion and the writings.\n\nFrom \u015aiva is to be distinguished *K\u0101la*; originally they were one and the same, but \u015aiva is the bright (white) god of light, while K\u0101la is the dark (black), terrible and destroying one. K\u0101la is worshipped, with Durg\u0101 and the *Bh\u016btas*, in the *Pantaran* and in the houses. The feast of *Bayak\u0101la*, the day before\n\n* \u015aiva became incarnate as *Arjuna Vijaya*. His wife, *Dev\u012b Yajnavat\u012b*, commits suicide upon hearing a false report of the death of her husband, and at the prayer of the holy *Pulastya* is called to life by *sang hyang Sagara* (the ocean) by means of *M\u1e5bitasanjivana* (life-giving Ambrosia).\nthe Balinese new-year, is dedicated to him, and he must be propitiated by bloody offerings. The offerings placed daily before the houses and in the niches of small pillars, or in the walls, are also intended for him and the Bh\u016btas.\n\n\u015aiva's consort is Umi. This is one of the many names of this deity, but not the principal one in India. In Bali it is used more commonly than P\u0101rvat\u012b; she is also called Giriputri (daughter of the mountain; P\u0101rvat\u012b has the same meaning). Durg\u0101 is distinct from her, as K\u0101la is from \u015aiva. (Durg\u0101 in conflict with Mahish\u0101sura does not appear in Bali.) She is also called Dev\u012b Gangg\u0101 and Dev\u012b Danu (the goddess of the mountain lake; this great mountain lake lies in the midst of the great Balinese range of mountains) [Us. Bali, p. 274]; in this character she is worshipped on the Gunung Batur, which rises from the middle of a mountain lake (Danu, Jav. ranu), and she is regarded as the cause of eruptions and of the overflowing of the waters which is indispensable for the cultivation of rice. As goddess of the rice-fields she is called Sri (in India Vish\u1e47u's wife is called Lak\u1e63hm\u012b, who here is also \u015aiva's wife) and has her temples on the sawahs and on the roads between them. She is also worshipped along with \u015aiva. The same applies to Ga\u1e47e\u015ba, who possesses no temples and but few images in Bali. On account of his misshapen form, he is not beloved.\n\nBrahm\u0101, like Vish\u1e47u, has no special temples; on great festivals, small-temple houses are erected for both deities, when offerings are made to all the gods, but after the festival these are taken down again. The following are other names for Brahm\u0101: Chaturmukha (provided with four faces); Praj\u0101pati (the lord of created beings, the creator); Padmayoni (born out of a lotus; he is supposed in the Indian Mythology to have come forth out of a lotus which rises to the surface of the sea out of the navel of Vish\u1e47u as N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, resting upon the bottom of the sea). According to the Balinese conceptions, he has only one head; if he is represented with more than one head, with four arms and other extraordinary limbs, he is to be regarded as Brahmam\u0101rti, or as a R\u0101kshasa (m\u0101rti, the body, form, figure, does not precisely express this idea). The same is true of Vish\u1e47u and other gods. Brahm\u0101, the creator, has been deprived of all his distinguishing features; he has no temples either in India or in Bali, and he is entirely subordinated to \u015aiva, the supreme deity, and although he appears in the Brahm\u0101ndapur\u0101\u1e47a as the creator of the latter, \u015aiva, when once created, possesses far greater power than Brahm\u0101 the creator. Brahm\u0101 and Vish\u1e47u are looked on in Bali as emanations or forces of \u015aiva, and as related to each other; Brahm\u0101 represents fire, Vish\u1e47u water; the fire through smoke is changed into water, and so Brahm\u0101's force passes into that of Vish\u1e47u. \u015aiva himself has the \u0101k\u0101\u015ba, the highest firmament, as\nhis element, and he dwells in the hearts of the purified.* (See as to Sad\u0101, Parama, Mah\u0101, \u015aiva, Us. Bali, p. 307.) Brahman's symbol is the danda (staff); a staff is carried by the Brahmins, if they become Panditas and hence it is that they are called Padandas \"provided with a staff.\" The danda, however, is also regarded as a weapon, and includes the idea of punitive justice.\n\nBrahm\u0101's wife is Sarasvat\u012b, the goddess of eloquence; she, too, has no special temples, but she has a feast-day in each Balinese year, in the week of Vatu Gunong, on the day of Saneschara Manis (Saturday). On this day all the manuscripts are brought into the house-temples and consecrated; the old prince Kassiman brings his in procession to Gunong rata (his country residence); a Pandita is called upon, and reads the Vedas over the manuscripts, whereby their holiness is renewed. At the same time offerings of rice, kwe-kwe, sirih, &c., are made to the goddess, and the floor of the temple is sprinkled with holy water. Sarasvat\u012b's names, according to the Chantaka-Parva, are: Ba\u015bi (bhaga, knowledge); B\u0101sa (language); Giva, Givasa, Veda (Science); Vidy\u0101yana (vidy\u0101, knowledge, ayana, road); Baradi, Yani, \u015aa\u015bravida (the learned in writings); Sudervi (the good goddess); D\u0101ri (the holder); Sumari, Ganggadari (she who holds the gangga); Praj\u00f1adari (she who holds learning); Kastavit, Darjimandari, Nilasiki, Satradana.\n\nVish\u1e47u is scarcely worshipped at all in Bali; as god of water less honour is paid to him than to Baruna, although the latter is a sea-god of inferior rank. The principal temples on the sea-coast are dedicated to \u015aiva; we have already spoken of the erection of a temple for Vish\u1e47u on festivals. Vish\u1e47u is nevertheless an important personage to the Balinese; in his various incarnations he is the hero of most of the Kavi works; it might be said that \u015aiva is the high and invisible, Vish\u1e47u the incarnate god, who has acquired infinite fame by his deeds on earth, and whose conduct serves as an example for all the actions of princes and people. His names, although better known from the Kavi writings than from religious worship, are as follow: N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a (he who floats upon or in the waters); Sori (Sauri, also a name for the planet Saturn); Chakrap\u0101ni (he whose hand is armed with the Chakra); Jan\u0101rdana (he who is plagued by men with prayers); Padman\u0101bha (he who has a lotus-navel; see Brahman Padmayoni); (the holy) K\u0113\u015bi; Kesa (the fine-haired); Vekunta (Vaikuntha, the careless one); Vistara (collection?); Srava (srava, the ear?). Indravaraja (the younger brother of Indra); Govinda (a name for Kris\u1e47a as a cowherd); Garu\u1e0da-dhvaja (he who has the Garu\u1e0da in his standard); Kesava (Kesa); Pundarik\u0101ksha (the lotus-eyed); Kris\u1e47a, Pit\u0101mbara (with a yellow garment); \u015aiva also is so named above); Vi\u1e63vak\u1e63ena (visvak, everywhere, s\u0113n\u0101, an army; whose army reaches\n\n* Sad\u0101-\u015aiva (the eternal \u015aiva) is a well-known name for \u015aiva in India, not for Brahman.\neverywhere). Svab\u00fb (self-born); \u0160angkhi (he who has the \u0160angkha, shell-trumpet); Danavara (perhaps Danav\u00e2ri, the enemy of the Danavas, the demons); Hanoksaja (?), Vriksha (this must be vrisha, the bull, also a name for Vishnu); Kapi (the ape); Basudeva (Vasudeva, the father of Krisna, literally \u201cthe god of riches,\u201d or V\u00e1sudeva, Krisna); M\u00e2dava and Madus\u00fbdana (the conqueror of the demon Madi). These names are given in the Chantakaparva in \u015blokas; with a few slight alterations we obtain pure inflected Sanskrit:\n\nVisnu N\u00e2r\u00e2yana Sori, Chakrap\u00e2ni Jan\u00e2rdanah\nPadman\u00e2ba Resi Kesah, Vekunta Vistara Srawa\nIndr\u00e2varaja Hupendrah, Gohvinda Garudadvaja\nKesavah Pundarik\u00e2sah, Krisnah Pit\u00e2mbarochatah\nVisvaksenah Svab\u00fb \u0160angkhi, Danavara Hanoksajah\nVresah Kapi Basudevah, M\u00e2dava Madus\u00fbdana.\n\nBesides these, his avatars are well known\u2014viz., Matsya, fish; Var\u00e2ha, wild pig; K\u00fbrma, tortoise. To these must be added two local ones, not known in India\u2014viz., Pati Gaja Madda, founder of the Karang-Asem family, and the cock Silingsing, the apotheosis of cock-fighting. Parta and Maruta also are incarnations of Vishnu, slain by R\u00e2vana. The following are yet other names for Vishnu: and V\u00e2mana and Tripur\u00e2ntaka (the dwarf and the conqueror of the demon Tripura; the latter name we have also found to belong to \u015aiva, and it has reference to the fifth Avat\u00e2ra); Narasingha, man-lion (in the fourth Avat\u00e2ra); R\u00e2ma (in the seventh Avat\u00e2ra); Purusottama (the most excellent of men, with reference to his numerous incarnations). His symbols are, in the first place, the chakra sudarsana (the disc, which, being well slung by him, penetrates everything, and returns to him); and then the \u0160angkha (the shell-trumpet), the gad\u00e2 (club), danda (the staff, also belonging to \u015aiva and Brahm\u00e2); the same applies to the tuak (a sword-like creese, which in one of the sadkahyangans belongs to \u015aiva as a distinguishing symbol). In images of Vishnu and Brahm\u00e2 we also find a circular mark on the forehead; this is a third eye, but appears to point to the Indian tilaka, the mark of the sect. No other remembrance, however, of this tilaka (which name is unknown here) has been preserved, and the Balinese seem to draw the mark on the foreheads of the gods in accordance with a tradition which is no longer understood, or endeavour to keep secret the origin of this sect-mark, in order that the form of religion, at present existing, may be regarded by every one as the only and true form. According to the statements of the\n\n1 [I.e., the six heavens. Sanskrit linguals are often represented by the corresponding (unaspirated) dentals in Kavi and Balinese; while, on the other hand, Sanskrit dentals frequently pass into linguals in those languages. Thus, sad = Sanskrit sha\u1e0d; but danda, from which paganda, = Sanskrit danda.]\npriests, Vishnu and Brahm\u0101 are invoked in the Vedas, and do indeed appear in the Indian Vedas, although as gods of a very inferior rank; if they play a higher part in the Vedas of Bali, we should again be compelled to entertain some doubts as to the authenticity and originality of these Vedas.\n\nVishnu's wife is \u015ar\u012b. We have already met with \u015aiva's consort under the name \u015ar\u012b, as protector of the rice-fields and goddess of fertility. According to Indian ideas, this is always Vishnu's wife; but just as many of the names and attributes of Vishnu are in Bali given also to \u015aiva, so \u015ar\u012b, originally the consort of Vishnu, appears in Bali as one of the names of \u015aiva's wife. We have already said that Vishnu and Brahm\u0101 are but other forms of \u015aiva; and so also their wives belong, as special forces (\u015ar\u012b, goddess of fertility, of abundance; Sarasvati, goddess of eloquence and learning), to \u015aiva, the supreme deity. Lak\u1e63mi is unknown as a name for Vishnu's wife. As Vishnu's consort, she has no special temples. The mark on her forehead, and on that of Sarasvati, is called peryasan, derived probably from yasa, Jav. yasa, fame, and in that case meaning excellence. The signification of this word, however, is not clear; and upon asking whether this were the sectarial mark (Tilaka), I was answered in the negative.\n\nWe have thus found that the three supreme gods of the popular creed of the Hindus are looked upon as expressions of one and the same force, are worshipped together, and regarded, as it were, as one being. \u015aiva in the popular belief also is almost the sole god; the inferior gods, with Indra at their head, are his lesser forces. The different names of the gods mean for the ignorant people, it is true, as many different gods, but the priests hold other views.\n\nWe will here say a few words respecting Indra and the inferior gods, and will then give an enumeration of the gods, as, according to the Brahmanda pur\u0101\u1e47a, they were created.\n\nIndra.\u2014This deity, the prince of the Devas, that is, of the subordinate gods, who require the Am\u1e5bita to keep them alive, and who are often brought into danger and vanquished by doers of penance and giants, has, singularly enough, special temples in Bali. Sakennan, in the island of Serangan in Badong, and Jempul in Bangli, we have already become acquainted with as such. The explanation of this we think is, that our \u015aivaitic sect has succeeded in making Vishnu (and Brahm\u0101) of little importance, and in causing him to be regarded as a part, an emanation or force of \u015aiva, but did not find it necessary to deprive of his worship the popular Indra, the example of princes, who is glorified in so many poems. Indra could never be inimical to the consequence of \u015aiva, and was therefore harmless to the imported \u015aivaism, and, by allowing him temples, the prejudices of his devotees were perhaps spared from a blow. His temples and attributes are even of\nconsiderable importance. He has also the third eye. The following are among his names: \u015aatakratu (worshipped with 100 offerings); Trinetra (provided with three eyes, like \u015aiva); Sahasranetra (provided with a thousand eyes; these are the stars, Indra himself the visible heavens, while the higher, invisible firmament, \u0101k\u0101\u015ba, represents \u015aiva;) Devar\u0101ja (the king of the Devas or subordinate gods); \u015aachipati, the husband of \u015aachi.\n\nHis weapon is the bajra (vajra, lightning; here, however, represented as a kind of weapon in the form of a thunderbolt).\n\nIndra\u2019s wife is \u015aachi, only remarkable on Indra\u2019s account.\n\nThe eight gods of the cardinal points (Lokap\u0101la) are named very frequently in the writings; in the religious worship they are less prominent. In the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a, lont, 181, these eight gods are enumerated as follows: Indra, Yama, S\u016brya, Chandra, Anila, Kuvera, Baru\u1e47a, Agni. We meet with the same names again in India, only Nir\u1e5biti appears there instead of S\u016brya, and \u012a\u015b\u0101n\u012b instead of Chandra. The order in which they stand, beginning with the east and going round by the south, is however different, and in India is tolerably fixed: Indra, in the East; Agni, N.E.; Yama, S.; S\u016brya (or Nir\u1e5biti), S.W.; Varu\u1e47a, W.; V\u0101yu (or Marut, Pavana, and in Bali Anila, all meaning wind), N.W.; Kuvera, N.; Chandra (or \u012a\u015b\u0101n\u012b), N.E. \u201cUsana Bali,\u201d p. 261, gives the eight cardinal points thus: (1) P\u016brva, East; (2) Gueha, S.E.; this is \u0100gneya (\u201cWilson,\u201d \u201cthe South-East quarter\u201d), to be derived from Agni; fire and the god of fire, whose throne is in the southeast; (3) Daksina, south; (4) Nir\u1e5biti (Sansk. Nair\u1e5biti, belonging to the south-west quarter, to Nir\u1e5biti; Nir\u1e5biti, according to some, S\u016brya, according to others, presides over that point of the compass), S.W.; (5) Pa\u015bchima, behind or west; (6) Vayavya (Sansk. V\u0101yavya, belonging to V\u0101yu, the wind, compare Anila, Pavana), N.W.; (7) Uttara, north; (8) Esania (not Resania), answering to the Sansk. \u0101\u015b\u0101nya or \u0101\u015b\u0101n\u012b, \u201cbelonging to \u012a\u015b\u0101n\u012b,\u201d N.E. Here, therefore, we have the names of the cardinal points accurately preserved by adjectives derived from the names of the guardian deities; even the less-known Nir\u1e5biti and \u012a\u015b\u0101n\u012b are not forgotten. It cannot surprise us, however, that in Bali all the cardinal points are attributed to various forms of \u015aiva, although this alteration seems to be of later date.\n\nYama and Baru\u1e47a are the only gods besides Indra of any note in the religious worship; they also are, to some extent, identical with \u015aiva. With Indra in his heaven we find the Var\u012bpsaras (the most excellent Apsaras), and the Vidy\u0101daras and Vidy\u0101daris (male and female spirits), as well as the Resis; the last are the human beings who have become gods, after having attained, through a holy life, to Indra\u2019s heaven; his heaven is called Svarga, or Indraloka, and is the ideal of a royal dwelling; the descriptions of it agree with the Indian accounts. Even this heaven and its\ninhabitants are not safe from the attacks of foes (see the Viv\u00e1ha, the combat between Indra and R\u00e1vana [the latter is called Indrajit, the vanquisher of Indra]; and other myths); its inhabitants are also liable to become human again, at least they require the Amrita in order to preserve their divine power. Indra's heaven lies beneath that of Vish\u1e47u (and Brahm\u0101), and the latter beneath that of \u015aiva. It is not until it reaches \u015aiva's heaven that the soul attains the repose and release of transmigration (Moksa). But little is heard in Bali of Vish\u1e47u's heaven; it is known rather from tradition than from religious doctrine. Every man endeavours to reach \u015aiva's heaven (which is to be sought on the Kail\u0101sa, the Meru, or the Gunung Agung, in Bali, at its highest point); but only a Padanda appears to have a right to immediate entry therein. The rest of the people have to be satisfied with Svarga, Indra's heaven, where they hope to live forever, entirely after the Balinese manner of living, but without care and with greater splendour. The attainment of the Svarga is in some cases immediate; a Beli or Satia who follows her husband into the fire, passes into that heaven at once; a prince, who sacrifices himself and his adherents in defence of his country, goes with all his followers to Indra's heaven, where, probably, they fall again to fighting. Cremations also, if they be accomplished according to rule\u2014which is difficult, as the priests can very easily discover a fault, if they have not been consulted as to all ceremonies, however insignificant\u2014are considered to bring the subject of the cremation to Svarga. But this last means of entry is not looked upon as so certain as the two others; the Balinese say of several princes that, although they were burnt with all proper ceremony, they still wander upon earth in the form of animals (frogs, snakes, &c.). Another obstacle is the judicial power of Yama, who judges the dead with strict impartiality in the lower world (Naraka). Perhaps the postponement of cremations for two months, and sometimes for several years (up to twenty), has reference to this preliminary judgment by Yama, and the punishments imposed by him; here, however, as is the case in most religions, there is a palpable inconsistency: it is believed that the souls of the dead, provided that no outward observances have been neglected, pass immediately into Svarga; it is at the same time believed that the soul must first be judged by Yama (the Indian Pluto, and the lord, Jehovah, who, according to the Old Testament, will punish Jewish sinners), and must, for all sins, perform penances which will last millions of years, and which hinder them from reaching Svarga. Doceant theologi meliora!\n\nBaruna (Sansk. Varuna) is the god of the sea; the temples on the sea-coast are dedicated partly to him and partly to \u015aiva. Vish\u1e47u also is stated to be a sea-god, or god of water (represented in India on this account with the inverted tris\u016bla), but he has no\ntemples either in this or in his other capacities. The subordinate Baru\u1e47a, however, for the same reason as Indra, is not erased from the list of the gods who are worshipped. Baru\u1e47a is sometimes represented as a youth, in the same manner as Indra. He is then distinguished by the p\u0101\u015ba. This should really be a sling, with which he catches up the dead bodies, &c., and Yama the souls; in Bali, however, the p\u0101\u015ba, contrary to the meaning of the word, is a long dart, round which a serpent winds, and which ends in three teeth (like the tri\u015b\u016bla). Baru\u1e47a has usually a monstrous figure with the head of a R\u0101ksasa, from which a serpent\u2019s tongue projects, and a huge serpent\u2019s tail turning upwards, the rest of the body being human. This serpent-form indicates his nature as sea-god. The deva agun sagara (agun must be agung; Crawfurd, On the Island of Bali, \u201cAsiat. Res.\u201d vol. xiii.) is the same as Varuna.\n\nYama, the god of death and of punitive justice, is identified with \u015aiva (and K\u0101la); he has no special worship, but \u015aiva is also worshipped under the name of Yama. He is called sang hyang Darma (justice); and Pr\u0113tar\u0101ja (the prince of the departed). His severe punishments (e.g. the boiling of a soul in a copper kettle for thousands of years) are very well known. He is regarded as a god, not as a R\u0101ksasa, although he has teeth on his cheeks and his forehead (dangstra, comp. Gane\u015ba), and, besides this, the well-known tusks of the R\u0101ksasas (siyung or chaling); his symbol is the gad\u0101, club.\n\nThe rest of the gods of the cardinal points have, as it were, no worship. S\u016brya is the same as \u015aiva, and the worship of the priests is addressed to him; masuryasevana (worship of the sun). Chandra, the moon, in India an attribute of \u015aiva, did not become known to me as such in Bali, but all principal feasts are regulated according to the full and new moon. To insure success, all great undertakings (offerings, cremations) must be carried out in the first, or white, half of the moon. Anila or Vayu (Bal. Bayu) has no worship at all, but is regarded as the vital principle; in fasting (brata) the doer of penance shall live by the vayu alone. The vayu in its various forms come also under notice in the healing of the sick. The physician causes his vayu to pass into the sick man\u2019s body. The Padandas are, therefore, in great request for curing sick people, because their vayu is particularly holy.\n\nKuvera, the god of riches (Bal. Kubera), known only from the myths. Still less is known of Nirriti and I\u015b\u0101ni. Agni, finally, the god of fire, is frequently invoked in the Veda-worship in Bali, as in India, but has no temples, and is not worshipped by the people.\n\nTo the family of \u015aiva, but still as subordinate gods, belong Gane\u015ba and K\u0101rtikeya or Skanda, his sons. I have not yet become acquainted with the latter in Bali; of Gane\u015ba (commonly called Gaya), on the entrances, there are images of stone (Ganesa\nimages are introduced into Bali by Kabu Ayu; compare Abdullah in the T. v. N. I., 2, 161 seq.) and paintings, all tolerably rude. The stone images are sometimes to be found in the temples of \u015aiva, and Ga\u1e47e\u015ba then appears publicly as a subordinate, attendant deity, very much resembling the R\u0101ksasas that keep watch. Special worship and offerings for him are unknown. In literature, however, Ga\u1e47a is as important in Bali as in India. He is the god of learning and of cunning (also of the orang dagang and of thieves). He is called Ganapati, lord of hosts (he is the leader of the yet inferior gods); Vin\u0101yaka (the leader, in reference to the same idea); Sarv\u0101vigna (from sarva, all, and avigna, without obstacle\u2014i.e., he who overcomes all obstacles); Vignakarta (vigna, obstacle, karta probably from kri, to cut, to solve\u2014he who removes all obstacles). In the drawings which are made of him, he holds in his right hand the pustaka, a book of lontar leaves as a symbol of learning. Of the rest of his (Indian) attributes, with the exception of the moon, I have seen or heard nothing. He has an elephant's trunk (tulali) and elephant tusks (gading), and also the dangstra (which we have found in Yama), on his cheeks and forehead. It is only in Ga\u1e47e\u015ba and Yama that these misformed parts do not indicate a demoniacal nature; they belong otherwise only to the B\u016btas and R\u0101ksasas, and to gods who by choice assume demoniacal forms. All the rest of Ga\u1e47e\u015ba's body is entirely human, and he has only two arms, the reason of which we have already seen above in \u015aiva's case. Independently of the preference given to the worship of \u015aiva, the sole and supreme god, the absence of homage to Ga\u1e47e\u015ba may also be explained by his shape. Everything monstrous is regarded in Bali with a certain repugnance; it is true, the numerous representations of demons conflict with this statement, but then these are the hostile spirits, which are overcome in great measure by the beneficent gods. It is especially remarkable that the form of an elephant is looked upon as unlucky, although I cannot assert that this was always the case. A former prince of Boeleng kept an elephant and used to ride out upon it; his conduct was universally condemned, and to this is ascribed the fact that this prince was punished by the gods with the loss of his kingdom. The abhorrence of the tiger is more natural; if tigers make their appearance in a kingdom of Bali, it is believed that that kingdom will speedily fall (come under the dominion of the evil spirits).* The rhinoceros, on the contrary, enjoys great honour, although not in life. The Deva agung and also the prince of Lombok have asked the Netherlands Govern-\n\n* In the greater portion of Bali tigers do not occur; they swim over to Jembrana from Banyuwangi, and remain in that nearly uninhabited district and in the mountains of Tubanan and Boeleng. The high cultivation of the country prevents them from spreading further. Their appearance is a sign that men must depart.\nment for one of these animals for great sacrificial festivals; they use the blood and fat for the preparation of various offerings, and the excrementa as medicine.\n\nK\u00e2ma, the god of love, and his wife Rati, have, so far as I know, no special temples, but yet are much honoured among this very erotic people. K\u00e2ma also is again, as it were, a form of Siva (see \"Us. Bali,\" p. 275). Other names of K\u00e2ma are sang hyang Smara (about equal to the Latin cura, for \"to be in love\"); also Anangga, the bodiless, for, according to a myth, Siva has burnt his body; and Manobu, born in the heart.\n\nVasuki, the Indian serpent-king, nearly coincides here with Ananta (eternity), or Antabhogga, the serpent upon which Vishnu rests. Vasuki also belongs here to Siva's retinue; he dwells in the various principal temples in which Siva is worshipped (in the sadkahyangans). After the time of worship in Basuki, at the foot of the Gunong agung (which place is named after the same serpent), it is supposed that he goes through the air to Uluvatu, the sanctuary on the point of the table-land (in Badong), and so round to the other Kahyangans as well. He is then to be seen as a fiery streak in the sky. The brightness comes from the precious stones with which his immense head is adorned. Many apparently meaningless fables exist about Vasuki (in Bali always called gasuki). As yet I have not succeeded in extracting the \"sachen aus diesen sagen.\" I have long thought of a former serpent-worship, especially as a Padan\u00e2ga is also called Bujangga (serpent), and in the \"Usana Java,\" Siva, Buddha, and Bujangga are called sons Sang of Haji (adia, as it seems to me, \"the first\"), a circumstance which indicates very strongly the existence of three different forms of worship\u2014viz., the purely Sivaitic, the Buddhistic, and the serpent-worship (?). Of purely Indian myths, that of a former destruction of the serpents, in which Taksaka, Vasuki, and a third, at the prayer of a penitent, alone were spared, is known in Bali from the books. This sacrifice of serpents (Sarpayaj\u00f1a) was accomplished by king Janamejaya, the great-grandson of Arjuna Vijaya (compare the R\u00e2ksasa-Yaj\u00f1a of Bagavan Vasta). The bird of Vishnu Garuda is frequently represented in Bali, always in monstrous R\u00e2ksasa shape, with a beak and wings, but at the same time with tusks; in other respects it has a human body. His parents are Ka\u015byapa and Vina\u1e6da; Aruna is his brother. The most inferior persons of the Indian mythology, such as Kinnara, Kimpurusha, Uraga (serpents), Detya, Dunava, Pi\u015b\u0101cha, and others, are known in the literature of Bali. For the most part, however, we meet only with the Gandarvas, the Vidyadars, and Apsaras, in Indra's heaven, and the Detyas as giants of antiquity; the R\u00e2ksasas and Bh\u016btas (real beings, evil spirits) as enemies of mankind and opponents of the beneficent gods, dreaded, yet always to be propitiated.\nIn the last-mentioned we clearly recognize the principle occurring in all religions, of a good and an evil supreme power, the conflict between which in the Hindu doctrine, it would seem, is never, and never will be, decided. A union, however, of the two powers is clearly apparent in the fact that K\u0101la and Durg\u0101, the heads of the R\u0101ksasas and Bh\u016btas, are regarded as no other than \u015aiva and his wife, since the gods possess the power to change the latter into R\u0101ksasas.\n\nThe accounts relating to the Bh\u016btas are confused; there are a great number of names for a few of them\u2014e.g., buta Vilis, buta Lavehan;* they are also named after the shape which they assume\u2014e.g., butu hulu asu, \u201cthe buta with a dog\u2019s head\u201d (asu, Sansk. \u015bv\u0101, dog), buta hulu lombu, \u201cthe buta with the head of a cow.\u201d A collective Balinese name is dagan; their haunts are chiefly burial-grounds and unclean places, and at night they break into the houses which are not protected from them by means of offerings. With the people in general the Liaks\u00b9 are still more common than the Bhutas. The former are human beings, who, by the knowledge of certain mantras (magic formularies), can alter their shapes and also render themselves invisible, a bright light proceeding from the place of the tongue, alone remaining; they are obliged to feed on carcases, and chiefly haunt burial-grounds and the places where corpses are kept for cremation. They also take out the entrails of sleepers, so that the person thus robbed must die in a short time. Their mistress is Rangda ning Gira, the widow of Gira, whose history is found in the Chalon-Arang (a Babad); she lives on the Gunung agung, where the Liaks hold their assemblies. Fire-flies, which are very numerous and of large size in Bali, are sometimes said to be Liaks; moreover, the accusation of being a Liak often affords reasons for declaring a person to be innocent.\n\nThe Creation.\n\nAccording to the Brahm\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dapur\u0101\u1e47a, where the world is created from an egg (anda), four beings come first into existence, through the penance performed by Brahm\u0101; two of these are \u015aananda and Sanatkum\u0101ra, and the other two are not named. Then the heavens, the rivers, the sea, the mountains, plants, shrubs, time, &c., come into existence. He (Brahm\u0101) further creates the Devarshi (the divine Rishis), Marichi, Brigu, Anggira, Pulasty\u0101, Pulaha, Kratu, Daksha, Atri, Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha. It is not till he has done this that he creates the Param\u0113\u015bvara, the Supreme Lord, a name for \u015aiva; the latter is at once regarded as Brahm\u0101\u2019s grandfather! He is called Bava, nature; Sarva, all; I\u015ba, lord; Bima, the terrible one; Mah\u0101deva, the great god. His body\n\n* Also Klika, servant of Durg\u0101 (in India K\u0101lik\u0101 is another name for Durg\u0101). Klika was probably originally the same person as Durg\u0101.\n\n\u00b9 [Wilken, l. l. p. 22; and R. van Eck, \u201cBalineesch Woordenboek,\u201d s. v. lejak.]\nconsists (1) of \u0100ditya-\u015aar\u012bra, sun-body; (2) Ve\u015bar\u012bra, water-body; (3) B\u0101yu\u015bar\u012bra; (4) Agni\u015bar\u012bra, fire-body; (5) \u0100k\u0101\u015ba, the higher invisible heaven; (6) Mah\u0101pandita, the great Pandita; (7) Candra, the moon; (8) Ba\u1e6dara Guru, the teacher. He is therefore called Ashtatanu, with eight bodies. He must be worshipped through the S\u0101dhaka, the full priest, or the performer of the ceremonies. Kalpa, form, and Dharma, justice, are children of Brahm\u0101, sprung from his spirit. It is stated here from which parts of the body of Brahm\u0101 the Devarshis came forth.\n\nThe lord then created the gods (Devas), the Asuras (evil spirits), the Pitris (shades), and man. He also creates out of his own body the Yaksha, a sort of demon; Pi\u015b\u0101cha, lemures; Uraga, the serpents which are worshipped; Gandharva, heavenly musicians; Apsaras, the heavenly female dancers; Gana, the hosts, whose leader is Ga\u1e47apati; Kinnara, elves; R\u0101k\u1e63asa, demons; and, finally, the animals, pa\u015bu.\n\nThen the four castes are created: the Br\u0101hmans, out of Brahm\u0101\u2019s mouth; the Kshatriyas, out of his arm; the Vesya\u015b (Vai\u015byas), out of his thigh; and the \u015a\u016bdras, out of his foot. Then Dharma (the Dharma already mentioned above), and Ahings\u0101 (husband and wife), justice and the sparing of everything that is alive; these are the two principal virtues of the Buddhists. It appears, therefore, that in the ancient combination of Brahmanism and Buddhism in Java, Buddhistic doctrines crept even into the Brahm\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dapur\u0101\u1e47a. I cannot say for certain, however, whether these are not found in the Indian Brahm\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dapur\u0101\u1e47a as well, this work being hitherto but little known to Europeans. (There are many repetitions in the manuscript.) Then Svayambhuva Manu, (\u201cthe first Manu,\u201d\u2014the Manus govern the world during a certain period, kalpa, \u201cfrom the one creation to the other\u201d) and ba\u1e6diri Satarupa are created; they beget the ba\u1e6diri Rati, the wife of K\u0101ma, the god of love. Then follows the genealogy of the race of Svayambhuva Manu and their relationships with the nine Devarsis. The descendants include twelve Yamas, and Lak\u1e63mi (in India, Vish\u1e47u\u2019s wife). Buddha is the son of Buddhi, the understanding. The rest of this race are attributes of nature, of the mind, the heart, and also the body. Nilalohita (Siva) has a thousand children, the Sahasra Rudra. \u015ar\u012b is the daughter of the Devarshi Brigu, married to Vish\u1e47u; their children are Bala and Buddana. Sarasvat\u012b is the wife of P\u016brvam\u0101sa, the full moon. Agu is the son of bagav\u0101n Anggira and Sm\u1e5bti, tradition; among his descendants is Parjanya, the god of rain. The holy Pulaha is the ancestor of the Kshatriya Daha, the warrior-caste of Daha or Kediri: this royal family, represented in Java in Majapahit, and in Bali in the race of the Deva Agung, thus derives its origin from a Devarshi, and ought properly to belong to the Brahman caste. They are the grandchildren of K\u016bmy\u0101 and Priyabrata.\nThe 60,000 B\u0101lakhilyas, who are all Brahmach\u0101ri\u2014i.e., students of the Vedas (compare the 60,000 S\u0101garides in the B\u0101lak\u0101nda of the Indian R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a), are children of Kratu and Sannati. Besides a great number of other mythological personages who do not appear in the religious worship, but are sacred to the Brahmins, we find here the seven Rishis, who existed in the time of Uttama Manu, the second successor of Sv\u0101yambhuva Manu; they are R\u0101ja, Batra (Badra), Urddab\u0101hu, Lavana, Anaya, \u015aatapa, and \u015aaka, and are descended from the Devarshi Vasishtha.\n\nWe give here a few examples from the original:\n\nAgre sasarjja bhagav\u0101n m\u0101nasam \u0101tmanah samam.\n\n\"In the beginning the holy one created the soul, which was like unto himself.\" This is explained thus: mayoga bat\u0101ra Brahm\u0101 m\u2019tu tang Resi patang siki sang Nandana Sanatkum\u0101ra. \"Bat\u0101ra Brahm\u0101 held the yoga (was sunk in meditation), thereby originated the Resis, four in number: sang Nandana and Sanatkum\u0101ra.\" The other two are not named; according to the Indian tradition, however, S\u0101nanda (sic) and Sanatkum\u0101ra are two of the four first-born sons of Brahm\u0101. It still remains to be investigated whether the sons of Brahm\u0101 are representatives of the (world-) soul, which, with the means at present at my disposal, I am not in a position to do.\n\nTatwasrijat punah Brahma.\n\n\"After that Brahma created again.\" Here follows in the Balinese commentary the creation of \u015aiva, and an enumeration of his different characteristics and bodies. This, then, appears to be an interpolation into the original work; the Sanskrit text says nothing about it, and this creation is certainly not in its proper place. But with a sect such as that in Bali, \u015aiva could not be created later on without losing importance; therefore advantage was taken of the Sanskrit words, which scarcely any one understood, to glorify \u015aiva by means of an incorrect commentary. Tatwa has been formed here out of tato-asrijat; the a has not been elided, but has been altered with the preceding o into wa; in the Sanskrit the word should be tato-srijat. This Tatwa occurs again in the next half-\u015bloka, but there it can only be explained by tath\u0101 \"so,\" \"in the same manner.\"\n\nTatwa dev\u0101surapitrin manushyako-srijat prabhu.\n\n\"So also the Lord created the gods (Deva), the Asuras, the Pitaras, mankind.\"\n\nIn Manushyako (see above) there must be an error; m\u0101nusyaka is a \"multitude of men,\" but this does not suit either the sense or the metre in this passage; had it to be brought into the metre, it would be manushyakam asrijat prabhuh, which gives a syllable too many; moreover the \u1e6d\u1e0dung (the sign of the long \u0101) is wanting in\nthe manuscript. We have altered the Sanskrit text into *manushy\u0101n\u015bcha* \u201cand the men (mankind),\u201d which agrees admirably with the sense, and leaves the metre undisturbed. Our passage is reproduced in the Balinese commentary thus:\n\nMuwah mayoga bat\u0101ra Brahma, mijil sang deva sura pitr\u0113 manus\u0101, tuhun sangkanika mijil saking manah hikang deva, ring lambung sangkaning pitr\u0113, ring pasva sangkaning manus\u0101, jagana sangkaning Asura.\n\n\u201cAnd further was bat\u0101ra Brahma sunk in meditation; thereby came into existence the *Devas*, *Asuras*, *Pitaras*, and mankind; the place whence they sprung (out of his body) was: the *Devas* came forth out of his mind (manas); the *Pitaras* out of the hollow under his arm; man out of his side (for *pasva* we must read *par\u015bwa*); his thigh was the place whence the *Asuras* came forth.\u201d\n\nThe time also when they came into existence is stated, and this certainly has an astronomical meaning, since in India also the *Devas* and *Asuras* play an important part in astronomy (see Bentley on the Indian Astronomy). The *Asuras* are born at noon, *man* in the morning, the *Devas* at midnight, and the *Pit\u0101-Pitarah* (the worshipped shades of the departed) in the evening.\n\nWe will add a brief sketch of the survey of the world as it appears in the *Brahm\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dapur\u0101\u1e47a*.\n\nThe world is divided into seven *Dv\u012bpas* (islands): *Pushkara-dv\u012bpa* (the lotus-island), *Kronchadv\u012bpa*, *Ku\u015badv\u012bpa*, *Sangkadv\u012bpa* (Skt. *S\u0101kadv\u012bpa*), *\u015aalmalidv\u012bpa*, *Plakshadv\u012bpa*, *Jambudv\u012bpa*. The last, the island of the *jambu*-fruit, is India and the adjoining countries. All these islands are surrounded by the ocean, and lie round about *Meru*, the centre of the earth, like lotus-leaves. The islands are under the rule of the grandsons of *\u015av\u0101yambhuva Manu*, the first of the seven *Manus*, who govern the earth for the space of a *kalpa*, a long period of time (see below). They are named *Savana*, *Jutiman*, *Vapushmanta*, *Medh\u0101tithi*, *Gomeda*, *Arya* and *Agnidhra*. The last rules over *Jambudv\u012bpa*. *Jambudv\u012bpa* itself is divided into nine *varshas*, more or less distant from *Meru*, which is sometimes to be regarded as the North Pole, and sometimes as the centre of the earth; great ranges of mountains, mostly fabulous, divide these *varshas* from each other. The children of *Agnidhra* are (1) *Nabi*, (2) *Kimpurusha*, (3) *Harivarsha*, (4) *Il\u0101vrita*, (5) *Ramya*, (6) *Hirayaka*, (7) *Kuru*, (8) *Bhadra*, (9) *Ketum\u0101la*. Most of these nine also give their names to the *varshas*, over which they preside. (1) The land (the *varsha*) of *Nabi* is to the south of the *Himav\u0101n* (*Himalaya*); this is therefore India proper. (2) Between *Himav\u0101n* and *Hemak\u016b\u1e6da* (the golden peak) is *Kinnaravarsha*, under the prince *Kimpurusha*. The *Kinnaras* or *Kimpurushas* (literally \u201cwhat sort of man\u201d) are barbarous nations in the north of India, represented with horses\u2019 heads; they are a sort of centaur, and indicate the nomadic equestrian nations of the north.\nThe Hemak\u016bta is a mountain range to the north of the Him\u0101layas, in Tibet; it is not loftier than the Himalayas, but is represented as being so. In this range also is the fabulous Kail\u0101sa, \u015aiva\u2019s seat. (3) Naishadavarsa: Naishadha is a range of mountains to the east of Hemak\u016bta and south of Il\u0101v\u012bta. A country in the south-east of India also bears the name of Nishadha, well known through its prince Nala (Naishadha, in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata\u2014the episode is published by Bopp). Here, however, we have to do with the northern Nishadha, of which Harivarsha is prince. (4) Il\u0101v\u012bta (or Hil\u0101v\u012bta) the name of prince, country, and mountain range. This is the highest and most central range on the earth, according to Indian ideas; Meru, the highest mountain and the seat of the gods, is situated in it. (5) The region north of Il\u0101v\u012bta and Nilaparvata, called Ramyaka or Nilavarsha. Nilaparvata, the blue mountains, are as mysterious as Il\u0101v\u012bta with Meru: we do not find either in the position indicated by the Indians, but we may perhaps suppose the Aryans (\u0100rya, the Indian), who descended to the plains of India from the mountainous regions of the north-west, to have brought with them some knowledge of the ranges (Altai, Caucasus) of northern and western Asia. (6) Hiranyakavarsa to the north of \u015avetaparvata, the white mountains, northwards of Nilaparvata. (7) Kurivarsha to the north of the \u015aringav\u0101n range; this is the Uttara-Kuru, the most northern and the coldest land, but the land whence the Aryans appear originally to have come. According to the Zendmyth, it was in ancient times a fertile, inhabitable land, and was changed into a cold wilderness by \u0100hriaman (the evil spirit). In this may, perhaps, be recognized a trace of a remembrance of the changes which have taken place in the climates of our earth, such as that to which the fossil bones found in Siberia bear witness. (8) Bhadravarsha, to the west of the M\u0101lyav\u0101n (the flowery mountain), which itself lies to the east of the Meru. Bhadravarsha is thus by the side and to the eastward of the great chains of mountains. (9) Ketum\u0101la dwells to the east of mount Gandam\u0101dana (delightful to the smell). This is the country lying to the west of the other Varshas (Persia?). We, therefore, have (1) India proper, as far as the Him\u0101layas; (2) the region between the Him\u0101layas and Hemak\u016bta (Tibet); (3) the region between Hemak\u016bta and Il\u0101v\u012bta (with Meru); in our enumeration this is No. 4 (Tartary, Mongolia?); (4) the region to the north of Nilaparvata, north-east of the Meru (Eastern Mongolia, Manchuria?); (5) the region to the north of \u015avetaparvata, north of the previous country (Eastern Siberia?); (6) Uttara-Kuru (northern and western Siberia to the Arctic Ocean). These six form almost a continuous series from south to north, with the Meru as a centre. Then come to the east Nilavarsha (China?) and Bhadravarsha, and to the west Ketum\u0101lavarsha (Per-\nConcerning the rest of the varshas nothing further is mentioned; the narrative proceeds to enumerate the princes who ruled in India proper, descendants of Nabi, the eldest son of Agnidhra. Nabi is an Emperor, the universal ruler; he is also a Kshatriya. From Nabi and his wife Manudevi are descended successively (1) Rishaba, (2) Bharata, who dwells south of the Himav\u0101n in Bharatavarsha, (3) Sumati, (4) Tejasa, (5) Indradyumna, (6) Parameshthi, (7) Pratihara, (8) Pratiharsha, (9) Unnata, (10) Bhava, (11) Mudgita, (12) Pra\u015bastavi, (13) Vibhu, (14) Prithu, (15) Nakta, (16) Gaja, (17) Jara, (18) Vir\u0101t, (19) Diman, (20) Mahan, (21) Bochara, (22) Toshta (Tushta), (23) Viraja, (24) Raja, (25) Tus (!). These are the Kshatriyas (princes) in the second great period of the world's existence, Tret\u0101yuga. Several of these names are those of the Jaina deities; the Jainas are disguised Buddhists, who still exist in India. These names give us a hint towards the comprehension of Buddhism in Java. Were the Buddhists of Java Jainas; and have we to attribute to that sect the union of the Buddhistic and Sivaitic religions and doctrines in Java and Bali? The Jainas at any rate worship the Brahmanical gods besides the Jainas, and have even retained the institution of the castes in order to protect themselves from the persecutions of the followers of Brahma.\n\nUnder Svayambhuva Manu there are further eleven Rudras (see the feast of Ekada\u015barudra), twelve Adityas (the twelve solar months), eight Basus (Sanskrit Vasu or Vasudeva), twelve Sadhyas, ten Visvadevas, two Sanggis (?), twelve B\u0101rgawas. And further there are the Devas, Asuras, Gandharvas, Yakshas, Pi\u015b\u0101chas, R\u0101kshasas: these are immortal, it is true, but yet are born again. Their lifetime and that of man varies according to the different yugas (Satya, or Krita-, Treta-, Dv\u0101para-, Kaliyuga), and gradually decreases. In the Tret\u0101yuga man attains the age of 188 years, at the close of the Tret\u0101yuga 147, in the Dv\u0101parayuga 126, at the close of the same 105, and in the Kaliyuga only 84. The lifetimes of the inferior gods differ in the same proportion. The angulas (inches) are given as the measure of time, but at present I am without any explanation of their astronomical meaning. Hereupon the work speaks of the Manvantaras, the periods of time in which a Manu governs; these are also called kalpa, and they contain seven chaturyugas; according to the work this appears to be the time of one Manu, but the latter is really but one chaturyuga (a combination of the four Yugas, a Kalpa); there are, however, seven Manus, and the seven chaturyugas are, in fact, the time of the duration of the world. After each kalpa or chaturyuga the world is destroyed and created again.\n\nHere follows a description of Chaos. Manu alone was in existence. He (not Brahma) then creates a series of beings; Deva, Rishi, Asura, Pit\u1e5bi, Manusha, Bh\u016bta, Pi\u015b\u0101cha, Gandharva,\nYaksha, and R\u0101kshasa. Manu is called here Sumantia (?) and sang Sista (the instructor). He instructs* the beings who through his penance have come into existence, in the Sad\u0101ch\u0101ra (the right conduct); this consists of lobh\u0101deya (lobha, \"greedy desire,\" sensuality, covetousness, and \u0101deya, probably from \u0101d\u0101, sumere, tollere; thus \"the putting away of greedy desire\")\\(^1\\); k\u1e63ham\u0101 (patience), satya (truth, truthfulness), vidy\u0101 (knowledge), ijj\u0101 (the making of offerings), d\u0101na (alms-giving). The attributes of the Sad\u0101ch\u0101ra are seven in number (Saptak\u0101ni charitr\u0101ni).\n\nThe stages in the life of a Brahman are also given: (1) Brahmac\u0101r\u012b, he who lives as a pupil with his Guru; (2) Grihastha, the head of a family, the married man, whose duty it is to exercise the dharma (right); this consists principally in rearing a son, who must make offerings for his forefathers (Pitarah), and in hospitality; (3) Vaikh\u0101nasa, the hermit in the forest-hermitages (\u0101\u015brama); (4) Yati, an ascetic, who has brought into subjection all that is sensuous, and only occupies himself with yoga (meditation). They are also called in India Sanuy\u0101si, and are saints. The Yati is further called S\u0101dhaka; this word, which is also used as a title of the Padandas, is not found in Wilson; but S\u0101dhan\u0101 means, among other things, accomplishment, and good works, or the moral doctrine and the ceremonies of the Hindu religion, as a means for attaining purity and release from the transmigration of the soul. S\u0101dhaka, then, is \"some one who performs these good works.\" In our work the name S\u0101dhaka is explained as \"he who exercises the \u0101\u015brama-dharma (the right or custom of the hermits).\" We have, moreover, explanations of Dharma and Adharma (right and wrong). Further, \u015aruti (revelation) and Sm\u1e5biti (tradition) are mentioned. The former is like Dharmas\u0101stra (the book of instruction in right), and is said to be dh\u012br\u0101gnihotra-vijya (vijya, derived, beginning from; dh\u012bra, agni, hotra, the maintenance of a continual fire); it thus has reference also to the fire-worship. The sm\u1e5biti is the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-\u0101ch\u0101ra (var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama is here perhaps an error for van\u0101\u015brama, forest-hermitage); thus \"the mode of life, the example of the forest-hermitages.\" To these hermitages the ancient tradition was handed down. The seven Rishis shall teach the Dharmadvaya (the double right; Dharma and Adharma (?)) or rather \u015aruti and Sm\u1e5biti) on the earth in the time of P\u016brva Manu (= Svayambhuva ?). The Dharmadvaya is the contents of the Chaturveda (the four Vedas), according to which the S\u0101dhu (the good man) regulates his life. It contains also the Da\u1e47\u1e0dan\u012bti (the regulation of punishments), the Trayi (the three Vedas without the Atharvaveda; we had just now all four Vedas, but these inaccuracies often recur), and the Var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama (here also var\u1e47a takes the place of vana). Does var\u1e47a perchance convey the idea of a caste? and\n\n* He is here the Guru; the deity (\u015aiva) appears in Java and Bali chiefly in this character.\nthe var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama mean the regulation of the life (the four periods) of all castes? In general the passage before us speaks only of the Brahmans.\n\nThe word \u015aruti is explained by: \"ri denian kinatuturan,\" because she is learned, she is called \u015aruti. Sm\u1e5biti, makanimitta ri kang\u0113n-ang\u0113nira matangian Sm\u1e5biti ngarania, on account of her amiableness she is named Sm\u1e5biti. The name Smara (love, the god of love) and a signification of the root sm\u1e5bi, \"desiderare, to desire, to like,\" have obviously led to the latter explanation.\n\nThe characteristics of the Satya-Brahmach\u0101ri (of the true Brahman pupils) are: Tapah (penance), Mona (Sanskrit m\u0101una, to be silent), Yajna (to make offerings), D\u0101ya (the receiving of alms), K\u1e63am\u0101 (patience), Alobha (freedom from desire), Dama (subjugation, i.e., of sins), Sama (repose of the soul), Jit\u0101tm\u0101 (victory over the \u0101tm\u0101, the passions), D\u0101na (almsgiving), Anamah (not to greet; this is forbidden to the Brahmans, because they would lower themselves by bowing their heads, &c.), Advesha (freedom from hate), Ari\u1e45ga (freedom from affections). He is virakta (freed from sensuousness), ty\u0101ga (relinquishes all earthly power and gives them away), vij\u00f1\u0101na (knows the differences, has things to discriminate, or shrewdness). These characteristics are called dharmapratyangalakshana, the names (or signs) of the organs of the Dharma.\n\nIti-uktang tatvancha sarvang, dharmapratyangalakshanang.\n\nSo is the whole Tatva (dogma) related, which contains the names of the organs of the Dharma.\n\nThis is not the place to speak more fully of the contents of the Brahmapur\u0101\u1e47a; it is to be hoped that in a short time they may be fully worked out. We will conclude with a note on the contents of the Vedas.\n\nThe three Vedas (here also the fourth is not mentioned), Rig, Yajuh, and S\u0101ma, contain four Stotras (stotra is praise), namely, (1) Dravya- (Wilson, \"elementary substance;\" there are nine kinds); (2) Gu\u1e47a- (the three qualities which penetrate all beings, viz., Satva, reality, truth; Rajas, passion; Tamas, darkness, ignorance, badness); (3) Karma- (the works, actions, the practical part, the offerings); (4) Bijana-Stotra (this must be abhijana, \"family, race\" (Wilson). It is thus the genealogical part).\n\nReligious Ceremonies and Offerings.\n\nThe five daily offerings which the head (grihastha) of every Indian family has to make, are not found in Bali. The Panditas read (or mumble) the Vedas once a day; the people make their offerings and say their prayers on certain days. The religious\n\n1 [The duties concerning the castes and stages of life are meant.]\n2 [Probably meant for vijn\u0101na, discernment, or the intellectual part.]\nceremony consists in bringing offerings, which are offered with a sembah and deposited in front of the small temple-houses; in the ordinary temples this is mostly done by women, to whom is also entrusted the preparation of the various offerings. The act of offering is connected with mantras (forms of prayer), which, however, are not said aloud. On great feasts the offerings are presented by \"tandakking\" persons inspired by a deity, wawalen or prakulit (see \"Us. Bali,\" p. 335, balian = wawalen). These offerings are coupled with \"tandakking\" with the creese, which indicates that the offerer is ready to offer up his life. The offerings are very numerous, and are specially appointed for each feast and each deity; one usually sees various preparations of rice, cooked meats, fruits, sirih, kwekwe, money (Chinese \"cash\"), clothes, and also drinks.\n\nBloody sacrifices are made to Durg\u00e2 and the B\u00fbtas; they are usually confined to hens, ducks, and young pigs, although in great sacrifices, buffaloes, goats, deer and dogs are slaughtered. The persons offering the sacrifice eat the flesh of the three first-mentioned animals, and only offer the skin and bones and portions of the flesh, boiled or roasted; they also dress the flesh of the dogs (sasate), but, according to their own statements, they do not eat any of this, the whole animal being intended for the B\u00fbtas. On the feast of Bayakala every family kills a pig, and the skin and blood are deposited in the courtyards of the houses for K\u00e2la and the B\u00fbtas. The flesh, however, is in this case also used as food by the persons making the offering. Besides these offerings the temple is sprinkled with holy water (toya tirta). This water is bought from the Panditas, who consecrate it by reading the Vedas. The persons offering also use this holy water to purify themselves, to rinse their mouths and to sprinkle their faces. We have in Bali, it is true, the toya Sindu (water of the Indus), at the foot of the Gunung agung in Basuki, and also a Gangg\u00e2 in Tabanan, but the priests do not regard this water as holy. They know that these rivers are in Kling (India), and that they cannot obtain the water thence, but this want is supplied by mumbling the Vedas. Besides the Gangg\u00e2 and Sindu, all the great Indian rivers are known in Bali: the Yamun\u00e2, Narmad\u00e2 (Nerbudda), Kaveri (near Seringapatam), the Saray\u00fb, the river of Ayodhya (Oude), and others. The holy water produced by the Panditas is called Mrita or Amrita (Ambrosia, immortal, life-giving food). This water has Ku\u015ba-grass soaked in it. The Padanda also strews Ku\u015ba-grass soaked in holy water over the persons who make the offerings. The Ku\u015ba-(or Darba-)grass is also used to lay the offerings upon. Ghrita (Ghee) is likewise known here, but, for want of milk, is made of gooseberries. The Panditas, however, also use sometimes the milk of cows to prepare this; it ought\n\n1 [I.e., dancing with gesticulation.] 2 [Sanskrit bh\u00fbtas.]\nreally to be made of the milk of a *lembu putih*, a white cow with a hump; these animals are sacred; the common Balinese cow is not sacred, although it may not be eaten by the faithful. In *Badong* the Balinese are forbidden to kill cows, although it is done secretly, but in other States they are slaughtered openly. In order to be able to use the milk of these Balinese cows for *Ghrita*, the beast is tied up for a fortnight, and is given nothing but *Ku\u015ba*-grass to eat; this food renders the milk sacred, and especially purifies it from the smell of musk which the Balinese cows have. *Tila*-grass is also used, but is not known to the ordinary Balinese (see a passage in the *R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a*). *Madhu* (honey) also occurs in the offerings, and likewise perfumes, such as *m'ny\u0101n*, *maja gawu*, and *chandana* (see \"Us. Bali\").\n\nThe bloody sacrifices, as we have said, are chiefly dedicated to K\u0101la, Durg\u0101 and the B\u016btas, seldom to \u015aiva. In India \u015aiva demands blood almost entirely, but in Bali, as supreme deity, he has taken rather the mild form of Vishnu (and Buddha). The offerings, which on great feasts are numerous and of some value, do not remain in the temples, nor are they all given to the priests. The Padandas who conduct the service receive part of the clothes and money, and the offerings of eatable things, after being presented, are taken back with prayers and eaten at home as *Am\u1e5bita*, life-giving food, by the persons presenting the offering.\n\nThe Panditas besides this receive considerable sums of money for cremations and for being present at the offerings made by the princes; this money is presented to them as an offering itself (this also characterizes the Panditas as a kind of god upon earth). Most of the Padandas return a large portion of the offering made to them. The Panditas do not take any active part in the offerings; they indicate from their books, before the ceremony takes place, all the usages to be observed\u2014the quantity and preparation of the offerings, and the way in which they are to be presented; but during the ceremony they sit motionless, as they do in the domestic worship, mumbling the Vedas. By mumbling the Vedas they draw the attention of the gods to the offerings made by man, and cause the gods to look graciously upon them. The place where the Pandita sits is a high framework of bamboo, under a roof, and he has all the utensils for the *Suryasevana* by his side. To the form of worship belongs also the *Pradak\u1e63in\u0101*, the marching round the temple towards the right hand, which is done three times; it is only performed by the Panditas in the spirit, while their bodies remain all the time motionless. I have not yet observed this custom at offerings either, and it seems not to have penetrated to the popular worship of Bali, the Polynesian *tandakking* appearing to have taken its place, while the priests\n\n* Tandak, however, appears to be an Indian word; *tandu* is one of \u015aiva's doorkeepers, and master of dancing and mimicry; *tandaka* is a juggler; *tandava* \"dancing with violent gesticulation,\" as executed by \u015aiva and his followers.\nhave retained a remembrance of the original form of worship with Pradakshi\u1e47\u0101.\n\nDress of the Panditas.\n\nAt the great festivals of the princes, at the cremation of persons of high rank, and at the domestic worship on full and new moon, the Padanda has a special dress, very much resembling the articles with which the Javanese idols are adorned. They are clothed in the ordinary Balinese manner, the upper part of the body being naked (see the idols of the Bataviaasch Genootschap van Kunsten en Wetenschappen); the garment which hangs from the hips is on these occasions white. On his head he wears a red cap, which, however, may also be white; this is called Jat\u0101 (see the catalogue of Indian Antiquities, p. xxv.); Jat\u0101 is otherwise the head-dress of \u015aivaites, but not a covering for the head. This jat\u0101 has some resemblance to the head-dress of Bagawan Trinawindu (No. 145), and still more to the Glung Kurung of the Balinese representations of \u015aiva. It is wider at the top than at the bottom, and goes down lower at the back of the head than in front. I counted thirteen annular divisions, formed from the bottom upwards by narrow stripes of gold, which run round the flannel covering of the top. Upon asking whether these divisions and the number of divisions had any meaning, I was answered in the negative; but nevertheless I am disposed to believe that they have some connection with those which I have observed in the Merus (see above) in the temples. In the Merus I have never as yet counted more than eleven roofs; can it be that the Panditas assume still greater sanctity by having a greater number of storeys in their Jat\u0101, which I venture to regard as a kind of Meru? This, added to their name (\u015aiva), does not seem altogether improbable; their own Meru, the Meru of the Brahmins as it were, would then be higher than that of the gods adored by the people.\n\nAlong the edge of the Jat\u0101, across the forehead, runs a band, called in Bali Ke\u015b\u0101bhara\u1e47a, ornament of the hair, and in India Muk\u016b\u1e6da; it is covered with gold, and ornamented at short distances with S\u016bryak\u0101ntas* (according to Balinese ideas a sort of precious stone). In the centre of this Ke\u015b\u0101bhara\u1e47a, over the forehead, there is a Linga, in the form usual in Bali, and of crystal (or glass). At the extremity of the Jat\u0101 there is a ball, supporting a Linga (ball and Linga being of the same material as\n\n---\n\n* S\u016bryak\u0101nta (beloved by the sun), a precious stone, often meaning crystal, but really said to have proceeded from the rays of the sun. The Balinese S\u016bryak\u0101nta are of crystal or glass, and will be formed of pusakas of Majapahit. The fact that this precious stone is used for the S\u016bryasevana\u2014i.e., the worship of the sun\u2014is a further indication of the importance of this heavenly body. Another precious stone of fabulous origin is the Chandrak\u0101nta, proceeding from the condensed rays of the moon.\nabove). The fact that we here find the ball ornamented with the Linga is perhaps again a sign of the intermixture of Buddhism and \u015aivaism, in which, however, the \u015aivaitic symbol has the upper place. The Pandita wears in his ears the Ku\u1e47\u1e0dala; these are shaped like an egg, and are attached to the ear by a gold ring; it is sometimes of crystal.\n\nFor nearly all the remaining articles of his attire the name \u0101bhara\u1e47a is used, whereas in India each article has its particular name. We must not confound Kar\u1e47\u0101bharana (ear-ornaments) with the earrings; they are fastened behind the ear. \u0100tm\u0101-bhara\u1e47a (ornaments of the \u0101tm\u0101, the soul or the breath), a short band, worn round the neck, and on the breast on each side, with gold clasps of considerable size. V\u0101yubharana (ornaments of the wind; v\u0101yu, the wind, is the vital principle; the form v\u0101yu-bharana is incorrect, and should be v\u0101yubharana). These are double; they are worn round the neck, and are longer and fall lower down on the breast than the \u0100tm\u0101bhara\u1e47a. Hast\u0101bhara\u1e47a, as the name indicates, are worn round the wrists.\n\nThe guduha (or guduha genitri) is a kind of rosary; we find it in several of the Javanese idols; it is called in India aksham\u0101l\u0101 (string of beads). The name guduha does not appear to be Indian. The Pandita has two or three of these, and uses them on great festivals while he mumbles the Vedas, telling them after the manner of the Roman Catholics. All these ornaments, including the Brahman-band, which is called sampat, sawit, silimpit\u2014are strings of the fruit of the plant genitri (black balls about half an inch in diameter); their interstices are inlaid with gold, and at intervals they are set with S\u016bryak\u0101ntas.\n\nThe Brahman-band (not called here by an Indian name; perhaps it would be a profanation of this sacred ornament to make known to the people the Indian name Upav\u012bta or Yaj\u00f1opav\u012bta?) is threefold, but is not formed of three cords interwoven, and not of Munja-grass, which name is unknown here. There are three strings, passing over the left shoulder and under the right arm, and fastened together on the shoulder. At the place where they are joined there are three lingas (again of crystal). The ends hang down, and are ornamented with large precious stones\u2014one with a red stone, Pual\u0101 (doubtless Upal\u0101, opal); the second with a large (white) S\u016bryak\u0101nta; and the third with a black transparent stone, found in the mountains of Bali, and called manik girang-girangan. These three colours have reference to the three gods of the Trim\u016brti, Brahm\u0101, Vishnu, and \u015aiva (or Sad\u0101-\u015aiva, Pram\u0101-\u015aiva and Mah\u0101\u015biva). Red is the colour of Brahm\u0101, white of \u015aiva, black or dark blue of Vishnu (and also of K\u0101la). Besides this Brahman-band, the Pandita has also a band of white cloth, six yards long by three inches wide, which, like the other, is worn over the left shoulder and\nunder the right arm. This band is also called *sampat*, *sawit*, or *silimpat*.\n\nThe Pandita, finally, wears on his hands several gold rings with costly rubies. The ruby is the favourite stone in Bali, almost more prized than the diamond; seven kinds are known in Bali, each possessing a special supernatural power. On the upper part of the arm and on the ankles the Pandita wears no ornaments, but the gods do. The gods also have many of these ornaments in the form of serpents, which is not the case with the Panditas.\n\n**Dress of the Gods.**\n\nThe head-dress is very complicated, especially that of \u015aiva. \u015aiva alone of all the gods has the *Glung kurung*, a nearly spherical cap, much resembling the *Jata* of the Panditas, whose example \u015aiva is. This cap covers the back of the head. On the forehead is the *Glung chandi*, a round, lofty head-dress, nearly in the shape of the *chandis* in the temples. *Papudukan* are ornaments next to the *glung chandi*; *Garuda mungkur* above the *papudukan*. *Patitis* (among the Panditas *Ke\u015babharana*) is the forehead-band, set with precious stones; in front is the *chud\u0101ma\u1e47i*. *Mangle wijaya* (perhaps *mangala vijaya*, happy victory), the plain stripe above the *Patitis*. *Kun\u1e0dala*, the earrings. *\u015akar taji*, the pointed ornaments immediately behind the ear. *Ronron*, the ornaments behind the *\u015bkar taji*. *Apus kupak*, the ornaments on the shoulders. *Glangkana*, the bands on the upper part of the arm. *Glang*, the bands on the wrists. *Glang batis*, the bands on the ankles. *Bapang*, the small garment which hangs in two capes from the shoulders on to the upper part of the arms. *Kalung*, a short collar ornamented in silk with serpent-heads. *Sampat*, *Silimpat* or *Sawit*, also *Genitri* (after the name of the plant of the seeds of which it is made), the Brahman-band, worn, like that of the Panditas, over the left shoulder and under the right arm. *Bab\u00e9datti*, the breast-band, worn round the breast under both arms, and fastened in the middle with a jewel; this is also found on many Javanese idols. *N\u0101ga \u1e5bwangsul* (the serpent of Bali), a large band hanging from the shoulders to the stomach, formed of a serpent, worn in this way as the Brahman-band. *Babadong* (*badong*, the name of a kingdom, means, like *bandhana*, the Sanskrit name of it, \u201cconnexion\u201d), the upper band round the hips. *Tambedana*, two other bands worn round the body, below the *babadong*. *Kamben*, the cloth (not a *sarong*), unsewn, and fastened above the hips by the bands just mentioned. *Samir*, an end of the cloth, rolled up and sticking out above the *Tambedana*. *Jawat*, the end of the cloth which hangs down in front between the legs. *Lin\u010d\u00e9r*, two ends of the same hanging at the side. *Chalir*, short breeches (these\nare never worn by the Balinese, and are only seen in representations of mythological personages). \u015aiva and all the real gods sit or stand on a lotus-bed, *padm\u0101sana* (see, above, the *Padm\u0101sana* in the temples as a seat for \u015aiva). They have also a glory, surrounding the whole figure, called here simply *trang teja*, \"the bright lustre.\" All these ornaments can only be clearly explained by means of drawings, and I therefore caused the principal Balinese gods to be drawn by a Brahman; the first of these drawings which I sent were lost on the journey; those which I sent on the second occasion at any rate reached Batavia.\n\nThe costume just described is that of nearly all the gods; \u015aiva wears only the *Glung kurung* in front. This monotony also indicates that all the gods are merged in the one \u015aiva. In the female images we find other ornaments for the ears, and the cloth hangs down lower, as it is worn by the Balinese women. *Um\u0101*, \u015aiva's wife, has ornaments stuck through the lobe of the ear, named *Subong*; they are similar to those of most Balinese girls, which are made of lontar-leaves rolled together. She also has the *Glung chandi* of \u015aiva. *\u015ar\u012b*, Vishnu's wife, has the same ornaments, but a simple head-dress, called *Mengure glung*. Vishnu's earrings are called *rumbing*, and are round and without a cavity.\n\nIt is especially to be remarked here, that the names of the articles of the Panditas' dress are Sanskrit, while the names of those of the gods themselves are Balinese. The gods are thus less sacred than the priests! But the deity may not and cannot really be represented; drawings and images have no value but for the ignorant.\n\n**Feasts.**\n\nThese are partly feasts of the various gods and temples, and partly expiatory feasts. Those of the first kind are dedicated to the more beneficent gods, the others to the *B\u016btas* and *R\u0101ksasas*, with *K\u0101la* and *Durg\u0101* at their head. Especially grand feasts are celebrated in the *sadkahyangs*, the six most sacred temples in Bali. In the temples of *B\u0101suki* (or *Besaki*) at the foot of the *Gunung Agung*, the feast-day is every lunar year on the full moon (*P\u016brnam\u0101*) of the month *Kapat* or *K\u0101rttika*. This feast-day is really valid for all Balinese (\"Us. Bali,\" pp. 273 seq. and 346); but on account of the existing hostilities, *Badong* and *Tabanan* have not for a long time performed their worship, because the temple is in *Karang Asem*. In *Basuki*, *Mah\u0101deva* or *sang P\u016brva Jaya* (*\u015aiva*), whose seat is the *Gunung Agung* (or *Meru*), is worshipped.\n\nIn *Badong* the feast-day in the great sanctuary of *Uluwatu* is on the 21st day of the new (Balinese) year, *anggara kaliwon*, in the week *Madang Siha*. On this day the princes of *Badong*\nworship there, and to do this have to travel over the mountains to that holy place by wild and rocky paths. The holiness of this temple is ascribed to the fact that the ship (the prahu) of Dewi Danu, Mah\u00e2deva's sister when she came from India, stopped at that place and turned into stone. This temple, however, cannot be so old as that of Basuki; it is not named in the \"Us. Bali,\" p. 320; and it must further be taken into consideration that the feast day is fixed, not according to the Indian, but according to the Balinese year; while, on the contrary, in Basuki it is fixed according to the Indian calendar, and this seems to indicate that the temple of Badong is of later date. The same thing applies also to the temple of Sakennan or Serangan, dedicated to Indra. Here the feast is on Rediti Manis, in the week Langkir, the twelfth day of the Balinese new year.\n\nEach temple has likewise a feast on the date of its foundation. This is called wedalan, commonly pronounced odalan, or anniversary. General feasts of the gods and Pitaras are celebrated on Galungan, and in the five succeeding weeks (see \"Us. Bali\"). At this time the gods are supposed to dwell on the earth, and the Pitaras especially return to the bosoms of their families; hence the constant offerings and the incessant games and amusements which are regarded as necessary less for the living generation than for the Pitaras and gods sojourning among them; hence also the cessation from work and the disinclination to intercourse with foreigners during this period. Trade and foreigners are not agreeable to the Pitaras, who desire to see old institutions and usages faithfully preserved. The princes also have feasts on their birthdays, and on the anniversaries of their temples. The number and the preparation of the offerings is minutely prescribed for each deity and each temple.\n\nThe expiatory feasts, however, are those most worthy of attention. They are, in great part, celebrated, not in the temples, but in the inner portion of the houses (natar), or in places arranged for the purpose. We have already mentioned two great feasts: Bayak\u00e2la (see \"Us. Bali,\" p. 323 sqq.) and Panch\u00e2valikrama. This feast is not kept on fixed days in the year, but on great occasions. It occurs after the conquest of a State, for the sake of the conquered population, who are thereby delivered from the evil influence of the demons, who have power over conquered places; it also takes place before the abiseka (anointing) of the Sovereigns, and it is celebrated by all the princes and the men who bear arms. It is further observed after a contagious disease\u2014e.g., the smallpox. It is necessary that five Padandas should be present, four seated facing each of the cardinal points and one in the middle: one of the five must be a Padanda Buddha (a Buddhist priest), who sits facing the south. We have drawn attention above to this phenomenon, and may here observe that although Buddha is also represented at this feast, he plays but a subordinate part. To the north\nis Vishnu, whose colour is black; to the east Mah\u0101\u015bvara (white), to the south Brahma (red), to the west Mah\u0101deva (yellow), and in the middle \u015aiva, with mixed colours. (The offerings are of corresponding colours.) In the middle is the Padanda of the supreme \u015aiva, and he naturally has the chief place. There are three other priests of \u015aiva besides, but only one Buddhist.\n\nAnother expiatory feast is called Ekada\u015ba Rudra (the eleven Rudras; Rudra is a subordinate form of \u015aiva; eleven Rudras are also mentioned in Wilson). The origin of this feast, however, seems to be known to but few Balinese. (See \"Tijdschrift van N.I.\" VIII. vol. iii. p. 242, in which passage the name yajna, through a printer's error, is written jadjoeja.) The offerings enumerated there are the greatest known in India, but, according to the descriptions which I have obtained, they are not organized in Bali and Lombok precisely in the Indian manner. I was told that there were no bloody sacrifices in the feast in Lombok (September 1846); simply large sums of money were distributed among the priests and the people, and the ordinary offerings were presented.*\n\nIt appears, therefore, that only the names of these feasts have survived in the memory of the Balinese, and that the latter, in a spirit of vain-glory, apply these sacred names to their curtailed feasts, which they have not the means to make very grand.\n\nIt is a surprising fact, however, that by indirect inquiries I have convinced myself that a few human sacrifices have actually taken place in Bali! A former prince of Karang Asem, who was defeated in war, put one of his slaves to death in a forest, and then placed his body, concealed by clothes, among the other numerous offerings, as a means of imploring the gods to restore his power. The deed was discovered, for while the Pandita was mumbling the Vedas, a wind arose and uncovered the body. A curse fell upon the presumptuous prince, and he never regained his power. Another instance is known from Ganyar, where the prince (probably the first Deva Mangis, said to have been changed into a serpent on account of his atrocious acts) had set aside a slave\u2020 to be sacrificed; he intended to murder him in the darkness of the night, but killed by mistake his own son, and roasted and offered him as a sacrifice.\n\nThese two facts cannot well be gainsaid, for I have obtained the accounts of the former not only from Badong, but also from Mengwi, which is allied with and has long been friendly to Karang Asem. The people of Karang Asem utterly deny it. Of Ganyar\n\n* For the reader's convenience I will repeat the names:\u2014 1. \u0100\u015bvamedhayajna, the horse-sacrifice; 2. Gomedhayajna, the cow-sacrifice; 3. Manushyayajna, human sacrifice; 4. R\u0101jast\u012btyayajna, the sacrifice of the universal prince (i.e. offered by him); 5. Devayajna; 6. Rishiyajna; 7. Mutayajna; 8. Kauyasayajna; 9. R\u0101jabusa\u1e47ayajna.\n\n\u2020 Guling buntut is the name for human sacrifices.\nit is a common saying. How far this barbarity has gone, and, perhaps, still goes on in a thickly populated country, where the common man is a slave and of no value, I will not venture to say. The burning of widows, and also the amok on the fall of a State, must be classed among the human sacrifices.\n\nThe general name for these expiatory feasts is prayaschitta, commonly pronounced inaccurately prayas-tista. The word means, according to Wilson, expiation, penance; and thus is very appropriate. The Panch\u00e1valikrama is expressly included under this term. To these also belong the purification of a house in which a corpse has lain. The feast of the Sarasvati, on Sane\u015bchara, in the week of Watu gunung, has something in common with this; on that day the collective books of the princes are carried into the temple and purified for the coming year, through the priest reading the Vedas. Another feast is for the weapons, the ceremony being the same as in the previous one, and at this a bloody sacrifice to the B\u00fbtas is also necessary. Yet another feast is observed for the welfare of domestic animals, cows, horses, pigs, fowls, &c. Among the feasts belong also the cock-fights, not only as an amusement of the people, but also as a religious ceremony. At the feasts of the great temples\u2014e.g., the temple of assembly of the Gusti Pamchutan\u2014every one belonging to the congregation must send at least one cock, and must make it fight, either himself or through a deputy. This custom is based on the supposed incarnation of Vishnu as a cock (Silingsing) in Bali, but we can explain Vishnu\u2019s assumed incarnation more satisfactorily as an apotheosis, not derived from India, of the cock-fights which are so popular in all these islands.\n\nFurther Details of the Religious Worship.\n\nThe mangku (see \u201cUsana Bali,\u201d p. 267 sqq.) is the guardian of the temple, who superintends the edifice, and partly performs, partly conducts the presentation of offerings; he must know certain mantras\u2014e.g., patikelan ing genta sapta and s\u0101stra sangha, and must employ them when offerings are made. Both men and women can fill this post. (The Brahmanic women\u2014those sprung from the Brahmanic caste, not the concubines from the lower castes\u2014are likewise acquainted with the Vedas, and perform some religious functions instead of the men.) The mangkus can further be of various castes, and not S\u016bdras alone; I know several Gustis (Vesyas) in Badong, who fill the office of mangku; usually, however, these latter hold the post in the chief temples, such as, for instance, the domestic temples of the princes. I have not yet found a Brahman acting as a mangku; although perhaps there are some who do so. The Brahmans generally aspire to the dignity of a Padanda, and therefore look down upon the position of\na mangku. In order to become a mangku it is necessary, or at any rate usual, that a deity should pass into, and thenceforward speak from the body of the person selected. Two cases have become known to me in which young Gustis appeared for a time almost to have lost their reason, speaking an incomprehensible language, performing none of their actions in the ordinary manner, and sleeping in the temples. These Gustis were thereupon observed by the persons who had been longer inspired by a deity (wawalen or prakulit), and after due inquiry, acknowledged as also inspired. Such individuals are supposed to be either wawalens or actual madmen. When they are thoroughly penetrated by the deity, and have become calm again, they are true wawalen, and are able to state what deity it is that inspires them. They are then regarded as the most devoted servants (mangku) of the said deity. They become madmen if their minds do not become calm again\u2014or rather if their deception is not properly carried out; for, of course, these wawalen must be regarded as idle impostors, who choose to lead an easy life, chiefly at the expense of the credulous populace. (Compare on this subject \"Usana Bali,\" pp. 268 and 335.)\n\nThese temple-servants, however, detract nothing from the importance of the Panditas. The latter, by their life and the study of the Vedas, are identified both spiritually and materially with the supreme Siva, whereas the wawalen have merely, as it were, given their bodies to be dwelling-places of the deity. In the wawalen an unconscious, in the Padandas a conscious, unity with the deity has commenced. In the great temples, therefore, the mangku and wawalen are of little consideration; all ceremonies at the feasts are regulated by the directions given from the books by the Padandas, and the latter mostly use for this purpose mantras which are unknown to the mangku. Moreover, the Pandita alone (and not the wawalen) is able to call down the gods by mumbling the Vedas. The sayings of the wawalens, when, at the offerings in the temples, they give utterance to the voice of the god which dwells in them, are compared with the statements of the sacred writings of the Padandas, after which a decision is arrived at as to what must be done in important cases (sickness, wars, &c.). Thus, in these cases also, the Padandas have an opportunity of exercising their power; in the first place, they can counteract, by quotations from their sacred works, the utterances of the wawalens, if they do not meet their views; in the second place, they can easily make known to the wawalens, whom we are disposed to regard as deliberate impostors, what they must say, and, by their approval, elevate these utterances into laws for the guidance of the people.\n\nArch\u00ee (Sanskrit arch\u00ee, an image) is an idol, usually of stone, in Bali always of rude workmanship. Sometimes it is supposed that\nthe deity passes into such an image, and this fact then induces the faithful to bring their offerings. (See \"Us. Bali,\" p. 274.) This belief, however, is for the most part held only by the common people. The priests, and also a large portion of the people, attach little value to the images. \"Does not the deity dwell in heaven?\" was an idea expressed by a common man in Boeleng.\n\nThe idols, as we have already said, are called togog or tongkok, which means neither more nor less than \"doll.\" We find them principally as watchers, in the form of R\u0101ksasas and B\u016btas; for the same purpose there are also small watch-houses, called Tugu, before the temples, in order to prevent the evil spirits from entering. We also find images, such as those of Gane\u015ba and Vi\u015buki, and also of Hanum\u0101n and Garu\u1e0da, in some of the small temple-houses, representing as it were the retinue of \u015aiva. Garu\u1e0da is always monstrous, with R\u0101ksa\u015ba tusks. The Nandi is very well known to the Balinese, but I do not remember to have seen representations of it. The worship of images therefore has, upon the whole, penetrated but little into the belief of the Balinese, and we have here an obvious contrast to the creed now existing in India, where the highest value is attached to idols. I have not yet seen any representations in stone of \u015aiva, although I have met with some rude images of Vish\u1e47u (the subordinate incarnate deity). In pictures we also see \u015aiva as \u012a\u015bvara and Mah\u0101deva (when he appears as a youth), and as Arjuna, but these pictures are not worshipped, and, like those of Vish\u1e47u, as R\u0101ma, &c., have reference rather to the myths in the Kavi works, than to religion.\n\nThe offerings are called banten, charu, or aturan. Religious fasting, which the priests and those who desire to become Rishi practise daily, is called mavinten. The cap of the Pandita, jat\u0101, is also called bawa. The flowers which he uses in his domestic worship are chempaka putih, chempaka kuning (Sanskrit champaka; the a is here also altered by the nasal pronunciation into a short e), Jepon, Kenyeri, Ergani, Jenpiring, &c.\n\nThe vilva fruit and the \u015balagr\u0101ma stone, which play so important a part in the Indian worship, I have not yet met with in Bali.\n\nThe lotus has really no worship, but it is found planted in pots in the Padandas' houses, and also in the ponds which the princes are accustomed to have in their palaces.\n\nThe Brahman-band (upav\u012bta) belongs in India to the three upper castes, which are called on this account dvija, \"born twice\" (the second time through adopting this band). In that country it is of different kinds, according to three different castes. In Bali it is found only among the Padandas, and then only if they are in full dress. But the Kshatriyas and Ve\u015byas, and even \u015a\u016bdras, who have obtained permission from the Padandas, also wear a protective band, a sort of amulet, in war, called by the\nsame name (Sampat); they only wear it, however, in time of war. In Badong I have never met with it. Chandra or wulan tumanggal (the waxing moon) is in the head-dress of Ganesa, as in the Javanese images of that god. The skull (munda) above the chandra is not known to the Balinese! They have a milder form of religion, with which skulls and chains of skulls (found with the Indian Siva and Ganesa, and also in Java) are incompatible. Siva's name, Kapalabhr\u012bt, \"he who wears a skull,\" seems to be no longer clearly understood in Bali. The mark on the forehead found in some gods (e.g., Ganesa)\u2014not to be confounded with the third eye of Siva and Indra\u2014is called chumundung; it is also marked on the foreheads of the princes when they adorn themselves for a religious service; its meaning is unknown.\n\nThe King Siva-Buddha is named in the Rangga Lawe as ruler of Tumapel. His kingdom was overthrown by the people of Daha (Kediri). This King's name cannot well be anything else but an indication of the state of the religion. At that time Buddhism and Sivaism must have been completely blended together. The fall of the kingdom, then, appears to represent a reaction, brought about by the Sivaites; and it is the more remarkable that this kingdom, with a mixed religion, was conquered by that of Kediri, where the flower of the Sivaitic priests and learned men were to be found under Ayer Langgia and Jayabaya, although the latter (Jayabaya) especially also tolerated the Buddhists (see under the article Literature). From Kediri also the orthodox Sivaitic Brahmans in Bali trace their descent. We have already drawn attention in various places to the intermixture of Sivaism and Buddhism. We will give here a few facts bearing on this point. We found an image of Buddha in a temple of Siva in Boleleng; on the jat\u00e1 of the Padandus there is a ball under the linga; and, further, inverted pots or glasses are found on the small temple-houses; in the \"Usana Bali\" we have among the gods, and also in Jayabaya's retinue (in the Barata-Yuddha), the Risi Seva Sugata (Saiva belonging to Siva, and Saugata to Sugata or Buddha), Risis (holy beings partly in heaven, partly on earth) of the worship of Siva and of Buddha; in the \"Usana Java\" we have Siva, Buddha, and Bujangga as sons of sang Haji (the original one).\n\nThe Buddhists, the Balinese assert, came later than the Sivaites, and if this refers to their arrival in Java, it agrees with the accounts given in Java, where the Buddhists are also said to have come later than the Brahmans. What has happened in Java is very often confounded, even by the priests, with occurrences in Bali. These nations are particularly weak in chronology and geography. In Raffles, Appendix K, p. cxxxix, there is an account of Bali by a Muhammedan: it states: \"The religion of Buddha (under which he evidently includes the entire\nHindu religion) is divided into Sakil\u00e1n and Niskil\u00e1n. The first division will include all earthly things, and the second the religion.\" This division exists in the writings (tutur) of the Balinese, but it has no reference to religion; sakil\u00e1na that which belongs to time, and niskil\u00e1na that which belongs, not to time, but to eternity, to the period after death.\\(^1\\) The former, therefore, is correctly interpreted by the narrator, but the latter has a wider meaning.\n\nThe following are names of the ornaments of the gods:\n\n- Anting-anting, like kundala, earrings.\n- Glang Kupak, instead of alang, bracelets.\n- Guduhu pawilangan, the rosary (wilang, to count).\n- Parmata, a golden girdle (Ind. mekhala).\n- Kilat bahu, the necklace (with the Padanda atm\u00e1bhara\u1e47a).\n- Babaudong, the longest band round the neck (v\u0101yubharana).\n- Chechandian, Chandi repeated (the glung chandi).\n\nThe chakra is also to be found in the place of the genitri (guduha genitri), a substitution which in some cases can easily occur with the Javanese images as well.\n\nThe temples in Bali are of the same class as those of Majapahit, or of the third period: in Crawfurd, \"Ind. Arch.,\" vol. ii. p. 205, \"temples constructed of brick mortar.\" The bricks of which they are built are not of first-rate manufacture, and consequently not very durable. Stone carvings, which are plentiful in the ruins of Majapahit, are only to be found rarely in a few ancient temples and palaces (the best in Mengwi; and in Klungkung and Gyanjar). This art has evidently not advanced in Bali, and there are now very few men who can work in stone, and even these no longer produce anything of beauty. The art of carving wood, ivory, and whalebone has been tolerably well preserved; neat images of gods and R\u0101ksasas are carved out of the last material.\n\nCrawfurd and Raffles maintain that the religion of the people in Bali cannot be called Hindu; but, from all my inquiries into the worship of the common people, which at first I was inclined to regard as a remnant of the purely Polynesian age, I have convinced myself that this also is Hindu, and that the low estimation in which the temples of the S\u016bdras are held by the priests has merely obscured the objects and corrupted the mode of this worship. These small temples are regarded as pungrawas (substitutes) for the large and principal ones, just as the S\u016bdras who pray in them are vassals of the men of rank who pray in the great temples.\n\nAnother difference finds expression in the saying, that not only in such temples, but also in the small sanggars of the upper\n\n\\(^{1}\\) [R. van Eck in \"Tijdschrift voor Nederlandsch Indi\u00eb,\" 1879, i. p. 57.]\nclasses, \"\u015aiva's children\" are worshipped. Who these children are, however, is not clear; some Balinese names\u2014e.g., sang Kasuhun Kidul (meaning he who is \"worshipped in the south\"), Brahm\u0101 or Mah\u0101deva\u2014do not afford us any explanation. It would appear that here also we must have recourse to the difference of the castes; as the insignificant temples alone belong to the \u015a\u016bdras, so they have no claim to the worship of the Supreme \u015aiva. Only the subordinate manifestations of \u015aiva, called for want of a better word, \"\u015aiva's children,\" are intended for them.\n\nBesides these children of \u015aiva, the Pitaras, the shades of the dead, are also worshipped in the small temples, and we shall show that these may be regarded as identical, as it were, with \"\u015aiva's children.\" We have already seen in connexion with Indra, that it is not easy to reconcile the decrees as to becoming a Pitara with the punishments to be imposed by Yama. According to some, all the persons who have undergone cremation dwell as pitaras in Svarga or Indraloka, and there enjoy eternal happiness; according to others, they wander about for a long time before reaching that place, and assume various forms upon earth; and finally it is also said that, although they enter Indraloka, they are obliged to descend again to the earth as human beings; it is not said when this obligation ceases, and their state in heaven is called indiscriminately deva, hyang (god), or pitara. According to the popular belief, Brahmaloka or Vish\u1e47uloka (which are identical and higher than Indraloka), and \u015aivaloka, the highest of all, are not attainable. The Brahmans, however, appear not to share this belief, and lay claim also to these supreme worlds and the moksha (deliverance from the transmigration of the soul). Among the \"children of \u015aiva\" we have also to include such ascended souls, dwelling in \u015aivaloka, although it is surprising that they have not become identical and one with \u015aiva (who here is the same as the Indian Parabrahma), as the word moksha indicates.\n\nAccording to the accounts of men of the lower castes, it is supposed that, in the worship of the Panditas, not \u015aiva himself, but Bagarv\u0101n By\u0101sa, enters into the Padanda; the latter then becomes like By\u0101sa, and possesses the divine power of the Devarshi. Upon the whole, this statement is almost identical with the opinion which we have already expressed. By\u0101sa is, as it were, the same as the deity (\u015aiva), and, as we have already seen (under Literature), is called Yog\u012b\u015bvara, a name for \u015aiva himself.\n\nInto the wawalen, to whom we have before alluded, there passes, according to the same accounts, a B\u016bta kaparagan (an embodied B\u016bta), who is said to be the confidant of the god and to know his secrets. This spirit, therefore, and not the deity itself, speaks from out of the wawalen. We may be surprised that a B\u016bta should be called here the confidant of the deity, yet the conceptions of a B\u016bta, a R\u0101ksasa, and a Deva are so mixed up\nin the minds of the lower orders, that we cannot attach much importance to this fact, and, besides this, the B\u016btas and Devas were originally as closely related to each other as K\u0101la to \u015aiva, and the Elves to the Fays.\n\nThe wawalens are also the physicians (balian = dukun);\u00b9 when they act in this capacity, they recite Mantras (mayoga), moving their bodies as the Panditas do when they mumble the Vedas. In addition to the mantras, the b\u0101yu (the wind) is the remedy employed by the balian; he causes his breath to pass into the bodies of the sick.*\n\nHe who performs tapa lives only on the viyu, without any other food. In the \u201cUsana Bali,\u201d however, we have seen that tapa (penance) is now no longer performed in Bali.\n\nRISHIS.\n\nReligious rites analogous to the domestic worship of the Padandas are performed also by certain princes and other Devas and Gustis, in order to attain the dignity of a Risi. These persons also perform a service every morning on a fasting stomach, using, however, not the Vedas, but the Mantras, namely the Mantra pasuchian (the purifying Mantra). They perform ablutions with holy water, wash out their mouths, purify their teeth, and wash their hair; not until they have done this do they dress and appear in public. When, by means of this daily service, which must be coupled with a very regular mode of life (they may not lie, nor say or do anything degrading, &c.), they have attained a certain holiness, they become Risis. This state of Risi has much in accordance with the third period of the lifetime of the Indians according to Manu, where they live for meditation alone, and, withdrawn from all earthly affairs, pass a peaceful life, pleasing to God, in the forest hermitages. In Bali, also, a prince who has become a Risi must relinquish his kingdom to his children, and, intent alone upon his heavenly state, separate himself from all human companionship. It seems, however, that at present love for earthly things is of more weight than care about heaven. The last prince but one of Pam'chuttan in Badong, Ngurah G'de Pam'chuttan had become a Risi, yet he retained his kingdom until his death. The old R\u0101ja Kassiman has performed the said service (which is incorrectly called also maveda or masuryasevana) for a series of years, and yet he has not become a Risi, and seems to keep that dignity in reserve, in case the princes of Pam'chuttan and Den\n\n\u00b9 [The Javanese dukun applies to both sexes, the Dayak balian to females only. See Hardeland's \"Grammatik,\" p. 209.]\n\n* In the body are b\u0101yu, wind; \u015babda, sound; and id\u0101p, understanding, the faculty of learning, the three properties which the tr\u012b\u015bakti (or trim\u016brti) form out of it.\nPassar will no longer acknowledge him as their guardian. The wife of a Risi can alone follow him into the state of separation, provided that she, too, has performed the daily service, and, like him, has remained free from all misdeeds and sins.\n\nThis service makes the Brahman (Ida) a Padanda (where, however, other regulations also come in), and the kshatriya and Wesya a Risi (R\u0101jarshi, royal Risi, to be distinguished from the Devarshis, divine Risis, and the Brahmarshis, the Brahmanical Risis). A \u015a\u016bdra, finally, becomes through this service a Dukuh.\n\n**Trim\u016brti.**\n\nThe Trim\u016brti or Tri\u015bakti (trinity) is contained in the word om (really Indian om), which is formed of three letters, a, \u0101, m, or, as the Balinese say, of ang, \u016bng, mang, meaning Sad\u0101-\u015aiva, Parama-\u015aiva, and Mah\u0101\u015biva; or Brahm\u0101, Vish\u1e47u, and \u015aiva, also represented as agni (fire), toya (water), and angin (air). In this combination \u015aiva is co-ordinated with Brahm\u0101 and Vish\u1e47u, but he is called Mah\u0101\u015biva, the great \u015aiva, and the other two gods bear his name, and must be regarded, as it were, as expressions of himself. \u015aiva, also, is represented hereby as being in the centre, with Brahm\u0101 on his right hand and Vish\u1e47u on his left.\n\nThis trinity (also called tri\u015bakti) repeats itself throughout Nature. We have the tribhuvana (the three worlds), consisting of bh\u016br, bhuvah, and svah (earth, air, and space). And further, langit, prithivi, and naraka (heaven, earth, and hell). Three kinds of human beings: parampuwan, laki, and banji (woman, man, and hermaphrodite). The last kind also appears in \u015aiva as Arddhanare\u015bvara (\u015aiva with his wife in one body).\n\nIn the month of Kasanga, in which the lunar year of months begins, all the Balinese keep the feast of Mataivur or Labu guntu; Kasanga is also called by its Indian name, Chetra, and, as in India, begins the year.\n\n**Cremations.**\n\nOne of the most important religious ceremonies is the cremation of the dead. Only through the burning of the body is it possible for the soul to enter the heaven of Indra (Svarga), and, thence, that of Vish\u1e47u and the supreme heaven of \u015aiva (Vish\u1e47uloka and \u015aivaloka). The doctrine of the transmigration of the soul exists in Bali, although the Balinese do not speak of its details; the \u0101tmapra\u015bans\u0101 is a work on this subject (explained as kumpulan badan, the assumption of various bodies; according to the Indian words it seems to be \u201cglorification of the soul,\u201d a point which its contents leave in uncertainty). This work, however, is a popular one, written in Kidung, but it does not appear\nto contain the whole of the purely Indian doctrine of the transmigration of souls. Other writings of the Brahmans exist on this subject, but they are secret; it is according to these that the ceremonial at cremations is regulated.\n\nIt is believed that cremation, and the offerings which precede and follow it, exempt a man from any further change of shape\u2014at least he remains for a certain time as a piti in the heaven of the Devas, and as such demands the worship and offerings of his surviving relations. Cremation requires a considerable outlay, and therefore every family is not in a position to show this honour to its dead. Instead of being burned, they are in that case buried, the body being inclosed in a case of bamboo, which completely conceals it, and covered with a number of clothes; it is carried out upon a bier amid the singing of naenia, which, among the common people, are trivial compositions. Arrived at the grave, the body is stripped of its clothes, and let down with the bamboo covering; a few small coins are then thrown into the grave (in order that the dead may provide himself with food), and it is closed. By the side of the grave a bamboo is fixed in the ground, on the top of which there is a sort of three-cornered hutch of lattice-work, in which offerings of small value, chiefly rice and flowers and fruit, are deposited immediately after the funeral, and subsequently at certain intervals. These offerings are for the purpose of propitiating the Butas (the demoniacal beings who infest places of burial especially), lest they should attack the soul of the deceased. The grave is then surrounded with a fence or hedge.\n\nThose who are buried in this way cannot enter heaven; they then assume all sorts of shapes, and it seems that the Balinese especially believe that the numerous dogs which wander about half wild are metamorphoses of Sudras (the lowest caste); for this reason they hardly ever kill a dog, and these ugly animals increase and multiply enormously, and are a pest to the European. It is now the duty of a member of the family (son, grandson, &c., sometimes even the third generation, if he has become rich enough to afford a cremation) to cause the bones of all his relations who have been buried to be exhumed and to burn them together. At most cremations, therefore, one sees a number of bodies at once, each in a special coffin, many of which have usually been buried for years. In times of general calamity, contagious diseases, &c., all bodies, even those of princes, are buried and not burned; it is not permitted then to keep any corpse above ground, for in such times no work pleasing to the gods can be undertaken, and the influence of the demons is in the ascendant. At these times, also, the Galungan is not celebrated.\n\n1 [According to Jacobs, l. l. p. 49, from 800 to 1,500 florins, in the case of princes 10,000 florins.]\nThe long periods that corpses are kept is also noteworthy, although I have discovered that Crawfurd's statements (\"As. Researches,\" vol. xiii. p. 136; \"Ind. Arch.,\" vol. ii. p. 253) as to the length of time are inaccurate. The duration of the impurity of a house in which a dead body has lain is more precisely fixed, being more than a month for a S\u016bdra, only eight days for a Brahman, and an intermediate time for the second and third castes. The time during which corpses are kept varies very much, and the day of the cremation does not at all depend upon the date of the death.\n\nThere are bodies in Badong which have been kept twenty years; on the other hand, the body of the prince of Gyanyar was burned about forty days after his death. But the statement (Crawf., \"Hist. Ind. Arch.,\" p. 244) that a month and a week is the time that bodies must be kept for cremation is also inaccurate, for this reason, that it is not every day that is suited for a cremation; it must be a lucky day, and in order to obtain such a day all good omens must concur; it must also be in the first half of the lunar month (with a waxing moon), and thus can hardly ever happen at one and the same interval of time after the date of the death.\n\nA series of ceremonies belong to cremation. Immediately after death the body is embalmed by the relatives, and in the case of a prince, also by the junior r\u016bjas of the friendly States; for this purpose spices are used, with which the body is entirely covered, and these again are covered on the principal parts of the body with small coins\u2014over these come clothes, mats, and a covering of split bamboo. This sort of embalming\\(^1\\) does not protect the body from partial decomposition; the emanations\\(^2\\) from it are collected in a vessel underneath the Bale\\(^3\\) on which the body lies, and are poured away every day. If the body remains so long unburnt, it becomes dried up in about six months. It is watched the whole time, and if emanations still run from it, they are caught in the vessel referred to; offerings and holy water are also presented. In its mouth the corpse has a gold ring, set with a ruby; this protects it from the power of the demons, and it is the most heinous sin to steal such a ring (a thing, however, which happened not long since). Three days before the cremation the corpse is stripped of its coverings, and the relatives look upon the dead for the last time. Meanwhile, the spices have penetrated into the body; the latter is then washed and again enveloped in split bamboo, mats, and clothes. Instead of a ruby, five small metal plates inscribed with the word ong, and with mystic formulas, are\n\n\\(^1\\) [Called ngk\u014dl\u014dt in the high dialect, corresponding to the Javanese Ngoko, and nggulung in the low or Krama form.]\n\n\\(^2\\) [Called bany\u0113h, and in the case of a Brahman corpse, pring\u0113t.]\n\n\\(^3\\) [The Bale, or more correctly bale pandung, is a bier or kind of tent, often of considerable dimensions, for the reception of the body until its cremation.]\nput into the mouth; the five plates signify the five principal gods (\u015aiva, Brahmad, Vishnu, Indra, and Yama?), comprised in the words Sa, ba, ta, ha, i (Sa = \u015aiva, Ba = Brahmad, I = Indra; ta and ha are not clear to me, but ha seems to indicate Hari, one of the principal names of Vishnu);* the plates are of gold, silver, copper, iron, and lead. These plates, which keep the body, as it were, under the protection of those five gods, are taken away immediately before cremation, when this protection appears to be rendered unnecessary by the reading of the Vedas and the pouring out of holy water. Houses in which dead bodies are kept are unclean, and, in the case of princes, the palace is not occupied by the successor until after the cremation, and is merely guarded by the people belonging to the deceased. This is occurring, at the present moment, in Den Passar (one of the three residences of princes in Badung), where the bodies of five illustrious princes are kept in the great palace, and the reigning prince lives for the present in a small house of little pretension. The first ceremony mentioned above, that of washing before cremation, is called pang\u0101skaran or pabrisssian (purification); \u0101\u015bkara seems to be Sanskrit, but it is not found in Wilson (first edition).1\n\nThe preparations for cremation take much time and much money. A bridge is built on each side of the wall of the palace for the conveyance of the body to the Bade.2 The Bade, or funeral pyre, is, in the case of princes, very gorgeous. It rests on a basis of bamboo, concealed by handsome hangings, under which the bearers place themselves, to move the structure along. On this foundation there is a pyramid of woodwork or bamboo, in from three to eleven storeys. I have only seen the latter number at the cremation of Dewa Mangis in Gjanyar, and this agrees with the number of storeys in the Merus of the temples; it certainly has a religious meaning, reminding us of the Buddhist pyramidal buildings and of the philosophical ideas connected therewith. This pyramid is ornamented with more or less splendour, according to the means of the relations of the deceased; the covering is made of little balls of cotton, fastened on to the wooden framework in fringes, and forming heads of elephants and B\u016btas round the bottom and at the corners of the different storeys. These balls are of all the colours mentioned in the \u201cUsana Bali\u201d: white,\n\n---\n\n* According to Wilson, Tha is \u015aiva; \u1e36, K\u0101ma; \u1e36a, \u015aiva and Vishnu. See also \u201cUsana Bali,\u201d p. 328. These letters are called Panch\u0101kshara, the five (sacred) letters.\n\n1 [\u0100\u015bkara is a mutilated form of the Sanskrit sansk\u0101ra\u2014i.e., the ceremony kar\u2019\u0113x\u014dx\u012bp. See v. d. Tunk in \u201cBijdragen,\u201d III. vol. v. p. 212. Pambresihan, from bresih, \u201cpure,\u201d = b\u0113s\u012bh in Malay and Javanese.]\n\n2 [More correctly wadah. In Javanese and Sundanese the word means any receptacle. Jacobs, l. l. p. 227 ff., gives a full account of two of those gorgeous structures he saw at Tabanan.]\nred, dark blue, and yellow. The whole of the lower portion, as well as the corner of the pyramid, is covered in this way. The outer sides of the different storeys are ornamented with tinsel and red, and inside they are fitted up as rooms with mirrors and furniture. Persons are stationed on each storey to attend to the regular progress of the machine and to keep the little rooms clean. The corpse is laid in the highest storey, and covered with a great number of white cloths, which hang down the sides of the pyramid.\n\nSpecial places are made ready for the cremation of distinguished persons. In Gyanvar a square of about 400 paces in length and breadth, surrounded by a wall of pillars of masonry with trellis-work between them, was prepared above the palace, on the summit of the hill up which the dessa extends. In the centre there was a Bale of masonry inlaid with a sort of mosaic of glass-work and boards, after the manner of the Bales used for offerings in the temples. The Bale consisted of two storeys, and was surrounded with trellis-work. Above it rose, on four pillars, another chamber and a roof, the chamber ornamented with mirrors, and the whole covered with tinsel. The pillars were covered in red. This place was intended for the cremation, and upon it stood a figure of a lion (singha). This figure is only used at the cremation of reigning princes (chokorda);* other distinguished persons are burnt in the figure of a cow\u2014men in that of a black, and women in that of a white lembu. The common man, generally, has only a simple square wooden coffin to be burnt in, but figures are sometimes used also by the lower orders\u2014e.g., Gajamina, a monster, half elephant, half fish. These figures of beasts are ornamented to a certain extent (in Gyanvar very splendidly); the erect tail and the back are taken off, like a lid, when the body is let down into the figure, and are replaced after the ceremony of letting down the body. In Gyanvar, outside the square, in the centre and at the sides, there were several large and ornamental Bales for the distinguished spectators, and especially for the very numerous women. In addition to these, there were the places for the cremation of the three Belas, on the left. For several days before the cremation of people of rank, one or more Panditas reside with the relatives; they manage all that has to be done, indicate the mode of making the offerings, prepare the metal plates, and invoke, by means of the Vedas, the success of the important ceremony about to be undertaken. It is they also who conduct the Bade to the place of cremation. If the deceased belongs to the second caste, the Kshatriyas, the Bade is fastened to a serpent (n\u0101ga or n\u0101gabandha, serpent-band); this serpent is\n\n* It has been said, however, that this custom did not come from India. [Chokorda in Balinese\u2014p\u0101duka.]\nornamented in the same manner as the foot-piece of the Bade, and has wings; the body is quite thirty fathoms long, and is carried by men. Before the procession starts, the Padanda descends from his palanquin and shoots from the four cardinal points at the head of the serpent, whose evil influence is thereby destroyed. He uses for this purpose wooden arrows with white flowers attached to their ends, the flowers alone being discharged at the serpent.* This peculiar custom of fastening a serpent in front of the Bade, and of the killing of this reptile by a Pandita, points to a fable of former quarrels between the earthly gods (the Brahmans) and the princes. A Deva agung was in the habit of ridiculing the Brahmans; he especially threw doubts upon their supernatural power. Once upon a time, when a powerful Pandita was at his palace, he caused a goose to be put into a well or pit, and the latter to be closed. He then asked the Pandita what animal was in the well, and the Pandita replied, a n\u0101ga. Thereupon the prince wished to ridicule him, but when he opened the well, a terrible serpent came indeed forth. The king then, astounded and terrified, was rescued in his need by the good Pandita, who slew the serpent, and ever since that time, at the cremation of all Kshatriyas, a serpent has been fastened to the Bade, killed by the Pandita, and burnt with the corpse. When this serpent has been figuratively slain, it is wound round the Padanda\u2019s seat, the tail remaining fastened to the Bade; in this manner the Padanda conducts the corpse (or, in reality, according to their notions, the soul) to the place of cremation, and so to heaven (svarga), where it (the soul) is admitted among the pilaras.\n\nThe procession at cremations is very long, even with the lower orders. In Gyanyar, where the princes and many armed men, besides the bands of musicians and actors from all States of Bali (excepting Bangli), were present at the celebration of the feast, the procession extended for upwards of a \u201cpaal.\u201d First came always the coolies bearing the wood for the cremation. In Gyanyar, they carried pieces of wood of uniform shape, coloured black and gold. It is said to be customary to use sandal-wood for princes; but this did not appear to me to be the case, for the pieces were too large, and would have been too costly for the means of a small Balinese prince. Then came the music and the men armed with muskets, then all the articles of personal use belonging to the deceased, and then holy water and offerings for the B\u016btas, carried by women on their heads. The order of march is: twenty or thirty men armed with lances, and then the bearers of the Upach\u0101ra, walking two and two (upach\u0101ra means in Sanskrit service and also present; to be understood here as the articles\n\n* This is almost the only case in which a bow and arrow are used in Bali; with this exception, we only meet with their use in some dramatic representations, where they appear in accordance with the Indian myths.\nbelonging to the service of the deceased.* These include everything of domestic use in Bali: clothes, rings, and other jewellery, mirrors, and articles of the toilet, the sirih-box (in the case of princes, of gold), the water-bottle (also of a precious metal), the umbrella (payung; umbrellas are also held over the jewellery by those walking nearest); and, finally, the horse of the deceased, richly caparisoned, led in the procession by men, and sometimes ridden by a young son or grandson of the deceased. All these are again followed by armed men and musicians; the bands of music separate the divisions of the procession. The second part is devoted entirely to holy water (toya tirta);\u2020 more than a hundred women carry small vessels of water on their heads; this water comes from the most sacred places in Bali, and is solicited and bought from the Padandas who stand in especially high esteem. Here, again, the intermixture of Buddhism is noteworthy; we have here not only holy water from the Padanda of \u015aiva, but also from the Buddhist Padanda, and these waters are mixed together.\u2021 It appears, therefore, that the Sivaites also require the help of Buddha, and that Buddhism is still, as it were, an integral part of the religion of all Balinese. This water is called toya or toya tirta, \u201cwater of a holy place;\u201d tirtha is Ind. \u201ca holy bathing-place,\u201d and also \u201ca chapel;\u201d our holy water comes from both such places, from the sacred waters (see toya Sindu in \u201cUs. Bali,\u201d p. 337), from the temples, and from the houses of the Padandas, who have consecrated it by mumbling the Vedas.\n\nThe offerings for the Butas, bant\u00e9n dagan, form the third division of the procession. Dagan is the Balinese name for B\u00fata, although the latter word is used quite as often. These offerings consist of all sorts of meats, cooked and half-cooked, of rice, fruits, flowers, leaves; all these vegetable offerings must be of five different colours: white (the colour of \u015aiva or Mah\u0101deva), red (Brahm\u0101), yellow (Buddha and also \u015aiva in Bali,\u00a7 black or dark blue (Vish\u1e47u; also K\u0101la), and brumbu, a mixture of the four colours; the last is the colour of the supreme \u015aiva, who combines in himself the natures of the four already named. These offerings are made to propitiate the B\u00fatas, who are supposed to haunt the burial-grounds. The offerings for the gods and pitaras (the shades), which are offered the same day, are left at home.\n\n* According to Gericke\u2019s Javanese Dictionary, which has reached me too late, hupachara means tokens of distinction and of honour, state-decorations, insignia, ceremony, pomp, splendour. This agrees with our explanation.\n\u2020 This water is as holy as that of the Ganges.\n\u2021 The mixed holy water is called toya pangintas, and is especially purifying and a protection from danger; leaves of gold (mas tripi) and a costly gold ring (which the Pandita keeps) with a ruby are placed in it; and also flowers, balung-balung, or ground sandal-wood; powdered rubies; whole rice (bij\u0101); cut flowers and leaves (samsam).\n\u00a7 Comp. Pit\u0101mbara, \u201cwith a yellow garment.\u201d\nHere usually follows the Padanda, carried in a palanquin, and drawing after him, when a Kshatriya is burnt, the dead n\u0101ga with the Bade attached to it. At several points, especially at the corners of the road, before the house of the deceased, and before the place of cremation, the Bade is turned three times, the Padanda being carried before it and leading the movement. The lofty structure of the Bade sometimes renders it necessary to employ more than 400 men to perform these manoeuvres. In Gyanyar the prince, the son of the deceased, preceded the Bade, followed by a great number of other princes and the armed men of Gyanyar and Badong. In other cases I have always seen the relatives following the deceased; the reason why the prince preceded the corpse was this, that the Belas with their procession followed the Bade, and that the princes considered it beneath their dignity to go behind the Belas, who in this case were all Gundiks (concubines from the fourth caste). During the whole march Kavi-songs are sung, chiefly by those who carry the Bade; they were not songs of mourning, however, but favourite portions of the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a, B\u0101rata Yuddha, and other works well known to the people.\n\nWhen the procession has arrived at the place of cremation, and the Bade has turned round thrice for the last time, the body is carried down from the top of the Bade by a staircase made for this purpose, and up by another small staircase to the place of burning, where it is laid in the coffin (the lion or cow). The corpse is then only in the covering of bamboo referred to above; the clothes and ornaments remain on the Bade, and some of them are taken home again, the remainder, as well as all the ornaments of the Bade, being given up to the people as plunder after the cremation. The Pandita then, mumbling the Vedas, sprinkles on the body the different kinds of holy water\u2014a ceremony which generally lasts more than an hour. At last, after all the vessels of holy water have been emptied, the Padanda quits the spot, and the bearers of wood now kindle a fire under the figure of the animal, which is consumed but slowly, on account of the copious wetting which it has received. Sand is strewn on the foundation of wood or masonry, to prevent the fire from spreading. When the corpse is consumed, the bones are collected by the watchers, laid on the purified place of burning, and covered with clothes, to which are added also the utensils for adornment and small offerings. These are carried the next day with great state to the sea and thrown into it, together with money and offerings. Before this is done the Padanda again reads the Vedas on a lofty erection, making frequent use of the bells, which stand by his side. Opposite the Padanda stand rich offerings of all kinds, and especially quantities of clothes and money. The Padanda receives these offerings. He is also offered a tolerably large sum,\nup to \u00a350, for performing the ceremonies, but most priests take only part of this and return the rest to the relatives of the deceased. Other ceremonies follow at intervals of a fortnight, of some months, and of a year after the cremation. At these we have again a procession, as at the cremation itself; there is a Bade, upon which the corpse is represented by flowers; these flowers (puspa) are also thrown into the sea. During the whole of this time numerous offerings are made for the deceased. After the ceremony, which takes place a year after the cremation, the deceased is regarded as actually admitted among the pitaras (the shades) in Indra's heaven, and as sharing in the offerings which are presented to the latter in the domestic temples. Great princes sometimes celebrate a feast to the memory of the dead even after the lapse of some years.\n\nThe burning of widows has attracted most attention from Europeans. Wonder is expressed at the great number of women sacrificed in this way in Bali in former times (Crawfurd, \"As. Res.\" vol. xiii. p. 135); yet it should be borne in mind that in Bali polygamy is carried further than in any other country\u2014that, e.g., the great-grandfather of r\u0101ja Kassiman, prince of Nguruh Sakti Pamchutan, had 500 wives\u2014and thus it cannot surprise us to see so many women burnt, particularly since the women who offer themselves gain the highest distinction, and the sacred writings, from the Parvas (divisions of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata) downwards, represent this act as praiseworthy and almost necessary. That in India but one wife follows her husband in death, is naturally explained by the fact that very few Hindus have more than one wife. But little is yet known of the burning of widows among the princes of India, and as but few independent princes now exist who are worshippers of \u015aiva, the silence on this subject is easily accounted for.*\n\nIn Bali the burning of widows is confined almost entirely to the princely families. The princes are now either Kshatriyas or Ve\u015byas (Devas or Gustis), and so far Crawfurd is correct in saying that only the second and third castes observe this custom. The true reason of this, however, lies in the outlay which is requisite. The \u015a\u016bdras are seldom rich enough to bear the expense of a splendid cremation; their women, also, are less under the influence of the priests, who do not trouble themselves much about such common people; and finally, the wife's respect for the deceased husband is not so great, because he was of the same rank as herself. Among\n\n---\n\n1 [Greater details concerning cremation are given by R. van Eck in \"Tijdschrift voor Nederlandsch Indi\u00eb,\" 1879, vol. i. pp. 104-24. See also Jacobs, l. l. pp. 49-53.]\n\n* A man of high rank in Nipal, Bhugtee Thapa, was followed into the fire by his two wives.\u2014H. T. Prinsep, Transactions of the Marquess of Hastings, vol. i. p. 170, note.\nthe Brahmans the burning of widows is still rarer, but yet a case which occurred some years ago in Badong has come to my knowledge. The Brahmans do not regard it as necessary; it is not prescribed in the Vedas, nor is it practised in India by the Brahmans, who have remained free from the worship of the sect.\n\nThe names given to the burning of widows are known from Crawfurd: Satya and Bela. This explanation of them must be modified. Satya is the burning of a wife, who from a platform erected for the purpose, throws herself into the same fire with her husband, committing suicide with the creese at the same time. These may be either lawful wives or concubines, and the latter is not unfrequently the case. Bela, on the contrary, is the burning of a wife, who is burnt in a separate fire, not with her husband, jumping into it alive, without using the creese. This latter method is not thought so much of, but is the more common. These women, who are also called improperly Belas, are mostly concubines, but I have also been told of cases in which lawful wives have chosen this method of self-immolation.\n\nThe names Satya and Bela are Indian\u2014the former unmistakeably, the second in all probability. Satya is truth, fidelity; the wife who dies in this way is called Satyavati, a true, faithful woman, who has performed in all things her duty to her husband. Bela is explained by Crawfurd as \"retaliation,\" but so far as I am able to reconcile the Balinese explanations with each other, it is rather the Sanskrit wel\u00e1 \"sudden and easy death\" (Wilson).\u00b9\n\nThis is rendered clear by the way in which it takes place; and further by the fact that the sacrifice of the followers of a prince defeated in war, who then die together in an amok, is also called Bela. In general it means in Bali \"dying with the man of higher rank\" (the wife with her husband, the slave with his master, the followers with the prince).\n\nThat female slaves were murdered by men appointed for the purpose, and were afterwards cast into the fire, which would seem to be a compulsory human sacrifice, must have been a fact 200 years ago, and was observed by Mr. Zollinger in Lombok,* but I have not found any trace of it in Bali. The women who sacrifice themselves are indeed, as a rule, slaves, for they are mostly from the fourth caste (the S\u0101dras), at least all the concubines are; but\n\n\u00b9 [The meaning given in R. von Eck's \"Balieneesch Woordenboek\" is \"faithful unto death.\" In Javanese, the word conveys the meaning \"to die or suffer with or for another.\" See the numerous examples in Vreede's edition of Roorda's Dictionary, p. 1093. For other explanations of the terms satya and wel\u00e1, see Wilken, \"Het Animisme,\" p. 85. Satya is evidently an abbreviation of Satyavati.]\n\n* See the report of the Dutch envoys to Gelgel, in Crawfurd, \"Ind. Arch.\" vol. ii. p. 244 sqq.\ntheir immolation is voluntary,\u00b9 and neither in the Satya or the Bela are they touched by a man. From the moment that they declare themselves ready to be burnt alive, they are holy persons; they enjoy all the honours of the Pitaras. They may no longer tread the ground, but must always be carried. Offerings are even made to them, and all their wishes are satisfied. Nevertheless, the successor of the deceased simply regards such concubines as the servants who will be required by his father after his cremation. The women themselves are excited by religious ideas; a female priest always accompanies them till the moment of death, and describes to them in glowing colours the happiness of life in Svarga, the rise to a higher caste, and how they will thereby become the lawful wives of the deceased. To these deceptions must be added the honour and the advantages which the woman's relations expect to receive from the prince's successor; the men of her family have a claim to offices; they are made chiefs of Dessas, Pamb'kilis, &c. They are therefore the only persons who sometimes use means of compulsion to prevent the women from retracting. They accompany the victim of the family; they keep up the fire, and, if the woman hesitates, tip up the plank on which she stands above the fire, so that she falls in against her will. These cases, however, are of rare occurrence. Deception of the imagination and the use of opium have generally made the victims quite indifferent, and they jump into the fire as if it were a bath.\n\nEight days after the death of a prince or noble his wives are asked whether any of them wish to follow him into the fire; those who then state their willingness are accepted, and, during the interval before the cremation, are shown the above honours. They cannot easily change their minds; the opposition of their relatives, and the shame which would attach to them, as well as\n\n\u00b9 [In reference to this we quote an appropriate passage from the work of Dr. Julius Jacobs (\"Eenigen tijd onder de Baliers,\" Batavia, 1883, p. 230), whose account of the inhabitants is at the same time the most recent and the least biased: \"It is perhaps too much to say that a wife does not follow her husband to the funeral pyre of her own free will. There are actually women who, to all appearance, voluntarily throw themselves into the fire, or, in the case of the husband having fallen in battle, stab themselves on his corpse (bela). A mother may also follow her child to death; a betrothed, her lover; a child, its mother; nay, even a friend his friend. Supposing that there exist, to some extent, a genuine sorrow, a holy attachment for the beloved one, it is also in a great measure a fact that those who sacrifice themselves are heartily convinced that in requital of that noble deed they are immediately after death received into the Satyaloka, where they are made partakers of unutterable joys, so that thereby at once their sins are wiped out and they attain to eternal bliss. Add to this the influence of the priests who here, as elsewhere, are powerful agents with women, and try to induce them to self-sacrifice by holding out to them all sorts of promises, and who bring them by dint of fasting, prayers, and stupefying drinks, to a state of mental imbecility that makes them no longer accountable for their actions, and you will know what is meant by their sacrificing themselves of their own free will.\"]\nthe deceptions of the priests, hold them back. The women who may wish to give in their names after this period of eight days are not accepted, perhaps in order to avoid the appearance of compulsion. The women who have offered themselves to be burnt lead thenceforward a life of pleasure, and enjoy much greater honour than they ever knew before. This again is a reason why they should not change their minds during the interval, sometimes a long one, before the cremation.\n\nWe will here add some details of a cremation, at which women were burnt, in Gyanjar, of which we were eye-witnesses. On the 20th December, 1847, the prince of Gyanjar, Dewa Mangis, was burnt; we have already spoken above of the way in which his body underwent cremation. The corpse was followed by the three wives (concubines), who became Belas. A procession went before them, as before the body: (1) Upach\u0101ra, (2) Tuya, (3) Banten dagan. They, like the body, were seated in the highest storeys of the Bades, which, like that of the prince, were carried by men, but had only three storeys. After the body of the prince had arrived at the place of cremation, the three Belas in their Bades\u2014each preceded by the bearers of the offerings destined for her, with armed men and bands of music\u2014were conducted to the three fires.\n\nTheir Bades were also turned round three times, and were carried round the whole place of cremation. The women were then carried down steps from the Bades, and up the steps of the places erected for their cremation. These places consisted of a square of masonry three feet high, filled with combustibles, which had been burning since the morning, and threw out a glowing heat; the persons appointed to watch them fed the fire, and at the moment when the women leaped down, poured upon it a quantity of oil and arrack, so that it flared up to a height of eight feet, and must have suffocated the victims at once. Behind this furnace stood an erection of bamboo, in the form of a bridge, of the same width as the square of masonry, and about forty feet long, and from sixteen to eighteen feet high; steps of bamboo led up to it in the rear. In the centre there is a small house, affording a last resting-place to the victim, in which she waits until the ceremonies for her husband are finished and his body has begun to burn. The side of the bamboo scaffold nearest to the fire is protected by a wall of wet Pisang-stems. Upon the bridge lies a plank smeared with oil, which is pushed out a little over the fire, as soon as the time for the leap draws near. At first there is a door at the end of the bridge, and this is not removed till the last minute. The victim sits in the house on the bridge, accompanied by a female priest and by her relatives. They all speak to her of the happiness which she will now shortly enjoy with her husband. She then makes her toilet; her hair especially is\ncombed, the mirror used, and her garments newly arranged; in short, she arrays herself exactly as she would for a feast. Her dress is white, her breasts are covered with a white slendang; she wears no ornaments, and after all the preparations to which it has been subjected, her hair at the last moment hangs quite loose. When the corpse of the prince was almost consumed, the three Belas got ready; they glanced one towards another, to convince themselves that all was prepared; but this was not a glance of fear, but of impatience, and it seemed to express a wish that they might leap at the same moment. When the door had been opened, and the plank smeared with oil and pushed out, each took her place on her plank, made three Sembahs by joining her hands above her head, and one of the bystanders placed a small clove (tiliran)\u00b9 upon her head. When the dove flies away, the soul is considered to escape. They then immediately leaped down. There was no cry in leaping, no cry from the fire; they must have been suffocated at once. One of the Europeans present succeeded in pushing through the crowd to the fire, and in seeing the body some seconds after the leap\u2014it was dead, and its movements were caused merely by the combustion of the materials cast upon the flames. On other occasions, however, Europeans have heard cries uttered in leaping, and in the first moments afterwards.\n\nDuring the whole time, from the burning of the prince till the leap of the victims, the air resounded with the clangour and noise of the numerous bands of music. The soldiers had drawn up outside the square, and contributed to the noise by firing off their muskets. Besides these, some small cannon were discharged. There was not one of the 50,000 Balinese present who did not show a merry face; no one was filled with repugnance and disgust, except a few Europeans, whose only desire was to see the end of such barbarities. The Balinese look upon this cremation simply as the consummation of their religious and domestic duties; no one sees any cruelty in it. Yet, as the all-powerful priests attach little importance to it for their own caste, with their aid the diminution and abolition of these human sacrifices among the other castes might be effected. The priests' interest in maintaining it is, alas! a monetary one\u2014and therefore no help can be expected from them.\n\nThe number of women burned in Bali itself is not considerable; in Lombok, however, where only 9000 Balinese reside (the rest are the Mahomedan Sesakers), this ceremony is more frequent.\u00b2\n\n\u00b9 [It is called Kalitiran in Malay, and a kind of sacredness attaches to it.]\n\u00b2 [A full and interesting account of the self-sacrifice of the wife of a Gusti is given by Zollinger in his article on Lombok, \"Journal of the Indian Archipelago,\" vol. v. p. 529 ff. The Journal of the Dutch Embassy to Bali (\"Bijdragen,\" II., vol. i. p. 52 ff.) gives a description of the funeral ceremonies.]\nDuring the time I spent in Bali, five or six cremations of *Gustis* took place in Lombok, and on each occasion from four to seven women offered themselves up. This preciseness in following the ancient usages also shows itself in great offerings, which cost considerable sums, but at the same time add greatly to the fame of the prince who makes them, and strengthen him for war (*e.g.*, the offerings in September 1846). The explanation of this lies in two circumstances: first, the Balinese of Lombok, and especially their prince, are much richer than those of Bali, where even the reigning princes, through the great extension of their families, possess but little means; and secondly, the Balinese of Lombok, and particularly the present prince, are looked down upon, and said to be ignorant in their religion and their customs, by the Balinese of Bali, and especially by the *Dewa agung*, whom the people of Lombok do not acknowledge. Now to refute these unfavourable opinions, they show themselves to be much more precise in the performance of their religious duties than the majority of the Balinese in Bali. During the two years of my stay in Bali, I only knew of one case of widow-burning in Gyanyar. In all the southern States also none took place; intelligence from Karang-Assem and Buleleng is uncertain and irregular, but I heard nothing of the practice in these States either. It cannot be asserted, however, that the custom has entirely disappeared. Widow-burning is considered a necessary adjunct to the cremation of a great prince, and in the last thirty years a large number of women have actually been sacrificed in Badong.\n\nNine *Belas* were burnt with the prince of *den Passar*, Ngrurah Made Pan'chuttan, Kassiman's father, and three with the last prince but one of Pan'chuttan, Ngrurah Gde Pan'chuttan (the father of the principal wives of the present Raja of Pan'chuttan). One very young wife, who threw herself *tandakking* into the flames, was burnt with the last prince of Pan'chuttan, Anak Agung Lanang (father of the present prince).*\n\nRaja Kaleran Kanginan was followed by two wives; one killed herself and became *Satyavati* (see above), after the example set by the wife of the raja Salya, one of the heroes of the *Mahabharata*, known here from the *Salyaparva*. Raja Kaleran Kawan was followed by three wives. A young wife followed raja Halit Kassiman, a nephew of the old Kassiman, who died very young. Some women also followed Kassiman's brother in Belaluan. If the dead bodies in Den Passar, which have already lain unburied\n\nat the burning of the king's mother on March 21, 1633, at which many of her female slaves were stabbed and burnt. At the funeral of the two royal princes, forty-two and thirty-four of their wives respectively threw themselves into the fire. Princesses of royal blood are not previously stabbed.]\n\n*Tandakking* on this occasion does not permit another person to *tandak* also.\nfor fifteen or twenty years, are burnt, it is doubtful whether women will follow them. The principal wives seldom follow, and in this case the deceptions cannot have the same effect upon the concubines as when they are practised upon them shortly after the death. *Rija Kassiman* prevents this burning for political reasons, as it might possibly deprive him of his prestige; another reason is the poverty of the present prince of *Deu Passar*, whose revenue has been very much diminished by *Kassiman*, and who will not for years be able to amass the sum required for such a grand cremation.\\(^1\\)\n\n**CASTES.**\n\nWe know from Crawfurd that the four Indian castes exist in Bali; we will hereafter give reasons which seem to show that caste has also existed in Java.\n\nThe names given by Crawfurd are\u2014*Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, Satriya, Wisiya, Sudra*. The names *Br\u0101hma\u1e47a* and *Sudra* are correct; *Satriya* is the corrupt pronunciation of *K\u1e63atriya*, which is found in good manuscripts (*Brahm\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dapur\u0101\u1e47a, R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a*, &c.); *Wis\u012bya* has arisen, through an oral mistake, out of *Vesiya*, as the Balinese call the third Indian caste; the Sanskrit *Vai\u015bya* cannot be rendered otherwise in Balinese; in the Balinese letters the four words correspond closely with the Sanskrit names. We have shown in the \"Usana Bali\" (l.l. p. 254) that the Balinese *taling* has a mark above the line in words where it represents the Sanskrit *\u0101i*; in the word *Wesiya*, however, the idea that this *taling* answers to an *\u0101i*, which is unpronounceable, appears to have been lost. I have never yet found the mark in the word *Wesiya* in any manuscript.\n\nThe Indian names, however, are not those in common use in Bali to indicate the difference in caste. The three upper castes have names with meanings, which are used both in speaking to and speaking of each member of the caste.\\(^2\\) These titles are:\n\n1. *Ida* for a Brahman; this is the Balinese pronoun of the second and third person in the high language. It is also used for the titles of *Deva* and *Gusti*; but when it stands alone, it always means a Brahman, who is called *He* or *Thou*. A male Brahman is called *Ida bagus*, a female Brahman, married or single, *Ida hayu*, or, contracted, *Idayu* (see below as to the word *Padanda*).\n\n2. *Deva* is the title of a *K\u1e63atriya*, both for men and women (e.g., *Deva agung putri*). *Deva* means in Sanskrit *god*, and in the language of the stage *king* (Wilson); but in the lists of names of royal houses in India which we meet with in Tod's \"Annals of Rajasthan,\" and in several inscriptions published in the \"Journal\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) [According to R. van Eck, the last widow was burnt at Klungkung in 1862 (see \"Tijdschrift voor Ned. Indi\u00eb,\" 1879, vol. i. p. 124); but this is doubtful.]\n\n\\(^2\\) [See Jacobs, l.l. p. 36. P. L. van Bloemen Waanders, l.l. p. 125.]\nof the Asiatic Society of Bengal,\" we find also the title of *deva* (or, corrupted, *dew* or *deb*) added to all the names, and we thus discover that the title of *deva* is used for all *Kshatriyas*, not only in Bali, but also in India, for every one in that caste can become king, and they are also all called *R\u0101ja* in India.\n\n3. *Gusti* is the title for the *Wesyas*, or third caste; this name is not Indian, at least not clearly. In India the third caste is not of much importance, and we are therefore not surprised that it has not a special title.\u2020 It is quite otherwise in Bali (and Java); but few *Kshatriyas* have come here from India; there were more *Wesyas*, originally merchants, agriculturists, and artificers. Since the *Kshatriyas* alone were too insignificant in number, greater honour naturally fell to the more numerous *Wesyas*. They even became kings probably in Java, and certainly in Bali, although they are always regarded as subject to the *Deva agung*, a pure *Kshatriya*. For this reason a title of honour was also given to the *Wesyas*, and this is \"Gusti.\" *Gusti* is never interpreted by the Balinese as anything but a name for a *Wesya*. In Java it is now used before the name of God, \"Gusti allah,\" and before the names of princes of royal blood; *Gusti*, used before *allah*, indicates that the word is equivalent to *tutuan* (lord). The fact, however, that the princes of Solo and Jokjokarta are called \"Gusti,\" seems to indicate that this family is also of *Wesyan* descent, and that they retained this title of honour, although the name of the caste, through Mohammedan influence, had been almost lost.\n\n4. The fourth caste, very naturally, has no title of honour. They are the born servants, and can make no claim to marks of honour. Courtesy, however, assigns to them in address the hypocritical name of \"father\" and \"mother\" (*bapa* and *meme*). In speaking of them, the term which is also applied to all foreigners (Buginese, Chinese, and Europeans) is used\u2014*kahula*, slave, dependent, or *wang* (=orang), man; they represent the *ordinary man*, while the three superior castes trace their descent from gods and demi-gods.\n\n*Mixed castes* do not exist in Bali, whereas, even in the very ancient Indian law-book of *Manu*, a large number of mixed castes are enumerated. This is to be explained by the fact that too few people of the three principal castes came over to Java and Bali,\n\n---\n\n* Goshthi is in Sanskrit \"assembly, meeting; conversation, discourse; family connexions, but especially the dependent or junior branches.\" [This derivation appears very doubtful in spite of Favre's qualifying concession; see his \"Dictionnaire Malais,\" s.v. If tenable at all, it could only come through a supposed adjective, goshthin.]\n\n\u2020 Arya, it is true, is the name for a *Wesya* in India; but what does it mean? The name Arya for the *Kshatriyas* of Java (and Bali) is to be read with a long \u0101 (\u0101rya), and then means \"one of the nation of the Aryans (an Indian, a Persian). According to Wilson: Arya, \"a master, a man of the third tribe; adj. excellent; \u0101rya, of a good family; respectable, venerable; apposite, proper; a master, an owner.\"\nand that these probably brought with them too few women, to maintain the purity of their descendants, and therefore, to prevent the extinction of the chief families, all the children remained in the caste of their father, although the mother may have been of common extraction.\n\nIn India the mixed castes arose in two ways: first, through the marriage of a man of a higher caste with a woman of a lower one; secondly, through the marriage of a woman of high caste with a man of inferior birth. The first case is not considered a disgrace to the mixed caste; the second degrades the offspring, because this union is a disgrace; and thus we have the most despised of all Indian castes\u2014the chandilas (Parias), the offspring of a marriage of a female Brahman with a S\u00fbdra. In Bali the first kind of marriage causes no mixture of caste; the children follow the caste of the father, but are inferior to the children of high-caste women, and in matters of succession and inheritance are dealt with as of lower standing, even though they be older than their more noble brothers and sisters. The second case cannot occur, for, in Bali, all marriages of high-caste women with men of lower birth (provided they are acknowledged) are punished with death. The guilty woman is burnt alive\u2014a hole is made in the ground and filled with combustibles, into which the woman is cast; this punishment is called labuh gui (to fall or be cast into the fire). The man is weighted with stones and drowned in the sea; this is called labuh batu.\u00b9 This penalty, however, especially the burning of the woman, is not always carried out so relentlessly. In several cases which came to my knowledge, both the man and the woman were drowned; in another case, where the guilty man had escaped vengeance by flight, the woman, at the command of her father (a Gusti in Kutta), was killed with the creese by a relation, her mother's brother, after having been adorned with flowers and fine clothes, and rendered fearless by opium and strong drink.\n\nThere are, then, no mixed castes in Bali. In the \"Usana Bali\" (l. l. p. 262) different classes of S\u00fbdras are mentioned\u2014viz., Mandesa, Gaduh, Dangka, Batu-haji, Pasek, Kabayan, Ngukuhin, Talikup; these, however, are not different castes, but are all S\u00fbdras, some of whom have been degraded to this caste from that of the Wesyas, and still maintain, in a political sense, a higher position than the common S\u00fbdras.\u00b2\n\nChandilas, nevertheless, exist in Bali, but they are not chandilas by birth; there can be none such in Bali. They are afflicted with malignant and contagious diseases, and especially leprosy. Such diseases are ascribed to the curse of some deity or of a Padanda. These persons may not reside in the kampongs,\n\n\u00b9 [Jacobs, l. l. p. 34.]\n\u00b2 [R. van Eck in \"Tijdschrift voor Ned. Indi\u00eb,\" 1859, vol. i. p. 129.]\nand are found in such places as the frontiers of two hostile States (Mengwi and Tabanan), where they live in misery and without intercourse with the rest of the people. I have seen others on the high roads; their employments are named by Crawfurd.\n\n**Brahmans.**\n\nAll Brahmans in Bali trace their descent from Padanda Wahu Rawuh, who, according to the Brahmans of the present time, lived in or was descended from Kediri; his descendants went thence to Majapahit, and from Majapahit to Bali. According to the Javanese accounts, a number of \u015aiva-Brahmans made their appearance in Majapahit, shortly before the fall of that place, from India, and fled upon the destruction of that kingdom to the East and to Bali. The statements of the Balinese upon historical and geographical subjects are extremely inaccurate. According to some, Kediri was situated in Baratawarsa (the holy land of India). If we accepted this as true, we should be able to reconcile the accounts of Java and Bali respecting the arrival of \u015aiva-Brahmans at Majapahit; but there are many reasons against this. Jayabaya is said by some Balinese to have been a king in Baratawarsa; undoubted Javanese accounts, however, state that he ruled in Kediri in Java, and all the Kavi works of most importance were composed under him and his predecessor, Ayer Langia. The Brahmans, who composed these works, must therefore have come from India at an earlier period and acquired the Kavi language in Java. We must bear also in mind here the localization of Indian places in Java.\n\nWahu or Bahu Rawuh means \"the newly-arrived\" (bahu is the Malay bahru; rawuh, Jav.-Bal., is equal to the Mal. datang). He is also named Bhagavan Dvijendra, the holy Brahman prince (dvija is a Brahman, one born twice\u2014the second time through initiation into religion and sacred literature, and through assuming the sacred band, Upavita). Indra is generally king, prince; thus we have Gajendra, prince of elephants, R\u0101k\u1e63hasendra, prince of the R\u0101k\u1e63hasas, namely, R\u0101vana. His two names, therefore, are not family-names, but merely indicate his position; he was the leader of a colony of Brahmans which came from India. Concerning his sojourn in Kediri or in Majapahit and Bali, the accounts, as we have seen, are uncertain; but, according to the accounts of the priests themselves, the five existing subdivisions of the Brahmans in Bali are descended from him and his five wives. We have:\n\n1. Br\u0101hma\u1e47a Kamenu. (Kamenu is in Gyanyar.) They are descended from Wahu Rawuh and a Brahmanic woman (Brahmana-Brahmani); according to Indian notions, these alone would have the full rights and dignities of Brahmans, yet we find that, in\nspite of their purer descent, they do not enjoy greater honour than their brethren who are of inferior birth. The rank of the Brahmins depends upon their ability, their personal appearance, and their conduct, so that even in youth the qualities of a powerful Pandita may be recognized. The supernatural power attributed to them, and not their descent, therefore, determines the choice of the domestic priests of the princes. Political reasons also have their weight. Br\u00e2hmana Kamenu are found in Boleleng.\n\n2. Br\u00e2hmana of Gelgel. (Gelgel is the ancient seat of the Deva-agung, already mentioned in the account of the Dutch envoys in 1635, in Crawfurd, \"History of the Indian Archipelago,\" vol. ii. p. 244 seq.; it is also referred to in the Malayan Manuscript of Abdullah\u2014\"Tijdschrift voor Nederlandsch Indie,\" Jaargang 7, 2de Deel, p. 166\u2014where it is erroneously written Gila gila in the translation.) They are descendants of Wahu Rawuh and a Kshatriya woman; they are called Br\u00e2hmana-geniten, and include most of the Brahmins in Kloungkong, Mengui, Bangli, and those of Sanor in Badong. The last-mentioned place is chiefly inhabited by Brahmins; none of those at Badong, however, are of high rank, but the Padanda Agung of Somawati, and the Padanda Made Aleng Kacheng in Taman Intaran, both belonging to other subdivisions of the Brahmins, are the domestic priests of the princes. Some Brahmins in Boleleng, also, came originally from Sanor.\n\n3. Br\u00e2hmana-Nuaba. These are descended from Wahu Rawuh and a Kshatriya widow (Balu manis, that is, \"a short time married\"). Their original seat is the kampong Nuaba in Gyanyar; hence came those of Sindhu in Karang-Assem, and of this family is the Padanda Agung in Sindhuwati, near Taman Intaran, who, some twenty years ago, left Karang-Assem for political reasons, and was received with gladness in Badong.* He is the chief domestic priest in Badong, and his brother or cousin in Gyanyar.\n\n4. Br\u00e2hmana-mas: descended from Wahu Rawuh and a Wesya woman.\u2020 Their original seat is the kampong Mas in Gyanyar. The family of the Padanda Made Aleng Kacheng in Taman Intaran came from that place. He is also a domestic priest, and although he is younger than and became a Padanda long after the Padanda Agung was already a domestic priest, still,\n\n* He had correspondence with Gyanyar at a time when Gyanyar, allied with Badong, was at enmity with Karang-Assem; he therefore lost his position in Karang-Assem, and, together with his brother, was invited by the princes of Gyanyar and Badong, received with much ceremony, and appointed to the office of domestic priest.\n\n\u2020 In general, the Br\u00e2hmana-geniten, descended from a Kshatriya woman, seem to be sought after by the princes in the States governed by Kshatriyas\u2014and the Br\u00e2hmana-mas, descended from a Wesya woman, where the Wesyas rule\u2014on account of their connection with these castes.\non account of his learning, his morals and the sakti ascribed to him, he is held in the highest honour in Badong and Gyanjar. There are also Br\u00e1hmaya-mas in Tabanan.\n\n5. Br\u00e1hmaya kayu \u015bunya (kayu \u015bunya is literally empty tree,\u2014this seems to be an allusion to the position of the woman from whom they are descended, for she was a slave, and was therefore without education and learning). They trace their descent to Wahu Rawuh by a slave. To this subdivision belong part of the Brahmins in Mengui.\n\nThe Brahmins are very numerous in Bali; their position as regards the prince depends upon whether they are ordinary Brahmins (Idas) or Padandas\u2014i.e., learned priests. The former are dependent upon the prince, must follow in war, may be employed as envoys, and may be banished from the country, if they do not strictly obey the prince's commands. Nevertheless, they are of higher rank than the princes, and can marry daughters of princes, while the princes may not marry Brahmanic women. On account of their large number, a considerable portion of them live in extreme poverty, and they do not disdain to cultivate the rice-fields, to engage in the fisheries, and to do manual work for money.\n\nThe Padandas are Brahmins who have received a complete education from another Padanda (their Guru). They must be thoroughly acquainted with religion and with literature.\n\nIn order to become a Padanda, they undergo all kinds of tests, to show their knowledge and their submission to the Guru. Thus, for instance, they place their heads under the Guru's foot, and drink the water that runs off his feet during his ablutions. Many other ceremonies precede their consecration, and a certain amount of wealth is required to defray the expenses, so that the dignity of Padanda mostly remains in a family which has already grown rich by means of this position. Others are supported and helped to become Padandas by the Rajas. The mark of the dignity is a staff, danda, which they receive from the Guru, and which gives them power to guide and to punish men in all things relating to religion. After this staff they are called Padanda, that is, \"bearing a staff.\" Their other name, Pandita, merely indicates their knowledge; Pandita is \"learned,\" and is explained in Bali by prajna, Sanskrit, and pintar, Mal.\n\nThe domestic priest, Purohita (Sanskrit idem), is chosen from the Padandas by the prince; or sometimes the prince helps an Ida whom he thinks clever and upright to become a Padanda, and then makes him his domestic priest. He is then the spiritual teacher (Guru) of the prince, who becomes his \u015bishya or pupil, makes the sembah* to him, and thereby shows his inferiority to the priest; he always sits on a raised seat (see Crawfurd, \"Asiatic\n\n1 [The Sanskrit danda is written dandia in Javanese and Balinese.]\n\n* The sembah is not an ordinary token of courtesy in Bali. The upper\nResearches,\u201d vol. xiii. p. 110). The domestic priest is consulted in all religious and political matters, and even in the ordinary affairs of life, in taking up arms, in choosing wives, &c. He alone teaches the worship of the Pitara and conducts the cremations of the princely families. In all offerings, both domestic and for the State, the advice of the domestic priest is acted upon; he is present in his elevated place opposite the offerings, and blesses the ceremonies by means of prayers from the Vedas.\n\nSometimes the word Purohita is applied generally to all priests who carry the staff (Padandas). It is these whom Raffles heard spoken of under the name of Mapurwita or Mapurwita. Purwita is the corrupted pronunciation of Purohita, which latter word I first recognized in good manuscripts; mapurohita (or mapurwita) means the being a purohita, or the collective Purohitas.*\n\nGuru loka, \u201cteacher of the world,\u201d is a name applied only to a few chosen Purohitas or Padandas, who present offerings for an entire kingdom; there are one or two of these in each of the different States in Bali. They are the special Gurus and counsellors of the chief prince, and are also the Gurus of the loka, of the world, or the subjects of a State.\n\nThe prince can also call other Padandas to perform less important religious functions, and the smaller rajas (who are of inferior birth) can likewise choose a Guru out of the rest of the Padandas.\n\nThe present Guru lokas in the southern States, who exercise great influence upon the actions of the princes, are:\n\nIn Klungkong\u2014\n1. Padanda Wayahan Pidada, who is a Br\u0101hma\u1e47a-nuaba (balu-manis).\n2. Padanda K'tut Ngrurah, a Br\u0101hma\u1e47a-g\u0113niten. He lives in the kampong of Dawan.\n\nIn Gyanyar\u2014\n1. Padanda Wayahan Kakeran, a Br\u0101hma\u1e47a-nuaba, cousin of the Padanda Agung in Badong. He lives in the kadaton of Sindhuwati, in the kampong of Kramas.\n\nIn Budong\u2014\n1. Padanda Agung, Br\u0101hma\u1e47a-nuaba. He resides in Sindhuwati (or Somawati), near Taman Intaran, and is the father-in-law of\n2. Padanda Made Al\u00e8ng Kacheng, Br\u0101hma\u1e47a-mas, in Taman Intaran.\n\ncastes only make it to the prince, and to the Padandas who are Guru loka. The reason of this is, that to the sembah is added an inward formula of reverence out of a Mantra or the Vedas; by making them to other persons of rank they would humble themselves too much.\n\n* The explanation formerly given (\u201cTijdschrift voor N. I.,\u201d Jaarg. 8, Deel 4) of Purwita, by means of purva and ita, thus falls to the ground.\nIn Tabanan\u2014\n\n1. Padanda Jumpung, Br\u0101hma\u1e47a-ge\u00f1iten, in Pasekan, to the north of the kadaton in Tabanan.\n\nIn Mengwi\u2014\n\n1. Padanda Putu, Br\u0101hma\u1e47a kayu \u015b\u0101nya, resides in Kaba-kaba. On account of their low birth the Br\u0101hma\u1e47a kayu \u015b\u0101nya appear to receive much less respect than the rest; yet we find a Guru loka among their number, although the men of Badong assert that the people in Mengwi are grossly ignorant. But Badong and Mengwi are old enemies.\n\nThe Brahmans also have many wives from among the people, but the children always remain Brahmans.* There is not a single one of pure blood, but, at any rate, care is taken that a Brahman does not have too much \u015a\u016bdra blood among his ancestors. If, in three generations, no woman of high birth has married into the family, the descendants lose all rank, and are treated by the princes as Sudras, and are obliged to perform service as vassals. It is the same with the other two upper castes.\n\nThe Brahmans' wives of low extraction, especially if they have children, are ennobled by the husband; their rank in life, it is true, is much inferior to that of women of high birth, and their husbands give them nothing (they have to maintain themselves and their children), but, after death, they are burnt as Brahmanic women, and enjoy the honour of the Pit\u0101ras.\n\nThe women of high birth share in all the privileges of their husbands. They are also instructed in the Vedas, themselves present offerings with the mumbling of the Vedas, and assist the Belas at cremations. They are also called Padanda, with the addition of istri, which is the highest title for women in Bali. (In the Sanskrit stri only means \"woman,\" in Bali \"princely woman,\" compare putri.)\n\nKshatriyas.\n\nIn India the Kshatriyas, the second caste, are, according to law, those who, alone, bear arms and defend the country. The princes are of this caste. But, in the present day, there are no longer any pure Kshatriyas in India; even the Rajaputras of R\u0101jasthan are not regarded as of pure extraction. The profession of arms has thus come into the hands of the whole people. The same thing has occurred in Bali. The r\u0101jas and their fami-\n\n* Raffles, App. K., p. 238, says that the children of a priest by a woman of lower rank are called Bujangga, but this nowhere came to my knowledge. See below respecting the word Bujangga [the note in the section on Caste in Java]. In the \"Tijdschrift v. N. I.\" Jaargang 7, vol. ii. p. 172, subdivisions (Pomah, Anggana, &c.) of Brahmans are mentioned, whose existence I did not discover, in spite of my repeated inquiries.\nlies, at least, are said to be Kshatriyas, but this is but partially the case. The highest prince, the Deva Agung, is a Kshatriya, but most of the other princes are of the third caste, the Wesya. The Kshatriyas no doubt came to Java only in small numbers. In Java the Usana Jawa enumerates Kshatriyas of Koripan (Panjis-seat), Gaglang, Kediri, and Janggala. The chiefs of the court of Jawa or Kediri, who were Kshatriyas and Wesyas, are mentioned in the Rangga Lawe. This, the largest kingdom in Java, did not contain many Kshatriyas; they are called Mahisa or K'bo (buffalo, to indicate their strength), and Rangga (Jav. ronggo); their names are as follow: Mahisa Bungalan, K'bo Wilalungan, K'bo Siluman, K'bo Jerang, K'bo Kanigara, K'bo Chaluk, K'bo T'ki, K'bo Taluktak, Ki Mahisa Sapati, K'bo Mundarang, and further Rangga Smi, Rangga Mayang, Rangga Palana, Rangga Ralengsong, Rangga Pasung, Rangga Wirada, Rangga Rabete, Rangga Sumbi, Rangga Sampana, and Anurangga Sunting. These are all the Kshatriyas who existed in the largest kingdom of Java. A particular sort of creese is attributed to each of them, and these creeses have crossed over to Bali through Majapahit. The Kshatriya families themselves, however, have not crossed to Bali, with the exception of the Deva Agung and his half-brothers, Arya Damar and six others. The pure Kshatriyas were probably exterminated in the numerous Javanese wars, and in the destruction of Majapahit, and the royal family of the Deva Agung also seems to have once (either in Bali or Java) been on the verge of extinction, for the reigning prince Taruna (a youth, unmarried) had no children. Here, however, a new race was raised by a priest, Dang hyang Kapakisan, out of a stone, batu henggong (see \"Us. Bali,\" p. 344). The race thus sprung from batu henggong reigns in Bali at the present time, and from it the Kshatriyas are descended. The descendants of the half-brothers (Arya Damar and the others) were in later times degraded to Wesyas. Thus all the Kshatriyas now existing in Bali trace their descent from the Deva Agung\u2014a fact which would surprise us, for their number is considerable, were it not that there are but few of them in Badong, Tabanan, Mengwi, and Karang-Assem; and the rest can have descended from the one Deva Agung (who lived 400 years ago) just as well as 800 Gusti Pam'chuttan in Badong, counting only the heads of families who have houses of their own, and are married, may have sprung from the Raja Ngururah Sakti Pam'chuttan (who four generations ago was prince of all Badong, excepting Jambe). At the present day the Kshatriyas are still reigning only in Klungkung, Bangli, and Gyanyar; formerly there was also a Kshatriya dynasty in Boleleng, descended from the Deva Agung, and its descendants now live in Badong. This dynasty was expelled by Wesyas seven generations (?) ago. The same thing took place in earlier times in Karang-Assem.\nTwo hundred years ago (1633) the Kshatriyas and all the princes of Bali seem still to have been subject to the Deva Agung, who is called prince of Bali by the Dutch envoys of that time. The authority of the Deva Agung was very much weakened by a war with Karang-Assem about a hundred years ago, in which the ancient seat of Gilgel (to the east of Klongkong, near the sea) was destroyed. Since that time Karang-Assem and Boleleng, which was conquered by it, have no longer paid homage to the Deva Agung. Soon after this, also, an insignificant Deva in Gyanyar raised himself to the rank of a great prince by expelling the relatives of the Deva Agung from the various provinces which form the present Gyanyar. The new dynasty of Gyanyar, however, returned to the sovereignty of the Deva Agung. Bangli, where a Kshatriya prince also rules, acknowledged the Deva Agung until recently, but now has no connection with Klongkong. Tabanan has withdrawn from the supremacy of the Deva Agung, because Karang-Assem and Boleleng do not pay him homage. Thus there remain only Mengui, Badong, and Gyanyar which acknowledge the Deva Agung as Sovereign of Bali. Karang-Assem and Boleleng use the name of the Deva Agung as their Sovereign whenever it suits their purpose, but they pay him no homage (sembah) and send no presents (or tribute) to Klongkong. Badong also yields him but little, and, in fact, has always been opposed to his interests, although openly it pays him homage, sends envoys to him, and contributes a little to great offerings and feasts in Klongkong.\n\nDessak, Pradeva, and Pungakan are names of Kshatriyas who have much Sudra blood in their veins.\n\nWESYAS.\n\nThis caste, from a political point of view, is at present the most important in Bali. To it belong the princes of Karang-Assem, Boleleng, Mengui, Tabanan, and Badong, and also the prince of Lombok. It is much more numerous than the Kshatriyas. The race of the princes of Karang-Assem, Boleleng, Mengui, and Lombok is descended from Patih Gaja Madda, the second general of Majapahit, who, together with Arya Damar, conquered Bali; he was a Wesya of Majapahit, while Arya Damar, the chief conqueror, was a Kshatriya, and a half-brother of the prince. Arya Damar was the ancestor of the princes of Tabanan and Badong; these, however, are now Wesyas, having apparently been degraded to this caste, about 300 years ago, by the Deva Agung. The reason of this degradation is said to have been that these Kshatriyas wore their hair after the manner of the Wesyas. In the present day there is no perceptible difference between the Kshatriyas and Wesyas in the mode of wearing\nthe hair; the Deva Agung wear it exactly as the ancient Kassiman did, and the young Kshatriyas and Wesyas both wear theirs sometimes loose and sometimes bound up (in the Sivaitic manner) at the back of the head. The true reason was no doubt political; it was desired to humble the powerful race of Arya Damar, and the rest of the Kshatriyas, who were descended from the Deva Agung, and were already very numerous at that time, endeavoured to obtain more power. This object was not attained, but the princes of Tabanan and Badong have remained Wesyas.\n\nWe have seen above that the Kshatriyas of Daha and Majapahit bear the titles of Mahisa or K'bo and Rangga. Patih, Demang, and Tumenggung are given as names for the Wesyas. Mantris, who in Java now occupy the lowest position among the native chiefs, can, according to the Balinese, be of either caste; this is explained by the original meaning of the word Mantri; in Sanskrit it means \"Minister,\" and is thus applicable to any one who fills this position, whether he be Kshatriya or Wesya. Patih also was a much higher rank in ancient Java and Bali than it is in Java now: Gaja Madda, who is stated to be the ancestor of four princely families in Bali, and is regarded as the incarnation of Vishnu, bears the title of Patih. And further, the first Deva Agung (see \"Usana Java\") appoints the conqueror of Bali and governor of Tabanan, Arya Damar, to be Patih or first Minister, who must be consulted on all occasions. Of the Javanese titles we also find that of B'kel in Bali; it belongs, however, not to members of one of the three upper castes, but to Sudras, and is equal to mandur in Java. In Bali they are called Parb'kel, Pam-b'kel, or Prab'kel; the original name is Prab'kel, which, like Pragusti and Pradeva (usually pronounced Pergusti and Perdeva) means the assembly of the B'kels (Gustis and Devas).\n\nOf the principal Wesyas of the Court of Daha (Kediri), the following are named in the \"Usana Java\": Mantri Bawong, Kala Mudong, Tumenggung Parungsari, D'mang Drawalika, Gebob Basah, Lobar (the creese of this man's shape is still used by the princes in Karang-Assem, according to the Pusaka in Ngalihan), Kala Limpung, Buta Wilis, Bubar Baleman, Jalak Katengeng. From such Wesya families, as well as from the real brothers of Arya Damar, a great number of Balinese have sprung; but all, except the descendants of Arya Damar and Patih Gaja Madda, are of no importance, and most of them have become Sudras. A few still bear the title of Gusti and have followers, but the rest are, in all respects, like the Sudras. The reason of this is, that their forefathers in Bali were conquered and displaced by the races of Arya Damar and Patih Gaja Madda.\n\nThe Wesyas were originally intended for commerce, agriculture, and the exercise of arts and handicrafts. This is known in Bali, but the principal Gustis despise these occupations, and they are\nonly disposed to carry on trade for the sake of obtaining the money required for opium-smoking and cock-fights. Trade, however, is not solely in the hands of the Wesyas; all the other castes, also, take part in it.\n\nIn order to become better acquainted with the present position of the Dewas and Gustis in Bali, we shall give here an account of the princely families and their descendants.\n\n**The Princely Families.**\n\nWe have already referred briefly to the fact that all the Kshatriyan princes, and all the present Kshatriyas, trace their descent to the Deva Agung. The princes and Gustis of Tabanan and Badong are descended from Arya Damar; and, finally, the princes and Gustis of Mengwi, Karang-Assem, Buleleng, and Lombok derive their pedigree from Patih Gaja Madda. This carries us back to the time of the conquest of Bali by the Javanese of Majapahit.\n\nAn ancient connection between Java and Bali is indicated in the \"Usana Bali.\" Bali was in the possession of evil spirits, or giants, that is, the Balinese were not yet Hindus (comp. Abdullah, in the \"Tijdsch. voor Ne\u00earlands Indi\u00eb,\" Jaargang 7, vol. ii. p. 160, sqq.). A few Hindus from Majapahit had settled in Bali, and had a temple in Bazuki (so-called after the Indian serpent-king Vasuki who, in the Indian and Balinese mythology, accompanies \u015aiva and plays an important part. They were oppressed, however, by the infidel princes and people. The account of the descent of the gods and the defeat of the Maya Danawa and the demons indicates the triumph of Hinduism. The \"Usana Bali\" does not tell us by what earthly means this religion was established, and the reason of this seems to be, (1) that, in order to attain its full sanctity, the religion must be introduced by the gods themselves; (2) that it was desirable or necessary to spare the feelings of the conquered people (the original Balinese) by representing them as conquered, not by men, but by gods. The \"Usana Bali\" is intended only for the people.\n\nIn the \"Usana Java,\" however, we find traces of the true conquest. It is represented, here, as taking place immediately before the crossing over of the Deva Agung, the chief of Majapahit; but at that time Bali (according to the same \"Usana Java\") had already become a province of the kingdom of Majapahit, and is merely subdued a second time after a revolt of the governor. The institution of castes and the Hindu religion evidently existed in Bali previously to this, as is clear also from the narrative of Abdullah; but the revolt and the defeat of the Governor of Bali afforded an opportunity of dividing the land among the nobles of Majapahit, and the prince of Majapahit, or his son, came to reside in this island after the fall of the kingdom of Majapahit. This destruc-\ntion of Majapahit was effected, according to the Javanese accounts, by Muhammadans; according to the Balinese, the kingdom and city were deserted in consequence of a disease caused by a buta (demon).\n\nAccording to the \"Usana Java,\" Arya Damar and Patih Gaja, Madda were sent from Majapahit in the capacity of generals against the rebellious Bali. Arya Damar conquers the north, while Patih Gaja Madda remains inactive in the south; but, on the approach of Arya Damar, the latter portion also submits to this victorious general. The crossing over of the prince of Majapahit is caused, according to the \"Usana Java,\" by the appearance in Bali of a demoniacal king, Mraja Danawa (another infidel, therefore!); the latter is of the family of Maya Danawa in the \"Usana Bali,\" and refers to the event that forms the subject of that writing. At that time Arya Damar was in Majapahit, and on the receipt of the intelligence that this Raksasa Mraja Danawa is exercising his power in Bali, the prince of Majapahit himself sets out against Bali with Arya Damar and his whole army; after defeating the Raksasa prince, who, when he can resist no longer, flies away through the air, the prince of Majapahit establishes himself in Gelgel. This account is obviously improbable, and was perhaps invented to conceal from the original Balinese the manner in which, and the reasons for which, the prince of Majapahit, or his son, left his kingdom to settle in Bali.*\n\nWhat would seem nearest the truth in these accounts is this: Arya Damar had subdued rebellious Bali, and again compelled respect for the prince of Majapahit; a short time afterwards the kingdom of Majapahit fell to the ground (through war or other disasters), and the surviving prince, or one of his sons, came over to peaceful Bali. The Balinese naturally regard this arrival as an honour, and look upon the loss of Majapahit as of little moment, for they say that place (and all Java) became infested with evil spirits. The princes do not seem to have so easily forgotten the loss of their great kingdom in Java; hence their continual wars with Blambangan, and even in Passuruan (Raffles, vol. ii. p. 200, sqq., \"History of Java\"), whence, however, they finally had to withdraw. Blambangan (the country near Banyuwangi) for a long time still belonged to Bali. The wildness of this country is partly owing to the wars with the Balinese, who were unable to hold it. It is remarkable that the opposite side of Bali, Jembrana, is also, to a great extent, desolate; here, as in Majapahit, the reason of this desolation is said to be that the dwelling of a king of demoniacal form made the land unsafe. But both Jembrana and Blambangan were really laid waste by the long wars between Java\n\n* The \"Usana Java\" does not give the name of the prince who became the first Deva Agung in Bali. According to other accounts, his name was Deva Agung K'tut, and this is given by Raffles and confirmed by the Balinese.\nand Bali, and, even now, are little cultivated, more for security's sake than from fear of the demoniacal king. The longing of the Balinese to regain their lost country has shown itself in the expedition of the Bolelengers against Banyuwangi under the English rule. They have also attempted to gain in the East what they have lost in the West\u2014hence the conquest of Lombok and the attack on Sembawa, where they were stopped by the Dutch Government.\n\nAfter the settlement of the Deva Agung in Bali at Gelgel, the land is divided among the chief men in the army and the Court. Arya Damar received the great land of Tabanan, and became a Patih, first Minister of the Deva Agung. The prince could not undertake anything without consulting him, and this privilege descends to his offspring, and forms the ground of the present grievances of the princes of Tabanan and Badong, who never forget this ancient privilege, and, as the Deva Agung does not keep the old promise, no longer consider themselves bound to him. Badong, however, preserves, for political reasons, the appearance of subjection. Arya Damar also obtains the title of Arya Kencheng (Kenjeng or Kengjang) is the title for princely Javanese invested with authority, and is also given to the Resident, the Government, &c.). The number of his men is said to have been 40,000. Smaller governorships were also given to Arya Damar's brothers; to Arya Sento, the countries of Pachungs, the present Marga, belonging formerly to Mengui, but now to Tabanan; to Arya Beleteng, the country of Pinatih, since conquered by the princes of Badong, but still a separate kingdom; to Arya Waringin, that of Kapal in the present Mengui; to Arya Blog, that of Kabakaba in Mengui; to Arya Kapakisan, that of Habiansimal in Mengui; to Arya Binchaluku, that of Tangkas in Klungkong. Besides these brothers of Arya Damar, Arya Manguri is mentioned as governor in Dawuh in Karang-Assem, and the three principal Wesyas, Tan Kuber, Tan Kawur, and Tan Mundur (names, really, symbolical), also receive a domain. In the \"Pamendanga,\" a sort of history of the princes and priests, however, of little value, the governorships allotted to these nobles are somewhat different, but, at any rate, this work mentions Patih Gaja Madda as governor of Mengui, a fact confirmed by all Balinese, but omitted from the \"Usana Java.\"* We thus see Bali, at the very outset, divided among governors; these could soon change from governors into independent princes, such as we now find. In the year 1633, according to the Dutch Envoys, the Deva Agung seems still to have been the only prince in Bali, and it is probable that he was regarded as such and had influence over the whole of Bali until about 100 years ago, when Gelgel,\n\n* The \"Usana Bali\" betrays partiality for the race of Arya Damar.\nhis ancient seat, was destroyed. The countries adjoining Klongkong, Bangli, Gyanjar, and also Buleleng, seem to have been immediately under the Deva Agung, and were then, in course of time, given as governorships to members of his family. Here also, after the degradation of the race of the Arya Damar, were the only remaining Kshatriyas, but even these were partly expelled by the Wesyas. The history of Arya Damar's descendants is remarkable only on account of the conquest of Badong and the founding of this kingdom. The race of Patih Gaja Madda has much more influence upon the history of the whole of Bali. This chief, the second general of the princes of Majapahit, had his seat in Mengui. The palace of Mengui is one of the oldest. Abdullah (p. 163) even makes the Deva Agung reside in Mengui from the first; the information I have obtained as to this point, however, agrees with the \"Usana Java,\" where the Deva Agung has his first seat in Gelgel; proceeding subsequently to Klongkong. To Mengui belonged, besides the present country of that name, the greater portion of Badong (the smaller, eastern portion of Badong, formed the kingdom of Pinatih, which in later times was subject to Mengui); and, further, a portion of the present Gyanjar, Kramas, and the land of Marga, which now belongs to Tabanan. It was thus a considerable domain, and as large, if not larger, than Tabanan. Arya Damar's brothers had, it is true, various portions of the present Mengui, but they all appear to have been speedily subjected to the power of Gaja Madda and his successors; the kingdom of Pinatih alone remained under the descendants of Arya Damar, but it became tributary to Mengui. The position of Bali at this period (about 250 years ago) may therefore be thus described: Klongkong, Gyanjar (with the exception of Kramas), Bangli, and Buleleng belonged to the Deva Agung and to punggawas (governors) of his family; Tabanan to the descendants of Arya Dama; Mengui with Badong and parts of Gyanjar and Tabanan (Kramas and Marga) to the descendants of Gaja Madda. Karang-Assem was probably still under the descendants of Arya Manguri (at least partially). A change in this state of affairs was caused by the princes of Mengui conquering Karang-Assem, and a Gusti of Tabanan establishing himself and his descendants in Badong, and forming a separate independent kingdom, after being for a time subject to Mengui.\n\nAnother and a more important change began about one hundred years ago, in consequence of the war of Karang-Assem against Klongkong. The cause of this war was the putting to death of a prince of Karang-Assem, by command of the Deva Agung. The prince in question did penance after the manner of the Indian yogis; he gave himself up entirely to contemplation, and, thereby, neglected all outward worldly things so much that he grossly transgressed decorum\u2014e.g., he allowed his excrement to\nfall where he happened to be sitting. When he was in Klongkong, he conducted himself in the same manner, and thus offended the Deva Agung and the nobles of the court of Gelgel. On his return journey, he was killed from an ambush by command of the Deva Agung. He left three sons, who immediately resolved to avenge his death. The penance performed by their murdered father rendered their power irresistible in the eyes of the Balinese; the real fact is, however, that the race of Gaja Madda, which then possessed all the extensive country of Mengwi and Karang-Assem, was the most powerful in Bali. They defeated the Deva Agung and destroyed his royal seat in Gelgel. The Deva Agung retained his territory, however, and seems, from this time forward, to have fallen into the state of dependence under the Karang-Assem family in which we now find him. Peace was restored by marriages, and Klongkong was held in subjection. The wife of the Deva Agung last-deceased was a princess of Karang-Assem, and governed the whole land for him so completely that she even dared to murder another wife of her husband, a princess of Badong. From this time the decline of the power of the Deva Agung is principally to be dated. He was a conquered prince, and, although he retained his territory, and the conqueror remained in outward appearance his inferior, yet his prestige among his own people was seriously lowered. In addition to this, the princes of Kareng-Assem no longer performed feudal service in Klongkong, but simply conceded to the Deva Agung the title of first ruler of Bali, without paying him tribute.\n\nThis victory had yet other important consequences for the family of Karang-Assem. The conquerors of Klongkong could without much difficulty also attack Boleleng, where dynasties had already changed several times, and which at that time was certainly in a weak state. They took this country also, and one of the brothers became king of Boleleng. At that time the most ancient dynasty of the Kshatriyas had already ceased to exist in Boleleng; * the statements of the people of Badong asserting that it was driven from the throne seven generations ago, retiring to Badong, where it still lives, subordinate to the ruling Wesyas, but yet of some distinction. (Its head is the Deva Made Rahi in Kutta, who has obtained the chief command of that place from the rajas of Badong.) One of the succeeding princes of Boleleng, also of Wesyan blood (being descended from Arya Beleteng in Pinatih), was Panji; he, however, did not hold the kingdom long. Whether he expelled the Kshatriyas is not certain, nor is it known whether the family of Karang-Assem immediately succeeded him.\n\n* This is open to doubt. In that case how can Kshatriyas have ruled in Boleleng in Crawfurd's time (1812)?\nThe last exploit of the victorious brothers of Karang-Assem was the conquest of Lombok. Here, also, one of the brothers remained as prince, keeping five thousand Balinese families with him, from whom the present Balinese population of Lombok have sprung.\n\nIn the south, the Gusti family from Tabanan had, in the meantime, subdued the whole of the western portion of Badong, namely, Pinatih: the eastern portion was conquered somewhat later.\n\nAbout the same time (three generations ago) the family of the Deva Agung was also robbed of its possessions in Gyanyar, and an inferior Deva (Pungakan), named Deva Mangis, founded the present kingdom of Gyanyar.\n\nA hundred years later, therefore, we have the following state of affairs in Bali:\u2014(1) The Deva Agung in Klongkong, only in name still prince of all Bali, and with his territory reduced to Bangli and Klongkong. Bangli, however, had its own princes, who were also Kshatriyas and descended from the Deva Agung, but of lower birth than the Kshatriyas in Klongkong. In Gyanyar the relations of the Deva Agung were conquered by a Deva of insignificant rank. (2) The family of Gaja Madda ruling in Mengui, Karang-Assem, Buleleng, and Lombok. Mengui, their original country, had, however, already lost a large piece of territory to the newly arisen Badong. (3) The family of Arya Damar in Tabanan and in the newly founded Badong.\n\nSince that time there have still been quarrels without end among the eight States which we have mentioned. We say eight, for Pahyangan was not a separate State, but belonged formerly to Bangli, and now to Mengui, and Jembrana has also, always, or for a very long time, been subject to Buleleng\u2014it was conquered twenty years ago by Badong, but retaken by Buleleng.\n\nThe most frequent wars have been between Badong and Mengui, with its allies Karang-Assem and Buleleng; and between Gyanyar and Mengui, allied with Bangli. The new kingdoms of Badong and Gyanyar soon became allies, although they have had a few small wars with each other, when one has been for and the other against the party of the Deva Agung. In general, they maintain friendly relations with the Deva Agung, pay him homage, and send him a few presents. To show the present condition of Bali, we will now speak of each State in particular.\n\n1. Klongkong, governed by the Deva Agung, is the smallest, and is not a rich country. His men are said to number 6000. Formerly there were members of his family in Nagara, Sukawati, and Pejeng (all in the present Gyanyar); the family also had Buleleng, but it was driven out thence and went to Badong. In Bangli, also, the Kshatriyan family is no longer related to the Deva Agung, but, down to the most recent period,\nthe Kshatriyas of Bangli were always true followers of, and paid homage to, those of Klongkong. At present, Bangli and Klongkong are bitter enemies. Gyanyar, Badong, and Mengui acknowledge the authority of the Deva Agung by presents and envoys. Karang-Assem and Buleleng acknowledge him as supreme prince, but pay him no homage, and, although they act in full harmony with Klongkong, they do so as an entirely independent State. Towards the Dutch Government, however, they make use of the pretended power of the Deva Agung, in order to represent their acts as controlled by the Deva Agung, and to take refuge behind him. Tabanan, Bangli, and Lombok do not even acknowledge the superior rank of the Deva Agung, much less give him presents.\n\nThe name of the present Deva Agung is G\u2019d\u00e9 Putra;* his sister, the daughter of the above-mentioned princess of Karang-Assem, is named Deva Agung Istri. The Deva Agung\u2019s mother was a Sudra woman, but the deceased Deva Agung had no male children by noble wives, and thus the son of a Sudra woman was obliged to succeed him.\n\n2. Gyanyar.\u2014This State is governed by Deva Pahan, a son of Deva Mangis, who died in October 1847. The family is Kshatriyan, but of low descent (on account of too much intermixture with Sudra blood), and is called pungakan (pungakan means fallen). Deva Pahan\u2019s great-grandfather, named Deva Mangis, was the founder of this State. He was commander of 200 men in the desa of Gyanyar, and was under the Punggawas of the Deva Agung, who were governors in Nagara, Sukawati, and Pejeng, and relations of the ruling Deva Agung. By deceit, violence, and poison he gained the mastery over these punggawas, and conquered from Mengui the country of Kramas. On account of his infamous deeds, his poisoning, &c., he is said to have changed after death into a serpent, which was kept for a long time in the palace at Gyanyar, but disappeared in the last few years. His success in all his undertakings was probably owing to the fact that he began in a time when Klongkong was defeated by Karang-Assem, and deprived of all power. Gyanyar, however, has submitted to the Deva Agung as the supreme ruler, and sends\n\n---\n\n* G\u2019d\u00e9 means the oldest son or daughter of the same mother among other than royal persons, and among Brahmans the usual word for this is Wayahan (old); M\u00e2te is the second (really the middle one, Sanskrit madhya); Nyoman, the third, if there be a fourth; K\u2019tut, the third or fourth (really the youngest). If there are more children, the same expressions are used, but are placed before the name instead of after it. Thus we have in Den Passar a raja Ngrurah K\u2019tut, and a K\u2019tut Ngrurah, both sons of the deceased prince, the brother of Kassiman. Putra is prince, but ought properly to be applied only to those of purely noble birth; in this case, however, the Deva Agung is the son of a Sudra woman, but, as the only one who could succeed to the throne, he was ennobled.\nhim numerous presents, which cause him to forget that his nearest relatives are disgracefully oppressed\u2014for the former punggawas are still living in Gyanyar, but they are under the command of a Pungakan. It thus appears that, all over Bali, noble birth is not sufficient to protect a family. Here, too, the stronger conquers, even though he be of the lowest extraction. Such a victorious family is then again elevated by noble marriages. Gyanyar is stated to contain 35,000 men, but not more than half this return can be taken as true. It is one of the most fertile and best-cultivated districts of Bali.\n\nGyanyar is allied with Badong, and acts as mediator in the disputes between this State and Klongkong. Its attitude towards Karang-Assem is neither friendly nor hostile. In the last Dutch expedition against Boleleng, Gyanyar, by command of the Deva Agung, sent 5000 men to assist; they arrived too late, however, and were not the best soldiers, but, on the contrary, the refuse of the kingdom.\n\nGyanyar has had many quarrels under the three princes bearing the name of Deva Mangis, chiefly with Bangli and Mengui, but also with other States. At the conquest of Mengui by Badong, Gyanyar was allied with the latter, and received a piece of territory on the frontier, Kadewatan. Gyanyar's friendship towards Badong is not to be relied on; hence the new campongs built by the raja Kassiman on the frontier of Badong.\n\n3. Bangli.\u2014The reigning prince is Deva G'de Putu Tangkeban.* His family also is descended from the first Deva Agung in Klongkong, but in rank it stands lower than the line of the Deva Agungs. Formerly this family ruled over two States\u2014Bangli and Taman-Bali. This close relationship was not sufficient to prevent the prince of the former State from seizing the latter and extirpating its princes. The same thing has, however, occurred to the families of Karang-Assem and of Lombok. Until about ten years ago, Bangli was attached to Klongkong; the prince of Bangli, the most warlike in Bali, was commander-in-chief (Senapati). Its enmity with Klongkong was brought about by the influence of the princess of Karang-Assem, who was married to the deceased Deva Agung. In its many wars with Karang-Assem, Boleleng, and Gyanyar, however, it lost part of its territory in the north, and lately also Pahyangan, which lies south of Bangli, and is now divided from Bangli itself by a strip of territory acquired by Gyanyar. Pahyangan has been won by Boleleng and ceded by this State to the Deva Agung, who again has handed it over to the government of the prince of Mengui, his Punggawa.\n\nBangli no longer acknowledges the Deva Agung, and has entered into friendly relations with Tabanan and Badong, which,\n\n* Putu is applied to a person at whose birth the grandfather or grandmother is still living.\nhowever, the surrounding hostile States render of little account. The war with Gyanyar has recently been stopped through the influence of Badong. The country has also suffered nothing from Karang-Assem and Buleleng since the first Dutch expedition; now, however, it is in great danger from the union of these two States and of Klongkong and Mengui. The men of Bangli are the bravest in Bali, and it is only by virtue of this quality that they have been able to hold their own against so many powerful enemies. Women also bear arms in this country. There are only fifty firearms in Bangli.*\n\n4. Mengui.\u2014The reigning prince is Anak Agung K'tut Agung. He murdered his elder brother, who was the first prince; the widow of the latter, Byang Agung, however, still has much influence. The families of Karang-Assem, Buleleng, and Lombok are of Menguian extraction. Patih Gaja Madda was governor of Mengui. According to some accounts, this Patih Gaja Madda was an incarnation of Vishnu, who has thus also assumed the body of a Wesya. The story probably originated when the family had subdued nearly the whole of Bali and Lombok. Another account says that Patih Gaja Madda vanished from the earth and left no children, the house of Mengui being descended from Ki Yasak, who married the granddaughter of Arya Damar against the will of her father, Arya Yasan. In ancient times Mengui included the whole of western Badong, while the eastern portion, the State of Pinatih, also acknowledged the supremacy of Mengui among the descendants of Arya Beleteng. Besides this, Kramas and Kadevatan of Gyanyar and Marga, in the mountain range of Tabanan, formerly belonged to Mengui. Kramas was conquered by Gyanyar, as we have seen;\n\n* The above, like all the rest of this account, was written in 1848. The third expedition despatched by the Dutch Government against the hostile States in Bali in 1849 has very much altered the position of several princes. The author has thought it desirable, however, not to alter his work on this account, but to describe Bali in the state in which it was when he left it. Now that Buleleng, Karang-Assem, and Bangli are better known, the public will of course have fresh information regarding them; hitherto, however, but little that is authentic has come to the author's ears, and he therefore gives the information which he gathered, to serve as far as possible as historical data. It is well known that the prince of Bangli, the faithful ally of the Dutch Government, has now, in addition to his own country, received from the Government the State of Buleleng, to be ruled under the sovereignty of Holland; also that Karang-Assem has been given to the prince of Mataram-Lombok, who believed he had a well-founded claim to it. The authority of the Deva Agung has also been still further lessened, both because he has been compelled to acknowledge the sovereignty of Holland, and because two princes, who previously did not recognize his authority, have now become his powerful and dreaded neighbours, who will always be ready and able to hold him in check. To avoid repetition, we need here only allude to the fact that the princes hitherto reigning in Buleleng and Karang-Assem, and the still better-known Gusti Jelanteg, have fallen in the struggle.\nwe shall speak of the rest in connection with Badong. Mengui was for some time, about twelve years, under the dominion of Badong, but is now again free from that kingdom and stands as a separate governorship under Klongkong. The house of Mengui is not only of the same origin as that of Karang-Assem, but is also allied to it by a very recent marriage between the prince of Karang-Assem and a princess of Mengui. Mengui must obey blindly the orders of the Deva Agung; it is, however, hostile to Badong and Tabanan, and is nearly neutralized by its position between these two States. The small piece of territory belonging to Mengui on the sea-coast is very much coveted by Badong, which, by obtaining it, would touch the frontier of its ally Tabanan. This piece of territory, however, is strongly defended by its rocky coast, which only leaves open a small path.\n\nThe hostility which exists among the Balinese is shown by, among other things, the diversion of water; Mengui, for instance, has dug a new bed on its territory for a river which formerly flowed into the sea in Badong, and by this means has left dry the rice-fields of Grobokkan on the borders of Badong.\n\n5. Karang-Assem.\u2014The reigning prince is Ngrurah* G'de Karang-Assem. The family is that of Gaja Madda, and the country was conquered by Mengui more than two hundred years ago. A list of the names of the princes of Karang-Assem is given in the \"Pamendanga,\" a work which we have mentioned above, but nothing is stated as to their acts. In the \"Usana Java,\" the governorship of Dawuh in Karang-Assem is held by Arya Manguri; it is not certain whether that family had the whole of Karang-Assem\u2014possibly part of it was in the possession of the Deva Agung. By the conquest of Karang-Assem by the house of Mengui, Klongkong was cut off from Boleleng, and the powerful royal family in the conquered State afterwards found it an easy matter to subdue Boleleng by itself.\n\nNo State has waged so many wars as Karang-Assem. We have spoken above of the victory over the Deva Agung and the destruction of Gelgel. The consequence of this was the subjugation of Boleleng and Lombok, and the family would perhaps have ended by making itself master of all Bali, Lombok, and Sembawa (Sembawa was actually attacked, but was spared through the intervention of the Dutch Government) but for its numerous civil wars. Many of the princes of Karang-Assem and of the conquered Boleleng were expelled by members of their own family. In\n\n*Ngrurah means something that overshadows, palindongan, a payong, and also the vault of heaven. The princes of the Wesyan race nearly all bear this title; they overshadow and protect the land. The prince of Mengui has not this title, for his country belongs to Klongkong, and is merely entrusted to the present prince as a fief of Klongkong: Ngrurah, Angrurah, Anglurah, is in Java Lurah, a chief of the fourth rank.\nLombok, also, the two princes of the house of Karang-Assem were at war with each other nine years ago, with the result that the chief prince, that of Karang-Assem-Lombok, was defeated by the prince of Mataram, and committed suicide. Of the Karang-Assem-Lombok family two children were saved, a son and a daughter of the last prince, and they are now living in Karang-Assem-Bali.* The rest of the family, including the women murdered each other in true Indian fashion, in order not to survive the shame of defeat. They even wished to murder also a European who had sided with them, in order to go to heaven (Svarga) all together. This method \"of quitting life by the members of the family murdering each other\" is also regarded in Bali as a Bela, and here also the Indian meaning of the word wela (\"sudden and easy death,\" see above) is applicable. Since the fall of Karang-Assem-Lombok, the princes of Karang-Assem-Bali, of Boleleng, and the Deva Agung, who is independent of them, have been enemies of Lombok, and do not acknowledge each other as lawful rulers. The prince of Lombok, which is also called Selaparang, is Ngrurah K'tut Karang-Assem.\n\nKarang-Assem is the most mountainous country of Bali, and grows little rice, but the dense population is very skilful in manual work, especially in wood-carving, whereby they gain their livelihood. According to the statements of the Balinese, it contains 50,000 men able to bear arms.\n\n6. Boleleng.\u2014The prince is Ngrurah Made Karang-Assem. The family comes from Karang-Assem, and thus is originally descended from Mengui and Patih Gaja Madda. The present prince is a brother of the prince of Karang-Assem. Many dynasties have ruled in Boleleng. Seven generations ago the Kshatriyan princes of Boleleng, relations of the Deva Agung, were expelled by a Wesyan family; to the latter belonged Ngrurah Panji, a descendant of Arya Beleteng. The surviving Kshatriyas of Boleleng now live in Badong. Boleleng was finally conquered four or five generations ago by Karang-Assem, but this did not put a stop to the wars, for the members of the Karang-Assem family could not agree together. The most profound peace reigns now, since two brothers have filled the thrones of Karang-Assem and Boleleng. According to Balinese statements, Boleleng has but 12,000 men capable of bearing arms; perhaps so few are returned in order to represent its conquest by the Government as of little importance.\n\nThe well-known Gusti Jelanteg is a cousin of the prince; his father was murdered by the late prince; yet the son now reigns, whilst the lawful king is but a shadow.\n\n* Perhaps these sole descendants have now been killed by the prince of Mataram-Lombok; at all events he was formerly in constant dread of these lawful heirs of Lombok.\n7. Tabanan.\u2014Prince Ratu* Ngrurah Agung. The family is that of Arya Damar, which is said to have remained pure, although here this is at any rate improbable, and in Badong is untrue. Tabanan does not engage in many wars; it has suffered defeat a few times from Buleleng, but has never been entirely conquered. In the war with Mengwi, in which the whole of that State was conquered by Badong and its allies, Gyanyar and Tabanan, Tabanan received the mountain-district of Marga. The more recent quarrels with Mengwi are of no importance and never result in anything. The men of Tabanan understand the art of war much less than the other Balinese. Two men of Tabanan are calculated to be no more than a match for one of Mengwi, and the people of Badong add to this that one man of Badong is equal to two of Mengwi.\u2020 The men able to bear arms are stated to be 100,000 in number (?). Under the prince of Tabanan stands that of Kediri, a relation of the former, ruling over a tolerably large territory.\n\nAnother Punggawa of Tabanan is the prince of the Marga already mentioned; the latter is not a Wesya, but a Sudra. His ancestor was a seller of palm-wine (tuak), who managed to gain the favour of the prince of Mengwi, and by him was made Punggawa. When the territory was transferred from Mengwi to Tabanan, the prince of Marga retained his position. (His district grows most of the coffee in Bali.) This instance is the only one which has come to my knowledge of a Sudra prince, but it indicates the decay of the institution of caste. One often hears the nobles say that Bali must go to the bad now that the Sudras or children of Sudra mothers become kings. Compare Deva Agung, raja Pamchutan.\n\n8. Badong.\u2014The three princes who together rule this State are\u2014(1) Ngrurah G'de Pamchutan, (2) Made Ngrurah in Den Passar, and (3) Ngrurah G'de (Kassiman). This State has been formed gradually. The western portion formerly belonged to Mengwi, and the eastern, the State of Pinatih, to the descendants of Arya Beleteng, who acknowledged the supremacy of Mengwi. Pinatih lies to the eastward of Kassiman, from the frontier of Gyanyar to Tanjang, opposite Serangan (at the place where the roadstead is on the eastern side). It comprises Gunung Rata, Sanor, Taman Intaran, Soong, and the island of Serangan, and is a very fertile district. The poorer western portion with Grobokkan, Legian, Kutta, Tuban, Jembaran, and the southern corner of Bali (the point of the table-land called by the Balinese\n\n* The title of ratu is always used in addressing princes, but it is only used before the name in speaking of especially distinguished princes. The raja of Tabanan has lately adopted it, and also Sagung-Adi in Pamchutan.\n\n\u2020 Recent experience during the third Dutch expedition does not confirm this assertion, Badong having, as is well known, been defeated.\nbukit, the mountain-range), were immediately under Mengui, to which State also belonged the P'k\u00e9n Badong, a much-frequented place of trade. The founder of the State of Badong was a Gusti of the royal house of Tabanan. In a manuscript which was lent to me, and in which a brief enumeration of the names and marriages of the princes of Badong was written at the end of another work, he was called Gusti Ngrurah Bola; he had settled in Tabanan in the kampong of Buahan (Buah and Jambe mean the betel-nut, pinang), and is therefore called\u2014(1) Anak Agung ring Buahan bumi Tabanan (the prince in or of Buahan in the land of Tabanan); he was the younger son, and sought for a place. From him to the raja Kassiman, who now has the supreme government, there are ten generations, but until we come to the great-grandfather of this man, their history is little more than a list of names).* He went from Tabanan to the P'ken Badong, and lived there in the house of Hi Sedahan, a S\u00fadra (the name S'dah means sirih; this name renders the matter somewhat open to suspicion; was it necessary exactly that the pinang (bush) should come to the sirih?). He thus had no palace, nor does he seem to have had a governorship, nor a fixed residence in Badong, for his son or grandson again comes from Buahan to Badong. His sister married the Gusti Agung, the prince of Mengui, but left no children. The reason of his departure is said to be that he went to seek a governorship in Mengui, an object which his son or grandson seems for the first time to have attained.\n\n2. Anak Agung K'tut Mandesa: this prince, the son or grandson of Ngrurah Bola, went from Buahan, in Tabanan, to the Gunung Batur, the mountain which vomits fire, on which Dewi Danu or Gangga is worshipped. This was evidently a pilgrimage; he did penance on the sacred mountain, in order to obtain earthly power. Thence he came to Badong and lived in the house of the M'kel (B'kel) Tinggi, to the south of the place of cremation of the present Pam'chuttan, in the desa of T'gal. His surname, Mandesa, is said to have been given him because he resided at first in the house of a mandesa (it is possible that he himself was nothing more than a mandesa, a kampong-chief). With the aid of the M'kel Tinggi he soon managed to gain a large number of followers, the result of his penances, and became a Punggawa of Mengui.\n\n3. Anak Agung Pededekan, son of the last mentioned; he also appears to have been a Punggawa.\n\n* The date of a war with Sideman (1582, corresponding with 1660 A.D.) is found in the manuscript of the Wriga Garga, which was lent to me; in that year the men of Karang-Assem (Sideman) with their allies, Mengui, &c., had attacked and invested Badong, but had not conquered it. This is the only historical fact chronologically determined which came to my knowledge in Bali. It appears to have occurred in the time of Gusti Nyoman T'geh.\n4. The three sons of the last are *Gusti Wayahan T'geh*, *Gusti Nyoman T'geh* and *Gusti K'tut K'di*. The second, *Gusti Nyoman T'geh*, is the ancestor of the succeeding princes, and increased the power of the house. He married a woman of noble family (*pramit*) of Buahan. He was brave and cunning, and had a body of picked troops. One of his wife's sisters was married at Klongkong to the Dalem (Deva Agung), and died as a Satya; and the other married in Mengui the Gusti Agung, and became the ancestress of all the Gusti Agungs (princes) of Mengui. These noble alliances and his personal qualities added to his influence, and he seems to have possessed the whole of ancient Badong from Abian-Timbul to Glogor, Pam'chuttan, and Kassiman. It is not certain when the wars with Mengui began, but probably he and his son, and grandson after him, were Punggawas of that State.\n\n5. *Gusti Ngrurah Jambe Mihik* (he is named Jambe, because his mother was from Buahan, or Jambe, in Tabanan).\n\n6. The two sons of the last mentioned, by one mother, are *Anak Agung G'de Galogor* and *Anak Agung T'las ring batu Krotok*. Their mother was from Panataran, a place in the present Pam'chuttan; the Aryas Panataran were at that time still Wesyas, but afterwards they were degraded to Sudras. His wife was also from Panataran, and he seems to have founded Pam'chuttan, or to have made it his residence. *Pam'chuttan* is derived from *p'chut*, an ox-whip; the descent of the race of Pam'chuttan from an ox-driver is found in Abdullah (\"Tijdschrift,\" vii. 2, p. 166 sgg.). It is admitted in Badong that the wife of one of the ancestors was of humble origin, the daughter of an ox-driver, but it does not appear that the wife of Anak Agung T'las ring batu Krotok was of such low birth; had she been so, her son Ngrurah Sakti Pam'chuttan would not have attained such great distinction and power.\n\nAt this time there were princes' capitals in *T'gal*; this is the most ancient, and was founded by the second prince. *T'gal* lies to the south of Pam'chuttan\u2014the principal family, of course, resided here; thence was descended the family in *P'ken Badong*, which had palaces both here and in *Kshatriya*, north of Den Passar. *Galogor*, to the north of Pam'chuttan, was also a capital, founded by the elder brother of Anak Agung T'las ring batu Krotok; the family still exists, and has probably been spared on account of its near relationship with the line of Pam'chuttan. The descendants became Punggawas of Pam'chuttan, and afterwards of Den Passar.\n\n*Pam'chuttan*, finally, the capital of Anak Agung T'las ring batu Krotok, was at that time the seat of the younger line, which, however, was soon to unite the whole of Badong.\n\n7. The sons of *Anak Agung T'las ring batu Krotok* are called *putras*, princes. They are\u2014(a) *Anak Agung ring Pam'chuttan*, also called *Ngrurah Sakti Pam'chuttan*, (b) *Gusti Made T'gal*, (c) *Gusti K'tut T'labah*. Of the last two nothing is known.\nThe first is he who founded the power of Pam\u2019chuttan. He had obtained that great power by means of a creese pussaka,\\(^1\\) called singha\u2014thence his name Sakti (supernatural power). He subjugated the most ancient capital of the princes of Badong in T\u2019gal, and waged successful wars against Mengui, from which he wrested the territory from the present frontier of Mengui to the point of the table-land. He appears to have been the first who was regarded in Badong as an independent prince. He had five hundred wives; the principal ones (prami) were from Tangkeban (Bangli, thus an intermixture with Kshatriyas), Galogor, and Mengui. From this prince are descended eight hundred Gusti Pam\u2019chuttan, who, on account of their near relationship, are regarded as the support and strength of the land. But where brother is ready to fight against brother, such a strength is imaginary. These eight hundred Gustis have a common sanctuary in Pam\u2019chuttan, where they must appear once a month, and in case of absence have to pay a penalty.\n\nBesides Pam\u2019chuttan, the kingdom of the Jambes also existed at that time in P\u2019ken Badong and Kshatriya (the last being merely a country residence of the prince). They also gained distinction by subduing the kingdom of Pinatih, the eastern portion of Badong. They were still of importance at that period, and really of nobler birth than the princes of Pam\u2019chuttan. Galogor had transferred itself to Pam\u2019chuttan as Punggawa.\n\nNgrurah Sakti\u2019s principal sons were:\n\n8. (a) Ngrurah G\u2019d\u00e9 Pam\u2019chuttan, devata di Ukiran (who died in Ukiran); from him are descended the present princes of Pam\u2019chuttan, of whom we shall speak hereafter. (b) Ngrurah Mayun, in the palace of Mayun,\\(^*\\) on the opposite side of the river to the east of Kassiman. This palace no longer exists; all the materials of which it was built have been taken to Den Passar. (c) Ngrurah Kaleran, in the palace of Kaleran; to the north of Pam\u2019chuttan, which position is also indicated by the name kaleran (northern). Little is recorded of these princes; of course they, too, had wars with Mengui and other States, but they have done no prominent acts, and are overshadowed by the fame of their father and their descendants. Pam\u2019chuttan remained and still remains the chief seat of the family; the prince of Pam\u2019chuttan alone can obtain the Abbisheka, that is, can be anointed as prince of the whole realm.\n\n9. The most remarkable of the descendants of the three sons of Ngrurah Sakti was Ngrurah Made Pam\u2019chuttan, the son of Ngrurah Kaleran. This chief married the daughter of Ngrurah Mayun, thereby uniting two portions of the possessions of the Pam\u2019chuttan\n\n\\(^1\\) [Pusaka, an heirloom.]\n\n\\(^*\\) Mayun is the same as Made, \u201cthe middle or second son (or daughter).\u201d This name now no longer exists in Badong; the second prince in the family of Pam\u2019chuttan is called Made.\nfamily, and founded the palace of Kassiman. Not content with this, he attacked the Jambes in P'ken Badong and Kshatriya, and conquered their territory after a severe struggle. He was supported by Pam'chuttan and Gyanyar, whilst the Jambes received aid from Mengui. Great must have been the slaughter in the palace of P'ken Badong\u2014it is spoken of with terror to this day. The fate is also lamented of the murdered Raja Jambe, who, the people say, was entirely blameless, and had given no cause for the war. He had his revenge, however, upon his conqueror, according to the belief of the Balinese, for he was born again in the family of his foe, as his grandson, and the one of noblest birth, a circumstance which was an omen of great misfortune to that family. The conqueror began to build the great palace of Den Passar, but died before it was half finished; he had already taken up his residence, however, in the new palace, and in him began the line of the princes of Den Passar: the palace in Kassiman was still inhabited afterwards by his wife from Mayun, and was finally given up to his second son (according to birth), the still living Raja Kassiman. This prince, for the sake of distinction, is called devata di made, \"died in the middle\"\\(^1\\) (made\u2014the middle\u2014is here Den Passar,\\(^\u2020\\) which, both from the rank of its prince and from its situation, comes between Pam'chuttan and Kassiman). His numerous quarrels with Mengui and nearly all Bali have been without result. Even Tabanan has once fought against him, at the desire of the Deva Agung, and, to save appearances, burnt a single kampong; in reality, however, Tabanan and Gyanyar have always remained friendly to Badong, but they were obliged for political reasons to assume the appearance of hostility against their ally. Badong has neither gained nor lost territory under his rule, while it has become an independent State. The quarrels with the other States were caused chiefly by the aggressions of the Jambes.\n\n10. The sons of this prince, besides many of lower birth, were\u2014(a) Ngrurah Made Pam'chuttan in Den Passar, (b) Ngrurah Kassiman in Kassiman, (c) Ngrurah Jambe, who lives near Den Passar. All three are by different mothers; the first is by a mother from Pam'chuttan, daughter of the Devata di Ukiran (Ngr. G'de Pam'chuttan) and a princess of Tabanan. This prince was younger than the prince of Kassiman, but as he was born of a Raja-woman he took the highest rank among the sons. Kassiman, the old prince who still lives, is the son of a Gusti-woman of Pam'chuttan. Ngrurah Jambe is the son of the daughter of the last prince of Kshatriya, who was forced to marry the conqueror and murderer of her father. By birth he would be more noble than\n\n\\(^{1}\\) [Devata, in the sense of dying (lit. being deified), is only used of princes.]\n\n\\(^{\u2020}\\) Den Passar means, north of the Passar, or, still better, on the further side of the Passar; thus we have also Den Bukit, \"on the further side of the mountains,\" as another name for Boleleng.\nKassiman, and equal to Pam\u2019chuttan, but the descendants of a conquered prince can never again acquire rank in Bali. His noble birth is acknowledged, but he can make no claim to the throne.\n\nThe prince of Den Passar, called after his death devata di Kshatriya, was an ally of Gyanyar and Tabanan. These three began a fresh war against Mengui, which was carried on more by artifice than by force of arms; the Punggawa of Marga, for instance, who at that time was subject to Mengui, being induced to surrender to Tabanan. For fear that he would lose all his territory in this way, the prince of Mengui gave his land in fief to the prince of Den Passar, and remained in possession of Mengui as Punggawa of Badong; he only lost Marga to Tabanan, and Kadewatan, a small piece of territory on the frontier, to Gyanyar. After this arrangement, the four southern States were allied together against Karang-Assem and Boleleng, the old enemies of Badong and Tabanan, whilst Klengkong remained neutral. This state of affairs continued until shortly after the death of the prince of Den Passar, which took place in 1829.\n\nThe prince of Den Passar continued the building of the palace at that place, but did not finish it; we see it now in the state in which he left it. Most of the building materials had to be found by the conquered State of Mengui, where timber was obtained from the mountains, this article being very scarce in Badong. He had several noble wives, but his only son of noble birth, Ngrurah G\u2019d\u00e9 Putra, died a short time before his father. This was the one already mentioned, who was considered to be the last raja Jambe born again, which belief his own father shared. He was regarded as certain to bring misfortune upon the family, and it would seem that he did not die a natural death. In the compact with Mengui, the prince of that land had declared himself a vassal of Ngrurah Made Pam\u2019chuttan and his son Ngrurah G\u2019d\u00e9 Putra. The death of both without a previous renewal of the compact enabled Mengui to regard itself as discharged from its obligations towards Badong, and it soon, in fact, withdrew from them.\n\nAfter the death of Ngrurah Made Pam\u2019chuttan, Kassiman was the only prince of importance of the family of Den Passar, and he thus gained the supremacy in Den Passar and Kassiman. During his brother\u2019s lifetime these two nearly came to blows; Kassiman had already placed his country in a state of defence, but this civil war was prevented by the intervention of Ngrurah G\u2019d\u00e9 Pam\u2019chuttan, the then prince of Pam\u2019chuttan.\n\nThe eldest surviving son of Ngrurah Made Pam\u2019chuttan was Ngrurah G\u2019d\u00e9 Oka. He would have become prince of Den Passar, but he would not acknowledge the supremacy of Kassiman. Kassiman, in conjunction with the prince of Pam\u2019chuttan, compelled him, however, to leave the country, and banished him.\nto Tabanan. This did not prevent him from acting against Kassiman. From Tabanan he went to Mengui, and, both here and in Bangli, gained friends who were willing to support him. To strengthen his party still further, he released Mengui from its vassalage to Badong, under the pretext of being his father's heir, and gave it to the Deva Agung. The latter hastened to make use of this gift, and was able to do so without scruple, because the prince of Mengui had only sworn allegiance in the contract with Badong to the deceased princes Ngrurah Made Pam'chuttan and his son Ngrurah G'de Putra. The Deva Agung then commanded that Ngrurah G'de Oka should be received again in Badong, and this command was obeyed, for this prince had made his appearance with a numerous army from Mengui and Bangli. Ngrurah G'de Oka afterwards carried off Kassiman's only daughter, and took her to wife. Old Kassiman again made use of this to confirm his power over Den Passar: he was now in fact the prince's father. Not long after this marriage, however, Ngrurah G'de Oka died also. The sudden deaths of this prince, his brother, and his father lead us to suspect unnatural means, but I cannot assert, nor would I willingly believe, that they were applied by Kassiman. This old man, it is true, took the best advantage of circumstances, not only in Den Passar, but also in Pam'chuttan, of which we are about to speak. The present prince of Den Passar is Ngrurah Made, who, against his will, acknowledges old prince Kassiman as supreme prince in Badong, but, nevertheless, is independent and endeavouring to increase his power.\n\nPam'chuttan, since the time of Ngrurah Sakti, has been the chief seat of princes in Badong. The family of Den Passar, however, has, by its wars, acquired great fame, and under Kassiman's father and brother has, in fact, held the supreme authority, notwithstanding the nominally higher rank of the prince of Pam'chuttan. We have seen above, that the eldest son of Ngrurah Sakti Pam'chuttan took up his residence in Pam'chuttan. His name was (8) Ngrurah G'de Pam'chuttan devata di Ukiran (Ukiran is a place in Pam'chuttan). He was succeeded by his son (9) Ngrurah G'de Pam'chuttan devata di Munchuk; both were always allied with their more famous relations in Den Passar, and this friendship was maintained by marriages. The last prince of noble birth was (10) Ngrurah G'de Pam'chuttan devata di g'dong; he was anointed,* and played an important part in the wars of Kassiman's father and brother. By command of this prince and Kassiman's brother, his cousin Anak Agung Lanang crossed the sea with an army to\n\n* The anointing of a prince, Abhisheka (Sans.), is performed by the priests (the Guru lokas). In Badong it only takes place at Pam'chuttan. In order to be anointed, the prince must be both of noble birth and instructed in all religious duties. The prince of Pam'chuttan referred to in the text was a Rishi; he had attained the position of a saint by penances (maveda).\nJembrana, and conquered this country, which belonged to Buleleng. Anak Agung Lanang went thither because the prince of Den Passar wished to banish him from Badong. This fact also shows the supremacy of Den Passar at that time. Jembrana was soon lost again, however, and subsequently (11) Anak Agung Lanang (about 1830), after the death of Ngrurah G\u2019d\u00e9 Pam\u2019chuttan, who left no sons, became prince of Pam\u2019chuttan. He was not anointed, but yet enjoyed greater renown than his son, the present prince. He had no sons of noble birth; he only had by a Gun\u1e0dik (concubine) the two sons now called (12) Ngrurah G\u2019d\u00e9 Pam\u2019chuttan and Ngrurah Made Pam\u2019chuttan. These, during their father\u2019s lifetime, were his Parakans, who carried after him his sirih-box, &c. After the death of Anak Agung Lanang, a great portion of the Punggawas of Pam\u2019chuttan would not acknowledge his son as prince, on account of his low birth. Kassiman, however, who in the meantime had also obtained the supreme power in Den Passar, supported the new prince. Some Punggawas (e.g., Deva Made Rahi, in Kutta) submitted, and a Gusti of Legian fled the country and took refuge in Gyanjar. Kassiman then established the new prince in the ancestral palace of Pam\u2019chuttan, and his authority, by marrying him to the daughters of Ngrurah G\u2019d\u00e9 Pam\u2019chuttan, the cousin and predecessor of his father. These women are the principal surviving members of the family, and their illustrious birth enhances that of the prince, who is himself, as it were, his wife\u2019s inferior. His principal wife\u2019s name is Sagung* Adi, another is called Sagung Made, and a third Sagung Oka. Sagung Adi has now assumed the name of Ratu, which we have also seen was done by the prince of Tabanan.\n\nKassiman\u2019s intervention in the affairs of Pam\u2019chuttan gave him the supreme authority in this part of Badong also. He is regarded as the father of the princes of Den Passar and Pam\u2019chuttan, and uses circumstances very cleverly to keep those princes in dependence.\n\nThe prince of Den Passar, Made Ngrurah, and his brothers K\u2019tut Ngrurah and Ngrurah K\u2019tut, were all born of mothers of low extraction, and, had they a brother of higher birth, would not have the least claim to rule. Besides this, K\u2019tut Ngrurah is in opposition to Made Ngrurah, and asserts that he has a better claim than the latter. He has several of the Punggawas on his side, and Made Ngrurah is therefore obliged to invoke the aid of his uncle Kassiman to maintain his position. Kassiman, however, it would seem, does not trust Made Ngrurah, who has inherited much of his father\u2019s ambitious character: he therefore does all he can to uphold the power of Pam\u2019chuttan, and has\n\n* Sagung means a princess, born of a princely father and mother. Sayu, one whose mother was only a Gusti-woman. Sagung is derived from agung, great; Sayu from ayu, good, which we have also found to be a name for the female Brahmans (Idayu).\nenriched the prince of that country and invested him with a certain renown. The prince of Pam'chuttan, therefore, dares not dispute Kassiman's authority; he is of low birth and a peaceful disposition, and would also have to fear the house of Den Passar, which considers itself raised above so low a birth by the deeds of its father and grandfather. The prince of Pam'chuttan has not the abhisheka; although he is a man of about forty-five, he is not yet sufficiently instructed in his duties and in religion; he has performed his duties to the Pitaras, having, with all due ceremony, burnt his father, and built a new domestic temple, which was finished a year ago; yet it appears that he will not receive the abhisheka during Kassiman's lifetime, and, in the event of his death, this would also, perhaps, be prevented by the opposition of Den Passar. The prince of Den Passar has not fulfilled his duties towards his ancestors; his father and brother as well as other chief members of his family are still unburnt, and are preserved in the palace of Den Passar. On this account Made Ngrurah does not reside in the palace.\n\nThis cremation must from the rank of the deceased be very splendid; the prince of Den Passar, however, has not the means to do it, and although, apparently, the whole population of Badong works for him, this produces very little visible result. He has to complete the palace which his father left unfinished, and in which much work has still to be done, and further to improve the roads of his country, which have fallen into a very bad state of repair since the death of his father, the last prince of Pam'chuttan who had the abhisheka. And, finally, he cannot easily raise the funds for a great cremation, and is opposed in his undertakings by K'tut Ngrurah, and, in secret, by Kassiman. In Den Passar also, therefore, it is probable that the position of affairs will remain unchanged till Kassiman's death. Yet another reason against the cremation of the late prince of Den Passar and his son G'de Putra appears to be the above-mentioned superstition, that prince Jambe has been born again in the family of Den Passar in the person of G'de Putra. This second birth indicates misfortune for the family, which fears either that that prince will be born a third time, or that the curse which seems to attach to the family prevents it from performing works pleasing to the gods.\n\n1 [The position of affairs, 35 years later, is thus described by Dr. Jacobs, l. l. p. 168: \"Badung, however small, is divided among three princes, each of whom originally ruled his own portion, and contested the supremacy with the other two, so that we find there three chief cities, Den Passar, Pam'chuttan, and Kasiman. The present Raja Kasiman, though still residing at Kasiman, has deputed his power to the Raja Den Passar, so that actually the latter shares with Rajah Pam'chutan supreme authority. Raja Den Passar exercises sway over the whole of Badung, or is at least looked upon by our government as exercising such sway, while also Pam'chutan is recognized as a ruling prince.\"]\n**Genealogical Table of the Princes of Badong.**\n\n1. **Gusti Ngrurah Bola.**\n2. **Anak Agung K'tut Mandesa.**\n3. **Anak Agung Pajidikan.**\n\n| Gusti Wayahan Tegeh. | (4) **Gusti Nyoman Tegeh,** called Anak Agung di Pule. | Gusti K'tut K'di. |\n|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------|\n|                      | (5) **Gusti Ngrurah Jambe Mihik.**                     |                  |\n\n| Anak Agung G'de Galogor. | (6) **Anak Agung t'las ring batu Krotok,** in Pam'chuttan. |\n|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|\n| The princely family of Galogor. |                                                             |\n\n| (7) **Anak Agung ring Pam'chuttan,** called Ngrurah Sakti Pam'chuttan, with 500 wives. | Gusti Made T'gal. | Gusti K'tut T'labah. |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|---------------------|\n\n| (8) **Ngr.

The others, after one more intermixture with Sudran blood, will sink into the position of ordinary Gustis.\n\n### Further Remarks on the Castes.\n\nThe Dewas, Gustis, and Idas are much too numerous in Bali to maintain their dignity; they, and especially the first two classes, are too proud to gain their livelihood by work, and prefer unjust\nprivileges. They rob the people without limit; they are the cause of the plundering of ships, and of the extortions to which foreign traders are often exposed. The high-caste princes are seldom guilty of such misdeeds, but they wink at the robberies of their relations, and it is difficult to obtain justice from the princes against these pests of the land. The Gustis in the countries ruled by Wesya princes, and the Devas in those where Kshatriyas reign, have properly all the official posts about the prince, but, although they derive much honour from these, they get little pay.\n\nFeudal System.\n\nAs Raffles has observed, the condition of Bali very much resembles that of Europe in the Middle Ages; there is a feudal system throughout the land. The Deva Agung must be regarded as the supreme feudal lord; in ancient times he was so in reality (see \"Usana Java,\" above). How this is modified now, we have already seen. He still calls the other seven princes, and also the prince of Lombok, his Punggawas,* which in Bali conveys the idea of vassal. The rest of the princes (Kshatriyas and Wesyas) have subdivided their land among the members of their families, and so we find in Badong the princes of Kaleran Kawan, Kaleran Kanginan, Ngururah T'gas, the prince of Galogor, and Kassiman's brother with their children as Punggawas of Den Passar (formerly most of them were under Pam'chuttan, but they have preferred to acknowledge as their lords the two warlike princes of Den Passar, Kassiman's father and brother; unless Kassiman had interfered, even the sovereignty over Badong itself would have been transferred from Pam'chuttan to Den Passar). Now they are all under Kassiman, but only in so far as Den Passar also is under his sovereignty. The real Punggawas of Kassiman, in his small original territory, are few in number, and, for the most part, merely the descendants of his brothers, who were entirely without means.\n\nUnder these princes, who are Punggawas of the highest princes and most closely related to the royal families,\u2020 stand the rest of the Gustis, also as Punggawas; these also have an undefined authority over the men whom they rule, and have even the power to punish with death; the prince above them and the prince of the whole kingdom do not trouble themselves about their subjects further than their feudal duties are concerned.\u2021 The Diaksa \u2021\n\n* Punggawa, \"bull\" and \"excellent\" in the Sanskrit.\n\u2020 We do not find many exceptions to this rule; in Tabanan the prince is descended from Marga; in Klungkong, e.g., Ngururah Pinatih, from Arya Bleteng. In Gyanyar from Sukawati.\n\u2021 I write Diaksa instead of Yaksa (as the judges are usually called in Bali and Java), on the authority of a manuscript, where the writing with the second d reveals the origin of the word. Diaksa, which is also found as\nhave merely to pronounce judgment between the \u015a\u00fbdras and sometimes between Gustis of equal rank; in all cases concerning the distinctions of caste and feudal duties the princes and Punggawas are judges; in spiritual matters, however, the Padandas act in this capacity.\n\nThe primary feudal duty, as in the Middle Ages, is service in war; and further, the Punggawas and their subordinates have to furnish assistance in all public works and festivals of the prince, and the lower orders also have to carry out all the works of the Punggawas. The people, under the guidance of the Punggawas, have to build the princes' palaces and places of cremation, to repair the roads, and besides this to contribute, mostly in kind, towards the expenses of all offerings, family feasts, and cremations. The direct taxes are very unimportant; the common man pays a small tax on garden land, and a little more on sawahs. The princes, therefore, cannot be rich, unless they possess considerable private means; they are powerful, however, so long as their names hold the Punggawas in subjection, and they can therefore celebrate their splendid feasts and cremations without cost to themselves, and sometimes even with advantage to their private treasuries, their faithful vassals zealously contributing to these ceremonies. (One of the reasons why the great cremation in Den Passar does not take place is, that the present prince is not in very high esteem with the Punggawas, and that not enough is contributed towards it. Besides this, Kassiman retains the revenue.) To the revenues of the princes and the Punggawas belong also the duties on commerce, the customs-duties, and the bridge or road-tolls.* Trade especially produces a considerable revenue for the prince, and has made the princes of Badong comparatively rich, above all Pam'chuttan and Kassiman. Karang-Assem also makes a great deal by it. These imposts affect only the lower orders, and the Chinese, Buginese, and Europeans. The Gustis, Devas, and Idas who carry on trade pay no duty upon it. The feudal lords, princes, and Punggawas still do something for the people\u2014they give them water, and the making of canals and the effective irrigation of the rice-fields are their duty; in return for this, however, they draw a small revenue from the rice-growers.\n\nAdiaksa in the MSS., is Skt.\u2014adhi and aksha, an inspector, protector (see Wilson). Yaksa, on the contrary, is a sort of demon, allied to the R\u00e2ksasas. [See Roorda's \"Javanese Dictionary,\" s.v. jaksha, where the etymology from adhyaksha is correctly given.]\n\n* I am only acquainted, however, with two bridges in Bali (excepting those over small brooks) in any way worthy of the name\u2014one at Kutta, built by Europeans with Balinese aid, and one, very dangerous for want of planks, over a rocky chasm in Tabanan.\nThe fourth caste, the S\u00fbdras, have many duties and hardly any rights, at any rate as regards the higher castes. Their subjection goes so far that the prince or Punggawa can take out of their houses whatever he likes; when the prince goes from one place to another, the victuals, fowls, ducks, geese, &c., are usually taken by the Parakans (followers of the prince) from the houses of the S\u00fbdras in the dessas through which the route lies, and the persons thus robbed may not even complain. The prince or Punggawa can even take away the wives of a S\u00fbdra, but religious feeling is opposed to this, and still more to the murder of a S\u00fbdra, who has committed no fault, by a noble. Both acts are done, however, although they are of rare occurrence, in Badong. The wanton young Gustis and Devas think that they prove their valour and noble birth by the abduction of women and the murder of innocent beasts of burden, such as the S\u00fbdras are. In Badong, old Kassiman suppressed such deeds, and the fear of punishment after death also has a deterrent effect.* Nevertheless the position of the S\u00fbdras is most miserable, and only rendered supportable by their courage and industry, and by the belief that they are born to it. An exception to the rest of the S\u00fbdras is formed by the Parakans (the followers of the princes, &c.); these lead as idle a life as the princes and Punggawas to whom they belong, and plunder the rest of the people. These and the nobles are the chief cock-fighters and opium-smokers, for the inhabitants of the dessas take little part in these dissipations. Another exception to the lot of the ordinary S\u00fbdras is formed by the Mandesas, Prab'kels, and others, who occupy official posts.\n\nMandesas are the dessa-chiefs; they have been degraded to S\u00fbdras by the Deva Agung, having been Wesyas by birth. Under them are the Kabayan, Nguhukin, and Talikup, S\u00fbdras by birth, who carry out the orders of the Mandesas.\n\nGaduh are the Mandurs in the dessas; they are S\u00fbdras by birth. Dangka and Batu-Aji are under these.\n\nPasek are also Wesyas who have been degraded to S\u00fbdras, and still retain a certain superiority of rank above the rest of the populace.\n\nWe find all these names in the \"Usana Bali\" (see p. 262), where their special religion is mentioned (the \"Usana Bali,\" as we have seen, is only of importance to the S\u00fbdras and their chiefs of the same caste).\n\n* Balinese superstition regards the fate of the first Deva Mangis, the founder of Gyanyar, and that of the wife of the last Deva Agung, the much-feared princess of Karang-Assem, as examples of such punishments; the former was changed into a serpent (n\u00e2ga), and the latter into a frog (dongkang). Both had murdered many victims.\nThe names are not heard in ordinary life, with the exception of Mandesa. For all the rest the collective name Prab'kel (the collective B'kels) is used. These have a certain number of common Sudras under them at the prince's disposal, to serve in war or on public works, and also to exercise handicrafts (as smiths, &c.). They are responsible for the presence and the work of their subordinates, just as the Mandesa is responsible for his dessa. Prab'kel or Pam'kel, also M'kel, has become a title for every superior among the Sudras\u2014the owner is the M'kel of the slave, the husband the M'kel of the wife. This exalted rank is also accorded to Europeans, but they stand below the three principal castes; they have not been born twice (dvija).\n\nThe Balinese Sudras are partly of Javan and partly of Balinese origin. The former celebrate the new year (Sugian) six days before the Balinese new year (Galungan). The latter, however, is taken as the beginning of the calendar by the whole people.\n\nIn addition to the above, degraded Brahmans, Kshatriyas, and Wesyas also belong to the Sudras. The original Wesyas, those who came from Majapahit, have all become Sudras, and this at the same time that the descendants of Arya Damar were degraded to Wesyas. The reason given for this does not agree with that of the degradation of the Kshatriyas. All castes, indeed, are said to have descended a step, excepting the original Brahmans. The descendants of Batu Henggong, the Deva Agungs, who, on account of their procreation by the Padanda Dang hyang Kapakisan, were also regarded as Brahmans, sank back, through the curse or the anger of the Padanda who produced the Naga from the well (see as to the Nagabandha, under Cremations), to true Kshatriyas, and the consequence of this was the degradation of the other Kshatriyas to Wesyas, and of the Wesyas to Sudras. This explanation is open to great doubt. Most of the descendants of the Aryas, the brothers of Arya Damar, have been degraded to Sudras. They were degraded, as we have seen, to Wesyas, but when they had also lost their governorships and their authority, oppressed by the descendants of Patih Gaja Maja (the royal race of Mengui-Karang-Assem), they gradually sank to the rank of Sudras. Many of them are still called Gustis by the people, but they have to give their services as vassals to the princes in whose territory they live, and no longer enjoy any honour. The conquered are always despised and degraded in Bali. Brahmans are also degraded to Sudras if, on account of frequent intermixture with Sudra blood, they are no longer considered capable of retaining their dignity. An instance of a Padanda being thus degraded is actually mentioned. Brahmans do, indeed, become Sudras, but the people hold the caste in such great respect that they are still regarded and honoured as Brahmans. Brahmana chute are mentioned in the \"Usana Java;\" the Balinese explain these to be lying and\nthieving Brahmans, who, on account of their conduct, have sunk to the rank of \u015a\u016bdras. *Chute* is, indeed, in Sanskrit, *chyula*, \"fallen.\"\n\n*Sangguhu* is a subdivision of the \u015a\u016bdras, who are acquainted with the Vedas, and perform the ceremony of domestic worship, as well as the priests. If they have, indeed, the Vedas (they may be only *Mantras*, formulas), it would seem that they were originally Brahmans. Now, we find in the \"Usana Java\" a statement that the Sangguhus are, in fact, descended from Br\u0101hma\u1e47a-Br\u0101hma\u1e47i, and thus are pure Brahmans, and that they were degraded on account of the worship of the *Dalem mur*, that is, the god of death (perhaps as indicating an exclusive K\u0101la-worship, which no longer exists in Bali). We have therefore had in Bali departures from the worship of the gods, not to say sects. The present Brahmans, who have suppressed the sect referred to, now tell us, to conceal the existence of any other worship but their own, that the Sangguhus are descended from a *parakan* (follower) of a learned Padanda, who was hidden under the Bale whenever the Padanda performed his domestic worship, and so came to understand the Vedas. When he was discovered, the Padanda set him at liberty, that he might perform the Veda-worship for himself and his descendants. From him are descended the Sangguh or Sangguhu, which word is explained by means of *kira*: having the appearance of being Brahmans. There is some number of them in Bali.\n\n*Byagaha* are also mentioned in the \"Usana Java\" as a distinct class, and these appear to be of the same rank as the Sangguhu. The name, however, is almost unknown, even to the Panditas. Thus in the three classes of Sudras last mentioned, we find also no mixture of caste; but they all three point to the former existence of sects, or at least to some departures from the orthodox religion.\n\nIt would be a fortunate thing for the \u015a\u016bdras to be freed from the oppression of the princes and Punggawas. The number of noble idlers increases every day, and presses more and more heavily upon the poor \u015a\u016bdra populace. One means of escaping from the oppression of a prince is to flee to another State, but even this avails them little, for the prince of the State in which the fugitive seeks refuge immediately imposes upon him the very burdens from which he has fled. Besides this, a fugitive who arrives without his family is sold by the prince, in order to make some profit out of him, and to prevent his escaping again to another country. The best asylum is generally afforded by the Padandas; the prince has no right to fugitives who seek refuge with them, and there are several kind-hearted really pious men among these Padandas who consider it shameful to sell a person seeking an asylum, or even to require much work from him. Many Padandas, however, are also genuine natives, and avail\nthemselves of these cases to enrich themselves. The chief curb upon the despotism of the noble castes over the \u015a\u016bdras is, in fact, the fear lest they should run away, and the power and revenues of the nobles should thereby be diminished. The Balinese, however, are unusually attached to their country and their dessa; ordinary extortion does not drive them to flight; it is generally only some glaring cruelty or the fear of being sold out of Bali that induces them to escape. Still, the fact that there are always many fugitives in Bali shows the injustice and cruelty of most of the princes, and the degeneration of the system of caste. In Badong there are very many fugitives from Gyanyar, Mengui, Klonkong, and Karang-Assem; on the other hand, scarcely any fugitives from Badong are to be found in the other states. The reason of this is, that the government in this state is comparatively mild and humane, and this is attributable to Kassiman's higher intelligence and his contact with Europeans. For the sake of humanity it is desirable that intercourse between Europeans and the Balinese should increase, and that the position of the \u015a\u016bdras should thus be improved, at any rate a little, if they could not be entirely freed from their oppressors. The character of the Balinese as a people, irrespectively of their castes, has been very accurately perceived by Raffles: they are a manly nation, both in body and mind, far superior to the Javanese (although outwardly less civilized), and endowed with many virtues which in Java have disappeared beneath the mire of immorality and fickleness. The Balinese (excepting those who carry on trade and are corrupted by undue gains) are faithful and honest and can work hard; it is only for their prince that they work reluctantly, for they receive from him neither payment nor food; and, finally, they are braver than all other natives, but against the European they are as incapable of resistance as all the descendants of the black Adam, and the defiant language employed to Europeans comes from a timid heart. The European is as a tiger to all natives, and they know him by instinct.\n\nCaste in Java.\n\nThe existence of caste in Java has hitherto been denied, but what we now know of Bali appears to have placed it beyond doubt. That all the institutions of the Balinese are of Javan origin is affirmed by the manuscripts and the oral tradition of the people. The \"Usana Java\" enumerates Kshatriyas of Koripan (where Panji lived), of Gaglang or Singhasari, of Kediri or Daha, and of Janggala. In all the great kingdoms of Java, therefore, Kshatriyas existed. The descent of the Kshatriyas of Daha is traced in the Brahmanda-pur\u00e2na to the Muni Pulaha. In the same work the Brahmans are divided into Siva-Brahmans, Buddha-\nBrahmans, and Bujangga-Brahmans (thus the Brahmans in Java were exactly like those now in Bali); these are sons of Br\u0101hma\u1e47a Haji, that is to say, the various forms of worship are derived from Haji \u015aaka, the founder of the Indo-Javanese calendar. Bujangga seems in ancient times to have been a distinct sect. We have spoken of the present meaning of this word; it seems formerly to have meant a particular kind of worship, in contradistinction to \u015aiva and Buddha.* The Wesyas are also mentioned in the \"Usana Java\" as existing in Java; to these belong the Patihs, D'mangs, and Tumenggungs. The names Wesya and Gusti (see \"Tijdsch. v. N. I.\" 7, 2, 185) still exist in Java, although their meaning has become obscure. The S\u016bdras are expressly mentioned, and their name also is still heard in Java.\n\nIn the \"Usana Java\" (which really only relates to Java) the Brahmans spring from Brahm\u0101's \u015aivadara, the opening in the head which in children does not close for some years, the Kshatriyas from his breast, the Wesyas from his abdomen, and the S\u016bdras from his knee.\n\nThe nobles of the courts of Daha and Majapahit, according to express testimony, were Kshatriyas and Wesyas. To the Kshatriyas belong all those who bear the title of Arya, K'bo, or Mahisa and Rangga. The titles of the Wesyas have just been given.\n\nThe appearance of caste and the existence of the Vedas in Bali afford the strongest evidence for the existence of both in ancient Java, because all that we find in Bali was derived from Java alone, not a single fact discovered in Bali proving, or even indicating, direct communication between this island and India, and because the \u015aiva Brahmans, who, after having established themselves for a short time at Majapahit, crossed over to Bali, came, according to the Balinese, not direct from India, but from the interior of Java (Kediri). The real origin of all the Balinese institutions is also shown by the fact that we find nothing to remind us directly of India, and no ancient writing, Sanskrit, Kavi, or Javanese: we may well ask how could emigrants from India have so neglected and forgotten their own writing and language, and have merely preserved the modern Javanese writing and the Kavi tongue?\n\n* The word Bujangga means a serpent; in India the serpent-worship has been adopted in the Brahmanical doctrine; we find it especially in Cas'mira; serpent-worship is still found in Java and Bali (Vasuki), and the Bujanggas appear to have originally been serpent-worshippers, who afterwards joined the Sivaitic sect.\nThe Calculation of Time in Bali.\n\nThe calculation of time is of two kinds: the Indian and the Balinese. All that we know of it is contained in a work called *Wriga Garga.* This work is composed of Indian and Polynesian elements, and, like the rest of the literature, must be of Javanese origin, as in that island alone do we find an almost identical calendar.\n\nWe have an Indian division of time, according to the lunar months. These months, however, are transformed by interpolation, into the solar year, and the solar years are calculated from the time of *Salivahana* or *\u015aaka*, as is also the practice in the greater part of Hindustan and of the Dekkan. This calendar begins on the 14th of March, 78 B.C. This calculation, however, is but little used by the Balinese, and their scanty astronomical knowledge renders it extremely difficult, although, for the sake of agriculture and a few feasts, it must be preserved. The interpolation is irregular; in India two months are introduced in five years, but in Bali, on the one hand, the month of *K\u0101rtika* may comprise two months, and, on the other, the month of *Asada* may last till the constellation of the Pleiades (*K\u1e5bttika*) is visible at sunset. The only constellations used by the Balinese in such calculations are the Pleiades and Orion. The latter is called *Waluku*, the plough, and also by the Indian name *l\u0101nggala* (in Malay *tangala*). They understand by this, however, only the three centre stars of Orion. To supplement this defective means of calculating the year, the Balinese observe certain natural phenomena occurring regularly every year at the same time, such as the blossoming of certain flowers and plants and the appearance of wings on the white ant, and also the phenomena of the sea. A man of rank informed me that the interpolation of a month had only happened three times in his life. This would give an interval of about twelve years between each interpolation; it is more probable that an interpolation is made every ten years, hence the name *tenggek* for such a division. At present the Balinese lunar months are rather more than thirty days in advance of the Indian, as fixed by Wilson. The year begins with the month of *Kasanga*; the Indian name for this is *Chetra*, and commences, according to Wilson, in March. This, then, proves that the Balinese years do indeed start from the exact date of \u015aaka (14th of March), and Raffles\u2019 and Crawfurd\u2019s conjectures as\n\n---\n\n*Garga*, according to Wilson, is one of the ten Munis or saints; one Garga is also the author of astronomical works in India; see Bentley, \u201cHindu Astronomy,\u201d p. 54; his book is named Sanhita; he lived 550 years B.C. [See, however, Kern, in the Introduction to his edition of \u201cVar\u0101ka-Mihira\u2019s Brihat-sanhita,\u201d p. 31 ff.] The Balinese Calendar, as it is, cannot be derived from him, because it contains elements never known in India.\nto the difference of the calendar in Java and Bali can be solved by assuming that the Balinese have retained the ancient and true calendar, whilst the Javanese, through Muhammadan influence, have forgotten how to calculate the solar year, and have, therefore, got seven or eight years further from \u015aaka than they should be.\n\nAll the months but two (Jyesht\u0101 and Asa\u1e0da) have both Sanskrit and Balinese names.\n\nThe Sanskrit names are:\n\n1. \u015ar\u0101vana.\n2. Bh\u0101dra or B\u0101drawada (Sanskrit Bh\u0101drapada).\n3. Asuji or Asuje (derived from Asvayuj).\n4. K\u0101rtika.\n5. M\u0101rgas\u012brsha or M\u0101rgas\u012brshya.\n\nThe Balinese names for the first ten are the ordinal numbers from 1 to 10:\n\n1. Kasa.\n2. Karo.\n3. Katiga.\n4. Kapat.\n5. Kalima.\n6. Kanam.\n7. Kapita.\n8. Kahulu.\n9. Kasanga.\n10. Kadas'a.\n\nWe have no Balinese names for Jyesht\u0101 and Ashadha (vulgo Sada), and this leads us to suspect that the original Balinese-Javanese year, like that of the ancient Romans, had only 10 months. Now we find in the purely Balinese calendar, of which we shall speak shortly, divisions of 35 days or 5 weeks, which, it is true, do not now possess a special name, but no doubt originally corresponded with the 10 months; 10 times 35 gives about the duration of the year of lunar months, 354 days. The addition of Jyesht\u0101 and Ashadha, then, occurred at a later period, when Indian influence had led to the division of the year into 12 months, each of 29 or 30 days.\n\nIn the year 1847 the first day of the month Kasanga or Chetra was on the 16th of February; in 1848 on the 5th of February; in 1849 it will fall on the 24th of January. In 1844, on the contrary, it was on the 24th of March, almost on the day on which, according to Wilson, the Indian month Chetra should begin. Although in Bali, from ignorance of the calculations, the method of fixing the solar year is obscure, and is known but imperfectly to a few learned priests (who themselves cannot properly explain the reasons for it), yet we learn from the tables called Pengalihan wulan (the searching of the moon) how the time of the Balinese calculation is brought into accordance with that of the lunar months: 64 lunar months, of which 30 are of 29 and 34 of 30 days, give us 1890 days, which agree with 9 Balinese years of 210 days.\n\nAccording to the Indian calculation, there should be one or two intercalary months next year (1849), because then the\ndifference between the solar and the lunar year will be from the 24th of January to the 20th of March, and will thus amount to 55 days; nothing, however, has yet been said to me of any such intention. In India, as we have already pointed out, there are 2 intercalary months every 5 years called Malimlucha; this name is unknown in Bali, nor have I heard any name which could correspond to it.\n\nThe six Indian seasons do not exist in Bali. The lunar months are chiefly important for fixing certain feasts. For all other dates use is made solely of\n\n**The Balinese Calendar.**\n\nThis is formed by a combination of the Polynesian week of 5 days (pahing, puan, wage, kaliwon, manis) with the Indian week of 7 days (Rediti,* Soma, Anggara, Budd'a, Vrihaspti, \u0160ukra, Sane\u0161chara); this combination gives us 35 days, which form the basis of the Balinese calendar; we write them thus:\n\n| Budda kaliwon, | Soma pahing, | Sanes'chara wage, |\n|----------------|--------------|------------------|\n| Wrihaspati manis, | Anggara puan, | Rediti kaliwon, |\n| Sukra pahing, | Budda wage, | Soma manis, |\n| Sane\u0161chara puan, | Wrihaspati Kaliwon, | Anggara pahing, |\n| Rediti wage, | Sukra manis, | Budda puan, |\n| Soma kaliwon, | Sanes'chara pahing, | Wrihaspati wage, |\n| Anggara manis, | Rediti puan, | Sukra kaliwon, |\n| Budda pahing, | Soma wage, | Sane\u0161chara manis, |\n| Wrihaspati puan, | Anggara kaliwon, | Rediti pahing, |\n| Sukra wage, | Budda manis, | Soma puan, |\n| Sane\u0161chara kaliwon, | Wrihaspati pahing, | Anggara wage. |\n| Rediti manis, | Sukra puan, | |\n\nWe find these combinations of 35 days six times in each Balinese year of 210 days, but they are not called months. On the other hand, each of the 30 weeks has its own name. We find these names in Raffles, vol. i. p. 476. The order of sequence is the same in Bali, but some names must be corrected. Each division begins with Budda kaliwon, the day on which Galungan, the Balinese new year, falls, and not on Rediti (or Diti) Pahing, as Raffles asserts. The week in which the year begins is Dunghulan; Sinta, however, is always named as the first week in Bali, as in Java; the names are:\n\n* The name Rediti can only be explained by Adiya, \"sun.\" The substitution of ri for d may well have arisen by the uncommon initial a having been taken for the sign r\u0113, which is very well known. Vrihaspati is found in good MSS. for Respati, which is the ordinary pronunciation. [Van der Tuuk, \"Notes on Kawi,\" p. 9.

In Bali this division, like the rest of the calendar, is said to be derived from India. Its introduction was no doubt made by the priests at an early period, in order to add to the sanctity of the religious feasts and institutions, which are regulated according to this calendar.*\n\nOf the 35 days the first, eleventh, and twenty-first (Budda kaliwon, Sane\u015bchara kaliwon and Anggara kaliwon) are sacred. Here again, therefore, the decimal system prevails. In the first five weeks, the feast of Galungan, the new year, falls on Budda kaliwon, the feast of Kuningan (in Crawfurd Galunan and Kuninan) on Sane\u015bchara kaliwon, and finally the feast in the principal temple of Uluwatu in Badong on Anggara kaliwon.\n\nSome Balinese only call this year of 210 days a half-year. It is indeed, however, their civil year, and they are only disposed to regard it as a half-year to make it agree with the Muhammadan, Chinese, and European year.\n\nEach of these 35 days has a constellation, which indicates its good or evil qualities, and is of special importance for nativities; these constellations are not the same, however, as our own, or even as the Indian, for, with the exception of the Waluku (Orion) and the Krittika (the Pleiades), the signs are somewhat arbitrary.\n\n**ASTROLOGICAL CALENDAR.**\n\nThese constellations, which decide the good or evil fortune of the day, are called lintangan (lintang = bintang, \"star\"). They are supposed to pass into the body of people born on that day.\n\nRediti manis has the Ancha-ancha, a human figure standing on\n\n* Sapta Resi (the seven ancient saints, sages) are said to have prepared it. The pengalihan bulan, also, in which the lunar calendar is brought into agreement with that of thirty weeks, is attributed to the same persons.\nits head and hands.

Much misfortune. Repeated illness.\n\nThere is not much astronomical science in all this, and many of the ideas are really ridiculous, yet the Balinese attach value to them, and those who are born on a day with a good constellation often boast of it.\n\nIn addition to these astrological meanings of the 35 days, there are for each of the seven days of the week: (1) a god, who presides over it; (2) a human figure, indicating the character of the person; (3) a tree; (4) a bird; (5) a buta (demon); (6) a satwa (beast). The nature of these is supposed to indicate what the character of the person born on that day will be.\n\nThe seven gods are given, following the order of the days of the week, beginning with Sunday, as follows: Indra, Um\u0101, Brahm\u0101, Vishnu, Guru, Sri, Yama; or, according to another account, Indra, Pritiwi, Vishnu, Brahm\u0101, Guru, Um\u0101, Durg\u0101. The seven Butas are: Hulu asu (dog's head), Hulu k'bo (buffalo's head), Hulu kuda (horse's head), Hulu lembu (cow's head), Hulu singha (lion's head), Hulu gaja (elephant's head), Hulu gagak (crow's head). From these the man obtains his passions, and from the beasts his lower qualities.\n\nAccording to the astrological notions of the Balinese, the day is divided into five parts, each of which has a separate name, although they occur in different order on different days. Raffles also mentions a division of the day into five parts in Java; but in\nBali we have different names and rules for this division. The principal part is called *Myita* (Amrita); he who is born at this time of day is certain to have good fortune. The five parts of the days undergo twelve changes, and to know their order on a particular day, the number of the day of the Indian week is added to that of the day of the Polynesian week, and the result is one of the twelve combinations of the five parts of the day (and also of the night). The rest of the divisions (besides *Myita*) are *sunya* (empty, poor), *kala* (passionate; after the god K\u00e2la), *pati* (must die), *linyok* (will become bad and thievish). The day is further divided, in a civil aspect, into eight hours, *dadauhan*, calculated from sunrise to sunset (their names are *dauh pisan*, stroke one, *dauh ro*, *dauh tiga* or *telu*, &c.). The night is also divided into eight parts in the same manner. To find the hour a sort of water-clock (clepsydra) is used, consisting of a clapper with a little hole in its bottom which rests on the water. As soon as the clapper is filled it is emptied by an attendant, and the number of strokes are given at the same time upon a drum. Contrivances of this kind are to be found in the principal palaces\u2014*e.g.*, in Den Passar (in Badong), Mengui, &c.\n\nThe lunar month is divided into the white and the black half, *sukla-paksha* and *krishna-paksha* (literally, the white and black wing), as is the case in India. The days of the white half are called *tanggal*, and are reckoned from new to full moon; those of the black half are called *panluang*. To describe a date, the Balinese give the day of the week (of the Indian week of seven days as well as of the Polynesian of five), the name of the week (according to the Balinese division of 30 weeks), the name and the half of the lunar month (white or black), the day of that half, and finally the year, calculated from Saka. Instead of the year of Saka, they also give simply the year of the century, the century itself being understood. The century is divided into 10 divisions, each of 10 years; each such division is called *tenggek*, each single year *rah*. Thus we have, for instance, on the 26th of June, 1847, *Saneschara* (Saturday) *kaliwon* (according to the Polynesian week) *wara Landap* (in the week of Landap) *masa kasa* (in the month of Kasa) *sukla paksha* (in the white half; also simply *tanggal*, with a waxing moon) *ping* 13 (on the thirteenth day) *rah* 9, *tenggek* 6 (thus 69). Adding to this the century (1700), we get the year of Saka 1769, to which 78 must be added to arrive at the year of our Lord (1847).\n\nBesides the *Wriga garga*, which, as we have said, is entirely of Indian origin, there are two other works upon the calendar, which, however, are no longer used; their titles are Sundari* trus and\n\n* The name Sundari is Sanskrit, and means \"the fair one.\" Trus and bungka are Polynesian additions; the former seems to indicate that it contains a continuous calendar.\nSundari bungka. As I have not yet been able to get a sight of them, I cannot say much about them. The Pandita in Taman said that these works are more recent than the Wriga Garga, and were composed in Java, whereas the Wriga Garga was composed in India (Kling). They were used formerly, but the Balinese priests have given the preference to the older Wriga Garga. This also is an instance of their adherence to all that is ancient and, in their opinion, of Indian origin. The Wriga Garga appears to date from the time of the kingdom of Daha (Kediri), whence our priests are descended, and which kingdom, as we have seen, they often confound with India and call Baratawarsa.\n\nWe have enumerated in the \"Tijdsch. van N. I.,\" Jaargang VIII. iv. 211, still further divisions of time, namely, a divivara, trivara, chaturvara, shadvara, astavara, sangavara, and dasavara, besides the saptavara and panchavara; all these are less prominent in ordinary life. The trivara serves to indicate the market days, as the Panchavara does in Java; there is a market every third day (Dvara).\n\nThe shadvara is often found in dates added to the saptavara and panchavara. The names of the shadvara are Polynesian: Tunggleh, Haryang, Wurukung, Paniron, Was, Mahulu. Thus the first day of the week Sinta is Tunggleh Pahing Rediti, the second Haryang Puan Soma, the third Wurukung Wage anggara, the fourth Paniron Kaluwon Budda, the fifth Was Manis Wrehaspati, the sixth Mahulu Pahing Sukra, the seventh Tunggleh Puan Saneshara. The remaining divisions are chiefly used for astrological definitions. I have not yet discovered clearly how the astavara are brought into accordance with the tutelar deities attributed to each of the seven days of the week (see above). The names of the gods of the Astavara are: Sri, Indra, Guru, Yama, Rudra, Brahma, Kala, Uma; the tutelar gods of the seven weekdays are: Indra, Uma, Brahma, Wishnu, Guru, Sri, Yama, or, according to the other account, Indra, Pritiwi, Wishnu, Brahma, Guru, Uma, Durga.\n\nThe zodiac (rasi) is also used for astrological purposes. We have given the names in the \"Tijds. v. N. I.,\" Jaargang VIII., iv. 211. In good MSS. we find them written still better according to the Sanskrit. The signs of the zodiac, which I found drawn in a manuscript, are the Indian ones; there is no aquarius, but only the water-pitcher (kumba), and instead of the ram there is a shrimp (udang=makara). Mrechika is Skrt. Vri\u015bchika, the scorpion. Rakata should be Karkata. What is most remarkable is, however, the absence of the tul\u0101 (scales) in the manuscript referred to. This could not be an accidental omission, for the claws of the scorpion stretch over the place where the tul\u0101 ought to have been, and the scorpion thus took up the room of two signs. Now it is\nwell known that the Greeks in ancient times had only eleven signs of the zodiac, and that it was precisely the scales which were absent, and also that it is supposed that the scales originated out of the claws of the scorpion; although it is not certain whether a sign was lost in the course of transmission from the East (or from Egypt), or whether there were only eleven originally. The discovery of a zodiac with eleven signs in India now renders this question still more intricate. This zodiac cannot have come from the West, for the entirely Indian character of our zodiac excludes this theory; we must therefore suppose that in India also the zodiac once had but eleven signs, and that it was not till later times that the scales were added both in India and in Greece. In Bali all twelve signs are given by name, and thus here also a twelfth has been added; but the fact that we found in Bali the drawing referred to proves that at the time of the first intercourse between India and Java the zodiac still had but eleven signs in the former country. It is not known whether a similar zodiac has been found in India, but it would be of the highest importance to obtain further information from there on this point, and if possible to determine the age of such representations, which would furnish a date of the utmost importance both for the history of astronomy and for that of civilization in Java.\n\nThe eclipses of the sun and moon are explained in Bali, as in India, as the devouring of these bodies by a demon (Rahu); the eclipses of the sun are called graha and those of the moon rahu, which in India, however, is no distinction, as the former means the act of devouring and the latter the devouring demon. To help the moon on these occasions, the Balinese make a terrible noise with their rice-blocks and other instruments, as they do on the eve of Galungan and of the fast-days (nyepi), when the evil spirits are driven away by noise. The Panditas know that Europeans predict the eclipses of the sun and moon, and questioned me about it; they themselves, however, are ignorant of the method of calculation. They also keep this knowledge secret from the people, as the following instance will show. A European, Mr. M., lived some time in Tabanan, and was very intimate with the young prince. On the approach of an eclipse of the moon, he predicted its occurrence to the prince, who was very pleased thereat, but was compelled by his priests to banish the European from his country, for since the European knew more than the priests, it necessarily followed that he was possessed of an evil spirit from which he obtained his knowledge. Had the European first told it to the priests, they would not have driven him from the country, but would have displayed their knowledge to the people.\n\nAs I do not possess a MS. of the Wriga Garga, I cannot give here any further information as to the astronomical and astrological\nscience of the Balinese, although it is most worthy of attention. The greater portion of the people are still utterly ignorant of the calendar. Even among the priests this science is only retained mechanically; but what knowledge they have they use especially to make the people dependent upon them. Every important undertaking requires the help of the priest as the mediator with the deity, and as astronomer and astrologer.\n\nXI.\n\nNOTICES ON ZOOLOGICAL SUBJECTS.\n\nBy Messrs. Diard and Duvaucel,\n\nNaturalists employed under the authority of the Lieut. Governor of Bencoolen.\u00b9\n\n[Translated from \"Malayan Miscellanies\" (Bencoolen, 1821), vol. i. No. 9.]\n\nNOTICE ON THE PANGOLING ANT-EATER OF THE EAST INDIES.\n\nThe forms and proportions of certain animals appear to harmonize so little with their habits, that one may, so to speak, be pardoned for considering them as the accidental sports of organization, escaped from the hands of Nature and betraying, by the heteroclitic contrasts of their structure and their course of life, the imperfection of their original outline.\n\nWhen one sees, for example, such large and strong quadrupeds as the tamandua, sharing a mode of living with the birds which appears unworthy of the most miserable quadruped, can we help being shocked at the part which has been theirs, and looking upon an animal more than four feet in length, feeding solely upon ants, otherwise than as a monster in creation, or at least, as a creature ridiculously degraded by the insectivorous regimen to which it has been subjected?\n\nIn vain would one search in the necessity with which, for example, the tamandua in burrowing and digging out the earth, often at great depths, to get at its prey, for a sufficient reason for excusing\n\n\u00b9 [Concerning these gentlemen, see the \"Memoir of the Life and Public Services of Sir T. S. Raffles\" (London, 1830), pp. 372 and 703 ff.; and more especially vol. xiii. of the \"Transactions of the Linnean Society,\" pp. 239, 240.]\nits large body; one would be forced to put aside this explanation, since other very small species of the same class execute absolutely the same manoeuvres, and do not in the least appear to need an enormous force to declare war against a colony of ants. One must therefore return to the belief that Nature has not always realized, even in the most perfect relationships, that this animal must make an exception to the harmonic rules which we admire in the greatest part of its productions.\n\nWhen we say that Nature in creating certain animals did not quite conceive of them in the highest sense, we are told that absolute analogy was not reckoned among their organic and instinctive faculties. Certainly, if it pleased Nature sometimes to omit placing things in harmony in some of her works, it can never have been at the expense of the creatures she has created. Whether we recognize or not some anomalous quadruped, with a mouth, without the sign of teeth, and only provided with a tongue like a bird's, protractile and almost filiform, it nevertheless still belongs to the class of the most wonderful animals, and to those most worthy of the researches and investigations of naturalists.\n\nThere are five or six species of ant-eaters to be found in America, one of which, as we have said before, has an enormous body, considering its insectivorous habits; but in the Eastern hemisphere only two species have been found as yet, one in Africa and the other in Asia: anatomically speaking, these species are exactly the same as those in America, but differing completely in the scale-like armour which covers the whole of their body. These animals, which have been transported into Europe several times, have been seen and described by naturalists who call them generically Manis, and who distinguish them by the special names of brachyura and macrura. The macrura is the phatagin of Buffon, the brachyura is his Pangoling, which he had all reason to call it, as the word Pangoling really means in Malay an animal that rolls itself up, and is one of the true names of the Manis in this country. To complete this descriptive word, the Malays generally say Pangoling sisik, the scaled animal that rolls itself up; nevertheless, it is well to observe, that along the west coast of Sumatra, the Manis is not called Pangoling, but Pangilling;\u00b9 the Malays want to express by this the faculty which this animal has for climbing; this is what we cannot decide.\n\nAlthough the Pangolings are not very rare animals, nevertheless, as they are extremely valuable to most of the Indians, an account of the wonderful medicinal properties attributed to their scales and to their nails, it is very difficult to procure them, and as yet we have only one in our collection.\n\nThe specimen we found at Pulo Pinang seems to be full-grown; its total length is three feet and a half, and its tail is only twenty\n\n\u00b9 [Properly panggoling, panggiling.]\ninches long, while its body is very long, and its legs are very short; its little head, which is of the same narrowness as its neck, has the appearance of being sharpened into a pointed cone; its tail, on the contrary, is very thick and strong, rounded above and flat underneath, sharp at the sides, and diminishing in size from the top to its point.\n\nThis animal has a very pointed snout, little eyes, a very small mouth cleft underneath, and its round ears resemble great pads more than real conchas. With the exception of the upper part of the nose, the side and inferior parts of the head, underneath the neck, and the stomach, and the inner side of the front legs, the Pangoling is entirely covered, even to the roots of its nails, with scales strong and sharp, and of different shapes and sizes according to the parts they are destined to protect. For instance, those at the top of the head, and those which cover the limbs, get smaller as they come to the nose and fingers; it is the same with those of the tail, they are very narrow at the point and very large at the top. The largest scales are those covering the flanks and rump, they are more than an inch in diameter. Their surfaces are all marked with wrinkles and divergent flutings, and most of them have their ends divided into three lappets. Those which entirely cover the hind legs, and those which fringe the sides of the tail, are alone cut in the shape of a pointed angle. These angular scales are also divided into different classes. The first kind have a rather sharp keel, the second kind are folded into grooves angularly, according to their length, so as to be able to fit in above and below. The sharp sides of the tail have a still more wonderful shape; from underneath each scale several single long hairs are seen to appear, while there is not a single one to be seen on the parts we have indicated as being naked.\n\nThe Pangolings are not such slow animals as you might expect at first; they run fast enough, and climb quite easily, by means of their strong and sharp nails, and by helping themselves with their tail, using it as a hand or as a buttress. These animals always go along ferreting about and looking under dead leaves and under old trunks of trees for larvae and insects, which is their staple food.\n\nBut the most remarkable faculty the Pangoling possesses is that of rolling itself up into a ball, when it is threatened with danger. To do this it stops all of a sudden, doubles itself up, puts its head between its front legs and finishes by covering itself with a complete scaly armour by putting its long and broad tail over its feet and above its head.\n\nThese animals have five fingers on each foot, armed with strong and pointed nails; but of these five fingers, pulled out to their utmost length, only the three middle ones are strong and long enough to be of service to the Pangoling in climbing and in digging, the outer ones are too short to be of any use to them.\nNotice on two Shrew-Mice of India.\n\nThese little quadrupeds have been distinguished under the name of field-mice, shrew-mice, *Sorex musaraneus*, because, owing to their common form, they are so very closely related with rats, strictly speaking *Mus*, but which in other ways differ completely in their organic characters and even in certain exterior characters, remarkable enough, even if they only existed for the purpose of preventing them from being confounded with the rats. The shrew-mice, essentially destined for an insectivorous life, have partly an organization quite fitted to this kind of life: their teeth have been armed with sharp points, and their jaws furnished on all their circumference with a scarcely interrupted series of canine sharp incisors. None the less are their exterior characters to be compared to their nocturnal and subterraneous habits. Their snout, which is formed into a movable and pointed trunk, serves them as an instrument for digging into the earth to look for food; and their eyes, reduced to two bright specks scarcely visible, suffice to guide them in their excavations underground, and at the same time by their smallness protecting them against things which would have got into them had they been larger; but what serves to distinguish the shrew-mice more than anything else, is the strong musky smell which generally all their species give out; it is a strong smell which comes from a sort of pomade secreted by a particular small matter of granular follicles, which is found on all the true shrew-mice on the lower parts of their body. These follicles, covered with little strong short hairs convergent together, are dotted about on a longitudinal line along nearly the whole of the length of the flanks of all the well-known shrew-mice. On the contrary, in the other two specimens which we have to notice as we live in India, these little glands are concentrated into one, and are round and can be seen on both sides of their body a little behind the shoulder; it is principally to note this slight irregularity in the form of an organ which seems to have some internal connection with the organization of these little animals, that we will give here the description of the two varieties which form part of our collection. Although they are one of the most remarkable species of their kind, because of their body, which is sometimes as long as six inches and more, without counting the tail, which is more than three inches long, and although it is extremely common in Bengal and in the Indian Archipelago, where it is vulgarly known under the name of musky rat, it has nevertheless as yet only been imperfectly described. The only writer who mentioned it particularly is Buffon, who indicates it, more than describes it, as a low animal brought from Pondicherry by Mr. Sonnerat: but as his description is incomplete and as he omitted, according to his habit, to give this species a\nLatin name, the result was that it has been confounded with some other kind by the nomenclators; at any rate it has been impossible for us to recognize them in any of their catalogues, if we venture to give it the name of Sorex Indicus, without fear of giving the word a double meaning.\n\nThis shrew-mouse, as we have said before, is a little more than six inches long, its tail being about half the size, while its size and form are like the common rat; its fur is of a pretty light grey underneath, and slightly browny above; it may yet be distinguished by the pale pink tint of its naked parts and feet, its tail, the sides of its mouth and ears.\n\nIts quadrangular tail is covered with tiny scaly compartments, which are very fine and furnished with spare hairs, some short and some long. Its snout, straight and flexible like a little trunk, divided at its extremity into two little tubercles, reaches more than half an inch further than the inferior snout.\n\nLastly, its eyes are extremely small, and its ears round and short, bare, and pressed against the head, are joined in the inside by two large valves, which can almost completely shut the auditory meatus.\n\nThe generic characters in this shrew-mouse, as we have already said, consist in a tiny moschiverous gland situated behind each shoulder, and in a digestive organ, just like that of other shrew-mice: thus they have six incisors above and four below, the ends of which are very long; it has one canine and four molar teeth in the upper jaw, and only one canine and three molar teeth in the lower one.\n\nWith the shrew-mouse as well as with several kinds of rodents and marsupialia the vulva and the anus open into one common duct.\n\nOur second species of shrew-mouse only differs by its body from the other species we have just described; three inches and a half from the extremity of its snout to the beginning of its tail, is its greatest length, and otherwise it is exactly the same animal, with the short and quadrangular tail, the long and flexible snout, bare ears with large interior valves, tiny little eyes, the feet with five toes, and the grey colour a little darker on its back; the teeth, the intestinal duct, and the moschiverous gland are exactly the same in every respect to the preceding species, and the vulva and anus open into a common drain too.\n\nNotice on the Viverra Mungos.\n\nOwing to a kind of inborn pride which most of us possess, of only thinking of ourselves as the object of all the wonders of creation, and above all if they can come in for our own use, the happy instinct which renders certain animals natural enemies of\nsome hurtful species, has always been considered as a means employed by Nature for protecting mankind from too great a multiplication of some destructive beings who have escaped from its bountiful keeping. This idea, above all with those people naturally inclined to mysticism, ought particularly to lead to exaggerate the instinctive inclinations of these little quadrupeds so celebrated under the name of ichneumon for their combats with the most dangerous reptiles. That is why the Egyptians (who worship these animals) believe that they are incessantly hunting for crocodile's eggs, which they break just for the pleasure of doing an abhorred creature an injury; and not able to attack these great amphibians openly, they try to attack them when asleep with wide-open mouth, then they throw themselves with fury at their throats and kill them by eating out their tongue and their guts: but one fact which has contributed more than anything to increase the marvellous in the history of the ichneumons is that of their deadly combat with the Cobra di Capello. It is scarcely to be believed that such feeble quadrupeds could stand up before such mighty adversaries, without supposing that Nature taught them the means of neutralizing the terrible effects of the most terrible of poisons.\n\nTo verify this phenomenon, nothing better can be found than to imagine that the ichneumons knew a certain Dyc tom the power of which rendered the bite of the worst vipers harmless. If only this precious plant could be discovered, it would be pointed out as a sure specific against every kind of animal, and the botanists would consecrate its astounding properties by giving it the name of Ophioriza Mungos. A circumstance easy enough to explain, very probably, gave rise to this fable.\n\nWhen the Cobra di Capello, attacked by the ichneumon, keep up the defence too long and vigorously, it happens sometimes that these last named, worn out with fatigue, retire from the battlefield a minute to take breath, and then return to the combat with renewed ardour. Thus this momentary retreat can easily be interpreted. But how can we be content with an explanation natural enough in a case as extraordinary as this? The most marvellous ought to seem the most likely. Besides, people were convinced that the ichneumons only disappeared for a few minutes to be able to look for a remedy for their wounds. As to what is true in all these stories, manufactured by report, is that they possess most wonderful courage and voracity, and that they are very fond of all kinds of eggs, and that they seem to prefer reptiles to any other prey; that they attack everything they have strength enough to put to death; and that if they are not even afraid of fighting the most venomous, it is because their poison has no great effect upon them, which would not be anything so extraordinary, as we know of several poisons which have no effect\nupon certain animals, or, rather, because they are agile enough to avoid the deadly fangs of their enemy; and we must own that this seems the most likely. If the ichneumon did not fear the poison of the cobras, why would it seize them in a way to avoid their poisoned fangs? and why, from fear of a single bite, should it prolong the attack for hours, often uselessly\u2014an attack which would be extremely hurtful to it\u2014if it were not kept back from ending it by the fear of a single bite?\n\nWe have ourselves no confirmed observation on this subject; but the assertions of several trustworthy persons, who have assured us of their having seen ichneumons killed by the cobras, seems to us to tend greatly to the support of this last-named probability.\n\nThe ichneumons, as well as the other Viverras, are to be found in all warm climates of the old continent. As their species are not numerous (there are not more than four kinds), and as their instinct has always attracted the attention of all travellers, it follows that there are descriptions exact enough; nevertheless, we do not think it useless to give the ichneumon of India (Viverra Mungos of Linneus) a place here. This species, which is the most celebrated for its combats with the Cobra di Capello, is not as large as the ichneumon of Egypt. Its body, from the tip of the nose to the beginning of the tail, is never longer than fifteen inches, and its slender tail, which ends in a point, is from nine to ten inches long. Its head is of quite a different shape than the other Viverras. The bones of the nose are very much arched above the nostrils, the forehead seems to end in a snout rather higher than large, and the round ears are pressed against the head, and are very far back; this gives its head a still more particular aspect; in short, this ichneumon is a very long animal and low on its legs. Its body, covered with rather long and rough fur, and shaded from four to five times with dark-brown and white, has the appearance of being uniformly quilled with the same colour. On the snout and at the extremities of the four paws, this fur is very scarce; everywhere else it is lined underneath with a woolly and russet-coloured down like the otters.\n\nThis Viverra, like the others, has five toes to each foot, but the nails are all longer, sharper, and hardly retractile; like the others it has also six little incisors, three false molars and two long canine ones in each jaw, one carnivorous one and three tuberculous above, and below four false molars, one tuberculous one, and a carnivorous one; then the anus of the Viverra Mungos opens at the end of a large bag in which certain glands exude a particular humour. Although these little animals are instinctively very cruel, and are not satisfied except with slaughter, they can be tamed nevertheless easily enough, and be allowed to run about freely in the house. But domestication does not in\nany way affect their sanguinary instinct, for, however well fed they may be, they kill anything that happens to resist them just as cruelly, and are always giving chase to the rats, fowls, birds, and snakes.\n\nNotice on the Porcupines of India.\n\nIf there are animals who ought to be positively well known, it would be the porcupines, the numerous specimens of which are very common, and they are otherwise very curious for their sharp quills which clothe their body instead of fur; nevertheless, when we come to consult the descriptions the nomenclators have given of them, we find them so very vague and incomplete, that we cannot be positively sure of either their number, identity, or of the different varieties indicated. So, to keep to the specimens of the old continent, the common porcupines of the southern parts of Europe, Africa and India, which are certainly different, at any rate those of the last-named country, we count as one animal, while certain authors have divided them into two distinct species from the only porcupine with the long penicillegorous tail of the Eastern continent and isles; let us show them that we know more. We have said that the common porcupine of India was different to that of Italy; we will add further, that we believe there are two particular varieties in Asia quite similar in form, it is true, to the Hystrix cristata, but which differs in the way in which the black and white bands run on their quills.\n\nDuring our stay in Bengal we were able to procure several specimens of this species of porcupine, which is commonly found in this country; but being ourselves led away by the general opinion, we did not give it enough attention to notice that it differed from the European species, and it was only after our first journey to Pulo Pinang that we verified this difference, having accidentally compared the quills of the short-tailed porcupine which you find in this island as well as in Sumatra, and probably throughout the Sunda archipelago, with some of those we brought from Calcutta, and we were struck with the different placing of the colours on each kind, and saw then that they belonged to a different species of animal, not only they, but neither of these species were, as people have believed till now, a long-haired porcupine; in fact, this latter kind has all its quills white at the extremities.\n\nThe quills of the Bengal porcupine, white at first, have a little above their roots a little black ring, then a white one, and then they are entirely black to their extremities, while those of the Sunda islands are quite white, with the exception of a single black ring situated a little above the middle part; this is the only real difference we can indicate as yet between these three species; but it is probable that comparing each one would lead us to find out other kinds.\nThe total length of the largest we have seen does not exceed twenty-eight inches: its head is nearly five inches, and its tail hardly three inches long; when it bristles up and lifts up its back, it stands about from fourteen to fifteen inches high; otherwise this species has just the same shape and proportions as the common European porcupine. Its ears are round and bare; its snout thick, shaped like a trunk; it has five toes on the hind and four on the fore-legs; one nailed tubercle serves as a thumb; its long quills only cover the posterior half of the body; the chest, the upper and lower parts of the shoulders, are covered with another kind of quill, much shorter, flat like the blade of a sword, and quite black, with the exception of some which are white at the ends, and forming under the throat a kind of half-collar of this same colour. Those on the nape of the neck are white at the tips, but they are differently shaped; they are thick round hairs, a little longer than the rest, nevertheless without being sufficient to form a mane; the thick stiff hairs which cover the feet and legs are more sturdy, shorter, and of a very deep black: the tail is short and straightens itself when the animal stands up. At the beginning of the tail are quills like those on the back, and those at the tip resemble very delicate and elastic hairs, entirely white, swollen at the ends into round tubes and ending naturally in sharp points. Although they are mostly open and hollow, when the porcupine bristles itself up these tubes rub together and produce a kind of audible dull noise: not counting the different quills we have spoken of, the porcupines have still here and there, and chiefly on the lower parts of their body, other very long and slender quills, with a single black ring on them, like the others.\n\nTo terminate the history of this porcupine we must add that at Bencoolen it is called Landah, and that we have provisionally specified it under the name of *Hystrix torquatus*; lastly, we must mention that, in Bengal, the one we described at the commencement of this article is called Lazaroo.\n\nWe must now speak of the long brush-tailed porcupine, and to prove (what is in fact the general opinion) that the *Hystrix macrura* is nothing else than the fasciculata of Linneus. In fact, the only particular character which Seba and Shreber gave to their macrura, was the twofold enlargement of the thongs of the elastic hair at the end of the tail, which several descriptions of the porcupine of Queda mention; but this character is of no value whatever; for on the same animal these enlarged hairs are always to be found. Besides this the long-tailed porcupine is well enough known; it has even been seen in Europe several times, nevertheless we believe it to be still possible to add some interesting facts to his description.\n\nIt seems that this species is never longer than from seventeen to eighteen inches, without counting the tail, which is from eight\nto nine inches long; it stands lower on its legs, its body and its head are longer, and its proportions are generally far less massive than those of the porquatus; its quills, the longest of which is never more than an inch and a half, are of the same shape as those covering the shoulders of the last named, that is to say, they are flat like the blade of a sword and very much fluted at the top; those on the back are of a greyish colour, with a large brown speckle in the middle; those on the lower parts of the body, on the contrary, are only white at the roots, and are quite black otherwise: imperceptibly those on the legs take the form of coarse round hairs; besides the Malacca porcupine has, like the others, on the lower parts of the body, several long black hairs, dotted about here and there among its ordinary quills: their tail is covered at the top with needles like those on the back, and is not, as some say, scaly nearly everywhere; on the contrary, it is well covered with very fine and delicate spikes which appear to be the remains of the old ones, which surround the ends in the form of a tuft: otherwise these are, as we have already said, either singly or doubly in thongs, and these thongs are naturally pointed at the tip, and are never truncated, except by accident. This singular species always carries its tail lifted up like a trumpet, and makes the tuft at the end tremble, like the others.\n\nWe have counted on each jaw, like on the preceding ones, except the two great ordinary incisors, four cylinder-like teeth concentrically striated at their crown, and it has, like the others, five toes on the hind and four on the fore-feet with a tubercle taking the place of a thumb.\n\n---\n\nXII.\n\nDESCRIPTIONS OF MALAYAN PLANTS.\n\nBy WILLIAM JACK.\n\n[\u201cMalayan Miscellanies\u201d (Bencoolen, 1820-22), vol. i.

Leaves alternate, petiolate, semicordate, inequilateral, turning to one side, 8 inches long, acute, with gross subspinescent serratures, villous beneath, adult leaves smooth above, nerves generally dichotomous. Petioles thick, round, furrowed above. Stipules none. Peduncles axillary or supra-axillary. Flowers unilateral, erect, arranged in two rows on a recurved spike, nearly sessile, crowded. Bracts cuneiform, obtuse. Calyx semi-superior, ovate, villous, 5-lobed, lobes obtuse. Corolla white, campanulate, persistent, limb recurved, 5-lobed, lobes obtuse; after florescence the corolla becomes green and enlarges. Stamina 5, erect, short, inserted on the calyx and opposite to its divisions. Anthers linear, acute. Ovarium surrounded by the calyx and connected with it by five longitudinal septa or processes, from which the stamens spring, 3 or 4-celled, many-seeded, placentae from the inner angles of the cells. Style short, thick. Stigma large, thick, 3-lobed. Capsule 3 or 4-celled, containing numerous seeds arranged on convex placentae.\n\nThe septa which unite the calyx and ovary appear continuous with the filaments of the stamens. The young parts of the plant are densely villous, but the hairs are easily rubbed away. In drying, the plant assumes a bright yellow colour. It appears extremely doubtful whether this plant be truly referrible to Phyteuma; it does not, however, agree well with any other genus of the family of Campanulaceae, and it will deserve consideration whether it ought not to constitute a new genus in that order.\n\nCURCULIGO SUMATRANA \u2014 Roxb.\n\n*Hexandria Monogynia.*\n\nFoliis lato-lanceolatis plicatis glabris, spicis densis brevibus, tubo perianthii bacc\u00e2 longiore.\n\nInvolucrum.

Fruit geminate, one commonly abortive, the rudiment of which remains at the base of the perfect one, which is sub-rotund, covered with a coriaceous rind and echinate with long soft spines, 1-seeded, the seed covered with a white acid pulp.\nThe fruit is much esteemed, and has an agreeable subacid flavour. The parts of the flower vary much in number; six is perhaps the most frequent number of the stamina. There is but one style, not two as commonly described. The affinities of this tree seem to have been little understood. It belongs without doubt to the family of the Sapindi, and is closely related to Scytalia, as justly conjectured by the author of the botanical articles in Rees' \"Cyclopaedia.\"\n\nSAPINDUS RUBIGINOSUS.\u2014ROXB.\n\nOctandria Monogynia.\nArborescens inermis, paniculis terminalibus, calicibus 5 phyllis, corollis 4-petalis, baccis tribus connatis oblongis.\nKulit layu.

Stipules linear, generally bifid. Panicles terminal. Flowers for the most part in threes, involucrated with deciduous trifid and linear bracts. Calyx 5-leaved, spreading, leaflets oblong concave. Corolla yellow, less than the calyx, petals ovate, unguiculate and without nectaries. Stamina numerous, inserted below the germen. Germen stipitate. Drupe containing a nut marked externally with five lines, 3-celled, 3-seeded.\n\nThis agrees perfectly with the excellent description given by Sir J. E. Smith in Rees' \"Cyclopaedia,\" from a specimen preserved in the herbarium of the younger Linn\u00e6us, unaccompanied with any notice concerning its native country, and also deficient in fruit. Its affinity to the original species of Microcos is fully proved on actual examination of the fruit, and this exact agreement affords a further confirmation of the propriety of separating Microcos from Grewia. The terminal inflorescence and involucral bracteae form a peculiar and distinctive character. In this species the flowers are generally three together, and are surrounded by three trifid bracteae, within which are found three other smaller and linear ones.\n\nMICROCOS GLABRA.\u2014W.

Style erect, as long as the stamina. Stigma bifid. Calyx of the fruit flat, enlarged, fleshy and white. Berry from 1 to 4-seeded, according to the number that abort.\n\nThis species approaches nearest to the C. infortunatum, but is abundantly distinguished by the softness of the leaves, which are larger and more deeply cordate, by the comparative shortness of the tube of the corolla, and by the white calyx of the fruit.\n\nBesides this species, I have met with another in various parts of these islands, and particularly at Acheen, which has been figured in Andrews\u2019 \u201cRepository\u201d under the name of Clerodendrum pyramidale. It is a large, showy plant. A still more beautiful species, and perhaps the most elegant of the whole genus, is the C. nutans, so named by my friend Dr. Wallich, Superintendent of the Botanic Garden at Calcutta, who received it from the North-eastern frontier of Bengal. I found it not uncommon at Pulo Pinang, and this is not the only instance in which I have had occasion to observe a coincidence between the plants of these distant countries. This species is characterized as follows:\n\nC. nutans, Wall.\u2014Foliis lanceolatis acuminatis glabris, paniculis longissimis terminalibus mutantibus, pedunculis remotis divaricatis paucifloris.\n\nThese panicles or racemes hang gracefully from the extremity of the branches, the flowers are white, not numerous, the peduncles,\nor primary divisions of the panicle being remote, opposite, divaricate, short, and seldom bearing more than three flowers.

J.\n\nErecta, pilosa, foliis longis spatulatis acutis serratis subtus rubris, pedunculis 2\u20135 axillaris unifloris basi cum petiolo co\u00ebuntibus, staminibus duobus fertilibus.\n\nTimmu. Malay.\n\nNative of the forests of Pulo Pinang.\n\nRoot long and tapering. Stem short, erect, thick, rough beneath with the vestiges of fallen leaves. The whole plant is covered with hairs. Leaves alternate, crowded, subsessile, long, spatulate, 9 or 10 inches in length, acute, obtuse at the base, serrated, rugose, hairy, brownish green above, purplish red beneath, middle nerve strong and thick, forming a short petiole at the base. Stipules none. Peduncles 2 to 5 in each axil, 1-flowered, round, 2 inches long, uniting at the base into a short thick unilateral rachis, densely pilose, and adhering beneath to the petiole. Bracts linear, 2, alternate on each peduncle. Calyx 5-parted, hairy, reddish, lacini\u00e6 erect, linear, acute, the upper one smaller. Corolla white, tinged with purple externally, much longer than the calyx, infundibuliform; tube somewhat gibbous at the base, incurved, expanding above, limb bilabiata, upper lip 2-lobed, lower 3-lobed, larger, internally streaked with yellow, all the segments roundish, obtuse, not very unequal. Stamina inserted within the tube, 2 fertile, with the rudiments of 2 abortive ones, the former scarcely so long as the corolla, conniving at their summits. Anthers composed of 2 divaricate transverse lobes. Ovarium linear, surrounded at the base with a white tubular entire nectarial ring or cup, and produced into a tomentose style of the same length as the stamens. Stigma\nobtuse, truncate. Capsule long, linear, silique-shaped, cylindrical, acute, somewhat tomentose, an inch long, 2-valved, 2-celled, dissepiments contrary, with 2 lobes which are parallel to the valves, revolute and seed-bearing at their margins, and part the cells in such a manner as to give the appearance of a 4-celled siliqua. Seeds numerous, naked, small, and subrotund.\n\nObs.\u2014The deep red colour of the lower surface of the leaves and the crested disposition of the flowers in their axils render this a very remarkable species. The aestivation is imbricate, the two lateral lobes of the lower lip being the outermost. The genus is nearly related to Incarvillea, but differs in having simple naked seeds.\n\nDIDYMOCARPUS REPTANS.\u2014W.

Berries coadunate, 2-celled, many seeded! Seeds numerous, angular.\n\nObs.\u2014The flowers of this species are perfectly similar to those of the preceding, but the fruit presents a singular anomaly in being polyspermous. Both differ so much from the other species of Morinda that I think they might properly constitute a new and distinct genus.\n\nEUTHEMIS.\u2014W.

Racemes erect, with 1 or 2 branches near the base, at first terminal, afterwards lateral and oppositifolious, by the shooting up of the stem from the base of the peduncle. Flowers predicellate, generally in pairs. Bracts ovate, acute. Calyx inferior, 5-leaved, spreading, leaflets ovate, obtuse, ciliate, the 2 inner ones rather smaller. Corolla white, sometimes tinged with purple, 5-petaled, petals twice as long as the calyx, reflexed, ovate-oblong, obtuse. Stamina 5, inserted below the ovarium; alternating with these are sometimes found 5 short abortive filaments. Filaments very short. Anthers longer,\nerect, conniving round the style, oblong, prolonged into acumina, which are sometimes a little contorted, and which open at their summits by a pore, the cells are adnate below to the sides of the filament. Ovary oblong, acute. Style filiform, erect, equal to the stamens. Stigma simple. Berry snow-white, globular, obscurely angled, crowned with the persistent style, which is obliquely deflexed; of a spongy or farinose substance, containing in the centre 5 seeds, which are disposed round the axis, and enclosed in arilli composed of tough longitudinal fibres.

Malay.\n\nFound abundantly at Singapore.\n\nA small branchy shrub with hard dry leaves, exhibiting the peculiar character of this family. Leaves alternate, sessile, lanceolate, acute, mucronate, very entire, very smooth, shining and convexed above, somewhat glaucous below, and, when examined by the microscope, appearing to be covered with numerous very minute white dots, firm, with scarcely perceptible longitudinal nerves. Spikes axillary, erect, much shorter than the leaves; peduncles somewhat tomentose. Calyx supported at the base by two oval acute concave bracts, 5-leaved, oblong, acute, leaflets lanceolate, glaucescent, ciliate. Corolla infundibuliform, a little longer than the calyx, quinquefid, puberulent, segments lanceolate, bearded above beyond the base. Stamina 5, short, alternate with the laciniae; filaments subulate; anthers subpendulous, marked on each side with a longitudinal furrow, simple, and bursting longitudinally in the manner so accurately described by Mr. R. Brown, \"Prodr. Fl. N. Holl.\" p. 535. Pollen globose. Ovary surrounded at the base by 5 distinct erect obtuse scales, 5-celled, each cell containing a single oblong ovulum. Style erect, villous. Stigma subglobose. Drupe baccate, subglobose, 5-celled, cells 1-seeded.\n\nObs.\u2014The discovery of this species is remarkable, as forming an\nexception to the general geographical distribution of the Epacrid\u00e6, a family almost exclusively confined to Australasia or at least to the southern hemisphere. Singapore, situated at the extremity of the Malay peninsula, and forming as it were the connecting link between continental or Western India and the islands of the great Eastern Archipelago, partakes of this character in its Flora, which exhibits many remarkable points of coincidence with the Floras of both regions. I have had occasion to observe resemblances between its productions and those of the northern frontier of Bengal on the one hand, and of the Moluccas on the other, while the present connects it with the still more distant range of New Holland.\n\nRAUWOLFIA SUMATRANA.\u2014W.

Mag.\" t. 1488, but is a much larger plant, and is abundantly distinguished by the 2-leaved involucre, the long erect leaflets within it, and the flowers drooping to one side.\n\nVERATRUM (?) MALAYANUM.\u2014W. J.\n\nFoliis radicalibus lanceolatis, scapis erectis verticillato-paniculatis, baccis trilocularibus.\n\nNative of Pulo Pinang.\n\nAn erect herbaceous plant. Leaves radical, 3 or 4 feet in length, petiolate, lanceolate, acuminate, attenuated into a petiole at the base, very entire, tomentose, striated with parallel nerves, which run nearly longitudinally but diverge from a central one. Petioles canaliculate, obtusely carinate, sheathing at the base.\nScape erect, round, tomentose, verticillately panicled. Peduncles alternately semiverticillate, divaricate and spreading. Flowers sessile, on hermaphrodite or male plants fascicled, on female solitary. Beneath each semiverticil is a large floral leaf, which is ovate, acute, and contracted at the base into a flat, straight, petiole-like unguis, which embraces the stem. Perianth 6-parted, the 3 inner laciniae petaliform, white, spreading. Stamina 6; filaments flat, dilated at the base. Styles 3, short. Stigmata 3.\n\nIn the female the calyx embraces a globular berry which is 3-celled, each cell 1-seeded.\n\nObs.\u2014The true place of this plant is somewhat ambiguous, and I am doubtful whether it can be admitted as a genuine species of Veratrum. It does not, however, agree exactly with any other genus of the same family; in habit it is somewhat like Alisma.\n\nMEMECYLON C\u00c6RULEUM.\u2014W. J.\n\nOctandria Monogynia.\n\nFoliis cordatis amplexicaulibus, pedunculis axillaribus brevibus, pedicellis appositis divaricatis brevibus, fructibus ovatis.\n\nK\u00fblit nipis. Malay.\n\nNative of Pulo Pinang.\n\nA handsome shrub, of 10 or 12 feet in height, with round smooth branches. Leaves opposite, subsessile, about 5 inches in length, cordate, amplexicaul, oblong, acute, very entire, margin reflexed, coriaceous, very smooth, deep green and shining above, lateral nerves inconspicuous, uniting at their extremities into a line which runs parallel to the margin. Stipules none. Peduncles axillary, solitary, short, few-flowered; pedicels short and thick, opposite, somewhat verticillate, divaricate, forming a kind of corymbiform head. Flowers blue. Bracts opposite, short, acute. Calyx superior, coloured, smooth, nearly entire, becoming by age more distinctly 4-toothed. Corolla deep blue, 4-petaled, spreading, petals broad, ovate, acute. Stamina 8, erect, shorter than the corolla. Filaments short. Anthers blue, attached by their middle, horizontal, shaped somewhat like the head of an axe, with a knob behind; cells parallel on the anterior edge. Before expansion the anthers are bent downwards (somewhat in the manner of the Melastom\u00e6), and the surface of the germen and bottom of the calyx are marked with their impressions, of which the 4 inner are the deepest; the ridges between them form 8 sharp prominent rays, and there are 8 other less conspicuous lines formed by the faces of the bilocular anthers. Ovarium ovate, 1-celled, containing from 6 to 8 erect ovula. Style filiform, a little longer than the stamina. Stigma acute. Berry cortical, crowned by the persistent calyx, ovate, a little oblique at the base, 1-seeded,\nthe rudiments of the abortive ovula surrounding the umbilicus. Seed ovate, umbilicate at the base and a little oblique. Albumen none. Embryo erect. Cotyledons membranaceous, contortuplicate. Radicle cylindrical, nearly as long as the seed, obverse to the umbilicus.\n\nObs.\u2014The different species of Memecylon have not been well defined by authors; this appears to differ from M. cordatum Lamarck, and M. grande Retz., or Nedum chetti (Rheed, \"Mal.\" ii. p. 21. t. 15) in having ovate not globose fruit, and in the flowers not being umbelled. In the latter the flowers are small, yellow and numerous, in this they are larger, blue, and much fewer in number.\n\nLAURUS PARTHENOXYLON.\u2014W. J.\n\nEnneandria Monogynia.\n\nFoliis venosis ovatis acutis petiolatis subtus glaucis, paniculis brevibus paucifloris axillaribus et lateralibus, fructu globoso calyci truncato insidente.\n\nK\u00e2yu g\u00e2dis. Malay.\n\nAbundant in the forests of Sumatra.\n\nThis is a lofty timber tree. Bark brown and rough. Leaves alternate, rather long petioled, ovate, acute, often acuminate, and varying in breadth, about 3 inches long, entire with somewhat revolute edges, smooth, glaucous beneath, nerves lateral and irregularly alternate. Petioles round, an inch long. Peduncles from the young shoots at the extremity of the branches, axillary or lateral, terminated by a short few-flowered panicle, and generally longer than the young leaves, from whose axils they spring. Bracts none. Perianth funnel-shaped, 6-parted, yellowish. Stamina 9, arranged in 2 rows, the outer 6 naked, the inner 3 furnished at the base with 2 yellow glands; filaments flat; anthers adnate, the cells opening with a longitudinal valve or operculum. Style as long as the stamens. Stigma obtuse, 4-cornered. Drupe seated on the enlarged cup-shaped, persistent truncated base of the perianth, globose, containing a 1-seeded nut. Embryo inverse. Cotyledons hemispherical. Radicle superior, within the edge of the cotyledons.\n\nObs.\u2014This species has considerable affinity to L. cupularia. The fruit has a strong balsamic smell, and yields an oil, which is considered useful in rheumatic affections, and has the same balsamic odour as the fruit itself. An infusion of the root is drank in the same manner as sassafras, which it appears to resemble in its qualities. The wood is strong and durable when not exposed to wet, and in that case considered equal to teak. K\u00e2yu g\u00e2dis signifies the virgin tree, whence the specific name.\nMay this be the Oriental sassafras wood mentioned under the article \"Laurus\" in Rees' Cyclop\u00e6dia?\"\n\nGOMPHIA SUMATRANA.\u2014W. J.\n\nDecandria Monogygnea.\n\nN. O. Ochnaceae.\n\nFoliis lanceolatis vel oblongo ovalibus acuminatis obtuse denticulatis nitidis subquinque nerviis, stipulis intrapetiolaribus deciduis, paniculis terminalibus.\n\nSib\u00fbru. Malay.\nSumatra.\n\nA large shrub or small tree. Leaves alternate, short petioled, 8 or 9 inches in length, from lanceolate to oblong oval, varying considerably in breadth from 2 to 3 inches, acuminate, acute at the base, obtusely denticulate, very smooth, shining, middle nerve very strong, lateral veins numerous, transverse, somewhat reticulate, delicate, uniting near each margin into two nerves, which run parallel to it almost the whole length, and give the leaf the appearance of being 5-nerved. Petioles very short. Stipules intrapetiolar, broad at the base, acuminate, deciduous. Panicles terminal, not much branched; pedicles slender, rarely solitary, surrounded at their bases by small acute bracts. Calyx 5-leaved, persistent, leaflets ovate, acute, smooth, lucid. Corolla yellow, 5-petaled, scarcely longer than the calyx. Stamina 10; filaments very short; anthers long, linear, opening at the top by 2 pores. Style as long as the stamina. Stigma acute. Ovaries 5, surrounding the base of the style, and elevated on a receptacle. This receptacle enlarges as the fruit ripens. The number of abortive ovaries is variable; sometimes only 1 comes to perfection. The berries are drupaceous, obliquely reniform, somewhat compressed, 1-seeded. Seed exalbuminous.\n\nObs.\u2014This appears to have so much resemblance to the G. Malabarica, Decand. Puah Chetti (Rheed, \"Mal.\" v. p. 103. t. 52), that I have some hesitation in proposing it as a distinct species. The points of difference are the following: The leaves of this are much longer than those of the Malabar species, which are described as almost veinless, while in this the transverse veins unite into two very distinct marginal nerves, which it is difficult to suppose could have escaped observation had they existed in the other. The representation of the inflorescence in Rheed's figure is unintelligible, and his description of it is not much clearer; but as far as it can be made out, it appears different from this. Further examination of the Malabar plant will be necessary to determine whether this is really distinct, and whether the differences above noticed exist in the plant itself, or are mere omissions in the description.\nMURRAYA PANICULATA.\n\nDecandria Monogynia.\n\nN. O. Aurantiae.\n\nFoliolis ovatis acuminatis, floribus terminalibus axillaribusque subsolitariis, baccis oblongis saepins dispermis.\n\nChalcas paniculata. Lour. \"Fl. Coch.\" p. 270.\nCamunium. Rumph. \"Amb.\" v. p. 26, t. 17.\nKamuning. Malay.\n\nThis is an abundantly distinct species from M. exotica, though unaccountably confounded with it by later authors. Loureiro discriminates between them very well, and his description is, on the whole, good. Rumphius's figure is bad, but preserves several of the distinguishing characters, particularly in the inflorescence and leaves, which, however, are not sufficiently acuminate. It grows to the size of a small tree, and the wood is much employed for the handles of krises, being capable of receiving a fine polish. The leaflets are generally 5, ovate, terminating in a long acumen, which is slightly emarginate at the point, shining and very entire, the terminal one considerably the largest. In M. exotica, the leaflets are more numerous and closer, obovate, blunt, and of a much firmer, thicker substance. The flowers of M. paniculata are fewer and larger than those of M. exotica, and are sometimes terminal, generally 1 or 2 together from the axils of the upper leaves. The ovarium is 2-celled; the berries are oblong, reddish, and mostly contain 2 seeds, which are covered with silky hairs. The berries of M. exotica are ovate and generally 1-seeded. The whole habit of the 2 plants is very distinct. The specific name paniculata is objectionable, as the flowers are much less panicled than in the other species.\n\nThe Camunium sinense (Rumph. v. t. 18, f. 1), which is commonly met with in gardens in all the Malay islands, is quite a distinct genus from the other 2 Camuniuns, and has been described by Loureiro, \"Fl. Cochinch.\" i. p. 173, under the name of\n\nAGLAIA ODORATA.\n\nIt has a 5-parted inferior calyx, and 5-petaled corolla. The stamens are 5 in number, and are inserted in the manner of the Meliaceae on the inside of an ovate nectarial tube, which is contracted at the mouth, and conceals the anthers. The stigma is large, sessile, simple as far as I have observed, not double as stated by Loureiro. The ovary appears to be 1-celled, and to contain 2 pendulous ovula. It rarely ripens its fruit in these islands, but, according to Loureiro, it bears a small red 1-seeded berry. The flowers are very small, yellow and fragrant, in small axillary panicles.\nIn the catalogue of the \"Hortus Bengalensis,\" p. 18, this plant is specified under the name of Camunium sinense, after Rumphius. The Murraya paniculata above described is the true Kam\u00fbning of the Malays, and the name C. sinense is only applied by Rumphius in the manner of the older botanical authors, as one of comparison and resemblance, for want of a better of native origin; if, therefore, the generic name Camunium is to be adopted at all, it ought to be applied to the plant to which it really belongs, and cannot be admitted for one of a different family not indigenous to the Malay islands. On this account Loureiro's name is to be preferred.\n\nRHIZOPHORA CARYOPHYLLOIDES.\u2014W. J.\n\n*Dodecandra Monogynia.*\n\nFruticosa, foliis ovato-lanceolatis utrinque acutis, pedunculis axillaribus trifloris, rarius dichotome quinquefloris, floribus 8-fidis, radic\u00e2 subcylindric\u00e2 acutiuscula.\n\n*Mangium caryophylloides.* Rumph. \"Amb.\" iii. p. 119, t. 78.\n\nFound at Singapore and Pulo Pinang.\n\nThis is a much smaller shrub than the common mangrove, and does not divide its roots so much. It is generally found in shallow sandy salt marshes, rising with a tolerably erect stem and branched nearer to the base than the common species. Leaves opposite, petiolate, about 4 inches long, oval or ovate-lanceolate, acute at both ends, sometimes slightly inequilateral, very entire, very smooth, coriaceous; the lower surface appearing under the lens dotted with minute white points. Petioles round, furrowed above, smooth. Stipules long, enveloping the corniculate buds in the manner of the Ficus, very deciduous. Peduncles axillary, solitary, 3-flowered, shorter than the petioles; sometimes they are dichotomously 5-flowered, having a flower in the bifurcation. Calyx semi-inferior, surrounding the ovary, ovate, limb 8-parted, spreading, laciniae linear, acute, thick, rather incurved at their points. Corolla white, 8-petaled, petals nearly erect, alternate with the laciniae of the calyx, conduplicate, enclosing the stamina by pairs, bifid, furnished with a few threads or filaments at the point, ciliated on the margin. Stamina double, the number of the petals inserted on the calyx in a double series, the inner ones shorter, erect, not so long as the petals, enfolded by them until the period of complete expansion, when they burst from their recesses with an elastic force, and disperse their pollen. Anthers linear, acute, 2-celled. Ovarium contained within the calyx, 2-celled, tetrasporous; ovula subrotund, affixed near the top of the cells. Style filiform, as long as the stamens. Stigma bifid with acute laciniae. Fruit contained in the persistent calyx, 1-seeded, the other 3 ovula proving abortive. The seed is at first\novate or roundish, with albumen conform, the embryo inverse, in\nthe upper part of the seed. As the fruit advances, the radicle is\nelongated and becomes at length nearly cylindric, obsoletely\nangled, and rather acute at the point. I have generally found\n3 cotyledons, rarely 4.\n\nObs.\u2014Rumphius's figure is by no means a good representation\nof the plant, but his description of it is correct. It comes nearest\nto the R. cylindrica, Kari Kandel (Rheed, \"Mal.\" vi. p. 59, t. 33),\nwhich differs from this in having the radicle very obtuse and\nmore exactly cylindrical, and the peduncles generally 1 or 2-\nflowered. According to Rumphius this species is rather rare, and\nis called Mangi Mangi Chenke, or Clove Mangrove, whence his\nappellation Caryophylloides, which I have thought proper to\nretain, as the resemblance holds good in some particulars.\n\nACROTREMA.\u2014W.

Petioles\nshort, sheathing; their margins dilated into membranaceous\nauricles which might be considered as adnate stipules. Peduncles\nor scapes central, erect, from 3 to 6 inches high, pilose, recurved\nat the summit, 8 or 10-flowered. Flowers yellow, pedicellate,\nracemose. Calyx 5-leaved, pilose, leaflets ovate acute.

Ovula attached to the inner\nangles. Stigmata simple. Capsules 3.\nObs.\u2014I am at a loss to determine the exact affinities of this plant; it has the habit of the Saxifrage\u00e6, but the number of both the male and female parts of fructification is greater by one-third, and the ovaries are distinct.\n\nLAGERSTR\u00c6MIA FLORIBUNDA.\u2014W.

Leaves subopposite, short-petioled, rather recurved, 7 or 8 inches long, ovate-oblong, somewhat acute, entire, smooth, with strong prominent nerves and reticulate veins. Panicle terminal, much branched, spreading, many-flowered. Peduncles, pedicels and calyces ferruginous, densely villous with stellate hair. The flowers are smaller than those of L. Regin\u00e6, but much more numerous and in much larger panicles, pale rose colour on their first expansion, and passing through various gradations of intensity until at length they become nearly purple. Calyx covered with ferruginous wool, turbinate, regularly marked with many deep longitudinal furrows or ribs, giving it a fluted appearance, limb spreading, 6-parted. Before expansion the calyx is obconical and nearly flat at the top. Corolla 6-petaled, spreading, petals inserted by short ungules alternately with the segments of the calyx, ovate, not much undulated. Stamina red, numerous, inserted on the calyx, 6 of them longer, thicker and more conspicuous than the rest. Ovary thickly covered with white hair, 6-celled, many-seeded. Style erect. Stigma clavate.\n\nObs.\u2014This beautiful and splendid species may be readily distinguished from the L. Regin\u00e6 by the greater size of the panicles, and their ferruginous colour. The flower-buds in that species represent in some degree a double cone, in this a single inverted cone, being flat and even depressed at top. The L. hirsuta \"Lam.\" is also quite distinct from this, having hirsute leaves.\n\nTERNSTR\u00c6MIA RUBIGINOSA.\u2014W.

Leaves alternate, petiolate, 10 to 12 inches long, obovato-lanceolate, acuminate spinuloso-denticulate, smooth; the nerves are furnished with a few appressed, innocuous scale-like spines. Petioles about an inch in length, covered, as well as the summits of the branches and buds, with small ferruginous scales. Flowers in fascicles below the leaves from the axils of the fallen ones of the preceding year; they are pedicellate and white. Calyx coloured, 5-leaved, the two outer leaflets smaller. Corolla white, 5-petaled, petals subrotund, a little longer than the calyx. Stamina numerous, distinct, inserted on the base of the petals; filaments short; anthers oblong, yellowish white, didymous, truncate at the top and there opening by two pores. Ovarium ovate, 3-celled, many seeded, placent\u00e6 from the inner angles of the cells. Style deeply trifid (Styles 3?).

Racemes simple, axillary, secund, shorter than the leaves. Flowers white, short-pedicelled. Calyx deeply 5-parted, laciniae linear, acute. Corolla 5-petaled, fimbriated at the summit. Nectary of 5 yellow retuse glands surrounding the ovary. Stamina 15, erect; 10 are inserted by pairs between the glands of the nectary, the remaining 5 between those glands and the ovary. Anthers linear, bilamellate at the summit. Style as long as the calyx. Stigma simple. Drupe globose, containing a 5-celled nut, which is rugose and marked with 5 obtuse longitudinal ridges; in general only 1 cell is fertile and contains a single seed. Seed furnished with albumen; embryo inverse with flat cotyledons and superior radicle.\n\nObs.\u2014This may perhaps be one of the smaller varieties of Ganitrus mentioned by Rumphius; it differs from E. ganitrus of Roxburgh, who quotes Rumphius, III. t. 10, in the number of the stamens, the position of the racemes, and the number of fertile cells in the nut. Compare Adenoda sylvestris, Loureiro, \"Fl. Cochinch.\" which agrees in the number of the stamens. I suspect Gaertner must have fallen into an error in representing the embryo erect in his Ganitrus; in this it is certainly inverse.\n\nMONOCERA.\u2014W.

Ovarium basi glandulis cinctum, biloculare, polysporum. Drupa nuce 1\u20132 sperma.\n\nThis genus, whose characters appear to be sufficiently distinct, will include, besides the following new species, several hitherto referred to Elaeocarpus\u2014viz., E. Monocera cavanilles, the separation of which has already been suggested, and of which the specific name may be appropriately adopted for the genus E. rugosus, E. aristatus, and E. bilocularis of Roxburgh, probably also E. grandiflora and E. reticulata, Sir J. E. Smith in Rees' \"Cyclopaedia.\" The E. dentata, Dicera dentata, Forst., may also belong to this, if, as remarked by Sir J. E. Smith, Rees' \"Cyclopaedia\" in loco, the anthers have only one of their valves awned, not both equal, as originally stated by Forster. His capsule may perhaps be only the ovary, which will then agree with the present genus.\n\nMONOCERA PETIOLATA.\u2014W.

Petioles 4 inches long, smooth, thickened at the base and summit. Racemes axillary, as long as the petioles; flowers pedicellate, turning one way. Calyx white, 5-leaved, leaflets lanceolate acuminate. Corolla white, 5-petaled, as long as the calyx, petals ovate lanceolate, fringed at the point, sericeous without, thickened along the middle, and covered with white hairs within, margins inflexed. Ten thick subrotund yellow glands surround the stamens. Stamina numerous (23\u201330), inserted within the glands, erect, shorter than the petals; filaments short; anthers longer, linear, bivalved at the apex, the outer valve elongated, the inner short and acute.

Ovarium inferior, 4-celled, many-seeded; about 4 seeds in each cell attached to its upper and inner angle. Style red, as long as the stamina. Stigma simple. Fruit a berry or pome.\n\nObs.\u2014The inflorescence of this tree is very remarkable, and quite different from the other species of Careya.\n\nCLERODENDRUM DIVARICATUM.\u2014W. J.\n\nDidynamia Angiospermia.\n\nFoliis obovato-lanceolatis acuminatis glabris, paniculis terminalibus erectis elongatis, pedicellis fructus reflexis, calyce subintegro fructifero, vix aucto.\n\nFound at Laye, on the West Coast of Sumatra.\n\nStem shrubby, erect, about 2 feet in height, smooth, with opposite branches, which are thickened at the joint. Leaves opposite, short petioled, obovate lanceolate, acuminate, entire, sometimes denticulate, smooth. Panicle erect, terminal, long, composed of opposite divaricate ramifications which are subdichotomous and many-flowered. Pedicels of the fruit reflexed. Bracts large ovate, acuminate, foliaceous. Calyx cup-shaped, nearly entire. Corolla tubular, limb 5-parted, secund, the lower segment longer and of a blue colour. Stamina long, exsert. Style 1. Berry deep purple, resting on the calyx, which is scarcely at all enlarged, 4-lobed, 4-seeded, from 1 to 3 seeds occasionally proving abortive.\n\nHEDYCHIUM SUMATRANUM.\u2014W. J.\n\nN. O. Scitamineae.\n\nSpica imbricata nutante, coroll\u00e6 labio bifido, laciniis oblongis divergentibus.\n\nGandasuli utan. Malay.\n\nFrom Salumah, on the West Coast of Sumatra.\n\nStem erect. Leaves alternate, short petioled on their sheaths, lanceolate, very entire, very smooth, parallel veined; above a foot in length. Sheaths smooth, prolonged into a very long ligula. Spike terminal, nodding, short, dense, strobiliform. Bracts lanceolate, as long as the calyx; within this the ovary is embraced by a tubular bract about half the length of the other.\nFlowers numerous. Calyx superior, tubular, oblique at the mouth. Corolla long, outer limb 3-parted, with long narrow segments; two segments of the interior limb much shorter and broader; the third segment or lip, which is united to the filament, bifid, the divisions narrow and diverging. Filament very long, embracing the style. Anther recurved, naked. Style length of the stamen. Stigma thick. Ovary pilose, 3-celled, several seeded. Nectarial bodies oblong.\n\nObs.\u2014This is a handsome species, and though its flowers are not so large and showy as those of the H. coronarium, this is in some degree compensated by the greater number which expand at one time. It is the first wild species I have met with in the Eastern islands.\n\nALPINIA ELATIOR.\u2014W. J.\n\nN. O. Scitamineae.\n\nScapis radicalibus elatis, spicis ovatis, corollae labio integro basi mutico, foliis basi subcordatis glabris.\n\nBunga kenchong. Malay.\n\nFound on Pulo Nias, also at Ayer Bangy on the West Coast of Sumatra.\n\nThe stems are from 5 to 8 feet high, round, somewhat compressed, smooth, striated. Leaves alternate, bifarious, petiolate on their sheaths, ovate oblong, broad, subcordate at the base, acuminate, very smooth on both sides, polished above, striated with fine parallel nerves; from 1 to 2 feet long. Ligula of the sheath rounded. Scapes, rising at a little distance from the stems, 2 or 3 feet high, erect, round, smooth, invested by sheaths which are rounded at their points and mucronate below the apex. Spikes short, thick, ovate, compact, densely covered with flowers. The lower bracts are of a fine rosy colour, large and spreading, so as to form a kind of involucre to the head; the upper bracts are shorter, imbricated, oblong or tongue-shaped, rosy with white ciliate edges, each supporting a single flower. The involucel or inner bract which embraces the ovary is tubular and irregularly bifid, being cloven more deeply on one side than the other. Calyx reddish, deeply cloven on one side, by which the three regular segments become secund. Corolla, outer limb three parted, segments nearly equal, erect, the upper one rather the largest; inner limb unilabiate, longer than the outer, lip ascending, involving the anther, deep purplish red with yellow edge, rhomboid ovate, entire, somewhat crisped at the point, without spurs or sterile filaments at the base. Stamen shorter than the lip; anther naked. Style as long as the anther. Stigma thick, triangular, anteriorly concave. Ovary sericeously pilose, 3-celled, many-seeded.\nObs.\u2014This is a very remarkable species, easily distinguished from the other Alpini\u00e6 with radical inflorescence by the great height of the scapes, and the fine rosy colour of the lower bracts.\n\nALPINIA CAPITELLATA.\u2014W. J.\n\nFoliis longe petiolatis supra glabris, racemo terminali composito, capitulis florum bracteis involucratis.\n\nIn the interior of Bencoolen.\n\nStems 4 or 5 feet high. Leaves alternate, bifarious, long petioled on their sheaths, broad lanceolate, fine pointed, entire, parallel veined, smooth above, slightly tomentose beneath. Sheaths villous near the top, terminating above the petioles in a long ciliate ligula. Raceme terminal, compound, inclining, red. Flowers in heads which are embraced by large round bracts. Calyx tubular, 3-cornered, nearly entire. Corolla, outer limb 3-parted, the upper segment fornicate; the inner limb unilabiate, of one large coloured segment. Stamen 1, anther 2-lobed, naked. Ovary tomentose, 3-celled. Style slender. Stigma concave.\n\nObs.\u2014The peculiar manner in which the involucral bracts embrace the capitulate flowers and subdivisions of the panicle forms a good distinctive character. The whole inflorescence is stiff and rigid, and wants that copiousness and richness which marks the greater part of this splendid genus.\n\nGLOBBA CILIATA.\u2014W. J.\n\nFoliis ovato-lanceolatis nervis supra pilosis, panicul\u00e2 terminali erect\u00e2, anther\u00e2 bicalcarat\u00e2.\n\nPuar amas. Malay.\n\nStem slender, erect, from 1 to 2 feet high, somewhat compressed, spotted towards the base with purple. Leaves alternate, bifarious, subsessile on their sheaths, ovate lanceolate, rounded at the base, acuminate, entire, the upper surface furnished with erect hairs disposed in lines along the principal nerves, lower surface smooth, dotted under the lens with minute papill\u00e6; about 4 inches long. Sheaths striated, smooth, ciliate along the margins, extending very little beyond the petioles, and there bifid. Panicle terminal, nearly erect, with alternate, divaricate, somewhat rigid branches, on which are disposed alternately several subsessile yellow flowers. Bracts lanceolate. Calyx trifid. Corolla orange-yellow, 2-bordered, the exterior 3-parted, of which the upper segment is largest and concave; the inner consisting of 2 smaller segments alternating with the outer ones. Lip elevated on the lower part of the filament and reflexed, emarginate, with a\npurple spot in the centre. Filament long, tubular. Anther with 2 subulate recurved horns or spurs. Style simple. Nectarial bodies long and linear. Ovary containing several ovula.\n\nObs.\u2014It is a small delicate species, growing in moist hollows on the sides of the hills and among the forests in most parts of Sumatra. The ciliary lines of hairs on the upper surface of the leaves distinguish it from most of its congeners.\n\nARISTOLOCHIA HASTATA.\u2014W. J.\n\nGynandria Hexandria. N. O. Aristolochiae.\n\nFolii hastato-trilobis glabris, racemis axillaribus, perianthio basi inflato, lamina erecta elliptica marginibus revolutis.\n\nFound at Natal on the West Coast of Sumatra.\n\nSuffrutescent. Branches long, spreading over the neighbouring shrubs, but not twining, angulate, jointed, smooth. Leaves alternate, petiolate, from 6 to 10 inches long, hastately 3-lobed, middle lobe elongated and terminating in a blunt acumen, very entire, very smooth, 5-nerved, and strongly veined. Petioles 2 inches long, thick, round, channeled above. Racemes axillary, longer than the petioles. Flowers alternate, pedicellate, somewhat distichous; rachis flexuose. Perianth superior, purplish-red, smooth without, inflated at the base into an ovate 6-angled ventricle, from which rises an ascending infundibuliform curved tube with revolute margin; lamina erect, elliptic, revolute at the sides, tomentose on the inner surface, as is also the inside of the tube. Style short, thick. Stigma orbicular, peltate, divided on the summit into 6 conical erect lobes. Anthers sessile, regularly arranged in a circle below the stigma, 6 in number, each consisting of 2 lobes which are 2-celled and deeply furrowed along the middle. (As these are not arranged by pairs, might they not with equal propriety be considered as 12 distinct 2-celled anthers?) Ovary oblong, obtusely 6-angled, 6-celled, many-seeded.\n\nObs.\u2014This is a large and very beautiful species of Aristolochia, remarkable for the size and form of its flowers. The ventricle at the base is large, and the narrow urn-like tube rises upwards with a very graceful curve. In this species the anthers might properly be considered as 12 in number, each 2-celled, as they are all arranged at equal distances round the stigma, and it seems questionable whether the genus itself ought not to be referred to Dodecandra in place of Hexandria. The arrangement of the anthers by pairs in the other species does not appear to necessitate the supposition of a deviation from the usual structure in ascribing to them 4 parallel cells in place of the more usual number of 2, nor does the analogy of other cognate genera\nfurnish anything opposed to the inference so strongly suggested by the present species.\n\nBEGONIA.\u2014LINN.\n\nThe island of Sumatra abounds with Begoni\u00e6, a tribe of plants which are chiefly found in moist shady situations at the foot of hills and in the recesses of forests. Being succulent herbs they are with difficulty preserved in herbaria, and the specimens are frequently deficient in one or other of the parts of fructification. Descriptions from the living plants in their native soil are therefore particularly desirable, and in this view the following account of the species which have fallen under my observation will not be uninteresting. They seem to differ from all those described by Mr. Dryander in the first volume of the Linnean \"Transactions,\" and no great additions have been since made to our knowledge of the genus.\n\nBEGONIA C\u00c6SPITOSA.\u2014W. J.\n\nSubacaulis, foliis inegaliter cordatis angulatis acuminatis glabris, pedunculis dichotome cymosis, capsulae alis equalibus obtusangulis v. rotundatis.\n\nAt Bencoolen.\n\nNearly stemless. Leaves petiolate, oblique, cordate at the base, with rounded slightly unequal lobes overlapping each other a little, somewhat falcate, rounded and sublobate on one side, straighter on the other, attenuated into a long acumen or point, spinulose but scarcely serrated on the margin, smooth, shining above, pale and punctato-papillose beneath; nerves 5-9, branched towards the margin. The leaves are of unequal size and vary somewhat in shape, the old ones being much rounder and more decidedly lobed than the younger ones, which have the point so much incurved as to be nearly falcate on one side. Petioles red, pilose. Peduncles often as long as the leaves, smooth, bearing a dichotomous cyme of white flowers. Bracts ovate, concave. Male.\u2014Perianth 4-leaved, the inner pair smaller. Stamina numerous, collected into a head. Female.\u2014Perianth superior, 3-leaved, 2 exterior large, subrotund, applied to each other as in the male flowers, and enclosing the third, which is much smaller and oblong. Style trifid. Stigmata lunato bifid, yellow and glanduloso-pilose. Capsule 3-winged, wings nearly equal, obtuse angled or rounded.\n\nBEGONIA ORBICULATA.\u2014W. J.\n\nSubacaulis, foliis orbiculatis cordatis crenatis glabris, pedunculis subdichotomis, capsulae alis subequalibus obtusangulis.\nInterior of Bencoolen.\n\nNearly stemless. Leaves petiolate, subrotund, from 3 to 4 inches in diameter, slightly oblique, cordate at the base where the lobes overlap each other, remotely crenate, rounded at the point, smooth, except on the nerves of the under surface, beautifully and finely punctate above. Stipules scariose, acute. Peduncles erect, subdichotomous, nearly as long as the leaves\u2014i.e., about 6 or 8 inches in height. Flowers white. Male.\u2014Corolla 4-petaled, the outer pair large, oblong; the inner small. Stamina numerous. Female.\u2014Capsule 3-celled, many-seeded, 3-winged; wings obtuse angled, nearly equal.\n\nBEGONIA SUBLOBATA.\u2014W. J.\n\nRepens, foliis cordatis subquinque-lobis vel angulatis dentato-serratis margine reflexis glabris, capsulae alis equalibus obtusangulis.\n\nFound under moist rocks on Pulo Penang, West Coast of Sumatra.\n\nRepent, with a thick knotty root. Leaves alternate, petiolate, cordate, sometimes unequally, large and broad, often 6 or 7 inches long, angulate, sometimes with 5 acute lobes, sometimes nearly ovate, acuminate, dentato-serrate, edges recurved, very smooth, 5\u20137-nerved, finely punctate, the dots appearing elevated on the upper surface and depressed on the lower. Petioles 4\u20136 inches long, nearly smooth, furnished immediately below their junction with the leaf with a semiverticil of linear acute appendices or scales. Stipules large, ovate, rather laciniate towards the apex, 1 on each side the petiole. Peduncles axillary, erect, 6\u20138 inches long, red, very smooth, terminated by a dichotomous divaricate panicle of white flowers tinged with red. Bracts roundish. Male.\u2014Perianth 4-leaved, leaflets rather thick and fleshy, the 2 outer ones much larger and subrotund, before expansion completely enclosing the inner 2, and having their edges mutually applied to each other in such a manner that they form an acute carina round the unexpanded flower. Stamina numerous, in a roundish head; filaments short, inserted on a central column which rises from the base of the flower. Anthers oblong, cells adnate to the sides of the filaments, bursting longitudinally. Female.\u2014Capsules with 3 equal obtusely angled wings, 3-celled, 3-valved, valves septiferous in the middle, sutures corresponding to the wings. Seeds numerous, attached to placent\u00e6, which project from the inner angle of the cells.\n\nObs.\u2014The serratures are hard and cartilaginous, and recurved in such a manner along with the margin of the leaf that, when only observed on the upper surface, their place is perceived by\nan indentation. It seems to resemble the B. grandis, Dryand., which differs, however, in having oblique, doubly serrated leaves and purple flowers.\n\n**BEGONIA FASCICULATA.\u2014W. J.**\n\nFoliis inferioribus alternis, superioribus oppositis, oblongo-ovatis basi semicordatis duplicato-serratis pilosis, perianthiis masculis diphyllos, capsulae alis equalibus obtusangulis.\n\nFound at Tappanuly on the West Coast of Sumatra.\n\nCaulescent. Stem weak, jointed, thickened at the joints, round, covered with red hairs. Leaves petiolate, the lower ones alternate, the upper ones opposite, oblong ovate, inequilateral, semicordate at the base, acuminate, irregularly serrate, covered above with red erect subspinescent hairs, beneath with softer and weaker hairs. Petioles densely pilose. Stipules linear, acuminate, pilose. The flowers come in fascicles from the middle of the petioles, and these flower-bearing leaves are always opposed to another without flowers; hence it is that the upper leaves are opposite, while the lower are alternate. Fascicles composed of male and female flowers; pedicels slender, smooth, white. Bracts several at the base of the fascicles, acute, pilose, red. Male.\u2014Perianth diphylous, white. Stamina numerous. Anthers yellow. Female.\u2014Perianth superior, white, cup-shaped, 5-leaved; petals ovate, acute, with a few short red hairs on the outside. Style deeply trifid; lobes convolute, infundibuliform. Capsule 3-winged, 3-celled, wings equal, obtuse-angled.\n\n**BEGONIA PILOSA.\u2014W. J.**\n\nFoliis subsessilibus irregulariter serratis acuminatis pilosis subtus rubris, bracteis ad basin pedicellorum subrotundis ciliatis, capsulae alis subequalibus parallelo rotundatis.\n\nInterior of Bencoolen.\n\nCaulescent, pilose. Leaves alternate, scarcely petiolate, ovate, inequilateral, acuminate, slightly and irregularly serrate, pilose with long red hairs, under surface of a bright red colour; about three inches long. Stipules large, lanceolate, pilose externally. Peduncles oppositifolious, subdichotomous. Bracts at the base of the pedicels, roundish, ciliate. Flowers white. Male.\u2014Corolla 4-petaled, the inner pair smaller. Stamina numerous. Female.\u2014Corolla 5-petaled; the two outer petals larger. Capsule 3-winged; wings nearly equal, parallel and rounded.\nBEGONIA BRACTEATA.\u2014W.

Leaves\nalternate, short petioled, ovate, semicordate at the base, acuminate,\nduplicato-serrate, pilose, 3-4 inches long. Stipules large, pilose.\nPeduncles oppositifolious, generally supported by a smaller leaf,\ninvested particularly towards the base with many pair of opposite\novate acute pilose ciliate bracts, which are pressed flat against\neach other; the uppermost pair is distant from the rest, and sup-\nports from 1 to 3 pedicels. Flowers white. Male.\u2014Corolla\n4-petaled; the outer two large, subrotund. Stamina numerous.\nFemale.\u2014Corolla 5-petaled; petals nearly equal. Styles three.\nStigmata lunate, villosus with yellow short glandular hairs. Capsule\nembraced by 2 bracts at the base, 3-celled, 3-winged; wings equal,\nrounded.\n\nBEGONIA RACEMOSA.\u2014W. J.\n\nFoliis obovato-oblongis irregulariter dentatis acuminatis glabris,\nracemis erectis masculis, flore feminino axillari, perianthii masculis\ndiphyllis, capsulae alis equalibus parallelo-rotundatis.\n\nInterior of Bencoolen.\n\nLayang-layang simpai. Malay.\n\nSuberect, stem smooth, jointed.

Stipules large, oblong. Racemes,\noppositifolious, long, erect, bearing numerous fasciculate male\nflowers, and having a single female one in the axil. Male.\u2014\nCorolla 2-petaled, petals very thick. Stamina numerous. Female.\n\u2014Capsule with 3 equal parallel rounded wings, 3-celled.\n\nBEGONIA GENICULATA.\u2014W.

Malay.\n\nSumatra.\n\nCaulescent, stems smooth, compressed, channelled, jointed,\nthickened at the articulations. Leaves alternate, petiolate, semi-\ncordate at the base, obovate oblong, acuminate, denticulate, smooth.\nPeduncles oppositifolious, dichotomous, divaricate, many-flowered, lower flowers female, upper male. There is often a female flower from the axil. **Male.**\u2014Perianth 2-petaled, white. Stamina numerous; anthers oblong, broader above. **Female.**\u2014Capsules long, 3-winged, wings obtuse-angled, equal, smooth.\n\n**Obs.**\u2014The leaves of this plant are used by the natives for cleaning and taking out rust from the blades of crises. It has considerable resemblance to the preceding species.\n\n**SONERILA HETEROPHYLLA.**\u2014W. J.\n\nFoliis oppositis altero minimo reniformi, altero oblongo acuminato versus basin attenuato ibique semicordato, supra glabris, pedunculis axillaribus brevissimis paucifloris.\n\nFound at Tappanuly, on the West Coast of Sumatra.\n\nStem creeping, round, covered with appressed scaly hairs. Leaves opposite, almost sessile, one very minute and reniform, the other about 3 inches long, oblong, broader above, acuminate, narrowing to the base, semicordate, the outer lobe forming a rounded auricle, obsoletely denticulate or nearly entire, a small spinule on the denticulations; 3-nerved, smooth above, whitish beneath, with some hairs on the nerves. Petioles scarce any. Flowers from the axils of the small leaves, sometimes nearly solitary, sometimes 4 or 5 on a very short peduncle. Pedicels reddish, seated on small tubercles, furnished with glandular hairs. Calyx superior, trifid. Corolla 3-petaled. Stamina 3. Capsule turbinate, 3-celled, many-seeded.\n\n**Obs.**\u2014This species is remarkable by the extreme difference in the size of the opposite leaves, one of which is so minute as almost to escape observation. The same peculiarity exists in the Sonerila Moluccana.\n\n**RHODODENDRON MALAYANUM.**\u2014W. J.\n\nFoliis oblongis glabris punctatis, floribus terminalibus, pedicellis cernuis, coroll\u00e2 punctat\u00e2 basi gibb\u00e2.\n\nObserved on the summit of the Sugar Loaf Mountain, in the interior of Bencoolen.\n\nThis is a large shrub or small tree much branched. Bark brown and spotted. Leaves alternate or scattered, short petioled, lanceolate-linear, $2\\frac{1}{2}-3$ inches long, attenuated to both ends, somewhat bluntish at the point, entire, smooth, thickly sprinkled beneath with brown dots and green above with depressed points; the middle nerve is strong, the lateral ones scarce any. Stipules none. Flowers from a short terminal bud, which is at first closely invested by numerous imbricated broad bracts, which successively fall off\nand at length leave the short thick peduncle annulated by their cicatrices. It throws out near the point several nodding 1-flowered pedicels, which are dotted in the same manner as the leaves. Calyx very small, 5-toothed. Corolla crimson, tubular, expanding into a 5-lobed limb, sprinkled with callous dots, tube gibbous at the base and marked with 5 furrows. Stamina 10, leaning to one side, inserted on the very base of the corolla and about as long as its limb; filaments red; anthers yellow, opening at top by 2 oblique pores. Style a little shorter than the stamens. Stigma a round head marked with 5 indistinct rays. Ovary superior, oblong, 5-sided, covered with brown spots, 5-celled, polysporous.\n\nObs.\u2014I found this and the following species of Vaccinium on the very summit of Gunong Bunko, a remarkable insulated mountain in the interior of Bencoolen, commonly called by Europeans the Sugar Loaf, in reference to its shape. Its elevation is not estimated to exceed 3,000 feet, yet the character of its vegetation is decidedly Alpine. This character is probably more marked than it would be at a similar height on the side of a differently shaped hill, owing to the steepness, which refuses space for large trees; and the consequent exposure and want of shelter on its sharp conical peak.\n\nVACCINIUM SUMATRANUM.\u2014W. J.\n\nRacemis axillaribus foliis brevioribus, foliis elliptico-ovatis integerrimis coriaceis.\n\nFound on the summit of Gunong Bunko, or the Sugar Loaf Mountain, in the interior of Bencoolen.\n\nA small tree, with reddish brown bark and smooth branches. Leaves alternate, short petioled, elliptic ovate, acuminate, sometimes obtuse, entire, edges a little reflexed, very smooth, firm, stiff and leathery, pale green beneath; about 4 inches long. Stipules none. Racemes axillary, shorter than the leaves, often from the stem below them. Flowers white, pedicellate, alternate. Calyx small, cup-shaped, slightly 4-toothed. Corolla oblong ovate, contracted at the mouth; limb short, recurved, 4-parted. Stamina 8 include, inserted on the base of the corolla; filaments dilated at the base, pilose, tinged with red; anthers 2-lobed, between which are 2 short filaments or processes, each lobe prolonged upwards into a membranaceous horn or awn, which is bifid at top and opens by a pore. Ovary semi-inferior, 4-celled, polysporous, ovula attached to the inner angles of the cells. Style columnar, a little longer than the stamens, include. Stigma round, obtuse.\nHALORAGIS DISTICHA.\u2014W. J.\n\nFoliis alternis distichis obliquis integris, floribus axillaribus subsolitariis, petalis tridentatis.\n\nKayo kanchil. Malay.\n\nThis species is not unfrequent in Sumatra, at Singapore, and other parts of the Malay Archipelago.\n\nA shrub with ferruginous pilose branches. Leaves alternate, distichous, arranged in two series, one of large leaves and another of very small ones which resemble stipulae, being regularly placed a little below the insertion of the large ones, so as to lie over their bases; the large leaves are subsessile, rhomboid oblong, inequilateral, acute, entire, nearly smooth above, pilose with short appressed hairs beneath; from an inch to an inch and a half long; the small leaves are similar in shape, but more acute, and little more than a quarter of an inch long; they are arranged on the anterior side of the branch and are closely appressed to it, so as to resemble stipules. Flowers axillary, generally solitary, subsessile. Calyx 4-leaved, persistent. Petals 4, shorter than the calyx, trifid. Stamina 8, as long as the petals; anthers 2-celled. Ovary inferior, 4-sided, ferruginous, 4-celled, tetrasporous. Styles 4, equal to the stamens. Stigmas simple. Drupe oblong ovate, red, containing a nut with 8 longitudinal furrows, and containing a single seed. Seed oblong oval; embryo central in an ample albumen.\n\nObs.\u2014The general habit of this species is very peculiar, and has much the character of Australasian vegetation, to which country the genus principally belongs.\n\nELODEA.\u2014ADANSON.\n\nHypericinae. Juss.\n\nThis genus, which has been revived by a late author on American Botany, appears to be abundantly distinguished from Hypericum, and to form a good natural division. It is principally characterized by having the stamens united into 3 phalanges, which alternate with an equal number of nectaries. In the following species the placentation is peculiar; I know not whether the American plants exhibit the same structure, as it is not mentioned in any description which I have seen, but if it should prove on examination that they do, it should form part of the generic character. Loureiro's Hypericum Cochinchinense, which undoubtedly belongs to Elodea, appears to be very nearly related to my E. Sumatrana, and his description of the seeds seems to indicate a structure similar to what I have observed. The Hypericum\npetiolatum of the same author seems also referable to this genus, and to be different from Linn\u00e6us's H. petiolatum, which is a native of Brazil. In all the species now referred to Elodea, the generic distinction appears to receive confirmation from certain differences of habit which may be remarked between them and the true Hyperica, particularly in the colour of the flowers, which in the latter is almost without exception yellow, but in Elodea is often red.\n\n**ELODEA SUMATRANA.\u2014W. J.**\n\nFoliis subsessilibus oblongis attenuato-acuminatis glabris rigidiusculis, paniculis terminalibus foliosis, staminibus numerosis triadelphis, petalis basi nudis.\n\nFound at Tello Dalam, in the island of Pulo Nias.\n\nA large shrub or small tree; branchlets rather compressed, obscurely 4-sided. Leaves opposite, almost sessile, oblong, tapering to the point, acute, broad at the base, entire, smooth; nerves proceeding from a middle rib, strong; 6 or 7 inches in length; the surface appears by the aid of the microscope to be dotted with opaque points. Panicles terminal, foliose, the lower divisions being axillary; oppositely branched and rigid. Flowers dark red or purple. Bracts minute. Calyx 5-leaved, persistent, leaflets ovate, smooth, the outer ones smaller. Corolla cup-shaped, longer than the calyx, 5-petaled; petals subrotund; ungules naked, without pore or scale. Nectaries 3, yellow, inserted below the corolla and half as large as the petals, subrotund, doubled backwards upon themselves in such a manner as to form a sac which opens behind near the base. Stamina numerous, their filaments united for about half their length into three phalanges, which are inserted alternately with the three nectaries; they are a little shorter than the corolla; anthers yellow, 2-celled. Ovary oblong, 3-celled, many-seeded. Styles 3, diverging. Stigmata 3, subrotund. Capsule oblong, 3-celled, each cell containing several seeds as long as the cell and attached to the bottom of the central column; they are thin and flat, disposed regularly one within the other, forming concentric circles, which are particularly apparent in the transverse section of the capsule.\n\n*Obs.*\u2014This curious arrangement of the seeds is not a little remarkable; they lie one within the other like skins of an onion, each occupying the full length and breadth of the cell, but diminishing regularly in size from the outermost to the middle in proportion to the different radius of the circle which it describes round the common centre. They are attached one above the other to the bottom of the cell at its inner angle. The leaves are destitute of pellucid dots, and have their lateral nerves strongly and distinctly marked. The nectaries which alternate with the\nstamina are very peculiar, being saccate, apparently by being doubled backwards. This species differs from the following and those of America in having no scales at the base of the petals, and from the latter in having numerous stamens. It appears to be nearly related to Loureiro's Hypericum Cochinchinense, which, as already observed, belongs to this genus.\n\n**ELODEA FORMOSA.\u2014W. J.**\n\nFoliis petiolatis lanceolatis subtus glaucis pedunculis fasciculatis axillaribus, staminibus numerosis triadelphis, nectariis acutis.\n\nKayo gaghak. *Lampong*. Sepadas Bunga. *Malay*.\n\nNative of Sumatra.\n\nA small tree with cinereous bark and smooth branchlets. Leaves opposite, elliptic oblong, acute, very entire, smooth, glaucous beneath, pellucidly punctate, two and a half inches long; the nerves proceed from a midrib. Petioles slender. Peduncles axillary, and from the axils of fallen leaves, fasciculate, 1-flowered, slender, smooth. Flowers white, with a slight rosy tinge. Bracts several at the base of the peduncles. Calyx 5-leaved, smooth, leaflets acute. Corolla 5-petaled, longer than the calyx; petals oblong, each furnished with a broad adnate scale a little above the base. Stamina numerous, united into 3 phalanges. Nectaries 3, alternating with the staminaceous fascicles, red, acute, carinate behind, fleshy. Ovary 3-celled, each cell containing several flat ovula lying one within the other, and attached by their bases to the lower part of the axis. Styles 3, long. Stigmas capitate. Capsules oblong, crowned by the persistent styles, 3-celled, many-seeded. Seeds thin, flat, attached by their bases to a central triangular column, on which they are inserted alternately in a double series.\n\n*Obs.*\u2014The arrangement of the ovula is similar to that observed in the E. Sumatrana; they are thin, attached by their bases to the lower part of the cell, suberect, and concentrically disposed, but are inserted rather higher on the axis of the cell than in the former. This species agrees with those of America in having a scale at the base of the petals, but differs in having numerous stamens; it therefore comes nearer to the E. Egyptica (Hypericum Egyptianum, Linn.).\n\n**TERNSTR\u00d6EMIA.**\n\nThe Malayan species of Ternstr\u00f6emia exhibit a remarkable agreement among themselves, at the same time that they differ considerably from the rest of the genus. They have a trilocular ovarium surmounted by 3 styles, which are inserted on the same point, but are separate to the base. In some the corolla is mono-\npetalous with monadelphous stamens, in others it is 5-petaled with distinct stamens. The anthers are 2-celled and open at the top by 2 oblique pores; this is probably the case with the whole genus, though it has been omitted in the generic character, of which it ought certainly to form an essential part. It seems doubtful whether the monogynous species with bilocular fruit and definite seeds ought to be united with those which have 3 styles, 3 cells and numerous seeds; but an examination of their ovaries and placentation is necessary to decide the question. I have met with four species in Sumatra and the adjacent islands, two of which I have already described in the first volume of the \"Malayan Miscellanies.\" Their common appellation in Malay is Ingor-ingor karbau, or Buffalo's spittle.\n\n**TERNSTR\u00c6MIA ACUMINATA.\u2014W. J.**\n\nFoliis obovato-lanceolatis acuminatis spinuloso-denticulatis glabris, floribus axillaribus solitariis polyandris, pedunculis squamosis, fructu triloculari.\n\nFound at Tappanuly on the West Coast of Sumatra.\n\nBranches round, somewhat flexuous. All the young parts green, with a few appressed scales. Leaves alternate, petiolate, obovate lanceolate, attenuated to the base, terminating in a long acumen or point, spinuloso-denticulate, smooth, with the exception of a few appressed scales on the lower surface; about a foot in length. Petioles short, scaly. Peduncles axillary, solitary, 1-flowered, scarcely so long as the petioles, covered with small scales. Calyx 5-leaved, the 3 outer leaflets with appressed scales. Corolla white, 5-petaled, little longer than the calyx. Stamina many, inserted on the base of the petals; anthers large, truncate and opening by 2 pores at the top. Ovary 3-celled, many-seeded. Styles 3.\n\nObs.\u2014This agrees with the T. pentapetala in having the corolla divided to the base, but the leaves are more acuminate, and the flowers are solitary and axillary.\n\n**TERNSTR\u00c6MIA SERRATA.\u2014W. J.**\n\nFoliis obovato-oblongis cartilagineo-serratis glabris, pedunculis axillaribus binis, floribus monadelphis, laciniis coroll\u00e6 emarginatis, fructu triloculari.\n\nFrequent on the island of Pulo Nias.\n\nA small tree. Young parts furnished with brownish scales. Leaves alternate, petiolate, obovate oblong, acuminate, serrate with irregular cartilaginous uncinate serratures, smooth, pretty strongly nerved; 7-8 inches long. Petioles brown, scaly.\nPeduncles generally 2, axillary, 1-flowered, slender, about an inch long. Calyx 5-parted, whitish, leaflets unequal. Corolla white, monopetalous, quinquefid, longer than the calyx, cup-shaped, lobes bifid or emarginate, generally oblique. Stamina shorter than the corolla, and inserted on its base; filaments united below; anthers oblong, bifid, 2-celled, each cell opening at top by an oblique cucullate pore. Ovary hairy, 3-celled, many-seeded; placent\u00e6 central. Styles 3, longer than the corolla, irregularly bent. Berry 3-celled, many-seeded. Seeds angled, foveolate.\n\nObs.\u2014This differs from the other Sumatran species in having firmer leaves, with stronger nerves and thickened callous serratures. The peduncles are more slender, the styles longer, and the lobes of the corolla obliquely notched.\n\nTERNSTR\u00c6MIA CUSPIDATA.\u2014W. J.\n\nFoliis obovato-ellipticis acuminatis dentato-serratis, serraturis, apice hamatis, fructibus 5-locularibus, pedunculis axillaribus 1\u20133 floris.\n\nA tree, young parts ferruginous. Leaves petiolate, elliptic ovate, attenuated to the base, broader above, sharply acuminate, serrated, the narrow sharp toothlets generally curved or hooked at their points, smooth, often marked with whitish glandular dots on the nerves, veins, and serratures; 6\u20138 inches long. Peduncles axillary, 1\u20133 flowered, smooth. Calyx 5-parted, segments orbicular, Corolla white, monopetalous, 5-parted. Stamina numerous; anthers opening by two gaping pores. Ovary subglobose, 5-celled, ovula very numerous; placent\u00e6 from the inner angle of the cells. Style very deeply 5-parted.\n\nObs.\u2014This species (received from Salumah during the printing of the present sheet) comes very near to the T. serrata; it differs in having the leaves more sharply acuminate, with longer tooth-like serratures, and rather shorter petioles, the peduncles frequently bearing 2 or 3 flowers, and not so slender as in the former and in the 5-celled fruit.\n\nMILLINGTONIA.\u2014ROXB.\n\nCalyx 5-phyllos, foliolis duobus exterioribus minoribus. Corolla 5-petala, petalis duobus minoribus squamiformibus. Stamina quinque, quorum tria sterilia difformia basi petalorum majorum inserta; duo fertilia basi minorum adnata, filamentis apice scyphum gerentibus cui anther\u00e6 bilob\u00e6 insident. Ovarium nectario annulari cinctum, biloculare, loculis disporis. Drupa nuce plerumque monosperm\u00e2. Embryo erectus, curvatus albumine nullo aut parco.\nObs.\u2014It will be perceived that I have made a considerable and material alteration in the terms of the generic description from that given by Roxburgh (\"Fl. Ind.\" i. p. 102), which I conceive to be necessary towards explaining the true relations of the various parts of the flower, and thereby affording the means of tracing more correctly its natural affinities. The principal point is to determine the real nature of what Roxburgh calls the nectarial scales at the base of his petals. I have no hesitation in considering them as abortive stamens, which the examination of the flower before expansion places, I think, beyond a doubt. In that state the whole of the stamens connive over the pistil, the anther of the fertile ones is turned inward, so as not to be visible, and there is no considerable difference of appearance between them and the sterile ones. The anther-bearing hollow of the fertile stamens is applied to a corresponding hollow on the side of the sterile ones, and at the time of expansion the former separate themselves with a jerk and become erect, while the latter continue in their original position incumbent over the pistil. The petals on which the fertile stamens are inserted are much smaller and narrower than the others, as if exhausted by the greater development of the parts they nourish. These petals are called by Roxburgh outer laminae of the filaments, which is contrary to all common analogy, while the other explanation might be supported by numerous examples of a similar structure. Thus in place of a diandrous flower with tripetalous appendiculate corolla and bifid stamens, we obtain 5 as the primary number of all the parts, only modified by the partial abortion of 3 of the stamens.\n\nMILLINGTONIA SUMATRANA.\u2014W. J.\n\nFoliis impari-pinnatis, foliolis 3\u20136 jugis ovato-lanceolatis, petalis minoribus acutis, fructu ovato.\n\nFound on the island of Pulo Nias.\n\nIt is a moderate-sized tree with grey bark. Leaves alternate, pinnate with an odd one which is rarely wanting; leaflets from 5 to 13, opposite, ovate, lanceolate, acuminate, entire, smooth, 6\u20139 inches long. Common petiole flat above and marginate, thickened at the base. Panicles terminal, many-flowered, rather coarctate, with stiff rigid divisions, slightly tomentose. Flowers white. Bracts minute. Calyx small, 5-leaved, the outer 2 smaller, resembling bracts. Corolla 5-petaled, the outer 3 large, subrotund, the inner 2 much smaller, lanceolate, acute. Stamina 5, inserted on the bases of the petals; 2 fertile, upon the smaller petals, with broad filaments expanding at top into a kind of cup, on which the anther rests, and to whose outer edge it is attached; the anther consists of 2 yellow lobes resembling masses of\npollen which burst transversely. The 3 sterile stamens which are inserted on the larger petals have thick filaments without anthers, but marked with an oblong cup-like cavity on each side corresponding to the cups of the fertile ones. Before expansion, the 5 stamens connive over the pistil in such a manner that the cup-like cavities are mutually applied to each other; on expansion, the fertile stamens separate with a jerk, by which the pollen is in part dispersed, and the cup becomes erect with the anther resting upon it; the other 3 never separate but remain conniving over the pistil. Ovary embraced at the base by a nectarial cup with 5 toothlets; ovate, 2-celled, each cell containing 2 ovula attached to the centre of the partition. Style short. Stigma small. Berry ovate, oblique or recurved, somewhat less than an olive, containing a single 1-seeded nut. Nut obovate oblong, acute and curved at the base, carinate along one side, and having a large umbilical hollow above the base on the other, smooth, 1-seeded. Seed obovate oblong, acute at the base, covered with a dry loose brown skin; albumen none; embryo glutinous on the surface, erect, doubled on itself. Cotyledons thin, foliaceous, large, round ovate, reflected backwards upon the radicle, and half embracing it laterally. Radicle inferior, very large, thick, pointed, extending the whole length of the seed and partly doubled up or curved at the top.\n\nObs.\u2014The cotyledons are wrapped round the embryo in such a manner as to give the whole somewhat of a chrysaloid appearance. This species has considerable resemblance to the M. pinnata of Roxburgh, but differs in having unequally pinnate leaves, with from 3 to 6 pair of leaflets, in having the smaller petals entire and acute, not tridentate, in the nectarial ring having 5 simple toothlets, not 3 bidentate angles, and in having a large ovate fruit with a smooth, not rugose nut. The abortive cell is generally observable near the umbilical foramen.\n\nLAURUS INCRASSATUS.\u2014W. J.\n\nFoliis ovato-lanceolatis venosis, pedunculis fruct\u00fbs incrassatis rubris.\n\nMachilus medius. Rumph. \"Amb.\" iii. p. 70. t. 41.\nJaring-jaring tupai. Malay.\nFound at Natal in the island of Sumatra.\n\nA tree. Leaves alternate, petiolate, ovate lanceolate or lanceolate, acuminate, entire, very smooth, with lateral nerves proceeding from a middle rib; about 5 inches long. Petioles short. Peduncles axillary or lateral near the extremity of the branches, shorter than the leaves, supporting a small panicle of flowers. In the flower these peduncles and pedicels are slender and\ndelicate, but as the fruit advances they become very much thickened, fleshy and red. Perianth 6-parted. Stamina 9, the 3 inner ones glandular at the base and somewhat villous; anthers opening by longitudinal valves. Style short. Stigma capitate, angled. Berry seated on the incrassated peduncle, and embraced at the base by the divisions of the perianth a little enlarged, about the size and shape of an olive, purple, 1-seeded. Seed oval, exalbuminous. Radicle superior, far within the edge of the cotyledons.\n\nObs.\u2014I have met with another species at Bencoolen with larger leaves, from 9 to 12 inches in length, in which the pedicels alone are thickened, the peduncles remaining unaltered. In this particular it agrees perhaps still better with Rumphius's figure than the plant above described.\n\nTETRANTHERA CORDATA.\u2014W. J.\n\nN. O.

Leaves alternate, petiolate, cordate, sometimes sinuate-cordate, varying from subrotund-ovate to oblong oval, rather acute, smooth above, tomentose beneath, nerves proceeding from a middle rib, veins transverse, subreticulate. Peduncles axillary, shorter than the leaves, bearing a raceme of involucrated umbels. Involucres 5-leaved, leaflets roundish, tomentose without, deciduous. Umbels sessile on the involucre, 4\u20137-flowered; flowers pedicelled. Male.\u2014Perianth 6-parted. Stamina 9, hairy, the inner 3 filaments furnished with large glands; anthers 4-celled.

The young parts covered with rusty down. Leaves alternate, short-petioled, oblong, generally rounded at the\nbase, attenuated upwards, acute, very entire, deep green and shining above, glaucous beneath, the adult leaves nearly smooth, the young ones furnished with short stellate pubescence on the under surface; lateral nerves simple; about 7 inches long by 2 broad. Petioles somewhat rusty, a third of an inch in length. Stipules none. Flowers 2\u20136, glomerate on a short axillary knob, pedicellate; pedicels as long as the petioles, ferruginously tomentose. A minute bract about the middle of each pedicel. Male.\u2014Perianth ferruginously tomentose without, deeply 3-parted, spreading, segments round ovate, thick; aestivation valvate. Staminate column central, slender, expanding at top into a peltate disc, whose edge is divided into 12 or 15 rays, to the lower surfaces of which are attached an equal number of 2-celled anthers. Female.\u2014Fruit axillary, generally solitary, hanging, oblong oval, considerably smaller than an olive, somewhat pulverulent and rusty, bursting into 2 valves. Nut invested by a thin aril, which is laciniate only at the top. Seed with ruminate albumen.\n\nObs.\u2014The seed has a pungent taste and slightly aromatic smell. Mr. Brown has recognized the propriety of separating Knema from Myristica.\n\nCONNARUS.\u2014LINN.\n\nThis genus, with Cnestis, has been removed by Mr. R. Brown from the Terebintaceae of Jussieu, and formed into a separate and very natural family under the name of Connaraceae. They are rather a numerous tribe in the Malay islands, and besides the following species of Connarus and Cnestis, I have to add the new genus Eurycoma, which appears to be sufficiently distinct from both the former. I am doubtful whether the species which I have referred to Cnestis really belong to that genus, as they have all smooth capsules with arilled or carunculate seeds, or whether they ought not to be separated from those whose capsules are clothed with pruriens hair. Some confusion appears also to have existed between the species of Cnestis and Connarus, the ripe capsules of the former being often solitary from the abortion of the remaining ovaries, and I am much inclined to think that Connarus santaloides, and mimosoides of Vahl in particular, are in reality species of Cnestis, a supposition which is supported by the analogy of the inflorescence, which is almost without exception terminal in Connarus and axillary in Cnestis. This distinction is of some importance between genera so nearly related.\n\nCONNARUS FERRUGINEUS.\u2014W. J.\n\nErrugineo-tomentosa, foliis pinnatis, foliolis oblongis coriaceis subtus ferruginco-villosis, paniculis terminalibus.\n\nBunga burutta. Malay.\nNative of Pulo Pinang.\n\nA small sized tree. Branches round, covered with ferruginous wool. Leaves alternate, pinnate, leaflets 9, sub-opposite, oblong lanceolate, acuminate, very entire, margins reflexed, coriaceous, green and tomentose above, ferruginously villous beneath. Petioles round, villous, thickened at the base. Stipules none. Panicles large, terminal, sometimes with a few axillary racemes. Flowers numerous, white. Bracts roundish, often curved, ferruginously villous, as well as the calyces and the whole panicle. Calyx 5-parted, laciniae erect, oblong, acute. Corolla white, sprinkled with red dots, 5-petaled, longer than the calyx, petals erect, lanceolate. Stamina 10, erect, united at the base, the alternate ones much shorter. Anthers ovate. Style shorter than the long stamens. Stigma capitate, 3-furrowed. Capsule follicular, ferruginous, rather inflated, oblique, gibbous behind, opening on one side, 1-celled, 1-seeded. Seed bean-shaped, appendiculate at the umbilicus. Umbilical appendage or caruncle large, and glandular. Embryo dicotyledonous, conform to the seed, without albumen; radicle at a distance from the umbilicus.\n\nObs.\u2014This fine species is well distinguished by its thick leathery leaves, and the ferruginous pubescence of their lower surface and of the branches and panicles.\n\nCONNARUS VILLOSA.\u2014W. J.\n\nVillosissima, foliolis 5\u20147 lanceolatis longe acuminatis supra glabris, paniculis terminalibus dense stellato-villosis ferrugineis.\n\nNative of Sumatra.\n\nThe whole plant densely and ferruginously woolly. Branches round. Leaves alternate, pinnate, leaflets 5 or 7, subopposite, oblong lanceolate, narrowing towards the base, terminating in a long acumen, entire, smooth above, villous beneath with stellate pubescence; about 6 inches long. In young leaves the upper surface is covered with deciduous pubescence. Panicles large, terminal, and from the upper axils densely villous, ferruginous. Bracts long, linear, thick, curved, villous. Calyx 5-parted, villous. Corolla 5-petaled, limb spreading. Stamina 10, united into a ring at the base, the alternate ones shorter. Ovary densely pilose with plumose hairs. Style longer than the stamens. Stigma capitate.\n\nObs.\u2014This plant is covered with denser and rougher wool than the preceding, particularly on the panicles, and the leaves are much longer, acuminate, and not coriaceous.\nCONNARUS SEMIDECANDRA.\u2014W. J.\n\nFoliis pinnatis, foliolis 3\u20145 lato-lanceolatis subtus villosiusculis, paniculis terminalibus axillaribusque villosis, filamentis alternis sterilibus.\n\nMangul, also Akar sedinka. Malay.\n\nAbundant in thickets at various places on the West Coast of Sumatra.\n\nIt is a small tree, with wrinkled bark; the young shoots and leaves are softly and ferruginously villous. Leaves alternate, pinnate; leaflets from 3\u20145, ovate lanceolate, acuminate, entire, smooth above, slightly villous beneath, nerves lucid, 3\u20144 inches long. Panicles terminal or from the upper axils, villous and brownish. Flowers numerous. Bracts small. Calyx 5-leaved, erect, reddish, tomentose. Corolla of a light blush colour, 5-petaled; petals longer than the calyx, spreading at the limb. Stamina, filaments 5, fertile, exsert; 5 alternate ones, short, sterile, all united into a ring at the base. Style somewhat shorter than the stamens. Capsule tomentose, ferruginous, follicular, 2-valved, 1-seeded. Seed with an umbilical caruncle.\n\nObs.\u2014This is one of the most common species in Sumatra, and, like all the rest of the genus, frequents thickets and copses, or what is called by the Malays \"Beiukar,\" rather than the great forests.\n\nCONNARUS GRANDIS.\u2014W. J.\n\nFoliis pinnatis, foliolis quinis ovato-lanceolatis glabris, paniculis terminalibus, capsulis magnis glabris.\n\nAt Tappanuly, in Sumatra.\n\nA moderate-sized tree. Leaves alternate, pinnate; leaflets generally 5, ovate lanceolate, acuminate, entire, smooth, 8 or 9 inches long. Panicles terminal, long, smooth. Capsules large, oblique, red, smooth, follicular, bursting on one side, 1-seeded. Seed with a large umbilical caruncle.\n\nObs.\u2014I have not seen the flowers. It has larger leaves and fruit than any other species that I have met with, and is further distinguished by the smoothness of all its parts.\n\nCONNARUS LUCIDUS.\u2014W. J.\n\nFoliis pinnatis, foliolis glaberrimis nitidis emarginato-acuminatis, paniculis terminalibus ferrugineis, calyce persistente.\n\nSumatra.\n\nA small tree, with long divaricate subscendent branches.

Stamina 10, monadelphous at the base, the alternate ones short. Style 1, longer than the stamens. Capsule obovate, less oblique than usual in the genus, embraced at the base by the enlarged persistent calyx, smooth, bursting on one side, 1-seeded. Seed attached nearly at the base, the umbilicus half embraced by the cup-shaped caruncula, which is rather smaller than usual.\n\nObs.\u2014This is a small delicate species, having smooth, shining leaves with emarginate points; the panicles are small and seldom bring more than 1 or 2 fruit to perfection.\n\nCNESTIS EMARGINATA.\u2014W. J.\n\nFoliolis 5\u20137, acuminatis apice emarginatis racemis axillaribus paucifloris, capsulis solitariis glabris, seminis umbilico caruncul\u00e2 semiamplexo.\n\nFound in the neighbourhood of Bencoolen.\n\nA small tree with weak diffuse branches. Leaves alternate, pinnate, leaflets 5\u20137, from ovate to oblong ovate, terminating in a long acumen which is emarginate at the point, entire, very smooth, the middle nerve pubescent underneath; the upper leaflet is the largest, and frequently 5 inches in length. Petiole thickened at top and bottom, almost articulate under the terminal leaflet. Racemis axillary, subsolitary, short, few-flowered. Pedicels alternate, 1-flowered; a bract at the end of each pedicel, small, tomentose as well as the peduncle. Calyx 5-parted, smooth, persistent. Corolla 5-petaled, petals oblong, acute. Stamina 10 distinct, the alternate ones shorter. Ovaries 5, smooth, with a line of hairs along the suture. Styles 5, shorter than the stamens. Stigmas emarginate. Capsule solitary, 4 ovaries aborting, embraced at the base by the thickened calyx, orange-coloured, smooth, bursting on one side, containing a single black seed. Seed furnished at the base with a cup-shaped orange-coloured fleshy caruncle which partially surrounds the umbilicus. Embryo inverse, without albumen.\n\nObs.\u2014The umbilical caruncle in this species is similar in shape and situation to that observed in the Connarus lucidus, being smaller than usual in this tribe.\n\nCNESTIS FLORIDA.\u2014W.

Vahl, anne eadem?\nFound in Sumatra and the island of Pulo Nias.\n\nA small tree, with somewhat rigid divaricate branches. Leaves alternate, pinnate, leaflets 3\u20135, sometimes solitary, oblong ovate, attenuated into a longish blunt acumen, very entire, very smooth, rather rigid, shining above, veins reticulate, about 3 inches long. Racemes axillary, fasciculate, slender, shorter than the leaves, the lower pedicels 3\u20134 flowered. Calyx almost 5-leaved, erect, tinged with red towards the base. Corolla 5-petaled. Stamina 10, distinct, nearly equal, filaments flat and broader at the base. Ovaries 5, oblong, erect. Styles 1 to each ovary. Stigmas simple. Capsule solitary, the remainder aborting, ovate, pointed towards both ends, somewhat oblique, smooth, bursting on one side, 1-seeded. Seed almost enclosed in a bright red fleshy aril, originating from the umbilicus, and in its expansion enveloping the whole seed. Albumen none. Cotyledons plano-convex, solid. Radicle remote from the umbilicus, as in Gaertner's Omphalobium.\n\nCNESTIS MIMOSOIDES.\u2014W. J.\n\nFoliis pinnatis subdecemjugis, foliolis ovato-oblongis emarginatis, seminibus arillo subinclusis.\n\nConarus mimosoides. Vahl and Willd.\n\nFound at Tappanuly.\n\nI can scarcely entertain a doubt of this being the very plant referred by Vahl to Conarus, and aptly named Mimosoides. Its analogy with the preceding is very close, having the seeds similarly enclosed in a large red aril, and the racemes axillary. I have not seen the flowers, but the four abortive ovaries are quite distinct at base of the perfect one. In all these three species only one capsule ripens, in which particular, as well as having smooth capsules and arilled seeds, they seem to differ from Cnestis.\n\nEURYCOMA.\u2014W.

Malay.\n\nFound at Tappanuly and Bencoolen, in Sumatra, and at Singapore.\nThis is a small tree, whose branches are thick, rough with the vestiges of fallen leaves and foliose at their summits. Leaves crowded at the extremity of the branches, 2 feet long, pinnated with numerous leaflets, which are oblong lanceolate, acute, very entire, very smooth, 2\u20133 inches in length. Panicles axillary, very long. Flowers male and hermaphrodite on different plants. Calyx small, 5-parted. Corolla longer than the calyx, purple, tomentose without, with glandular hairs, petals erect with inflexed margins. Stamina 5, erect, shorter than the petals, alternating with 5 pair of villous corpuscles, which are large and distinct in the male flower, very small in the hermaphrodite. Ovary 5-lobed, lobes monosporous, in the male very small and abortive. Style 1, short, curved. Stigmata 5, thick, recurved. Capsules from 3 to 5, nearly ovate, smooth, bursting on one side, 1-seeded. Seed naked (without aril or caruncle), exalbuminous.\n\nObs.\u2014The corpuscles interposed between the stamina are remarkable in the male flower, being roundish, erect, yellow bodies, with somewhat the appearance of abortive anthers; in the hermaphrodite, however, they become simple scales. The genus differs from Cnestis in the number of the stamina, the single style, and the smoothness of the capsules, and from Connarus in the number of the ovaries and stigmas, and the want of the umbilical caruncula.\n\nPERONEMA.\u2014W.

Leaves opposite, pinate, nearly 2 feet long, with 7\u20139 pair of leaflets, which are alternate or subopposite, lanceolate, attenuated to both ends, acute, somewhat recurved, entire, smooth above, canescent beneath, veins reticulate on the under surface, 8\u20139 inches long. Petioles winged, finely and delicately tomentose, wings decurrent from the insertion of the leaflets. Stipules none. The branches are crowned by a vast terminal oppositely corymbose panicle, of which the ultimate divisions are dichotomous, with a flower in the bifurcations; the whole is finely tomentose and hoary. Bracts small, acute. Flowers inconspicuous, whitish. Calyx 5-parted, segments acute, erect.\nCorolla not much longer than the calyx, limb expanding, irregular, 5-lobed, segments secund, the two upper ones diverging, the lowermost considerably longer than the rest. Stamina 2, reflexed backwards between the upper segments of the corolla, filaments subulate, thickened towards the base. Anthers long. Rudiments of 2 abortive stamens. Ovary 4-celled, ovula erect. Style rather longer than the stamens. Stigma simple, refracted. Fruit seated on the calyx, villous, dry, separating into 4 portions, each of which contains a single seed.\n\nObs.\u2014This is a valuable timber tree, the wood being hard and tough, well suited for carriage shafts, which require to combine strength and elasticity with lightness. When long buried in the earth, it is said to become petrified. The genus is related to Vitex, but is abundantly distinct therefrom.\n\nRHODAMNIA.\u2014W. J.\n\nIcosandria Monogynia. N. O.

Its Malay name is Marpuyan.\n\nThere are two varieties of this species, the one of which is larger than the other and has broader leaves, which are more decidedly tomentose below. These differences are scarcely sufficient for a specific distinction.\n\nA small tree with greyish wrinkled bark and pilose branchlets. Leaves opposite and alternate, petiolate, roundish-ovate in the large variety, and broad lanceolate in the small one, acuminate, very entire, 3-nerved, often with a less distinct pair near the margin, smooth above, somewhat hoary beneath, pubescent, particularly on the nerves, but in the small variety nearly smooth, with little more than a glaucous tinge on the under surface. Petioles short, tomentose. Stipules small, linear. Peduncles short, axillary, 1-flowered. Flowers white. Calyx tomentose, persistent. Corolla twice as long as the calyx. Stamina inserted on the calyx, almost as long as the corolla. Ovary 1-celled, containing many ovula attached to 2 parietal placent\u00e6. Style 1, erect. Berry reddish, subglobose, crowned with the calyx, 1-celled, containing a few seeds attached to the parietes, many of the ovula proving abortive.\nObs.\u2014This genus, which is nearly related to Myrtus, appears to be sufficiently distinguished by its ovary and placentation, from which, rather than from the fruit, the most important characters in this family are to be derived. It is peculiar in having 3-nerved leaves, in which particular it has a resemblance to Myrtus tomentosa, but differs widely from that species in its fruit and ovary.\n\nADINANDRA.\u2014W.

Malay.\n\nAbundant in thickets throughout Sumatra and various parts of the Malay islands.\n\nIt grows to be a small tree; the bark is dark brown, and the branches are smooth. Leaves alternate, short petioled, elliptic oblong, acute at both ends, sometimes rounded, with an obtuse acumen at top, entire or obsoletely serrate, smooth, slightly glaucous beneath, almost veinless; 3\u20134 inches long. Stipules none. Peduncles axillary, subsolitary, 1-flowered, shorter than the leaves, recurved calyx bibracteate at the base, 5-parted, segments thick, subrotund, overlapping each other. Corolla white, twice as long as the calyx, erect or conniving, 5-petaled, petals ovate oblong, broad at the base, acute. Stamina about 30, closely arranged in several circles, the inner ones shorter; filaments divisible to their bases, but closely pressed against each other, sericeously pilose, particularly on their outer side; anthers of 2 parallel lobes, adnate to the sides of the filament, which is prolonged into a mucro at the summit.

Stigma simple. Berry globose, embraced at the base by the calyx, and acuminated by the persistent style; 5-celled, many seeded.\n\nObs.\u2014In general habit and in the texture of the leaves this plant has some resemblance to Dyospyros, but differs widely in fructification.\nIXONANTHES.\u2014W.

Spikes 1\u20133, terminal, bending in an opposite direction from the leaves. Flowers crowded, sessile. Bracts lanceolate acute, much shorter than the flowers. Calyx superior, very long, tubular, gibbous on one side below, reddish and somewhat tomentose without, limb 5-parted, somewhat reflex, lacini\u00e6 acute, broader at the base. Corolla 5-petaled, white at first, becoming red after expansion, a little longer than the calyx, petals ovate oblong, acute. Stamina 10, inserted in a double series on the calyx, erect, shorter than the corolla; anthers oblong, yellow. Ovary small, oblong, 1-celled, containing 3 pendulous ovula, attached by filaments to the summit of the cell. Style green, filiform, rather longer than the stamens, adhering to or concrete with the tube of the calyx on one side along its whole length. Stigma simple. Capsule large, not crowned with the calyx, oblong, with 5 membranaceous wings, smooth, 1-celled, 1-seeded. Seed oblong, with 5 obtuse angles. Integument membranaceous, easily separated. Albumen none. Embryo conform to the seed. Cotyledons plano-convex, angled exteriorly. Radicle conical, very small.\n\nObs.\u2014The structure of the seed is here different from what generally obtains in the Combretaceae, the cotyledons being solid, not convolute.\n\nPYRRHANTHUS.\u2014W. J.\n\nDecandria Monogynia. N.O. Combretaceae.\u2014Br.\n\nCalyx 5-fidus, superus, persistens. Corolla 5-petala, calyce longior. Stamina 5\u201310, erecta, coroll\u00e2 duplo longiora.

Drupa caryophylliformis, calyce coronata; nuce oblonga monosperm\u00e2.\n\nArbor litorea inter Rhizophoras crescens; foliis crassis ad apices ramorum confertis, floribus subcorymbosis.\n\nPYRRHANTHUS LITTOREUS.\n\nMalay, Miri batu, and in Sumatra Kayu api-api.\n\nNative of Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula, growing among mangroves in salt swamps and near the mouths of rivers. It is one of the most ornamental trees that occur in these situations.\n\nIt grows to be a large tree, generally with an irregular crooked trunk. Leaves irregularly crowded at the extremities of the branches, which are rough with their persistent vestiges, subsessile, cuneiform, retuse, attenuated at the base into a very short petiole, obtusely crenate, often nearly entire, smooth, thick and fleshy, almost veinless. Stipules none. Racemes short, simple, terminal, subcorymbose. Flowers pedicellate, crowded. Bracts 2, small, acute, at the base of each flower. Calyx superior, 5-cleft, segments erect, thick, rather obtuse. Corolla crimson, 5-petaled, petals spreading, twice as long as the calyx, acute. Stamina varying in number from 5 to 10, erect, twice as long as the corolla, filaments red, subulate; anthers oblong, purple, attached by the middle. Ovary inferior, about the size and shape of a clove, 1-celled, containing from 3 to 5 ovula, which are pendulous from the top of the cell. Style 1. Berry or drupe somewhat compressed, obtusely angled, crowned by the thick persistent calyx; nut oblong, with 2 prominent angles, 1-seeded. Seed exalbuminous. Embryo inverse. Cotyledons convolute.\n\nObs.\u2014The number of the stamens is very variable, 7 is perhaps the most frequent; 5 and 6 are common, but 10, the complete number, is rare. The number of ovula varies also. The genus is most nearly related to Laguncularia of Gaertner, but seems to differ in its corolla and stamens. It has some resemblance to Kada kandel (Rheed, \"H. Mal.\" vi. p. 67, t. 37), a figure which has not, I believe, been quoted, and may possibly be another species of this genus. Kayu api-api is the name generally given to this tree in Sumatra, but is applied by Rumphius to his Mangium album (\"H. A.\" iii. p. 115, t. 66), which is a species of Avicennia, probably the A. resinifera of Forster, known in Sumatra by the name of Pelandok kayu. It appears to be distinct from A. tomentosa, having lanceolate acute leaves, white beneath, but not tomentose, and the fruit being much smaller.\nPHALERIA.\u2014W.

Bacc bilocularis, disperma. Semina exalbunosa, embryone inverso.\n\nFrutex, foliis suboppositis, floribus axillaribus.\n\nThis genus is related to the Thymel\u00e6\u00e6, but differs in having a bilocular ovary and fruit.\n\nPHALERIA CAPITATA.\u2014W. J.\n\nNative of Sumatra.\n\nA shrub with smooth branches. Leaves opposite, or subopposite, short petioled, ovate lanceolate, terminated by a long, sharp acumen, entire, very smooth, 8 inches long. Petioles thickened. Stipules none. Peduncles axillary, sometimes from the axils of fallen leaves, very short, bearing a head or umbel of sessile flowers which is embraced by an involucre composed of several oblong-ovate leaflets or bracts. Flowers large and white, resembling those of the jasmine. Perianth inferior, tube long, faux pervious, smooth, limb 4-parted, segments ovate. Stamina 8, inserted on the faux, exsert, rather long; anthers 2-lobed. Ovary embraced by a thin white nectarial cup, oblong, attenuated into a style, 2-celled, cells monosporous, ovula attached to the summit of the cell by a thread, which, passing along the back of the ovulum, is inserted into its base, so that the ovulum seems as if doubled upon its filament. Style a little shorter than the stamens. Stigma capitate, papilose. Berries crowded, somewhat pear-shaped, rounded above, acute at the base, cortical, 2-celled, 2-seeded. Seed exalbuminous, embryo inverse, cotyledons plano-convex; radicle small, superior.\n\nPTERNANDRA.\u2014W. J.\n\nOctandria Monogynia.\n\nCalyx ovatus, limbo quadridentato. Corolla 4-petala.

Bacc polysperma.\n\nHabitus Melastomarum, foliis oppositis trinerviis, floribus paniculatis.\nPTERNANDRA C\u0152RULESCENS.\n\nNative of Pulo Pinang.\n\nA large smooth shrub, with round branches. Leaves opposite, short petioled or subsessile, ovate, acuminate, tapering at the base into short petioles, very entire, very smooth; coriaceous, paler beneath, with 3 strong nerves, and 2 less conspicuous along the margins; the transverse veins are few and not prominent. Stipules none, but the petioles are connected by an interpetiolar line. Panicles oppositely corymbose, short, terminal, sometimes also from the upper axils. Peduncles 4-sided, smooth. Bracts small. Calyx united to the ovarium beneath, ovate, reticulately squamous, almost entire or obsoletely 4-toothed. Corolla blue, lighter at the margin, 4-petaled, petals ovate, acuminate, inserted into the calyx. Stamina 8, blue; filaments nearly erect, incurved at the apex. Anthers large, pointing inwards, compressed, elongated behind into an acumen or spur, cells anteriorly gibbous and bursting longitudinally. The anthers, before expansion, are turned downwards, as in the Melastom\u00e6, but their points do not reach much below the top of the ovary. Style declinate, about as long as the stamina. Stigma conical and rather obtuse. Ovary adnate to the calyx, 4-celled, polysporous, ovula attached to convex parietal placent\u00e6. Berry 4-celled, many-seeded.\n\nObs.\u2014In general habit and appearance this plant has a close resemblance to my Melastoma glauca, and at first sight appears only to differ in having smaller flowers, and leaves with less distinct nerves and veins. In the structure of the anthers, however, it differs essentially from Melastoma, and has some affinity to Memecylon; the fruit and mode of placentation differs from both. The ovary might either be considered inferior, or superior and adnate to the calyx; the analogy of Melastoma has led me to assume the latter.\n\nMEMECYLON PANICULATUM.\u2014W. J.\n\nFoliis petiolatis ovatis obtuso-acuminatis, paniculis axillaribus brachiatis.\n\nFound at Tappanuly and on Pulo Bintangor, on the West Coast of Sumatra.\n\nA large shrub, with grey bark and smooth branches. Leaves opposite, short-petioled, ovate or oblong ovate, terminating in a rather obtuse acumen, entire, very smooth, shining above, paler beneath, with pretty distinct nerves, which unite into a line near the margin; 7 or 8 inches long. Petioles short and thick. Stipules none. Panicles axillary, sometimes from the axils of fallen leaves, oppositely branched. Peduncles 4-sided, purplish; there\nis generally a single 1-flowered pedicel placed immediately below each of the principal divisions of the panicle, springing as it were from the same point. Flowers numerous, bluish. Bracts minute. Calyx nearly entire. Corolla light blue, 4-petaled, petals broad, acute. Stamina 8; filaments subulate; anthers blue, prolonged behind into a thick spur, the upper surface of which is marked with a nectariferous cavity; cells on the anterior surface perpendicular to the spur, which is nearly horizontal, bursting longitudinally. Ovary 1-celled, containing about 8 erect ovula attached to a small protuberance in the base of the cell, its disc marked with radii corresponding to the faces of the anthers, which are incurved before expansion. Style subulate. Stigma acute. Berry globular, 1-seeded. Seed erect, exalbuminous. Cotyledons peltate, hemispherical, their flat surfaces a little irregular or waved. Radicle erect, rising perpendicularly between the cotyledons to their centre, where it is inserted.\n\nObs.\u2014This peculiar structure of the embryo is different from what obtains in all the other species of Memecylon that I have examined, where the cotyledons in place of being solid and hemispherical, are foliaceous and contortuplicate.\n\nOCTAS.\u2014W.

Petioles about 3 inches long, marginate and flattened above. Racemes axillary, erect, shorter than the leaves, branched; flowers numerous, yellowish, small and inconspicuous, in small racemules or spikelets. Bracts small, acute. Calyx inferior, spreading. Corolla 4-petaled, petals longer than the calyx, ovate. Stamina 8, the alternate ones shorter. Ovary surrounded and nearly immersed in a large fleshy nectarial ring, whose sides are angled by the compression of the filaments. Style scarce any. Stigma obtuse. Drupe ovate, acute, smaller than an olive, containing a single nut. Nut 2-celled, cells unequal and dissimilar, the outer and lower crescent-shaped, and embracing the other, which is smaller, oblong and always empty; the larger cell contains a single conform seed.\n\nObs.\u2014The structure of the fruit is very peculiar; the empty cell is placed obliquely in the upper part of the nut, the fertile one is, as it were, wrapped round the other. The extreme minuteness of the ovary prevented me from satisfactorily ascertaining its structure.\n\nPETROCARYA EXCELSA.\u2014W. J.\n\nHeptandria Monogynia. N. O.

Drupe enclosed in the enlarged calyx, which becomes adnate to it and crowned by its persistent limb; obliquely ovate, about the size of a filbert. Nut smooth, 1-seeded, with an abortive cell generally above the fertile one. Seed curved, corresponding to the cell, albuminous; embryo cylindrical inverse; radicle superior, clavato-cylindrical, longer than the ligulate cotyledons.\n\nPETROCARYA SUMATRANA.\u2014W. J.\n\nFoliis elliptico-oblongis subtus canescentibus, calycis ore regulari, staminibus septem fertilibus.\n\nA tree. Branchlets pilose. Leaves alternate, short petioled, elliptic-oblong, 6\u20138 inches long, terminating in a bluntish acumen, acute at the base, entire, the adult leaves smooth above, somewhat hoary, with close short wool beneath, the younger ones covered with deciduous pubescence above, nerves prominent beneath, veins reticulate. Petioles about a quarter of an inch in length, stipules longer than the petioles, oblong, acute. Racemes axillary and terminal, shorter than the leaves, tomentose; pedicels mostly 3-flowered, divaricate. Bracts rather large, concave, at the base of the peduncles, pedicels and flowers.

Stigma capitate.\n\nObs.\u2014These two species, though nearly related, present abundant points of distinction. In the P. excelsa the leaves are\nsmaller, smoother, and less strongly nerved, while the flowers are larger, the racemes longer, more erect and compact, and the stamens longer and more numerous than in the P.

Seeds attached to the edges of the capsules, enveloped in a red aril.\n\n*Obs.\u2014This is a large forest tree, which yields excellent timber, the wood having some resemblance to oak.*\n\n**WORMIA PULCHELLA.\u2014W. J.**\n\nFoliis obovatis integerrimis, pedunculis solitariis axillaribus unifloris, floribus pentagynis.\n\nFound at Natal.\n\nA small tree. Branches round, rather smooth. Leaves alternate, petiolate, oblong obovate, rounded at top, with a short round point, sometimes retuse, very entire, very smooth, thick and rather coriaceous, about 5 inches long. Petioles smooth, channelled and marginate above, less than an inch in length. Peduncles axillary and subterminal, solitary, 1-flowered, angled, about 2 inches long. Bracts none. Calyx 5-leaved, leaflets subrotund, smooth. Corolla 5-petaled. Stamina numerous. Ovaries 5, collected into a globe, terminating in as many flat, reflexed diverging styles. Stigmas thickened. Capsules 5, of a light semi-transparent rose-colour, bursting at their angles, and then spreading like a corolla. Seeds attached to the inner edges of the\ncapsules, a few only coming to perfection, partly embraced by a red pulpy aril, which originates from the umbilicus.\n\nObs.\u2014This species is very beautiful when in fruit, from the delicacy of the colours which the capsules exhibit.\n\nFICUS OVOIDEA.\u2014W. J.\n\nFoliis cuneato-obovatis apice rotundatis, nervo medio dichotomo, fructibus axillaribus binis pedunculatis.\n\nFound at Singapore, and on several parts of the West Coast of Sumatra and its islands.\n\nA small tree, with smooth brownish bark. Leaves alternate, petiolate, cuneato-obovate, rounded above, attenuated to the base, very entire, very smooth, the middle nerve dichotomous; from $1\\frac{1}{2}$ to 2 inches long. Petioles nearly half an inch long, round, with a slight furrow above, and covered with grey bark like the branchlets. Peduncles in pairs, sometimes solitary, axillary, shorter than the petioles, 1-flowered. Involucres embraced at the base by 3 short subrotund bracts, nearly globose, smooth, shut at the mouth by scales, and containing numerous pedicellate florets. Seeds naked, hard.\n\nObs.\u2014The leaves are peculiar in having the middle nerve dichotomous, a character by which this species may be readily distinguished from its congeners.\n\nFICUS DELTOIDEA.\u2014W. J.\n\nFoliis obcuneato-deltoideis apice latis v. retusis, nervo medio dichotomo, fructibus axillaribus binis pedunculatis.\n\nA small tree, native of Sumatra, and very similar to the preceding, but having the leaves proportionally broader, more decidedly deltoid, and retuse or truncate, not rounded at top; the peduncles also are in pairs from the axils of the leaves and longer than the petioles. The breadth of the leaves is generally greater than their length in this species, which is not the case with their preceding; they are, however, precisely similar in their leathery texture, and in having the nerve dichotomous and not prominent.\n\nFICUS RIGIDA.\u2014W. J.\n\nFoliis ovatis lineari-acuminatis rigidis, fructibus pedunculatis axillaribus globosis glabris.\n\nSeribulan. Malay.\nSumatra, &c.\n\nA tree, with grey cinereous bark and smooth branchlets.\nLeaves alternate, petiolate, ovate or obovate, with long linear acumina which are obtuse or emarginate at the point, attenuated to the base, 3\u20134 inches long, entire, firm and rigid, smooth, shining above, rugose, with reticulate veins beneath; nerves prominent beneath, the lowermost pair springing from the base and running along the margins until they anastomose with the upper ones. Petioles brown with cracked skin. Berries 1\u20133, axillary, pedicelled, pedicels shorter than the petioles, smooth. Involuca globose, orange-coloured when ripe, smooth, with some whitish spots as large as a currant. Florets numerous, pedicellate. Female ones with a 4\u20135-parted perianth. Style inserted laterally. Seed naked.\n\nObs.\u2014The bark of this species is fibrous, and I am informed that it is employed in Menangkabau in the fabrication of a coarse kind of paper.\n\nJONESIA.\u2014Roxb.\n\nN. O.

Legumen oligospermum.\n\nFrutices, foliis abrupte pinnatis, floribus fasciculatis.\n\nThe alteration I have here made in the terms of the generic description from that given by Roxburgh will remove all obscurity as to the true affinities of this genus, and establish its near relation to Macrolobium. The bracteal leaflets (the diphylloous calyx of Roxburgh) are found in both genera, though less conspicuous and not coloured in Macrolobium, the stamens are similarly inserted on the mouth of the tubular calyx, and are equally variable in number; the pedicel of the ovary is accrete to the calyx in both, and the only difference consists in the presence or absence of the single petal which is found in Macrolobium and is wanting in Jonesia.\n\nJONESIA DECLINATA.\u2014W. J.\n\nFoliis 6\u20138 jugis, foliolis oblongis, floribus fasciculato-paniculatis tetrandris.\n\nKayu siturun. Malay.\n\nA small straggling tree found generally in thickets; native of Sumatra.\n\nBranches depending, whence the native name. Leaves alternate, composed of from 6 to 8 pair of leaflets, of which the lowest are situated on the base of the petiole; they are opposite, from 10 to 12 inches in length, oblong, rounded at the extremity, but terminating in a short thick recurved point, entire on the margin, smooth. Petiole roundish, thickened at the base. Stipule intra-\npetiolar, embracing the stem, broad at the base, ovate and pointed. Flowers in lateral fasciculate panicles, 2 subrotund bracts below each flower. Pedicels slender, the whole very smooth and delicate, and of a light semi-transparent red colour. Calyx reddish yellow, tubular; tube narrow; limb 4-parted, flat, segments subrotund, about the same size as the bracts. Corolla none. Stamina 4, more than twice the length of the calyx and inserted on its tube, their upper part deep red. Anthers deep purple, subrotund, 2-celled, each cell streaked with white. There are no rudiments of abortive stamens. Germen pedicellate, pedicel accrete to the tube of the calyx. Style long, red. Stigma round. Legume pedicellate, flat, compressed, containing several seeds.\n\nThe large branches of delicate flesh-coloured flowers render this a very beautiful shrub during the period of inflorescence.\n\nBAUHINIA EMARGINATA.\u2014W. J.\n\nFoliis cordatis subrotundo-ovalibus glaberrinis acumine brevi obtuso emarginato, floribus octandris, staminibus tribus superioribus fertilibus.\n\nDad\u00e2ub. Malay.\n\nNative of Sumatra.\n\nA strong woody climber. Leaves alternate, petiolate, cordate, subrotund oval, terminating in a short blunt emarginate acumen, very entire, 4 inches long, 7\u20139 nerved with reticulate veins, very smooth. Petioles rather short. Cinhi long, simple, revolute. Racemes terminal or sometimes lateral, corymbose, many flowered; pedicels long, tomentose. Calyx 5-parted, tomentose, bursting into 2 or 3 segments. Corolla large, 5-petaled, spreading, petals nearly equal, unguiculate. Stamina 8; 3 superior fertile, longer, with large 2-lobed anthers; 4 inferior short, with small abortive anthers; the fifth and lowest being a little longer, and entirely sterile. Ovary tomentose. Style about the length of the fertile stamina. Stigma peltate, round.\n\nObs.\u2014The form of the leaf is very peculiar, and readily distinguishes this species from the others.\n\nBAUHINIA BIDENTATA.\u2014W. J.\n\nFoliis cordatis acuminatis apice bidentatis glaberrimis, corymbis terminalibus, floribus octandris, staminibus tribus superioribus fertilibus.\n\nNative of the Malayan forests, where it climbs over trees, and shows its flame-coloured blossoms on their very summits.\n\nShrubby, climbing far over the trees in its neighbourhood; bark brown; branches round, flexuose; branchlets covered with ferruginous tomentum. Leaves alternate, petiolate, cordate, acute,\nbifid at the point (not 2-lobed), divisions approximate, with a short thread interposed, very entire, 7-nerved, very smooth, the younger ones rather silky beneath with ferruginous deciduous hairs. Petioles thickened at the top and base. Tendrils simple, revolute. Corymbs terminal. Pedicels clavate, striated, tomentose. Calyx 5-parted, tomentose, for the most part bursting irregularly into three divisions. Corolla orange-coloured, becoming red after expansion, 5-petaled, petals nearly equal, subrotund, unguiculate, spreading. Stamina 8, ascending, of which the 3 upper are longer and fertile, and the 3 lowest short and sterile. Anthers subrotund. Ovary pedicellate, compressed, oblong, containing from 6\u20138 ovula. Style declinate, incurved at the point. Stigma large, capitate and glutinous.\n\nObs.\u2014This species is at once distinguished by the peculiar form of the leaves, which are not 2-lobed as usual in the genus, but have the apex divided so as to make the leaf terminate in 2 acute points. The flowers are large and showy.\n\nINGA BUBALINA.\u2014W. J.\n\nN. O.

Malay.\nSumatra, &c.\n\nA tree, unarmed, with grey bark. Leaves alternate, conjugato pinnate, leaflets 2-paired, ovate, with rather an obtuse acumen, very entire, very smooth, nerves lucid, the upper pair of leaflets the largest. Primary petiole short, thickened at the base, bearing a gland at the point, secondary petioles without glands. Capitula few-flowered, panicle. Panicles axillary and terminal, peduncled, divaricate, shorter than the leaves. Bracts small. Calyx short, tubular, 5-dentate. Corolla white, much longer than the calyx, campanulate, 5-parted, segments spreading. Stamina many, monadelphous at the base, long and white. Style filiform, as long as the stamens. Ovary pedicellate. Legume dark green, straight, cylindrical, about 4 inches long, thick, obtuse, many-seeded, fetid. Seeds crowded, orbicular, piled one above the other and thus flattened above and below by their mutual compression.\n\nObs.\u2014This species is nearly allied in habit and inflorescence to the Inga Jiringa (\"Mal. Misc.\" vol. i.), but differs in the shape of the legume, which has a very offensive smell, but is eaten by the natives in the same manner as that of the Petek (Acacia graveolens, W. J.). Karbau in Malay signifies the Buffalo, whence the specific name.\nINGA CLYPEARIA.\u2014W.

Leaves alternate, bipinnate; pinnae about 4 pair; leaflets about 10 pair, rhomboidal, inequilateral, rather acute, entire, smooth above, tomentose or silky and glaucous beneath, they are of unequal size, the uppermost often 2 inches long. Petiole or rachis acutely 4 or 5 angled, thickened at the base, eglandular. Panicles large, terminal; peduncles fascicled. Flowers white, pedicellate, in small capitula or heads. Calyx small, 5-parted. Corolla much longer than the calyx, quinquefid. Stamina numerous, monadelphous at the base. Style one. Legume red, flat, 2-valved, spirally contorted, containing many subrotund somewhat compressed black seeds.\n\nObs.\u2014This species, which agrees with that described by Rumphius, is found in forests in the neighbourhood of Bencoolen, but I am not aware that it is there put to any particular use. These two species, together with the I. Jiringa, might perhaps with equal propriety be referred to Acacia, as the seeds are not arilled, though the legume (as in I. bubalina) is fleshy and esculent; the stamens are those of Inga and the paniculate inflorescence is more frequent in that genus than in Acacia. The distinction between these two sections of the Linnean genus Mimosa is an artificial one, and the characters of the present species are in some degree intermediate between the two.\n\nTABERN\u00c6MONTANA MACROCARPA.\u2014W.

Follicles 2, baccate, as large as citrons, red, diverging, subglobose, exuding a milky juice when cut, with a ridge along the middle and one at each side which unite in a short blunt point, 1-celled, many-seeded; the cell is recurved into the form of a crescent. Seeds contained in red fleshy arils or lobules which are angled by mutual compression, oblong, chrysaloid, hollowed on the one side with incurved rounded edges, convex on the other and longitudinally corrugated. Embryo contained in a conform albumen; cotyledons flat, round, cordate; radicle centripetal, cylindrical, longer than the cotyledons.\n\nFAGR\u00c6A CARNOSA.\u2014W.

Berry as large as a small egg, seated on the persistent calyx, ovate, rather pointed, 2-celled, many-seeded; seeds nidulant.\n\nObs.\u2014This is the fifth species of Fagrea that I have met with in the Malay Islands; the others have been already described in Roxburgh\u2019s \u201cFlora Indica.\u201d The F. racemosa grows to be a small tree, and the F. volubilis, doubtfully proposed by Dr. Wallich as a distinct species, is the same plant. The F. auriculata is a large shrub, and from the size of its flowers is the most splendid of the genus. I originally met with it at Singapore, but have since found it also at Tappanuly. The following particulars may be added to the description given by Dr. Wallich.\n\nF. Auriculata.\u2014Flowers terminal, generally 3, rarely 5, on short thick pedicels, each embraced by 4 opposite calyculate bracts, of which the outer 2 are the smallest.

Fronds pinnate, leaflets linear, acuminate, reflexed at the edges so as to make the upper surface convex, smooth, with a few brownish scales on the middle nerve of the younger ones; they diminish in size to the top of the frond and the last 2 are partly united at their base. Stipes of the frond scaly while young, compressed, grooved above, the sheaths armed like the trunk. Spadix within the sheath of the frond, embracing the stem, flattened at the base, much branched; flower bearing branchlets about 2 feet long, drooping, the lower ones 3\u20134 together, the uppermost solitary or in pairs. Spathe single, completely enclosing the spadix before expansion, compressed, 2-edged, deciduous, partial spathes none.

Rumph. \"Amb.\" iii. p. 167. t. 106.\n\nNot unfrequent on hills in Sumatra and the Malay Islands.\n\nA large shrub. I have not met with any that had attained to so great a size as mentioned by Rumphius. The leaves are arranged\nin a kind of irregular verticils at different distances along the branches, as exhibited in the figure quoted; on the young shoots they are sometimes irregularly disposed along the whole length; they are petiolate, lanceolate, acuminate, very entire, very smooth, firm and somewhat leathery, of various length, generally about 6 inches long by $2\\frac{1}{2}$ broad. Petioles from 1 to $2\\frac{1}{2}$ inches long, flattened above, striated. Spikes from among the upper verticils of leaves, bearing both male and female flowers, the former lowermost, all pedicellate. Calyx 5-parted. Corolla purple towards the centre, 5-parted, furnished with 10 callous nectaries or glands at the base. In the male the filament is columnar, bearing 10 anthers which diverge in a radiated circle round the summit. The female has a 3-lobed ovary surmounted by 3 styles with bifid stigmata.\n\nObs.\u2014There can be little doubt of the identity of this plant with Rumphius's Arbor spiculorum, of which he says he was never able to procure the flower. I have seen great numbers of these plants in the woods, but only once was successful in observing the flower, and have never met with the fruit. As the spike, however, fortunately contained both male and female flowers, its characters have been sufficiently determined to assign its proper place. It comes nearest to Cluytia, but differs in the corolla and in having 10 anthers with filaments united into a central column. Both its fructification and habit appear to distinguish it from all the present genera of the Euphorbiaceous family.\n\nANTIDESMA FRUTESCENS.\u2014W.

Stipules long, subulate, acute. Racemes axillary and terminal, geminate and solitary, somewhat panicled, tomentose; when geminate, the outer raceme is simple, and the inner branched; male racemes generally longer than the leaves, female ones shorter. Pedicels solitary. Bracts shorter than the pedicels. Male.\u2014Calyx 5-parted, tomentose. Nectary of 5 yellow pilose glands alternating with the stamina. Stamina 5; filaments much longer than the calyx; anthers bifid, cells bursting transversely on the summits of the lobes. Pistil abortive, pilose. Female.\u2014Perianth 5-parted. Ovary superior, villous, oblong ovate, compressed, 1-celled, ves-\ncular, containing 2 ovula, which are attached close together to one side near the top, and hang forward into the cell, which is in great part empty and inflated. Styles 2, often bifid. Drupe subglobose, purplish, about the size of a peppercorn; nut 1-2 seeded.\n\nObs.\u2014It has considerable resemblance to Roxburgh's A. pubescens; that, however, is a tree, while this is a small shrub. The most important difference appears to be in the nectary of the male flower.\n\nSALACIA.\u2014LINN.\n\nThis genus seems to require a little elucidation. It was originally referred to Gynandria, the fleshy nectary on which the stamens are inserted, having been mistaken for the germen; and the real ovary, on account of its smallness, having escaped the observation of Linn\u00e6us and Loureiro. This is now, I believe, generally admitted; there can therefore be no doubt of the identity of Roxburgh's Johnia with Salacia, and his I. salacioides agrees so well with S. chinensis, particularly in having entire leaves, that it is questionable whether they are not the same, for it is to be observed that in most of the species the leaves are only subopposite and may occasionally on the same tree be found both opposite and alternate. Tonsella prinoides (Willd. \"Berl. Ges. Nat. Fr. Mag.\" iv.) is also without doubt a true species of Salacia, if it be not in fact the same plant as the Johnia Coromandeliana (Roxb. \"Flor. Ind.\" i. p. 173). Calypso salacioides of Aubert du Petit Thouars agrees exactly with these in the structure of the flower but differs in having many-seeded berries. Some of the species of Tonsella appear likewise to have polyspermous fruit, but those which have definite seeds are probably true species of Salacia. It may be questioned whether the distinction founded on the number of seeds be really of generic value where the agreement is so exact in all other respects, especially if it should be found that a gradation exists from the one to the other in the fruit of the different species. This, however, can only be determined by an accurate examination of the ovaries and fruit of the various plants, at present ranged under Tonsella.\n\nIn the natural arrangement Salacia undoubtedly bears the greatest affinity to Hippocratea, it being scarcely possible to distinguish the two genera when only in flower. It also agrees in many particulars with the Celastrin\u00e6, but differs in having exalbuminous seeds. The union of the Hippocratice\u00e6 and Celastrin\u00e6 has, however, been suggested by Mr. Brown in his remarks on the Botany of Terra Australis. Under the above view the genus will be characterized as follows:\n\nCalyx inferus 5-fidus. Corolla 5-petala. Stamina, 3, disco\ncarnoso inserta. Ovarium 3-loculare, loculis 1\u20132 sporis, ovulis axi affixis. Bacc\u00e6 1\u20133 sperma.\n\nFrutices vel arbuscul\u00e6, foliis suboppositis simplicibus.\n\nI have met with 2 species in Sumatra, 1 with anthers sessile on the nectary, which agrees very nearly both with S. chinensis and Roxburgh\u2019s I. salacioides; the other with anthers supported on filaments and nearly related to I. Coromandeliana Roxb.\n\nVITIS RACEMIFERA.\u2014W. J.\n\nTetandra, foliis quinatis, foliolis spinescenti-serratis subtus incanis, cirris oppositifolis racemiferis, racemis compositis longissimis, baccis dispermis.\n\nAkar charikan, or Bayur akar. Malay.\n\nNative of Sumatra.\n\nA large, strong, woody climber. Branches round, villous. Leaves alternate, quinate, leaflets pedicellate, oblong obovate, acute, subspinoso-serrate, the serratures being formed by the spinoscent termination of the nerves, smooth above, hoary beneath, frequently with a ferruginous shade. Petioles villous. Cirri opposed to the leaves, very long, simple or bifid, when bifid 1 branch becomes the peduncle. Racemes very long, compound, consisting of numerous densely flowered racemuli inserted on a peduncle formed of the thickened tendril. The whole raceme is often a foot and a half in length. Peduncles ferruginously villous. Flowers sessile on the partial peduncles, small, green. Calyx minute, embracing the base of the corolla, quadridentate. Corolla deeply 4-parted. Stamina 4, anthers yellow. Ovary surrounded by a fleshy ring, tetrasporous. Style scarce any. Stigma thick, Berry of the shape of an olive and nearly as large, purple, juicy, 2-seeded.\n\nObs.\u2014This would be a species of Cissus according to the Linnean division, but that genus has now been united to Vitis by Mr. Brown, as they differ in nothing but the number of parts.\n\nRHOPALA OVATA.\u2014W. J.\n\nFoliis subsessilibus ovatis utrinque acutis integerrinis, pedicellis brevissimis cum calycibus ovariisque levissime tomentosis.\n\nFound at Tappanuly.\n\nA small tree. Leaves alternate and opposite, almost sessile, broad ovate, acute, sometimes acuminate, entire with revolute edges, very smooth, nerves distinct; 10 inches long by 6 broad. Petiole none, save the thickened base of the middle nerve. Racemes below the leaves from former axils. Pedicels 2-flowered; a bract at the base of each and at the subdivisions. Perianth, together with the pedicels, slightly tomentose or nearly smooth. Nectarial scales 4.\nLINOCIERA ODORATA.\u2014W. J.\n\nDiandria Monogynia. N. O. Oleinae.\n\nFoliis lanceolatis utrinque acutis glaberrimis, paniculis axillari-\nbus foliis brevioribus.\n\nAt Natal and on Pulo Mosella.\n\nA large shrub, with subdichotomous branches. Leaves sub-\nopposite, short-petioled, oblong-lanceolate, acute at both ends,\nentire, smooth and coriaceous; 4\u20135 inches long. Panicles axil-\nlary, opposite, much shorter than the leaves; peduncles opposite,\n3\u20135 flowered. Flowers subsessile, fragrant. Bracts small, oblong,\nCalyx 4-parted. Corolla white, almost 4-petaled, petals long,\nlinear, united by pairs, by means of the filaments, slightly coher-\ning at the other divisions. Stamina 2; anthers large, emarginate\nat the apex. Ovary 2-celled, each cell containing 2 linear pen-\ndulous parallel ovula. Style scarce any. Stigma bifid.\n\nThe following species have been discovered since the printing\nof this paper, and may be here briefly noticed:\n\nADINANDRA SYLVESTRIS.\u2014W.

Probably the name means \"monkey's kite,\" referring to the round capsules of the female. It is common for Malays to give names of this kind to plants. Filet calls it Diploclinium racemosum.\n\nBegonia geniculata, B. isoptera, Jack.
