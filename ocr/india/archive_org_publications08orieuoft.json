To that generosity is due the publication of this translation of B\u0101\u1e47a's old historical romance.\nPREFACE.\n\nTHE book of which an English translation is now for the first time presented to those who are interested in Hindu literature and antiquities, appears to have been almost forgotten in India. One writer on rhetoric mentions it by name in his S\u0101hityadarpa\u1e47a as an example of the kind of prose composition called \u0100khy\u0101yik\u0101, and a verse passage is quoted from it in the older treatise on rhetoric, the K\u0101vyaprak\u0101\u1e63a; yet few native scholars had seen it for many years, although rare copies did linger unknown in some native libraries. Professor FitzEdward Hall first introduced it to the knowledge of European Orientalists in the Introduction to his edition of Subandhu's V\u0101savadatt\u0101, published at Calcutta in the Bibliotheca Indica in 1859; he discovered three MSS. more or less complete. An edition with an excellent Commentary was published at Jammu in Kashmir in 1879 (Samvat 1936), and this was reprinted with some variations in Bombay A.D. 1892 (\u00c7aka 1814), and an independent edition of the text appeared in Calcutta in 1883, prepared by Pandit Vidy\u0101s\u0101gar. Professor F\u00fchrer has promised a new edition of the text from a careful collation of all the MSS. available in India, but his numerous engagements in connection with the Lucknow Museum have hitherto hindered him in carrying his undertaking to completion. We have had to do our best with the imperfect materials at our command, and we shall mention at the close of this preface\nthe additional help which we have received in our task from other quarters.\n\nThe great merit of the Har\u1e63a-carita consists in the fact that it is a very early attempt at an historical romance. B\u0101\u1e47a\u2019s other work, the K\u0101dambar\u012b\u00b9, and Subandhu\u2019s V\u0101savadatt\u0101 deal with mythological fiction, and everything is viewed through a highly poetical atmosphere; and the Da\u1e47\u1e0da-kum\u0101ra-carita is equally based on pure imagination, although its characters, as in the picaresco literature of modern Europe, are the exaggerated pictures of the vulgar rogues and ruffians of every great city. But the author of the Har\u1e63a-carita has taken his own sovereign as his hero and has woven the story out of the actual events of his reign. The narrative can be often illustrated by contemporary inscriptions,\u2014in fact it is as much based on real events as Scott\u2019s Quentin Durward or Waverley. This gives to it a peculiar character which distinguishes it from all other works of Sanskrit literature. In studying any other classical Sanskrit writing we are generally obliged to infer the date of its composition by a careful examination of the accidental allusions or the peculiar words and phrases which it may contain, or by tracing the earliest quotations from it in subsequent authors; it is the special interest of the Har\u1e63a-carita that it treats of a period, which happens to be almost as familiar to the student of Indian history as the reign of any of the early Muhammadan monarchs of Northern India.\n\n\u00c7r\u012b-har\u1e63a, who gives his name to the story, was the ruler at whose court the Chinese Buddhist traveller Hiuen Thsang for a time resided, who has left us such a precious description of India as he actually saw it in the early part of the seventh century (A.D. 630\u2014644); and, fortunately for us, \u00c7r\u012b-har\u1e63a was a king who well deserved to have this strong light thrown upon his reign. He was the Akbar of the \u2018Hindu period\u2019 of Indian history; and under his wise toleration the adherents of\n\n\u00b9 Translated by Miss Ridding in the present series.\nthe contending religions, Brahmanism and Buddhism, seemed to forget their rivalries in a common feeling of loyalty, just as Rajputs and Muhammadans served Akbar with equal devotion. The one great difference is that Akbar's reign is presented to us in broad daylight by such full contemporary narratives as those of Ab\u016b'l Fa\u1e93l and \u2019Abd-ul-K\u0101dir Bad\u0101\u016bn\u012b, which give us a detailed account of every great event and biographical notices of all the leading personages of the time; while we learn the events of \u00c7ri-har\u1e63a's reign only by the passing allusions of the Chinese visitor or the brief records of some inscription. Now here our romance comes in to supply a living and contemporary picture, wherein we can see something of the India of that time, just as we see in Arrian and Plutarch something of the India of Alexander's time; but we long in vain for some chronicler who would have filled in the imperfect sketch with a thousand details now for ever lost.\n\nB\u0101\u1e47a's style resembles the estilo culto of Spanish literature; it abounds with double meanings in the words and veiled allusions in the sentences, so that the reader is apt to be bewildered by the dazzling coruscations which keep flashing across his path\u00b9. Most of these puns and under-meanings refer to mythological stories, or well-known poetical superstitions like the parted ruddy-geese on the opposite banks of a river, or the cakora's red eyes at the sight of poison; but some of them undoubtedly refer also to the events of his time and can only be unriddled now by patient research and critical insight. Thus Hofrath Prof. B\u00fchler has shewn that in p. 76 the words at first sight might seem to mean only \"that the supreme Lord (\u00c7iva) took\n\n\u00b9 We have tried to preserve this characteristic feature of our author's style by continually explaining the puns in our notes; but we have often omitted them out of consideration to the English reader. Many of these will be found in the 'Additional Notes and Corrections' in Appendix B. Appendix A. also contains two long descriptions omitted from the text.\nthe hand of Durg\u0101 the daughter of the snowy mountain\"; but under this mythological allusion is concealed a reference to a contemporary conquest, since the words may be also translated, \"in our monarch a supreme lord has taken tribute from an inaccessible land of snowy mountains\"; and there are several similar allusions to the king's exploits in the same passage. Prof. B\u00fchler remarks that the inscriptions of Am\u00e7uvarman (three of which are dated Samvat 34 and 39) prove that the \u00c7r\u012b-har\u1e63a era was introduced into Nepal during the lifetime of the great King of Th\u0101nesar and Kanoj, who held the whole of Northern India from 606 to 648 A.D.\n\n\"If an Indian prince adopts a new foreign era, especially one founded by a contemporary, that may be considered as almost a certain proof that the borrower had to submit to the \u00c7aka-kart\u1e5bi or establisher of the era.\" Similarly in p. 57 where we have a description of Har\u1e63a's reluctance to become king, till the Goddess of the Royal prosperity herself forced him to mount the throne, in spite of his previous vow of austerity,\u2014we are at once reminded of Hiuen Thsang's story that Har\u1e63a at the advice of a Bodhisattva, refrained from mounting the simh\u0101sana. So too in p. 168 where \"the rising clear-flecked moon (\u00e7a\u00e7\u0101\u1e45ka) shone like the pointed hump of \u00c7iva's tame bull, when blotted by mud scattered by his broad horns,\" the commentator himself supplies us with the allusion, as he tells us in his note on the opening verses of chap. vi., that \u00c7a\u00e7\u0101\u1e45ka was the name of the dishonoured Gau\u1e0da king against whom Har\u1e63a was marching. Hiuen Thsang states that R\u0101jyavardhana was treacherously killed by \u00c7a\u00e7\u0101mka (Che-chang-kia), the ruler of Karn\u0101suvar\u1e47a in Eastern India.\n\nBut beside these veiled historical allusions, the work has another interest from the vivid picture which it offers of the condition of Indian society and the manners and customs of the period. B\u0101\u1e47a is not a mere rhetorician; his descriptions\n\n---\n\n1 *Ind. Ant.* xix. 40.\nof court and village life abound with masterly touches which hold up the mirror to the time. Not even the Pali J\u0101takas introduce us more directly into the very heart of the period or give us a more life-like picture. The court, the camp, the quiet villages, which then, as now, contained the great mass of the population, and the still more quiet monasteries and retreats, whether of Brahmans or Buddhists, are all painted with singular power; and his narrative illustrates and supplements the Chinese traveller's journal at every turn.\n\nThe first chapter gives the mythological history of B\u0101\u1e47a's family, the Brahmanical V\u0101tsy\u0101yanas, until we come to his own birth and education, and his spending some years in travel partly for pleasure and partly to acquire learning. At length he returns, to his home P\u1e5bitik\u016b\u1e6da on the Sone, where after a while he receives (ch. 2) a summons from King Har\u1e63a's half-brother, that he should repair to the court and renew an intimacy which had been interrupted by some former acts of indiscretion. He obeys the request and repairs to the royal camp near the Ajiravat\u012b river (on which \u00c7r\u0101vast\u012b stood, though it is not alluded to). The King at first receives him coldly, but B\u0101\u1e47a soon makes his way and becomes a favourite. After a while (ch. 3) he revisits his home at the beginning of autumn, and at the request of his cousins proceeds to relate the history of the King's reign. This narrative fills the remainder of the book (pp. 79\u2014260), and is left unfinished at the end of the eighth chapter.\n\nPrabh\u0101kara-vardhana\u00b9, the king of Th\u0101nesar, had, by his queen Ya\u00e7ovat\u012b, two sons R\u0101jyavardhana\u00b2 and Har\u1e63a, and a daughter Rajya\u00e7r\u012b, who was married to Grahavarman\u00b3, the\n\n\u00b9 Prabh\u0101karavardhana is described as \"a most devout worshipper of the Sun\" in the Sonpat Inscription.\n\u00b2 R\u0101jyavardhana is described in the Madhuban inscription as \"a most devout worshipper of Sugata.\"\n\u00b3 The genealogy would seem to be Grahavarman, Avantivarman (infra. p. 122), Susthitavarman, \u00c7arvavarman, I\u00e7anavarman, I\u00e7avara-varman, \u0100dityavarman, Harivarman; cf. the inscriptions Nos. 42, 46,\nson of the Mukhara king of Kanyakubja. The king dies while his elder son is absent on an expedition against the H\u016b\u1e47as, but the prince returns at his brother's earnest summons; and in his overwhelming grief, he determines to become an ascetic and to leave the throne to Har\u1e63a. At this moment, however, tidings arrive that Grahavarman has been killed by the king of M\u0101lwa\u00b9, who has also thrown R\u0101jya\u00e7ri into prison. R\u0101jyavardhana at once determines to avenge his brother-in-law's death and marches with his cousin Bha\u1e47\u1e0di\u00b2 and the army, leaving Har\u1e63a as his vicegerent. After a time news is brought that he had easily conquered the M\u0101lwa army but had been treacherously assassinated by the King of Gau\u1e0da\u00b3. Har\u1e63a himself now marches against this new enemy; on his way he accepts offers of friendship from Bh\u0101skaravarman\u2074, the King of Pr\u0101gjyoti\u1e63a (Assam). Soon afterwards he meets Bha\u1e47\u1e0di, who is returning loaded with spoil and bringing the M\u0101lwa troops prisoners; he announces that R\u0101jya\u00e7ri has escaped from prison and fled into the Vindhya forest. Har\u1e63a sends Bha\u1e47\u1e0di against the Gau\u1e0da king and hastens himself to find his lost sister. By the help of a Buddhist mendicant he comes upon her, just as she is preparing to mount the funeral pile, surrounded by her female attendants. Har\u1e63a rescues her from the pile and takes her with him to the camp, after making a vow that he and his sister will assume the dress of Buddhist mendicants as soon as he has conquered the Gau\u1e0da traitor and consoled his subjects in their sorrow for his deceased father.\n\nHar\u1e63a's partiality for Buddhists and Buddhist doctrines\n\n47, Corpus Inscr. Ind. iii. \u0100dityavarman had as his queen Har\u1e63agupt\u0101, sister to Har\u1e63agupta, of the same Guptas of Magadha, who were similarly connected with Har\u1e63a's family.\n\n\u00b9 Professor B\u00fchler suggests that this is the Northern M\u0101lwa about Fatehpur. He would identify the king with the Devagupta of the Madhuban Inscription.\n\u00b2 Poni in Hiuen Thsang.\n\u00b3 Cf. Hiuen Thsang, (Julien), ii. 248.\n\u2074 Bh\u0101skaravarma Kum\u0101ra, in Hiuen Thsang.\nis frequently brought out in our story, as the foregoing sketch will shew,\u2014he seems indeed to be more than half a Buddhist at heart; and it is remarkable that we find a similar view of his character in Hiuen Thsang\u2019s account, although he may naturally exaggerate the amount of favour shewn. His language might indeed imply that the king almost professed himself a Buddhist; but his narrative clearly shews that he was equally tolerant to both the great religions of his subjects.\n\nThus, when he held a great assembly at Kany\u0101kubja, twenty kings attended it, with the most distinguished \u0108rama\u1e47as and Brahmans in their districts. An immense sa\u1e45gh\u0101rama was erected with a tower and a golden image of Buddha, and every day viands were presented to the \u0108rama\u1e47as and Brahmans; and, in the disciples\u2019 account of the second assembly held at Pray\u0101ga, we find that on the first day they installed the statue of Buddha, on the second that of the Sun, and on the third that of Mahe\u00e7vara. Hiuen Thsang says of the inhabitants of Kany\u0101kubja, \u201cune moiti\u00e9 suit la vraie doctrine, et l\u2019autre s\u2019attache \u00e0 l\u2019erreur\u201d; and our narrative similarly shews us the two religions existing side by side; and in the elaborate description in the eighth chapter of the Vindhya forest, we find Buddhists and Brahmans of every sect, \u201call diligently following their own tenets, pondering, urging objections, raising doubts and resolving them.\u201d When we read these accounts of India in the seventh century they lend some support to the theory that later Brahmanism was itself a renaissance, and was separated by a chasm from the ancient cult, just as the Sassanian religion was a later revival (after the long Parthian domination) which turned a longing eye to the past glories of the Zoroastrian creed under the Ach\u00e6menid\u00e6.\n\nFor our translation we have chiefly used the Bombay text (though with a corrected punctuation), but we have collated it with the Calcutta and Kashmir editions. Pandit\nKail\u0101sacandra Datta \u00c7\u0101str\u012b had published the text and translation of the fifth book (Benares, 1883), with an original Sanskrit commentary of his own; this has often helped us in obscure passages and we have frequently quoted it. Pandit Ravaji R\u0101macandra Kale has also published (Bombay 1882) a very useful volume of English notes to the whole work; this only came into our hands when our translation was more than half printed, but we gladly acknowledge our obligations to the author as he often supplements or improves upon the printed commentary. When our translation was partly printed we obtained the help of the valuable MS. (A) which Hofrath Prof. B\u00fchler has presented to the India Office Library, and he also lent to us a collection of the various readings of another MS. and a native scholar's notes on the first book. The MS. A has been of great assistance to us and we have frequently quoted it in the later part of our translation and in the Notes in the Appendix, but as we were not re-editing the text, we have chiefly consulted it where the native editions seemed corrupt.\n\nWe are painfully conscious of the imperfections of our translation; but we offer it to Oriental scholars as an honest attempt to help the student in reading a difficult Sanskrit work which will well repay the trouble of mastering it. The book is full of Sanskrit lore of every kind; but its author was not (as Gibbon says of Libanius) \"a recluse student whose mind, regardless of his contemporaries, was incessantly fixed on the Trojan war and the Athenian commonwealth.\" He was by no means the mere lover of what was abstruse and difficult; he had also an eye for the picturesque and the pathetic, and he could sympathise with the men and women of his own time;\u2014like Apollonius Rhodius, he was a poet as well as a grammarian.\n\n[He was an old pupil in the Calcutta Sanskrit College.

A new subject, a diction not too homely, unlaboured double meanings, the sentiment easily understood, the language rich in sonorous words\u2014all this it is difficult to combine in one composition.\n\n[4] 9. What has that poet to do with poetry, whose language, going to the furthest limits of metrical skill, does not fill the three worlds like the Bh\u0101rata story?\n\n10.

The pride of poets verily melted away through V\u0101savadatt\u0101 (when it came to their ears), as the pride of the Br\u0101hma\u1e47 seers through the (Indra-given) spear of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas when it came near Kar\u1e47a.\n\n[5] 12.

As he so sate, adored of the three worlds, the Praj\u0101patis headed by Manu, Dak\u1e63a, and C\u0101k\u1e63u\u1e63a, and all the great sages with the seven \u1e5a\u1e63is worshipped him. Some in chorus chanted the \u1e5ak hymns apt for psalmody; some recited the Yajus sentences of worship; some sang aloud the S\u0101man strains of praise. Others rehearsed the Mantras that reveal the ritual of the sacrifice. And there, arising from the differences of their studies, quarrels one with another we heard among them.\n\nNow there was a certain sage, a great ascetic, by nature excessively choleric, a son of Atri and brother of the moon, by name Durv\u0101sas, and he, while brawling with a second sage named Mandap\u0101la, [9] being blinded by passion made a discord in singing a S\u0101man. At this silence fell on all the other sages through fear of a curse, while Brahm\u0101 in the sport of another conversation heeded not. But the divine Sarasvat\u012b, a maiden of tender years, now doffing her girlhood and arrayed in youthful beauty, was fanning the great Father with a fly-flap held by her arm\u2019s waving tendril. Those sprays, her feet, glowed with a natural red as though flushed by furious stripes, and her steps were musical with a\n\n\u00b9 Cf. Manu, iii. 231.\npair of anklets keeping time with them like two disciples intoning the Veda word by word. Her legs produced the illusion of being the pillars of the portal to the city of Love\\(^1\\). Her left hand, like a bud, was laid in sport on the chain of her girdle, which tinkled like the murmur of love-sick kala-hamsas. Her body was made pure by a Br\u0101hmanical thread, which, hanging from the shoulder, seemed like a coil of virtues that had clung to her through dwelling in the M\u0101nasa\\(^2\\) of the wise: while her necklace, studded with many a pearl and having a brilliant central gem, suggested the path of renunciation, leading midway the sun and lined by many liberated souls\\(^3\\). Her quivering lips glowed red as with lac from the feet of all the sciences, which had entered her mouth. In her cheek was reflected an image of Brahm\u0101's black deer-skin, as if the moon's deer were come down to hearken to her honeyed song. [10] One eyebrow like a creeper was raised in a disdainful curve, and a stream of tears flowing from the outer corner of her eye seemed to be washing one ear soiled by the discord\\(^4\\); while the other ear, revelling in a white full-blown Sindhuvi\u015bra flower, betokened as with a gleaming smile the intoxication of knowledge\\(^5\\). In the flowers of her ear-ornament tribes of devoted bees attended upon her like repeated Oms accompanying the \u010cruti. Her form was clad in a silken robe fine and spotless\n\n---\n\n1 Cf. Spenser, *Faery Queen*, Bk. ii. c. iii. 27, 28,\n   'And her straight legs most bravely were embayled\n   In gilden buskins of costly cordwayne...\n   Like two fair marble pillours they were seen\n   Which doe the temples of the gods support.'\n   \nAlso *V\u0101savadatt\u0101*, p. 54 (Hall).\n\n2 There is a pun on m\u0101nasa=(1) mind, (2) lake M\u0101nasa.\n\n3 The Sanskrit here has puns on mukta \u2018released\u2019 and \u2018pearl\u2019 and on madhyan\u0101yaka \u2018central gem\u2019 and \u2018spiritual guide through the centre.\u2019 The Comm. quotes a passage to the effect that \u2018the ascetic who attains yoga and the warrior slain face to face with his foe pass through the centre of the sun\u2019: cf. the last note to this chapter.\n\n4 The eyebrow is compared to a spray used in sprinkling the ear.\n\n5 A laugh is often called by the Hindus \u2018white,\u2019 cf.

In this guise, shedding on all sides the moonlight of her teeth, pure as if of the substance of speech, the goddess Sarasvat\u012b, hearing the discord, smiled.\n\nSeeing her so smiling, 'Wretch!' cried the sage, 'vain in the conceit of a grain of ill-got knowledge, dost jeer at me?' With these words, shaking his head so that his matted locks, streaming\\(^1\\) from the broken fillet, seemed by their outpouring yellowness to flood the heavens with an issuing fire of passion; gathering a frown that darkened the chess-board\\(^2\\) of his forehead, like the presence of the god of death, and recalled the crocodile embellishments upon the faces of Yama's wives; with a red eye offering, as it were, an oblation of his blood to the goddess of pitilessness; imprisoning [11] the gleam of his teeth, as if it were his voice flying in terror at the merciless biting of his lip; altering the tie of the black antelope skin\u2014a scroll of cursing as it were\u2014which was slipping from his shoulder; clasped in every limb by gods, asuras, and sages, who, reflected in his drops of sweat, seemed to have come for refuge in their alarm at the curse; with a hand whose fingers shook with an angry tremor spurning his rosary as though it were a string of syllables clinging with supplications to him; thus, having first rinsed his mouth from his earthen pitcher, he took the water of cursing.\n\nMeanwhile the great goddess S\u0101vitr\u012b was seated in corporeal shape near to the Self-existent, wearing a robe of the silken bark of the tree of paradise and white as a mass of ambrosia foam. A shawl of lotus filament was tied in a svastika knot between her swelling bosoms. Three sectarial lines of ashes, banners of triumph, as it were, over the three worlds vanquished by ascetic force, brightened the courtyard of her forehead. Her Vaikak\u1e63yaka scarf consisted of a hermit's wrap which hung from her shoulder, white as ambrosia foam, like a Ganges stream bent to a circle by\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Vi\u1e63\u0101r\u0101ru apparently = 'bursting.'\n\n\\(^2\\) \u0100\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101padam: catura\u1e45gaphalakam, Comm.: perhaps so called from its furrowed lines. Regarding this and the next allusion vide further note in the appendix.\nascetic power. Her left hand held a crystal water-vessel like the lotus calyx whence Brahm\u0101 arose; and her right, encircled with a rosary and studded with rings of shells, was raised aloft, the finger of scorn being scornfully waved as she cried:\u2014\u2018Fie on thee, sinner, prey to anger, evil of heart, reft of reason, ignorant of self, [12] false Br\u0101hma\u1e47a and pretended sage, outcast, excommunicate, how comes it that, bewildered by thine own offence, thou wouldst curse the divine Sarasvat\u012b, mother of the three worlds, fit adoration for throngs of gods, asuras, sages, and mortal men?\u2019\n\nSo she spoke, and abandoning her ascetic\u2019s pillow arose, and with her the four incarnate Vedas left their cane seats in wrath, clad in bark garments and holding delicate chowries of Ku\u1e47\u1e0da fibres, bearing their hermit\u2019s staves, and grasping their round water-vessels like weapons. Under the guise of sweat soma juice, as it were, oozed from them: their foreheads gleamed with the pure ashes of the Agnihotra oblation: their voices echoed the sacred syllable: the quarters of the heavens were oppressed by the weight of their angrily agitated matted-locks: the daylight was darkened by the bulging of their black antelope skins flung round as they girt up their loins: and the world of Brahm\u0101 vibrated with the coming and going of their passionate panting.\n\nWhereat in vain besought to mercy by the gods, \u2018O reverend sir, be merciful, she is no victim for a curse\u2019; in vain implored by suppliant disciples, \u2018Master, forgive one fault\u2019; in vain restrained by Atri, \u2018Balk not, my son, the fruit of thine asceticism\u2019; the sage, beside himself with passion, let fall the water of that curse, crying:\u2014\u2018Ill-mannered girl, I take away from thee this state of pride by knowledge won. Begone downward to the world of mortal men.\u2019 But when S\u0101vitr\u012b would have answered curse with curse, \u2019twas Sarasvat\u012b that hindered her, saying:\u2014\u2018Dear friend, restrain thy wrath: even to Br\u0101hma\u1e47as by birth merely, uninitiated in heart, respect is due.\u2019 [13]\n\nThereupon, seeing Sarasvat\u012b thus cursed, the Lord Brahm\u0101 uplifted his form, which wore the white sacrificial thread, as though his birth from the lotus had left a fibre clinging\nabout him. With his right hand, which, as its signet ring sent up a spray of emerald rays, seemed to grasp a cluster of Ku\u1e63a grass for staying a world-dissolution\u00b9, he allayed the tumult of the curse; while his teeth shot out pure penetrating rays like plummet lines\u00b2 for the building of a coming aeon of bliss, and his voice echoed through the spheres like a drum heralding with honour the departure of Sarasvat\u012b, as in deep tones he spake:\u2014'Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, the path thou hast followed is one not frequented by the good. Its final goal is death. The dust upraised by the steeds of passion in their unbridled onrush is wont to cloud the vision of such as be not masters of the senses\u00b3. How limited indeed the scope of the eye! for 'tis by the purified intellect that the perfected behold all things good and evil. Nature rejects this union of piety and wrath as of water and fire. How dost thou, leaving the light, sink in darkness! for the root of all asceticism is patience. Skilled in discerning the faults of others, thy angry mind, like an eye inflamed, perceives not the frailty of its own passion\u2074. How can censoriousness consort with commerce of great penances? [14] Blind verily is that seeing man who is over-wrathful. Clouded with passion, the mind distinguishes not what should and what should not be done. First of all the wisdom of the angry man is darkened; then his frowning brow. The flush of passion assaults first the senses, last the eyes. In the beginning the store of merit dissolves away; then the oozing sweat. The flash of dishonour flickers; then comes the trembling of the lip. How ruinous to the world was the growth of thy matted locks and bark dress, shoots and bark as it were of the poison tree! Like a pearl necklace, this graceless\u2075 impulse of thy mind is out of\n\n\u00b9 The origin of darbha=ku\u1e63a grass from a world-convulsion is stated Ath.

With a heart void of resignation idly like an actor dost thou wear the counterfeited semblance of an ascetic. Nought free from taint can I detect in thee. Even to this hour thy levity floats but on the surface of the sea of knowledge. None of these great sages are deaf and dumb, impotent and dull of wit. Why hast thou checked the sinless Sarasvat\u012b, when thine own heart, the haunt of angry sin, should rather have been checked? These are the follies born of their own heedless slips whereby the undiscerning fall into reproach.'\n\nThen to Sarasvat\u012b he spake again:\u2014'Dear child, be not dejected. S\u0101vitr\u012b here shall accompany thee and solace the pain of severance from us. And the curse shall end when thou shalt behold the lotus face of thy child.'\n\nSo much decreed, Brahm\u0101, having dismissed his court of gods, asuras, sages and mortal men, laid his hand upon the shoulder of N\u0101rada, who hastily approached, and arose for the performance of his daily rites. [15] Sarasvat\u012b, too, a little discomfited at the curse, letting fall upon her bosom a mingled glance of light and dark like a streak in a black antelope skin, led on by thronging bees caught, like the incarnate letters of the curse, in the incense of her fragrant sighs, her hands nerveless with sorrow at the curse, went with S\u0101vitr\u012b to her mansion, her path to the world of men being pointed out as it were by the down-bent rays of her nails. And swarms of kalahamsas of the palace, convoked by the prattle of her anklets, followed after her like the hearts of the dwellers in Brahm\u0101's world.\n\nMeanwhile, as though to bear the tidings of Sarasvat\u012b's descent, the light-coroneted sun went down to the middle world. Gradually waned the day, his pools all saddened by the calamity of the closing of all their lotus beds. Quickly, as though stung by the angrily bent side-glances of wine-flushed beauties, the world's sole eye, ruddy as a young monkey's mouth, lighted upon the peaks of the earth-propping hills. White were the environs of the heavenly hermitages with milky streams flowing from herds of cows with dripping\nudders; as though washed by the surge of the milky sea in uproar at the near rising of the moon. Let out for his evening ramble, the chowrie-crowned Air\u0101vata was dashing his tusks at will against the banks of the heavenly stream, while the sound went up of their crashing against its sides of gold. The sky displayed a rosy tint, as though smeared with lac from the feet of thousands of mistresses of the Vidy\u0101dharas gone forth to their trysts. Like the sweat of Sandhy\u0101 in her delight at \u00c7iva\u2019s worship\u00b9, the evening glow streamed forth of saffron hue, flushing the heavenly spaces and filled with the sunset offerings of the saints on their journey along the sky. [16] Resplendent was the world of Brahm\u0101, where crowds of noble worshipping sages clasped a forest of hands in evening adoration; as though all the lotus beds were come to show honour to that lotus whence Brahm\u0101 sprang. And loudly from the Br\u0101hmans\u00b2 uprose the chorus of the third libation hymn. In the temples of the seven sages the courts were all tressed with the flames of the lighted Vait\u0101na fires; as though a camp lustration had commenced in an army devoted to Dharma. Light were the hermits from the removal of the poison taint of sin which the Aghamar\u1e63ana hymn\u00b3 had stolen away. The sand isles of Mandakin\u012b\u2019s stream were purified by rows of ascetics seated at evening prayer, and the line of its waves was broken by the gleam\u2074 of Brahm\u0101\u2019s floating hamsas. Fragrant with the scent of their own honey, the night-lotus beds, to the joy of the bees, commenced to open, like umbrellas of the water nymphs, seraglio mansions for the wives of the feathered tribes. Satisfied with their symposiums on the sweet honey of day-lotuses now languid at day\u2019s close, the flamingo swarms sank to sleep, arching their necks to be scratched by the soft fibres, and fanning the blue lotus beds with rows of flapping wings. The evening breeze, soft as the sigh of night, came making grey the river with the pollen of flowers\n\n\u00b9 \u00c7iva\u2019s evening worship is described in the Meghad\u016bta gl. 38.\n\u00b2 Or \u2018loud in Brahm\u0101\u2019s praise\u2019 or \u2018loudly from Brahm\u0101.\u2019\n\u00b3 The Aghamar\u1e63ana hymn is the last in the Rig-Veda.\n\u2074 Literally \u2018betoothed by the smile.\u2019\non the bank and bearing perfume from the jasmine\\(^1\\) in the curls of the matrons of the City of Saints.

About the earth the new-born darkness closed, coppery-hued from the after-effects of the twilight, coloured like the skin of a ripe date, and thick as the cloud of doomsday\\(^2\\). Sharply piercing the mass of soft dusk, the scattered lamps peeped forth like clusters of Campak buds about the ear of the goddess of night. Paling with the lovely effulgence of the crescent moon\u2019s rays, the eastern quarter began to narrow the dusk, like a young sandbank by Yamun\u0101\u2019s banks when the dark water retreats as it dries. Perturbed, like the spirit of a proud beauty, by the moon\u2019s fingers\\(^3\\) clutching its tresses, the darkness, in hue like a jay\u2019s wing, a very cluster of curls belonging to the Gipsy\\(^4\\) of night, dissolved and abandoned the sky, and cast its gloom upon the pools of blossoming blue lotuses. The form of the Lord of White Splendour, now uprisen, assumed the glow of the Udaya mountain, resembling the lip of the nymph of night; and his redness was as though he were covered with blood oozing from his own deer, now slain by a stroke from the rending paws of the lion that dwells in the caves of the valleys of Udaya\u2019s peaks. The gloom had waned, as if washed by the flow of the moonstone\u2019s ooze from\\(^5\\) the Eastern hill. Like a great ivory crocodile-mouthed conduit bearing a stream of milk trickling from the world of cows, the moon\u2019s circle had commenced to fill the ocean. [18]\n\nAt that clear evening time S\u0101vitra thus addressed Sarasvat\u012b, who, vacant in heart as it were, was lost in tearful thought:\u2014\u2018Friend, my tongue is ashamed to prate to thee,\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Mallik\u0101 = bh\u016bpad\u012b, opens at night.\n\n\\(^2\\) Or \u2018a black cloud.\u2019\n\n\\(^3\\) I.e. \u2018rays.\u2019\n\n\\(^4\\) Her beauty hangs upon the cheek of Night\n\nLike a rich jewel in an Ethiop\u2019s ear. *Romeo and Juliet.*\n\n\\(^5\\) Read acalacyuta with the Calc. and Kashmir texts.\nwhose wisdom may instruct the three worlds. Thou knowest already what are the ill-mannered ways of fate, unstable, heedless, like a lowborn person, even of the worthy, inconstant, not to be evaded, in no wise pleasurable\\(^1\\). A mere grain of undeserved humiliation, coming from an inferior, makes turbid the spirit\\(^2\\) even of the wise. Even an atom of misfortune, when watered with ceaseless tears, like a leafless tree, puts forth a thousand shoots. An over-delicate soul, like a M\u0101lat\u012b blossom, is withered by the particles of fiery pain. Like the elephant\u2019s goad, even a slight prick of trouble, assailing the great, suffices to torment. Moreover our native home, linked to us like a kinsman by the knotted ties of natural affection, is hard to abandon. Separation from approved friends, dreadful as the stroke of the wood-cleaving saw, leaves a fissure in the heart. But thee it befits not to be thus afflicted. Thou surely art not the soil in which should spring up the shoots of the poison plant of pain. Also, seeing that before and behind us like a ruler stand our past deeds, potent whether good or evil in producing their fruit, [19] what occasion have the wise for sorrowing? Why, pray, do these inauspicious tears defile a face which is the single lotus of auspiciousness for the three worlds? Enough now of this: say what part of the world thou wouldst adorn. On what blest spot is thy heart fain to alight? What holy bathing-places dost thou desire to grace? In what fortunate forest seclusions wouldst thou live the ascetic\u2019s life? Here am I ready to descend to earth, a loving friend, well-skilled to serve thee, tried in friendly offices when we played together in the dust. Cast thyself henceforth in heart, voice and deed, seeking no other refuge, upon the author of all knowledge, the bestower of paradise, the dust of whose feet makes pure both gods and asuras, whose earring is formed of the moon\u2019s digits, even on \u00c7iva, god of gods, preceptor of the three worlds. In but a little time he will give thee release from the woe of the curse.\\(^3\\)\n\n\\(^1\\) The ways of fate are here punningly compared to the caprices of women, cf. v\u0101m\u0101h: striya\u00e7ca Comm.\n\n\\(^2\\) There is a pun on lake M\u0101nasa made turbid by a falling particle.\n\n\\(^3\\)\nTo these words Sarasvat\u012b, letting fall a pearly white tear-drop, replied:\u2014'Dear friend, if I go with thee, neither severance from Brahm\u0101\u2019s world nor grief at the curse will cause me any distress: \u2019tis only that the happiness of serving the lotus-throned fills my heart with soft regret. Furthermore \u2019tis thou who knowest the abodes where Dharma can be followed\u00b9 upon earth, the means of mystic meditation, and how to practise the postures of ascetic rapture.\u2019 So much said she ceased to speak: and that night she spent with unclosed eyes, sleepless through agitation.\n\nNext day as, heralded by the dawn [20] rosy as an old cock\u2019s comb, the adorable sun, the world\u2019s diadem, Mount Udaya\u2019s crest jewel, arose with a form red as with blood scattered from the mouths of his own steeds cut by the tossing clanking bit, the keeper of the goose tribes that draw Brahm\u0101\u2019s chariot\u00b2 sang aloud in Aparavaktr\u0101 metre as he strolled along not far away:\u2014\n\n\u2018Wherefore trembles thine anxious glance,\n\u2018O nursling of pellucid M\u0101nasa as thy home?\n\u2018Descend, O kalahamsa, to the pond;\n\u2018Again shalt thou return to the abode of lotuses.\u2019\n\nHearing this Sarasvat\u012b thought: \u2018\u2019Tis I, methinks, to whom he appeals. So be it! I must respect the sage\u2019s sentence.\u2019 So she arose resolved to descend to the earth, and having left her attendants prostrate at the separation, parted from her kindred, and then, like one cut off from the herd, passed thrice round the four-faced god. At last, courteously turning back crowds of pursuing devotees, she set forth accompanied by S\u0101vitr\u012b from Brahm\u0101\u2019s world.\n\nStraight she came to the steady-flowing\u00b3 loud-roaring river Mand\u0101kini with milky udders downward streaming\u2074 like the cow of Dharma, a very M\u0101lat\u012b wreath for the head\n\n\u00b9 As e.g. Madhyade\u00e7a, Manu ii. 21.\n\u00b2 The Kashmir and Bombay texts insert here vivicya: vic\u0101rya \u2018having reflected.\u2019\n\u00b3 Or \u2018descended from Dhruva,\u2019 i.e. from the star of Dhruva or the firmament or Vi\u1e63\u1e47u; cf.

The bark of its trees had been washed by Arundhat\u012b. [21] The clear stars were tremulous as they crossed its high-leaping waves. Its sand-isles were bristling beds of floating sesamum seeds and water\\(^3\\) offered by ascetics. All white were its banks with offerings to the manes let fall by Brahm\u0101 when purified by bathing. Ku\u00e7a-grass beds of the seven Ri\u015bis, who had slept hard by, gave token of the birth-fast for the sun\u2019s delivery from eclipse\\(^4\\). Dappled was it with abundant flowers from the service, let fall by \u00c7aci\u2019s lord when purified by rinsing his mouth. It had garlands of Mand\u0101ra blossoms, dropped as the remains of the sacrifice from \u00c7iva\u2019s city. Scornfully had it cleft the rocks of Mandara\u2019s caves. Rippled was its surface with the cup-like bosoms of unnumbered beauties of Indra\u2019s court\\(^5\\). Its waters were resonant with its tumbling over myriad stones and crocodiles. Masses of the moon\u2019s ambrosial dew bestarred its banks, flowing down from the sun\u2019s Su\u1e63um\u1e47a ray. Grey were its sands with smoke from the fire of Dhi\u1e63\u0101\u1e47a\\(^6\\). Vidy\u0101-dharas were flying in terror at its leaping over the sand li\u1e45gas erected by the saints. Such was the river, the cast slough, as it were, of the sky serpent, the sportive forehead-ornament of the jester of Indra\u2019s world\\(^7\\), the bazaar street of the wares of Dharma, the shot bolt of the gate of Hell\u2019s city, the silken turban wrap of Sumeru\u2019s king\\(^8\\), the cloth banner of Kail\u0101sa\u2019s elephant, the track of liberation, the wheel-rim of the aeon\\(^9\\) of goodness, the bride of the lord of the seven oceans\\(^10\\).\n\nPassing along its banks Sarasvat\u012b descended to the world of mortals; and just as she stood on the edge of the sky she\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The heavenly Ganges falls on \u00c7iva\u2019s head.\n\n\\(^2\\) Liliputian munis concerning whom many stories are told.\n\n\\(^3\\) For the tilodakam cf.

[22] At the sight her heart was taken captive by its beauty, and there upon its bank she resolved to dwell; so she said to S\u0101vitr\u012b:\u2014\u2018Pleasant to me, friend, is the neighbourhood of this great river, which makes dull the lustre of Mand\u0101kini. Here are honeyed voices of peacocks, trees having stocks besanded with heaps of pollen, the entrancing hum of lute-like clusters of scent-intoxicated bees. My heart prompts me to abide even here.\u2019 So as S\u0101vitr\u012b welcomed her words, saying, \u2018Thus let it be,\u2019 she alighted with her friend upon the western bank: and for a dwelling she fixed her mind upon a certain fair creeper arbour by the shore containing a slab of stone. Then after resting she soon arose, and having with S\u0101vitr\u012b gathered flowers for worship, bathed: next, having in \u00c7iva\u2019s honour erected sand li\u1e45gas on the sand-isles, she with deep devotion performed in full the ritual of clasping of fingers together with the Dhruv\u0101 hymn and preceded by the Pa\u00f1cabrahma prayer\u00b2; lastly after long meditation on the eight incarnate forms, earth, wind, water, sky, fire, sun, moon, sacrificer, she presented the eightfold\u00b3 offering of flowers, and refreshed her body with easily gathered roots and fruits and \u00c7ona water, cool and of a sweetness surpassing even ambrosia. That day passed, she made a couch of flowers and slept on the stone floor of the creeper arbour. On the morrow she spent night and day in the same routine.\n\n[23] Now as the days in this wise sped on and time passed, one morning, when the sun was risen only one watch, she heard in the northern quarter the deep clear sound of horses\u2019 neighs\n\n\u00b9 I.e. as mirroring the sky. \u00c7ri often reclines on a slab.\n\u00b2 A prayer addressed to Sadyoj\u0101ta, V\u0101madeva, Aghora, Tatpuru\u1e63a and \u012ac\u0101na.

Her curiosity aroused, she came forth, and looking abroad from the bower beheld at no great distance and speeding towards her a cloud of dust grey as the leaf which contains the blossoming Ketaki flower. In due course, as proximity gave birth to distinctness, she saw a troop of horse floating in that huge mass of dust grey as a \u00c7aphara\u2019s belly, like a school of crocodiles in water. Before it ran an army of foot about a thousand strong, mostly young men, with clusters of crisp hanging hair upon their foreheads, and cheeks laughing with the bright gleam of their ear-ornaments; girt with scented jerkins spotted with a powder of black aloe wood paste; their upper garments formed into turbans; sparkling golden bracelets on their left forearms, daggers fastened in strong knots in their sashes of doubled cloth; tirelessly with bodies thin and hard from incessant exercise leaping like the deer of the winds and spurning smooth and rough ground, holes, and clumps of bushes; clubs at their sides, swords in their hands; laden with various wild flowers, fruits, roots, and leaves for worship; and making a ceaseless hubbub with cries of \u2018On, on, make speed, make speed, away, away, make way in front.\u2019 In the midst [24] she discerned a youth in age about eighteen years, shaded by a sky-reaching umbrella, which with its half-moon, its girdling heaps of pearls, its inlay of pieces of various precious stones, and its whiteness as of shells, milk and foam, resembled the milky ocean voluntarily come to present Lak\u1e63m\u012b. All about him was the sparkling light of his ornaments, as if the horizon of the heavens were keeping close out of passion for the sight of him. Down to his loins from his topknot hung a wreath of Malati flowers, like a pennon of beauty won by a world conquest. The red rays uprising from the ruby in his crest\u00b9 seemed delicate sprays carried by an invisible goddess to cleanse his travel-soiled form. His hair, wreathed in clusters of crisp curls and charmingly adorned with a coiled coronet\u00b2\n\n\u00b9 \u00c7ikhan\u1e0dakhandik\u0101: c\u016b\u1e0d\u0101bhara\u1e47am.

His forehead, all yellow as with arsenic paste, cast the glow of its beauty upon the heavens, and being clasped by its natural loveliness, seemed composed of a second\\(^1\\) portion of the moon which forms the coronet of \u00c7iva's matted locks. His wide eyes, whose glances bold in the confidence of fresh youth's commencement made nought of the whole world, appeared to create an autumn, clothing the heavens in myriad pools of opening white, blue and red lotuses. His long nose was like a river of beauty's water, flowing from beneath the moonstone of his forehead, and bridged across the stream of his long eyes. His mouth, breathing a fragrance of mangos, camphor, *Kakkola*-fruits, cloves, and coral trees, and resounding with a hubbub of intoxicated bee-swarms, seemed to emit a very spring together with a Nandana forest. His innocent smiles, bathing the heavens with the light of his teeth as he uplifted his face to catch the jests of his friends around him,\\([25]\\) created incessantly a kind of moonlight roaming about the sky. A dangling three-pointed ear-ornament\u2014an emerald set between a pair of pearls big as *Kadamba* buds\u2014emitted a sheen which suggested a pendant of green jasmine leaves with their flowers. His arms, decorated with painted lines of scented civet powder, resembled a pair of K\u0101ma's pennon poles with rampant crocodiles girdling their tops. His body was divided by a white Brahmanical thread, like Mandara encircled by the stream of Ganges indignant at the churning of the ocean\\(^2\\). His breast, a broad sandbank with two shapely swelling bosoms for ruddy-geese, and with a coating of camphor powder in handfuls for dust, seemed a horizon spread out before him and kept within bounds by the length of his stout arms. His slim waist was marked off by a tight-\n\n---\n\n1 The first portion having been used for \u00c7iva, the second remains for this hero.

His stout thighs, glistening with a thick smearing of bright sandal, seemed to scoff at the length of Air\u0101vata's trunk, being very stone pillars for supporting the granite platform of his great chest; while his knees issued from huge 'crocodile mouths'\\(^2\\) with hard flesh accumulated by incessant exercise. His shanks were somewhat slim, as if from the fatigue of supporting the weight of his vast thighs. His feet, which hung on either side, were red as two young shoots of the tree of paradise, and the waving light of their nails formed as it were a row of chowrie ornaments for his horse.\n\n[26] He was mounted on a great steed, swift as thought, in colour like a dark Sindhuv\u0101ra flower, and with a coat as black as a gol\u0101ng\u016bla ape's cheeks. As it advanced its high prancing hoofs seemed to rest awhile in the air when it coiled its legs, and falling to tear up the earth. Every moment the hard bit clanked when released by the teeth. Upon its forehead dangled rings of fine gold and the end of the bit rested against its long nose. It was adorned with tinkling trappings of gold. Close on either side with their hands grasping the saddle cloth, two attendants shook white chowries. In front chanted a bard, whose eloquence caused the hairs on the young man's cheeks to bristle with delight, as though tiny stamen filaments from his ear-wreath had become attached to them. He seemed to reveal a descent of a K\u0101ma's aeon, to produce a cosmos of moonlight, to beget an animate creation of the substance of smiles, to pave his path with devotion, to frame a day all of love, to inaugurate a kingdom of affection. He was to the eye, as it were, a collyrium of allurement, to the heart an attracting spell, to the senses a powder able to affect the healthiest; for desire a never-cloying delight, for\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The Harita is a kind of pigeon.\n\n\\(^2\\) Makaramukha is a name given to the upper part of the knee; makaramukham: j\u0101nunor uparibh\u0101ga\u1e25.

Tall, in aspect like a pillar of molten gold, with a frame hardened in spite of advanced years by exercise, with short nails beard and hair, bald as a shell, somewhat stout, hairy-bosomed, dressed handsomely but with little display, he seemed one to teach even old age to be decorous, to add weight even to great qualities, to convert magnanimity itself to a disciple, to provide deportment itself with a monitor.\n\nWhen the young man heard of that pair of divinely shaped maidens\u2014for the footmen in the van took it all in at a glance and in astonishment made their report\u2014his curiosity was aroused, and putting his horse to a gallop, he rode up to the bower, eager to see them. While still at a distance, he alighted from his horse, and staying his suite, approached respectfully on foot attended only by the second noble personage. [28] Greetings made, S\u0101vitr\u012b and Sarasvat\u012b duly received them with the usual hospitality of forest life, beginning with the offer of a seat of twigs and ending with presents of fruit with flowers. They being seated, S\u0101vitr\u012b sate down, and after a not over-prolonged silence addressed herself to the second of the two, the man of advanced years:\u2014\n\n'Sir, to make the first address ill becomes women, whose innate modesty is their all, more especially noble girls, innocent as woodland fawns. Yet hearing, greedy to learn the news and emulous of the eye which has been gratified with seeing, moves me thereto. And indeed even at first sight the good proffer confidence like a gift.

Moreover, even in the profoundly wise the previously unknown masterpieces of creation visible in the world occasion astonishment; for the beauty of this high-souled youth is beyond anything in the universe. It is not the levity natural to young women that compels me to speak, but the exceeding grace, handmaid of high birth, that appears in this darling of heaven\\(^3\\). Therefore relate what hapless region has through your coming been desolated by the spreading plague of separation. What is your destination? Whose son is this young man, a second K\u0101ma humbling the pride of \u0106iva\u2019s roar? How named the sire, rich in austerities, whose heart this youth gladdens, as the Kau\u1e63\u1e6dubha jewel gladdens the heart of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, with an ambrosial shower? [29] Who was his mother, worthy of the worship of the three worlds, the parent, like the morning twilight, of a great splendour? What fortunate syllables make up his name? To inquire concerning your honour also is the next proceeding of a heart compliant to curiosity.'\n\nShe having so spoken, the other courteously replied:\u2014'Lady, kindly speech is a hereditary art among the noble. Not merely your face, your heart also is moonlike, bestowing delight by words cooling like ambrosia dew. Women like you come into the world as the native soil of nobility, nay, a greater glory, as the fine arts for forming noble characters\\(^4\\). Not to mention conversation, even interchange of glances with the noble is a great exaltation.

His mother was a princess, Sukany\u0101 named, a gem among the maidens of the universe, daughter of the world-conquering \u00c7ary\u0101ta, whose train is of unnumbered monarchs. Observing her to be with child, her father took her in the birth-month from her husband\u2019s side to his own dwelling, there to bear her child\u00b9. The son borne by the princess was this young man\u2014long life be his. [30] And in the king\u2019s house he in good time grew up, lotus-eyed, the delight of his kindred, like the young lord of stars\u00b2. Even when his daughter returned to her husband\u2019s house, the grandfather parted not from this cheery-faced\u00b3 grandson of his, a solace to the heart. There accordingly he was trained in all the sciences and the circle of the arts.\n\n\u2018In time, observing him to have attained to youth, his grandfather, reflecting that his father too should have the delight of gazing on his lotus face, has now prevailed upon himself to send him away to his father\u2019s presence. But me let your highness understand to be one named Vikuk\u1e63i, the least of servants, minister of the will of my auspiciously-named lord \u00c7ary\u0101ta. My master appointed me his attendant on the way to his father\u2019s feet.

If now this is a time for an act of grace, and your heart is void of contempt towards us, if such as we are fit recipients of favours and worthy to hear, let not this our first solicitation of curiosity meet with a repulse. We also are fain to hear your highnesses' story. Your aspect in no way falls short of divinity: but our hearts are eager to hear your lineage and names. Say therefore what stock was made enviable by your birth. Who is this lady near your highness, a coinherence as it were of mutually exclusive qualities? Thus:\u2014with the darkness of her locks close by, she has a radiance as of the sun; [31] with the face of a lotus\u00b9 the eye of a fawn; wearing the brilliance of the young day, she has yet the smile of a night-lotus; the voice of a lovesick kalahamsa, yet swelling bosoms\u00b2: hands soft as day-lotuses, yet hips broad as the rocks of the mountain of snow\u00b3; thighs like a young elephant's trunk, yet a languid gait; she has not passed the season of girlhood, yet she has the swimming eyes of love\u2074.\n\nS\u0101vitr\u012b answered:\u2014'You shall hear, my lord, in good time. Our hearts are fain to stay here many days: and the distance is slight. Intimacy will make all clear. Let my lord not forget people seen only by chance.' After which reply she became silent. But Dadh\u012bca, with a voice which, resembling the deep mutter of clouds laden with new rain, set the peacocks dancing in the creeper arbours, gravely said:\u2014'My lord, her highness being conciliated will be gracious to us; now let us visit my father. Rise, let us proceed.' Then, the other assenting, he slowly arose, and with a bow moved away. As he mounted his horse and departed, Sarasvat\u012b gazed for a long time after him with an eye with straight rigid lashes and pupil motionless as in a\n\n\u00b9 The contradiction turns on the double sense of pun\u1e0darika=(1) lotus, (2) lion.\n\u00b2 Payodhar\u0101\u1e25 may also mean 'clouds'; the kalahamsa migrates during the rainy season.\n\u00b3 Snow kills the lotus: hence the contradiction.\n\u2074 The words may also mean 'not faithless to Kum\u0101ra and yet loving his enemy T\u0101raka.'\nCrossing the \u00c7ona, Dadh\u012bca quickly reached the site of his father's seclusion. But when he disappeared Sarasvat\u012b stood for a long time gazing in that direction, and could hardly cease looking [32].\n\nThen, when she had remained quiet one short moment recalling that perfection of form, her heart was filled more and more with astonishment. Her eye longed to see him again; and something involuntarily drew her glance in the same direction as before. All uncommissioned her heart went away with him. Like a new spray upon a young wood-creeper, love somehow\u00b2 sprang up in her heart. She passed the day as it were languid, empty, and heavy with sleep. But when with westward inclining circle the sun's radiant form, lover of the lotus beds, sprung from the three Vedas, was nearing the west, with colour golden as a cluster of L\u0101ngalik\u0101s, and brilliance red as an old crane's head, while the gathering dusk sky-enveloping was befouling the firmament with a blackness like the bark of a young Tam\u0101la, and slowly slowly the moon was creeping up the heavens, like a swan of Mand\u0101kini, in pursuit of the tinkling anklets of the roaming mistresses of the saints,\u2014at that hour, the very outset of night, Sarasvat\u012b, her twilight worship done, fell with languid limbs on her couch of young shoots and there remained. S\u0101vitr\u012b also, having performed the evening ritual, in due course took to her couch of leaves at the usual hour of rest, and, drowsiness approaching, slept [33].\n\nBut the other, though she closed her eyes, enjoyed no sleep; her couch of leaves was deranged by repeated tossings of her limbs, and this was her thought:\u2014'Surely the world of mortals is above all worlds, since therein are born such gems, the three-worlds' pride, laden with the company of all fine qualities\u00b3. Thus:\u2014the moon is but a trickling drop\n\n\u00b9 This simile so common in Sanskrit poetry may be paralleled from Shakespeare 'Hamlet,' Act ii. sc. ii. 465, 'So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,' and also Coleridge, 'Ancient Mariner,'\n\n\u00b2 Kuto'pi=(1) 'somehow,' (2) 'from the earth.'\n\n\u00b3 Or 'heavy even for all necklaces.'\nof his face's flood of beauty: his glances are beds of expanding lotuses, white, blue, and red: the sparklings of his gem-like lips are forest avenues of open Bandh\u016bkas. To that body only the disembodied K\u0101ma can add a charm. Happy the eyes, hearts, and young beauty of those women within whose vision he comes. In displaying him to me only for a moment my ill-deeds in former births have wrought their fruit. What resource is open to me now?' Amid such thoughts as these drowsiness coming over her, she at length lay still awhile, and falling asleep beheld (in a vision) that very youth with the long eyes. Through that second dream-meeting the lord of the crocodile banner, drawing his bow to the ear, dealt her a pitiless stroke. When she awoke thus smit by K\u0101ma's bolt, then came unrest as if to learn her condition\u00b9. Thus was it with her:\u2014from that hour, [34] even though unsmitten by the pollen-whitened wood-creepers, she felt a smart. Though her eyes might not be hurt by flower-dust wafted by gentle breezes, yet she would let fall a tear. Though not bedewed by \u00c7ona spray scattered by myriad fanning hamsas' wings, yet a moisture came upon her. Though not borne by pairs of rocking K\u0101dambas\u00b2, yet was she agitated by the tossing waves of the sylvan lotus pools. Though untouched by the smoke of parting sighs let fall by severed pairs of ruddy-geese, yet she wore a pallid hue. Though unstung by the honey-making tribes, all grey with flower-dust, yet she would feverishly start.\n\nAfter the lapse of some nights Vikuk\u1e63i returning by the same route arrived at that place, and, having checked his attendants as before, approached with his umbrella-holder. Sarasvat\u012b, who had observed his approach from afar, sprang joyfully up, and, gazing with straining neck like a woodland fawn, seemed to bathe the way-worn traveller with a glance that whitened the ten regions of space. When he had accepted a seat, S\u0101vitr\u012b asked him affectionately 'My lord, is the young prince well?' He answered, 'Quite well, your highness, and he bears you both in remembrance: during the past days,\n\n\u00b9 I.e. as it were, to make a call.\n\u00b2 A goose with dark-grey wings.\nhowever, he is somewhat thin in figure, and experiences as it were an inexplicable and causeless void. [35] Also there will arrive later\u00b9 a lady named M\u0101lat\u012b, commissioned from him to inquire of you: she is a sigh of the prince.\u2019 Hearing this, S\u0101vitr\u012b once more spoke:\u2014\u2018A magnanimous prince indeed to honour with his acquaintance\u00b2 people scarcely known to him and seen only for an instant. His mind was, I suppose, accidentally caught by us for a moment as he passed, like a shawl by a wayside creeper. In your lord\u2019s son true nobility is not devoid of high birth. A listless world, truly, that it does not at any price purchase the hearts of the great so easily won to friendship. This is a pinnacle of nobility in the great, unattainable by others, whereby they win the whole world to their service.\u2019 Having spent some time in general\u00b3 conversation Vikuk\u1e63i went away in the direction of his choice.\n\nOn the morrow as the adorable jewel of day arose with his thousand rays, illimitable in splendour, invading the starlight, veiling the darkness, eager to expand the red lotuses, M\u0101lat\u012b was seen to have crossed the \u00c7ona and to be approaching with a small retinue of attendants\u2074. [38] While still far away, she was looted as it were by Sarasvat\u012b\u2019s wishes in her love for Dadh\u012bca, hurried on by her eagerness, met by her longings, embraced by her yearning, welcomed into her heart, bathed in her tears of joy, anointed\u2075 by her smile, fanned by her sighs, arrayed in the light of her eyes, worshipped with (the flower offering of) her lotus face, made a friend by her hopes. So she drew near, and, alighting from her steed, saluted from a distance with bowed head: then having been embraced by the pair she modestly sate down. Being courteously addressed by them, she congratulated herself, and with hands humbly laid upon her head an-\n\n\u00b9 The Comm. explains anvak\u1e63am=pratyak\u1e63am=\u2018in person\u2019: but query?\n\u00b2 Or \u2018inquiries.\u2019\n\u00b3 Ucc\u0101vacai\u1e25: prak\u1e5bitavastvasamspar\u1e63ibhi\u1e25, vicitrair iti v\u0101.

So concealing with a portion of her shawl of woven bark a heart which, as if the buds of curiosity were bursting forth, bristled with the rays from the nails of her left hand laid against her bosom; clinging to a neighbouring creeper (her hope of life, it seemed) which swayed with her incessant sighs, while her dangling ear-wreath suggested that her ear was running forth to listen; her blooming moonlike face flooding the world with an outpouring of beauty like a stream of passion; buoyed up by swarms of dusky bees attracted by the fragrance of her flowery couch, like embodied yearnings issuing forth blackened by the fire of K\u0101ma\u2019s flame; slowly, slowly in the fever of love\u2019s dart she uprose from her couch of flowers, and drawing nigh to her ear the M\u0101lat\u012b reflected in her cheek, as if out of shame she would say \u2018Whisper it to me,\u2019 with honeyed voice she gravely said:\u2014\n\n\u2018Why do you speak thus to me, friend M\u0101lat\u012b?

Take charge of my life.' 'Your commands are the highest of favours,' replied M\u0101lat\u012b, beside herself with joy, and bowing passed on her galloping steed across the \u00c7ona, and proceeded to Cyavana's hermitage to bring Dadh\u012bca. But the other out of love for her friend made S\u0101vitr\u012b also acquainted with the news. Her mind panting under its load of longing, she could scarcely pass the rest of the day which seemed an aeon. But when the adorable sun had sunk with all his radiance in the west, when the dusk was stilly descending, and the moon was issuing, like a lion from his cave, from the eastern quarter now gleaming as with a smile\\(^1\\), then Sarasvat\u012b sate herself down on the \u00c7ona sands, white, delicate as China silk, rolling in waves, like a silken-soft bed. On her brow was a jewel, the imaged moonlight, as it were, of Dadh\u012bca's toe-nails as in her dreams she fell in supplication at his feet. Reflected in the mirror of her cheek, the moon thus near to her ear seemed to be communicating K\u0101ma's charge, 'Fair smiling one, here have I brought thy heart's darling.' As her hand fanned her moist cheek, its nails scattered a horizon of rays, like a bundle of moon-digits converted into a yak-tail fan. Above her heart, sighing\\(^2\\) against her bosom, she had just strength to bear a young lotus stalk, like a rod let fall\\(^3\\) in sport by K\u0101ma across its portal to say 'Here none but Dadh\u012bca may enter.' [42] Thus did she expect him, and this was the thought in her heart, 'Since I, even I, Sarasvat\u012b, have been enslaved, like a low-caste woman, by this heart's son K\u0101ma, what is to be expected of other poor excitable maidens?'\n\nWith M\u0101lat\u012b Dadh\u012bca came bringing sweet perfumes like the month of honey, bearing like a hamsa cooling lotus fibres, his face uplifted in deep joy like a peacock at a cloud\\(^4\\), causing like the Malaya breeze a tremour upon a\n\n---\n\n1.

A throng of bees crowding towards his fragrance arrayed his willowy form as with a dark garment: the moon\u2019s image, gleaming within like the ear-shell\\(^4\\) of love\u2019s raging elephant, whitened the convex of his cheek as with the coy aimless smile of a first union. Having arrived and greeted her with a voice which, broken like a \\textit{hamsa\u2019s}, seemed interrupted by a tinkle of anklets from the loved one taken to his heart, he spent that fair night in the fashion enjoined by K\u0101ma, taught by youth, [43] dictated by passion, and revealed by insight. Taking confidence, Sarasvat\u012b made herself known to him, and with her he spent a full year brief as a single day.\n\nThen by ordinance of destiny Sarasvat\u012b conceived, and bare in good time a son graced by all auspicious signs. Upon him at the very hour of his birth she laid this blessing, \u2018By my favour all the Vedas with the mystic portions, all authoritative books, and all arts shall be fully and spontaneously manifested in him.\u2019 Then bearing Dadh\u012bca in her heart as though to display him with the vaunt of an ideal spouse, she ascended by the Great Father\u2019s will with S\u0101vitr\u012b to Brahma\u2019s world. She having departed, Dadh\u012bca also, pierced to the heart as by a lightning flash, went away sick with his loss to the woods to live as an ascetic: having appointed as his son\u2019s foster-mother a hermit\u2019s daughter named Ak\u1e63am\u0101l\u0101, wife to Bh\u1e5bat\u1e5bi, a Br\u0101hma\u1e47 of the Bhrigu race. She had borne a son at the very hour when Sarasvat\u012b gave birth to hers. So the two children gradually grew up together, fed without favour at the same breast. The one was named S\u0101rasvata simply\\(^5\\), the other\u2019s name was Vatsa.\n\n---\n\n1 I.e. Sarasvati. The words may also mean \u201cthe creepers clinging to the sandal and grislea trees.\u201d\n2 The Moon.\n3 \\textit{Utkalik\u0101}=(1) wave, (2) agitation.\n4 Because of its whiteness.\n5 I.e. \u2018Sarasvati\u2019s son\u2019: \\textit{akhy\u0101} and \\textit{n\u0101ma} are here distinguished.\nAnd between the two there existed an enviable affection like that of brothers.\n\nNow S\u0101rasvata, who through his mother's power was at the very outset of youth gifted with the full treasure of the sciences, conveyed it undiminished in the form of words to his dear confidant and loving twin-brother Vatsa. When Vatsa took a wife, he made for him in that same neighbourhood a mansion endearingly named The Pinnacle of Delight: he himself, assuming the hermit's staff, black antelope skin, bark dress, rosary, girdle, and matted locks, went to join his father, the ascetic [44].\n\nFrom Vatsa there proceeded a prolific stock like Ganges purifying, noised abroad through the growing fame of the school established by its founders, upheld on the Almighty's head, deep in the lore of all arts, honoured of great saints, potent to shake its foes, stretching far over the earth's surface, stumbling not in its going\u00b2. Wherefrom were born home-dwelling sages named V\u0101tsy\u0101yanas, devoted to \u0106rauta lore yet assuming not the false muttering of cranes, vowed to the 'Cock' rules of fasting yet free from the ways of cats, averse to worldly pretence, bare of all wily, deceitful, guileful or boastful intent, discarding hypocrisy, trampling on dishonesty, tranquil in nature, free from sudden change, reluctant in heart to reprove others, cleansed from darkness by detachment from the three colours\u00b3, shaken clear of desire by deep thought, wavering not in soul, devoted to their followers, at rest from all the doubts of different schools, openers of all knotty points in the sense of books, poets, [45] eloquent, without envy, fond of charming speech, skilled in clever wit, versed in urbane ways, connoisseurs of dance, song and music, never surfeited with tradition, compassionate, pure through truth, honoured of the good, with hearts melting with a dew of\n\n\u00b9 This is probably the name of B\u0101na's home.\n\u00b2 The adjectives are all made by means of puns to apply both to the race and to the Ganges. This paragraph is full of untranslateable puns.\n\u00b3 Var\u1e47atraya 'the triad of colours,' red, white, and black, is a synonym for the material world: cf. \u0106vet\u0101\u015bv. Upanis., iv. 5.

Of whom Citrabh\u0101nu was blessed with a son B\u0101\u1e47a by a Br\u0101hma\u1e47\u012b woman named R\u0101jadev\u012b. The boy, while still a child, was deprived of his mother, who was taken away through the will of sovereign destiny. His father, however, conceiving a deep love for him acted a mother\u2019s part, and under his care the boy grew with ever increasing vigour in his own home.\n\nBut when, being now about fourteen years of age, he had passed through initiation and the associated rites, and had returned from his teacher\u2019s house\\(^3\\), his father also, having performed in full the sacred duties proper to the twice-born as enjoined in \u00c7ruti and Sm\u1e5biti, departed ere he reached the allotted span to his rest\\(^4\\). After his father\u2019s decease B\u0101\u1e47a in the anguish of a great sorrow, his heart all aflame by day and night, [47] passed some days, he knew not how, in his own house. When his sorrow gradually became less absorbing, he through indulgence in sundry youthful follies, due either to misconduct arising from independence, to the impetuosity prevalent in youth, or to the aversion of young manhood to steadiness, came into reproach\\(^5\\).

Their path was variegated with the scattered feathers of the darting blue jays,\u2014they seemed coloured by the live coals and sparks of the bursting red gunj\u0101-berries, as if they had caught the varied hues from the scorching torch of the sun\u2019s rays; waking up as they wandered the wild sounds of the mountain caves,\u2014skilled in preparing a magic potion to reduce the world to dust,\u2014propitiating the forest-fires with showers of the coral-tree\u2019s flowers as with offerings of blood,\u2014with their course bestarred with burning sand, and bedewed with melted bitumen from the heated rocks;

and he said to him, while he was yet some way off, \u201cIs all well with my honoured friend K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is the disinterested friend of all the world?\u201d He answered, \u201cAll is well\u201d; and then making his obeisance he sat down at some distance and said, after resting awhile, \u201cThis letter has been sent by our honoured lord,\u201d and he unloosed it and gave it. B\u0101\u1e47a took it respectfully and read it to himself. [59] \u201cWhen they have once learned the news from Mekhalaka, the wise will avoid all delay as hindering success\u201d; this is the real essence of the writing,\u2014all else is mere rhetorical compliment.\u201d Having mastered the contents of the letter and sent away his attendants, he asked for the message. Mekhalaka replied, \u201cMy lord thus addresses thee in thy wisdom, \u2018Your honour knows that the belonging to one gotra, or to one caste, or the being brought up together or the dwelling in one place or the constantly seeing each other, or the hearing of each other\u2019s mutual affection, or the conferring of benefits when absent, or a similarity of disposition can all be causes of affection; but without any cause my heart is tenderly affected with a firm love towards thee, even though thou art not seen by me and as though thou wert a relation near at hand when thou art really afar off, just as the moon feels towards the lotus-bed, however distant it may be. In thy absence the king was on various occasions prejudiced against thee by the malevolent; but it was not a true report. There are none so situated, but, even if they are good, they will have friends, neutrals, and enemies. Some unworthy remark was uttered concerning thee by some envious wretch through thy mind being not wholly averse to the levity of childhood, and others caught it up and repeated it. The minds of the unreflecting toss about, rolling to and\n\n1 Cf. the Persian phrase Ziy\u0101da ci bar-\u1e6dar\u0101zad. 2 Manu, vii. 158.\nfro like water. What now shall the lord of the earth do, when he comes to a settled decision after hearing many different suggestions? Though thou wast far away, yet thou wast immediately represented by us who sought to know the real truth. The sovereign has been reminded with regard to thee that 'every one's youth in the opening of life is usually guilty of some levities,' and he at once assented to the excuse. Therefore [60] your highness must repair to the palace without delay. I cannot approve thy habits, living as thou dost thus away from the king amidst thine own friends like a tree without fruit away from the sun's beams. Nor shouldst thou shrink from the toil of court-attendance or feel any fear of waiting upon him; for although it may be true enough, 'Alas! he who is unskilled in waiting upon a king is like K\u0101ma,\u2014he cannot speak out his request, although the opportunity is come exactly as he had wished,\u2014he gives pain (to his patron) by hundreds of ill-timed petitions for favours,\u2014and by his folly he throws away his livelihood in a moment';\u2014yet these other common kings are one thing, and our ambrosial lord is quite another, who puts to shame such ancient heroes as N\u1e5biga, Nala, Ni\u1e63adha, Nahu\u1e63a, Ambar\u012b\u1e63a, Da\u00e7aratha, Dilipa, N\u0101bh\u0101ga, Bharata, Bhag\u012bratha, and Yay\u0101ti. His eyes are not stained by the deadly poison of pride; his voice is not choked by the convulsive effects of the baneful drug of conceit; his postures do not lose their natural dignity through any sudden epileptic fit of forgetfulness caused by the heat of arrogance; his changes of feeling are not exaggerated by the fevered outbursts of ungovernable self-will; his gait is not agitated by the unnatural movements of an access of self-conceit; his voice is not rendered harsh by the words being uttered under a tetanus of hauteur which distorts his lips. Thus his idea of jewels attaches to men of pure virtues, [61] not to bits of rock,\u2014his taste delights in\n\n---\n\n1 These lines must be read with a series of puns, when taken as referring to K\u0101ma. \"Although his realm and power are sprung from fancy, K\u0101ma cannot be called 'corporeal' (dehi),\u2014he gives pain to lovers by his hundreds of arrows\u2014and by his folly he sacrifices his life in a moment consumed by \u00c7iva's anger.\" Samkalpaja is one of the names of K\u0101ma.\npearl-like qualities, not in heaps of ornaments,\u2014his judgment as to proper means is versed in deeds of bounty, not in the ichor-flowing temples of poor worms of elephants\u00b9,\u2014his highest love is for preeminent glory, not for the withering stubble of this life,\u2014his magnificence is devoted to adorning the different quarters of the earth whose tribute he seizes, not the dolls which he calls his wives,\u2014his notion of bosom friendship belongs to his well-strung bow, not to the courtiers who live on the crumbs of his board. His natural instinct is to help his friends, sovereignty means to him helping his dependants, learning at once suggests helping the learned and success helping his kinsfolk, power means helping the unfortunate and wealth helping the br\u0101hmans; his heart\u2019s main occupation is to remember benefits and his life\u2019s sole employment is to assist virtue, his body\u2019s one use is to carry out the dictates of courage, and the earth\u2019s to be an arena for his sword, attendant kings are wanted to amuse him, and enemies to help his majesty to shew itself. It could have been by no common merits in former births that he attained this glorious preeminence so that the shadow of his feet diffuses an all-excelling ambrosia of happiness round him.\u201d\n\nHaving heard this, he said to Candrasena, \u201cRefresh the messenger with food and clothing, and then let him rest\u201d [62]. When he was gone and the day had come to a close, and the afternoon sunshine, crimson like a young crow\u2019s beak, was fading away as if drunk up by the cups of the closely joined red lotuses, and when the sun, as the speed of his horses was relaxed,\u2014pale-pink like a garland of China roses,\u2014seemed to limp as if he stumbled on the western mountain, as though his feet had been pierced by the (fancied) thorns of the lotus-beds,\u2014he offered his evening prayers and retired to his couch, as the early night was hurrying on in the east, her long locks of scattered darkness seeming to hang dangling in the air, and her face as it were dark with sorrow for the moon\u2019s absence. He pondered by himself, \u201cWhat shall I do?\n\n\u00b9 Elephants are one of the component parts of an army (s\u0101dhan\u0101); of course there is also a pun on d\u0101na.\nI have indeed been misunderstood by the king, and this advice has been given by my disinterested kinsman K\u1e5bi\u1e63\u1e47a; but all service is hateful, and attendance is full of evils, and a court is full of dangers. My ancestors never had any love for it, I have no hereditary connection with it,\u2014nor is mine the consideration from remembering former benefits, nor the affection caused by service rendered when a child, nor family dignity, nor the kindness of old acquaintance, nor the allurement of mutually imparting information, nor the desire of more knowledge, nor the respect paid to one\u2019s fine appearance, nor practice in all the turns of voice fit for inferiors, nor the cleverness needed in the circles of the learned, nor the skill to win friends by the expenditure of wealth, nor long intercourse with royal favourites. Still I must certainly go. Pur\u0101r\u0101ti, the venerable guru of the world, will do everything that is proper when I am away.\u201d Thus having considered, he made up his mind for the journey.\n\nThe next day, having risen and bathed betimes, and put on a dress of white silk and seized his rosary and repeatedly recited the hymns and sacred texts fit for one starting on a journey,\u2014after washing the image with milk\u00b9, he offered worship to \u00c7iva, with lighted lamps, ointments, oblations, banners, perfumes, incense and sweet flowers [63]. Then, having offered a libation with profound reverence to the holy fire\u00b2, whose right flame was kindled by a profuse pouring of ghi, and whose fiery crest was noisily crackling with the splitting husks of the restless mustard seeds, which had been previously offered, he distributed wealth according to his means to the br\u0101hmans, and walked solemnly round a sacred cow which faced the east, himself decked with white unguents, and wearing white garlands and white garments, and having his ears adorned with giri-kar\u1e47ik\u0101 flowers, fastened with the ends of d\u016brv\u0101-grass, and covered with yellow rocana paint,\u2014and having white mustard put on his topknot. All the rites necessary at starting on a journey were\n\n\u00b9 Cf. Bk. v.

So in a favourable moment,\u2014looking upon a full water-jar that was set in the court-yard which was daubed with brown cow-dung,\u2014with a mango-spray placed on its mouth, itself white with five finger-breadths of flour\u00b2, and with its neck encircled by a garland of white flowers;\u2014having paid his homage to the family deities and being followed by his own br\u0101hmans with their hands holding flowers and fruits and muttering the apratiratha hymn\u00b3,\u2014he went out from the village of Pr\u012btik\u016b\u1e6da, setting his right foot first.\n\nOn the first day, having slowly passed through a grove sacred to Cand\u012bk\u0101 which was parched and waterless from the hot season, and ugly with leafless trees,\u2014with figures of the goddess carved on the trees at the entrance, which received the homage of passing travellers [64],\u2014though dried up, yet seeming to be sprouting with the thousands of red tongues which hung lolling from the mouths of the thirsty wild beasts,\u2014all astir with the swarms of bees flying out of the masses of honeycomb as they were licked by the monkeys and bears,\u2014and bristling with the hundreds of new shoots of stout asparagus which had sprung up luxuriantly from the burned soil\u2074,\u2014he arrived at last at the village Mallak\u016b\u1e6da.\n\n\u00b9 Called here Mah\u0101\u00e7vet\u0101.\n\u00b2 The Comm. seems to explain pi\u1e63\u1e6dapa\u00f1c\u0101\u1e45gulam (cf. text, p. 157. 7) as flour daubed on with the five fingers moistened with goat's-milk (\u0101jakakt\u0101bh\u012b), but cf.

(Balfour's Bot.)\nThere he stayed happily, hospitably received by his brother and his friend Jagatpati who was just like his own heart. The next day, having crossed the holy Bh\u0101girathi, he passed the night in a forest-village named Ya\u1e63\u1e6dig\u1e5bihaka\\(^1\\), and the next he arrived at the royal camp, which was pitched near Ma\u1e47it\u0101ra along the Ajiravat\u012b river; and he stopped near the royal residence.\n\nHaving bathed and eaten his meal and rested, when only one watch of three hours remained of the day, and when the king had dined, he proceeded leisurely with Mekhalaka to the royal gate, one by one observing the many camps of the renowned subject kings. Here the royal gate was all dark with crowds of elephants,\u2014some brought to carry turbans of honour, others to bear drums, some newly bound, others acquired as tribute or as presents, some sent by the rangers of the elephants\u2019 district, or brought in the excitement of a first visit to the court or sent at the time of an embassy or presented by the lord of a wild settlement or demanded for the spectacle of a mimic battle, or given or taken by force, or let loose, or set ready for a watch, or collected to conquer all continents like so many mountains to make a bridge over the ocean,\u2014all gay with banners, cloths, kettledrums, conchs, chowries, and unguents, like so many ready-made festival-days for the royal ceremonies when the moon enters the asterism Pushya [65]. The place seemed all in waves with the plunging horses as they leaped up to the sky in anger against the horses of the sun\u2019s chariot, with their chowries and ornaments serving as wings, and challenged Indra\u2019s horse to a contest by their joyous neigh, and mocked the whole race of deer as too laggard of foot, with the foam curling round the corners of their mouths like a scornful laugh, and set the Royal Prosperity herself a-dancing as the drum of the ground was struck by their ceaselessly prancing hoofs\\(^2\\).\n\nIn another part it was tawny with troops of camels sent\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Bombay ed.

A thousand Yamun\u0101s seemed to be flowing from the radiance of the emeralds, while the flashes of the rubies gleamed like charcoal.\n\n[67] The camp was filled on every side with conquered hostile vassal-chiefs,\u2014some who could not find admission hung down their heads and seemed in their shame to sink into their own bodies through the reflections of their faces which fell on their toe-nails,\u2014others seemed to present chowries in obsequious service under the form of the rays issuing from their nails, which were thrown back from the ground which was scratched by their bare fingers,\u2014others with the flashing sapphires hanging on their breasts seemed to be carrying sword-blades suspended from their necks to propitiate their lord's anger,\u2014others with their faces darkened by the swarms of bees which flocked attracted by their perfumed breath were as if they wore their beards long as in mourning for their lost prosperity,\u2014others with circles of bees flying up round their crests as if their topknots were flying away afraid of the coming mortification of paying homage,\u2014honoured even in being conquered, and destitute of every other refuge,\u2014continually asking the servants of the different domestic porters who at intervals made their exits and their entrances, and whose track was followed by thousands of various suppliants,\u2014\u201cGood sir, will it be to-day? will the great lord give an audience in the hall\nafter he has dined? or will he come out into the outer court?\" and thus spending the day in the hope of an audience.\n\nOther kings too were there, come from the desire of seeing his glory, natives of various countries, who were waiting for the time when he would be visible. There were also seated by themselves Jains, \u0100rhatas, P\u0101\u00e7upatas, mendicants of the school of Par\u0101\u00e7arya, Br\u0101hman students, natives of every land, and savages from every forest that fringes the ocean-shore, and ambassadors from every foreign country. It seemed like a creation-ground where the Praj\u0101patis practised their skill, or a fourth world made out of the choicest parts of the other three; its glory could not be described in hundreds of Mah\u0101bh\u0101ratas,\u2014it must have been put together in a thousand golden ages,[68] and its perfection constructed with millions of svargas, and it seemed watched over by crores of tutelary royal deities.\n\nIn his astonishment he thought to himself, \"Surely such a vast multitude of living beings as this must have involved to the creating Principles a destruction of the elements or a lack of atoms or a failure of time or a cessation of vital power or an exhaustion of possible forms!\" But Mekhalaka, being recognised from afar by the doorkeepers, asked him to wait a while, and himself pressed forward unrepelled and entered.\n\nThen in a moment he came out, followed by a tall man fair like a kar\u1e47ik\u0101ra flower, clothed in a clean jacket, with his waist tightly bound by a girdle ornamented with a quantity of flashing rubies,\u2014with his chest broad like a rock of Mount Him\u0101laya, and having his shoulder rising over it like the hump of \u00c7iva's bull,\u2014and carrying on his breast a string of pearls like a noose to tame the whole restless race of deer,\u2014and gleaming with two jewelled ear-rings at his ear, as if they were the sun and moon brought to be asked whether even a king of the solar or lunar race were such as our king?\u2014while the sunbeams seemed to give place to him through respect for his office, as though they were rebuked before the stream of beauty which flowed from his face. He greeted B\u0101\u1e47a from afar with his long eye as if it were a\nwreath of full-blossomed lotuses taken up as an offering\u00b9, \u2014set in the very centre of stern discipline and yet, with his topknot bent down to the ground, lifting his white turban as a token of respect, [69] and grasping in his left hand his sword, its handle rough with the pearls which thickly studded it, and in his right his burnished golden staff of office like a lightning-flash suddenly become motionless. Having come out, Mekhalaka said to him, \u201cThis is the chief of all the doorkeepers, the king\u2019s special favourite P\u0101riy\u0101tra; let him who pursues success treat him with suitable ceremony.\u201d The doorkeeper, having come up and saluted him, addressed him respectfully in a gentle voice, \u201cApproach and enter, his highness is willing to see you.\u201d Then B\u0101\u1e47a entered, as he directed, saying, \u201cI am indeed happy that he thinks me worthy of this honour.\u201d\n\nHe next beheld a stable filled with the king\u2019s favourite horses from Van\u0101yu, \u0100ra\u1e6d\u1e6da, Kamboja, Bharadv\u0101ja, Sindh, and Persia,\u2014red, dark, white, bay, chestnut, dappled like partridges, marked with the five auspicious kinds of marks\u00b2, with eyes spotted with white, or marked with light yellow spots in groups like the Pleiads; with long thin jaws and short ears, and round delicate well-proportioned throats, [70] with long upraised curved necks like sacrificial posts, with their shoulders stout and robust at the joints, their chests full and projecting, their legs thin and straight, and their round hoofs hard like masses of iron; their round bellies seemed solid, as if they had no entrails within them, lest they should be broken by their excessive swiftness, and their broad flanks were divided by a long depression\u00b3, with the hairs like new shoots swaying about in the wind\u2074. They were with difficulty restrained by the ropes fixed tightly in the ground on both sides, and they seemed to grow longer as they struggled with one foot thrust out of the ropes\u2019 confinement, and the studs on their necks were ornamented with cords of many\n\n\u00b9 Cf. p. 25, l. 27.\n\u00b2 Sc. on the chest, back, face and flanks.\n\u00b3 Dro\u1e47\u012b is doubtful,\u2014there is a reading udyacchro\u1e47\u012b.\n\u2074 Jagat\u012b seems to be used for jagat in this rare sense.\nstrings,\u2014their eyes were closed, and they kept moving their mouths, which were flecked with bits of foam dark with the juice of d\u016brv\u0101 grass, while the skin itched and twitched about and was bitten for a moment and then let go by the teeth. Some stood, lazily moving their tails, with one side of their loins drooping as they rested on one hoof, seeming to ponder in sleep, and slowly uttering interrupted neighs, while the ground was marked by their hoofs, whose foreparts rattled with the noise of their foot-rests as they struck upon them; others sought for food, having their longing excited by the stray morsels of fodder scattered about, [71] while the pupils of their eyes trembled for fear at the yells of the angry Cand\u0101las who guarded them. They seemed to have a lustration-fire always near to protect them, from their bodies being yellow with a saffron unguent rubbed on them, while an awning was spread over them and the tutelary deity (Govinda) was worshipped before them. As he looked, his mind was filled with curious wonder, and he entered a little further within, and saw on his left hand an elephant-stable indistinct owing to the distance, but regaling the nostrils with an odour as of groves of vakula trees\u00b9 in full bloom which diffused itself far and wide, while the stable was filled with streams of ichor covered with bees, and its outskirts were surrounded by a grove of plantain-trees\u00b2, and its height seemed to crowd the very sky.\n\nHe asked \u201cWhat does the king do here?\u201d The other replied, \u201cThis is his majesty\u2019s favourite elephant, his external heart, his very self in another birth\u00b3, his vital airs gone outside from him, his friend in battle and in sport, rightly named Darpa\u00e7\u0101ta\u2074, a lord of elephants\u2014this is his special pavilion.\u201d He replied, \u201cO my friend, if he is called Darpa\u00e7\u0101ta and he has no faults, I may surely see this lord of elephants,\u2014will you take me to him, for I am overcome by curiosity?\u201d \u201cBe it so,\u201d he answered, \u201cdraw near by all\n\n\u00b9 From the mada or ichor exuding from the elephants\u2019 temples.\n\u00b2 Kadal\u012b also means \u2018a flag carried by an elephant.\u2019\n\u00b3 Or \u2018veiled by a new nature.\u2019\n\u2074 \u2018Keen (or perhaps attenuated and so lacking) in pride.\u2019\nmeans, what harm is there in it? have a good look at the lord of elephants.\"\n\n[72] So he went forward in that direction, and there while he was still at a distance he saw the elephant Darpa\u00e7\u0101ta surrounded by the troops of c\u0101taka birds uttering their loud notes in the sky as they were excited by the deep sound issuing from his throat (which suggested clouds), and the domestic peacocks which made the ground resound with their cries,\u2014filling the surrounding space with the spirituous scent of the ichor which rivalled the full-blown kadamba flowers,\u2014like a rainy season out of its time wearing an embodied form,\u2014throwing off the fourth period of life by an outburst of red spots on his skin like a lake covered with lotuses brown with thick drops of honey,\u2014chanting as it were a tune for his auspicious entrance upon the fifth period with his shell-ornaments as they mingled with the deep sound of his flapping ears,\u2014seeming as if for fear of bursting the earth he tried to lighten his weight by swinging his long huge body with sportive oscillations on his three feet as they kept varying in constant motion, as though he were rubbing his body against the walls of the world,\u2014challenging the world-bearing elephants of the various regions as he threw up his trunk in defiance, and seeming to be cleaving the pillar of the world with a saw armed with thick sharp teeth. It was as though the world could not contain him and he was striving to force a passage out, while his drivers tried to shew him every service which could alleviate the hot season, some\\(^1\\) like clouds with long-accumulated stores, hurrying up with fresh juicy shoots and creepers, others like lakes whose waters are variegated with heaps of Vallisneria plants and lotus fibres scattered on them.\n\n[73] He threatened to block up the whole world with all its mountain-ranges, seas, continents and forests, with his huge bar of a trunk, which was all wavy with thin lines of wrinkles running round it as if they were marks to reckon up the number of past victories which he had won in battle, while it was held aloft as if he scented the ichor of some rival\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Read lesakai\u1e25.\nelephant approaching,\u2014one of his tusks had its root wet with spray from a thick piece of plaintain covered with leaves which was enclosed in the trunk, the other seemed to have dropped its bough and was as it were all horripilated with the joy of battle from a quantity of lotus fibres which hung from it in play. He appeared to vomit whole beds of lotuses which he had eaten in his gambols in the lake, through the bright colour of the two tusks together, and spread his own glory through the four quarters of space; and he seemed to laugh to scorn the lions who vaunted their rough play with some poor scarecrows of elephants whom they had worsted, while he appropriated for himself a silken veil which might have been taken direct from the heavenly tree. When he lifted up in play his huge trunk, he seemed to drop a shower of red lotuses which he had eaten, or to vomit a quantity of fresh shoots, as he then displayed his palate which was soft to the touch like red silk. His bright tawny eyes seemed to emit a stream of honey which he had drunk up with the mouthfuls of lotuses, while his cheeks poured out under the guise of ichor a rich mixture of perfumes as if he had been eating groves of the p\u0101rij\u0101ta tree of heaven, together with mangoes, campakas, lavalis, cloves, kakkolas, cardamoms, and sahak\u0101ras, and perfumed with abundance of camphor. He seemed to be busy, night and day, bestowing all the woods on the other elephants by royal inscriptions of donation, made vocal with the swarms of bees which hummed round them as if reading them, and scratched by the half-cut branches of red sugar-cane as by a graver, and which seemed by a mistake to stay on hand instead of being dispersed abroad\u00b9; [74] he was constantly cooled by a trickling garland of ornaments cut out of the moongem\u00b2 in the shape of the constellations, and he carried his head high as if it had been crowned with the tiara of universal empire.\n\n\u00b9 This sentence is very obscure; hasta-sthiti seems to imply a pun, as hasta means 'hand' or 'trunk'; the trunk is as it were marked all over with lines which the bees seem to be reading aloud. There is also the usual pun in d\u0101na as meaning \"patches of ichor,\" and in vibhrama as 'mistake' and 'haste.'\n\n\u00b2 Or perhaps 'ice.'\nover all his compeers; he stood as though he were loyally fanning the Guardian deity of the royal family who lay pillowed on his tusks, with his huge ears, which, as they flapped, seemed alternately to conceal and reveal the wide world; while his tail waved like some flyflapper marked with the signs of elephant-empire and handed down through a long succession of hereditary rulers\\(^1\\). He seemed to pour out again from his mouth the rivers which he had drunk up in his triumphal progress of conquest, in the form of the clear cold water which he spouted forth; and he displayed his sensitiveness to insult by loud trumpetings which followed various movements of his body as he heard the drums borne by other elephants, while all his limbs had been motionless for a moment as he listened attentively. He seemed to pity himself for not being in the thick of the fray, and as if ashamed of the humiliation of bearing a driver he poured out streams of ichor and scratched the ground with the tip of his trunk; his eyes were a third closed as with the languor of intoxication, when his driver shouted angrily, as he scornfully took up and dropped the mouthfuls of food, and finally took them slowly and reluctantly, [75] while the juice issued from his mouth discoloured, like a stream of ichor, by the dark juice of the tam\u0101la boughs which he had eaten. He moved restlessly with pride, he snorted with repressed energy, he swelled with intoxication, he staggered with youth, he flowed freely with ichor, he leaped about with conscious strength, he was drunk with arrogance, he seemed to be ever seeking the highest place with ambition, he gasped with excitement, he affected all with his gracefulness, he rained influence on every side by his beauty.\n\nHis nails were smooth, his hair was rough,\u2014he was reverend in face but a gentle disciple in deportment; soft as to his head, but firm in his friendships; his neck was short but his life was long; he was stinted in his belly but lavishly bounteous in ichor; a very Balar\u0101ma in his wild\n\n\\(^1\\) Ayatavam\u00e7a can also suggest a pun as meaning \u2018the backbone.\u2019\nexploits, but like a highborn wife in his devotedness; a Jina in patience, a shower of fire in his storms of anger; he was Garu\u1e0da in his power to lift n\u0101gas\u00b9, he was N\u0101rada in his love of quarrels\u00b2, a thunderbolt without rain in his sudden attacks, a Makara in his power to disturb armies\u00b3, a serpent in the might of his teeth, Varu\u1e47a in the noose which he held in his hand, he was Yama\u2019s net in entangling his enemies, he was Time in his buttings\u2074, R\u0101hu in his grip\u2075, Mars in his crooked movements, a circling torch in his rapid rounds. He was to valour, a very mountain of the jewel which gives all desires; to chivalrous feeling, a palace-home with his tusks for two pillars of pearl; [76] to magnanimity, a heavenly chariot, moving at will, and gay with ornaments, chowries, and bells; to anger, a shower-bath of scented water, dark with a constant raincloud of ichor; to ambition, a temple with a golden image\u2076 within; to pride, a pleasure-hill with streams running down its sides; to arrogance, a diamond house with an arch of ivory; to royalty, a moving hill-fort with its high frontal-globes as so many towers; to the earth, an iron wall indented with thousands of arrows\u2077; to the king\u2078, a tree of heaven, resonant with hundreds of bees. Thus he was a music-hall for the dancing of his flapping ears, a drinking-saloon for the swarms of bees, a gynaeceum for the display of paint and decorations\u2079, a festival of K\u0101ma for the sportive gambols of intoxication, a faultless evening for the sight of all the constellations\u00b9\u2070; a\n\n\u00b9 i.e. \u2018elephants\u2019 or \u2018snakes.\u2019\n\u00b2 N\u0101rada is expressly called kalahapriya and kalik\u0101raka.

It is indeed a marvel,\u2014a Vindhya with tusks, the primeval Boar with a trunk!\u201d\u2014the doorkeeper addressed him; \u201cSee! when his enemies, wandering in the forests, would vainly try\\(^2\\) by a hundred wishes to paint again their old glory gone without leaving a rack behind, and when their minds are bewildered with devising means to express their imaginations,\u2014[77] this lord of elephants, if he comes by chance into their recollection as they listlessly muse in despondency, cannot endure as rivals even the world-supporting elephants in the M\u0101nasa lake\\(^3\\).\u2014But come, you will have another opportunity of seeing him; you shall now see my lord himself!\u201d\n\nOn hearing these words he with an effort drew away his eyes which had fallen on the elephant\u2019s ichor-bedewed cheek and were half closed as if intoxicated with the sweet odour; and, following the path indicated by the doorkeeper, he passed through three courts crowded with subject-kings, and in the fourth he saw King Har\u1e63a, in an open space in front of a pavilion where he used to give audience after eating, surrounded at a distance by his attendants in a line, all six feet in height\\(^4\\), fair like karnik\u0101ra flowers, armed and of old families\\(^5\\), like so many golden pillars,\u2014with his special favourites seated near him. He was sitting on a throne made of a stone clear like a pearl, washed with sandalwood water, and bright as the moon with its feet\\(^6\\) of ivory\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Which is like that of the ichor.\n\n\\(^2\\) The Kashmir edition rightly reads \u0101likhat\u0101m.\n\n\\(^3\\) Or \u2018even the elephants of hope in their minds.\u2019\n\n\\(^4\\) Or \u2018their bodies tall through exercise.\u2019\n\n\\(^5\\) Or of the pillars, \u2018shaped by tools and firmly set.\u2019\n\n\\(^6\\) Or \u2018rays.\u2019\nand its surface cool to the touch like snow-water,\u2014he rested the weight of his body on his arm which was placed on the end of the seat, and he seemed to be sporting with his subject-kings under the far-shining canopy of the brightness of his body with the rays of his jewels diffused round, as if it were in a lake delightful in the hot season, the water of which was tangled with clusters of the long soft lotus-roots; and he seemed made as it were out of the pure atoms of light.\n\n[78] He was embraced by the goddess of the Royal Prosperity, who took him in her arms and, seizing him by all the royal marks on all his limbs, forced him, however reluctant, to mount the throne,\u2014and this though he had taken a vow of austerity and did not swerve from his vow, hard like grasping the edge of a sword\u00b9; clinging closely to duty through fear of stumbling in the uneven path of kings, and attended with all her heart by Truth who had been abandoned by all other kings, but had obtained his promise of protection,\u2014and waited on reverentially by the reflected images of a fair handmaid standing near, which fell on his toe-nails, as if they were the ten directions of space impersonate\u00b2. With his long glances which penetrated space he seemed to examine what the Regents of the different quarters had done or left undone, while the sun seemed to seek his permission to rise, as its beams rested on the back of his footstool supported by jewelled feet,\u2014the day made its reverential march round him, while a clear space was kept in the centre, marked out by the splendour emitted from his ornaments; he burned with vexation when even the mountains did not bow before him, and so displayed the ocean of his beauty which was white like sandal-wood, boiling as it were into foam through the heat of his heroic passion,\u2014in his isolated sovereignty feeling indignant that his own image should be repeated even in the reflections on the crest jewels of the prostrate kings round his feet, and keeping his Royal Glory continually sighing under the guise of the wind of his chowries as she sat fuming with vexed pride; [79] he was embraced by the Goddess \u00c7r\u012b who came\n\n\u00b9 Cf. Raghuv. xiii. 67. \u00b2 As reflected in the ten nails.\nto him after spoiling all the four oceans of their beauty\\(^1\\); though he gave away thousands of rainbows from the coruscations of his ornaments and sent them as a present to Indra, yet he still in his seeming penury\\(^2\\) rained ambrosia in his interviews with other monarchs; in poetical contests he poured out a nectar of his own which he had not received from any foreign source; he ever shewed his heart in his confidential intercourse even when it was not sought; when he shewed favour, he seemed to place Glory, though herself immoveable, in various positions by his patronage; in the parleys of heroes he seemed listening to the whispered kindly counsels of the Goddess of battles with his cheek horripilated in joy; during the recital of the past conflicts of heroes, he ever turned his eye like a shower of soft cleansing oil on the loved sword; in easy jests flashing from his bright teeth his clear meaning to the circle of kings standing awed by his majesty: abiding in the hearts of all the world and yet never leaving his own proper place; in his greatness, he was beyond the sphere of all good qualities, out of the range of ordinary successes, outside of common benefactions, beyond the possibility of blessing, out of the reach of desires, far removed from fortune, not within the scope of comparisons, out of the influence of fate, and beyond the past experience of prosperity. He displayed an avat\u0101ra of all the gods united in one, as he had the lost delicate feet of Aru\u1e47a\\(^3\\), the slow-moving thighs of Buddha, the brawny forearm of the Thunderer (Indra), the shoulder of Justice\\(^4\\), the round lip of the sun, the mild look of Avalokita\\(^5\\), the face of the moon and the hair of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.

His feet were very red as with wrath at unsubmitive kings, and they shed a very bright ruby-light on the crowded crests of the prostrate monarchs, and caused a sunset of all the fierce luminaries of war and poured streams of honey from the flowers of the crest garlands of the local kings, and were never even for one moment unattended, as by the heads of slain enemies, by swarms of bees which fluttered bewildered at the sweet odour of the chaplets on the heads of all the feudal chiefs; and they formed as it were sylvan summer-houses of full-blown red lotuses for the Goddess \u00c7r\u012b to shelter in as she acted as his shampooer, and bore signs which told of his sovereignty over the four oceans in their auspicious marks, such as the lotus, the shell, the fish and the makara. His two thighs were like two ruby pillars, set to bear the weight of the earth which rested on his heart, like two sandal-trees with their roots shining with the rays from the crest-jewels of the serpents clustered round them, or like two streams from the ocean of beauty overflowing and all covered with foam, or like two huge tusks of a world-bearing elephant, bent through being used to block up a yawning makara\u2019s mouth\\(^2\\). He shone, like the mountain Mandara with V\u0101suki\u2019s skin\\(^3\\) at the churning of the ocean, with his lower garment which was radiant with shot silk-threads, washed in pure water, clinging closely to his loins, ornamented with the rays of the jewels of his girdle, and white like a mass of ambrosial foam,\u2014while he appeared girt with his thin upper garment spangled with worked stars like the round world with its surrounding ether cloudless and full\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Cf.

[81] He shone with his broad chest, like Kail\u0101sa with a cliff of crystal,\u2014able to bear the shock of various armies, too sturdy to be confined within the limits of its garment\\(^1\\), and made smooth in spite of its hardness by the thousands of elephants\u2019 tusks which had collided against it. His neck was encircled by a necklace of pearls like the serpent \u00c7e\u1e63a, now sleeping peacefully in the sense of relief at depositing the burden of the whole earth on his stalwart arm, or like the dividing-line which draws the boundary between the respective empires of \u00c7r\u012b and Sarasvat\u012b over his bosom and face. His breast was wrapped in a fold of rays from the pearls in his necklace as if it were a strip of cloth put on to signify the solemn conferring as a special gift of all the property gained during one\u2019s whole life\\(^2\\); he was like a jewel mountain, with its outstretched wings of jewels, spread on both sides,\u2014with the red rays of the bracelets as if they were the paths for the passage of the glory produced by his arm or the continued streams of honey from the lotuses in the ears of \u00c7r\u012b as she lay on the pillow of his arm, or as if they were other arms newly budding forth in rivalry of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u\u2019s four arms. He at once destroyed the greatness of the four regions of space and their rulers by his two long arms, which were as the bolts to blockade the path\\(^3\\) through the world-encircling Lok\u0101loka, and as the rock-walls built outside the moats of the four oceans, and as a cage of adamant to confine all illustrious kings, and as a jewelled triumphal arch for the festal entrance of the world\u2019s goddess of Victory. The redness of his lip bedewed all the regions of space like the exudation of a branch of the heavenly tree, and the lip itself seemed as if it were the Kaustubha gem, taking its place as a feature of his face in its desire to kiss its sister Lak\u1e63m\u012b\\(^4\\) who sat enthroned there. He displayed at intervals a sudden flash of illumination to the Goddess of Empire who was somewhat dull and bewildered by nature, through the\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Or \u2018the shock of rivers\u2019 and \u2018the limits of the sky\u2019 (ambara).\n\n\\(^2\\) The Comm. does not explain the ceremony which this refers to.\n\n\\(^3\\) Cf.

With the brightness of his milk-white eye he deluged the regions of space as with a full tide of the milky ocean at the rising of his unparalleled moon-face,\u2014and the chowrie-woman, as reflected in his stainless cheeks, seemed to be Sarasvat\u012b who inhabited his mouth taking bodily shape; while his broad forehead was reddened by the pink hue of his crest-ornament, as if it were the lac dye of Lak\u1e63m\u012b\u2019s feet which had clung to it, when he sought by prostration to appease her jealousy at the preference shewn to Sarasvat\u012b. He was listening, like one skilled in music to lute-players, to the tribes of bees in his ear-rings, which with restless feet played a tiny lyre consisting of the end of his ear-ring jewel with the web of its rosy rays for strings; while his locks were encircled by a wreath of white jasmine flowers mimicking Durg\u0101\u2019s wreath of skulls, and serving as a halo round his moon-face, like a circle of moonlight from the nails of the Goddess of Empire, which had remained behind as she grasped his hair in amorous play. He was consecrated by the light of the pearls in his top-knot and the dark rays of the emeralds, as they crossed in their intermingling, as if the braid-like streams of the united Yamun\u0101 and Ganges had come of their own accord from Pray\u0101ga.\n\nHis imperial splendour was however eclipsed by the women, as their foreheads became blackened by the darkness produced through the ornamental tilaka of black agallochum being melted by the drops of perspiration, as if it were a dark mark produced by their repeated prostrations at his\nfeet to incline him to grant their coaxing requests,\u2014[83] propped up\\(^1\\), as they were, by their flashing pearl-necklaces which were like so many waves rising from the tossed M\u0101nasa lake\\(^2\\),\u2014seeming in jealousy to rebuke \u010cri herself by the action of their creeper-like eyebrows, tremulous with a playful motion,\u2014dragging him captive as with bonds by their long sweet-scented sighs which seemed made of the Malaya wind,\u2014with their great jar-like bosoms, encircled with bands of large Vakula flowers, drawing from him every drop of contentment with his own proper spouse,\u2014violently dragging him into their hearts, by the attraction of the rays of the trembling jewels of the necklaces which were set in motion by the trembling of their bosoms,\u2014embracing him, as with many outstretched arms, with the rays of their far-flashing ornaments,\u2014keeping their minds back, as it were, which had started off too impetuously, with their open hands which served as a covering over their mouths which wore an additional grace from a languid yawn,\u2014skilfully moving their eyes which were half-closed as fainting at the arrows of K\u0101ma and had their corners contracted on account of the pollen of the flowers in their ears, shaken by the bees which flew about blinded by intoxication,\u2014striking the lotuses in their own ears with the sidelong glances of their eyes shot from under the play of their frowns through their mutual jealousy,\u2014carrying the king reflected in their soft cheeks, as if he had been drunk up by their eyes whose lashes were motionless with the flood of joy\\(^3\\) born of their unblinking gaze,\u2014creating for love's assistance new moon-rises by their involuntary smiles through the playfulness of desire,\u2014and seeming as in anger to break ever so many of K\u0101ma's useless bows in the form of the rays of the curved nails as the joints of their fingers gave a loud crack when their twined hands, as they gesticulated, came into close contact in the rapid bendings of their limbs. He lay smiling, while he languidly struck on the head with the bow of\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Cf. *fultam*, Pers. i. 78.\n\n\\(^2\\) Or 'like so many longing regrets rising in the mind.'\n\n\\(^3\\) The Kashmir ed. reads *r\u0101\u00e7i*-.\na lute the shampooing attendant, as his lotus feet dropped from her spray-like hands which were trembling in her perspiring emotion; [84] while he taught the Goddess of Empire as well as the lute (both equally dear) while each had its kona\\(^1\\) firmly grasped in his hand. Single as he lay there, he was viewed in very different lights by different spectators,\u2014riches called him cold, all faults turned from him as inaccessible, the senses felt awed at his love of self-control, the genius of the iron age said \u2018he is beyond my reach,\u2019 all vices pronounced him as passionless, dishonour looked on him as timid; Love said, \u2018the workings of his mind are hard to be understood\u2019; Sarasvat\u012b complained that \u2018he is uxorious\u2019\\(^2\\), other men\u2019s wives that \u2018he is impotent\u2019; ascetics said that \u2018he is a seer of the highest order,\u2019 harlots that \u2018he is a deceiver\u2019; his friends thought that \u2018he is easily led by others\u2019; Br\u0101hmans that \u2018he is our ready servant\u2019; and his enemies\u2019 soldiers that \u2018he has faithful allies.\u2019 More truly the lord of V\u0101hini\\(^3\\) than \u00c7antanu\\(^4\\), more illustrious for victory\\(^5\\) than Bh\u012b\u1e63ma, more delighting in the bow\\(^6\\) than Dro\u1e47a, more unerring with the arrow\\(^7\\) than Agyatth\u0101man, dearer to Mitra\\(^8\\) than Kar\u1e47a, more forbearing\\(^9\\) than Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, possessing the might of more elephants than Bh\u012bma, more worthy of figuring in the war of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata than Arjuna.

Through him the earth does indeed possess a true King! His youthful exploits, unlike K\u1e5bi\u1e63\u1e47a's, transgress not right\u00b9; [86] his freaks of power cause no offence to the man of refinement\u00b2 as did those of \u00c7iva; his boasts lead to no destruction of families as did those of Indra to that of the cowpens\u00b3; unlike Yama, he is not too fond of wielding the rod of punishment; unlike Varu\u1e47a, his treasure-houses are not guarded by thousands of pitiless sea-monsters\u2074; unlike Kuvera, seeking an interview with him is never fruitless; unlike Jina, the sight of him is never without solid result\u2075;\n\n\u00b9 V\u1e5bi\u1e63a may also mean a demon slain by K\u1e5bi\u1e63\u1e47a, cf.

Should we read arth\u0101patti, as the Jainas do not accept this as a pram\u0101\u1e47a?\nunlike the Moon, his glories do not wane. Wonderful is his royalty, surpassing the gods! His liberality cannot find range enough in suppliants, nor his knowledge in doctrines to be learned; his poetical skill finds words fail, as his valour lacks opportunities to exercise it; his energy wants scope and his fame sighs for a wider horizon, his kindly nature seeks in vain more hearts to win, his virtues exhaust the powers of number, and all the fine arts\\(^1\\) are too narrow a field for his genius.\n\nUnder this monarch are found only the cloths worn by devotees in meditation, and not forged documents\\(^2\\); the royal figures of sculptors and not the vulgar disputes with kings; only bees quarrel in collecting dews (\\textit{dues}\\(^3\\)); the only feet ever cut off are those in metre; only chessboards teach the positions of the four 'members'\\(^4\\); there is no cutting off the four principal limbs of condemned criminals; only snakes hate Garu\u1e0da the king of birds (\\textit{dvija-guru}), no one hates Br\u0101hmans or gurus; and the followers of the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e41s\u0101 alone have to ponder problems in administering justice (\\textit{adhikara\u1e47a}), while they examine the several \\textit{adhikara\u1e47as} or 'cases for discussion' in their system.\\(^5\\)\n\n[87] So approaching, wearing the sacred thread, he uttered his good wishes.\n\nThen on the north not far from the royal palace the attendant on the elephant chanted this sweet couplet in the \\textit{aparavaktra} metre;\n\n\"O young elephant, dismiss thy playful restlessness, follow the rules of good behaviour, with bent head; the heavy hook, crooked like a lion's claws, held aloft, does not spare thee\\(^6\\).\"\n\nBut when the king heard it and saw him, he asked, filling the sky with his voice deep like the roar of a lion in a\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) I.e. the 64 kal\u0101s.\n\n\\(^2\\) This is a double-meaning of the phrase \\textit{yoga-pattaka\u1e45k\u0101}; and so in the other sentences.\n\n\\(^3\\) Lit.

The nature and talk of people will always be wilful and various; but the great ought to see things as they are. You surely will not regard me with prejudice as if I had no special claims. I am a Br\u0101hma\u1e47a born in the family of the Soma-drinking V\u0101tsy\u0101yanas. Every ceremony was duly performed, as its time came, beginning with the investiture with the sacred cord; [88] I have thoroughly studied the Veda with its six \u0101\u1e45gas, and as far as I was able I have heard lectures on the \u0101\u015btras, and from my marriage I have been a diligent householder; what signs have I of being a petit-maitre? My youth indeed was not without those follies which are not directly inconsistent with either world,\u2014so far I will not deny; and my heart on this point will confess a feeling of repentance. But now-a-days, when your highness,\u2014calm in mind like Buddha himself, one who carries out all the rules for the castes and orders like Manu, and bears the rod of punishment as visibly as Yama,\u2014governs the whole earth girdled by the seven oceans, and bearing all the continents as its garland,\u2014who would venture without fear even to act in his own mind the character of indecorum, that bosom-friend of open profligacy? I will not dwell on human beings,\u2014in consequence of your power even the bees drink honey in fear, even the ruddy-geese are\n\n1 Or 'K\u0101ma is a petit-maitre, not I.'\n2 Madhu means 'wine' as well as 'honey.'\nashamed of their too great fondness,\u2014the very monkeys are alarmed when they play their wanton tricks, and even all the destructive animals eat flesh with compassion. Your highness will in time know me thoroughly by yourself, for it is the nature of the wise that their minds never act perversely.\" Having said this, he was silent.\n\nThe king also, after simply saying, \"So we have heard,\" was silent; but he did not welcome him with any signs of favour such as friendly conversation, inviting him to sit down, etc.; he only revealed his inward pleasure by a gracious glance which seemed to bedew him with a shower of ambrosia; and as the setting sun was verging to the west, [89] he dismissed his courtiers and entered his private apartments. B\u0101\u1e47a also went out and retired to his place of abode. The day was now calm and its fierce blaze soft like polished brass, and the sun\u00b9, the diadem of the western mountain's crest, as he left the sky, was letting fall his rays like the sprays of the Nicula tree\u00b2; the deserted cow-stations in the forests had their patches of tender grass covered with families of deer lazily ruminating; the river-banks resounded plaintively with the cooing of the melancholy female ruddy-geese; in the pleasure-groves near the house all the waterpots were being turned over to fill the basins near the trees, while the troops of chattering sparrows were sitting on the boughs which formed their home; the companies of hungry calves were drinking their mothers' flowing udders, after they had returned from wandering during the day; the sun's round goblet for drinking the evening libation of the western ocean was sinking covered with a red glow as if it were plunged into a stream of mineral veins in the western mountain; the religious mendicants were intent on worshipping the shrines, having washed their feet and hands in the outpour of their water-pots; the fire, with the sacred grass spread round it, was blazing up, with its hands purified by the sacrificial vessels; the devout sacrificers were duly offering their libations; the trees of the groves stood with their monkeys resting from all their tricks,\n\n\u00b9 Read in the Bombay ed. mar\u012bcimati.\n\u00b2 A tree with scarlet myrtle-like flowers in long pendent racemes.\nand with the nests of the crows crowded with their inmates fast asleep; the owls, settled in their huts in the hollow trunks of old trees, were preparing to go out on an expedition; a thicker host of stars was indenting the expanse of the sky, like a quantity of water-drops scattered at the time of the evening worship by the thousand hands of the sages; the crest of night floated over the sky like a mountaineer-woman's topknot; the young avatar of evening, dark like \u00c7iva's neck, was devouring all that remained of the daylight; the lines of the lamps shone out as if they were the ray-fingers of the sun which had entered into the earthly fire at night and had come forth to point in scorn at the darkness; the gates seemed to announce their closure by the creaking of the folding leaves; [90] the children were beginning to long to go to sleep, having enjoyed a good lying in bed while listening to the long stories of the old nurse; the dreadful mouth of early night was beginning to yawn, with its darkness as black as ink or an old buffalo, and waking up 'the good people.' K\u0101ma with his twanging bow-string was raining a continual succession of arrows and stealing the intellect of all the world, the ladies had their loins jingling with the girdles of many woven threads tied by their tire-women, while romantic heroines started on their wanderings in the empty roads, following the guidance of love; the pleasant chatter of the geese in the ponds became rare, as it was dulled by the tinkling of the anklets of the women, and the notes of the cranes, as these grew longer as they became deeper asleep, melted the hearts of separated lovers; and a number of lamps were scattered about like the seeds beginning to shoot of the coming day.\n\nHe reflected to himself, \"King Har\u1e63a is very gracious, since he is still fond of me, though he is vexed at the rumours which have naturally spread about my many youth-\n\n1 The Comm. explains vidr\u0101\u1e47a as alasa, cf. p. 90, l. 9, 230, 13, and 235, 16.\n2 Taitt.

He wishes me to be virtuous; for lords teach proper behaviour to their dependents even without words by granting them an appropriate reception. Shame on me, thus blinded in my mind by my own faults, and crushed by neglect,\u2014that I venture to indulge in various fancies concerning this most excellent monarch. Verily I will endeavour so to act that he may recognise me in time in my real character.\"\n\nHaving made this resolve, he went out the next day from the royal camp and remained for a while in the houses of his friends and relations, until the king of himself learned his true character and became favourably inclined to him. Then he reentered again to visit the royal abode; [91] and in the course of a very few days he was received by his gracious majesty into the highest degree of honour springing from kindness, of affection, and of confidence, and shared with him in his wealth, his hours of unbending, and his state dignity.\n\nHere ends the second chapter\u2014entitled The Visit to the King\u2014of the Har\u1e63a-Carita composed by \u00c7r\u012b B\u0101na Bha\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101.\nCHAPTER III.\n\nRaining affection on their country\u00b9, thronged by many devoted people\u00b2,\nEven as fine seasons are kings born through the merits of their subjects.\nTo serve the good, to behold the goddess of glory, to tread the heavens,\nWhose heart is not eager?\u2014aye and to hear the fortunes of heroes.\n\nOn a certain occasion B\u0101\u1e47a left the king's presence and went to that Br\u0101hma\u1e47 settlement to revisit his kin. It was the beginning of autumn, when the clouds are thinned, when the cataka is distressed, when the k\u0101damba duck gives voice,\u2014the season deadly to frogs, robbing the peacock of its pride. Then the caravans of hamsas are welcomed back\u00b3, the sky is like a whetted sword, the sun brilliant, the moon at her clearest, tender the array of stars. The rainbow of Indra fades, the girdling lightning is at rest, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u's sleep is invaded\u2074; the waters run hued like lapis lazuli, the clouds rolling light as mists leave Indra unemployed. Then closes the N\u012bpa, the Ku\u1e6daja has no flower; budless is the plantain,\n\n\u00b9 Or of the seasons\u2014'bringing moisture by their rain.'\n\u00b2 Or 'with people rich in rice.'\n\u00b3 The wild geese fly to the hills when the inundations cover the plains at the beginning of the rainy season, and they return in the autumn.\n\u2074 Cf. Wilson, 'Hindu Theatre,' ii. 197.\nsoft the red lotus, the blue lotus exudes honey; the water-lily is a joy, the nights are cool with the \u00c7eph\u0101lik\u0101, the jasmine [93] becomes fragrant; the ten regions are all ablaze with opening night lotuses, grey are the winds with Saptacchada pollen, lovely clustering Bandh\u016bkas form an unexpected evening glow. The horses have undergone lustration, the elephants are wild, the herds of oxen intoxicated with ferocity. The range of mud diminishes, young sand isles bud forth by the river banks. The wild rice is parched to ripeness, the pollen is formed in the Priya\u1e45gu blossoms, the cucumber's skin is hardened, and the reed grass\u00b9 smiles with flowers.\n\nGratified beyond measure at the news of B\u0101\u1e47a's favour with the king, his kinsmen came forth to meet him with congratulations. In due course he experienced the great joy of finding himself among his numerous relatives, greeting some, greeted by others, kissed by some, kissing others, embraced by some, embracing others, welcomed with a blessing by some, blessing others. The elders being seated, he took a seat brought by his excited attendants. At the receipt of the flower offering and other hospitable attentions his delight was still further increased, and it was with a joyous heart that he made his inquiries:\u2014\"Have you been happy all this time? Does the sacrifice proceed without hindrance, gratifying the Br\u0101hma\u1e47 groups by its faultless performance? Do the fires devour oblations with ritual duly and without flaw performed? Do the boys pursue their studies at the proper time? Is there the same unbroken daily application to the Veda? The old earnestness in the practice of the art of sacrifice? Are there the same classes in grammar exposition, showing respect by days not idly spent in a series of emulous discussions? Is there the old logic society, [94] regardless of all other occupations? The same excessive delight in the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e41s\u0101, dulling all pleasure in other authoritative books? Are there the same poetic addresses, raining down an ambrosia of ever-new phrases?\"\n\n\u00b9 Cf. Wilson, 'Hindu Theatre,' ii. 196 n.\nThey replied:\u2014\u201cSon, the affairs of us people devoted to contentment, whose intellectual pastimes are always at command, and whose only companion is the sacrificial fire, are of little importance, so long as the earth is happily protected by our monarch\u2019s arm, swaying the whole world and long as the body of the king of serpents. We are in any case happy, but especially now that you, having cast aside indolence, occupy a cane seat beside our sovereign lord. All the ceremonies proper to Br\u0101hmans are fully carried out as far as our powers and means permit and in due season.\u201d\n\nMid such conversations as these, court news, remembrances of past boyish sports, and stories of the men of old he amused himself with them for some time; at length rising at noon, he complied with the usual observances. After dinner his kinsmen gathered round him. Soon the reader Sudri\u1e63\u1e6di was observed approaching, wearing a pair of silken Pa\u1e47\u1e0dra cloths pale as the outer corner of the peacock\u2019s eye: his sectarian lines were painted in gorocan\u0101 and clay from a sacred pool blessed at the end of his bath; his hair was made sleek with oil and myrobolan, a thick bunch of flowers, kissing his short topknot, added a touch of spruceness, the glow of his lips had been heightened by several applications of betel, and a brilliance imparted to his eyes by the use of a stick of collyrium: he had just dined [95] and his dress was decorous and respectable. He seated himself on a chair not far away, and, after waiting a moment, set down in front of him a desk made of reed stalks, and laid upon it a manuscript from which he had removed the tie, but which still seemed encircled by the rays of his nails like soft lotus fibres. Next he assigned a place to a bee and a dove, which he set down close behind him.

By Saud\u0101sa the earth was not protected, but confounded\u00b2. Nala, unable to control his passion for diceing\u00b3, [99] was overcome by Kali. Samvara\u1e47a had a weakness for Mitra's daughter\u2074. Da\u00e7aratha came by his death through overfondness for his beloved R\u0101ma\u2075. K\u0101rtav\u012brya was slain\u2076 for persecuting cows and Br\u0101hmans. Marutta, though he performed the Bahusuvar\u1e47a sacrifice, involving vast expenditure, was not highly honoured by gods and Br\u0101hmans\u2077. \u00c7antanu, separated through infatuation from his (loved) river\u2078, wept all alone in the forest.

Thus no reign has been stainless except that of this Har\u1e63a, king of kings, sovereign of all continents. Concerning him indeed many marvels are reported:\u2014In him we see\u00b9\u00b9 how a 'Subduer of Hosts' has set at rest the moving partisan kings\u00b9\u00b2.

Drona had said that his pupil Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira would never tell a lie even for the sovereignty of the three worlds.\n\u00b9\u00b9 He proceeds to shew by a series of plays on words how Har\u1e63a fulfils the feats of mythological heroes.\n\u00b9\u00b2 Or 'a Balajit (Indra) has fixed fast the winged mountains.'\na 'Lord of People' has displayed forbearance towards all other rulers\\(^1\\). In him a 'Best of Men' has won fame by pounding a king of Sindh\\(^2\\). In him a 'Man of Might' has loosened a king\\(^3\\) from a circling trunk and abandoned an elephant\\(^4\\). In him a 'Lord' has anointed a young prince\\(^5\\).\n\n[101] In him a 'Master' has signalized his power by laying low his enemy\\(^6\\) at one stroke. In him a 'Man-lion' has manifested his might by cutting down his enemy with his own hand\\(^7\\). In him a 'Supreme Lord' has taken tribute from an inaccessible land of snowy mountains\\(^8\\). In him a 'World's Lord' has stationed the world's guardians at the entrance to the regions, and the treasure of all the earth has been distributed among the first of the people\\(^9\\). These and the like great undertakings do we see, resembling those of the first age of gold. Therefore we are eager to hear from the beginning onwards in the order of his lineage the fortunes of this auspiciously named hero, rich in the merit won by noble deeds. It is long since we first desired to hear. As the magnet attracts hard and sapless iron, so do the qualities of the great even the hard and tasteless minds of insignificant people: much more those of others naturally tasteful and susceptible. Who could be without curiosity regarding his story, a second Mah\u0101-Bh\u0101rata? Pray relate it, your highness!

Har\u1e63a rescued him when encircled in the trunk of a mad elephant, which he then let loose in the woods. The words may also mean 'a Bali has set free the encircled mountain and loosened a great serpent (= V\u0101suki).'\n\n\\(^4\\) The great elephant's name was Darpa\u1e47\u0101\u1e6da.\n\n\\(^5\\) Ref. to the god of war, Kum\u0101ra, and to Har\u1e63a's young son.\n\n\\(^6\\) There is a pun on Ar\u0101ti, 'king of the demons,' slain by Kum\u0101ra.\n\n\\(^7\\) There is an involved ref. to the story of the Dwarf Avatar of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u.\n\n\\(^8\\) There is a punning ref. to \u010civa's taking Durg\u0101 to wife.\n\n\\(^9\\) I.e. the Br\u0101hmans.

So much said he became silent.\n\n\"Sir,\" replied B\u0101\u1e47a with a smile, \"your remarks accord not with fitness. I consider the demands of your curiosity impracticable. People absorbed in their own objects are commonly void of discrimination between the possible and impossible. Attracted by the virtues of others and confused, I suppose, by passion for hearing stories of friends, the minds even of the great lose their discernment. Consider, sir! On the one hand you have a mere student's wit of an atom's capacity, on the other his majesty's story [102] commensurate with the whole edifice of Brahma; on the one hand a few sounds with circumscribed letters and the five modes of word-formation, on the other virtues beyond calculation. Beyond the comprehension of the omniscient, beyond the capacity of the god of speech, beyond the strength of the goddess of eloquence, how much more is he beyond such as I! What man could possibly even in a hundred of men's lives depict his story in full? If, however, you care for a part, I am ready. In what way may a feeble tongue possessed of a few grains of letters be of service? Your highnesses are the audience, the fortunes of Har\u1e63a the theme: what more can be said? The day, however, is near its close. The adorable sun, bright with matted locks of ruddy rays trailing behind, is sinking in the mass of the evening glow, like the Bh\u1e5bigu R\u0101ma in the great pool of all Kuruk\u1e63etra's blood. To-morrow I will narrate the story.\" \"So be it,\" they all assented, and rising soon after, he proceeded to the \u00c7ona for his twilight worship.\n\nThen, with heat soft as a M\u0101lwa woman's wine-flushed cheek, the day folded itself up. Red exceedingly, as if through toying with the lotus beds, the sun kissing the dusk declined: following the track of whose chariot horses, the\n\n---\n\n1 Or\u2014reading r\u0101jar\u1e63ivam\u00e7acarita\u00e7ravanena\u2014'hearing of the fortunes of this royal sage's house.'\n2 I.e. the world.\n3 Samantapa\u00f1caka\u2014'the whole land of the five lakes,'\u2014alluding to Para\u00e7u-R\u0101ma's slaughter of the K\u1e63atriyas.\ndarkness sped like Yama's buffalo along the firmament. In due course the bark dresses hanging upon the hut-roofs of the house ascetics were gathered in along with their patches of red blaze. The heavens were gladdened by the smoke of the Agnihotra rite, stealing away the taint of the Kali age. The sacrificers preserved a rigid silence: the women strolled around in the restlessness of recreation time. Bundles of green panicum and rice were being strewn about for the sacrificial cows after milking; the V\u0101t\u0101na fires were being lighted, the braided ascetics, hairy with black antelope skins, were seated on their clean mats, [103] the students mumbled their tasks, the meditating yogis squatted in the Brahma posture, innumerable scholars ran about with sounds of clapping, while, by leave of their wearied old teacher, a concourse of dolts, dandies, and boys performed their twilight task by blunderingly belching out the disconnected lines of their books.\n\nAs the evening was now established in the sky and the lamps called stars were peeping forth, B\u0101\u1e47a proceeded to the house, and sate down in the same company with his loved kinsmen. The first watch having been so spent, he betook himself to a bed in the house of Ga\u1e47apati. With all the others, however, who in spite of closed eyes obtained no sleep, waiting like lotus beds for the sunrise, curiosity made the night wear but heavily away.\n\nAwaking at the fourth watch of the night, the same bard as before sang a couple of verses:\n\n'Stretching out his foot behind, elongating his body upwards to full length by bending his spine,\n'With bowed neck leaning his mouth upon his breast, tossing his dust-grey mane,\n'His projecting nostrils restlessly moving through desire for fodder, the steed,\n'Now risen from his bed, gently whinnying paws the earth with his hoof.\n'With bent back and loins brought near his mouth, curving his neck sideways,\n'His curls matted about his ears, the horse with his hoof rubs the corner of his eye,\n\n1 Cf. \u00c7akuntala 32. 2 Should we read sa\u1e43dhy\u0101\u1e43sam?\n'Inflamed by irritation in sleep, while small bits of chaff cling to his moving eyelashes,\n'And his eye is uneasily smitten\\(^1\\) by his tossing hoar-frost-scattering forehead-tuft.'\n\n[104] Hearing this, B\u0101\u1e47a dispelled his slumbers, and having arisen, washed his face, worshipped the holy twilight, took his betel at sunrise, and sought the same place as before. Meanwhile all his kinsmen collected and sat down in a circle round him. Having learnt their object through the former discussion, he began to relate to them the fortunes of Harsha:\n\n\"Listen. There is a certain region named \u010crikantha, peopled by the good, a heaven of Indra, as it were, descended upon earth, where the laws of caste usage are for ever unconfused and the order of the K\u1e5bita age prevails. Owing to the number of its land lotuses the ploughs, whose shares uproot the fibres as they scar the acres, excite a tumult of bees, singing, as it were, the excellencies of the good soil. Unbroken lines of Pundra sugar-cane enclosures seem besprinkled by the clouds that drink the Milky Sea\\(^2\\). On every side its marches are packed with corn heaps, like extemporized mountains, distributed among the threshing floors\\(^3\\). Throughout it is adorned with rice crops extending beyond their fields, where the ground bristles with cumin beds watered by the pots of the Persian wheel. Upon its lordly uplands are wheat crops variegated with R\u0101jam\u0101\u1e63a patches ripe to bursting and yellow with the split bean pods. Attended by singing herdsmen mounted on buffalos, pursued by sparrows greedy for swarms of flies, gay with the tinkle of bells bound to their necks, roaming herds of cows make white its forests, revelling on V\u0101spachedya\\(^4\\) grass and dropping milk as if the Milky Sea had been drunk by the bull of \u010civa\n\n---\n\n1 Should we read \u0101hanayam\u0101n\u0101m?\n2 By reason of their sweetness, Comm.\n3 But v.

Like eyes let fall by Indra\\(^1\\) when blinded by the smoke of its divers burnt sacrifices, thousands of spotted antelopes dot the districts. [105] Regions, pale with the dust of Ketaki beds emitting white pollen, gleam like the approaches of \u00c7iva\u2019s City when made grey by the sprinklings of the Pramathas. Pot-herbs and plantains blacken the soil around the villages. At every step are groups of young camels. The exits are made attractive by vine-arbours and pomegranate orchards; arbours, ablaze with P\u012blu sprays, besmeared with the juice of hand-pressed citron leaves, having flower bunches formed of spontaneously gathered saffron filaments, and travellers blissfully sleeping after drinking the juice of fresh fruit, very hostels, as it were, with wood-nymphs dispensing ambrosia: orchards, where the fruit, ripe to bursting, seems coloured by the beaks of the parrots attacking the seeds, and the flowers are tinged by the cheeks of climbing monkey tribes. There are lovely groves where woodrangers taste the cocoa-nut juice, where travelling folk plunder the date-trees, monkeys lick sweet-scented date juice, and partridges tear the \u0100ruka to pieces with their beaks. Not barren are the sylvan hollows of forest pools, refuge of myriad travellers, encircled with avenues of tall Arjuna trees and turbid at the edges through the descent of herds of kine. Troops of camels and flocks of sheep form in hordes under the guardianship of camel boys. Wandering droves of mares, besmeared with the sap of crushed saffron beds, where they roll as if to seduce the steeds of the sun\u2019s chariot, visit the land, roaming like the deer of the Maruts\\(^2\\) at will, with snorting nostrils and uplifted heads drinking in the air, as it were to beget speed in the young lying in their wombs.\n\nSeen like wild geese amid the dusk of ever-smoking sacrifices, the reeds are white upon the earth.

Graced is it with ponds like Vi\u1e63\u1e47u's navel, where fine birds\u00b2 are seated upon lotuses with tall stalks. Its regions are filled with wide ranches\u00b3, which, like the turmoil of the churning of the Milky Ocean, wash the lands with torrents of churned milk. Such is the land of \u0106rikan\u1e6dha.\n\nThere did false doctrines fade away, as if washed out by a rain of tears due to the smoke of the Triple Fire. Sinful ways vanished, as if consumed by the burning of the bricks for altars. Demerit was scotched, as if cleft by the axes which fashioned sacrificial posts. Caste confusion ceased, as if cleansed by a rain from the smoke clouds of oblation fires. Sin fled, as if gored by the horns of the many thousands of presented oxen. Disasters were cut away, as if excised by numerous axes chiselling stone for temples. Calamities sped afar, as if routed by the tumult of munificent rites. Disease was dissipated, as if consumed by myriad blazing sacrificial kitchens. Sudden death came not near, as if alarmed by the sharp beat of holy drums struck at bulls' wedlocks\u2074. [107] Plagues departed, as if deafened by the never-ceasing noise of hymns. Overwhelmed, as it were, by the rule of law, mishap did not arise.\n\nIn such a country is a certain district called Sth\u0101\u1e47vi\u00e7vara, blessed, like the world's first youth, with sweet fragrance of lovely flowers in divers pleasances; bedecked, like the road\n\n\u00b9 The Sanskrit has a play on the double sense of v\u1e5bttam=(1) conduct, (2) round and of gunin=(1) worthy, (2) strung on a cord.\n\u00b2 Dvijottama=(1) best of birds, (2) Brahm\u0101, (3) Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, there being an allusion to the story that Brahm\u0101 reclines on a lotus springing from Vi\u1e63\u1e47u's navel.\n\u00b3 Beside 'wide ranches' mah\u0101gho\u1e63a may denote 'mighty rumblings.'\n\u2074 For the letting loose of bulls cf.

The images of their curls in the convex of their cheeks are ear-pendants that give no trouble; Tam\u0101la shoots are a superfluity. The talk of their dear ones forms happy ear-ornaments; rings and the like are but affectation. Their cheeks alone give a perpetual sunshine; for pomp only have they jewelled lamps by night. Tribes of bees attracted by their breath are their beauteous veils, the duty of noble women their hair-nets. Their voices alone are their sweet lutes, harp-playing is but an irrelevant accomplishment. Laughs are their exceeding fragrant perfumes; needless is camphor powder. The gleam of their lips is a more brilliant cosmetic; saffron unguent is a worthless blot upon their loveliness. Their arms are the softest of playfully smiting wands; purposeless are lotus stalks. Drops of the sweat of youthful warmth are their artful bosom ornaments, necklaces but a burden. Their laps are broad squares of crystal slabs for their lovers; jewelled couches in their mansions a needless means of repose. Bees clinging in greed for such lotuses are their resonant foot-ornaments; useless are anklets of sapphire. Domestic kalaha\u1e43sas, summoned by the tinkle of their anklets, are the unfailing companions of their walks; attendants are but the accidents of greatness.\n\nIn that country there arose a monarch named Pu\u1e63pabh\u016bti,\n\n---\n\n1 Or \u2018with faces pure as Br\u0101hmans, yet &c.\u2019, wine-drinking being forbidden to Br\u0101hmans.\n2 Or\u2014punningly\u2014\u2018libidinous.\u2019\n3 Or\u2014punningly\u2014\u2018far-famed as wives (Or \u2018having brilliant reti-\nnues\u2019), yet reckoned among the poor.\u2019\n4 Or\u2014punningly\u2014\u2018tart in speech.\u2019\n5 Or\u2014punningly\u2014\u2018they are flushed with wine.\u2019\n6 Or\u2014punningly\u2014\u2018the marriage thread.\u2019\nhaving, like Indra incarnate, a bow supporting all castes\\(^1\\), Meru-like in the attribute of a golden nature, Mandara-like in attracting glory\\(^2\\), ocean-like in observing proper bounds\\(^3\\), ether-like in the noising abroad of his fame\\(^4\\), moon-like in his receptivity for arts\\(^5\\), Veda-like in truthful\\(^6\\) speech, earth-like in [110] supporting all mankind, wind-like in sweeping away the bad passions of all kings\\(^7\\), a Guru in speech, a Pr\u012bthu in breast, a Vi\u00e7\u0101la\\(^8\\) in intellect, a Janaka in asceticism, a Suy\u0101tra in splendour, a Sumantra in secret council, a Bhudha in station, an Arjuna in brilliance, a Bh\u012b\u1e63ma with the bow, a Ni\u1e63adha in frame, a \u00c7atrughna in battle, a \u00c7\u016bra in vanquishing armies of heroes\\(^9\\), a Dak\u1e63a in fecundity; framed in fine as it seemed of the compounded splendour of all the pramaeal kings.\n\nThis king, jealous of the saying \u201cthis earth was made a cow by Pr\u012bthu,\u201d made the earth his queen\\(^10\\). Now the minds of the great are naturally wilful and follow their own lights. Wherefore from boyhood upwards he, untaught by any man, entertained a great, almost inborn, devotion towards \u00c7iva the adorable, readily won by faith, upholder of the universe, creator of creatures, annihilator of existence. From all other gods he turned away. Not even in dreams did he take food without worshipping him whose emblem is the bull. Devoted to the Lord of Beings, the increate, ageless, guru of the immortals, the foe of the Demons\u2019 City, the lord of countless Hosts, spouse of the Daughter of the Mountains, him before whose feet all worlds bow, he thought the three spheres void of all other deities. The dispositions of his subjects also were conformable to their monarch\u2019s mind.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Or \u2018of all colours.\u2019\n\n\\(^2\\) Or \u2018Lak\u1e63m\u012b.\u2019\n\n\\(^3\\) Or \u2018rectitude.\u2019\n\n\\(^4\\) Or \u2018manifesting sound,\u2019 which is the property of \u0101k\u0101\u1e47a.\n\n\\(^5\\) Or \u2018assemblage of digits.\u2019\n\n\\(^6\\) Or \u2018increate.\u2019\n\n\\(^7\\) Or \u2018all earthly dust.\u2019\n\n\\(^8\\) The name of a Bodhisattva, Comm.\n\n\\(^9\\) Or perhaps \u2018in conquering \u00c7\u016brasena.\u2019\n\n\\(^10\\) Mahi\u1e63\u012b may also mean \u2018a buffalo-cow.\u2019\nThus:\u2014house by house the holy lord of the Cleaving Axe was worshipped: the winds blowing in those pure districts were fragrant with much resin melted in the sacrificial pits, they dropped a rain of dew from the milk used for bathing\u00b9, they whirled along petals of Bel twig chaplets. [111] It was with gifts and presents customary in \u00c7iva\u2019s worship that the king was honoured by citizens, dependants, councillors, and neighbouring sovereigns, whom his arm\u2019s might had conquered and made tributary. Thus:\u2014they gratified his heart with huge \u00c7iva bulls\u00b2 white as Kail\u0101sa\u2019s peaks, and ringed about their horn-tips with gold-leaf creepers; with golden ewers, with oblation vessels, censers, flowered cloths, lamps on jewelled stands, Br\u0101hmanical threads, and mukhako\u00e7as\u00b3 inlaid with bits of precious gems. His queens also complied with his desire, voluntarily undertaking the threshing of the scattered rice, deepening the glow of their hands by staining the temples with unguents, occupying all their attendants in stringing flowers. Now this monarch so devoted to \u00c7iva heard men speak of a certain great \u00c7aiva saint named Bhairav\u0101c\u0101rya, almost a second overthrower of Dak\u1e63a\u2019s sacrifice\u2074, who belonged to the Deckan, but whose powers, made famous by his excellence in multifarious sciences, were, like his many thousands of disciples, spread abroad over the whole sphere of humanity. Harmony in character conciliates good will even towards unknown persons; and so, immediately on hearing of this saint Bhairav\u0101c\u0101rya, the king conceived towards him, though far away, a deep affection as towards a second \u00c7iva, and desired even with longing by all means to see his face.\n\nOne day, as the failing light was kissing the western hill, the portress approached the king, who was in the harem, and said: \u2018Your majesty, a recluse stands at the door and declares that he has come by order of Bhairav\u0101c\u0101rya.\u2019\n\n\u00b9 I.e. bathing the god\u2019s image.\n\u00b2 I.e. bulls let loose in honour of \u00c7iva.\n\u00b3 It is difficult to see what this word means: the Comm. says mukhayukt\u0101\u1e25 ko\u1e6d\u0101 mukhako\u1e6d\u0101 ye li\u1e45gopari d\u012byante. Perhaps it is a covering for wrapping the image of the li\u1e45ga.\n\u2074 The real overthrower of Dak\u1e63a\u2019s sacrifice was \u00c7iva himself.\n'Where is he,' the king with profound respect inquired, 'conduct him here, introduce him.' The chamberlain did so, and soon the king saw the ascetic enter, a tall fellow [112] with arms extending to his knees, emaciated by a mendicant's life yet from the stoutness of the bones in his limbs appearing fat, broad in the head, his forehead undulating with deep wrinkles, fleshless hollows beneath his eyes, which were round and ruddy as wine drops, his nose slightly curved, one ear very pendulous, the rows of his prominent teeth distinct as seeds in a gourd, his lip loose as a horse's, his jaw elongated by a hanging chin. A red ascetic's scarf hanging from his shoulder formed his vaikak\u1e63aka wrap; his upper robe, consisting of a tattered rag knotted above his heart and stained with red chalk, seemed to betoken the knotted passions of his heart, which he had rent in pieces\u00b9. In one hand he grasped his bamboo stool. His left held a yoke pole resting on his shoulder, where its motionless point of support was tied with a complicated fastening of hair rope; to this were attached his dirt-scraper and sieve of bamboo bark, his loin cloth at the end, his alms bowl contained in its receptacle, namely a cavity of Kharj\u016bra wood, his waterpot fixed in a triangular support made of three sticks, his slippers disposed outside, and a bundle of manuscript bound by a string of stout cord.\n\nAs he drew near, the king welcomed him with the usual courtesies, and when he was seated, asked where Bhairav\u0101c\u0101rya was. Charmed with the king's gracious speech, the mendicant stated that he was staying near the city in a deserted house contiguous with the woods on the Sarasvat\u012b's banks; and he further added 'His reverence honours your sovereign majesty with his blessing.' With which words he drew from his pack and presented five jewelled silver lotuses sent by Bhairav\u0101c\u0101rya, which overlaid the harem with a glow of light.\n\n[113] The king, shrinking, as politeness dictated, from slighting a friend's gift, but also unwilling to be guilty of too hasty acceptance, paused a moment wavering, but at length,\n\n\u00b9 We have here a pun on r\u0101ga\u2014'mortal passion' and also 'red colour.'\nyielding to his great nobleness, he took the gifts and said:\u2014\n\u2018Our devotion to \u00c7iva, the source of all fruitful results,\nproduces fruits inaccessible indeed to desire, seeing that we\nfind such favour with his reverence, the guru of the world.\nTo-morrow I will see his reverence.\u2019 With these words he\ndismissed the ascetic, profoundly delighted at his news.\n\nThe next day he rose early, mounted his horse, and with\nhis white umbrella held above him, and a pair of white\nchowries waving, proceeded accompanied by only a few\nnobles to see Bhairav\u0101c\u0101rya, like the moon visiting the sun.\nHaving advanced some distance, he saw one of Bhairav\u0101c\u0101rya\u2019s\nown disciples approaching, and inquired where his reverence\nwas staying. \u2018In a Bel-tree plantation,\u2019 the man replied,\n\u2018north of yon old temple to the Mothers.\u2019 So he proceeded\nto the place, dismounted, and entered the plantation.\n\nIn the midst of a great throng of recluses [116] he beheld\nBhairav\u0101c\u0101rya\u00b9, who on seeing him at a distance moved like\nthe ocean seeing the moon, and, after his disciples had first\nrisen, rose and went forward to meet the king. Having\npresented a gift of Bel fruit, he pronounced a benediction in\ntones deep as the roar of Ganges\u2019 flood when it was vomited\nforth from Jahnu\u2019s ear.\n\nThe king, whose eyes, expanding their white in pleasure,\nseemed to repay the lotuses many-fold, and whose brilliant\ncrest-jewel, declining upon his forehead, seemed to put forth\na third eye as a manifestation of \u00c7iva\u2019s favour\u00b2, repeated his\nsalutation by a bow from a distance; while from his ear-\nwreath, as he bent down, bees flew away like departing sins\nall uprooted by \u00c7iva worship. \u2018Approach, be seated here,\u2019 said\nthe teacher, pointing to his own tiger-skin. \u2018Your reverence,\u2019\nthe king respectfully replied in a voice flowing like a river of\nhoney and rich with the passionate throbbing utterance of\nlovesick hamsas, \u2018you ought not to make me suffer for the\nfaults of other princes. It is surely the bad manners of that\ninglorious glory which all kings regard, or else the mean\npride of wealth, which makes the teacher deal so with me.\n\n\u00b9 For the description of Bhairav\u0101c\u0101rya v. Appendix.\n\u00b2 \u00c7iva himself has a third eye in his forehead.\nI am no object for ceremoniousness. Enough of formality: however far removed, in will I am your reverence's disciple. A teacher's seat should be like himself respected, not desecrated. Let your highness only sit here.' So much said, he seated himself on a rug brought by his attendants. Bhairav\u0101c\u0101rya likewise, complying graciously with the king's not to be resisted words, reoccupied as before his tiger skin. All being seated, the nobles and retinue and also the students, he made the customary offering of flowers and the like. In due course captivated by the king's charm of manner, [117] he began to speak, displaying teeth glittering like devotion to \u00c7iva made visible, and stainless as a piece of moonlight:\u2014'My son, your exceeding condescension of itself proclaims the majesty of your virtues. You are a vessel for universal good-fortune. Your undertakings harmonize with your greatness. I from birth upwards have never had regard to riches. This poor person of mine therefore is not sold to wealth, that fuel to the fire of the whole round of vice. My life is sustained by alms. A few hard-won syllables of knowledge are mine. I have some small store of merit acquired by humble service of the holy Master \u00c7iva. Be pleased to appropriate whatever of this deserves to be of service. Like flowers, the minds of the good can be bound by very slight ties\u00b9. Moreover good men approved by the wise, like good words, at the first hearing produce a flash even in profound minds. I was being borne away on the foam-white currents, as it were, of a curiosity plunging into hidden depths\u00b2, when your nobility drew me back by its array of virtues\u00b3.'\n\n'Your reverence,' replied the king, 'let the bodies of the good be ever so devoted, their owners alone can be our friends\u2074. The mere sight of you has done me infinite good. By his mere coming the teacher has placed me in an enviable position.' After some time spent in these and various discourses he went home.\n\n\u00b9 Or 'virtues.'\n\u00b2 I.e. 'of knowledge': the metaphor is from a river vanishing underground.\n\u00b3 Or 'cords.'\n\u2074 I.e. I do not need your services, but yourself.\nAnother day Bhairav\u0101c\u0101rya on his part went to see the king, who placed himself, his harem, his court, and his treasury at the ascetic's disposal. But the sage with a smile replied:\u2014'What have we children of the woods to do, your majesty, with power? Wisdom withers sure enough, like a creeper, under the blaze of wealth. The brightness which shines in us is like that of the firefly [118], which scorches no other being. Only your majesty's peers are vessels for fortune.' Then after staying some time he departed.\n\nThe mendicant as before presented five silver lotuses on each occasion. One day however he entered with something wrapt in white rags, and, having sat down as before, after a pause spoke:\u2014'Most fortunate king, his reverence informs your majesty that he has a Br\u0101hma\u1e47 disciple named P\u0101t\u0101lasv\u0101min, who from the hand of a Brahmar\u0101ksasa\\(^1\\) took a great sword called \u0100\u1e6d\u1e6dah\u0101sa. Pray accept of this, a weapon befitting your majesty's arm.' With these words he removed the covering of rags, and drew forth from the sheath a sword, like the autumn sky converted to a scimitar, K\u0101lindi's stream solidified to rival Vi\u1e63\u1e47u's sword, the K\u0101liya snake in its anger against K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a become a weapon, a bit of the black cloud of doomsday fallen from the heaven foreshadowing a rainfall\\(^2\\) to dissolve the world; resembling the smile of Hate\\(^3\\) displaying a circle of great teeth, or Hari's stout arm with the fist\\(^4\\) tightly clenched; formed as it were of deadly poison capable of taking the lives of all the world; composed of steel heated by the fiery wrath of fate; in its exceeding sharpness humming as with rage at the mere touch of the air; seeming, as its image fell upon the jewelled pavement of the hall, to cleave its very self in twain: jagged in edge with rays, like hairs left upon it after decapitating foes; mincing the day, whose light was cut in pieces by an inlay of radiance flickering like the lightning's frequent flash; a side-glance,\n\n---\n\n1 Manu xii. 60.\n2 There is a punning reference to the notion of 'sword-edge water.'\n3 Hims\u0101 wife of Adharma.\n4 Mu\u1e63\u1e6di may also mean 'hilt.' There is also a reference to a demon of that name.\nas it were, of the night of doom, death's ear-lotus, the triumphal shout [119] of pitilessness, the ornament of arrogance, the family friend of wrath, the body of pride, the comrade of valour, the child of death, the path of approaching glory, the road of departing fame.\n\nThe king took it in his hand, and gazing at it for a while, seemed, as it reflected his image, to be giving the weapon a loving embrace\\(^1\\). At length he gave his message:\u2014\n\n'Inform his reverence that, though too practised in the art of scorning the acceptance of other people's property, my mind is unable in his case to commit the impropriety of going counter to his words.' Pleased at the acceptance, the mendicant answered, 'Fortune attend your majesty: I now take leave of you,' and so departed. The king, naturally of a warlike humour, felt that by aid of that sword the earth lay in the hollow of his hand.\n\nThe days passing, Bhairav\u0101c\u0101rya on one occasion made a secret petition to the king:\u2014'The dispositions of the great, your majesty, are careless of their own interests, versed in serving others. To such as your majesty seeing petitioners is a festival, solicitation is to confer a favour, the acceptance of gifts by others a boon. You are the centre of all men's wishes. Wherefore I now address you:\u2014Listen; by a crore of muttered prayers have I, in garlands, clothes, and unguents all of black as enjoined in the Kalpa, performed in the great cemetery the exordium of the potent rite called Mah\u0101k\u0101lah\u1e5bidaya. Its completion ends with the laying of a goblin. Without companions this is unattainable. You are capable of achieving this. Should you undertake the task, there will be three other assistants: one the friend of my boyhood, T\u012b\u1e6dibha, the mendicant who visits your majesty; the second P\u0101t\u0101lasv\u0101min; the third a Dr\u0101vi\u1e0dian disciple of mine, Karnat\u0101la by name. If you approve, let this arm of yours, long as a sky elephant's trunk, take A\u1e6d\u1e6dah\u0101sa and for one night become the bolt of one quarter of the heavens.'\n\nTo this speech the king, delighted, like one in darkness\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) We might, however, translate \"embracing it with his hand which remained motionless as if painted.\"\nwho sees a light, at the opportunity of conferring a favour, replied:\u2014'I am highly honoured, your reverence; I consider myself favoured by a charge to be shared with your disciples.' Overjoyed at the king's words, Bhairav\u0101c\u0101rya proceeded to make an appointment;\u2014'Your honour, armed with your sword, will find us in the empty house near the great cemetery here at this hour on the approaching fourteenth night of the dark fortnight.'\n\nThe days having passed and the fourteenth having arrived, the king after initiation in the \u0100\u015baiva ritual fasted. The sword A\u1e6d\u1e6dah\u0101sa he perfumed and honoured with scents, frankincense, and wreaths. The day came to a close. A ruddy hue spread over the heaven, as though some one had performed a Bali ceremony with sprinkled blood to ensure the success of the rite. The sun's rays hung down like vampires' tongues greedy for the scattered blood. As though out of attachment to the king he too wished to become a warder of the sky, the sun had occupied the western quarter; like goblins seemed the lengthening shadows of the trees. The encircling darkness started up like hell-haunting fiends to stay the rite. In the firmament the starry clusters gathered close, as if to look upon a horrid act. Thus at the dead of night, in the soundless stillness of a sleeping world, the king, eluding his court and harem, a dagger gleaming in his left hand, A\u1e6d\u1e6dah\u0101sa drawn in his right, cloaked from head to foot in the spreading radiance of his sword like a dark blue silken robe assumed to escape detection, set forth alone from the city, and reached the appointed spot; royal majesty attending unbidden, [121] and success dragged, as it were, by the hair behind in the shape of braids of bees attracted by his fragrance.\n\nThen the three, T\u012b\u1e6dibha, Karnat\u0101la, and P\u0101t\u0101lasv\u0101min, came up and announced themselves, armed like Drona's son, K\u1e5bipa, and K\u1e5bitavarma in the Night Assault, bathed, garlanded, and strangely attired. About their topknots of flowers ranged murmuring bees, which formed as it were a magic hair tie. On their heads they wore turban wraps with large Svastika knots fastened in the centre of their\nforeheads, and resembling huge mystic seals. Their cheeks were lit with the light of dazzling earrings pendant from the cavity of one ear, while their mouths were as it were drinking up the gloom of night in the wish to weaken its roaming goblins. Jewelled rings dangling from the other ear anointed them with sparkling lustre like a spell-charmed gorocan\u0101 pigment. Brandishing sharp swords, wherein their images were reflected, they seemed offering human sacrifices to ensure the success of the rite, while the long-continued flashes of the steel lined the darkness, as if they would cleave the night in three with a view to guarding their several quarters of the horizon. Their bucklers, bearing crescents and scintillating starlike groups of silver globules, might be compared to bits of darkness sheared by the hard sword's edge and forming a second and artificial night. They wore thick new cloths girt with golden chain-belts, and daggers were fastened to their waists.\n\n'Who goes there?' demanded the king of the three. They severally announced their names, and with them at his heels he proceeded [122] to the silent, deep, and awful graveyard, where all was in readiness and pounded resin, flaming in magic lamps, filled the heavens with incense and smoke, as if the night were fleeing away with its gloom half-burned by a scattered mustard charm\u00b9.\n\nIn the centre of a great circle of ashes white as lotus pollen Bhairav\u0101c\u0101rya could be seen, a form all aglow with light, like the autumn sun enveloped in a broad halo or Mandara in the whirlpool of the churned Ocean of Milk. Seated on the breast of a corpse which lay supine anointed with red sandal and arrayed in garlands, clothes and ornaments all of red, himself with a black turban, black unguents, black amulet, and black garments, he had begun a fire rite in the corpse's mouth, where a flame was burning. As he offered some black sesamum seeds, it seemed as though in eagerness to become a Vidy\u0101dhara he were annihilating the atoms of defilement which caused his mortal condition. The gleam of\n\n\u00b9 The luminous smoke is compared to the half-burnt night fleeing away into the sky.\nhis nails falling on the oblation appeared to cleanse the flames of the pollution due to contact with the dead man's mouth, while his smoke-inflamed eye flung as it were an offering of blood upon the devouring blaze. His mouth, showing the tips of white teeth as he slightly opened his lips in his muttering, seemed to display in bodily shape the lines of the syllables of his charms. The lamps near him were imaged in the sweat of his sacrificial exertions, as if he were burning his whole body to ensure success. From his shoulder hung a Br\u0101hmanical thread of many strands, encircling his form, like a multiple Vidy\u0101r\u0101ja charm.\n\nHaving approached, the king saluted, and being welcomed set about his own task. [123] P\u0101t\u0101lasv\u0101min chose Indra's quarter, Karmat\u0101la that of Kuvera, the mendicant that of Pracetas, while the king himself adorned that marked by Tri\u00e7\u0101\u1e45ku's light\u00b9.\n\nThe warders of the regions having taken their stations, Bhairav\u0101c\u0101rya confidently entered the cage composed of their arms, and proceeded with his awful work. The opposing fiends having after fruitless resistance and much uproar been allayed, suddenly at the very instant of midnight the earth was rent open to the north and not far from the magic circle, displaying a fissure like the jaws of the mighty boar of doomsday. Forthwith, like a copper post torn up by the sky elephants, there ascended out of the chasm a spirit dark as a blue lotus, with shoulders thick and square as the Great Boar's, a fiend, as it were, risen from the womb of earth or the demon Bali springing up from the cloven hell. The gleam of a M\u0101lat\u012b wreath amid locks of crisp curled hair, sleek, dark and growing thickly, produced the effect of a sapphire temple crowned with the blaze of a jewelled lamp. A throbbing voice and an eye naturally red suggested one drunk with the vapours of youth. A necklace tossed about his throat. Ever and anon he smeared shoulders comparable to the sky elephants' frontal globe with clay crushed in his clenched hand. Irregularly bespotted with moist sandal\n\n\u00b9 Tri\u00e7\u0101\u1e45ku is suspended in the southern heavens, see R\u0101m\u0101y. i. 60.\npaste, he resembled a tract of autumn sky speckled with bits of very white cloud. Above a petticoat white as the Ketak\u012b petal his flank was drawn tight by a scarf, the long white cotton fringe of which, carelessly left loose, hung to the ground just as if it were the serpent \u00c7e\u1e63a supporting him from behind. His stout thick thighs [124] planted slow paces as if he feared to break through the earth: yet they could scarce support his mountain-like form with its burden of overpowering pride. Again and again he doubled his left arm athwart his breast, raised the right cross-wise, bent his leg, and furiously slapped his arms\\(^1\\) with such a noise as though he would raise a storm to hinder the rite and maim the animate world of one sense. 'Ho, my would-be paramour of Vidy\u0101dhari\u015b,' he sneeringly shouted in tones awful as the echo of Narasimha's roar, 'whence this conceit of knowledge or blind reliance on your helpers, that without making an oblation to me you aspire\u2014fool that you are\u2014to success? What madness is this? Has no mention come to your ears after all this time of me, the N\u0101ga \u00c7rikan\u1e6dha, after whom this region, whereof I am lord, is named? Against my will what power have the very planets to move in the heavens? What a miserable unkingly king is this, who accepts favours from such \u00c7aiva outcasts as you! Receive now along with this wretched monarch the reward of your misconduct.' When he had said thus much, the three, Titibha and the rest, rushed upon him; but with furious buffets he dashed them, armour, swords and all, to the ground.\n\nNever before had the king heard himself reviled. His limbs, albeit unwounded, poured forth a stream of furious sweat, water of the sword-edge, as it were, drunk in many a battle. His hair bristled like an array of arrow heads shot out in hundreds to lighten him for the fray. Even A\u1e6d\u1e6dah\u0101sa, mirroring the constellations, seemed to proclaim his unbending spirit by a contemptuous smile showing clearly a row of white teeth. As his hands moved restlessly in the\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) An Indian challenge to combat.\nact of tightening his girdle, their horizon-like gleam of nails [125] seemed a demon-quelling charm circle, blocking the wide heaven to guard against escape. Scornfully he cried, 'Ho, serpent, crow, are you not ashamed to demand an oblation in the presence of such a royal flamingo as I? But what avail these taunts? Valour dwells in the arm, not in the voice. Take to your weapon. Not thus are you my match. My arm is untaught to smite the weaponless.' With still greater disdain the N\u0101ga replied:\u2014'Approach, what care I for swords? With my two arms will I crush your pride,' and so slapped his arms. Ashamed to vanquish a weaponless foe with weapons, the king, flinging away sword and buckler, girt up his loins outside his cloak for a fight with fists. So they fought till their furious slapping had bedewed them with a rain of blood from lacerated arms, which falling like stone pillars almost converted the whole world into sound. Soon the king smote the serpent to the earth, and having seized him by the hair, had drawn \u0100\u1e6d\u1e6dah\u0101sa to strike off his head, when amid the wreath on his shoulder he detected the sacred thread. Forbearing his weapon, 'Villain,' he cried, 'this then is the seed of your career of ill-doing, this is whence you proceed without fear in your wicked courses,' and so let him go. Straightway as in a moment he beheld a great brightness; a perfume as of lotus beds opening in autumn smote upon his nostrils; instantaneously he heard a tinkle of anklets, and guided his glance in pursuit of the sound.\n\nIn the centre of the sword resting in his hand, like a lightning flash in the womb of a black cloud, he beheld a woman whose radiance seemed to swallow up the night. Her hands were like red lotuses. Like seaside coral beds clinging to her feet trailed the web-like rosy glow of her soft toes. [126] Disguised as her white toe-nails she bore along the splintered moon-disk, as if for fear her lotus hands should close\u00b9. Clasped anklets lay about her ankles, as though in her coming she had burst from a prison of thick linked chains. Out of a dazzling white silken robe, embroidered\n\n\u00b9 The night-lotus would close in the absence of the moon.\nwith hundreds of divers flowers and birds, and gently rippled by the motion of the breeze, her form rose up as from an ocean's waters. The *tribali* clasped her waist like the three-fold Ganges pleased at her birth from the deep\\(^1\\). Her round bust with its prominent bosoms was like the sky displaying the sky-elephants' frontal bones, and across her bosom, like the dew on the trunk of Air\u0101vata in his time of rut, lay a necklace with lustrous pearls like stars of autumn. Swayed like white chowries by her soft, soft breathing, the light of the necklace seemed to fan her. Her hands bore a naturally rosy tint, as if they had caught a vermillion tinge from slapping the forehead of a rut-blinded scent elephant\\(^2\\). Her flashing ear-ring shone like the second\\(^3\\) half of Hara's crest the moon, curved to a circle. Clinging about her ear was an ornament of *A\u00e7oka* shoots like a cluster of the Kaustubha's brightness. Her forehead lacked not a great sectarial line dark as elephant's ichor, like an unseen umbrella's circular shadow\\(^4\\). Moon-white sandal, like the glory of the kings of old, brightened her form from hair-parting to feet. Flowery wreaths, dangling from her throat and kissing the ground, flowed over her like rivers finding their repose in ocean\\(^5\\). Limbs soft as lotus fibres voicelessly proclaimed her lotus birth.\n\n'Who art thou, lady?' cried the king unappalled, 'and wherefore hast thou come within my sight?' 'Hero,' she said, almost overpowering him with an unabashedness at variance with her sex, 'know me to be that deer whose pleasure haunt is N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a's breast, the banner-pennon of Pr\u012bthu, Bharata, Bhagiratha and the other kings of old, [127] the gay doll upon the victory columns of heroes' arms, the flamingo wantoning\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Lak\u1e63m\u012b rose from the deep at the churning of the ocean.\n\n\\(^2\\) Lak\u1e63m\u012b's elephant is referred to. The *gandhadvipa* is a particularly powerful kind of elephant.\n\n\\(^3\\) Ciiva wears a *crescent* moon\u2014this was the second or *absent* half.\n\n\\(^4\\) The umbrella being a sign of sovereignty. *Mada* is described as dark like *Tam\u0101la* shoots in K\u0101dambar\u012b p. 243 i.; *tam\u0101la-pallava-rasa-\u00e7y\u0101mena madajalena*.\n\n\\(^5\\) I.e. as if they were the rivers which had flowed into the ocean from which she had risen at its churning.\nwith yearning to sport upon the waves of battle's bloodshed stream, the peacock of the thickets of kings' white umbrellas, even \u00c7ri, the lioness whose caprice is to roam in the forest of sharp scimitar edges, the lotus bed of the pools of sword-edge water. I am ravished by this thy valorous spirit. Crave of me a boon: I will give thee thy heart's desire.'\n\nHeroes are unwearied in serving others. So the king bowed to her, and heedless of his own advantage, besought the success of Bhairav\u0101c\u0101rya. Highly gratified, the goddess, anointing the king with her wide-open eyes like a milk ocean thrown over him, replied 'So be it,' and added, 'Because of this magnanimity of thine and because of thy superlative devotion to the holy Lord \u00c7iva thou, like a third added to the Sun and Moon, shalt be the founder of a mighty line of kings persisting unbroken upon earth, daily increasing in greatness, full of matchless heroes elate with purity, high-fortune, truth, munificence, and fortitude. Wherein shall arise an emperor named Har\u1e63a, governor like Hari\u00e7andra of all the continents, world-conquering like a second M\u0101ndh\u0101\u1e6dri, whose chowrie this hand, spontaneously abandoning the lotus, shall grasp.' So saying she vanished.\n\nThe heart of the king was beyond measure gratified to hear this. Bhairav\u0101c\u0101rya himself, having by the words of the goddess and the full performance of the rite instantly acquired the hair-lock, diadem, earring, necklace, armlet, girdle, hammer, and sword, became a Vidy\u0101dhara. Addressing the king he said:\u2014'The wishes, O king, of indolent feeble-minded people embrace not remote objects: but the favours of the good are of their very nature far-reaching. [128] To bestow this boon, unimagined even in dreams, who except your majesty had power? A man of light qualities is lifted up like a scale by the acquisition of a mere particle of success. Having been served by your virtues and having attained my purpose through none other than you, I am inspired by the immodesty of an infatuated heart. And so it is my wish to win remembrance by endeavouring in whatever way I can to afford you some grain of assistance.' The stout hearts of the wise, however, are proof against reciprocation of\nfavours, and the king therefore refused, saying, 'By your reverence's success my task is finished; let your reverence proceed to a station according with your wish.'\n\nAfter this reply from the king, Bhairav\u0101c\u0101rya, now on the point of departure, warmly embraced T\u012b\u1e6dibha and the others, and regarding the king with a tearful eye like a blue lotus-bed streaming with frosty dew, \"Friend,\" he resumed, \"should I say 'I am going,' that were a poor token of affection\\(^1\\); if I say 'my life is yours,' 'tis superfluous; 'make this poor body your own' would imply the creation of an unreal distinction; 'you have purchased me bit by bit,' the bits fall short of your kindnesses; 'you are my kinsman' would place a distance between us; 'my heart remains with you' would want evidence; 'a success which severs us is torment' would not find credence; 'your kindness was unmerited' a mere reiteration; 'keep me in remembrance' a command.\n\nAt least in all talk of ingrates and all narrations of ignoble people let me be remembered as one remorselessly bent on his own advantage.\" So speaking, he mounted to the sky, lashing the constellations with pearls that started from a necklace burst in his speed, and passed in an orbit cleaving the planet clusters to a station fitting his good-fortune. \u010crikan\u1e6dha also spoke; 'Deign, O king, whenever necessary to favour with your commands one bought by your valour and taught discretion,' [129] and so with the consent of the king entered again the same fissure in the earth.\n\nBy this the night was nearly spent. Fragrant with the breath of opening day-lotus beds, frosty as if with sweat from the sport of ravishing shawls from the bosoms of forest nymphs, the sylvan breeze had begun to blow, attracting the bees by its perfume, lulling the night-lotuses to sleep, chilled\n\n\\(^1\\) \u091a\u093e and \u0917\u0938\u094d are roots of ill-omen, which must not be used in conversation. When Macaulay talks of the Lucknow people singing songs in Hastings' honour\n\n'Hath\u012b par hau\u1e0da ghore par z\u012bn\nJaldi j\u0101o jaldi j\u0101o Warren Hastin.'\n\"Howdah on elephant, saddle on horse\n'Ride on in triumph W. H.'\nthey meant 'Go to hell, go to hell quickly, W. H.'\"\n\n---\n\n\\(^{[129]}\\)\nby the night's ending, and interspersed with rime. Scorched as it were by the sighs of ruddy-geese in the anguish of their severance, the night subsided into the western ocean. The lotus beds peeped forth, as if curious to view the bodily presence of Lak\u1e63m\u012b. As the birds awoke, the forest, quivering in all its creepers beneath the soft breeze, rained down showers of hoar-frost, like bunches of flowers. With their noisy imprisoned bees the closing night-lotuses hummed like auspicious horns to awake the beauty of the day-lotuses. The stars, buds of the creepers of night, clustered together in the western sky, as if wafted on by the panting breath of the rising sun's chariot-horses. Occupying Mandara's peak, the Seven Sages became grey, as if coated with pollen from thickets of heavenly creepers rocked by the gentle breeze. The Starry Deer as it sank seemed like a fallen goad\\(^1\\) of the gods' elephant.\n\nTaking Ti\u1e6dibha and the others, the king, whose limbs were befouled by the give and take of battle with the demon, bathed in the pure water of a sylvan pool. He then entered the city, and next day gratified all three with unguents, food, and clothing immediately after his own person\\(^2\\).\n\nAfter the lapse of a few days the mendicant, despite the king's remonstrances, departed to the woods. P\u0101\u1e6d\u0101lasv\u0101min [130] and Kar\u1e47at\u0101la, men of a warlike spirit, remained in the king's service. Elevated to a fortune beyond their wildest dreams, drawing their swords in the midst of the royal guard, occupying the front rank in the battle, now and then on occasion of story-telling appointed to narrate various actions of Bhairav\u0101c\u0101rya and incidents of their own childhood\\(^3\\), they arrived at old age by the king's side.\n\nHere ends the third Chapter\u2014entitled The Exposition of The King's Ancestry\u2014of the Har\u1e63a-Carita composed by \u00c7r\u012b B\u0101\u1e47a Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da.\n\n---\n\n1 A reference to the shape of the constellation, i.e. Capricorn, Comm.\n2 According to the Comm. he first makes the ascetic's friends bathe and then bathes himself.\n3 Cai\u00e7avav\u1e5btt\u0101nt\u0101\u1e25 seems to be here used much in the same way as the Welsh Mabinogion, which originally meant 'amusements of youth' but came to be the name for the collection of Welsh heroic legends.\nCHAPTER IV.\n\n[131] No alliance\\(^1\\) wish they even in dreams, they make no joining of hands\\(^2\\);\n\nBy the sole power of their name do the great become liege lords of the wedded earth!\n\nLike the tusk set at a wide interval\\(^3\\) in the capacious mouth of the elephant-headed god, so in a royal house though populous\n\nThere arises but one like to Prithu, causing all monarchs\\(^4\\) to shake!\n\nFrom\\(^5\\) this Pu\u1e63pabh\u016bti there issued a line of kings, as from Vi\u1e63\u1e47u a lotus whose calix the best of the twice-born voluntarily occupied\\(^6\\), as from the ocean a treasure of jewels attended by Lak\u1e63m\u012b\\(^7\\), as from the orient mount a troop of planets including Jupiter, Mercury, Venus, the Moon, the Sun, and Mars\\(^8\\), as from the might of Sagara a sea capable of supporting a commerce of greatness, as from C\u016bra a Hari race boasting a Durjaya and a Bala\\(^9\\).

The words for Vi\u1e63\u1e47u (\u2018lotus-eyed\u2019), ocean (\u2018collection of jewels\u2019), Orient Mount (\u2018source of greatness\u2019), might of Sagara (\u2018one mighty as Sagara\u2019), C\u016bra (\u2018hero\u2019) may all apply to Puspabh\u016bti, the others similarly to the race.\n6 Or \u2018whose treasures were grasped at will by the best of the twice-born (=Br\u0101hmans).\u2019 Brahma is the best of the twice-born.\n7 Or \u2018attended by splendour.\u2019\n8 Or \u2018including teachers, wise men, poets, artists, men of might, and kings.\u2019\n9 Or \u2018boasting invincible might.\u2019 Durjaya and Bala are Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and Bala-R\u0101ma.\nborn kings free from the stain of violating Dharma, [132] as living beings came from the commencement of the golden age; dominating the world by their splendour, like the rays from the source of light; thronging the regions with their armies in array, like the hills sprung from Brahm\u0101; strong to support the world, like the sky elephants born from Brahm\u0101\u2019s hand; rising in might to guard\u00b9 the oceans, like clouds from the season of rain; bestowing the fruits of desire, like trees of Paradise from the Heavenly Garden; embracing all beings, like the variations of existence sprung from Vi\u1e63\u1e47u.\n\nThe line so proceeding, there was born in course of time a king of kings named Prabh\u0101karavardhana\u00b2, famed far and wide under a second name Prat\u0101pa\u00e7\u012bla, a lion to the Hu\u1e47a deer, a burning fever to the king of the Indus land, a troubler of the sleep of Gujarat, a bilious plague to that scent-elephant the lord of G\u0101ndh\u0101ra, a looter to the lawlessness of the L\u0101\u1e6ds, an axe to the creeper of M\u0101lwa\u2019s glory. From his members of royalty the coronation water purged no foulness but filthy lucre\u00b3. Even an enemy\u2019s life, that coward\u2019s darling, when kept like a straw in the mouth of battle\u2074, filled him with shame. It was torture to him to be accompanied in battle even by his image in the sword-blade which his hand bore, torture that even his bow bent to the foe in conflict. A proud man, he was vexed by his proud ambitions. Steadfast he kept his royal majesty, as if pinned by the implanted\u2075 arrow-points of countless foes. [133] Levelling on every side hills and hollows, clumps and forests, trees and grass, thickets and anthills, mountains and caves, the broad paths of his armies seemed to portion out the earth for the support of his dependants. By deterring all enemies his own prowess\n\n\u00b9 Or \u2018drink.\u2019\n\u00b2 On the S\u014dnpat seal (Corpus Inscr.

In the seraglios of slain rivals his valour was, as it were, materialized in the form of the five elements, fire in the women's hearts, water in the hollows of their eyes, wind in their sighs, earth upon their forms, ether in the vacant solitude\\(^1\\). As in a mirror, his glory was matched in those gems among ministers who attended him\\(^2\\).\n\nOnce more:\u2014his greatness was made to glow by the fire of his valour, his success was digested by the heat of his courage, the growth of his race was fostered like a bamboo by the water of the sword's edge, his valorous deeds were proclaimed by the mouths of the wounds which his steel dealt, his grasping of tribute\\(^3\\) by the callosity of the bow string. A furious onslaught he counted a present, war a favour, the approach of battle a festival, a foe the discovery of a treasure, a host of enemies the acme of prosperity, a challenge to conflict a boon, a sudden onset an ovation, the fall of sword strokes a shower of wealth. Beneath his rule the golden age seemed to bud forth in close packed lines of sacrificial posts, the evil time to flee in the smoke of sacrifices meandering over the sky, heaven to descend in stuccoed\\(^4\\) shrines, Dharma to blossom in white pennons waving over temple minarets, the villages to bring forth a progeny of beautiful arbours erected on their outskirts for meetings, alms' houses, inns, and women's marquees\\(^5\\), Mount Meru to crumble in a wealth of utensils all of gold, a very cornucopia to bear fruit in bowls of riches lavished upon Br\u0101hmans.\n\nThis king had a queen, Ya\u00e7ovat\u012b\\(^6\\) by name, noble as \u00c7\u0101\u1e45kara's P\u0101rvat\u012b, but remaining Sat\u012b in another incarnation\\(^7\\), holding the heart fast like Vi\u1e63\u1e47u's Lak\u1e63m\u012b, with sparkling\n\n---\n\n1 Or 'their vacant hearts.'\n2 His ministers were gems reflecting his greatness.\n3 Or\u2014punningly\u2014'his hand's grasp.'\n4 Sudh\u0101=(1) stucco, (2) ambrosia.\n5 Pr\u0101gumcah=patni\u00e7\u0101l\u0101 is a hut erected on the sacrificial ground for the sacrificer's family.\n6 The S\u014dnpat seal has Ya\u00e7omati.\n7 I.e. she was sat\u012b=(1) noble, (2) \u00e7obhan\u0101 'blonde,' whereas P\u0101rvat\u012b's other incarnation was \u00e7y\u0101m\u0101 'brunette.'\nglancing eyes\\(^1\\) like the moon\u2019s Rohini, mother of all her people like Praj\u0101pati\u2019s Buddhi, descended from towering kings\\(^2\\) like the ocean\u2019s Ganges, deft in compliance to his will\\(^3\\) like the han\u1e63a-king\u2019s Han\u1e63\u012b, with an adoring world at her feet\\(^4\\) like Dharma\u2019s Triad, never abandoning his side night or day like Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha\u2019s Arundhat\u012b. She was endowed with the gait of a han\u1e63a, the voice of a cuckoo, the answering love of a ruddy-goose, the full bosoms\\(^5\\) of the rainy season, the laugh of wine, the manifold worth of a treasure, the rich gifts of a golden shower, the enfolded charms of a lotus, the fruitfulness of a flower, the adorableness of the twilight, the moon\u2019s freedom from heat, a mirror\u2019s responsiveness to all creatures, Samudra\u2019s\\(^6\\) intuition of character, the Supreme Spirit\u2019s universal penetration, the scriptures\u2019 stainless principles. She was honey in converse, ambrosia to those who sought delight\\(^7\\), rain to her servants, beatitude to her friends, bamboo-like to her elders. The pride was she of the family of smiles, the penance purity of womanhood, the fulfilment of K\u0101ma\u2019s ordinances, [135] the Eureka\\(^8\\) of loveliness, the ovation of passion, the fruition of beauty\u2019s wishes, the special providence of charm, the genesis of affection\u2019s ancestry, love\u2019s boon-winning, grace\u2019s perfect creation, youth\u2019s majesty, intelligence\u2019s cloudless rain\\(^9\\), glory\u2019s lustration, goodness\u2019 bloom of beauty, Dharma\u2019s heart\u2019s delight, Praj\u0101pati\u2019s creation of the atoms of bliss: the quietude of quiescence, the decorousness of decorum, the nobility of high birth, the temperateness of temperance, the stand of steadfastness, the witchery of grace. Such was the queen, the centre of all\n\n---\n\n1 Or\u2014punningly\u2014\u2018stars.\u2019\n2 Or \u2018mountains.\u2019\n3 Or \u2018visiting M\u0101nasa.\u2019\n4 Or \u2018schools\u2019: the Triad is the three Vedas.\n5 Or \u2018clouds.\u2019\n6 He is the inventor of palmistry: a literal rendering would be \u2018in knowledge of the characters of others she was the essence of Samudra\u2019s book.\u2019\n7 Or\u2014reading tri\u1e63yatsu\u2014\u2018to the thirsty.\u2019\n8 Vyutth\u0101nabuddhir\u2014the resultant thought of a yogin\u2019s meditation.\n9 \u2018Cloudless rain\u2019 is a synonym for \u2018a marvel.\u2019 Comm.\ncreatures' love, confidence, duty, and felicity, who upon the king's bosom shone like Lak\u1e63m\u012b on the bosom of Hell's Vanquisher.\n\nThe king was by natural proclivity a devotee of the sun\\(^1\\). Day by day at sunrise he bathed, arrayed himself in white silk, wrapt his head in a white cloth, and kneeling eastwards upon the ground in a circle smeared with saffron paste, presented for an offering a bunch of red lotuses set in a pure vessel of ruby and tinged, like his own heart, with the sun's hue\\(^2\\). Solemnly at dawn, at midday, and at eve he muttered a prayer for offspring, humbly with earnest heart repeating a hymn having the sun as its centre\\(^3\\).\n\nThe heavenly will can be won to favour its worshippers. So it happened that on the occasion of one hot season the king slept on his palace roof white with stucco spotless as the moon-light; and the queen lay on a second couch at his side. [136] The night was near its close, and the lord of stars was declining with faded radiance, robbed of his beauty by the approach of dawn. A cool frosty dew was falling, like the moon's sweat evoked by his delight as his finger tips\\(^4\\) touched the lotus beds. Smit by the breath of intoxicated sleeping beauties, the seraglio lamps staggered as if drunk. The king slept. The stars mirrored in his white nails seemed to be stroking his feet. His limbs were carelessly extended, as if consigned to the queens of the quarters. The beauty of his lips\\(^5\\) fanned him with wine-perfumed breath like the wind of her own lotus-like hand acting as a fan. In the clear surface of his cheek the imaged moon shone like a topknot of white flowers displaced by the clutching of hair in amorous dalliance.\n\nSuddenly with a cry 'Help, my lord! help' the queen leapt up, a tremour swaying her willowy form, and her tinkling anklets seeming to call out to her attendants.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) On the S\u014dnpat seal Har\u1e63a attaches the epithet param\u0101dityabhak-tuk to his father, brother, and other members of the family.\n\n\\(^2\\) There is a pun on anurakta=(1) devoted, (2) reddened.\n\n\\(^3\\) Cf. Weber Ind. Stud. ix. 91.\n\n\\(^4\\) I.e. 'rays.'\n\n\\(^5\\) I.e. the personified beauty of his face.\nInstantly, scorched as it were in both ears by a cry for help such as never in all the world he had heard, much less in his queen's mouth, the king awoke from sleep. With a right hand that trembled with rage he drew from beside his head a sword whose glittering edge drew a line like a prolongation of his ear-wreath across the night. His left hand swept aside his robe of fine muslin, as if it were the intervening ether. Loosened by his hand's furious movement, his golden bracelet flashed upon the heavens, as if his heart were roaming in search of the cause of alarm. He brought his left foot furiously down with a stamp that shook the palace. His necklace, which had fallen in front of him, having come within range of his sword edge, shone like a severed portion of the moonlight. Inflamed with rage and sleep, as if stained with betel from Lak\u1e63mi's kisses, his eyes cast a glow upon the whole circle of the heavens, [137] while a dark trident-shaped frown seemed to bring night back again, as he leapt up hastily crying, 'Fear not, my queen, fear not'. When however on casting his glance in every direction he saw nothing, he inquired of the queen the cause of her fright.\n\nBy this the women of the night watch had run up like family goddesses, and the servants who slept near were all awake. So now that the alarm which had made her heart tremble had subsided, the queen replied:\u2014'I know now, my lord. I saw in a dream two shining youths issue from the sun's disk, filling the heavens as with radiance of morning, and turning the whole world as it were into lightning. They wore crowns, earrings, armlets, and cuirasses; swords were in their hands; they were bathed in blood cochineal red. All the world bowed before them with upturned faces and hands joined reverently at their foreheads. Accompanied by one maid like a moon incarnate, who issued from the ray Su\u1e63um\u1e47a, they lighted upon the earth, and while I screamed, cut open my womb with a sword and essayed to enter. My heart quaked, and I awoke with a cry to my lord.'\n\nAt that juncture the morning horn rang out at the porch,\nlike the first utterance of the king\u2019s glory proclaiming the vision\u2019s fulfilment. Briskly sounded the tom-toms, as if to announce a coming exaltation. The daybreak drum boomed, as if pleased to be struck with the stick. \u2018Victory! Victory!\u2019 pealed the loud voices of those who recited well-omened calls from sleep. In the stable yard of the favourite horses the slowly rising marshal chanted a Vaktr\u0101 and an Aparavaktr\u0101 verse, as before the sweetly neighing steeds he scattered emerald grass a-drip with frosty water:\n\n[138] \u2018By misshapen trees a treasure, by flashing light a fine jewel,\n\u2018By an omen the approach of luck is clearly in the world revealed!\n\u2018As the dawn, his harbinger, announces the sun, as the speeding blast the rain\u2019s approach,\n\u2018Even so the appearance of a previous vision foretells good, yea and evil hap to men!\u2019\n\nAt these words the king\u2019s heart was filled with delight. \u2018Queen,\u2019 said he, \u2018you are dejected at the hour of joy. Your parents\u2019 prayers are answered. Our wishes are fulfilled. Our family goddesses have accepted you. In his graciousness the holy god of the radiant crown\u00b9 will grant you joy, and that soon, by the gift of three noble children.\u2019 So much said, he descended and performed the customary ceremonies. Ya\u00e7ovat\u012b also was cheered by her husband\u2019s words.\n\nAfter the lapse of a short period of time his majesty Rajyavardhana came first of three to being in the queen\u2019s womb. Even as he lay in the womb his glory shed a pallor over his mother. Oppressed as it were by the weight of his virtues, she could not support her frame. As if satisfied with the ambrosia of his outpouring loveliness, she became averse to food. Languid with the slowly growing burden of her child, she yet insisted on being conveyed with the support of friendly hands to salute her parents, who would have stayed her. In her lassitude she could be seen, like a doll-figure, propped against the nearest walls and trunks of trees. She could not lift her feet, which seemed checked by bees\n\n\u00b9 I.e. the Sun.\ngreedily settling upon such lotuses. Slow, slow was her gait, as if she were conducted by domestic hamsas clinging in greed for lotus threads to the rays of her toe-nails. Seeking a support, she would put forth a lotus hand even towards forms reflected in jewelled walls, much more then towards her women friends. She longed to clasp even the rays of gemmed pillars, much more the house-creepers. Her household duties she had scarce strength to command, not to speak of performing them. Needless to say that her feet were wearied by the burden of her anklets,\u2014even her imagination failed to mount the palace. She could not support even her limbs, much less her ornaments. [139] The very idea of climbing play hills made her bosom tremulously heave. When she should have risen in welcome, her child, as if through pride, kept her motionless with slender hands in vain applied to the points of her knees. All day long her downcast glance was turned in joy upon her zone, her lotus face brought near her bosom as if longing to see her child had drawn it inwards. With her child in her womb, and her husband in her heart, she bore as it were a double majesty. Resigning her form to her friends\u2019 bosoms, she set her feet on the laps of her handmaids, on the heads of her co-wives. When the tenth month arrived, she brought forth my lord R\u0101jyavardhana, a prince composed as it were of lightning atoms to quell the cabals of all kings\u00b9; capable of supporting the whole world\u2019s weight, as if endowed with the mechanism of \u00c7e\u1e63a\u2019s hood; heart-shaker of all kings\u00b2, as if constructed with the limbs of sky elephants. His birth was a birth of joy to the people, who became as it were dancing incarnate. For one month, which seemed a day, the king held a great festival, innumerable blown horns noisily sounding, hundreds of beaten tom-toms merrily booming, a world filled to overflowing with the burden of deep-rumbling drums, the hearts of all mankind ravished in a madness of delight.\n\n\u00b9 Or\u2014punningly\u2014\u2018to clip the wings of all mountains,\u2019 referring to a feat of Indra.\n\u00b2 Or \u2018mountains.\u2019\nA second period having elapsed, in the month\\(^1\\) of plantains, when the bud is on the Kadamba tree, the barley blades grow in clusters, the red-lotus stands erect, the c\u0101taka\u2019s heart expands, and the dwellers in M\u0101nasa are dumb, in that month Har\u1e63a came to being at once in the heart and womb of Ya\u00e7ovat\u012b, even as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in Devak\u012b. Gradually once more her willowy form, arrayed as it were in all her child\u2019s pure worth, assumed a pallid hue. As pregnancy came on, her cup-like bosoms grew dark in their tender nipples, as if stamped for an emperor to drain. Like a river of milk let into her face for her bosom\u2019s supply, her eye, long, moist\\(^2\\) and white, assumed a sweeter expression. Slow grew her gait beneath the load, as it were, of a frame weighed down by the whole array of auspicious marks. As she moved tardily about, [140] the earth, clasping her lotus feet mirrored in the spotless mosaic, seemed to pay her a prelude of worship. All day long as she lay on her couch, the reflection of figures embroidered in the awning rested on her cheek\u2019s clear round\\(^3\\), like a Lak\u1e63m\u012b awaiting the child\u2019s birth. In the night time, when she had mounted the roof, the moon\u2019s disk imaged in her round bosom, when bared of her shawl in the pangs of pregnancy, appeared like a white umbrella mysteriously held above her child. Even the chowrie women on the painted walls waved their chowries while she slept in her apartment. In her dreams all the four sky-elephants seemed to consecrate her, bearing water in folded lotus leaves held by their trunks. When she awoke, the puppet servants in the chamber on the roof raised not once alone the cry of \u2018Victory!\u2019 If she called to her maids, incorporeal voices went forth, crying \u2018Say your commands.\u2019 Even in play she would suffer no violation of her will\\(^4\\). Moreover a wish grew upon her to bathe even in the united waters of the four great\n\n---\n\n1. *Nabhas* = the month \u010cr\u0101vana, i.e. July\u2014August.

This and the following contain allusions to the superstition that the mother\u2019s mind echoes the thoughts of her child; hence the reference to the four oceans\u2014the limits of Har\u1e63a\u2019s empire, &c.\noceans. It was her heart's desire to roam round sand isles in creeper arbours by the sea shore. Even on occasions of urgency her brow would capriciously move. Despite the jewelled mirrors close to her hand she was bent on seeing her face in a drawn sword's blade. Supplanting the lute, the bow's twang, ill-suiting a woman, was pleasing in her ear. Her eye was gratified by lions in their cages. Even in saluting her parents she scarce could bend her apparently stiffened head. Her friends, never for an instant leaving her side, brightened the house, as in anticipation of the approaching birth festival, with eyes wide-open in joy, as though strewing on every side a ceaseless protective charm in the shape of a rain of blooming lotus petals, white, red and blue. Great physicians holding various herbs\u00b9 sat in their proper places, supporting her as the mountains support the earth. In the knots of her necklace-cord were fixed fine jewels, [141] like the hearts of the oceans come with Lak\u1e63m\u012b.\n\nAt length in the month Jyai\u1e63\u1e6dha, on the twelfth day of the dark fortnight, the Pleiads being in the ascendant, just after the twilight time, when the young night had begun to climb, a sudden cry of women arose in the harem. Hurriedly issuing forth, Suy\u0101tr\u0101, daughter of Ya\u00e7ovati's nurse and herself dearly beloved, fell at the king's feet, crying 'Good news! your majesty, you are blessed with the birth of a second son,' and carried off the customary festal spoil\u00b2.\n\nAt that very instant approached the astrologer T\u0101raka, a man very highly esteemed by the king. Hundreds and hundreds of times he had shown supernatural insight by announcing facts beyond the ken of man, a calculator, deeply read in\n\n\u00b9 Vividhosa\u1e0dhida\u1e47av\u0101s applies also to the mountains.

Since then in all the intervening time no second has in the whole world been born at a conjunction so fit for an universal emperor\u2019s birth. [142] The son now born to your majesty shall be coryphaeus of the Seven Emperors\\(^2\\), bearer of the Seven Imperial Signs\\(^3\\) and the Great Jewels\\(^4\\), lord of the Seven Oceans, performer of all sacrifices of Seven Forms\\(^5\\), the peer of him of the Seven Steeds\\(^6\\).\n\nInstantly unblown horns rang out spontaneously loud and sweet. Unbeaten boomed the consecration drum deep as the roar of oceans in turmoil. Unstruck the auspicious tabors pealed. Like a timbrel proclaiming security to all the world, the tabor\u2019s echo thrilled through the aerial spaces. Tossing their manes, the horses neighed with joy, while their muzzles were graced by wisps of green D\u016brv\u0101 sprays which they haughtily took. Sportively uplifting their trunks as if dancing, the elephants trumpeted in sounds grateful to the ear. Soon a heavenly breeze, fragrant with perfumes of wine, blew like a sigh of L\u0101k\u1e63m\u012b letting fall the disc\\(^7\\). In the courts of the sacrificers the unfed Vait\u0101na fires blazed up with flames curving to the right to foretell the coming luck. From the earth uprose great treasures, enclosed in cups bedecked with\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) For the Bhojakas or Magas see Wilson\u2019s Vi\u1e63\u1e47u P.

In the shape of echoes from the beaten tabors\nthe regents of the sky seemed joyfully to give forth a clamour\nof congratulation to the heavens. At that moment white-clad\nBr\u0101hmans approached with the Veda on their lips\\(^1\\), like the\nPraj\u0101patis of the golden age, to foster the new-born life. Like\nDharma incarnate came the family priest with lustral water\nand fruits ready in his hand. Like immemorial customs the\narriving elders of the family could be seen. Away ran dis-\norderly crowds of freed prisoners, their faces hairy with long\nmatted beards, their bodies black with many a miry smirch,\nlike the kindred of a waning Kali age. Like camp lines of a\nnow departed wickedness\\(^2\\) seemed the rows of shops, given\nup to general pillage\\(^3\\). In a great throng of boys danced the\nold nurses, encircled, like the young mother's tutelary deities\nincarnate, in a troop of dwarfs and deaf people with laughing\nupturned faces\\(^4\\). So proceeded the great birth festival, the\norder of the royal household gone, the pretence of chamber-\nlains laid low, the macebearers robbed of their maces, entrance\nto the harem in no wise criminal, master and servants reduced\nto a level, young and old confounded, learned and unlearned\non one footing, drunk and sober not to be distinguished, noble\nmaidens and harlots equally merry, the whole population of\nthe capital set a-dancing.\n\nFrom the morrow onwards the wives of the neighbouring\nkings could be observed in thousands approaching the palace\nfrom every side. Amazonian nations they seemed, pouring\nonwards, wide-opened mines, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a's mistresses on the march,\nfamilies of Apsarases lighted upon the earth. After them\nfollowed servants bearing garlands in wide baskets, with bath\npowder sprinkled upon the flowers; dishes laden with bits of\ncamphor, clear as crystal granules; jewelled caskets of saffron\nscents; ivory boxes, studded with rows of sandal-hued Areca\nnuts and tufted with slim Khadira fibres dripping mango oil;\n\n\\(^1\\) Brahmanukh\u0101s has two senses, (1) as in text, (2) 'headed by\nBrahm\u0101.'

As they danced, the quarters of the heavens rang with jewelled anklets clashing as their feet knocked together\\(^2\\).\n\n[144] Thus the festal jubilation gradually blossomed forth. Here young people, of ancient noble houses and unused to dancing, showed by frolics their love for the king. There drunken slave women allured the favourites, while the monarch himself looked on with a secret smile. In one place respectable old feudatories were, much to his amusement, clasping the necks of the intoxicated bawds of the capital in a furious dance. In another place naughty slave boys, set on by a glance from the sovereign, betrayed in songs the secret amours of the ministers of state. Elsewhere wanton water-girls raised a laugh by embracing aged ascetics. Elsewhere again in the eagerness of ardent rivalry throngs of slaves carried on a war of foul language. In another place chamberlains knowing nothing of dancing were, to the entertainment of the maids, violently forced to dance by the king's women. The festival showed mountains of flower heaps, rum-booths like shower-baths, Nandana forests of P\u0101rij\u0101ta scent, a hoar-frost of camphor dust, a booming of drums like \u010civa's laugh\\(^3\\), a hubbub like the ocean-churning, vortexes of dancing rings, a horripilation of rays from jewelled ornaments, a very tiara of sandal forehead marks, a never ceasing propagation of echoes, an endless efflorescence of tokens of favour.\n\nYoung men frolicked in thousands, prancing, like K\u0101mboja steeds, with garlands of Ke\u00e7aras\\(^4\\) hanging upon their shoulders, leaping with dancing eyes like spotted antelopes\\(^5\\),\n\n---\n\n1 Read -vitik\u0101v\u012b\u1e6dak\u0101mceca.

Scarce could the earth sustain the tramp of troubadours dancing to time. Smash went the pearls in the ornaments of the young princes slapping each other in their play. [145] Minium dust crimsoned the shell of Brahm\u0101's egg\\(^1\\) in every part, as with the blood of a reproduced Hiranya-Garbha foetus. The heavens gleamed with clouds of perfume powder, as if Mand\u0101kini had disclosed a thousand sand isles. Yellowed with scattered scent dust, the daylight glowed, as though Brahm\u0101's lotus, ground by the rocking world, had stained it with clouds of pollen from its filaments. Men tripped over heaps of pearls that fell from necklaces broken in collisions.\n\nIn this place and in that harlot-women danced to the accompaniment of instrumental music. Tambourines were slowly, slowly thumped; reeds sweetly piped, cymbals tinkled, string drums were belaboured, the low gourd lute sang, gently boomed the k\u0101halas with their brazen sounding boxes, while all the time a subdued clapping proceeded. Even the clank of jingling anklets kept time pace by pace, as if intelligent, with the clapping. Whispering softly, like cuckoos, in low passionate tones, they sang the words of vulgar mimes, ambrosia to their lovers' ears. Wreaths were about their brows, and chaplets round their ears, upon their foreheads sandal marks. With upraised creeper-like arms, vocal with rows of bracelets, they seemed to embrace the very sun. Like Kashmir colts, they leapt all aglow with saffron stains\\(^2\\). Great garlands of amaranth hung down upon their round hips, as if they were ablaze with passion's flame. Their faces, marked with rows of vermillion spots, seemed to wear the rubric of the edict plates of Love, [146] whose ordinances none may resist. Dusty were they with camphor and perfumes scattered in handfuls, like roads frequented by the desires\\(^3\\) of youth. Like women chamberlains of a children's festival, they lashed the young folk\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) = the world.\n\n\\(^2\\) As applied to the colts kunkumapramr\u012b\u1e63\u1e6di means 'rolling in saffron.'\n\n\\(^3\\) Lit. 'mind-chariots.'\nwith great wreaths of flowers. With tossing forehead marks and earrings they swayed\\(^1\\) like creepers of Love\u2019s sandal tree. Like waves of passion\u2019s flood, they gleamed all resonant with the cries of anklets\\(^2\\) adding music to their steps. As to what was proper to be said or not, they were as void of discrimination as the childish play of happiness. While the rapid booming of the drums\\(^3\\) thrilled through their lithe frames, they cast off flower pollen, like Ketakis. All day their faces were, like red lotuses, abloom; by night they slept no more than night lotuses. As if possessed, they were surrounded by throngs of princes\\(^4\\). Like endearments, they stole away the heart; like songs, they kindled the flame of desire; like the symptoms of stoutness\\(^5\\), they gave rise to joy. Adding passionateness to passion itself, a glow to love, a joy to joy, a dancing motion to dancing, festivity to festival, in ogling they seemed to drink with the white (shells) of their eyes, in scolding to imprison in cages of rays from their nails, in gestures of anger to lash with curling eyebrows, in making love to pour a rain of all (sweet) feelings, in deftly moving to scatter transformations.\n\nIn other places, where under the terror of chamberlains\u2019 wands the people had made room, [147] the king\u2019s wives essayed the dance, a brilliant\\(^6\\) throng with a forest of white parasols held above them, as if they were wood nymphs roaming beneath trees of paradise. Some, wrapt in loose shawls hanging from both shoulders, swayed as if mounted on play swings. Some, with wavy robes torn by the edge of golden armlets, were like rivers lined by crossing ruddy-geese. Others, whose bright side glances were bounded by earrings entangled in tufts of white waving chowries, were like pools\n\n---\n\n1 The Bombay text has lasantyo \u2018flashing.\u2019 The words for \u2018forehead marks\u2019 and \u2018earrings\u2019 may be for the sake of the simile translated \u2018bunches of leaves.\u2019\n\n2 Or\u2014punningly\u2014\u2018of hamsas.\u2019\n\n3 Or\u2014punningly with the ketakis\u2014\u2018the booming of clouds.\u2019\n\n4 Or \u2018magicians.\u2019\n\n5 It is a great cause of congratulation when a Hindu grows fat,\u2014they hold it implies a virtuous life and a good conscience.\n\n6 The Bombay text has vilesur for virejur.\nwith hamsas plucking at forests of blue lotuses\\(^1\\). Others, from whose tripping feet\\(^2\\) trickled a dew of lac-reddened sweat that besprinkled the palace hamsas, resembled moonlight nights when the twilight casts a glow upon the moon\u2019s disk. Others, with brows curved in derision at the contortions of chamberlains bending beneath golden girdles placed about their necks, seemed love-nets with outstretched arms for toils.\n\nAll womankind being thus set dancing, the earth, crimsoned by trickling lac from their feet, seemed rosy with the flush of love. Their round gleaming bosoms made the festival like a mass of auspicious pitchers\\(^3\\). Their tossing arms caused the world to seem nought but rings of lotus roots. Their sparkling playful smiles created as it were a season all of lightning flashes. The days seemed dappled by the light of dancing eyes. Brilliant ear chaplets of \u00c7iri\u015fa flowers cast a green tint upon a daylight seemingly of parrots\u2019 tails. Dark hanging Tam\u0101la sprays of braided hair shed a blackness as of collyrium on the prospect. Uplifted tendril-like hands made all creation gleam like one red lotus-bed. The radiance of rainbow-tinted gems infused a colour of jays\u2019 wings into the sunlight. Echoing with clusters of tinkling ornaments, the heavens seemed nought but clanging bells. Even old ladies shouted like maniacs. [148] Old men even lost all shame, as though bewitched. The wise forgot themselves, as if intoxicated. Even hermits\u2019 hearts were all agog for a dance. The king gave away all his fortune. Heaps of wealth, like Kuvera\u2019s treasuries, were plundered by the folk on every side.\n\nThis great festival ended, another period of time passed gradually by. R\u0101jyavardhana was now nearing his sixth year, while his majesty Har\u1e63a could just manage five or six paces with the support of his nurse\u2019s finger. His majesty wore upon his head a mustard amulet, like a spark of his valour\u2019s fire just peeping forth. His form was stained yellow with gorocan\u0101,\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Their eyes are the blue lotuses, the white chowries the hamsas, and the earrings their beaks.\n\n\\(^2\\) Or\u2014punningly\u2014\u2018speeding rays.\u2019\n\n\\(^3\\) A pitcher full of water is an auspicious omen.\nas if his inborn warrior's prowess were coming to light. His neck was ornamented with a row of great tiger's claws linked with gold, like buds of pride bursting from his heart. He could manage a child's first indistinct cries, the prelude as it were of truth. His innocent smiles won his kinsmen's hearts, as flowers do bees. Tiny teeth, growing like buds of happy smiles and watered with the dew of his mother's cuplike breasts, were beginning to adorn his lotus mouth. The womenfolk in the harem safeguarded him like honour; the ministers of state preserved him like a state secret; the young nobles held fast to him as to virtue; his kindred cherished him like the family prestige; the swords of guards caged him in like a lion's whelp.\n\nIt was at this time that queen Ya\u00e7ovat\u012b became pregnant with R\u0101jya\u00e7r\u012b, even as N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a's form with the earth. And when the time of her delivery was come, as the pool gives birth to the lotus bed with its long red stalks and roots\u00b9, as the rains to the autumn sweetly vocal with wild geese\u00b2, as the spring to woodrows with their limbs all fair with\u00b3 flowers, [149] as the sky to the shower of wealth flashing with grains of gold, as the tide to gems with a flood of light, as the new-moon time to the crescent which delights all men's eyes, as \u00c7ac\u012b to Jayant\u012b a sight for a thousand eyes\u2074, as Men\u0101 to Gaur\u012b wooed by all mountains\u2075, so Ya\u00e7ovat\u012b gave birth to a daughter, who added to the two sons formed a further ornament, like the line of a necklace above her two bosoms.\n\nAbout this time Ya\u00e7ovat\u012b's brother presented his son Bha\u1e47\u1e0di, a boy about eight years of age, to serve the young princes. Tufted with tossing side-locks of curly hair, the boy was like a reborn K\u0101ma with his head encircled by the smoke line of the flame of \u00c7iva's anger. Darkened on one side of his body by an earring of sapphire, whitened on the other by the light of a pearl in his ear-ornament, he was like\n\n\u00b9 Or\u2014punningly\u2014'with long lotus eyes.'\n\u00b2 Or 'with a voice sweet as a wild-goose's.'\n\u00b3 Or 'tender as flowers.'\n\u2074 Sahasr\u0101k\u1e63a is also a name of Indra, 'for the God of the Thousand Eyes.'\n\u2075 Or 'kings.'\na compound Avatar of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and \u00c7iva. A diamond bracelet bound about his stout forearm suggested a rejuvenated Para\u00e7u-R\u0101ma, betokened by the cord of his axe, which was itself all worn away in his slaughter of the K\u1e63atriyas. Curved bits of coral were tied to his neck string, as if he were a reincarnate Hiranyak\u0101cipu wearing bits of Narasimha\u2019s claws broken against his adamantine breast. Though still a child, he bore himself stiffly, like a seed of the tree of valour.\n\nTo this additional son the king\u2019s regard was equally attached, as \u00c7iva\u2019s sight to his third eye. [150] The princes also, the heart\u2019s joy of all creatures, derived a greater splendour from the company of this naturally courtly child, as do April and May when accompanied by the southern Malaya breeze. Growing in due course step by step with a fourth brother, as it were, namely the people\u2019s joy\u00b9, they came to manhood. With stout thighs like pillars, forearms broad as propylaea, long arms like bars, wide chests like panels, stately as tall ramparts\u00b2, they were like the gateway of a great city strong to afford refuge to a whole world.\n\nCharming\u00b3 were they and not to be gazed upon, like sun and moon overpowering the world by the flame of their flashing splendour and effulgence; manifested, like fire and wind, in radiance and power; adamantine in the hardness of their frames, like the immovable Him\u0101laya and Vindhya in conjunction; fit to bear the yoke of the K\u1e5bita age, like two great bulls; like Aru\u1e47a and Garu\u1e0da, borne on horses and well-proportioned\u2074; like Indra and Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, with the gait of elephants\u2075; like Kar\u1e47a and Arjuna, bedecked with ring and diadem; like the eastern and western heavens, capable of procuring the uprising and setting of all great lights.

They scorned the very shadows [151] averted from the light; they blushed that even their reflections should approach men's toe-nails; they were pained at the coward breaking even of one of their hairs; they felt shame at the second umbrella mirrored in their crest-jewels. The name of master, even as given to the Six-faced God\\(^2\\), grated upon their ears; a counterpart, even as seen in their mirror, caused their eyes to smart; to clasp hands even in twilight adoration seemed to plunge a spear into their brows; the very bow borne by the clouds distressed their hearts: even painted kings that would not bow appeared to burn their feet. They honoured not even the sun's light, content with a bounded sphere; they scoffed even at the ocean, whose Glory was carried away by a mountain (Mandara)\\(^3\\); they sneered at the potent wind that wore no warlike shape\\(^4\\). It was torture to them that even Him\u0101laya should be fanned by Yaks' tails, agony that the very seas should have their conchs, intolerable that even Varu\u1e47a should be a rival overlord of the four oceans. The very monarchs, whose parasols they seized not, they left void of splendour\\(^5\\). Gracious though uncourted, they poured honey with their lips even upon unassuming people\\(^6\\). The stocks of evil kings, however far removed, their hot anger caused to wither. Day after day their hands, begrimed with the marks of sword play, seemed defiled by quenching the fire of all other monarchs' prowess. By the deep twang of their bows at recreation time they seemed conversing after recent dalliance with the queens of the quarters. Thus were the names R\u0101jyavardhana and\n\n---\n\n1 Comp. Dryden, 'Cooped up he seemed in earth and seas confined.'\nM\u0101na may mean 'size,' as well as 'pride.'\n\n2 K\u0101rtikeya.\n\n3 At the churning of the ocean: otherwise 'whose glory was carried off by kings.'\n\n4 Or 'made no war.'\n\n5 A pun on ch\u0101y\u0101, as meaning 'shadow' and 'splendour.'\n\n6 Or\u2014punningly\u2014'even upon the temperate their lips, though they were not addicted to wine, rained wine.'\nHar\u1e63a proclaimed abroad over all the earth, in so much that in a very little time they attained to fame in other Continent Isles likewise.\n\n[152] One day their father, having summoned them, retired in their company after dinner to his private apartments and affectionately addressed them:\u2014'My dear sons, it is difficult to secure good servants, the first essential of sovereignty. In general mean persons, making themselves congenial, like atoms, in combination, compose the substance of royalty\\(^1\\). Fools, setting people to dance in the intoxication of their play, make peacocks of them\\(^2\\). Knaves\\(^3\\), working their way in, reproduce as in a mirror their own image. Like dreams, impostors by false fantasies beget unsound views. By songs, dances, and jests unwatched flatterers\\(^4\\), like neglected diseases of the humours, bring on madness. Like thirsty c\u0101takas, low-born persons\\(^5\\) cannot be held fast. Cheats, like fishermen\\(^6\\), hook the purpose at its first rise in the mind, like a fish in M\u0101nasa. Like those who depict infernos, loud singers paint unrealities on the canvas of the air\\(^7\\). Suitors\\(^8\\), more keen than arrows, plant a barb in the heart. [153] For these reasons I have appointed to wait upon your highnesses the brothers Kum\u0101ragupta and M\u0101dhavagupta, sons of the M\u0101lwa king, inseparable as my arms from my side; they are men found by frequent trials untouched by any taint of vice, blameless, discreet, strong, and comely. To them your highnesses also will show a consideration not enjoyed by the rest of your dependants.'\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) P\u0101rthiva has double meaning, (1) royal, (2) earthen, 'the substance of earth.'

After a brief interval the two princes, whose eyes were fixed upon the entrance, saw Kum\u0101ragupta, the elder brother, entering with the chamberlain. He was a young man neither very tall nor very short, in age about eighteen years. He planted weighty steps, as if to steady the ground, which trembled with the movements of numerous kings. A pair of rather slim shanks, issuing from not over-prominent knee joints, sallied as it were from thighs showing thick hard flesh of compact growth due to incessant practice in leaping. His hollow sides tapered at the waist, as if his middle, like that of Mandara, had been rubbed down by the serpent V\u0101suki when whirled about in the fury of gods and Asuras. A chest of vast breadth offered room for unbounded feelings of respect for his master. With quiet and graceful motions his pendulous arms appeared to be carrying him across the not easily traversed ocean of manhood. Upon his stout forearm, where it was marked by the bowstring\u2019s scar, shone a spray of light from the jewelled bracelet of his left wrist, like a sprouting bud of his valour\u2019s fiery flame. From the jewel of his ear-ornament there descended upon his huge shoulder a tawny light, like an antelope skin worn in sign of dedication to the use of arms\u00b9. His face, whose cheeks reflected the decorated figures of armlets with upstanding points, suggested a moon with Rohi\u1e47\u012b set in its heart. A downcast eye with pupil fixed and still seemed to give a lesson in decorum to the lotuses, whose faces are uplifted with desire for Lak\u1e63mi\u00b2.\n\nFor a crest he bore an \u0100ml\u0101taka flower, like his loyalty, upon his head. He displayed a graceful flexibility such as might have been presented by a nation of bows affrighted by his merciless breaking of their rings. He derived a dignity from senses conquered even in boyhood and, like conquered foes, kept well under his control. The law of princely nobility was the trusted mistress whom he followed. Resplendent as he was, the noble nature within made his brilliance soothing as a sun with a moon inside it. From the hardness of his\n\n\u00b9 Cf. Manu ii. 41.\n\u00b2 Or \u2018glory.\u2019 This prince, though desirous of glory, had a downcast look.\nframe he seemed to wear down the very mountains. His happy graciousness was as if he were selling to joy the people whom he purchased by his look.\n\nBehind him came his younger brother M\u0101dhavagupta, who for height and dignity\\(^1\\) resembled a moving realgar mountain. In the guise of a low topknot of M\u0101lat\u012b flowers great glory seemed to be imprinting upon his head a father\u2019s\\(^2\\) kiss at going forth. His meeting brows seemed to bespeak the late union of those irreconcilables, youth and decorum. With profound gravity he kept his gaze fixed, like his loyal devotion, upon his heart. Cooled by a smearing of the purest sandal paste and provided with a pillow in the shape of his necklace, his breast was like a broad slab of moonstone for glory to rest upon when wearied by her round of brief visits to numberless rival kings. He had the eye of a gazelle, the nose of a boar, the broad shoulders of a buffalo, the forearm of a tiger, the prowess of a lion, the gait of an elephant, bribes, as it were, offered by the frightened creatures after losing all else in the chase.\n\n[155] Entering, they bowed from afar till their four limbs\\(^3\\) and heads touched the ground, then assumed a suitable position indicated by a kindly glance from the king. After a momentary pause he gave them instructions from that day forth to wait upon the princes. \u2018As your majesty commands\u2019 they answered, and rising, saluted R\u0101jyvardhana and Har\u1e63a by swaying their heads again and again to the earth. They on their part saluted their father. From that hour the two were, like opening and shutting, never absent from the range of the princes\u2019 eyes,\u2014like inspiration and expiration, night and day before their mouths,\u2014like a pair of arms, ever constant at their side.\n\nMeanwhile R\u0101jya\u00e7r\u012b gradually grew up in daily increasing familiarity with friends expert in song, dance &c. and with all accomplishments. In a comparatively limited period she came to maturity. On her alone fell the glances of all kings,\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Or\u2014punningly\u2014\u2018yellowness.\u2019\n\n\\(^2\\) Gur\u016b\u1e47\u0101 = (1) great, (2) father.\n\n\\(^3\\) Sc. their knees and hands.\nlike arrows on the targe, and sending envoys, monarchs sought her hand.\n\nOne day the king, standing on the roof of the seraglio, heard a man in the outer court sing an \u0101ry\u0101 couplet which had suggested itself to him:\u2014\n\n'At the time of the bosoms\u00b9 swelling, growing with the passing of each rainy season,\n'A daughter brings low her father, like a river its bank, in a whirlpool of agitation.'\n\nHearing this, the king dismissed the servants, and said to the queen at his side:\u2014'Our darling R\u0101jya\u00e7r\u012b, my queen, is now grown a young woman. The thought of her, like her noble qualities, never for a moment leaves my heart. As soon as ever girls near maturity, their fathers become fuel to the flame of pain. The swelling of her bosoms\u00b9 darkens my heart, as clouds the day. [156] It is a law of right, by whomsoever framed not with my consent, that children born of our body, dandled at our breasts, never to be abandoned, are taken from us by the unexpected arrival of someone unknown to us. Truly, these indeed are the brandmarks of this transient life. Herein has sorrow's fire more than in aught else a power to burn, that whereas both are our offspring good men grieve at a daughter's birth. Hence is it that to their daughters noble men offer water even at birth\u00b2 in their tears. For this fear sages, neglecting marriage, dispensing with domestic life, take refuge in desolate forests. Who indeed can bear to part with a child? The more that suitors' envoys flock in, the deeper does wretched anxiety retire, as if abashed, into my heart. What can we do? In spite of all, householders must follow the ways of the world. In general too, though a bridegroom may have other merits, the wise especially incline towards good family. Now at the head of all royal houses stand the Mukharas, worshipped, like \u00c7iva's foot-print, by all the world. Of that race's pride, Avantivarman, the eldest son, Grahavarman by name, who lacks not his father's virtues, a prince like the lord of planets\n\n\u00b9 Or\u2014punningly\u2014'clouds.'\n\u00b2 Water is offered to the dead at a funeral (jal\u0101\u00f1jali): see Colebrooke's Essays, vol. ii. p. 177.\ndescended upon earth, seeks our daughter. Upon him, if your majesty's thoughts are likewise favourable, I propose to bestow her.'\n\nTo these her husband's words the queen with tearful eyes and a heart alarmed by love for her daughter replied:\u2014\n\n'Mothers, your majesty, are to their daughters no more indeed than nurses, useful only in rearing them. In their bestowal the father is the judge. Love for a daughter however far far exceeds love for a son, pity causing the difference. My lord only knows how all our lives long she is a care to us.'\n\nHis resolution taken in the matter of his daughter's bestowal, the king sent for his sons and acquainted them also with his purpose. Then on a day of good omen, in the presence of the whole royal household, he poured the betrothal water upon the hand of an envoy extraordinary, who had arrived previously with instructions from Graha-varman to sue for the princess.\n\n[157] He having gleefully departed with his mission accomplished, the royal household, as the marriage days drew near, assumed an aspect brilliant, charming, exciting, and auspicious. All the world bedecked itself with betel, perfumes, and flowers, distributed with a lavish hand. From every country were summoned companies of skilled artists. Under the charge of royal officers came whole villages, bringing loads of serviceable gifts. Emissaries conveyed presents from many a king. The favourites busied themselves in the disposal of troops of relatives, come in answer to invitations. Leather workers, wild with intoxication\u2014having been treated with wine\u2014flourished in their hands drumsticks, with which they sharply struck the festal drums, till they boomed again. Mortars, pestles, stone blocks and other utensils were bedecked with pounded perfumes\u00b9. Successive trains of troubadours, appearing on every side, crowded the courts, where images of Indr\u0101\u1e47\u012b were being set up. Carpenters, presented with white flowers, unguents,\n\n\u00b9 For pi\u1e63\u1e6dapa\u00f1ca\u1e45gula cf. supra p. 45, and the J\u0101taka (ed. Fausb\u00f6ll) ii. p. 256, ll. 2\u20133.\nand clothes, planned out the marriage altar. Workmen mounted on ladders, with brushes upheld in their hands and plaster pails on their shoulders, whitened the top of the street wall of the palace. Torrents of water from pounded saffron now being washed stained the feet of the nation. The courtyards were seas of elephants and horses, suitable for bridal gifts, which were undergoing inspection. Throngs of astrologers, set calculating, investigated the characteristics of different moments. Crocodile-mouthed conduits, conveying scented water, filled a variety of pleasure ponds. The outer terraces resounded with the din of gold-workers engaged in hammering gold. Plasterers were beplastered with showers of sand which fell over them from freshly erected walls. A group of skilled painters painted auspicious scenes. Multitudes of modellers moulded clay figures of fishes, tortoises, crocodiles, cocoanuts, plantains, and betel trees. Even kings girt up their loins, and busied themselves in carrying out decorative work set as tasks by their sovereign, being variously engaged in polishing mosaic floors of red lead, or erecting the posts for marriage platforms, which they strewed with handfuls of liquid \u0101tar-pa\u1e47a pigment, reddened with cochineal disposed about them, and adorned at the top with mango and A\u1e63oka twigs.\n\nFrom the furthest orient had come the queens of all the feudatories, noble, high-bred, shapely, well-clad, unwidowed dames with lines of vermilion powder glittering on their foreheads. Thronging the household, they sang sweet well-omened songs containing allusions to the bride and bridegroom's families; or with fingers steeped in divers colours dyed neck-strings; or employed their skill in leaf and plant painting to adorn polished cups and collections of unbaked clay-ware; or stained skeins of cotton thread for bamboo baskets and fabrics of wool for marriage amulets; or manufactured cosmetics, compounded of saffron paste clotted by bala\u1e47a essence, and face unguents adding distinction to beauty; or made strings of cloves mingled with Kakkola fruit, containing also nutmegs, and large bright lumps of crystalline camphor threaded in the intervals.\nThe palace was arrayed in textures flashing on every side like thousands of rainbows, textures of linen, cotton, bark silk, spider's thread, muslin, and shot silk, resembling sloughs of snakes, soft as the unripe plantain's fruit, swaying at a breath, imperceptible except to the touch. Some were being made by ancient city matrons, cunning in divers ways of cutting and measuring; some, made already, were being dyed by washermen, who beamed with respect for the courtly old ladies of the harem; some, after dyeing, had been shaken by servants clinging to either end, and were drying in the shade; some, now dry, were having all the charm of sprays reproduced in their twisted shapes: in some cases the spotting with saffron paste had been begun, and in others the fragile stuffs were torn, while grasped by servitors, who lifted their arms to clutch them. Couches, whose gay coverlets cast the *hamsa* tribes into the shade; bodices overlaid with starlike pearls; countless thousands of canvas and cloth pieces, divided up for various uses; [159] awnings bright with soft, freshly dyed bark silk; marquees, whose roofs were covered all over with garments, and posts swathed in strips of variegated silk; all these gave to the court an aspect brilliant, attractive, exciting, and auspicious.\n\nThe queen Ya\u00e7ovat\u00ee, though only one person, seemed in the flurry of the marriage festival multifariously divided, her heart being with her husband, her curiosity with the bridegroom, her love with her daughter, her attentions with the invited ladies, her injunctions with the servants, her body accompanying her motions, her eyes busy in looking after things done and omitted, her joy permeating the festival. The king likewise ever and anon despatched a female camel to his gratified son-in-law, and however apt the servants, intently watching his face, might be in executing his orders, yet in the distraction of fatherly affection he did everything in person along with his two sons.\n\nThus the royal household became as it were the essence of freedom from widowhood; a world seemed born full of auspiciousness; the prospect seemed composed of troubadours, the sky turned into drums, the roaming domestics to be all\nornament, creation looked nought but relatives, time appeared composed of bliss, the splendid festival seemed to blossom forth with all Lak\u1e63mi\u2019s bloom. It was as if there were a treasure trove of happiness, a realisation of life\u2019s purpose, a ripening of good deeds, a youth of felicity, a new reign of delight, a fulfilment time of desires. Calculated as it were by the people\u2019s fingers, watched for by the banners on the highways, welcomed by reverberations of auspicious music, invoked by astrologers, attracted by wishes, embraced by the hearts of the bride\u2019s women friends, the marriage day arrived.\n\nInstantly at dawn all strangers were expelled by the chamberlains, and the royal family was drawn apart.\n\nAnon the groom-in-waiting, having entered, introduced a young man of fair exterior, saying, \u2018A betel-bearer, your majesty, by name P\u0101rij\u0101taka, arrived from the bridegroom\u2019s presence.\u2019 With a graciousness due to esteem for his son-in-law the king inquired of the man while still at a distance, \u2018Young sir, is Grahavarman well?\u2019 Hearing the king\u2019s voice, he advanced a few paces at a run, and stretching out his arms, courtier that he was, bent his head for some time to the earth; then rising said, \u2018He is well, as your majesty observes, and sends respectful greetings to your majesty.\u2019 Understanding him to have come with tidings of the bridegroom\u2019s arrival, the king after offering hospitality sent him back with this charge, \u2018At the first watch of the night see that no mishap arise owing to the passing of the marriage hour.\u2019\n\nWhen the day was ended, having transferred to the bride\u2019s face as it were the beauty of all his lotus beds, while the sun glowed like the foot of the bridal day\u2019s loveliness; when the pairs of ruddy-geese were parting in shame, as it were, that their love should be eclipsed by the bride and bridegroom\u2019s affection; when, flecked like a pigeon\u2019s throat\u00b9, the afterglow, with its delicate texture of red silken rays,\n\n\u00b9 The word kapotakau\u1e6dhakarbure is best taken with the \u2018afterglow\u2019 and not with what follows: karbura may mean \u2018yellow\u2019 or \u2018golden.\u2019 For the \u2018yellow\u2019 cf. Psalm 68. 13 Sept.: \u03c0\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03c5\u03b3\u03b5\u03c2 \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u1fb6\u03c2 \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c0\u03c1\u03b3\u03c5\u03c1\u03c9\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c4\u1f70 \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03ac\u03c6\u03c1\u03b5\u03bd\u03b1 \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u1f10\u03bd \u03c7\u03bb\u03c9\u03c1\u03cc\u03c0\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9 \u03c7\u03c1\u03c5\u03c3\u03af\u03bf\u03c5.\ngleamed like the banner of felicity in the sky; when the dark, like the dust of the bridegroom's approaching train, was be-smirching the heavenly spaces, and, as if all ready to effect the favourable conjunction, the starry array was rising; while, like an auspicious marriage bowl, the moon's disk was shooting up with ever growing\\(^1\\) halo of whiteness from the Udaya hill, and, as the lovely radiance of the bride's face swallowed up the dusky gloom, the night-lotus beds with faces supine seemed to scoff at the idly-risen moon: [161] then true to his time the bridegroom drew nigh. Before him with red gold-studded chowries incessantly flashing ran footmen, like desires with the topmost shoots of passion standing out. The horizon was filled with troops of horses, which were welcomed, as it seemed, by answering neighs from the prick-eared steeds of the capital. Throngs of mighty elephants with chowries waving at their ears, arrayed in trappings all of gold, with gay housings and twanging bells, seemed to re-form the darkness dissolved by the rising moon. He came mounted on an elephant whose muzzle was bedecked with a zodiac of pearls\\(^2\\), even as the lord of night rides the eastern heaven. All about him was a hubbub of dancing troubadours shrilling forth the notes of divers birds, as when the new spring comes with his groves\\(^3\\). An array of lamps, incensed with dripping perfumed oil, made yellow all the world as with a cloud of saffron toilet powder. His head, with its flowery topknot set amid a blooming jasmine wreath, seemed to laugh to scorn the moonlit evening with its halo and its moon. He had formed for himself a mock va\u012bkak\u1e63aka wrap with a wreath of flowers, like a flowery bow taken from K\u0101ma vanquished by his beauty. Joyous with the low hum of bee tribes delirious with pride in the fragrance of the flowers, he resembled a Tree of Paradise born and descended again with \u010cr\u012b upon the earth. His heart drawn on as in eagerness\n\n---\n\n1 Vardham\u0101na also means a 'dish.'\n2 Nak\u1e63atram\u0101l\u0101=(1) 'the moon's asterisms,' (2) 'a string of 27 pearls.'\n3 Cf. Kipling, Beast and Man in India, p. 225: 'In Western India the bridegroom rides, covered with tinsel and gay clothing, in the midst of a moving square of artificial flowers and bushes, counterfeiting a garden, borne on long platforms on the heads of coolies.'\nto behold his new bride's countenance, he appeared almost to fall forward on his face.\n\nOn his arrival at the gate the king and his sons, accompanied by their royal retinue, went forth on foot to meet him. Dismounting he bowed, and the king with outstretched arms gave him a hearty embrace, like Spring embracing K\u0101ma. Next in order he embraced R\u0101jyavardhana and Har\u1e63a, and the king, taking him by the hand, led him within doors, where he honoured him with a seat equal to his own and with other attentions.\n\nSoon Gambh\u012bra, a wise Br\u0101hma\u1e47a attached to the king, said to Grahavarman, 'My son, by obtaining you R\u0101jya\u00e7r\u012b has at length united the two brilliant lines of Pu\u1e63pabh\u016bti and Mukhara, whose worth, like that of the Sun and Moon houses, is sung by all the world to the gratification of wise men's ears'. Previously you were set fast by your merits\u00b9 on the king's breast, like the Kaustubha jewel on Vi\u1e63\u1e47u's. But now you are one to be supported, like the moon by \u00c7iva, on his head.'\n\nEven while he spoke, the astrologers, approaching the king, said, 'Your majesty, the moment approaches: let the bridegroom proceed to the bridal house.' The king bidding him rise and go, Grahavarman entered the women's apartments, and, disregarding the thousands of glances that like opening blue lotuses fell upon him from women curious to see the bridegroom, passed on to the door of the bridal house, where he stayed his attendants and entered.\n\nThere amid a company of relatives, friends, and servants, mostly women, he espied his bride, whose face, hidden, like the morning twilight, by its roseate veil\u00b3, dulled the gleaming lamps by its radiance. Not too tightly embraced by womanhood, which seemed alarmed by her excessive delicacy, she appeared, by the long soft sighs which her bosom, choked with\n\n\u00b9 Or 'of Budha, the regent of Mercury and son of the moon, and Karna, the son of the sun.'\n\u00b2 Or 'cords.'\n\u00b3 There is a pun in aru\u1e47a, which also denotes the 'dawn.' The dawn also dims the lamps.\nfright, could scarcely utter, to bemoan her departing maidenhood. Trembling she stood motionless with bashfulness, as if fearing to fall, gazing with a quiver of terror in her mind at that lotus-red hand so soon to be grasped: so might Rohin\u012b gaze at the moon when near eclipse\\(^1\\). Her body was white with sandal, as though born of a (white) lotus bed whose amassed loveliness had been a gift from the moonlight. A fragrance of flowers breathed about her, as if she had come forth from the heart of spring. The perfume of her breath attracted the bee tribes, as if she were sprung from the Malaya breeze. Love followed in the train of one who seemed a reborn Rat\u012b. Compounded of all gem-like natures, brilliancy, loveliness, intoxication, fragrance and sweetness, the product of the Kaustubha jewel, the moon, wine, the tree of paradise, and ambrosia, she seemed a second \u00c7r\u012b formed by the ocean in his rage with gods and asuras\\(^2\\).\n\n[163] The soft light of an earring produced an ear-pendant of pearly rays like clusters of white Sindhuv\u0101ra flowers. Her cheek\u2019s surface, a glade all green with the emerald glow of her ear-ornament, formed a pleasance, as it were, for the fawnlike\\(^3\\) gleam of her eye; and thus she seemed to chide her shamefaced friends and heart, which, bewildered by the interesting spectacle of a bridegroom\\(^4\\), ever and anon essayed to raise a glance.\n\nNo sooner had that thief of hearts made his entrance than he was delivered over by his bride into the clutches of love. Most deftly he performed all that in the marriage hall the bridegroom is made to do by women with faces lit by a mocking smile. Then, his bride having been arrayed in the dress proper for the ceremony, he took her by the hand, and going forth, came to an altar whitened with new plaster and surrounded by invited kings, as when the slopes of Him\u0101laya were girt by mountains gathered to the wedding of \u00c7iva and\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Rohin\u012b \u2018the red one\u2019 gazes at the white moon when near eclipse. The nak\u1e63atras are the moon\u2019s wives.\n\n\\(^2\\) The first \u00c7r\u012b or Lak\u1e63m\u012b was produced by the ocean (always spoken of as rich in jewels) at the mythical churning along with the objects mentioned in this sentence.\n\n\\(^3\\) Or \u2018lovely.\u2019\n\n\\(^4\\) Or perhaps \u2018eager to see the bridegroom and the ceremony.\u2019\nP\u0101rvat\u012b. Gleaming around it were earthen dolls, whose hands bore auspicious fruits, and which had five-mouthed cups bristling with dew-besprent blades of barley and enemies, faces painted with soft colours\\(^1\\). Br\u0101hma\u1e47 witnesses busied themselves in kindling the flame, which smoked under logs heaped up by the teachers. Close to the fire unsoiled green Ku\u1e63a grass was set, and hard by were bundles of pounding stones, antelope skins, ghee, garlands\\(^2\\), and fuel, while a sparkle of parched grain was mixed with dark \u0120um\u012b leaves placed in new baskets. This altar the bridegroom ascended, as the moon with his beauty mounts the heavens. As the god of the flowery bow came with Rati to the red A\u1e63oka, so he drew near the fire with its tremulous sprays of red flame. The fire being fed,\\([164]\\) he marched round towards the right, attended by the very flames, which as if curious to see the bride\u2019s face took a rightward twist. And as the rice oblation was let fall, the blaze, whitened by the gleam of nails, seemed to smile\\(^3\\) in amazement at the bride and bridegroom\u2019s unprecedented grace of form.\n\nAnon a tempest of tear drops, clear as great pearls, showed itself in the bride\u2019s face, which yet displayed no discomposure, and, as if to quench the fire\u2019s image in her cheeks\u2019 clear oval, she burst into weeping. With eyes brimming with tears the women of the family raised a lugubrious cry. All the bridal rites being fully completed, the husband bowed with his wife to their parents, and then entered their chamber. About its portals were figured the spirits of Love and Joy. Bees going before like friends raised a hubbub. The charmed lamps, which lighted it, swayed in the wind of the bees\u2019 wings, as if trembling in fear of a blow from their ear-lotuses.

At the bed\u2019s head stood a night bowl of silver bedecked with lotuses, like the moon come to join company with the flowery god.\n\nThere, while the bashful young bride slept with her face averted, the bridegroom spent the night in gazing at her images in the mirrors of the jewelled walls, like family goddesses come in curiosity to hear their first words and seen through jewelled loopholes. Abiding in his new father\u2019s house, by his noble nature raining ambrosia as it were upon his new mother\u2019s heart, he spent ten blissful days, ever varying with continually renewed tokens of favour; and then, leaving regret like a palace porter behind, [165] and taking all men\u2019s hearts with him like provisions named in the dowry, he managed to secure his dismissal from the king and set out with his bride to his native country.\n\nHere ends the fourth chapter\u2014entitled The Exposition of The Emperor\u2019s Birth\u2014of the Har\u1e63a-Carita composed by \u010cri B\u0101na Bh\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6da.\nCHAPTER V.\n\n[166] As the inconstant lightning, having shown a splendour,\nlets fall the thunderbolt,\nFate after ordaining happiness to men superadds heart-\nrending affliction.\nAs Ananta, moving his coils, lays the mountains in\nruins, so does the one endless time by its revolu-\ntions\nLay great souls low in the dust, many together, re-\nspecting none.\n\nSubsequently the king one day summoned R\u0101jyavardhana,\nwhose age now fitted him for wearing armour, and, as a lion\ndespatches his whelp against the deer, placed him at the\nhead of an immense force and sent him attended by ancient\nadvisers and devoted feudatories towards the north to attack\nthe H\u016b\u1e47as\u00b9.\n\nFor several stages my lord Har\u1e63a followed his march with\nthe horse. When however his brother had entered the region\nwhich blazes with Kail\u0101sa\u2019s lustre, being at youth\u2019s adven-\nture-loving age, he spent several days away from camp on the\nskirts of the Him\u0101laya, where lions, \u00e7arabhas, tigers, and\nboars are plentiful, a fawn-eyed hunter with his bright form\ndappled by the radiant glances of love-smit\u00b2 wood-nymphs.\nHis bow drawn to the ear, he emitted a rain of shining shafts,\nwhich in a comparatively few days left the forests empty of\nwild creatures.\n\nOne day however at the fourth watch of the night\u00b3, dawn\n\n\u00b9 Cf. Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur. vol. ii. pp. 133, 134.\n\u00b2 Or perhaps \u2018anxious (for their prot\u00e9g\u00e9s).\u2019\n\u00b3 This is a sign of near fulfilment.\nbeing almost come, he saw in a vision a lion burning in an overpowering forest fire, which reddened the whole sky with a sea of flickering flame. [167] Into that same fire he saw the lioness, leaving her cubs, hurl herself with a plunge. At this the thought arose in his heart\u2014'Stronger of a truth than steel are the bonds whose tissue is love, when even brutes are drawn on by them to acts like this.' On awakening his left\u00b9 eye incessantly throbbed; a mysterious tremour overspread his frame; his heart started without cause from its internal moorings; for no reason at all a profound dejection came over him. What could it mean? Various conjectures wracked his mind, until losing all self-command he bowed his face in thought, so that the fixed pupils of his partridge eyes seemed to make the earth for an instant a bed of sprouting land-lotuses. A void as it were was in his heart during that day's sport, and, when the sun had ascended to mid-day, he returned home, where, lying on a bamboo couch stretched on the ground with a pillow white as moonshine and cool sandal unguent covering its frame, he remained with small hand-fans softly waving on either side, full of apprehension.\n\nAnon he beheld afar off a certain Kura\u1e45gaka approaching with a billet tied in a forehead-wrap of rags of deep indigo hue\u00b2. Weariness and heat had combined to give him such a blackness of body, that he seemed turning into charcoal through some inner fire of grief. Disguised as the dust excited by the quick trot of his hurried approach, the very earth appeared to pursue him out of curiosity to learn news of its king. Flapped by the opposing breeze, the long hem of his robe fanned both his flanks, just as if his rapid advance had given him wings. Impelled from behind by his master's charge, drawn on from the front by prolonged emissions of weary breath, the sun's image shaped in his oozing forehead seeming to snatch at the writing in eagerness to learn its import, his body empty of every sense, as if he had dropped them in his haste, he stumbled vacantly upon an even enough road, as\n\n\u00b9 The right would have foretold good news.\n\u00b2 The dark colour symbolizes the bad news.\nthough overweighted by the purport committed to the letter.\n\nOne might compare him to a fragment of a black cloud soon to let fall a thunderbolt of ill-news, a smoke whorl of a fire of sorrow soon to blaze, a seed of a paddy of sin soon to bear its harvest; a very courier of ill-omen.\n\nAt that sight Har\u1e63a\u2019s heart was cloven by a terror taking shape from the previous succession of evil omens. Approaching with a bow, Kura\u1e45gaka presented first the despondency seated in his looks and then the writing, which the prince took in his own hand and read. With its contents affliction penetrated to his soul, and, looking the picture of desolation\u00b9, he inquired what was his father\u2019s sickness. With eyes dropping tears and lips the faltering accents Kur-a\u1e45gaka made a two-fold answer \u2018It is, my lord, a violent fever.\u2019 At this news Har\u1e63a\u2019s heart was instantly splintered into a thousand pieces. Anxious for the preservation of his father\u2019s life, he rinsed his mouth and conveyed to Br\u0101hmans the whole of his regal equipage, jewels and gold and silver to a vast amount. Then without taking food he started up and calling to a youth who stood in his presence sword to forehead, ordered him to saddle his horse. The grooms having hastily run up to bring it, he mounted and set out alone with a tremour at his heart.\n\nStartled by the conch\u2019s sudden call to horse, the cavalry made ready in haste, and came galloping in, troop after troop, from every side, filling the abyss of heaven with the loud tramp of resonant hoofs. On the way deer, passing from right to left\u00b2, foreshadowed the approaching end of the lion king. Facing the sun\u2019s flaming circle, a crow on a burnt-out tree uttered its dreadful cry, as if to cleave the prince\u2019s heart. Straight against him came a naked Jain, bedecked with peacock\u2019s tail-feathers\u00b3, a fellow all lampblack as it seemed with\n\n\u00b9 Avagrahar\u016bpo. Kail\u0101\u00e7andra Datta\u2019s text reads avignar\u016bpo \u2018with confusion in his looks.\u2019 For the idea in avagrahar\u016bpo cf. c. vi. p. 202, ll. 9\u201311 (text).\n\n\u00b2 The opposite of the pradak\u1e63i\u1e47a or respectful order.

[169] This inauspicious celebration of his departure deepened the prince's apprehensions. His heart softening with filial love, surmising now this, now that; his eyes immovably fixed upon his horse's shoulder; followed in silence\u2014for all amusing talk was at an end\u2014by his royal escort; he in a single day accomplished a distance amounting to many days' journey. When the adorable sun, despondent as it seemed at the news of the king's sickness, bent downwards with waning splendour, he refused, despite the frequent admonitions of Bhan\u1e0di and the other affectionate nobles, to take food. Footmen being sent ahead to secure a relay of villagers to show the best way, he passed the night in the saddle.\n\nOn the morrow at noon he reached the capital, but its sounds of triumph were departed, sunk the booming of its drums, checked its minstrelsy, its festivity expelled. No troubadours sang, no merchandise was exposed for sale in the shops. Here and there gleamed the smoke whorls of the Ko\u1e6dihoma rite\u00b9, which, twisted by the force of the wind, resembled crumpled horns of Yama's buffalo ploughing up the place, or death's net lines encircling it. Overhead roamed flocks of crows, which, cawing harshly in the daytime, like the tinkle of iron bells adorning Yama's buffalo, announced the approach of calamity. Here loving kinsmen were keeping a fast to appease Ahibradhna\u00b2, lying before his image. There young nobles were burning themselves with lamps to propitiate the Mothers. In one place a Dravidian was ready to solicit the Vampire\u00b3 with the offering of a skull. In another an \u0100ndhra man was holding up his arms like a rampart\u2074 to conciliate C\u0101\u1e47\u1e0di. Elsewhere distressed young servants were pacifying Mah\u0101k\u0101la by holding melting gum on their heads. In another place a group of relatives was intent on an oblation of their own flesh, which they severed with keen knives. Else-\n\n\u00b9 An oblation to propitiate adverse planets.\n\u00b2 \u0120iva.

Thus the capital seemed polluted with the ashes of cemeteries, encircled by ill-omens, pillaged by fiends, swallowed up by the Kali age, hid beneath mounds of sin, sacked by the raids of demerit, victimized by the taunts\\(^1\\) of transience, appropriated by the mockeries of fate; vacant, wrapped in slumber, robbed, abashed, deluded, fallen in a swoon.\n\nNo sooner had he entered than in the bazaar street amid a great crowd of inquisitive children he observed an Inferno-showman\\(^2\\), in whose left hand was a painted canvas stretched out on a support of upright rods and showing the lord of the dead mounted on his dreadful buffalo. Wielding a reed-wand in his other hand, he was expounding the features of the next world, and could be heard to chant the following verse:\n\nMothers and fathers in thousands, in hundreds children and wives\nAge after age have passed away: whose are they, and whose art thou?\n\nWith this still further rending his heart Har\u1e63a arrived in due course at the palace door, now shut to all the world. Dismounting, he perceived a young physician named Su\u1e63ena coming out with a disquieted mien, like one reft of his senses. After receiving his salute the prince asked whether there was any improvement in his father's condition or not. 'Not at present,' was the reply, 'but there may be when he sees your\n\n\\(^1\\) The Kashmir text, however, and Kaila\u00e7c. read adhik\u0101ra\u012b\u1e25 ('rule') for dhikk\u0101ra\u012b\u1e25.\n\n\\(^2\\) Yamapattaka 'one who exhibits pictures of Hades.'

The Judge is enthroned and demon executioners bring the dead to receive their doom. The river of death flows on one side of the picture and those go safely across who hold a cow by the tail, while others are torn by terrible fishes. Chitragupt, the clerk or recording angel of Yama, considered to be the ancestor of the kayasth or clerkly caste, sits in an office with account books exactly like those of a Hindu tradesman, and according to the record of each soul, punishments or rewards are given...Duts or executioners torture offenders, while the blest sail upwards in air-borne chariots.'\nhighness.' So amid the salutations of the chamberlains he slowly entered the palace. There he found people bestowing all their goods in presents, worshipping the family gods, engaged in cooking the ambrosial posset\\(^1\\), performing the Six Oblation sacrifice\\(^2\\), offering tremulous Durv\u0101 leaves besmeared with clotted butter, chanting the Mah\u0101-M\u0101y\u016br\u012b hymn\\(^3\\), purifying the household, completing the rites for keeping out the spirits by offerings. Earnest Br\u0101hmans were occupied in muttering Vedic texts; [171] \u00c7iva's temple resounded with the murmur of the Hendecad\\(^4\\) to Rudra; \u00c7aivas of great holiness were bathing Vir\u016bp\u0101k\u1e63a's image with thousands of vessels of milk\\(^5\\). Seated in the courtyard were kings, distressed in mind at failing to obtain a sight of their sovereign: bathing, eating, and sleeping had become mere names to them, and their clothes were foul from neglect of the toilet, while they passed day and night motionless as though pictured, awaiting bulletins from the king's personal attendants who came bursting in from the inner apartments. On the terrace was a woe-begone group of less intimate servants, discussing the king's sad plight in whispers: here was one imagining errors on the part of the doctors, there one reading out descriptions of incurable diseases, one recounting bad dreams, one imparting stories of demons, one publishing communications from astrologers, one droning out portents; one again reflecting upon the transiency of things, chiding this mutable world, censuring the mockeries of the Kali age, and accusing fate; another indignant with dharma and reproaching the gods of the royal household; a third commiserating the lot of the afflicted young nobles.\n\nScanned by his father's servants with eyes that brimmed with fast flowing tears, the prince passed on into the third\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Of milk, ghee, and rice offered as a life-preservative to the gods.\n\n\\(^2\\) 'Praj\u0101pate sv\u0101h\u0101' iti \u015ban\u1e47\u0101\u1e41 devat\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 n\u0101ma grihi\u1e6dv\u0101 \u015ban\u1e47\u0101\u1e41 ev\u0101hutin\u0101m prak\u1e63ep\u0101\u1e25 \u015bad\u0101hutihoma ucyate.

Numerous lackeys thronged the vestibule; a triple veil hid the salon; the inner door was closed; the panels were forbidden to creak; closed windows kept out the draughts\\(^1\\). Anguished attendants, chamberlains furious at a tramp of footsteps on the stairs, all orders issued in noiseless signs. [172] Not quite near the king sat a man in armour; in a corner stood one bearing a gargling bowl, flurried by frequent summonses; in the Moon Chamber crouched the silent ministers of state; the screened balcony was occupied by women of the family distracted by profound grief; in the quadrangle a cluster of despondent servants. A few loving friends had been admitted. The physicians were in terror at the deep-seated ravages of the disease, the king\u2019s advisers sunk in dejection, the purohit stupefied; friends despaired, pandits were torpid\\(^2\\), faithful feudatories in agony; the chowrie-bearer had lost his wits, the bodyguard was emaciated with grief. The favourites saw the accomplishment of their wishes fade away; beloved princes, having out of loyal affection abandoned sustenance, fainted with loss of strength; young nobles were prostrate on the ground from night-long watching. Grief lay heavy on a group of heirs to ancient houses; the chamberlains were shrivelled up with sorrow; the court poets had laid aside their glee; confidential servants uttered despairing sighs; from the pale lips of the king\u2019s mistresses the betel stain had fled.\n\nThe head cook was intent on the preparation of the diet ordered by perplexed physicians. Attendants were drinking streams of water from uplifted cups\\(^3\\) in order to distract the pain of the king\u2019s dry mouth. Gourmands were being fed to relieve his craving. All the dealers were busy in providing a\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Or \u2018small apertures had been formed to secure ventilation,\u2019 as Kajl\u0101\u00e7andra Datta, which seems preferable.\n\n\\(^2\\) Kail\u0101\u00e7. reads \u2018vipr\u0101\u1e47a\u2019 \u2018half-dead\u2019 for nidr\u0101\u1e47a.

One might infer the sick man's fearful thirst from the incessant calls to the waterman. Butter-milk was freezing in pails packed in ice; a collyrium-stick had been cooled with camphor powder placed on a moist white cloth; in a new vessel besmeared with wet clay was whey for a gargle. Water trickled from soft bundles of fibres covered with delicate (red) lotus leaves; on the ground where were cups of drinking water lay bunches of blue lotuses with their stalks. Boiled water was being cooled by passing in a stream from cup to cup; red sugar diffused a pungent odour. On a stand stood a sand jar for the sick man's eyes\u00b9 to rest upon; fresh water-plants were coiled round a dripping globe; [173] a crystal platter gleamed with parched groats and barley-meal; a paste of flour and curds was held in a yellow emerald cup\u00b2; a collection of crystal, pearl, and shell vessels was sprinkled with powders and infusions of cooling herbs. Piles of myrobalans, citrons, grapes, and pomegranates were at hand. Lustral water was being scattered by fee'd Brahmans. A flat stone was stained with forehead unguents which a maidservant was pounding.\n\nThere he saw his sire preparing by a camp-lustration, as it were, of burning fever for the conquest of the next world. On a couch uneven\u00b3 from his restless movements he tossed like venom-tortured \u00c7e\u1e63a on the Milky Sea. Like the drying ocean of doomsday\u2074, he was white with a dust of pearl powder\u2075; but black death was uprooting him, as the black demon\u2076 uprooted Kail\u0101sa. As they touched him, the hands of the attendants engaged in ceaselessly smearing him with sandal were as white in the palm as if turned to ashes by contact with his burning limbs: while in the guise of the sandal\n\n\u00b9 For -\u0101ntaracak\u1e63u\u1e63i read -\u0101turacak\u1e63u\u1e63i with Kail\u0101\u1e63a.

Incessantly applied petals of red, white, and blue lotuses seemed to blot his body with the falling glances of death.\n\nOn his head a thick\\(^2\\) silken cloth bound round his hair told of never-ceasing shocks of pain, and, swollen with intolerable anguish, a network of dark veins stood out upon his forehead's page, a dreadful spectacle, as if death's finger were drawing lines to show the number of days ere the end. As if in horror at the sight of death's approach, the pupils of his eyes had retreated a little inwards. A stream of hot breath, rippled by waves of grey rays which issued from a line of dry teeth, suggested a river seen in a mirage. A tongue darkening, as if scorched by that burning breath, bespoke the convulsions of an appalling complication. On his breast lay gems, pearl-necklaces, sandal, and moonstones, as if he were making himself meet for the sight of death's emissaries. Tossing his arms in the contortions of his agony, he seemed seeking to cool the feverish heat with a shower bath formed of rays from the nails of his vibrating hands. Even his images, as they fell on the neighbouring liquids, jewelled floor, and concave mirrors, [174] seemed to bespeak the extremity of the heat\\(^3\\). A swoon, whose touch brought relief, he honoured like a wife in whom was all his trust. All about him, noted by the affrighted physicians, were symptoms of death, like the letters of Yama's summons. On the eve of the Great Journey, he was leaving to his kinsmen's hearts the inheritance of his pains, while, wedded as he was to soul-weariness, his bodily charm was as if in jealousy deserting him. Against him disease had concentrated its powers; emaciation let fly all her darts. Helplessness had taken him in hand: pain had made him its province, wasting its domain, lassitude its lair. Stung was he by dejection, appropriated by self-abandonment, enslaved by\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) *Sth\u0101smun\u0101* 'abiding' = (1) everlasting, (2) staying behind on earth.\n\n\\(^2\\) Kail\u0101\u00e7. reads *nibaddha*- 'bound about him' for *nivi\u1e0da*-\n\n\\(^3\\) I.e. by retreating into these cool objects.\nsickness, dandled by death, the target of the south\\(^1\\); quaffed by qualms, devoured by sleeplessness, swallowed by sallowness, gulped down by spasms; a captive to calamity, a prey to pains, a city sacked by torments; fate laid hands upon him, destiny descried him, transience sniffed upon him, nothingness overbore him; mortality had taken his measure\\(^2\\), affliction seized her advantage; distraction made him her dwelling; he was on the confines of doom, on the verge of the last gasp, at the outset of the Great Undertaking\\(^3\\), at the portal of the Long Sleep, on the tip of death's tongue; broken in utterance, unhinged in mind, tortured in body, waning in life, babbling in speech, ceaseless in sighs; vanquished by yawning, swayed by suffering, in the bondage of wracking pains.\n\nSeated by his side and touching him on head and breast was queen Ya\u00e7ovat\u012b, her eyes swollen with ceaseless weeping, her body grey with various medicinal powders, fanning him, though her hand grasped a chowrie, only with her sighs, and crying again and again 'My lord, are you asleep?'\n\nAt this spectacle the prince's mind, devastated by the first shock of grief, became apprehensive of destiny, and he deemed his father already a dweller in the realm of death. For a moment he was as it were divorced from consciousness. Discarded by firmness, tenanted by agitation, left empty of delight, mastered by despondency, he seemed to have a heart of fire within him. Stricken as it were by deadly poison, his swooning senses left him in a darkness beyond the gloom of hell, a vacancy exceeding that of space, and he was at a loss how to act. He brought his heart into contact with fear, and his head with the earth.\n\nAs soon as the king perceived his darling son while still at some distance, swayed even in that extremity by overpowering affection, he ran forward in spirit to meet him, and putting out his arms, half rose from the couch, calling to him 'Come to me, come to me.' When the prince hastily drew\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The region of the god of death.\n\n\\(^2\\) Kaila\u00e7c. reads parikalpitam for parikalitam.

Limb pressed to limb, cheek joined to cheek, closing eyes which flowed with incessant drops forming on their lashes, he held his son in a long embrace, forgetting all the torment of the fever. At length reluctantly released, the prince drew apart\\(^2\\) and bowed low; then, having greeted his mother, returned and sat down near the couch, where his father gazed upon him with eyes that seemed to drink him in with their fixed unblinking look. Again and again he touched him with trembling palms, and, speaking with some difficulty\u2014for his throat was dry through sickness,\u2014'My boy,' he said, 'you are thin.' Whereat Bha\u1e47\u1e0di explained that it was three days since the prince had taken food.\n\nAt this the king, after a long sigh, found strength to say in tear-choked accents:\u2014'I know, my boy, your filial love and exceeding tender heart. At times like this\\(^3\\) overmastering, all-afflicting family affection distracts even a sober man's mind. For this reason you must not give yourself over to sorrow.

Upon you my happiness, my sovereignty, my succession, and my life are set, and as mine, so those of all my people.

Not till you have eaten will I\nmyself take my diet.'\n\nAt these words the flame of sorrow blazed up still more\nfiercely in the prince's heart, as if to consume it. One short\nmoment he paused, and then being again charged by\nhis father to take food, he descended from the White House\nwith these thoughts in his mind:\u2014'This great crash has\ncome without warning, like a bolt from a cloudless sky.\nEven a common grief is a breathing death, a disease without\nantidote, a plunge into fire without being reduced to ashes, a\nliving abode in hell, a shower of coals without light, a sawing\nin twain without cleavage, a lancet's stroke that leaves no scar.\nWhat then of deeper afflictions? What shall I do now?'\n\nEscorted by one of the king's officers, he proceeded to his\nown apartments, where he partook of a few mouthfuls, mouth-\nfuls which, as if of smoke, evoked tears, as if of fire awoke a\nburning in his heart, as if of poison brought on swoons, as if\nof mortal sin aroused disgust, as if of alkali inflicted pain.\nWhile rinsing his mouth, he ordered his chowrie-bearer to\nfetch tidings of his father's state. Having gone and returned,\nthe man reported that the king still remained as before:\nwhereat the prince in distress of mind rejected the betel,\nand when the sun inclined to setting, summoned all the\nphysicians in private, and with a despairing heart inquired\nwhat steps under such circumstances should be taken. [177]\n'Your highness,' they answered, 'reassure yourself: in a very\nfew days your father will be reported restored to his proper\nself and pristine condition.'\n\nAmong their number, however, was a young doctor of\n\n---\n\n1 Kail\u0101\u1e63e. reads for svayam sukham 'with an easy mind.'\n2 Kail\u0101\u1e63e. reads punah punar 'again and again.'\n3 Mah\u0101pralayo om. Kail\u0101\u1e63e.\n4 Prak\u1e5biti, as the comm. observes, is an ominous word, implying\n'ante-natal state.'\nPunarvasu\u2019s race named Ras\u0101yana, a youth of about eighteen years of age, holding an hereditary position in the royal household, in which he had been cherished like a son by the king. He had mastered the \u0100yur Veda in all its eight divisions, and, being naturally of an acute intellect, was perfectly familiar with the diagnosis of diseases. He now stood silent and tearful with downcast looks. Being appealed to by the prince, \u2018Friend Ras\u0101yana, tell me the truth, if you see anything at all unpromising,\u2019 he replied \u2018To-morrow at dawn, your highness, I will state the facts of the case!\u2019\n\nAt that very instant the keeper of the palace lotus pools, comforting a ruddy-goose, chanted aloud an Aparavak\u1e6dr\u0101 couplet:\u2014\n\n\u2018Fortify, O bird, thy heart; freely abandon grief; pursue the path of discretion:\n\u2018With the beauty of the red-lotus pools the sun hies himself to Sumeru\u2019s peak.\u2019\n\nVersed in the omens of words, the prince on overhearing this relaxed his hopes for his father\u2019s longer life. The physicians gone, he lost all fortitude, and at nightfall went up again to his father\u2019s presence, where in anguish of heart he spent a sleepless night prolonged by grief, listening without cessation to his father\u2019s cries such as, \u2018The heat is terrible, bring pearl necklaces, Harin\u012b!\u2014place jewelled mirrors on my body, Vaideh\u012b!\u2014anoint my brows, Lil\u0101vat\u012b!, with bits of ice\u2014give me camphor powder, Dhaval\u0101k\u1e63i!\u2014apply a moonstone to my eye, K\u0101ntamat\u012b!\u2014set a blue lotus on my cheek, Kal\u0101vat\u012b!\u2014give me a rubbing with sandal, C\u0101rumat\u0101!\u2014[178] make a brisk\u00b2 breeze with a cloth, P\u0101\u1e6dalik\u0101!\u2014assuage the heat with lotuses, Indumat\u012b!\u2014refresh me with wet clothes, Madir\u0101vat\u012b!\u2014bring lotus fibres, M\u0101lat\u012b!\u2014wave a palm leaf, \u0100vantik\u0101!\u2014bind tight my whirling head\u00b3, Bandhumat\u012b!\u2014support my neck, Dh\u0101ranik\u0101!\u2014place an ice-cooled hand upon my bosom, Kur\u0101ngavat\u012b!\u2014shampoo my arms, Val\u0101hik\u0101!\u2014\n\n\u00b9 Yath\u0101vasthitam may however be masculine=\u2018the king\u2019s real condition\u2019: so Kail\u0101\u00e7c. trans.; in the comm. he gives prak\u1e5bitam.\n\n\u00b2 P\u0101\u1e6daya (Kail\u0101\u00e7c. pa\u1e6daya). pa\u1e6dum kuru \u2018make brisk.\u2019 Comm.\n\n\u00b3 Lit. \u2018imprison my runaway head.\u2019 Kail\u0101\u00e7c. notes a var. lec. b\u0101\u1e0dham\u0101nam.\nsqueeze my feet, Padm\u0101vat\u012b!\u2014clasp tight my body, Ana\u1e45ga-\nsen\u0101!\u2014what hour?

There in hot haste he\ndespatched express couriers and swift camel riders one after\nanother to procure his brother\u2019s coming. After washing his\n(tear-soiled) face he rejected the toilet appurtenances brought\nby the servants. Hearing from distracted young princes stand-\ning before him an indistinct murmur \u2018Ras\u0101yana, Ras\u0101yana,\u2019 he\nasked \u2018Well, friends, what of Ras\u0101yana?\u2019, whereat they all at\nonce became silent. Being further pressed, however, they\nwith sorrowful reluctance explained \u2018Your highness, he has\nentered fire.\u2019 The prince became (ashy) pale, as if scorched\nby an inner fire, and his grief-blinded heart, torn up by the\nroots, refused to be steadied. \u2018A noble man,\u2019 he thought,\n\u2018would rather not be than like an ordinary person utter\nunwelcome and distressing words. His generous nature,\nmaintained in trying circumstances, has like unadulterated\ngold acquired a greater brilliance by entering fire.\u2019 Again\nhe thought \u2018Rather was this to be expected of his love. Was\nnot my father his father, my mother his mother, we his\nbrothers? [179] Even when other masters are taken away,\na life retained is a cause of shame in the world: how much\nmore in the case of my auspiciously-named father, who was\nto his dependants ambrosia itself, a veritable kinsman, un-\nfailing in favours! In burning himself he has acted as the\ntime demanded. Nay, what does fire destroy of him who\nabides in glory steadfast to the world\u2019s end? He has but fallen\nin the flames; \u2019tis we who are burnt. Blessed indeed is he, a\nchief among the fortunate: but hapless this royal house,\ndeprived of such a noble youth. As for me, what exacting\ntask, what relic of duty, what preoccupation prevents this un-\nfeeling life from even now going its way? What hindrance\n\n1 The Kashmir text reads pr\u0101sth\u0101n\u012b\u1e63\u1e6dhur\u0101\u1e25, perhaps to be taken\nas one word, \u2018bent on departing\u2019: Kail\u0101c. has pr\u0101sth\u0101\u1e25 for pr\u0101\u1e47\u0101\u1e25.\nThe Comm.

Thus sorrow-stricken, he went not to the royal lodging, but disregarding every duty, threw himself upon a couch and remained wrapped in his shawl from head to foot.\n\nSuch being the prince's state and the king's condition remaining the same, the hands of the people seemed rivetted to their cheeks, streams of tears modelled upon their eyes, their looks fastened on the ends of the noses, sounds of wailing graven in their ears, lamentations a natural growth upon their tongues, sighs budding on their mouths, syllables of woe painted upon their lips, sorrows stored up in their hearts. Frighted, as it were, by the fire of scalding tears, sleep dwelt not in the hollows of their eyes: smiles vanished, as if dissipated by the wind of sighs: speech, as if consumed to nothingness by hot pain, went not forward. Even in tales no jests were heard: none knew whither musical parties had gone. Dances were as much forgotten as if they belonged to the past of previous births; even in dreams no finery was used. There was not even a rumour of pleasure: the very name of food was unspoken. Groups in taverns were like flowers in the sky\u00b9: troubadours' voices seemed conveyed to another world: recreation appeared to belong to a different cycle of existence. Again, it seemed, was K\u0101ma scorched by a fire, that of sorrow: even by day none left their couches. In slow succession too there appeared in the world portents many and great together on every side, betokening the fall of a lofty spirit and filling all creatures with apprehension of the king's death.\n\nThus:\u2014first the earth, heaving in all her circle of great hills\u00b2, moved as though she would go with her lord.

High in the heavenly spaces, apprehensive of the king's removal, appeared comets like braided locks with awful curls of far-extended flame\\(^1\\). Beneath a sky thus lowering with comets the world seemed grey, as with the smoke of a Long Life sacrifice commenced by the sky regents. In the sun's circle, now shorn of its radiance and lurid as a bowl of heated iron, some power, studious of the king's life, had presented a human offering in the guise of a horrid headless trunk. The lord of white effulgence, gleaming 'mid the round rim of his flaming halo, seemed to have raised a rampart of fire in alarm at R\u0101hu's greedily opening jaws. The quarters, won by the king's valour, glowed red as though they had in anticipation entered fire\\(^2\\). All crimsoned with flowing showers of bloody dew, the earth, his spouse, appeared to have shrouded herself in a gown of red cloth to die with him. The portals of the heavens were blocked with untimely masses of dark cloud, as though the regents, fearing the tumult of the monarch's death, had closed their iron door-panels. Loud grew the awful, heart-riving bursts of thunder-storms, crashing like the patter of drums that are beaten at the out-goings of the king of the dead. The sun's brilliance was dimmed by dust-showers brown as camel-hair, which started up, as it were, beneath the hoofs of Yama's approaching buffalo. Rows of jackals lifted high their muzzles in a discordant howl, like firebrands catching fire from flames that fell from the sky\\(^3\\). In the royal mansion the images of the family goddesses, [181] whose braided hair at its parting lines gave forth smoke in token of their distress\\(^4\\), seemed to be mani-\n\n---\n\n1 The quarters of the heavens are compared to wives fearing for their husband's death.

A swarm of bees, ranging feverishly about the Lion Throne, produced the illusion of K\u0101lar\u0101tri's\\(^2\\) tossing plaits of curling hair. Never for an instant ceased the croak of crows hovering above the women's quarter. From the centre of the white umbrella's circle an old vulture, screaming on high, tore with nimble beak a bit of a gem\u2014the kingdom's life as it were\u2014red as a piece of juicy meat.\n\nDistressed by these mighty signs, the prince could scarce live through that night. On the morrow a woman approached from the palace with such a tinkle of ornaments breaking in her hurried advance that she seemed a proclamation of the victory of dismay. The clash of her anklets, as they moved on her hurrying feet, set the craning hamsas of the palace cackling, as if from a (respectful) distance they were asking 'What? What?'; while in a blindness of tears she seemed to learn the way from tame cranes screeching in answer to the girdle, which as she stumbled rang upon her broad hips. Her forehead having been cut in collisions with unnoticed doors, a mass of blood like a red shawl's fringe covered her weeping face. Her cane, which she was casting away, looked like a stream from her golden bracelet, melted apparently by the heat of grief. Her fluttering shawl, waving in the wind of her breath, suggested a snake trailing its slough behind. Hanging over her sloping shoulders, tossed by the wind, and black as strips of Tam\u0101la bark, her hair covered her bosom in a dangling unbraided mass in keeping with her grief. As she incessantly waved her hand, which through the pain of beating her breasts was swollen and dark almost like copper in the palm, one might have thought it scorched through wiping away her hot tears. The people near her, imaged in her cheek, she seemed to bathe in her eyes' broken cascade, as if they were soon to enter the fire of sorrow. Under the quivering rays that issued from her restless eyes the very\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) In times of misfortune the hair of the family goddesses is supposed sometimes to smoke; the smoke is the dishevelled hair.\n\n\\(^2\\) A form of Durg\u0101: the name (K\u0101lar\u0101tri\u2014'Night of Doom') is used here by reason of its appropriateness.

[182] Welcomed by the people's despairing looks, she drew near, and letting both hands fall upon the mosaic, so that as she bent her head the rays from her teeth seemed to besprinkle her pallid lips in a falling shower, 'Help, help, my lord,' she cried; 'though her husband lives, the queen has taken a certain resolution.'\n\nAt the news of this further grief the prince, as if his strength of mind had given way, as if melted by sorrow, drained by thought, carried off his feet by pain, clasped by alarm to her bosom, lost all power of action. With returning consciousness, 'Callous that I am,' he thought, 'the assault of grief, oft as it falls upon my heart, yet like a hammer's stroke upon hard flint, evokes fire indeed, but reduces not my frame to ashes.' Rising, he went in haste to the women's apartments, where while still at a distance he heard cries like these from queens resolved to die:\u2014'Beloved Mango, take thought to yourself, your mother is seeking another home\u2014I am going, darling jasmine cluster, bid me farewell\u2014Without me, sister pomegranate by the house, you are now to be defenceless\u2014Forgive, red A\u00e7oka, my kicks and sins in plucking your sprays for ear-ornaments\u2014I see you, seraglio Vakula, wayward child as you are become through those mouthfuls of wine\u2014Clasp me tight, dear Priya\u00f1gu creeper; I am passing beyond your reach\u2014Friend Mango at the porch, you must render me the funeral libation of water, since you are my child\u2014See you forget me not, brother parrot in your cage!

Still wet from her recent bath, she resembled the holy \u0106r\u012b just risen from the ocean. Like the sky with its double twilight tints, she wore two saffron-brown robes. Enveloping her form, like a silken shawl, she wore the tokens of her unwidowed death, reddened by a tissue of light from lips stained with the deep dye of betel\u00b2. Hanging between her breasts was a red neck-cord, suggesting a stream of blood pouring from a broken heart. Her necklace, the thread of which was drawn aside by the hooked point of a cross-bent earring, seemed a halter of white silk compressing her throat. Her limbs being all aglow with moist saffron paste, she appeared to be swallowed in the pyre's devouring flames, while she filled the bosom of her robe with white tears like flower offerings to its blaze. At every step she scattered in dropping bracelets a kind of farewell present to the family goddesses. From her neck down to her instep hung wreaths of strung flowers, as if she were mounted on a death-swing with garlands for cords.\n\nAn ear-lotus resonant with bees humming within seemed to be saluting her lotus eyes.

Her hand carried a picture representing her husband, which she held as steadfast as her heart, where he dwelt, was fixed on death. Lovingly, like a pennon of wifely love, she clasped her lord's spear-haft, reverently tied with waving strings of white flowers. Before the king's umbrella, spotless as her life, she shed tears as to a kinsman.\n\nShe was giving instructions to her husband's ministers, who grasped them with difficulty, their eyes being stopped by torrents of tears that welled up as they fell at her feet. [184] Her ears caught the sound of wailing in the house, where a group of old kinsmen, grieving at their courteous dismissal, were adding to the clamour. The roars of the caged lions took her heart captive, resembling, as they did, her husband's utterance. Her nurse and her conjugal love had combined to beautify her: an old woman and swooning, familiar both, supported her: a friend and agony, comrades in adversity, embraced her: servants and pain were about her, clasping every limb: great princes and sighs attended her\\(^2\\): behind came aged chamberlains and heavy griefs. Even upon her husband's favourite hounds she cast a tearful eye: she fell at the feet even of rival queens: to even the painted figures she offered greeting: before even the domestic birds she clasped her hands: to the very brutes she said farewell: she embraced the very trees about the palace.\n\n'Mother,' cried the prince while still afar, his eyes filling with tears, 'do you also abandon hapless me? Be merciful and turn back,' and so in the act of speaking fell at her feet till his crest was almost lovingly kissed by the light of her jewelled anklets. As he lay there with his head touching her feet, her youngest and dearest son in such distraction of mind, the queen Ya\u00e7ovat\u00ee, propped up\\(^3\\) by a great frenzy of grief like a mountain, carried away into the Tartarean darkness of a swoon, overborne by the full tide of love\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Read pradak\u1e63inikriyaman\u0101m with Kail\u0101\u00e7.\n\n\\(^2\\) Read kulaputrair uchvasitai\u00e7ca with Kail\u0101\u00e7.\n\n\\(^3\\) Cf. Persius Sat. i. 78, 'Antiopa aerumnis cor luctificabile fulta.'\nrising in might like an outburst of accumulated tears long pent up, could not in spite of all her efforts check the torrent of her weeping. Her bosom heaved convulsively, betraying the resistless will of grief: her throat was choked distressfully with sobs: her lip quivered with exceeding agony, and her tightened nostrils repeated the tremor: closing her eyes, she deluged her clear cheeks with flowing rills of tears: then raising her face a little, she covered it with the hem of her shawl, wherein her shining nails showed forth in a row, like a spring of lucid tears welling up through the thin interstices. [185] Loud\\(^1\\) and long she wept like some mean woman, while with anguished heart and dripping breasts she recalled to mind from the day of his birth all the childish years when he lay in her bosom. Then\\(^2\\), as her thought recurred to home and kin, full oft she moaned, calling aloud upon her parents, 'Mother! father! look not upon me as a sinner that in my sore affliction I have set out for the other world': crying to her dear elder son far away, 'Alas darling! that I, all ill-fated, see you not': lamenting her daughter, now settled in her father-in-law's house, 'Defenceless are you now': reproaching fate, 'Merciless power, how have I offended?': inveighing in various ways against herself, 'No woman has had such an evil portion as I': suddenly reviling death, 'Remorseless one, thou hast stolen me away!'\n\nWhen this outburst of grief had died away, she lovingly raised her son, and with her hand wiped his streaming eyes, which, as if melting, seemed to flow only the more\\(^3\\) when the rays from her nails clustered in masses on his lashes. Her own eyes also she wiped, as, again and again refilling, they were distressed by a trickling succession of tiny drops, while their whiteness, swallowed up by a deep red, departed, their corners were swoln with scalding tears, and their lashes bestarred with pearls\\(^4\\) of lucid dew. Then she set behind her ear a curl, which, loosened by her distress, clave\n\n---\n\n1. Muktakan\u1e6dham 'uncontrollably.'\n2. Insert ca with Kail\u0101\u00e7c.\n3. Or simply 'in torrents.'

Daughter, spouse, mother of heroes, how otherwise could such a woman as I, whose price was valour, act? This hand has been clasped by even such a hero, thy father, a chief among princes, peer of Bharata, Bhagiratha, and N\u0101bh\u0101ga.

I cannot endure, like the widowed Rati\\(^1\\), to make unavailing lamentations for a burnt husband. Going before, like the dust of your father's feet, to announce his coming to the heavens, I shall be high esteemed of the hero-loving spouses of the gods. Nay, what will the smoke-bannered one\\(^2\\) burn of me, who am already on fire with the recent sight of his heart-rending pains? Not to die, but to live at such a time would be unfeeling. Compared with the flame of wisely sorrow, whose fuel is imperishable love, fire itself is chilly cold. How suits it to be parsimonious of a life light as a bit of rotten straw, when that life's lord, majestic as Kail\u0101sa, is passing away? Even should I live, yet after the mortal sin of slighting the king's death the joys, my son, of my son's rule will touch me not.

But the prince hastily drew them away, and bending down, held her in both his arms, and raised her prostrate form. Pondering the inevitableness of grief, deeming that act to be the better part befitting a lady of rank, recognizing her fixed resolution, he stood in silence with downcast looks.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) \u010cambhun\u0101 tu hate k\u0101me tatpatn\u012b ratisa\u00f1j\u00f1it\u0101 Mumoha purato dr\u012b\u1e63\u1e6dv\u0101 patim bhasm\u0101va\u00e7esitam || J\u0101tasa\u00f1j\u00f1\u0101 muh\u016brttena vilal\u0101pa ha citradh\u0101 Yadvil\u0101pad vane vipi samaduhkham abh\u016bt tad\u0101 ||.\n\nKail\u0101ce, from Skanda Pur\u0101\u1e47a.\n\n\\(^2\\) I.e. fire.\n\n\\(^3\\) There is a pun in bh\u016btil, which may also denote 'ashes.'\n\n\\(^4\\) Vi\u00e7vast\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 vidhav\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 Comm. cf. A.K.\nTrue is it that, even when made timorous by affection, a noble nature resigns itself to what accords with place and time. Having embraced her son and kissed his head, the queen went forth on foot from the women's quarter, and, though the heavens, filled with the citizens' lamentations, seemed to block her path, proceeded to the Sarasvati's banks. Then, having worshipped the fire with the blooming red lotus posies of a woman's timorous glances, she plunged into it, as the moon's form enters the adorable sun. The other, distracted at his mother's death, departed 'mid a throng of kinsmen to his father's side, and found him with his vital forces nearly spent, revolving his eyeballs as the declining lord of stars (the Moon) revolves his stars. Overcome with excess of intolerable grief, robbed by affection of all self-control, he clasped those lotus feet which had been fondled by the assembled crests of all proud kings; and uttering a cry, burst like a common man into a long fit of weeping, raining from clouded eyes a most pellucid stream of tears. It seemed as if an inner fire were melting his moonlike face, the light-texture of his teeth turning to water, the loveliness of his eyes oozing out, the ambrosia of his countenance trickling away.\n\nThe king, whose eyes were closing\u00b9, recovering consciousness as the sound of the prince's ceaseless weeping fell upon his ear, uttered in faint tones these words:\u2014\"You should not be so, my son. Men of your mould are not infirm of heart. Strength of soul is the people's mainstay, and second to it is royal blood. With you, the vanguard of the stout-hearted, the abode of all pre\u00ebminence, what has weakness to do? [188] To say you are the lamp of our line were almost depreciation of one whose brilliance compares with the god of day. To call you a lion among heroes is like a reproach to one whose prowess is seconded by penetrating insight\u00b2. To\n\n\u00b9 But the commentator explains uparudhyam\u0101nadr\u012b\u1e63\u1e6dir as 'having his consciousness impeded.' Kail\u0101\u00e7c. reads uparirudhyamana- 'eyes turned up.'\n\n\u00b2 If we keep \u00e7aurya (which Kail\u0101\u00e7c. omits), it will be 'heroism and penetrating insight.'\ndeclare this earth yours is almost a vain repetition, when your bodily marks proclaim an universal emperor's dignity. To bid you take to yourself glory is almost contradictory, when glory has herself adopted you. 'Succeed to this world' is a command too mean for an intending conqueror of both worlds. 'Appropriate my treasury' is a grant of little service to one whose sole craving is for the accumulation of fame spotless as moonlight. 'Make prize of the feudatory kings' is almost meaningless, when your virtues have made prize of all beings. 'Support the burden of royalty' is an injunction misbecoming one accustomed to support the burden of the three worlds. 'Protect the people' is but reiteration, when the sky has your long arm for its bar. 'Guard well your dependants' is an incidental duty to a peer of the world's Guardians. 'Practise yourself in arms,' to one whose forearm is blackened by the bow-string's callous brand how can this advice be given? 'Check levity' is an utterance without excuse towards one whose senses even in tender years were held in check. 'Annihilate your foes' is a suggestion of your own inborn valour.\" With these words on his lips the lion king closed his eyes never to open them more.\n\nIn that hour the sun too was reft of the brilliance which was his life. Ashamed as it were of his own sinfulness involved in the taking of the king's life, he now bent low his face. As if scorched within by a fire of sorrow for the monarch's decease, he assumed a coppery hue. Slowly, slowly he descended from the heavens, as if in compliance with earthly usage to pay a visit of condolence. As though to present an oblation of water to the king, he drew nigh to the western ocean. As soon as the water was presented, his thousand hands became red as if burnt in sorrow's flame. [189]\n\nWith radiance thus subdued, as if the mighty emperor's death had brought on a deep distaste for life and colour, the light-coroneted god entered the hollows of the mountain caves\\(^1\\). Cool grew his heat, as though moistened by the\n\n\\(^1\\) Like an ascetic.\ngathering storm of the people's tears. The world assumed a lurid tinge, as if from the colour of all humanity's tear-flushed eyes. The day grew black, as if scorched by the heat of countless people's burning sighs. From the day-lotuses their glory departed, as though it had started to follow the king. As the shadows passed on, the earth became dark as with grief for her lord\\(^1\\). Like the heirs of noble houses, anguished cakrav\u0101kas, abandoning their wives, resorted with piteous cries to the outskirts of the water\\(^2\\). Alarmed as it were at their widowhood, the lotuses hid their treasure chambers\\(^3\\). The red glow oozed away, like a bloody flow from the sky-queens' bursting hearts. In due course the lord of splendour had gone to the other world, leaving only the afterglow behind\\(^4\\). Like a banner of the dead, the twilight came all ruddy with a lurid expanse spreading far and wide over the heavens. Dusky streaks, like the lines of black chowrie ornaments upon a bier, were seen obstructing the view\\(^5\\). A night black in all its quarters was mysteriously built up, like a pyre with black beams of aloe wood\\(^6\\). With smiling faces the beauteous night lotuses adorned themselves in ivory-petalled buds and formed for themselves white garlands of wreathed filaments, like wives in readiness to follow their lord to death\\(^7\\).

The nobles seek the woods, the birds the water.\n\n\\(^3\\) The lotuses are compared to queens, who, alarmed by the breaking of the royal umbrella (implying the king's death), hide their treasures (ko\u00e7a=(1) buds, (2) treasures).

In the eastern quarter the moon appeared in sight, like the umbrella of Indra come forth to welcome the king on his journey along the heavens.\n\nAt that hour the feudatories and townsmen headed by the family priest, taking upon proffered shoulders [190] the bier of this \u00c7ivi-like\u00b9 king, bore him to the river Sarasvat\u012b, and there upon a pyre befitting an emperor solemnly consumed all but his glory in the flames. As for my lord Har\u1e63a, through all that night, terrible as Bh\u012bmarathi\u00b2, he sat with the princes sleepless on the un-cushioned ground, surrounded by all the connections of the royal household in a dumb sorrowing company like an universal assemblage of living beings; while his tears rained down like an outpouring of the flood of affection which, heated by sorrow's fire, flowed only within. In his heart he thought:\u2014'Now that my father is taken away, the world of the living has reached its goal: a chasm sunders the progress of mankind; the eldorados of desire are laid desolate, veiled are the portals of joy. Truthfulness is lulled to sleep, the people's livelihood is made a spoil, vanished is the love of heroism, sweet speech annihilated. Banished are all kinds of manly sports, ended is delight in battle, pleasure in the virtue of others is laid low, men of trust are an exhausted stock. No place is there for great feats, no profit in the \u00c7\u0101stras, no prop for the spirit of heroism, discernment is passed into a legend. Let men offer water\u00b3 to might, let the protection of the people go a begging, let chivalry bind her widow's braid, let sovereign glory flee to a hermitage\u2074, let\n\n\u00b9 \u00c7ivi gave up a part of his own flesh to save a pigeon from a hawk.\n\u00b2 Bh\u012bmarathi = 'the night of doomsday,' or 'that night in a man's life which follows upon 77 years, months, and days,' or, according to the commentator, 'a river in hell.'\n\u00b3 Sc. as at a funeral.\n\u2074 The words sam\u0101\u00e7rayatu r\u0101jya\u00e7r\u012br \u0101\u00e7ramapadam are, as Kail\u0101\u00e7. observes, ominous of R\u0101jya\u00e7r\u012b's fortunes, since they may also mean 'let R. flee to a hermitage.'\nthe earth array herself in two white robes\u00b9, let merriment wear a pair of bark dresses, let valour mortify herself in forest seclusions, let heroism put on rags. Whither now must gratitude go to seek him? Where again will the creator get such atoms for the construction of great spirits? The ten regions now find themselves empty of virtue, the world has become a darkness unlighted by duty, fruitless now is the birth of those who live by the sword. Without my father whence are to come those gatherings of heroes when throughout the day the cheeks of warriors bristle as stories go round full of the delight of famous fights? Would that even in a dream I might once more see his lotus face with its long red eyes\u00b2!\n\n[191] Even in another birth might I but clasp again those arms more massive than pillars of steel! Even in another world might I but hear his voice, deep as the roar of the churned Milk Ocean, calling me \u201cson\u201d in accents like a torrent of ambrosia.\u2019\n\nWhile the prince was engaged in these and other meditations, the night drew drearily enough to a close. Anon the cocks began to clamour wildly, as if in grief. The courtyard peacocks precipitated themselves from the tops of the trees on the garden mounts\u00b3. The birds, forsaking their homes, started forth for the forest. The gloom suddenly grew thin and swooned away. The lamps, as their oil\u2074 failed, inclined towards extinction. Robed in the bright red bark dress of the dawn, the sky seemed to have betaken itself to a mendicant\u2019s life. Like the fragments of the king\u2019s bones, the stars, all grey as a swallow\u2019s neck, were being gathered up by the appearance of morning\u2075. Droves of wild elephants, their humps covered with mountain minerals\u2076, had set out towards divers pools, rivers, and fords.

Gradually his light paled, as if through the smoke which spread from the king\u2019s flaming pyre; in his heart appeared a blackness as of a dark scar due to his burning sorrow for the king: chastened in mien as it were by the agony depicted in the moon-like\u00b2 faces of the departed monarch\u2019s whole harem, and distracted with yearning for his already vanished Rohin\u012b, he drew nigh to his setting. Like my lord the king\u00b3, the sun had mounted the heavens, and like the sovereignty, the course of night had changed.\n\nRoused by the appeals of groups of wise kings, like the lotus beds by awaking flamingos, my lord Har\u1e63a started up, and passed with eyes aflame out of the palace. In the women\u2019s apartments only a few sorrow-stricken chamberlains were left, and the domestic ha\u1e43sas were dumb and inert now that the tinkle of anklets had ceased. In the court\u2074 stood his father\u2019s servants, like a herd of wild elephants whose leader is fallen. Near his post the king\u2019s sorrowing elephant lay motionless and dull with his rider weeping on his back. [192] The royal steed occupied the stable yard, as might be known\u2075 from the lamentations of the marshal. In the empty audience chamber the clamorous cry of \u2018Victory\u2019 was still. Thus the prince passed on to the Sarasvat\u012b\u2019s bank, and having bathed in the river, offered water to his father. After the funeral bath, he stayed not to wring his hair, but having put on a pair of white silk robes, proceeded home full of sighs, umbrella-less, with none to clear his path, and, though a horse was led up, on foot: while his eyes, flushed like a red lotus and rivetted to the end of his nose, seemed vomiting forth his sorrow\u2019s flame for fear of burning his father, who now\n\n\u00b9 Or\u2014with the moon\u2014\u2018pale as a ball of pure white wax.\u2019 Kail\u0101\u00e7c. inserts carvavy\u0101m \u2018at night.\u2019\n\n\u00b2 Vidr\u0101\u1e47a, as before, = \u2018stupefied.\u2019 Pro\u1e63ita may perhaps go with purandhri, if on pp. 149 sqq. all the queens enter fire.\n\n\u00b3 Read r\u0101jan\u012bva (for r\u0101jat\u012bva) with Kail\u0101\u00e7c.\n\n\u2074 Kak\u1e63y\u0101 may also denote the elephant\u2019s girth cord: so Kail\u0101\u00e7c.\n\n\u2075 -kathite.

Some consigned themselves\\(^1\\) to precipices: some stationed themselves at holy fords in the neighbourhood. Some in agony of heart spread couches of grass, and quieted their great sorrow by abstinence from food: some, beside themselves with passionate grief, plunged like moths into the flame. Some, in whose hearts burnt a fire of fierce pain, took vows of silence and sought refuge on the mount of snows: some to cool their heat lay on couches of twigs along the Vindhya slopes, where wild elephants bedewed their bodies with a shower bath from their trunks. Some, indisposed for a courtier's life, abandoned the gratifications within their reach, and lived on a limited diet\\(^2\\) in vacant forest openings: some by feeding on air became emaciated\\(^3\\) hermits, rich only in virtue. Some assumed red robes and studied the system of Kapila in the mountains: some, tearing off their crest jewels, bound the ascetic's knot upon their heads, and made \u00c7iva their refuge: others [193] by enveloping themselves in trailing pale-red rags displayed the bright afterglow of their love. Others again reached old age in sylvan hermitages, where the deer licked their forms with the ends of their tongues\\(^4\\): others finally took vows, and roamed as shaven monks, bearing water in pots and in the\n\n---\n\n1 For babandhuh Kail\u0101\u00e7c. has babha\u00f1juh.

Wild with grief for his father, he turned away from all the avocations of life, regarding glory as a curse, the earth a mortal sin\\(^1\\), royalty a disease, pleasures serpents, home a hell, family ties a bondage, life an infamy, the body an infliction, health a blot, vigour a result of sin, food a poison, poison ambrosia, sandal a flame, love a saw, heartbreak a felicity. He was closely attended by young nobles of ancient houses, which had enjoyed the favour of the court for generations, venerable trusted advisers wearing an inherited dignity, old Br\u0101hmans versed in \u010cruti, Sm\u1e5biti and Itih\u0101sa\\(^2\\), anointed counsellors of royal rank endowed with learning, birth and character, approved ascetics well trained in the doctrine of the Self, sages\\(^3\\) indifferent to pain and pleasure, Ved\u0101ntists skilled in expounding the nothingness of the fleeting world, mythologists expert in allaying sorrow. Under their influence the prince was never allowed even in thought to follow\\(^4\\) the dictates of grief, and through their solicitations he gradually lost his distaste for food and the other dues of life. His thoughts recurring to his brother, thus he mused:\u2014\u201cPray heaven my brother, when he learns of our father\u2019s death, a type of the world\u2019s dissolution, may not after a bath of tears assume two robes of bark! or seek [194] a hermitage as a royal sage! or, manlion as he is, enter a mountain cave!

Never may indifference due to the transitoriness of things lead him to slight the advances of sovereign glory! All aflame with the fire of direful pain, may he have recourse to the coronation bath! Once arrived here may he not, when pressed by the kings, display a contrary mind! True, my noble brother was deeply devoted to his sire. He was for ever singing to me our father's praises, 'Think you, Har\u1e63a, that any man ever did or will possess such a stately frame, tall as a golden palm, such a great lotus of a face with its upturned looks abloom all day with ove for the sun's rays, such stave-like arms, bright as diamond pillars, such smiles mocking the grace of the lazy sot Haladhara?

This sorrow-stricken throng of people announces my dear lord\u2019s arrival,\u2019 and so with a tremour at his heart questioned one of them, a man of distinguished bearing, as he entered, \u2018Come, speak; is my noble brother arrived?\u2019 \u2018As your majesty says,\u2019 he slowly answered, \u2018he is at the door\u2019: whereat the prince, whose mind was softened with supreme sorrow added to\\(^3\\) brotherly affection, all but poured out his life along with a gushing torrent of tears.\n\nAnon, heralded by lamentations, which, uttered\\(^4\\) by the chamberlain, entered like servants in advance, the elder brother came in sight amid a throng of servants pale and worn with many days\u2019 neglect of bathing, eating and sleeping, and reduced in numbers by their long and rapid march. Only one or two, chiefly domestics, could be distinguished. The umbrella-bearer was wanting, the superintendent of the wardrobe lagged behind, the pitcher-carrier had collapsed, the spittoon-bearer was prostrate, the betel-bearer panted, and the sword-bearer limped. The prince\u2019s form was grey all over with the dust of the roads, as though his helpless heritage\\(^5\\), the earth, had made him her refuge. Long white bandages, bound about arrow-wounds received in battle while conquering the H\u016b\u1e47as, dotted his form like side-glances from his approaching royal glory. Limbs emaciated, as though for\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Prade\u00e7avrittit\u0101\u1e41 \u0101crayati \u2018declamatio fiebat.\u2019\n\n\\(^2\\) Kavirudite\u015bu = duhkodd\u012bpanak\u0101le\u015bu \u2018occasions for kindling grief afresh.\u2019\n\n\\(^3\\) Nihita lit. \u2018placed in\u2019: there is probably a pun, the fire of sorrow (manyu) being placed in the oil of affection.\n\n\\(^4\\) Or\u2014punningly with reference to the servants\u2014\u2018admitted.\u2019\n\n\\(^5\\) Kram\u0101gatay\u0101 contains a pun \u2018gathered on his way.\u2019\nthe preservation of the king's life he had offered their flesh in sorrow's fire, told of the heaviness\\(^1\\) of his grief. Upon his crestless head, with its hair miry and disordered and its jewel gone, he seemed to bear grief visibly enthroned. His forehead, lined by sweat oozing under the heat, appeared to weep with yearning to fall at his father's feet. With a broad river of tears he ceaselessly bedewed the earth, as though it had swooned on the death of its honoured lord. His grief-worn cheeks seemed channelled\\(^2\\) by the fall of that incessant stream of tears. [197] From his round lips the betel stain had faded away, as if they were melted through coming in the way of his burning breath\\(^3\\). Darkened by the rays of his sapphire ornament, of which only the amulet was left, the region of his ear seemed burnt by a great flame of sorrow at the recent news of his father's death. Though his beard showed but a faint growth, yet his face, being fringed with a tassel of rays from the dark pupils of his fixed downcast eyes, looked black with the long growth of mourning. He was as a lion distressed and left without a refuge by the fall of a great hill\\(^4\\), like the day turned into darkness and faded in splendour by the setting of the lord of light, like Nandana robbed of its shade by the crash of its tree of Paradise\\(^5\\), like a quarter of the heavens vacant through the exile of its sky elephant, like a mountain quivering and rent by a crushing thunderbolt\\(^6\\). Purchased by leanness, made a bondsman to misery, a domestic to despair, a disciple to the demands of grief, appropriated by affliction, dumb with taciturnity, pressed down by depression, all a sweat through hot pain,\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) There is an oxymoron in the antithesis between the emaciation of the limbs and the heaviness of the grief.\n\n\\(^2\\) 'And many a furrow on my grief-worn cheek Has been a channel for a flood of tears,' Moss.\n\n\\(^3\\) The commentator, who explains adharavimben\u0101pi as instrumental of circumstance, must have read this in place of adharavimbenopalak\u1e63itam.\n\n\\(^4\\) Or 'king.'\n\n\\(^5\\) Kalpap\u0101dap\u014d may also mean 'king,' and vich\u0101yam 'reft of splendour.'\n\n\\(^6\\) Or 'by the fall of a thunderbolt upon his sire.'\nculled by melancholy, looted by lamentation, adopted\\(^1\\) by apathy, renounced by presence of mind, disowned by discernment, repudiated by resolution, he was absorbed in a sorrow beyond the appeals of the counsels of age, the cure of good men\u2019s eloquence, the scope of sages\u2019 voices, the power of holy writ, the course of wisdom\u2019s efforts, the range of friendly offices, the sphere of sense delights, the province of gradual repair\\(^2\\).\n\nUplifted, as it were, on an agitated sea of stormy surging love\\(^3\\), Har\u1e63a rose excitedly to meet him. But his majesty R\u0101jyavardhana, on seeing him at a distance, felt inclined to let loose his long-stemmed torrent of tears. Extending his long stout arms, as if he would make an armful of all his sorrows, he clasped his brother\u2019s neck in abandonment of grief, and drawing him now to his own worn unshawled bosom, [198] now to his neck, now to his shoulder, now to his cheek, sobbed with such violence that their hearts were almost uprooted with their moorings. The king\u2019s favourite also, as his sovereign was recalled to his mind, responded like an echo with vehement sobs. It was long before the elder brother\u2019s tears ceased to flow, and, like the rain-god in autumn, he very gradually calmed himself. Then he sat down, and, water being brought by a servant, bathed his eyes, which seemed to derive the foam line of a great torrent from the massed light of the man\u2019s nails, and, often as they were wiped, were robbed of vision by drops of tears, which, forming at the end of their lashes, impeded their opening. Then with a piece of moonlight in the shape of a towel\\(^4\\) presented by the betel-bearer he wiped his face, which the hot tears had scorched. Having spent some time in utter silence, he rose and proceeded to the bath house. After a stay there he roughly wrung his unadorned locks of dishevelled and disordered hair; and with a lip which, as the remnant of its quivering emotion struggled as it were for existence, seemed to wish to\n\n---\n\n1 Read *vritam* \u2018chosen\u2019 for the sake of the alliteration.\n2 Perhaps we should read *k\u0101lakram\u0101pacay\u0101n\u0101m* \u2018gradual decrease.\u2019\n3 For the pun on *utkalik\u0101* \u2018agitation\u2019 and \u2018wave\u2019 cf. text p. 42 l. 9.\n4 Its whiteness and coolness are compared to moonlight.\nkiss even itself now glorified by the bath, with bathed eyes whose whiteness seemed to adore the sky regents with a dropping flower offering of white\\(^1\\) lotus petals opening to the autumn moon, he threw himself upon a couch placed on the courtyard terrace and having a cushion disposed beneath a low awning. There he remained without uttering a word.\n\nMy lord Har\u1e63a also bathed and reclined in silence by his side, stretched on a blanket laid upon the ground. Glancing ever and anon upon his afflicted elder brother, he felt his heart almost split into a thousand parts. For the sight of a brother is a rejuvenescence of sorrow. To the people that day was terrible even beyond the day of their king\u2019s death. Throughout the city none cooked, none bathed, none took their pleasure; in every quarter there was no man but wept. Not otherwise did the day pass by\\(^2\\).\n\n[199] At length, hued like flesh moistened by a great flow of blood\u2014as if he had just been shaped by Tw\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dri\u2019s axe\\(^3\\)\u2014the sun sank, red as madder, in the waters of the western sea. On the (red) lotus ponds the bee tribes buzzed in distress at the closing of the calixes. Anguished by the grief of their spouses at their approaching separation, a horizon of ruddy-geese fixed a tearful gaze upon their dear friend, the sun\u2019s orb\\(^4\\), now hued like a blooming Bandh\u016bka. Musical with bees, graced by kalaham\u1e63a beauties, the (night) lotus pools gave forth a sound like the plaited bells upon the jewelled girdle of the roaming \u010cr\u012b. In the firmament the rising clear-flecked moon shone like the pointed hump of \u010civa\u2019s tame bull, when blotted with mud scattered by his broad horns.\n\nAt that hour, being solicited by the chief feudatories, who approached with inoffensive\\(^5\\) admonitions, R\u0101jyavar-\n\n---\n\n1 Read vi\u1e63ada for vi\u1e63ada.\n2 Owing doubtless to the recurrence of divas\u0101\u1e25i this passage from \u2018Throughout\u2019 to \u2018pass by\u2019 is omitted by the Kashmir text.\n3 Tw\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dri was the artist of the gods. For the story cf. Wilson\u2019s Hindu Drama, vol. i. p. 363.\n4 The pairs of ruddy-geese spend the night on different sides of the river wailing to each other.\n5 Or perhaps \u2018not to be resisted.\u2019\ndhana reluctantly consented to take food. Dawn having appeared and all the kings being admitted, he addressed himself to Har\u1e63a, who was standing near, as follows:\u2014\"My dear brother, your situation invites instruction from your elders. Even as a boy you held fast to our father's habits of thought, as to the oriflamme of the virtuous\\(^1\\). Wherefore to one so tractable my heart, softened to compliance with the decrees of fate, has something to suggest. Do not revert to the gaucherie so easy to the nature of the young and so much at variance with affection. Do not like a dullard make opposition to my wish. You are surely not unacquainted with the universal practice. What did Purukutsa when M\u0101ndh\u0101\u1e6dri, the three worlds' protector, died? What Raghu on the death of Dilipa, whose brow governed the eighteen continents? What R\u0101ma on the death of Da\u00e7aratha, who in the great Asura battle mounted the chariot of the gods? What Bharata on the death of Du\u1e63yanta, to whom the confines of the four oceans were but a cow's puddle\\(^2\\)?\n\nEnough of these: [200] did not our father himself undertake the government on the decease of his auspiciously named sire, who by the pervading smoke of more than a hundred sacrifices turned the prime of Indra grey\\(^3\\)? Moreover the man whom grief subdues the learned term coward: for women are the province of sorrows. Still what am I to do? It is some native cowardice or womanishness which has rendered me subject to the flame of filial grief. My mountain\\(^4\\) being laid low, my tears are all set flowing like torrents. The great splendour sunk, the lamp of wisdom is vanished from my darkened prospect. My heart is on fire, and discernment, as if apprehensive of being itself scorched, visits it never even in sleep. All my manhood is melted like a thing of lac by a mighty flame of pain. At every word\\(^5\\) my mind faints like\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Or punningly 'a pennon with a cord.'\n\n\\(^2\\) For gospada cf. Hesiod 'Works and Days,' 489.\n\n\\(^3\\) A reference to the myth that Indra feared to be displaced by any one who should perform a hundred horse-sacrifices.\n\n\\(^4\\) Or 'king.'\n\n\\(^5\\) Or 'step.'\na deer smit with a poisoned shaft. Like a misanthrope, my memory roves in devious wanderings. My firmness has, like our mother, departed with our sire. Daily my sorrows increase, like moneys employed by an usurer. My body, as if laden with a cloud born of the smoke of sorrow's flame, rains down a pouring drizzle of tears. 'At death every man\\(^1\\) is dissolved into the five elements' is no true saying of the childish folk. Our father is become fire only, since he burns me so. The o'er-mastering rebel, grief, having penned this recreant heart of mine, burns it as the submarine fire the ocean, rends it as the thunderbolt the hill, attenuates it as waning the moon, and devours it as R\u0101hu devours the sun. My heart [201] cannot with mere tears dismiss the fall of so noble a spirit, stately as Sumeru. At sovereignty my eye grows disordered, like the partridge's at poison\\(^2\\). My mind seeks to avoid a glory, which, as if belonging to outcasts, is of no noble sort, banner-borne, crimson of hue\\(^3\\), turbaned with many shrouds of the dead. Like the house sparrow, I cannot endure to abide even a moment in a home which has become a hell\\(^4\\). I desire therefore in a hermitage to purge with the pure waters of pellucid streams that run from mountain tops this fond defilement which clings to my mind as to a garment. Therefore do you receive from my hands the cares of sovereignty, a gift not high esteemed indeed and reft of the joy of youth, like old age, which P\u016bru welcomed at his father's will\\(^5\\). Dismissing all the sports of youth, deliver your bosom like Vi\u1e63\u1e47u to the embraces of Glory\\(^6\\). I have abandoned the sword.\" So speaking, he took\n\n---\n\n1 *Pa\u00f1cajana* 'people of the five races,' cf. the *pa\u00f1ca jan\u0101\u1e25* of the Rig-V.\n\n2 The partridge's eye is said to 'grow red' (*viraktam* also 'disgusted') on seeing poison. See Kull\u016bka, Manu, vii. 217.\n\n3 The Sanskrit words may here mean 'of no Aryan lineage, outcast from pure birth, polluting assemblies'; or perhaps 'destined to be borne on the poles of outcasts.'\n\n4 Or 'a burnt habitation.'\n\n5 Yay\u0101ti, being afflicted by Indra with the curse of old age, prevailed upon his son P\u016bru to take the affliction upon himself.\n\n6 The allusion is to the youthful sports of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a with the shepherdesses before Lak\u1e63m\u012b became his wife.\nhis scimitar from the hand of his sword-bearer and flung it on the earth.\n\nAt this speech Har\u1e63a\u2019s heart was cloven as with the stroke of a sharp-pointed spear, and he reflected: \u201cCan my lord have been angered when away from me by a hint received from some envious wretch? Or is he seeking in this way to try me? Or is this a mental aberration born of grief? Is this perchance not my dear brother, or has he possibly said one thing and my sorrow-vacant sense apprehended another? Did he intend one thing while another escaped his lips? Is this a stratagem of fate for the downfall and ruin of our whole house, [202] an intimation of the failure of all the garnered merit of my deeds, or a freak of a whole horizon of disastrous stars? Or is it a pleasantry of the Kali age, heedless of my sire\u2019s death, that this man has, like the vilest of mankind, instigated me, as one ready for any deed, to this atrocious act, as if I were no child of Pu\u1e63pabh\u016bti\u2019s line, no son of our sire, no younger brother of his own, void of affection and detected in fault? \u2019Tis like bidding a divine drink wine, a faithful servant outrage his master, a good man have dealings with the low, a chaste wife forget her honour. Thus much indeed is seemly, that on the death of so noble a sire,\u2014a Mandara for churning like an ocean the whole ring of feudatories drunk with the intoxication of valorous frenzy,\u2014a man should seek a hermitage, don the bark dress, and practise austerities. But as for this charge of sovereignty, it is like a rain of cinders on a drought-parched wilderness, scorching one already scorched. This is unworthy of my lord. Again, although in this world a prince without pride, a Br\u0101hma\u1e47a without greed, a saint without anger, an ape without tricks, a poet without envy, a trader without knavery, a fond husband without jealousy, a good man free from poverty, a rich man without harshness, a poor man not an eyesore, a hunter without cruelty, a mendicant with a Br\u0101hma\u1e47a\u2019s learning\u00b9, a contented servant, a grateful dicer, a wandering ascetic without gluttony, a\n\n\u00b9 Or perhaps \u2018an orthodox Br\u0101hma\u1e47a.\u2019\nmisanthrope with a soft tongue\\(^1\\), a truthful minister, and a king's son without vice are all equally hard to find, yet my lord himself has been my instructor. Who, I wonder, with such a father, a very scent-elephant among kings, fallen, with such a royal elder brother going in his young manhood to a hermitage, abandoning his throne, and rendering sterile his great pillar-like thighs and arms, could desire the clod called earth, defiled by the tears of all men's eyes, or, even were he an outcast, could court that bawd of the deeds of warrior families entitled Glory, whose low character is betrayed by the tokens of the distorted features of all the vile parasites who hang about the drunken game of wealth? How did such a deeply degrading thought enter my lord's imagination? [203] What is this blemish observed in me? Has Sumitra's son\\(^2\\) faded from his mind? Have Vrikodara and others been forgotten? Not thus heedless of those who love him, thus singly fixed upon achieving his own ends, used my lord's high pre\u00ebminence to be. Again, my lord being gone to a hermitage, who indeed could so long for life as even to entertain a thought of the earth? The lion has a countenance all glorious with a handsome mane clotted with the ichor from the heads of mad elephants which his paw, terribly arrayed with claws sharp as the points of a thunderbolt, has felled: but when he has gone forth to take his pleasure in the forest, who is left to guard his dwelling in the mountain cave? for a hero's ally is his prowess. Why is my lord thus considerate to the jilt glory as not to lead her disguised as old age, like a woodland fawn, to that same hermitage, with rags to hide her bosom, and laden with bundles of Ku\u00e7a grass, flowers, fuel, and leaves\\(^3\\)?\n\nBut what avail these vain and manifold reasonings? in silence\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The Comm. gopyo-d\u0101sak\u0101 points to the reading of the Kashmir text, which omits parivr\u0101\u1e0d abubhuk\u1e63u\u1e25 and has gopya\u1e25 in place of nri\u00e7amsa\u1e25.\n\n\\(^2\\) Alluding to the far-famed younger brothers of the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a and Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, Laksmana and Bh\u012bma.\n\n\\(^3\\) I.e. 'Why not wait till you are old?' It was not unusual for Hindu kings to retire in old age to hermitages.\nwill I follow in his train. And the sin involved in transgressing my elder's commands austerity in fine shall dispel in a hermitage.\" So reflecting, he stood silent and downcast, in spirit gone first to the hermitage.\n\nBy this the weeping Keeper of the Robes had provided bark dresses, as previously ordered. The women of the royal household were screaming, as if their hearts\\(^1\\) had left them in alarm at the heavy strokes which their hands dealt (upon their breasts). Br\u0101hmans with uplifted arms were wailing aloud in horror\\(^2\\). With doleful cries a group of citizens were engaged in bending before the princes' feet. Ancient courtiers ran away with tumult in their hearts. Aged kinsmen leaning on servants entered with trembling forms, disordered apparel, grief-choked voices, streaming eyes, and hearts bent on remonstrance. Despondent feudatories sighed, as prostrate they marked the jewelled mosaic with their nails. All the people had started with their children and aged to forest seclusions.\n\nSuddenly a distinguished servant of R\u0101jya\u00e7r\u012b,\\([204]\\) Samv\u0101daka by name, entered with flowing tears in a bewilderment of grief. Uttering a cry, he precipitated himself into the audience. Thunderstruck at this, R\u0101jyavardhana and his brother questioned him with their own lips: \"Speak, friend! speak; what stroke more unnerving than the present is fate, triumphant at the king's death, bringing upon us, in pursuance of her resolve to increase her efforts for our ruin?\" \"My lord,\" the man with an effort replied, \"it is the way of the vile, like fiends, to strike where they find an opening. So, on the very day on which the king's death was rumoured, his majesty Grahavarman was by the wicked lord of M\u0101lwa cut off from the living along with his noble deeds. R\u0101jya\u00e7r\u012b also, the princess, has been confined like a brigand's wife with a pair of iron fetters kissing her feet, and cast into prison at K\u0101nyakubja. There is moreover a report that the villain, deeming the army leaderless, purposes to invade and seize this country as well. Such are my tidings: the matter is now in the king's hands.\"\n\n\\(^1\\) I.e. senses.  \n\\(^2\\) Abrahmanyam.\nInstantly at the news of such a fresh, sudden, unexpected, unimagined disaster the overwhelming passion of sorrow, rooted as it was, vanished from a heart previously unacquainted even by hearsay with humiliation, naturally impatient of checks from outside, filled with the pride of early manhood, claiming a birth from a heroic line, and devoted to a sister now suddenly an object of compassion. An awful paroxysm of wrath leapt fiercely into the recesses of R\u0101jyavardhana\u2019s heart, like a lion into his cavernous abode. On his broad brow a deadly frown broke forth, darkening like Yama\u2019s sister\u00b9 and like her wavy with wrinkled lines that writhed like K\u0101liya\u2019s brood in their fright at Kegiin\u2019s destroyer\u00b2. His left hand, proudly stroking his right shoulder\u00b3, huge as a sky-elephant\u2019s frontal hump, rained down upon it a torrent of rays from its own nails, as if to consecrate it for the enterprise of battle toils. [205] His right, whose palm filled with oozing sweat\u2014just as though he had seized the M\u0101lwa\u2019s hair to tear him up by the roots\u2014and which trembled as if with yearning to grasp wanton glory\u2019s tresses, glided once more toward his terrible sword. On his cheeks appeared an angry flush, as if Sovereignty, delighted by his taking up arms, were celebrating an ovation by scattered vermilion powder\u2074. His upturned right foot climbed his left thigh, as if, all kings being in his presence, it were filled with the pride of trampling upon their array of diadems. Imprinted on the jewelled mosaic, his left foot through the desperate twitching of his toes spat out a smoke, as though he would spout a flame to leave the earth widowed of men. His fresh wounds, bursting in his fierceness, spurted a bloody dew, as if to awake his valour sent by the poison of sorrow to sleep.\n\nThus he addressed his younger brother: \u201cThis task, my noble brother, is my royal house, this my kin, my court, my land, my\n\n\u00b9 The river Yamun\u0101.\n\u00b2 I.e. Kri\u015b\u1e47a, see Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur. v. 16.\n\u00b3 The Comm. takes ko\u1e63\u1e6da as an oath at an ordeal; but it seems here used as an expletive, cf. b\u0101huda\u1e47\u1e0da.\n\u2074 The people sprinkle red powder on one another at the Holi festival and at other rejoicings, cf. Kath\u0101s. 18. 122.\npeople guarded by their king's club-like arm: this day I go to lay the royal house of M\u0101lwa low in ruin. The repression of this beyond measure unmannerly foe\u2014this and no other is my assumption of the bark dress, my austerities, my stratagem for dispelling sorrow. M\u0101lwas to maltreat the race of Pu\u1e63pabh\u016bti!\u2014this is the hind clutching the lion's mane, the frog slapping the cobra, the calf taking the tiger captive, the water-serpent grasping Garu\u1e0da by the throat, the log bidding burn the fire, the darkness hiding the sun! My pain has vanished before a more vehement passion. Let all the kings and elephants stay with you. Only Bha\u1e47\u1e0di here must follow me with some ten thousand horse.\" So speaking, he ordered the marching drum instantly to sound.\n\nHearing this command, my lord Har\u1e63a, inflamed as he was with a fit of anger at the tidings of his sister's and brother-in-law's fate, felt his loving agony grow, as it were, to a greater height at the order to remain behind. [206] Speaking out, \"What harm,\" he asked, \"does my lord see in my attending him? If I am regarded as a boy, then I should all the more not be abandoned: if as needing protection, the cage of your arms is an asylum; if incompetent, where have I been tried? if in want of fostering care, separation makes thin; if unequal to hardships, I am classed as a woman; if you would have me happy, happiness marches in your train; if you think the toil of the journey great, absence is harder to support; if you would have me watch over my wife, Glory resides in your steel; if you wish me to guard your rear, valour is your rear-guard; if you argue that the feudatories are uncontrolled, they are secured by the bonds of your virtues; if you say a great man must not carry a companion with him, then you count me as distinct from yourself; if you say you are marching with a very light train, what excessive weight is there in the dust of your feet? if you think it inopportune that two should go, gratify me with the commission; if you say brotherly affection is timid, the fault is mutual. Whence this your arm's excessive greedy-\n\n1 Sc. such as I.\nness that you desire alone to quaff the ambrosia of fame as white as a mass of the Milk Ocean\u2019s foam? Never before have I been stinted in your favours. Therefore let my lord be gracious and take me also.\u201d\n\nSo speaking, he sank his head to the ground and fell at his brother\u2019s feet. But the elder upraised him and said:\u2014\n\n\u201cWhy thus, dear brother, by putting forth too great an effort add importance to a foe too slight for our power? A concourse of lions in the matter of a deer is too degrading. How many flames gird on their armour against a sheaf of grass? Moreover for the province of your prowess you have already the earth with her amulet wreath of eighteen continents. The winds that carry off ranges of great hills arm not against a trembling cotton yield. The sky elephants, audaciously familiar with Sumeru\u2019s flanks, butt not upon a tiny ant-hill. For a world-wide conquest you, like M\u0101ndh\u0101tri, shall grasp, in the shape of your bow with its curving frame adorned with bright gold leaf, a comet portending the world\u2019s end of all earthly kings. [207] Only, in the unbearable hunger which has been aroused in me for our enemies\u2019 death, forgive this one unshared morsel of wrath. Be pleased to stay.\u201d Such was his answer, and on the same day he set out to seek the foe.\n\nMy lord Har\u1e63a\u2019s brother being thus occupied, his father laid to rest, his brother-in-law banished from life, his mother dead and his sister a prisoner, he could scarcely make the time pass, alone as he was like a wild elephant strayed from the herd. Many days having elapsed, on one occasion as with the night two-thirds spent he lay awake, being still despondent at his brother\u2019s departure, he heard the watchman chanting an \u0100ry\u0101 couplet:\u2014\n\n\u2018Though his virtues\u00b9 be sung by continents, though rich be his worth like a treasure of jewels\u00b2,\n\u2018As a squall a ship, so does fate overwhelm a hero without warning.\u2019\n\n\u00b9 Or\u2014of the ship\u2014\u2018cables.\u2019\n\u00b2 Or\u2014of the ship\u2014\u2018though it have amassed the prime of the ocean\u2019s treasures.\u2019\nAt this his heart was still further grieved by thoughts of the instability of things; but when the night was well-nigh ended, he obtained a moment's sleep, and in a vision saw a heaven-kissing pillar of iron broken in pieces. With a throbbing heart he awoke again, and reflected:\u2014\"Why do these evil dreams thus incessantly pursue me? Day and night my eye\u2014and not the right one\u2014throbs expert in prophecies of evil. Dire portents again never for a moment weary of announcing the death of no mean king. Day after day R\u0101hu, hard by the sun's disc which shows a headless trunk, is seen to wear a bodily form no longer curtailed\\(^1\\). The Seven Sages vomit eruptions of smoke, swallowed perhaps in their time of austerity, and cover all the planets with grey. Every day dire flames are seen in the heavens, and the star groups fall from the firmament like motes of ash from the burning. The dimmed moon seems to sorrow for the downfall of the stars. Each night, as the meteors flash hither and thither, the heavens with tremulous starry eyes gaze as it were upon a mighty conflict of planets in the abyssm. [208] Whistling with bits of gravel and permeated by huge flying dust clouds, the wind seems transporting the earth somewhither to signify the transmission of sovereignty. I see no fair auspice in the hour. Who shall waylay this fatality in our stock, which wastes its tender growth as an elephant a bamboo? Be it well, in any case, with my lord.\"\n\nAfter such thoughts as these he found a difficulty in encouraging his heart, which seemed in coward flight\\(^2\\) from an outburst of brotherly affection in its midst. Then rising, he went through the usual round of duties.\n\nWhen in the audience chamber, he saw Kuntala, a chief officer of cavalry and a great noble high in R\u0101jyavardhana's\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The trunk seen in the sun seems to provide R\u0101hu, an eclipse demon who is all head, with a body. Var\u0101hamihira (iii.) says, 'if a staff is seen in the sun, the sovereign will die; if something in the shape of a headless trunk, there will be danger from sickness.'\n\n\\(^2\\) 'Dravad' may be taken in the sense of melting, 'his heart moist with an oil of brotherly affection bursting forth within.' The Kashmir text reads antarbhinnam.\nfavour, hastily enter with a dejected company entering in his train. His form was wrapped in a shawl as miry as if unbearable grief had reddened\\(^1\\) its texture with a smoke of hot sighs. His looks were downcast, as if through shame at the preservation of his life, his glance fixed on the end of his nose, and his face, hairy with the long growth of mourning, mutely with uninterrupted tears bespoke his master's fall. This sight aroused the prince's alarm, but when the time came to hear the dreadful calamity, he seemed seized in every limb by all the world powers at once, water in his eyes, sighs in his moon-like mouth, fire in his heart, earth upon his breast. From the man he learnt that his brother, though he had routed the M\u0101lwa army with ridiculous ease, had been allured to confidence by false civilities on the part of the King of Gau\u1e0da, and then weaponless, confiding, and alone, despatched in his own quarters.\n\nInstantly on hearing this his fiery spirit blazed forth in a storm of sorrow augmented by flaming flashes of furious wrath. His aspect became terrific in the extreme. As he fiercely shook his head, the loosened jewels from his crest looked like live coals of the angry fire which he vomited forth. Quivering without cessation, his wrathful curling lip seemed to drink the lives of all kings. [209] His reddening eyes with their rolling gleam put forth as it were conflagrations in the heavenly spaces. Even the fire of anger, as though itself burned by the scorching power of his inborn valour's unbearable heat, spread over him\\(^2\\) a rainy shower of sweat. His very limbs trembled as if in affright at such unexampled fury. Like \u00c7iva, he put on a Shape of Terror: like Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, he displayed a Man-lion's aspect: like the sun-crystal hill, he fired at the sight of another's fierce brilliance\\(^3\\): like doomsday, his form overpowered the eye by the brilliance of twelve suns uprisen: like a world-alarming hurricane, he brought a tremour upon all monarchs\\(^4\\): like the Vindhya,\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Mud is often described as 'red.'\n\n\\(^2\\) Sc. the fire, as if in fear of a hotter fire, scatters water around.\n\n\\(^3\\) Or 'a second source of light.'\n\n\\(^4\\) Or 'mountains.'\nhe grew in sublimity of form\u00b9: like a great serpent, he was wroth at the insult of a vile king\u00b2: like Janamejaya, intent upon burning all sovereigns\u00b3: like V\u1e5bikodara, athirst for his enemy\u2019s blood: like the gods\u2019 elephant, in full career to repel his foes\u2074. He represented the first revelation of valour, the frenzy of insolence, the delirium of pride, the youthful avatar of fury, the supreme effort of hauteur, the new age of manhood\u2019s fire, the regal consecration of warlike passion, the camp-lustration day of resentment.\n\n\u201cExcept the Gau\u1e0da king,\u201d he cried \u201cwhat man would by such a murder, abhorred of all the world, lay such a great soul low, as Agni\u2019s progeny did Dro\u1e47a\u2075, in the very moment when, having by his arm\u2019s undissembling valour subdued all princes, he had laid the sword aside? [210] Apart from that ignoble wretch, in whose minds would my lord\u2019s heroic qualities, alighting like flamingoes upon the lakes, find no favour, spotless both as a mass of Ganges foam, and recalling the memory of Para\u1e47u-R\u0101ma\u2019s prowess\u2076? How could he, furious as the summer sun, which dries the water of the lotus pools, put forth his hands, regardless of friendly advances\u2077, to take my lord\u2019s life? What shall be his doom? Into what creature\u2019s womb shall he pass? Into what hell shall he fall? What outcast even would wreak this deed? My tongue seems soiled with a smireh of sin as I take the miscreant\u2019s very name upon my lips. With what design did\n\n\u00b9 Mbh. iii. 8781 (104).

Truly now the fool, when in greed for the taste of sweet savours he laid hands upon my lord\u2019s life as honey, saw not the coming onset of a swarm of arrows\u00b2. By lighting up this evil path\u00b3 this vilest of Gaudas has collected only foul shame, like lampblack, to the soiling of his own house. Though the sun, crest jewel of the world, may be sunk in the west, is there not the moon, lion lord of the one deer that roams\u2074 the planet thickets, ready at once by the creator\u2019s appointment to quell the darkling foe of the road of right? Even when the goad, discipline\u2019s lawgiver, is broken, there exists for a wicked elephant\u2019s admonition the lion\u2019s still sharper claw, skilled to cleave the thick-boned heads of all mad elephants. Who is not bound to punish such vile jewellers, as it were, who deface the most brilliant gems? What now will be the wretch\u2019s fate?\u201d\n\n[211] Even as he thus spoke, the sen\u0101pati, Simhan\u0101da, a friend of his father also, was seated in his presence, a man foremost in every fight, in person yellow as a hill of orpiment, stately as a great full-grown S\u0101l tree\u2019s stem\u2075, and tall as if ripened by valour\u2019s exceeding heat. He was far advanced in years: and, although he had oft risen from repose upon a couch of arrows, yet in point of vigorous age he seemed to scoff at Bh\u012b\u1e63ma. So stubborn was his frame, that even old age laid but a trembling hand, timidly as it were, upon his stiff hair. He seemed while still alive to have been born anew into a lion\u2019s nature, compounded of guileless valour and having for a mane his straight locks white as a bunch of moonlight. His eyes were veiled by brows whose\n\n\u00b9 With reference to the worm vigataghrinena will mean \u2018relieved from the heat.\u2019\n\u00b2 Or \u2018bees.\u2019\n\u00b3 Or punningly \u2018lamp at a loophole.\u2019\n\u2074 Or by paronomasia \u2018dims\u2019: v. vi\u1e63e\u1e63a\u1e47a karana\u1e43 vih\u0101ro vich\u0101yika-ra\u1e47am gamanam ca Comm.

His terrible visage, brightened by a thick white moustache which hid his cheeks, seemed to pour forth an untimely war time\\(^1\\) in the shape of a commencing autumn white with blooming K\u0101ra groves. A beard hanging down to his navel played the part of a white chowrie, fanning his master, who though dead survived in his heart. In spite of age his broad chest was rough with great gashes of wounds opening their lips as if athirst to drink the water of whetted steel's edge: and all across it ran in lines the writings of many great scars graven by the axe edge of sharp swords, as though he were making a calculation of the hour of victory in every battle; whence he might be likened to an eastern range of hills in motion\\(^2\\). In the charm of divers martial exploits he seemed to outstrip the very Mah\u0101-Bh\u0101rata; in an unbroken career of slaughtering foes to give a lesson to Para\u00e7u-R\u0101ma himself: in ranging oceans\\(^3\\) and in energy devoted to winning glory perforce to throw even Mandara into the shade: [212] in adapting himself to the limitations of his position\\(^4\\) to surpass the very sea: in steadfastness, rigidity and elevation to shame even the hills: in circumambient effulgence of fierce native brilliance to set the sun himself at nought: in the wearing toil\\(^5\\) of supporting his lord's weighty concerns to laugh even \u00c7iva's bull to scorn. Of fury's fire he\n\n---\n\n1 There is perhaps a pun here, as the Sanskrit might mean 'an untimely Vikrama-era' commencing with autumn instead of the spring-month Caitra.\n\n2 He is compared to an eastern hill because of the long line of ridges across his breast and also because of the astronomical reference to the use of this hill in calculating ascensions. The Sanskrit helps the comparison by means of a pun in parvata.\n\n3 We have here a punning reference to the ocean-churning, as the words may also mean 'in revolving in the ocean and attracting Lak\u1e63mi &c.'\n\n4 V\u0101hin\u012bn\u0101yaka=(1) leader of armies, (2) lord of rivers=ocean.

His very voice, deep as the boom-\ning of a drum, inspired the warriors with lust for battle,\nas he said:\n\n'My lord, knaves in themselves most foul mark not how\nthey are themselves deluded by the foul unresting vixen\nfortune, as crows by the koil.

Those for whom, as if themselves incompetent for the task, the very hills appointed by the creator to support the earth vomit forth iron to assist the stroke of clublike arms hard as the thunderbolt,\u2014how can such stout-armed myrmidons of spotless fame even in thought dream aught impossible? Before warriors' hands, glorious in power to quell all opposition\\(^2\\), the sun's rays (hands) are in respect of occupying the realms of space maimed. Only by vulgar report is Yama's dwelling in the southern quarter, essentially it is in the frown of warriors, where are terrible spaces curving with wavy lines like the Great Buffalo's horns\\(^3\\). Strange that heroes roaring like lions in battle\\(^4\\) do not suddenly grow manes along with the thorny hair that bristles under the joy of conflict! The mass of wealth\\(^5\\) born from the four oceans has two dreadful crucibles whereby foes are burnt, the subaqueous fire and the heart of a great hero\\(^6\\). How can the fire's natural heat rest before it has embraced all oceans\\(^7\\)? Idly has the lord of serpents expanded his vast ponderous hood, when by his coils\\(^8\\) he supports merely a clod of earth. Only the arms of warriors, adorned with forearms heavy as a sky elephant's trunk, know how sweet a taste does the earth provide in the enjoyment of a supremacy whose edicts are never set at nought.

[214] But the coward is, like the moon, deer-hearted and pallid of hue\\(^1\\): how can his glory abide steady for even a pair of nights? Expansive is the heroic spirit, raining a spray of boundless glory. The paths of prowess are levelled by the pioneer valour. The portals of pride by their very creak dispel its foes. The open realms of space to valour are lighted by the sheen of swords. Glory, like the earth, derives a loving flush from a dewy shower of the enemies\u2019 blood. Like a row of toe-nails, Royalty also glitters more brightly through rubbing against the grindstone edge of many a king\u2019s diadem jewels. Enemies\u2019 looks as well as a man\u2019s palms are darkened by ceaseless practice in arms. Hundreds of bandages bound about manifold wounds make fame as well as the body white. Hard strokes of swords, falling upon the cuirassed panels of enemies\u2019 breasts, spit forth not only sparks but also glory. Whoso, when his people have been slain by the foe, announces his heart\u2019s grief like a wise man by the breast beating of his enemies\u2019 wives, whose sighs are the wind caused by the descent of hard scimitars, whose tears are those which drip and fall on the body of a lifeless foe, who offers water by the eyes of his enemies\u2019 mistresses\\(^2\\), he and none other deserves fame. No notion of kindred do the enlightened attach to bodies evanescent like a vision come and gone in sleep: with heroes, the conception of body belongs to imperishable fame. As foul lampblack does not so much as touch the diamond mirror, naturally brilliant with a radiance of ever glittering splendour, so sorrow touches not the illustrious. Once more, you are the vanguard of the stout-hearted, the captain of the wise, the foremost of the mighty, the champion of the noble, the forerunner of the illustrious, the prime of the dauntless. Here also you have cool retreats for the abode of fortitude, concealed by the shadow of a forest of strong arms, with the delight of sword-edge water within reach, and the fire of anger ever smoking in the vicinity: stout are those walls whose panels are soldiers\u2019 breasts.\n\n\\(^1\\) Literally \u2018pale of back\u2019: p\u0101\u1e47\u1e0durapri\u1e63\u1e6dhasya \u2018deca\u1e25b\u0101\u1e63ay\u0101 nirlaj-jasya \u2018shameless,\u2019 Comm.\n\n\\(^2\\) Water is offered to the dead.\nThink not therefore of the Gau\u1e0da king alone: so deal that for the future no other follow his example.

Excise their vicious cravings for the umbrella\u2019s shade by awnings of flocking kites blinded by the scent of carnage. Dispel with exudations of tepid blood the unhealthy flush of eyes diseased by the side glances of the harlot, ill-got fame. Assuage by the lancing of sharp arrows the tumours of preposterous hardihood\u00b2. By panaceas of scars from encircling bunches of iron fetters uproot the stinging pains of feet that wanton with yearning for footstools. By the letters of stern command in caustic showers allay the itching of ears alert for the cry of \u2018Victory.\u2019 Remove the unhealthy rigidity of stiff unbending heads by forehead applications of a sandal salve consisting of the gleam of toe-nails. With levies of tribute for nippers extract the splinters of unmannerly forwardness inflamed by the arrogance of wealth. With the radiance of gemmed footstools for lamps pierce the darkness of soldiers frowns produced by windy swelling. Overcome the complications of vain pride with a cure removing heaviness of head by the lightness of kicks. Soften the hardness of the bow-string\u2019s callosities by the warmth of clasped hands folded in a perpetual obeisance. Forsake not the path along which your sire, grandsire, and great grandsire have marched amid the envy of the three worlds. Relinquishing the grief proper to cowards, appropriate, as the lion a fawn, the royal glory which is your heritage. Now that the king has assumed his godhead and R\u0101jyavardhana has lost his life by the sting of the vile Gau\u1e0da serpent, you are, in the cataclysm which has come to pass, the only \u010cesa\u00b3 left to support the earth. Comfort your unprotected people.\n\n\u00b9 \u010craddh\u0101k\u0101muka occurs in this sense in c. III. p. 94.

Let your enemies with nail-scorching clouds of smoke from sighs all hot with the vexation of consecration to new subservience and with dawning light from a horizon of trembling crest gems give your feet a dappled hue. Even Para\u00e7u-R\u0101ma, though reared as a solitary ascetic among the deer, though soft-hearted with the tenderness of his Br\u0101hmanical nature, did yet, when his father was slain, frame his resolve and one and twenty times cut down and eradicated the united power of the K\u1e63atriya stock, which with the fierce echoing twang of its forest of bows\u2019 notched ends [216] could rob the sky elephants of their madness, and could inflame the world with fever by its array of humming bow-strings: what then of my lord, the prince of the magnanimous, whose spirit wields in the native hardness of his frame a thunderbolt? Therefore do you this very day register a resolve, and for the wreck of this meanest of Gau\u1e0das\u2019 life take up the bow, that pennon of the sudden expedition of fate busy in gathering lives. My lord\u2019s body, baked in the flame of humiliation, cannot without the cool application of the crimson sandal-unguent of foes be relieved of this dire fever of pain. Failing the means of allaying the pain of insult, Bh\u012bmasena did yet without the device of any Mandara\\(^2\\) quaff the ambrosia of foemen\u2019s blood, as though it had been sweetened by Hi\u1e0dimb\u0101\u2019s kisses. And Jamadagni\u2019s son bathed in pools of K\u1e63atriya gore, whose coolness was grateful to the touch by assuaging the fever of anger\u2019s fiery flames.\n\nSo much said he ended, and my lord Har\u1e63a replied:\u2014\n\n\u2018The advice of your eminence deserves to be acted upon.

Hi\u1e0dimb\u0101 is the wife of Bh\u012bma.\nclutch the tresses of the very hills that will not bow. My heart would force chowries upon even the sun's presumptuously bright hands\\(^1\\). Enraged at the title of king, my foot itches to make footstools of even the kings of beasts. My lip quivers to command the escheatment of the very quarters of heaven so wilfully occupied by their headstrong regents. How much more therefore now that such a woeful issue\\(^2\\) has come to pass! My mind, brimming with passion, has no room for complying with the observances of mourning. Nay, so long as this vile outcast of a Gau\u1e0da king, this world-contemned miscreant, who deserves to be pounded, survives, like a cruel thorn in my heart, I am ashamed [217] to cry out helplessly with dry lips like a hermaphrodite\\(^3\\). Until I evoke a storm of rain from the tremulous eyes of the wives of hostile hosts, how can my hands present the oblation of water? But small store of tears have these eyes till they have seen the smoke cloud from this vilest of Gau\u1e0das' pyre. Listen to my vow: 'By the dust of my honoured lord's feet I swear that, unless in a limited number of days I clear this earth of Gaudas, and make it resound with fetters on the feet of all kings who are excited to insolence by the elasticity of their bows, then will I hurl my sinful self, like a moth, into an oil-fed flame.' So saying he gave instructions to Avanti, the supreme minister of war and peace, who was standing near: 'Let a proclamation be engraved': \"As far as the orient hill, whose summit the Gandharva pairs abandon when alarmed by the hurtle of the sun's chariot wheels,\u2014as far as Suvela\\(^4\\), where the calamity of R\u0101ma's devastation of Ceylon was graven by axes hewing down the capital Trik\u016b\u1e6da,\u2014as far as the western mount, the hollows of whose caves resound with the tinkling anklets of Varu\u1e47a's intoxicated and tripping mistresses,\u2014as far as Gandham\u0101dana, whose cave-dwellings are perfumed with fragrant sulphur used as scent by the Yak\u1e63a matrons; let all kings prepare their hands to give tribute or grasp swords, to seize the realms of space or\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Or 'rays.'\n\n\\(^2\\) Durj\u0101te vyasane.

I am gone abroad. Like a cripple, how can I rest, so long as my feet are not besmeared with an ointment found in every continent, consisting of the light of precious stones in the diadems of all kings?\"\n\nThus resolved, he dismissed the assembly, and having sent away the feudatories, left the hall once more desirous of the bath. Having risen, he performed all his daily duties like one restored to himself. And from the face of the three worlds, which had heard the vow, the day with heat allayed faded, like the spirit of self-assertion, away. [218] Later on when even the adorable sun, reft of his radiance, had disappeared, as if afraid of the loss of his own sovereignty; when even the red-lotus beds, apparently through fear, were closing and hiding the buzzing of their bees\u00b9; when the birds, motionless and checking as if in fright the agitation of their wings\u00b2, were becoming invisible; when in honour of the afterglow, which, like the king's vow, embraced the whole world, all the people with bowed heads joined a forest of adoring hands; when, as if the sky regents, apprehensive of falling from their station, were erecting a circle of sky-kissing iron bulwarks, the heavens were being hidden by an array of thick mists; Har\u1e63a did not stay long at the evening levee. The very lamps around, whose flames shook in the wind from the swaying shawls of bending kings, seemed to salute him, as he dismissed the company, and, interdicting the servants from entering, passed into the bed-chamber. There he lay prostrate and stretched upon the bed his languid limbs. As soon as he was left alone with his lamp, fraternal affection, finding its opportunity like a brigand, held him in its grasp. Closing his eyes, he beheld his senior living as it were in his heart. Without a pause his sighs issued forth, as\n\n\u00b9 Or 'arrows.'\n\u00b2 Or 'partisans.'\nif in quest of his brother's life. Covering his face with a flood of tears in place of a white shawl's hem, he wept long and silently; and these thoughts were in his heart: 'How could such a form as his possibly deserve an end like this? Our sire had a hard-knit frame like a broad mass of rock: but, like the iron-stone from the hills, my brother was harder still. How after losing him does it become me, heartless that I am, even to draw one breath? This is my love, devotion, attachment! What child even could approve of my surviving his death? Whither so suddenly has that noble unity gone? Accursed fate has parted me from him without even an effort. Unfeeling that I am, my grief has been all this time obscured by rage\u2014fie upon it!\u2014and I have not even abandoned myself to tears. Frail beyond question are the loves of mortals, fragile as a spider's web. Kinship can be only a conventional tie, if even I sit here apparently self-contained like a stranger when my lord has gone to heaven. What profit has dastard destiny reaped by parting a pair of happy brothers with hearts blessed in the union of mutual love?' [219] My lord's virtues, once grateful to all creatures as if made of moonlight, do now that he has passed to another world verily burn, as if they had caught fire from his pyre.' These and the like mournful meditations were in his mind.\n\nWhen day dawned, he gave early instructions to the chamberlain that he desired to see Skandagupta, the commandant of the whole elephant troop.\n\nSummoned by a succession of numerous people running all together, Skandagupta, not waiting for his elephant, hastened on foot from his quarters with bustling lictors forcing the people aside. At every step he questioned the chief elephant doctors, who bowed on every hand, as to the night's news concerning the favourite elephants. All around him was a bustle of groups of people belonging to the camp. In front ran throngs of unemployed persons, come for the purpose of bursting the animals' fastenings.\n\n1 The comm. however explains an\u0101yatt\u0101\u00b7hastip\u0101r\u00e7varak\u1e63in\u0101\u1e25 'elephant attendants.'\nand looking like Vindhya forests as they filled the expanse of heaven with thickets of bamboo clumps bedecked with uplifted peacocks' tails. With them were riders displaying handfuls of emerald green fodder, soliciting fresh-caught elephants, or bowing from a distance in delight at getting prime wild ones, or reporting the approach of rut in one under their charge, or ordering the drums to be mounted. First of all came some who, having been deprived of their elephants for careless offences, wore their beards long in mourning, while ragged new comers ran up in hope of the happiness of securing one. Troops of superintendents of decoys, finding at last an opportunity, were busy with hands uplifted enumerating the serviceable females. Rows of foresters with tossing badges of twigs strove by upraising forests of tall goads to announce the number of fresh captured elephants which they had secured. Crowds of mahouts displayed leathern figures for practising man\u0153uvres\\(^1\\). [220] Emissaries from the rangers of elephant forests, sent to convey tidings of the movements of fresh herds and momentarily expecting supplies of fodder, reported the commissariat stores at villages, towns, and marts.\n\nBeneath an aspect of indifference the bearing of a great minister, upheld by his master's favour, and a natural unbending rigidity gave to Skandagupta an air of command. He seemed to enjoin the very seas to provide a limitless supply of shells for elephants' ears, to pillage the very hills for store of red-chalk unguents to paint their heads, to deprive Indra of his Air\u0101vata's charge over the sky elephants. His tread, heavy as when Kail\u0101sa bent\\(^2\\) beneath the weight of \u00c7iva's step, sought, as it were, to quell the earth's pride in her power to support great weights. His swinging arms, which reached his knees and dangled as he moved, appeared to plant on either side an avenue of stone pillars for elephant posts. A somewhat full and pendulous lip, sweet as ambrosia and soft as young sprays, suggested a bait to allure the\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) These were figures of elephants used in training the animals for battle.\n\n\\(^2\\) Or n\u0101mita 'was bent' (Kashmir).\nelephant of \u00c7ri. His nose was as long as his sovereign\u2019s pedigree. A pair of long eyes, exceedingly soft, sweet, white, and large, as if they had drunk the Milk Ocean, gulped down the expanse of heaven. His forehead was full and wide beyond even Meru\u2019s flank. His hair, very long, naturally curling and rejoicing in a soft dark colour as if from growing in a perpetual umbrella shade, appeared, as its tresses tossed and quivered like young tendrils, to cut the sun\u2019s rays and despoil them of their light. Though, owing to the fall of all hostile alliances, he had abandoned the use of the bow, yet all the ends of heaven heard the echo of his great qualities\\(^1\\). With a whole army of raging elephants at his disposal, he was yet untouched by presumption\\(^2\\). Great in station, he was yet full of sweetness\\(^3\\): royal yet full of virtues\\(^4\\): chief of the generous\\(^5\\) as of elephants: wearing his dependence with the enviable undaunted dignity of sovereignty: raised to a position in the king\u2019s favour, unapproachable, like a noble wife, by others and fast fixed by love to one lord: disinterested kinsman of the wise, unsalaried servant of the great, unbought slave of the prudent.\n\n[221] Entering the palace, he saluted from a distance, leaning his lotus hands upon the earth and touching it with his head. When he had seated himself in not too great proximity, Har\u1e63a addressed him: \u2018You have received a full account of my brother\u2019s destruction and my own intentions. You must therefore hastily call in the elephant herds out at pasture. The hot pain of my brother\u2019s defeat forbids even the briefest delay in marching.\u2019 Thus addressed Skandagupta replied with an obeisance: \u2018Let my master consider his orders executed. Loyal devotion, however, requires of me a few words. Therefore let your majesty hear.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Or \u2018bowstrings.\u2019\n\n\\(^2\\) Or \u2018rut.\u2019\n\n\\(^3\\) Or \u2018though made of ashes, yet full of sap.\u2019\n\n\\(^4\\) Or \u2018made of earth, yet consisting of threads.\u2019 Cf.

When even the wretched worms named snakes brook no insult, how should such mines of valour as yourself? Yet the story of his majesty R\u0101jyavardhana has given you some inkling into the despicable characters of vile men. Thus do national types vary, like the dress, features, food, and pursuits of countries, village by village, town by town, district by district, continent by continent, and clime by clime. Dismiss therefore this universal confidingness, so agreeable to the habits of your own land and springing from innate frankness of spirit. Of disasters due to mistaken carelessness frequent reports come daily to your majesty\u2019s hearing\\(^2\\). In Padm\u0101vat\u012b there was the fall of N\u0101gasena\\(^3\\), heir to the N\u0101ga house, whose policy was published by a \u00e7\u0101rik\u0101 bird. In \u00c7r\u0101vasti faded the glory of \u00c7rutavarman, whose secret a parrot heard. In M\u1e5bittik\u0101vat\u012b a disclosure of counsel in sleep was the death of Suvar\u1e47ac\u016b\u1e0da.\n\n[222] The fate of a Yavana king was encompassed by the holder of his golden chowrie, who read the letters of a document reflected in his crest jewel.

K\u0101kavar\u1e47a, being curious of marvels, [223] was carried away no one knows whither on an artificial aerial car made by a Yavana condemned to death\u00b9.\n\nThe son of \u00c7\u012b\u00e7un\u0101ga had a dagger thrust into his throat in the vicinity of his city. In a frenzy of passion the over-libidinous \u00c7u\u1e45ga\u00b2 was at the instance of his minister Vasudeva reft of his life by a daughter of Devabh\u016bti\u2019s slave woman disguised as his queen. By means of a mine in Mount Godhana, joyous with the tinkle of numerous women\u2019s jewelled anklets, the M\u0101gadha king, who had a penchant for treasure caves\u00b3, was carried away by the king of Mekala\u2019s ministers to their own country. Kum\u0101rasena, the Paupika prince, younger brother to Pradyota, having an infatuation for stories about selling human flesh, was slain at the feast of Mah\u0101k\u0101la by the vampire T\u0101laja\u1e45gha. By drugs whose virtues had been celebrated through many different individuals some professed physicians brought an atrophy upon Ga\u1e47apati, son of the king of Videha, who was mad for the elixir of life. Confiding in women, the K\u0101linga Bhadrasena met his death at the hands of his brother Vi\u015basena, who secretly found access to the wall of the chief queen\u2019s apartments. Lying on a mattress in his mother\u2019s bed, a son of Dadhra, lord of the Karu\u1e63as, encompassed the death of his father, who purposed to anoint another son\u2074.

Carried away by fondness for troubadours, the Maukhari fool K\u1e63atra-varman was cut down by bards, his enemy\u2019s emissaries, with the cry of \u2018Victory\u2019 echoing on their lips. In his enemy\u2019s city the king of the \u00c7akas, while courting another\u2019s wife, was butchered by Candragupta concealed in his mistress\u2019 dress. [224] The blunders of heedless men arising from women have been brought sufficiently to my lord\u2019s hearing. Thus, to secure her son\u2019s succession, Suprabh\u0101 with poisoned groats killed Mah\u0101sena, the sweet-toothed king of K\u0101\u00e7i\u00b9. Ratnavat\u012b, pretending a frenzy of love, slew the victorious J\u0101r\u016btha of Ayodhy\u0101 with a mirror having a razor edge\u00b2. Devak\u012b, being in love with a younger brother, employed against the Sauhmya Devasena an ear lotus whose juice was touched with poisoned powder. A jealous queen killed Rantideva of Viranti with a jewelled anklet emitting an infection of magic powder\u00b3: Vindumat\u012b the V\u1e5bi\u1e63\u1e47i Vid\u016bratha with a dagger hidden in her braided hair\u2074: Ha\u1e43savat\u012b the Sauvira king Vi\u1e63asena\u2075 with a girdle ornament having a drug-poisoned centre: Paurav\u012b the Paurava lord Somaka by making him drink a mouthful of poisoned wine, her own mouth being smeared with an invisible antidote.\u2076\n\nSo much said, he ended and went forth to execute his master\u2019s orders.

With streams of flame issuing from cavities of hideous open mouths, ill-omened jackals dismally even in the day time howled long and with no fair presage. Down swooped vultures, red as young monkeys\u2019 faces in the roots of their wings, as if full well acquainted with dead men\u2019s flesh. All at once the trees in the parks put forth untimely flowers, as though to say farewell. Vehemently wept the statues in the halls, beating their breasts with strokes of agitated palms. The warriors, as though their heads had vanished in fear of the near clutching of their hair, beheld themselves headless in their mirrors. [225] Upon the crest gems of the queens appeared footprints marked with wheels, conchs and lotuses\\(^1\\). The chowries of the slave women slipped suddenly from their hands. Even in lovers\u2019 quarrels the soldiers, averted from their mistresses, turned their backs for a long while away. On the elephants\u2019 cheeks were parted the honey-symposia of the bees. As if sniffing the scent of Yama\u2019s buffalo, the panting steeds refused to eat the green young grass, ripe\\(^2\\) though it might be. In the courtyards the sluggish peacocks would not dance, though coaxed by girls clapping music accompanied by the sound of tossing bracelets. Near the gateways night after night troops of dogs howled shrilly without cause, upturning their faces as if their eyes were fixed upon the moon\u2019s deer. Shaking her forefinger as if to count the dead, a naked woman wandered all day long in the parks. Upon the inlaid pavements uprose lines of grass swaying like the curved hairs upon a deer\u2019s hoofs.

The king had bathed in golden and silvery vessels, like autumn clouds which were skilled\\(^1\\) in pouring water; had with deep devotion offered worship to the adorable Nilalohita\\(^2\\); fed the up-flaming fire, whose masses of blaze formed a rightward whorl; bestowed upon Br\u0101hmans sesamum vessels of precious stones, silver, and gold in thousands, myriads also of cows having hoofs and horn tips adorned with creepers of gold-work\\(^3\\); sat upon a throne with a coverlet of tiger skin; duly anointed first his bow and then his body down to the feet with sandal bright as his own fame; put on two seemly robes of bark silk marked with pairs of flamingos; formed about his head a chaplet of white flowers to be, like the moon\u2019s digit, a sign of the supreme\\(^4\\); [227] drawn to the\n\n---\n\n1 Or \u2018white,\u2019 the rainless autumn clouds being so.\n2 = Rudra-\u00c7iva.\n3 This clause is much curtailed in the Kashmir text, which omits all mention of gifts to Br\u0101hmans, and by a zeugma makes the king sacrifice the cows.\n4 Parame\u00e7vara=(1) king, (2) \u00c7iva.\nregion of his ear a fresh gorocan\u0101-spotted D\u016brv\u0101 spray like a sprout of light from the emerald in his ear-ornament; and wound upon his forearm together with the seal-bracelet an amulet to prosper his going. After being sprinkled on the head with a spray of lustral water scattered by the hand of the highly honoured and delighted Purohit, he had sent away valuable equipages, and divided among the kings ornaments anointing the heavens with a copious light of jewels, had loosed the prisoners, and bestowed suitable gifts of favour upon distressed pilgrims and nobles; and had installed his right arm, which by a reminding throb at the moment brought itself as it were to notice, in the office of subduing the eighteen continents. Finally with all good omens pressing forward officiously, like devoted servants, in the van, amid a clamourous cry of 'Victory!' from the delighted people, he issued forth from his house, like the Golden Foetus from Brahm\u0101's egg, to set on foot an age of gold.\n\nThe starting place was fixed at a large temple built of reeds not far from the city and close to the Sarasvat\u012b. It displayed a lofty pillared gateway, an altar supporting a golden cup adorned with sprays, affixed chaplets of wild flowers, wreaths of white banners, strolling white-robed people, and muttering Br\u0101hmans. During the king's stay there the village notary appeared with his whole retinue of clerks\u00b9, and saying, 'Let his majesty, whose edicts are never void, even now bestow upon us his commands for the day,' so presented a new-made golden seal with a bull for its emblem. The king took it. As soon however as a ball of earth was produced, the seal slipped from the king's hand and fell face downwards upon the ground, and the lines of the letters were distinctly marked upon the nearly dry mud and soft earth of the Sarasvat\u012b's bank. Apprehensive of an evil omen, the courtiers were depressed, but the king thought in his heart: 'The minds of the dull are indeed blind to reality. The omen signifies that the earth shall be stamped with the single seal of my sole command: [228] but the rustics\n\n\u00b9 Karan\u012b, cf. the Hindi Kiran\u012b, 'a clerk.' The Comm. suggests an alternative rendering 'requisites for writing.'\ninterpret otherwise.' Having thus mentally welcomed the omen, he bestowed upon the Br\u0101hmans a hundred villages delimited by a thousand ploughs. That day he spent in the same place, and when night arrived, complimented all the kings and retired to rest.\n\nAt the close of the third watch, when all creatures slept and all was still, the marching drum was beaten with a boom deep as the gaping roar of the sky elephants. Then, after first a moment's pause, eight sharp strokes were distinctly given anew upon the drum, making up the number of the leagues in the day's march.\n\nStraightway the drums rattled, the n\u0101nd\u012bs\u00b9 rang out joyously, the trumpets brayed, the k\u0101halas hummed, the horns blared; the noise of the camp gradually increased. Officers occupied themselves in arousing the courtiers. The heavens were confounded by a confused noise of drumsticks added to a rapid tapping of mallets\u00b2. Commanders mustered crowds of barrack superintendents\u00b3. Thousands of torches lighted by the people made inroads upon the darkness of night with their glare. Loving pairs were roused from sleep by the tramp of the women of the watch\u2074. Shrill words of command from the marshals dispelled the slumbers of blinking riders. Awakened elephant herds vacated their sleeping stalls. There was a shaking of manes from troops of horses risen from sleep. The noisy camp resounded with mattocks uprooting ground fastenings. Elephant hobbles rattled as their pins were extracted. Rearing horses curved their hoofs at the clear low noise of chain-keys brought towards them.

Store-room stewards collected stores of platters. Many elephant attendants\\(^2\\) were pressed to convey the stores. The houses of the neighbourhood were blocked with clusters of cups and vessels, which were lifted upon numerous elephants, while the riders kept the animals steady. Wicked elephants were loaded with a cargo of utensils hurriedly tossed upon them by travel-practised domestics. Amid the laughter of the crowd helpless corpulent bawds lagged as they were with difficulty dragged along with hands and legs sprawling sideways\\(^3\\). Many huge and savage elephants trumpeted as the free play of their limbs was checked by the tightening of the girth-bands of their gaudy housings. A jangling of bells taking place in the elephant troop inflamed all ears with fever. Camels, as sacks were set on their backs, bellowed at the outrage. The carriages of the high-born nobles' wives were thronged with roguish emissaries sent by princes of rank. Elephant riders, deceived as to the time of starting, searched for new servants. Highly honoured footmen led the fine\\(^4\\) horses of the king's favourites. An array of gay gallants employed thick unguents to draw circular lines of camphor on their persons\\(^5\\).

Stablemen dragged along half-eaten shoots\\(^2\\) to be eaten at the morning manoeuvres. Loud grew the uproar of foragers shouting to one another. Much crashing of stables resounded as the young rearing horses swerved in the confusion of starting. Women, hastening at the call of riders whose elephants were in readiness, presented unguents for the animals' heads. The low people of the neighbourhood, running up as the elephants and horses started, looted heaps of abandoned grain. Donkeys ridden by throngs of boys\\(^3\\) accompanied the march. Crowds of carts with creaking wheels occupied the trampled roads. Oxen were laden with utensils momentarily put upon them. Stout steers, driven on in advance, lagged out of greed for fodder lying near them\\(^4\\). In front were carried the kitchen appliances of the great feudatories. First ran banner-bearers. Hundreds of friends were spectators of the men's exits from the interior of their somewhat contracted huts. Elephant keepers, assaulted with clods by people starting from hovels which had been crushed by the animals' feet, called the bystanders to witness the assaults. Wretched families fled from grass cabins ruined by collisions. Despairing\\(^5\\) merchants saw the oxen bearing their wealth flee before the onset of the tumult. A troop of seraglio elephants advanced where the press of people gave way before the glare of their runners' torches. Horsemen shouted to dogs tied behind them.

Girths, confining on either side the ends of the saddle, kept their cloth cushions motionless and gave a firm seat. The clash of their swaying foot-rests augmented the sound from the precious stones in their anklets\u00b2. Their shanks were covered with their proper covering\u00b3 of delicate tinted silk. Their copper-coloured legs were chequered with mud-stained wraps, and a heightened white was produced by contrast with trousers soft and dark as bees\u2074. They wore tunics darkened by black diamonds glistening on bright forms\u2075; chinese cuirasses thrown over them\u2076, coats and doublets showing clusters of bright pearls, bodices speckled with a mixture of various colours, and shawls of the shade of parrots' tails. Fine waistbands\u2077 were wound about flanks made thin by exercise. Servants ran up to loose dangling earrings which had become entangled with pearl necklaces, tossed by their movements.

The recesses of the world were filled with proud restless warriors who bounded along, gay with round K\u0101rdara\u1e45ga shields of various colours and chowries tossing in front of them. The abysses of the heavens resounded with the noise of the tinkling golden ornaments upon hundreds of prancing K\u0101mboja horses.

After a brief interval he came forth, riding upon a female elephant, which by the play of its flapping ears, swaying as it moved, seemed on this the king's first expedition to be producing an assemblage of earth-supporting elephants\\(^2\\) for a conquest of the different quarters. An auspicious umbrella, distinguished by a turquoise rod and, by reason of the bits of ruby inlaid at its top, glowing as in anger at the sight of the sunrise\u2014this, and a tunic of new silk, which clung about him, softer than the plantain fruit, as if he were a second king of snakes, recalled the day of the ambrosia churning when clouds of the Milk Ocean's foam whitened the skies\\(^3\\). Raised while still young, like the tree of paradise, to the station of an Indra, he veneered the heavens with a powder for placing the whole world at his disposal in the shape of the pollen from the bunches of flowers in his ear-wreath, which was tossed abroad by the wind of the flapping chowries.\\([233]\\) His splendour seemed to drink up\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The Kashmir text and the Comm. read for -colai\u1e25 -khola\u012b\u1e25: kholah\u00b7\u00e7irastram, 'helmets' or 'turbans.'\n\n\\(^2\\) I.e. by reason of the reverberations of the sound.\n\n\\(^3\\) Or punningly 'wearing robes white as the Milk Ocean's foam.'

His lip, smeared deep with betel and vermillion, was like a seal assigning away the various island continents in fief to loyal affection\\(^1\\): while in the guise of a horizon of light from pearl necklaces, he forced chowries upon the very heavens. With his brows capriciously raised a third part in reviewing the royal company, he seemed to enjoin tribute upon even the three worlds. The long rampart of his arms appeared to embrace the seven great ocean fosses with protecting love. Tightly embraced by Glory, having with her all the sweetness of the milky ocean, he was, as if made of ambrosia, drunk in by thousands of eyes upraised in curiosity by the people of the camp. The weight of his great qualities seemed to sink him deep in royal hearts all moist with affection; the flood of his magnificence to anoint the very marrow\\(^2\\) of the beholders. Like the Lord of the Immortals, he appeared busy in wiping away the stain of his elder brother's\\(^3\\) slaughter: like Prithu, sweeping away all the gathered kings\\(^4\\) with intent to cleanse the earth: like the sun, preceded by thousands of ushers, like rays, heralding his appearance\\(^5\\) and clearing the way, nimbly moving in deft performance of their duty, stern in enforcing order, effecting as it were the seizure of the very regions of space, which were hidden by the press of frightened fleeing people, teaching the very wind decorum by swallowing up his goings in a mass of waving pennons, expelling the very sun's rays, which were repelled by a cloud of dust upraised by hurrying feet, keeping aloof the very day, which was hurled aside by the light from a foliage of golden maces.\n\nThen as the company of kings bowed, with bodies dutifully bent down, hearts thrilling with fear, heads all agleam with the light of golden diadems whose gems were loosened\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) *Anur\u0101ga* may punningly mean 'redness.'\n\n\\(^2\\) *Majjanniva, majj\u0101mapi*, MS.\n\n\\(^3\\) Indra killed Vi\u1e63\u1e47uvar\u016bpa, the three-headed son of Tva\u1e63\u1e6dri, who was *agraja* in the sense of being a Br\u0101hma\u1e47a.\n\n\\(^4\\) Or 'hills,' cf.

Thus welcomed with bows, the hero of heroes, purchasing as it were the kings' souls in the shape of adoration, distributed among them tokens of his favour, such as quarter glances, side-glances, full glances, raised eyebrows, half-smiles, jests, plays upon words, inquiries after their health, return greetings, careless movements of the brow, and instructions, according to their several deserts.\n\nThe king having started, the echo of musical instruments spread loudly hither and thither about the four quarters of heaven, like the snorting of sky elephants affrighted at the tumult. As, angered against their brethren in the sky, the elephants emitted their triple flow, the tracks of the ichor torrent, all black with bees, appeared to pour thousands of K\u0101lindi's rills\\(^3\\). The sun's radiance being crimsoned with masses of vermilion powder, the birds\\(^4\\) feared that the sunset was come. The booming of the drums was lost in the noise of elephants' ear-flapping, strengthened by the uproar of bees. A host of waving chowries swallowed up the whole totality of things moving and motionless.

Blinded by a night of dust, the day blossomed out in a morning light from lines of coronet gems. The heavens were deafened by the din which the horses made with their clanging golden and silvery rows of chariot ornaments. As if to quench utterly the fire of foe-men\u2019s valour, [235] the elephants bedewed the circle of the quarters with a hot drizzle of ichor. The light of crest gems, flickering like lightning, stole from all eyes the power to open. The king himself was surprised at his forces, and casting his eyes in every direction beheld an army starting out of its encampment, in appearance like the animate world tumbling at an aeon\u2019s commencement from Vi\u1e63\u1e47u\u2019s belly, the ocean overflowing the world in a stream from Agastya\u2019s mouth, the Narmad\u0101\u2019s flood rolling a thousand rills after being dammed and let loose again by Arjuna\u2019s thousand arms.

'O friend of the distressed, raise this ox from the mud.' 'This way, boy! in the thick of the dense elephant squad there is no getting out.'\n\nHere groups of elephant men, bachelors, knaves, donkey boys, camp followers, thieves, serving men, rogues, and grooms, sated with an easily acquired meal of plentiful readily pounded remnants of grain, expressed their approval of the camp in bold boisterous jubilation. There poor unattended nobles, over-whelmed with the toil and worry of conveying their provisions upon fainting oxen provided by wretched village householders and obtained with difficulty, themselves grasped their domestic appurtenances, grumbling as follows:\u2014'Only let this one expedition be gone and done with.'

Here, with cries of 'The labour is ours, but when paytime comes some other rascals will appear,' village servants, set to scare on\\(^3\\) the feeble oxen tripping at every step, were indiscriminately badgering the whole body of nobles. There the whole country side had come in eager haste from both directions out of curiosity to see the king, and fools of grant-holders, issuing from the villages on the route and headed by aged elders with uplifted waterpots, pressed furiously near in crowds with presents of curds, molasses, candied sugar, and flowers in baskets, demanding the protection of the crops\\(^4\\): flying before their terror of irate and savage chamberlains, they yet in spite of distance, tripping, and falling, kept their eyes fixed upon the king, bringing to light imaginary wrongs of former governors, lauding hundreds of past officials, [238] reporting ancient misdeeds of knaves.

Elsewhere a cloud of dust was raised by bands of running foragers with loins a mass of fodder bundles and grey with chaff, sickles swinging from one part of their ancient saddles, loose dirty blankets made of bits of old wool, and, dangling in tatters, torn jerkins presented by their masters. In one place riders were intently occupied in rehearsing the approaching Gauda war\\(^4\\). Here all the people, busy with orders to fill up muddy places, were cutting bundles of grass. There shrieking quarrelsome Br\u0101hmans, mounted on the tops of trees, were being expelled by the rods of chamberlains standing on the ground. There village dogs, entrapped by bits of food\\(^5\\), were being tied in leashes. Elsewhere again horses, driven by princes emulous for victory, enlivened the scene by their collisions.\n\nThus the camp, exciting interest by manifold incidents, [239] was like the doom's-day ocean gone abroad to swallow the world at a gulp, hell formed to embower great serpents\\(^6\\), Kail\u0101sa created for the dwelling of the supreme.

Reaching his quarters, he heard the stout-armed princes around expressing their zeal in such talk as this:\u2014'It was the famous M\u0101ndh\u0101\u1e6dri who opened the way to world-conquest. With the irresistible onset of his chariot Raghu in a brief time set the world at peace. Seconded by his bow, P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du imposed tribute on the array of kings haughty in the pride of inherited prowess, nobility, and wealth. Having crossed the realm of China, the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dava Arjuna, in order to complete the R\u0101jas\u016bya sacrifice, subdued Mount Hemak\u016b\u1e6da, whose caves resounded with the twang of the bow-ends of the angry Gandharvas. No obstacle save resolution do the conquests of heroes know. Though shielded by Him\u0101laya with all its snows, the impotent Druma, fearing a trial of strength, bore like a servant the exactions of the Kuru king. Not too ambitious, surely, of conquest were the ancients, seeing that in a small part of the earth there were numerous monarchs such as Bhagadatta, Dantavakra, Kr\u0101tha, Karn\u0101, Kaurava, \u0106i\u00e7up\u0101la, S\u0101lva, Jar\u0101sandha, and Sindhur\u0101ja. King Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira was easily content since he endured quite near at hand the kingdom of the Kimpurushas, when the conquests of Dhana\u00f1jaya had made the earth to shake.

[240] The Deckhan is easily won at the price of valour. Mount Malaya is hard by the Dardura rock, whose cave temples are pleasant with the fragrance of sandal branches tossed by the wind from the southern ocean\u2019s waves; and Mahendra joins Malaya.\u2019\n\nAt the door of his lodgings Har\u1e63a graciously dismissed the chiefs on either side by motions of his brows; then entering, he dismounted and retired to a seat in the outer audience tent, where, after dismissing the assembly, he remained for a short time. Anon the chamberlain, resting both his hands on the earth, announced that Ha\u1e43savega, a confidential messenger sent by the heir apparent of Assam\u00b9, waited at the gate. \u2018Admit him at once\u2019 the king graciously commanded. Inspired by courtesy and respect for the king, the chamberlain went forth in person; and soon Ha\u1e43savega, whose very exterior, delighting the eye with graceful flexions, belied the weight of his qualities, entered the palace in courtly style, followed by a long train of men carrying munificent presents. While still at some distance he embraced the courtyard with his five limbs\u00b2 in homage. At the king\u2019s gracious summons to draw near he approached at a run and buried his forehead in the footstool: the king having laid a hand on his back, he approached again\u00b3 and once more bowed. Finally he assumed a position not far away, indicated by a kindly glance from the king, who, turning his body a little aside, sent away the chowrie-bearer standing between, and face to face inquired familiarly, \u2018Ha\u1e43savega, is the noble prince well?\u2019 \u2018At this moment,\u2019 was the reply, \u2018he is well, since your majesty so respectfully inquires with a voice bathed in affection and moist with a flow of friendship.\u2019 After a momentary pause he went on in courtly terms: [241] \u2018Excepting only a heart replete with respect, a present worthy of your majesty, who is a vessel for the grandeur of\n\n\u00b9 Pr\u0101gjyot\u012bsa.\n\u00b2 I.e. hands, feet, and head.\n\u00b3 For the construction nyastahast\u0101\u1e25 pristhe p\u0101rthivena cf.

Nevertheless my master, in his endeavour to add substance to his message, has fulfilled the destiny of this umbrella derived from Varu\u1e47a, a family heirloom\u2014\u0100bhoga its name\u2014by consigning it to a worthy charge. It manifests many wonder-moving miracles. Every day, to give coolness to its shade, the moon\u2019s rays, from their stored-up thousands, penetrate it one by one. This having entered, pure sweet showers of moon-bright water, skilled to teach the lore of chattering teeth, drip at will and as long as desired from its jewelled ribs. Whoso, like Varu\u1e47a, is or is to be sovereign of the four oceans, him and no other does it honour with its shade. Fire does not burn it, nor wind bear it away, nor water wet it, nor dust defile it, nor age corrode it. Let your majesty honour it with a glance. My commission you shall hear\u00b9 in confidence.\u2019 So speaking, he turned round and commanded one of his own men to rise and display it.\n\nThe words were scarcely spoken when the man rose, raised it aloft, and drew it from its wrapper of white bark-silk. Even as it was drawn forth in its exceedingly white splendour, it seemed as if \u00c7\u012bva had burst into a wild laugh, the circle of \u00c7e\u1e63a\u2019s flattened hoods had leapt gleaming up from hell, the Milk Ocean had stood fixed in circular shape in the sky, an autumn array of clouds had joined company in the firmament, Pit\u0101maha\u2019s swan equipage had rested with poised wings in the ether, the day of the moon\u2019s birth from Atri\u2019s eye had appeared to the people with all the charm of its disc of white effulgence, the instant of the lotus\u2019 uprising from N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a\u2019s navel had been revealed, the delight of gazing to satiety upon the moonlit twilight had been granted to the eye, a vast round sand-isle of the heavenly Ganges had emerged in the bosom of the sky, and the day been exchanged for the full-moon night.

Closing their voiceless lips in fear of a gathering of autumn clouds, the groups of domestic peacocks turned away in despondency. In a mad joy at the moon, opening their petals with a broad gleaming smile, the white lotus beds awoke.\n\nWith wonderment in their minds the king and chiefs, as their glance mounted up in the line of the handle, gazed with awe upon that great world-marvel of an umbrella, which might be compared to the triple world\u2019s forehead mark, the White Island\u2019s babyhood, the autumn moon\u2019s partial incarnation, Dharma\u2019s heart, the moon-world\u2019s palace, Empire\u2019s mouth with its white circle of teeth, the sky\u2019s circular hair-parting showing a white line of pearls in array\\(^1\\), the moon\u2019s halo with its white centre of great effulgence, Air\u0101vata\u2019s round ears at rest in all the loveliness of their white smiling shells, the world-adored track of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u all pale with Ganges\u2019 white eddies\\(^2\\). Tied around its rim was a circle of small chowries, made of lotus fibre from M\u0101nasa and resembling the flames of light from Varu\u1e47a\u2019s diadem. To its point was attached for an emblem a han\u015ba with pinions poised as if waiting anxiously to hear the tinkle of imperial glory\u2019s anklets. Its charming stock was a smooth miraculously stiffened lotus root from Mand\u0101kini, like a V\u0101suki with closed hoods, converted to a rod. Its whiteness seemed to cleanse the Zodiac, its outgoing flood of radiance to veil the day, its height to depress the heavens. It was like an ascent of all fair omens, a white bower for Glory, a cluster of flowers on the tree-trunk of Brahm\u0101\\(^3\\), the moonlight\u2019s round navel, the white smile of Fame, the gathered foam of the water of all swords\u2019 edges, the nucleus of heroism\u2019s splendour.\n\n[243] This having been first inspected by the king, the servants in due order displayed the remaining presents. Among them were famous ornaments inherited from Bhaga-\n\n---\n\n1 The reference is to the galaxy.\n2 The Ganges is said to issue forth from Vi\u1e63\u1e47u\u2019s foot.\n3 Sc. the world.\ndatta and other renowned kings, ornaments which crimsoned\nthe heavenly spaces with the light of the finest gems: the\nprime of sheeny crest jewels: pearl necklaces which seemed\nthe source of the Milk Ocean\u2019s whiteness: silken towels,\npure as the autumn moon\u2019s light, rolled up in baskets of\nvariously coloured reeds: quantities of pearl, shell, sapphire,\nand other drinking vessels, embossed by skilful artists:\nloads of K\u0101rdara\u1e45ga leather bucklers with charming borders,\nbright gold-leaf work winding about them, and cases\nto preserve their colour: soft loin-cloths smooth as birch\nbark: pillows of sam\u016bruka leather\\(^1\\), and other kinds of\nsmooth figured textures: cane stools with the bark\nyellow as the ear of millet: volumes of fine writing with\nleaves made from aloe bark and of the hue of the ripe pink\ncucumber: luscious milky betel nut fruit, hanging from its\nsprays and green as young h\u0101r\u012bta doves; thick bamboo\ntubes containing mango sap and black aloes oil, and fenced\nround with sheaths of K\u0101potik\u0101 leaves, tawny as an angry\nape\u2019s cheeks: bundles contained in sacks of woven silk and\nconsisting of black aloe dark as pounded collyrium, Go\u00e7\u012br\u1e63a\nsandal stealing the fiercest inflammation away, camphor cool,\npure, and white as bits of ice, scent bags of musk oxen,\nKakkola sprays, clove flower bunches, and nutmeg clusters,\nall bristling with masses of ripe fruit: cups of ullaku\\(^2\\),\ndiffusing a fragrance of sweetest wine: [244] heaps of black\nand white chowries: carved boxes of panels for painting,\nwith brushes and gourds\\(^3\\) attached: curious pairs of Kin-\nnaras\\(^4\\), ourang-outangs, j\u012bva\u00f1j\u012bvaka birds, and mermen, with\nnecks bound in golden fetters: musk deer scenting the space\nall round them with their perfume: female camara deer,\nused to running about the house: parrots, \u00e7\u0101rik\u0101s, and\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Sam\u016bruka is a kind of deer.\n\n\\(^2\\) The Comm. doubts whether this is the juice of a kind of fragrant\nfruit or a kind of decoction.\n\n\\(^3\\) Sc. to hold the paints.\n\n\\(^4\\) The Kinnaras are described as mythical beings in the shape of\nmen with horses\u2019 heads, perhaps originally a kind of ape. Some species\nof ape may be meant here.\nother birds enclosed in gold-painted bamboo cages and chattering copious wit: partridges in cages of coral: and rings of hippopotamus ivory, encrusted with rows of huge pearls from the brows of elephants\u00b9.\n\nDelighted at the sight of the umbrella, the king mentally welcomed it as a fair omen on his first march, and addressed himself in friendly terms to Hamsavega, saying:\u2014\u2018I marvel not, fair sir, to obtain from the prince, rich in every precious gift, as the moon was got from the ocean, this great umbrella, fit to be held above the head of the Supreme. The first lessons of the great are in conferring favours.\u2019 The collection of presents having next been removed, after a moment\u2019s pause, \u2018You require rest, Hamsavega,\u2019 he said, and dismissed him to the chamberlain\u2019s house. Rising himself, he bathed, and then, seeking fair auspices, entered eastward the shade of Abhoga.\n\nThe very moment he entered, such a coolness arose from the shade that the moon seemed to have become his crest jewel, dew-dropping moon-stones seemed to kiss his forehead, camphor dust to melt upon his eyes, a frost from drops of dissolving snow to form pearl necklaces, a rain of Haricandana juice to fall without a pause upon his breast, his heart became cool as if made of night-lotuses, an invisible melting ice seemed to anoint his limbs. Astonished he thought, [245] \u2018What but an undying alliance could be a fit return for this present?\u2019 At the hour of dining he sent to Hamsavega the remains of his toilet sandal enclosed in a polished cocoanut wrapped in a white cloth, a pair of robes touched by his person, a waistband called Parive\u00e7a whereof one part\u00b2 showed clusters of clear pearls like autumn stars, an ear-ornament called Tara\u1e45gaka, reddening the day with the light of a precious ruby, and a plentiful repast. In this and other proceedings the day was spent.\n\nAnon the light-wreathed sun, his form dimmed by the great masses of dust from the encamped array,\n\n\u00b9 These pearls are often alluded to in Sanskrit poetry, e.g. Kum\u0101ra-S. i. 6.\n\u00b2 Or perhaps \u2018with the name \u2018Parive\u00e7a\u2019 formed by groups of &c.\u2019\ndipped in the western ocean, as if to cleanse his polluted frame. As though to announce to the god the presentation of the umbrella \u0100bhoga, he departed to Varu\u1e47a\u2019s quarter. By the closing of all the day-lotus beds the earth with all her isles seemed prematurely to clasp hands in obeisance before her lord. Like a glow of affection for the king, the twilight flush, akin to the proffered homage of the whole animate creation, took the world in its embrace. The eastern heaven grew dark, as if alarmed at the Gauda\u2019s sin. Beneath the gathering gloom the earth became a black expanse, as though the fire of all other kings\u2019 splendour had been quenched. The heavens strewed thick their constellations bright as opening Tagara-blossoms, like flowers for the twilight levee of the ruler of the earth. Dust-grey\\(^1\\) in the sky shone Air\u0101vata\u2019s track, as though he had rushed towards the fragrance of the ichor of the scent elephants in the camp. Abandoning Indra\u2019s quarter, as if infected by the sniff of the angered tiger-king, the lover of Rohin\u012b\\(^2\\) mounted the firmament. Over the ten quarters the moon\u2019s rays sped, thrilling, like rumoured invasion, the hearts of proud ladies. Agitated in the play of their creatures\\(^3\\), the lords of rivers shook as if sick with terror at the emperor\u2019s new march. Leaving all the realms of space, the weft of darkness passed into the cave hollows, like anxiety into the hearts of kings\\(^4\\).\n\n[246] From the night-lotus beds, as from the eyes of hostile neighbouring chiefs, sleep waned away.\n\nAt that hour the sovereign, who was lying beneath an extended awning, dismissed his servants with the words \u2018Begone now,\u2019 and then to Hamsavega said \u2018Explain your errand.\u2019 With a low bow the other began his narrative:\u2014\n\n\u2018In former times, your majesty, the holy earth, having through union with the Boar become pregnant, gave birth\n\n---\n\n1 The dusty colour is taken as due to the dust of Air\u0101vata\u2019s speed.\n2 Rohin\u012br\u0101manas, \u2018the moon,\u2019 may also mean \u2018bully,\u2019 which is supposed to be frightened by the tiger\u2019s scent. The tiger-king is Har\u1e63a.\n3 Or\u2014otherwise\u2014\u2018the lords of armies in all the functions of their spirits.\u2019 The \u2018lords of rivers\u2019 are the oceans.\n4 Or\u2014with the usual pun\u2014\u2018mountains.\u2019\nin hell to a son called Naraka. Before this hero's feet, while he was still in his boyhood, the crest-jewels of the lords of nations were apt to bow. Without the command of this stout-armed ruler of the world the sun himself, though scanned with angrily bent side-glances by the female cakrav\u0101kas of the domestic lotus tanks, went not to his setting, and Aru\u1e47a reversed his chariot wheels in fear. It was he who won this umbrella, this external heart of Varu\u1e47a. In the posterity of this hero, when many great Meru-like kings, such as Bhagadatta, Pu\u1e63padatta, and Vajradatta, had passed away, there was born a Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101dhir\u0101ja named Su\u1e63\u1e6dhiravarman, a splendid hero famous in the world as M\u1e5big\u0101\u1e45ka: great-grandson of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Bh\u016btivarman, grandson of Candramukhavarman, and son of Sthitivarman, who wore the unshaken majesty of Kail\u0101sa. This king was born with a pride which seemed unborn. Even as a boy he dealt out presents to all Br\u0101hmans through affection, and reverses\u00b9 to all enemies through hate. In him was seen at its best the so unattainable sweetness of Glory, that child of the salt ocean. For he took away the conch-shells of the lords of armies\u00b2, not their jewels; grasped the stability of the earth, not its tribute; seized the majesty of monarchs\u00b3, not their hardness. To this auspiciously named king was born by his queen Cy\u0101m\u0101dev\u012b a son and heir Bh\u0101skaradyuti, otherwise named Bh\u0101skaravarman, as Bh\u012b\u1e63ma was born to \u00c7antanu by Bh\u0101girath\u012b. Now from childhood upwards it was this prince's firm resolution never to do homage to any being except the lotus feet of \u00c7iva. Such an ambition, so difficult of attainment in the three worlds, may be reached by one of three means, by a conquest of the whole earth, [247] by death, or by a friend like your majesty, peerless hero of the world, burning the heavens with a blaze of impetuous valour. The friendship of monarchs again commonly has regard to utility.\n\n\u00b9 Pratigraha is used in a double sense, (1)=presents given to Brahmins, (2)=the rear of an army.\n\u00b2 Or \u2018lords of rivers,\u2019=oceans. The use of conchs was a sign of independent rule.\n\u00b3 Or \u2018mountains.\u2019\nAnd what possible contribution of utility could incline your majesty to friendship? Wealth is but a remote consideration to your majesty, whose aim is to amass fame. One who relies upon his arm alone has no occasion for desiring the assistance of his other members, much less of a stranger. To one greedy to seize the four combined oceans what gratification is there even in the proffered gift of a part of the earth? Even the alluring present of a beauteous maiden is nothing to one whose eye wantons with the sight of glory\u2019s lotus face. Seeing, therefore, that ours is an object attainable only by impossible expedients, let your majesty, graciously regarding a mere petition, hear. The sovereign of Assam desires with your majesty an imperishable alliance, like that of Kuvera with the foe of K\u0101ma\\(^1\\), that of Da\u00e7aratha with Indra, that of Dhana\u00f1jaya with K\u1e5bi\u1e63\u1e47a, of Vaikartana\\(^2\\) with Duryodhana, of the Malaya wind with the month M\u0101dhava. If your majesty\u2019s heart too is inclined to friendship and can comprehend that friends enter upon a slavery disguised under a synonym, then enough! Commission me to say that the sovereign of Assam may enjoy your majesty\u2019s, as Mandara Vi\u1e63\u1e47u\u2019s, hearty embrace, so that the crushed bits of bracelet\\(^3\\) gems may grind as they clash against the jewelled edges of great arm rings. In this moonlike face, pouring forth a ceaseless ambrosial flood of pure beauty and magnificence, let the glory of the sovereign of Assam at length indulge\\(^4\\) to satiety the longing of her eyes. If your majesty accepts not his love, command me what to report to my master.\u2019\n\nWhen he ceased speaking, the king, who from previous reports of the prince\u2019s great qualities had conceived a very high respect for him and whose affection had been raised to a climax by the affair of the umbrella \u0100bhoga, replied almost bashfully with profound respect:\u2014\u2018How could the mind of one like me possibly even in a dream show aversion, Hamsavega, when such a great and noble spirit, such a\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) I.e. \u00c7iva.

Megha-D. 76, a.\n\n\\(^2\\) Karn\u0101, the son of the sun.\n\n\\(^3\\) Kataka by a pun (= \u2018the slope of a hill\u2019) applies also to Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and the mountain.\n\n\\(^4\\) Or with the Kashmir reading k\u1e63\u0101layatu \u2018bathe her eyes.\u2019\ntreasure of virtue and captain of the worthy, bestows his love as an absent friend upon me? Though keen to scorch the whole world, the rays of him of the piercing splendour fall cool upon the lotus bed that gladdens the eyes of the universe. [248] Who are we, bought by the multitude of his virtues, to be called friends? the ten regions are the unhired servants of the sweet qualities of the noble. Who needed to intercede with the moon on behalf of the night lotus, which exhibits its likeness in a nature absolutely bright and open\u00b9? The prince's design too is excellent. Stout-armed himself, with me, a devotee of the bow, for his friend, to whom save \u00c7iva need he pay homage? This resolve of his increases my affection. The heart respects the lion, though a brute, for his pride: how much more a friend! Therefore use your endeavours that my yearning to see the prince may not torment me long.'\n\nHamsavega responded:\u2014'What else remains? Even your majesty's generous words give a pain to my noble master. The good are timid of dependence, and herein especially our haughty Vaisnava line. But not to mention my master's family, let your majesty consider:\u2014When towards servitude inclined by overwhelming calamity, like a wicked mother, old in years; spurred on by greed like an unsatisfied wife; harassed by ill imaginings with their manifold cravings, begotten of youth, like bad children; beholding circumstances over-ripe, like an elderly daughter in his house, and suggesting recourse to another man; urged to exertion by all planets of distress, like poor kinsmen; pursued by foul deeds, like aged servants, of long standing and not to be shaken off: when thus, cherishing in his heart in vain the desire of grasping the whole round of delights, as though the power of all his senses were blighted, a man makes up his mind to enter a palace, as a malefactor\u00b2.\n\n\u00b9 The argument is that every one, however exalted, is at once attracted by that which is perfect in itself,\u2014the sun by the day lotus, the ten regions by the noble, the moon by the night lotus,\u2014and I by your king.\n\n\u00b2 The notion of the malefactor and the causes which lead him to crime runs through the whole of the preceding.\ncowdung fire, to the burning torment of all his frame,\u2014first of all, withering like a festoon spray at the very portal, he has the distress of being shut out by lackeys. Entering at the door, he is beaten by others like a deer, dashed away time after time, like the dummy in elephants' practice, by buffets from the hands of a group of lackeys\\(^1\\), downbent through greed of wealth, like a tree branch over a treasure. No petitioner, he is turned away and shot forth [249] by the mean\\(^2\\), till he flies into desperation: no thorn, he is plucked away, as he clings to the feet, and hastily hurled aside: no K\u0101ma, he is annihilated by the scorching glance of a master\\(^3\\) angered by his unseasonable approach. Like an ape, he changes not colour when angrily reprimanded: like a Br\u0101hma\u1e47-slayer, he performs degrading offices, forbidden to touch, his shaven poll seared by daily obeisances: like Tri\u00e7\u0101\u1e45ku, he stands day and night with downbent head, excluded from both worlds\\(^4\\): like a horse, he submits for a mouthful of food to be driven at will\\(^5\\): like a fasting monk, he wastes his frame, retaining\\(^6\\) the desire of life in his heart: like a dog, he turns away from his proper spouse and in bondage to vile habits consumes himself: like a dead man, he receives his ball of meal in gruesome\\(^7\\) quarters: like a crow, he lives for nought a wastrel\\(^8\\) life, his manly vigour subservient to a greedy tongue\\(^9\\): like a ghoul frequenting graveyard trees, he hovers about royal favourites made rough by their accursed\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Prat\u012bk\u0101ramandalakara may also mean 'trunks surrounded by gloves.'\n\n\\(^2\\) Am\u0101rga\u1e47asya may also mean 'no arrow' and udvegam vrajatah, 'speeds on its flight.'

Abandoned by shame, as if she were alarmed by hard strokes from chamberlains' canes: avoided by self-esteem, as if stifled in a heart contracted by meanness: parted from magnanimity, as if angered by his condescension to low acts; through devotion to riches he heaps up troubles, increasing his contemptibleness under the idea of magnifying his means. Fool! though there exists a wood fragrant with the scent of myriad flowers, he does homage to a mirage: though a noble, he trembles like a malefactor as he draws near: though of good presence, his being is fruitless as a painted flower: though learned, his speech is as blundering as a fool's:\n\n1 Or 'made rough by the ashes of the burnt.'\n2 Or 'redness.'\n3 Al\u012bkag\u016b\u1e47\u0101dhy\u0101ropana=(1) 'ascribing unreal virtues,' (2) 'stretching an unreal string.'\n4 Or 'but he has no force of an arrow.'\n5 There is a pun here, as nirm\u0101lya might mean 'purity.'\n6 Katuka may mean either (1) 'doorkeeper' or (2) 'hot flavours.'\n7 The reference is to the nihilist tenets of the Buddhists.

The literal sense is that the courtier might have recourse to a life in the woods.\ncapable, he folds his hands helplessly, like a leper. Roasted without fire at the elevation of his equals, dying without expiring [251] at the rise of his inferiors, tossed like a straw by insults, burned without respite by the fire of pain, though partial unportioned, though cold to pride yet scorching his kin, though of humble carriage\u00b9 yet making no way, though his weight is fallen from him yet gravitating downwards, though void of spirit yet a seller of human flesh\u00b2, though free from intoxication yet not master of his actions, though no hermit\u00b3 yet giving up his soul to pensiveness, a burnt-poll\u2074 bowing as soon as he gets up, a domestic fool for ever dancing to amuse the wise, a household fire-brand burning his stock, a human ox bending his neck to get even a wisp of grass, a mass of flesh born only to fill his belly, a sore of his mother's womb, for his sins a servant,\u2014for him what atonement is there? What means of reformation? Whither shall he go to find peace? What is his life like? What manly pride is his? What possible pleasures? What dream of enjoyment? This dreadful name of servant, like a torrent of mud, lays everything low. 'Ah me!' he sighs, 'to hell with such wealth, perdition seize such advancement, hail to such worshipful enjoyments, my service to such grandeur, away with such glory, joy go with such pomp, for the sake of which my head must seek the earth.' An eunuch whose love is but words, a worm of inodorous carrion, a mannikin of no account\u2075, a walking footstool all grey atop with the dust of feet, [252] in coaxing notes a human cuckoo, in gratifying cries a peacock, in bosom-rubbing a land tortoise, in mean fawnings a dog, in modulated notes a pipe, in strainings of body a harlot's person, in the rice-fields\u2076 of manliness a straw, in jerkings of head a lizard, in curling himself up\u2077 a hedgehog,\n\n\u00b9 Or 'though a chariot,' vim\u0101na.\n\u00b2 I.e. his own. Human flesh is offered to goblins or spirits.\n\u00b3 Or 'hapless.'\n\u2074 This was the name of a sect of ascetics.\n\u2075 Or punningly 'a hell of dishonour.'\n\u2076 The word -\u00e7\u0101li\u1e63u is ambiguous=(1) 'rice field,' (2) 'possessor of.'\n\u2077 Of the servant 'in shrivelling up his soul.'\nin rubbing of feet a very footstool\\(^1\\), in slappings with hands a ball\\(^2\\), in beatings with sticks a lute board,\u2014if a wretch of a servant belongs to the world of men, then a r\u0101jila snake is a cobra, and a withered stalk the best of rice. Better for a manly man is a moment of manliness; at the price of bowing the wise deem not even the joy of a world-sovereignty worth a bow. Therefore let your majesty, approving of our love, bethink himself that the king of Assam died only a few days ago.\\(^3\\)\n\nSo much said, he became silent, and shortly after bowed and took his leave. The king spent that night with a heart held captive by yearning for a sight of the prince: for over the great self-devotion works as a charm that needs no simples. On the morrow he sent Hamsavega away with a load of answering gifts in charge of eminent envoys. For\\(^4\\) himself he thenceforth advanced by ceaseless marches against the foe. One day he heard from a letter-carrier that Bhan\u1e0di had arrived with the M\u0101lwa king\u2019s whole force, conquered by the might of R\u0101jyavardhana\u2019s arm, and was encamped quite near. At this news the fire of brotherly grief awoke again; his courage gave way, and he retreated into the darkness as it were of a swoon; laying aside all his occupations, remaining in his own quarters [253] with his attendants noiseless and still through the chamberlains\u2019 prohibitions, he waited awhile with his royal retinue for Bhan\u1e0di\u2019s arrival.\n\nSoon with a single horse and a retinue of a few nobles, he came in sight. His soiled garb, his breast filled with the points of enemies\u2019 arrows, like an array of iron pins implanted to restrain his heart from bursting, his beard resting like reverence for his master in his bosom, all betokened his grief. On his arm, flabby from neglected exercise, dangled for an ornament a remnant of his charm bracelet. His parched lip, faint in colour from careless application of betel, protruded under the force of long sighs,\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) There is some obscure pun in pratip\u0101daka (=\u2018leg of a couch\u2019 text p. 7, l. 2).\n\n\\(^2\\) Read kanduka for katuka with the K\u0101shmir text.\n\n\\(^3\\) Or \u2018by himself.\u2019\n\n\\(^4\\) Or \u2018by himself.\u2019\nlike a coal from a heart burning with sorrow's flame, and with a stream of tears for a shawl he hid his face, as though abashed by the crime of preserving his life after his master's removal. With limbs enfeebled he appeared to shrink through shame into himself: and his long sighs seemed to vomit forth the now purposeless prowess of his arm. Like a sinner, a criminal, a malignant he seemed, like a man plundered and deluded, a young elephant despondent at the fall of the monarch of the herd, a lotus bed robbed of its loveliness by the sunset, Drona's son distracted by Duryodhana's death, the ocean deprived of its jewels.\n\nIn this guise he drew near the king's portals, and, dismounting from his horse, entered the residence with downcast looks. While still some distance away, he uttered a cry and fell at the king's feet. But he, on seeing him, rose, and advancing with tottering steps, uplifted him, and clasping his neck in a close embrace, wept long and piteously. The fury of his grief relaxing, he turned back again and sat as before upon his seat: finally, when Bha\u1e47\u1e0di had wiped his face, he wiped his own. A little time having elapsed, he enquired the facts of his brother's death, and Bha\u1e47\u1e0di related the whole story in full. Next the king asked what was R\u0101jya\u00e7r\u012b's plight. 'Your majesty,' was the response, 'I learnt from common talk that after his majesty R\u0101jyavardhana was taken to paradise and K\u0101nyakubja was seized by the man named Gupta, queen R\u0101jya\u00e7r\u012b burst from her confinement, and with her train [254] entered the Vindhya forest. But not to this day have the numerous searchers sent after her returned.'\n\n'What care I,' the king answered, 'for other seekers? Where she has gone, I myself, abandoning all other calls, will go. Your honour also must take the army and advance against the Gauda.' So saying, he rose and went to the bath chamber; and when Bha\u1e47\u1e0di had caused his mourning beard to be shaved, had bathed in the chamberlain's apartments, and had received signs of favour in the shape of clothes, flowers, unguents, and ornaments for the body, the king ate and spent the day alone in his company.\n\nOn the next day Bha\u1e47\u1e0di, approaching the king, said:\u2014\n'Let your majesty inspect the M\u0101lwa king's army and royal equipage, won by the power of his majesty R\u0101jyavardhana's arm.' The king consenting to this being done, he displayed the booty, such as elephants in thousands, great as moving boulders, with muddy cheeks whose temples were hairy with swarms of bees clamouring about the intoxicating scent of incessantly dripping ichor, elephants booming with deep roars like clouds alighted upon the earth, and, like concentrated autumn days, emitting the fragrance of full-blown Saptacchada groves: horses swift as antelopes and gay with lines of gold-bedight chowries: ornaments of divers kinds, raining floods of morning radiance and by their light covering the heavens with many a rainbow: wondrous pearl necklaces that had toyed with the scent of the bosoms of love-intoxicated M\u0101lwa women, like stars and yet flooding the heavens with a torrent of unborrowed light: yak-tail chowries, like Har\u1e63a's own glories, white as a mass of moonlight: a white umbrella with a golden stock, like the lotus dwelling of \u010cri: beauteous women, like Apsarases come down out of fondness for valour redolent of many a fight: regal paraphernalia such as lion thrones, couches, and settees: all the M\u0101lwa king's adherents with their feet restrained by iron fetters: the whole of his treasure chests, heavy laden with wreaths of ornaments and provided with written records of their contents.\n\nThe inspection over, the king appointed overseers to take charge of the booty according to their several functions. The next day [255] he set out with the horse in search of his sister, and in a comparatively few days' march reached the Vindhya forest referred to. Entering, he saw while still at some distance a forest settlement, distinguished by woodland districts turned grey by the smoke from granaries of wild grain in which heaps of burning Sa\u1e63\u1e6dika\u00b9 chaff sent up a blaze. Wherein were huge banyans, encircled with cowpens formed of a quantity of dry branches; tiger-traps, constructed in fury at the slaughter of young calves\u00b2; zealous\n\n\u00b9 A kind of rice ripening in sixty days, commonly called s\u0101th\u012b.\n\u00b2 Vatsar\u016bpaka: cf. vatsar\u016bpa p. 257 l. 3 from end, Bombay ed., and Comm. sv\u0101lp\u0101 vats\u0101 * vatsar\u016bp\u0101\u1e25.\nforesters violently seizing the axes of trespassing woodcutters; and Durg\u0101 arbours built of tree clumps in the thickets. The outskirts being for the most part forest, many parcels of rice-land, threshing ground, and tilth were being apportioned by small farmers, and that with no little vigour of language, since it was mainly spade culture and they were anxious for the support of their families. No great amount of coming and going tramped the earth owing to the difficulty of ploughing the sparsely scattered fields covered with K\u0101\u1e63a grass\u00b9, with their few clear spaces, their black soil stiff as black iron, the branches bursting from the tree trunks set up here and there, their growths of impenetrable Gya\u1e47\u0101ka, their wealth of Alambusa, and their Kokitak\u1e63a bushes not yet cleared away. Near the tillage scaffolds constructed above ground suggested incursions of wild beasts.\n\nIn every direction at the entrance to the forests were drinking arbours made of wayside trees, which by their coolness seemed to dispel the summer heat: arbours, where the shade was dappled by fresh shoots made grey by the dust of travellers\u2019 stamping feet, where were N\u0101gasphu\u1e6da bushes planted in the vicinity of freshly dug tanks bedecked with bunches of S\u0101l flowers easily obtained from the woods, tiny huts formed of close-woven wattles, heaps of crocks dotted with meal and encircled by twisted braids of flies, stones of rose apples which travelling folk had eaten scattered over the ground about them, masses of Dh\u016bli-Kadamba flowers with the pollen formed, wooden stands surmounted by an array of bristling\u00b2 water jars to steal away thirst, cool porous vessels with dripping bases for allaying weariness, pitchers black with moist aquatic plants for the purpose of keeping the water cold, bits of pink gravel taken from ewers to cool the air, cups having pink flowers tied by straw whisps about their necks, tree trunks bristling with bunches of juicy young mango fruit forbidden to wither by bundles of dew-besprent twigs, and successive troops of resting pilgrims drinking the water.\n\n\u00b9 The Kashmir text and \u039b read k\u0101\u00e7ilai\u1e25.\n\u00b2 Kan\u1e6dakita = \u2018containing grass stalks\u2019? cf. c. v. p. 139.\nIn other places again [256] blacksmiths were almost intensifying the heat by burning heaps of wood for charcoal. On every side the prospect was filled with the inhabitants of the district, who dwelt in the surrounding country, entering the woods to collect timber and enveloped in the provisions guarded for them by old men stationed in the hamlet houses of the vicinity. Their bodies they had anointed to prepare themselves for their hard sylvan toils. On their shoulders were set strong axes, and about their necks hung their breakfast bundles. They wore ragged clothes for fear of thieves. Their water they bore in jars having mouths covered with corks of leaves and attached to their necks which were encircled by triple collars of black cane. Strong oxen marched before them in couples.\n\nRanging on the outskirts were hunters, who grasped snares with intricate loops formed of animals\u2019 sinews, and bore coiled traps and netted nooses fastened to a quantity of screens used in shooting wild beasts. Fowlers roamed hither and thither, loaded with cages for falcons, partridges, kapinjalas, and the like, while their boys loitered about with aviaries hanging from their shoulders. Troops of childish trappers wandered in eager pursuit of female sparrows caught with twigs whereon a little castaway pulse broth was smeared. Young hunters, practising bird-catching, coaxed on a tribe of dogs frightened at partridges hidden in clumps of grass.\n\nThere were people moving along with bundles of \u00c7idhu bark, hued like an old ruddy-goose\u2019s neck, countless sacks of recently uprooted Dh\u0101tak\u012b flowers of the colour of red ore and of cotton plants, plentiful loads of flax and hemp bundles, quantities of honey, peacocks\u2019 tail-feathers, wreaths of compressed wax, barkless Khadira logs frilled with hanging L\u0101majjaka grass, large bundles of Ku\u1e63\u1e6dha, and Rodhra yellow as a fullgrown lion\u2019s mane. Village wives hastened en route for neighbouring villages, all intent on thoughts of sale and\n\n1 Or yuga may mean \u2018yoke\u2019: for balad read balavad with the Kashmir text, or with A purahsaradbalivarda.\n2 M\u1e5bigatantu?\n3 The MS.

The surrounding country was black with numerous sugar cane enclosures, showing wide carefully tended branches, buffalo skeletons fixed on stakes to scare with their sharp points the rabbits which devastated the rising buds, and high bamboo fences which the antelopes lightly leapt when startled by ox-drivers\u2019 sticks which the watchers hurled at them.\n\nAt very wide intervals were the dwellings of the forest householders, girt with orchards of emerald-bright Snuh\u0101, entangled with thickets of bamboo suitable for bows, and difficult of access owing to rows of thorny Kara\u00f1ja. They had garden enclosures with clumps of Garmut, Gavedhuk\u016b, Granthiparna, \u00c7igru, S\u016bra\u1e47a, Surasa, V\u0101\u1e45gaka, Vac\u0101, and the castor plant, and a network of K\u0101sth\u0101luka creepers, reared upon tall planted uprights, provided a shade. Young calves\u00b2 were tied to Khadira stakes fixed in the ground in circular jujube arbours, and crowing cocks more or less indicated the positions of the houses. At the foot of Agasti\u00b3 trees in the yards tanks and drinking vessels\u2074 for birds had been constructed, and pink masses of jujube were scattered around. The walls were formed of partitions made of [258] slips of bamboo, leaves, stalks, and reeds, while for ornament gorocan\u0101 pigment and Kim\u00e7uka flowers were used\u2075. There were piles of charcoal tied with Valvaja grass, numerous\n\n\u00b9 Reading sairika (\u1e25\u0101lik\u0101) with Comm. and A.

But one day as he was wandering, the son of \u00c7arabhaketu, a tributary chief in the forest, named Vy\u0101ghraketu, taking with him a young mountaineer, came up to the king. Now the young mountaineer had his hair tied into a crest above his forehead with a band of the \u00c7y\u0101malat\u0101 creeper dark like lampblack, and his dark forehead was like a night that always accompanied him in his wild exploits, with an involuntary frown which branched in three lines; his ear had an ear-ring of glass-like crystal fastened in it, and it assumed a green hue from a parrot\u2019s wing which ornamented it, while his somewhat bleared eye, with its scanty lashes, seemed by its native colouring to distil hyena\u2019s blood\\(^4\\) which had been applied as a medicine,\u2014his nose was flat, his lower lip thick, his chin low, his jaws full, his forehead and cheek-bones projecting, his neck a little bent down [260] while one half of his\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Cf.

His brawny thighs were covered with the flesh that had as it were fallen down from his waist which had grown thin and spare in his early youth; his dark body\u2075 seemed as it were to blossom with a leathern quiver on his back, made of a bear\u2019s skin, wrapped round with a spotted leopard\u2019s skin, its woolly hair black with the bees that clustered on it, and filled with arrows bearing mostly crescent-shaped heads; he carried a hunter\u2019s extemporised box of colours with him in a partridge whose red palate was displayed through its open beak, while its neck was strung on the end of the sharp notched extremity of the bow, and a hare whose soft white hair on its breast was clearly seen by reason of its body being stretched out (as it hung suspended), while its nostrils were stained with a line of blood red like a Bandh\u016bka flower and an extempore svastika sign was produced by one of its legs which was caught in a hole cut by an arrow in the other\n\n\u00b9 Skanna may mean \u2018fallen, drooping.\u2019\n\u00b2 Godanta is said to be a white fossil substance, apparently an earthy salt.

His right hand seemed busily engaged with a vikarna\u2074 arrow, having its point dipped in a potent poison, and looking like a black snake which had been stupefied by certain roots\u2075. He was like a moving dark Tam\u0101la tree on the side of a mountain or a pillar of solid stone artificially wrought\u2076, or a moving mass of black collyrium [261] or a melting block of iron from the Vindhya,\u2014a very fever to the elephants, the noose of death to the deer, a comet of ill omen to the lions, the last day of the Durg\u0101-p\u016bj\u0101\u2077 to the buffaloes, the personified essence of destruction, the embodied fruit of sin, the cause of the Kali age, the lover of doom\u2019s-night.\n\nHaving made him stand at a distance, the chief addressed the king, \u201cMy lord, there is a general of the \u00c7abaras named Bh\u016bkampa, the lord of all this Vindhya-range, the leader of all the village chiefs,\u2014this is his sister\u2019s son Nirgh\u0101ta, who knows every leaf in this Vindhya forest, and still more its localities; let your majesty ask him,\u2014he is able to carry out every command.\u201d Nirgh\u0101ta laid his head on the ground and made his obeisance and offered the partridge and hare as his present.

Still according to your command every day a search is carried on by diligent messengers. And in a great thicket of trees, reverenced by munis, which grows at the foot of some mountains a league from this place, there dwells near a mountain stream a wandering mendicant who lives on alms, named Div\u0101karamitra, with a train of disciples,\u2014haply he might learn some tidings.\" The king reflected, \"I have heard that a follower of the Maitr\u0101ya\u1e47\u012b \u00e7\u0101kh\u0101, the boy friend of the deceased Grahavarman of auspicious name, having abandoned the three Vedas, when he was a leading Br\u0101hma\u1e47 teacher, though still young in years, turned his studies to the Buddhist doctrine and assumed the red dress. [262] Now even the sight of a friend generally gives much comfort to one's heart, and the good qualities of every one are worthy of a visit, and who would not shew respect to a muni? And, again, religious asceticism, fit mate to virtue, causes honour to be paid even to a fool,\u2014still more to a really wise man who wins the hearts of all men.

Betel nuts abounded on all sides, the Priya\u1e45gus were brown with quantities of flowers,\u2014everywhere was heard the pleasant murmur of the bees gathered on the sprays which were red with pollen, [263] while the undisturbed rubbing of the elephants\u2019 cheeks was revealed by the tell-tale trunks of the Mucukunda trees, which were stained by the dark ichor. The grassy glades were all bright with the young antelopes skipping about without fear, while the Tam\u0101la trees darker than midnight obscured the sunshine; the Deodars were spangled with their clusters of flowers, while the lines of rose-apples and Jambhiras were studded with patches of flickering betel-vines; the air was kissed by clumps of Dh\u016blikadamba-trees white with the powder of their flowers, while the ground was moist with the dropping honey; the nostrils were refreshed with perfume; the hollow trunks of the Kutujas were tenanted by the hens with their new broods, while the young sparrows uttered their cries as they were tended by the mother-birds, and the beaks of the cakora birds were busy in feeding their mates, and the bhurundas were fearlessly eating the ripe brown-red fruit of the P\u012blu trees, and the merciless parrots were piercing the never-failing fruit of the Katphalas, while they dropped the unripe berries; the young hares basked on the smooth rocks; lizards rolled about securely in the roots of the \u0106ephalika water-plants; the antelopes were free from fear, the ichneumons played in peace, the soft-voiced kokilas devoured the opening buds, the deer lay ruminating in the mango-groves, troops of nitandajas\u00b9 rested at their ease, and the female gayals as they gave milk to their young were watched by the motionless wolves,[264] the drum-like flapping of the elephants\u2019 ears grew languid in the pleasant sleep induced by the lulling sound of the cataracts falling from the mountain slopes near by; the ruru deer listened well-pleased\u00b2 to the songs of the neighbouring kinnar\u012bs, the hyenas were delighted, the snouts of the young boars were stained with\n\n\u00b9 The Schol. explains this as a sort of deer; the name would seem to denote some kind of bird. \u00b2 MS.

His feet were licked by some deer who seemed to drink in ascetic calmness; he propitiated universal charity by means of a young dove which sat on his left hand like a lotus dropped from his ear and ate wild rice, while he dazzled the spectators by the rays which streamed from the nails of his other hand, as he poured water on a peacock, which stood near with its neck uplifted, like an emerald water-jar, or strewed grains of panic and rice for the ants. He was clad in a very soft red cloth, as if he were the Eastern quarter of the sky, bathed in the morning sunshine, teaching the other quarters to assume the red Buddhist attire, while they were flushed with the pure red glow of his body like a ruby freshly cut; with his gently bright eye bent down in humility, before which the lotuses in the lake closed their buds, he seemed to rain ambrosia to revive the little insects which the crowd had unwillingly crushed,\u2014he was the Supreme Buddhist\u00b9 Avalokite\u00e7vara, compacted of all the letter-atoms of all the \u00e7\u0101stras,\u2014absorbed without faltering in penances,\u2014revealing the real nature of all things to the student, like the light,\u2014one whom Buddha himself might well approach with reverence, Duty herself might worship, Favour itself shew favour to, Honour itself honour, Reverence itself revere,\u2014the very source of muttered prayer\u00b2, the circumference of the wheel of religious observance, the essence of asceticism, the body of purity, [267] the treasury of virtue, the home of trust, the standard of good conduct, the entire capital of omniscience, the acme of kindness, the extreme limit of compassion, the very finality of happiness,\u2014Div\u0101karamitra, who was still in the prime of life.

Heroic in mind though he was, he sprang up hurriedly from his seat and gathered together his robe which was somewhat disordered by his sudden movement as it hung from his left shoulder, and, being skilled in courteous compliments, he raised his right hand which was graced with all the lines and signs of a great man, and greeted the king in a gentle voice and with hearty welcome and every good wish; and, shewing all honour to him as to a guru, he invited him to share his own seat.\n\nThen he said to a disciple by his side, \u201cBring water for his feet in an ewer.\u201d But the king reflected, \u201cThe kindness of the noble is a fast bond, though it is not made of iron; with good reason my old friend Grahavarman, devoted to all merit, often described his virtues to me.\u201d He then said aloud, \u201cThis favour which you shew me seems superfluous after the blessing which the very sight of you confers; after you have proved your kindness by welcoming me as your own with your testing eye, the labour of offering me a seat seems only to make me a stranger.

What marvel is not seen by mankind, when this form of thine appears unexpectedly to our view? Such heart-delights help us to infer what our good deeds in former lives must have been. Our penances have given us their fruit even in this life, when they let us look on a favourite of the gods whose sight is so hard to be attained. Our eyes are satiated with ambrosia,\u2014our minds desire not even the happiness of nirv\u0101\u1e47a; it can only have been by great previous merit that our eyes can rest on such a paragon. Happy was the day of thy birth! Fortunate was thy mother who bore thee who givest life to all living creatures. Blessed indeed are those merits, of which thou art the fulfilment. Preeminently meritorious are those atoms which make up the total of thy limbs. Fortunate is that good fortune which has visited thee,\u2014blessed is the human nature which is thine. For verily, though I have been longing for liberation, the sight of thee has made me once more believe in human birth,\u2014without my own will I have seen K\u0101ma himself. The eyes of the wood-nymphs have to-day won their desire; these forest-trees have attained the end of their being, since thou hast come within their range. Thou art all ambrosia\u2014thy words must be only sweet.\n[269] But ponder as I may, I cannot imagine what earthly being could have instructed thee in courtesy, when thou art still such a boy. The range of virtues was void till thou wast born. Happy is the king in whose family thou hast arisen like a precious pearl. My mind is bewildered when I think how we can gratify such a worthy visitor come so unexpectedly. What are we indeed, who share a diet of roots and fruits and a drink of the mountain-stream with every forester? But this wretched body of ours is only for another's service,\u2014all we have is left for the welcome of our friends. Our few drops of learning are at our own\ndisposal, but our friendship cannot hesitate how to make use of them. If it does not hinder some moment of action\\(^1\\), and if the secret can be openly uttered, be pleased to make it known; my heart is all eager to hear. Under what burden of anxiety have you come into this inhospitable place, and how long will you go on wearying yourself with wandering about this empty wood? why is your body thus worn, unfit to bear such hardships?\"\n\nThe king respectfully replied, \"Reverend Sir, you have performed everything by your zealous words which ceaselessly rain forth ambrosia-like honey to gladden my heart,\u2014I am indeed fortunate that a venerable saint should thus consider an insignificant person like me worthy of respect. Be pleased to learn what is the cause of my being fatigued with wandering in the forest. For I have only one young sister left, who is the sole link that keeps up my life, now that I have lost all my loved kindred. Now she, while wandering fearful of outrage from her enemies in consequence of the loss of her husband, entered the thickets of this Vindhya forest, swarming with hordes of vile foresters and unnumbered troops of elephants, and terrible beyond measure with its lions and \u00e7arabhas,\\([270]\\) and having its paths infested by huge buffaloes, and impassable with sharp spear-grass, and full of pits everywhere. Night after night we have been ceaselessly exploring the wood in search of her, but we have not found her. Be pleased to tell me if any tidings of her have reached your ears from some forester.\"\n\nThe holy man made answer with some agitation, \"No tidings of this nature have come to me; we are not worthy to bring to your highness such welcome narrations.\" But while he was thus speaking, a mendicant of tranquil age suddenly came up in bewilderment, and folding his hands before the ascetic spoke in a compassionate tone with his eyes full of tears, \"O my lord, it is indeed a sad occurrence.

If you asked who she was or to whom she belonged or from whence she came or why she entered this wood or why she mounted into the fire,\u2014I want to know in full what she answered to each question, and how she came into your sight and what manner of person she was.\u201d\n\nThe Mendicant replied, \u201cListen, noble Sir. I had offered my worship in the early morning to the sun and I was wandering on and on by the soft sand of this river-bank.

With a sudden feeling of pity I turned to the spot; and there I saw a woman surrounded by a troop of other women, whose eyes were closed with the sharp pain of the spear-points of the \u00c7ara-grass which had pierced their heels, and whose feet were swollen beyond the power of moving by the fatigue of a long journey, while their toes were bleeding with the wounds from the jagged stones; who had birch-bark tied on their ankles which were aching with the wounds from stakes, while their legs were fevered and lame with blisters, and their calves were white with dust, and their knees were torn by the matted fibres of the date-palms, and their thighs were wounded by the \u00c7at\u0101var\u012b shrubs; their silk skirts were torn by the Vid\u0101r\u012b-plants, their jackets rent by the sharp ends of the bambu branches; their soft hands were pierced by the thorny Badar\u012b-creeper as they pulled them down in their wish to gather the fruit, their arms were wearied by the quantities of bulbs, roots and fruits which they had\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The Kashmir text and the Comm. read var\u1e47atantrin\u0101m.\ndug up with the horns of the deer; they chewed the soft myrobalans to relieve the dryness of their mouths without their favourite betel, while they used red arsenic as an ointment for their eyes which were swollen and bleeding with the blows of the flowers of the Ku\u1e63a grass, and their curls were torn by the thorny creepers; some used boughs as umbrellas against the sun, others held plaintain-leaves as fans, others carried water in the hollow of a lotus-leaf, others took the fibrous lotus-roots as their provisions, others carried pine oil\\(^1\\) in cocoa-nuts balanced on loops made of strips of China silk hanging from a yoke; while the rest of the crowd were bewildered eunuchs\\(^2\\), humpbacks, dwarfs, deaf, barbarians, (and all the other mis-shapen guards of the gynaeceum). [272] The centre figure which lay prostrate in the wood, though in deep misery, was still clothed in the grace and dignity of high birth,\u2014her body dyed\\(^3\\) by the reflected boughs of the creepers near by, as if it were covered with the freshly bleeding wounds of her desperate grief,\u2014her feet red, as with the customary lac, through the blood pouring from the wounds made by the hard spikes of Darbha grass, her face pale though shaded by a lotus-leaf which one of the women held up by its stalk,\u2014seeming to be more empty than the desolate ether,\u2014made as of earth in her insensibleness, made as of air in her incessant sighing, made as of fire in her constant fever, made as of water in her streaming outflow of tears,\u2014like the sky in her want of all support, like the lightning in her tremulousness, like sound in her ceaseless wailing, like the kalpa tree of paradise\\(^4\\), dropping off her silken garments, jewels, flowers, gold, and painted decorations. She lay on the ground like Ganges after her descent, while her limbs still shewed their insolent power ready to humble imperial heads (as Ganges trampled on \u00c7iva\u2019s head when she fell upon it); her feet\\(^5\\) were grey with the pollen of the wood-\n\n---\n\n1 Saralatailena Kashm. and MS.

I saw her with her kindred and her graces all gone, her ears and her soul left bare, her ornaments and her aims abandoned, her bracelets and her hopes broken, her companions and the needle-like grass-spears clinging round her feet, her eye and her beloved fixed within her bosom, her sighs and her hair long, her limbs and her merits exhausted, her aged attendants and her streaming tears falling down at her feet, her band of followers and her life reduced to a scanty remnant,\u2014languid in opening her eyes, ready only to shed tears, continuous in anxieties, broken short in hopes, wasted in her body, thick in her sighs, filled with misery, emptied of courage, dominated by fatigue, deserted by her heart, immovable in her purpose but shaken from her self-command,\u2014herself the home of calamities, the receptacle of cares, the abode of ever varying conditions, the fixed site of want of fixity, the seat of fainting fits, the centre of calamities, the goal of misfortunes, the very dismay of dismsays, the special object of pity, the ne plus ultra of helplessness. As I saw her, I reflected, 'Strange! do calamities assail even such a form as this?' But even in that destitute condition she bowed her head respectfully as I came up.\n\n\\(^1\\) Da\u00e7\u0101 also means 'state.'\nthought to myself, as, in my great compassion I wished to speak to her, 'How shall I venture to address such a noble lady? If I call her 'my child' it will be too affectionate, 'mother' will be too flattering, 'sister' will be giving myself too much honour, 'your majesty' would be the address of her attendant, [274] 'princess' will be too general, 'lay sister' will be only my hope, 'mistress' will be to accept the position of her slave, 'lady' would be suitable for other women, 'long-lived one' would be cruelty in the circumstances, 'fortunate one' would be mockery in her present plight, 'moonfaced' would be an improper idea for a muni, 'girl' would be disrespectful, 'venerable' would too much imply old age, 'holy' would not be borne out by the fortune which has befallen her\u00b9, 'madam' would be too applicable to everybody. Moreover, 'who art thou?' would be rude, 'why dost thou weep?' would remind her of the cause of her grief, 'weep not' is not to be said unless one can remove the cause of her tears, 'be consoled' has no foundation to rest on, 'welcome' is flat and stale; 'are you well?' is false.\n\n\"While I was thus reflecting, a woman of venerable aspect but overwhelmed with sorrow, came out from that crowd of women, and laying her partially grey head on the ground, scalded my feet with her tears which expressed the vehement emotion of her bosom, and my heart with her mournful words. 'Holy father, the nature of a religious mendicant is always compassionate for all beings; and the Buddhists are skilled in the self-devotion of relieving every sorrow, and the doctrine of \u010c\u0101kyamuni is the family-home of pity, and the Jaina saintship is ever ready to help everybody, and the religion of the Munis is a means to attain the next world, and no higher kind of merit is known in this world than saving life. Young women are naturally the objects of compassion,\u2014still more so when they are overwhelmed in misfortune; and the good are the 'happy land' of the mourners. This our mistress, being helpless through the death of her father, the loss of her husband, the absence of her brother, and the disappearance of all her other relatives, in her excessive tenderness of heart\n\n\u00b9 Cf.

O save her! Even a saint like thyself may employ in her case those words of thine skilled in such counsels as can remove even unendurable sorrow.\u2019\n\nAs she spoke these mournful utterances, I raised her up and still more distressed myself gently addressed her, \u2018Madam, it is as you say. This noble lady\u2019s grief is however beyond the reach of my words; but your request will not be in vain, if we can save her but for a moment. My own teacher is near at hand, who is like another holy Buddha. When I tell him this occurrence, he will certainly come, boundlessly compassionate as he is. He will guide our pious sister into the path of wisdom by the good words of Sugata which pierce the mists of sorrow, and by his own wise counsels, illustrated with apt examples and weighty with various sacred texts.\u2019\n\nWhen she heard this, she fell again at my feet, urging me to make haste. So I have come in haste, announcing to my teacher this startling and mournful occurrence, which threatens death to so many helpless young women.\u201d\n\nThe king at once understood the mendicant\u2019s agitated words, which were interrupted by his tears, even though his sister\u2019s name had not been mentioned; and with his mind oppressed by grief, and with all uncertainty dissipated by the reflection that her condition so exactly agreed with every circumstance told about her, and with his ears burning at the tidings, said to the chief mendicant, \u201cHoly Sir, this is indeed my poor sister,\u2014base, hard-hearted, cruel and un-\nfortunate as I am, I have left her to fall into this condition through pitiless undeserved misfortunes,\u2014my torn heart only too surely tells me so.\u201d [276] Then he turned to the inferior mendicant and said, \u201cRise up, holy sir, shew me where she is; make haste\u00b9, we will go at once to win the merit of saving these many lives, if by any means we can imagine her to be still alive,\u201d and as he uttered the words he himself sprang up.\n\nFollowed by the holy man who was attended by all his disciples, and followed by all his tributary kings who had alighted from their horses, which they led after them, the king made the Buddhist disciple go in front to shew the road, and went on foot after him, seeming to devour the way with his rapid strides. As he drew near, he heard from between the trees various utterances such as suited the emergency from that crowd of women all anxious to die, \u201cO holy Yama, come quickly,\u2014where art thou, O goddess of our family,\u2014O divine Earth, dost thou not support\u00b2 thy wretched daughter?\u2014whither is Lak\u1e63m\u012b gone, the matron of \u1e62u\u1e63pabh\u016bti\u2019s house? O lord of the Mukhara family\u2074, why dost thou not restore to consciousness this thy widowed wife, distracted with her various griefs? O holy Sugata, thou art asleep to thy distracted worshippers. O Royal Duty, ever fostering the house of Puspabh\u016bti, why art thou become so indifferent? I raise my hands in fruitless supplication to thee also, O Vindhya, thou friend in calamity! O Mother forest, dost thou not hear the cries of this distressed daughter? O Sun, save this devoted wife, helpless in her misery. O thou, saved with difficulty, ungrateful Honour, thou utter barbarian in conduct, dost thou not save the princess? what have her royal marks secured for her?

O queen, thou art indeed happy in the joy of the coming of King Har\u1e63a!\"\n\nAs he heard these various voices, the king hurried up and saw R\u0101jya\u00e7r\u012b fainting as she prepared to enter the funeral pile, and full of agitation, he pressed her forehead with his hand as she lay with her eyes closed in her swoon.\n\n[279] At that reviving touch of her dear brother's hand which seemed to diffuse a life-restoring power as if healing plants were fastened to his arm, and to drop a mysterious influence as of amulets in his bracelets, and to rain ambrosia from the moonbeams of his nails, and to bind on her forehead a moon-gem crest which dropped a cool dew like that which falls when the moon rises, and to calm her fevered heart with his fingers cold like lotus-fibres and to bring back her wandering life, R\u0101jya\u00e7r\u012b instantly opened her eyes. Clasping the neck of her brother thus unexpectedly restored to her as if seen in a dream, and pouring forth a flood of tears from her eyes which were like the channels of two rivers, with the stored reservoir of grief overpowering all her soul and bursting out violently at his sudden appearance,\u2014she cried out, \"O father, O mother, O friends.\" Meanwhile her brother, as he tried to comfort her, covered her mouth with his hands, and kept calling out in a loud voice through the agitation caused by his fraternal affection, \"O my child, be firm,\"\u2014and the holy teacher exhorted her to obey the words of her elder brother, and the courtiers implored her, \"Dost thou not see, O queen, the condition of the king? cease now to weep!\" Her attendants said to her, \"O Mistress, have pity on thy brother,\" and her aged relations restrained her, \"O daughter, cease for the present and weep again at some future time,\" and her young friends counselled her, \"Dear friend, how long will you weep? be silent, you greatly pain the king.\" Though surrounded by all these various comforters, the princess wept violently for a long time with a loud outburst of grief, her throat choked by the tears which broke forth to shew the pressure of the griefs which she had so long pondered over, and her soul filled with the weight of her distress; but when the first vehemence of her emotion\nwas spent she allowed her brother to lead her away from the fire and sat down at the foot of a tree near by. [280.]\n\nThe holy teacher, having slowly recognised that it was Har\u1e63a himself, felt a still deeper feeling of reverence, and, after a short pause, made a secret sign to his disciple, and, the latter having brought some water, he himself presented it to the king in some lotus leaves that he might wash his face. The king also, having respectfully accepted it, first washed his sister's eyes which were flushed from her continued weeping and seemed like a red lotus sprung\\(^1\\) from her long flow of tears, and then washed his own. When the king had washed his face all the spectators stood silent as if painted, and then he turned and spoke gently to his sister, \"My child, salute this holy man. He was your husband's second heart and is our guru.\" At his words the princess made her obeisance, while tears again filled her eyes at the sudden shock of the news that he had known her husband; and the holy man, who felt that his stoical calmness was threatened by the tears which gathered in his own eyes and could only be kept back by an effort, turned away his eyes for a while and heaved a long sigh. After standing still for a time, he tenderly spoke in a gentle voice, \"O virtuous monarch, you have wept long enough, and your royal attendants have not even yet ceased their weeping,\u2014let the due rites of ablution be performed,\u2014when all have bathed, it will be well for us to return home.\"\n\nThen the king, in compliance with right custom and the teacher's words, rose and bathed in the mountain stream, and proceeded to that place with his sister. There he devotedly waited upon her in her sorrow and made her and her attendants partake of the food prepared for the funeral offerings in honour of her husband; and then afterwards ate of them himself. Then he heard from the attendants the full story of his sister's misfortunes from her imprisonment onward,\u2014how she was sent away from K\u0101nyakubja, from her confinement there during the Gau\u1e0da trouble\\(^2\\); through the\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The MSS. read j\u0101tam for j\u0101lam.\n\n\\(^2\\) A. reads Gau\u1e0dasambhramaguptito, B. -sambhrame-.\naction of a noble named Gupta\u00b9,\u2014how she heard the news of Rajyavardhana\u2019s death, and refused to take food, and then how, faint for want of food, she wandered miserably in the Vindhya forests and at last in her despair resolved to mount the funeral pile. [281] Then the teacher came to the king, as he was sitting quietly at the foot of a tree with his sister in a lonely place away from all their attendants,\u2014at first he sat down and waited; and then little by little he thus addressed him, \u201cMy lord, listen,\u2014I have something to say to you. Yonder ear-ring of night, the inconstant Moon, in his pride of youth despised all his many wives, however radiant in their youthful bloom, and carried off T\u0101r\u0101 the wife of Brihaspati the priest of Indra, wishing to make her his own wife, and fled from heaven, and wandered about in many pleasant places with her whose eyes were as beautiful as those of the timid partridge and who was lovely in every limb, and responded to his love\u00b2. But at last through respect for the words of all the gods he restored her to her husband, the lord of speech,\u2014still in his heart he was continually burned, though without fuel, by the fire of absence from her.\n\n\u201cOne day, as he was rising from the Eastern mountain, he beheld his own reflection in the pure water of the ocean, and as he gazed he fondly remembered T\u0101r\u0101\u2019s smiling face, and, stirred with passion, even though in heaven, he dropped big tears from his eyes, which were as bright as if they had drunk up the radiance of all the lotuses. The pearl-oysters swallowed all these tears as they fell into the sea. When they had become pearls in the bellies of the oysters, the King of the snakes, V\u0101suki, dwelling in hell, somehow became possessed of them; and he made of them a single wreath which shone even in hell like a cluster of stars; and he called it Mand\u0101kini. By the power of the holy Soma\u00b3, the lord of all plants, it became an antidote against all poisons, and in consequence of its having been produced from the moon which is the ever-cool fountain of ambrosia, its touch relieves the pain of all creatures. V\u0101suki therefore\n\n\u00b9 See supr. pp. 178, 224.\n\u00b2 Abhik\u0101may\u0101, A.\n\u00b3 The Moon.\nalways carried it about with him to soothe the burning heat of poison [282].\n\n\"As time passed on, one day a mendicant named N\u0101g\u0101rjuna was brought to hell by the n\u0101gas; he begged it from the snake-king as a gift and received it. When he went out of hell, he gave it to a king, his friend, S\u0101tav\u0101hana, the lord of the three oceans\u00b9; and in course of time it came into our hands by the regular succession of pupil-hood. Although to offer a present to one so exalted as yourself is almost an insult, still I pray you to deign to accept it in consideration of its potency against poison, since you know the virtues of medicines, and, as you are ever engaged in helping all living beings, your life well deserves to be guarded.\" So saying he uncovered the pearl-wreath Mand\u0101kin\u012b, which was wrapped up in the skirt of the mendicant who was standing near by.\n\nWhen the pure bright mass of rays suddenly gleamed forth as the jewel was unveiled, illumining the different quarters of space, it was as if the trees burst out from their very roots as longing for their twining creepers to bud\u00b2,\u2014as if troops of wild geese in the lakes hurried as it were eager for new lotus roots, making the sky white with their flapping wings,\u2014as if orchards of Ketak\u012b-trees blossomed, white with the pollen as the clusters burst open through their weight, and bright with the needle-like anthers\u00b3 made visible by the opening of the calyx,\u2014the lotuses seemed to awake, rough with their unfolding leaves,\u2014the lions moved about, seeming as if they filled the horizon with their tossing light-coloured manes\u2014the wood-nymphs smiled, as though besprinkling the forest-glades with the flashing of their teeth,\u2014thickets of K\u0101\u00e7a grass blossomed, as though laughing openly with their filaments bursting out of their buds,\u2014herds of yaks roamed about, looking white as they waved their bushy tails,\u2014the mountain streams seemed to dash along, rolling their waves which swelled and foamed and danced\u2014\n\n\u00b9 He therefore ruled Jambudv\u012bpa, Plak\u1e63adv\u012bpa and \u00c7\u0101lmalidv\u012bpa.\n\u00b2 Lit. \u2018budding creeper-brides\u2019.\n\u00b3 Or is it \u2018the sharp long leaves\u2019?\nthe full moon seemed to rise as though rejoicing in gaining a new set of stars, as its circle of spreading rays filled the different quarters of the sky,\u2014the day seemed to be made clean though its horizon had been grey with the ashes of the forest-fires, and the faces of the women soiled with tears were as it were washed once more [283].\n\nThe king, after repeatedly opening and closing his eyes which were dazzled by the mass of rays in front of him, at last with a great effort beheld the wreath filling all the quarters of the heavens as if it were the collected spouting of all the elephants of the sky, or the cloudless\u00b9 autumn moonlight drawn in lines there, or the path of the new moon\u2019s motion with its steps clearly traced, or the wreath of the seven rishis dropped motionless from their hands\u00b2, or a digit of the moon in the North-east quarter, eclipsing the splendour of all the ornaments in the world\u00b3, or beauty embodied with its quality of whiteness in perfection, risen from the milky ocean, or Ganges, which takes away all misery, come down to the successive mountains of our earth, or a banner of silk ceaselessly fluttering which announces the coming of embodied Imperial power, or the teeth of \u00c7iva seen directly in front, white like camphor, or Lak\u1e63mi\u2019s garland which she gave at her svayamvara, fulfilling her bridegroom\u2019s desires, or the joyous smile of the goddess of Earth\u2074 hardly visible beneath her concealing hand, or the rosary of personified Royal Duty, intent on its three great objects, counsel, treasure and an army, or the tablet inscribed with the catalogue of Kuvera\u2019s treasures, ornamented with his own seal\u2075. As he gazed, he was filled for a long time with astonishment.\n\nThen the teacher, taking it up, bound it on the king\u2019s noble shoulder, and the king, shewing his pleasure, thus\n\n\u00b9 Or\u2014punningly\u2014\u2018having great pearls\u2019.\n\u00b2 Or\u2014punningly\u2014\u2018without the constellation hasta\u2019.\n\u00b3 Or\u2014punningly\u2014\u2018eclipsing the ashes worn by \u00c7iva the ornament of the whole world\u2019.\n\u2074 The Kashmir text and MS.

Ever since I beheld you I have been devoted to you, with my heart captivated by your pre\u00ebminent virtues. This body of mine is placed unreservedly at your disposal till death. You are now absolutely free to do with it what you please.\"\n\nAfter a while, when the courtiers had discussed the beauty of the wreath, R\u0101jya\u00e7\u1e5bi, having gained courage, called her betel-bearer Patralat\u0101 and whispered something in her ear; and the latter turned respectfully to the King and said, \"Sire, the queen bids me say that she never remembers to have uttered before a loud remark in your highness' presence, far less a command; but this outrageous tyranny of sorrows makes her speak, and this sad plight brought about by evil fate makes her forget her due respect\u00b9. A husband or a son is a woman's true support; but to those who are deprived of both, it is immodesty even to continue to live, as mere fuel for the fire of misery. Your highness' coming stopped my resolution to die, even on the point of accomplishment; let me therefore in my misfortunes be allowed to assume the red robe.\" The king heard her and remained silent for a time.\n\nThen the teacher spoke gravely, \"O lady, verily sorrow is a synonym for 'demon,' another form of epilepsy, the heyday of darkness, a peculiar kind of poison, an undying\u00b2 King of the city of the dead; it is a flame which has no nirv\u0101\u1e47a, a consumption which never ends; a Jan\u0101rdana\u00b3 where no Lak\u1e63m\u012b dwells, a mendicant\u2074 who has nothing to do with holiness, a destroyer of sleep, yet without wisdom\u2075, [285] a\n\n\u00b9 MSS.

The stern command of Yama goes forth at once through the world, offering the sacrifice of the lives of all beings. The drums of the Lord of the dead keep incessantly clanging, skilled in announcing the departure of all living beings. The messengers of fate roam in companies in every quarter and in every city, with eyes red like hot iron, and bodies black like the K\u0101lak\u016b\u1e6da poison and carrying black nooses in their hands. The proclamations of the dreadful onset for the destruction of all living beings pass from house to house, striking terror through the din of the bells of Yama, as they are shaken in the hands of the awful messengers. In every direction run the broad highways of the travellers to the other world, with the young jackals which haunt the cemeteries howling for joy,\\([287]\\)\u2014highways crowded with the biers of the dead, discoloured with the hair scattered by the widows, and echoing with their wailings of grief,\u2014while the eyes of the vultures eagerly watch the banners of the King of the dead, as they flutter grey with the smoke of the funeral piles. The tongue of the goddess of Doom\u2019s-night, black like the charcoal of the funeral piles and covered with blood, licks up the lives of living beings, like a cow that licks her calf\u2019s shoulder,\u2014eager to swallow all creation as a mouthful. The hunger of the god of death, as he devours all beings, never learns satiety. The stream of the transitory rushes on ever speeding. The meetings of the company of the five elements last only for a moment. The sticks that compose the body\u2019s machine\\(^3\\), which encages the soul, are apt to fly asunder in the night. The atoms which build up this corporeal frame, are ready to crumble, helpless against the onsets of good or evil fortune. The threads of the cords that bind the living principle break at a touch. Nothing is self-depending,\u2014all is ending.\n\n\u201cConsidering all this, O wise woman, thou surely wilt\n\n\\(^1\\) The MS.

A single moment of reflection steadies the soul. And though sorrow has made a wide inroad, is not thy elder brother to be regarded by thee, who is as a guru and as a father? Were it not for him, who would not honour thy noble resolve to assume the red dress? A holy mendicant life is the surest consolation for every sorrow; this is the best home for the wise. But he now stops thy desire, for thou must only do what he commands. Whether thou regardest him as a brother, as an elder, as one beloved, or as a virtuous man, or as a King,\u2014thou must in any case obey his decree.\"\n\nWhen he ceased, the King replied, \"Who could speak thus except your reverence? You and your fellows are the pillars, created by destiny, of its own will and unasked, to support the world under its grievous calamities. [288] You are the lamps of religion, softly bright with kindness and powerful to dispel the darkness of delusion. But excessive affection like mine, when emboldened by kindness thus lavishly shewn to it, learns to covet what is properly beyond its reach; and to receive great favours, emboldens even a cautious man to venture, urged on by his levity of heart, and self-love teaches even a retiring man to thrust himself forward, forgetful of all considerations of what is proper or improper. But the noble will always on their part recognise the constraining influence of a request, as the ocean-tide recognises its shore; and your highness made over to me this your body, unsolicited\u00b9,\u2014primarily to shew me hospitality. Therefore I would prefer a petition to my honoured lord\u00b2. My sister, so young and so tried by adversity, must be cherished by me for a while, even if it involves the neglect of all my royal duties; but I also made a vow in the presence of all the world, when I bound myself to obey my right arm which was uplifted to destroy the insolent enemies who had slain my brother; and unable to endure the insult offered, I surrendered my whole soul to\n\n\u00b9 Scil. when he accompanied Har\u1e63a; the Kashmir edition (but not A.) reads abhyarthitena.\n\u00b2 He here uses the Buddhist term 'bhadanta.'\nrighteous vengeance. Will your highness therefore deign to employ himself for a while in this business of mine? Grant this body of yours to me your guest\\(^1\\). From this day forth, while I discharge my vow, and console my subjects in their sorrow for my father's death, I desire that she should remain at my side and be comforted with your righteous discourses, and your passionless instruction which produces salutary knowledge, and your advice which calms the disposition, and your Buddhist doctrines which drive away worldly passions. At the end, when I have accomplished my design, she and I will assume the red\\(^2\\) garments together.\u2014What will not the magnanimous grant to a suppliant? Dadh\u012bca, that ocean of constancy, made the lord of heaven win success by the gift of his bones\\(^3\\). How often did not Buddha, the chief of Sages, when his compassion was appealed to, disregard his own life, and offer himself as a victim to carnivorous animals? You well know other instances besides these.\u201d [289] Having uttered these words, the King was silent.\n\nThe Buddhist sage replied, \u201cThe fortunate do not need to utter their wishes twice; at once by means of the thought alone you make your virtues receive the homage of the offering of your servants' bodies\\(^4\\). The service of one so incapable of true service is tied to your command whether in a great or a small matter.\u201d Pleased at the way in which the other so warmly accepted his friendship, the King, after staying there that night, the next morning dismissed Nirgh\u0101ta, well satisfied with gifts of garments and ornaments, took his sister with the holy man and went back, in a few marches, to his camp stationed along the bank of the Ganges.\n\nAs he was relating there to his friends the story of the recovery of R\u0101jya\u00e7ri, the sun completed his journey through the heavens; and the day, dear to the cakrav\u0101ka pairs, folded\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) I.e. become in turn my guest.\n\n\\(^2\\) K\u0101\u015b\u0101y\u0101\u1e47i.\n\n\\(^3\\) The myth of Dadhyac (later Dadh\u012bca) occurs in the Rig-veda; the bones were used as thunderbolts against V\u1e5btra.\n\n\\(^4\\) The MSS.

The Sun absorbed again in his body the web of his sanctifying\\(^1\\) rays, which had been spread far and wide to the ends of the world, red like freshly spilt blood, just as the preceptor \u00c7\u0101kalya swallowed back the Yajur-veda\\(^2\\) vomited by his disobedient disciple Y\u0101j\u00f1avalkya. Then in gradual succession, the Sun, bright with its gathering mass of deepening colours, seemed to be like the congenital crest-jewel\\(^3\\) which Bh\u012bma carried off from A\u00e7vatth\u0101man\u2019s turban, horribly red with the fresh blood;\u2014or like the begging vessel consisting of Brahm\u0101\u2019s\\(^4\\) skull, filled with the blood from the veins of the bald heads, which \u00c7iva flung down in his furious eagerness to present a Rudra-alms,\u2014or like the far-stretching lake of blood\\(^5\\), made by R\u0101ma (J\u0101madagnya) when incensed at his father\u2019s murder,\\([290]\\) and filled through a thousand channels from the throats of the vile K\u1e63atriyas, which were cut by the axe which cleft the bull-like shoulder of the monstrous K\u0101rtav\u012brya,\u2014or like the tortoise Vibh\u0101vasu\\(^6\\) as it rolled in the sky, bereft of life and with head, paws and feet contracted through fear in its round shell and covered with blood from the attacks of Garu\u1e0da\u2019s cage-like claws,\u2014or like the egg which contained Aru\u1e47a\u2019s half-formed embryo body when its mother Vinat\u0101 broke it\\(^7\\);\u2014or like a cliff of Meru, rich in metallic ore, tossed up by the goddess K\u0101l\u012b, vexed at the long delay of the world\u2019s destruction beyond its appointed time,\u2014or like the awful cauldron of Brihaspati\\(^8\\), bearing signs of the cooking of an oblation in some magic rite for the destruction of the demons, and having its inside red with the\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) P\u0101pamum\u015bi.\n\n\\(^2\\) One or two words have been supplied here from the Commentary.

At the close of the evening-tide, the moon was brought to the King as a respectful offering by the Night, as if it were the impersonated Glory of his Race bringing him a cup from the pearl Mountain, to slake his boundless thirst for fame,\u2014or the impersonated glory of the Kingdom bringing him the stamp of the primeval King\\(^2\\) on the silver patent of his sovereignty, to encourage him in his resolve to bring back the golden K\u1e5bita age,\u2014or the Goddess of the Future\\(^3\\) conducting a messenger from the White Dvipa to animate him to the conquest of all the seven Dv\u012bpas\\(^4\\).\n\nHere ends the eighth chapter in the great poem, the Har\u1e63a-Carita, composed by \u010cr\u012b B\u0101na Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da, the son of Citrabh\u0101nu, and crest-jewel of the company of great poets.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) A name of \u010civa.\n\n\\(^2\\) Manu or Prithu Vainya.\n\n\\(^3\\) Or perhaps 'Majesty' (\u0101yati).\n\n\\(^4\\) This concluding description, like all such in the book, is at least semi-symbolical ('the pathetic fallacy'). The sunset is described in terms suggesting bloody wars and the fall of Har\u1e63a's enemy, followed by the rising of the moon of Har\u1e63a's glory.\u2014B\u0101na's narrative abruptly ends here which was begun in p. 79.\nAPPENDIX A.\n\nI.\n\nThe following is the description of M\u0101lat\u012b omitted p. 25.\n\n[35] 'Under the semblance of her form\u2019s radiant halo she seemed to be bringing with her all the pure water of the river. Like Gaur\u012b on her tiger, she was mounted upon a great maned steed, in colour resembling a bunch of opened Atimuktaka blossoms. Sportively inserted in the girth of her horse, which turned prick-eared to listen to the clear tinkle of the anklets, her feet, glowing with clotted lac and stained with saffron on the upper surface, poured out on either side bright red streams of light, as if she were trailing forests of sprouting red A\u1e63okas, attracted by morbid cravings for her kicks'. [36] About her loins a girdle rang like a proclamation devoting to murder and rapine the hearts of all the animate world. Hanging down to her toes, a gown of white bleached silk, lighter than a snake\u2019s slough, concealed her creeper-like form. Visible through the robe\u2019s thin fabric, her limbs, white with viscous sandal, suggested a lake with lotus fibre-stalks discernible \u2019mid the translucent water. Underneath gleamed a petticoat of safflower tint and variegated with spots of different colours, as if she were a crystal ground enclosing a treasure of jewels. Dotted as with clusters of large bright planets by a collar of pearls round as Amalak\u012b fruit, she recalled the autumn\n\n1 A reference to the superstition that the A\u1e63oka cannot blossom until kicked by a woman, cf. p. 149 supra.\nsky, overcast with a mass of thin white cloud. Above bosoms like full cups she wore a necklace with jewelled pendants, spraying forth red and green rays, like a festoon of wild flowers signalizing the entrance of some happy man into her heart. Set upon her forearms, each golden bracelet, having an emerald crocodile-shaped signet, made green the ends of heaven with a texture of light like land lotus-beds accompanying her under the idea that she was Lak\u1e63m\u012b. Her joined lips, darkened by a deep black stain of betel, seemed to pour forth, mingled with the afterglow, a dusk swallowed up by her moonlike face. A thick swarm of bees, settling eagerly upon the blooming blue lotuses of her eyes, covered half her face like a veil of dark blue silk. Attached to her left ear, a peacock-blue earring, of a tint borrowed from indigo, resembled a patch of dark cloud amid her lightning radiance. [37] From a pair of pendant ear-ornaments, formed of three pearls comparable to Vakula fruit, she poured a rain of light, as if besprinkling her soft creeper-like arms. Her right ear being provided with a pendant in the shape of a string of leaves containing Ketaki flowers\u00b9, it seemed as if the moon\u2019s tongue were through greed for her beauty licking her cheek. Her face, Love\u2019s sum of riches, bore, as it were, for a seal, a round sectarial mark, black as Tam\u0101la-bark and dispensing a fragrance of civet. Dancing upon her forehead and kissing her hair-parting was a frontal jewel, whose upward-streaming flickering radiance formed, as it were, a shawl of red muslin about her head. With tresses hanging loose from careless fastening and swaying at her back, as if wearing a streamer of dark chowries, she resembled the pennon of K\u0101ma with her crest-jewel for its crocodile\u00b2. She might be described as the moon\u2019s family goddess, the simple which could restore to life the God of the flowery bow, the shore of love\u2019s ocean, the effulgence of youth\u2019s moonrise, the great river of passion\u2019s\n\n\u00b9 The Ketaki flower is white, and therefore compared to the moonlight.\n\n\u00b2 The MS. reads -\u0101vac\u016blin\u012b and -pat\u0101keva; we have read iva in both places.\nambrosia, the efflorescence of dalliance's tree, the primer of archness, the moonlight of beauty, the strength of steadfastness, the sanctum of reverence, the nursery garden of biens\u00e9ance, the conference of excellencies, the wisdom of magnanimity, the satiety of youthfulness.\n\n[38] Behind her, mounted on a tall mule, came the bearer of her betel casket, a girl composed, as it were, of flowers, her eyes being long like a string of blue lotus petals, her lips rosy, her teeth gleaming like jasmine blossoms, her arms soft as \u00c7ir\u012b\u1e63a chaplets, her hands delicate as red lotuses, her breath fragrant as Vakula buds, and her aspect bright as the Campaka.'\n\nII.\n\nThe following is the description of Bhairav\u0101c\u0101rya omitted p. 87.\n\n[113] 'Soon amid a great throng of recluses he beheld Bhairav\u0101c\u0101rya, who thus early had bathed, presented the eightfold offering of flowers, and attended to the sacrificial fire. Seated on a tiger-skin, which was stretched on ground smeared with green cow-dung, and whose outline was marked by a boundary ridge of ashes, he was wrapt in a black woollen cloak, as though, apprehending an entrance into an Asura cavern, he were rehearsing a dwelling in the darkness of hell. Like realgar paste purchased by the sale of human flesh\u00b9, his flashing splendour, lurid as lightning, cast a glow upon his disciples. With his hair, knotted at the top and showing the round shells of his rosary hanging from one braided part, he seemed to be imprisoning the saints, who, presuming upon a smattering of knowledge, roamed overhead.\n\n[114] His time of life, marked by a few white hairs, had just passed five-and-fifty years. The hair-line on his skull was giving way to baldness, the orifices of his ears were covered\n\n\u00b9 The manah\u00e7il\u0101 or realgar stone is very precious.\nwith hair, and his forehead broad; while a slanting forehead-\nmark, made with ashes, produced the effect of a white line of\nskull bone burst by the heat of burnt gum repeatedly held\nover half his head\\(^1\\). A natural frown, contracting the interval\nbetween his brows, seemed by the meeting of these to give\nhim one long unbroken line of brow tawny in colour. His very\nlong eyes, somewhat yellow as with \\textit{gutta serena} in the pupils,\nsparkling bright in the centre, and from their red corners\nsending out a film of rays, appeared to trace round him a\nmany-coloured circle like a rainbow, and to shower about the\nparts of space an oblation to \u00c7iva variegated with rows of\nwhite, yellow, and red symbolical marks\\(^2\\). The tip of his nose\nwas curved like the end of Garu\u1e0da\u2019s beak, his cheeks narrowed\nby the wide gash of his mouth, and the outgoing light of his\nteeth, somewhat indented, whitened the stretch of heaven as\nwith the light of the moon, the crest of that \u00c7iva who was\never treasured in his heart. As if overweighted by the whole\n\u00c7aivite canon resting on the tip of his tongue, his lip hung\na little downwards. A pair of crystal earrings, dangling from\nhis pendulous ears, suggested that Venus and Jupiter were\npursuing him in the confidence of acquiring a knowledge\nsurpassing gods and Asuras. Upon one forearm, having an\niron bracelet and bound with the line of a charm-thread of\nvarious herbs, he wore a bit of shell like one of P\u016b\u1e63an\u2019s teeth\nbroken by the holy \u00c7iva and out of devotion converted into\nan ornament. His right hand shook a rosary, like a Persian\nwheel containing the buckets for raising water from the well\nof all delightful emotions. His beard, dangling upon his\nbreast and somewhat tawny at the end, was like a broom\nsweeping away all the dust of passions therein contained.\nCovered with a circle of very thick black hair, his bosom\nseemed scorched by the illumination won through meditation.\nThe ring of a rather loose-hanging wrinkle ran round his\nmiddle: [115] the flesh upon his buttocks swelled out in\nbulk: his girdling loin-cloth was of pure white linen: while\n\n\\(^1\\) For this custom cf. p. 135 \\textit{supra}.\n\n\\(^2\\) R. R. Kale explains this of a rice oblation smeared with yellow\nturmeric and reddish saffron.\ncircling round him in a tight paryanka band was an ascetic's wrap in hue white as ambrosia foam, as if V\u0101suki, manifested by the power of many unfailing charms, were performing the circuit of honour about him. His feet, whose soles were tender like red lotuses, appeared by the clear woven rays which fell from their nails to be crushing hell to pieces in the delight of carrying away its great treasures. They were constantly attended by a pair of pure white water-washed slippers, like a pair of hamsas become intimate with him during his pilgrimage to the holy fords of the Ganges. Constant at his side was a bamboo staff with a barb of iron inserted in the end, which might be compared to a goad for driving away the god whose function it was to remove obstacles to the full attainment of knowledge\\(^1\\). Rarely speaking, slowly smiling; every man's benefactor, and chaste as a boy; supreme in austerities, surpassing in wisdom; restrained in anger, unrestrained in kindness; graced, like a great city, with unfailing native nobility\\(^2\\); delicately tinted\\(^3\\), like Meru, as with the sprays of the Tree of Paradise; like Kail\u0101sa, having his head purified by the dust of Pa\u00e7upati's feet; like \u00c7iva's heaven, the resort of M\u0101he\u00e7vara throngs; like the ocean, cleansed by many a male and female stream; like the Ganges flood, made pure by visiting many a sacred bathing-place: dwelling of dharma, t\u012brtha of truth, storehouse of sincerity, burgh of purity, hall of high character, domain of patience, rice-plot of unassumingness, pedestal of constancy, support of steadfastness, mine of mercy, home of happiness, pleasance of pleasure, palace of propitiousness, mansion of venerableness, congress of refinement, genesis of good feeling, end of evil: such was the holy Bhairav\u0101c\u0101rya, a very \u00c7iva incarnate.\\(^4\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Scil. Ga\u1e47e\u1e63a was himself only an obstacle. But MS. A reads anaparayana 'the not driving away.'\n\n\\(^2\\) R. R. Kale shews that these words contain a pun when applied to 'a great city,' since by P\u0101\u1e47. 6. 2. 89 the word nagara does not lose its accent when compounded (adinaprak\u1e5biti).\n\n\\(^3\\) Ch\u0101y\u0101 contains a pun. Bhairav\u0101c\u0101rya is tinted like, Meru shaded with the sprays.\n\n\\(^4\\)\nAPPENDIX B.\n\nADDITIONAL NOTES AND CORRECTIONS.\n\n(The black figure refers to the page, the plain figure to the line.)\n\n6 8\u201310 For *pattrabha\u1e45gamakarik\u0101* cf. *K\u0101d.* p. 115, l. 15, and for *makarik\u0101* *K\u0101d.* p. 211, l. 14 (*\u015bimantamakarik\u0101*) and below, text, p. 37, ll. 8\u20139 (*c\u016b\u1e0d\u0101ma\u1e47imakarik\u0101*) [Peterson\u2019s 2nd ed.]. The word *makarik\u0101* appears to denote a *makara*-shaped forehead ornament, perhaps with an erotic signification, the *makara* being K\u0101ma\u2019s token. *Pattrabha\u1e45ga* appears to be regularly used of personal ornamentation, probably in the shape of leaves (*vide* text, p. 146, l. 3 with the pun on *patta* and cf. B. and R.): *ap\u0101\u00e7rayapattrabha\u1e45gaputrik\u0101* (text, p. 140, l. 2, cf. also p. 153, l. 18) is in this last respect exceptional.\n\nThe reference to the chess-board in this passage is perhaps due to the fact that one of the Indian chess-men was a *makara* in the sense of being an elephant. *K\u0101la* punningly refers, no doubt, to the *black* army on the chess-board. Thus *kritak\u0101lasannidh\u0101n\u0101m* has three senses, (1) \u2018with the *black* at hand\u2019 of the chess-board, (2) \u2018with Yama at hand\u2019 of the wives of Yama, (3) \u2018with blackness at hand\u2019 of the ascetic\u2019s forehead.\n\n13 20\u20133 The verse contains puns in *akalu\u1e63am\u0101nas\u0101* (\u2018pure of mind\u2019 = Brahm\u0101) and *pa\u1e45kaj\u0101laya* (= abode of Brahm\u0101, cf. B. and R.).\n\n17 1 Or we might read \u2018drinking in,\u2019 as a flower drinks in the sunshine.\n\n17 9 For \u2018heavens\u2019 read \u2018world.\u2019\n\n17 14 For \u2018coral trees\u2019 read \u2018P\u0101rij\u0101ta scent,\u2019 the reference to the Tree of Paradise being merely a pun.\n\n17 28 sqq. Read \u2018for the two ruddy-geese of a loved one\u2019s breasts.\u2019 For the comparison cf. *K\u0101d.* p. 83, ll. 14\u201315. The \u2018sand-bank\u2019 is that surrounding the ocean, cf. p. 160, ll. 1\u20132 *infra.*\n18 19\u201320.

A (*pratiniv\u1e5bitya* \u2018having returned\u2019) is better.\n\n20 2\u20134 Read *\u0101rohati* (for *\u0101ropayati*) with MS. A. *Atinumre* might mean \u2018towards the very courteous.\u2019\n\n20 9\u201310 It will be better to take these words as referring to *Vikuk\u1e63i* \u2018that appears in a favourite of heaven like yourself.\u2019 *Dev\u0101n\u0101mpriya* is similarly employed below, text, p. 268, l. 14.\n\n22 12 Insert \u2018with a lip\u2019 before \u2018wearing etc.\u2019\n\n24 6\u20138 Read \u2018...my misdemeanour, as if committed in a previous birth, has wrought its fruit.\u2019\n\n25 9\u201310 Or more correctly \u2018...high birth is not devoid of true nobility,\u2019 or \u2018through your lord\u2019s nobleness high birth acquires a meaning.\u2019\n\n26 27\u201330 Read \u2018Who am I to grant attention as a favour, or to command body or life? Even without asking the charming and lovely are masters of our all (or \u2018of everyone\u2019).\u2019\n\n27 6\u201312 Some of the puns in this passage are omitted.\n\n27 13\u201314 For \u2018your heart will tell you that\u2019 read \u2018that is honouring oneself,\u2019 and cf. *K\u0101d.* p. 199, ll. 17\u201318.\n\n27 17 \u2018That implies experience\u2019 is probably wrong for *nipu\u1e47opak\u1e63epa\u1e25*, but the correct rendering is not clear. Comparing *K\u0101d.* p. 180, l. 10, we may suggest that it means \u2018a polite insinuation\u2019 or \u2018threat\u2019; for the use of *nipu\u1e47a* cf. also *K\u0101d.* p. 220, l. 8.\n\n29 11\u201312 \u2018Spent that fair night\u2019: literally \u2018wooed that lovely woman.\u2019\n\n29 28 *Bhr\u0101\u1e6dri* is probably a proper name, as Dadhica has no brother, and it would be unnecessary to describe his brother or cousin as a Br\u0101hma\u1e47a. It might mean \u2018foster-brother.\u2019\n\n30 8\u20139 and n. 1 As -k\u016b\u1e6da was a common termination in place names, it will be better to keep the Sanskrit name *P\u1e5bti\u1e45k\u016b\u1e6da*. That this was the name of B\u0101\u1e47a\u2019s home appears below, p. 45.\n\n30 19 For the reference to herons and cats cf. Manu iv. \u00a7 1. 30.

In this sentence we have probably a reference to the facts underlying Hiuen Tsang\u2019s story (Beal, Si-Yu-Ki, i. p. 213) that Har\u1e63a at the advice of a Bodhisattva refrained from mounting the simh\u0101sana or \u2018lion-throne.\u2019 For the lak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101ni clasping his members cf.

In their lives they are \u2018men of mild (or \u2018pure\u2019) ways, believed when they speak, holders of the status of preceptors (or \u2018a high status\u2019), conscientious in speech, weighty owing to their application to virtue, and renowned for goodness.\u2019 In their studies they are \u2018expounders of texts, devoted to exegesis, engaged upon difficult words, logicians, deep in the study of able works, and averse to all infelicitous language.\u2019 For similar passages cf. C. I. I. iii. p. 175, J. R. A. S. (Bomb.), x. p. 78, ll. 32\u20133, Epigr.

By Sand\u0101sa, the murderer, the earth was confounded. Nala, inadequately skilled in dicing, was overcome by Kali\u2026. K\u0101rtav\u012brya was slain for persecuting a Br\u0101hma\u1e47 by reason of his cows. Marutta\u2026was not highly honoured by the Br\u0101hma\u1e47 of the gods.\u2019 The alternatives should go in the notes.\n\n75 12 Vane punningly means \u2018in the water\u2019 and madanaras\u0101vi\u1e63\u1e6do \u2018drunk with Madana juice.\u2019\n\n76 8\u201310 This passage refers, as B\u00fchler has shown (Ind.

A has *caranavikuttana*, doubtless the right reading, confirming our conjecture: cf. *K\u0101d.* p. 73, l. 19\n113 18 Or perhaps \u2018the soft ring of the brazen gong was clearly heard.\u2019\n\n114 15 We read utsavayantyo with MS. A.\n\n117 12 Daks\u012b\u1e47a \u2018courtly\u2019 also means by a pun \u2018southern.\u2019\n\n117 18 For \u2018gateway\u2019 read \u2018structure.\u2019\n\n117 25 The word kritayugayogyau has two senses, (1) \u2018fit for the K\u1e5bita age,\u2019 (2) \u2018taking exercise together.\u2019\n\n119 14 \u2018Unwatched\u2019: or \u2018considerately treated.\u2019\n\n119 23 Or \u2018M\u0101lwa nobles,\u2019 but cf. p. 66, l. 7.\n\n119 n. 1 K\u1e63udr\u0101\u1e45k also has two senses, (1) \u2018mean persons,\u2019 (2) \u2018small.\u2019\n\n120 28 The red \u0100ml\u0101taka flower is punningly compared to loyalty; anur\u0101ga = (1) \u2018redness,\u2019 (2) \u2018loyalty.\u2019\n\n121 5 and n. 1 For \u2018dignity\u2019 read \u2018fairness.\u2019\n\n121 6\u20138 This noble\u2019s glory is \u2018going forth\u2019 in the sense of \u2018spreading abroad,\u2019 cf. p. 90, ll. 4\u20135 supra.\n\n122 13 Gunavatt\u0101 might be translated \u2018the possession of attributes\u2019: the Kashmir text has an easier reading gunavritt\u0101 \u2018as if become an attribute,\u2019 with doubtless puns in guna and vritta. Cint\u0101 would be better rendered by \u2018anxiety.\u2019\n\n122 33 Dhara\u1e47idhar\u0101\u1e47\u0101m = (1) \u2018royal houses,\u2019 (2) (with reference to \u00c7iva\u2019s footprint) \u2018hills.\u2019 The word m\u0101he\u00e7vara doubtless implies that the Mukharas were, like Har\u1e63a himself, \u00c7ivaites.\n\n123 10\u201311 The reading of MS. A (yath\u0101 neyam) gives better sense \u2018that all our lives she may incur no trouble, \u2019tis for my lord to provide.\u2019 A. reads \u0101cit\u0101m (?), the Calc. ed. n\u0101dhit\u0101m, and, in a note, \u0101rttit\u0101m.\n\n124 21 Saras\u0101tarpanahast\u0101 means \u2018hand-marks of liquid pigment,\u2019 if the Comm. rightly explains \u0101tarpa\u1e47a as pi\u1e63\u1e6dapapa\u00f1c\u0101\u1e45gula, for which cf. p. 123 n., and compare nihitaraktacandanahasta K\u0101d. p. 224, ll. 16\u201317, and \u0101tarpanapapa\u00f1c\u0101\u1e45gulayah, V\u0101savadatt\u0101 p. 183, l. 3.\n\n124 35 The reference is to the vi\u00e7e\u1e63aka or \u2018beauty-spot.\u2019\n\n125 6 Bhakti we have translated \u2018cutting\u2019 in accordance with the Comm., who explains it by vicchitti: we might translate \u2018adorning,\u2019 a sense which both bhakti and vicchitti will bear.\nThe sense is not quite clear; with our transl. cf. Ind. Ant. xiii. p. 77, l. 7 of inscr.; we might compare Raghu V. xvii. 25 hamsacihnaduk\u0101lav\u0101n with S. P. Pandit's note: MS. A has -hamsatulai\u00e7a (?= 'beds of goose down').\n\nYauvar\u0101jye exactly\u2014an installation of the heir to the throne, a time of great jubilation.\n\nSc. red lotuses.\n\nFor mukhena patati in this sense cf. K\u0101d. p. 35, l. 6 (with Peterson's note) and p. 38, l. 2.\n\nLa\u1e45ghayan means\u2014punningly\u2014'leaping over' (of the lotus beds).\n\nRead Rati (sic).\n\nThe reading of MS. A adhomukh\u012bm gives better sense 'while with downcast face she seemed to chide her friends and heart etc.'; cf. p. 120, ll. 25\u20136.\n\nWe have puns in sudh\u0101=(1) 'plaster,' (2) 'ambrosia,' and bh\u0101bhrid=(1) 'mountain,' (2) 'king.'\n\nRead 'enemies' faces' (sic). We should perhaps translate 'enemies' faces with coloured masks.' Also sekasukum\u0101ra may mean 'oil-besprent,' and the words 'which had' ought perhaps to be omitted. We have taken the instrumentals as connected with a\u00f1jalik\u0101rik\u0101hi\u1e25.\n\nThe 'night bowl' nidr\u0101kala\u1e47a is no doubt employed as a charm at the bed's head; cf. K\u0101d. p. 68, l. 7, p. 178, l. 14.\n\nThe red eyes of the cakora are referred to below, p. 170, n. 2 and also K\u0101d. p. 140, l. 6, Raghu-V. vii. 22.\n\nRead 'to have his horse (or 'the horses') saddled.'\n\nOr 'young devotees' or 'squires,' 'apprentices': the word navasevaka appears to have a semi-technical sense, cf. p. 200, l. 22 and K\u0101d. 76, l. 20, p. 207, l. 6, p. 331, l. 16.\n\nIt would be possible here to read 'their dry mouths' and 'their cravings.'\n\n\u00c7al\u0101k\u0101 is explained by Kail\u0101s c. as 'collyrium stick': the Comm. says p\u0101\u015b\u0101\u1e47ak\u0101\u1e47ik\u0101\u1e25 'bits of stone.'\n\nRead 'porous jar.'\n\nThe Sanskrit sentences may here be differently divided:\u2014\n\n'I know, my boy, your filial affection. At times like this an over tender heart distracts even a sober man's mind. Hard to resist is family affection, all-confounding.'\n\nFor 'fathers' read 'parents.'\n\nFor 'pallid' read 'parched.'\n151 n. 2 MS. A has *kulaputrai\u1e25 \u1e63vasitai\u00e7ca*.\n\n154 21 Read \u2018glory, of\u2019 (sic).\n\n154 n. 1 Query *vanam v\u0101pi*?\n\n155 n. 1 Read *uparirudhyam\u0101na* (sic).\n\n158 19\u201321 Place comma after *manorath\u0101n\u0101m* and read \u2018the paths of men\u2019s desires are sundered, their Eldorados are laid desolate etc.\u2019 Cf. *K\u0101d.* p. 312, l. 23 *bhagn\u0101 panth\u0101no gu\u1e47\u0101n\u0101m*, and the whole passage.\n\n159 30 For \u2018humps\u2019 read \u2018frontal globes.\u2019\n\n159 n. 5 MS. A has *prabha\u1e6dasamaye* and *samucciyam\u0101n\u0101su*. Read *samucciyam\u0101n\u0101su* (sic) in note.\n\n160 14 \u2018With eyes aflame\u2019; sc. the prince could not bear to look upon the objects which met his view.\n\n160 n. 1 *\u00c7\u016bva* = (1) grey, (2) belonging to a corpse.\n\n161 27\u20138 Or better \u2018made bright the afterglow of their love.\u2019\n\n161 n. 1 MS. A has *babha\u00f1ju\u1e25*.\n\n163 12 Read \u2018love.\u2019\n\n164 6\u20139 Rather \u2018As the twang of the broken sapling, by robbing the lion of his sleep, redounds to the elephant\u2019s own destruction, So, by awaking a hero\u2019s wrath, to the villain\u2019s own ruin turns the foul blow dealt upon the confiding.\u2019\n\n167 7 and n. 2 *K\u0101lakramopacay\u0101n\u0101m* is probably right after all, cf. *K\u0101d.* 176, l. 20; the impossibility of gradual increase implies the sudden intensity of the sorrow.\n\n167 31 sqq. The Sanskrit has here a complicated simile; the prince\u2019s washed face and throbbing lip are compared to the autumn sky at the close of the rains, when the lightning has almost ceased, his white eye to the opening lotuses. MS. A has *jijay\u1e63ateva*.\n\n168 26 \u00c7\u016br\u012b, the goddess of sovereignty, is roaming, sc. not yet settled with a new king. The paragraph contains several significant allusions (\u2018the pathetic fallacy\u2019). The red sunset is a sign of bloody wars; the separation of the ruddy-geese of the separation of the brothers; the buzzing bees of arrows; the rise of the blotted moon of the rising power of the Gau\u1e0da king. The last is important as the word used for the moon (*\u00c7a\u1e45\u1e45ka*) confirms the Comm.\u2019s statement in p. 195 (text) that this was the Gau\u1e0da king\u2019s name (Hiuen Thsang\u2019s Che-chang-kia). One MS. of the Har\u1e63a-Carita names him Narendra-Gupta, v. B\u00fchler *Epigr. Ind.* i. p. 70.\n169 7\u20138 'Softened etc.'; this however may go with 'you,' after 'tractable.'\n\n170 15\u201318 MS. A reads corruptly -kritapa\u1e6d\u0101vagun\u1e6dhan\u012bjanadrum\u0101\u1e45gan\u0101m iva, and nir\u0101kartum for tyaktum. The reading jana\u1e45gam\u0101\u1e45gan\u0101m is probably the right one, as the conception of \u010cri as a C\u0101\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101la woman runs through this speech and its reply.\n\n170 n. 5 Guror contains a second sense 'an elder's will.'\n\n171 14\u201315 Read 'freed from fear by my sire's death.' Sc. Puspabh\u016bti had held it in check.\n\n172 n. 3 The meaning might be 'Why not take the sovereignty\u2014worn out as it is\u2014with you?' But R\u0101jyavardhana had himself compared \u010cri to old age.\n\n173 30 The M\u0101lwa king is identified by B\u00fchler with the Devagupta of the Madhuban Inscr. (Epigr. Ind. i. p. 72), and K\u0101nyakubja he regards as Grahavarman's capital. M\u0101lwa may, he says, be the M\u0101lwa in the Punjab near Th\u0101nesar.\n\n174 12 Or perhaps the river writhes with K\u0101liya's brood.\n\n174 16\u201320 The hand is here compared to a spray (pallava) used for sprinkling water. The 'sweat' in the next sentence is a common Hindu erotic idea.\n\n176 1 For 'you desire' read 'it desires.'\n\n177 n. 2 MS. A here agrees with the Kashmir rendering, which should be adopted 'which, breached within and timid through brotherly affection, seemed as it were in flight.' The reading is confirmed by antarbhinnah\u1e5bidayatv\u0101t, K\u0101d. p. 273, l. 18.\n\n180 24 The sen\u0101pati had really risen from a bed of reeds (cara). Cf. V\u0101savadatt\u0101, p. 297, l. 9.\n\n183 2 For 'his' read 'this.'\n\n183 7 Rather 'dream of aught dishonourable.'\n\n183 19 The serpent \u010ce\u1e63a supports merely the earth (not the oceans) and does not enjoy the earth (v. next sentence).\n\n185 8 Cak\u1e63ur\u0101ga appears to be a technical word with an amatory sense, as it occurs in similar passages below, p. 283, l. 11 (text) and K\u0101d. p. 41, l. 1.\n\n186 22\u201325 and n. 2 The notion in this sentence is that Bh\u012bma is pleased with the taste of carnage, since it is sweetened by the kisses of his demon wife.\nThe title *sandhivighah\u0101dikrita* besides *vy\u0101pritasandhivigraha* and *sandhivigrahika* is found also on inscriptions, e.g. *C. I. I.* iii. pp. 10, 35, 104, 108, 128, 167; *Ind. Ant.* xiii. pp. 84, 118; *J. R. A. S.* (Bomb.) x. p. 27; *Epigr. Ind.* i. p. 88, l. 50.\n\nThe Kashmir text inserts *iti* after *par\u0101gato'ham*, perhaps to mark the end of the quotation. We ought apparently to translate *par\u0101gato'ham* by 'I am arrived,' cf. *K\u0101d.* p. 262, l. 13, p. 264, l. 11, and our text, p. 243, l. 3.\n\nWe may better take *suciram* with *ruditam* 'I have not abandoned myself for long even to tears.'\n\nSkandagupta is probably the same person whom Har\u1e63a names on the Madhuban Inscr., *Epigr. Ind.* i. p. 73.\n\nTake 'uplifted' with 'thickets.' With reference to the Vindhya this compound means 'with bamboos, creepers, woods, and thickets adorned with peacocks' tails.'\n\nOmit the note.\n\nIt would be possible with Dr Bhau Dh\u0101ji to render *cail\u016b\u1e63amadhyam adhy\u0101sy\u0101* by 'having joined a company of actors.'\n\nRead *abhij\u0101tyasya.*\n\nWe have here omitted *Cand\u012bpati\u1e25* (which might mean 'lord of Cand\u012b,' so Hall) with the Kashmir text and read *\u00c7ai\u00e7un\u0101gi\u1e25* with MS. A. *Kan\u1e6dha\u00e7a* is read by MS. A and the Kashmir text. MS. A reads *ak\u0101ryakut\u016bha\u1e6di* 'curious where he should not be.'\n\nMSS. AB have 'Mount Govardhana.'\n\nMekala is part of the Vindhya Mountains.\n\nRead 'the Pau\u1e47aki prince' (MS. A has *Pau\u1e47ika*).\n\nThe Kashmir text and the Comm. read Dadhna.\n\nConcerning *asuravivara* and *v\u0101tika* cf. note on p. 33 supra.\n\nWe might translate 'ensconced in a reed grove with an uplifted thicket of reeds in their hands.'\n\nFor 'sweet-toothed' read 'drunken.' Dr Bhau Dh\u0101ji's MS. apparently read *madhumoditamadhuraka-* in one word. For *madhuraka* MS. A has *madhurasa.*\n\nProbably MS. A is here right in reading *J\u0101r\u016bthy\u0101m* 'in J\u0101r\u016bth\u012b.'\n\nRead -k\u0101lad\u016btatadri\u1e63\u1e6dayah.\n198 7\u201310 We have here read *sa\u1e43vibhajya klis\u1e6dak\u0101rpatikakulaputra-lokam ucitai\u1e25 pras\u0101dad\u0101nair, vimucya bandhan\u0101ni.*\n\n198 24 The word *\u0101k\u1e63ap\u0101\u1e6dalika* \u2018one in charge of ak\u1e63ap\u0101\u1e6dala i.e. documents\u2019 occurs frequently on inscriptions, cf. *C. I. I.* III. p. 180, l. 76 and p. 190, n. 2. We have a \u2018notary-in-chief\u2019 (*mah\u0101k\u1e63ap\u0101\u1e6dalika*) id. p. 177, l. 46, and a \u2018village notary\u2019 (*gram\u0101k\u1e63ap\u0101\u1e6dal\u0101dhik\u1e5bita*) id. p. 257, l. 15. *Mah\u0101k\u1e63ap\u0101\u1e6dal\u0101dhikara\u1e47\u0101dhik\u1e5bita* occurs on Har\u1e63a\u2019s Inscr., *Epigr. Ind.* I. p. 73.\n\n199 17 For *bal\u0101dhik\u1e5bita* cf. *C. I. I.* III. pp. 109 n., 210 n.; *K\u0101d.* p. 331, l. 14.\n\n199 22 Read *ka\u1e6dukaka\u1e6duka*. For *ka\u1e6duka* = \u2018officer\u2019 cf. text, p. 250, l. 4.\n\n200 22 On *navasevaka* v. note on p. 135, l. 30 supra.\n\n200 27\u20138 The apes are carried for superstitious reasons (*rak\u1e63\u0101rtham*), Comm.\n\n200 n. 3 The sense of *j\u0101ghanika* is uncertain: possibly it means \u2018debauchee,\u2019 cf. *jaghangya*. We translate *j\u0101ghan\u012bkara*.\n\n200 n. 4 The translation suggested in the notes is supported by *K\u0101d.* p. 88, ll. 4\u20135, p. 97, l. 21, p. 191, ll. 2\u20133, p. 212, l. 17 etc., and *supra* p. 106, l. 6.\n\n200 n. 5 *N\u0101\u015bira* means \u2018vanguard,\u2019 *K\u0101d.* p. 331, l. 14, which confirms the meaning \u2018vanguard\u2019 here.\n\n201 28 MS. A reads *trastavesara* \u2013 \u2018frightened mules.\u2019\n\n202 5 *Antar\u0101sana* \u2018the inner seat\u2019 occurs in a similar passage, *K\u0101d.* p. 112, l. 5. Perhaps the sense is \u2018a near seat.\u2019\n\n202 n. 1 MS. A has *tilaka*.\n\n203 21 Read \u2018inlaid ruby\u2019 for \u2018ruby inlaid at its top,\u2019 as *upari* goes with *dhriyam\u0101\u1e47ena*.\n\n204 n. 2 We have followed MS. A: otherwise it would have been necessary to read *dra\u1e63\u1e6drin* for *dra\u1e63\u1e6drin\u0101m*.\n\n205 5 Read \u2018palace peacocks,\u2019 and for the idea cf. *K\u0101d.* p. 183, ll. 6\u20137.\n\n205 16 \u2018Spread\u2019: for *tast\u0101ra* intransitive cf. *K\u0101d.* p. 76, l. 21, p. 368, l. 11. MS. A has *tat\u0101ra*.\n\n206 4\u20136 We have read *haritakrit\u0101\u1e25* for *haritikrit\u0101\u1e25*: MS. A has *harin\u0101m krit\u0101\u1e25*.\n\n207 2 For \u2018old fellow\u2019 read \u2018standstill.\u2019\n\n208 16 \u2018The whole body of nobles\u2019: or *asa\u1e43vibhakta* might mean \u2018the not specially provided nobles.\u2019\n'Fools of grant-holders': \u0101grah\u0101rika occurs on inscriptions in the sense of 'an officer in special charge of an agrah\u0101ra,' C. I. I. iii. p. 52, n. 2, p. 257, l. 12.\n\n\u0100yuktaka is a regular word for 'official' on inscriptions, e.g. C. I. I. iii. p. 166, l. 20: we have \u0101yuktapuru\u1e63a, id. p. 8. C\u0101\u1e6da 'knave' is the word which Fleet renders (C. I. I. iii. p. 98 n.) by 'irregular soldiers.' MS. A has ce\u1e6da.\n\nHere (Bombay ed. p. 238, l) the texts read uddh\u016byam\u0101nadh\u016bli-patalam kvacid ekantaprav\u1e5btt\u014dcavav\u0101racakracarvayam\u0101nag\u0101migau\u1e0da vim\u1e5bigayam\u0101nasasyasamrak\u1e63anam, which as far as gau\u1e0da recurs below, continuing with -vigraham. It is clear that in the first passage only m\u1e5bigayam\u0101nasasyasamrak\u1e63anam is needed. The repetition must be due to some homoeoteleuton (perhaps abhidadh\u0101nair and dh\u0101vam\u0101nair). The MS. A is here right and reads -carcyam\u0101n\u0101-.\n\n'Ripe': we read n\u012bpanna with Comm. and the Kashmir text.\n\n'Collisions': or sa\u1e45gha\u1e6d\u1e6da may mean 'races,' as supra text, p. 65, l. 3.\n\nFor this custom of touching on the back cf. K\u0101d. p. 230, l. 19, p. 335, ll. 9\u201310 and Hiuen Thsang, Si-Yu-Ki (Beal), l. p. 85; (Julien) i. 86.\n\nThere is doubtless a pun in danta, implying that the umbrella has circles of ivory. For ma\u1e47\u1e0dalaka MS. A has ma\u1e47\u1e0daladyuti.\n\n'And of the hue etc.': the Sanskrit adjective may here go with the next clause. The Kashmir text in this line reads the adjective \u0101gurava-.\n\n'Rushed towards': or perhaps 'fled from,' as the gandhadvipa is a terror to all other elephants. The Moon in l. 18 refers to Ga\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101\u1e45ka, the Gau\u1e0da king (cf. sup. note on p. 168).\n\nThe 'ladies' are the wives of Har\u1e63a's enemies, whose lands are soon to be seized.\n\nVimuktasarv\u0101ca may punningly mean 'abandoning all hope.'\n\nHiuen Thsang visits Bh\u0101skaravarman, king of K\u0101mar\u016bpa.\n\nMS. A also has k\u1e63\u0101layatu, which is to be preferred.\n\nOr perhaps 'What any more can torment my noble master, thus addressed by your majesty?'\n\nAfter 'daughter' insert a comma.\n\nWe might here translate 'he worships men's feet even with his words, uncontented with his head alone.'\nlast line 'A hedgehog': or 'polecat.'\n\nn. 5 Or 'an uncounted hell.'\n\n9 We have translated par\u0101gata\u1e25 by 'died' (cf. pareta) because the ambassador comes from the Kum\u0101ra. But v. note on p. 188, l. 7 supra. We might translate 'the king of Assam will arrive in a few days' or 'has come home only a few days' or 'for a few days.'\n\n32\u20133 Read 'dangled as his sole remaining ornament his charm bracelet,' comparing S. P. Pandit's note to Vikramorva\u00e7i, p. 84.\n\nn. 3 For the instrumental \u0101tman\u0101\u2014'on his own part' cf. K\u0101d. p. 25, l. 16, p. 163, l. 15, p. 340, l. 2 etc.\n\nlast line 'Zealous' is our translation of yantrita; but the Kashmir text has ayanrita, which probably means 'furious,' literally 'unrestrained'; cf. B. and R. MS. A reads av\u012b\u1e63\u1e6dagop\u0101lakalpita.\n\n20 'Dust of travellers' stamping feet': for this use of prasphotita (the dust flying out) in almost the same word cf. K\u0101d. p. 223, l. 15 k\u0101rpa\u1e6dikaprasphotitacaranaadh\u0101lidh\u0101sarakisalayal\u0101\u00f1chitopaka\u1e47\u1e6dha\u1e45hi.\n\n11 Or 'white skeletons.'\n\n10 We have accidentally omitted the concluding sentence 'There the king stayed,' or with MS. A 'There the king passed the day.'\n\n13 According to Dr Bhau Dh\u0101ji (J. R. A. S. Bomb. x. p. 40) the Maitr\u0101ya\u1e47iya Br\u0101hmans are still found at Bhadgaon and in neighbouring villages near the Satpuda Mts.\n\n29\u2013235 5 Part of this passage recurs nearly verbatim, V\u0101savadatt\u0101 (Hall), p. 263, l. 4\u2013p. 266, l. 3.\n\n8 The ke\u00e7alu\u00f1cana ascetics appear to be mentioned Si-Yu-Ki (Beal) i. p. 76; (Julien) i. 69.\n\n31 The Kashmir text has patitapind\u0101, and MS. A pratipind\u0101, which would support the rendering 'taking food with an effort shown at every mouthful.'\n\nn. 11 Cf. pa\u00f1camandali C. I. I. iii. p. 31, l. 6. Pa\u00f1cakula is the title of an office, Epigr. Ind. i. pp. 160, 170; cf. Ind. Ant. xi. p. 221, l. 21, p. 242, l. 9.\n\n30 'In the night': but MS. A has a better reading g\u0101tri\u1e63u 'in those who have bodies,' to be taken with mah\u0101bh\u016btagr\u0101ma-go\u1e63\u1e6dhyah.\nINDEX OF PROPER NAMES, ETC.\n\nI.\n\nAcyuta, a relative of B\u0101\u1e47a, 31\nAdhipati, cousin of B\u0101\u1e47a, 73\n\u0100dhyar\u0101ja, a poet?, 3 cl. 18 and n. 3\nAgimitra, a king, 192\nAhidatta, uncle of B\u0101\u1e47a, 32\nArthapati, grandfather of B\u0101\u1e47a, 31\nAvalokita, 58, 237\nAvanti, 187\nAvantivarman, 122\n\nB\u0101\u1e47a, 32\u201479 passim\nBhadrasena, a king, 193\nBhairavac\u0101rya, an ascetic, c. iii. 85\u2014 , 263\nBhandi, cousin and friend of Har\u1e63a, 116, 135, 142, 175, 223\u20144\nBh\u0101sa, a poet, 2 cl. 15\nBh\u0101skaradyuti, Kum\u0101ra of Assam, 217\nBh\u0101skaravarman=foreg., 217\nBhrigu, uncle of B\u0101\u1e47a, 32\nBh\u016bkampa, a \u010cabara king, 232\nBh\u016btivarman, a king of Assam, 217\nB\u1e5bhiadratha, (1) a king, 192; (2) a king, 193\nBuddha, 58, 66, 245, 258\n\nCandragupta, the famous, 194\nCandraketu, a king, 193\nCandramukhavarman, a king of Assam, 217\nCaura, a poet?, 1 cl. 6\nCitrabh\u0101nu, B\u0101\u1e47a\u2019s father, 32\n\nDadhra, a king, 193\nDadhna, var. lect. for preceding, 193\nDevabh\u016bti, a king, 193\nDevak\u012b, a queen, 194\nDevasena, a king, 194\nDharma, uncle of B\u0101\u1e47a, 32\nDiv\u0101karamitra, a recluse, 233 sqq.\n\nGambh\u012bra, a Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, 128\nGanapati, (1) cousin of B\u0101\u1e47a, 73, 78; (2) a king, 193\nGrahavarman, brother-in-law of Har\u1e63a, 122, 123, 128, 173, 233, 238\nGu\u1e47\u0101dhya, author of the V\u1e5bihat-kath\u0101, 3 n. 3\nGupta, a noble, 224, 251\n\nH\u0101la, author of the Sapta\u00e7ataka, 2 n. 10\nHamsa, uncle of B\u0101\u1e47a, 32\nHamsavat\u012b, a queen, 194\nHamsavega, envoy from Assam, 211, 223\nHara, relative of B\u0101\u1e47a, 31\nHaricandra, an author, 2 cl. 12\nHar\u1e63a, cc. 2, 4\u20148 passim\nHar\u1e63a\u2019s son, 76 n. 5\n\n\u012ac\u0101na, relative of B\u0101\u1e47a, 31\nJagatpati, friend of B\u0101\u1e47a, 46\nJ\u0101r\u016btha, a king?
