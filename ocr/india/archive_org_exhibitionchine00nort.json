The prominent masters are Wu-tao-tzu, the greatest of Chinese painters; Li-ssu-hsin, the founder of the northern school of landscape painters; and Wang-wei, the painter of romantic landscapes of the southern school.\n\nFive Dynasties 900-960\n\nSung Dynasty 960-1280\n\nThis, the classical period of Chinese painting, is characterized by grandeur of conception, simplicity of style and power of interpreting the soul of nature. The most famous names are Li-ying-ch'iu, landscapes full of soul; Tung-yuan, rainy landscapes; Li-lung-mien, religious subjects; Su-tung-po, bamboo sketches in black and white; Mi-fei, landscapes; Emperor Sung-hui-tsung, birds, especially falcons; Chao-po-k\u00fc, human figures and landscapes; Mu-chi, tigers; Ma-yuan and Hsia-kuei, landscapes.\n\nYuan Dynasty 1280-1368\n\nThis period has not the grandeur of conception of the Sung. Its paintings are of a more delicate and idyllic style. The most noted artists are Chao-tzu-ting, horses and landscapes; Chien-hsian, human figures, flowers and birds; Huang-kung-wang, Kao-ko-kung and Waug-meng, landscapes.\n\nMing Dynasty 1368-1644\n\nThis is the romantic period. The composition is in general not centralized. There is growing individuality of style. The objects depicted are full of spirit and life. Amongst more than twelve hundred artists there are T'ang-yin, the most famous of all Ming painters; Ch'i-ting-ying, the distinguished copyist; Sh\u00ean-chou, landscapes; W\u00ean-cheng-ming, the great colourist, in landscapes; L\u00fc-ki, famous for flowers and birds; Tung-ch'i-ch'ang, foremost in landscapes; Lu-pao-shan, flowers and birds and landscapes; and Ting-y\u00fcn-p'\u00eang, landscapes, figures and portraits.\nTs'ing Dynasty 1644-1912\n\nThe Kang-hsi paintings superficially looked at somewhat resemble those of the Sung period, but they lack the soul of the sublime paintings of that classic period. In the Chien-lung and the later periods there are many talented masters, but their ability seems to be of a technical nature and their works give the impression of decorative art.\n\nKANG-HSI. 1662-1723 The famous artists are the four Wangs, especially Wang-shih-ku; Y\u00fcn-nan-t'ien, as a flower painter; Sin-lo-shan-j\u00f6n, for flowers and birds and Ch'a-shih-piao for landscapes.\n\nYUNG-CHENG. 1723-1736. Kao-chi-p'ei, a famous finger painter.\n\nCHIEN-LUNG. 1736-1796. Tung-pang-ta, landscapes; Pien-shou-min, geese and ducks.\n\nKIA-CHING. 1796-1821. Min-chen, scenes of life, flowers and birds.\n\nTAO-KUANG. 1821-1851 Wang-hsiao-meo, a famous copyist.\n\nPRESENT PERIOD. 1851-1912.\n\nGeneral Note\n\nIn ascribing a painting to a certain artist, as the Collector has done in the following descriptive list, he would observe, as is well known, that Chinese experts consider the inscription upon a painting and even the use of the seal of the artist to whom the painting is ascribed as indicating not so much its authenticity as its fidelity to the style of the artist named.\nThe Paintings\n\nTang Dynasty 600-900\n\n1 Wang-wei \u738b\u7dad Spring landscape\n\nIn the foreground willow trees, a summer-house, a creek and a fisherman plying his trade; in the background a gigantic range of mountains. The picture is full of \"Stimmung\"; it is a good example of Wang-wei's art. Chinese writers say that Wang-wei's pictures were like poems and his poems like pictures.\n\nThe picture bears at the top lengthy inscriptions by Chao-tzu-ang, Tung-chi-chang, W\u00ean-ch\u00eang-ming and Wang-shih-ku, which seem to be genuine. Of the originally vivid green colours of the mountains dark green shades only are left.\n\n2 Wu-tao-tzu \u5433\u9053\u5b50 Mythological scene\n\nIt must be regarded as an impossible thing to find any genuine pictures by Wu-tao-tzu in China, except perhaps in the imperial collections. This copy seems to be a rather old one, at least early Ming; but it is in a hopeless condition. It consists only of hundreds of pieces, the colours are almost completely lost and no more of Wu-tao-tzu's art can be seen than that the figures were done exceedingly well. The inscriptions at the top are illegible.\n\n3 Wu-tao-tzu \u5433\u9053\u5b50 A country house in the mountains\n\nAttributed to Wu-tao-tzu, but a Tang or early Sung copy. A country-house leans against a steep mountain slope, pines, a lake, a girl in a boat, a waterfall and rocky peaks in the background. Judging from this specimen of his art one can understand why Wu-tao-tzu is known as the greatest of Chinese painters.\nFive Dynasties 900-960\n\n4 Han-hsi \u97d3\u7199\n   A temple in a mountain valley\n   Copy made in the Ts'ing Dynasty. Interesting as showing a transition from Tang to Sung style.\n\nSung Dynasty 960-1280\n\n5 Kuo-hsi \u90ed\u7199\n   Spring landscape in Szechuan\n   Kang-hsi copy. The mountains, the water and the trees are very well executed, but the animals are without life and clumsy.\n\n6 Kuo-hsi \u90ed\u7199\n   Spring landscape\n   Copy, probably late Ming. Charming scenery. The nervous brushwork points to the late Ming period.\n\n7 Li-i'ang \u674e\u5510\n   Cloudy mountain scenery\n   Painted on paper with gold ground, partly touched up, especially in white. The contrast between the green of the gigantic mountain-ranges and the white of the clouds and the water-fall is very effective; indeed the picture might be called a symphony in gold, green and white.\n\n8 Wang-hsien \u738b\u8a75\n   Lan-tchai-ho, a genius, walking over the waves\n   In black and white on silk. Note the quiet lines in the graceful figure contrasting with the lively lines of the agitated sea.\n\n9 Li-ying-ch'iu \u674e\u54b8\u7199\n   Winter landscape\n   This painting shows in a remarkable way the disinterested love of nature which was typical of the Sung painters. It shows also their unsurpassed power of interpreting the soul of nature. A grandeur of conception dominates notwithstanding the delicacy of the details. The entire atmosphere of the painting is full of peace. This is among the best landscapes of the collection.\n\n10 Tung-y\u00fcan \u8463\u6e90\n    A rainy landscape\n    Very delicate work, approaching the Y\u00fcan style.\n11 Li-kung-lin \u674e\u516c\u9e9f\n\nKang-hsi copy probably. A palace seen within the mist; sun sinking behind steep rocks; the god of longevity coming through the air on a heron. The faces and figures of the immortals are very well done also the palace and the whole background; but the rock in the middle-distance is without character, while the trees in the foreground have no life.\n\n12 Su-tung-po \u8607\u6771\u5761\n\nA modern copy, the beauty of which lies in the various shades of black ink.\n\n13 Mi-fei \u7c73\u82be\n\nRainy landscape\n\n14 Sung-hui-tsung \u5b8b\u5fbd\u5b97\n\nWhite falcon tied to a rock\n\nGenuine Sung-hui-tsungs are not readily found. This is a recent imitation done with the remarkable skill of the Chinese in forging old pictures.\n\n15 Sung-hui-tsung \u5b8b\u5fbd\u5b97\n\nAn eagle looking from a rock in the sea\n\nThe inscription says that this is a copy by Pien-ching-chao, Y\u00fcan Dynasty, after an original by Sung-hui-tsung, but it must be a modern copy after Pien-ching-chao's copy. This and the preceding number give a good idea of Sung-hui-tsung's famous art of painting birds.\n\n16 Ching-hao \u8d99\u6d69\n\nAutumn landscape\n\nAlthough spoiled to a considerable extent it has not lost much of its original effect. The massive mountains are painted with an unusually powerful brush.\n\n17 Yang-wu-ch'iu \u694a\u7121\u548e\n\nPine-tree, bamboo and larch blossoms in the moonshine\n\nIt is apparently only a small part of an originally much larger picture, but it has a charm difficult to describe and it is in the best style of the great Sung masters.\n\n18 Chao-po-ku \u8d99\u4f2f\u99d2\n\nSummer in the high mountains\n\nExcellent composition, fine colouring, especially the blue of the mountains. Full of the spirit of Sung art.\n19 Chao-po-k\u00fc \u8d99\u4f2f\u99d2 Emperor Min-wang and the goddess of the moon\n\nThe goddess surrounded by five girl companions drives in a two-wheeled carriage drawn by a phoenix through the clouds. The Emperor and the three other beings standing in the air look up to her. Simple composition and very refined colouring. This painting has the charm of the old legends.\n\n20 Ma-y\u00fcan \u99ac\u9060 The eighteen Lohans\n\nPossibly a Kang-hsi copy, if not a quite modern falsification. The whole is very well executed.\n\n21 Ma-y\u00fcan \u99ac\u9060 Rain among the mountains\n\n22 Chao-ta-nin \u8d99\u5927\u5e74 Mountain scenery\n\nAn imposing cone-shaped mountain having in the foreground two very fine firs.\n\n23 T'ung-kuan \u7ae5\u8cab A sage enjoying the beauty of a lake\n\nA copy of the Ming period. This picture is poetry materialized.\n\n24 Hsia-kuei \u590f\u73ea The minister Sih-s\u00fc retiring into isolation\n\nBroad style showing a countryhouse among lofty mountains.\n\n25 Yen-tzu-ping \u95bb\u6b21\u5e73 The island of happiness\n\nThe mythical land where gold has no value and the people live in everlasting happiness.\n\n26 Pei-loh-tien \u767d\u6a02\u5929 Ti-kwa-li, one of the eight Genii\n\n27 Li-ti \u674e\u8fea The Si-hu or West Lake at Hangchow\n\nProbably a Ts'ing copy.\n\n28 Ku-chung-chiao \u9867\u4ef2\u7199 Two herons\n\nA Kang-hsi copy.\n\n29 Wu-huai \u5433\u61f7 A dragon\n\nA Ming copy. Wu-huai was a most famous dragon painter. Note the beautiful shades of black and white and the powerful design of the animal.\nY\u00fcan Dynasty 1280-1368\n\n30 Chao-tzu-ang \u8d99\u5b50\u6602\n   A hundred horses\n   Probably a Ming copy. Very fine composition.\n\n31 Chao-tzu-ang \u8d99\u5b50\u6602\n   A horse whipped by his keeper\n   Probably Ts'ing copy. Observe the ferocity of the head of the horse.\n   The painting shows why Chao-tzu-ang is called the most famous horse\n   painter after Han-kan of the Tang Dynasty.\n\n32 Chao-tzu-ang \u8d99\u5b50\u6602\n   An emperor hunting a deer\n   Chien-lung copy.\n\n33 Chao-tzu-ang \u8d99\u5b50\u6602\n   A horse\n   Probably Kang-hsi copy.\n\n34 Chao-tzu-ang \u8d99\u5b50\u6602\n   Summer landscape\n   Kang-hsi copy.\n\n35 Tang-tzu-hua \u5510\u5b50\u83ef\n   Spring in the mountains\n   Typical of the style of the Y\u00fcan period. No longer the intimate feel-\n   ing of the Sung masters, but a tendency to decoration and sentiment. The\n   composition is still coherent. The lines across the picture were caused by\n   its having fallen into water.\n\n36 C'hi'en-hs\u00fcan \u9322\u9078\n   Maku, the fairy, with a phoenix in the clouds\n   Notice the rhythm of the lines in the drapery of Maku and the\n   refined brush-work with which the bird is executed.\n\n37 Ch'ien-hs\u00fcan \u9322\u9078\n   Two pheasants on a stream in the mountains\n   Probably a Ming copy.\n\n38 Ch'ien-hs\u00fcan \u9322\u9078\n   Lameh tree with blossoms, roses, daffodils and birds\n   Probably a Ming copy.\n\n39 Ch'ien-hs\u00fcan \u9322\u9078\n   Poppies, butterflies and insects\n   A Tao-kuang copy.\n40 Ma-yih \u99ac\u9038\n\nWild geese and peonies\n\nPoetical composition; the blossoms are of rare beauty and the geese, caught in typical positions, are full of life and truth to nature.\n\n41 Huang-kung-wang \u9ec3\u516c\u671b\n\nSpring in the mountains\n\nProbably Ts'ing copy. Characteristic of Yuan style.\n\n42 Pien-ching-chao \u908a\u666f\u662d\n\nPheasants and other birds in bamboo\n\nTs'ing copy.\n\n43 Pien-ching-chao \u908a\u666f\u662d\n\nTitmice in a blossoming larch tree\n\n44 Pien-ching-chao \u908a\u666f\u662d\n\nMagnolias and peonies\n\nVery impressive by its simplicity.\n\n45 Pien-ching-chao \u908a\u666f\u662d\n\nPheasants and mynah by a cascade\n\nProbably Ming copy.\n\n46 Pien-ching-chao \u908a\u666f\u662d\n\nA hundred quails\n\nMing copy. The original must have been still larger.\n\n47 Mi-chia-chao \u7c73\u4f73\u8a54\n\nRainy landscape\n\n48 Chang-hsun \u5f35\u905c\n\nSpring in the mountains\n\nProbably Kang-hsi copy.\n\n49 Sung-juh-chih \u5b8b\u6c5d\u5fd7\n\nAutumn landscape\n\nMing copy.\n\nMing Dynasty 1368-1644\n\n50 T'ang-yin \u5510\u5bc5\n\nRomantic mountain scenery\n\nThis is an eminent work in the style of T'ang-yin. The dominating conical mountain in the left, the rifted rocks and the countryhouses in the foreground, the perspective of the valley in the background with the flight of ducks in the air create together a unique effect. All the line drawing seems to live. Only a proud and superior artist would have dared delineate a mountain like that on the left. If it were possible to get a genuine T'ang-yin in China, one would be inclined to regard this genuine; but it is a Ming copy.\n51 T'ang-yin \u5510\u5bc5  \nThe Lu mountains in Kiangsu  \nMing copy. Quite a different side of T'ang-yin's art. Painted with black ink on paper.\n\n52 T'ang-yin \u5510\u5bc5  \nA pagoda and temple in the mountains  \nTs'ing copy after an early T'ang-yin.\n\n53 T'ang-yin \u5510\u5bc5  \nMarsh-mallow  \nModern copy.\n\n54 T'ang-yin \u5510\u5bc5  \nAutumn in the mountains  \nTs'ing copy. Characteristic of the style of T'ang-yin.\n\n55 T'ang-yin \u5510\u5bc5  \nA garden in summer  \nTs'ing copy. Very refined work. Another instance of T'ang-yin's versatility.\n\n56 T'ang-yin \u5510\u5bc5  \nA sage enjoying nature  \nModern copy. The bamboo is drawn well, but not the mountains.\n\n57 T'ang-yin \u5510\u5bc5  \nAutumn in the high mountains  \nKang-hsi copy. Grand composition in black and white on paper.\n\n58 T'ang-yin \u5510\u5bc5  \nA river in a mountainous country, autumn landscape  \nLate Ming or Kang-hsi copy.\n\n59 T'ang-yin \u5510\u5bc5  \nWang-hsi-chih returning home after a long absence  \nModern imitation.\n\n60 T'ang-yin \u5510\u5bc5  \nLotus flower  \nMing copy.\n\n61 W\u00ean-ch\u00eang-ming \u6587\u5fb5\u660e  \nA harbour with many junks  \nProbably an imitation.\n\n62 W\u00ean-ch\u00eang-ming \u6587\u5fb5\u660e  \nAn autumn landscape  \nMuch injured but still showing W\u00ean-ch\u00eang-ming's delicate brush.\n63 Tung-ch'i-ch'ang \u8463\u5176\u660c\n   Rainy landscape\n   Probably a copy. The misty atmosphere of a rainy day is wonderfully depicted.\n\n64 Tung-ch'i-ch'ang \u8463\u5176\u660c\n   Landscape\n   Probably a copy.\n\n65 L\u00fc-ki \u5442\u8a18\n   Nine herons\n   L\u00fc-ki was the most distinguished painter of birds during the Ming period.\n\n66 L\u00fc-ki \u5442\u8a18\n   Two pheasants above a rapid\n\n67 L\u00fc-ki \u5442\u8a18\n   Two herons under lotus leaves\n   Modern copy.\n\n68 L\u00fc-ki \u5442\u8a18\n   Ducks falling into water\n   Chien-lung copy.\n\n69 Ts'ai-tze \u8521\u6fa4\n   Winter landscape\n   Very vigorous brush-work, and in style more Sung than Ming. There are very few specimens in which a Ming painter has achieved this grandeur of style.\n\n70 Chang-ping-shan \u5f35\u5e73\u5c71\n   A sage in the rain\n   The atmosphere of a rainy day could not be better represented; the work is of a very refined artist.\n\n71 Chang-ch'un-chen-jen \u9577\u6625\u771f\u4eba\n   Magpies in a tree\n\n72 Chin-t'ao \u91d1\u6fe4\n   White peonies and a heron\n\n73 Ch\u00fc-shan \u5de8\u5c71\n   Lotus flowers\n\n74 Lu-pao-shan \u9678\u5305\u5c71\n   Phoenix, storks, ducks and other birds\n\n75 Lu-pao-shan \u9678\u5305\u5c71\n   Camellias and other flowers\n\n76 Lu-pao-shan \u9678\u5305\u5c71\n   Mandarin ducks, rose-mallows, bindweeds and bamboo\n   Chien-lung copy.\n77 Ch'en-chang \u9673\u748b  \nRose-mallows and butterflies\n\n78 Wang-hsien \u738b\u8b28  \nThe thunderstorm  \nFinger painting.
