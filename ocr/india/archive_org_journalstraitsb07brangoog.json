Cameron.\n\nI am indebted to Mr. John Hewitt, the Curator of the Sarawak Museum, for the opportunity of describing the following species of *Iphiaulax* which appears to be the most abundant genus of Hymenoptera in Malaya, so far as the number of species is concerned.\n\nThe species may be most conveniently grouped by the form of the plate on the base of the 2nd abdominal segment.\n\ni. The plate large, triangular, striated, bordered by oblique striae. *Insignis*, Sm., *cariniceps*, Cam., *octofoveatus*, Cam. In this group the 1st abdominal segment is closely longitudinally striated, and the metanotum is more or less black.\n\nii. The plate minute smooth, followed by a keel which extends to the apex of the segment; the central part bordered by keels; the 1st segment keeled laterally and down the centre. *Alienatus*, Cam.\n\niii. The plate moderately wide at the base, becoming gradually narrowed to a fine point, then continued as a keel to the apex of the segment. In this group the striation does not extend beyond the middle of the 3rd segment, the following segments being smooth. There is a distinct keel down the middle of the 1st abdominal segment and a less distinct one along the sides. *Extraneus*, Cam. *erythecus*, Cam., and *declinatus*, Cam.\n\nJour. Straits Branch R. A. Soc., No. 48, 1907.\niv. The plate striated, gradually narrowed to a point at or near the apex of the segment. The striation in this group extends to the apex of the 4th abdominal segment. The 1st abdominal segment is more or less striated and the metanotum is more or less black; in longiceps it is strongly striated. Longiceps, Cam.; lineativentris, Cam.; pallidiorbitalis, Cam., which is noteworthy for the head being largely pale yellow.\n\nIphiaulax insignis, Sm.\n\nBracon insignis, Smith, Journ. Linn. Soc., 1857, 123. Iphiaulax insignis, Szepligeti, Termes. F\u00fczetek, XXIV. 372. ?\n\nThis long-tailed species has been taken by Mr. Hewitt in September. The \u2640 is 22 mm. long; with the ovipositor 83 mm; its 1st abdominal segment is closely longitudinally striated; the area on 2nd segment is large triangular, ending in a sharp point, not reaching to the base of the apical third of the segment; it is bordered by stronger, oblique striae, the rest of the segment bears close, more or less interlacing striae; the 3rd to near the apex and the basal two-thirds of the 4th are closely striated, the striae radiating from the middle; the rest of the abdomen smooth, bare shining. The face is tinged with yellow; the head somewhat thickly covered with black pubescence. Basal half of mandibles red, tinged with yellow, the apical black. Palpi pale red, covered with pale pubescence.\n\nThe I. insignis of Szepligeti, quoted above from Java, is probably different from Smith's insect, from Borneo; Smith gives the length of the ovipositor as 44 lines; Szepligeti gives the length of his insignis as 55 mm.; the body length being 20 mm. Of the known Bornean species the present can only be confounded with I Shelfordi, Cam. (Journ. St. Br. Roy. As. Soc. 1903, 103), which is smaller (15 mm.), but with the ovipositor longer (95 mm.), the striation only extends on the abdomen to the middle of the 3rd segment; the area on the 2nd is longer, being twice longer than its greatest width;\n\nJour. Straits Branch,\nand the sheaths of the ovipositor are broadly white at the apex, the sheaths in *insignis* being entirely black. In *insignis* the 1st abdominal segment is more than twice longer that it is wide at the apex.\n\n*Iphiaulax cariniceps*, sp. nov.\n\nBlack, the head, thorax, except the centre of metanotum broadly, the anterior legs, the middle, except the tarsi, and the base of hind coxae, red; wings fuscous violaceous, the nervures and stigma in part testaceous; the middle of face depressed, with a stout keel down the middle, the 1st, 2nd, the 3rd, except at the apex and the basal half of the 4th abdominal segment strongly closely longitudinally striated; the area on 2nd segment triangular, slightly longer than it is wide at the base; closely longitudinally striated, reaching to the middle of the segment.\n\nLength 14 mm., Sterebra 42 mm.\n\nKuching. March.\n\nFace coarsely, rugosely not closely punctured, sparsely covered with black hair; the clypeus more closely and finely punctured. Front broadly depressed, the depression deep, clearly defined, twice the width of the lateral part, which is closely, distinctly punctured and sparsely covered with black hair; the centre is bare, aciculated, shining. Antennal scape, shining, bare, not much dilated at the apex, about 3 times longer than thick. Malar space furrowed, the depression much widened below. Thorax smooth, parapsidal furrows deep; the metanotum thickly covered with black hair. The 1st abdominal segment is fully one third longer than wide, the basal half with a rounded slope; the central part of the 2nd is bounded by a keel which converges towards the apex; the part bounding the area stoutly, obliquely striated, the part at its apex is more finely and closely longitudinally striated; outside the keel is a depression, closely, strongly obliquely striated, and with a large, almost smooth depression at its apex; the outer edge closely, rugosely longitudinally striated. Suturiform articulation wide, deep, crenulated, widened at the\n\nE. A. Soc, No. 48, 1907.\nouter edges; there is a narrower crenulated furrow at the base of the 3rd segment. The basal half of the wings has the fuscous colour suffused with fulvous, the nervures there being blackish; the nervures on the apical half are paler, fuscous in colour; the basal half of the stigma testaceous, the apex dark fuscous, legs somewhat densely pilose; the sheaths of the ovipositor more densely covered with stiffer black pubescence.\n\nThe wide triangular area on the 2nd abdominal segment is rare with the Bornean species of *Iphiaulax*. It is found with *I. igninis*, Sm.\n\n*Iphiaulax octofoveatus*, sp. nov.\n\nBlack; the head, thorax and 4 anterior legs red; the median segment largely tinged with black; the middle tarsi blackish, wings fuscous, the nervures and stigma black; the apical half of the 1st, the 2nd entirely and the basal half of the 3rd, 4th and 5th segments in the centre, coarsely irregularly rugosely striated, the stripe irregular, more or less broken, the stripe on the 2nd stronger and more distinctly separated; the area broad, triangular, as long as it is wide at the base; a keel as long as itself runs from its apex to near the middle. The head and mesonotum sparsely, the metanotum and back of abdomen more densely covered with black hair. Face rugosely punctured, the centre raised and smoother. First abdominal segment of almost equal width, 3 times longer than it is wide at the base, slightly, but distinctly longer than the 2nd; the segments are all longer than wide; the abdomen is 3 times longer than the thorax; slender; the suturiform articulation crenulated, not bifurcated at the apex; there are oval foveae on the sides of the 3rd to 6th segments. The hind coxae are longer than usual, almost as long as the 1st abdominal segment and of almost equal width. Temples roundly narrowed, as long as the top of the eyes; the occiput rounded inwardly.\n\nLength 12 mm.\n\nKuching. July.\n\nA distinct species.\n\nJour Straits Branch\nIphiaulax alienatus, sp. nov.\n\nBlack, the head, thorax and anterior legs red, the middle legs red, suffused with black, the 1st abdominal segment smooth, the middle with a stout keel, the sides with a weaker, more irregular keel, the 2nd segment and the basal two-thirds of the 3rd strongly irregularly striated, the 2nd with a central keel slightly, triangularly dilated at the base, extending to the apex of the segment, the central part bordered by keels which slightly converge towards the apex; the suturiform articulation wide, deep, crenulated; there is a wide, transverse depression shortly beyond the middle of the 3rd, where the striae end; there are 3 stouter keels down the centre almost dividing the depression into 2 parts.

Fore tibiae short, stout, broadly, distinctly narrowed at the base; the hind coxae are more than twice longer than thick; the fore tibiae have one, the posterior four have 2 moderately long spurs; the legs are slender and, except as regards the fore tibiae, are formed as in the Cryptinae. The 1st abdominal segment is roundly curved at the base; its sides are keeled above and below; the spiracles are placed before the middle.\n\nThe only group in which this genus can be placed is the Acoenitini; the form of the 1st abdominal segment and the position of its spiracles separate it from the Cryptinae, with which it has a considerable resemblance.

On the other hand it has not the ploughshare-shaped, prominent hypopygium of the Acoenitini. So far as the alar neuration is concerned it is as in the Cryptinae, as e.g. in Mesostenus.

Owing to the noise that was made by all his followers all the animals had run right away. A certain pelandok was also running away. While he was busy running along glancing to the right and to the left, he came to a certain place where there was a pond, into which he fell. He swam to the west and he swam to the east looking for a place to get up but he could not find one. While he was in this fix an elephant passed. Now at that time of day there happened to be a very big storm indeed with thunder booming and lightning crackling hither and thither. When the pelandok saw the elephant, he said to him, \"Ho Ka Sang Gajah, are you not afraid that the sky will fall in? Just listen to the noise, rum rum.\"\n\nThe elephant said, \"If the sky is really going to tumble in, I am afraid it may hit me, and if it hits me I shall die.\"\n\nThe elephant then said, \"What are you doing down there in that very deep well?\"\n\nThe pelandok replied, \"Oh I have two reasons for being in this well. First I ran away from this sky that is going to fall in, then secondly I saw very rare game in this well which has never been seen by my grand-fathers, great-grand-fathers, great-great-grand-fathers or great-great-great-grand-fathers, who were before me.\"\n\nThe elephant then said, \"If that is really so, may I also come in and get away from this sky that is on the point of falling in? May I too see this game?\"\n\nThe pelandok said, \"If you are frightened and if you want to see this game, come along.\"\n\n* This tale is by Penghulu Mohamed Noordin bin Jaffar of Kota Stia, Lower Perak. The source is unknown.\n\nB. A. Soc., No. 48, 1907.\nSo the elephant tumbled right down into the well. After that a tiger came along, on whom the same trick was played. And then a rhinoceros on whom the same trick was played. And then a deer on whom the same trick was played. And then a wild pig on whom the same trick was played. When they were all inside the well, the pelandok said, \"Hei, I fooled you that time.\"\n\nWhen the tiger heard what the pelandok said he (the tiger) said, \"Very good, Salam di Rimba, if ever I get out of this well, I will eat you.\"\n\nWhile he was saying this the pelandok took a piece of wood and began to tease the elephant. The elephant said, \"Stop that, or I shall kick you.\" But the pelandok paid no attention and went on teasing. At last the elephant kicked him right up on to the ground outside, saying, \"Now you are sure to be killed when struck by the sky.\"\n\nThe pelandok said, \"Oh that was merely my cunning. I wanted to get out and could not, so I said the sky would fall in.\"\n\nJust then the tiger scrambled up to the edge and got away into the jungle, saying as he went \"If ever I catch you, I'll eat you.\"\n\nAfter that the pelandok went to some people and said, \"Hoo ee . . . gentles and lords, in that well there, there are many beasts. Elephants, rhinoceroses, pigs and deer have fallen into it. You can go and take them.\"\n\nAfter that he went on his way. The tiger also went on his, looking for the pelandok, but the pelandok kept on moving. After two or three days the pelandok came across a very large hornets' nest. Indeed the noise of the hornets could be heard about twenty yards away. He walked on very slowly carrying a leaf with him, and then he sat down near the hornets' nest which he gentle fanned. A short time after he was so seated the tiger came along and said to him, \"This time I really will eat you, Salam di Rimba.\"\n\nJour. Straits Branch,\nA PEANDOK TALE.\n\nThe pelandok said, \"Don't talk of eating me when I have had orders from King Solomon to take care of his gong.\"\n\nThe tiger said, \"Is that really King Solomon's gong that you are looking after?\"\n\nThe pelandok answered, \"Are you deaf? Listen carefully. Does not it sound by itself? When it is struck its sound is wonderfully sweet. So delicious is it that perhaps if you were to hear it you could neither eat nor sleep.\"\n\nThe tiger said, \"Hei Salam di Rimba, may I try and strike it? I am very anxious to listen to the sound.\"\n\nThe pelandok answered, \"Ka Sang Rimau, you are speaking like a madman. You are speaking as if it were my own. Still I don't know. If you very much want to hear it I will go and tell King Solomon. If he allows it, you may strike. But mind you strike it when I say you may, and not before.\"\n\nThe tiger replied, \"Very well.\" So the pelandok rushed away. When he got some way off he said, \"Ho Ka Sang Rimau, King Solomon commands you to strike.\" When the tiger heard that he struck it with his paw. The hornets stung him all over his body. The tiger ran here and there in very great pain. He threw his whole soul into his running.\n\nThe tiger said, \"Very good. I have not got hold of you yet; but if ever I do meet you, there is not the slightest doubt that I will eat you.\"\n\nAfter that the pelandok walked on very hungry and looking for some food. Two or three days later he came across a very large and extremely handsomely striped python. Its coils were just like a very handsomely striped cloth. The pelandok sat down by it. The tiger walked on in a rage looking for the pelandok. At last he met him and said to him, \"This time your doom has overtaken you, Salam di Rimba.\"\n\nThe pelandok said, \"Don't keep on talking of dooms. Look first. What is this? Do you know its name?\"\nThe tiger went close to look at the python and said, \"Hei Salam di Rimba, what is this called?\"\n\nThe pelandok replied, \"This is what I have been ordered by my lord King Solomon to take care of. It is called King Solomon's waist-cloth. This handsome cloth descended to him from his ancestors. Its great charm lies in the fact that it prevents one from dying. If it is worn for an hour, you are not likely to die for at least a year after that.\"\n\nThe tiger thought, perhaps what he says is true, so he said \"Hei Salam di Rimba let me put it on for an hour, for I am not very well able to search after my food.\"\n\nThen Salam di Rimba replied, \"Hei Ka Sang Rimau, just reflect a moment. Is it right? I nor my ancestors have never seen a cloth like this, let alone possessed one. This is King Solomon's own and I have been ordered by him to take care of it. Still if you are really want to try it, wait a bit till I first go and lay your request before King Solomon.\"\n\nThe tiger said, \"Make haste Salam di Rimba, for I am very hungry.\"\n\nSo the pelandok rushed off swiftly. A little later he called out from a distance. \"Ho Ka Sang Rimau, put it on, put it on.\"\n\nSo the tiger took the python's head and put it round his waist. The snake gave him a terrific squeeze and the tiger jumped here and there like a stuck fowl, half dead, struggling to escape from the snake's coils. At last he managed to get free. He was till more incensed against the pelandok. He went on his way looking out for some food, and peering here and there for the pelandok. The pelandok also went away from that place. At last about five or six days after, he met the tiger. The tiger said, \"This very day your doom has newly overtaken you Salam di Rimba.\"\n\nThe pelandok answered, \"What is to be done? Still I would like to ask you one thing.\"\n\nThe tiger said, \"What do you want to ask?\"\n\nJour, Straits Branch,\nThe pelandok said, \"If you want to eat me please swallow me whole without crunching me. If you crunch me up I will live, but if you swallow me, I will die. Then too you must swallow me head foremost. If you swallow me tail first I will live, but if head first I will die.\"\n\nThe tiger said, \"Very well.\" Thereafter he swallowed the pelandok whole, head first. After he had been swallowed, the pelandok worked its way through the tiger's stomach and proceeded to stick his head out of the tiger's fundament. The tiger rejoiced greatly at having disposed of the pelandok and went on seeking for his food. He came across a pig. He crouched down to wait for it. The pelandok knew that the tiger was lurking for that pig so he called out, \"Ho, pig, pig, pig, run away. This tiger is going to spring on you.\"\n\nWhen the pig heard that he ran away. The tiger said, \"Curse this fundament of mine. It is making a noise every day. It never used to do that.\"\n\nSo he searched for a tree stump and rubbed himself against it till his back was all bloody. In fact after the tiger swallowed the pelandok he never got a thing to eat and so he became very hungry. When he had been several days without food, and was ravenously hungry, the tiger went after a man who was making a clearing in the jungle, and lay in wait to catch him. The pelandok knew that the tiger wanted to catch the man who was busy in the clearing so he called out, \"Ho you there in the clearing, run away, the tiger wants to catch you.\"\n\nWhen the man heard a voice like that he ran off. The tiger was very astonished that his hindquarters should speak like that. He was very angry indeed with his back. So he scratched himself against every tree until he was covered with blood. Finally his back became flyblown and covered with a great many large maggots. Also he became unable to walk owing to the length of time that he had been unable to get anything to eat. At last he died. The pelandok also was very hungry, for for a long time he too had had no food. He was tremendously thirsty. So he got out and went hither and\nthither but could get nothing to eat or drink. At last he got to a river where he had a drink. He noticed on the other bank fruit which he could eat. Then he looked carefully for a minute and thought, \"How am I to get across? I don't think I am able, for I am very weak.\"\n\nThen he had an inspiration, \"I had better call sisters Sang Garagi, and say that they have all been ordered by King Solomon to come to the top of the water and that I have been ordered to take a census of all that are in the river.\"\n\nAfter that all the crocodiles that were in that river came to the top of the water. The pelandok said, \"Elder sisters Sang Garagi, arrange yourselves properly please, head to head so that I can count you easily.\"\n\nThe crocodiles then arranged themselves from one side of the river right across to the other bank. After that the pelandok jumped on to the heads of the crocodiles counting, \"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten,\" and so on till he got across. When he reached it he jumped up on to the dry ground and said, \"Hei, that was my cunning. I wanted to get across and could not, so I told you of King Solomon's order.\"\n\nThen he had his meal. The crocodile said, \"You had better not come here to drink, we will catch you and then only will be satisfied.\"\n\nSome days after, what with his walking and his looking for his food, the pelandok became very thirsty and went to the river bank to drink. A crocodile came and caught him by the foot. The pelandok said, \"Do you think that you have caught my foot? Is it not a twig that you have caught?\"\n\nThe crocodile thought, \"Perhaps that is so, for I do not feel any flesh and it tastes just like a piece of wood.\"\n\nSo the crocodile let go and the pelandok sprang up the bank and said, \"Hei, that was only my cunning. You really had my foot, but I said that it was a branch.\"\n\nJour. Straits Branch,\nA PELANDOK TALE.\n\nAfter that the pelandok went on to the seaside to a place where some men lived who had fishing stakes. When he got near he heard the men in the fishing village making a commotion because the whole of their fish disappeared, being eaten up every day by some animal. The pelandok thought what can this be that eats all the men's fish. So one day when all the men had gone to sea he crept below a house in the village. He had lain there only a minute when a giant came along, and quite devoured all of the fish in the village. The pelandok thought, \"It seems that it is this evil giant that is devouring all these men's fish.\"\n\nThen he said, \"Good, to-morrow I will give him some medicine.\"\n\nAfter that all the men came back from the sea to the village and saw that their fish were again finished. They said, \"Who is it that devours our fish? If we only knew we would kill him.\"\n\nAfter that the next day the men once more went away to sea, and the pelandok came into the village and looked round for a piece of rotan with which to make a running noose. While he was busy fixing the loop the giant came along to eat the fish and found the pelandok busy making the knot. The giant said, \"Hei Salam di Rimba, what are you doing there?\"\n\nThe pelandok replied, \"Two things only, first to increase the deadliness of my eye teeth and second to make a medicine for all stiffnesses of joints or bones.\"\n\nA little later the pelandok said, \"Granpa, I want to sleep a little. Don't disturb me.\"\u2014\"Very well.\"\u2014\"When my eyes wink that is a sign that I am asleep.\"\u2014When my eyes are closed that is a sign that I am asleep.\"\n\nThe pelandok then threw himself down and closed his eyes. The giant thought perhaps in a little he will wink. The giant saw the pelandok's eyes wink, so he thought that he really was asleep. The giant then touched the pelandok's eye teeth saying, \"Is this, this very deadly thing? It ought not to be so judging from its size.\"\nAfter this the pelandok got up from his sleep and the giant said, \"Hei Salam di Rimba, I want to sleep now.\"\n\nThe giant really went to sleep, so the pelandok took some hot ashes and put them on the giant's paw, while he himself sat down a little way off. After that the giant began to hop about owing to his burnt hand. The pelandok pretended to be alarmed and said, \"What has happened granpa to make you jump like that? What is the matter?\" \"My hand got so tremendously hot that I started from my sleep.\" \"Perhaps granpa, you interfered with my eye teeth when I was asleep just now.\" \"That is true, I did just touch them.\" \"That is the deadly poison of my eye teeth, I told you not to touch them. And now your body suffers, granpa.\"\n\nThe giant became rather frightened because of Salam di Rimba and his many pieces of magic. The pelandok then began to make a knot. The giant said, \"What are you doing Salam di Rimba?\" \"I want to make some medicine for all the illnesses of the joints and bones and all tiredness and all pains in any part of the body.\"\n\nThe giant thought, that is true because he knows a great deal of magic. So he said, \"Salam di Rimba, I am in pain, can you give me this medicine?\" \"If granpa asks help, his grandchild will be glad to give assistance.\" \"Apply it.\"\n\nSo the pelandok took a loop and passed it round both his knees and his elbows and struck the knot till it was quite tight. Then he said, \"How are you, granpa? Try and move a little. Can you or not?\" \"I can't move the least little bit.\" \"Wait a little longer and all your illnesses will quite disappear, \"I am going to look for the leaf of the perambas in the forest and also some water from a knot of a tree.\" \"Be quick. If you are late the owners of the house will all return.\"\n\nThe pelandok went off into the jungle and never came back. A little later the men came back from the sea and found the giant trussed up in the house with all his joints securely tied. They said, \"This is what has been eating our fish all this time.\" So they beat and stabbed the giant till he died.\n\nJour. Straits Branch,\nA PELANDOK TALE.\n\nThe pelandok went on looking for his food up stream and down stream. At last he met a man who was busy hollowing out a sampan. The pelandok said, \"Perhaps you may make a boat: perhaps you may not.\" The man paid close attention to what the pelandok was saying and understood that the pelandok was making fun of him. So he took a shaving and threw it at the pelandok and hit him on the rump, where it broke. After that the pelandok went back to find his wife. When he reached her he said, \"Hooee, hooee, this time probably we shall be divorced.\" His wife replied, \"Why do you say that?\" Her husband said, \"I have been hit by that man, who is making a boat with a shaving. This is it on my rump.\"\n\nAfter that in about ten days he died and left his wife who was with child. And that is why to this day every pelandok has a white chip on his rump.\n\nA Pelandok Tale.\n\nAlk\u00e9sah maka adalah pada zaman dahulu kala kepada satu hari raja didalam satu n\u00e9gr\u00e9i itu, p\u00e9rgilah ia b\u00e9rburu maka b\u00e9-b\u00e9rapa hari sa'ekor pun tiada dapat.

Pertamanya aku lari diperpada langit hendak runtuh itu. Kedua-dua aku melihat pemanan yang sangat indah didalam telaga ini, yang belum pernah di-lihat oleh datoh nenek moyang munyit aku dahulu dahulu.\" Maka kata gajah, \"Jika betul bagitu bolehlah aku, Salam di Rimba, menumpang lari diperpada langit hendak runtuh serta menengok pemanan itu?\" Maka jawab pelandok, \"Jika takut, dan hendak menengok pemanan marilah bersama-sama kita.\" Kemudian gajah ini pun terjuulah kadalaman telaga itu.\n\nKemudian lalu pula harimau demikian juga.

Kemudian di-sepakkannya gajah pelandok itu lepas-lah ia ka-darat serta kata gajah itu, \"Mampuslah kamu di-timpas langit.\" Maka kata pelandok, \"Hei akal aku sahaja, ilendak naik aku tiada lalu, aku katakan langit hendak runtuh.\" Maka didalam hal yang demikian itu, ini harimau ia panjat tepi telaga itu, lepas-lah juga ia ka-darat maka kata harimau itu, \"Baiklah masihkan aku tiada berjumpa dengan kamu aku hendak makan juga.\" Kemudian ini pelandok pun pergilah ia pada orang serta ia khabar, katanya, \"Huee inche, inche, tuan, tuan itu, didalam telaga itu, banyak-banyak binatang sudah jatoh, gajah, badak, babi, rusa ada disitu, boleh pengi ambil.\" Habis itu ia\nlalu berjalan.

Tamat.\nThe Pelandok, His Adopted Son and Pa' Si Bago'.\n\nThe story is told that once on a time in the olden days a certain man was busy digging a well when a pelandok passed by. The pelandok said, \"What is the use of this man making a well! He is only tiring himself.\" The man then got out to throw things at the pelandok, but he missed. The pelandok ran off. After the well was done the man went away home to his house. The pelandok too came strolling back to the edge of the well, when quite unexpectedly he happened to tumble right down into it. He tried to get out and could not. While in this fix a wild pig passed by. The pelandok called out,\n\n\"Ho Ka Sang Babi, where are you going to?\"\n\nThe pig said, \"Salam di Rimba, what are you doing there?\"\n\n\"I am sitting here playing and amusing myself, for as long I can ever remember I can never recollect a pleasure like this.\"\n\n\"May I too come in?\"\n\n\"If you want to come in you may. But are you willing to promise?\"\n\n\"Promise what?\"\n\n\"Don't be long: you must only be a very short time.\"\n\n\"Very well,\"\n\n\"Jump down.\"\n\nAnd the pig then sprang right down into the well.\n\nAfterwards a rhinoceros passed by on whom the same trick was played. Then a barking deer, then a sambhur deer.\n\n* This story is told by l'enghulu that Noordin of Kota Stia, who learnt it from the Lekah binti Jaman, who was of genuine Perak descent.\n\nJgr. Straits Branch, R. A. Soc., No. 48, 1907.\nLast of all a bull elephant passed by, to whom Salam di Rimba said,\n\n\"Ho elephant! elephant!! are you not afraid the sky is going to topple over?\"\n\nFor at this time it looked very like a great rain storm with thunder and thunderbolts. The elephant answered, \"Is that true?\"\n\nSalam di Rimba said, \"Of course it is true. Just look: all of us have run and huddled together here. Why? We fear that the sky will fall in.\"\n\nThe elephant said, \"If that is so, I had better come down too.\"\n\nThe pelandok said, \"Come down quickly.\" So the elephant came down and entered into the well. As soon as he was right in the pelandok took a piece of wood and began to tease the elephant. The elephant said, \"Stop that. Look out, or I will kick you up outside where you will certainly perish struck by the fall of the sky.\" But the pelandok paid no attention and went on teasing, so the elephant became very angry indeed and at last he kicked the pelandok, hurling him right up outside. Salam di Rimba was very glad when he found himself outside, and said,\n\n\"Hei, I fooled you nicely that time. I fell into that well, and could not climb out, so I said that the sky would fall in.\"\n\nJust then the noise of a drum being beaten in a neighbouring village was heard, so Salam di Rimba went to the drum beater. On arriving he found that he was making preparations for the marriage of his daughter. Salam di Rimba said, \"Ho gentlemen and lords, if you happen to want to eat barking deer or sambhur deer, just go and get them in that well over there.\" The people simply fell over one another in their rush to see that well. When they got there they saw that what Salam di Rimba said was quite true. So they killed the elephant and the other animals, while they cut the throats of the sambhur deer and the barking deer. And they made a feast of the deer. When all the\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nmen and all the women were in the middle of the feast Salam di Rimba went up into the house and began to upset the ceremonial rice and eggs and to eat them. At once an uproar arose in the house and some said, \"The pelandok has come to attack us, we had better catch and kill him.\" When they chased him he took up a small pillow and got on to the ridge pole of the house. When they beat up stream he seemed to be down stream; when they beat down stream he seemed to be up stream. While this was going on he let the pillow fall to the ground. They all thought that this was the pelandok so they all stabbed at it, while he slipped down on the other side and got away. So they all went up into the house again.\n\nAfter that Salam di Rimba took a large piece of clotted rice from a big pot and taking it to the river embarked in it and paddled away. After some time he reached another village where he met a boy. Salam di Rimba said, \"What are you doing here?\" The boy replied, \"Nothing in particular.\" Salam di Rimba said, \"If that is so, come and let us sail away together.\" The boy said, \"Very well.\" So both of them got into the boat and sailed away.\n\nAt last they came to a certain reach where they stopped for a time. And there they met a Pa' Si Bago', * that is a big solitary monkey (brok). Salam di Rimba said to him, \"Pa, Si Bago', what are you doing here?\" Pa' Si Bago' replied, \"I am doing nothing just now.\" Salam di Rimba said, \"If you are doing nothing, come along with us.\" Pa' Si Bago' replied, \"All right, let the three of us sail away together.\"\n\nNow after some time they arrived at a certain country which had been laid waste by a tiger. Few and sparse were the people of the land. One morning Salam di Rimba met a man, an inhabitant of the land, who was dawdling along. Salam di Rimba said to him,\n\n* Pak si Bajok, ia itu berok tunggal. There is only one other story known to Mat Noordin about Pak si Bajok (see p. 68 of Journal No. 47) Nor is there any farther adventure of Pak si Bajok that he can relate in this tale.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 48, 1907.\n\"Ho sir, why is this country so silent?\"\n\nThe man replied, \"It has been laid waste by a tiger.\"\n\nSalam di Rimba said, \"You can tell your king that it is not very hard to kill that tiger.\"\n\nSo the man went and told the king what Salam di Rimba had said. Then he went to call Salam di Rimba, for the king had said, \"Go and call this Salam di Rimba.\" So he went to call him. When he found him he told him of the King's command. Salam di Rimba replied, \"Very well.\" So they went away together. When they arrived, the king said, \"Is it true that you have said to this man that you can kill the tiger?\"\n\nSalam di Rimba replied, \"With the aid of your Majesty's effluence, God willing, your slave will slay the tiger. But prithee bestow on your slave a vessel full of bird lime and two bags of cotton.\"\n\nThe king ordered the bird lime and the cotton to be produced. When they had both been brought they were given to Salam di Rimba, who said,\n\n\"Pardon my lord, a thousand thousand pardons, peradventure the tiger will die, what will be the reward of your slave?\"\n\nThe king said, \"If the tiger dies, I will give you my daughter in marriage.\" Salam di Rimba replied, \"Very well.\"\n\nHe enquired from what direction and at what time the tiger came. He was told that it was at evening. People bearing the jar of bird lime and the cotton went along with him to show him the place. When he arrived there he sat down and ordered the people who had brought the bird lime and the cotton to return to their homes. A short time after the tiger came along and met him. Salam di Rimba said, \"Ka Sang Rimau, where are you going?\"\n\n\"I am going to attack this country.\"\n\n\"How long have you been waging war upon this land?\"\n\n\"About three months.\"\n\nJour. Straits Branch,\n\"Why have you been so long without running riot through the country and subduing it? Perhaps you have no magic. For if perchance you had the proper magic you must inevitably subdue this country.\"\n\n\"Teach me this magic, so that I may be enabled to subdue this country.\"\n\n\"Perhaps if I teach you, you will not believe me.\"\n\n\"If you teach me I will certainly believe you.\" While they were talking thus the tiger observed the jar of bird lime and the cotton, and said, \"What is this, Salam di Rimba?\"\n\nSalam di Rimba answered, \"This is it, this is the great magic. If you apply this to your body, your body must inevitably increase in strength and your courage will also become greater.\"\n\nThe tiger said, \"Please apply it to my body.\"\n\nSo Salam di Rimba spread the bird lime all over his body and face and eyes. Afterwards he did the same with the cotton. Then when this work was all finished and the tiger had been blinded he called the people all together and ordered them to set fire to all the lalang grass in that place. So the people fired the grass. The tiger hurled himself upstream and downstream, but the fire caught him and devoured him and he forthwith died. After that the people went to tell the king. And the king rejoiced greatly at the news that the tiger had died. Salam di Rimba went before the king and made obeisance saying,\n\n\"Pardon my lord, the tiger has been safely destroyed, and now your slave would claim the fulfilment of your former promise.\" The king said,\n\n\"When I am ready I will fulfil my promise.\"\n\nSo the king made great preparations for the marriage of his daughter with the pelandok. Salam di Rimba said,\n\n\"Please do not marry her to your slave, for your slave is only an animal. Let my lord marry her to my adopted son.\"\n\nE. A. Soc., No. 48, 1907\nThe king was glad for a man had been substituted for an animal. Seven days and seven nights were spent in preparations and then the king's daughter was married to Salam di Rimba's adopted son.\n\nAfter many days the king's son-in-law urged Salam di Rimba to return because he wanted to see his mother once more.

So he made preparations for forty days and forty nights. The days were like the nights and the nights like the days. While this was going on the news was bruited abroad in other countries.\n\nThere was a certain robber who wished to go and rob the King's house. So he set off by himself. On the way he met with another man, who said to him, \"Where are you going to?\"\n\nThe robber, who is Number One, replied, \"I am off to rob the house of the king, who is busy making all these preparations.\"\n\nNumber Two said, \"Can I go with you?\"\n\n\"What can you do?\"\n\n\"If you get anything that you want to steal, I can carry it for you.\"\n\nNumber One said very good. So they set off together. A little while after they met another man who also spoke to them.\n\nThis man said, \"Where are you off to?\"\n\nNumber One replied, \"We are off to rob the house of this king who is making all these preparations.\"\n\nThen said Number Three, \"Can I come with you?\"\n\n\"What can you do?\"\n\n* A story by Penghulu Mohamed Noordin bin Joffar of Kota Sia Lower Perak. Source unknown.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 48, 1907.\n\"No matter how deep a thing may be in the sea I can dive for it.\"\n\nSo all three went on together. It was not very long before they met another man who also spoke to them. \"Where are you three going?\"\n\nNumber One answered, \"We three are going to rob the house of the king who is making all these preparations?\"\n\nNumber Four said, \"Can I come with you?\"\n\n\"What can you do?\"\n\n\"What I can do is this: no matter how high a thing may be, I can hit it with my bow and arrow.\"\n\nAfter this the four of them went on together. A little while after they met another man who said to them, \"Where are you four men going to?\"\n\nNumber One answered, \"We want to rob the king's house who is making all these preparations.\"\n\nNumber Five said, \"Can I come with you?\"\n\n\"What can you do?\"\n\n\"Even if a person has been dead for one or two days, I can resuscitate him.\"\n\nNumber One said very good. So the five of them went on together. At last they reached the king's house about midnight. Then Number One applied his magic and the eyes of all the people in the king's fort fell fast asleep. So Number One went into the king's house lifted all the goldware and the silver and also took the king's daughter who was to be married. Then he gave them to Number Two, who carried all the stuff and also the king's daughter. The five went off into jungles and out of jungles, up mountains and down mountains, on to plains and across plains, and at last when it was day they halted. The king's daughter was still asleep. They then boiled enough rice for a meal. When it was ready they aroused the king's daughter. She started from her sleep and glanced to the right and to the left, in front and behind. Then she became very frightened and began to cry, she could eat no\nfood. But they all ate and were all very tired and very sleepy. At last they all fell asleep except the king's daughter who could not.\n\nThe story goes on to say that the king of the country who had lost his daughter and his property was very sorrowful. So too were his nobles. The nobles spread the news in all the countries round about. While this was going on the son of the Chief Vizier of one country who knew that the king's daughter had been lost, made a gigantic roe on which he flew off to a very great height. In a short while he noticed at the edge of a plain some small heaps. He went in that direction and when he got near he saw that this was the king's lost daughter. So he snatched her up and flew away. Number One started from his sleep and looked right and left behind and before, but he could see nothing of the king's daughter. Then he looked above and noticed a very large bird flying away. Then he woke up Number Four and said,\n\n\"The king's daughter has disappeared. Perhaps she has been pounced upon and carried off by that bird flying there. Now is the time for you to use your bow.\"\n\nSo Number Four took his bow and shot and hit the bird which fell into the sea.\n\nThen Number One said, \"This is the time for you to work.\"\n\nNumber three said, \"Very well.\" So he walked on till he walked into the sea then he dived right down into it. After a long time he found the king's daughter and brought her back to the place where his friends were waiting. But when he laid her down she was dead.\n\nThen Number One said to Number Five, \"This is the time for you to resuscitate the king's daughter and make her as she was before.\"\n\nSo Number Five stroked her face. In a little while the king's daughter sneezed and revived. Then they gave her a seat. But she began to cry once more. While this was going on Number One began to plan a division of the plunder.\n\nB. A. Soc., No. 48, 1907.\nNumber One said, \"Never mind about giving me a share of the booty. Give me the king's daughter and that will be plenty.\" But Number Two said the same, and Number Three said the same, and Number Four said the same, and Number Five said the same.\n\nThen Number One said, \"If that is so, we had better find a just king.\"\n\nAll of them were delighted by this plan and so the six of them travelled on together. But all the booty and the king's daughter were carried by Number Two. At last they reached a certain country where the king was very wise. There they lodged in a small house. Then the five of them went before the king to state their difficulty and to prefer their request. And Number One said, \"Pardon your majesty, a thousand thousand be the pardons accorded to your five slaves prostrate here. Now your five slaves went to rob a king's house and they took away all the goldware and all the silver and also his child at the same time. Now when your servant wished to divide up the property, your servant said, 'Never mind me, let me have the king's daughter only.' Then Number Two, who is the bearer, said the same thing, and Number Three, who is the diver, said the same thing, and Number Four, who is the bow man, said the same thing, and Number Five, who is the life giver, said the same thing. So we could not settle the matter. Thus it is that your five slaves have come before your most illustrious majesty, peradventure your majesty will give us a just decision.\"\n\nThe king said, \"This is a very easy matter to decide.\"\n\nWhen the king said that the five men made obeisance and became silent to hear the king's judgment.*\n\nThe king said, \"The man who first wanted to commit the robbery cannot get the, king's daughter, for he is as it were her father, for the child first of all comes from her father.\n\n*At this point the narrator insists they all his hearers shall give their opinion as to who ought to marry the princess. He then gives the king's verdict, after which he tells them how their choice has revealed their own character.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nNumber Two, that is the bearer of the king's daughter, he is just like her nurse, he cannot get her. And as to Number Three, he is the one to get her in marriage, because he has known her both in public and in private. Now Number Four, that is the bow man, he has been very loyal indeed to her, he cannot have her, for he has been just like a brother to her. As to Number Five, he cannot have her, for he has been just like a mother to her; for every child that has no mother to suckle it, how can it be and live?\"\n\nThus did the king gave judgment by a parable. And so as regards those who thought that Number One should get the princess we can all learn that those people who so think will want in all their work to be at the head of it, and as to those who thought that Number Two should get her, we learn that they like doing other people's work. And if any one thought that Number Three should get her, we know that whatever they may wish, they will seldom fail of it, and that their words will always fall true. And as to those who thought that Number Four should get her we learn that they are very loyal to their friends. And if anyone thought that Number Five should get her, then that man is a great lover of mankind.

Dan semua semuua itu makanlah ia dan semua semuua orang itu ka-l\u00e9tehan dan sangat hendak tidur. Maka semua semuanya tidur, maka itu tinggal anak raja yang tiada mau.\n\nKemudian tersbut k\u00e9sah raja didalam n\u00e9geri kahilangan anak dan harta-harta. Maka duka-chitlah raja dan orang besar-besar, maka memberi khabar segala orang besar-besar kepada segala n\u00e9geri yang dekat-dekat. Maka didalam antara itu, adalah sa'orang anak m\u00e9niri yang besar didalam n\u00e9geri, ia katahui anak raja sudah hilang. Maka ia menjadikan sa'ekor burong geruda dan terbanglah ia dengan beberapa tinginya. Maka tiada beberapa lama-nya terlihatlah kapadanya di-tepi padang b\u00e9rlonggok-longgok, maka ia tujuhah kapada tempat itu serta dekat di-nilatoyai tetul anak raja, didalam n\u00e9gerinnya, yang sudah hilang itu. Maka disambarnya lalu di-bawanya terbang. Kemudian terjutlah number satu di-tengoknya ka-kanan dan ka-kiri, ka-hadapan dan ka-b\u00e9lakang, tiada lagi anak raja itu. Maka terpandanglah ia ka atas, maka tampaklah sa'ekor burong terbang t\u00e9rialu b\u00e9sarnya. Kemudian di-jagakannya orang yang number ampat, kata number satu, \"Anak raja sudah hilang. Itulah barangkali di-sambar burong yang terbang itu. Maka inilah masa mika b\u00e9rk\u00e9rja boleh panah.\" Kemudian number ampat ambil panah, lalu di-panahnya. Maka kenalai burong lalu jatoh kadalaman laut. Kemudian kata number satu \"Jadiah masanya mika b\u00e9rk\u00e9rja.\" Maka kata number tiga,\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 48, 1907.\n\"Baiklah.\" Maka ia pun bercerita lalu masok laut menyelam didalam laut itu. Kemudian beberapa lamanya terjumpalah anak raja itu lalu dibawanya balik ke tempat kawannya tinggal itu. Maka serta sampai di letakannya anak raja itu sudah mati. Kemudian kata number satu, \"Inilah masanya nika berkata boleh mika hidupkan sa-mula ini anak raja.\" Maka number lima pun menyapu muka anak raja itu, maka tiada beberapa lamanya bersinlah ini anak raja. Maka anak raja itu pun menangis pula.\n\nMaka didalam antara itu, ini number satu masyarakat hendak membagi segala harta-harta itu. Maka kata number satu, \"Teman ini usah'lah dibagi harta-harta itu. Boleh teman dapat anak raja ini chukoplah.\" Kemudian kata number dua, demikian juga, dan kata number tiga demikian juga, dan kata number empat demikian juga, dan kata number lima demikian juga. Kemudian kata number satu, \"Jikalau bagitu, baiklah kita pergi chari raja yang adil.\" Habis itu semua-semua kawannya suka belaka. Jadi jalanan mereka itu anam orang, dan segala harta dan anak raja semua-semuanya dibawanya oleh number dua.\n\nKemudian didalam beberapa hari, tiba-tiba pada satu negeri masoklah ia didalam negeri itu, maka raja didalam negeri sangatlah bijaksana. Maka dudoklah ia menumpang pada satu rumah kecil. Kemudian pergilah lima-lima orang mengadap raja, mengadukan hal bichara dan maksudnya. Serta sampai mengadap raja, maka kata number satu, \"Ampun tuanku bering-ribu ampun sembah patek kalima orang ini. Maka adalah patek lima orang ini pergi mencari ka-rumah raja mengambil segala harta mas-mas dan perak serta dengan anak-nya sakali. Maka patek hendak bhagi harta itu. Maka kata patek pada kawan-kawan patek, \"Teman usah'lah namanya dapat harta, teman dapat anak raja ini pun sahaja.\" Kemudian kata number dua, iaitu si pembawa, demikian itu juga, dan kata number tiga, iaitu si penyelam demikian juga, dan kata number empat, si pemaham, demikian itu juga, dan kata number lima, iaitu si pemidop, demikian juga. Maka tiadalah dapat katentuan. Maka inilah, patek kalima, datang mengadap kabawah kaus duli yang maha mulia, mudah-mudahan yang maha mulia boleh mohukumkan dengan ka-adilannya.\"\n\nJnr. Straits Branch,\nKemudian titah raja itu, \"Fasal banyak senang hukuman-nya.\" Maka titah mohukumlah raja itu, make orang yang lima ini tundok berdiam dirinya, masing-masing mendengarkan hukum raja ini. Maka titah raja.\n\n\"Orang yang mula-mula hendak mencuri itu tiada boleh dapat anak raja itu. Adalah sa-umpamanya tiap-tiap anak itu aslinya diperda bapa datangnya. Dan number dua, iaitu orang yang membawa anak raja, itu umpamanya seperti pengasuh anak raja, tiada boleh dapat padanya. Dan number tiga, iaitu orang yang menyialam, iaitu boleh dapat berkawin dengan anak raja itu kerana ia sudah mengatahui tahir dan batinnya. Dan number ampat, iaitu pamanah, maka itu orang sangat setia akan anak raja itu. Maka ini orang tiada boleh dapat kapadanya. Adalah umpamanya seperti saudara anak raja itu. Dan number lima itu, iaitu yang mengidop, maka adalah ini orang tiada boleh dapat kapadanya. Adalah umpamanya seperti mak anak raja itu. Tiap-tiap budak tiada maknya seperti membori susu, tiada boleh budak ada dan hidop.\"\n\nDemikianlah di-ibaratkan oleh raja hukuman ini, maka hendaklah kita ambil katahui tiap-tiap orang yang ampunya fikiran mendapat pada number satu, maka itu orang hatinya apa-apa pekerjaan, dia hendak menjadi kepala juga. Dan jika mendapat pada number dua, maka itu orang suka mengajarakan pekerjaan orang-orang. Dan jika siapa-siapa mendapat pada number tiga maka itu orang apa-apa fikiran dia, yang hendak di-pertubuhnya jaranglah tiada jadi, selalu betul perkataannya. Dan maka siapa-siapa mendapat pada number ampat maka itu orang sangat setia dengan kawannya. Dan jika siapa-siapa mendapat pada number lima, maka ini orang sangat pengasih dan denyabong akan manusia. Hal inilah ibarat cerita ini adanya.\nMat Janin.*\n\nThe tale is told that once upon a time there was a man called S\u00e9mordan, who lived in a coconut plantation that he had made, and, thanks to God, he lived at his ease, he and his children eating of the foison of his plantation.\n\nNow one day he was walking with his children in the garden and he saw that many of the nuts were ripe. Just at that time S\u00e9mordan met a man who was a past master in the art of climbing coconuts and whose name was Mat Janin. S\u00e9mordan said to him, \"Hai Mat Janin, do you want to earn wages by climbing coconuts?\"\n\nMat Janin said, \"If the pay is right I would like it. What do you want to pay a tree?\"\n\nS\u00e9mordan answered, \"Two nuts, and the number of the trees is about twenty five.\"\n\nMat Janin said, \"Very well then.\"\n\nSo he began to climb one of the coconuts, and while he was half way up he began to think on this wise: \"I am going to climb these twenty five trees, that means fifty nuts. Now I can sell those nuts for a cent apiece, that means half a dollar. Then I shall buy some cheap nuts and I shall get sixty. Then I will boil them and extract the oil. After that I will sell the oil and get ten cents profit. That is my money has become seven times ten cents. After that I will buy fowls, one cock and one hen, for thirty cents the pair of them. That leaves forty cents. Then I can buy ten gantangs of rice for their food. That will be fifteen cents and will leave me a quarter of a dollar. That will do for my expenses in taking care of the fowls. In time the fowl will lay eggs and hatch chickens. I will take care of those chickens too. Then in time they too will hatch other chickens. And the mother\n\n* A short tale by Penghulu Mohamed Noordin bin Jaffar of Kota Stia Lower Perak. No special source can be assigned. The moral is the old one: do not count your chicken before they are hatched.\n\nJeur. Straits Branch, R. A. Soc., No. 48, 1907.\nwill also still be laying. So my fowls will become many in number. Then I will sell them all. After that I will buy ducks. And rice too for their food. In time they will hatch ducklings. Again after a time those young ducks in their turn will hatch other ducklings, and the old ones will still be laying. So I will have a lot of ducks. They will go upstream and they will go downstream all quacking, 'ka ka.' Then people will say, 'Whose ducks are those?' and others will answer, 'Those are Mat Janin's' and in response the others will say, 'Mat Janin seems to be rich.'\n\nThen I will sell the whole of my ducks and will buy two she-goats and one he goat. In time they will have kids, and those kids when they grow will get other kids, and the others will not be sterile. So that in time I will have many goats and they will wander up stream and down stream, people will say, 'Whose goats are these?' and others will answer, 'Those are Mat Janin's goats.'\n\nThen I will sell all those goats and I will buy a buffalo bull and a buffalo cow. In time they will get calves and those calves will after a time get other calves of their own and the mother will still go on bearing. So I will get a lot of buffaloes. They will wander up stream and down stream and they will low 'wa wa' up stream and 'wa wa' down stream. People will say, 'Whose buffaloes are those?' And others will answer, 'Those are Mat Janin's.' And the others will reply, 'Verily this Mat Janin seems to be indeed rich.'\n\nAfter that I will sell all my buffaloes and I will buy a bull elephant and a cow elephant. In time they will breed and after a farther time their children too will breed and the old mother will go on breeding. So that I will have a lot of elephants.\n\nThen I will sell all those elephants and get a lot of money. After that I will buy a ship complete with her cargo. Then I will go to some other country and there I will marry the daughter of the king of that country, who is very beautiful. I will be very happy there and I will play with my wife and fondle her. At daybreak I will go to the royal hall to play\n\nJour. Straits Branch,\nMAT JANIN.\n\nchess with the king's children. Then when I am busy playing chess the princess will call me to go in. One of her maids will come and say, 'The princess invites my lord to go in and partake of some slight refreshment.' But I will think, 'I don't know whether it is really to partake of some refreshment or whether she wants me to fondle her again. Anyhow I won't worry about her.' A little while after the princess herself will come and will say, 'This fellow was invited to come in but he never paid the slightest attention. Very well we shall see.' Still I will pay no attention to her. In a little while she will come near me. Then the king's son will say, 'Mate,' 'Is that really so? I will say,' 'Mate,' says the king's son again. 'Come along and have your food now,' she will say. But I will say, 'Wait a bit, I have been beaten.' While this is going on the princess will dig me in the ribs on the right side but I will twist away to the left. Then she will poke me on the left hand side but I will dodge to the right.'\n\nIn the meanwhile Mat Janin was acting this piece of by-play, and failed to notice that his grip of the coconut leaf was loosened. So he fell right down to the ground and was killed outright. S\u00e9mordan was very sorrowful to see the death Mat Janin died.\n\nMat Janin.\n\nAlk\u00e9sah maka adalah pada masa zaman dahulu kala maka ada satu orang nama S\u00e9mordan dudok ia p\u00ebrbuat satu k\u00ebbun nyiur, maka dis\u00ebbabkan Allah, s\u00ebnangtah ia dudok makan anak b\u00e9ransak dapat khazanah d\u00ebripada k\u00ebbunnya itu.

Maka ispun m\u00ebmanjatlah satu pokok nyiur itu, maka didalam ia tengah m\u00ebmanjat itu timbullah fikirannya didalam hatinya.\n\n\"Aku m\u00ebmanjat ini didalam 25 pokok dapatlah aku lima puloh biji, maka aku jual nyiur itu, d\u00ebngan harga satu duit sa-biji, dapatlah aku duit lima kupang.

Soc., No. 48, 1907.\nPa' Pandir.*\n\nOnce on a time a certain woman named Ma' Andih married a man called Pa' Pandir. In course of time they had a daughter. When she was about six months old Ma' Andih went out to receive her wages as a reaper. She left the child with Pa' Pandir.\n\nShe said, \"I leave the child with you, Pa' Pandir. You must bathe her in hot water, but take care that it is only flesh warm (lit: as hot as your finger nail).\"\n\nPa' Pandir said, \"All right.\" Afterwards while Ma' Andih was away getting her pay, Pa' Pandir put a lot of water in a big pot and when it was boiling over he dipped the child right into it. The child died at once. Its teeth remained wide apart. When Pa' Pandir saw its teeth like that, he said, \"How the child likes the hot water.\"\n\nNot long after Ma' Andih came back from getting her pay and when she saw her dead child in the pot she burst into weeping and with profuse lamentations said, \"Woe is me child, child of my heart, we have been for ever separated by this accursed Pa' Pandir, may his death be sudden.\"\n\nPa' Pandir said, \"Why are you weeping like that?\"\n\n\"Are you blind? Don't you see that my own child is dead, murdered by you?\"\n\n\"I never thought that she was dead for she was busy eating that broken rice.\"\n\n\"Are you blind? The child's mouth is full of flies and you say it is eating broken rice. But since it is dead we must bury it.\"\n\nSo they buried the child. Three days after Ma' Andih said, \"Pa' Pandir, I want to give a feast, let me make ready.\"\n\nThis tale is told by Penghulu Mohamed Noordin bin Jaffar of Kota Stia Lower Perak. He cannot give the source from which he learned it.\u2014The humour is in places unfortunately pre-Shakespearian in its breadth.\n\nJour. Straits Branch, B. A. Soc., No. 48, 1907.\nSo she made ready as well as she could all sorts of eatables. Then she sent Pa' Pandir out to call the Hajis and Lebais and the common people.\n\nPa' Pandir said, \"What is a Haji like? What is a Lebai like? How shall I know the common people?\"\n\nMa' Andih answered, \"Wherever you find anyone with a white head that is a Haji, wherever you find anyone with a beard that is a Lebai, and all those with parti-coloured clothes are the common people.\"\n\nSo Pa' Pandir went to call them. After walking for a little way he met a flock of sparrows with white heads. So he said,\n\n\"Gentlemen Hajis, Ma' Andih invites you to the feast that she has prepared in honour of her child who died three days ago.\"\n\n\"Wee wee wee,\" piped the sparrows as they flew away.\n\n\"The house is not wee\" replied Pa' Pandir. But the birds only flew on. So he pursued after them with all his might until he caught one.\n\nAfter that he went on again. A little later he met with a flock of goats. He saw at once that they had beards so he said,\n\n\"Oh sirs and lebais, you are invited by Ma' Andih to her feast, for her child has now been dead three days.\"\n\n\"Bah bah bah\" bleated the goats as they ran away.\n\n\"How dare you say bah to Ma' Andih's cooking?\" Said Pa' Pandir. So he ran after them industriously until he caught one, which he carried slung across the nape of its neck.\n\nAfterwards Pa' Pandir went on to look for the common people who wore varicoloured clothes. He went on into the jungle. Almost at once he met with a large male tiger. Pa' Pandir said, \"Ho man of the common folk, Ma' Andih invites you to her feast which she has made in honour of her child who died just three days ago.\" But the tiger ran away. So Pa'\nPandir chased it with all his might. At last he got the tiger and dragged it home with him by the ear.\n\nWhen he reached home and Ma' Andih saw the white headed sparrow and the old he goat with the long beard and the tiger with his striped fur, she said, \"Where are the hajis and the lebais and the common people?\"\n\nAnd Pa' Pandir replied, \"This with a white head is a haji, this with the beard is a lebai, and this in the striped jacket is one of the common people: for that is what you said.\"\n\nThen Ma' Andih exclaimed, \"Ill starred Pa' Pandir, accursed Pa' Pandir, may you die an evil death. You call a white headed sparrow a haji and an old he goat a lebai and a tiger a common man.\"\n\nPa' Pandir said, \"Really I never thought that that was a sparrow or that a goat or that a tiger.\"\n\nThen Ma' Andih ordered him to let them all go. So Pa' Pandir set them all free. The result was that Ma' Andih had to call the people herself and only then were they able to have the feast.\n\nAfterwards when the seventh day had arrived Ma' Andih planned another feast. Ma' Andih said, \"It is now seven days since our child died we ought to make a feast. We must get a buffalo this time in order that we may make a proper feast to our child.\"\n\nPa' Pandir replied, \"I will carry out just whatever you think is right.\"\n\nSo Ma' Andih said, \"Go and look for a buffalo.\"\n\nPa' Pandir replied, \"Very well.\" Then he said, \"What is a buffalo like?\"\n\nMa' Andih replied, \"Whatever you find eating grass, is a buffalo.\" He went off towards the rice field. There he found a man busy using a tajak, (a heavy weeding hoe) whose sharp edge ate into the grass. When Pa' Pandir got up to him, he said, \"Ho sir, will you sell this buffalo?\"\n\nThe man replied, \"This is not a buffalo.\"\n\nE. A. Soc., No. 48, 1907.\nPa' Pandir said, \"I am only following what Ma' Andih said: 'Whatever you find eating into the grass, is a buffalo.'\"\n\nThe owner of the rice field then said, \"If Ma' Andih said so I will sell. The price of my buffalo is twelve dollars.\"\n\nSo Pa' Pandir paid what the owner of the buffalo asked and dragged the buffalo away. But the hoe kept jumping about behind him as it was pulled along until at last it caught him on the tendon of Achilles and drew blood. Then Pa' Pandir said, \"This is an ill starred buffalo. This tendon of mine is very sore indeed. And look there is blood on the beast's horns too.\" But he went on dragging it until he reached his own house. When he arrived he fastened it securely to the stem of a betel-nut tree and went upstairs.\n\nMa' Andih said, \"Pa' Pandir. Where is the buffalo?\"\n\n\"I have fastened it to the betel-nut tree over there. But don't go too near, for my heel is very sore having been pierced by the brute's horns.\"\n\n\"I will only look at it from a distance.\"\n\nSo she went to see it. She looked to the right and to the left but she could see nothing. Then she called out, \"Pa' Pandir, Pa' Pandir, where is the buffalo? Has it got loose?\"\n\n\"It is there. I tied it very securely to the stem of that betel-nut.\"\n\n\"Am I blind? I can not see any buffalo here.\"\n\nSo Pa' Pandir tumbled down from the house to look for the buffalo. When he got there he said, \"This is the buffalo that I have bought.\" And he pointed out the hoe to Ma' Andih.\n\nMa' Andih gave a scream, when she saw the hoe, saying, \"Accursed Pa' Pandir, cursed Pa' Pandir. May your death be speedy. You call a hoe a buffalo.\"\n\nSo they got another buffalo, a real one, and then they had the feast . . . . .\n\nSome four or five days after this when he and Ma' Andih were both out reaping their rice it came on to rain and they\nboth took shelter under a tree. Pa' Pandir said, \"Ma' Andih, Ma' Andih, com' gimme 'nana.\" But Ma' Andih paid no attention to him. After two or three times however she took a banana and smeared it with charcoal and gave it to him.\n\nPa' Pandir tore the banana in two and said, \"Ma' Andih Ma' Andih, 'is 'nana 'ot not cook' wa' 'appen'?\"\n\nMa' Andih replied, \"You wanted it in a hurry, so that is how it is like that.\"\n\nAfter that they both went home and stayed there.\n\nAbout ten days later Pa' Pandir became very ill and at last died. Ma' Andih wept over Pa' Pandir with varied weepings and went to call the Hajis and Lebais to bury Pa' Pandir. The Hajis and Lebais came, and after having washed the body and held a service they buried him at the head of the rice mortar. For so Pa' Pandir had ordered and Ma' Andih carefully carried out all that he had ordered. After that Ma' Andih made a feast on the third day and on the seventh day and again on the hundredth day, (sc, after Pa' Pandir's death).\n\n---\n\nPa' Pandir.\n\nAlk\u00eb-sah maka adalah pada masa zaman dahulu kala ada satu orang p\u00ebr\u00ebmpuan bernama Ma' Andih b\u00ebrkhawin d\u00ebngan satu orang laki-laki nama Pa' Pandir.

Now one of them was a coward. Indeed he was simply wild with fright. The result was that his friend, the brave man, was greatly distressed to see his companion's state of mind. If he put him on the right he was frightened, and if he put him on the left he was frightened too. So he put his friend's head between his own legs, and his own head between his friend's legs, while he embraced his friend round the waist, telling his friend at the same time to grasp him in the same manner. The consequence was that the brave man's face was at the coward's back and the coward's face was at the brave man's back, while each embraced the other.\n\nIt happened just at that time His Majesty Stripes, i.e., the tiger, was prowling round the jungle looking for his food, when he noticed these two forwandered friends, who seemed just like some strange new animal with two heads and four hands. He was much astonished and wished to go close, but was just a little frightened. So he went on. He had just got out of sight when he ran into a mouse deer and said to him, \"Wahay, Wise Man of the Woods, what is the name of that animal there with two heads and four hands and four feet that thy servant has just met?\" The mouse deer, who at once knew that it must be men who were behaving like that, replied promptly, \"Oh, Your Majesty Stripes, do you not know that this is what men call Sang Kinot, who is said to have devoured of old time all your grand-fathers, great-grand-fathers, great-great-grand-fathers and great-great-great-grand-fathers?\" Such is the story of how the mouse deer by his cleverness saved the two lost men from being eaten alive by the tiger.\n\n* A short tale by Penghulu Haji Mohamed Nasir, bin Kanda Mat Sen, of Hutan Melintang.

He noticed a tiger approaching the ant heap where he was eating the terong. He thought that the tiger wanted to catch him. His joints and bones all trembled owing to his very great fear and his head was in a whirl. While in this state he began to chew one of the terong making as much noise with his mouth as he could. \"Kerab kerab kertub kertub\" went his jaws. \"Ambohi,\" he said, \"how delicious is this pickled tiger's eye.\" Then he ate another terong in the same way and said the same thing. And so on four or five times. When his majesty stripes heard that he began to shudder and crept away very softly.\n\nA short while after the tiger met with a bear and said to him, \"Ho, Sang Beruang, hath my lord heard what manner of animal it is that lives in that ant heap there, and is so busy eating tiger's eyes?\" The bear replied, \"Thy servant knoweth not.\" The tiger then said, \"Come along and see.\" But the bear replied, \"I dare not.\" The tiger said, \"Never mind, come and let us swear fealty to each other, and let us tie our tails together. Then if anything happens we will both suffer.\" So they tied their tails together, and approached the mousedeer's ant heap very gingerly as if they were going against some very great enemy.\n\nWhen Salam di Rimba saw these animals he knew that they were badly frightened, so he shouted out, \"Look at this accursed tiger, his father owed us a white bear and he is now going to pay his debt to us with a black one. Black or not, bring it along quickly.\" When the bear heard this he was very greatly startled \"Hei,\" he said, \"is this the trick that Sang Harimau is trying to play on me? He wants me to pay his father's debt, does he.\" So the bear tugged violently.\n\n* A short tale by Penghulu Haji Mohamed Nasir, bin Kanda Mat Sen, of Hutan Melintang. Lower Perak.

So he began to jump and the bear commenced to heave. Finally the bear's tail broke off short and both ran away. And that, they say, is why the bear's tail is always short.

Sec., No. 48, 1907.\nThe Rich Man, the Poor Man and the Way the Pelandok Squared the Score.*\n\nThe story is told that once on a time there was an extremely wealthy merchant who lived in his house in the country at his ease eating and drinking every day. Now quite close to his garden there was the house of two people, husband and wife. One day the wife of the poor man was chattering with a friend of the merchant, when she said,\n\n\"Whenever anything is cooked in the merchant's house, whether it is fried or baked or stewed or broiled, then and then only do I eat. For whenever I smell anything being fried or baked or stewed or broiled in the merchant's house I eat with a good appetite. That is how I happen to be so plump, through eating thus. Whenever I want to eat I always make it a practice to wait till there is a smell of cooking in the merchant's house. Then I eat.\" The merchant's friend told him all that the poor woman had said. As soon as the rich man and his wife heard this, the rich man exclaimed.\n\n\"Of course that is why we never get stout. It seems that all the flavour of our frying and baking and stewing and broiling is quite devoured by these two poor people.\" The rich man was very angry indeed with the poor man and cursed and abused him up hill and down dale finally demanding that the poor man and his wife should pay the price of anything that had ever been cooked in his house. He went off and complained to the raja of the country and sued for all his expenses in frying and baking and stewing and broiling on the ground that the flavour thereof had been devoured by the poor man and his wife. The raja summoned the poor man and his wife before him. When he made enquiries the poor man replied,\n\n* This tale told by Penghulu Haji Mohamed Nasir bin Kanda Mat Sen of Hutau Melintang, who first learnt it from one Pawang Talip bin Mohamed of Menangkabau.\n\nJour.

Soc., No. 48, 1907,\n\"The Rich Man and the Poor Man.\"\n\n\"Of a truth Your Highness, thy slave sups whenever there is a smell of cooking in the merchant's house.\"\n\nThe king came to the conclusion that he was unable to give a decision and so he ordered the gong to be beaten throughout the whole country and a proclamation to be made.\n\n\"Ho, whoever gentle or lord, can decide the plaint that the merchant prefers against this poor man will be made the vizier of the land.\"\n\nBut no man replied to the proclamation. At last the pelandok said to the herald. \"Oh herald, what is troubling the king of the country? Where are his enemies breaking in? Which of his soldiers has committed murder? Where is the wall of the royal fort that is in need of repair?\"\n\n\"None of these. But a certain merchant has made complaint to the king, and the king has caused proclamation to be made that whoever will decide the plaint of the rich man against these two poor people, husband and wife, will be made the grand vizier of the land.\"\n\n\"Pray thee, inform the king that I will settle the case.\"\n\n\"Very well, Salam di Rimba, come along with me to the king.\"\n\nWhen they reached the royal hall the king said to the herald. \"Have you found any one who can settle the question of right and wrong between the merchant and the poor man?\"\n\nThe herald made obeisance and replied, \"May I be pardoned a thousandfold, Salam di Rimba hath declared that he can give judgment in the case between the rich man and the poor man, O my lord.\"\n\nThe king said, \"Is it true that Salam di Rimba hath said that he can give judgment in the merchant's case?\"\nThe pelandok made obeisance and replied, \"With the help of your highness' aid, your servant will give judgment between the merchant and the poor man.\"\n\n\"If you are not able to, I will kill you forthwith.\"\n\n\"If I am slain thy servant will die and my lord will be one slave the poorer.\"\n\n\"Give judgment quickly.\"\n\nThe pelandok then went up on to the judgment seat and the merchant and the poor man were called and placed before him. The pelandok enquired of the rich man, \"How much of your money has been devoured by the poor man?\" The merchant replied, \"Full a thousand dollars hath thy servant lost.\" The pelandok then asked the poor man \"Is it true that you eat whenever there is any smell of frying or baking or stewing or boiling in the merchant's house?\" The poor man replied, \"Of a truth thy servant eats whenever there is cooking in the merchant's house, for the smell of the cooking reached thy servant's nostrils.\" The pelandok then enquired, \"Have you ever gone into the merchant's house?\" \"Never.\" \"Have you ever gone into his garden?\" \"Never.\" The pelandok then enquired of the merchant, \"It is true, sir, that the poor man has never been inside your garden?\" The merchant replied, \"It is true.\" The pelandok then went to the king and borrowed a thousand dollars. He gave orders that the state curtain should be placed in the middle of the hall and arranged between the merchant and the poor man. He then called out in his shrill voice and ordered the poor man to count out the thousand dollars on one side of the curtain and the merchant to listen very carefully on the other. So the poor man told the dollars thus, \"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten...........\" When he completed the tale of the thousand, the pelandok said, \"Take, sir, here-with a full and complete settlement of your account.\" The merchant said, \"Very well, bring the dollars to me.\" The pelandok said, \"Why sir, do you want the very dollars? You have received your account and it is all settled. The\npoor man took them away by smelling and you have received them back by hearing.\"\n\nSuch is the tale of the pelandok's skill.\n\nSa'orang saudagar dengan sa'orang miskin.\n\nSakali p\u00e9r\u00e9stua adalah kapada satu masa konon ada sa'orang saudagar t\u00e9rlalu amat kaya dudok didalam satu kampong dengen bersuka-suka'an makan minum pada tiap-tiap hari, ada d\u00e9kat dengen kampongnya itu sabuah rumah miskin dudok dua laki bini.

Paduka Sri Sultan Mothaffar Shah, the first Ruler of the State of Perak was the son of the late Sultan Mahmud Shah, of the State of Kampar, (Sumatra). His former name was Raja Mothaffar Shah, and the length of time he was on the throne is unknown. The situation of his graveyard is at Tanah Abang, Ayer Mati, in the mukim of Lambor Kanan, Kuala Kangsar District.\n\nHis graveyard is on a mound or platform and surrounded by a wall. His daughter's grave is on the right of the platform and that of his wife on the left; his \"Guru\" (religious teacher) named Syed Hussein, is also on his left. Four graves are on the platform. His tombstones are beautifully and clearly engraved by Acheen people of former days. They are broken and cracked. If his graveyard monument is to be renewed the \"ganti badan\" stone (i.e. a stone placed over the grave, extending from the head to the feet, to represent the body) should be made and his name be inscribed on this stone. His tombstones could be utilised again but the breaks and cracks should be mended with cement.\n\n2. Paduka Sri Sultan Mansur Shah, son of the late Sultan Mothaffar Shah. His former name was Raja Mansur, and the length of time he was on the throne is unknown. The situation of this Sultan's grave is at Kota Lama Kanan, Kuala Kangsar District.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 48, 1907.\nThe graveyard of this Sultan I asked the elders of Kota Lama Kanan to point out to me; they all informed me that, according to stories handed down by their forefathers, this grave is in the Kota Lama Kanan Mosque, under the pulpit. I could not find it at any other place. I brought this matter to the notice of His Highness Sultan Idris, and he told me that it was true that the grave of this Sultan is in the Mosque, as former Sultans, when visiting this grave, used to go to the Mosque. I think that a large tombstone with the name of this Sultan should be made and placed in the Mosque next to the pulpit.\n\n3. Paduka Sri Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin Shah, son of the late Sultan Mansur Shah. The latter was afterwards called \"Almerhum Kota Lama Kanan.\" His former name was Raja Ahmad, and the length of time he was on the throne is unknown.

His tombstones were beautifully engraved by Acheen people. One of the two tombstones is broken and cannot be mended and therefore both stones should be renewed.\n\n4. Paduka Sri Sultan Tajul Ariffin, son of the late Sultan Mansur Shah (Almerhum Kota Lama Kanan). His former name was Raja Ariffin, and the length of his reign is unknown. The grave of this Sultan is on the island of Semat, in the mukim of Senggang, Kuala Kangsar District.\n\nThis grave is in the land owned by one Anjang Ibrahim.

The stump of this tree has now disappeared.\n\n13. Paduka Sri Sultan Mothaffar Shah III, who was styled \"Almerhum Hadji-Allah,\" son of the late Sultan Mansur Shah, of Pulau Tiga.

The square tombstones, which were made beautifully, have been in many parts broken, but could be mended with cement. There is no \"ganti badan\" stone over the grave, and I think one should be made and inscribed thereon with the name of this Sultan. This grave is far inland from the Perak River, and on the middle of the island.\n\n17.

There were two Sultans in Perak when the British Government intervened. Ex-Sultan Abdullah was then confirmed by the British Government as Ruler of the State of Perak, and the late Sultan Ismail was styled ex-Sultan.

Skeat and O. Blagden.\n\n(A Review). By H. N. Ridley.\n\nAs the work of civilization progresses and the forests fall before the axe of the planter, the more primitive tribes of jungle folk disappear, to be replaced by the imported and more civilized labourer from other countries; and should these old world folk themselves not actually disappear, they amalgamate with the later arrivals, and adopting their ideas and customs, they become so changed that all that is interesting about them is lost. Many tribes of the human race have thus passed away, leaving few or no relics of their ever having existed. One such race, indeed the makers and users of the stone implements known here as Batu Lintar, has vanished from the peninsula; but we have still with us that simple people commonly known as S'akais, whose manners, customs, traditions and language, have been long the study of Messrs. Skeat and Blagden, who together have published a most excellent record of the vanishing tribes of the jungle folk of the Malay Peninsula. The work in two volumes excellently illustrated by photographs and woodcuts is perhaps one of the most important of ethnological works that has appeared for some time. No trouble has been spared by the authors, both well known officials here some years ago, to collect all possible evidence on all ethnological and anthropological questions concerning these races, and the extensive list of the Bibliography of the subject shows how thorough their work has been.\n\nThe Bibliography dates from 1800, or thereabouts, and is divided up into three periods. The first two from 1800 to 1850, and thence to 1890, though giving a good many amateur's notes and some amount of research work, supplied little more than enough knowledge to stimulate research into these interesting\n\nJour. Straits Branch R. A. Soc., No. 49, 1907.\n2 THE PAGAN RACES OF THE MALAY PENINSULA.\n\nraces. The only representations of any of the tribes in those days were the rough sketches of profiles by Miklucho Maclay which were to be found in all ethnological books. Indeed till about 1890 photographs of these races were quite un procurable in Singapore. From 1890 onwards the wild men were the subject of study by a large number of ethnologists and anthropologists. Several scientific men came from Germany, and many local residents investigated the ethnology and collected specimens of their handiwork, made researches into their language, and took photographs of the people themselves, besides securing skulls and skeletons. The results of this work in which Mr. Skeat took a very large share himself, are well represented in these two volumes. One of those who devoted a great deal of time to the wild tribes was Mr. Vaughan Stevens, a very well known character here for some years, who was employed by the Berlin and St. Petersburg Missions to collect ethnographical specimens of the Sakais, and who wandered about all over the peninsula in search of them. He published voluminous accounts of his researches, on some of which considerable doubt has been thrown. The authors have made use of his work while drawing attention to inaccuracies and improbabilities in his observations and theories. The most important of the anthropologists who visited the peninsula was Herr Rudolf Martin whose monumental work \"Die Inland stamme der Malayischin Halbinsel\" was the first sound and reliable work on the subject.\n\nThe book commences with an introductory account of the environment of the wild man, and his character and relations to it.\n\nThe racial characters and names of the tribes and the problems of their origin are next dealt with. The three types of the tribes are the Semangs, negritos with woolly hairs and brachycephalic heads, the Sakais, dolichocephalic with wavy hair, and the southern Jakuns, brachycephalic and smooth haired. The relationship of the Semanga with the Andamanese and the Philippine negritos is certainly close. The Sakais are perhaps related to the Veddahs, Australians and Tamils. They vary much in skin colour and height, and their origin must\nremain at present doubtful. The Jakuns have been stated to be aboriginal Malays who refused to accept Mohammedanism and therefore fled to the interior to avoid persecution. The author points out however that they are rather a composite group of heathen Malays mixed with Semang and Sakai, and this is probably the case.\n\nThe methods of hunting, trapping and fishing, the weapons, cultivation, food, arts and crafts, social order, dealings with other races fill the first volume, which terminates with an appendix containing much important matter in measurements, color of hair, eyes, and skin and a large collection of Sakai songs chiefly collected by Mr. Skeat. Many of these are hunting songs describing the chase and capture of about all the jungle animals. Most songs end with a request to give each of the community a portion of the prey. This is a true characteristic touch of the socialism of the Sakai community. I remember once being out with some of the wild tribe of the Kuala Lumpur district near the well known caves. In the party were two men and one delightful little boy of about nine years of age clad as most of the men were in the simple costume of a strip of trap bark about as broad as a bootlace, and an armlet of fungus. While at tea we offered the child some bread and jam which he took eagerly and ran off at once to divide it with his father. When given a cigar he would not take it till he had another one for his father, showing the innate socialistic tendency of the race.\n\nBut to return to the songs after this digression. One is struck at first sight by the graphic descriptions of the habits of the animals, their appearance and cries. Some of the songs and charms too have an element of poetic feeling running through them.\n\nIn many cases the language of the Besisi from whom the author has derived most of the songs and charms is a mixture of Malay and Sakai words, the meaning of some of the latter being obscure. Mr. Skeat has translated them as literally and carefully as may be, though perhaps it might have been better not to have called the Kijang, the Roedeer, or if no other translation was to be found, to have explained what the ani-\n\nH.M.S.O., No. 48, 1907.\nmal really was, but its common name of Muntjac is fairly well known. Here and there in the songs and charms we see words and names of places of quite modern origin, such as Tanjong Pagar, Singapore, Telasih, (the Hindu Tulsi) for the Basil plant known to Malay as Selasih, and this has been commented on by one reviewer as somewhat discrediting the songs, but such innovations in folk song occur in many nations, having drifted in later perhaps than the original song was written.\n\nA long list of names of people is given, many of which are not translated but among them are such poetic ones as Blossom, Convolvulus, Earth, Wind, Star, Butterfly, and Father of Leaf for boys, and White, Quick, Mother of Grass, Little One and Handmaid for girls.\n\nThe second volume opens with accounts of customs and beliefs. The Semangs acknowledge two deities, Kari and Ple but there seems to be no cult of these gods who are rather shadowy beings. The Sakais have a similar deity who however was probably of Malay or Arabic origin. There are however numerous demons and spirits, which are feared and have to be kept off by charms, as in all races of the world. The creation legends seem to be mainly original. In Semang and Jakun mythology man multiplied so fast, being immortal, that the earth was overcrowded, and Kari according to the Semangs slew them with his fiery breath, while according to the Jakuns, Tuan dibawah their deity turned half of them into trees. But this check on the population being insufficient death was instituted as a relief. The Jakuns appear to have anticipated the discovery of evolution in ascribing the origin of mankind to a pair of white apes, which is curious, especially in view of the fact that the ape specified, the wawa (Hylobates) is generally considered the most nearly related to man of any of the apes.\n\nThe charms, ceremonies, traditional sales, dances, and such subjects are fully dealt with, and the last part of the book deals with the language, the special task of Mr. Blagden, than whom it would be difficult to find a better authority. A vocabulary of the dialects is given at the end.\n\nThe amount of research which this work must have entailed has been extremely large, and the authors have spared\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nno pains to get together everything that has been recorded in\nthe various journals and works on the subject of these strange\nraces, besides adding extensively from their own observations.\nThey have collected too a very fine series of photographs of\nthe different races, and added many of the weapons, houses,\ndress, traps, and other objects, so that the whole work gives\na very full and graphic view of one of the most interesting and\nleast known of the peoples of the earth. When one looks back\nfor a comparatively few years ago in ethnological and\nanthropological works to see what was known about this people,\nand sees what poor and often inaccurate accounts we then had,\nand find the only existing portraits of any of the races were\nMiklucho Maclay's rough sketches, one can appreciate the\nvalue of this work, and the immense labour of the authors in\ncompiling it, and they are heartily to be congratulated on the\nresults.\n\nAs they very pertinently point out in the introduction to\nthe work there is great need of a thorough survey of the whole\nPeninsula from both a geographical and ethnological point of\nview by the local Governments. The Governments of French\nIndo-china, the Dutch Indies and the American Philippines\nhave published and are still publishing excellent works, beauti-\nfully illustrated, on the ethnology, geography, and all branches\nof science of the colonies under their control. The British\nnation with larger, richer and more important colonies, for\nsome reason not very clear to anyone, has practically done\nnothing at all for the advancement of knowledge of its vast\nempire. The whole of this work has been left to enthusiastic\nprivate persons who devote their time and money to such work.\nThis apathy must be much regretted by all who have the\ncause of science and progress at heart.\n\nR. A. Soc., No 49, 1907.\nOn Tally Sticks and Strings in Borneo.\n\nBy Dr. Hose and J. Hewitt.\n\nAmongst the natives of Sarawak, notched sticks and strings are in common use for keeping record of contracts. To some of the various tribes the custom is one of antiquity whilst in other cases e.g. the Sea Dayaks, it is certainly a new idea borrowed from their neighbours.\n\nIf a Malanau undertakes to meet another person in a definite number of days he ties up a piece of string into as many knots as there are days before the fulfilment of his engagement; as each day passes by he unties a knot. The same people often appear in the debt courts carrying a knotted string or rotan and explaining that each knot represents a debt of one pasu of lemanta (8 gallons of raw sago). On one occasion a Malanau produced in the debt court a stick notched on two sides: on the one side the notches corresponded to his debt, and on the other side he had cut a notch each time he had made a repayment.\n\nAmongst the Kenyahs, Punans and other tribes of the interior this custom reaches its highest development. The string is made from bark of the tree known to Kenyahs as Kumut and to Sea Dayaks as Tekalong (Artocarpus sp.) As before, it is knotted according to the number of days before that of the engagement, and each party keeps a string. They wear it on their person tied to the unus, slender leglets of twisted fibre usually from the ijok palm (Arenga saccharifera). As each day passes by a knot is cut clean off. To such people a definite contract thus arranged is kept quite seriously and the evidence of his tally string is usually deemed quite sufficient to relieve the wearer of other conflicting duties which might be imposed upon him by the head-man of the house.\n\nBut this custom is by no means confined to men. Even Bali Atap, a god of the Kenyahs, wears such knotted strings around his neck to tell off the number of doors in the house.\n\nJour. Straits Branch R. A. Soc., No. 49, 1907.\nunder his care, and also to indicate the number of people under his protection in each house. The image of Bali Atap outside the door of a Madang house has a whole fringe of knotted strings tied round his neck. This deity (Bali\u2014a hero, Atap\u2014a spear) is the special protector of the house, and when they want him to take charge of a house it is necessary to kill at his altar a fowl or pig, the blood of the sacrifice being sprinkled over the head of the wooden image of the god and on those persons of the assembled crowd, who wish for his protection; in some cases however an egg in a cleft stick has to suffice as the offering. To the Kenyah or Punan the tying of the knot for Bali Atap has a deep significance: it means to them the sealing of a fixed contract. They will only tie such knots when they receive an omen from Bali Atap sufficiently favourable to justify them in assuming that the god is willing to make the agreement with them. The actual manner of obtaining such an omen is as follows: a man fixes up two vertical poles in the ground and on the top of these and again two feet below he attaches horizontal poles; then he sits down behind the square thus formed and looks through it to the area of sky beyond. At this part of the ceremony the above mentioned sacrifice is made. And now, after waiting perhaps for hours, if a hawk soars in this patch of sky in a direction from right to left, he knows that this hawk will carry his message to Bali Atap, and seeing it he waves a fire brand in the air towards the flying bird at the same time loudly shouting the message which is carried upwards in the ascending smoke to the hawk. Thus being assured that Bali Atap has been willing to receive and hence is favourable to his request he completes the ceremony by tying the knotted string to the image of the god as a seal to the agreement just made between Bali Atap and the man.\n\nThe same idea in the tying of a knot is met with in entirely different ceremonies of which we may mention one example. It is held by Kenyahs that when a person falls sick his soul leaves the body and to heal the patient all that is necessary is the return of the soul. The witch doctor (Dayong) in charge of the case obtains assistance from the next world and thus is able to persuade the erring soul to return. In the ceremony\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nthe Dayong affects the motions of a person going along journey\u2014paddling a boat for instance\u2014chanting all the time and accompanied in the chorus by the people who repeat over and over again the words 'Bali Dayong;' then returning with the soul he with the assistance of a fowl or pig waives it back into the body. And now, when safely in and the fees paid, the Dayong knots round the patient's wrist with a string of 'Daun silat' (leaf of a Licuala palm) and thus ties in the soul and at the same time completes the undertaking. During this time however the soul of the Dayong has been absent from his body and at this stage to the cries of 'Mulai Mulai' (Come home, come home) from the crowd it re-enters, the man himself suddenly relapsing from a quivering hissing maniac into a rational being who, as if just awakening from a sleep, takes his seat unconcernedly amongst the crowd.\n\nTally sticks also are very much used by Kenyahs, Punans, and other inland tribes (but not Kayans) who have not come in contact with more civilised peoples. An ordinary Kenyah tally stick is a strip of wood about a foot long, an inch or more wide, and an eighth of an inch thick: at one end is a rudely carved head and hands, a representation of the god. At one side of the stick are marks each referring to one door of the house. A debt incurred by the occupant of any 'door' is recorded by a notch in the corresponding position on the stick. Bartering among these people is very limited: their objects of barter are few, being mainly pigs, fowls, parangs, gongs, and pieces of iron. For each of these different objects there are separate positions on the stick. Excepting in rare cases debts are not incurred between occupants of different houses so that one stick of the type just described is as a rule quite sufficient to record all the debts owed to one man. When a debt is paid the owner of the stick will just snip away the wood from either side of the notch so as to replace the notch by a curved depression in the wood.\n\nThe tally stick is usually to be found hung up near the fireplace where it becomes smoked and blackened with age: such a stick would be accepted as evidence in case of a dispute respecting a debt of long standing, for it would not be easy to\nforge an old notch. A stick which has been kept for years acquires quite a high value as a 'lucky' stick: it is customary also in disputes to swear with such sticks calling down vengeance on themselves if they tell a lie. Kenyahs, whose conservatism is not very strong, often content themselves with sticks devoid of carving or polish and even sometime without the image of the god.\n\nIn conclusion therefore it seems to us very probable that in the knotted string (terbuku tal) of the more civilised and better known natives of Borneo and perhaps in the tally stick we have something which did not originate merely as a means of counting but which is a relic that has largely lost its original meaning of covenant.\nNew or Rare Malayan Plants.\n\nSeries III.\n\nBy H.

This is described as four feet tall, a native of Sumatra.\n\nI have never seen anything fitting the descriptions of either of these two species.\n\nGLUTA.\n\nThere are a number of trees belonging to the Anacardiaceae commonly known to the Malays as Bengas, and all are well\nknown for their poisonous properties. This poison lies in a black resin which is abundant in all parts of the trees, chiefly in the wood and fruit. Several of these Rengas trees belong to the genus *Melanorrhoea* characterised by its small fruit furnished with bright crimson wings, others belong to the genus *Gluta* in which the fruit is a larger or smaller drupe with often a corky brown exterior full of black resin.\n\nThere are about ten known species of *Gluta* occurring in Cambodia, Andamans, Tavoy, the Malay Peninsula and Islands.\n\nNearly all these Rengas trees possess a very fine red timber marked usually with black streaks of the resin and have been known as Singapore mahogany. When used as furniture wood however they are said to exhale a certain quantity of the poison probably in the form of dust which is very injurious to those using the furniture. An article on poisoning by Renghas (*Melanorrhoea*) was published by Dr. Brown in Journal 24, 83, (1892). Cases of poisoning among jungle folk by these plants are by no means rare, a drop of the juice from a broken bough even of a seedling falling on the face or body often producing serious effects. The resin is also said to be used as a poison with criminal intent producing violent irritation of the stomach and intestines.\n\nIt is interesting to note that though the Mangipersas (Mangos) are closely allied to the *Gluta* and contain to a lesser extent the same black resin, their timber is more or less of a yellow colour, while that of the Melanorheas and Glutes is red.\n\nThere are four species of *Gluta* known from the Malay peninsula, one of which however has not been described, and I have received specimens of fruit and flowers of this fine timber tree from Mr. Burn-Murdoch.\n\n*Gluta Benghas*, Miq.\n\nA medium sized tree usually much branched low down. Leaves elliptic or obovate coriaceous with a fairly long petiole, and glabrous panicles of white flowers. The fruit brown, corky outside, with much black resin. This tree has only been met with by my-\nself in the Malay Peninsula on the banks of the Pahang river and on the Rumpin river. It occurs also in Sumatra, Java and Borneo, and a variety is recorded from Madagascar.\n\n*G. elegans*, Kurz.\n\nIs a smaller tree slender and tall, with rather long narrow elliptic leaves rather long petioled, and bright red calyces to the flowers. The fruit is flattened and rounded 1\u00bd inch across smooth and black. It occurs commonly in Penang, and has been met with in Malacca and a variety occurs in Tenasserim and the Andamans. Native Name \"Rengas Ayam.\"\n\n*G. coarctata*, Hook fil.\n\nThis I take to be the extremely common bush or bushy tree occurring in most tidal waters in this region. It never seems to attain any great size and is conspicuous in the water edge of the river from its bright red young leaves. The flowers are yellowish white in panicles shorter than the leaves. The fruit is subglobose, corky, light brown and very resinous.\n\nThis is the commonest species; very abundant in all our tidal rivers, and also very conspicuous in Sumatra and Sarawak.\n\n*Gl. Wrayi*, King.\n\nI have seen no type of this but I take the description given in the Materials of the Flora of the Malay Peninsula to apply to this plant, of which good specimens were sent to me by Mr. Burn-Murdoch, under the name of Rengas Kerbau Jalang or Red Rengas. It is a very big tree with stiff coriaceous leaves 4 to 6 inches long elliptic acute narrowed at the base to a broad flat petiole, nerves about 12 pairs conspicuous on the lower surface, finely reticulated on both sides. Panicles 4 inches long with rather distant branches to near the base; flowers very numerous red and white\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nNEW OR RARE MALAYAN PLANTS.\n\nPanicle and flowers pubescent. Calyx half as long as the corolla bilobed pubescent lobes rounded. Petals linear oblong obtuse, back pubescent. Stamens slightly longer, filaments slender glabrous. Ovary rounded ovoid pubescent style lateral shorter than the stamens. Fruit oblong red brown, a large hard drupe of a laterite red colour 4 or 5 inches long and 3 inches thick elliptic smooth slightly oblique. Dindings: at Lumat (Ridley 7974); Perak (Wray 2290); Penang: Telok Bahang (Curtis).\n\n\"Rengas Kerbau Jalang\" This gives a very fine timber known as Red Rengas according to Burn-Murdoch. There is a plant in the Botanic gardens raised from seed brought from the Dindings in 1894 which is now about 8 feet tall. The leaves are much larger in the young plant, some being 8 inches long and of a bright green. Compared with Sir George King's description this plant only differs in the leaves not being thickly coriaceous, though rather stiff when dry, and the nerves are quite visible on both surfaces and prominent on the underside, the petiole too is not channelled but distinctly flat, but there is some variation in the foliage.\n\nGl. lanceolata, n. sp.\n\nA big tree. Leaves narrowly lanceolate obtuse narrowed into a long slender petiole, coriaceous blade 6 inches long, 2 inches wide, nerves rather inconspicuous about 12-14 hairs, reticulations conspicuous, petiole 1\u00bd to 3 inches long. Panicles 4 inches long much resembling those of Gl. Wrayi pubescent. Calyx half the length of the corolla, tubular split on one side, pubescent. Petals linear oblong obtuse 5 back pubescent tip tufted with hairs, and a band of hairs down the centre of the inner face. Stamens considerable longer than the petals, filaments very slender. Ovary sub-globose quite glabrous, style lateral rather long. Fruit unripe globose glabrous black.\n\nB. A. Soc., No. 49, 1907.\nPenang: Balek Pulau (Ridley 9465).\nThis differs from *Wrayi* in the less pubescent spathaceous not bilobed calyx, the pubescence on the inner face of the corolla lobes and the perfectly glabrous ovary. A specimen collected by Curtis in Penang of what seems to be the same plant has elliptic acuminate leaves very much resembling those of *Gl. Wrayi* but the flowers are exactly those of the above described species.\n\n**Compositae.**\n\nIn the 16th part of the Materials for a Flora of the Malay Peninsula Sir George King publishes the account of the Compositae of the peninsula. Most of the plants of this order here are introduced species often of wide distribution, but a considerable number have apparently not been seen by him, although they are thoroughly established in the country. They are *Sparganophorus Vaillantii* Gaertn.\n\nSo common as to be a pest in the gardens. A herb with axillary balls of purple flowers, growing in damp spots. Common in Tanglin and elsewhere. I have also found it in Selangor at Batu Tiga and in Borneo at Lundu in Sarawak district. It is said to be a native of the West Indies.\n\n*Elephantopus tormentosus* L.\n\nThis is a very much taller plant than the common *E. scaber* four or five feet tall and much more woolly. The stems are much branched and the leafy shoots tall and very woolly. It has a very different appearance from the common plant and is said to be a native of North America.\n\nJohor, Roadside Castle wood, Tebrau river (Ridley).\n\n*Conyza semipinnatisida*, Wall.\n\nA very common weed in new clearings and waste ground. A tall branched plant with small heads of yellowish flowers, quite resembling *Erigeron linifolia* in appearance. Clarke says in his description of it in the\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nCompositae Indicae that its flowers are \"intense flavo,\" but it is a very dull thing here. I have it from Pulau Ubin, Bukit Mandai (Ridley 3807); Johor: Batu Pahat (Hullett); Pahang: Pulau Jellam, Pahang river, Sungei Ujong, Burunang (Cantley's coll); Selangor: Kwala Lumpur (Curtis); Penang Hill (Ridley 10205); Selangor Caves (Ridley 8235). A big plant 6 feet tall. Malacca: Bukit Asahan (R. 12586), and Perak in Cantley's Collection.\n\nIts Native names are \"Sumbong Jantan\" and \"Sari bulan.\"\n\nA specimen collected by Dr. Keith in Bangtaphan is also in the Botanic Gardens Herbarium.\n\nThese three species were identified at Kew.\n\nXanthium strumarium.\n\nOccurs as a weed in Singapore Town.\n\nCaesulia axillaris, Roxb.\n\nWhat appears to be this plant occurs in Singapore at Galang (7085 of my collection), and at Dato Kramat in Penang (Curtis 3455). It is known as Chinkro and Kangkong Kerbau in Penang and is used as a salad by Malays and as medicine by Chinese.\n\nAcanthospermum xanthioides, Dec.\n\nA prostrate herb with white flowers and spiny fruit, occurs in Singapore on road sides, Macpherson Road (8417, 6241), Ang Mokio (2740), of my collection and was also collected by Hullett on Drew's road in 1884.\n\nBlumea spectabilis, Dec.\n\nA tall weedy plant growing in woods. Selangor: Ginting Bidai (Ridley 7216); Kwala Lumpur (Curtis 2350); Sungei Ujong (Cantley's Coll.). I have it also from Siam at Bangtaphan collected by Keith and from Christmas Island. It is recorded from India and Ceylon. The plant known as Chapur and Kupugis is boiled and applied in cases of Rheumatism.\n\nB. A. Soc., No. 49, 1907.\nBl. densiflora, Dec.\n\nI take a stout plant like Bl. Balsamifera but not aromatic which grows on the road up the Taiping hills to be this plant. It is abundant on the road side at 4000 feet alt.\n\nVernonia eleagnifolia.\n\nIs also omitted from the Flora. It is a sarmentose shrub with lavender flowers. I met with it in Pahang at Pekan on the riverbank near Ayer Hitam in flower in June (Ridley 1199). Plants brought to the Botanic Gardens grow into bushes but have never flowered since. I have it also from Bangtaphan in Siam collected by Dr. Keith.\n\nCyrtandraceae.\n\nChirita rupestris, Ridl.\n\nSince publishing the account of this plant in the Journal, I have obtained and raised plants of this species from a seedling which came up in a pot in Penang Gardens, and am able to add fuller details to my account of it, which was based on somewhat weak plants collected by Curtis in the Lankawi islands in 1889.\n\nThe plants now raised are more robust, the stems stouter, more or less purplish and sometimes much branched. The leaves are light green as are the urn-shaped involucres of two bracts. The flowers described as dark blue in Curtis field-note are light violet blue with a white tube and yellow throat, \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) inch long, the limb half an inch across, the corolla lobes are rounded and glabrous in front, but the tube margins of the lobes, and mouth of the tube are covered with white hairs. The two stamens have short thick sinuous filaments, and elliptic anthers. The ovary is cylindric and hairy the style not much longer. The stigma is flat and linear.\n\nCyrtandromaea minor, n. sp.\n\nWhole plant 20 inches tall, stem angled pubescent. Leaves opposite ovate lanceolate obtuse, base acute mar-\n\nJour.

The second day the filaments contract and curl up and the stigma appears at the mouth of the flower.\n\nDidymocarpus (\u00a7 Bacopsis).\n\nI propose this section of Didymocarpus for a number of small species with the short corolla-tube and two short stamens with thick sigmoid filaments and sub-globose or elliptic anthers. The form of the flowers and habit of the plants is exactly like that of Saint-paulia, an African genus, and that genus only differs in the thick conic capsule. It would probably be better to separate the section above mentioned into a distinct genus, Bacopsis, but there are intermediate links with the long tubed I. idymocarpi. The section would include. D. perdita Ridl., D. puncticulata Ridl., D. heterophylla Ridl., and the following new species from the island Pulau Battam, south of Singapore.\n\nD. battamensis, n. sp.\n\nLeaves elliptic obovate 2 to 3 inches long 1\u00bd inch wide, apex and base rounded minutely bullate, deep green more or less softly hairy with a grey green central bar, edges crenate, beneath purple covered with pink hairs, nerves elevated reticulate; petiole \u00bd-2 inches long pink hairy.

September 1906.\n\nThis curious little plant has not previously been recorded from the Malay peninsula, but is known from India, Java and Australia, Griffith, (Notulae Asiaticae IV. 101. Ic. Pl. As. t. 417. f. 2). describes a species as M. diandra from Bengal which Hooker in the Flora of British India is doubtful about because Griffith says that the calyx is 5-fid, Griffith's rough sketch of the structure of the flower is however very good as far as it goes, showing the curious corolla lobes, one of which is linear oblong and much longer than the others which are small and nearly equal, a point overlooked in all descriptions of the plant, and further he shows the curious processes which terminate and fringe the lobes of the corolla, nor is he altogether wrong about the calyx being deeply cleft. The sepals are indeed connate to near the tip where the five lobes are free and in fruit spread out starwise, but they are so slightly\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 49, 1907.\nconnate that they very readily separate with but little force used, and in one flower I found them quite free. In fruit they seem to be more firmly attached. The corolla in this plant is very much reduced, and the limb really almost rudimentary, suggesting that its usually submerged life has caused the limb so conspicuous in the Limnophilas to be useless and reduced to a rudiment still retaining however traces of the violet coloring (especially conspicuous in the bud) so characteristic of the Limnophilas. The little plant forms bright green masses in shallow water, and when submerged is usually very short little over an inch tall; here owing to the drying up of the water edge it is quite free of the water it becomes taller and is three or four inches tall.\n\n**BIGNONIACEAE.**\n\n*Tecoma Curtisii*, n. sp.\n\nA slender climber with wiry stems, internodes 8 inches long.

But even allowing for very rough drawing this can hardly be intended for the common Sarawak species. The flowers of this exactly resemble those of *P. moluccana* Bl. but that is figured and described as belonging to the group of many leaved *Plocoglottis*. No one seems to have seen *Plocoglottis Lowii* since it was first introduced. It is described as having yellow and brown flowers as large as those of *cattleya luteola*. By some extraordinary error Hallier has identified it with a plant which from his figure and description I take to be *Pl. porphyrophylla* Ridl. and J. J. Smith has followed this determination in his orchids of Amboina. No two species of the genus are more utterly dissimilar. *Pl. porphyrophylla* with its dull purplish flowers half an inch across, and most peculiar lower sepals cannot possibly be the plant Reichenbach intended, with flowers 2 inches across, bright yellow with the lower sepals quite resembling the upper one.\n\nThe following are the species of the genus known.

The column however differs. From the side of the anther projects a triangular flap, about half its length at the base, behind this is a papillose stigma. The rostellar lobes are broad inflexed fleshy truncate as long as the anther processes. The pollinia are more pyriform with long narrow pedicels widest at the apex and narrowing to a terete-portion ending in a small rounded disc. The flowers are white.

This little plant is remarkable for possessing a very narrow spathe and a long slender appendage with no trace of flowers on it, and only a few irregular male flowers on the base. In the other species the male flowers occur to the top or nearly to the top of the spadix and the appendage is very short.

The flowers of it have never been described. I was fortunate in finding it well in flower in August 1905. The peduncle of the inflorescence is 6 inches or more tall but deeply sunk in the petiole sheaths, it is pale green in colour. The spathe is pure white, the swollen part of the base 1\u00bd inch long and nearly an inch in diameter. The ovate lanceolate acute and cuspidate limb is 2\u00bd inches long and 1\u00bd inch wide white. The spadix is sessile 4 inches long. The pistils subglobose with the stigmas on a short thick distinct style. They are round, oblong or ovate and wide white. There are no abortive flowers mixed with them as is often the case in other species. Above them are some abortive female flowers. The male portion appears above the tube, it is only half an inch long the flowers close packed crenulate. The appendix is cylindric and obtuse reticulate, cream colored. The fruiting spadices are white. The spadices shortly after opening were found to be swarming with dipterous larvae. In large plants the inflorescences are numerous.\n\n*Alocasia Beccarii,* Engler.\n\nIs an anomalous species in many ways, in its creeping rhizome and entire leaves.

Douglas.\n\nI propose to give a short account of a journey I recently made to visit the Kalabits, a people who had only quite recently acknowledged allegiance to the Sarawak Government, and are quite one of the most uncivilized in Borneo.\n\nThe Kalabits, who are scientifically I believe of the Indonesian race, are an agricultural people inhabiting the large tableland in the centre of Borneo from which spring the Baram, Tutau, Limbang, Trusan and Padas Rivers on the West Coast and the Bahau River on the East Coast. They are very industrious and are one of the few tribes who farm by irrigation, and are therefore able to obtain two crops of paddy in the year. They are practically the same race of people as are known as Muruts in the Trusan and Padas Districts.\n\nIn build they are above the average height of Bornean natives and are well made. They are tremendous walkers (a fact which is impressed on one by the size of their feet) and it is said by Kayans that they are capable of walking in one day what other people would take two days to accomplish. This I can quite believe, as all getting about having to take place on foot they are naturally very adept and hardy at this method of progress. They have however absolutely no idea of paddling or using a boat, and when they were first brought down to the Government station at Claudetown, and saw the Baram River, they sat down in the bottom of the Kayan canoes and burst out crying, having never seen such an enormous volume of water before.\n\nAs a lot of these people had just moved into the head of the Tutau River I determined to proceed by this route, although it meant crossing the Mulu Range of hills.\n\nOn the third day of my departure from the Government Station at Claudetown I picked up Dyau Blawing, the Kenyah\nchief who was going to escort me on my journey. After leaving his house, we proceeded on up the Tutau River till we reached the Tepin River.\n\nHere the river becomes impracticable for boats on account of rapids, so the next day we started climbing up the hills, which flank the river. We were met by a party of Punans, the wild people who live in the jungle, who had been called by Dyau Blawing to show us the route over the hills. The going was very bad and fatiguing, as we had to clamber up and down the spurs of Mt. Mulu until mid-day, when we reached the foot of a hill called Bukit Sigerun Sigop, called so by the Punans on account of the wild tobacco growing there (Sigop being the Punan name for tobacco). We did not reach the summit of this hill till 5 o'clock in the evening when we must have been at least 5,000 feet up. I decided to encamp here for the night, as we were all very tired and hungry. Cooking was managed with difficulty as there was no water to be found near the summit. It was lucky for us we had the Punans with us, as they soon produced some liquid, which they had found in a pig's bathing place and which therefore did not look very appetising; still beggars cannot be choosers, so we had to make the best of it. It was bitterly cold all the night.\n\nThe next morning we started on the descent, and when the mists had cleared away the view was perfectly magnificent. At our feet in what seemed a crack in the hills, flowed the Tutau River whilst all round hills towered up to some thousands of feet. At midday we got through the range of hills and from a spur had a still more beautiful view. Right in front of us was the Kalabit country laid out like a map, and as this tableland is comparatively flat, we could see for miles and miles. Away to our right to the South, were the hills in which rise the Pata and Akar rivers, tributaries of the Baram. In front of us rose up Mts. Pamabo and Murud, which separate the head waters of the Baram River from the Trusan; whilst on our left were the ranges which separate the Tutau and Limbang waters.\n\nIn the afternoon we reached the Tutau River again at Long Taoh and the next day continued our journey in some canoes.\nwe found there. We then branched off up a tributary called the Magoh and on the second day from leaving Long Taoh reached the first Kalabit villages at the mouth of a small stream called the Seridan. On our arrival we were saluted with salvoes of firing from muskets and bedils and tremendous cheering, to which we retaliated to the best of our ability. The chief Ili Bawang received us at the landing place and a sort of triumphal procession was made up to the house, where my escort were regaled with 'borak' (rice beer) and smokes, to refresh them after the fatigues of the journey.\n\nThe people of this village, who numbered some two hundred souls, had quite recently moved here from near the headwaters of the Trusan, and their chief, Ili Bawang, had evidently taken a lesson from the dimensions of the long Kayan houses in the Baram River as he had constructed a splendid house on a scale hitherto unattempted by Kalabits, whose dwellings are generally veritable hovels.\n\nI append a sketch of the ground plan of the house.\n\nA wall divided the house in two lengthwise; the front half was a wide verandah of about 20 feet whilst the back part was divided up into rooms, each family having a separate room. The dividing wall however did not extend to the back wall of the house, as they do in Kayan and Dyak houses, thus\nleaving a passage, by which communication could be kept up from one end of the house to the other, without it being necessary to come out into the common verandah. This passage I found was used by the women, who did not appear in the verandah except on special occasions. In the centre of the middle wall was erected an enormous fireplace and on either side of this was a sort of kennel, in which the married couples slept. These were not walled in on the side next the fireplace, so as to get all the warmth possible, but of course as there was no chimney, they also got their full amount of smoke, and soot. The cold at night quite warranted these people desiring a close proximity to the fire, and I found also that a plunge into the river in the morning seemed as icy and as exhilarating as a cold bath in England.\n\nThe next day all the Kalabits collected from the villages round to the number of five or six hundred, and a grand feast was held; a buffalo and nine pigs were killed. I must admit that although the feast was a fearful orgy, still I could not help admiring the thoroughness with which these people enjoyed the meal. They began to eat at about noon and did not stop doing so until the evening and then only because there was nothing more to eat. All that was left of that buffalo were its horns and leg bones, which even Kalabit indigestion seemed to shy at. The skin I found was being eaten with the hair still on and evidently relished. Of the pigs nothing was left at all.\n\nThe meal being finished, some twenty jars of 'borak' were produced and a drinking bout was started, which lasted till day-light. Whilst this was going on, all the women, attiring themselves in their best clothes and ranging themselves in a long line one behind the other, clasping the shoulders of the one in front, began to march round the house, up the verandah and down the passage at the back and then out into the verandah again. The leader of this procession suddenly burst forth into song, whilst the others joined in the chorus, keeping time with their feet. Although their voices were rather raucous, still the song had a weird plaintive air, which was decidedly fascinating, and to which the smoky torches and wild faces made an impressive 'mise-en-sc\u00e8ne'. The song was\na historical recitation of the brave deeds done by their fore-\nfathers in the days of yore down to the present time, when they\nfirst came into touch with Europeans and the Government.\nThe rhythm gradually got faster and faster until the march be-\ncame a quick-step and then a double, whilst the soloist kept\ntime by beating the floor with a stick. Presently the men got\ncarried away with enthusiasm and joined on to the line behind,\nuntil there must have been a procession of over a hundred\nperformers careering round the house, shouting the choruses\nat the top of their voices, but all keeping tune and time. The\nsong then suddenly ceased, and the men returned to their\ndrinking and the women to their duties in the rooms.\n\nThe next morning I went and visited the villages near by,\nbut was not much impressed by their appearance as the houses\nseemed horrid dirty hovels. At one of these villages I saw\nthe people having a rat hunt. All the men, women and\nchildren armed with sticks were engaged in turning over the\nheaps of rubbish and filth accumulated under the house in\nsearch of the wily rodent, which is considered a great delicacy\nby the Kalabitsa. Whenever a rat was seen, there was a\ntremendous 'view halloa' and the whole crowd flung them-\nselves violently into the chase, frequently whacking one\nanother in their attempts to slay their prey. They also lay\nvery ingenious traps, made of bamboo and rattan, all over their\nhouses to catch them.\n\nI was very much struck with the industry of the women;\nthey never seem to stop working and never shield themselves\nfrom the sun by means of sun-hats or head handkerchiefs.\nThey wear a short skirt reaching to the knee just like the Dyak\nwomen. They are great smokers and are continually using a\nsort of brass cigarette holder, into which they stuff a little\ntobacco and puff away for a few minutes.\n\nThese people store their paddy in one large hut, which is\nraised off the ground some six feet, to prevent rats and other\npests climbing up. Inside, this hut is divided into separate\nrooms for the different owners.\n\nThat night another meeting was held and all the different\nchiefs proclaimed their loyalty to the Sarawak Government.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 49, 1907.\nDyau Blawing then toasted the Kalabit chief Ili Bawang to the rousing tune of the Kayan drinking song which with its rolling chorus was much appreciated by the Kalabits. Opportunity is taken during these extempore songs to tell the individual who is toasted the customs of civilized Government and to make certain trite remarks as to his former life and conduct, which he must now reform.\n\nAfter this was over they settled themselves down to drinking, in which occupation every night was spent during our visit there. I noticed that when a drink was offered to any man, all the people near by caught hold of the arm of the giver, those further off catching hold of the arms of those nearer, thus making the drink appear to come from all of them and so the harder to refuse. If a chief was being offered one it often happened that some thirty or forty persons would collect round him to assist in forcing the liquor down his throat.\n\nThe Kalabits were the most generous of hosts, and whilst we stayed with them we wanted for nothing in the way of food, and every day presents of fowls, eggs, sugarcane and sweet potatoes were brought to us. They seemed genuinely pleased to see us and compared favourably their life under the Government to their former one further in the interior, with its constant alarms of war and rumours of war.\n\nOn the fourth day I received their poll tax, and, as dollars or coins of any sort were unknown in these regions, it had to be paid in rubber; every married man therefore paid in three katties of rubber.\n\nThe next day we started on our return journey. We were escorted down to the landing place by the whole population, and amidst the banging of guns and repeated expressions of 'au revoir' and wishes for a safe journey, and the usual accompaniment of cheering, we started down-river.\n\nOur return was very different from the journey up; there was no hard poling and pulling up rapids, for with our experienced boatmen, these were shot with ease in quick succession.\n\nAt midday we reached the mouth of the Magoh River and here I had arranged for a meeting of all the Punan tribes who range through the dense jungle round here. We found about\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nfifty of these strange wild people awaiting our arrival. They live entirely on the produce of the jungle. Wild sago and fruit constitute the greater part of their food. When they find a clump of wild sago they encamp there until it is finished and then move on in search of more. They work the sago in the usual way by felling the trunk and then splitting it in two, then the pith is scooped out with a piece of bamboo tied on to the end of a stick. The end of the bamboo is scraped until it presents a sharp edge which easily works through the soft pith.\n\nTheir chief weapon of offence and defence is the deadly blowpipe, from which they shoot out poisoned darts. With these they kill pig and deer, and even rhinoceros have been known to die from the effects.\n\nWe spent the night at Long Taoh, as Dyau Blawing had decided to attempt to shoot the rapids below here, the water being just the right height to enable us to do so; as if the water is too high the waves are so big that a canoe could not stand them; whilst if the water is too low the sharp edged rocks show up, making it too dangerous to proceed.\n\nThis was a great piece of luck, as it saved us making the ascent of Bukit Sigerun Sigop again, and thereby we gained a day, to say nothing of escaping the trouble and labour of the climb. Besides this we had the exciting experience of shooting the dangerous rapids through the gorge, about which I had heard so much; and was glad of having the chance of seeing them.\n\nWe started early the next morning and soon got to the mouth of the gorge, where two spurs of the mountains, one from each side, run down to the river and form a narrow gateway about twenty yards broad. As the river above this place is about a hundred yards in width, it can be imagined the pace at which the water pours through this narrow neck. We held on to the rocks here whilst the appearance of the water below was examined. It was a wonderful sight looking down the gorge. The river ran pretty straight at first and one could see for about a mile the water pouring down between cliffs, which rose perpendicular to the height of two or three hundred\n\nB. A. Soc., No. 49, 1907.\nfeet. The man in the bow of the canoe, apparently being satisfied with the state of the water, pronounced that the passage was possible and with a final injunction to sit still and hold tight, we let go and started off. Then ensued one of the most exciting times I have ever experienced. For five hours we simply flew down between those cliffs, without a single stroke of the paddle to assist us, except a quick touch every now and then from the men in the bows and stern to keep the boat straight or to avoid a rock or whirlpool. It was breathless work and nobody seemed inclined to speak, but all attention seemed to be strained as to what was going to appear round this corner or that rock. On we dashed between those grim cliffs on which there was absolutely no foothold to be gained if the boat happened to upset. It gave one the idea of what one would imagine the river Lethe (Long Balek Mati, the River of Death, as the Kayans call it) to be like; although the sun was shining brightly above us still it was chilly and dull down in the gorge between the grey limestone cliffs, whilst the mountains towered thousands of feet above us, and absolute silence reigned, except for the hiss of the rushing waters; and no sign of life was visible.\n\nJust before noon a small cleft in the cliffs on the left bank appeared, where the Maap stream tumbles down a valley between the hills and manages to burst its way through the rocks. This being the first place when it was possible to obtain a foothold, we got out and ate a hurried lunch, the water and weather being closely watched, as a heavy shower of rain would have caused the river to rise several feet and we should have been caught in a trap, unable to proceed up or down-river. Happily luck was still with us, and having finished our meal, we continued our career downstream. After about an hour we heard the roar of waves, which warned us that we were approaching a large rapid, and we quickly pulled into the bank, where, luckily, the cliffs were broken down, and, the pilot having pronounced that it was impossible to shoot this rapid, we carried all our luggage and hauled our canoes over the rocks to a place below the rapid. This proved very hard work as some of the rocks were thirty to forty\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nfeet high, and in one place where there was no way between the rocks, we had to pull the boats up the perpendicular face and let them down again the other side, dangling on to the ends of rattans. This process was repeated four times before we got through the gorge and reached our old encampment at Long Tepin, so it can be understood that we were very hungry and tired.\n\nEach one of us, I think, heaved a sigh of relief when we got through the gorge and had left those grim grey cliffs behind; and for myself I am sure that, although the journey was a unique and exciting experience, still I have no immediate wish to repeat it. The grimness and solitude to which I have already referred were too awe-inspiring to make it exactly enjoyable. How it affected my followers was shown by the fact that, although the Kenyahs are inveterate smokers and are never without a cigarette between their lips, not one of them had touched tobacco the whole of that day.\n\nWhat also struck me was the terrific pace at which the water ran through the gorge, and although I have been up rapids in the Baram River and up all its larger tributaries, still I have never seen the pace equalled. It is accounted for by the fact that the greater portion of the gorge is never more than about 40 yards broad, and the cliffs on either side are worn so smooth that there is absolutely no resistance against this large volume of water. The natives aptly resemble it to \"pouring water through a bamboo.\" When we had reached Long Taoh, we were much troubled with the rubber which I had received as tax from the Kalabits, as it loaded the canoes down too much to enable them to go safely through the gorge. Dyau Blawing persuaded me to allow them to despatch it in the way they sent their rubber through, when they had been trading with the Punans. I reluctantly agreed, and it was immediately strung piece by piece on to a long rattan until it made a huge rope about 50 yards long; it was then wound up in a gigantic ball about 9 feet in diameter, just like one winds up a ball of worsted. Just before we started this ball of rubber was pushed into mid-stream; Dyau Blawing promising that I should find it on the morrow ashore on a gravel bank near the Iman River.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 49, 1907.\nOn our passage through the gorge nothing had been seen of the rubber, so my anxiety was great. But on the morning after leaving Long Tepin, we reached Long Iman, and there, sure enough, on the gravel bank was the ball of rubber which proved to be none the worse for its rapid voyage. I was assured that this had been done hundreds of times with rubber and it always fetched up at Long Iman, even if it was occasionally detained by rocks or whirlpools. Once a ball of rubber stuck in the gorge for 6 months and its owners gave it up for lost; but it eventually turned up rather battered and broken at Long Iman.\n\nFrom here homewards there was nothing of interest in my journey, and after leaving Dysau Blawing and his escort at their village, I proceeded on and reached Claudetown after an absence of seventeen days, the return journey having only taken four days.\n\nR.

Boden Kloss, F.Z.S.\n\nWhilst residing at Johore Bahru in 1905 a specimen of the rare Leathery Turtle (*Dermochelys coriacea*, L.) was brought to me by Malay fishermen who had found the reptile entangled in their fishing stakes at Kampong Batu Jawa in the Johore Strait on March 11th of that year.\n\nAccording to their account of its capture, for several days previously, the screens and nets of their *kelong* had been broken and torn by some unknown agency that at length, at day-break of that morning, proved to be an immense turtle of a kind unknown to them which had entangled itself beyond escape in the material of the damaged fish-trap. For a time they were at a loss to know how to dispose of their unwieldy capture, but finally brought out a large lighter which, filling with water, they sank beneath the turtle; then by baling out the water, the latter was soon reposing on the bottom of the dry boat, where unfortunately it shortly expired and was left exposed to the heat of the sun's rays until it reached me at three o'clock in the afternoon.\n\nGetting it ashore was an operation of some difficulty for it was impossible to grip the creature in any way, and it was not until I had collected a gang of ten Chinese coolies furnished with poles and ropes that it was finally lifted from the boat and up the steps of the sea-wall.\n\nThe weight of this turtle\u2014a male\u2014I estimated as between nine hundred and one thousand pounds and the principal measurements taken were as follows.\n\nTotal length in straight line from tip of head to tip of tail ... ... ... 234 cms. (7 ft. 8 in.)\n\nExtreme breadth of carapace ... ... ... 84 ,, (2 ft. 9 in.)\n\n\" between tips of extended flippers ... ... ... 240 ,, (7 ft. 10 in.)\n\nJour. Straits Branch B. A. Soc., No. 40, 1907.\nIn colour the upper surface was black, mottled with pinky white, while the lower parts were principally yellowish, scantily blotched with dark brown.\n\nThe carapace and plastron presented a mosaic-like appearance; the remaining parts were covered with smooth skin, that of the head being entirely free from shields of any nature as is sometimes reported.\n\nThe contents of the stomach consisted mainly of small fishes, prawns and other crustaceans, mixed with a lesser amount of different vegetable substances.\n\nSo little is this turtle known locally that it was some time before I could obtain a name for it, but at length the word \"kambau\" was given me with the additional information that the term also applied to anything slow or sleepy, such as a prau in a calm, or light head-wind.\n\nVarious circumstances, besides its already somewhat putrid state, prevented me from preserving this valuable specimen in its entirety, but early on the following morning I obtained a number of prisoners from the gaol and with their help got out the skeleton. The flesh, though said to be of a rank and unpleasant flavour, was eagerly begged for by numerous Chinese as soon as stripped from the carcase. The novel appearance and huge size of the reptile were causes of much attraction, and all the afternoon during which it was lying on the sea-front, it was a centre for crowds of interested people.\n\nThough the species is widely distributed through tropical seas (and is occasionally noted outside such areas) I know of only one other example captured in our locality, and this\u2014a much smaller specimen\u2014was forwarded to the Raffles Museum, where it is now exhibited, by Mr. A. M. Skinner who obtained it at Tanjong Katong, Singapore, in 1884. The Johore specimen may therefore take rank as the second recorded capture in this part of the Malayan seas.\n\nA full account of the anatomy of the Leathery Turtle, based on the investigation of a small Japanese specimen, appeared in a recent number of the P. Z. S. (1905, Vol. I Pt. II) but my photographs of this locally-obtained individual\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nare reproduced here as hitherto illustrations of this species have given in general so far from accurate representation of its appearance.\nMalayan Pigs.\n\nA Recent Zoological Paper.\nG. S. Miller's \"Notes on Malayan Pigs.\"\n\nBy C. Boden Kloss, F. Z. S.\n\nOne of the most recent of publications dealing with the fauna of the Oriental region is a most interesting and valuable paper by Mr. Gerrit S. Miller, which throws a fresh light on the varieties and distribution of the pigs of the Malayan area.\n\n\"Notes on Malayan Pigs\" * is based on a quite unique collection of 62 specimens from the Malayan Peninsula and Islands, presented to the U. S. National Museum by Dr. W. L. Abbott, and a small contribution of 4 specimens obtained in Johore by myself. In addition to having all this material to work upon Mr. Miller has also examined the types and collections in the Natural History Museums at Berne, Berlin, Leyden and London.\n\nExcluding the Javan species (as not being yet represented in the U. S. N. M. collection) the pigs of Western Malaya are broadly defined as belonging to one or the other of three groups typified as the Barbatus group, the Cristatus group and the Vittatus group.\n\nIn the first group, the \"bearded pigs,\" of greatest local interest perhaps is Sus oi, Miller, the species which occurs in the Sumatran area, and is, so far, known from the swampy plains of south-eastern Sumatra, from Banka and from the Rhio Archipelago, where, inhabiting Pulo Battam, it most closely approaches the Straits Settlements.\n\nThe other members are Sus barbatus, Muller, of Borneo, with which Mr. Miller finds Sus longirostris, Nehring, to be\n\n* Proceedings of The United States National Museum, Vol. XXX pages 737-758, with Plates XXXIX\u2014LXIV.\n\nJour. Straits Branch R. A. Soc., No. 49, 1907.\nsynonymous, and a new species, *Sus gargantua*, founded by Mr. Miller on the skull of a young adult male from south-eastern Borneo. This, besides being the largest of known living pigs (upper length of skull of young adult 570 mm., of old *S. barbatus* 510 mm.), is further distinguished by having its extremely low occipital region produced backwards to a degree quite unknown in others of the group.\n\nThe members of the Cristatus group are confined to the mainland and the near-by islands. It has long been thought that the wild pig of the Peninsula was the same as the *Sus cristatus*, Wagner, of India proper and when writing a note on the Sumatran *Sus oi* for the Journal (No. 45, p. 60), I stated that \"only one species of wild pig is at present known to occur in the Malay Peninsula and that is the animal regarded as identical with *Sus cristatus* of India,\" but it appears that the animal ranging from Tower Tenasserim southwards must now be separated from the Indian form. It is now described under the name of *Sus jubatus*; and to a form from Pulo Teratau, and perhaps other islands off the west coast of the Peninsula, that is like *jubatus* but not as large, Mr. Miller has given the name *jubatus*. It is unfortunate however that in making into a separate species an animal that inhabits a shoal-water island situated close to the mainland, the author has only one example to work upon.\n\nThe pigs of the Vittatus group are purely insular except one new species from the southern extremity of the Malay Peninsula. They range from the Andamans and Nicobars in the west to the Natunas in the east. The typical *Sus vittatus*, M\u00fcller and Schlegel, inhabits the mainland of Sumatra and the Rhio Archipelago form now becomes a separate species under the name of *rhionis*. The largest known member of the group, which is specially interesting as inhabiting the Asiatic mainland (so that the Peninsula is now found to possess at least two peculiar pigs), occurs in Johore. This is *Sus peninsularis* and presumably the pig of Singapore Island is of this species also.\n\nThe remaining species of this group are widely distributed. On Pulo Nias, on Pulo Babi together with Pulo Tuanku and lastly on Pulo Simalu, all islands of the West Sumatra chain,\nare found respectively *Sus niadensis*, *Sus babi* and *Sus mimus* all described for the first time. The animal that occurs in the islands of the Natunas between the Peninsula and Borneo is *Sus natunensis*, Miller, while *Sus nicobaricus*, Miller, is known as yet by specimens from Great Nicobar Island only. The smallest member of the group\u2014smaller even than *nicobaricus* or *mimus*, is *Sus andamanensis*, Blyth, from the Andaman Islands.\n\nThe paper contains full descriptions, keys and measurements, and is illustrated by many plates (amongst which are reproductions of a mounted *Sus barbatus*), of mandibular teeth and skulls in various aspects, all of which greatly facilitate the identification of the different species.\nMantra Gajah.\n\nBy W. GEORGE MAXWELL.\n\nIn an article, which I contributed to the Society's Journal No. 45, and in which I gave a translation of a book of charms used by Malay elephant-drivers, I mentioned that I had in my possession another book of similar charms.\n\nIt consists of six sheets of stout paper, sewn down the middle so as to make a small book of twelve sheets or twenty-four pages. The outer cover has been stained a rich chocolate colour by the moisture of warm and perhaps not over clean hands and by the smoke of the fire-places over which the Malays keep, in hanging racks, the articles which they wish to preserve from damp. There is nothing in the book or on its cover to give any idea of its age, and Mat Jawi, the Assistant Penghulu of Kuala Plus, who gave it to me, could only say, in general terms, that it was old, and that it had been in his family for a long time. Mat Jawi is the grandson of the former Orang Kaya kaya Sri Adika Raja, and, as the book of which I have already given a translation is expressly stated to contain the hereditary lore \"that has come down from the Datohs Sri Adika Raja unto the present day,\" it is only to be expected that the charms set forth in the two books should closely resemble one another. This book begins abruptly without an introduction of any kind, and ends even more abruptly by reason of the available space on the paper being exhausted. In the last line, the writer started to give a charm to soften the heart of an elephant, and then, seeing that he had no more paper, scratched it out, and scribbled under it \"tamat\" \"the end.\"\n\nI here reproduce the book in its entirety in \"roman\" characters. I have not attempted to edit it in any way, of such part of it as is Malay no translation is necessary, and of such part of it as is not Malay I am unable to give a translation. I am inclined to think that the non-Malay charms are nothing but a corrupt form of Siamese, and to ascribe to\n\nJour. Straits Branch R. A. Soc., No. 49, 1907.\nthem a much more recent period than I had suggested in my first article.\n\nIt is impossible to say when the Siamese first came down the Peninsula in search of elephants. Their own country has always been richly stocked with elephants; and at this day, from all accounts, there roam through the forests, in a semi-wild condition, herds of these great animals for which there is little or no commercial use. It is unlikely, therefore, that the Siamese should, at any early period, have gone far afield in search of animals for which there was but little demand in their own country; unless, of course, the search was one that was being made for the sacred white elephant.\n\nIt was perhaps not until the development of India and Burmah caused a demand for elephants for state ceremonies and for business purposes, and created a trade between Siam and these countries, that the Malay Peninsula was laid under contribution to supply elephants.\n\nThis trade in elephants was particularly referred to by Gemelli Careri, who in 1695 went from Goa to Malacca. He wrote in his \"Giro del Mondo\" (Vol. III. pp. 358, 359) an account, which is translated in Churchill's Voyages, Vol. IV. p. 284, as follows:\u2014\"all the country of Malacca, Cambaya Siam, Ciampa, Cocincinna and Tunchin abounds in elephants of which the Siamese particularly make a great trade, carrying them by land to the opposite coast and port of Tenasserim, belonging to the King of Siam, near the Gulf of Bengala, where merchants buy to transport them by sea into the dominions of Mahometan princes.\"\n\nThe extent to which this trade in elephants grew is shewn in the records of the India Office. The following notices of ships with elephants arriving at the port of Masulipatam, from Tenasserim alone, are taken from the Diary and Consultation Book of that factory.*\n\n| Date    | Year | Description |\n|---------|------|-------------|\n| April   | 25   | A ship with elephants |\n| May     | 3    | A ship with 16 |\n| April   | 21   | \"         \"       \" 13 |\n\n* Anderson's \"English Intercourse with Siam in the Seventeenth Century\" p. 20.\n\nJour, Straits Branch\nMANTRA GAJAH.\n\nFeb. 21 1682 ,, ship with 15 elephants.\nFeb. 22 1682 ,, ,, ,, 15 ,, \nFeb. 22 1682 A ,, ,, ,, 11 ,, \nApril 20 1682 ,, ,, ,, 6 ,, \nApril 22 1682 ,, ,, ,, 4 ,, \nMarch 1684 Two ships ,, ,, 46 ,, \nApril 1684 A ship ,, ,, 12 ,, \nApril 1684 ,, ,, ,, 20 ,, \n\nThe Siamese who ransacked the Malay Peninsula to supply this surprising demand for elephants probably used the Mantra Gajah that are recorded in these manuscripts. But whether it was in the Seventeenth Century that the Malays learnt these Mantras, or whether their acquisition of this lore dates from a period before it or after it, can, until further information on the subject is forthcoming, only be matter for conjecture.\n\nMantra Gajah.\n\nBab ini hendak tiup tentang atau di-bacha pada batu di-limpar-kan pada gajah itu.\n\nIni-lah di-kata-nya,\n\nOm kundanga ding kundanga sai teluwang tekulin dipin-tai rambut teluling di-hadapan tibalulon kakanan tibalulun kakiri sikab piah nenek-mu.\n\nHai gajah aku tahu asal angkau mula menjadi,\nMerkubulia ka-mulia asal mu,\nKau turut kata,\nJika tiada turut kata ku,\nMati di-bunoh Sri Rama;\nJika angkau turut kata ku\nDi-hidupi uleh Maha Risi.

B. Elcum.\n\nI have seen few things so amusing as a game of chess played in a Malay village, with the whole population of the village standing round, and all of them who possess even the most rudimentary knowledge of the moves, \"assisting\" their champion with vociferous advice, and abusing his stupidity when he makes a move which for some reason, generally entirely wrong, they think inferior. The rule of \"touch and move\" is not generally observed among Malays. The spectators frequently will seize upon a piece which has been moved, replace it and make another move, pointing out how superior their method is. Very frequently the suggested improvement is absolutely futile, putting a piece \"en prise,\" or offering an obvious mate to the opponent, but the suggestor is quite unabashed when this is pointed out to him, and the fire of advice and remonstrance goes on until the game is over.\n\nThe appliances for these village games are generally of a very primitive character. There will be probably a rough hand-made lot of pieces, perhaps all of one colour, and a hand-made board. The squares of the board are never marked in different colours. Probably some of the men are missing, and various substitutes have to be provided; and sometimes there are no pawns, and their place has to be supplied by little stones, or bits of leaf.\n\nSometimes the pieces used by Malays bear more or less resemblance to the shapes with which we are familiar, except that the tir, the rook, is generally a flat piece like a draughtsman. But more usually they are much less distinctive in shape. The illustrations show a handsome set, gold and brown, kindly lent to me by one of the Johore Royal Family. It will be noticed that the board is uncoloured; the king, queen and pawns are all of the same shape, and distinguished by size only.\n\nJour. Straits Branch R. A. Soc., No. 49, 1907.\nThe rooks in this set are not of the usual flat description. As a rule the carving of the pieces is very rough, and it is seldom that one sees an elaborate set like that here illustrated. A set often suffices for a village. It is difficult to procure a genuine set of Malay chessmen.\n\nIn some parts of the Peninsula very few Malays play chess, in others a large proportion of the inhabitants. On the whole the proportion of men who can play chess more or less is probably greater than with most races. The same game is played in Sumatra as in the Peninsula, and I believe also in Borneo.\n\nHow the Malays acquired the game is a mystery. They may have done so from the Arabs, or they may have learnt it directly from natives of India. Neither the peculiar rules of the game, nor the names of pieces and terms used in play throw any light on this point. I give at the end of these notes a list of the words most commonly used in the game, and the languages from which they are derived, as given in Wilkinson's dictionary. The Sanscrit words seem as likely to have come through the Arabs, who learnt the game from India, as direct. Nor do Malay records shed any light on the way in which the game was introduced, so far as I have been able to discover. The most interesting points about the game are the similarities to, and the differences from, the game as now played in Europe, and as formerly played.\n\nThe board is 8 by 8 as in European chess, and the men except for the modifications to be pointed out, have the same moves and powers. They are the King (raja) the Queen (menteri, minister), two Bishops (gajah, elephant), two knights (kuda, horse), two Rooks (tir, a name which appears to have no other meaning), and 8 pawns (bidak, also only the name of this piece).\n\nThe first great difference between the Malay game and ours, and one which entirely upsets all book knowledge of the openings which may have been acquired by a student of our game, when he attempts to play the Malay game, is in the arrangements of the pieces. With us king stands opposite king and queen opposite queen. In Malay chess the menteri stands\non the right of his king, and is so opposite to the opposing king.\n\nIn the early days of European chess occasional modifications appear to have been made in the position of the pieces at starting, before the game had settled to its present strict form. I have not seen any mention of the Malay method of arranging the men, but we read of games starting with a \"tabiyat\" or battle array, which seems to have taken many forms, in which the pieces were arranged in positions quite different from the normal starting arrangement and it is probable that the relative positions of king and queen were not always in early days entirely settled.\n\nHowever that may be, the next variation between Malay chess and ours is certainly a survival of a rule, now dead, which prevailed at one time in Europe.\n\nThe Malay king, provided he has not been checked or moved, has the privilege of once leaping like a knight, or of moving over two squares whether another piece intervenes a not, laterally but not forward or diagonally. He can thus practically castle, but in two moves instead of one. Castling as we know it is not a part of the Malay game.\n\nThe \"king's leap\" was recognised in Europe in mediaeval chess before the present method of castling was generally adopted.\n\nThe results of this power of the king are very disconcerting to a player unused to the Malay game. Thus an unguarded knight giving check can be taken by the king, or in a crowded position the king skips away from an otherwise fatal check by a knight's move or over another piece. In playing Malay chess at first, it is very common to overlook this curious privilege of the king. The Malays frequently give what would otherwise be an aimless check in order to deprive the king of this power. I have not played the game sufficiently to be sure whether it would be generally advisable to do this between even players\u2014whether the loss of one or two moves involved in giving the check is made up for by the king's loss of his privilege. But it is certainly advisable for a European skilful at his own form of chess, but a novice at Malay chess,\n\nE.A.Soc., No. 49, 1907.\nto endeavour to force the king to move only in the way to which he is accustomed, even at the loss of a little time.\n\nA pawn is taken \"en passant\" at Malay chess, as with us. That a refinement of the game such as this should exist among a primitive race is curious, but it is well established.\n\nThe rules of the game mentioned so far contain nothing which might not have been naturally developed from the same form of the game which produced chess as now played in Europe. The curious rules in force among Malays with regard to the promotion of a pawn appear to be peculiar to Malay chess only, and to have no parallel, so far as I can discover, in other forms of chess; ancient or modern.\n\nIn Europe any pawn reaching the eighth rank can at once become a queen or any other piece at the option of the player. In Malay chess a rook's pawn, so reaching the 8th rank, may become a ment\u00e9ri or any other piece immediately, except that it can only become a piece which is off the board; it cannot become a ment\u00e9ri if the ment\u00e9ri has not been taken. Should, however, the pawn so advancing to the eighth rank be on any other file, it does not acquire the privilege until it has played back diagonally a sufficient number of moves to enable it to reach the rook's file. Thus a pawn reaching knight's eighth has to play back diagonally one square, on reaching bishop's eighth, two squares, and on king's or queen's eighth, three squares. It is not necessary to actually play the pawn to the rook's file, but it must play back sufficiently far to have reached it. This curious rule makes winning by the odd pawn more difficult than in the European game.\n\nThere are other rules which tend to make it easier for the weaker force to draw. The king if left alone on the board must be mated in not more than seven moves or the game is drawn. When the stronger force is barely sufficient to mate, or the position is such as to make it difficult to mate in a few moves, Malay players of the weaker force frequently try to force the capture of these last remaining pawns or pieces, in the hope of escaping defeat by this rule.\n\nMate cannot be given by a discovered check. It is not good form to exchange queens unless the game can be immediately\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nwon or saved by doing so. A prejudice against the exchange is very common amongst beginners in Europe. There is, of course, no reason for this, but in Malay chess there is some. The rules as to queening a pawn, and as to the lone king make it so difficult to win a pawn ending that it is seldom advisable for the stronger force to clear the board by exchanges.\n\nThese rules, which make it easier for the weaker force to draw, are to my mind a weak point in the Malay game, which otherwise is probably equal in essentials to our own. It is certainly a pleasant change to play a game in which no openings have been analysed, and in which the player has to rely entirely on himself from the very beginning of the game.\n\nMalays generally open with a fianchetto to avoid exposing the king to an early check. Whether this is the best method of beginning I cannot say. Few Malays are really strong at the game, though a considerable number play respectably.\n\nThe point of most interest with regard to the game is how the special rules which differ from those of other forms of chess, were evolved\u2014whether they are a survival of the form of chess originally taught to the Malays, or whether they have been invented by the Malays themselves.\n\nTerms commonly used in Malay Chess.\n\n| English   | Malay         | Derivation according to Wilkinson's Dictionary |\n|-----------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| Chess     | Chator        | Sanskrit (chaturanga)                          |\n| Chessmen  | Buah Chator   | Sanskrit                                       |\n| King      | Raja          | Sanskrit                                       |\n| Queen     | Ment\u00e9ri       | Sanskrit                                       |\n| Rook      | Tir           | Sanskrit                                       |\n| Bishop    | Gajah         | Sanskrit                                       |\n| Knight    | Kuda          | Arabic                                         |\n| Pawn      | Bidak         | Persian                                        |\n| Check     | Sah           | Persian                                        |\n\nR.

Hellier.\n\nI lately obtained, and sent to the Raffles Museum for exhibition, the playing board and seeds for the Malay game \"Jongkak.\"\n\nHaji Othman the Visiting Teacher of Province Wellesley, from whom I obtained the board, describes Jongkak as a women's game originally played by the ladies at the courts of the Malay Rajas. The playing board is shaped like a junk or boat, and, according to Haji Othman, the name of the game is derived from \"jong\" a junk. The board has 7 holes on each side, with a larger hole or compartment at each end.\n\nThe game is one for two people and is usually played with Tamarind or other seeds, but marbles are now sometimes used. Each player has one \"village\" (kampong) or row of holes, and in each side hole she places 7 seeds. The board is then ready for play.\n\nThe players start together. Each player taking the 7 seeds from the hole on her right and carrying them from right to left, drops one in each hole, the last seed falling into the large hole at the end. This seed is said to have \"entered the house\" (naik rumah) and this house belongs to the player on whose left it lies.\n\nEach player then takes all the seeds from any one of the other holes in her \"village\" and moving as before from right to left around the board again drops a seed into each hole, taking care to drop one into her own 'house' but none into her opponent's.\n\nShould the last seed fall into an empty hole the player is dead (mati), and must wait until the other player is 'dead' before she can again play. If this hole is in the player's own \"village\" any seeds in the opposite hole on her opponent's side may be taken and put into the \"house.\" This is said to be (?) \"a sacrifice\" (mati b\u00e9la).\n\nJour. Straits Branch R. A. Soc., No. 49, 1907.\nWhen the last seed falls into a hole in which there are other seeds, these are taken and the player continues in play, and should the last seed fall into the player's \"house,\" she also continues in play, taking the seeds from any hole in her \"village.\"\n\nWhen no more seeds remain in a player's \"village\" she is said to be \"once defeated\" (kalah sa-papan). She may however, take any seeds there may be in her \"house\" and place them again in the holes in her \"village\" putting 7 in a hole as before. Should any holes be left empty they are called \"ruined wells\" (telaga burok) and the player owning \"ruined wells\" must wait until her opponent is dead before playing again.\n\nThe game goes on in this way until a player has lost all her seeds. She is then \"utterly destroyed\" (mati kena abu). Skeat, who calls the game \"chongkak,\" gives a short description of it in his \"Malay Magic.\"\nConcerning some old Sanskrit Inscriptions in the Malay Peninsula.\n\nBY PROFESSOR H. KERN.\n\nExtract from 'De Verslagen en Mededeelingen der Koninklijke Akademie van Wetenschappen.' Division 'Literature' 3rd Series. Part I.*\n\nTo complete my former communications in these pages upon the history of writing in the Indian Archipelago, I now desire to consider some inscriptions in the Malay Peninsula. Of these inscriptions, discovered by Colonel Low and published by him in facsimile, one only has come down to us perfect; the rest are very fragmentary.\n\nThe first inscription was found in Kedah. It was engraved on a stone\u2014a kind of slate\u2014under the floor of a ruined building which had once measured ten to twelve feet square. This circumstances together with the contents of the inscription lead us to suspect that the building may have been the hut (kuti) of a Buddhist monk. A transliteration and translation of the inscription were published by J. W. Laidlay in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal XVIII 247 (1). Although this gentleman who was at the time of the publication Secretary of the Asiatic Society has noticed the chief points in the inscription which call for comment, I give my own transliteration of it which differs in a few minor points from his. It runs thus:\n\n*Note.\u2014This translation is published with Professor Kern's permission.\n\n(1) The facsimile on plate X. (This paper and plate are republished on pages 232-234 of Volume I of 'Miscellaneous papers relating to Indo-China' reprinted for the Straits Branch Royal Asiatic Society London 1886).\n\nJour, Straits Branch, R.

The second in Anushtubh can be translated thus:\n\n' It is through lack of knowledge that the Karma (2) accumulates. The Karma is the cause that men must be reborn. Through knowledge (of the nature of things) it comes about that men effect no (more) Karma and from the absence of Karma it follows that men need not be born (again).\n\nThe idea expressed in the couplet is by no means exclusively Buddhistic but seeing that it follows immediately after the better known formula there can be no doubt that the sentence must be regarded here as the profession of faith of a disciple of S\u0101kya. We shall find the same phrase further on in another and indubitably Buddhist inscription from Province Wellesley. Elsewhere in British India and in Ceylon it is usually another sentence which we find coupled with the formula Ye dharm\u0101 etc. I mean the couplet in Dhammapada stanza 183 (edited by Prof. Faub\u00f6ll).\n\nSabbap\u0101pass' akaranam kusalass' upasampad\u0101\nSacittaparyodapanam, etam buddh\u0101na s\u0101sanam.\n\ni.e. to refrain from all evil, to apply oneself to the good; to purify one's heart: that is the bidding of the Buddhas (the wise).\n\nThe couplet runs thus with a slight difference in the halting Sanskrit of Tibet:\n\nSarvap\u0101pas\u0101karanam, ku\u00e7alasyopasampadam\n\n(2) i.e. the sum of good and evil actions which is the cause of man's remaining shackled to life and unable to escape from incarnation.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nCONCERNING SOME OLD SANSKRIT.\n\nSvacittaparidamanam, etad buddhanu\u00e7asanam (3)\n\nBetween the two formulas Ye dharma &c., and Sarvap\u0101-\npasya &c., there is no more necessary connection than between\nthe former and the sentence aj\u00f1\u0101ndc ciyate &c. There is\ntherefore nothing strange in finding as the second couplet first\nthe one sentence and then the other (4). The second inscrip-\ntion in which the couplet aj\u00f1\u0101ndc &c., is found, was dug up by\nColonel Low in the North of Province Wellesley (5). The\ninscribed stone seems to have been the upper part of a column.\nOn a copy of this ancient record which was published in 1835\nwithout any explanation (6) can be seen the representation of\na st\u016bpa, the under part of which is formed by a sphere and\nnot as usually by a hemisphere. Above the sphere rises a row\nof so-called umbrellas. On either side stands a line of writing.\nOn the right side can be read:\u2014\n\nAj\u00f1\u0101n\u0101o ciyate karmma janmanah karmma k\u0101rana (m)\n\nOf the writing on the left side I can only make out the\nword j\u00f1\u0101na (7) Fortunately what is left is sufficient proof that\nthe inscription, apart from certain differences in spelling, is\nidentical with the second couplet on the Kedah stone. That\nstone reads janmana with a 'JibvAmalilya' whilst the in-\nscription on the pillar spells the same words with a 'visarga.'\n\nBesides this two-lined verse the pillar has also another\ninscription along the edge. Beginning from the top on the\nright-hand side we can recognise the inscription given in\nfacsimile on Plate IV in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic\nSociety of Bengal XVII 2 and numbered 8 (8) It runs:\u2014\n\n(3) See Csoma K\u00f6r\u00f6si in J.

The words following these cannot be made out with certainty, possibly sya (sign of genitive) d\u0101nam (gift) or deyadharmah (pious donation). Even less can we decide if anything was written on the broken foot of the pillar.\n\nOn the left hand side beginning at the top we read\u2014Sarvvena prak\u0101rena sarvvasm\u0101t sarvvath\u0101 sarvva\u2014Then follows a gap until at the end of a second line we see:\n\nSiddhay\u0101nasanna.\n\nWhat is left of the first line can be translated word for word: 'In every way, from every thing, in every respect, all'\u2026. Siddhay\u0101nasanna might mean 'who has performed a successful journey' but it is impossible to decide with certainty that that is the meaning; too much of the sentence is missing to allow of its restoration to its original form.\n\nDespite the incompleteness of these inscriptions which all appear to be by the same hand it is probable that the monument is the gift of a pious Buddhist sea-trader to a temple. As regards the man's residence, Raktamrittika i.e. Red-earth I would remark that the Chinese accounts make frequent mention of a port in the Gulf of Siam Chih-tu 'Red-earth' (see Groeneveldt in Verhand: Batav: Genootschap XXXIX8 2-101) (10) That is probably the place meant.\n\nThe style of writing of Buddhagupta's inscription agrees exactly with the type found in Wenggi and in Tjampda in West Java. The agreement is so striking that I have no hesitation in regarding the inscriptions from Wenggi, Tjampa and\n\n(9) Mrittika is a misspelling for mrittika. A similar mistake is found in kritwa in an inscription at Ajanta (Pl. XXI in No. 9 of the Archaeological Survey of Western India by J. Burgess Cp. No. 10 page 78 inscrip. 7) and elsewhere. The mistake is explained by the fact that in many parts of India r is pronounced as ri.\n\n(10) Misc. papers relating to Indo-China Second Series Vol. I page 205, 242.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nProvince Wellesley as being of approximately the same date i.e. as belonging to the same century. The inscriptions from Wenggi were determined by Burnell\u2014too early lost to science! \u2014as being of the fourth century (11) and in my opinion, (the grounds for which I have already published) the views of that scholar cannot be far wrong. I should therefore give the date of Buddhagupta's inscription as being roughly 400 A.D. (12) It is undoubtedly the oldest Buddhist fragment yet found in these parts unless indeed the Kedah inscription is given the preference. In view of the fact that the characters in the two inscriptions notably differ\u2014especially in the ka and na and that the difference in type points to different places of origin, a comparison of the two can lead to no reliable conclusion.\n\nDifferent again is the type of some of the rock-inscriptions at Tokun, a place lying in the middle of Province Wellesleys. The seven fragments copied by Colonel Low and published on Plate IV (13) of the Journal mentioned are so small and, in part, so indistinct that they have no value except as contributions to palaeography.\n\nNo. 1 I can decipher in part only. It begins with sarvva which is written quite distinctly and in nearly the same type of characters as is Buddhagupta's inscription. The word following seems to represent dr\u00e1ma or dr\u00e1mam\u2014monastery-garden. The remaining few groups of letters are indecipherable.\n\nNo. 2 is in different characters which seem to me, judging from the great development of the vowel-sign for i. to be not older than the 6th century. The type reminds me of that\n\n(11) South Indian Palaeography Pl. XX and XXI.\n\n(12) The oldest inscriptions in the Talaing Country in Pegu are in the same Wenggi-type and according to Dr. E.

The two first words are quite clear; they are prathame vayasi i.e. 'in time of youth.' The reading of the next two groups of letters which stand in the same line, is however uncertain. I would read navvi since this combination is intelligible. The second line I can make nothing of; the three last groups of letters might, allowing for defective writing, represent dividham.\n\nThe two first letter-groups in No. 4 are jaya. In No. 5 I read with some diffidence 48. No. 6 might represent siddhi.\n\nThese fragments of inscriptions from Tokun do not, like those from Kedah and from the temple ruins in Province Wellesley, bear a clear stamp of Buddhist origin. The most noteworthy point of this respect is the word \u0101r\u0101ma\u2014the reading of which is unfortunately not beyond doubt. Fortunately it is clear from the other inscriptions that Buddhist establishments existed in the Malay Peninsula at the period to which the earliest Brahman and Hindu remains in Western Java are referred.\n\nWith the exception of the inscriptions mentioned no others have, I believe, been found in the Malay Peninsula itself, but one which formerly stood on a large rock at the entrance of Singapore River, is worthy of description. In the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal for 1837 (14) there is a drawing of this ancient record which shews that even then it had suffered considerably. Later on, shortly previous to the year 1848, the stone was apparently removed and so damaged that a few years later only fragments of it could be found. Mr. Laidlay so far succeeded in deciphering some of the pieces that he was able to give a facsimile. He rightly recognised the Kawi characters in the writing and he came to the conclusion that the language of the inscription was also Kawi. This conclusion was certainly legitimate though Mr. Laidlay could not have known that the Kawi alphabet was at one time used in Java for Sanskrit inscriptions.\n\n(14) (Misc. Papers Indo-China Vol. Igepa 219).\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nCONCERNING SOME OLD SANSKRIT.\n\nI have attempted to decipher the three fragments published by Mr. Laidlay and to determine the language of the inscription but I must confess that I have not succeeded. Most of the characters can be recognised singly but the gaps are so numerous that no words can be positively recognised. Thus I read in the third line of figure 1 the letter-groups saligalasayananara; in the second line of figure 2 ya-amanavana; in the third line kesarabharala in the sixth line of figure 3 yadalama. Granted that no vowel-marks and Anussvara's have been omitted in the facsimile, I see no chance of so dividing these letter-groups as to make an unmistakeable Javanese word. I cannot however assert that the inscription is written in any other language.\n\nIn a work entitled 'The Malayan Peninsula' by Captain Begbie quoted by Mr. Laidlay, reasons are given for believing that inscription dates from the reign of Cri-Raja Wikrama (1223-1236). Palaeography is not opposed to the conjecture.\n\nAs regards the question, which of the Kawi types\u2014that of Java or of Sumatra, the characters on the Singapore inscription most resemble, some letters, notably ma, which in Javanese Kawi differ markedly from those found in Sumatra, reappear in their Javanese form on the Singapore stone and I therefore believe that we must assign the inscription to the Javanese type. Ma is the most characteristic letter in these alphabets since it is different both in later Cambodian in the time of Suryavarman (15) and in the Sumatran Kawi. On the other hand the form for sa is common to both Sumatran and Javanese Kawi and different in the later Cambodian.\n\nIt is to be feared that the Singapore record has been damaged beyond hope of restoration; so much the more reason for fixing our attention on the little of it that remains in transcription.\n\n(15) In my paper on the Koetei inscription, I assumed on the strength of one date that Suryawarman reigned in the 8th century of Caka; it appears however from the investigations of Messrs. Aymonier and Bergaigne that this date is two centuries too early, see the remarks of the latter savant in the Journal Asiatique (February March 1882) Note 4.\n\nR. A.

GEORGE MAXWELL.\n\nI have found in an old note book the following jottings of folk lore picked up by me at various times from Pa' Senik, an old Kelantan Malay now resident in Kinta. They are mere trivial disconnected scraps, but are perhaps worth recording.\n\n* * * *\n\n\"When one leaves the house to go hunting deer, one ought, in order to avert from oneself any evil consequences, to repeat this mantra,\n\n\"Bukan aku yang memburu,\n\"Pawang Do Resat yang memburu.\"\n\nPa' Senik was unable to tell me anything about Pawang Do Resat or his connection with deer, but supplied the following information about deer generally.\n\n\"The first hunter of rusa was Pa' Chu Seming.* Upon his death, which took place in the rimba he became a hantu rusa.\n\n\"His son Jitan died in the bluker, and likewise became a hantu. He looks after the kijang, pelandok and jungle fowl.\n\n\"Nang Peluntong Chai was the wife of Pa' Chu Seming. She died in the padang. It is she who sends the deer away before a drive begins, if the preliminary propitiatory ceremonies have not been duly performed.\n\n\"After the death of these three, the next hunters of deer were Cho Resat, Do Resat, Pran Ali, Pran Rasu, Pran Maiar and Putri Bongsu.\"\n\n*Another account, recorded in considerable detail in a Ms. (written by a Perak Malay) which I hope to have ready for the next number of this journal, makes out that Pa' Chu Seming became the Hantu Pemburu, the Great Spectral Huntsman.\n\nJour.

(Some Malays tell you that the batu lintar is a weapon which the Jins hurl at one another in their fights). Pa' Senik supplemented this account by saying that it is dangerous to keep in one's house a perfect batu lintar as it has life. A batu lintar that has been chipped in any way is however dead, and therefore harmless.

Abbott.\n\n(See Plate I, fig. 2).\n\nAs no one seems to have noticed the use of bark canoes in Malaya, the following note may be of interest:\n\nIn July, 1902, during a trip up the Rumpin River in Pahang, I saw the Jakuns using some roughly made canoes of bark. It was meranti bark as well as I can remember. Their use was said to be confined to the Jekati and Keratong tributaries of the Ulu Rumpin.\n\nThey were but little trouble to make and the Jakuns brought down large cargoes of Rattans and other jungle produce in them. They did not always take the trouble to take them back up stream again, or to repair them when split or damaged.\n\nI did not measure any of these \"rapako,\" as they are called in the Rumpin, but they were 4 or 5 metres long.\n\nI sent a specimen to the National Museum in Washington, but it warped very much out of shape when drying.\n\nThe bark is removed from the tree in one large sheet. The ends are cut square and stitched up with small rattan.\n\nRibs are placed transversely about 18 inches apart, and straight sticks are lashed transversely across at corresponding places to hold the sides in position. A large split rattan encloses the edge of the gunwale. The sewn ends are freely cauled with mud or clay.\n\nIn July 1907, I found similar canoes in use among the Dyaks of the Semundung and Ulu Sempang Rivers, West Borneo. Slightly more roughly made if possible\u2014a thick spongy bark is used containing much resin(?). The same bark is much used as flooring by Malays and Dyaks. The Malays said it was the bark of bintangor batu (?)\n\nJour, Straits Branch, R. A. Soc., No. 49, 1907.\nThe Dyaks dispense with the split rattan along the gunwales, as they use a much stronger and thicker bark than the Jakuns. These canoes in no way compare with the elaborate birch bark structures of the North American Amerindo, but they are very easily and quickly made. I was told that two Dyaks could make a large canoe in half a day. The Dyaks had no special name for them\u2014they used a term which I can't recall, but it meant only bark canoe (according to the Malays).\nTin Coins from Brunei.\nTin and Lead Coins from Brunei.\n\nBy R. Hanitsch, Ph.D.\n\nWith Plate III.\n\nThe curious tin and lead coins from Brunei, Borneo, described below, were, with one exception, exhibited at the Kuala Kangsar Agricultural Show, August, 1907, by Mr. Edmund Roberts, of the P.W.D., Labuan, and subsequently presented by him, on behalf of Pangeran Shabander, of Brooketon, Brunei, to the Raffles Museum, Singapore. They had been found in an earthenware jar, buried two or three feet below the surface, at Brooketon, in July, 1907. A number of coins were in the jar, but most of them were seized by natives and cannot now be found. Those which reached the Raffles Museum were of two types only. A few months later Mr. Roberts presented to the Museum a third kind of coin which he had found when clearing the site for the Brunei residency, in 1906.\n\nThe first two coins differ only slightly from each other; one of them is of a simpler design and in a less perfect state of preservation, so that it may be considered as the older one. It is 36 mm. in diameter, 1 mm. in thickness and weighs 5'9 grammes (see pl. III, fig. 1). It is more or less of pure tin, its specific gravity being 7'5 (that of tin is 7'29). Its obverse shows a recumbent buffalo, minus its horns, with erect tail, the space between the figure and the edge of the coin being filled up by circles, cloud-like scrolls, and dots.\n\nThe reverse bears an inscription, in Malay characters, which is arranged in what Lane Poole* calls the \"mill-sail pattern,\" a pattern which is met with on Persian and other coins, the writing being placed within the four arms of the sail-wheel. The division into four fields is effected by a line which starts from near the centre of the coin, runs parallel\n\n* See O. Codrington, A Manual of Musalman Numismatics, London, 1904, p. 17.\n\nJour. Straits Branch, R.A.Soc., No. 49, 1907.\nand somewhat to one side of the radius, then turns along the periphery, follows it for nearly 90\u00b0, runs back along the next radius, and having thus enclosed the first field which is somewhat smaller than a quadrant, crosses the centre and continues to form a second, third and fourth field, within the second, third and fourth quadrants respectively. The inscription is\n\n\u0633\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u062f\u0644 \u0645\u0644\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0638\u0627\u0647\u0631\n\n- or in Romanized characters:\nSultan ul-adil malik ul-dhabir,\ni.e. The just Sultan, the acknowledged Ruler.\n\nI am indebted to Mr. M. Hellier for kindly deciphering this coin for me. Unfortunately neither the year nor the name of the sultan is given, nor have I any other data to fix even approximately the age and the origin of the coin. There were four specimens of it.\n\nThe second type (see pl. III, fig. 2) is practically of the same size as the first one, viz. 36 mm. in diameter and 1 mm. in thickness, and is only slightly lighter, viz. 5'7 grammes. It is also of tin. It may be of later date as it is better preserved and its design is somewhat more elaborate. There is only one specimen of it.\n\nThe obverse shows again the figure of a recumbent buffalo, but with the tail curled downwards. The buffalo with its scroll work is enclosed by a circle, the space between the circle and the margin of the coin, about 4 mm. across, being filled up by a zig-zag line.\n\nThe reverse contains the same inscription as the first coin, also arranged in mill-sail pattern. Like the figure on the obverse, the inscription is enclosed by a circular line, the space between the latter and the margin of the coin containing a series of dots.\n\nThe third coin, found by Mr. Roberts when clearing the site for the Brunei residency, in 1906, is of lead. It measures 30 mm. in diameter, 1'5 mm. in thickness and weighs 10'6 grammes (see pl. III, fig. 3). Its specific gravity is 10'1, that\n\nJour. Straits Branch.\nof pure lead being 11.37, the slight difference probably being due to impurities and oxidation.\n\nThe obverse shows the (yellow) State umbrella, one of the insignia of Malay royalty, surmounted by the Sultan's (yellow) flag. The other leaf-like ornamentations have probably no special significance.\n\nThe reverse bears the inscription\n\n\u0627\u0628\u0646\u0644\u0647 \u062a\u06cc\u062a\u0647\n\u0641\u0631\u0646\u0646\u0647 \u06a9\u0647\u0641\u0627\u0646\u0646\n\u06a9\u0627\u0646\u0633 \u0628\u0644\u062c\u0627 \u0646\u062f\u0631\u06cc\n\u0628\u0631\u0648\u0646\u06cc \u062a\u0627\u0631\u0628\u062e \u06cc\n\u06f1\u06f2\u06f8\u06f5\n\nor in Romanized characters\n\nInilah titah\nperentah kamuaafak-\natan ka'atas b\u00eblanja\nNegri Brunei ta-\nrikh y\n1285\n\nmeaning\n\nBy order\nof the administration\nof the Finances\nof the State of Brunei\ndate 1868.\n\nThe dates 1285 and 1868 refer, of course, to the Hejira and to the Christian era respectively, and Abdul Mumin was Sultan of Brunei at that time.\n\nI am indebted to the united efforts of the Rev.

A. J. Bidwell.\n,, Hellier. ,, S. V. Flower.\n,, Bryant. ,, R. J. Bartlett.\n,, Marriot. ,, W. D. Barnes.\n,, C. B. Kloss. Dr. Hanitsch.\nMr. H. N. Ridley.\n\nThe minutes of the last annual general meeting were read and confirmed.\n\nThe secretary's report was laid on the table and accepted. The Treasurer's account was also passed.\n\nIt was resolved that the members of the society were desirous of expressing their sense of the loss which the society had sustained by the departure from the East of the Right Reverend Bishop Hose D.D., their President, on his well-deserved retirement after a period of over forty years. It was to him, the Founder of the Society in 1877 that the\nsociety was indebted for its inception and for its continuance for thirty years, during which he occupied the position of President almost without a break, till the actual date of his retirement. He also contributed on various occasions to its Journal and in every way possible assisted in the furthering of the objects of the society.\n\nA letter from Mr. H. C. Robinson was read stating that a scheme for the systematic study of the Fauna of the Peninsula had been laid down. The Reptiles, Batrachians and birds had been well studied but the mammals had been as yet little investigated. The Government of the F. M. S. had sanctioned the insertion of a certain sum of money in the estimates for the purpose and it was suggested that the society might provide a substantial grant to be devoted to the same purpose. Eventually the sum $500 a year for three years was voted.\n\nThe officers for the ensuing year were then elected viz.\n\nPresident: Dr. Galloway.\nVice-President Singapore: W. D. Barnes.\n\" Penang: Hon. R. N. Bland.\nSecretary: H. N. Ridley.\nTreasurer: R. J. Bartlett.\nCouncillors: Dr. Hanitsch.\n\" V. S. Flower.\n\" A. Knight.\n\" C. B. Kloss.\n\" H.

Ridley, F.R.S.\n\nAs might be expected in a wet tropical forest region such as the Malay Peninsula, the number of ferns is very large, no less than 382 species being recorded, and further the number of individuals is so large that they form a very conspicuous feature in the forests and damp open spots.\n\nThat the number of species occurring here will be very largely increased by further discoveries may be taken as certain, for there still remains a very large area of the country especially in the centre and northern part of the peninsula which has not as yet been investigated by the lovers of ferns.\n\nThe ferns of the plain country of the west coast are probably pretty well known and the Thaiping Hills and some of the other hill-ranges have been the collecting grounds of Day, Scortechini, and Kunstler. The ferns of Penang were well collected by Curtis, but the hill-ranges of Selangor and Pahang and the low country of the east coast have as yet been only partially searched and that mainly by myself. The northern states on the borders of Siam have been hardly investigated at all, and are likely to produce many additions to our flora.\n\nIn following the arrangement of Beddome's Ferns of British India, I have incorporated into the list some species recorded by him from definite localities in the peninsula which have not been seen by me. There are however a good many recorded by him as from \"Malay peninsula\" without special localities, and which have not been apparently met with again. These I have excluded at present as some authors include Tenasserim as part of the Malay peninsula and the plants thus vaguely localised may have been obtained across the border.\n\nJour. Straits Branch, R. A. Soc., No. 50, 1908.\nI am indebted to Dr. Christ of Basle for identification of many species, as well as to Bishop Hose, and Surgeon General C. T. Matthew, who always spent his spare time in Singapore during the short stays of his ship in searching the forests of Singapore for ferns, with no little success.\n\nThe chief collectors of ferns in the peninsula have been Father Scortechini, Mr. Day, Mr. Kunstler, who collected for the Calcutta Gardens, Mr. Hullett, Right Reverend Bishop Hose, Mr. Curtis and in earlier days W. Norris, Lady Dalhousie, Mr. Pinwill, Dr. Wallich and Cuming.\n\nHabitats. The most abundant and conspicuous fern is perhaps the well-known \"Resam\" *Gleichenia linearis* which covers considerable tracts of country on the edges of forest, and where the forest has been felled and burnt. In such spots it produces dense thickets very troublesome to penetrate. In the hill districts it is replaced by other species of *Gleichenia*, *G. hirta*, *G. glauca* and *G. flagellaris*. In more sandy places in the low country, we find the common bracken, *Pteris aquilina* taking its place. This is probably the most widely distributed and abundant of any vascular plant in the world. It is remarkable too how little this plant varies in different regions of the globe. There is but little visible difference between the bracken of the woods of Kent and that of the hot sandy country of Singapore, the chief difference being the more woody texture of the stalks in the tropical form.\n\nAnother fern which forms thick masses is the local *Matonia pectinata* of Mount Ophir and others of our higher hills. This beautiful fern often occurs growing in close thickets, like bracken.\n\n*Dipteris Horsfieldii* grows in a similar manner over the sea-coast cliffs and on clay banks at 2000 feet and upwards in close masses. It is noticeable that all these ferns are remarkably difficult to cultivate, abundantly and readily as they grow in a natural state. All attempts to grow *Dipteris* and *Matonia* have failed, while the Gleichenias and the Bracken too are notoriously troublesome to transplant.\n\nVery common and conspicuous too are the *Lygodiums*, known here as \"Ribu-Ribu,\" literally \"thousands,\" from\ntheir numerous leaflets, *L. circinatum* and *L. microphyllum*. So abundant are these ferns climbing over bushes and through grasses, that they are extensively used in decorating ballrooms in the form of twisted ropes of the ferns.\n\n*Anisogonium esculentum* is a very common fern fringing the banks of muddy rivers in dense thickets, and very abundant too is the \"Lamiding\" *Stenochloena palustris* scrambling and climbing over trees and bushes. Both of these last mentioned ferns are eaten as potherbs by the Malays.\n\n*Acrostichum aureum* a big tufted fern occurring in tidal river mud all over the warmer parts of the world is very abundant. It occasionally is to be met with in damp places far away from the sea or any tidal river. In most of these places however I believe that it has merely persisted for many years after the river on whose banks it formerly grow has been silted up and now forms part of the dry land. A large clump still grows in the Economic Gardens at Singapore where the original river on which it doubtless first started its growth has been dry land since any history of it has been known, though Nipah fruits still dug up in the surrounding soil prove that at one time the tides reached this spot. I have also found the *Acrostichum* far inland at the base of Gunong Pantai in Johor, and still further from the sea at Bukit Assahan at the foot of Mount Ophir and over thirty miles from the Coast. Most of the ferns however occur in a more isolated manner, though many are very abundant.\n\nThe richest localities for ferns are the wet densely forested hills at altitudes of from 1000 to 5000 feet but the damp rocky woods of the plains are also very rich. The drier woods are less abundantly supplied, but many species are very characteristic of this kind of locality. Such are the Schizoeas, Lindsayas, Nephrodiums.\n\nEven the sands of the sea-coast produce some species such as *Davallia solida* and *D. elegans*, the *Humatas* and *Schizaea dichotoma*. At high elevations there is a noticeable disappearance of the thin textured ferns such as the Nephrodiums and Lastraeas, which are replaced by the more cori-\naceous leaved xerophytic *Dipteris*, *Matonia*, *Polypodiums*, *Oleandras* and such ferns.\n\nEpiphytic species are very abundant frequently covering the trees, especially at high altitudes, but as it seen in other groups of plants, ferns which in the plants only occur on the upper branches of lofty trees, grow at an altitude of three or four thousand feet quite low down, and not rarely on rocks. Some of these high growing ferns are not at all easy to cultivate at low altitudes, but *Darallia triphylla* which only occurs in a wild state on the topmost boughs of trees a hundred or a hundred and fifty feet high, I have met with on several occasions transplanted, accidentally or intentionally to the base of trees a few feet from the ground and thriving well. This fern was formerly considered so rare that about 20 years ago few herbaria in Europe had a specimen, but as a matter of fact it is by no means a rare plant. Growing as it does only on the inaccessible branches of lofty trees, it could only be obtained by searching for fallen boughs on which it happened to be growing.\n\nTwo of the most curious of our ferns are epiphytic plants remarkable for their rhizomes being modified so as to form nests for ants. They are *Lecanopteres carnosa* and *Pleopeltis sinuosa*. The former which occurs abundantly on trees at 3000 much after the manner of the rubiaceous plant *Myrmecodia*. *Pleopeltis sinuosa* has a thick scaly rhizome hollow inside and also inhabited by ants. It is abundant in Singapore. It is curious that fleshy and succulent as the rhizome of this plant is, it is one of the first epiphytic plants to die during a short dry spell. One would have thought its supply of water in the rhizome would have been sufficient to have prevented this.\n\n**Distribution of Ferns.** As ferns are disseminated by the floating of their dust-like spores on the wind to immense distances it will easily be understood that many of the species have a very wide distribution over the surface of the globe. Ferns indeed are among the first of the higher plants to appear on newly cleared ground, if the soil and climate suit them.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nThe majority of our ferns occur in the Malay islands also, and a large proportion are found in the Mascarene islands, as well as India and Polynesia and South America, which is not the case with the higher flowering plants, few of which except some weeds carried about by human agency have as wide a distribution. Six species even occur in the British Isles, viz., *Trichomanes radicans*, *Hymenophyllum Tunbridgense*, *Pteris aquilina*, *Lastrea Thelypteris* and *Polystichum aculeatum* and *Adiantum Capillus-veneris*.\n\nThere are however about 40 species which are endemic, never having been collected anywhere else except in the peninsula at present.\n\n**USES OF FERNS.**\n\nA good many of the local ferns are used for food in the form of pot herbs in place of spinach, or as sambuls with curry, but chiefly by natives; for excellent as many of these are, Europeans are not acquainted with their merits and rarely use them. Among the most popular are *Stenochloena palustris* the \"Miding\" or \"Lamiding\" of the Malays, *Anisogonium esculentum* \"Paku Anjing,\" and the water-fern *Ceratopteris thalictroides*, which occurs often abundantly in ditches. Of these ferns the young fronds are collected and boiled.\n\nFrom the stems of Resam, (*Gleichenia linearis*) are made pens, and they are also used for making the walls and partitions of the fishing-stakes.\n\nThe fronds of the common *Pleopeltis Phymatodes*, when dry, exhale a delicious odour of Coumarin, like that of the Tonkin bean. Hence this fern is known as Paku Wangi or scented fern. The fronds are dried and put among clothes, especially I am told by the Eurasian population in order to give them a pleasant perfume.\n\nComparatively few ferns are accredited here with medical properties. The golden brown hairs on the rhizome of *Cileotium Barometz* are used as a styptic for wounds for which they are very suitable, and the rhizomes are sold in the drug-shops.\nunder the name of 'Penawar Jambi.' This vegetable fur is even exported to Europe for the same purpose, being used not only as a styptic but as an antiseptic in planters.\n\nThe fronds of the number of a softer textured ferns are used pounded up as poultices for boils or sores; such are those of Cyathea Brunonis (also eaten as a pot herb by Jakuns), and Phlegopteris punctatum.\n\nThe ashes of Drynaria quercifolia fronds are applied to the abdomen in cases of miscarriage.\n\nGLEICHENIACEAE.\n\nGLEICHENIA.\n\nGl. circinata (Sw.)

Sterile ascending fronds a foot long and as wide, very strongly ribbed, rounded in outline, and dotted over with hairs arranged stellately, fertile fronds stiffly erect 8 to 18 inches long, 8 inches across, dichotomously branched, the tips of the branches rounded, fertile lobe spathulate or obovate pedicelled 2-5 inches long and as wide in the widest part. Singapore, Bukit Timah on very lofty branches of trees (Ridley 10830). Bishop Hose first pointed out this plant to me some years ago on perfectly inaccessible boughs of a lofty *Shorea* tree 100 feet or more from the ground. There are a number of plants on the boughs, all are quite similar and there are no typical specimens of *Platycerium biforme* on the tree though it is abundant in the surrounding forests. I have only been able to obtain fallen fronds. Mr. C. J. Matthew took specimens to Kew and Mr. Wright notes on them as follows. \"I do not think this can be separated as a distinct species from *Platycerium biforme* Bl. but is a form produced by growing in exposed situations and is worthy of a varietal name. It has also been collected in Borneo by Motley who remarks \"on the highest branches of trees in very exposed places perhaps only [a form] of the long drooping plant growing in damp and shade.\" The plant is certainly most closely allied to *P. biforme* Bl., but I hardly think it can be classed as merely a form or state of that plant. I have seen the ordinary form growing in quite exposed places, on lofty trees and showing no variation. The variety with its short stiff erect fronds, has a most curious appearance, and really looks more distinct from the typical form than any other *Platycerium* I have seen. I note however that\n\nJour. Straits Branch.\nin *P. bifforme* the young branched fronds when first protruded point directly upwards and then first spread out horizontally, then deflex.

Boden Kloss, F.Z.S.\n\nPulo Batam though so close to Singapore and frequently visited by pig-shooters, has never been investigated by a naturalist, so perhaps the following extracts from journals\u2014though of trivial happenings as must necessarily be the case where the fauna of small islands is concerned\u2014kept during two short visits I paid to it to collect animals may be of interest.\n\nThis island is 9 miles distant from Singapore, about 15 miles long and 10 miles broad. The northern side is indented and elsewhere it is closely surrounded by other islands. There are hills in the interior covered with jungle, where large outcrops of quartz occur and the boulders are a quartz grit. Much of the low land which has at one time been cleared is swampy or sandy and very poor but where red laterite soil occurs pineapples flourish under the cultivation of Chinese and Bugis settlers. Many young getah trees (Dichopsis sp.) are found in the forests where roam a tribe of Proto-Malays still little affected by outside influences.\n\nMy first visit was paid in September 1905. I left Singapore in a 10-ton cutter-yacht at 11 a.m., got caught in a squall off Pulo Sambu in the afternoon, ran on to a sand-bank at low tide later on but poled off, and anchored off a kampong at the head of Senimba Bay at 5.30 p.m. The upper part of the bay is very shoal and at low water wide mud-flats are exposed all round. I collected some interesting small sponges of bright colours on them. There were seven houses in the kampong and others building further along the shore.\n\nAfter getting the baggage landed next morning we found a deserted Chinese shop behind the village. This we broke open and throwing all the rubbish it contained into a side compartment, I set up my bed, table and chair in the centre room while the boy fixed up his kitchen and sleeping place.\nin a third. There was a hole of good drinking water at hand and a bathing well a little farther off so we felt very comfortable.\n\nA row of wooded hills ran south-easterly towards the centre of the island, a river debouched at the head of the bay and across the water a couple of miles away were the slopes of a long peninsula.\n\nAs I sat talking to the natives in the doorway of my house in the afternoon we saw the eyes of a large crocodile above the calm water about 140 yards away and I was asked to shoot it but refused since my gun was only sighted to 100 yards. However, being pressed, I took a very full sight and fired from my chair; there was a furious turmoil and the reptile disappeared. The natives said it was hit, and indeed three or four days later we found it in the mangroves with its brains flicked out\u2014a 13-footer. When afterwards invited to repeat the performance I was not to be tempted\u2014it was a case of letting well alone.\n\nAt 3 p.m. I went out with a parang and found a path going up the hills; cleared it and set 3 dozen traps. Coming back found a pair of \"tupai tanah\" (*Tupaia ferruginea balaman* sp. nov.) just caught and saw several small pigs. Skinned tupaia and after dinner went along the shore for pig but saw none.\n\n\"16th. Set off at 5.30 a.m. to examine the traps which contained a number of rats (*Mus lingensis*) and some tupaia, all much ant-eaten. Found this hill jungle practically lifeless as the forest was poor being without fruit trees, but got a species of civet cat (*Arctogalidia simplex*) which was a valuable prize, and a horn-bill\u2014the \"burong klinking\" (*Anthracoceros convexus*). Skinned till 5.30 and then reset traps. Lent the gun in the evening to a man who wanted to try for pigs in his plantation.\n\n\"17th. No pig seen by the natives. Very little in traps so brought some away and set them lower down amongst coconuts. Got a pair of horn-bills and some squirrels (*Sciurus vittatus*) with the .410 gun amongst the palms; both these are numerous near the village and horn-bill steak is\n\nJour. Straits Branch.\nvery good. Some men went to set \"jerats\" for napu and borrowed the gun in order to try for lotong and krawar (Ratufa sp.) and coming down myself from setting traps without it I saw a large bearded pig!\n\n\"18th. Some fresh rats from the coconuts: one appears to be Mus jarak and the other rather like Mus griseiventer of Johor. Went to the Bugis plantations inland to the S. W. of the range. They are on poor flat land and consist of pines, bananas and tapioca: the forest beyond, which was swampy and largely composed of Melaleuca trees, was quite empty. The napu-trappers had no luck.\n\n\"19th. A couple of small concolorous rats from the coconuts. Away to another patch of jungle beyond the gardens but was disappointed as it was merely a small clump with swamp on the far side. A boy brought some \"tikus padi\" caught in his house. In afternoon went along foot of hills after pig: saw monkeys only but couldn't get near as they went to ground at once, which makes me think they were \"berohs.\" 25 skins to date.\n\n\"20th. Set off for the distant jungle beyond the hills and almost immediately got a \"klabu\" in the mangroves near the house\u2014a female cristata, weight 11 lbs. Had much trouble getting through secondary growth and \"resam\" fern but finally entered the forest and found a path running along a deep gully where a Didymocarpus with violet flowers was growing amongst the rocks. Saw a few common birds but no animals, except another lotong which I got. Found a better way home where two napus were awaiting me, both very large and bright with clear orange necks. Set traps and waited again for pig.\n\n\"21st. Heavy rain all morning so stopped in and skinned the napus. Went out later along the ridge of the hills but got nothing. The view of land and water, north and west was very fine but could see very little jungle in the interior.\n\n\"22nd. Off to the far jungle where I saw absolutely nothing but think I heard the cry of a Ratufa. The few traps out had been interfered with by a pig. 39 animal skins.\n\nR. A. Soe., No. 60, 1908.\n\"23rd. Hired a large leaky boat and paddled and sailed to Pulo Sambu where we found a launch going to Singapore which gave us a lift: arrived home 9 p.m.\"\n\nMy second visit to Batam was the outcome of a desire to collect on Bulang Peak. I left Singapore on March 18th 1906. I had a Malay prau on this occasion which didn't sail anything like as well as the cutter and we had to do a lot of rowing, particularly amongst the tide-rips behind Pulo Sambu. However we got to Pulo Boyan, where the Controleur is stationed, at seven o'clock and anchored in the strong tide of the Batu Hadji Straits for the night.\n\nI found that the Controleur, who was newly appointed, could give me no information about Bulang but he courteously offered me the services of a constable for the trip which I refused as a useless encumbrance. There was a strong tide against us and no wind all the morning so we passed the time in filling our water-jars from a well on Bulang, as there is no water on the small island, and in the afternoon when the tide slackened we made sail again, reaching at night-fall the kampong where I had hoped to put up. It was in ruins and had evidently been deserted for a long time but I was less disappointed, in that next morning when I made a trip to the Peak I found the way thither to be through swamps while the hill itself had been cleared except on the top, and there was no sign of animal life anywhere. So we sailed back again looking for a place to stop at, but both sides of the strait had been long cleared and were no use for collecting and as I was not provided with any sort of material to form a shelter I decided to put in at Telok Senimba once more\u2014as I was particularly anxious to shoot the bearded pig\u2014and see if I could not add to my former list of specimens, though the locality was not a good one as there was so much cleared land and swamps while the accessible jungle was on hill sides and exceedingly poor. There are no doubt more satisfactory places in the interior but thither one would have to go prepared to camp out.\n\nAfter leaving the sheltered strait we had a lively time against a strong head wind: the prau, with peak dropped,\nwouldn't tack in the rough weather and we had to wear every time but when we got into Senimba Bay it was a nice reach down to the kampong. It was low tide and there was a pig on the mud as we arrived so I paddled off towards him with the gun but lost his track in the mangroves. I had been at the tiller for eight hours without a spell and was painfully sun-burnt.\n\nMy old dwelling place had been pulled down but another Chinaman had built another unsuccessful shop so we appropriated the empty place as before; and then I had a most glorious bath, hitherto having to be content with a dip in the sea of nights which was a great discomfort but this occasion squared it all.\n\n\"22nd. Went along the range at day-break but saw only \"krahs\": cut a path down the far side along the bed of a dry ravine in hopes of finding jungle beyond but there were only stretches of dense scrub. Spent the afternoon on the mud collecting stone-corals and sponges, small kinds of every possible shape and colour. The kampong women catch shell fish in a rather ingenious manner: they search the exposed mud for the hole in which the mollusc lives and then push down a stout piece of the midrib of a rattan palm about twenty inches long and armed at the end with a pair of reversed thorns, and the bivalve lying open at the bottom of the hole closes on the thorns when touched and is drawn up. Got my traps out towards evening and then watched for pig, with no success.\n\n\"23rd. Found a Mus firmus in the traps; this was not in the last collection. A blank morning on the hill except for a specimen of the beautiful rose-breasted pigeon (Ptilopus jambu). Tried a small island across the mud flats where pig were reported but saw none: the mud was fearful stuff to travel through.\n\n\"24th. An absolutely blank morning in the jungle but two napus were brought in and gave something to do. Full moon is said by all hands to be the best time for catching mouse-deer. Lent a gun to a would-be shooter who as usual swore to whole rafts of pigs which never seem to materialise.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 60, 1902.\nFound that the new lantern I intended to do night shooting with had no wick so made some out of a piece of towel and went for a long walk with it on my belt after dinner: no result except that I was nearly choked by the smell of burning paint.\n\n\"25th. A futile morning in the forest: found a collection of old shelters, Malay pondok type, probably made by the \"orang utan\" of Batam. Half a dozen rats, but all badly damaged by ants. Sat out all the evening in a deserted garden and just before dark a medium-sized \"nang-oi\" trotted up. Fired at 60-70 yards and found immediately\u2014not for the first time\u2014I had forgotten to put the rifle lever over. Pig cleared away into lallang warmed up by slugs: nothing else put in an appearance except mosquitoes. My gun-borrowing friend said with truth pigs were to be seen in the clearings if watched for long enough!\n\n\"26th. Nothing in the traps and only monkeys in the jungle. Set some large traps for musang and afterwards watched for pig. Went for a walk with bulls-eye after dinner but saw nothing.\n\n\"27th. Only two specimens in the traps: had to shoot squirrels to make work. The pig-shooter returned his gun; says he has sat up for three nights without seeing anything. A large trap caught a tortoise (Cyclemys platynota) later in the day. No luck with the pigs again. Found a large centipede in my mosquito net which should evidently have been taken as a sign that the bed was not safe as in the night a coconut crashed through the roof and landed on my pillow (Memo. always to strip coco-palms before dwelling beneath them).\n\n\"28th. The usual frost in the jungle. A young napu was brought in and another tortoise got into the traps; evidently these reptiles are attracted of the putrid meat which forms the bait. A pig had also been caught but he successfully pulled out.\"\n\nThis sort of thing went on for several days during which I got nothing but monkeys, rats, squirrels and tupaia. Traces of pigs were everywhere, huge tracks some of them, and I\ntwice stampeded the animals in dense vegetation but I was never able to catch sight of them and the spring-guns I set were never effective. However I got a new rat in some beach forest, a very beautiful specimen of the *jerdoni* type which made me feel glad I had come to the island again.\n\nOne afternoon I went up the river which after some distance turned completely on itself and ran south. It was entirely mangrove bordered, though once or twice there were glimpses of old clearings. A number of small side streams were probably only drainage of the swamp. We landed on an isolated hill where were paths and found some old \"jerata\" for mouse-deer. The jungle trees were nearly all of a bark-shedding kind but I saw a quantity of the red stemmed palm (*Cyrtostachys* sp.) and collected some orchids\u2014*Grammatophyllums* being plentiful on the mangroves.\n\nAs I appeared to have exhausted the district after having made 49 mammal skins, many of the species reported apparently not occurring there, on April 3rd we loaded the prau and rowed down the bay to its head where we got a slight breeze. Outside a strong ebb set us to the eastward but as we neared Singapore Island we met the flood which carried us into the harbour in time to get everything home before night.\n\nI obtained thirteen species of mammals during the two visits and observed two others, while nine more were reported to exist. Thus Batam is by no means exhausted; for if they really occur, the determination of the reported *Presbytes*, *M. nemestrina*, *Paradorurus*, *Sciuropterus* and *Ratufa* will be interesting, but to obtain this it would probably be necessary to camp in the middle of the island where good jungle may still exist.\n\n**Mammals of Batam.**\n\n1. *Presbytes cristata* (Raffles) is fairly common in small herbs both in forest and mangroves. It is known to the natives by the name of \"Klabu.\"\n\n2. *Presbytes species*. A \"Kaka\" with a white breast was reported to occur. If this is a fact I am inclined to\n\n*R.A. Soc., No. 50, 1908.*\nthink it will be the *P. cana*, Miller, of Pulo Kundur and E. Sumatra rather than *P. rhionis*, Miller, of Bintang Island. These are local forms of *P. femoralis* which, though found in the Peninsula and Sumatra, does not occur on the islands of the Rio-Lingga Archipelago.\n\n3. *Macaca nemestrina*, Linn. The \"beroh\" was said to occur but has not yet been taken in the Archipelago.\n\n4. *M. fascicularis*, (Raffles). The \"krah\" is common everywhere.\n\n5. *Cynopterus montanoi*, Robin. Bats, apparently of this species, were fairly common and were the only kind I obtained. Malay nama \"klawar.\"\n\n6. *Galeopithecus volans*, Linn. The \"kubong\" was said to occur.\n\n7. *Tupaia ferruginea batamana*, Lyon. This new subspecies of the \"tupai tanah\" was exceedingly common. Externally it only differs from *T. ferruginea*, Raffles, in its slightly greyer tail. It is easily separated however by its longer and wider skull.\n\n8. *Arctogalidia simplex*, Miller. This is the Archipelago form. A specimen, the third known, was shot early one morning while it was running along the branch of a high tree. As the people called it a \"musang\" which they said was common I presume that\n\n9. *Paradoxurus hermaphroditus*, Pallus, or an allied form occurs.\n\n10. *Mus concolor*, Blyth was taken in the Kampongs where it was not uncommon.\n\n11. *Mus firmus*, Miller, is the Sumatran form of the Peninsula *M. validus*, Miller. I have never taken these except on the banks of fresh water streams.\n\n12. *Mus lingensis*, Miller. The Sumatran form of *Mus surifer*, Miller. A dry jungle rat and exceedingly common. It seems to begin feeding at early twilight\nas traps specimens are always more damaged by ants than any other kind.\n\n13. *Mus sp.* near *rattus*. The rats provisionally grouped under this heading are most perplexing. They fall readily into two groups which handle in the flesh as extremely distinct. The one division, almost black above with whitish bellies, are finely built animals with very pointed noses and closely resemble *M. jarak*, Bonhote, from Johore. The others with greyish bellies and backs rather like *M. norvegicus* are coarsely built and muzzled and somewhat approximate to *M. griseiventer*, Bonh., of Johore. All these were taken in swampy ground near the sea as was *Mus jarak* which I found only amongst mangroves. *Mus griseiventer* however is a Kampong rat.\n\n14. *Mus batamanus*, Lyon. This new species is of the *jerdoni* type. It is a very beautiful shaped rat and the only specimen I obtained was captured in damp littoral forest. Swampy ground seems the habitat of all this group.\n\n15. *Mus musculus*, Linn. Some specimens of the \"tikus padi\" were brought me by a Bugis boy who had captured them in his house.\n\n16. *Sciuropterus*, sp. Reported; possibly the *am\u0153nus*, Miller of Kundur Island.\n\n17. *Petaurista*, sp. The \"kubin\" was said to occur.\n\n18. *Ratufa*, sp. Reported. A yellow type, probably near *R. insignis*, Miller, of Pulo Sugi.\n\n19. *Sciurus vittatus*, Raffles. Exceedingly common in the coco-nuts where it was very destructive. Cannot be distinguished in any way from Sumatran and Peninsula forms.\n\n20. *Sciurus tenuis*, Raffles. Reported as very rare. I only know of one specimen from the Archipelago, taken on Lingga Island.\n\nE. A. Soc., No. 50, 1908.\n21. *Sus rhionis*, Miller. Observed. This is the \"babi bakau\" of the natives and is common everywhere. It is the island form of *S. vittatus*.\n\n22. *Sus oi*, Miller. Observed. The \"nang-oi\" is plentiful but to a solitary collector pigs are difficult to obtain. Generally one is only aware of their presence by a rush through the undergrowth and distant snorts and unless one is lucky in meeting them in the open they rarely figure in collections. The \"nang-oi\" does great damage to the pineapple plantations and is said to be far less timid than other pigs: in fact the natives reported that boars often merely grunted when they tried to scare them away. They are afraid to shoot it with their ineffective ammunition as it charges when wounded. It ranges from Batam to Banka and throughout the swamp of E. Sumatra.\n\n23. *Tragulus kanchil*, sp. A \"peleodoc\" is said to occur.\n\n24. *Tragulus javanicus perflavus*, Miller. This new species is a strongly marked form having very bright pelage and a pure orange neck entirely free from black shading. I have it also from Pulo Galang and it has been taken since on Bulang. It affords a particularly good illustration of local variation as *T. formosus*, Miller of Bintang Island, only five miles away, is exceedingly dark with a collar strongly washed with black.\n\nThus the mammal fauna of Batam is Sumatran and not Peninsular for the above definitely identified species *Mus concolor* and *Cynopterus montanoi* alone are from the Peninsula only. On the other hand, *Mus lingensis*, *M. firmus* and *Sus oi* are known from the Sumatra and the Rio-Lingga Archipelago only. *Arctogalidia simplex*, *Sus rhionis* and *Tragulus perflavus* are found elsewhere only in the Archipelago while *Tupaia ferruginea balamana* and *Mus batamanus* are so far known from Batam alone.\n\nI am inclined to think that Batam, Bulang, Rempang and Galang form a small group which faunistically is more nearly related to the islands to the westward than to Bintang.\non the east, though Pulo Sauh forms a stepping stone to the latter which is only five miles away. Bintang, however, when it is fully investigated will prove to be by far the most interesting island of the whole archipelago. A bank of less than 20 fathoms connects all these islands with both Sumatra and the Peninsula, but the 10 fathom contour lines break them up into various groups of which that above noted is one of the largest.\n\nI have no notes of value about birds for they were scarce and of common species and I soon left off shooting them.\n\nSmall collections of reptiles and insects were made but they contained nothing remarkable.\n\nI preserved a few plants during my visits and two of them, which were new, have lately been described by Mr. H. N. Ridley, viz.\u2014Neckia Klossii and Didymocarpus battamensis. The latter is interesting since it grows at sea-level while I believe that the habitat of the Didymocarpi, in this locality at least, is at some altitude.\n\nA few notes on the inhabitants of Batam are given elsewhere in this Journal.\n\n1. J. S. B. R. A. S. No. 49.\nSome Ethnological Notes.\n\nC. Boden Kloss, F.R.A.I.\n\nIn the Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute Vol. XXXVII., Mr. F. W. Knocker in the course of some notes on the aborigines of Sungei Ujong\u2014the Orang Belanas\u2014relates that they tell in respect of the Sakais, how \"the parents plant a parang in the fore-arm of the young, both male and female, projecting a few inches beyond the elbow. The flesh grows round it and it eventually become part of the fore-limb. In after life this limb weapon is used to clear the jungle and not for hostile purposes.\"\n\nI am able to go one better than this. When living in Johore, it was my practice when travelling in the jungle to endeavour to ascertain whether there were current any traditions of the existence of the orang utan (*Simia satyrus*) in that part of the peninsula. The native name for this great ape is \"mawas.\" In the swampy country south of Gunong Pulai I found that the name was known and the people of the locality told me tales of its possessor. The information was interesting but not quite what I then wanted. The *Orang Mawas* were a kind of devil-men who lived in the swamps where their foot-prints might sometimes be seen. Their feet were turned backwards and, with sharp parangs which grew from their elbows like spurs, they killed any human beings they met and afterwards devoured the bodies.\n\nNothing discouraged I continued my enquiries elsewhere and learned that the Jakuns of the Endau Sembrong were also acquainted with a strange beast that seemed to be of the kind I was after. This was a huge red hairy man who lived in the trees and was called *tuhu*. I felt I was on the right track at last, but unfortunately the story went on to the effect that the *tuhu* spoke Chinese to a Chinaman when it met him in the jungle, Malay to a Malay, and the Jakun dialect to a Jakun!\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 50, 1908.\nThe head-men of the Belanas are given as 1, Batin; 2, Jinang; 3, Jukrah\u2014the usual titles among the southern inland tribes. I find that a variant of the latter also occurs among the Proto-Malays of the Kallang estuary in Singapore, a fact which Messrs. Skeat and Ridley failed to elect during their short visit thither (J. S. B. R. A. S. No. 33).\n\nThese enquirers state that the head-men of the Kampong they visited were 1, Jinang; 2, Batin. I further find in the neighbourhood one Kampong administered by 1, Batin; 2, Dukrah; and another under 1, Penghulu; 2, Jinang. At Telok Senimba, Pulo Batam, a dozen miles away, the people who are a branch of the \u201cOrang Sabimba\u201d referred to by Logan (Journal of the India Archipelago Vol. I.) have 1, Penghulu; 2, Batin.\n\nThe communities of the Kallang River have evidently been drawn from various sources and some guidance may be afforded by these titles as to their derivation.\n\nAmongst these primitive tribes the title of Batin extends throughout their range from the farthest north of Biliton, and in the islands appears to be the only one except where they have come under the influence of the ruling Malays, in which cases a Malay has often been appointed as Penghulu.\n\nIn the Peninsula however there are amongst themselves officials subordinate to the Batin known as Jinang and Jukrah. Where (according to Logan and others) a Malay has been appointed to supervise them he also is called, possibly because of his functions, Jinang, and it is needless to say that in these cases the title would occasionally become the superior one. This might account for the reversed \u201cTable of Precedency\u201d noted by Messrs. Ridley and Skeat, as Kampong Roko is a small village hedged in by dominant Malays. The anomaly of Penghulu and Jinang noticed by myself in another Kampong I can only account for by supposing that long ago the title of Batin dropped out of use.\n\nThe word bidoh, boat (also the name of a stream in Singapore) given as a Non-Malay expression, is in common use amongst the Malays of the west coast of Borneo.\nSOME ETHNOLOGICAL NOTES.\n\nMesar\u00e9. Skeat and Ridley suggest that \"the Sea-gypaies of Singapore owe their origin largely from 'Sakai' hill-tribes of the Rio-Lingga Archipelago\" and class the Belandas as \"Sakai\" also: surely this is a slip and should be Jakun or Proto-Malayan or some other equivalent of these!\n\nIt is regrettable that all those English writers who have dealt so interestingly with the primitive people should be restricted in experience to the Peninsula for the Jakuns are only the mainland representatives\u2014and probably least pure\u2014of that large family that is spread throughout a great part of Eastern Sumatra and the islands adjacent. Such, for instance, are the Orang Akit of Bengkalis and Rupat Islands, the Palong of the upper tributaries of the Siak River, the Mantong and many others of the Rio-Lingga Archipelago, the Orang Gunong of Banka and the Sika of Biliton. The Kubus and Lubus of the interior of Sumatra also appear to be members of the same family.\n\nTo Journal 41 of the Society Dr. W. L. Abbott contributes a note on \"Human Images among the Orang Man-long.\"\n\nAccording to an old inhabitant of a Kampong at Tanjong Ru, an Oorang Laut by descent\u2014though he would never admit himself to be other than a pure Orang Malayu\u2014these images are called \"Tukar Ganti\" and, in common with the \"Kapal Hantu\" and \"Rumah Sakit,\" are constructed, to his knowledge, by all the inhabitants of the Rhio Archipelago and of the creeks round Singapore in times of sickness. When the Tukar Ganti is completed the \"penyakit\" (sickness) is induced to enter it and it is then taken away to the jungle or some distant spot and there left. Further, all these objects\u2014and this was unknown to me and perhaps is so to others\u2014are used for prophylaxis as well as cure. A current instance was related.\n\n\"Ten days ago the village pawang came to the people, 'I see the evil spirits,' said he, 'the hantus are gathering thickly to afflict the Kampong. Now if we want to escape their machinations every house must contribute 40 cents so that a large vessel may be built into which the hantus will\n\nR. A. Soc. No. 50, 1908.\nenter and can then be sent away to sea.' On the day it is sent off the pawang's house will be under a pantang (tabu) to Europeans and all strangers.\"\n\nMy acquaintance also said that once these objects pass from the charge of their makers their superstitious attributes end and no one who takes possession of them is affected in any way. He observed that Europeans called his people idiots for practising such ceremonies. \"But,\" I asked, \"what does the Imam say?\" \"Oh he laughs at us or is angry and says that we are idiots too, for such hantus don't exist and such practices are not compatible with Islamism. But our pawang tells us otherwise and as it is a thing we have always done we shall continue to do so.\"\n\nMention has been made of the Orang Senimba (Sambimba). They are the people of whom Logan (Jour. Ind. Arch. Vol. I. p. 295) records that a portion were transferred from Batam Island to Johore and settled on the Tebrau River. In Johore all trace of them as a distinct tribe has now disappeared and the names seems forgotten also. Such also I found to be the case with the Biduanda Kallang settled once on the Pulai River. Nevertheless, all the creeks of the Old Straits and of the Johore River estuary are occupied by people who, although now Islamised, are still primitive in habits and appearance and quite distinct from the dominant Orang Malayu by whom they have been absorbed.\n\nThese are the people once known as Orang Seletar (J. I. A. Vol. I.) and they, with all the above, belong to the Sea-Jakun, or Orang Laut, branch of the Proto-Malays. Except for a small party on the Sungei Masai, merely brought down by a Chinaman to cut fire-wood, I could ascertain no traces of the inland division south of a line drawn between the Batu Pahat and Sedili Rivers. In this latitude they are to be found on the Lenggiu and Sayong streams, the head waters of the Johore. In this connection the cropping up of the parong legend given above is interesting as it shows that the state of affairs was other in the past.\n\nThe remaining Orang Senimba live on the shores of Senimba Bay, behind Pulo Sambu\u2014though Logan speaks of\nthem as essentially a forest people\u2014and do a little fishing, cultivating and fire-wood cutting. They are now Mohammedans which is to say that they have lost all ethnographical individuality.\n\nBut in the interior of Batam still exist an almost unspoilt people who, although the island is so small and they are nomadic, never come down to the sea. These are evidently Logan's \"Orang Muka Kuning\" (for his other tribe the Treng-Bubong\" appear to have shared the fate of the Sabimba) although the name seems unknown to the shore people. I have not seen them personally, for living in temporary shelters and wandering about, they are not easily met with during a short visit but it was stated that they are less than a hundred in number. They trade a little jungle produce occasionally and wear bark chawats when they possess no cotton garments.\n\nThe most interesting fact in connection with them is that they still use the sumpitan and ipoh poison. They do not themselves manufacture the weapon but use one of a Borneo pattern obtained by trading. My informants assured me that though the poisoned darts were effective against wild animals yet they would never kill a fowl.\n\nA similar tribe occupies the interior of Pulo Galang where a Belgian Planting Company has recently had some communication with them.\n\nAs these are probably the only island tribes who have maintained practically uncorrupted their paganism and their isolation, speedy investigation is most desirable.\nThe White-Handed Gibbon.\n\nSo far as I am aware the white-handed gibbon (*Hylobates lar*) has been regarded as an animal restricted in range to the mainland of Asia, inhabiting there the Tenasserim Province and the Malay Peninsula only. I therefore wish to place on record its occurrence in the swampy regions of East Sumatra, where it has been met with in large numbers by Dr. W. L. Abbott and myself, particularly in the Siak and Indragiri districts.\n\nIt occurs there, as elsewhere, in the biscuit-coloured, in brown and in sooty pelage, and as far as my observations are worth anything it is impossible to consider these varieties as colour races in any way. I have several times noted, though this does not seem to be general, dark females with pale infants and vice versa and have also shot pie-bald adults with the colours so distributed that it would be impossible to say whether they are dark-furred individuals becoming pale or pale becoming dark. As however the pale form is comparatively scarce it is to be inferred that the latter metamorphosis is what is happening and that the light specimens are born so.\n\nThe statement that gibbons are monogamous is one that I thoroughly agree with: whether however they divorce each other and take new partners from time to time we have yet to learn. The point is interesting since such an able reasoner as Westermarck (The Origin of Human Marriage) has come to the conclusion that the marriages of mankind are an inheritance from some ape-like progenitor.\n\nI do not ever remember meeting Malayan gibbons in parties of more than five at a time, but the most usual numbers are four or less. A small district may often contain a large number of apes but the little groups seem to live quite independently of each other and do not combine. These parties consist of two parents and their off-spring of different\nbirths, but as a rule it seems that about the time the third infant appears the eldest is sufficiently adult to take a partner with whom it starts life on its own account.\n\nIt is thus rather interesting to note that while the lower monkeys of nearly all species go about in bands\u2014*Presbytes obscurus* is inclined to pair, however\u2014in the case of the man-like apes (with the exception of the chimpanzee, perhaps the most intelligent of them all; the siamang and the Indian hoolock) the social unit is the family. This is, by many authorities, held to have been the state of primitive man before he became intellectual enough to recognise the advantages derived from union.\n\nWhile their inactive habits compelled the gorilla and orang and possibly primitive man to be practically solitary as otherwise they would have exhausted their food supplies, this is not the case with the gibbon the most agile of all the apes. I hope to contribute to a forth-coming journal some notes on the relationship between the gibbon's structure and its habits.\n\nC. B.

O. Winstedt.\n\nThis tale is not to be confused with that rollicking farce Musang Berjanggut, \"The Bearded Civet-Cat;\" it is merely a beast fable of the Aesop type. The tale and language is so simple that a literal translation would be tiresome. The following is the gist of it. Some villagers moved from their kampong up to a hill rice-clearing and left behind them a hen and two chicken which they could not catch. One day hen and chicken were looking for food in the scrub, when the chicken wandered away from the hen and met a huge civet-cat. Said the civet-cat, \"How would you like me for a step-father, you fatherless little chicks? Tell me where your mother roosts to-night and I will come and woo her.\" \"We all sleep at the end of the threshold to-night,\" chirped the chicken. \"All right I'll come and meet your mother,\" said civet-cat. So the chicken went back to the hen and the elder chicken chirped all about their meeting with civet-cat and how civet-cat was coming to visit them at 'the end of the threshold' that very night. \"Oh you very naughty tell-tale chicken\" clacked the hen and removed with them to a cross-beam under the roof. And civet prowled in vain that night all round the threshold. The next morning civet-cat met the chicken again and scolded them for their deceit. \"All mother's fault\" chirped the chicken, \"she was angry with us for telling you her roosting-place and moved to the roof beam.\" \"Oh,\" said civet-cat, \"well, where does your mother roost to-night; I am longing to meet her.\" \"On the cross-beam under the roof\" chirped the chicken. When they returned to their mother, she asked where they had been and they told the whole story. Then the hen was very angry and beat them for telling civet-cat of the roosting-place and removed and slept on the ridge-pole. In vain civet-cat searched that\nnight also. Next morning the bigger chicken said to the tiny chick, \"Come, let us go and tell civet-cat all about it or he'll be angry with us just because of mother's whims.\" So they set off and found civet-cat furious but appeased him by protesting their innocence and telling him of their new roosting-place on the roof-tree; and they vowed not to tell their whimsical mother that they had met him or had told him of her roosting-place. Then that night civet-cat crept up on the roof-tree and devoured the poor hen and her silly chicken.\n\nCh\u00e9rita Pa Musang.\n\nSa-b\u00ebrmula, maka konon ada-lah orang p\u00ebladang tiga b\u00ebranak b\u00ebrpindah dari kampong-nya diam di-ladang, habis-lah di-bawa-nya d\u00ebngan ayam \u00ectek-nya s\u00ebmua sa-kali; t\u00ebrtinggal-lah tiga ekur \u00f1am-nya sa-ekur ibu-nya dua ekur anak-nya baharu sa-b\u00ebsar t\u00ebkukur b\u00ebtina tiada-lah dapat ditangkap oleh p\u00ebladang itu karna t\u00ebrlalu amat liar-nya.

Straits Branch.\nSindbad's Old Man of The Sea.\n\nBy W. GEORGE MAXWELL.\n\nIt was in the fifth voyage of Sindbad the Sailor, after the shipwreck caused by the bereaved and vengeful roc, that he found himself upon an island where he met \"an old man, \"a comely person, who was clad from the waist downwards \"with a covering made of the leaves of trees.\" The old man was sitting by the side of the stream sighing; and in answer to Sindbad's questions made signs, by dumb show, that he wished to be carried across the stream to some fruit trees on the further side. Sindbad, in pity, took him up on his shoulders, whereupon the old man twisted his legs \"which were like the hide of a buffaloe in blackness and roughness\" round Sindbad's neck. \"I was frightened at him,\" \"Sind-\n\"bad's narrative continues \"and desired to throw him down \"from my shoulders; but he pressed upon my neck with his \"feet, and squeezed my throat, so that the world became black \"before my face, and I was unconscious of my existence, fall-\n\"ing upon the ground in a fit like one dead. He then raised \"his legs, and beat me upon my back and my shoulders and \"I suffered violent pain; wherefore I rose with him. He still \"kept his seat upon my shoulders, and I had become fatigued \"with bearing him; and he made a sign to me that I should \"go in among the trees, to the best of the fruits. When I \"disobeyed him, he inflicted upon me, with his feet, blows \"more violent than those of whips; and he ceased not to direct \"me with his hands to every place to which he desired to go, \"and to that place I went with him. If I loitered, or went \"leisurely, he beat me; and I was as a captive to him. We \"went into the midst of the island, among the trees, and he \"descended not from my shoulders by night nor by day; when \"he desired to sleep, he would wind his legs round my neck, \"and sleep a little, and then he would arise and beat me,\n\nR.

Soc., No. 50, 1908.\n\"whereupon I would arise with him quickly, unable to disobey\n\"him, by reason of the severity of that which I suffered from\n\"him.\"* It will be remembered that eventually, after many\ndays of beatings and ill treatment, Sindbad got rid of the old\nman by making him intoxicated with fermented grape juice,\nand then beating out his brains with a stone.\n\nAfter his escape Sindbad wandered for some days upon\nthe island until he met some merchants who, when they had\nheard his story, told him who it was that he encountered.\n\"This man\" they told him \"who rode upon thy shoulders is\ncalled the Old Man of the Sea, and no one ever was beneath\nhis limbs and escaped from him excepting thee.\"\n\nThe whole of Sindbad's personal narrative points to his\nadventure having been with an orang utan (simia satyrus):\nthe difficulty, the only difficulty, but the whole difficulty, is\nthe name ascribed to his persecutor by the people whom he\nmet after his escape. Hole, in his commentary, suggested\nthat the \"Old Man\" was an orang utan, but the qualifying\nwords \"of the Sea\" so baffled him that he was prepared to\nconsider them a mistake. \"I would willingly suppose\" he\nwrote, \"the phrase 'of the sea' to be an addition of the trans-\nlator, not countenanced by the original: or that it was\napplied to Es-Sindbad's persecutor merely on account of his\ninsular abode, or usual appearance by the sea side. If\neither of these conjectures be allowed we may pronounce\nhim, without any hesitation to be an orang outan.\" Hole\nthen goes on to give his reasons for his opinion.\n\nLane agreed with Hole that the \"Old Man\" was an\norang utan, and supported the theory that the words \"of the\nsea\" merely denoted the insular abode.\n\nBurton scoffed at the idea: \"the inevitable orang-utan\"\nwas his jeering comment. But his own suggestion does not\nseem worthy of much support. The story is, he says \"a\njocose exaggeration of a custom prevailing in parts of Asia\nand especially in the African interior where the tsetse fly\nprevents the breeding of burden-beasts . . . . . In\n\n* Lane's translation.\n\nJour. Straits Branch.\n\"Central Africa the kinglet rides on a slave, and on cere-\nmonious occasion mounts his Prime Minister.\" The weak-\nness of the connection of ideas is however apparent. The\ncustom of one man being carried by another does not convey\nthe impression of the unnatural, clinging, unshakeable,\ncreature with which Sindbad was saddled. For an ex-\nplanation of the expression \"of the Sea,\" Burton had\nrecourse to the classics. \"The classicists,\" he wrote \"of\ncourse, find the Shaykh of the Sea in the Tritons and\nNereus, and Bochart (Hieroi i 858, 880) notices the home\naquaticus, Senex Judaeus and Senex Marinus.\"\n\nBut he has made no attempt to show any connection of\nideas between the Man-riding Man and the Water-Man. The\nfive arguments which Hole adduces in favour of the orang\nutan theory may be briefly enumerated as follows:\n\n1. The old man never speaks, but expresses his wishes\nby signs.\n\n2. He apparently lives solely on fruit.\n\n3. Though his face is like that of a human being, the\nhide of his legs is like that of an animal.\n\n4. The \"pressing,\" the \"squeezing,\" the \"winding\" of\nthe legs.\u2014[Any one who has kept a pet orang utan, wali-\nwah (Hylobates lar) or siamang (H. syndactylus) as a pet\nknows the almost wild despair with which it clings to its\nmaster, as if it would suffer itself to be torn to pieces rather\nthan be removed.]\n\n5. The well known partiality of apes and monkeys to\nintoxicants, and the extreme quickness with which they be-\ncome intoxicated.\n\nA sixth point, which was probably unknown to Hole, but\nto which considerable weight may be attached is that stories\nsimilar to Sindbad's story are told to his day of the orang\nutan by the Dyaks. Hugh Clifford's \"Story of Chaling, the\nDyak\" is very like the adventure of Sindbad. Chaling, it\nwill be remembered, was carried off by a female orang utan to\nits platform on a forest tree, and for many days was unable to\neffect his escape.\n\nR. A. Soc. No. 50, 1908.\nThe principal objection to the orang utan theory is that Simia satyrus is red, and not black. But in explanation of this I would suggest that there has been some confusion between Simia satyrus, which is red, and hylobates lar which is black. *At the risk being considered fanciful, I am even prepared to suggest that the white beard, with which some old versions of the Arabian Story and the modern illustrator to Lane\u2019s translation have adorned the \u201cOld Man\u201d are an embellishment of the white ruff of Hylobates lar. A minor objection is the fact that grapes do not grow in the countries where the orang utan is found. Toddy, however, and other similar intoxicants are well known; and it is not improbable that the words \u201cgrape juice\u201d were inserted by some copyist.\n\nLet us take it that Sindbad\u2019s persecutor was an orang utan. How do we get from orang utan to \u201cMan of the Sea\u201d? Simply, I think; through the Malay. \u201cMan of the Sea\u201d (orang laut) is a mistake for \u201cMan of the Forest\u201d (orang utan).\n\nIt is well known that orang utan has two meanings: it is the name for the ape, and is also the generic name for the aborigines. They are known as orang utan; orang bukit, (men of the hills); or, in the case of the tribes driven inland, orang dalam (men of the interior), or orang darat (men of the land); whilst in contradistinction to the latter, the tribes driven to the coast are known as orang laut (men of the sea).\n\nThus the Sakei are divided into Sakei laut and Sakei darat, in the same way that Dyaks are divided into Sea-Dyaks and Land-Dyaks.\n\n* In the account of Sindbad\u2019s adventure in his third voyage, in the Island of Apes, Lane\u2019s translation describes the apes as being \u201ccovered with hair like black felt,\u201d while in the Calcutta edition and Langl\u00e8s\u2019 edition they are described as \u201cred downy creatures.\u201d I suggest that the mariner who described the animals as red was thinking of the orang utan, and that the other who described them as black was thinking of the wah-wah. A similar confusion seems to have been made in the case of the \u201cOld Man.\u201d\n\nJeur. Straits Branch.\nOLD MAN OF THE SEA.\n\nIt is easily therefore to make a mistake between a \"man of the sea\" and a \"man of the forest,\" for both are of the same stock; and it is equally easy to make a mistake between the aboriginal and the ape, for both are known by the same name. And this is the mistake that I think has been made. The position may be briefly put thus:\u2014what the merchant said to Sindbad was \"you've met an orang utan;\" what Sindbad has recorded is \"you've met orang laut.\"\n\nIf this is conceded, it would appear that Borneo is the island of the adventure with the \"Old Man,\" (Lane suggested Sumatra, where the orang utan is also found) and that Sindbad's tale and Hugh Clifford's tale are but slightly different versions of the story (founded perhaps on fact) which is told by the Dyaks regarding the gigantic ape that, to this day, is the most typical inhabitant of their forests.\n\nPostscript. I have, since this note was set up in type, come across a mistake which is exactly similar but even more extraordinary. On page 175 of Volume II. of \"Asiatick Researches\" will be found a curious confusion between the Thibetan Yak and the manat\u00e9 or dugong. Two more dissimilar animals could hardly be imagined; but one is the \"Mountain-Cow\" and the other is the \"Sea-Cow;\" and \"Mountain-Cow\" and \"Sea-Cow\" have been confused in exactly the same way that \"Forest-Man\" and \"Sea-Man\" have (I suggest) been confused.\n\nW. G. M.\nSpada.\n\nOne of the first words that a visitor to Java or Sumatra hears is \"spada.\" It is, in the hotels of the Dutch Colonies, the common call for a servant; a person shouts \"spada\" in the same way that in this Colony he shouts \"boy\" and in the same curious way the servant, wherever he may be, shouts back \"tuan.\" The word is not a native one, and is not used by the natives.\n\nThe derivation usually given of the word is a corruption of two Malay words \"siapa ada\" (is anyone there?).\n\nI do not know however whether any one has suggested that the word dates from, and is a survival of, the days of British rule in the island now under the Dutch flag. Such however is probably the case. The use in the Bengal Presidency of the call \"koi hai\" (is anyone there?) is so well known that a civil servant of that Presidency is generally known as \"Qui-hai.\"* I suggest that \"siapa ada\" is merely the translation of \"koi hai\" and that it was introduced by the servants of the Honourable East India Company who had served in Calcutta before they came further east. \"Siapa ada\" certainly is not idiomatic Malay, and would not ordinarily be used by Malays in the sense in which, in this case, \"spada\" is.\n\nProbably it is this very fact, quite as much as the open vowel sounds of the syllables, that have led to its present corrupted and contracted form.\n\nIf my suggestion is correct, two curious facts are worthy of note: first, that in India it is the caller and in the Netherlands Indies it is the person called that is known (in each case\n\n---\n\n* It has even passed into the French language.\n\nIn the \"Correspondance avec sa famille\" of Victor Jacquemont there is the following passage (Vol.: II. page 308):\n\n\"J'ai vu dans vos gazettes de Calcutta les clameurs de quoi hace (sobiguet des Europ\u00e9ens Bengalis de ce cote) sur la chaleur.\"\n\nJour. Straits Branch, R. A. Soc., No. 50, 1906.\nby the alien nation) by the words of the call; and second, that\nthe call survives only in a country that has ceased to be under\nBritish rule, and does not survive (if indeed it ever was\nknown) in the Colony of the Straits Settlements.\n\nW.

On splitting it up three or four bats flew out but there being more inside he brought it to me tied up. On taking it to the museum and carefully opening it Dr. Hanitsch and I found no less than twenty-three bats of which four were adult females and nineteen were young ones. One of these was still clinging to the mother and sucking. The joint of bamboo in which these bats were enclosed was a foot in length and the diameter of the hollow inside was 2 inches. The septa at each node were perfect and unbroken, and the only possible entrance was made by a crack on one side which allowed of a narrow slip to be pushed outwards so that a triangular aperture a quarter of an inch across in its widest part appeared in the upper septum.\n\nThrough this very small space all these bats must have crept. The inside of the bamboo was wet and dark coloured and there were some dipterous larvae within.\n\nIn another clump of the same kind of bamboo, two other joints containing young bats of apparently the same kinds were opened. In one joint when opened, it having been felled and left for some days in the sun all the bats were dead and decomposed. They nearly filled the joint and were apparently about thirty in number. In the other several bats had escaped but there were a number of young ones and one half grown. Specimens of these bats were sent to the British Museum where Mr. Oldfield Thomas examined them and found them to be *Tylonycteris pachyptus*, (*Vesperugo pachyptus* Dobson). He writes, \"This bat has an exceedingly flattened skull and thus many account for its ability to get\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 50, 1908.\nthrough a crack only a quarter of an inch wide. I never heard of specimens found in such a place before.\"\n\nH. N. Ridley.\n\nTour. Straits Branch.\nThe Labiates of the Malay Peninsula.\n\nBy H. N. Ridley.\n\nThe Labiatae in the Materials for a Flora of the Malay peninsula have been described by Dr. Prain who gives eighteen genera and thirty species of this order as occurring in the Malay peninsula. Like the Compositae the Labiates are very poorly represented all through the rain forest region. They are inhabitants of open country and being all small plants and being dispersed chiefly by the mere sprinkling of their seeds as the wind blows, can neither push their way into our dense forests nor establish themselves there in the thick shade if they did get there. The only forest species indeed that we possess, the Gomphostemmas, have been so far modified for forest life that their fruits are developed into small white pulpy drupes, which can be eaten by birds and so the seeds dispersed. An analogous case among the Rubiaceae with capsular fruit is seen here too in *Hedyotis congesta* belonging to an open country group of capsular seeded weeds in which also the fruit is developed into a small white pulpy berry.\n\nThe species recorded in the Materials are as follows:\n\n* Ocimum sanctum*, L. *O. Basilicum*, L. *O. gratissimum*, L. (and *O. canum* might be added.) *Orthosiphon stamineus*, Benth. *Hyptis brevipes*, Poit. *H. suaveolens*, Poit. *Plectranthus Kunstleri*, Prain! *Coleus atropurpureus*, Benth! *Pogostemon Heyneanus*, Benth! *P.

G. Curtisi, Prain! Cymaria dichotoma, Benth! Acrymia ajugiflora, Prain! Those marked \u201c!\u201d are the only ones which can claim to be really indigenous.\n\nThe Basils, Ocimum, and the Mint, Mentha javanica are garden pot herbs which can hardly be said to have established themselves anywhere. The Mint quoted only from Malacca, Griffith, has long been cultivated. It seldom flowers here, and I have never seen it outside a garden plot. Salvia coccinea, Juss. and Orthosiphon stamineus as far as our region is concerned are only to be met with in flower beds. The Orthosiphon \u201cKumis Kuching\u201d of the Malays is however a native of Siam and may be found wild across our borders in the extreme north.\n\nLeonurus nepetifolia, Br. is also a cultivated plant only to be found in gardens.\n\nAnisomeles malabarica, Br. only met with in Penang town suburbs, is obviously an introduction from India probably by Tamils. It was collected in 1822 in Penang by Wallich.\n\nLeonurus sibiricus is brought in and cultivated by Chinese who use it in medicine.\n\nSalvia plebeia, Br. is only recorded from Malacca without collector\u2019s name, probably the specimen was from an introduced plant. Leucas martinicensis, Br. is also an introduction. It has only been obtained by Scortechini in Perak.\n\nNone of these plants have ever established themselves as weeds, and can only be classed as Garden escapes.\n\nThoroughly established here as all over the tropics are the two American Hyptis, H. snaveolens and H. brevipes.\n\nThe rest of the list fall into three groups (1) herbs occurring as weeds only in cleared ground near cultivation, but certainly natives of this area. These are Coleus atropurpureus, Benth., Anisomeles ovata, Br., Lencas zeylanica, Br. and L. lavandulifolia, Sm. and Calamintha gracilis, Benth. This latter I found in some quantity at the foot of the Thaiping hills in open ground. It has otherwise only been found in Java and once in Assam.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\n(2). Herbs growing in the jungles and obviously indigenous the *Gomphostemonas*, and I believe *Pogostemon Heyneanus*, Benth., the Indian patchouli.\n\nThe *Pogostemon* is not so far as I am aware cultivated here, but it is possible that it is. I have met with it on stream banks in forests, at Rawang in Selangor (No. 7603 of my collection) and at Taka Tahan on the Tahan River (No. 2031) also in Sarawak at Lundu (No. 1238) and it is in Haviland's collection from Penkulu Ampat in Sarawak. In the Tahan River locality it was growing near *Colocasia antiquorum* at an old Sakai camping ground, and was probably carried there by the Sakais, but there was nothing to suggest it had been introduced in the other localities. It is known to the Malays as Rumput Ruku, Poko Nijao, Nilam Bukit and Chilam Bukit. It is used as a poultice in cases of headache, rheumatism and boils, and in the form of a decoction is drunk for dropsy. The flowers the colour of which is not given in the Materials are pale violet.\n\n*P. Cablin*, Benth. the commonly cultivated patchouli is described fully in the Materials. Its native home is quite unknown.\n\n*Dysophylla auricularia*, Bl. is undoubtedly wild here, I think. It grows in swampy open ground, edges of rivers, etc.\n\n*Scutellaria discolor*, Benth. was once collected by Scortechini in Perak and is probably wild. I have never seen it.\n\n(3). The third set of indigenous Labiates are all from the limestone rocks of Ipoh and nearby. They are *Plectranthus Kunstleri*, Prain., *Paraphlomis rugosa*, Prain. and *Cymaria dichotoma*, Benth., *Acrymia ajugiflora*, Prain. The occurrence of four species of this order out of so small a number of indigenous species on such a limited area as this range of limestone hills is very remarkable.\n\nThus this large order is represented in the Malay peninsula by only 15 species which can be considered to be truly indigenous.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 50, 1908.\nThe Crackling Moth.\n\nBy H. N. Ridley.\n\nIt is not unfrequent when passing along roads through woods, just after dusk has set in to hear all around a strange crackling sound not very loud but quite distinct and resembling somewhat Chinese crackers heard at a distance. This is produced by a black moth of some size, which seems to be hardly distinct from *Nyctipao hieroglyphica* as figured in Hampson's moths of India, and Moore's Lepidoptera of Ceylon. I do not find any mention of the peculiar behaviour of this insect made anywhere in these works, so I will give some account of it. The moth is three and a half inches across the wings, which are rather longshaped and scolloped along the edges, wings and body are of a deep brown black, above and below and on the upper wing near the tip is a yellow mark something like an 8 but with the loops more oblong and angled and the neck more distinct. In the centre of the upper wing is a faint shadowy eye formed of two rings of black one inside the other, the centre of a slightly paler brown colour than the rest of the wing. On the underside the yellow spot is seen but not so bright in colour, the peacock's eye is invisible and there is another small yellow spot lower down on the upper wing. The body is cylindric black, and the antennae are wiry and black. The insect differs from the figure of the Ceylon form, in Moore's Lepidoptera of Ceylon, in its darker colour and very indistinct eye, which in the Ceylon form has some chestnut red in the centre, (*Argiva hieroglyphica* Pl. 165) but it is perhaps a local form. The insect above described is a male. The females have a white spot on the upper wing.\n\nDuring the day, the moth hides under roots or in crevices of rock where it is quite dark, as do most species of the genus, and if disturbed dashes off to seek another hiding place.\nhave seen it thus in the garden rockery, and in the Bukit Timah forests. It leaves its resting spot about half past six in the evening and betakes itself to an open road or path. Here it flies briskly backwards and forwards, in the shadows, and at such a pace that owing to this and its dark colour making it so invisible, it is very difficult to capture. Often half a dozen or so are dashing about the road at a time and they keep to specially favoured spots, night after night. They do not make any noise when flying about singly, but when two are flying about chasing each other they produce the strange crackling sound described above. Owing to the darkness it is impossible to see how they do it, neither am I sure whether it is effected by a pair or by two males only. I have only caught males. They remain till it is actually quite dark, but then seem to disappear. Neither light nor cow-droppings which are often attractive to moths engage their attention. They keep just out of the light of the road lamps. When by a lucky stroke one is secured in the net, it is usually very quiet and does not flutter about, so that often one does not notice at first that it is trapped, but so fast it flies and so hard one has to strike at it that the insect is very apt to be damaged by the concussion.\n\nIt appears at the end of May. This habit of dashing about the roads and its peculiar crackling noise, are not shared with any other Nyctipaos as far as I know.\n\nA larger species with brown wings ornamented with white eyes, is one of our commonest moths and often comes to light. It rests during the day under rocks or banks, or on beams in sheds or houses and though rapid in flight when disturbed, merely dashes from one hiding place to another, and I have never met with it dashing about the road at night in the way that N. hieroglyphica does. The latter is abundant in Singapore and I have also met with it in Pahang and other parts of the peninsula.\n\nNothing appears to be known of the life history of this moth.\n\nH. N. RIDLEY.\n\nJour. Straits Branch.\nNew or Rare Malayan Plants.\n\nSeries IV.\n\nBy H. N. Ridley.\n\nIt will be seen by this series of novelties that the knowledge of our flora even of the best known spots is not yet complete. Even in Singapore with its nearly exterminated native flora, still some novelties lurk in the few remaining bits of forest, thus the Stagnount wood produced the beautiful new ginger which was found growing in a spot which I have frequently visited and only a few yards from my usual track. The Randia, the Heritiera and Diospyros described herein I have known for many years, but they have not been described in the Materials and so are now published for the first time.\n\nThe well known furniture wood Katinga from the Siamese borders has long been prized and I obtained leaves and a fruit some years ago from Mr. F. G. Penney, who had a fine collection of furniture made from its wood. A number of young plants were raised in the Botanic Gardens, and I lately obtained specimens shewing parts of the flower from Mr. H. C. Robinson. It proves to be a Murraya allied to the well known Kamuning wood, so much valued for the handles and sheaths of Krises.\n\nThe low-lying forest region of Southern Johore, has produced several interesting novelties, including a remarkable new genus of gingers, but many more curious and interesting plants will be found in this unexplored district when time serves to investigate it. From Sarawak Mr. Hewitt still continues to send many more novelties, and among Sarawak plants I am glad to be able to associate the name of the\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 50, 1908.\nFounder of our Society with the beautiful climber, *Hosea Lobbiana*, the ladder to the moon, (Tanga Bulan) of the Malays. This charming plant abundant in the swamps near Kuching, has been more or less known for a long time. Thomas Lobb while collecting plants for cultivation for Veitch found it and dried a spray of it which is now at Kew, but Lobb does not seem to have troubled to put localities on the tickets of his dried specimens, and when his collections were received at Kew, many were wrongly localised, and this plant was supposed to have come from Penang, and was described as thence by Clarke in the Flora of British India as *Clerodendron Lobbiana*, (the peculiar fruit however prevents it from being a Clerodendron).\n\nMiss North saw it at Kuching and made a drawing of it, which however was not recognized as Lobb's plant. Bishop Hose brought plants of it into his garden at Kuching, and some years ago gave one to the Botanic Gardens in Singapore where it has been cultivated. It seems of slow growth and not very easy to propagate, so that it has not been found possible as yet to distribute it to other gardens. It is a most attractive plant with its red upper leaves and salmon-orange flowers.

The finest is a conspicuous object by the plant sheds growing close to a still taller *Palaquium bancanum*. The underside of the leaves is covered with a layer of coppery silvery scales circular in outline with numerous irregular teeth on the margin. These scales also occur on the upper surface of the young leaves. The Male flowers are produced in great abundance rosy pink in color. The females seem much scarcer. I have failed to find any on my specimens. The fruit has a much more distinct wing than has *H. littoralis* the common sea shore tree, but it is not sufficiently large to act in dispersing the plant.

This handsome wood is of light yellow color, ornamented with dark brown streaks and strains, fairly hard in texture and taking a good polish. Mr. F. Penney obtained a considerable quantity of the wood from Siamese territory North of Province Wellesley, from which he had made furniture, boxes, etc., which was very highly valued on account of its beauty. He obtained also leaves and fruit of the tree. For the flowers I am indebted to Mr. H. C. Robinson, who met with it in Upper Perak.\n\nIt differs from other species of the genus in the greater size of the leaves, the conspicuously stalked ovary, and the remarkable fruit which resembles a citron. The rind has a bitter terpentiney flavour, and the comparatively scanty pulp is quite tasteless. The fruit is so entirely different from that of any other species of the genus that the plant might almost be separated generically.\n\n**Melastomaceae.**\n\n*Osbeckia chinensis*, L.\n\nHas been sent by Mr. Fox from Setul in Southern Siam where it was collected by Mohammed Aniff, the\n\nJour.

The typical plant is a large stout shrub or small tree common in the open country with flesh colored flowers in dense racemes. The variety *pauciflora* is a tall slender little-branched shrub, with a slender broken up raceme of white or creamy white sweet-scented flowers. It only occurs in dense wet forest and is not found with the common species. Thus the variety occurs in Bukit Timah forest, while *F. racemosa* does not occur at all in Singapore.\n\n*F. Ridleyi*, King and Gamble.\n\nThis is not completely described as the authors had not seen flowers of it. It appears only to have been collected by myself once on the lower slopes of Mount Ophir and also on Bukit Timah in Singapore. The only plant I found in Singapore was growing as an epiphyte on a dead tree at the top of the hill. The tree later fell down and I believe the plant quite perished. Before it did so however, I managed to obtain a cutting and planted it in the Botanic Gardens where it has now developed into\n\nJour. Straits Branch.\na large branching shrub about 12 or 14 feet tall. It first flowered in 1902, and set fruit. The leaves are dark green shining above, glaucous beneath, obovate with prominent nerves beneath, on the upper surface are scattered roundish elevations, corresponding to glands of a yellowish color beneath. The buds are protected by a white resinous secretion which become, buff yellow when exposed to the air. The flowers are in cymes of four, on short peduncles. Calyx lobes ovate blunt nearly an inch long. Corolla tube thick nearly 2 inches long pale orange green, the lobes oblong obtuse emarginate reflexed, white shaded with green 1 inch long \u00bd inch wide. Stamens long white, anthers oblong rounded pale violet. Style rather thick greenish. Stigma capitate emerald green conic about 3 inches long, ending in the stout style.\n\nF. auriculata, Jack.\n\nThis the finest of all the Fagraeas, usually at least starts life as an epiphyte and killing its host becomes a very large branching shrub sometimes as much as 30 feet tall. The branches are straggling and flexuous, and armed with short sharp points on either side of the auricles of the leaves. Most of the descriptions of this plant as taken from herbarium specimens much under-rate the size of the leaves and flowers. There seem to be two forms however in one of which the flowers are much smaller than in the other and commoner forms.\n\nThe flowers during life have the following dimensions. Calyx 3 inches long and 2 inches in diameter. Corolla tube 6 inches long and 3 inches across the mouth, lobes 3 inches across, and \u00bc inch thick. The whole corolla is eight to 12 inches or more across. The stamens are three inches long, the style four inches with an emerald green stigma more than half an inch across.\n\nThe flower opens in the early morning and remains open for two days before falling, or turning yellow. It exhales a coarse rather musky scent. The stamens have\ntheir anthers at first up-curved, but ere long they fall and lie on the lower face of the tube. The stigma is then not fully developed and not half as big as it eventually becomes. The stamens dihisce, and produce a quantity of white pollen when they are in a prone position. The flowers are now visited by the very small Trigona (Tr ruficornis). These hover about the stamens, then settle and gather pollen, rise hover again and resettle. Occasionally they rest on the stigma, and deposit pollen thereon. Usually however the stigma is not developed till the next day, when the pollen is all gone, and if there has been rain, wet and spoilt, for it has no protection. On the second day, the stigma is fully developed, and has attained its full size. I have seen no other insect at the flower, though I watched for hawkmoths for a long time in the evening, none visited it.\n\nThe fruit is six inches long surrounded at the base by the thick green overlapping calyx lobes. These are ellipsoid rounded at the top and elevated in the centre, 3 inches long by 2 inches wide. The fruit is cone-shaped with a blunt top, polished lead-colour. When ripe it dehisces at the top into five lobes, covered with a sweet orange pulp in which the seeds are imbedded. This pulp is evidently derived from the placenta. The fruit often splitting and leaving the placenta erect in the centre and covered with the small seeds imbedded in the pulp. The pulp is sweetish with a strong unpleasant bitter taste and is very attractive to birds and ants. The seeds are irregularly angled, and finely reticulate. The seeds when deposited on a tree trunk germinate and the little plants as they grow emit long olive yellow roots like those of an orchid, which run upwards and downwards on the tree trunk, for a length of 6 or 8 feet or more. The plant branches from the base sending out 2 or more stems. Eventually it appears either to kill the tree or descend to the ground forming a tree of some size. The largest plant in the gardens has layered itself from one of the branches.\n\nJour.

I would add the following notes to the description. It is an epiphyte with rather flaccid leaves for a Fagraea. The flowers are borne in pairs on axillary peduncles at the ends of the branches. The peduncles are an inch long and rather stout, as are the pedicels \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) inch long. The calyx lobes are ovate blunt \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) inch long.

The calyx lobes are short and ovate. The corolla tube \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) inch long, trumpet shaped, the lobes oblong obtuse reflexed, as long as the tube.

In the Botanic Gardens it comes up everywhere in the grass plots where the seeds has been carried by bats or birds, or as I have seen by the fruit-eating ants.\n\nSpecimens have been distributed from the Botanic Gardens herbaria under Gardens (Ridley 5817); Pahang: Pekan (1028); Penang: Telok Bahang (Curtis 314); Malacca: Merlimau (Derry 53). I have also met it wild in the Dindings and Province Wellesley.\n\n*F. speciosa*, Bl., is a very different looking tree, which attains a height of 100 feet and a diameter of 3-4 feet. The bark is curious, being channelled in long straight grooves, much less rough than in *F. fragrans*. The leaves are lanceolate gradually narrowed to the petiole and long acuminate, polished light green and conspicuously undulate even when dry, nerves five pairs. The cymes are more lax than in *F. fragrans*. The flowers orange yellow, and rather smaller. The calyx lobes more lanceolate, obtuse. Nerves 5 pairs. The corolla tube \u00bc inch long but nearly cylindric, and the lobes lanceolate obtuse much narrower and shorter than the tube. The filaments are twice as long as the corolla lobes. The style is long and yellowish with a capitate stigma. The berry is oblong in outline and always yellow.\n\nThis tree is an inhabitant of the dense forests, though there are a few in what is now open country in Singapore, at Tanglin, they are merely the survivors of an old long destroyed forest. The tree is known, as Tembusu paya, Tembusu Bukit, and Tembusu Tembaga and is valued for its timber which is of much greater size than that of *F. fragrans*.

Its appearance certainly suggested that its affinities lay with the Neottieae section among which saprophytes are not at all uncommon. But in the plants obtained in Bukit Sadanen in Malacca, I found what appeared to be a distinct disc to the pollen masses and the anther is not at all like that of most\n\nJour. Straits Branch.\nNeottieae. I have recently (April 17, 1907) rediscovered the plant in Singapore, in dense forests by the side of a stream at a spot formerly known as Stagmount, and have thus had an opportunity of examining the plant again. The Singapore plant differs from the ones found in Malacca in having the lip nearly quadrate with a central tooth and hardly distinctly bilobed, the limb white and only the claw violet. The rostellum very small in the Malacca plant seems quite absent and the curved sausage-shaped pale flesh-colored pollinia have no trace of any disc at all. This plant was evidently destined to be self-fertilised as the pollinia slip into the stigma with the greatest ease. The filament so long in the Malacca plant is quite short in the Singapore one. For the present it may be preferable to consider the Singapore plant as a variety, Singaporense of the species.\n\nNow in the light on the plant shown by this variety, we can more easily determine its affinity, and that is I think with the genus Gastrodia, to which it is allied in its stout rhizome, its connate perianth, (for the whole of the perianth is connate at the base, though divided into two lips, one consisting of the sepal and two petals, the other of the two lower sepals), and the form of the pollinia. Gastrodia differs in the almost completely tubular flower, and the very short stelidia.\n\nLeucolena ornata var. Singaporense.\n\nLip subquadrate with a median tooth hardly bilobed, limb white, base violet. Rostellum quite absent. Pollinia free with no disc. Filament of anther much shorter.\n\nDamp sandy woods on a stream bank at Stagmount, Singapore, flowering in April 1907.\n\nZingiberaceae.\n\nGeocharis, n. gen.\n\nCreeping herbs with rather slender rhizomes throwing up leafy stems and inflorescences at intervals. Leaves\nelliptic to lanceolate shortly petioled. Inflorescence on a tall or short peduncle covered with long green sheaths, raceme erect many flowered. Flowers orange or red very shortly pedicelled. Bracts very small spathaceous. Calyx tubular trifid, lobes caudate ciliate. Petals as long somewhat similar. Lip deeply bifid into two narrowed linear lobes base adnate to the corolla. Stamen filament broader than the anther involute forming a tube with the lip, with two short subulate staminodes at the upper angle. Anther broad oblong with an entire ovate appendage. Style stout. Stigma obtuse curved sub-bilobed. Stylobes annulate lobed.\n\nJohore, Sumatra and Borneo.\n\nThis genus though based on a plant obtained in Johore, I think must include one at least and probably both of the plants described by Schuman under the section Geocharis of Alpinia vis. A. macrostemon, Schumann of Sumatra, and probably Alpinia decurva, Ridley a New Guinea plant. I have therefore adopted Schumann's sectional names as a generic names for these plants. Schumann who included a great many and very varied plants in the genus Alpinia, noted the fact that both the above mentioned plants resembled the genus Riedelia, and it is possible that A. decurva, Ridl. may belong to that Papuan genus. I cannot see any connection with or resemblance to the plants of the genus Geostachys, as suggested by him.\n\nG. aurantiaca, n. sp.\n\nRhizome \u00bd inch thick, leafy stems about 2 feet tall swollen at the base, sheaths rugose closely brown hairy blade a foot long 4\u00bd inches wide elliptic glabrous deep green shining above, paler beneath, petiole \u00bd inch long brown hairy. Peduncle of inflorescence 1 inch long, covered with long loose deep green rugose sheaths. Raceme 5 inches long, flowers crowded very shortly stalked numerous. Bracts minute spathaceous. Calyx\n\nJour. Straits Branch.\ntubular 3 lobed, lobes caudate hairy 1\u00bd inch long, glabrous except at the cuspidate tip, orange. Corolla lobes equally long linear oblong orange. Lip as long as the anther, deeply split into two linear lobes for nearly all its length lobes obtuse crimson with a yellow edge. Anther oblong pale yellowish with a small ovate crest, filament broad, edges involute towards the lip and forming a tube with it, pinkish yellow, with two subulate points at the top near the anther. Stylodes forming a shortly 3 lobed pale violet ring. Style stout, stigma obcuneate, upper lip longer than the lower and incurved. Base of filament in the tube with a large tuft of silky hairs. Ovules numerous.\n\nJohore: In thick low swampy forest at Kukub. In bud April 1908. Borneo, Sarawak: Bidi (Hewitt Aug. 1907).\n\nThis remarkable plant seems most nearly allied to the genus *Riedelia* which is confined to the Papuasian region of the Archipelago.\n\nThe separate inflorescence and the corolla-like sepals are very remarkable points of difference, and the broad involuted filament forming a tube with the lip though free from it is very curious. I only found one plant of it in bud.\n\nThe woods in which this plant occurs are remarkable in many ways. The soil consists of nothing but dead and rotten timber and vegetable debris, for a very considerable depth, below and in other parts of the estate there is a great deal of a very greasy stiff clay. The presence of recognisable fruits of the Nipa palm show that this part of the coast was marine at no very distant period. The mangrove swamps and tidal streams seem to have receded and been covered up with a dense wet forest, containing a somewhat peculiar flora. The trees are of very large size, *Cumpasia Malaccensis* being very abundant. The absence of *Nephrodiums Lastreas* and such ferns is very striking, and indeed the\nterrestrial ferns common in the clayey woods of Singapore and the greater part of the Singapore flora is not represented, except in the matter of epiphytes. *Calanthe veratrifolia*. A very fine form with unusually grey leaves, *Lepidogyne longifolia* otherwise only known from Penara Bukit in Penang, *Cystorchis purpurascens*, *Plocoglottis javanica*, *Nephelaphyllum pulchrum* were among the terrestrial orchids. In some spots the preponderance of Monocotyledons over Dicotyledons was very marked. Thus some parts of the forests consisted of *Phrynium malaccense* and *Ph. hirtum*, *Donax grandis*, *Alpinia melanocarpa*, *Plagiostachys albiflora* n. sp., with several other Zingiberaceae not in flower. *Zalacca conferta* and *Wallichiana*; one or two species of *Daemonorops*, *Calamus pencillatus* and several species of *Pinanga*, and *Nenga Wendlandiana*, *Oncosperma tigillaria* and *Pholidocarpus Kingianus* a few tree ferns, and some large dicotyledonous trees, formed the rest of the flora. *Schismatoglottis Wallichii* often in great abundance, *Alocasia longiloba*, *Homalomena rostrata* represent the aroids.\n\nThe immense mass of vegetable debris forming the soil to a considerable depth, without any apparent mixture of mineral matter, not a pebble or fragment of stone being visible over the whole of this area, suggests that the tertiary coal deposits of Borneo and Labuan have had some such origin as this.\n\n**G. rubra**, n. sp.\n\nRhizome slender with strong rather stout roots. Stem slender 14 inches long \u00bd inch through. Leaves narrow lanceolate caudate tapering gradually at the base to a short petiole, glabrous above, pubescent on the back especially on the mid-rib 9 inches long 1\u00bd inch wide, ligule oblong rounded entire, sheaths ribbed with transverse ribs. Raceme 3-6 inches long erect from the rhizome, on a short peduncle 1-1\u00bd inch long covered with lax sheaths. Flowers red, on slender erect pedicels 1 inch long. Bracts very small ovate pubescent.

Corolla tube but little longer, lobes linear oblong obtuse slightly pubescent and hooded at the tip. Lip deeply bifid into two narrow linear blunt lobes for half its length basal portion linear with a strong median keel, free from the filament except near the base. Anther oblong curved, with the cells slightly diverging at the tip, appendage very short rounded ovate, filament below the anther for some way linear flat fleshy, then winged widely with the staminodes in the form of two short triangular subulate processes. Style and stigma about as long as to the tip of the appendage.\n\nBorneo, Sarawak: at Quop (Hewitt, March 1908). Flowers red.\n\nThis species differs from the preceding in its much smaller size, short racemes of long pedicelled flowers, and colour. The wings of the filaments, evidently the attached staminodes do not reach as high in this species as in the other, where they are adnate to the anther. The lip is not split so far down and is free for a longer distance.\n\n*Alpinia vittata*, Hort. Bull. Nicholson Gard. Dict. 54. pl. 63.\n\n*Costus Zebrinus*, Hort.\n\nStems rather slender about 6 feet tall, leafy. Leaves lanceolate acuminate glabrous narrowed at the base not petioled, fifteen inches long and three inches across, green striped longitudinally with white, ligule short entire truncate edges ciliate, pink. Raceme terminal many flowered, 3 inches long rather lax, rachis white. Bracts about seven not imbricate, elliptic rounded at the top hardly narrowed at the base, glabrous pink half an inch long and wide, shortly mucronate, with a scariosus edge.

Lip as long oblong fleshy slightly tapering to the blunt tip, concave with a median depressed line quite entire except that occasionally there is a short tooth on one side. Filament of stamen adnate below the anther to the lip and forming a tube with it. Anther cells oblong white narrow. Connective very thick fleshy ending above in an irregularly dentate thick appendage. Style shorter than connective. Stigma thick and wide with a transverse slit. Stylodes forming a complete circle with numerous vertical grooves.\n\nNew Ireland (Micholitz).\n\nThis plant has long been in cultivation for its ornamental foliage. I saw it in Ceylon Botanic Gardens in 1888, and it appears to have been introduced before that. It was named *Castus zebrinus* in Ceylon. Probably *Alpinia albolineata*, Williams Cat. 1880 is the same thing. The flowers do not appear to have ever been described nor has any proper description of the plant ever been published. It is only mentioned in Schumann's *v. Scitamineae* in the *Pflanzenreich*. It is best I think to refer it to the genus *Alpinia* though it differs from typical species of that genus in the entire lip of the same shape as the corolla lobes but more fleshy, and the prolongation of the very thick connective into a crest behind the anther, and the lip connate with the filament up to the anther.\n\n*A. grandiceps*, n. sp.\n\nA stout plant, stem over \u00bd inch through. Leaves oblong lanceolate caudate acuminate, base long acuminate into a distinct petiole, blade 30 inches long, petiole 4 inches long subterete, width of blade 3 inches finely appressed pubescent on both surfaces, petiole pubescent, ligule oblong 3 inches long hairy on the edge, sheath pubescent.

Lip rather longer cymbiform edge crisped and curled, fleshy \"veined with red brown below the throat.\" Stamen rather short, filament broad linear, anther lobes thick and fleshy unappendaged. Fruit capitulum very large, six inches through. Capsule glabrous hairy an inch long, crowned with the persistent calyx tube.\n\nSarawak: Kuching (Hewitt).\n\nThis fine plant is closely allied to Alpinia capitellata, Jack. and A. javanica, Bl. but a very much larger plant.\n\nZingiber longipedunculatum, n. sp.\n\nStem stout.

Anther an inch long with the long curved appendage.\n\nSingapore: Stagmount, in thick woods. In flower April 1908.\n\nThis superb species was certainly quite a surprise. I had many times explored the Stagmount woods, but had never came across this plant although I had been several times close to where this time I discovered it. It belongs to the same group as Z. gracile, Jack, and Z. Griffithii, but is very distinct in its brilliant yellow spikes, those of all the others of this group being pinkish red. It is much larger in all its parts than any other species of this section here except Z. pilberula, Ridl. which rivals it in height of stems at least. In flower spike and flower this plant is bigger than any of this section. Its deep green shining leaves and the numerous bright yellow spikes make it the most attractive of its group.\n\nPlagiostachys albiflora, n. sp.\n\nA tufted plant about six feet tall.
