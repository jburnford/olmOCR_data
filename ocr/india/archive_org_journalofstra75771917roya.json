Burkill (Hon. Secretary): also several visitors.\n\nThe minutes of the meeting of February 10th, 1916, were read and confirmed.\n\nThe Annual Report and Statement of Accounts which had been circulated in print were accepted on the motion of Mr. H. Robinson, seconded by Dr. J. A. R. Glennie.\n\nThe Hon. C. J. Saunders moved, and the Hon. H. Marriott seconded that, as recommended by the retiring Council, Dr. D. J. Galloway, a past-president, be elected an Honorary Member on account of his notable service to the Society. Dr. Galloway was elected an Honorary Member upon a show of hands.\n\nThe Hon. Treasurer explained that the Council had determined to place two thousand two hundred dollars ($2,200) from the Society's reserve funds into the Colonial War Loan and to earmark the interest therefrom for use in connection with the Library.\n\nThe following were elected consecutively office-bearers for 1917:\n\nHon.

Burkill .. Hon. Secretary.\nDr. R. Hanitsch .. Hon. Treasurer.\nMr. C. Bazell .. Hon. Librarian.\nA ballot was next taken for the election of four Councillors.\n\nOn the motion of Dr. J. A. R. Glennie, seconded by Captain A. R. Chancellor the meeting returned a vote of thanks to the retiring Council.\n\nThe President asked Mr. H. N. Ridley to give an address on the subject of the Scientific Exploration of the Malay Peninsula, while the result of the ballot for councillors was being ascertained. Mr. Ridley spoke as recorded in the Society's Proceedings:* and a discussion followed upon the means by which further work might be encouraged.\n\nThe President proposed a vote of thanks to Mr. Ridley for his address, which was accorded: and he announced that as the result of the ballot the Hon. H. Marriott, Captain J. C. Moulton and Mr. H. Robinson had been elected Councillors, that Dr. W. G. Shellabear and Professor Argyll Campbell had received an equal number of votes for the fourth place and that five other members had received votes. He suggested that as Dr. Shellabear had not returned to the Colony and as the date of his return appears uncertain, Professor Argyll Campbell should be asked to serve. On a show of hands this proposal was adopted.\n\n* pp. vii\u2014xi.\nThe Scientific Exploration of the Peninsula.\n\nAn address at the General Meeting of February 27th, 1917.\n\nBy H. N. Ridley, F.R.S., C.M.G.\n\nThe Object of the Scientific exploration of a country is to get a clear systematized knowledge of the Fauna, Flora, Ethnology, Anthropology and Geology of the country,\u2014in fact of the whole of the Natural History of the area,\u2014and to publish it in such form that it may be accessible to everyone.\n\nTo get a clear idea of the whole of Nature, its origin and development, it is not sufficient to study one group alone: for all the various sections of Natural Science have a more or less close relationship with each other; and before we can come to any satisfactory deductions from the facts in one part of the subject, we must know or be easily able to find out the stories of the other parts.\n\nIn the early days of the development of a Colony, such as ours, the study of Natural History is usually commenced by a few Amateur Naturalists, who collect specimens and observations on all branches of the subject. Later we get a few to take up special groups or subjects, individually; for it is nor possible for any one man in a lifetime to study every group in detail in so rich an area as a tropical region.\n\nLater still a Museum or Museums are formed, with scientific men attached who, assisted at least by the Government, are able to devote their time to collecting and preserving specimens, as well as recording observations and data, and storing the specimens in the Museums for reference, and publishing the information obtained in reports or publications. And here comes in the great value to the world of such societies as ours which record facts of Natural history, the geography of the country, and all that belongs to a complete knowledge of the country we live in.\n\nNow in the beginning of these researches we find that certain groups of animals are more popular than others, such as birds and butterflies, and we therefore find a larger number of collectors of these animals, and consequently we get sooner a good knowledge of these groups than we do of say beetles or molluscs; and we require a number of collectors and students of these more difficult groups to collect. In many of the country Natural History Societies at home the members contrive to get one or other of\ntheir numbers to take up a single group and devote himself to collecting that group, assisted of course by others who send him any specimens they chance upon. I do not know how far some such system could be adopted here, but there are many of our members living in distant parts of the country who could materially help by catching and sending insects or other such easily collected animals to the various naturalists who in this country are studying them.\n\nWhen I first arrived in this country in 1889, large areas of forest and mountain, now easily reached by train and motor car, were only accessible by long and difficult marches, and the few naturalists in the country found it impossible to get to these remote spots in the time and with the funds at their disposal. But the rapid development of agriculture of late years has resulted in the increased accessibility and in the settling of Europeans in parts of the Peninsula at that time out of reach. Many of these Europeans would assist in collecting if shown the way, I am sure, and indeed I have great cause to be grateful to very many who in the course of my wanderings into their districts have given me the greatest assistance in collecting plants.\n\nBut the wide developments of agriculture of late years has not been, alas, all to the advantage of the Naturalist, for the felling and burning of the forest has caused the disappearance of many plants and probably many insects and other animals; and as this work is still continuing, it becomes of more and more importance to save specimens (which is all we can do) of the vanishing flora and fauna, ere they become as extinct as Dodos.\n\nI would now like to run over the various branches of Natural Science and see how far we have progressed towards a systematic investigation and record of the separate groups as far as regards this country.\n\nIn Zoology we have already published the account of the Reptiles and Batrachia by Boulenger, and I understand the works on the Mammals and Birds are nearly complete. These have been done by the zoologists of the Federated Malay States Museum.\n\nIn fishes we have an account of those of fresh-water by Dunck, a Naturalist who was here some years ago. In Marine fish we have no separate work; but those of our seas have been mentioned in works by Bleeker and Weber, dealing with the fishes generally of the Indian and Malayan Seas.\n\nA complete separate account of those occurring in our own waters is required.\n\nOn Molluses papers have been written by De Morgan.\n\nOf Insects Butterflies have been well done many years ago by Distant in the well known book Rhopalocera Malayana but of course there have been since then many additions and corrections made.\nThe Cockroaches have been well described and figured by Dr. Hanitsch in our journal lately and I believe the Mosquitos are pretty well known.\n\nBut of the rest of the insect fauna we have only scattered papers and descriptions in journals and other works which are often inaccessible to the local student and in any case entail a lot of work in searching among descriptions of species from all manner of countries to find the ones recorded from the Malay Peninsula.\n\nThe same state of affairs rules also in nearly all the other groups of invertebrates from centipedes, and spiders to Corals and Marine organisms generally. It would be highly desirable to collect all the notes and descriptions of the various groups applying to the Malay Peninsula, and put them together and publish them in an accessible form so that we might have an idea of what amount of knowledge on these animals had been obtained already and form a base for further work.\n\nIn Botany, at least that of flowering plants and ferns, progress is being made as fast as possible. Before my arrival in the East in 1889, it was proposed by the F. M. S. Government to publish a flora based on the plants collected by Kunstler, Scorte-chini and Wray in Perak, Sir Cecil Clementi-Smith very wisely urged that the flora should not be confined to these collections, which were practically limited to the Perak mountains; but that a flora of the whole of the Malay Peninsula should be taken in hand.\n\nThe work was to be done by Dr. King and Sir Joseph Hooker: the number of plants known or collected in the Peninsula at that date was small; and King arranged to publish a preliminary series of papers known as the Materials for a Flora of the Malay Peninsula in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal. This took many years; and in fact 2 orders Euphorbiaceae and Urticaceae are not yet published. In the meantime extensive collections were made all over the Peninsula and the work got fuller and fuller as it went on. Sir George King died some years ago and Mr. Gamble, and Major Gage of the Calcutta Gardens continued the Materials, while I did the Monocotyledons and some other orders. I am now engaged in re-writing the whole flora, to be published as soon as may be in book form, condensed and largely revised and added to, so that the public may in a few years, I hope, possess a work in a few volumes so written and illustrated that they will have no difficulty in identifying any plants that they may meet with. The work will take some time as there are known between 8,000 and 9,000 species; and all that have been already described will have to be checked over and carefully re-examined. However the greater part of the Polypetalaee and Monocotyledons are already finished, and I hope in a few years to complete the work.\n\nThe Cellular plants,\u2014Mosses, Lichens, Fungi and Algae, have not been entirely neglected; but such as have been described have been published in scattered papers in various journals; and there\nis a large field for work both in collecting and investigating in these groups.\n\nConsidering the importance of tin and other minerals to the Peninsula, it seems remarkable that so long a period elapsed before any attempt was made to study the Geology of the country. Practically nothing of importance was published till the arrival of Mr. Scrivenor. Logan in Logan's journal published indeed some papers on the rocks of Singapore, but he was no geologist and the work was extraordinarily erroneous.\n\nWe have now at least several extremely valuable papers by Mr. Scrivenor; and we shall hope for many more such researches as he has made.\n\nEthnology and Anthropology we are well advanced in, thanks to the works of Skeat, Wilkinson, Robinson and many others.\n\nBut there is one branch of Natural Science which has been curiously neglected, that of Meteorology. It is true that rainfall readings have been taken and published for many years in some parts of the Peninsula; but the returns are in many cases I fear dubious; and in the earlier days of Singapore when the returns would have been exceptionally valuable, as showing us if there had been any change in the climate at all, there are so far as I know no records. The late Mr. Knight was the only person I know of, who took an interest in the subject at all. Unfortunately he published little; but he may have left notes behind him which would be worth preserving, if they could be obtained by the Society. It would be very desirable if some member of the society would take up the subject of the meteorology of the Malay Peninsula collecting and utilizing such returns and reports published during the last 50 years. The subject is one of much interest and importance.\n\nWhen I arrived in Singapore in 1889, the greater part of the Peninsula was still a blank as regards Natural History research, the few Naturalists we had then, had only been able to collect in a few of the accessible parts such as Singapore, Malacca, Penang and parts of Perak. Even the geography of the Peninsula was very far from complete as may be seen by referring to our first editions of the Map, and even now large areas of the centre and East coast have not yet been visited by any Naturalists. When this is done without doubt very many more new species will be collected in almost every group.\n\nTaking Botany again as a sample of how far we have collected specimens of all our flowering plants, I may say that by far the largest number of the plants of the low country are now well known, and it is not easy to get big additions of novelties in the low lands of either coast, and that thanks very largely to Messrs. Robinson and Kloss who have greatly added to our knowledge of the botany of the highest accessible mountains we have obtained the greater part of the flora of above 4,000 feet elevation. This does not mean that we know all the plants in our forests. It is\na poor collecting trip still which does not yield some novelties even in the low country. But we have in our 9,000 known species a very large proportion of the flora, and enough to base at least some deductions as to the origin and history of the flora of the Peninsula.\n\nWe have practically a sample collection, not a complete one.\n\nThe same thing applies, I take it, to most of the zoological groups; but I believe that I shall not be wrong in stating that in Mammals, birds, reptiles and batrachians and butterflies we have now an almost absolutely complete knowledge of the species. The number of novelties to be added is probably small. Further explorations in out of the way localities will probably yield important results in most groups. We have not enough naturalists to get over the whole ground in a short time so that the residents in these distant parts may often be able to assist in sending specimens to our museums of insects or plants or other such things that they may accidentally come across. As an example I may mention that of two new kinds of bats which some years ago I accidentally obtained I believe that neither have ever been caught again.\n\nI have now I think given some idea of the progress in Natural History that we have made here in the past quarter of a century. It is very considerable; but a great deal remains to be done. The Society by its Journal and by indirectly and directly interesting residents in the knowledge of the Natural History of the Peninsula has played an important part in this work, and I trust that it may continue to do the same for very many years to come.\nANNUAL REPORT\n\nof the\n\nStraits Branch, Royal Asiatic Society\n\nfor 1916.\n\nOn November the 4th the Society entered upon its fortieth year, having the name of one founder and of two who joined in the first year, still on the Member list,\u2014the Right Rev. Bishop Hose, the Hon. Datoh Mahomed bin Mahbob of Johore, and the Ven. Archdeacon J. Perham of Chard, Somerset. The rules under which the Society works have been little altered since they were passed at the general meeting of January 21st, 1878. On July 15th of the same year, the Society having 142 members, issued its first Journal and in December a second, making the year\u2019s output 166 pages. The Society stands, this day, with 297 names on the member list.\n\nThe number of pages in the Journal of the year under review was 358. The average for the thirty-nine completed years of publishing has been 305.\n\nThe Society in the first year of its existence met frequently for the reading of papers: but it was found impossible to maintain these meetings: and when the practice fell into disuse, it became necessary to vest in the Council powers which councils of Societies rarely possess, asking the members to meet but once a year to regulate their affairs, by the election of a new council and by the ratifying of the proceedings of the retiring body. The arrangement tends to create an aloofness on the part of the members which the Council has been most anxious to dispel: and with that intention in 1915 two steps were taken: in the first place an offer was gratefully accepted from a member, Mrs. Legrew Watkins, that at the annual meeting she would exhibit her collection of objects used by the Ainus of Japan; and in the second place it was arranged that the Journal should appear oftener, if possible, than twice a year. The attendance at the last annual meeting was gratifying and Mrs. Legrew Watkins\u2019 exhibit most interesting. The Journal, which had appeared thrice in 1915, has appeared again thrice in 1916.\n\nThe Journal is now paged into an annual volume, and has been issued complete for 1916, with title page and index. It contained xxx + 328 pages, with six plates and two line blocks in the text. Its cost to the Society was $1,217.66 or 58% of the Society\u2019s income.\nOf the income a further 22% was absorbed by salaries, stationery, postages, and other small charges essential to the running of the Society's office, leaving only 20% for the purchase of books, furniture, and for unusual causes of expense. A larger member-list, meaning a larger income, is desirable.\n\nAlso a larger inflow from members of short papers for publication is desirable.\n\nThe Hon. Treasurer's balance sheets for the last and the preceding four years show the following figures:\n\n|        | 1912   | 1913   | 1914   | 1915   | 1916   |\n|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| By member's subscriptions including life-members | 1,356.08 | 1,195.00 | 1,293.68 | 1,329.68 | 1,110.00 |\n| By sales of Journals | 503.13 | 542.41 | 425.96 | 175.98 | 478.26 |\n| By sales of Maps | 3,274.80 | 565.20 | 513.60 | 292.00 | 446.15 |\n| By investments | 189.92 | 125.49 | 86.48 | 385.75 | 250.40 |\n\nNearly half of the receipts in 1916 by sales of parts of the Journal came from the Hikayat Sri Rama, of which 51 copies were taken.\n\nThe Society's invested funds are less than a year ago by $1,500, in consequence of withdrawals from fixed deposit to meet the cost of printing the Hikayat.\n\nThe price of printing has unfortunately been raised against the Society: but this, it is trusted, will be but temporarily.\n\nThe Council has no new undertakings to record. The rule which lays it down that the object of the Society is to increase and to diffuse knowledge concerning British Malaya and the neighbouring countries has been strictly observed. One of the papers in the Journal treats of the Malay language, five of the History of the Peninsula, one of Malay customs, two of Malay plants, one of the action of a Malay poison, and two of Malay zoology. It may be recalled that the inception of the Society occurred just when the interior of the Peninsula was opened to exploration and many accounts of Journeys reached it; but such papers are rarer now. There were none in the Journal for 1916.\n\nIt has been stated above that the member list carries 297 names: that is the same as the last published list carried. By death the Society has lost two Honorary members, Sir Cecil Clementi Smith and Mr. A. Knight: and two, who were members, have lost their lives at the front in France\u2014Messrs. H. E. Pennington, and P. Gold.\n\nThe Council elected during the year the following as members:\nMr. H. W. Ford, Mr. J. W. Cundell Ellis,\nProf. J. Argyll Campbell, Mr. A. Rogers,\nMr. J. G. Watson, Mr. G. B. Kellagher,\nMr. Shiva Prasad Gupta, Mr. Ong Boon Tat.\nMr. L. Rayman. Mr. G. F. C. Woollett.\nMrs. Legrew Watkins. Mr. H. C. Abraham.\nMr. Frank H. Myers. Mr. H. H. Banks.\nMr. W. E. Mann. Mr. W. G. Stirling.\nMr. E. Stuart Young. Rev. William Cross.\nMr. Arthur Mitchell Goodman. Mr. R. Balfour Blair.\n\nHis Highness, the Raja Muda, of Sarawak, was elected an Honorary member at the last Annual meeting.\n\nCouncil. During the year Dr. R. D. Keith resigned from the Council, and in his place Captain J. C. Moulton was co-opted. The office of Vice-President, Singapore, fell vacant by the departure of the Hon. W. G. Maxwell from the Colony, but was not filled.\n\nLibrary.

Overbeck prepared and made over to the Society; and as it was considered inadequate by itself the Hon. H. Marriott has prepared another which he has presented to the Society, so that both may be preserved in the library together. Mr. Overbeck's index is by the third line, but Mr. Marriott's by the leading words. The Council's intention in preserving these is that members who interest themselves in the collection of Pantuns may easily ascertain whether such as they meet with are published or unpublished; and they consider that unpublished pantuns might well find a place in the Society's Journal.\n\nI.

The Royal Asiatic Society has its headquarters at 22, Albemarle Street, London W., where it has a large library of books, and MSS. relating to oriental subjects, and holds monthly meetings from November to June (inclusive) at which papers on such subjects are read.\n\n2. By rule 105 of this Society all the Members of Branch Societies are entitled when on furlough or otherwise temporarily resident within Great Britain, and Ireland, to the use of the Library as Non-Resident Members and to attend the ordinary monthly meetings of this Society. This Society accordingly invites Members of Branch Societies temporarily resident in Great Britain or Ireland to avail themselves of these facilities and to make their home addresses known to the Secretary so that notice of the meetings may be sent to them.\n3. Under rule 84, the Council of the Society is able to accept contributions to its Journal from Members of Branch Societies, and other persons interested in Oriental Research, of original articles, short notes, etc., on matters connected with the languages, archaeology, history, beliefs and customs of any part of Asia.\n\n4. By virtue of the afore-mentioned Rule 105, all Members of Branch Societies are entitled to apply for election to the Society without the formality of nomination. They should apply in writing to the Secretary, stating their names and addresses, and mentioning the Branch Society to which they belong. Election is by the Society upon the recommendation of the Council.\n\n5. The subscription for Non-Resident Members of the Society is 30/- per annum. They receive the quarterly journal post free.\n\n*Asiatic Society of Bengal.* Members of the Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, by a letter received in 1903, are accorded the privilege of admission to the monthly meetings of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, which are held usually at the Society\u2019s house, 1 Park Street, Calcutta.\nJOURNAL\nFlag of the Governor of the Straits Settlements\n\nColonial Ensign\nStraits Settlements\n\nFlag of the Chief Secretary\nFederated Malay States\nThe Flags of the Malay Peninsula.\n\nIn response to a request made some little time ago, the Council of the Society has decided to publish here seven plates illustrative of the flags generally recognised in the Malay Peninsula. The drawings from which the plates have been prepared were in most cases procured through members of the Society, who are at the same time Officers of the State serving in different parts of the Peninsula. For the ready way in which they gave their help, the Society's best thanks are due.\n\nThe ensign of the Straits Settlements is constructed as those of all British Colonies from the Blue Ensign, by the addition of the Colonial emblem in the fly. The same Colonial emblem wreathed in oak leaves in the centre of the Union Jack makes the Governor's flag. The device of the emblem is three crowns embayed on white in a lozenge the ground of which is red, the crowns representing the three Settlements.\n\nThe Chief Secretary of the Federated Malay States has a Jack corresponding to the Governor's in which a kris is the emblem.\n\nVery recently all the Malay States used flags as emblems which were of one colour; but as it became known in them that the self-coloured flags at sea and elsewhere had special significances for the purpose of signalling, the desirability of using something more distinctive was realised and a change has been made in every State except Tringganu. Tringganu still retains its plain white flag.\n\nPahang, its neighbour, used a plain black flag, until, as symbolical of the Union of the ruler with his people, white was associated with the black,\u2014first a narrow white band along the inner edge then an upper white half. This final design was fixed by the State Council on the 28th of December, 1903. As far as can be ascertained the flag of Kelantan was plain white up to the time when the State came under British Protection. Being white, it would not be distinctive as regards Tringganu. After the State had come under protection, a figure of a tiger was added in mid-flag coloured in the case of the State flag a very dark blue, and in His Highness the Sultan's own flag yellow, the ground remaining white as before. Similarly the Perak flags used to be self-coloured, but now the three colours, formerly employed, are combined into the one flag, In Kedah up to six years ago self-coloured flags were used. The Sultan used a plain yellow one, the Malay emblem of Royalty, the State flag was a plain red one and the late Raja Muda's a plain black. When the Sultan and his suite went to Europe for the coronation of their Majesties King George V. and Queen Mary, the\nMalays were chagrined to find that none of their old flags could be flown as they were the nautical symbols for quarantine, gunpowder and piracy, and then the device called by the Malays the \"Kedah Crown\" as superimposed on the old grounds of the Sultan's, and the State's flags; and the President of the State Council was given a green flag instead of the old black one.\n\nThe crescent of Muhammedanism appears in the Kedah flag; and the crescent and star in those of Selangor and Johore. The Selangor State flag is yellow and red in quarters with a yellow crescent and star in canton. It was devised in the reign of Sultan Abdul Samad: and the yellow and red quarterings are symbolic of flesh and blood; for, as the body is of flesh and blood so is the State a combination of necessary parts.\n\nThe Johore flag is white with the crescent and star red in canton on blue.\n\nThe Negri Sembilan flag is yellow with red and black diagonal in canton: red for the Government, yellow for the Raja, and black for the Undang or States' rulers. \"Negri Sembilan\" means \"Nine States.\"\n\nThe device of the Kelantan flag reads:\n\n\\[ \\text{Kerajaan Kelantan.} \\]\n\nNasrom minallah-hi wafat-hung karibun wabasshirel mo'minin.\nNew and Rare Malayan Plants.\n\nSeries IX.\n\nBy H. N. Ridley, F.R.S.\n\nIn continuing my work on the Flora of the Malay Peninsula, I find a number of plants in the earlier collections which have been overlooked and not described, as well as several genera in which the species, chiefly described from more or less inadequate dried specimens, seem to have been much confused; such genera are Glycosmis, Ventilago and Allophyllus. In critical genera like these a really big series of specimens is required and this we seldom possess in any tropical genus. Some also differ more in habit than in what may be called herbarium characters. In the field one could not mistake the one for the other; but specimens without adequate notes as to height, and form of growth may look so far similar that a botanist who has not seen the plants alive may easily be led into thinking that they are all mere forms of one somewhat variable species. We really want more collecting and observation done. I have been surprised to note how very badly many of our commonest plants are represented in herbaria. The collections of an amateur who, just commencing the study of botany collects every weed he can find, are often extremely valuable, as the plants he gathers are just the plants that others neglect.\n\nANONACEAE.\n\nUnona. Safford in Bull. Torrey Club, xxxix. p. 502, shows that the original species of this genus was an American plant to which were later added among others the species known as Unona in the East Indies: and eventually the original Unona discreta, Linn. fil., was actually excluded from the genus. This plant proves to be a Xylopia. The East Indian plants are quite distinct from it so that the generic name Unona disappears as a synonym of Xylopia. The earliest name for the East Indian \"Unona\" is Desmos of Loureiro and the following are the names of the Malay species of Unona now referred to that genus.\n\nDesmos cochinchinensis, Lour. Fl.

Unona filipes, Ridl.\n\nThe genus when confined to the shrubs with large rather thin flowers with two series of unequal petals and moniliform fruiting carpels forms a well-defined genus: but to it has unfortunately been added a section Stenopetalae including Desmos Wrayi, D. desmantha, D. crinita, D. stenopetala all Unonas of Hook. fil. & King, and kept in Desmos by Safford. These are small trees about 20 feet tall with the flowers and fruit exactly of Polyalthia and closely allied to P. Beccarii. The ovaries in the species referred to Unona (Desmos) contain from 2 to 5 ovules. The distinction given to Polyalthia from Unona is that it has but one or two ovules. None of the species of this supposed section of Unona have moniliform fruit, but 3 seeds are often developed.\n\nI propose to remove all of them to their correct genus Polyalthia and transfer them to their real affinity with P. Beccarii, under the names of Polyalthia Wrayi, P. desmantha, P. crinita and P. stenopetala.\n\nUnona pycnantha, Hook. fil. only known from Maingay\u2019s specimen looks to me to be a young specimen of one of these species probably P. desmantha, in which the flowers are not fully developed.\n\nPolyalthia cauliflora, Hook. fil. and Thoms., Fl. Ind. 138; Hook. fil., Fl. Brit. Ind. 1. 60, was based on Wallich\u2019s Uvaria cauliflora (Wall. Cat. 6476) a plant collected in Singapore. King omitted it altogether from the \u201cMaterials for a flora of the Malay peninsula\u201d but quoted the description in the Annals of the Botanic Gardens of Calcutta (Anonaceae) and said it was indeterminable. I have examined the type in Wallich\u2019s herbarium and find it to be identical with Polyalthia Teysmanni, Boerl., Ic. Bogor. I 107; Guatteria Teysmanni, Miq. Fl. Ind. Bat. Suppl. 378.\n\nThis species is very common in Singapore and much resembles P. Beccarii. It is a small tree with a stem 3 inches through with transversely wrinkled bark. The flowers are orange yellow, and not cinnamon brown as in P. Beccarii; the fruit is larger and sometimes at least pubescent.\n\nIt occurs in Singapore, at Chan Chu Kang (6231 of my collection), Toas river and Changi (5980); also on Gunong Panti in Johore; at Sepang in Selangor; and on the Tahan river in Pahang, usually in rather sandy open woods.\nUnona latifolia, Hook. fil., Fl. Brit. Ind. I. 60.\n\nUnona Brandisana, Pierre, Fl. Forest Cochinch. p. 19 is referred by Safford to the genus Canangium, as Canangium Brandesanum, Safford (l.c. p. 504).\n\nIt is certainly closely allied to Canangium Scortechinii having the long conic anther appendage and elongated style of that species. The style of Canangium odoratum is however quite different.\n\nIt is regrettable that Safford published the name as Canangium Brandesanum as Pierre intended to associate the plant with Sir Dietrich Brandis and called it Brandisana. It should have been in correct Latin Brandisianum.\n\nCanangium monospermum (Cananga monosperma, Hook. fil.).\n\n\u201cA tree about 5 feet high: stem about the size of a man\u2019s thumb found on the top of Gov. Hill.\u201d \u201cLarge tree with a thick stem found about half way going up Government Hill\u201d in Maingay\u2019s collections. This has been treated by Hooker and King as a doubtful plant; and the fruit with the specimens perhaps does not belong. It is no Canangium and I am very doubtful as to what it is. It has not been collected since Maingay\u2019s time; neither Curtis nor Mhd. Haniff nor I myself have been able to find it. It requires searching for again.\n\nSphaerocoryne, Scheff. ms. in Boerlage, Ic. Bogor. LXIX.\n\nThe species on which Scheffer apparently intended to base this genus, S. siamensis, was put by Boerlage into the genus Polyalthia as P. siamensis, when he described Scheffer\u2019s species. It had however been already described by Pierre, Fl. Forest. Cochinch., as Unona Mesnyi (Pl. 17). Pierre seemed doubtful as to where to place the plant, as in Herb. Kew he writes notes on it referring it also to Popowia: and Craib (Kew Bulletin, 1914, p. 5) makes a new combination of this as Popovia Mesnyi. Popovia edulis, Pierre, seems to me the same thing. Two other species closely allied to this species are Polyalthia affinis, Teijsm. and Binn., in Tijdschr. Nederl. Ind. xxvii (1864) 37; Boerlage, Ic. Bogoriensis, t. LXIII, of unknown origin cultivated at Buitenzorg and Polyalthia aberrans, Maingay in Hook. fil. Fl. Brit. Ind. i. 67 of Malacca and Perak.\n\nIt does not seem possible to refer these three plants to any of the genera suggested, and I therefore propose to keep up the proposed genus of Scheffer\u2019s Sphaerocoryne which I define below. The affinities of these plants are obscure, but they are certainly allied to Scheffer\u2019s Rauwenhoffia from which Sphaerocoryne differs mainly in its small stigmas, cylindric style and single or 2 ovules. Rauwenhoffia has very large stigmas, a very short style and many ovules.\nSphaerocoryne, Scheff. ms. genus ined.\n\nShrubs erect or scandent or small trees. Leaves coriaceous. Flowers axillary, solitary. Sepals small, ovate, valvate. Petals outer ovate, inner ones much smaller, flat not excavate at the base. Stamens oblong, numerous, connective flat, truncate.

Also in Sarawak (Beccari 3433), and Bau (Haviland 2035).\n\nAllied to *E. parvifolius*, Wall., and *E. robustus*, Roxb., which latter it resembles in having some of the leaves shewing signs of pustulations, but the leaves are quite entire and dry.\ndark brown above and red brown beneath. The sepals are very narrow and when dry at least are curiously hooked at the long acuminate tip. Haviland's plant is more pubescent and the leaves show slight signs of crenation.\n\nDr. Stapf recognized this species as distinct in the Kew Herbarium but never published his description of it.\n\n**GERANIACEAE.**\n\n**Connaropsis glabra**, n. sp.\n\nTree? branches with pale bark, glabrous.

On Hermitage Hill at 1000 feet, alt., flowering in December, (*Curtis* 1345).\n\nThis species has thinner and longer leaves, (not glaucous on the backs,) than *C. monophylla*, Planch. The panicle is laxer and the whole plant glabrous.\n\n**Connaropsis laxa**, n. sp.\n\nTree 40 to 50 feet tall, the bark of the branches pale.

Fruit globose, 2-celled, dark red. Seed 1.\n\nPerak. Taiping Hills, within 300 feet of Sea level (*Kunstler* 2384); Tea Gardens (*Curtis* 2896).\n\nThe appearance of this plant suggests a *Dapania* but it appears to be a tree and to have indehiscent fruits.\n\n**Impatiens polycycla**, Hook. fil. ms.\n\nA branched herb with nearly glabrous stem. Leaves in whorls of 2 to 5, lanceolate acuminate, narrowed to the base, serrate spinulose, with scattered long hairs on the upper sur-\nface, glaucous beneath and glabrous, nerves hardly visible 1 to 1.5 in. long, .4 in. wide; petiole .2 in. long. Stipules filiform. Peduncle 1.5 to 2 in. long. Flower patent 1 in. across, rose pink. Sepals .2 in. long, ovate caudate, glabrous, spurred one ovate lanceolate, flat, spur long and slender, 1.5 in. long. Capsule ovoid dilate in middle .5 in. long. Seed obovoid, compressed hairy .1 in. long.\n\nPerak. Temengoh on a sand bank in the river (Ridley 14591). I could find but a single plant anywhere.\n\nAllied to T. Griffithii, Hook. fil. but a more branched stouter plant, with broader leaves, hairy above with the nerves almost invisible, in whorls of 5, the lower ones in pairs. The spur is also much longer and more slender.\n\nImpatiens exilipes, Hook. fil. ms.\n\nA branched glabrous herb about 2 feet tall. Leaves opposite or in whorls of 3, broadly lanceolate acuminate, narrowed to the base, serrate spinulose, quite glabrous, beneath glaucous, nerves 6 pairs conspicuous, 3 to 4.5 in. long. .7 to 1 in. wide; petiole .5 in. long. Pedicels 2 to 3 in. long. Flowers rose pink, centre darker. Sepals ovate oblong, cuspidate, spurred one boat-shaped, mucronate, .4 in. long, spur slender 1.3 in. long. Standard obovate, cuneate, truncate with a short point and a short rounded keel, wings broad bifid, basal lobe oblong retuse, upper one obovate retuse. Capsule short .6 in. long, broadly fusiform, beaked. Seed obovoid, flattened, glabrous.\n\nPerak. On the road between Tapah and Jor, abundant at one spot (Ridley).\n\nI got this pretty balsam in the return from the expedition to Telom. Like the last species Sir Joseph Hooker examined it and made notes on it shortly before his death and gave it the above manuscript name. It belongs to the same section as the last but is distinct in being quite glabrous like I. Curtisi of the Taiping Hills but has lanceolate not ovate leaves. I. Wrayi, Hook. fil. from the same district has hairy leaves, an orbicular standard not narrowed at the base and a central raised line with an erect tooth in the centre, the wings are very unequally lobed and the seed is hairy. I. sarcantha, Hook. fil. from the Telom river has broad hairy leaves and an obovate standard, emarginate with a strong central keel running the whole length, and oblong truncate unequal lobes to the wings. The seeds are glabrous.\n\nRUTACEAE.\n\nGlycosmis. The various species of this genus of shrubs or small trees occurring in the Malay Peninsula have been reduced\nfirst by Oliver, Journ. Linn. Soc. V. Suppl. ii. 37, and later by Hooker in the Flora of British India and King in the Materials who have followed Oliver's classification, into three species only *G. pentaphylla*. Correa, the *Limonia pentaphylla* of Retz. and Roxburgh, *G. sapindoides*, Lindl. and *G. puberula*, Lindl., the greater number of the Indian and Malayan species being reduced to forms of *G. pentaphylla* \"a very variable and most perplexing species.\"\n\nThe typical *G. pentaphylla* is based upon what appears to me a very distinct species which is confined to India, and does not occur at all in our area. After examining the various plants included under the names of this and the other two species, I have come to the conclusion that the various forms, perhaps a little difficult to make out from poor herbarium specimens can be quite well distinguished into species, and are not really so variable as would at first sight appear.\n\n**G. citrifolia**, Lindl. Hort. Soc. Trans. VI. 72. *Limonia parviflora*, Bot. Mag. t. 2416. ?*G. simplicifolia*, Spreng. Syst. Veg. IV. 2, p. 162; Miq. Fl. Ind. Bat. I. ii. 521.\n\nA short stiff shrub about 5 feet tall, with thinly coriaceous 1- to 3-foliolate leaves, elliptic lanceolate or oblanceolate, narrowed to the base, shortly blunt apiculate; nerves very fine, nervules nearly as conspicuous, usually distinctly gland-dotted, 4\u20145 in. to 6 in. long and 1.5 in. wide; petiole 1\u20142.5 in. long, petiolule .1 in. long. The panicles are axillary and terminal, erect and spike-like about .5 to 2 in. long, the peduncle .1\u2014.75 in. long, but occasionally much longer. The flowers fairly numerous, are sessile or nearly so, .1 in. long. Sepals ovate acute, stiff; petals about twice as long, oblong obtuse. Stamens with linear-subulate filaments and very small anthers elliptic or elliptic lanceolate. Ovary 3\u20144-lobed, flask-shaped on a small disc, papillose, glabrous. Fruit as big as a pea, pale pink, translucent.\n\nThis plant does not appear to be very common in the Malay Peninsula, but I have it from Tanglin in Singapore from the heaths in Setul, and Kampongs at Kota Bahru, Kelantan.\n\nIt is abundant in Hongkong, and Java, Bandong (*Forbes* 1215): and also occurs in Dutch Borneo, Banjermasin (*Motley* 271), British North Borneo (*Fraser*): Philippines (*Cuming* 1200; *Loher* 215), Manila (*Merrill* 112778).\n\nThe form with unifoliolate leaves, has usually stiffer and larger leaves and is probably the *G. lanceolata*, Spreng. It occurs also in French Guyana (*Glycosmis americana*, Sagot) and Jamaica. \"According to Dr. Broughton it was introduced into Jamaica from England under the name of Mandarin orange in 1788 by Hinton East, Esq.\" (note in Herb. Kew). These American forms, undoubtedly both introduced, resemble\nthe Hongkong plant in having a tomentose inflorescence. The Malayan form is quite glabrous.\n\n**G. macrocarpa**, Wight, Ill. i. 109.\n\nA tree or shrub quite glabrous. Leaves 1- to 5-foliolate on the same plant, subcoriaceous, the trifoliolate leaflets are lanceolate, distant acuminate, shortly narrowed to the base, 3 in. long, .7 in. wide, petiolule .1 in.; the unifoliolate leaflets elliptic lanceolate, acuminate, base shortly narrowed, .75 in. long, 2.7 in. wide, very finely gland-dotted, nerves often distinctly elevate beneath in the larger leaflets, 8 pairs. The flowers white are .2 in. long 2 to 3 on very stout axillary racemes in the only Malay specimen I have seen, in terminal clusters .5 in. long in the Indian type, rachis and calyx scurfy. Sepals short ovate. Petals quite 3 times as long, linear oblong, subacute. Stamens with broad truncate linear filaments and short oblong anthers. Ovary glabrous, cylindric on a moderately large disc. Berry .75 in. long, globose with 2 large plano-convex seeds.\n\n**Perak.** At 4500 feet, \u201ca tree, flowers white\u201d (Wray 264). **South India:** Courtallum (Wight).\n\nA very distinct plant in its large flowers and very large fruit as big as a cherry. Wight gives it as shrubby, Wray as a tree.\n\n**G. malayana**, n. sp.\n\nA glabrous shrub, about 6 feet tall, with light green leaves. Buds red tomentose. Leaves 5-foliolate, thin, submembranous, leaflets elliptic, bluntly acuminate, shortly narrowed at the base, nerves 5 pairs impressed above conspicuously elevate beneath, inarching .3 in. within the margin, very finely gland-dotted above, sometimes but not always beneath, 3.5\u20145.5 in. long, 1\u20142 in. wide, petiole .5\u20141 in. long, petiolules .1\u20142 in. long. Panicles axillary and terminal 2\u20143 in. long, branches spreading 1 in. long, glabrous, rarely red scurfy. Buds globose. Sepals orbicular ciliate on the edges. Filaments broad, flat. Ovary cylindro-conic, 5-celled, glabrous. Fruit white, globose, narrowed at the base, .2 in. through.\n\n**Singapore.** Chan Chu Kang (Ridley 3912). **Johore.** Bukit Murdom (Kelsall), and Sedenah (Ridley 13508). **Selangor.** Kuala Lumpur. **Perak.** Larut (King\u2019s Collector 2035, 2839). **Penang.** (Wallich 6373D); Muka Head (Curtis 722); Government Hill (Maingay).\n\nThis is our commonest species. The very smooth leaves with strong elevate nerves beneath and very inconspicuous nervules and reticulation beneath are very characteristic points. Frequently they are not at all gland-dotted but in the more northern Perak and Penang specimens conspicuously so.\nK\u00fcnstler's specimen No. 2035 described as a tree 20\u201430 feet tall has a tomentose inflorescence. This is unusual though the buds in all specimens are red tomentose. The Penang plants have more distinct nervules and reticulations and are gland-dotted on both sides, and the branchlets are pustular, while the inflorescence is much more copiously branched and compact. In this it approaches *G. sapindoides*, Lindl. In the Kew herbarium specimens have been tentatively named *G. chlorosperma*, Spreng., the description of which is too incomplete to identify any species by, but as the type was obtained in Java where this species does not seem to occur, it is probable that that species is something else.\n\n**G. sapindoides**, Lindl. in Wall. Cat. 6373; Hook. fil. Fl. Brit. Ind. I. 501, was collected by Wallich in Penang in 1822. The leaves are 5- to 7-foliolate with 11 or 12 pairs of fairly well elevated nerves and conspicuous nervules and reticulations, the branches are pustular, the inflorescence fascicled racemose axillary short and red tomentose, the ovary is rufous tomentose at the base.\n\nThe plant collected by Maingay on Government Hill, Penang, described in his field note as 30 feet high and as thick as a man's thumb, is quite glabrous, and has a terminal inflorescence; so I refer it to *G. malayana*. No one has apparently seen *sapindoides* since Wallich's time.\n\n**G. macrophylla**, Lindl. Wall. Cat. 6377, not of Miquel.\n\nA shrub 2\u20143 feet tall. Leaves always simple, thinly coriaceous, elliptic, narrowed slightly at the base, acuminate, frequently not gland-dotted, pale beneath, nerves strongly elevate beneath 10 pairs inarching shortly within the margin, reticulations conspicuous, 8 in. long, 3.5 in. wide, petiole thick .2\u20141 in. long. Panicles terminal, or 1 axillary in the uppermost leaf axil, 2.5 in. long with very short branches .1 in. long. The flowers very small in umbels at the end of the branches. The sepals ovate not ciliate. The petals short oblong. Ovary conic cylindric, glabrous on a very large disc.\n\nPenang.

Leaves simple, very coriaceous, oblong, elliptic lanceolate, narrowed to the base, bluntly acuminate, gland-dotted above, less conspicuously beneath, nerves fine not elevate inconspicuous, 10 pairs, nervules nearly as conspicuous, reticulations very inconspicuous, 8 in. long, 2.1 in. wide, petiole thick .5 in. Flowers small sessile in very short axillary clusters .1 in. long, very few in the cluster, rhachis and ovate sepals red tomentose. Petals broadly lanceolate blunt, glabrous. \"Stamens short 'connective of anthers with a glandular blunt apiculus.\" Ovary conoid cylindric, glabrous. \"Fruit fleshy.\"\n\nMalacca. (Maingay 3374).\n\nA very curious plant of which I have only seen a single specimen of Maingay's with one open flower. The coriaceous simple leaves and small flowers in very small axillary clusters distinguish it readily from any other species. Hooker referred it to the var. longifolia, Oliv. of G. pentaphylla, an Assam plant which I think is distinct though allied.\n\nG. monticola, n. sp.\n\nShrub glabrous. Leaves 5 in. long, leaflets 5, coriaceous, dotted above, narrow lanceolate, acuminate cuspidate tip blunt, base long, narrowed, cuneate, nerves 6 pairs faint, 3 to 4 in. long, .5 to 1 in. wide, petiolules .1 in. long.

Koh Samui (Robinson).\n\nA plant very closely allied to G. rupestris, if not identical specifically, was collected at Montalban in the Philippines in the Province of Rizal (Loher 6767 and 6774) but the leaves are all unifoliolate.\n\nBURSERACEAE.\n\nSantiria laxa, King. Canarium laxum, Benn.\n\nThe female flowers of this tree have not been described. They are distinctly larger than the male flowers, the blunt oblong petals being .3 in. long and are borne on longer slender pedicels, .5 in. or more in length. The stamens (abortive) are as long as the pistil, the anther thick linear and blunt, longer a little than the filament. The ovary is thick oblong and somewhat distinctly 3-lobed. The stigma sessile, large three-lobed, thick and overlapping the ovary.\n\nIcicaster Planchoni, n. gen.\n\nI found the genus Icicaster for the plant formerly known\nas *Santiria Planchoni*, Benn. Fl. Brit. Ind. I. 536 and Engler, Mon. Phan. IV. 154. *Canarium Planchoni*, King, Mat. Mal. Pen. p. 482.\n\nPlanchon named it *Icicopsis* in Herb. Hook., but this generic name was never published and Engler unfortunately used it for certain American plants now reduced to *Icica*. In the Pflanzenfamilien it is put as a section of *Santiria* under the name *Icicopsis*, and *Trigonochlamys* is also put as a section of *Santiria*.\n\nThe plant in fruit resembles *Trigonochlamys Griffithii* except for the small calyx lobes but the flowers are small and resemble those of a *Santiria* except that they have but three stamens.\n\nThe characters of the genus *Icicaster* may thus be given. A tree with pinnate leaves of 7 to 13 leaflets, unisexual. Panicles axillary, shorter than the leaves. Flowers small crowded near the tips of the branches. Calyx campanulate deeply cleft into 3 ovate triangular lobes, small. Petals 3, slightly larger, deltoid. Stamens three, anthers ovate, filaments shorter, flat, inserted on the edge of a large cupular fleshy disc. Ovary in the female flowers small, ovate, three-lobed. Style terminal, short. Stigma 3-lobed. Drupe ovoid globular, slightly gibbous, style persistent, slightly lateral.\n\nIt appears to be not rare in the south of the Peninsula in Singapore, Malacca and Perak as far north as Taiping. The fruit is yellow and bead-like.\n\n**MELIACEAE.**\n\n*Amoora malaccensis*, n. sp.\n\nTree, bark of branches wrinkled, young branches red pubescent (when dry).

Ayer Panas (Goodenough; Ridley 1797) flowers; (Maingay 1455) fruit.\n\nNearest to *A. lanceolata*, Hiern, but the leaves are thinner, larger and less coriaceous with more distinct nerves, the flowers are smaller and glabrous, the staminal tube has rounded short lobes.\n\n**Aglaia rufibarbis**, Ridl.\n\nI find that the plant described by me in the Journ. Roy. As. Soc. Str. Branch vol. 54, p. 32, as *Aglaia rufa*, Miq. is not that species but is a distinct and previously undescribed one. I therefore give it the name of *A. rufibarbis*.\n\n**Dysoxylon pulchrum**, n. sp.\n\nA small tree, glabrous except the flowers. Leaf over a foot long, rhachis stout. Leaflets more than 11, alternate, rather distant, coriaceous, oblong, rather abruptly blunt acuminate, base cuneate or broadly rounded, equilateral or very nearly so, midrib stout, prominent beneath, nerves 11 pairs, slender but prominent beneath, 8\u20149 in. long, 3\u20143.5 in. across, petiolules .2\u2014.3 in. long, stout.

Leaves 5 in. long; leaflets 5, thin membranous, glaucous beneath, elliptic acuminate acute, base rounded or shortly cuneate, nerves about 8 pairs, elevate beneath, reticulations fine, conspicuous when dry, 2\u20144 in. long, 1\u20141.5 in. wide, 1.5 in. apart on the rhachis; petiolules .2 in. long.

Tomoh (Machado).\nNative name \"Akar Surukop.\"\n\nThis plant appears to me to be quite distinct from the Hongkong plant, the flowers of which are larger and in umbellate cymes on the ends of branches, not as in this case in racemes of small cymes. The petals are smaller and narrower, and the fruit smaller, the valves being as long as they are wide.\n\n**Microtropis valida**, n. sp.\n\nBranches stout. Leaves thickly coriaceous, shining, elliptic, acuminate acute, base cuneate, 3.5 to 6 in. long, 1.5 to 3 in. wide, nerves 6 to 8 pairs, slender, nervules and reticulations equally prominent on both sides, petiole thick grooved .5 in. long.

Wrayi* which is probably its nearest ally.\n\n**Salacia rubra**, Lawson in Hook. fil., Flora of British India, I. 627.\n\nOf this dubious plant collected formerly by Maingay, who had only fruiting specimens, we have now adequate material, collected in the garden jungle in Singapore by me, (No. 10164 of my collections), so I give a complete description of it.\u2014A climbing shrub with whitish bark. Leaves opposite, elliptic cuspidate, narrowed to the base entire, coriaceous and drying dark brown, nerves 5 to 6 pairs, faint inarching far from the\nmargin, 3.5 in. long, 2 in. wide, petiole .2 in. long. Flowers .15 in. across in fascicles of 5 or 6, pedicels 2 in. long, slender. Calyx flat, lobes short, blunt, rugose. Petals lanceolate, obtuse, rather fleshy with a keel on the back. Stamens 3 from the top of the disc which is tall and fleshy; filaments short, linear recurved rather broad, anthers rounded, elliptic. Ovary quite immersed in the disc. The fruit about 1 in. through, rugose bright red.\n\n**S. verrucosa**, Wight Ill. i. 134 (1831). This is identical with *S. polyantha*, Korthals, Flora, XXXI (1848) 379, and is the earlier name. It is a native of Mergui and Borneo and has been collected also at Tongkah, and Lankawi by Curtis.\n\n**S. ovalis**, Lawson l.c. 627: *S. Lawsonii*, King in the Materials, appears to me to be nothing more than a state of the common *S. flavescens*, Kurz.\n\n**S. Lobbii**, Lawson, seems to be merely a form of *S. Maingayi*, Lawson.\n\n**Salacia Korthalsiana**, Miq.; *S. radula*, Hassk. Pl. Jav. p. 231 (not of Don.).\n\nA climbing shrub with rather large alternate coriaceous leaves, oblong with a short blunt point; nerves elevate beneath the 7 pairs, 7 in. long and 2.75 in. wide. Flowers in small cymes at the ends of axillary panicles with rather thick dichotomous branches, 1.5 in. long, including the rather long peduncle. Sepals rounded, 5. Petals oblong, yellow, .1 in. long. Disc rather large and thick. Fruit ovoid blunt, .75 in.\n\n**Singapore.** Bukit Timah Road at 7\u00bd miles (*Hullett* 905). Also occurs in Java.\n\nThis plant has been omitted by King from the Materials. It does not appear to be common anywhere. The branches are in Javanese specimens especially dotted over with raised lenticels hence the name *S. radula*, but Hullett\u2019s plant hardly shows them. The long stalked inflorescence is peculiar, and gives it the appearance of a *Hippocratea*.\n\n**Hippocratea nigricaulis**, n. sp. *H. macrantha*, King l.c. 357, not of Korthals.\n\nSlender climber 10 to 30 feet long, stem black, rough. Leaves coriaceous, shining, bright green, elliptic, blunt, rounded at the base, crenulate sometimes very slightly, nerves 6 pairs, elevate beneath, 2\u20145 in. long, 1.3 to 2.75 in. wide, petiole .01 in. long. Panicles 1 in. long, red puberulous. Flowers .3 in. across, pale yellow or greenish yellow. Calyx cupular with broad shallow teeth. Petals triangular lanceolate, minutely puberulous, outside, quite glabrous within. Disc deep fleshy,\nglabrous with some minute hairs on the upper part. Fruit elliptic oblong of 2 carpels 3.2 in. long, .75 in. wide, thin woody striate. Seeds 2.25 in. long.\n\nMalacca. In forests, (Griffith). Selangor. Rawang Camphor forest (Ridley). Perak. Larut Hills (Kunstler 7570, 5118). Penang. Government Hill (Ridley). Burma. Assam. Duffla Hills (King's collector 83). Bengal. Chittagong (Lister).\n\nThis plant was referred by King to *H. macrantha*, Korth. Verh. Nat. Gesch. 187 t. 39 which plant is undoubtedly the same thing as *H. Cumingii*, Laws. Flor. Brit. Ind. I. p. 624. Korthal's figure and a specimen from him in Herb. Kew clearly represent the river-bank plant known as *H. Cumingii*. The black rugose stem, crenate leaves very variable in size, red pubescent inflorescence, absence of hairs on the petals and larger fruit distinguish *H. nigricaulis*, Korth. readily from the true *H. macrantha*.\n\n**H. macrantha**, Korth. is not rare in the south of the Malay Peninsula, Borneo and the Philippines. There is a specimen from the Hookerian Herbarium at Kew labelled Ceylon collected by Colonel Walker. It does not seem to have been met with in Ceylon again and the specimen was perhaps from Singapore where also Colonel Walker collected. It occurs on the banks of tidal rivers and is called Akar Bintang by the Malays from its yellow star-shaped flowers.\n\n**H. ferruginea**, King. An examination of the type plant of *Salacia Griffithii*, Lawson Fl. Brit. Ind. I. 628, shows that this plant collected by Griffith in Malacca is no *Salacia* at all but *Hippocratea ferruginea*, King.\n\n**RHAMNACEAE.**\n\n**Ventilago.** The species of this genus have been very much confused in the Flora of British India and in King's Materials for a Flora of the Malay Peninsula, and the whole genus confined to the Indo-Malayan region with outliers in China and Formosa requires revision. The type of the genus is *V. madraspatana*, Gaertn. a native of India as far as Mergui. It has not been met with apparently in Java, for the plants so identified belong to a distinct species. *V. calyculata*, Tul. has much the same distribution, but occurs also in Siam and Cochinchina. Its curious yellow fruits covered half way by the cupshaped calyx and entirely pubescent distinguish it readily.\n\n**Ventilago leiocarpa**, Benth. in Journ. Linn. Soc. V. 77; Fl. Hongkongensis was described shortly from plants from Hongkong collected by Champion, some of Griffith's Malacca plants and\na West African plant collected by Barter. All these separate gatherings belong to distinct species, which merely have in common the covering of the nut half way up by the calyx. It seems probable that Bentham first employed the name *leiocarpa* for the Hongkong plant and for that it had better be kept. It has nearly entire small leaves, branches quite glabrous, flowers in cymes of 3, axillary in the axils of full-sized leaves; the fruit has the nut covered for a quarter of its length only by the cupshaped calyx and its wing is slightly narrowed towards the base and acute at the tip.\n\n**V. malaccensis**, n. sp. *V. leiocarpa*, Benth. in part. (Malacca specimens).\n\nA big climber, branchlets velvety pubescent. Leaves elliptic acuminate, rather abruptly and bluntly, base shortly narrowed; edge bluntly serrate, 2.5 to 3.5 in. long, 1.25 to 2 in. wide, thinly coriaceous, drying dark brown, nerves 4\u20148 pairs, prominent beneath, faint and sunk above, petiole pubescent thick grooved .2 in. long. Flowers in compact axillary cymes of about 12 or more, and about .15 across on slender pubescent branches with small leaves about 1 in. long soon caducous so that the branches eventually appear as panicles often over 6 in. long. Bracts ovate acute, pubescent, pedicels .1 in. long, glabrous. Buds flattened at top, bluntly 4-angled, glabrous. Calyx campanulate, lobes 5, triangular acute, glabrous with a keel on the inner face near the tip. Petals much smaller, spatulate bilobed, lobes rounded. Stamens a little longer, filament slender, anthers small. Ovary immersed in disc, hairy. Styles 2. Nut globose, covered half way by the calyx, .2 in., wing oblong linear blunt, glabrous, not narrowed at the base, 2 in. long, .3 in. wide.\n\n**Singapore.** (*Cantley* 190). **Malacca.** (*Maingay* 1669, 1148, 406, 408, 1670; *Griffith*). **Perak.** Larut (*Kunstler* 3461, 7644), Batang Padang district (*Kunstler* 7750). **Penang.** Chalet (*Curtis*). **Borneo.** Rejang (*Haviland* 2863).\n\nThere is a considerable amount of variation in specimens as to size of leaves, amount of serrulation and development of panicle. Some specimens have small but well developed leaves on the slender branches which bear the flowers, but these are never as large as the stem-leaves and appear to fall off very soon. In many specimens I see no trace of these leaves, so that the whole inflorescence forms a panicle with numerous branches bearing the small scattered cymes. Occasionally the branchlets appear to be glabrous.\n\n*V. gracilis*, Rolfe and Merrill, is apparently closely allied but the flowers are pubescent. I am very doubtful about *V. lucens*, Miq. of Sumatra. The description is hardly adequate and the only specimen I have seen in Herb. Kew has rather\nstiffy coriaceous leaves not narrowed to the petiole but with a short rounded point like a small form of *V. Maingayi*.\n\n**V. gladiata**, Pierre, Fl. Forest. Cochinch. t. 314, C.\n\nLeaves lanceolate acuminate, narrowed to the base, membranous, minutely serrulate and minutely pustulate on the back, nerves 6 pairs, slender elevate beneath, transverse nervules not seen, 2.6\u20143 in. long, 1\u20141.1 in. wide, petiole .15 all glabrous. Inflorescence axillary racemes the cymes very small and few flowered, rhachis puberulous. Flowers unknown. Fruit glabrous, pedicel .1 in. long, nut .2 in. globose enclosed in the calyx cup for \u00be its length, wing lanceolate narrowed to the base and acute at the tip, 2.5 in. long, .4 in. wide.\n\n**Perak.** Sungei Larut (*Wray* 2276).\n\nDistrib. Cambodia.\n\n**V. oblongifolia**, Bl. Bijdr. 1144; Miq. Fl. Ind. Bat. I. i. 640.\n\n*Smythea macrocarpa*, var. *pubescens*, King.\n\nA stout liane with membranous lanceolate acuminate acute leaves, base rounded serrate, glabrous on both sides or tomentose beneath, nerves 7 to 9 pairs, strongly elevate beneath, 4 to 4.5 in. long, 1.5 to 1.75 in. wide; petiole .1 in. or less. Inflorescence axillary or terminal, rhachis rather stout, tomentose; branches \u00bc in. long with distant cymes of several flowers. Fruit glabrous, nut .2 in. long, ovoid: calyx not enclosing it: wing linear oblong obtuse twisted at the base 3.1 in. long, .5 in. wide.\n\n**Selangor.** Batu Caves (*Ridley* 13349). **Perak.** Waterfall hill (*Wray* 2211, *Scortechini*).\n\nDistrib.

Supp. 331.\n\nThis plant seems to be distributed over the sea shores from the South of the Peninsula, from Singapore, Serangoon (*Ridley* 9151), Bajau (3592a), Toas (6379), Johore, Scudai river (12211), Tana Runto (1917) to Penang, Pulau Jerajak (*Curtis* 2424) and also Pulau Sangian, Borneo, Timorlaut, Aru, New Guinea and Philippines to the Fiji Islands.\n\n**AMPELIDACEAE.**\n\n**Vitis pyrrodasys**, n. comb. *Cissus pyrrhodasys*, Miq. Fl. Ind. Bat. Suppl. 517 is in King\u2019s Materials, put as a synonym of *V. adnata*, Wall. Cat. It seems to be abundantly distinct in its dense red tomentum covering the stem and the backs of\n\n*R. A. Soc., No. 75, 1917.*\nthe leaves, *V. adnata*, Wall. having only a thin rusty pubescence in place of it. I have not seen it from the Malay Peninsula.\n\n**V. glaberrima**, Wall. in Roxb. Fl. Ind. (ed. Carey II. 476) is given as a synonym of *V. hastata*, Miq. by King on the ground that Wallich distributed a mixture of this and another species which he described as *V. cerasiformis*, Teysm. var. *Wallichii* and that the description agrees with *V. hastata*, Miq. Carefully reading the description however I find that it does not apply at all to the latter species but it is a good description of the plant King describes as *V. cerasiformis* var. *Wallichii*. It seems to be a very distinct species and not very common. The fruit is by no means large.\n\n**V. hastata**, Miq. is a common and conspicuous plant in Singapore, and occurs in Pahang at Pekan, in Malacca, Selangor, Province Wellesley, Perak and Lankawi, also in Sumatra and Borneo. It is easily recognised by its square-winged stem, almost white and succulent, and bright red tendrils. The flowers in moderately large cymes with red tinted peduncles, have a cup-shaped entire calyx of a pale green. The petals are oblong thick and shoe-shaped, excavate, reddish outside with a darker red spot at the tip, widely expanded in flower. The filaments narrowed upwards are green, anthers short, oblong, yellowish edged red. The disc is flat, rather thick with wavy margins, orange colour. The ovary immersed in it is pale green, the style stout and shorter than the stamens with a capitate yellow stigma. The flowers have a faint scent of cowslips. The fruit small and black. The glaucous stems and red tendrils with the red tinted flowers give it quite a pleasing appearance.\n\n**Vitis (Tetrastigma) Curtisi**, n. sp.\n\nStem smooth, black, terete. Leaves trifoliate; leaflets coriaceous, glabrous, entire, obovate cuspidate, narrowed to the base, nerves about 8 pairs, nervules and reticulations as prominent, 2.5 to 3.6 in. long, 1.3 to 1.9 in. wide, petiolules .2 in. long, median one .4. Petiole .5 in. Cymes numerous .3 in. long, graceful, spreading, compound, puberulous. Flowers .1 in. long, pedicels as long. Calyx very short, cup-shaped. Petals oblong, apex incurved fleshy, 4. Stamens shorter: filaments broad linear. Ovary globose, free. Stigma large, conic, lobed.\n\nPenang. Government Hill, close to Gun Hill (*Curtis* 3363).\n\n**Vitis polystachya**, Wall. Cat. 6028.\n\nKing and Planchon both say \"in part;\" but the type is a single specimen from herb. Finlayson. *V. nitida*, Lawson\nfrom Penang is the same. *V. polythyrsa*, Miq. a much more slender plant does not occur in the Malay Peninsula at all; nor does *V. thyrsiflora*, Miq. which resembles *V. polystachya*, but is very thickly tomentose instead of being nearly glabrous beneath the leaves. All the specimens put under these two species quoted by King, which I have seen, are *V. polystachya*, Wall.\n\n**V. capillaris**, n. sp.\n\nSlender vine; stem arachnoid hairy. Leaves compound, petiole 1.75 long, base thickened and red hairy, leaflets membranous, central one elliptic lanceolate rather abruptly narrowed to a broad or acute mucronate point 2.5 in. long, 1 in. wide, petiolule short red hairy, lateral petiolules .3 in. long, blade hairy trifoliate, uppermost leaflet biggest, lanceolate acuminate, laterals oblique narrowed to base, sparsely toothed on the outer edge, nerves 3\u20144 pairs, slender, hairy beneath, .5\u20141.5 in. long, .4\u2014.9 in. wide. Peduncle 4 in. long, slender pubescent, panicle 2.75 in. long, branches .5 in. long or less, all pubescent, lower ones branched again. Flowers distichous, .05 in. sessile. Calyx cup-shaped, obscurely 4-toothed, glabrous. Petals 4, oblong. Ovary conic, style conic, stout.\n\nBorneo. Sarawak (*Beccari*, 748).\n\nNearest to *V. polythyrsa*, Miq. but much more slender, much less hairy, leaves thinner, leaflets fewer-nerved and toothed and more oblique.\n\n**V. pterisanthella**, n. sp.\n\nA slender vine nearly completely glabrous except the inflorescence. Leaves trifoliate, membranous, petiole 1.2\u20142 in. long, leaflets thin, elliptic acuminate nearly entire with about three short obscure teeth towards the apex, narrowed at the base, median elliptic lanceolate, laterals with an oblique rounded base, nerves very fine and inconspicuous, 6 pairs, median 2.75\u20144 in. long, 1.2\u20142 in. wide; petiolule .4\u2014.6 in. long; laterals smaller; petiolule .2, a few red hairs at the base of the petiolules. Inflorescence very slender, 3.5 in. long, peduncle nearly 3, bearing a slender tendril 1.5 in. long and sometimes twining itself. Spikes few, about 7, .4 in. long, pubescent, rhachis at base flattened broadly and narrowed to tip. Flowers distichous, pubescent, .05 in. long, sessile. Calyx lobes ovate, subacute. Petals 4, much larger, puberulous outside. Stamens 4, anthers large, oblong, filaments short. Ovary subglobose with a thick conic style, glabrous.\n\nBorneo. Sarawak; Siul (*Ridley*).\n\nI collected this very curious vine in September 1905 in the forests on the Siul Hill near Kuching. It seems most nearly allied to *V. capillaris*, Ridl., but is very peculiar in the\nrhachis of the branches of the inflorescence being flattened as in *Pterisanthes* and the flowers distichous on the edge. It has the peduncular tendril of *Pterisanthes* which however occurs also in species of *Ampelocissus* and on the whole seems a connecting link between *Pterisanthes* and *Ampelocissus*.\n\n**Pterisanthes Dalhousiae**, Planch.\n\nThis species was described by Planchon from a specimen from \u201cIndes Orientales? Lady Dalhousie in herb. Delessert ex herb. Graham 1846.\u201d As no species of the genus has been met with except in the Malay Peninsula and Archipelago it is as he suggests improbable that it came from India. The description given is very short but it applies very fairly well to a plant collected by Mr. Curtis in Penang except that the leaves are smaller. Planchon gives no measurements of his specimen unfortunately, but says that they are much smaller than those of *P. cissoides*, \u201c3\u20144 cent. de long sur \u00bd\u20141 cent. de large.\u201d\n\nI do not quite understand the passage. In the herbarium of Kew is a coloured drawing of a plant evidently this, of unknown origin from \u201cPrince of Wales Island.\u201d Lady Dalhousie we know did collect in Penang.\n\n**Leea saxatilis**, n. sp.\n\nA low herbaceous plant. Leaves pinnate, petiole 18 in. long to 3 feet, smooth, red, leafy portion 12 in. or more, rhachis when young sparsely hairy, leaflets 9, oblong lanceolate acuminate with a long acute point, base rounded slightly oblique, terminal one larger narrowed to base, serrate or biserrate, submembranous above, glabrous with an elevate midrib beneath, the nerves 12\u201413 pairs elevate slender hairy tomentose, nervules and reticulations conspicuous, 4\u20147 in. long, 2 in. wide; terminal one 7 in. long, 2.6 in. wide; petiolules lowest .6 in., median .4, terminal 1 in. long. Flowers in a dense capitulum .75 in. through on a peduncle hairy .5 to 1.5 in. long, dull red, small globose. Bracts ovate acuminate hairy. Calyx thin, 5-lobed mucronate hairy. Petals as long, oblong obtuse, glabrous, calyptrate. Stamens with filaments long, anthers large oblong, urceolus with blunt rounded lobes. Fruit dull red, dry elliptic, depressed, .3 in. across, 5-lobed on a peduncle 3 in. long and a cyme of 1 in.\n\nSelangor.

Panicles in the terminal axils short. Calyx tube red spathaceous, .2 in. long, split on one side. Petals twice as long, linear oblong, white. Ovary pubescent. Fruit obovoid, smooth, light brown, fleshy, 2.5 in. to 4 or 5 in. long.\n\nSelangor. Rantau Panjang (Ridley). Perak. Gunong Pondok (Kunstler). Penang. Telok Bahang (Curtis 3005), and Penara Bukit (Curtis 1527), Moniots Road (Ridley).\n\nNative name \u201cRengas Kerbau Jalang,\u201d i.e. Buffalo on the warpath, on account of its poisonous character.\n\nI have seen no good flowers of this plant though it does not seem to be rare. Some of the specimens I at first thought were *Gl. Wrayi*, King, but having seen good specimens of that species at Kew, I am now sure it is a distinct species. Malay collectors are very shy of gathering specimens of any of the Rengas plants, *Gluta* and *Melanorrhea*, as they are apt to be poisoned by them.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 75, 1917.\nLEGUMINOSAE.\n\nBauhinia monticola, n. sp.\n\nA slender glabrescent climber. Leaves ovate deltoid, tip acuminate very shortly bifid or entire, coriaceous glabrous, nerves 7, 2\u20142.5 in. long, 1.5\u20142 in. wide, petiole 1 in. long. Racemes short 1\u20142 in. long lax glabrous or nearly so. Pedicels long slender 1.5 in. long sparsely hairy. Bracts minute caducous. Buds ovoid. Calyx tube cylindric .4 in. long red, appressed hairy; lobes ovate .3 in. long hairy. Petals oblong obtuse, conspicuously veined when dry, sparsely hairy on the back, claw .1 in. long, blade .7 in. long, .5 in. wide. Stamens very short hairy at base. Ovary stalked, cylindric red-hairy on the sutures, .2 in. long. Style almost half as long, hairy on the upper edge. Stigma large peltate.\n\nSelangor. Gunong Menkuang at 5000 ft. (Robinson). Perak. Gunong Kerbau, 4500\u20145500 ft. (Robinson).\n\nThis plant is certainly allied to B. Kingii, Prain, for which I at first mistook it and to B. cornifolia, Bak, but it has much larger flowers than either of these species. The flowers are apparently red. It belongs to the big set of showy Bauhinias which with their masses of yellow flowers turning red, make such a magnificent show in our forests, a group very characteristic of the Malay Peninsula for few of them seem to occur elsewhere.\n\nBauhinia holosericea, n. sp.\n\nA big climber, branches, petioles and inflorescence densely red velvety. Leaves coriaceous, orbicular cordate, entire or retuse at the tip, nerves 7 or 9 elevated beneath, glabrous above, densely red velvety beneath on the nerves and reticulations, less so on the rest of the surface, 2\u20142.5 in. long, 2.4\u20143 in. wide, petiole 1.25 in. long. Panicles of a few stout axillary and terminal racemes from 2.5 lengthening to 5 in. long, the branches with numerous distinct elevated scars where the flowers have fallen, densely red, velvety. Bracts lanceolate acuminate, .1 in. long. Pedicels slender .6 in. long. Buds ovate acute with a shorter tube. Calyx tube cylindric, dilate at base, .2 in. long, lobes oblong 2 in. long, hairy. Petals oblong, rather short clawed, very red hairy .35 in. long, .2 in. wide, apparently red. Stamens fertile, 3, glabrous. Ovary hairy all over. Style about as long, slender, glabrous. Stigma peltate. Pod woody, firm, .8 in. long, 2.5 in. wide, oblong blunt, slightly narrowed at the tip. Seeds flat orbicular 1.1 in. long.\n\nPerak. Forests at Temengoh (Ridley 14674).\n\nThis also belongs to the same group as the last, but seems distinct from any species in its very velvety stem, round leaves, and thick velvety racemes of which the rhachis is rough with\nthe short processes from the base of the pedicel scars. The panicles are mostly really reduced to simple racemes, but occasionally have one or two branches.\n\n**Crudia lanceolata**, n. sp.\n\nA glabrous tree. Leaves with a rachis 1.5 in. long; leaflets 3, subcoriaceous lanceolate or ovate acuminate obtuse, base rounded, quite glabrous, nerves fine 7 pairs, reticulations conspicuous beneath, drying grey 3.5\u20145.75 in. long, 1.5 in. wide, petiole .1 in. long thick. Raceme about 6 in. long, fairly stout, puberulous. Flowers distant, .3 in. across, on pedicels .3 in. long puberulous. Calyx tube short puberulous, lobes oblong reflexed puberulous outside, glabrous inside. Stamens glabrous. Ovary dense pale, woolly, stalk very short.\n\n**KEDAH.** Lankawi; Gunong Rayah, (Mohamed Haniff).\n\nThis is allied to *C. gracilis*, Prain, but the leaves are lanceolate. The sepals, pedicels and rachis are pubescent, and the flowers are distinctly pedicelled.\n\n**ROSACEAE.**\n\n**Parastemon spicatum**, n. sp.\n\nA glabrous shrub. Leaves coriaceous, elliptic, abrupt caudate acuminate, blunt, base long narrowed, nerves 6 pairs, 2.5 to 2.75 in. long, 1 in. wide, petiole .15 in. long. Spike axillary 3.5 in. long shortly peduncled with many very small sessile flowers. Bracts linear oblong. Calyx tube short campanulate, interior pubescent. Petals 0. Stamens 2 glabrous, from the edge of the tube.\n\n**BORNEO.** Sarawak, Rejang, Sibu, (Haviland and C. Hose 3240); and 2 miles from Kuching (Haviland 723).\n\nThis species differs from the only other one, *P. urophylum*, in its being a shrub, (whereas the other is a large stout tree) and in its flowers being sessile.\n\n**Parinarium rubiginosum**, n. sp. *P. costatum* var. *rubiginosum*, Ridl. in Journ. F. M. S. Mus. iv. 143.\n\nA tree about 20 ft. tall, the branches rather thick and when young covered with velvety yellowish tomentum. Leaves stiffly coriaceous, ovate lanceolate, acuminate, base rounded, glabrous above, beneath pale reddish, woolly, nerves strongly elevated about 20 pairs, midrib strong beneath, depressed slightly above, 3.5\u20144 in. long, 1.25\u20141.75 in. wide, petiole red-woolly .2 in. long. Panicles .5 in. long densely red woolly. Flowers few hardly .2 in. long. Bracts ovate acute woolly and hairy on the back. Calyx tube funnel-shaped deep woolly red outside, densely villous with long hairs inside, teeth ovate acute. Petals a little longer white oblanceolate rounded, edges pubes-\ncent. Stamens much shorter than sepals glabrous. Style very short with the ovary densely villous. Stigma discoid.\n\n**Pahang.** Gunong Tahan in woods across the Teku (Ridley).\n\nThe indumentum and short racemes and more coriaceous leaves are so different in this plant from those of true *P. costatum* that I consider it advisable to separate it specifically, though it is certainly allied to that species.\n\n**Pygeum coriifolium**, n. sp.\n\nSmall tree, leaves coriaceous elliptic shortly blunt and acuminate, base very shortly narrowed, glabrous, nerves invisible above prominent beneath distant 5 pairs, midrib very prominent, reticulations invisible, 6 in. long 3.5 in. wide, petiole 5 in. long. Racemes solitary axillary .5 in. long, pedicels very short, puberulous. Calyx tube campanulate, pubescent, lobes 6 unequal, ovate acute pubescent, inside of tube glabrous. Petals 0. Stamens with filaments long, rather thick, 20. Style stout, shorter. Stigma clubbed, flattened, ovary short, globose, hairy.\n\n**Perak.** Temengoh and Kertai rivers; in forests (Ridley).\n\nAllied to *P. parviflorum*, Teysm. but the leaves are larger and rather more fleshy, with distant and fewer nerves. The raceme is almost a spike, solitary, very short.\n\n**SAXIFRAGACEAE.**\n\n**Polyosma grandis**, n. sp.\n\nA tree 40 to 50 feet tall with spreading branches. Stem 1.5\u20142 ft. through. Leaves membranous drying black, ovate elliptic, cuspidate, acuminate, base cuneate, margins denticulate, glabrous except the midrib and prominent 12 pairs of nerves beneath, secondary nerves nearly as prominent 6\u20147 in. long, 3\u20144 in. wide, petiole stout .5 long, flattened, pubescent. Raceme 6 in. long, peduncle 1 in. long, flattened, pubescent. Buds narrow cylindric blunt, pedicels .1 in. long, pubescent. Calyx-tube cylindric, lobes broad, ovate, acute as long as the tube. Petals subglabrous, narrow, linear, sparsely villos inside. Stamens shorter, filaments villous.\n\n**Perak.** Larut Hills at 3500 to 4000 ft. (*Kunstler 3802*). Flowers white, base greenish.\n\nThis plant was referred by King to *P. integrifolia*, Bl. but is clearly very distinct from that species and is most closely allied to *P. ilicifolia*, Bl. but from this it differs in its large size and very large ovate elliptic leaves and thick petals.\nPolyosma conocarpa, n. sp. *P. mutabilis*, King in part.\n\nTree 20\u201430 feet tall, young parts appressed, hairy. Leaves membranous, elliptic lanceolate, acuminate, long narrowed to base, quite entire, glabrous, nerves about 8 pairs, conspicuous beneath inarching well within the margin, 3.5\u20146 in. long 1.25\u20142 in. wide, petiole .2 in. long appressed and hairy when young. Raceme 5 in. long appressed hairy. Flowers white, scattered or in little groups; pedicels .1 in. in fruit .2 in. Calyx tube campanulate, hairy, teeth very small, subacute. Petals linear .2 in. long sparsely hairy outside, villous inside. Stamens nearly as long. Fruit conoid, truncate strongly 4-ribbed when dry, .25 in. across at base, narrowing upwards.\n\n**Singapore.** (Wallich 8472). Perak. Larut Hills (Kunstler), Birch\u2019s Hill (Wray). Kedah. Lankawi, Gunong Raya (Mohamed Haniff). Sumatra. Padang at Ayer Mantjur (Beccari 524). Forests up to 1000 ft. Flowers scented like privet.\n\nThis is quite different from Blume\u2019s *P. mutabilis* of Java in the fruit, which resembles that of *P. velutina*, Bl. as figured in Koorder\u2019s and Valentou\u2019s Boomsorten.\n\n**P. glaucescens**, n. sp.\n\nA small tree 20\u201430 feet tall, or shrub. Leaves elliptic to lanceolate acute, base narrowed, thick, coriaceous, glabrous beneath, nerves very obscure 3\u20143.5 in. long, 1.75 to 1.5 in. wide, petiole 1 in. long. Raceme pubescent 2.5\u20143 in. long. Flowers crowded .2 in. long. Buds oblong, dilate at base. Calyx very short funnel-shaped, lobes acute spreading, pubescent. Petals oblong, blunt, sparsely strigose outside, densely villous at tip inside. Stamens shorter.\n\n**Pahang.** Gunong Tahan (Robinson 5388, 5493; Ridley 16260): on the Padang and on Skeat\u2019s ridge (Ridley 16018, 16019).\n\nI originally referred this to varieties *intermedia* and *lanceolata* of King\u2019s *P. coriacea*, but on closely examining it conclude it to be specifically distinct not only in the foliage, the leaves being thicker with very inconspicuous nerves, and usually glaucous beneath, but with shorter, broader flowers less pubescent and dilate at the base. The leaves vary in form somewhat, perhaps according to the amount of exposure on these rocky ridges and growth of the plant.\n\n**P. fragrans**, Benn. Pl. Jav. Rar. 196; *Itea fragrans*, Wall. 8472.\n\nThe only plants of this I have seen are those collected by Wallich in Singapore (mixed unfortunately with *P. Wallichii* from Khasia distributed under the next number in many distributions by accident) and one which appears the same collected in Perak without locality by Scortechini. In Havi-\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 75, 1917.\nland's Sarawak collections are two plants I take to be this, though the flowers are rather smaller .15 in. long. Dr. Haviland notes \"Ovary 2-celled, 3 in one case, several ovuled.\"\n\nThey were obtained at Kuching (Haviland 944 and 1886).\n\nPolyosma velutina, Bl. Mus. Bot. Lugd. Bat. I. 261.\n\nTo this species King refers a plant which occurs in Perak at Goping and in Larut (Kunstler), the Dindingings, Bruas (Ridley) and in Penang on Penang Hill and at Balik Pulau (Curtis 1165) with bright yellowish green leaves, like those of P. laetevirens. He had not seen specimens of Blume's plant, nor have I seen types of Blume's plant. But I have not seen anything like King's species from Java; and the plant identified with P. velutina, Bl. by Koorders and Valeton (Boomsorten Pl. 195) and distributed as this plant No. 24404b is entirely different, and belongs to the section of Polyosma with membranous and black drying leaves. I conclude therefore that King's P. velutina cannot be Blume's plant and give the name of P. flavovirens to it. Blume's description of P. velutina is short; but the only species I have seen from Java with velvety leaves is the above mentioned plant from Koorders' collections and one from Zollinger No. 886: and these agree with Blume's description as far as it goes. It has membranous black drying leaves densely fuscous velvety beneath and curiously angled branches. The fruit is ovoid and .2 in. long in these specimens. Specimens collected at Kuching in Sarawak by Haviland (No. 2914) seem identical.\n\nPolyosma fasciculata, n. sp.\n\nLeaves sub-coriaceous, elliptic sparsely toothed along the edge, base blunt and shortly narrowed, tip subacute, quite glabrous, nerves 6 to 10 pairs branched at the tip, rather obscure and not elevate, 4\u20146 in. long thick. Spikes rather slender 6 in. long puberulous. Flowers numerous, .4 in. long, sessile, fascicled in groups of 2\u20144 or 5. Buds cylindric blunt very sparsely puberulous. Bracts hairy acute. Calyx tube very short sub-companulate, lobes ovate acute spreading. Petals rather broad in proportion to length, sparsely villous inside. Stamens a little shorter.\n\nKedah. Gunong Jerai (Ridley 5219).\n\nKing refers this dubiously to P. coriacea, King, but it seems to me in its small very sparsely hairy flowers much more nearly allied to P. Scortechnii a very little known plant which has however quite entire leaves and distinct pedicels to the flowers. The flowers in this species are not evenly scattered over the rachis, but clustered together in small lots.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nPolyosma pisocarpa, n. sp.\n\nStem pale not angled; young parts velvety hairy. Leaves stiffly coriaceous elliptic, acute or obovate blunt, nerves fine about 12 pairs very irregular faint on both sides, glabrous except at first the midrib slightly hairy, 3\u20144 in. long, 1.5\u20141.75 in. wide, petiole .5 in. long rather stout sometimes pubescent. Raceme 6\u20147 in. long dense many flowered pubescent. Flowers green, pedicels stout much longer than calyx, hairy. Calyx tube campanulate, lobes triangular acute. Petals .35 in. long sparingly pubescent linear subacute villous inside. Stamens distinctly shorter. Style very slender. Fruit pea-shaped globose, .2 in. long, glabrous \u201cblue\u201d on pedicels slender, glabrous, .2 in. long. Seed smooth globular.\n\nBorneo. Sarawak at Kuching and between it and Santubong (Haviland, 2911, 2912, 2913, 1464, 1988).\n\nThis species in nearest P. coriacea, King, but it has longer flowers on longer pedicels. The small pea-shaped blue fruit is peculiar. The raceme long and dense. The leaves as Haviland points out are of two forms, in one lanceolate and acuminate, in the other obovate and retuse, but there are more or less intermediate forms on the different specimens and in other respects the plants are the same.\n\nHAMAMELIDACEAE.\n\nRhodoleia ovalifolia, n. sp.\n\nA big shrub up to 10 feet tall with thick branches, the young parts densely red-hairy. Leaves, young lanceolate acute base acuminate, older 4 to 6 in. long 1.5 to 2 in. wide, rigidly coriaceous ovate with a rounded subcordate base, apex acute, at first red-scurfy beneath later becoming white-glaucous, nerves strongly elevate 6\u20148 pairs with some of the secondary nerves nearly as strongly elevate both nerves and reticulations depressed on the upper surface, 4\u20144.5 in. long, 2.5 in. wide, petiole at first densely velvety, later glabrous. Capitula solitary but often numerous axillary on the ends of the branches, one inch across. Peduncles thick decurved red, hairy. Bracts rounded, red, velvety, much larger than in R. Teysmanni. Petals narrow linear spatulate round at tip, .5 in. long, .1 in. wide, shorter than the stamens. Filaments .75 in. long, anthers oblong. Capsule .5 in. long, densely red-hairy.\n\nPahang. Gunong Tahan (Robinson, Ridley).\n\nThis is the third described species of the genus. One species Rhodoleia Championi of Hongkong, a shrub, has flowers as large as this, but the petals are much broader, and the plant is much more glabrous. R. Teysmanni of Sumatra and of the mountains of the Malay Peninsula is a tree. It is\nnearly glabrous, and the leaves are all lanceolate or oblong, capitula smaller, and fruit smaller all glabrous except a little pubescence on the bracts. *R. ovalifolia* is remarkable for the dense red velvety hair covering the shoots, peduncles, bracts and fruit. The leaves in Robinson's flowering specimens are much the shape of those of *R. Teysmanni* but more acuminate the nerves hardly more visible, but the midrib is red-scurfy. In the fruiting plants the leaves are quite different; they are remarkably coriaceous with the nerves depressed above and strongly elevate beneath. At first these leaves are red beneath with a deciduous red scurf; but this at last disappears and the leaves appear nearly white beneath. There is a certain amount of variation in the leaves of *R. Teysmanni* but nothing at all like this. The capitula densely red-hairy, are as big as those of *R. Championi* or nearly so but the petals are quite as narrow as those of *R. Teysmanni*.\n\n**SAMYDACEAE.**\n\n**Casearia albicans**, Wall.\n\nThere has been a considerable amount of confusion about this species which requires clearing up. In Wallich's Herbarium are three sheets of plants under the number 3197, labelled 3197, 3197.2, 3197.3. The only one labelled *C. albicans* is 3197.3 from Penang; and it appears to be *C. esculenta*, Roxb. No. 3197.2 from Singapore is in fruit, and seems also to be *C. esculenta*, No. 3197.3 from Penang, is identical with another plant No. 7432; and this is probably the plant described by King as *C. albicans*, Wallich. It has no name in Wallich's Herbarium, and is not the same as the plant so named by Wallich. It, therefore, being a distinct plant, requires a name. I call it **C. latifolia**. I have collected the plant myself on the side of the track to West Hill in Penang. What Clarke called *C. albicans* in the Flora of British India, King has already altered to *C. Clarkei*. No specimens of it occur at all in Wallich's Herbarium.\n\n**Casearia velutinosa**, n. sp.\n\nA shrub. Branches velvety, flexuous. Leaves thinly coriaceous, oblong to ovate, abruptly acuminate, base rounded or shortly narrowed, nerves 12 pairs ascending prominent beneath and depressed above, glabrous above, soft, tomentose beneath, 6\u201410 in. long, 3\u20144 in. wide, petiole tomentose .2 in. long. Glomeruli .15 in. across. Flowers .1 in. wide. Sepals 5, imbricate, pubescent, suborbicular oblong, hairy outside. Petals 0. Stamens 10, glabrous, anthers small, forming a tube with the spathulate oblong hairy staminodes. Ovary conic, glabrous. Stigma large, capitate.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nPerak. Gunong Keledang (Ridley). Dindings. Lumut and Bruas (Ridley).\n\nAllied to *C. latifolia*, Ridl., but differing in the very tomentose branches, backs of leaves and petioles.\n\n**Homalium spathulatum**, n. sp.\n\nA glabrous tree. Leaves thinly coriaceous, elliptic acuminate, tip blunt, base narrowed, entire or undulate on the edge; nerves about 7 pairs, very fine and rather obscure, as are the reticulations, shining, 4 in. long, 1.5 in. wide; petiole .2 in. long. Racemes axillary, simple, 3 in. long, tomentose, slender. Flowers numerous, not clustered, subsessile .2 in. across. Calyx-tube funnel-shaped, tomentose .1 in. long; lobes very narrow linear, 10, edged with long white hairs. Petals 10, a little longer, linear spatulate. Stamens shorter, 2 opposite each petal. Glands villous. Styles 3, glabrous.\n\nDindings. Pangkor (Curtis 1370).\n\nThis differs from *H. myrianthum*, Bak. in Kew Bull. 1896, p. 23, of Sandakan in the panicled racemes, funnel-shaped calyx and nearly sessile flowers.\n\n**BEGONIACEAE.**\n\n**Begonia phoeniogramma**, n. sp. *B. paupercula*, Ridl. in Journ. Roy. As. Soc. Straits Branch, 54, p. 42, not of King.\n\nThis little plant I find, on seeing the co-type of King\u2019s *B. paupercula* in Herb. Kew, is not the species he intended, I therefore give it the above name which refers to the red stripes on the small flowers. It was formerly very common on the path leading up to the Batu Caves, Selangor; but at my last visit I noticed that it had become scarce owing to a series of steps having been made up the slope where it grew. I have seen it nowhere else.\n\n**Begonia tricornis**, n. sp. *B. Roxburghii*, Ridl. in Journ. Fed. Malay States Mus. iv. 20, not of DC. This plant is really more near allied to *B. inflata*, Clarke, of the Himalayas, but is distinct from all species of the section. It is the only one in the Malay Peninsula of the section *Casparya*, (with pulpy 3-angled not winged green fruit).\n\n**Begonia longicaulis**, n. sp.\n\nStem elongated, red, with internodes 2.5 in. long, glabrous. Leaves ovate cuspidate, base deeply cordate, very unequal, 3 in. long, 2.5 in. wide; petiole 4\u20146 in. long. Stipules persistent, oblong with a terminal setiform process, 1.1 in. long, .2 in. wide. Peduncle 6 in. long, with 2 terminal flowers on\npeduncles 1 in. long. Flowers pinkish-white. Sepals of male flowers broad ovate rounded, .75 in. long and as wide; petals oblong-lanceolate, blunt, .3 in. wide. Stamens in a globose head on a short stalk.\n\nPerak. Gunong Kerban (Robinson). Pahang. Gunong Tahan (Ridley).\n\nThis plant is rather puzzling. It seems closely allied to *B. venusta*, King, with which species it occurred; but instead of having a creeping rhizome with leaves and peduncles arising directly from it, it has long erect stems with long internodes and large stipules with a long-setaceous point. In this, except for the form of the stipules which have no seta, it resembles *B. megaptera*. I cannot distinguish King\u2019s *B. megapteroidea* from *B. venusta*. Is it possible that this plant sometimes develops a caulescent stem, and that it is a form or state of *B. venusta*? The specimens are neither very complete.\n\n**Begonia eiromischa**, n. sp.\n\nRhizome short, stout. Leaves fleshy, obliquely reniform peltate, acuminate, dark green, glabrous 3\u20143.5 in. long and as wide, nerves 7: petiole 2\u20143 in. long, with dense thick red wool. Peduncles glabrous, red, about 5 in. long. Flowers on two branches, small, .5 in. across, rose pink. Male sepals 2, broad, orbicular, rounded. Petals very narrow, linear. Style of female flower trifid; branches bifid. Capsule .6 in. long lateral wings very short, posterior rather thin, broad, oblong, rounded .3 in. long and as wide.\n\nPenang. Pulau Butong (Curtis 1028).\n\nI have seen specimens of this and a good coloured drawing made in the Penang Gardens. It is undoubtedly near *B. Hasskarli* but differs conspicuously in the woolly stalk of the leaf. In the drawing the fruits are figured as equally 3 angled and bright red; perhaps they were not ripe when drawn.\n\n**Begonia rhoephila**, n. sp.\n\nRhizome stout, creeping, 1 in. long. Leaves nearly or quite glabrous, lanceolate, erect, caudate-acuminate, base decurrent on the petiole, sparsely distantly toothed, apex closely toothed, nerves 4 pairs, often hairy on the underside, midrib always hairy with appressed hairs, 5\u20146 in. wide, petiole 1.5\u20144 in. long, glabrous or hairy. Peduncle 1\u20142 in. long in flower, stouter and up to 12 in. in fruit, glabrous. Flowers few, short pedicelled white tinted on the back or all pink. Sepals of the male flower oblong-ovate, .3 in. long, .2 in. wide. Petals narrower, oblong. Stamens numerous, anthers oblong, apiculate as long as the free filaments. Female flowers 5-petalled.\nCapsule 1.1 in. across, .5 in. long; lateral wings blunt, triangular; posterior .75 in. long, .3 in. wide, oblong rounded, thick ribbed.\n\nSelangor. Ulu Gombak, on rocks in the stream (Ridley).\n\nThis belongs to the jungle stream set of Begonias with narrow lanceolate leaves hardly or not lobed or unequal at the base, viz. B. Kunstleriana (B. Scortechinii) and B. perakensis, King. The latter has the leaves rounded. The former has them narrowed but not decurrent on the petiole as in rhoephila and very hairy. I take B. Scortechinii, King, of unknown locality to be a narrow leaved form of B. Kunstleriana.\n\nARALIACEAE.\n\nSchefflera, Forst. This genus was made by Forster for two species of plants, one from New Zealand and the other from Fiji. Later the genus Heptapleurum was founded by Gaertner, to which a considerable number of Asiatic species were attributed. The difference between the two genera is however, too slight to warrant their being kept distinct and Harms in the Pflanzenfamilien has placed the Heptapleurums under the earlier name Schefflera, in which I follow him, excluding however, the genus Brassaia which appears to me sufficiently distinct. It may however, be found necessary to separate from Schefflera such abnormal plants as S. (H.) Wrayi, with racemose not umbellate flowers; and I am rather dubious of the following new species which has the number of stamens double that of the perianth lobes and ovary cells.\n\nSchefflera polyandra, n. sp.\n\nLeaves digitate; petiole 9 in. long; leaflets 5, oblanceolate or oblong lanceolate acuminate, blunt, base narrowed, edge serrate, coriaceous, glabrous, smooth, nerves 7 pairs faint, reticulations faintly visible beneath, 4\u20146 in. long, 1.25 to 1.75 in. wide, petiolule 1.3 in. long. Panicle 5 in. long, branchlets .5 in. long, umbels of 4\u20145 flowers; pedicels .2 in. long, stout. Calyx campanulate, edge thin, truncate, entire .1 in. long. Petals shorter, ovate, 5. Stamens 14 to 16; anther as long as filament. Style conic, cylindric. Ovary 8-celled.\n\nPerak. Gunong Keledang (Ridley 9763).\n\nArthrophyllum pinnatum, Clarke. Under this name in King's Materials two plants have been combined, one the true A. pinnatum of the Penang Hills. The other a smaller plant with many more smaller leaflets and smaller flowers, A. alternifolium Maingay, MS. a native of Mt. Ophir.\nArthrophyllum lancifolium, n. sp.\n\nTree. Branchlets slender, angled, yellow, glabrous. Leaves coriaceous, lanceolate caudate at the tip, acuminate at both ends, edge crenulate, undulate, midrib winged on both sides, nerves and reticulations fine, 3\u20143.5 in. long, 1\u20141.5 in. wide; petiole 1\u20142 in. long only .3 in.; uppermost leaves jointed with the stem. Umbels 4\u20145, on short pedicels .4 in. long. Flowers 10\u201413 in an umbel, .05 in. long. Calyx short campanulate; limb undulate, not toothed.

Strickland, M.A., B.C.\nTravelling Medical Entomologist, F. M. S.\n\nDuring a recent visit to the Gap, on the Selangor-Pahang boundary, which is at 2,800 feet, I observed a curious and interesting fact in the life of mosquito which seems worthy of record.\n\nThis mosquito, kindly identified for me by Dr. Stanton as Chaetomyia (Leicesteria) flava, Leicester, which had been caught in the resthouse and was kept in a test-tube, was observed to have attached to a hind-leg a mass which until closer examination, seemed to be one of those Ceratopogon which have a habit of attaching themselves to mosquitoes to suck out their body-juices. On examination however with a microscope it proved to be an ova-mass, and what was very interesting, from each ovum the head of a young larva was sticking out, the whole thing looking like a miniature nest of young sparrows.\n\nThe mosquito was introduced to a bottle in which was some water, when it immediately flew down to the water and dipped its hind-leg methodically into it. Immediately all the larvae came out of the ova-mass and swam away as livelily as a crowd of children coming out of school on a holiday.\n\nOn two occasions I observed this phenomenon and on another I caught a specimen of the mosquito with the ova-mass on its leg from which all the larvae had gone.\n\nI think it seems clear that the mosquito ovideposits on its own leg and that the phenomenon represents a device by which the mosquito is enabled to deposit its larvae in collections of water which are inaccessible to it for ordinary deposition; perhaps in bamboos, or in the leafy axils of plants like common kladi or pig-lily,1 or it may be to save the eggs from some danger which they might incur if they were laid on water.\n\nI am much indebted to Mr. de la Mare Norris of the Agricultural Department, F. M. S., for the drawing which is given.\n\n---\n\n1.

Burkill.\n\nThe Elaeocarps are abundant in the Malay Peninsula and are on the whole very much of one type: to this type Elaeocarpus Barnardii in general conforms.\n\nIt occurs close to Taiping at low elevations; and it is there known by the name Jiha. It is a tree with reddish chestnut bark on the branches, and with relatively small somewhat crowded obovate bright green smooth leaves, the margins of which are slightly and distantly toothed. The flowers are of average size, and, as is always the case in the genus, face earthwards along horizontal racemes. The fruits are of a deep blue.\n\nThe affinity seems to be to Elaeocarpus cuneatus, Wight, a widely spread tree of India, which southwards reaches Tenasserim.\n\nElaeocarpus Barnardii, inter Diceras E. cuneato, Wight, affinis: differt praecipue ovario et putamine.\n\nArbor, ramorum cortice castaneo vel rufo-castaneo.

The Seedling of Anisoptera costata, Korth.\n\nBy I. H. Burkill.\n\nFig. 1. Flower seen from below, \u00d7 2\u00bd.\n\nIt is proposed to clear the way for a general review of the Malayan Dipterocarps by a series of short papers, of which this is the first. It deals with the seedling of Anisoptera costata, Korthals.\n\nAnisoptera costata is a tall forest tree wild in the Botanic Gardens, Singapore, where two individuals flowered freely at the commencement of April, 1916, producing with new foliage, panicles of pendent white flowers from the ends of the branches. The shape of the flower is given above (fig. 1): the corolla does not fall.\n\nThe seeds from this flowering ripened about the end of June: and when they fell, a leaf-fall occurred, followed by a more abundant production of new leaves than had been the case when the flowers appeared.\n\nThe seeds germinated at once, lying on the ground. In germination the radicle is extruded, curves earthwards, and anchors itself; then the cotyledons are pulled out of the capsule by the straightening of the hypocotyl. The process is seen in progress in Figs. 2 and 5 below.\n\nJour. Straits Branch R. A. Soc., No. 75, 1917.\nFig. 2. Seedling at the time when the cotyledons have just been withdrawn from the capsule. l.cot., larger cotyledon; sm. cot., lesser cotyledon.\n\nThe figures show how unequal are the two cotyledons: the larger is markedly four-ridged on the back (figs. 2, 3, and 5): the lesser is only obscurely four-ridged and is sagittate-reniform in outline. This inequality though very evident in Anisoptera, is yet greater in some other genera of the order, e.g. Dryobalanops.\n\nDuring germination the petiole of the cotyledons elongates only a little. Brandis and Gilg, in Engler\u2019s Pflanzenfamilien, III. 6, (1895) p. 242, from very imperfect knowledge stated that great elongation is a character of the order, an error due to familiarity with the genus Dipterocarpus, where it occurs, and want of knowledge of other genera.\n\nIn several if not all of the species of Dipterocarpus, the cotyledons do not function as green leaves in the nourishment of the seedling and are not drawn out of the capsule. But in Anisoptera costata as well as in other genera the seedlings are greatly injured, if the withdrawing is prevented, or if they do not reach the light: for instance if the capsules are buried under the surface of the ground, so that the cotyledons are imprisoned, the seedlings in Anisoptera either die or languish; while the seedlings of Shorea, of several species at least, under the same circumstances die.\n\nThe cotyledons when they have been freed, and as the hypocotyl completes its straightening, part and come to stand more or less horizontally (fig. 6). Then from between them, the shoot pushes out and bears four leaves in a whorl. These leaves are to be seen in figure 3 with their faces folded together. The fifth leaf and all\nwhich follow are solitary. The four leaves of the whorl were fully developed in September, i.e. at three months and the fifth leaf generally in December or January, i.e. at six months.\n\nIt is of particular interest that among the four leaves, inequality is found, that two are commonly larger than the others,\u2014two which are not opposite, but contiguous, being those over the lesser cotyledon (fig. 6). The inequality is already obvious before the leaf-blades have expanded, and persists through life (figs. 7, and 8); but is sometimes very slight (figs. 9 and 10).\n\nFig. 5. The seedling as the cotyledons separate, seen obliquely from above: l. cot. larger cotyledon; sm. cot. lesser cotyledon.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 75, 1917.\n\nFig. 6. Seedling as the leaves of the whorl separate, seen from above: l. pair, larger pair of leaves.\nThe inequality of the cotyledons is apparently connected with the way in which they are packed in the seed. A compromise has been made in them there between fleshiness for the storage of food, and surface for assimilation later, resulting in extension beyond the diameter of the seed and in a rolling of the embryo on itself which places one cotyledon outside the other; and probably therefrom comes their inequality; but why the inequality should be repeated in the whorl which succeeds the cotyledons is not evident. Shoreas have\n\nFig. 7. above. The whorl of leaves expanded, showing the inequality: l. pair, the larger pair; and\n\nFig. 8. below. The whorl and the fifth leaf, seen from above.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nmore simple equal cotyledons and the first two leaves are equal. *Shorea* cotyledons are sagittately bilobed, and the first leaves are paired; but *Anisoptera* cotyledons are four ridged, and the first leaves are in a whorl of four. In both genera with the next leaf, the alternate condition sets in which persists through life.\n\nThere is no important difference in the microscopic structure of the petiole of a leaf of the whorl and of the fifth leaf: both in section about the middle exhibit (see fig. 11) a ring of normal cortex enclosing a ring of sclerenchyma within which is phloem and xylem, and an included bundle with the xylem towards the face of the leaf as drawn. Associated with the largest xylem vessels are resin ducts to the number of five. Close under the blade,\n\n---\n\n**Figs. 9 and 10.** Two cases in which the leaves of the whorl differed from each other in very little.\n\n**Fig. 11.** Petiole in transverse section. *Scler.*, sclerenchyma; and *r. Canal*, resin canal.\n\n*R. A. Soc., No. 75, 1917.*\nthrough that part of the petiole which is a pulvinus, the sclerenchyma is wanting, while the ring of bundles is a little irregular and the cortex is thicker. Such changes are of course connected with the mobility required of the pulvinus: they take place in the petioles of the whorl in the same way as in the fifth leaf. And there is nothing further peculiar about these whorled leaves beyond the circumstances of their association and their inequality.\n\nCompared with the adult leaves, they are of course much smaller, up to 8.2 cm. long by 4.1 cm. wide, and the vascular elements in the petiole, etc., in the large leaves are altered by the increased number of groups of larger xylem vessels in the ring, and by the space within this ring being completely occupied by a complex of bundles with much sclerenchyma. At the pulvinus the sclerenchyma is interrupted, and the ring somewhat irregularly broken up. But beyond the pulvinus, in the midrib of the leaf, the included bundles form up into orderly lines in concentric semicircles, which get less in numbers of their parts until near the tip of the leaf a condition is reached closely resembling the condition found in the petiole of the seedling leaves.\n\nBrandis (in Journ. Linn. Soc. Bot. xxxi, 1895, p. 20) suggested sectioning the pulvinus for the study of generic characters; but the middle of the petiole promises more.\nSome Rare Words.\n\nKutaha; nakas; turap; teterapan; kop; biram; ganteh;\nSeri Menanti.\n\nBy R. O. Winstedt.\n\nKUTAHA. In the Hikayat Raja-raja Pasai (No. 66, March, 1914, of this Journal) there occurs a word \u0643\u062a\u0627\u0647 several times (pp. 30, 35, 39, 41). Obviously from the contexts it is an interrogative particle. Mr. Mead romanized it wrongly k\u0113tah: it is found fully pointed in vowels\u2014kutaha\u2014in one of the 6 old Malay MSS. in the Cambridge University Library; vide p. 38 of Dr. Ph. S. van Ronkel\u2019s \u2018Account\u2019 of those MSS. in the \u201cBijdragen tot de Taal- Land- en Volkenkunde van N. I. 6e Vol. II.\u201d \u201cBriefly\u201d he observes, \u201cafter apa, mana, and adakah, this interrogative is seldom wanting,\u201d in those MSS. He suggests it may be compared with the Sundanese kutan.\n\nNAKAS. On p. 31 of Mr. Mead\u2019s transliteration of the same work there occurs a word \u0646\u0643\u0633; m\u0113ng\u0113nakan sangga nakas b\u0113p\u0113rmata. This word occurs also in a passage from the Bustanu\u2019s-salatin quoted by a Javanese scholar, Raden Dr. Hoesein Djajadingrat on p. 570 of the \u201cTijdschrift van het Bataviaasch Genootschap, deel LVII, afl. 6.\u201d Batu puteh di-ukir p\u0113lbagai warna dan nakas dan s\u0113limpat dan t\u0113mbosa dan mega aruk-arakan. Klinkert gives it as \u0646\u0643\u0633. It is possibly a motive in art,\u2014where figures face one another perhaps: and derived from the Arabic naks.\n\nTURAP. In Perak painted wicker-work panelling for houses is called t\u0113pas b\u0113rturap. In Achinese turab means to do masonry. Turap occurs several times in the aforesaid passage from the Bustanu\u2019s-salatin:\u2014di-sisi gunong itu kandang baginda dan dewal kandang itu di-turap d\u0113ngan batu puteh:\u2026\u2026..saphon nyiur gading b\u0113rgil\u0101r S\u0113rbat Jinuri di-tambak d\u0113ngan batu b\u0113rturap d\u0113ngan kapur:\u2026\u2026..jambangan batu b\u0113rturap. In one passage a variant MS. gives di-t\u0113rapi for di-turap; and in the same context as the above sentences occurs dan ada-lah dewal yang di-dalam itu b\u0113rt\u0113t\u0113rapan batu puteh\n\nJour.

There is also a k\u00e9r\u00eds t\u00e9terapan, which Wilkinson translates \u2018a creese with a groove running up the blade\u2019: but k\u00e9r\u00eds t\u00e9rapang means \u2018a creese with a sheath covered with metal,\u2019 and in Achinese t\u00e9terapan is \u2018a metal envelope.\u2019 Wilkinson is certainly right in his explanation of turap, which must mean \u2018to dress, plaster, line.\u2019 His Dictionary says, \u201cCovering; plastering; lining; giving a surface (of a different material) to anything, as a coat is lined or as a table is covered with green baize:\u201d\u2014I cannot state the authority for his instances. And perhaps t\u00e9terapan is connected with turap.\n\nKop \u2018the cupola of the howdah of an elephant; Hikayat Marong Mahawangsa Wilkinson. In Achinese khob means \u201cto cover with a dome, a cupola.\u201d And the same passage from the Bustanu\u2019s-salatin has dan pintu-nya m\u00ebngadap ka-istana, dan p\u00e9rbuat\u00e1n pintu-nya itu b\u00e9rkop; di-atas kop itu batu di-p\u00e9rbuat saperti biram b\u00e9rk\u00e9lokap dan b\u00e9rk\u00e9munchakkan dari-pada sangga p\u00eblinggam.\u201d Kop means any kind of \u2018dome, cupola.\u2019\n\nBiram. Wilkinson gives this word as meaning only \u2018elephant.\u2019 In the passage quoted under kop, it means \u2018a mythical snake with a head at both ends,\u2014a meaning it bears also in Achinese; a ring in the form of such a snake being called unchi\u00e9n tumpa biram. This meaning of the words explains chinchin patah biram, a Malay \u2018puzzle-ring\u2019\u2014vide p. 89 \u201cCircumstances of Malay Life\u201d by myself.\n\nGanteh. In the folk-tales of S\u00ebri Rama and Awang Sulong occurs the lines\n\nAnjong perak, g\u00ebmala ganti\nB\u00ebratap tila b\u00ebrdinding kacha.\n\nFor ganti we should read ganteh, which means, \u2018thick in the centre, of pillars; barrel-shaped; round.\u2019 On p. 46 of Mr. Wilkinson\u2019s S\u00ebri M\u00ebnanti occurs k\u00ebrbau bungkal ganteh ia-itu bulat ujong tandok-nya, kadang-kadang jatoh bungkal-nya t\u00ebtapi b\u00ebrganti balek (App. B. 5) and on p. 47 Mungkal ganteh tiang tangga k\u00ebchil di-atas di-bawah. These two quotations corroborate the meaning given, except that kadang-kadang jatoh bungkal-nya t\u00ebtapi b\u00ebrganti balek has been added by some Malay philologist, to whom the real meaning of ganteh was unknown.\n\nS\u00ebri Menanti. The name of the seat of H. H. the Yamtuan of Negri Sembilan is explained by Malays as a place where the early settlers found rice of the kind called s\u00ebri awaiting them. I would suggest that it is more probable it is a name reminiscent of s\u00ebri m\u00ebnganti (= m\u00ebnanti) the \u2018waiting-hall\u2019 in the palace of Javanese princes.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nThe Malay Rice Cycle.\n\nBy R. O. Winstedt.\n\nIn Kedah there is a phrase b\u00ebrt\u00ebmu kop for the \u2018completion of a cycle of years.\u2019 It is pretty certain that kop is derived through the Siamese kab from the Pali kappa, which in turn is the Sanskrit kalpa. It is used by Hindus and Buddhists to express an aeon during which the physical universe is destroyed. In Malay, it is applied to a cycle of a few years, generally to the 12 year cycle of the rice pawang, the years of which are designated by animal names. The cycle is common to Siamese, Cambodians, Chinese and Japanese. But both the word kop and the Malay names for the animals are from the Siamese and not from the Cambodian. The Cambodian form is kalba = kalpa, and the Cambodian words for the animals are more remote from the Malay words, while the Siamese words are almost identical:\n\n| Malay | Siamese | Cambodian |\n|-------|---------|-----------|\n| chuat | chuot   | chut      |\n| chalu | chal\u00fa   | chhlou    |\n| kan   | kh\u00e1n    | khal      |\n| tau   | tho     | thoh      |\n| marong| mar\u00f3ng  | roung     |\n| maseng| mas\u00e9ng  | m\u00ebsa\u00f1     |\n| mami\u00e0 | mami\u00e4   | momi      |\n| mameh | mam\u00e4    | mom\u00ea      |\n| wauk | w\u00f2k     | woc       |\n| raku | rak\u00e1    | rok\u00e1      |\n| chaw | cho     | cha       |\n| kun  | kun     | kor       |\n\nThe cycle is not known to the Mons.\n\nThis settles the problem discussed by Mr. Shaw on p. 7 of his paper on \u2018Rice Planting.\u2019 The linguistic evidence proves conclusively that the cycle was borrowed directly from the Siamese, who in turn may have borrowed from the Cambodians.\nThe Teaching of Malay in Europe.\n\nBy R. O. Winstedt.\n\nIt is commonly held that the best place to learn an Oriental language is in the country where it is spoken. To that facile contention Sir Charles Lyall gave an admirably considered answer in a memorandum addressed to the committee appointed in 1907 to consider the organisation of oriental studies in London. \"In the first place, it is not the view which has dictated the establishment of the flourishing schools established by our commercial rivals in Germany and France. These nations have been quick to perceive the advantages of providing, in their own country, centres where persons intending to make a career for themselves in Asia may prepare themselves for their task; and, so far as Germany is concerned, it is generally admitted that they have been strikingly successful. In trade, it is found that German agents, owing to their knowledge of the languages and the habits and customs of the East gained at home, are liable to outstrip their English competitors even in our own dominions. The amount of trade which is carried on between India and the nations of continental Europe is immense and growing; and in this expansion it is scarcely open to doubt that the Germans owe much of their advantage to the training which they receive in Oriental methods in their own country. Secondly, much time is lost by persons, who defer until they land in the East the commencement of the study of Oriental subjects. Europeans require, in order to overcome the initial difficulties presented by Oriental languages, the guidance and assistance of Europeans who have already encountered and surmounted those difficulties. The genius of Oriental speech is so different from that of European languages that a student, if left to his unassisted efforts, is likely to waste both time and labour in approaching his task. Moreover, so far as my experience goes, the art of teaching is little understood in the East. The ordinary munshi of India, at any rate, does not understand how his pupil's intelligence should be directed or stimulated, on what points stress should be laid, how differences of idiom between the two languages should be explained and other like matters which make the difference between good teaching and bad.\" And then Sir Charles Lyall goes on to lay stress upon the personal influence of a European teacher as compared with a munshi; and again, on the value of European libraries with their stores of comparative literature. Every one of his points is corroborated by our experience in the Malay Peninsula.\nBefore the same committee the late Lord Cromer expressed the view that almost as important as instruction in language is instruction in \"Oriental history, in religion, in all the social customs and the things that cluster round religion.\"\n\nThe result of the recommendations of the committee was the establishment of the School of Oriental Studies at Finsbury Circus, which was opened by His Majesty the King-Emperor in February (1917). On the faculty is a Lecturer in Malay, and Mr. C. O. Blagden, late of the Straits Settlements Civil Service, has been appointed first Lecturer.\n\nThe Report of the Committee has been published as an official blue-book and affords very profitable reading to all interested in Oriental languages. Sir Frank Swettenham is quoted as favouring preliminary training in England for six months or a year for cadets in our civil service. Sir Cecil Clementi Smith, also gave evidence, especially on the study of Chinese. Mr. Addis, joint manager of the Hongkong and Shangkai Bank gave evidence of the value of Chinese in commercial circles and the rarity of the self-denial required to master the drudgery of learning it in men once launched on business careers abroad. Mr. Ray writes a memorandum on the study of Melanesian languages.\n\nThe Report gives brief accounts of the instruction provided in Malay at Paris and Leiden.\n\nMr. Blagden has published the curriculum at Paris in Journal 50 of September 1908, and I have nothing to add to his account, except that the Pancha-Tandaran and Ch\u00e9rita J\u00e9naka are now text-books, for pupils in their first year and that 'Papers on Malay Subjects,' Skeat's 'Magic,' Wilkinson's 'Dictionary' and my own 'Malay Grammar' are books consulted. In 1906-1907 there were 24 regular students of Malay at the \u00c9cole Sp\u00e9ciale des Langues Orientales Vivantes.\n\nAt Leiden are taught (a) a general knowledge of the Indonesian languages, (b) Malay, (c) Javanese, (d) Old Javanese, (e) Sundanese, (f) Madurese, (g) Minangkabau (h) Batak. Synoptical lessons are given in history, religion, geography and ethnography, especially for students destined for the Dutch colonial civil service. The courses in Malay are designed for\n\n(i) candidates for the administrative civil service of the Dutch East Indies\n(ii) doctors of law who desire to become magistrates in the Dutch East Indies\n(iii) candidates for the degree of Doctor of Languages and Literatures of the East Indian Archipelago.\n\nFor students in groups (i) and (ii) a practical knowledge of Malay is the aim of the course; for students in (iii) a more profound comparative study of Malay and the general linguistics of the Indian Archipelago.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 75, 1917.\nThe School of Oriental Studies in London is designed \"to give instruction in the languages of Eastern and African peoples, Ancient and Modern, and in the Literature, History, Religion and Customs of those peoples, especially with a view to the needs of persons about to proceed to the East or to Africa for the pursuit of study and research, commerce or a profession.\" Special inter-collegiate arrangements with the London School of Economics will be made for instruction in the sociology and anthropology of the less civilized races. Inter-collegiate arrangements will also be made for instruction in phonetics; and modern phonetic methods will be used to facilitate the acquirement of correct pronunciation.\n\nIt is to be hoped that large local commercial firms and estates will recognise the value of preliminary instruction in Malay for young men embarking on careers in the Malay Peninsula; a value fully recognised by prominent business men acquainted with colonial needs. Cadets, too, might well spend the few months they pass in England between their selection for the service and their departure for the East in attending the School. For such students elementary practical teaching is provided. I had the pleasure of reading Mr. Blagden's opening lecture and can attest its illuminating simplicity. But, it is hoped that an advanced course also may be wanted. The library, the comparative method of teaching, the lectures on Arabic and Sanskrit at the same School would all be profitable to any man, on leave in London, who might desire to perfect his knowledge of Malay linguistics, literature and history. Sanskrit and Pali and India must always be to us what Malay and Javanese and the Dutch Indies are to Holland; but it is high time that some of us at least should get to know the best that is written about things Malayan, to recognise that there is a best, a standard of scholarship, in Malay studies. For those, who have that ambition, I can say confidently that a course of the lectures provided will dispel the hallowed notion that the highest authority on Malay matters is a kampong elder.\nCONTENTS.\n\nPROCEEDINGS.\n\nProceedings of the Annual General Meeting ........................................... v.\nAddress, at the Annual General Meeting, by Mr. H.

Argyll Campbell.\n\nIntroduction.\n\nThis research was undertaken in order to supply the local medical students with necessary information. Up to a short time ago the physiology of diet, nutrition and excretion which was placed before these students, was that of an European. The facts and figures which hold for an European are far from the truth when applied to an Asiatic. The results published in this paper have been obtained during the six months from October, 1916, to March, 1917, and although they are not considered to be more than an introduction to the subject they do form a basis to work upon when dealing with local Asiatic patients, whereas the European figures are certainly misleading. It is the intention of the author to continue this research for an indefinite period employing representatives of all classes and of all races of the community. These results apply to individuals leading sedentary lives similar to that of a medical student.\n\nTechnique.\n\nThere are Tamils, Malays, Chinese, Brahmins and Eurasians at the Medical School. One Tamil, one Chinese, and one Brahmin representative have been under observation every Monday, Wednesday and Friday for six months. A Malay has been employed for only two weeks. He partakes of the same diet as the Tamil. His results although few in number are interesting in that they confirm the results obtained from the Tamil. Results obtained at random from many other medical students confirm the results obtained from the students who have been under observation for six months.\n\nThe Tamil and Malay representatives live in the school hostel. The Chinese and the Brahmin live in their own homes. The Chinese, Brahmin and Tamil are senior students and rank amongst the most successful at the school. They have been demonstrators and class assistants for over a year. The author is indebted to them for their faithful co-operation.\n\nJour. Straits Branch R. A. Soc., No. 76, 1917.\nIn all cases the food eaten is that of the student\u2019s choice. The daily diet varies slightly in quality. It does vary considerably in quantity. The food was weighed just before it was eaten. The compositions of the foods and their heat values have been taken from standard books on the subject (1).\n\nFor estimations of the kidney excretions care was taken to preserve the twenty-four hour specimens by the addition of 2 c.c. of a 5 per cent. solution of Thymol in chloroform. This is a matter of importance to doctors in Malaya. Ammoniacal fermentation proceeds very rapidly in this climate if the preservative is not added. The methods of quantitative analyses employed are those described by Cramer (2). Some of these methods are not as accurate as they might be, but they are employed in most hospitals because the results obtained are quite accurate enough from a clinical point of view.\n\nOn one or two occasions one or other of the representatives was indisposed for a day or two. No observations were made until health was restored.\n\n**Diet and Nutrition.**\n\n**Chinese.**\u2014The maximum diet taken by the Chinese in twenty-four hours gives a heat value of 2131 kilocalories. It consists of bread 45 grammes, condensed milk 42, boiled rice 798, flour 128, pork 77, chicken 32, fish 50, cabbage 10, bananas 112. His minimum diet for twenty-four hours gives a heat value of 1141 kilocalories. It consists of boiled rice 524 grammes, egg 40, pork 37, beans 14, chicken 51, flour 53, fish 21, cabbage 14, gruel 65. His average diet for six months consists of protein 60 grammes, fat 43, carbohydrate 227, which gives 1577 kilocalories (Table II). This student weighs 92 lbs. and is 20 years of age. He has lost a small amount of weight during the experiment. Examination of his kidney excretion shows that he metabolises 57.8 grammes of the protein eaten, so that he uses most of the food he eats.\n\n**Tamil.**\u2014The maximum diet taken by the Tamil in 24 hours gives 1847 kilocalories, his minimum diet 1519. The former consists of bread 116 grammes, butter 14, bananas 112, cake 112, cocoa 14, beef 21, mutton 98, boiled rice 448, egg 70, sugar 14. The minimum diet consists of bread 120 grammes, butter 6, bananas 67, fish 118, beans 154, boiled rice 504, cake 56, eggs 90, sugar 14, cocoa 14. This student lived on this diet for six months, but estimations were made during three months of this period. The average diet for the three months gives 1672 kilocalories and contains 58 grammes of protein, 32 of fat and 277 of carbohydrate (Table II). The examination of his kidney excretion shows that he metabolises 51.5 grammes of protein, so that he does not use all of the food he eats. He is 26 years of age and weighs 143 lbs.\n\n**Malay.**\u2014This student partook of the same diet as the Tamil\u2019s for six months. He has only been under observation for two weeks.\nHis average diet for this period contains 57 grammes of protein, 31 of fat and 239 of carbohydrate, the heat value being 1502 kilocalories (Table II). His kidney excretion shows that he metabolises 50 grammes of the protein of his food. He weighs 125 lbs. and is 18 years of age. His religion does not allow him to eat pork otherwise he has a free choice.\n\nBrahmin.\u2014The maximum diet taken by this student gives 2922 kilocalories, the minimum 2175. The maximum diet consists of wheat 96 grammes, lentils 107, rice (weighed uncooked) 350, butter 76, sugar 14, milk 448; the minimum diet consists of wheat 63 grammes, onions 49, butter 90, beans 126, lentils 140, rice 198, sugar 14, milk 336. The average diet contains 83 grammes of protein, 68 of fat and 371 of carbohydrate (Table II). Judging from his kidney excretion this student metabolises only half of his protein food, namely 41.5 grammes. The other half is simply wasted. It is well known that many vegetarians partake of such bulky and indigestible foods that absorption is interfered with. This student is a strict vegetarian; Brahmins are not allowed to take any animal food except milk. His average daily diet has a heat value of 2493 (Table II) but it is evident that he uses a good deal less than this since only half of the protein food is actually used by his body. He weighs 110 lbs. and is 21 years of age. He has not altered appreciably in weight during the six months of observation.\n\nKidney Excretions.\n\nAmmonia.\u2014The total acidity of the urine cannot be accurately determined, but if the urine be neutralised by adding $\\frac{N}{10}$ alkali, some indication can be obtained regarding the acidity. Since the figure thus obtained is of no known clinical importance no more need be said about it. After neutralising the urine as above, neutral formaldehyde is added. Owing to the liberation of acid which takes place when the formaldehyde has combined with ammonia, the urine acquires again an acid reaction. This second acidity is titrated again with $\\frac{N}{10}$ alkali and this second titration is a measure of the amount of ammonia present. The average quantity of ammonia excreted by the Chinese is .61 gramme, by the Tamil .63, by the Malay .66 and by the Brahmin .57. An European excretes about .7 gramme (Table I). The smaller quantity of ammonia excreted by the Asiatic is due to the fact that he eats a larger proportion of vegetables than the European. Vegetable foods are very rich in bases which unite with the acids of the blood and thus a smaller quantity of ammonia is required from the tissues in order to keep the blood alkaline. Ammonia formation is the physiological remedy for deficiency of bases and is excessive in certain diseases, e.g., acidosis.\n\nChloride.\u2014This is estimated by Volhard\u2019s method in which all the chlorides are precipitated with an excess of standard silver\n| Subject                  | Period of observation | Ammonia | Chloride | Urea   | Total Nitrogen | Ammonia Coefficient | Amount | Specific Gravity |\n|--------------------------|-----------------------|---------|----------|--------|----------------|---------------------|--------|------------------|\n| Chinese in Singapore     | 6 months              | .61 gm. | 5.27 gm. | 16.00 gm. | 9.25 gm.       | 5.4%                | 1273 c.c. | 1012             |\n| Tamil in Singapore       | 6 months              | .63 ,,  | 5.21 ,,  | 14.41 ,,  | 8.24 ,,        | 6.3 ,,              | 1629 ,, | 1009             |\n| Malay in Singapore       | 2 weeks               | .66 ,,  | 8.00 ,,  | 13.35 ,,  | 8.00 ,,        | 6.8 ,,              | 1335 ,, | 1010             |\n| Brahmin in Singapore     | 6 months              | .57 ,,  | 6.34 ,,  | 11.08 ,,  | 6.64 ,,        | 7.1 ,,              | 1396 ,, | 1014             |\n| European in Europe (8)   | .70 ,,                | 11.00 ,, | 35.00 ,, | 16.00 ,,  | 3.6 ,,         | 1500 ,,             |        | 1015             |\n| European in Singapore    | 1 week                | 1.06 ,, | 8.10 ,,  | 25.00 ,,  | 15.30 ,,       | 5.6 ,,              | 1560 ,, | 1012             |\nnitrate; the excess of silver nitrate used is determined by adding standard solution of ammonium sulphocyanate in the presence of a ferric salt. The Chinese excretes 5.27 grammes, the Tamil 5.21, the Malay 8 and the Brahmin 6.34. An European excretes about 11 (Table I). On experimental diets individuals have been kept in good conditions when the total content in sodium chloride is reduced to 1 or 2 grammes per diem. Bunge has called attention to the fact that among men and animals the desire for salt is limited for the most part at least to those that use vegetable food. The potassium salts of the vegetable food react with the sodium chloride forming potassium chloride and a sodium salt, both of which would be excreted by the kidney. The blood will thereby lose some of its supply of sodium chloride, whence the craving for more in the food (3).\n\nUrea.\u2014The method employed calculates the amount of urea by measuring the amount of nitrogen liberated from the urine by sodium hypobromite. Doremus-Heinz ureometer is employed. This method only gives approximate results. The Chinese excretes 16 grammes per diem, the Tamil 14.41, the Malay 13.35, the Brahmin 11.08 whereas the average figure for an European is 35 (Table I). It is well known that the amount of urea depends upon the amount of protein absorbed so that the greater the quantity of absorbable protein in the diet the greater the quantity of urea in the urine. About 80% of the total nitrogen in the urine is excreted in the form of urea.\n\nTotal Nitrogen.\u2014This is estimated by Kjeldahl's method. The Chinese excretes 9.25 grammes per diem, the Tamil 8.24, the Malay 8.0, the Brahmin 6.64, the European figure being 16 (Table I). It is considered accurate to take the nitrogen excretion as an indicator of the amount of protein actually metabolised or used by the body in performing its work. Since nitrogen forms about 16% of protein, the amount of nitrogen excreted multiplied by 6.25 gives the amount of protein metabolised. The figures thus obtained are 57.8 grammes of protein for the Chinese, 51.5 for the Tamil, 50 for the Malay, 41.5 for the Brahmin and 100 for the European. We have seen that the Brahmin eats a good deal more protein than the other Asiatics (Table II), nevertheless he uses a smaller amount in metabolism, so that evidently a smaller proportion of the protein of his food is absorbed. This is due to its bulk and its indigestibility.\n\nAmmonia Coefficient.\u2014This is the amount of nitrogen, excreted as ammonia, expressed in terms of percentage of the total nitrogen. In an European it is 3.6%, in the Chinese student 5.4%, in the Tamil 6.3%, in the Malay 6.8%, and in the Brahmin 7.1% (Table I). It is higher in the Asiatics than in the European because the protein intake is greatly reduced in the Asiatics so that there is a low total nitrogen excretion. Of the Asiatics the Brahmin has the highest coefficient because he excretes the smallest\n\nR. A.

McCay has worked on the diet and nutrition of students in Bengal. He has found that the Bengali students take a smaller proportion of protein food than the Anglo-Indian students who are attending the same college. In opposition to Chittenden's views he attributes the better physique and greater muscular energy of the Anglo-Indian students to this fact. The Bengali student, who averages 115 lbs. in weight eats 67 grammes of protein, only a small quantity of which is obtained from animal sources, 72 of fat and 549 of carbohydrate. This diet has a heat value of 3196 kilocalories. The Anglo-Indian student eats 95 grammes of protein, a big proportion of which comes from animal sources, 56 of fat and 467 of carbohydrate. Although the Bengali eats a smaller amount of protein than the European, he is quite susceptible to kidney troubles (4). One is not justified in concluding that excess of protein is not harmful to the kidney, because there may be reasons to explain the kidney disease in the Bengali which are at present unknown. It is quite evident to physicians that the larger the amount of waste substance to be excreted by the kidney the more is the kidney taxed. In treating kidney disease there is no doubt that cutting down the protein excretion eases the kidney.\n\nAron (5) has made observations on Filipino students, with an average weight of about 115 lbs. They require 75 grammes of protein, 25 of fat and 510 of carbohydrate. This diet gives 2632 kilocalories (Table II).\n\nCommentary.\n\nAs far as my experiments go they show that the medical students of Singapore require less food than the students of Bengal and the Phillipines (Table II). Probably this is due to the climates. In Singapore, Calcutta and Manila, the students wear the same tropical clothes, at least during the hot seasons. Therefore we can exclude the influence of clothes. Singapore has practically no seasonal change throughout the whole year; the temperature varies only slightly, the mean being 80\u00b0F. At Manila in the Phillipines there is some seasonal change, the months of November, December, January and February having a temperate climate. Bengal enjoys a winter. Again the humidity of the atmosphere is greater in Singapore than in Manila and much greater than in Calcutta. The climatic conditions in Singapore, therefore, are more likely to prevent the body losing heat, so that less food is required to keep up the body heat. The average weight in all three cases is about the same. The Singapore students do not take much muscular exercise. This is another probable cause of their small\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 76, 1917.\ndiet and it may be due to the climatic conditions. Europeans are not inclined to take much exercise in the Tropics but they all do so, because it is not possible to keep healthy on an European diet without regular exercise. The writer has made observations (Table I) upon his own kidney excretion, the results showing that he partakes of a diet similar to that taken by him in Scotland. He takes a good deal more exercise in Singapore than he did in Scotland, although he always took an active interest in out-door games in the latter country. Sir Patrick Manson and others have indicated that even in the case of Europeans who do take active exercise, a diet of moderate quantity is necessary to maintain health in the Tropics, if long residence is contemplated. An excess of food materials throws too much work on the excretory organs and owing to the usual free diaphoresis, the fluids taken are insufficient to flush the kidneys properly, or to secure adequate excretion of the solid products by that channel. This inadequate excretion will in time injure all the organs (6). The smaller amount of food taken by the Singapore student may be nature\u2019s way of counteracting the evil effects of the climate.\n\nJudging from McCay\u2019s research the physique and the muscular energy deteriorate on a small amount of protein. Therefore good physique and great muscular energy are incompatible with prolonged residence in a climate like that of Singapore. By prolonged residence is meant a generation or more.\n\nAlthough the Singapore students who have been under observation do not possess the muscular energy of an European student, they have done quite as much brain work as the average European student. The author has had nine years experience with European students and four years experience with Singapore students. It has been shown that brain work does not require extra food; in other words, a lazy student is just as expensive to feed as an hard working student. A man doing hard mental work in Atwater\u2019s respiration chamber gave the same results as when he was resting. Intellectual work has not been found to have any demonstrable quantitative or qualitative effect upon the metabolism of man (7).\n\nRanke\u2019s standard diet for an European living a sedentary life in Europe is appended (Table II) for purposes of comparison.\n\nThe figures obtained by examination of the Asiatic student\u2019s kidney excretions can be explained by the fact that the Asiatic eats a smaller amount of nitrogenous or protein food than the European. It is not likely that these figures will differ very greatly in the hard working Asiatic coolie, because the coolie does not eat much more protein than the student, but he increases the carbohydrate content of his diet.\n\nConclusions.\n\n1. The results obtained from examination of the kidney excretion of local students indicate that the European figures are of no value when dealing with Asiatic patients.\n2. The total nitrogen varies from 6.64 grammes in the Brahmin to 9.25 in the Chinese.\n\n3. The urea varies from 11.08 grammes in the Brahmin to 16.00 in the Chinese.\n\n4. The ammonia varies from .57 gramme in the Brahmin to .66 in the Malay.\n\n5. The ammonia coefficient varies from 5.4% in the Chinese to 7.1 in the Brahmin.\n\n6. The chlorides vary from 5.2 grammes in the Tamil to 8 in the Malay.\n\n7. The Singapore student partakes of a smaller amount of food than the Philippine or Bengali student. This seems to be due directly or indirectly to the climatic conditions of Singapore.\n\nReferences.\n\n1. \"A System of Diet and Dietetics.\" Edited by G. A.

O. Blagden\u00b9.\n\nReviewed by R. O. Winstedt.\n\nIn Malacca in the year 1825, on his mother's side from the well-known family of Neubronner, there was born van der Tuuk, who wrought a Copernican change in the study of Malay comparative philology. Malacca has been the mother of much important Malay literature, of the S\u0113jarah M\u0113layu, the Hang Tuah, and the works of Munshi Abdullah: and then it was the birth-place of this great 'Indolog' van der Tuuk, who has gone without honour in his own place but found it in the pages of the \"Encyclopaedia of the Netherlands Indies.\" We do not enshrine the careers of our students of Malay in an encyclopaedia; so, I should like to record here, that it was four years at Jasin, which inspired Mr. Blagden with his enthusiasm for Malay linguistics and so led to his translating the work under review.\n\nThis translation of Brandstetter's essays was badly wanted. Even to-day, how many British students of Malay are aware of the Copernican change wrought by van der Tuuk in Malayan philology? How many readers of this journal realize that Crawfurd's theories on the subject are no whit more valuable than his dictum to a learned society in Great Britain that whatever else Australia might produce, it could never breed sheep! How many admirers of the \"Journal of the Indian Archipelago\" know that Logan's Tibeto\u2014Annam synthesis is no more fruitful or valid than that of Anglo-Israelites who find in the British the lost tribes of Israel! How many of us have appraised speculations on the syllable bu, bun, or bung in \"words conveying an idea of roundness,\" to be as idle and valueless for scientific philology as Malay surmises that 'Sumatra' is derived from s\u0113mul raya or sama utara!\n\nMaxwell printed his excellent \"Manual of the Malay Language\" in the early '80s; his introduction need not have been defaced by obsolete and untenable views, if he had read van der Tuuk's \"Outlines of a Grammar of the Malagasy Language\" printed in the \"Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain\" in 1865 (and reprinted in \"Essays relating to Indo-China\" in 1887.) That essay should have been a point de rep\u00e8re for English students of Malay philology as it has been for Dutch.\n\n\u00b9 'An Introduction to Indonesian Linguistics' being four essays by Renward Brandstetter, Ph.D., translated by C.

No Englishman pursued the subject further; no Englishman read what the Dutch were doing; in the English language there has been no advance, no further *point de rep\u00e8re* till Mr. Blagden gives us now in English the cream of the philological work of Dr. Brandstetter, a brilliant Swiss scholar of the school of van der Tuuk and Kern.\n\nThe name and work of Brandstetter are not unknown to members of our branch Society. Mr. Blagden gave us an appreciation of his earlier work in Journal XLII, but since then Brandstetter has made great strides.\n\nThe present translation has been termed \"An Introduction to Indonesian Linguistics.\" So vague has been the use of the word 'Indonesian' by British scholars, that it is well to define its meaning. For anthropologists, 'Indonesian' denotes a particular physical strain; for the student of language, it denotes the western division of the great Austronesian (or Malayo-Polynesian or Oceanic) family of speech, the division which irrespectively of racial elements is spoken by the inhabitants of the Philippines, the Malay Archipelago, the Malay Peninsula, the Mergui Archipelago and parts of Indo-China and of Formosa. 'Indonesian' is a term preferable to 'Malayan,' because AChinese or Javanese or Tagalog are no more Malay than Spanish is Italian. Mr. Blagden points out how \"Malay in many ways is not a very typical member of the family; its grammar has been much worn down and simplified; and for various other reasons it is unfortunate that so many people are tempted to survey the whole Indonesian field, with its luxuriant diversity, through the rather distorting lens of a knowledge of Malay alone. There has been a very widespread tendency among Malay scholars to regard Malay as the standard or norm of the Indonesian family and to attempt to explain the differences which they noticed in the other languages as deviations from that standard; and that is very far from being the true view.\"\n\nOf late years, the great Austronesian family has been linked definitively with an Austroasiatic family, which embraces a number of the languages of India and Indo-China, such as Munda, Khasi, Mon Khmer, Nicobarese and Sakai. Kern has shown how Indo-China was probably the point whence the proto-Malay descended on the Archipelago. When French research in Cambodia has progressed even further than it has to-day, when we have fuller dictionaries of Munda and Khasi and conversations recorded in Sakai and when Mr. Blagden has published his work on Talaing (or Mon or Peguan) inscriptions\u2014perhaps some day the synthesis between the two great families may be worked out in detail. Meanwhile Brandstetter finds more than enough material awaiting study in the Indonesian section of the one family.\n\nFour of Brandstetter's best essays are included in the present volume, and Mr. Blagden has supplied cross-references, where the subject matter overlaps.\n\"Root and Word in the Indonesian Languages\" is the first essay. It deals with the extraction of roots from stem-words, which are normally dissyllabic in Indonesian languages; and it describes the morphological process by which stem-words have been constructed by means of formative syllables, usually prefixes, sometimes infixes more rarely suffixes,\u2014formatives which cannot become roots themselves. Compare a series of stem-words and we find often a common syllable running through them, as lok through t\u0113lok, k\u0113lok, j\u0113lok, p\u0113lok; it may be inferred that all those dissyllabic words are constructed from lok. Maxwell surmised that in tangkap we have the Sakai teng 'hand.' It is not absolutely impossible, considering that a few Indonesian stem-words are built up by the juxtaposition of two roots. But it is exceedingly improbable and far-fetched: compare ch\u0113kap, t\u0113kap, t\u0113rkap, tangkap, rangkap, chakup, ch\u0113kup, t\u0113kup, s\u0113r\u0113kup, tangkup: we have the common syllables kap, kup and, as a matter of fact, t and ch will be found to be common Indonesian prefixes and ng a common Indonesian infix. The comparative method throws light, where the study of Malay alone would lead nowhere: it shows for example how s\u0113sal, s\u0113sip, t\u0113tap, s\u0113sak are instances of reduplication of roots and appear in Madurese as s\u0113ls\u0113l, s\u0113ps\u0113p, t\u0113pt\u0113p, s\u0113ks\u0113k: and again how d\u0113- is a common Indonesian formative making word-bases from interjections. Among the roots that can serve as word-bases, Brandstetter detects onomatopoeic interjections, other interjections, baby words, forms of address, monosyllabic prepositions and pronouns. He uses the comparative method with strict adherence to phonetic laws\u2014a principle our smatterers in Malay philology have always failed to observe.\n\nThe second essay deals with \"Common Indonesian and Original Indonesian\" mainly from the point of view of phonetics and grammar. If a word or formative is found throughout the Indonesian area or in two or three widely distant parts of that area, then it must be regarded as common and primitive. Crawfurd's notion of Malay and Javanese influencing a number of tongues originally unconnected is exploded for ever. The essay is extraordinarily suggestive and does much to solve the vexed problems of Malay formatives, verbal substantival and adjectival. Incidentally Brandstetter shows how there were more monosyllabic words in the original language than are now in use and how the grammatical system was fuller than it is, for example, in modern Malay. And here I should like to invite attention to the nicer nuances of the formatives in old Malay literature like the S\u0113jarah M\u0113layu and the S\u0113ri Rama, where later authors display carelessness or ignorance. How many modern writers could be trusted to write jika ia b\u0113rbuang kuku, \"if he cut his nails.\"\n\nThe \"Indonesian Verb,\" the third essay in this volume, does still more to explain the nature of the verb and its formatives. The importance of the subject for students of Malay will be obvious to all who have struggled with de Hollander's 'subjective-passive'\ntheory or been amazed at Ophuijsen's attempt to discover conjugation in Malay and to explain the *di* in *di-makan-nya* as a contraction of *dia!* Brandstetter shows that some at least of the verbal formatives appear to have been once separate parts of speech, notably prepositions and articles. To prove how wide-based are his theories it is only necessary to point out that the following languages were selected as a basis for the study which resulted in this essay:\n\nPhilippines: 1 Bontok\u20142 Tagalog.\nCelebes: 3 Tontemboan\u20144 Bareqe\u20145 Macassar\u20146 Bugis.\nBorneo: 7 Dayak\u20148 Basa Sangiang.\nJava: 9 Old Javanese\u201410 Modern Javanese.\nIslands towards New Guinea: 11 Kamberese\u201412 Kupangese\u201413 Rottinese\u201414 Masaretese.\nSumatra: 15 Minangkabau\u201416 Toba\u201417 Karo\u201418 Gayo\u201419 Achinese.\nIslands at the back of Sumatra: 20 Mentaway\u201421 Nias.\nMalay Peninsula: 22 Malay.\nMadagascar: 23 Hova\u201424 Old Malagasy.\n\nEssay IV was published in 1915 and deals with the \"Phonetic Phenomena in the Indonesian Languages.\" Perhaps it is the most epoch-making of the essays in this volume; with its clear summary of the phonetic laws of the simple sounds of the Indonesian languages, its delineation of the *p\u0113p\u0113t* law, the R. G. H. law, the *hamzah* law, the law of the *mediae*, the diphthongs and aspirates and their laws. It is useless to try to abbreviate in a review an essay so packed with important matter. If ever an attempt is made to produce a comparative dictionary of an Indonesian language, the lexicographer will need to have this essay by heart.\n\nIt is to be hoped that Dr. Brandstetter will continue to write essays on the Indonesian languages of the quality of those in this volume; that Mr. Blagden will find time to translate them, and our parent Society the will to print them.\n\nEven for those of us whose interest hardly extends beyond colloquial Malay, this volume should prove stimulating and illuminating. He also serves the cause of Malay studies who buys the few works that are written on the subject: and the present volume is infinitely the most important that has ever appeared in English on Malay philology.\nFoliated Pattern in Malay Carving and Silverwork.\n\nBy R. O. Winstedt.\n\nOn p. 48 of my paper on \"Malay Industries, Part I,\" \"Arts and Crafts\" (Kuala Lumpur, 1909), I wrote of Malay repouss\u00e9 work. \"It owes many of its patterns to Indian influence\u2014the conventional lotus flower, the leaf of the sacred fig and so on\u2014but there is not a technical term that is foreign for metal (gold and silver) tool or pattern, so that there would seem to be no reason why it should be inferred to be Indian in origin. Indeed it must be something more than coincidence that foliated pattern of the same chaste restraint and conventional character is the note of Malay wood-carving.\"\n\nAfter a visit last year to the famous Bara-bodor in Java, I am persuaded that it is due to \"something more than coincidence\" that Malay and Javanese carvings and silverwork have their chaste foliated patterns:\u2014namely, to Indian influence. The foliation carved between the panels illustrating the life of the Buddha on that wonderful memorial is identical with the foliation loved by the Malay craftsman, e.g. the socalled 'pine-apple' or 'side view of the lotus' pattern. This can be seen clearly, too, on some of the picture-postcards sold of the Bara-bodor. It would be interesting to know if there are similar foliated patterns on the ruins of Angkor Wat?\nContributions to our Knowledge of the Flora of Borneo.\n\nBY E. D. MERRILL.\n\nBotanist, Bureau of Science, Manila, P. I.\n\nIn a previous paper on the Bornean flora* I briefly indicated the striking differences between the relationships of the Philippine-Moluccan floras on the one hand, and the Philippine-Bornean floras on the other hand, describing forty-eight new species of Bornean plants and one new genus, and crediting a number of other species previously described by other authors to Borneo. The present paper is in the nature of a continuation of the first one published; and in it I have described thirty-nine new species and credited about twenty-five additional ones to Borneo for the first time. The types of the new species proposed are preserved in the herbarium of the Bureau of Science, Manila, P. I.\n\nIn the present paper new species are described in the following families: Gramineae, Cyperaceae, Rosaceae, Leguminosae, Rutaceae, Meliaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Vitaceae, Elaeocarpaceae, Tiliaceae, Thymelaeaceae, Ericaceae, Symplocaceae, Verbenaceae, and Rubiaceae. Perhaps the one addition to the Bornean flora of greatest interest is the discovery of a representative of the genus Faradaya in British North Borneo, this characteristic genus having been known previously only from New Guinea, north-eastern Australia, and Polynesia. To the rather small list of species known only from Borneo and the Philippines are added Artocarpus odoratissima Blanco, Knema glomerata Merr., Ellipanthus mindanaensis Merr., Grewia stylocarpa Warb. (a variety in Borneo), and Symplocos phanerophlebia Merr. Genera new to Borneo are Scleropryrum, Elaeodendron, Columbia, and Faradaya. The new generic name Hoseanthus is proposed for the form that Ridley described as Hosea, on account of the previous use of the name Hosea by Dennstaedt for a different group of plants.\n\nGRAMINEAE.\n\nAndropogon, Linnaeus.\n\nAndropogon serratus, Thunb. var. nitidus (Vahl) Hack. in DC.

Winstedt.\n\nThe area over which a folk-tale has spread proves nothing conclusively except the range of its popularity. But in view of Schmidt\u2019s synthesis of the Austroasiatic and Malayo-Polynesian families of language and of the evidence which Professor Kern has marshalled to show that Indo-China possibly was the region whence the Malay race descended on the Archipelago, it is interesting to note the occurrence of identical tales in the Indonesian and Mon-Khmer languages. For the folk-lore of Indo-China I have consulted Aymonier\u2019s *Textes Khmers*, Landes\u2019 *Contes et L\u00e9gendes Annamites*, Landes\u2019 *Contes Tjames* (Saigon 1887) and for Mon or Talaing tales *The Journal of the Burma Research Society*. For folk-tales of the Malay Archipelago, I have used an article on \u201cContes Javanais\u201d by Dr. Hazeu in a fasciculus entitled *Hommage au Congr\u00e8s des Orientalistes de Hanoi de la part du Bataviaasch Genootschap van Kunsten en Wetenschappen* (Batavia 1902). For folk-tales purely Malay I refer to my *Malay Literature, Part II* (1907) in the series of *Papers on Malay Subjects* published by the F. M. S. Government, to Skeat\u2019s *Fables and Folk-tales from an Eastern Forest* (Cambridge, 1901); and also to *Ch\u00e8rita J\u00e9naka* edited by myself and Mr. Sturrock and to the *Hikayat Pelandok* edited by Mr. Dussek, both of them printed in the *Malay Literature Series* (Singapore).\n\nIn No. 45 of this Journal I gave in English \u201cSome Mouse-deer tales*\u201d: on pp. 13 and 14 of *Malay Literature, Part II*, I have quoted from that paper the tale of how Mouse-deer cheated Tiger over Solomon\u2019s gong, which proved to be a wasp\u2019s nest, his viol which proved to be a slit bamboo, his saffron rice which proved to be dung, his turban (or belt, in some versions) which proved to be a coiled snake. The Malay version is given in Dussek\u2019s *Hikayat Pelandok*. There are also Dayak and Javanese and Sundanese versions. It finds a close parallel in \u201cLes Ruses du Li\u00e8vre\u201d recorded (pp. 50-60) in Landes\u2019 *Contes Tjames*, and is found among the Cambodians (*vide* Aymonier\u2019s *Textes Khmers*) and among the Annamites (*vide* Landes\u2019 *Contes et l\u00e9gendes Annamites*). I will give in outline the Cham version: it is significant that the \u201chare\u201d\u2014the Cham word is *tapay*\u2014gores (*encorner*) the elephant with his horn (*de la corne*) (p. 59)!\n\n---\n\n* The story how Mouse-deer escaped from crocodile by pretending that his leg was a withered twig is very common in India where Jackal takes the place of Mouse-deer.

Soc., No. 76, 1917.\nOne day the tiger, the hare, the otter, the hen, and the elephant went to cut straw to make a house. They left the tiger at their camp and he caught deer and cooked them rice and venison on their return. The next day the otter was left and he dived into the river and caught fish and cooked it for the other beasts. Then the hen took her turn and served up a dish of eggs. Finally it fell to the hare to cater. The hare was at a loss; so filled the rice-pot with dung (crottes), mixed it with stinking fish-paste (nw\u00f3\u00e9 m\u00e1m) and invited his companions to regale themselves. The hare pleaded a head-ache and no appetite! He yawned and cried hay \u00eah taputj, hay \u00eah taputj, a nonsense cry, suggesting hwutj \u00eah tapay, \u2018I smell tapai\u2019s dung:\u2019\u2014a cry which reveals to the beasts what they have eaten! Then they go and load their straw on the back of the elephant, and allow hare, as an invalid, to lie on it. He groans and asks the hen to hand him a fire-brand to keep his body warm. He blows it up and sets fire to the straw! And he shouts to the others to lead the elephant to windward. The otter extinguishes the flames by taking the elephant into the water. The hare, afraid of being killed by his companions, hides himself in the forest. He comes upon a snake who coils round him. The tiger discovers the hare and asks what he is doing. \u201cI\u2019ve donned a girdle of flowers, an heirloom of mine\u201d says the hare. The tiger wants to put on the girdle. The hare demurs from dawn till noon. Then he bids the tiger get a thorn, and prick the nose of the python. The python uncoils from the hare and coils round the tiger. Hare calls, \u201cCome, men, and kill the tiger. The python has seized him.\u201d Men rush up with knives but the tiger bites the python and escapes. Tiger pursues hare and finds him beating a drum! The hare had stopped up the exit of a wasps\u2019 nest and was beating the nest and making the wasps buzz. Said the tiger, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d The hare replied, \u201cI\u2019m beating a drum left to me by my ancestors; it is a great solace, when I\u2019m in the mood.\u201d The tiger asked to be allowed to beat it. The hare demurred; at last, he consented, adding, \u201cIf you wish to get a harmonious sound out of the drum, open the hole below and close that on top.\u201d The tiger follows this advice and beats the drum! Out swarm the wasps and sting him! The hare flees from the tiger and coming to a tree, whose branches rub together, climbs into it. The tiger enraged comes to the tree and bids the hare descend to be eaten. \u201cAllow me till noon,\u201d pleads the hare, \u201cto enjoy the strains of this sharanai (= Malay s\u00e9runai), an heirloom of mine.\u201d At noon the wind blew the branches together and made a noise. The tiger thought it was a musical instrument and begged leave to play it. \u201cEat me,\u201d said the hare, \u201cfor I can\u2019t allow it.\u201d The tiger persisted. \u201cWell\u201d said the hare, \u201cwait till the wind blows and then apply your tongue to this interstice.\u201d The tiger did so, and his tongue was nipped! \u201cCome men,\u201d cried the hare, \u201cthe tiger is caught in a tree.\u201d As the men came up, the tiger wrenched his tongue free, losing the tip of it, and vanished. In running away, the hare fell into a\ndry pit. Up came the tiger and asked what he was doing. The hare answered, \"Don't you know? To-morrow morning the sky is going to fall: I stay here to avoid being crushed.\" Said the tiger, \"Pity me! Let me get into the pit with you,\" \"I won't\" said the hare. The tiger beseeched the hare from dawn till noon, when at last the hare consented. The hare told the tiger to cut a stick and give it to him. He prodded the tiger. \"If you play the fool,\" said the tiger; \"I'll make you jump up there, where the sky will crush you.\" The hare persists and is made to jump up out of the pit. \"I'm off for a drink,\" says the hare, \"and I'll return presently.\" The hare goes to a house where men are feasting and cries to them to go to the pit and kill the tiger. The men run to the pit. The hare enters the house, eats all the cakes and collects cups and bowls and hides them under a mat. He wraps a red kerchief round his head and beats a drum. The tiger roars and the men run home to see their cakes have disappeared. They think the hare is under the mat, beat it with sticks and smash their crockery! They see the hare on the roof, cannot reach him and set fire to the house. The hare leaps on to another roof and escapes. The hare sees the mistress of the house, where he had upset the feast, going to market to buy cakes bananas and sugar. He awaits her return, and pretends to be lying dead on the road. The woman picks him up and puts him in her basket, where he devours her purchases and skips away, when she opens the lid. The hare meets the elephant, who is weeping. \"Why do you weep?\" asked he. \"I and the tiger agreed to roar,\" said the elephant; \"if I trumpeted so as to terrify all the beasts and birds of the forest, I was to eat the tiger: if he roared so as to terrify them, he was to eat me. He won and is going to eat me to-morrow morning.\" The hare replied, \"Let me save you. Get me betel and to-morrow morning, when I run under you and strike you with my horns, pretend to fall down dead and roll over as I butt you.\" The elephant did so: the hare butted him as he rolled and spat the blood-red betel juice over his body. The tiger saw it and thought the hare had gored the elephant, and he was afraid and fled away. The tiger met a tortoise and told him of what had happened. The tortoise said \"Tie me to you with a rattan and I'll take you to kill the hare.\" The tiger did so; they met the hare and the tiger fled, knocking the tortoise insensible against a tree stump. Presently the tortoise revived. He was bleeding and he said to the tiger, \"Lick this betel juice off me.\" The tiger licked, thinking it was blood.\n\nFor the story of the hare stumbling into a pit and crying out that he was there to avoid the falling sky, there are parallels in my tales recorded in Journal No. 45, and in Klinkert's Hikayat Pelandok Djinaka (Leiden 1885)\u2014which is reprinted in Dussek's Hikayat Pelandok. And there is a parallel for the Cham story of the hare saving the elephant from the tiger in Skeat's Fables and Folk-tales. Skeat's story relates how elephant and tiger wagered to make monkey fall from a tree; whoever succeeded was to be\neaten by the other. Tiger succeeded, but when he wanted to claim the penalty, mouse-deer poured molasses down the elephant's back, told him to trumpet as if in pain and standing on his back made believe to gnaw him. The tiger fled in terror, till the ape told him it was only a mouse-deer; but the mouse-deer made tiger flee once more by crying \"Why did you not bring two tigers, ape, for my meal instead of one?\" Both in my collection and in Klinkert's Hikayat betel juice is used by the mouse-deer to simulate blood.\n\nAnother Malay mouse-deer tale finds its parallel in Mon (or Talaing) folk-lore, where, according to the translator a \"squirrel\" takes the place of the mouse-deer. Skeat calls the Malay tale, \"The tiger gets his deserts.\" There is the same tale, with the variation that a fallen tree takes the place of the trap and buffaloes the place of the man and crocodile the place of tiger, in my tales in Journal No. 45 and in Dussek's \"Hikayat Kanchil\" in the book Hikayat Pelandok. The Mon tale has even the same literary device as the Malay story wherein a road, a tree, a sleeping-mat and a dish-cover are severally consulted on the question of altruism\u2014vide p. 12 Malay Literature, Part II, and p. 2 Hikayat Pelandok. The Mon tale has been recorded by Stewart on p. 49, Vol. IV, Part I (April 1914) of the Journal of the Burma Research Society:\n\n\"Long ago, a man went to the forest and found a tiger caught in a trap. 'Set me free' the tiger called to him, 'O lord of benefits.'\n\n'If I set you free, am I safe from you? Will you eat me?'\n\n'I will not eat you. Do but set me free.' So the man went and released the tiger and the tiger said, 'I've long been without food and now I am going to eat you.'\n\n'It is not fit that you should eat the man who set you free. But let us go and hear the judgment of the Dewatas of the tree in the middle of the clearing........O Dewatas, I set the tiger free. Is it fit or not that he should eat me?'\n\nAnd the Dewatas of the tree replied, 'Lo, men come and go and rest under my shade. My branches they break and sit upon them. Therefore,' said the Dewatas of the tree, 'it is fit that the tiger eat thee.'\n\nThen the tiger said, 'Now I am going to eat you.' But the man said, 'Nay, we will go to the Dewatas of the Bridge.........' Oh Dewatas, the tiger was caught in a trap and I set him free. Is it fit or not that he should eat me?' And the Dewatas of the Bridge replied, 'Lo, men cross over upon me and some use me for unworthy purposes. Therefore,' said the Dewatas of the Bridge, 'it is fit that the tiger eat thee.'\n\n'Now' said the tiger, 'I am going to eat you.' 'Wait yet a little' said the man. 'When you have the third judgment in your favour, eat me.' So they went and came to a squirrel, and the\nsquirrel when he saw the man fled. The man followed, shouting, \"Wait, be our instructor and decide our case.\" Hearing this, the squirrel stopped and said, 'Don't you come near; speak to me from a distance.' Then the man told the circumstances of the case and the squirrel said, 'I myself did not see these things happen. I cannot decide. Show me the place where the tiger was caught. Let us go and see. But how shall we go? I do not trust you two. Let the tiger go first, the man next and I will follow.' When they came to the trap, the squirrel asked, 'How was the tiger placed. Show me, tiger-beast\u2014get into the trap\u2014how you were bound, how you were released. Have you tied him fast? Now tiger can you move?' 'Hardly at all,' said the tiger. 'Oh man, is he tied fast?' 'As fast as can be' said the man. 'Tiger' said the squirrel, 'you have no conscience. Let the man go as he came. I will go as I came. Let the tiger remain in the trap. Thus I give judgment?\"\n\nThis is a very common Indian story. It is told in the Gul Bakuwali. It may be found also in F. A. Steel's Tales of the Punjab (pp. 107, 307, 336) where a pipal tree, a buffalo yoked to an oil-press and the road are asked about altruism. And it occurs in Thibet.\n\nThere is a set of Malay 'clock' sayings:\n\nBangau, bangau! k\u0113napa kau-kurus?\nBagai-mana aku ta' kurus? Ikan ta' timbul.\nIkan, ikan!

A. F. von Dewall also has printed \"Tj\u0113rit\u0113ra Pak B\u0113lalang\" in his Bunga Rampai, Part IV (Batavia, 1902). The tale occurs in Central Celebes, among the Bataks and in Macassar\u2014vide pp. 377-379 of a paper by Dr. Adriani on the literature of the Toradja (Tijdschrift, Bat. Gen. XI, deel 4). Among the Sundanese, the hero bears the name of Aki Bolong (cf. Grashuis' Soendaneesch Leesboek); among the Javanese the name of Pak Bandjir\u2014in 1873 R. F. Bastiaan printed a metrical version of \"Pak Bandjir\" (Semarang, von Dorp). And Dr. Hazeu mentions a tale known in Batavia and called \"Djankar-Djangkrik\" which is a variant of \"Pak Bandjir.\" Now Niemann has pointed out (Bijdragen, Koninklijk Instituut 6 I p. 348) how the Khmer story of Thm\u0113nh Chey (Aymonier, Textes Khmers, pp. 20-30) has many points of resemblance with the Indonesian story. For instance, Thm\u0113nh Chey is ordered by a prince of Cambodia to solve a riddle propounded by the emperor of China, namely as to the number of seeds in a Chinese water-melon; and by a lucky accident, such as saved Pa Belalang on a similar occasion, Thm\u0113nh Chey solves it.\n\nDr. Hazeu gives a Batavian story of \"Si K\u0113bayan,\" which bears resemblance to the adventures of A. Lev. recorded on p. 3. sqq. of Aymonier's Textes Khmers. A man called Pak Bali wants to marry his daughter to some one with a \"sharp nose\" (hidong tajam). Kebayan secretes sugar coffee and sweets in Pak Bali's house and wins the daughter by pretending to nose them! Kebayan goes with his father-in-law to cut bamboo, but tiring of the work exclaims, \"I smell a tiger,\" which puts an end to the day's toil. Kebayan and his father-in-law go to the tomb of the latter's wife to pray but growing tired Kebayan exclaims, \"I smell the devil,\" which puts an end to their devotions.\n\nThere are the Javanese tales of Watu-Gunong and Nawang-Wulan, which occur moreover among many of the peoples of the Malay Archipelago\u2014see p. 379 of Adriani's paper cited above. Parallels to these tales are to be found in Contes et l\u00e9gendes Anna-mites (LIII and LIV), in Landes' Excursions and Reconnaissances X p. 43.

However but for Mr. Ridley's correction of some of the nomenclature in the Journal for 1916, I could not have done even this.\n\nThe genus is one of the Ternstroemiaceae, and the relationship to *Camellia* and *Thea* is fairly well suggested by the figure above.\n\nJour. Straits Branch R. A. Soc., No. 76, 1917.\nThe founding of Gordonia on an American plant.\n\nThe first Gordonia to become known was the American Loblolly Bay. In the eighteenth century it was a by-no-means rare shrub in the gardens of the curious in Natural History in Western Europe, as, from its home on the Atlantic seaboard from Maryland southwards to the mouths of the Mississippi, its seeds had been easy to procure, and the plant which attains the size of a tree in its own home, was found to flower in hot houses as a shrub. Linnaeus, as early as 1737, named it Hypericum Lasianthus when writing his catalogue of Clifford\u2019s garden, and repeated this name in his Species plantarum. Then John Ellis, a London merchant, who interested himself especially in what ships could bring him from the New World, upon the examination of a plant which flowered at Clapham, cut it apart from the genus Hypericum, and named it Gordonia (1770) after a well-known nurseryman, James Gordon then living in London.\n\nFrom another plant cultivated at Vauxhall, on the outskirts of London, John Sims in 1802 figured flowers and foliage on plate 668 of the Botanical Magazine.\n\nLinnaeus accepted the name Gordonia from the first and used it in his Mantissa plantarum altera, 1771, p. 570.\n\nInto the genus Gordonia so established, another American plant was soon placed,\u2014G. pubescens, (L\u2019H\u00e9ritier, Stirpes novae, 1784, p. 156), a tree found like G. Lasianthus on the Atlantic seaboard of the United States.\n\nGordonia found in Asia, but called Camellia.\n\nOn American soil, Gordonia has proved to be confined to these two species, the second of which is now reported extinct in a wild state. But above a score of species have been found in Asia.\n\nAt first there was some confusion among the European botanists in the East as to what should be called Gordonia, so that we meet with G. oblonga and G. integrifolia in Roxburgh\u2019s works, and G. Chilaunia in Buchanan-Hamilton\u2019s, applied to what is now regarded as Schima: and there occurs a G. spectabilis in the manuscript of William Hunter, of 1803 (printed in Journal No. 54, 1909, p. 104) which is doubtless also a Schima. At the same period, but on the other hand, a true Gordonia of Chinese origin found its way into the genus Camellia. This last is the G. axillaris of Hongkong,\u2014the first recorded plant of which was brought to the London nursery of Messrs. Whitley, Brames and Milne. In December, 1818, it flowered for the first time, and both the then-existing rival illustrated London botanical journals,\u2014the Botanical Magazine and the Botanical Register,\u2014obtained a drawing and both published under the date of February 1st, 1819. So similar are these two plates which we know came from the same plant, that\nthey appear to have been drawn from the same branch, and not only from the same branch, but from the same branch with the same flower open. But in the letter press there are differences which must be referred to, the most important of which is that, under plate 349 of the *Botanical Register*, Ker, editing for Sydenham Edwards, wrote that the possessors of the plant had got it some years before from the late Dr. Roxburgh, the Superintendent of the Honourable East India Company\u2019s garden at Calcutta, and that Roxburgh had got it from Penang; whereas in the *Botanical Magazine* under plate 2047, Sims wrote that it was thought to be one of some Camellias received a few years previously from a Mr. Robarts from China.\n\nWhile thus diverging both writers used the name *Camellia axillaris* referring to a manuscript left by Roxburgh, which the one called a Flora of India and the other merely a manuscript in the possession of Sir Joseph Banks. It is evident from the *Botanical Register* that Robert Brown, then librarian to Sir Joseph Banks, had been consulted; and it is therefore hardly possible to avoid the conclusion that Brown had identified the plant, but we do not know from what, as the published *Flora indica* of Roxburgh does not contain *Camellia axillaris*.\n\n**Roxburgh\u2019s connection with this plant is very doubtful.**\n\nIt is well known that before Roxburgh\u2019s death in 1815 he had furnished to various scientists copies of his Flora, keeping one in his own possession when he sailed from India, with the intention of revising it for publication, and that seventeen years after the father\u2019s death his two sons, Captains Bruce and James Roxburgh, caused the part dealing with the Higher Plants to be printed at Serampore in India, it is said \u201cexactly as he had left it.\u201d Are we to assume that Banks had in 1819 a copy with late notes which escaped publication in 1832? It appears so: for, though Sir William Thiselton-Dyer records (*Journal of the Linnean Society of London*, XIII, 1873, p. 330) that he had searched in vain for the diagnosis of *Camellia axillaris*, (i) Brown would be unlikely to misquote, (ii) the two rivals would be unlikely both to misrepresent him, and (iii) the form of the brief diagnosis is just such as Roxburgh used. It was rendered from English into latin in both works with the term villous for describing the calyx in the *Botanical Register* but the term silky in its place in the *Botanical Magazine*.\n\nSo far then we may accept it that Roxburgh appears to have handled a plant from Penang which he called *Camellia axillaris*; but that does not prove it to be the Chinese plant which was described under this name in 1819; and, indeed, it is more likely that Ker invented the connection of the individual in Whitley, Brames and Milne\u2019s nursery with Roxburgh as a sequel to Brown\u2019s identification than that Sims is wrong in saying that a Mr. Robarts sent it from China. In any case the species does not grow in Penang, and though it could have reached Roxburgh via Penang from the\nChina coast the diagnosis as quoted is so very meagre, that it might easily apply to another plant of the same order such as occurs in Penang.\n\nThere is among the dried plants distributed by Wallich in 1832, a specimen labelled *Camellia axillaris* which is not the *Camellia axillaris* of (? Brown ex) Sims and Ker; and as the diagnosis does not fit it, it is probably some substitute. But it is said that the handwriting is Roxburgh\u2019s, and therein must be indubitable proof that Roxburgh used the name for some unrecognised species.\n\n**This Asiatic Gordonia persists in cultivation.**\n\nProbably from 1819 forward this Chinese plant so introduced by Whitley, Brames and Milne, was not lost to European gardens: it finds mention in several publications of the immediately following years, the chief of which was Robert Sweet\u2019s *Hortus Britannicus*, 1826, wherein the genus *Polyspora* was put forward for it and it became *Polyspora axillaris*. In 1842 it was at Kew, having been received from Li\u00e8ge, and flowered, furnishing plate 4019 of the *Botanical Magazine*, under which Sir William Hooker confidently stated it to be Chinese because he had got dried specimens from China. Quite recently (*Gardener\u2019s Chronicle*, lxi, p. 250, June 23rd, 1917) it has been figured again from Kew.\n\nThere are certain differences between Hooker\u2019s plate and the two which went before it, which may be touched upon next.\n\n**It appears to exhibit gynodioecism but this was not suspected.**\n\nIt had not escaped the wonderful acumen of Robert Brown that there was something sexually imperfect in the flower of the plant which he saw in 1818: it appeared female; but the flowers of the plant which flowered in Kew in 1842 were apparently fully hermaphrodite. This evidence of the occurrence of gyno-dioecism in the species is now supported by the discovery of similar sexual variations in allied plants. But apparently Choisy who monographed the order in 1855 did not appreciate it, so that (*M\u00e9moires de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 physique de Gen\u00e8ve*, xiv, p. 141) he thought it necessary to make two species,\u2014*G. axillaris* and *G. Lessertii*, of the two, and in doing this he appears also to have made some further confusion.\n\n**Gordonia recognised as an Asiatic genus; the sequence in which species were detected.**\n\nReturning to the year 1826 when Sweet tried to establish the genus *Polyspora* for *Camellia axillaris*, not putting it into *Gordonia* perhaps because there were in *Gordonia* the misplaced plants named on p. 134, we come to the announcement by the Dutch botanist Blume of the occurrence of *Gordonia excelsa* in Java, being the first\nplacing of a true Asiatic Gordonia correctly. But it was not long before Wallich also recognised the genus; and species were added to species in the following order:\n\n1826. *G. excelsa*, Blume, a plant which occurs sparsely in the mountain forests of both east and west Java, between 1,500 and 7,000 feet.\n\n1832. *G. obtusa*, Wallich\u00b9, South-western India from the Konkan southwards in mountains between 2,000 and 7,000 feet, plentiful in the Nilgiri Hills.\n\n1832. *G. singaporiana*, Wallich\u00b9, in Singapore at low levels and also in Malacca; in Penang about the hill tops. It is the *G. grandis*, of King, but not of Andr\u00e9.\n\n1840. *G. zeylanica*, Wight, Ceylon in the forests from 4,000 to 7,000 feet.\n\n1846. *G. elliptica*, Gardner, Ceylon in the forests of the Central Province, but doubtfully distinct from the last.\n\n1855. *G. speciosa*, Choisy, Ceylon, very local in the higher mountains.\n\n1860. *G. brevifolia*, Hooker fil., Borneo on the Mountain of Kinabalu at 8,000 feet.\n\n1860. *G. Lobbii*, Hooker fil., Borneo in Sarawak.\n\n1874. *G. Maingayi*, Dyer, Perak and Malacca, on the lower slopes of mountains.\n\n1876. *G. dipterosperma*, Kurz, Sikkim Himalaya and Khasia hills. It has been reduced to *G. excelsa*, Blume, in several works.\n\n1880. *G. grandis*, Andr\u00e9, a garden plant, imperfectly known.\n\n1886. *G. luzonica*, Vidal, Luzon, common in the higher mountains. It was redescribed in 1906 as *G. fragrans*, Merrill.\u00b2\n\n1890. *G. Scortechinii*, King, Perak.\n\n1890. *G. imbricata*, King, Perak and Pahang, in the mountains.\n\n1890. *G. multinervis*, King, Perak and Singapore.\n\n1906. *G. sinensis*, Hemsley and E. H. Wilson, S.-W. China on Mount Omi.\n\n1908. *G. Welborni*, Elmer, Southern Philippine islands in mountains.\n\n1910. *G. Balansae*, Pitard, Tonkin on the Mountain of Ravi near Sougi.\n\n1910. *G. tonkinensis*, Pitard, Tonkin, in the neighbourhood of Ninh-binh.\n\n\u00b9 Wallich's lithographed catalogue of the plants in the East India Company's herbarium has been ruled to be no publication: but these names, are valid nevertheless, though not from 1832.\n\n\u00b2 Mr. Merrill himself reduces this.\n\n*G. acuminata*, Vidal (*G. Vidalii*, Szyszylowicz) described from Luzon in 1886 is shown by Mr. E. D. Merrill not to be a Gordonia at all.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 76, 1917.\n1916. *G. penangensis*, Ridley, Penang and Singapore. It was misnamed *G. excelsa* by King in 1890.\n\n1916. *G. hirtella*, Ridley, mountains of the Malay Peninsula from Perak to Negri Sembilan.\n\nTo these 24 species I have four to add, being *G. taipingensis* from the hills near Taiping, *G. concentricicatrix* from Selangor, *G. Havilandii* from Sarawak and *G. lanceifolia* also from Sarawak, making 28 in all; but as I consider the Asiatic species of *Haemocharis* to be Gordonias, the genus is really in my view of well over 30 species: but all of them want more study.\n\n**Attempt to divide Gordonia in conformity with its discontinuous distribution.**\n\nSzyszylowicz (in Engler\u2019s *Pflanzenfamilien*, iii. part 6, 1893 p. 185) divided the genus Gordonia into two sections, the American species forming the first, and the Asiatic species the second. He gave no sectional names, and did not define the two. Korthals and Pitard have separately gone further in attempts to cut the Asiatic species from the American. Korthals\u2019 attempt was made long ago (*Verhandel. over de Natuurlijke Geschiedenis der Nederland overzeeische Bezittingen*, Kruidkundig, 1839-1842). He made two new genera to hold the Malayan species regardless of the existence of *Polyspora*; and on p. 127 he wrote \u201cThe plants on which the genera *Antheeischima* and *Closaschima* (his new genera) have been established, were formerly written up and described under the genus *Gordonia*, but a closer comparison with material of the American types, leads me to observe that this union of Indian and American plants can be severed, and leads me on into presenting two new genera for the former, cut out of *Gordonia*.\u201d This shows him dominated by the idea that plants from opposite hemispheres should not be in the same genus. And he continues defining the first genus *Antheeischima* upon doubtful interpretations of its bracts and calyx adding the last sepal (which is seen in fig. 1. to the top and right) to the petals and another sepal to the bracts so as to reduce the number to 3; and on \u201cthe stamens being free in *Gordonia* or united into five bundles; but in *Antheeischima* grown together with the petals into a ring.\u201d He next admits this genus as rather indistinctly defined but \u201c*Closaschima* differs by reason of its more shrubby growth, lesser development of leaves, and flowers and in some floral characters; it has five or apparently by the enlargement of a bract six sepals, five petals spirally arranged and five stigmas almost without styles.\u201d\n\nThe last character is that of *Haemocharis* into which his genus has been placed in later years, while the single species making the genus *Antheeischima* has been returned to *Gordonia* as Blume\u2019s *G. excelsa*. Yet Korthals continues under *Closaschima* to describe the *C. marginata* as having a style.\nPitard has taken a roughly parallel line. In the *Actes de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Linn\u00e9enne de Bordeaux*, 1902, Comptes rendus, p. 54, he tries to establish the genus *Nabiasodendron* for the Asiatic Gordonias, at the same time separating the two American species from each other generically. Like Korthals he points to the arrangement of the stamens; but then Korthals did not know the *Gordonia speciosa* of Ceylon which has its stamens in five distinct bundles like *G. Lasianthus*, and Pitard does; so Pitard does not find the character absolute and turns to the capsule for a supplementary one, and after it to anatomical characters.\n\n**Discontinuous distribution is by no means unusual in genera allied to Gordonia. Their demand for moisture rules their dispersion.**\n\nLike Korthals, Pitard seems to have been dominated by an idea that the discontinuous distribution requires that we should find generic characters between those plants which occur in eastern America, and those which occur in eastern Asia. It is a wrong presumption because there are several allied genera equally astride the Pacific, among those comprising the Theeae and Ternstroemieae as the reader will observe if all the genera be enumerated:\n\n- **Bonnettia**, coasts of tropical S. America.\n- **Archytaea**, coasts of the Pacific from S. America to Penang.\n- **Asteropeia**, Madagascar.\n- **Thea** (including *Camellia*), from Assam to Japan and to Java.\n- **Gordonia** (i) eastern coasts of N. America.\n  - (ii) forests of the Himalaya and S. China to Java chiefly on mountains.\n- **Haemocharis** (i) W. Indies and tropical S. America.\n  - (ii) Borneo, Java, Sumatra and Moluccas.\n- **Schima**, as Gordonia (ii).\n- **Hartia**, S.-W. China.\n- **Pyrenaria**, as Gordonia (ii).\n- **Stewartia** (*Stuartia*), (i) Mountains of eastern N. America.\n  - (ii) Japan.\n- **Ternstroemia**, (i) S. America.\n  - (ii) as Gordonia (ii).\n- **Patascoya**, north-west S. America at 10,000 feet.\n- **Anneslea**, Himalaya to the Philippine Islands.\n- **Adinandra**, (i) as Gordonia (ii).\n  - (ii) Island of St. Thom\u00e9 on the West coast of Africa.*\n- **Ternstroemiopsis**, Sandwich islands.\n- **Eurya**, (i) Mexico and the W. Indies to Venezuela.\n  - (ii) India to the Pacific.\n\n* This isolated species needs re-examination.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 76, 1917.\nFreziera, S. America.\nVismeia, Canary islands.\nTremanthera, New Guinea.\n\nAnd from such a review of the genera, allied to Gordonia, we turn with at least the suggestion that discontinuous distribution is not so rare in the order as to afford any strong reason for Korthals' and Pitard's endeavour to cut the Asiatic Gordonias from the American.\n\nIn fact what we have in the Theeae and Ternstroemieae is such a noteworthy demand for damp air as to restrict them either to damp seaboards or to mountain forests or to rain forests that are not too hot. With a centre about the Pacific, local climates have ruled where they should persist, and the discontinuous distribution is because all but a small part of North America is too dry.\n\nInstead of splitting Gordonia, it apparently should be enlarged by the inclusion of at least the Asiatic species of Haemocharis.\n\nNot only do I fail to follow the bias, but I find characters contrary to Pitard's statement that Nabiasodendron has blunt capsules and Gordonia pointed, and instead of cutting down Gordonia, I believe that Haemocharis, at least in the East is not distinguishable from it; and I recommend that the two be examined with a view to union. The only difference is in the presence of a style in Gordonia and its absence in Haemocharis, a difference which puts Gordonia singaporiana for instance on either side of the line according to the view of the moment, and prompted the remark of Koorders and Valeton in regard to Haemocharis integerrima (Mededeelingen 'S Lands Plantentuin, No. 16, 1896, p. 294) \"stilis fere dimidio leviter connatis apice obtuse divergentibus, haec species demarcationes inter genera Gordonia et Laplacea (Haemocharis) fere plane auftert,\" i.e. it comes within a trifle of breaking down the boundary.\n\nThere is one point to be set out before proceeding, namely that the Asiatic species of Haemocharis owe their position in that genus\n\nFig 2. Ovary of G. singaporiana at the time of the fall of the corolla showing how undefined in the style.\nin a very large part to Miquel. They are rare plants in herbaria, which seem to have been seldom consulted of recent years. There is consequently no concensus of modern opinion placing them where they are: and though Otto Kuntze changed the names of some, he was not working as a botanist but as a lexicographer. If the Asiatic species of *Haemocharis* be transferred to *Gordonia*, the genus is enlarged by the following:\n\n*H. vulcanica*, O. Kuntze, (*sphalm. vulcania*) being Korthals\u2019 *Laplacea vulcanica*, described in 1840 or 1841 from Mt. Meropi in Sumatra.\n\n*H. marginata*, O. Kuntze, first described in the same place as *Closaschima marginata*, from Mt. Tirin and from near Martapura in Borneo.\n\n*H. ovalis*, O. Kuntze, first described along with the last two as *Closaschima ovalis* from the forests of Melintang in Sumatra.\n\n*H. buxifolia*, Szyszylowicz, first described by Miquel as *Laplacea buxifolia* in 1862 in his *Sumatra, zijne Plantenwereld* p. 482, from Paya Kombo in Western Sumatra.\n\n*H. aromatica*, Szyszylowicz, first described by Miquel along with the last from Mangala in the Lampongs province, and also from Priaman, in Sumatra.\n\n*H. subintegerrima* first described by Miquel along with the last two, from Kobu-lahat in the Province of Palembang, Sumatra.\n\n*H. integerrima*, Koorders and Vleton, first described by Miquel in the *Annales Musei botanici Lugduno-Batavi*, iv. 1869, from Preanger in West Java.\n\n*H. amboinensis* first described as *Laplacea amboinensis* by Miquel in the same place as the last.\n\n*H. serrata*, Koorders and Vleton, described in *Mededeelingen van 's Lands Plantentuin*, No. 16, 1896, p. 296.\n\nOf the genus Miquel remarks that it descends to low levels (*Sumatra, zijne Plantenwereld*, p. 483), but not in Java. So too does *Gordonia* descend to low levels in the Malay Peninsula, but not in India and Ceylon.\n\n**Size attained by Gordonia.**\n\nThe home of the American species of *Gordonia* is swampy hollows among the pines of the Pine barrens along the sea coast. The home of all the eastern species as far as recorded is sloping ground in dense rain forests and often on the crests of the ridges in these forests. On such crests the trees are apt to be dwarfed by conditions, and it is almost certain that foresters will soon show that the botanists who have described the plants have by far understated the sizes attained by many of the species. These are the sizes so far recorded:\n\n*G. Welborni* attains 50 meters or 160 feet.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 76, 1917.\nG. singaporiana 43 meters or 120 feet.\nG. excelsa 25 meters or 80 feet.\nG. Lasianthus 24 meters or 75 feet.\nG. obtusa 20 meters or 60 feet, or perhaps more.\nG. multinervis\nG. Lobbii\nG. speciosa\nG. penangensis\nG. Maingayi\nG. sinensis\nG. luzonica (G. fragrans)\nG. Balansae\nG. pubescens\nG. brevifolia 4 meters or 14 feet.\n\nRidley in the *Journal of the Federated Malay States Museums*, iv, 1909, p. 6, speaks of very large Gordonias occurring on the upper ridges of the Telom district of Pahang. The species was not determined.\n\nBut unfortunately so many of these species are known from observation in but one or two localities, and again we know that flowering is no criterion of age, as in European gardens G. Lasianthus will flower at 8\u201410 feet, G. pubescens at 4\u20146 feet, and G. axillaris at 3 feet (see Nicholson's *Gardener's Dictionary* article Gordonia): and we know also that the first named may be reduced by conditions in its own home to a bush (see Sargent, *Manual of the trees of N. America*, 1905, p. 678). G. singaporiana also flowers as a bush. Almost all from the economic point of view are inadequately known.\n\nThere are no records of the rate of the growth of the eastern Gordonias. Tree No. 1505 V. in the Botanic Gardens, Singapore,\u2014Gordonia singaporiana,\u2014is now 145 cm, in circumference at 130 cm. from the ground; and this dimension is here recorded that some observer in the future may measure it again. Its height may be, about 70 feet, and it branches high; but tree 1508 H, which is in the open, branches low down.\n\n**The Timber.**\n\nThe timber of Gordonia Lasianthus is stated by Sargent to be light, soft, close-grained, not durable, light red.......occasionally used in cabinet making.\n\nThe wood of the eastern species finds a perhaps greater appreciation. Beddome (*Flora Sylvatica*, 1874, under t. 83) wrote of G. obtusa that the wood is \u201cwhite with a straw tint, even grained and pleasant to work, not unlike beech; very generally used for planks, doors, rafters and beams, but warps if not well seasoned.\u201d In the *Indian Forester* ii, 1876, p. 23, while stating that the timbers in the sholas or woods of the Nilgiri plateau are of less value\nthan those of the slopes, he named *Gordonia obtusa* with seven others, as being chiefly in use. Gamble, *Flora of Madras*, i, 1915, p. 80, says, wood reddish, hard, and close grained, but little used. Trimen recorded of the Ceylon *G. zeylanica* (*Handbook of the Flora of Ceylon*, i, 1893, p. 111) \"wood red, smooth, hard, shining\" and after this he adds words which imply that the carpenters up country in Ceylon are familiar with the use of it. Ridley quoting Maingay, (*Agricultural Bulletin of the Straits and Federated Malay States*, i, 1901, p. 48) wrote of the Malayan *G. excelsa*, (but Maingay though doubtless referring to a *Gordonia* may not have had *G. excelsa* before him), \"Wood pale red, fine to medium grain, good for houses, beams and boats. Weight 59 lbs. 5\u00be oz. and 65 lbs. 7\u00bd oz.\" De Sturler, (*Cat. Descript des esp\u00e8ces de Bois de l'Archipel des Indes Orientales*, 1867, p. 16) stated that a *Gordonia* of W. Java* furnishes a reddish brown wood of great density employed by carpenters; and that it works well. On p. 36 under the name of Aylapia, he stated that a *Gordonia* of Amboyna gave a reddish wood, used but not durable.\n\nCantley's collector in Malacca in 1886 obtained *G. singaporiana* with the note that the timber is used in house building and is durable. The same in 1885 noted of what appears to be *G. hirtella* that the wood is a dirty dark colour, and its heart black, that it sinks in water and is used for house posts being very durable for this purpose.\n\nElmer while giving no uses for *G. Welborni* describes the wood as \"hard, somewhat burly,........and reddish.\"\n\nMoll and Janssonius (*Mikrographie des Holtzes der auf Java vorkommender Baumarten*, 1906, p. 334) described the structure of the wood of *G. excelsa*, from Koorders' material; and on p. 338 they described the wood of *Haemocharis integerrima*.\n\nWhitford (*Forests of the Philippines*, part ii, 1911, p. 59) states that *Gordonia luzonica* is of no importance to the lumberman.\n\n**The Foliage.**\n\nAll the Gordonias are evergreen. Foliation in *G. singaporiana* occurs in flushes of about four leaves generally of increasing size, and the next leaf is small again, but the last leaf may be small especially if it subtends a flower; and leaves at various points may also be small subtending flowers. The leaves persist over more than a year, and there may perhaps be two flushes in the twelve months. At the top of the forest their length may be 15 cm., but young trees in shade carry leaves as much as 35 cm. long, by 10 cm. in breadth.\n\nAlong the margins of the leaves of *Gordonia*, when expanded, little blackish bodies may be seen, which if the leaf has teeth are on their apices, but are not absent if the teeth be so. These are\n\n---\n\n* This is more likely to be *Haemocharis integerrima* than *Gordonia excelsa*. Both have the same vernacular name\u2014Kimandjel.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 76, 1917.\nmucilage glands, whose function is to keep the young tissues from injury while still packed in the bud. When the leaves expand, they are already dead in the Asiatic species but I have seen them to be still alive on young expanded leaves of the American *G. pubescens*, and perhaps their structure differs. It is interesting to link this protective function with the demand that the tree makes for moist air. A little nerve runs out to the glands. This same type of gland occurs in allied genera such as *Adinandra*, as in *Gordonia imbricata* and *G. Scortechinii*, where the leaves are toothless. The apex to the leaf also is glandular, and dies as or before the leaf unfolds, often leaving an emargination. Some of the earlier botanists have tried to make a character of this emargination, but the degree to which it has gone in any particular leaf may be but a response to local or to temporary air conditions. Reference may be made to fig. 15, on p. 158, where two flushes are represented. At the commencement of the first, weather conditions appear to have been such as to destroy with the apical gland quite a distinct piece of the neighbouring tissues; these conditions were not repeated. Hairs are present on the young parts which vanish like the glands more or less completely with age: in the leaf bud they are protective similarly. They afford no good specific characters.\n\n**The Flowers.**\n\nFlowers are formed on very short axillary shoots in the upper leaf axils of a flush or in the axils of cataphyllary leaves following. If the terminal bud should die they appear as if terminal on the foliar branches, and this seems particularly to happen in *G. penangensis*. In this species the weight of a falsely terminal capsule on the rather slender branchlets makes it to hang; but in most species they dehisce upwards, see fig. 7 of *G. hirtella*.\n\nThe Gordonias, as said, may be got to flower at relatively small sizes. No information is available as to subsequent seed-formation; but in Singapore *G. singaporiana* already seeds at a height of 6 meters.\n\nNo information is available as to the formation of flowers in *Gordonia* sexually imperfect, except that a female condition was found in the first observed plant of *G. axillaris*. However as Urban (*Berichte d. deutsch. bot. Gesellschaft*, xiv, 1896, p. 51) has found male and female flowers in the Tropical American species of *Haemocharis*, the occurrence of sexually imperfect flowers in a *Gordonia* is hardly isolated. Further Urban ascribes to the male flower a short style, which makes the definition between *Gordonia* and *Haemocharis* just nothing.\n\nThe old trees of *G. singaporiana* in the Botanic Gardens, Singapore, have their flowers fully hermaphrodite. They open in the evening or after dark, facing horizontally or slightly downwards, and fall during the next forenoon. They have a smell which is fairly strong, but hardly fragrant; they are in colour creamy white: they are produced over many months of the year. Infertile\nflowers perish in the horizontal position of flowering; fertile capsules however resume a more or less upright position and the mature capsule dehisces on the tree facing more or less upwards. It is hygroscopic, closing slowly if wetted and opening slowly again when dried. The walls of the loculi fit over the seeds very closely so that these escape with difficulty, and it is quite common for the capsule to fall to the bottom of the forest with them still enclosed.\n\nThe Seed and Seedling.\n\nThe germination of *G. singaporiana* has been watched. In it the seed coats are split along the longer free margin of the seed and the radicle is extruded. When this has anchored the cotyledons are raised up and with them the seed coats, from which they escape in consequence of their efforts to attain a more or less horizontal position.\n\nThe cotyledons are somewhat arched, and are without the mucilage-glands of the later foliage. With our present scant knowledge of the species of *Gordonia* the characters of the foliage help us more than anything else to a scheme of classification, probably in no way because they are the best, but because we know too little about the capsules. As regards the latter not only do we suffer from the circumstance that from many of the species they have not been collected yet, but also from the fact that the differences in them are difficult to bring out in descriptions unaccompanied by drawings. Towards a remedy the following line blocks may do a little. The next proceeding towards understanding the genus, apart from the collecting of more material, is a re-examination of the Sumatran and Bornean types in Dutch herbaria.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 76, 1917.\nThe known species of Gordonia and the Asiatic species of Haemocharis.\n\nThe most outstanding species of the whole genus is the North American *G. pubescens*. The following enumeration will be started with it.\n\n**Gordonia pubescens**, L'H\u00e9ritier, Stirpes novae, 1784, p. 156. *G. Altamaha*, Sargent, Manual Trees, N. America, 1905, p. 679.\n\nThis species used to be found on the Altamaha river in Georgia but has long been extinct in a wild state. Its leaves have a conspicuous venation. Its flowers are 8 cm. in diameter on short peduncles. Its stamens are inserted separately, and their length relative to the size of the flower is small. The ovary is \"truncate and crowned with a slender deciduous style nearly as long as the stamens.\" The capsule is globose and septicidal from the base. Its seeds are very characteristic, sharply defining it from all other Gordonias: for they are wingless.\n\nThere is a line figure of it in Sargent's book.\n\n**G. Lasianthus**, Linnaeus, Mantissa 1771, ii. 570: Sargent, Manual Trees, N. America, 1905, p. 678: in foliar characters lies close to the above: the venation is distinct. The flowers are on long peduncles slender below, but thickening to the flower: they are 6-8 cm. in diameter, white, and with the relatively short stamens united into five bundles at their insertion. The ovary is \"gradually contracted into the stout style.\" The capsule is ovoid and the seeds are winged. Its distribution is from Maryland all along the pine barrens of the Atlantic coast into the Gulf of Texas to the mouths of the Mississippi.\n\nSargent gives a line figure of it.\n\n**Gordonia sinensis**, Hemsley and E. H. Wilson, in Kew Bull. 1906, p. 153, is described by the authors as of Asiatic Gordonias the most nearly allied to the American species. It has leaves with veins prominent on both surfaces. The white flowers are described as about 5 to 6.5 cm. in diameter. But its capsule is unknown. The petiole is up to 1.5 cm. long. The stigma is said to be \"capitate.\"\n\nMr. E. H. Wilson got it in the forests of Mt. Omi, Szechuen, Western China.\n\n**G. penangensis**, Ridley, in Journ. Straits Branch, Roy. Asiatic Soc., No. 73, 1916, p. 142: *G. excelsa*, King, in Journ. Asiatic Soc. Bengal, lix, 1890, p. 203, not of Blume.\n\nThis species is noteworthy for the slenderness of its branchlets which so bend under the weight of the capsules as to make\nthem pendulous. Its leaves are rather small and the petioles for\n\nFig. 4. Foliage and flower of *G. penangensis*, reduced to $\\frac{1}{3}$, from Curtis 834.\n\nFig. 5. Capsule of *G. penangensis* nat. size, from Curtis 834.\n\nthe genus longish. A little hair persists at maturity on the backs of the blades near to the midrib. Its flowers are 3 cm. in diameter and are described by Curtis as yellow and by Ridley as pinkish yellow. The ovary narrows into a long style. Curtis got it as a medium sized tree at 1,500 and 2,400 feet in Penang island. Ridley as a tall tree at about sea level at Seletar and at Chanchukang in Singapore island. It is to be noted that Pitard's character of blunt capsules for *Nabiasodendron* is not upheld by this species.\n\n**G. Maingayi**, King, in Journ. Asiatic Soc. Bengal, lix, 1890, p. 204, is extremely near to *G. penangensis*: and the ovary narrows in the same way into the style.\n\nIt was obtained first by Maingay who collected in Malacca, and then by Scortechini and Wray who collected largely in the hills near Taiping but did not record their localities. I have not seen Maingay's plant.\n\n**G. taipingensis**, one of the new species here described, has large leaves and large flowers. In outline the leaves agree with those of *G. penangensis*.\n\nFig. 6. Leaf and bud of *G. taipingensis*, reduced to $\\frac{1}{5}$, from the type specimen R. A. Soc., No. 76, 1917.\nGordonia taipingensis, Arbor, 40-vel 50-pedalis, cortice avellaneo-umbrina.

G. obtusifolia, Wight, loc. cit.\n\nThis is clearly near to G. Maingayi, as Sir William Thiselton-Dyer pointed out. The flowers are larger and the leaves harsher. The colour of the flowers is creamy white and their diameter about 7.5 cm. The ovary is represented as narrowing into the style, and the style as being tubular almost to the top of the ovary. Sometimes the stigma is 4-lobed. It is a common tree in the little patches of forests which occur in the ravines of the Nilgiri hills chiefly on the eastern side, between 5,000 and 7,000 feet. From the Nilgiri hills it extends southwards and reaches lower levels on the damp western face of the Travancore slopes: also it reaches the Bababuden hills in Mysore.\n\nWight gave the name G. parvifolia to a plant which he obtained in Courtallum with smaller leaves and their margins almost toothless, but later botanists who have had a right to an opinion, have considered it as not distinct from G. obtusa.\n\nFig. 7.' Capsule of G. hirtella, slightly reduced, from Ridley 7350.\nG. hirtella, Ridley, in Journ. Straits Branch, Roy. Asiatic Soc., No. 73, 1916, p. 142, has foliage like that of G. taipingensis, but is widely different in its smaller flowers (only 2 cm. in diameter) and smaller leaves (up to 14 cm. in length). The capsules of G. taipingensis being unknown, the comparison cannot proceed to them, but in G. hirtella as the drawing shows they are small and the lobes after dehiscence are finger-like. The ovary narrows gradually into the style.\n\nG. hirtella occurs on the Central Chain of mountains of the Malay Peninsula from Gunong Batu Puteh in Perak to the west of Tapah, where Wray got it at his lower camp (Wray No. 116) through Bukit Kutu in Selangor at 3,000 feet, (Ridley 7350) to Bukit Etam at the same height (Kelsall 1848) on the Selangor-Negri Sembilan boundary. Further there is a specimen which appears to be it in the Singapore herbarium collected for Cantley (No. 1296) at \u201cKandong\u201d by which name is probably indicated the Kendong in Negri Sembilan lying close to the foot of Gunong Tampin. Cantley\u2019s collector stated that the heartwood is black, and the albumen dark in colour, and that it makes very durable house posts.\n\nThe flowers are creamy white.\n\nG. tonkinensis, Pitard, in Lecompte, Flore g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l\u2019Indo-Chine, i. 1910, p. 348, by the description appears to lie near this place in the sequence. Its elliptic leaves attain 13 cm. in length, and have small crenulations sometimes towards the apex. They have a petiole up to 1 cm. in length, and the venation is almost totally obscured by the coriaceousness of the leaf-blade. Pitard gives a figure of the small capsule, which in shape is not unlike the unexpanded capsule of G. hirtella, but from his description is yet smaller by one third.\n\nThe flowers are unknown. Abb\u00e9 Bon collected it near Ninh binh in Tonkin, i.e., not far from the coast.\n\nG. luzonica, Vidal, Revis. Pl. Vasc. Filip., 1886, p. 57. G. fragrans, Merrill, in Philippine Journ. Science, i. Suppl. 1906, p. 95.\n\nFig. 8. leaf of G. luzonica, reduced to \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) from Borden 809.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 76, 1917.\nWith this species we begin distinctly to approach those where the petiole is scarcely present; Merrill in describing it gives the length as 5 mm. or less. The blades of the leaves are oblong lanceolate, the broadest part being not yet carried above the mid length: the margins have obscure crenations in the upper part: the nerves are not so obscure as in many species, the degree being much as in G. hirtella. The white flowers are fairly large (5 cm. in diameter), and are fragrant. The ovary is oblong-ovoid. The capsule in shape is very like that of the G. lanceifolia figured below, and is described as 3 cm. long.\n\nG. luzonica appears to be not uncommon on the mountains not remote from Manila bay.\n\nI have before me a specimen from Baguio in the Province of Benguet, Luzon, (Curran 5083) which in its foliage and capsules appears to be distinct from G. luzonica. The leaves carry a large amount of hair, and are broader than those of G. luzonica: the capsules are 4 cm. long and so larger. The Baguio country is a country of ravines with at the best scrubby forest and without the true rain forests in which G. luzonica lives usually. It is true that G. obtusa occupies somewhat similar ravines in the Nilgiri hills as well as places in the rain forests towards the Arabian Sea, so that the different situation is no base for a case; but the different appearance of the specimen calls for an examination of more material.\n\nG. Welborni, Elmer, Leaflets of Philippine Botany, ii. 1908, p. 501, appears like an exaggeration of G. luzonica. It is described as the largest in growth of all the Gordonias (30 to 50 metres in height), with a straight trunk a metre thick. The leaves attain a length of 15 cm., which is not larger than those of G. luzonica, nor are they relatively wider, but the flowers have petals 3 to 4 cm. long so that their diameter must be 8 cm. The stamens however are described as relatively short. It is to be inferred from the description that the ovary contracts to the style. The flowers are creamy white.\n\nElmer got this species in the island of Negros in the Cuernes mountains at Dumaguete, and he records that Mrs. Clemens had found it at 4250 feet in the Lanao region of central Mindanao.\n\nG. lanceifolia, a new species, comes near to G. luzonica. It has leaves of the same outline but more nearly entire, and differently veined. Its capsules terminate leafless branchlets which may be 4 cm. long. It occurs in Borneo near Kuching.\n\nGordonia lanceifolia. Arbor sempervirens. Rami ultimi pennae corvinae crassi, siccitate nigricantes, glaberrimi. Alabastra externe glaberrima.

Leaves of *G. lanceifolia* reduced to $\\frac{1}{8}$, and capsule, natural size, from the type specimen.\n\n**Haemocharis integerrima**, Koorders and Valeton, has leaves in shape like those of *G. lanceifolia*, but thicker, with the veins obscured. It occurs in the mountains throughout Java between 2,400 and 7,000 feet.\n\n**H. serrata**, Koorders and Valeton, is contrasted by the authors with the above, and said to differ in its more prominent serrations near its leaf apex, its larger flowers, and hairy style (sic!). It was obtained on Gunong Pulasari in Java.\n\n**Haemocharis aromatica**, though said to be near *H. vulcanica*, by Miquel, possesses a less marked montane appearance. Its leaves are very minutely subcallously serrulate and have veins which can be traced by being depressed above. No statement is made of the absence of style. If a *Gordonia* the description appears to place it here.\n\nIt was got in two varieties in Western and Southern Sumatra.\n\n**G. Balansae**, Pilard, in Lecompte, Flore G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l'Indo-Chine, i. 1910, p. 348, is described as having leaves elliptic to\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 76, 1917.\noblanceolate, dentate, coriaceous, and so small as to be only 5 to 10 cm. long by 1.5 to 3.5 cm broad. The dentation removes the species from the neighbourhood of the small leaved Malayan species with which this enumeration will end. At the same time the petiole for the smallness of the blade is rather long (up to 8 mm.). The flowers are yellowish, and apparently about 3 cm. across. The ovary is of three loculi only, and is contracted into the style. The capsule is represented by Pitard as oblique. If this curious condition is at all constant it is very interesting, and a relationship of some closeness to *G. anomala* is suggested thereby.\n\n*G. Balansae* was collected in the forests of Mount Bavi in Tonkin near to the village of Sougi by the collector Balansa.\n\n*G. axillaris*, D. Dietrich, Syn.

Mag. 1843, plate 4019.\n\nThis species with elliptic toothed leaves, and a short but distinct petiole, has an ovary which may be made of four or of five carpels. In this perhaps is an indication of affinity to *G. Balansae*. Its flowers are white, and large (6 to 7 cm. in diameter: or according to the Gardener's Chronicle, lxi. p. 250, the flowers recently produced at Kew, 12 cm.). The ovary contracts to the style.\n\nBentham supposed the plant confined to the island of Hongkong, as he was unable to ascertain any record of its occurrence on the mainland of China.\n\nMatsumura and Hayata, have recorded it from two places in the extreme north of Formosa and from one very near the middle of the island. The old errors of placing its home in Penang should have been forgotten by now, but persist; and Singapore is added equally incorrectly.\n\n*G. concentricicatrix*, a new species from the lowlands between the Dindings and Malacca, is the first of two in which the broadest part of the leaf is very markedly towards the apex. It occurs as a big tree in the Selangor forests with a clean straight trunk marked by concentric rings which it is hoped to figure later.\nGordonia concentricicatrix.

Indigenae ad Rantau Panjang Kelat merah vocant, sed ad Brisu Samak pulut.\n\nIt is to be enquired if Haemocharis marginata (Korth.) O. Kuntze, is not of this affinity. Its leaves are described as oblong-oval or oblong-obovate and though put into Closaschima by the author the style is described by him as \u201c5-angled, 5-grooved, silky and short\u201d which fits such an admitted Gordonia as G. singaporiana excellently. It was obtained from Mt. Tirin and from Matapura in Borneo.\n\nHaemocharis subintegerrima, has leaves lanceolate oblong to obovate oblong. As in the case of the above the mention of obovateness suggests a place near to Gordonia concentricicatrix but its veins are obscured, and the marginal teeth nearly\nobsolete. Kurz says that it hardly differs from *II. aromatica*, and is the same as *Gordonia Maingayi*, which appears dubious. It was obtained in Sumatra at Kobu-lahat in the Province of Palembang.\n\n**G. multinervis**, King, in Journ. Asiatic Soc. Bengal, lix, 1890, p. 205, ends the series to which it belongs, being peculiar in the great size of its leaves. It has been collected in Perak and in Singapore. As the attached figure shows the veins in the leaf-blade are not inconspicuous, a feature shared with *G. concentricicatrix*. The flowers are only a little over 2 cm. in diameter and agree with those of *G. concentricicatrix*. Sir George King called attention to the resemblance of its leaves to those of the genus *Pyrenaria*.\n\n![Fig. 11. A leaf of G. multinervis, reduced to 1/5, from Ridley 6367](image)\n\n**G. singaporiana**, Wallich, Cat. Lith., 1832, No. 1457, name only; Ridley in Journ. Straits Branch, Roy. Asiatic Soc., No. 73, 1916, p. 141: *G. excelsa*, var. *sincapuriana*, Dyer in Hooker fil., Flora Brit. Ind. i. 1872, p. 291: *G. grandis*, King, in Journ. Asiatic Soc. Bengal, lix, 1890, p. 203, non Andr\u00e9. In this species the petiole is almost absent, and the leaf blade very nearly entire. In its subsessile leaves it is easily distinguished from all other Malayan species, but in Ceylon we find allied trees with such leaves. The flowers which are 3 cm. across, have been figured above (p. 133), and the ovary with its abbreviated style (p. 140); the leaf and a capsule are figured below. Kurz saw that it is not Blume\u2019s plant, but misidentified it with *Gordonia axillaris*.\n\nIt occurs in Singapore island, in Johore, in Malacca, and in Penang.\nG. dipterosperma, Kurz, in Journ. Asiatic Soc. Bengal, xlv, 1876, p. 119: G. excelsa var. pubescens, Dyer in Hooker fil., Flora Brit. India, i. 1873, p. 291: Gordonia sp., Griffith, Posthumous-papers, ii. p. 99 and iii, p. 200: Dipterosperma sp., Griffith, Notulae, iv. 1854, p. 564.\n\nIt appears right to separate this from G. excelsa, as Kurz did. Kurz wrote \"Blume's tree differs so much from the above in the long peduncles, large hirsute capsules, and in the texture and pubescence of the leaves, that it is difficult to understand how it could have come to be identified with the Khasi and Sikkim tree.\" Ridley (in this Journal No. 73, p. 142) has called attention to the large pustules from which the hairs spring on the backs of the leaves. It was collected first by Griffith at Dewangiri where he entered what is now Bhutan, and then afterwards in the Khasi hills by Kurz. Mr. C. C. Calder, Curator of the Herbarium of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Calcutta, has been so good as to refer to all the material that he possesses and to tell me that it has been obtained in additional localities in British Sikkim.\n\nG. excelsa, Blume, Bijdragen, iii. 1826, p. 130: Koorders and Vareton in Mededeelingen 'sLands Plantentuin, No. 16, 1896, p. 289: Koorders, Excursionsflora von Java, ii. 1912, p. 608: Koorders-Schumacher, Systemat. Verzeichnis, fam. 180, p. 35. Antheeischima excelsa, Korthals, Verh. Nat. Gesch. 1839-42, 138, t. 27.\n\nKoorders points out that the margin of the leaves varies considerably, being toothed sometimes and sometimes not toothed. The flowers, Ridley points out, are twice as large as those of G. singaporiana. Koorders describes the appearance of the tree as characteristic, the young stem up to 50 cm. in diameter having a peculiar thin sloughing \"brown-red-grey\" bark. G. excelsa was obtained by Blume in the mountains of Western Java; it was obtained by Koorders on Gunong Salak in Western Java and in the Pantjur-Idjen region of East Java.\n\nR. A.

India, i. 1873, p. 291: Trimen, Handbook Flora Ceylon, i. 1893, p. 110.\n\nThe almost sessile oval or oblong lanceolate leaves of this species distinctly suggest G. singaporiana, but they are shorter, firmer and the margins are markedly revolute often. Its white flowers are large, being 7.5 cm. in diameter. The capsules are rather over 3 cm. long. It occurs in many places about the mountains in the centre of Ceylon between 4,000 and 7,000 feet.\n\nG. elliptica, Gardner, in Calcutta, Journ. Nat. Hist., vii. 1846, p. 448, is regarded by Trimen as a variety of G. zeylanica with shorter leaves and larger flowers. It occurs at one place in the same region as G. zeylanica.\n\nG. speciosa, Choisy in M\u00e9moires de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Physique de Gen\u00e8ve, xiv. 1855, p. 52: Thwaites, Enum.

Hist., vii, 1846, p. 7.\n\nBy its large deep crimson flowers this is a most outstanding species. Its long ovate leaves are almost sessile or even sessile: they are entire and the margin often revolute. The flowers are nearly 10 cm. in diameter, and its capsules nearly 5 cm. long. The stamens are united into five groups.\n\nIt formerly occurred gregariously in the forest above Rambodde in Ceylon at about 4,000 feet, where clearing has been extensive and made it very rare.\n\nG. Lobbii, Hooker fil., in Trans. Linn. Soc. London, xxiii, 1860, p. 162, may be taken conveniently as the first of the last group of the genus, a group made of species with relatively small leaves whose margins are even and whose general facies suggests ability to withstand adverse conditions. It is a small or medium sized tree, with elliptic harsh entire leaves attaining 9 cm. in length, and 5 cm. in width. The expanded flower is only 2 cm. in diameter. The ovary is described as globose. It was collected by Lobb \u201cad Sarawak\u201d which would mean near Kuching.\n\nG. Havilandii, a new species, comes very near to G. Lobbii, and was obtained near Kuching. It differs in its petioles and its filaments, points which on further study may be found perhaps not worthy of the stress laid on them here. But until we have ob-\ntained the material needed for bridging the differences, they must be recognised.\n\nFigure 14. A leaf of *G. Havilandii* reduced to \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) from Haviland 67.\n\n**Gordonia Havilandii.** *Frutex vel arbor, cortice ramolorum avellaneus. Ramuli ultimi 3 mm. diametro.

Kuntze,* is described as if extremely like the last two species. It has oval or ovate-entire leaves of a similar size. But the description states that the stamens are sometimes in five groups, as in *G. speciosa* and the American *G. Lasianthus.* The ovary is described as ovoid which indicates a narrowing upwards to the five subconnate styles. Surely it is a good *Gordonia!* It was obtained on Mount Merapi in Sumatra.\n\n**G. imbricata,** *King,* in Journ. Asiatic Soc. Bengal, lix, 1890, p. 204, has a distinctly xerophytic appearance. Two flushes of its foliage are figured below. The leaves are seen to be small and entire. They are harsh and thick with the margins slightly revolute. The flowers are only 2.5 cm. in diameter. The ovary\nnarrows into the style. It occurs on the mountains of Pahang, both on Gunong Tahan and Gunong Benom at Kluang Terbang.\n\nFigure 15. A branch of *G. imbricata* showing two flushes, a. a. the periodic reduced leaves, reduced to $\\frac{1}{4}$ from Ridley, 16021.\n\n**G. Scortechinii**, *King*, in Journ. Asiatic Soc., Bengal, lix, 1890, p. 24, might be described as *G. imbricata* with an admixture of *G. Maingayi*. Its branches however are more slender than in the first of these two and its flowers are recorded as remarkably small, the stamens being no more than 30. The locality whence it was obtained is unrecorded except as \u201cPerak.\u201d\n\n**G. brevifolia**, *Hooker fil.*, in Trans. Linn. Soc. London, xxiii, 1860, p. 162, is obviously a close ally of the last two. Its leaves are broadly ovate to obovate, with the condition of the apex varying. Its flowers are large, being nearly 4 cm. across. It was obtained on Mount Kinabalu in Borneo at about 8,000 feet.\n\n**Haemocharis buxifolia**, *Szyszylowicz*, appears to be one of this set of Gordonias, and the type specimen should be re-examined with this view. It was obtained in western Sumatra at Paya Komba.\n\n**Haemocharis ovalis**, (Korth.) O. Kuntze, is the only species of which it is clearly said that the style is indistinguishable: \u201cStylus haud manifestus\u201d are Korthals words: which together with his further statement \u201covarium ovoideum, apice truncatum\u201d do indicate such a condition as is in the American *Haemocharis*.\n\nOn this account I do not attempt to find a place for it among the species of *Gordonia*, but put it at the end. Its leaves are described as much smaller than the species around *G. luzonica* (7 cm. long by 2 cm. broad); but they are serrulate or crenate, and therefore not as those ending the series such as *G. imbricata*.\n\nIt was obtained in the forests of Melintang in Sumatra.\n\nNo attempt is possible at placing **Haemocharis amboinensis**.\nOutstanding features in the genus are:\n\ni. the septifragal capsule of *G. pubescens*.\n\nii. the wingless seeds of *G. pubescens*.\n\niii. the deep crimson colour of the flowers of *G. speciosa*.\n\niv. the union of the filaments into five groups in *G.

H. Burkill.\n\nFruit of *Shorea leprosula*, slightly reduced: and the dehisced capsule showing the sterilised loculi forming a partial septum intruding into the fertile loculus.\n\nThe ovary of Shorea has three loculi, and in each loculus are two ovules. But of the six thus presented in each flower, usually one only matures into a seed. As this one grows, it with its loculus extends round the central placentas, ending in wrapping within itself the two sterilised loculi. At seed-fall all endosperm has gone, and it is the fleshy inner cotyledon which does this wrapping. The radicle of the embryo is directed towards the apex of the loculus. Figure 2 is the embryo of *Shorea leprosula*, Miq., seen from the basal end of the loculus, showing how the two cotyledons lie doubled round the placentas (pl.) one being outside the other.\n\nThe figures here reproduced have all been drawn with the aid of a camera, and are proportionately accurate.\n\nJour. Straits Branch R. A. Soc., No. 76, 1917.\nFigure 2. The embryo \u00d7 3 (from the basal end of the fruit :) pl. placenta; cot. i. inner cotyledon; cot. o. outer cotyledon.\n\nFigs. 3 and 4. Fig. 3 (above) the embryo is section near the rounded end of the seed; Fig. 4, (below) the same toward the pointed end.\n\nThe outer cotyledon (cot. o.) when seen from this point of view, appears to be very much less bulky than the inner and is indeed a little less bulky. Each is two-lobed (see fig. 8), these lobes being packed in the seed in the upper half of the loculus, where they surround the radicle.\n\nOn cutting the embryo transversely near to the end which is represented in figure 2, the two cotyledons are seen doubled round the placenta as in figure 3. But when we take a transverse section towards the other end, we get their lobes in section surrounding the radicle and hypocotyl as in figure 4, the two lobes of the inner cotyledon embracing the placenta.\n\nAt maturity when the shuttle-cock-like seed falls, spinning into the sparse herbage and leaves on the floor of the forest, the embryo plant is full of chlorophyll and in such a state that it must germinate without delay or die. By reason of the way in which it falls, there is a considerable probability that it comes to rest with the radicle directed upper-most, and a certainty that it will not be directed downwards. The seed germinates; the cotyledons by growth and in straightening themselves rupture the thin ovary wall and seed coats, not along two constant lines but along two lines from top to base on opposite sides, generally rather more than 180\u00b0 removed from each other on the side of the partial septum, so that this portion of the husk is rather larger than the other: then the hypocotyl elongates and curves to direct the radicle into the soil (fig. 5); if the radicle succeeds in anchoring, a tendency in the hypocotyl to straighten itself which now succeeds to the other, pulls the cotyledons from the loosely imprisoning fruit-walls, and the stage which is seen in figure 6 passes over to that seen in...\nfigure 7. If there happens a most unlikely occurrence in nature,\u2014that the cotyledons cannot be pulled out, and the root does not hold, the latter by the straightening of the hypocotyl is raised up into the air, and held.\n\nThe cotyledons at this time move so as to become nearly horizontal and stand thus unless as not seldom happens their lobes engage, when they remain face to face as figure 6 indicates.\n\nFigs. 5 and 6, Shorea leprosula the root being placed in the earth.\n\nA glance at figure 4 shows than any impression of the placentas will be on the lower surface of the inner cotyledon only, but that impressions of the radicle may be on the lobes of both. In figure 5 the impression of the placentas is seen crossing the lobes of the inner cotyledon: and in figure 8 the impression of the radicle may be observed.\n\nFig. 7. Shorea leprosula, reduced to \u00bd, at the expanding of the first leaves,\n\nFigure 6 shows that the outer cotyledon retains more of its humped shape than does the inner cotyledon: and it is the straightening of the inner cotyledon which more than anything else appears to burst the fruit wall,\u2014an interesting slight differentiation of function.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 76, 1917.\nFig. 8. The cotyledon of *Shorea leprosula* from above, \u00d7 1\u00bd.\n\nAt the stage reached in figure 7 the first pair of leaves are ready to expand: and at this stage the heliotropism exhibited by the young plant is considerable. The plant figured had been illuminated from one side only.\n\nIt will be noticed in figure 7 that one cotyledon is raised by its petiole to a position slightly higher than that of the other; that one is the outer: and the different angle which it tends to take, may be connected with its greater bulk and less ability to flatten itself. The outer cotyledon stands higher than the inner also in other Shoreas.\n\nFigure 9 is of *S. rigida*, Brandis, with the outer cotyledon to the left. Figs. 10 and 11 are of *S. macroptera*, Dyer, with the same orientation. Figure 12 is of *S. bracteolata*, Dyer, with the outer cotyledon on the opposite side. In all the outer cotyledon has taken up a position above the inner.\n\nFig. 9. Cotyledons of *Shorea rigida*. Fig. 10. Cotyledons of *Shorea macroptera* from above and from the side.\n\nThis outer cotyledon is least bulky in *S. bracteolata*, and most bulky in *S. macroptera*. The drawings indicate differences in shape: but until many more Shoreas have been examined in the seedling state, it is useless to endeavour to establish relationships between their shape and the sections of the genus.\nFig. 11. A young plant of *Shorea macroptera* at the expanding of the first leaves.\n\nFig. 12. A young plant of *Shorea bracteolata* and its cotyledons, both from above and the inner from below.\n\nFig. 13. A young plant of *Shorea gibbosa*.\nAll of these Shoreas, e.g. *S. leprosula*, *S. rigida*, *S. macroptera*, and *S. bracteolata*, have epigeal cotyledons with short petioles; but the Indian *S. robusta*, Roxb., differs greatly from them in having cotyledons capable of being hypogeal, with greatly elongating petioles, in which characters it approaches *Dipterocarpus*.\n\nIn the Botanic Gardens, Singapore, where *S. macroptera* is particularly abundant, many abnormal seedlings appeared in 1916. Some of these had three cotyledons, followed by three leaves in a whorl: some had three cotyledons followed by what may be called two and a half leaves (fig. 15) or by three and a half leaves (figure 16); and sometimes abnormally split leaves would follow the normal number of cotyledons (fig. 17). Notice was particularly taken of these in the wish to ascertain how *Anisoptera* (see this Journal p. 44) has a whorl of four leaves following the cotyledons.\nFigs. 14, 15, 16, 17. Abnormal seedlings of *Shorea macroptera*.\n\nThe period from flowering to seed fall in the Shoreas, all except *S. bracteolata* being wild in the Botanic gardens, is about ten weeks in the case of *S. leprosula*, *S. rigida*, *S. macroptera* and *S. pauciflora*, about nine weeks in the case of *S. bracteolata* and *S. gibbosa*.\n\n*S. gratissima*, Dyer, which in addition to those just named also occurs wild in the Botanic gardens, flowered in 1915 in three trees, at some little distance from each other, one being in area N. (No. 1239) the second in area U (No. 1237), and the third in area V (No. 1238); and it did not flower along with all the other species in 1916. But apparently it has flowered on earlier occasions at the same time as other species, and probably the conditions which lead to the flowering of all are very similar. One tree of *S. leprosula* which had not flowered in 1916, a young tree, flowered in 1917: clearing had been done round it in 1916 and it had received some injury during the work. There was consequently in its case a change of conditions which might account for the flowering. In the case of all the species, such records as exist in the Singapore herbarium suggest that flowering occurs in the first suitable season after three years have elapsed from the last heavy seed-crop.\n\nIn India *S. robusta* flowers in almost every year, but on the average one year in three only is a year of good seed.\n\nR.

By the year 915 A.D. Arab traders had voyaged to Kedah, and it is related\\(^1\\) that they found there a large and important port for trade. It is highly improbable that they made many converts; but undoubtedly some of them married native wives and Muhammadanism must have made headway in the port itself.\n\nIn 1292 A.D. Marco Polo visited Sumatra. He relates how he found Muhammadans in the port of Perlak, but that the people of Samudra\\(^2\\) and Pasai were still heathen. In Marco Polo's day Kedah had fallen from its previous estate as a trading port and Pasai had taken its place. The *Hikayat Raja-Raja Pasai* (*J. R. A. S., S. B., No. 66, pp. 9-15*) gives a story of Merah Silu ruler of Pasai marrying a daughter of the ruler of Muhammadan Perlak and taking the title of Sultan Maliku's-Salleh on his conversion to Muhammadanism; and this story is corroborated in the seventh chapter of the *S\u00e9jarah Melayu*. Sultan Maliku's-Salleh died in 1297 A.D. At that time Pasai was the chief trading port in these seas.\n\nTo this day are preserved Muhammadan tomb-stones at Pasai, dated 1407 A.D. They have been identified by a Dutch archaeologist\\(^3\\) as coming from Cambay in India; and they bear the closest resemblance to tomb-stones at Grisek in Java and at Bruas, the site of an old Malay kingdom between Perak and the Dindings. Of course, the early missionaries were not only Arabs but Indians from Gujerat and Malabar or Kalinga as it was then called. And the *S\u00e9jarah Melayu* furnishes confirmatory evidence of the custom of bringing tomb-stones from India to Malayan countries (Chapter VII).\n\nThe *S\u00e9jarah Melayu* records (Chapters XX and XXXII) how there was constant intercourse between Pasai and Malacca. In his \"Commentaries,\" Affonso d' Albuquerque gives a native\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) \"Cathay and the way thither,\" Col. H. Yule, c.b. (London, Hakluyt Society, 1866).\n\n\\(^2\\) In 1346 Ibn Batuta found the king of Samudra an ardent Moslem.\n\n\\(^3\\) \"De grafsteenenen te Pas\u00e9 en Grissee vergeleken met dergelijke monumenten uit Hindoestan\" by J.

The Chinese records chronicle that the Malays of Malacca had become Muhammadans by the year 1409 A.D. Anyhow all tradition describes Sultan Muhammad Shah as the first Muhammadan prince of Malacca. That prince ascended the throne in 1403 A.D. and died in 1414 A.D. In that century Malacca succeeded Pasai, as Pasai formerly had succeeded Kedah, as the chief centre of sea-trade. The port of Malacca was filled with foreigners, Arabs, Indians, Javanese, missionaries, traders, mahouts and so on. And the path of the Muhammadan missionary was still hard. Witness some of the stories told against him in the *S\u0113jarah M\u0113layu*:\n\n\u201cA boat came from Jeddah to Malacca. In it was a man of great religious learning, by name Maulana Sadar Jahan. Sultan Mahmud Shah became his pupil and ordered his son Raja Ahmad also to take lessons. One night the Bendahara Sri Maharaja sat discussing religion with the missionary, when Sri Rama a confirmed drinker entered the worse for liquor. The Sultan bade his servants bring food for Sri Rama; and they brought it in a silver bowl, covered with an embroidered cloth. Sri Rama saw the Bendahara Sri Maharaja talking with the Arab teacher, and remarked, \u2018Come on, I\u2019ll have a lesson too.\u2019 The Bendahara invited him to be seated. Sadar Jahan saw that Sri Rama was drunk and noticed that his breath smelt of spirits: so he observed in Arabic, \u2018Drink is the mother of all beastliness.\u2019 Sri Rama retorted, \u2018Covetousness is the mother of all beastliness, and you came here in search of profit.\u2019 The missionary was exceedingly wroth and went home, refusing all efforts of the Bendahara to detain him.\u201d\n\nAnd again:\n\n\u201cTun Mai, whose nickname was The Hairy Caterpillar, took lessons from the Arab teacher. He was not apt at learning, because it is hard for a Malay to pronounce harsh Arabic sounds. So the teacher was upset and remarked, \u2018Your pronunciation is very bad: I make one sound and you another.\u2019 Quoth Tun Mai, \u2018Yes, I find it very hard to pronounce Arabic, as it is not my own language. If you talked Malay, you would be in a similar case.\u2019 The teacher replied, \u2018What difficulty is there in the pronunciation of Malay that I cannot master.\u2019 Quoth Tun Mai, \u2018Say kuching.\u2019 The Arab said \u2018Kusing.\u2019 Quoth Tun Mai, \u2018Wrong! Say kunyit.\u2019 The Arab said \u2018Kuzit.\u2019 \u2018Say nyiru.\u2019 The Arab said niru. Said Tun Mai the Hairy Caterpillar, \u2018A pretty notion you have of pronouncing Malay! Just like my notion of pronouncing Arabic.\u2019 Then Sadar Jahan was exceedingly angry and declared, \u2018Never again will I give lessons to Tun Mai the Hairy Caterpillar.\u2019\u201d\n\nAll sorts of merchandise came to Malay ports like Malacca from Arabia, India, Persia; and references to such novelties are frequent in Malay folk-tales, the *Ht. Awang Sulong*, the *Ht. S\u0113ri Rama* and so on:\u2014\nBaju-nya b\u0113l\u0113du ainu'l-banat..........\nKain-nya kain Bugis K\u0113mbayat..........\nK\u0113ris-nya s\u0113mpana ganja iras,\nK\u0113ratan tongkat nabi Adam,\nS\u0113rpa\u012b b\u0113si Kh\u0113rsani..........\nDi-pakai jubah khasah halus,\nJubah m\u0113leret sampai ka-kaki;\nS\u0113rban Kashmiri warna hijau,\nBuatan Arab di-n\u0113g\u0113ri M\u0113kkah..........\nK\u0113ris s\u0113mpana ganja iras\nPamur janji di-t\u0113ngah\nPamur jilallah di-tuntong,\nPamur alif t\u0113rdiri s\u0113ndiri-nya;\nBukan-nya b\u0113si sa-barang b\u0113si.\nB\u0113si l\u0113beh p\u0113nganching kaabah Allah.\n\nCambay, Khorassan, Kashmir, Mecca were all familiar names to these Malay buyers of foreign merchandise.\n\nSultan Mansur Shah, who died in 1475 A.D., conquered Pahang Kampar and Indragiri and introduced Muhammadanism into those countries. His tomb-stone beautifully carved, with an inscription in Arabic, lies now in two fragments outside the front door of the Residency at Malacca. Certainly it was no Malay craftsman who did the lettering.\n\nThis tomb-stone of Sultan Mansur Shah, if the date has been correctly deciphered as 880 A.H., is a few years later than that of the Muhammadan saint at Pangkalan K\u0113mpas. The Indian lettering on the Pangkalan K\u0113mpas stone has never been deciphered; but the Malay inscription in Arabic lettering, evidently done locally and by an amateur carver, records that it marks the grave of one Shaikh Ahmad Makhtar Ramali ibni Martu Talani and was erected in A.H. 872 (corresponding to 1467 A.D.) \u201cin the reign of Sultan Shah Mansur.\u201d It is possible that parts of the Shaikh\u2019s tomb were constructed locally and that other parts, like the ornate so-called \u201cSword,\u201d were brought from India, as we have seen was a common custom. The word \u201cAllah\u201d stands carved in high relief on the \u201cSword,\u201d so that one may surmise it is a genuine Muhammadan relic, and not a Hindu stone adapted for a Muhammadan shrine, as might be contended if \u201cAllah\u201d were cut into the surface of the stone; a word in high relief must almost certainly form part of the original ornamentation. It shows the interest that has been taken in our few archaeological remains, when as late as 1910 a keen enquirer like the late Mr. Barnes could write of the tomb-stone of Raja Fatimah of Pahang, which is dated A.H. 901 = A.D. 1496, as \u201cthe oldest dated grave-stone in the Peninsula\u201d! (J. R. A. S., S. B., No. 60, pp. 37-39). Like Sultan Mansur\u2019s tomb-stone Raja Fatimah\u2019s stone has an inscription in the Arabic language and the lettering too is not amateurish but less fine perhaps than that on the Sultan\u2019s.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 77, 1917.\nUnless the author of the *S\u0113jarah M\u0113layu* has been guilty of anachronism Malay translations of the Muhammadan stories of Hanafiah and Amir Hamza were classics by the year 1511 A.D. and Malacca\u2019s warriors read them on the eve of the Portuguese attack which was to break Malay power in Malacca. Anyhow they were classics by 1616 A.D., the date of the *S\u0113jarah M\u0113layu*.\n\nThe last Malay ruler of Malacca became the first ruler of Johor. By him and his descendants Muhammadanism was introduced into Johor, Riau and Lingga.\n\nBut after the fall of Malacca, Acheen became the centre of native trade and of the Muhammadan religion. In 1524 A.D. Sultan Ibrahim of Acheen conquered Pidi\u0113 and Pasir. From 1606 till 1636 A.D. Acheen was ruled by Sultan Iskandar Muda, called Mahkota Alam. By him were conquered Indrapura, Deli, Siak, Johor, Kedah and Perak. In his reign all sorts of books were written in Malay or translated from the Arabic into Malay at Acheen; for instance, the *S\u0113jarah M\u0113layu* and the *Bustanu\u2019s-salatin*. The *Bustanu\u2019s-salatin* was written by Shaikh Nur\u016b\u2019d-din of Gujerat. This Shaikh Nur\u016b\u2019d-din Muhammad Jilani ibni Ali ibni Hasanji ibni Muhammad Hamid a\u2019r-Ramiri also did into Malay the religious work, the *Siratu\u2019l-mustakim* in the year 1634 A.D. Our Kedah Annals, the *Hikayat Marong Mahawangsa*, relate (*J. R. A. S.*, *S. B.*, No. 72, p. 115), how the king of Acheen and Shaikh Nur\u016b\u2019d-din sent letters and copies of the *Babu\u2019l-nikah* and *Siratu\u2019l-mustakim* to the raja of Kedah on the occasion of his country\u2019s conversion to Islam:\u2014a story which, as Mr. Blagden has pointed out, helps to fix the date of the *Kedah Annals*. The Acheenese account gives 1474 A.D. as the date of Kedah\u2019s acceptance of Muhammadanism; and the *S\u0113jarah M\u0113layu* relates that a raja of Kedah went to Malacca to receive recognition as ruler from the king of Malacca, a Muhammadan prince: so that it is probable that Muhammadanism had been accepted at the Kedah court in the XVth century, though the conquest of Kedah by Acheen may have given it a fillip in the XVIth century. Possibly conquest by Acheen stimulated Muhammadan influence in Perak too. Anyhow in the XVIIth and XVIIIth centuries Sayids of the great Hadhrumast house of Ahmad bin Isa al-Mohajir\u00b9 (*Paper on Malay Subjects, Law Part II*, pp. 1-7, R. J. Wilkinson) gained enormous power at the Perak court.\n\nAs for the spread of Islam in Sumatra. From Acheen it spread to Ulakan; from Ulakan into Minangkabau:\u2014*Ulakan s\u0113rambi Acheh, Acheh s\u0113rambi M\u0113kkah*. In the XVIIth century the people along the coast of the Lampong district began to be converted, and in the XVIIIth the people up-country too.\n\nIn Java, early centres of Muhammadan influence were Grisek Surabaya and Madura.\n\n\u00b9 This family will form the subject of a later paper.\nThe first Arab missionary to Java was Maulana Malik Ibrahim, who came to Grisek and lived there till he died in 1419 A.D. S\u00e8dayu, Tuban, Japara, and Demak soon became Muhammadan. In 1478 A.D. the Muhammadan princes of Java overthrew the old great Hindu kingdom of Majapahit. The ruler of Demak seized the regalia and proclaimed himself Sultan, and he and his descendants drove Hinduism to take refuge in Blambangan and Bali. The fall of Majapahit released its dependencies Palembang, Jambi and Inderagiri, and in those countries too Muhammadanism gained ground.\n\nAt the time of the fall of Majapahit there was an Arab missionary Shaikh Nuru\u2019d-din Ibrahim bin Maulana Israil, or Sunan Jati as he styled himself, who lived at Jati near Cheribon. He and his family gained great power. Cheribon came to be governed by this Shaikh Nuru\u2019d-din; Jakarta, or the district of Batavia, by one of his sons and Bantam by Hasanu\u2019d-din another of his sons.\n\nIn the middle of the XVIIth century a missionary went from Palembang to Borneo and made converts first at Sukadana and at Madan.\n\nIn 1606 A.D. a Minangkabau trader converted the raja of Pallo in the Celebes; and soon the people of Boni and Lui also became Muhammadans.\n\nAt the end of the XVth century the princes of Ternate and Tidor in the Moluccas and the people of Amboyna became Muhammadan.\n\nStudy of the genealogies of the ruling families of Sumatra, Java, Borneo, and even Mindanao (Studies in Moro History, Law and Religion, N. M. Saleeby) will throw still more light on the spread of this one of the world\u2019s great religions among the heathen peoples of the Malay archipelago.\n\nAn account of the conversion of the Malayan races of the archipelago is given in vol. II of the Encyclopaedie van Nederlandsch-Indi\u00eb under the caption \u201cMohammedanisme,\u201d but chronological points have been further corrected by B. J. O. Schri\u00e9ke in Het Boek van Bonang, Utrecht, 1916. An account of the early Muhammadan missionaries to Aceh is to be found in the Bustanu\u2019s-salatin, in the fragment published by Niemann in his Bloemlezing uit Maleische geschriften: Snouck Hurgronje\u2019s The Achinese, Vol. II, pp. 10-20 contains an authoritative summary of their doctrines. Van der Tuuk\u2019s \u201cAccount of the Malay MSS. belonging to the Royal Asiatic Society\u201d gives a catalogue of the works composed by the author of the Bustanu\u2019s-salatin, and by the pantheists Hamzah of Barus and Shamsu\u2019d-din of Pasai (Essays relating to Indo-China, vol. II, pp. 49-52). D. A. Rinkes has written a brochure entitled Abdoerraof van Singkel, (Friesland) being a study of Muhammadan mysticism in Java and Sumatra and containing a useful bibliography.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 77, 1917.\nMemorandum, on the Aborigines in the Jasin District of Malacca, dated 1892.\n\nBy C. O. Blagden.\n\n[This memorandum is taken from an official file in the records at Malacca, where it attracted the attention of Mr. L. E. Pipe Wolferstan, the Resident. At his suggestion, and with the consent of the Colonial Government, and also after submission to the author, it is published here that such valuable information may not be altogether lost sight of.] Hon. Sec.\n\nThe non-Muhammadan aborigines in the Jasin district are commonly known to the Malays as Orang bukit, Orang utan or (very generally) Orang raya.* They belong according to their own account to three principal tribes, viz: the Mentera, Jakun and Besisi, although individuals of other tribes e.g. the Kenaboi are occasionally met with. The Mentera say that they themselves are the real Malacca aborigines and that the true habitat of the Jakun is Johor and of the Besisi Sungai Ujong and Selangor. The Mentera also consider themselves very superior to the Jakun; they claim the tribal name of Biduanda in common with the Muhammadan clan of that name, and the Malays freely admit the fact of their own descent from the Biduanda tribe of the Mentera and style the Mentera Bangsa tinggi as opposed to the Bangsa rendah or lower caste of Jakun. The latter are distinctly on a lower scale of civilisation: they plant less than the Mentera and depend more on the chase; it is said that they freely eat animals that have died a natural death, even if in an advanced stage of decomposition, and certainly their huts are smaller, ruder, and of a more temporary make-shift appearance than those of the Mentera, and their settlements are not so permanent.\n\nThe Besisi as their language shows, are a Sakai tribe akin to those of the centre of the Peninsula and look upon the Mentera and Jakun as strangers calling them Landas or Belandas and professing not to understand their language which is indeed altogether different.\n\nThe Mentera and Jakun at this date (1892) speak dialects which, whatever their original character, are so deeply impregnated with Malay that they are little better than Malay\n\n* This term is never by the Jasin Malays used with reference to themselves except in direct opposition to the word raja.\n\nJour. Straits Branch R. A. Soc., No. 77, 1917.\npatois, though their pronunciation is so peculiar that they are not understood by Malays. That of the Mentera approximates closest to the ordinary Malay of their Muhammadan neighbours, while the Jakun dialect seems to retain more of its original character. The two appear to be closely connected, and frequently agree together while differing from the Malay, but as often as not Mentera agrees with Malay and differs from Jakun, while in a few cases all three diverge. The Mentera although they rather despise the Jakun have intermarried a good deal with them and it is almost impossible at present to keep the two dialects entirely apart: if a Mentera is asked for the Mentera equivalent of a Jakun word he usually lapses into Malay. On the other hand a good many words differ in the two dialects, but as they are generally understood fairly well by persons of both tribes, each being usually fairly conversant with the dialect of the other as well as its own, it is very difficult to ascertain accurately the points in which these two dialects differ from each other.\n\nThe general physical type of these aborigines is Malayan, but there are a variety of points in which they usually differ more or less from the normal Malay type; and it is almost always possible to recognize an Orang utan by his features even if he be dressed in the Malay style. Some individuals approximate very closely to the common Malay type: others present an appearance as if there had been a strong admixture of low caste Kling or Negro blood, the complexion being darker and the features coarser than in the Malay. This is more particularly the case in the Jakun who is usually of a distinctly lower type than the Mentera.\n\nSpeaking generally in the average type of Malacca Orang utan the nose projects more than in the Malay and the prognathism is more pronounced. The upper lip is thicker and more projecting and the chin tends rather to recede, the lower lip hanging somewhat as compared with Malays.\n\nThe eye is somewhat different in expression from that of the Malay, but it is hard to describe the precise nature of the difference, though when once seen it is easily recognised.\n\nThe hair which is often worn long by the men is almost always wavy and sometimes quite curly; it is always black, except when grizzled by age, and in young children when it has a brownish tinge.\n\nThe face hair is scanty, as also is the hair on the body. The height varies a good deal but the average is probably somewhat less than among Malays. The legs and arms are often thin, but in some individuals they are well developed and muscular.\n\nThe aborigines, as has been mentioned already, differ somewhat amongst themselves in respect of their social habits. The Mentera usually live in fairly good houses surrounded by a small\nplantation of yams, sugar-cane, papayas, maize and sometimes either hill or swamp-padi according to the situation. Occasionally they plant coconuts. They hunt all manner of animals, principally monkeys and squirrels for food, and many of them have guns though they still use the sumpitan on occasions. Their houses are small but constructed something like those of Malays and roofed with wild atap.\n\nEach settlement is a sort of society by itself and the principal inhabitant usually bears the title of P\u011bnglima. Monogamy appears to be the usual practice, but in some cases a man has two wives. Marriages take place soon after the age of puberty in the case of girls and do not apparently involve any particular ceremony beyond cohabitation, although sometimes a feast is made. Funerals also involve no special ceremony. According to their own account no religious ceremonial at all is practised by the Orang utan and they profess no sort of acquaintance with any deity though they believe in the existence of malignant spirits and especially in the ghosts of the dead. It is out of fear of the latter that they make a practice of shifting their settlement after a funeral.\n\nMany of the Orang utan have become christianised by the French Mission, but it may be doubted whether their new religion is ever very clearly understood by them. It has however undoubtedly contributed to raise them in the social scale, and their standard of comfort is certainly higher than it used to be, according to the description given in the Hikayat Abdullah and other works, some decades ago. Even those who remain heathen or have relapsed into heathenism seem to have shared in the material improvement consequent on the attempt to convert them.\n\nThe number of aborigines in this district according to the Census of 1891 was only 77, but there is no doubt that this was an understatement and I should think that there are probably nearly double as many. A list of their settlements as far as is known to me is appended and it is to be observed that apart from those living in the jungle there are in this District some half dozen cases of Orang utan women living in the kampong with Chinese or Malays as wives or as concubines, viz: at Ayer Panas, K\u0113sang, Bukit S\u0113nggeh, Batang M\u0113laka, Nyalas and possibly elsewhere.\n\n**ABORIGINES IN THE JASIN DISTRICT.**\n\n| No. | Mukim                  | Tribe          | Remarks                      |\n|-----|------------------------|----------------|------------------------------|\n| 1   | Ayer Panas, Ulu Gapam  | M\u011bnt\u011bra & Jakun| 5 or 6 houses, Hun Guan\u2019s estate. |\n| 2   | \u201e                       | B\u011bmban (Ulu M\u011bnt\u011bra Samajok) | 2 or 3 houses.               |\n| 3   | \u201e                       | B\u011bmban M\u011bnt\u011bra | 3 houses.                    |\n| 4   | \u201e                       | Ayer Ch\u011brmin M\u011bnt\u011bra | 2 houses.                   |\n\nR.

Merrill.\n\nBureau of Science, Manila, P.I.\n\nTwo previous papers on the Bornean flora have recently been published by me*, and the present contribution is in the nature of a continuation of these. Like the preceding papers, it consists chiefly of the description of apparently undescribed species in various genera, and the recording to Borneo for the first time of a number of previously described species of other authors. In the present communication forty-eight new species and one new genus are proposed in the families Ulmaceae, Anacardiaceae, Elaeocarpaceae, Myrtaceae, Loganiaceae, Apocynaceae, Rubiaceae, and Compositae. The larger number of additions to the Bornean flora, so far as the present paper is concerned, are found in the Myrtaceae, especially in the genus Eugenia, and in the Elaeocarpaceae.\n\nULMACEAE.\n\nGironniera, Gaudichaud.\n\nGironniera paucinervia, sp. nov.\n\nArbor glabra partibus exceptis junioribus et stipulis et fructibus minute adpresse strigillosis; foliis oblongo-ovatis, in siccitate pallidis, usque ad 10 cm. longis, glabris vel subtus minutissime scaberulis, basi acutis, aequilateralibus vel subaequilateralibus, apice tenuiter subcaudato-acuminatis, margine integris vel sursum obscure crenulatis, nervis utrinque 5 vel 6 adscendentibus curvatis anastomosantibus; infructescentiis axillariibus, solitariis, 1 ad 2 cm. longis; fructibus paucis, plerumque 1 vel 2, ovoideis, compressis, circiter 8 mm. longis, acuminatis.\n\nA tree, the younger parts, stipules, and fruits minutely appressed strigillose, otherwise glabrous.

There are in our comparatively small collections of Bornean plants at least twenty-five distinct species of this characteristic genus, not all of which are in condition for determination, some specimens being with very young buds, others with fruits only. Species previously credited to Borneo are few in number and include the endemic species Elaeocarpus beccarii, Aug. DC., E. gambir, Becc., E. octantherus, Aug. DC., E. longipetiolatus, Merr., and E. sericeus, Stapf; as well as species previously described from extra-Bornean material, such as E. longifolius, Blume, E. obtusus, Blume (probably E. littoralis, T. & B.), E. stipulis, Blume, perhaps a misidentification of E. gambir, Becc., E. acronodia, Mast. (not Aronodia punctata, Blume) = E. mastersii, King, and E. griffithii, Mast. In view of the fact that further collections will unquestionably yield many additions to the list of Bornean species of Elaeocarpus, I have made no attempt to prepare a key to the species already known from the Island, but record below a number of species new to Borneo and describe nine as new. Five or six additional forms, none of which can be referred definitely to any described species, are represented in our collections, but before reporting them additional material will be necessary in each case.\n\nR.

Leaves subcoriaceous, oblong-elliptic, 13 to 17 cm. long, 5.5 to 7.5 cm. wide, of about the same color on both surfaces, brown and shining when dry, the midrib on very young leaves slightly pubescent, otherwise glabrous, the base acute, apex rather prominently acuminate, margins distinctly crenate, often denticulate-glandular; lateral nerves 7 or 8 on each side of the midrib, prominent, anastomosing, the reticulations lax; petioles 2.5 to 5 cm. long. Racemes numerous, spreading, from the axils of the fallen leaves, 15 to 17 cm. long, appressed-pubescent with somewhat brownish hairs. Flowers numerous, 5-merous, 10 to 12 mm. in diameter, their pedicels about 1 cm. long. Sepals brown when dry, lanceolate, acuminate, about 6 mm. long, 2 mm. wide, externally obscurely pubescent, margins puberulent, inside keeled and slightly pubescent at the base. Petals obovate-cuneate, about 6 mm. long and 5 mm. wide, narrowed to the cuneate base, the upper two-thirds cut into about 30, very slender laciniae, these in turn arranged in five dichotomous phalanges, margins of the lower part obscurely pubescent and the base outside with a few hairs, otherwise glabrous. Stamens about 35: filaments scabrid, 1.5 mm. long, curved, anthers oblong, scabrid, 2 mm. long, the cells obtuse, equal, not bearded at the tips.

A. Soc., No. 77, 1917.\nThe alliance of this species is manifestly with *Elaeocarpus glaber*, Blume, of Java, of which a complete description has apparently never been published. My conception of the species is based largely on the figure given by Koorders, (*Atlas Baumart. Java*, fig. 427), which was in part drawn from Blume\u2019s type material. The Bornean form differs in its larger, more numerously nerved, more prominently acuminate leaves, longer petioles, apparently slightly larger flowers, differently shaped petals, and but very slightly pubescent ovary.\n\n**Elaeocarpus dolichobotrys**, sp. nov. \u00a7 Dicera.\n\n*Arbor, novellis inflorescentiisque exceptis glabra; foliis oblongis ad oblongo-ovatis, subcoriaceis, olivaceis, nitidis, usque ad 27 cm. longis et 13 cm. latis, apice obtusis, basi rotundatis, margine perspicue crenatis, crenulis in sinubus apiculato-glandulosis, nervis utrinque circiter 16; racemis ex axillis defoliatis, solitariis, leviter pubescentibus, usque ad 40 cm. longis, multifloris; floribus circiter 1.5 cm. diametro, 5-meris; sepalis margine excepto glabris, 7 mm. longis; petalis obovato-cuneiformibus, circiter 8 mm. longis, infra obscure pubescentibus, multifimbriatis; staminibus circiter 40, antheris obtusis, valvis aequilongis; ovario pubescente, 3-loculare.*\n\nA tree, the growing tip of the branchlets and the inflorescence more or less pubescent, otherwise glabrous. Branches terete, grayish-brown, the branchlets smooth, reddish-brown, glabrous except the very tip. Leaves alternate, large, oblong to oblong-ovate, subcoriaceous, olivaceous and shining when dry, of the same color on both surfaces, up to 27 cm. long and 13 cm. wide, base broadly rounded, narrowed in the uppermost part to the obtuse apex, the margins prominently crenate, the sinuses apiculate-glandular; lateral nerves about 16 on each side of the midrib, prominent, anastomosing, the reticulations lax; petioles 5 to 8 cm. long. Racemes solitary, from the axils of fallen leaves, 30 to 40 cm. long, sparingly pubescent. Flowers numerous, cream-colored, 5-merous, about 1.5 cm. in diameter, perfect, their pedicels slightly pubescent 5 to 8 mm. long. Buds ovoid, slightly pubescent. Sepals in anthesis oblong-lanceolate, acuminate, 7 mm. long, 2.5 to 3 mm. wide, glabrous, prominently keeled within, their margins puberulent. Petals obovate-cuneate, about 6 mm. long, 6 to 7 mm. wide above, minutely and obscurely pubescent in the lower 2 mm. inside and on the margins in the lower 4 mm. otherwise glabrous, the upper two-thirds cut into about 49 very slender fimbriae, these arranged in about 9 phalanges. Stamens about 40; filaments curved, about 2 mm. long; anthers oblong, scabrid, 2.5 mm. long, the valves equal, obtuse, with no terminal tuft of hairs. Disk-glands prominent, densely pubescent, more or less reniform, about 2.5 mm. wide. Ovary ovoid, pubescent, 3-celled; style 2 mm. long, glabrous.\nThis species is well characterized by its large leaves and its greatly elongated racemes. It is undoubtedly allied to *Elaeocarpus robustus*, Roxb., from which it is distinguished by its larger, more numerously nerved leaves, much longer racemes, and larger flowers.\n\n**Elaeocarpus castaneus**, sp. nov. \u00a7 Ganitrus.\n\nArbor, ramulis junioribus et subtus foliis ad costam nervosaeque et petiolis et inflorescentiis uniformiter cinereo-pubescens; foliis in siccitate castaneis, nitidis, oblongis, subcoriaceis, usque ad 15 cm. longis, nitidis, perspicue obtuse acuminatis, basi subacutis ad subrotundatis, margine distanter obscure crenulatis vel subintegris, nervis utrinque 7 vel 8, prominentibus; racemis numerosis, ex ramulis defoliatis, usque ad 16 cm. longis, multifloris, 5-meris; sepalis lanceolatis, acuminatis, 5 mm. longis, utrinque pubescentibus; petalis obovato-cuneatis, leviter pubescentibus, in dimidio superiore laciniatis, laciniis circiter 25; staminibus 25 ad 30, antheris oblongis obtusis; ovario dense pubescente, 5-loculare.\n\nA tree, the branchlets, midrib and nerves on the lower surface of the leaves, petioles and inflorescences uniformly subappressed, cinereous-pubescent.

Racemes from the ultimate branches below the leaves, numerous, spreading, uniformly cinereous-pubescent, 14 to 16 cm. long, many-flowered. Flowers 5-merous, their pedicels pubescent, 6 to 7 mm. long. Sepals lanceolate, acuminate, 5 mm. long, 1.8 mm. wide, pubescent on both surfaces, slightly keeled inside, the margins densely cinereous-puberulent. Petals obovate-cuneate, about 6 mm. long, the upper one-half cut into about 25 slender laciniae, these arranged in about 6 phalanges, very sparingly pubescent on both surfaces toward the base and on the margins, base cuneate. Stamens 25 to 30; filaments about 1 mm. long; anthers oblong, obtuse, 1.2 to 1.5 mm. long, the longer cell tipped with 2 or 3 short hairs.

It somewhat resembles Elaeocarpus stipularis, Blume, but is distinguished by its fewer-nerved leaves which are glabrous except the midrib and nerves; there are no stipules on the specimens examined. From Elaeocarpus ganitrus, Roxb. it is distinguished by its fewer-nerved leaves, its anthers on distinct filaments, and other characters.\n\nElaeocarpus winkleri, sp. nov. \u00a7 Monocera.\n\nArbor, inflorescentis leviter pubescentibus exceptis glabra; foliis subcoriaceis, in siccitate pallidis, nitidis, oblongo-ovatis, usque ad 8 cm. longis, basi acutis vel subacutis, apice tenuiter acuminatis, margine obscurissime leviter glanduloso-denticulatis, nervis utrinque 7, subtus prominentibus, curvatis, anastomosantibus, reticulatis densis, subfoveolatis; racemis axillaribus, solitariis, usque ad 6 cm. longis, leviter adpressae cinereo-pubescentibus, partibus vetustioribus glabris; floribus 5-meris, 6 ad 7 mm. longis; sepalis in siccitate nigris, lanceolatis, acuminatis, utrinque leviter pubescentibus; petalis oblongis vel obscure oblongo-obovatis, extus parceissime pubescentibus, intus ad carinam prominente densissime villosis, basi late rotundatis, cucullatis, margine plus minusve inflexis, apice usque ad tertiam partem fimbriatis, fimbriae 10 ad 13; staminibus cirratis 25; ovario pubescente, 3-loculare.\n\nA tree, entirely glabrous except the sparingly cinereous-pubescent inflorescence and the buds at the tips of the branchlets.

Koorders, (Exkursionsflora von Java 2 (1912) 570), distinguishes Elaeocarpus littoralis, T. & B., from E. obtusus, Blume, stating that the former is not wild in Java, but is rarely cultivated in parks; the type of Elaeocarpus obtusus, Blume, was from Mount Salak, Java. Both Elaeocarpus littoralis, T. & B., and E. obtusus, Blume, judging from the\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 77, 1917.\ndescriptions of the latter species, are entirely distinct from the Philippine *E. monocera*, Cav.

The species is definitely reported from Penang, Malacca, Perak, and Singapore.

It differs from our material representing Wallich's species in its very densely tawny-tomentose branchlets petioles and midrib, on the lower surface of the leaves.

However, Koorders and Valezon* state that the Javan species is not the same as the one from the Malay Peninsula described by Masters, and the form figured by Koorders\u2020 is apparently distinct from that of the Malay Peninsula and Borneo. *Elaeocarpus gambir*, Becc., is very imperfectly described, but Dr. Beccari has kindly supplied me with material from the type, and also fragments of *Beccari*, 3191 and 2486, and a specimen collected by Riedel in Billiton, all of which apparently represent the same species.\n\n**Elaeocarpus beccarii**, Aug.

Up to the present time about forty species of the genus have been described from Bornean material, chiefly by Korthals, Blume, and Miquel, but some of the species proposed by Korthals are scarcely intelligible without an examination of his types, and some of his types are apparently no longer extant, judging by the fact that Miquel was unable to determine the status of several of the species. In our own collections of Bornean material about 60 distinct species are represented, but some of the specimens are not\nin condition for identification. With nearly 100 distinct species in the Malay Peninsula, over 70 in Java, and more than 175 in the Philippines, it is not at all surprising that so many should be found in Borneo. It is confidently expected that when the flora of Borneo shall have been more thoroughly studied, the list of Bornean species of *Eugenia* will be found well to exceed 100 distinct forms. In the present paper I have described as new those forms that appear to me to represent species previously undescribed, and have credited a number of species already described by other authors from extra-Bornean material to the Island.\n\nIn the present study of this Bornean material, as in my past studies of Philippine representatives of the genus, I have placed all under *Eugenia*, *sensu latoire*, as it is absolutely impossible to distinguish definitely between *Eugenia*, *Jambosa*, and *Syzygium*, as genera, on account of the very large number of intermediate forms. Occasionally species are found, for which no subgenus or section has ever been proposed, that differ more markedly from *Eugenia* \u00a7 *Eu-eugenia* than do *Jambosa* and *Syzygium*, yet it seems to be illogical to propose new generic names for such forms; a good example of these is *Eugenia paradoxa*, Merr., described below. Blume attempted to distribute the Malayan species of *Eugenia* into a number of genera, such as *Syzygium*, *Jambosa*, *Strongylocalyx*, *Gelpkea*, *Cleistocalyx*, *Clarimyrtus*, *Microjambosa*, etc., but his proposition has not met with the approval of other botanists. In *Eugenia* as in other polymorphous groups, such as *Loranthus*, there seems to be no middle ground. The botanist must either accept the genus in its broadest sense or, as van Tieghem has proposed for *Loranthus*, divide it into a very large number of genera that can be distinguished from one another only by a critical study of each individual species. *Eugenia* as such, is a strongly marked group, and is always easily recognizable, and it seems best to treat all the species under this name. Niedenzu's division of the group into *Eugenia*, *Jambosa*, and *Syzygium* is certainly untenable. In the present paper I have placed those species with free petals in the section *Jambosa*, no matter if the petals are calyptrate, so long as they are not united and those species that have united calyptrate petals in the section *Syzygium*.\n\n**Eugenia coralina**, sp. nov. \u00a7 *Jambosa*.\n\n*Arbor glabra, ramis ramulisque teretibus; foliis oppositis, coriaceis, ellipticis, usque ad 12 cm. longis, in siccitate pallidis vel pallide viridibus, nitidis, perspicue obtuseque acuminatis, basi acutis vel decurrente-acuminatis, supra impresso-punctatis, subtus glandulosis; nervis primariis utrinque circiter 20, tenuibus, patulis, rectis, haud prominentibus, quam secundariis vix magis distinctioribus; inflorescentiis terminalibus, corymbosis, circiter 5 cm. longis, e basi ramosis, ramis plerisque trichotomis cum axin ramulosoque rugosis more coralii brunneis; floribus 5-meris, obovoideis, 2,5 mm. longis, breviter*\n\nR.

Soc., No. 77, 1917.\nThis species, like the next, is anomalous in *Tristania* by having but a single stamen opposite each petal, and this character alone might be deemed sufficiently important to warrant describing the present species as a new generic type. However, as the fruits are unknown, and as in all other characters the plant corresponds with *Tristania*, I have so described it. In some species of *Tristania* the reduction of the number of stamens is very marked; I have a specimen of *T. sumatrana*, Miquel, from Billiton in which there are but two or three stamens opposite each petal, while in the Philippine *T. decorata* there are but three stamens opposite each petal, so that it is not surprising to find a plant that is a *Tristania* in all respects, except its stamens, in which the reduction in the number of stamens has gone to the extreme of one stamen for each petal.\n\n**Tristania pentandra**, sp. nov.\n\nFrutex 2 ad 3 m. altus novellis inflorescentiisque exceptis glabre; foliis alternis, oblongis ad oblanceolatis, coriaceis, in siccitate brunneis, nitidis, usque ad 9 cm. longis, utrinque subaequaliter angustatis acuminatisque, haud puncticulatis, nervis utrinque circiter 18, adscendentibus, tenuibus, obscuris; inflorescentiis axillaribus, pubescentibus, pedunculatis, circiter 2.5 cm. longis; floribus 5-meris, 2 mm. longis, staminibus 5; ovario 3-loculare.\n\nA shrub 2 to 3 m. high, the younger branchlets and inflorescences brown-pubescent, the very young leaves sparingly pubescent, otherwise glabrous. Branches terete, dark-brown, the branchlets nearly black when dry, irregularly angled or subterete. Leaves crowded, alternate, oblong to oblanceolate, brown and somewhat shining when dry, not glandular-puncticulate, 6 to 9 cm. long, 1.5 to 2.5 cm. wide, subequally narrowed and acuminate at both ends, the apex blunt-acuminate; midrib impressed on the upper surface, prominent beneath, the lateral nerves slender, obscure, ascending, about 18 on each side of the midrib, anastomosing with the slender submarginal veins about 1 mm. from the edge of the leaf.

Known to the Dyaks as bindang.\nThis species strongly resembles the Philippine *Tristania decorticata*, Merr., and has been so reported by Robinson.* However, it is at once distinguishable from the Philippine species by its solitary stamens opposite each petal, a character unknown in the genus *Tristania* except in the present species and in *T. anomala*, Merr. It is readily distinguished from the latter by its much larger, differently shaped leaves.\n\n**Tristania clementis**, sp. nov.\n\nArbor parva, glabra ramulis junioribus exceptis inflorescentisque minute adpresseque cupreo-pubescentibus; foliis subcoriaceis, oblongo-obovatis, nitidis, usque ad 7.5 cm. longis, obtusis ad late obtuseque acuminatis, basi cuneatis, margine leviter recurvatis, subtus distincte puncticulatis, nervis primariis utrinque circiter 15 tenuibus; inflorescentiis axillaribus, pedunculatis, circiter 3 cm. longis, dichotomis; floribus 5-meris, circiter 3 mm. diametro, petalis glabris, orbiculari-obovatis, minute crenulatis; staminibus 25 vel 30 in phalangibus 5-vel 6-andris dispositis; ovario pubescente, 3-loculare.\n\nA small tree, glabrous except the minutely appressed-cupreous-pubescent branchlets and inflorescences.

Distinguishing characters are its laxly veined leaves, its four stamens, and its petals being united into a distinct calyptra as in *Syzygium*. It apparently holds about the same relationship to *Syzygium* as *Aphanomyrtus* does to *Jambosa*.\n\n**LOGANIACEAE.**\n\n*Fagraea*, Thunberg.\n\nThis genus is apparently well developed in Borneo, for a number of species have been described already from the comparatively small Bornean collections available to botanists in the past sixty-five years. The following species have been described from Bornean material: *Fagraea borneensis*, Scheff., *F. coarctata*, Blume (= *F. racemosa*, Jack, fide King), *F. cordifolia*, Blume, *F. crassipes*, Benth (= *F. cuspidata*, Blume, fide Boerlage), *F. cuspidata*, Blume, *F. heterophylla*, Blume, *F. ligustrina*, Blume, *F. macroscypha*, Baker, *F. minor*, Blume, *F. robusta*, Blume (= *F. racemosa*, Jack, fide King), *F. spicata*, Baker, and *F. splendens*, Blume (= *F. rostrata*, Blume, fide Miquel); also there is *F. stenophylla*, Becc., named, but as yet undescribed. In addition to these a few other species have been credited to Borneo by various authors, including *Fagraea racemosa*, Jack, (*F. morindaefolia*, Blume), and *F. litoralis*, Blume, var. *forstenii*, Miq. From a study of our own Bornean collections, however, it is evident that many forms of this characteristic genus still remain to be described, for these comparatively small collections present no less than fourteen distinct species of the genus. A number of these I have been able to determine as species previously described by other authors, but five are apparently worthy of description as new species.\n\n**Fagraea grandifolia**, sp. nov.\n\nSpecies *F. racemosae* affinis, differt foliis majoribus, nervis magis numerosis, utrinque 10 ad 12; foliis ellipticis ad oblongo-ellipticis, coriaceis, pallide brunneis, usque ad 35 cm. longis, apice abrupte brevissime et obtuse acuminatis, basi subrotundatis; inflorescentiis 20 ad 30 cm. longis, longe pedunculatis, cymis oppositis, distantibus, paucifloris, inferioribus pedunculatis, superioribus sessilibus; floribus circiter 2.5 cm. longis, longe pedicellatis.\n\nR.

Inflorescences terminal, including the peduncles 20 to 30 cm. long, the peduncles about as long as the flower-bearing parts, the flowers in distant opposite cymes, the lower cymes peduncled and about 5 cm. long, the upper sessile, all few-flowered. Flowers 5-merous, about 2.5 cm. long, their pedicels 5 to 13 mm. long. Calyx cup-shaped, about 6 mm. long, the lobes broad, rounded. Corolla-tube about 2.2 cm. long, gradually widened upward, the lobes elliptic, rounded, spreading, about 7 mm. long.\n\nSarawak, Baram District, Miri River, Hose 742, April 20, 1895.\n\nThe alliance of this species is manifestly with Fagraea racemosa, Jack, from which it is readily distinguished by its larger more numerously nerved leaves, long peduncled, lax inflorescences, the opposite cymes rather widely separated, the lower ones peduncled and the upper ones sessile, few-flowered, the flowers rather long-pedicelled.\n\nFagraea acuminatissima, sp. nov.\n\nSpecies F. obovatae affinis, ramis ramulisque brunneis, teretibus; foliis coriaceis, oblongo-ellipticis, usque ad 20 cm. longis, eveniis, basi acutis, apice tenuiter acute caudato-acuminatis, opacis, in siccitate brunneis vel supra subolivaceis; petiolo 2.5 ad 5 cm. longo; inflorescentiis terminalibus, sessilibus vel brevissime pedunculatis, umbellatim 3- ad 5-floris; floribus sessilibus, circiter 5 cm. longis; calycis lobis ovatis, obtusis, circiter 6 mm. longis; corollae tubo circiter 3 cm. longo, sursum ampliato, lobis patulis, oblongis, obtusis, circiter 1.5 cm. longis.\n\nApparently scandent, entirely glabrous, the branches and branchlets terete, dark-brown, the ultimate ones 4 to 5 mm. in diameter, smooth.

Calyx 10 to 11 mm. long, the lobes ovate, obtuse, 6 mm. long. Corolla-tube about 3 cm. long, slender below, gradually widened in the upper one-half and about 7 mm. in diameter at the throat; lobes spreading, oblong, obtuse, about 1.5 cm. long; anthers somewhat exserted, about 2 mm. long.\n\nSarawak, Matang road, Native collector 686 (Bur.

In this specimen the leaves are relatively wider, about 14 cm. long and 7 cm. wide, while the flower is slightly longer than in the type, the corolla being 5.5 cm. in length.\n\nThe alliance of this species is manifestly with Fagraea obovata, Wall., from which it is distinguished by its differently shaped, slenderly and acutely caudate-acuminate leaves. By the latter character it is also distinguished from the Bornean species, Fagraea heterophylla, Blume, F. rostrata, Blume, and F. splendens, Blume.\n\nFagraea involucrata, sp. nov.\n\nGlabra, ramis ramulisque teretibus; foliis oblongis ad oblongo-ellipticis, crasse coriaceis, usque ad 22 cm. longis, in siccitate supra atro-brunneis, subtus brunneis, opacis, apice abrupte et tenuiter acute acuminatis, basi acutis vel decurrento-acuminatis, nervis utrinque circiter 10, supra obscuris, subtus prominentibus; stipulis subreniformibus, coriaceis, reflexis, circiter 1.5 cm. latis; floribus terminalibus, solitariis, sessilibus, circiter 20 cm. longis, bracteolis 4 elliptico-ovatis acutis vel acuminatis crasse coriaceis circiter 4 cm. longis calycem involucrantibus; calycis tubo vix 1 cm. longo, lobis oblongo-ovatis, acuminatis, coriaceis, 6 cm. longis; corolla alba, tubo 15 cm. longo, sursum ampliato, lobis patulis vel reflexis, ovatis, 3.5 ad 4 cm. longis; antheris exsertis, 1 cm. longis.\n\nGlabrous, the branches and branchlets terete, dark-colored when dry, the ultimate ones 6 to 8 mm. in diameter, smooth.

Flowers terminal, sessile, solitary, white, the calyx subtended and enclosed by an involucre of four, thickly coriaceous, brown (when dry), acute to acuminate bracteoles about 4 cm. long and 2 to 2.5 cm. wide which closely invest the calyx. Calyx 7 cm. long, the tube broad, scarcely 1 cm. in length, the lobes brown when dry, thickly coriaceous, oblong-ovate, acuminate, 6 cm. long, 2.5 to 3 cm. wide, imbricate.

February-June, 1914.\n\nThis remarkable species is manifestly allied to Fagraea macroscypha, Baker, and in fact I first referred it to Baker's species. It differs in its distinctly acuminate, not acute, larger leaves, larger calyx, and corolla, and perhaps in other characters. Baker's description is imperfect in some respects, and he does not indicate the number of bracteoles in his species.\n\nFagraea cymosa, sp. nov.\n\nArbor parva, glabra, ramis ramulisque teretibus, glauco-pruinosis, vel ramulis junioribus brunneis et leviter compressis; foliis late ovatis, vel elliptico-ovatis, crasse coriaceis, usque ad 23 cm. longis, in siccitate brunneis, apice abrupte acuminatis, basi late truncato-rotundatis, nervis utrinque 6 ad 8, prominentibus; inflorescentia terminalibus, cymosis, diffusis, usque ad 11 cm. longis, breviter pedunculatis, dichotomis; floribus 2 vel 3 in ramulis ultimis dispositis, longe pedicellatis, circiter 5.5 cm. longis.

These two specimens differ from the type in having somewhat smaller flowers, the corolla about 3.5 cm. in length, but in other characters closely approximate it.\n\nThe alliance of this species is manifestly with Fagraea racemosa, Jack, from which it is distinguished by its much shorter, cymose, rather diffuse inflorescences and long-pedicelled flowers. It differs from the other Bornean species in this group, namely Fagraea coarctata, Blume, F. crassipes, Benth., F. cuspidata, Blume, and F. robusta, Blume, in its shortly peduncled inflorescences which are cymose, not racemosae in arrangement.\n\nFagraea uniflora, sp. nov.\n\nFrutex scandens, ramis ramulisque teretibus; foliis oblongis, coriaceis, in siccitate atro-brumneis, usque ad 14 cm. longis, basi acutis, apice tenuiter acute acuminatis, nervis utrinque circiter 7, tenuibus, valde obscuris vel subobsoletis; floribus solitariis, terminalibus, pallide luteis, breviter pedicellatis, bibracteolatis, circiter 13 cm. longis; calyce 3 cm. longo, lobis 6 ovato-ellipticis, circiter 1 cm. longis, coriaceis; corollae tubo 8 ad 9 cm. longo, lobis 8 vel 9 oblongis vel leviter oblongo-obovatis, obtusis, coriaceis, circiter 4 cm. longis.\n\nA scandent shrub, apparently epiphytic, glabrous.

Boerlage also places Fagraea robusta, Blume, here, and, with doubt, F. appendiculata, Blume. King, however, has referred the first to F. racemosa, Jack.

In our own collections of Bornean plants no less than thirteen distinct species are represented, some of the specimens manifestly pertaining to forms described by Valeton, others representing characteristic and strongly marked species that I cannot refer to any known forms of the genus. In 1909 but about six species of the genus were known from the Philippines, but the Philippine list today approximates twenty distinct forms, and current collections indicate that the list will be considerably increased as botanical exploration of the Archipelago progresses. It is not surprising, then, that a number of undescribed forms should be found in our comparatively small collections of Bornean plants, and it is confidently expected that a continued botanical exploration of Borneo will yield many other species of this characteristic genus.\n\nTimonius hosei, sp. nov.\n\nArbor, ramulis et inflorescentiis et foliis pubescentibus; foliis oppositis, oblanceolatis ad oblongo oblanceolatis, petiolatis, usque ad 20 cm. longis, chartaceis ad subcoriaceis, apice breviter acute acuminatis, basi gradatim angustatis, cuneatis, in siccitate pallidis, utrinque praesertim ad costam nervosoque breviter pubescentibus; nervis utrinque 14 ad 16, prominentibus, venis subparallelis; stipulis ovato-lanceolatis, circiter 1.8 cm. longis, acuminatis, extus pubescentibus, intus dense pallide adpresse-hirsutis; inflorescentiis axillaribus, confertis, brevisime pedunculatis, plerumque trichotomis; floribus 5-meris circiter 1.5 mm. longis.\n\nA tree, the branches terete, pale, glabrous, the branchlets rather densely ferruginous-pubescent with short hairs.

O. Winstedt.\n\nIn his account of rice-ceremonies in *J. R. A. S.* No. 29, p. 8, 1896, Mr. C. O. Blagden, writes:\u2014\"at planting there are also ceremonies. Sometimes there is a special service known as *bapua*, consisting of a sort of mock combat, in which the evil spirits are believed to be expelled from the rice-fields by the villagers: this is not done every year, but once in three or four years.\" He remarks that *bapua* is the Minangkabau pronunciation of *berpuar* and that *puar* is a plant, whose stem is used in the mock-combat. Mr. Skeat quotes this on p. 250 of *Malay Magic*; in Selangor, he adds, this mock-combat is called *singketa*.\n\nTwo years ago, I saw this combat take place at Johol. Two parties assembled one on each side of a gully and hurled the *puar* rods across at one another, till a blow in the face gave one of the combatants a bloody mouth and spoilt the fun. It lasted about half an hour. The rods or darts were about $3\\frac{1}{2}$ feet long, thin green and straight, and the pared root gave them a flat end like that of a stethoscope: it was this flat end which was thrown foremost. It has been suggested to me that they are stems of a ginger-plant. A *pawang* opened the proceedings with an invocation. The purpose was to expel all evil influences from the fields before planting. I was informed that *singketa* is a more serious combat with heavier weapons\u2014*batang pisang*, if I remember rightly.\nLexicographical coincidences in Khasi and Malay.\n\nBy R. O. Winstedt.\n\nSir George Grierson reviewing Pater Schmidt's 'Die Mon-Khmer-V\u00f6lker Zentralasiens und Austronesiens' in Vol. I, 1907, of the J. R. A. S., pp. 187-191, observes how Schmidt has shown that there exists in Further India an important group of languages, embracing Mon, Khmer, Palaung, Wa and a number of minor forms of speech, including S\u0113mang and Sakai, which was neither Thibeto-Burman nor Sinitic, while on the other hand it was closely related with the Khasi spoken in Central Assam. We have \"presented to our view, a group of cognate languages reaching from the Punjab, through Central India, Assam, the Nicobars and Further India to the Malay Peninsula.\" This group, which Schmidt termed the Austroasiatic family falls into several sub-groups:\n\nI. (a) Semang.\n   (b) S\u0113noi, Sakai and Tembe.\n\nII. (a) Khasi.\n    (b) Nicobar.\n    (c) Wa, Palaung, Reang.\n\nIII. (a) Mon-Khmer.\n     (b) Munda.\n     (c) Cham, etc.\n\nSchmidt surmises \"that the first two are in a stage of development earlier than that of the last, a fact which is important for determining the relative times of the migration of each group to its present seat.\" In 1899 Schmidt connected this Austroasiatic group with the Austronesian group in a paper which may be read conveniently in the Bulletin de l'\u00c9cole Francaise d'Extr\u00eame-Orient, tome VII, 3 and 4, under the title 'Les Peuples Mon-Khmer, trait d'union entre les peuples de l'Asie centrale et de l'Austron\u00e9sie.' Since that paper appeared, the connection has been accepted. There is affinity between Khasi and Malay; and my present paper is an attempt by one acquainted with Malay to give further evidence. For Khasi I have used the Khasi-English Dictionary by U. Nissor Singh, (Shillong, 1906).\n\nThis paper is not strictly scientific. Now that the R. A. S. has printed Mr. Blagden's translation of Brandstetter's philological\n\nJour. Straits Branch R. A. Soc., No. 77, 1917.\nessays, there is no excuse for students of the Malayan languages to be ignorant of the methods of scientific philology. Each language of a group should first be compared with its own immediate cognates, e.g. Khasi with Nicobarese, Wa, Palaung, etc., before it is compared with distant relatives. From such a comparison we can discover the limits of phonetic variation of the individual sounds and can often deduce from the modern forms a more archaic form for each group. We ought, for example, to get at the original or primitive Austroasiatic and Austronesian forms respectively and then compare; not compare modern Malay with modern Khasi. It is not enough to assume that a Malay $t$ can be represented by a $t$ in Khasi: it should be shown that an Austronesian $t$ is in a whole series of cases represented by a $t$ in the Austroasiatic group and that that $t$ is retained unchanged in the two modern languages. Only then can we assume that the Malay $t$ or $b$ or $n$ corresponds with the Khasi $t$ or $b$ or $n$ and so that Malay words and Khasi words containing similar roots are really related.\n\nI have neither time nor opportunity for this scientific thoroughness. But I venture to print the list given below for one cogent reason. Scholars in Europe with a book knowledge of Malay are apt to miss nuances of meaning familiar to those accustomed for years to hearing the language spoken; and so to overlook real affinities. For most of the coincidences given in my list are very close and remarkable, and one has only to glance at them to see that many are coincidences the most rigorous philological method could not reject; coincidences not only of root but of duosyllabic and trisyllabic words.\n\nOne is tempted to connect the Khasi \u2018Rynkhiang\u2019 dry, parched with the Malay \u2018Rengkiang\u2019 granary, \u2018Shynkup\u2019 first room in Khasi house, enclosed porch with \u2018Sengkuap\u2019 a lean-to, kitchen adjunct; \u2018Mangkalai\u2019 long legged of fowls with \u2018Mengkalai\u2019 unfinished, having long trailing ends; of mat-work. Malays have a Hantu Sungkai, Khasis a Syngkai Bamon (= Brahmin). May \u2018Anak Dara Sunti\u2019 virgo intacta and \u2018Sunting\u2019 to pluck a flower actually or figuratively find their explanation in \u2018Syntiw\u2019 a flower? Possibly Khasi throws light on some unexplained place-names in the Peninsula: Sungai Teriang is a common name for a river: \u2018Teriang\u2019 in Khasi means eel. \u2018Naneng\u2019 in Khasi means from above.\n\n| Malay       | English                  | Khasi     | English                  |\n|-------------|--------------------------|-----------|--------------------------|\n| Bengkok     | bent                     | Pynkhoh   | to curve, bend, wrestle. |\n| Cf.

Wilkinson\u2019s Life and Customs, Part III, Malay Amusements (Kuala Lumpur 1910). Some years ago I got a copy of the rules of Malay chess as played at Sri Menanti in Negri Sembilan; and I kept it by me, in case I should ever learn the game and so be qualified to discuss them. Perhaps I never shall learn, or perhaps the white ants may have devoured my MS. before I find time and inclination to learn. So, now I print the rules as they stand, in case they may interest players of chess.\n\n(1) Tiap-tiap buah yang telah di-usek, buah itu-lah juga akan di-jalankan.\n\n(2) Boleh di-makan buah apa-apa suka, jika bergaul sa-kali pun.\n\n(3) Tiap-tiap bidak yang telah naik ka-merchu papan-nya boleh menjadi ganti tempat itu-lah; jika sampai ka-tempat mant\u00e9ri, boleh jadi mant\u00e9ri; demikian juga di-tempat lain-nya.\n\n(4) Bidak boleh b\u0113rjalan dua tapak pada pertama b\u0113rjalan, kemudian sa-tapak sahaja.\n\n(5) Raja tiada sa-kali-kali boleh berg\u0113rak, jika sa-b\u0113lum k\u0113na sah.\n\n(6) Jika tinggal satu bidak d\u0113ngan sa-orang raja, maka bidak itu Maharaja Lela, boleh di-jadikan mant\u00e9ri atau lain-nya.\n\n(7) Jika di-sah raja d\u0113ngan tiada bergaul, boleh juga raja itu m\u0113makn m\u0113mukul buah yang sah itu, baik sa-tapak atau dua tapak sap\u0113rti jalan kuda atau jalan t\u012bh (? = tir R.

Burkill.\n\nIn the Botanic Gardens, Singapore, there is a large plant of *Derris thyrsiflora*, Benth., climbing over a tree of *Cyrtophyllum fragrans*, DC., near to the Director's house. Its stem has a circumference at the base of eighty centimetres; and it ascends to nearly 20 metres. When in flower it is very conspicuous, and attracts enormous numbers of bees, whose hum on the flowers is heard all day. Among the bees are *Apis dorsata*, L., *Apis indica*, F., *Xylocopa latipes*, F. rarely, *X. aestuans*, L., *Anthophora zonata*, L., and *Melipona* sp. Occasionally a butterfly visits also.\n\nOwing to the height at which the flowers stand, it has been extremely difficult to take the insects; and the list is consequently imperfect.\n\nThe flower of *Derris thyrsiflora* in face and in side view \u00d7 2: the standard and right ala showing the places most injured by the bees.\n\nThe flowers are white with an undefined line of green down the centre of the standard. Their form is seen in the figures above.\n\nIn all their parts oxidation develops a black pigment: and by means of this it has been interesting to observe the injury which visitors do to the flowers; for injury results in oxidation.\n\nThe mechanism of the flower is typically papilionaceous. There is abundant honey within the staminal tube: the approach to it is by a wide opening upon either side of the free upper filament allowing easy access to those insects which can force apart the standard and the interlocked wings and keel sufficiently. The one\n\nJour. Straits Branch R. A. Soc., No. 77, 1917.\neffect of the forcing of these apart is injury to the claws of the petals which serve as springs, so that after visits they are suffused with the black pigment in consequence of rupture of the epidermal layer. The other effect is due to the feet and head of the visitors which they use in their effort to prise the flower open. Invariably as a consequence of this two dark spots develop at the base of the standard one on either side near the brow over the way to the honey. It is to be noted that this injury is invariable. And often these two areas can be seen to be made up of three or four confluent injuries, each resulting in a complete perforation of the limb. Corresponding with them may be seen perforations of the wings, which are less commonly confluent from being more dispersed. But of the wings still there is invariably damage about f., and also especially at the corner j. These places are close to the folds whereby the wings and keel are interlocked, but beyond them. Presumably they are at the points where the visitors get the best purchase.\n\nIn other parts of the standard and the wings there is but inconstant and slight damage done: and the keel which has the function of protecting the pollen rarely is marked except in its claws and sometimes at the very tip.\n\nIn about 5% of the falling flowers injury to the standard had occurred near b., and in less than 5% at c. In a greater percentage some injury occurred right at the tip. The wings are rarely damaged at k.\n\nThe evidence is very clear that every flower gets repeatedly visited. But only a small percentage set seed as over 90% fall entire. The remainder however are sufficient to supply what may be regarded as quite an abundant seed-crop.\nPlethiandra Sahebii, a new Melastomacea from Sarawak, described.\n\nBy I. H. Burkill.\n\nFlower of Plethiandra Sahebii seen from the front \u00d7 3.\n\nThe genus Plethiandra was created by Sir Joseph Hooker in 1867 for a plant collected by Motley on \"Gunong Say,\" (?) Sarawak. He placed it in the Astronieae following after the genus Kibessia. Baillon, *Natural History of Plants*, VII, 1881, p. 63, Krasser in Engler's *Pflanzenfamilien*, III, Abt. 7, 1893, p. 196, and Cogniaux in De Candolle's *Monographiae Phanerogamarum*, VII, 1891, p. 1111, were unable to add anything to what Sir Joseph had done: so that the genus remained\u2014as he had left it\u2014of one little-known species, described, so Stapf testifies, upon \"a rather poor specimen.\" Cogniaux, however, defined a genus Medinillopsis, i.e. p. 67, with two species,\u2014*M. Beccariana* from Sarawak, and *M. sessiliflora* from Singapore, both collected by Beccari: and this genus Stapf in Hooker's *Icones Plantarum*, plate 2418 (1896), reduced to Plethiandra.\n\nStapf had added to the genus two years earlier, a new species, *P. Hookeri*, from the mountain of Kinabalu (*Trans. Linn. Soc. London*, Botany. IV. 1894, p. 163), before he reduced Medinillopsis, and at the time of reducing it he described also *P. rejangensis*, *P. sessilis*, and *P. cuneata*, all from Haviland's Bornean collections, so raising the number of species to seven, six from Borneo and one from Singapore. Further be suggested that Cogniaux's Medinilla robusta is also a Plethiandra.\n\nIn adding to these another new species, I take the opportunity of figuring in outline from life its flower; for good as is the drawing of *P. Hookeri* in the *Icones* it was made from dried specimens, which do not permit the positions assumed by the stamens and stigma to be determined: and the flower is given as less markedly bisymmetric than it is likely to be.\n\nJour. Straits Branch R. A. Soc., No. 77, 1917.\nAs seen in *P. Sahebii*, the new species, the stamens take up a position above the stigma in horizontal flowers.\n\n*Flower of Plethiandra Sahebii*, from the side and in median section \u00d7 3.\n\n*Plethiandra Sahebii* is known from a single individual brought to the Singapore Botanic Gardens from Sarawak by a former employee\u2014Mr. B. K. Saheb. It has been grown with the object of determination. It has no horticultural value.\n\n*Foliage of Plethiandra Sahebii*, reduced to 1/3\n\n*Plethiandra Sahebii*, as known, is a shrub about a metre high, branching dichotomously from the ground upwards, so that from four stems it ends in 16 branches bearing leaves. Between these branchings there may be as many as six internodes, or only one. In the axils of the old leaves it begins to flower, and from the axillary bud continues to flower after the leaf has fallen, apparently without limit of time, so that it is cauliflorous. As the leaves are paired this results in two cushions of tissue opposite to each other which continue producing flowers in fairly rapid succession; but of these only one, or rarely two, is open at one time. Laterally at the node from just above the level of the insertion of the leaves there arise early, say, about the time when flowers are appearing, adventitious rootlets, and others follow just below the level of the insertion of the leaves. If these rootlets find anchorage they become well developed, and ultimately the effect is produced of the plant flower-\ning among its own roots; for the abbreviated axillary branch continues still to produce its flowers. Dichotomy is of course produced by the arrest of the terminal bud and the growth of the pair of axillary buds into leafing branches; where they are produced flowering still occurs for a second axillary bud arises below the first which becomes a cushion of flowers. The stems are glabrous; they are never exactly green, but when quite young are suffused with a dull claret colour becoming a livid brown, whereafter a greyish brown cork layer is developed, with lenticels rather abundantly scattered in it, and cracking longitudinally. The leaves are sessile, large, attaining 30 cm. in length by 12 cm. in breadth, ovate, rounded at the base, and where they touch, as they usually do, the tissues are apt to die on account of the water or damp earth caught and held by them, and into which the adventitious roots may find a way. When young the leaf-blades rise from the stem at an angle of about 60\u00b0 but the angle at the base increases with age: above the middle the blade arches over: and the leaf-tip usually is pointed somewhat earthwards. The midrib is thick and prominent on the lower side of the leaf, but grooved above: at right angles from it arise 3 or 4 pairs of strong lateral nerves, as figured above, increasing in strength and in distance from each other upwards: the uppermost of these usually is at one-third of the length of the leaf from the axil: the lower of these pairs fade away under the margin but the top and strongest reaches the apex, and rejoins the midrib. The reticulum is indistinct, and mainly transverse to the long axis of the blade. The margins of the leaves are slightly undulate, and also slightly decurved. Both sides of the blade shine, the upper being darker than the lower. When old the axillary cushions from which the flowers are produced may be 1 cm. in diameter, and raised 4 mm. in the centre, which is studded with old pedicel-stumps. There may be as many as 10 buds present at one time in various stages of development, but one or rarely two open flowers only. The ovary with the calyx, indistinguishable without section, is of a reddish magenta, smooth and about 3 mm. long, the margin quite even. The petals are 6, contorted in the bud, expanded almost at right angles to the axis of the horizontal flower in anthesis, obovate-elliptic, up to 6 mm. long. The stamens are all directed to the upper side of the flower, and are usually 28 in number: the filament is 3 mm. long and the anther 2 mm. long: the filaments are attenuated just under the anther but not appendaged: the anthers are just spurred at the base, and dehisce by an apical pore. The style is 9 mm. long, decurved in its basal half so as to pass to the lower side of the flower, and then uprising towards the stigma. The receptacle is very concave, which accounts for part of the greater length of the style over the stamens. The loculi are 6, and the ovules are very numerous.\n\nPlethiandra Sahebii, foliis P.

K. Saheb in Hortum Botanicum Singapurensem attulit ubi adhuc colitur.\n\nThe species of Plethiandra appear always to be glabrous: and probably all of them live in the shade in moss on tree trunks or sometimes on rocks, where moisture is constant. P. Beccariana possesses the largest leaves of the genus; for they attain 30 cm. in length by 16 in width. P. Sahebii goes with it in this respect. P. rejangensis has leaves up to 15 cm. by 7 cm. In other species they appear rarely to exceed 10 cm. No dimensions for P. Motleyi are available.\n\nP. Beccariana also has the largest flowers, thus:\n\n|       | calyx | petals | stamens |\n|-------|-------|--------|---------|\n| P. Beccariana | 6 mm. | 10 mm. | 10-12 mm. |\n| P. Sahebii     | 3 mm. | 6 mm.  | 5 mm.   |\n| P. Hookeri     | 5 mm. | 6 mm.  | 6 mm.   |\n| P. rejangensis | 5 mm. | 5 mm.  | (anthers say 4 mm.) |\n| P. cuneata     | 5 mm. | 7 mm.  | 3 mm.   |\n| P. sessiliflora | 4-5 mm. | 6 mm. | 5 mm. |\n| P. sessilis    | 4 mm. | 3 mm.  | (anthers 2 mm.) |\n\nThe flowers of P. Beccariana are long-pedicelled, the pedicels attaining 2 cm. It seems thus to be the most outstanding species of the genus.\n\nThe petals in Plethiandra are always 6, and it is probably usual for the ovary to have 6 loculi notwithstanding Sir Joseph Hooker's statement that P. Motleyi has 4 and Cogniaux's that his Medinillopsis has 3. In some species the calyx-teeth are just evident.\n\nThe apical pore of the anthers appears to be constant. The minute spurs at the base of the anther cells are so small that they might be overlooked easily: but there is no evidence that they are general.\n\nThe number of the stamens is variable. To the flower of P. sessiliflora Stapf ascribes 20; to P. Beccariana and P. sessilis Cogniaux ascribes 20-25; Hooker ascribes up to 30 to P. Motleyi: Stapf states that P. rejangensis has 25-30, P. Hookeri, 26-30, and...\nP. cuneata about 30. For P. Sahebii 28 is an almost constant number.\n\nStapf transfers Plethiandra to the neighbourhood of Medinilla, most of the species of which grow in moss on trees in just such damp forests as it inhabits, the number of stamens being equal to or twice that of the petals, i.e. 4, 5, 8 or 10. The Philippine genus Carionia, always placed close to Medinilla, is obviously also closely allied to Plethiandra but the stamens do not exceed 12, or twice the number of the petals, which are in it 6; and the flowers of Carionia are much larger than those of Plethiandra.\nINDEX.\n\nA\n\nAccounts, xvii\nAdinandra, 144\nAfzelia borneensis, 84\nAglaia borneensis, described, 87\n\" rufa, 17\n\" rufibarbis, 17\n\" tripetala, described, 80\nAgrostis infirma, 78\nAllophyllus scandens, described, 26\nAlyxia odorata, 238\n\" pachyphylla, described, 237\nAmoora malaccensis, described, 16\nAmpelocissus pedicellata, described, 94\n\" tenuis, described, 94\nAndropogon serratus, 75\nAneilema seaberrimm, 80\nAnisoptera costata, seedling of, 161\nAntheesisha, 138\nAntidesma cauliflorum, described, 89\n\" clementis, described, 90\n\" inflatum, described, 91\nArthrophyllum alternifolium, 37\n\" lancifolium, described, 38\n\" pinnatum, 37\nArtocarpus odoratissima, 80\n\" tarap, 80\nAylapia (Gordonia), 143\n\nB\n\nBarringtonia conoidea, 204\n\" curranii, 204\n\" dolichobotrys, described, 204\n\" dolichophylla, described, 205\nBauhinia holosericea, described, 28\n\" monticola, described, 28\nBees on Derris flowers, 263\nBegonia eiromischa, described, 36\n\" longicaulis, described, 35\n\" Kunstleriana, 37\n\" megapteroidea, 36\n\" paupercula, 35\n\" phoeniogramma, 35\n\" rhoephila, described, 36\n\" Roxburghii, 35\n\" Scortechini, 37\n\" tricornis, 35\nBerchemia reticulata, 23\n\nBesisi in Malacca, 177\nBindang (Tristania), 288\nBlagden, C.
