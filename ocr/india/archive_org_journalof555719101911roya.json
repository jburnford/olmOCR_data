Civil Service.\n\nProfessional story-telling has not yet been quite killed in the East, by the gradual diffusion of printed and lithographed books and newspapers. The old legends and romances are still, especially in places remote from European influences, handed down from father to son, and eagerly listened to by old and young at village festivals or domestic celebrations. To the Malays, the skilful raconteur, who can hold his audience enthralled with the adventures of his hero and heroine, or with elaborate descriptions of the magnificence of the palaces and courts of mythical Rajas, is the p\u0113nglipur lara, \"the soother of cares,\" by the magic of whose art all woes are temporarily banished.\n\nSitting in the balai of a Raja or Chief, or in the verandah of a private house, when the sun has gone down and the evening meal is over, the story-teller, very likely a man who can neither read nor write, will commence one of the romances of his repertoire, intoning the words in a monotonous chant as if he were reading aloud from a book. He has very likely been placed purposely near a doorway leading to the women's apartment, and the laughter and applause of the male audience without is echoed from behind the curtains, where the women of the household sit eagerly listening to the story. The recitation is perhaps prolonged far into the night, and then postponed, to be continued on the succeeding night. There is no hesitation or failure of memory on the part of the bard; he has been at it from his youth up, and has inherited his romances from his father and ancestors, who told them in days gone by.\nto the forefathers of his present audience. A small reward, a hearty welcome, and a good meal await the Malay rhapsodist wherever he goes, and he wanders among Malay villages as Homer did among the Greek cities.\n\nBeing in Perak as Assistant Resident some years ago, I was a witness on one occasion of the talents of one Mir Hassan, a native of Kampar in the south-east of that State, and brought him down to Larut with the intention of having his stock of legendary lore committed to writing. Official occupations interrupted this work, and it is only in this year (1886) that I have been able to have it completed, Mir Hassan having, through the influence of my friend Raja Idris* of Perak, been induced to visit me in Singapore. I now offer to the Society the Malay text of a romance called S\u0113ri Rama. Like the well known Malay hikayat of that name, it is founded upon the adventures of some of the heroes of the R\u0101m\u0101yana, but an oral legend current among the people has, of course, many points of interest, which are wanting in a written version, compiled by a scribe who may have knowingly borrowed from foreign sources. It may not, perhaps, be easy to trace much of the action of the great Hindu Epic in the somewhat childish narrative of the Malay village-singer, but of the profound influence which the R\u0101m\u0101yana and Mahabh\u0101rata have had in the Farther East\u2014the India extra Gangem and the islands beyond\u2014there can be no doubt. There is not a village-stage in Siam, Malaya or Java, the dramas of which are not directly referable to these sources, while the wrongs of Sita Dewi, the might of the saint Rawana, and the prowess of the monkey-king Hanuman are household words everywhere.\n\nMir Hassan\u2019s story was taken down verbatim from his lips by native writers, and I have gone carefully over it, getting from him explanations of obscure passages. Here and there the style is diversified by metrical passages in a peculiar rhythm not unlike specimens of Dayak blank-verse. The following sketch to the story, where passages of particular interest occur,\n\n*Now H. H. Sultan Idris, G.C.M.G.\nwill give those who are unable to read the original an insight into the style of a genuine Malay legendary romance.\n\nThe story opens in the kingdom of Tanjong Bunga, the Raja of which is called S\u0113ri Rama, married to the Princess Sa-kuntum Bunga Sa-tangkai (a single blossom on a stalk). S\u0113ri Rama\u2019s peace of mind is disturbed by the fact that, though he has been married for three years, he has no child, and for three months and ten days he ponders over this want of an heir. An idea occurs to him one night, and on rising in the morning he goes into the outer hall of his palace and ringing the alarm-bell brings all his people together. A metrical passage in which a tropical daybreak is described is not without some beauty of expression. The following is a somewhat free translation:\n\nLong had past the hour of midnight,\nLingered yet the coming day-light;\nTwice ere now had wakening infants\nRisen and sunk again in slumber;\nWrapped in sleep were all the elders,\nFar away were pheasants calling,\nIn the woods the shrill cicada,\nChirped and dew came dropping earthwards.\nNow lowed oxen in the meadows,\nMoaned the buffaloes imprisoned,\nCocks, with voice and wings, responded.\nAnd with feebler note the murai.\nSoon the first pale streak of morning,\nRose and upwards soared the night birds;\nPigeons cooed beneath the roof-tree,\nFitful came the quail\u2019s low murmur;\nOn the hearth lay last night\u2019s embers,\nFoot-long brands burned down to inches,\nHeralds all of day\u2019s approaching.\n\nThe palace is described with the usual oriental exaggeration. The length of the outer audience chamber is \u201cas far as the flight of bird, as far as the eye can see, as far as a horse can gallop at a stretch.\u201d Part of the art of the story-teller consists in piling up similes and synonymous descriptive phrases in this\nway. The signal which the Raja gives for the assembling of the people is another instance; \"he sounded the great forbidden drum, struck the gong of assembly, the chanang of summons.\"\n\nEveryone answered the summons\u2014the T\u00e9m\u00ebnggong, the Laksamana, the Orang Kaya B\u00ebsar, the F\u00ebrdana Mantri, the warriors, the army, and the people, great and small, old and young, male and female, high and low\u2014\n\n\"Those with young children came with their babies on their backs, the lame came leaning on their sticks, the blind came led by the hand, the deaf came enquiring on all sides, and the diseased came keeping their distance from the others.\"\n\nThe Orang Kaya T\u00e9m\u00ebnggong, one of the chief ministers of the State, then addressed the Raja asking what danger or accident had caused this summons:\n\n\"What fort has fallen down, what moat is choked up, what palisade has given way, what building is leaning over, what pillar is broken, what roof leaky, what wall ruinous, what flooring out of repair? Or has an army arrived from anywhere?\"\n\nThen S\u00ebri Rama related his disquietude at the want of an heir, and described how he had suddenly conceived the idea of sending for his elder brother Raja Laksamana, who lived far inland, in order that his advice might be asked. The T\u00e9m\u00ebnggong was at once despatched to call the latter.\n\nRaja Laksamana proceeded to the court with the T\u00e9m\u00ebnggong, and S\u00ebri Rama then explained that he had sent for his elder brother in the hope that he might be the depositor of some of the secrets handed down from ancient times, by means of which he might divine what was to happen in the future, and if an heir was yet to be born to him. This is an allusion to the art of divination still practised by Malay sorcerers and devil-dancers, the impiety of whose performances, from a Muhammadan point of view, is excused by immemorial usage. The proceedings of Raja Laksamana, described further on, are exactly those of a Malay pawang at the present day.\n\nThe great hall of the palace was at once got ready in accordance with Raja Laksamana's directions, and the imple-\nments and properties required by him were prepared. These were a candle (a cubit in length, measured from the elbow to the top of the middle-finger, as thick as a man's fore-arm and with a wick of the thickness of a man's thumb), some parched rice, yellow rice, sacred water, and eight cubits of white-cloth. Mats and carpets were spread, curtains and canopies suspended, and a sort of altar was erected in the centre of the hall.\n\nRaja Laksamana commenced operations by burning incense and fumigating with it the charmed water, with which he sprinkled the platform. He set the candle upright and lighted it, after having scattered some rice about. The candle was sprinkled with water, and there was more scattering of rice and waving of incense. Then, pulling the white cloth over his head and enveloping his whole body in it, Raja Laksamana remained in abstracted contemplation from sunset to daybreak the next morning. He then announced that an heir would be born to S\u00ebri Rama, but that he must first get up an expedition by water for the amusement of his Princess, fitting out for the purpose seven sea-going boats and collecting numbers of young people with bands of music to attend her. They were to proceed to a hill on the sea-coast, on the top of which would be found a lake of green water, with a river flowing down from it to the sea, and two lofty trees beside the lake. Strict warning was given to S\u00ebri Rama not to bathe in this lake, as whoever did so would instantly be turned into a monkey.\n\nThe Chiefs were then summoned to receive the Raja's orders:\n\n\"While yet some way off they bowed to the dust\nWhen they got near they made obeisance\nUplifting at each step their fingers ten\nThe hands closed together like the rootlets of the bakong palm\nThe fingers one on the other like a pile of sirih leaves.\"\n\nThe T\u00ebm\u00ebnggong having been directed to have seven boats built in seven days' time, returned home and forthwith summoned forty-four carpenters and gave them the necessary\ndirections. Working day and night without a break except for meals, the forty-four boat-builders completed their task at the close of the seventh day, and the boats fully equipped were launched and taken down to the Raja's private landing-place. Seven more days were occupied in assembling all the youths and maidens of the country to accompany the Princess. There was a forced levy of all these, through the P\u0113nghulus or headmen, by command of the T\u0113m\u0113nggong, and the Raja himself made his selection, from among the crowd brought together at the balai, of \"boys just approaching manhood and girls just ripe for marriage.\" Dresses of honour were given to these, musical instruments \"of the twelve kinds\" were got together, provisions for the expedition were put on board the new vessels, and all the Chiefs, warriors and attendants who were to accompany the Raja were assembled.\n\nAt this point, there occurs a long and curious description of the dress which S\u0113ri Rama wore; first his trousers\u2014\n\n\"He wore the trousers called ber\u0101duwanggi, miraculously made without letting in pieces; hundreds of mirrors encircled his waist, thousands adorned his legs, they were sprinkled all about his body, and larger ones followed the seams.\"\n\nThen his waist-band \"Flowered cloth, twenty-five cubits in length, or thirty if the fringe be included; thrice a day did it change its colour, in the morning transparent as dew, at mid-day of the colour of purple and in the evening of the hue of oil.\"\n\nNext, the coat \"A coat of reddish purple velvet, thrice brilliant the lustre of its surface, seven times powerful the strength of the dye; the dyer after making it sailed the world for three years, but the dye still clung to the palms of his hands.\"\n\nHis keris was a marvellous weapon\u2014\"A straight blade of one piece which spontaneously screwed itself into the haft. The grooves called r\u0113tak mayat started from the base of the blade, the damask called punur janji appeared half way up, and the damask called lam jilallah at the point; the damask alif was there parallel with the edge, and where the dama\u0161k-\ning ended the steel was white. No ordinary metal was the steel, it was what was over after making the bolt of God's Ka-\nbah. It had been forged by the son of God's prophet, Adam,\nsmelted in the palm of his hand, fashioned with the end of his\nfinger, and coloured with the juice of flowers in a Chinese fur-\nnace. Its deadly qualities came down to it from the sky and\nif cleaned with acid at the source of a river, the fish at the\nembouchure came floating up dead.\"\n\nThe sword that he wore was called \"the successful swoop-\ner,\" lit.; the kite carrying off its prey.\n\nThe next article described is his turban, which, among the\nMalays, is a square handkerchief folded and knotted round the\nhead:\u2014\n\n\"He next took his royal head-kerchief, knotting it so that\nit stood up with the ends projecting, one of them was called\nd\u00ebndam ta' sudah (endless love), it was purposely unfinished,\nif it were finished the end of the world would come. It had\nbeen woven in no ordinary way, but had been the work of his\nmother from her youth. Wearing it he was provided with all\nthe love-compelling secrets.\"\n\nTo the Malays, the hero of the story is, of course, a Malay,\nand he naturally wears the national garment\u2014the sarong:\u2014\n\n\"A robe of muslin of the finest kind; no ordinary weav-\ning had produced it, it had been woven in a jar in the middle\nof the ocean by people with gills, relieved by others with beaks;\nno sooner was it finished than the maker was put to death, so\nthat no one might be able to make one like it. It was not of\nthe fashion of the clothing of the rajas of the present day, but\nof those of olden time. If it were put in the sun it got damp-\ner, if it were soaked in water it became drier. A slight tear,\nmended by darning, only increased its value, instead of lessening\nit, for the thread for the purpose cost one hundred dollars. A\nsingle dew-drop dropping on it would tangle the thread for a\ncubit's length, while the breath of the south wind would disen-\ntangle it.\"\n\nBy the time that S\u00ebri Rama was dressed, it was mid-day,\n\"when the shadows are round,\" and it was time to embark.\nBut he had first to comply with the (Malay) observance, included under the term of *langkah*, which assure to a traveller a successful journey and a safe return:\u2014*\u201cHe adopted the art called \u2018sidang budiman,\u2019 the young snake writhed at his feet (i.e., he started at mid-day when his own shadow was round his feet), a young eagle was flying against the wind overhead; he took a step forward and then two backward, one forward as a sign that he was leaving his country, and two backward as a sign that he would return; as he took a step with the right foot, loud clanked his accoutrements on his left, as he put forth the left foot a similar clank was heard on his right, he advanced swelling out his broad chest, and letting drop his slender fingers, adopting the gait called, \u201cplanting beans\u201d and then the step called \u201csowing spinach.\u201d\u201d\n\nAs soon as the Raja had embarked, anchor was weighed and the expedition started amid the beating of drums and gongs and the blowing of trumpets. Cannon and muskets were fired (for anachronisms do not shock the taste of a Malay audience), the popping of the latter being compared to roasting paddy when the grain flies out of the husk with a slight report. The swiftness of the boats is most graphically described:\u2014\n\n\u201cIt was like a palm-shoot hurled as a spear, like an eel darting away when caught by the tail, like a cockchafer escaping when its string is broken. The fly which settled (on one of the boats) found it slip from under him, the bird on the wing was overtaken and caught, the wind blowing in the same direction was passed by, an article thrown ahead from the bow fell into the water astern.\u201d\n\nAfter seven days and seven nights spent in amusement at sea, the Princess proposed to her husband to land and see the place described by Raja Laksamana, where the river flowed down to the sea from a green lake on the mountain. Orders were given accordingly, and next morning the immense assem-\n\n*A long step and a slow swing of the arms reminds a Malay of the way a man steps and raises his arm to plant bean-seeds six feet apart; a quicker step and a rounder swing of the arms is compared to the action of scattering small seeds.*\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nblage landed \"when the sun was already high, filling the plain with its heat, about the period called tulih tenggala.*\" Leaving the older men to look after the boats, the royal couple, attended by their Chiefs and subjects, climbed the hill, a path being cut for them through the forest. About the period of mid-day prayer, they reached the top, and found a lake exactly as described by Raja Laksamana. The Princess was at once seized with a violent longing to bathe in its waters and, without saying a word to her husband, she plunged in; she was immediately turned into a monkey and sprang chattering up one of the two large tualang trees which grew on the banks. On seeing this, S\u00ebri Rama followed her example, jumped into the lake, and a moment afterwards joined his consort in the trees in the form of a monkey. Their subjects broke out into lamentations and remained below the trees watching with astonishment the antics of the King and Queen, who were jumping about among the branches. It was quite in vain that the T\u00ebm\u00ebnggong implored the King to come down, he was quite unconscious of the entreaties addressed to him. Then the Chiefs took counsel together and it was resolved that the T\u00ebm\u00ebnggong should return to Tanjong Bunga and fetch Raja Laksamana, the King's elder brother, while the rest remained to watch. On the eighth day the T\u00ebm\u00ebnggong reached his destination, and presenting himself before Raja Laksamana explained what had happened. The latter, after providing himself with all the implements of sorcery (mat, carpet, p\u00ebt\u00ebrana, candle, parched rice and yellow rice), set off for the scene of the catastrophe, leaving the T\u00ebm\u00ebnggong in charge of the palace. The incantations were immediately successful, and S\u00ebri Rama and his Princess came down from the trees, plunged into the lake, and emerging from the water resumed their human form. Orders were then given for the immediate return of the whole party.\n\nNot long after this the King learned that his hopes of having an heir were likely to be fulfilled, and he summoned all his\n\n*Tulih tenggala, the time when the ploughman looks round at the sun, feeling the morning rays striking on his back.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 55, 1909.\npeople and, informing them that the Princess was pregnant gave orders that there should be general rejoicings. Religious men (L\u010dbais, Hajis, Imams and Khatibs) were to be assembled, and there were to be readings of the Koran and unlimited feasting. This was duly carried out, and the rejoicings went on until the time for the child\u2019s birth approached. The main building was duly prepared for the event and a crowd of Chiefs and attendants assembled, but to the horror of everyone, when the King\u2019s heir was born it turned out to be an infant monkey, \u201cnot thicker than a man\u2019s forearm.\u201d There was some discussion as to how the news was to be conveyed to S\u011bri Rama and who was to ask him, according to custom, to name the newborn infant, but at length the eldest of the nurses undertook the commission, and presented herself before the King. Her speech is a characteristic specimen of the way in which a Malay sets to work to break an unwelcome piece of news to a Raja. \u201cPardon, my Lord, a thousand pardons, I prostrate myself in the dust before your Highness\u2019 feet. I, your old servant, would make known that there is a matter which it is difficult either to impart or to withhold, I am fearful of mentioning it to your Highness, but if it shall not be imputed to me as a fault, I will do so; if I am to incur your Highness\u2019 wrath by informing you, I ask permission to retire, but if you approve, I will speak.\u201d\n\nOf course the King commanded her to speak; on hearing the news he said nothing, but left the naming of his first-born to the old woman, who accordingly called him K\u0113ra K\u0113chil Imam T\u0113rgangga. In seven days the monkey was able to go alone to the great hall to play, and when he was forty-four days old he was strong enough to roam about the country from hamlet to hamlet amusing himself. He used to absent himself all day, and returned home in the evening. His father sat at home alone, overcome with grief and shame at the thought of the nature of his offspring. For three months and ten days he sat pondering in this way, and then again he summoned his Chiefs and people to hear a plan which he had resolved on. He had decided to rid himself of the animal which was a stand-\ning source of shame to the kingdom, and to banish him to a remote part of the forest where human foot had never yet trod. The T\u00e9m\u00ebnggong and Laksamana received orders to carry out this decree. The Princess wept and declared that, though banished, he was and should be, her son for all time. \"She looked up and the tears gathered in her eyes, so that when she bowed her head they dropped in a shower, like the fruit of the b\u00ebmban falling from ripeness, like grains of maize pouring on the drying floor, like the beads of a necklace when the string has snapped, like drizzling rain at morn. Such were the tears of the Princess weeping for her son.\" The T\u00e9m\u00ebnggong and Laksamana, after a search, found the monkey up in a duku tree and told him of the King's orders. He rather liked the idea of getting away into the open forest, and set off with the T\u00e9m\u00ebnggong willingly. After the usual \"seven days\" journey, they reached a spot where man had never trodden before, \"where no horse-fly or gad-fly, even, had ever been.\" There they camped for a night, and on the following morning the T\u00e9m\u00ebnggong took his leave and returned, bearing dutiful messages to S\u00ebri Rama and the Princess from the little monkey now left alone in the forest.\n\nK\u00ebra Kechil Imam T\u00ebrgangga, abandoned to his own devices, soon got tired of the little hut which the T\u00e9m\u00ebnggong and his men had built for him, and he resolved to travel. Swinging himself from branch to branch, he made his way through the forest; fruit and flowers and tender shoots supplied him with food, and for three months and ten days he pursued his journey, travelling by day and resting at night. At last he reached the sea and skirted the coast until he came to a walled and fortified town, which was evidently the capital of some great Raja. He made his way to the palace, but no one was to be seen, and walking into the hall of audience, he seated himself on the throne \"with one leg tucked under him and the other hanging down.\" Soon he became aware that a party of female attendants were watching him and he performed all kinds of antics. They rushed off and told the head-nurse and she proceeded to awaken the Raja, who was no less a\nperson than Shah Numan himself* \"by pulling the great toe of each foot alternately.\" Directing the attendants to follow him with his cushion and betel-box and gold and silver vessels, Shah Numan entered the great hall and at once accosted the monkey, who came down from the throne and advanced bowing politely. The questions put by the Raja were quite unnecessary, for he knew all about his visitor already, and was able to tell him his name and that of his father and mother and declared himself to be related to S\u0113ri Rama and his wife. He invited the monkey to stay with him, and told the female attendants to supply his \"grandchild,\" as he called him, with plenty of tender shoots and leaves to eat. But when he found that his guest ate up forty-four baskets full of shoots in one night, he told him plainly that he could not possibly entertain an animal whose appetite was so disproportioned to his size and he directed him to betake himself to Mount Inggil-b\u0113ringgil, where there were said to be all kinds of fruit. He warned him, however, against attempting to eat one large round red fruit which he described.\n\nNext day the monkey set off for the mountain, but disregarding all the fruit, which was there in plenty, he made straight for the top and thence he saw the large round red fruit mentioned by Hanuman. He tried to grasp it, when the thing spoke to him and declared itself to be no fruit, but the sun itself, placed there by God to illumine the earth. In spite of warnings to keep off, the monkey made an audacious attempt to seize the sun and fell senseless to the earth.\n\nThe scene then changes to a country called Tahwil, where there reigned a King called Shah Kobad, who had a daughter known as the Princess Renek Jintan. The latter was one day amusing herself with music and singing and dancing at a place outside her father's city where her people had pitched a\n\n*This is of course a corruption of the name of Hanuman, the monkey-king of the R\u0101m\u0101yana, but the Perak narrator has blundered over the first syllable and has supplied the word \"Shah\" as one having a specific meaning. The adventures of Hanuman are, in this story, assigned to K\u0113ra K\u0113chil.\ntent for her, when suddenly the little monkey fell down in the middle of the assembled multitude. The Princess took charge of him, for he still had life though unconscious, and she sent to the palace and procured cloth and had clothes made for him. Seeing a ring on his little finger, she transferred it to her own which it exactly fitted. She was so enchanted with her new plaything that she would not go home, and the King and Queen and the whole Court had to come down and see what was going on.\n\nShah Numan, when his \"grandchild\" had been absent for three days and nights, began to get uneasy about him, and he went to Mount Inggil-b\u00ebringgil in search of him. Being unsuccessful, he went to the top and waited for the sun to rise. \"Peace be on you,\" said he to the sun. \"And on you be peace,\" responded the sun with the politeness of a Muhamma-dan. A conversation ensued. The sun pretended at first not to know where the little monkey had gone, but being reminded that from his position he could see all that went on in the world, he explained everything and said that the absentee would be found in the country of Tahwil, where the King's daughter was at that moment playing with him. Shah Numan asked the sun to get him back, and the sun put out a long hot hand and picked him out of the Princess' lap. There was intense heat on the earth, and then a moment of darkness, during which it was found that the monkey had disappeared. The Princess went weeping home.\n\nShah Numan took the delinquent, still unconscious, to his palace and, brought him back to life. He then ordered him to quit the kingdom where he had given so much trouble. The monkey refused to go, pleading that he was afraid to live alone in the forest. Upon this Shah Numan explained that he need be under no fear, for he would instantly be acknowledged as their king by countless multitudes of subjects, who were divided into four tribes, each governed by four Chiefs.\n\nNext day, acting on the King's directions, K\u00ebra K\u00ebchil Imam T\u00ebrgangga betook himself to the forest, and made his way to the plain of Auta-b\u00ebranta to the north of Mount Inggil-\nb\u0113ringgil. Taking his stand under an enormous b\u0113ringin tree in the centre of the plain, and placing his arms akimbo, he successively faced the four points of the compass, and called upon the Chiefs of the tribes by name to come and attend him. Then with a rushing sound like that of a hurricane or the crashing of a thunderbolt came the monkey-chiefs with their troops. These were Janggit, Mabit, Baya Panglima Baya, B\u0113gar Hulubalang, Nila Kam\u0101la, Dardi, Malah, Jambuana, Sang Kamala Sina, Raja Marjan Singa, and Marjan Singa B\u0113ranta-lawi. Very ferocious did they look, with gaping mouths as red as the fires of Jahanam, and as cruel as a tiger which has just seized its prey.\n\nThe monkey hordes speedily acknowledged the new-comer as their sovereign, and he took up his abode in the plain of Anta-b\u0113ranta at their head.\n\nThe story then shifts to a certain Maharaja Duwana (Ravana), who inhabited the island of Kachapuri* in the middle of the ocean. He had fallen in love with the Princess Sa-kuntumBunga Sa-tangkai merely from hearing the description of her beauty, how her waist could be encircled by the fourth fingers and thumbs joined, how her figure was as slim as a stem of millet, her fingers as slender as the stalk of the lemon-grass, and her heels as small as birds\u2019 eggs; how when she ate sirih or drank water her face acquired an indescribable charm. The supernatural power which Maharaja Duwana possessed enabled him to fly through the air from his own country to Tanjong Bunga, where he alighted outside S\u0113ri Rama\u2019s palace. There the magic charms which he employed strangely affected the Princess, though she was in her own apartments, and neither she nor her attendants could understand her uneasiness.\n\nSubsequently, when she was amusing herself in the morn-\n\n---\n\n*The ancient name of Conjeveram in the Madras Presidency, 46 miles S. W. of Madras. It is called Kachchi in Tamil literature, and Kachchipuram is probably represented by the modern name.\u2014Yule\u2019s Glossary, p. 782. The incidents which, in the Ramayana, take place at Lanka are, in this story, transferred to Kachapuri.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\ning in the principal *balai* with all her attendants, Maharaja Duwana appeared in the form of a golden goat,* and excited the curiosity of every one, even of S\u0113ri Rama himself, who summoned all his people to seize this extraordinary prodigy. They chased it in vain, for it always eluded seizure; just when any number of hands were put out to grasp it (the narrator compares the outstretched fingers of the multitude to the legs of a millipede!) it always disappeared. In vain S\u0113ri Rama had fences, walls and houses levelled in order to give it no cover, the golden goat still escaped its pursuers. In the afternoon it went outside the fort to feed, and there again it was fruitlessly hunted until evening; when S\u0113ri Rama declared that he would not go home until it was caught, and night found him and his people holding each other's hands and groping about in the dark in the jungle after the mysterious animal.\n\nThe King having thus been safely disposed of, Maharaja Duwana got back into the fort and resumed his own shape. Then he made his way to the door of the Princess' chamber, which he found locked with twelve locks. Striking the door with his magic turban, which had all the love-compelling attributes which have already been mentioned in connection with S\u0113ri Rama's head-dress, he caused the twelve keys to fall to the ground, and he entered the room without further obstacle.\n\nThe Princess was astonished at finding herself confronted in the King's private apartments by a stranger, and asked him whence he came. \"From the island of Kachapuri,\" said he. \"It may be seen peeping out from among the clouds, but is lost to view when the wind blows.\" \"What uneasiness of mind,\" asked the Princess, \"has brought you to my house at such an hour of the night?\"\n\n---\n\n*In the Ramayana it is Marichi, a relative and dependant of R\u0101vana, who assumes the shape of a golden deer. It is eventually overtaken and killed by Rama. When dying, Mar\u012bchi imitates the voice of Rama, and thus induces Laksamana to start off to his brother's assistance. Sita is thus left alone, and R\u0101vana gains her presence in the form of an old man.*\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 55, 1909.\nHe answered in the following stanza:\u2014\n\n\"How high soever the shoot of the plantain,\nHigher yet is the smoke of a fire;\nHigh though may be the mountain ranges,\nHigher still are the hopes I indulge.\"\n\nTo which the Princess replied:\u2014\n\n\"If the casting-net be skilfully thrown,\nThe fish are found together at the upper end of it;\nIf these words are said in earnest,\nLet us yield to fate and see what comes of it.\"\n\nHe retaliated with the following verse:\u2014\n\n\"The M\u0113ranti tree with a forked limb;\nShape the wood and make a drum of it.\nThe path that leads to death is often ventured on;\nHere I yield to fate, let what will come of it.\"\n\nThe Princess then invited him to chew betel, prefacing the invitation with Malay politeness by depreciating the quality of what she had to offer. The betel-leaves are withered, the betel-nut decayed, the gambir smoked, the lime badly prepared, and the tobacco only fit to kill insects in the garden. This ceremony over, Maharaja Duwana had no difficulty in persuading the Princess to elope with him, and he carried her off to Pulau Kachapuri.\n\nS\u0113ri Rama, in the midst of the forest on a pitch-dark night, suddenly came to a sense of the absurdity of the enterprise he and his men had embarked on, and ordered a return to the town, which they reached a little before day-break. The gate of the fort lay wide open; rushing on he found the outer and inner doors of the palace open, and passing through them he found his private apartments similarly unprotected and his consort's bed empty. One terrified old woman was found who was able to relate circumstantially what had happened in his absence. On learning the truth, the King went out into the great hall and uttered three terrible screams.\n\n\"By the noise, the lamps in seven countries were extinguished; the earth at seven cockpits cracked in fissures;\"\nseven half-formed cocoa-nuts fell to the ground; and all the women who were three months gone with child miscarried.\"\n\nOn the advice of his Chiefs, he again sent for his elder brother, Raja Laksamana, to ask for his counsel and assistance, and after consultation with him, in spite of the entreaties of the people, it was decided that the two brothers should set off to recover the missing Princess, leaving the T\u00ebm\u00ebnggong in charge of the kingdom. For three months and ten days they travelled through forests and across plains, until they reached an enormous tualang tree, the branches of which reached the clouds and the stem of which it took them seven days and nights to skirt. Thence, striking off eastward, they came to an immense plain on the shores of the ocean, and, still travelling on, they arrived at last at the foot of Mount Inggil-b\u00ebringgil. Some days were spent in a vain search for a way to ascend the precipitous sides of the mountain, and one day S\u00ebri Rama was astonished at hearing extraordinary cries and noises which seemed to come from wild animals. Raja Laksamana explained that these proceeded from the monkey tribes, the subjects of the monkey-prince, S\u00ebri Rama's own son. Following the sounds, they reached an extensive plain, where they found the monkey hosts assembled. The throng parted right and left to let the two brothers pass through, and they made their way to a large b\u00ebringin tree, where they found the monkey-prince seated in state. The latter rose and received them with the utmost respect, and asked what had brought them to that remote spot. The unfortunate S\u00ebri Rama was quite unable to reply, but Raja Laksamana explained the situation shortly, and stated their desire to ascend Mount Inggil-b\u00ebringgil in order to fix from its summit the exact whereabouts of Kachapuri, which tradition said could be seen thence, looking no larger than a dove's nest. The monkey-prince assured them that he could do all that was necessary, and S\u00ebri Rama then found his voice and addressed his son promising him anything that he might wish for, if he could only accomplish the deliverance of the Princess. The monkey said that the wish\nof his heart was to be permitted, just for once, to eat a meal with his father off the same leaf and to sleep for once in his arms. This demand S\u0113ri Rama at once agreed to, promising further to acknowledge the monkey as his son and to take him back to his kingdom if he succeeded in releasing his mother by fair and open means without descending to the fraud practised by Maharaja Duwana. The monkey was accordingly admitted to a share of S\u0113ri Rama\u2019s dinner and bed and his monkeyish misbehaviour is described. The King having kept his part of the bargain, called for the performance of his son\u2019s undertaking. The latter alleged a difficulty in finding a place to take off from in making a leap over to Kachapuri. S\u0113ri Rama suggested the large tualang tree which it had taken him seven days to walk round and the branches of which reached to the clouds. The monkey declared that it would not bear him, but at his father\u2019s request he tried and, as he foretold, the tree sank beneath him and came down with a crash. S\u0113ri Rama next suggested a plain called Kersek, but three attempts on the part of the monkey only resulted in such a disturbance of the surface of the plain that showers of sand obscured the sun and the plain itself became a lake. The next place tried was Mount Inggil-b\u0113ringgil. On the summit of this mountain the monkey found a walled fort guarded by a young Jin, who told him that this was the residence of a Jin with seven heads, who was living there in voluntary seclusion. The monkey obtained an interview with the latter, and explained the object of his visit to the mountain. He went on to the peak, but it shook so violently that huge rocks went rolling down and the Jin with seven heads called him back and he had to give up the attempt. But in his excitement he gave the mountain a blow with one hand and a great portion of it was detached and fell near the mouth of the Malacca river!* He and the Jin with seven heads then entered into a compact of mutual friendship and\n\n* Many notable rocks in India are supposed to be boulders which the monkey-hosts of Hanuman dropped while carrying them from the Himalayas to build a bridge from the mainland to Lanka.\nbrotherhood, the latter giving him a magic ring which would obtain for him anything that he wished at any time, and he, on his part, giving to the Jin a lump of frankincense which on being burned would procure the attendance of any number of monkey-warriors. The Jin explained that his retirement was owing to his rejection by Raja Shah Kobad as a suitor for the hand of the latter's daughter.\n\nAfter this adventure, the monkey returned to S\u0113ri Rama and made a fresh attempt to leap across to Pulau Kachapuri, this time from the plain Antra-b\u0113ranta. But this too failed him in the same manner as Padang K\u0113rsek had before. Then S\u0113ri Rama invited him to mount on his shoulders and thence make his jump. The monkey climbed up at once, and, to see if his father could bear him, braced up his muscles as if to leap. \"He clutched S\u0113ri Rama and, putting forth only half of his strength, brought into play all the sinews of his body eleven hundred and ninety-nine in number, and all his joints, while his eyes grew as red as the saga bean when fried, and his bristles stood up like the thorns on the jack-fruit and his pores opened like the stalk-end of a fig.\"\n\nS\u0113ri Rama had sunk up to his knees in the earth under his supernatural burden, when Raja Laksamana, seeing his danger, seized the monkey by the arms and legs and swinging him round sent him flying through space till he fell at last on an island in the midst of the sea.* There the latter called upon his friend the Jin with seven heads for help. The wish was hardly expressed when the latter stood before him, and the circumstances having been explained, the Jin took the monkey-prince on his shoulder and then supernaturally increased his stature until he was within easy reach of Maharaja Duwana's landing-place at Kachapuri. There the monkey jumped off and hid himself in the bushes. After a while forty-four handmaidens carrying water jars made their appearance.\n\n*According to the Ramayana, Hanuman leapt across the straits which separate India and Ceylon, lighting only once on a rock in the middle.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 55, 1909.\nThrough them K\u0113ra K\u0113chil learnt the reason why they came daily to fetch so much water. They told him that after Maharaja Duwana had brought Princess Sa-kuntum Bunga to his own country, he had looked up the genealogy of his house and had discovered that the Princess stood to him in the relation of daughter to father. He had thus been unable to marry her, and had given her a separate palace and establishment of her own. Here she remained secluded, shutting herself out from the light of day and bathing constantly in a brass vessel in the middle of her palace. It was for her bath that the slave-girls were constantly fetching water. On learning all this, the monkey took an opportunity of slipping a ring into one of the water-jars and then followed the girls up to the palace. The recognition of the ring by the captive Princess, and an affectionate meeting between her and her son, of course, followed. In answer to her advice to come to a peaceful understanding with Maharaja Duwana, he replied with S\u0113ri Rama\u2019s directions to overcome the enemy by sheer bravery without recourse to stratagem, and on learning that Duwana\u2019s favourite trees were a particular cocoa-nut tree and a mango tree, he went and destroyed them both.\u2020 Maharaja Duwana was furious with the perpetrator of this mischief, but the monkey, by a rapid metamorphosis, faced him in the shape of a buffalo bull and declared his mission from Raja S\u0113ri Rama. Spears and krieses were of no avail against him, and though seized and bound and cast into a huge fire, he emerged without a hair being singed. Maharaja Duwana then demanded a truce of seven days, at the expiration of which the monkey again presented himself at the balai and roused Maharaja Duwana from slumber by beating a measure on the royal drums, just as Jack the Giant Killer in the English story, announces his presence by blowing on the horn hung at the castle gate. Again was the monkey, in the shape of a buffalo bull, seized\n\nIn the Ramayana, Hanuman shows Sita a ring given to him by Rama for the purpose.\n\n\u2020In the Ramayana, Hanuman tears up the whole of an asoka grove in Lanka before returning to Rama.\nand bound by Maharaja Duwana's troops, but this time he himself advised his captors to swathe him with cotton cloth, and pour oil over it, and then to set fire to the mass. This, he said, would be sure to kill him. This was accordingly done by the order of Maharaja Duwana, with the result that the fire spread to the town of Kachapuri, which was reduced to ashes.* K\u0113ra K\u0113chil then carried off his mother and returned to the plain of Anta-b\u0113ranta, where he restored her to S\u0113ri Rama.\u2020 Maharaja Duwana warned him, however, that he would be at Tanjong Bunga seven days after him and the combat between them would be renewed there.\n\nThe return to Tanjong Bunga was accomplished amid general rejoicings, but Maharaja Duwana kept his word and attacked that kingdom seven days afterwards. The hostilities that ensued are graphically described. Blood flowed like water and as for slaughter \"the corpses fell like blades of grass in number and the bodies of huge beasts (elephants and horses used in war) lay here and there like logs of timber ready to be floated down a river.\" The glancing of the weapons, the shouts of the brave and the shrieks of the timid all come in for a share of the description. When the rival armies drew off, Maharaja Duwana found that out of seven thousand men, he had but seven hundred left. Recourse to magic only convinced him of the certainty of failure. However, by a well-directed shot from a wall-piece he brought down Raja Laksamana, who was, however, immediately cured by a potent remedy which K\u0113ra K\u0113chil fetched from Mount Inggil-b\u0113ringgil.\u2021 After this Maharaja Duwana hauled down his flags in token of defeat and humbled himself to the victorious monkey, who\n\n*Hanuman's tail is set on fire, in the Indian epic; he escapes however, and the fire communicates itself to the town of Lanka.\n\n\u2020In the Ramayana, Hanuman goes back alone after discovering S\u012bta and burning Lanka. The seize of Lanka by Rama follows and Sita is eventually delivered by Rama himself.\n\n\u2021In the Ramayana, both Rama and Laksamana are killed in the fight with Ravana, but are both restored to life a by peculiar herb which Hanuman fetches from Mount Kailasa.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 55, 1909.\nat the request of his defeated antagonist restored all the killed to life. Maharaja Duwana then returned to his own kingdom.*\n\nThe monkey-prince was now fully acknowledged by S\u0113ri Rama and the Princess as their son and heir and there were great ceremonies at the palace. At his request, they despatched a mission to the Court of Raja Shah Kobad to demand the hand of the Princess Renek Jintan in marriage of their son. The T\u0113m\u0113nggong was the ambassador, and the suit was favourably received. He returned with the answer that the marriage should take place on the very day that the monkey-prince should present himself in the kingdom of Tahwil to claim his bride.\n\nThe royal family of Tanjong Bunga at once set out for Bandar Tahwil, the monkey-troops of the bride-groom clearing a road for them through the forest. They worked with such a will every night \"from the hour of evening twilight until the rising of the morning-star and the light of the true dawn spreading slowly betokened that day was at hand\"\u2014that in a very short time the new path was ready \"like a mat spread out,\" not a single blade of grass to be seen on it. The marriage duly took place in the presence of all the Hajis, L\u0113bais, Imams and Khatibs of the place. On the third night after the wedding, the Prince, on retiring to rest, came forth from his monkey-skin and appeared in human shape. He put the skin away carefully behind a large pillow, and resumed it in the morning. This did not escape the Princess, who, after this had happened on two consecutive nights, ordered the eldest of her women to stay awake and watch\u2014using a round cocoa-nut as a pillow, so that her head would fall off it if she dozed. The betel-nut and sirih-leaf placed for the Prince's refreshment were purposely selected so as to have a stupefying effect; on the third night he divested himself, as usual, of his skin, and chewed betel before going to bed, but he at once fell into a sound sleep and the old woman jumped up and possessed her-\n\n*The siege of Lanka properly ends with the capture of the town by Rama, the decapitation of Ravana, and the recovery of Sita.\nself of the skin and burned it.* The smoke which arose from it turned into white cloth, and the ashes which were left were found to be gold.\n\nThe Prince thenceforward appears in the story under the name of Mambang Bongsu. There was, of course, great rejoicing in the two capitals in consequence of his transformation. The T\u0115m\u0115nggong was sent off to carry the good news to S\u0115ri Rama and his wife, who come at once to Bandar Tahwil to see their son. There was a second wedding, and three months were devoted to festivities. Buffaloes, oxen, goats, ducks and fowls were killed by the hundred thousand, and some idea of the magnitude of the preparations may be formed from the fact that the scrapings of the rice-pots made hillocks, the blood of the slaughtered animals formed a lake, and the hot water poured away in cooking flowed continuously like a rivulet!\n\nSoon after this Raja Shah Kobad abdicated in favour of his son-in-law Mambang Bongsu, who thenceforth reigned as Raja of Bandar Tahwil.\n\nThe only remaining episode is the advent of the Jin with seven heads, who, ignorant of all that had occurred, came with an army to demand the Princess Renek Jintan in marriage, threatening war in case of refusal. Mambang Bongsu did not wish to injure his old friend, so he made an enormous quantity of paper birds, which, by prayer to the Dewatas, he caused to be made instinct with life. These he let loose among the hosts of the Jin with seven heads, and the latter could do nothing, for as fast as one was warded off ten more came. He invoked the help of the monkey-troops by aid of the charm which K\u0115ra K\u0115chil had given him on Mount Inggil-b\u0115ringgil when they swore an oath of brotherhood, but though the monkeys arrived in thousands, they only jumped upon him and gambolled about, embarrassing him more than ever. Then Mambang Bongsu appeared, and the birds\n\n* Compare this with the incident of the burning of the enchanted Rajah\u2019s jakal-skin in the story of \u201cThe Brahman, the Jackal and the Barber.\u201d Frere\u2019s Old Deccan Days Cox finds a parallel between this and the lion-skin of Herakles. Myth. Aryan Nations I, 315. R. A. Soc., No. 55, 1909.\nand monkeys retired. He explained everything, showed the ring which he had received from the Jin on the mountain, and announced that the Princess was already his wife. All thus ended peacefully, the Jin spent a few days at the capital, and then flew away to his own country after exchanging mutual promises of alliance with Mambang Bongsu.\n\nMambang Bongsu and his Princess lived happily ever after and never failed to exchange annual embassies with S\u00ebri Rama and his consort at Tanjong Bunga.\n\nS\u00cbRI RAMA.\n\nAl kesah.

Sa-telah genap tiga bulan kerja itu, maka Raja S\u00ebri Rama dan anak raja-raja dan orang besar-besar pun berangkat ka-Bandar Tahwil. Ada pun akan Raja Shah Kobad demikian itu juga pekerjaan-nya. Telah sampai Raja S\u00ebri Rama ka-dalam neg\u00e9ri Bandar Tahwil, maka bertemu-lah kedua pehak angkatan raja itu berkera pula sa-mula tujuh hari tujoh malam lalu-lah di-satukan pengantin laki-laki dengan pengantin perempuan di atas petirana yang-kemasan bertatahkan mutu manikam berumbai-rumbaikan mutiara. Telah sudah sel\u00e9sai pekerjaan nikah kahwin itu, maka Mambang Bongsu pun kekal-lah dengan isteri-nya tuan puteri Reneck Jintan sa-tiap hari melakukan kesukaan-nya dan Raja S\u00ebri Rama pun pulang ka-neg\u00e9ri-nya Tanjong Bunga dengan sakalian-nya.\n\nArakian, maka Mambang Bongsu pun tinggal-lah didalam neg\u00e9ri Bandar Tahwil: antara beberapa lama-nya, maka Raja Shah Kobad pun pikir di-dalam hati-nya, ia pun sudah tua; \"Baik-lah neg\u00e9ri Bandar Tahwil ini aku serahkan pada anak menantu-ku Mambang Bongsu, aku sa-kadar memangku sahaja.\" Telah putus pikiran-nya yang demikian, maka ia pun seg\u00e9ra memanggil Mambang Bongsu menyerahkan segala p\u00e9rantah adat aturan neg\u00e9ri yang salah mati di-suroh bunoh yang berdosa di-pukul di-balun juga yang dosa rendam di-suroh rendam juga. Sa-telah itu, maka tetap-lah Mambang Bongsu menjadi khalifah di-dalam Bandar Tahwil. Berapa lama-nya menjadi raja itu, sa-hingga sa-tahun dua-belas bulan. Maka pada suatu hari tersebut-lah perkataan Jin kepala tujoh berk\u00e9hendakkan tuan puteri Reneck Jintan kepada Raja Shah Kobad: jika tiada di-b\u00e9ri tuan puteri itu,\nmaka di-suroh kukohkan sakalian kota parit hendak di-langgar dengan laki-laki ia hendak di-milek rata negeri Bandar Tahwil. Telah di-dengar oleh Raja Shah Kobad kehendak Raja Jin kepala tujoh yang demiikian itu, maka ia pun terlalu-lah susah hati-nya lalu mendapatkan putera-nya Mambang Bongsu hendak membala perkataan kehendak Raja Jin kepala tujoh itu. Maka kata Mambang Bongsu, \"Hal itu jangan ayahanda bersusah-susah hati; atas anakanda-lah melawan-nya; tetapi anakanda pinta hampakan tujoh buah rumah dan pinta kertas sa-buah kapal.\" Telah di-siapkan oleh Raja Shah Kobad akan kehendak anak-nya itu, maka ia pun tiada-lah apa kerja-nya membuat burong kertas malam siang hingga penuh burong kertas itu tujoh buah rumah; lalu di-kunchi-nya. Antara sa-bulan lama-nya, maka Raja Jin kepala tujoh pun sampai-lah di-luar kota. Maka ia pun berseru-seru minta lawan. \"Jika siapa laki-laki silakan mengadu laki-laki di-luar kota ini.\" Telah di-dengar oleh segala orang besar-besar segera-lah persenbahkan ka-pada Mambang Bongsu. Maka ia pun segera mengambil anak kunchi membuka peti kecil banian sakti bertatah gewang mengambil chendana janggi kemenyang barus itu seraya beryang-yang ka-pada segala dewata menchita burong itu suroh terbang pergi melawan Raja Jin kepala tujoh; sa-ekur di-tepis sa-puloh datang; sa-puloh di-tepis sa-ribu datang.

W. C. Parr and W. H. Mackray,\nOf the Federated Malay States Civil Service.\n\nThe compilers of this pamphlet were requested by Mr. D. G. Campbell, British Resident of Negri Sembilan, to prepare a summary of the Rembau Customs relating to land tenure, marriage, divorce and inheritance.\n\nIn view of the absence of any sufficient published account of Rembau, it was subsequently decided to add to the original scheme short historical and constitutional sketches of the State.\n\nThe compilers are indebted both for numerous suggestions, and for information as to the parallel customs of Naning to Mr. J. L. Humphreys, Acting District Officer, Alor Gajah; and they have to thank Mr. W. L. Conlay, Chief Police Office, Negri Sembilan, for much valuable criticism.\nChapter I. Rembau considered historically.\n\nTradition has summed up the origin and antecedents of the people of Rembau in the saying, *Gagak itam, Gagak semui, turun deri bukit berkaki empat, bangau puteh datang dari laut berkepak sayap.* \"The black crows and the grey crows descended on foot from the hills, the white egrets flew over on flapping wings from the sea.\" The crows from the hills are allegorical of the aboriginal tribes, while the white egrets typify the Menangkabau settlers, whose advent is given by local authority to the year 1388 A.D. (773rd year of the Hegira). To intermarriage between these early Sumatran fathers and the aboriginal inhabitants of the state, the Rembau *Waris* tribe traces its origin.\n\nThe tale of the occupation of Rembau by the \"Crows\" is contained in three distinct traditions connected only by the extravagant hypotheses of Malay ingenuity. The earliest nomadic band was led by Batin Chap, the younger brother of Batin Saribu Jahia, or S\u00ebri Bujai, legendary chief of the aboriginal settlers in Sungei Ujong. No details have been handed down of this first descent from the hills, but its chronological precedence is supported by the fact that upon this tradition has been grafted the story of the Dato' Raja di Gunong and the marriage of his spirit-child to Jahia Petra, a prince of the royal family of Johor. This second tradition can only be considered as a natural attempt of a false pride to erase the blot on the escutcheon of the Rembau *Waris* descent on the female side from the hill-tribes. Later tradition, by identifying Dato' Raja di Gunong with Batin Saribu Jahia, destroys the whole point of the legend; and whatever its interest as myth or literature, the tale is of little historical value.\n\nThe third and best known tradition relates in great detail the settlement in Rembau of Batin Sakudai, also called Bendarara Sakudai. His three daughters To' Mudik, To' Mengkudu\n\n---\n\n(1) cf. Newbold. *British Settlements in Malacca*, Vol. II. p. 77.\n\n(2) v. Newbold. op. cit. Vol. II. p.376. and Bland, *Aturan Sungai Ujong*. J. R. A. S. Vol. XXVIII.\nand To' Bongkal are accepted as the respective ancestors of the Klana Petra, head of the Waris Darat of Sungai Ujong (by marriage with a Pesawi man), of the Bendahara of Pahang (by marriage with a Saiyid) and of the Waris Jakun of Rembau by marriage with Lela Balang, a Menangkabau man of the Paya Bidara tribe. The Sakudai occupation thus forms the link between the aboriginal descents and the Muhammadan immigration from Sumatra.\n\nThe peaceful character of the Muhammadan settlement contrasts strongly with the history of foreign invasion in Perak and Selangor, a tale of successful piratical raids. Yet the customary saying\\(^1\\) that \"the round isle of Sumatra, and the stretch of the Malay lands are encompassed in the expanse of the Menangkabau empire,\" implies that this occupation of Rembau was regarded primarily as an expansion of the empire of Pagar Roiong, and accounts for the close adherence of the earliest settlers to the polity and customs obtaining in their mother-country. The predominant position of the Waris in the Rembau constitution, and their claim to be heirs of the soil\\(^2\\) rest solely on the right of inheritance in the direct female line\u2014a custom peculiar to the Adat Perpateh.\n\nSailing up the Rembau river the earliest band of immigrants planted two settlements in the low country (Tanah Sabelah Baroh) at Kota under To' Lela Balang, and at Padang Leleh under his brother chief, To' Laut Dalam.\n\nThe second expedition is said to have closely succeeded the first, and was led by four chiefs who with their followers selected land further away from the Rembau River (Sa-belah Darat) at Batu Hampar, Sungai Laiang, Lubok Rusa and Bintongan. The location of these earliest settlements\u2014otherwise of little interest\u2014is important as providing the historical basis for the precedence, in customary ritual and constitutional prerogative of the low country over the inland chiefs.\n\nNumerous settlers under other chiefs followed in the wake of these pioneers, and the popularity of the Rembau expedi-\n\n\\(^{(1)}\\) v. Sayings No. V.\n\n\\(^{(2)}\\) v Sayings No. XVI.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 56, 1910.\ntions finds proof in the formal division of Rembau into the Low country and the Inland districts (Tanah Sa-belah baroh: Tanah Sa-belah Darat.)\u00b9\n\nThis dividing line ran East from Bukit Blakang Parang at Ulu Ch\u00e9nong, to Permatang Gedang in the Bongek swamp, thence to Sengki at the junction of the Salah Nama and S\u00e9ri-l\u00e9mak streams, and to on the Pedas river near Bukit Melintang.\u00b2 To conform to the Sumatran model Rembau still required a Lawgiver (Undang) as head of the federated tribes.\n\nBy his marriage with To\u2019 Bongkal, a daughter of the Jakun chief Batin Sakudai, To\u2019 Lela Balang begat one son,\u00b3 Si Rama. Claiming through his mother, by Menangkabau custom, Si Rama became head of the Waris Jakun, the elder division of the Waris tribe. In him consequently met the claims to supremacy alike of the aborigines and the first Menangkabau settlers, and the consent of the Malacca Sultan, then resident in Johor, was obtained to the selection of Si Rama as Undang in Rembau, with the title of Dato\u2019 Lela Maharaja.\n\nThe Waris Jakun were known thenceforward as the Lela Maharaja family of the Waris tribe.\n\nPreviously to the first Rembau expedition To\u2019 Laut Dalam had married a Javanese woman, and was therefore unable to press for his family any claim through Jakun blood. Yet he was jealous of the supremacy of his brother chief\u2019s descendants, and on further representations to Johor he succeeded in obtaining an equal recognition for himself with To\u2019 Lela Balang, by securing the selection of the Undang in alternation from the Lela Maharaja family, and the descendants of his eldest\n\n(1) See sketch map.\n\n(2) Vide Sketch map. The boundary between Darat and Baroh ends at the Pedas stream\u2014for the land west of the Pedas is not tribal land but Tanah Waris (v. chap. II \u00a7 l.) The most Westerly point on the Rembau-Sungai Ujong boundary was Kuala Siliau. The present Rembau-Sungai Ujong boundary was fixed by Sir A. Clark after the destruction of the stockade at Bukit Tiga (Sempang Linggi) during the Rembau-Sungai Ujong-Lingga disturbances of 1874.\n\n(3) Distinct local tradition credits him also with four daughters.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\ndaughter by her marriage with Si Rama. The family of To\u2019 Laut was known thenceforward as the Waris Jawa, in allusion to the nationality of the first female ancestor. The Jawa Undang took the title of Sedia Raja.\n\nThe claim of the Sedia Raja family\u2014the Waris Jawa\u2014to rank as Waris, or heirs to the soil, is strictly invalid, according to Menangkabau custom, in that the male and not the female ancestor was of Sakai blood and though the two families are equal in prerogative, the Waris Jakun hold to this day a sentimental precedence over the Waris Jawa.\n\nThe state of Rembau was then constituted as a federation of tribes each under one or more tribal chiefs (lembaga) who in turn were subject to the Undang. But it is apparent that the real power was vested in the Lembaga. No one could live in Rembau unattached to a tribe or without increasing by his advent the importance of some tribal chief.\n\nThe new settler had no free hand in the choice of his tribe. Custom laid down strict rules for the allocation of the stranger\u2014the settler from other countries than Menangkabau. He had as the saying records his allotted place, as a boat is moored in the stream. The Jambi man was absorbed into the Batu Hampar tribe, the Javanese entered the Reduanda Jawa, the Siamese became a member of the Paya Kumboh tribe and the Kampar man joined the Suku Tanah Datar.\n\nEven the later Menangkabau settler who cleared a patch of swamp for his padi plantation or a few acres of jungle for his coconuts, brought himself, by his choice of locality, into relations with the chief of the earliest settlers in that valley. The elder chiefs, both in the low country and the inland district, secured for their tribes a sphere of influence. A settler within the definite area, irrespective of the tribe into which he was born, ranked as an adherent (anak buah) of the pioneer chief. Yet the tribe and not the chief, was the gainer for the\n\n(1) Tradition fathers 4 daughters on To\u2019 Laut, viz., Siti Hawah Samsiah, Norimah and Melidi.\n\n(2) v. Sayings No. 1.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 56, 1910.\nnew-comer owed no feudal allegiance to the lembaga's person. To this limited extent only did territorial considerations trench upon the purely tribal system of Rembau.\n\nThis privilege of the elder chiefs was guaranteed by the formation of intertribal leagues in both districts of the state. The Baroh district\u2014the district watered by the Rembau river\u2014is constituted as two leagues: (I) the league of the Four chiefs and (II) the league of the Five tribes. Of these the former only secured any territorial rights to the contracting chiefs. The league of the five tribes was a purely political organisation.\n\nI. The league of the Four chiefs (empat sa-belah baroh).\n\nThe followers of To' Lela Balang, himself a member of the Sumatran tribe of Batu Hampar, who led the first expedition from Menangkabau to Rembau, were drawn from the Batu Hampar and Mungkal tribes; while To' Laut, joint leader of the earliest Mohammedan immigration, brought with him as his special adherents, members of his own tribe, the Paya Kumboh, and of the Tiga Nenek tribe.\n\nAfter the grant of titles to To' Lela Balang and To' Laut by the Johor Raja, these two chiefs formed with the chiefs of the Mungkal and Tiga Nenek tribes, the league of the Four.\n\nThe Four chiefs stand on an axiomatic equality tempered by sentiment. To' Lela Balang and To' Laut as joint leaders of the pioneer immigration, as the respective fathers of the male founder of the Waris Jakun family and of the ultimate female ancestor of the Waris Jawa, and as the first Rembau chiefs to obtain recognition of titles from the Muhammedan Empire of the Peninsula, take precedence over the chiefs of the Mungkal and Tiga Nenek tribes. But if sentiment based on historical fact knows of elder and younger in the Four, constitutional theory and practice ignore such a distinction. Individually each of the Four wields independent authority in his tribe. Collectively the Four composed\u2014until the reform of 1831 A.D.\u2014the council of lembaga without reference to which the Undang was constitutionally unable to deliver judgment.\nin his hall of audience, (balai), or conclude any agreement binding on the state.\n\nThe formation of this league guaranteed to the Four chiefs their respective spheres of influence in the L\u00ebgong and Gadong valleys where they originally settled. It is under this contract that the Dato\u2019 Merbangsa, lembaga of the Paya Kumboh tribe, counts as his tribes-people the S\u00ebri Melenggang colonists under Maharaja Sutan, and the few Agam families, under Maharaja Jakanda, who settled later at Kampong Tanjong and Ampang Berukir in the L\u00ebgong valley.\n\nSimilarly the Tiga Batu Tribesmen who settled at the Kampong known later by the name of their tribe, within the sphere (lengkongan) of the Dato\u2019 Bangsa Balang (lembaga of the Tiga Nenek tribe) were obliged to acknowledge the supremacy of To\u2019 Bangsa Balang, to whom their own chief Lela Raja became subservient.\n\nII. The league of the Five Tribes. The league of the Five is a political organisation formed in the time of Dato\u2019 Kosil (A.D. 1795-1820) between the chiefs of the five tribes of B\u00ebduanda, Tanah Datar, Batu Hampar P\u00ebtani, Anak Acheh, and Anak Malaka, domiciled in the Baroh district.\n\nThe immediate object of the league was the reinforcement of an expedition despatched by the Dato\u2019 Perba\u2014the B\u00ebduanda chief\u2014to Naning to avenge an insult inflicted by the Mungkal Naning on a B\u00ebduanda tribeswoman.\n\nOn the successful issue of the raid, the chiefs of the five tribes, who had no part in the existing league of the Four, bound themselves by oaths at Batu Puteh, Chengkau, to exercise their constitutional functions as one body, and to tender mutual aid \u201cso long as cranes are white or crows black.\u201d\n\nIn the Darat District of Rembau the territorial influence obtained by the earliest settlers is seen in the formation of three leagues.\n\ni The league of the Four (\u00ebmpat sa-b\u00eblah darat).\nii The league of the Five upstream (B\u00ebrlima ka-hulu).\niii The league of the Nine downstream (B\u00ebrs\u00ebmbilan ka-hilir).\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 56, 1910.\nI. The league of the Four (empat sa-belah darat).\n\nThe league of the Four forms the Darat counterpart of the empat sa-belah baroh: and was utilised by the Undang Dato' Nganit, in A.D. 1831, to strengthen his council of tribal chiefs during the friction with the S\u00ebri Menanti Raja.\n\nThe Darat district was opened up by four tribes: the Paya Kumboh under To' Laut Dalam, the S\u00ebri Lemak under To' Puteh, the Batu B\u00eblang under To' Baginda Petra and the S\u00ebri Melenggang under To' Budi. The three former chiefs settled respectively at the foot of the hills overlooking the Sungai Laiang, Lubok Rusa, and Bintongan valleys. To' Budi left the foot hills and founded his settlement in the board Batu Hampar valley near Tanjong Sena.\n\nThe spheres of the three chiefs contrasted thus with the settlement which To' Budi founded as the upstream and downstream divisions of the Darat district. The terms upstream (ka-hulu) and downstream (ka-kilir) bore reference to no one river, but to every stream\u2014the Sungai Laiang, the S\u00ebpri, the Bintong, the Ayer Hitam\u2014watering the Darat district. A line drawn from Bukit Blakang Parang to Batu Menunggu at Sungai Laiang, and thence westwards to Tunggul Merbau, Durian Hijau and Tunggul Chachak and on to the junction of the Ayer Hitam and S\u00ebpri streams formed the boundary between the two divisions. Upstream (ka-hulu) the Paya Kumboh, S\u00ebri Lemak, and Batu B\u00eblang were paramount; while To' Budi enjoyed all the downstream (hilir) portion as his sphere of influence.\n\nThe subsequent advent of Tiga Batu tribesmen to Hulu Bintongan, and of Tanah Datar settlers to the Lubok Rusa valley merely swelled the importance of the Batu B\u00eblang and S\u00ebri Lemak tribes. But while the Tiga Batu folk with their chief, Nang Besar, acquiesced in the supremacy of Dato' Andika, the Batu B\u00eblang Lembaga, they did not, like the Tanah Datar settlers, lose their tribal isolation, but formed under To Andika, a separate tribe with a full tribal constitution.\n\n(1) vide map.\nII. The league of the Five upstream. (*Lima Suku ka-hulu*). Later immigration added two tribes to the colonists of the upstream division of the Darat district. In the time of Dato\u2019 Uban\u2014circa 1645 A.D.\u2014B\u00ebduanda Jakun and Batu Hampar Bidara colonists from Johor settled in the upper valley of the S\u00ebpri. The upstream division thus became the home of five Darat tribes. Their five chiefs formed the league of the Five. The paramount position of the three pioneer chiefs was thereby confirmed, but independence was also secured to the two lembaga of the later immigration, who by settling at S\u00ebpri had avoided encroaching on the spheres of the three chiefs at Sungai Laiang, Lubok Rusa, and Bintongan.\n\nIII. The league of the Nine downstream (*B\u00ebrs\u00ebmbilan ka-hilir*).\n\nThe downstream division of the Darat district where To\u2019 Budi was established, attracted Mungkal settlers from Naning, Tanah Datar emigrants from Sumatra, and a branch of the S\u00ebri M\u00eblenggang Empat Ibu from Sungai Ujong. The formal alliance between these tribes and the S\u00ebri M\u00eblenggang under To\u2019 Budi\u2014known as the league of the Nine\u2014declared the darat downstream division to be constituted of three tribes, four heads (*tua*), To\u2019 Mendelika of the S\u00ebri M\u00eblenggang Empat Ibu, To\u2019 Maharaja Inda of the Tanah Datar, To\u2019 Ngiang of the Mungkal, and To\u2019 Dagang of the S\u00ebri M\u00eblenggang Menangkabau; and one lembaga, chief of the S\u00ebri M\u00eblenggang tribe:\u00b9 and thus secured the precedence of the pioneer chief. The origin of the title by which the league is known\u2014The Nine (*B\u00ebrs\u00ebmbilan*)\u2014is stated by Hervey\u00b2 to be \u201cthat they (sic) descended from nine mothers in the three sukus\u2014four in the S\u00ebri M\u00eblenggang, three in the Mungkal and two in the Tanah Datar.\u201d This theory does not tally with established facts. There are not three but two main families (*p\u00ebrut*) in the tribe Mungkal Darat.\u00b3\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 The present lembaga of the Seri Melenggang tribe Darat is not descended from To\u2019 Budi but is of the Empat Ibu branch of the Tribe.\n\n\u00b2 vide J.R.A.S. S.B. vol. XIII. June 1884.\n\n\u00b3 vide appendix IV. Sub item Darat.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 56, 1910.\nLocal tradition ascribes the title of the Nine to the dispatch by the chiefs of the *Darat Sa-b\u00e8lah Hilir* of a force commanded by nine chiefs\\(^1\\) to the aid of the Dato\u2019 Klana Kawal during the Rawa invasion of Sungai Ujong in 1820 A.D.; but this expedition would appear long subsequent to the formation of the league.\n\nAgainst this consolidation of tribal power, extra-tribal institutions could make no headway. The Shah-Bandar\u2014a *Waris* chief of early Johor creation\u2014soon lost, if indeed he ever possessed in Rembau, the extensive privileges enjoyed by his counterpart in the state of Sungai Ujong as head of the *Waris-di-Ayer*. The very rights of the office of Penghulu Dagang, once held by a chief of the S\u00ebri M\u00e9lenggang Menangkabau, tribe (*Sa\u2019 b\u00e9lah Darat*) are a matter of conjecture, and the title exists only in the lively recollection of his descendants, whom the supremacy of the tribes has reduced to the rank of Penglima, and whose grand heritage has shrunk to the sinecure of chief executioner.\n\nThus far, attention has been confined to the internal politics of Rembau, but from a very early date the Rembau federation of tribes formed one state within the old Sakai confederacy of the Negri Sembilan, under the Suzerainty of Johor.\n\nThe members of this confederacy are stated by Newbold, in his work on \u201cThe British Settlements in Malacca,\u201d to have been: Sungai Ujong, Rembau, Johol, Jelebu, Segamat, Naning, Klang, *Ulu Pahang* and *Jelai*.\n\nThe inclusion of the two last states in the list has long been the subject of criticism. It is argued that *Jelai* (in Pahang), and *Ulu Pahang* are separated by too vast a distance from the other seven states to have ever formed integral parts of the confederacy. Again the limits of Klang as a member of the Negri Sembilan have long been in dispute.\n\nTo solve the difficulty in regard to *Jelai* it has been\n\n\\(^{(1)}\\) From To\u2019 Mendelika, (1) Juan Pahlawan, (2) Genta di-awan; From To\u2019 Ngiang, (3) Raja Limada, (4) Raja Nang Seti, (5) Panglima Dalam; From To\u2019 Maharaja Inda, (6) Genta di Langit, (7) Memprana Seti, (8) Panglima Jahia; From To\u2019 Dagang, (9) Panglima Bongsu.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nsuggested that the reference is not to the J\u00e9lai in Pahang, but to the tiny state of Inas (or J\u00e9lai) adjoining S\u00ebri Menanti. This theory as failing to recognise that Inas is merely a part of the State of Johol, was discredited by Hervey in his paper on Rembau:\u00b9 nor does the suggestion account for the title of the Jelai Undang, Maharaja Perba, still held by the chief of Jelai, Pahang.\n\nThe Hon. Martin Lister took another route out of the difficulty. In his paper on \"The Constitution of the Negri Sembilan,\"\u00b2 while retaining Jelai Pahang, he substituted Pasir Besar, a district of Muar, Johor, for Ulu Pahang.\n\nThe retention of J\u00e9lai he justified by a theory, which was rather hinted at than definitely formulated in his paper. By discarding a chronological arrangement of events, and omitting to record the Johor suzerainty over the Negri Sembilan confederacy, he led his readers to infer that the \"Sakai confederacy\" preceded the advent of Mohammedan settlers in the up-country districts of the Peninsula. He laid great emphasis on the Batin origin common to the nine members of the confederacy, and thence inferred that the inclusion of J\u00e9lai was due to the original opening up of that state by the Batin.\n\nHis theory may be thus stated:\u2014That only Batin (aborigines) inhabited the up-country districts of the peninsula, at the time the confederacy was formed; that all the nine members were of Batin origin; that the State of J\u00e9lai was of Batin origin; that therefore it was a member of the confederacy.\n\nWhile reserving the chronological point raised by this theory for later consideration, it may be remarked that the exclusion of Ulu Pahang from the confederacy, except on the ground that no one lived in Ulu Pahang at the time the confederacy was formed, is inexplicable on this theory. Tradition relates that Batin Sakudai settled in Pahang\u2014a bald statement that does not point to J\u00e9lai as the site of the settle-\n\n\u00b9 vide J.R.A.S., S.B.

Again, the constitution of none of the nine states shows that the Batin element, however great its internal importance, as in Johol and Sungai Ujong, received any consideration from Johor. The title of Undang, granted to the supreme Chief in each State, was held not by the Batin but by a Mohammedan settler; and Johor dealt only with the Undang.\n\nBut the theory is also open to chronological objection. At the time of loss of Malacca to Albuquerque (1511 A.D.) the Mohammedan Empire of Malacca had no rival in the Peninsula other than the Siamese Kingdom. Hence the exclusion of Perak from a confederacy of inland states of the Peninsula subject to Johor at once attracts attention. Now Perak passed by conquest under the sway of Achih in 1530 A.D. in the reign of Mansur Shah, the last of the Johor (Malacca) Raja on the Perak throne. The confederacy therefore was formed subsequently to 1530 A.D.\n\nAgain, the formation of the confederacy involved the grant of the title of Undang to the paramount Chief in each contracting state. Rembau tradition relates that the office of Undang has existed for some 360 years prior to the election of the living holder in 1905 A.D. The date of the formation of the confederacy may therefore be given to the 3rd or 4th decade of the 16th century A.D.\n\nThis date disproves the first assumption of Lister's theory. But the question of the inclusion of Jelai and Ulu Pahang in the Negri Sembilan confederacy under Johor is strictly a geographical problem; and would appear to have arisen from a confusion between the present content of the geographical terms Ulu Pahang and Johor, and their meaning in the first half of the 16th century A.D.\n\nIn 1540 A.D., Johor nominally included, with the exception of the European Settlement at Malacca, the whole peninsula South of Kemaman on the East and the Bernam river on the West. As late as 1785 A.D., the fugitive Johor Raja, Mahmud Raiat Shah, in his appeal to Captain Light, Resident at Penang, styled himself 'the possessor of the royal thrones\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nof Johor and Pahang, and all the districts subordinate thereto.\\(^1\\)\n\nThe Negri Sembilan as constituted under Johor was a confederacy of all the inland states of Sakai origin in the Peninsula South of Kemaman and the Bernam river accessible to one another but removed by distance from the immediate control of the Johor Raja.\n\nIn 1540 A.D., Ulu Pahang must necessarily mean that tract watered by the Pahang river at the utmost point on the river of Johor influence. The up-stream limit of the Pahang river today is situated at Kuala Tembeling. It was probably so in the 16th century. At Kuala Tembeling, the Pahang river ceases to exist and becomes on the left the Tembeling, and on the right the Jelai. This was probably the case also in the 16th century. The tract immediately below Kuala Tembeling, which may be taken to be the Ulu Pahang of the 16th century, is easily accessible from the States of Johol, of Jelebu and from Ulu Segamat. To this district of Ulu Pahang, Jelai is the immediate up-stream neighbour on the broad Pahang waters.\n\nIt is clear from his account of the Journey of Mr. Grey to Ulu Pahang in 1827 A.D.\\(^2\\) that Ulu Pahang did not mean to Newbold, the area at present included in the administrative district of Ulu Pahang. The route taken by Mr. Grey through Rembau and Jempol down the Sereting and Bera rivers to their junction with the Pahang river, lay wholly outside the modern Ulu Pahang, but would traverse the 16th century state of Ulu Pahang. The remark with which Newbold introduces his description of Johol,\\(^3\\) \"Johol is bounded on the North by Ulu Pahang,\" is only true of Ulu Pahang in the suggested 16th century definition of that term.\n\nThe inclusion of Klang in the confederacy of the Negri Sembilan under Johor has never been questioned; but the extent of the 16th century state of Klang is conjectural.\n\n---\n\n(1) v. Newbold. op. cit. Vol. II, p. 48.\n(2) v. Newbold op. cit. Vol. II, pp. 135-6.\n(3) v. Newbold op. cit. Vol. II, p. 138.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 56, 1910.\nCertainly Klang cannot be identified with the modern state of Selangor. The Negri Sembilan under Johor was a confederation of inland states and the coast line of modern Selangor was opened up by Bugis invaders who founded the Bugis line of Selangor Raja. (Circa 1715 A.D.)\u00b9 Native tradition quoted by Newbold,\u00b2 gives the right bank of the Klang river to the Malays, the left to the Jakun, and the coast to the Bugis. The sphere of influence of the Orang Kaia Kechil, the Undang of Klang, was confined under the Mohammedan Sultanate of Selangor, according to the same authority, to the upper reaches of the Klang river. Klang then as a state in the \"Sakai confederacy\" of the Negri Sembilan probably included only the Sakai and Mohammedan settlements radiating from the hulu of the Klang river.\n\nThe supremacy of the Johor Raja over the confederacy finds only spasmodic expression in history and tradition. Yet the internal politics of Rembau provide one striking, if solitary, instance of the deference of the Rembau Chiefs to direct orders from Johor.\n\nSultan Abdul Jalil Shah, profiting indirectly by the fall of the Achinese Empire in 1637 A.D., and directly by the aid of the Dutch, brought the influence of Johor in the peninsula to its greatest height in the latter half of the 17th century. The contemporary Undang in Rembau was To' Uban (Circa 1645-1691), the fifth in the list of Rembau Undang, a Waris Jakun.\n\nNow the three immediate successors of To' Uban all belonged to the family Waris Jawa, Sedia Raja and the rule of the alternation of families (giliran p\u0113rut), governing the appointment of the Undang, was suspended at the elections of the 7th and 8th Undang.\n\nThis breach of constitutional practice is the more remarkable that even during the late 18th and early 19th cen-\n\n\u00b9 v. Maxwell. The Ruling family in Selangor. J.R.A.S., S.B. Vol. XXII, p. 322.\n\u00b2 v. Newbold op. cit. Vol. II, pp. 27-30.\nturies when might was the determining factor in the election of the Undang, the alternation of families was rigidly observed. Native tradition throws the direct responsibility for this interference with the Rembau constitution on the Johor Raja. By refusing to allow his daughter to enter the household of a Johor prince, To\u2019 Uban drew down upon his family\u2014the Waris Jakun\u2014sentence of disqualification for the office of Undang. Respect for the authority of Johor was sufficiently strong in Rembau to ensure compliance with this arbitrary order for at least forty years. To\u2019 Sabut (or Suboh) the 8th Undang held office for some forty years and not until 1750 A.D.,\u2014when the Malay Sultan of Johor was merely a Bugis nominee,\u2014did a Waris Jakun again hold the office of Undang in Rembau.\n\nThe institutions, if any, whereby Johor sought to maintain her control over the confederacy in its earlier years, are conjectural, and have left no trace in the constitution of Rembau. Tradition tells of a resident ambassador appointed by Johor, with the title of Dato Ganti Maharaja,\u2014an official with whom the chief of the Anak Malaka tribe in Rembau, who bears at the present day the same title, traces kinship; but no event is recorded displaying the exercise of this ambassadorial authority.\n\nOnly when the Dutch Company, in securing its purely commercial existence, came into contact with the Johor dependencies of Rembau, Naning, Sungei Ujong, and Klang, is historical evidence obtainable as to the methods of Johor control over the confederacy. In 1646 A.D., shortly after the expulsion of the Portuguese from Malacca, the Dutch concluded a friendly and commercial pact with the Rembau Chiefs, whose possession of the territory of Simpang Linggi, at the junction of the Rembau and Linggi Rivers, gave them control over the sole waterway for the export of tin from Jelebu and Sungei Ujong. This pact finds a parallel in the Dutch treaties of 1650, and 1655 A.D., with the Sultan of Perak, and was the first of several agreements culminating in the treaty of 1759 A.D., with Rembau and Klang. That treaty conclud-\ned by Cremer and Veerbrugge on behalf of the Dutch Governor, secured to the Dutch the monopoly of the tin-buying trade at Linggi.\n\nThe correspondence which preceded the ratification of that treaty, and is still preserved in the Dutch records at Malacca, throws considerable light on the methods of Johor rule in the two contracting states. The preliminary negotiations for the treaty of 1759 were conducted, on behalf of Rembau, by one Raja Adil, who lived at Pedas in the Darat district of Rembau, and by the Undang, or, as the letters style him, the Penghulu.\n\nThe Dutch letters record that on 29th September 1757, Raja Adil and the Undang of Rembau, together with the Penghulu of Klang and one Raja Lela as representatives of Klang, visited Malacca, but returned without effecting anything, on the ground that they \"had no power.\"\n\nFrom the same correspondence it is to be inferred that the authority of the Johor representative at Pedas did not extend to the neighbouring state of Klang.\n\nBut the system of resident Rajas failed to guarantee the control of Johor over the confederacy. About the year 1770 A.D., four states, Sungai Ujong, Rembau, Johol and Ulu Muar\u2014the last originally but a part of Johol,\u2014revolted. The causes of this revolt are obscure.\n\nSungai Ujong tradition\\(^1\\) denies that there was a war. It tells of a peaceful renunciation by Sultan Abdul Jalil Shah in favour of the Menangkabau Sultan, of suzerain rights over the following four states of the confederacy\u2014Jelebu, Sungai Ujong, Johol and Naning.\n\nThis tale presents many difficulties. The reference cannot be to Abdul Jalil Shah III, for his defeat by Daing Perani in 1722 A.D., opened the way to Bugis ascendancy in Johor; and the advent of the Menangkabau Raja admittedly foreshadowed the decline of the Bugis influence in the confederacy. Again, that Abdul Jalil Shah IV\u2014known also as Ahmat\n\n\\(^{(1)}\\) vide Bland, Aturan Sungai Ujong J. R. A. S., S. B. vol XXVIII, Aug. 1895.\nRaiat Shah\u2014an infant puppet placed by the Bugis on the Johor throne, (Circa 1665, A.D.), under the regency of Daing Kamboja\u2014could effect such a partition of his empire, is equally incredible. Nor does Jelebu tradition\\(^1\\) which tells of a secession of Jelebu, Sungai Ujong, Johol, and Rembau corroborate the story.\n\nRembau tradition knows only of a war, known as the first Rawa war, (Prang Rawa), not of its causes. But an appeal from the Dato\u2019 Naning to the Dutch for arms\u2014a request that was answered only by advice to remain neutral\u2014implies that a sense of danger from the Bugis was rife in a portion, at least, of the confederacy.\n\nThe historical importance of the revolt lies in the resort of the four revolting states to the Menangkabau Sultan of Pagar Roiong. Daing Kamboja who neither received, nor could have expected Dutch aid, was defeated and retired to Rhio in 1773 A.D. From that date Johor ceased to control the politics of the Negri Sembilan. Although the Rembau Undang sent a contingent to aid Raja Haji, in his attack on Malacca in 1784 A.D., all ties with Johor were severed. Rembau had no longer her Raja in Johor (*berraja ka-Johor.*)\n\nThe advent of Raja Mel\u00e9war, as being the first deputed suzerain from Pagar Roiong, is naturally beset with divers traditional embellishments.\n\nThe adventures of the delegates from the four states to Sumatra, their stay at Siak, their deception by Raja Kabib, and their triumphant return with the apostolic prince, to whom even ocean paid her tribute\u2014two richly chased cannon, heaved up from the depths by a colossal wave\u2014form a favourite theme of local chroniclers.\n\nAfter his installation at Penajis in 1773 A.D., as suzerain over the four allied states, under the title of Yang di Pertuan Besar, Raja Mel\u00e9war took up his residence at Sri Menant in the State of Ulu Muar. The system of a resident Raja\n\n---\n\n(1) vide J.R.A.S.S.B. vol. XIV, p. 337. Jelebu by H. A. O\u2019Brien.\n\n(2) v. Appendix I, Saying IV.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 56, 1910.\nwas thus adopted by the Menangkabau Sultan as the basis of his rule in the peninsula.\n\nIt is worthy of remark that the Menangkabau suzerainty was exercised over an alliance of four States only. There was no suggestion at this date of a \"Negri Sembilan\" (nine States) for Naning had fallen under Dutch influence, and the other 4 states of the Sakai Confederacy did not revolt. Jelebu obtained an independent charter from Sultan Mahmud Shah,\u00b9 a confession of weakness on the part of Johor; Klang left the confederacy to fall under the sway of The Bugis Chiefs of Selangor, while their geographical position merged Ulu Pahang, Jelai and Segamat in the respective kingdoms of Pahang and Muar.\n\nThe decadence of the Johor Sultanate after the withdrawal of the Bugis from Rhio in 1785, the lack of a forward policy in the Dutch administration, preoccupied with the competition of the English East India Company, relaxed the tie uniting the 4 contracting States. Although Raja Mel\u00e9war on his death was replaced by Raja Adil, another deputed prince from Menangkabau, and he again in 1795 A.D., by Raja Itam, Rembau tradition records no act of interference in Rembau politics by the Menangkabau suzerain in the 18th century.\n\nIn 1795 A.D., the British on taking possession of Malacca concluded a commercial and friendly pact with Rembau, as a separate state. The document does not mention either the Yang di Pertuan or any of the 3 other States of the confederacy.\n\nAt that time To' Pekak was Undang in Rembau, but as he was unable, through infirmity, to make the journey to Malacca, he appointed Kosil a waris chief, as his deputy. On his return from Malacca, Kosil refused to lay aside his delegated power, and succeeded by force of arms in securing the deposition of To' Pekak, and his own installation as Undang. The Raja-at Sri Menanti made no sign, and his apparent indifference to the personality of the Undang contrasts strongly with the action of the Johor suzerain in the time of To' Uban.\n\n\u00b9 v. O'Brien Jelebu, J.R.A.S. XIV. p. 337, Dec. 1884.\nWithin ten years Rembau had demanded and again obtained, with the assent of the three other Law givers, (Undang), a resident Raja. In 1800-5 Raja Hasil son of the 2nd Yang de Pertuan Besar was installed as Yang di Pertuan Muda at Bandar. In 1812 Raja Haji, a son of the Yam Tuan Muda eloped with the daughter of To\u2019 Bogok then Undang, and on war ensuing between Rembau and Raja Hasil, the Undang secured as allies the Dato\u2019 Linggi\u00b9 and Raja Ali, stepson of the 3rd Yam Tuan Besar and a noted freelance. The combination proved too strong for the Yam Tuan, and on the defeat of Raja Hasil, Raja Ali in 1815, intrigued himself into the position of Yam Tuan Muda.\n\nIn 1819, after the recession of the British from Malacca, the Dutch Company protected its trading interests by concluding a commercial agreement with Raja Ali, the Undang, and the four great tribal chiefs, who were styled the administrators of the kingdom of Rembau; but who, sincerely or otherwise, admitted themselves to \u201clie under the protection of the supreme Government of Netherlands India.\u201d The Yang di Per Tuan Besar, Lenggang Laut\u2014was not a signatory and is not mentioned throughout the treaty.\n\nTwo years of intrigue followed the death of Raja Lenggang Laut in A.D., 1824. His successor from Menangkabau, Raja Laboh, was installed at Penajis in 1826, but the confederate states were at war within 3 years. Rembau was invaded by the Yang di Per Tuan Besar, and the 3 Undang, while To\u2019 Klana Kawal of Sungai Ujong brought with him the Linggi chief To\u2019 Muda Katas\u00b2 and a large Rawa following. Certain of the Rembau (Sri Melenggang)\u00b3 chiefs supported the invaders, but the excesses of Raja Krejan, a Bugis captain, split up the allies camp and after three years of desultory skirmishing the expedition retreated, leaving the local rebels to pay the penalty of their treachery by the loss of their rank as lembaga.\n\n\u00b9 The Dato Linggi was chief of a Bugis Settlement founded at Linggi circa 1780 A.D.\n\u00b2 Succeeded Dato Linggi Ahman with the new title of To\u2019 Muda Linggi 1824 A.D.\n\u00b3 Dato Dagang, To\u2019 Mengkota, cf. Chap. II, Sub lembaga.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 56. 1910.\nIn 1832, Raja Laboh, the last of the deputed princes, was driven out of the country and fled to Sumatra. A year before, his official existence had been ignored by the Supreme Government of British India, though his presence in Malacca was recognised, in concluding an agreement with Raja Ali, the Undang, (To\u2019 Nganit)\u00b9 and the Four chiefs, acknowledging them as \u201cgoverning the country of Rembau and its dependencies\u201d and in treating with the authorities of Rembau and its dependencies as an independent state.\n\nEarly in 1832 the British authorities in Malacca ratified the agreement of 1831 by a formal treaty between \u201cthe English Government and the Rembau Chiefs as a Government of itself excluding all others.\u201d\n\nConsiderable importance attaches to this document historically. For Rembau Raja Ali made his mark, the seal of Saiyid Shaban was affixed, and there also signed the Undang Lela Maharaja (To\u2019 Nganit), and Eight heads of tribes. In January 1832 then it is clear that Raja Ali, in the absence of any royal rival, posed as Yam Tuan Besar, and had forced from Rembau some measure of recognition for the claim of his son-in-law (Saiyid Shaban) as Yang di Per Tuan Muda.\n\nThese claims were bitterly opposed in Rembau as the descent of Saiyid Shaban entirely failed to justify his pretensions.\u00b2 He was not of royal blood, and although the daughter of Raja Ali was guilty of no morganatic alliance in wedding a descendant of the Prophet, she could not by her marriage confer on her husband the right to equal rank with a Raja.\n\nThe signatures of the Eight Tribal chiefs point to, and date, an important constitutional reform. The admission of the four great \u201cdarat\u201d chiefs to the council of Lembaga, in whom vested the ultimate power in Rembau, marks an advance in the consolidation of the state.\n\n\u00b9 Newbold op. cit. Vol. II, p. 132, spells this chief\u2019s name Rennie!\n\u00b2 He was the son of an Arab Saiyid Ibrahim by his concubine Sri Kamis a Malay slave girl belonging to Zainudin capitan Malaiu in Malacca v. Newbold Vol. II, p. 131.\nIn September of the same year Raja Ali was duly installed as Yang di Per Tuan besar, and secured for Saiyid Shaban, who had won his way into the good graces of the Malacca authorities, reluctant recognition as Yam Tuan Muda of Rembau. No sooner, however, had Raja Ali retired to Sri Menanti than blood ties involved Rembau in a feud of the Linggi chiefs. A bribe induced To' Nganit to change sides and oppose his former ally, Nakhoda Lobah, who was supported by both Raja Ali and the Yam Tuan Muda. Then as the local chronicler records, \"there came this thought to Dato' Nganit, fighting cocks with fighting cocks and quails with quails,\" and he too invoked a royal ally\u2014Tungku Radin of Sri Menanti. In 1834 Raja Ali fled before this alliance, while his son-in-law retired to Tampin, the District Of Rembau assigned him in 1832 for his maintenance.\n\nIn 1834, Tungku Radin was elected Yang di Per Tuan Besar at Sri Menanti: but at his death, Rembau held aloof from the war of succession provoked by a son of Tungku Beringin, and with the lapse of the Office of Yam Tuan Muda, her politics were relieved of the Rajas' influence until the era of British protection.\n\nIf undue importance appears to have been accorded to the details of these petty wars and raids, their record at least refutes the accepted contention, that the existence of suzerain at Sri Menanti spelt peace in the confederacy. A common danger (from the Bugis) gave birth to the Menang-\n\n---\n\n(1) In 1832, he was rewarded for his action in the Naning war with a freehold plot of land in Malacca town.\n\n(2) Linggi is bermak kapada Rembau, berbapa kapada Sungai Ujong.

Remove the danger, let export trade over a single water-way pit the interests of one state against another and all elements of dissolution are to hand. But these divisions brought no \"rule\" to the suzerain. The Prang Rawa he fostered in 1815 resulted only in the consolidation of the waris Rembau by the introduction of the equal dividend to the Eight kampongs:\\(^1\\) and the essay of Tungku Radin in weakening the Undang by the creation of the Raja di Raja\\(^2\\) ignored the axiom that not the waris but the lembaga are the constitutional enemies of the Undang.\n\nAs the position of Undang Rembau, which in early years presented few attractions, became, with the growth and development of the state, a prize worth winning, claimants to office multiplied.\n\nIn the later years of his Undangship To' Nganit's position was challenged unsuccessfully by Pakat, a Mentri of the Jawa waris;\\(^3\\) and on the death of To' Akhir in 1871, some months elapsed before To' Haji Sahil proved victorious over Haji Mustapha, a waris of kampong Gadong, whose claims were strongly supported by Haji Abdul Karim, chief of the Tiga Nenek tribe.\n\nThese internal dissensions so strengthened the tribal chiefs at the expense of the Undang that in 1877 Dato' Haji Sahil attempted to entrench his position by a foreign alliance: and concluded an abortive agreement with Johor acknowledging Sultan Abu-Bakar then on a visit to Rembau, as his suzerain. His inability to obtain the consent or signatures of the Eight tribal chiefs to this contract is fatal to its validity.\n\nHis subsequent policy of promoting raids on Tampin, as a sop to Cerberus, failed to satisfy the Lembaga, and as recourse to Sri Menanti, shaken by a recent invasion of the Dato' Klana of Sungai Ujong, was impracticable, Haji Sahil\n\n---\n\n(1) v. chap.

Vol. II, p. 133, for an early (1832) reference to this man.\nhad no option but to acquiesce in British intervention as the inevitable remedy for this \"plague of wars.\"\n\nIn 1883 the Eight chiefs proceeded to Malacca, laid their complaints before Sir Frederick Aloysius Weld, Governor of the Straits Settlements, and with his assent deposed Haji Sahil, electing as his successor S\u0113run bin Sidin, a waris kampong Tengah.\\(^1\\)\n\nThe ensuing treaty signed on 31st March 1883,\\(^2\\) secured to Rembau the right of referring questions affecting the peace of the state to the Governor of the Straits Settlements\u2014and paved the way for the agreement of 17th September, 1887, whereby the Undang and chiefs surrendered the administration of Rembau to H. E.'s officers in consideration of receiving one third of the total yearly revenues of the state.\n\nTo facilitate administration, the chiefs of Rembau, Johol and Sri Menanti with their dependencies agreed in 1889 to form a confederation \"to be called the Negri Sembilan\" and formally asked for a British Resident.\n\nExcept in name, this Federation bears little resemblance to the Sakai confederacy of Nine States under Johor. The tale of nine was completed only by the inclusion as separate States of the tributary districts of Inas, Jempol, Gunong Pasir, and Terachi. The nine contracting chiefs stood on no common basis of influence or independence, and pledged their loyalty to no one overlord. This Federation lasted only 6 years.\n\nThe amalgamation of Sungei Ujong and Jelebu, under British protection, with the \"Negri Sembilan, Old\"\\(^3\\) was\n\n---\n\n(1) Ob. 29.1.1905.

The Treaty was signed by Saiyid Hamid a \"Ruler of Tampin.\"\n\n(3) This peculiar term has been retained in the text on account of its use in collection of Negri Sembilan laws and Gazette to describe the federation created by the Treaty of 1889.\n\nR. A Soc., No. 56, 1910.\nratified in an agreement with the Governor of the Straits Settlements signed on 8th August 1895, which saw the birth of yet another \"Negri Sembilan\" confederacy, composed of six States, Sri Menanti, Johol, Rembau, Sungai Ujong, Jelebu, Tampin,\u2014no literal meaning attaching to the style of the confederacy.\n\nBy clause 3 \"authorising no chief to exercise any other power or authority in respect of any state than that which he now possesses\" the agreement confirmed the political independence, under British protection, of the contracting chiefs.\n\nIn 1898 the four Undang of Jelebu, Sungei Ujong, Rembau, and Johol signed a declaration admitting the nominal suzerainty of the Sri Menanti chief over the '95 confederacy. The Yam Tuan Besar of Sri Menanti became Yang di Pertuan Negri Sembilan and was thereby constituted arbitrator in any dispute between the several Undang, but obtained no power of intervention in the internal politics of any of the contracting States.\n\nBy the specific inclusion of Inas, Gunong Pasir and Terachi the '98 agreement gave a semblance of reality to the style \"Negri Sembilan.\" The revival of the Negri Sembilan, by the agreement of '98, did not affect Rembau relations to the British protectorate as defined in the Treaty of 1883 A.D.\nChapter II.\n\nSection 1, \"The Tribes,\" (Suku).\n\nThe Federation known as the state of Rembau comprises twelve tribes. Each of these tribes forms theoretically a separate entity, the members of which owe no allegiance to any extra-tribal chief other than the Undang.\n\nThe government of a tribe is vested in\n\n(i) The officers in the tribe (Orang besar);\u2014\n\n(ii) The \"Elder\" (ibu bapa), whose authority is normally co-extensive with one of the original families of the tribe.\n\n(iii) The tribal Chief (lembaga)\u2014to whom the elders are responsible.\n\nThe division of Rembau into the low country (baroh), and inland (darat) districts, (vide chapter I, p. 4) implied a corresponding divorce between the different settlements of individual tribes on either side of the boundary. A darat tribal Chief has no authority in the baroh settlement of his own tribe, nor a baroh chief in the darat district. But the partition of the darat district (vide Chapter I, p. 9) into the upstream (hulu) and downstream (hilir) divisions implies no such divorce between tribal settlements of one tribe in either division of the darat district.\n\nThe twelve tribes resident in Rembau bear the following names:\u2014\n\n1. Beduanda or Waris,\n2. Batu Hampar,\n3. Paya Kumboh,\n4. Mungkal (Mungkar),\n5. Tiga Nenek,\n6. Seri Melenggang,\n7. Seri Lemak,\n8. Batu Belang,\n9. Tanah Datar,\n10. Anak Aceh,\n11. Anak Malaka,\n12. Tiga Batu.\n\nIdentical in constitution and government the twelve tribes are not only differentiated by various degrees of precedence, as shewn in the relative importance of the tribal chiefs (vide appendix IV), but are interrelated by ties of blood, or\nthe bonds of specific alliances, arising from the geographical distribution of tribal settlements, or danger to a common interest.\n\nThe historical consideration of the tribal settlements has already dealt with the geographical alliances of (i) the four baroh chiefs (ii) the four darat chiefs (iii) the 5 upstream in the darat district and (iv) the league of the 3 darat tribes downstream; while (v) the league of the 5 Baroh tribes has been shown to have a political rather than a geographical origin.\n\nBut the formation of these five leagues, while limiting the independent action of the contracting chiefs, did not affect the constitution of the tribe, its form of government or the inherited rights (p\u0113saka) of the tribesfolk.\n\nThose rights flowed from the theoretical independence of each tribe and the tribal customs provide the means for their preservation.\n\nPermanent residence in Rembau necessitated entrance into some one of the twelve tribes of the federation. But inclusion in a tribe, while entailing obligations does not confer full tribal rights. Only a full member of a tribe is eligible for election to the post of ibu-bapa or l\u0113mbaga, or can demand the higher marriage fee obtaining in certain of the elder tribes. Full membership depends on the ability of a claimant to trace his descent back to the founder of one of the original families (perut). Thus the tribe Paya Kumboh (Baroh) has adherents living at Gadong, at Batang Nyamor, and at S\u0113m\u0113rbok, none of whom are eligible to hold the office of To\u2019 Merbangsa, the tribal chief, for their ancestors came from the upcountry settlement of Sungei Laiang, and their marriage fee is but 50 rupiah instead of the statutory 90 of the baroh branch.\n\nThe tribes then form close corporations, the members of which are bound together by a common interest. Hence the sayings compare the tribesfolk to a bunch of sireh leaves\u2014a cluster of coconuts and a mess of curried meat.\n\n(1) vide Saying XV. app. I. (2) vide Saying XXX. app. I.\n(3) Each tribe is a separate corporation: should the tribe have distinct baroh and darat settlements then it would form not one, but two corporations.\n(4) vide Saying XXXIII. app. I.\nThese corporations may accept additions to their numbers, but with the sole end of thereby enhancing the value of tribal property. All customary rules relating to the sale or mortgage of property, or to division of property on divorce or death, tend to conserve the property in the tribes. Death is regarded by the custom as a diminution of tribal wealth. Hence, in the case of murder an equivalent return was exacted from the murderer's tribe: not the death of the murderer but the transfer of the slayer's blood relation to the tribe of the slain.\\(^1\\) The murderer cannot make restitution in person\u2014his tribe must make good the damage inflicted. Hence his son\u2014who cannot be a member of his father's tribe\u2014is exempt, and his nephew\\(^2\\) suffers vicariously.\n\nAdoption of a child is subject to the consent not only of the maternal relations waris of the adopted, but to the permission of his l\u00ebmbaga and involves complete severance from the tribe of the child's birth.\\(^3\\)\n\nEvery marriage, under the exogamic custom, brings a new male adherent to the tribe, for the married man belongs to the place of his marriage.\\(^4\\) Marriage is regarded not solely as a contract between individuals but rather is a circumstance fraught with gain or loss to the tribe. Were the individuals taken as the unit, not her chief, nor her uncles and cousins, but the lady herself, who has fallen victim to a sabine marriage, would profit by the penalties custom exacts from her mother-in-law.\\(^5\\)\n\nThis strict conservation of tribal possessions is based on the fiction by which all real property is held to have been acquired in the eleven immigrant tribes by purchase. In other states of the Negri Sembilan Federation the Batin\u2014or\n\n---\n\n(1) vide Sayings XXXIV and XXXV. app. I.\n(2) A member of the waris tribe is ineligible for adoption, however, into any other tribe.\n(3) vide Saying XXXIX. app. I.\n(4) v.

The method of that fictitious conveyance is described in Saying XXIII. But in Rembau the proprietary right of the aborigines in the soil vested in the waris by virtue of the alliance contracted between To\u2019 Lela Balang and the daughter of Batin Sakudai.\\(^1\\) The Batin were relegated to the depths of the forest\\(^2\\) and the immigrant tribes redeemed the land they occupied from waris.\n\nThe precedence of the \u201csuku waris\u201d over the eleven purely immigrant Tribes rests on their claim to proprietorship of the soil.\\(^3\\) \u201cFrom the trickle at the stream\u2019s source to the breaking waves at the mouth belongs to the waris, but the plots of the riceswamp and the rows of the betel palms are the lembagas\u2019.\u201d\\(^4\\)\n\nThe recognised settlements of the Tribes are technically known as tanah T\u00ebbusan\u2014redeemed lands. The waris proprietary right therein has been bought out by the cultivator during his occupancy. This category includes the mass of alienated land in Rembau. The products of these redeemed lands\u2014represented the tribal wealth, and in 1892 A.D., the assessment levied thereon, was taken as the basis for calculation of the lembagas\u2019 dues; but under Malay rule redeemed land was subject to no tax or title.\n\nLand other than redeemed land is known as tanah ta\u2019-b\u00ebrt\u00ebbus or tanah waris. Such land was not necessarily unoccupied, but occupants, even of the waris tribe, held no alienable or transmissible interest therein. On these lands certain dues were payable, not to the lembaga of the B\u00ebduanda waris tribe, for then the land would rank as a tribal holding\u2014but to the undang and waris as a whole.

The curious will note that two items in the inheritance of the waris as stated in Saying XVII\u2014ivory and bezoar stones\u2014are identical with the offerings made by the timid sons of To\u2019 Raja di Gunong to Prince Jahia on his journey to the Tanah Hulu.\\(^2\\)\n\nThe waris tribe is constituted of eight settlements (kampong)\u2014four in each of the two families, Jakun and Jawa. Each kampong is ruled by an elder (ibu bapa) and the elders elect the To\u2019 Perba\u2014lembaga of the tribe.\n\nThe single Darat settlement at Chuai (Kampong Tebat) follows as lembaga the Dato\u2019 S\u00ebtia Maharaja\u2014hence the waris Tebat are ineligible for election to the office of the Perba. Further, in spite of the tenure of the office by To\u2019 Kosil\u2014a waris Tebat\u2014it is generally recognised that a flaw (chachat)\\(^3\\) in their pedigree has disqualified the waris Tebat from receiving the major waris inheritance\u2014the Undangship\u2014(p\u00ebsaka undang).\n\nThe unique character of the waris Tribe finds constitutional expression in the existence of the waris Gedang (chief waris) and the Orang Besar Undang (nobles of the Law giver)\u2014offices to which no other tribes present a parallel.\n\nThe waris Gedang include besides the Dato\u2019 Perba\u2014the tribal chief\u2014the Dato\u2019 Menetri Lela Perkasa, the Dato\u2019 Mangku Bumi, the Dato\u2019 Shahbandar, and the Dato\u2019 Raja Diraja. The four latter chiefs form the Council of the Orang Besar Undang.\n\n\\(^{(1)}\\) Emping sakempit, bras sagantang.\n\n\\(^{(2)}\\) vide chap. 2 I, p. 2, cf. also J.R.A.S., vol.

Soc., No. 56, 1910.\nThe rank of *waris Gedang* burdens its holder with no definite duties while the privileges it confers are mainly pecuniary. \"Great with great (gedang), and small with small\" is the customary rule: the greater the rank the larger the share in the *waris* pickings. At the present day these four chiefs each draw a share of the revenue derived from Rembau other than court and registration collections.\n\nClaim to a share of revenue could only be justified in the case of a head of the *waris* (*k\u0113pala waris*). To this rank only the *Dato' Perba* and the *Dato' Shahbandar* have any valid pretensions.\n\nThe history of the 4 offices establishes this contention. The office of Dato' Shahbandar is an ancient Johor creation, rotating through all the seven *Baroh* settlements of the *waris* tribe. Local antiquarians admit that two centuries ago the Shahbandar in Rembau enjoyed all the riparian privileges attached to the parallel office in Sungei Ujong\u2014where the division of the *waris* into the distinct branches of *waris didarat*, under the Dato' Klana, and the *waris di-ayer*\u2014under the Dato' Bandar\u2014has served to maintain the importance of the office. In so far however as the position of Shahbandar is open to all Rembau *waris* and carried with it at the date of creation (early in 18th century) prerogatives which the inland position of the state and the existence of a Yang di Per Tuan Muda combined to efface, so far the Shahbandar is justified in ranking as a \"*k\u0113pala waris*.\"\n\nThe Mangku-Bumi also dates back to the era of Johor suzerainty over Rembau. On the death of Lulinsoh the 9th Undang Rembau (1790 A.D.?) 3 claimants fought for the succession\u2014ultimately obtained by P\u0113kak, a *waris* of Kampong Tengah, and Pasah\u2014a *waris* of Kampong Tanjong\u2014one of the defeated candidates, appealed to Johor. The suzerain was unwilling\u2014as in his tottering dignity he was unable, to interfere, but solaced Pasah with a title (*gelaran*) To' Mangku-Bumi\u2014an\n\n(1) vide Saying quoted by Hervey, J R.A.S., vol. xiii, p. 248. Di sauk ayer: di jatah ranting sa champak galah di tepi tebing To' Bandar yang punia.\nheirloom in his family p\u0113rut of Tanjong waris.\\(^1\\) This family distinction can support no claim to precedence as a \"Head\" of the waris tribe.\n\nNot even a royal creation can be claimed for the Dato' M\u011bntri Lela P\u0113rkasa.\\(^2\\) Dato' Akhir's appointment as Undang in 1837-8 A.D., was challenged by one Kulub K\u0113chil, also a waris of Kampong Pulau. An appeal to arms bringing no decisive result, the good offices of the Dato' K\u0113lana of Sungai Ujong (K\u0113lana Kawal) were invoked. He decided that longevity should settle the dispute, and that, in the meantime, both claimants should rank as Undang. To keep peace between the two he appointed a waris of kampong Chengkau\u2014with the title of M\u011bntri Penghulu as go-between. This officer is the ancestor of the Dato' M\u011bntri Lela P\u0113rkasa. Within 3 years Kulub K\u0113chil died a natural death and the reason for the M\u011bntri's existence disappeared.\n\nThe office of To' Raja Diraja represents nothing more than the ennobling by Tungku Radin (Yam Tuan Besar, A.D., 1837) of a royal Kathi, who was also a waris of kampong Chengkau\u2014in an attempt at obtaining a supporter in Rembau for the claims of the Sri Menanti suzerain.\n\nIt must then be held that only the fortunate conjunction of an able holder of the offices with a crisis that could be turned to their private account has prevented the positions of To' M\u011bntri, To' Mangku, and To' Raja from being involved in the oblivion that has befallen the two M\u011bntris and the two Laksamanas mentioned as important Rembau chiefs in 1831 by Newbold;\\(^3\\) whose very titles, if the Suroh Raja be excepted, find no claimant in Rembau to-day.\n\n---\n\n\\(^{(1)}\\) Harvey op. cit. p. 259, states that the Mentri was created by Raja Radin\u2014a state ent for which no authority can be found.\n\n\\(^{(2)}\\) This account of the origin of the \"Mangku Bumi\" is not admitted by the waris Tanjong. They claim that the title was granted by the Raja of Siak to a waris Tanjong who on a visit to Siak presented the Raja with a fine piece of wood-carving, a legend that provides even less support for the Mangku's claim to rank as kepala waris than the story given in the text.\n\n\\(^{(3)}\\) vide Newbold op. cit. vol. II. pp. 124-125.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 56, 1910.\nThe real importance of the *waris gedang* lies in their rank forming a stepping stone to the position of Law giver (*Undang*).\n\nThe insistence of the *Perba* on his duties as *lembaga*, and the commutation of his share of revenue for a fixed allowance, has fostered a confusion between the *waris Gedang*, and the *Orang Besar Undang*. These four officers form a council designed to hold the balance between *Undang* and *lembaga*. In these latter days an observer is apt to forget that relations between law giver and *tribal* chiefs were normally strained, but the existence of the council of the four depends on that fact.\n\nThe duties of the Four are defined in Saying XXVIII. They are as a staff up the hill, a raft at sea, a torch on land, to aid the *Undang*. Their powers are limited to tendering advice on points submitted to them by the Law Giver. They have no Status whatever warranting interference between a *lembaga* and his people in questions of tribal government\u2014a vast field for activity on which the Four Chiefs are only too prone to encroach.\n\nLatterly, the presence of the Four at the deliberations of the Undang and Lembaga has been resented acutely by the tribal chiefs. Smarting under interference with their own privileges the lembaga have carried the war into the enemies' country. But though they hoist the banner of \"the constitution\" their action is probably dictated by an outraged sense of the fitness of things.\n\nThe offices of the Bandar and Perba rotate through all the *waris Kampongs*\u00b9 (b\u00ebrgilir), but Chengkau alone can provide a Dato' M\u00ebntri, or a Raja Diraja; and the Mangku Bumi must be a *waris* of Kampong Tengah. It is conceivable, then, that Chengkau *waris* might monopolise at one time four-fifths of all the revenues enjoyed by the *waris gedang*.\n\n\u00b9 Exclusive of the *waris Darat*, Kampong Tebat.\nChapter II.\n\nSection 2, The Tribal Officer (Orang Besar.)\n\nThe Orang Besar, or officers in the tribe are divided into two grades:\n\n(a) those who are officials of the Undang (pegawai pada Undang) and supports of the tribal chief (\"tongkat sokong pada lembaga\").\n\n(b) those who are merely minor officials of the 'Lembaga' (\"besar dalam anak buah.\")\\(^1\\)\n\nThe office of orang besar, generally known as \"besar,\" is a direct creation, in the case of grade (a), of the Undang acting on his own initiative or on representation of the lembaga and waris of a tribe; in the case of grade (b) of lembaga.\n\n'Besar' of the second grade hold their office for life or until dismissal\u2014but the office dies with them.\n\nThe 'Besar' who is an officer of the Undang (grade a) may hold an appointment created for and dying with him, or may be in enjoyment of an office forming part of the inheritance (pesaka) of the tribe\u2014if the undang have definitely so pronounced when sanctioning the creation (tanaman) of the title. The inherited office is never confined to one family (perut) but rotates (bergilir) through all the families comprised in the tribe.\n\nA special creation (tanaman) by the Undang which has lapsed at the death of the first recipient may however be renewed, by consent of the Undang, to some one definite applicant, on presentation of two offerings of rice and cakes (bokor) by the waris (relations on the mother's side) of the first holder.\n\nThe number of orang besar in any given tribe is hence uncertain and inconstant. The besar of grade (a) ranks\u2014as an officer of the Undang\u2014above the elder (ibu bapa) in the tribe, but the elder takes precedence of the lesser besar\u2014the officer of the lembaga.\n\n\\(^1\\) vide Appendix IV.\nThe primary duty of either class of 'b\u0113sar' is to act as a check upon the tribal official to whom he is immediately inferior.\n\nThe 'b\u0113sar' of the l\u0113mbaga's creation (grade b) brings to the notice of the l\u0113mbaga any instance of capricious or partisan action by the elder. The tribesfolk find in him a safeguard against attempted extortion (m\u0113ng\u0113ndap), or sheltering of an offender by the elder (m\u0113lindong).\n\nThe \"b\u0113sar\" is only too eager to listen to such complaints, for his share in the fine that may be exacted from a guilty elder forms his main source of income.\n\nThe \"b\u0113sar\" appointed by the Undang forms the constitutional check in the tribes on the l\u0113mbaga, in his dealings with the elders. His rank as officer of the Undang (p\u0113gawai pada Undang) entitles him to an audience in the balai, where he may present the elder's case against the tribal chief. The l\u0113mbaga cannot retaliate on him for his dismissal from office lies with the Undang alone.\n\nAs official of the court of the Undang, this b\u0113sar carried out the procedure laid down by custom for execution of a decree in favour of a beduanda creditor, against real property of an immigrant tribesman (rejab, lengkong), on an order which could issue only from the Undang. He cut the posts marking out the boundary, dug the ground, planted the tufted spear in the court yard, and took possession of the land in the name of the Undang.\n\nFor either duty he received payment from the Undang\u2014a share of the fine, or a prime cut from the buffalo sacrificed in settlement (daging p\u0113tabah dua jari). As an officer of the Undang he was also entitled to an alms of 12 cents at the burial ceremonies of the Undang.\n\nThe official appointed by the Undang to represent him in a tribe transferred from the government of the tribal chief (ter-gantong pada Undang)\u00b2 was drawn from the b\u0113sar p\u0113gawai\n\n(1) rejab, lengkong, chapter II \u00a7 5 sub Undang.\n(2) v. chap. II, \u00a7 1 sub suku.\nundang. He was however incapable of performing, without specific authorisation, any of the duties belonging by custom to the l\u0113mbaga. His work as overseer of the tribe was confined to laying the needs and complaints of his people before the Undang, seldom with any effect. He could claim no share in the l\u0113mbaga\u2019s dues which the Undang pocketed, but he was liable to fine for every affray, or breach of the peace, in the tribe under his charge.\n\n\u201cBesar\u201d of either grade have also duties as officers of the l\u0113mbaga\u2019s court. No form of irregular marriage except that of m\u0113ny\u0113rah can be settled by an elder. Performance of the ceremonial and payment of the penalty due in settlement of other marriage irregularities are supervised on behalf of the tribal chief, by the \u201cbesar,\u201d who obtains 12 cents of the l\u0113mbaga\u2019s fee as his share.\n\nThe office of \u201cbesar,\u201d while far from onerous, was under Malay rule a fearful and precarious possession. The birth of an illegitimate child in his tribe brought the \u201cbesar\u201d a fine of 1 bahara from the Undang. He could never escape from his official position. If he was found innocently gossiping beneath a friend\u2019s verandah\u2014he was liable to fine and dismissal. Were he caught in a girl\u2019s house (terkurong) he could not save the situation merely by marriage\u2014as any peasant might do\u2014but was also fined and dismissed from office. He was even debarred from shouldering his coop of fowls (m\u0113ngandar) and earning an honest dollar or two as a hawker.

Hence the larger tribes number several Elders\u2014the smaller, one only.\\(^2\\) The Suku B\u0113duanda (\\(waris\\) tribe) provides the purest model of tribal government. In that tribe each of the original eight settlements (\\(kampongs\\)) is under the direct rule of an Elder (\\(ibu bapa\\)).\n\nThe elder is elected by the suffrages of the members of the family or families under his charge and their choice is subject to the approval of the tribal chief (\\(l\u0113mbaga\\)).\n\nAs the literal translation of his title (\\(ibu bapa=\\)the mother-father) indicates, the scope of the Elder\u2019s duties is found in the lowlier matters of everyday life in his family (\\(p\u0113rut\\)). The sayings liken his position to the chestnut tree on the plain, sprouting from the base of the trunk:\\(^4\\) or to the crow hovering as it alights.\\(^5\\) All feasts of marriage, of circumcision, of incision, or of boring of the ears, where a goat is slain, demand his presence, as recorder.\\(^6\\) The marriage fee (\\(mas kahwin\\)) is paid through him, the bridegroom\u2019s private property (\\(h\u0113rta t\u0113rbawa\\)) must be declared in his presence, he makes the division of acquired property (\\(p\u0113ncharian\\)) at divorce. Satisfaction of a debt is duly attested only by payment before the Elder. He is the qualified witness for his section of the tribe.\n\n---\n\n\\(^{(1)}\\) vide Saying No. I\n\n\\(^{(2)}\\) vide Appendix IV.\n\n\\(^{(3)}\\) vide Saying No. XXVI.\n\n\\(^{(4)}\\) vide Saying No. III.\n\n\\(^{(5)}\\) vide Saying No. XXII.\n\n\\(^{(6)}\\) vide Saying No. XXIX.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nBut the key to the denotation of his duties as well as of his rights is found in rule that \"the Elder is limited by his 'adat,' which 'adat' consists in a single goat.\" Whatever rite can be duly performed, whatever offence duly condoned, whatever dispute finally settled by the slaying of a goat, or by the payment of an equivalent sum, these fall within the province of the Elder.\n\nThe converse holds good at either extreme. Greater offences and grander ceremonies demand the cognisance or imprimatur of the tribal chief (lembaga); but if the elder's intervention is sought, his \"adat\" must be paid, even should the matter be proved to be beneath his jurisdiction, and terminable by the killing of a fowl, an animal anyone may slaughter with impunity. Rembau custom does not contemplate the gratuitous performance of official duties.\n\nIrregular marriages into their tribe provide tribal officials with a rich source of fees. When the lembaga's sanction is necessary to validate a marriage, he divides the fee payable to him with the Elder and the tribal officers. The \"surrender marriage\" (menyerah), where the man has enforced his suit by invasion of the verandah of the woman's house, may be sanctioned by an Elder, without reference to the tribal chief. The Elder is entitled thereat to a fee known as the \"betel-flower\" (Bunga Pinang), payable before the wedding ceremony takes place. In this fee the lembaga has no share, but two-thirds are divided by the Elder amongst the officers-in-the-tribe, and the male relatives of the bride. At the present day, when British intervention has whittled down to the last strand the duties of the Elder, he finds in a \"surrender marriage\" his best opportunity for obtruding his official position on the public; and hence his adat is apt to be spoken of as confined to the Bunga Pinang:\u2014an error which confuses the right with the occasion of its exercise.\n\n(1) vide Saying No. XXIX.\n(2) vide chapter IV. p. sub irregular marriages, for amount of this fee.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 56, 1910.\nBut prior to British Protection, the Elder possessed certain judicial powers. In his criminal jurisdiction he took cognisance of all breaches of the peace involving a wound, a scream, and blood from broken skin: but only when the wound had been inflicted on a part of the body covered by the wearing apparel. Cases of permanent disfigurement stood outside his jurisdiction.\n\nCivil Procedure under Rembau custom recognises four degrees, in the presumption of fact\u2014corresponding roughly to conclusive proof; probability; possibility; and absence of proof (\"sah:\" \"ta'sah:\" \"terang-gelap:\" \"gelap sa-mata.\")\n\nThe Elder\u2019s jurisdiction in contentious civil suits was very limited. He could investigate only cases where prima facie probability of debt existed\u2014when it was possible to get close to, to get at grips with the truth (ikat dengan ch\u0113kak) a matter of no little difficulty in dealing with people whose genius for perjury is proverbial (pusing anak Rembau).\n\nIf judgment was not followed by satisfaction of the debt, the elder had no power to enforce his decision. He reported to his tribal chief (lembaga) who proceeded to enforce execution. But the recalcitrant debtor committed contempt of the Elder by his refusal to pay, and became liable to a maximum fine of six rupia ($5 \\times 36c = $1.80.) Theoretically the elder could fine up to 10 rupia equal to $3.60, but in practice he never inflicted a heavier penalty than 3 rupia.\n\nA like penalty awaited the tribesman who refused to bring any question lying within an Elder\u2019s jurisdiction to his cognisance\u2014but dealt directly with the tribal chief. He was guilty of \u201cstepping over\u201d the elder (melangkah ibu bapa), and found that he could not ignore his petty chief with impunity.\n\n(1) Luka, chonget, pechah berdarah.\n(2) Luka ditutup kain, baju.\n(3) One of a list of epigrammatic descriptions of the outstanding characteristics of Malays in various parts of the Peninsula. e.g. Kecheh anak Malacca, wheelers are the men of Malacca: Sombong anak Pahang, Proud are the men of Pahang.\n(4) Sah utang iku dengan baianan.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nBut the office of Elder has a reverse side\u2014its relation to the tribal chief (l\u0113mbaga).\n\nThe official life or death of the Elder, says the custom, are in the hands of the l\u0113mbaga (Ibu bapa hidup mati kapada l\u0113mbaga).\u00b9\n\nThe tribal chief cannot appoint an Elder directly, but the selection of the tribe is contingent on his approval: and he has a free hand in the dismissal of his Elders.\n\n\"If an elephant die,\" so the saying runs, \"his tusks remain, if a tiger his stripes, if a serpent his markings, if a man his doings.\"\u00b2 Of all the doings of his \"children\" an Elder must be fully aware. He must be able to supply the tribal chief with a detailed history of every dispute or quarrel brought to the l\u0113mbaga for settlement. His ignorance of the \"doings\" is attributed either to neglect of duty, or to the sheltering of an offender and warrants the dismissal of the Elder from office.\n\nYet the Elder incurs an equal risk of deposition should he attempt to settle any question falling outside the narrow field of his powers. For there too he is sheltering (m\u0113lindong) some offender from a greater penalty than he, as Elder, can inflict, and playing the traitor (m\u0113nd\u0113rhaka) to his l\u0113mbaga. The least dereliction of his own duties or the smallest trespass on another's are grave offences for the Ibu Bapa.\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 v.

Soc., No. 56, 1910.\nChapter II.\n\nSection 4, Lembaga (The Tribal Chief.)\n\nThe lembaga is the supreme chief in each tribe. His place in the constitution is compared by the sayings to the sugar-palm on the slopes sprouting from its trunk\\(^1\\) beneath the coconut on the hill typifying the Undang, but above the chestnut of the elder on the plain. Each tribe is subject to one chief whose authority is coextensive with the settlements of that tribe. Two exceptions traverse this axiom.\n\nThe inheritance of the lembaga\u2014says the adat\u2014is stopped,\\(^2\\) (bers\u0113kat)\u2014stopped by the boundary between the inland and low country districts. Paya Kumboh tribesmen of the latter immigration who settled up country in the Sungai Laiang valley, follow the Dato' Sri Maharaja, and owe no allegiance to the Dato' Merbangsa, chief of the original Paya Kumboh settlers in the low-country swamps of L\u0113gong and Gadong. No Darat chief would deny ceremonial precedence to the lembaga of his tribe in the low country; but the admission opens no chink to his colleague for interference in purely tribal matters across the border.\n\nAgain, the whole or any portion of a tribe may pass under the direct protection of the Undang, who himself performs the duties of the lembaga. That tribe is then said to be dependent on the Undang (t\u0113rgantong kapada undang).\n\nIn theory transference to the Undang was a privilege to the tribespeople and a penalty to the lembaga, in practice always a penalty to both. The transfer must be preceded by a petition from the tribe, stating the grounds of dispute between them and the lembaga. The first move could not be made by the Undang. In this aspect the institution is not without parallel in other states. Not many years ago in Pahang if a man fell out with his territorial chief, he slipped down stream and on reaching Pekan borrowed a dollar from\n\n\\(^{(1)}\\) vide Saying III. App I.\n\n\\(^{(2)}\\) vide Saying XI. App. I.\nthe Bendahara and so passed into the direct service of the Raja with whose men no lesser chief dared interfere. The Rembau institution is peculiar in its application not to individuals but to tribes; but in its effect, as increasing the power of the head of the state at the expense of the chiefs, is identical with the Pahang custom. Originally intended as a temporary measure to prevent disturbance during the settlement of a dispute between a lembaga and his tribesfolk, the status of dependence on the Undang became crystallized into a form of tribal Government.\n\nThe Anak Aceh tribe provides the classical example. From earliest time only the Pulau family was eligible for the office of Dato\u2019 Lela Wangsa\u2014lembaga of the Anak Aceh tribe. But the growing importance of the Anak Aceh settlements at Bongek and Bintongan induced To\u2019 Lela Wangsa Maalam, in 1877, to offer an extension of full rights to these branches of the tribe. The offer was accepted. On the day appointed for the ceremonial feast Bongek and Bintongan killed their buffalo, boiled their rice, baked their sweet-meats, received the Undang (Haji Sabil) with full ceremony on his arrival, and waited for Maalam and the Pulau contingent\u2014in vain. At the last moment the Pulau men had changed their minds. Incensed at such cavalier treatment, Bongek and Bintongan refused to follow Maalam longer, and placed themselves under the protection of the Undang.\n\nThe sequel is instructive. In 1896 when the Undang (Dato\u2019 Serun) had proved for eight years his indifference to the lesser duties of a lembaga, when transfers of land were prevented by his refusing to \u201cbeat the bounds,\u201d when advances towards reconciliation had only brought down fines on the peacemakers, the dependent Anak Aceh forwarded their petition to the British Resident praying for permission to follow their own lembaga again\u2014or if that might not be granted, to follow any other lembaga whomsoever, and so escape from the \u201cprotection\u201d of the Undang.\n\n(1) v. chap. II. section 4.\nThe l\u0113mbaga of a dependent tribe was penalised by losing his dues from the tribesfolk who passed out of his control; but neither in the Anak Acheh case, nor in the S\u0113ri L\u0113mak tribe, where a portion left the Dato\u2019 Sinda Maharaja for his failure to exact the return (balas) for the murder of a S\u0113ri M\u0113lenggang man living in the Sinda\u2019s sphere of influence\u2014did the penalty move the l\u0113mbaga to repentance with works.\n\nThe Undang alone benefitted by the transfer. Only by his consent could his protection, once accorded, be removed; and when he did agree to release the dependent tribe, customs gave him a dismissal fee of one \u201cbahara\u201d ($14.00).\n\nAs shown in the table in appendix III, the l\u0113mbaga fall into two main groups;\n\n(a) The l\u0113mbaga yang delapan\u2014\u201cthe Eight;\u201d\n(b) The l\u0113mbaga yang dua b\u0113las\u2014the Twelve.\n\nThe l\u0113mbaga yang delapan\u2014known as Tiang Balai (pillars of the Undang\u2019s hall of audience) or Tulang Urat (the bones and sinew)\u2014form a council without reference to which the Undang is powerless to take action. He can hold no enquiry into alleged breaches of custom except in the presence of \u201cthe Eight,\u201d sitting as assessors, and no treaty he signs is binding on the state if it lacks the counter signatures of \u201cthe Eight.\u201d\n\nThe council of \u201cthe Eight\u201d formed by the addition of the four major Darat chiefs to the old council of \u201cthe Four,\u201d dates from the year 1831 A.D. Prior to that date the darat and baroh lembaga met on no common ground. The low country, constituted as the two leagues of the four and five tribes, in virtue of comprising not only all the elder immigrant settlements, but seven of the eight waris kampongs, whence alone the Undang could be chosen, ranks as the senior district. The activities of the darat chiefs were confined, at that date, to tribal matters and the external policy of the state was determined by the Undang and the council of the four baroh lembaga. Sufficient evidence of this old constitution is found in\n\n(1) v. chap. I. p. 6 and chap. II. sec. 1.\nthe text of the Dutch treaties of 1760 and 1819 A.D. and the British treaty of 1833 A.D. But the precedence of the baroh division has also left its traces in the heavier marriage fees payable in certain of the baroh tribes,\\(^1\\) in the comparatively petty function of the four great Darat chiefs at the election of the Undang,\\(^2\\) and in the richer ceremonial prescribed at the burial of one of \u201cthe Four\u201d in the low country.\\(^3\\)\n\nNeither the council of \u201cthe Four,\u201d nor the later institution of \u201cthe Eight,\u201d possessed, as such, any right of interference with the members of the second group of chiefs\u2014\u201cthe Twelve.\u201d\n\nOnly nine chiefs are now recognised as forming the group known as \u201cThe Twelve,\u201d and it has been held that the title\u2014\u201cThe Twelve\u201d\u2014refers not to the chiefs but to the tribes. This theory is open to several objections. The group of \u201cthe Twelve\u201d is admittedly a separate classification to \u201cthe Eight\u201d: it does not include all the twelve tribes: the S\u00ebri L\u00ebmak, Paya Kumboh and Tiga Nenek tribes provide chiefs for the group of \u201cthe Eight\u201d only; again the contrast between \u201cthe Eight\u201d and \u201cthe Twelve\u201d is unexplained by this theory for each of \u201cthe Eight\u201d is, equally with each of \u201cthe Twelve,\u201d chief\u2014of someone of the twelve tribes forming the Rembau confederation. There is little doubt that the title refers to the number of chiefs as the group.\n\nPrior to the Rawa invasion of Rembau at the end of the 18th century this group included also the Dato\u2019 Mengkota, head of the S\u00ebri M\u00eblenggang tribal settlement at Kendong and the Dato\u2019 Dagang, a chief of the S\u00ebri M\u00eblenggang M\u00ebnangkabau trio\u00eb. These two chiefs aided the invader and were punished by exclusion from the group of \u201cthe Twelve.\u201d\\(^4\\) The twelfth member of the group was To\u2019 Lela Raja\u2014chief of the Tiga Batu tribe sa\u2019b\u00eblah baroh. By settling in the L\u00ebgong valley the Tiga Batu immigrants owed allegiance to the Dato\u2019\n\n---\n\n(1) vide Appendix IV.\n(2) chap II. sec. 6 sub undang.\n(3) At the funeral of a Darat chief no money is scattered on the road to the tomb, and no white cloth is spread on the path as at the funeral of one of the 4 sablah baroh.\n(4) vide ante chap. I.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 56, 1910.\nBangsa Balang, to whom their chief became subordinate, though admitted into the group of \"the Twelve.\" The circumstances of his exclusion from that group are a matter of dispute. The five baroh members of the group possessed equal power with \"the Eight,\" in their respective tribes, and, within their limited spheres of influence, the S\u00e9tia Maharaja and the Sutan Bendahara are paramount\u2014their judicial powers were the same, and the fees due them for the performance of their functions are identical with the customary emoluments of \"the Eight.\" The Maharaja Inda and the Ngiang, however are bound to act in concert with the Mend\u00e9lika, and are constitutionally incapable of independent action except in questions affecting their own tribe alone.\n\n\"The Twelve\" are technically known as the Kepak Sayap (the wings and pinions). From them the Undang selects chiefs to attend him on his official journeys. They have the right to be present at a sitting of the Undang and \"the Eight\" lembaga, but their absence does not invalidate the session, and they have no voice in the election of the Undang.\n\nOn the death of a lembaga custom prescribes that his successor should be chosen before the burial ceremonies are completed. Considerable importance attaches to the due performance of these rites. If the custom is not \"maintained erect\" (adat ta'berdiri) the family to which the deceased lembaga belonged, loses the franchise (p\u00ebsaka). A violent death (mati t\u00e8rk\u00e8jut) or death from infectious disease is held to warrant the omission of these ceremonies.\n\nSelection of a successor lies with the elders of the tribe acting in accordance with the wishes of the minor headmen (b\u00ebsar) and fully enfranchised members (warus) of the tribe. The field for selection is narrowed by a strict rule of rotation among the several fully enfranchised families (p\u00ebrut) of the tribe. Their nomination may be rejected by the Undang at will, and is valid only when confirmed by his acceptance of homage from the new chief.\n\n(1) vide case of To' Raja S\u00ebnara chief of Tanah Datar buwoh tribe. For ceremony prescribed at death of lembaga see appendix VI.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nIn practice, then, the election of a l\u00ebmbaga depends on the Undang; with the Undang too lies the dismissal of the l\u00ebmbaga from office. As the saying states, the l\u00ebmbaga's existence lies on the knees of the Undang (hidup mati kapada Undang). But the Undang may not follow his caprice in exercising his power of dismissal. He is not only bound, in considering an alleged offence, to summon \"the Eight,\" whose sympathies necessarily lie with their fellow-chief, but he must show cause for holding that the l\u00ebmbaga has been guilty of an offence for which custom prescribes dismissal as the penalty.\n\nThese offences fall into two classes (1) offences against the tribe\u2014involving dereliction of duty. (2) Offences against the Undang, involving trespass on the prerogative of the Undang.\n\nThe first class contains four items: harbouring and false accusation; causing wrongful loss and permitting wrongful gain; infliction of a disgrace on the tribe; detection in unlawful intercourse.\n\nThe second class comprises the six pantang Undang. Offences of this class bear two aspects, first as tabooed acts; then as offences against the custom (adat). Treason (m\u00ebnderhaka) in its secondary aspect, is the crime of acting against the proper function of the offender\u2014the l\u00ebmbaga\u2014in open opposition to the Undang. This was the crime of To' Bangsa Balang, Haji Abdul-Karim, when in 1871 A.D. he supported Haji Mustapa in his fight with Haji Sahil for the Undangship. Conviction of a tabooed act involved, under Malay rule, not only dismissal from office but confiscation of all property. Saying No. XXI states at length the ceremonies; whereat a l\u00ebmbaga's attendance is required: weddings and marriages; feasts and festivals (such as the Hari Raya feasts); incision and boring of the ears: circumcision and confirmation; on a formal summons; on a present of rice borne of two in the daytime; on a present of cakes borne of four at night.\n\n(1) v.

A. Soc., No. 56, 1910.\nChapter II.\n\nSection 5, Undang (The Lawgiver).\n\nSayings Nos. X and XI define the scope of the Undang's power. He is the supreme authority in the State\u2014as distinguished on the one side from the Tribe and the other from the Confederation of States. Incapable of direct interference between a l\u00ebmbaga and his tribe, he is not subject to the dictates of the Raja in the domestic affairs of his State. But though supreme, his power, as lacking natural sanction, is in practice far from autocratic. If free from the slavery of the l\u00ebmbaga to precedent\u2014his hands are tied not only by the gyves of custom (adat), but also by his council of Eight chiefs\u2014and, in a much lesser degree, by the deference due to his special advisers, the four orang b\u00ebsar undang.\n\nHis election is governed by a strict custom. The Undang is chosen in alternation from the two families of Jakun and Jawa. This rule is alluded to in the saying which describes the Undang as the coconut growing on the hill sprouting from its double eye. The history of Rembau tells of no exception to this rule, known as the gilirian Perut (or giliran b\u00ebsar) the rotation of families, except possibly during one period of Rembau History. The field of eligible candidates is further restricted, in theory, by the rule known as the giliran kampong\u2014or rotation of settlements. A Jakun waris must belong to one of the four Jakun settlements of Kota, Ch\u00ebngkau, Gadong or T\u00ebbat\u2014and the Jawa family is similarly divided into the four settlements of Bukit, Pulau, Tanjong and T\u00ebngah. The rotation of settlements was designed to produce an even distribution of privileges in either family by securing the election of the Undang from each settlement in its turn. Kampong Bukit cannot provide a second Undang till Pulau.\n\n(1) v. Saying XXX App. I.\n(2) v. chap I. p. 4.\n(3) v. Saying III App. I.\nTengah and Tanjong have each in their turn set a S\u00ebdia Raja in office. It would, however, be idle to assert that this democratic principle has been honoured except in the breach. T\u00ebbat, Gadong, Pulau and Tanjong are offshoots of the four earliest settlements, and the very division of the families into eight recognised \"Kampongs\" dates only from the \"Undangship\" of To' Bogok (date A. D. 1810\u20141819.) A glance at the table of the Rembau Undang will show that a Chengkau waris has eight times held the supreme office, while Kota, the earliest settlement of all, has provided the first Dato' Rembau, and no other. In practice the giliran b\u00ebsar only is operative.\n\nIn theory the new Undang should be chosen before his predecessor's grave is closed: but the practical difficulty of settling promptly rival claims has rendered this rule a dead letter.\n\nThe selection of a successor to a deceased Undang lies with the four great chiefs of the low country\u2014\"baroh.\" When the rule of the \"giliran b\u00ebsar\" confines selection to the waris Jakun, the Dato' Gempa Maharaja has the right\u2014as has the To' Merbangsa, in the alternative event, of nominating a candidate. This nomination is preceded by the suggestion of possible successors by the five waris gedang, who have however, as potential candidates themselves\u2014no right of nomination. Should the nominee prove acceptable to the four chiefs, they are said to be in accord (k\u00ebbulatan) and the four inland chiefs are desired to express their consent. (\"Yang sa-b\u00eblah baroh m\u00ebnjadikan, yang sa-b\u00eblah darat m\u00ebrukui\"). It is essential that the eight chiefs be agreed on one candidate, for only an unanimous selection is valid. Dissent by the waris gedang or the twelve lesser tribal chiefs is immaterial\u2014provided that the candidate fulfils all requirements of blood and family. Inability to discover a candidate acceptable to all the electors resulted, under Malay rule, in war, but, by the provisions of the British treaty of A. D. 1883,\n\n(1) v. Appendix II.\n(2) v. chap. II. \u00a7 1 sub Suku.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 56, 1910.\nreference is now made in the event of disagreement, to H. E. the Governor of the Straits Settlements, whose decision is final.\n\nWhen the elector-chiefs are agreed, the name of the new Undang is pronounced by the senior lembara and all chiefs render homage. A date is then fixed for installation (menabal or melantek) to ensure the presence of the eight great tribal chiefs, the \"tiang balai,\" or pillars of the audience hall. The prospective Undang is taken to his mother's house where he remains until the day of the ceremony. Ancient custom provided that the ceremony of installation should be performed at Kampong Nerasau but there is ample precedent for choosing the house of the Undang, wherever situate, as a more convenient spot.\n\nWhen all chiefs are assembled, the Undang takes his seat on the canopied dais erected in the hall of audience (balai) which is hung with the insignia of his office.\u00b9 The chiefs then, in order of precedence, advance (menyalang) and render homage (menyembah). The absence of a tribal chief, if duly informed of the day fixed for the installation, except for a valid reason to be previously notified, is held to imply refusal to acknowledge the Undang, and involves his deposition and the immediate choice of a successor to replace him at the ceremony.\u00b2 If illness prevents his attendance, a chief may appoint a member of his tribe to represent him, as pangku (officiating) and to pay homage in his place. When all present have rendered obeisance the ceremony is concluded with prayer.\n\nTwo distinct r\u00f4les are combined in the office of Undang\u2014first, headship of the waris of Rembau; second, headship of the State. The combination of the two gives its peculiar nature to the power wielded by the Undang, as compared with the authority of other officers under the Rembau constitution. A detailed consideration of the unique attributes attaching to the office of Undang as stated in saying X, affords clear\n\n\u00b9 v. Saying XII for a list of these insignia.\n\u00b2 In 1905 7 chiefs were deposed for wilful absence from the installation of the Dato' Lela Maharaja Haji Sulong.\nproof of the twofold nature of his authority. The humblest peasant in a tribe differs in degree only of tribal right from his chief. But the Undang is Bert\u00ebromba (vide saying X). He adds to his constitutional authority, the privilege of blood\u2014of a pedigree traced on the maternal side, back to the aborigines, the heirs of the soil he rules, whose rights have been merged in his. The l\u00ebmbaga\u2019s inheritance may run through as long a line of matrons but it ultimately rests on purchase. The fusion of the Batin with the waris rights is peculiar to Rembau. The inheritance of the Johol and Sungai Ujong rulers is not Bert\u00ebromba. Their power is still, nominally, delegated by the Batin and the consent of the nine Batin chiefs is still requisite to the appointment of the Dato\u2019 Johol.\n\nTo employ technical terms, the Undang\u2019s power in Johol is bersilsilah, not bert\u00ebromba. The B\u00ebduanda, as a tribe, owe allegiance to their tribal chief\u2014the Dato\u2019 Perba\u2014and as a member of the waris tribe the Undang would acknowledge himself a child (anak buah) of the Perba; but in their capacity of (waris negri) heirs to the soil\u2014as distinct from their position as members of a tribal corporation, the Jakun and Jawa families look to the Undang as their representative and sovereign. As chief Waris the Undang drew a tribute from all unredeemed lands of a packet of parched rice, and a measure of husked rice\u2014he received a duty on minerals and agricultural produce exported from Rembau by miners and foreign planters, and from this revenue he personally paid the Elders in the unredeemed lands, who to this day draw their yearly pittance from him and not from the Waris tribal chief. A l\u00ebmbaga rules his tribe, but can act only for the benefit of the tribe he rules. To extract personal advantage, from his position, would be to make merchandise of his people (berniaga dalam anak buah), an offence punishable with deposition.\n\nHis headship of the waris negeri, resting on claims of blood, procures for the Undang a prerogative distinct from, but\n\n(1) v. chap. II \u00a7 1 sub Suku.\n(2) cf. Saying VI.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 56, 1910.\nenhancing his power as constitutional head of the federation of tribes. The high marriage fees payable to a beduanda bride,\\(^1\\) the peculiar penalty exacted for the murder of a Waris,\\(^2\\) and the impossibility of a Waris passing by adoption into another tribe,\\(^3\\) prove that the Waris was, as such, invested with some degree of personal sanctity. The constitutional authority of the Undang was thus hedged around with sentiment.\n\nThe alleged assumption, then, by the Undang, on the expulsion of the Raja from Rembau in 1836, A.D. of prerogatives elsewhere claimed as peculiar to the Raja\u2014such as the power of fining up to 66 kupang, and the rights over illegitimate children, was warranted, if not by his position as constitutional head of the federation of tribes, then by his rights as the supreme waris negeri. His birth gave him the right to \"resheathe the drawn dagger.\"\\(^4\\) Whether or not individual holders of the office found themselves able to exercise that right in every instance is a question that does not affect constitutional theory. The expulsion of the Raja was even less consistent with his theoretical eminence.\n\nThe Undang's power is secondly distinguished from that of the Lemba\\(^5\\) as \"berkhalifah.\" In his own State he is the vicegerent of God\u2014head of the church as well as of the state. Till quite recent years (1889) the office of Kathi did not exist in Rembau; and the civil powers now delegated to the Kathi were exercised by the Undang. But the quality \"berkhalifah\" is also construed secularly. The lembaga is the slave of precedent\\(^5\\) but custom does not lie so heavily on the Undang. It is not so stiff as to make innovation impossible for him. His orders, issued in the audience hall\\(^6\\) are it is true strictly limited by a crystalized custom, the views of the council of\n\n\\(^{(1)}\\) v. Appendix IV. \\(^{(2)}\\) v. chap.

The Undang then creates precedent. Even should the offence be clearly classified, or the breach of custom proved wilful, the penalty sanctioned by custom may be varied by the Undang. The notched blade may be refashioned, says the adat, the broken blade re-welded.\\(^2\\) But clemency is a prerogative of the Undang alone. A Lembaga has no power whatever to remit or vary any customary penalty when once he has held formal enquiry into an alleged offence, and stated his finding.\n\nThe reason for exclusion of the offences classified as \"Pantang Undang\" from the cognisance of the lembaga throws further light on the nature of the Undang's authority. These crimes classified in dual terms,\\(^3\\) agreeably to the usage of traditional sayings, differ in kind from the common \"offence.\" Their double aspect as forbidden acts, and as breaches of custom has already been remarked.\n\nThey were regarded not as crimes against individuals, nor as acts diminishing the wealth of a tribal corporation, but as outrages on the function either of their perpetrator or of the subject of the crime, in society as constituted under a tribal system of Government. The lembaga who is merely the protector of tribal interests is unqualified to try such a case: and the fact, that such offences are Pantang Undang, and not primarily cognisable by the Raja, even during his nominal suzerainty over the state, strongly supports the view here taken of the dual significance of \"berkhalifah\" as an attribute of the Undang's authority.\n\n\\(^{(1)}\\) vide chap.

XXIII. p. 147 but no attempt is made at an explanation.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 56, 1910.\nThe Undang issues his orders (sabda) in his hall of audience (balai). He may not reconsider a decision once pronounced or revise a judgment once delivered; and only when the Eight lembaga are in audience, can he hear a case or issue his order.\n\nTheoretically the Undang can take cognisance of no matter unless brought to his notice by a lembaga. With the two exceptions of his own wife, and any unmarried mother, no one but a Lembaga or an officer of the Undang (Besar Undang) has the right of speaking in the audience hall, uninvited. But the lembaga is bound to bring before the Undang every matter transcending his \"buffalo\" jurisdiction.\u00b9\n\nHe is the policeman who binds the criminal.\u00b2 The original jurisdiction of the Undang embraces every offence for which death, or, in the case of a tribal official (orang beradat), deprivation of office is the penalty. The six Pantang Undang, the four offences enumerated in saying 38 and all cases of adultery were reserved for his court.\n\nHe sat also as an appeal court to enforce or vary decisions of a lembaga: but not without first referring to his council of eight tribal chiefs the question of the validity or justice of the lower court's order.\n\nHis power of enforcing the decree of a lembaga was normally exercised in cases of debt of a Beduanda tribesman to a member of one of the eleven immigrant tribes. For if a tribal chief, who had admitted, however reluctantly, the liability of his tribesman, after session with the chief of an extra tribal plaintiff, did not exact payment, his failure was held to prove his weakness (lemahan), and incapacity for office, and rendered him liable to supersession. Why had he not exercised his power of attachment (tahan tarik) if not on the debtor's own moveable property, then on the belongings of his nearest wealthy relative? No excuse could palliate that omission. But waris property was exempt from attachment by an immigrant tribe: so the question of payment was\n\n\u00b9 Adat lembaga satu ekor kerbau. v. Saying XXI. App. I.\n\u00b2 vide App. I. Saying XIX.\nreferred by the creditor's chief to the Undang, whose order for payment could not be disregarded.\n\nA Waris credit in the eleven tribes the Undang had the power to recover by ordering, on the application of the To' Perba, attachment of the real property of the debtor or his relations. That order could be made only by the Undang, and by him only in recovery of the debt of a non-waris to a waris: though in practice, his permission was commonly invoked after attachment had been effected by the officer in the tribe (b\u0113sar).\n\nAttachment of real property in execution was never followed by sale, but resulted in the officers of the Undang confiscating the moveable property of any member of the debtor's tribe. The formal attachment of land (r\u0113jab) was purely minatory. The subsequent confiscation of goods, of which notice had thus been duly given, was not always peaceably effected. But if the immigrant debtors had the satisfaction of breaking a head or two before paying, they did pay in the end, for the waris prerogative to attach land was indisputable.\n\nA creditor in an immigrant tribe had no such right against either a waris or any other debtor. The eleven tribes could enforce payment only by seizure of moveable property, but if delay ensued the immigrant creditor, on occasion, abandoned his legal remedy and restored to the \"trial by stones\" (s\u0113ngketa batu). He went to his tribal officer, (b\u0113sar), called his kinsmen, donned his shield, seized his sling, and set off to peg out his debtor's land with posts and dig it up,\u00b9 to brand it as a debtor's property. These were extreme measures, and never adopted except in the two cases of a disputed inheritance, or an unpaid marriage fee. The debtor, on his part, was ready, too, to try the case by slings and stones. In the fight that followed wounds were not compensated (pampas), though substitutes were given for the slain, and when the Undang appeared on the field, and fined all warriors impartially, the debtor was satisfied to settle the claim.\n\n\u00b9 vide App. I. Saying XLII.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 56, 1910.\nThe similarity between the \"trial by stones\" and the result of a waris attachment of land has led to a confusion between the two methods of recovery of debt. But whereas the attachment (r\u0113jab) was a recognised and legal prerogative of the waris, the stone trial, though winked at by custom; merely afforded creditor and debtor a ready means of working off their ill-feeling, without incurring liability for assault, and affected not the means but the readiness of the debtor's payment.\n\nThe death penalty,\u2014generally commuted to banishment and confiscation of property,\u00b9\u2014was inflicted under the order of the Undang by the Panglima Dagang. The execution knife (k\u0113ris p\u0113nyalang) was driven between the collar bone and the left shoulder blade into the heart\u2014great precaution being taken to prevent spilling of blood, a prerogative of the Raja,\u00b2 by withdrawing the blade through cloth. The last execution carried out in this way in Rembau, at Kendong in A. D. 1890, was abortive, and the condemned wretch was eventually despatched by police revolvers after he had dropped bound into his freshly dug grave.\n\nDeath, or banishment with confiscation of property,\u00b3 were the only penalties for the forbidden acts (pantang), but for other offences (larang) the minimum penalty inflicted by the Undang in his judicial capacity, was one bahara, ($14.00). On the expulsion of the Raja the Undang adopted the royal fine (66 kupang), but both these fines were independent of the expense of the purificatory feast an offender of rank might incur where a buffalo was slain.\n\nThe Undang is further vested with certain powers in regard to illegitimate children. The sayings record that \"the plant which hath no seed, the sprout which hath no bud belongs to the Undang.\"\u2074 A child whose parentage cannot be established is held by the adat to be the child of the Undang.\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 (1) Buang hidop.\n\u00b2 (2) v.

Straits Branch\nFor that child's up-bringing (b\u00eblanja m\u00ebnetek) the Undang is responsible, and, if a female, for suitable marriage provision. This duty of adoption brought no compensating advantage to the Undang and the most searching tests preceded a claim to his protection. On the pregnancy of an unmarried woman, enquiries into the putative fatherhood are first instituted by the local mosque officials (p\u00ebgawai masjid) who report to the Kathi. The unsupported testimony of the mother is not admitted in evidence. If a prima facie case for parentage be established the Kathi prosecutes the enquiry further, and may order marriage.\n\nIf these enquiries prove fruitless, the spiritual courts have no further jurisdiction, and the question then comes before the lesser tribal officials (p\u00ebgawai Adat). Their finding is based on evidence inadmissible at the previous enquiry. The testimony of witnesses is not essential.\\(^1\\) They may be satisfied that probabilities point to the guilt of an individual, and on such a reference to him the lembaga demands the marriage fees (adat sa'salahan) from the man's waris (relations on the mother's side). Only if the second enquiry produces no result, is the lembaga bound to bring the matter to light in the audience hall of the Undang. Once referred there the question of paternity admits of no further argument, but by the fiction of custom the child, born or unborn, becomes the Undang's offspring. This settlement, however, bears somewhat heavily on the minor chiefs on the mother's side. Each elder and tribal officer would pay a fine of 1 bhara ($14.00) to the Undang for his negligence in permitting such a scandal to rise amongst his anak buah.\n\nThe practice described above is entirely free from the objectionable characteristics which have necessitated the renunciation of the parallel right formerly vested in the Raja in the Negri Sembilan. In Sri Menanti both child and mother became virtual slaves of the Raja. They were forced to reside within the precincts of the royal astana. In Rembau the\n\n\\(^{(1)}\\) Hukum berdiri dengan saksi, adat berdiri dengan tanda.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 56, 1910.\nmother is placed under no restraint. She never leaves her own, or her mother's, house. She is not even brought formally before the Undang in his Balai. On the reference of the Lembaga, it is the Undang who proceeds in state to the house of the Lembaga, inspecting on his way the place where the mother lives. The child remains under the mother's care, but is reared at the charges of the Undang to whose house an occasional visit of a day\\(^1\\) or so is normally paid as the child grows up. The personal rights of the mother suffer no invasion, while she secures for her child the immediate protection of the head of the state.\n\nThe interference of the Undang in purely tribal matters, except on reference of the tribal chief, is abnormal and resented. His consent is necessary to the choice of a tribal chief, who on appointment must make obeisance and he alone can pronounce sentence of official death on the Lembaga:\\(^2\\) but he deals with the tribe only through the chief. A fine inflicted in his Balai is recoverable by the Lembaga, who is responsible for its collection.\n\nThe transference of a tribe to the Undang (suku tergantong pada Undang) alone brought the Undang into direct relations with the members of a tribe. But the history of that institution\\(^3\\) only proves his total unfitness for the work which it entailed upon him.\n\nIt might be argued that by a judicious use of the orang b\u0113sar (vide chapter ii, \u00a7 3), the Undang could stultify the tribal chiefs. Such a view ignores the fact that, except when he was detailed as an officer of the court of the Undang to witness the due performance of a rite or penalty imposed by the Undang as sentence, the initiative lay with the orang B\u0113sar\u2014not with the Undang. Until the B\u0113sar moved and made his specific reference, the grievance of the elder, or the oppression of the Lembaga never reached the ears of the Undang. Again, in his capacity of court officer to the\n\n---\n\n(1) Menyalang.\n(2) v. Saying XXXVII. App. I.\n(3) v. chap. II \u00a71. suku tergantong.\nUndang, the Besar merely represented a judicial authority in which the tribal chief acquiesced, and which he had himself invoked.\n\nIt is however always open to any one desirous of making a display at his daughter's marriage to secure the personal presence and the wedding gift of the Undang (wang pangkas) at the ceremony, by obtaining the latter's permission to kill two head of buffalo for the feast. A Lembaga's adat is comprised in a single buffalo, hence he cannot authorise the major feast without arrogating to himself the right of the Undang. The host at such a feast must then display for his reception the full insignia to which the Undang is entitled (p\u014dsaka undang,) on whose arrival, and departure from the house, a salute of 7 guns is fired (alamat b\u0113rbunyi.)\n\nThe burial ceremonies of the Undang, though including, as do those of the Raja, items common to Undang and Lembaga, differ in kind as well as in degree from the prescribed ritual at the death of a tribal chief. The eighteen various decorations are displayed at the house, the coffin of white wood is borne over a path spread with white cloth to the tomb, where the women bring sireh vessels, water bowls, pots of artificial flowers, braziers. Mourners in advance of the coffin beat the small round gong known as chanang, while four almoners scatter coins on the way. The eight principal chiefs, if present, are entitled, with their wives, to an alms (s\u0113d\u0113kah) of 36 cents apiece, and the lesser officers of State (Hulu Balang) each to 24 cents.\n\nThat portion of the Menangkabau constitution which defines the relation of the (Undang) to the Raja (k\u0113adilan)\u2014long dormant in Rembau during the squabbles over the royal succession, became, after the expulsion of the\n\n(1) v.

The Undang, as a commoner, accords the Yang di Per-Tuan the obeisance (sembah) that is due to royal blood, but he is under no real obligation to do homage on his election, and he refers no matter within his territorial jurisdiction to the kadilan.\nChapter II. Section 6.\n\nThe Raja (Keadilan.)\n\nIn his article on \"the Law and Customs of the Malays with reference to the tenure of land,\" published in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, Straits Branch, for June 1884, Sir W. E. Maxwell states that the Raja possessed the following privileges:\n\n1. The right to share in the grain;\n2. The right to collect taxes;\n3. The right of disposal of waste land;\n\nand proceeds\u2014\"that the proportion of the padi crop which the Malay Raja can claim has come to be fixed by custom at \\(\\frac{1}{10}\\)th of the grain and payment can be enforced by seizure of the crop or land.\"\n\nThis view of the Raja's right is based on the supposition that \"monarchical government was introduced among the Malay tribes by Hindu rulers from India\" and admittedly presumes \"incidents of Aryan kingly government.\" [This hypothesis is sometimes discredited on historical and archaeological grounds.]\n\nThe sayings present a totally different conception of the Raja's position and power.\\(^1\\) The soil\u2014says the adat 'is not owned by the Raja, nor can he levy a war tax but his powers are confined to the administration of justice.'\n\nNewbold in his work on \"the British Settlements in Malacca\"\u2014written in 1835, in treating of the M\u00e9nangkabau States follows the sayings closely in his description of that Raja's powers,\\(^2\\) and the history of the Raja in Negri Sembilan supports the oral tradition.\n\nThe constitution of the Negri Sembilan demanded a Raja merely as head of the Confederacy, and it is most important, in considering the position of the Raja, to remember that his advent was subsequent to the federation of the several states.\n\n\\(^1\\) v. Saying IX. App. I.\n\\(^2\\) v. Newbold op. cit. vol. II pp. 80, 81.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 56, 1910,\nThe insistence by Daing Kamboja, the Bugis overlord, on such other rights as the Hindu hypothesis grants, is what perhaps resulted in his expulsion in 1770 A.D. by a combination of four of the Confederate States.\n\nThe M\u00e9nangkabau Suzerain on the other hand never possessed any but a strictly defined and delegated authority. Newbold agrees with the saying in stating that the Raja was afforded a 'maintenance,' from each land owner in the four States, of a measure of rice, a cluster of coconuts and 25 pieces of money. He was bound to consult and follow the majority verdict of the four Undang on questions referred to him. The sayings flatly deny the obligation on the Undang to supply the Raja with men and material for war, but the necessary contribution of three buffaloes and of alms at a royal marriage, circumcision, or burial feast is admitted by local antiquarians.\n\nThe strictly delegated nature of the M\u00e9nangkabau Raja's authority\u2014a fact established by his method of appointment, on direct application to Pagar Royong\u2014did not preclude his retention of certain prerogatives common to Malay royalty; though it barred any hope of a sentimental hold over the States. His person was sacrosanct (b\u00ebrdaulat), and his office b\u00ebrg\u00eblenggang. The exact significance of b\u00ebrg\u00eblenggang is uncertain, but the term is best interpreted as referring to the royal prerogative of holding high festival at will\u2014and of indulging therein in the gambling and cock fighting dear to Malay court life. His quality of b\u00ebrkhalifah is common to him with the Undang at least in its spiritual significance. His judicial powers extended to inflicting a fine of 66 kupangs, (equivalent to $24.80) which went to his private purse; and only the suzerain could order execution by beheading. The headsman's sword\u2014says the custom\u2014belongs to the Raja.\n\n(1) v. chap. I. p. 17.\n(2) v. Newbold op cit. vol. II. p. 80.\n(3) v. Saying IX. App. I.\n(4) v. Saying X. and cf. chap. II. 5. Undang.\n(5) v. Saying XIX. App. I.\nThe decadence of the M\u00e9nangkabau empire entailed on its subordinate princes a loss of prestige. The Raja\u2019s power over the Federation was shaken by the constant struggles for the succession that followed the death of Linggang Laut in 1824, and the successful self-assertion of Raja Ali, 10 years before, had laid bare the entire dependence of the royal pretentions on public opinion. The appointment of the Yam Tuan Muda in Rembau and J\u00e9l\u00e8bu\u00b9 dealt a death-blow to the suzerain\u2019s authority. Civil war between the contracting states further emphasized the weakness of the royal power, and the efforts of Tengku Radin to regain influence in Rembau by the appointment of the Raja di-Raja failed to secure him public support.\u00b2\n\nIn short, the story of the S\u00e9ri M\u00e9nanti house is a refutation of the validity of the claims of the Raja to monarchical powers. The agreement of 1895 A.D. whereby an alliance of five states was created \u2018under the name of the Negri Sembilan,\u2019 expressly excluded the Yam Tuan of S\u00e9ri M\u00e9nanti\u2014as a contracting chief, from \u2018exercising any other powers or authority in respect of any State than that which he then possessed.\u2019 The later agreement of 1898 A.D. while purporting to re-establish the \u2018ancient constitution\u2019 debarred the Raja from interference in the internal government of the States, robbed him of any original jurisdiction, (clause 4), relieved the Undang (clause 5) of the duty of homage at the great religious feasts and (clause 6) of personally providing the offering formerly required at royal festival.\n\nAs the British treaty with Rembau of A.D. 1883 had already denied the Raja the right of interference in the appointment of the Undang, subsequent treaty definitions of his power have left little to the suzerain but ceremonial precedence as nominal head of the Federation.\n\nThe constitution of the court of the suzerain, and the ceremonial at his installation are dealt with in such detail in\n\n\u00b9 J.

This is of two kinds:\n\n(a) The joint earnings of husband and wife during marriage, (charian laki bini).\n\n(b) Property acquired by a male prior to his marriage or while a widower, (charian bujang).

There is no such thing as joint ownership by the inhabitants of a village or tract, of cultivated lands.\" This dictum is the conclusion drawn from two premises, that proprietary right is created by the clearing of the soil followed by continuous occupation, and that the right to land is absolute so long as occupation continues or the land bears signs of appropriation.\n\nRights of Settler.\n\nThe settler did not however acquire a free title, even during occupancy, for \"the doctrine that the soil of the Malay States is vested in the Raja is not now to be questioned\" and \"the settler's right was absolute only so long as a proportion of the grain was paid to the Raja.\"\n\nIn Rembau, as the sayings prove, rights to land were based on clearing and effective occupation, but to that limited extent only, does the dictum of Maxwell hold good for Rembau, in regard to proprietary rights in real property. The soil of the state vested in the aborigines, and from them passed to the heirs (waris)\u2014the descendants of aboriginal mothers by marriage with the earliest immigrants. As settlers of the eleven immigrant tribes entered the country they acquired from the \"waris\" not merely the plots of land actually cleared by them, but the right in perpetuity to considerable tracts embracing valleys or portions of valleys adapted for rice cultivation.\n\nRedeemed Lands (Tanah bertebus)\n\nThe tracts of country thus acquired by a nominal payment or by a promise of payment never fulfilled, are known as redeemed lands (tanah bertebus). On redeemed lands no tax or tithe on grain or crop was paid to Undang or to tribal chief.\n\nThere were left, then, to the waris after the redemption of tribal tracts, the hills and forests and such valleys suitable for rice cultivation as were not redeemed. These two classes of land are known as Forest lands (Utan tanah) and unredeemed lands, (tanah ta' bertebus) or waris land (tanah waris).\n\n(i) Forest Lands (Utan Tanah).\n(ii) Unredeemed Lands (Tanah Waris).\n\n(1) vide op. cit. p. 89. (2) vide op. cit. 90.\n(3) vide Saying XXIII App. I. (4) vide Saying XVI. App. I.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nDifferent rights were obtained by the occupiers of holdings in these different classes of land.\n\nIt is of cardinal importance to bear in mind that redeemed lands were tribal lands. The sayings amply prove this fact. \"Where the coconuts are tall\\(^1\\) and the betel palms in rows, that land belongs to the tribal chief,\" the guardian of the inherited rights of the tribe. So far from there being \"no such thing as joint ownership by the inhabitants of a tract of cultivated lands\" the land was not an individual but a common property in the early days of Rembau tribal history. But as time elapsed a family (perut)\u2014an exogamic unit\u2014in a tribe acquired by length of effective occupation, a transmissible, but not an alienable, right to a particular plot of rice swamp in the redeemed valley, and to the high land (kampong) on which the houses stood. Such an ancestral holding ranks colloquially as the property of the mother of that family\u2014but the nominal holder at any given moment is merely a fiduciary for the family ancestral property is vested in females of tribe in tail female.\n\nTradition ascribes this custom to the direct order of the fabled law giver Dato' Perpatih Pinang Sa-batang,\\(^2\\) and Mr. Hale\\(^3\\) has sought its origin in a survival from savage times, but it is evident that this provision is a corollary to the idea of the exogamic tribal unit.\n\nSettlers on unredeemed lands (tanah waris) became nominally tenants for life of the waris, the heirs of the soil, and could obtain no transmissible or alienable right in their holdings. They paid a yearly tribute to the Undang\u2014the infra tribal head of all the waris, not to the waris tribal chief\u2014of a packet of parched rice and a measure of husked rice (emping sa'kampit bras sa'gantang).\n\nWaris land, as still the property of the waris although in the occupation of a tenant, was not subject to\n\n---\n\n(1) vide Saying XVIII App. I.\n(2) vide Newbold Brit.

On the death of the tenant the Undang had the right, though its exercise was infrequent, to terminate occupation by the tenants' family. In many cases settlers on unredeemed lands have been in undisturbed occupation of their holdings for generations\u2014succession following the rule of inheritance in ancestral property, but such occupation supports no claim to like rights with those of a holder of redeemed lands.\\(^1\\)\n\nForest lands presented to a settler little attraction, except the durian orchards (dusun) on the hills. To such an orchard a right similar to the acquired right of a family in redeemed lands might be secured and maintained by the clearing of a space round the fruit trees. The communal nature within the family (p\u0113rut) of the right to an orchard is a matter of observation at the present day, and affords valuable corroborative evidence as to the limits of proprietary rights in redeemed lands. Even since titles were issued (in A.D. 1888) the registered owner of an ancestral orchard in the hills claims no alienable right to the trees, nor would she seek to prevent any of her relatives, who can trace descent to a common ancestor with herself, from sharing in the profits of the durian harvest. The broad principle of succession to ancestral land has already been remarked, the same provision holds good in regard to ancestral property in chattels. The property is held in tail for the nearest female relative\u2014the daughter.\n\nShould there be more than one daughter, it is the duty of the father, or the husband, to build a house for his daughter, or wife, on a convenient site in the ancestral. The mother's house is inherited normally by the youngest daughter, who undertakes, in return, the support of her mother in old age. The rice swamp is divided equally between the sisters. Should a daughter predecease her mother, her female descendants obtain collectively an equal share with their aunts.\n\n\\(^{(1)}\\) cf. Matnor and To\u2019 Muda Lansah v.s. Tukang Rahman; heard in 1906, and upheld on appeal. Land in dispute waris land at Chuai, claimed by waris against Rahman descendant of tenant.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nThe rule for succession to ancestral property may be thus formulated:\n\nAncestral property\u2014real and personal,\u2014descends to daughters or their direct descendants, *per stirpes* not *per capita*.\n\nIn the event of the holder of ancestral property dying without issue, the inheritance reverts to the nearest living female relative of the same family the *waris yang kadim*\u2014normally sisters or nieces, *per stirpes*. In default of these, or should the nearest relative refuse the inheritance, to which by custom she is entitled, ancestral property descends to that relative in the tribe, even if not the nearest of kin, who had supported the deceased holder in her old age, provided that nearer kinsfolk had not offered her a home. Should the deceased holder have entirely supported herself, the property would descend to relatives of the degree of first cousins (*sa'anak dato*) or, in default thereof, to more distant cousins (*sa'anak nenek* or *moiang*).\n\nIt is clear then that the failure of female heirs is an extremely remote contingency. The custom, however, which debarred males from inheriting ancestral property, did contemplate a failure of heirs. Ancestral property to which no female heirs existed was known as \"suspended inheritance\" (*pesaka gantong*) and male children or agnate relatives might memorialise the Undang for permission to dispose of such property.\n\nTo the denial of inheritance to male children in ancestral property the custom admits one exception. Weapons or male ornaments and clothing, the males of the family may receive\u2014but as a concession, not as a right. Such benefits, known as \"the path of the eye\" (chenderong mata), are granted as a sign of the blood connection between the female inheritors and their brothers.\n\nThe disability of the male to succeed to ancestral property has been modified by late usage. At a meeting of the Negri\n\n(1) In the State of Naning, where the same custom obtains as in Rembau, the chenderong mata takes the shape of a fruit tree reserved for the male in the ancestral kampong.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 56, 1910.\nSembilan State Council in 1899 it was decided to permit to a male life-tenancy of ancestral lands in default of female heirs of the same degree. Under this ruling, if the holder of ancestral property leave issue one son only, that son is entitled, should he press his claim to succeed to the ancestral lands, held by his mother, as tenant for life. At his death, those lands revert to his nearest female relative in the tribe. To ensure this ultimate reversion to the female heirs, the name of the person entitled to the reversionary interest in the ancestral property is now inserted, together with that of the male life tenant, in the customary title for the land.\n\nIt would appear, then, at first sight, that the position of a male even in his own family circle is subordinate to his sisters to a degree inconsistent with equity. He gives his labour in the rice swamp in which, under strict customary law, he can never acquire a proprietary interest. He brings to his mother's home some portion, at least, of his earnings as a bachelor, and should he die unmarried and in the care of his mother or sisters, what property he may possess becomes theirs. But in practice his position is not without compensation of a substantial kind.\n\nThe male is not denied by custom all the usufruct of ancestral property. The fruit of trees he plants in the ancestral kampong is his to sell or enjoy. When he leaves his home to marry or search for fortune (menchari untong) in the world, custom allows him to take away with him cash or kind, a share of his mother's property (herta terbawa), though it grants at the same time to his mother a lien on that property, on his divorce or death. If misfortune is all his bachelor life brings him, then his family is liable for his debts, unless, indeed, he can find a woman willing to marry him thus encumbered.\n\nThese duties of a mother to her sons arise from the principle that the holder of ancestral property is responsible for the life and blood of all members of the family. Life and blood, says the custom, belong to the waris.\\(^1\\)\n\n(1) vide App. I Saying XLI.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nThe applications of this tenet are manifold. Interpreted literally, it explains the custom of substitution as the penalty for murder, or even for slayings that would now be classed as homicide or justifiable homicide.\\(^1\\)\n\nBefore the sway of the *adat* was tempered by western ideas of justice, if a tribesman by slaying a member of another tribe, caused depreciation of the assets of that tribe, the balance between the two tribes was readjusted by substitution\u2014(*balas*). A member of the slayer\u2019s family was given to the victim\u2019s tribe, in exchange for the slain. That substitute, who was normally of the same sex as the slain, was selected by the tribal chief, and passing into the tribe of the slain, became heir to the same rights and privileges as persons born into that tribe.\n\nThis rule discovers the standpoint of tribal custom. The tribe, not the individual, is the unit of consideration. A murdered man was just so much dead loss to his tribe, which could not balance its accounts by recording the fact of a death in another tribe.\n\nIf the slayer and the slain were of the same tribe, then as restitution could not adjust the balance, the family of the slayer paid as a fine one buffalo and fifty bushels of husked rice. But as the Rembau tribal system was based on exogamy, the wife of the slayer had her part to bear in the restitution. The burial expenses of the victim, and the cost of the funeral feasts, on the third day (*niga hari*) the seventh day (*mnujoh hari*), and the hundredth day (*saratus hari*) were borne by the wife and children of the murderer. These payments were known as the \u201cfollowing of the substitute\u201d (*iring balas*). If the slayer were unmarried, the substitution, or the payment of the customary fine, as the case might be, closed the incident, as far as his family was concerned. The man himself was content to fly the country, when he incurred sentence of outlawry.\\(^2\\) The elders (*ibu-bapa*) and tribal\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) vide App. Saying XXXIV.\n\n\\(^2\\) cf. case of Ma\u2019adam, Suku Anak Acheh outlawed for murder by Dato\u2019 Serun; returned after Serun\u2019s death (1905) and was by order of the State Council again outlawed from the Negri Sembilan in 1906.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 56, 1910.\nofficers (b\u0113sar) of the slayer\u2019s village were liable to a fine of one bhara ($14.20), payable to the Undang, for their negligence in permitting a quarrel to end so disastrously for the tribe. The murder of a member of the waris tribe was paid for by a five-fold restitution, and if a blood relation of the Undang (dibawah paiong kembang) were slain, seven substitutes were taken.\n\nBut the waris tribe never gave a substitute. Even murder was no sufficient reason for the degradation of an heir of the soil to the level of an immigrant tribesman. The murdered man\u2019s tribe might kidnap a waris child, and generally made an armed demonstration against the waris family implicated, but the desultory fighting that ensued, culminated only in the arrival of the Undang who dealt out fines with impartial hand to elders, tribal officers, and warriors.\n\nIt is recorded that during the Undangship of Dato\u2019, Akhir (A.D., 1838-71.) a Kampar man, then affiliated to the Tanah Datar tribe, being slain by a waris of kampong T\u0113bat, a band of Kampar men attempted to extort restitution from the Undang whom they approached through the Dato\u2019 Maharaja Inda\u2014tribal chief of the Tanah Datar tribe. The demand was refused, but the waris Tebat were ordered to pay a fine of $100, together with the customary buffalo and rice, and to receive the Kampar men into their section of the waris tribe. Kampar settlers in Rembau thus left the Tanah Datar tribe, and became affiliated to the waris tribe, ranking as Beduanda Dagang.\n\nThe second application of the principle is seen in the obligation of the holder of ancestral property to pay the debts of the bachelors of the family. Under Malay rule an insolvent debtor became the slave of his creditor; he paid his debts in his body. The settlement of his debts alone preserved his free life, and hence became a duty of his mother\u2019s family. The obligation to payment extended not only to the private debts of the bachelor, his unpaid bills, his less happy speculations, and his losses at the gaming table,\u2014but also to the\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nebts known as debts-of-custom (utang adat). A man holding an office under the tribal constitution (orang beradat,) exposes himself, as has been shown in the chapter dealing with the constitution, to customary fines for actions and omissions connected solely with his official position.\\(^1\\) Failure to meet the fine involves his deposition, and casts a slur on his family. A like taint (chachat) on the family results from failure to carry out, in full detail, the prescribed ritual at the funeral of a constitutional official.\\(^2\\) The holder of the ancestral property is therefore bound to step into the breach and save, by payment of these debts, the official life of the peasant bachelor, or maintain by means of the ancestral property the inherited rights (pesaka) of the family.\n\nAgain, in execution of the same principle, the inheritor of the ancestral property is bound to provide a home for the males of the family before marriage, on divorce, or in sickness. The tribesman may wander afar secure in the knowledge that his ancestral swamp will be tilled, and the garden tended by his mother and sisters, to whom he can always return for shelter, maintenance, and assistance. If he comes back only to die, he has still the cold assurance that his funeral, and all contingent feasts, will be duly provided out of the family estate.\n\nBut the duties which the possession of ancestral property entails on the holder are not confined to the preservation of the \"life and blood\" of the males.\n\nShe is responsible also for the expenses known as the debts of inheritance. (Utang persaka). These fall under the following headings:\n\n(1) Expenses of marriage, or fines incurred in connection with marriage. All forms of irregular marriage entail on the groom the payment of a fine to the tribal chief, or the provision of special garments, and presents.\n\n(2) Expenses of burying the late holder of the property and of feasts in connection therewith.\n\n\\(^{(1)}\\) vide chap. II. section 2, 3 and 4.\n\n\\(^{(2)}\\) vide Appendix VI.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 56, 1910.\n(3) The purchase of the title of Haji for the deceased parent. (Beli haji).\u00b9\n\n(4) Expenses of the feast known as \"Tamat kampong.\" This feast takes place once a year at the family grave-yard, and is of the nature of a family reconciliation\u2014a burying of all the year's little differences between brother and sister, parent and child.\n\n(5) The expenses of a religious education, (m\u00e9nuntut.) This charge is only due in respect of education in a foreign country, and is rarely incurred in Rembau. But the departure of a tribesman to Kelantan to acquire religious instruction is a common event in the state of Naning.\n\n(6) Assistance towards the cost of the pilgrimage to Mecca.\n\nThe holder is further bound to maintain the ancestral property intact. This obligation, it is true, is implicit in her position as a tenant, but calls for attention as the ground on which the daughters base their demands to a division of the property during the life-time of their mother. Veneration for years is a sentiment perhaps not wholly without the range of Rembau experience, but filial affection for an aged relative is conspicuously absent from Rembau practice. The advanced age of the mother is accepted as proof positive of her inability to perform her duty of preserving the property intact, and she may be forced to transmit her interest.\n\nIn the event of this transmission, the aged holder is commonly allowed to retain in her own name a small plot in the ancestral rice swamp to guarantee her burial expenses.\u00b2 She will speak of such a plot as her shroud (k\u00e9pan). The relative who actually pays those expenses becomes thereby\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 The purchaser of the title of Haji for a deceased relative gives money (minimum $20, usually $40,) to a pilgrim. Arrived at Mecca this agent pays the money to the Sheikh, who buys the robe and turban of a pilgrim, and deposits them in the mosque at Mecca, offering up the customary prayers.\n\n\u00b2 Instead of reserving the plot, it may pass directly as a gift (pembrian) to a relative guaranteeing the burial expenses.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nentitled to the land so reserved as a guarantee, but is bound, should she enjoy the usufruct of that land pending the holder's death, to feed and support her aged relative.\n\nThe sale, or mortgage, of ancestral property outside the family or tribe is strictly forbidden, as contrary to the principles underlying the possession of tribal property. Alienation is permissible only if necessary to the performance of such duties of the holder of the property as the payment of the debts of custom or inheritance.\\(^1\\) The sole exception to this rule is a concession to religion.\n\nA holder of ancestral property, to which no immediate heirs exist, may dispose of that property to pay for pilgrimage to Mecca. She must however grant an option of purchase to her tribe before seeking a buyer elsewhere. Under Malay rule, if a buyer was found in another tribe, the tribal chiefs of either party met on the land, beat the bounds, and planted posts to mark it off, before the price was paid.\\(^2\\)\n\nThe consideration of acquired property (herta charian), and of the rules governing inheritance thereto, pertains rather to the treatment of the custom relating to marriage-settlements and divorce. A brief statement will be sufficient here.\n\nAcquired property, as has been stated, is of two kinds:\u2014\n\n(1) Acquired during wedlock: (charian laki bini).\n\n(2) Acquired by a male whilst a bachelor, or widower (charian bujang).\n\n(1) Property acquired during the wedlock, the joint earnings of man and wife, descends on the death of the wife to the female issue: on the death of the husband, it vests in the widow, for the benefit of the female issue.\\(^3\\)\n\nWhen that acquired property has once passed into the possession of the children, it ranks, thence forward, as an-\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) vide supra p. 73.\n\\(^2\\) vide App. I.

This rule holds good even should he have married and taken that property with him to his wife's house, or, if in land, have granted the usufruct to his wife. Property of which the wife thus obtains the temporary use is known as brought property. (herta pembawa).\n\n\\(^{(1)}\\) vide App. I. Saying XL\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nChapter IV.\n\nThe Custom as Relating to Marriage and Divorce.\n\nThe tribes composing the Federation of Rembau are domestically independent corporations. Tribal descent is traced through the mother, and tribal independence is conserved by two rules, exogamy and monogamy.\n\nThe tribe, however, is not the exogamic unit. The inter-marriage of sections of certain tribes is permitted by custom. B\u0113duanda Jakun may marry with B\u0113duanda Jawa, and the B\u0113duanda dagang with either. In the Mungkal tribe (Darat), a member of the Bukit family, may wed a member of the T\u0113bat family, but between the two sections of the Bukit family\u2014Bukit and K\u0113ling\u2014marriage is forbidden. A concession to agnate descent, even, is made in the solitary case of the Tiga Nen\u0113k and Paia Kumboh (Baroh) tribes, two of the four tribes of the first Rembau immigration. As the two pioneer chiefs of these tribes were half brothers, the tribes do not intermarry. These examples are sufficient to show that the test of an exogamic unit is distinction of origin. The inability of two families (p\u0113ru\u1e6d) to trace descent to a common female ancestor\u2014inability that may be due either to certainty of pedigree, or to the fact of belated settlement obscuring ancestry,\u2014is their passport to intermarriage.\n\nBreach of exogamic custom is considered an offence of the first magnitude, and amounts to incest. Yet custom distinguishes between the incestuous liason of persons related merely as members of one tribe, (sa-waris) and incest of near blood relations, (waris kadim.) The former crime, known as sumbang sa-waris, was strictly punishable with outlawry and confiscation of property: but the Undang had the power to commute this penalty to a fine of one bhara ($14.00), 50 measures of husked rice, and one buffalo. The Paia-Kumboh tribe provides the standard instance of the commuted penalty.\n\n(1) A complete list of the exogamic units in each of the 12 tribes will be found in appendix II.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 56, 1910.\nA woman of that tribe having been outlawed on an incestuous union, performed the pilgrimage to Mecca, on her husband's death. On her return she obtained permission from the Undang\u2014Dato' S\u00e9run\u2014at the instance of Dato' Merbangsa her tribal chief, to reside again in Rembau, on payment of the statutory fee. It is to be remarked that in this case the penalty was commuted after the husband's death, tradition records no like communication during the life-time of both guilty persons.\n\nIncest of near relations (sumbang kadim) or sumbang balai melintang \\(^1\\) was nominally a capital offence, but actually punished with outlawry and confiscation of property, a penalty which the Undang had no power to commute.\\(^2\\) So great is the insistence of custom on exogamy that immediate remarriage into the tribe of a divorced wife is an offence. Elder jurists class such a marriage as incestuous, but under existing practice, if previous notice be given him, a tribal chief may sanction the marriage on payment of the fee known as Kalang Batang \\(^3\\) a fee of 20 rupia ($7.20.) This rule is the more striking that marriage with a deceased wife's sister an event known as \"changing the mat\"\\(^4\\) (ganti tikar) is extremely common.\n\nThe practice of monogamy has survived longer in Rembau than in any other state of the Negri Sembilan, but is gradually losing ground to the licence granted by Mohammedan law. The general observance of the monogamic rule, which as will be shown later, is a logical deduction from the customary theory of marriage, provoked caustic comment from the Sultan of Johor, on his visit to Rembau in 1874, A.D.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Literally; incest traversing the Lawgiver's Hall of Audience.\n\n\\(^2\\) In Naning the death penalty was exacted. There is a legend current at Pulau Sebang, Naning, that a man and woman of the Seri Melenggang tribe found guilty of incest, were placed in baskets and drowned in the stream running past the Mosque. The site of their grave,\u2014the Jirat Sumbang\u2014is still pointed out.\n\n\\(^3\\) Kalang (Galang) batang is the obstructing tree truuk.\n\n\\(^4\\) If the parties agree it is not uncommon to dispense with payment of Adat on marriage of a man to his sister-in-law.\neven as late as A.D. 1898, Mr. Hale wrote\\(^1\\) that \"there are only three men in Rembau with more than one wife.\" Although there are many more today, and though the fee due to the Undang\\(^2\\) on contracting a double marriage is not always exacted, yet polygamy is discredited in Rembau, and is practised chiefly by police, whose conduct may charitably be supposed to be influenced rather by frequent change of abode, than by strength of religious conviction.\n\nA marriage or liaison with a woman of the same tribe as the wife, during her coverture,\u2014an offence against both exogamic and monogamic rule,\u2014was punishable with death. This crime is known to customary law as the sugar-palm with two ladders,\\(^3\\) and is classed, together with the possession of a familiar spirit, (p\u00e8l\u00e8sit) as a tabooed act. (pantang).\n\nThe Rembau method of arranging a marriage presents few features differing from the usual Malay practice: but the following account may be given as a concise statement of the desiderata of a good match, and the sequence of events culminating in formal betrothal and marriage.\\(^4\\)\n\n\"Now these are the (preliminary) arrangements with regard to engagements for marriage. As the saying runs, alive we are, in the grip of custom, dead in the grip of the ground: fortune soars away, misfortune swoops sudden. Take a particular instance; you want to marry into a certain tribe, and your fancy lights on so and so. Wait a day or two, a month, or a year; see if everything is as you would wish it. What do you mean? Well, your intended wife's relations, and how they bring up their children. Say there are both boys and girls\u2014the boys learning the Koran, the girls learning to keep house.

Then a token is given\u2014taking the form of a ring. The ring is equivalent to a definite proposal: if the proposal is accepted the ring is taken, it is returned if the proposal is refused. Let us suppose it is accepted, and accepted authoritatively. Another ring seals the compact: a formal agreement is made, to be fulfilled commonly in 7 days, at the outside in 14 days, at the least in two days, running on to three. Let us suppose the period is 7 days: no slight fault invalidates the contract, but outrageous behaviour renders it void. The agreement is made, it is publicly announced, in due time it is fulfilled. Let us take it as fulfilled:\u2014you are bidden by the relatives of your betrothed to conclude the compact. You must first pay the marriage fee in public, speaking these words:\u2014Here it is, I waste no words: as the phrase goes, Lift the leaf, and take the marrow.\"\u00b9\n\nThe amount of the marriage fee varies with the tribe.\u00b2 Until the year 1906, a fee of \"twenty\" meant twenty rupia, (20 x 36 cents-$7.20) but the Undang and chiefs agreed in that year to substitute the dollar for the rupia as the unit. The normal fee at present is therefore $20.00.\n\nThe procedure described above refers to the conventional marriage of a virgin, arranged by the relations on either side: The marriage of a widow or divorcee is a far more prosaic event, may be concluded immediately on acceptance of the suitor, and involved, formerly, a fee of only 12 rupia ($4.32).\n\nThe engagement, in either case, may be broken if the suitor is insane, leprous, impotent, or lost to sense of shame, when the marriage fee is returned by the bride's relations.\n\n(1) The custom of Tunggu Adat\u2014the vigil of the groom at the bride's house consequent on the payment of the marriage fee is not observed in Rembau, though practised in the neighbouring state of Naning.\n\n(2) For list of fees payable in each tribe vide appendix II.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nThe discovery of a suitor's low birth, or of the fact that a customary slur (chachat) rests on his family, provides no valid reason for the cancellation of an engagement once formally concluded.\\(^1\\) The suitor, on his part, may decline to fulfill the engagement if his betrothed suffers from dropsy or hemorrhoids, is insane, or incapable of consummating the marriage, (ratka).\n\nIf the suitor refuse, for an inadequate reason, to proceed to marriage he forfeits the marriage fee, the gage of betrothal, (tanda) and the presents given by him, but retains the presents he has received.

If a buffalo is killed for the feast, the sanction and presence of the tribal chief is essential to the ceremony. Poorer folk are content with killing a goat or fowls, and conclude the feasting in one\n\n---\n\n(1) vide Saying 48, App. I.\n(2) vide Saying 45, App. I.\n(3) Newbold Br. Settlements in Malacca, vol. II, p. 248 calls this offence Angkara: the term is unknown in Rembau.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 56, 1910.\nevening, they therefore require the permission only of the Elder (ibu-bapa). A lavish wedding ceremony lasts for five nights, involves the provision of two or three head of buffalo, and demands the sanction of the Undang.\\(^1\\)\n\nBut there are speedier means of concluding a marriage than the method described: and irregular marriages, equally binding with the union consequent to a formal betrothal, are not infrequent in Rembau.\n\nCustom acknowledges four classes of irregular marriage.\n\n(I). The marriage by surprise. *(Terkurong didalam).* When a man and woman are caught together inside the house, they are compelled by custom to wed. Their capture may be wholly fortuitous, or the result of set purpose,\u2014either person having arranged a surprise. News of the capture is despatched forthwith to the tribal chiefs of man and girl, and the lover is not permitted to leave the house till his tribal chief has guaranteed payment of the price of guilt,\u2014the *adat sa-salahan.*\\(^2\\) If the man\u2019s family delayed payment, the tribal chief was, under Malay rule, empowered to levy the fee, as being a debt-of-inheritance, on the ancestral property of the man\u2019s family, in the manner prescribed by custom.\\(^3\\) A chief failing to exact payment was guilty of abetment of the offence,\\(^4\\) and liable to deposition by the Undang.\n\nThe amount of the fee varies with the tribe involved. Formerly, the entire payment was made not in cash, but in white cloth, bearing a fictitious value of six cents per cubit (*hasta*). The cloth was divided between the girl\u2019s family and\n\n---\n\n(1) The marriage ceremonial of the low-country (*baroh*) district differs slightly from the inland (*darat*) practice. In the *Baroh* district the bride is not brought out to meet her betrothed on the verandah, as in the *Darat*, during the first two days\u2019 feasting: and the *Baroh* practice of sending a bridal deputation to escort the groom\u2019s litter to the house of the bride immediately prior to the ceremonial bathing, is dispensed with in the *Darat* district.\n\n(2) For amount of fee in the various tribes see App. II.\n\n(3) v. chap. II. p. sub Lembaga.\n\n(4) *Melindong*, vide chap. II. p.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nher tribal chief, who shared with the Elder, and he again with\nthe tribal officers (Besar)\u00b9 and male relatives of the woman\n(anak-buah), present at the surprise. Modern practice re-\nquires payment in cash to the woman, but the chiefs' share is\nstill occasionally paid in kind. In order to avoid an imagi-\nnary\u00b2 violation of Mohammedan law, the formula pronounced\nby the wali at the ensuing marriage (I......marry......with a\nmarriage fee of...........)\u00b3 omits reference to the portion of the\nfee paid to the tribal chief and elder. Under Malay rule, though\nmarriage was the necessary complement of a surprise, the man\nmight suffer vicariously, if he could find a relative in his tribe\nwilling to take his place. At the present day it is held that\nthe man must marry in person, but he is at liberty to divorce\nthe woman next day on payment of 14 maru (35 cents).\n\n(II). The marriage by surrender. (S\u0113rah meny\u0113rah).\nA man desirous of effecting a marriage in this way mounts\nthe verandah of the girl's house, (panjat rumah), takes up his\nposition there, and refuses to budge. It is then open to the\ngirl's relations (waris pr\u0113mpuan) to remove her and leave the\nman in undisturbed possession of the house, without light or\nfood. If he persevere in his intention, he remains in the house\ndependent for light and sustenance on the charity of his own\nfamily: until the parents of the girl surrender to his obstinacy,\nand consent to the match.\n\nAn Elder is competent to sanction a marriage of this\nform, on payment of the ordinary marriage fee, together with the\nfine of the \"bunga pinang,\"\u2074 a change of clothing, (persalinan)\nand the fee of the \"wrapping of the ring\" (kain d\u0113raan\nchinchin).\u2075 Custom presumes that, with so many other\n\n---\n\n(1) The share of the besar is 12 cents.\n(2) The Arabic mahr, or payments by groom to bride, are the\nperquisite of the woman.

A. Soc., No. 56, 1910.\nmethods open to him, no man will seek marriage in this way without counting the cost; hence, although the ordinary marriage fee only is exacted, a surrender marriage is theoretically the most costly form for the male; and corresponds roughly to the method known in other parts of the Peninsula as the \"rich man's capture\" (tangkap kaia). The fine (bunga pinang) is divided between the Elder and the tribal officers, who share again with the male relations of the woman. The exact cost of a surrender marriage has varied from time to time in Rembau. In early days the bunga pinang amounted only to 6 rupia, ($2.88), and 9 rupia covered the two special fees, which were paid to the family of the woman. The fine was subsequently raised to $6.00, and the special fees to a minimum of $12.00, though the bride's family might demand any reasonable sum. But with the recent substitution of the dollar for the rupia in the marriage fee, the total expense of a surrender marriage, was fixed at $26.00, and the special fees for garments and wrapping of the ring abolished, as customary debts.\n\n(III). The marriage by storm. (M\u00ebrumahi).\u00b9 The existence of this form, the essential feature of which is the violence used to obtain the bride, guarantees marriage to a plucky man, despite his lack of property or physical attractions. The man forces his way into the woman's chamber, and lays hands on her. If he succeeds in carrying her off, either against her will or with her consent, he must leave the state. The woman in that event obtains no marriage fee, for none is paid on her seizure, and if her parents invite the couple to return, they forfeit all claim to the fee.\n\nAs an alternative to flight, the man may refuse to release the woman, and submit to whatever bodily castigation her relations inflict. If they fail to induce him to retire, he has won the right to marry. No action for criminal trespass will lie against the suitor, as this method of obtaining a wife is legitimized by custom.\n\n\u00b9 lit : the house taking.\nIf the man takes his beating, the same marriage fee is due as for a \"surprise\" marriage (I) and was formerly payable in cloth, but if the parents accept the inevitable, and the marriage is concluded the same evening, then the ordinary fee only is paid.\n\nThe marriage by storm can be effected only at the instance of the male. The marriage \"by robbery\" is unknown in Rembau; but a Rembau wife need never share her husband with another woman. His first wife has the right to redeem sole interest in her husband, if he contract a second marriage during her coverture. The procedure laid down directs her to make her way to the house of the second wife, lightly clad with a naked weapon in her hand, mount the steps, and offer a sum for the release of her husband. If the second wife prefer to pay the sum named to relinquishing her man, she can buy out the interests of the first wife at that price. This procedure is known as redeeming the husband (b\u0113li laki) and though seldom put into practice, is well recognised as legitimate.\n\nIV. The marriage with a condition clause. (Nikah Ta'alik). At marriage of this kind the following clause is inserted in the formula (khutbah) read by the wali:\u2014\"If the husband is absent on land six months, at sea one year, without message or tidings, divorce has ripened of itself.\" To dispel any subsequent question as to the fact of its use, the clause should be reduced to writing, and signed by the husband. The marriage thus expressly contemplates and provides facilities for divorce.\n\nTo class as irregular the \"marriage with a condition\" which differs from the regular marriage not in the method of\n\n(1) The custom of the marriage by robbery which obtains in Naning, (r\u0113but rampas) permits a woman to force a marriage with the man of her choice, even against his will. To obtain a husband in this way a woman publicly seizes some article of the man's clothing, and holds it as a pledge. Custom accepts such immodesty as proof of previous intercourse between man and woman under promise of marriage and holds the man to his presumed contract.\n\n(2) Kedarat anam bulan, ka-laut sa'tahun, berp\u0113san tidak, b\u0113rita tidak, talak gugor sendiri. Saying XLIV.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 56, 1910.\nsecuring the bride, but only in case of dissolving the tie between husband and wife, is perhaps to introduce a fresh differentium. In Naning the formula read at the wedding ceremony following either betrothal or any variety of bride-capture, frequently does include this clause:\u00b9 and consequently, in that state, the clause is held merely an accident of marriage. But a Rembau woman would resent the suggestion that her marriage formula contained the divorce clause. That safeguard in needed, and used, only if a foreign Malay (orang dagang) is taken as husband. Hence in Rembau the nikah ta\u2019alik, not only as pregnant with divorce, but as confined to foreign alliances, is sharply distinguished from any other form of marriage, and is popularly regarded as a legitimate rather than a respectable union.\n\nOn marriage a man passes from his mother\u2019s tribe to become a lodger in his wife\u2019s home. The married man belongs, as the saying runs, to the place of his marriage.\u00b2 Loss or gain of married life affects solely the wife.\u00b3 The interest of his mother\u2019s family in a married man is confined to his \u201clife and blood.\u201d\u2074\n\nHe does not, however, necessarily, go penniless to his new house.\n\nThe property brought by a man to his wife on marriage is of two kinds:\u2014\n\n(1). A share of the ancestral property taken away with the consent of his mother\u2019s family (herta terbawa).\n\n(2). Property forming his share of the earnings of a former marriage, or acquired by him as a bachelor, (herta pembawa).\n\nAll such property must be declared before, or at the time of marriage, in the presence of witnesses. From this declaration guns, cannon, buffaloes, or gold sheathed weapons\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 The Naning formula differs slightly from the Rembau clause, reading \u201cKudarat anam bulan, ka-laut sa\u2019tahun, berpesan tidak, berita tidak tuan Kathi gugorkan satu talak.\u201d\n\n\u00b2 v. App. I. Saying II.\n\n\u00b3 v. App. I. Saying XLI.\n\n\u2074 v. App. I. Saying XLI.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nare exempt, as their possession would be a matter of notoriety. The debts of a bridegroom must similarly be declared, or the wife may repudiate her liability therein. The necessity for the declaration arises from the fact that the wife obtains no permanent interest in property thus settled upon her. She has the use only during married life. On divorce or death property brought by him on marriage reverts to the husband, or his family.\n\nThere is no dowry in Rembau. Custom speaks of the \"acquisitions\" of a husband on marriage, (pendapatan), but he obtains no rights whatever over the separate estate of his wife. Pendapatan means, not a dowry, but the benefits accruing to a man on marriage, and may be confined to his daily rice, and the roof over his head.\n\nBut if the responsibility for a husband's welfare rests with his wife, his relative position is one of inferiority. He is at the beck and call of his relations by marriage;\u00b9 his mother-in-law boasts that she can find some use for any sort of son\u2014the clever may be cajoled, and the fool bullied: the blind man can be put to pound the rice: the cripple to mind the padi drying in the sum: the deaf to fire the cannon and the braggart to take the hard knocks.\n\nThe mother's predominance in the home is patent to her children and has prevented the growth of a sincere filial affection for the father. The attitude of children to their father is one of toleration tempered by as much sentiment as is expressed in the dictum that \"after all they are of his flesh and blood:\"\u00b2 a reflection which pales before the fact that the \"life and blood\" of the father is the care not of the children, but of their paternal grand-mother or aunts.\n\nThe use of the term \"cherai\" is not confined, as is the word divorce, to an unnatural severence of the marriage tie: but extends also to dissolution of marriage by the death of either party, (cherai mati) as well as to separation during the life-time of both, (cherai hidop).\n\n(1) vide App. I. Sayings XLVII, XLVIII.\n(2) vide App. I. Saying XXXVI.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 56, 1910,\nOn the dissolution of marriage by death the burial expenses are normally met from the earnings of married life. If the wife survive she must return to her mother-in-law the personal apparel (batang tuboh) of the deceased. Custom defines the batang tuboh as one pair of trousers, one coat, one sarong, one kris, one sword, one dagger, one gun, and one handkerchief: but practice confines it to the actual clothing of the deceased.\n\nOn remarriage the woman sends back to the family of her dead husband, the actual pillows and mattress of their bridal bed. (tikar bantal).\n\nDivorce during life-time as practised in Rembau is of three kinds:\n\nI. The divorce at the instance of the man.\n\nAny, or no cause may theoretically be given by the husband for divorce. The announcement need not be made in the presence of witnesses, and notification by letter is valid. Normally the man informs some male relative of the wife of his intention to divorce and pays 15 cents as a fee of parting (timbang kasudahan). If he desire to express dissatisfaction with the treatment received at his wife\u2019s hands, he pays two cents only. At any time within the period of purification following divorce (edah) he may resume cohabitation, (merujok) or his wife may without prejudice to her modesty, invite him to return (jeput).\n\nII. The divorce by redemption at the instance of the wife (tebus talak).\n\nA woman can divorce her husband only if he consent to be bought out of his marital rights. In Rembau, the man fixes the price, and may demand any reasonable sum. Custom prescribes no redemption price for divorce by redemption owes its validity not to custom, but to acceptance of Mohamedan legal practice.\n\n(1) In the Kel\u00e9mak Kathiship of Naning the price has been fixed by convention at $100.\nIII. The order for separation (Pasah).\n\nTo obtain separation a wife must prove desertion, or lack of maintenance. Cruelty or adultery of the husband will not support a claim to separation. But the absence of the husband for six months on land or a year at sea, even if the wife has been granted ample support meanwhile, is a valid ground for separation, for maintenance includes not only monetary support (nafkah dlahir) but also conjugal rights (nafkah batin).\n\nNo woman convicted of adultery, even if abandoned by her husband to destitution, can obtain a separation order. Unless her husband divorce her of his own free will, she remains nominally his wife, so long as he lives.\n\nAgain, if the judge to whom a woman applies for an order of separation\u2014formerly the Undang, in later times the Kathi\u2014suspect any ulterior motive in her request from a desire to conceal criminal pregnancy or the expulsive power of a new affection, it is his duty to refuse her an order.\n\nThe order for pasah is the relief granted judicially to a wife who can endure desertion no longer. It is therefore to be distinguished from the registration of the fact that the divorce latent in a marriage of convenience (nikah ta'alik) has ripened. In that even the woman is concerned merely to establish before a registrar the fact that the prescribed period of absence has elapsed, her motives in asking for registration are irrelevant. The Kathi, whose office combines under existing conditions the duties of registrar and divorce judge, is apt to treat a request for registration of the automatic divorce as an application for a separation order. Yet, by insisting on an enquiry into the reasons prompting a request to register the termination of a marriage with a condition, the Kathi defeats the intention to which that form of marriage owes its existence.\n\nIf a divorced wife contracts a marriage before the 100 days of purification (edah) have elapsed she is liable to her former mother-in-law for a payment of 20 rupia ($7.20) as the escort of the bridal bed (permiring tikar bantal) of her divorced husband.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 56, 1910.\nThe customary rules regulating the division of property on divorce are four: of which the three latter explain the first.\n\n1. On separation divide, while together share alike.\n2. Joint earnings are divided.\n3. The separate estate of the wife remains with her.\n4. Property brought is returned to the bringer.\n\nRule I. Division of property must be made before, or at the moment of the divorce. If a man divorces his wife without demanding a division of property, he loses all claim to the share to which custom entitles him; but once a division has been made it holds good, even if cohabitation is resumed before the divorce becomes final. The division must be made in the presence of the elder or tribal chief. Hence, a man divorcing his wife by letter, forfeits his share of the marriage earnings.\n\nRule II. As married life may result either in loss or gain, the earnings include debts as well as assets. Modern usage tends to overlook this fact. But on a division of property at divorce a wife is entitled to apply any acquired asset to reimbursing herself for debts of her husband which she has met; and it is unquestionable that her separate estate is liable for one half of all debts incurred by her husband during marriage that remain still outstanding on divorce.\n\nException to Rule II. The rule as to the division between husband and wife of the joint earnings of married life, (charian laki-bini,) is subject to several important qualifications.\n\nIf there be issue of the marriage, the joint earnings are not divided, but are retained by the wife to support the issue. The husband takes away with him his personal apparel only as his share. The right of a widow with children to the earnings is specifically laid down by custom. The widow is therefore the proper person to administer, under present legal practice, the personal estate of her deceased husband.\n\n(1) vide App. I. Saying XL.\nAgain, the rule directs that the earnings be shared, but not that the two shares be equal. The equal right of husband and wife to earnings terminates with the marriage. The validity of a claim by either party on divorce to any given item of the acquired property depends on the nature of that item. Custom excludes certain kinds of property from the division. A woman's claim to the house her husband has built for her, to all improvements to ancestral land, and to jewelry and clothing bought her, is indefensible. The husband can claim no share in respect of such possessions, but has, on his part, the sole right to male ornaments and clothes, to weapons and fire-arms purchased during marriage.\n\nThe right of the mother to the custody of the children on divorce, is based on a similar convention. Custom regards the children as a class of marriage earnings but as a class wherein the principle of sharing on divorce is inoperative.\n\nLastly, on the dissolution of marriage by the death of either party, the survivor, after meeting the burial expenses, is entitled, if childless, to retain a sum equal to the cost of the funeral, to provide for his or her own burial, before sharing the balance of the earnings with the family of the deceased.\n\nSubject to these qualifications the rule of sharing on divorce the property acquired during marriage is absolute, except in the case of the parties to a marriage by agreement, (nikah ta'alik), when the husband can enforce no division. Even on a divorce obtained by the woman for lack of conjugal rights, she is entitled to her share of the earnings. Nor is her share diminished by her misconduct, should a man divorce his wife for adultery. As an outraged husband may refuse to divorce his wife, the possibility of a claim to a division of property being proffered rests with him; if he elect to divorce, he must abide by the consequences of his action.\n\n(1) vide case of Sohor Suku Batu Hampar Baroh decided 1907, who sold up pencharian, and appropriated the entire proceeds after divorcing his wife convicted in a court of law of adultery. Lower court's order for division of property upheld by judicial commissioner on appeal.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 56, 1910.\nRule III.\n\nAt no time does the husband acquire any rights over the separate estate of the wife. Hence even if the value of that property be enhanced by improvements he has made, by additions to the house, or by trees planted in the kampong the wife resumes sole interest therein on divorce.\n\nRule IV.\n\nThe claim of the husband, or should he be dead, of his family, to effects brought by him to his wife's home, is sustainable on divorce only if such property was duly declared by him at the time of marriage. His family seldom find it an easy matter to recover their property in cash which the husband was permitted to remove. The wife naturally alleges that it was all spent long ago in bringing up the children. But if the man's family can point to the wife's investment in mortgaged lands or buffaloes, their claim to recover by sale is valid.\n\nOn divorce the man returns to care of his mother's family.\n\nAfter the divorce or death of his wife, his mother's family resume responsibility for a man, and are entitled to profit by his subsequent acquisitions until he re-marries. Even if he elect to live as a widower with his children in their mother's house, his sisters and not his children succeed to any property he leaves at death, if an indisputable offer of a home has been made to him by his mother's family. His refusal of that offer does not extinguish the right of the sisters to inherit his estate, but they are liable, on succession, to pay or refund the cost of their brother's funeral.\n\nCustomary theory of marriage.\n\nIt remains to discover from the practice of marriage and divorce in Rembau, the customary theory of marriage. In what light did the Adat regard marriage?\n\nA modern enquirer into the attitude of the custom towards marriage finds his search confused by the induction on ancient pre-Mohamedan usage of the ideas and practice of Islamic law. Under the Hukum Shara,\u2014at least under the Sunni law\u2014marriage is a contract between individuals requiring attestation by competent witnesses, and validated for the woman, by her wali, or natural protector. In Rembau, as a professedly Mohamedan State, this form is observed, but cloaks a widely different conception.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nThe divergent theories underlying the two systems are apparent from examination of the position which the *wali* holds in Rembau. Under Mohamedan law the natural *wali* of the bride is her father or grand-father. In default of these she must fall back on the representative of civil law. His individual interest in the woman as his own offspring is the sanction of the natural *wali*. In Rembau, and generally throughout the Peninsula, the position of *wali* is not restricted to the father. An uncle or a brother is competent to give away his niece or sister in marriage. But in Rembau the normal competency of the uncle is subject to one luminous exception. The children of two brothers, who have married into different tribes, do not marry, though such an union does not violate the exogamic rule\u2014because, to Rembau ideas the uncle is debarred from exercising at such a marriage his right to act as *wali* to his niece. His competency in such circumstances is quashed (*batal wali*), for in Rembau his individual relationship to the bride, whence the *wali* derives his competency, is qualified by his status as member of a tribe.\n\nA concrete case will give the best illustration of this point.\n\nA and B, two brothers, marry, the elder into the Mungkar, the younger into the Tanah Datar tribe. A, as allied to the Mungkar tribe during his married life, is competent to protect the interests of Z, his Mungkar daughter. B\u2019s tribal interests are not, theoretically, so opposed to his instincts of kin as to incapacitate him from taking his brother\u2019s place as *wali*, should A have died before the proposed marriage of Z to X, a man of the Batu Belang tribe. But the tribal interests of B do clash with his duties as protector of his Mungkar niece, if he sanction her marriage with a member of the Tanah Datar tribe, to which his own wedding has allied him.\n\nAgain, the Malay treatise quoted\\(^1\\) shows that with the acceptance of the marriage fee a regular marriage is practically concluded. Whether or not this fee\u2014a payment alien to\n\n---\n\n(1) vide pp. 79 and 80.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 56, 1910.\nMohamedan marriage law\u2014is a survival of the purchase price of a bride in savage society, the nature of the fee has been wholly transformed by its retention in the customs of the matriarchal state of Rembau.\n\nRegarded from the standpoint of the payer\u2014the man who fills the customary debt, (mengisi adat), the marriage fee, as being a debt-of-inheritance, and a valid charge on the ancestral property of his family, is a tribal payment. The spread of Mohamedan ideas has taught the woman to account the fee her perquisite. Strict custom did not regard it in that light. The allocation of a portion of the fee payable for an irregular marriage, to the tribal chief and officers can only mean that the fee was also a tribal receipt. Thus the marriage fee\u2014the most essential item in customary marriage practice\u2014is neither given nor accepted by an individual, but by a tribe.\n\nTo custom then, marriage did not mean a contract between individuals, but was an institution affecting primarily the tribe.\n\nIs marriage under Rembau custom then, to be regarded as essentially a contract or alliance between two exogamic units?\n\nThis hypothesis will see in the ancestral property of the wife, and in the property brought with him by the husband, the contributions of either tribe, to be held in trust during the continuance of the alliance. It will class as the chief terms of the alliance, the common right of both parties to a marriage to the use of this property, the division of acquired property\u2014the profits of the alliance; and the withdrawal by either party of the original contributions, on the dissolution of the alliance by divorce or death.\n\nYet, formally plausible as is this hypothesis, it gives only a partial explanation of Rembau marriage practice, and it ignores one essential condition of married life under the Adat. In the normal event of issue by the marriage, the husband\u2019s tribe does not share in the \u201cprofits of the alliance,\u201d while the fruit of the union belongs to the woman\u2019s tribe. The most\nfortunate outcome of such a marriage leaves the man's tribe exactly where it stood before alliance was contracted, and the bachelor earnings of the husband may have passed to the wife's tribe. A married man, by the fact of his marriage, is severed from his own tribe, which has no claims on him and no obligations towards him except in regard to \"life and blood,\" so long as his married life continues. Such practice is a travesty of a tribal alliance.\n\nTo the wife's tribe alone a successful marriage brings certain gain; and this is the result which all Rembau marriage custom tends to foster. The life of a tribe depends on the acquisition and retention of property in members, lands, and goods. In the eyes of custom marriage is simply an institution providing the readiest means of sustaining tribal life by the acceptance from without the woman's tribe of further property, immediately, in the person of the husband, potentially, in his progeny and acquisitions.\n\nThis view explains the insistence of the custom on monogamy. The husband's position in his wife's tribe is based on his possibilities as a wealth-producer. As custom denies him two wives in one tribe, a second marriage destroys half his value as a tribal asset. Not all the laws of Islam, nor the ridicule of Rajas are strong enough to induce Rembau to admit a practice striking at the root idea of marriage, as understood by custom.\n\nThe very entrance of the husband into his wife's home is subject to his providing her tribe with a marriage fee, as earnest of his profit-bringing powers, and a check on their speedy diversion to another tribe's benefit. A woman's tribal chief may refuse to accept a suitor to her hand into his tribe, and it is generally, though unintelligently, held by present day lembagas that no debtor can marry the girl of his choice. Refusal to accept his marriage fee disposes of a suitor's chance.

(2) that the nature of the ceremonial observed at his funeral affords evidence of the status of the deceased chief: the only valid evidence, it may be, being a record of actual fact, obtainable in the not infrequent event of minor headmen laying claim to a higher rank than that they admittedly occupy.\n\n1. Ceremonial prescribed at the obsequies of the Undang (or of his wife, should she predecease him).\n\nA. Within the house.\n\n1. Curtains (labir) are hung on the wall.\n2. An awning (langit-langit) is stretched over the death-bed.\n3. The posts of the house are swathed in cloth.\n4. Eight cloths of gold thread, folded in triangular shape are hung on the walls of the death room, and eight in the verandah of the house.\n\nA salute of seven guns simultaneously is fired seven times.\n\nB. In the court-yard.\n\n1. Four naked straight bladed kris (kris panjang) are displayed.\n2. Four naked swords are thrust into the ground.\n3. Four naked spears with tufts of hair (tombak benderang) are set up.\n4. Four umbrellas are opened.\n5. Two each of the flags known as tunggul,\n6. merual,\n7. *ular-ular*,\n8. *pejar menyensing*, are unfurled.\n\nOn the display of these 24 insignia in the courtyard the chiefs meet to select a successor to the deceased:\n\nThe bier (*kainderaan*) is then brought, on which lies the three storied coffin made from a betel palm:\n\nWhen the body is deposited in the coffin,\n\n9. Four women take up their station beside it, bearing respectively, a water-jug (*kandil*), a set of *sireh* vessels (*chirana*), a flower-bowl, and a censer (*perasapan*), this ceremony is known as *Menialampai*:\n\n10. Four men scatter alms (*sed\u0113kah*) and beat gongs (*chanang*).\n\nThe performance of these eight duties completes the tale of the 32 prescribed ceremonies outside the house.\n\nA procession to the tomb is then formed and the coffin is borne over a path spread with white cloth:\n\nOn arrival at the tomb, all chiefs seat themselves on the ground and receive the alms (*sed\u0113kah*) to which their status entitles them, viz:\n\nto the VIII tribal chiefs (*lembaga yang d\u2019lapan*),\nto the V tribal chiefs in the lowland district,\nto the IV tribal chiefs in the up-land district,\nto the four members of the privy council of the Undang, whether present or not, 18 cents apiece;\nor, if their wives be present, 36 cents apiece.\nto tribal officers (*hulu-balang*) 12 cents apiece;\nor if their wives be present, 24 cents apiece.\n\nNo payment is made to the wives of chiefs unless present at the ceremony.\n\nAfter the payment of alms the coffin is placed in the tomb.\n\nII. Ceremonial prescribed at obsequies of the VIII tribal chiefs (*lembaga yang d\u2019lapan*)\n\nThe XII tribal chiefs: (*lembaga yang duabelas*)\nThe IV members of the privy council of the Undang (*orang besar kepada Undang*) or of their wives, should they predecease their husband:\u2014\nA. In the house.\n\nAs at the obsequies of the Undang, omitting\n1. the swathing of the posts in cloth,\n2. and eight of the folded cloths on the wall.\n\nB. In the court-yard.\n\nOne-half of the ceremonial prescribed for the Undang,\nomitting the beating of gongs.\n\nIn the case of chiefs of the upland district:\nno alms are scattered, and\nno cloth is spread on the path to the tomb.\n\nThe same alms are paid to chiefs as at the funeral of the\nUndang but no alms are forwarded to chiefs entitled thereto\nwho do not attend the ceremony.\n\nIII No special ceremonial is prescribed for the funeral of an\nelder, or tribal-officer, whose obsequies are those merely\nof the ordinary tribesman, excepting that the coffin is\nmade not of bamboos, as normally in Rembau, but of\na split betel palm.\nAPPENDIX VII.\n\nIni terasul b\u00ebrchakapan orang pinang m\u00ebminang.

George Frederick Hose, D.D.\n\nBishop of Singapore and Sarawak, 1881-1908.\n\nWith portrait.\n\nBishop Hose was born in 1838 (September 3rd) and was educated privately and at St. John's College Cambridge. He held the Curacy of Roxton, Beds., 1861-1865, and was ordained Priest in 1863. He was at first curate of Holy Trinity, Marylebone 1865-1868, and married Emily, daughter of J. Kirby, R. C. S., H. E. I. C., in 1867. He became Chaplain of Malacca in 1868 till 1873, and Chaplain of Singapore in 1873, becoming Archdeacon of Singapore in 1874 till 1881. He was consecrated Bishop of Singapore, Labuan and Sarawak on Ascension Day, 1881, in Lambeth Palace Chapel by Archbishop Tait assisted by 7 other Bishops amongst whom was Bishop McDougall, the Pioneer Bishop of Sarawak, a contemporary of Sir James Brooke. He was the third Bishop of Sarawak and first of Singapore, and his jurisdiction comprised the Straits Settlements, Java, Labuan and North Borneo with spiritual superintendence over the English Congregations in the Malay Archipelago and Siam.\n\nThe Bishop at the time of his retirement in 1908 had thus been a Minister of the Church of England for nearly 50 years. He had served 40 years in the Far East, and for the last 27 years of that period as Bishop over a widely scattered and then little known area. Previous to his arrival as a Chaplain the Straits Settlements had been part of the See of Calcutta and the Bishop of Calcutta used to visit Singapore and Penang about once in 5 years. There were 3 Chaplains\u2014one at each station\u20143 churches, and practically no native congregations attached to the Church of England. The Cathedral Church in Singapore had then been recently completed (1861).\n\nJour. Straits Branch R. A. Soc., No. 57, 1910.\nThe service of Bishop Hose thus corresponded with the life of the Colony of the Straits Settlements as a Colony instead of an Indian Dependency. He saw several generations of Governors and Officials come and go, and witnessed the rapid expansion of the Native States of the Malay Peninsula under British guidance, the rise and progress of British expansion in North Borneo, and the ever increasing prosperity of Sarawak in the hands of the Brooke family.\n\nWith this gradual expansion came increasing labours, and increasing responsibilities for the Bishop, and as time went on it became more and more apparent that it was not possible to combine missionary duties in Borneo with the efficient discharge of the duties of an Anglican Bishop in Malaya.\n\nThe division of the Diocese so strongly urged by the Bishop himself has already been carried out and the first Bishop of Singapore and Sarawak is thus also the last.\n\nThe life of the Bishop as Chaplain in Malacca during his first 5 years of Eastern service was uneventful. It was there that he commenced his studies in Eastern botany and the Malay language which continued to be a lasting interest to him throughout his career. His contributions to our Botanical knowledge have been considerable and will be separately noticed. As a Malay scholar he was not only able to serve the Church by translations of the Scriptures but also the whole community by founding (November 1877) the Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society for the promotion of interest in the science and literatures of Malaya.\n\nAs its Founder and President, Bishop Hose has taken a warm interest in the Society for nearly 30 years. He has been in touch with all that is best in the life and thought of Malaya for this long period and will be remembered with affection and respect.\n\nTo those who knew him, the departure of Bishop Hose is a personal loss. He was of a retiring disposition, but his broad-minded views, and Christian charity, and his fund of reminiscences of the old times made him a delightful companion. Not only will be be long remembered by the Church, and by the\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nEuropean Community of the Straits, but also by Christians in many remote Mission Stations on the rivers of Sarawak, and in the principal stations of British North Borneo.\n\nThis note cannot conclude without reference to the memory of Mrs. Hose, who is buried in Sarawak, and who for over 30 years set a high example of courage and devotion to every Christian woman in the Far East.\n\nR. N. Bland.\n\n15th February, 1909.\n\nAs stated in the note above by Mr. Bland, Bishop Hose was the Founder of the Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society on Nov. 4, 1877, and was elected its first president in 1878. He remained as President being annually re-elected till his retirement from the East.\n\nAs President in 1878 he delivered an inaugural address embodying the aims and objects of the Society and suggesting the lines on which the members should carry out the work of investigating and recording the unknown facts and history of the Malay Peninsula, and the ideas suggested by him have been carried out to a very large extent. The original members of the Society were ten in number, of whom the only remaining ones are the Bishop (then the Venerable Archdeacon G. F. Hose) and Mr. D. F. A. Hervey, who are both life members. The Bishop delivered two more Presidential addresses in 1879 and 1880, and also published in the Journal an account of the Ruins of Buro Budur, a catalogue of the ferns of Borneo, a list of ferns of Penrissen in Borneo and an account of the contents of a Dyak medicine chest.\n\nThe ferns of Borneo and of the Malay Peninsula had always a great attraction for him, and during his missionary travels he succeeded in making an extensive collection of these plants and adding a great deal to our knowledge of them. He freely distributed specimens to various Museums and a very complete series is preserved in the herbarium of the Singapore Botanic Gardens. Many of the new species discovered by him were described by Mr. Baker of the Royal Gardens, Kew,\nand many species, e.g., *Trichomanes Hosei*, *Davallia Hosei*, *Adiantum Hosei* *Nephrodium Hosei*, *Meniscium Hosei* and *Hemionitis Hosei* were associated with his name. His own private collection of specimens was unfortunately completely destroyed by an invasion of termites into the Cabinets in which they were preserved during his absence on leave.\n\nHe did not however confine his interest exclusively to Ferns, and towards the close of his stay in the East devoted some of his leisure to the collection and study of grasses and sedges of Borneo in which research he was assisted by his daughter Miss Hose. He added too to our knowledge of other groups of plants, as is shown by the names of *Dendrobium Hosei* and the beautiful climber *Hosea Lobbiana* which also commemorate his services to botany.\n\nHis small garden at Kuching in Sarawak contained many interesting and beautiful plants which he had brought from the Borneo forests and successfully cultivated and we are indebted to him for the beautiful *Crinum Northianum* only known from a drawing at Kew by Miss North, till on its rediscovery in Sarawak, the Bishop sent living bulbs to the Singapore gardens, whence it has been distributed to many other parts of the world. He introduced to cultivation too the *Hosea*, *Pinanga arundinacea* an elegant and rare dwarf palm and many orchids and other plants. Into Sarawak he introduced beside many ornamental plants the first plants of the Para rubber tree from Singapore seed, some of which are still in the garden at Kuching. He retired from the East early in 1908 and all will hope he may live many years to enjoy his well-earned rest.\n\nThe portrait we give is by Wilson of Singapore, a large sized copy of which by the same photographer was presented to the Society by Dr. Galloway and hangs on the walls of the Society's Library.\n\nH. N. RIDLEY.\nA Scientific Expedition to Temengoh,\nUpper Perak.\n\nBy H. N. Ridley, M.A., F.R.S., F.L.S.\n\nIn the month of July 1909, an expedition to investigate the fauna and flora of Temengoh in Upper Perak, a district unknown botanically and zoologically, left Kuala Kangsar on the 4th of the month. The party consisted of Mr. H. C. Robinson, C. B. Kloss and myself, with a number of Dyak collectors, the plant collector Amat, and servants. The heavy baggage and natives started on ahead on the previous evening. Travelling in gharries we arrived at the pretty village of Lenggong at midday. On the way we passed through a village where a Malay wedding was about to be celebrated, and found some stir had been caused by a small boy having being bitten on the arm below the shoulder by the poisonous snake *Doliophis bivirgatus*. The boy was sick and crying, but apparently more from fright than from injury caused by the reptile, as he showed no signs of the effects of snake poison, although it was some time after the animal had bitten him; we could but administer some whisky as all drugs suitable were in the baggage carts, which had gone on ahead. This handsome snake has certainly the reputation of being deadly but though the mark of the bite was visible, the boy did not seem to be in any danger of life. A little further on a herd of wild pigs was seen in the ricefields by the road. After arriving at Lenggong, 32 miles, we strolled to some limestone cliffs a mile or two further on and I collected a few plants of interest. *Colocasia gigantea* was common. The pretty azure blue *Chirita caliginosa* was nearly out of flower. *Plectranthus Kunstleri* too was abundant. We had not time for much collecting here, then, but on the return journey the plant collector in a few hours made a grand haul of new and rare plants. The beautiful Chestnut swallow *Hirundo badia* was observed dashing about near the cliffs in\n\nJour. Straits Branch R. A. Soc., No. 57, 1910.\nsome abundance. On the following day we continued to travel in the gharries and arrived at Grit in the afternoon $43\\frac{1}{2}$ miles. Part of the road traversed some fine forest in which the tall bamboo *Dendrocalamus pendulus* was conspicuous: it is indeed very abundant all over this part of Upper Perak. The climbing bamboo *Dinochloa tjankorreka* was also seen in full flower. On our arrival we took up our abode in the resthouse.\n\nGrit is a rather picturesque village which was formerly more prosperous but as the tin-mining industry in the neighbourhood died away the village got poorer and many of the houses were empty at the time our visit. A number of fine trees of the Tualang, *Abauria parvifolia* formed a very conspicuous feature of the village. Mr. Berkeley, the District Officer, showed us a fine lot of cattle and sheep belonging to Government, and took us for a stroll round the village. In one garden was a hedge of *Acalypha fruticosa* cultivated by the Malays for a kind of tea made from the leaves. *Solanum involucratum* remarkable for its large calyx was common here. I had never previously met with it. It appears to be confined to the north of the Peninsula. The curious aquatic aroid *Cryptocoryne affinis* was plentiful in the gravelly bed of a stream; a number of plants in flower were collected here but unfortunately the presses containing them were left behind on the following day and remained so long before we obtained them again that the plants were all spoilt. With Mr. Berkeley\u2019s assistance we engaged eleven elephants to convey our baggage to Temengoh. The elephants were a source of much interest to the Dyaks who had not seen these animals before.\n\nOn July 5 we started off the elephants with all the baggage except one load and a half which was to have come on by other elephants next day, but which did not start till we were on the return journey. We started walking ourselves on the following day at 7.30 a.m. to Kuala Temengoh, 18 miles distant, of which most of the way was through forest, and overtook the elephants about four miles from our destination. The plant collector and I collected plants all the way and\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nobtained many interesting specimens. Shortly after leaving Grit I found the cream-white flowered orchid *Geodorum citrinum* in fine bloom and *Gastrochilus plicatus*, only previously known from a plant sent by Dr. Gimlette from Kelantan, was abundant. Shortly after crossing a small river, we found a bank covered with the Maidenhair fern *Adiantum lunulatum*, undoubtedly wild here, as there were no houses within a reasonable distance, and just as we came to the Perak river by Kuala Temengoh, one of the men found the first flower of the *Rafflesia* that I had ever seen fully opened and in good condition. It was bright red with raised whitish blotches, about eighteen inches across and exhaling a faint scent like that of *Amorphophallus*.\n\nWe stopped the night at the resthouse at Kuala Temengoh, a most picturesque spot with the two rivers meeting, and wooded hills on either side. Indian corn grew well in the sandy ground round the house, and we enjoyed a meal of it. The resthouse is a bamboo structure, unfurnished, overlooking the junction of the two rivers.\n\nEarly next morning July 8 we left for our walk to Temengoh and arrived there at about half past one, the elephants which started later getting there at about a quarter past three. The distance is about fourteen miles, a pleasant walk along the river bank, and on the way we found two species of *Begonia*, one with lanceolate leaves deep purple, plain or spotted with white, and small pink flowers; the other with plain green leaves and larger white flowers: *B. isoptera*, Dryand. was common all over this country also. A pretty *Biophytum* with white flowers and *Gastrochilus bilobus* with its fragrant white flowers also ornamented the banks. In the open fields cleared by old cultivation the big grass *Anthistiria gigantea* seemed to have largely replaced the Lalang which is so characteristic of such spots further south. The Lalang, it is true, did occur but was not very plentiful. The elephants seemed to appreciate the *Anthistiria* pulling it up by the roots and beating it against their legs before eating it. The track along the river was a good one where it had not been\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 57, 1910.\npounded about by the elephants for which in parts side tracks had been made, but the places where the beasts had stepped were full of holes containing foul water which never escaped. In one of these elephants' foot print puddles we on one occasion found a large water scorpion (*Belostoma*).\n\nThe house at Temengoh was a bamboo hut of fairly large size near the river bank and standing in old village ground with Limes, Guavas, Durians, and Sentol trees, growing around. Near the river bank was a very fine Kapayung tree, *Pangium edule*, Bl., bearing its curious fruits.\n\nOur arrival at the village seemed to cause some alarm, and the children refused to go to the school which was near the resthouse unless personally conducted by adults, nor were the adults much less nervous. There were a good many Semangs about and we constantly came to camps from which they had fled at our approach. On one of our walks through the ricefields Amat the plant collector and I met a Semang with a little child on the path. He stopped dead at the sight of us some forty yards away. We turned off the path to cross the fields and he began to sing, or utter some invocation in a very loud voice till he had passed the spot we had turned off when he broke into a run as hard as he could go yelling at the top of his voice. We managed to get several however to the resthouse where the other members of the party collected their language. We asked them what became of the dead, good and bad; one said the good went down stream, the bad up stream, asked who made the world they were quite unable to understand the question, apparently they did not see any reason why anyone should make it. They seemed to know nothing of any deities or spirits (hantus) and feared only the tiger, elephant, and falling trees, and apparently lightning. In camp on June 21, three men out of a travelling band of fifteen came to my hut, the others made a detour to avoid us. They had been further into the forest to visit another set who had some plantations, and were returning to Temengoh with food. Two were young fellows and one an old bald man with a single tuft of hair on his head, father of one of the younger ones. They had some\nsweet potatoes and a kind of travelling ration in the form of a cylinder of pounded tapioca made in a bamboo and looking like a pale colored German sausage. I tasted it and found it very uninteresting stuff, tasteless and woody. They are monogamous and seem prolific as the old man had eight children.\n\nAmat and I made excursions every day into the woods as far as possible and collected vigorously. The leeches were very troublesome, and extremely abundant, eventually several of the bites on my legs got poisoned and I was only able to walk with difficulty and much pain. There was much diarrhoea and fever also among the expedition. The latter was perhaps due to mica in the water which boiling did not get rid of. It would have been well to have filtered it also if possible. The whole of this region appears to be somewhat unhealthy. These ailments interfered considerably with collecting but we managed to get as good a series of the plants of the region as could have been expected. All the elephants of the country being required for the travels of Messrs. Birch and Berkeley we were unable to push as far as had been intended, there being no other means of transport. However we succeeded in obtaining the services of two coolies on one occasion, and with the help of some of the Dyaks, I, my boy, and Amat pushed up a day's march along the river but about midday it began to pour furiously with rain and having come to an old camping ground on the river bank, and the men being quite tired and all drenched, we stopped there and pitched camp in a furious down-pour. We had one or two water-proof cloths to make the hut with, but enlarged it by the use of the leafy stems of a ginger (Hornstedia), the only thing we could find at all suitable, and after some trouble got the roof water proof. There being no rattans here we used the bast of the Dedaup (Bauhinia integrifolia) for tying. We stopped here for six days, the Dyaks and coolies returning the second day, leaving Amat, my boy and myself alone. We collected as hard as we were able, pushing as far from camp as we could, but both of us were really too ill to do as much as we might have done. The best collecting was, as usual in these forests,\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 57, 1910.\nalong the banks of the river, which entailed wading the whole or nearly the whole time up the stony bed of a rapid stream, which was pretty hard work, as I was still very unwell and lame. Messrs Robinson and Kloss managed to get the loan of an elephant from the Menkong of the village to fetch me back to Temengoh. It arrived overnight and I rode back on it on June 27. By this time four bamboo rafts had been made for our return and we started in these for Kuala Temengoh on the 28th. There were few rapids on this part of the journey, the first being called \"Darat,\" as an Anak Darat (a chief's daughter) was said to have been drowned here by the overturning of a raft. It was a pleasant mode of travelling and very picturesque. Near Kuala Temengoh we saw fresh tracks of a herd of wild elephants. Stopped at one place by the blocking of the stream with an old raft, we had an opportunity of collecting the pretty orchid *Dendrobium hercoglossum* in full flower and some other plants. We arrived at Kuala Temengoh about midday. One of the men was very ill with fever and in a serious state. We eventually got him to the hospital at Grit where he died in a few days. In the afternoon Amat and I rambled round Kuala Temengoh and collected. Next day the rafts which had been enlarged and improved by the addition of a roof to keep off the sun and by fixing steering paddles at each end, started down the Perak river; the old man on our raft which went first hurled a quid of betel to the spirits of the river with an invocation as we entered the narrow water between the low black rocks which flank the stream. Mr. Birch has recently given in the journal an account of his passage through the falls on this route so there is no need for me to redescribe it. We got through without mishap of any kind. Shortly after we had started one of the coolies announced that he had seen the two elephants bringing up the remainder of our baggage left behind at Grit three weeks previously, in the village at Kuala Temengoh. By this time they had started for Temengoh, a quite useless journey now. As it had been considered unsafe to transmit our collections by raft to Grit, we had left them under charge of some\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nof the Dyaks in the hope that we might procure elephants at Grit and bring them overland. No elephants however were procurable and eventually the collections came down safely by raft. We stopped once or twice on the way down to collect plants and to lunch, but these rocks were surprisingly barren of anything but common weeds. The only rare plant we got was the curious creamy yellow flowered *Crotalaria chinensis*; This seems to be the only recorded locality for this plant in the Peninsula: at one spot the rocks were bright with some pink flower, and we stopped to see what it was, when it proved to be the common pink *Celosia argentea*, an ordinary waste ground plant. Here and there on the rocks were to be seen scarlet patches, occasionally partly bright yellow, which so resembled Chinese lettering that at first I thought they had been painted there by Chinese as a charm but they proved to be patches of a scarlet alga. Deer were said to be frequently seen on these rocks but we saw none, the only animals seen on the way were some common monkeys, and an otter swimming across the stream. All went well till we got beyond the rocks and to the broad part of the river when a deluge of rain came on and we had to stop for a time. Eventually it ceased and we arrived at Kuala Kenering in the evening. Here we left the baggage in a house with the men till next day, and ourselves proceeded to walk to Grit, 2\u00bd miles. We returned to Kuala Kangsar by gharry, the baggage travelling by oxcart. We spent one night at Lenggong, where the plant collector who had arrived previously made an excellent haul of plants from the limestone hills, and the bird collectors secured the lovely ant-thrush *Pitta boschii*. The full moon was most brilliant that night, and the wa-was (*Hylobates*) seemed to appreciate it, for they kept up a continual chorus from both sides of the valley throughout the night. We drove from Lenggong to Kuala Kangsar 35 miles in 4 hours and 40 minutes with the same ponies which had brought us from Grit, and then returned to Thaiping.\n\nThe management of the expedition was effected by Mr. Robinson and Mr. Kloss to whom I am much indebted for their invitation to join the expedition and much assistance during the trip.\n\nR.

It may be noted, however, that several species, which in Batang Padang and Selangor are rarely met with below 3000 feet occur at altitudes which do not exceed 1000 feet, a fact which may be due to the immediate proximity of large and lofty mountain masses.

The woodpecker Gecinulus viridis usually rather rare in Perak, though it occurs sparingly on the main range as far south as southern Selangor, wherever there is much bamboo, was not uncommon in Temengoh.\nTHE FLORA OF THE TEMENGOH DISTRICT.\n\nThe plants collected in this expedition were for the most part gathered in the immediate neighbourhood of Ulu Temengoh, round the village of that name on the banks of the Temengoh river, and on the track between Ulu Temengoh and Kuala Temengoh where the Temengoh and Perak rivers join. Others were obtained on the route from Grit to Kuala Temengoh, and at Grit itself. On the return journey additions were made to the collections along the banks of the Perak river on the rocks of the Perak river and at Kuala Kenering, near Grit, and the plant collector put in a few hours at Lenggong where the limestone rocks rich in the calcareous flora gave a good harvest. This district had never been previously submitted to botanical investigation except that Mr. L. Wray had obtained some plants at Kuala Kenering and near Kuala Temengoh, and had botanised on the Plus river, at no great distance from the Temengoh river.\n\nThe region after leaving the village of Grit was as usual a succession of forest-clad-hills, of no great altitude, and the track ran mainly along the Temengoh river, giving a succession of charming views. The soil in all this region was somewhat sandy which was perhaps the cause of the comparative scantiness of the flora, and many of the hills were clad in a bamboo forest which is most unsatisfactory for the botanist as this form of jungle like that of the Bertam forests (also not uncommon here,) is almost bare of any undergrowth flora, a few selaginellas and a Sonerila or two being the only plants in these dry spots. The cleared land round the Temengoh village produced the usual characteristic Malay campong flora, but with additions of plants less common in the south. Beneath the fruit trees grew abundantly Phrynium Jagoratum with its prettily striped leaves, and Tacca vespertilio, the curious fern Hemionitis and some other plants unusual to find in the Campong orchards.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nThe river where rocky produced several plants which I had previously met with far up the Pahang river, such as *Hygrophila saxatilis*, *Pentasacme caudata*, *Ixora stricta* narrow leaved variety, *Nauclea purpurascens* and other narrow leaved plants characteristic of the mountain torrent streams.\n\nConspicuous trees in the forests by the rivers were *Lagerstroemia floribunda*, *Pangium cedule*, and the beautiful *Engelhardtia* reminding one of an ash tree. *Millettia decipiens* with its white flowers, was also conspicuous.\n\nIn some parts of the forest, especially near old Semang clearings, were dense thickets of *Phaeomeria imperialis*, the cultivated variety with a white not yellow edge to the lip. It grew sometimes in immense abundance mixed with *Hornstedtia megalochilus* and *Amomum uliginosum*, and is no doubt introduced, being cultivated for its edible flower buds and fruits. *Zingiber spectabile* was very abundant and in splendid flower. In the more open woods *Didymocarpi* were poorly represented though what species there were were abundant. Among herbaceous plants the *Acanthaceae* were most abundant, and conspicuous. The sandy woods seemed to suit these plants very well. The most striking was a fine *Strobilanthes* with violet flowers. Orchids and indeed epiphytes generally were conspicuously scanty, in most of the woods and along the river bank. Perhaps the country was apt to get too dry for them. Palms too were by no means as abundant as one usually finds them in hillwoods, and did not as usual form an important feature in the landscape.\n\nI expected to find so far north the ricefield flora of the northern part of the peninsula but the rice cultivators had come from the south, and with them had come the southern ricefield weeds. The fields were often edged with the Willow *Salix tetrasperma*. As this is often used further south as a kind of hedging or fence for the fields it may owe its abundance in such spots to introduction.\n\nNear the village the little river known as Sungei Kertai runs into the Temengoh river and on one occasion the plant collector and I waded as far up the river or walked along the\nbanks as was possible in the day. The flora here was rather richer than along the Temengoh woods and the trees on the river bank and on the islets were more abundantly weeded with epiphytes. *Coelogyne aspera* was abundant here and in flower. It is a very widely distributed orchid over this region and in Sumatra, where I have seen in the river woods of Siak immense abundance, the clumps being so large that it was difficult to find any small enough for our dug-out to carry. Along the Kertai too we found the pretty *Leea simplicifolia* with its large leaves purple beneath, a most unvine-like tree vine.\n\n*Rafflesia* we found in flower in the woods at Kuala Temengoh and at the upper camp at Ulu Temengoh. I had never seen fully opened flowers of any species of *Rafflesia* before, though it appears to be common in some parts of Perak, the Malays collecting it for medicine. It is a most wonderful object with its bright red petals ornamented with irregular raised white bosses. The scent was not strong, a faint odour of *Amophophallus*, something like a decaying animal. Only two flowers were seen.\n\nFrom the Ulu Temengoh village I and Amat with a few carriers went a day further into the forest and camped for a few days in the hopes of finding a fresh type of flora, but there was little difference. The best collecting was done by wading up the river. There was very little to be found in the inner parts of the forest but the river edge was much more productive. The work of wading up these gravelly and stony rivers with a strong current is hard, but it is the most productive way of botanizing as these are more trees and shrubs in flower, overhanging the water. On the return journey we collected and examined the rocks of the Perak river below Kuala Temengoh, which however were very barren. The flora consists of many common weeds. *Merremia hastata* *Celosia cristata*, some common grasses and other weeds, *Utricularia bifida*, etc. The most interesting plants were *Crotalaria chinensis*, apparently its only known locality in the peninsula, and *Melothria heterophylla*, a weedy cucumber.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nThe most important discovery during the trip was a new species of the curious genus *Stichoneuron*, one of the *Roxburghiaceae*. The only species hitherto known is Himalayan, and this one is very distinct. The fruit of the genus has never been seen, though the type plant seems to be by no means rare in India. We were equally unsuccessful with the Temengoh species, abundant though it was on sandy banks by the Temengoh river.\n\nThe flora on the whole had the greatest affinity with that of Penang and the northern part of the peninsula while the river bank plants were more allied to those of Pahang on the East coast.\n\nAmong the new species there was noticed to be a tendency to increased hairiness, notably in *Costus velutinus* and *Cyrtandra barbata* and *rotundifolia*, *Didymocarpus crinita* was silkier than usual and *D. bombycinum* an allied species is also a hairy silky plant. The tendency may perhaps be connected with the sandy nature of the soil rendering it dryer than in most woods in dry weather.\n\nIn the list of plants which follows I have inserted a revision of the Melastomaceous section *Oxysporeae* which seem to have been much confused.\nLIST OF PLANTS.\n\nRANUNCULACEAE.\n\n*Naravelia laurifolia*, Wall.

A Soc., No. 57, 1910.\nFlacourtia Rukam, var. Ulu Temengoh near the village.\n\nThe Flacourtias known here as Rukam, seem to be in a very confused state botanically, and require more study from the living plants. Most of those in this region are only known in a cultivated or semicultivated state. They can be separated into two groups according to whether the styles are separated to the base or whether they are connate, with little more than the stigmas free. Three species are recorded from the Malay peninsula, viz., F. Rukam, Zoll. Mor., F. inermis, Roxb., and F. Cataphracta, Bl.\n\nThe first of these has free styles, the other two connate styles.\n\nF. Rukam, Zoll. is described as an unarmed tree, but this, if my identification is correct, is not always the case. There seem however to be several forms of it. In one form the leaves are small and the tree is quite unarmed. The fruit has 6 to 8 styles quite free and widely separate on a flat top to the fruit. This is the species mentioned above and I have only seen it in villages. A specimen sent to Dr. King many years ago was named F. Roxburghii, but I cannot find this name taken up anywhere. Another form is a straggling thorny tree with large leaves, and is the only really wild species in the peninsula, inhabiting damp forests.\n\nThis form of F. Rukam, has large elliptic cuspidate leaves, 6-7 inches long 2\u00bd inches wide, the cusp an inch long. The margin of the leaf strongly crenulate, and altogether glabrous. The flowers are unisexual in small tufts but more numerous than in F. cataphracta. The pedicels are pubescent. Sepals and disc as in F. cataphracta. The sepals ovate obtuse pubescent. Stamens numerous. In the female the styles are separate stout and spreading. The fruit is rather larger, and the styles slender quite separate and remote on the flattened top.\nThis plant is common in the Singapore woods at Chua Chu Kang, Bukit Timah (8398), Kranji (6388), Stagmount (14144), Changi (3603.) Also I have met with it in Johor at Tebing Tinggi and Kuala Sembrong (Kelsall.)\n\nA very similar plant with fewer nerves and more glabrous flowers was collected by Dr. Haviland (973) at Kuching. It also occurs at in Perak at Tapa (Wray 1329); Pekan, Goping in Perak (Kunstler 4718); Penang (Curtis 1566). Another form has usually smaller leaves and is pubescent on the branches petioles and veins on the back of the leaf, and this I have only seen in villages. I have it from a cultivated plant quite thornless (11366, 468); Perak, Thaiping (Wray 2399, Kunstler 2858); Krian, (Wray) and Simpang, (Wray 2041); Malacca, Ayer Bumban (Cantley), Bukit Bruang (R. Derry 1200), and this is the Temengoh plant.\n\nThese two forms may not be even varietally different, but are I think worth noting.\n\n*F. inermis*, Roxb., has hermaphrodite flowers, no thorns and an acid fruit, Jack records it and describes it from Penang. The styles are free. A plant with rather thin large leaves from the Penang gardens collected by Mr. Curtis and by him named *F. inermis*, has the styles connate something like those of *F. Calaphracta*, but it is not that species. I have only seen fruit of it.\n\n*F. Cataphracta*, Bl. Is a thorny tree with branched thorns on the trunk and straight species on the young-shoots from the stool. The branches are not spiny, and trees can often be met with few or no spines anywhere. The leaves are small, lanceolate acuminate with entire edges or more often shortly crenulate denticulate dark shining green, red when first appearing. The flowers are unisexual in small axillary tufts.\nThey have small imbricate sepals, hairy on the edge, ovate green. The males have a number of yellow stamens surrounded at the base by a yellow ring shaped disc. The female flowers have sepals and disc as in the male, but instead of the stamens a flask shaped pistil, the style cylindric red stout, and 4 connate styles, free only at the tip, with capitate stigmas. The fruit is globose and about as big as a twelve-bore bullet, dark brown red, the colour of a red gooseberry with a quantity of greenish yellow pulp surrounded 4 or 5 flat seeds.\n\nThis is the best of the eating Rukams. The fruit when gathered is very astringent and firm in texture, but after rolling it about in the hands it becomes soft and sweet, all astringency disappearing. It occurs in villages all over the peninsula.\n\n**Ternstroemiaceae.**\n\n*Sarauja nudiflora*, De C. Temengoh.\n\n*S. tristyla*, De C.

Common, Temengoh.\n\n**OXYSPORA AND ALLOMORPHIA.**\n\nThese two genera are undoubtedly closely allied, though the original types of the two viz. *Oxyspora paniculata*, De C. and *Allomorphia exigua*, Bl. are plants of very different appearance. Cogniaux in his monograph of *Melastomaceae* (Decandolle's Prodromus continuation) separates the two genera according to the anthers whether they are all similar as in *Allomorphia* or dissimilar (*Oxyspora*). King in the Materials writes that this character breaks down in two species which he describes, *O. acutangula*, and *O. Curtisi* and modifies the general character of *Oxyspora*, which depends he says on its open paniculate inflorescence and long double fusiform boldly ridged capsules, white *Allomorphia* is characterised by its shortly branched panicles on the ultimate branchlets of which the flowers are collected in pseudo-gloemeruli while the capsules are not much longer than broad and are often urn-shaped.\n\nThis arrangement seems to me to make matters worse, e.g., *Allomorphia capillaris* has the panicles diffuse and open, with the stamens and fruit of *Allomorphia*, while *A. Curtisi* has everything required for the genus *Allomophia* as originally laid down, except\nthe capsule which is long and ribbed like that of *Oxyspora*. The only really tangible character for *Oxyspora* is the dissimilarity of the anthers, which is usually accompanied by the elongate capsule. But for this it would be better to amalgamate the two genera. Under *Anerincleistus* Dr. King placed two plants with large spreading terminal panicles, though the genus is usually diagnosed by its possessing axillary inflorescences of small size. Of one of these *Anerincleistus floribundus*, King., a common plant on the Taiping hills, I sent many years ago a specimen in to M. Cogniaux who named it *Oxyspora macrophylla* Triana, originally described from Sumatra, and it certainly possesses all the characters of an *Oxyspora*. This genus *Anerincleistus* also as laid down in King\u2019s Materials and perhaps too in Cogniaux contains a mixture of very dissimilar plants, and these had better be rearranged also.\n\n**OXYSPORA.**\n\nThe original characteristic of the genus *Oxyspora* was the dissimilarity in the eight stamens, 4 of which were longer and of different shape from the other four, but as there is also another distinctive character in the original species viz, the fusiform capsule, King seems to have disregarded the inequality of the stamens and used the latter character only, adding to the normal *O. steilulata*, *O. acutangula* and *O. Curtisii* both of which have similar stamens. Baillon combined the genus with *Allomorphia*.\n\nI would propose to retain for *Oxyspora* all the species with terminal panicles and eight stamens of which four are distinctly dissimilar from the others.\n\nThe following would then be the species of this genus as known to me:\u2014\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 57, 1910.\nO. cernua, Triana. Assam.\nO. paniculata, De C. India.\nO. vagans, Wall. Assam.\nO. hispida, Ridl. Selangor.\nO. microcarpa, Ridl.\nO. rosea, Ridl.

Sumatra.\n\nOf these the ones with fusiform capsules are O. cernua, O. paniculata, O. vagans, O. rosea and O. stellulata, King. O. hispida and O. microcarpa have capsules rather of the nature of those of Anerinicleistus, and O. longifolia Ridl., though in other respects closely allied to O. rosea, has exactly the capsules of Allomorphia exigua, but the distinctly unequal stamens of O. rosea.\n\nO. hispida, n. sp.\n\nShrub, stems densely covered with processes, reddish cylindric acuminate. Leaves opposite equal ovate acuminate base cordate, the lobes meeting above sprinkled with conic papillae especially on the midrib and margins, beneath paler more densely covered, nerves two pairs, lower pair from the base, the other from the midrib half an inch higher, reticulations elevate on the back, blade 5 inches long 3 inches wide, petiole densely hairy stout, 1\u00bd inch long.

The ovary in flower tapers downwards into the pedicel and is something of the shape of that of a typical oxyspora, but in fruit actually urn-shaped.\n\nIt is nearest to *O. stellulata*, King and resembles *O. paniculata* De C. in indumentum.\n\n*O. rosea* Ridl. *Allomorphia rosea*, Ridl. Trans. Linn. Soc. Ser. II. III. 301.\n\nThis plant is certainly an *Oxyspora*. It is quite omitted from the Materials by King, as is almost every species described in the above paper. It is a low shrub almost completely glabrous, except for scurfy papillae all over the young parts, stem, petioles, inflorescence and ovary. The leaves are large, 12 to 18 inches long, with a pair of nerves, very slender running along the edge and close to it and rising from the base, a pair of nerves rising from the midrib half an inch from the base and running to the apex, parallel with the outer ones and half an inch from them, the transverse nervules about 22 pairs horizontal raised on both surfaces.

Beccariana probably not Allomorphia, and A. Griffithii, Hook, and A. hispida, Kurz. The former certainly and the latter probably also Phyllagathis. A. multilineura of Borneo possibly the same and the section Hollbrungrophyta of New Guinea with pentamerous flowers may safely be excluded, and A. ovalifolia, Tri, of Vitu.\n\nAllomorphia. The type of this is Allomorphia exigua, Bl. A tall half shrubby plant with small greenish or white flowers, common in the low country, in shady woods. The leaves are large ovate 10 inches long, 6 inches wide glabrous, the stem is hollow and terete. The panicle 6 inches or more long, much branched terminal with very many small yellowish green or almost white flowers. The ovary at first goblet-shaped with short triangular sepals. Petals small oblong ovate. Stamens equal, little curved cylindric obtuse, base distinctly prolonged. In fruiting the ovary becomes urn-shaped narrowed at the top below the sepaline ring, and has eight raised ribs.\n\nThe plant is common in the peninsula, Malacca, at the base of Mt.

(Materials l. c. p. 12) is most nearly allied to A. exigua Bl., resembling it in the form and colouring of the flowers and the form of the fruit but the stem and branches are winged with a low thin ridge, and are angled. The rachis of the inflorescence is also winged and angled. It varies in size apparently according to locality. On the banks of the Tapah river, and such localities it is dwarf with smaller leaves. In the forests it is taller with leaves often as big as those of A. exigua, but it is not altogether so big a plant.\n\nIt occurs in Selangor, Bukit Hitam (Kelsall); Perak, Larut Hills (Ridley 11435, Curtis 2008, 3719, King\u2019s coll. 2041); Bujong Malacca (Ridley 9607), Tapah (14101); Telom.

Straits Branch\nPenang Hill (Curtis 73), (Ridley 5239); Dindings woods near Bruas (Ridley 8364); Perak, Waterloo estate (Ridley 2946); Temengoh Woods (Ridley).\n\nThis plant is somewhat variable, and different forms look often very distinct, this however I believe is rather due to locality than to actual varietal difference. The Penang Hill plant is a short plant with short inflorescences. It grows abundantly on the rocky banks on the road to the waterfall. In the Dindings and Waterloo estate woods the panicle is longer and quite capillary and it was from these specimens that Cogniaux gave his manuscript name. At Temengoh we got two forms in one of which the panicle is much branched with distinct slender capillary branches. It is totally different from *A. exigua*, Bl., and in life the bright rose pink stamens and white petals are so conspicuous that no one would take it for the coarse tall green-flowered *A. exigua*, Bl.\n\n*A. porphyranthera*, n. sp.\n\nShrub, branches slender angled dark colored covered with short scabrous red papillae. Leaves opposite equal elliptic, or elliptic lanceolate acuminate above glabrous except for red scurf on the midrib, beneath nerves and nervules red scurfy, 5 inches long, 2 inches wide or less; petiole slender grooved scurfy 1 inch long. Inflorescence terminal 2-2\u00bd inches long, a lax panicle of 5 to 7 branches, 1-1\u00bd inch long with dense cymes of few flowers on the ends, all scurfy. Bracts linear \u00bc inch long. Ovary longer than broad goblet-shaped scabrid. Calyx lobes triangular acute almost mucronate short. Petals lanceolate acuminate as long as the filaments. Stamens 8 all similar, filaments short, anthers \u00bc inch long, blue purple, cylindric acuminate straight, base shortly prolonged but no dorsal process. Style filiform, a little longer. Capsule obovoid urn-shaped glabrous with eight ribs. Woods, Ulu Temengoh.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 57, 1910.\nThe capsules are subumbellate and much resemble those of *A. exigua* Bl.\n\n*A. Curtisii*, Ridl. *Oxyspora Curtisii*, King. Materials.\n\nA single specimen of this plant was found by Mr. Curtis on the Hermitage hill in Perak, No. 1300 of his collection. It was referred to *Oxyspora* by King on account of its fusiform fruit. In its herbaceous habit, and the similar stamens resembling those of *Allomorphia*. I should prefer to retain it on that genus. The flowers are larger than in most *Allomorphias* and the stamens rather longer. The fruit however is hardly that of *Oxyspora*. It is not simply goblet shaped, but elongate elliptic narrowed above and below and ribbed; certainly different in form from any of this section that I know, but rather suggesting a drawn out capsule of *Allomorphia*.\n\n**Campimia n. gen.**\n\nA shrubby plant with a hollow woody stem, leaves opposite equal ovate long petioled. Inflorescence axillary shorter than the leaves, scorpioid, the flowers small on distinct articulations. Calyx tube campanulate hardly lobed, truncate. Petals 4.

Stapf's *Dreissena Scorpioidea* differs from other species of the genus in its scorpioid inflorescence and from *Dreissena* in having only one appendage to the stamens instead of two.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nC. *Wrayi*, Ridl. This plant is peculiar in having the inflorescences axillary as well as terminal. The habit of the plant is somewhat that of *A. exigua*, Bl. The stem more woody and hollow. The leaves ovate to nearly orbicular, with the petioles curiously margined with cylindric acuminate hairs. The panicles are many flowered, sometimes with rather long 2 inch branches, angled as is the upper part of the stem. The small flowers are secund, and the cymes scorpioid, and the flowers on short pedicels on distinct rounded articulations. The petals are nearly as long as the short stamens, ovate. The stamens are 8, all similar, the anthers short oblong blunt at both ends shortly produced below and with a large spathulate linear process from the back from the keeled connective. The capsule I have not seen actually ripe, but nearly ripe ones are cup-shaped short and broad not ribbed nor narrowed at the top as in *Allomorphia*.\n\nA specimen sent to Cogniaux was labelled by him *Octocharis scorpioidea*, but I can hardly in the face of its possessing 8 stamens with appendages refer it to that genus. It is undoubtedly much nearer to *Dreissena* in its axillary inflorescence and appendaged stamens, *Dreissena* however has two appendages.\n\n**PHAULANTHUS N.

The capsule is quite that of the other species except its being more or less covered with rough bristly hairs. The plant occurs on the Taiping hills from the base to about 3,000 feet elevation; at Bukit Kapayung near Sungei Siput in Perak, and in the Temengoh woods, and also at Tasek in Province Wellesley (not Penang as given in the Materials), Curtis 412. The latter is the type of the species *Curtisii* which only differs from the Taiping Hills form in its greater hairiness. The plant however varies considerably in this point, and some of the Taiping Hills plants are nearly as hairy as those of Province Wellesley. A specimen collected by Curtis at 3,000 feet on the Taiping hills is nearly glabrous on the upper surface of the leaves only the midrib being strigose. Those from the base of the hill, and from Temengoh are more hairy.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nAERINCLEISTUS.\n\nThe type of this genus is *A. hirsutus*, Korth. of Sumatra, characterised by its axillary and terminal inflorescence, 8 stamens all similar, and capsule with four oblong valves erect in dehiscence. The species undoubtedly allied to *A. hirsutus* are *A. macranthus*, King, *A. pauciflora*, Ridl.\n\n*A. albiflora*, Ridl. from Gunong Berembun in Perak, differs in the dehiscence of the capsule which splits entirely into its segments, and possesses very short valves. Cogniaux to Korthals\u2019 species added *A. Helferi*, Hook. fil., *A. Griffithii*, Hook. fil., *A. Beccarii* and *A. dispar*. The first two of these have small axillary cymes and no terminal panicle, and I would exclude them. *A. Beccarii*, Cogn., *A. glomeratus*, King, *A. cordatus*, Stapf, though differing in many minor points from Korthals\u2019 type may I think be referred to this genus. *A. floribundus* of King is *Oxyspora macrophylla*, Tri. and *A. sublepidotus* which I have not seen doubtless belongs to the genus.\n\n\u00a7 Coriaceae.

Temengoh woods and banks along the road between Grit and Lenggong. This plant which I identify from description has been very incompletely described, the flowers not having been described at all. It is a very pretty little plant, and extremely different from any other Hedyotis here in its comparatively large rosy flowers. In neither the Flora of British India nor in the Materials is the corolla described at all. A complete description therefore may perhaps be advisable. I met with two forms. That at Temengoh was much longer and with more distant nodes and more lanceolate leaves; the one on the track near Grit more dwarfed and compact with oblong or oblong lanceolate leaves. Stems prostrate a foot or more long or much shorter, rooting at the nodes, the tip ascending often branched. Leaves in pairs, except at the top where they form a whorl of 4 or 5, sessile or very shortly petioled, acute slightly narrowed at the base, 1-2 inches long \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) inch wide thinly coriaceous and stiff, nerves very inconspicuous, pubescent beneath otherwise glabrous. Stipules cup-shaped with several 12 or more bristly setae. Flowers in a dense head surrounded by the whorl of leaves, and mixed with long slender scabrid bristles. Calyx lobes lanceolate acuminate broad 4 margins scabrid. Corolla \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) inch long rose pink, tube cylindric lobes 4 or 5 oblong obtuse, mouth and base of lobes densely covered with white woolly hairs. Stamens 5 adnate to tube with short filaments includeds anthers linear oblong. Style filiform with 2 short arms papillose inside. Capsule ellipsoid, 2 celled. Seeds very numerous black irregularly angled punctate.\n\nKing calls the leaves membranous, Hooker coriaceous. They are stiff and hard when dry, much like those of Spermacoce hispida. The flowers are dimorphic. The stamens being often at the base of the tube instead of near the mouth.\nIt is met with in Burmah, Mergui, and the Lankawi islands as well as Perak.\n\n*Ophiorrhiza rosea*, n. sp.\n\nWhole plant about a foot tall, often much branched, stem woody at base, above pubescent with short incurved hairs. Leaves lanceolate acuminate at both ends, lower ones often unequal, upper ones equal, 3-4 inches long 1 inch wide, above quite glabrous, dark green, beneath usually red, (occasionally pale whitish) midribs and nerves scurfy, petiole \\( \\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{1}{2} \\) inch long. Stipules setaceous pubescent. Cymes solitary terminal or axillary also pubescent, shortly peduncled \\( \\frac{1}{2}-1 \\) inch long, branches divaricate short, lengthening in fruit to 1 inch long. Calyx urceolate with very short lanceolate teeth, pubescent. Bud narrow cylindric. Corolla \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) inch long red, cylindric slightly dilated upwards minutely pubescent, lobes short oblong rounded 5. Anthers linear base cordate nearly as long as the filament. Capsule \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) inch across linear oblong, sinus obsolete or very nearly so glabrous not margined.\n\nAbundant in the Temengoh woods. A form in the Kuala Temengoh woods had longer narrower leaves covered with very short hairs with broad bases.\n\nThis species is nearest to *O. argentea*, Wall. *O. Harrisiana* var *argentea*, differing in its pubescent stem, and scabrid midrib, pink leaves and red flowers, setaceous stipules. I do not see how the *O. argentea*, Wall, as represented in the peninsula by the specimens quoted by King can be *O. Harrisiana* if the figure Wight\u2019s Icones No. 1162 represents the latter plant. Wight\u2019s figure shews a creeping plant not a small bush as *argentea* is. The whole genus is a very difficult one, the species seeming to run into each other with no very clear distinctive characters, and wants very careful critical study.\nOphiorrhiza Mungos, L. said by King to be found in all the provinces, was based on a tall Ceylon plant, which does not closely resemble anything I have seen in the peninsula, and not at all the plant sent out by King as O. Mungos.\n\nI have a large series of the Malay peninsula species in the Singapore Garden Herbarium and find they sort out to a large extent according to districts in which they occur, and thus are probably specifically distinct.\n\nO. erubescens, Wall.

One is the white flowered form of the plains and of the south of the peninsula, occurring in Singapore and Johor. The other is more of a mountain plant with conspicuously yellow flowers. This is the Temengoh plant, which is also a rather exceptionally hairy\none. Wallich's *A. malayana* was based on a Penang plant, and the plants from Penang belong to the yellow flowered form.\n\n*Gardenia tentaculata*, Hook. fil. River bank Kuala Kenering.

Leaves ovate to lanceolate acuminate with a long point, base rounded 2 inches long by one inch wide, nerves 6 pairs glabrous, petiole \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) inch long, stipules lanceolate with a long subulate point. Flowers small in axillary cymes of 2 or 3 flowers, \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) inch long, pedicels half as long pubescent. Calyx cupular hardly lobed, half as long as the corolla tube. Corolla tube thick and short, broad lobes 5 nearly as long, lanceolate triangular subacute fleshy. Stamens 5 nearly sessile, filaments very short in the mouth of the tube, anthers large oblong with a short point glabrous. Pistil; ovary cylindric pubescent, style stout, stigma capitate grooved.

Banks of the Temengoh river. Flowers light orange.\n\nThe plant which I take to be the true *Ixora stricta*, Roxb. grows in forests here and there over the peninsula. I have it from Singapore; Seremban (No. 5004);\nJohor, Tana Runto; Malacca at Batang Malacca (Derry 257), Ayer Panas (Derry 84); Pahang, Tahan river (2227) and Penang Hill 7092 of my collections.\n\nThis plant has comparatively small flowers, the tube slender, the lobes short, often subacute, the leaves broad, but as we go up the rocky streams of the higher lands we find a plant which differs in its habit, size of flowers, and the form of its leaves which may be called var montana.\n\nThis is a straggling shrub with narrow lanceolate leaves gradually acuminate for a long way, 6 inches long and one inch wide, the corolla tube is 2 inches long, the limb \\(\\frac{1}{10}\\) inch across. The typical low-country form has elliptic acuminate to lanceolate leaves and a corolla tube only an inch long and the limb \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) inch across. The difference is so great that at first sight one would hardly identify them as the same species, but there are certainly intermediate stages and I cannot separate them definitely.\n\n*Pavetta indica*, var *polyantha*.

Leaves thinly coriaceous elliptic or lanceolate acuminate acute base cuneate glabrous, nerves conspicuously elevated beneath, 6 inches long, 2 inches wide glabrous or with minute appressed hairs, petiole \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch long on the lower leaves and shorter above.

Corolla lobes 5.\n\n*Psychotria sarmentosa*, var. Lenggong.\n\nThis plant differs from the common Southern Peninsula form in its narrower, thinner leaves with fewer nerves and quite glabrous inflorescence.\n\nI have it from Penang, Kamposa in Kelantan, Kedah, Perak and Bangtaphan in Siam (collected by Dr. Keith).\nPs. ascendens, n. sp.\n\nStems slender climbing and rooting on tree trunks, above pubescent. Leaves ovate subacute base rounded 1-1\u00bd inch long \u00bd-1 inch wide, above glabrous, nerves depressed, beneath pubescent especially on the nerves, nerves slender 7 pairs meeting within the margin in loops, petiole very short \u00bc inch or less long pubescent. Stipules very small pubescent caducous. Cymes lax on slender peduncles pubescent, peduncles 1 inch or less. Whole cyme about 1\u00bd to 2 inches long, branches spreading. Bracts lanceolate pubescent, \u215b inch long. Bracteoles linear smaller. Pedicels pubescent \u00bc inch long. Calyx tube short campanulate, 5 lobed lobes acute. Corolla \u215b inch long, lobes 5 oblong obtuse pubescent outside, as long as the tube inside the tube, mouth woolly. Anthers 5 subsessile. Fruit \u00bc inch long elliptic narrowed at the base and slightly often towards the tip with 8 grooves.\n\nTemengoh, creeping on tree trunks low down.\n\nThis plant resembles closely one distributed from the Buitenzorg gardens by Koorders under the number 29375b and the name Psychotria ? laxiflora, Bl., but this plant is quite glabrous. Now Ps. laxiflora is described by Blume as having the leaves glabrous and narrowed at the base which neither the Temengoh, nor Koorders\u2019 plant has. In the Materials, King and Gamble describe P. laxiflora, Bl., as having 4 sepals, corolla lobes and stamens. The number of parts is not mentioned in Blume or Miquel\u2019s description, and Koorders\u2019 plant has 5 calyx lobes on the fruit. I have seen no plant corresponding to Blume\u2019s and Miquel\u2019s descriptions in the Malay peninsula and the specimens Singapore (Ridley 13 and 4828), given in the Materials as Ps. laxiflora, Bl., are both Gaertnera viminea and part of the description of the Psychotria at least\n\nR.

Blume referred *S. tortilis*, Korthals to the genus *Psychotria* and King and Gamble as well as others followed this. Dr. Stapf however in the Flora of Kinabalu, Trans. Linn. Soc. IV. 182. Pl. XIII. A, in making the new species, *S. urticina*, urges that the old genus should be restored. This I think is advisable and the genus would then comprise the following species.\n\n1. *S. tortilis*, Korth. Kruidk. Arch.

Straits Branch\n2. *St. hirta*, n. sp.\n\nStem unbranched about a foot tall, woody below, and glabrescent hairy above \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) inch through at the base. Leaves lanceolate acuminate, narrowed at the base, 4-6 inches long \\( 1\\frac{1}{2}-2 \\) inches wide, nerves 8-9 pairs, above minutely punctate, and sprinkled thickly over with long pale hairs, beneath similar but the nerves very densely hairy, petiole \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) an inch long, hairy. Stipules forming a broad cup bifid on both sides, about a third of their length, tips cuspidate glabrous. Panicle short dense hairy \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) inch through. Bracts lanceolate hairy narrow. Pedicels hairy much longer than the calyx. Calyx campanulate very small with 5 ovate lobes as long as the tube, hairy. Fruit hairy subglobose flattened at the top, grooved between the 2 cocci.\n\nFrom *S. tortilis*, Korth. this differs in its hairy narrower leaves and hairy fruit, not brown streaked and very much broader stipules forming a cup.\n\n3. *S. pubescens*, n. sp.\n\nStem about a foot tall, woody, often taller, young parts red hairy, old portions glabrous swollen at the nodes, \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) inch through. Leaves ovate acute base cuneate 6 inches long, 3 inches across, herbaceous above glabrous, minutely pustulate beneath shortly scurfily red pubescent on the nerves; nerves about 12 pairs slender subhorizontal; petiole 1 inch long pubescent. Stipules papery lanceolate acuminate, \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) inch long glabrous except for a pubescent keel. Flowers in dense axillary panicles from the axils of fallen leaves, 1 to 2 inches long, the branches growing as the fruit develops, all covered with red pubescence. Rachis flexuous with flowers nearly sessile in pairs. Bracts lanceolate acuminate with glandular hairs on the edges, keel, and back. Flowers very small \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\) inch long, pedicels very short and thick. Calyx very short campanu-\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 57, 1910.\nlate with 5 short acute lobes tufted with hair. Corolla very short tube cylindric, lobes 5 oblong rounded at the tip pubescent outside white. Stamens shorter than the corolla, filaments slender rising from near the base of the tube. Anthers as long as the filaments. Style shorter stout thick with 2 oblong rounded flat white stigmatic arms. A disc of 5 pinkish reniform glandular bodies surrounding the style base, becoming a circle in the fruit. Fruit hairy, ovoid. Seeds 2 elliptic ovoid dark brown minutely punctate.\n\nStreblosa.\n\nJohor, Gunong Panti; Perak, Temengoh Woods; Penang, Balik Pulau (Ridley 9425); Dindings at Telok Serah.\n\nVery distinct from S. tortilis, Korth. in its being woody, and the Dindings form has narrower more lanceolate leaves, long acuminate at the base.\n\nS. urticina, Stapf. This is given in the original description as herbaceous and scandent. The specimen from Kinabalu of Haviland's collection in the Herbarium of the Botanic Gardens, Singapore, is decidedly woody. I obtained plants at Puak in Borneo (12430 of my collection) and at Lundu (12432) which I am unable to separate from S. urticina. They are more robust with larger leaves, the stem quite woody and erect.\n\nI have another species from Sarawak which I will describe here.\n\nS. bracteata n. sp.\n\nStem tall over 18 inches long woody glabrous, nearly \u00bc inch through. Leaves ovate lanceolate, subacute narrowed to the base, 6-7 inches long 4 inches wide glabrous except for a little scurfy pubescence on the midrib, nerves slender 20 pairs, petiole 1-1\u00bd inch long. Stipules broad glabrous, oblong deeply bifid with the\nlanceolate points ending in subulate cusps, \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch long. Panicles dense an inch long, few branched on slender scurfy peduncles half an inch long. Bracts oblong obtuse glabrous longer than the flowers. Pedicels longer than the flower pubescent. Calyx urn-shaped pubescent, with 5 short ovate lobes much shorter than the tube. Corolla and stamens not seen. Fruit \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\) inch long elliptic narrowed to the tip glabrous, with 8 ribs longer than broad.\n\nBorneo, Sarawak, Jambusan (12437) and Bau (11741) of my collections.\n\nThis is a very distinct plant in its almost entirely glabrousness, and its large oblong bracts. It appears to be most closely allied to Korthals' *S. undulata* described in the above quoted paper. I have seen no specimen of his, nor the original paper in which it was described but the description is given in Miquel's Flor. Ind. Bat. Vol. II p. 294 under Psychotria as follows.\n\n*S. undulata*, Korth. \"Folia elliptica undulata subtus in nervis hirsuta, stipulae ovatae acuminatae ciliatae, flores in axillis densi conferti, bracteis oblongis sustenti.\"\n\nBorneo ad Sakoembang.\n\nNow this though resembling *S. bracteata* in its peculiar bracts, differs in the nerves beneath not being hairy, and the form of the stipules so I conclude Korthals did not intend *S. bracteata* by his description of *S. undulata*.\n\nThe description of his *S. polyantha* in the same publication is as follows. \"Caulis nodosus hirsutus, folia ovata utrinque acuta, supra sparse subtus in nervis dense hirsuta, stipulae rotundatae undulatae, flori in racemis abbreviatis conferti.\" Sumatra ad Singa-lang.

Two or three species are recorded from Madagascar, two including the present one from the Malay peninsula, one from Borneo and one from Cuba, one from Japan and one from Hongkong.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 57, 1910.\nThe other Malay peninsula species is *S. Maingayi*; Hook. fil, a plant which has only twice been met with, once by Maingay in Malacca but exactly where is not recorded and once at Changi in Singapore by Hullett. No one else has apparently ever seen it. Many years ago I visited with Mr. Hullett the spot where he found the jungle trees draped with this beautiful species, but neither then nor later could we find any of it, and since then this spot has been destroyed for some minor cultivation. As the flowers are over two inches across and pale yellow, the plant would be conspicuous enough, and possibly it is a shy flowerer and might be overlooked out of flower.\n\n*S. parviflora*, I have twice met with at Tapah, it was growing abundantly over a tree by a stream on the roadside but in spite of all searching I could only find one flower and one bud. At Temengoh the plant collector got a single specimen with one flower. It is evidently a shy flowerer. In general appearance both in foliage and flower, it resembled a very small form of *Hoya coronaria*, but examination showed it was no *Hoya* but a true *Stephanotis* very distinct from any other species, in the small size of its flowers, its short corolla tube, the long staminal corona, visible and almost projecting beyond the mouth of the tube. The staminal column is peculiar in having the processes terminating in rather a long oblong bifid limb, much overtopping the style apex.\n\n*Hoya perakensis*, n. sp.\n\nStems slender creeping and rooting.

It is common in Upper Perak, and in Selangor by the Batu Caves. The Pekan plant mentioned under *fragrans* true in the Materials is also the var *Javanica*. The typical form of *fragrans* nearly glabrous and with smaller flowers occurs as an escape in Singapore in hedges round Tanglin, etc. with *T. alata*, Sims. The species does not occur truly wild at all in Singapore and Kunstler's plant quoted in the Materials must have been an escape.\n\n*Th. laurifolia*, Lindl., Temengoh woods.\n\nThis is common over most of the low country woods of the Peninsula.\n\n*Th. grandiflora*, Roxb. given in the Materials as from Singapore collected by Schomburgk, was obviously from a garden plant. It is not a native of the Peninsula so far as I have seen and certainly not from Singapore. It remains a considerable time in abandoned gardens, but I do not think ever fruits here. Clarke in the Materials says it runs excessively close to *Th. lauri-folia*, and corrects Lindau's remarkable statement that it\nhas solitary axillary flowers. The racemes in fact are conspicuously long. The two species however in life are extremely different in appearance, and cannot be confused. The leaves of *Th. laurifolia* are narrower entire or almost with a small side lobe, and deep green. The racemes are much shorter as are the pedicels. The calyx is narrow and entire; bifid to the base and much broader in *grandiflora*. The corolla in *laurifolia* is much smaller, and the style longer. In the Botanical Magazine *Th. laurifolia* is figured (Pl. 4985) of a pale pink, the description of it however says it is blue. It is figured again as *T. Harrisii*, Hook.

It may be specifically distinct, as it seems always to be dwarf, with rather narrower leaves, and I have never seen the true confinis a much taller plant growing with it. It always occurs in short grass under bushes in old orchards.\n\nEranthemum porphyranthos, C. B. C. Common in shady open spots at Temengoh and Lenggong. This is very widely spread over the Peninsula. The color of the flower somewhat variously described in the Materials is always a pinkish violet. Clarke's var evolutior is hardly worth keeping up.

Lower lip lobes distinct at tip oblong. Anthers with one cell below the other, appendage conic white. Capsule \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) inch long glabrous, seeds 4 orbicular flat verrucose light brown.\n\nTemengoh forests. The linear bracts considerably longer than the flowers are unlike those of any other species known to me.\n\n*J. secundiflora* n. sp.\n\nA herb erect or ascending 6 to 12 inches tall, stem brown hairy. Leaves opposite subequal lanceolate obtuse or subacute, occasionally ovate, base acuminate, above dark green, thickly dotted with small white raphides bundles beneath green or purple glabrous and dotted except the nerves covered with appressed brown hairs 2-6 inches long, 2-2\\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) inch wide, petiole 1 inch long hairy.

Corolla \\( \\frac{3}{8} \\) inch long, glabrous, tube cylindric rather thick as long as the limb, bright yellow with purple dots on the lower lip and in the tube, lobes of the lower lip minutely velvety. Stamens 2 shorter than the corolla, filaments rather stout. Anther cells very unequal, the lower one adnate nearly at the lowest point of the upper one, light brown, the appendage white cylindric conic that of the lower cell longest. Anthers dehiscing only in the lower third.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nVery common all over the Temengoh woods and very variable, sometimes quite a low almost prostrate plant, at others tall and flaccid. In some forms the leaves are in part quite ovate, almost rotund, in others elongate lanceolate long acuminate at both ends, some have the leaves green on both sides, others purple beneath (14530).\n\n*J. uber*, Clarke.

Retinacula short blunt.\n\nTemengoh. Grit and Kuala Kenering (14527, 14528).\n\nAbundant along the edges of streams forming thick clumps. The smaller leaf is about half as big as the larger one. I suppose this to be the *J. Neesiana*, Wall. of the Materials. The bracts in the description in the Flora of British India are described in all of this set as obovate or spathulate, but in a plant named *J. quadrifaria*, Wall. by Clarke they are lanceolate acuminate.\n\n*J. sessilis*, n. sp.\n\nA weak, long creeping ascending herb, young parts pubescent. Leaves unequal in distant pairs, large one lanceolate to ovate acuminate, base rounded somewhat unequal sessile, \\( 1\\frac{1}{2}-3 \\) inches long, \\( \\frac{1}{2}-1\\frac{1}{4} \\) inch wide, nerves primary about 6 pairs, quite glabrous, small leaf ovate cordate \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) inch long. Racemes axillary \\( \\frac{3}{4}-1 \\) inch long with a slender pedicel and 3 or four terminal flowers. Bracts minute linear lanceolate. Flowers \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) inch long.

Seeds four flattened rounded reniform minutely pustulate.\n\nUlu Temengoh (14529).\n\nMr. Clarke describes in the Materials several species of this section from the collections of Kunstler which I have not seen. The nearest of these is *J. otophora*, of which the description is very incomplete. However, the plant described above is pubescent and the stem is not zigzag and on the whole I do not think this can be the plant intended by him.\nARISTOLOCHIACEAE.\n\nThottea parvilora n. sp.\n\nA shrub about 3 feet tall, the stems nearly \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) inch thick, shortly pubescent with stellately arranged hairs. Leaves ovate or obovate acute, base shortly narrowed, 8 inches long or less 4 inches across, above glabrous, beneath sprinkled with short white hairs, petiole thick \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) inch long. Racemes extra axillary half an inch long, hairy. Flowers crowded, appearing singly small violet. Bracts ovate very small, hairy. Pedicel hairy \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) inch long. Perianth \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) inch across, lobes ovate obtuse, violet hairy outside, tube short campanulate. Stamens 16, filaments very shorthairy, anther oblong extrorse. Style 5 lobed. Fruit slender 2 inches long ending in a long point.\n\nTemengoh hill woods, very distinct from any species known to me by its small pale violet flowers.\n\nThere is really very little difference between the genera Thottea and Bragantia and the chief one lies in the number of the stamens which is larger in Thottea. The greater size of the flowers as a distinctive character fails with Th. parvilora whose flowers are smaller than those of the next species.\n\nBragantia tomentosa, Benn. Abundant in damp shady spots in the Temengoh forests.\n\nPIPERACEAE.\n\nThe collection of Peppers in the Singapore herbarium have been recently identified by M. C.

It has so much the appearance of a Loxogramma that I took it for one at first, but Dr. Christ pointed out it was a Vittaria and suggested that it was a distinct species and might be named \\( V. \\) loxogrammoides. I suggested it might be a peculiar woodland form of \\( V. \\) scolopendrina especially as I have also found it at Kranji in Singapore Dr. Christ writes \"The thin fronds dilated towards the tip as well as the insertion of the soriferous lines, finally the flaccid tissue not stiff seems to me sufficiently different from the \\( Vittaria \\) scolopendrina of Trimen from Ceylon. But it is quite possible that the plant is more variable than I thought and you being on the spot are right not to separate this form, you know anyway that the Vittarias are a terrible group. The more one studies them the more confused one gets. It is a study for the botanists of the 20th century perhaps even for those of the 21st.\"\n\nCertainly as Dr. Christ says the genus is very difficult; there are so few definite characters that the varieties seem those of degree rather than of detail.\n\nR.

S.,\nCurator of the Sarawak Museum.\n\nThe only publications dealing with Cicadidae from Borneo are, (i) a \"Catalogue of the Homopterous insects collected at Sarawak, Borneo, by Mr. A. R. Wallace, with Descriptions of New Species,\" by Francis Walker F. L. s., published in the Journal of the Linnean Society, London, 1857; and, (ii) a comprehensive \"Monograph of the Oriental Cicadidae\" by W. L. Distant, which was published in 1889-92. In the former paper, eleven* species of Cicadidae are enumerated, of which two are no longer traceable. In Mr. Distant's memoir, out of no less than 268 species dealt with, only 36 are noticed from Borneo. As might be expected, many other species have been recorded since that date; and as it may be of some interest to students and collectors of the Fauna of the Malay Archipelago, I have compiled the following list of Cicadidae which are at present known from Borneo. This paper cannot pretend to contain a complete list of all Bornean Cicadidae; for in our present lack of entomological knowledge of the greater part of this island\u2014so rich in insect fauna\u2014there must yet remain many more species to be discovered, and the distribution of those now known must also be greatly extended. It is also\n\n*(1) Platyleura semilucida, Walk., (4) Tacua speciosa, Illiger,\n(26) Dundubia immacula, Walk., (35) Dundubia phaeophila, Walk.,\n(50) Dundubia Thalia, Walk., (30) Dundubia intemerata, Walk.,\n(30a) Dundubia decem, Walk., (31) Dundubia duarum, Walk.,\n(10) Fidicina aquila, Walk., (63) Huechys splendidula, Fab., (62)\nHuechys facialis, Walk. (The numbers before each species refer to the numbers applied to the species in this paper).\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 57, 1910.\nprobable that the few private collections made in this country may possess some species not mentioned in this list; and perhaps one or two European museums, which I have not been able to consult, may contain some too.\n\nSo the purpose of this paper has been to serve rather as a basis for a chapter on this family of Rhynchota when the time comes for the Fauna of Borneo to be treated in one comprehensive work. And if those who have in their keeping, collections of Cicadidae from this island, will add to this list; and if entomologists in Borneo are interested sufficiently to add to it as well, the purpose of this paper will be fully served.\n\nIn compiling this list I have to acknowledge my debt of gratitude to Mr. W. L. Distant who has from time to time identified most of the species in the Sarawak Museum; to Mr. Howard Ashton of Sydney for identifying species; and to the following gentlemen who have kindly supplied me with data of species in their possession:\u2014Dr. N. Annandale of the Indian Museum, M.le Vicomte du Buysson of the Paris Museum, Dr. R. Hanitsch of the Raffles Museum, Singapore, Dr. R. Gestro of the Museo Civico, Genoa, and Mr. C. J. Brooks of Upper Sarawak.\n\nThe system of classification followed is that set forth by Mr. W. L. Distant in his \"Synonymic Catalogue of Homoptera, Part III. Cicadidae,\" and reference is made to that work in the case of each species. In addition to this, the following works have been consulted: \"Repr\u00e9sentation des Cigales\" by Caspar Stoll (1788); Journal of the Linnean Society, London, 1857, in which appears the paper on Sarawak Homoptera by Francis Walker; Annals and Magazine of Natural History (1887-1906); \"Monograph of the Oriental Cicadidae\" by W. L. Distant (1889-1892), and Rhynchota, Vol. III, of the Fauna of British India series, by W. L. Distant.\n\nThe names of the localities are placed in order, beginning from Sandakan (Elopura) in the North-East of Borneo; then to the North of the island: from thence westward through Sarawak, and south to Pontianak, and so round to the South-East of Borneo, where Mr. Doherty collected many species.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nBORNEAN CICADIDAE.\n\nA few remarks on the distribution of Bornean Cicadidae relative to other parts of Malaya, have been placed at the end; also an Appendix containing the description of a new species by Mr. Howard Ashton.\n\nSub.

However Mr. Distant in his Monograph of the Oriental Cicadidae (p. 20) mentions that a slight variety has been described by Mr. Butler under the name of P. fuscangulis, and that he has given it the habitat of \"Sarawak (Wallace).\"\n\nR. A.

Soc., No. 57, 1910,\nGeneral distribution: Malaya.\nJava, Sumatra, Sulu Islands and Perak.\n\nThis is distinctly a variable species; and there are two marked varieties in the Sarawak Museum which are perhaps worthy of comment. They are both females and are noticeable for the reduced black markings on the pronotum and mesonotum. The two black central fasciae of the mesonotum become reduced towards the pronotum, so as to leave a small central patch of ground-colour, while in the typical form these fasciae grow wider and finally meet on the border of the pronotum. The dark pronotal markings are also reduced.\n\nThere is another curious aberration in this collection, taken on the upper waters of the Limbang River (April 1910). In this example the neuration of the left tegmen is abnormal in two places. The first ulnar area is closed by an additional vein about 2 mm. short of the apical end of that area. The third apical area is also shortened by an additional vein about 2 mm. short of the basal end of that area; the addition of these two small veins thus results in the formation of two small post-ulnar or pre-apical cells. The second abnormality is produced by a small additional vein enclosing the apex of the fourth ulnar area. The neuration of the left tegmen is normal.\n\nI have also noticed a small aberration in the neuration of a specimen of *Dundubia rufivena*, Walk.; and it is perhaps interesting to note that the neuration of *Cicadidae* is evidently prone to variation while that of Lepidoptera is so stable that some systematists have been led to base their classifications on that character alone.\n\n8. *Rihana umbrosa*, Dist.\n\nAnn.

Distant in his volume on the Rhynchota (Fauna of British India Series, p. 95), says of this species:\u2014\"This is a most abundant species and found throughout the East.\"\n\nIn the Malay Archipelago, it is known to occur in Java, Sumatra, Celebes and Palawan; and beyond these islands, it has been recorded from Hongkong, the Philippines, Assam, Tenasserim, Sikkim, Burma, Johore, Province Wellesley, Penang and Australia. I can find no record of it from New Guinea, though on considering the extent of its range, one would expect a record of it from that country.\n\n* Kedurong is a small promontory on the Sarawak Coast about half-way between Kuching and Labuan. There is a light-house there, and I recently handed over to the Malay in charge, two killing-bottles, with instructions to collect insects for me, especially Cicadas. Five nights' collecting resulted in the following:\u201414 Dundubia manufera, 5 Platytomia umbrata, 11 Champaka viridimaculata, 2 Cosmopsaltria duarum, 43 C. latilinea, 2 C. ida, sp. n., 1 C. montivaga and 3 Ayesha spathulata; total 81 specimens. With the exception of one female A. spathulata, all the remaining 80 were males. (September 1910).\nStoll* calls this species *La Cigale Chanteuse Verte*.\n\n27. **Dundubia aerata**, Dist.\n\nAnn.

Oberthur\u2014Paris Mus.); South-East Borneo (Doherty\u2014coll. Distant).\n\nThis species is very common in Kuching at house lights during the months of March, April and May, and it has been taken in other months, but from the large series in the Sarawak Museum I am inclined to think that it particularly favours those early three months of the year, when it is certainly the commonest Cicada in Kuching.\n\n---\n\n* Casper Stoll in his delightful volume \"Cigales\" (1788) describes this insect thus (p. 38):\u2014\"La T\u00eate, les Yeux, une partie du Corselet, ainsi que l'Abdomen, sont, brun clair par le haut; le reste du Corps a une couleur verd\u00e2tre p\u00e2le. Les Plaques qui couvrent l'instrument, avec lequel cette famille de Cigales fait le bruit connu, sont extraordinairement grandes, renfermant les bords sup\u00e9rieurs de l'Abdomen duquel elles ont presque toute la longueur, ainsi qu'on peut le voir par celle de la Fig. A, qui montre tr\u00e8s-exactement le dessous de ce singulier Insecte. Les Ailes sont transparentes comme du verre, et on d\u00e9couvre clairement les petits Yeux lis-\u00e8s rouges, plac\u00e9s dans un triangle au milieu de la T\u00eate.

Mus.); Western Borneo (Brit. Mus.).\n\nI have identified a single male in the Sarawak Museum, which was taken near Kuching in April, as this species; but the very slight difference in the shape of the opercula seems hardly sufficient to give it specific distinction from *D. rufivena*. From the figures of these two species in Mr. Distant\u2019s Monograph of the Oriental Cicadidae (Pl. vi., fig. 6, a, b, and Pl. xii., fig. 9, a, b), the only noticeable difference seems to be that the opercula of the male *D. mellea* are slightly more evenly rounded at their base than in *D. rufivena*, where the outer and lower angle is more produced and more pointed. In regard to the colour, Mr. Distant himself admitted in his Monograph to having seen forms of so intermediate a character that he recognized the possibility of its being a subspecies or simple variety of *D. rufivena*.\n\n30. *Dundubia intemerata*, Walk.\n\nJourn.

Fore wings with an indistinct pale brown streak on each marginal areolet; veins green, partly black; transverse veinlets and tips of the marginal veins clouded with blackish-brown. Length of the body 18 lines; of the wings 58 lines.\u201d\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 57, 1910.*\nDistant in his Monograph of the Oriental Cicadidae (p. 49) says of this species and the next: \"C. lauta and C. latilinea are very closely allied, and they are evidently local races of one species.\"\n\nIn as much as they have both been taken in one locality in Sarawak, and since they present well-marked and constant differences, I prefer to treat them as separate species.\n\nThe Sarawak examples of C. duarum (C. lauta) vary in the heaviness of the mesonotal markings, the ground-colour of the pronotum and mesonotum, which ranges from olive-green and ochreous brown to a bleached olive, and the black marginal suffusions in the opercula vary in breadth and definition.\n\n32.

Brocks).\n\nPreviously it has only been recorded from Penang.\n\nThis species is easily distinguishable from the preceding by the presence in the tegmina of fuscous spots at the base of the fifth and seventh apical areas, and a row of hind-marginal fuscous spots at the end of the transverse veins. The fuscous border on the opercula is always well-defined and varies but little in breadth.\n\nThe following variations are noticeable in a long series in the Sarawak Museum:\n\n(a) The absence or presence of a black oblique line on each side of the pronotum.\n(b) The central fascia can widen considerably towards the cruciform elevation.\n\n(c) The two centro-lateral fascia can be either slender or widen in centre to almost touch central line; they can either join or be quite separate from the thickened portion of the medial fascia.\n\n(d) The abdominal markings are either light-green and black, giving a mottled appearance, or they incline to uniform brown.\n\n33. *Cosmopsaltria ida*, n. sp.\n\n*Male.* Abdomen slightly longer than length from apex of head to cruciform elevation. Rostrum just reaches posterior coxae. Head ochreous-olive; pronotum, mesonotum and abdomen olivaceous-green. Vertex of head with black lateral striations, and one oblique black line on each side of head in fold between base of vertex and eye. Ocelli yellow, surrounded with black. Two thin lines down centre of pronotum, joined at base. On mesonotum a thin black longitudinal central line; on each side of this, from anterior margin, a short thin inwardly oblique black fascia; followed exteriorly by a similar short and thin inwardly oblique black fascia in the posterior portion of the mesonotum. In front of cruciform elevation two small black spots. Head and legs beneath ochreous-olive, but apices of tibi\u00e6, the anterior and median tarsi, and the apices of posterior tarsi are black. Opercula long, reaching base of last abdominal segment, concavely narrowed near base, inwardly rounded towards apex. Ground-colour of opercula ochreous, tinged with green at base and towards apex; a narrow well-defined black border along inner margin widening at apex. Abdomen beneath dark olivaceous. Tegmina and wings hyaline; the former slightly suffused with brown in the apical and hind marginal regions. Anterior femora and posterior tibi\u00e6 spined as in *Cosmopsaltria latilinea*.\nLength excl. tegm. 30 mm.; exp. tegm. 85 mm.\n\nHabitat: Kedurong, Sarawak.\n\nType \u2642: in Sarawak Museum. \u2640 unknown.\n\nAllied to *Cosmopsaltria latilinea* by reason of its opercula, which are very similar.

The Museum collection possesses specimens taken at Kuching, Kapit, Mt. Matang and Mt. Penrissen; and the only two months in which these specimens were not taken, are January and October; so that we may safely suppose that the insect is to be taken all the year round. Besides the above localities it has been recorded from: Sandakan (Indian Mus. and Pryer\u2014coll. Distant); Kina Balu (Whitehead\u2014coll. Distant); Bidi (coll. C. J. Brooks); Pontianak (Brussels Mus.).\n\nGeneral distribution: Malaya.\n\nMalacca, Province Wellesley, Perak, Java and Sumatra.\n\nDr. O. Beccari* writes of this insect thus:\u2014\"One species (*Pomponia imperatoria*, Westw.), which the Malays\n\n* In Bornean Forests, O. Beccari, 1904, p. 11.\nhave named \"kriang pokul anam\" or \"the six o'clock Cicada,\" is a giant; one of the specimens we got measured nearly $7\\frac{1}{2}$ inches across the wings. It begins at sunset and the noise it makes is not unlike the braying of an ass in high treble, and can be heard at a distance of many hundred yards.\" The largest specimen, a male, in the Sarawak Museum is just short of 8 inches; and Mr. Distant records a female 216 mm., (or $8\\frac{1}{2}$ inches) across, from Perak.\n\nI have heard it myself in many places in Sarawak, beginning as a rule a little before 6 p.m., and I can confirm Dr. Beccari's description of its song.\n\n46. *Pomponia merula*, Dist.\n\nAnn.

Distant).\n\nGeneral distribution: Malaya to New Guinea.\nSumatra and New Guinea.\n\nA brief consideration of the geographical distribution of these species yields a few interesting considerations; though on the other hand one must put but little trust in the actual figures given, owing to our lack of any thing like complete knowledge about the Cicadidae of this region. The numerous and productive islands of the Malay Archipelago must certainly produce many more species as soon as larger collections are made, and localities more systematically worked; and thus the relative numbers here quoted perhaps will be altered a good deal, though the general conclusions will probably hold good.\n\nThe total number of species recorded from Borneo in this paper amounts to 71, representing 23 genera. Out of this total, 28 species are at present confined to Borneo; though here again, one must expect to find the distribution of many of these species prove to be considerably wider. To facilitate a quick comprehension of the geographical distributed of the remaining 43 species, I have appended a list of them in tabular form.\n\nIt will at once be seen that the majority are well distributed over Malaya; and that the largest number of species are to be found in the Malay Peninsula (23); while Java and Sumatra come next with 19 each. Of these species four are peculiar to Borneo and the Peninsula, two to Borneo and Java, and two to Borneo and Sumatra;\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 57, 1910.\nfour more species are confined to these three islands and the Peninsula. An indication of the affinity between the fauna of India and Borneo is shown by the occurrence of 16 species common to both countries. And in the North-east we find 11 species common to the Philippine Islands and Borneo. The record of but two species in Celebes, which are also found in Borneo, is perhaps worthy of notice considering the position of the two islands.\n\nIn short it seems that, in regard to Cicadidae at least, Borneo has a very fairly distinct fauna of its own, seeing that over one third of the number recorded, are confined to Borneo. Then secondly it appears that this particular group of Cicadidae have for their centre, a region comprising Borneo, Java, Sumatra and the Peninsula; and that thence there is one extension, or line of relation, to the north and west through Burma to India, and another to the east and north through the Sulu Islands to the Philippines, meeting a third extension north from the Peninsula to Hongkong, Corea and Japan. Thus Borneo forms the South-Eastern limit to the range of this group, although we must not forget the two species which go beyond this limit, viz. *Muda beccarii*, which occurs in New Guinea, and the ubiquitous *Dundubia mannifera*, which extends its range as far as Australia.\nTable showing the Geographical Distribution of Bornean Cicadidae.\n\n| MALAYA. | Celebes. | Other islands.* | Java. | Sumatra. | Nias Island. | Peninsula + | Burma | Assam, Tenasserim, India. | Tibet. | China \u2021 | Japan. | Philippines. | New Guinea. | Australia. |\n|---------|----------|-----------------|-------|----------|--------------|-------------|-------|---------------------------|--------|--------|--------|-------------|------------|-----------|\n|         |          |                 |       |          |              |             |       |                           |        |        |        |             |            |           |\n| 1.

Kloss.\n\nThe intimate connection that exists between plague and rats is a matter to which very little attention seems to have been paid in the Straits Settlements beyond the organised destruction of the animals on a small scale by the Municipal bodies of Singapore and Penang, for if any researches have taken place the result has not been made public. The question does not affect the Federated Malay States to quite the same extent, as its towns are not so directly connected with the birth-places of such epidemics as are those of the Colony.\n\nThe matter has, however, excited considerable interest in India in the last few years and the Indian Museum has published the outcome of investigations, by Dr. W. C. Hossack of the Calcutta Plague Department and of Surgeon-Captain R. E. Lloyd of the Indian Marine Survey. * The Bombay Natural History Society deals with the subject in one of its journals\u2020 and Indian Municipalities, have also issued Plague Reports but is the publications of the India Museum that are noticed here.\n\nIn a preliminary pamphlet Dr. Hossack gives some instructions for collecting specimens of rats for study which could easily be improved on and follows these, for the benefit of the inexperienced observer, with \"a succinct account of the rats of\n\n* W.

The names of other species are noted but they are not considered to be of any practical importance to the Indian worker and the little house-mouse goes into the same category. It is pointed out that the Musk-rats or Musk-shrews (*Crocidura murina* and *C. caerulea*), \u201cTikus turi\u201d and \u201cChenchurot\u201d of Malays, are not rodents at all but insectivores, and though dwellers in cellars and drains do not appear susceptible to plague. The descriptions given are broad but probably sufficiently detailed for success in identification when the limited number of species that are likely to come before the sanitary officer is borne in mind.\n\nDr. Hossack\u2019s next essay consists of an illustrated account of the rats of Calcutta. Though the author admits that he was an absolute tyro for whom it was difficult to discuss the present state of systematic zoology dealing with the subject, he nevertheless ventures more than once to criticise the work of systematists. This is also the case with Captain Lloyd who is far from successful in his efforts in this direction. To criticise the validity of insular Malayan species as Dr. Hossack does is gratuitous, since they are a class of which he, a worker in a great land area, whose acquaintance with the *Murinae* is very limited and admittedly recent, is entirely ignorant.\n\nIt is perhaps unfortunate that both authors take for the basis of their work Mr. Oldfield Thomas\u2019s then epoch-making\u2014and still most valuable\u2014paper of 1881 on the Indian species of the Genus *Mus*, *not* appreciating the fact that the increase of knowledge in the last quarter of a century has brought to light many new facts with the necessary result that a commensurate alteration of opinion has taken place\u2014a state of affairs that Mr. Thomas would probably be the first to admit: for instance, he has recently divided *Nesokia* which he then regarded as only a sub-genus of *Mus* into three independent\n\n---\n\n* Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London for 1881, pp. 521\u2013557.\ngenera. These are recognised, at least by Captain Lloyd, but throughout the reports we find a blind belief in the pronouncements of Mr. Thomas as a repudiation of the findings of all other systematic workers. Dr. Hossack has omitted to place in his list of Indian rats the names of *Mus mettada* and *Mus humei*: as the one is included by Mr. Thomas in the paper noted above and the other is described by him, it is curious that this author does not find them acceptable!\n\nThe bulk of Dr. Hossack's work which is, as far as it goes excellent, is taken up with an account of those rats of Calcutta which he has found to be connected with plague; these are *Mus decumanus*, Pallas, *Nesokia (Gunomys)*, *bengalensis*, Gray and Hardw., various forms of *Mus rattus* Linn., and *Nesokia (Bandicota) nemorivaga*, Hodgs.\n\nAmongst the animals brought to him the last was very rare and *Mus rattus* only formed about 15 per cent of the total. In connection with the others an interesting fact was noted: that while in the northern native area of Calcutta, where grain stores and huts abound, *N. bengalensis* and *M. decumanus* occurred or rather were caught, in the ratios of 60 and 26 per cent of the total; yet in the central European portion of the city these proportions were strikingly reversed, *M. decumanus* forming 51 per cent and *N. bengalensis* only 37 per cent of the catch.\n\nCareful dates for distinguishing the immature from the adult animal are given; a key is furnished for distinguishing the various species together with elaborate descriptions and measurements of each and a supplement contains coloured illustrations of the plague rats together with figures of skulls, teeth and feet.\n\nSurgeon-Captain Lloyd's paper bears the unfortunately ambitious title of \"The Races of Indian Rats,\" though it is quickly obvious that the author has an acquaintance with but a small section of them. While no doubt where those connected with plague are concerned, he is on safe ground, such is not the case when he deals with the genus *Mus* as a whole and the confusion then brought about seems to be almost entirely\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 57, 1910.\ndue to his total non-acquaintance with the group of non-rattus rats with bicolored tails and spiny coats; and to failure in grasping the fact that these animals are never found in towns. He thus mistakes for these latter the sports which occur so frequently amongst the rattus group.\n\nThe author's faulty knowledge of the Eastern portion of the genus Mus is illustrated by the statement (p. 9) that \"over ninety species of rats have been described from the oriental region which are indisputably closely allied to Mus rattus.\" This is a decided error: less than one-third of the names in the list he refers to, including synonyms, can be attached to animals of the rattus group, and the remainder are nearly all those of members of groups whose centres of distribution are outside the Indian sub-region altogether\u2014if the rural areas therein have been thoroughly worked,\u2014and on its borders are represented by very few species only; i.e., Mus jerdoni and perhaps Mus niveiventer from the Himalayas with Mus bowersi from Manipur and Yunnan, and Mus berdmorei from Manipur Tenasserim.\n\nOn p. 10, Mus jerdoni is rightly excluded from the rattus group, yet on pp. 93 and 94 it is claimed \"on sure evidence\" as one of four established races of the rattus type.\" The reason for this laying down of the law seems to have arisen from the fact that several animals with bicolored tails\u2014evidently abnormal examples of Mus rattus\u2014were caught in houses in Naini Tal and\u2014because of their albinistic traits\u2014regarded as example of Mus jerdoni. Had it been understood that this latter with many others of its type is a rat of purely rural habitat, such confusion would have been impossible.\n\nThe bicoloration of the tail is not, as is stated on p. 89, \"the all-important feature in the description of many species of the rattus group,\" but it is of secondary importance in descriptions of non-rattus species and in separating these latter from the others. Normal rattus rats do not have bicoloured tails, though Mus vicerex, Bonhot, appears to be an exception.\n\nThe bulk of the paper is concerned with descriptions of the rats obtained in the towns of India in connection with plague investigations but its value is largely obscured by the\n\nJour, Straits Branch\ngreat amount of attention that is given to the consideration of \"sports,\" and by too frequent references to those species of which the author has no personal acquaintance\u2014the non-*rattus* rats. We are shown too at great length that which we know already, viz., that semi-domesticated rats, or rather, rats living in a state of commensalism, are liable to great variation, and that *Mus rattus* in particular is an enormously plastic species. In spite of this and though the unwisdom of naming new species from this group then living under artificial conditions is admitted, publicity is given to a description, under the name *Mus brahminicus* (now of Lloyd) of a New Species (?) which appears to be founded on a couple of piebald semi-albino house rats!\n\nIt is not until we reach the section devoted to Burmah that rats approximating to Malayan forms come under consideration.\n\nIt is noted, and this must be regarded as a concession to the systematist, that amongst many hundreds of Burmese *rattus* examined, not one was found which in colour and size resembled any of the Indian rats but that of the two species present the larger\u2014a white-bellied brown-backed form\u2014seems most nearly to be matched by *Mus jalorensis*, Bonhote, from the Malay Peninsula.\n\nIn the Peninsula, however, *Mus jalorensis*, although not found as a rule far away from the neighbourhood of man is a country rat and the common house rat is a different animal with well defined characters.\n\nThe small race is *Mus concolor* which, though a somewhat variable animal within limits, is a very distinct species. It formed at least 50 per cent of the total rats of Rangoon and at least 75 per cent of the true house rats: and here again, though, not so numerous in Malaya, it is of very common occurrence both in town and country. It has not been recorded from India.\n\nIt is interesting to compare with the Indian returns the occurrence of the various species as noted by the plague investigators in Rangoon. *Mus rattus* together with *Mus concolor*\nformed 72 per cent, *Gunomys* (Nesokia) species 21 per cent and *Mus decumanus* only 7 per cent of the total brought to them. In India the former formed 15 per cent of the total, *Nesokia* species 48 per cent and *Mus decumanus* 37 per cent. In Calcutta the latter was most numerous in the European quarter: in Rangoon it chiefly came from the river-side buildings. So far as investigations have been carried on the house rats of Rangoon and those of other Burmese towns are the same.\n\nNoteworthy is the record for the first time from Burmah of a bandicoot-rat that has recently been separated from the Indian form *Gunomys bengalensis*, and described, from Penang specimens under the name of *Gunomys varius*. The two species overlap in Rangoon where they have been captured in the ratio of three to two.\n\nThe conclusions of the Bombay Plague Commission are quoted. \"With regard to the epizootic amongst rats the following conclusions may be formulated:\n\n(1) *Mus decumanus* and *Mus rattus* are equally susceptible to plague.\n\n(2) The incidence of plague is twice as great on the *decumanus* population as on the *rattus* population.\n\n(5) The *rattus* epizootic is directly attributable to the *decumanus* epizootic\" and it is pointed out that the first and second statement are reconciled and explained by the fact that *Mus decumanus* on an average harbours twice as many fleas as *Mus rattus* and we are further warned that in ports where *Mus decumanus* is firmly established extra danger is always to be looked for from communication between ship and shore since it is the commonest of sea-going rats.\n\nCaptain Lloyd has been criticised but it is to be said that, in spite of faulty grasp of the subject on its zoological side, when he ceases to treat and touch on \"sports\" and the non-urban division of the Murinae his report is most informing and interesting.\n\nSo far as the Malay Peninsula is concerned with the spread of plague epidemics the local animals we must consider in the connection are primarily:\u2014\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nRATS AND PLAGUE.\n\n(1) Mus decumanus, Pallas. The Brown or Norway Rat.\n(2) Mus griseiventer, Bonhote. The Malay House or Roof Rat.\n(3) Mus concolor, Blyth. The Little Rat.\n(4) Of less importance are Gunomys varius, Thomas. The Eastern Bandicoot-rat.\n(5) Gunomys varillus, Thomas. The Little Bandicoot-rat.\n\nMus musculus, Linn. The Common Mouse, is probably harmless; it is in any event so rare as to be negligible and the latter may also be said, with regard to their occurrence in towns, of Mus jalorensis Bonhote, a whitish-bellied member of the rattus group.\n\nThough one or two Indian squirrels are regarded with suspicion, Malayan squirrels\u2014owing to their different habits\u2014need not be taken into account at all.\n\nThe species of bandicoot-rats listed above have recently been described from Penang specimens: Gunomys varius differs but slightly from G. bengalensis Gray, the well-known Indian species and G. varillus, as its name indicates, is a small form of G. varius. The latter has lately been taken in large numbers in Rangoon and has probably been carried thence to Penang in rice-ships. The bandicoot-rats are certainly introduced species in the Peninsula, they seem to have been recorded hitherto only from Penang but I am aware of their occurrence in Singapore though I have never examined specimens. Cantor in 1846 (J. A. S. B. vol. XV), recorded Mus bandicota, Bechstein, (= Bandicota nemorivaga, Hodgs.) from Penang and the Peninsula and this species possibly occurs in Singapore also.\n\nThough the bandicoot-rats are known vehicles of plague hosts, it is probable that they exist in such small numbers locally as to be of minor importance.\n\nMus decumanus is a ship rat which scarcely occurs outside large ports (Singapore, Penang, Malacca and Port Swettenham) though I have taken a few individuals in Johore Bahru. It is one of the most dangerous species owing to the large number of parasites it harbours. And here it may be pointed out that just as the Anopheles mosquito is the conveyer of malaria, and the\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 57, 1910.\nStegomyia mosquito of yellow fever so the rat-flea Pul\u00e8x cheopis is the disseminator of plague which is spread so far as is known at present by its agency alone. The simplest method of eliminating danger from the flea is to destroy the rat on which it exists and of which it is carried about.\n\nMus griseiventer, a somewhat aberrant member of the rattus group approaching M. decumanus in the harsh nature of its pelage and size of feet, is the commonest house-rat throughout the Malay Peninsula\u2014in the southern half at any rate. It is found everywhere in the neighbourhood of man as is also Mus concolor, a diminutive form of Mus rattus with a very spiny coat.\n\nIn external appearance Gunomys varius and Mus decumanus seem somewhat alike on superficial examination and both attain a head-and-body length of nine to ten inches, the latter sometimes reaching nearly a foot. There are however many points of difference.\n\nIn Gunomys varius the pelage is thin and meagre in quantity, especially on the abdomen, and cold in tone, the upper surface being a mixture of black and buff. Its tail is uniformly dark and clad with dark hairs and is somewhat short (about 80% or less of the length of head and body). Its feet have dark hairs on their upper surfaces.\n\nMus decumanus is fairly thickly clad with fur of a warmer colour, that of the back being mingled sooty and ochraceous. Its tail is flesh-coloured on the basal half of the under surface and this area produces pale hairs which contrast with the brown hairs of the brown upper surface: it also nearly approaches (90 per cent) the length of the head and body. The feet are flesh coloured with white hairs on the upper surface. The under surfaces of both animals are of a silvery or smoky gray.\n\nA differentiating character for the genera of Mus and Nesokia (Gunomys) given by Stanford and others is that the upper incisors of the latter are, on the outer surface, sculptured with faint longitudinal grooves while the front teeth of Mus are smooth. Dr. Hossack has, I think rightly, pointed out that this\nis not strictly the case: yet it may be said that while the grooves of *Nesokia* are most distinct, those of the rats are very ill-defined and visible with the help of a strong lens only.\n\nAnother readily observed difference between the two lies in the form of the molars, more especially of the upper series. Those of *Nesokia* are divided transversely into laminae; those of *Mus* sinuously into cusps: these features are shown most clearly when the teeth are worn.\n\nThe body of *Gunomys* is stout, that of *Mus* slender; variations that are again strongly emphasized in the skulls, that of the former being short, broad and deep, robust and solid in construction while the latter is elongate, slender, shallow and of a more delicate appearance: in *Gunomys* the nasal bones fall short of, or never project beyond, the front surfaces of the incisors: in *Mus* the nasals are so elongated that if the skull is viewed from above the incisors are completely hidden. Again, viewed laterally, the zygomatic arch of *Mus* is almost in a plane with the alveolar edge of the upper molars, that of *Gunomys* falls far short of this.\n\nA further notable difference which has not before been remarked on may be seen on the outer surfaces of the ascending rami of the jaw bone. Where on the base of attachment of the masseter muscle we find in *Mus* merely a slight tubercle or protuberance, there occurs in *Gunomys* a distinct upward-pointing spine having between it and the surface of the ramus so deep a gap that the spur appears almost as defined as the coronal point or condyle.\n\n*Mus validus* of which the skull most nearly approaches in form and structure that of *Gunomys* has this tubercle rather more developed than have other rats and in the bamboo-rats (*Rhizomys* Spp.) it is even more exaggerated than in the *Nesokia* group.\n\nThe only comparison *Mus griseiventer* needs for our purpose is with *Mus decumanus*. In both the dorsal pelage is harsh and wiry but not essentially spiny and the abdomen grey or drab coloured. The upper colouring of the former is somewhat warmer, the tail is dark throughout and slightly\nlonger than the head and body, the length of which scarcely ever exceeds seven inches, and the feet are brownish.\n\nFrom all the above *Mus concolor* differs in its small size, head and body being about five inches and the tail half an inch more, and its soft dense upper fur which however is thickly set with flattened grooved spines.\n\nBeyond the species mentioned above there are hardly likely to be others which come within the vision of our local epidemiologist yet though plague is perhaps less to be feared in Malaya than in certain other countries an exact knowledge of the agents disseminating it should be in his possession: it is to be hoped, however; if our Sanitary officers should undertake investigation to this end, that they will have associated with them a colleague acquainted with the zoological side of the subject that their work may be free from that vagueness and uncertainty so frequently obvious in the reports now noticed.\n\nC. B. Kloss.\nResearches on Ptolemy's Geography of Eastern Asia,\nby Colonel G. E. Gerini, M.R.A.S.\n(Review) By W. Makepeace.\n\nThis is Vol. I. of the Asiatic Society Monographs and is published in conjunction with the Geographical Society.\n\nStarting with Ptolemy's Extra-Gangetic Geography, the writer has felt obliged, owing to the uncertainty of previous identifications of place and race names to review all the ancient geography relating to the Seven Seas including that of the Arabs, the Hindoos, the Chinese and the early European navigators.\n\nThe book will therefore become a handbook to the historical student. As the result of his researches the author believes that \"It is perhaps not too sanguine to anticipate that future historiographers of those lands may see their way to adopt the Ptolemaic data as the starting point for their enquiries and narratives to which, even for latter periods, when authentic records fail or are fragmentary, they should be at times of help in understanding the political condition of the country.\"\n\nNot a few sidelights are supplied even in the present volume. One of the points incontrovertibly established, says the author, is that Western trade pushed along the China coast at least as far as the Hang Chou harbour since the beginning of the Christian era.\n\nA useful map is given in which the geographical knowledge of travellers of various nationalities and periods is displayed by the various colours in which the names are printed.\n\nBut the leading feature of the book is the map and series of tables, containing Ptolemy's names, in both of which is shown the authors' own method of rectifying Ptolemy's records of longitude and latitude. This discovery establishes Ptolemy's credit as an accurate geographer.\n\nJour. S. B. R. A. Soc., No. 57, 1910.\nThe identification of Akadra as the modern Kha-Tien on the gulf of Siam furnished the initial base beyond the Ganges which made the work possible. Further identifications based on this disclose by the way that Ptolemy's geography gives us the outposts occupied at that early period by the Indian Colonists who were pressing southwards.\n\nA bold alteration is made to the traditional fixing of Ptolemy's farther coast line of the Magnus Sinus (Gulf of Tonkin). Ptolemy shared the impression of his contemporaries that the coast of Sinai, the modern Hakka country, turned southward to the equator thus enclosing the Green Sea. Colonel Gerini induced by the good results obtained in identifying place names, swings this coast line round the Lin Chau peninsula to the N.E., till it coincides with the actual coast line of China.\n\nSix-hundred and eighty pages are closely packed with discussions on detailed identifications.\n\nTurning to Sec. 6, the Golden Chersonese, we find that up to the date of the Christian era the present southern part of the peninsula was known as Chrys\u00e9 or the \"Golden Isle.\" The last mention of it as an island may be dated about A.D. 50. After that, in Marinos and Ptolemy, it has become a peninsula. Our author thinks that the change of name corresponded with the fact that until our era seagoing ships did ply through the channel broken by ridges of rock, which separated Kedah from Ban Don. The seacaves are now found in the ridges at an elevation of 100 feet but the passage can almost be effected by small boats today and it is suggested that the original channel is a more suitable site for a canal than the Kra Isthmus farther north. The usual trade route however at a later date seems to have led over the Kra Isthmus.\n\nTakota, of which the name is connected with tin or lead, was a mart and lay between the Kra Isthmus and the old sea channel.\n\nWith regard to Palanda, a Malay name in Ptolemy of a town and a river, the notes and the rectification map are in favour of the neighbourhood of Kuala Kampar, though an\naddendum mentions Pahang, while the synoptical map and the tables, which have been revised since publication in the R. A. S. J. 1897, are for a site in Pahang.\n\nTharra, an inland town, is placed in Tringanu, but this arrangement depends on the original identification of Palanda near Kuala Kampar which has been considered the less probable one.\n\nSabana was a mart in Selangor, and Cape Malen Kolon is Tanjong Gelang in Pahang. This name is connected with the name Malaya, which was imported into the peninsula by the early inhabitants of Southern India in their flight from the Aryans.\n\nThe Attaba River is the Tringanu River, and Koli was a town in Kelantan.\n\nThe difficulties with which the author was surrounded must have been immense, and definite conclusions as to the identifications attempted here will perhaps always be doubtful. This section of the book will probably be more useful for the historical and philological research it contains than for anything it proves. It must be remembered too that Ptolemy shortened the Peninsula considerably making the extreme promontories point East and West and that he did not know of land lying South of the Pahang River.\nTwo Religious Ceremonies in Vogue among the Milanos of Sarawak.\n\nBy the Rev. Fr. Bernard Mulder and John Hewitt, B.A.\n\nI. The Payun Ceremony.\n\nThis important function, known to the Malays as Berayun or Brayune, has been several times described and we are only emboldened to add further to the literature on this subject because as yet no complete account has been written. No doubt the explanation of the imperfections of other writers is to be attributed to the fact that this ceremony is only very rarely witnessed by a European and then not in its entirety; it has, however, been the lot of one of us to be present at scores of Payuns. For the relationship of the Payun to the other religious ceremonies of the Milanos we shall refer the reader to a recent paper on Milano religion by Messrs. Lawrence and Hewitt (J. A. I. Vol. 38, 1908); in which paper too will be found a more complete account of 'Bayoh' and of 'Dakans' than we are proposing to give here.\n\nAs a general rule, the Payun is undertaken as a last resort for severe illness and sometimes the ceremony is repeated as a kind of thanksgiving feast when the patient has regained good health. We may mention that the Milanos have no medical practice of their own and it is only within recent years that these people have had acquaintance with Malay or European medicines; now-a-days the Payun is becoming more and more a luxury of the well to do, and the poorer people who cannot bear the heavy expenses of a respectable Payun have perforce to swallow the white man's medicine or to resign themselves to fate.\n\nJour. S. B. R. A. Soc., No. 57, 1910.\nThe dramatis personae of the ceremony are: one, or more usually, several Bayoh of good reputation\u2014a person, male or female who professes to have special power in the world of spirits: the sick person and other seekers after health who may happen to be present: the music makers who enliven the proceedings with the music of gongs of several kinds. The ceremony takes place in the house of the patient: it is usually attended by all the gay life of the neighbourhood, and society sends her representatives to lend their moral support.\n\nIt not infrequently happens that the Payun ceremony for a sick person as first suggested by the dream of some interested old lady, who seeks an early opportunity for suggesting recourse to this ceremony to the relatives of the unhappy man. When it is decided upon, all the preparations are effected so that the ceremony can take place at full moon: the relatives and friends all assist in the tedious operations and at an early date they send for the Bayoh who is to act as master of ceremonies.\n\nUnder the Bayoh's directions, the room is decorated with coloured cloths and with long festoons of plaited palm leaves, whilst hanging from many parts of the room are gay streamers of plaited palm leaves fashioned into fantastic shapes\u2014often of birds.\n\nDuring the actual ceremony, the lights from a hundred tiny candles add to the enchanted appearance of the scene.\n\nThe ordinary apparatus of the Payun, viz. the swing, the boat, the house and the several dakans are often family heirlooms which have been used many times before, but if these are not to hand, it is customary to borrow from a neighbour, or failing that, they must send for a 'tukang' (skilled artisan) in such work. This man's charges are high, for the necessary knowledge belongs only to few, and moreover, the work of making a good boat for instance, occupies several tukangs for many days: the tukang, however, is not a religious person in any sense.\n\nThe day before the ceremony commences, the Bayoh enters the house and there remains as a guest until the Payun is ended eight days afterwards. When all is ready, the room is furnished as follows:\u2014\n\nJour. Straits Branch\n(1) A swing made up of a single long rattan of the kind called 'sega' is stretched across the room; this swing is the most important accessory of the Payun ceremony. It is suspended at each end from a nail in the wall and when not in use is looped up from the middle to a hook on the wall. Dangling from the swing at points not far distant from the two ends are a pair of ornamental tassels of plaited palm leaves in the folds of which are hidden some tiny bells; during the ceremony, these bells are made to tinkle with the vibration of the swing.\n\n(2) From a point near to one end of the swing a long and wide ladder called Tago To of plaited palm leaves leads downwards and below passes into\n\n(3) the Spatong: this is a square wooden receptacle like a lidless box and it contains four wooden images of anthropomorphic shape.\n\n(4) A Rabu (or Rabong): this is a boat usually eight or nine feet long, well made and gaily painted; the specimen in the Sarawak Museum is ornamented with a fine figure-head of crocodilian shape. The Rabu contains as its crew, several anthropomorphic images called 'Sakai' (friends). The boat is suspended from the ceiling by ropes attached to each end.\n\nOutside the room on the open verandah there is to be found another Rabu also containing a crew of images. This one, however, is of much poorer construction and is often made from pith of the sago palm.\n\n(5) An 'Abun': this is a model house of large size, often measuring eight or nine feet in all three dimensions. It is usually made from good wood and in shape rather resembles a Malayan Mosque. Sometimes there is outside the house another Abun much smaller and roughly made of sago pith: this contains a few anthropomorphic images. The latter abun is for temporary use only and at the end of the Payun is carried to the river side where it finds its final resting place.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 57, 1910.\n(6) Several 'dakans': these are rather large \"wooden gaudily painted images of anthropomorphic and zoomorphic shapes. They are supposed to function as temporary abodes for certain spirits, but this only on particular occasions. The 'dakans' of the 'bayoh' ceremonies are legion (see the above mentioned paper on Milano religion), but in the Payun only three or four are used and being of the nature of permanent furniture, the same dakans are used on numberless occasions. The ordinary dakans of the Payun are\n\n(a) To Jien (or To Jin), a wooden man, who being provided with a seat on his back functions as a chair on which the patient takes his rest: the head of To Jien is ornamented with spikes on which lighted candles are fixed: below, he rests on a wooden image carved to represent an 'ikan pari' (a skate.)\n\n(b) Naga terbang, a crude representation of a flying dragon.\n\n(c) Naga Sebalun, also a dragon.\n\nThe nagas are situated one at either end of the swing.\n\nAs we have before mentioned, the essential furniture of the Payun is a swing and whether or not one or several of the other accessories just enumerated are omitted depends on the wealth and influence of the persons concerned. Only in the case of the swing does any idea of sacredness hold: the other articles are merely furniture.\n\nOn the first day of the function, the people assemble just after sunset and without any formalities take their places in the rooms. The ceremony is opened by the head bayoh who goes up to the swing and lubricates it by vigorous hand rubbing with coconut oil. Then taking in his hand some yellow dyed rice he throws it towards the four walls of the room, three times each way, waving his magic wand (the inflorescence of an areca palm) and chanting an incantation the while. This done, the main part of the entertainment, which however consists only of swinging, can be commenced. The head bayoh first mounts the swing: he takes a sitting position\nsupporting himself on either side by resting the palm of the hand and the middle finger on the rotan. When the swing is at rest, the feet of the entertainer just touch the floor, and he starts the swinging by pressing one foot backwards against the floor. He commences by swinging about twenty times in one direction, and turning round on the swing an equal number of times in the opposite directions, all the time he is rhythmically swaying his head and body from side to side and gabbling through an incantation in the obsolete Milano language.\n\nAfter he has finished, the patient takes his turn on the rattan, his movements being controlled by the Bayoh who is pushing from behind.\n\nWhilst the patient is swinging, the Bayoh unceasing in his incantations, from time to time waves on him the magic wand which passing from the head downwards is supposed to sweep out the spirit of the sickness.\n\nWhen the patient has tired himself out, he usually retires from the swing but not infrequently continues until he utterly collapses in a swoon. In such cases he is conducted to another part of the room and there they have resort to a 'Mingat' ceremony. Sitting down by the patient, the Bayoh beats his treasured drum and recites his charms, occasionally sweeping over the patient with his wand or now and then sprinkling rice over his head, and sometimes too an incense burning fire is arranged at the patient's side. When there are no interruptions of this kind, the swing is kept on the move almost the whole time: it is the correct thing for all Bayoh people who may be present to use it and of course all sick people embrace such a favourable opportunity for a cure.\n\nAs each person mounts the swing, the head Bayoh offers him a spear the tip of which is for a brief moment received into the mouth of the applicant when the weapon is at once withdrawn. During intervals in the ceremony when the swing is not in use, the Bayoh places on the rattan an areca inflorescence which is removed each time some one mounts the swing. The movements of the Bayoh when swinging are at first slow, but soon the motion accelerates and the\nincantation becomes louder and louder until at last he is in a perfect frenzy and appears to be quite demented. The excitement amongst the onlookers increases when the bells of the swing begin to tinkle, for this is taken to indicate the presence of a spirit in the rattan. Very rarely, the rattan snaps in the middle, a calamity indeed, for this denotes the presence in the room of an angry spirit; and for the patient there is no hope as he invariably dies within a short time. The ceremony is abruptly stopped and the people return to their homes.\n\nIt frequently happens that the spirits invoked by the Bayoh in his incantation do not respond to the satisfaction of that person; in which case he will mount the swing and loudly invoke the attention of other spirits. This may be repeated several times.\n\nThe Rabu and other accessories of a Payun have quite a minor part to play. When the patient is so ill as to be unable to stay on the rattan, he will enter the rabu which is then set swinging by the Bayoh.\n\nIf there is an abun, the patient and the Bayoh sometime or other during the evening will enter it and there the Bayoh will \"mingat.\"\n\nAs for To Jien, he receives no special attention excepting that the patient often enough makes use of him as a chair; at other times a naga might be thus used.\n\nIf the patient is a young child who cannot undergo the ordinary swinging, it is usual for the Bayoh himself to swing with the child on his knee. Occasionally in a Payun, the Bayoh or the sick man himself will don the dress of a savage warrior and brandishing a sword he will execute a war dance, formerly a favourite amusement of the Milanos. This fascinating byeplay is really of a serious nature, for the Bayoh is in combat with the evil spirit which has brought about the sickness.\n\nThe band which enlivens the proceedings comprises five players with instruments as follows: two large 'Tawak,' two drums and a set of 'Gelinang' (Kromong of Malays). They\nplay in harmony and have several pieces: they are busy during the whole time of the swinging.\n\nThe general programme is much the same every night except that on the first night proceedings are shortened whilst on the last night there is a crowded house and the payun commences at sunset and is continued up to midnight. Every night after finishing, the rotan is hung up on the wall and then guests and all are provided with a meal at the expense of the host.\n\nThe ceremony is not finally ended until escorted by the music makers, the temporary rabu with its contained dakans is taken away from the house to its proper resting place outside the village at the river side: it is fenced round with stakes to prevent the boat from floating away at high tide.\n\nOn one occasion one of us witnessed a curious incident relating to this discarded rabu: a company of young men paddling down stream in a boat approached the rabu and each youth armed with a sharpened bamboo pointed it with threatening gesture in the direction of the rabu and then the whole party fled precipitately and hid themselves; they returned several times only to repeat the same proceedings.\n\nAn amusing side issue of a payun is that frequently the patient, warned in a dream, sees fit to change his name so that the bad spirit shall recognise him no longer: so during the payun and ever afterwards he is known only by his new name. Some Milanos indeed having experienced a number of payuns have a corresponding list of names to their credit.\n\nIn his interesting paper on manangism the Venerable Archdeacon Perham tells us that the manang when treating a sick person often has resort to a swinging ceremony called Berua: The manang sits on a swing and rocks himself with the idea of knocking and driving away the disease. Swinging is also performed in three other manang ceremonies, the 'Betiang garong' the 'Bepancha' and the 'Ninting lanjan.' And again the manang sometimes undertakes to kill the demon (munoh antu). 'In due time the demon is there and the manangs themselves enter the room which is quite dark.\nPresently sounds of scuffling of clashing of weapons and of shouting are heard by the Dayaks outside and soon after the door is opened and the demon is said to be dead. He was cheated into coming to plague his victim as usual and to instead of the sick and helpless patient he encounters the crafty and mighty manangs who have killed him. Further they have a ceremony called the 'Bibandoung api' (displaying fire). The patient is laid on the verandah and several small fires are made round him. The manangs pretend to dissect his body and fan the flames towards him to drive away the sickness.\n\nOn a careful comparison of the Milano ceremonies with the account of Sea Dayak religion as given by the Archdeacon it becomes evident that they have much in common. The chief difference lies in the fact that Milanos have specialised in the direction of Dakanism, whereas this is scarcely known amongst Sea Dayaks. Now excepting within quite recent years Sea Dayaks and Milanos have had no relations with each other the former people being comparatively new comers to this part fo Borneo whilst the latter are often considered as aboriginals; and their languages are quite distinct. We suppose therefore that the bayoh and the manang with their respective ceremonies have most likely descended from great antiquity and perhaps represent to us the religion of the far off common ancestors who lived in some other part of Eastern Asia.\n\nII. The Plato Ceremony.\n\nOne of the most interesting of the religious ceremonies of the Milanos is that known as the Plato. Unlike the Payun a great secrecy is held on the occasion and a Plato is usually conducted in the complete ignorance of Europeans or other foreigners who may happen to live in the neighbourhood. It has therefore never been mentioned in the literature on Milanos.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nThis ceremony takes place some few days or weeks after the death of a Milano and as in the Payun the suggestion arises in the dream of an aged friend: in his dream he learns that the departed spirit is short of some necessity of life such as food or clothing. The object of the ceremony is to communicate with the unfortunate spirit and to supply his wants. Accordingly, they send for a Bayoh who has unquestionable experience in the spirit world and he undertakes to bring satisfaction to the departed spirit.\n\nSo at an early date, a small party of interested friends assemble in the house just after sunset, and with no display and little noise the ceremony commences. At a Plato which one of us had the opportunity of attending, there were two Bayoh of which one happened to be a 'Batut' (vide infra)\u2014who with heads completely shrouded in a cloth, took up their position side by side on a small mat on which they were to journey along the river of death to enter the nether world. Each Bayoh had provided himself with a paddle and whilst on the mat he went through the motions of paddling just as if the mat were a boat floating down stream. They talked aloud in quite a natural manner remarking for example on the swiftness of the current or on some overhanging tree as they passed quickly by: the scenery changed, and here and there were hidden rocks of which the one hurriedly warned his friend: then came an upset with much excitement and awe-inspiring splashing of water\u2014introduced for the purpose\u2014all over the room: but after a while, resuming their journey with nothing worse than a wetting, they glided swiftly down the stream and eventually entered the nether world itself. Here the conversation changed and their remarks referred to the departed souls whom as they recognized, they occasionally accosted. \"What an awful wound Igu has still!\" and \"There goes Mandori as lame as ever.\" Such were their comments on a few deceased friends whose souls they met. When in this nether world the Bayoh often resorts to conjuring tricks in order to impress the nolookers. For instance he grasps at an imaginary object in the air and produces therefrom some tobacco or sireh leaf,\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 57, 1910.\nAll this occupied about half an hour and by this time they were not far from the object of their search. And now falling down on hands and knees they commenced groping about the room clutching at various objects until at last one of them suddenly announced that he had caught the lost soul. This he securely enclosed between his hands and going up to the nearest relative he clapped the spirit on the head of the latter and to prevent escape, tied over the head a piece of cloth. Thus was effected the most difficult part of the work and all rest was straight-forward.\n\nThe Bayoh commenced to talk to the captured spirit whose replies though not audible to the assembly were nevertheless recognised by the Bayoh. Quoth the Bayoh, \"So sorry to see you ill, is there anything we can do for you?\" or \"What sort of a time have you had latterly?\" and the like. Soon the Bayoh uncover their heads and the relative is informed concerning the welfare of the deceased and is instructed to take a sarong, or a cooking pot or some dollars to the grave. This done, the spirit of the dead will rest in peace.\n\nThe application of the deceased spirit to the head of the nearest relative is also followed out during the funeral ceremony. Just as the corpse is about to be removed from the house the next of kin taking a plate or basket in his hand approaches the head of the corpse and affects to shovel up the spirit pouring it over his own head: this he repeats several times. The alleged reason is that the spirit shall not leave the house.\n\nThe Plato is in some degree paralleled amongst Sea Dayaks by a 'catching the soul' ceremony held in cases of obdurate sickness. According to Archdeacon Perham\u2014\"If the patient is apparently in a dangerous state, they pretend the soul has escaped far away, perhaps to the river: and they will wave about a garment or a piece of woven cloth to imitate the action of throwing a cast net to enclose it as a fish is caught; perhaps they give out that it has escaped into the jungle and they will rush out of the house to circumvent and secure it there; perhaps they will say it has been carried away\nover seas to unknown lands and will all set to, and play at paddling a boat to follow it. But more generally the operation is made a more simple one. The manangs rush round the pagar api as hard as they can, singing a not unpleasant chant until one of them falls on the floor and remains motionless: the others sit down. The bystanders cover the motionless manang with a blanket and wait whilst his spirit is supposed to hie away to Hades or wherever the erring soul has been carried, and to bring it back. Presently he revives, looks vacantly about like a man just waking out of sleep, then he rises with his right hand clenched as if holding something. That hand contains the soul: and the manang proceeds to the patient and returns it to the body through the crown of the head muttering at the same time a few words of incantation.\nThe History of the Peninsula in Folk-Tales.\n\nBy R. O. Winstedt.\n\nI am no historian either by taste or training; but as a \"picker-up\" of those \"unconsidered trifles\" Malay folk-tales may I venture to adduce a historical as well as a literary reason for their preservation and suggest a study of them will give additional weight to Mr. Blagden's contention in the pages of this journal that \"evidently in the middle of the XIVth century there were a number of settlements scattered along the coast-line of the Peninsula,\" at a date before the founding of Malacca. Mr. Blagden cites from the Javanese \"Nagarakretagama\" (composed, he tells us, in 1365 A.D.) a passage containing apparently indisputable mention of Pahang, Langkasuka, Kelantan, Trengganu, Tumasik (Singapore), Kelang Kedah, Muar a doubtful allusion to Sungai Ujong and no word at all of Malacca. This passage he considers sufficient to disprove Mr. Wilkinson's view \"that while the southern portions of the peninsula were often visited, they were never really occupied by a civilized race till the Malays came in A.D. 1400\" though it is rather hard to see what proof a list of names of doubtful etymology constitutes. Some further proof of early Malay settlements is needed, and I fancy that the folk-tales of the peninsula may supply it.\n\nNow folk-tales, it must be admitted, require very careful sifting. They may be partly based on actual fact; they certainly abound in fiction. They may obviously deal with a pre-Muhammadan age and yet they always contain many anachronisms. They will tell the same story of several places: Malim Dewa is prince of Pasai in the Achinese version of the tale; prince of Bandar Muar in the peninsula version. The places and persons they refer to may be historical but are generally obscure and forgotten. We can only make deductions on very broad lines. Rhapsodists will always declare how\ntheir tales have historical sequence, though they will add they have lost the links or forgotten how the sequence should run. It is hopeless probably ever to connect the threads. Can the disconnected tangled threads lead us anywhere?\n\nIn the first place, it is hardly likely to be questioned that Malay folk-tales recount the adventures of Malay heroes; they may appear under names more like those of Batak folk of the present day; a princess will be 'Bunga Sa-Kuntum,' a prince 'Helang Laut,' a warrior 'Awang Selampit' from his short skirt or 'Trong Pipit' from his diminutive size; that, of course, is what we shall look in pre-Muhammadan tales.\n\nThe heroes may intermarry with 'Batins' and aboriginal tribes. That it what we know actually to have happened. Still, the tales will undoubtedly paint the adventures of Malay chiefs the leaders of Malay settlers. Again the age of the tales is indisputable. They ante-date Muhammadan influence; at bottom though accretions from the Hindu cosmogony and late historical incident have often crept in, they are early Malayan full of primitive custom. They find a parallel in the pawang sayings, which they resemble in metrical form and sometimes in actual phrase; those sayings of which Mr. Skeat has given us so fine a collection. The early history of Malacca is recorded in Annals tinged with Persian literary influence; the story of its great hero Hang Tuah in historical prose. The story of the old-world kingdom of Bruas, (though it still survives also as a rhapsodist's tale), commanded sufficient interest in historical times to be written down centuries ago in conventional Hindu hikayat form under the grandiloquent name \"Shamsu'l-barain\". So, too the history of Kedah. It is easy to see that stories which have escaped such treatment must have dealt with settlements very early very insignificant perhaps and certainly long since decayed.\n\nHave we evidence, that any of the tales really deal with places in the peninsula? There would seem to be little ground for doubt. In his chapter or \"Early Civilization\" in the peninsula, Mr. Wilkinson alludes to the remains near Pangkalan Kempas on the Linggi river, remains so fragmentary that they\ngive no conclusive evidence of the civilization they represent. Was it Malay? The story of *Raja Ambong* printed by Sir William Maxwell in Number 19 of this Journal records how that chief ruled at Tanjong Bima and his cousin Che Alang in Linggi at Kuala Limau Purut. The story of Raja Donan printed in Number 18 is the story of a chief who lived at Mandi Angin; and there is a place of that name close to Linggi too. The mention of 'Raja Pertokal' in it may well be an anachronism. The tales of Malim Deman and Malim Dewa may be considered more doubtful, seeing that they have been transplanted apparently from a Sumatran setting. But surely that picture of the little settlement at the month of the Muar must have had origin in fact, even if it were originally a description of some Sumatran port.\n\n*Medan-nya indah bukan kepalang.*\n*Rantan-nya luas bagai di-bentang;*\n*Tebing-nya tinggi bagai di-raut;*\n*Pasir-nya serong bentok taji.*\n*Batu-nya ada besar dan kecil,*\n*Yang kecil pelotar balar.*\n*Jika untung kena ka-balai,*\n*Jikalau tidak kena ka-tanah,*\n*Mendelu selawat ibu ayam,*\n*Helang di sambar punai tanah.*\n\nAnd again\n\n*Selup wangkang bergendingan,*\n*Beri-jenis-jenis gada-gada-nya;*\n*Ada yang merah gada-gada-nya,*\n*Muatan sutera dan mastoli;*\n*Ada yang putih gada-gada-nya*\n*Muatan lilin dengan getah;*\n*Ada yang ijau gada-gada-nya*\n*Muatan kesumba dengan malau;*\n*Ada Yang kuning gada-gada-nya;*\n*Muatan mas dengan perak;*\n\nIn *Malim Dewa*, mention is made of places I have been unable to identify, if they are actually historical, Medan Baik\nwhose chief was Laksamana, Nyiur Chondong said by the rhapsodist to be in Malacca. These two tales of Muar, I was told by the rhapsodists, deal with events comparatively recent as compared with those of other peninsula tales.\n\nMr. Wilkinson finds more conclusive evidence of \"powerful Buddhist states like that of Langkasuka\" in the North than of any permanent colonies in the South. The folk-tales perhaps bear out this theory. There are far more of them in the north than elsewhere, a number as yet uncollected. The hero in Awang Sulong is by origin from Pati Talak Trengganu, whatever that may mean.\n\nThe \"Tatap\" and \"Prang Selampit\" are indisputably Kedah tales; and the tradition that \"Lindangan Bulan\" is an old name for Kedah has never been questioned by any rhapsodist I have met, though it must be confessed that it is sometimes the name of a princess also. I may add, that I have collected from Patani a tale \"Raja Lotong\" which like Sir William Maxwell \"Sri Rama\" owes its source to the Ramayana, whose cycle provides the plots of that wa'yang Kulit peculiar to the North.\n\nThe boundary of the new Perak territory has brought into prominence a name of old-world fame, the river Langkasuka: it is to be hoped that the entrance of European officers into the states now taken over may throw fresh light on the forgotten history of primitive settlements in the peninsula. Meanwhile, I would urge, that the collection of simple folk-tales is not quite such an idle employment as it many at first sight appear.\n\nI append a brief analysis of various tales, giving the names of all the places to which allusion is made in them. Perhaps others may be able to identify places unknown to me. It is interesting to note how Bengkalis just across the Malacca Straits comes into several of the tales, northern and southern.\n\nRaja Ambong reigned ever Tanjong Bima. His cousin, a man of Linggi, lived at Kuala Limau Purut, seven days' sail away but to be reached also overland by crossing a laut tawar.\nRaja Ambong voyaged to Champa, Chala, Tanjong Jambu Lipa, Teluk Jambu Ayer, Dong Sip, Tanjong Chamara Bunga, Pulan Mayang Manggi. His skill in fencing came from \"Si Raja Nandong who inherited it from Sang Barma Dewa in the land of Menangkabau.\"\n\nRaja Donan born in a land called Mandi Angin. After a year's wandering at sea he meets the fleet of Raja Chamar Laut of Mundam Batu. Raja Chamar Laut was fleeing from Raja Pertokal (?Portugal), who however had run aground at Lubok Goa Batu. Raja Donan visits and conquers the land of Gedong Batu ruled by Bendahara Mangkubumi and also the land of Biram Biru ruled over by Raja Piakas.\n\nAwang Sulong: (the 'Hale' version, collected in Negri Sembilan) born at Kuala Sungai Batu, where up-river lived Dato Alam. Embarks in his magic boat at Teluk Buaya and goes down river passing Pulau Pisang, Pulau Belachan, Pulau Jelutong to Sungai Parun where Nakhoda Tua is overlord. He sails to Gunong Berapi, where Raja Mukhdum Sakti rules.\n\nAwang Sulong: (Pawang Anu's version): Awang Sulong's father and mother were rajas of Pati Talak Trengganu but before his birth had sailed away to Bandar Mengkaleh (or? Bengkalis) where the Batins had given them a kingdom. He is born there after his mother returns from a picnic at Tanjong Jati. She dies and Batin Alam (who had married his aunt) brings him up. One day he sets off down river past Pulau Pisang, Pulau Belachan and Pulau Jelutong and sees a 'galleon' belonging to Nakhoda Tua the father of princess Sri Jawa; the mate is a man of Tiku-priaman, the steersman from Pulau Lant. Awang Sulong visits Pati Talak Trengganu, Pasir Panjang and eventually Semarang in Java.\n\nMalim Deman. Prince of Bandar Muar.\n\nMalim Dewa. Prince of Bandar Muar. Mention is made of the land of Medan Baik, ruled over by Laksamana; of Kuala Ayer Batu, ruled over by prince Jong Karang; of Teluk Sina Tanjong Papan ruled over by Raja Pertokal; of the land of Goa Baru Blang ruled over by Raja Sianggrai a relative of\n\nR.

Raja Tebuan Tanah, ruler of the land of Lindongan Bulan (said to be Kedah) sails away to Bandar Mengkaleh\u2014which had just been worsted by Awang Selampit Tebuan Tanah and Awang Selampit encounter in the sea called Bulan Trang, for Awang Selampit is on his way to the land of Lindongan Bulan: Tebuan Tanah is killed: his wife bears him a posthumous son Duli Baginda, who on growing up sails off with Trong Pipit, Jerun and Glam to avenge his father's death. They visit Bandar Mengkaleh (and capture Awany Selampit) and sailing in the sea called Bulan Trang descry Teluk Gunong Emas pulau ketiga, where Duli Baginda marries a princess and becomes Sultan but eventually returns thence to Kuala Kedah.\n\nTatap. The Raja of the land of Nibong Hangu\u0161\n\nG\u0119dong sa-ribu\nB\u0119ma sa-laksa\n\nAttacks the land of Payong Pa\u2019 Ali Gunong sa-janjar a Raja of Pasai aids him. But the princess Sa-Payong Panji defeats him, attacks in turn and takes the land of Nibong Hangus, and then the land of Rotan Glong, ruled over by Johor Alam; and finally conquers negeri Maghrib.\n\nRaja Lotong. The hero\u2019s father reigns at Tanah Rendah Kebun Bunga. The hero visits a Sungai Jelujok ruled over by Raja Tikam Batu.\nShort Notes.\n\nAntiquity of Malacca.\n\nIn my Notes on Malay History in No. 53 of this Journal I said that Malacca is not mentioned in any known authority prior to the early years of the 15th century, with the possible exception of the old Chinese charts therein discussed. I find however in Colonel Gerini's recent monograph on Ptolemy's Geography of Eastern Asia, pp. 531-2 that the \"Palatine Law\" of Siam entitled \"Kot Monthieraban,\" enacted in A.D. 1360 by the king who founded Ayuthia ten years earlier, mentions Malaka as one of the southern States then tributary to Siam, or claimed by him as such, at any rate. This is an important piece of evidence in support of the view that Malacca existed before the time of the fall of Singapore, which all the available evidence puts somewhere after A.D. 1377. But of course one would like to be sure that this Siamese law-code has not been \"sub-edited\" and revised since that date. It is however quite possible that Malacca was founded earlier than is traditionally stated, but only rose to importance after the fall of Singapore.\n\nAs for other names mentioned in the same context, they are Ujong Tanah, Malayu and Worawari. The first offers no difficulty. It is geographically explained by its name. As for the second, it is difficult to believe that Malayu was ever the name of a state in the Malay Peninsula. It is not distinctive enough. It might mean Malayland anywhere. In the Nagarakretagama it distinctly means Sumatra. Probably the Siamese had no very definite information on the subject and did not realise that it could not be a state-name. Likely enough in this context it merely implies a claim over the Peninsula as a whole. The last name, Worawari, is a puzzle that no one has yet solved. Colonel Gerini offers various\n\nJour, S. B., R.A.Soc., No. 57, 1910.\nsuggestions about it, one of them being that it stands for Muar, which seems hardly probable. Perhaps local knowledge may throw some new light upon it: the name may still exist in some modified form somewhere in the Peninsula.\n\nC. O. Blagden.\n\nHermanus Neubronner Van Der Tuuk.\n\nThe venerable Professor Kern in an interview which I had with him at Utrecht last spring informed me that it had recently been discovered that H. N. van der Tuuk, the founder of Malayan comparative philology, was born in Malacca. His father was a high Dutch official and his mother a member of the well-known Neubronner family of that ancient Dutch settlement. He was educated in Holland and devoted himself to the study of the languages of Netherlands India. But in virtue of his birth at Malacca we are entitled in some measure to claim him as one of our local worthies and to share with our Dutch friends and neighbours in honouring the memory of one of most distinguished men born in the Malay Peninsula,\n\nC.

George Maxwell.\n\nThe first arrival of the Portuguese in the Far East was, as is well known, in A.D. 1508 when Diogo Lopez de Siqueira visited Malacca on a voyage of discovery. The failure of the enterprise is recorded in the Commentaries of Afonso Dalboquerque. The King of Malacca set a trap to arrest de Siqueira and his companions at a banquet on shore, intending then to seize the fleet. The plot was however frustrated by a Javanese woman who had a lover amongst the Portuguese sailors, and who, hearing of the intended treachery, swam off by night to the fleet and warned the Portuguese. When the plot was discovered, the King of Malacca seized Ruy de Aranjo, the Portuguese factor and some twenty Portuguese who were with him on shore collecting cargo, and threw them into prison. De Siqueira was unable to effect their release, and sailed away back to Portugal.\n\nIn a footnote in the Hakluyt Society's translation of the Commentaries of Afonso Dalboquerque I found a reference to a manuscript in the British Museum giving two brief accounts of de Siqueira's disastrous voyage to Malacca.\n\nR.A.Soc., No. 57, 1910.\nBy the kindness of the British Museum authorities I have been able to get copies of the manuscript which I have had translated. The two accounts are, as will be seen, extremely scrappy, but as they give the only record of an epoch making voyage, they are, I think worthy of publication.\n\nThe manuscript bears number \"Additional M. S. 20,902, folio 11 and 11b,\" and runs as follows:\n\nJorge de Aguiar, Captain Mor\u2014Year 1508.\n\nJorge de Aguiar set sail on the 9th April in command of eight vessels.\n\nCaptains: Vasco Carvalho, Ruy da Cunha, Jo\u00e3o Raiz Pereira, \u00c1lvaro Borreto, Tristao da Silva, Gon\u00e7alo Mendes de Brito, Francisco Pereira, Pestana, who wintered in Quilova. Besides these eight merchant vessels, there were four small vessels for the war of Ormus, Duarte de Lemos being in command of these last.\n\nCaptains: Jo\u00e3o Cola\u00e7o, Gon\u00e7alo da Silveira, Diego de Attaide, Fero Correa, and Diogo Correa. [A marginal note says; 8 vessels on the 9th April, and 4 others, some say 5.]\n\nIn this year Diogo Lopez de Siqueira, Almotacel Mor of the kingdom, set sail on the 5th April, as commander of four vessels to discover and conquer Malacca.\n\nCaptains:\n\nIn the Sta. Clara\u2014Jeronimo Teixera, Gon\u00e7alo de Souza, and Jo\u00e3o Nunes. He returned with all the ships in safety to the kingdom. Another report is as follows:\n\nJorge de Aguiar, Captain Mor, set sail on the 9th April with thirteen sail of which the Captains were:\n\nTristam da Silva;\nJo\u00e3o Roiz Pereira in the Botafogo;\nVasco Carvalho;\n\u00c1lvaro Barreto in the Sta. Marta;\nFrancisco Pereira Pestana;\nGon\u00e7alo Mendez de Brito;\nJo\u00e3o Cola\u00e7o;\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nDiogo de Atayde;\nDuarte de Lemos da Frofa in the Sta. Cruz;\nVasco da Silveira;\nPero Correa;\nDiogo Correa, his brother;\n\nOf these seventeen ships, the four first, under the command of Diogo Lopez de Siqueira, were to discover the Island of Sao Louren\u00e7o, and not finding there the silver, cloves and ginger, of which the reports spoke, they were to proceed to discover the town of Malacca.\n\nOf the thirteen under command of Jorge de Aguiar, eight were for cargo, and the other five were to be employed under his command in guarding the coast of Ethiopia and Arabia.\n\nEvents\u2014On the journey from Malacca to India the Sth. Clara struck on a reef and foundered. Diogo Lopez gave her captain Jeronimo Teixeira, Joao Nunez\u2019s ship (as he was vice-captain.)\n\nGon\u00e7alo de Souza\u2019s ship was fired, there being no men to man her.\n\nJorge de Aguiar was lost by night off the Tristao da Cunha Islands.\n\nFrancisco Pereira Pestana wintered at Quiloa where he went as captain.\n\nIt was to effect Ruy de Aranjo\u2019s release and \u201cto chastise the Malays for the treason which they had practised upon Diogo Lopez de Siqueira\u201d that Alboquerque attacked Malacca. He captured it on the 15th August 1511.\n\nMiscellaneous Notes.\n\nMalays have a number of \u201cwords of command\u201d with which they guide their cattle in ploughing. The words, I believe, alter in the various states or the peninsula. The following short list gives the words used by the Malays of Kedah and Perlis.\nBi\u2014 go on\u2014(The word is also used by the Siamese. It is also used by elephant drivers in Kedah and Perak; vide journal No. 45 p. 42).\n\nChah\u2014 turn to the outside\u2014(Used when ploughing in a field to tell the animals to turn towards the edge of the field. The Siamese say \u2018cheh\u2019.)\n\nSo\u2019\u2014 turn to the inside (The opposite of \u2018chah\u2019. It is said to be a contraction of \u2018masok\u2019. It is also used by the Siamese.)\n\nRong\u2014 turn round\u2014(The form \u2018long\u2019 is also used. It is said to be a Siamese word. In some places the ordinary Malay \u201cpaling\u201d is used.)\n\nJ\u00fb\u2014 keep quiet\u2014(This word is only used to bullocks. With buffaloes \u2018diam\u2019 is used. It is used when the animal is alarmed by anything. The Siamese, substituting a \u201ct\u201d for a \u201cd,\u201d say \u2018tiam\u2019 to their buffaloes.)\n\nS\u00f4rot\u2014 \u2018back\u2019\u2014(This is used to make the animal step back a pace or two. It appears to be a purely Malay word, but I can not find it in any dictionary.)\n\nW. G.
